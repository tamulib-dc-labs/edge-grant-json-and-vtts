WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:04.233
Beer, a little bit of whiskey.

00:04.273 --> 00:06.217
How often did you see Aggies drunk?

00:07.479 --> 00:11.587
It was rare, very rare.

00:11.927 --> 00:17.337
When you were a company commander, did you ever have to deal with drunkenness in the dronatorium?

00:17.698 --> 00:19.501
No, no.

00:20.383 --> 00:22.907
And Aggies, they smoked.

00:23.228 --> 00:26.494
What would be your guess as to how many Aggies smoked?

00:28.448 --> 00:29.471
I don't know.

00:29.551 --> 00:30.573
I smoked at that time.

00:30.714 --> 00:31.877
What did you smoke?

00:31.897 --> 00:32.418
Cigarettes.

00:32.518 --> 00:32.939
What kind?

00:34.142 --> 00:35.004
I don't know.

00:35.726 --> 00:36.769
Pale male, probably.

00:36.789 --> 00:37.390
Pale male?

00:37.410 --> 00:38.633
Yeah.

00:38.653 --> 00:40.939
Did Aggie smoke cigars?

00:41.122 --> 00:46.150
Sophomores at football games would smoke cigars.

00:46.170 --> 00:46.991
To show off.

00:47.011 --> 00:48.934
And blow smoke and fresh in his face.

00:50.016 --> 00:54.002
But that was about the only time you ever saw him buy a cigar.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.604
And not pipes?

00:56.065 --> 01:03.737
Well you would see some affected people that would smoke a pipe, you know, they thought it looked cool, but very seldom.

01:03.717 --> 01:10.707
Very seldom ever saw that, except at baseball games.

01:10.747 --> 01:20.681
And that's one of the reasons I didn't go to many baseball games as a freshman, because the sophomores would make you chew tobacco when you went down there, and I didn't want to chew tobacco.

01:21.963 --> 01:29.674
And did you and your buddies even, had you even heard any of the words associated with drugs?

01:30.869 --> 01:38.567
Well marijuana, we used to kind of kid around, usually it was the musicians that

01:40.252 --> 01:46.081
that we claim, you know, use marijuana and blacks supposedly use marijuana.

01:46.101 --> 01:47.583
But did you ever see anybody?

01:47.603 --> 01:53.171
I never heard of anybody, never knew of anybody that ever used marijuana.

01:53.191 --> 01:55.254
It was more of a joke than anything else.

01:57.398 --> 02:05.770
Back to being a company commander, did you have or were there any problems that you had to deal with as a company commander in your outfit?

02:06.357 --> 02:07.238
That's your memory?

02:07.258 --> 02:08.960
I really can't think of, think of any.

02:09.461 --> 02:12.184
You didn't have to worry about kicking somebody out or?

02:12.284 --> 02:12.944
No, no.

02:13.045 --> 02:14.606
Never had anything like that.

02:15.027 --> 02:17.710
What was your favorite punishment to inflict on?

02:18.431 --> 02:25.639
Well, cadets didn't, didn't do too many punishments other than, you know, might give somebody some demerits or something.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.760
For, for what?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.382
Well, for their, their room or,

02:28.902 --> 02:30.004
I don't know.

02:30.024 --> 02:37.154
It just, it just didn't, you know, the, there wasn't a punishment system, system in effect really.

02:37.554 --> 02:43.362
But what if somebody, in Aguilingo, what if somebody lipped off at you?

02:44.884 --> 02:46.647
Well you could always kick them out of your outfit.

02:46.887 --> 02:47.588
Did you do that?

02:47.768 --> 02:48.149
Never did.

02:48.189 --> 02:51.454
I don't remember anybody ever lipping off to me.

02:52.074 --> 02:56.040
What were you most proud about that year?

02:58.602 --> 03:00.325
Well I thought we had a pretty good outfit.

03:01.648 --> 03:17.539
Well we didn't have any trouble and we usually placed pretty good in all the indices that told about the company, about how well you graded in the parades and things like that.

03:18.127 --> 03:30.363
Now in ranking the core outfits, intramurals and the review scores and all, were grades part of that, academic grades?

03:32.346 --> 03:36.231
I'm really not sure that, I'm not sure how that factored in.

03:36.291 --> 03:42.379
I know that General Moore Trophy was the big thing and I, grades must have factored in there somewhere.

03:44.249 --> 03:48.758
But most people came down here and went to school four years and graduated.

03:49.480 --> 03:59.273
So you know academics wasn't, and they weeded out, the weak ones got weeded out, usually the first semester, if not the first semester, in the first year.

04:00.355 --> 04:06.624
Chemistry 101, for example, was one of the things that weeded them out.

04:06.644 --> 04:11.510
And I guess English 101 as far as I'm concerned was one of the weeders out.

04:11.590 --> 04:17.158
But there were a lot of people that left at the end of the freshman, end of the first semester

04:18.337 --> 04:21.782
And then there were a number that were on probation, academic probation.

04:22.623 --> 04:30.153
But after that it was, you know, you made pretty good grades and there wasn't too much concern about it, you know.

04:30.213 --> 04:32.656
If you made it through your first year, you're going to make it four years.

04:33.277 --> 04:37.983
And it was, I don't know that I knew many people that went to summer school.

04:38.003 --> 04:45.373
I know some people that went to the Aggie Rest Camp which was southwest Texas and that's what they called it and they'd go over there and take chemistry.

04:46.467 --> 04:47.709
That was one of the big deals.

04:47.769 --> 04:53.397
I think they just went over there because they'd go swimming and there was a nice swimming pool there and a lot of girls.

04:54.759 --> 05:05.374
I'm assuming that you and your buddies did not, as I and my friends did, we didn't calculate our GPA every semester and know exactly what it was to the hundredth.

05:06.115 --> 05:07.817
Oh, no, no, no.

05:08.236 --> 05:12.441
In fact I think they'd give it to you I guess when you got your grades or something.

05:12.501 --> 05:16.886
But see, you had to have, I'm not sure what it was.

05:17.107 --> 05:18.869
At that time it was a three point system.

05:19.750 --> 05:23.935
And I think you had to have a 1.5 to be considered for the RVs.

05:24.055 --> 05:27.920
So that's what I was striving for, is making sure I had at least a 1.5.

05:29.302 --> 05:32.065
But my junior year is when I really made good grades.

05:32.525 --> 05:35.509
I didn't have any distractions and I sat down.

05:35.776 --> 05:43.011
And I studied every afternoon, every night, and made, started making some A's for a change, you know.

05:43.031 --> 05:43.272
All right.

05:43.392 --> 05:48.102
Now, with those accomplishments, to whom did you express your pride?

05:49.886 --> 05:50.487
I'm not sure.

05:50.527 --> 05:52.511
Your grandmother, your mother?

05:52.572 --> 05:55.658
Well, I'd tell them what my grades were, but I never did.

05:56.363 --> 06:01.352
You know, my grades were never such that I could go around and express a whole lot of pride, you know.

06:02.014 --> 06:03.576
I was kind of a B.C.

06:03.596 --> 06:06.863
student, but I had a lot of fun doing it.

06:09.067 --> 06:15.739
Still with being a company commander, so you didn't have to deal with any particular great problem.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.281
Not that I can remember.

06:17.742 --> 06:17.902
Okay.

06:17.942 --> 06:18.923
Not that I can remember.

06:19.383 --> 06:20.885
And no, and no tragedy?

06:21.025 --> 06:23.107
Nobody got hurt badly or anything like that?

06:23.348 --> 06:24.449
No, no, no.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.270
Anything like that?

06:27.072 --> 06:28.953
How much did that, when did you get that ring?

06:28.994 --> 06:29.914
How much did it cost?

06:30.916 --> 06:33.999
Well, I'm thinking it cost 80-something dollars, but I'm not sure.

06:34.279 --> 06:36.601
And I hitchhiked down here.

06:37.643 --> 06:38.784
I think I hitchhiked down.

06:41.406 --> 06:42.908
At the end of my,

06:44.693 --> 06:49.139
End of my junior year I believe it was, to pick it up during the summer.

06:50.241 --> 06:51.463
How did you feel when you put it on?

06:51.483 --> 06:52.484
Oh great, great.

06:52.604 --> 06:54.387
I told them I wanted the biggest and the blackest.

06:55.148 --> 07:03.079
I'm sorry over the years that I didn't take it off like when I washed my hands or take it off at night.

07:03.140 --> 07:07.726
And I think night is the most destructive time because you're moving your hands.

07:07.746 --> 07:11.832
It's just like moving it on an emery board on sheets.

07:12.149 --> 07:20.282
And I should have taken, if I'd have taken it off every night, taken it off when I washed my hands and taken it off when I worked, it might have been in better shape.

07:20.382 --> 07:23.146
Now you can't, you can't read the class or anything else.

07:23.206 --> 07:24.428
It's just all smoothed over.

07:24.749 --> 07:25.570
But it has character.

07:25.911 --> 07:27.934
Do you have some Aggie ring stories?

07:29.376 --> 07:33.643
When I, I wanted to be the Commandant at A&M for many years.

07:33.743 --> 07:34.725
I thought about it.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.908
That's one of the things I wanted to be, do.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.528
Now this is not general officer track.

07:40.548 --> 07:52.603
See, I decided a long time ago I didn't care why I was a general officer or not because I never had met many generals alike, you know, because of their personality and they had to have to get there.

07:52.663 --> 07:57.569
But anyway, so I thought, well, you know, I would like to, I would like to be the commandant at Texas A&M.

07:58.009 --> 08:08.042
And I was over in Germany and found out that Parson had extended, so I extended a year in Germany and I was trying to get the job and wrote

08:09.052 --> 08:18.763
Clyde Wells and Tiger Teague and Jack Williams and I don't know who else I wrote, you know, telling them I wanted the job.

08:19.664 --> 08:38.907
And anyway, I was up for it my last year in Germany and found out that they had, and this is my fifth year in Germany, found out that they had sent a colonel down from the Pentagon to interview for the job.

08:39.325 --> 08:40.547
And he wasn't wearing his ring.

08:41.648 --> 08:44.171
Well you know you've got to strike against you right there.

08:45.072 --> 08:47.916
So he wasn't wearing his ring and there were some other things too.

08:47.976 --> 08:49.518
But anyway he didn't get the job.

08:49.598 --> 08:52.462
And so my daughter was a freshman down here.

08:52.982 --> 08:56.286
In fact she was living over in the Corps areas in the civilian dorm.

08:56.867 --> 09:04.136
And her boyfriend was a squadron commander over there so, and Parsons knew that my daughter was over there.

09:04.457 --> 09:07.881
And so he called over and had my daughter come over to see him.

09:08.080 --> 09:19.694
And this was about April, I guess, of 76, I guess, or yeah, 76.

09:20.155 --> 09:25.141
Anyway, my daughter had been home at Christmas, so it had been 77.

09:25.181 --> 09:32.410
My daughter had been home at Christmas, and I had slipped on the steps and hit my hand on the steps.

09:32.630 --> 09:34.172
They were iced over.

09:34.220 --> 09:35.441
And I broke my ring.

09:35.621 --> 09:36.182
It was broken.

09:36.282 --> 09:39.044
So I hadn't had it repaired, so I wasn't wearing it.

09:39.765 --> 09:53.298
And so she went over to see Parson and Parson said, now, you know, we're going to, I'm going to call your father and tell him if he wants, wants this job that we've turned down the other guy and we want to, we want to interview him and for him to get on over here.

09:54.199 --> 09:59.023
And then she told him about this guy wasn't wearing his ring and she thought, oh, daddy's not wearing his ring.

09:59.063 --> 10:01.105
So she called me and said, daddy,

10:01.473 --> 10:05.240
Whatever you do, get that ring fixed because you've got to wear your ring.

10:05.601 --> 10:08.487
And that's the reason the other guy didn't get the job.

10:08.527 --> 10:10.491
Well there were other reasons I think.

10:10.511 --> 10:18.587
So anyway I got my ring fixed real quick and when I came over I was wearing my ring and I made sure everybody saw I had my ring on.

10:18.854 --> 10:24.784
Have you been other places, some perhaps other side of the world where wearing that ring?

10:25.385 --> 10:32.117
Well, I've run into people, you know, here and there, you and Aggie, but usually it's me asking them if they're an Aggie rather than them asking me.

10:32.858 --> 10:35.843
And you never lost it and it miraculously reappeared?

10:35.863 --> 10:36.023
No.

10:36.885 --> 10:40.491
One I love to tell, when I ask Ray Bowen this,

10:40.471 --> 10:54.410
He said that while he was a graduate student at Cal Tech working on his master's, he was at, I believe, University of Heidelberg and he and three German buddies, graduate students, are taking the train across the Alps to Venice.

10:55.050 --> 11:00.217
And he said, here's this very well-dressed lady, older than he, reading a newspaper on the train.

11:00.758 --> 11:04.363
And she kind of glances over it and she said, oh, you're from Texas A&M?

11:04.943 --> 11:05.845
Well, yes, ma'am.

11:06.025 --> 11:06.686
How did you know that?

11:06.706 --> 11:07.487
Well, I saw your ring.

11:07.988 --> 11:09.870
Well, how did you know that?

11:10.373 --> 11:11.855
My husband went to A&M.

11:11.895 --> 11:12.976
You might have heard of him.

11:12.996 --> 11:14.017
His name is H.B.

11:14.037 --> 11:15.559
Zachary.

11:15.579 --> 11:15.839
Oh, yeah.

11:15.859 --> 11:19.324
And he said, yes ma'am, I have.

11:19.344 --> 11:19.844
Let's see.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.050
Final review, the final day.

11:25.651 --> 11:27.233
What thoughts went through your mind?

11:27.273 --> 11:28.274
Who came?

11:28.915 --> 11:34.221
Well, I think my grandmother and my mother and my aunt came down.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.636
And, you know, I was just ready to get out.

11:37.639 --> 11:41.107
I couldn't go in the Army because I wasn't 21.

11:42.451 --> 11:47.322
So I had a regular commission, but I couldn't get my regular commission until I was 21.

11:47.423 --> 11:51.332
So I had a kind of a piddly job lined up in

11:52.088 --> 11:58.736
Temple because that was right next to Belton's where my fiancée, my fiancée, my girlfriend was.

11:58.756 --> 11:59.477
But you were serious.

11:59.497 --> 12:10.391
Yeah, we were serious enough that I wanted a job there and that was the only job I could find in Temple and it was selling gas refrigerators door to door.

12:10.731 --> 12:18.441
Now if you've ever tried to sell anything door to door it's tough and gas refrigerators, which was a new thing on the market, was really tough.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.825
So I stayed there about

12:22.463 --> 12:25.687
oh, I guess through part of the summer.

12:26.468 --> 12:34.819
And then I went down to try to find out when I'm going to be called active duty because I was 21 on July the 15th and the war had started, see.

12:35.120 --> 12:39.085
The war had started in June 24th, I think, or 5th.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.009
And, you know, I wanted to get, I wanted to get in the war.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.151
So I didn't know where to go.

12:44.171 --> 12:48.157
I went to the recruiting station and the guy said, well, just wait, they'll send you your orders eventually.

12:48.197 --> 12:50.800
Well, he didn't know anymore than I knew about it.

12:51.269 --> 12:57.256
went down to Fort Sam and told them, look, you know, I'm 21.

12:57.316 --> 12:58.437
I've got the regular commission.

12:58.857 --> 13:01.320
I need a job.

13:01.420 --> 13:03.903
I'm starving to death because I quit that job there.

13:04.344 --> 13:07.928
Said, you know, I need a job and I need to get going.

13:08.008 --> 13:12.112
So they said, well, we'll put you on active duty for two weeks.

13:12.172 --> 13:14.335
By that time you'll have your orders.

13:14.975 --> 13:19.200
So I went to Fort Hood for two weeks and I went home and no orders.

13:19.653 --> 13:23.102
And finally in September I got orders and got called in.

13:24.486 --> 13:28.957
I was concerned about getting in the Army when I graduated.

13:29.017 --> 13:36.497
I was concerned about having the girlfriend and belting and seeing her as much as I could.

13:38.637 --> 13:41.081
I was concerned about that job I was going to do.

13:41.141 --> 13:43.705
I really didn't want to do, but that was the only thing I could find.

13:43.725 --> 13:44.988
So those were my main concerns.

13:45.108 --> 13:48.694
How well prepared did you think you were when you graduated?

13:49.715 --> 13:50.156
For what?

13:50.637 --> 13:51.178
For whatever?

13:51.619 --> 13:52.660
I prepared for the Army.

13:53.622 --> 14:04.560
Because I went in, I went in the Army and I'd been there 11 days and they made me a company commander of a, it was kind of a provisional training company, but I was the company commander.

14:04.658 --> 14:07.562
What had A&M taught you?

14:07.582 --> 14:09.665
Well, it taught me how to be a soldier, I think.

14:11.147 --> 14:11.787
Explain that.

14:12.589 --> 14:15.332
Well, I knew the soldier skills.

14:15.953 --> 14:16.574
And what are they?

14:17.635 --> 14:20.079
Well, shoot, move, and communicate, I guess.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.783
But, you know, how to do things, how to march.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.227
And also, isn't it how to work with people?

14:26.427 --> 14:32.455
Well, yeah, it's how to get along with people, how to get people to do what you want to do, even though they don't want to do it.

14:32.924 --> 14:42.097
Were there some people here that you now realize were important in your development of those skills or experiences here?

14:42.377 --> 14:49.827
Well, I don't know that really I could say that there's any one individual, but, you know, I always observed people and saw how they operated.

14:49.887 --> 14:57.438
Like I said, our military instructors were very good, the way they treated us, the way they acted and imported themselves.

14:58.479 --> 14:59.961
That would always impress me.

15:00.397 --> 15:09.732
Now, commencement was held at Guyon?

15:10.774 --> 15:12.536
No, our commissioning was in Guyon.

15:12.777 --> 15:13.077
Okay.

15:13.378 --> 15:16.062
And I think commencement was at Kyle Field.

15:16.342 --> 15:17.705
Okay.

15:17.725 --> 15:22.572
In fact, Bob Hope, you know, you mentioned a while ago who had come down here.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.936
I saw Bob Hope at Kyle Field.

15:27.076 --> 15:29.060
Did he do an outdoor show?

15:29.080 --> 15:31.805
Oh yeah, an outdoor show.

15:31.825 --> 15:33.548
Do you remember who the commencement speaker was?

15:35.612 --> 15:44.308
No, I think General Gey was the, Hobart Gey was the commissioning officer, I think.

15:45.301 --> 15:47.704
And I don't remember who the commencement speaker was.

15:47.764 --> 15:53.551
And was just like in my days as a junior, name was called.

15:53.972 --> 15:54.433
Oh, yeah.

15:54.493 --> 15:57.577
Everybody went across the stage, yeah.

15:57.597 --> 16:02.823
And is there such a thing as Aggie Spirit?

16:02.843 --> 16:04.225
Well, I think there is, yes.

16:04.385 --> 16:09.732
What creates it?

16:09.752 --> 16:10.092
I don't know.

16:10.132 --> 16:12.135
It's just kind of something that's

16:12.773 --> 16:17.760
you kind of absorb what you've been down here a while.

16:18.121 --> 16:20.344
Are there some events that contribute to that?

16:20.945 --> 16:36.267
Well, yeah, I think, you know, football games and the spirit of the football games, you know, the athletic events and the Silver Taps and the Aggie Muster and just listening to the old Ags tell stories.

16:36.753 --> 16:40.658
What about final review and commencement?

16:40.678 --> 16:46.505
Well, final review and your corps outfit and the esprit de corps you have in the corps and the corps outfit.

16:47.106 --> 16:49.548
And I think that's what a lot of these students are missing.

16:49.589 --> 16:52.812
And all of those are inclusive, not exclusive?

16:52.893 --> 16:55.876
No, they're inclusive, yes.

16:55.896 --> 17:04.887
And did it matter much in your era whether a kid was from a rich family or not?

17:05.373 --> 17:09.378
The only way you knew anybody had very much money is if they had a car.

17:09.418 --> 17:11.721
Like I said, very few people had a car.

17:12.562 --> 17:13.904
But it didn't make any difference, you know.

17:14.505 --> 17:24.257
In fact, I had one guy in my outfit who was, you know, who to this day is a multimillionaire, Tim Word from San Antonio.

17:24.277 --> 17:29.924
And his dad, Dean Word, had, they built every highway between San Antonio and Austin, I guess.

17:30.064 --> 17:35.211
And, you know, he was a big contractor and, you know, we knew that he had a lot of money.

17:35.815 --> 17:42.163
And we knew that he had a lot of money, but he was just another one of the good old boys in the outfit.

17:42.183 --> 17:48.330
And I probably already asked this, but what did you learn at A&M that has been important in your life?

17:50.633 --> 18:04.590
Well, one thing I learned as a freshman, and that was how to take abuse and how to remain cool and calm in a crisis

18:06.140 --> 18:19.353
And I think that paid off, especially in combat, you know, when things would really be bad and, you know, if anybody had to be cool, you had to be cool, and you had to be calm.

18:20.134 --> 18:26.561
And I think that's, from being a freshman in the Corps, certainly helped me that way.

18:26.581 --> 18:35.910
All right, now, but then on the positive side, about leadership, what did, what all did you learn?

18:36.008 --> 18:39.993
Well, you know, it's hard to, first of all, it's hard to describe leadership.

18:41.055 --> 18:50.767
I think one thing is watching other people and seeing how they do things and seeing what works and what doesn't work.

18:52.549 --> 18:56.835
And then trying to adapt what works and avoid what doesn't work.

18:58.520 --> 19:05.331
But treating people fair is really the basis of the whole business.

19:05.371 --> 19:13.164
If you treat people fair and square, then you can deal with them if you're reasonable.

19:14.246 --> 19:21.979
If you could be a consultant to A&M's leadership today, what advice would you give them about

19:22.499 --> 19:29.612
making A&M's future as bright as possible, as good as, you know what I mean to tell you?

19:29.752 --> 19:31.480
Every male has to be in the Corps.

19:32.995 --> 19:39.386
And that would ensure some leadership because they'd have a chance to be led and lead.

19:39.426 --> 19:44.114
And I'm not sure how much they get that on the other side of the campus.

19:44.174 --> 19:49.963
Now, they may get it, you know, a lot of them go into leadership positions in the MSC and things like that.

19:49.984 --> 19:51.306
So that, you know, that's good.

19:51.766 --> 19:59.239
But there are a lot of them that come down here and go through and walk out of here with about zero personality when they came in with zero personality.

19:59.540 --> 20:08.188
And I saw that a lot when I was here, you know, just watching some of these people.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.931
What other advice would you give them?

20:10.951 --> 20:20.800
I'm not sure I could give them a whole lot of advice on leadership other than, you know, just treating people with respect and with dignity.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.902
How large should A&M be?

20:24.424 --> 20:25.665
I think it's plenty big.

20:26.219 --> 20:30.264
See, if I could be the king, it wouldn't be as large as it is.

20:30.284 --> 20:31.105
Well, it wouldn't either.

20:31.145 --> 20:34.028
I would say, you know, 20,000 to 30,000 people.

20:34.629 --> 20:36.571
But politically, you could handle that.

20:36.651 --> 20:39.494
But I think it's big enough now.

20:40.255 --> 20:48.464
What I'm afraid of is it's going to become more and more an elitist school and that you have to be really in the upper crust to get in.

20:48.545 --> 20:52.049
And the good old boys that I went to school with aren't going to get in.

20:52.449 --> 20:55.973
See, when I came here, you had to have a high school diploma.

20:57.067 --> 20:59.500
You had to have a couple hundred bucks

20:59.699 --> 21:01.461
and an ability to hitchhike.

21:01.481 --> 21:05.104
And if you had those three things, you could get to A&M and you could go.

21:05.144 --> 21:07.246
That's about what it took.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.730
Do you know what the literal written requirements were?

21:11.170 --> 21:11.911
The fine print?

21:12.491 --> 21:14.093
The citizen of the state of Texas.

21:14.133 --> 21:15.034
I don't know what it was.

21:15.054 --> 21:16.636
You had to have a high school diploma.

21:16.876 --> 21:17.336
Yeah.

21:17.356 --> 21:19.018
Nothing was said about grades or class rate.

21:19.699 --> 21:21.020
No felony convictions.

21:21.500 --> 21:21.600
Yeah.

21:21.620 --> 21:23.042
And no communicable diseases.

21:23.062 --> 21:24.463
Oh.

21:24.483 --> 21:24.583
Okay.

21:24.603 --> 21:25.624
That was it.

21:25.644 --> 21:26.105
That was it.

21:26.705 --> 21:26.805
Yeah.

21:26.825 --> 21:28.407
I guess we could add those.

21:28.387 --> 21:46.924
If, let's make believe someone walks up to you and gives you a check for a million dollars with only one requirement, you must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you decide how it will be spent, what would you want it to go for if you had the capacity to give a million dollars?

21:47.824 --> 21:54.911
Well, I think I'd say let's have 90 percent of the Corps of Cadets, and then I'll figure out who gets the other 10 percent.

21:55.151 --> 21:57.313
But what would you have the Corps do with it?

21:59.656 --> 22:03.241
Well, they've got a lot of unfinanced needs over there.

22:03.862 --> 22:11.933
And, you know, they raised 30-something million dollars, but still they've got like endowment for the band, so the band can always go on a trip.

22:12.754 --> 22:15.397
Endowment for the RVs, so if they're invited, they can go.

22:16.158 --> 22:19.803
See, when I was over there as a commandant, most of this stuff came out of these people's pocket.

22:21.185 --> 22:24.870
Cav needs an endowment where they can go and do what they need to do.

22:25.390 --> 22:36.962
They need to, they're trying to develop a leadership, leadership course for non-contract cadets so they'll get leadership training.

22:38.964 --> 22:49.654
The mentor program, give people some kind of rewards for faculty that, that spend time academic, you know, academic advisor, things like that.

22:49.994 --> 22:53.558
They're, a million dollars would just be a drop in the bucket.

22:55.040 --> 23:00.625
Are there some people from your undergraduate days to whom you feel grateful?

23:02.988 --> 23:05.610
Students, faculty, staff, advisors?

23:06.651 --> 23:11.496
Well, Spike White, I think he helped pull that little small group of friends.

23:11.516 --> 23:15.099
See, we started out with about, I think, 38, and we wound up with 12.

23:16.321 --> 23:22.026
And the reason we stayed, hung in there, Spike White had a lot to do with it, a lot of counseling.

23:22.512 --> 23:28.041
And Newt Cole, who was the preacher, who gave us religion when we needed it.

23:30.425 --> 23:35.052
And then I had some guys in my outfit that were awfully supportive.

23:35.072 --> 23:40.060
There's Arthur Ray Hanks, who was over in Longview.

23:40.080 --> 23:49.515
I had Felix, oh, Felix Daly, who was,

23:49.765 --> 23:50.786
who was a good friend.

23:51.507 --> 23:53.108
We were all freshmen together.

23:55.050 --> 23:58.794
And I always thought a lot of Jarvis Miller.

24:00.116 --> 24:03.119
See he was president when I was the commandant.

24:03.139 --> 24:06.082
So we had it going for a while.

24:08.084 --> 24:10.767
And I don't know really any of my problems.

24:10.807 --> 24:18.034
Roland Bing was a great supporter who was, I couldn't think of his name all ago, but Roland Bing in student publications.

24:18.959 --> 24:23.586
was certainly kind of a mentor, I guess you'd say.

24:23.626 --> 24:30.095
But I pretty well, you know, I didn't really have anybody I needed to lean on.

24:30.115 --> 24:33.079
You know, I pretty well was self-sufficient the whole time I was here.

24:33.800 --> 24:34.782
At least I thought I was.

24:35.142 --> 24:39.148
All right, now I've only got one more question I can think of for your student years.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.912
Have we left anything out that we should have included?

24:42.500 --> 24:44.282
that you think of about student years?

24:44.302 --> 24:46.325
Well, I can't think of anything really.

24:47.507 --> 24:47.607
Okay.

24:47.627 --> 24:54.316
All right, then my last question is, what feelings do you carry in your heart today for Texas A&M?

24:54.537 --> 24:55.097
Oh, I love it.

24:55.698 --> 24:56.019
I love it.

24:57.120 --> 24:57.380
Why?

24:58.542 --> 24:59.844
I don't know.

24:59.924 --> 25:01.947
It's been everything to me in my life.

25:03.509 --> 25:06.613
You know, wear that ring with pride and take pride in the school.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.396
I don't know.

25:08.416 --> 25:10.639
It's just like I've got the Aggie spirit.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.321
That's a good ending.
