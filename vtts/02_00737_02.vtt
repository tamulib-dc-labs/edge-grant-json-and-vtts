WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:11.108
I have an indication here that you served for a 
couple years as an officer in the architectural

00:02.680 --> 00:11.108
club. Yes. Was that only architectural majors, or 
could other students belong to that, too? There

00:18.415 --> 00:19.777
weren't majors there. They're just architects. 
Yeah, that's right. And you were at what? Were you

00:23.160 --> 00:26.403
in the college of agriculture? I was president of 
it the last year, yes. Was that, let's see, was that

00:28.381 --> 00:32.187
point it was in the College of Agriculture, wasn't 
it? More or less landscape architecture?

00:34.210 --> 00:34.730
Engineering. Engineering. Dean Nigel's school. 
Who was your faculty sponsor, if you recall? I'm

00:46.528 --> 00:52.577
assuming that the club has had faculty sponsors 
then as they do now. Well, we had two. Our first was

00:53.698 --> 00:56.262
Alice Berger. And then the last year was,

00:57.440 --> 01:09.196
I don't recall his name now, but he was head of the 
department. Was this architectural club tied in

01:09.777 --> 01:22.435
with some other, a nationwide students 
professional organization or it was just a local

01:09.777 --> 01:22.435
thing? Was it primarily, was it more inclined 
towards a professional aspect of architecture or

01:22.752 --> 01:29.843
was it really more of a social organization? 
Professional. Professional. You met, regulated

01:32.087 --> 01:36.814
to discuss architectural problems then? Yes. And 
I also had an indication, you were an assistant

01:37.155 --> 01:46.009
editor of the Architectural Yearbook. Was that a 
fairly common thing then? Did the various

01:50.528 --> 01:55.477
disciplines publish separate yearbooks? Well, 
the architectural department had a yearbook,

01:55.538 --> 02:01.690
yes. This would be what? Did you have pictures of 
the students in them? Mostly student work. It

02:09.310 --> 02:13.154
would be drawings that the students had done 
during the year. There were projects they had done

02:13.194 --> 02:15.856
during the year. And then as the editor and 
assistant editor, I guess, would be the ones who

02:15.876 --> 02:22.342
would choose which drawings would appear in the 
book? With the faculty. They always worked with

02:24.064 --> 02:26.086
us. And you also were on the battalion staff for a 
couple of years, I believe. Yes. What role did you

02:30.410 --> 02:32.712
play on that? Old little cartoons once in a while. 
Anything else? No,

02:39.010 --> 02:44.896
I don't. As art editor of the Longhorn, I gather you 
did most of the drawings that appear. No, a big part

02:50.662 --> 02:55.527
of that job is getting the other guys to work for 
you. I did quite a few and I really enjoyed it. In

03:03.783 --> 03:07.346
previous years you did some of the drawings for 
other editors. Yes.

03:13.052 --> 03:23.662
Did the art editor have anything to do with the 
makeup of the Longhorn or did the printer decide in

03:13.052 --> 03:23.662
what order the various segments? Now I know the 
Longhorn is divided into the various classes and

03:23.682 --> 03:30.769
has the military aspects and the social clubs and 
so forth. Did you have much to say about how it was

03:31.357 --> 03:36.103
organized, or did somebody else do that? No, no. I 
don't know whether student staff did that, but

03:38.225 --> 03:44.733
they, in general, followed the pattern of 
previous issues. Okay, and I believe you were also

03:46.155 --> 03:50.520
a member of the Ross Volunteers. Yes. Was that for 
one year or two? Just one, last year. And how were

03:55.045 --> 03:57.448
you named to that organization? I think my 
roommate got me in. It wasn't my military ability.

04:03.750 --> 04:08.881
Okay, it was supposed to have been, even at that 
point I believe, it was supposed to have been

04:03.750 --> 04:08.881
somewhat of a crack drill team. Did you do a lot of 
extra drilling? Yes, we did. Okay, and so you

04:14.293 --> 04:16.197
had... Double drill then, I take it, with your 
regular company? Well, not really double, but

04:19.905 --> 04:21.646
extra. Uh-huh. Regular drill with your company? 
Yes. And about how often did you have that, if you

04:25.410 --> 04:28.112
recall? The RV drills? No, the regular company 
drill. Oh, I think every day. Uh-huh. For about how

04:34.418 --> 04:35.259
long? Oh, in the afternoon, for an hour or so. And 
then how much did you drill for the RVs? I don't

04:45.303 --> 04:50.570
know, probably once a week or something like that. 
What did the Ross Volunteers as a group,

04:50.590 --> 05:01.324
what did they do or what was their contribution to 
the school, I should say? Did they serve any

05:03.167 --> 05:11.698
function other than... Well, they served as an 
honor guard on special occasions and

05:16.825 --> 05:18.947
I think that was the principal thing. And I think 
they had a dance, a big dance. Oh, yes, the RV dance

05:21.570 --> 05:26.356
in the spring was one of the three big dances. What 
were the other two? The Thanksgiving hop and the

05:28.037 --> 05:30.740
final ball. And I believe you had something to do 
with the decoration of one of the Thanksgiving

05:31.161 --> 05:36.367
tops. Oh, yeah, I got rubbed on that, too. Would 
this be something that would take you an awful lot

05:38.469 --> 05:42.934
of time to prepare all the decorations, or...? Not 
a great deal. These were held where? In Spiesel

05:46.743 --> 05:47.464
Hall. Spiesel Hall. So you would have to, what, 
kind of get the people together to clear out after

05:48.025 --> 05:57.556
you'd had the regular meal or it was in the same 
dining area where you had the regular meal? Yes,

05:57.576 --> 06:03.042
they gave us a paper sack lunch at noon and then we 
cleared the hall. So you had the whole afternoon

06:03.503 --> 06:05.565
then to get it ready? Yes. I think about the, I had 
more fun than I would have at one of the dances, but

06:12.142 --> 06:24.214
They put meal on the floor, and then we'd take bales 
of hay with ropes tied around them, and after we

06:12.142 --> 06:24.214
swept the meal off, polished this floor. And some 
of the girls came down there peeping in, and we got

06:25.134 --> 06:32.201
them in there and were having chariot races with 
them on those bales of hay. This would be some of the

06:33.222 --> 06:35.204
girls that had come down for dancing? For the 
dance. So this was when you were cleaning up after

06:36.846 --> 06:39.448
the dance? No, this was before the dance, 
polishing the floor. Oh, to get the floor

06:42.444 --> 06:47.313
polished. So you said they put meal on the floor? 
They put meal on it for several days so you wouldn't

06:51.440 --> 06:54.986
spill anything on it. And then when they swept that 
off, you had to polish the floor. This was so it

07:01.157 --> 07:03.221
would be nice and smooth for the dance? That's 
right.

07:06.682 --> 07:11.209
I imagine those chariot races must have been 
something to behold. A lot of fun. We slept that in

07:13.593 --> 07:20.303
on the upperclassmen.

07:22.025 --> 07:27.053
You graduated then in the spring of 1920. And I 
presume you either had or sought a job at that

07:27.505 --> 07:32.892
point. Did you have a job? Yes, I had a job when I 
graduated and I went to Abilene and I was out there

07:34.975 --> 07:43.626
about seven years in the same office. For whom did 
you work then? David S. Castle. And that was, what

07:48.732 --> 07:53.238
was, was that a contractor or an architect? 
Architect, engineer. Did he specialize in any

07:55.501 --> 07:59.905
particular kind of building? We did principally 
educational and institutional commercial work.

08:07.994 --> 08:10.136
Very little residential work of that type. Has 
that been sort of what you've done pretty much all

08:10.997 --> 08:16.322
the time? Yes. Institutional rather than 
residential. Have you done any residential work?

08:20.406 --> 08:21.407
Yes, some. So you were with Castle? Yes. Who were 
some of the other people for whom you worked? Well,

08:32.496 --> 08:35.861
when I left there I went to San Antonio. I was with 
Adams and Adams down there for about a year. And

08:42.329 --> 08:48.778
then I went to Lubbock with Peter Strange and 
Bradshaw. And we were there until the Depression

08:49.855 --> 08:53.739
got us. Which was what, about 1929 or 30? Well, we 
had work that lasted through until 32. And we went

09:01.047 --> 09:04.851
over to the oil boom in Longview in 32. And so was 
there a lot of building going on because of the oil

09:05.592 --> 09:10.277
boom? Yes. And so did the whole office move from 
Lubbock to? By degrees. We didn't intend to, but we

09:18.863 --> 09:21.285
did before we left. And so you stayed with Peters 
then? Yes. Right on through until when? Oh, until

09:27.752 --> 09:31.916
World War II. He was an Aggie. He was a senior when I 
was a freshman. This was Peters? M.L. Peters.

09:39.404 --> 09:39.604
Uh-huh. And at the beginning of World War II then, 
what, you left Peters and went to somebody else?

09:48.935 --> 10:02.094
Well we went into this defense work that I told you 
about of building the Longhorn Ordinance over on

09:48.935 --> 10:02.094
Caddo and then we went together up to Canada. And 
then where'd you go to after that? From Canada I

10:06.461 --> 10:15.955
came back and I was out in the Mahoga Desert for 
almost a year again on we were constructing a naval

10:16.508 --> 10:21.315
armaments test station at Inyo Kern. At where? 
Inyo Kern. And then after that you went where?

10:28.726 --> 10:32.532
After that I came back and went in business here. In 
Amarillo? Yes. How did you happen to choose

10:34.274 --> 10:35.876
Amarillo? Well when I was in Lubbock I had become 
quite familiar with Amarillo and had friends up

10:37.178 --> 10:43.748
here.

10:46.816 --> 10:53.185
Okay, so you were, what was the name of the company 
that you were in? Guy A. Carlander. Guy A.

10:55.408 --> 10:56.930
Carlander. Yes.

11:00.435 --> 11:02.599
And how long were you with that? I was with him again 
about seven years and then I left and three of us

11:13.563 --> 11:16.948
organized our own office here. And that was what? 
Howard Ensign was the name that went under Ensign

11:21.074 --> 11:27.323
and Fowler and Wright. And you have since retired, 
I take it? Yes, I was with Ensign until I retired the

11:32.711 --> 11:40.262
first of January in 69. So you've continued to live 
in Amarillo since and have continued your

11:41.153 --> 11:47.840
artwork. Yes. Are you active in any other 
endeavors?

11:53.807 --> 11:54.808
Not particularly. Of course, I'm a member of the 
American Institute of Architects and the Texas

11:55.969 --> 12:06.300
Society of Architects and the Panhandle chapter.

12:10.651 --> 12:13.835
And except the local. Going back to your career for 
a little bit, I believe before we started the

12:13.855 --> 12:27.392
machine earlier, you indicated that you did a good 
bit of watercolor of the sketches of buildings.

12:27.993 --> 12:28.673
Right. That, I take it, was your specialty with the 
various companies? No, no. There's not enough of

12:34.394 --> 12:37.018
that required. I did general work, a great deal of 
designing. Well then, would the company then have

12:45.751 --> 12:53.804
somebody else who would take over those plans and 
see that the contractor followed them in

12:45.751 --> 12:53.804
construction? Yes. Did you ever do much of that? A 
little bit, not much. Could you indicate a few of

12:58.390 --> 13:04.462
the other jobs on which you worked? Any 
outstanding buildings that you can think of? Two

13:08.831 --> 13:15.784
of my favorites are the high school down at Lubbock 
High School, they call it now. And that was built

13:16.165 --> 13:17.528
when? In 1929. And I'm quite proud of that job. It's 
still being used and added to. And it's one of their

13:28.232 --> 13:31.777
big high schools down there. And I enjoyed very 
much the first Presbyterian church in Kilgore,

13:32.679 --> 13:38.589
Texas. Fortunately, they had good funds over 
there, and they allowed us to do a real nice Gothic

13:39.871 --> 13:45.340
church. I gather they have a good bit of oil money 
over there, do they not? Oh yes. And when was that

13:49.844 --> 13:54.230
one, when did you design that one? In about 39 and 
40. So it was in the, just before the war then,

13:59.137 --> 14:03.082
wasn't it? Yes. Any other ones which kind of stick 
out in your memory?

14:10.987 --> 14:13.270
Well, we've done quite a bit of church work. I also 
like the First Presbyterian Church. Mr. Peters

14:17.035 --> 14:24.766
was a presbyterian, as you may have gathered, in 
Longyear. It's a nice church. Was that another one

14:26.869 --> 14:28.952
that was done during the oil boom? Late part of it, 
yes, latter part of it. And did you begin with the

14:34.426 --> 14:43.600
idea and then put the idea on paper, or is that 
basically what you did? Well, you don't have a

14:45.623 --> 14:47.967
whole idea at once. You develop the thing by stages 
and whatnot. When you sit down, say, to design a

14:52.214 --> 15:02.830
church, do you draw the profile first and then the 
floor plan, or do you do the floor plan first and

14:52.214 --> 15:02.830
then the... Well, you spend a lot of time studying 
their problem and their organization of the

15:03.468 --> 15:12.217
different Sunday school and different 
departments. And then you begin to put together

15:13.198 --> 15:17.603
units to fit those various things. And then you tie 
them all together, basically with a floor plan

15:18.424 --> 15:28.294
first, but keeping in mind what it's going to look 
like in perspective. I suppose you could do a very

15:30.130 --> 15:40.726
utilitarian building that wouldn't look very 
nice, and you could also do a building that looks

15:30.130 --> 15:40.726
very nice, but it's not very utilitarian. Quite 
right. So I suppose the ideal is to get a

15:43.771 --> 15:47.336
combination of the two. Yes. The present accent is 
more on a good plan that's workable and

15:49.239 --> 15:58.753
serviceable and let the exterior fall where it 
will. Back when I started, it was the other way.

16:02.389 --> 16:11.643
Exterior was an important thing, and maybe you'd 
cramp the plan or what a little bit to fit into the

16:02.389 --> 16:11.643
type of exterior you wanted. I've had very little 
personal contact with architects, but I have

16:13.606 --> 16:27.728
heard, well, I lived in New England for a number of 
years, and I've heard a number of people there who

16:13.606 --> 16:27.728
complained A neighboring community to us built a 
large new high school and for some reason or other

16:28.113 --> 16:44.381
the architect had installed a number of things 
which were kind of superfluous really for the

16:28.113 --> 16:44.381
school and it really increased the taxes. I think 
he put in a large mural on the exterior which made

16:44.421 --> 16:53.496
the school look nice but he didn't make it a better 
school.

16:54.370 --> 16:59.697
Were some of the, were the, you mentioned that when 
you first started the emphasis was on an outward

16:54.370 --> 16:59.697
appearance. Did, would this include such things 
as, as murals and... Oh no, most of the work then was

17:00.158 --> 17:07.007
classic. And classic is severely balanced. Maybe 
a continuous deal and terminations and all of

17:10.612 --> 17:19.163
those motifs and uh... That was the principal 
thing in the design, and then if you had to cramp the

17:20.425 --> 17:28.498
exterior, the interior a little bit to fit into 
that as a floor plan, you did.

17:31.243 --> 17:46.888
Now with buildings not away from the classic 
theme, it's easier to do

17:31.243 --> 17:46.888
units that are more varied and more flexible. But 
you would think that today's architect works

17:47.037 --> 18:09.710
with, say, an organization needs a specific floor 
space and he has to stick with that and the space

17:47.037 --> 18:09.710
requirements take precedence over the outward 
appearance. Yes. Does that bother you at all? Not

18:14.697 --> 18:15.258
at all. Not at all. I think it's... natural result.

18:22.189 --> 18:47.841
What would you say had been some of the, in addition 
to this, say the shift from outward

18:22.189 --> 18:47.841
appearance to emphasis on space considerations, 
what else have been some fairly significant

18:22.189 --> 18:47.841
developments in architecture and construction 
over the past number of years

18:51.517 --> 19:00.569
Well, of course, the primary thing is our use of 
steel, which opened up possibilities that were

18:51.517 --> 19:00.569
limited before. There's a lot of difference in how 
much you can span with steel as compared to putting

19:02.091 --> 19:09.461
a stone lintel over two posts. What about glass? 
Frankly, I think glass has been overdone. You

19:16.270 --> 19:21.237
didn't ask for my opinion, but I couldn't help but 
throw it in. We have made all glass exteriors, and

19:21.588 --> 19:37.782
then we go in and have to curtain the light to subdue 
it, and we have to add extra air conditioning

19:21.588 --> 19:37.782
because of the heat infiltration and all of those 
things. I think there's a happy medium there. In

19:40.925 --> 19:45.109
other words, you think there ought to be a few more 
bricks and a little less glass? A little more

19:45.549 --> 19:50.093
masonry, let's say, to break people getting mad at 
us. Well, I gather the ever-increasing amounts of

19:51.592 --> 20:02.944
steel would be one of those things which would 
permit a greater use of glass. Yes.

20:07.089 --> 20:14.176
A

20:07.089 --> 20:14.176
little more time. Anything, any other comments 
you would care to make on... developments, say

20:21.832 --> 20:24.815
recent developments in architecture?

20:28.619 --> 20:33.364
No, I don't feel like I'm qualified to comment. My 
day has passed. Since you have retired, have you

20:36.186 --> 20:43.874
dabbled in any kind of architecture other than the 
painting you do? No, I practiced architecture

20:43.894 --> 20:51.822
until I was 70 and then I thought it was time for me to 
quit and let the younger fellas take over. So have

20:52.730 --> 20:57.479
you done any kind of consulting? Have you looked 
over a set of plans to see that they were ? No, no one

21:03.611 --> 21:05.575
has asked that.
