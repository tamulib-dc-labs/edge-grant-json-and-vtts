WEBVTT

00:04.098 --> 00:08.505
We were talking about the treatment and the 
medicine.

00:11.710 --> 00:24.489
Was there ever any danger that, as far as when 
you're in surgery, that you might have drug

00:11.710 --> 00:24.489
addiction at all, or did they keep that regulated? 
No. In fact, now, although I do have a lot of pain, I

00:27.053 --> 00:32.822
control the pain basically with hypnosis. When 
did you learn hypnosis? I picked up on hypnosis in

00:41.601 --> 00:48.348
high school and was sort of self-taught and 
practiced. Later in college I ran into a doctor

00:49.109 --> 00:59.839
there that used hypnosis for childbirth and he led 
me down a good path. it became very useful when I was

01:00.545 --> 01:05.371
smoke jumping. I could lay down almost anywhere or 
hypnotize myself and say I'll wake up in 30 seconds

01:06.031 --> 01:27.036
or 5 minutes or whatever and that's during smoke 
jumping some of the times that was most rest I would

01:06.031 --> 01:27.036
get for maybe one or two weeks at a time. That's good 
training for when you were in Yes.

01:33.692 --> 01:41.301
Have you ever seen any patients or know of any 
patients who have become addicted to drugs while

01:33.692 --> 01:41.301
in the VA?

01:45.346 --> 01:59.003
Oh, I know patients that are addicted to drugs that 
were vying out at the VA, but now where this was

01:45.346 --> 01:59.003
caused from the VA or by themselves, I don't know. 
Do they have any drug abuse programs

01:59.995 --> 02:09.689
for these people at the VA itself, or do they have to 
go outside? I don't know, Wally, if they have drug

02:10.671 --> 02:13.996
abuse. I know they have one complete war there that 
they have for alcoholics,

02:14.416 --> 02:29.378
which I believe alcohol is a drug. So it's, 
although it's a legal drug, they have a program

02:29.729 --> 02:45.526
there, and I know people who are alcoholics, and 
it's real sad. As far as your therapy, how did they

02:48.008 --> 02:59.280
prepare you for your, you know, to get your 
artificial leg? and prosthesis?

03:03.839 --> 03:15.972
Just like any other medical facility would with 
physical therapy and fitting of the leg and so on

03:03.839 --> 03:15.972
and so forth. I know at that time I had a very 
difficult time. I was in traction for three

03:22.899 --> 03:25.903
months. I became allergic to anything that sticks 
like I and I was in skin traction so what they would

03:29.821 --> 03:56.672
do would put a stockinette around your skin pull 
the skin down over the bone at the end of the stump

03:29.821 --> 03:56.672
and they start out using tincture benzoin or tough 
skin and I became allergic to that and then

03:29.821 --> 03:56.672
surgical easy I can came allergic to that and and 
you just have to clean off the leg every day and

03:57.091 --> 04:03.437
reapply it and so on. I think this was mainly 
because of Agent Orange.

04:12.865 --> 04:18.570
How long was it before you were able to try the 
prosthesis the first time? About six months. What

04:21.973 --> 04:26.777
was that experience like the first time you had it 
on? Very

04:29.238 --> 04:34.065
unusual.

04:41.296 --> 04:49.548
First of all, most people who lose a limb, they 
think they can put a prosthesis on and just get up

04:41.296 --> 04:49.548
and walk away. But it doesn't happen that way. I've 
seen a lot of amputees, and I've never seen one that

04:53.834 --> 04:58.401
could do it. and some people adapt to it very well 
maybe because of the way their bone structure is

04:58.887 --> 05:28.287
and so on and so forth or skin and whatever but I had 
extremely a lot of difficulty with mine because of

04:58.887 --> 05:28.287
skin breakdown and things like this and that is the 
main reason why I was in the hospital so long was

04:58.887 --> 05:28.287
because of this I read something in one book that I 
was reading, but I really never understood it. And

05:33.739 --> 05:37.164
that was the subject of what they called phantom 
pains. Did this ever occur with you? I think all

05:39.827 --> 05:42.711
amputees have phantom pains. The medical 
background is that your nerves

05:44.493 --> 05:55.827
that go down the spinal cord are one long nerve 
clear down to like your toes or your fingers and if

05:56.212 --> 06:25.257
you cut off that nerve then it's cut off but your 
brain still gets the impulses from that nerve when

05:56.212 --> 06:25.257
it's stimulated even though where it's cut off 
from and although you don't have that limb you can

05:56.212 --> 06:25.257
feel things in that and it feels just like the limb 
you had. And this is the reason why is when that

06:32.582 --> 06:38.487
nerve is stimulated then you get the same feeling. 
Is there ever, do you learn to adapt with it or is it

06:40.449 --> 06:47.276
just something that happens? Well at first you 
generally have a lot of them and eventually I think

06:54.262 --> 07:01.351
you reprogram your brain to eliminate that. Now, 
there is a period, a period of time that

07:01.371 --> 07:17.850
maybe you can look and see that one of your limbs are 
gone, and you know it's gone. You can feel it so

07:19.733 --> 07:24.218
strong that your heart doesn't believe it. is the 
way I have to put, and lots of times it took me about

07:26.324 --> 07:39.396
three or four months before my heart accepted the 
fact that it was gone.

07:43.099 --> 07:46.162
When were you released from Brooks? On what day? It 
was in January of 68.

07:53.289 --> 07:55.791
Since that time, Talking about compensation from 
the government, has the government made

07:56.682 --> 08:08.132
available the funds for you to live comfortably, 
or have you had any trouble with this? It's almost a

08:08.693 --> 08:12.776
full-time job finding the government for your 
benefits.

08:15.218 --> 08:20.643
What are the biggest problems that you see in this, 
the funds? Right now, I cannot be employed And

08:26.348 --> 08:45.876
under the VA regulations, it says that if you're 
60% or more service-connected disability and

08:26.348 --> 08:45.876
cannot be employed, then you can get 100% for 
unemployment.

08:47.088 --> 08:55.057
And I've been finding them for, I guess it's going 
on five years, to regain my 100%. I have not

08:56.338 --> 08:57.820
succeeded yet. How can you find them? What methods 
do you use? Well, there's a regular chain that you

09:02.144 --> 09:09.012
go through, review boards and so on and so forth.

09:13.376 --> 09:16.740
What is your opinion of these federal agencies who 
make the disability evaluations?

09:23.288 --> 09:33.666
In

09:23.288 --> 09:33.666
some cases, it's not the federal agency. I know 
when I got caught up with it, it was because of the

09:34.107 --> 09:39.817
Carter administration. And before Jimmy Carter 
was running for re-election. He already had in the

09:48.796 --> 10:01.927
mail that everybody who was under 55 years of age 
and was not 100% service-connected disability

09:48.796 --> 10:01.927
would be reviewed. And I got caught up in that 
review, and I got mine taken away from me. I have not

10:10.115 --> 10:12.597
gotten it back since. And the funny thing was, just 
after the election, all these reviews went out

10:13.977 --> 10:24.569
immediately after the election. Have you found 
that President Reagan has been more helpful, or

10:24.990 --> 10:31.137
has the situation improved? In some degree, it's 
improved, but maybe because of it. Now, I'm

10:39.727 --> 10:41.048
also... have disability from Social Security. 
And that took a long fight to get that. But between

10:49.402 --> 11:00.081
my military retirement and my Social Security 
disability that I can live comfortably. But the

11:01.483 --> 11:06.732
difference between 80% and 100% with the VA is not 
only a lot of medical benefits, but also there is

11:07.252 --> 11:16.003
the difference of approximately $500.

11:21.591 --> 11:26.617
What sort of an insurance plan do you get?

11:30.162 --> 11:35.048
Well, I have a government insurance plan that is 
being paid for now. When I was in the service, there

11:37.772 --> 11:41.297
was no government insurance. You had to buy your 
own insurance, which I had then. But since then,

11:45.162 --> 12:04.647
since I've had higher disabilities add on, since 
my injury, that are service-connected, that I was

11:45.162 --> 12:04.647
able to get a $10,000 life insurance, which I, as 
long as I I'm

12:05.437 --> 12:15.666
not employed, the government pays the premiums on 
this insurance. Would you rather see it more

12:15.686 --> 12:25.854
not national level but more personal level?

12:28.697 --> 12:29.638
How can you do that?

12:34.322 --> 12:34.802
It's been suggested that the VA system be phased 
out in favor of a program of insurance credits. And

12:45.140 --> 12:52.889
I don't know if you've heard about this or not, but I 
ran across it in the Ralph Nader report. Do you

12:52.909 --> 12:57.735
think this might be a better alternative than the 
present VA system? No, I think it would be worse.

13:00.719 --> 13:01.279
Why is that? Well, because Well, I understand 
under that, that would be fall under Medicare. And

13:09.812 --> 13:20.345
then, like, when I go up for service-connected 
disabilities at the hospital, I don't have to pay

13:09.812 --> 13:20.345
any money for it whatsoever. But under Medicare, 
you do. You have a regular premium, you have

13:23.529 --> 13:32.380
deductible, and it only takes a certain amount of 
things and for a certain length of time. and say

13:33.119 --> 13:54.819
like I can only

13:33.119 --> 13:54.819
go up and have a certain number of appointments for 
a ailment, say like my stump that breaks down

13:33.119 --> 13:54.819
constantly and I have infections in it 
constantly. What

13:55.980 --> 14:01.405
Medicare plan is, that they take a average of all 
the people, and then they say, OK, the average is

14:01.638 --> 14:12.672
this, so you can have up to this. And that 
eliminates any individuality whatsoever, where

14:14.995 --> 14:31.155
my stump is constantly breaking down and with 
infections, but yet

14:14.995 --> 14:31.155
I get the same benefits I will be limited to my 
benefits when somebody else's would not break

14:32.114 --> 14:38.564
down whatsoever. So you feel the VA is more of a 
personal type of thing? Well, I wouldn't say yes

14:45.796 --> 14:59.438
would be much more personal than what Medicare and 
their Social Security would be or a program like

14:45.796 --> 14:59.438
that. And what is even more personal is your 
military hospitals, which I have access to right

14:59.755 --> 15:09.066
now also. So here in San Antonio, I have three large 
hospitals. I can go for medical care free right

15:13.491 --> 15:17.535
now. Can't beat

15:17.936 --> 15:24.243
that. It's 15 years now to society. How do you feel 
about the rest of society in general? I've read

15:35.896 --> 15:40.963
where a lot of Vietnam veterans have differing 
views. Well, I think that's the same with any

15:43.047 --> 15:51.820
cross-section of the American population. I've 
read where a lot of people are cynical. Do you ever

15:59.138 --> 16:06.006
feel any cynicism towards the society at all?

16:07.368 --> 16:23.508
No, but I think there's a lot of truth in it that I've 
heard a lot of veterans say that when they apply for

16:07.368 --> 16:23.508
a job that they can't get because they're a Vietnam 
veteran. Now whether this is true or not, I don't

16:23.528 --> 16:27.913
know.

16:29.547 --> 16:41.741
Besides the obvious adjustments you had to make, 
what sort of changes did you notice when you got

16:29.547 --> 16:41.741
back from Vietnam? Well, I had to change my whole 
lifestyle because I was a very avid skier, racer,

16:41.761 --> 16:59.082
mountain climbing, and I used to skydive and so on. 
my whole outlook I had to change. I had to make a

17:04.324 --> 17:10.215
complete change of lifestyle.

17:11.738 --> 17:19.652
What did you find helped you the most in helping you 
cope with your disability?

17:28.981 --> 17:36.068
I don't know, I guess it's just like I said before, 
it's either inbred or it's not.

17:37.029 --> 17:38.570
Just a will to go on. How did, do you think, what was 
the effect of the Army on you? Did the service

17:46.278 --> 17:48.600
change you in any way? No, I don't think so.

17:56.099 --> 18:01.827
How has war, just war itself, changed your outlook 
on life, or has it? Well, I don't go hunting

18:04.451 --> 18:06.314
anymore. I used to like to hunt. Maybe I have some 
part of a feeling of what it's like to be shot at.

18:19.953 --> 18:24.520
It changes your outlook that way. In the late 
1960s, these are all just a lot of little general

18:24.972 --> 18:33.363
questions that I just had and couldn't, found 
trouble fitting them in. In the late 1960s, a lot

18:34.204 --> 18:46.341
of, mostly the youth, college students and 
whatnot, started opposing our involvement in the

18:34.204 --> 18:46.341
Vietnam War. What was your feelings towards the 
protest movements? I think they have a right to

18:53.103 --> 19:07.275
protest, but I don't think they have a right to 
infringe on the other person's freedoms under the

18:53.103 --> 19:07.275
Constitution. And I think they were doing this. 
Were you ever confronted by any of the Vietnam

19:11.338 --> 19:18.724
veterans against the war organizations at all? 
No, I've stayed clear. Like normally, your normal

19:23.562 --> 19:48.608
veterans organizations such as your VFW and 
American Legion, I don't normally approve of them

19:23.562 --> 19:48.608
because the only thing they are is a place where 
they'll get drunk, the way I feel. And that's not

19:48.929 --> 19:53.113
the right way of doing things. You had mentioned 
that you're in the Special Forces organization in

19:53.532 --> 19:58.339
this Alamo chapter. Talk a little bit about that. 
What is the objectives of this organization? To be

20:05.651 --> 20:21.936
of service to the community and to bring people 
together who had the same camaraderie during the

20:05.651 --> 20:21.936
war.

20:22.220 --> 20:25.784
We are active in that. We're trying to become 
active in a volunteer program up at the VA

20:26.505 --> 20:34.333
hospital. And we have set up a scholarship fund for

20:35.254 --> 20:51.332
children of the special forces or the ones who died 
in Vietnam. to help them through, we're trying to

20:51.667 --> 20:57.953
set up a scholarship fund for that. And we believe 
in the American way, Constitution, and you might

20:58.794 --> 21:18.012
say we're more a military-like organization 
that, like on the veterans parades and so on, we try

20:58.794 --> 21:18.012
to participate in, and we do this quite a bit. Have 
you found in your community services, have you

21:18.548 --> 21:25.456
found that the community has been receptive? 
Well, we aren't big enough yet to really find out,

21:26.838 --> 21:38.993
but I feel what little feedback we have is that it's 
very positive. That's great. Now, one thing

21:40.274 --> 21:46.902
coming up in, I believe, October, we're going to 
have 5K runs. Fort Sam, and we're throwing a little

21:47.489 --> 21:52.615
extra twist in it. For the people who want to, they 
can go through a pretty good obstacle course with

21:55.438 --> 22:01.385
the run. Oh, gosh. Test your endurance. You're 
right. How are you all funded, basically? From

22:12.357 --> 22:12.938
news. So you all don't get any really outside help 
at all? No. The dues and gifts from different

22:19.677 --> 22:23.481
people. I have two last questions, and they're 
very personal questions.

22:34.671 --> 22:41.778
Do you feel, looking back at it now, was the Vietnam 
War worthwhile to you? Yes.

22:47.615 --> 22:54.044
tensions mounting up in Central America and the 
Middle East and abroad. What is your opinion of war

22:55.086 --> 22:59.872
itself? Well, I believe that we should defend our 
country and our allies. That's all the questions I

23:10.087 --> 23:15.114
have and I really thank you a lot. You've been a 
tremendous inspiration to me and I think anybody

23:16.066 --> 23:21.624
who you know and talk to. And in closing, I was 
wondering if there's anything you'd like to say.

23:26.320 --> 23:26.561
No. Thank you very much. You're welcome.
