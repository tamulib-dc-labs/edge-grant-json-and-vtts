WEBVTT

00:06.308 --> 00:06.728
All right, sir. And the next question, could you 
talk more about your views on the enemy?

00:16.460 --> 00:19.624
Well, surely.

00:23.729 --> 00:27.093
I did not hate the North Vietnamese. I remember 
when I first came into the Marine Corps, the first

00:27.113 --> 00:35.843
argument I had, I despised the Japanese. His 
brother had been a Marine in the Second World War

00:36.869 --> 00:45.179
and had been killed.

00:45.199 --> 00:46.861
And he hated the Japanese as a race.

00:49.905 --> 00:55.251
I didn't feel that hatred toward North 
Vietnamese. I knew that they were the opponents,

00:55.271 --> 00:58.095
the enemy, or the aggressors. And I had a job to do to 
go out there and fight and win.

01:04.903 --> 01:05.644
But I never got into a position or a situation which 
caused me to hate them as a race or as a foreign

01:06.181 --> 01:12.731
country. I didn't like them as a foreign country. 
Propaganda against them was such that they were

01:16.658 --> 01:20.303
the aggressors. They were trying to take over 
another country. I think most Americans, and I am

01:24.270 --> 01:30.079
surely one, who supported underdogs. and like to 
support a cause like that. So from that aspect, I

01:34.750 --> 01:44.102
thought the North Vietnamese

01:34.750 --> 01:44.102
were wrong in trying to go down and take over South 
Vietnam. I didn't agree with the way the North

01:44.122 --> 01:47.626
Vietnamese lived. In other words, they did not 
have a democracy. South Vietnam had a democracy,

01:50.110 --> 01:56.438
although there was a lot of corruption that goes 
on. There's corruption everywhere. But by and

01:57.799 --> 01:59.762
large, I think they had a democracy. I also believe 
in the domino theory that if Vietnam fell, then

02:00.637 --> 02:17.532
other countries around them would fall, finally 
until you get down to Malaysia and to the Malaccan

02:00.637 --> 02:17.532
Straits and cut off shipping halfway around the 
world at that point. And we're seeing that to some

02:18.625 --> 02:21.028
degree now. There's not a timetable for the domino 
period. But Cambodia is gone. Thailand's in

02:25.594 --> 02:27.397
trouble. Laos is in trouble. So we've just seen the 
domino effect of the country starting to fall

02:30.220 --> 02:44.539
there on

02:30.220 --> 02:44.539
the realm of Asia. All right, sir. Concerning 
the... if you will, the individualism of the war,

02:49.237 --> 02:52.881
the one-year tours. Do you believe that, or could 
you just talk about that, concerning having the

02:53.582 --> 03:09.198
one-year tours versus having units go over to a war 
together, doing whatever they're going to,

02:53.582 --> 03:09.198
whatever operations, and then coming back as a 
unit? Okay. Versus going over and staying over

03:11.861 --> 03:16.566
also, or just rotating people as opposed to units. 
Yes, sir. I

03:19.763 --> 03:35.985
don't know of a better way, another way to make it 
work other than rotating

03:19.763 --> 03:35.985
people. Ideally, in a perfect world, we would like 
to have a combat unit that's had all of its people in

03:36.005 --> 03:41.873
there. for a reasonable length of time so that that 
unit is well trained. You can pick it up, send it to a

03:46.581 --> 03:50.205
combat zone, and fight.

03:53.890 --> 04:04.483
And then at the end of its assigned tour, you can 
pick them up, take another unit, and put them there

03:53.890 --> 04:04.483
in their place to continue the war effort. You have 
several problems, and they're massive problems.

04:08.408 --> 04:12.754
First of all, when you take a unit and plop it into a 
country like that, into a war zone, probably

04:14.168 --> 04:22.659
inexperienced in the nature of that particular 
war. And it takes them a while to come up to speed.

04:27.745 --> 04:35.034
For instance, we brought a regiment, put together 
a regiment in Vietnam, and brought them in. We

04:35.054 --> 04:42.403
created a regiment of 27 Marines in California and 
brought them over to Vietnam. and they were to take

04:43.447 --> 04:52.338
over a certain sector in the 1st Marine Division 
Zone of Action. There was so much apprehension at

04:52.358 --> 05:13.285
the senior command level about their 
survivability that they had a two- or three-week

04:52.358 --> 05:13.285
training period with the 1st Marine Division 
units that were in there to learn about the booby

04:52.358 --> 05:13.285
traps, to learn how to fight in the jungle and to 
eat. And they took a lot of casualties after they

05:13.467 --> 05:15.749
first got there. After they were cut loose, we 
actually had people nearly holding their hands

05:15.770 --> 05:23.518
for two or three weeks. And when that development 
part was cut loose, they suffered high casualties

05:23.538 --> 05:31.507
until they became combat savvy.

05:34.910 --> 05:40.977
The next problem is that when you have a war and 
you're expanding your forces, First of all,

05:42.357 --> 05:52.147
you're having casualties of the units in the 
combat zone, and you've got to replace those at the

05:42.357 --> 05:52.147
same time to be trying to build these new units and 
then get them trained. I'll tell you, it takes a

05:53.268 --> 05:55.650
long time to train a combat unit. And if you're 
starting with all fresh people with no corporate

05:56.531 --> 06:04.359
knowledge, then that's extremely difficult. And 
your personnel flow, your manpower flow, just

06:04.379 --> 06:11.166
barely prevents you from creating new units maybe 
50% combat veterans and the rest inexperienced

06:11.686 --> 06:21.860
soldiers and sending them off to combat.

06:21.880 --> 06:32.856
On the other hand, the individual rotation is 
difficult because you never have a combat

06:21.880 --> 06:32.856
organization that is a well-trained, well-oiled 
machine. You've got people coming in weekly.

06:38.213 --> 06:45.758
effectiveness is down to that lowest common 
denominator, that new person, until he gets some

06:38.213 --> 06:45.758
experience and some training. On the other hand, 
it's better for, let's say, an infantry company

06:45.778 --> 06:51.717
that might have 150 people It's far better to have 
only 10 or 15 of those that are in the training

06:52.152 --> 06:57.441
process and are in experience. That's 10% as 
opposed to a big unit, 100% in experience. That's

07:03.892 --> 07:10.744
where you can have a lot of serious

07:03.892 --> 07:10.744
mistakes and have a lot of casualties. I would have 
preferred

07:10.764 --> 07:17.856
to go over with a unit that was full strength And all 
of its equipment, people were well trained. But I

07:21.830 --> 07:26.215
think that will only work if you first go into a 
combat. After that, the follow-on units are just

07:26.235 --> 07:29.820
too hard to put together. In the ideal situation, 
if everything were perfect, if you had everything

07:29.840 --> 07:37.249
that you needed, that would be a great way to go to 
war. You would know all the people. You would know

07:39.912 --> 07:44.718
how dependable the man on your right is, the man on 
your left is. Practice. All right, sir. Did you

07:48.920 --> 07:50.242
notice any differences? I guess first, if you 
could talk some more about your experience in

07:50.743 --> 07:57.252
Vietnam in 1963 when you first went there doing the 
hydro surveys. Did you have any contact with the

07:57.452 --> 08:04.342
enemy or anything

07:57.452 --> 08:04.342
other than just doing the hydro surveys? We had 
contact with the enemy on several occasions. As I

08:11.392 --> 08:14.556
say, the war had been going on in Vietnam for a long 
time. We got ambushed a couple of times. We were not

08:19.153 --> 08:23.918
on seek and destroy missions. We were strictly 
doing reconnaissance missions. But we got

08:27.442 --> 08:33.548
ambushed a couple of times, got pinned down in as 
much as eight hours. So there was a full-fledged

08:33.568 --> 08:35.290
war going on. It was a war between the North 
Vietnamese and the South Vietnamese. We just

08:40.596 --> 08:41.657
happened to get in the way a couple of times. And did 
you see any differences in the way, I guess in the

08:42.599 --> 08:52.152
overall context, the way the war was being fought 
in 63 versus 68? I really can't comment on that

08:53.454 --> 09:03.227
because I wasn't in there in a position to have 
first-hand knowledge of that. Ours were all

09:03.247 --> 09:08.775
meeting engagements where we walked into 
something, got in the middle of something, We

09:09.481 --> 09:12.083
operated off the ship every night. We'd go in in the 
morning and come out at night. So I was not there

09:15.146 --> 09:17.048
permanently. We did not have an opportunity to 
observe it through our system. All right, sir. Do

09:22.072 --> 09:29.099
you have any experience with the Marine PAC units 
or the program, the pacification? PAC or the CAP

09:29.439 --> 09:32.782
units, Combat Action Detentions? Yes, sir, the 
CAP units. We had some, and I think it was a very

09:33.603 --> 09:35.905
successful program. What we did was take Marines. 
We would set up a command organization or a command

09:39.603 --> 09:49.052
structure, and we would take a squad of Marines and 
put them in a village. And then they were there to

09:49.693 --> 09:52.896
teach the people how to defend themselves. They 
would dig fighting holes and trenches around

09:52.916 --> 09:55.839
their village. They would set up a reaction force 
to respond to critical areas. They had weapons. We

10:02.346 --> 10:04.648
taught them how to clean their weapons, how to fire 
them. and gave them the basic combat skills you

10:05.000 --> 10:11.207
need for defensive type warfare. It was also a good 
source of intelligence. We had, and it was really,

10:15.171 --> 10:26.623
it resulted in pacifying the various areas and it 
was very effective until we had to pull those

10:15.171 --> 10:26.623
organizations out. A lot of those squads or 
platoons that were involved in the combat action

10:26.643 --> 10:33.150
platoons, Got in some good scraps, good combat. 
The North Vietnamese or the Viet Cong learned how

10:36.926 --> 10:45.676
effective they were, and they went up on the hit 
list. Usually the intelligence was good enough

10:45.697 --> 10:50.602
that they could be reinforced and protected. 
Occasionally it was not, and we did not have an

10:50.622 --> 10:57.751
entire squad, but it was a very effective program. 
It was a dedicated bunch of Marines that were

10:57.771 --> 11:01.095
involved in that. And if you don't have enough 
military forces to actively patrol and cover an

11:02.071 --> 11:26.516
area, then I can't think of a better way to do it than 
to leave just little pockets of people in each one

11:02.071 --> 11:26.516
of the villages to bolster the local defenses 
there that those villages had and create a

11:02.071 --> 11:26.516
reporting chain where we could gather 
intelligence. All right, sir. And your views on

11:27.357 --> 11:29.780
the anti-war demonstrators? Didn't have any in 
Vietnam. You have to say back here in the States. Of

11:38.808 --> 11:48.580
course, I was going to graduate school after that, 
so I really wasn't particularly attuned to it.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.924
I'm trying to think back as to what my views were at 
that time.

11:57.891 --> 12:01.255
I thought they were un-American to start with. 
They were a country unified. that you ought to or

12:03.935 --> 12:06.499
ought to support the fight. And I guess that was my 
first awakening that how great the same could be.

12:12.046 --> 12:21.519
It's not popular, that

12:12.046 --> 12:21.519
people would rise up in arms against it. I think 
it's one thing to protest. It's another to be

12:23.242 --> 12:30.111
destructive, where they burned ROTC buildings on 
campuses. where they burned the flags and the

12:30.580 --> 12:33.365
draft boards. I recognize these are acts of 
symbolism. But to me, that's carrying

12:36.090 --> 12:41.559
it too far. When you

12:41.599 --> 12:52.137
carry it to the length that you appear to be 
anti-American, that's

12:41.599 --> 12:52.137
too far. I think Jane Fonda was wrong in going to the 
North Vietnamese Yes,

12:57.445 --> 13:01.269
sir. Your

13:01.289 --> 13:18.349
views

13:01.289 --> 13:18.349
on the Selective Service, the National Guard?

13:22.334 --> 13:26.018
Well, some people have had the view that there was 
such a waiting list to get into, say, like the

13:26.470 --> 13:34.200
National Guard because they would stay out of 
combat. And on the Selective Service, the draft,

13:35.121 --> 13:51.702
given the nature of Vietnam and the presidents 
that they deceived the American public and that

13:35.121 --> 13:51.702
they were pumping in Americans over to Vietnam 
through the use of the draft.

13:55.090 --> 13:56.832
Well, first of all, I believe in conscription. I 
think every American ought to serve his country,

13:57.372 --> 14:06.621
whether it's peacetime or

13:57.372 --> 14:06.621
war. I think that's been one of the strengths of 
this country. One of the problems that we are

14:12.167 --> 14:24.439
facing now and will become greater in the future is 
the fact that our politicians and our Congressmen

14:12.167 --> 14:24.439
lack military experience. a large portion of it 
goes to national defense. You can't have a strong

14:31.763 --> 14:36.331
country without a strong national defense. And 
we're getting to the point where the majority of

14:36.351 --> 14:48.351
congressmen have not served in the military, have 
not gained an appreciation and an understanding

14:36.351 --> 14:48.351
of what the militaries all have and what its roles 
and missions are. So from that point of view, I

14:48.371 --> 14:51.777
think conscription is good. as to whether or not it 
was effective during, whether the Selective

14:53.950 --> 15:00.199
Service was effective during Vietnam. In all, 
during all conflicts, you have exceptions to all

15:00.580 --> 15:05.447
rules. Waivers are given. This is where politics 
comes in, sprains are pulled. I'll get my son out of

15:10.495 --> 15:18.747
going, I think, into law school or into medical 
school or into college when he shouldn't be flying

15:10.495 --> 15:18.747
around. The system is designed for things like 
that. What the system is not designed for is

15:22.385 --> 15:31.819
professors giving people passing grades when 
they're funded, and that went on to a large extent.

15:31.839 --> 15:44.958
If you could get into college and you were at a 
liberal campus with good profs, you got grades,

15:31.839 --> 15:44.958
not necessarily an education, because those 
profs didn't support the war effort, and that was

15:31.839 --> 15:44.958
one person. If they could pass someone, though 
they may not have deserved it, there was one less

15:44.978 --> 15:51.868
person that could go support that war and support 
the country.

15:57.012 --> 15:58.814
I have no problem with the National Guard. They've 
only got so many openings to fill.

16:04.682 --> 16:06.584
The National Guard was not a problem. I don't think 
their ranks swole at all. You're always limited by

16:10.830 --> 16:14.174
a table of organization. If someone gets out, you 
can replace that person. I don't think the

16:17.318 --> 16:20.202
National Guard was a problem. Talk about Dan 
Quayle being able to get into the National Guard. I

16:24.793 --> 16:26.735
don't think a special opening was made for him. 
There were some openings that he was able to get

16:26.755 --> 16:32.181
into. All right, sir. Concerning the reserves, 
though, I don't know what the thrust of that

16:33.562 --> 16:49.800
question is, but I do know that a lot of active 
reserve units or people in active reserve units

16:33.562 --> 16:49.800
were disappointed that they were not called to 
war, not activated and ordered to war. When the

16:51.805 --> 17:06.307
President did not call up the reserves, a lot of 
those people

16:51.805 --> 17:06.307
left their reserve units and re-enlisted or came 
into the active Marine Corps

16:51.805 --> 17:06.307
to combat. All right, sir. You had said earlier 
that you had reopened Khe Sanh. Could you comment

17:13.078 --> 17:20.209
on that and also any particular feelings of 
reopening something that had once been occupied

17:20.729 --> 17:28.058
But, you know, it was giving, if you will, back to 
the enemy, but, like I say, going back to reopen it.

17:28.098 --> 17:29.339
No, no particular feelings. That was just another 
combat operation. It was a large one.

17:35.847 --> 17:44.077
To me, there was no emotional attachment to it or 
any symbolism to the fact that we'd occupied it. We

17:44.097 --> 17:45.959
lost a lot of people there. It was another 
objective of the combat operation.

17:52.032 --> 17:55.716
It was just another operation for me. It had some 
historical significance, but nothing other than

17:55.736 --> 18:00.582
that. All right, sir. Also, the last question, I 
guess it's a doozy, but your feelings of if and or

18:01.643 --> 18:14.399
how we could have won, or if you believe we did win. 
Militarily, we won the war. We won over there. We

18:18.003 --> 18:19.845
were controlling the countryside.

18:23.150 --> 18:30.798
through combat actions and then the fact that we 
were able to turn it over to pacification

18:23.150 --> 18:30.798
units. We had done our job

18:30.818 --> 18:36.625
in military. We did not win the war, though, 
because the country didn't support them. That's

18:41.290 --> 18:43.512
the difference. War is just one of those tools that 
politicians

18:43.532 --> 18:51.621
use in dealing with other countries.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.044
when we couldn't escalate anymore. And that was a 
political decision, not a military decision.

19:00.128 --> 19:01.029
We've served our purpose. We could have spent many 
more years there as an occupation force. That

19:07.278 --> 19:13.367
would have given the Vietnamese more time to 
stabilize and build their country. But they would

19:13.387 --> 19:21.118
have come to rely on us much more, because there's a 
lot of money that's spent on the military forces in

19:13.387 --> 19:21.118
there. You've got a lot of people in there. You're 
spending money. You're buying goods. You're

19:25.167 --> 19:26.830
building things. And I think we would have caused 
the Vietnamese to become dependent on us if

19:26.850 --> 19:35.483
we had stayed in there too long. But when we pulled 
out of Vietnam, we pulled out, I think, rather

19:35.503 --> 19:40.951
abruptly.

19:42.934 --> 19:44.997
We should have come out more slowly. probably made 
greater efforts to bolster the Vietnamese forces

19:45.837 --> 19:55.545
so that they could defend themselves and fight.

19:55.565 --> 20:06.254
But we've reached a point in America's history 
where there was zero sentiment

19:55.565 --> 20:06.254
for that part of the world and no support. And when 
the politicians cut off the first trains, you

20:06.274 --> 20:10.718
can't find them, so we had to pull out. That's what 
happened right there. There was a lack of support

20:11.418 --> 20:15.642
from the United States I'm of the school of thought 
that unless we get into the only war that we will be

20:16.077 --> 20:36.286
able to successfully fight, and be careful in how I 
say that, the only war that will have popular U.S.

20:16.077 --> 20:36.286
support will be a world war. Anything less than 
that will not. We have to commit forces to a combat

20:39.210 --> 20:44.177
zone. We need to go in there with sufficient forces 
to win within 30 days and be out within 90 days.

20:49.937 --> 20:56.367
Americans, as I indicated earlier, like to go in, 
get the job done, wipe their hands, and get out. And

20:56.387 --> 21:00.493
about a 90-day weather is all that allows. So we 
have to pick where we're going if we have to go

21:01.154 --> 21:05.421
anywhere. Go in there and actually do the job in 90 
days and take the next 60 days to get out and guard

21:05.441 --> 21:13.152
the location. After 90, I think we will see support 
of Americans waning, beginning to wane at 30 days.

21:26.028 --> 21:29.593
And at 90 days, it will be on a rapid decline where we 
are. And from that point on, we will not be able to

21:29.613 --> 21:35.381
fight

21:29.613 --> 21:35.381
a successful war. The only exception to that would 
be if we were attacked in the case of a world war

21:35.401 --> 21:41.890
where we have mobilization where everyone is 
involved, everyone's life is touched, then you

21:43.979 --> 21:54.740
may have the ideal support of most people, not all 
people. That's the only exception. That's a sad

21:55.301 --> 21:58.447
commentary, but that's the way Americans are made 
up. We're industrious. And that's why we like,

22:02.288 --> 22:08.779
because we're an industrial nation, we like to see 
things happen quickly. You see it in business, you

22:08.799 --> 22:11.984
see it in how we conduct our affairs. You want to go 
in and talk to a lawyer and get your business done

22:12.685 --> 22:16.091
and get out. You want to start a company, you want to 
make a lot of money, you just hate the routine daily

22:16.612 --> 22:21.079
grind.

22:24.044 --> 22:25.647
And it reflects in the support of the war. All 
right, sir. Well, I appreciate you giving me this

22:28.087 --> 22:33.156
time for this interview, and that concludes the 
interview.
