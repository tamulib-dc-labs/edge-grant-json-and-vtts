This is side four. This is side four. This is side 
four. Continuing the discussion of crossroads.

00:27.571 --> 00:41.491
They plan to measure the immediate and long-range 
effects of the burst upon fish population of

00:27.571 --> 00:41.491
Bikini Atoll and the rate of repopulation through 
reproduction and immigration of the fish

00:27.571 --> 00:41.491
populations destroyed. Since early planning 
indicated that the ecological phase of the future

00:43.594 --> 00:55.350
study of Bikini Atoll and surrounding waters was 
an important one, the primary responsibility for

00:43.594 --> 00:55.350
the biological survey rested with the U.S. 
National Museum. The plans for the biological

00:55.617 --> 01:05.614
survey call for a quantitative inventory of flora 
and fauna at Bikini at any weak dock which would

00:55.617 --> 01:05.614
feel only moderate effects and at Rongerik not 
likely to be affected at all. These inventories

01:05.914 --> 01:15.450
were to be made prior to the burst as soon 
afterwards as possible and at varying intervals

01:05.914 --> 01:15.450
for a considerable period to estimate long period 
effects and the rate of repopulation. Three

01:16.512 --> 01:20.038
geologists from the geological survey were 
specifically selected. to study bottom

01:20.018 --> 01:31.488
sediments using both bottom sampling and 
photographic methods, and to investigate the

01:20.018 --> 01:31.488
physiography and geology of the islands of the 
Bikini Atoll, the shore and beach processes, and

01:20.018 --> 01:31.488
the ecology of the coral reefs. The purpose of the 
geological investigation was to study possible

01:32.349 --> 01:48.203
effects of the explosion, like erosion of the 
interface of Bikini Island by waves and currents,

01:32.349 --> 01:48.203
changes in bottom topography by transportation 
of sediment near the explosion, and radioactive

01:32.349 --> 01:48.203
effects on the bottom sediments in the coral reef. 
On 11 March, the Bautist expedition composed of

01:48.183 --> 01:55.543
these advanced study activities began their 
scientific work in Bikini Lagoon.

01:58.240 --> 02:13.920
In the latter part of December, wave measurements 
were among the topics of discussion in a

01:58.240 --> 02:13.920
conference called by the Bureau of Ordnance, 
which was attended by Rail Admiral, then

01:58.240 --> 02:13.920
Commodore Parsons, Rail Admiral Sahlberg, and 
representatives of the Bureau of Ships of the

01:58.240 --> 02:13.920
Manhattan District and the Los Alamos 
Laboratories. The Alamos representatives

02:14.440 --> 02:25.935
particularly emphasized the importance of wave 
measurements and called upon Commander Revell to

02:14.440 --> 02:25.935
describe the proposed methods of measurement, 
which included portable echo sounders and

02:14.440 --> 02:25.935
bottom-mounted echo sounders. Other work was 
done under the following people. Suggestions for

02:32.343 --> 02:42.655
wave measurement were received from Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institution, the Admiralty

02:32.343 --> 02:42.655
Research Laboratory in England, the University 
of California Division of War Research, and the

02:32.343 --> 02:42.655
U.S. Navy Electronics Laboratory. Suggestions 
from Mr. M.P. O'Brien, Dean of the University of

02:45.239 --> 02:50.505
California Department of Engineering, for full 
for model studies of wave generation,

02:50.907 --> 02:58.016
preliminary to the full-scale atomic studies, 
was subsequently carried out by his personnel and

02:50.907 --> 02:58.016
others. On page 383, photogrammetry and 
television, we've mentioned some of this. The

03:04.583 --> 03:12.493
head of the oceanography group recommended 
photogrammetry for wave measurements by means of

03:04.583 --> 03:12.493
simultaneous aerial and ground photography 
controlled by radio links. for the installation

03:12.558 --> 03:17.447
of camera towers on the Atoll Islands, as well as 
television observations. A special section of

03:18.469 --> 03:26.525
the group was organized for installing and 
operating two television transmitters on

03:18.469 --> 03:26.525
Bikini, two television receivers, and so forth. 
The group also arranged that a series of model

03:28.208 --> 03:35.342
tests be undertaken under the direction of 
Professor J. W. Johnson of Dean O'Brien's staff.

03:36.520 --> 03:50.843
The investigation was instituted at Woods Hole 
Laboratories, transferred to the Navy Taylor

03:36.520 --> 03:50.843
Model Base and finally to the Naval Warfare Mine 
Test Station, Solomons, as the size of the charges

03:36.520 --> 03:50.843
used in the investigation increased from one 
tenth of a pound to a thousand pounds.

03:55.790 --> 04:03.102
On page 396, it's worthwhile reading the 
conclusions

03:55.790 --> 04:03.102
as stated as follows. It seems that throughout the 
ages, each new weapon has been heralded as ringing

04:03.706 --> 04:08.973
the death knell of navies. Undoubtedly, this 
vicious cycle commenced with the introduction of

04:09.994 --> 04:19.067
cannons on galleys, which immediately outmoded 
the ore-propelled ram and thereby ended the reign

04:09.994 --> 04:19.067
of Sea Power. Whitehead's automotive torpedo 
assuredly placed the naval vessel in the

04:19.928 --> 04:25.095
proverbial mothballs. Sea Power then came to its 
end when Mr. Holland perfected the submarine, and

04:26.036 --> 04:31.924
again with the advent of the airplanes. but now it 
appears sea power which somehow not only managed

04:32.528 --> 04:41.412
to survive these other indefensible weapons but 
also managed to increase its influence is doomed

04:32.528 --> 04:41.412
once more. This time it is the atomic bomb that 
sends the navies to their inglorious grave. The

04:47.716 --> 05:03.158
student of history confesses that each new 
development, improvement, or invention has not

04:47.716 --> 05:03.158
diminished the naval vessel, but rather has 
expanded its importance, if not by utilization of

04:47.716 --> 05:03.158
that new invention to its own advantage, then by 
the development of defensive equipment or

04:47.716 --> 05:03.158
weapons which increased its power. Let us say, in 
general conclusion, that Operation Crossroads

05:07.038 --> 05:28.292
indicated that the destructive effect of the 
atomic bomb is 20,000 times greater than any other

05:07.038 --> 05:28.292
missile yet developed, which makes selectivity 
of targets impossible since non-military items

05:07.038 --> 05:28.292
will be destroyed just as surely as are the 
military objectives, that it can sink the largest

05:07.038 --> 05:28.292
ship afloat, and that the atomic bomb is a fact. 
This conclusion, however, has merely pointed the

05:30.494 --> 05:35.101
way for naval architects and strategists and 
tacticians. As the advent of air power only aided

05:35.863 --> 05:45.418
in making sea power stronger, so may this new 
weapon of warfare merely make naval force more

05:35.863 --> 05:45.418
effective. In page 396.

05:52.148 --> 05:58.138
On page 473, chapter 25 of this book, what is past is 
prologue. There's a summary that is worth reading

05:59.148 --> 06:01.811
into the record here. To study the future, one must 
first look to the past.

06:10.221 --> 06:20.633
This history then is a prologue of the Bureau of 
Ships, a record of wartime accomplishments

06:10.221 --> 06:20.633
almost unequal in scope, integration, and 
success of mission. According to the extensive

06:21.322 --> 06:43.937
data presented in the preceding chapters, the 
Bureau's functions in attaining these

06:21.322 --> 06:43.937
accomplishments during the fiery months from 7 
December 1941

06:21.322 --> 06:43.937
to 14 August 1945 fell into the categories of 
planning, production, and maintenance, which

06:21.322 --> 06:43.937
may well be recapitulated briefly to describe the 
background from which the future will emanate.

06:45.622 --> 06:51.432
One element of planning involved the efficacious 
allocation of over 20 billions of dollars during

06:45.622 --> 06:51.432
the war period. This sum went into the purchase of 
12 million tons of steel, an intake conservation

06:52.153 --> 07:11.005
of critical materials program which saved 30 
million pounds of nickel, 20 million pounds of

06:52.153 --> 07:11.005
rubber, 9 million pounds of tin, 207 million 
pounds of copper, and resulted in a considerable

06:52.153 --> 07:11.005
financial economy. It went into wages for some one 
million shipyard workers at the program's peak

07:11.356 --> 07:21.082
load, with over two million industrial workers 
being engaged in satellite industries at this

07:11.356 --> 07:21.082
same moment. Two million dollars were used to 
expand shipyards, and industrial plants to

07:26.797 --> 07:47.421
accommodate this comprehensive shipbuilding 
program involving over 40,000 contractors, and

07:26.797 --> 07:47.421
sizable appropriations were made to the Bureau of 
Ships' extensive training program, which

07:26.797 --> 07:47.421
involved 2,000 military and 4,000 civilian 
personnel, and to the elaborate design program

07:26.797 --> 07:47.421
involving 161 different types of vessels. 
Production was concerned with the construction

07:47.401 --> 08:13.932
of 1,141 combatant vessels, 75,113

07:47.401 --> 08:13.932
landing craft, 519 auxiliaries, which together 
with other types totaled 98,131

07:47.401 --> 08:13.932
vessels of 7,465,046 tonnage. produced during 
the war years. In addition, 1,504 ships totaling

08:16.645 --> 08:28.377
over four and one half million tons were 
converted, while almost 1,200 ships of one third

08:16.645 --> 08:28.377
million tonnage were acquired. Peak production 
for one month was reached in May 1944, when 4,475

08:29.487 --> 08:40.825
vessels and craft were constructed and 30 million 
diesel horsepower were installed. Compare this

08:41.746 --> 08:52.643
with the Navy on 7 December 1941, which included 
only 4,000 ships with 16 million steam and diesel

08:41.746 --> 08:52.643
horsepower. It is of interest to compare the 
following figures showing the building periods

08:53.416 --> 08:58.784
required for specific types of vessels. 
According to the maximum period, the average

08:59.565 --> 09:08.138
period, and the estimated average Japanese 
period, a conservative estimate must be accepted

08:59.565 --> 09:08.138
with reservation. Battleships maximum 46, 
average 36, Japanese 48. Destroyers maximum 30,

09:14.708 --> 09:18.714
average 12, Japanese 24. Submarines 27, average 
11, Japanese 12. LST, maximum nine, average

09:24.485 --> 09:27.550
three.

09:31.336 --> 09:32.437
These must be months.

09:35.903 --> 09:48.583
Electronics production proved almost as 
spectacular with the manufacture of 35,617

09:35.903 --> 09:48.583
radar, radio, and sound equipment during the war 
years, plus 10,225 units for the Marine Corps.

09:49.508 --> 09:59.232
Maintenance involved the production of varying 
quantities of over 2,500,000 individual service

09:49.508 --> 09:59.232
parts requiring 227 acres of warehousing. 
Although repair and overhaul estimates are

09:59.600 --> 10:08.371
impossible to bring under a common denominator, 
it may be roughly estimated that over 20,000 ships

09:59.600 --> 10:08.371
were serviced each year. Over 500 calls for 
salvage were answered, resulting in the saving of

10:09.272 --> 10:15.661
$700 million worth of shipping. Finally, the 
vital and important post-war program includes

10:16.442 --> 10:23.110
$20 million appropriate for the preservation of 
the reserve fleet. The principal objective and

10:25.773 --> 10:37.825
motivation for this study, however, is not to 
eulogize the accomplishment of the personnel of

10:25.773 --> 10:37.825
the Bureau, rather it is to gather up a summary of 
past experience from which data may be drawn as a

10:25.773 --> 10:37.825
basis in the formulation of future plans. It makes 
several general considerations, which I need not

10:39.026 --> 10:54.362
go into here, but are worth reading, and the book 
itself is far from negligible, and I will repeat

10:39.026 --> 10:54.362
its title. An administrative history of the 
Bureau of Ships during World War II, Volume 4.

11:00.505 --> 11:05.193
First draft narrative prepared by the historical 
section of the Bureau of Ships. End of this book

11:07.276 --> 11:13.305
report for the study at the first of this tape. 
Stop.

11:18.093 --> 11:19.675
After 1946,

11:21.747 --> 11:33.898
I went to Scripps Institution of Oceanography on a 
GI barrel and joined first class of physical

11:21.747 --> 11:33.898
oceanography graduate students. And I obtained a 
master's degree in 1948

11:35.059 --> 11:48.852
along with such persons as Bob Reed, John Cochran, 
Don Pritchard, Harry Carter, Dale Leper, in that

11:49.405 --> 11:54.471
group, most of whom went on to get their doctorate 
degrees.

11:57.595 --> 12:10.129
I went to the Hydrographic Office and got a job 
under Richard Fleming, R. H. Fleming, now retired

11:57.595 --> 12:10.129
as Department Head of Oceanography at the 
University of Seattle. Under him were a

12:11.671 --> 12:13.653
remarkable group of people. When I got there, John 
Lyman, now retired in Raleigh, North Carolina,

12:17.755 --> 12:22.540
was the assistant head of the section. Under him 
were Tommy Austin, Louie Allen, Charlie Bates,

12:23.621 --> 12:35.452
Jim Hughes, Boyd Olsen, A.R. Gordon, who 
graduated with me at Scripps, and others like Ben

12:35.532 --> 12:46.463
Richman, Max McLean, Leighton Kohler, and many 
others. It is rather remarkable that so far as I

12:47.573 --> 12:55.668
know, Louie Allen, who passed away this past 
summer, is the first of this group to die. He was the

12:55.708 --> 13:07.590
well-known and beloved weather reporter for the 
station, I believe it was the CBS station, in

12:55.708 --> 13:07.590
Washington, D.C. but to his credit must be given 
the first attempt for ship routing using

13:09.140 --> 13:22.699
oceanographic and wave forecasts, a service 
which was later taken over by the Hydrographic

13:09.140 --> 13:22.699
Office itself. In the two to three years that I was 
with the Hydrographic Office, the outstanding

13:24.502 --> 13:33.595
accomplishment from my point of view was the 
establishment of the first converted Navy ships

13:34.182 --> 13:49.986
for oceanographic research, the San Pablo and 
another APA converted aircraft carrier,

13:34.182 --> 13:49.986
seaplane tender, a converted seaplane tender. It 
was our job to outfit these vessels which Tommy

13:51.729 --> 13:57.878
Austin then initiated as director of that group 
the first cruises which carried on and later were

13:58.567 --> 14:10.823
corroborated with the large multi-ship 
operations. These were among the first ships to be

14:10.843 --> 14:26.464
taken out of mothballs and put back into service 
after World War II for ships of any size, and it was a

14:10.843 --> 14:26.464
major effort between the Hydrographic Office and 
the Bureau of Ships. I felt much more at home at the

14:28.165 --> 14:55.135
Bureau of Ships, the Naval Oceanographic Office, 
and transferred over about 1951 and was

14:28.165 --> 14:55.135
immediately put in charge of taking care of the 
funding for the contracts for Woods Hole and

14:28.165 --> 14:55.135
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, working 
under Meredith D. Williams, Dick Williams.

14:57.916 --> 15:12.397
and Ned Shearer, who were in that department, 
later succeeded by E. Vernon Potter, PhD, as the

14:57.916 --> 15:12.397
oceanographic and scientific group in the sonar 
design section of Old Butte Ships. There were

15:13.539 --> 15:25.476
several important milestones to be considered 
between 1952 and 1969,

15:13.539 --> 15:25.476
which I consider to be the peak of the 
oceanographic effort in the Navy.

15:31.142 --> 15:55.125
The first was initiated by Gordon G. Lill, then 
head of the funding section at the Office of Naval

15:31.142 --> 15:55.125
Research, later succeeded by Arthur Maxwell,

15:31.142 --> 15:55.125
in which he, together with Arthur Maxwell and 
Phelan Jennings and Dick Vetter in that section,

15:31.142 --> 15:55.125
initiated the Informal Coordinating Conference 
of Oceanography, CCO. It soon became evident that

16:04.920 --> 16:19.425
we would have to broaden the base between BUSHPS 
and ONR, and the next people invited was Lionel K.

16:04.920 --> 16:19.425
Walford of the Bureau of Fisheries of the 
Department of Interior. This Informal

16:20.992 --> 16:37.332
Coordinating Committee

16:20.992 --> 16:37.332
of Oceanography

16:20.992 --> 16:37.332
grew finally to have some 19 activities under its 
scope. I think you will find it in Wink's book

16:37.352 --> 16:49.868
called The Politics of the Ocean, how this 
informal committee became important enough to

16:37.352 --> 16:49.868
get official recognition and the Interagency 
Committee on Oceanography was established,

16:50.371 --> 17:05.764
which became quite powerful up to the time when 
Wink became the secretary for the committee and

16:50.371 --> 17:05.764
commission directed by Hubert Humphrey in the 
latter days. Gordon Lill also developed the

17:07.280 --> 17:25.622
informal social group known as the American 
Miscellaneous Society, AMSOC, which originally

17:07.280 --> 17:25.622
was purely for social purposes but was later taken 
over as the activity that bid and helped design the

17:07.280 --> 17:25.622
Project Moho. I believe Gordon Lill had left and 
gone commercial for a while with the Submarine

17:27.404 --> 17:35.734
Signal Company, and Arthur Maxwell, was head of 
the department at ONR, where Phelan Jennings and

17:36.457 --> 17:46.051
Dick Vetter and he and others decided there should 
be a 10-year oceanographic plan. Eventually,

17:47.493 --> 17:51.199
there were two such plans succeeding each other. 
Due credit for the fact that the plan got off the

17:53.642 --> 18:04.778
ground at all should be given to Gilbert Maton, 
then with J.I. Thompson Company, who with his

18:06.764 --> 18:34.999
skill took the various opinions of King Cooper, 
Dick Better, Phelan Jennings and others and made a

18:06.764 --> 18:34.999
comprehensive report as to what our plan should be 
which was reasonable and which was the beginning

18:06.764 --> 18:34.999
of what became rather widespread overall 
planning for oceanography in the Navy program.

18:35.924 --> 18:41.251
which of course has ballooned since up into great 
organizations like NOAA. But in order to get

18:43.274 --> 18:56.012
funding, they saw that such a plan would have to be 
laid out and then approved by the then Assistant

18:43.274 --> 18:56.012
Secretary of the Navy, Jim Wakelin, and others in 
order to get going. It was very rough. but it was a

18:58.148 --> 19:06.999
beginning and was a milestone in the organization 
and planning for research and development in the

18:58.148 --> 19:06.999
Navy in oceanography. But I return to the informal 
coordinating committee on oceanography

19:08.240 --> 19:25.000
established by Lill as the first establishment of 
lines of communication between the different

19:08.240 --> 19:25.000
government agencies and the interplay of their 
work. such as on shipbuilding and ship

19:25.638 --> 19:46.409
construction, which included the Maritime 
Commission, the beginnings of the attempts to

19:25.638 --> 19:46.409
have a list of oceanographic instrumentation and 
some guidelines and standards for them, and

19:25.638 --> 19:46.409
multiple problems and great activities aiming 
for the same area.

19:48.932 --> 19:54.160
The 1950s were interesting and exciting years. 
There were enough old-timers left around in

19:55.388 --> 20:04.198
places of importance in the Bureau of Ships to be 
able to say, yes, we can do this. There were enough

20:05.980 --> 20:15.310
people with technical know-how and confidence 
based on the building of over a thousand ships and

20:05.980 --> 20:15.310
all of its parts to be able to say, yes, this can be 
done. And with enough imagination, and perhaps

20:16.611 --> 20:23.539
also due to the boredom of peacetime operations, A 
great deal of technical and managerial

20:24.852 --> 20:32.559
assistance was given on any project that captured 
their imagination. As one example, which came

20:34.741 --> 20:54.859
later, after Bob Dietz had given such a favorable 
report on Picard's Bathyscaphe, the Trieste, and

20:34.741 --> 20:54.859
after O&R had bought it, and after O&R had made the 
deep dive in the Marianas Trench with Don Walsh and

20:56.088 --> 21:04.937
Pickard with Andy Rechnitzer and Shoemaker with 
the other members of the team. The bathyscaphe was

21:06.278 --> 21:13.486
turned over, Trieste was turned over to the Bureau 
of Ships for future funding. It was too much, too

21:14.907 --> 21:20.713
big an item out of ONR's then just growing budget to 
be handled. And it was with surprise and delight

21:22.174 --> 21:25.858
that a captain off the cuff, as it were, said we will 
have $800,000 out of King's program for the

21:26.581 --> 21:34.591
Trieste. As simple as that.

21:39.196 --> 21:51.931
Furthermore, the contracting activities of the 
Bureau of Ships were used to dealing in millions of

21:39.196 --> 21:51.931
dollars and making decisions based on what they 
considered adequate information. And although

21:53.794 --> 21:55.896
in general principles the contractor with the 
lowest bid was given most consideration, there

21:57.327 --> 22:18.299
were certain areas in which the Bureau very wisely 
permitted sole source procurement, that is,

21:57.327 --> 22:18.299
procurement from a designated agent who was 
qualified to give the answers that were needed. On

22:19.541 --> 22:25.630
that basis, the Woods Holbrook was supported 
directly for many years from Bureau ships, plus

22:26.622 --> 22:50.905
O&R contracts also, but from the Bureau of Ships 
contract at least, we could cite all the way back

22:26.622 --> 22:50.905
the history of the development of the 
bathymograph as the reason for sole source

22:26.622 --> 22:50.905
procurement, in other words, buying the type of 
research from them which we specified in their

22:26.622 --> 22:50.905
program as approved and funded, to be funded for 
the year. The same was true of Lamont, And Ewing's

22:55.597 --> 23:08.896
work and the beautiful maps of Bruce Hazen were 
always prime number one exhibits, long before the

22:55.597 --> 23:08.896
Geographic brought them out, to show what we were 
learning about the bottom of the ocean. The same

23:10.418 --> 23:17.368
was true of Scripps, until Owen Awe took over the 
majority of that contract. My particular effort,

23:18.665 --> 23:30.178
which had some success, was the development of R&D 
programs in oceanography in the Navy Control

23:18.665 --> 23:30.178
Laboratories. It was always an interesting and 
fascinating problem to find a research project

23:31.940 --> 23:41.010
which fitted a particular man's capability in a 
laboratory, as well as a laboratory mission, and

23:41.767 --> 23:52.859
also in the development of oceanographic 
research. Sometimes it was easy. Out at the Navy

23:55.782 --> 24:06.053
Electronics Laboratory was a group interested in 
Arctic research with submarines under Dr. Waldo

23:55.782 --> 24:06.053
K. Lyon. And although we funded him many years for 
studies of sea ice and all that sort of thing too, we

24:07.315 --> 24:33.441
were always supported and delightfully 
supported by certain areas in the Chief of Naval

24:07.315 --> 24:33.441
Operations who knew, which we did not always know, 
that Dr. Lyon and his group were really laying the

24:07.315 --> 24:33.441
foundation for what later became the famous 
Nautilus cruise and the cruise of the under-ice

24:07.315 --> 24:33.441
submarines. But throughout all the years the 
major justification was the improvement of

24:35.463 --> 25:04.272
sonar, the lineal descendant of the original 
studies of afternoon effect and the Bathley

24:35.463 --> 25:04.272
thermograph, studies of internal waves, studies 
of bottom topography, the original

24:35.463 --> 25:04.272
installations of Ewing's three original SOFAR 
stations for sound fixing and navigation, at

25:04.775 --> 25:21.592
Point Arenas, I believe Point Sur, and Kaneohe, an 
unclassified system that operated for a while

25:04.775 --> 25:21.592
until the cables went out but proved the fact that 
it could be done. This little project upon which so

25:23.734 --> 25:33.043
much later work in the Navy hung should not be 
forgotten because with it, after the system was

25:23.734 --> 25:33.043
assessed, A small four-pound bomb of TNT 
hydrostatically fused to go off at the sound

25:33.985 --> 26:02.777
channel about 200 meters down or more could be 
heard at the three stations and a fix made of where

25:33.985 --> 26:02.777
it had occurred in the best portions of an ellipse 
six miles by a mile and a half wide, which was a

25:33.985 --> 26:02.777
pretty good location of any downed aircraft of 
those days. Had this system been maintained, the

26:07.303 --> 26:16.916
Navy could have saved far more than its original 
cost as it searched for airplanes lost in the

26:07.303 --> 26:16.916
Pacific. Even after the Port Arenas station went 
out, the link between Point Sour and Kaneohe was

26:18.639 --> 26:31.937
used for basic research in underwater sound for 
many years. At the risk of repetition, I have now

26:32.761 --> 26:43.756
found a part of an old speech which I want to read 
into the record as it points up some of the persons

26:32.761 --> 26:43.756
involved. These persons come under the names of 
Master Planners. Jim Wakelin and the Assistant

26:48.503 --> 26:53.510
Secretary of the Navy Establishment have already 
mentioned it. And now repeating a little bit.

26:58.546 --> 27:18.347
Master planners, the first one military man, for 
all this began in 1941 and 42, the late Rosson

26:58.546 --> 27:18.347
Bennett II, Railroad Mark, USN, one of MTS's first 
directors, and the Coal Pitchers Committee, the

26:58.546 --> 27:18.347
National Academy of Sciences, who said, go all out 
for oceanography if you want to improve

26:58.546 --> 27:18.347
underwater sound, so not performance. And 
through Bennett and his group would channel the

27:19.388 --> 27:23.592
funding and direction and and direction helped 
and given to the National Defense Research

27:24.635 --> 27:28.200
Committee. The fundings were in millions of 
dollars.

27:33.688 --> 27:41.879
From Woods Hole down to Washington came Columbus 
Islin, who has been honored recently in many

27:33.688 --> 27:41.879
speeches, and Morris Ewing. And from NIRL there 
was help, and from Scripps came H. Hughes-Feldrup

27:42.700 --> 27:49.550
and Walter Monk in the way of predictions. And 
right into the middle bench group came Roger

27:49.570 --> 27:52.414
Avell, You must see him with Marston Sargent as his 
first assistant, and Mary Sears, Dr. Mary Sears,

27:52.934 --> 28:06.334
now Woods Hole, who was then a wave out at the 
hydrographic office. And among the planners must

28:08.077 --> 28:14.586
be mentioned those starlets who emerged in the war 
or planning in the Navy laboratories. Some have

28:15.327 --> 28:17.811
left us, like it. Houghton and Guy Harris at New 
London, and at San Diego, Dr. Christensen and Don

28:17.943 --> 28:40.491
Wilson, and at Buschips, the original marine 
physical laboratory at Point Loma, where we had a

28:17.943 --> 28:40.491
series of powerful directors, Carl Eckert, Sir 
Charles Wright, Al Folk, and now later Fred Spies.

28:41.956 --> 28:45.480
Very few people know how much oceanography owes 
Roger Revelle. Suffice it to say that he

28:46.081 --> 28:52.808
implemented the contracts and was a prime mover in 
establishing ONR and our international posture.

28:53.930 --> 29:04.622
For 15 years, under one of his operational 
requirements, placed on the Bureau of Ships and

28:53.930 --> 29:04.622
ONR, one of the essential papers in the history of 
oceanography in the Navy. laid on equally on BUSH

29:05.530 --> 29:11.363
ships and ONR the job of continuing long-time 
research. In fact, in nine short sentences, he

29:12.104 --> 29:25.834
justified the Navy in doing any kind of work needed 
for marine research through the war and in the

29:12.104 --> 29:25.834
post-war years and later. An essential group in 
oceanography at this time in the early 50s was the

29:26.759 --> 29:36.269
Deepwater Propagation Committee back at Hersey 
as chairman. It had no schedule. It was a smoke

29:37.671 --> 29:45.539
filled room where review and decisions were made 
and the work carried out under the ONR and BUSHIP's

29:37.671 --> 29:45.539
contracts. At a typical meeting, say at Dobbs 
Ferry, the host would be Bob Frosch for Hudson

29:46.320 --> 29:53.728
Laboratories Al Berman, for Woods Hole, Al Vine, 
for Lamont, Joe Wazell, for Underwater Sound Lab,

29:53.962 --> 30:02.875
Guy Harris, for NEL, Gilbert Curl. Down to bishops 
came Alan Vine from Woods Hole also, for many terms

30:05.079 --> 30:10.727
of duty. In the 1950s, he joined Dick Williams, 
Vernon Potter, and Ned Shear, all under a crusty,

30:11.548 --> 30:22.264
fair-minded driver and assistant to Boston 
Bennett named George Cummings. Over at ONR was

30:23.088 --> 30:28.394
Gordon Lill and Art Maxwell, Don Martineau, 
Phenon Jennings. Lill started the original

30:29.236 --> 30:39.528
Coordinating Committee for Oceanography, which 
became the Interagency Committee on

30:29.236 --> 30:39.528
Oceanography with Bob Abel, and which had a 
crucial part in the Stratton Report. Dick Vetter

30:40.649 --> 30:47.678
left Lill's group at ONR to become secretary to 
Harrison Brown's National Committee for

30:40.649 --> 30:47.678
Oceanography. and kept it human with his reports 
called NASCO Notes and Doodles. Please continue

30:54.058 --> 30:56.047
