WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:21.785
Would

00:02.039 --> 00:21.785
you explain how you acquired your early interest 
in oceanography and your early academic

00:02.039 --> 00:21.785
training? Yeah, my early academic training was as 
an undergraduate in physics.

00:31.013 --> 00:39.145
The war came along, and I was teaching V-12 Navy 
students mathematics. I was also interested in

00:39.325 --> 00:47.176
graduate school in astronomy, and so I had a 
navigation course to teach. Now, where was this?

00:48.298 --> 00:54.106
Yeah, and the navigation course kind of got me 
interested in oceanography. I think that's

00:54.126 --> 00:55.768
basically it. Well, the first time I come in 
contact with your career, you were at Scripps. No,

00:59.262 --> 01:00.804
I was never at Scripps. You didn't go to Scripps and 
worked him in 40? No, I was in Scripps for the summer

01:05.609 --> 01:10.374
of 1949 once. Before that, I don't think I ever was 
at Scripps. My impression was that you appeared

01:14.519 --> 01:16.941
there briefly in 40. I suppose I got that from Roger 
Revelle. I think he's wrong. In 40, I don't think

01:20.105 --> 01:23.709
I... I certainly had never heard of oceanography 
before. I thought it was chemistry or something

01:26.852 --> 01:29.235
like that. And

01:29.806 --> 01:57.096
then I was looking around for something a little 
bit more active to do, and Lyman Spitzer, who was

01:29.806 --> 01:57.096
the professor of astrophysics at Yale, whom I'd 
known before Pearl Harbor, had gone to work in

01:29.806 --> 01:57.096
underwater sound work, and so he suggested I might 
come to Woods Hole. and that was 1944, and he,

01:58.088 --> 02:17.253
because I had already got this interest in 
navigation and so forth, it was quite an

01:58.088 --> 02:17.253
interesting opportunity for me to come to its own, 
see something firsthand about ships and work at

01:58.088 --> 02:17.253
sea and so forth. That was first working in a 
project for Morris Ewing, on the shallow

02:23.738 --> 02:28.425
thermoclines and the acoustic tracking on the 
upper layers. And I don't think I made out too well

02:30.247 --> 02:38.679
in that because the viewing somehow didn't 
communicate very well what it was he was doing. He

02:38.699 --> 02:40.621
was terribly busy. And after about six months of 
that, I think it was something like that, I started

02:40.641 --> 02:46.810
to work with Alan Vaughn, for Alan Vaughn. on 
constructing some new kinds of repeating smoke

02:47.752 --> 02:53.543
glass, battery thermo-grass. And I was working 
for him probably for a total of two years,

02:55.327 --> 03:05.727
something like that. and then started to work for 
Jeffries Wyman, who was a physiologist from

03:06.736 --> 03:18.028
Harvard who was working here on clouds, cumulus 
clouds.

03:21.532 --> 03:30.541
I think until I met Wyman, I had no idea about a 
scientific paper or how to really do any

03:21.532 --> 03:30.541
scientific research. Before that, it was being a 
technical assistant. And it was working with

03:33.702 --> 03:52.015
Wyman that gave me some idea about how you ask 
questions, and how you formulate models, and

03:33.702 --> 03:52.015
something about the scientific

03:33.702 --> 03:52.015
literature, which I didn't have any idea about 
before at all. That probably worked more or less in

03:52.055 --> 03:58.326
Wyman's projects up until 1947, probably. No, but 
when you were working with thermoclimes, you were

03:58.981 --> 04:05.168
working with any submarine warfare, is that 
right? Well, yes, that's what it was. For that

04:08.592 --> 04:19.844
first half year or a year, I guess, altogether, if 
you include the bath and thermograph stuff, maybe

04:08.592 --> 04:19.844
a year and a half. Then the world was over, and most 
of the people who were here A large number of them

04:25.677 --> 04:33.328
decided, I think, that there was really very 
little professional future in oceanography, and

04:25.677 --> 04:33.328
they all disappeared. Some went back to 
universities to teach basic subjects, and others

04:33.489 --> 04:47.950
went down to Navy laboratories in southern Spain, 
but only a very few stayed here, by comparison. I

04:48.090 --> 04:55.161
think 1949, 1950 was a low point in the population 
of the Asian Graffiti Institution. When did you

04:55.428 --> 05:00.095
first become interested in waves,

04:55.428 --> 05:00.095
though? Well, I guess I've never been interested 
in, very much, in surface waves. I was interested,

05:08.007 --> 05:19.585
the work I did that had anything to do with waves was 
very low frequency, raspy waves in the ocean. That

05:19.625 --> 05:24.152
was probably, I don't know, I think that was about 
1955, 57, something like that. And, but as far as

05:24.976 --> 05:48.099
surface waves are concerned, or internal waves, 
high frequency stuff, I really, I don't think I've

05:24.976 --> 05:48.099
ever written any paper at all, except one, a 
retracted paper that I wrote for a Russian journal

05:24.976 --> 05:48.099
called Duklady, 1950, I think it was. And after I 
discovered that the The paper had been, the

05:50.373 --> 05:55.959
material in the paper had really been worked out 
much earlier by Osmond Reynolds. I wrote a, sent a

05:56.039 --> 06:08.611
telegram to them asking them to either just to 
withdraw the paper or to,

05:56.039 --> 06:08.611
to destroy it. So it was a long period, then finally 
a telegram came from Mackey Radio, which said,

06:08.671 --> 06:20.143
which the secretary of the institution brought in 
rather tremblingly and said, Mr. Stommel, per

06:20.461 --> 06:24.645
your instructions, the papers have been 
destroyed. Krylov and Boguglia, something like

06:25.386 --> 06:27.428
that. Moscow. That was just the time of the 
McCarthy hearings and so forth, so we were kind of a

06:28.449 --> 06:38.860
little bit scared what was going to happen, but 
evidently it slipped through the CIA and FBI net.

06:38.880 --> 06:39.961
Never heard anything about it. They probably 
still have a file. I don't know. I think that

06:43.184 --> 06:44.445
they're not very efficient. I don't think they 
ever picked that one up. It never came up on any kind

06:46.647 --> 06:49.270
of... clearance or anything like that over the 
many years. What was Woods Hole like in those early

06:54.864 --> 06:57.088
years? Well, it was confined to that one building. 
When I first came here, there were German

07:00.553 --> 07:06.802
prisoners of war cleaning up after the 1944 
hurricane. And both of our ships, which were kind

07:06.822 --> 07:14.093
of small ships, the original Lattice and the 
Saluda, I think it was, were up the ground on Ram

07:14.630 --> 07:23.163
Island.

07:23.183 --> 07:23.884
And we pulled off. And everything was in that one 
building. There was quite a few small buildings on

07:26.307 --> 07:28.591
the docks. The heavy emphasis on explosive work, 
testing of different kinds of charges against

07:30.333 --> 07:41.890
model submarine hulls, that was a big problem. 
Because the Navy 7 was gone. And then there was the

07:46.034 --> 07:53.169
smaller acoustic program, which Ewing was 
carrying out mostly. And there were some

07:53.189 --> 08:05.815
biological programs about anti-fouling paint 
and about trying to reduce foam and see nine tubes

07:53.189 --> 08:05.815
in the wakes of landing craft when they were 
visible, things like that.

08:11.718 --> 08:21.131
where they got great big suitcases full of blue 
ration stamps to buy

08:11.718 --> 08:21.131
meat and all. It was a very different place than it 
is now. People were, although it was a very

08:24.856 --> 08:35.110
intense, dedicated activity in connection with 
war effort, and people were working there. long

08:35.917 --> 08:45.448
hours on the weekends and so forth, and I think 
there was an exceptionally high morale at the

08:35.917 --> 08:45.448
place at that time. The feeling of having to 
accomplish something every day. I think

08:51.336 --> 08:58.504
basically the level of industry perhaps twice 
what it is today. If you walk around in the relaxed

08:58.524 --> 09:05.873
atmosphere of our laboratory today, compared to 
the intense activity at that time, it was much,

08:58.524 --> 09:05.873
much harder work going on. Of course, we didn't 
have any large

09:08.688 --> 09:20.162
ships like the Atlantis, so we left the Atlantis 
too. Everything was reasonably uncomfortable on

09:20.182 --> 09:26.590
those little boats.

09:26.610 --> 09:27.972
Testing, one, two, three, testing. Testing, one, 
two, three, testing. Yeah. We were picking up some

09:32.638 --> 09:36.703
static someplace or what have you, but that's a lot 
better. How large was Woods Hole, Woods Hole

09:37.595 --> 09:41.501
roughly in terms of faculty then, I suppose? Well, 
is it on? Yes, on. When I,

09:48.552 --> 10:03.495
just after the people, just after the wartime when 
people had left, it was probably, it was probably

09:48.552 --> 10:03.495
very small. I don't know the number, but probably 
the total number of people was less than a hundred.

10:10.530 --> 10:18.826
And there were no, there was no tenure 
appointments or anything like that. There were a

10:18.846 --> 10:28.645
few people, maybe two or three, who had been 
granted some kind of long-term contract, but

10:18.846 --> 10:28.645
everybody else lived hand-to-mouth. The 
contracts, the grants were negotiated almost

10:29.401 --> 10:38.610
entirely by the director himself, so we didn't 
have to write proposals all the time. And we felt

10:38.630 --> 10:53.224
fairly, we felt reasonably secure, but being 25, 
28 or something like that, it's not a big concern

10:38.630 --> 10:53.224
if you're not married. And it was still operating 
very much in the style of a of a summer vacation

10:58.139 --> 11:10.738
laboratory with an increase of population in the 
summer of maybe doubled, something of that sort.

11:10.758 --> 11:24.940
So I would guess around 100, but maybe that's wrong 
and most of those people really, no retirement

11:10.758 --> 11:24.940
idea or any kind of commitment

11:10.758 --> 11:24.940
of any part of the institution at all.

11:27.653 --> 11:35.180
That took maybe eight or ten years to begin to take 
place. Now, people at Scripps seemed to think that

11:35.200 --> 11:52.955
there was more exchange among the faculty, more, 
dealt with wider varieties of ideas rather than a

11:35.200 --> 11:52.955
limited academic field in the 40s and the early 50s 
because of the closeness of the faculty, the size

11:35.200 --> 11:52.955
of the faculty. Was that your impression here at 
Woods

11:53.115 --> 11:57.559
Hole? You mean that there was more interchange 
between different physicists? Right.

12:03.914 --> 12:08.179
Biologists talked more to physicists who talked 
more to mathematicians or whatever. Oh, I think

12:08.200 --> 12:09.822
that's true. I think there was all being in one 
building and having a common tea in the afternoon.

12:22.237 --> 12:25.842
Always a lot of people from, there was only one tea. 
You go around a place like this, I suppose there

12:26.159 --> 12:32.547
must be 40 coffee pots in this institution today. I 
suppose, well, the coffee pots weren't running

12:32.567 --> 12:38.334
all day long, and there was one teapot in the 
afternoon. And that, I think, made people

12:38.715 --> 12:49.348
talk to each other about all that. And then there 
were lots of interdisciplinary cruises. ship

12:52.990 --> 13:02.000
time is a lot tighter than fewer ships, so people 
got accustomed to each other's work that way. I

13:03.642 --> 13:22.204
think the textbook by Spheredip Johnson and 
Fleming is rather indicative of the way that all

13:03.642 --> 13:22.204
the different aspects of oceanography are kind of 
lumped together in one curriculum or one group of

13:03.642 --> 13:22.204
people. I know. In my first days here, you see, in my 
first days, when it was just beginning, I had a

13:23.873 --> 13:38.568
smattering of work at Sea and Acoustics and 
instrumentability.

13:38.708 --> 13:43.793
I don't really match, but I had an expeditionary 
work in meteorology. And I worked for a little

13:43.813 --> 13:53.423
while, for a short time, with a biologist on, 
Gordon Riley, on plankton models. So I had an

13:53.842 --> 14:15.068
opportunity to play with meteorology, some 
elementary chemistry, and plankton ideas, and

13:53.842 --> 14:15.068
several aspects of oceanography, both in the 
field and theoretical sort of things, all in those

13:53.842 --> 14:15.068
first few years. But I think probably My fields of 
interest have narrowed quite a bit since that

14:21.044 --> 14:26.610
time. I don't do anything meteorology or biology. 
It's partly the nature of the field, but it's also

14:31.675 --> 14:43.226
partly living in next door offices with people 
working in other disciplines. This whole side of

14:43.787 --> 14:50.173
the building, for example, is all people 
connected with current meters, one way or

14:43.787 --> 14:50.173
another. I had to go upstairs to a chemist or down to 
the other laboratory to see instruments or ships.

14:58.842 --> 15:01.687
I don't even see ships out there. That's a 
noticeable change. Do you feel the stanalgia

15:06.556 --> 15:11.241
concerning the time when most oceanographers 
were journalists? No, I don't. I think the nature

15:12.662 --> 15:16.806
of science is much better now. I think science was 
very exploratory

15:17.387 --> 15:24.294
and thin. If you look at Sredip's book, you get an 
idea how thin it is. I think one has a nostalgia for

15:32.948 --> 15:59.043
any kind of thing to happen in the past, but it's not 
very strong in me, and I think that the

15:32.948 --> 15:59.043
sense of excitement and so forth is right now, this 
feeling that the science has developed into

15:32.948 --> 15:59.043
something interesting, something intricate 
enough that makes it interesting to people in

15:32.948 --> 15:59.043
other fields. We actually have in physical 
oceanography now a pretty good connection with

16:00.353 --> 16:23.998
people in hydrodynamics and fluid mechanical 
people, even to some degree with astrophysicists

16:00.353 --> 16:23.998
and astronomers, people who are interested in 
fluids on a large scale other than the Earth, and

16:00.353 --> 16:23.998
very good relations with meteorologists, more 
than we had before. The subject, the theoretical

16:26.527 --> 16:44.246
knowledge of the subject, the theoretical body of 
knowledge of the subject has grown

16:26.527 --> 16:44.246
tremendously from what it was in the 40s. There 
weren't any models, there weren't any ideas of how

16:44.546 --> 16:56.078
the ocean circulation went at that time, at least 
with the very rare exception of the Ekrem's model.

16:56.868 --> 17:02.982
which sat around sort of untouched

16:56.868 --> 17:02.982
for something like 50 years. Heckman wrote his 
spiral paper, I think in 1902 or maybe a little bit

17:03.623 --> 17:12.163
earlier. Publications in about 1902. He didn't 
actually go out and try to make any observations on

17:15.599 --> 17:18.565
it. He wrote some very interesting papers in 
between that are not very useful today. He didn't

17:24.456 --> 17:28.444
go out to look for it until 1932. And he didn't 
publish the results until 1954. He died in 1956.

17:35.326 --> 17:38.009
So, I think that's about the approximate dates. 
So, 52 years went between the time he wrote his

17:38.709 --> 17:51.204
theoretical paper and the time he wrote his 
analysis of an experimental results of the

17:38.709 --> 17:51.204
attempt to measure the spiral. The results 
weren't very good. I don't think the field could

17:53.332 --> 17:55.938
wait so long. It's

17:55.958 --> 18:04.337
amazing.

18:06.022 --> 18:18.434
in terms of grant getting in the late 40s and the 
early 50s, it seemed almost as if institutions

18:06.022 --> 18:18.434
received sort of block grants, particularly here 
at Lamont and Scripps, and sort of divided them up

18:06.022 --> 18:18.434
among the various researchers. Yeah, I think it 
wasn't really, yes, in effect it was like block

18:18.574 --> 18:31.287
grants, but it was grants to directors, people who 
had established a There were very, very few people

18:31.891 --> 18:50.136
established in the government's eyes as 
competition actors, and these people were people

18:31.891 --> 18:50.136
like Smith and Ravel and Hisler and Ewing, and so 
they made the major, they, it was, You could

18:51.415 --> 18:58.084
imagine a German institution where there's a 
chief professor who gets all the money and then

18:51.415 --> 18:58.084
hands it out and tells people what to do. Well, 
that's sort of the way it was here. The Islan got all

19:01.388 --> 19:06.554
the money and he handed it out. He never asked you to 
submit an estimated budget or anything like that.

19:13.403 --> 19:14.925
He did all of that. If you needed some money, you'd 
go and ask them, and generally it was worth coming.

19:21.131 --> 19:22.192
Ship time, the same way. You never knew whether you 
were going to have a ship or not. Someday, the whole

19:25.776 --> 19:39.732
ship scheduling procedure was in his head, and 
then he would come and say, you know, the advantage

19:25.776 --> 19:39.732
will be available for a month or two weeks from 
today. and we'd want to take her out, and that's the

19:40.505 --> 19:45.672
kind of preparation you would have on a cruise. Of 
course, you knew that that might happen, so you

19:46.293 --> 19:51.219
were a little bit prepared. But it was like that, 
largely through

19:51.239 --> 20:00.251
one person, the director. The institution was 
small, so it worked quite well, almost like a

20:00.271 --> 20:05.618
project leader or something. And, of course, he 
was an exceptionally nice man, and so it worked

20:06.526 --> 20:13.539
very well without any kinds of friction or 
unhappiness. People who were too big to live with a

20:14.801 --> 20:22.815
system like that, like Ewing, they just had to go 
start another laboratory somewhere else. They

20:22.835 --> 20:27.884
couldn't take it that way, that kind of patronage, 
and then they had to go somewhere else, and they

20:22.835 --> 20:27.884
did. They started off their own outfits quite 
nicely. The number of laboratories in this period

20:30.303 --> 20:38.554
seemed to increase by leaps and bounds, with 
Scripps and Woods Hole, of course, you know,

20:30.303 --> 20:38.554
leading the way. But, gee, Washington, Oregon 
State almost begins a few years later. Yes, but I

20:43.841 --> 20:47.105
think the, I don't, I don't, that's interesting. I 
don't know that the number of institutions grew

20:47.205 --> 20:51.671
very fast. I don't, it'd be interesting to know 
what the, how it went, but I think that they

20:52.873 --> 20:57.559
probably There was a famous, well, after the war, 
several years went by and oceanography was kind of

20:57.944 --> 21:22.787
a low end, and then in the National Academy of 
Sciences there was a report put together, I think

20:57.944 --> 21:22.787
mostly under Harrison Brown, perhaps it was an 
earlier one, and this had the This woke a lot of

21:23.341 --> 21:24.903
people. This broke loose some money. A

21:27.487 --> 21:36.001
lot of places started to, at that time, began to 
start to set up institutions. Seattle had been

21:36.982 --> 21:48.460
going for a long time,

21:36.982 --> 21:48.460
probably before Woods Hole, on a very small

21:36.982 --> 21:48.460
basis. But I think places, I don't know, I think 
places like Texas A&M and Oregon State and

21:50.037 --> 22:03.869
University of Miami and so forth really sort of 
began to start in the mid-50s, I think. I don't

22:04.150 --> 22:07.573
believe earlier than that. I think that's right. I 
think so. And I think it was part and parcel of that

22:09.935 --> 22:19.403
initiative which the Academy had taken in trying 
to make this field more visible. I think it was the

22:20.311 --> 22:21.334
mid-50s. And then the big flux of students began in 
the early 60s, mid-60s. That's when the students,

22:29.439 --> 22:34.354
when the educational programs began to get set up. 
good students began to appear in the early 60s, but

22:34.857 --> 22:51.478
a whole new generation began to appear as a result 
of all these different places where they set up

22:34.857 --> 22:51.478
their educational institutions. That's when the 
new PhDs began to appear, but very few in 59 and 60.

22:57.465 --> 23:03.733
There was a noticeable low period, I think, from 
1948 to 1955, 56,

23:04.034 --> 23:07.578
This would be roughly in the period when the ONR was 
your major funder. Yes, it was. They kept the whole

23:09.420 --> 23:12.664
thing alive for a long time. Did it seem to you they 
were more interested then in research and

23:13.826 --> 23:18.351
development than mission orientation? Oh, yeah, 
they were much more. The ONR was extremely

23:21.395 --> 23:28.764
generous about letting you do more or less 
anything you wanted to do. It would be called

23:28.824 --> 23:32.348
military oceanography, but it wasn't military 
oceanography. It could be tracking the Gulf

23:32.368 --> 23:33.990
Stream or tracking surface loads drifting 
around. Just listening. ONR never really asked if

23:40.204 --> 23:48.638
there was any need to justify things on the basis of 
social needs or military needs. That never

23:48.738 --> 23:54.127
filtered down, as far as I know, in that period, 
1948 to 1950s. It never filtered down to the

23:54.147 --> 23:57.332
individual investigators. Maybe the directors 
had to cut some lines, but the individual

23:57.352 --> 24:00.838
investigators never had to. So you didn't seem to 
have any problem having your projects funded? No,

24:05.738 --> 24:13.296
of course we were satisfied with very modest 
funding. We're happy to have them. happy to have

24:16.394 --> 24:19.499
salaries of around $3,000 a year. And if we had a 
budget,

24:20.281 --> 24:37.269
if we were going to buy some equipment and so forth, 
and the budget came for something like $20,000

24:20.281 --> 24:37.269
over a year, it couldn't be regarded as a very big 
thing. So I'd rather have it long. How large

24:41.200 --> 24:58.406
was the first grant you received? That's a good 
question. I got grant money from ISM.

25:08.318 --> 25:13.445
When did I try to, when did I first try to stand on my 
own feet and write a grant? That's an interesting

25:13.465 --> 25:15.648
question.

25:20.715 --> 25:33.212
Probably,

25:20.715 --> 25:33.212
probably around 1951 or 1952, I got some grant from

25:38.153 --> 25:39.295
There were two grants. One was from the Atomic 
Energy Commission for internal wave monitoring

25:39.355 --> 25:46.987
thing off the river. The other was

25:47.007 --> 26:01.950
from a special code in ONR, which I don't remember 
what the name of the code ONR was, Naval Research

25:47.007 --> 26:01.950
Code, for making some studies of the infrared 
noise from the C-cells. And

26:10.345 --> 26:25.364
those two things basically, I guess, eventually 
led to the establishment of the Panularis station

26:10.345 --> 26:25.364
data at Bermuda. That was the material wave that 
led to that. going to lead to internal waste

26:28.863 --> 26:43.779
because

26:28.863 --> 26:43.779
we found that, oh, I remember, we told the AEC we 
were going to make pressure measurements on the

26:28.863 --> 26:43.779
slope of the river. It turned out that we were 
unable to do that, so we made temperature

26:43.799 --> 26:56.473
measurements instead, and then wrote out those 
results as internal weight measurements. We

26:56.493 --> 26:58.735
really didn't use all the cable they gave us. But 
the, and then that eventually led to the Panoleros

26:59.272 --> 27:20.103
stations at Bermuda, but the infrared thing began 
to be quite a burden and so we asked, we found Bill

26:59.272 --> 27:20.103
Richardson who was working at the Patel Institute 
or something like that to come and take that

26:59.272 --> 27:20.103
project over. And for some years we were flying 
infrared detectors around the Gulf, over the Gulf

27:20.123 --> 27:24.870
Stream. It never became a very a very useful tool 
for industrial studies, but it was the one we tried

27:27.014 --> 27:35.025
to make work. I guess 1951, 1952, those were 
probably the first distinct projects that I got

27:35.145 --> 27:54.692
separate from working under the resistance 
programs, because I know certainly in 1953 and

27:35.145 --> 27:54.692
1954, I was trying to do some other work under the 
Morani resistance program.

27:56.663 --> 28:14.680
Of course, I suppose really the time that I would 
know, the time that I would actually know I was

27:56.663 --> 28:14.680
writing my own proposals was certainly when I 
started over at Harvard in 1960, then, because

27:56.663 --> 28:14.680
then there wasn't any sheltering in the internal 
environment. And it was probably before that. But

28:18.965 --> 28:22.468
you're a relatively well-known oceanographer by 
1951. Well, yeah, but it was a very small field and I

28:24.119 --> 28:41.323
didn't have any great urge to build an empire or to 
get out from under Islam or anything like that. It

28:41.483 --> 28:46.129
was quite a comfortable, nice setup for me. I'd 
forgotten when he gave up being the director and

28:46.149 --> 28:50.295
Admiral Smith came in. But his was still around and 
still, I think, understood the military

28:50.917 --> 29:03.428
oceanography

28:50.917 --> 29:03.428
program for quite some time. When did you first 
meet Walter Munk? Well, that's an interesting

29:06.791 --> 29:08.493
question.

29:15.179 --> 29:20.704
I might have met him before 1949, but I think I met 
him during the summer of 1949 is when I first met

29:15.179 --> 29:20.704
him. I went out to Scripps, and I had just done my 
little Gulf Stream model, I mean ocean model, and I

29:21.393 --> 29:47.226
met him out there, and we talked about that, and 
then I think he went that fall, it was the fall of 49,

29:21.393 --> 29:47.226
to Norway, Bergen, for a sabbatical or something. 
And that's funny, he did his 1950 paper. And then of

29:52.595 --> 30:04.673
course there was a long period when I didn't know 
him very well. He wanted us to get out of

30:05.774 --> 30:08.879
oceanography for a period then. I don't know 
exactly when, probably about 1953, 1968 or 65. It

30:14.627 --> 30:21.117
was a period of maybe a little over 10 years when he 
worked primarily on geophysical problems. Not

30:21.653 --> 30:25.159
Oceans. So then, actually, I wasn't

30:25.179 --> 30:31.389
really following very much what he was doing 
there. Then we went to... Then, of course, I saw him

30:31.409 --> 30:38.160
again in 1959 when we were there for the spring one 
time.

30:41.684 --> 30:46.273
We haven't ever done, never really did it very much 
together. We did, I think maybe this one paper that

30:48.717 --> 30:57.354
he and, Walter and I and Horowitz wrote on

30:48.717 --> 30:57.354
internal weight measurements. I don't remember 
the date of that. Probably 1956, 1955.

31:03.082 --> 31:12.052
The question was rather, by the way, an unfair one 
for this reason, is because he says that by the 50s,

31:03.082 --> 31:12.052
he thinks you're doing the most important work in 
oceanography being done. How would you answer

31:12.672 --> 31:13.513
that? Well, that's very nice of him. Of course, he 
was not working in the field, so I didn't have any

31:17.237 --> 31:22.423
competition. But I don't think that's perhaps... 
I don't think that's... Well, I mean, the point is

31:31.178 --> 31:35.403
that there's very little being done. And I think 
that's the real answer. Okay. So, but, you know,

31:39.968 --> 31:50.220
the point is that then, you know, by 51 or 52, then, 
you know, clearly you've established yourself in

31:39.968 --> 31:50.220
this particular discipline as the leader. And so 
I'm a little surprised about the way the grants are

31:50.400 --> 31:55.046
operating then between 52 and 60. Yeah, but, I 
mean, that's a personality problem. If you have

31:59.210 --> 32:00.612
a... a nice comfortable arrangement in a 
laboratory where the director's a nice guy and you

32:01.132 --> 32:12.762
can

32:01.132 --> 32:12.762
it's very easy to argue
