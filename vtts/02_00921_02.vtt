00:01.043 --> 00:15.162
Okay, what is Fort Worth, the city of Fort Worth's 
relationship, the planning department's

00:01.043 --> 00:15.162
relationship with the county planning 
department? There is none. We don't, and

00:16.343 --> 00:25.976
generally the reason is they don't, in our county 
there's no zoning jurisdiction. We do have

00:25.996 --> 00:29.481
jurisdiction in terms of planning. They have to 
meet all our subdivision regulations, but only in

00:30.153 --> 00:48.880
terms of the planning itself, not in terms of 
construction of the street and so forth. So that

00:48.900 --> 00:50.282
would be the only relationship. But we really 
don't have to work with the county on any type of

00:50.302 --> 00:51.924
planning. Actually, I don't even think our county 
does that much planning. But I'm all about

00:53.246 --> 00:54.167
planning, I should say. OK, is there any 
relationship with the state planning

00:54.187 --> 00:58.253
department? Do you have any association with 
anybody?

01:07.161 --> 01:16.211
The only association would probably be with the 
Texas Historical Commission, if anything. We

01:16.231 --> 01:23.259
have a cultural and advisory, a historical and 
cultural advisory board, and we work with them,

01:16.231 --> 01:23.259
and also work with, sometime we have to work with 
the Texas Historical Commission on certain sites

01:16.231 --> 01:23.259
at times. Okay. Other than that, there's no, I 
don't know. Okay, there's

01:26.735 --> 01:36.999
a popular nightclub in Fort Worth called Billy 
Bob's. Have there been any effects on planning

01:37.340 --> 01:44.136
from that? institution. Have you had to consider 
that in any of your plans? Oh, yeah. Well, we

01:51.440 --> 01:57.855
consider it every time we start looking at that 
area, what kind of an impact that has had on the

01:51.440 --> 01:57.855
community. And they are in the process right now of 
developing or requesting a grant. A UDAG grant

02:03.421 --> 02:11.758
from the federal government to develop. UDAG, 
meaning? UDAG is a Urban Development Action

02:12.259 --> 02:13.501
Grant. It comes out in the Community Development 
Block Program, Forest Park. It is like that.

02:24.464 --> 02:43.317
Actually,

02:24.464 --> 02:43.317
what they're trying to do is to build like a family 
amusement center for the area, but also include,

02:24.464 --> 02:43.317
you know, 35 and have restaurants and other things 
to bring more visitors to the area. The influence

02:44.174 --> 03:04.329
of

02:44.174 --> 03:04.329
billybogg is really mainly on transportation and 
it really is a problem on some nights that there's

02:44.174 --> 03:04.329
just so many parliament bills there that it causes 
a traffic problem. But that's, you know, that's

03:04.349 --> 03:06.132
just used on heavy nights. At one time, we had some 
trolleys running from downtown to Billy Bob's so

03:06.500 --> 03:19.114
people wouldn't have to worry about the traffic. 
And I don't know if that's still going on now. Some

03:20.875 --> 03:21.236
what, really? Trolleys. Oh. They're just, you 
know, busses. They're really buses that go by the

03:25.160 --> 03:28.444
trolley. It has an influence to that. But when we 
probably, in a later time, do a more detailed study

03:29.725 --> 03:36.372
of the area, that's going to be one of the biggest 
things to take care of the traffic and access into.

03:36.824 --> 03:43.036
I'm

03:36.824 --> 03:43.036
just speculating. I'm speculating that what had 
happened in Fort Worth, that you had a major

03:43.056 --> 03:56.503
influence by just a few people, so they wanted to 
sort of keep... Fort Worth, what it was,

03:57.175 --> 04:10.612
and not change it. And these influence has slowed 
the development of the city down. Whereas in

04:16.760 --> 04:18.122
Dallas, I think it's been just the opposite. You 
know, there haven't totally been major families

04:18.142 --> 04:20.005
that have influence all over that area. I really 
think this has been good for Fort Worth. And I think

04:21.627 --> 04:37.787
it has grown, and the reason it has really added 
some quality to the community in terms of what to do

04:21.627 --> 04:37.787
with the river, what to do with the downtown. Here 
you have Bob Bass who, you know, His wealth comes

04:44.392 --> 04:50.181
from all. It comes from a previous family that was 
noted in the community. He's given back to the

04:57.833 --> 05:02.020
community. I mean, he's got two major office 
structures downtown. I know they're not full. And

05:08.970 --> 05:09.371
so it's costing. But somehow, what he has done is 
added such a major influence on the downtown that

05:09.391 --> 05:12.576
it's going It's going

05:13.096 --> 05:26.688
to be the scene for the future of the community. I 
mean, it's just not the same. You go downtown

05:30.071 --> 05:33.174
Dallas, and what do you see? All skyscrapers, and 
you walk for blocks, and that's all you're going to

05:33.194 --> 05:35.156
see. It's a nice park area. I'm not saying they 
don't, but I'm saying as opposed to Fort Worth, you

05:35.637 --> 05:37.458
have a main street. You have two major vistas that 
you can look down and see, the courthouse at Money

05:37.478 --> 05:40.521
Engine Night, downtown

05:42.998 --> 05:52.708
county convention center at the other end. So I 
really think it has helped us in terms of going . I

05:57.913 --> 06:06.762
think the influence has been from the previous 
people that lived and had influence in the

05:57.913 --> 06:06.762
community. Now you're saying the influence of the 
wealthy people now is slowly bringing in the

06:06.782 --> 06:12.988
business. But the ancestor from the people that 
had the quality of trying to keep Fort Worth small

06:13.306 --> 06:27.535
and not grow out of control, now they're children. 
are now

06:28.510 --> 06:46.111
the

06:28.510 --> 06:46.111
implementers

06:28.510 --> 06:46.111
of these plans

06:28.510 --> 06:46.111
that they'll have. Again, even though it's 
influenced and changing, it's a positive aspect.

06:49.615 --> 06:52.118
They're setting the scene for maybe their 
children, I guess, for the future. His last

06:52.138 --> 06:54.501
brother, one of his brothers, developed this 
caravan to eat downtown. I don't know if you're

06:54.521 --> 06:55.362
familiar with that. I mean,

06:55.915 --> 07:11.816
for a community

06:55.915 --> 07:11.816
of this size, they have something like this that's 
phenomenal. There's

07:11.836 --> 07:18.204
a theater there. They have, you know, all the 
famous jazz singers have come here, or do come

07:18.224 --> 07:20.067
here. So it's really, you know, it's something 
that you would think would be dating New York or

07:20.087 --> 07:23.071
something. I mean, there's hell right here in Fort 
Worth. So it's just, it's unbelievable.
