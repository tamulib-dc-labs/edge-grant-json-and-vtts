WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:03.024
in Fort Worth. What is today's date? The 16th of 
August.

00:09.572 --> 00:17.281
I'd like to ask you first if you will donate this 
tape and the material on this tape to Texas A&M

00:09.572 --> 00:17.281
University Oral History Collection. I'd be very 
happy to donate this tape and the contents of it to

00:17.302 --> 00:23.769
Texas A&M University. Great. Now let's start out 
with Where and when you were born? You were born in

00:29.356 --> 00:31.759
1912 right here in Fort Worth. Could you tell me 
about your parents? Yes. My father was a very

00:35.883 --> 00:41.349
hardworking individual. He pursued most of his, 
all of his adult life in the industrial supply

00:41.529 --> 00:48.737
business. And in 1932, he came at the request of his 
sister, Mrs. Charles F. Adams, and helped her run

00:58.857 --> 01:10.133
her business, which was left in her laps by the 
death of her husband, Charles Francis Adams. And

01:10.153 --> 01:18.144
my mother was a descendant from German parentage. 
Her mother and father both came directly from

01:19.446 --> 01:28.459
Germany to the United States.

01:28.827 --> 01:37.843
they came separately and they met in South Bend, 
Indiana and came to Fort Worth with a group of

01:28.827 --> 01:37.843
German families. They actually came in a wagon 
train from South Bend, Indiana to Fort Worth and

01:38.986 --> 01:52.911
her parents, her father was in the brick

01:57.802 --> 02:01.186
He built it very, very close to the Trinity River. 
And in a very severe flood,

02:01.887 --> 02:12.481
I guess in the early 1900s, the brickyard was 
washed away. But not before he had furnished the

02:13.202 --> 02:22.273
bricks to build the original Swift & Company and 
Armour & Company packing plants. Really? Which

02:23.057 --> 02:29.502
were in Fort Worth and really established Fort 
Worth as a great packing house center. And his

02:31.084 --> 02:34.207
brick plant was washed away. When was this, the 
turn of the century?

02:39.091 --> 02:41.173
I guess it was in the early 1900s. I'm not real sure 
when the first of the Swifton Company and the

02:42.154 --> 02:50.742
Armoring Company packing house plants were 
built. they have in the past few years have started

02:51.093 --> 02:55.058
to be torn down. The debris and the partially 
demolished Swifton Company plant is still

02:56.940 --> 03:06.632
standing out on north side Fort Worth. And it 
burned after it had been closed down and then it was

03:08.013 --> 03:14.721
demolished. But we went out two, three years ago 
and retrieved some of the bricks, some of the

03:15.602 --> 03:21.049
original bricks and keep them as mementos of some 
of our early family life. But my father, after

03:27.158 --> 03:42.115
he joined Mrs. Adams in this business that I run 
today and I'm the principal owner of, he was an

03:27.158 --> 03:42.115
outstanding salesman. He could absolutely sell,

03:42.215 --> 03:50.985
I think he could sell bikinis at the North Pole sell 
fur coats in Panama. He was terrific and had a very,

03:55.205 --> 04:04.036
very wide acquaintance and following in the 
Southwest, the whole Southwest. What kind of man

04:04.536 --> 04:08.160
was he, besides being a good salesman? He was a big 
guy, a very happy individual, and made friends

04:09.562 --> 04:19.133
very, very easily.

04:21.492 --> 04:23.974
Well, I think he was a pretty good guy, really. And 
it's been a real pleasure to me since coming back to

04:24.675 --> 04:35.765
Texas to occasionally meet someone that knew him 
and the nice things they say about him. So it's a

04:35.825 --> 04:42.531
pretty good legacy to have people tell you what a 
nice guy your dad was and so forth. So I really, I

04:42.551 --> 04:48.917
guess in the last 10 years, I've grown fonder of him 
than I think I was prior to that time. He passed away

04:59.331 --> 05:01.273
in 67. No,

05:01.493 --> 05:05.618
I'm sorry. He passed away in 66. That was before I 
retired. And I was on a trip. I had seen him about

05:13.086 --> 05:18.752
two months before.

05:22.968 --> 05:24.450
And then I was on a trip. I was in San Francisco when I 
learned of his death and I flew directly into here.

05:31.578 --> 05:33.240
Can you tell me about your mother? My mother was a 
very,

05:35.042 --> 05:43.192
very nice person, very good person. She was a 
generous person. She had a lot of, a lot of Germanic

05:45.595 --> 05:52.603
characteristics and was a very strict 
disciplinarian. I guess that's her Prussian

05:56.716 --> 06:00.642
heritage. Was she from the Prussian area? Well, 
she was born in this country and born, matter of

06:04.208 --> 06:12.000
fact, born in Fort Worth. But her mother... But her 
mother was from the Prussian area? Yeah, they very

06:14.985 --> 06:21.696
definitely, her mother, quite a story behind her 
mother's family. And her father came from

06:22.655 --> 06:29.826
Bingen on the Rhine River. And he was a tradesman. 
His whole family were tradesmen. I think they were

06:36.437 --> 06:42.607
brickmakers in Germany, or makers of tile and 
brick in Germany. Her mother's family was from

06:44.350 --> 06:49.017
East Prussia. the eastern part of Prussia, and her 
mother's mother, which would be my mother's

06:51.190 --> 07:21.163
grandmother, was actually, it was reported, and I 
don't know this for a fact, but just from things

06:51.190 --> 07:21.163
that I remember my mother's mother saying, and I 
used to, she lived with us in the last years of her

06:51.190 --> 07:21.163
life, and she spoke

07:25.177 --> 07:26.018
native tongue. And she and her husband formed a 
German church here in Fort Worth. A

07:32.125 --> 07:34.227
congregational German church. And during the 
First World War, they had to stop having services

07:35.568 --> 07:42.937
because of so much German, anti-German feeling. 
And after World War I, they resumed the German

07:44.478 --> 07:50.885
services in the church once a month. And I They say 
that I spoke German before I spoke English. I spoke

08:00.192 --> 08:03.956
German when I was three or four years old. I don't 
really have a conscious recollection of speaking

08:04.136 --> 08:15.008
German, but they say I spoke German when I was three 
or four years old. And then way back in my

08:15.028 --> 08:24.478
subconscious was this child of three or four years 
old vocabulary of German. understanding or a

08:24.627 --> 08:44.087
knowledge of it and I know in my some of my brief

08:24.627 --> 08:44.087
usages and opportunity to use it in Germany during 
the war in

08:24.627 --> 08:44.087
asking directions and so

08:48.623 --> 08:57.176
in German, if it was very simple that a child would 
know or know about, I would understand it. Or if

08:58.718 --> 09:02.484
they spoke very fast, I couldn't get any of it. And I 
would always say to them, ,, speak more slowly,

09:03.305 --> 09:08.212
please. And I would understand what a child of four 
years old might understand.

09:16.535 --> 09:19.840
that was made very, very, very noticeable to me. 
Let's stop here for now. Could you tell me about

09:23.465 --> 09:28.072
about your parents a little bit more 
specifically? Were they religious people? Who

09:30.676 --> 09:33.139
was the authority in the household? Could you tell 
me about that? I would say that my mother was the

09:35.483 --> 09:39.028
authority in the household. Now, they were of 
average following and belief. We went to church

09:47.515 --> 09:49.397
regularly. I grew up going to Sunday school and so 
forth. But they weren't devoutly religious. Were

09:57.565 --> 09:59.127
they interested in politics? No, no. My father was 
not interested in politics and neither was my

10:01.830 --> 10:06.695
mother. Did they vote usually for one party versus 
another? Yes, they usually voted, primarily

10:10.499 --> 10:13.862
voted I believe Democratic, but quite often voted 
Republican for the man, for the individual. Would

10:21.329 --> 10:27.076
you, did you consider them either conservatives 
or liberals or moderates? Conservatives,

10:27.316 --> 10:33.122
definitely conservatives, yeah. Now you became a 
general and throughout your career, what do you

10:33.222 --> 10:41.031
think, what What contribution do you think that 
your parents made in your future success?

10:49.983 --> 10:56.552
A sense of integrity and

10:49.983 --> 10:56.552
honesty.

10:59.556 --> 11:08.629
And I think

10:59.556 --> 11:08.629
doing a little bit more than it was expected of you. 
To me, extra effort. is the

11:12.196 --> 11:28.959
number one characteristic that I believe would 
help almost anybody do a job better than the PAC.

11:30.801 --> 11:39.233
And it's something that often some of your peers 
may say that, well, you're a brown noser

11:44.528 --> 12:03.147
It's just having a sense of belonging or a sense of 
owning and trying to do a job and not being a

11:44.528 --> 12:03.147
perfectionist because we're all subject to human 
faculties and making mistakes. But I think if you

12:03.227 --> 12:14.198
put forth extra effort and I know my dad was always 
enthusiastic about everything. And I've always

12:15.258 --> 12:19.282
had that characteristic too. And I think 
enthusiasm and extra effort are the two greatest

12:19.302 --> 12:26.649
characteristics that a human can have. Let's 
start in about your education. Where'd you go to

12:28.952 --> 12:29.792
school? I went to the primary schools here in Fort 
Worth and to high school. So you had a public

12:36.579 --> 12:37.960
education? Public education all the way. No 
private education. education at all. I was a good

12:44.591 --> 12:47.714
student, a very good student. One of the top in the 
class? It was easy for me. Yes, I would say I was in

12:53.900 --> 12:59.666
grade schools and high school. I was in the top 3% of 
the class. I didn't do that well at A&M. I don't

13:10.878 --> 13:13.121
really know why. I never really thought about it. I 
had a lot of outside activities. I worked hard at

13:20.451 --> 13:22.654
football. I was not an athlete. I had very little 
natural athletic ability. I know Matty Bell told

13:28.823 --> 13:38.556
me, he said I had less native ability as a football 
player than any player he ever saw. But I played

13:39.380 --> 13:42.944
nine months out of the year down at school. I played 
intramural and then spring training. And so I

13:47.530 --> 13:53.257
worked real hard because I wanted to be a good 
football player. And I did make one letter,

13:53.277 --> 13:56.280
finally. Did you play high school football or any 
other sports? I played high school football,

14:00.085 --> 14:01.987
yeah. Did you play other sports in high school? 
Baseball. And I played baseball on the freshman

14:05.772 --> 14:09.336
team at A&M. And the coach, I forget the bastard's 
name, but in one of the inter-squad games, I struck

14:10.177 --> 14:18.870
out. I was the first baseman, and I loved playing 
baseball. And I struck out, and that bastard cut me

14:23.917 --> 14:29.746
off of the squad and just broke my heart. And they 
had no damn reason. I was better first baseman than

14:32.409 --> 14:39.019
the guy he kept, a big, tall guy from McKinney, 
Texas. But that really was a blow to me when that guy

14:40.282 --> 14:46.689
cut me off of the fish baseball team at A&M. I didn't 
go out for freshman football at A&M because I just

14:47.630 --> 14:53.937
didn't think I was good enough. So I played 
intramural football on the second battalion

14:55.258 --> 15:03.347
artillery team and did real well. Made two, three 
touchdowns. That was in the end. And of course the

15:07.214 --> 15:12.921
coaches all watched the intramural games for 
potential. So lo and behold, as a result of the

15:12.941 --> 15:25.836
intramural, why they asked me to come out for the 
varsity in the fall, which I did, which I thought

15:12.941 --> 15:25.836
was a big honor. No kidding. And

15:27.778 --> 15:36.208
the only course I ever busted anywhere, the only 
course I ever failed, was at A&M in strength of

15:36.627 --> 15:44.897
materials by Professor Long, C.D. Long, who was in 
my class. His brother was a professor in the M.E.

15:50.905 --> 15:51.486
department. And I think that he and I got cross 
ways. I don't think I really busted a chord. I think

15:58.054 --> 16:04.542
he busted me because he felt that I hadn't put forth 
the effort that I should have or that I could have,

16:04.825 --> 16:11.491
and then I, that I didn't show the potential that I 
should. That's the only course I ever busted. Were

16:14.474 --> 16:15.875
you popular in high school? Yeah, fairly popular. 
Were you a leader? Were you a leader of any

16:20.280 --> 16:21.921
organizations? I'm always wondering when 
generals, who of course have positions of

16:21.981 --> 16:28.327
leadership, started to become leaders. Yeah, I 
was a leader of, we had Oh, several clubs. Then

16:36.419 --> 16:48.650
during the grade school years and early high 
school years, we were pretty strong here in Fort

16:36.419 --> 16:48.650
Worth in calisthenics. And you know, they don't do 
that anymore, but I remember we used to, every day,

16:49.611 --> 17:02.743
the class or two or three classes get together, the 
gym classes would, and go through a routine of sort

17:03.213 --> 17:06.156
of drill calisthenics. And he even had a long rod, 
kind of like a curtain rod, that we'd used. All

17:12.181 --> 17:15.784
sorts of shapes and routines. And I was, I was 
picked as a leader several times in those, for

17:16.885 --> 17:23.151
those things. But I was not a joiner. I didn't join a 
lot of things in a lot of clubs, because I and I never

17:34.060 --> 17:36.682
had a whole lot of money. Our family was never, 
never destitute. We were never, you know, overly

17:41.327 --> 17:44.730
flushed with money. My father made a I guess a 
better than average salary when he worked in the

17:44.750 --> 17:59.464
early days in industrial supply as a as a salesman 
and later as a sales manager for a company here in

17:44.750 --> 17:59.464
Fort Warren. But Well, I wouldn't say I was any hot 
shot leader in school. No, not particularly. Why

18:09.918 --> 18:10.859
were you popular? Why was I popular?

18:17.368 --> 18:19.350
I didn't have any enemies, per se. I wasn't 
prejudiced against and didn't really go out of my

18:20.271 --> 18:29.824
way to harass anybody. I was just trying to be a 
pretty good guy. And I was fairly popular with the

18:34.557 --> 18:45.948
gals, not extremely popular,

18:34.557 --> 18:45.948
but I had a lot of girlfriends.

18:48.350 --> 18:51.273
When you graduated from high school, is that about 
1929 or 1930? Yeah, 1929. 1929. When you graduated

18:54.456 --> 18:58.760
from high school, did you have a firm set of aims? 
Did you know what you wanted to do? Yeah, I sure did.

19:03.886 --> 19:09.315
I wanted to be a petroleum engineer and that's what 
I wanted to do. Well no, first I wanted to be an

19:09.415 --> 19:16.768
army aviator. Oh really? And I had applied. So is 
that the first time that you ever thought about the

19:19.633 --> 19:23.399
military? I guess so.

19:29.468 --> 19:32.572
Randolph Field to be admitted to Randolph. In 
those days it was Randolph for primary and Kelly

19:32.652 --> 19:37.840
for the secondary. So my senior year in the spring I 
had made application and I was ordered down to

19:39.122 --> 19:50.458
Galveston. There was a little Army Air Corps base 
at Galveston and a board convened down there to

19:57.599 --> 20:27.538
examine the candidates for the Army Air Corps and 
about 15 of us went down from A&M down to Galveston

19:57.599 --> 20:27.538
and went before the board and physical exams and so 
forth and I passed everything except the physical

19:57.599 --> 20:27.538
and they said that I had eye fatigue and that 
someday I would have to wear glasses and They

20:28.278 --> 20:33.903
didn't think that I could do, you know, precision 
flying and so forth and so on. So, that was a real big

20:34.704 --> 20:38.948
disappointment to me. And before that though, I 
had already learned to fly. Oh really? Yeah,

20:48.017 --> 20:55.264
because one year for my junior year in this for the 
half year, for the second, in 1932. See, I started

21:00.288 --> 21:08.957
out with a class of 33, but I finished up with a class 
of 34 because I dropped out half a year. I had an

21:09.117 --> 21:13.102
illness. I guess I was overworked or something. I 
just fell apart. I don't know if it was mono or what

21:17.727 --> 21:21.451
the hell. But before the end of this, I had, for the 
second half in 32, but just a few days before I would

21:28.083 --> 21:43.604
have lost credit or given a D for everything, I 
dropped out of school. I thought it was the best,

21:43.844 --> 21:47.569
and the doctors thought it was the best. So I 
dropped out, and I came home, and I went to work over

21:47.589 --> 21:55.440
here in this business for Mr. Adams. He hadn't 
passed away yet. And

21:57.901 --> 22:04.490
I worked out in the shop making cup leathers. See, 
we actually have two businesses here. We're a

22:08.716 --> 22:15.165
little manufacturing business that we carry on, 
and we're a gasket cutter as well. And then we are

22:15.205 --> 22:22.856
manufacturer's reps, where we represent 
manufacturers in the Southwest. In the last few

22:23.797 --> 22:27.402
years, I've started a little oil company in 
addition. We've got actually three businesses

22:28.107 --> 22:31.071
going out here now. But anyway, I worked over here. 
And I got started going out to Meacham Field.

22:40.986 --> 22:43.250
And taking flying lessons. And I soloed. And I 
worked for a guy out there that had a little flying

22:45.293 --> 22:49.379
school. He had Richie. I'd work for him in the 
afternoon for three or four hours. And instead of

22:53.805 --> 22:57.591
taking pay, I'd take it out in flying time. and he'd 
give me maybe 15 or 20 minutes of instruction for

22:57.824 --> 23:03.732
three or four hours of work. And I'd service the 
airplanes for him, little Arrancas and little

23:04.974 --> 23:09.961
Curtis Robins. So I learned to fly and I had all, at 
the time we took the exam for Randolph, I had about

23:11.524 --> 23:23.781
75 hours I guess of time. So you were about a junior 
then at A&M when you took the exam? Yeah, yeah. And

23:32.278 --> 23:36.606
so that was a big, big blow to me. But after I 
graduated that

23:36.647 --> 23:43.761
summer,

23:55.233 --> 23:59.058
division office out in Crane, Texas, out in West 
Texas. Well before we get to that, let's go back,

23:59.118 --> 24:03.663
let's go back a little bit. In other words, the 
Depression didn't hurt your family that much. Not

24:07.768 --> 24:09.210
at all, not at all. We, the Depression didn't hurt 
our family at all. My father was gainfully

24:13.936 --> 24:18.962
employed all during the Depression and we 
certainly never, never suffered at all in the

24:20.512 --> 24:25.957
Depression. I think my dad, there was a bank 
failure here in Fort Worth. A couple of banks

24:31.902 --> 24:34.004
failed. One of them failed. He had a checking 
account and a small savings account in it. As far as

24:40.149 --> 24:48.697
I know, that was the only severe monetary setback 
as a result of the Depression. And then, too,

24:51.089 --> 24:54.354
During the early 30s, I was down at A&M. Sure. We 
didn't really, I didn't really suffer then. I did a

24:58.139 --> 24:59.141
lot of work. I worked in the mess hall. And

25:02.145 --> 25:10.778
I had the midnight mail concession for a while. You 
know what the midnight mail is? No. Well, I don't

25:13.462 --> 25:16.006
know where they still- Oh, is that the train coming 
by? I don't know if they still do that or not. In

25:18.815 --> 25:26.728
those days, it finally became a football and I got 
it kind of a quasi football job. But in each

25:27.789 --> 25:34.580
dormitory, and we had about 14 of them in those 
days, 12 I guess counting them. Yeah, some of them

25:35.462 --> 25:38.406
are torn down now. But anyway, we had a mailbox in 
each one of these dormitories.

25:47.317 --> 25:53.384
And guys, alongside this box was another little 
box with half envelopes. So if during the night you

25:54.365 --> 26:15.831
wanted to get off a letter and be sure it got out that 
night and you wrote it, say, after supper, you

25:54.365 --> 26:15.831
could take your letter with a stamp on it, put it in 
one of those half envelopes, drop a nickel in the

25:54.365 --> 26:15.831
half envelope, and then drop it in the box, the 
midnight mail box. And about 11.30 went around,

26:18.012 --> 26:34.054
opened all those boxes up, took the nickels they 
had, and go down to the railroad station, and we

26:18.012 --> 26:34.054
mailed them on the train, on the OWL, the train out 
of Houston towards Dallas, Fort Worth. And mailed

26:34.074 --> 26:38.521
all of them on that eastbound train, on that 
northbound train. And then that northbound train

26:39.242 --> 26:47.513
sorted the mail and inhearned anything that was 
for Houston and southbound traffic, they put it

26:47.678 --> 26:56.929
off of that train and gave it to the southbound 
train, which they met up with in Heard. And that was

26:58.311 --> 27:00.374
called a midnight mail. So you collected nickels 
then? The first year I had that, I did it myself

27:04.959 --> 27:07.943
every night. And collect those nickels. And every 
night you'd get, oh 20, 25, or 30,

27:20.332 --> 27:25.741
or before a big football game or something, hell 
you might get 50 or 60 nickels. Two, three, or four

27:26.402 --> 27:27.664
dollars. And a couple of nights raining real hard. 
Instead of walking down the railroad station, I

27:34.796 --> 27:38.302
mailed them in the Y.

27:41.307 --> 27:43.590
But it was quite a, quite a little deal. And then 
next year,

27:53.525 --> 28:01.112
And I gave him a guaranteed a dollar a night just to 
go get the mail and take it down and mail it. It was a

28:01.833 --> 28:03.074
good deal for him. It was a good deal for me. I 
trusted him. But no, the depression never

28:07.918 --> 28:14.925
really, you know, we didn't suffer. We had a lot of 
fun. Many times I hitchhiked to Houston with 50

28:17.107 --> 28:20.950
cents in my pocket. Now, when you went to A&M, did 
you already make up your mind that you want to be a

28:22.567 --> 28:29.016
patrolling engineer, and is that why you went? Yes 
and no. It's really quite strange. I had wanted to

28:34.865 --> 28:38.010
go to A&M. Why? But the summer, I liked the 
military, and I'd seen the Corps trips come up here

28:39.191 --> 28:48.625
and the guys parading and everything.

28:59.658 --> 29:00.860
him by his tails. He had been a first sergeant and a 
cavalry troop from Pennsylvania volunteers that

29:02.021 --> 29:18.121
saw duty after the Civil War even in Texas out in 
Fort Concho in San Angelo. So I was pretty much

29:18.141 --> 29:27.994
wanted to go to a military school, but after I got 
out of high school one of my relatives, a relative

29:18.141 --> 29:27.994
of was one of the big wheels out of Texas Tech. And he 
wanted me to come out there and said I would get a

29:35.204 --> 29:44.262
scholarship and get a job and everything. So I 
reluctantly went

30:01.353 --> 30:14.270
And I got a job and they were going to give me a 
partial scholarship and I got a job working in

30:01.353 --> 30:14.270
either a Piggly Wiggly or Safeway or one of the 
supermarkets. Found a place to live temporarily

30:14.930 --> 30:20.758
until the dormitories opened and I was really set 
up. Real, real good. And the lady that I had a room

30:23.762 --> 30:30.330
with had a couple of daughters my age and they were 
in

30:35.356 --> 30:36.598
age. But some sand started to set in and the sand got 
to blowing and goddamn it blew for days and days and

30:37.819 --> 30:51.836
I said to hell with this noise I'm going to A&M. So I 
quit my job got on the damn train with my trunks and I

30:51.856 --> 31:04.131
went to College Station passed through Fort Worth 
never called my folks or anything got off of the

31:05.005 --> 31:34.472
damn train at College Station, and one of the night 
sergeants was down there, and I think it was about

31:05.005 --> 31:34.472
seven or eight o'clock in the evening, and he said, 
you're a little early, it was about three weeks

31:05.005 --> 31:34.472
before school started, and I told him, I said, 
well, I'm coming, I just came in from Lovell, and he

31:05.005 --> 31:34.472
said, well, you can't spend the night down here, he 
said, come on, put your bag up on this dolly. You

31:41.320 --> 31:45.786
know, one of those express wagons, big four-wheel 
wagons. And he said, I'll help you pull it up here.

31:50.152 --> 31:56.581
And we pulled it up the street there, and he stopped 
over by Law and Pervier Hall. And he said, let's

31:57.602 --> 32:00.526
throw your trunk off here. He says, you take the 
wagon back to the station. And... by the time you

32:05.857 --> 32:15.686
get back I'll have a key and I'll let you, I'll put 
you in one of these rooms here in the first stoop of

32:05.857 --> 32:15.686
law, I guess it was. So I did, I pulled a goddamn 
wagon back down to the station and he wanted to know

32:17.288 --> 32:25.495
if I'd eaten and I said no. He said well, he said the 
only thing that's open is a little store down here

32:25.536 --> 32:34.564
and he showed me where that was and you can go down 
there and get a sandwich. He said, you can stay over

32:35.371 --> 32:36.993
here. He said, there's no sheets or anything, just 
the beds with mattresses. But the water's on. You

32:42.940 --> 32:44.602
can stay in there tonight. He said, tomorrow you go 
up to the commandant's office

32:45.363 --> 32:54.834
and tell them who you are and what you want to do and 
everything. So he was a real nice guy. I saw him many

32:57.717 --> 32:59.599
times after that. I don't remember his name. But he 
was kind of an elderly gentleman, a real kind

33:00.821 --> 33:04.365
fellow. So he really got me started off in great 
fashion. And the next morning, I had no trouble

33:10.552 --> 33:13.717
that night. He opened the door for me and 
everything. Next morning, bright and early, I was

33:16.341 --> 33:20.708
up in the main building there, the old main 
building. The Commandant's office before they

33:20.788 --> 33:23.392
opened. I was standing on the outside waiting. And 
the Assistant Commandant, the Commandant was a

33:27.077 --> 33:33.407
military guy, Nelson, Bull Nelson. But the 
assistant commandant was a civilian, Johnny,

33:34.265 --> 33:40.254
God, I can't remember his name. But of all the 
things, he knew my father. No kidding. Yeah. From

33:47.043 --> 33:54.394
some, he met him someplace and had seen him two or 
three times after that. So when I was standing

33:54.414 --> 33:58.720
there at the door and he unlocked the door and one of 
the ladies

34:06.749 --> 34:08.771
And then I said, well, come on in. He said, you're a 
little early. So, after I told him my story and

34:11.114 --> 34:16.841
everything, well, they were really intrigued 
with it. And he said, well, he said, you have any

34:17.682 --> 34:21.507
money? I said, well, I've got a little bit, not a 
whole lot, but I'd like to get a job. And he said,

34:27.174 --> 34:31.779
well, we'll just see if we can't put you to work 
doing something. So, it was about two weeks before

34:35.167 --> 34:36.970
school started. So he said, we just got from the 
printers the new house rules that we want

34:38.512 --> 34:46.243
everybody to live by. We've got to have a copy 
nailed in every room on the campus, nailed on the

34:46.283 --> 34:52.513
back of the front door. There were actually two 
little cards. So he said, you can do that. And he

34:59.884 --> 35:02.828
said, you have to go in every room every room and 
every dormitory, and nail these on the back of the

35:03.348 --> 35:07.093
door. He said, that'll take you at least a week, I 
know. So after you finish that, and he gave me all

35:11.679 --> 35:17.407
the stuff and everything, hammer and a little 
tacks. So I started in, and hell, in about five

35:18.848 --> 35:22.453
days, I was finished. So they gave me some other 
jobs to do. So anyway, to make a long story short, I

35:25.818 --> 35:29.963
worked. And before registration, he let me 
register early and everything. And they paid me 70

35:36.392 --> 35:43.140
cents an hour, I believe. 70 cents? Yeah. That's 
fantastic. Yeah. That's a lot of money with a

35:46.424 --> 35:48.706
minimum wage of 25 cents. Sure was. Sure was. Paid 
me 70 cents an hour for going around tacking up all

35:52.090 --> 36:00.220
of those cards and all the rooms and everything. So 
that was enough to, you know, to pay for my food and

36:01.381 --> 36:05.727
everything. A few days there. What outfit were you 
put in in the Corps? F-Artillery. And it was a, I was

36:11.516 --> 36:16.102
a charter member because they just organized it 
that year. And

36:17.705 --> 36:28.300
it, I, you know, it was a real, real good start and a 
real good experience.

36:31.216 --> 36:41.113
By luck, the good Lord had his arms around me that 
Johnny, it wasn't Johnny Mitchell, no, I'll think

36:31.216 --> 36:41.113
of it, I'll recall it here in a minute. Anyway, he, 
you know, the fact that he knew, knew my father and

36:41.133 --> 36:49.448
knew my family was bound to have helped in some way. 
If I'd have been a total cold stranger, I might not

36:50.089 --> 36:56.700
have gotten the consideration and everything 
that I did. But I was, my mind was pretty much made up

36:57.642 --> 37:08.395
that if I couldn't be a military aviator that I 
wanted to go ahead and work and be a petroleum

36:57.642 --> 37:08.395
engineer. And I never changed from that and I had a 
kind of a fallback that if I didn't go the petroleum

37:09.577 --> 37:22.273
end of it that I'd be a chemical engineer. And the 
first

37:28.810 --> 37:43.610
But after my sophomore year with geology, 
historical geology, and a couple of the

37:28.810 --> 37:43.610
professors that I had, I was definitely sold that I 
wanted to be a patrol engineer. What did you like

37:43.630 --> 37:45.833
about the Corps of Cadets? What did I like about it? 
I guess I liked the military routine. I liked the

37:56.384 --> 38:01.410
idea in those days that, you know, we had 
formations for meals. And I would always get a big

38:02.431 --> 38:08.478
charge in the evenings at retreat. We'd just stay 
in retreat and march to the mess hall. And later,

38:14.305 --> 38:25.378
when I was working in the mess hall and waiting 
tables on the training table, well of course I

38:14.305 --> 38:25.378
wasn't in formation, I'd walk down ahead of time 
and after I went out my junior and senior year when I

38:26.000 --> 38:53.779
was waiting on a training table I never really did 
anything just all I had to do was carry a white

38:26.000 --> 38:53.779
jacket and but I guess you know it's not corny I like 
the military

38:26.000 --> 38:53.779
routine And I got a charge out of stand and retreat 
and everything. Did you like the hazing?

39:03.811 --> 39:04.772
No, I didn't. And I thought that was, to me that was I 
think one of the foolish childish things about A&M

39:04.952 --> 39:14.302
in the early days. It was a falsified macho 
syndrome that I think that a lot of people latched

39:23.020 --> 39:28.007
on to. I know in our organization and in my freshman 
class we had a couple of guys that I knew were going

39:28.067 --> 39:45.653
to be just real horses asses when they became 
sophomores as far as the hazing is concerned and

39:28.067 --> 39:45.653
they both

39:49.312 --> 39:50.753
He was dead. He died in the war, died on Bataan. Kid 
from Dallas named George Brundrett. Heck of a nice

39:57.340 --> 39:58.241
guy. He was my roommate for a few months. But he was 
killed in one of those prisoner of war ships that we

40:02.365 --> 40:10.774
torpedoed unknowingly. The Japs were 
transporting some of our prisoners from the

40:11.334 --> 40:17.901
Philippines back to Japan. and the ship was 
torpedoed by one of our own submarines. George was

40:22.507 --> 40:23.688
on one of them.

40:27.552 --> 40:32.497
No, I think the hazing was not a good thing. I don't 
think it really hurt anybody, but it certainly

40:35.080 --> 40:39.305
didn't do anybody any good. What were some other 
things about the Corps that you disliked?

40:49.066 --> 40:57.837
Oh,

40:49.066 --> 40:57.837
I don't, I don't guess there's anything 
significantly that I dislike per se. In what way do

40:57.857 --> 41:05.887
you think that the Corps helped you in your 
military career, or is there any way that it might

40:57.857 --> 41:05.887
have hindered your career? I think it definitely 
helped it. I think that our, our, that the, that the

41:10.152 --> 41:18.162
military program and the military the situation 
at A&M in those days, the Corps in those days,

41:19.002 --> 41:40.832
particularly in the military science courses 
that we pursued after

41:19.002 --> 41:40.832
the second two years, after the first two years, 
made us superior officers in our particular

41:19.002 --> 41:40.832
branches. In other words, I was field artillery. 
And I know the year that we graduated, we went to

41:45.057 --> 41:51.665
summer camp that year directly. We graduated and 
had final review. And I think the next morning, we

41:55.991 --> 42:02.199
were to report at Fort St. Houston. A bunch of us 
were. They gave us the option of going later in the

42:04.081 --> 42:08.327
summer. And I said, well, I don't have a job yet. 
Don't have to report till September. So we just

42:14.032 --> 42:15.894
went directly to camp. And I know down in Fort Sam, 
we went out on the firing range at Bullis and firing

42:16.835 --> 42:25.827
some problems, some artillery problems out 
there. Numerous times, we would be at the

42:27.148 --> 42:39.463
observation point and there'd be some graduates 
from the current class at West Point also there.

42:39.544 --> 42:40.765
There was a bunch of them. They were out there and 
they were trying to fire a problem and losing every

42:41.251 --> 42:53.944
round and not knowing where in the hell we were and 
the regular army officers would have one of us take

42:41.251 --> 42:53.944
over. And we were far superior to all of them in the 
particular technique and knowledge of our

42:54.864 --> 43:06.436
particular branch. Of course, they were a little 
better overall because They certainly had more

43:11.609 --> 43:23.561
and more concentrated, but in each particular 
branch, the graduate from Texas A&M was superior

43:11.609 --> 43:23.561
to the graduate of the military academy. Now, why 
were they a little bit better overall? They were a

43:28.125 --> 43:38.595
little bit better overall because they covered 
other curriculum in the military that we didn't

43:28.125 --> 43:38.595
particularly cover in A&M. better drill and 
formality and military law and all this sort of

43:40.938 --> 43:48.345
stuff. But in the pick and shovel nut and bolts of 
the artillery or the field artillery or coast

43:49.346 --> 44:08.785
artillery or even infantry officer, the 
graduate's man knew more about the tactical

43:49.346 --> 44:08.785
application of his particular branch than did the 
graduate of the military academy and I've had

44:09.220 --> 44:36.763
regular army tactical officers tell me that and I 
know later during the war

44:09.220 --> 44:36.763
some of my peers that were west pointers you know 
they were they'd look down their nose at you and not

44:09.220 --> 44:36.763
in a in an outward way but in an inward way The 
biggest feeling you get from that in the military

44:37.250 --> 44:44.779
was in the wives of West Pointers. Really? In their 
relationship with the wives of, we'll say, an A&M

44:46.641 --> 44:50.885
man. An officer from A&M. Yeah, some of the snippy 
little things with just, you know, my husband's a

44:53.088 --> 45:04.641
West Pointer and your husband was an ROTC officer 
and so forth. And

45:05.296 --> 45:14.011
most of the West Pointers, they pressed too hard. I 
have had a lot of good friends from the military

45:14.792 --> 45:19.180
academy in the service. Really, I can truthfully 
say I don't, am not conscious of any prejudice that

45:28.398 --> 45:39.030
they directed specifically towards me in any way 
because I was not a member, was not from the

45:28.398 --> 45:39.030
military academy. But there certainly was a lot of 
it and it was always present. But I always tried to

45:44.936 --> 45:51.123
feel like that, you know, we could hold our own 
against anything they could do. And I know and

45:56.326 --> 46:09.133
when it came out and it was an actual fact that Texas 
A&M furnished more officers for the military than

45:56.326 --> 46:09.133
did the military academy in World War II. This is an 
actual, there was some Aggie that was in the A.G.
