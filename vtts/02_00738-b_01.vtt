WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:08.218
what I call a legacy from President Walton. We came 
here that he came as president. He became

00:10.621 --> 00:18.710
president the same year that we came in as new 
members of the Department of History. And I don't

00:19.311 --> 00:31.405
know when it started, but I know it was in full swing 
in the early 30s because I remember the people who

00:19.311 --> 00:31.405
were honored this Christmas dinner or 
pre-Christmas dinner that he, presumably in the

00:32.110 --> 00:56.642
name of the college, but we always thought of it as 
coming from him, a Christmas dinner, which was

00:32.110 --> 00:56.642
given at the college a little bit before the 
Christmas holiday started, the Christmas

00:32.110 --> 00:56.642
vacation started, so that we could all get to it. 
And this was a very beautiful family style dinner.

01:01.186 --> 01:11.379
The platters were passed along, and it was for the 
faculty, and the teaching faculty, and the

01:01.186 --> 01:11.379
Experiment Station Extension Service people. 
And I remember once we had one of the waiters at Old

01:11.920 --> 01:22.693
Speeds Hall, what we now would say a black or a Negro 
man. And he was, we used to say colored in those

01:23.454 --> 01:26.518
days, And he was honored with 25 years. So you see, 
it was inclusive and democratic and rather nice.

01:35.888 --> 01:41.619
And we used to enjoy those get-togethers so much, 
because we all knew each other. How many people did

01:41.919 --> 01:43.863
you have at these get-togethers? Oh, let me see. I 
couldn't tell you. Do you have any idea of them?

01:49.735 --> 01:57.345
There might have been a couple of hundred on the 
faculty at that time, but I don't know how many in

01:49.735 --> 01:57.345
experimentation. I'd say 150 at a conservative 
exercise. Was there? I'd say 150 at a conservative

02:00.789 --> 02:03.272
exercise. Well, a faculty, but I don't know how 
many of experimentation and extension service

02:03.533 --> 02:09.561
people. But you see, it was what we now would call a 
small group. In those days, we called it a large

02:13.586 --> 02:15.388
group. But we had a lovely time. And afterwards, 
there would be some short speeches, mostly light

02:17.187 --> 02:23.374
in nature. And then after the dinner, or toward the 
end of the dinner, we would sing Christmas carols

02:23.875 --> 02:31.083
together. And I remember, particularly on one 
occasion, that Mr. Joe directed our singing. And

02:40.647 --> 02:49.917
he was, by the way, the first director of the Cadet 
Singers before they had a professional director.

02:50.598 --> 02:52.720
And Joe Wilk was very fond of music. And they, of 
course, are still here. And let me see. Everybody

02:59.528 --> 03:00.909
had a wonderful time. And we looked forward. We 
practically expected them to do it to us. And then,

03:05.334 --> 03:07.937
in the same vein, And I call that a sort of legacy 
from President Walton. How long did this go on? How

03:15.091 --> 03:15.792
many years? Oh, I remember definitely that it was 
going on in 35, but it went on much longer than that.

03:23.325 --> 03:30.196
It went on to, oh, let me see, when somebody came in. 
When did the Nancys come here? I remember them and

03:32.339 --> 03:33.942
that. And I remember the cigars in that. So that 
was, it must have gone on up until, probably until

03:37.548 --> 03:46.036
President Walton retired. I believe that it went 
on that whole long, long, long period so that I can

03:46.737 --> 03:58.889
differentiate between one of the meetings and 
another one of the meetings, or one of the dinners.

03:59.229 --> 04:02.292
Later, we were served banquet style by plate. And 
that was when it got larger, I think. You see, it

04:05.696 --> 04:08.398
would be simpler to serve it like that. And the 
cadet waiters used to serve us. And we always had a

04:13.522 --> 04:24.692
thank you for the director of subsistence, 
whoever it was, a formal thank you, and for the

04:13.522 --> 04:24.692
cadets who served us. Duncan was director of 
subsistence. What's that? Duncan was director of

04:30.036 --> 04:31.477
subsistence. At that time. was director of 
subsystem. And Spiesa had just, I think, gone off.

04:40.296 --> 04:42.157
Spiesa Hall is named for him. And, of course, 
Duncan Hall is named for Mr. Duncan. How was the

04:46.021 --> 04:47.863
food? Oh, wonderful. Really? Oh, delicious food. 
Oh, they didn't skimp us. They didn't skimp us.

04:56.250 --> 05:03.497
Incidentally, along that very line, there was a 
dining or a meal, no matter what it sounds, At Speza

05:04.439 --> 05:05.580
Hall. Yes, that's where we had it. And one of the 
prominent items on the menu was fresh, roasted and

05:07.722 --> 05:15.309
thin air corn on the cob. Oh, that was at 
summertime. Yeah. And somebody was

05:17.671 --> 05:20.254
congratulating Duncan about it. And he said, 
yeah, that's all right. The boys are having the

05:22.015 --> 05:24.498
same thing today. I was down in Houston looking the 
markets over, and there was quite a bunch of fresh

05:25.098 --> 05:32.185
corn on the market. And I got 32 bushels sealed up 
here. So the bars were not always shorted, you see.

05:40.823 --> 05:44.667
I haven't heard too many complaints about the food 
from that period at all. Most of the people I talked

05:45.288 --> 05:48.832
to would still thought the food was very good. 
Maybe the young men were better trained and better

05:49.533 --> 05:58.042
behaved, perhaps, in that period. But anyway, 
that's when they were still doing hazing. And that

06:01.308 --> 06:04.392
has sort of simmered off, I think. In the same 
connection, there was another gathering of

06:05.333 --> 06:16.828
faculty, and I say faculty, Experiment Station, 
and Extension Service. We were just one group

06:16.868 --> 06:25.459
together when the New Year's reception that 
President and Mrs. Walton gave. I think that is

06:29.165 --> 06:33.572
still being continued, but I'm not sure. They may 
be dividing it, too, because the groups are so much

06:33.652 --> 06:37.858
larger. It may not be one long affair. But that New 
Year's reception, well, we wouldn't have missed

06:40.983 --> 06:45.309
it for anything. Mrs. Walton had the most heavenly 
food you can imagine. And it was so informal. It was

06:51.681 --> 06:53.723
so, we all knew each other. And I remember that on 
one occasion, one of the deans took his napkin and

06:54.344 --> 07:12.787
picked up a few elegant tidbits that Mrs. Walton 
always had and folded up. He was taking this to his

07:13.008 --> 07:17.133
children, so they'd enjoy that part. What name was 
this? What's that? Who was this that did this? Who

07:21.330 --> 07:22.351
was the dean that did it? Oh, should I say that? 
Certainly. Well, it was Dean Winkler. Oh, my.

07:29.762 --> 07:33.067
Well, Dean Winkler was then dean of what was it? 
Education. Education, I think. And we knew them

07:35.711 --> 07:36.993
well, too. He died some years ago. But Mrs. Winkler 
is still living here. I really shouldn't give

07:43.688 --> 07:49.475
names because that was so natural. And so you might 
have done it with family. But that was always

07:53.339 --> 07:57.184
President Walton's motto. We are one family. You 
see, it was a beautiful idea to reiterate. And also

08:05.214 --> 08:08.197
that one cooperation. He used those two phrases a 
good bit. And then they have colored the whole

08:11.301 --> 08:13.223
thing. The whole attitude had something to do with 
it. Only to stress the wrong syllable,

08:16.676 --> 08:19.340
cooperation. Yes, we all do say cooperation. And I 
think we all got to saying and probably having fun.

08:27.354 --> 08:33.143
And then if one copies somebody else, one gets the 
same habit oneself. It's very interesting.

08:39.005 --> 08:39.866
Let me see. There was something I wanted to say 
there about that. But I believe that's all, Mrs.

08:43.351 --> 08:44.973
Walton. Mrs. Walton served elegant meals. We've 
been there to dinner. Oh, wonderful. And Ethel

08:50.401 --> 08:56.630
Burgess is the daughter still living here. And 
little Mrs. M.L. Cashin, Mason Lee Cashin's wife,

09:02.818 --> 09:07.645
is Dr. Walton's granddaughter. He had two sons 
here who are doctors, I think. Dr. Turner Walton

09:11.735 --> 09:15.260
has retired, helped on . And Lee. Yes, and Lee. But 
he has a son who is also practicing now. So you see

09:23.051 --> 09:29.601
they've gone into medical and stayed here, the two 
sons and their sons. And let me see, another social

09:30.422 --> 09:36.771
event was Mrs. Duncan's Halloween party. And 
honestly, when anybody started something like

09:40.200 --> 09:46.049
that, all the rest of us expected it to go on 
forever. It was such a nice, steady feeling we had.

09:49.554 --> 09:54.441
But she gave Halloween parties on Halloween 
night. Now, I think that did not last so long. The

09:58.508 --> 10:01.192
Duncans were already elderly when we came. So I 
think that was a short duration. But I remember

10:03.896 --> 10:05.458
one. Of course, it was her party. It was the Duncans 
gave the party. It was not a college affair. But I

10:11.733 --> 10:29.398
think some, one of the military men in the military 
department, they had a very handsome and charming

10:11.733 --> 10:29.398
secretary, not so young as I remember her, but not 
in the 20s, beyond the 20s, and maybe beyond 30s.

10:30.179 --> 10:32.863
And one of the military people called Mrs. Duncan 
to order because she didn't invite the secretary.

10:39.448 --> 10:41.049
So you see how things were. I don't know whether she 
really did it or not, but she was not obliged to

10:41.370 --> 10:47.316
because it was a private party. Then I don't know 
whether I told you how we used to shop. I heard, this

10:57.647 --> 11:00.150
is secondhand, I heard from the daughter of a long 
ago head of the history department, Professor

11:00.434 --> 11:18.683
Fountain, whose memorial bronze tablet is in the 
YMCA chapel, I believe they call it now. And she

11:20.106 --> 11:23.992
said, she was the one that had the history far, far 
back. And I have heard her talk. So some of these

11:25.735 --> 11:27.758
things. are secondhand from her and from Mrs. 
Camel. Mrs. Camel and Mrs. Cofer. They were

11:34.326 --> 11:51.209
long-time, but not as long time as Mrs. 
Marsteller, who was the fountain, and married

11:34.326 --> 11:51.209
Marsteller, who succeeded Dean Francis as head of 
the veterinary school. She said that when they

11:51.870 --> 11:55.855
lived here, when she was young here, They had to get 
to Bryan with almost a day's journey, because they

11:56.155 --> 12:04.024
had to go by buggy to get their shopping. But there 
was a grocery, and at Northgate, a few, well, there

12:04.044 --> 12:11.493
was a grocery established the year we came. You 
remember Luke's, Luke and Charlie. Very well

12:13.835 --> 12:15.097
known. So much so that everybody went to Luke and 
Charlie. Luke was a prince. He was a prince. Do you

12:19.982 --> 12:22.205
remember their full names? Luke. Patronel. 
Patronel. Patronel. Patronella or Patronello, I

12:25.602 --> 12:30.188
don't know. His widow, Elsie, a very fine woman. 
She had 20 years of widowhood and then married a

12:35.134 --> 12:41.601
retired colonel here who was a fine person. She's 
had two wonderful husbands. And she acted with

12:44.745 --> 12:50.232
dignity and poise through those 20 years, I told 
her that month. And she lives here. Now, Luke's.

12:56.523 --> 12:57.904
But he was the grocer here. But at his funeral, I 
have never seen so sick at heart and so much weeping

12:57.964 --> 13:11.658
as was seen there. I never have. We all loved Luke. 
And he had a- Who was Charlie? Charlie? Charlie

13:20.928 --> 13:22.069
Oversteady. was in business with him in the 
grocery business in Northgate. Then when the

13:26.847 --> 13:44.725
development started across Texas Avenue, when 
Texas Avenue became a road, a street, Luke moved

13:26.847 --> 13:44.725
over there in a new neighborhood and continued his 
business there in his own name, Luke's. But Luke

13:45.806 --> 13:50.250
and Charlie was such a familiar name in the older 
days. before there was any Texas Avenue, that one

13:50.635 --> 14:09.594
child was reported to have said her evening 
prayer, something about Matthew, Mark, Luke, and

13:50.635 --> 14:09.594
John, saying, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Charlie. 
So you see, he was one of us, too, but not, of course,

14:11.556 --> 14:17.622
of the staff. And later, of course, after this 
buggy period, which we didn't know anything

14:18.209 --> 14:28.384
about, there were a lot of new high cars. You know, 
they all had so much at the top, especially the

14:28.404 --> 14:33.592
Fords, I think. And we came down with the A, what was 
ours? Max. Maxwell. And then we would go to town by

14:39.621 --> 14:43.227
car. What road did you take to town? Oh, College 
Road. That's all there was. We didn't have

14:49.746 --> 14:51.107
anything else. What was the condition of the road? 
Could you describe it? Well, it was like any old

14:53.209 --> 14:56.172
road would be. Nothing gray on. It was not paved or 
was paved? Pretty primitive, I would say. No, it

15:01.838 --> 15:02.919
was not paved. It was not paved. Oh, it was not 
paved, no. Not even gravel. Yeah, gravel. But it

15:09.225 --> 15:11.287
was passable. We never had any trouble going in 
there. And how long did it take you? Can you

15:16.238 --> 15:23.425
remember how long it took you to get, say, from your 
house to downtown Bryan, to the shopping

15:16.238 --> 15:23.425
district?

15:23.585 --> 15:24.286
I don't know. 12, 15 minutes. Oh, now we can get 
anywhere in 10, 15 minutes. Now, certainly. But I

15:28.130 --> 15:28.890
was wondering when. No, it must have been half an 
hour or so to get down there, I imagine. And we had

15:33.195 --> 15:36.298
just this little one grocery on the campus. And of 
course, it was not stocked as well as the several

15:36.318 --> 15:44.005
ANPs and so on in town. Of course, just, we, I think 
it was here, or they started shortly after we came,

15:44.221 --> 16:02.533
the interurban, which ran from, did it start from 
old Aggieland Inn, or more to Northgate? More from

16:03.475 --> 16:04.497
the gate, I think. More, it was more Northgate, 
what we now call Northgate. There was an

16:08.487 --> 16:18.117
interurban that rode into town, and where it 
stopped in town, or where the station wasn't down,

16:08.487 --> 16:18.117
I can't remember, because we didn't use it except 
in emergency. And it came right through Cabot

16:18.477 --> 16:23.382
Street, which is now Cabot Street. In fact, some 
people living over there near Cabot here in North

16:23.762 --> 16:36.655
Oakwood used the end of that paving ramp on tracks 
as their driveway. You can see. I can see that it is

16:37.818 --> 16:40.541
the remains of the old road. Then, of course, they 
changed to buses. And that's modern. So you don't

16:46.768 --> 16:48.610
want to know about anything modern. How often did 
the interurban run? How often? How often was the

16:52.194 --> 16:54.036
schedule of the interurban? How often did a car 
come and go? I can't remember. Near as I can

16:56.319 --> 16:58.421
remember, about every quarter hour. Quarter 
hour? Was it that often? How was it powered? Was it

17:00.984 --> 17:03.727
electric or diesel or? Overhead. I think it was an 
overhead trolley. It was a streetcar. But we've

17:11.976 --> 17:13.818
always called it a streetcar. And I don't know how 
many are left. But there's some still left in. Oh,

17:19.144 --> 17:21.006
there are buses up there in New York. San Francisco 
still has a lot, I think. 42nd Street. Leading to

17:25.390 --> 17:34.840
that, from that, or rather from the, I should say, 
that a

17:35.140 --> 17:49.033
continuation of the family relationship of the 
employees, faculty, and so forth, at the college.

17:49.454 --> 18:02.406
There is now a A&M retirees club, which means if 
you're retired, you're eligible. And of course,

18:02.426 --> 18:03.747
not all go. But we have a president, we have a 
secretary, and who reads the minutes, and we have a

18:04.132 --> 18:14.447
treasurer. We have no constitution, no bylaws, no 
anything to break. Very informal. We can't break

18:20.996 --> 18:25.021
any constitution or bylaws or anything. We just 
meet. Do you know when this first started? Oh, that

18:29.408 --> 18:32.552
may have been as long as 10 years ago. But it's not an 
old thing. Carnegie came in 56. No, it may have been

18:39.018 --> 18:42.281
started in 60. Maybe in there somewhere. Because I 
remember who was working it up. That was Mr.

18:47.646 --> 18:50.268
Carnegie, who came here. He was in the insurance 
business. And then he came in here and taught a few

18:54.632 --> 18:56.654
years. And that made him a retired professor. 
Where did he teach? What department? That's

19:01.793 --> 19:02.394
right. What department did he teach in? I think in 
business administration.

19:08.904 --> 19:14.733
But I'm not quite sure, because we're just a few 
years, and we've had a number of people come in like

19:08.904 --> 19:14.733
that, retiring. I'll tell you. Oh, I could mention 
their names, but it's so recent.

19:22.305 --> 19:28.054
We had a number that would come in, especially in 
the Army, would come in and teach some years and

19:22.305 --> 19:28.054
then be retired. here, you see. And they usually 
stayed here, like we do. That's a nice place. See,

19:32.698 --> 19:33.740
we can't get away from this place. That's a nice 
place. And we, for years, thought we'd retire up to

19:34.861 --> 19:40.708
Virginia to raise various properties up there. 
But we can't get away from this place. That's all

19:43.952 --> 19:44.913
there's to it. And let me see. So that retirees 
club, we meet about four or five times a year. I

19:54.064 --> 19:56.927
think it's supposed to be four times. have no 
constitution or bylaws or anything. So we just do

20:00.162 --> 20:01.483
what we want to. And we meet and pay for our dinners. 
We've gone to Haldi Inn. We've gone to Wyatt's.

20:11.033 --> 20:12.474
We've gone to the Ramada. We've gone out to the 
college memorial center. We get a notion we want

20:17.019 --> 20:19.642
change. Well, then we change. And there's nothing 
that says we can't. We just vote. And we are about,

20:23.468 --> 20:26.891
the attendance is about 110. So it kind of, that I 
think, or thereabouts. And that crowds us pretty

20:32.816 --> 20:35.959
much in some places. So we've had to make moves 
there. But that's lots of fun. We all love each

20:40.142 --> 20:41.103
other. Because we're all so old. Well, you get a 
chance to see a lot of people, I guess, at this that

20:42.944 --> 20:47.048
you don't get to see very often. We're sort of 
mellowed, you might say. So we all love each other.

20:53.438 --> 20:57.964
There was an old entertainment. There was Guyon 
Hall. Do you know anything about Guyon Hall? It was

21:01.388 --> 21:02.590
here when I was here. But there was a fault in the 
construction there. So I think that it hasn't

21:05.713 --> 21:09.258
lasted. We lived right at the back of that Guyon 
Hall. And what is now a parking lot, or I think it

21:14.845 --> 21:19.351
still is. They make so many changes out there, you 
can tell. It's a parking lot. a parking lot by the

21:22.244 --> 21:25.990
Raleigh White. Yes, and directly behind the new 
Rutter Center that they built over where G.

21:26.010 --> 21:30.897
Raleigh was. Well, don't tell me about that. I 
don't want to get lost again. Well, right where G.

21:35.865 --> 21:38.869
Raleigh, right where Guy in Hall was, they built 
this new complex. Oh, they did. The tower, I think,

21:43.316 --> 21:46.259
where they have a restaurant on top. I never could 
understand why you had to go all the way up on the top

21:46.320 --> 21:50.604
of something to a restaurant. But we did it in the 
Europa Hotel in Copenhagen, remember? I think I

21:54.208 --> 21:55.089
did. Rosebuds strewn all over the table for us. We 
asked for a table for several. This is extraneous.

22:07.482 --> 22:08.923
This is a point. little boy of five or six said when 
we took him to the circus, he said, why do they have

22:09.224 --> 22:16.073
to swing way up there? Why can't they swing down 
here? So we have a practical point of view here.

22:24.044 --> 22:32.376
There was the cat a corner, approximately cat a 
corner, from the present YMCA building. Only in

22:32.736 --> 22:35.861
those days, it didn't have the solariums on it. It 
was just a narrower building. And all our

22:37.844 --> 22:46.319
meetings, our women's clubs, and study clubs, and 
garden clubs, and things like that, always met

22:37.844 --> 22:46.319
there. We didn't have the facilities that now 
exist with the Memorial Center then. And later, we

22:52.811 --> 22:56.057
did meet at the Memorial Center. Our women's 
organization, faculty-wise,

23:02.515 --> 23:04.778
the study clubs, and the social club. We had the 
social club. I believe I told you about the social

23:05.939 --> 23:08.202
club. It was organized mainly to look after the 
cadets, the boys who stayed, who couldn't get home

23:08.583 --> 23:15.651
for Christmas. But we all went to it and took our 
children, and it was a very family time. Do you have

23:23.201 --> 23:25.904
any idea how old the women's social club is? When it 
began, maybe? It was in existence when we came.

23:32.097 --> 23:34.641
That's about as much as I can tell. And the campus 
club was in existence. I remember being invited to

23:36.784 --> 23:38.366
it. What's the campus club? The campus study club. 
Oh, the campus club. Yeah, I remember being

23:43.333 --> 23:45.757
invited to it the first year we were here. And it 
still exists. And I think they have a historian. I

23:51.625 --> 23:59.597
think the historian is Mrs.

23:51.625 --> 23:59.597
Marie Ashton. Marie Ashton, Mrs. Ashton. And she 
might be able to tell you more of that if you wanted

24:02.590 --> 24:06.354
it. But as I said, we used to meet at the Y. And then, 
again, about these old buildings, almost cat a

24:08.917 --> 24:16.586
corner from the Y. As it now stands, it's one of the 
old buildings. And it was here when we came. It was

24:23.975 --> 24:31.804
an old sort of barn-like structure that I think 
they called it Assembly Hall, but I'm not quite

24:23.975 --> 24:31.804
sure. because there would be some assemblies 
there when we became uncertain about Guyon Hall.

24:41.017 --> 24:47.005
And by the way, in Guyon Hall, there were no 
churches as such. There were the Presbyterian

24:47.505 --> 24:52.251
group, the Methodist group, the Baptist group. 
Have you heard about that? No, I haven't. Well, you

24:54.174 --> 24:57.218
see, it was small. And there was not

24:57.738 --> 25:09.435
enough

24:57.738 --> 25:09.435
people to make a charter group and do it. But after a 
while, we became established as churches. Was it

25:13.921 --> 25:16.665
too far to go to Bryan, then? In other words, you 
could have gone to church at Bryan. No, but most of

25:18.608 --> 25:20.711
us didn't. College stayed pretty much to itself. 
Local patriotism. Yes, I think it was a sense of

25:24.485 --> 25:29.370
chauvinistic patriotism, I think. But in the 
basement of Gone Hall, I don't know why they dared

25:30.030 --> 25:38.178
let us be there, but I think it was the upper 
structure that was dangerous. In the basement,

25:38.819 --> 25:42.582
there was a Union Sunday School. And I think Mrs. 
Campbell and Mrs. Marsteller started that, and it

25:43.804 --> 25:52.652
was in existence when we came. And I taught there 
five years for a group of boys who are now

25:53.358 --> 26:00.725
middle-aged men. And the sons, and it was the sons, 
the boys class I had. And we met there and sang there

26:05.950 --> 26:13.297
and had the only Sunday school. Then they had 
somebody established a little later. That was

26:17.281 --> 26:19.003
Mrs. Carper. And I think Mrs. Carper and I can't 
remember who else. established a youth meeting, a

26:23.598 --> 26:33.029
youth vespers, which I was asked to take part in. I 
could tell you some amusing incidents there, but

26:33.109 --> 26:37.274
they're largely about the children. But 
Catacorner, again, I'll get back with that old

26:38.655 --> 26:45.403
sort of barn-like structure where movies were 
shown. I can't remember whether Wednesdays and

26:45.704 --> 26:49.508
Saturdays. I can't remember. I think so, but I 
can't remember. Because Wednesday was an off

26:52.092 --> 26:55.295
night for the students. I don't know if it is now. 
Yeah, it is for military. It's not for the students

27:00.201 --> 27:01.923
anymore, I think. This is the old church night, 
Wednesday night. Wednesday night was an off night

27:04.466 --> 27:08.251
for the... I think they showed the movies then. I 
know our elder son... went to it and I believe Sam

27:14.122 --> 27:43.538
Ray later and we've gone to the movies there then 
and that's right I think where it's to the to the

27:14.122 --> 27:43.538
east is it east gate that comes over here to 
University what's now University Drive what was

27:14.122 --> 27:43.538
it then Old Sulphur Springs Road or something like 
that and Yes,

27:43.889 --> 27:51.240
I've got a note to that. Then I believe that the name 
of the dormitory now standing near there is Pereer

27:51.681 --> 28:02.758
Hall, but I can't remember all those names now. But 
that was after old sweet Dean Pereer. And if you

28:08.447 --> 28:11.191
asked me his first name, I could not tell you. Could 
you? He was from Virginia, so he was... His name was

28:13.336 --> 28:17.081
Charles, but I cannot be certain. No, Pereira. But 
he was a sweet elderly to old gentleman when we

28:18.984 --> 28:26.173
came. And he lived over there on Quality Row and was 
a bachelor, was he not? Yeah. And he died not long

28:35.886 --> 28:38.710
after we came. But while our children were 
small... And we lived in that corner house. And

28:44.347 --> 28:52.518
Bolton lived next to us by one house, Dean and Mrs. 
Bolton. Bolton later became president on what

28:53.760 --> 28:58.746
they called Quality Row. That was named long 
before we ever came. He used to come down, used to

29:03.152 --> 29:08.299
live on Quality Row, and turn the corner and come 
down on our side street. And as he passed, the homes

29:11.605 --> 29:22.776
where there were young boys not going to school, 
and maybe girls too, young girls, before

29:11.605 --> 29:22.776
preschool age. He'd come along, and they'd all 
come rushing over to him to be weighed. So he would

29:28.321 --> 29:31.044
hold his cane up for them. They would grab hold of 
the cane, and he would lift it, and he would tell

29:31.304 --> 29:36.789
them their weight. So you see how family-like the 
whole thing was. Dean Pereira, I just know him as a

29:40.968 --> 29:48.777
fine and scholarly gentleman. Was he once head of 
the math? I think so, yeah. I think he was. Then

29:53.302 --> 30:03.413
there's, let me see, is there anything else I can 
tell about that? Except to emphasize the

30:04.174 --> 30:08.899
family-like character of the whole small campus, 
because we didn't have any huge buildings. We

30:15.705 --> 30:19.108
didn't even want them, I think. And the campus now 
seems strange to many of us. I've heard several

30:23.052 --> 30:25.074
say, oh, I'll never go near it. But we went to the 
campus once by mistake, and we got lost. And then we

30:33.703 --> 30:38.127
found where we once had lived, but there's so many 
one-way streets. that we got off on other streets

30:38.444 --> 30:42.588
before. But we managed to get home. And you see, we 
now are. So what else is there? Can you think of any

30:48.575 --> 30:50.617
questions you'd like to ask? No, I might like to 
have you describe your experiences with Dr. Mark

30:51.438 --> 30:56.623
Francis, possibly. Oh, Dr. Mark Francis. He lived 
on our side street just a half a block down. And I

31:03.891 --> 31:06.814
knew Mrs. Francis very well. In fact, she had gone 
with me several times to Houston. Later, we went to

31:12.877 --> 31:15.639
Houston to shop. Now, that would be in the late 40s, 
somewhere in the late 40s. I mean, not our ages, but

31:22.365 --> 31:25.328
the late 40s chronologically. And she was half shy 
and half full of fun. a person, quite a person

31:36.578 --> 31:46.336
herself, but not the personality that her husband 
Mark Francis was. In fact, there are many stories

31:46.416 --> 31:52.366
about him going about, some of which we heard. He 
died while we still lived on the campus. So that was

31:56.594 --> 32:00.561
in the 30s, you see, somewhere in there. But he was 
retired, lived as a retired man, and it hurt him

32:00.878 --> 32:06.546
very much to be retired. I remember that. He was 
fussing a good bit about being retired. And then

32:11.012 --> 32:23.089
his next in line, Dr. Marsteller, stepped up to be 
head of the veterinary school, dean of the

32:11.012 --> 32:23.089
veterinary school. Dean Francis, I know we went 
over calling very promptly that Sunday morning

32:23.862 --> 32:37.857
when we heard that he had died and

32:23.862 --> 32:37.857
saw Mrs. Francis. She was willing to see us. But one 
of the stories that I remember told all around was

32:41.160 --> 32:51.591
that he would make a regular tour of the campus and 
pick up all the discarded bottles. What the

32:55.211 --> 32:59.936
bottles had been used for before, I leave to your 
imagination. Because I think it was in

33:00.276 --> 33:06.143
Prohibition times. But there were still bottles 
lying around. And they were a disgrace to his soul,

33:08.866 --> 33:11.429
I think. So he picked them up. And when he died, they 
found the servant house just full. of bottles. I

33:19.019 --> 33:20.382
don't know what they did with them. He didn't know 
what to do with them, so he parked them in his

33:20.442 --> 33:23.146
certain house. In his certain house. But it was 
told with great delight about him and pleasure,

33:25.069 --> 33:30.677
you see. It was just nice of him. He was

33:33.802 --> 33:39.451
kind of matter of fact. And I do know some stories, 
which I'm not sure should go on tape, very mild

33:39.832 --> 33:45.861
ones. Ray may know some others that definitely 
should not go on tape or be deleted. I can't think of

33:51.757 --> 33:55.300
any right now that I dare say they were something. 
Well, do you want me to tell you that one about the

33:55.320 --> 33:57.783
chief? Well, he said, now the girls used to pout. 
That's when the skirts became shorter and

34:02.467 --> 34:04.869
shorter. And he said, and that must have been in his 
last years somewhere in... 30s maybe early 30s I

34:14.309 --> 34:38.950
can't remember when he died um the year I mean uh and 
he said that the girls now are are rouging their

34:14.309 --> 34:38.950
cheeks now with the skirts getting shorter all the 
time they'll have to rouge their other cheeks so

34:14.309 --> 34:38.950
that's that's the only one that I know about him 
except that he was um He was always, always a

34:39.385 --> 34:42.930
character. And I said, oh, yes, let me tell you this 
one. He was off on a trip once by train. We had trains

34:51.884 --> 34:53.346
in those days. And he was off on a train trip, and 
Mrs. Francis expected him home on the night train.

35:02.660 --> 35:07.047
I think it came around 12 o'clock at night and was in 
bed. And but she left the door unlocked. And we

35:09.734 --> 35:11.676
always left our doors unlocked. We just could go to 
Brian and not think of locking up our house. But how

35:15.242 --> 35:17.144
different it is now. And she had left the door 
unlocked. And someone, she heard a bang, bang,

35:21.631 --> 35:25.577
banging. And I'm not quite sure we had doorbells, 
did we? I can't remember. Those were campus houses

35:31.405 --> 35:33.588
we lived in. I can tell you a little bit about that if 
you'd like to know. and somebody banged and she

35:36.693 --> 36:05.367
said come in I have the door unlocked come in and the 
banging kept on and she said come in you old fool and

35:36.693 --> 36:05.367
he still banged away so she went to the door and 
found it was a stranger had seen a light and wanted

35:36.693 --> 36:05.367
his way and then of course a little bit later a few 
moments later Dr. Francis himself came And they

36:05.870 --> 36:09.293
were very sort of matter of fact. And I remember one 
time after I brought her back from a Houston trip.

36:18.002 --> 36:19.904
That must have been way back then, the 32. I call 
that way back. And no, wait a minute. No, it was

36:23.848 --> 36:25.049
later than that. But anyway, I brought her back 
from Houston. And they all thought I was a pretty

36:28.652 --> 36:32.356
good driver. So some of the women going to Houston, 
that was in the late late 30s, before we built. And

36:37.713 --> 36:54.380
many of us had to go down to get the hardware and 
things like that, to select hardware and things

36:37.713 --> 36:54.380
like that for the homes that we were building when 
the campus was cleared of faculty homes, except

36:37.713 --> 36:54.380
the president, and maybe some others. I don't 
know.

36:58.132 --> 37:25.472
I remember that some one of the ladies asked me 
would I please take over she didn't mind driving a

36:58.132 --> 37:25.472
road but would I please take over when we got into 
Houston itself because she didn't like to drive in

36:58.132 --> 37:25.472
traffic which didn't bother me and uh they and 
we're about the same age by the way and uh as I said I

36:58.132 --> 37:25.472
was taking Mrs. Francis home uh and some others 
from the from the campus, whom I've invited to go

37:25.942 --> 37:30.867
along for shopping. And Bryan didn't have all the 
stores that it now has, even back there 30 years

37:31.748 --> 37:38.555
ago. And so when we drove up to approaching her 
house, here was Dr. Francis, the undemonstrative

37:39.376 --> 37:53.190
Dr. Francis, walking back and forth on the 
pavement. We did have a few pavements, didn't we?

37:55.793 --> 37:58.916
But usually there weren't any pavements or walks. 
We just traipsed over everything. And he was

38:01.098 --> 38:06.102
walking back and forth and back and forth. And I 
told Mrs. Francis, I said, see, you see, he is

38:06.122 --> 38:13.349
worried to death about your coming home so late. 
And of course, it wasn't very late because we

38:13.689 --> 38:16.772
wouldn't drive that late. And she was more like a 
young girl being courted. And she accepted that.

38:25.662 --> 38:29.968
that interpretation of his walking back and 
forth. The houses. The

38:31.910 --> 38:38.078
houses that we had were campus houses. When we came 
to ours, I think it was 12 years old. But they were

38:41.924 --> 38:45.168
very flimsily constructed. So the windows and the 
doors didn't fit very tightly. So it wouldn't have

38:48.853 --> 38:54.420
been done in these days of energy and fuel 
shortages because we had winter winds when we

38:54.586 --> 39:01.876
didn't want them and summer heat when we didn't 
want it. And of course, there was no, we didn't have

39:01.896 --> 39:06.223
air conditioning and things like that. But we did 
have, and we had wood stoves, wood and coal stoves

39:06.703 --> 39:11.650
when we first came. And then gas was put in when? A 
few years after we came. In the 30s, I think. It was

39:20.102 --> 39:24.188
in the late 20s because Thompson came to see us and 
we had just gotten there. And I think that must have

39:24.539 --> 39:28.203
been before we went to visit him. So it must have 
been in the late 20s. I bet you were glad to get that

39:30.445 --> 39:32.408
gas stove. That's what? I bet you were glad to get 
that gas stove. Oh, it was wonderful. We had a

39:36.892 --> 39:40.877
friend visiting us at that time, and he was just as 
happy as we were. An old family friend of ours who

39:41.357 --> 39:46.683
was more like an uncle to us girls. But the houses 
were very flimsy. Ours was painted green, and

39:49.286 --> 39:52.129
everybody else's was white. So we felt... We live 
in the greenhouse, not the white house. And I can

39:57.218 --> 40:01.264
tell you one incident about it. Our young son, 
who's now in the State Department, when he was, oh,

40:01.504 --> 40:15.242
I suppose, four, five, something like that, he was 
just a year old when we came here. And he was in

40:15.963 --> 40:23.132
Sunday school, and he must have been judging by 
the... The lesson, as it was given, he must have

40:23.517 --> 40:31.425
been about four or five, enough to understand that 
one must be grateful and thankful for God's good

40:23.517 --> 40:31.425
gifts. And the teacher, I can tell you her name, 
told them, now what must we be thankful for? Our

40:40.053 --> 40:48.642
parents, our good health, the sunshine, the rain, 
the flowers, the grass, the homes we live in. And

40:48.682 --> 40:52.225
our young son piped up and says, My dad says that our 
home is a shack. So that would indicate that they

40:56.735 --> 41:00.519
were rather flimsily built. So I think it was that 
we were all upset. Not exactly upset, but we were

41:05.825 --> 41:18.460
all sort of alert and tense about moving and 
building our own houses after we had lived in $18

41:05.825 --> 41:18.460
and $20 a month homes on the campus. It was so 
convenient. Oh, you did have to pay rent for these

41:19.582 --> 41:21.424
houses. Yes, we paid rent. I think ours was $18 a 
month when we came. Yes, when we first came. And the

41:27.469 --> 41:40.467
houses were on the campus were allotted to rank and 
seniority determined who would get the houses. So

41:40.507 --> 41:46.295
you see, the houses at one time on the campus must 
have taken care of the whole faculty. Now, how many

41:46.716 --> 41:49.920
there were, 150?

41:51.520 --> 41:58.570
But anyway, just about in there, they began 
spreading subdivisions. And Dr. F.B. Clark, whom

42:00.292 --> 42:10.626
I knew at Johns Hopkins, where he got his doctor's 
degree before Ray came and got his degree there,

42:00.292 --> 42:10.626
too. He bought tracts of land to the south of 
college. I think he called it Kaskaskia

42:15.444 --> 42:17.707
Properties. I don't know why he gave that name. And 
so that was the first development. College Park, I

42:23.213 --> 42:25.536
believe they called it. Yes, College Park. And 
that built up slowly. The guy,

42:30.742 --> 42:35.508
of course, the Clarks built. They had a little log 
cabin that they lived in first. And later that was

42:39.749 --> 42:45.918
the home of Mrs. Clark's sister, Ms. Haynes, who 
was quite an artist. She's still there. Marie

42:49.843 --> 42:50.624
Haynes. And she, in late life, she married Fred 
Burt of the, was it chemistry or mathematics?

42:59.076 --> 42:59.677
Yeah, I think. Stafford moved to Vermont. And I 
don't know, I've often wondered, because we knew

43:03.695 --> 43:10.222
them extremely well. In fact, Dr. Clark and Ray, 
Dr. Gammon, had talked to us. So, and I had known him

43:18.030 --> 43:30.003
at Hopkins, so they were our first callers, and so 
were, among the first four, were the Clarks and the

43:18.030 --> 43:30.003
Boltons. We had, in coming out here, We had come 
through northern Mississippi and part of the

43:32.922 --> 43:38.631
distance. And somebody passed us in a car and 
tooted at us. And I didn't know what it was. I

43:49.187 --> 43:50.789
thought maybe there was something wrong. But then 
we saw that they had a Texas license. So they were

43:54.355 --> 43:56.919
just tooting for a Texas license. We used to do 
things like that when we traveled. Back there in

43:59.939 --> 44:04.524
the 20s and 30s, late 20s and 30s. And then even 
later, I mean, recognized the Texas license. And

44:09.810 --> 44:13.413
then above that was A&MC. So I knew that they were 
from A&M. And we were coming back to Sherman to pick

44:18.339 --> 44:23.404
up our belongings and move down here. And so we 
passed them and tooted for them, and they stopped.

44:29.335 --> 44:35.344
And I just said, we are coming to A&M in September. 
And so they introduced themselves and apologized

44:36.065 --> 44:48.724
for their looks, because they wore, in those days, 
these dust coats and dust hats and things. And they

44:48.985 --> 44:53.031
were going to their own home, Pontotoc, 
Mississippi. And then when we had come in, we

44:53.692 --> 44:57.958
stayed at the old Agulon Inn. Not the one they built 
out there on Texas Avenue called Eglin Inn. But

45:02.558 --> 45:08.064
that is a cat corner from the College Station post 
office. Cat corner to... It's been torn down now.

45:12.248 --> 45:13.049
Oh, yes, I know it is. It's not there anymore. Well, 
we stayed there, and some were rather... Dean

45:13.609 --> 45:23.419
Friley, who was dean of the academic... Arts and 
Sciences. Arts and Sciences. And he was not there.

45:27.245 --> 45:33.173
He had asked Dr. Summey or the Summeys to call on us. 
So they were early callers. And Dr. Summey came and

45:36.798 --> 45:41.163
called on us while we were still at the Eglin Inn. We 
stayed there a couple of nights until some of our

45:41.203 --> 45:45.249
furniture should come down. And I remember some 
were so amazed that we just didn't put mattresses

45:45.889 --> 45:54.000
on the floor to sleep in our house. We were not 
accustomed. We always were pretty careful where

45:55.540 --> 45:58.125
we stopped. But anyway, that's the house. 
Anything else you can think of? People? No, not

46:04.797 --> 46:06.040
right off. I mean, let me think a minute here. I've 
got to turn this tape over anyway.
