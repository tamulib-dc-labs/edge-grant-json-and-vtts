00:01.448 --> 00:02.589
During the First World War. Right. And when the 
SATC was in operation there. And sneered at those

00:10.677 --> 00:31.118
of us who were not in uniform, like me, who was an 
instructor, and I was told that I had to remain,

00:10.677 --> 00:31.118
that the college had to carry on, classes had to be 
held as they had been held before the war. And I took

00:31.553 --> 00:39.562
it as long as I could, so I went back into service. So 
you gave up your teaching job there for the time

00:40.523 --> 00:44.006
being. Yeah. Where did you go into service? 
Louisville, Kentucky. I went into the artillery.

00:58.482 --> 01:00.244
And I stayed there. Would have gotten my own 
commission, but during the last month of my time in

01:01.118 --> 01:12.913
Louisville, Kentucky, war ended and said they 
wanted to know why I stayed here. So I packed up and

01:13.133 --> 01:19.221
came home and attended Texas. I mean, came back, 
took my old job.

01:25.689 --> 01:30.535
You were starting to say you had an interesting 
experience during the war.

01:31.240 --> 01:39.111
In other words, in 1917, when all of them were going 
in, I was going to go in too, you see, with the rest of

01:31.240 --> 01:39.111
them. Dr. Bezell said no, that I'd stay. So I 
stayed. And of course, I was...

01:47.744 --> 01:53.252
And they drafted me. And I went in then as a draftee 
from this area. And... Of course, as a draftee, I

02:01.767 --> 02:07.034
became first sergeant of the company there.

02:10.298 --> 02:22.312
I was there from September until December when 
orders came that I was to be discharged.

02:22.413 --> 02:30.002
I was discharged for being erroneously inducted 
into military service.

02:30.725 --> 02:43.024
Then after I'd been there that period of time, I 
went back to A&M again, to my old job. And that's

02:44.786 --> 02:59.128
when SATC was sneering and spitting at these boys, 
and I decided I couldn't take it, so I went to the

02:44.786 --> 02:59.128
field artillery. F-A-C-O-T-S, Field Artillery.

03:07.058 --> 03:10.063
That was the initials of this company.

03:14.109 --> 03:15.632
Then of course I was there Until about the time I was 
to receive my commission, when I just checked out.

03:24.930 --> 03:27.834
That ended my war service. So I have two 
discharges, one on them and one just a discharge.

03:36.064 --> 03:38.346
Because you were erroneously inducted. 
Erroneously inducted in the military service. I

03:40.169 --> 03:44.133
imagine there are not very many people who have two 
discharges from World War I. No. I actually had

03:44.992 --> 03:46.533
three. I had one in the National Guard. I joined the 
National Guard after I come back. You say you

03:52.339 --> 03:54.000
joined after you came back? From World War I. 
Uh-huh. How long were you in the National Guard

03:56.943 --> 03:58.465
then? I don't know just how long. About a couple of 
years, I imagine, then we disbanded. And you were

04:04.891 --> 04:08.174
in the National Guard then in Bryan and College 
Station? Right.

04:11.737 --> 04:11.877
Uh-huh.

04:17.864 --> 04:26.473
At

04:17.864 --> 04:26.473
one point, I believe you were named as a 
distinguished student from Texas A&M. Yeah. Was

04:28.595 --> 04:31.098
that a fairly high honor for you to receive? It was. 
That was in recognition of what, your

04:33.400 --> 04:37.804
contribution to teaching?

04:39.827 --> 04:46.133
Well, my contribution as a student.

04:52.475 --> 04:58.724
Now, you didn't have reference to this honorary 
degree I got. No, this was the Association of

04:59.064 --> 05:05.774
Former Students at Texas A&M named you a 
distinguished alumnus. It was, well, I've

05:05.794 --> 05:08.297
forgotten exactly how many years ago. See, I was 
president of that association, you know, and it

05:10.180 --> 05:21.115
was the largest organization on the campus.

05:24.301 --> 05:26.985
Now, you were president of the Alumni 
Association? I was president of the Student

05:28.407 --> 05:33.075
Organization.

05:36.660 --> 05:40.887
Scientific Agricultural Association. I think 
that's what it was called. You get that from the

05:43.050 --> 05:51.844
annual, but that's what it was called. What I had 
reference to was something which the Former

05:52.162 --> 06:07.181
Students Association at Texas A&M awarded you a 
certificate as a distinguished alumnus. This

06:07.962 --> 06:12.648
would have been while you were teaching here at 
Tech.

06:12.668 --> 06:14.410
No. I thought you had received one of those. No. No, 
I haven't. I

06:21.710 --> 06:32.847
received an

06:21.710 --> 06:32.847
honorary doctorate degree. That was from whom? 
Texas A&M. Texas A&M? Yeah. When did you receive

06:37.474 --> 06:38.436
that? In 56 or 57, somewhere. Of course, that's the 
highest degree I could receive from A&M. of which

06:52.068 --> 06:55.212
I'm, of course, very proud. Up to that time, I was 
called a degree I.N. I got a bachelor's here, a

07:00.038 --> 07:07.989
master's today at Missouri, and then I got this 
honorary doctorate from Texas A&M.

07:13.236 --> 07:14.177
Okay.
