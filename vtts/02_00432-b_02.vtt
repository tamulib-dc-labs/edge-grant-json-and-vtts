WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:13.000
Who the other general officers were, he took to 
Africa with him, but I know that Delmar Dutton was

00:01.550 --> 00:13.000
my immediate commanding general. Now, were you in 
at all on the planning of the invasion of North

00:13.020 --> 00:20.227
Africa, Operation Torch? I was in on the planning 
for the supply maintenance. Part of it. Part of it.

00:25.552 --> 00:28.775
In fact, I did all the thickness shovel work on 
that. I had an awful time. The telephone system in

00:32.566 --> 00:36.512
England was horrible. It was so bad that I 
appointed my brightest, best lieutenant to do

00:37.314 --> 00:45.647
nothing but get me telephone numbers. I called in 
all over England trying to get a hold of these

00:46.388 --> 00:52.498
people and tell them what to do.

00:54.132 --> 00:58.836
I couldn't spend all my time trying to get a number, 
trying to get a line through. It was horrible. So as

01:00.217 --> 01:06.763
far as supply and maintenance, was that the 
biggest problem, or were there other large

01:00.217 --> 01:06.763
problems? That was the only problem I had, and I was

01:06.783 --> 01:16.951
the man that had to put it on. I

01:16.971 --> 01:23.937
had some pretty good help. Did you get enough 
supplies? Yeah, we got everybody fixed up. We

01:31.284 --> 01:34.088
didn't actually have enough transportation. We 
were always short of transportation, Jeeps and

01:34.148 --> 01:37.493
trucks. Down in Africa, we were still short. 
Sicily was short. What about aircraft? Did you

01:46.206 --> 01:47.768
have enough aircraft? I wasn't worried about the 
aircraft because that wasn't part of my business.

01:55.270 --> 02:05.243
They had lost quite a number of C-47s in the landing 
in Algiers.

02:05.263 --> 02:11.731
They went on there with paratroopers and knights, 
you know, and they landed all over the place. Lost

02:13.554 --> 02:24.568
quite a number of aircraft, but that wasn't my, 
that wasn't my, my job was parts, supply parts,

02:13.554 --> 02:24.568
gasoline. and

02:25.730 --> 02:35.719
maintenance crews, depot crews,

02:25.730 --> 02:35.719
and so forth. Did you get enough gasoline to them? 
Get enough what? Gasoline. Yeah, it came in a 55

02:40.123 --> 02:55.077
gallon drum, and some of it came in a 5 gallon jerry 
can, as they called them. I had a Gasoline dumps

02:55.987 --> 03:00.473
several different places around North Africa. 
The enemy had come over and dropped a few

03:02.715 --> 03:09.824
incendiary bombs while they could burn up a lot of 
gasoline, but they didn't do it.

03:12.968 --> 03:14.230
They didn't know where they were located? I don't 
know why they, I never could figure out why they did

03:14.250 --> 03:19.757
this and that. When did you land in North Africa? Me 
personally? I think it was 18th of November. I

03:29.867 --> 03:32.571
think the invasion was the 11th of November. So you 
came about a week later. Yeah. I went down by

03:36.295 --> 03:46.929
C-47 Flying Fortress back in the bomb 
compartment. What were your feelings about

03:48.070 --> 03:51.495
finally getting into the War Theater? Well, I was 
glad to get there. I was so happy to get out of

03:56.197 --> 04:02.944
Washington, and anywhere would have been 
alright. Now, when you got down to Altiers and

04:05.066 --> 04:19.781
North Africa, one of the major questions was if the 
French were going to, how the French in North

04:05.066 --> 04:19.781
Africa were going to react. Yeah, and I lost a good 
friend, Lieutenant Cross, C-R-E-W. I guess he was

04:27.922 --> 04:29.964
a colonel at that time. He could speak French. I 
know at Casablanca was where the French were

04:33.748 --> 04:37.132
concentrated. And I guess he volunteered. He 
said, I can speak French. Let me go ashore and talk

04:43.319 --> 04:45.041
to him. He walked ashore, and the French, some 
trigger-happy Frenchman shot him and killed him.

04:55.532 --> 04:57.034
He never did get to talk to him. But the French 
capitulated right away. Yeah. And did they fight

05:05.039 --> 05:08.464
with you? Of course, De Gaulle went down. Oh, I 
don't know. I guess there were some French units in

05:14.232 --> 05:21.061
Eisenhower's, in Eisenhower's down in Africa at 
that time. Sure, yeah. I think he may have had some

05:22.163 --> 05:25.006
French units in his command. Did you ever get to see 
De Gaulle? No. And, of course, and Eisenhower was

05:29.802 --> 05:32.706
down there at that time, did you? I saw a picture in 
there with you and Eisenhower. Yeah, well, I

05:35.651 --> 05:37.373
didn't know him then. Oh, okay. Well, when did you 
meet the general? I may have met him in London when

05:42.641 --> 05:50.733
we were laying on the invasion, but I'm not sure. 
But those pictures were taken when I was

05:51.694 --> 05:57.863
commanding general at Kelly Field, and he came 
down there. He was chief of staff there. This was

05:59.603 --> 06:00.645
after the war. Yeah, 1946. Yeah, and he came down 
there to make an inspection for the veteran. Now,

06:09.920 --> 06:15.710
at this time, the German Air Force was still rather 
powerful. What were your thoughts in the Air Force

06:17.233 --> 06:21.360
about the Luftwaffe? Well, they used to come over 
and bomb. They bombed the harbor in Iran and

06:25.895 --> 06:29.598
dropped a few bombs. One time I was in Algiers and 
they were bombing a harbor there. I was in the

06:34.763 --> 06:37.325
hotel.

06:41.108 --> 06:47.093
Traces of bullets go right by my window at these 
Jaron planes. I stood that for a little while and I

06:47.113 --> 06:54.720
decided I'd go down to the basement where the air 
raid shelter was and I got down there A few

06:56.405 --> 07:06.495
entertainers down there from this country who 
were entertaining the troops. They were being

07:08.938 --> 07:10.599
entertained that night. They weren't doing any 
entertaining.

07:15.885 --> 07:20.109
There weren't many people down there in the bomb 
shelter. What did you think of the quality of the

07:20.129 --> 07:22.311
German Air Force? Well, they were, I didn't know 
too much about them because I wasn't in the

07:24.907 --> 07:29.433
fighting business. Right, right. But from what I 
gathered talking to my friends, why they're a

07:31.335 --> 07:39.385
pretty hot bunch. Pretty good. They knew their 
business. Now at this time, or after this time, you

07:43.811 --> 07:51.060
got to know General Mark Clark, is that right? 
Yeah. Could you describe him? He was a pompous,

07:54.607 --> 08:07.199
ultra-conceited ass, but don't quote me. Well, 
he's long gone,

08:07.219 --> 08:12.203
so. Oh, he got his start by, I guess he could speak 
French. He got in, or maybe Italian. Anyway, he got

08:22.417 --> 08:31.870
He went ashore somewhere and talked to French, I 
believe, and he started promoting himself then.

08:31.950 --> 08:42.185
He must have had a real bent for promoting himself 
and maybe a good publicity man because next thing

08:31.950 --> 08:42.185
you know he's a general. Where is he? He's way back 
here halfway from Moran to Casablanca, sitting

08:44.728 --> 08:51.698
there. hundreds of miles from where the fighting 
is, and he's parading. He's formed himself an

08:58.435 --> 09:07.526
armed honor guard, dressed him up in beautiful 
uniforms. As far as he was concerned, there wasn't

09:08.748 --> 09:20.402
a war anywhere in Europe, and he was showing the 
natives how the West Point parade would be hell if

09:21.125 --> 09:22.948
it was over there. He

09:22.968 --> 09:37.649
called up, he had his chief of staff call me at Iran 
there and wanted, I don't know, some sort of fancy

09:22.968 --> 09:37.649
stuff. And I said, I don't have that in stock. Well, 
get it for us. So I said, I'm not in the business of

09:43.878 --> 09:46.882
getting stuff for you anyway. I'm in the business 
of supplying the Air Force here. keeping

09:51.398 --> 09:59.732
supplies and maintenance for the 12th Air Force. 
Well, that didn't set very well with the colonel,

10:01.075 --> 10:05.422
he called me. I guess it didn't set very well with 
Mark Clark either. What did he want? I've

10:11.052 --> 10:11.613
forgotten. I didn't even, it was something I 
needed when necessary to win the war, and that's

10:17.453 --> 10:23.278
all we were thinking about, was winning the war, 
you see. I knew it wasn't necessary. I knew what he

10:24.379 --> 10:25.841
was doing back there. He was just having himself a 
ball with this beautiful arm of honor guard that he

10:27.002 --> 10:36.770
formed, and impressing the natives. What a great 
man he was.

10:41.214 --> 10:41.795
You can have him. Okay. What about Montgomery? I 
never met Montgomery, but from what I've heard, he

10:46.377 --> 10:52.944
was the same type.

10:52.964 --> 10:56.548
But you never came in contact then with the British 
in North Africa? He's what? Did you ever come in

10:57.489 --> 11:01.073
contact with the British Army in North Africa? 
Some of the British officers, yes. They were all

11:05.538 --> 11:09.743
very fine, very cooperative. For instance, in 
Sicily, I had trouble with the quartermaster,

11:13.495 --> 11:19.701
General Eisenhower's quartermaster.

11:22.943 --> 11:35.134
When we went into Sicily, the quartermaster of the 
Army was charged with furnishing us food, trucks,

11:22.943 --> 11:35.134
and things like that, hardware.

11:37.917 --> 11:41.680
Never could get any trucks out of the 
quartermaster. I unloaded a shipload of trucks

11:42.925 --> 11:49.151
for him one time in Iran on the promise I'd get 10% of 
them. And son of a bitch went back on his word and

11:49.291 --> 11:53.355
didn't give me any. And over in Sicily, I went over 
from Jaila, I think, at that time. I flew up to

12:03.605 --> 12:09.150
Palermo, where General Patton was in charge. I 
talked to his quartermaster about getting food

12:12.980 --> 12:14.622
for the Air Force. We weren't getting any rations. 
And so and so said, well, I just have dock space

12:19.227 --> 12:26.635
enough to unload food for the ground troops. The 
Air Force will have to get the food somewhere else.

12:30.760 --> 12:31.381
Can you imagine that? Gee whiz. Yeah. So I borrowed 
60,000 rations from the British. They were very

12:36.607 --> 12:38.989
cooperative. You mean their own army wouldn't 
help you, but the British would? The British

12:41.552 --> 12:42.413
would, yeah. The British helped me out on trucks 
when I couldn't get them from our own

12:42.646 --> 12:50.155
quartermaster. The British were very 
cooperative with me.

12:56.884 --> 13:08.839
Now in 1943, we invaded Sicily, and you moved from 
North Africa to Sicily in a new job commanding the

12:56.884 --> 13:08.839
51st Troop Carrier Wing. Well that was after I'd 
been in Sicily for some time. So you moved up to

13:12.785 --> 13:20.815
Sicily then with the 12th Air Force and you were 
still in supply and maintenance. Advanced

13:20.935 --> 13:27.663
echelon of the supply and maintenance section of 
the 12th Air Force. Did you have any major problems

13:27.683 --> 13:32.750
with supply or maintenance with that invasion? 
No. I had plenty of cargo planes I could go back to

13:38.907 --> 13:44.613
Algiers or Tunis and get stuff if I had to have it. 
And we got along fine, except for that business of

13:46.094 --> 13:54.623
rations and trucks. We never could get those.

13:58.547 --> 14:08.897
We finally got this ration business straightened 
out because General Doolittle said, come on,

13:58.547 --> 14:08.897
George, let's go up and see Patton. So we went up, 
and Jimmy talked to Patton for a few minutes, and we

14:09.299 --> 14:18.751
had lunch with him, and got the business of rations 
straightened out. General Gay was Patton's chief

14:19.973 --> 14:24.719
of staff, and he had lunch with us just before us. 
And we got the business of rations straightened

14:26.241 --> 14:33.491
out, but I never did get trucks. I was sold. 
disgusted about the truck situation. I guess I

14:38.993 --> 14:40.555
sounded off too much. General Ridgeway, I think, 
was taken over from Eisenhower and said, maybe you

14:41.637 --> 14:54.153
ought to transfer the troop carrier. He thought I 
was getting to the point, I guess, where I was going

14:55.935 --> 15:04.146
nuts about this truck situation. So I got out of 
supply and maintenance and got into the troop

15:05.290 --> 15:10.795
carrier business. I loved that, being commanding 
general of the 51st Troop Carrier Wing. That was a

15:15.500 --> 15:16.681
nice job. Now, exactly what did you do? Well, we 
supplied. We had

15:22.006 --> 15:29.033
one squadron of flight nurses. We transported 
wounded back to the rear hospitals. We

15:35.243 --> 15:38.890
transported supplies up forward. We flew 
supplies over into Yugoslavia to drop to the

15:40.032 --> 15:58.365
partisans there, or land and deliver them, and 
bring out anybody in Yugoslavia that wanted to get

15:40.032 --> 15:58.365
back to the American lines.

15:58.717 --> 16:01.641
Did you do any flying yourself or were you just 
commanding? I didn't make any of the flights over

16:01.881 --> 16:14.319
the Yugoslavia because that was contrary to the 
policy, higher up policy where the general

16:01.881 --> 16:14.319
officer didn't be flying over the lines unless it 
was necessary. Right.

16:23.011 --> 16:24.893
That's about all I can think of that we did. We lost 
We had one pilot who overshot Barry and overshot

16:28.265 --> 16:46.283
the Catania, Sicily, and took a load of nurses, 
flight nurses, over and landed in Yugoslavia out

16:28.265 --> 16:46.283
of gasoline. And we were about three weeks getting 
them back. The partisans took care of them and kept

16:51.728 --> 16:55.572
them out of the hands of the Germans. We were in 
touch with my radio all the time. We finally got him

16:59.957 --> 17:05.563
back to Catania, Sicily. Threw a big party for him 
with the help of some medical alcohol. What did

17:10.488 --> 17:17.296
you think of Patton? I liked him. He was a 
swashbuckler type of MacArthur. But when you come

17:26.804 --> 17:36.015
with the fighting way, it didn't make him any 
better than Patton when there was some action out

17:26.804 --> 17:36.015
there in the field.

17:40.060 --> 17:49.051
When the war was stalemated, I mean when it was 
stagnant and we weren't moving far, I didn't care

17:40.060 --> 17:49.051
for the way Patton paraded around. I'm not the type 
to parade myself around, but he liked it. just like

17:55.323 --> 18:02.892
MacArthur was a big show-off every time he got a 
chance, but he knew how to deliver when it was

17:55.323 --> 18:02.892
necessary. Now

18:02.912 --> 18:11.041
in 1943, you made general officer. Yeah. Can you 
tell me how that came about? Well, I was commanding

18:14.365 --> 18:24.216
about 14-15,000 troops there at Constantine.

18:24.972 --> 18:27.435
forward echelon of the supply and maintenance. I 
think I had 15,000 officers and men. With the 12th

18:32.140 --> 18:34.202
Air Force Service Command? Yeah, and General 
Spatz came over to see me one time from his

18:35.344 --> 18:54.625
headquarters and talked to me a few minutes and 
looked over at what I was doing and then he said to my

18:35.344 --> 18:54.625
Chief of Staff, Colonel Ayling, he said, take a 
message to Washington and then he dictated the

18:55.465 --> 19:15.791
message it's imperative that Colonel Beverly be 
promoted to Brigadier General because he's

18:55.465 --> 19:15.791
commanding 14,000

18:55.465 --> 19:15.791
personnel in the forward area and should be 
promoted at once. I think the same day or the next

19:18.114 --> 19:22.840
day why the hardest came through to make me 
Brigadier General. Were you standing right there

19:27.731 --> 19:30.135
when he dictated that letter? Yeah. What did you 
feel? Oh boy, was I happy. And so was Colonel Haley,

19:34.101 --> 19:36.625
my Chief of Staff.

19:41.012 --> 19:49.165
Yeah, I knew I deserved it, but then I wasn't going 
to stop and wait for it.

20:03.826 --> 20:13.860
In the summer of 1943, you were back in Sicily as the 
51st Troop Carrier Wing again. Were you

20:13.900 --> 20:15.041
commanding at them? Yeah. Okay, so you were the CEO

20:16.003 --> 20:22.151
at that time. And you went to Rome. Well, that's

20:24.555 --> 20:32.145
after I transferred to the 15th Air Force. General 
Twining had the commanding general of the 15th Air

20:33.425 --> 20:56.732
Force and a very good friend of mine and I decided 
I'd like to move on up into Italy and take charge of

20:33.425 --> 20:56.732
his service command for him and he very graciously 
agreed to it and sent his

20:57.927 --> 21:03.416
General Manning back down to take my job, so we just 
swapped, switched jobs. And after, when I went...

21:07.242 --> 21:10.388
Exactly what did you do then when you switched 
jobs? Well, I just took my headquarters personnel

21:10.588 --> 21:23.209
and records and things, put them in a C-47 and flew 
up to Bari, Italy to take over the job of commanding

21:24.033 --> 21:28.299
general of the 15th Air Force Service Command. 
Now, what did they do? They serviced the 15th Air

21:32.365 --> 21:39.015
Force units with supply and maintenance. I had 
23,000

21:40.257 --> 21:50.412
military personnel to about 1,500 officers, I 
think, the rest non-commissioned officers and

21:51.809 --> 21:57.337
privates.

22:01.002 --> 22:14.982
We had units spread all over South Italy and at 
every tactical unit, every bomber unit or a

22:01.002 --> 22:14.982
fighter unit, why I had a group Supply and 
maintenance. Then I had several depots. I went

22:21.098 --> 22:23.621
forward in the Berry area. The number one was up at 
Fujiya, that's north of Berry. I had one depot down

22:29.468 --> 22:33.032
south of Berry. I had a depot at Berry. I had three 
depots. And...

22:43.379 --> 23:02.082
The service groups, I don't know how many stations 
there were, but there must have been at least a

22:43.379 --> 23:02.082
thousand of these service groups and three 
depots. My headquarters unit was a very distant

23:02.102 --> 23:08.650
squadron there, about a hundred men. So you had a 
tremendous responsibility at that time. When you

23:11.577 --> 23:14.321
went up to Rome, what were the conditions like? 
Rome hadn't been touched by bombs.

23:21.812 --> 23:26.639
The Romans were acting like there had never been a 
war. They were going around about their business,

23:26.679 --> 23:33.329
their living. Naples was all busted up with bombs, 
but Rome hadn't been touched by bombs.

23:43.201 --> 23:44.803
People were friendly to us. We went to see all the 
sights, of course. It was just a sightseeing trip,

23:49.329 --> 23:51.472
is all it was.

23:54.897 --> 24:01.386
And during the time when you were in Italy, Jack 
Benny came over and gave a show. Well, that was in

24:01.786 --> 24:03.889
Sicily up there. Oh, okay, in Sicily. I was 
wondering about that. Yeah, I was in Sicily at that

24:08.475 --> 24:11.419
time, I forget. I think I had the 51st Duke Parade 
room at that time. Right, exactly, you're right.

24:17.401 --> 24:18.583
And that's the summer of 43. Now, did you get these 
entertainers often? Did they come often? Not very

24:26.075 --> 24:27.237
often, no. Let's see, I had,

24:28.539 --> 24:37.795
I think twice, I had them, No, I guess more than 
that. Two or three times. Once in Sicily, in

24:40.692 --> 24:43.054
Catania, Sicily. There was Jack Benny. He was a 
bunch. Another bunch I had in Sicily was Joe Lewis

24:45.817 --> 24:50.801
and he was a bunch of fighters. Came over and put on 
an exhibition of boxing for us. Then up in Italy,

24:58.307 --> 25:06.955
Marlena Dietrich, I remember she was there, came 
in.

25:08.977 --> 25:24.883
I guess before a

25:08.977 --> 25:24.883
man that was president of Eastern Airlines died 
not long ago. He came to see us over at Iran.

25:32.255 --> 25:33.938
You know what I'm talking about.

25:38.828 --> 25:55.612
Anyway, he'd just been rescued from a

25:38.828 --> 25:55.612
boat, a rubber boat raft out in the Pacific after 
about 21 days. Oh, Rickenbacker. Rickenbacker,

25:59.538 --> 26:02.182
yeah. He came over to Iran and talked to us. He gave 
us a pep talk. Of course, we were all happy to see him

26:08.900 --> 26:11.785
alive. But as far as I can remember, that's all the 
entertainers we had. Well, did these

26:17.995 --> 26:22.602
entertainers, did they increase morale? Did they 
serve their purpose? Yeah, yeah. They did? Yeah.

26:27.109 --> 26:28.812
Man was very happy to see him. Did the average 
troop, you know, just the old private, did he get to

26:28.832 --> 26:32.818
see these too? Yeah, yeah, everybody. Mm-hmm.

26:39.022 --> 26:45.171
Of course, the next major event is Operation 
Anvil, the invasion of southern France. And I was

26:45.191 --> 26:54.766
wondering, this was in 1944, in the summer of 1944, 
about a month after D-Day in Normandy, and I was

26:45.191 --> 26:54.766
wondering what your role was in the invasion of 
southern France. I was just, still had the same

26:54.946 --> 27:03.139
role of supply and maintenance for the 15th Air 
Force. They were, the 15th Air Force was doing some

27:06.882 --> 27:17.475
bombing along, I believe it was the Rhone River, 
along that valley by Leon, down towards Nice. I was

27:19.338 --> 27:24.965
back at Berry.

27:28.089 --> 27:30.812
Were there new problems because of this invasion? 
No. Were there new problems because of D-Day? Were

27:36.346 --> 27:39.029
they taking too much supplies away from the 
Southern Theater? No. By this time we had enough

27:41.372 --> 27:42.874
supplies? We had enough supplies except the 
things that were in short supply.

27:50.143 --> 28:01.037
The P-51s had a tail wheel and the landing areas we 
had were so rough the flyers were land and bust a

28:01.574 --> 28:03.516
tailwheel. I never could get enough tailwheels 
for the P-51. I never could get enough 56-inch

28:08.101 --> 28:17.110
tires for the bombers who came in on these rough 
fields. Maybe land in a sort of a skid, you know, and

28:17.190 --> 28:29.623
there goes your tires, and I never could keep them 
supplied with enough 56-inch tires. tail wheels

28:30.667 --> 28:59.863
with B-51s, and wing and belly tanks with all the 
fighters because as soon as a fighter plane gets

28:30.667 --> 28:59.863
into a fight, the first thing he does is drop his 
wing tanks and his belly tank and get rid of them so

28:30.667 --> 28:59.863
he can maneuver better and

28:30.667 --> 28:59.863
he doesn't run the danger of having them and send 
her a bullet to go through one of those tanks and

29:00.552 --> 29:05.338
blow the whole airplane apart. So they were 
dropping their tanks and

29:05.358 --> 29:28.669
I was having tanks, U-belly tanks and wingtip 
tanks shipped over in halves

29:05.358 --> 29:28.669
so they could get so many more in an airplane, you 
know. And then my depot would put the two halves

29:29.020 --> 29:34.309
together and make a tank out of it. That's the way we 
had them shipped over. We were short on bomb sites

29:37.735 --> 29:41.221
for part of the time. Another thing we were short of 
was fragmentation bombs. The tactical units just

29:46.990 --> 29:54.403
fell in love with those 500 pound frag bombs. 
250-pound frag bomb, personnel bombs. Never

30:01.259 --> 30:06.925
could seem to get enough out of the States to keep 
them happy. Did you resolve any of these

30:06.945 --> 30:09.548
shortages?

30:13.252 --> 30:15.434
I think we finally got enough belly tanks. How 
about wheels? What'd you do about them? They

30:20.253 --> 30:21.635
didn't have the tires? The wheels would stand up 
the tires. I meant the tires. How about the tires? I

30:26.720 --> 30:27.261
didn't mean wheels. I meant tires. If you couldn't 
get those tires, then what? You just had to ground

30:29.644 --> 30:30.565
them? Yeah, they'd have to stay on the ground so we 
could have the tires because we couldn't run the

30:30.865 --> 30:37.072
risk of having them blow out on landing. Sure. Did 
you ever get enough tires?

30:44.501 --> 30:45.382
I don't think we did. No, not while I was there. I 
came back in October. October of 1944, you were

30:50.493 --> 30:56.939
requested to transfer United States duty. Yeah. 
Now after you tried so hard to get to the war, why did

30:58.140 --> 31:02.404
you want to leave it? I'd been over there 26 months.

31:07.029 --> 31:08.550
The war was winding down. It was certainly evident 
that the Germans couldn't hold out much longer,

31:08.650 --> 31:18.019
and I wanted to get on home. I'm tired of being over 
there.

31:24.975 --> 31:29.461
And your wife, of course, wasn't with you either. 
So you became the Inspector General of

31:29.481 --> 31:33.906
Wright-Patterson. Yeah. So you're back at 
Wright-Patterson again. Yeah. Did you like that

31:39.132 --> 31:40.413
job? No. As a matter of fact, I hated inspection of 
any kind, and that's the reason they made me an

31:42.976 --> 31:48.242
inspector, Some people, you know, just love to 
ball you out and shake things down and tear things

31:49.268 --> 31:57.999
apart. Inspectors, they are the sons of bitches 
that give inspectors a bad eye.

32:07.852 --> 32:11.097
When I inspected an outfit, I was there to help 
them. So I was just the type they wanted for

32:11.117 --> 32:14.161
inspectors. So I got stuck with it, but I didn't 
like the work. I don't like to inspect other

32:18.631 --> 32:24.038
people. Well, you didn't do that very long. You 
only did that for about six months. It took me six

32:27.882 --> 32:30.806
months to get out of there and get the job I wanted. 
That was commanding general of Kelly Air Force

32:31.807 --> 32:39.296
Base in the San Antonio Air Materiel Area. That's 
the job I wanted. Why did you want it? I just love San

32:44.990 --> 32:47.332
Antonio. I love Texas. I love to have my own 
command. I love to be as far from the throne as

32:54.279 --> 33:01.666
possible, and the throne was up at Wright, 
Patterson, and Dayton. Here I was down at San

33:01.686 --> 33:13.377
Antonio with my own little kingdom, about 23,000 
civilian employees and 100 officers to help me.

33:14.335 --> 33:23.348
run the place

33:14.335 --> 33:23.348
and I had bases as far as Little Rock and as far as 
Tucson. It was all part of my command and I could get

33:25.050 --> 33:36.386
out and get away from San Antonio and away from 
Kelly Field and inspect these once a month, you

33:25.050 --> 33:36.386
know. And I just loved that job. Would you say that 
that was the high point of your career? Yeah.

33:43.478 --> 33:44.880
Because you were your own boss? Anything after 
that was at a climax.

33:52.088 --> 33:52.889
What was your question? Was that because you were 
your own boss? Yeah, because I had such a wonderful

33:55.452 --> 34:03.362
command there and everybody seemed to like me and 
think I was doing a good job. I had some wonderful

34:03.382 --> 34:06.125
help.

34:10.891 --> 34:12.793
Were there major changes at Kelly? that you made 
during the two years you were there? No. I didn't

34:17.858 --> 34:20.782
have to make any major changes. What about as soon 
as the war was over, one of the big things in the next

34:22.284 --> 34:30.675
18 months was rapid demobilization of the armed 
forces. Did that affect Kelly? Yes. At one time I

34:34.120 --> 34:40.569
had 20,000 airmen and officers in there for 
discharge. At one time, 20,000. My chief of

34:43.975 --> 34:55.487
personnel set up an assembly line where we could 
turn out 500 a day, turn them back to civilian life.

34:56.028 --> 34:57.269
Certain things they had to have. They had to have a 
medical exam, and they had to sign these papers,

34:57.309 --> 35:10.123
and they had to be given a talk about 
demobilization or would they join the reserve. It

35:11.044 --> 35:13.847
was quite a job. to get these boys out, but we were 
turning out $500 a day there at the last. I also was

35:23.314 --> 35:28.021
making discharge buttons to give each one. We made 
$3.5 million of those things at the depot there,

35:28.422 --> 35:36.034
$35,000 a day. So they all made those little 
honorable discharge buttons? Yeah, and the thing

35:40.521 --> 35:43.345
you put on it. We turned out 35,000 a day. That's the 
reason. I know that's the reason Eisenhower came

35:48.512 --> 36:00.669
down there to inspect me, because he heard about 
it, and we were turning out a different button from

35:48.512 --> 36:00.669
what the Army was getting. The Army was getting 
something they called a ruptured duck. It was put

36:05.196 --> 36:13.247
in a lapel, and the Air Force decided that we'd have 
a separate this charge button and told me to make

36:13.632 --> 36:19.178
three and a half million of them, and that's what we 
were doing. I think you are getting thirsty by now.

36:22.222 --> 36:22.843
No, no. What can I give you some? Not a thing, 
thanks. I could use some ice water. That's what I

36:27.548 --> 36:28.469
thought. How about you? Well, you might give me 
some glass ice water, yeah. All right. I'll do

36:34.796 --> 36:35.317
that. Or lemonade, either one. Now, when 
Eisenhower came down to inspect, Yeah. What were

36:43.231 --> 36:45.754
your thoughts? Tell me about his trip down there. 
Well, I didn't know what he'd come down there for,

36:47.335 --> 36:54.142
but I had a suspicion that he was looking for 
something. I showed him all through the shops, you

36:54.222 --> 37:03.792
know, and we had everything on a similar line 
basis, just like a factory in Detroit. And finally

37:05.294 --> 37:11.280
we came to this place where they were making these 
buttons, and he says, what's this? I said, these

37:12.965 --> 37:18.472
are discharge buttons for the airmen and the 
officers of the Air Force. Stop it. I said, yes,

37:20.594 --> 37:21.295
sir. And that evening after he left, I got on the 
phone. I called Wright Patterson, my boss up

37:27.662 --> 37:30.846
there. I forget who it was at that time. I told him 
that I had been there and made an inspection. told

37:41.720 --> 37:45.704
me to stop making these discharge buttons. The 
next day I got a call from Wright Patterson that

37:45.724 --> 37:49.647
said, go right ahead and make them.

37:52.710 --> 37:54.892
So why didn't Eisenhower want you to make them? 
Well, he thought, yeah here's this Air Force

37:54.932 --> 38:11.187
trying to upstage the Army boys and have a 
different discharge button and he probably never

37:54.932 --> 38:11.187
asked him for his permission. Probably never 
asked him for permission to do it, and maybe he's

38:12.584 --> 38:24.824
the type that likes to have everybody ask him 
before they do anything. Well, what did you think

38:25.024 --> 38:28.970
of Eisenhower just in the brief day that you spent 
with him? I don't think he was the best general we

38:28.990 --> 38:33.117
had during the war, but... Why not? I

38:34.499 --> 38:39.908
guess I didn't know him well enough, maybe.

38:43.668 --> 38:46.572
How efficient was he as far as an inspector? Well, 
yeah, he just, he probably didn't know what he was

38:48.915 --> 38:53.021
looking at. I

38:53.041 --> 39:00.392
call this service. How much we owe you? Why don't 
you take your shoes off? No, I'm fine. I'm just

39:05.058 --> 39:06.360
fine. Are you comfortable? Yes, I am very 
comfortable. You put this on the bill. Just put

39:10.846 --> 39:12.088
this on my tab. So one

39:12.457 --> 39:31.859
of

39:12.457 --> 39:31.859
the major operations at Kelly was discharging 
troops. Anything else? New aircrafts?

39:39.895 --> 39:45.381
over a billion dollars worth of property there and 
a lot of it became surplus when the war was over. As a

39:46.302 --> 40:07.725
matter of fact, six months before the war is where 
they started shoving in war weary airplanes to me

39:46.302 --> 40:07.725
and I had to set up places out in Peyote, Texas and 
then Hobbs, New Mexico and Tucson, Arizona where

39:46.302 --> 40:07.725
we put some of these in mothballs and set up a detail 
at Walnut Grove, Arkansas, where we were junking a

40:08.465 --> 40:22.479
lot of B-24s. Were there any problems as far as that 
was concerned, or was it pretty smooth? Any what?

40:29.146 --> 40:30.528
Was there any problems? No problem. No, with the 
help I had, I just didn't have any problems You had

40:36.933 --> 40:38.876
superior workers? I had superior men, I had 
superior officers, and I had spent most of my

40:39.437 --> 40:59.328
nervous and physical energy in finding these 
officers to help me because I'm naturally lazy and

40:39.437 --> 40:59.328
I don't like to, I like to have others do it for me.

40:59.388 --> 41:03.514
One officer I was particularly fond of became a 
major general A couple years after I, about a year

41:04.540 --> 41:11.106
after I retired. That was a quality officer. I got 
another one, Brigadier General in the reserve.

41:18.754 --> 41:23.478
How about new types of airplanes at this time? Had 
the jets started to come out? No. Was there any

41:27.963 --> 41:32.207
research and development at Kellington? Oh yeah. 
research and development going on all the time,

41:33.008 --> 41:50.909
but the jets were coming along, but we didn't have 
any, I don't think we had any jets in service until

41:33.008 --> 41:50.909
about 1950-51 when the P-80, I believe, was... I 
bet you, or how are the, now with the war over and the

41:50.929 --> 42:02.543
troops coming back and being discharged, how did 
the people in San Antonio treat them? They were all

42:03.350 --> 42:04.972
jubilant. They were happy.

42:09.459 --> 42:30.488
I made some talks over the radio about WAI and the 
main radio station there promoting a separate air

42:09.459 --> 42:30.488
force equal to the Army and Navy and I made a journey 
over to Bryan, Texas to debate with the Navy file

42:32.172 --> 42:36.278
about the separate Air Force. The Navy apparently 
were fighting it but uh and then uh when the Amateur

42:36.418 --> 43:01.555
Athletic Union had their yearly convention in San 
Antonio they asked me to make a principal address

42:36.418 --> 43:01.555
and uh I talked to them about the separate Air Force 
and outlined what We were trying to do what our

43:02.480 --> 43:06.726
ideas were on that. What were your ideas? Our ideas 
were we would have a separate Air Force, equal rank

43:08.408 --> 43:27.053
with the Army and with the Navy, and the whole thing 
would be headed by the General Staff, Chief of

43:08.408 --> 43:27.053
Staff, which is the present setup. That's what we 
were trying for. And why were you in favor of that?

43:34.019 --> 43:43.409
Well, it's a logical result of what we proved we 
could do during the Second World War. We could

43:45.250 --> 43:56.121
do it so much better if we had our own commanders and 
didn't have to go through the Army on it. And the

43:58.484 --> 44:02.608
separate Air Force, why we'd have nothing but Air 
Force officers over us. outside of the Chief of the

44:03.466 --> 44:06.689
General Staff.

44:12.315 --> 44:13.796
We didn't figure on that much. We wanted our own 
separate command. Was there a lot of resistance

44:18.421 --> 44:21.364
from the Army and Navy? The Navy resisted it. The 
Army, I don't think resisted it. I don't recall

44:26.489 --> 44:29.491
that they did. Maybe they were glad to get rid of us. 
Did you feel that you were jeopardizing your

44:31.597 --> 44:37.405
career by going out on the line and giving these 
talks on radio? No, I never considered my career,

44:37.525 --> 44:43.774
jeopardizing my career in anything I did. I was 
just as independent as a hog on ice, and I never,

44:46.397 --> 44:59.595
never

44:46.397 --> 44:59.595
thought of promoting myself by being careful of 
what I said I did.

45:03.473 --> 45:18.589
Now, during your career, you met a lot of very 
interesting people, and some of them visited you

45:03.473 --> 45:18.589
when you were down in Kelly, like Lord Teder, who 
was Chief of the Royal Air Force. Well, I think he

45:18.609 --> 45:20.010
was Chief there. Maybe he was second in command or 
something. He was pretty high up in the Royal Air

45:23.053 --> 45:27.398
Force. What were your impressions of him? Oh, he 
was just a nice fella and had a nice wife. He was just

45:34.021 --> 45:38.366
on a junket. And this is when, 1946? I believe it is. 
And during 1946, the British were attempting to

45:43.413 --> 46:00.396
get the United States to cooperate as much as 
possible in the military with them, and of course

45:43.413 --> 46:00.396
these are, NATO doesn't come around until 1949, 
but the British are already eager for a NATO as As

46:00.832 --> 46:01.833
early as 1946. Did Tedder have anything to say 
about Anglo-American military cooperation? No,

46:07.500 --> 46:09.343
Tedder didn't have anything to say about it. He 
just made a friendly visit. He knew that I had the

46:13.808 --> 46:23.801
largest Air Force depot in the world and he just 
wanted to see it. How about General Wainwright? He

46:27.045 --> 46:28.847
was a grand old man. He and my cousin, Major General 
Fletcher Sharp, were both taken prisoners by the

46:31.207 --> 46:41.422
Japs and mistreated. The whole time they were 
prisoners. Came back physical wrecks. My cousin

46:47.992 --> 46:50.536
died within a year. I think Wainwright died within 
a year, maybe a couple of years. In the meantime,

46:57.486 --> 47:00.150
his wife had become an alcoholic.
