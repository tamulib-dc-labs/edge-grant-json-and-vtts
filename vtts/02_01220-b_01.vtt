00:02.495 --> 00:04.557
And you see that as sort of the future trend. And I 
imagine academics everywhere, but especially at

00:04.597 --> 00:10.382
Texas A&M. Do you think there is a perception of 
molding the A&M system as something that has a

00:10.402 --> 00:18.930
distinctive A&M character to it? In other words, 
that our member institutions will become

00:18.950 --> 00:29.019
Texas A&M? No. I don't believe so. I hope not. Yeah. 
On the other hand, well, another way to put that is I

00:32.549 --> 00:49.415
don't see our other universities becoming branch 
campuses of Texas A&M University. But you know,

00:51.638 --> 01:00.111
chancellors come and go, and boards come and go, 
and maybe in the future people have a different

00:51.638 --> 01:00.111
idea. That's my view. that each of those 
institutions has its own set of opportunities it

01:02.097 --> 01:30.990
has its own special character it has its own kinds 
of constituencies that it serves and i want to see

01:02.097 --> 01:30.990
them develop those areas of advantage that they 
have and they are different the other side though

01:02.097 --> 01:30.990
as you'll see from the system definition here 
there are many aspects of the of the traditional

01:31.578 --> 01:41.788
strengths of Texas A&M University that I want to 
see, in fact, and be transferred to all of our

01:31.578 --> 01:41.788
institutions. One of those is leadership 
development. And you'll see that we've got the

01:46.672 --> 01:57.703
land grant missions of research, education, and 
service, and we've added to that a fourth, which is

01:46.672 --> 01:57.703
leadership development.

01:59.641 --> 02:11.615
All four of those are straight-out growths of 
Texas A&M University's tradition as a land-grant

01:59.641 --> 02:11.615
institution and as an institution that produces 
leaders.

02:15.881 --> 02:26.914
Any other qualities like that you think are 
programs that you would expect to see infused?

02:28.666 --> 02:43.686
And it's not only the way, but the sense of royalty 
and of cohesiveness that the former students of

02:28.666 --> 02:43.686
Texas A&M have, if we can help our other 
institutions to create. I interviewed Luck Wirus

02:43.806 --> 02:46.570
yesterday. Oh, did you? Three and a half hours, I 
think you're right. We really went over that. But

02:51.016 --> 02:55.382
it was really fascinating, the mechanics of 
developing this kind of program. quite a mailing

02:56.240 --> 03:00.506
list. Some of our new institutions didn't even 
have a list of their alumni. I would think it would

03:04.492 --> 03:15.829
be an easy way to transfer that kind of experience 
and expertise, which would make for better

03:04.492 --> 03:15.829
cohesiveness. Well, quality, of course. 
Quality. Commitment to quality and emphasis as a

03:26.648 --> 03:33.257
first and foremost mission for every one of these 
universities being education.

03:36.742 --> 03:41.569
I'd like to see us remember that the fundamental 
reason we're all here is the students.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.998
What about, in that relationship, promoting The 
transfer, literally, of students from one

03:48.299 --> 03:55.047
institution to another, is that easier within the 
system? It is. The problem, and we've been

03:56.830 --> 04:06.722
sharing, A&M University's been sharing its 
excess applicant pool with the other

03:56.830 --> 04:06.722
institutions. And last year, they got quite a few 
students they wouldn't have gotten. Because of

04:11.808 --> 04:12.429
that? Because of that. But the problem here in 
College Station is the saturation level. And as

04:20.879 --> 04:28.067
much as we like ready transfer, it's going to be 
difficult. Do you see this university

04:28.107 --> 04:39.020
developing, as some have suggested, as a 
primarily upper division research graduate

04:28.107 --> 04:39.020
institution? I don't think so. I think one thing 
that Our minority institutions, in particular,

04:45.353 --> 04:56.144
are going to be able to feed, hopefully, good 
candidates for our graduate programs here. And

04:56.384 --> 04:59.527
that will help our diversity issue. And I think 
there's room, whereas the undergraduate program

04:59.547 --> 05:11.680
is pretty full, I think there's room to expand the 
graduate programs. Yeah, I know that's Somewhat

05:15.442 --> 05:21.509
not controversial, but I know a lot of people 
certainly don't want to see the undergraduate

05:15.442 --> 05:21.509
program decline.

05:24.914 --> 05:25.534
I agree with you. And I've got a, I guess I have a 
basic reason for feeling that way.

05:35.787 --> 05:43.356
It's particularly true with any of the 
professional areas, but I think it's probably

05:35.787 --> 05:43.356
true in general, that I would like to see A&M be a 
national leader in shaping how

05:43.741 --> 05:51.469
professionals do their work. Now, I can relate 
best to engineering. And if I speak from an

05:56.274 --> 06:13.191
engineering point of view, I'd like to see the 
faculty of engineering here at A&M be in the

05:56.274 --> 06:13.191
forefront of setting the future directions and 
policies for the practice of engineering. Now,

06:14.487 --> 06:30.767
when you educate people to become engineers, the 
basic education comes at the undergraduate

06:14.487 --> 06:30.767
level, because that's where you cover the broad 
field and you have the basic preparation in math

06:14.487 --> 06:30.767
and science and so on. How you do that is what's 
going to shape how people practice engineering,

06:31.428 --> 06:40.579
because the graduate programs are more 
specialized Yeah. They come at a different point

06:41.979 --> 06:45.964
in the individual's development. And so if we're 
going to be leaders in shaping these fields for the

06:46.945 --> 06:59.740
future, we better have a strong, forefront 
undergraduate program. I can see, too, why you

07:00.281 --> 07:05.507
would stress the collaboration of the university 
with industry, for example. That's what your

07:05.567 --> 07:07.590
primary mission is. I won't keep you any longer. 
OK. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.
