WEBVTT

00:04.199 --> 00:06.042
And that is with Fred McClure. I re-recorded. So 
y'all cooled your heels? Yeah. And, you know, he

00:12.631 --> 00:15.655
was the Uncle Charlie of that place. Wow. I never 
saw anything like it. Well, we eventually worked

00:19.380 --> 00:21.242
out some things. And as a matter of fact, there was a 
very interesting result. One of the professors

00:26.530 --> 00:32.738
who went down there, I think it was Binger, I think 
it was he, taught down there and he came back with a

00:33.967 --> 00:43.588
report that was stunning about how

00:45.593 --> 00:49.941
the rooms weren't air conditioned, although 
there were air conditioners there, but they

00:45.593 --> 00:49.941
didn't work. And what turned out to be the fact was 
that they had used maintenance money for other

00:50.823 --> 00:58.738
purposes. In any event, it led to a big, and you know 
as much about that as I do, what happened, a big

00:59.600 --> 01:06.353
turnover. or did you did you ever have to cope with 
the realities of the services and the stations

01:06.333 --> 01:36.103
reporting to the system where the dean of 
agriculture reported to the campus something

01:06.333 --> 01:36.103
slid it into my mind and it I was asking you about the 
stations and oh yeah that was a serious problem

01:06.333 --> 01:36.103
I mentioned a director who dictated tried to 
dictate salaries even in the veterinary medicine

01:36.404 --> 02:05.382
school if he had a small piece we had a problem over

01:36.404 --> 02:05.382
Kunkel took credit for this but I don't know if it 
was he who actually instigated it but the problem

01:36.404 --> 02:05.382
of designating professorial titles to people out 
in the experiment stations And we never did

02:07.201 --> 02:20.462
resolve that, but it was something that happened 
some time ago, probably in the early days of

02:07.201 --> 02:20.462
Kunkel's deanship.

02:24.268 --> 02:33.462
I think we eliminated it, but there was probably a 
question of whether they would have

02:24.268 --> 02:33.462
representation in the Senate. Now, it'd be okay if 
they were joint appointments, but there are some

02:34.943 --> 02:40.591
who weren't even joint appointments. As a matter 
of fact, I had gone through at the University of

02:40.611 --> 02:48.802
Tennessee a situation where in the last year or so 
that I was there, I was a senator. And the Extension

02:50.885 --> 02:58.055
Service dominated the Senate because they had all 
of these people all over the state of Tennessee. So

02:59.117 --> 03:01.440
there was that kind of thing. If you had 
dictatorial authority, you're the emperor and

03:02.753 --> 03:16.067
don't have to explain it to the voters, how would 
you organize administratively the ag and

03:02.753 --> 03:16.067
engineering experiment stations and extension 
services? Where would they report? To the dean.

03:20.672 --> 03:22.634
And then the dean would report to the? Vice 
president for academic affairs. Chancellor. All

03:28.700 --> 03:29.441
right. Then, now I'm being the devil's advocate. 
How would then anyone anywhere else within the

03:32.639 --> 03:45.888
Texas A&M system, how would they possibly get any 
research money from one of the experiment

03:32.639 --> 03:45.888
stations? Well, I really have not thought that all 
through, but that would be a problem.

03:55.083 --> 04:12.281
You know, I suppose it could be worked out, but I saw 
some, we had some pretty nasty problems as a result

03:55.083 --> 04:12.281
of not having jurisdiction over the extension 
services or the... I think I'm discovering that

04:12.302 --> 04:20.230
one of the consistent problems for 40, 50 years has 
been that organizational structure. Yeah. And

04:22.761 --> 04:31.673
that only under Rudder and Williams, when they 
were head CEO of both the system and the campus, did

04:22.761 --> 04:31.673
we not have it. That's right. And now it seems to me 
at least that the system is very, very, very

04:33.075 --> 04:39.624
personnel heavy. Oh boy, that's, you're 
absolutely right. An enormous amount of money has

04:44.731 --> 04:47.635
gone into the system. And it did happen in the 80s. 
That's when it really took off. All right, back to

04:53.600 --> 05:02.089
other proud moments, victories that you recall 
back in your day. Did we leave any out? Probably,

05:04.972 --> 05:07.295
but I'll think about them later. All right, now I'm 
going to ask the negative. Which deans would you

05:08.976 --> 05:15.343
put on your merit page to give special praise to?

05:19.441 --> 05:26.034
Certainly, Gordon when he was in Geosciences. 
That's Gordon Eaton. Yeah, Gordon Eaton and Mel

05:30.844 --> 05:35.053
Friedman. Mel Friedman in Geosciences. Yeah, I 
thought they both did a fine job.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.460
Mews when he was dean. Ann Mobley, I thought, did a 
good job. And now, what's the president dean's

05:51.992 --> 05:54.998
name? He's good. He really is good. He was the vice 
president at Houston. Oh, yes. The accountant.

06:04.025 --> 06:04.325
Yes. I can't think of his name, but I remember 
trying to help recruit him back in the late 70s as a

06:05.006 --> 06:12.435
faculty member. Yeah, he's a class act. Yes, yes. 
That College of Business almost runs by itself.

06:18.482 --> 06:23.729
One of the things I observed about it is they don't 
really participate in the rest of the university.

06:23.789 --> 06:25.190
They're out doing their own thing. If you round up 
the usual suspects for a committee, with the

06:26.212 --> 06:33.340
exception of a waynetter, one or two like that, you 
run out of names real quickly. In agriculture, you

06:38.668 --> 06:41.091
get lots of them. In liberal arts, you get a bunch of 
them. Liberal arts, Dean? I don't remember one

06:47.460 --> 06:50.584
that's outstanding. Architecture, I think there 
have, architecture is just a disaster area for a

06:51.465 --> 06:58.896
long time. Engineering? Well, again, you know, 
poor old Bob

07:01.349 --> 07:08.720
followed Benson. He didn't have a chance because 
it was Skip Porter there. Samson? I mean, Science?

07:20.779 --> 07:22.041
Veterinary Medicine? Oh, I think John Shattuck 
was very good. Shelton was a good old boy, but he'd

07:27.215 --> 07:32.941
come over and apologize for asking for salary 
increases. He wasn't a fighter for his college,

07:33.562 --> 07:38.307
but he was a very nice man. I liked him a lot. But 
Shattuck was a good one, and he was fourth on the

07:39.749 --> 07:50.121
list, which made for some problems with 
acceptance by the faculty.

07:52.075 --> 07:54.978
I can't, I didn't know Woody as a dean. Fallon 
played games. Okay. And he's paid a price for it,

08:02.505 --> 08:06.609
for that kind of thing. Let's see, who am I, I 
thought Corrigan did a good job with education.

08:12.334 --> 08:18.420
He, the day that I got back from my on campus 
interview at El Paso, We landed, and an hour later,

08:19.801 --> 08:28.051
I was to meet him at the same airport here to begin 
his visit as the prospective dean. Really? And in

08:29.893 --> 08:40.426
the ones that I led, I always insisted we try to 
follow, as much as possible, exactly the same

08:29.893 --> 08:40.426
schedule for everybody. So it would be equal 
experiences. And we would go into the little mini

08:44.371 --> 08:49.217
theater in the Rudder Tower. Rutter Center, and it 
would be an introductory session with the

08:49.383 --> 08:58.071
prospective dean, and I would introduce him or 
her. They would make a presentation about

08:58.592 --> 09:11.445
themselves, their background, and what they 
thought were the major issues before, in this

08:58.592 --> 09:11.445
case, education, and then make conversation. I'd 
try to say, you're not supposed to quiz them this

09:12.145 --> 09:15.469
time. And when I sat down, I was so tired, I said to 
myself, Mr. Dean Corrigan, you'd better be pretty

09:19.522 --> 09:23.872
good or I may go to sleep. Well, an hour later, I was 
wide awake because he was so interesting. I

09:29.404 --> 09:31.388
thought he, I was much impressed with him. Dean, we 
belong to the same church, Dean is really

09:31.672 --> 09:39.863
knowledgeable about what's going on in higher 
education. He and McDonald didn't, McDonald had

09:40.283 --> 09:57.066
nothing but disdain for the College of Education, 
and Dean stepped down, I think, because of Donald,

09:40.283 --> 09:57.066
who was, I wouldn't rank him high as a provost. I 
always wondered why he was selected. I'll tell you

09:59.684 --> 10:02.387
a story about that. Vanderburg promised that if I 
had Mobley on the list, he'd pick him. But Mobley,

10:12.961 --> 10:20.430
Jimmy was sitting next to him. I shouldn't be 
telling

10:20.450 --> 10:25.236
this. Let's see, were there any other deans that we 
left out that you wanted that deserve high praise?

10:34.843 --> 10:39.627
I think John Fackler fought for his college. Which 
college was that? Science. Science. And did a,

10:42.530 --> 10:55.003
it was some one way he said that if we gave him a 
budget of infinity he'd exceed it. But I thought he

10:55.270 --> 10:59.322
was a pretty effective dean. All right, looking 
back on those 10 years, do you remember any moments

10:59.643 --> 11:10.174
of joy that may have been a brief moment where you 
said, oh, boy, I'm glad I was there?

11:13.310 --> 11:25.089
In that little piece that's in this thing, the 
night we were counting the votes on the Senate was

11:13.310 --> 11:25.089
an electrifying experience. It was over in a room 
in, Claude Davis had headed up the program to see

11:25.109 --> 11:34.024
how it would go. And it was over in architecture, 
and it was an exciting evening.

11:45.372 --> 12:04.309
There were lots of things like when we had Bart 
Giamatti here and I put up the money to host a dinner

11:45.372 --> 12:04.309
at Fish Richards for the English department. and 
that was a fun experience because they were

12:06.179 --> 12:14.927
really, the faculty really enjoyed it I think. I

12:15.968 --> 12:26.818
thought that John McDermott did a fabulous job, 
stayed often? Well, did a fabulous job of being the

12:26.838 --> 12:36.186
first speaker of the Senate and then the perfect 
combination of what's his name in agriculture

12:37.870 --> 12:49.281
that we were talking about earlier became the 
second speaker Murray Milford Murray Milford

12:49.683 --> 12:51.164
with his crew cut and all. He smoothed things out 
then with the regents as a speaker went to the Board

12:52.245 --> 12:59.551
of Regents meeting. Because McDermott was, by 
Aggie standards, quote, an outsider. But Murray,

13:04.736 --> 13:06.437
an insider. He grew up in Texas, went to A&M and so 
forth. Cadet, colonel, or whatever. Do you

13:11.742 --> 13:19.048
remember any moments when there was a now amusing 
snafu when something just didn't go the way it was

13:19.788 --> 13:21.952
planned. Gee.

13:31.829 --> 13:34.234
I can't remember one in which. Where somebody 
forgot their speech or didn't show up or. got to the

13:40.493 --> 13:41.995
wrong place. I guess I sort of blocked them from 
memory if they were dead. Do you remember any

13:47.701 --> 13:52.707
regents' meetings that were highly significant?

13:58.754 --> 14:00.496
I remember one of the earliest ones. It was shortly 
after Vandiver had been hired. Bill McKenzie came

14:06.093 --> 14:15.762
up to Chuck and me and said, don't worry men, we'll 
get rid of him within the year. I don't know, we may

14:15.782 --> 14:22.087
edit that out too, but I remember that. For the most 
part, I wasn't there when Jarvis Miller was

14:22.467 --> 14:34.378
terminated, so for the most part it was kind of 
dull.

14:36.063 --> 14:40.488
And then after a while we didn't go, we weren't 
allowed to go, just as well. Okay, about to wind it

14:41.068 --> 14:43.331
up then.

14:46.294 --> 14:47.455
Who would you like to thank?

14:50.478 --> 15:00.388
If you, whether they're living or not, who do you 
wish you could thank for what has happened in these

14:50.478 --> 15:00.388
years here that you've known? Providence, I 
guess. I don't know, I've been lucky in some, in a

15:04.261 --> 15:07.967
lot of respects.

15:13.235 --> 15:17.140
You know, outside of parents, I mean, they 
certainly had a lot. Oh, I was meaning Aggie types.

15:20.666 --> 15:21.167
Aggie types. I really appreciated Mac Prescott in 
my early, early years as a dean of faculty. John

15:32.138 --> 16:02.128
Pearson played a

15:32.138 --> 16:02.128
role as I said we did get out of sorts after a while 
but then we made up people like John McDermott was a

15:32.138 --> 16:02.128
great supporter of mine for reasons I never quite 
understood but

15:32.138 --> 16:02.128
I don't know there's so many people that who were so 
supportive and so friendly it's hard to Pick them

16:03.458 --> 16:04.099
up. People like Gary Hart, of whom I'm very fond. 
Murray Milford. Bruce Schaefer. I mean, there are

16:13.014 --> 16:15.317
a lot of people that helped. All you had to do was ask 
them.

16:22.544 --> 16:35.597
I really did enjoy the relationships with faculty 
and found them always to be so supportive and so

16:22.544 --> 16:35.597
eager to. Okay, two more questions. Next, the last 
one is let's make believe that I gave you a million

16:38.860 --> 16:48.810
dollar check and said there's only one 
restriction on the check. You must give it to Texas

16:48.830 --> 16:52.433
A&M, but you decide what the money would go to help. 
I used to fight for money that was with no strings

16:57.570 --> 17:01.095
attached. And

17:03.478 --> 17:08.765
so that's kind of a hard one. I guess I would put it in 
faculty development leaves.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.901
You're the first person that's thought of that 
one. Well, I was involved with that. No, I

17:22.640 --> 17:23.341
understand. I understand that. I really...

17:24.423 --> 17:35.980
You know, major schools do have significant 
programs, and we haven't got one yet. I don't know

17:36.581 --> 17:37.703
if we ever will. But if we want to be the super school 
that this recent pronouncement had to do with, the

17:38.324 --> 17:50.702
Vision 2020 or whatever it is, 2000... that's one 
of the areas we need to work on let me let me add a

17:51.256 --> 18:18.681
question then you now are emperor again and you can 
give advice to the leadership of the decision

17:51.256 --> 18:18.681
makers about A&M what advice would you give them 
today one

17:51.256 --> 18:18.681
thing I would like to see them have and it's not an 
original idea with me it's one that Tulane had I

17:51.256 --> 18:18.681
would strongly urge that there be created a board 
of visitors

18:20.095 --> 18:36.000
drawn from the highest echelons to come in and 
advise the board and the president. I proposed

18:36.962 --> 18:44.854
that in this 1992 or 3 thing that Calhoun was 
involved in. We were talking about the other day at

18:46.454 --> 18:48.517
coffee. It never got anywhere, of course. But I 
think getting some really top-rated people from

18:51.180 --> 19:07.080
industry, from people who really understand,

18:51.180 --> 19:07.080
you know, big-time people, that would be the one 
thing I would want to see. Right. Last question.

19:09.503 --> 19:15.651
Looking back, what effect did it have on your life 
that you accepted this appointment at Texas A&M?

19:17.892 --> 19:24.559
Well, obviously, it was a very positive effect.

19:31.146 --> 19:33.689
In retrospect, I know I made the right decision. 
I've really enjoyed the years I've been here. I've

19:37.933 --> 19:41.657
been well taken care of. I think the family enjoyed 
it. Let me close then by, on behalf of all of the

19:45.483 --> 19:54.630
people who have maroon blood, to thank you for your 
part in making this place better. Thank you.
