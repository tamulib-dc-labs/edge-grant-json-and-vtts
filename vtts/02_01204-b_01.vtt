WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:06.701
talk about a little bit are some of the other 
series. One of them, the one that got the biggest

00:06.941 --> 00:25.863
attention, of course, was the

00:06.941 --> 00:25.863
Jim Michener and Clady Williams series. I never 
realized at the time But I think, in thinking about

00:30.203 --> 00:52.752
it in retrospect, that I think, here again, as in 
many other things related to the press, Joe Moore

00:30.203 --> 00:52.752
was the person responsible for getting Michener 
involved, and possibly, I suspect that if

00:30.203 --> 00:52.752
Michener hadn't been involved, Clady might not 
have been involved, although it was Clady's

00:30.203 --> 00:52.752
father that a local, you know, regional 
historian, and was interested in his stuff, was

00:53.153 --> 01:10.240
big in the Texas State Historical Association, 
and he was interested in, it's a memorial to his,

00:53.153 --> 01:10.240
Clayton, Clayton, it's the father, anyhow. But I 
think that was a... How was the funding set up for

01:12.203 --> 01:15.728
that? Do you remember any details? Well, it was a 
hundred, I think, I think, Michener gave

01:22.887 --> 01:25.171
$125,000. Okay, $125,000. I think that's right. 
Yeah, I think it's somewhere in my neighborhood.

01:30.741 --> 01:41.661
And Williams got more than that, and it was through 
this bank that Williams was involved with that his

01:30.741 --> 01:41.661
money came. I know that in some of the first books in 
that series, we mentioned this bank in the Tidal

01:45.483 --> 01:53.606
Age or somewhere. Okay, good. I'll check that out. 
I'm sure you can find all that related to the...

02:00.085 --> 02:00.606
Okay, good. And that came into being roughly, 
what, in 1884 or something like that? I can't tell

02:05.896 --> 02:07.058
you. I don't know. That's okay. Oh, okay. Well, I 
can look. It's easy. I got the first book. Why don't

02:11.284 --> 02:12.005
I just look? I

02:12.265 --> 02:22.520
might have profited more from a relationship with 
Frank Leonard. He looked upon Frank Wardlow as a

02:22.540 --> 02:27.286
kind of a father in a way. Frank Wardlow was really 
the sponsor of his author, his writing career,

02:31.045 --> 02:41.280
Frank, I think, published his first book and 
advised him on numerous books.

02:44.144 --> 02:57.863
And that book, the first book that he did for A&M was 
one that the commercial people turned down

02:44.144 --> 02:57.863
because it was too big, it was too long, they 
couldn't get it all under one, between two covers,

02:44.144 --> 02:57.863
and he'd had a long time contract with it. some 
commercial outfit, and they dumped it because it

02:58.602 --> 03:09.437
wasn't . Any other series that you know of? Yeah, 
the other one that I think is the Charles and

03:11.360 --> 03:19.010
Elizabeth Prothrow Photographic Series. And 
these are these people in Waco or somewhere.

03:23.737 --> 03:27.462
There's a whole lot of correspondence on that one, 
I am sure. They've done, they did a number of books.

03:33.149 --> 03:38.957
The best, the one that I liked the best was For God, 
Country, and the Hell of it. No, not the Hell, the

03:38.997 --> 03:42.762
Glory of it or something.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.347
That lady is somebody else. She's, oh, I think 
she's something special. You know, they also did a

03:49.732 --> 03:52.836
follow-up. She went to Russia. and attended the 
reunion and got to meet all the Russian women

03:54.543 --> 04:02.912
pilots and took their pictures. Yeah, that was a 
sequel one. Yeah, that was part of it. But that was

04:07.837 --> 04:09.158
fascinating. Those women were something else. 
But I think this Pro Throw series... How did that

04:12.982 --> 04:19.669
come to be? There was a guy named Wright You're

04:23.737 --> 04:39.383
going

04:23.737 --> 04:39.383
to talk to the rest of the staff, so there's no... 
Yeah,

04:41.152 --> 04:54.208
you might, and you might just look to see what there 
is, what Ray Gromyla left behind, if anything. He

04:54.228 --> 05:06.823
was, he had much, many more connections than 
Billingsley, although Billingsley belonged to a

04:54.228 --> 05:06.823
group of production managers that always met at 
every national meeting. They always got

05:06.863 --> 05:08.205
together. And there was this guy that was the 
production manager in Chicago that later went

05:08.557 --> 05:15.784
freelance and did a, designed a lot of books for 
A&M.

05:20.648 --> 05:23.070
But his name isn't fine. He was a big crony of Ray's. 
And the reason Billingsley got the job at A&M

05:25.453 --> 05:31.478
really was because he knew about Ray. And he was 
having all this trouble. And he actually, if I

05:35.162 --> 05:37.804
remember right, He actually made overtures 
before we even inquired about him. And I just

05:42.810 --> 05:46.193
grabbed him because we needed him. We've got to 
have somebody. And see, that Susan wasn't there.

05:49.136 --> 05:51.358
Ray was all by himself. He had terrible 
assistants. They were nothing. Ray did it all. And

05:57.203 --> 06:00.926
there wasn't anybody there that knew what was 
what. And Dillingsley was willing to come. He came

06:04.970 --> 06:07.993
the same way he left, one step at a time. He came over 
in a trailer and was there. Yeah, kind of on the

06:11.967 --> 06:15.935
side, still attached to Tennessee or something. 
Yeah. And then I know when he left, he did the same

06:17.017 --> 06:20.563
thing. He took books, manuscripts back to design 
and all this stuff. Yeah, made a deal with Stetter.

06:26.134 --> 06:27.757
Yeah. I never could figure out Stetter. I don't 
know how he got that job. He's still at Suarez. I

06:36.885 --> 06:39.468
know he's still at Southern Illinois. And I'm 
going to try to talk to him. He comes in to visit his

06:40.890 --> 06:43.713
wife, and her wife never left. She still lives in 
the neighborhood.

06:51.002 --> 06:53.004
I wonder about that. She hated college, didn't 
she? when she first came there, the last, you were

06:56.270 --> 07:06.105
at that meal, that dinner, the night, I'm sure you 
might have been there, when, Stenner? Let's see, I

07:07.788 --> 07:23.593
guess

07:07.788 --> 07:23.593
you should say, I was retired because I was 65, 
Okay, so it was that time. It was that time. You

07:26.126 --> 07:27.427
really didn't have a choice, by the way. Well, I 
suppose I could have bought another... It seemed

07:32.434 --> 07:34.156
like... I know the feeling. Yeah. The perfect 
time, it was the time to leave. Both of us were

07:41.206 --> 07:46.192
thinking about the West Coast. I mean, this is... 
Leia is very fond of this part of the world, and I

07:47.873 --> 07:54.862
always thought of this as the place where I would 
end up. And the press was in good condition. Yeah,

07:59.328 --> 08:00.449
so far as I knew. Things were going well. Yeah, I 
think so too. And it seemed that this was a good

08:02.071 --> 08:06.336
point to break. Yeah, at the height. Yeah, and not 
go away when you're feeling good about it, and not

08:08.339 --> 08:17.070
run off when you're feeling bad about it. If there 
were, what were the high points, would you say, of

08:17.219 --> 08:24.769
your, of your whole diplomacy? Money, people, 
books, staff? I think one of the high points, yeah,

08:26.972 --> 08:39.088
one of the high points was, was the whole meeting 
and association with, with Michener, which I

08:26.972 --> 08:39.088
thought was an interesting experience. Not only 
Michener, but also his, his right hand, King,

08:39.168 --> 08:44.735
King, John Kings. Yeah, John, yeah. Kings. Yeah. 
Yeah. and uh that was that was interesting now

08:47.324 --> 09:13.095
incidentally mitchum money was supposed to set up 
some sort of a school thing weren't you going to do

08:47.324 --> 09:13.095
something or did you do something well that's that 
was that that went that that went ultimately that

08:47.324 --> 09:13.095
went to texas that's the writing school that i 
think john king's runs i think he's the guy that

08:47.324 --> 09:13.095
loves it we were going to get that for a while well it 
was oh it was questionable yeah there was there was

08:47.324 --> 09:13.095
some yeah talk about that, and I can't remember now 
why it went the other direction, but I don't think

09:13.447 --> 09:25.325
Michener really got along with anybody. He didn't 
dig A&M, really. He liked the Moors. That's the

09:30.894 --> 09:35.441
Michener connection with A&M. And I think 
Michener probably pulled the boys into the Texas

09:39.670 --> 09:41.772
I'm sure he did. I mean, the boys gave big parties to 
the Texas Press in recent years. Incredible

09:47.679 --> 09:48.359
years. Well, that's Michener. I'll bet you. You 
know, Michener also gave, has given big money to

09:51.723 --> 10:01.253
the creative writing school at Iowa. That Iowa 
creative writing school. I think this is in the

10:03.435 --> 10:05.998
millions. He

10:06.670 --> 10:13.638
did one about... He was in the habit of every place 
that he... He said that. Well, he's given more than

10:19.464 --> 10:22.087
that to the... I mean, he's given more than just 
one... I think he's given to Iowa, not to Iowa, but

10:26.492 --> 10:34.341
to the Writing Center and to Texas University. 
He's given more money... than all the others. I

10:37.979 --> 10:40.463
mean, he's given that art collection to UT. You 
know, he's given a bunch of pictures to the band. I

10:45.410 --> 10:48.474
wonder if he ever did anything in Alaska. I don't 
know. I bet he did, somewhere. I bet he did, too.

10:51.479 --> 10:53.101
I've never fallen in love before. At least that was 
his modus operandi for everything else he did. I

10:58.489 --> 10:58.970
don't know. I think that mostly just the 
experience of Texas, the people I met were

11:05.530 --> 11:12.439
completely outside my experience anywhere else. 
And that was fascinating. I got to see people like

11:14.341 --> 11:29.681
Clayton Williams, like Joe Moore, John Lindsay, 
the whole...

11:14.341 --> 11:29.681
Frank Vandiver. These were people that were all 
Texans. Oh, I said it was to do with the guy that

11:35.399 --> 11:44.949
supported Lindsay. The guy that put up the tower 
for the... Oh, Albritton. Ford Albritton. Yeah,

11:51.155 --> 11:52.276
Ford Albritton. You know, we did that book for him

11:52.296 --> 12:03.988
about his brother-in-law,

11:52.296 --> 12:03.988
about the... In fact, that's... I know when you 
first came, you were startled by their formality.

12:14.226 --> 12:14.647
Oh, yeah. But over time, how did you and the press 
relate to the faculty? I tried, without success,

12:20.452 --> 12:34.245
to interest the engineering people, and I must say 
I didn't have any luck at Cal for the same reasons.

12:34.630 --> 12:46.505
they saw no purpose or whatever, and they had their 
established publishing outlets, and they were

12:34.630 --> 12:46.505
different. I thought, as far as the English and the 
history departments were concerned, that was

12:46.745 --> 12:54.035
fine. Also, although we never published a lot, the 
vet school I enjoyed the people that I, and I can't

12:58.627 --> 13:12.662
remember a single blessing name, but reading that 
book about horse color and a couple other books,

12:58.627 --> 13:12.662
and I think they were valuable books. And the 
architecture people,

13:13.743 --> 13:21.832
that was cool. Do you think the, generally 
faculty, are aware and supported of a university

13:26.302 --> 13:30.566
press? You can say that generically for any 
university or Texas A&M University. I think it's a

13:35.551 --> 13:36.632
curious thing. I think that many faculty are more 
sympathetic and more aware of a university press

13:36.752 --> 13:46.481
at another institution than they are of their own. 
That can be almost a... That's why I asked the

13:46.641 --> 13:52.487
question. I think so too. Well, they don't, I don't 
know exactly why this is. They always, the profit

14:00.360 --> 14:06.289
is never appreciated at home. That's right. And I 
think that applies right across the board for, it

14:07.070 --> 14:22.093
was my experience at California and LSU also, that 
the likelihood was for a faculty person to Trying

14:22.816 --> 14:30.606
to publish elsewhere, right, because they sense 
that if you have to go publish on your own, it's less

14:22.816 --> 14:30.606
prestigious. Yeah, well, it's just a house organ 
that just cranks out stuff because it can't get

14:30.926 --> 14:37.835
accepted anywhere else. And originally, 
university presses struggled under this a lot.

14:45.404 --> 14:51.372
And in fact, if you look at Cal, the history there 
You hear people saying this is the reason that they

14:51.959 --> 14:56.485
started the thing. Certain departments couldn't 
get, they didn't have the publishing outlets, and

14:56.545 --> 15:06.738
they wanted some way to get their stuff available. 
And that was one of the main reasons for a

15:06.758 --> 15:11.905
university press. What do you think a university 
press, a Texas A&M university press, Well, I think

15:21.254 --> 15:37.479
it demonstrated the coming of age of Texas A&M 
University as a full-fledged, as not just a

15:21.254 --> 15:37.479
technical school or a military academy. This, I 
think, a university press, certainly in my time, a

15:39.582 --> 15:47.093
university press was indication of the maturity 
and sophistication and competence and all the

15:47.495 --> 15:57.527
rest of the institution. And during the, from the 
50s through the 70s anyway, a lot of university

15:57.547 --> 16:05.796
presses were started. There were lots of them. 
Just look at Texas. I mean, a whole lot of things got

16:12.033 --> 16:31.082
started just inside the state, but that went on all 
over the country.

16:31.222 --> 16:31.843
Are they going to... The responsibility of the 
university press was to academic excellence, to

16:31.863 --> 16:39.355
providing an outlet for material that didn't 
necessarily

16:39.773 --> 16:53.967
appeal to a wide audience, that it was important 
for a university press to publish material that

16:39.773 --> 16:53.967
was for scholars. I don't think that's the way it is 
anymore. I think the line between commercial

16:58.071 --> 17:07.941
presses and university presses has become almost 
obliterated. It's very hard to distinguish I

17:10.520 --> 17:19.733
mean, that book we were talking about the other 
day, the LSU

17:10.520 --> 17:19.733
Confederacy of Dunces. I mean, that a university 
press should publish that book. Many places would

17:24.279 --> 17:28.185
have refused to consider that years ago. Now, 
almost any would love it to happen.

17:36.877 --> 17:40.442
And this is partly because the kind of support that 
was originally provided to university presses

17:40.861 --> 17:46.090
has become less and less and less. Marketplace is 
directing the university press. Yes, and that's

17:50.216 --> 17:52.921
not always the best. In many ways, it's bad.

17:58.269 --> 18:01.775
Top stuff gets the lead. And this is where Frank 
bridged that. I mean, got over that pop stuff by

18:05.515 --> 18:11.022
doing those picture books. I mean, some of those 
picture books are perfect

18:11.042 --> 18:15.929
examples. I mean, he was able to do those and not 
compromise, or not seem to compromise. But those

18:25.662 --> 18:31.590
kinds of books are now much more common.

18:35.671 --> 18:40.939
And the other thing is the intrusion of the 
computer. Yeah, I'll have to work on that. And

18:42.601 --> 18:44.564
that'll fit into the production, too. Yes, yes, 
yes. That has... University presses are not the

18:46.047 --> 18:53.518
only publishing activities that are under 
pressure. It's any publishing activity, as it's

18:53.818 --> 19:02.792
been practiced since Gutenberg. I

19:03.852 --> 19:20.491
wouldn't be surprised if they come, I don't know, 
Lee put together for, what was it, Wardlow's

19:03.852 --> 19:20.491
Retirement or Dedication? I think Wardlow's 
Retirement. Yeah. He did a piece which combined

19:24.636 --> 19:30.142
A&M, Texas, and South Carolina logos. Oh yeah? 
Yeah, I think that was when he retired, yeah. Yeah,

19:34.427 --> 19:37.051
yeah, that's, yeah. And in fact, the title, which 
is the second chapter,

19:38.814 --> 19:50.171
Fire, Air, Earth, and Water. Oh, yeah. Good. I 
thought it was good. It sure did. Yeah, that's a

19:53.356 --> 19:54.257
good one. That's good. Okay, so O'Neill Forsberg. 
Yeah, I'm going to get that just to show you.

20:36.631 --> 20:44.402
These things came out after, this came out after I 
left, but I worked with Mary, Carol, and Holland.

20:44.422 --> 20:52.133
See, and this is, this ended up as number one in the 
Sarah and John Lindsay series in the arts and

20:44.422 --> 20:52.133
humanities, so that's, now I've got to cool it 
down. Yeah. Because this is, has lots of nice

20:52.794 --> 20:56.299
pictures. Yeah, and do you remember, you don't 
remember, but you remember that. Oh, yes. on

21:03.918 --> 21:28.018
lindsay something yeah i mean they're dollars you 
know oh i don't know the faintest idea because see

21:03.918 --> 21:28.018
that that that whole that series was founded after 
i left that's something that happened under

21:03.918 --> 21:28.018
rick's

21:03.918 --> 21:28.018
jurisdiction and i don't know what the date i think 
it appeared in the early 90s very late 80s

21:47.827 --> 21:49.849
Yeah, yeah. Well, see, Mary Carolyn Collars 
George, do you know who she is? She's a San

21:58.480 --> 22:08.332
Antonian, and she was a big friend of the woman who 
ran that bookstore. I have heard of her. She was a

22:12.802 --> 22:16.808
good, the woman that ran the bookstore was a big 
buddy of Frank's.

22:21.916 --> 22:33.814
Mary Carolyn just, this book had all kinds of, 
there was a guy at Texas that was going to also write

22:21.916 --> 22:33.814
a book about O'Neill Ford, and for a while he was 
making such a big noise that She was afraid that she

22:34.047 --> 22:43.959
didn't go ahead with hers, but he was making noise 
so she finally got it all. Her husband teaches or

22:44.600 --> 22:54.672
did teach in the architecture department at

22:44.600 --> 22:54.672
UT.
