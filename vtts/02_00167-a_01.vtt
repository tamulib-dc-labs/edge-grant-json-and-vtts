00:02.613 --> 00:03.374
Mike is working. This is July 30. Right. Seated in 
the beautifully decorated and awfully neat

00:06.879 --> 00:15.231
living room of Howard Perry's. Going to chat about 
his days at A&M. Test your mic now. All right. Can

00:21.379 --> 00:22.541
you hear what I'm saying?

00:27.548 --> 00:27.909
I do. I always, when I listen to my own voice, I 
always think it sounds terrible. Tell, for the

00:34.338 --> 00:51.558
person that might read or listen to, read the 
transcription or hear the tape, begin by giving us

00:34.338 --> 00:51.558
a brief summary of your experience before you 
first came to A&M as a student. Well, I actually was

00:51.578 --> 00:56.143
born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. And I always tell 
everybody, as soon as I could walk, I came to Texas.

01:02.387 --> 01:03.529
That's not quite true. But I came to Texas when I was 
about six years old, I guess. It was in 1928 or 29.

01:13.284 --> 01:15.347
I'm not sure of the exact year. Then I moved into a 
little town called Spearman in the panhandle of

01:15.948 --> 01:21.356
Texas. My father was... And he was the manager of 
the Ford place there. And he also, on the side, did

01:30.119 --> 01:42.112
some repair work on refrigeration, which a lot of 
people had some refrigerators, but not a whole

01:30.119 --> 01:42.112
lot. And I went through grade school and high 
school there. Well, my father died.

01:55.675 --> 02:10.994
I spent about a year out of Spearman, and I went to 
school in St. Louis, Missouri, in one of their

01:55.675 --> 02:10.994
schools, and then came back to Spearman, because 
Mother then got some work back there. This was

02:11.034 --> 02:14.918
during the hard times. I went on to high school, and 
we— Well, you lived in Cuba for a year. That was

02:25.308 --> 02:29.313
during that period of time, too. Anyway, I

02:30.655 --> 02:43.152
came back, as I said, and went to school, high 
school and all, and graduated from high school.

02:45.315 --> 02:47.518
Spearman was a very small school. I think there 
were sixty-eight in a graduating class, if that

02:47.598 --> 02:52.885
many. But I decided I wanted to go to Oklahoma A&M. 
And so I went over there one summer because we

02:57.401 --> 03:12.317
didn't have solid geometry and chemistry in 
Spearman, and I wanted to take that solid geometry

02:57.401 --> 03:12.317
and chemistry in a summer session, which I thought 
would be a little better. But I came home from

03:14.118 --> 03:17.522
there, and... I got ready to go back to Oklahoma 
A&M, but I'd been talking to a couple of my friends,

03:18.785 --> 03:30.900
one that was going to be a sophomore down here at 
A&M, and the other very close friend of mine was

03:18.785 --> 03:30.900
coming down here as a freshman. So we got in the car 
that morning to go to Oklahoma A&M, and I told my

03:32.241 --> 03:43.214
mother, I said, you know, I think I'd rather go to 
Texas A&M. Well, she just did a right turn, and we

03:44.536 --> 03:47.880
came down here. unannounced.

03:52.052 --> 04:00.944
And they went to the registrar's office, which was 
down in the Koch building, and I arranged to get my

03:52.052 --> 04:00.944
transcripts in there, but they let me come in. 
Wait, you said Koch building. Koch building

04:03.187 --> 04:05.930
was... Not Koch building, the administration 
building. Yeah, excuse me. The administration

04:07.452 --> 04:08.113
building. Do you know what year that was? Yeah, 
that was in 1940. 1940. Okay.

04:14.101 --> 04:17.125
And I couldn't get a dormitory room, I find a 
project house at the North Gate that I could live

04:18.843 --> 04:23.267
in. And this, my mother left me standing on a corner 
on a Friday before Monday when all the kids came

04:24.027 --> 04:35.618
back. This is in the fall. September. Do you 
remember what, describe what gear, clothing and

04:41.182 --> 04:46.787
everything, what all did you bring? Well, Of 
course, I brought underwear and towels and stuff

04:48.391 --> 04:56.062
like that and a little bit of civilian clothing. I 
don't think I had a suit. Yeah, I guess I did have a

04:58.545 --> 05:01.109
suit and a couple of shirts. But before Mother 
left, she bought me what I needed. We had to buy a lot

05:05.635 --> 05:08.159
of our uniforms in those days. They issued some, 
but the rest we had to buy. And shoes and socks and

05:12.365 --> 05:15.188
stuff like that. And she arranged for me to... 
going to Penny's in Bryan, and I could sign a check

05:17.450 --> 05:24.901
for her name by me there. That's the only place, if I 
bought something I needed in the way of clothing.

05:32.251 --> 05:36.477
And that was an unusual experience. I'll tell you, 
I was so lonesome. And then when my room, the guy

05:39.021 --> 05:45.330
from Spearman I was going to room with came in on 
Sunday, And the other guys began to come in, too, at

05:47.015 --> 05:56.724
the project house, and of course they divided, I 
don't know, I'm sure people have told you about the

05:47.015 --> 05:56.724
project house. We divided up the work and 
everything and took the bills at the end of the

05:56.764 --> 06:02.490
month and split that by however many. Now, what 
bills were there? Well, they had the utility

06:04.872 --> 06:14.622
bills, food bills, and I'm sure the bills for 
paying this woman that ran and cooked the things,

06:04.872 --> 06:14.622
because we did the dishes and all. She was a hard 
worker. She wasn't anybody's aunt or

06:16.141 --> 06:18.023
grandmother? No, no. She may have owned the house. 
I don't know. No, but I've heard in some cases a

06:24.590 --> 06:32.978
widow or an aunt or a grandmother might come and be 
the chief cook, but that wasn't true. Not that I'm

06:33.058 --> 06:35.140
aware of. Was the whole house from Spearman? No, 
no. There's only two of us from Spearman. I don't

06:43.108 --> 06:43.509
know. They were from all over, but I mean... Man, 
the minute the sophomores get there, we began to

06:46.381 --> 06:50.208
catch it.

06:54.235 --> 07:03.913
My roommate and I kept one another in school 
practically on a nightly basis. I'd want to go home

07:03.933 --> 07:06.718
one night and he didn't want to go home. The next 
night he'd want to go home and I didn't want to go

07:07.119 --> 07:10.144
home. But once we got by Thanksgiving, that was all 
over. What was it in those first weeks that caused

07:13.494 --> 07:17.798
you to be homesick? Well, you know, I've been away 
from home so far, and I was an only child. That's

07:23.925 --> 07:24.826
another thing. And the hazing was in the project 
house. I don't know. It was bad in the core, too, but

07:30.411 --> 07:34.675
it was just about as bad in the project house. And, 
of course, we caught it when we got on the campus,

07:35.136 --> 07:37.939
too. What... Give some examples of the hazing you 
endured. Well, they beat our fanny regularly. And

07:45.877 --> 07:56.409
I

07:45.877 --> 07:56.409
tell you, it was, and I was a skinny kid, and it 
really hurt. But then, and they had a ritual that

07:56.429 --> 08:05.680
when you were on the campus, walking across the 
campus, you saw one of your upperclassmen, you had

08:06.622 --> 08:11.587
to speak to him and call him by name. Now, later on, 
when I got into the Corps, that turned out pretty

08:12.568 --> 08:24.120
good because if he was with a young lady, he was 
obligated to introduce us to the young lady, see?

08:25.001 --> 08:32.149
But they hadn't, it was just completely changed. 
And the school, My courses were, and I remember I

08:33.740 --> 08:40.768
came from a very, very small high school, and I 
wanted to be an engineer, which was a mistake.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.854
Freshman registration was in Sbisa? No. We got our 
registration cards out in front of the old

08:47.356 --> 09:00.591
assembly building, and we picked those up, and we 
visited all of the departments that we were going

08:47.356 --> 09:00.591
to take a course in. and tried to work our schedule 
out. And then we, of course, were assigned to a unit

09:03.157 --> 09:07.365
in the Corps. We had to get that in. And that was all 
done by somebody there in the administration. We

09:14.338 --> 09:15.640
didn't know who the heck it was. So that you were in a 
Corps unit that first semester, but you lived in

09:16.762 --> 09:23.355
the project house. Did anybody treat you 
differently because of that arrangement? Well,

09:29.722 --> 09:33.566
we were day ducks, even though we lived like that. 
When we came on the campus, we had to wear a campaign

09:33.886 --> 09:51.084
hat, and we stood out like a sore thumb because the 
kids that lived on the campus, they didn't wear

09:33.886 --> 09:51.084
headgear on the campus unless they were going to 
military science. How would they pick on you then

09:52.045 --> 09:53.747
for it? Well, you know, they'd ask us questions and 
then they'd ask us when we didn't, you know, they'd

09:54.048 --> 10:03.382
stop, you better dang sure introduce yourself to 
them. And then you had to ask them where they were

10:03.822 --> 10:13.537
from and what their major was and supposed to 
remember that, you know. And they didn't haze us

10:13.557 --> 10:20.006
physically on the campus. Mm-hmm. from being in a 
project house. As you look back on it now, who were

10:25.878 --> 10:33.226
some important people for you in that first 
semester? Of course, my roommate. Friends or

10:35.388 --> 10:36.229
faculty? I really, I had Dutch Holm. and for 
Algebra I. And I

10:52.231 --> 11:00.320
don't remember. I think Paul Mason may, I'm not 
sure, may have been a mechanical drawing. And I

11:07.970 --> 11:14.157
didn't take chemistry, the first year of 
chemistry.

11:15.689 --> 11:16.750
I don't remember. Ralph Steen was a Texas history 
teacher. We didn't have a textbook because he was

11:23.860 --> 11:29.307
just written one, you know, and it hadn't been 
published. And

11:30.649 --> 11:41.663
my association mostly was with there, and a woman 
that ran this, bless her heart, I can't remember

11:30.649 --> 11:41.663
her name, the project house, You know, it was kind 
of the one that kept us going. Did you live there all

11:44.973 --> 11:46.094
year? No, I left there, and I left at the end of the 
fall semester because I ran out of money. The house

11:53.202 --> 11:54.464
ran out of money? No, I did. Oh, you did. Oh, so it 
cost, do you move to the Corps then? No, no, I left

12:00.671 --> 12:04.135
A&M and went to work. Do you remember what that 
first semester cost in round numbers? Well, we

12:10.567 --> 12:13.370
paid them articulation fee of $50. Okay. And I 
think we had a laundry fee of not very much, but they

12:16.093 --> 12:23.440
do your clothes once a week with so many pieces. And 
my room and board, the lowest I remember was about

12:24.682 --> 12:31.108
$15 a month. The highest was about $25. My memory 
may be a little vague on that. And... Anyway, then I

12:42.089 --> 12:46.275
left the first semester, and then I came back. I 
still had to do my fifth year, the second half of it.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.066
I came in September. Of 41. Right.

13:02.878 --> 13:04.321
That was something. So you were away for nine 
months. How much money did you bring with you that

13:10.338 --> 13:13.482
second fall? Enough to register and pay my, my, uh, 
my articulation fee and, and mother took care of

13:13.522 --> 13:26.478
the, they call it subsistence, for the room and 
board. Right, right. You had gone home and worked?

13:28.962 --> 13:33.107
Yeah, I worked in Spearman and I worked with my aunt 
in, in Alabama. How did you get back that second

13:33.688 --> 13:35.670
year? Did somebody drive you, or did you 
hitchhike? I don't know that I, I think mother

13:39.453 --> 13:50.583
brought me and left me, because she was gone away, 
which we moved out of Spearman and went on to

13:39.453 --> 13:50.583
Amarillo, I mean to Alabama with my aunt. Because 
on the motor transportation, using your thumb.

13:56.648 --> 13:59.951
All right, that second year, you're in what 
outfit? B-field artillery. And where were they?

14:05.216 --> 14:06.417
In the New Dorm area? No, they were over in the old 
Darm area. They called it, the new Darm area was

14:09.785 --> 14:12.669
being built. Oh, okay.

14:17.476 --> 14:22.123
I want to say I was in, I can't remember whether it 
was 6th or 8th. I think it was 6th.

14:26.489 --> 14:27.851
I think it was Darm 6th. Tell me about your outfit. 
Oh, B-field and We had a bunch of good guys, and my

14:33.633 --> 14:39.722
classmates, there's some of them are dead now. 
Dick Hill, we called him Senator Hill, and Forrest

14:40.723 --> 15:03.015
Sharp, he got killed during the war, and McIntyre, 
Don McIntyre, whose daddy was a colonel down here

14:40.723 --> 15:03.015
at one time, he got killed during the war, and Earl 
C. from Waxahachie, and Harold Abona, from U

15:03.417 --> 15:08.785
Valley, and Richard Phillips from Dallas. Now, 
the class of 1940 then wasn't very close with the

15:09.947 --> 15:22.345
class of 41, or 42,

15:09.947 --> 15:22.345
because they gave us a hard time. Even sophomores, 
they aged us pretty good at 42, did. But they were

15:27.072 --> 15:31.298
the, that was then, we, We had, you know, the usual 
pranks we'd pull. Such as? Describe them. Well, a

15:37.503 --> 15:51.591
drowned out is some of them, and they called it, I 
told Dolores this I think several times, a float

15:37.503 --> 15:51.591
out, which is you just gave somebody a hard time. It 
didn't have to be true or anything else. But you had

15:54.734 --> 15:56.857
to be detailed to do that. And the only way you could 
do it is if you could float out a sophomore, for

15:57.578 --> 16:07.550
example, if a junior or senior told you. And you 
could float out a junior if a senior told you. Now,

16:11.055 --> 16:16.522
this worked even, sophomores sometimes are 
caught part of this. But I remember there was a guy,

16:17.062 --> 16:21.568
Pat Murphy, And he had a date one of the weekends. 
This was before, I think, before I met Dolores.

16:30.040 --> 16:39.209
Anyway, she was eating in the dining hall, and this 
freshman sitting across from him just kept

16:30.040 --> 16:39.209
staring at this woman. It was obvious that he was 
staring at her. And finally he turned to Murphy and

16:42.492 --> 16:48.218
he said, Mr. Murphy, I don't think your girl has a 
bad complexion. Boy. Everybody knew what

16:51.164 --> 16:53.287
happened, of course. He began to apologize to the 
girl, and finally the guy that detailed it came up

16:53.307 --> 16:58.215
and said that. All right, now, a float-out, was 
that a drown-out with more water? Well, most of the

17:03.342 --> 17:06.387
time it really was. They put it in the room. Okay. 
But we didn't do that. We drowned out more than we

17:10.773 --> 17:12.857
floated out. What other pranks did y'all try? 
Well, it was always...

17:21.472 --> 17:23.555
That flowed out and things like that. I don't 
remember too many other pranks. Did any of your

17:28.484 --> 17:35.555
friends put an animal in somebody else's room or 
move their car up in the hallway? No. They only

17:36.978 --> 17:39.722
needed cars to speak up. Do you remember any 
pranks, whether they involved you or not, do you

17:39.903 --> 17:47.395
remember any pranks that in fact were 
destructive?

17:50.783 --> 17:51.304
No.

17:54.188 --> 18:07.348
So a drown-out... Well, if you got too much in it, it 
would run down to the room, through the holes

17:54.188 --> 18:07.348
around the radiator, and we were very careful 
about that, not to get too much. All right, now, so

18:08.109 --> 18:17.062
if you and your buddies drowned somebody out, then 
they would have to take their mattress and put it

18:08.109 --> 18:17.062
out in the sun. That's right. We did, yeah. Or did 
the freshmen get to do that for them? Well, if they

18:21.274 --> 18:24.157
were up there, freshmen probably did it. And they 
used to beat their mattresses regularly to soften

18:24.857 --> 18:31.123
them up and air them out. Then, as the Lord said, I 
had a blind date and went to Brenham on the 4th of

18:33.145 --> 18:44.436
July and met her. And I don't remember, was I a 
junior when I met you?

18:52.732 --> 18:53.713
Yeah. I think I was a junior then. Who helped 
arrange this? Well, I think it was Willie

18:58.960 --> 19:04.026
Zappalack that got me there. Willie Zappalack, 
Charlie Moccamel. And Charlie Moccamel. That was

19:05.928 --> 19:09.032
another one in my outfit from Brenham I didn't 
mention. He and I, we're still very close friends.

19:13.538 --> 19:19.465
I'm with Charlie Moccamel, Harold Abona, and Dick 
Phillips. And where did you go on that first date?

19:24.894 --> 19:32.623
Well, there was a very famous spot over there in 
Brenham, and when I met her, I went up to get her at

19:24.894 --> 19:32.623
the door. We got to the car, and she announced, 
we're going to the wagon wheel.

19:38.991 --> 19:40.373
What's the wagon wheel? It was a place all of the 
high school and college, not a lot of college kids

19:42.293 --> 19:51.925
would come to you, particularly on Saturday 
night, because it was a big place. They served

19:52.326 --> 19:55.690
beer, and they had a jukebox, and we danced. And we 
had a good time there. When you talk about

20:02.375 --> 20:15.193
destructive, there was one thing that happened 
there one night that had no relation to us, but this

20:02.375 --> 20:15.193
one fellow I called Forrest Sharp, we called him 
Feedy. He was the most likable guy in the world, but

20:15.213 --> 20:20.340
you'd get a few beers in him, he got belligerent as 
hell. And there was the Navy then came into A&M. And

20:25.932 --> 20:34.104
some of those sailors were over there, and he 
decided, he went over and mouthed off at them, and

20:25.932 --> 20:34.104
they decided they were going to beat him up. And he 
ran out and went through the window to get away from

20:35.226 --> 20:39.812
them, and the police caught him. He caused a riot. 
Anyway, that's another story, I guess. All right,

20:46.242 --> 20:55.315
and for you and your buddies, was it unusual for you 
all to drink beer on a date or a night out? Yeah,

20:56.510 --> 20:58.974
because we didn't have too much money. I never had a 
beer until I

21:01.137 --> 21:08.148
tasted beer up in the Pan Pan. Spearman was dry as 
the Sahara Desert. Somebody, a friend of ours, had

21:12.255 --> 21:18.785
some beer in there, and I know one of the boys, and I 
tasted it. I didn't like it. But I came down here and

21:20.320 --> 21:34.266
then part of the rituals, I think this was before I 
left, they took us out to Nezzy's and got us beer.

21:34.306 --> 21:35.268
Was it Nezzy's? I know you weren't there, but there 
were two places out there that we used to go to. You

21:41.500 --> 21:43.223
only went to one, I think. Well, there was 
Franklin's, and then, of course, the famous

21:44.317 --> 21:49.786
place, what was the name of the place? Mr. Ed? 
Navels, Navels. Huh? Was it Navels? No, the one out

21:53.291 --> 21:57.157
at College Station that had sold out. Oh, Uncle 
Ed's. Uncle Ed's. Yeah. That was the famous,

21:59.301 --> 22:01.544
that's where the kids hung out. Hardlickers. But 
they didn't have dancehall. They didn't have much

22:03.988 --> 22:06.612
beer because they didn't have much money. They 
didn't have that's all. So drunkenness was seldom

22:08.666 --> 22:11.991
a problem in the dorm? Oh yeah, very, very, very 
seldom. In the dorms,

22:14.435 --> 22:27.637
we sometimes hid with some of the guys that had 
their, you know, had a bottle of maybe a pipe or

22:14.435 --> 22:27.637
something like that. They tried to hide that. And 
we had some very ingenious ways. And when I became a

22:34.759 --> 22:37.122
tack officer, it paid off. You'd pull a medicine 
cabinet out of the wall and take a wire or string and

22:38.044 --> 22:53.065
wrap it around the bottle top, the neck of the 
bottle, drop it down on the wall and then fasten it

22:38.044 --> 22:53.065
there and then put the medicine cabinet back. 
Nobody would find it. And under the shoe rack,

22:54.507 --> 22:56.711
they'd try that. But they didn't have... there 
wasn't drunkenness. When they came in at night, if

23:03.468 --> 23:13.200
they were a little bit rowdy, the senior that was on 
duty, boy, got them quiet and in their sacks.

23:19.107 --> 23:27.257
So that partly the reason they didn't drink or 
party more was they didn't have the money. So the

23:28.216 --> 23:33.222
girls didn't want you to drink. They didn't mind if 
you had a beer, but she and most of her friends, if

23:33.663 --> 23:40.692
you got more than two, that was too much. And, of 
course, when we came to the dances here on the

23:40.712 --> 23:46.620
campus, we didn't have a drink then. And 
intermissions, we went down to the two drugstores

23:46.680 --> 23:53.469
down at the North Gate. Yeah, Kennedy's and 
Lipscomb's, wasn't it? And had a Coke. And had a

23:59.669 --> 24:00.950
Coke. Because they didn't serve anything but 
punch at that time. You all started going fairly

24:04.994 --> 24:10.038
steady while you were students. Yeah. Describe 
the routine for a young man and his date at one of the

24:10.738 --> 24:18.946
big A&M dances.

24:21.688 --> 24:26.472
Well, there was not much you can add to it. There 
were a number of major dances. They had what they

24:30.986 --> 24:35.634
call a regimental ball, and these were always on a 
Friday night. And then Saturday night was a core

24:36.876 --> 24:42.125
dance that was open to anybody in the core. And then 
you had your class dances, and then after them they

24:43.348 --> 24:48.797
had a core dance. And so these were big affairs. And 
the girls all came dressed in evening dresses. And

24:57.322 --> 25:02.468
when you got your gal inside, now the only people 
that could wear a suit were seniors. Everybody

25:02.508 --> 25:04.030
else had to wear a uniform. And the seniors wore a 
uniform a lot of times just so they liked to show off

25:05.191 --> 25:10.518
their boots, particularly when they were new. But 
when we would come in, I'd tell Dolores, before we

25:13.685 --> 25:23.754
ever got into the, the dancers were all held in the 
main floor of Sabisa, and there were chairs all

25:13.685 --> 25:23.754
around the wall. That was the only place to sit. 
They didn't have tables in there. I'd tell her, I'd

25:27.176 --> 25:35.203
say, now at intermission, I want to meet you here or 
someplace we made off at intermission. Because

25:35.223 --> 25:43.050
I'd start dancing with her, and when I'd get too 
far, they had a big stag line down the center, and

25:35.223 --> 25:43.050
boy, I was, be tagged, and the protocol was that I 
couldn't tag the guy back. I had to wait around

25:50.752 --> 25:53.815
until somebody else tagged him, and then I could 
tag in. So it was wonderful times, and they had good

25:55.056 --> 25:58.239
bands.

26:01.022 --> 26:03.885
Like Jan Garber, big name bands. Tommy Dorsey. 
There were hardly any places for them to get a room

26:05.206 --> 26:12.193
in a motel or hotel for the day. And, of course, I 
doubt whether my parents would have even let me

26:12.612 --> 26:16.697
come for that. But they would vacate a dormitory. 
And I think it cost the fellas 50 cents a night. And

26:25.166 --> 26:27.288
for the girls, it was just wonderful. There was a 
house mother there. And if they got you in too late,

26:28.830 --> 26:32.715
they had to meet a kangaroo court. They did. When 
you would go to Brenham to pick up this young lady,

26:38.296 --> 26:39.797
And did you have a car by then? No, she came over on 
the bus last time I rode with one of her friends. No,

26:44.361 --> 26:46.043
I didn't have a car. All right, what time did the 
dances and the social events end in the evening? We

26:52.489 --> 26:57.853
have an intermission, and usually they ended, I 
think, around 1 o'clock, wasn't it? And the girls

26:58.834 --> 27:05.600
had to be in the dormitory room 30 minutes after the 
dance closed. Okay. I can remember that we went to

27:08.468 --> 27:24.630
midnight yell practice on Friday night, and we 
went down there in our uniforms and the girls in

27:08.468 --> 27:24.630
their evening dresses for midnight, and even 
bonfire. They had a dance before bonfire, and I

27:25.011 --> 27:27.895
remember going to bonfire that way. Do you 
remember much at the dances? Do you remember any

27:33.182 --> 27:36.687
rowdiness? Anybody getting drunk, fights at the 
dances? No, I don't. Do you, honey? I don't

27:42.335 --> 27:46.622
remember anybody getting out of line. There's a 
picture in one of the annuals. Everybody was very

27:52.070 --> 27:57.758
modest, but this one girl was in. She was quite well 
endowed, and she had a midriff. Evening Down. What

28:03.357 --> 28:04.539
was that guy's name? It's from Beaumont. There was 
a bunch of them came to school here. Oh, the... He

28:10.989 --> 28:13.432
was the general and one of them became a general. 
Oh, for... It's a Lebanese name. So-and-so

28:19.602 --> 28:20.423
brothers. Yeah. Anyway... Kokinos. Kokinos. 
C-O-K-I-N-O-S. Kokinos. There's a picture in

28:27.093 --> 28:28.375
there. annual of him on his knees in Sebesa looking 
up at this gal in that dress, and it wasn't his date.

28:38.473 --> 28:44.202
But anyway, I don't remember of any round that. For 
one thing, there were a number of faculty members

28:44.342 --> 28:47.667
that would go. Now this was officially a dry county 
for whiskey. Yes. Did you know of a, was there a

28:54.629 --> 28:58.814
well-known bootlegger? No, there was what we 
called Whiskey Bridge. And I don't know, the only

29:03.680 --> 29:15.494
way you could get any hard liquor, which was dang 
seldom, you could go down to Whiskey Bridge and

29:03.680 --> 29:15.494
that guy ran that.

29:18.878 --> 29:22.662
Well, that was, I think, Briscoe owned that liquor 
store there. Yeah. Was there any, did the students

29:25.836 --> 29:30.020
know of any red light district? In Bryan and Brown? 
In Bryan and Brazos County? I've never heard of

29:34.744 --> 29:35.565
any. No, we didn't. The only red light district 
that I, two of them that I'd heard about, one was the

29:38.228 --> 29:46.035
Chicken Ranch in LaGrange. Did, as far as you know, 
did the Chicken Ranch exist in your day? I think it

29:51.460 --> 29:53.762
did, because they talked about it, some of them 
did. And there was one over in Brenham that

29:54.198 --> 29:58.545
sometimes the kids would talk about. I don't know 
about it. Huh? I say I don't know about it. It was

30:01.609 --> 30:04.774
Trixie's or I don't remember what the name of it 
was. What did you and your friends know about what

30:05.655 --> 30:10.803
today we would call drugs?

30:14.749 --> 30:21.078
You know, if you were a guy or something, you were a 
drug, you were a... Did you know? We had a name for

30:21.098 --> 30:22.180
them. Not a drug addict, but...

30:22.565 --> 30:30.320
Did you even know the word heroin or marijuana? Not 
that I know of. I heard of marijuana, I think, but I

30:33.587 --> 30:38.938
never knew anybody that ever had it. Did the 
typical Aggie male smoke?

30:45.447 --> 30:49.091
An awful lot of them did, yeah. I know I started 
smoking a pipe because I thought that looked so

30:49.291 --> 30:53.095
good.

30:56.258 --> 30:57.480
I could never keep it going. But I didn't start 
smoking then. And did any of your buddies chew?

31:06.670 --> 31:11.895
Like in my day, I'm slightly younger than you but 
not much, we thought chewing tobacco was country.

31:12.596 --> 31:14.678
Yeah, I don't remember anybody chewing.
