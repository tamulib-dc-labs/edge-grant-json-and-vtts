00:06.427 --> 00:08.269
How do you deal with that? That's part of the 
question. Well, you don't want to be, you're not

00:12.474 --> 00:14.816
for sale. If you ever lose sight of that, you're 
dead. But we're not for sale. We're for rent, but

00:23.465 --> 00:26.729
we're not for sale. But we'll decide whether or not 
we'll rent out or we'll retire. learn to do

00:34.810 --> 01:02.421
something and you're going to have a talent and as 
long as you don't object on your own set of

00:34.810 --> 01:02.421
principles whatever they are and they differ 
around the world

00:34.810 --> 01:02.421
then you're willing if you're willing to do it then 
you can decide the terms of the contract that you

00:34.810 --> 01:02.421
will do

01:07.227 --> 01:12.775
We are not, however, in the position of being for 
sale. We just won't go out and do anything as long as

01:12.795 --> 01:19.364
you pay us. And how do you afford that? Is that 20%? 
That's

01:23.711 --> 01:29.539
right.

01:31.713 --> 01:36.979
If one administration comes in and we've got some 
turkey who's got the wrong philosophy, and it's

01:31.713 --> 01:36.979
wrong, why? Because it doesn't agree with me.

01:42.024 --> 01:52.356
That's my responsibility, and I've got to be 
prepared to take that risk of defending what I

01:42.024 --> 01:52.356
believe is right. That is, not only, you know, so 
one of our whole divisions finds its resources may

01:52.376 --> 02:00.825
be wiped out.

02:03.877 --> 02:07.261
And I'm looking. The contract is terminated. The 
resources are not coming in. Is that a statement

02:14.389 --> 02:18.273
that that's the end of the deed for that research? 
No. Now we're back to one of your other questions.

02:22.678 --> 02:22.979
Maybe. Maybe not. Got analogies.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.268
Who are the other clients? whose lives in our 
society, and I'm personifying here again, take

02:32.581 --> 02:53.424
lives as meaning not only individuals, but 
industries, institutions, foundations, those

02:32.581 --> 02:53.424
people that we interact with and what we do has an 
impact on them. I've got to go to those people, my

02:53.444 --> 02:57.508
job, and not just take the President of the United 
States work for it, just because he thinks that

02:57.927 --> 03:02.633
defense is great. And

03:04.074 --> 03:15.849
get everybody I've got in this organization 
working on defense and completely abandon human

03:04.074 --> 03:15.849
baggage. I may not be willing to do that. I might do 
that, but I might not. But how am I going to decide

03:19.273 --> 03:22.637
that? I'm going to go talk to all sources of 
information first of all, that I have access to,

03:27.695 --> 03:40.272
that I can get to, whose opinion I respect, and 
whose lives are influenced by that particular

03:27.695 --> 03:40.272
area that has a problem. And I've got to decide, 
based upon that input, and I've drawn the

03:40.292 --> 03:51.508
resources of my colleagues in this system, in the 
UT system, in the California system, the

03:52.467 --> 04:04.224
industries, the entities, those lives that that 
particular area otherwise would have been

03:52.467 --> 04:04.224
impacted.

04:04.244 --> 04:15.360
But equally as importantly, maybe more 
importantly, I sit down with those people and ask

04:04.244 --> 04:15.360
them, what

04:04.244 --> 04:15.360
happened? And why? And what does the future hold? 
And if we ride through this downtick together, how

04:19.282 --> 04:23.888
do we come out of it? And who cares? And if so, so 
what?

04:32.659 --> 04:33.521
Then I'll make a decision.

04:36.625 --> 04:44.395
But if I didn't have that 20%,

04:36.625 --> 04:44.395
we could go through all of that and decide they 
ought to survive. And if the productivity wasn't

04:44.975 --> 04:47.719
there to fund it, You just cry and say, I'm sorry, 
I'd like to back you, but I can't. And no, you die. Or

04:57.301 --> 05:02.025
you'd have to be for sale, and then you'd have to 
make that choice. I'd probably die. It's my thing,

05:03.166 --> 05:06.289
too. Go back to TI. Well, I was on a higher 
philosophical plane at that time with that

05:06.630 --> 05:15.298
comment. I might go to the mountains and get my fly 
rod out and fish. There are other alternatives.

05:27.676 --> 05:33.945
But

05:27.676 --> 05:33.945
TEAS has that responsibility. It's been given 
that responsibility. It's been given that trust,

05:37.490 --> 05:45.040
and it's been given that authority.

05:45.060 --> 05:50.688
So is it that 20% of the lives you have the 
flexibility to take those first risks and ride out

05:45.060 --> 05:50.688
the storm? That's right. It's the key.

05:57.612 --> 06:04.300
and see if you spent all that 20% fully funding all 
these programs. You'd be dead. You'd sold

06:05.681 --> 06:06.462
yourself. You'd sold your option, your 
flexibility. Everybody has got to carry it. You

06:12.189 --> 06:19.938
see, this agency works much differently than the 
factories across the way and the agri-trail

06:12.189 --> 06:19.938
stations. They're on the inverse. They're 80%. 
Just now moving to something like 20% of outside

06:23.752 --> 06:42.356
generated research, the money they get from the 
legislature, the Texas legislature, is more

06:23.752 --> 06:42.356
like 80% of their budget. I have a question that 
I've asked everyone I've interviewed. Oh good,

06:46.111 --> 06:48.314
this is the loaded question. Well, this is a more 
general question in a sense, but I keep hearing the

06:48.494 --> 07:02.614
term high-tech, and I don't understand the 
difference between high-tech and tech

06:48.494 --> 07:02.614
technologies. I don't either. And frankly, I 
don't think anybody does. It's a buzzword like

07:09.027 --> 07:12.131
basic and applied research. I hold the philosophy 
that nobody's smart enough to define that either.

07:20.623 --> 07:26.330
I think that we can conceptualize the difference 
between research and development. I think I can

07:26.470 --> 07:31.517
define for you where research stops and 
development continues. I cannot define for you

07:31.537 --> 07:36.604
where basic research stops and applied research 
continues. Or how you can say when you go into a

07:37.293 --> 07:46.842
research project, which one it is. Or when you come 
out of it. I can get to kind of glib about it. Glib's

07:56.050 --> 08:02.936
the

07:56.050 --> 08:02.936
wrong word. I can't think of the right one I'd want 
to use. That's close enough. It's in the ballpark.

08:07.499 --> 08:13.849
almost tongue-in-cheek, maybe sarcastic even. I 
like von Braun's definition of basic research.

08:20.439 --> 08:25.226
It's the research I'm doing when I don't know what 
I'm doing. Another definition that I think fits

08:26.869 --> 08:33.439
rather well in that same category is Basic 
research is done under a grant and applied

08:34.111 --> 08:42.346
research is done under a contract. Or one that goes 
a little bit further in the same mode is if

08:42.366 --> 08:48.116
anybody's willing to pay for it, it's applied. 
Basic research is the research that's not funded.

08:52.741 --> 08:53.542
Another one. At 20%. At any time, see? Then what do 
you say how much? So you've got to take it to the

08:57.928 --> 08:59.590
extreme. As soon as somebody's willing to pay you 
to do that research, it's applied. Because you

09:05.237 --> 09:07.240
know they've got a profit motive. You know there's 
sinister reasons. You know you're for sale and you

09:08.962 --> 09:13.528
sold your purity, academic soul, to get this thing 
done. I think it's unmitigated.

09:22.525 --> 09:26.750
philosophical mishmash to try to even define it. I 
think we damage ourselves greatly in the academic

09:26.770 --> 09:34.760
community in attempting.

09:34.780 --> 09:46.474
But

09:34.780 --> 09:46.474
some people have the concept that basic research 
is the research that scientists do, and applied

09:34.780 --> 09:46.474
research is the research that engineers do. Well, 
I have the disadvantage, probably, of having been

09:48.918 --> 09:56.345
educated as a scientist. Why is that a 
disadvantage? And mutated into an engineer. So

10:04.333 --> 10:07.556
I've done research. I've taught in math and 
physics. I've done research.

10:16.812 --> 10:40.153
So what's the difference

10:16.812 --> 10:40.153
between

10:16.812 --> 10:40.153
a scientist

10:16.812 --> 10:40.153
and an engineer? There is a difference. I became an 
engineer because I was interested in the

10:40.633 --> 10:46.819
applications

10:40.633 --> 10:46.819
of the fundamental laws of nature.

10:50.613 --> 11:01.787
But when I became an engineer, I did not give up 
being

10:50.613 --> 11:01.787
a scientist. And when I was a scientist, and 
functioning as a scientist, I think I have the

11:01.807 --> 11:14.103
capability of putting on either hat effectively. 
I've got enough confidence in myself to say that. I

11:16.988 --> 11:34.355
believe I can walk into the classroom and share 
with my fellow mankind some knowledge about how

11:16.988 --> 11:34.355
Mother Nature drives this planet. And I can do that 
reasonably effectively in what we call the

11:34.375 --> 11:42.287
discipline of physics, the laws of physical 
science. I think I can walk into an electronics

11:43.128 --> 12:03.918
engineering class and share the principles

11:43.128 --> 12:03.918
of applying those laws to make an integrated 
circuit function in a computer to do

11:43.128 --> 12:03.918
calculations. Those two relate that way. But when 
I have all my business had and I'm in the

12:07.703 --> 12:11.869
laboratory, looking for

12:12.777 --> 12:19.783
the maybe Porter's Law. I used to search for that a 
lot when I was a sophomore. Or at least I would

12:23.627 --> 12:25.608
search for it. I just thought it would happen. But 
if I'm looking for the absorption coefficient of

12:27.450 --> 12:40.742
sound in liquid nitrogen,

12:27.450 --> 12:40.742
and to see how it might vary as a function of 
temperature or pressure or something, And that's

12:41.583 --> 12:42.984
really all I'm interested in. I wonder how Mother 
Nature controls that. How does the sound move

12:45.527 --> 12:47.509
through the production? How does it change and

12:48.169 --> 12:53.814
how does it soar? I learned early on that if I pay 
attention and think freely, that I might discover

12:53.834 --> 13:10.510
an acoustic device for detecting an arrhythmia in 
your heart, which I would call, I believe we can

13:10.979 --> 13:22.592
create an industry and sell a product. And as soon 
as I have that piece of data that has application,

13:22.612 --> 13:31.042
what's I doing?

13:35.007 --> 13:38.691
What I say is, I was a scientist doing research. And 
the results turn out to be to have an application.

13:44.273 --> 13:50.401
The fallacy now injects a piece of personal 
philosophy in the larger scheme of higher

13:44.273 --> 13:50.401
education. The thing I don't like, the thing I'm 
worried about personally in our nation, is that to

13:50.982 --> 14:02.637
try to create a self-image

14:07.696 --> 14:20.940
We want to demand to know what the result is going to 
be rather than taking the risk to be a free thinker

14:07.696 --> 14:20.940
and just use your intellect and take advantage of 
where the research. Most people don't even

14:21.862 --> 14:23.145
understand that word. You can't research until 
you've searched. What are you doing? You're

14:28.755 --> 14:30.478
searching. And if you think you've found 
something, Before you publish it, before you go

14:32.992 --> 14:38.559
share it, you better re-search it to be sure it's 
reproducible. Otherwise, you're going to find

14:38.579 --> 14:40.862
yourself rather embarrassed. And we see our 
colleagues from time to time around this country

14:41.963 --> 14:50.454
announcing great breakthroughs because they 
observed it one time and they only searched it.

14:50.494 --> 14:54.519
They didn't research it.

14:54.539 --> 15:01.328
I find an attitude among some academicians that if 
anything has value or makes money, or has

15:02.995 --> 15:18.015
application into our society, the free 
enterprise, profit-driven, capitalistic,

15:02.995 --> 15:18.015
wonderful America, that they violated their role 
as an academician, if they shouldn't be involved.

15:18.035 --> 15:25.185
Well, that's part of the unmeditated stuff I think 
is unnecessary and not healthy to the strength of

15:18.035 --> 15:25.185
the country and the society that we're in.

15:28.409 --> 15:30.792
Many times, though, when I had my engineering 
handle, What I was trying to develop

15:31.987 --> 15:45.220
based upon research that had already been done. 
Now it was in the department, which I can define

15:45.240 --> 15:49.243
differently. I was trying to build a machine

15:49.263 --> 15:58.833
that would take advantage of those principles 
that were based upon good research. But I was

15:58.853 --> 16:01.335
trying to develop a machine that would build in a 
great circuit. And

16:03.813 --> 16:11.901
while I was doing that development, I got a 
glimmer. Where am I engineering at? Doing

16:14.324 --> 16:19.349
development to make money for Texas Instruments 
by building integrated circuits. Matter of fact,

16:20.870 --> 16:32.402
we were building the first computer to go on board 
the F-111 so our pilots could fly in and mock

16:20.870 --> 16:32.402
whatever about 100 feet off the ground and about 
run into a building. It

16:33.260 --> 16:49.795
occurred, I made some measurements that led me to 
believe that I could now design and set up

16:33.260 --> 16:49.795
experiments in a research model. Moving back now 
into, I don't know what the entry is, I can't go into

16:49.815 --> 17:01.866
the development of it, I'm not sure that that's 
going to be true.

17:04.546 --> 17:08.552
that led me to define my PhD dissertation.

17:12.518 --> 17:27.100
To come back and answer very fundamental 
questions about Mother Nature's principles that

17:12.518 --> 17:27.100
would help us to understand how deeply it is 
produced. And we knew that it was produced, but we

17:29.544 --> 17:33.490
didn't know why or how. We

17:35.090 --> 17:46.120
didn't

17:35.090 --> 17:46.120
understand the laws. And that's what I ended up 
doing. But I was wearing an engineering hat, too.

17:58.150 --> 17:59.591
So that's kind of the end of my soapbox. I have an 
example or two of why I think it's found that way.

18:00.832 --> 18:02.854
You have the problem of, it's encountered in 
research and all this big time. I'm sure you've had

18:02.874 --> 18:04.135
it for a long time, just in the short term.

18:07.709 --> 18:22.795
Well,

18:07.709 --> 18:22.795
that's just a reality. You just do what is the best 
you can. Sure, absolutely.

18:36.278 --> 19:03.298
If you

18:36.278 --> 19:03.298
end up deciding to go on a project where the sponsor 
has got

18:36.278 --> 19:03.298
the short-term deal and you end up getting caught,

19:04.696 --> 19:15.330
you have put in jeopardy, potentially in 
jeopardy, the team of researchers to be cut off in

19:04.696 --> 19:15.330
the middle of what otherwise independent of the 
sponsor. That's why I feel like the agency itself

19:15.350 --> 19:29.469
has to believe in the research that's being done, 
not because the sponsor wanted to pay for it, but

19:15.350 --> 19:29.469
because they believe it was good research to do. So 
in case the sponsor decides

19:29.489 --> 19:34.095
that they're no longer going to sponsor you. At 
least you just don't yank the rug out and say, well,

19:37.143 --> 19:41.608
I signed that deal, and you slam the door. Now, as I 
said earlier, this business of research is so

19:43.630 --> 19:59.408
dynamic and changes so rapidly that you may be off 
on fission research, and all of a sudden, somebody

19:43.630 --> 19:59.408
makes a breakthrough infusion that says, you 
know, We just got through, you know, we're right in

19:59.894 --> 20:03.499
the middle of that in high energy physics right 
now. It's one of the reasons the argument's being

20:03.519 --> 20:07.123
made for the super-electro-super-client. And 
the Brookhaven project, after hundreds of

20:07.143 --> 20:13.251
millions of dollars, it's been shut down. 
Technology's changed.

20:17.256 --> 20:18.878
Somebody else mentioned that. Well, or somebody, 
you know, you skin the cat a different way.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.450
But you see, that's the risk. If you want to try to 
accomplish something, do you do parallel

20:30.539 --> 20:34.363
projects? Sure you do. Should we ordain only one 
university research lab to work on

20:39.888 --> 20:44.452
microelectronics? Heck no. But yet, if you do too 
much of that, you spread your resources so thin.

20:51.198 --> 20:54.882
But if everybody was doing fission, nobody would 
have done fission. Yeah, that's right. You made my

20:55.842 --> 20:58.605
point better than I did. But are there any other 
points that you would like

21:00.087 --> 21:25.469
to make in terms of your views of T's history, 
things that you've noticed that I haven't brought

21:00.087 --> 21:25.469
up? No, I think you brought them out well with your 
questions. I don't think they've done very good

21:28.312 --> 21:29.773
job.

21:35.305 --> 22:01.195
I would

21:35.305 --> 22:01.195
say this about

21:35.305 --> 22:01.195
the agency.

22:01.968 --> 22:09.620
as an entity in the state and in the A&M

22:01.968 --> 22:09.620
system. In this particular window

22:09.640 --> 22:25.765
of time, Texas and America, I think TEAS has the 
opportunity to play a role that's at least

22:27.533 --> 22:53.183
as

22:27.533 --> 22:53.183
meaningful as any other part of the system to the 
future for the next 20 to 50 years, I would say. I

22:53.203 --> 22:55.245
like, personally, this interdisciplinary 
blending of comics from otherwise very diverse

22:53.203 --> 22:55.245
disciplines. doesn't scare me, doesn't bother 
me, I think it stimulates me to create in the

22:57.065 --> 23:05.132
process. If you take a look at the sources of 
invention, what you find is that 99% of the time,

23:05.152 --> 23:24.270
most of the time, the idea for a new product came 
from somebody who had absolutely no obligation.

23:25.364 --> 23:47.655
So,

23:25.364 --> 23:47.655
let's not lose that, particularly

23:25.364 --> 23:47.655
in the university

23:25.364 --> 23:47.655
environment, the academic environment, the 
research environment, where bright minds, young

23:25.364 --> 23:47.655
and old, come together, interact. The more we 
cross our lines and interact with one another, the

23:47.675 --> 23:53.262
better off we are. Personal philosophy.

23:57.325 --> 24:00.148
Let's not be so rigid in defining the constraint. 
It goes, I think, in a self-analysis, I think

24:02.131 --> 24:19.191
that's consistent or maybe driven by or part of my 
argument that I don't believe I'm smart enough to

24:02.131 --> 24:19.191
define the difference between basic and applied 
research. And I know I'm not smart enough to say I'm

24:19.211 --> 24:27.180
going to go in and do a piece of basic research and 
have it come out. Unless I force it. Unless I'm

24:29.735 --> 24:34.039
dishonest with the recertified statistics. Or 
the inverse. I may go in trying to build a specific

24:36.082 --> 24:42.408
widget and discover a new law. I won't discover 
that new law unless I'm willing to. If I just say I'm

24:46.673 --> 24:51.278
going to go in and do this widget, then at the best I 
can come out with is the widget. That's

24:52.490 --> 24:56.655
right. And I've missed that opportunity. 
Unnecessary. So, in my opinion, it's unnecessary

25:01.021 --> 25:07.569
to constrain the thought process or the 
administration definition.

25:10.052 --> 25:16.139
From that point of view, there may be other reasons 
why it has to be carefully scrutinized. Financial

25:16.560 --> 25:19.223
reasons, funding reasons, support reasons.

25:25.480 --> 25:53.665
If for those other reasons that I've just

25:25.480 --> 25:53.665
mentioned, constraints are placed on this 
agency's ability by administrators, by offices,

25:25.480 --> 25:53.665
or by individuals whose philosophy differ with 
mine, who are in the positions of authority and

25:25.480 --> 25:53.665
responsibility, to make the structure such that 
it inhibits it. You can't stop it. Stay consistent

26:03.995 --> 26:05.457
with my earlier. You can make it

26:05.857 --> 26:11.143
difficult. But if it is encouraged, this agency, 
or what it represents, whether it stays in this

26:11.163 --> 26:24.478
agency or not, but the interdisciplinary 
approach, the melting, the interaction,

26:25.252 --> 26:35.772
Engineers can learn an awful lot from business 
people who can learn an awful lot from etc., etc.,

26:25.252 --> 26:35.772
etc. And where there's common purpose and goal, 
what's the way to do it? The state needs it. The

26:43.166 --> 26:45.731
nation needs it. This window. The

26:47.594 --> 27:08.193
window

26:47.594 --> 27:08.193
that began in the last decade will probably close 
in the next decade or two. So it's a 20 or 30 year

27:08.213 --> 27:11.897
window that we're in. The window's closed.

27:19.150 --> 27:29.687
But we came to it, to move through it, a decade or so 
ago, although I don't think we even realized it.

27:29.708 --> 27:38.362
We're running short of trained

27:29.708 --> 27:38.362
minds. Not of minds with the ability, but of 
trained minds, those who have already developed

27:38.382 --> 27:45.073
the power to participate and play in this high 
tech, whatever that means, game. That is a society

27:52.368 --> 28:07.888
that's being driven by rapidly changing

27:52.368 --> 28:07.888
sources of jobs, rapidly changing talents, 
required to participate in making a living,

28:10.147 --> 28:38.095
that's about the best way I can come at the 
definition of the high tech is that the demands on

28:10.147 --> 28:38.095
you to support the style of life that you want and do 
the things that you want to do are changing for

28:10.147 --> 28:38.095
you and you are being forced to learn how to use a 
computer whether you want to or not and if you

28:10.147 --> 28:38.095
choose not to

28:42.850 --> 28:47.757
then we're coming back in this area to earlier in 
our conversation. You may just have to take your

28:47.777 --> 28:52.423
fly rod and go fishing. And you better be prepared 
to exercise that option, or you may just die. So

28:59.092 --> 29:02.376
society is being driven in this window of time. And 
by those kinds of rapidly changing factors, And

29:12.230 --> 29:33.499
it's clear to me that the discipline

29:12.230 --> 29:33.499
of biology, natural sciences generally, is in an 
incredible percentage. You're going to live to be

29:33.519 --> 29:39.908
140, if you'd like to.

29:42.908 --> 29:48.137
And the changes that's going to make in our lives. 
But that is occurring in the same way. So all of

29:51.864 --> 30:02.362
those technologies are going to come forth.

30:05.608 --> 30:07.431
And that's part of And I think I'm beginning to push 
you a little bit right now in the definition of high

30:09.402 --> 30:16.549
tech. We might need to be going into very high

30:16.629 --> 30:26.058
tech for some of what I'm talking about here. And 
I'm not sure if the window I'm speaking of now will

30:26.078 --> 30:38.430
have closed and we move into another one that will 
begin identifiable cycles and civilization. But

30:39.862 --> 30:51.394
what's driving that, Debbie, is

30:39.862 --> 30:51.394
the world shrinking.

30:51.415 --> 30:52.356
The marketplace.

30:54.778 --> 31:02.967
We can walk out of here right now and be wherever you 
want to be.

31:08.650 --> 31:24.040
Why

31:08.650 --> 31:24.040
do

31:08.650 --> 31:24.040
you put about 10 years ago? I don't know. Gut 
feeling. Is there another one that you closed?

31:25.362 --> 31:25.803
Because you've been... The time period of the 
post-World War II period was such a period of

31:25.823 --> 31:27.807
growth that you closed it off. I don't know the 
answer to that either.

31:41.224 --> 31:43.086
I'm not a student of that. I haven't studied 
society's evolution. I've been locked up. Well,

31:49.231 --> 31:50.793
technologically. Yeah, well, I'm not a student of 
technology, but I'm not a student of the history of

31:51.033 --> 31:56.798
technology. I'm sorry about that, by the way, 
because it's most useful. I find myself now most

32:05.190 --> 32:11.058
intrigued by that and much more interested in it. 
You know, when I was looking for Porter's Laws, who

32:11.078 --> 32:16.045
cared whose else laws there were? But once you come 
up to a little clearer reality about your own,

32:16.065 --> 32:26.700
the...

32:28.267 --> 32:56.113
the importance of how things happen

32:28.267 --> 32:56.113
still it become more interesting to me though not 
just as a matter out of curiosity but as a matter of

32:28.267 --> 32:56.113
trying to learn from that to control not yeah not 
just yeah and to control to the extent that we can

32:28.267 --> 32:56.113
learn from what has happened in order to manage 
Maybe it's a better word. But that's, in my mind, is

32:57.990 --> 33:09.429
still...

32:57.990 --> 33:09.429
Control is probably too strong, because I still 
think even in managing anything, it comes back to

32:57.990 --> 33:09.429
the research argument. You want to manage it to a 
certain extent, but you don't want to try to manage

33:09.449 --> 33:21.308
it so that you don't give the project or the 
individuals in the project any kind of

33:09.449 --> 33:21.308
flexibility of their own. I don't feel that smart, 
and I don't like to be around those who think they

33:22.621 --> 33:29.633
are, because I've already found it true. What we 
need to do is to find generally where we think we can

33:30.615 --> 33:43.617
go, work towards that objective, but be 
reasonably flexible in meeting that objective so

33:30.615 --> 33:43.617
that if we find an incentive that our preconceived 
ideas going in were off somewhat, if not totally

33:44.491 --> 33:59.152
wrong, then we've got the honesty to admit that and 
make

33:44.491 --> 33:59.152
a difference. And pay the price, whatever it is. 
Take the risk. Don't worry about

34:02.557 --> 34:06.642
it. Oh, I appreciate all your time. Well, you know, 
all your questions are as good as I've had fun. I'm

34:11.349 --> 34:14.093
enjoying it.
