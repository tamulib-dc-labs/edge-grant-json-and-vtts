WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:14.737
Jim Wilson and I shared a room at 410 Emerson

00:02.478 --> 00:14.737
in the home of Mrs. Scotty Duncan Forbes.

00:18.082 --> 00:30.882
If that's not an appropriate name for a splendid

00:18.082 --> 00:30.882
Presbyterian lady of Scottish descent, I've 
never heard one.

00:35.182 --> 00:44.896
She and her ancient cat fossil

00:35.182 --> 00:44.896
were special and unforgettable.

00:50.424 --> 01:04.665
That year included

00:50.424 --> 01:04.665
continuing the Naval Reserve and the expectation 
of active duty beginning in June of 1954. More

01:06.093 --> 01:33.842
importantly, I was trying to lay the groundwork 
for what I assumed would be a lifetime

01:06.093 --> 01:33.842
a record as a graduate student that would affect 
the rest of my life.

01:38.024 --> 01:42.970
The courses were demanding, but the faculty was 
kind and sensitive.

01:45.994 --> 02:00.673
And so when I left to go to report to active duty in 
Charleston, South Carolina, the Naval Receiving

01:45.994 --> 02:00.673
Station on June 15, I looked back on a year which I 
thought had been comparatively successful.

02:03.156 --> 02:07.862
And I certainly

02:08.281 --> 02:14.527
expected to return to Rice in the fall of 1956.

02:21.333 --> 02:36.988
When we landed at the receiving station in 
Charleston

02:21.333 --> 02:36.988
and made our way to the receiving station,

02:21.333 --> 02:36.988
as we entered the

02:21.333 --> 02:36.988
gate of that impressively large establishment,

02:38.133 --> 02:51.156
a big black Marine greeted me in a memorable 
manner.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.007
Come on in these gates, boy.

03:00.792 --> 03:01.994
You're in the Navy now. Your ass belongs to me.

03:08.643 --> 03:38.093
at the first gathering of all of us, quote, 
transients,

03:08.643 --> 03:38.093
a

03:08.643 --> 03:38.093
first-class petty officer

03:08.643 --> 03:38.093
that we soon learned was nicknamed Ipana because 
of the obvious distinctive lack of toothpaste

03:38.647 --> 03:48.496
use,

03:38.647 --> 03:48.496
which left his teeth unmistakably colored.

03:51.418 --> 04:04.210
Dash told us not to unpack, make many phone calls, 
or do anything because we would all be gone within

03:51.418 --> 04:04.210
two weeks. In the meantime,

04:10.540 --> 04:22.232
We were assigned to temporary task

04:10.540 --> 04:22.232
as the cleanup crew for the receiving station. 
Sweeping, mopping, cleaning out showers,

04:23.853 --> 04:27.397
commodes.

04:30.079 --> 04:39.889
And then I got assigned to the trash truck helping 
lift 55 gallon barrels, which were then used as

04:40.240 --> 04:46.288
trash barrels. Because there'd been a lot of late 
spring rain, the barrels had collected a lot of

04:46.308 --> 04:52.657
water.

04:57.043 --> 05:09.420
So as we lifted them up, the holes in the bottom of 
the barrel gave us each a fragrant shower.

05:11.948 --> 05:23.060
All of the

05:11.948 --> 05:23.060
men that arrived with me were soon gone, and I was a 
sole survivor. Finally, after about three weeks,

05:24.442 --> 05:40.960
I very hesitantly

05:24.442 --> 05:40.960
made my way to the desk of the chief warrant 
personnel officer.

05:45.412 --> 05:59.270
told him my name and the fact that I had been there 
longer than anticipated

05:45.412 --> 05:59.270
and wondered if there was something I should do. He 
looked up, called me by name, and then sent a fright

06:01.974 --> 06:13.849
through my

06:01.974 --> 06:13.849
brain as he mentioned as he said, oh, we have lost 
your service record. We've been wondering where

06:19.370 --> 06:24.136
you were, period, quote. Having heard the rumor 
that the worst thing that could happen to an

06:24.156 --> 06:41.178
enlisted

06:24.156 --> 06:41.178
man was the loss of his record, I worried about my 
fate.

06:41.198 --> 06:43.701
Until he smiled and said, but we found it. It had 
fallen between two

06:44.356 --> 06:56.831
file boxes, between two filing cabinets.

07:00.055 --> 07:04.320
Then he inquired, are you really a college 
graduate? Have you been doing graduate work?

07:08.251 --> 07:15.202
Proudly, I responded in the affirmative way, and 
he said, well, then we're going to keep you here

07:08.251 --> 07:15.202
because we're shorthanded.

07:20.129 --> 07:36.013
He then pointed me toward the information and 
education office where I would spend the

07:20.129 --> 07:36.013
following two years worrying that they must have 
somehow made a mistake because they gave me an

07:36.533 --> 07:46.324
assignment for which I had preparation

07:36.533 --> 07:46.324
and an interest. That

07:48.887 --> 08:06.388
post included helping to prepare

07:48.887 --> 08:06.388
dischargees for their post service education 
whether returning to high school or going to

08:07.465 --> 08:35.869
college,

08:07.465 --> 08:35.869
to help administer the quarterly

08:07.465 --> 08:35.869
printed tests for promotion for all enlisted 
personnel,

08:07.465 --> 08:35.869
and joining with educational efforts both on the 
base and in the greater Charleston area.

08:43.863 --> 09:05.468
The most interesting of those assignments came 
late in the spring of 1956

08:43.863 --> 09:05.468
before the United States officially transferred 
to Japan two, quote, old World War II destroyers,

09:06.123 --> 09:16.654
dash the first warships which the victorious 
allies allowed the Japanese to operate after

09:06.123 --> 09:16.654
World War II.

09:19.757 --> 09:36.113
My task was to give a crash course in 
conversational English to the Japanese enlisted

09:19.757 --> 09:36.113
men, and I soon learned that they were the 
brightest, most determined students I had ever

09:19.757 --> 09:36.113
encountered.

09:38.978 --> 10:07.011
One of the highlights, one of the enjoyable 
highlights of those two years

09:38.978 --> 10:07.011
resulted from a brief mention in the Charleston 
paper that the backfield coach of the Cooper River

09:38.978 --> 10:07.011
Blue Devils,

09:38.978 --> 10:07.011
a football team composed of students from

10:09.488 --> 10:30.729
North Charleston and Chicora, C-H-I-C-O-R-A, 
high schools, the two high schools nearest the

10:09.488 --> 10:30.729
base,

10:09.488 --> 10:30.729
had just accepted appointment as head coach at 
another high school as the 1955 season was

10:09.488 --> 10:30.729
beginning.

10:33.551 --> 10:39.377
The Blue Devil head coach, Hibby, H-I-B-B-Y, 
Hibby Ayoub, A-Y-O-U-B,

10:42.108 --> 10:52.144
expressed regret in the article that at such a late 
date he could not hire an assistant coach and he

10:42.108 --> 10:52.144
really needed a backfield coach.

10:55.289 --> 11:09.111
Forgetting how little real athletic experience I 
had had in two years of high school and two years of

10:55.289 --> 11:09.111
two years each in high school and college, I went to 
see Coach Ayoub and volunteered to assist him for

11:11.133 --> 11:27.468
free, dash, if he could get me off the base at 3 
o'clock, a reward for which I would have done

11:11.133 --> 11:27.468
almost anything. That delightful

11:29.671 --> 11:40.701
experience helped me become acquainted with a 
wide variety of people in Charleston and an

11:41.390 --> 11:56.826
emotional attachment with some very promising 
young men whose careers have certainly

11:41.390 --> 11:56.826
been marked with distinction.

12:02.352 --> 12:10.300
Another

12:02.352 --> 12:10.300
key event in those years was attendance at the 
Southern Historical Association annual

12:11.461 --> 12:26.660
convention

12:11.461 --> 12:26.660
in Columbia, South Carolina

12:11.461 --> 12:26.660
in the fall of 1955. At that meeting, I reinforced 
connection to some

12:26.840 --> 12:39.055
of the Instructors that had been so helpful. And 
that my first year at Rice. And they introduced me

12:45.616 --> 12:47.499
to a new.

12:50.343 --> 12:52.206
Member of their group. Who would be joining them in 
the fall of? 56.

13:05.366 --> 13:06.628
Frank E Vandiver. Dr. Vandiver, the child prodigy 
son of a mathematics faculty member at the

13:08.819 --> 13:37.189
University of Texas, already had earned a

13:08.819 --> 13:37.189
fine reputation as a

13:08.819 --> 13:37.189
very young but talented Civil War scholar.

13:42.569 --> 14:10.770
Thus, I thought about working with him because I 
remembered that in the first year at Rice, the most

13:42.569 --> 14:10.770
memorable course was a year-long seminar on Civil 
War and Reconstruction guided by William B.

13:42.569 --> 14:10.770
Hesseltine, H-E-S-S-E-L-T-I-N-E,

13:42.569 --> 14:10.770
one of the most respected preparers of doctoral 
students in the profession. Dr. Hesseltine, a

14:17.889 --> 14:41.078
senior member of the faculty at the University of 
Wisconsin, had a long list of students he had

14:17.889 --> 14:41.078
prepared for true

14:17.889 --> 14:41.078
leadership in history.

14:44.045 --> 15:11.892
In the course of the seminar,

14:44.045 --> 15:11.892
he gave us much care in how to write

14:44.045 --> 15:11.892
prose, how to

14:44.045 --> 15:11.892
maximize time on the, quote, time on the road, 
doing research,

14:44.045 --> 15:11.892
and suggested that when we picked out a 
dissertation advisor, if possible, select

15:13.947 --> 15:42.621
someone who was comparatively young, whose 
reputation would grow, and

15:13.947 --> 15:42.621
to

15:13.947 --> 15:42.621
whom we would be able to turn for advice, counsel, 
and job recommendations.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.540
for decades to come.

15:50.365 --> 16:00.299
Dr. Vandiver seemed like such an individual,

15:50.365 --> 16:00.299
so I planned to work with him.

16:05.906 --> 16:12.034
As the spring of 1956

16:14.258 --> 16:25.668
came and I looked forward to

16:14.258 --> 16:25.668
leaving Navy duty.

16:28.871 --> 16:42.983
I began to think about dissertation topic

16:28.871 --> 16:42.983
and talked with Dr. Vandiver about writing on the 
role

16:43.300 --> 17:11.856
of Presbyterians in the South during the Civil 
War,

16:43.300 --> 17:11.856
their breakaway from their

16:43.300 --> 17:11.856
northern counterparts, and then the creation of 
an entirely separate denomination.

17:15.430 --> 17:24.345
He gave his general approval to that as a worthy 
task.

17:24.365 --> 17:27.570
And again, with Heseltine advice. As a guide. 
Began to search for the primary location. Of

17:34.962 --> 17:35.824
materials. Relating to. That topic.

17:45.248 --> 18:03.928
That search led to the historical foundation

17:45.248 --> 18:03.928
of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, 
located at Montreat, M-O-N-T-R-E-A-T, North

17:45.248 --> 18:03.928
Carolina.

18:09.674 --> 18:11.256
Further inquiry?

18:14.847 --> 18:43.639
identified the

18:14.847 --> 18:43.639
availability of a little single bed, quote, room, 
quote, in the basement of Geneva Hall,

18:14.847 --> 18:43.639
a student dormitory

18:14.847 --> 18:43.639
at the summer conference grounds for Southern 
Presbyterians at Montree for the fee of a dollar a

18:44.885 --> 18:55.596
night,

18:44.885 --> 18:55.596
a sum which seemed affordable. Paragraph, so 
after a quick trip home to Orange to leave my sea bag

18:57.417 --> 19:13.373
and

18:57.417 --> 19:13.373
participation in the marriage of some Austin 
College friends in Temple, I hurried back to

19:15.327 --> 19:35.038
Montreat

19:15.327 --> 19:35.038
and what I thought was a stylish light blue and 
white 1954 Ford Victoria quote, with white

19:15.327 --> 19:35.038
leatherette interior.

19:39.264 --> 19:43.731
While unpacking that vehicle at Geneva Hall, late 
in the day, I inquired of Bill Dean who would be

19:45.803 --> 20:12.696
residing in the next

19:45.803 --> 20:12.696
accommodation

19:45.803 --> 20:12.696
in Geneva Hall about a place to eat.

20:12.716 --> 20:15.439
When I suggested the Montreat Dining Hall he shook 
his head and

20:17.697 --> 20:44.785
recommended a

20:17.697 --> 20:44.785
place two buildings away

20:17.697 --> 20:44.785
which was a frame structure operated by a retired 
furniture store owner from Jacksonville,

20:46.503 --> 21:09.367
Florida, whose wife had inherited

20:46.503 --> 21:09.367
what was called Bridges Lodge,

20:46.503 --> 21:09.367
a very pleasant structure.

21:13.211 --> 21:14.232
He mentioned that the foreign missionary 
appointees

21:15.123 --> 21:26.117
and other missionaries on their sabbatical ate 
there.

21:32.825 --> 21:42.717
When I asked him why we should go there instead of 
the cafeteria,

21:45.430 --> 21:49.814
He said the food was very good, to which I 
responded, check.

21:52.877 --> 22:01.325
That it was comparatively low in price, check, 
check. And that if we would wait and go to the second

22:02.907 --> 22:14.037
table, they put all the food on the table, and we 
could join then in eating that delightful blend

22:14.675 --> 22:42.555
with the owners

22:14.675 --> 22:42.555
of Bridges Lodge, the cook, and there were three 
pretty girls from some little town in central

22:14.675 --> 22:42.555
North Carolina that

22:14.675 --> 22:42.555
joined, that were working there for the summer.

22:47.986 --> 23:13.065
At my second meal in Bridges Lodge, breakfast the 
next morning, a great deal of teasing centered on

22:47.986 --> 23:13.065
one of the three young ladies

22:47.986 --> 23:13.065
who had, after her evening chores, gone down the 
hallway to shower

22:47.986 --> 23:13.065
and then discovered that her

23:20.690 --> 23:44.185
two

23:20.690 --> 23:44.185
girls from her town had hidden her clothes and the 
towels while she was in the shower.

23:48.612 --> 23:49.313
In some manner, Her embarrassment and the 
attractiveness of her smile during the teasing

23:50.018 --> 23:57.413
caught my attention.

24:01.742 --> 24:11.402
An attachment which has now lasted for

24:01.742 --> 24:11.402
44

24:01.742 --> 24:11.402
years.

24:18.588 --> 24:46.772
Within a few weeks I asked

24:18.588 --> 24:46.772
her, Margaret Joanne Phillips, Jo by name, to go to 
the movie in Asheville

24:18.588 --> 24:46.772
and

24:18.588 --> 24:46.772
quickly

24:18.588 --> 24:46.772
our

24:51.595 --> 24:52.817
Romance warmed. By the end of the summer, I took her 
home to meet her family, to spend a week in meeting

24:54.238 --> 25:06.013
her family in central North Carolina before 
returning to Rice. A complicating factor in this

25:07.936 --> 25:15.325
relationship was that we shared the birthday of 
March 18, But there was an eight-year difference

25:16.958 --> 25:23.304
between my birth year in 1931 and hers in 1939. So 
while I returned for my second year of graduate

25:25.327 --> 25:32.454
work at Rice, she finished high school. I sent her 
the money to fly to Texas. Oh, back up.

25:44.206 --> 25:46.408
Luckily for me, the Southern Association

25:49.122 --> 26:11.129
Southern Historical Association

25:49.122 --> 26:11.129
was hosted by Duke University that fall and met in 
Durham, North Carolina, only 20 miles east of

25:49.122 --> 26:11.129
Mebane, M-E-B-A-N-E. That gave me a good 
opportunity to see her again that fall.

26:17.877 --> 26:18.538
One evening, During that brief visit, after I 
returned to the hotel,

26:20.830 --> 26:49.234
to the George Washington Duke Hotel in downtown 
Durham,

26:20.830 --> 26:49.234
and entered a

26:20.830 --> 26:49.234
somewhat disorganized Lobby crowded with. 
Outdated newspapers. Tobacco smoke. An evidence

27:00.942 --> 27:03.165
of a group of historians. Unfor.

27:09.873 --> 27:11.895
Undeniable evidence of historians.

27:14.378 --> 27:15.059
Spare time.

27:18.844 --> 27:20.065
Two senior.

27:25.495 --> 27:40.477
Hotel Bellman

27:25.495 --> 27:40.477
asked me some questions, including, quote, what 
kind of guys are these men? I responded,

27:43.041 --> 27:44.483
historians.

27:46.886 --> 27:49.690
Then they wondered, what do they do? Do they do any 
work? Yes, sir, they teach. Why do you ask?

27:59.965 --> 28:00.726
And in summary. He mentioned that they had been. 
Talking about this group and agreed upon three

28:05.491 --> 28:09.296
generalities.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.982
The first of which was. Quote.

28:19.968 --> 28:24.173
Day de why day is the lightest tippers we've ever 
had.

28:27.680 --> 28:32.827
Number two, they tells the corniest jokes we've 
ever heard. And number three,

28:34.630 --> 28:51.554
they talk more about women and do less with them 
than anybody that stayed in this hotel, period,

28:34.630 --> 28:51.554
quote. As Christmas approached, I sent the money 
for an airplane ticket to Joe. so she could meet my

28:59.438 --> 29:08.088
family during the Christmas holidays.

29:08.108 --> 29:28.973
I met her in New Orleans and drove back to Orange

29:08.108 --> 29:28.973
and also

29:08.108 --> 29:28.973
took her to see Rice, meet Mrs. Forbes, and then 
that night parked on the beach at Galveston. I

29:31.589 --> 29:36.234
proposed to her, and the next evening, she 
accepted.

29:42.802 --> 29:59.061
A few weeks later, when I came back to Orange on a 
weekend near the end of my stay,

29:42.802 --> 29:59.061
I told Mother that I would need

29:42.802 --> 29:59.061
her help with addresses and she said what for and I 
told her that I was that Joe and I were getting

29:59.463 --> 30:08.632
married on June 15.

30:12.616 --> 30:20.103
Her positive response and dad's smile were 
unforgettable signs of their acceptance.

30:26.750 --> 30:26.770
A warm feeling that lasts forever.

30:40.728 --> 30:58.191
So as I worked on Southern Presbyterians that 
year, wedding preparations were also in high

30:40.728 --> 30:58.191
priority as I went to North Carolina during spring 
break. and we prepared for the wedding.

31:04.434 --> 31:13.806
That event on June 15 at the First Presbyterian 
Church in Mebane, June 15, was by today's

31:04.434 --> 31:13.806
standards rather modest.

31:19.874 --> 31:28.465
The young bride and groom-to-be bought the 
flowers and arranged them themselves at the A

31:29.643 --> 31:44.427
friend of Joe's mother cooked the wedding cake, 
baked the wedding cake, and her sister Doris

31:29.643 --> 31:44.427
provided the music.

31:50.096 --> 31:54.182
Some of the Cooper River Blue Devils came to be in 
the wedding.

31:59.191 --> 32:15.149
And we went, we drove, before we drove to

31:59.191 --> 32:15.149
Williamsburg, Virginia for our wedding trip.

32:15.169 --> 32:27.983
Then came back to Montreat and spent the rest of the 
summer doing research before coming to Houston

32:15.169 --> 32:27.983
and renting a small apartment

32:31.085 --> 32:33.768
and I can't remember the name of the street.

32:39.575 --> 32:49.766
Jo enrolled at the University of Houston as an 
English major and took almost a full-time load

32:39.575 --> 32:49.766
each semester.

32:53.110 --> 32:59.337
Her schedule being limited only by our finances,

33:02.202 --> 33:13.397
and the time it took for her to get to and from the 
campus since we only had one vehicle.

33:13.417 --> 33:27.636
Finances, our income at that time included the GI 
Bill, about $150 a month, and an assistantship at

33:13.417 --> 33:27.636
Rice an arrangement which I did not know existed 
when I applied for admission in 1954. That

33:35.985 --> 33:46.016
total of about $300 a month paid our rent and 
allowed us to save some money.

33:52.824 --> 33:58.450
By our third year there, we were back at 410 Emerson 
where Joe cooked for Mrs. Forbes and the two of us

33:59.425 --> 34:12.145
and kept house because Mrs. Forbes was beginning 
to become a little more frail.

34:18.775 --> 34:24.083
As that year ended, as the 1958-59 year ended,

34:29.648 --> 34:33.613
we began to look for permanent employment.

34:36.217 --> 34:57.124
The first opportunity was to teach

34:36.217 --> 34:57.124
four introductory courses

34:36.217 --> 34:57.124
each semester at the junior college, which then 
operated downtown at night on the second floor of

34:59.230 --> 35:07.843
the central Houston YMCA.

35:11.368 --> 35:23.566
Compensation for that effort from 7 to 10 o'clock 
Monday through Thursday night would have been

35:11.368 --> 35:23.566
$2,400 for the nine-month year. Not an attractive 
sum.

35:29.842 --> 35:58.296
Then I

35:29.842 --> 35:58.296
was contacted about filling a one-year vacancy at 
Texas Southern, then

35:29.842 --> 35:58.296
the comparatively new, primarily black 
institution just north of the University of

35:59.238 --> 36:05.667
Houston when I visited with the dean of that 
institution.

36:09.392 --> 36:26.815
And he told me the pay would be $2,800 a month, 
$2,800 a year,

36:09.392 --> 36:26.815
and patted me on the back as he chuckled.

36:29.596 --> 36:33.562
you can be our token white boy for next year.

36:37.288 --> 36:57.679
A third possibility came at McNeese State College 
in Lake Charles, Louisiana,

36:37.288 --> 36:57.679
less than an hour east of Orange,

36:37.288 --> 36:57.679
where I applied.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.882
And apparently was a finalist.

37:08.845 --> 37:10.607
Where the pay would have been about. 3600 a year.

37:22.620 --> 37:23.181
Thankfully. Another phone call changed. 
everything for us.

37:38.958 --> 37:42.282
But first, a step backward. In the fall of 1958, one 
day in Dr. Vandiver's office, I overheard... I...

37:51.453 --> 37:57.720
Paul... Our conversation was interrupted by a 
phone call from College Station, Texas.

38:10.154 --> 38:26.138
During that conversation, I understood that

38:10.154 --> 38:26.138
Ralph Steen, the then deeply respected, the 
highly respected head of the history department

38:27.130 --> 38:44.949
at A&M, whose record as a historian of Texas was 
unequaled,

38:27.130 --> 38:44.949
had just been selected as the new president at 
Stephen F. Austin State College in Nacogdoches.

38:48.172 --> 38:52.817
He was calling Dr. Vandiver to ask if he had anyone 
who could come up

38:57.674 --> 39:03.381
and accept responsibility for his American 
history courses on that short notice.

39:06.424 --> 39:09.388
Dr. Vandiver recommended me and then hand me the 
phone.

39:15.074 --> 39:25.707
Soon,

39:15.074 --> 39:25.707
I expressed fear that since I had not yet passed my 
PhD preliminary exams, it might be imprudent for

39:27.560 --> 39:44.239
me to

39:27.560 --> 39:44.239
accept that temporary task, and so I respectfully 
declined Dr. Steen's offer.

39:44.259 --> 39:55.272
A few months later, Dr. Steen's successor as 
department head, Joseph Milton Nance, also

39:44.259 --> 39:55.272
called Vandiver.

39:59.099 --> 40:25.427
Again, Dr. Vandiver handed me the phone,

39:59.099 --> 40:25.427
and Dr. Nance told me that they were looking for 
someone to fill a one-year vacancy because one of

39:59.099 --> 40:25.427
their department members would be on leave at the 
University of Houston for the 1959-60

39:59.099 --> 40:25.427
academic year. The task would be teaching four 
survey sections in American history. And would I

40:35.365 --> 40:36.486
be interested? I told him that I would be. He 
inquired about when I could come up for an

40:38.369 --> 40:42.676
interview. A quick glance at my watch led to the 
response that it was then 10 o'clock. Would 2

40:52.670 --> 40:55.735
o'clock that afternoon be too late?

41:02.262 --> 41:11.971
With a bit of lightness in his voice, he accepted 
that suggestion and I drove up.

41:16.214 --> 41:24.061
We went to Nagel Hall and I entered a new world.

41:26.964 --> 41:31.948
Dr. Nance, a comparatively compact man, of medium 
height quickly demonstrated that he

41:33.768 --> 42:01.142
was serious and thorough in his

41:33.768 --> 42:01.142
task

41:33.768 --> 42:01.142
and thorough in his research. He already had 
obtained

42:02.641 --> 42:11.389
all the appropriate information about me.

42:15.253 --> 42:30.927
And within less than two hours, he told me that the 
job would be four sections of American history

42:15.253 --> 42:30.927
numbered in the Aggie system 105 and 106.

42:34.535 --> 42:54.758
with the reconstruction as the dividing, the 
period of reconstruction as the dividing point,

42:34.535 --> 42:54.758
that it would be a one-year assignment because 
John Hill

42:34.535 --> 42:54.758
was on leave at the University of Houston and was 
expected to return the following year. The pay

42:56.500 --> 43:02.787
would be $550 a month for nine months or He told

43:03.543 --> 43:30.934
me that he would get a letter to me soon,

43:03.543 --> 43:30.934
and when that epistle came, it required that I 
respond in writing within 48 hours, which I very

43:03.543 --> 43:30.934
gratefully and proudly did. And we began to make 
our plans

43:33.243 --> 43:43.953
for a year in Aggieland.

43:43.973 --> 43:54.123
Another Aggie link

43:43.973 --> 43:54.123
came quickly.

43:56.445 --> 44:00.229
And once more, Dr. Vandiver was a key helper. when 
the dean of Shriner College, S-C-H-R-E-I-N-E-R,

44:02.318 --> 44:29.552
Shriner Institute in Kerrville,

44:02.318 --> 44:29.552
called to

44:02.318 --> 44:29.552
seek

44:02.318 --> 44:29.552
a summer, a teacher for the summer session only.

44:29.973 --> 44:31.735
This vacancy was created

44:35.815 --> 44:47.066
when an old Austin college buddy, Ed Wilburn, was 
going to be on leave finishing his master's

44:35.815 --> 44:47.066
degree.

44:54.614 --> 45:01.941
A few telephones and letters

44:54.614 --> 45:01.941
were exchanged with Dean H. C. Weir, W-E-I-R,

45:03.406 --> 45:15.564
who was Dean of the Institute and in fact directed 
its actions on the daily basis.

45:18.769 --> 45:31.168
By this time, Joe was expecting our first child

45:18.769 --> 45:31.168
and as we drove out for the interview with Dean 
Weir,

45:35.283 --> 45:58.084
The

45:35.283 --> 45:58.084
obstetrician who was assisting, who was caring 
for Joe, recommended that we stop every hour for

45:35.283 --> 45:58.084
her to quote stretch her legs and relax from 
sitting in the car.

46:00.747 --> 46:19.865
One of those stops, we made one of those stops just 
inside the cattle guard of a ranch west of Austin

46:00.747 --> 46:19.865
where she took off her shoes and cooled her feet in 
the water standing underneath a little bridge.

46:22.327 --> 46:30.535
Quickly, a pickup came our way, a pickup truck came 
our way, and the man told us that we'd have to move

46:31.122 --> 46:54.379
because we were on, we were intruding

46:31.122 --> 46:54.379
in the pasture of the LBJ Ranch and that

46:31.122 --> 46:54.379
we should not invade the privacy of Senator 
Johnson.

47:02.560 --> 47:08.267
The weeks at Shriner were totally enjoyable.
