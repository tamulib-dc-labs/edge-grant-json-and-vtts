It's going to be the graduate work. Even if, say, 
undergraduate changes drastically, won't there

00:05.632 --> 00:11.339
always be the graduate? Well,

00:13.162 --> 00:17.307
might be. But even on certification for 
administration, you see, there are some

00:17.327 --> 00:23.594
alternative routes. And

00:29.495 --> 00:35.963
Oh, I think we face that as to whether we really are 
functional, whether we really serve a purpose or

00:29.495 --> 00:35.963
not. But what I started out to say was it seems to me 
that there are changes in the teaching function at

00:36.343 --> 00:55.587
the elementary and secondary level, that the way 
in which information is handled, information

00:36.343 --> 00:55.587
management systems and so on. that's affecting 
the way in which people function in elementary and

00:57.423 --> 01:02.969
secondary education. And I think the important 
thing that we have to do is to be able to change our

01:04.331 --> 01:26.215
own operation and to function in a manner that's 
consistent, not expecting that they are doing it

01:04.331 --> 01:26.215
because we are teaching them how to do it. we lead by 
running to catch up. But I think the computerized

01:31.202 --> 01:41.838
methods of handling data certainly has changed 
this department a lot already. We have some

01:42.879 --> 01:53.214
activities going on that build on this and perhaps 
may make some important contributions. And so I

01:53.234 --> 01:55.898
think Well, I think the way each of us as faculty 
members relate to our own students

01:57.667 --> 02:08.237
is quite different than it was 20 years ago. And I 
think it will be in another 15, 20. Can you just

02:12.281 --> 02:19.527
briefly expand on that a little bit?

02:19.548 --> 02:27.555
Well,

02:19.548 --> 02:27.555
we hear people using this, the label facilitator 
of learning. And maybe this has always been more

02:27.923 --> 02:57.643
true in graduate education, but I think we still 
are moving in the direction of faculty members

02:27.923 --> 02:57.643
trying to suggest how or where information and 
skills may come from, rather than the assumption

02:27.923 --> 02:57.643
that some way or other we personally can be 
responsible for that learning or that skill

02:27.923 --> 02:57.643
development. And that will increase, you think? I 
think so. I think it has to. Is there one last little

03:05.633 --> 03:13.363
anecdote or one last memoir, something that you 
might remember that stands out? I know it's been a

03:14.245 --> 03:15.927
long time. I don't know about any one thing. You're 
thinking primarily in terms of the college

03:23.397 --> 03:27.142
itself. True. Are we within your department? Are 
you personally? I

03:30.886 --> 03:37.794
can't think of any one thing. There's so many. 
There are lots. Have you ever written anything? Do

03:41.959 --> 03:44.603
you have anything that you have kept over the 
years? Any kind of diaries? No. No? You have

03:48.527 --> 03:49.208
nothing? No. Well, Dr. Hawkins, this has been very 
enjoyable, and I thank you for your time, and I look

03:50.910 --> 03:57.178
forward to visiting with you.
