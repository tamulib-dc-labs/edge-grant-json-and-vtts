WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:21.759
The courses, like statistics, were important 
because it's the foundation on which what we call

00:02.832 --> 00:21.759
forest maturation is

00:02.832 --> 00:21.759
built. And soils and economics,

00:21.779 --> 00:31.894
plant physiology, Those sorts of things were key, 
and those were courses that were taken outside the

00:32.920 --> 00:42.002
department. But you end up in forestry having 
about four or five what we call core courses. One of

00:49.514 --> 00:55.020
them is, well, ecology would be another external 
course. But if you have about four or five core

00:55.041 --> 01:10.639
courses, then that includes silviculture,

00:55.041 --> 01:10.639
mensuration, management,

01:11.041 --> 01:20.853
whatever you call your wood technology course, 
and forest economics. If you had all of the faculty

01:20.873 --> 01:34.990
members from those years, both in required 
courses in the department and outside the

01:20.873 --> 01:34.990
department, and they were all lined up, which ones 
would you want to thank most? Well, there

01:35.729 --> 01:48.452
were two people that were here when I came. Bob 
Rhodes, who was a... totally devoted person to

01:55.237 --> 01:59.523
students. I mean, there was a stream of students 
coming in his office all the time. And he served a

02:04.169 --> 02:17.346
valuable role because he taught dendrology and 
those kind of courses, ecology and those kind of

02:04.169 --> 02:17.346
courses. But certainly, he played a major role. 
Dave Mooring. would be

02:22.253 --> 02:29.428
the other one that I would identify. He just spent 
an inordinate amount of time carried a heavy

02:31.872 --> 02:37.824
research load, but spent an inordinate amount of 
time with students. And he'd haul those kids to

02:37.845 --> 02:50.170
East Texas, you know, all for, you know, come back 
in the middle of the night and this sort of thing.

02:50.190 --> 02:51.734
And I was really devoted to him. In fact, When he 
left us with the Mississippi State in a few years,

02:52.983 --> 03:14.504
he was on their school forest

02:52.983 --> 03:14.504
and had

02:52.983 --> 03:14.504
a heart attack. Were there some people teaching 
courses outside the department that did an

03:14.524 --> 03:16.307
excellent job? Yeah, your chemistry, biology, 
economics.

03:33.286 --> 03:36.950
All right, what about the advising and the 
counseling? Who are the people that

03:36.970 --> 03:42.396
undergraduates in forest science would turn to? 
Well, Roach. What about at the college level?

03:51.978 --> 03:59.287
I guess Dick Pops was over

03:51.978 --> 03:59.287
there one day. But that's who they talked to. Do you 
have any good student anecdotes to share? Serious

04:07.517 --> 04:13.665
or not so serious as far as science and student 
stories? Well, a lot of those sort of things come

04:14.646 --> 04:21.394
out of either field trips or our summer camp. We 
have a summer program where we take them to East

04:23.635 --> 04:39.282
Texas

04:23.635 --> 04:39.282
for a period of weeks and keep them there. and do a 
lot of the field work that is related to the theory

04:39.802 --> 04:48.810
that they get in their courses over here. And they 
live,

04:48.830 --> 05:03.103
we've had them over at Huntsville at San Houston 
Dorm. We've had them out on the San Houston

05:03.123 --> 05:08.188
National Forest I think it was an old job course 
center. And right now, they share the East Texas

05:13.095 --> 05:24.493
Conservation Center that Stephen F. Austin owns 
over on Lake Sam Rayburn. But anyway, they live in

05:24.513 --> 05:33.086
an outdoor, fairly rudimentary situation. And 
those are always... fertile ground for problems

05:37.868 --> 05:44.243
and interesting stories. I do recall one time when 
one of our, when we were finishing up the summer

05:44.263 --> 05:56.350
camp, it was the last day and we had a big and

05:58.372 --> 06:18.583
so

05:58.372 --> 06:18.583
on down in front of the lakes on

05:58.372 --> 06:18.583
St. Houston National Forest. And there was a fair 
amount of beer drinking going on, and everybody

06:18.603 --> 06:20.987
got thrown in the lake, including all the faculty. 
And after we got through this, one of the students

06:21.007 --> 06:23.451
said, I lost my ID risk. And so we, it was pitch dark 
then. We kind of looked around a little bit and

06:29.940 --> 06:33.346
couldn't find it. And the next day, he came out 
there. He and some others came out and started

06:40.238 --> 06:45.688
looking around the edge of the lake there. And 
then...

06:48.862 --> 07:00.653
was sitting there in about six inches of water, I 
guess, at least enough to where it was clearly

06:48.862 --> 07:00.653
visible. And you talk about one happy son.

07:09.641 --> 07:10.101
He was really pleased. Another Aggie Ring story. 
We had, A&M had a big contract which

07:16.908 --> 07:30.341
you probably

07:16.908 --> 07:30.341
remember with the Dominican Republic. And it 
involved several things, but one of them was to

07:30.361 --> 07:38.028
bring students up here and give them degrees. We 
had, I don't know, four or five Dominican students

07:38.048 --> 07:41.091
in forestry. And they did okay and got out. and went 
back to the Dominican. And Owens, Illinois had an

07:48.547 --> 07:54.136
operation down there in the Dominican. And one of 
them went to work for Owens, Illinois. And anyway,

07:58.884 --> 08:04.073
somewhere in the woods of the Dominican, he lost 
his baggy ring. So the vice president for Owens,

08:05.515 --> 08:09.662
Illinois,

08:12.663 --> 08:18.911
operation, called me up one day and says, how do you 
get an Aggie ring? I said, well, it takes about four

08:19.512 --> 08:22.716
years. He said, no. He said, then he told me the 
story. I can't think of his kid's name

08:29.024 --> 08:35.452
now. I think he had something like that. he's a lot

09:10.342 --> 09:23.923
Did you feel

09:10.342 --> 09:23.923
that you all were given, compared to the other 
departments in agriculture, were you all given

09:10.342 --> 09:23.923
equitable treatment? Well, you'll never get a 
department head

09:23.943 --> 09:31.915
to admit that. That's what I thought. Whose budget 
do you wish you could have had, and which

09:35.720 --> 09:38.104
departments? Well,

09:40.649 --> 09:50.480
just let me name the department heads. And then 
you, O.D. Butler,

09:52.922 --> 10:04.995
Perry Atkinson, entomology, Ty Timm, ag 
economics. Those guys always seem to do well. The

10:07.198 --> 10:09.340
other one that did well was was Morris Bloodworth. 
He was . I'd say those four probably prospered

10:16.500 --> 10:25.408
during my period as department head. Then when I 
went over to the experiment station, and Neville

10:25.428 --> 10:40.221
Clark showed up over there, and we started looking 
at the books, we found out why.

10:42.445 --> 10:53.322
They basically put together two budgets.

10:53.342 --> 10:55.205
I don't know that Ty Pinn was, I think Ty was already 
out of the picture by then, but anyway. But

10:55.225 --> 10:58.089
certainly Perry and O.D. and Morris. And then 
Jarvis

11:01.755 --> 11:10.528
would, you know, pay the budgets, they'd go 
through the board and the whole bit. They'd come

11:11.200 --> 11:12.641
back over and out. Jarvis, here's our real budget.

11:18.067 --> 11:28.257
So I

11:18.067 --> 11:28.257
found out that all department heads were not 
created equal. During those days, you, as

11:29.659 --> 11:38.448
department head, you were not the chairman. You 
were the head. Did you all,

11:40.057 --> 11:56.491
in those days, in that department, were salaries 
and promotions on a percentage basis, or were they

11:40.057 --> 11:56.491
all on a merit basis?

11:56.852 --> 12:09.743
Well, they were all on a, for the most part, unless 
we got told that everybody gets 3% or 5% or

11:56.852 --> 12:09.743
whatever, they were on a merit basis. But in those 
days also, you will recall that the department

12:10.718 --> 12:19.609
head was lowered. Faculty governments

12:19.629 --> 12:26.418
didn't exist. So whatever I felt like those guys 
deserved, promotions were a bit different

12:26.438 --> 12:38.413
because that was another more

12:48.468 --> 13:15.623
and

12:48.468 --> 13:15.623
then you have

12:48.468 --> 13:15.623
to go defend them without mentioning any 
significant pain do you remember during that

12:48.468 --> 13:15.623
period any situation where you lost somebody 
because Another

13:15.957 --> 13:30.314
school just outbid them and took somebody away 
that you wanted to keep. I'd say Goldstein, and

13:30.334 --> 13:42.808
more in chief probably, but they offered

13:30.334 --> 13:42.808
Goldstein as the head of the big department of NC 
State, so that was a bit of a different deal. Others

13:43.379 --> 14:12.070
that we lost of that early group,

13:43.379 --> 14:12.070
I don't recall. And we made some counteroffers

14:12.320 --> 14:23.926
in the United States. You mentioned faculty 
government and so forth. Based on your experience

14:26.632 --> 14:31.864
of more than three decades, if you were the 
dictator and didn't have to explain it to any

14:26.632 --> 14:31.864
committee or any voters, What role would you have 
the faculty play in a department today that wants

14:33.430 --> 14:53.544
to make real progress in terms of what role would 
the faculty play in salary increases and so forth

14:33.430 --> 14:53.544
and evaluation of the capability of faculty? I 
think the faculty. principle and probably the

14:55.013 --> 15:06.387
most important role is in the promotion

14:55.013 --> 15:06.387
and tenure process. I think that's clear that 
their involvement

15:06.407 --> 15:16.519
there is important to maintaining standards and 
this sort of thing. I'm not convinced that

15:21.811 --> 15:27.763
resource allocation is something that they do 
very well. There's always a greed factor there

15:27.783 --> 15:38.824
that creeps into almost anything you do like that. 
Most recently, when I was interim department head

15:39.310 --> 16:00.947
for about 18 months over there, we had some funds 
that were centrally held and could be allocated

15:39.310 --> 16:00.947
for graduate programs, for teaching equipment.

16:05.483 --> 16:21.387
Previous department head had a committee of 
faculty to do that,

16:05.483 --> 16:21.387
and I thought that was fine. I thought that was the 
best way. There wasn't a whole lot of money

16:22.068 --> 16:23.370
involved, but it was still fun. But routine 
resource allocation, take input wherever you can

16:23.390 --> 16:32.824
get it, But there is a process that we have that

16:42.760 --> 16:50.891
is probably not practiced as religiously as it 
should be,

16:42.760 --> 16:50.891
and that's performance appraisal. And if you do a 
good

16:50.911 --> 17:09.835
job of performance

16:50.911 --> 17:09.835
appraisal, and the faculty are responsive to 
that, I mean, they commit themselves to

16:50.911 --> 17:09.835
that, then I think you get a pretty good reading on 
it. And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to

17:09.855 --> 17:11.097
figure out who the, achievers are and who are not. 
Of course, you run into

17:16.738 --> 17:39.461
a problem

17:16.738 --> 17:39.461
where you have a high achiever who's a son of a 
bitch. And that's just a very frustrating thing to

17:39.481 --> 17:40.562
deal with. But there are those people who are that 
way. And in a few instances, you have somebody who

17:42.970 --> 17:55.874
is extremely convenient, extremely pleasant, 
always glad-handed, but not very productive

17:42.970 --> 17:55.874
enough. And then one of my frustrations with some 
faculty committees is that they don't assume

17:55.894 --> 18:06.413
enough responsibility for the results of their 
decisions. for example, a search committee that

18:07.996 --> 18:15.325
hires some key person, they then walk away. Right. 
And somebody else is responsible to leave with the

18:16.287 --> 18:19.190
consequences of that force. All right. So let's 
make believe there are 40 to 50 forestry programs.

18:27.581 --> 18:30.004
And 30 years ago, A&M was a beginner. in that 40-50, 
just getting started. At the time you moved away

18:34.365 --> 18:47.149
from the department headship, where would you 
have placed A&M in that 40-50, in the top or bottom,

18:34.365 --> 18:47.149
divided into some kind of percentiles? Oh, I would 
say we were around the middle of somewhere. We went

18:56.275 --> 19:09.830
up, though, in a few years and probably peaked when 
Charles Lee was head of the department. He was a

19:09.850 --> 19:14.975
very

19:09.850 --> 19:14.975
good department. We recruited him from 
Mississippi State. Did he follow you? Well, no,

19:18.668 --> 19:26.776
there was a guy between us who was a loser, and so we 
lost the road. Where did Lee come from? He came in

19:29.018 --> 19:33.462
the early 80s. I left in 77, and then we had

19:33.482 --> 19:48.557
this guy in Penn State that came for about three or 
four years, and he just didn't work out. But when

19:49.516 --> 19:54.342
Charlie came, that department flourished. And he 
probably stayed there until, oh, 1988 or 89,

19:55.883 --> 20:05.875
somewhere along in there. And during that period 
of time, the department was probably in the top

20:07.056 --> 20:12.182
25%.

20:14.930 --> 20:19.475
No,

20:14.930 --> 20:19.475
they've lost Graham. And again, there's been

20:20.617 --> 20:37.497
a lot of slippage in keeping the department head 
position moving. You get a guy in there that the

20:37.517 --> 20:41.882
administration doesn't feel good about, and the 
department starts to slip, and he senses that, and

20:42.571 --> 20:53.885
faculty begins to sense, and then finally they 
decide to do something about it. Well, you know,

20:53.905 --> 21:05.340
that's several years,

20:53.905 --> 21:05.340
and then there's

20:53.905 --> 21:05.340
a long, you know, go find somebody else. There's a 
good department head in there now. He's

21:09.082 --> 21:27.563
kind of new to

21:09.082 --> 21:27.563
the game, but he's going to be super. And I see the 
department coming back. In a theoretically

21:28.344 --> 21:30.887
perfect arrangement, would a department head be 
hired with a specific term, four-year,

21:28.344 --> 21:30.887
five-year, renewable? Well, I think that's the 
case now. They get a two-year review from there,

21:37.364 --> 21:50.008
and then a four-year

21:37.364 --> 21:50.008
review that's more comprehensive, and then 
another four-year review.

21:52.893 --> 21:56.520
Most of the department heads in agriculture tend 
to make careers out of being department heads.

21:59.788 --> 22:06.154
That's not quite so much the case now as it was 20 
years ago. But look at OD and so on. So the review

22:14.503 --> 22:17.726
process is important. But more important than 
that is some sort of timely action. timely

22:22.505 --> 22:46.838
action if there's a problem. Because the 
department can slip so bad. I've wondered also,

22:47.659 --> 22:48.701
what is your opinion about this? Most 
departments, when they lose through retirement,

22:48.721 --> 22:52.005
death, or going somewhere else, the top-notch 
senior person tend to fill that with a junior

22:48.721 --> 22:52.005
person, a beginner. Is that good to do that 
normally? Does that keep the prestige of the

22:58.541 --> 23:02.365
department high? Or should they try on occasion to 
hire a top-notch senior person? Well, I think it's

23:08.291 --> 23:21.165
certainly, from the department perspective, 
it's good to go get if that's an area that you want to

23:21.382 --> 23:31.524
continue to emphasize to get a good person and a 
senior person in that position. But what's

23:31.544 --> 23:40.504
happening now is you get so much salary erosion 
that you can't afford to go higher. a

23:40.484 --> 24:02.771
good person

23:40.484 --> 24:02.771
because you know what it takes to go out on the 
market these days and try to hire somebody, a

23:40.484 --> 24:02.771
senior person. And most departments can't afford 
to do that. I've talked to the way the big, old,

24:03.712 --> 24:05.935
high-level schools, the old projects, they've 
got million-dollar positions

24:19.921 --> 24:29.836
institution

24:19.921 --> 24:29.836
in that specialty. And

24:29.856 --> 24:41.554
we,

24:29.856 --> 24:41.554
as public schools,

24:29.856 --> 24:41.554
don't do that as well. But because of, and again, 
you mentioned the funding issue. I found in some

24:42.776 --> 24:46.722
cases, the faculty in the department thinks, oh, 
if this person who left is making a big salary, if we

24:42.776 --> 24:46.722
fill it with a person with a mighty salary, we'll 
get to keep that difference. So we told them, no.

24:51.173 --> 24:54.396
All

24:51.173 --> 24:54.396
right. You go over to the experiment station after 
eight years. What attracted you there? Well, it

25:03.524 --> 25:08.789
was kind of a false attraction.

25:11.311 --> 25:19.999
The department heads in brain science and 
wildlife and fisheries and recreation and parks

25:11.311 --> 25:19.999
and forestry had been plotting since I came to form 
a school of that

25:21.295 --> 25:30.305
nature. And there's precedent for that all over 
the West.

25:35.590 --> 25:41.957
And so we had made a proposal to do that. And Jack 
Williams, when it got to his desk, says,

25:42.257 --> 25:50.526
coordinating board's not entertaining any new 
organizational units at this time. Let's run this

25:54.257 --> 25:58.226
up a flagpole. So John Calhoun sent a letter back to 
Harry and said, in fact Jack said, why don't you do

25:58.246 --> 26:10.253
something we can do internally? to identify this 
group of departments the way they want the

26:11.009 --> 26:19.640
identity. And so the idea was to form an institute 
of renewable natural resources. That's what we

26:26.569 --> 26:28.091
did. And then I was going to go over and be the 
director of it. Well, about the time I headed over

26:33.477 --> 26:38.704
there, Jarvis

26:39.477 --> 26:49.226
moved to the president's

26:39.477 --> 26:49.226
office. Neville Carr came in as director of the 
Experiment Station. And I literally got

26:50.447 --> 26:59.835
submerged in the Experiment Station business. 
And was never really able to lift

26:59.855 --> 27:08.303
the Institute out of the organizational mire. And 
that's been going on ever since. And that's still a

27:14.791 --> 27:17.355
topic of discussion. I saw it on the agenda of a 
meeting that we had here in the Ag Program

27:18.056 --> 27:28.912
Conference a couple of weeks ago. And Bob Brown, 
who's head of Wildlife and Fisheries now, was sort

27:28.932 --> 27:38.526
of a daddy rabbit to try to do something about that.

27:40.312 --> 27:52.827
So

27:40.312 --> 27:52.827
that's the reason I went over there, but it never 
materialized.

27:52.847 --> 27:52.967
Right. And your title when you go to the 
conversation was what? Associate Director.

27:57.252 --> 27:57.633
Associate Director. And you served in the 
Associate Director of? For about...

28:08.628 --> 28:14.817
Describe

28:08.628 --> 28:14.817
your duties. Well,

28:14.837 --> 28:32.764
I primarily, I had

28:14.837 --> 28:32.764
some budget

28:14.837 --> 28:32.764
responsibilities. Facilities were almost all 
mine. Programatically, Neville and I sort of We

28:38.362 --> 28:56.620
did that together

28:38.362 --> 28:56.620
with the part of the agency that served him. The 
building behind him, he stayed on the road for a

28:56.640 --> 28:57.923
great deal. He was very active in that way.

29:06.104 --> 29:29.711
and

29:06.104 --> 29:29.711
built in behind

29:06.104 --> 29:29.711
him

29:06.104 --> 29:29.711
. But budget and facilities and programs, I guess, 
were my primary activities. During those 11

29:31.273 --> 29:32.955
years, give some examples of some of the big 
decisions you remember.

29:37.103 --> 30:06.216
Well,

29:37.103 --> 30:06.216
I think probably the most significant thing that 
we did was make a major run at the legislature in

29:37.103 --> 30:06.216
1983

29:37.103 --> 30:06.216
for a substantial amount of money across probably 
six or eight different programs. One of them was

30:07.040 --> 30:11.965
called Biotechnology

30:07.040 --> 30:11.965
Factory. And we were successful, almost totally 
successful. And with that, those resources, and

30:19.432 --> 30:33.205
that was about the last year we had with the 
legislature, because you remember in 85, oil had

30:19.432 --> 30:33.205
gone south. And it was, you know, Mark White was 
whacking at us and so it was pretty tough sledding

30:36.925 --> 30:41.970
going on. So we got in on the last good year. But that 
money was put together in a central pool and used as

30:46.355 --> 31:05.875
a competitive grants program for people in the 
extermination station to start building

30:46.355 --> 31:05.875
programs in six or eight areas that we had 
identified. And certainly where we are now with

31:06.912 --> 31:16.990
molecular biology is largely due to that state 
investment. that was made, which was about $2

31:17.493 --> 31:24.464
million in the biotechnology program. And we 
recruited Gene Sander then for biochemistry and

31:24.484 --> 31:33.979
some new hires there. We made the decision that we 
would not create a central biotechnology center

31:34.219 --> 31:45.677
like a lot of universities
