WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:12.343
July 13, 1998, testing to see if the machine is working, now in San Antonio.

00:14.886 --> 00:18.610
Okay, this is July 13.

00:18.630 --> 00:28.583
I have the pleasure of interviewing Jerry Bowles, the president-elect of the Association of Former Students, and I believe you're from a class of 71.

00:28.643 --> 00:30.365
Yes, sir.

00:30.385 --> 00:32.468
Why did you attend A&M in the first place?

00:33.089 --> 00:36.053
I didn't have a lot of choice, to tell you the truth.

00:36.734 --> 00:37.436
I was very lucky.

00:37.536 --> 00:39.398
I was sent to A&M by my uncle.

00:39.699 --> 00:42.103
I had an uncle in Beaumont, Jerry Hogan.

00:42.123 --> 00:43.204
I was his namesake.

00:43.244 --> 00:56.364
He did not attend college, but he had a couple of nephews that went to A&M, and he just thought that an A&M man probably had a better chance at life, maybe, than some others did.

00:56.384 --> 00:59.509
So, like I say, I was very fortunate.

00:59.709 --> 01:01.071
He sent me to Texas A&M.

01:01.675 --> 01:10.551
I respected him very much and I remember one day telling him that I had to date this girl and she was going to TU and I said, well, I might go up there.

01:10.791 --> 01:11.613
He said, I don't think so.

01:13.035 --> 01:14.358
Anyway, that's how I got there.

01:14.939 --> 01:17.243
You had visited College Station before coming to?

01:17.463 --> 01:18.906
Only one time.

01:19.567 --> 01:25.337
I was with some people and they had some relative that lived in College Station.

01:25.773 --> 01:33.521
We stopped in there to see them and their son, I don't even remember their names at this time, gave me a quick tour of A&M.

01:33.541 --> 01:35.163
This was probably about 1965.

01:36.544 --> 01:38.246
Did it make any impression on you?

01:38.987 --> 01:40.809
Yeah, I knew I was going there.

01:41.089 --> 01:49.958
So, you know, I was, the campus at that time was not, to me, near as impressive as it is now.

01:50.275 --> 01:55.301
And I'm sure that has to do with a lot of the development there, plus maybe some maturity on my part.

01:55.321 --> 01:57.024
All right.

01:58.025 --> 02:02.691
Describe the trip then when you leave home to come to enroll.

02:02.751 --> 02:03.992
How did you get there?

02:04.032 --> 02:05.134
What did you bring?

02:05.234 --> 02:05.895
Who brought you?

02:07.437 --> 02:12.083
Well, we left Port Natchez.

02:14.005 --> 02:18.831
And my mom and dad went, and my aunt and uncle went, the uncle and aunt that sent me in.

02:19.790 --> 02:30.701
And I pretty much followed, I guess, my list of what to bring, you know, a couple collared shirts and some long pants and, you know, the regular things.

02:30.941 --> 02:35.145
And I guess a suitcase full was probably what I had.

02:35.165 --> 02:42.352
So in those days, you registered the day you got there.

02:43.173 --> 02:48.278
There was a, I'm rambling here, but there was a brief orientation in the summer.

02:48.730 --> 02:58.645
I went up for that and that's when they, I think it was primarily for the guys that were going in the Corps.

02:58.665 --> 03:00.828
Signed you your outfit and all this kind of stuff.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.831
So when I got there I knew which outfit I was going to.

03:02.852 --> 03:06.076
Anyway, in those days you could drive into the Quad.

03:06.958 --> 03:12.226
So we drove into the Quad and let me start over here.

03:12.306 --> 03:13.708
We hadn't got to the Quad yet.

03:14.144 --> 03:19.071
I had my list of what to do, so we went to Cebisa and registered.

03:20.813 --> 03:22.075
I was going to be an engineer.

03:23.176 --> 03:26.681
That didn't last too long, but anyway I did the register as an engineer.

03:27.302 --> 03:40.219
We got the courses set up, went and bought the books, my uncle wrote the checks, and for some reason I remember it was about $600 we spent there in a few minutes.

03:41.279 --> 03:50.307
So then they took me to, I guess from there we went to the Quad.

03:50.328 --> 03:55.592
And I knew I was living in dorm 3, wasn't too sure where 3 was, but we found out quick enough.

03:55.612 --> 04:01.378
And they deposited me at the west end of dorm 3 at the end door.

04:01.398 --> 04:11.067
So I had my bag, and of course everybody was saying goodbye, which was kind of a tearful departure, and I'm sure that was pretty common with everyone.

04:11.688 --> 04:13.090
My mother wouldn't get out of the car.

04:14.531 --> 04:18.776
Anyway, I walked in the end door going three and I soon found out that was a senior privilege.

04:19.637 --> 04:22.300
That's kind of how we got there.

04:23.021 --> 04:28.608
Let's see, describe the campus as you remember it when you arrived, physically.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.751
Well to me it was a huge place.

04:32.011 --> 04:37.678
I came from a town of 8,000 people and at that time

04:37.962 --> 04:42.789
If I remember the numbers correctly, there was about 9,500 students at A&M.

04:43.950 --> 04:50.760
I was overwhelmed by the fact there were more people going to school there than there were in the town that I grew up in.

04:51.140 --> 04:54.605
It was a big place and to me somewhat intimidating.

04:55.366 --> 04:57.529
You learn your way around pretty quick, you know.

04:57.549 --> 05:01.915
What were the landmarks that you kind of used as gauges?

05:01.935 --> 05:04.979
I don't know.

05:04.999 --> 05:05.640
I guess...

05:06.380 --> 05:09.263
Some of our campusology dictated some of that, you know.

05:09.283 --> 05:13.688
You had Sully over by the academic building.

05:16.070 --> 05:19.814
As far as particular landmarks, I don't really remember.

05:19.834 --> 05:31.046
The MSC, of course, was the central place on campus and you spent as much time there as you possibly could because as a fish you were fairly safe there.

05:31.126 --> 05:33.068
We ate all our meals in Duncan.

05:33.108 --> 05:35.290
You had basically three meals a day there.

05:35.725 --> 05:42.832
and that was all paid for and really didn't have a lot of money to spend to be elsewhere.

05:45.654 --> 05:47.636
Talk about what it was like to be a fish.

05:49.418 --> 05:56.004
Oh, I wasn't prepared for it.

05:56.024 --> 05:59.027
It was a pretty, I would say, awesome experience.

06:00.268 --> 06:02.530
The outfit I was in was a large outfit.

06:02.550 --> 06:04.092
It was A battery, A2.

06:04.152 --> 06:05.513
We were in the 2nd Brigade.

06:06.252 --> 06:14.524
And we had well over 100 people, probably 130, 140 in the outfit.

06:14.544 --> 06:20.993
The fish class itself, we had 61 or 62 guys, so it was a large fish class.

06:22.174 --> 06:28.303
And I knew a little bit about A&M before I got there, but not a whole lot.

06:30.045 --> 06:31.668
Of course, I didn't know anything about military.

06:31.688 --> 06:35.533
I hadn't grown up in any type of a military environment.

06:35.918 --> 06:43.285
I remember sitting at, you know, you show up, you meet your CO, you're told we'll get a haircut, the one you came up with wasn't quite good enough.

06:43.305 --> 06:54.735
So we got that done, and I remember sitting in the hallway, and I'm pretty sure it was the first night, there in our collared shirts, our long pants, our tie shoes, and belts and everything.

06:54.755 --> 07:02.042
That's when they give us the old speech, you know, look left and look right, you know, one out of three of you is going to be here at the end of four years.

07:02.062 --> 07:04.744
It was a pretty accurate statement.

07:06.057 --> 07:14.327
I was always, what I want to say, I don't want to say reclusive or shy or whatever, but not real outgoing.

07:15.689 --> 07:22.537
The thing about being in the Corps was it made you make friends, which is the best thing that ever happened to me.

07:22.797 --> 07:27.042
All of a sudden you've got 40 or 50 or 60 of your best friends.

07:27.062 --> 07:28.324
Everybody knows each other.

07:28.684 --> 07:30.547
You've got a common bond.

07:31.027 --> 07:35.052
Was your official lady a special, did he become a special friend?

07:35.369 --> 07:47.830
No, the first fish old lady I had, he left school after our fish year.

07:48.331 --> 07:53.520
My best friend though became my fish old lady at the beginning of the second semester.

07:53.941 --> 07:57.647
His name is Keith Wingate, he lives in New Braunfels and we're like brothers.

07:58.049 --> 08:01.573
And we lived together the rest of our time.

08:01.613 --> 08:05.859
He got married at the end of our junior year, and he found a better roommate.

08:05.879 --> 08:15.972
So anyway, the first one was kind of a fleeting relationship, and then Keith and I were the very best of friends.

08:16.012 --> 08:19.076
Our wives are friends, our kids are friends.

08:19.376 --> 08:22.760
Describe your freshman room physically.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.842
What was in there?

08:24.923 --> 08:25.544
What was it?

08:25.984 --> 08:26.605
Pretty stark.

08:26.905 --> 08:34.034
We had a bunk bed, we had a couple of desks and chairs and a sink.

08:34.054 --> 08:34.715
That was it.

08:34.855 --> 08:38.860
It was before they put the consoles in the rooms or the shelves in the rooms.

08:38.940 --> 08:40.222
We didn't have telephones.

08:42.124 --> 08:49.834
That year was the, I believe, the first year that the Duncan area dorms were air conditioned.

08:49.854 --> 08:51.436
And they worked pretty good.

08:52.878 --> 08:56.322
We were engineers, we always thought that we could soup them up and make them work better.

08:56.622 --> 08:58.805
Well, we never did, but we worked on them a lot.

08:58.825 --> 09:01.749
I'm sure the maintenance people really appreciated all that help we gave them.

09:02.670 --> 09:03.691
But the rooms were stark.

09:03.771 --> 09:09.358
The floors were tile, concrete walls, kind of a gray color.

09:09.378 --> 09:14.385
I think pretty much the same as they are now, except they are spiffed up a little bit now.

09:14.405 --> 09:15.827
We had no telephones in our rooms.

09:16.167 --> 09:17.950
Did you have any decorations on the walls?

09:18.250 --> 09:19.812
No, you had a bulletin board.

09:19.832 --> 09:23.637
And as a freshman, there were certain things you could have on your bulletin board.

09:23.657 --> 09:25.279
It was all regulated.

09:25.630 --> 09:27.672
There was really nothing on the walls.

09:27.693 --> 09:35.702
Describe a typical, from start to finish, a typical day, class day for you.

09:35.782 --> 09:36.623
What time did you get up?

09:37.084 --> 09:41.750
Where did you do whatever you did during that class day?

09:42.210 --> 09:46.075
The first call was at 6 o'clock.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.942
If you were not the whistle jock, you could probably

09:52.360 --> 10:08.323
bag in until 6 and then you had like 15 minutes as I recall to get up and get dressed and be on the wall in the hall at 6.20 or 6.30.

10:08.424 --> 10:19.600
And of course when that happened you were inspected by the sophomores through brass shoes, hair, and basically harassed for about 15 minutes.

10:20.339 --> 10:23.684
They'd go over your campusology questions and all that stuff.

10:23.724 --> 10:29.652
Then we'd walk out outside the formation, march to chow, try to eat.

10:29.672 --> 10:32.376
Yep, you got harassed at all the meals.

10:32.396 --> 10:35.200
Anyway, come back from chow, came back on your own.

10:35.381 --> 10:39.006
We went to Duncan as an outfit.

10:39.026 --> 10:40.708
The whole court marched to chow.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.955
Come back to the dorms, and there were details.

10:44.975 --> 10:47.378
Probably not unlike you might have at home today.

10:47.418 --> 10:48.760
You know, things have to be cleaned up.

10:49.195 --> 10:54.023
The hall had to be swept, the trash would put up and all that kind of thing.

10:54.043 --> 10:58.792
Then every day your room had to be ready for inspection.

10:58.812 --> 11:00.996
And then first class was 8 o'clock.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.864
And as I recall class was pretty much all day.

11:05.924 --> 11:12.115
You might have an hour break in the afternoon between classes.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.847
There were no classes at noontimes.

11:14.907 --> 11:17.690
Everybody came back to the Duncan area, to the quad.

11:17.811 --> 11:26.600
There again, we'd get in our rooms, you have all your calls for chow, go through the same situation on the wall, go eat, come back, go to class in the afternoon.

11:27.221 --> 11:33.068
Where did you spend, if you had an off hour, where did you spend that hour?

11:33.568 --> 11:38.073
Normally the MSC, the coffee shop at the MSC.

11:39.034 --> 11:40.356
That was the haven then?

11:40.396 --> 11:41.077
That was the place.

11:41.397 --> 11:42.338
That was the place to go.

11:43.027 --> 11:46.632
You went to the library and went over there to take a nap.

11:49.636 --> 11:52.419
Let's see, describe the library during your time physically.

11:52.499 --> 11:56.445
Was it still just the Cushing?

11:56.765 --> 11:57.105
Yes, sir.

11:58.107 --> 12:02.132
It's nothing like it is now.

12:02.939 --> 12:05.262
I don't know if I can properly describe it.

12:05.722 --> 12:08.245
It had places in there for us to go study.

12:08.305 --> 12:09.967
It had cubicles or whatever you call them.

12:10.989 --> 12:14.132
I spent a lot of time over there.

12:14.152 --> 12:15.234
I thought I was studying.

12:15.274 --> 12:16.255
I'm not sure I really was.

12:16.315 --> 12:17.456
I was probably hiding out.

12:18.878 --> 12:25.766
In the afternoon, if you had some free time mid-afternoon on, what did you do?

12:27.308 --> 12:32.254
As a freshman, if you could get a bag in pass, you'd hit the rack, go sleep.

12:33.027 --> 12:39.856
Otherwise, there wasn't much dead time during the day.

12:39.877 --> 12:45.164
It seemed like there was always, it seemed like I always lucked out and I got a late lab.

12:45.965 --> 12:50.091
And I'd get through, a lab would be a two hour lab, say from three to five.

12:50.912 --> 12:53.475
There wasn't a whole lot of down time.

12:53.556 --> 12:58.983
If there was, if you had a buddy that had a car, we might run off to Brian.

12:59.544 --> 13:02.528
There was always errands to do as far as getting the cleaning done.

13:02.963 --> 13:05.727
you're dry cleaning for your uniforms and all that kind of stuff.

13:05.747 --> 13:09.694
All right, then in the evening, you march to chow again?

13:09.794 --> 13:09.974
Yes, sir.

13:10.816 --> 13:17.026
Then after supper, let's call it, and use that old-fashioned word, after supper, what was the routine?

13:17.046 --> 13:20.111
Well, after supper, you know, you try to hook it on back to the dorm.

13:20.271 --> 13:22.655
And here again, I'm talking, you know, as a freshman.

13:23.356 --> 13:29.646
And, you know, all the upperclassmen, they said they're lined up out there, you know, to do their job.

13:29.896 --> 13:37.329
and get back to the dorm and hopefully you could get right on to your hole.

13:37.449 --> 13:45.764
I mean, you didn't have a room until your juniors called a hole before you encountered the upperclassmen in the hall.

13:47.186 --> 13:48.849
Didn't always happen.

13:48.869 --> 13:52.696
Did your very best to stay out of the band dorm and didn't want to get called the band dorm.

13:52.716 --> 13:53.878
That was a bad place to go.

13:54.213 --> 13:55.955
And we were always pretty lucky.

13:56.015 --> 13:59.600
We lived on either the first stoop or second stoop, so you could probably get in.

13:59.620 --> 14:04.726
The four fish that lived on the fourth stoop, they got caught every outfit on the way up and back.

14:05.587 --> 14:07.389
And then CQ started at 7, 7.30?

14:09.031 --> 14:09.512
7 or 7.30?

14:09.532 --> 14:10.253
7.30.

14:10.313 --> 14:14.078
Yeah, 7.30 to 10.30.

14:15.419 --> 14:16.801
And it was quite an honor.

14:16.821 --> 14:22.448
I mean, you had every opportunity to study if you had to go to the library or whatever.

14:22.934 --> 14:26.017
They left you along there seeking.

14:26.037 --> 14:30.461
Describe the routine for freshmen in the dining hall, in the chow hall.

14:30.801 --> 14:32.163
Well, you ate your square meals.

14:32.223 --> 14:41.331
You sat on the front six inches of your chair, had to have your fish bites.

14:41.611 --> 14:45.095
They sat you in there and staggered you between sophomores and juniors.

14:46.236 --> 14:50.380
The fish at the end of the table on the aisle side, they were the hot corner.

14:50.420 --> 14:51.861
They actually rammed the table.

14:52.313 --> 14:55.157
Everything was family style.

14:55.177 --> 14:58.402
Everything came to us in bowls and serving dishes.

14:59.263 --> 15:06.074
And so, you know, the seniors are serve first, the juniors are sophomores, and then you fish.

15:06.094 --> 15:09.639
We actually had a lot of fun in Duncan.

15:09.659 --> 15:19.333
There was a lot of harassment, but when you're at a table and you've got the mixed classes, the juniors, they've just found newfound freedom.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.515
I mean, they're the white belts.

15:20.798 --> 15:22.861
They're sort of the studs on campus.

15:23.502 --> 15:27.248
And they kind of relax, you know.

15:27.268 --> 15:28.630
They'd have fun with the fish.

15:29.652 --> 15:32.115
Sophomores really couldn't do that.

15:32.135 --> 15:33.237
But we had a lot of fun.

15:33.598 --> 15:35.701
We raised a lot of hell with them.

15:36.382 --> 15:43.132
Describe some of the pranks or jokes or tricks that you know about from the dining hall.

15:43.152 --> 15:44.575
The ones that we could talk about?

15:45.837 --> 15:46.097
Yeah, yeah.

15:47.056 --> 15:56.108
As a freshman, you wore your bib or your napkin in your collar, like a child would, I guess.

15:56.909 --> 16:01.175
Upperclassmen, they always tucked theirs into their belts.

16:01.195 --> 16:14.312
So it was always kind of a neat deal, and they were all paper, to get some freshman to somehow crawl under the table and go down and light this guy's bib.

16:15.018 --> 16:15.959
People weren't hurt.

16:16.140 --> 16:17.682
Nobody was ever hurt to my knowledge.

16:17.722 --> 16:24.031
All the cleaning fluid and stuff in those uniforms, I'm surprised somebody didn't burn it up.

16:24.131 --> 16:26.575
That was always pretty entertaining.

16:26.915 --> 16:34.847
Usually put everybody at the table that clued into it except the guy who was getting burned because you had to have the little boy come through there.

16:36.209 --> 16:39.473
There's always something going on there.

16:40.114 --> 16:42.137
Any other dining hall?

16:43.159 --> 16:44.080
We had a few.

16:44.347 --> 16:47.350
We'd call them deal fights or food fights with rolls.

16:50.213 --> 16:52.956
We had an old boy, it's a flight of the buzzard.

16:52.976 --> 16:58.082
I don't know if you've heard about the buzzard or not, but there was an outfit there, F2, a fox company.

16:58.983 --> 17:05.690
They'd have a fish and he'd go around as a buzzard.

17:05.710 --> 17:11.957
The guy that did it when we were freshmen was a guy named Roger Walk, W-A-A-K, and the guy was just hilarious.

17:12.781 --> 17:16.909
And the point is, you're looking for somebody to puke on them.

17:18.592 --> 17:20.315
This stuff you probably don't want.

17:20.756 --> 17:21.577
No, no, that's good.

17:21.597 --> 17:29.592
So he'd go over there, and of course this upperclassman or whoever was picked out to get this, and then he'd get on out of there.

17:29.757 --> 17:33.463
And the upperclassman was not aware that he had been selected?

17:33.483 --> 17:35.426
No, he wasn't aware he'd been selected.

17:35.526 --> 17:38.631
Everybody knew somebody was selected, but they didn't know who it was.

17:39.472 --> 17:44.880
What about chow hall slang for the various items of food and beverage?

17:45.181 --> 17:49.247
Well, I mentioned a while ago that bread was called deal.

17:49.347 --> 17:51.611
You'd have a deal fight or a bread fight.

17:52.372 --> 17:56.338
The iced tea was...

17:57.280 --> 18:02.868
There was stud, the water was sky, the meat was bull neck.

18:04.731 --> 18:06.213
Of course the potatoes were spuds.

18:08.876 --> 18:10.559
There's some others that are unprintable.

18:10.619 --> 18:11.500
Ketchup?

18:11.520 --> 18:14.965
Ketchup was blood.

18:15.406 --> 18:15.786
Gravy?

18:16.727 --> 18:18.790
Gravy, gravy, gravy.

18:18.810 --> 18:19.431
What was baby?

18:20.553 --> 18:22.235
Baby was mustard.

18:22.255 --> 18:23.277
Mustard, that's right.

18:26.681 --> 18:27.102
Dessert?

18:27.723 --> 18:28.684
Kush.

18:28.704 --> 18:29.685
All desserts were Kush.

18:29.745 --> 18:31.888
All dessert was Kush.

18:31.928 --> 18:32.349
Let's see.

18:32.649 --> 18:35.112
Milk, milk, tea, coffee.

18:35.492 --> 18:36.414
They did have a nickname.

18:36.454 --> 18:37.775
I've never heard of corn for coffee.

18:38.937 --> 18:40.078
Dope.

18:40.098 --> 18:41.199
Coffee was dope.

18:41.219 --> 18:41.560
Dope.

18:41.580 --> 18:42.501
You couldn't say that today.

18:42.541 --> 18:44.884
We didn't know what dope was.

18:45.505 --> 18:47.207
Beans, peas, corn.

18:50.391 --> 18:51.792
Peas were artillery?

18:52.153 --> 18:53.114
I believe you're right.

18:53.234 --> 18:53.795
Is that right?

18:53.855 --> 18:54.676
I believe that's right.

18:54.736 --> 18:55.317
Is that right?

18:55.597 --> 18:56.498
I think that's right.

18:57.507 --> 18:59.590
I don't remember if there was a name for Gravy or not.

18:59.650 --> 19:02.253
I'm sure there was, but I don't remember what it was.

19:02.273 --> 19:10.343
Were you one of those that forgot when you went home with your family and used some dining hall slang?

19:10.603 --> 19:11.444
I tried not to.

19:12.666 --> 19:18.714
I was going to ask you, because I've heard of where that happened, and I thought there has to be a good story occasionally about that.

19:19.394 --> 19:25.422
It was funny, though, you know, sometimes you'd bring somebody home with you, and they...

19:26.161 --> 19:38.374
They might slip every now and then, but I was pretty cautious around my mother and my sisters, and I'd tell my dad some stuff like that, you know, but I didn't talk like that.

19:38.394 --> 19:39.916
Your outfit, did it have a nickname?

19:40.476 --> 19:41.658
It's called A Battery.

19:41.678 --> 19:44.881
But it wasn't like Spider D or anything like that?

19:44.901 --> 19:46.483
No, sure, no.

19:46.523 --> 19:53.991
We lived in the same dorm as Spider D. What made your outfit special to you, as you think back?

19:55.372 --> 19:58.436
I don't know, there's a lot of things.

20:00.398 --> 20:06.766
We were not the most military group on campus.

20:06.786 --> 20:10.290
We had a bunch of good guys and we could get the job done.

20:10.310 --> 20:23.927
We also had a good time and over the years, or over the year we actually got to be, we had some good friends that were sophomores, juniors, seniors, people that you could talk to.

20:25.223 --> 20:30.091
Our fish class, we really bonded.

20:30.792 --> 20:32.234
We got to be close friends.

20:32.334 --> 20:39.746
If you look on, let's see.

20:39.766 --> 20:42.631
Aggie, classmate.

20:44.194 --> 20:45.776
Very lean classmate.

20:45.876 --> 20:47.038
Paul Thompson, classmate.

20:47.078 --> 20:47.659
Very good.

20:50.163 --> 20:51.265
Stan Garner, classmate.

20:51.785 --> 20:54.888
These are all people that I talk to all the time.

20:54.928 --> 21:08.504
I don't know if using the term brothers is right or not, but right now we have a friend in Houston who's very sick and we've all been kind of monitoring that situation.

21:08.524 --> 21:09.745
A good bunch of people.

21:10.406 --> 21:11.627
And we got to know their parents.

21:12.708 --> 21:17.033
In those days the parents didn't come to, at least the ones I was familiar with,

21:17.536 --> 21:22.523
Didn't come up to all the ball games and do all the things that a lot of parents do today.

21:23.504 --> 21:28.531
Probably a lot of it was economics, a lot of it was just hotel space.

21:30.193 --> 21:32.016
People just didn't travel then like they do now.

21:32.316 --> 21:38.725
But we'd go home with our friends on the weekends and you'd get to know their mom and dad and their brothers and their sisters.

21:39.005 --> 21:46.395
In general, what kind of families were they from in terms of economics and what kind of towns?

21:46.578 --> 21:48.500
It varied.

21:49.421 --> 21:57.490
Most of the guys that I ran around with came pretty much from working class families.

21:59.012 --> 22:07.661
The guys from East Texas, their dads normally worked in the refineries, the chemical plants.

22:08.542 --> 22:10.384
In most cases, it was kind of the old school.

22:10.425 --> 22:11.666
The mothers did not work.

22:11.686 --> 22:15.370
They took care of the homes.

22:15.890 --> 22:18.132
And they were first generation college students.

22:18.152 --> 22:20.535
Their parents were not college in most cases.

22:20.575 --> 22:21.115
Most of them.

22:21.375 --> 22:23.758
Most of them were first generation.

22:23.778 --> 22:30.164
We also had some guys who came from some very well-to-do families.

22:30.184 --> 22:35.770
In most of those cases, I look back, most of their dads had gone to AEM.

22:36.511 --> 22:39.694
But they were just pretty much regular guys.

22:40.515 --> 22:45.880
I don't remember anybody flaunting their situation at all.

22:46.012 --> 22:55.223
During your four years, can you describe some good bull events that you knew about any time during your student days?

22:55.663 --> 22:57.686
Good pranks, jokes, tricks?

22:59.108 --> 23:00.369
I've got to think on that.

23:01.751 --> 23:04.754
Let me do some thinking on that.

23:04.814 --> 23:05.775
Let's go ahead then.

23:06.036 --> 23:08.779
How did life change for you as a sophomore?

23:09.552 --> 23:13.477
Well, it was better, but it wasn't as good as we thought it was going to be.

23:15.019 --> 23:15.760
I like that.

23:15.780 --> 23:16.221
That's good.

23:17.262 --> 23:24.071
We were able to get, I guess, a three-by-six rug, and that's what we dressed our room up with.

23:24.091 --> 23:25.733
You still couldn't put anything on the wall.

23:25.793 --> 23:30.539
You had your bulletin board, but you had some authority, a little bit of authority, or thought you did.

23:30.619 --> 23:33.703
You weren't the bottom rung any longer.

23:34.763 --> 23:41.431
In a battery, in my outfit, life as a sophomore was pretty darn good compared to a lot of the other outfits.

23:42.993 --> 23:44.114
And I don't know exactly why.

23:44.354 --> 23:45.996
I think it had to do with our upperclassmen.

23:46.016 --> 23:48.099
We have a pretty good bunch of upperclassmen.

23:48.119 --> 23:51.883
There's a bunch of the upperclassmen I still keep in touch with.

23:51.963 --> 23:58.291
Now, symbolically, emotionally, when did you become a sophomore?

23:59.352 --> 24:01.635
When did you realize, I'm no longer a fish?

24:02.576 --> 24:03.657
I guess at...

24:04.379 --> 24:07.666
at Final Review, I would say.

24:07.706 --> 24:16.223
It takes a while for it to soak in, but you know, once Final Review was over, we came back around with our black braid on, you know.

24:18.047 --> 24:21.955
See, in those days, at the Final Review, you still had finals.

24:22.055 --> 24:26.083
So, Final Review was on a Saturday, and then the finals were the following week.

24:26.401 --> 24:28.624
Went back to the dorm and everybody's pretty equal.

24:28.824 --> 24:31.067
Everybody's calling you by first name and this, that, and that.

24:31.087 --> 24:33.430
Of course, we were all cramming because we had great problems.

24:34.071 --> 24:37.194
And we had to make some good final scores.

24:37.555 --> 24:43.783
Do you remember anybody saying anything or doing anything that made you feel you now were accepted?

24:44.063 --> 24:46.366
No, I can't say that I did.

24:46.466 --> 24:50.831
All right, let's see.

24:51.152 --> 24:56.138
Memorable teachers, advisors, counselors during your four years?

24:57.113 --> 24:58.435
Who were the special people?

25:01.298 --> 25:02.881
You better let me think on that one, too.

25:02.901 --> 25:06.585
Because there have to be some people that were special.

25:06.605 --> 25:20.504
The instructors or professors that I enjoyed the most were our B Law, Business Law teachers.

25:20.524 --> 25:24.589
There was Judge Stewart.

25:25.058 --> 25:29.082
Real red faced old boy, country attorney type fella.

25:30.144 --> 25:36.310
And Jim Dozier, James Dozier.

25:36.330 --> 25:42.357
Mr. Dozier had a few fingers missing on one hand and to make his points he'd always raise his hand up.

25:42.777 --> 25:43.739
Did he have a nickname?

25:44.399 --> 25:45.180
I've never heard of him.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.001
Not that I recall.

25:46.181 --> 25:47.322
Like Judge Stewart did.

25:47.443 --> 25:48.744
Not that I recall.

25:48.924 --> 25:50.526
Just known as Mr. Dozier.

25:51.805 --> 25:57.130
Looking back, I think he was also pretty involved in the Bryan College Station community.

25:57.151 --> 25:58.732
I think he was a council member.

25:59.793 --> 26:06.440
But those attorneys, they're so articulate, and Stewart was especially colorful.

26:07.441 --> 26:18.032
Judge Stewart would have his wife come in when we had exams, and I don't know if she was- it was a big class, because a lot of people wanted to get in that class.

26:19.261 --> 26:25.829
You know, if you had a question or something, call her over and ask her this question.

26:25.849 --> 26:27.811
She was about as racy as he was.

26:28.872 --> 26:31.776
What about English, math?

26:31.796 --> 26:32.256
Remember any?

26:32.497 --> 26:34.539
Well, you've got to realize this.

26:34.619 --> 26:37.743
I wasn't the world's best student.

26:39.205 --> 26:46.433
And I had a history prof, Dr. Huntberger, and she's still there.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.788
I always enjoyed her class.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.911
She was very, very good.

26:51.931 --> 26:55.575
I was in her class when I needed to make some great points.

26:55.635 --> 27:03.523
And I've always been, I wouldn't say a fan, but I've always been interested in history, and this was American history.

27:03.543 --> 27:07.206
And I enjoyed her class a lot.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.207
English, math?

27:08.227 --> 27:11.731
I don't remember the professors.

27:11.751 --> 27:13.393
Science?

27:13.453 --> 27:14.354
What about in the Corps?

27:14.374 --> 27:16.656
Were there some special advisors, counselors?

27:22.036 --> 27:24.919
Not that I was involved.

27:24.939 --> 27:25.259
MSC?

27:26.120 --> 27:26.780
I wasn't involved.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.042
Most everything I did was a core in Aggieland.

27:29.062 --> 27:30.103
Alright, what about Aggieland?

27:30.143 --> 27:36.089
Was there any... A fellow that we worked with over there, and he is still there, Lane Stevenson.

27:36.109 --> 27:44.617
He was a director of student publications, but I don't remember exactly what his title was.

27:44.897 --> 27:45.978
What was he like to work with?

27:46.278 --> 27:46.919
He was great.

27:46.939 --> 27:50.322
You know, he was a Marine.

27:52.040 --> 27:58.577
And he helped us a lot and there was a lady there in the Aggieland office, her name was Prehoda.

27:59.660 --> 28:00.743
Mrs. Prehoda, Barbara?

28:01.304 --> 28:02.006
I think that's right.

28:02.026 --> 28:04.553
Yeah, she was real sweet.

28:04.573 --> 28:06.538
She helped us a lot.

28:06.687 --> 28:08.690
All right, let's see.

28:09.331 --> 28:10.292
Let's go back to class.

28:11.093 --> 28:19.685
Describe what you, as you look back on it, what was the expected decorum for you as a student in class?

28:20.065 --> 28:22.088
How did you all behave in class?

28:23.830 --> 28:28.016
Well, it was much different than high school.

28:29.398 --> 28:35.226
As far as behavior, everybody was a gentleman.

28:35.864 --> 28:47.521
I don't remember any cutting up, and I don't remember any disrespect to the teachers, professors, instructors at all.

28:49.885 --> 28:56.335
One thing that you could do in college, that you could do in high school, if you thought you had this lecture down, you'd close your book and leave.

28:57.556 --> 28:58.858
And some people did.

29:00.821 --> 29:02.023
In those days,

29:03.134 --> 29:07.999
smoke during a quiz, or during a test.

29:09.180 --> 29:14.985
And that always impressed me, so I started smoking.

29:15.005 --> 29:16.787
And I didn't do that very long.

29:18.128 --> 29:21.952
Do you remember any pranks during class?

29:22.712 --> 29:23.713
I'd be surprised if you did.

29:23.753 --> 29:24.454
Not during class.

29:25.375 --> 29:26.016
I don't know of any.

29:26.116 --> 29:32.922
No, it seemed, you know, some of the goofy things that would happen and they weren't pranks and they weren't intentional, like you'd have a chemistry lab.

29:33.323 --> 29:37.249
and whatever you're working on would turn your brass black or something.

29:37.270 --> 29:40.875
And you usually got a nail going back to the quad because of that.

29:41.316 --> 29:45.784
But I don't remember to remember anything.

29:45.804 --> 29:47.947
Everybody pretty much behaved themselves.

29:48.067 --> 29:52.374
When you needed to talk to a faculty member outside of class, were they available?

29:52.394 --> 29:53.316
Very available.

29:53.336 --> 29:53.596
Yes, sir.

29:53.677 --> 29:53.977
Always.

29:54.638 --> 29:56.040
It was your initiative, you know.

29:56.862 --> 29:58.825
But they were always available, always very helpful.

29:59.918 --> 30:08.889
I do remember early on, it's my first semester fish year and my English teacher, and I do not remember her name, but she's a very nice lady.

30:09.530 --> 30:11.572
I was a pretty good English student in high school.

30:11.593 --> 30:15.217
I never could diagram a sentence or do all that stuff, but I could write.

30:15.337 --> 30:17.720
I could write a 500-word essay or any of that.

30:18.721 --> 30:22.826
So I did one, and I made a C on the Derm thing, and I didn't understand.

30:22.887 --> 30:25.690
I thought I had at least a B or maybe an A. I thought it was a good one.

30:26.243 --> 30:30.768
Went over and visited with her, and she was the first one I ever talked to, and I guess that's why I remember the meeting.

30:31.149 --> 30:36.295
We went through a lot of things, and she said, you know, I said, well, you know, it's a big step in college, high school.

30:36.315 --> 30:37.536
She said, yes, it is, but she'll be fine.

30:40.420 --> 30:45.185
But as far as, if you needed help and needed to talk to somebody, they were very valuable.

30:46.687 --> 30:52.214
During your four years, did you ever have any financial problems that you needed somebody to help with?

30:52.234 --> 30:55.137
I was fortunate, very fortunate.

30:55.505 --> 31:01.150
My uncle paid for all of my education.

31:01.170 --> 31:03.893
Also, he'd give me a small allowance.

31:04.654 --> 31:05.975
And I had jobs on campus.

31:07.016 --> 31:10.599
Describe those, what they were and how much they paid and so forth.

31:10.779 --> 31:21.890
As the Aggieland assistant editor and the Aggieland editor, if I remember right, it was something like $40 or $50 a month.

31:21.910 --> 31:25.393
We put a lot of time in over there, but that was pretty good spending money.
