If students didn't feel themselves directly 
threatened by a governmental activity or policy,

00:02.326 --> 00:11.858
they were less likely to be involved in it. It makes 
one wonder whether if they hadn't been drafting

00:11.978 --> 00:24.154
18-year-old males or 19-year-old males during 
the Vietnam War, if we'd have even been able to get

00:11.978 --> 00:24.154
that much activity out of students. In other 
words, I guess my point is, on the one hand, I think I

00:25.336 --> 00:30.983
was disappointed with the way students had 
changed. On the other hand, maybe they hadn't

00:31.199 --> 00:33.342
changed. Maybe the only difference was that, you 
know, people weren't being drafted anymore. And

00:39.610 --> 00:45.137
so there wasn't any, nothing was going to happen to 
them. And they were just much more apathetic. In

00:48.541 --> 00:59.335
fact, the only issue that seemed to upset students 
was the issue of beer drinking on campus or the age

00:48.541 --> 00:59.335
at which you could drink alcohol. And that seemed 
to draw out a lot of people. And it was fairly

01:02.367 --> 01:12.464
frustrating because we tried to get a student 
elected to the city council and almost succeeded,

01:02.367 --> 01:12.464
got them into a run-on. That was back when I came 
back in 1973 to San Marcos. Our history class was

01:18.915 --> 01:24.865
discussing the 50s was back to normalcy and then 
the 60s was this anti-war movement type era. And we

01:29.904 --> 01:39.734
were discussing how the late 70s and early 80s, you 
could describe our era if you were writing 15 years

01:29.904 --> 01:39.734
from now, that they all laid back and took a nap. How 
do you feel about that? Do you see that in the

01:42.177 --> 01:45.460
students and younger generation today? Well, I 
see a lot of, it doesn't seem to be the same degree of

01:45.981 --> 01:52.928
activism or concern about what's going on around 
them. and I don't know if that's because things are

01:53.667 --> 02:03.997
basically fairly peaceful or in the sense there's 
not anything that's really threatening to the

01:53.667 --> 02:03.997
students or college-age students. I know myself, 
my father was in the Air Force and my uncle was in the

02:04.978 --> 02:21.254
Navy and I have never heard anything while they 
were in the service, neither one of them went to

02:04.978 --> 02:21.254
Vietnam, but I've never heard anything about the 
service or when they were growing up how they felt

02:04.978 --> 02:21.254
at this time. Do you think that A lot of people have 
become a little hush-hush about the 60s, and

02:23.080 --> 02:33.630
that's why we don't have some of the feelings that 
we could have if they had discussed that with us

02:23.080 --> 02:33.630
more. I think a lot of people choose not to discuss 
it. Some of it's because they realize that the

02:36.793 --> 02:47.964
Vietnam policies that a lot of them supported were 
really just not correct, and that a lot of people

02:36.793 --> 02:47.964
realize that we should never have been there. And 
it seemed like as time went on, more and more people

02:48.084 --> 02:51.687
agreed that you know, Vietnam was just a disaster 
and we should have never been there in the first

02:52.156 --> 02:56.324
place. And I think that's part of it that you don't 
hear very much about it because most people don't

02:56.805 --> 03:08.146
like to either say, you know, we were wrong or we 
should have done something more to get our

02:56.805 --> 03:08.146
government out of there. Also, I think people just 
would like to forget that that ever happened. And

03:14.431 --> 03:18.537
it's just not discussed as much anymore. It's just 
looked upon as a bad part of the history, and

03:18.557 --> 03:23.965
hopefully it won't ever happen again. Oh, boy. 
Well, that's all I have to ask of you. I really

03:29.894 --> 03:31.476
appreciate your time. I know you probably have a 
very busy schedule. That's right. So, thank you.

03:36.203 --> 03:36.844
Okay.
