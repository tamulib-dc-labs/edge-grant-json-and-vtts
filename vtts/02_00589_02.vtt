00:02.596 --> 00:08.004
If it's five minutes or ten minutes, it doesn't 
matter. Okay, I think now we're up to question

00:08.024 --> 00:10.427
four. Question four. What do you feel is the best 
solution to the war?

00:19.339 --> 00:19.880
Or to peace. No, I think you've put it precisely, 
and I like that. The best solution to the war...

00:33.528 --> 01:01.189
it involves the four parties to the war and four 
armies involved in the war now agreeing for the

00:33.528 --> 01:01.189
normal political reasons on a ceasefire and some 
form of power sharing wars always end in one of two

00:33.528 --> 01:01.189
ways either one side wins and defeats the other and 
that ends the war or you have some form of stalemate

01:01.827 --> 01:25.219
and the war reaches the point where all sides or 
most of the parties to realize there must be some

01:01.827 --> 01:25.219
form of negotiated settlement and compromise and 
I think without a doubt the war in Cambodia is one of

01:26.060 --> 01:56.067
those wars that nobody's ever going to win 
militarily in any decisive way and it's also a war

01:26.060 --> 01:56.067
which can go on at its present level low intensity 
level that

01:26.060 --> 01:56.067
heavily ideologically laden expression it could 
go on for a long time And it's not a question of the

01:56.047 --> 02:04.460
war being fueled by external supplies of arms 
entirely. The war will go on for a long time because

02:04.621 --> 02:11.231
there's some serious political disputes amongst 
these parties. And they will find weapons locally

02:12.273 --> 02:21.447
if, in fact, supplies are cut off from one external 
source, no doubt about it. Okay, so there has to be

02:22.490 --> 02:28.702
some form of negotiated solution to the war.

02:31.788 --> 02:36.938
At present, this has proved impossible. Because, 
in spite of what they say, the Phnom Penh people,

02:37.728 --> 02:52.729
the Ho Ninh Tsen government and the Hang Sơn Minh 
party, backed by Vietnam, really don't want

02:37.728 --> 02:52.729
negotiations. They still want a solution which 
leaves the legitimate People's Party and the

02:53.450 --> 03:06.368
biggest revolutionary government in power And 
what they are trying to do is to bring

03:07.225 --> 03:27.698
international opinion, public opinion, the 
media, aid agencies, and Western liberal

03:07.225 --> 03:27.698
governments around to their point of view by 
campaigning against the Khmer Rouge. by

03:28.285 --> 03:45.467
discrediting the other side by laying claims 
which are cogent and credible within the

03:28.285 --> 03:45.467
framework of our liberal tradition which will 
allow them to have the government which they see to

03:28.285 --> 03:45.467
be necessary within their strategic framework 
and also just within their communist

03:46.477 --> 04:04.030
revolutionary proletarian international way of 
looking at things so they're playing tough

03:46.477 --> 04:04.030
they're playing a very hard game They're asking 
for everything. They're trying to win the war

04:07.434 --> 04:32.464
politically by means of this

04:07.434 --> 04:32.464
worldwide mobilization of public opinion, 
trying to win the war with propaganda that they

04:07.434 --> 04:32.464
have, in some sense, failed to win with the 
invasion force and the occupation force. So the

04:32.714 --> 04:48.014
idea is to isolate the Khmer Rouge, to isolate 
Siena, to isolate the KPMG, the middle class

04:32.714 --> 04:48.014
nationalists by political means rather than 
military means. That's their strategy. And the

04:49.355 --> 04:52.900
Paris conference failed last August. or I should 
say it didn't progress very far because the

04:53.808 --> 05:04.527
Vietnamese and the Phnom Penh people were not 
prepared to negotiate very much at all. Of course

05:05.198 --> 05:14.969
they said they're prepared to talk about this and 
that, they're prepared to have international

05:05.198 --> 05:14.969
observer forces look at this and look at that, and 
verify this and verify that. But they always

05:15.970 --> 05:34.530
wanted these mechanisms set up, or these observer 
forces reporting to themselves, not to the UN, and

05:15.970 --> 05:34.530
thereby recognizing what they call the de facto 
political reality. so they're using the iron fist

05:34.510 --> 06:04.483
if you like to continue to demand everything and in 
a subtle way also to blackmail us in the West by

05:34.510 --> 06:04.483
using the very serious plight of the people the 
horrific social conditions the appalling

05:34.510 --> 06:04.483
shocking economic realities in the country to 
encourage us to say, as is said by the Oxfam people

06:14.318 --> 06:36.900
who are in John Pilger's film to kind of give up on 
the political front and say oh all right you know

06:14.318 --> 06:36.900
we'll just feed the people we'll just recognize 
you give you development you know pretend it

06:14.318 --> 06:36.900
didn't happen pretend there never was any 
patience

06:14.318 --> 06:36.900
it is blackmail let me let me stress that the they 
criticize the Thai government and the United

06:36.880 --> 07:06.398
Nations for using refugee camps to carry on with 
the war and they say the refugees in those camps are

06:36.880 --> 07:06.398
political pawns well, they do the same thing 
they're using the people inside the country and

06:36.880 --> 07:06.398
the needs of those people inside the country as 
political pawns and shoving these pawns on our TV

06:36.880 --> 07:06.398
screens all the time and trying to persuade us to 
come around to their political position So the

07:07.863 --> 07:25.467
best solution clearly is some form of compromise, 
some form of power sharing, some form of

07:07.863 --> 07:25.467
internationally controlled ceasefire and 
armistice followed by the demobilization of

07:07.863 --> 07:25.467
substantial numbers of troops from all four 
armies I mean all four not simply the Khmer Rouge

07:25.801 --> 07:38.055
people talk about the Khmer Rouge all the time but 
there are four armies here and the second

07:25.801 --> 07:38.055
largest

07:38.930 --> 08:02.440
force to be demobilized the central army the Phnom 
Penh regime and it's very important that they be

07:38.930 --> 08:02.440
disarmed and demobilized because the Soviets 
have given them extraordinary quantities of arms

07:38.930 --> 08:02.440
and from what I can see from what my friends in Phnom 
Penh tell me that army is not a very disciplined

07:38.930 --> 08:02.440
army and when they go into battle they take these 
soviet weapons and they're huge stocks of bullets

08:02.420 --> 08:24.023
and artillery shells and they just you know 
blanket artillery carpet carpet artillery

08:02.420 --> 08:24.023
shelling which is very destructive any 
international force that goes into Cambodia has

08:24.323 --> 08:36.865
to grab those arms depots and arms caches 
everywhere a lot of weaponry in this country now

08:24.323 --> 08:36.865
that armistice and internationally supervised 
ceasefire and relocation of the troops must take

08:37.503 --> 09:03.308
place alongside political arrangements for the 
reorganization of the government of Phnom Penh

08:37.503 --> 09:03.308
and the central administration of Phnom Penh. 
political arrangements for elections and this

09:03.777 --> 09:24.064
will likely involve so many sort of census of a 
population and the establishment of an electoral

09:03.777 --> 09:24.064
register, we would call it in Britain. People have 
to register to vote and there have to be ways to be

09:24.044 --> 09:40.855
found to ensure that everybody who is eligible is 
in fact allowed to vote and that there's no

09:24.044 --> 09:40.855
cheating, that some villages don't. have 
electoral registers which gave each citizen 10

09:40.835 --> 10:05.796
votes like the payrolls of the Mondo army exactly 
and and if this isn't carefully controlled

09:40.835 --> 10:05.796
everyone will be doing that everyone will have 
stress and everyone will say the Khmer Rouge are

09:40.835 --> 10:05.796
cheating but every Cambodian will cheat a lot of a 
lot of the nasty things that are said about the

09:40.835 --> 10:05.796
Khmer Rouge are really indicative of common 
practices amongst Cambodians. But there's never

10:12.020 --> 10:14.823
been very clean elections in Cambodia. It's the 
same in most very well-known countries. So

10:18.106 --> 10:20.408
arranging an election will be time consuming. It 
will probably take governments a year to arrange

10:20.428 --> 10:23.831
the election. But it shouldn't take more than two 
years. And that's important. Things should move

10:29.796 --> 10:41.267
right along once there is a basic agreement on an 
interim political authority, international

10:29.796 --> 10:41.267
control and supervision, a ceasefire, 
demobilization,

10:41.247 --> 11:04.832
reorganization of administration, basically to 
incorporate people from the other three parties

10:41.247 --> 11:04.832
and also to begin the process of receiving close to 
700,000 Cambodians who are overseas. Let me

11:05.673 --> 11:07.655
stress that number. Regime Phnom Penh keeps 
saying, They have to keep their full

11:10.778 --> 11:22.965
administration because there are no more skilled 
people left to govern the country, and they

11:10.778 --> 11:22.965
retrain a lot of people. well it is true that a 
certain number of educated people were killed

11:24.042 --> 11:50.151
under Pol Pot but basically again this argument is 
propaganda and a pretext too for continuing to

11:24.042 --> 11:50.151
lock out if you like all of that talent which is in 
the US and France and Belgium especially in France

11:24.042 --> 11:50.151
of course with

11:50.435 --> 11:58.170
a couple hundred thousand Cambodians anxious to 
go back home. And they were the best educated

11:58.190 --> 12:06.426
people to begin with, and now their children have 
grown up and have been well educated. So there are a

12:06.446 --> 12:11.937
lot of skilled Cambodians in the world who could 
contribute to the to the peace process and to the

12:11.917 --> 12:31.022
reconstruction of their country and these people 
simply must be allowed to come back and they cannot

12:11.917 --> 12:31.022
come back unless there's a negotiation 
politically they're denounced as dangerous

12:11.917 --> 12:31.022
elements and all sorts of excuses are used to keep 
them out unless of course now they want to do

12:32.082 --> 12:49.669
business with Phnom Penh because going through 
one of those periods of liberal reform in Phnom

12:32.082 --> 12:49.669
Penh which is designed to make the party more 
popular than it really is or make it appear to be

12:32.082 --> 12:49.669
more popular than it than it has been. So this 
problem of the repatriation of refugees in the

12:53.133 --> 13:10.375
border camps and the repatriation of people who 
settled abroad is crucial to a successful

12:53.133 --> 13:10.375
settlement, to a settlement that will last, to a 
settlement that will lead to post-war

13:11.249 --> 13:40.395
reconstruction trying to repair the roads 
rapidly and get things back in order as well as

13:11.249 --> 13:40.395
post-war development there has to be two steps 
here and the country needs every engineer every

13:11.249 --> 13:40.395
accountant every planner every land development 
expert every urban development expert that's

13:11.249 --> 13:40.395
ever trained in that field to make and make the best 
use of the international aid and reconstruction

13:40.375 --> 14:09.876
and development money which will be forthcoming 
if there is a settlement within the framework of

13:40.375 --> 14:09.876
the Paris Conference so in a couple of sentences 
the best solution to the war is a solution which is

13:40.375 --> 14:09.876
worked out within the framework of the Paris 
Conference which involves in the normal way UN

13:40.375 --> 14:09.876
control and supervision And the worst solution is 
the solution that the Vietnamese and Hong San

14:10.919 --> 14:23.275
people kept trying to promote at Paris. August and 
keep trying to sell if you like to their solution

14:23.710 --> 14:46.191
which they call a partial solution or sometimes 
they call it an external solution involves simply

14:23.710 --> 14:46.191
a symbolic coalition between the Phnom Penh the 
Cambodian People's Revolutionary Party and CNU,

14:46.171 --> 14:57.332
or maybe CNU and the KPMG, excluding the Khmer 
Rouge. This solution is no solution at all. they

15:00.734 --> 15:27.265
say it will isolate the Khmer Rouge and the Khmer 
Rouge will be finished but that's untrue that's

15:00.734 --> 15:27.265
untrue because the Khmer Rouge represent a 
certain nationalist force and the Khmer Rouge

15:00.734 --> 15:27.265
have a certain level of support which 
incidentally will remain loyal as long as the

15:00.734 --> 15:27.265
Vietnamese are seen to be controlling things in 
Phnom Penh because that is the essence of it Khmer

15:27.245 --> 15:44.562
Rouge nationalism they are opposed to Vietnamese 
colonialism in Cambodia Khmer Rouge nationalism

15:27.245 --> 15:44.562
defends Khmer independence, Cambodian 
independence and they can always rally people on

15:27.245 --> 15:44.562
that basis privately at Paris and earlier in 
Jakarta Hun Sen kept assuring Siena well if you

15:46.111 --> 16:05.841
come over to us if you join us there will be just a 
little war and we could live with it we keep them out

15:46.111 --> 16:05.841
of pain and things will be all right But this is 
utopian. This is a trick. I don't think Hun Sen got

16:12.710 --> 16:14.914
stupid. But in Hun Sen's point of view, his current 
position now is preferable to what his position

16:14.934 --> 16:26.715
would be in a real coalition. he prefers a symbolic 
coalition with Siena because that would

16:27.539 --> 16:45.733
strengthen his position from what it is now but it 
certainly wouldn't end the war it wouldn't bring

16:27.539 --> 16:45.733
peace now let me end by saying the way you 
formulated the question The beginning is more

16:46.979 --> 16:49.502
precise.

16:52.225 --> 16:58.493
The best solution, or the best course towards 
peace, in my view, begins with ending the war. Now,

16:59.915 --> 17:12.750
the human rights activists in Oxfam and some of the 
American groups, David Hawkes can go to the

16:59.915 --> 17:12.750
Documentation Commission for America, they 
would say the way to peace is to deal with the Khmer

17:12.848 --> 17:41.100
Rouge to maybe punish them, put them on trial, 
eliminate them, discredit them, you know outlaw

17:12.848 --> 17:41.100
them, Aksan people now talking about outlawing 
the Khmer Rouge quite how one does it, I don't know,

17:12.848 --> 17:41.100
but anyway that's what they say and in their view 
this is the way to peace but it's a sort of moral,

17:12.848 --> 17:41.100
elusive, imagined peace The best solution is, 
first of all, to find ways to end the war and then you

17:42.211 --> 18:11.037
engage in political compromise as you take into 
account who has power, who has administrative

17:42.211 --> 18:11.037
power, who has royal power, who has military power 
and you put together a coalition which will allow

17:42.211 --> 18:11.037
the country to have a government which is 
different from the one that we've had before which

17:42.211 --> 18:11.037
is not dominated by the Canary, not dominated by 
the Siam, not dominated by the Huns and the people

18:11.253 --> 18:38.425
and which is internationally supervised and 
where people have in some sense to use an American

18:11.253 --> 18:38.425
expression their heads knocked together by 
international bodies now and again because there

18:11.253 --> 18:38.425
will be conflict, there will be assassinations, 
there will be trouble but it will be much less

18:11.253 --> 18:38.425
trouble and much less dangerous for most people 
than the situation that exists now which is very

18:11.253 --> 18:38.425
dangerous
