WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:11.668
to be in Austin chatting with Speaker Bill Clayton 
about his reminiscences and recollections of

00:02.360 --> 00:11.668
being a student at Texas A&M.

00:17.433 --> 00:22.117
As we began, first question, why did you go to A&M? 
Well,

00:24.439 --> 00:31.185
I have a good friend at Spring Lake, Texas, I was 
drafted. Right immediately after building the

00:35.427 --> 00:42.294
camp, I was sent overseas and was shot for the first 
big Israel kill. And I wanted to do something about

00:42.314 --> 00:44.696
it. And I was too young to be... I went to volunteer. 
I was 17 years old. And they wouldn't let me in. I

00:54.366 --> 00:55.187
believe I was 17. I might have been 16. And so then I 
looked around. to see how else I might be able to

01:01.355 --> 01:06.923
accomplish that. And wanting to get into college, 
I knew that I had to have some more credits for

01:06.943 --> 01:15.736
wanting my little high school offer. It was a 
period of war when there wasn't any good teachers

01:15.756 --> 01:23.187
left, men teachers. A lot of the subject matters, 
science and mathematics, advanced math, was just

01:23.768 --> 01:30.838
not there. I enrolled in Texas Tech, or was trying 
to enroll in Texas Tech. I was married about a week

01:38.766 --> 01:44.754
before they told me I just wasn't qualified to have 
any of these other subjects. So I decided then to

01:44.914 --> 01:55.610
find me a place where I could go and pick up those 
last senior subjects that I needed, and it was

01:44.914 --> 01:55.610
Allen Academy in Bryan, Texas. Well, I got quite an 
attachment to A&M while I was at Allen Academy.

02:01.025 --> 02:02.106
Now, what year was that? This was in 1946.

02:06.030 --> 02:09.394
So it was just natural that I moved from there to 
A&M. And certainly I've never regretted it. So you

02:13.999 --> 02:16.722
enrolled as a freshman in the fall of? No, 1946. 
1946. And you were at Allen in 45, 46? Right. High

02:23.309 --> 02:28.595
school was Spring Lake?

02:28.635 --> 02:28.855
Uh-huh. came to enroll as a freshman in the fall of 
46. How did you get there? Describe that trip.

02:36.198 --> 02:45.549
Well, I believe on that first occasion my parents 
brought me back. But it was a long way to West Texas.

02:48.853 --> 02:54.960
And, you know, of course in them days it was all 
Corps, all military.

02:55.548 --> 03:08.120
Once you didn't get a chance to go home except just 
one or two times during the semester, I believe

02:55.548 --> 03:08.120
Easter maybe, and then in the fall you got to go to 
Thanksgiving and Christmas, and that was about

02:55.548 --> 03:08.120
it. And our mode of transportation in them days was 
hitchhiking. Describe Aggie hitchhiking. Well,

03:14.806 --> 03:21.833
we had old Highway 6, which is right out in front of 
the campus, in front of the demonstration

03:14.806 --> 03:21.833
building. Aggies would line up there. and they 
would take their turn, one behind the other as they

03:23.813 --> 03:30.684
had lined up, and thumbing a ride. And you know, 
with the uniforms on in that day and time, and the

03:31.986 --> 03:44.927
war just about to come to a close, everybody 
stopped for a uniform to pick them up and carry them

03:31.986 --> 03:44.927
where they were going. And so I remember standing 
in that line several times. Do you remember any

03:51.117 --> 03:54.182
Important stories about hitchhiking, good or 
bad? Interesting experiences? Yes, I do.

04:02.675 --> 04:12.490
One summer school, on the 4th of July, my roommate 
and I decided to see how far we could hitchhike on

04:02.675 --> 04:12.490
the weekend and get back to classes. We took off and 
we got to Chicago. And it was an interesting deal.

04:24.024 --> 04:28.229
In Texarkana, we caught a truck going to St. Louis. 
It was raining. I mean, we were out there just

04:30.712 --> 04:34.116
getting drenched. And this truck stopped and 
picked us up. St. Louis on the edge of Chicago. I

04:41.965 --> 04:45.549
forgot now who we caught, but it was one ride. And of 
course, the interesting thing was, when we stayed

04:50.770 --> 04:56.676
one night there in Chicago.

04:58.398 --> 05:05.245
And on the way back, we caught a guy with, at that 
time, the latest model Buick. You know, they kind

05:05.285 --> 05:09.549
of would make cars for a while there. And this guy 
was, he was an amazing guy. He was talking about

05:17.257 --> 05:18.718
owning an aircraft. We didn't know where it was 
blowing or, you know, whether it was a real thing or

05:22.746 --> 05:27.031
what. And, of course, the amazing thing was, too, 
that as we just began to realize as we were driving

05:28.433 --> 05:35.841
along, he was about half drunk. And reaching on the 
cedar once in a while to fill out the bottle and, you

05:36.642 --> 05:43.150
know, it kind of put the fear in you a little bit. He 
had passed the bottle around and we'd partake

05:45.693 --> 05:49.077
because we'd We're so dang scared we didn't know 
what not to do. But he kept telling us a story about

05:52.433 --> 06:02.083
he had a mansion in St. Louis with 25 rooms and all 
kinds of things like that. Well, lo and behold, he

06:03.604 --> 06:07.208
took us and showed us one in St. Louis. So he was 
real. And so we spent a major portion of the night in

06:09.230 --> 06:14.175
St. Louis. Did he identify his profession? You 
know, he may have, I have forgotten. Anyway,

06:19.193 --> 06:33.551
we got back on the road, got back to College Station 
Monday morning, and missed an 8 o'clock class and

06:19.193 --> 06:33.551
made it 9 o'clock. And that was quite a... Y'all 
left? We left on, I believe it was Friday about

06:36.916 --> 06:43.424
noon. Do you remember any negative hitchhiking? 
From what experience?

06:50.245 --> 06:57.114
And I attacked a lot, but there's only one 
experience that I remember was negative. And the

06:57.134 --> 07:16.658
guy that lived in Olsen, Texas, which is about six 
miles from Spring Lake, in fact, I believe it was at

06:57.134 --> 07:16.658
that time,

06:57.134 --> 07:16.658
and we were hitching back home, and we got a ride 
somewhere

07:18.072 --> 07:41.532
right like where it was

07:18.072 --> 07:41.532
it was probably uh

07:18.072 --> 07:41.532
before you it was before we got that

07:18.072 --> 07:41.532
and it was a sharp ride and we got him and this guy got 
talking about his experience the night before

07:18.072 --> 07:41.532
with a young boy and he just kept on and said you know 
what he just went into details and we made him pull

07:43.891 --> 08:11.198
over and stop and we got out but that's the only 
experience i ever had that even could have turned

07:43.891 --> 08:11.198
to that all right now hitchhiking from con station 
to spring lake what was the normal route uh routes

07:43.891 --> 08:11.198
uh well we went on highway six uh that time c6 before 
uh highway uh interstate 20 Highway 6 now cuts off,

08:12.140 --> 08:16.025
I think, at Cisco or Eastland or somewhere there. 
But at that time, it went on through Abilene. And

08:19.870 --> 08:26.679
then from Abilene, I think we took 84.

08:27.380 --> 08:29.202
Describe the campus physically. What buildings 
were where when you were a freshman? Very little on

08:33.788 --> 08:37.733
the west campus, the dairy. As far as classrooms on 
the west campus, there wasn't any. There

08:42.481 --> 08:53.839
was a lot of buildings there then that are not there 
now, like Hyatt Hall and Walden and some of those.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.589
There was about 6,000 of us in the Corps. We were in 
the new area, we called it at that time, which

09:01.672 --> 09:08.623
really wasn't too old. And you know, it was an 
experience that I don't think anybody can forget,

09:11.253 --> 09:24.690
because our freshman class was probably the worst 
hazed class that came down the pike in a long time.

09:24.710 --> 09:30.678
And this was just before it closed down. They left 
right on the air base. They and Emma took it over.

09:34.763 --> 09:39.910
Some of us were out there for classes. And then some 
were on campus. But man, the hazing was something

09:43.695 --> 09:47.681
just unbelievable. Describe that. Well, it would 
be nothing at all to be walking to the classroom and

09:49.063 --> 10:02.823
just buckled down because your knees get out 
because the morning before or the night before you

09:49.063 --> 10:02.823
had to do sternum and knee bends. Or to stand on your 
tiptoes and grab butterflies with razor blades

10:02.923 --> 10:07.850
under your heels. I mean, that kind of stuff. And 
the paddle was a well-known weapon for the upper

10:10.973 --> 10:16.542
draftsmen at that time. If a paddle was used, when 
and how many licks? Usually it was, I'm trying to

10:22.351 --> 10:31.666
think, it seemed like it was three after a warm-up. 
But I have gone to the shower, and I've gone to the

10:31.686 --> 10:37.555
shower many times to soak my shorts on because I've 
got a mistake. Now, normally when you were

10:37.720 --> 10:42.767
paddled, you had on your trousers or just your 
shorts? Usually just my shorts. And did you have to

10:45.331 --> 10:48.436
do anything bad to get that paddling? You know, I 
don't remember, but I can't recall what we would

10:49.918 --> 11:00.834
think was bad to get it. You were living on the 
campus or at Bryan Field? I lived on the Bryan

11:03.858 --> 11:04.960
Field. Okay. Describe that. Because that's kind 
of special. Well, at that time, as the Air Force

11:09.687 --> 11:31.426
moved out, and then just moved in, and we were in the 
same dormitories, you know, with 15, 20, I guess

11:09.687 --> 11:31.426
12, 15 rows of beds on each side, and the head down at 
the end of one of the barracks. And about how many

11:31.446 --> 11:35.209
fish were out there? I think the whole freshman 
class was out there. Any sophomores? Yeah, we had

11:39.263 --> 11:40.825
our classmen out there. That's where we got our 
A's. Okay. We had just the regular officers that,

11:43.067 --> 11:51.917
you know, you have in a company or a battalion, 
sophomores, juniors, and seniors. And you were

11:53.059 --> 11:54.761
out there the whole year? Yeah. The whole academic 
year. How often did y'all come into the campus? We

12:00.507 --> 12:03.010
came in quite a few times for A lot of military 
drills and things like that. Football games?

12:06.794 --> 12:07.174
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Y'all practice? Yes.

12:11.739 --> 12:13.721
And did the faculty live out there? I don't know. 
But you had all your classes out there. Yes.

12:22.651 --> 12:23.131
Let's see. You didn't have a fish old lady then, 
since you didn't have a roommate. Well, we were all

12:28.417 --> 12:29.718
roommates. That's it? Yeah. So y'all didn't

12:31.272 --> 12:37.919
use that term, fish old lady? Well, we used the term 
because it was double bunk. Oh, okay. And the one

12:42.764 --> 12:46.387
that doubled with you was your old lady. Who were 
some special friends that you made then that you

12:47.128 --> 12:52.653
recall now? Oh, gosh.

12:56.477 --> 12:58.840
Really, I can't remember that far back. There's 
some that I... and they're all dead. Bell

13:07.056 --> 13:17.929
trot,

13:07.056 --> 13:17.929
necktie, just a few of them. Please describe the 
chow hall routine, ritual. Well,

13:27.600 --> 13:31.705
it wasn't a ritual. It was...

13:33.440 --> 13:41.587
working in the chow hall was probably the best job 
on campus. You could get all the cooks you wanted.

13:44.070 --> 13:45.351
Did you work in the chow hall? I worked in the mess 
hall some. And I also worked in the mess hall when we

13:47.713 --> 13:53.819
went to my campus. But, you know, the manner in 
which you were seated, the upperclassmen would

13:54.559 --> 14:02.046
serve first. line first and they got everything 
passed to them before anybody else started then.

14:11.288 --> 14:17.855
Then I've seen we've had of course the bread 
fights. Describe the bread fight. Well it's

14:22.360 --> 14:28.287
basically what we do is somebody would on one of the 
tables, two or three tables over, try to take a roll

14:28.655 --> 14:39.447
on an upperclassman that was turned the other 
direction. And that usually started that table

14:39.467 --> 14:42.330
throwing back into that table. And the first thing 
you know, it looked like a mirage coming across.

14:48.317 --> 14:50.179
And you threw bread and what else? Well, 
occasionally we got a little sloppy and throw some

14:50.720 --> 14:57.868
other stuff, but it was mainly bread.

14:59.941 --> 15:05.433
Any, describe a typical day, class day. When did it 
begin and what happened when? Go through the whole

15:09.001 --> 15:10.945
day for me. Well, we were always, I forget what time 
we had to be up, but we were always in formation

15:10.965 --> 15:20.025
doing military things before we went to class. And 
if I'm correct, I believe our classes, some of them

15:20.258 --> 15:26.366
started at 7, some of them started at 8. And they 
lasted all through the day, just like we do now. And

15:31.733 --> 15:37.861
at that time, I believe, I don't guess we had any 
weekend classes. I was thinking maybe we did, but I

15:37.881 --> 15:40.004
don't believe we did. But you did have Saturday 
classes. Yes. Did you all march to class? Yes.

15:50.380 --> 15:55.326
When there was a group going to a certain class, 
like a big chemistry lab or something like that,

15:50.380 --> 15:55.326
yes. Did you all fall in for lunch? Yes. And supper. 
What about late in the afternoon? What did you all

16:03.835 --> 16:06.278
do late afternoon? Intramurals

16:06.918 --> 16:11.904
and then study. Then at night? Yeah, the study 
periods at night. And what time lights out? Ten

16:18.712 --> 16:19.172
o'clock. Did anybody ever try to get up after hours 
and move around? They didn't try it, they didn't.

16:26.678 --> 16:27.219
What'd they do? Oh, I know several cases. A couple 
of my buddies and I, we'd slip out and go over to the

16:29.701 --> 16:36.028
Little Brazos and go swimming, things like that. 
We kind of never did veer towards town because we

16:37.650 --> 16:45.358
thought we might get caught. Occasionally we'd go 
across the bridge

16:51.822 --> 16:54.407
and pick up some goodies and come home. Now what was 
over across the bridge? It was a wet area of that

16:56.370 --> 17:00.819
particular region at that time. Two or three 
liquor stores was about the first place you could

17:00.839 --> 17:06.229
buy liquor. Were any of them famous or infamous by 
name? Well we just called it the bridge. It was two

17:12.260 --> 17:13.162
or three of them. Of course you know Before you got 
the bridge, if you was going down on the back roads,

17:14.738 --> 17:23.051
one of the famous beer halls would come Uncle Ed's. 
Now, where was Uncle Ed's? I don't know the highway

17:25.715 --> 17:32.346
number, but it's like you were going to Dimebox, I 
guess, Welbert Road. You're talking about going

17:32.566 --> 17:36.673
south from the main campus? Yeah, from the main 
campus. Was Uncle Ed's and Hard Liquor's the same

17:37.814 --> 17:40.399
place? I've heard of them both. I don't think it 
was. It could have been. It could have been Ed

17:48.683 --> 17:49.804
Hartnaker. It might have been the name. But you're 
right. I've heard of both of

17:52.207 --> 17:56.911
them. Let's see. Your outfit. D. Field, RTOB. What 
was special about it, about that outfit? Well, I

18:04.738 --> 18:14.547
thought we had one of the finer CEOs,

18:04.738 --> 18:14.547
a guy by the name of Harty, out of Houston. And we 
just had a group of people that kind of gelled

18:15.978 --> 18:19.423
together. The camaraderie was good. Anybody got 
in their way, we'd fight for each other. You stayed

18:26.472 --> 18:28.575
with that outfit all through? Stayed with it 
till...

18:33.521 --> 18:36.786
I don't know how to say this. It changed 
designations from right in about that time. It had

18:40.971 --> 18:43.615
to be changed to old. But no, I didn't... take a 
contract. So last year and a half, I was not ready.

18:52.401 --> 18:54.623
But you're in the Corps then for two years. Let's 
see. Food nicknames. Cush or dessert.

19:07.975 --> 19:08.595
Thank you. Lord have mercy. Meat.

19:14.461 --> 19:14.841
Butter. milk, tea? Well, we had some pretty god 
awful nights. That's all I can remember. They

19:22.238 --> 19:25.803
weren't worth repeating in public.

19:26.805 --> 19:30.210
How did you, how did you dress for class? In a horse. 
And what conduct did you think was expected of you

19:32.272 --> 19:36.799
in class?

19:42.126 --> 19:43.208
I hadn't even thought about that.

19:46.293 --> 19:47.795
You were there to listen and learn. Did you go to 
sleep? Occasionally you did, because

19:51.180 --> 20:00.453
upperclassmen had to do a darn lot of stuff, and 
hazing is so bad that you didn't get a whole lot of

19:51.180 --> 20:00.453
sleep. Frank, you then, as a sophomore, you're on 
the main campus? Right. Describe how life was

20:05.240 --> 20:08.364
different then. Not a whole lot different, 
because the freshman class was still out at the air

20:08.384 --> 20:14.713
base. a handful of freshmen on campus. Our outfit, 
by the way, happened to have a couple of them. And,

20:22.474 --> 20:28.703
uh, let me go back to freshman year first. Oh, 
please do. Please do. Uh, Gib Gilchrist was

20:30.505 --> 20:36.574
president of Bayland at that time. And, of course, 
he was very high on trying to stop Beijing. And, uh,

20:43.443 --> 20:44.785
when I was I looked at the hippies of the 60s and 
their rebellion and how they demonstrated and all

20:45.490 --> 20:56.885
this kind of stuff, you know, I think, man, I'm 
never going to part with anything like that. But I

20:56.945 --> 21:05.836
do remember when we were freshmen, we marched on 
Gilchrist's house and hung him an ethargy on the

20:56.945 --> 21:05.836
tree. And so I guess you look back, you express 
yourself in a lot of ways, but I mean the whole core

21:05.856 --> 21:14.367
of us. What happened when you all got to his house?

21:19.544 --> 21:21.326
All I remember is we hung him and added tea. But I 
don't know. I don't know what happened there. I'm

21:25.690 --> 21:27.031
really not certain. Well, what came of that 
protest? Did anything change? I don't think so.

21:37.682 --> 21:42.227
Yeah, that was a, yeah, I remember that . All right, 
dining hall ritual then, you lived in the new core

21:42.443 --> 21:49.113
area, Sevesa or Duncan? We lived, we were at 
Duncan. Duncan. Describe the dining hall ritual

21:52.097 --> 21:54.561
in Duncan. Wasn't much different. It was about the 
same as we had out at the base. All right, so you're

22:00.189 --> 22:06.358
in the, you're eating in Duncan then your 
sophomore year. And then as a DNC, did you continue

22:07.283 --> 22:14.091
to live on campus your junior, senior year? Oh, 
yes. Absolutely. In fact, I lived in the new area.

22:15.994 --> 22:17.235
OK. But you wore a uniform. Yeah. OK. How was life 
then as a sophomore? What privileges did you enjoy

22:26.126 --> 22:29.450
as a sophomore? Well, we really didn't enjoy it as 
much as you would have if you had a crew of freshmen

22:29.951 --> 22:36.919
in your outfit. It wasn't as bitter as it was, the 
hazing wasn't as, at some point, as it was when he

22:37.338 --> 22:45.009
was fresh. And you're talking about a while ago,

22:45.750 --> 22:57.186
getting out after the lights were out and 
everything. Many, many a night, I'd suggest

22:57.206 --> 23:06.079
probably every other night at least, maybe more 
often, we'd always get up and do drown outs.

23:07.409 --> 23:08.390
Describe a drowned out. Well, a drowned out is 
where you go to an upperclassman's room while

23:09.111 --> 23:30.335
they're asleep at night and dump a bucket of water 
or whatever else you might have accumulated on

23:09.111 --> 23:30.335
them and run like heck, hope they don't catch you. 
And then what kind of retribution was there

23:30.355 --> 23:33.779
normally? Oh, if you got caught, it was Katie Boy 
the Dover. Because you got retribution that

23:37.784 --> 23:43.334
didn't last just one day. It usually lasted longer 
than that. Now, did you almost always drown out

23:47.161 --> 23:53.512
someone in a higher academic class than you? Yeah, 
in a higher class where they, you know, like this

23:55.376 --> 24:01.767
is. Describe for

24:03.029 --> 24:14.901
me some samples of Good Bull of the drown outs, 
pranks, jokes.

24:18.084 --> 24:30.657
Well, I can remember one where we put a five gallon 
bucket in there. And all the freshmen come by here

24:31.868 --> 24:36.895
and they didn't tell you it was bull. We used that as 
a draft out for one of our senior officers one night

24:36.915 --> 24:42.644
that everybody just couldn't get along with. I 
mean, there was a lot of fun things like that. Did he

24:46.349 --> 24:47.350
get the message? He got the message.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.761
Any others you can? Well, another prank that we had 
pulled,

25:02.648 --> 25:11.919
to

25:02.648 --> 25:11.919
fill a condom up with water and slip it in the bed 
with them. And sometimes, for warning, they'd

25:11.939 --> 25:19.689
tumble enough to break out and the water would go 
everywhere. Ever any fireworks?

25:27.278 --> 25:30.502
I don't remember. What were the unwritten rules of 
student behavior and pranks and jokes, what were

25:31.960 --> 25:42.711
the things that y'all just wouldn't do?

25:48.558 --> 25:51.481
I don't know what much we didn't do. Did anybody 
ever have a woman in their room at night? Yes.

25:58.688 --> 26:00.330
Describe your room. in the core area? My freshman 
year was hot water. Let's do both. Well, freshman

26:08.183 --> 26:15.611
year, of course, like I indicated, we used a 
barracks farm, double bunks on each side of the

26:08.183 --> 26:15.611
barracks. I'd say there were probably 10 barracks 
on each row, probably about 20 students in a

26:15.831 --> 26:24.900
barracks. And then we were trained, one place for 
everybody.

26:33.313 --> 26:43.122
On the campus, when we were in the dorms, in the core 
dorms, you'd have two or sometimes it'd be three

26:33.313 --> 26:43.122
children. But it was an enclosure. It didn't have a 
bathroom. It wasn't fancy like the dorms are now.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.809
I've been in some recently and they're just pretty 
nice. It was just a concrete floor. No elevators.

26:57.938 --> 26:59.961
Always tires.

27:02.724 --> 27:14.620
I can remember one

27:02.724 --> 27:14.620
occasion in our sophomore year. Somebody had gone 
across the river. It was in the afternoon. And

27:23.152 --> 27:26.376
there was four or five of us in the dorm with a doughy 
shelf. And had it locked.

27:31.944 --> 27:33.846
And we were having a good time. And, uh, we heard a 
knock

27:35.409 --> 27:42.359
on the door. And it was Colonel Borger. They're 
coming.

27:47.887 --> 27:53.315
We didn't know it.

27:53.335 --> 27:55.418
I hollered, the ship will slide under us. And 
somebody opened the door, and when he walked in,

27:57.254 --> 28:07.024
let me tell you, that sobered the crowd up real 
quick.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.126
Let's digress on him. Describe Colonel, then 
Colonel Boehner. He was just a tough old Army guy

28:14.391 --> 28:24.641
that

28:14.391 --> 28:24.641
he wanted you to go by the rule, and that was it. No 
variation.

28:28.912 --> 28:36.663
probably about,

28:28.912 --> 28:36.663
I'm just trying to visualize my mind, the size of 
the man he was. He wasn't that tall, but he was a

28:36.723 --> 28:44.054
well-built, pretty broad fellow. Did you all 
respect him? Well, you did in his presence. Yeah,

28:50.022 --> 28:58.294
you know, in later years, too, you begin to realize 
he was A-OK. Back in this... core dorm room. What

29:00.378 --> 29:01.380
was in that room? A bunk bed, and were they one on top 
of the other or were they separated? No, in ours

29:06.226 --> 29:08.669
there was one on top of each other. And what else was 
in there? That was it. No air conditioning,

29:10.592 --> 29:20.905
nothing like that, and the little thin mattress 
pads and the hot summer and day in College Station.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.407
You'd sweat that thing through in a night. Where 
was the desk? Yeah, there was a It seemed like kind

29:28.413 --> 29:33.157
of a shelf-like thing for a desk, as best I recall. 
There wasn't a whole lot of furniture, maybe a

29:33.478 --> 29:37.341
couple chairs. Alright, and then normally when 
you came from Spring Lake to A&M, what did you bring

29:37.802 --> 29:45.329
as the year began? About a whole lot.

29:51.795 --> 29:55.618
Just, you know, personal effects as far as a lot of 
closed things, you didn't because you'd all go

29:57.978 --> 30:01.501
over the issue of the wheelchair.

30:05.385 --> 30:10.229
We didn't have, none of those kids had televisions 
and things like that to bring them days. Did you

30:10.430 --> 30:11.430
even have a radio? I think we might have had a small 
radio in our garden, but I'm not sure. Who were some

30:19.058 --> 30:23.121
of the memorable teachers, advisors, 
counselors?

30:25.544 --> 30:26.044
Well, I have to say that probably,

30:28.403 --> 30:39.481
what's the old chemistry professor's name? 
Herrington. Dean Herrington. He was probably one

30:42.766 --> 30:47.173
of the better teachers I ever had. I flunked 
Chemistry 101 my first semester. And I took it then

30:51.400 --> 30:54.084
the second semester under him. And under him, I 
loved it. I really was, I really thought he was a

30:56.973 --> 31:01.078
great teacher. What made him a good teacher? I 
really don't know, but I mean, he just made you, he

31:03.161 --> 31:11.791
had something or other that made you interested in 
what he was saying. He had a way about it. Did he have

31:13.333 --> 31:17.839
a nickname?

31:17.859 --> 31:19.340
He had, I don't remember. What about some of the 
other nicknames?

31:23.906 --> 31:26.389
One of my professors,
