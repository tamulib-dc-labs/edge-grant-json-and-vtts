WEBVTT

00:01.786 --> 00:10.098
and we were talking about how you advance in the 
service, and we were talking about the values, and

00:01.786 --> 00:10.098
you mentioned some of the values. And we said 
basically that you didn't think there was a

00:11.340 --> 00:17.629
difference between the business or professional 
world and how you get ahead in the military. You

00:17.689 --> 00:20.453
felt it's the same type of leadership. I wanted to 
ask you, did you consider yourself ambitious? Few

00:26.862 --> 00:28.384
people make it to generals.

00:32.482 --> 00:35.825
I never felt like I was ambitious. I never felt 
along the line that I was shooting to be a general. I

00:42.431 --> 00:43.471
never felt that way. Just deep down, you know, I 
might look like I was to others that I was, you know,

00:43.652 --> 00:58.284
bucking for a generalship, but I never felt

00:43.652 --> 00:58.284
that my goal was to be a general. Just never 
disgusted with anything. I never talked to

01:01.844 --> 01:05.329
Catherine about it. Or my brothers, as close as we 
are. I never said, hell, I'm going to be a general.

01:13.842 --> 01:14.563
Just never did. I just felt that I enjoyed doing 
what I was doing and trying to do the best job I can.

01:20.932 --> 01:22.935
And it just happened. Were you really surprised 
then when you did get that telephone call? I really

01:27.362 --> 01:28.023
did. I wasn't surprised. Let me say this, I've met 
some brigadier generals and even major generals

01:31.342 --> 01:41.991
as a colonel that I often wonder, how in the hell did 
they become generals? And here I am a colonel. You

01:45.875 --> 01:51.760
know, but uh... You just didn't think they had the 
quality to be general officers? No, I just didn't

01:51.780 --> 02:00.387
think they had the quality and didn't know how they 
did it and then found out later it was political and

01:51.780 --> 02:00.387
I said, well, Here I am, a full colonel, and these 
guys are Brigadier General. I'll

02:07.597 --> 02:11.463
give you an example. When I had a direct support 
group as a colonel, my commander was the second one

02:12.164 --> 02:21.557
that took over. You want me to mention names? Only 
if you want to. Well, let me just say he was a

02:27.907 --> 02:30.070
commander. He was a Brigadier General commanding

02:30.404 --> 02:37.673
the Direct Support Brigade. 377 Brigade is what 
Support Brigade is what they called it. And after I

02:43.661 --> 02:50.309
was around him, I said to myself, you know, I said, 
God, dang, how did this guy get to be a general?

02:50.329 --> 02:51.531
Hell, he don't know how to command. He don't know 
how to lead. He don't know how to organize his

02:52.492 --> 02:54.895
staff. He let people, you know, well, his people, 
his own staff was just doing things to me down here

03:00.813 --> 03:07.682
in a group that I was trying to ruin me. I said, I'm 
not going to put up with that stuff. And I'd go to

03:09.265 --> 03:09.925
him. I'd complain to him. He wouldn't do nothing 
about it.

03:14.832 --> 03:18.357
Well, as it turned out, I made Brigadier. He made 
Brigadier. He was still a Brigadier. Then he got

03:20.640 --> 03:29.993
relieved because of his uncouth

03:20.640 --> 03:29.993
attitude and uncouth doings. He went to Fort Hood 
one time and took his brigade headquarters, and

03:32.631 --> 03:42.200
he, the corps commander, three-star general, had 
a party, banquet. And this brigadier general had a

03:42.220 --> 03:46.524
few drinks. Next thing you know, he's putting his 
hand under the waitress's dress. No kidding?

03:52.649 --> 03:52.750
Yeah! Right? Right! In fact, we had a party for him 
in Beaumont. the red carpet in. It was brand new

04:01.080 --> 04:04.866
carpet, red motel, brand new plush. And we had a 
party for him and we had all our wives there and we

04:05.627 --> 04:19.811
had this dinner party and one of the officers come 
to me and says, Colonel Kokonos, what's the

04:05.627 --> 04:19.811
general over there? So I looked around and sure 
enough he had his iron hand underneath the

04:19.831 --> 04:25.360
waitress's dress. And then later on in the 
evening, the waitress came to me and complained to

04:26.757 --> 04:30.122
me about it. I would think so. Oh, sure. She was 
furious. Well, when I heard about his episode at

04:34.869 --> 04:55.279
Fort Hood, he was at the Corps Commander's banquet 
or dinner party, and the girl, the waitress that he

04:34.869 --> 04:55.279
put his hand under her skirt, was the warrant 
officer's wife who was on the Corps Commander's

04:34.869 --> 04:55.279
staff. So much for him. That was the end of him. 
Fifth Army got rid of him quick. Oh, yeah.

05:07.325 --> 05:18.159
So in other words, you'd say that there are, in 
every organization, even in the elites of the

05:07.325 --> 05:18.159
military, you have undesirables that somehow get 
up there. How do they get up there? I don't know. I

05:21.264 --> 05:23.246
don't know how they get up there. They might have 
done well. before they got there, but after they

05:25.195 --> 05:27.457
get there, they change. Oh, I see. They change. 
I've seen it. Probably true. He changed, and this

05:31.601 --> 05:37.807
90th Army Reserve Commander, he changed.

05:42.451 --> 05:46.936
So, you have them. In every organization. In every 
organization. Now, when you retired, do you

05:49.698 --> 05:53.582
remember what you thought on the day of your 
retirement? Do you remember how you felt?

06:00.777 --> 06:02.558
I felt kind of sad. I didn't feel like that I was 
ready to retire. Yeah. And

06:11.807 --> 06:19.615
as it turned out, my records showed I had another 
year to go. No kidding? Really? Really. And

06:25.304 --> 06:29.109
somebody messed it up. And you could have been, 
well, at least one of the three to go up for a

06:29.130 --> 06:36.921
promotion. Yeah, I could have. Oh, I read a 
document. When RCPAC, the St. Louis Reserve

06:40.666 --> 06:53.725
Personnel Department, sent me my retirement 
papers,

06:54.616 --> 06:57.620
Retirement date was 78 instead of 77. I said,

06:57.640 --> 07:04.170
oh, what the hell. It wouldn't do me any good to try 
to stir that up. So I just said it was just the break

07:08.456 --> 07:13.303
of the game, I guess. But I was satisfied, Terry. I 
was satisfied to make Brigadier General.

07:17.009 --> 07:17.750
Absolutely. Oh, I was. And it didn't disappoint me 
because I didn't get promoted further. Would you

07:23.624 --> 07:41.084
say that making generalship was, whenever we take 
a look at a career, I always like to take a look at

07:23.624 --> 07:41.084
what we call successes and shortcomings, not 
necessarily failures, but would you put

07:23.624 --> 07:41.084
generalship, making the rank, as one of the 
successes, right? Right. And the command

07:42.445 --> 07:48.552
positions that you had and the schools that you 
had, what would you put as the shortcomings? Was

07:48.835 --> 07:55.223
there anything that you felt that, gee, I really 
could have done better here, or I could have done

07:48.835 --> 07:55.223
something I didn't quite carry through here?

07:58.347 --> 08:09.722
I can't recall any shortcomings because I think 
I'd have got promoted to general earlier if the 9th

07:58.347 --> 08:09.722
Division would have stayed intact. See, I'd 
already made my mark on division artillery, and

08:09.742 --> 08:14.708
General Kidwell who was my division bigoted 
general, Kickwell, who was my division

08:15.447 --> 08:32.784
commander,

08:15.447 --> 08:32.784
if he had been promoted to major general, I'd have 
been brought right along with him because I did a

08:15.447 --> 08:32.784
good job for him, a damn good job for him. So as far as 
shortcomings, I was always fighting

08:32.804 --> 08:43.935
shortcomings by living in Beaumont because 
Beaumont did not have any reserves. any high

08:44.135 --> 08:45.858
headquarter units here. All we had was battalion 
or lieutenant colonel. They had the school, but

08:48.702 --> 08:58.577
when I organized the 173rd Direct Support Group, 
that's the highest headquarters I've ever been in

08:48.702 --> 08:58.577
Beaumont.

09:01.201 --> 09:02.503
That's certainly an accomplishment. Well, I felt 
so, you know, that they asked me to take that over

09:02.543 --> 09:10.094
and bring it to Beaumont. And Beaumont spread it 
high. I got newspaper clippings about the new unit

09:12.215 --> 09:15.638
in Beaumont. And Beaumont was proud. And by the 
way, we received. Well received. When I got

09:19.983 --> 09:24.027
promoted to Brigadier General, the Chamber of 
Commerce threw a reception for me. Really? I was

09:25.388 --> 09:26.569
the first. Oh, great. What they did, the way they 
did it. You were the first? I was the first

09:32.775 --> 09:41.344
Beaumonter to be promoted to general rank. Native 
Beaumont. I was born and raised here. Native

09:45.094 --> 09:45.775
Beaumont. I was the first Beaumont to be promoted 
to general rank that I know of, that the chamber

09:45.795 --> 09:51.602
knows of. I was the first

09:51.622 --> 10:00.592
reservist in Beaumont to be promoted to general 
rank. And it wasn't easy. It was hard because there

10:01.293 --> 10:04.517
were no units in this area. You know, Houston had 
some general law, but dang, Houston was playing,

10:04.537 --> 10:10.504
you know, they got a lot of competition over there. 
San Antone and Dallas and Fort Worth. And when the

10:14.278 --> 10:18.965
Albuquerque deal came up, I was really surprised. 
And

10:19.325 --> 10:24.031
certainly an accomplishment, though. Well, the 
Chamber of Commerce was really great about it.

10:31.702 --> 10:34.626
Newspapers and the radios and TV. Were you 
interviewed on television or anything? I was

10:37.750 --> 10:40.474
interviewed on television. I told them 
practically what I'm telling you, that I'm proud

10:40.758 --> 10:49.968
that Beaumont has a general officer from this 
area. And today, I'm called upon all the time to be

10:50.469 --> 10:55.574
at some ceremonies. Really? Yeah. Even now that 
you're retired? That I'm retired. Do they want you

10:59.899 --> 11:01.341
to put your uniform on? Want me to put my uniform on 
in 10 ceremonies? The city of Beaumont, two years

11:05.485 --> 11:09.870
ago or a year ago, Let me try to get my dates straight 
now. A year ago, dedicated the Civic Center

11:13.414 --> 11:19.603
complex, the $34 million complex. They asked me to 
be, they asked me as Brigadier General Mike P.

11:19.623 --> 11:32.280
Kokonos to be the master of ceremonies in uniform 
and to work the program up. And I did. I had

11:33.242 --> 11:34.844
flyovers. Really? Oh, yeah. That's neat. The 
minute the four... planes from Ellington Field

11:39.888 --> 11:45.415
flew over, we sang the Star Spangled Banner.

11:47.858 --> 11:51.742
People came to me afterwards and they had tears in 
their eyes. They said, we couldn't help it, but the

11:51.782 --> 12:06.220
minute we sang the Star Spangled Banner and those 
planes came over, zooming like they did, it was

11:51.782 --> 12:06.220
emotional for

11:51.782 --> 12:06.220
them. Just the other day, when Bob Crippen You know 
the space shuttle? The mayor of Beaumont called me

12:12.205 --> 12:16.652
in to sit in, to be with him on the committee. He 
organized three weeks before Crippen came to help

12:17.112 --> 12:23.942
put on the celebration. And he asked me to put on the 
parade for him. Now I didn't, they cited, the

12:29.150 --> 12:38.363
publicity was General Coconose and General 
Coconose, but I didn't put on my uniform that day

12:29.150 --> 12:38.363
because I was putting the parade together. So I 
didn't feel like I needed to do that. I'm asked to,

12:43.294 --> 12:56.068
like Congressman Brooks, he came into town, they 
had appreciation dinner for him about a year or so,

12:43.294 --> 12:56.068
a year ago, and they asked me to lead the Pledge of 
Allegiance and asked me would I wear my uniform. I

12:56.228 --> 12:56.769
said, sure. I'm chairman of the Lamar University 
ROTC committee out there. It's called the

13:05.005 --> 13:08.450
Military Advisory Committee of Lamar 
University. I'm chairman of it. And there's

13:10.072 --> 13:12.796
always functions in the ROTC. So I always put on my 
uniform and go out there and present medals or make

13:13.377 --> 13:20.688
a speech. Well, this is, I think, one of the aspects 
of becoming a general officer. There's so much

13:25.715 --> 13:33.426
interaction once you become a general officer, so 
much more interaction with the community and with

13:25.715 --> 13:33.426
the military. And do you think that that plays a 
role? Do they pick general officers because

13:36.646 --> 13:41.974
they're good or strong personalities? Do you 
think that plays a role? I think that plays a role. I

13:44.878 --> 13:46.280
think the rank plays a role. People love general. 
They love it. When I tell them I'm a general, they

13:50.386 --> 13:55.153
take another look. Really? Oh, yeah. So I think the 
rank. But then the man comes into play. If he can

14:04.507 --> 14:13.800
carry the rank well, he'll be asked to 
participate, and he'll be asked for services to

14:04.507 --> 14:13.800
help celebrate. If he can? If he can't, they won't. 
And I know a couple of Brigadier Generals who moved

14:18.667 --> 14:29.522
into Beaumont working here for corporations, and 
they're not asked to do anything. Maybe they don't

14:29.542 --> 14:31.205
want to be asked. Maybe they're through. For 
example, San Stephen's Episcopal Church asked me

14:34.527 --> 14:45.317
to come out on Flag Day and present them a flag that 
flew over the Capitol. So I did. I went out there,

14:45.857 --> 15:03.353
Catherine and I, and I wore my uniform, I wore my 
dress blues, and got up in front of the

14:45.857 --> 15:03.353
congregation and presented the flag and had it 
blessed, took communion with them, participated

14:45.857 --> 15:03.353
in the service with them, and they were just 
thrilled with that. come up and they look at your

15:04.328 --> 15:10.557
ribbons and they look at, you know, they don't know 
what to do. A lot of people really don't know too

15:10.577 --> 15:13.761
much about the Army. And they look at your ribbons, 
you know, and they hesitate to ask you a question.

15:19.870 --> 15:22.994
So I, you know, I kind of lead them a little bit too. I 
says, you know what this is? What is that? Well,

15:26.639 --> 15:27.680
that's a purple heart. Purple heart. You know, 
they say purple heart. So that's what the purple

15:30.965 --> 15:32.808
heart looks like. I say, yeah, that's a purple 
heart. So we started. And they'd come up and see the

15:36.593 --> 15:40.117
boards, general boards. So the community, I have 
to say I've been well received here. That's great.

15:48.748 --> 15:53.094
I go to the YMCA, and it's not Mike, it's the 
general. Judge Fisher is the federal judge. He and

15:56.718 --> 15:59.342
I are really real friends. We're true friends. And 
it's always general. And I'll go to the Kiwanis

16:04.555 --> 16:12.525
Club, it's general, and I'll go to the church, it's 
general, and I'll go to wherever I go downtown,

16:04.555 --> 16:12.525
it's general.

16:15.389 --> 16:22.819
Thursday, they're having a dedication to the 
county courthouse, and the chairman asked me to,

16:15.389 --> 16:22.819
he wants me to wear my uniform and come down. Well, 
if I was participating in the program, I would. We

16:27.786 --> 16:29.668
just, yeah. And I feel like, when I put on the 
uniform, I... You should be a participant. A

16:34.943 --> 16:36.924
participant, and I want to do it with dignity. 
Yeah. Because it's the rank. You don't just stand

16:38.626 --> 16:39.447
around. Oh, yeah. It's the rank, you know. I 
respect it. Yeah. I respect it, and I try to live up

16:44.311 --> 16:51.638
to the expectations of a general officer. Well, 
let's talk about one of those, and that's back to

16:52.119 --> 16:54.901
the leadership. And it seems you met Patton. And at 
the same time you met Eisenhower, we talked about

16:57.037 --> 17:09.604
this a little bit, Patton is sort of a 
kick-him-in-the-pants type leader, and

16:57.037 --> 17:09.604
Eisenhower is much more of a low-key, Bradley much 
more of a low-key type person. And I was wondering

17:10.285 --> 17:16.699
what type of leader were you?

17:28.964 --> 17:36.734
I wasn't a Patton type in the sense that I talked 
like Patton. You really... That is rough, Alan. I

17:40.138 --> 17:42.522
mean, you set some examples there. I was my own man. 
I was my own self. I mean, I don't know how I can

17:49.190 --> 17:57.621
relate to Eisenhower or Patton or Bradley or... I

17:59.086 --> 18:08.277
was a, I wasn't a talkative gentleman. I didn't 
talk, I didn't say much. And I didn't cuss. Oh, I got

18:15.627 --> 18:18.150
mad and raised hell, you know. Cussed too, but I 
wasn't a foul mouth. Oh no, in fact, I was, I guarded

18:28.583 --> 18:30.846
And I didn't like my officers to be foul-mouthed 
either. If I did, I'd put a stop to it. I think some of

18:35.293 --> 18:47.491
my education, my schooling at A&M in the sciences 
kind of refined me a little bit.

18:52.539 --> 18:56.785
And I had some of my basketball aggressiveness, 
too. And where I get on the basketball court in

18:57.659 --> 19:01.324
Hill, I was tough. Had to be. And

19:03.807 --> 19:18.326
to try to say I was a Patton, or an Eisenhower, or 
Bradley, or Artie Murphy, or Hollinsworth. You

19:18.366 --> 19:18.907
were just a coconuts. I was just coconuts.

19:24.541 --> 19:26.383
Okay, here's another question. The nickname I did 
get was Iron Man. You had a nickname? Iron Man. Iron

19:33.249 --> 19:33.669
Man. I got that from basketball. And it stayed with 
me. It stayed with you throughout your entire

19:37.052 --> 19:39.194
life? I don't know how the Army picked it up, but I 
was known as the Iron Man. In fact, my... Yeah. Let

19:47.261 --> 19:50.204
me show you. Is it running? I'll turn it on. Iron 
Mike.

19:58.107 --> 19:59.889
Why do you think you were called the Iron Man? Well, 
at A&M they called me Iron Man because I played 40

20:01.450 --> 20:06.155
minutes of basketball. Well, why do you think they 
picked it up in the service? Because I was the same

20:10.019 --> 20:11.080
way. I guess I'd get up in the mornings and go, and in 
the evenings I was still going.

20:20.909 --> 20:21.750
I was kind. Well, iron usually sounds like 
somebody who's stern, inflexible,

20:23.047 --> 20:33.280
narrow-minded.

20:35.203 --> 20:36.705
But it doesn't seem like that. It doesn't seem like 
when you mention leadership, the type you were,

20:36.765 --> 20:45.496
you don't seem like you were tough or inflexible or 
narrow-minded or any of those. You're cold. Iron

20:46.277 --> 20:47.078
is cold. Well, I think the Iron Man came in because 
of my durability. Oh, durability. Durability.

20:53.270 --> 21:02.902
Because I'd stay in training,

20:53.270 --> 21:02.902
get up 4.30, 5 o'clock in the morning for Reveille 
and get going. And then at night, at midnight, I'd

21:02.942 --> 21:12.633
be out in the bivouac areas, just visiting with the 
company commanders and see what they're doing,

21:02.942 --> 21:12.633
and go back to bed. And I was up again next morning 
leading PT.

21:18.821 --> 21:22.585
That's one reason why the second brigade The staff 
officers liked me so well because the first time I

21:24.623 --> 21:32.892
went to summer camp, the first order of business 
was PT for the officers. And the sergeant major was

21:33.953 --> 21:40.861
out there selling tickets to enlistment to see the 
officers doing PT because they'd never done it

21:33.953 --> 21:40.861
before. PT, physical training. Oh, okay. You 
know, it was kind of a... The sergeant major was

21:48.770 --> 21:53.014
kind of a sense of humor thing for me. It was all 
right. They loved it. But, I don't know,

21:54.894 --> 22:00.820
leadership, that was myself, you know. Okay, 
here's the assignment. Let's say as a general, and

22:03.723 --> 22:18.219
maybe in the past or in the future you will be asked, 
but as a general you're asked to come back to A&M and

22:03.723 --> 22:18.219
give a talk, a short talk to the Corps on 
leadership. What would you tell them? If they want

22:21.042 --> 22:23.385
to know how to become leaders, what would you tell 
them?

22:28.563 --> 22:31.106
you know out of 2000, maybe two will ever make it.

22:39.154 --> 22:40.215
Not an easy question. No, it's not. It really 
isn't. And you can't sum it up in just a few words

22:42.457 --> 22:44.759
either. You really can't. I mean, you can't come up 
with a cliche and say this is what leadership is.

22:50.605 --> 22:58.553
Leadership is all the aspects that you have in you 
to do the best job

22:59.461 --> 23:09.316
that you can with the best tools that you have 
inside. I

23:09.336 --> 23:24.618
think the main thing is you've got to 
self-discipline yourself to just do.

23:28.163 --> 23:28.624
I'll tell you. You self-dip yourself, and you've 
got to obey the laws, written laws or unwritten

23:29.245 --> 23:44.904
laws, of good behavior and common sense.

23:48.729 --> 23:53.675
You've got to know between right and wrong. If you 
don't know what's right, then you'll never become

23:54.776 --> 23:58.881
a good leader. So you've got to know what's right, 
and you've got to obey the law. Whatever the law,

24:02.656 --> 24:07.321
you've got to be a law-abiding person. You can't 
disregard the laws of the land and expect to be a

24:07.341 --> 24:19.334
leader.

24:23.358 --> 24:24.579
It's not easy, you know. You've got to be yourself. 
If you try to imitate somebody else, you're going

24:29.253 --> 24:33.958
to just screw up right down the line. You can't 
imitate. You can emulate someone. Take the good

24:39.623 --> 24:56.901
points of people

24:39.623 --> 24:56.901
and try to use it within you to lead your people.

24:56.921 --> 24:58.022
Ask me some more questions. OK, fine. I want to turn 
to something now away from the military and away

24:59.780 --> 25:17.590
from leadership, and basically my final topic, 
and that is I want to discuss the major changes at

24:59.780 --> 25:17.590
A&M and your opinion of those changes over the last 
two decades. In this place, it's been known as a

25:17.631 --> 25:21.337
conservative institution. It's really changed 
radically. from 6,000 students in 1960 to 34,000,

25:25.598 --> 25:31.805
admitting women and black. And everything has 
grown in just phenomenal proportions. And I'd

25:37.311 --> 25:40.094
like to have your opinions about that. Let's start 
with women. Do you think this is a positive change,

25:41.815 --> 25:47.341
or what do you think about women being allowed at 
A&M? I think it's a positive change. I think it's

25:48.963 --> 25:50.104
good for A&M. I'm

25:50.124 --> 25:55.470
surprised it wasn't done sooner. Because there's 
no reason to, even when the Corps, when it was all

25:56.159 --> 26:04.146
military, there's no reason to exclude women. 
They could have fitted right in and getting their

26:04.627 --> 26:09.991
education right now. As it turns out now, it's the 
best thing that happened to A&M. They're the best

26:12.854 --> 26:15.877
Aggie supporters we got, the women. My daughter, 
Elise, she's got more Aggie spirit than all of us

26:16.577 --> 26:21.061
put together. So is Suzanne. Suzanne Bruce. And so 
I think it was a very positive step to find women to

26:26.220 --> 26:31.729
come down there. OK, now let's shift from women at 
A&M to women in the reserves. You must have seen

26:37.658 --> 26:42.184
increases of women in the reserves during your 
career. What were your feelings on that?

26:48.674 --> 26:53.942
It wasn't a strong feeling, but it was OK. They 
wanted to play a part of it, and there's a place for

26:54.496 --> 26:58.042
them. We had them in World War II. Sure did. Yeah, 
over in Europe. So there's no reason not to have

27:02.630 --> 27:05.875
them, yeah. And the Red Cross girls were up front, 
too. Instead of servicing supplies, they were

27:08.760 --> 27:14.350
giving us donuts and coffee. So what's the 
difference, you know? They were up front. So I

27:16.794 --> 27:20.200
think it was a good experience. and let the women 
join the reserve. Did you have any problems as a

27:22.439 --> 27:27.726
commanding officer in the reserves with the 
women? Was there any changes or problems that came

27:27.746 --> 27:30.229
up? No problems at camp. We went to camp with them, 
and of course, the latrine situation, and it was

27:31.630 --> 27:45.407
only sleeping quarters, and they had their own 
sleeping quarters and their

27:31.630 --> 27:45.407
own facilities, so that was no problem. They ate in 
the mess hall with us. They trained with us, When I

27:50.723 --> 27:55.590
was in the 75th Mac, we went to the field, they went 
right along with us. Never complained. Cold, a lot

27:57.333 --> 28:01.299
of times it was cold up in Twin Falls, Minnesota. 
Really? Yeah, we went to Fort Ripley, Camp Ripley.

28:05.765 --> 28:06.446
It was cold. And the women were just right there. 
And it was part of it. It was nice to have women

28:10.913 --> 28:14.218
there. What did you think of the average quality of 
the woman reserve? Well, it wasn't. as high as I

28:20.778 --> 28:22.280
thought it ought to be. I tell you,

28:23.001 --> 28:27.446
it was average. OK, now we've already talked about 
blacks in the reserve. What were your thoughts on

28:31.712 --> 28:38.360
blacks coming to A&M, being allowed in A&M? I think 
it was fine that they'd be given the opportunity to

28:38.380 --> 28:47.832
come to A&M. Without lowering our standards, the 
SAT score or academic requirements, I think it's

28:49.685 --> 28:58.256
fine. And as it turned out, I don't think we have any 
problem with it. Do you know of any problem? No. I

29:04.585 --> 29:05.586
don't know of any problem. They're in the band. 
Yeah. And that's really a spree outfit. And so I

29:12.195 --> 29:15.279
think it's good. Yeah. Okay, what do you think of 
the idea of the end of the mandatory corps? General

29:20.436 --> 29:22.219
Rudder ended the mandatory corps. What did you 
think about that at the time of your ideas change?

29:26.425 --> 29:28.027
And I know what you're talking about, your ideas. 
Yeah, well, I've been thinking about what I told

29:28.047 --> 29:32.974
you, too. At that time, at the time it happened, I 
knew it was good for the school, but I had some

29:33.655 --> 29:44.110
regrets. that there would not be compulsory 
military training anymore at Texas A&M. I think

29:51.947 --> 29:57.753
there should be compulsory military training, 
period. And so with A&M doing away with it, it kind

29:57.773 --> 30:13.607
of made me feel a little sad because it deprived our 
army of some good officers. And of course, that

30:14.296 --> 30:17.299
leads to the defense of our country. And it was sad 
for that. But at the time, General Rutter made that

30:21.304 --> 30:25.828
decision. And it was a momentous decision for the 
school. It had to be done. Because the attitude of

30:30.293 --> 30:32.936
the people was going to change. And it wouldn't 
have helped the progress of our university if they

30:33.637 --> 30:42.126
hadn't made that change. We actually declined 
from 1950 to 1960. We sure did. And I kept up with it.

30:48.162 --> 30:50.606
I'm sure all of them and I are the same way. But I was 
aware that A&M was losing strength in their

30:50.646 --> 30:57.095
enrollment. And something had to be done. And I 
think General Rutter

30:58.197 --> 31:05.888
made a bold decision. What did you think of General 
Rutter? Did you know him? I knew General Rutter

31:09.093 --> 31:10.395
very well. Could you describe him?

31:16.683 --> 31:18.045
Very strong person.

31:24.434 --> 31:25.215
Kind person. He was warm. He'd see you, and he just, 
just as nice and friendly as he could be,

31:27.418 --> 31:32.886
remembered your name. He remembered my name. He 
remembered who I was.

31:38.133 --> 31:39.895
And, you know, I played basketball for A&M.

31:44.181 --> 31:45.323
Very likable person. And

31:46.990 --> 31:52.859
he's the type of person that wasn't flamboyant. In 
fact, matter of fact, you know, General Rutter

31:54.202 --> 31:59.971
began to put on a lot of weight. I don't know if you, 
you know, and he, it didn't bother him. He still

32:06.561 --> 32:11.709
soldiered because he, but that didn't bother him. 
He, I mean, he's...

32:15.458 --> 32:17.661
But he would expect the most out of us. We gave him 
the most.

32:23.228 --> 32:24.930
Very fine person. Outstanding person. Anybody 
scale the cliffs of France like he did, what can you

32:26.793 --> 32:33.301
say? What do you think about the growth of the 
institution from 6,000 to 34,000? I think it's

32:40.050 --> 32:43.795
grown a little bigger than I would like for it to be. 
I think 30,000 is just a pretty good size. I'm

32:48.057 --> 32:50.080
afraid it may get unwieldy. I hope it doesn't get 
any larger. Looks like a mine. Yeah, I'm afraid so,

32:54.526 --> 32:56.869
because everybody loves A&M. Golly, I get calls at 
the office, help me get my daughter a dormitory

32:57.990 --> 33:03.818
room. She wants to go to A&M, and if she doesn't get a 
dormitory room, I'm not going to let her go. Oh,

33:08.716 --> 33:09.617
yeah. Really? Oh, yeah. I get them all the time. No 
kidding? Sure. Oh, yeah. That sort of must have

33:14.801 --> 33:17.904
made you feel good, but at the same time kind of sad. 
Can you help her in any way? No, I can't help her. I

33:20.306 --> 33:21.127
didn't think so. No. And parents who went to Rice 
University or SMU would come to me and say, Hey,

33:23.109 --> 33:35.720
Mike, talk to my son and see if you can talk him into 
A&M. Their parents want their children to go to

33:35.740 --> 33:38.082
A&M. which makes me feel great. A&M, I describe it 
as a very healthy school. It really is. No

33:52.414 --> 33:55.599
permissiveness.

33:56.420 --> 33:57.481
It's a friendly school. And the academics, well, 
it's just like Rudder wanted it. It's an

34:02.249 --> 34:03.090
excellency.

34:06.344 --> 34:08.647
And he did it because he built the graduate school 
up. You know that? Oh, yeah. That's what did it.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.933
That brought in some fine professors. And that 
started the school in its academic height that

34:16.055 --> 34:26.287
it's reaching now. But

34:26.307 --> 34:34.596
it doesn't really bother me, Terry, that so many 
people want to go to A&M. It has to get bigger. You

34:39.547 --> 34:41.710
can't stand still. But I think A&M has kept in 
stride with its growth. Unfortunately, we had

34:52.506 --> 35:00.759
this board that fired Jarvis Miller. Well, I was 
sad by that. And they got rid of Jack Williams.

35:09.193 --> 35:09.513
What's going on? Great guy. Oh, Jack Williams. 
Historian, too. Huh? Historian. Yeah, yeah,

35:15.102 --> 35:17.225
that's right. Great guy. I consider him a true 
friend, a real friend. Matter of fact, my son,

35:23.374 --> 35:29.303
Paige, was selling Bibles in West Virginia four 
summers ago. They weren't really Bibles. They

35:31.266 --> 35:33.649
were dictionaries, religious dictionaries. 
Mm-hmm. And he knocked on the door, and he had his

35:34.398 --> 35:49.240
Texas Aggie t-shirt on, and the lady came to the 
door, and he says, I'm Paige Coconuts from Texas

35:34.398 --> 35:49.240
A&M, and I'm here selling dictionaries. She says, 
Paige, you're welcome to come into my house. And

35:54.228 --> 35:56.030
Paige was taken aback. She says, I'm Ms. 
Williamson. Jack is my son. Really? That's right.

36:01.358 --> 36:03.882
And so Paige and Ms. Williamson, they came back. 
Real good friends. She got sick, and Paige was

36:05.849 --> 36:10.954
there to assist her and help her, you know, and do 
anything he could. But he spent three months up

36:10.974 --> 36:12.176
there. And Jack Williamson was so grateful to 
Paige. He said Paige was good medicine for his

36:16.801 --> 36:20.204
mother. That he took Paige into his home, visited 
her, you know. And still today, Paige could walk

36:24.309 --> 36:30.676
into his office anywhere, and he'd stop what he was 
doing, come in here, Paige. You know, he said that

36:30.696 --> 36:32.097
medical stuff. Well, what about the board? What do 
you think about that? I thought it was terrible. I

36:38.837 --> 36:39.258
really do. I think the board was wrong in doing what 
they did. I think it was a power play for the board to

36:45.585 --> 36:57.859
try to ruin

36:45.585 --> 36:57.859
Dr. Williamson and Dr. Miller.

36:58.841 --> 37:00.202
I kind of hope Miller comes back. Do you think he 
will? I think he's under consideration. Have you

37:04.932 --> 37:05.452
heard? No. I've heard. I've heard. He's one of the 
top three. Really? And so is this Lamar president

37:10.096 --> 37:13.279
out here, Bob Kimball. Very fine person. A great 
person. Dr. Kimball. He's a West Point graduate.

37:21.966 --> 37:24.188
He's also a Brigadier General. Yeah. He's a 
historian. Is he? Taught it at West Point for three

37:28.972 --> 37:30.774
years. Really? Yeah. And so he's one of the top 
three. He and Mark Miller and I don't know who the

37:34.430 --> 37:36.653
other four. This is the story I hear. But I thought 
the board did an injustice to Texas A&M. We should

37:43.362 --> 37:45.665
have a more consistent policy. It's hacking away 
at people. I don't think that's the way you should

37:49.390 --> 37:51.032
treat people. Well, it's only two people or one or 
two people on the board that does that. And

37:57.540 --> 37:59.062
unfortunately... They're too powerful. Yeah. 
Well, the chairman became too powerful. He's one

38:02.982 --> 38:05.084
of them. Well, the board calls the fire the 
quitting of Ballard. I was president of the Texas

38:11.510 --> 38:14.993
A&M Letterman Association at the time. And when 
they did that? Yeah, when they did that. Not one

38:17.855 --> 38:24.841
time, Terry, did I hear any complaints about 
Ballard from the alumni, or from the lettermen.

38:25.842 --> 38:31.167
And we met every game in the lounge, and we always 
had a program, and there was always three or four

38:25.842 --> 38:31.167
hundred People in there. You ought to go in there 
sometime. I wish you'd go in there. It's

38:35.464 --> 38:36.866
beautiful. Got pictures all over the wall. All 
Americans. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you'd like it. But they

38:42.573 --> 38:44.155
were in charge of firing. I heard about that. Of 
course, that was before I got here, but they told me

38:46.778 --> 38:50.582
in the archives that story about Billard. 
Billard? Well, you see, the board members were

38:52.224 --> 38:58.592
passing rumors around about getting rid of 
Billard, getting rid of Billard. And so Billard

38:58.612 --> 39:01.255
heard it from his own staff people. And he went to 
see Miller, and Miller said, no, no, no, you're not

39:01.589 --> 39:06.480
going to, Miller fired you. And the lawyer says, 
hell you're not, I quit. Wow. They went out to

39:11.331 --> 39:15.259
Mississippi or something. Yeah, Mississippi 
State, doing great.

39:19.609 --> 39:21.032
Okay, I was wondering about, One last issue. The 
draft and registration of the draft is a big issue

39:22.904 --> 39:26.648
today. And I was wondering, you said you wanted 
everybody to have compulsory military. How would

39:32.875 --> 39:35.197
you do it? What do you mean by that? I would have the 
draft. I would have every young man go into service

39:38.221 --> 39:43.566
for at least six or eight months. Maybe not a year, 
but at least eight months. Sort of an extended boot

39:46.493 --> 39:48.695
camp? That's right. And then a couple, maybe a 
couple months of specialty training. Specialty

39:54.040 --> 40:01.247
training, specializes if he's in communications 
or if he's an artilleryman or infantry or signal or

39:54.040 --> 40:01.247
ordnance. And then come back and get in the reserve 
program for two years.

40:07.774 --> 40:11.978
I believe every young man that graduates from high 
school ought to do it. Right then and immediately.

40:13.199 --> 40:16.382
Right there, before he gets his start in college or 
start in work or whatever you want to do

40:16.700 --> 40:20.765
immediately after graduating. Sort of like 
universal military training. Military

40:22.326 --> 40:23.007
training. I was a proponent of that. Old Truman's 
policy. I was a proponent and I got on and I had many a

40:25.430 --> 40:30.655
discussion with the ministries here in Beaumont 
about that. And I proposed that the UN to universal

40:31.797 --> 40:37.723
military training. And I still do. And now, of 
course, another issue is women in the service,

40:38.764 --> 40:44.891
would they be drafted under your idea? No. I don't 
think women ought to be drafted. I think they ought

40:49.424 --> 40:52.489
to volunteer if they want to. But I don't think we 
ought to draft women. I just don't feel like

40:55.675 --> 40:57.598
drafting women. You

40:58.259 --> 41:03.688
know, I don't feel like drafting. Now, do you think 
that, Eric, versus 1940 versus 1980, Do you think,

41:11.037 --> 41:24.470
looking at it, from what A&M was and what it is 
today, do you think that, would you consider it

41:11.037 --> 41:24.470
today, even though you're probably a little 
nostalgic about the previous period, would you

41:11.037 --> 41:24.470
consider today a better institution?

41:34.380 --> 41:35.061
Yes, I would. I think it's a better institution. 
Because you've had You've had the old grads of that

41:39.877 --> 42:04.269
area, 40, who have come back and supported that 
school and

41:39.877 --> 42:04.269
gone into the world and become executives in the 
business world and who are helping the graduates

41:39.877 --> 42:04.269
today, the young graduates,

41:39.877 --> 42:04.269
get along in this business world. Oh yeah, I think 
it has.

42:11.348 --> 42:12.409
You can't live in the past. The past is good to 
remember, and the past is good to

42:13.470 --> 42:24.183
charter your course for the future. But you can't. 
Oh, man, listen, I'd love to go back to 1940 and live

42:25.905 --> 42:29.809
like I did. You know, I wouldn't have all this worry 
and stuff. But you can't, baby. No. I think A&M

42:38.197 --> 42:45.347
today is one of the finest schools that this 
country has. I thought it was fine in party. For

42:49.313 --> 43:05.436
what it was doing, you know, these six or seven 
thousand of us, eight thousand of us that were

42:49.313 --> 43:05.436
there, compulsory military training in the 
Corps, coming out as officers, going into the war.

43:06.800 --> 43:07.961
They're doing a great job. I think A&M was great. 
Today, the same thing applies. These young people

43:12.167 --> 43:22.380
coming out of A&M and getting into the business 
world, they're only doing the same job that

43:12.167 --> 43:22.380
they're doing in the business world we did back in 
World War II. Same thing. And they got that A&M

43:25.003 --> 43:26.265
training. I cannot, I can't detect the difference 
between a 1979 graduate and a 1939 graduate. I

43:37.765 --> 43:41.831
can't say he was in accord and he wasn't in accord. I 
still get the same handshake. I still get the same

43:46.117 --> 43:47.479
greeting. I still get the same hello. And I still 
get the glow in a guy's face at finishing 79. I

43:53.708 --> 43:56.612
graduated with the same name that I did back in the 
party. Yeah. Of course, I'm more conscious of it

43:59.256 --> 44:04.684
because I got three sons that graduated. And they 
do it. They do the same thing I used to do. They go up

44:08.296 --> 44:11.100
to a stranger and says, I'm Michael Kokonos. And 
they'll see an Aggie ring, and they'll go over and

44:12.622 --> 44:16.007
say, I'm Michael Kokonos, Class 79. And that's 
what we used to do. We still do. So I don't see any

44:20.133 --> 44:23.819
difference. OK. Now, we've covered an awful lot of 
issues in the last couple of days about your career

44:25.041 --> 44:34.114
and a lot of your ideas. What have we missed? There 
must be something that we missed that you want to

44:36.049 --> 44:40.335
talk about because I'm out of questions. You're 
out of questions? Yeah. As far as I know, we've

44:42.038 --> 44:49.930
covered about everything, but there's probably 
something that was really fundamental to your

44:42.038 --> 44:49.930
life that I haven't talked about.

44:56.561 --> 44:57.743
We've covered a lot of territory. Yeah, we sure 
have. So I tell you, it's interesting, Terry, that

45:01.702 --> 45:10.512
this happened to me. It's kind of exciting. You, 
really a stranger, coming into my life and asking

45:13.555 --> 45:21.523
me these questions and really getting in depth 
with me. And I probably don't even do it with my own

45:21.844 --> 45:23.526
brothers. And I wouldn't do it with my own 
brothers.

45:28.631 --> 45:31.354
Because I've expressed myself freely to you that 
I'm I probably wouldn't do it to my own brothers.

45:36.851 --> 45:41.016
You know, if you grow up in a family, how many people 
in your family? Two brothers. Are you the oldest or

45:41.637 --> 45:42.778
the youngest? Middle. Middle. Well, when you're 
around your older brother, you don't say the

45:44.660 --> 45:50.848
things you would like to say.

45:54.132 --> 45:58.417
Yet you come in here, and I've said some things to 
you that I've said. But in my family, we're very

45:58.437 --> 46:03.923
tight-knit, my brothers. We all grew up together. 
I don't think we could accomplish anything

46:06.871 --> 46:14.221
separately like we have together. I had a brother 
right from there. We all got behind him, supported

46:15.362 --> 46:16.764
him. I was his campaign manager. I worked like hell 
to get him elected. And the GP, Janelle, the same

46:20.349 --> 46:24.695
way, and Andrew the same way. Andrew worked for the 
federal judge and did everything he could to help

46:24.715 --> 46:31.264
him in his work. It wasn't easy for him. Same thing 
with Pete, same thing with me, we help each other.

46:41.844 --> 46:49.392
I don't know of an area where we, I may think about 
something tomorrow or next day, but we've covered

46:41.844 --> 46:49.392
it pretty well. Okay.

46:59.702 --> 47:01.804
Yeah.
