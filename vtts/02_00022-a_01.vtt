00:00:02.528 --> 00:00:05.794
Testing, testing, one, two, three, four, one, two, three.

00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:08.539
Testing, one, two, three.

00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:15.210
Thankfully, this is a sunny day after a very cold night.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.137
13th of December, sitting in the Reynolds building,

00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:23.599
having the joy and pleasure of chatting with Dr. Sam Black.

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:32.875
Sam, to introduce yourself to anyone who would hear this tape or read the transcription, describe yourself before you got to A&M.

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:33.997
Where did you grow up?

00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:35.319
What did family do?

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:38.784
Go to high school, college, experience, and so before coming here?

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:45.816
Well, I grew up in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:53.454
small town of about 3,000 when I was a resident there.

00:00:54.335 --> 00:01:11.601
I graduated from Hershey High School and from the Hershey Junior College, which was part of the legacy of Mr. Milton Hershey and his chocolate factory, providing a two-year junior college free for all residents of Hershey.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:26.126
I received my bachelor's degree from another school just a few miles down the road, Lebanon Valley College, a church affiliated school of really very high quality.

00:01:28.508 --> 00:01:41.284
At Lebanon Valley College, I discovered that the academic competition was almost exclusively in the group of pre-meds with whom I was associating.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:52.526
And when it came time for the pre-meds to apply to medical school, Sam Black did likewise, without ever having before expressed any interest in a career in medicine.

00:01:56.232 --> 00:02:06.727
I was accepted to medical school, in fact three of them, Columbia, Cornell, and the University of Pennsylvania, and I went to medical school.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.752
I went to University of Pennsylvania,

00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:14.398
where I completed two years and entered my third.

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:31.478
One day I had just scrubbed in for surgery and on the way from the scrub sink to the operating room, I caught a reflection of myself in a mirror, all capped and gowned and masked.

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:37.545
And I looked at me and I said, oh my God, Sam, is that you?

00:02:39.466 --> 00:02:40.908
And I didn't recognize me.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:57.728
I reported to the surgeon in charge that I could not attend that day, broke scrub, redressed, and paraded into the dean's office and resigned from medical school on the spot.

00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:01.613
Did I never tell you that before?

00:03:01.653 --> 00:03:02.554
Ask.

00:03:03.378 --> 00:03:09.524
Of course, those were the days when the draft was in full swing.

00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:17.112
Immediately, I became subject to the draft because I could no longer qualify for an educational deferment.

00:03:18.814 --> 00:03:23.859
I hastened that whole process by volunteering for the draft.

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.246
I was immediately taken and went and spent two years in the Army.

00:03:31.998 --> 00:03:53.431
I left the Army to enter graduate school at the University of Michigan in the area of microbiology because in medical school microbiology was perhaps my best and certainly best-liked discipline and completed a PhD at the University of Michigan.

00:03:56.776 --> 00:03:59.440
My first professional job was in Texas.

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:08.327
I came to Houston to join the faculty at Baylor College of Medicine, where I spent nearly 10 years.

00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:20.440
One day my wife and I looked at each other and said, hey, wouldn't it be sort of fun to experience a change of seasons again?

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.685
Why don't we move back north if we have an opportunity?

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.749
Well, there was an opportunity.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.542
I was offered a job at Michigan State, and so we moved back to Michigan.

00:04:35.268 --> 00:04:43.146
I must say that first winter was a real revelation, and I couldn't wait to leave Michigan.

00:04:44.172 --> 00:04:51.401
had an opportunity to come back to Texas, and you can believe that I said a very rapid yes.

00:04:52.463 --> 00:04:55.527
And that opportunity, of course, was to come to Texas A&M.

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:02.776
I had met with Dean Jim Knight some months previous.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:07.783
We felt a certain kinship.

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:19.688
and he offered me a job as part of his original cadre to come to A&M with the challenge to see if we could start a medical school at A&M.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.136
How did you become acquainted with Dr. Knight?

00:05:25.618 --> 00:05:30.868
Well, one of my students while I was at Baylor was a fellow by the name of Don Holmquist.

00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:40.543
Don Holmquist entered the space program after completing his MD degree at Baylor College of Medicine.

00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:48.098
He always said that Sam Black was one of his most favorite professors while he was a medical student.

00:05:48.972 --> 00:06:01.770
Don Holmquist was part of the original administrative team for this College of Medicine, and he persuaded Jim Knight that maybe he had a real candidate in Sam Black, and that's how we got acquainted.

00:06:03.172 --> 00:06:11.183
And how long did, after that first contact, how long was it before you decided to get here?

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.010
Weeks, months?

00:06:14.251 --> 00:06:15.252
Oh, I think it was some months.

00:06:15.933 --> 00:06:16.574
I don't remember.

00:06:17.516 --> 00:06:21.663
I met Jim Knight and his wonderful wife Sally for the first time in New Orleans.

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:29.035
Before he took up residence here in College Station, he invited my wife and me to come to New Orleans to meet with them.

00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:36.647
We got along famously, and an invitation to come to A&M followed quite rapidly after that.

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:40.073
Based on your impression at that time,

00:06:40.998 --> 00:06:45.984
What was the A&M medical program going to be like?

00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:49.689
Well, it was an interesting concept.

00:06:49.769 --> 00:07:05.689
It was to be a program that would attempt to knock off two years of the total educational experience by admitting students after just two years of an undergraduate program.

00:07:08.234 --> 00:07:20.712
Those two years would be spent here at Texas A&M, and then the students would be admitted directly to a medical program that would be jointly administered by Texas A&M and Baylor College of Medicine.

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:27.863
And an MD degree would be awarded four years later jointly by the two institutions.

00:07:29.378 --> 00:07:32.644
All right, and then the Baylor affiliation didn't work out.

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:51.201
Well, it didn't work out because the accrediting agency took the position that a dean cannot report to two masters, that a degree could not be awarded simultaneously by two institutions, that it had to be one or the other,

00:07:51.181 --> 00:08:00.454
and how that decision got made I'm not privy to, but eventually Baylor did drop out of the picture.

00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:07.264
That meant that we had to go shopping for another primary clinical site for the education of our students.

00:08:09.026 --> 00:08:19.281
The medical institutions in Temple had been sort of secondary partners I think quite early on, but with the bowing out of Baylor where our students were

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:23.344
originally to have to go to complete the MD degree.

00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:38.125
Since they bowed out, it was then that Scott and White took a dominant position and with funds available from the VA and the VA hospital in Temple became a very major player.

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:46.517
What, when Dr. Knight first chatted with you, what

00:08:47.088 --> 00:08:52.216
did you understand your role to be in the new medical program here?

00:08:53.137 --> 00:08:58.905
Well, my understanding was that eventually I would build a department of medical microbiology.

00:08:59.947 --> 00:09:01.930
And that, in fact, is exactly what I did.

00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.396
And this is the only money question I'm going to ask you.

00:09:06.797 --> 00:09:08.059
What was the beginning salary?

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.262
Oh, I remember that only too clearly.

00:09:12.005 --> 00:09:13.667
My beginning salary was $35,000.

00:09:13.948 --> 00:09:16.251
And your title?

00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:24.928
Program director in microbiology for the program in medicine at Texas A&M University.

00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:33.487
As far as you recall, about how many other professionals had already been employed at that time?

00:09:34.188 --> 00:09:36.754
Oh, I remember that pretty well, too.

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:40.359
There were only two or three in residence.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.023
Jim Knight was here early.

00:09:42.063 --> 00:09:44.227
Don Holmquist was in residence.

00:09:44.247 --> 00:09:50.440
Bill Kirkendall, to handle the business affairs of this nascent program, was in residence.

00:09:52.605 --> 00:09:58.337
I reported for my assignment here on August the 1st of 1975.

00:09:58.418 --> 00:10:11.363
And at the same time, there were at least four others who joined the faculty on that same date, including Dr. Alvin Smith, Dr. Joyce Davis, Dr. Bill Ward.

00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:19.279
Gina, I can't remember if...

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:35.212
I know that Evie Davenport was hired away from Houston to take care of our learning resources unit that was in the process of rather immediately building up a collection of resource materials.

00:10:35.773 --> 00:10:37.676
And Dr. Knight selected all of those?

00:10:37.696 --> 00:10:38.157
Yes, he did.

00:10:38.818 --> 00:10:43.465
And by and large, what was, was there any similarity in their backgrounds?

00:10:44.306 --> 00:10:44.847
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:10:44.907 --> 00:10:48.372
There was one other person in residence at that time, Jackson Wagner.

00:10:48.892 --> 00:10:49.433
Jackson?

00:10:49.853 --> 00:10:54.839
Jackson Wagner, who represented the discipline of anatomy.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.282
And he preceded the rest of us that summer.

00:10:58.342 --> 00:11:09.475
He had been here for about six months and was deeply involved in advertising for new faculty and passed on all those materials to us, respectively.

00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:13.279
The selection was based on disciplines represented.

00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:21.941
It was Jackson in anatomy, Joyce Davis in pathology, Sam Black in microbiology, Elvin Smith in physiology.

00:11:22.883 --> 00:11:26.813
There was no one chosen immediately for biochemistry or for pharmacology.

00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:31.760
And there was no uniformity as to where they came from geographically?

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.791
Well, by coincidence, several of us had experience at Baylor College of Medicine.

00:11:37.152 --> 00:11:44.127
Of course, Joyce Davis and Jack Wagner both came from Baylor, as well as myself.

00:11:44.596 --> 00:11:57.916
Elvin Smith came from a big physiology lab in Mississippi, the Guyton Laboratory of Physiology, and that was well known to Don Holmquist, and I think that's how that came about.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:07.670
We'll interrupt the medicine to talk about, describe your move up here and getting settled into College Station.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:12.898
What was that like for a newcomer?

00:12:16.658 --> 00:12:21.083
We came to Texas by car.

00:12:21.563 --> 00:12:29.852
I had the previous year purchased a little mini Austin car abroad, and that was our only car.

00:12:29.892 --> 00:12:33.035
So we left Michigan.

00:12:34.677 --> 00:12:45.028
We packed up my wife of less than a year and our new child, one month old, born in mid-July,

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:54.409
and drove in caravan with my wife's parents who came to visit us from the Netherlands.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:01.440
And we made the long three-day trip in caravan from Ann Arbor.

00:13:02.662 --> 00:13:07.549
In the middle of summer, we arrived here in time for August the 1st start date.

00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:12.417
That was quite an experience.

00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:17.696
And what did you find as housing accommodations?

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:18.617
Where did you live?

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.985
We had been in touch with the Kirkendalls.

00:13:26.207 --> 00:13:31.534
Betsy Kirkendall was a realtor, and we had pretty much decided that we were going to build.

00:13:33.116 --> 00:13:41.087
My wife and I had made several previous visits to College Station, discovered that there wasn't very much on the market at that time, and certainly not

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:48.951
a home of the design sort of modernistic that we preferred, and we decided to build.

00:13:49.071 --> 00:14:05.134
So we settled into a small two-bedroom apartment at Parkway, on the Southwest Parkway, where we resided for the next eight months, I guess it was, before our house was ready for us.

00:14:05.789 --> 00:14:09.254
And how were you received here?

00:14:09.334 --> 00:14:11.978
What was it like to be a newcomer in College Station Bryant?

00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:35.593
Well, we met some very nice neighbors at Parkway who became our first and perhaps closest friends for a period of time, all of whom were there on a temporary basis and shared some of the newcomer feelings, I'm sure, with us.

00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:48.649
The other new appointees to this new, yet to become a college of medicine, became really fast and close friends.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:55.039
But in general, I think that we felt an exceedingly fine welcome at the university in general.

00:14:57.202 --> 00:15:01.308
It was interesting because space was at a premium.

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:05.614
I remember my first office in the sub-basement of the Teague building.

00:15:06.303 --> 00:15:15.503
I am told that at one point it was considered that the sub-basement of Teague would be the entire medical school.

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:30.876
And I'm not sure how many offices were there, but there weren't very many, plus a laboratory for the instructional program in gross anatomy and a couple of minuscule laboratories that were to be used for teaching in the first two years.

00:15:32.358 --> 00:15:35.903
Now did students, were students enrolled that first fall?

00:15:36.044 --> 00:15:36.244
No.

00:15:37.245 --> 00:15:39.769
We arrived in 75, as I said.

00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:48.021
We could not matriculate any students without provisional accreditation from the liaison committee on medical education.

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:55.092
And that took a while to achieve so that the first students were enrolled in 1977.

00:15:55.332 --> 00:16:01.842
You started in 75.

00:16:02.513 --> 00:16:04.115
and Teague Building.

00:16:05.876 --> 00:16:13.283
Describe your understanding of what Dr. Knight's plan was.

00:16:13.344 --> 00:16:17.127
How was he trying to go about to bring this school into reality?

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:27.938
What was his style, his manner, his movement?

00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:28.318
I don't know.

00:16:28.338 --> 00:16:30.360
I want to answer that.

00:16:33.023 --> 00:16:34.366
Did he appear to have a plan?

00:16:37.532 --> 00:16:40.477
Did it seem he had a plan?

00:16:40.497 --> 00:16:44.225
I'm not ever sure that he had a real plan, in all honesty.

00:16:45.186 --> 00:16:55.386
I had the impression that he thought he could build this new medical school by sitting at his desk in the Teague building without ever going anywhere.

00:16:55.703 --> 00:16:57.786
I think that was his basic undoing.

00:16:58.546 --> 00:17:06.076
I think that his presence was absolutely essential in Temple as relationships with Scott and White and the VA were beginning to form.

00:17:06.917 --> 00:17:09.740
He was not eager to be on the road a great deal.

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:17.289
Was the relation with Scott and White and the VA, was that already solid when you all got here?

00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:20.273
It was still forming.

00:17:20.654 --> 00:17:23.517
Can you share anything about how it was formed?

00:17:25.572 --> 00:17:51.917
gosh who were the people that made it happen as far as your well i do know that uh walter brindley that scott and white was a key figure he sat on the coordinating board i think at the time that the establishment of a new medical school in texas under the auspices of the va was being considered he was a strong ally and has remained to be a strong ally

00:17:51.897 --> 00:17:56.264
for this enterprise ever since and a good solid friend of mine.

00:17:56.645 --> 00:18:10.767
And typist that's Walter with a V. Walter with a V. Kermit Knutson was one of the key players back at that time who

00:18:11.388 --> 00:18:19.238
was eventually given the title Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.204
So you're talking about Kermit Knutson, I believe.

00:18:24.224 --> 00:18:30.151
He became Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs eventually and was in that position for a fair number of years.

00:18:31.573 --> 00:18:39.943
At the VA, those interests were represented by, oh my gosh,

00:18:41.543 --> 00:18:45.671
This old man is having some memory lapses on occasion.

00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:48.276
Gosh.

00:18:48.757 --> 00:18:51.723
But from first, VA was positive in every way.

00:18:51.883 --> 00:18:52.645
Oh, absolutely.

00:18:52.985 --> 00:18:53.506
Absolutely.

00:18:54.248 --> 00:18:56.953
And despite Jim's

00:18:57.271 --> 00:18:59.496
disinterest in a lot of trips to Temple.

00:18:59.836 --> 00:19:09.236
There were those of us who made many, many trips to Temple, and good professional relationships and good solid friendships were the consequence of that.

00:19:09.336 --> 00:19:14.807
Am I correct in my summation to people that

00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:30.059
It appeared to us here that both Scott and White and the VA in Temple were willing to do everything they could to help this medical school succeed as long as it did not impede their medical...

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.562
I think that's very accurate.

00:19:33.043 --> 00:19:34.144
Yes, absolutely.

00:19:34.404 --> 00:19:44.216
Who were the key people outside medicine at Texas A&M University helping the medical program come about?

00:19:44.256 --> 00:19:44.777
Oh, gosh.

00:19:46.462 --> 00:19:48.664
I know that Mac Prescott was...

00:19:49.465 --> 00:19:54.451
He won the vice president of academic affairs in 75.

00:19:55.252 --> 00:20:13.292
No, but he was dean of science, and I remember very well meeting with Mac early after I got here seeking a joint appointment in biology, and he was very supportive, I think, of the program within the university.

00:20:14.013 --> 00:20:15.034
Others that

00:20:16.516 --> 00:20:19.039
Calhoun, Prescott, Calhoun, Wainerdi.

00:20:19.399 --> 00:20:30.270
Calhoun and certainly Wainerdi because it is my understanding that this was in fact Wainerdi's dream that he sold to the higher ups.

00:20:31.932 --> 00:20:40.981
He thought that Texas A&M ought eventually to have some of these other professional programs that make for a true university.

00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:45.325
And so he was a very, very staunch supporter and ally.

00:20:45.575 --> 00:20:48.943
Did you all have any contact early on directly with Dr. Williams?

00:20:50.848 --> 00:21:02.537
I didn't personally except for an interview I sought with Jack K. Williams soon after I got here because I

00:21:03.648 --> 00:21:18.266
had a contact at University of Michigan who knew Jack K. Williams and asked that I please meet with him and pass along this individual's personal regards.

00:21:18.726 --> 00:21:22.531
And so I had a very early opportunity to meet Dr. Williams.

00:21:23.252 --> 00:21:24.273
What was your impression of him?

00:21:24.493 --> 00:21:25.595
Oh, I was very impressed.

00:21:26.436 --> 00:21:30.060
I can remember that rather vividly.

00:21:30.682 --> 00:21:40.392
All right, so during that first year, 75-76, then you all are trying to make arrangements to make things come about.

00:21:40.952 --> 00:21:49.000
What were the major steps between your arrival, time you arrived here, and when the first students enrolled?

00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:50.322
What were the major?

00:21:50.482 --> 00:21:58.630
Well, the major challenge was, of course, building a curriculum that would pass muster with the accrediting people, and we worked very, very hard at that.

00:21:59.116 --> 00:22:04.701
The other was attempting to find faculty who could deliver that educational program.

00:22:05.902 --> 00:22:16.892
And so all of the basic science departments began slowly but steadily to identify people who would fit into this evolving program.

00:22:17.252 --> 00:22:20.775
And did you get some faculty here?

00:22:21.275 --> 00:22:23.097
Oh, yes.

00:22:23.417 --> 00:22:23.978
Not in 1975.

00:22:24.498 --> 00:22:27.621
I believe that I brought in my first faculty in 1970.

00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:28.473
76.

00:22:30.195 --> 00:22:31.758
David McMurray, who is still here.

00:22:31.898 --> 00:22:35.744
John Quarles, who is still here, were two of my original hires.

00:22:36.585 --> 00:22:40.732
And then a year later, Dr. Karin Eiler.

00:22:43.336 --> 00:22:53.271
Karin Eiler, I-H-L-E-R, whose husband was selected as the first head of Department of Medical Biochemistry.

00:22:54.112 --> 00:23:01.039
When you talked to those prospective faculty members, what did you tell them this medical school was going to be?

00:23:06.945 --> 00:23:14.133
I told them that this was a high-risk opportunity, but one that they couldn't afford to miss.

00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:20.760
It is a very exciting thing to be

00:23:21.128 --> 00:23:24.173
be given the privilege of starting with something brand new.

00:23:24.214 --> 00:23:39.181
I was upfront with the people I recruited by saying that there was this program I thought would succeed, but there was almost an equal chance that it would not succeed.

00:23:40.483 --> 00:23:44.470
And they just had to make a gamble.

00:23:45.226 --> 00:23:51.575
Was there any other medical school that you and your colleagues were using as a model?

00:23:52.897 --> 00:23:53.157
No.

00:23:53.918 --> 00:24:01.910
In terms of curriculum design, we did consult with the accrediting agency about curriculum design.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.213
We were given the advice,

00:24:04.683 --> 00:24:05.684
be too experimental.

00:24:06.566 --> 00:24:07.907
Use the tried and true.

00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:10.611
You're more likely to succeed if you do that.

00:24:10.751 --> 00:24:26.353
And so, in fact, those of us who were intimate with curriculum development did choose a fairly traditional model that existed at that time in maybe 75% of all North American medical schools.

00:24:27.194 --> 00:24:33.902
And all of the primary arrangements were taking place in the Teague building.

00:24:34.102 --> 00:24:35.344
Yes.

00:24:35.744 --> 00:24:37.767
The basement and only?

00:24:38.748 --> 00:24:49.180
Well, the dean's office was on the first floor, and the first learning resources unit was on the second floor, but all on the same end of the multi-branch Teague building.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.244
And you all were planning for how many students in the first place?

00:24:52.264 --> 00:24:55.007
We were planning for 32, a class of 32.

00:24:55.628 --> 00:25:05.642
When did you get the first major positive reaction of coordinating board or accrediting agency?

00:25:05.662 --> 00:25:16.778
Do you remember what the first big step was that looked positive?

00:25:16.798 --> 00:25:18.480
No, I'm sorry.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:30.174
Do you know, do you remember anything about when the decision was made, when and how the decision was made to back away from the link to Baylor?

00:25:33.378 --> 00:25:35.680
Yeah, I think that came in 1976.

00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:43.590
I remember a delegation of us, a small one, accompanying Dean Jim Knight to the Texas Medical Center.

00:25:44.009 --> 00:26:02.899
We had a high-powered meeting in the doctor's club, and it became apparent that Baylor was not terribly willing to give up control.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.123
They wanted full control or none.

00:26:05.677 --> 00:26:18.240
and we took the position that they couldn't have full control, that we were in residence and we were in charge of our own program, and I think that's what led me ultimately to their backing down.

00:26:19.883 --> 00:26:26.014
Did you get the impression that any of the medical schools already existing in Texas opposed A&M?

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.872
I don't have a good sense of that, Haskell.

00:26:30.533 --> 00:26:31.734
That probably is true.

00:26:32.315 --> 00:26:32.915
No, I don't know.

00:26:33.456 --> 00:26:34.196
I don't know that.

00:26:34.376 --> 00:26:46.387
I mean, we kept hearing rumors that we were new and small and highly vulnerable and that there were those folks not in sympathy with the development of one more medical school.

00:26:48.469 --> 00:26:57.317
But, in fact, A&M had been approved by the Coordinating Board for the beginning of a new medical program sponsored through the T. Cranston Bill.

00:26:57.297 --> 00:27:03.306
That bill was, what, of 1974 or something in that era.

00:27:08.314 --> 00:27:14.823
We did have some visitors from other, at least one other medical school visit here.

00:27:15.104 --> 00:27:23.136
Charlie Mullins from the University of Texas was a consultant somewhere along the line, and he seemed to be highly supportive.

00:27:23.943 --> 00:27:25.345
this new program.

00:27:26.026 --> 00:27:28.230
You mentioned the Teague-Cranston bill.

00:27:28.551 --> 00:27:29.352
Yes.

00:27:29.732 --> 00:27:32.617
Did you see much of Congressman Olin Teague?

00:27:32.978 --> 00:27:35.762
I never met Congressman Olin Teague, unfortunately.

00:27:36.524 --> 00:27:39.068
I'm sorry that that never happened.

00:27:39.589 --> 00:27:44.196
Let me add as a editorial note to this tape,

00:27:45.037 --> 00:28:01.942
one day in a comparatively extended, in terms of number of people, discussion, I remember Mr. Teague saying he wished that he could do something to help fund it, but that he couldn't think of anything he could do in Washington.

00:28:04.105 --> 00:28:06.589
But as chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee,

00:28:07.008 --> 00:28:17.702
that he really was saddened by the fact that there was not close relationship between medical schools and VA hospitals.

00:28:18.103 --> 00:28:20.686
That if they would do that, he might could help.

00:28:20.706 --> 00:28:25.012
Yours truly in the back row said, there's a VA hospital in Temple.

00:28:26.614 --> 00:28:29.558
And he made a note of some sort.

00:28:30.379 --> 00:28:31.580
And within about a year.

00:28:31.741 --> 00:28:32.582
Well, that paid off.

00:28:34.124 --> 00:28:35.766
I don't know whether there's any link or not.

00:28:36.016 --> 00:29:02.388
But Mr. Teague certainly was a positive person in Washington, D.C. And in fact, the Teague Cranston bill supported initially the establishment of at least four, maybe there were six, new medical schools in close affiliation with veterans hospitals in various parts of the country.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.652
I remember well...

00:29:05.952 --> 00:29:22.645
After Jim Knight was here and settled and submitted a request for additional funds to the Veterans Administration on top of the original appropriation, that Texas A&M was awarded a grant from the VA of $17 million.

00:29:22.625 --> 00:29:28.410
which we were told at the time was the largest grant this university had ever gotten from a federal source.

00:29:30.972 --> 00:29:42.382
Then in the middle of all of this effort in 1976, the centennial year of Texas A&M, Dr. Williams has his heart attack.

00:29:43.623 --> 00:29:43.783
Yes.

00:29:44.604 --> 00:29:51.990
Did his illness and being promoted to chancellor, did it change?

00:29:52.358 --> 00:29:55.062
hurt the medical school's progress?

00:29:55.082 --> 00:29:57.685
I'm not aware that it really did hurt.

00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:11.505
The presidency was assumed by Jarvis Miller, and my recollection is that Jarvis Miller was highly supportive of this new medical school.

00:30:11.605 --> 00:30:21.859
It began about the time that his presidency began, and he was almost willing to tie his rising star to this rising academic program that was new to the campus.

00:30:21.839 --> 00:30:28.589
And Dr. Prescott becomes the new Vice President of Academic Affairs, and he was supportive, as Calhoun had been.

00:30:32.194 --> 00:30:38.824
Do you remember the visit by any of the liaison committee accreditation folks?

00:30:38.844 --> 00:30:40.826
Did they come here for an on-site visit?

00:30:40.846 --> 00:30:41.247
Oh, yes.

00:30:41.648 --> 00:30:42.349
And what was it like?

00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:45.934
And I don't have any remembrance of any of those meetings, unfortunately.

00:30:46.274 --> 00:30:46.935
I just don't have none.

00:30:47.176 --> 00:30:48.538
But you don't remember any negative?

00:30:48.678 --> 00:30:50.260
I don't remember anything negative.

00:30:50.662 --> 00:30:59.193
Do you remember when word came of a positive reading by the LCMA?

00:30:59.874 --> 00:31:04.580
Oh, I think that it was in the late winter or early spring of 77.

00:31:06.723 --> 00:31:10.669
We had barely six months in order to gear up to admit a first class.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:20.061
That began in September of 77, and we couldn't really do anything with admissions until we had gotten that provisional accreditation.
