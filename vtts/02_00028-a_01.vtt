WEBVTT

00:02.056 --> 00:31.030
Let's just start off first of all, you know, we're talking a little bit about the picture on the wall. Tell me a little bit about those three individuals, which would be your great-granddad, granddad, and dad then, right? Right. And kind of where they came from, why they settled in Garwood. Okay, well, my...

00:32.549 --> 01:02.300
Grandfather was experiencing, as I recall from the stories, respiratory problems, possibly pneumonia, and he was told that the best thing for him to do was to move south, that the cold weather would not be good for him over the years. So he and his father somehow got down here and founded and built in 1928 the Richmond Irrigation Company.

01:03.093 --> 01:25.587
for him to have a livelihood. So that was W.S.? W.S. and W.K. and W.N. Okay and so it was W.S. that came down with his dad or was it W.K. with his dad W.S.? W.K. with his dad W.S.

01:27.410 --> 01:56.823
And so they started the irrigation company in 1928. Yes. Okay. How did they go about, did they have water rights in, or did they acquire them, or did they buy the company, or how did they really get it started? Oh, boy. I know that the water rights were the eldest on the river of 1900, weren't they? Yes, and I think they were actually acquired through the state.

01:57.548 --> 02:19.081
okay then they weren't actually I think at that time they they assigned them to you but you didn't buy them there was no value to them at that time yeah right because because they had owned the Garwood Irrigation Company and the Richmond Irrigation Company both

02:19.925 --> 02:46.047
and later sold the Richmond Irrigation Company and just kept the one in Garwood because it was more profitable at the time. Now whenever they established that, the Garwood Irrigation Company, what all did they have to do? Did they have to put in canals and things like this? Yes. Well here,

02:48.089 --> 03:16.962
work on the canals was declared to have commenced on November 1st 1900 with about two miles having been completed and further construction contemplated most of the canals were built with mules and scrapers Mr. L.R. Brayton Mr. W.H. Shaw maternal grandfather of William and Lair built these canals okay yeah that was pretty typical I think in those times too

03:17.333 --> 03:42.578
develop those canals with mules as well as roads and everything else pretty much at the time and then the first plant was constructed in the fall of 1900 and spring of 1901 pumping plant and so what area did it cover or or where did it grow to cover

03:44.165 --> 04:12.295
Oh, wow. Well, the canal system covers area in Colorado County and parts of Wharton County. Okay. And I think it was... How many miles is it? About 200 miles of canal. Yeah. It winds just like a river. But it's at least about 200 miles of canal. Now, was this water over the years used primarily for rice or cotton or a combination or...?

04:12.869 --> 04:37.321
rice primarily rice uh they did water a little bit of row crop out of it but mainly rice it was for rice irrigation purposes okay now uh your family was also involved in the rice industry is that right yes very much so did so whenever they first got started along about the time with the canal today they start farming rice then

04:38.165 --> 05:03.545
Or had they been farming rice before? No, I think they started because they had the canal system and they wanted other farmers to get on the canal system as well. So they went into it also, that as you understand it. They formed a company corporation called L7 Ranch that actually did the farming. So that was one of the companies that Bill actually had that farms rice, still farms rice today.

05:05.030 --> 05:30.713
so uh about how many acres did he start off with in over the years I mean where has it grown to? I don't know what he started off with yeah from the beginning I don't know I know that we farmed on L-7 ranch uh back in the I would say in 78 to 80 we were farming 2,500 acres of rice just L-7 alone

05:30.713 --> 05:55.165
now uh they probably farm close to about 800 acres just because of the farm programs it reduced it not that the land's not farmed anymore a lot of it is tenant farmed but farming it yourself in order to to survive you have to farm the program now yes it's cut to a little over maybe 800 acres yeah but the land owned by uh

05:56.887 --> 06:26.300
by William and Lair and his sister and his sister uh it's quite a few acres yeah about 15,000 acres and so in addition to rice what are some of the other crops that you've been farming well they tried soybeans at one point in time and decided that wasn't the way to go and then other than that we just use the land for grazing cattle

06:26.536 --> 06:55.612
It's sandy soil. You cannot grow corn, milo. They've tried that. That hasn't worked out. Yeah, it dries out pretty quick, doesn't it? Yeah, so basically it's rice land. Tell me what you remember from whatever stories that were told in the family or whatever about, let's start off with W.S. Lear and a little bit about him.

06:57.637 --> 07:11.187
Gosh, all I remember is that we called him Pop, and I really don't remember that much about him. I was very young when he passed away, and I don't remember many stories being told about him.

07:11.812 --> 07:36.989
Yeah well you're actually pretty lucky to get to know your great-granddad anyway. At whatever age, right. Do you know any stories? No. I don't either. Not about him. Okay, well then what about your granddad? That's W.K., right? Right. Well, I can remember some funny stories about him.

07:37.613 --> 08:04.006
he was very generous he was very much a worth ethic kind of person and he had a lot of foresight in my opinion and so far as when he put this all together with the credit union and and then the profit sharing for such a small community and um but he was a speed demon and he always had to have a corvette even when he was elderly

08:04.512 --> 08:26.281
he really liked speed what do you remember yeah well i didn't know him that long uh he passed away right before i came to work here well right after i came a few months later but i know one thing about them they were always for technology because when i first came here uh to work in 1978 uh

08:26.855 --> 08:52.623
They had actually a computer system here, and you didn't have very many computers in 1978. Not very many people had one, and they had a Singer System 10 computer. I'll never forget that. When I came here, I couldn't believe it. It took up a whole room. But he was one of the fellows that was always, and Bill was too, any new technology that was out there to help advance anything, he was for that. And he, you know, spent the money to try to get the technology there.

08:53.197 --> 09:20.973
Now, did he influence Bill to go to A&M, or how did Bill wind up with going to A&M in ag engineering? Was it because of the technology influence from his dad, or? Probably. Of course, Daddy went to Culver, and that was influenced by his parents, and then I think he was basically told that he needed to come home and go to A&M.

09:21.445 --> 09:46.623
and of course he was in the corps and I don't know that he was told that he had to go into ag engineering I know one day we were driving somewhere and I said what what had you really intended to do when you went to college and he said engineering but he did not put ag before that well at that time

09:47.365 --> 10:17.133
if you came from a farm background that's usually where you went into was was ag engineering but he even said that he didn't really have any idea that he'd actually stay here and be in Garwood until I guess after the war really is when he came back didn't go back to school and went to work here yeah his father did he ever make any comments about anybody at A&M that really had an influence on his life any of his teachers or programs

10:20.423 --> 10:44.335
No, the only thing I know of that and his grandson is at A&M now and he thought the most important thing was the Corps. It gave you discipline and he wanted his grandson to be in the Corps but that didn't happen. He's not in the Corps? No. My son, he came to A&M to get in the Corps.

10:44.858 --> 11:10.981
And he got there, and he come back home one day and he said, Dad, you know, I'm not ready to take this yet. He said, I've got to learn to study and do a few things. He never did go back to the Corps, which I thought was great. It's not for everybody. No. But back in those days, he didn't have much choice. But did he have any stories about him being in the Corps, any of the pranks that he played on other people or they played on him?

11:13.698 --> 11:30.050
No, I think the only thing that I guess really stuck out in my mind is how everything had to be just perfect. I mean, your shoes shined, and I mean, he really stressed how everything had to be just so. And if it wasn't, boy, you heard about it.

11:30.995 --> 11:57.910
and I think he tried to impress that upon us and make us part of the Corps in his own way. Was he pretty strict then? Yeah, he was. He was strict, but that's good too. Oh yes, there's nothing wrong with that at all, Matt. Was he looking for perfection like they were looking in the Corps in his life as well as in all of you and your brothers and sisters?

11:58.484 --> 12:26.817
No, not in the strictest sense. I think he may be more so out of himself than his family. Wouldn't you say? Yeah, I would say so. What about his work ethic? Did that carry through from generation to generation then? No. Well, I think from his father's, he learned a lot from his father. I know he was a lot like his father was, and he was a real...

12:27.307 --> 12:50.003
conscientious worker, and he thought things through. He didn't make any hasty decisions on very many things at all. And he brought along Nancy. He trained her in some of the oil and gas matters here. But I guess he didn't really

12:50.746 --> 13:20.345
require the children to learn about the businesses that he had here. Nancy's really the only one. Paul, which is his son, does work here, but I think he took Nancy aside more and trained her in the more important parts, which was the irrigation company and now that it's sold, but in the oil and gas and the water end of it. But his dad, how did he train him to come into the business?

13:21.357 --> 13:49.184
Oh, well, he had to start at the very bottom. We always heard that. You always have to start at the bottom and work your way up. He started on the canal system with a shovel and with the workers as far as putting in pipes and putting in overflows and all. He actually started working on the bottom line.

13:49.673 --> 14:14.868
and kind of worked his way up. His dad didn't just give him an office. His dad made him start from the bottom. So I remember several times he'd say, well, you know, he worked at the bottom of that shovel and dumped those culverts out of a truck and rolled them down the hills and put them in. So he started at the bottom. He learned the irrigation company. He learned. Now, did he expand the business beyond

14:15.256 --> 14:42.492
what his dad was doing, or into other businesses from there? Well, yeah, I think he definitely expanded. Right. He went into, I know at the time, probably they didn't, they expanded into the drying facility, and they, we sell fertilizer and chemicals down the road, they're about a mile,

14:42.830 --> 15:11.720
So he went into all phases of rice farming as far as he farmed rice. He supplied water to the rice farmers and himself also. He sold fertilizer and chemicals for rice crops and row crop. And also we have a drying facility where we actually dry the rice for the farmers. So they expanded in that area. So they basically went right up through vertical integration. Right. And then he really,

15:12.935 --> 15:28.358
Even though they had always had oil and gas leases on the land here, he and another gentleman formed a small little exploration company and really got involved with that. And so he expanded that too.

15:30.586 --> 15:59.459
Okay, where did he go to get his engineering expertise, or I shouldn't say engineering, but the geology expertise, was that the other individual? That was the other individual, he was a geologist, and they just kind of had an arm's length agreement and just started drilling wells, shallow wells above 5,000 feet and to this day we retain the top 5,000 feet. I see, okay. And we lease the rest to the bigger guys.

16:00.505 --> 16:27.877
I noticed some rigs coming down. Are they going down deep here now? Yeah. I think at home they're fixing to go around some place between 15 and 18,000. I'm not sure exactly where they're going. It'll be interesting to see what happens. Right. What about your mother and her side of the family?

16:28.383 --> 16:56.699
what is the history there was she from Garwood or no now I don't know how pertinent this is do you want to know about his he was married prior to my mother and his first wife died during the polio epidemic oh okay I wasn't aware of all of this I didn't know if you wanted that information or I think it'd be good if that's okay with you yeah that's fine with me and she was Barbara Hudson from El Campo okay

16:57.678 --> 17:27.344
And, uh... He had two children? Two children, Paul and Gretchen, which are my half-brother and sister. And then, um, then, oh, I, two or three years after she passed away, he met my mother. At the time, my mother, uh, was a, an airline stewardess for, uh, I think it was CNS before it became Braniff Airlines.

17:28.863 --> 17:55.660
and then and she was from west and west virginia and they met and they married she moved to garwood and didn't realize what she was moving to from the mountains to the prairie and has been here ever since yeah did she play uh we'll get into some of their hobbies and where they were and things that they did together but

17:56.318 --> 18:24.415
Did she get involved in the water business at all, or it was just a supportive type role? Very supportive. I would expect you to need a lot of support. So she probably heard all the stories and tales and everything else that was taking place. Oh yes, right. Did he have to spend a lot of time in legislative type matters or going to Austin?

18:25.411 --> 18:46.606
as it relates to water yes he did didn't he oh yes he was uh we're trying to see here he was on the board of directors of american rice growers and blue ribbon rice mills

18:46.893 --> 19:15.445
And he was actually president of American Rice Incorporated, and that now is a facility that's in Freeport that handles most of the rice in the area. He was actually president of that. Then he was the organizer and the first president of the U.S. Rice Legislative Group and member of the National Rice Advisory Committee. So he was real involved in the rice arena in this part of the area. He's one of the ones that helped with the farm bill and all.

19:16.053 --> 19:34.868
I'll give you a copy of this. This is some of the things that we... So now, he not only traveled just to Washington, but he traveled internationally too on behalf of the rice industry. Right, right. Because there's one country over there, I can't remember now, that people still...

19:35.358 --> 20:02.881
ask about him is that right saudi arabia yeah and he's the only person they ever ask about so he must have had very good relationships with him he did he did and in fact um whoever he was dealing with over there i remember my he and my mother met them in greece because they also had a home in greece and they invited them over and al fadl and i can't remember her name but very lovely couple

20:03.455 --> 20:31.484
And they did have a grand rapport, which of course was important for what they were trying to accomplish. Oh yeah, when you go international it's personal relationships that make the difference. Makes all the difference. With the water business, what were some of the problems that he encountered over the years and what did he do to solve them?

20:36.040 --> 21:04.475
Well, I know from the beginning, at one point, we were having trouble when LCRA built their dam, I think, up in around Bay City area. The river flow was below our suction pipes. So Bill went through the process of building a low-water dam, and there's a picture of it right there behind you.

21:05.015 --> 21:30.395
but built that low water dam, that's a million dollar dam, that there were no funds from the state at all. He tried to get some funds to help build that dam, and he couldn't get any funds from the state to help build that dam. But he paid for it and built that dam so that the suction pipes you'll see up there to the left would be under the water again in order to pump the water into our canal system.

21:32.032 --> 21:56.450
So that was a big undertaking at that time to go through with the proper procedures to get the state to okay it and get the engineers and the proper people to build that dam and it's still in existence today. That's the picture of the river plant and right to the left you can see the canal. Right, just where it started.

21:59.605 --> 22:26.453
That was a real large project that he had undertaken in order to help the farmers in this area survive. Yeah, and when did he do this? I have to look at, it was probably in the early 80's, probably 81. Yeah, okay. So in reality when it's all said and done, this whole area down here, the farmers probably owe him

22:27.432 --> 22:51.952
quite a debt of gratitude for what he was doing, being able to get water to them to allow them really to successfully farm, I guess. That's right, because you cannot farm rice without water, and these farmers could not afford to actually go out and pay to dig a water well to 10-inch, 12-inch well to water their rice fields. It's just...

22:54.044 --> 23:14.193
So that's why there was really a rice industry in this area then compared with down on the Gulf Coast. I think a lot has to do with the water supply and a lot has to do with the type of soil that you have here because rice grows real good in this sandy soil also.

23:15.087 --> 23:33.380
But your main water supply, they have a pumping plant. There's one in Eagle Lake, there's one in Garwood, and there's one in Bay City. And there's rice growing off of each one of those systems. What about cattle? Do you spend much time with cattle? Mm-hmm.

23:34.460 --> 23:58.979
yeah he uh in fact in a way that was almost his favorite thing it was the ranching part of it especially when he was a lot younger and uh I don't know uh we we still have cattle and it's still a big part of our business I don't know what would you add to that Ralph

24:01.865 --> 24:18.892
Where did he pick up his expertise with cattle? Was it through his dad? I guess maybe just through his dad and maybe the farmers in the area. He's always run. There's some pictures there of some of the cattle that he's had. He had the land.

24:19.567 --> 24:47.107
And rice on a rotation-type basis. Right. Okay. You can't farm the whole 17,000 acres of it, and some it's not farmable. But what wasn't, well, he'd always have cattle to take in the area where the rice was sitting, you know, the land dormant for two-, three-year rotation. Well, and he also always had good ranch managers. A couple of them I remember really well.

24:48.018 --> 25:13.330
who were very knowledgeable in the cattle business. And I think he just, you know, learned from them all that he knew and it evolved more or less. Did he change anything? Did he go to crossbreeding or anything at it at any particular times? Or has he pretty much stayed with the same type of cattle over the years?

25:15.187 --> 25:42.625
I think in this area he stayed pretty well at the same time. He didn't get into any registered herds or anything like that, mainly for breeding purposes or anything like that. He just pretty well always, you know, probably had anywhere from 500 to a thousand head of cattle and maybe even more than that.

25:42.862 --> 26:02.268
That's a sizable cow operation. If you look at percentages of, I mean you fall in the top tier of 1-2% in terms of cattle numbers when you get up to that. So it's a sizable operation from that standpoint.

26:09.389 --> 26:38.903
What is your fondest memory about your mother? I'm putting you on the spot now a little bit. The fondest memory about my mother? Well, jeez, yes, you are putting me on the spot. I would have to say

26:39.933 --> 27:06.882
Her strength in, she's had rheumatoid arthritis since she was 35. And she has never ever complained that much about it. And just her strength in dealing with that pain through the years as well as being a supporting, loving wife and mother.

27:07.591 --> 27:31.739
Because being married to a man like my father took a lot of support just because of his travels, all that he was involved in. Have they always lived out there where she lives now, or did they live someplace else at one time? They started out in El Campo.

27:33.055 --> 27:55.482
And then they moved to Garwood to a little house behind his parents' home while they built the house that she presently lives in. That's a lovely place, Donner. It is, isn't it? It's very, very nice from there. Tell me a little bit about yourself. Where did you go for your education?

27:57.743 --> 28:23.849
Well, I was, uh, I went to St. Mary's Hall in San Antonio for two years, then I went to All Saints Municipal Girls School in Vicksburg, Mississippi for four years, and then I went to Wharton Junior College for two years, or one year, one year, and then I went to Baylor in Waco, Baylor University. And you were, are, are a registered nurse, is that right?

28:24.592 --> 28:48.706
Yes. Did you practice for her? Oh yeah, I practiced for about 13 years. I see. In Houston area? No, in Dallas in intensive care and post-anesthesia recovery. You've seen a lot then. Yeah. But I have to tell you one of the reasons that my father wanted me to go to Baylor is his first wife went to Baylor.

28:49.381 --> 29:16.212
And Aggies always dated Baylor girls. And that was very important to him. That's interesting. What about Mary? My sister? I know that Mary, she went to All Saints Episcopal Girls School. She, however, did not finish there. She decided that she needed to come home and

29:16.718 --> 29:42.841
be in a co-educational environment and graduated from Rice High School. I think she has some secretarial courses from Wharton Junior College and then she worked for an attorney for quite some time in Wharton. Does she still live in the area then? Yes, she lives in Sugar Land not far from me. Oh, okay. And she has two daughters.

29:43.870 --> 30:12.423
And do you have children also? No, I don't. Were you all pretty close? Yeah, we are. That's great. What about your half-brother and half-sister? Okay, my sister Gretchen, she went to St. Mary's Hall and then transferred to All Saints and graduated from All Saints. Then she went to the University of Texas and was an art major.

30:13.857 --> 30:43.017
but never finished and I'm not real sure what was more important than finishing. I don't recall that. And she is married and has a daughter, Sarah, and lives in Mill Valley, California. Okay. And then he works here with y'all? William Paul. He works here and he's married and he has two children, Dudley and Lacey.

30:43.709 --> 31:06.592
And one of those is at A&M then? Yes, Dudley is. And Paul went to Sam Houston State? Yeah. That's pretty good stage for all of you going to the college in some way, shape, or form at one time. Right, right. He also went to San Marcos Baptist Academy, too.

31:09.629 --> 31:26.808
Did your mother have much influence on your education? I think they decided jointly. Well, of course, my father went away to school.
