WEBVTT

00:02.056 --> 00:11.027
Let's

00:02.056 --> 00:11.027
just start off first of all, you know, we're 
talking a little bit about the picture on the wall.

00:12.028 --> 00:21.479
Tell me a little bit about those three 
individuals, which would be your

00:12.028 --> 00:21.479
great-granddad, granddad, and dad then, right? 
Right. And kind of where they came from, why they

00:22.380 --> 00:29.228
settled in Garwood. Okay, well, my... 
Grandfather was experiencing, as I recall from

00:32.549 --> 00:48.586
the stories, respiratory problems, possibly 
pneumonia, and he was told that the best thing for

00:32.549 --> 00:48.586
him to do was to move south, that the cold weather 
would not be good for him over the years. So he and

00:49.547 --> 01:02.320
his father somehow got down here and founded

00:49.547 --> 01:02.320
and built in 1928 the Richmond Irrigation 
Company. for him to have a livelihood. So that was

01:07.179 --> 01:08.962
W.S.? W.S. and W.K. and W.N. Okay and so it was W.S. 
that came down with his dad or was it W.K. with his

01:21.461 --> 01:23.163
dad W.S.? W.K. with his dad W.S.

01:27.410 --> 01:31.254
And so they started the irrigation company in 
1928. Yes. Okay. How did they go about, did they

01:34.198 --> 01:41.446
have water rights in, or did they acquire them, or 
did they buy the company, or how did they really get

01:34.198 --> 01:41.446
it started? Oh, boy. I know that the water rights 
were the eldest on the river of 1900, weren't they?

01:51.998 --> 01:56.843
Yes, and I think they were actually acquired 
through the state. okay then they weren't

01:57.548 --> 02:19.101
actually I think at that time they they assigned 
them to you but you didn't buy them there was no

01:57.548 --> 02:19.101
value to them at that time yeah right because 
because they had owned the Garwood Irrigation

01:57.548 --> 02:19.101
Company and the Richmond Irrigation Company both

02:19.925 --> 02:27.838
and later sold the Richmond Irrigation Company 
and just kept the one in Garwood because it was more

02:19.925 --> 02:27.838
profitable at the time. Now whenever they 
established that, the Garwood Irrigation

02:29.060 --> 02:34.528
Company, what all did they have to do? Did they have 
to put in canals and things like this? Yes.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.067
Well here, work on the canals was declared to have 
commenced on November 1st 1900 with about two

02:48.089 --> 03:05.509
miles having been completed and further 
construction contemplated most of the canals

02:48.089 --> 03:05.509
were built with mules and scrapers Mr. L.R. 
Brayton Mr. W.H. Shaw maternal grandfather of

03:07.151 --> 03:16.982
William and Lair built these canals

03:07.151 --> 03:16.982
okay yeah that was pretty typical I think in those 
times too develop those canals with mules as well

03:17.333 --> 03:42.598
as roads and everything else pretty much at the 
time and then the first plant was constructed in

03:17.333 --> 03:42.598
the fall of 1900 and spring of 1901 pumping plant 
and so what area did it cover or or where did it grow

03:17.333 --> 03:42.598
to cover Oh, wow. Well, the canal system covers 
area in Colorado County and parts of Wharton

03:45.727 --> 03:51.793
County. Okay. And I think it was... How many miles 
is it? About 200 miles of canal. Yeah. It winds just

03:59.862 --> 04:01.704
like a river. But it's at least about 200 miles of 
canal. Now, was this water over the years used

04:06.669 --> 04:12.315
primarily for rice or cotton or a combination 
or...? rice primarily rice uh they did water a

04:12.869 --> 04:37.341
little bit of row crop out of it but mainly rice it 
was for rice irrigation purposes okay now uh your

04:12.869 --> 04:37.341
family was also involved in the rice industry is 
that right yes very much so did so whenever they

04:12.869 --> 04:37.341
first got started along about the time with the 
canal today they start farming rice then Or had

04:38.165 --> 04:40.128
they been farming rice before? No, I think they 
started because they had the canal system and they

04:40.168 --> 04:46.658
wanted other farmers to get on the canal system as 
well. So they went into it also, that as you

04:47.660 --> 04:50.825
understand it. They formed a company corporation 
called L7 Ranch that actually did the farming. So

04:57.916 --> 05:03.565
that was one of the companies that Bill actually 
had that farms rice, still farms rice today. so uh

05:05.030 --> 05:11.521
about how many acres did he start off with in over 
the years I mean where has it grown to?

05:15.728 --> 05:30.733
I don't know what he started off with yeah from the 
beginning I don't know I know that we farmed on L-7

05:15.728 --> 05:30.733
ranch uh back in the I would say in 78 to 80 we were 
farming 2,500 acres of rice just L-7 alone now uh

05:30.713 --> 05:55.185
they probably farm close to about 800 acres just 
because of the farm programs it reduced it not that

05:30.713 --> 05:55.185
the land's not farmed anymore a lot of it is tenant 
farmed but farming it yourself in order to to

05:30.713 --> 05:55.185
survive you have to farm the program now yes it's 
cut to a little over maybe 800 acres yeah but the

05:30.713 --> 05:55.185
land owned by uh by William and Lair and his sister 
and his sister uh it's quite a few acres yeah about

05:56.887 --> 06:26.320
15,000 acres

05:56.887 --> 06:26.320
and so in addition to rice what are some of the other 
crops that you've been farming well they tried

05:56.887 --> 06:26.320
soybeans at one point in time and decided that 
wasn't the way to go and then other than that we just

05:56.887 --> 06:26.320
use the land for grazing cattle It's sandy soil. 
You cannot grow corn, milo. They've tried that.

06:32.303 --> 06:33.224
That hasn't worked out. Yeah, it dries out pretty 
quick, doesn't it? Yeah, so basically it's rice

06:35.027 --> 06:36.829
land.

06:40.413 --> 06:52.588
Tell me what you remember from whatever stories 
that were told in the family or whatever about,

06:40.413 --> 06:52.588
let's start off with W.S. Lear and a little bit 
about him. Gosh, all I remember is that we called

06:57.637 --> 07:04.673
him Pop, and I really don't remember that much 
about him. I was very young when he passed away, and

07:04.693 --> 07:11.207
I don't remember many stories being told about 
him. Yeah well you're actually pretty lucky to get

07:11.812 --> 07:16.499
to know your great-granddad anyway. At whatever 
age, right. Do you know any stories? No. I don't

07:21.026 --> 07:22.708
either. Not about him. Okay, well then what about 
your granddad? That's W.K., right? Right. Well, I

07:30.820 --> 07:37.009
can remember some funny stories about him. he was 
very generous he was very much a worth ethic kind of

07:37.613 --> 08:04.026
person and he had a lot of foresight in my opinion 
and so far as when he put this all together with the

07:37.613 --> 08:04.026
credit union and and then the profit sharing for 
such a small community and um but he was a speed

07:37.613 --> 08:04.026
demon and he always had to have a corvette even when 
he was elderly he really liked speed what do you

08:04.512 --> 08:26.301
remember yeah well i didn't know him that long uh he 
passed away right before i came to work here well

08:04.512 --> 08:26.301
right after i came a few months later but i know one 
thing about them they were always for technology

08:04.512 --> 08:26.301
because when i first came here uh to work in 1978 uh 
They had actually a computer system here, and you

08:26.855 --> 08:31.260
didn't have very many computers in 1978. Not very 
many people had one, and they had a Singer System 10

08:31.540 --> 08:35.725
computer. I'll never forget that. When I came 
here, I couldn't believe it. It took up a whole

08:37.847 --> 08:38.828
room. But he was one of the fellows that was always, 
and Bill was too, any new technology that was out

08:39.729 --> 08:48.999
there to help advance anything, he was for that. 
And he, you know, spent the money to try to get the

08:49.239 --> 08:52.643
technology there. Now, did he influence Bill to go 
to A&M, or how did Bill wind up with going to A&M in ag

08:53.197 --> 09:02.409
engineering? Was it because of the technology 
influence from his dad, or? Probably. Of course,

09:09.879 --> 09:20.993
Daddy went to Culver, and that was influenced by 
his parents, and then I think he was basically told

09:09.879 --> 09:20.993
that he needed to come home and go to A&M. and of 
course he was in the corps and I don't know that he

09:21.445 --> 09:46.643
was told that he had to go into ag engineering I know 
one day we were driving somewhere and I said what

09:21.445 --> 09:46.643
what had you really intended to do when you went to 
college and he said engineering but he did not put

09:21.445 --> 09:46.643
ag before that well at that time if you came from a 
farm background that's usually where you went

09:47.365 --> 10:17.153
into was was ag engineering but he even said that he 
didn't really have any idea that he'd actually

09:47.365 --> 10:17.153
stay here and be in Garwood until I guess after the 
war really is when he came back didn't go back to

09:47.365 --> 10:17.153
school and went to work here yeah his father did he 
ever make any comments about anybody at A&M that

09:47.365 --> 10:17.153
really had an influence on his life any of his 
teachers or programs

10:20.423 --> 10:31.057
No, the only thing I know of that and his grandson is 
at A&M now and he thought the most important thing

10:20.423 --> 10:31.057
was the Corps. It gave you discipline and he wanted 
his grandson to be in the Corps but that didn't

10:31.458 --> 10:35.623
happen. He's not in the Corps?

10:41.211 --> 10:41.271
No. My son, he came to A&M to get in the Corps. And he 
got there, and he come back home one day and he said,

10:44.858 --> 10:50.928
Dad, you know, I'm not ready to take this yet. He 
said, I've got to learn to study and do a few things.

10:53.652 --> 10:55.716
He never did go back to the Corps, which I thought 
was great. It's not for everybody. No. But back in

10:58.260 --> 11:03.689
those days, he didn't have much choice. But did he 
have any stories about him being in the Corps, any

11:04.771 --> 11:11.001
of the pranks that he played on other people or they 
played on him?

11:13.698 --> 11:21.012
No, I think the only thing that I guess really stuck 
out in my mind is how everything had to be just

11:13.698 --> 11:21.012
perfect. I mean, your shoes shined, and I mean, he 
really stressed how everything had to be just so.

11:26.764 --> 11:30.070
And if it wasn't, boy, you heard about it. and I 
think he tried to impress that upon us and make us

11:30.995 --> 11:37.764
part of the Corps in his own way. Was he pretty 
strict then? Yeah, he was. He was strict, but

11:41.308 --> 11:43.651
that's good too. Oh yes, there's nothing wrong 
with that at all, Matt. Was he looking for

11:47.857 --> 11:57.930
perfection like they were looking in the Corps in 
his life as well as in all of you and your brothers

11:47.857 --> 11:57.930
and sisters? No, not in the strictest sense. I 
think he may be more so out of himself than his

12:00.486 --> 12:05.492
family. Wouldn't you say? Yeah, I would say so. 
What about his work ethic? Did that carry through

12:11.840 --> 12:14.543
from generation to generation then?

12:18.147 --> 12:18.407
No. Well, I think from his father's, he learned a 
lot from his father. I know he was a lot like his

12:22.993 --> 12:26.837
father was, and he was a real... conscientious 
worker, and he thought things through. He didn't

12:32.255 --> 12:35.600
make any hasty decisions on very many things at 
all. And he brought along Nancy. He trained her in

12:42.691 --> 12:46.097
some of the oil and gas matters here. But I guess he 
didn't really require the children to learn about

12:50.746 --> 12:55.292
the businesses that he had here. Nancy's really 
the only one. Paul, which is his son, does work

12:57.054 --> 13:12.635
here, but I think he took Nancy aside more and 
trained her in the more important parts, which was

12:57.054 --> 13:12.635
the irrigation company and now that it's sold, but 
in the oil and gas and the water end of it.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.365
But his dad, how did he train him to come into the 
business? Oh, well, he had to start at the very

13:21.357 --> 13:27.883
bottom. We always heard that. You always have to 
start at the bottom and work your way up. He started

13:34.490 --> 13:46.742
on the canal system with a shovel and with the 
workers as far as putting in pipes and putting in

13:34.490 --> 13:46.742
overflows and all. He actually started working on 
the bottom line. and kind of worked his way up. His

13:51.335 --> 13:53.578
dad didn't just give him an office. His dad made him 
start from the bottom. So I remember several times

13:55.101 --> 14:05.936
he'd say, well, you know, he worked at the bottom of 
that shovel and dumped those culverts out of a

13:55.101 --> 14:05.936
truck and rolled them down the hills and put them 
in. So he started at the bottom. He learned the

14:08.439 --> 14:09.941
irrigation company. He learned. Now, did he 
expand the business beyond what his dad was doing,

14:15.256 --> 14:19.522
or into other businesses from there?

14:26.251 --> 14:29.234
Well, yeah, I think he definitely expanded. 
Right. He went into, I know at the time, probably

14:31.858 --> 14:42.512
they didn't, they expanded into the drying 
facility, and they, we sell fertilizer and

14:31.858 --> 14:42.512
chemicals down the road, they're about a mile, So 
he went into all phases of rice farming as far as he

14:42.830 --> 14:47.755
farmed rice. He supplied water to the rice farmers 
and himself also. He sold fertilizer and

14:52.520 --> 14:56.184
chemicals for rice crops and row crop. And also we 
have a drying facility where we actually dry the

14:56.604 --> 15:00.288
rice for the farmers. So they expanded in that 
area. So they basically went right up through

15:04.112 --> 15:07.375
vertical integration. Right. And then he really, 
Even though they had always had oil and gas leases

15:12.935 --> 15:26.513
on the land here, he and another gentleman formed a 
small little exploration company and really got

15:12.935 --> 15:26.513
involved with that. And so he expanded that too. 
Okay, where did he go to get his engineering

15:30.586 --> 15:39.797
expertise, or I shouldn't say engineering, but 
the geology expertise, was that the other

15:30.586 --> 15:39.797
individual? That was the other individual, he was 
a geologist, and they just kind of had an arm's

15:39.837 --> 15:55.615
length agreement and just started drilling 
wells, shallow wells above 5,000 feet and to this

15:39.837 --> 15:55.615
day we retain the top 5,000 feet. I see, okay. And we 
lease the rest to the bigger guys. I noticed some

16:00.505 --> 16:02.648
rigs coming down. Are they going down deep here 
now? Yeah. I think at home they're fixing to go

16:07.333 --> 16:11.458
around some place between 15 and 18,000. I'm not 
sure exactly where they're going. It'll be

16:14.882 --> 16:17.845
interesting to see what happens. Right.

16:24.033 --> 16:27.897
What about your mother and her side of the family? 
what is the history there was she from Garwood or no

16:28.383 --> 16:56.719
now I don't know how pertinent this is do you want to 
know about his he was married prior to my mother and

16:28.383 --> 16:56.719
his first wife died during the polio epidemic oh 
okay I wasn't aware of all of this I didn't know if

16:28.383 --> 16:56.719
you wanted that information or I think it'd be good 
if that's okay with you yeah that's fine with me and

16:28.383 --> 16:56.719
she was Barbara Hudson from El Campo okay And, 
uh... He had two children? Two children, Paul and

17:00.380 --> 17:05.325
Gretchen, which are my half-brother and sister. 
And then, um, then, oh, I, two or three years after

17:06.566 --> 17:14.493
she passed away, he met my mother. At the time, my 
mother, uh, was a, an airline stewardess for, uh, I

17:15.313 --> 17:27.364
think it was CNS before it became Braniff 
Airlines. and then and she was from west and west

17:28.863 --> 17:55.680
virginia and they met and they married she moved to 
garwood and didn't realize what she was moving to

17:28.863 --> 17:55.680
from the mountains to the prairie and has been here 
ever since yeah did she play uh we'll get into some

17:28.863 --> 17:55.680
of their hobbies and where they were and things 
that they did together but Did she get involved in

17:56.318 --> 18:01.665
the water business at all, or it was just a 
supportive type role? Very supportive. I would

18:05.110 --> 18:06.752
expect you to need a lot of support. So she probably 
heard all the stories and tales and everything

18:07.613 --> 18:12.940
else that was taking place. Oh yes, right. Did he 
have to spend a lot of time in legislative type

18:16.965 --> 18:24.435
matters or going to Austin? as it relates to water 
yes he did didn't he oh yes he was uh

18:25.411 --> 18:46.626
we're trying to see here

18:25.411 --> 18:46.626
he was on the board of directors of american rice 
growers and blue ribbon rice mills And he was

18:46.893 --> 18:54.842
actually president of American Rice 
Incorporated, and that now is a facility that's in

18:46.893 --> 18:54.842
Freeport that handles most of the rice in the area. 
He was actually president of that. Then he was the

18:58.786 --> 19:06.034
organizer and the first president of the U.S. Rice 
Legislative Group and member of the National Rice

18:58.786 --> 19:06.034
Advisory Committee. So he was real involved in the 
rice arena in this part of the area. He's one of the

19:12.001 --> 19:15.465
ones that helped with the farm bill and all. I'll 
give you a copy of this. This is some of the things

19:17.676 --> 19:21.082
that we... So now, he not only traveled just to 
Washington, but he traveled internationally too

19:21.102 --> 19:27.715
on behalf of the rice industry. Right, right. 
Because there's one country over there, I can't

19:30.300 --> 19:34.888
remember now, that people still... ask about him 
is that right saudi arabia yeah and he's the only

19:35.358 --> 20:02.901
person they ever ask about so he must have had very 
good relationships with him he did he did and in

19:35.358 --> 20:02.901
fact um whoever he was dealing with over there i 
remember my he and my mother met them in greece

19:35.358 --> 20:02.901
because they also had a home in greece and they 
invited them over and al fadl and i can't remember

19:35.358 --> 20:02.901
her name but very lovely couple And they did have a 
grand rapport, which of course was important for

20:03.455 --> 20:09.361
what they were trying to accomplish. Oh yeah, when 
you go international it's personal

20:10.242 --> 20:14.046
relationships that make the difference. Makes 
all the difference.

20:21.253 --> 20:31.504
With the water business, what were some of the 
problems that he encountered over the years and

20:21.253 --> 20:31.504
what did he do to solve them?

20:36.040 --> 20:47.314
Well, I know from the beginning, at one point, we 
were having trouble when LCRA built their dam, I

20:36.040 --> 20:47.314
think, up in around Bay City area. The river flow 
was below our suction pipes. So Bill went through

20:56.886 --> 21:04.495
the process of building a low-water dam, and 
there's a picture of it right there behind you. but

21:05.015 --> 21:12.627
built that low water dam, that's a million dollar 
dam, that there were no funds from the state at all.

21:13.809 --> 21:18.476
He tried to get some funds to help build that dam, 
and he couldn't get any funds from the state to help

21:13.809 --> 21:18.476
build that dam. But he paid for it and built that dam 
so that the suction pipes you'll see up there to the

21:19.097 --> 21:30.415
left would be under the water again in order to pump 
the water into our canal system. So that was a big

21:32.032 --> 21:45.152
undertaking at that time to go through with the 
proper procedures to get the state to okay it and

21:32.032 --> 21:45.152
get the engineers and the proper people to build 
that dam and it's still in existence today.

21:50.941 --> 21:54.647
That's the picture of the river plant and right to 
the left you can see the canal. Right, just where it

21:54.727 --> 21:56.470
started.

21:59.605 --> 22:04.931
That was a real large project that he had 
undertaken in order to help the farmers in this

21:59.605 --> 22:04.931
area survive. Yeah, and when did he do this? I have 
to look at, it was probably in the early 80's,

22:09.015 --> 22:13.700
probably 81. Yeah, okay. So in reality when it's 
all said and done, this whole area down here, the

22:16.843 --> 22:26.473
farmers probably owe him quite a debt of gratitude 
for what he was doing, being able to get water to

22:27.432 --> 22:34.904
them to allow them really to successfully farm, I 
guess. That's right, because you cannot farm rice

22:34.924 --> 22:50.229
without water, and these farmers could not afford 
to actually go out and pay to dig a water well to

22:34.924 --> 22:50.229
10-inch, 12-inch well to water their rice fields. 
It's just... So that's why there

22:54.044 --> 23:06.081
was really a rice industry in this area then 
compared with down on the Gulf Coast. I think a lot

23:06.101 --> 23:14.213
has to do with the water supply and a lot has to do 
with the type of soil that you have here because

23:06.101 --> 23:14.213
rice grows real good in this sandy soil also. But 
your main water supply, they have a pumping plant.

23:18.132 --> 23:21.138
There's one in Eagle Lake, there's one in Garwood, 
and there's one in Bay City. And there's rice

23:21.238 --> 23:23.622
growing off of each one of those systems.

23:27.369 --> 23:29.273
What about cattle? Do you spend much time with 
cattle? Mm-hmm. yeah he uh in fact in a way that was

23:34.460 --> 23:58.999
almost his favorite thing it was the ranching part 
of it especially when he was a lot younger and uh I

23:34.460 --> 23:58.999
don't know uh we we still have cattle and it's still 
a big part of our business I don't know what would

23:34.460 --> 23:58.999
you add to that Ralph

24:01.865 --> 24:04.209
Where did he pick up his expertise with cattle? Was 
it through his dad? I guess maybe just through his

24:07.254 --> 24:11.941
dad and maybe the farmers in the area. He's always 
run. There's some pictures there of some of the

24:14.385 --> 24:16.849
cattle that he's had. He had the land. And rice on a 
rotation-type basis. Right. Okay. You can't farm

24:24.074 --> 24:29.582
the whole 17,000 acres of it, and some it's not 
farmable. But what wasn't, well, he'd always have

24:29.622 --> 24:38.755
cattle to take in the area where the rice was 
sitting, you know, the land dormant for two-,

24:29.622 --> 24:38.755
three-year rotation. Well, and he also always had 
good ranch managers. A couple of them I remember

24:44.864 --> 24:47.127
really well. who were very knowledgeable in the 
cattle business. And I think he just, you know,

24:51.723 --> 24:58.792
learned from them all that he knew and it evolved 
more or less. Did he change anything? Did he go to

25:04.279 --> 25:08.544
crossbreeding or anything at it at any particular 
times? Or has he pretty much stayed with the same

25:10.587 --> 25:13.350
type of cattle over the years? I think in this area 
he stayed pretty well at the same time. He didn't

25:20.214 --> 25:31.029
get into any registered herds or anything like 
that, mainly for breeding purposes or anything

25:20.214 --> 25:31.029
like that. He just pretty well always,

25:31.089 --> 25:42.645
you know, probably had anywhere from 500 to a 
thousand head of cattle and maybe even more than

25:31.089 --> 25:42.645
that. That's a sizable cow operation. If you look 
at percentages of, I mean you fall in the top tier of

25:45.546 --> 25:54.277
1-2% in terms of cattle numbers when you get up to 
that. So it's a sizable operation from that

25:56.741 --> 26:02.288
standpoint.

26:09.389 --> 26:13.053
What is your fondest memory about your mother?

26:17.158 --> 26:18.980
I'm putting you on the spot now a little bit. The

26:19.000 --> 26:24.106
fondest memory about my mother?

26:29.953 --> 26:34.658
Well, jeez, yes, you are putting me on the spot. I 
would have to say Her

26:39.933 --> 26:48.182
strength in, she's had rheumatoid arthritis 
since she was 35. And she has never ever complained

26:48.202 --> 26:52.967
that much about it. And just her strength in 
dealing with that pain through the years as well as

26:53.007 --> 27:06.902
being a supporting, loving wife and mother. 
Because being married to a man like my father took a

27:07.591 --> 27:19.485
lot of support just because of his travels, all 
that he was involved in. Have they always lived out

27:19.525 --> 27:28.976
there where she lives now, or did they live 
someplace else at one time? They started out in El

27:29.657 --> 27:31.759
Campo. And then they moved to Garwood to a little 
house behind his parents' home while they built

27:33.055 --> 27:41.165
the house that she presently lives in. That's a 
lovely place, Donner. It is, isn't it? It's very,

27:45.430 --> 27:48.333
very nice from there. Tell me a little bit about 
yourself.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.502
Where did you go for your education? Well, I was, 
uh, I went to St. Mary's Hall in San Antonio for two

27:57.743 --> 28:20.005
years, then I went to All Saints Municipal Girls 
School in Vicksburg, Mississippi for four years,

27:57.743 --> 28:20.005
and then I went to Wharton Junior College for two 
years, or one year, one year, and then I went to

27:57.743 --> 28:20.005
Baylor in Waco, Baylor University. And you were, 
are, are a registered nurse, is that right? Yes.

28:25.113 --> 28:26.094
Did you practice for her? Oh yeah, I practiced for 
about 13 years. I see. In Houston area? No, in

28:31.922 --> 28:37.390
Dallas in intensive care and post-anesthesia 
recovery. You've seen a lot then. Yeah. But I have

28:41.656 --> 28:48.726
to tell you one of the reasons that my father wanted 
me to go to Baylor is his first wife went to Baylor.

28:49.381 --> 28:53.165
And Aggies always dated Baylor girls. And that was 
very important to him. That's interesting. What

29:00.013 --> 29:01.175
about Mary? My sister? I

29:02.496 --> 29:10.986
know that Mary, she went to All Saints Episcopal 
Girls School. She, however, did not finish there.

29:13.989 --> 29:16.232
She decided that she needed to come home and be in a 
co-educational environment and graduated from

29:16.718 --> 29:21.366
Rice High School. I think she has some secretarial 
courses from Wharton Junior College and then she

29:23.008 --> 29:34.347
worked for an attorney for quite some time in 
Wharton. Does she still live in the area then? Yes,

29:37.873 --> 29:40.337
she lives in Sugar Land not far from me. Oh, okay. 
And she has two daughters. And do you have children

29:43.870 --> 29:45.972
also? No, I don't. Were you all pretty close? Yeah, 
we are. That's great. What about your

29:53.121 --> 29:57.766
half-brother and half-sister? Okay, my sister 
Gretchen, she went to St. Mary's Hall and then

29:59.468 --> 30:08.118
transferred to All Saints and graduated from All 
Saints. Then she went to the University of Texas

30:09.099 --> 30:12.443
and was an art major. but never finished and I'm not 
real sure what was more important than finishing.

30:18.403 --> 30:19.985
I don't recall that. And she is married and has a 
daughter, Sarah, and lives in Mill Valley,

30:20.025 --> 30:27.856
California. Okay. And then he works here with 
y'all? William Paul. He works here and he's

30:37.790 --> 30:43.037
married and he has two children, Dudley and Lacey. 
And one of those is at A&M then? Yes, Dudley is.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.464
And Paul went to Sam Houston State? Yeah.

30:55.611 --> 31:01.883
That's pretty good stage for all of you going to the 
college in some way, shape, or form at one time.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.306
Right, right. He also went to San Marcos Baptist 
Academy, too.

31:09.629 --> 31:18.068
Did your mother have much influence on your 
education?

31:19.632 --> 31:22.298
I think they decided jointly. Well, of course, my 
father went away to school.
