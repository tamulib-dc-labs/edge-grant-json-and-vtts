WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:07.040
I thought he was a little fruity, and I hired him.

00:08.843 --> 00:15.772
The premise was that he was going to come here and finish his doctorate in Missouri, and he never has finished his doctorate.

00:15.792 --> 00:20.078
He's been here now for almost 20 years, 15 years.

00:22.121 --> 00:25.526
But he's doing a terrific job.

00:25.546 --> 00:29.211
He's an excellent conductor, good musician.

00:29.680 --> 00:36.251
Would we be well advised to create a full degree program in music at A&M?

00:37.353 --> 00:39.778
I think it's eventually a must.

00:40.018 --> 00:44.846
If we're going to be, quote, a top 10 university, let's get with it.

00:45.387 --> 00:46.890
Yes.

00:48.212 --> 00:49.174
I hope, though,

00:50.808 --> 00:56.276
I hope that the senior cadets won't be forced to take credit.

00:57.858 --> 01:06.309
Because I think it'll destroy part of their philosophy and image within themselves.

01:06.850 --> 01:19.988
Well, and also, one of the things I've wondered about, all of those musical organizations, if they become the sole property, put that in quotation marks, of the Department of Music,

01:20.592 --> 01:25.519
then they lose their campus-wide involvement popularity.

01:25.820 --> 01:26.341
Exactly.

01:27.102 --> 01:29.465
Now, there's no question A&M needs a music department.

01:31.228 --> 01:35.234
But it's probably one of the most expensive departments you could have on campus.

01:35.254 --> 01:35.554
Yes.

01:35.795 --> 01:40.482
With practice rooms and pianos and electronics and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:41.303 --> 01:44.828
And all the teachers, the private teachers and so forth that you need.

01:45.871 --> 01:49.135
But if it's going to be a university, let's get with it.

01:49.195 --> 01:52.119
I mean, let's stop giving it word service and get after it.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.424
But I know the bottom line is money, again, always.

01:58.306 --> 02:00.329
And I just hope they don't force.

02:01.650 --> 02:14.646
I hope they let the singing cadets remain as a student activity, even if it has to be divorced from the community department and be still a part of MSC or a part of student activities.

02:14.845 --> 02:18.697
Somehow I think it would destroy them.

02:19.218 --> 02:23.792
I think it would change the whole image, the whole purpose, the whole function.

02:23.941 --> 02:26.804
Now David, on the other hand, doesn't feel that way, I don't think.

02:27.385 --> 02:28.206
He's ambitious.

02:28.306 --> 02:32.991
He wants to be academically accepted, blah, blah, blah.

02:34.513 --> 02:36.074
I never even thought of it that way.

02:36.555 --> 02:47.527
I mean, I was an assistant professor and gave up my position so I could get a raise in student activities.

02:47.707 --> 02:50.370
Because faculty salaries were frozen in those days.

02:53.675 --> 02:55.598
And I think they've got a $20 raise.

03:00.667 --> 03:02.890
Have we left some important topics out?

03:03.752 --> 03:04.493
I don't think so.

03:04.573 --> 03:10.543
I mean, as far as talking about Singulets is concerned, I will look up those three tapes.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.328
I have to locate them.

03:13.368 --> 03:17.775
They're probably stored somewhere.

03:19.325 --> 03:20.566
No, I don't think so.

03:20.626 --> 03:30.195
The four groups that are there now, in my opinion, are all accredited to the university.

03:33.178 --> 03:43.088
Singulets are the oldest, most traditional, and in my opinion, most entertaining.

03:43.868 --> 03:45.670
But that's just my biased opinion.

03:45.953 --> 03:49.599
And have passed now 60 years if they started in 39.

03:50.420 --> 03:51.602
Right, right.

03:52.043 --> 03:58.333
And they got the name in 1940, I think.

03:58.353 --> 03:58.653
Yeah.

03:59.314 --> 04:09.210
All right, then, as we get ready to draw this to a close, let's make believe that someone came to you and gave you a check for a million dollars.

04:09.190 --> 04:10.591
with one condition.

04:11.232 --> 04:17.358
You are to pass it on to Texas A&M, but you can tell A&M what you want done with it.

04:17.438 --> 04:24.344
What would be your favorite, if you had a million dollars you could give, what would be your favorite cause?

04:25.505 --> 04:26.887
What good would you want done?

04:35.375 --> 04:35.535
Uh...

04:41.962 --> 04:45.628
Well I would certainly give money to vocal music, some of it.

04:47.031 --> 04:51.439
Some sort of endowed series of scholarships.

04:55.486 --> 05:04.662
I would give a portion of it to the health center because I think that's going to become more and more important

05:06.245 --> 05:10.739
and more and more a need as our student body keeps growing.

05:11.100 --> 05:18.482
You know when I came here we had 6,000 students.

05:20.892 --> 05:25.057
And I liked it best when it was like 20,000, 25,000.

05:25.498 --> 05:33.147
Of course I always sang at the commencement exercises.

05:34.128 --> 05:39.955
And I used to, years ago, I used to recognize most of the people who crossed the stage.

05:41.176 --> 05:46.663
But I got to the point where I didn't know any who crossed the stage, unless they were singing cadets.

05:47.858 --> 05:49.721
Well, on the money.

05:50.242 --> 06:05.105
I would give some to the computer programs within the library or expand somehow computer access on campus.

06:05.245 --> 06:07.509
I wouldn't know the best way to do that.

06:09.612 --> 06:11.335
Someone smarter than I would do that.

06:17.339 --> 06:31.715
Well, I would try to give the Seeking Cadets the money too to start a high school recruitment program.

06:33.597 --> 06:40.445
You know, these counselors, most of the high school counselors, don't really push A&M that much.

06:41.286 --> 06:46.131
We found out through the years they send them other places.

06:49.182 --> 06:52.226
or recommend other places.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.128
And there will be some way we can overcome that.

06:55.550 --> 06:55.650
Okay.

06:55.670 --> 06:56.852
Alright, last question then.

06:57.452 --> 07:00.677
What feelings do you have for Texas A&M in your heart today?

07:01.057 --> 07:03.600
I think it's the best university in the country.

07:04.742 --> 07:12.051
I think it's, I think it's, it instills more

07:13.246 --> 07:20.653
in the hearts and minds of individual students than any other school in the country that I know of.

07:24.316 --> 07:26.938
And it's good stuff, you know, to me.

07:26.978 --> 07:32.043
It's not just, well I got my degree at such and such.

07:32.564 --> 07:39.630
It's not that, it's like I'm from A&M and I'm an Aggie and I'm proud of it.

07:39.650 --> 07:41.852
And you don't have to say any more than that.

07:43.621 --> 07:44.022
to me.

07:44.042 --> 07:52.876
I found that to be true as we traveled, whether we were talking with Aggies or non-Aggies.

07:54.378 --> 08:08.120
There are some non-Aggies out there, but we always felt, and I think they always felt better after we visited with them.

08:08.140 --> 08:09.021
Let's quit with that.
