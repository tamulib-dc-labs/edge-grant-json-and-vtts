WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:01.780
Okay. At the conclusion of my narrative, with a 
phrase, quote, this officer possesses

00:03.923 --> 00:18.917
outstanding potential to the Army, end quote. And 
I know that that had some

00:20.659 --> 00:29.127
impact on the general officer board that each of 
those gentlemen went to because each one of them

00:30.052 --> 00:41.245
told me after it's all over said they quoted that to 
me and I didn't realize you thought that of me but I

00:30.052 --> 00:41.245
was telling the truth. I was impressed with both 
their capabilities and so expressed it and it was

00:42.206 --> 00:53.859
part of their making general officer anyway. They 
were outstanding and had outstanding

00:54.119 --> 00:59.265
capabilities and If this country, I don't know 
whether it's both active still or not, but if this

00:59.701 --> 01:17.197
country ever goes to war where there'll be top 
flight general officers, I'd be happy to serve

00:59.701 --> 01:17.197
with either one of them, under either one of them. I 
knew them as majors and lieutenant colonels, and

01:17.217 --> 01:27.126
there's where you cut the boys away from the men 
real quick. and both of them were outstanding men

01:27.899 --> 01:31.303
in their jobs. Okay. Now, tell me why you switched 
or how it came about that you switched from the 90th

01:33.385 --> 01:43.717
Infantry Division to the commander, the CO, or the 
401st Field Artillery. No.

01:48.863 --> 01:54.530
Because I moved out of town, and I'll have to find 
the dates on that. I moved out of town, and... Well,

01:57.346 --> 01:58.287
that was back in 54.

02:01.111 --> 02:02.293
So you left the 90th. I left the 90th, and all these 
remarks happened after I went back to the 90th. I

02:09.403 --> 02:13.970
had a lapse there. I moved out of town. That meant I 
could no longer associate on these every Thursday

02:19.334 --> 02:26.944
night or every Sunday drills. Where'd you go? As I 
remember, I went to New Orleans working. I know I

02:34.455 --> 02:37.619
did. I went to New Orleans. Got a job down there, and 
I couldn't participate with them, so the next

02:39.061 --> 02:47.653
thing to do was to put me in a holding group and get me 
out of that active spot. And

02:52.221 --> 03:04.274
I stayed there in the 90, I mean in the 4-1st

02:52.221 --> 03:04.274
group.

03:07.798 --> 03:16.948
And I remember there was a paper shuffle somewhere 
that I got into to artillery corps, corps

03:07.798 --> 03:16.948
artillery.

03:27.070 --> 03:28.272
401st group. I was still in the 401st group. It has 
some dates. I can run this thing.

03:37.884 --> 03:52.403
From 1940...

03:37.884 --> 03:52.403
Chronological speaking again now.

03:55.522 --> 04:20.854
From 1947 to 19...

03:55.522 --> 04:20.854
June 47

03:55.522 --> 04:20.854
to September 48, I was commander of the 4th First 
Field Artillery Group.

04:27.533 --> 04:50.850
And then, in a shuffle of paper designations and 
all, from September of 48 to June of 50, I was

04:27.533 --> 04:50.850
commander of the 33rd Corps Artillery, which is 
again a paper outfit. It was a headquarters,

04:51.371 --> 04:55.077
purely and simply. enlisted people, no equipment 
or anything. And then September 50 is when I joined

04:59.934 --> 05:20.018
the division artillery as the 9th division 
artillery as executive officer and then I stayed

04:59.934 --> 05:20.018
with them until 54.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.942
Well, let me find some orders here. That's what you 
said before. Oh,

05:26.424 --> 05:35.437
I'm running backwards.

05:41.766 --> 05:43.809
Okay. Let me get like this.

05:49.157 --> 05:51.861
53, I was in the group.

05:56.330 --> 05:58.653
September of 53 I was in the group. Which group? 
401st group. Oh, okay, so the 90th Infantry

06:02.537 --> 06:10.787
Division went from 1950 to 1953 then? No.

06:15.332 --> 06:17.315
In 54 I'm in the 401st group. 55

06:17.335 --> 06:25.324
is when I went to the to the 90th Division 
Artillery. As commanded. As commanded, that's

06:31.853 --> 06:33.256
correct. And that's where I assumed command of it 
on 28th of April, 55.

06:45.376 --> 06:51.025
And I commanded it until retired and retired.

07:04.927 --> 07:08.462
And you made general on the 20th of January, 1956. 
I'll tell you that. I'll check that in just a

07:10.471 --> 07:12.118
minute.

07:45.967 --> 08:13.763
I'm looking for an order here, as

07:45.967 --> 08:13.763
I'll have. effective 20th January, 56 is when I 
made general. Here's a telegram from chief of

08:17.092 --> 08:20.116
staff in Washington. Promotion, announcement 
made of your promotion as a reserve commission

08:20.216 --> 08:32.653
officer in the army and greater brigadier general 
was assigned to the army reserve in the United

08:20.216 --> 08:32.653
States effective 20th January, 56. And so that 
was, I was commander of the of the 90th division

08:34.375 --> 08:42.366
artillery at that time and uh And you remained the 
commander until your retirement? Until my

08:45.051 --> 08:46.172
retirement. General Rutter was the division 
commander and he was the one, of course, that

08:46.873 --> 08:58.230
recommended me for the job.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.552
I was promoted as such. What were your feelings 
when you were promoted, Bill? Very, very few

09:04.238 --> 09:08.605
colonels ever become generals. Well, my feelings 
were

09:20.011 --> 09:39.631
I was numb that I had been recommended and would be 
promoted to general and never dreamed of such a

09:20.011 --> 09:39.631
promotion or a recognition.

09:42.834 --> 09:50.001
I was overwhelmed when I realized the 
responsibility of it. I'd been a freelancing

09:50.707 --> 09:57.156
battalion commander, so to speak. And all I had to 
do was look after my 400 and few people and do my job.

10:03.045 --> 10:03.826
And that was fine. I was happy and all. But this 
thing completely took me out of the category of a

10:06.129 --> 10:18.587
small unit commander and gave me a very large unit. 
And the responsibility, it took a month for it to

10:20.120 --> 10:34.622
soak in on me and me realize that it was true that I'd 
been promoted to a BG. And it's something that's

10:35.864 --> 10:42.133
ultimate in professional Army. And I just...

10:47.288 --> 10:50.912
pinch myself, figure out if it's sure enough it's 
me. But then again, I felt it was very

10:52.153 --> 11:03.987
easy to slide in and do the job because I've been 
doing it for so long. It really didn't make any

11:05.308 --> 11:11.555
difference except your... The more 
responsibility and the more recognition you get.

11:18.757 --> 11:33.981
I mean, I could call down to the Fourth Army as a 
colonel and fuss all day on the telephone without

11:18.757 --> 11:33.981
getting an answer, but if I was a brigadier 
general, I got put in right on, ahead of everything

11:18.757 --> 11:33.981
else, and I got an answer, period. You're a 
different, you're a different status in the Army.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.679
You're,

11:53.472 --> 12:01.582
The very weight of what you say bears so much 
influence. As a colonel, you go down to the

12:01.883 --> 12:12.977
officer's club and get tight if you wanted to and 
wheel on home, but you can't do that as a brigadier

12:01.883 --> 12:12.977
general or any general officer. You've got to set 
the pattern, and you've got to demonstrate and

12:12.997 --> 12:17.503
live by it. You can't tell people how to live and not 
live that way yourself. And so it changes your

12:22.868 --> 12:50.985
perspective and

12:22.868 --> 12:50.985
I

12:22.868 --> 12:50.985
kept about my business and

12:22.868 --> 12:50.985
assured General Rutter that he'd be proud of his 
division artillery and

12:22.868 --> 12:50.985
that's when I set my goals of setting up this combat 
proficiency test to as a goal for each of my

12:52.450 --> 12:54.472
battalions. And they knew it. I told them way ahead 
of time, before I ever announced it, to give them

12:56.294 --> 13:02.300
time to react to it. And frankly, if they didn't 
want to do it, well, I'd get another commander.

13:07.085 --> 13:10.008
Because that's what I had as my goal. And I knew 
that, in all probability, I'd be retiring in 1962

13:11.149 --> 13:16.615
at the end of my 30 years. And that's what I wanted to 
do. And I set about doing it. We,

13:23.011 --> 13:34.843
that combat proficiency test is set out on the 
regulations and it's standard. It's like

13:34.943 --> 13:42.671
passing one of your history courses in college.

13:46.355 --> 13:48.377
You prepare for it, you work after it, and you've 
got to train every soldier in his job and he has to be

13:49.167 --> 13:54.792
proficient or the thing will break down. And like I 
say, the second year we did it, Colonel Kokonos and

13:56.794 --> 14:17.875
Colonel Butler's battalions passed it, the third 
year, and I think it was, it was, uh, uh, Carnegie's

13:56.794 --> 14:17.875
battalion out of San Antonio in the fourth year, it 
was, uh, Saget's battalion there in Austin passed

13:56.794 --> 14:17.875
it. That's the way I remember it. So of course, 
after one's passed it, it's easy for them to pass

14:21.246 --> 14:25.252
it. And so there again, the Kokonos passed it three 
years, and Butler three years, and the third one

14:26.214 --> 14:39.814
two years, and one year, which qualified that 
division artillery to go in combat immediately.

14:40.856 --> 14:45.583
And that's the ultimate of the reserve program is 
to prepare The enlisted reserves are the reserves

14:46.542 --> 15:02.852
to take over the responsibilities of the active 
army and to join with the active army and as far as I

14:46.542 --> 15:02.852
was concerned, to be as good as active army or 
better. Which brings us to another point. In 1950,

15:05.617 --> 15:09.664
the United States went to war against North Korea. 
and you were not called back in. There were very few

15:12.972 --> 15:15.537
reservists that were called back in. What were 
your feelings toward that? That's their

15:17.761 --> 15:19.725
business. If they needed a 9th Divardy, they'd 
call us and they didn't need us. Did you want to go or

15:24.255 --> 15:27.661
did you have any pro or con feelings? I had no 
brothers one way or the other about it.

15:37.927 --> 15:38.828
I was prepared. My battalion, my divarty was 
prepared. And the decision on what units went and

15:42.212 --> 15:48.880
what units didn't go was made in Army 
headquarters. Had they wanted to call the 9th

15:50.582 --> 15:56.929
Divarty and General Elder would have called me, 
I'd have said, yes, sir, we're ready. Or I'd have

15:58.491 --> 16:02.175
said, we'll be ready in 30 days or 60 days or 
something. But I could have said, we're ready.

16:08.791 --> 16:11.755
The Army didn't dip into the reserves that deep. 
They took some National Guard units, but they

16:12.415 --> 16:17.942
didn't take any reserve units as such. Okay. Now 
during the time that you were the commanding

16:19.164 --> 16:27.915
general, you must have had more blacks and women 
join the reserves, did you? Or could you tell me,

16:28.115 --> 16:35.925
could you address those two topics, blacks and 
women in the reserve, and give me your feelings on

16:28.115 --> 16:35.925
that? I think it... My feelings are that getting 
back beyond the minority business, I think that we

16:37.563 --> 16:48.413
ought to have universal military service, 
period. Truman's idea. I don't know. Certainly my

16:52.176 --> 17:04.768
idea, that we ought to have universal military 
training, and every youngster coming along

16:52.176 --> 17:04.768
should do two years, 18 months, one year, 
whatever, the powers that be think would be an

17:05.626 --> 17:10.172
adequate time to train him or her. Women included? 
Women included. I don't believe in women in a

17:14.237 --> 17:24.230
combat role, but there are supportive roles that 
they can do immensely well.

17:26.813 --> 17:33.102
One time in combat, for instance, I had this 
infallibly driven home. My wife wrote to me every

17:33.682 --> 17:34.924
day. My mother wrote to me once or twice a week. And 
one time I didn't get the letters for two months.

17:44.192 --> 17:50.139
And I figured that something damn bold got sunk or 
something, you know, I didn't pay attention to it,

17:44.192 --> 17:50.139
except I was busy. But I did miss my letters from my 
wife and my mother. General Patton was down in some

17:55.405 --> 18:03.915
outfit, one of his Third Army outfits, talking 
with some of the soldiers, and the old man would do

17:55.405 --> 18:03.915
that frequently. He'd get in a mess line with them 
and just discuss problems, how they're getting

18:04.554 --> 18:19.189
along, they're getting, are the officers taking 
care of you, you get plenty of food, you're getting

18:04.554 --> 18:19.189
a can of beer down the end, you're getting a little 
mail. No, sir, General, I haven't had any mail in

18:19.309 --> 18:24.794
three weeks or five or six weeks. And it panned out 
most of his answers were he hadn't, they hadn't had

18:24.814 --> 18:29.259
any mail in six or eight weeks. Well, General 
Patton was of the the capabilities and the

18:32.515 --> 18:44.368
seniority that he went to Paris, where the Comzee 
communication zone headquarters is, was. And he

18:46.371 --> 18:51.596
went in and asked about the mail, and of course they 
couldn't give him an answer. The APO mail was all

18:53.459 --> 18:57.443
being flown out to Orly Field. And he found that out 
somehow. And he went out there, and my God, there

19:01.549 --> 19:08.255
were hangar after hangar stacked full to the 
ceiling of mail that hadn't been handled.

19:10.877 --> 19:18.584
And he got to digging into it as a very senior 
three-star general. And this shows the swife that

19:18.604 --> 19:22.228
one of those people could take. He found out that 
there were two battalions of black wax assigned to

19:28.810 --> 19:34.376
handling mail. And instead of sorting and 
shipping the mail out to the units, they were

19:34.396 --> 19:41.723
playing around, crowding around all night and 
sleeping all day. General Patton, when he found

19:43.465 --> 19:47.388
that out, he went and saw it himself. He went to 
Comzee Commander and relieved him, two-star

19:47.789 --> 19:50.632
general. Sent him home as lieutenant colonel. He 
sent home two brigadier generals. as lieutenant

19:58.055 --> 20:01.861
colonels and it absolutely devastated their 
careers. He moved those people out of there and

20:03.604 --> 20:05.808
sent them home. Got a bunch of his tankers that were 
on rest somewhere and up there and started to bail

20:07.911 --> 20:17.006
out and I remember I got 58 letters at one time. Gee 
whiz. These other generals just didn't know this

20:19.830 --> 20:22.314
was going on? Didn't know it was going on and they 
didn't get out of their office downtown or their

20:25.274 --> 20:29.579
officer's club or something to go see about it. But 
General Patton- Have they heard any complaints?

20:32.764 --> 20:36.108
Well, the complaints hadn't gotten to them, I 
guess. Let's just say it that way. Because the

20:38.110 --> 20:42.396
general officer should have, he should have 
picked it up first place. In the second place, it

20:42.416 --> 20:48.003
shouldn't have ever happened. But they just 
weren't doing their job. And General Patton, when

20:51.278 --> 20:57.245
he picked it up out in his mess line somewhere, that 
soldier hadn't gotten any letters for six or eight

20:51.278 --> 20:57.245
weeks. Well, he went to see why. And because of his 
tenacity and because of his seniority, he had the

20:58.486 --> 21:07.536
rank to do it. And he did it. So

21:11.141 --> 21:19.530
that was a good place to put female soldiers, 
starting male out. because there's no combat

21:20.168 --> 21:22.591
exposure there. There's no rigid duty and it has to 
be done. It took, General Pattinson sent some of

21:27.636 --> 21:32.382
his two, three battalions of his tankers back 
there. Left his tanks under guards wherever they

21:33.823 --> 21:38.248
were, sent them back there and they did it in a 
couple weeks. Broke the backlog down and got it

21:39.830 --> 21:42.133
operating. But that was a good place to put female 
soldiers. Now you get some screams about they're

21:46.478 --> 21:48.640
not doing soldier work and all but took soldiers to 
do the job and they did relieve able-bodied men

21:49.092 --> 22:15.218
soldiers to do the fighting uh I don't know what 
percent I'm sure 20 or 25 percent of the army is is

21:49.092 --> 22:15.218
overhead army around headquarters particularly 
and I know you saw a a male able-bodied male that

22:15.755 --> 22:19.501
could do combat being an air packing typewriter. 
So female soldiers have a very definite place in

22:21.364 --> 22:25.570
the Army. I wouldn't say combat because they're 
not equipped for combat. They don't have the

22:31.560 --> 22:43.078
physical capabilities for combat, but they do 
have physical capabilities doing office work,

22:31.560 --> 22:43.078
which is necessary, the administrative work, and 
handling the mail, for instance. Okay, in the late

22:43.531 --> 22:59.789
1940s and throughout the war in Korea, President 
Truman integrated the army units and before this

22:43.531 --> 22:59.789
time of course we had black units, we had white 
units, and then he integrated this must have had

22:43.531 --> 22:59.789
some effect on the reserves. Could you talk about 
that? It had effect on reserves in that

23:01.811 --> 23:12.002
there was a transition period. didn't bother me 
because my philosophy is red, yellow, black, or

23:12.286 --> 23:18.794
white, they're precious in his sight. Jesus loves 
the little children of the world. There was a

23:20.857 --> 23:27.024
Sunday school song that I learned 65 years ago. 
Those words in it, and I can't ever remember

23:27.084 --> 23:31.890
violating it.

23:36.216 --> 23:37.437
There was some resentment. Surely there was some 
resentment. But some of the white boys and the

23:39.370 --> 23:43.816
black soldiers coming in. On

23:44.817 --> 24:00.338
the other hand, the black soldiers that came in to 
me, I warned and made my people treat them as

23:44.817 --> 24:00.338
equals. And I say made in that I busted one sergeant 
because he didn't do it. And that word gets around

24:06.185 --> 24:08.348
fast. On the other hand... One sergeant in a 
reserve unit? A white sergeant in a reserve unit.

24:14.973 --> 24:20.980
On the other hand,

24:14.973 --> 24:20.980
those were signs of times. The transition had to be 
made. It was by executive order. And those, as far

24:25.886 --> 24:34.777
as I was concerned, that was Army regulations, 
which means law, and that was it. And we turned out

24:34.797 --> 24:38.301
some mighty good black enlisted people, and I have 
served with some high-quality black officers.

24:47.293 --> 25:05.032
There's no

24:47.293 --> 25:05.032
room for dissent

24:47.293 --> 25:05.032
on that subject, and those that fight that problem 
are just, they should know they're fighting a

24:47.293 --> 25:05.032
losing battle. Yeah, okay. That's not the 
American philosophy. They could as well say

25:10.315 --> 25:18.066
they're against German heritage people or Polish 
heritage people or Italian heritage people or

25:10.315 --> 25:18.066
African heritage people. They're all the same to 
me. And if a man will present himself as a soldier,

25:20.109 --> 25:26.698
do his job, why? Red, yellow, black, or white, I 
don't care. Now were there any, except for this

25:30.604 --> 25:35.811
sergeant, when you were the commander, Except for 
this one sergeant that you had to ever leave, were

25:36.162 --> 25:40.047
there any problems besides that? Any little riots 
or anything? No, no, no, no, no, no. I never saw any

25:43.030 --> 25:46.254
real problems at all. And his was passive. His was 
passive. I busted him because he wasn't doing his

25:51.000 --> 25:55.045
job of training that man, period. And whether that 
man's black, white, red or yellow, I didn't care.

25:59.650 --> 26:01.713
But he wasn't doing his job of training that man. 
And I didn't bust him for...

26:07.027 --> 26:10.852
not integrating with the man. I bust him for not 
doing his job. Okay. Now, when you think back on

26:14.036 --> 26:32.901
your military career, going all the way up to 
general, did you leave, I like your opinion of

26:14.036 --> 26:32.901
this, did you leave your advancement to fate or to 
luck or something or to your superiors, or did you

26:14.036 --> 26:32.901
think that you yourself had some control over your 
promotions? The only control I had ever had,

26:36.288 --> 26:40.453
Terry, is doing my job. A long time ago, and I told 
you this story initially of how an army just saying

26:40.473 --> 26:50.244
never hurry, never worry, never volunteer for 
nothing. That is to some degree true. The

26:55.430 --> 26:58.034
volunteer part is the true part. The other is not 
true. I told you the story of my friend that got out

27:00.156 --> 27:05.282
of Leavenworth the same time I did. swapped my name 
for his on an order going to Portugal and he is lost

27:05.768 --> 27:13.720
because of that and I'm here today. I never once 
asked for a job and I never once asked to get out of a

27:15.002 --> 27:20.590
job. When I was given a job, I energetically and 
tried enthusiastically to do that job and If you do

27:31.992 --> 27:38.719
that, your superiors can't help but recognize it, 
and time comes for them to make a recommendation

27:31.992 --> 27:38.719
for promotion. They could recommend somebody 
that did that job. So it seems to me like you left,

27:42.002 --> 27:50.991
and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it 
seems to me that you left your advancement to your

27:42.002 --> 27:50.991
superiors. Without a doubt. Every move I made, I 
never asked to be transferred to any

27:51.872 --> 27:56.397
organization. I certainly never asked to be 
promoted. Well, most people who reach the

28:00.867 --> 28:11.697
pinnacle of the military or any organization,

28:00.867 --> 28:11.697
many would say that these people are ambitious. 
Would you consider yourself ambitious?

28:15.820 --> 28:24.708
Ambitious only to the sense that I was obsessed 
with doing my job in an excellent manner. The Army

28:25.288 --> 28:27.430
terminology is superior. You

28:27.865 --> 28:38.516
think of excellence as being the pinnacle in your 
teaching profession and college careers and all

28:27.865 --> 28:38.516
this kind of business. Well, in the Army, you have 
five categories, superior, excellent, very

28:38.536 --> 28:50.248
satisfactory, satisfactory, and 
unsatisfactory. So my goal, and I energetically

28:51.309 --> 28:57.636
pursued it, of being superior, doing the best job 
possible. And I've reiterated a half dozen

29:02.544 --> 29:14.761
instances where my work was recognized and I 
profited by it. I could see this, that you do your

29:15.282 --> 29:20.970
job or you'll be recognized. Okay, is that the same 
idea that you have toward being an engineer?

29:24.835 --> 29:26.678
That's right. What about this idea? Here's 
another idea I'd like you to answer or address

29:28.341 --> 29:35.018
yourself to. You're not only a success as far as the 
military, but you're a leader, a former owner of

29:36.361 --> 29:43.519
your own company. Do you think that getting ahead 
in the military, how people get ahead, how people

29:43.668 --> 29:55.180
get promoted in the military, is similar or 
different than how they do that in the business

29:43.668 --> 29:55.180
world? I think it's very similar in that if you do 
your job, your superiors are going to recognize

29:55.621 --> 29:59.985
you. And if they gave you more responsibility, 
you're carrying more load, it means they will

30:00.886 --> 30:10.837
promote you up to a higher echelon of supervision. 
Well, that means more pay. And after every one, I

30:13.317 --> 30:15.480
was looking for more pay. I carried that 
philosophy every day in my business. And I

30:22.090 --> 30:30.983
commended and rewarded the job superintendents 
that were making money. And that means running a

30:31.103 --> 30:34.448
good job, doing their job. They're doing their job 
better than the rest of them. And that's reading.

30:41.752 --> 30:47.741
Two of them made top wages, and one of them made 
mediocre wage, I mean average wage, and two of them

30:41.752 --> 30:47.741
made subpar wages. Purely and simply, 
recognition of their capabilities. I treated

30:53.589 --> 30:57.114
them all alike, but when it comes to the paychecks, 
it was a different story. Because one of them was

30:58.376 --> 31:05.867
making more money for me, meaning I could pay him 
more money. And that man, he was excelling. He was

31:09.171 --> 31:10.273
doing a superior job. and the others were doing 
average jobs. Let's talk for a few minutes about

31:14.008 --> 31:17.052
leadership. We've touched on this throughout 
these interviews, but we have never defined it so

31:17.513 --> 31:23.440
far. Would you give me your definition of 
leadership? Leadership. I think that's the

31:28.727 --> 31:37.999
demonstrated quality of getting the job done by 
virtue of other people doing it for you. you've got

31:40.409 --> 31:45.475
to give them the leadership to get them to 
accomplish their job. It's nothing more than the

31:47.157 --> 31:52.943
bag of carrots out in front of the mule. And if you 
can keep that mule pulling, why, you're gonna get

31:54.846 --> 32:01.453
your job done. To me, leadership is having the 
confidence in yourself that you can do that job. If

32:14.850 --> 32:35.453
you're equipped with the technical knowledge and 
you can demonstrate the

32:14.850 --> 32:35.453
practical application of your technical 
knowledge with your confidence and exuberance

32:14.850 --> 32:35.453
over it, you can portray it ultimately to the 
fellas doing the work. And you've got to work

32:37.276 --> 32:39.458
through chains of command. You can't be riding 
herd over every man. In the Ninth Divardy, I

32:44.537 --> 32:49.142
changed commanders a lot. Purely and simply, 
weeding out the mediocre, the average, or the

32:49.903 --> 32:58.612
excellent ones to get superior ones. And I think my 
judgment was borne out by General Kokonos and

32:59.713 --> 33:07.521
General Butler as two of the four.

33:10.640 --> 33:14.505
I think it... Well, what type of values should a 
leader have? You mentioned values. You mentioned

33:17.468 --> 33:18.249
one. You said self-confidence. What other values 
should a leader have? Well, he's got to be

33:21.713 --> 33:23.596
technically capable. Sure. He's got to know what 
he's doing. Absolutely. And he's got to be right.

33:28.762 --> 33:31.245
And above all, he's got to be honest. He's got to be 
honest and not try to hoodwink anybody and he's got

33:38.872 --> 33:42.716
to be the first man to say, I got, I was wrong on that 
one. Let's don't let that happen again. It doesn't

33:45.058 --> 33:47.000
uh- So he can admit mistakes. Huh? So he can admit 
mistakes. You bet. He's got to admit a mistake. Uh,

33:52.365 --> 34:01.214
the, the uh, proof of the pudding is don't make 
them, but if you ever make one, be the first to admit

33:52.365 --> 34:01.214
it before anybody else finds it out. And uh, all you 
can do is just say, I gotta stump my toe on that and

34:05.686 --> 34:08.430
let's don't do that no more. Then is the leader 
flexible? I think he is. He makes up his mind to do a

34:12.736 --> 34:18.304
certain thing at a certain time by all the 
information he has at that time. And that's the

34:18.985 --> 34:21.949
correct decision to make. And come back a week 
later and the changes of information can change

34:22.951 --> 34:29.640
his decision. He has to be flexible. If something 
doesn't work, you gotta approach it from another

34:33.091 --> 34:47.712
angle to get around to wherever you want to go and 
the decision made today doesn't necessarily hold

34:33.091 --> 34:47.712
a week from today because the situation's 
changed. What about tolerance? You mentioned how

34:49.575 --> 34:56.044
Patton just fired these people, demoted other 
people, sent them back. Would you think that

34:56.598 --> 34:58.441
Batten was a great leader? I think you've said that 
during these interviews. I think he's an

35:01.105 --> 35:02.607
outstanding leader. One of the superior leaders 
in the Army. All

35:06.373 --> 35:14.445
he did was get the commendation of every man that 
hadn't gotten letters in six or eight weeks. The

35:16.949 --> 35:25.322
proof of the pudding is that General Eisenhower 
and ultimately the Secretary of War in those days

35:16.949 --> 35:25.322
upheld it. and never questioned it. And those 
gentlemen have veto power over anything you do.

35:35.083 --> 35:43.635
Me moving from A to B, if it hadn't been 
satisfactory all the way up the line, they could

35:35.083 --> 35:43.635
have jerked my ass and sent me home quick. I'll tell 
you one experience I had with this. What I mean by

35:47.921 --> 35:51.025
it, it was a dear experience to me. We were in an a 
little German town named Schmid. Just after we

35:58.143 --> 36:14.808
went into Germany, there was a bombed out church, 
typical Catholic church, where the apse or the

35:58.143 --> 36:14.808
sanctuary is long and then the rectory up here and 
the pope and all up here. And the whole back end,

36:16.450 --> 36:18.613
meaning the apps of the pulpit, the cross and all 
were blown out, bombed out, artillery got here or

36:19.420 --> 36:26.249
something, I don't know. Anyway, the pews were in 
the back of the church were dusty and full of snow,

36:26.269 --> 36:34.040
but still usable. And the army had a system where 
they had one chaplain that would have four or five

36:36.323 --> 36:47.939
battalions to work in an area. They may have had 10 
battalions in this area, and they had a

36:49.120 --> 36:56.830
Protestant, a Catholic, and maybe a Jew rabbi. And 
they worked around in these areas. And they would

36:59.734 --> 37:08.185
come by or send their helper down and say, well, the 
chaplain wants to come by Sunday morning at 7

36:59.734 --> 37:08.185
o'clock, have church. And how about getting us a 
place to have church? OK. and you found a place to

37:14.821 --> 37:27.276
have church and you set the thing up and you put the 
word out to the area units next to you on either side

37:14.821 --> 37:27.276
and we could have church at such and such a 
crossroads and you come bring your boys down. Any

37:28.157 --> 37:31.461
of them want to go to church, they can. Well,

37:31.481 --> 37:42.094
our group had a Catholic chaplain who was head of 
the Jesuit school up here in Denver.

37:45.196 --> 37:47.860
Joe something, I forget his name. He was an 
educator.

37:51.705 --> 37:53.307
And he's a good fella. He loved, he played poker 
with us and he drank a little nip with us now and

37:53.688 --> 37:59.496
then, you know, in the evening. And

38:00.678 --> 38:07.187
I'm sure he was a devout Catholic.

38:10.171 --> 38:16.557
Anyway, this Baptist preacher sent word to me that 
he could hold service in our area at 7 o'clock, and

38:10.171 --> 38:16.557
me find him a place. Well, I looked around, and the 
little old town's caput, except the back end of

38:16.597 --> 38:21.201
this church. And the pews were still there, 
intact. And I told my communications sergeant to,

38:25.806 --> 38:34.254
once they get the wire in, all they got to do is keep 
it in, and that's a relatively minor chore. So they

38:34.514 --> 38:35.675
got time on their hands. I said, sergeant, take 
care. spare people down to the church and sweep all

38:40.765 --> 38:50.233
the snow off and get the debris off of eight or ten of 
those pews back here in the back end so we can have

38:40.765 --> 38:50.233
church down there Sunday. And this was maybe 
Wednesday or Thursday, I don't know. And he said,

38:56.239 --> 38:57.460
all right, and he did. Well, this Catholic chapter 
helped me either supper, I mean, supper Thursday

38:59.161 --> 39:06.768
night or breakfast Friday morning. What you could 
do down there at the church, I'm going to have

39:10.516 --> 39:11.537
church service. But you can't do that. I said, oh, 
what are you talking about, Chaplain? That's a

39:19.284 --> 39:28.893
church house, and

39:19.284 --> 39:28.893
Chaplain Jones is coming down here Sunday morning 
at 7 o'clock to have church. So he told me to have a

39:28.953 --> 39:31.815
place, and that's where we're going to have it. You 
can't do that. I said, oh, get off and back now.

39:36.860 --> 39:37.561
What's the problem? He said, well, that's 
sanctified property. And I'm not a Catholic. I am a

39:45.057 --> 39:49.021
Christian, and I don't draw the line between them. 
We all try and get the same heaven. And I said, oh,

39:51.063 --> 39:56.128
hell, you just sit on over there on that peach tree 
and watch me. I'm busy. I got busy with something to

39:57.129 --> 39:58.811
get away from him. But the point is, he went to the 
army chaplain, who was another Catholic, and the

39:59.852 --> 40:09.582
army chaplain sent word i couldn't do that and i 
sent word back to him right down come down and

40:10.591 --> 40:39.248
breakfast at six o'clock and we go to church seven 
o'clock come come worship with us you know i was

40:10.591 --> 40:39.248
kind but i was completely telling him go to hell and

40:10.591 --> 40:39.248
he went back of course he blew up like a toad frog 
poison toad frog he went back and wrote an order by

40:41.000 --> 40:45.848
command of General Simpson, the Army commander, 
that I would not do it. Now, somehow, I got the

40:47.570 --> 40:52.378
premonition that SOB would do this. And I hadn't 
gotten it by the time I went to bed Saturday night.

40:57.606 --> 41:01.192
And I told my message center that I did not want to be 
disturbed. And any messages came to me before 7

41:01.212 --> 41:04.577
o'clock in the morning to hold them. a message 
center is where any incoming messages go in and are

41:06.008 --> 41:35.948
tallied in by time and signature just like a 
registered mail is in our post office and so sure

41:06.008 --> 41:35.948
enough it came in after after i went to bed i don't 
know what time 11 12 o'clock at night came in my

41:06.008 --> 41:35.948
message center chief just sat on it and he gave it to 
me after church sunday morning and touted it to me

41:06.008 --> 41:35.948
at church yeah i mean he wrote it all out so It would 
have stood up. And of course, it had already been

41:38.861 --> 41:42.745
done. And my chaplain wouldn't, that chaplain in 
our group wouldn't speak to me for a month after

41:44.086 --> 41:50.353
that. But what I'm getting down to

41:50.373 --> 41:56.420
is can they do it? About a week later, General 
Simpson, who was 9th Army Commander, came down in

41:57.841 --> 42:03.587
my area. And I had my people keyed. defensively for 
me, when any general officer came in the area,

42:06.016 --> 42:09.700
they'd get hold of me. So I could go down there and 
report to him, introduce yourself to him if you

42:10.461 --> 42:23.656
didn't know him, ask him if you could be of any help 
to him in service, invite him to have a cup of coffee

42:10.461 --> 42:23.656
or something, you know. Greet him in the area, see 
what he's looking for, and of course,

42:25.979 --> 42:32.666
defensively, I was interested in what the hell he 
was doing down there. So I could protect myself or

42:34.450 --> 42:36.233
the battalion. And he came in the area and he saw a 
mess line. He timed his time to arrive here so he

42:40.960 --> 42:44.765
could get in this mess line. That's where those 
people would go to find information at. So he stood

42:48.912 --> 42:50.394
in the enlisted mess line? So he got in the enlisted 
mess line. He borrowed a canteen and a mess kit from

42:52.016 --> 43:01.791
a soldier and went through and got his meal and went 
up and sat down on the rock and talked with the

42:52.016 --> 43:01.791
soldiers. And of course, when I saw what was 
happening, I reported to him while they were still

43:02.260 --> 43:07.906
in this line. He said, now, kiddo, I appreciate you 
coming down. And you're a busy man, I know. So you go

43:14.773 --> 43:15.794
on about your business. I just want to get a meal 
here. And I said, come on up to the office and

43:18.717 --> 43:20.359
message them. No, I'd rather have a meal down here. 
And I knew what Teddy was doing, but I didn't know

43:22.001 --> 43:24.063
why. So I just faded out of the picture. But I put my 
trusted communications sergeant right behind

43:31.403 --> 43:37.250
him so he could gather all this information for me.

43:38.832 --> 43:40.273
So I would know what was going on. He asked them 
questions about their mail, about their food,

43:42.856 --> 43:59.976
about how I was taking care of them as far as 
medicine was concerned, were their PX rations

43:42.856 --> 43:59.976
adequate, and all the things that soldiers have 
close to their heart. and of course I got a positive

44:00.395 --> 44:17.693
answer, affirmative answer on every one of them 
and when he left he sent his aide for me

44:00.395 --> 44:17.693
and thank him very much for his courtesy, extended 
and for the fine meal that he had. He was glad to see

44:17.713 --> 44:20.356
that my soldiers were eating so well. He

44:20.396 --> 44:29.085
liked the looks of my battalion and Keep up the good 
work and left. Well, this is a four-star general.

44:33.696 --> 44:46.314
My communications sergeant told me after it all 
over what questions he asked and all, like about

44:33.696 --> 44:46.314
your mail and your PX supplies and where you're 
comfortably housed and how the rain and all that

44:33.696 --> 44:46.314
kind of thing. And I dare say it was all a reflection 
of this chaplain business and having Christian

44:46.935 --> 44:56.409
church in the back end of this Catholic church and 
offended the Catholic chaplain. And they

44:57.450 --> 44:59.393
reported me to him. And General Simpson came down 
to find out, just like General Patton did. Sure.

45:05.442 --> 45:13.132
And I got affirmative reports on every category, 
so all he could do was say, you got a good battalion,

45:05.442 --> 45:13.132
keep up the good work, boy. But if one of those 
soldiers had cracked a damn foot of slop, or, no, I

45:13.152 --> 45:28.633
haven't gotten any mail, or we're not getting none 
of the cigarettes or something like that, well,

45:13.152 --> 45:28.633
old Kidwell would have been gone home as a captain 
and still be a captain. But I got the other report.

45:30.760 --> 45:32.222
And so I... So leadership, then, has a heck of a lot 
to do with satisfying the needs of your men.

45:37.469 --> 45:37.889
Absolutely. Everything. Because if the men 
aren't happy, they won't do their job. Right. If

45:44.158 --> 45:49.385
you keep a man satisfied and he can see himself 
accomplishing something, he'll do it. And that's

45:51.067 --> 45:51.928
leadership. That's leadership to me. Okay, let's 
say that, General, they called you and asked you to

45:54.291 --> 46:00.379
come to A&M and said... Talk to these young 
19-year-old corpsmen here and tell them how to

46:00.511 --> 46:04.475
become a leader. How would you respond to that?

46:15.087 --> 46:16.348
You've got to know your job. And you have to have the 
capabilities of portraying that knowledge to

46:17.609 --> 46:22.174
your men. And whether leadership is a God-given 
right or whether it's developed or whether it's

46:28.523 --> 46:30.706
accidental. Educators and psychologists will 
have to determine that. I don't know. Probably a

46:36.695 --> 46:38.017
blend of all of it. I think some people are more born 
leaders than others. Then again, if a man has the

46:46.851 --> 46:51.217
desire, he can equip himself to do the job. And by 
demonstration, he can excel the others. And

46:56.890 --> 46:59.476
that's where the cream rises to the top. If a man 
wants to do his job, he can do it. But he's got to know

47:06.231 --> 47:08.557
his job first. And he's got to be able to portray 
that knowledge to his other people.
