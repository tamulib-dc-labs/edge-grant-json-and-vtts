WEBVTT

00:01.364 --> 00:17.336
And so, here we were, in the middle of the 60s, with the hunger, famine, problems in Pakistan and Inka.

00:17.356 --> 00:20.723
And by then we had had several years of testing on farms.

00:21.007 --> 00:36.342
The first year we brought in 350 tons of improved varieties, together with the management that we have learned how to fertilize on the different Pakistani soils, 300 tons into India.

00:36.362 --> 00:40.546
Despite the war between the two countries, everything went wrong.

00:40.566 --> 00:45.310
And I think that's in the record of all the problems.

00:45.330 --> 00:49.174
By 67, 68, you could see things were happening.

00:50.099 --> 01:15.103
Then it was a question of pushing the political leaders to get the right support from the standpoint of importations of fertilizer, credit for the little farmer to buy it, and the price announced before planting so that the government would buy anything offered at that pre-announced price, which would reflect the international market price.

01:15.603 --> 01:17.625
And that's how these organizations developed then?

01:17.892 --> 01:21.117
And so this started taking off.

01:21.157 --> 01:34.476
By 68, no one except Paddock and Ehrlich and some of these were saying it was still favorable weather that had changed.

01:34.697 --> 01:36.560
It wasn't technology.

01:37.881 --> 01:39.624
By 69, it repeated.

01:41.006 --> 01:47.055
By 69, there was euphoria in both countries, Pakistan, India.

01:47.288 --> 01:51.853
Pakistan really became self-sufficient essentially in 68, India.

01:52.313 --> 01:58.339
And then Pakistan went back because of internal strife, political upheavals.

01:58.559 --> 02:05.086
But it didn't go back as much as one would have expected with all the chaos.

02:05.106 --> 02:07.328
Whereas India kept moving.

02:07.348 --> 02:10.611
And so the Peace Prize was awarded.

02:10.632 --> 02:16.097
And I remember when I came back from Maslow at a press conference in New York.

02:17.056 --> 02:26.808
that was sponsored jointly by Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, USAID.

02:26.828 --> 02:34.276
And present, as I recall, representing those people, or those organizations, was Dr. J.G.

02:34.296 --> 02:34.797
Herrard, Dr. F.F.

02:34.817 --> 02:45.730
Hill of the Ford Foundation, and Dr. John Hanna, who was then the ex-president of Michigan State University, but was then the head of USAID.

02:46.047 --> 02:58.585
And each of them spoke at this press conference about what this meant, this so-called Green Revolution had captured it, become a cliché.

02:59.486 --> 03:01.409
We had nothing to do with it.

03:01.429 --> 03:12.645
The origin of this term went back to the report, I'm not sure if it was 1967 or 68, I believe 1968, of the

03:13.452 --> 03:17.101
then director of USAID, William Dowd.

03:17.662 --> 03:25.200
When I talked about John Hanna being the director, he had been director of USAID.

03:26.159 --> 03:35.108
And he had used the term in describing the sudden increase in wheat production in Pakistan and India.

03:35.128 --> 03:40.093
It seemed like a green revolution was starting.

03:40.573 --> 03:50.163
And he said something seems to be happening with rice in the same way in the Philippines.

03:50.183 --> 03:52.285
And it now looks like it might be starting to happen in Pakistan.

03:53.699 --> 03:57.666
So a Green Revolution is starting, and this became the cliché.

03:57.686 --> 04:01.793
We never had anything to do with it.

04:01.813 --> 04:09.307
So at this press conference, each of these three people spoke with N.I.

04:09.327 --> 04:11.050
and spoke with great fame.

04:11.070 --> 04:11.691
By then I was pretty confident.

04:11.941 --> 04:25.887
what was going to happen, even in a place like India.

04:25.907 --> 04:27.691
We had similar programs going well in Turkey by then and a number of other countries.

04:27.711 --> 04:28.913
Argentina was moving along very well.

04:28.933 --> 04:30.456
Of course, it was never under duress from the standpoint of food shortage,

04:30.993 --> 04:54.800
My interest in working there was that looking at the world food situation, I figured that it would be an exporter to other parts of Latin America, especially that would be food shortage by this time, 1985 or 1990.

04:54.820 --> 04:57.523
After these three distinguished people had spoken, I spoke briefly,

04:58.263 --> 05:14.888
how this had evolved in maybe 10 minutes or 15 minutes.

05:14.908 --> 05:16.390
And, of course, these other three people had given their insights into it.

05:16.410 --> 05:17.091
And it was opened up to questions.

05:17.111 --> 05:18.533
And this was, it was a pretty big pressure meeting at the time of life.

05:19.103 --> 05:41.797
The first question I got was, well, how much is, I don't remember the exact wordage, but the essence was, how much is this bone-dogling cost the American taxpayers, either directly or indirectly, by way of these foundations in the USAID?

05:41.817 --> 05:43.980
And I said, well, the budget

05:45.563 --> 06:05.698
For the Rice Institute, for Semen, and for the two that are now building, Zia in Colombia and Iita in Nigeria, last year was the equivalent of three Phantom Jet fighters.

06:08.024 --> 06:09.646
That was the end of that.

06:09.747 --> 06:12.991
Then it was just like I couldn't do any wrong.

06:13.192 --> 06:21.364
And then there was a lot of other questions, but none of them of that kind.

06:21.384 --> 06:32.901
And by the next September, the World Bank called a meeting in Washington, D.C.

06:33.640 --> 06:40.287
with the proposal to set up the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research.

06:42.429 --> 06:51.638
And all organizations, governments, institutions that were interested were invited to attend.

06:54.001 --> 06:55.082
I don't remember how many was there, I talked briefly.

06:55.102 --> 06:58.165
But mostly the directors of the institute.

06:58.345 --> 06:59.226
And this is 1971 now?

06:59.459 --> 07:05.588
This was 1971, probably in September.

07:07.370 --> 07:26.277
And there, the directors, Chandler from the Rice Institute, Wellhausen from Sima, I guess Grant was, yeah, Grant from Seattle, Columbia, and who was that?

07:28.417 --> 07:32.483
IITA wasn't operating yet, but was being built.

07:32.503 --> 07:43.500
Whoever the acting director was, they all spoke, giving a description of their budgets, the projects they had, and so on.

07:43.520 --> 07:49.068
In the end, they decided to form this consultant group in international agriculture.

07:49.088 --> 07:53.074
The secretariat was placed in the World Bank.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.392
with Mother's support at that time from them.

07:58.613 --> 08:02.719
There was quite a sizable... Well, first of all... Well, what was the aim?

08:02.759 --> 08:05.483
I mean... ...to pool the resources.

08:05.743 --> 08:06.884
Okay, that's what I thought.

08:07.125 --> 08:16.097
To pool the resources to support not only the research institutes that were then either operating, there were only two operating.

08:16.117 --> 08:16.217
Yeah.

08:16.237 --> 08:18.640
The Rice Institute, similar.

08:19.622 --> 08:20.503
And two of building.

08:21.224 --> 08:21.364
Mm-hmm.

08:21.384 --> 08:22.926
Sea optical...

08:23.311 --> 08:30.260
Center for Tropical Agriculture in Columbia and the one for Tropical Agriculture in Nigeria.

08:30.380 --> 08:32.322
But there were plans for others.

08:33.744 --> 08:36.728
And so... And the World Bank was going to help fund it?

08:37.188 --> 08:43.096
It was exploring the possibility, but also as a participant, a funder.

08:43.536 --> 08:49.904
The result was that... And Robert McNamara was the director of the World Bank at that time.

08:49.924 --> 08:50.886
I guess that's right.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.828
I forgot the sequence, but I'm sure he was.

08:53.095 --> 09:02.240
And the first commitment, that is, the three foundations continue to be elaborated.

09:02.441 --> 09:09.079
But USAID said, we will put in a quarter of the total budget,

09:09.532 --> 09:14.778
And it's still in existence, and they wish they hadn't put it on a percentage basis.

09:14.798 --> 09:18.743
Because that means they don't have much funds for other things.

09:19.984 --> 09:23.188
And there are a lot of other good opportunities.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.051
Other governments begin to join.

09:26.071 --> 09:37.024
The World Bank became a sizable contributor.

09:37.358 --> 09:56.345
I think the total budget was $184 million for the 13 institutes that were then in operation.

09:56.365 --> 09:58.729
USAID was the biggest single contributor, 25%.

09:58.749 --> 10:05.779
By that time, 1985, the foundations were only sort of

10:07.531 --> 10:15.321
very modest contributors because these budgets had grown so big that they were in mobilization duties.

10:15.342 --> 10:33.486
But there were about thirty, thirty, the way I remember it, thirty-six or seven, thirty-eight governments who contributed funds to this pool of resources.

10:33.506 --> 10:37.251
There were a bank included, the United Nations Development Program.

10:38.142 --> 10:47.697
The regional development banks like BID, the regional development bank for Latin America, the same for Southeast Asia,

10:49.550 --> 10:52.994
I guess that pretty much covers it.

10:53.014 --> 11:00.784
And are these 13 international institutes then in any sort of a formal arrangement or organization besides just consulting?

11:01.305 --> 11:06.631
Each of those institutes has its own board of directors.

11:06.952 --> 11:13.340
And they're international and background nationality.

11:15.602 --> 11:17.785
Their scientists are also

11:18.220 --> 11:23.107
international from the standpoint of nationality.

11:23.188 --> 11:30.359
They have a prescribed area of research.

11:30.379 --> 11:34.265
Erie is only on rice.

11:34.285 --> 11:40.855
Simmon is in maize, corn, wheat.

11:40.875 --> 11:45.662
Originally we had a small barley program for food, not for beer.

11:46.300 --> 12:01.558
The barley has been transferred to the Dryer Area Research Center in Aleppo, Syria, just a year or so ago.

12:01.578 --> 12:05.222
Ten of those are on plants, species, crops.

12:06.263 --> 12:10.228
Two on animals.

12:10.248 --> 12:15.514
One on developing controls for diseases.

12:16.270 --> 12:25.536
International Livestock Research, I know it's in Ethiopia, on animal diseases.

12:28.264 --> 12:31.613
There are a whole series of diseases.

12:32.133 --> 12:37.599
animals that are potential enemies of domestic livestock in Africa.

12:37.619 --> 12:42.364
They're in the wild reservoir of wild game.

12:42.384 --> 12:52.234
Included, of course, is trypanosomiasis, sleeping sickness, and a lot of other diseases.

12:54.016 --> 12:55.878
And so they're working on that problem.

12:55.898 --> 13:00.182
Then there's animal production program

13:00.550 --> 13:13.755
in Ethiopia, but it's had problems because of the political instabilities there.

13:13.775 --> 13:18.323
So there are two in animals, ten in crops and one in economic policy.

13:18.623 --> 13:19.745
And where's that one?

13:19.785 --> 13:22.629
That one is located in Washington, D.C.

13:22.669 --> 13:31.801
because of availability of library facilities, computer things so that they... It'd have to be in a big research.

13:31.821 --> 13:37.269
It'd have to be in a place where you don't have the isolation like we have in most of the other.

13:37.289 --> 13:39.612
Yeah.

13:39.632 --> 13:40.233
And what's that one?

13:40.253 --> 13:43.317
And the World Bank is there and many of the international... What's that one called?

13:46.101 --> 13:47.083
Let's see.

13:47.103 --> 13:48.124
That's...

13:49.015 --> 13:57.348
International Food Policy Research Institute, if free.

13:57.368 --> 14:02.095
Now... Now, are they in some sort of an umbrella arrangement?

14:02.155 --> 14:04.459
Or, I mean, is there a formal structure?

14:04.519 --> 14:11.369
Every year they have what's called the... Well, they go through this process.

14:11.389 --> 14:17.098
The individual boards of trustees of the institutes have their own meeting.

14:18.412 --> 14:31.044
through which the director of the institute presents the proposal of the budget for the next year with the general plan of work, not the details, but where the money is going to be spent.

14:31.064 --> 14:44.116
This is not only in research, but in training, fellowships, or could be plans for physical plant improvement.

14:44.136 --> 14:44.757
And then,

14:45.293 --> 14:51.603
This is approved or modified by the trustees of that individual institute.

14:51.623 --> 14:54.848
Revised, I shall say.

14:54.868 --> 14:59.876
Then in September, this is done for each individual institute.

15:00.396 --> 15:13.697
Then they come together in Center's Week, a week-long meeting in Washington, D.C., where each of the institutes presents orally and with the visuals.

15:14.268 --> 15:20.316
their plan of work in a general way, their accomplishments first.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.380
Where they are in their research program.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.221
What they've done in a year.

15:24.401 --> 15:28.466
What they've done in a year, or over the last several.

15:28.486 --> 15:29.207
What they want to do.

15:29.227 --> 15:30.449
What they want to do.

15:30.469 --> 15:37.678
And the monies that are required to do this.

15:37.698 --> 15:41.203
Each institute does it independently.

15:41.690 --> 15:47.800
All of the donor agencies are there.

15:47.820 --> 15:48.300
It's open to the public.

15:48.320 --> 15:52.006
And generally, they have to prune back.

15:52.026 --> 16:01.461
And they try to cut back so that all of the institutes will have to bear their share of the cut.

16:01.481 --> 16:09.013
Depending on the monies that are pledged, there have to be minor adjustments later.

16:09.584 --> 16:17.695
And, of course, one of the disturbing influences is the rates of inflation, which is not the same in all countries.

16:17.715 --> 16:18.816
Exactly.

16:18.836 --> 16:21.420
So it gets pretty complicated.

16:23.122 --> 16:23.442
I can imagine.

16:23.462 --> 16:30.071
I can imagine dealing with the peso, how complicated it would get.

16:30.091 --> 16:31.533
You'd have to re-figure every week.

16:32.154 --> 16:36.199
You know, for example, let's see what it figures out.

16:42.271 --> 17:09.865
If you considered, how much does it take of increased food production to pay for that hundred, what did I say?

17:11.043 --> 17:17.814
184 million dollar budget for the global budget.

17:17.834 --> 17:21.379
184 million.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.703
There, you're good at this.

17:23.723 --> 17:32.297
184 million, let's say, yeah, just for rough figuring, let's say, we'll call it wheat, $130 a ton.

17:32.317 --> 17:32.657
184.

17:32.718 --> 17:33.359
184 million.

17:35.282 --> 17:35.382
Tons.

17:35.402 --> 17:35.682
Wait a minute.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.023
Dollars.

17:37.305 --> 17:37.405
Okay.

17:45.130 --> 18:00.011
And if each ton of wheat is worth 130, take... So we're dividing 130 into 184 million dollars?

18:00.031 --> 18:00.972
Is that what we want to do?

18:01.473 --> 18:01.813
I guess so.

18:02.114 --> 18:03.396
Let's see how it comes out.

18:07.141 --> 18:07.341
Big stack.

18:32.144 --> 18:36.169
Well, if it were 100, it'd be 130 million.

18:37.310 --> 18:37.670
Yeah.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.715
I mean, it'd be, yeah, it was $100.

18:42.015 --> 18:47.902
So it's 130 to about one in the third million.

18:48.402 --> 18:49.584
Yeah, right, that's about it.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.987
One in the third, yeah.

18:53.007 --> 18:59.755
And you see, last year's increased wheat production in India, for example,

19:00.494 --> 19:02.516
compared to the base period that we used.

19:02.596 --> 19:15.432
The average wheat production in India before the advent of the new technology, an average for 1960 to 66 was 11 million tons.

19:15.452 --> 19:21.178
Last year it was 46 million tons.

19:21.198 --> 19:30.349
So 46 from 11, that's 35 million tons more last year's harvest over the base period.

19:32.422 --> 19:36.688
This is not a very big part.

19:37.609 --> 19:42.416
That's for the total effect all around the world on all crops.

19:43.458 --> 19:52.911
I used an analogy of just the impact of new technology in wheat production in India.

19:52.931 --> 20:00.842
Now that's not net because this includes the other costs, but nonetheless gives you an insight into

20:01.514 --> 20:05.421
economic impact that has come from this.

20:05.441 --> 20:06.904
Let's go back to the organization.

20:06.924 --> 20:22.172
And that increased production, for example, of 46 million compared to the base of 11, or in other words, that 35 million additional tons fed

20:22.507 --> 20:38.289
They provided about 65% of the calories and protein for an additional 250 million people just in India, just the one crop, without considering what's happened in rice and other crops.

20:38.810 --> 20:42.095
Now, all of that didn't come just from the institute.

20:42.115 --> 20:47.282
This is a composite effect of agricultural research and its application.

20:47.836 --> 20:48.838
from many sources.

20:49.418 --> 20:55.428
But the institutes, the international institutes, I think we can say were catalysts.

20:55.448 --> 21:06.285
And also in many cases, the generators of the basic information and materials that when put into operation commercially resulted in these changes.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.773
And, okay, let's go back now to the early 1970s.

21:12.174 --> 21:14.738
At that time, was there

21:15.308 --> 21:16.991
I know that they all meet once a year.

21:17.071 --> 21:20.076
They all discuss this for funding and where they've been.

21:20.477 --> 21:25.365
But at that time, was there sort of an umbrella type organization formed?

21:26.547 --> 21:28.530
In 71.

21:28.550 --> 21:29.492
And what's the name of that?

21:30.253 --> 21:37.024
CGIAR, Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research.

21:37.044 --> 21:37.145
Okay.

21:38.026 --> 21:40.410
CGIAR, okay.

21:41.432 --> 21:41.552
CGIAR.

21:42.663 --> 21:43.945
And is that in Washington, D.C.?

21:43.965 --> 21:45.767
It's in Washington, D.C.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.629
The Secretariat is in the World Bank.

21:47.649 --> 21:49.552
Okay, okay.

21:49.572 --> 21:57.122
And it's through that that the information from each one of the individual research institutes is disseminated to the others?

21:57.703 --> 21:59.605
No, they disseminate.

21:59.625 --> 22:03.110
Each one has their own office of publication.

22:03.130 --> 22:07.996
They disseminate their own.

22:08.016 --> 22:10.980
They're pretty much autonomous.

22:11.000 --> 22:11.100
Okay.

22:11.738 --> 22:38.944
Now, let's move this up to date with how these institutes, we've already seen how these institutes would deal with an issue like wheat production, dealing with your life.

22:39.700 --> 22:47.933
Now, let's take an issue, a contemporary issue, Africa and starvation in Africa.

22:49.095 --> 22:57.849
Let's just go through a scenario of how they would help bring about ending the starvation problem in Africa.

22:58.750 --> 23:04.599
Well, this is in part why I made that trip to Africa last week.

23:06.582 --> 23:07.564
It's my contention.

23:08.101 --> 23:13.508
that the institutes today are not like the institutes when they were first formed.

23:13.528 --> 23:31.533
Because at that time, or the pre-international institutes, the old Rock Color Forward programs, had at least the wheat program always measured itself by how much additional food was produced.

23:31.553 --> 23:33.856
In other words, it didn't stop with doing the research.

23:34.397 --> 23:36.420
It didn't stop with breeding the variety.

23:36.704 --> 23:41.489
or incorporating the disease resistance.

23:41.509 --> 23:55.205
It didn't stop with running a fertilizer test to know which kind of fertilizer and how much, or how to control this weed, or how to do this, but how at the right time you transferred that technology to the farm.

23:56.166 --> 23:59.269
And it was done, for example, Mexico essentially became

23:59.637 --> 24:03.525
self-sufficient and weak production before there was an extension service.

24:03.545 --> 24:05.008
It wasn't there when we arrived.

24:05.749 --> 24:16.330
The extension service was established in 1955 by transplanting about 25 of our best young scientists that had been trained in research.

24:16.850 --> 24:20.856
to form the beginning of an extension circle.

24:20.876 --> 24:24.281
But Mexico became self-sufficient in wheat production in 56.

24:24.422 --> 24:27.707
In other words, before they got their feet on the ground.

24:27.727 --> 24:37.862
The reason being that when there was no vehicle, we ourselves had to get out onto the farms and that on-farm testing became also an on-farm demonstration and we

24:39.074 --> 24:50.469
Some of us in the early times knew that we could never get this technology pulled off unless we talked to the right policy makers about pricing, about fertilizer.

24:51.811 --> 24:54.895
We had to assume this responsibility or nothing would have happened.

24:55.436 --> 24:59.902
But today, these institutions are much more sophisticated.

24:59.922 --> 25:03.006
Of course, there's a lot more trained people scattered around the world.

25:02.986 --> 25:12.378
with the exception of the African countries, which are now kind of like it was when we started Mexico way back there in the early 40s.

25:14.601 --> 25:30.141
But I'm fearful also that there's a lot of, after looking at this African situation and reading their publications, that there's a lot of information that's useful and plant materials that are available.

25:30.560 --> 25:35.886
that need to be transferred to the farms to produce more food.

25:35.906 --> 25:39.710
It's not moving off the experiment stations.

25:39.730 --> 25:43.935
So in other words, you think that there's enough information to resolve the African crisis?

25:44.115 --> 25:46.157
Not all of them, but to make a big start.

25:46.177 --> 25:57.630
And since research is continuous, if your extension service is utilizing the best that's available and getting it out there,

25:58.100 --> 26:08.351
The research is back behind and linked together, and somebody is worrying about policy, how to get this all integrated.

26:08.371 --> 26:12.195
Did we talk about my philosophy about integration?

26:13.936 --> 26:15.478
Well, go ahead, tell it to me.

26:16.099 --> 26:24.107
I'll give you a couple of sheets here someplace if I can lay hands on it, but here's what it is.

26:24.610 --> 26:53.875
I have found from personal experience that no matter how excellent the research in one particular discipline of agricultural science, whether it be the plant breeding, varietal improvement, whether it be the work on soil fertility, how to restore soil fertility, whether it be the control of weeds, whether it be conservation of moisture or proper irrigation practices, whether it be control of diseases or insects,

26:54.040 --> 27:03.151
As long as those are used in isolation, they have very little impact.

27:03.171 --> 27:07.736
Somebody has to go the extra mile to put them all together.

27:08.337 --> 27:23.254
And I saw this very early, as early as 1949, that if we were going to do something to affect production, I had to become involved in all of this.

27:24.736 --> 27:33.030
In the beginning, I was probably rather weak in the whole area of soil fertility.

27:34.273 --> 27:47.115
I had taken some courses, but the first year I worked with Bill Caldwell, who was our first soil scientist in the Mexican rock fellow program, but he left a year later.

27:50.808 --> 28:05.770
So we carried on the best we could, continuing to work with fertilizers and soil fertility and agronomic practices, in addition to the breeding work that I personally was responsible for and the disease work on wheat.

28:05.790 --> 28:12.439
Then we got another soil scientist and he stayed only a short time and left.

28:12.519 --> 28:19.870
We got a third one and then he branched out into working on other crops and never stayed at it.

28:20.120 --> 28:31.117
So in the first eight years, we had eight agronomist soil scientists, no continuity, but we kept going despite that ourselves out on the farm.

28:31.137 --> 28:43.916
And so by the time this had all unfolded, we knew pretty much what had to be done.

28:43.936 --> 28:45.098
I could see that

28:45.770 --> 28:57.169
We were never going to get anyplace as early as 1948 with all of the maneuvering that was going on by the flour millers.

28:57.189 --> 29:12.233
The weeds that were grown in the central part of Mexico at that time were mixtures of very, many of them were badly mixed fields, very old weeds of nondescript growers, probably some of them dating back to Spanish colonial times.

29:13.090 --> 29:37.714
And I saw that despite the fact that Mexico was importing roughly 50% of its wheat consumption, that at time of harvest, and everything was done in a primitive way, at that time the sickle and the log was shredded out with animals like you see in parts of Asia and Africa today.

29:38.048 --> 29:45.395
the farmer couldn't sell his grain, or he'd have to sell it at half the price.

29:45.415 --> 29:49.639
Generally, at time of harvest, he couldn't sell it.

29:49.659 --> 30:00.569
And the reason was that the milling companies would import, prefer to import wheat, more uniform, better quality.

30:02.991 --> 30:06.975
But then I saw that after two or three months after harvest,

30:07.343 --> 30:13.572
And then these mills would come and buy this for half the price they were paying for imported wheat.

30:13.592 --> 30:28.194
And I told Parar, our director, when I saw what was going on, a year before we started to multiply our first improved variety, I said, Dutch, we're never going to get any price unless we stop this racket.

30:28.374 --> 30:28.474
Yeah.

30:28.724 --> 30:34.489
we've got to make sure that that farmer is going to get paid a fair price for his crop.

30:34.509 --> 30:36.451
And I think it can be handled easily.

30:36.871 --> 30:38.413
Which is the issue of integration.

30:38.813 --> 30:39.254
Sure.

30:39.274 --> 30:47.521
And he said, we'll go see the minister or the sub-secretary handle most of those things.

30:47.541 --> 30:49.183
Engineer Gonzales Gallardo.

30:49.223 --> 30:52.045
We told him, look, this is happening.

30:52.286 --> 30:53.547
These abuses.

30:53.567 --> 30:56.509
The farmer is being paid half of what he's due.

30:58.091 --> 30:58.191
Yeah.

30:59.690 --> 31:11.648
easily solved if you don't issue any permits until they've bought all of that grain and bought it at more or less the world price.

31:11.668 --> 31:14.653
He's multiplied.

31:14.673 --> 31:20.161
He sat there and thought of it and he says, it doesn't look very complicated.

31:20.402 --> 31:22.785
We'll do it.

31:22.805 --> 31:28.414
That's the way you learn in the battle of needs and politics.

31:28.951 --> 31:36.503
about moving the whole package together, the economic part, the policy, as it relates to economic policy.

31:36.584 --> 31:44.817
Well, relate that to the organizations that we were talking about, or the institutes, and integration into Africa today.

31:45.320 --> 31:49.886
There is where these institutes are not doing this at this time.

31:50.366 --> 31:53.210
Not moving it out onto the land.

31:53.230 --> 31:56.254
So that's the difference between 20 years ago and now.

31:57.135 --> 31:58.217
That's your opinion, right?

31:58.497 --> 32:10.332
My opinion is that too many, now there are exceptions, too many of the scientists at the present time in those institutes come from affluent nations.

32:10.953 --> 32:23.382
or they might be scientists from a developing nation who studied in the affluent nations, see that you do the research and it's automatically applied.

32:24.224 --> 32:26.970
They forget that our farmers

32:27.760 --> 32:30.925
and livestock people are highly educated people.

32:30.986 --> 32:37.156
They come to the experiment stations and the laboratories and they're waiting for whatever new development.

32:37.497 --> 32:46.292
The private sector has, whether it's feed or fertilizer or weed killers or insecticides, they're out there promoting it.

32:46.373 --> 32:47.395
Not so in Africa.

32:47.775 --> 32:48.557
It's moving.

32:48.697 --> 32:49.438
It's moving.

32:49.458 --> 32:50.620
It's not that way in Africa.

32:51.422 --> 32:54.688
In Africa, you've got to do what we did in the wheat program in Mexico.

32:54.968 --> 32:59.596
Unfortunately, the corn program never did it under the same roof.

32:59.616 --> 33:07.470
The impact of the corn program, which is budget-wise, has spent twice as much money as the wheat program from the beginning of the Rockefeller program.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.339
has yet to make its impact.

33:10.359 --> 33:11.560
And there are many reasons.

33:11.580 --> 33:13.402
Lack of continuity.

33:13.622 --> 33:28.617
In the same period when I was the director of the Wheaton Research and Production Program, those 40 years, 39, whatever it was, that's not just rock tunnel, the continuity into cinema.

33:30.619 --> 33:31.620
I was the only director.

33:34.142 --> 33:37.305
Whereas Bourne had eight

33:38.230 --> 33:41.976
And every time you get a new director, they change the direction, new ways.

33:42.316 --> 33:45.221
And then the young people get disoriented and disillusioned.

33:45.241 --> 33:47.184
They say, what in the hell is going on here?

33:47.525 --> 33:53.013
They're going in a different direction and they throw in the sponge and they go and look for a job someplace else.

33:53.574 --> 33:55.497
There's a whole series of things.

33:55.477 --> 33:57.739
that continuity provides.

33:58.740 --> 34:02.144
And it doesn't have to be a heavy fist in continuity.

34:02.664 --> 34:08.250
And I never asked any young scientist to do something that I wasn't willing to do myself.

34:08.951 --> 34:18.841
And I think this was a good part of the reason that we had a very harmonious group of scientists.

34:18.861 --> 34:24.707
Now you said that there were two of these international institutes in Ethiopia,

34:25.092 --> 34:25.933
Is that right?

34:26.053 --> 34:26.234
No.

34:26.714 --> 34:30.039
The animal one for diseases is in Kenya.

34:30.059 --> 34:30.300
Okay.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.963
The one on animal production is in Ethiopia.

34:32.983 --> 34:33.084
Okay.

34:33.644 --> 34:37.590
And what are those institutes doing to help solve this problem in Africa?

34:38.471 --> 34:47.445
Well, there are other... The animal sciences, I should point out, also, were started much later.

34:48.266 --> 34:48.466
Yeah.

34:48.486 --> 34:53.293
But EITA, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Nigeria,

34:53.948 --> 34:58.915
was the one, two, three, fourth institute to be founded.

34:58.935 --> 35:13.857
And it works on tropical crops included in Krasava, root crops, cowpeas, a number of these kinds of tropical crops.

35:14.998 --> 35:19.585
It also is linked to the cement and does some work on corn.

35:20.746 --> 35:27.533
I can link to Icarusac Institute in South India that works on Assura.

35:27.553 --> 35:34.840
But up to now, there's been no major impact out of any of those three.

35:36.401 --> 35:36.682
None?

35:37.863 --> 35:39.644
You can measure in tonnage of food.

35:40.726 --> 35:44.009
That's clearly definable to that.

35:44.209 --> 35:48.373
The truth is that of the institutes now in operation,

35:49.855 --> 35:52.477
The ones that have made the contributions up to now.

35:53.899 --> 36:00.245
Semen, largely because of wheat, but in some minor way in corn.

36:01.186 --> 36:03.428
Eerie in rice.

36:03.448 --> 36:08.753
And the Potato Institute in some countries.

36:09.714 --> 36:13.057
And now Sorghum is coming on pretty good.

36:13.077 --> 36:16.300
And I think this is... And where are the Potato and the Sorghum Institutes?

36:16.600 --> 36:18.782
The Potato Institute is in Peru.

36:19.842 --> 36:29.435
The Sorghum Institute, it's sorghum, chickpea, peanuts, millet.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.678
It's located in Hyderabad, India.

36:31.698 --> 36:39.228
They're working with substations in Africa.

36:39.248 --> 36:44.115
But you see, this stuff's got to move.

36:44.715 --> 36:45.917
Oh, absolutely.

36:48.108 --> 37:00.841
But my own opinion is, this is a very personal point of view, but I think that they tried to expand the number of these institutes too fast.

37:02.683 --> 37:17.558
They should have, wherever you had the right mix of all people that had been through the wars with only modest equipment, they had to use quite a bit of it between the ears.

37:19.040 --> 37:24.666
They got things done not only on the experiment station, but basically.

37:24.686 --> 37:28.290
Because they had the technical and bureaucratic know-how to get things done.

37:30.131 --> 37:30.252
Right.

37:30.272 --> 37:33.895
And they weren't satisfied with just doing the research.

37:33.975 --> 37:34.716
Application.

37:34.736 --> 37:38.100
They were measured.

37:38.660 --> 37:45.267
We had some philosophical discussions very early, the difference between corn and wheat program in Mexico.

37:45.736 --> 38:07.388
And I got particular hell once a year from Herrera, the president by then of the Raunfella Foundation.

38:07.408 --> 38:11.754
Well, I started getting the static when he was director of all of their agricultural programs, agricultural sciences, before he became the president.

38:11.774 --> 38:14.118
But each year when we turn in our annual report, which I did religiously, and I thought I wrote a pretty good report.

38:14.138 --> 38:15.540
They were not lengthy, but they all went into one condensed RF report.

38:17.157 --> 38:22.488
And invariably he'd say, where the hell are your publications?

38:22.508 --> 38:31.326
And once in a while I'd go to a game, but very seldom.

38:31.346 --> 38:32.989
I'd go to a very few big science meetings and I figured they were a waste of time.

38:33.712 --> 38:38.500
And there's so much other things to be done.

38:38.520 --> 38:48.615
And the same way, I said, I guess I've been on vacation really for 10 years.

38:48.636 --> 38:50.478
I'm not advocating that for other people, but that's, hell, I'm always behind the way it is.

38:50.498 --> 38:59.112
And meanwhile, the corn people started a whole series of beautiful publications on the evolution of corn.

39:00.087 --> 39:05.795
going back to all of the old types that they collected and how they evolved.

39:06.736 --> 39:10.741
They worked with Paul Mangelsdorf, who was one of our first consultants.

39:10.761 --> 39:14.707
Now, what type of publications are you talking about publications like this?

39:15.127 --> 39:20.495
I mean, was he talking about your own personal scientific publications and scientific journals?

39:21.716 --> 39:21.796
Yes.

39:21.816 --> 39:26.803
And these were very fancy ones.

39:27.323 --> 39:41.069
And it's pretty esoteric and knobs on the chromosomes and how did they get there from which wild grass were they interdressed and all of these sorts of things.

39:41.089 --> 39:42.692
But it had not a damn thing to do with producing more corn.

39:42.712 --> 39:43.413
And a lot of effort went into this.

39:43.433 --> 39:46.900
And he'd say, where are yours, my daddy?

39:46.920 --> 39:50.867
Hell, you're ruining your own reputation if you don't publish it.

39:51.691 --> 39:59.560
Andy said, moreover, you don't get the information out about what's going on.

39:59.580 --> 40:01.222
I said, you know, there are several ways of getting information out.

40:01.242 --> 40:03.945
All of these young people that come to work here, they know what's going on.

40:03.965 --> 40:06.247
That's one way of disseminating.

40:06.267 --> 40:19.622
And when I have a farmer's field day, or when I give a series of conferences around Mexico directed at the farmer in the next years of production, originally it used to be pretty miserable.

40:19.990 --> 40:23.194
but we got the enthusiasm going with farmer's field days.

40:23.855 --> 40:31.665
I think I told you about the first ones, and I got 25, and then in a few years there were thousands.

40:32.086 --> 40:40.817
You get the radio people involved, you get a lot of publicity, but it didn't show in official publications.

40:40.837 --> 40:49.508
But in 1956, when I got this same song and dance when I turned in my annual report,

40:50.129 --> 40:58.176
I said, what about your publication?

40:58.196 --> 40:58.557
I said, all right.

40:58.577 --> 40:59.518
Mexico is self-sufficient in wheat production.

40:59.538 --> 41:01.299
What the hell did we come down here for?

41:01.700 --> 41:08.746
To write learned publications or to grow more wheat and fill empty bellies?

41:08.766 --> 41:15.032
That's the last time I ever heard anything about that.

41:15.052 --> 41:17.174
But corn has publications.

41:17.194 --> 41:18.035
Yeah.

41:18.055 --> 41:18.195
Mm-hmm.

41:19.289 --> 41:22.613
and not a hell of a lot more to show for them compared to what they should have.

41:23.394 --> 41:34.446
Corn, the important role that it has in developing countries of Latin America and in Africa should be way out front.

41:34.466 --> 41:39.312
And this doesn't mean that they haven't had good scientists.

41:39.492 --> 41:45.559
I'll bet if those eight corn directors, six of them were damn sight better scientists than I was.

41:45.579 --> 41:46.680
But they never...

41:47.318 --> 42:03.218
stayed long enough, or they were more interested in the theoretical, didn't have any real drive to put the information into, to integrate it and put it into production.

42:03.238 --> 42:11.308
And they didn't know how to handle political leaders to get the right policies, economic policies.

42:11.328 --> 42:14.372
You know, if you're going to move production,

42:18.284 --> 42:33.869
You better know when to keep a low profile and talk in a quiet voice and when to change and become aggressive in order to win the point that's necessary to hit the shore on the road.

42:33.889 --> 42:39.318
That may sound very crude, but... That's what you said in this publication.

42:39.338 --> 42:43.404
This one.

42:43.424 --> 42:45.928
On how to deal with African problems.

42:48.001 --> 42:49.382
Well, that's where we are right now.

42:49.402 --> 42:51.304
There's a couple of sheets.

42:51.584 --> 42:52.205
Let me see.

42:52.826 --> 42:56.929
If you turn that off just a second, I'll see if she's got it.

42:57.970 --> 42:59.612
We're still talking about integration.

42:59.772 --> 43:01.334
Okay, let's continue.

43:01.354 --> 43:15.527
We need... We need the best specialist in all of the fields of science that affect agriculture and food production, and for that matter, also utilization.

43:17.245 --> 43:38.686
But we need a few that are also integrators, that can put all of the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together, and that are comfortable in trying to do so, despite the fact that there are many headaches and problems all along the way.

43:38.926 --> 43:46.493
If you stay in the shade and comfort of your own tree, your own specialty, it's comfortable.

43:47.165 --> 44:03.127
But that will never produce a successful management of that forest because the forests are made up of the shadows of many trees and even many different species of trees.

44:03.147 --> 44:13.982
And there are gray areas between the shadows of each tree or each specialty which you must venture into if you're going to manage that forest.

44:14.232 --> 44:33.997
with all of its complexities and interactions, for the production of the maximum amount of lumber, of fuel, for the indirect values of habitat for wildlife, for outdoor recreation, for watershed protection, for all of these.

44:34.618 --> 44:41.286
And so it is in integrating all of these disciplines that go into first the production,

44:43.055 --> 45:03.898
of food, not just the biological package and the soil package, but the economic policies, the credit, and the storage transform, and finally the utilization.

45:05.735 --> 45:07.780
Exactly the things that you did in Mexico.

45:08.121 --> 45:09.425
You've got to put them all together.

45:10.026 --> 45:12.773
Nothing happened.

45:12.793 --> 45:21.195
And that's exactly what we need in Africa, according to that article that you wrote, or that, you know, according to this right here.

45:21.175 --> 45:24.378
Yeah, that's exactly what it means.

45:24.398 --> 45:25.940
And that's why I'm so damn frustrated now.

45:25.980 --> 45:28.582
I've got the people that can do it.

45:28.742 --> 45:29.623
And the data's there.

45:30.224 --> 45:33.327
But whether I can get the organizational structure right.

45:33.447 --> 45:36.430
And if I can't, I'll wash my hands up.

45:36.450 --> 45:43.096
I don't want to be associated with wasting $2.5 million right now available for this year.

45:43.877 --> 45:50.423
I don't want to be guilty of wasting that money that I have no control over.

45:50.656 --> 45:55.624
I don't want to have the control that it's the mechanics of handling the budget and all of this.

45:56.285 --> 45:58.188
I don't want a damn thing to do with that.

45:58.989 --> 46:04.217
But on the other hand... But on the other hand, you have to be the counsel to direct that spending of that money.

46:04.237 --> 46:11.187
And to see that it's spent properly for the right things to support the program, to contract the right people.

46:11.909 --> 46:16.315
And if I don't, if I'm not convinced that that's being done, I can't play.

46:17.137 --> 46:18.739
I won't play.

46:19.006 --> 46:20.549
Because the money will be wasted.

46:20.569 --> 46:22.332
Be wasted.

46:22.352 --> 46:22.432
Yep.

46:22.452 --> 46:24.335
Not that it'll be done maliciously.

46:24.355 --> 46:24.595
No.

46:26.739 --> 46:28.963
It'll be done because they don't have the know-how.

46:29.043 --> 46:29.784
Exactly.

46:29.804 --> 46:34.132
Exactly.

46:34.152 --> 46:35.614
That's a good place to end.
