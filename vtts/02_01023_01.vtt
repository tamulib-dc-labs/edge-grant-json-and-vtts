00:01.921 --> 00:10.113
This is an interview with Jerry Singleton by 
Barbara Bell on May 4, 1989, in Dallas, Texas,

00:01.921 --> 00:10.113
concerning his involvement in the Vietnam War. 
Due to the continuing interest in the Vietnam War

00:10.774 --> 00:18.366
by historians, students, and researchers, I 
would like to submit this tape to the Texas A&M

00:10.774 --> 00:18.366
archives. Is that OK with you? Yes, it is. OK, 
thanks. OK, I wanted to begin with asking you about

00:23.173 --> 00:29.903
your military career before the American 
involvement in Vietnam. Isn't it true that you had

00:30.220 --> 00:34.507
started out choosing the military as a career? You 
didn't just enlist at the time of the war? Not

00:40.015 --> 00:41.318
exactly Barbara. I went to the Air Force Academy. 
That was the source of my commission. My plan when I

00:45.664 --> 00:56.802
went there was to fulfill my obligation which was 
going to be a total of about five years including

00:45.664 --> 00:56.802
pilot training. and I planned after that to get out 
and go do some other things. Okay. As

01:04.458 --> 01:21.400
I got into the Air Force on active duty, the 
conviction to get out at the end of my obligation

01:04.458 --> 01:21.400
became less strong, although it was still at least 
off and on part of the plan. Of course, I was shot

01:23.302 --> 01:24.544
down before I got to the termination of my 
obligation. So it was kind of academic after that

01:28.722 --> 01:35.332
point because I already had more than 10 years in 
when I got back home. OK. What was your rank at the

01:35.352 --> 01:41.221
time of your involvement in the war? What year did 
you actually enter the war in? I went to Southeast

01:44.806 --> 01:49.493
Asia in August, or excuse me, October of 1965. And I 
was first lieutenant then, a pilot. OK. And then,

01:53.752 --> 02:00.964
because you just relate your experiences, how 
much involved in the war before you got shot down?

02:01.304 --> 02:02.987
How many months? One. One month. I was over there a 
very short time. I was in an air rescue squadron.

02:12.282 --> 02:20.856
Our mission was to rescue other American military 
pilots that were shot down over enemy territory,

02:12.282 --> 02:20.856
especially over the north. We were the first

02:22.186 --> 02:34.619
what we call permanent party contingent with a 
long range rescue capability to be over there.

02:35.660 --> 02:47.772
Everybody else that had been there before us doing 
that kind of mission had been there on a temporary

02:35.660 --> 02:47.772
duty assignment, usually not to last more than a 
month or two. We were called in over there because

02:49.439 --> 02:58.872
that was just about the time the air war in North 
Vietnam was

02:49.439 --> 02:58.872
really getting to be substantial and regular. 
Earlier than fall of 65, there had been some

03:01.095 --> 03:07.003
airstrikes, but they had been sporadic. There had 
been no continuous strikes. OK. What was your own

03:10.567 --> 03:17.657
personal attitude towards the American 
involvement at the time that you were sent over?

03:24.218 --> 03:29.563
I personally felt like it was a war that needed to be 
fought.

03:29.583 --> 03:36.170
That there were, there was, well, first of all, 
North Vietnam had been partitioned in 1954.

03:38.853 --> 03:42.737
At the end of the French involvement in Indochina. 
At that point, North and South Vietnam were, the

03:44.639 --> 03:51.045
country was divided into North and South. North 
was communist, the South was not. at least as far as

03:54.222 --> 03:58.888
I'm able to tell generally, that was by the choice 
of each country. The North Vietnamese, like

04:00.309 --> 04:09.460
communism typically, cannot tolerate a 
contradiction. And they won't settle for, not

04:11.323 --> 04:20.854
only will they not settle for any alternative in 
their own domain, but they feel, really an

04:22.285 --> 04:35.299
evangelistic obligation to reform the rest of the 
world, they see it as reformation

04:22.285 --> 04:35.299
to make the rest of the world communist. And 
everything that I have seen about communism, at

04:35.319 --> 04:48.833
least through about five years ago, put them in a 
position of

04:51.327 --> 05:00.423
of allowing themselves only one of three 
alternatives with regard to the world, the

04:51.327 --> 05:00.423
non-communist world. And that was either to 
convert us or kill us or die in the effort.

05:07.255 --> 05:09.859
Generally, the South Vietnamese did not want to be 
communist. That doesn't mean that they did

05:11.510 --> 05:14.534
everything right either. They're human beings 
like all of us. But they chose to pursue their own

05:17.258 --> 05:25.149
goals with a non-communist governmental 
organization. The North Vietnamese would not

05:26.651 --> 05:33.962
stand for that if they felt there was anything they 
could do about it. And the question really was not

05:33.982 --> 05:39.109
could they do anything about it, but what. And they 
chose a a form of promoting their ideal that

05:43.370 --> 06:12.988
was I guess generally attributed to Mao Zedong the 
protracted conflict which amounts to continuing

05:43.370 --> 06:12.988
to apply whatever means are appropriate at the 
time whether it's political military or

05:43.370 --> 06:12.988
somewhere in between to convert whoever it is 
that's their target at the time. Of course, in this

06:19.832 --> 06:23.976
case, it was more than just South Vietnam. Their 
target was Laos, South Vietnam, Cambodia, and a

06:25.197 --> 06:36.309
longer time range target, of course, also was 
Thailand. They were active in all four of those

06:36.329 --> 06:39.752
countries. Their primary effort was in South 
Vietnam, and that's where our confrontation

06:40.981 --> 06:45.425
came. I felt like we ought to be there, not because I 
necessarily agreed with everything that the

06:46.846 --> 07:06.384
South Vietnamese were doing, but I felt that they 
ought to have the right to decide for themselves

06:46.846 --> 07:06.384
without somebody holding a gun to their head 
trying to convince them to choose another path.

07:06.404 --> 07:09.267
And that's what I felt like North Vietnam was 
doing. I've heard the argument before that we were

07:09.787 --> 07:16.535
imposing our government upon the South 
Vietnamese. How do you react to that?

07:20.960 --> 07:25.505
I think perhaps we were doing more of that than we 
should. I'm not sure that we had a whole lot of

07:25.545 --> 07:33.494
choice given the situation. In other words, we 
don't want to take our Army, Navy, and Air Force and

07:38.845 --> 07:45.856
give them to a commander of another country and 
say, OK, we're going to let you use our soldiers to

07:38.845 --> 07:45.856
fight your war. That means that we're going to have 
to have some say in the way the war is prosecuted by

07:48.279 --> 08:04.684
our side, our side meaning us as well as the South 
Vietnamese and others that would ally with us. in

08:05.137 --> 08:06.479
Southeast Asia. So your overall attitude as you 
went over was, would you say enthusiastic or at

08:07.180 --> 08:12.226
least supportive? Supportive of the goal. I

08:16.011 --> 08:32.072
think there's a popular misconception among 
civilians about military people, those who

08:16.011 --> 08:32.072
willingly and voluntarily choose a military 
career, that we're hawks.

08:35.056 --> 08:40.021
That's perhaps true of a very, very minor 
minority. But of the group in general, just the

08:40.041 --> 08:43.224
opposite is true. Because when war comes, we're 
the ones that pay the price first, we're the ones

08:43.544 --> 08:49.790
that pay the price most, and our families too. 
That's the last thing in the world we want. My

08:54.695 --> 09:04.084
personal feeling was that I felt privileged to 
live in the kind of country that we lived in.

09:05.617 --> 09:08.219
more freedom than any place else in the world that I 
knew about. Freedom to just live our lives the way

09:09.380 --> 09:16.847
we saw fit, make our own choices, pursue personal 
goals. We didn't have that freedom except by

09:16.867 --> 09:27.036
having earned it, mostly in armed combat. To earn 
it initially as well as to preserve it from those

09:27.056 --> 09:35.404
that wanted to oppose some of their ideals on us.

09:36.751 --> 10:03.568
I also felt that

09:36.751 --> 10:03.568
I could not expect to or demand the right to 
continue enjoying that kind of freedom and all the

09:36.751 --> 10:03.568
benefits of living here

09:36.751 --> 10:03.568
and ask someone else to go out and do the fighting 
for me to continue to protect it and preserve it for

09:36.751 --> 10:03.568
us as well as other nations in the world that want to 
have the same right of choice that we do. I didn't

10:09.886 --> 10:21.998
feel like I had the right to expect someone else to 
do all the dirty work and consequently while I

10:09.886 --> 10:21.998
certainly didn't want to go to war I wasn't 
dragging my heels. It seemed like an appropriate

10:22.218 --> 10:31.648
obligation and I would certainly

10:33.198 --> 10:51.067
Especially at that time, given the nature of 
communism as we were able to know it as it

10:33.198 --> 10:51.067
manifested itself, I would much rather knock 
heads with them someplace else than having to do it

10:33.198 --> 10:51.067
in my own backyard when my wife and kids are sitting 
in the house. Would you say then, or did you feel

10:51.528 --> 10:58.058
that the North Vietnamese attack upon South 
Vietnam was maybe an indirect attack? upon

10:59.017 --> 10:59.998
America? You were talking about defending your 
country, so did you feel that if it went too far it

11:00.178 --> 11:09.207
could eventually threaten us or threaten our 
allies? Well, the activity in Southeast Asia

11:10.528 --> 11:17.495
specifically was not a threat to us. As one more 
manifestation of the Communist desire to convert

11:26.489 --> 11:30.814
the world, or they would feel it was an obligation.

11:35.279 --> 11:40.544
It was a part of the same effort. That particular 
part was not pointed directly at me and my family in

11:40.565 --> 11:45.890
this country. But if they hadn't had to exert time 
and effort in prosecuting that war over there, it

11:55.548 --> 12:06.220
would have left them a lot more resources to employ 
in a manner that would have had a more direct effect

11:55.548 --> 12:06.220
on our country. OK. Another one of the issues 
brought up at times is that some of the people that

12:06.841 --> 12:17.773
went to war had the black and white mentality of 
previous wars. The World War II, we're good,

12:17.854 --> 12:21.758
they're bad. the same with Korea, and that maybe 
that wasn't necessarily applicable to the

12:21.974 --> 12:27.059
Vietnam War. Do you feel that that attitude was 
prevalent, that yes, we're good, they're bad, and

12:27.600 --> 12:34.547
that's the way it is, we need to go out and defeat 
them? Or do you think it was a little more gray maybe

12:34.927 --> 12:38.150
once we got into it? I think it depends on who you're 
asking the question to.

12:46.518 --> 12:50.142
For me, the lines were pretty clearly drawn. And I 
say that not because it seemed so white on our side,

12:51.742 --> 13:19.302
but because the communists had made it clear that 
they would not accept anything less or anything

12:51.742 --> 13:19.302
else than a communist-dominated, ruled,

12:51.742 --> 13:19.302
operated world. they gave every indication that 
since the end of the Second World War that that was

13:19.687 --> 13:26.313
their goal. Every time we turned around they were 
taking off another chunk here and another bite

13:27.274 --> 13:46.572
there and I really felt like

13:27.274 --> 13:46.572
like the communist world primarily dominated by 
Soviet communism and Chinese communism there is a

13:47.092 --> 14:15.985
difference but their goals were the same that if if 
we did not stand up every time they confronted

13:47.092 --> 14:15.985
part of the non-communist world someplace

13:47.092 --> 14:15.985
there wasn't anyone else who really had the the 
strength to do it. And if we didn't stand up, and

14:18.339 --> 14:26.487
every time we did, they took another piece out of 
what had formerly been a non-communist part of the

14:18.339 --> 14:26.487
work. It was chipping away? Yes. And everything 
they said and everything they did indicated they

14:29.990 --> 14:38.839
had a single mindset, and it was all going that same 
direction. So in that sense, it was black and

14:39.300 --> 14:42.883
white. In another sense,

14:43.994 --> 14:51.823
there was a whole lot of gray even to me. Our 
nation's not perfect.

14:55.647 --> 15:01.273
And as much as I dislike communism in general, 
everything they're trying to do is not bad. So it's

15:02.534 --> 15:05.818
a mix. And I think for our nation, I think

15:12.277 --> 15:23.146
whatever issues people may have thought of 
regarding that war, in general, were extremely

15:12.277 --> 15:23.146
clouded at best. This is a question that historian 
after historian after historian has analyzed.

15:28.190 --> 15:36.778
And as succinctly as you can, what is your opinion 
on the reason why we lost the war? Do you feel it's

15:36.798 --> 15:41.862
the way we fought it, the government, the 
administration? lack of leadership qualities.

15:45.985 --> 15:47.427
There's been so many different theories. Before 
we get into your own personal experiences, just as

15:48.267 --> 15:52.632
an overall view. I don't think we ever decided what 
we intended to do when we went there. That's about

15:59.539 --> 16:01.701
as succinct as it can be. We never had well-defined

16:02.221 --> 16:07.387
goals or objectives. And it ate our lunch the whole 
time we were involved. it hampered our leadership

16:13.752 --> 16:37.617
because without a goal they felt like they ought to 
do something but they didn't know what and every

16:13.752 --> 16:37.617
action was taken they had no goal to measure it by to 
say yes we're going the right direction or no we

16:13.752 --> 16:37.617
need to do something else and kind of feeling their 
way along yeah now that's very simplified there's

16:13.752 --> 16:37.617
a whole lot more to it than that and i think probably 
just about any of the theories that have been

16:38.592 --> 16:47.166
espoused in this regard at least have some merit 
and have a part to play someplace. Okay. Well,

16:48.107 --> 16:55.219
let's move along then to your own personal 
experience since that's the most interesting to

16:48.107 --> 16:55.219
me at this point. Again, if you want to start with 
the actual date of your capture, however you want

16:56.120 --> 17:05.916
to go about it, you were flying, were you a pilot at 
the time? I was a pilot. We were on a rescue mission.

17:12.603 --> 17:17.350
We were attempting to rescue an F-105 pilot that 
had been shot down a day earlier. There was a

17:18.111 --> 17:24.681
search mission in progress trying to locate him. 
One of the search aircraft was shot down, and we

17:26.103 --> 17:34.536
were scrambled to rescue the pilot of one of the 
search aircraft. That was the 6th of November,

17:35.107 --> 17:38.631
1965. We were shot down that afternoon on the way in 
to make the rescue. About what part, what area was

17:46.341 --> 17:50.546
going around? We were about 35 to 40 miles from 
Hanoi, which was, we were flying a rescue

17:50.566 --> 17:59.497
helicopter unarmed. It was a very early version.

18:05.127 --> 18:12.617
very limited capability and increased 
vulnerability for a number of reasons, which

18:05.127 --> 18:12.617
really put us between a rock and a hard place. It was 
also early in the war. We had no

18:16.402 --> 18:26.837
rescue history to learn from, at least in the 
Vietnamese context. So we were trying to figure

18:27.918 --> 18:34.307
out how to write the book as we were flying our 
missions. And

18:35.840 --> 18:45.936
you were first taken to, apparently you were 
shifted from several different camps, correct?

18:47.118 --> 18:48.200
Where did they take you first? Well, I managed to 
play hide and seek for about five days before they

18:48.781 --> 18:55.672
finally caught me. And was taken out to a road. I was 
just guarded kind of in an open cave, a half-open

19:01.861 --> 19:06.527
cave, for a couple of days. They took me to a couple 
of the local villages, and I was the show-and-tell

19:07.408 --> 19:15.699
for the local political cadres. I was taken to 
another prison that I'm sure had been used by the

19:15.719 --> 19:25.612
French, was now used by the North Vietnamese for 
their own political prisoners, I'm sure. I spent

19:27.555 --> 19:29.978
about five days there, and then was taken to Hanoi. 
That was, in Hanoi, was kind of the introduction to

19:31.865 --> 19:43.863
the real POW system in North Vietnam. Up until 
then, we were just being escalated up the chain

19:43.883 --> 19:58.885
from the people who captured us and really didn't 
know what to do into people who were a little better

19:43.883 --> 19:58.885
trained, a little closer to the home operation 
until we finally arrived in Hanoi. What are your

19:59.557 --> 20:03.222
first impressions of the place? Were you 
blindfolded a lot of the time or did you see it as you

20:03.242 --> 20:07.587
were walking in? We were blindfolded.

20:14.156 --> 20:19.342
There were three of us, I think, being moved at the 
same time, three members of my crew. We had not

20:19.863 --> 20:21.385
gotten together on the ground. We hadn't seen each 
other since bailout. We did get to identify each

20:23.806 --> 20:30.536
other with names, but we'd catch a rifle button 
aside for talking and looking out from under the

20:23.806 --> 20:30.536
blindfold. So we were doing as much as we could get 
away with. My first sensation was being hungry,

20:33.921 --> 20:38.387
because I'd been five days without food or water. I 
felt like that was the way I started off, and I

20:39.609 --> 20:43.154
really never got full until I got out. I believe it. 
It wasn't quite that bad, because toward the end,

20:45.377 --> 20:52.868
they did try to fatten us up to make things look 
better.

20:56.054 --> 21:15.122
That, the time when I was captured was still early 
enough in the war when they

20:56.054 --> 21:15.122
had not even formulated a, the North Vietnamese 
had not even formulated a procedure as to what to do

20:56.054 --> 21:15.122
with us, much less a plan. So it was a lot easier for 
us to get away with things We had been through

21:22.008 --> 21:33.265
survival training, we had been through simulated 
POW situations,

21:22.008 --> 21:33.265
and at least had some idea of what to expect. I was 
surprised at how good the training was. Was it

21:36.490 --> 21:38.173
fairly accurate? I had no surprises for the first 
year. Wow. And I could write the script for them

21:41.638 --> 21:46.986
when they took me to that first village that I just 
described. One of the local political cadres was

21:48.181 --> 21:54.914
supposed to be interrogating me and speaking 
through an interpreter. He wouldn't answer his

21:54.934 --> 21:56.176
questions. So I knew that wasn't going to last 
long. The next thing he pulled out his little 9mm

21:59.322 --> 22:09.261
automatic and put it up to my head and I was going to 
have to answer the questions or he was going to

21:59.322 --> 22:09.261
shoot me. Essentially, from the survival 
training, I knew one of two things were going to

22:10.135 --> 22:13.199
happen. Either he was going to kill me or he wasn't. 
And whether I answered his silly questions wasn't

22:15.342 --> 22:19.108
going to make any difference. So that's kind of the 
way things went, at least through that first year.

22:26.278 --> 22:39.417
Once we got into Hanoi and into

22:26.278 --> 22:39.417
the hands of those who were prepared to guard us and 
treat us as prisoners, things got to be a little

22:26.278 --> 22:39.417
different. Some of the senior officers had 
already been very severely tortured, badly

22:40.021 --> 22:50.552
mistreated, and we were the whole time.

22:54.116 --> 22:55.677
I say the whole time until the end. Right before the 
end, things changed rather substantially. But

23:02.064 --> 23:05.708
the All of the communist countries that signed the 
Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners

23:07.831 --> 23:14.657
of war took exception to one of the provisions. And 
with invariably American military men captured

23:15.738 --> 23:24.326
by communists are treated as war criminals. And 
they claim that's what we are because of the

23:25.087 --> 23:29.211
exception they take. So that was their attitude 
toward us. Also, The general communist approach

23:36.890 --> 23:41.276
to our treatment of prisoners of war is 
exploitation. They're the ones who first really

23:42.137 --> 23:46.243
used that idea. Historically, before that point, 
you might try to torture the prisoners to get some

23:47.044 --> 23:55.696
military information.

23:59.160 --> 24:06.390
Generally, other countries didn't want to keep 
prisoners because it just meant you had to house

23:59.160 --> 24:06.390
and feed them, and they were excess baggage. But 
either extraction of military information or

24:07.687 --> 24:17.176
treating them as excess baggage was the only 
approach toward prisoners. The communists

24:17.997 --> 24:20.840
decided to exploit them for political purposes. 
And what that meant, among other things, was they

24:21.841 --> 24:33.913
were continually trying to extract or extort some

24:21.841 --> 24:33.913
kind of information paper or statement from us 
that they could use for political propaganda. And

24:39.534 --> 24:56.256
they would call you in and want you to sign a 
statement of discrediting your country and

24:39.534 --> 24:56.256
then... Yeah, except usually they wanted us to 
write it because they weren't that sophisticated

24:39.534 --> 24:56.256
in English to do it themselves. And that left us a 
little bit out too. On the topic of exploitation,

25:01.670 --> 25:11.561
one good example of that would be the March of 
Hanoi, and you took part in this, correct? Yes. Can

25:12.041 --> 25:13.083
you talk about that? Apparently there were 
different versions of what it was for, depending

25:13.143 --> 25:24.015
on who you heard, which government talked about 
it. Okay.

25:30.020 --> 25:38.009
It was really bad news all the way, Barbara.

25:38.029 --> 25:46.739
It appeared from everything that I've seen and 
heard that they had

25:38.029 --> 25:46.739
probably three purposes in mind. The most 
important was pumping up their own people. North

25:52.125 --> 25:58.693
Vietnam had been bombed rather heavily for a year 
by that time. They had taken a lot of hits up there.

26:03.291 --> 26:07.715
They needed something to pump their own people up 
and say, hey, come on, take some more of this. It's

26:08.516 --> 26:09.697
going to be worth it. We were the only thing that 
they had to show for their efforts. Supposedly,

26:17.485 --> 26:23.552
they were accomplishing a lot in South Vietnam, 
but it wasn't anything that people could look at.

26:24.753 --> 26:28.697
But they could look at us, and we were their 
victories. So they took probably what amounted to

26:30.112 --> 26:38.319
about half the prisoners. I never bothered to try 
to quantify it, but about half what they had at that

26:38.579 --> 26:43.444
time. They handcuffed us in pairs, separated each 
pair. We were just walking in files, one pair

26:49.229 --> 26:58.937
behind the next, separated each pair by probably, 
oh, initially eight or 10 yards. When the parade

27:00.267 --> 27:09.577
first started off, the sidewalk was really 
crowded, but the people there didn't know what to

27:00.267 --> 27:09.577
do. It was just kind of this very awkward,

27:10.638 --> 27:23.612
kind of an incomprehensible, well, yeah, I see, 
but what do I do? Silence. So we were unblindfolded

27:25.754 --> 27:28.317
at this time. There was a North Vietnamese guard on 
each side of a pair, one of our prison guards. They

27:34.924 --> 27:38.908
had their rifles with them. Then it was very easy to 
pick out who were the instigators, the local

27:38.989 --> 27:47.058
political leaders. And they'd start some kind of 
yell. It was like a cheer. And they'd turn around

27:52.484 --> 27:56.329
and the people behind them, yeah, yeah, me too, me 
too. And you could see this whole thing then get

27:56.663 --> 28:01.208
started that way. And it was slow getting started. 
But once it got started, it really boiled over. And

28:08.937 --> 28:13.302
it's a long story in and of itself. But by the time we 
finished, I really didn't think we were going to

28:13.823 --> 28:19.570
get out alive. I really didn't. They were throwing 
rocks, bricks, whatever they could. They were

28:26.009 --> 28:28.192
trying to mob us. And before the parade ended, the 
guards that were there to make sure we stayed in our

28:28.212 --> 28:41.491
place as prisoners were literally using their 
rifles to protect us in the crowd. Rifle butts, the

28:43.113 --> 28:47.319
barrel of the rifle, whatever they could. They 
didn't shoot anybody that I saw. But the guards and

28:50.583 --> 28:54.289
the officers were doing the same thing. It was very 
apparent. that the whole thing got completely out

28:55.878 --> 29:01.363
of hand, and they weren't ready to handle it. And a 
lot of our guys took a lot of bumps and bruises, but

29:01.383 --> 29:12.333
that was all the physical damage that we suffered 
from it. I don't know how long it lasted. It seemed

29:14.616 --> 29:17.058
like it was a couple of weeks. It was probably about 
an hour and a half, two hours at the most. And that

29:21.442 --> 29:24.805
kind of thing never happened again as a result. 
They threatened it a number of times, at least

29:25.156 --> 29:30.461
within the prison system. Interrogators 
threatened us, but it never happened again. And

29:33.484 --> 29:39.770
how did North Vietnamese interpret this to the 
world, their version of it? It was just their proof

29:41.792 --> 29:46.015
of ongoing victory. See just a sampling of the many 
hundreds of American flyers that we've captured.

29:54.907 --> 29:58.692
which is the result of the many thousands of 
airplanes we shot down. And I forget to, we figured

29:59.994 --> 30:10.247
out a pretty accurate ratio

29:59.994 --> 30:10.247
of the number of planes they actually shot down to 
what they claimed. I forget right now what it was,

30:10.307 --> 30:18.638
but it was somewhere between six and ten to one 
planes per actuals. Slightly exaggerated. Yes,

30:20.221 --> 30:22.183
oh yeah. Okay, well, Within the camp itself, you 
talked about you were kept in various size

30:23.257 --> 30:33.169
compartments, from solitary to 50. Can you 
discuss a few of those? Perhaps the solitary, that

30:37.494 --> 30:40.858
was at the beginning of your term, correct? Yeah. 
First of all, most of the places that we stayed,

30:50.240 --> 31:16.737
uh several of the places where prisoners were kept 
were not designed as prisons to begin

30:50.240 --> 31:16.737
one of the biggest apparently had been a french 
film studio and i spent several months there

30:50.240 --> 31:16.737
several years there as it accumulated over the 
time that's where i spent about the first six

30:50.240 --> 31:16.737
months in solitary confinement i was two weeks in 
the Hanoi Hilton in the section we called

31:18.083 --> 31:21.868
Heartbreak Hotel. Then was taken to, we called it 
Camp A at that time. And spent the better part of the

31:31.620 --> 31:35.384
next six months there. My cell was, for the most 
part, was a large room with windows that had bars in

31:38.028 --> 31:46.538
it. and shutters on the outside of the windows so I 
couldn't look out. The bed was a bunch of boards

31:52.011 --> 32:01.381
nailed together and

31:52.011 --> 32:01.381
sat directly on the floor. I was given some string 
to tie a mosquito net up over there, tie the string

32:03.323 --> 32:12.673
to the bars on the windows and at least give me a 
place to stay out on mosquitoes at night. I had a

32:13.314 --> 32:16.457
room probably initially as big as this room. Which 
is about? Oh, what, 16 feet square, something like

32:20.603 --> 32:24.448
that, roughly. So it wasn't the small cell that I 
would imagine. Not initially. But this was just

32:30.436 --> 32:34.802
because they were looking for places to keep us. 
They weren't prepared to handle prisoners of war.

32:39.228 --> 32:42.292
They hadn't planned for that logistically. So 
initially that was a big room. I had it all to

32:44.737 --> 32:45.818
myself. The only furniture was a bed and a tin 
bucket over in the corner that had a wooden lid that

32:45.838 --> 32:54.007
sat on the top that was my toilet. How did you, did 
you make use of this area then for what physical

32:54.928 --> 32:59.833
exercise? Did you, I was going to talk about the 
different ways you basically exercise both

33:01.555 --> 33:07.742
mentally and physically. Yes. You can take them in 
either order you want. I'm assuming that you

33:10.765 --> 33:13.528
started to communicate with people next to you or 
did you wait until you got back to the Hanoi Hilton?

33:18.569 --> 33:24.598
Okay, the primary communication tool was what we 
came to call a tap code. Are you familiar with what

33:24.618 --> 33:26.822
that is? Right. Okay, you know how that works then. 
The North Vietnamese really helped us out a lot in

33:30.908 --> 33:34.594
passing that tap code around. When I was still at 
Heartbreak Hotel, I was taken to another room for

33:36.136 --> 33:42.486
interrogation. was left there to kind of cool my 
heels and apparently make me nervous for a while.

33:48.982 --> 33:50.784
Sat in front of this desk on a stool. The desk was for 
the officer who was going to come interrogate me.

33:55.209 --> 33:57.331
And there wasn't anybody there, so I started 
looking around. And right square in the middle on

33:57.351 --> 34:03.178
the top of this desk, carved with a nail, was the 
matrix for the tap code. And a little note above it

34:03.698 --> 34:08.524
says, all American POWs learned this. And they 
didn't read English very well, I'm assuming. And,

34:12.168 --> 34:22.063
you know, some guy that had been there before me and 
had had time took his nail, and that was one of the

34:12.168 --> 34:22.063
primary tools we had, used it for almost 
everything. Eventually they figured that out,

34:22.444 --> 34:23.906
right? Yeah. And put it into at least the passing it 
around that way. Yes. But it got around. Everybody

34:32.380 --> 34:33.702
learned it. Let's see, I've lost track of what the 
question was. Well, I was going to say, how long did

34:37.472 --> 34:40.056
it take you to learn it? I mean, the first six months 
you were there, did someone initiate it next door

34:40.096 --> 34:43.942
to you? Well, I mentioned Jim Stopdale. Okay. And I 
had been in heartbreak about five minutes when he

34:49.911 --> 34:58.144
started talking to me. And, you know, filled me in 
very quickly on communication procedures. There

35:03.644 --> 35:06.267
were guys on the cells on either side. There were a 
total of six or seven in the heartbreak cell block

35:06.347 --> 35:11.895
at that time. We were able to communicate by 
talking fairly well in that situation. So I didn't

35:19.465 --> 35:24.732
have to use the tap code a lot until I got to another 
camp a couple weeks later. Was it very thin walls or

35:24.752 --> 35:28.377
through the window more? Most of the time, the 
walls were pretty thick. They would often leave a

35:33.528 --> 35:45.681
dead space, even in the walls between rooms, for 
insulation, especially in the prisons. I'm sure

35:45.981 --> 35:50.125
they did it to limit communications. But we 
finally reached the point, especially in the

35:51.186 --> 35:56.912
larger cells, where we had some other 
capabilities that we didn't when we were alone,

35:57.297 --> 36:05.829
one or two guys, of being able to talk through those 
walls verbally. You had to make sure you were

36:05.849 --> 36:11.818
secure as far as the North Vietnamese were 
concerned. But everybody came online very

36:11.838 --> 36:14.442
quickly. And as far as the ability and learning the 
skills we had there to communicate were

36:14.702 --> 36:21.792
concerned.

36:25.337 --> 36:27.220
That was one of our primary efforts. teaching new 
guys how to communicate and establishing initial

36:28.128 --> 36:37.179
communications with them was one of the things 
that everybody pulled out all the stops on. A lot of

36:38.641 --> 36:46.791
guys got caught communicating and knew that they 
were going to be tortured for it, knowing full well

36:38.641 --> 36:46.791
it was going to happen. But they went ahead and did 
it to establish initial communications with the

36:47.391 --> 36:51.176
new guys. And that kind of, just talking about 
that, I guess, signify the incredible importance

36:56.512 --> 36:59.535
of the communication. Yes. I was going to say, to 
retain your sanity in that entire situation,

36:59.835 --> 37:08.584
would you say that that would be one of the major, 
major aspects that got you through the whole

36:59.835 --> 37:08.584
thing? It was absolutely essential. It was very 
easy to tell when a guy had been even with a large

37:12.007 --> 37:25.540
group for a long time and taken out for just a week or 
two and held in solitary confinement while they

37:12.007 --> 37:25.540
were trying to lean on him for a war crimes 
confession or something like that. People

37:26.178 --> 37:37.988
alone tend to get out of balance, at least as far as 
society is concerned. We need each other to say,

37:38.008 --> 37:42.552
hey, you're great on most things, but that idea's 
crazy. Here's why. If you don't have somebody

37:44.474 --> 37:55.223
there to tell you that,

37:44.474 --> 37:55.223
it's very easy to avoid realizing that one idea out 
of 10 really is crazy. So we knew it was essential.

37:59.685 --> 38:07.796
We'd been trained beforehand in the survival 
schools that we'd gone through to communicate.

38:07.816 --> 38:10.459
Had they taught you any codes at all in the 
survival? That was an old Boy Scout code that some

38:10.920 --> 38:15.426
guy had brought in and said, hey, it'll work here. 
The Morse code didn't work as well there. This

38:21.394 --> 38:22.495
worked a lot better. It was a lot simpler. for what 
we had to work with. What kind of things besides

38:28.588 --> 38:31.171
names? I read that people memorize all the names of 
who was in their cell. What kind of things did you

38:36.078 --> 38:37.700
talk about? Was it mainly who is where and what's 
going on? Or was it, what kind of things would you

38:41.966 --> 38:44.709
talk about day to day? OK, the first priority was 
keeping track of prisoners. Who's been shot down

38:49.776 --> 38:54.302
that hasn't showed up yet that we need to be looking 
for? Who do we know that is alive that has been

38:55.750 --> 39:03.521
captured in custody of the North Vietnamese? 
Where are they? If they've been moved, where have

39:05.643 --> 39:07.586
they been moved to? If somebody's disappeared, 
then we gotta figure out what happened to them.

39:14.455 --> 39:15.797
That was the first priority. The second priority 
was a combination of finding out what the

39:15.817 --> 39:25.150
Vietnamese were currently about Usually the way 
they worked would be a single purpose purge.

39:35.477 --> 39:36.839
They'd go through the whole camp. This week it's 
going to be war crimes confessions. Next week it's

39:41.386 --> 39:44.991
going to be apologies to the camp commander for 
communicating. It can be anything. Sometimes it

39:50.259 --> 39:52.723
was military information. We wanted to find out 
what the current purge was about. Frequently that

39:56.557 --> 40:06.407
was the situation and just knowing what they were 
going to be looking for helped us get better

39:56.557 --> 40:06.407
prepared. I was going to say prepare yourself 
mentally. Yeah. It was a combination of figuring

40:10.411 --> 40:19.521
out what the North Vietnamese were about and 
getting direction from the senior officers. So

40:20.480 --> 40:23.404
the military chain of command, was it somewhat 
intact? It was absolutely intact. Incredibly,

40:25.608 --> 40:26.449
wow. How did that, were there actual orders going? 
Okay, the second thing you found out about a guy

40:29.754 --> 40:41.211
once you got his name and identified him was his 
rank and date of rank to know where he fitted into

40:29.754 --> 40:41.211
the chain of command. And you might have one boss 
one day and a new guy gets shot down and you got a new

40:42.173 --> 40:47.601
boss the next day. they were smart enough to say, 
okay, who's been running this thing? What are the

40:51.008 --> 40:55.415
policies that the Americans have had up at this 
point and why? And I'll get on board from there and

40:56.296 --> 40:59.101
make changes slowly. How did everybody react to 
that? Was there ever an incident of, I really don't

41:01.545 --> 41:06.412
care what he says, I'm just going to do my own thing? 
Or was there an overall bond, a unity of, hey, if we

41:06.432 --> 41:13.063
don't stick together, we're not going to make it 
kind of thing? I would say there were some When you

41:16.960 --> 41:32.533
leave people in that kind of situation where you 
have aggravations coming from every side for long

41:16.960 --> 41:32.533
enough, you're going to get some anger, some 
disappointment, some disagreement, and it'll be

41:16.960 --> 41:32.533
vocalized. But

41:33.414 --> 41:46.765
my experience for the whole seven years there was 
there was never any doubt about what our

41:33.414 --> 41:46.765
responsibility was. If we were senior, we were to 
take command. If we were not senior, we were to fill

41:50.206 --> 41:54.711
our place in the chain of command, whatever that 
might be. So it worked probably better there than

41:55.572 --> 42:00.598
it does here. It was more important there that we 
follow that chain of command for a number of

42:01.599 --> 42:08.287
reasons. And we did. The kind of... Maybe the type 
of activities you underwent maybe in the cell by

42:14.555 --> 42:18.680
yourself. I've heard stories about mental type of 
activities. Someone who would imagine that he was

42:21.903 --> 42:26.709
building a house. And it would go nail by nail by 
nail. Or somebody else would do math problems over

42:29.071 --> 42:34.257
and over and over and just work their mind that way. 
What kind of things did you do to keep your mind

42:34.918 --> 42:36.860
busy? Well, first of all, physical exercise was 
important. And we did that. to a man, as far as I

42:45.031 --> 42:46.513
know.

42:50.598 --> 42:54.684
The amount of that that we could do depended on the 
diet. When we were getting bread, we could do

42:56.065 --> 42:57.547
better. When we were getting rice, we couldn't do 
as well. And it was very obvious in that kind of a

43:00.031 --> 43:02.834
situation. But almost everybody had some kind of a 
personal plan of physical exercise. And it was

43:09.623 --> 43:12.507
just about a daily routine.

43:14.039 --> 43:17.845
For the mental activities, there was a lot more 
variation there. It depended on the situation. If

43:20.468 --> 43:25.636
you were alone, you had to play solitaire, 
whatever form that might take. If you were in a

43:26.497 --> 43:43.843
large group like we were toward the end and had more 
open communications, we had formal classes in

43:26.497 --> 43:43.843
science, humanities, foreign languages, math, 
just about anything you could think of. A friend of

43:44.903 --> 44:09.477
mine who was one of the few pilots shot down who did 
not have a degree came home after the war, went to

43:44.903 --> 44:09.477
get his degree, and was able to validate almost 25 
credits, semester hours credit, just because of

43:44.903 --> 44:09.477
the quote courses, unquote, that he took in North 
Vietnam. Such as? What kind of courses were the

44:13.502 --> 44:16.186
standard? Language, math, science.

44:20.072 --> 44:21.895
Those were probably the most useful. We had one guy 
in a cell that I was in toward the end there who had

44:21.915 --> 44:32.110
been a

44:21.915 --> 44:32.110
thermodynamics instructor at the Air Force 
Academy. So we had a lot of capability there. I

44:36.577 --> 44:38.620
taught some classes on French,

44:39.899 --> 44:49.329
chemistry, a little bit of math, and bridge. Now 
how did the guards react to this? Because you said

44:52.012 --> 45:00.681
at the beginning they were a little, they weren't, 
you know, they didn't really encourage the

44:52.012 --> 45:00.681
communication at all, but then towards the, this 
was what, in the early 70s? Yeah,

45:02.363 --> 45:08.149
70, late 71 and thereafter. Mm-hmm. late 70 and 
thereafter.

45:13.523 --> 45:15.767
And at that point they didn't really mind? They did 
mind, but they

45:15.827 --> 45:27.207
were in a bind then.

45:31.335 --> 45:33.278
Let's see. It's been a long time, Barbara, since 
I've done any thinking about this, so I'm a little

45:33.713 --> 45:45.230
off on, I'm a little fuzzy on my timing, but several 
things happened

45:33.713 --> 45:45.230
toward the end of the 60s. Two were extremely 
important. One was the families of those who were

45:49.957 --> 46:00.132
prisoners or were missing finally got together 
and began communicating with each other. Up to

46:00.152 --> 46:02.455
that point, the U.S. government had made a very 
concerted effort to keep them isolated from each

46:02.671 --> 46:06.677
other. It was a dumb policy. President Nixon 
changed that. And the families got together and

46:12.666 --> 46:24.523
organized their own efforts, saying, hey, the 
government has been able to do absolutely

46:12.666 --> 46:24.523
nothing, including they haven't been able to stop 
the torture. Is this where the letter-writing

46:26.566 --> 46:29.451
campaign began? Among other things. Writing 
letters, bracelets, Bonnie can tell you volumes

46:32.725 --> 46:42.979
about that because she was right in the middle of 
getting it organized and carrying it out. But all

46:44.901 --> 47:00.322
of a sudden the North Vietnamese realized that 
they were making Americans as a nation mad at them

46:44.901 --> 47:00.322
because of the way they were treating us. Up to that 
point America as a nation had been divided on

47:03.083 --> 47:10.832
everything that pertained to the war.
