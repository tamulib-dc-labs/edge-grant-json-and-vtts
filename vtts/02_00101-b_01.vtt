WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:07.765
Any important, any famous people through SCONA? 
No. Who were the, do you remember some of the

00:09.107 --> 00:10.869
speakers? No, I just remember they were 
congressmen or senators, but I don't remember who

00:11.250 --> 00:15.315
they were. Because somewhere about that time, 
Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee came, I remember

00:15.516 --> 00:21.484
that. Could very well be. about that time, and I 
remember he was very pleasant and personable and

00:22.205 --> 00:27.077
so forth. I just attended the evening programs 
where they had speakers and things like that. Did

00:34.034 --> 00:40.263
you become involved as a SCONA worker or anything? 
No.

00:43.447 --> 00:48.814
And you, would you and your buddies go over and hang 
out a little bit in the MSC? Yes. There wasn't a lot

00:51.919 --> 00:53.741
of time though. The day was pretty well taken up. 
And like you said earlier, you took a lot more

00:55.003 --> 00:58.488
hours. And so you were in class a good deal today, or 
labs. And the science courses you were taking,

01:01.692 --> 01:06.039
every one of them had a four-hour lab. Guyen Hall, 
did you remember going to any movies or activities

01:07.742 --> 01:11.488
in Guyen Hall? Yes. Describe what went on during a 
movie when Aggies were in the audience in Guyen

01:12.770 --> 01:17.558
Hall. Well, if there was any slight mention of sex 
or anything like that, they kind of would whoop and

01:18.213 --> 01:26.507
carry on like, you know, banjis and things like 
that. Because they used to be, the campus theater

01:26.787 --> 01:33.118
used to have the Friday night groads, groad flex 
they were called. Oh, I don't know what to describe

01:33.478 --> 01:35.682
that. Well, there was a series of films that 
showed. It was called Mr. Peepers, as I remember.

01:44.380 --> 01:51.113
And just for all of these women wearing bikinis and 
other things like that. I mean, nudity to the

01:51.133 --> 01:54.480
degree it's allowed today wasn't allowed. And 
they were just walking around doing things. And so

01:56.787 --> 02:02.115
you were going and watching, you know, skint, 
partially clad women. And they were called the

02:02.976 --> 02:05.820
Grove Flex. And it was, they were never officially 
announced. It was just kind of word got out that

02:08.284 --> 02:15.073
Friday night at the campus theater was Grove Flex 
were going on. And I remember old Schumann would

02:15.094 --> 02:17.497
stand out there. He just took a dollar from 
everybody coming in the door, you know. Were these

02:20.982 --> 02:22.324
late? Oh yeah, they started like 11, 12 o'clock at 
night. And it would be filled with an all-meal? Oh

02:29.634 --> 02:30.475
yeah. And what noises were made during the flicks? 
Animals.

02:38.168 --> 02:42.294
And lots of whooping and carrying on and stuff like 
that, yeah. Did anybody take drinks in there? Not

02:45.187 --> 02:48.852
that I'm not an alcoholic, not that I know of. You 
probably wouldn't have got away with that. They

02:50.234 --> 02:51.896
were going to sell you a Coke. That was part of the 
reason for the movie is that you can sell popcorn,

02:51.917 --> 02:57.484
you know.

02:59.047 --> 03:00.869
And let's see, religious activities. Did you take 
part in any? Yeah, at St. Mary's, you know, the...

03:05.956 --> 03:09.962
Describe that, because we don't, I don't know much 
about what was the... Well, you know, you were

03:10.263 --> 03:23.462
still in that age where you went to church every 
Sunday, and you'd go to church over there, and

03:10.263 --> 03:23.462
then, you know, maybe some involvement, once 
again, with the Newman Club, the Catholic student

03:10.263 --> 03:23.462
organization. They would have some maybe social 
activities afterwards or dances, and like I said,

03:23.522 --> 03:36.861
that's where I met this girl from Houston who, she 
was a, you know, I came from a very large family with

03:23.522 --> 03:36.861
children, There were seven boys and two girls in 
the family. Her family was like seven girls and two

03:41.271 --> 03:43.797
boys. And so it was, I don't know, that's... Was 
there a Sunday night event? No. When did Newman

03:53.398 --> 03:54.681
Club meet? Well, maybe there were some evening 
things, yeah. But I guess it was evening. Yeah.

04:01.314 --> 04:06.002
During the weekdays, could you go over there to 
kind of escape from the corps? Well, I didn't. You

04:06.803 --> 04:07.184
didn't? Yeah. There may have been some of that. Was 
there a campus, a Catholic chaplain kind of

04:09.067 --> 04:16.939
somebody that you all would go to? Occasionally, 
yeah, and he used to figure I would come around and

04:16.919 --> 04:20.624
visit people in the dorm room. Oh, he would? Well, 
the priest would, yeah. Oh, really? I didn't...

04:23.047 --> 04:32.440
Well, we're talking about, you know, six, seven 
thousand students at A&M in total, you know,

04:23.047 --> 04:32.440
graduate and everything, I think, probably not 
much more than that. And, yeah, you know, if he

04:32.480 --> 04:40.311
became active in that, he would come by and 
occasionally somebody I know would organize that

04:40.291 --> 04:46.240
the priest was coming over and we'd get together in 
a room and maybe he'd talk about things. As far as

04:48.323 --> 05:05.387
you can recall, describe the A&M student body at 
that time in terms of attitude, economics,

04:48.323 --> 05:05.387
geographic background, ethnicity and so forth, 
religious attitudes and so forth. Well, there are

05:05.367 --> 05:12.476
no blacks, a few Hispanics, very few, primarily 
Anglo, of course all male. I think it was a pretty

05:14.058 --> 05:17.443
diverse group in a sense of economics. There was a 
lot of, you know, some very wealthy kids and also

05:17.963 --> 05:25.453
some very, you know, poor kids as well, you know. 
Where were they from geographically? I think all

05:28.337 --> 05:30.579
over the state, even then. Were there many out of 
staters, out of country? Very few. As I recall,

05:35.978 --> 05:41.327
there was one guy, Fish Yaskovic, from Yonkers, 
New York. So we went out to one of these drinking in

05:42.870 --> 05:45.595
the woods one night. I still remember Yaskovic got 
out of the car and he looked up and he says, Jesus

05:45.815 --> 05:55.472
Christ, you guys got a lot more stars in Texas than 
we do in New York. Anyway,

05:57.207 --> 06:04.474
very few out of state students. One kid, you know, 
he came to A&M not, he wanted to be a veteran, you

06:04.514 --> 06:16.086
know, and his family had been involved in a lot of 
horse racing in Delaware, I believe. He was from

06:16.106 --> 06:16.887
Delaware. And he came to A&M not knowing that it was 
all male. Because he said, and he showed us, they

06:22.553 --> 06:25.980
sent him these brochures. And they had pictures of 
women that was, of course, taking social events or

06:26.681 --> 06:32.413
summer school or some other time. And he didn't 
know what he was getting into. The basic attitudes

06:34.177 --> 06:39.628
of these students, liberal, conservative? I 
don't know that, you know. that there was that much

06:44.795 --> 06:48.240
politics discussed, quite frankly. There was an 
anti-letting women in, and that sort of thing. And

07:01.737 --> 07:08.406
the same sort of tunnel vision that even probably 
more so, even a mild criticism would result in

07:08.386 --> 07:17.157
someone suggesting that Highway 6 ran both 
directions, you know, and if you don't like it, you

07:08.386 --> 07:17.157
can leave. Of course, they were still saying that a 
lot when I came back on the faculty. Were there any

07:20.742 --> 07:22.224
Jewish kids, you remember? There may have been a 
few, but

07:23.345 --> 07:28.933
I'm not sure. Basically, were, was everybody 
accepted by and large, was it an inclusive or an

07:36.449 --> 07:40.114
exclusive group? Well, I think it was inclusive. I 
think it probably still is in the sense that Aggies

07:40.956 --> 07:45.362
pull together and that kind of thing. I know we had 
one kid one time that went over to snook to the SPJST

07:45.843 --> 07:56.879
hall and got into a fight and was arrested. He 
fought a local boy, so they arrested him, not the

07:58.201 --> 08:02.146
other guy that beat him up. And so we had to go get him 
out of jail. And I finally got, you know, found out

08:06.132 --> 08:23.415
where he was, and he said, well, you have to go see 
the J.P. And so he takes us down to the J.P.'s house,

08:06.132 --> 08:23.415
you know, and we have this hearing, and there's 
this light hanging from a bulb, and the damn thing

08:06.132 --> 08:23.415
is swinging back and forth. The police officer 
explains what happened, you know, and the judge

08:23.395 --> 08:30.410
says, guilty, you know. I mean, he doesn't even get 
a chance to get, this guy wants to get back to bed.

08:35.500 --> 08:41.252
And anyway, so many dollars, and everybody 
pitches in. Bails this guy out so he doesn't have to

08:41.232 --> 08:44.215
spend the night in jail.

08:47.198 --> 08:52.023
Now did you guys on Saturdays go to Snoop to eat 
kolaches? I didn't. The bakery I don't think was

08:52.363 --> 08:53.625
there. If it was, I didn't know about it. I didn't 
know about it by then, if it was. Later we would

08:57.749 --> 08:59.370
discover it, of course. Yeah. You know, there was 
this dance hall over there, and it was the SPJST,

09:01.312 --> 09:06.598
the thing. And you would go over there and it was... 
They had these bleachers along the sides of the

09:11.978 --> 09:14.904
thing. And there would be these old Czech women 
sitting in there. I guess they were sort of the

09:18.731 --> 09:20.455
chaperones. And there might be some local girls 
that would come out and dance. But they were

09:25.565 --> 09:28.030
watched very closely by these. these elderly 
women. And it was all, I call it the Winthorpe

09:29.773 --> 09:35.184
shuffle, but it was really the Texas two-step. But 
in Wichita Falls we were just too damn

09:35.224 --> 09:40.775
sophisticated for that stuff, you know, and then 
doing that kind of dance. We did the real dancing.

09:44.242 --> 09:44.382
Anyway. The

09:46.066 --> 09:57.337
other student organizations, how did you and your 
buddies feel about the singing cadets and the

09:46.066 --> 09:57.337
Aggie band and things like that? What prestige?

10:01.928 --> 10:02.328
I don't know. I mean, everybody loved the band, you 
know. They used to say, well, have a football team

10:04.231 --> 10:08.176
the band can be proud of someday. And, of course, 
the Ross Volunteers were considered a really

10:08.236 --> 10:15.865
elite group that somebody got into that that, you 
know. There was probably more competition for

10:15.965 --> 10:19.810
that then than there is now by ten times. Was it a big 
deal to be a yell leader then? Oh, yeah. Sure. What

10:23.755 --> 10:27.700
was the sublime student leadership role? What do 
you mean by that? If you could have had any student

10:31.217 --> 10:37.746
leadership position, what would have been the one 
that was most respected? Oh, company commander.

10:40.650 --> 10:42.072
Or corps commander, I presume. Well, yeah, but the 
really big deal was the company commander, more so

10:42.112 --> 10:54.289
than I think it is today, that the guys that got to be 
company commanders were the kind of, at least

10:42.112 --> 10:54.289
within that group. Now, going to corps staff was 
obviously a a very prestigious thing to happen to

10:56.873 --> 10:59.395
you. And of course, you got picked your junior 
year. Corps staff was picked in the junior year.

11:05.100 --> 11:10.384
Were you and your buddies aware of elected student 
body officers much? Well, yeah. You were marched

11:11.285 --> 11:14.348
over as a company and told how to vote. Oh, really? 
Oh, yeah. Had voting machines that were the old

11:15.929 --> 11:17.710
lever. Only time I've ever seen them except when I 
was in Maryland graduate school. You went in and

11:21.534 --> 11:24.937
you were told how to vote and who to vote for. I think 
they still do some of that. But the student body

11:27.147 --> 11:31.313
president did not rank at all. Oh, no. Now, if you 
were a student body president, yeah, I guess that

11:33.576 --> 11:41.348
was an important position. I don't mean to say it 
wasn't, but not as corps commander was God. Were

11:47.336 --> 11:52.203
you aware in those days of any secret 
fraternities? No. There may have been some, but I

11:54.326 --> 11:56.209
wasn't aware of them. So far, I've only had one 
person admit that he knew they existed. Well, I

12:02.737 --> 12:04.499
literally don't know. They may have. But there's 
some others that I know were members that I've

12:06.442 --> 12:10.247
interviewed. There's a yearbook in 32 or 
something that has the swastikas in the corner and

12:10.748 --> 12:17.817
Wayne Stark. It goes way back before that. What was 
this called? The stickers, the swastikas. And

12:26.870 --> 12:28.232
they discovered that. You see, that was a Navajo 
symbol. They discovered that long before the Nazi

12:30.715 --> 12:33.120
Party had. Is that right? Yeah. I knew it was a novel 
symbol. I think Mr. Evans was a sticker. Is that

12:40.296 --> 12:40.937
right? The two that I know of were the TTs, the 
something Texans. Tough Texans. True Texans.

12:49.601 --> 12:50.202
True Texans. True Texans, yeah. And the 
swastikas. And as far as I can determine, the only

12:55.831 --> 13:07.269
purpose they had at all was to see that one of their 
group was the corps commander and the head deal

12:55.831 --> 13:07.269
leader. In other words, it was to get their little 
clique. The local party. Yeah, it was a political

13:10.895 --> 13:12.117
party. And there was nothing ulterior or 
anything. Now, Harrington, he cracks down on

13:14.520 --> 13:16.762
them. Is that right? Yeah, in the 50s, early 50s, 
late 40s, and kicks two or three out of school

13:18.324 --> 13:25.253
because they denied it. Well, if there was any of 
that going on when I was a student, I was completely

13:25.533 --> 13:29.058
unaware. But that's entirely possible, too. 
Let's see.

13:37.186 --> 13:43.936
There are no veterans coming back, so that's not an 
appropriate question for me to ask you. You

13:45.037 --> 13:46.419
mentioned that summer job. Did A&M help you get 
that veterinary? No. I'd worked for them when I was

13:50.065 --> 13:53.209
in high school originally. And then after your 
second year, you have decided not to do veteran

13:53.930 --> 14:06.028
medicine, and you go back to Midwestern for your 
senior year? Yeah, and then I had another year

14:06.008 --> 14:08.551
after that. Because I really got way behind, you 
know.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.063
Let's see, back to the community. How often did you 
and your buddies go to Bryan? Oh, very seldom.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.572
Because you didn't do much shopping. No. And did 
you go down there to a movie? Yeah, occasionally to

14:29.178 --> 14:32.991
the old Bryan Theater in downtown Bryan. Was there 
any area of Bryan where supposedly something

14:33.392 --> 14:40.977
illicit or extreme went on? If there was, I didn't 
know about it. I've never heard any stories about

14:43.005 --> 14:44.988
gambling. There was a place where they served 
family-style meals. In fact, it was still going

14:48.512 --> 14:50.435
when I came back. I forget the name. A big old 
boarding house. Yeah, that thing. And they had

14:54.220 --> 15:00.388
lots of home-cooked stuff, everything fried or 
boiled, you know. And you go down there and for, I

15:00.408 --> 15:04.793
don't know, $3 or $4, you could eat all you wanted. I 
remember Linda and I, after we came back, I went

15:05.114 --> 15:08.398
there a couple of times. It's still going. I don't 
know what it is anymore. What about J.E. Lupo? Did

15:13.745 --> 15:14.666
you meet him? Mm-hmm. Describe him and what kind of 
guy he was. Well, I know I needed a slide rule

15:20.073 --> 15:31.348
because I couldn't get through all these math and 
problems and everything, and particularly the

15:20.073 --> 15:31.348
long division and the time necessary to finish the 
test. And I'd learned how to use a slide reel in high

15:31.328 --> 15:33.631
school. And so I went over there to buy one. And I was 
looking at what he had. And I didn't have enough

15:39.419 --> 15:43.685
money to get any of them. And he said to me, what's 
wrong with that? And I said, well, I just don't have

15:48.131 --> 15:49.453
that much money. He said, well, how much can you 
pay? And I told him, he said, sold. And his

15:54.585 --> 16:06.077
daughter, who's a very good friend of mine now, her 
husband did his master's thesis under me and

15:54.585 --> 16:06.077
Artie.

16:06.057 --> 16:10.525
She's bought the stores from her brother, and so I 
see her all the time. She's really upset about all

16:10.585 --> 16:16.455
this off-street parking stuff in Northgate now 
and is down. She lives in Austin, but she's here two

16:16.515 --> 16:22.005
or three days a week and has a house on Gilchrist 
just down from me. So, you know, I told her that

16:22.526 --> 16:26.894
story one time, and she said, yeah, the dad did that 
a lot. Did you ever hear anything negative about

16:27.915 --> 16:30.580
Lupo? Well, I think they used to say, old Army Lou, 
he'll screw you. But did you ever hear of him

16:36.649 --> 16:38.672
jipping anybody? No. I think it was just a catchy 
phrase. And I heard him say a number of times that he

16:43.378 --> 16:50.827
had never loaned a snaggy money, that he didn't get 
it paid back. And I've never heard anybody else,

16:55.433 --> 17:02.244
just like you, that if they were broke and needed a 
book or a piece of equipment, he always helped

16:55.433 --> 17:02.244
them. Pinky Downs. I don't know that I knew Pinky 
when I was a student here. When I came back, and

17:08.253 --> 17:15.024
maybe I did because I don't, but Pinky was still 
hanging around, the official greeter. Describe

17:16.005 --> 17:18.589
him in that role. What did he do and where and how? 
Well, he hung around the MSC and greeted people and

17:21.961 --> 17:27.128
talked about how great the Aggies were. And like 
there's an old joke they would tell, he sees a

17:27.308 --> 17:33.977
funeral as he's traveling along. And he stops and 
gets out and goes over and stands there. And the

17:37.622 --> 17:42.028
preacher says, well, does anybody have anything 
they'd like to say about the deceased? nobody

17:42.008 --> 18:08.758
speaks up so pinky down says in that case could i say 
a few words about a m and i'm sure you've heard that

17:42.008 --> 18:08.758
that uh apocryphal tale before but i always 
thought he was sort of a joke quite frankly i mean

17:42.008 --> 18:08.758
you like uh and he made a really big deal about being 
this official greeter and his house which is right

17:42.008 --> 18:08.758
over on the corner of yeah it's right there where uh 
Anyway, I know where it is. But he had a sign out in

18:11.933 --> 18:17.010
the front yard, Pinky Downs, official breeder of 
A&M or something. And I learned not long ago that he

18:17.176 --> 18:26.064
was a, then they called him directors, now we'd 
call it regent, in the 20s, in the early 1920s. Is

18:26.224 --> 18:27.365
that right? See, his family was in banking in 
Temple. And I think during the Depression, I think

18:32.069 --> 18:36.253
the bank collapsed. And I don't know whether it was 
mismanagement or what. Did you, during your

18:40.517 --> 18:46.322
student days, did you ever see Earl Rudder in any 
way? I'm sure I probably saw him at ceremonies and

18:47.315 --> 18:53.806
final review, you know. What did you and the 
students think of him in those days? I think

18:58.675 --> 19:00.338
everybody was pretty much afraid of him. I think he 
was respected, you know.

19:05.767 --> 19:09.053
What about Dean Hannigan, dean of students? I 
don't think I had any encounters with Hannigan. I

19:12.578 --> 19:15.645
got to know him when I was a faculty member. He 
helped, you know, I got to know him when I first came

19:16.207 --> 19:19.715
here. I started helping to get people to create the 
Aggie Sailing Club, get that started. That's how I

19:25.148 --> 19:26.490
got to know him. And then in 72, this is really 
interesting in itself, is that he asked me to be a

19:26.851 --> 19:34.161
chair of the Yell Eater and Bonfire Committee. And 
I served from 72 to 76 as chair of that committee.

19:39.009 --> 19:43.275
And this is the interesting part about it. He was 
concerned about bonfire safety and a lot of the

19:43.407 --> 19:50.213
horseplay and the stuff that was going on and the 
drinking. And he said, the problem I have, he said,

19:50.293 --> 19:56.519
we've had people that have been involved in my 
office that have chaired that committee. And they

19:57.159 --> 20:00.182
get too close to these students and they let them 
get away with things. And what I want is a faculty

20:00.242 --> 20:01.823
committee. He asked me to recommend some other 
people to serve on it. And I want a faculty

20:05.546 --> 20:09.690
committee that will have some independent 
oversight of these kids. Well, I found out that was

20:09.730 --> 20:11.912
almost impossible. to do. But you know how I 
replaced the chair of the committee? Who? Malin

20:15.557 --> 20:16.620
Sutherland. My, my. And Malin wasn't a faculty 
member. No, he was a staff member. Yeah, yeah. But

20:22.990 --> 20:36.247
that's why I say he went, Hannigan went from having 
a committee dominated by the MSC student programs

20:22.990 --> 20:36.247
office type people or the dean of students office 
to a faculty committee. Do you know what Malin's,

20:36.847 --> 20:44.397
what the students nicknamed him, he was a tech 
officer, the nickname for him was the Slink. Yeah,

20:44.377 --> 20:45.460
I can believe that. That he slinked around. But, 
you know, he's really kind of taken on the same role

20:48.468 --> 20:54.143
that Coldis had, which is that of a permissive 
parent. And that's part of what went wrong with

20:54.946 --> 20:56.851
Bonfire. And I'm amazed that he's going to be in 
charge of the committee to restructure it.

21:01.927 --> 21:08.200
Anyway,

21:01.927 --> 21:08.200
but no, I thought I had a lot of respect for 
Hannigan. He was a gruff, general type guy, but I

21:08.260 --> 21:15.294
think he knew the score on Bonfire and he knew there 
was a problem. And what's really interesting, you

21:15.515 --> 21:19.463
know, what the problem If you read that report, the 
red pot system is what was the corrupt influence in

21:19.443 --> 21:24.309
Bonfire. Well, I resigned in 76 because Coldis 
would override the committee recommendations.

21:30.576 --> 21:34.661
We'd make some recommendations about things 
about, one was the length of time they could work on

21:30.576 --> 21:34.661
it. We tried to shorten the days you could work on 
it. And it was concern about academic

21:38.505 --> 21:43.531
considerations and other things. Coldis 
overrode us. And that's when I resigned. And I

21:46.514 --> 21:47.575
wrote him a letter. I can't find it. I threw it away. 
or I gave it to maybe whoever left it with the

21:49.210 --> 21:54.014
Bonfire Committee records. But I basically told 
him that the Red Pot system was corrupt, and that

21:54.795 --> 22:09.608
self-selection was going to get him in big trouble 
down the road, and that the Bonfire Committee

21:54.795 --> 22:09.608
ought to be the one that picked the Red Pot, the 
all-eaters. Let's jump back. I'm sorry. No, no.

22:11.870 --> 22:14.632
Did you jump work on Bonfire when you worked on 
Bonfire? Oh, yeah. Describe that. Oh, that was a

22:16.194 --> 22:17.014
great time. Where? You go out in the woods and cut 
trees down. Where was the cutting area? I don't

22:22.472 --> 22:22.974
know. Somewhere in Brazos County, but I couldn't 
begin to tell you. And with what did you cut? Well,

22:27.432 --> 22:28.634
we didn't cut anything. Juniors and seniors cut. 
Freshmen and sophomores picked logs up and

22:31.357 --> 22:37.405
carried them out of the woods and put them on trucks 
or laid them down. And that's another thing is that

22:38.106 --> 22:42.571
freshmen and sophomores didn't work on the stack 
either. And that was true when I was chair of that

22:43.292 --> 22:45.235
committee. And half the people that were killed or 
injured were freshmen. And about how long did

22:50.441 --> 22:53.305
y'all, did you work on? Well, a couple of days. 
That's all? The two-day thing. Yeah, it wasn't the

22:57.289 --> 22:58.952
length of time. Well, you look at those pictures 
that are in the Bonfire Report. It's not the

23:02.319 --> 23:08.211
gigantic, massive thing that it became, really, 
in the 60s. Where was it held? This thing behind

23:09.374 --> 23:11.458
Duncan. It was already behind Duncan. It was 
already behind Duncan. A couple of days, and then,

23:13.923 --> 23:23.659
let's see, no, the Kennedy interruption comes 
after you're gone. Yeah, that's the year I'm gone.

23:26.443 --> 23:31.491
And let's see, other, I'm trying to think, oh, 
final review. You must have gone through final

23:32.853 --> 23:35.237
review twice. What were your recollections of 
that? Well, it's an emotional thing, you know,

23:38.763 --> 23:52.395
particularly, you know, the ceremony of it, the 
seniors leaving, you know, and the new guys

23:38.763 --> 23:52.395
getting their boots on and marching around again. 
So your second year, you're a junior who is not, do

23:52.515 --> 23:59.281
you know that you're not going to come back your 
senior year? So you didn't put on any senior boots.

24:04.867 --> 24:06.548
Did you go through the second? Yeah, but I just 
didn't have boots And

24:08.750 --> 24:16.805
no family and special people came down to watch or 
anything. Did you go to commencements? No, I don't

24:20.572 --> 24:21.554
think we did. I don't recall ever going to a 
commencement.

24:27.667 --> 24:30.570
I remember the commissioning ceremonies. But 
they were generally held in conjunction with

24:32.031 --> 24:34.973
final review. People were given their . Were there 
any important speakers that you remember that

24:38.537 --> 24:49.987
came to the campus, whether it be for muster or 
commissioning or any? If there were, I don't

24:50.007 --> 24:50.888
remember. You don't remember? No great 
celebrities? No. Did you go to muster? Oh, yeah.

24:56.232 --> 24:57.133
Where was it held? As I recall, I think in the Grove. 
What did you think about Muster? I don't know that I

25:05.538 --> 25:08.501
had any great reflections of it at the time. I don't 
think it was as big a deal then as it is now, at least

25:08.521 --> 25:13.327
not here. I can't find it. It's not filling up Reed 
Arena like it is now. I haven't found many people

25:19.633 --> 25:27.542
that remember going to, knowing anything about 
Muster until World War II. muster changes during

25:27.522 --> 25:29.645
World War II. Is that right? Immediately after. 
Bonfire goes from being trash to being logs, so

25:32.089 --> 25:40.081
that society in many ways changed. I'm not saying 
that's good or bad. The first one where you really

25:41.884 --> 25:48.754
see where it's predominantly logs and you don't 
see the trash is the year they made the movie We've

25:41.884 --> 25:48.754
Never Been Licked. I think that's right. And they 
needed it as a backdrop. You know, it plays a real

25:51.578 --> 26:00.793
prominent role when the Japanese students are 
breaking into the chemistry building, you know,

25:51.578 --> 26:00.793
to steal Pop Langer's secret formula for flexible 
steel. You know, think about it. Isn't that the

26:02.656 --> 26:07.804
corniest damn movie

26:02.656 --> 26:07.804
in the world? Let's see. Student indulgences. We 
talked about alcohol. What were students smoking

26:12.011 --> 26:14.134
then? Well, no, there wasn't any drug smoking 
going on. If there was, it may have been some of

26:17.258 --> 26:28.217
those Hispanic students from Mexico or South 
Texas that did it, but Lord, I mean, you could go to

26:17.258 --> 26:28.217
the state penitentiary for many years for smoking 
marijuana. What did you and your, what lingo did

26:28.317 --> 26:34.688
you know relative to drugs when you were an 
undergraduate? I don't, you know, there wasn't

26:34.668 --> 26:39.996
any, you know, drugs weren't a, I mean, hey, you 
could buy amphetamines. We used to have

26:40.016 --> 26:41.098
amphetamines. Had you heard the word heroin? Oh, 
yeah. You had? Yeah. Well, I remember seeing

26:45.645 --> 26:50.272
Reefer Madness in high school, you know, and just 
being scared to death. And what, according to that

26:50.432 --> 26:54.939
movie, what happened to people who smoked 
marijuana? They just absolutely went insane,

26:55.219 --> 27:00.507
jumped out of the windows and other things like 
that. You know, I don't remember the movie having a

27:00.487 --> 27:13.475
real lot of impact, but I remember when I was in 
graduate school at Maryland, they used to show it

27:00.487 --> 27:13.475
as a camp film, and then people would go down and 
make fun of it and smoke marijuana. That was later

27:13.856 --> 27:15.399
on, you know. But when I was an undergraduate, you 
know, there... I don't know of anybody that had

27:18.205 --> 27:21.671
marijuana or anything like that. Had you ever seen 
marijuana? No. And certainly not heroin.

27:27.281 --> 27:32.310
Smoking, what percentage you think of the 
undergraduates smoked then? A large percentage

27:32.931 --> 27:34.674
smoked cigarettes. What were the popular brands? 
Winston,

27:38.422 --> 27:45.895
Paul Maul, Lucky Strikes, I guess, Camels. If you 
were really, really macho, you smoked Camels,

27:46.576 --> 27:51.604
unfiltered Camels. And cigars? Some, but not 
much. Pipes? Yeah. I think the pipes were kind of in

27:58.155 --> 28:02.022
a tent to be a little more sophisticated. What 
about faculty members? Did they smoke some? I

28:05.808 --> 28:08.212
remember one guy in economics who smoked in class. 
Who? I don't recall his name. I'm trying to

28:14.042 --> 28:16.326
remember. He was in Nagel Hall. Everybody in 
social science was, I guess, right? I certainly

28:23.107 --> 28:29.373
remember faculty members who smoked in their 
offices, so that was certainly true. Were there

28:31.436 --> 28:37.302
any campus celebrities at that time, any people, 
any student body? There weren't any great

28:38.643 --> 28:42.947
athletes that everybody noticed in there or 
anything, were there? No. What about Aggie

28:45.270 --> 28:46.691
basketball? Did you go to the games? Did they play? 
I don't remember ever going to the games. You

28:52.157 --> 28:53.879
didn't go to G. Raleigh? I don't remember. Maybe I 
did. I don't remember. Because, see, it was

28:55.621 --> 28:56.982
packed. I might have to, you know, as a virgin. I 
don't like basketball. I'm not a big basketball

29:01.287 --> 29:02.728
fan. Right. Now, we're getting near the end of the 
questions that I had thought of. What have we left

29:07.713 --> 29:09.696
out that we should have covered? We haven't so far. 
I don't know. We covered a lot. A lot of things I

29:13.119 --> 29:16.603
never had thought about in years.

29:23.047 --> 29:24.008
I can't think of anything. I see. Well, I should ask 
an obvious question. Why did you not come back here

29:27.433 --> 29:30.097
your senior year? Why did you go? Well, part of it 
was that there was financial problems. My parents

29:37.989 --> 29:43.177
felt that you weren't going to be a veterinarian. 
That little place across the street was just fine.

29:47.263 --> 29:50.247
And so there was no financial support to help from 
them. Anyway. And for what I wanted to do, it was

29:52.190 --> 29:56.416
probably a pretty good school. And I had been there 
and knew people, so it wasn't like you were, I

29:56.456 --> 30:08.173
thought maybe at some point you might

29:56.456 --> 30:08.173
go back to A&M, but anyway. In fact, when I came back 
as a faculty member, I never even considered it

30:09.034 --> 30:16.425
until my dissertation advisor invited me over to 
her house and I met Bill Gibbons. You remember

30:18.785 --> 30:20.769
Bill, the first chair? He was a very impressive 
guy. It had been pretty low on my list of places to

30:23.033 --> 30:25.637
go. I hadn't thought about Bill Gibbons. I don't 
know what happened to him. I don't either. So when

30:33.391 --> 30:37.738
you left, you weren't leaving to get away from A&M? 
To some degree, yeah. I think so.

30:42.443 --> 30:45.127
I mean, some of the, it's sort of mixed feelings 
about it, you know. There are aspects of it that,

30:45.147 --> 30:51.456
you know, there's always somebody harassing your 
butt, you know. Admittedly, senior year, that

30:51.856 --> 30:54.440
wouldn't be as much. It'd just be the military 
officers. But, you know, and it's not a real, it

30:58.105 --> 31:02.311
wasn't a real pleasant place to be. I mean, you 
know, there's all military, lots of marching. No

31:06.524 --> 31:07.285
girls. I mean, what more could a guy ask for, you 
know? Now, your second year you had a car. Yeah. How

31:14.511 --> 31:17.334
often did you go back home? Oh, just at, you know, 
Thanksgiving and Christmas. And Easter? Yeah.

31:22.939 --> 31:23.439
Spring break? We didn't have spring break. We had 
Easter. No, but, I mean, that's it. That's about

31:28.544 --> 31:29.124
it. How often did you go anywhere else out of Brazos 
County? Well, except for going maybe a court trip

31:36.511 --> 31:39.407
or something, you didn't. There wasn't much time.
