WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:16.973
Do you remember any special speakers, any 
important campus celebrities coming to visit the

00:03.001 --> 00:16.973
campus during your student days? The president, 
the governor, a general?

00:24.219 --> 00:25.040
They probably did. But you don't? But right now, 
there's nothing that jumps out.

00:30.604 --> 00:32.586
Nothing stands out at all. Commencement, where 
was it? Tell me about commencement, when you

00:35.887 --> 00:37.789
graduated. Commencement was over in G. Robin. And 
it was hot. And had the chairs on the floor. And the

00:44.399 --> 00:46.783
stage up on the end, down against the wall. And 
that's where commencement was held. Do you

00:49.727 --> 00:50.869
remember who the speaker was? No. I'm sure that 
somewhere I probably had that ceremony filed. My

00:55.876 --> 00:56.537
mother did. Who came for you? Well, my mom and my 
daddy came. And my daddy had some sisters, and they

01:02.992 --> 01:06.395
were very close to me. And one of my favorite aunt, 
my oldest aunt, came down there. She had lost her

01:10.619 --> 01:13.082
husband, and she came and brought her boy. And I 
think that was it. I don't remember my brothers.

01:17.946 --> 01:18.727
They probably were. And you attended? Everybody 
attended graduation. I don't know of anybody that

01:22.491 --> 01:25.474
didn't go to graduation. Name was called, and 
hands were shaking. I guess, because I just don't

01:27.656 --> 01:31.159
remember people not being there. The

01:31.696 --> 01:40.356
student organizations, what were the important 
student organizations that you remember? Well

01:40.376 --> 01:49.738
the schools had theirs and they had a fishing game 
club and I was not real active in that but I went. The

01:51.119 --> 01:52.201
schools had those. The Hometown Club, in my 
experience, was the big, big organization. They

01:56.988 --> 01:58.309
had others. What about band, scene cadets? Oh, 
yeah. I don't remember scene cadets. Clearly, if

02:02.896 --> 02:10.747
you said that you know for a fact that scene cadets 
were there, I would say not for a fact, but I'm

02:02.896 --> 02:10.747
almost sure they were. I'm virtually certain of 
it. Band, of course, has always been a big thing.

02:16.015 --> 02:16.536
Always been. Corps cadets was the predominant 
thing there. What was the most prestigious...

02:21.899 --> 02:26.645
student office, student position? Oh, probably 
Cadet Colonel Coole. That's the one everybody

02:29.749 --> 02:31.872
knew Auburn knew. And what were the other? 
Probably President's student body, although

02:35.316 --> 02:39.642
frankly, I don't recall who that was.

02:44.448 --> 02:45.730
Head yell leader? Head yell leader, of course, 
was, yell leaders were all known. Head yell

02:49.060 --> 02:52.824
leader, you know, that's exactly why I wasn't 
thinking of that. Yell leaders were just the, just

02:52.844 --> 02:55.387
that. The student body followed them. You know, 
they'd give directions and everybody would

02:57.729 --> 02:59.611
follow. A lot of authority given to those guys in 
those days. I mean, I'm talking about crowd

03:03.295 --> 03:08.060
control, anything like that. They did a great job. 
Let's see, describe, since the, Aggie football

03:12.862 --> 03:15.706
team's doing pretty well in those years. Well, 
they didn't do so well when I was there. It was after

03:17.068 --> 03:17.969
I left. I mean, right before I got there. Barry 
Bryant was there. He left the semester. I mean, he

03:21.454 --> 03:22.596
coached the last semester. That's what I thought, 
yeah. My first semester. He coached that team. The

03:25.280 --> 03:25.881
57th. And they did do great that year. They lost 
three games that year. Describe a typical Aggie

03:30.127 --> 03:35.535
football, home football Saturday. Well, if you 
were lucky, you had a date down there. And I had some

03:38.519 --> 03:40.222
dates to football games. Always a big weekend. 
Looking forward to that. They sold the Aggie mugs.

03:44.444 --> 03:45.205
Remember those deals? They'd go to the TAM or 
something. You basically always got one of those.

03:49.472 --> 03:50.253
They weren't expensive. I don't know what they 
cost, but you got one of those. Girls would come in

03:52.817 --> 03:57.484
either in car, which is not uncommon. I mean, they 
came in as groups, you know, something like that.

04:00.608 --> 04:04.014
Commonly, we would pick girls up the train at North 
Zooch. Had one guy that had a car, an old one, and the

04:04.034 --> 04:09.582
back door was tied closed with a rope. And the car's 
name was Old Blue. We'd get in Old Blue and take off

04:11.824 --> 04:14.307
up there on Friday. And the train was always late. 
We'd try to get back from Midnight Yale and step

04:15.988 --> 04:18.470
over to Grove. Pick those girls up at North Sage and 
take off back down there to Midnight Yale. And then

04:24.336 --> 04:28.800
there was a place, we'd a lot of times go up to Falcon 
Lounge or the old Bryan Air Base. There was a place

04:28.820 --> 04:32.002
up in that club up there called Falcon Lounge. We'd 
end up going up there. We'd get them usually rooms

04:33.424 --> 04:39.349
over at the Sabre Motel somewhere around North, 
not North Gate, East Gate of that area. And they'd

04:39.515 --> 04:41.297
stay up there. Now was it the responsibility of the 
Aggie to pay that room? Oh everything. The Aggie

04:48.765 --> 04:49.907
paid it all. We split it up or whatever. And gosh it 
may cost $7 a night. Did many people have tessie

04:53.691 --> 04:57.675
dates? You know they did. I've heard about writing 
a blind date. That was not unusual to go to a town and

05:04.996 --> 05:09.221
show up and you know somebody to get dates for. You 
went to Austin several times. Somebody had a car or

05:11.665 --> 05:16.371
even hitchhike over there and see some T-Cit 
friend and get dates over there. And one old boy met

05:17.092 --> 05:19.915
some girls that worked at a telephone company. I 
mean, we went to holler one Saturday afternoon,

05:19.955 --> 05:23.019
let's go to Austin. I had, I think, one sport coat 
and one pair of pants or something like that. We

05:27.225 --> 05:34.294
took off over there and dated some girls that 
worked at a telephone company and drove back the

05:27.225 --> 05:34.294
next morning before daylight or something. 
Tessie's were, they came to campus a lot. Guys that

05:37.719 --> 05:46.947
come to Dallas for the football game, TCU, Fort 
Worth, and Dallas over there, it was not rare to go

05:37.719 --> 05:46.947
up to North Texas, walk in the dorm and sit with 
three of us here and watch the Bates. And then the

05:46.967 --> 05:50.289
girls come downstairs and they sort of pick them 
out, you know. That was not unusual. Tell me about

05:54.633 --> 05:56.695
Midnight Yale practice. It was a great 
experience. A lot of Bates were there because of

05:58.997 --> 06:03.741
the football games, you know, we had them come in 
there. go to Midnight Yale. I'm not saying

06:06.894 --> 06:11.060
drinking was not a problem, but I remember it being 
a problem. I think today they'd be having trouble

06:11.080 --> 06:14.865
drinking there, and I don't know that it wasn't, 
but I remember thinking about that. But we'd go to

06:16.247 --> 06:19.212
the Grove, and Midnight Yale was a big thing to go 
to. All the girls wanted to go there, and it never

06:19.272 --> 06:22.737
occurred to us not to go to Midnight Yale practice. 
Just like silver taps or something, you would

06:22.817 --> 06:27.403
never consider not going to silver taps. It was 
just not done. But the Midnight Yales, you'd go to

06:29.226 --> 06:33.272
that, and after that we'd go out somewhere, and go 
to bed at all hours. Next morning, probably pick up

06:35.724 --> 06:41.129
those girls up and maybe, and probably go to Sabisa 
with them. Took her to Sabisa quite a bit. And ate

06:43.311 --> 06:44.292
over there. Didn't go to restaurants that much. 
Some, the Triangle or something maybe. But maybe

06:49.577 --> 06:51.538
for the football game, go there. Parents would 
come down sometime. You'd buy tickets and they'd

06:53.620 --> 06:55.562
go into Sabisa. We always kind of wanted to show it 
off. It was kind of cool. You know, call all that

06:58.845 --> 07:01.808
food by nicknames. Then on Saturday night, was 
there usually an organized campus social event on

07:01.990 --> 07:09.058
a Saturday night after a game? Probably was. I 
don't remember that. I don't remember going to

07:11.180 --> 07:12.162
that. We'd gather. You know, big groups would have 
dates down. Or maybe all get adjoining rooms at the

07:17.407 --> 07:20.811
holiday end. But down on Texas, there's some 
hotels along there, motels. And get several rooms

07:25.757 --> 07:27.018
together. We'd all go back over there. In the early 
part of the year, they'd have swimming pools. We'd

07:30.222 --> 07:31.103
go swimming. You know, spent some time together. 
Do you know anything about any, did you hear

07:34.873 --> 07:41.679
anything about secret fraternities? Well, 
that's not right. Back in those days, Judge

07:44.682 --> 07:48.746
McDonnell had ruled something out. It would be 
women admitted or something like that.

07:52.589 --> 07:55.011
Harrington was there and Rutter and those guys 
were there. There was a group called the Molds and

07:55.772 --> 07:59.115
they published the mole in the steam tunnels, an 
underground, literally, newspaper. And you'd

08:05.121 --> 08:09.367
find those things over by selling, you know, 
they'd be over there in stacks or whatever, and the

08:05.121 --> 08:09.367
mole would come out. It was a controversial 
student-published sheet, you know, like that.

08:18.239 --> 08:22.626
And it would, you know, want to hang the Harrington 
effigy or whatever they even did. Was the mole

08:22.766 --> 08:24.408
conservative? Ultra. So it was against any 
change. Any change, that's right. Any change at

08:29.492 --> 08:30.533
all. And we all got, it was a big laughing matter, 
got a kick out of it. Secret fraternities as such,

08:33.817 --> 08:37.562
though. I don't remember anything. Some of the 
people that I've chatted with so far have said yes,

08:39.785 --> 08:54.263
they thought there was the TTs, the True Texans, 
and that there were another group said they

08:39.785 --> 08:54.263
thought there was one called the Stickers. as in 
the last two syllables of swastika. And I have

08:59.887 --> 09:15.277
found that in old Longhorn yearbooks, remember 
that was the name until 48, quite often there was a

08:59.887 --> 09:15.277
swastika, long before Adolf Hitler used it, came 
from the Navajo symbolism for friendship. Right.

09:15.893 --> 09:18.596
and that there would be a swastika drawn on various 
things. I have no idea where they're... Now, if you

09:18.616 --> 09:22.481
ask me if I've heard of that, I have heard of those. 
But you don't... But I wasn't aware of anything

09:23.402 --> 09:25.004
like that. And if you ask me how long ago have you 
heard of this, I've heard of this since I've been on

09:25.044 --> 09:30.410
the board of the Association of Farmers. Okay. All 
right. I've even heard a few people go so far as to

09:31.111 --> 09:37.118
drop a couple of names that it'd be very surprising 
how profiled names they might have had to

09:31.111 --> 09:37.118
distance. I wouldn't dare repeat those because I 
wouldn't even know if that's the case or not. I

09:41.103 --> 09:44.247
don't know the implication of those secret 
fraternities. There have been indications of it.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.910
Back to the routine of social life. In all of these 
dances and midnight yell practices and so forth,

09:57.524 --> 10:01.729
non-regs, and corps members participate fully, 
equally? Probably not. I think that's the reason

10:02.971 --> 10:06.315
that I didn't have the experience with the 
organized things. Now, I'm not saying anybody's

10:06.896 --> 10:10.460
at fault here, except myself. I don't remember, 
for example, ever having gone to a cotton ball.

10:12.863 --> 10:13.965
It's a big thing in spring. The mate of cotton was 
chosen down there. Big thing. The beautiful girls

10:16.468 --> 10:17.790
would come by. We'd sit by and watch and lust, I 
guess, you know, and watch those pretty girls come

10:18.110 --> 10:23.958
by. And they had pictures in the annual, you know, 
so... Well, but I didn't participate in it. But you

10:29.064 --> 10:37.677
went to, y'all practiced, and you went to, and you 
and your buddies went to Senior Taps, to Silver

10:29.064 --> 10:37.677
Taps. Always. You participated in those things 
without fail.

10:44.147 --> 10:53.080
Let's see, no World War II, no back, were there some 
veterans there from Korea days that you remember?

10:53.515 --> 10:55.057
Some quote older guys? Yeah, they were in the 
wildlife department. We had some fellows that

10:57.020 --> 11:00.244
came back and were studying wildlife. They were 
veterans. As a matter of fact, there were quite a

11:00.885 --> 11:05.452
number of undergraduates who were veterans at 
that time. They were mainly day ducks. They were

11:09.277 --> 11:11.460
guys who had come back and lived off campus. Many 
were married by that time. Now, how did you learn

11:14.905 --> 11:16.587
Aggie slang? by osmosis? Well, probably not. 
Probably learned a lot of it, because like I say,

11:20.928 --> 11:26.095
when you decide to go to A&M, you start getting all 
this literature, you know. I mean, they'd come out

11:26.115 --> 11:28.218
and they probably had little booklets. I was aware 
of much of that when I got there, but for the most

11:28.719 --> 11:33.486
part, it was probably just exposure to the ones 
they got on campus. Quite a lot of trivia. You were

11:35.949 --> 11:38.092
in non-reg, you learned quite a lot of trivia. You 
weren't held accountable for it, but you were

11:38.413 --> 11:43.059
exposed to it. And, uh, that you were pretty 
doggone well versed as a non-reg down there

11:44.798 --> 12:10.890
because it was such a traditional closed society 
that you were around this stuff all the time and you

11:44.798 --> 12:10.890
know you were surrounded by core guys and other 
non-regs and it was just there wasn't you did not

11:44.798 --> 12:10.890
speak to each other you were good friends with 
those fellas spent a lot of time in that dorm room

11:44.798 --> 12:10.890
and stuff like that uh harrington was a senior 
administrator did you as a student have any

11:44.798 --> 12:10.890
interaction seeing I don't know. Did you have any 
impression? See him occasionally. He would be at

12:13.702 --> 12:14.644
things. He'd be at functions. I'm sure he 
occasionally would be at... What was your memory

12:15.465 --> 12:23.419
of his personality? He was regarded as probably a 
very starchy fellow in those days. Maybe

12:28.729 --> 12:30.111
controversially, though. Rudder was adored, of 
course, like you. You think he was adored even

12:32.860 --> 12:34.683
then? I think so. But he endeared himself. I mean, I 
had a, I was on crutches one time, I had a hurt foot,

12:37.446 --> 12:46.957
and I was walking along there on crutches, and it 
was raining, and a car pulled up over there by

12:37.446 --> 12:46.957
Salisa Hall. I was over in 16, and over close where 
the fountain is now. A car pulled up, the door

12:50.441 --> 12:59.271
opened, and I leaned down because I was ringing the 
way I try to handle those books and stuff, you know,

12:50.441 --> 12:59.271
out of that poncho. And President Lutter was 
there. He said, where are you going, son? I said,

13:04.248 --> 13:05.489
well, I'm trying to get to my dorm. He said, well, 
get in. I'll take you. I said, just right over

13:06.610 --> 13:07.431
there. He said, I'll take you. So I got in the car 
with him. We visited on the way over there. We sat

13:12.457 --> 13:13.177
down and visited a few times. Unusual. Unusual. 
That kind of a, maybe it wasn't unusual in those

13:15.260 --> 13:17.883
days. But I thought it, we're sitting here talking 
about 40 years later. I obviously remember. Was

13:25.431 --> 13:27.493
there a guy named Pinky Downs there then? Describe 
Pinky. Boy, he was quite a figure, I'm telling you.

13:36.214 --> 13:39.981
I think he wore an old black hat, kind of a flat 
brimmed hat, kind of a tall crown to it. He was an old

13:40.001 --> 13:42.505
man, didn't he? And he was everywhere. He was at 
yoke practices and football games and And I'll

13:49.808 --> 13:51.630
tell you, he was quite a character. The official 
greeter was what he was called. So in a lot of time

13:54.313 --> 13:58.417
around the all-face chapel, MSC, all through 
there, you'd see him. He'd come into the dorm. But

13:59.938 --> 14:00.679
you'd notice him. I mean, it's like Ichabod Crane 
showed up. You'd look up, and he was such an

14:02.381 --> 14:04.523
imposing guy. I wouldn't say imposing. 
Noticeable. But he was just ubiquitous. You know,

14:11.831 --> 14:13.813
piggy-downs on campus. J.E. Lupo? Oh, yeah. Love 
most of my books over there. Walk in, always spoke

14:18.985 --> 14:26.336
to everybody, give you a dollar for your 
friendship, and you buy a book, and he'd knock a

14:18.985 --> 14:26.336
dollar off or something like that. Always knew 
that, you know. But later on, I bought my vet school

14:28.038 --> 14:32.926
supplies and went from there. Interesting man. 
May never be another one like him. Now, I've heard

14:35.930 --> 14:40.737
that many students could buy things on credit from 
you. I didn't, but that was done many times. Hired a

14:43.541 --> 14:45.364
lot of students. Let student organizations that 
sold instruments, for example, vet school, get

14:45.665 --> 14:53.444
supplies, I think, through himself. Like he told 
me one time, a long years ago, he said, I don't

14:53.464 --> 15:01.222
believe I've ever lost any money in student loans. 
I've heard he said that. Now, I didn't know Lupo.

15:04.801 --> 15:07.847
personally, like I know you even. We have visited 
many, many, many times, but all students just

15:07.907 --> 15:13.818
about at that day could say that. But when you got 
ready to go to A&M, you started getting your

15:14.218 --> 15:16.863
package in the mail. Lupo was there. I mean, his 
presence was high from that point on. He really did

15:22.193 --> 15:24.898
a great job of marketing himself down there. Let's 
see, other characters. There wasn't a dean of

15:28.257 --> 15:30.641
students then. There wasn't a John Coldis-like 
character, was there? There was a phone named

15:34.086 --> 15:36.069
Benny Zinn. Yeah, yeah, I forgot Benny. And Benny 
Zinn was a guy that you all, everybody knew about

15:37.431 --> 15:40.696
him. And I know we had a big water fight one time. 
You're not supposed to have those on water. He had a

15:46.745 --> 15:47.547
big water fight. He came over and walked around for 
a while. He said, I want this thing cleaned up, and I

15:50.792 --> 15:56.340
don't want this happening anymore because it'll 
catch anybody and kick them out of school, kind of

15:50.792 --> 15:56.340
like that. Also, we had a little bunch of, I 
remember vaguely, Pascoe, that we had some guys

15:57.299 --> 16:13.023
that registered at A&M that were just a little bit, 
I mean they were kind of a troublemaker, a liberal

15:57.299 --> 16:13.023
faction that came in and had an organization name, 
I think, that was national on college campuses.

16:13.844 --> 16:15.166
And I can't remember the name of that. Supposedly 
some of those guys registered before, moved into a

16:15.787 --> 16:19.813
dorm. Anything to be different, they would 
challenge everything. Rumor has it that a bunch of

16:25.582 --> 16:30.209
Aggies got those guys down to give them a GI shower. 
You know, got those brushes and just scrubbed them

16:30.229 --> 16:32.572
down real good. They even bathed that long hair, 
kind of one of those deals.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.644
Probably some of those guys, like Dr., I mean Mr. 
Rudder said at the steps, you'll have to get by this

16:40.704 --> 16:44.530
pot better than the president before you're going 
to do this. That attitude. And I think that Zen or

16:46.333 --> 16:50.739
somebody got over there and told him, said you are, 
you cannot do that. You are confined to this campus

16:50.759 --> 16:54.525
for the rest of the night. and nothing, in other 
words, a cursory approval almost. Those guys

17:02.831 --> 17:05.554
didn't stay. Let's see, other, Dean of 
Agriculture

17:05.634 --> 17:11.581
was there? Dr. Potts is such a prominent fellow in 
my mind. He was not Dean of Agriculture, but Dean of

17:14.044 --> 17:17.408
Agriculture I know was a big figure in those days. 
But you as a student didn't have it? As a student, I

17:23.272 --> 17:26.276
had nothing, no dealings with it. Let's see, 
describe Northgate. What was at Northgate?

17:31.963 --> 17:36.369
Probably, much like today, is one of the worst 
things on grade points you ever saw in your life.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.713
That was the nearest thing we had for commercial 
enterprise around there. You know, you always go

17:41.155 --> 17:42.737
to the post office. and go to the post office when 
there's no reason in the world not to go on over and

17:43.122 --> 17:46.425
get a cup of coffee. Go get a cup, as everybody said. 
There was no liquor store in that gate. And where

17:50.388 --> 17:52.570
would you get that coffee? Oh, there was a place 
called Godfrey's over there. The bookstores,

17:55.973 --> 17:58.555
there were two or three bookstores over there. The 
photo shop was in the corner. The boot store, the

18:01.237 --> 18:04.220
shoe store, sockage or whatever it was named. 
Hollick's? Hollick's, yeah, it was down there.

18:07.222 --> 18:12.707
Ellison Drug was on the corner right across over 
there in the south, I mean on the northwest corner.

18:13.042 --> 18:16.706
There was just a little strip along there. Campus 
Theater? Campus Theater was down the end, right

18:17.788 --> 18:20.111
across from the dorm. You notice my place is called 
Northgate. This is the other Northgate. But

18:24.696 --> 18:29.242
anyway, yeah, that was the exposure that you had to 
commercial enterprises. Rarely did you go to

18:29.422 --> 18:30.483
Bryan. I don't remember going to Bryan, not to 
sneeze at. Do you remember any, I think this is a

18:34.408 --> 18:41.597
question that doesn't have application to your 
years, Do you remember any major international or

18:42.067 --> 18:52.120
national events that caused you to kind of stop in 
your tracks and think about what it might mean to

18:42.067 --> 18:52.120
you? Sputnik. Oh, yeah. Sputnik jumps out. That's 
when that was, you know, it kind of shocked us in the

18:56.546 --> 19:01.993
reality that we're not necessarily on the cutting 
edge all the time on everything.

19:06.459 --> 19:10.504
Not international, but a national event was when 
Barry Lyon decided to go to the University of

19:06.459 --> 19:10.504
Alabama. Let's talk about Bear Bryant and 
football and so forth. Did you as a student, did you

19:17.681 --> 19:25.554
have any acquaintance or interaction with any of 
those sports heroes?

19:28.940 --> 19:30.923
Those guys were almost on another planet. I didn't 
have any interaction with them except for Tyler.

19:37.153 --> 19:39.296
He transferred to SMU, met a girl, transferred up 
there. Charlie Milstead was a classmate. And

19:42.060 --> 19:42.881
Charlie was there. He'd come to hometown club 
meetings sometimes. We knew each other vaguely. I

19:47.066 --> 19:47.947
went to high school with him. We didn't spend any 
time in the Corps. I was athletic and going on. I

19:51.372 --> 19:55.817
never went in the athletic block except just maybe 
walk in there or something. I didn't know athletes

19:55.837 --> 19:57.298
to speak of. Always had a great, great desire. I'll 
never forget it. The Letterman, in swimming and

20:01.223 --> 20:06.708
stuff, had those pretty white sweaters with that 
big maroon tee on it. And swimming across the top of

20:06.728 --> 20:08.530
that tee.

20:11.413 --> 20:15.778
I swam a lot because I was raised in State Park, a 
lifeguard, taught a lot of water safety and stuff.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.059
But I wasn't a competitive swimmer. But I had this 
great delusion. fantasized about swimming,

20:20.195 --> 20:23.942
maybe even talked about going over there. Now 
there's no way, there is no way that I look back that

20:23.962 --> 20:28.411
I would have done that. But I would have killed to 
have worn one of those sweaters across that

20:28.431 --> 20:31.717
campus. Because they meant, those guys were 
special because they were so dedicated to what

20:32.319 --> 20:37.208
they did. In those days, you know, the era of jocks 
were a big thing anyway. But we adored those guys. I

20:44.024 --> 20:45.266
mean, they gave us headlines. That's where we went 
and enjoyed ourselves, you know, football and

20:45.306 --> 20:48.752
stuff. Did y'all have the perception that those 
athletes went to class and everything? We had the

20:55.042 --> 20:56.745
perception they cheated a lot. We had the 
perception they stole quizzes. There was a guy

20:58.588 --> 21:02.655
named Murray Trimble, the one-armed guy that 
played down there that was infamous. I think he may

21:03.260 --> 21:06.505
have flunked out one time, but he came back. I 
remember seeing him. I just couldn't, he's tough,

21:07.546 --> 21:09.730
tough old boys. But that, we had, now, I wouldn't 
say that was universal. Charlie Milstead was a

21:13.996 --> 21:15.499
smart guy. He was an engineering major. I knew him 
from high school. I wouldn't say that it was, but we

21:18.303 --> 21:24.592
had the impression that those guys were cheap, you 
know, and stuff like that. That may be overstating

21:24.753 --> 21:26.155
that. What did people on campus think? You and your 
buddies think about Bear Bryant? Well, I was only

21:31.880 --> 21:34.604
exposed to him that one time. But, you know, he was a 
tough son of a gun. I watched practice with Slats a

21:36.607 --> 21:38.310
few times. I went to practice with Phil. And when 
somebody got hurt, I mean, he literally

21:39.912 --> 21:42.676
physically took them off. I mean, he drug them off. 
He'd get them out of the way. He was a tough son of a

21:45.300 --> 21:46.602
gun. And everybody knew it. When he left, we felt 
like we were going to be betrayed. I remember being

21:52.332 --> 21:53.634
sick about it. Because you could tell that guy was 
going to have something out there that

21:53.694 --> 21:58.581
everybody's afraid of. He had this mystique about 
him on campus and I think off campus.

22:05.111 --> 22:05.571
Let's see. See, we knew about Junction by then. 
Junction happened a couple of years earlier.

22:15.986 --> 22:19.892
Silver Taps as a student when you were there. What 
was it, where was it, and what were your feelings

22:20.378 --> 22:23.763
about Silver Taps? Silver Taps is a tradition 
that, for God's sake, I hope you never lose. I don't

22:33.698 --> 22:36.642
know that it's unique, but it is as far as I know. 
When I was a student, the tradition would adhere to

22:36.663 --> 22:40.328
the latter. You might hear rumors, you usually 
would hear rumors of maybe something like you

22:42.400 --> 22:48.349
killed in a car wreck or something like that. There 
were not that many of us. We're talking about 7,000

22:49.531 --> 22:54.458
people at the beginning of the year, you know, or 
maybe seven to eight. And

22:55.419 --> 23:03.011
most of the time, you would either know the person 
or would have met that person. And you certainly

23:03.031 --> 23:05.575
knew someone who knew that person, always. It was 
not a, unless you shipped it so far that you didn't

23:05.655 --> 23:10.602
relate to it very closely. So when you heard rumors 
of losing an Aggie somewhere, almost always you go

23:11.560 --> 23:19.228
to the flagpole at Sully's over in front of the 
academic building. They had that plaque over

23:19.248 --> 23:28.758
there, that bronze plaque, and it had the name of 
the person and when the ceremony was going to be or

23:19.248 --> 23:28.758
whatever, announcing that. Well, when the silver 
taps came, that was just what you did. You know, it

23:32.462 --> 23:39.169
came time, and you'd turn your lights out, walk out 
of the dorm, never say a word. And you'd hear those

23:39.189 --> 23:40.791
footsteps. some coughing or sneezing or 
whatever, but you never heard a word. It just was

23:45.491 --> 23:46.592
not done. And I don't know that I remember anybody 
in our dorm that never went to self-defense. I

23:52.760 --> 23:58.388
don't know that there was no one that did that, but I 
don't remember anybody doing that. You get over

23:58.408 --> 24:08.061
there, and of course it was an eerie thing, but also 
a religious experience because, you know, most

23:58.408 --> 24:08.061
religions teach us that relationships are 
important. And that's important to us. And you

24:10.275 --> 24:13.500
lost one of yours, and that was a real emotional 
thing. Coming back, you just gutted. You know, you

24:17.185 --> 24:27.239
just, but you were aware that this was a memorial 
thing and that you could be next. And you were

24:29.102 --> 24:31.184
reverent about that. And when we got back to the 
dorm, we didn't have the blankets up. and never

24:34.248 --> 24:35.710
turned any lights on. For the most part, we had the 
blankets up, but I wouldn't say we never turned the

24:35.730 --> 24:42.539
light on when we got back to going to finish 
studying or something like that. But for the most

24:42.559 --> 24:45.904
part, that wasn't the end of the day, for example, 
for us. But everybody went, and they were

24:46.384 --> 24:49.869
reverent. I had a chance to go to a silver tap. My son 
was at A&M. He finished in 92. I guess it was the fall

24:54.936 --> 24:56.939
of 91 or something. Went to a silver tap. Related to 
the student body, poorly attended. And of course,

25:03.323 --> 25:11.852
the commerce that goes on there, the roads and the 
highways out there, it was distracting because

25:03.323 --> 25:11.852
all that was going over on Welder and Road, things 
going on. There were noises. It used to be very

25:14.014 --> 25:15.075
quiet. It was silent. And you'd stand there with 
your thoughts until you heard the rifles and the

25:16.477 --> 25:22.303
vehicles and stuff. Did you go to Muster as a 
student? Went to Muster. And you know,

25:24.986 --> 25:29.371
interestingly enough, I don't remember details 
about Muster. Where was it held? The one that jumps

25:32.770 --> 25:37.696
out in my mind was on the lawn out by the NSC. They're 
the ones that I remember. Now,

25:39.939 --> 25:48.329
I met the guy who was president of the Association 
of Farmer Students the year in 1959. I'm sorry,

25:48.349 --> 25:54.577
I don't remember who he is. But anyway, I remember 
his face. I couldn't hear his name. that you had

25:57.914 --> 25:59.536
noted over there. But in any case, he was telling 
about that. And I remember vaguely, because

26:01.739 --> 26:07.628
Association of Former Students was just part of 
what you did next. Nothing was assumed, I guess,

26:08.789 --> 26:11.353
very much. But we were not presumptuous about 
much. When you graduated, you were going to be a

26:13.236 --> 26:15.138
former student. You were going to be active in the 
Association of Former Students, at least

26:15.158 --> 26:18.543
financially. Bonfire. Where? Over where it was 
until about three years ago, four years ago. Make

26:25.793 --> 26:26.875
believe. over by Duncan Hall over there south of 
Duncan. And how big was it and how did it get to be

26:31.906 --> 26:34.370
big? Well I don't remember how big it was. It's 
always seemed big to me. What was put in it? Was it

26:41.463 --> 26:42.705
trash? I don't remember trash. Might have been. I 
don't think it was. I remember it being logs always

26:46.271 --> 26:52.542
but the outhouse on top seemed like I remember that 
forever. Also, we had an Aggie that was either

26:53.956 --> 26:57.923
killed or got killed over there. Right before I got 
to A&M, this guy working, and he was standing

26:59.766 --> 27:06.858
behind a car, and everyone came along and hit him, 
and he was killed. That was kind of a, I remember

27:06.898 --> 27:12.488
that that was a thing that we remembered a lot about 
Bonfire. It was a situation where you want to be

27:12.608 --> 27:16.535
careful if somebody had been killed over there. 
The story's about, you know, the tea servers

27:18.188 --> 27:23.933
trying to bomb it, you know, and set it on fire, and 
you know, some imposter being in there, and all

27:18.188 --> 27:23.933
that stuff. But none of that happened during 
your... It didn't happen. I remember that that was

27:26.235 --> 27:32.480
talked about a lot, and it was a big thing we 
wouldn't dare to have, you know. But non-regs were

27:32.500 --> 27:40.307
probably not as involved in bonfire in those days 
as we might should have been. All right, Aggie

27:40.327 --> 27:43.289
Ring. What was the, what was the routine for 
getting your... Gosh, that's what you work for. I

27:48.783 --> 27:52.248
mean, when you got to A&M, you thought about your 
diploma after you got your Aggie ring. I don't

27:52.308 --> 27:55.813
remember spending a lot of time thinking about 
getting my degree. I spent time getting my hours

27:56.094 --> 27:59.358
for my autumn Aggie ring. And when you get that ring 
or when we got it, it wasn't a ceremony. Not like

28:04.305 --> 28:06.148
your association now. You go upstairs and cope 
with it. When you audit it and you go up there and get

28:07.936 --> 28:11.501
it, it's very uneventful, but you give them your 
ring. And of course, you get it out and you walk down

28:12.122 --> 28:15.067
those steps looking at it. You go to class, you 
couldn't even pay attention to what you were doing

28:15.087 --> 28:17.911
or watching your ring. Of course, it looked like 
everybody else's, and you thought everybody's

28:17.931 --> 28:20.676
looking at your ring. And it took a number of days to 
get past that, because you couldn't pay attention

28:20.796 --> 28:27.526
to what you were doing. And of course, that thing 
has been symbolic forever. How many people do we

28:30.150 --> 28:36.019
know because of that ring that you met somewhere 
here? What is Aggie spirit? Define it or explain

28:39.499 --> 28:40.862
it.

28:44.267 --> 28:52.100
Well,

28:44.267 --> 28:52.100
that's just that spiritual thing, the spiritual 
meaning of the soul. And I'm talking about things

28:52.721 --> 29:02.236
that make life more worth living. It has to do with 
relationships. And it has to do with what makes you

29:04.771 --> 29:08.216
care. And I don't know how you define that very 
well. There are things that make you passionate

29:09.618 --> 29:18.472
about things that other people don't have 
experiences, maybe, unless you weren't there.

29:18.492 --> 29:20.274
What causes it to happen, I don't know. It's the 
thing that we fear that will be lost. It's

29:23.559 --> 29:27.966
something that can be not explained, but it can be 
passed on. And it has to do with all these things we

29:30.229 --> 29:32.753
can talk about. And I am firmly convinced that had I 
gone to school anyplace else that I would have had a

29:33.492 --> 29:39.243
good education and had very good friends. But I am 
more convinced that I would have nothing like the

29:39.904 --> 29:44.512
life that I've lived. I am totally convinced of 
that. And I think most Aggies that have had an Aggie

29:46.215 --> 29:53.228
life like we have, you know, feel that way. It has to 
do with the legacy in your family. relationships

29:58.990 --> 30:01.776
all the way from the church that you go to. If 
somebody jumps out, I mean, you may go to, you may

30:01.876 --> 30:19.834
live, I say this at graduation sometimes, you may 
have gone to school somewhere, and you may live in a

30:01.876 --> 30:19.834
neighborhood, or you may go to church, or you may 
live in a workplace, they may know you went to

30:01.876 --> 30:19.834
college somewhere, but if you went there, they 
know you went to that state. And that is all part of

30:20.185 --> 30:23.410
that deal. That's the exterior part of it. There's 
more to it. There's something about it that makes

30:25.633 --> 30:31.781
it, that's the thing that makes it hard and 
miserable, that difference. Now, what is that? I

30:32.643 --> 30:34.585
don't know. Well, you've already gotten into that 
last question. I think I said in advance, what did

30:37.690 --> 30:42.316
it mean to you that you attended A&M? What effect 
did it have on you and your life? What feelings do

30:46.863 --> 30:49.787
you have in your heart for A&M today? Well, it's 
indescribable. The gratitude, the debt that you

30:52.112 --> 30:56.478
feel is more than it can describe. And obviously, I 
don't care how much money I ever made, if I gave it

30:56.678 --> 31:02.966
back, that would only be the financial part of it. 
It would never, ever begin to describe or repay

31:02.986 --> 31:08.052
what my life experience has been. It has meant that 
I've had a source of self-assurance and pride

31:08.933 --> 31:15.642
about who I am as a person. It has given me 
financial... ability in this life to far exceed

31:17.915 --> 31:24.639
anything beyond what you've ever dreamed of, 
ever, far, far. And I'm not a rich man in monetary

31:24.659 --> 31:28.051
terms. I'm comfortable with that.
