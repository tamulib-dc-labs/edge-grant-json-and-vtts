WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:11.365
sort of Pacific-wide, caused by things which 
occurred out in the Pacific when tape number two

00:01.533 --> 00:11.365
ran out suddenly.

00:14.168 --> 00:28.485
We were talking about a drought wide in the West 
caused possibly by occurrences out in the Pacific

00:14.168 --> 00:28.485
when tape ran out on site number two. And then I'll 
save that second side of the tape. I'll come back up

00:33.016 --> 00:34.558
here Monday afternoon. Okay, you will come back 
Monday afternoon? Yes, I sure will. I'm going to

00:39.746 --> 00:42.069
make sure that's right. Yes, it sure is right. Now, 
we were really talking about drought conditions.

00:49.660 --> 00:50.902
Oh, yeah. Are you on yet or not? I'm on. All right. 
What I was going to say was that this is a fairly rare

00:55.068 --> 01:00.295
event apparently, in essentially a 
climatological sense. It's either something

01:04.230 --> 01:11.919
that's occurred about once in the past century or 
maybe twice in the past century. So it's worth

01:11.939 --> 01:13.721
documenting. And I made some tentative sort of 
gestures to try and get some special observations

01:14.603 --> 01:27.839
made to essentially find out what was happening in 
the ocean under these unusual conditions. And I

01:27.859 --> 01:29.421
couldn't find anybody. who has had the ability or 
capability to do it, because everybody's

01:30.211 --> 01:35.981
committed to other programs. And this, I think, is 
very tragic in a way, that here's a good sort of

01:36.883 --> 01:49.485
scientific problem, and it has its practical 
aspects too, and yet you couldn't do anything

01:36.883 --> 01:49.485
about it. You know, as a matter of fact, people now 
are talking about more and more trying to tie

01:51.001 --> 01:58.970
together the work of the atmosphere and the work of 
the ocean. But it seems almost as if the

01:59.451 --> 02:04.537
departments are dividing whether they're coming 
closer together on these kinds of problems. Well,

02:05.438 --> 02:14.668
I don't see too many indications of them getting 
closer together. There is some interest. at the

02:20.397 --> 02:41.978
moment of some closer cooperation between what is 
called the Department of Atmospheric Sciences

02:20.397 --> 02:41.978
and Oceanography, but I think it just means that 
each will continue to do what it believes is its

02:20.397 --> 02:41.978
mission and they may get together now and again, 
not really a joint activity. And this is, I think

02:43.180 --> 02:49.746
it's most unfortunate because I

02:50.502 --> 03:11.022
don't think it's entirely a prejudiced point of 
view, but I think many of the meteorological

02:50.502 --> 03:11.022
events are, in effect, if not initiated, 
dominated by ocean conditions rather than the

02:50.502 --> 03:11.022
other way around. If we want to look at long-term, 
large-scale forecasting and so on, there's got to

03:12.384 --> 03:19.851
be more attention played to the characteristics 
of the ocean and there

03:20.472 --> 03:50.378
are some programs in other countries where there 
has been a much closer integration of the

03:20.472 --> 03:50.378
atmospheric and marine things and that's 
particularly true in Japan where one of the major

03:51.218 --> 04:00.071
oceanographic activities in Japan has been the 
meteorological service. But in this country it's

04:01.994 --> 04:14.211
traditionally been very, very difficult to get 
any sort of participation by the meteorologist as

04:01.994 --> 04:14.211
such in kind of oceanographic things. Now there 
are some exceptions, but the exceptions are are,

04:19.788 --> 04:23.673
in a sense, so few that they're kind of 
conspicuous. I

04:23.953 --> 04:29.379
ran across his name today. Nehmias is one person 
who has attempted to do this. Dr. Bjorkness at

04:37.449 --> 04:39.611
UCLA. But they're dealing more on a kind of a, 
almost a kind of climatic study type thing. Now, I

04:50.045 --> 04:59.622
have a series of questions, really, about, again, 
about government participation in the early

04:50.045 --> 04:59.622
organization of oceanography. Are there any 
congressmen or senators or administrations you

04:59.642 --> 05:08.998
would like to cite who forwarded oceanography as 
an academic discipline in the 40s and the 50s?

05:10.942 --> 05:14.989
Well, I think the...

05:17.568 --> 05:40.360
outstanding example is Senator Magnuson, who has 
for a number of years been very much involved with

05:17.568 --> 05:40.360
these things and is still very much involved, not 
just as a representative of our state, but as he's

05:17.568 --> 05:40.360
concerned about this national program.

05:44.005 --> 05:47.490
He is the only one, and I've had only very little 
limited set of contacts with him, but I've over the

05:48.061 --> 06:06.291
years gone by have had a fair amount of contact with 
his some of his staff, but not with in my case with

05:48.061 --> 06:06.291
any any others at all. We've never had a 
congressman from the state of Washington I don't

06:08.159 --> 06:31.635
think that has been interested and senator 
Jackson's interests have always been in other in

06:08.159 --> 06:31.635
other fields so professor the senator Magnuson is 
is the to my mind the number one here now if you talk

06:08.159 --> 06:31.635
to people from other parts of the country I'm sure 
you get other no he's always cited The only other

06:31.970 --> 06:38.457
exception is that frequently Vice President 
Humphrey is cited in Washington for offering

06:31.970 --> 06:38.457
special aid at one time or another. Well, he did, 
and particularly during this phase of the

06:38.477 --> 06:59.260
Stratton Commission, that's not his technical 
name, and so on, and he was very much involved in

06:38.477 --> 06:59.260
this, and of course we have on the campus here 
Professor Edward Wank, who's was one of the key

06:59.240 --> 07:07.471
people, not in the Stratton Commission, but in the 
Marine Council, which functioned at the same time

06:59.240 --> 07:07.471
as him. Is Ed Wink on the campus now? Do you want this 
on the tape? Yes. I'm not sure whether he's

07:14.661 --> 07:27.559
physically on the campus as of today or so, because 
he's been on a sabbatical leave this past year, but

07:14.661 --> 07:27.559
he has an appointment in engineering on the campus 
here, yeah.

07:31.353 --> 07:39.027
So he was supposed to be back this month, but I'm not 
sure whether he's back or not. We can certainly

07:39.047 --> 07:42.373
check up next week.

07:46.240 --> 07:50.548
I followed him from D.C. and halfway across the 
country trying to get in to see him. He's a hard man

07:50.889 --> 07:53.293
to get to see.

07:55.467 --> 08:05.782
Now, there's also been suggested that really the 
sudden boom in oceanography that occurs in the 50s

07:55.467 --> 08:05.782
comes as a result of the IGY activities. Would you 
agree with that? Well, I think IGY marked a change

08:08.966 --> 08:21.424
here in that this was, I think it's fair to say, 
about the first time that there had ever been funds

08:22.028 --> 08:33.638
available to a number of institutions for 
essentially a planned program of events. And

08:34.759 --> 08:52.035
I think part of the reason for some of the boom that 
followed that and the Indian Ocean Expedition was

08:52.403 --> 09:15.238
a case in point here, was the fact that there was a 
recognition on the part of the

08:52.403 --> 09:15.238
government that maybe science was a useful kind of 
diplomatic tool here, because this opened up

09:16.400 --> 09:29.493
communications with Russia, at least in some 
areas, and it turned out that oceanography was one

09:16.400 --> 09:29.493
of the better in the sense of exchange of 
information and sort of cooperation. Now under

09:29.594 --> 09:42.627
IGY there was supposed to be an effect of complete 
exchange, but it did not work at all because this

09:29.594 --> 09:42.627
represented the beginning of the space program 
and that sort of close, but it did keep the

09:42.843 --> 09:47.429
communications open in oceanography. And I am 
told that this is part of the reason why the

09:47.449 --> 10:00.484
decision was made to go with this Indian Ocean 
expedition, was to keep this kind of

09:47.449 --> 10:00.484
international contacts open. And the Indian 
Ocean was picked as essentially being neutral

10:01.606 --> 10:06.792
territory. And I think it has. And ever since that 
time, I think in oceanography, there has been a

10:09.074 --> 10:21.666
reasonable set of contacts between the Russian 
and American oceanographers. Now, it's not

10:21.686 --> 10:29.253
always what you'd like it to be, but at least the 
channels are open, if not very large. So I think it

10:30.815 --> 10:33.437
was a kind of political as much. The political 
implications may have essentially had an

10:34.514 --> 10:44.207
important place here. That's what I'm trying to 
say. It was not just the arguments of the

10:45.168 --> 10:51.676
scientists or anything that did this. There was 
more to it than that. There was a feeling. I don't

10:56.783 --> 10:59.887
know how widely it was felt. I sort of felt this way 
for a while. we might be, it might be possible and so

11:04.771 --> 11:20.012
on for the, as part of a kind of a national policy to 
divert some of the effort that went into the space

11:04.771 --> 11:20.012
program as it was being sort of phased down into the 
put me into the sea, but that never happened. As a

11:24.000 --> 11:33.515
matter of fact, I anticipate my next question is 
that an assumption, at least on part of the

11:24.000 --> 11:33.515
oceanographers, was exactly what you pointed 
out, that as space developed, then so would the

11:24.000 --> 11:33.515
ocean, too. Now, it didn't occur, obviously, as 
you pointed out. Now oceanographers are saying

11:37.661 --> 11:43.570
the 70s may be the decades of the ocean because of 
mariculture, aquaculture, mining for magnesium

11:44.545 --> 11:47.988
nodules and these sorts of things. Manganese. 
Manganese, I'm sorry. Manganese nodules. What

11:51.991 --> 11:53.212
are your feelings on that? Well, there's some 
curious things here which I think to a scientist

11:54.714 --> 12:13.810
are hard to rationalize, or maybe to anybody to 
rationalize, that there's obviously these

12:14.920 --> 12:22.889
things carry with them more than a kind of a 
rational approach. There's a question of people

12:22.969 --> 12:31.719
just getting interested in doing things, 
becoming aware of them. And also, it may be that

12:32.780 --> 12:44.353
certain things will be done not for economic 
justification, is a question of national

12:44.738 --> 12:55.084
prestige or turn it around because we want to help 
other countries or something. In other words,

12:55.165 --> 13:00.418
there's a variety of sort of elements involved 
here. I am not inspired by the aquaculture,

13:01.259 --> 13:12.695
mariculture thing, because I really don't see any 
great merit in it. But I will not say that there may

13:13.016 --> 13:19.846
not be major developments in this area. But it 
doesn't seem to me as a particularly

13:30.638 --> 13:32.860
major sort of enterprise. The reason is that it is, 
in effect, to cost labor and materials expensive.

13:41.289 --> 13:50.179
At the present time, the only possibilities in 
this area are for essentially very high-priced

13:41.289 --> 13:50.179
products. Now, this may be perfectly valid in a 
way, It doesn't really answer the question of

13:56.373 --> 14:01.240
feeding large numbers of people. My feeling is 
I'll let other people worry about these things.

14:11.755 --> 14:24.574
The manganese nodule thing is, again, I think very 
interesting in the way in that almost all of the

14:26.090 --> 14:37.340
uses of marine resources have developed out of a 
kind of traditional pattern over a fairly lengthy

14:26.090 --> 14:37.340
period of time, fishing as a case in point. But even 
in the petroleum business, the progress of the

14:37.360 --> 14:55.337
extension of this drilling and wells and recovery 
of petroleum and natural gas from beneath the

14:37.360 --> 14:55.337
seashore moved gradually from on land into very 
shallow water and then into deeper and deeper

14:55.756 --> 15:05.485
water so they could, in a sense, feel their way. 
This manganese nodules problem is to me

15:06.265 --> 15:18.756
interesting because of the fact that there was no 
technology in existence that could be modified or

15:06.265 --> 15:18.756
extended. It was a completely new kind of 
enterprise and it involved very major investment

15:25.473 --> 15:30.921
of capital with no assurance that it would work. 
And if they did work, whether it was economically

15:30.941 --> 15:35.848
feasible. And we don't know the answers to that. 
And I don't think we're going to know for some years

15:37.991 --> 15:42.037
yet. I think it's a good sort of thing to do, but

15:42.798 --> 15:52.813
it's

15:53.890 --> 15:59.898
But it is a sort of an interesting example of 
something that's more or less unique, I think. And

16:00.959 --> 16:04.523
it may not pay off for a long, long time. So you don't 
see these ideas attracting a vast amount of money,

16:05.745 --> 16:10.371
let's say, for the oceanography? No, no. This is 
what I tried to hedge on when I first started my

16:10.551 --> 16:21.585
comments here, that just interest may promote 
some of these things because people think it's

16:21.937 --> 16:28.366
interesting or think it's fun to do these sort of 
things. And, you know, who made the decision on the

16:29.348 --> 16:44.890
part of these companies that have invested large 
amounts of money in this manganese thing and, you

16:29.348 --> 16:44.890
know, what really tipped the scales they decided 
to go ahead with it. I don't think you can say it's

16:48.099 --> 16:53.790
really on the basis of rational analysis. It's 
just somebody got curious and interested. Now,

16:57.317 --> 17:05.292
you had pointed out, again another question I 
wanted to ask, that the IGY had spurred

16:57.317 --> 17:05.292
international cooperation. Some people are 
arguing now in terms of political geography that

17:05.660 --> 17:34.789
the sort of division up of the ocean with 200-mile 
limits, underdeveloped countries arguing that

17:05.660 --> 17:34.789
they're being exploited by oceanographers or 
oceanographic research at least, and

17:05.660 --> 17:34.789
international conferences of the sea will push 
American oceanography and other oceanographic

17:05.660 --> 17:34.789
research back into shore, away from the outer 
ocean, and complicate it for people in your

17:05.660 --> 17:34.789
profession. Would you agree with those sort of 
series of assumptions? Well, I think yes and no,

17:39.171 --> 18:05.974
but in that there are again sort of strange 
differences between the way in which people

17:39.171 --> 18:05.974
regard various parts of planet Earth here that 
have become so much a part of our kind of culture,

17:39.171 --> 18:05.974
they don't stop and realize that that there have 
been restraints in effect on what you can do on land

18:06.629 --> 18:17.645
for a long, long time here because of the whole 
concept of property rights. The atmosphere has

18:19.428 --> 18:23.614
another set of things that go with it. But even 
today, a country or even an individual has certain

18:23.755 --> 18:35.472
rights to the air column immediately over a piece 
of real estate. No airplanes are allowed to fly

18:36.143 --> 18:47.573
over a foreign area without permission from that 
particular country. And yet with the sea, because

18:48.193 --> 19:06.049
of different attitudes and traditions, we have 
this quite different picture that we used to call

18:48.193 --> 19:06.049
freedom of the seas and so on, that anybody could go 
anywhere, anytime, and do anything. Also, what

19:06.417 --> 19:22.061
was a very sort of arbitrary thing, although I 
think it had its basis in a very realistic sort of an

19:06.417 --> 19:22.061
approach of the territorial sea and the three mile 
limit as it's usually identified, although it was

19:06.417 --> 19:22.061
not always three miles. But this whole business of 
how do you deal with the ocean and a sense of kind of

19:22.122 --> 19:33.960
ownership and so on, certainly unresolved, and

19:34.396 --> 19:54.008
what's happening, as you indicated a moment ago, 
is that each coastal country is extending its

19:34.396 --> 19:54.008
interests seaward, and then the view of the 
underdeveloped countries and the landlocked

19:54.663 --> 20:09.305
countries and so on, that a large part of the ocean 
should never come under any individual country's

19:54.663 --> 20:09.305
control, but somehow or other ought to be for the 
benefit of all. And this

20:09.386 --> 20:18.159
is, as you are well aware, a subject of very hot 
debate here. There are fairly strong arguments in

20:22.810 --> 20:32.084
favor of some kind of dividing up of the ocean. Now, 
it could be divided up so that, say, the United

20:32.104 --> 20:38.354
Nations owns most of it. But if you remember your 
historical precedents, all sorts of interesting

20:39.135 --> 20:45.645
things happened at in England in particular, in 
what they call the enclosure acts, that when they

20:46.300 --> 21:05.828
went away from the concept of the common to 
essentially individual property rights, that

20:46.300 --> 21:05.828
the productivity of agriculture increased just 
tremendously under this change. It's often Cited

21:07.732 --> 21:15.634
as an example of horrible social injustice, but 
apparently this is altogether true. Apparently

21:15.955 --> 21:22.855
the poor people, in many cases, profited greatly 
from the enclosures. And I'm just out of reasoning

21:23.510 --> 21:34.563
by analogy here, but I think this fishery 
business, if there is some sense of ownership,

21:23.510 --> 21:34.563
then it's to your advantage to try and protect 
that. Whereas if it doesn't belong to anybody,

21:34.783 --> 21:40.870
they're just out there for whoever wants to take 
them and so on. The whales are probably the most

21:40.890 --> 21:52.183
newsworthy example of this at the moment.

21:52.838 --> 22:19.653
They feel, at the moment, that this 200-mile 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act will, in

21:52.838 --> 22:19.653
effect, have a very beneficial effect on, not just 
in the economic sense of how it may affect the

21:52.838 --> 22:19.653
fishermen of the United States and so on, but 
actually in the long-term kind of management of

21:52.838 --> 22:19.653
this resource for the benefit of everybody. I just 
don't know. I'm not too involved

22:23.062 --> 22:51.988
emotionally in this business about freedom of 
scientific research, although some of my peers

22:23.062 --> 22:51.988
are concerned in that I think there are many 
examples of where this is actually being abused in

22:23.062 --> 22:51.988
one way or another. We have a right to get slapped a 
little bit on it. This again gets you back into the

22:59.851 --> 23:11.668
subject that's come up several times of what is 
research and what isn't here, and that what is a

22:59.851 --> 23:11.668
research vessel and what isn't. And this is being 
debated because of the The vessels operated by the

23:18.310 --> 23:26.118
oil companies and some of these geophysical 
exploration companies want to call themselves

23:18.310 --> 23:26.118
research vessels. So from an outsider's point of 
view, what's the difference between a vessel

23:26.258 --> 23:37.250
operated by the University of Washington and one 
operated by us all? It's the same way our vessel, as

23:38.551 --> 23:45.398
far as a foreign country is concerned, is still 
looked on as a US Naval vessel. So here's the Navy

23:46.593 --> 23:48.395
coming in. And we keep saying, oh, we're doing 
basic research. And they say, yeah, but that's a

23:52.140 --> 23:58.407
Navy ship, as it legally is. So there are all kinds 
of, I think, examples here where it need to be sort

23:58.427 --> 24:04.775
of clarified. And my own feeling is, sure, it'd be 
fun to do research on other people's coastline and

24:05.996 --> 24:16.549
so on, not only from the kind of scientific 
interest of trying to help out these people. Then

24:16.917 --> 24:24.367
they have the argument, as well as nobody in their 
country that can sort of interpret the data, which

24:16.917 --> 24:24.367
is certainly true. So I think there's still plenty 
of ocean to look at, so I'm not too concerned at the

24:25.869 --> 24:34.181
moment. What about the environmentalist impact?

24:39.107 --> 24:41.531
I'm sorry, what do you mean? Well, what obligation 
do oceanographers have to to the

24:46.735 --> 24:53.883
environmentalist arguments which are 
developing very quickly and are involving

24:46.735 --> 24:53.883
oceanography as a discipline. Well, what— Sea 
pollution, for example. Yeah, let me back up here

24:59.530 --> 25:02.374
for a moment. I used to think I was an 
oceanographer, and as I've indicated to you, I had

25:02.454 --> 25:12.085
a very broad set of interests in terms of subject 
matter and so on. But in recent years, I don't even

25:12.554 --> 25:16.722
call myself an oceanographer. I call myself a 
marine environmental scientist because I've

25:16.882 --> 25:27.382
tried to sort of broaden out my interest. And I 
think we have sort of major responsibilities in a

25:27.402 --> 25:35.237
way to

25:37.040 --> 25:43.151
try and understand what the environment is and 
sort of identify some of the threats. But this gets

25:43.252 --> 25:57.799
me off into another long sort of story here in that, 
as I see it, most of the conflicts that are around us

25:43.252 --> 25:57.799
today here

25:58.505 --> 26:02.393
the battle between good and evil, in a sense. And 
it's a conflict between those who want to, in

26:03.094 --> 26:07.463
effect, exploit the ocean. And that means not only 
in terms of resources and so on, but even for waste

26:07.583 --> 26:19.146
disposal and so on, which becomes pollution here. 
this on one side, and on the other, the

26:19.936 --> 26:28.817
environmental concern, which in its broadest 
sense is a very recent sort of thing. I think it only

26:29.298 --> 26:34.992
goes back about 10 years or so.

26:36.524 --> 26:42.433
How this conflict is going to be resolved is 
exceedingly difficult for me to see. But many of

26:42.994 --> 26:47.141
them fall in this area. And I think there are, 
again, some very real problems as to how those who

26:47.161 --> 27:04.388
would consider themselves as environmentally 
concerned private citizens and so on, as to how

26:47.161 --> 27:04.388
they can get information and so on and i've had a 
number of sort of sad experiences of you know being

27:05.144 --> 27:33.801
asked can they get certain types of information 
and so on and i'd say oh yes and they then they say

27:05.144 --> 27:33.801
well who paid for this and i have to say well the navy 
or the atomic energy commission or the seattle

27:05.144 --> 27:33.801
power and light and they say oh well that's not what 
we want you know and yet they don't have the money to

27:34.608 --> 27:39.993
support their own kind of programs. And I've also 
been told that many of them have a great deal of

27:40.113 --> 27:52.485
difficulty of getting the kind of information 
that they think exists from state and federal

27:40.113 --> 27:52.485
agencies.

27:54.186 --> 28:03.315
I'm sure they get fighted on the sort of Freedom of 
Information Act, but in many cases, they probably

27:54.186 --> 28:03.315
don't even know what it is they were to ask for. So I 
think there is a very real sort of problem here of

28:03.650 --> 28:19.295
lack of support for the kind of environmentalist 
point of view. And it's not always entirely

28:20.336 --> 28:30.973
rational, because if the scientific work is done 
adequately, it should stand up scrutiny. I've had

28:31.527 --> 28:41.114
people, you know, just turn off completely 
because I have to say, well, yes, that was

28:31.527 --> 28:41.114
supported by some federal agency or something or 
other. I mean, oh, that's tainted.
