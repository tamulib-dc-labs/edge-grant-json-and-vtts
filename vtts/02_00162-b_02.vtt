WEBVTT

00:08.958 --> 00:12.042
that you were talking about, spirits and 
feelings. Well, yeah, I'm just saying that, you

00:12.222 --> 00:22.356
know,

00:12.222 --> 00:22.356
life is a summation of all the experiences and what 
they meant to you, I think. And I have been as

00:23.218 --> 00:36.636
fortunate a person as ever has been born in that 
I've got relationships in my college days that,

00:23.218 --> 00:36.636
frankly, most of them have been because of A&M 
since I graduated. And I'm talking about local A&M

00:37.072 --> 00:39.054
clubs. Again, I mentioned before, any church, you 
meet A&M people, you met people. I know people

00:43.559 --> 00:46.262
because I saw a ring across the room somewhere. 
I've been here at Granbury. I moved down here

00:47.664 --> 00:48.485
recently. I see those rings and walk over, and it's 
an entree. You walk over there, and you're not

00:51.828 --> 00:54.251
meeting a stranger. You don't feel like you are, 
and you feel very comfortable in that. It's given

00:57.995 --> 01:06.184
me, in my personal life, an opportunity to 
accomplish a lot outside the economic realm. And

01:06.738 --> 01:16.449
that means serving A&M in the best way that I know 
how and up, frankly, maybe exceeding my level of

01:06.738 --> 01:16.449
capability, associating with former students, 
to give you an example. How in the world would you

01:16.469 --> 01:21.835
feel ever up to serving as the president of the 
Association of Former Students? You represent

01:21.915 --> 01:28.382
200,000 people who feel about it like I do, or at 
least most of us do. It's been an experience for our

01:28.742 --> 01:33.167
family towards a social environment. It would not 
be anything else. I'm not sending out many things

01:35.934 --> 01:42.060
that are rewarding in your life, because we all 
participate in those, because we all do. But Bo and

01:42.080 --> 01:47.685
I, it's a major outlet in our personal lives. 
Without it, we would be a far less rich life. It's

01:51.429 --> 02:01.078
given us an opportunity to expose our son to Texas 
A&M in the time he was a squirt, all the way to where

01:51.429 --> 02:01.078
he graduated with it. with the experience that 
I've had. And he's very dedicated to that. He feels

02:03.923 --> 02:06.527
very similar to it than I do. And he will have a 
richer life than I do. So it's meant, next to our

02:09.491 --> 02:21.970
faith and our family, Texas A&M is right in there 
with what's important to us. And it's because of

02:21.990 --> 02:26.617
what has contributed to the life, to our life. And I 
don't think that there's any way to repay that

02:26.637 --> 02:30.002
adequately. Is there anything that I haven't 
touched on that you want to... Well, first off, I

02:31.923 --> 02:40.375
appreciate you doing this. Don't worry about it. I 
think that you made a point. You know, history's a

02:43.319 --> 02:46.864
great teacher, but you've got to record it first. 
It doesn't serve the purpose of this, but not...

02:46.884 --> 03:00.664
And my contribution, of course, is minimal, but 
there's some people who are renowned who you'll be

02:46.884 --> 03:00.664
interviewing who have experiences that are as 
rich for them as mine has been for me, but their

03:02.973 --> 03:09.561
profile is high. You see, and what I worry about 
too, nobody keeps a diary anymore. We don't write

03:12.785 --> 03:14.947
personal letters much anymore. We don't write 
personal letters. And when those people are no

03:16.029 --> 03:20.855
more, their memory will be gone. Like Aquarius, we 
missed all that. Somebody needs to talk to Herbie.

03:29.129 --> 03:31.392
But Mrs. Rudder, John Colviss, all kinds of folks 
like that. That's so important. Because like you

03:36.658 --> 03:44.527
say, there's not a good record of those things like 
in the past, but people don't write things, they

03:36.658 --> 03:44.527
email or they call the department, they phone. I 
would encourage somebody down on Booth to read

03:44.887 --> 03:51.655
that when this project is completed, that every 
year the past president is interviewed. Oh, at

03:51.675 --> 03:52.857
length. Because that is just adding another 
chapter to the book, and this is not a closed book.

03:58.475 --> 04:01.735
But hopefully it goes on for hundreds of years.
