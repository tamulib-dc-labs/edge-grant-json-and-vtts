WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:03.098
You can be general. I'm going to give a name because 
I'm proud of this young man. We had a player named

00:06.483 --> 00:08.907
Lester Hayes. Oh, of course. And you probably 
remember Lester Hayes. Yes, I do. One of the things

00:11.951 --> 00:21.685
that was unique about him was he was a defensive 
back, and he discovered that the more stick them he

00:11.951 --> 00:21.685
put on his hands, the more balls he intercepted. 
And by the time he got into the pros, he would

00:22.507 --> 00:30.358
actually have grease all over his hands, and they 
finally patched the Lester Hayes rule that

00:22.507 --> 00:30.358
prevented that. But Lester had a speech 
impediment. You remember that, I'm sure. And a

00:34.651 --> 00:41.383
basketball player named Randy Knowles, who was a 
real good shooter, was in my class. And I'm

00:42.204 --> 00:45.030
blocking the tackle right now. There was a 
defensive tackle in that class, a big guy. He was

00:51.301 --> 00:52.363
also black. Of course, Randy Knowles was a white 
guy, and Lester was black, and so was this fella.

00:57.587 --> 01:00.732
And they were a lot of fun. They kept the class 
moving, but I could tell they often were not

01:00.793 --> 01:06.001
prepared for class. And I worried about Lester, 
whether or not he was going to be able to survive in

01:07.543 --> 01:18.621
this environment or not, until after class one 
day, he and this defensive tackle were having a

01:18.736 --> 01:19.817
discussion. And it was an informal discussion 
about defensive football. And Lester outlined

01:24.642 --> 01:32.850
one of the most succinct explanations of 
defensive system I'd ever seen. And he stumbled

01:33.331 --> 01:37.375
and stuttered and did it, but it was really 
intricate. And I thought, this guy is not a dumb

01:38.376 --> 01:41.219
guy. He might have some disadvantages, but he's 
not dumb. Later on, as he was drafted in the pros, he

01:47.710 --> 01:55.340
was, after one of his really good games, they 
interviewed him on TV. I saw the interview, in

01:55.461 --> 01:56.642
fact. And, of course, he was excited. He had won the 
game, and he was nervous, and he could not make a

01:58.965 --> 02:02.270
sentence. He didn't get three words together. He 
saw that in a rerun and was so embarrassed by it

02:04.713 --> 02:15.368
until he went to school then and got some help and 
learned to combat that speech impediment. And the

02:15.388 --> 02:17.110
last time I heard him, he was Very controlled kind 
of conversation. I don't know when I've ever been

02:21.181 --> 02:23.305
more proud of a young man. All right, now, I'm 
trying, my brain is trying to recall, there was

02:23.345 --> 02:36.129
somebody else, some other athlete's wife, who was 
trained in speech therapy. I think maybe you're

02:36.670 --> 02:37.692
right. Who helped him some. Yeah. I think maybe 
you're right about that. I didn't know where he

02:42.427 --> 02:44.490
went for his help. Because there was a at one point 
there was a worry as to whether Lester could pass

02:45.171 --> 02:56.183
everything here and his lack of confidence and so 
forth. Did anybody ever twist your arm about a

02:56.223 --> 03:02.289
grade for an athlete?

03:04.312 --> 03:04.832
Never did. I don't think I ever recall any. But I 
made I made it clear very early on. I had been a

03:11.388 --> 03:15.072
coach, and I knew what coaches did. And I made it 
very clear that I was going to do two things, that

03:15.092 --> 03:22.300
they were going to be treated fairly in my class. 
When I was in college, I can remember going to a

03:22.861 --> 03:27.166
chemistry class one morning. And this happened 
pretty often. And the instructor said, how many

03:29.589 --> 03:32.592
basketball players are here? And you raise your 
hand, and he'd say, you might as well drop this

03:33.736 --> 03:36.781
class. You cannot make it in here. You're going to 
miss some classes, and you can't make it. And it got

03:40.588 --> 03:43.793
to the point where you were afraid to answer that 
question. Because other classes, they'd say, how

03:43.814 --> 03:46.097
many basketball players are here? And you raise 
your hand, I like basketball. I'm glad you're

03:47.861 --> 03:48.562
here. And you got to where you were gun shy about 
whether to raise your hand or not raise your hand.

03:52.769 --> 03:57.938
And so one of the first things I'd tell my athletes 
was, you're going to be treated fairly in this

03:52.769 --> 03:57.938
class. And I know you represent the university. 
You're going to miss some classes. And you'll be

04:02.479 --> 04:06.803
allowed to make up everything that can be made up. 
But I'm not going to keep you eligible. You're

04:10.306 --> 04:11.787
going to have to do that on your own. And I did that 
early on. And so I never had a lot of problems. But

04:16.432 --> 04:22.297
the one time I think I was going to be approached was 
when Coach Sherrill was here. I was department

04:23.338 --> 04:24.379
head then. And he called me over to Kane Hall for 
lunch. And I'm not sure yet what the purpose of that

04:28.462 --> 04:33.390
meeting was. It might have been just to get to know 
them. Because we have always had a good

04:35.333 --> 04:42.806
relationship with athletics, unlike a lot of 
schools where health and physical education

04:35.333 --> 04:42.806
athletics were at war with one another. We never 
had that kind of relationship here. But Coach

04:45.791 --> 04:48.495
Cheryl had me over to lunch at Kane Hall. and we 
visited and talked and a lot of people came by the

04:48.695 --> 05:13.639
table and when we got through I could tell he was 
about to say something and before he opened his

04:48.695 --> 05:13.639
mouth I said coach I want to tell you how much we how 
pleased we are that you're here and I want to tell

04:48.695 --> 05:13.639
you that we've always had a real good relationship 
with between our two departments and and I sure

04:48.695 --> 05:13.639
hope we can can maintain that but but there's 
there's a couple things you need to know number one

05:14.007 --> 05:17.172
And I went through the same spiel about how we 
treated athletes in our department. And I said,

05:17.192 --> 05:19.676
you can count on that. If they have to miss, we'll 
help them make it up. We're not going to keep them

05:22.801 --> 05:24.603
eligible. And the second thing is, I won't be a 
dumping ground for your worn-out coaches. If you

05:27.648 --> 05:29.651
don't want them, I don't want them. And he kind of 
cleared his throat and said, there's no shortcuts

05:29.671 --> 05:32.616
in this business. And that's the only comment that 
he made. And consequently, we got along very well.

05:38.290 --> 05:41.015
But I have to say, I never was approached. Were you 
ever approached as a faculty member? No, no, I

05:43.278 --> 05:44.180
never was. I never was. Occasionally, and I knew a 
good many coaches personally, occasionally a

05:46.063 --> 05:55.478
coach would see me in the hallway and say, hey, 
how's so-and-so doing? But I never had any arm

05:56.320 --> 05:59.505
twisted or anything. I never did. When Ballard was 
here, I was one of the people that he called on when

06:01.139 --> 06:07.106
it was still legal to do so. When he'd have athletes 
here for the weekend, I'd go over on Saturdays and

06:08.247 --> 06:15.736
talk to them about the institution actually and so 
forth. I remember talking to Bubba Bean. Describe

06:21.083 --> 06:27.130
the relationship between the Department of 
Athletics and the Department of, and did the name

06:28.072 --> 06:38.821
change of your department in the 70s or early 80s? 
Yeah, it changed in the 80s, somewhere around 83,

06:39.042 --> 06:43.093
84. And what was the name change? It was changed 
from health and physical education to health and

06:44.235 --> 06:47.800
kinesiology. And it actually really reflects 
what's going on in what was then physical

06:47.820 --> 06:54.169
education better. We made the change ourselves, 
but it was not without motivation. We had wanted to

07:00.318 --> 07:03.082
change it for some time. In fact, the field, the 
discipline felt the need to change. But there

07:10.233 --> 07:10.954
wasn't We couldn't get an agreement as to what we 
wanted to be. We couldn't even get an agreement

07:14.248 --> 07:16.691
within our own department. But what happened was 
that there was a guy from Delmont, and I'm

07:17.532 --> 07:21.497
forgetting his name. I thought I never would 
forget it. He was chairman of education for the

07:22.719 --> 07:28.146
legislature, chairman of the education 
committee. And he got the legislature to pass a

07:28.987 --> 07:31.550
law. And you may have been at UTEP at that time. I 
can't remember exactly. But the law was that you

07:34.474 --> 07:39.720
could have no more than six hours of education in 
your curriculum. And that put And the way they

07:41.528 --> 07:49.005
interpreted that law was that any word, anytime 
you had the word education, that meant that was an

07:41.528 --> 07:49.005
education course. So music education was an 
education course. Health education was an

07:52.513 --> 07:54.457
education course. Physical education was an 
education course. So we were forced to change. And

07:59.045 --> 08:02.551
of course we made the case that not all of our 
courses were education. Some of them were

08:02.911 --> 08:06.777
discipline specific, others were methodology, 
and those were education. So it was easy to get

08:07.338 --> 08:12.306
consensus because we knew that our future 
depended on it. But in making that change, it

08:12.326 --> 08:19.478
better reflects what's going on in physical 
education. The old physical education programs

08:20.099 --> 08:26.048
is only a very small part of what is done over there 
now. Exercise physiology, motor learning,

08:26.247 --> 08:31.556
biomechanics, those are the big things now. And I 
regret that some. But the relationship of our

08:36.624 --> 08:42.694
department to athletics has always been a very 
good one. Carl Landis, I think he did, he started

08:43.175 --> 08:46.500
that. I don't know if he started it or not, but he 
certainly kept it going. Of course, Walter

08:50.615 --> 09:00.789
Penberthy came here as intramural director, and 
he was hired by the Department of Athletics to run

08:50.615 --> 09:00.789
the intramural program and later to become 
department head. So there was always that

09:01.931 --> 09:03.694
relationship. And if you go back far enough, most 
of the coaches were faculty members in physical

09:03.874 --> 09:08.781
education. So when Carl came along, he did nothing 
to hurt that. In fact, enhanced it. And I hope I did

09:14.809 --> 09:17.012
the same thing. There were a lot of good that came 
out of that. Number one, we weren't throwing rocks

09:20.534 --> 09:26.542
at each other and constantly doing damage to 
people that didn't deserve it. Secondly, we got

09:28.004 --> 09:30.728
some nice things out of it. For example, they 
wanted, Emory Ballard wanted to expand the

09:31.008 --> 09:38.539
football stadium. But if you build that football 
stadium, you have to have something to hold it up.

09:43.180 --> 09:51.831
And he didn't quite have enough money to, you know 
this story better than I do, he didn't have enough

09:43.180 --> 09:51.831
money to build the stadium, so they wanted to tap 
the permanent university fund. But you couldn't

09:52.612 --> 09:55.816
use a permanent university fund for athletics. 
So, hence, we got a brand new building, a health and

09:56.437 --> 10:04.146
physical education, a much needed building, I 
might add, and doubled our square footage.

10:04.327 --> 10:05.929
Describe those facilities. Oh, at the time, they 
were state of the art. We've kind of been passed

10:08.632 --> 10:11.736
now, but... There was new administrative offices 
on the first floor, which were superb, complete

10:12.205 --> 10:25.761
with conference rooms and faculty offices, 
classrooms, which have been recently upgraded,

10:12.205 --> 10:25.761
by the way, in their state of the art. Now the 
classrooms are. On the second floor were our labs,

10:27.843 --> 10:33.289
human performance labs, dance studios, and those 
kinds of things. Fourth floor was gymnasiums, and

10:34.030 --> 10:37.694
the last floor was gymnasium. We went from a from a 
situation where everybody was doubled up and

10:39.965 --> 10:46.011
sometimes tripled up in offices so that we all had 
private offices. And we never would have gotten

10:46.331 --> 10:48.253
that. Well, it would have been very difficult to 
have gotten that, apart from athletics. They were

10:51.996 --> 10:54.939
the point people on that. Then Jackie Sherrill 
came along and wanted a state-of-the-art weight

10:56.180 --> 11:02.305
room, a conditioning room. And so he built the 
STEED. What does he call that? Strength and

11:05.989 --> 11:07.390
Conditioning Laboratory. which is really an 
exercise room. But once again, he didn't have

11:11.074 --> 11:14.017
quite enough money to build the whole building. So 
he agreed that a third of the building could belong

11:14.117 --> 11:18.842
to our department. And in return, they got to use 
some permanent university money for that. And we

11:23.688 --> 11:33.158
built the human performance laboratory over 
there, which is, I'm probably sitting in this

11:23.688 --> 11:33.158
chair because that lab is over there. Because one 
of the things they do over there is stress testing

11:33.627 --> 11:44.102
with physician supervision and monitoring the 
heart at the same time. And that's how they found my

11:44.122 --> 11:46.505
heart condition. I didn't know I was even a 
problem. And consequently, they caught it,

11:48.808 --> 11:52.373
corrected it, or at least treated it. And I was a 
walking time bomb. I was 90% occluded and didn't

11:54.837 --> 11:57.120
know it. So some nice things have occurred as a 
result of that relationship. Now we've taken some

12:03.817 --> 12:06.700
hits because of it, too. Being that closely 
related, there are a lot in the academic community

12:07.842 --> 12:13.809
who will equate us with them. And it's been a 
constant battle to remind everyone that we're an

12:14.190 --> 12:20.298
academic program. And sometimes it's hurt us. On 
the whole, I wouldn't, you know, the good has been

12:23.510 --> 12:28.919
better than the bad, I think. I'm not going to ask 
the negative. Of all the coaches and athletic

12:30.301 --> 12:36.952
department personnel you all have worked with, to 
which ones would you give the highest grades? Who

12:37.332 --> 12:40.678
was the most positive and helpful? Oh, Wally Groff 
is outstanding. He really is good. I understand

12:44.223 --> 12:49.652
that former students are burning him a little bit 
now, and primarily it's because of him. the one

12:50.105 --> 12:52.287
loss records, overall one loss records. But 
anyone who knows Wiley knows he's first class. We

12:58.313 --> 13:01.155
didn't really have a bad situation. Of course, I 
didn't go back as far as Barry Bryant, so I don't

13:01.336 --> 13:04.839
know that story. But

13:05.600 --> 13:12.066
I don't recall a bad situation, even when Coach 
Sherrill was here. And, of course, he pushed the

13:12.126 --> 13:16.450
edge of the envelope a lot of the time. I still had no 
relationship problem with him. But Wally is by far

13:20.472 --> 13:22.937
the best we've had.

13:27.206 --> 13:37.527
In the late 70s and 80s, what were some of the 
stepping stones that caused you and your

13:27.206 --> 13:37.527
colleagues to know that things were moving 
forward? Well, I took the liberty of writing down

13:37.912 --> 13:44.099
some things, mainly because you warned me that you 
might ask me that question. I

13:44.119 --> 13:55.792
think in the time I was here, the College of 
Education had just been created about two years

13:44.119 --> 13:55.792
before my arrival. It had come out of science, and 
they lumped ADCI and Ag Ed and us and some others

13:56.292 --> 14:01.538
together. And that was an important move, I think, 
for allowing us to develop the way we should have.

14:06.818 --> 14:21.756
But in 1973, we got our undergraduate curriculum 
in health education approved, which allowed us to

14:06.818 --> 14:21.756
have those individuals who wanted to go into 
school health could major in health education,

14:06.818 --> 14:21.756
and those who wanted to work in in public health and 
places like that could major in community health.

14:25.562 --> 14:26.323
So it did two things. It opened up the health 
curriculum, but it also, for the first time, made

14:26.383 --> 14:35.937
it possible to, in our department, to get a degree 
without being teacher certified. You could do

14:36.037 --> 14:39.262
something a little different.

14:40.504 --> 14:50.578
In 1974,

14:40.504 --> 14:50.578
we developed a cardiac rehab program. Dr. George 
Jessup was the person who primarily did that along

14:50.812 --> 15:08.961
with Baylor College of Medicine and we began to 
develop majors who could actually work in cardiac

14:50.812 --> 15:08.961
rehab facilities and we helped with the 
development of the Methodist Hospitals program

14:50.812 --> 15:08.961
in cardiac rehab. Prior to that, the allied health 
program that we've talked about before in here

15:11.990 --> 15:15.816
that we have. It was a consortium between us and 
Baylor College of Medicine and the University of

15:16.337 --> 15:21.725
Houston. And to some degree, that relationship 
that was established with Baylor and us helped, I

15:22.687 --> 15:30.419
think, with the relationship that later was 
established for the med school. But I wouldn't I

15:33.083 --> 15:39.474
can't take much credit for that, but the 
discussion that went on at the upper

15:33.083 --> 15:39.474
administration level opened that door, I think. 
Then Carl Landis had already established a lot of

15:41.839 --> 15:55.463
our laboratories, but in moving to our new 
building, we were able to build the mechanical

15:41.839 --> 15:55.463
analysis lab, the human performance lab, the 
motor performance lab. And for the first time we

15:55.814 --> 16:07.035
were doing research that was legitimate research 
that could hold us on with any in the, not any in the

15:55.814 --> 16:07.035
university, but most in the university.

16:10.301 --> 16:15.932
Then in the fall of 74, it was kind of a benchmark 
happening for the activity program. There was an

16:16.300 --> 16:17.942
attack on the program. There were some on campus 
that wanted to do away with that program, and there

16:18.263 --> 16:23.971
always was some. But as a result of that attack, the 
program actually got strengthened. For the first

16:28.638 --> 16:35.348
time, at least since I've been here, they began to 
give college credit for those courses. Prior to

16:35.408 --> 16:38.933
that time, you'll recall, it was possible to have 
better than a four-point average because you got

16:39.402 --> 16:43.308
those added on. This changed the way they operated 
there. And I think it gave us a little more respect

16:45.912 --> 16:48.837
for the program.

16:51.481 --> 16:59.594
Then a major thing happened was

16:51.481 --> 16:59.594
with the Project 2000. Is that what they called 
that then? The Board of Regents Initiative,

17:01.277 --> 17:06.625
Project 2000, changed our perspective made us 
look at graduate programs a lot more than we had

17:07.516 --> 17:12.561
before. And that affected everybody in the 
university and certainly affected us.

17:20.650 --> 17:25.355
In 1973, they also added an expansion to G. Raleigh 
White. And for the first time, there was women's

17:26.476 --> 17:29.059
locker rooms. There had never been women's locker 
rooms prior to that. They were dressed in a little

17:31.081 --> 17:32.522
closet area. And women's bathrooms. And there 
were some other facilities added. And that

17:37.635 --> 17:40.380
changed the complexion of the university. And 
about that time was when we began to see a lot more

17:40.440 --> 17:45.709
women show up on campus. And I can remember walking 
down the hall in G. Raleigh one morning going to

17:47.091 --> 17:52.280
class, and two guys were in front of me. And one of 
them said to the other one that said, you know, when

17:53.101 --> 18:00.253
I came here, I didn't see one pretty girl in a month. 
Now I see one everywhere I look. And the first time I

18:03.687 --> 18:09.493
thought of it, the scenery was changing 
considerably on campus.

18:12.256 --> 18:15.900
Then in 1980, we opened what was then called East 
Cal. It later became known as the Reed Building,

18:15.960 --> 18:20.845
which is the building we're in now. And that was a 
biggie. That really made a difference. Carl

18:23.909 --> 18:25.110
Landis did most of the of the work on that building. 
I got the credit for it because it opened under my

18:26.865 --> 18:33.037
administration, but he really did the work there.

18:35.863 --> 18:46.002
In 1980,

18:35.863 --> 18:46.002
we were introduced to a guy named Tom Reed, and that 
was a really big thing for the department, I think.

18:46.403 --> 18:49.048
Is it okay to talk a little bit about that? Oh, 
please do. And tell us about his background. That

18:52.275 --> 18:55.561
story is, I think, kind of an unusual one. Tom Reed 
grew up in Lakeland or Lakeview, and I'm sorry I

18:57.785 --> 19:03.477
don't know the Ohio. It's an outskirt of 
Cleveland. He

19:06.333 --> 19:14.927
grew up during the 40s and so he was drafted into or 
joined the Army Air Force. And he flew transport

19:15.688 --> 19:18.132
airplanes. He flew the Burma Hump. That was one of 
his major assignments. And upon getting out of the

19:23.661 --> 19:26.265
service, He took the GI Bill and went to college. He 
went to a school called Kinney College, Kinney

19:30.077 --> 19:36.623
College in Ohio. Small liberal arts school. Paul 
Newman was in that school. And Jonathan, Jonathan

19:41.167 --> 19:45.812
who, the comedian, Jonathan. Waters? No. No, no, 
no. Winters, Winters. Winters. Jonathan

19:49.855 --> 19:50.636
Winters, yeah. They were both in his class. And it 
wasn't about 500 students in the whole school, I

19:52.958 --> 19:55.240
think. Well, while he was in school there, he 
opened the first bookstore they'd ever had in that

19:56.300 --> 20:05.334
school, you know, where they sold peanuts and 
popcorns and paper and that kind of thing. He said

20:06.135 --> 20:09.641
he made so much money until he decided he needed 
college, so he dropped out of school. Dropped out

20:09.661 --> 20:15.490
and almost immediately the store went belly up. 
But he never did finish school. He kind of diddled

20:17.716 --> 20:19.038
back and forth. And so while looking for a job, a 
friend of his was working for a guy named Fred

20:19.098 --> 20:34.964
Lennon, who manufactured pipe fittings and 
talked Tom into working for him. Now, that itself

20:35.906 --> 20:38.129
is kind of a unique story. All this fished together 
down the road a piece. Fred Lennon was... was a

20:42.385 --> 20:44.047
marketing person. That was his specialty. And 
there was another man named Crawford who was an

20:46.571 --> 20:49.555
engineer. Crawford manufactured or invented 
this pipe fitting, a unique way of fitting pipes

20:50.436 --> 20:54.983
together. It's called Swaglock is the brand name 
now. And he wanted to market it, but he didn't know

20:58.828 --> 21:05.878
how, so he partnered with Fred Lennon, and they 
marketed it and did pretty well. Well, Lennon,

21:06.348 --> 21:14.142
being a businessman, wanted to go into Cleveland, 
build a foundry, and actually do this big time,

21:06.348 --> 21:14.142
which would incur a lot of debt. And Crawford, 
being an academician, didn't want to do that, so he

21:14.943 --> 21:22.577
sold out to Lennon for something under $20,000, 
according to Tom Reed. Well, Lennon went into

21:23.558 --> 21:29.048
Cleveland, built his foundry, and the short of it 
is he's now the largest manufacturer of pipe

21:29.315 --> 21:34.541
fittings in the entire world, worth billions of 
dollars. Tom went to work for him and they sent him

21:36.143 --> 21:40.368
to Houston. He said he was just a peddler. He said, I 
had my inventory in the trunk of the car and kept my

21:42.331 --> 21:47.297
books in the front seat. My territory was Texas, 
Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana. He

21:51.963 --> 21:53.905
had a huge territory. which he quickly narrowed 
down. And he became very successful. A couple of

22:01.012 --> 22:02.654
things happened to him. One, he developed a unique 
way of marketing in that he identified vice

22:03.254 --> 22:08.660
presidents. He called them vice presidents. And 
he set each of those people up in a warehouse. And he

22:13.725 --> 22:18.510
liked athletes an awful lot because he liked the 
competitiveness of their nature. And he had five

22:19.311 --> 22:21.072
of those guys eventually. Each one of them had 
their own store. And he took a piece of the action

22:24.310 --> 22:26.452
out of each store. But the understanding was that 
when he retired, he would give them their store. He

22:32.097 --> 22:34.419
would set them up in business, in effect. They just 
had to wait for deferred gratification. And that

22:37.181 --> 22:39.123
was successful. But being in the pipe business, he 
also was close to the oil business. And so he got in

22:43.587 --> 22:50.873
on the bottom floor of the Midland Odessa oil field 
and invested in a few of those wells and never had a

22:43.587 --> 22:50.873
dry hole. He had five or six wells that came in. And 
consequently, he became very wealthy. Now here's

22:57.594 --> 22:59.798
where the story begins to tie together. He said 
that when he was a youngster, he played baseball.

23:05.648 --> 23:10.236
And in the summertime, he'd look around and all of 
his friends would be gone. And he discovered that

23:11.078 --> 23:13.622
they were off in summer camp. His parents, though, 
weren't poor, but they didn't feel like it was in

23:14.075 --> 23:19.622
the middle of the Depression or end of the 
Depression. He didn't feel like that they could

23:19.662 --> 23:22.846
send him to camp. So he made himself a promise that 
when he got rich, he was going to build a camp for

23:23.627 --> 23:33.520
kids who couldn't go to camp, like we all play those 
kind of games. Well, when he became very

23:34.421 --> 23:43.693
successful, he remembered that promise, and he 
wanted to do something good, and so he decided to

23:34.421 --> 23:43.693
build a camp. And he went out to San Diego out in the 
desert area, bought some property, was going to

23:44.382 --> 23:52.291
build his camp out there. For some reason he 
discovered that he didn't, that was not a good

23:53.973 --> 23:57.497
deal. One thing is he liked to be a hands-on type 
person and Houston was a long way from San Diego. So

24:03.083 --> 24:11.773
he decided not to build a camp, but he held the 
property for a while and sold it and made an obscene

24:03.083 --> 24:11.773
profit off of it because San Diego was moving out in 
that direction. So then he bought some property in

24:12.277 --> 24:18.025
Kerrville and decided that he would build a camp 
there. And he actually started construction. But

24:21.330 --> 24:31.725
he went over there one day, and his builder, who was 
a sheriff of the county, had more of his building

24:21.330 --> 24:31.725
materials on the sheriff's home than he did out in 
the property. So he got discouraged and said,

24:31.746 --> 24:36.192
well, maybe the good Lord just doesn't want me to 
build this camp. But he held on the land a while and

24:36.847 --> 24:39.391
sold it. And he said again, the profit was so great. 
He said it was tremendous what he made off that

24:41.313 --> 24:42.896
profit. And he said, well, maybe the Lord does want 
me to do this. So finally he found this place down in

24:45.620 --> 24:47.563
Magnolia. And it was about 35 acres. It had a small 
cabin on it. And that's where he began to clear off

24:51.969 --> 24:57.176
the land and build some cabins. And the first I knew 
anything about it, Bob Rutledge, do you recall

24:57.237 --> 25:06.550
him, called me one day and said, I was department 
head, and said, Len, how would you like to have

25:07.171 --> 25:10.156
$100,000 in scholarships? I said, well, I'd like 
to have $100,000 in scholarships. I said, well, I

25:13.422 --> 25:15.946
got a guy down in Houston that's going to give you 
some. I said, but he wants to talk to you. He's going

25:18.531 --> 25:21.897
to give you the money no matter what, but I want you 
to go down and listen to him. And so I discovered

25:22.899 --> 25:26.966
that what he was looking for was someone to run the 
camp for him. He'd had some bad experiences. He

25:29.069 --> 25:30.512
first tried to get a an employee to run it, and that 
just didn't work out very well for him. So I went

25:34.659 --> 25:38.684
down there expecting to see some pup tents by a 
creek. And what I saw was about a million dollar

25:39.404 --> 25:42.328
plant. It was really, really well underway then. 
And it didn't take long to figure out that'd be a

25:46.092 --> 25:49.476
good thing for us to get involved in. And so we took 
one of our lecturers who taught in the activity

25:49.536 --> 25:59.487
program who didn't have summer employment and 
made him the director. We took some of our majors

25:59.855 --> 26:03.880
and made them the counselors. And we went down to 
run the camp. And it happened that this fellow, his

26:06.563 --> 26:11.629
name was Bob Pankey, was the lecturer that I'd 
chosen. P-A-N-K-E-Y. And he had worked in I

26:14.232 --> 26:21.800
think a Bob White. What's Bob White's dad's name 
that worked here? You're talking about Camp...

26:24.408 --> 26:28.873
Camp Kanekut. Kanekut, up in Missouri. Right, and 
I can't think of his dad's name now, but you know who

26:30.435 --> 26:34.660
I'm talking about. I want to say Jojo, and that's 
not quite right. Yeah, Jojo's his son, and Joe and

26:36.702 --> 26:43.370
Bob, and his dad's name is... We'll think of it 
later. Of course, the Penberths were close to

26:43.410 --> 26:46.473
them. Well, Bob Pankey had worked at Camp Kanekut 
and knew a little bit about that, and so he

26:46.494 --> 26:52.120
developed his program, and And I would go down two 
or three times and look at it. And at the end of the

26:55.030 --> 27:01.224
summer, Tom called me in and said, this is the best 
I've ever had this camp run. I want to keep this

27:01.344 --> 27:02.927
going. And here's another check for $100,000. And 
so we were encouraged by that. and found out that

27:13.109 --> 27:19.656
the counselors were really getting good 
experiences because they were working with

27:13.109 --> 27:19.656
youngsters that they were going to be working 
with. So we went back the next year and ran the camp

27:21.018 --> 27:23.340
again. At the end of that year, he gave us a check for 
$250,000. And so he's been very generous with us

27:25.322 --> 27:30.348
along the way. And then not a few years ago, about 
eight or ten years ago, his health started

27:31.269 --> 27:37.075
deteriorating. And being a person that wanted 
hands-on type operation, he wanted someone down

27:37.756 --> 27:42.441
at the camp And he asked me one day if I thought that 
if he gave a chair to the university, would that

27:43.147 --> 27:50.757
lock us into that camp? And of course, we assured 
him that it would. And so he gave us a $500,000

27:53.861 --> 27:59.728
matched chair. And then later, I was named to that 
chair, which was undeservedly so. But

28:05.496 --> 28:07.298
nevertheless, it worked out good. And that's 
about the time I decided to step down as department

28:07.649 --> 28:10.915
head. So in the summer, I worked down there. I'm 
back and forth between there and the university.

28:15.985 --> 28:16.746
And his name? His name is Tom Reed, R-E-A-D.

28:23.528 --> 28:30.056
What's good about that was he continued to give us 
discretionary money in the denominator, about

28:23.528 --> 28:30.056
$25,000 a year. And he's done that for, or did that 
until his death, and his widow has continued now,

28:30.677 --> 28:37.666
and it's been about 10 or 15 years that he's done 
that kind of thing. That's been a big deal for us.

28:39.969 --> 28:44.995
And consequently, we named our building the Reed 
Building because of that. He died about nine years

28:46.056 --> 28:49.941
ago. And his widow has continued to be very 
generous with him. I think that relationship was

28:53.504 --> 29:01.134
an important one because we have been able to do 
some things that we wouldn't have been able to do

28:53.504 --> 29:01.134
without those funds.

29:05.900 --> 29:08.483
Prior to that, the Omar Smith chair had come our 
way. And that also was a big thing. You remember

29:11.006 --> 29:12.949
Omar was a tennis coach here. And Bob Walker helped 
us get that chair. It was given to us as stock in the

29:15.252 --> 29:19.557
Deer Queens. and wasn't funded until about five or 
six years ago. But that was a benchmark for us.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.995
Then we developed an outdoor education 
institute. Mickey Little did that while she was

29:36.055 --> 29:38.177
here. And another benchmark was the emergency 
medical care program that Laura Kitzmiller put

29:38.237 --> 29:45.664
together. Laura was really the main person and the 
only person that ran that program for a good long

29:46.865 --> 29:54.433
time. And that's been a major, major benchmark. 
The other important thing we did along the way was

29:59.142 --> 30:04.878
the recruiting of minorities. Just in a quick and 
dirty way, those are the highlights that I would I

30:08.643 --> 30:09.444
would put together. How did you recruit those 
minorities? Well, we finally decided that they

30:12.248 --> 30:15.231
weren't going to come to us. We just had to go find 
them. And so we called some people that we knew that

30:16.693 --> 30:22.480
had minorities in their undergraduate programs. 
What kind of folks? Well, at Northwestern was our

30:23.902 --> 30:28.648
colleagues over there in health and physical 
education. We knew that they had Northwest

30:29.089 --> 30:32.172
Louisiana. And there was a guy named Frank Ashley 
who They had recently graduated, and he had gone to

30:36.942 --> 30:41.828
Alabama for his doctorate and was finishing. And 
so we were able to look him up and bring him on. And of

30:44.652 --> 30:48.116
course, Frank is now the director of admissions at 
A&M. And he really helped us bring others in when

30:49.899 --> 30:54.545
you just get that first one. We had another kid 
named Butler that came in as a lecturer and then got

30:55.346 --> 31:00.953
his doctorate while he was here. But we still 
aren't very good at it. We have a good mix of men and

31:05.528 --> 31:11.698
women, but a minority is still, it's a hard fight. 
Let's go back. Carl Landis served as department

31:13.982 --> 31:16.426
head until when? Until 1979. And I don't remember 
what year he started. Did you succeed him? I

31:21.775 --> 31:23.699
succeeded him. Describe how that came about. What 
was the process and how were you identified and so

31:25.622 --> 31:31.131
forth? I don't know that I was ready for that job, 
and I'm sure they weren't thinking about me. Linus

31:39.753 --> 31:43.365
Dow was the heir apparent.
