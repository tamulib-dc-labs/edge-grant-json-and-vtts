WEBVTT

00:03.608 --> 00:13.603
both as an official employee of A&M, but then after 
that, a resident of the local community, and one

00:03.608 --> 00:13.603
interested in A&M. What were the factors that 
helped to make Mr. Rutter such a successful

00:14.664 --> 00:19.451
president? I'll have to go back to it. When he came 
here, he called a meeting of all the staff and

00:22.896 --> 00:27.303
faculty in Ginehall. I'll never forget that. He 
got up on the stage, and they introduced him and so

00:28.845 --> 00:31.309
forth. He says now, I... You know and I know I'm not a 
scholar. I don't claim to be. He said, I'm going to

00:37.190 --> 00:38.832
be here. I'm going to do some things that I think can 
help. And one of the main things I remember him

00:41.717 --> 00:50.630
saying was, he said, I don't understand when we 
bring freshmen in here, we get into graduate

00:41.717 --> 00:50.630
schools. He said, this is the time of the change in 
their life. We need to give them the best we have.

00:55.498 --> 00:57.741
And I think it's one of the greatest things he ever 
did. I agree. But now, I don't think the war, his

00:58.422 --> 01:01.527
war, action had much to do with it. Most people 
didn't know about it. He was just a man's man, I

01:05.839 --> 01:07.622
think. He would talk to anybody. You know this. 
He'd just visit with you. I wrote him a note. We had

01:12.509 --> 01:20.661
one time Texas University threatened to come over 
here and break up our final review. And I was at that

01:22.103 --> 01:26.089
time with Stallings, worked coaching with Coach 
Stallings. This was 1969, 70. And I went down to he

01:29.840 --> 01:54.767
just he

01:29.840 --> 01:54.767
just a

01:29.840 --> 01:54.767
fine guy that he did not feel like he was superior to 
anybody but he knew he could do anything right now

01:29.840 --> 01:54.767
you left the university officially and then came 
back Yeah. In 1970, Stallings, who was coaching

01:55.373 --> 02:02.046
me, asked me to come back on his staff as the 
recruiting partner. Okay. And I came back and

02:02.567 --> 02:05.593
stayed with him until he got fired. All right. 
Let's talk about those years. Okay. How had the NM

02:11.184 --> 02:16.975
changed in 1970 from what you remembered it? Well, 
again, like I said, I stayed on the campus half the

02:18.305 --> 02:23.991
time, and it was just like I'd never left. That's 
what's so strange. I never left the campus even

02:25.313 --> 02:28.457
though I wasn't on the payroll. I was over there 
playing handball or talking or stuff all the time.

02:32.221 --> 02:33.763
But now we had women by then. We had the women, and I 
was definitely against women. My daughter, who's

02:36.446 --> 02:43.013
50 years old now, she could not go to Texas A&M 
because of girls. And I think it's true, and you

02:43.617 --> 02:52.245
know that when they took it to the Supreme Court 
three times, we had women, and I didn't like that.

02:52.406 --> 02:58.251
My wife, my present wife, both her daughters were 
graduates of Texas A&M, and her son-in-law was a

02:52.406 --> 02:58.251
graduate of Texas A&M. I think it's probably the 
greatest thing that ever happened to us. But it was

03:02.115 --> 03:05.879
the idea of having girls on this campus we just 
couldn't buy. And I say publicly, and I'll stand on

03:06.659 --> 03:13.506
the front porch of the MSC, that I think the girls 
have a whole lot better attitude than the boys. You

03:14.009 --> 03:16.372
walk across that campus and see his feet. Yes. And 
you watch some of these jokers, men that are going

03:16.712 --> 03:19.676
to take the A&M. I'm embarrassed. Like you said a 
while ago, you thought he got too big. I agree with

03:23.481 --> 03:24.803
you. When I interviewed Speaker Clayton about his 
student days, he told me that he had been a strong

03:24.823 --> 03:31.431
opponent of coeducation. And I said, well, sir, 
why? And he said, because I thought the girls would

03:34.094 --> 03:39.601
kill the spirit. And then he stopped and he said, do 
the girls have Aggie spirits? And I then, about

03:43.540 --> 03:49.947
what you just said, I said, sir, I believe that they 
have even more pride than the boys do. And he

03:50.668 --> 03:52.990
brightened up and he said, good, good. Then he 
started telling me how many of his nieces and

03:53.451 --> 03:59.938
granddaughters and so forth. I wish she could. I 
wish Pauline could have gone to Texas. Thank you,

04:02.741 --> 04:05.945
thank you. Now, of course, that's the big change 
there, I guess. The big change to me is the size of

04:09.545 --> 04:12.290
it. And we've got, what, 40,000, 42,000. We've got 
2,000 courts. But you talk to people away from

04:16.216 --> 04:21.906
here, in your place in Missouri or North Carolina, 
they still think so. Because that's what they see

04:21.926 --> 04:23.469
on television. That's what they see on the TV ads. 
Let's see. Back to those Stallings days. Describe

04:30.861 --> 04:34.407
Gene Stallings as the football coach then. Okay. 
Frankly, I do not remember James Stallings

04:36.359 --> 04:41.085
playing football with Brad Bryant. He was all 
conference and all. But he wasn't, at least of

04:42.787 --> 04:45.850
course John David stole everything. But I went, 
when Stallings first came back, I refereed

04:46.731 --> 04:53.179
football at Southwest Conference for 25 years. 
And lots of times, we local officials would go down

04:53.559 --> 05:01.849
and work the scrimmage games for the Aggies when 
Bryant was here and all those guys. And I got to know

05:01.869 --> 05:04.172
Stallings out there officiating the scrimmages. 
And one day, we had a play, and I called the pass

05:07.665 --> 05:17.737
interference, and he came charging me, just 
maddering away at him, because I called him. And I

05:17.757 --> 05:23.284
said, look, coach, you want me to call Mike Dower, 
or do you want me to call him? He said, you're proud

05:23.304 --> 05:25.967
of your job, but I'm proud of mine, too. And I've got 
pride in my job, and I'm going to call this game. If

05:28.250 --> 05:30.493
you don't want me, I'll leave right now. Well, I 
thought, I know that guy, too. after that practice

05:32.468 --> 06:01.733
I was walking off he came over and put his arm in my 
shoulder it wasn't two weeks later that he sent one

05:32.468 --> 06:01.733
of his assistant coaches to see if I could work with 
him so when he came to jump on you this is when you

05:32.468 --> 06:01.733
were coaching I mean when he was the head coach I was 
officiating and I wasn't scared of him at all

05:32.468 --> 06:01.733
because I'd seen about ten other coaches come 
through and I learned to love that man as much as I

05:32.468 --> 06:01.733
ever loved a man so I went to work for him and He was a 
funny old boy. I'll tell you off of his thinking

06:04.015 --> 06:08.982
stories, but I won't tell you because I don't want 
to break it. All right, let's see. Now, who were the

06:10.765 --> 06:13.469
key members of his staff? Well, Elmer Smith was his 
assistant coach. He hired Elmer Smith to come down

06:17.996 --> 06:22.122
here and coach. Elmer had been coaching up in 
Arkansas. And then he had B. Powell, who had played

06:25.647 --> 06:30.775
with him, and a guy named Bobby. Jimmy Bryant. He 
had a guy named Lloyd Taylor who's still here in

06:35.136 --> 06:38.679
college. He had a guy from over here at Franklin.

06:46.146 --> 06:52.411
A lot of his staff were played with him. Pauline, 
where's that picture of that coaching thing,

06:52.491 --> 06:56.274
honey? Let me see that. I can't remember some of 
those guys. I've got a picture. And he was... His

07:01.248 --> 07:03.150
staff was comparatively young. They were all 
young except Elmer, and Elmer was an old man. But

07:07.035 --> 07:10.480
Elmer had coached with Barry Bryant when he was 
here. And Barry Bryant left, went back home to

07:10.960 --> 07:14.505
Alabama, and Elmer went with him. Elmer wasn't 
happy there. He felt he made a mistake. So he came

07:17.629 --> 07:21.013
back, and he stayed with Paul Schmeier, Jim 
Meyers. And then when Elmer stayed with Fulberg

07:21.394 --> 07:26.360
here. And then, of course... Elmer told me, he 
said, Gene called him when he got the job. He said,

07:31.894 --> 07:33.176
Elmer, you come with me. We're going to have a 
dynasty at Texas A&M. Let me look here and see if I

07:36.420 --> 07:40.245
can see those guys. Now, in terms of... Here's that 
coaching staff right here. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:47.114 --> 07:48.055
Right here. The... He ran the same, did he run by and 
large the same offense and defense that Bryant had

07:51.620 --> 07:59.451
run? Yeah, I guess. I wasn't that familiar with 
that. Let me tell you about this stuff. Bear

08:04.879 --> 08:13.551
Bryant, Coach Bear Bryant, when he was at Texas 
A&M, he wore work shoes and he wore long khaki pants

08:04.879 --> 08:13.551
to practice. Stallings wore work shoes and long 
khaki pants. Stallings would not let any of his

08:17.096 --> 08:21.222
coaches wear shorts. on the practice field. 
Bryant didn't like it. I don't know how close

08:27.244 --> 08:33.331
Stalin tried to ape or mimic Bryant. Everybody 
says that because I didn't know Bear Bryant that

08:33.351 --> 08:35.674
well. But

08:36.435 --> 08:40.439
I don't know. They keep saying that's what hurt 
him. I'll tell you what hurt him, but I won't tell

08:45.105 --> 08:47.227
you on that thing. All right, let's go back to 
Bryant. because you observed Bryant up pretty

08:49.282 --> 08:52.426
close. Who selected Bryant to be the head coach? 
Okay, Mr. Penberthy was dean of, was head of the

08:56.371 --> 09:06.323
athletic council, and it was the athletic 
council's job to fire and hire the coach. Mr.

09:07.004 --> 09:14.133
Penberthy told me, he says, when the

09:07.004 --> 09:14.133
prior coach left. Norton? No, it was the second, 
and then the next one. But anyway, Mr. Penny, Mr.

09:19.235 --> 09:27.870
Penberthy said that he and his group were 
interviewing people like Blair at Army. They

09:28.270 --> 09:31.496
interviewed Oklahoma Coast. He said, we 
interviewed everybody we could. We didn't expect

09:34.741 --> 09:38.868
to get them, but when the word came out, why didn't 
you ask old Joe? Why didn't you ask him? We did. And

09:41.594 --> 09:51.087
he says, I pick up the paper and lo and behold, I see 
that Barry Bryant's been hired by the Board of

09:41.594 --> 09:51.087
Regents, Board of Directors. Was there, as far as 
you know, was there a particular board member? I

09:55.073 --> 09:57.837
don't even know who it was. At that time, I probably 
did, but I don't recall who it was. Not like when Bob

10:01.582 --> 10:03.765
Bryant hired you. Did... What was his first 
venture here? How did he arrive? He came in like a

10:12.806 --> 10:15.309
hurricane. He later said that he had heard that if 
you let the Aggies get too close to you, they'll

10:15.429 --> 10:23.717
stab you in the back. So he shut down all 
observation. He put a fence up where nobody could

10:26.279 --> 10:29.502
watch practice. My office at that time was in 
DeWare. And here came guys that I had known.

10:34.683 --> 10:43.652
driving up in the big Cadillac, they would park and 
come into my office, because they were kind of same

10:34.683 --> 10:43.652
age as me, and say, do you think, Coach, I can see 
Coach? They were even afraid to go down and try and

10:43.932 --> 10:53.782
see, because his office was on the west side of Kyle 
Field, up under the stands there, where the

10:43.932 --> 10:53.782
dressing room was on the other side. And one time, 
or several times, they'd go in there, and he'd say,

10:54.203 --> 10:59.789
did you bring me a crossbar? No, Coach, you bring me 
a crossbar, he won't come back to me. Everybody was

11:04.822 --> 11:07.104
scared to death. And he was in his 40s? 40ish? Yeah, 
he was a young man. Describe him physically. I'd

11:13.870 --> 11:18.334
say he was probably 6'2", but in most people's 
minds, he was about 6'10". And he was a well-built

11:18.354 --> 11:20.596
old boy. I've got a picture of him in there 
somewhere. At that time, the MSC was the main

11:24.160 --> 11:27.563
hangout. Well, you were here. No. Yeah. The 
hangout for coffee time. Everybody would go to

11:30.906 --> 11:32.407
coffee at the MSC. Maybe. Bryant walked in there. 
You go to a cafe, you go to a hotel, you go anywhere,

11:37.214 --> 11:46.505
and I'll swear that 99% of the conversations were 
about Bear Bryant every day. He dominated this

11:46.526 --> 11:48.628
place. You've heard the expression, he walks in 
the room and draws attention. Bryant walked like

11:51.491 --> 11:52.833
John Wayne. He walked in the room and drew 
attention and never said a word. Right now, he came

11:57.178 --> 12:01.103
early in the calendar year You know, soon after 
football season's over. And that first year, he

12:05.523 --> 12:14.113
had really good recruiting success in bringing in 
lots of freshmen. About 19 out of the top 20. I'll

12:16.236 --> 12:17.317
tell you a story about that. And then he took the 
varsity. He didn't take freshmen. He took the

12:21.923 --> 12:24.025
varsity to Junction, didn't he? Yes. Okay. Go 
ahead. Well, during the first year, he was 1-11, I

12:25.627 --> 12:28.710
think. And towards the end of the year, he just quit 
the varsity and took all of his freshmen. There's a

12:33.803 --> 12:37.127
story that Colonel Frank Anderson told me. Frank 
Anderson was track coach at Texas Indian for 48

12:38.068 --> 12:41.231
years. He came here in the teens with Mr. Bible as 
assistant coach with Mr. Bible. He and Mr. Bible

12:46.878 --> 12:48.500
were like brothers. Mr. Bible left and went to 
Nebraska, then came to Texas.

12:54.106 --> 13:03.777
Colonel Anderson told me that all the athletic 
directors got together one time in Austin with the

12:54.106 --> 13:03.777
intent of getting this done. Mr. Colonel Andy 
said, Mr. Bible walks in this room, Mr. Bible from

13:06.398 --> 13:21.580
Texas walks in this room and says to these other 
athletes, gentlemen, it's my understanding and

13:06.398 --> 13:21.580
order to leave a fellow member of the Southwest 
Conference. It must be unanimous. Is that being

13:22.922 --> 13:23.963
the case? And I'll contend that what you said, 
Texas University is the best university in the

13:25.666 --> 13:32.275
world. I agree with that. Nobody like, nearly 
hated him. Well, because he got old football

13:37.483 --> 13:38.926
players. He bought them all. No question about 
that. He bought John David. He bought Lloyd Paley.

13:43.634 --> 13:49.003
He bought everything inside.

13:51.347 --> 13:55.615
Describe what you know about the Junction. Or what 
everybody else knows. They went down there and two

13:57.558 --> 13:59.582
came back and won. I've heard scholars talk about 
it. I have a good friend named Dave Smith. Dave

14:05.872 --> 14:12.601
Smith is the only guy that went to Junction and left 
that became a head football coach later. Now, he

14:12.882 --> 14:18.870
took the sophomores, juniors, and seniors, not 
the freshmen. I didn't know that. Well, I'm

14:21.174 --> 14:22.095
guessing. I don't know. And a whole bunch of them 
dropped out. Well, it said, Dolly said in his

14:26.361 --> 14:32.108
little pocket, they went down in two buses and came 
back in one. What the guys told me, some of them that

14:32.468 --> 14:39.377
I talked to that left, they said we would leave at 
night. We'd crawl out the window and go to the

14:39.397 --> 14:44.183
highway and hitchhike to get out of there. And none 
of them had the I wouldn't have had either to go to

14:45.597 --> 14:49.103
Mr. Bryant and say, Coach, I can't handle this. I'm 
leaving. They'd be afraid to see me. But they just

14:51.808 --> 14:52.890
snuck off. And as you look back on it, do you think 
that most people believe that he deliberately

14:53.952 --> 15:03.709
wanted to drive some of those people off? I don't 
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know why he

15:06.361 --> 15:07.842
took them. He said in one of his books I read, he said 
he'd never do that again. Because he didn't do it

15:10.926 --> 15:12.828
but once did. Yeah, yeah. I don't think it panned 
out exactly. And didn't he lose some good

15:16.452 --> 15:18.635
prospects? Probably did. Probably lost a lot of 
people. He said, I'm not going to put stuff to that.

15:22.299 --> 15:23.080
You couldn't do it today. Yeah. Oh, no way. No, no. 
They probably lost six. If you talk to the guys that

15:26.724 --> 15:31.809
stayed and they think it's fantastic, the guys 
that left, they're ashamed. Yeah. So I don't know.

15:34.297 --> 15:37.341
All right. In the years that he was here, did he 
continue to be that kind of removed, separate

15:37.602 --> 15:46.874
person? He would not. That's what I know of it. He 
would not talk to anybody. The only friend he had,

15:52.422 --> 16:00.413
good, close friend, this guy's got this student 
factory out here, 121, big tag. He had a big home

16:00.433 --> 16:02.095
down north of Miami. Whatever that is. But Bryant 
did not. Bryant did not. Willie Zappalack was

16:06.805 --> 16:11.211
assistant coach, and Willie and I played 
together. He kept Willie Zappalack on the staff.

16:15.136 --> 16:16.838
Ray George was the guy that was for him. He was the 
only one that he kept, and he kept Willie because

16:16.958 --> 16:21.744
Willie's been an Aggie. He had connections with 
former students in that league for him. And Willie

16:25.092 --> 16:28.896
said that if they went on these tours, they'd be 
going for five weeks. And he said at night, he'd go

16:28.916 --> 16:31.858
to his room at night. He said, I had very little 
personal contact with him. Every one of his

16:34.781 --> 16:39.686
coaches kept a, I understand, they kept a bag 
packed in the office. He'd say, Barney, won't you

16:39.706 --> 16:43.609
go talk to him? He was a very demanding man, but I 
think the guys respected him. He could be mean.

16:50.876 --> 16:51.577
Yeah, Bernath. Oh, yeah, Bernath Concrete. 
That's right. And they were big buddies.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.335
B-E-R-N-A-T-S. I think that's the only great 
friend he had. And there was a guy at the North Gate

17:00.679 --> 17:04.063
that had a... I guess it was a restaurant that he'd 
go by there every morning and they'd call him. And

17:10.351 --> 17:12.374
let's see. During those years, Morgan was 
president part of those years, and then he left, so

17:13.135 --> 17:23.668
there was no strong administrative... authority 
like there would be with Rudder and later with Jack

17:24.138 --> 17:27.943
Williams. Let me tell you something. Here's what 
happened. You know the name Jones Ramsey. Is this

17:31.106 --> 17:31.987
going to happen? You're going to edit this. Wait, 
wait, wait. Let me turn this off. I said, no, sir, I

17:37.995 --> 17:40.077
don't want you to do that. I wasn't about to have you 
get off. This is the first thing. We've got a

17:42.680 --> 17:45.444
Saturday football game, and I get blamed for it. 
Well, thereafter, any time they had games

17:45.464 --> 17:54.094
scheduled in the office of G. Ronnie White, they 
would have a bunch of basketball where I used my

17:45.464 --> 17:54.094
footballs. He would have one of his coaches call me 
and ask me. Well, I was about to say no, but I did

17:57.689 --> 18:01.694
appreciate him calling me and asking me. He didn't 
step on little people. He just squashed big

18:03.356 --> 18:05.699
people, I guarantee you. Now, I've heard that 
Jerry Claiborne was the coach and member of the

18:06.000 --> 18:18.335
coaching staff who went to the faculty to talk 
about grades and so forth. Is that right? As you

18:19.252 --> 18:20.655
understand, is that correct? I don't know. I knew 
Jerry real well, but we played handball all the

18:21.256 --> 18:24.182
time. What I heard was that he would come to chat 
with them, that he was always very, very

18:24.202 --> 18:39.471
thoughtful, always very conscientious, always 
very kind, patient, and that quite often, as he

18:24.202 --> 18:39.471
would be chatting, he would check his watch, and 
he'd pull his pocket watch out, he would always

18:39.738 --> 18:42.321
flip his Phi Beta Kappa key. I don't know about 
that. Where they could see it. But he was a heck of a

18:45.545 --> 18:46.687
nice guy. And that he always gave them a very nice, 
positive impression, and that there was no

18:46.907 --> 19:02.086
high-handedness, that they got any impression of 
high-handedness from Coach Clayton. Yeah, yeah.

19:03.207 --> 19:04.469
Chris Brown, you know him? Sure, sure. He told me 
that... He says, I said before Bryant came here, he

19:08.105 --> 19:12.591
says he's not going to run me. He was sharing that 
with me. He's not going to run me. And he came on

19:16.155 --> 19:18.037
Bryant's biggest performance. He'd done 
anything Bryant. Bryant just charmed him to

19:19.339 --> 19:20.520
death. And Bryant did not. You talk to people and 
tell me one time that Bryant never talked to

19:22.483 --> 19:26.408
anybody. When they'd go recruit, Bryant didn't 
recruit. He just sat there. He just did it by

19:30.092 --> 19:32.475
osmosis, I guess. But he let other people build up 
his reputation.

19:39.368 --> 19:44.754
Now, were folks like you aware that he was about to 
leave? No. That was a complete lie. Well, let me

19:47.016 --> 19:48.057
back off. We thought that he was having trouble 
here because of recruiting. Mm-hmm. I think I was

19:57.363 --> 20:03.753
surprised when he says, when Mother calls, when 
you come back to Alabama. And there was mixed

20:03.773 --> 20:09.221
emotions about it, I think. Okay. All right, let's 
go back then now and do your student days. Okay.

20:16.512 --> 20:17.314
We're not freshmen. Let's see. You

20:18.055 --> 20:24.805
were telling me about why you came here in the first 
place. How did you get to College Station for that

20:25.105 --> 20:28.849
first visit? Darius Mosher. Darius Mosher's 
parents lived in Stephenville. I had never heard

20:33.914 --> 20:37.057
of Texas A&M until I was in high school. You know, 
I'd heard of it, but I didn't think about it. But I

20:39.939 --> 20:44.003
loved Darius Mosher like a big brother to me, and 
I'd never seen a big football game. I had gone to

20:44.083 --> 20:47.967
Fort Worth to see Sammy Ball, some old people play. 
But they brought me down here several times when we

20:47.987 --> 20:54.133
would come to watch A&M play, and I'd stay over in 
the dorm with a guy named Cecil Ballew, who played

20:54.822 --> 21:00.068
baseball here, who was later dean of men at 
Crawford State University. And I'd come down to

21:00.088 --> 21:10.260
them, and I came to A&M and watched some football 
games, and I got where I could tell each player just

21:00.088 --> 21:10.260
by the way he walked. You can't do that today. But 
they had some individual deals about them. So when

21:15.827 --> 21:22.635
I was being recruited by several schools, and I 
didn't know what to do, and I went to Rice because

21:23.729 --> 21:36.103
they recruited me strongly and actually a guy had 
offered me some help that his brother-in-law was

21:23.729 --> 21:36.103
mayor of Stephenville at that time. And so I went 
down there but it didn't turn out so I came back up

21:36.123 --> 21:39.147
here. The first time I just came down was Derrick 
Moser's parents. Right and so and you enrolled in

21:42.410 --> 21:45.033
the fall of? 1941. 41 and A&M's football program 
was very, very, very strong then. Yeah we won the

21:50.640 --> 21:53.483
conference that year and had won it. 39 were the 
champions. 40, they won it in 41. But in 38, they

21:58.467 --> 22:00.349
nearly got fired. If it hadn't been for Bert 
Clopper, it would have been, because he came to

22:00.749 --> 22:08.236
take care of, he wasn't at the time, because he was 
Martin's big boss. Okay. What was your, when you

22:09.938 --> 22:16.425
visited the campus first, what was your 
impression of the people you encountered? I was so

22:16.445 --> 22:19.968
scared to death my freshman year. I don't remember 
much, but I don't know that it was any different

22:21.509 --> 22:25.333
than anywhere else. I don't know. Most of the guys 
at that time were 60% or more of the boys would take

22:26.634 --> 22:32.721
them and work with them through school. Yeah, but 
did you think that this, when your first

22:32.941 --> 22:38.587
impression, did you think this was a friendly 
place? Yes, definitely. And the one thing that

22:39.968 --> 22:42.371
made it friendly, I think, was uniform. We had 
Jewish boys, we had Catholic boys, we had

22:43.071 --> 22:49.078
Protestant boys, we had rich boys, we had poor 
boys, but everybody was the same. The uniform

22:49.138 --> 22:51.280
leveled it out. I didn't have anything. My parents 
didn't have anything like most kids did. But we

22:55.745 --> 22:57.828
were well off the next day. And I have understood, 
after chatting with people like you and so forth

22:58.689 --> 23:16.812
and hearing the recollections, that those 
differences of background of religion,

22:58.689 --> 23:16.812
ancestry, and money almost vanished, you were, 
once you put on that uniform, once you became a

23:18.277 --> 23:24.425
member of the group. Yeah, you were an Aggie. And 
everybody got a nickname. What was your nickname?

23:29.212 --> 23:30.654
Well, I always went Barney. Barney is a nickname. 
Oh, it is? Okay. What is your? Fowler Barnett,

23:33.898 --> 23:38.965
B-A-R-N-E-T. Oh, Fowler Barnett. Fowler was my 
mother's maiden name. My first wife's father was a

23:41.649 --> 23:47.337
farmer, and he probably never saw an athletic 
contest in his life. Okay. And he was listening on

23:47.960 --> 23:53.488
the radio when I came down here, and they called me 
Fowler Wells. And he asked his daughter, he says,

23:53.508 --> 23:59.497
why is Barney Fowler so much? And I didn't know my 
name was Fowler until I got down here with the first

23:59.517 --> 24:03.523
tip. But I didn't have a nickname. Share with the 
machine some of the distinctive nicknames that

24:06.887 --> 24:17.022
you recall of either friends or Aggie nicknames of 
friends or faculty or anybody. I wish I had that.

24:19.585 --> 24:22.048
Pauline, where's that list I picked up one time? 
One time at our meeting, this meeting. I sat down

24:26.394 --> 24:30.961
and wrote down every faculty guy that I could think 
of. Let me give you these. Okay, first of all, there

24:34.626 --> 24:40.014
was Bigfoot Jackson. These are faculty. Did he 
have big feet? I guess, I don't know. Wheezy Clark.

24:47.731 --> 24:48.672
You know Wheezy Clark? Wheezy Clark was the guy. 
Let's go back to when Mr. Gilchrist was a civil

24:52.796 --> 24:55.920
engineer. There's a place over here called Billy 
Goat Bridge, right across from Pat Olsen's home.

25:00.905 --> 25:01.605
You know that lake? Pat, Mr. Gilchrist, had a city 
connection. He made them drain it because of

25:06.050 --> 25:08.453
Skeeter. Wheezy Clark had developed all that 
land. And that was the cause of that big rebellion

25:11.296 --> 25:14.599
and 20 years later over on the campus. Because 
Wheezy Clark and Mr. Bryan, Travis Bryan, hated

25:17.068 --> 25:21.733
Barry Bryan. I mean, Mr. Gilkins. Wheezy because 
he messed up on that play. And Mr. Bryan because

25:27.079 --> 25:34.087
when he built the College Station State Bank, 
Gilkins started putting money in there and taking

25:27.079 --> 25:34.087
Mr. Bryan. And they two instigated that thing with 
a guy named Sam Williams who was a student and a

25:34.187 --> 25:39.192
football player. And they're the guys that 
started that whole mess. Orster Joe Gammon.

25:45.190 --> 25:47.293
Gammon, yes, because he'd clear his throat. Big 
Track Buck. Notes Dance. Yes. Head End Jones.

25:54.503 --> 25:55.705
Steppin' Half Hedges. Screamin' Al Nelson. I had 
him in class. I know what he was. Jumpin' Jim

26:01.613 --> 26:03.475
Potter. Jim Potter. Oh. Dusty Colford. Mm-hmm. 
Cube Foot, Cube Root Kent. Cube Root Kent. Cube

26:11.987 --> 26:12.548
Root Kent. And Square Root Jackson. Yeah. Blue 
Brook Benton. Camp Basie, I don't know who that is.

26:22.566 --> 26:26.471
Dan the man, Dan the great point man, Dan Russell. 
Not Dan, Dr. Dan Russell. Dr. Dan, I had him in

26:28.634 --> 26:30.255
classes, yeah. Cigar Davis.

26:35.402 --> 26:42.450
But those were Smokey, now these are guys that I 
think were really ought to be settled. Bear

26:42.818 --> 26:49.168
Bryant, Smokey Harper, Dr. Dobbs, Ivy League 
Taylor. You remember him? He gave Stallings more

26:50.570 --> 26:53.975
to pay off. And he and I used to play tennis. You 
know, he'd press the tennis player one time. But

26:57.300 --> 27:00.105
he'd come up in the stands when we'd work now in 
college. He'd sit up there with his shirt off. And

27:01.888 --> 27:03.971
Stallings would pick it up for Grandma. He 
wouldn't leave. He was a faculty prop. Stallings

27:06.595 --> 27:11.222
hated that guy because he would go, oh, love, oh, 
love. Taylor would egg him on, and I understand he

27:11.540 --> 27:16.246
turned out to be one of those people. Nick 
Callahan, Bull Boatman, remember Boatman? Jocko

27:22.855 --> 27:29.404
Robertson,

27:22.855 --> 27:29.404
Jock Woods. These are some names we picked up. All 
right, what about some of your buddies, your

27:31.386 --> 27:34.611
classmates? Well, I'm trying to think. Most of 
them, let's see. Okay, Whiskey Cure. Let's get to

27:41.847 --> 27:43.049
Cure. Wayne Cure was a guy who played football at 
Tarleton, and they claimed he kept a little pint in

27:43.109 --> 27:51.963
his little pocket up there on his shirt, and he'd 
stick it through a straw. And I played with him,

27:52.684 --> 27:59.115
Wayne Cure, and gosh, I can't think. Let's see. All 
right, let me. I can't think of those guys. All

28:01.398 --> 28:02.660
right, were there any? Bill Henderson, Boots 
Henderson. Did the Jewish kids have a nickname? I

28:07.639 --> 28:08.120
don't know. Hispanic? No. I don't think they mean 
Hispanic either. Okay. Fat guys? Short guys?

28:16.395 --> 28:20.562
Jelly Steinman was an old boy from over here at 
Blastrop. Later he was a colonel and he was a fat

28:20.602 --> 28:24.630
boy, Jelly Steinman. And... Hank Goldberg was his 
nickname, his name was Henry. Of course, Buddy

28:29.767 --> 28:31.529
Denton was that dude.

28:34.712 --> 28:40.598
Do you agree with me that these nicknames, in fact, 
were terms of endearment? Yes, definitely were.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.381
They may have been kind of backhanded. Okay, your 
freshman year, where did you live? I lived over,

28:48.947 --> 28:54.193
the athletes lived together my freshman year, and 
we lived in dorm 12. over in what is now the court

28:54.933 --> 28:57.696
area. Did you have what we now call a scholarship? 
Yes, we had a full scholarship. We got room, board,

29:02.883 --> 29:07.268
bus, tuition, and $5 a month for London. Okay. And 
then about how much more money did you spend a

29:08.529 --> 29:14.456
month? $5. My parents would send me $5 a month. Oh, 
so $5 more. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And you came, that

29:21.848 --> 29:27.313
first fall, you arrived about what date? Probably 
1st or 2nd. So football practice started about

29:29.195 --> 29:30.656
that? We started practice immediately. And how 
many freshmen were there on the team? About 110.

29:36.061 --> 29:38.002
But there weren't that many on scholarship? Oh, 
no, no, no. And do you remember the routine of the

29:41.025 --> 29:45.029
first workouts? I remember the routine of 
everything. First of all, we would never go in the

29:47.050 --> 29:50.033
dressing room to the upperclassmen had left. 
Never. Because they'd get up there and beat our

29:52.376 --> 29:53.697
butts. And the coaches would sit there and watch 
you. And we would stay on the field until the

29:56.661 --> 30:01.427
upperclassmen had cleaned up and left and gone. 
But unfortunately, we all went back to the same

30:01.447 --> 30:05.332
dormitory. I cleaned up a room for a guy named 
Darius Moser, who's a dear friend of mine. And

30:10.038 --> 30:20.070
Jim...

30:10.038 --> 30:20.070
My routine every morning, I'd get up And I'd go up 
and clean their tunes. I'd shine their shoes. And

30:24.276 --> 30:27.682
unfortunately, one of them wanted to get up and one 
of them didn't. And so I'd have to wake one of them up

30:27.702 --> 30:30.287
and not wake the other up. I was going to get my butt 
beat the other way. Then I would take their laundry

30:32.752 --> 30:38.602
out and I would go over in the mess hall and bring the 
breakfast to them back and do it. Now that was every

30:38.623 --> 30:40.506
morning we did that. Was that kind of common? Oh, 
everybody, they had every upper class had room

30:42.244 --> 30:45.647
order. Well, I know that, but that bringing the 
meal back. If they wanted, you did what they

30:47.950 --> 30:49.692
wanted. And we just understood that's what you're 
supposed to do. Okay. Classes didn't begin until

30:55.037 --> 30:57.460
late in September. Did you all have two-a-day 
workouts? Yes, we worked out two days. And the head

31:01.745 --> 31:03.286
coach was Homer Norton. Homer Norton. Describe 
Coach Norton as a person. Well, Coach Norton as a

31:06.109 --> 31:08.772
fiscal or otherwise? Coach Norton was a very aloof 
man to me. Now, to some people he was not, but he did

31:14.420 --> 31:21.552
not, I think if he saw me on the street, he wouldn't 
know who I was. Never spoke to him, I don't guess. On

31:23.655 --> 31:24.677
the field, it was different. But I found out later 
that Coach Norton, his last year, this was, of

31:25.058 --> 31:31.468
course, a freshman, he didn't have any good 
management.
