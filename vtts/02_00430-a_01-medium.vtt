00:01.516 --> 00:09.125
13th, 1984, in the home of Roy Benavides, a Vietnam 
veteran.

00:12.368 --> 00:15.352
Chest one, two, three, chest one, two, three. Your 
life, how you, where you started and how you

00:17.514 --> 00:25.323
decided to go into the service and this type of 
thing? Well, I was born in Quirrell, right outside

00:25.343 --> 00:31.270
of Quirrell, in a small farm. in 1935, on August 
5th. And our parents, my brother and I, were

00:35.803 --> 00:41.690
orphans. Our parents died at an early age.

00:48.158 --> 00:53.624
And then after our parents died, we were adopted by 
an uncle named Hernel Campo. My brother and I came

00:54.825 --> 01:01.273
here in the mid-40s. And we started school here. I 
started school. And I lettered and tracked. And I

01:08.841 --> 01:14.989
was a Golden Glover, two-year Golden Glover for 
the state of Texas. I fought in

01:15.010 --> 01:21.358
Will Rogers Coliseum in Dallas. And then I decided 
to quit school. I was advised not to. My teachers,

01:29.389 --> 01:31.412
who still live here, I thought that I had a good head 
on my shoulder, and they didn't want to see me quit,

01:31.983 --> 01:44.519
but I was determined to make it out on my own. 
However, I could see that I need the education, but

01:45.820 --> 01:59.037
I was seeking adventure in a way that I was looking 
for some certain love, not that my My adopted

02:00.063 --> 02:08.933
parents didn't give it to me, but I guess the good 
Lord just selects people with this instinct.

02:08.953 --> 02:10.936
There was something you were searching for. Yes. 
And so I dropped out of school in the eighth grade,

02:11.777 --> 02:23.210
seventh grade, and I ran away from home. And I got 
hungry and came back. And I think I ran away a second

02:27.375 --> 02:29.918
time. but they caught me. And I was just searching 
for an adventure. I was just, I guess I was just that

02:34.913 --> 02:47.150
self-made youngster, you know, that had a mind of 
his own, that could turn things the way he wanted

02:34.913 --> 02:47.150
to. And I just couldn't wait to grow up. And the 
uniform fascinated me. This was something that I

02:57.184 --> 02:59.027
admired. looking at the World War II veterans and 
the Korean veterans when they came back. And I knew

03:07.949 --> 03:11.113
that this was for me. And I just couldn't wait to 
join some sort of branch of the service. But then I

03:19.403 --> 03:23.408
was told that I needed an education. Well, that in 
mind, I decided to join the Texas National Guard if

03:28.471 --> 03:40.103
they would accept it, which they did later when I 
became of age. But I had one goal in mind to seek an

03:40.123 --> 03:57.060
education in the high school diploma because I was 
told during

03:40.123 --> 03:57.060
those years that I was seeking enlistment in the 
military that without an education, And without a

03:57.260 --> 04:01.965
diploma, I didn't have a future. So that goes to say 
that without either, you don't have, that's the

04:01.985 --> 04:08.412
key to success. You don't have anything. And I had 
talked it over with my uncle, with my adoptive

04:11.215 --> 04:18.623
father who was disciplinary.

04:21.246 --> 04:25.410
So you found out that education was going to be an 
important part Very important. Well, later in the

04:27.021 --> 04:28.624
years. But you know, I was just a wild youngster. 
And I guess I was seeking a career and an adventure.

04:36.555 --> 04:43.565
But I didn't know the steps to look into this. And 
thank God that I had a lot of friends that took a lot

04:43.585 --> 04:55.262
of interest in me here in El Campo and in the 
military.

04:56.187 --> 05:03.556
especially here,

04:56.187 --> 05:03.556
I joined the Texas National Guard. I had a job, you 
know, had a job, and I was doing good. But I joined

05:07.461 --> 05:15.731
the Texas National Guard because I wanted to have 
the feeling of the uniform. I wanted the

05:16.392 --> 05:25.823
challenge, you know, to be given orders, to see if I 
could cope with wearing the uniform. And that is a

05:26.343 --> 05:29.247
great challenge, you know. In the Texas National 
Guard, which I advise anyone now to join any unit,

05:29.867 --> 05:46.368
reserve or Texas National Guard, Air Force, 
Guard, you go to summer camp for two weeks, you

05:29.867 --> 05:46.368
know, you become a soldier for two weeks. You 
become a soldier in active duty once a month, you

05:46.388 --> 05:53.076
know, and then you go on maneuvers. And this, I was 
breaking myself into to being what I wanted to be.

06:00.896 --> 06:02.197
And I liked it. And after two years, well, I went to 
school to Fort Knox, Kentucky. And I got to live in a

06:09.625 --> 06:17.373
regular military barracks with regular army men 
and everything. And hearing the trumpets, you

06:18.474 --> 06:20.937
know, go up and and playing Reveille at 6 o'clock in 
the morning and playing tab to 10 o'clock at night,

06:21.322 --> 06:28.330
Lifetime and everything. And I just loved it. And 
this was for me. This was for me. Military life was

06:34.196 --> 06:36.158
like a second love for you. Yeah, so I just couldn't 
wait to just come back and say, hey, look, I want to

06:36.198 --> 06:43.727
join the Red Army. But then, when I was there at Fort 
Knox, Kentucky, on active duty, I met some

06:51.595 --> 06:54.420
paratroopers. And here in El Campo, I met some, uh, 
Mr. Kinehart, Colonel Kinehart and, uh, and, uh,

06:54.440 --> 07:02.112
Garrett and Mr. Colonel Garrett and, and others 
that had been in the Airborne during World War II in

07:02.132 --> 07:07.782
Korea. And I wanted to join the Airborne. I wanted 
to be a paratrooper because I learned that the more

07:16.992 --> 07:22.719
qualifications you have, the better off you'll be 
if you're going to make the Army career. However,

07:22.739 --> 07:24.741
you need that education. You need that high school 
diploma. And I just couldn't wait to get back to El

07:27.945 --> 07:35.034
Campo to quit the National Guard to go back into 
active duty. And I did. I came back and I told my

07:37.156 --> 07:44.485
uncle, of course, you know, I come from a very 
disciplinary family. My uncle was the deputy

07:44.819 --> 07:50.007
sheriff of Horton County for over 30 years. I'm 
calling him . And you had to be of age, you know, to

07:52.951 --> 07:56.196
leave that. The old Hispanic costume, you know, 
had to be 21 years of age. Heck, even the older

08:00.923 --> 08:11.518
brothers, cousins, they were 21, 22, they didn't 
even smoke in front of me. You know, that's how much

08:12.224 --> 08:16.410
respect we had for one another. And the girls, they 
didn't date. So... A lot of things have changed

08:19.814 --> 08:25.722
today, haven't

08:19.814 --> 08:25.722
they? Oh, my God. A tremendous change. I guess you 
might say it was a turnover. Complete turnover.

08:32.672 --> 08:33.293
Turnaround. 180 degrees. So when I came back, you 
know, I just casually...

08:42.599 --> 08:46.463
told my uncle that I was going to the active duty. 
But I had one goal in mind. How old were you when you

08:49.526 --> 08:52.189
went into active duty? I was 18, 18 when I went to 
active duty. And I had that one goal in mind to keep

08:55.513 --> 09:00.638
my high school diploma. Which it turned out to be, I 
had, I'd say rough times. The military or the

09:09.430 --> 09:15.058
airborne, or ranger trained, or special forces, 
whatever training. It's only as hard as you want it

09:15.078 --> 09:17.881
to be. Well, back then, was there much 
discrimination toward being that you were

09:18.142 --> 09:25.351
Hispanic or toward black? Was there a lot of 
discrimination, or was the military? Well, there

09:28.656 --> 09:30.358
was. But not as much as in civilian life? Well, 
there was. In some way, you could feel it, but then

09:37.308 --> 09:41.833
you were in uniform. Because remember, you take an 
oath. And any man that takes an oath to serve his

09:44.395 --> 09:59.912
country, to take orders from officers or 
non-commissioned officers,

09:44.395 --> 09:59.912
there is a pride within him. So therefore, 
irregardless whether you come from the South,

09:59.932 --> 10:05.678
North, or east or west, you know, you have that 
pride and you took that oath. I saw some

10:13.418 --> 10:26.617
discrimination, and I felt some at times, but I've 
proven to myself and to others, you know, that I was

10:13.418 --> 10:26.617
a defender of this country and I'm an American. And 
I felt proud to be an American. I served with some,

10:29.522 --> 10:33.167
so to speak, rednecks, And I served with some 
blacks that hated redneck. And I served with some

10:39.046 --> 10:42.472
Hispanics that hate Hispanic. Not hate, but then 
they were what we would call in those days

10:43.653 --> 10:50.464
coconuts. Brown on the outside and white on the 
inside. And I served with all of them. The

10:58.780 --> 11:14.945
presentation that you make to this individual, 
the professionalism that you display,

10:58.780 --> 11:14.945
I have a plaque right there that I committed a very 
serious offense one day at one time. And it was so

11:15.787 --> 11:21.035
serious that I could have gone to jail. I could have 
been going to the penitentiary for 15 years. And I

11:25.763 --> 11:30.090
have lived by that motto of duty, honor, and 
country. And I later found out what that duty,

11:30.110 --> 11:36.400
honor, and country meant. That a man should not 
cheat, lie, or steal, or tolerate those that do.

11:44.754 --> 11:45.655
And that was me. That, to me, was what I was looking 
for in the military. And that is the motto of

11:53.017 --> 11:59.525
Westman, a cadet in the military academy. So I have 
lived by that. And now I'm an adopted graduate of

12:01.547 --> 12:05.232
that academy. I have a saber, a graduated saber. To 
become a professional soldier is something that I

12:09.737 --> 12:20.830
always look forward to, just like anyone else here 
in life. You know, you're a student. You want to be

12:22.885 --> 12:27.692
the best, and I hope you'll be. Any individual that 
seeks employment in General Motors, or IHOP, or

12:27.852 --> 12:38.106
CP&L, he's going to be the best. And he's going to 
live by some standards that he sets. And he sets his

12:43.013 --> 12:45.596
goals, and he's going to reach them. Well, I set my 
goals, and I set my standards. And I set a model that

12:49.542 --> 12:51.745
I live by. I did.

12:57.453 --> 13:00.777
How long were you in the service before you went to 
Vietnam? Well, let's see. I joined the National

13:03.720 --> 13:10.909
Guard in 1951 and 1952, later part of 1951. And I 
joined the active duty in 1955. And I completed

13:15.674 --> 13:18.377
basic training. Then I went to Korea in later part 
of 1955. Where did you do your basics? I went

13:25.726 --> 13:33.313
through Beckett training at Fort Royal, 
California, and at Fort Carson, Colorado. In

13:33.654 --> 13:42.042
fact, in Fort Carson, I met...

13:42.062 --> 13:51.651
I

13:42.062 --> 13:51.651
met also the... Tony Morton? No, not Tony Morton. 
The manager for the New York Giants. He was a hop

13:58.219 --> 14:00.142
head. I mean a hard head. Excuse me. And Farron 
Young, I met him there. He was taking back the

14:08.192 --> 14:11.937
training. And then I went to Korea in

14:11.957 --> 14:19.107
the latter part of 1955. I came back in 58 and I went 
to Berlin, to Honey Anchor, and I served there 57,

14:19.863 --> 14:32.122
58. I came back in 59 and I met the lady, Elvis 
Presley, in Orchapa, Arkansas. And he was going to

14:43.100 --> 14:47.527
Beijing train there, getting a haircut. I imagine 
that was a shock for him. Well, I didn't even know

14:51.333 --> 15:00.948
that he'd become a star.

15:00.968 --> 15:07.979
And then from there, I went to Fort

15:00.968 --> 15:07.979
Gordon, Georgia, a military police school. I 
graduated second in my class. And incidentally,

15:12.850 --> 15:41.305
the men that I was supposed to graduate first, but 
because of my professionalism, I guess, because

15:12.850 --> 15:41.305
of the standards that I've set, and they couldn't, 
my men couldn't follow or meet up to them, I got some

15:12.850 --> 15:41.305
physical contact with one of them, and so that kept 
me from being the first undergraduate. And my

15:45.167 --> 15:53.716
buddy, Arnie Treville, who graduated first, he's 
an FBI agent.

15:53.736 --> 15:57.080
I served with the military police in Fort Bowen, 
Georgia. Then I drove for the commander in

15:57.100 --> 16:00.504
general. I was selected to drive for him. Then I 
went airborne.

16:09.365 --> 16:16.693
I remember what the non-commissioned officer 
told me about the more qualifications you have,

16:09.365 --> 16:16.693
the better off you are in the military. And I was 
going to school during those times. I was going to

16:19.737 --> 16:22.700
take in my GED. But because of duty, you know, and 
going out to the field and everything, that was

16:24.322 --> 16:30.750
kind of hard. And I only had a few more, oh, I guess 
about eight hours to get my diploma. And I put in for

16:41.319 --> 16:47.006
airborne, which I always wanted to go airborne. 
But because I was driving for the commanding

16:47.026 --> 16:52.494
general, I didn't have the time. And I finally got 
accepted to go airborne, to go to the 82nd Airborne

16:52.674 --> 17:02.007
Division of Fort Bend, North Carolina. And then I 
was married in 1959.

17:07.938 --> 17:14.646
In fact, today, we were just talking about the 
date, because we just had some friends

17:07.938 --> 17:14.646
celebrating the 20th anniversary. And I couldn't 
remember my date. So please don't ask me. I think it

17:20.133 --> 17:24.278
was June the 7th in 1959. And

17:24.398 --> 17:34.091
we lived in Fort Bragg, North Carolina for 15 
years, off and on. I was stationed there with 82nd

17:34.191 --> 17:37.675
Airborne Division. I finally completed my high 
school and I got my diploma.

17:45.170 --> 17:51.860
And then I joined the Special Forces, the Green 
Berets, which later was known as the Green Berets.

17:53.202 --> 17:56.527
Then it wasn't when they were training. I went 
through some real rough, rough training. But I

17:59.591 --> 18:01.033
enjoyed it and I loved it. The better, the harder it 
was, the better I loved it. Then I went to, well, I

18:07.304 --> 18:23.002
traveled to the South and went to the United States 
on assignment, often on

18:07.304 --> 18:23.002
a train assignment. I went to Vietnam

18:23.022 --> 18:30.011
in 1955, as an advisor. And I was an advisor to a 
Vietnamese infantry battalion, airborne

18:30.031 --> 18:34.396
infantry battalion. One of the very hardest jobs 
that I ever had. I say hard is because I didn't know

18:37.612 --> 18:58.844
the language and I knew my job, but it was hard to 
perform your duties through an interpreter to

18:37.612 --> 18:58.844
other people and to live their life, to follow 
their customs. It was very hard. We were in the war,

19:02.911 --> 19:04.513
the United States was committed. And then the 
United States would not accept our presence

19:04.831 --> 19:14.823
there. So this was entirely different for 
professional soldiers. Did the soldiers over

19:16.004 --> 19:25.495
there, how did they feel about, you know, because 
most of the people in America were against the war,

19:16.004 --> 19:25.495
you know. Was it hard on the morale of the soldiers 
in Vietnam? It was hard in a way in terms of the war

19:30.621 --> 19:34.686
that the American people had no support for us. And 
to us, it seems that we're just as Americans as they

19:40.718 --> 19:47.504
are. And here we are here, and my uncle and aunt, my 
father and mother would not accept me, would not

19:47.524 --> 19:55.652
come back again. You know, I feel like a traitor. I 
feel like, hey, Jerk, what are you doing in your

20:03.607 --> 20:05.269
uniform? You know, all the other soldiers 
returning from World War I and World War II,

20:05.830 --> 20:19.346
everybody came back and there was, you know, but 
the Vietnam soldiers didn't get the same

20:05.830 --> 20:19.346
reception, did they, as the other soldiers from 
the other wars? No, we didn't get that same

20:19.406 --> 20:21.989
respect. But, you know, in later times, I've 
learned that

20:22.189 --> 20:32.922
the American public, that the American people, 
They just got too much education, not enough

20:33.695 --> 20:38.323
common sense. Do you think the media has a lot... 
Well, uh... Has...can...can...

20:38.343 --> 20:46.637
You know, make the... The news media, yeah. They 
did that in a sense, but let me tell you. The news

20:52.446 --> 20:59.398
media was spreading the word out only according to 
what the public wanted to hear. You know, I work

21:00.728 --> 21:14.947
with intelligence, and I don't want to give myself 
away, because with the Green Berets, you know, we

21:00.728 --> 21:14.947
talked, we, uh, held a lot, we conducted a lot of 
international missions and everything. But

21:14.967 --> 21:24.360
this, this society, this modern society, knew 
what we were doing. They wouldn't accept it

21:24.701 --> 21:26.483
because The legislators would not let the public 
know exactly what they wanted us to do there.

21:35.153 --> 21:38.458
Nobody knew the real reason y'all were there. It 
was the legislators in Washington that committed

21:38.618 --> 21:53.820
us there, which the public was entitled to know 
where we were committed to because They are the

21:54.340 --> 21:56.503
taxpayers. They are the people that elect the 
legislature.

22:03.271 --> 22:20.533
You know, at times, I just wonder, of course, I'm 
writing my autobiography now, and part of it will

22:03.271 --> 22:20.533
come in my story, but I just wonder if any of these 
big corporations didn't have so much interest It

22:21.863 --> 22:23.766
was big money for them. That's right. And so, in a 
way, we were protecting their interests.

22:33.822 --> 22:37.648
War always meant money for the industry. Yeah, 
because of the reproduction of material and

22:38.089 --> 22:43.438
everything. The economy always went up during a 
war. you know, the extra production of materials

22:48.138 --> 22:53.018
needed.
