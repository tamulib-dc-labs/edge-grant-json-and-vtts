WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:29.160
Each of us works so

00:02.765 --> 00:29.160
much alone as we travel around the state and work 
intensively with one student as chair that

00:02.765 --> 00:29.160
sometimes the five of us don't interact a whole lot 
together enough to keep our feet out of our mouths,

00:02.765 --> 00:29.160
hopefully. Although we've had a time or two of 
that, too. And you have the smallest group in the

00:33.225 --> 00:36.829
whole college, right? We've asked for a sixth job 
line for the next budget year. Sure,

00:41.734 --> 00:52.764
with that amount of graduates here,

00:41.734 --> 00:52.764
that's hard. Was there anything else in the way of 
an insider? observation, an anecdote, anything

00:57.237 --> 01:05.047
that stands out that happened that might be of 
interest that would not be in any of the documents.

01:05.127 --> 01:09.854
It's just strictly a personal thing comes to mind. 
OK. On the culture of the college, and this is not a

01:10.334 --> 01:16.622
question that I've been asking. It just came about 
through this paper. The beliefs, the feelings,

01:19.907 --> 01:24.713
the values, the perceptions of people. What did 
you feel about the culture? And I guess you can't

01:27.140 --> 01:34.929
have one for the whole college because every 
single floor or every single department is so

01:27.140 --> 01:34.929
different. You would have a department culture, 
or in our case, you'd have an adult ed culture and an

01:35.189 --> 01:41.677
ed tech culture. And once in a while, the loops will 
overlap. But there is a big balloon that is the

01:45.942 --> 01:53.772
College of Education in terms of belief systems. 
When Karian came and he was first pushing the idea

01:54.832 --> 02:10.769
of inquiry groups and wanted to, he said he wanted 
to do away with departmental lines and have

01:54.832 --> 02:10.769
different kinds of alliances, which makes a lot of 
sense. And everybody sort of, because he was so

02:12.791 --> 02:24.703
different from Hubert, everybody sort of stood 
and looked at him for about a year and said, uh-huh.

02:25.291 --> 02:28.717
And then sort of tried to make the inquiry thing 
work. And it ran out of steam.

02:38.112 --> 02:38.733
What do you think? Was it just a lack of time, lack of 
enthusiasm? What combination? Or leadership?

02:45.364 --> 02:51.855
Because I know a lot of people have talked about it, 
and there's a lot of written material on the

02:45.364 --> 02:51.855
inquiry groups. but none on why it's fizzling or 
has

02:52.443 --> 02:59.493
fizzled. That's a difficult thing to look at. For 
one thing, the annual inquiry days have been

03:03.439 --> 03:09.909
continued whether there was a need for them or not. 
And so orders have gone forth saying, thou shalt

03:10.670 --> 03:17.320
attend if you are intact. The first year, or the 
first couple of years, everybody went with the

03:17.722 --> 03:27.757
kind of excitement, or at least most people went 
with a sort of excitement. And I don't know. I

03:31.222 --> 03:47.206
think, in all honesty, sometimes it seems that the 
dean is perhaps preoccupied or very busy with

03:31.222 --> 03:47.206
other things and not really paying attention to 
what's happening at home. At home? at in the

03:47.928 --> 03:49.670
college. In the college, OK. And I realize that he 
is pulled in a lot of ways with national and

03:49.690 --> 03:59.058
international responsibilities. And so that. 
But sometimes it seems like nobody's riding their

03:59.999 --> 04:02.541
horse. OK, that was that into the decision making 
part.

04:09.748 --> 04:17.935
Is there a feeling then that vagueness as to who is 
making the decisions or riding the horse, as you

04:09.748 --> 04:17.935
put it very well? If it wasn't for Brian Cole, I'm 
not sure that many, well, I will go ahead and say

04:18.522 --> 04:28.473
that I'm not sure that many things would be done.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.197
I think he's riding the horse. A lot. Now, I do not 
know, I'm not privy to the degree to which he'd

04:35.901 --> 04:47.314
carve and see eye to eye on a lot of things, because I 
don't go to the policy committee except when Don's

04:35.901 --> 04:47.314
out of town and things of that nature. But I think, 
from my perception, there seems to be somewhat of a

04:48.188 --> 04:57.158
vacuum in the leadership at the top. And I have to 
also say, because I've been on the tenure advisory

04:57.178 --> 05:07.088
committee for the college and I'm chair this year, 
that I have watched Currigan agonize over the

04:57.178 --> 05:07.088
decisions. We're not an extra layer of approval. 
We are there to advise and assist the dean in making

05:10.652 --> 05:16.238
his recommendations. Are you talking about the 
tenure? Tenure and promotion. Your chairman,

05:20.586 --> 05:23.790
what is the committee name again? Tenure and 
Promotion Advisory Committee, TAPC. Several

05:28.437 --> 05:42.276
years ago, I guess it was about four or five years 
ago, the Faculty Advisory Committee of the

05:28.437 --> 05:42.276
college, by lots of discussions and so forth, 
decided that there ought to be this group And the

05:44.247 --> 05:49.374
idea was taken to the policy committee, and they 
approved it. And the first year, Jerry Capus and

05:49.394 --> 05:57.684
Ernie Getz and I were elected. You have to be 
tenured and so forth. And we drew straws. And I lost

06:04.113 --> 06:08.398
and got the three-year straw. But we rotate so that 
whoever's on for the third year, the third year of

06:09.340 --> 06:16.429
their term, they're automatically chaired. So 
that I'm chair this year, Hurley's chair next

06:16.449 --> 06:22.257
year, McNamara's chair the year after that, and we 
elect one each year. And no two from any one

06:22.978 --> 06:24.760
department. That's just for the tenure and 
promotion? Tenure and promotion. And what we do is

06:27.523 --> 06:34.993
read all the stuff that the departments send 
forward to the dean, and then try to think of any

06:35.699 --> 06:43.610
relevant, pertinent, or impertinent question 
which we ought to raise with the dean regarding the

06:35.699 --> 06:43.610
information, but we do not have any vote or any say. 
Nor should we. It's not our role. So the ultimate

06:47.835 --> 06:49.858
say is the dean's? The ultimate say is the dean's. 
And I've watched him agonize over these things,

06:52.261 --> 07:02.635
and I have become, though I'm not often impressed 
by department heads just categorically, I am

07:02.800 --> 07:12.818
impressed with the care and concern they give to 
the letters they write recommending or not

07:02.800 --> 07:12.818
recommending somebody's position. Most of them 
have a department committee, and that

07:14.501 --> 07:22.635
recommendation comes forward, and then the 
department head's recommendation comes

07:14.501 --> 07:22.635
forward. And the dean looks at it. as he said over 
and over, and I've now watched him two years, and I

07:25.852 --> 07:39.772
really think he means this, that he looks at these 
things from the perspective of, if this person was

07:25.852 --> 07:39.772
not a faculty member of the college, how would we 
miss what that person contributes? From that

07:41.794 --> 07:47.643
perspective, he makes his recommendation, and 
sometimes it agrees with the departments, and

07:41.794 --> 07:47.643
sometimes it doesn't. If that person was not here, 
in what ways would we miss him or her? From the

07:54.657 --> 07:56.099
college level. Right. He expects the department 
to look at it from the discipline level, both

07:56.359 --> 08:02.749
locally and nationally. And they know that. And 
does that criteria work pretty well? It seems to.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.282
It seems to. Then it goes forward to the provost's 
office, and they look at it from still a different

08:13.103 --> 08:17.970
perspective. Which, do you know what that is? I 
would say funding, research, teaching, service.

08:28.269 --> 08:29.910
But then that's my bias again. I think although the 
words they use aren't that. Everybody was nervous

08:33.434 --> 08:38.019
as a cat when McDonald became provost.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.142
An engineer? A non-pupil person. We don't know yet 
what he's like. And the communication, what has

08:47.712 --> 08:51.155
that changed, the communication between? The 
communication comes in an annual memo from Kent

08:51.175 --> 09:05.269
Phillips, known as the Phillips Memo, which sets 
forth the procedures that will be followed for the

08:51.175 --> 09:05.269
recommendations for tenure and promotion that 
year. And they vary a little each year. Now, does

09:10.895 --> 09:17.061
every department have very, very specific

09:10.895 --> 09:17.061
delineated criteria, because I have only seen 
one. And I haven't been asking, but one particular

09:19.457 --> 09:22.420
department shared it with me. And it was, I mean, 
pages and pages of everything that has to be done.

09:26.344 --> 09:28.266
There is a notebook that you can see. It's in every 
office. This is what we did the first year of the

09:29.347 --> 09:32.330
TAPC. We visited with each faculty. We found out 
what the procedures were. If there were not

09:38.175 --> 09:42.720
procedures, we yelled and screamed until 
procedures were written. We compiled a book of

09:42.740 --> 09:45.883
them for the college. gave each office, each 
department office, a copy of the book and a brief

09:46.319 --> 09:55.408
summary of the thing to each faculty member. We 
called meetings of the assistant professors for

09:56.109 --> 10:00.933
them to talk about what they're worried about. Had 
the dean there. We called a meeting with the

10:02.695 --> 10:05.978
associate professors, but it got canceled. So I 
don't know when we're going to do that again. But

10:07.680 --> 10:15.027
we've been working to try to be sure that people 
understand the basis on which they will be judged.

10:15.445 --> 10:17.247
That's general for the college. Does every 
department in itself have a separate one? That's

10:20.691 --> 10:22.013
what's in that notebook. Oh, and are they pretty 
uniform among departments? Are they very

10:25.457 --> 10:26.678
different? Because they need to be. The 
departments are different. The disciplines are

10:29.822 --> 10:31.224
different. So that is something that you got input 
from each department? A faculty of five is

10:33.446 --> 10:35.308
different from a faculty of 51. Yes, every 
department has it. No. Okay, so there is a book that

10:39.399 --> 10:41.983
I can get all of them together. Yeah, if anybody 
gives you any hassle, come up. I've got a copy of the

10:44.426 --> 10:46.069
whole thing. But there should be one in every 
office, every apartment. Very good. And, of

10:51.977 --> 11:00.049
course, we already talked a little bit about, 
well, you said a little bit about what you wished or

10:51.977 --> 11:00.049
would like to see the future hold. What 
realistically do you think might be happening in

11:00.721 --> 11:04.385
the College of Education? I think inertia. I only 
learned one thing in high school physics, and

11:05.986 --> 11:08.649
that's inertia. A moving body tends to continue in 
the direction in which it's moving.

11:16.517 --> 11:17.858
Oh, is that upward, hopefully? No. No? The whole 
college isn't? I don't know. I see it more level

11:25.086 --> 11:27.488
enough. I don't think it's down. I think it's 
level. Just grind on the way it's going. Because

11:34.508 --> 11:43.438
the damn daily takes time and energy away from 
somebody jamming fist into the machinery and

11:34.508 --> 11:43.438
saying, look, let's look at this. Although, I'm 
sure people are looking at what the legislation

11:43.458 --> 11:50.566
means to the college. Well, it will impact the 
undergraduate a lot more than it would anyway. So

11:55.212 --> 11:57.154
yours is probably not going to be as good. Do you see 
the IDD department or what did you call it? It's an

12:02.913 --> 12:04.915
administrative unit. Unit becoming a department 
any time? No. The politics of higher ed in Texas is

12:08.159 --> 12:17.029
such that I don't believe it will ever be put 
forward as a department. It really gives them a

12:17.289 --> 12:23.457
direct deal of flexibility if it isn't.

12:25.399 --> 12:26.500
The trouble is, Some of the dean's staff, when I 
have gone to policy committee, they will talk

12:26.581 --> 12:37.516
about the five departments, and they'll have five 
copies of stuff. And number six is sitting there

12:37.536 --> 12:44.306
saying, can we see a copy of that?

12:47.911 --> 12:52.858
One of them especially does that rather 
consistently, and it's not Brian Cohen. That's

12:53.615 --> 12:56.580
interesting. We think so, too. So there's a 
message there of one kind or another. Now, where

13:01.207 --> 13:09.320
does this adult ed and all the things that are in 
IDED in College of Education at A&M, where do they

13:01.207 --> 13:09.320
fit in in other colleges? What are they a part of, or 
how are they? Some of them are in departments of

13:12.766 --> 13:15.169
administration. That's for administration of 
education. That's where it was at BU where I took

13:17.673 --> 13:19.977
mine. Some are in adult and continuing education.

13:31.947 --> 13:33.089
It varies. There are about 50 adult ed programs in 
North America.

13:40.279 --> 13:43.744
Where does the A&M program fit in? In that 50, do you 
have any? Pretty high. In spite of the fact that we

13:49.589 --> 13:58.382
don't have any national scholarships and 
therefore have trouble recruiting nationally,

13:49.589 --> 13:58.382
we do most of our recruiting in the state of Texas. 
But we've had a number of students, well, one guy

13:59.744 --> 14:11.862
from Canada, some from other countries, who come 
and say, well, you know, I want in this program

13:59.744 --> 14:11.862
because I think it's the best. Of course, we think 
it's the best. Have you... Do you have to do a lot

14:13.985 --> 14:16.609
of... aggressive recruiting, or are the students 
not coming to you in great numbers? Our students

14:21.407 --> 14:23.128
are our best recruiters. We're going to shoot some 
of them if they keep dragging in students. We've

14:25.991 --> 14:28.414
had to put a limit here in San Antonio. Is that a 
problem? It's the size of class. That's a good

14:34.000 --> 14:36.182
problem, I guess. It's not true in Corpus or El 
Paso, but we have a viable group in each place. How

14:43.350 --> 14:46.393
did the loss of two of your five faculty members at 
one time affect the continuity or the flow of the

14:46.812 --> 14:52.060
department? Were you able to, were the new people 
able to? We had to cancel only one class. But we

15:01.215 --> 15:02.377
covered all the rest.

15:07.705 --> 15:12.212
The hardest part has been inheriting chairs of 
committee. Because Ken and Adrienne are coming on

15:12.665 --> 15:22.817
fast, but it takes a while to catch on to all the 
bureaucratic Mickey Mouse that goes with this

15:12.665 --> 15:22.817
job.

15:24.079 --> 15:29.365
So this December, five people who my chair will 
graduate. Two were mine, two were Gary's, one was

15:30.466 --> 15:33.029
Bob's. You can't say no. It

15:35.392 --> 15:40.258
gets a little hairy. Before I turn off the tape, we 
continue. Is there anything that you'd like to

15:45.374 --> 15:48.918
summarize or end with? In spite of the fact that my 
first year on this faculty was the hardest year of

15:49.399 --> 16:03.674
my employed career for lots of complicated 
reasons, I really liked working here. It turned

16:03.694 --> 16:05.536
out to be the best job I ever had. And if I could have 
found a way to quit that first year, I would have.

16:13.077 --> 16:17.669
But I couldn't because of family commitments 
here. But I'm glad I couldn't. Never mind. Very

16:20.536 --> 16:20.978
good. I thank you for sharing all these insights 
with me. And if I have some additional questions, I

16:24.266 --> 16:27.916
hope that you let me come back. Oh, sure.
