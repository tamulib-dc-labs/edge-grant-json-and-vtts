WEBVTT

00:01.853 --> 00:02.874
I found my name on it. Well, the old man says,

00:02.995 --> 00:09.704
I don't know what we're going to do. He was pulling 
my leg because he knew the whole story by then. Then

00:17.875 --> 00:21.099
the... Well, what happened? Nothing. They just 
took the bomb site and left us alone. They had us a

00:25.325 --> 00:29.751
little worried there for a week, ten days, 
something like that.

00:33.764 --> 00:37.729
Then the North African invasion started.

00:39.171 --> 00:55.152
And

00:39.171 --> 00:55.152
it had been going on, and they had been struggling 
down on the complete opposite end of the United

00:39.171 --> 00:55.152
Kingdom, down the land's end. And the pirates 
would be in London, Our old man up there in

01:00.258 --> 01:04.642
Prestwick said, OK, we want you to go down there and 
take over. And from three different locations, we

01:04.662 --> 01:13.771
were dispatching fighters to go down and get in the 
act. And this was about

01:13.791 --> 01:21.918
January, February, I guess, of 43.

01:26.663 --> 01:28.965
And he said, OK, but I want to take certain people 
with me and all right just don't just don't pull the

01:29.232 --> 01:58.682
whole outfit down because we're going to have to 
replace it so he i was the first 20 name he said i want

01:29.232 --> 01:58.682
you to go and so we were lucky the we he and i flew down 
and those enlisted personnel and the vehicles

01:29.232 --> 01:58.682
that he wanted to go down had to go by road and i don't 
know how much you know about the united kingdom but

01:29.232 --> 01:58.682
long about the time they got uh Truro and kept 
heading south, well, road signs started

01:59.438 --> 02:08.991
disappearing and every time you'd ask, they'd ask 
for instructions. Well, they may get the right

02:09.131 --> 02:20.886
instructions, they may not because the people 
were beginning to get leery, you know, and they

02:09.131 --> 02:20.886
didn't know whether they were Yanks or whether 
they were German looking like Yanks or what. It

02:20.926 --> 02:27.555
took the convoy about a week or ten days longer than 
they should have just to find their way in. But then

02:28.531 --> 02:33.818
when we did get in and got set up, it was a real good 
operation. And as long as we were sending

02:33.918 --> 02:44.051
lightning down, that was all right. Because those 
boys had two engines. But any time we'd send a

02:45.813 --> 02:49.358
single engine aircraft flight down. Down to North 
Africa? Down to North Africa. We just prayed the

02:53.911 --> 03:00.838
whole time because he had about flight time plus 10 
minutes, and that's all he had. To make the trip. To

03:01.419 --> 03:01.919
make it, you know. And it got pretty hairy. Did you 
lose a lot of things? Oh, yeah. The fact is we even

03:07.685 --> 03:19.237
lost some that plotted getting to Lisbon, turn 
left, you know. Never try to make it. Just get to

03:20.258 --> 03:22.720
Lisbon and turn left. and go on into Lisbon and 
finish out in the war. As an intern in Lisbon,

03:29.064 --> 03:36.854
Portugal.

03:36.874 --> 03:44.023
We entertained an awful lot of people coming back 
up. Montgomery used to come in every once in a

03:46.025 --> 03:48.088
while. Oh, really? Yeah, he'd come in. Why he would 
come to us, I don't know. But he'd come to us and ask

03:53.670 --> 04:02.900
for transportation to the closest banking town, 
rather than go to the RAF. And you don't know why

04:02.920 --> 04:04.382
he'd do that? Well, see, we were still Army. We were 
Army Air Corps, US type. But he wouldn't go to the

04:09.267 --> 04:11.650
RAF. And sure enough, we had to supply him 
transportation. Let him go in and do his banking

04:16.995 --> 04:19.538
business. Maybe provide him a place to sleep so he 
didn't have to go into the RAF officer's quarters

04:20.227 --> 04:31.258
the next day back to North Africa.

04:31.278 --> 04:32.920
And what did you think of Montgomery? What, 
Montgomery? Oh, I thought he was a brilliant

04:34.301 --> 04:36.563
tactician.

04:43.410 --> 04:46.473
Eisenhower couldn't get along with everybody. He 
couldn't get along with de Gaulle either. No,

04:48.897 --> 04:51.100
absolutely. What do you think of the American 
aircraft versus the British? The what? American

04:55.064 --> 05:01.312
airplanes versus the British.

05:01.332 --> 05:13.386
Well, I don't really think

05:01.332 --> 05:13.386
you can really compare them because

05:20.690 --> 05:23.654
The British were building aircraft with their 
backs to the wall. And we were still building Rolls

05:25.557 --> 05:33.307
Royce aircraft.

05:33.327 --> 05:35.370
When the chips were down, ours came through. But 
theirs came off the line a hell of a lot quicker. And

05:39.656 --> 05:46.866
probably didn't spend as much for coffee as ours.

05:51.436 --> 06:03.053
Our particular location, where the colonel and I 
were, was known as a place called Port Reef, which

05:51.436 --> 06:03.053
is a cliff about 50 yards above the sea. And

06:05.216 --> 06:17.373
after the 17 hit the Hugo's Pen, we used to get birds 
back in there recovering rather than going on back

06:05.216 --> 06:17.373
to the bomber base. It couldn't make it back.

06:21.322 --> 06:30.717
We've actually been on a cliff and seen a B-17 
deliberately come down and hit the water just so it

06:21.322 --> 06:30.717
would bounce as high as the cliff. Really? Oh, 
yeah. No kidding? Yeah. Did they make it? Sure.

06:35.564 --> 06:37.467
Were there any that did? None that crashed into the 
cliff, but some that when they did make it up

06:38.328 --> 06:43.937
there... came on in with a gear down or something 
like that and then we could take whatever people

06:44.153 --> 06:55.385
were still alive and then push the bird aside.

06:55.405 --> 06:57.367
Now why would they do that? You mean coming in that 
way? Rather than ditch? The last thing they'd want

07:01.391 --> 07:05.496
to do is ditch out there in that cold water. 
Especially if they had wounded before. They'd

07:07.298 --> 07:11.342
have to get the wounded ashore to pick the land. 
That's where we saw our first jet, but the British

07:13.280 --> 07:17.284
wouldn't let us see it. Oh, but tell me about that. 
That part of the country has always been a testing

07:22.089 --> 07:31.399
area, and since then I have been back to that 
particular base, and it is a closed base now. But

07:31.519 --> 07:41.970
this must have been in late 43 before I moved on into 
Israel. the London area,

07:43.368 --> 08:00.890
there was a fighter that came in and it was making a 
strange noise and it started taxiing down the

07:43.368 --> 08:00.890
taxiway and somebody else says, hey look at that 
damn thing, there's no propeller on it. And two of

08:00.910 --> 08:08.700
us jumped in a jeep and tried to catch it and they 
turned in a hanger and they slammed the door on it

08:00.910 --> 08:08.700
before we could get there. But, of course, at that 
time, we didn't know what the hell it was. But it was

08:13.086 --> 08:16.671
one of their first jets. What did it look like? It 
looked like a mosquito with just chopped off, you

08:21.498 --> 08:28.187
know. It was real small, right? Yeah.

08:37.199 --> 08:46.889
When you were down at Nantes Landing, were you

08:37.199 --> 08:46.889
servicing the bombers coming back and the 
fighters? Our main mission was getting the

08:46.949 --> 09:00.562
fighters to North Africa and receiving the 
freight and passengers that were coming across

08:46.949 --> 09:00.562
the South Atlantic into our theater. Because the 
organization that we were with also had

09:07.895 --> 09:11.698
intra-theater

09:07.895 --> 09:11.698
transportation. I see. C-47s and Lockheed Lone 
Stars that the British had gotten from us and then

09:12.819 --> 09:25.731
turned back to us, and they'd fly five or six 
passengers, something like that. Not much

09:25.751 --> 09:36.501
freight, but anyway, they'd outlive their 
usefulness on coastal patrol, and they went over

09:25.751 --> 09:36.501
to them on wind lease, and then they gave back to 
them.

09:40.396 --> 09:58.440
But because we were down there and because we were 
U.S. forces, any of the U.S. troops that are planes

09:40.396 --> 09:58.440
that came in to recover, it was up to us to take care 
of them

09:40.396 --> 09:58.440
and get them back up there out there. Were you 
bombed quite a bit by the Germans? No, not down

10:00.783 --> 10:02.566
there. Why not? It's a long way from here. Oh. It's a 
good long way. He got to spend that much time

10:08.037 --> 10:11.342
bombing there. It was to his advantage to keep out 
to London or the industrial park, not down there,

10:11.362 --> 10:22.598
not to run in on a fighter base or something.

10:22.658 --> 10:24.200
No, we felt relatively comfortable there. How did 
you get along with the people? I mean, not the

10:26.704 --> 10:35.837
people, not the military, British military, but 
just the people in the communities. Well,

10:40.083 --> 10:59.543
okay we lived in the we lived off base yeah they 
didn't have quarters for you on base well the

10:40.083 --> 10:59.543
enlisted lived on on base in what we'd call a car 
paper shack now but the officers lived in

10:40.083 --> 10:59.543
different houses that had been requisitioned by 
the RAF, but they were spotted. Next door would be

11:05.192 --> 11:08.116
just a British family. But in this particular 
house, according to the size of it, just how many

11:08.717 --> 11:16.448
RAF and US would live. I lived in a room with four 
other American officers, but down the hall there

11:17.049 --> 11:24.360
was a room with three British officers. That was 
the first time that I'd ever been exposed to, you

11:29.324 --> 11:42.581
know, they call them batmen, is a service 
personnel that cleans their shoes and makes up

11:29.324 --> 11:42.581
their beds and brings them tea in the morning and so 
on. Well, they had bat women. The British officers

11:46.666 --> 11:48.328
had bat women. Well, the House would. So they'd 
come in and wake us up, hand us the tea. Really? Oh,

11:53.351 --> 11:54.913
yeah. That sounds like a pretty comfortable 
situation. Yeah, especially those guys that were

11:58.177 --> 12:02.242
single, you know. But some of them were pretty

12:02.282 --> 12:12.936
bad guys. And it was there that you made major? No, I 
went through that as a captain. I made pager when I

12:19.342 --> 12:25.230
moved into the London area.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.792
And I made pager one November 44. Oh, okay. Well, 
first, you went from second to first to captain. A

12:32.859 --> 12:34.241
year, just every year. A year, every year. How can 
you account for that? That's tremendous.

12:43.894 --> 12:44.314
I guess. I mean, you know, like...

12:49.109 --> 12:50.250
No way of being humble. I just say that's back to the 
goals that I had set. I was going to be a military man

12:55.114 --> 12:58.718
in the period. That was my forte. And like I said 
earlier, I could see contemporaries that just

13:01.340 --> 13:07.445
didn't make it that fast. You've got to put it 
somewhere. Because it wasn't all under the same

13:12.510 --> 13:18.255
people.

13:21.172 --> 13:33.407
I don't think I've ever had two promotions done on 
the same person.

13:33.427 --> 13:35.870
What were the thoughts on the German Luftwaffe?

13:39.314 --> 13:45.861
Do you think it was a formidable air force?

13:45.882 --> 13:46.302
Yes.

13:53.538 --> 14:21.300
I, my analysis or evaluation of the whole thing is 
just that

13:53.538 --> 14:21.300
discipline, the installation of discipline is 
more difficult at the top level than it is with the

13:53.538 --> 14:21.300
truth. You can make troops realize the importance 
of discipline, principally for their own safety

14:23.542 --> 14:33.372
and welfare. But you try to do that at the top, and 
you're going to get nothing except disbelievers.

14:41.760 --> 14:47.486
And this is where the whole thing fell apart. There 
was not discipline at the time. I'm not talking

14:49.868 --> 14:51.810
about it in the book.

14:55.385 --> 15:03.877
when the Luftwaffe no longer controlled the 
Luftwaffe, it began to just completely fall

14:55.385 --> 15:03.877
apart. And when the decision was made to put so much 
emphasis into the B-1 and the B-2 and less into the

15:03.897 --> 15:20.241
Luftwaffe, he lost one of the biggest weapons the 
world's ever known. Would you like something to

15:20.261 --> 15:22.064
drink? Let's see if we can

15:28.021 --> 15:34.691
Okay, so your duties changed in 1944 when you went 
to Wanda. Is that correct? Yeah, I became what was

15:36.053 --> 15:45.306
known as an air inspector. It's a fancy name for 
inspector general. Oh, I see. But the Air Force or

15:49.433 --> 15:55.902
Air Corps had to be different from its Army 
sisters. They called them air inspectors. And we

15:58.562 --> 16:10.937
were then, to give you an idea, we were then a group 
that had been formed in the theater. It was not

16:12.199 --> 16:14.161
formed in the United States. Everything was put 
together over there. It was equipped over there.

16:17.245 --> 16:25.095
And we had

16:17.245 --> 16:25.095
four transport squadrons We had two fairing 
squadrons.

16:33.414 --> 16:36.619
We had a quartermaster truck company. And we were 
scattered all over the United Kingdom. The

16:41.386 --> 16:44.251
transport squadrons, they speak for themselves. 
They just moved stuff within the theater. The

16:48.798 --> 16:50.661
fairing squadrons actually...

16:53.577 --> 17:00.187
moved the replacement aircraft from the depot up 
to the combat unit. If a unit lost a bomber,

17:00.207 --> 17:13.408
our taxi aircraft, which was usually a gutted B-17 
or B-24, would take crews over to the depot They'd

17:14.924 --> 17:20.110
give them one and say, OK, take it to the building 
hall or wherever it was going. And they'd deliver

17:20.130 --> 17:21.632
the aircraft. And then the taxi would come by later 
and pick them up. Well, there was a time in the war

17:25.657 --> 17:41.395
when

17:25.657 --> 17:41.395
we just lost a hell of a lot of crews.

17:42.156 --> 17:42.737
Why? It would beat the daylights out of them for 
about six months. And we were losing them. And we

17:51.447 --> 18:08.067
had orders from Spots headquarters that the taxi 
aircraft would not pick our boys up until early the

17:51.447 --> 18:08.067
next morning and then take them to the depot and let 
them make a run. And our boys didn't even go back to

18:08.808 --> 18:11.391
their own base. And

18:11.911 --> 18:33.078
what was happening was they would go and fill the 
empty chairs in the dining halls and drink at the

18:11.911 --> 18:33.078
bars at night, you know, and keep the places just 
from looking like they had just lost everything.

18:33.498 --> 18:36.282
And so the same thing happened to My crew and me, as 
we traveled around, the old man said, okay, if

18:37.190 --> 18:45.818
Tui's doing it to the pilots, you do the same thing. 
Anytime you've got to move, you move in the morning

18:45.858 --> 18:53.265
and be sure that you all stay put at night. And 
again, our location, we were in Ireland, back at

18:53.285 --> 19:04.615
that place that I started in Scotland, Land's End, 
about six or eight places in England. And we just

19:05.067 --> 19:10.654
moved from place to place on IG inspections.

19:15.539 --> 19:17.962
All I can say about it, it's a job. It certainly 
broadens you.

19:23.629 --> 19:28.755
Exactly what were you searching for during the 
inspections? Any type of

19:28.775 --> 19:34.281
misappropriation. misalignment or infraction 
of a major rule that would hurt the operation or

19:34.582 --> 19:45.395
something like that. To wit. Hurt the operation of 
the Air Force or certain airplanes? Both. And to

19:52.584 --> 19:54.165
wit. The old man called me in one day and he says, 
over at so-and-so. And that was where we were

20:04.771 --> 20:13.323
loading jerrycans with gasoline, and they were 
flying them to the continent to pack them. And

20:13.343 --> 20:16.347
these birds would just go back and forth. They'd 
come in and land, and they'd taxi the bird right up

20:16.428 --> 20:27.623
to a pile of jerrycans, and we'd have a crew just put 
the jerrycans in the aircraft, and off they'd go

20:16.428 --> 20:27.623
again. He said, okay, you get out there and find out 
what's going on. He said, I've got ten suits of

20:31.028 --> 20:33.732
bastardy, And I've got 12 A walls out there. Get out 
there and find out what's going on. Off the base,

20:40.272 --> 20:42.894
though. Off the base, you had all these problems. 
Yeah, out at this particular base where this was

20:45.476 --> 20:48.319
going on. So I get out there and... Where was the 
base, do you remember? It was a base in England.

20:57.087 --> 21:00.010
Down near Chevelston.

21:02.072 --> 21:03.533
I get out and I said... Well, your first problem is 
you don't have a commander out here. And he says,

21:08.598 --> 21:09.800
where's Crowley? And I said, he's soused in the 
officer's club, and he's been in there three days.

21:14.385 --> 21:21.114
And I understand from the captain out here that 
it's been like that for about two or three weeks.

21:22.876 --> 21:25.179
I've had a run-in with this Major Crowley before. I 
was still a captain. I've had a run-in with him

21:26.821 --> 21:29.164
before. And he says, OK, you stay there and take 
command. And I'll get you relieved as soon as I can

21:34.748 --> 21:39.552
find somebody else to come in there. I said, well,

21:39.572 --> 21:47.179
Colonel, I said, I can't take command, but I'll 
stay here and run it. He said, why can't you? And I

21:49.121 --> 21:52.984
said, it's listed on our chart as a flying job. I'm 
not rated. He says, when he called a captain's

21:54.705 --> 21:58.389
name, he said, oh, they're in ops. Isn't he rated? I 
said, yeah. He says, OK. You tell him that he's in

21:59.770 --> 22:04.654
command, but stay in operations And you get that 
damn gasoline thing running again. Well, the

22:09.054 --> 22:13.822
sergeant and I had each taken out with just a 
musette bag, you know, just a canvas bag. I stayed

22:14.002 --> 22:18.429
there two weeks living out of that canvas bag until 
he got another major. He got a major down there. He

22:19.932 --> 22:23.457
relieved this guy and finally sent him on back to 
the States. But it was a... just a round-the-clock

22:27.685 --> 22:42.792
operation because the logistics department who 
was stretching his line was such that he couldn't

22:27.685 --> 22:42.792
bring it up from his rear and we had to always just 
meet him as he was making his dash across the

22:27.685 --> 22:42.792
country. So he'd make his dash and he'd tell you 
what airstrip that he wants your planes at at a

22:42.812 --> 22:50.706
certain time. With how much oil or as much gas as you 
could get to them? The tank ran on the same fuel that

22:55.235 --> 22:57.759
our birds ran on. Oh, okay. And so you'd meet them in 
a certain place at a certain time. That's right.

23:04.389 --> 23:06.152
And you'd just keep up with them all the time. Was it 
easy or hard to work with? Who, me? Yeah.

23:11.621 --> 23:13.523
Fortunately, I didn't have to communicate with 
them. All I had to do was get the damn birds loaded

23:13.544 --> 23:18.972
and ready for the ops to say, A-40 or C-69 or 
wherever they were headed. Were a lot of your

23:24.007 --> 23:26.571
airplanes shot down? No.

23:33.400 --> 23:46.939
I guess the reason that they weren't is our

23:33.400 --> 23:46.939
old man was a pretty

23:33.400 --> 23:46.939
outspoken guy and he had his way. Les Arnold And 
that doesn't mean anything to you, but Les was the

23:48.871 --> 23:58.662
vice president of Eastern Airlines when he went 
back on active duty for World War II. But he was also

23:59.363 --> 24:06.831
one of the crew that made the first 
round-the-world flight in the Douglas aircraft.

24:06.911 --> 24:08.312
You know, the open cockpit job? He was one of those 
guys. And he just told Fox, don't send me the C-46s.

24:16.161 --> 24:17.022
I won't fly them. Well, the C-46 carried a hell of a 
lot more weight than the C-47. But unfortunately,

24:23.784 --> 24:32.212
all of its hydraulics were in a very critical area 
right down the belly underneath. And a guy with a

24:32.912 --> 24:35.235
rifle could put the damn thing out. And we proved it 
by the first one that came over there. And he just

24:40.320 --> 24:41.421
turned them down. And so what we were really using 
to carry the cans back and forth were ripped out

24:44.322 --> 24:55.939
B-17s and B-24s, which had a, boy, they'd fly on a 
prairie. Yeah. So you'd use bombers then for

24:58.223 --> 25:01.267
transports. That's right.

25:04.472 --> 25:06.014
Just clean out all the innards. Cleaned out 
everything. But they were birds that had gone back

25:08.358 --> 25:13.806
to the depot, and the depot was a, you know, It'd be 
more economic, or rather than rebuild it back to

25:15.490 --> 25:22.200
the mom state, let's use them for this. We didn't 
have the authority to rip them out, but we didn't

25:23.082 --> 25:29.411
have any trouble with it that far. But Les was 
fantastic.

25:37.123 --> 25:42.291
He was of that age group and that and had the rapport 
with the the top air force people because of his

25:43.992 --> 26:12.970
position with eastern and even though he was just a 
colonel and he you know he just talked to him like

25:43.992 --> 26:12.970
you can't do that to it you know i've heard him on the 
phone where any other colonel would probably been

25:43.992 --> 26:12.970
crucified you know but there were a number of 
people like that that were brought back into the

25:43.992 --> 26:12.970
war see rickenbacker let him leave eastern 
Rickenbacker was then president of Eastern. He

26:15.606 --> 26:25.077
let him leave Eastern just to come back in during 
the war, because they needed people

26:15.606 --> 26:25.077
like that. Were there any other problems that you 
were having as far as Air Inspector? Any other

26:29.743 --> 26:31.866
major problems? Well, the next problem I had was a 
personal problem. It took

26:34.329 --> 26:42.619
me out of duty for a while.

26:45.113 --> 27:04.675
developed some symptoms that they couldn't 
determine what the hell was the matter with me and I

26:45.113 --> 27:04.675
consented to an exploratory and they removed 14 
inches of my small intestines and gave me a choice

27:05.212 --> 27:10.660
as to whether I'd come home or go back to duty, and I 
went back to duty. Didn't make the little gal

27:11.541 --> 27:15.427
downstairs happy, but still.

27:16.949 --> 27:26.743
Ain't no sense in going back and getting started 
somewhere else, because it's been the same thing

27:16.949 --> 27:26.743
all over, because everybody's coming home for 30 
days, and then, whop, right back over. So I just

27:26.763 --> 27:31.270
said, well, let's go.

27:34.000 --> 27:46.816
As soon as I came out of the hospital, I went right 
back to my same outfit because personnel people

27:34.000 --> 27:46.816
had the way paved through the depot that I wasn't 
about to go to another outfit. I was going right

27:46.836 --> 27:53.504
back to the same outfit.

27:55.006 --> 27:59.771
They made me a station agent. I was promoted to 
major. Les' headquarters was at a great big white

28:04.122 --> 28:14.919
mansion which was about two miles off of the RAF 
base that we kept all our aircraft at.

28:21.590 --> 28:25.616
This was at a base called RAF Heston. RAF Heston is 
now in the approach zone of Heathrow, which is the

28:30.397 --> 28:33.382
big airport in London. So it has been swallowed up 
by the base. But that's where it was. And that put it

28:39.992 --> 28:45.640
right straight in Buzz Bomb Alley. And

28:45.660 --> 28:52.911
that's where we, though we didn't suffer any death 
casualties we did suffer injuries and a lot of

28:53.701 --> 29:20.755
physical damage at the base and we were well pretty 
fortunate that Les Arnold's headquarters was not

28:53.701 --> 29:20.755
on the base it was back off though it could have been 
hit it had its own communication system

28:53.701 --> 29:20.755
and everything but I went by one thing that that was 
really interesting and to show you that no matter

29:21.460 --> 29:29.052
who you are, you can always do something 
different. The night before D-Day,

29:30.434 --> 29:47.362
we had, and

29:30.434 --> 29:47.362
of course this was even before this jerrycan 
thing, the fly in the gasoline. Oh, absolutely.

29:51.127 --> 29:55.593
Yeah,

29:51.127 --> 29:55.593
somewhere in there. But the night before, the U.S. 
Air Corps changed the symbols on all of its

29:56.093 --> 30:05.245
airplanes. I don't know whether you were aware of 
that or not, but we used to have just a star and a

30:05.846 --> 30:11.834
circle. And the night before,

30:15.578 --> 30:22.150
put the star with the big rectangle box out to each 
side. Why was that? Because there were so many of

30:24.695 --> 30:37.418
our birds down in Europe and being used by Jerry 
that they wanted a definite identity of what was

30:24.695 --> 30:37.418
ours and what wasn't ours. And all over the United 
Kingdom, All the bomber bases, the fighter bases,

30:41.043 --> 30:49.756
the transport bases, every aircraft we had that 
night had the new symbol put on them. That took

30:49.776 --> 30:53.021
every enlisted man and every officer. And boy, all 
we did all night long was just paint those new

30:53.041 --> 30:57.928
symbols on the birds. And of course, it paid off. 
They tried to put some into our formations over the

31:02.069 --> 31:05.816
beaches and things like that. In other words, 
their symbol could be changed, or our old symbol

31:06.316 --> 31:12.327
could be changed too easily to their symbol? No, 
they were flying ours. They were flying our

31:14.611 --> 31:16.614
symbol. They were flying our birds as though they 
were peaceful, and then bombing us or strafing us.

31:23.787 --> 31:24.448
I see, I see. So they'd get a hold of ours that went 
down, repair them, and then fly ours. That's

31:30.825 --> 31:31.265
right. I see. They'd fly them across North 
Scotland or down in the mid or something like that.

31:39.495 --> 31:39.935
Anywhere. And they'd look like ours. That's 
right. So did we have a big problem with that? We had

31:44.400 --> 31:45.662
a big problem with that. Well, there was enough of 
it that... Somebody in Eisenhower's staff said,

31:48.121 --> 31:51.084
we want them changed. We changed them so that when 
we hit the beaches, we'll know which are ours.

31:57.229 --> 32:04.135
We'll fire on all the old ones and let the new ones 
come on through.

32:06.057 --> 32:13.303
So the night before, all over the United Kingdom, 
we were changing that outside symbol. And on

32:13.323 --> 32:17.807
D-Day, were you involved in any way? On D-Day, just 
there at the base of sending out the transports and

32:17.905 --> 32:26.959
sending people down into the area where the troops 
were going from. But I did not go into the beach or

32:26.979 --> 32:31.145
anything. I didn't go into Cherbourg until, I went 
into Cherbourg about three days after Cherbourg

32:31.165 --> 32:39.738
was taken. And we established our first point 
there of freight being moved by our aircraft in the

32:46.475 --> 32:49.961
Cherbourg. And then the next point that I moved 
into was into Paris. But at Cherbourg it was

32:56.513 --> 33:01.902
basically move in as much military supplies as 
fast as possible. Flying the essentials.

33:05.935 --> 33:08.357
Everything else still came in by boat and by 
lighter. But the essentials were flown in.

33:11.841 --> 33:15.884
Medical supplies, ammunition, stuff like that? 
No, ammunition. We didn't fly anything. What did

33:19.788 --> 33:22.150
you fly in? Parts. Mechanical parts. And were you 
flying the old bombers or were you flying

33:25.513 --> 33:28.715
anything? Anything that we had. Most of, by that 
time, the we were pretty well equipped with C-47.

33:34.972 --> 33:37.796
And what was your job, Sherbert? I went in and 
established the layout of the camp and stayed in

33:37.816 --> 33:44.926
there until they got the things set up, and then I 
came on back. And then I went in and did the same

33:44.946 --> 33:48.170
thing. Somebody else was in charge of that. And 
then I did the same thing, and when they liberated

33:49.832 --> 33:56.121
Paris, I went in I made the assessment on what we had 
to do to Le Bourget. Le Bourget is where Lindbergh

34:00.002 --> 34:05.310
landed and had just been bombed to hell. They told 
us that we were going to have to operate out of Le

34:05.650 --> 34:18.970
Bourget because the inner theater aircraft, the 
big transports, were going to work from Orly to the

34:05.650 --> 34:18.970
other airports.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.268
Another officer now went in and made the 
assessment. What's the difference now? I'm not

34:23.309 --> 34:24.611
quite clear on that. What do you mean the other 
aircraft were going to... The inter-theater from

34:27.995 --> 34:32.680
Paris back to the United States. Oh, okay. The big, 
which is now MAC. We were strictly theater. Okay,

34:40.389 --> 34:42.672
okay. And they, by the time we knew that we... 
That's not a good statement. I was going to say, by

34:50.070 --> 34:54.938
the time we knew we had Paris, we didn't know that 
for quite a while. But anyway, the plan was that we

34:56.701 --> 35:03.492
would start bypassing the United Kingdom. You 
want to light on it? No. Oh, no. But we'd bypass the

35:07.097 --> 35:10.603
United Kingdom so you can start working straight 
to the continent. Uh-huh. And so they got orally.

35:14.587 --> 35:16.470
And we got one on the other side of town. OK, so any 
Washington or New York to Paris, then they go

35:16.510 --> 35:21.297
straight into Orland. Into Orland. OK. And the big 
general hospital was set right out about three

35:22.179 --> 35:31.753
miles from Orland, so that it could be very back to 
the state. But working strictly in Tron Theater,

35:32.294 --> 35:37.281
we got the other side of town. And the conditions 
there were all bombs. Oh, yeah. fact is how did the

35:43.527 --> 36:07.543
germans do this before they allowed to no no we did 
it we did it and then had to go in and sometimes we're

35:43.527 --> 36:07.543
foolish but then we had to go in and bulldoze it over 
and or just ignore part of their buttons but i went

35:43.527 --> 36:07.543
to an air show there and but your job was to clean it 
up right my job was to go and make the assessment as

35:43.527 --> 36:07.543
to what we would have to do to use Leborger. You 
know, and how much engineering effort we had to get

36:10.340 --> 36:19.710
to get the rubble out of the way, and how much runway 
we'd have to have repaired, and so on. Well, they

36:19.730 --> 36:21.712
carried part. We did. I mean, we went in. Hell, we 
had to get in. You know, all it was was not whether,

36:24.715 --> 36:29.459
can you use this? What's the effort to use it? 
Because it being... communication center. There

36:37.210 --> 36:43.118
was no way that we could operate in the theater 
unless we were in there. Now our headquarters by

36:43.138 --> 37:01.122
that time we had grown from the 27th Air Transport 
Group had been joined with the 31st and it was now

36:43.138 --> 37:01.122
the 302nd Transport Wing. So that made it about 
twice the size, not completely, but about twice

37:05.962 --> 37:11.627
the size that we had before then. Because the 31st 
came up from the southern, from the belly through

37:11.667 --> 37:18.273
Italy and coming up that way. And then they joined 
them together. And the 302nd Transport Wing

37:20.655 --> 37:33.927
headquarters was located in downtown Paris after 
we had moved into Le Bourget and they had moved on up

37:20.655 --> 37:33.927
the country. But I said a while ago, after we had 
felt that we had Paris, when the general told the

37:35.712 --> 38:02.783
Germans nuts at Bastogne, had Bastogne fallen, 
then everybody that was at Compiègne would have

37:35.712 --> 38:02.783
moved to Paris. And everybody that was in Paris 
would have either moved south in France or back to

38:03.505 --> 38:11.573
the United Kingdom. And we were already packed to 
go back to the United Kingdom. This was our order,

38:14.957 --> 38:17.139
you know. Had the dominoes started falling, 
because... You were going to make a strategic

38:18.320 --> 38:23.246
retreat. Well, we had to make room for everybody 
else. But fortunately, it didn't come about. And

38:30.433 --> 38:33.276
Compiègne held, which was the advance... 
headquarters and Paris was the logistical

38:33.779 --> 38:41.146
support headquarters. But that was not a very 
happy Christmas because a number of us knew what

38:41.246 --> 38:49.875
was about to happen. Let's get back to Paris now. 
You went in there and when was this? About

38:53.639 --> 38:54.820
September of 1944? October? Right after it was 
liberated? Yes. Okay. And at that time I was the

39:03.732 --> 39:12.566
director of personnel of the 300 second transport 
wing, as well as the agent general of the wing. And

39:12.586 --> 39:23.643
to give you an idea, that's 1,000 officers, 5,000 
enlisted, and 1,500 civilians. But again,

39:23.663 --> 39:28.390
remember that spread, United Kingdom, France, 
all the way down to southern France. We didn't have

39:31.235 --> 39:37.324
anybody in Italy, but we were all through France 
and all through the United Kingdom.

39:40.989 --> 39:56.352
It was a table of organization that was crazy when 
it was based, the way administration can get

39:40.989 --> 39:56.352
screwed up, it was based on a table of organization 
equipment that was put together for the HUP in

39:57.074 --> 40:00.417
India. And TO had six officers authorized, and we 
had 36 officers.

40:12.609 --> 40:20.256
Any time you do that, all you do is you rob 30 
authorizations from your subordinates. And it

40:20.276 --> 40:23.419
makes promotions pretty damn rough. I was sitting 
there as a major in the lieutenant colonel's slot.

40:26.355 --> 40:29.999
What a way in the world to get promoted. So 
everything is eaten up, you know. Then they

40:32.381 --> 40:36.546
started holding us to authorization. Now, can you 
tell me about the conditions in Paris? You must

40:39.850 --> 40:41.271
have gone into Paris. And about the people, how 
they treated you.

40:47.998 --> 40:52.123
Well,

40:47.998 --> 40:52.123
the Parisians There are French people and there 
are Parisians.

41:03.940 --> 41:16.157
The Frenchman, individually, is one of the nicest 
guys that I think you'll ever want to know.

41:16.177 --> 41:19.782
Collectively, they're a bunch of milk hounds. 
They get, we were talking about spirit and emotion

41:19.802 --> 41:23.427
earlier. They get all wrapped up and they're just 
too damn easy to get let off on the wrong track or

41:23.643 --> 41:34.073
something like that. We had no problems with them 
because, again, we were

41:34.093 --> 41:53.633
the big liberators and a lot of them knew it even 
though we sat back and a number of units like us were

41:34.093 --> 41:53.633
in there, no big U.S. unit with great big generals 
came in until after De Gaulle did. De Gaulle made

42:00.921 --> 42:07.589
the sweep into Paris and took all of the glory and 
everything. Even though we had units already in

42:08.710 --> 42:10.412
there. They didn't put generals in to make parades 
and claim the victory. They let De Gaulle come in.

42:17.920 --> 42:22.485
But the Frenchmen knew who were in there. Because 
At that time, de Gaulle still didn't have France

42:23.279 --> 42:28.526
completely under his wings. He was still a little

42:28.666 --> 42:44.908
questionable.

42:47.311 --> 42:49.354
We had some misgivings with some of their military 
are owning it. We lived in a fabulous, the officers

42:55.411 --> 43:07.264
lived in a fabulous big house out on the edge of the 
border balloon, which is the fashionable part of

42:55.411 --> 43:07.264
Paris. And directly across the street from the 
Gauls residence. And every once in a while,

43:20.080 --> 43:48.737
security would get a little concerned about our 
conduct or what was going on and come over and try to

43:20.080 --> 43:48.737
quiet us down or something like that and so our 
provost marshal was always having to remind them

43:20.080 --> 43:48.737
that when they crossed the threshold they were in 
u.s territory not in france you know and he spoke

43:20.080 --> 43:48.737
pretty good french and he managed to communicate 
with him i guess the worst time that we ever had with

43:20.080 --> 43:48.737
him was We got up on top of our building and started 
cutting off the submachine gun and the .45s

43:50.303 --> 43:57.590
because we didn't have any firecrackers. That 
really put a security force into activity, but we

43:57.630 --> 44:05.138
lived through it. So would you consider then that 
the relations between the French and the American

44:05.158 --> 44:14.767
soldiers, as far as you knew, were rather 
strained? No. Friendly? Oh, they were friendly,

44:18.070 --> 44:19.652
sure. We're just in an isolated situation here 
where if I was guarding the galleys, it would scare

44:20.223 --> 44:25.951
the hell out of me, too. Sure. Absolutely.

44:30.777 --> 44:41.151
This same lieutenant

44:30.777 --> 44:41.151
named Carter from Boston, Massachusetts, he was a 
subordinate of mine and was a provost marshal. And

44:41.171 --> 44:46.939
he was out one day and he found a marshaling yard 
that had a huge supply of coal. And it was the size of

44:52.149 --> 45:00.898
coal that you would use in a boiler, like on a 
locomotive or even in a heating plant. And he came

45:00.918 --> 45:02.980
back and reported it to me. And I immediately told 
the old man about it. And he called the chief of

45:05.663 --> 45:07.865
staff in. And the chief of staff was Colonel Henry 
Bevelle. And he said, OK, Henry. you'll take half

45:16.484 --> 45:26.418
of the officers and half the enlisted men 
tomorrow, and Hub, you'll take the other half the

45:16.484 --> 45:26.418
next day, and we're going to move that coat. And so 
Henry went out with his half, and I went out the next

45:28.140 --> 45:38.475
day with my half, and then when Henry went back out 
the next day, it was run by military police. So we

45:39.215 --> 45:41.839
only got two days haul of coal out of there. But we 
had officers and men hauling coal like they came

45:41.899 --> 45:49.972
out of West Virginia because coal was in real short 
supply. And just what we got kicked to our supply.

45:55.540 --> 45:58.986
Saw us through the winter comfortably. Oh, man. 
And the enlisted men too. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then

46:05.641 --> 46:08.364
the French military police went on? Oh, the U.S. 
military police. Oh, the U.S. military police.

46:12.028 --> 46:14.732
But they didn't make you bring back the... No, no, 
they didn't know. They didn't know. They might

46:17.094 --> 46:19.938
have known, but there was no way they were going to 
make us bring it back.

46:22.801 --> 46:26.385
All they were doing was just protecting it for the 
supply people then. We didn't figure the supply

46:26.425 --> 46:33.213
people had any more title to it than we did. It was a 
bombed-out railroad yard, but... Well,

46:37.754 --> 46:58.294
anyway, it was from that headquarters that

46:37.754 --> 46:58.294
Colonel Angel, that we had referred to earlier, 
had been the administrative assistant to the

46:37.754 --> 46:58.294
president at A&M.
