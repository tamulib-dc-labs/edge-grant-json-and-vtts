WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:14.496
Mike Winand that was on the microphone and 
describing how they were going to pass a certain

00:02.242 --> 00:14.496
certain law to make such and such legal and this and 
that and it was being broadcast to spectators and

00:02.242 --> 00:14.496
everybody. That was fun and of course Mardi Gras if 
you as an RV is an interesting it's the wildest time

00:15.016 --> 00:41.817
it's it's not carnival and all that mess and 
staying on aircraft carrier but it was the Mardi

00:15.016 --> 00:41.817
Gras Day parade and fighting the drunks in New 
Orleans and it was the physical hand-to-hand

00:15.016 --> 00:41.817
combat of getting through the streets of New 
Orleans we had one drunk that fell into our ranks

00:15.016 --> 00:41.817
hit slid off one guy turned around and we were told 
to hit them and get them out of our ranks And I didn't

00:42.235 --> 00:52.175
know what else to do, and this guy was kind of 
staggering and swinging at another guy, and so I

00:42.235 --> 00:52.175
hit him over the head with my rifle, and he just fell 
to the ground, and our platoon just marched right

00:42.235 --> 00:52.175
over him. And I guess he's still there. I don't know 
what happened to him. Now, how did you all get to

00:55.642 --> 00:59.129
Austin and to New Orleans? Personal car. You just 
got there, however. Show up, be there, here's

01:01.774 --> 01:04.159
where we are. And you were expected to pay the, you, 
the RVs were to pay the car expense. Absolutely.

01:09.556 --> 01:10.157
You're on your own. Where did you spend the night? 
We stayed on the aircraft carrier Lexington,

01:11.980 --> 01:15.987
which was docked at Bienville Street Wharf. And we 
got there, and this is where they put the Citadel

01:16.007 --> 01:21.515
and VPI and all these little groups. We got to look, 
and they had all this huge carrier bay on the first

01:26.313 --> 01:29.959
level with all these cots and the lights are on 24 
hours. Wait a minute, this isn't a good deal. So we

01:32.463 --> 01:43.562
poked around the ship until we found the end of the 
ship where the anchor comes out was a small room

01:32.463 --> 01:43.562
that would accommodate probably 40 or 50 cots and a 
lot quieter and dark. And outside of losing one kid

01:44.200 --> 01:50.668
from the Citadel that fell out the anchor hole when 
he was throwing up, that was our place. And so we had

01:50.969 --> 01:55.034
our own place, and we found a separate head that we 
could shower and bathe in. Aggies tend to just find

01:56.196 --> 02:00.121
things and make them work, and it worked a whole lot 
better. What did you and your buddies think about

02:00.642 --> 02:06.129
those Citadel and VMI? Oh, we visited with them, 
and there's always a lot of competition,

02:06.209 --> 02:13.178
whatever. We all go through a lot of the same 
things. Our impression was A&M's still a better

02:16.813 --> 02:19.595
place. We got more out of it. I spent a week with the 
Student Council on Urban Affairs or whatever, the

02:22.378 --> 02:31.547
SCONA counterpart at the Air Force Academy. And 
I'd had a cousin that was wing commander at the Air

02:31.947 --> 02:35.510
Force Academy in 69. And he'd spent a week with me at 
A&M. And he said, there's no comparison. What you

02:40.035 --> 02:43.418
have at A&M, we lost 20 years ago. You know, the 
hazing and things, the good bull at A&M, this

02:44.326 --> 02:48.461
didn't happen in service academies. They don't 
anymore because under the eye of Congress and any

02:52.747 --> 02:55.790
complaint to somebody's mommy, and you've got a 
congressional investigation.

02:58.934 --> 03:09.726
Meanwhile, back in the vet school, what were some 
very meaningful experiences you now realize in

02:58.934 --> 03:09.726
those three years as a vet student? Three full 
years. A lot of intense academics, going to school

03:11.428 --> 03:18.957
with people that all are pretty well focused on 
what they want to do. And, of course, a lot of them

03:18.937 --> 03:23.423
married, some with kids. This was a new experience 
for me. And developing, again, another set of

03:24.965 --> 03:33.176
wonderful friendships that continue to this day, 
like Pete and Sue Baden and others.

03:35.579 --> 03:44.691
You start, you find out, especially when you get 
into your clinical rotations, that a number of the

03:35.579 --> 03:44.691
veterinarians there have never been in private 
practice. Not that private practice is

03:45.211 --> 03:48.415
everything, but that's the majority of students 
are going to go. And so you tend to couch a lot of what

03:48.515 --> 03:56.585
you learn with, well, that may or may not be the way 
it really is on the outside.

04:00.870 --> 04:12.163
Most of the classes were probably the hardest 
class was for our class in that nine trimesters was

04:00.870 --> 04:12.163
Dr. Worsig's toxicology class. And we had two 
classmates that were right on the brink of

04:12.987 --> 04:18.878
failing. And so we were kind of, really up in arms 
about that as any class would be. And there were a

04:24.624 --> 04:28.629
lot of complaints to the dean and back and forth and 
a lot of low grades. And it was a real tense time. And

04:31.993 --> 04:38.460
we showed up for the class that it was all looks like 
everything was going to come down. And Dr. Worsig

04:39.081 --> 04:47.230
gets behind the podium and bends down and 
disappears for a minute and comes back up with a

04:39.081 --> 04:47.230
catcher's mask and a chest protector on and he said 
okay you sons of bitches I'm ready for you and that

04:47.311 --> 05:06.687
kind of broke the ice because after that we 
realized he is human and after that we were okay and

04:47.311 --> 05:06.687
the guys didn't fail and we all got out of there and 
everything was fine but that was uh it took some

04:47.311 --> 05:06.687
guts on his part to do that and did uh Did those 
students that were in danger before that time, did

05:07.578 --> 05:12.690
they deserve to pass? Probably not. And those two 
that had trouble, neither one of them were

05:14.634 --> 05:19.224
practicing today. No, so I can now catch that with 
nearly 27 years of experience. Clinically, they

05:25.499 --> 05:28.426
just weren't cut out for practicing. Were there 
any routines in the preparation years in vet

05:28.506 --> 05:38.850
school, were there any routines that at that time 
you all thought might be a little bit out of date?

05:40.366 --> 05:41.608
No, I'm not. We didn't have a lot to gauge it by. Been 
a huge technology boost in our profession as there

05:44.132 --> 05:50.121
is in all the health professions. I think a few 
things we felt there were other procedures we were

05:51.544 --> 05:59.356
aware of that weren't being performed at the vet 
school at the time, especially in large animal

05:51.544 --> 05:59.356
medicine. At that time, they had a much older large 
animal clinical staff that have since all gone on

05:59.817 --> 06:07.048
and Many have passed away. Many of them came to the 
school because of the drought of the 50s. And that

06:13.821 --> 06:16.705
teaching was antiquated and behind. And we had no 
problems with the small animal sector, but some

06:17.165 --> 06:24.434
armed open conflict with some of the large animal 
clinicians. But that was probably the only place.

06:26.817 --> 06:29.501
Everything else, we didn't have anything to 
compare it to. Did you have anyone that you

06:29.521 --> 06:35.128
gradually developed a relationship with to be a 
kind of an advisor? Probably a couple people that I

06:37.117 --> 06:47.591
could visit with, but again, since I was going into 
the Air Force, I was so shot in the rear with

06:37.117 --> 06:47.591
importance that I didn't spend a lot of time being 
mentored. We were really, this is one of the evils

06:48.132 --> 06:58.485
of the trimester system, it was too intense and too 
fast, and that's why they quit it, because there

06:48.132 --> 06:58.485
was a lot of burnout on both sides of the fence. What 
did you think you were gonna do after the Air Force?

07:03.408 --> 07:18.595
I thought, you know, there was always private 
practice, but didn't know, and I thought at one

07:03.408 --> 07:18.595
time I might be interested in a zoo or an exotic type 
practice working for one of the major zoological

07:03.408 --> 07:18.595
gardens, something like that. That was before I 
graduated, after I'm in the service for a while. In

07:23.424 --> 07:28.032
fact, I even had a job with the United Nations if I 
decided to stay in North Africa. realizing you

07:28.130 --> 07:38.882
want to do that and i really got interested in 
making a living in very medicine got interested in

07:28.130 --> 07:38.882
common product clinical practice the As far as you 
knew, what was your Air Force duty going to be? As

07:44.571 --> 07:46.333
far as you knew before you got into it. I knew 
because I knew where I was going to go, say, six

07:46.353 --> 07:49.657
months before. I'd been told if I got an early 
commissioning program, Archie Flowers said, no

07:49.677 --> 07:57.947
problem, you'll get your choice of assignments 
because you're signing up three years early. And I

07:58.748 --> 07:59.549
said, great. I want to go to Europe. And they said, 
gee, sorry, but there's nothing open in Europe.

08:04.855 --> 08:07.198
But if you volunteer to go to Southeast Asia, then 
You know, you can get your choice in a year.

08:13.045 --> 08:13.826
But y'all promised. Well, it doesn't work quite 
that way. So I end up volunteering, and I go to

08:15.910 --> 08:18.955
Southeast Asia. And then after I'm there, the same 
thing. Well, yeah, but there's nothing open.

08:23.864 --> 08:30.216
Well, I got on a true red phone in the SAC, Advanced 
Echelon Targeting Headquarters, down in the

08:23.864 --> 08:30.216
bunker. at NKP Thailand and called and talked to a 
veterinarian at a Navy base in North Africa named

08:30.837 --> 08:39.271
Jim Jordan, a Kansas State graduate. And he said, 
this is the greatest place in the world. If you like

08:41.554 --> 08:47.003
to travel, if you like the outdoors, if you want to 
see the world, the Navy doesn't know what we do.

08:47.404 --> 08:49.487
Come on over. A&M prepared me tremendously well to 
deal with the U.S. military. It was like taking

08:55.894 --> 08:57.656
candy from a baby. And we, three years in the 
service, I averaged traveling over 90 days a year

08:58.398 --> 09:04.506
around the world. All right. Were you really 
working in public health? No. I was doing, unlike

09:10.034 --> 09:16.062
most veterinarians, I did not have hardly any 
public health responsibility. I did clinical

09:16.142 --> 09:17.223
practice. So I did guard dogs. ran a pet clinic in 
Morocco, guard dogs both in Southeast Asia and

09:19.437 --> 09:34.698
Morocco, Southeast Asia, medical civic action, 
working with pigs and people and water buffalos in

09:19.437 --> 09:34.698
the villages, doing a lot of human medicine, both 
on GIs and Orientals, and wonderful training. No

09:35.639 --> 09:37.201
veterinarians, nobody to mentor me. I was by 
myself, and I delivered some babies. Never done it

09:41.127 --> 09:42.168
before. They say, you American doctor. I said, 
wrong kind of doctor. Didn't care. So I got a

09:46.252 --> 09:49.482
baptism of fire of a different kind. It was very 
maturing. Let's see. Let's come back to the

09:53.154 --> 09:54.579
campus. You were in vet school when Mr. Rudder 
dies. Right. What did, how did you and your buddies

10:00.983 --> 10:04.228
hear about it? What did you all think? It was 
announced at Morning Chow, all of our

10:05.430 --> 10:12.080
announcements, and I didn't know him, but I knew a 
lot about him. I'd seen him, but, you know, seen his

10:12.761 --> 10:23.717
old bulldog wandering the campus and stuff, but, 
you know, you... What image did he have with you and

10:12.761 --> 10:23.717
your friends? Oh, about like John Wayne, I guess. 
And a lot of respect because, and I keep going back

10:27.051 --> 10:32.659
to this, but this is 1968, 1969. It was a tough time 
in America because of the Vietnam War. And we felt,

10:37.586 --> 10:44.496
we're in the Corps of Cadets, you know, we're 
different than the rest of the college campuses

10:37.586 --> 10:44.496
for many reasons. And Earl Rutter never caved, 
never changed. Quality was there, he was a neat

10:49.887 --> 10:57.075
guy, and yeah, it was, we didn't know him 
personally, but he was our leader. And did you go to

10:58.557 --> 11:01.140
the memorial service? I did, went through the 
rotunda there. I was not, the RVs were the honor

11:04.564 --> 11:11.112
guard there, and I was a sophomore, was not a Ross 
volunteer at the time, but I remember seeing

11:04.564 --> 11:11.112
Lyndon Johnson. Politically, I didn't care for 
him at all, but I thought, you know, it's a pretty

11:12.874 --> 11:18.240
big, Must have been a big man if you've got the 
President of the United States coming to visit.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.685
Yeah, that's right. He was President. He was 
President at the time. And all the others. This is

11:31.731 --> 11:34.093
not part of the interview to record. Guess how old 
Earl Rudder was when he died? I have absolutely no

11:37.737 --> 11:38.878
idea. One month short of his 60th birthday, and 
since he was a reserve officer, he did not qualify

11:46.807 --> 11:50.733
for veterans benefits. And even Olin Teague, his 
classmate, who was chairman of the House Veterans

11:50.753 --> 11:57.923
Affairs Committee, could not get an exception 
made for him. Amazing. You see, I'll be 70 next

11:59.385 --> 12:01.107
month. 60 is fairly young, I think. Oh, yeah. But by 
today's standards, he, and so Mrs. Rutter doesn't

12:05.293 --> 12:13.405
get I saw her at Rick Perry's swearing-in. Don't 
know her. She was in the company of two cadets and a

12:17.601 --> 12:22.485
pleasant lady. That's a shame. It really is. 
That's a travesty. Oh, yes. He did a splendid job.

12:29.251 --> 12:30.512
All right. Did you and your buddies, did you all 
have any image of Jack Williams when he becomes the

12:30.712 --> 12:36.597
president in the fall of 1970? Wasn't the same kind 
of guy. Wasn't cut from the same bolt. I don't

12:40.400 --> 12:42.002
really know somebody. I just remember calling him 
Smiling Jack. He was president, I guess for, I

12:43.658 --> 12:49.856
can't remember how many years. Six. Six years. 
Okay, about right. And my parents were Aggie

12:55.032 --> 12:57.820
Parents of the Year. around 76, 77, somewhere in 
there, but I believe he was still here. Yeah,

13:04.133 --> 13:07.518
because he becomes the system chancellor in 77. 
Okay. And Jarvis Miller becomes the president. He

13:11.063 --> 13:12.986
was still there because my folks were here. They 
met you. I'm sure you don't remember Dorothy

13:14.168 --> 13:21.498
Claytor, but we met at a little social as part of 
their weekend, parents' weekend. I was just

13:21.578 --> 13:28.127
gotten out of the service, was in practice in 
Pleasanton, and littlest brother Dan was

13:21.578 --> 13:28.127
probably junior in the Corps at the time, and We had 
all sent our letters in, and with four boys in the

13:28.613 --> 13:35.198
Corps, mom and dad were Aggie Parents of the Year, 
so kind of a neat deal. See, I tell people, only Earl

13:35.218 --> 13:39.113
Rudder could have made the changes he made. I don't 
think anybody else is strong enough, to be honest.

13:43.138 --> 13:53.799
I understand enough about politics and about 
leadership that it took somebody that had an

13:43.138 --> 13:53.799
ironclad will and the intestinal fortitude to 
stand up and say, this is how we're going to do it,

13:43.138 --> 13:53.799
boys. Then he lays the foundation, strong and 
firm. Then Jack Williams academically builds on

13:57.406 --> 14:01.033
it. And Rutter couldn't have done what Williams 
did, but vice versa. No, and I don't think any one

14:05.017 --> 14:07.340
man could ever have done it all. There's no way. But 
the school, they don't work that way. And look at

14:09.882 --> 14:10.943
this place today. I walked around here seeing new 
things, and some things don't change, but a lot of

14:11.003 --> 14:15.068
things do. Oh, yes. Back in your student days, you 
were in the Corps and all that. Tell me about when

14:23.036 --> 14:24.878
you got that ring. I remember going by, I believe it 
was the Koch Building. I believe that's where you

14:30.517 --> 14:38.287
paid your money, and I don't... Do you remember 
what it cost?

14:38.307 --> 14:44.074
I think it was $180, but I don't... That figure, 
that may be wrong. It's way less than what kids pay

14:44.775 --> 14:46.978
for. I don't know what they cost today. Do you know 
what they... $300 or $400, I don't know. And I

14:51.904 --> 14:55.168
remember putting it on and thinking... Gee, I just 
got here. And now, you know, I'm a senior. And this

15:01.813 --> 15:03.896
ring has literally been around the world. I was 
telling Kyle I was in a bar at the Oberoi Hilton

15:03.916 --> 15:11.884
Hotel in New Delhi, India in 1975. And two drinks 
show up, extra visit with a guy. And I said, no, we

15:16.008 --> 15:17.269
didn't order these. And he said, no, that 
gentleman did over there. And a guy does like this

15:19.672 --> 15:22.995
and gets up and walks over and Jack's somebody, 
class of 54. The guy says, how do you know each

15:24.973 --> 15:26.936
other? He said, we're brothers. And that was it. We 
didn't even visit. Just, yeah, you know. And he was

15:32.583 --> 15:39.252
over on some railway construction deal and ran a 
deal, but just saw the ring. That's all it took.

15:40.714 --> 15:41.575
Have you ever lost it? Left it in the bathroom in 
Vietnam, and

15:42.537 --> 15:49.286
the waiter brought it out to me. Can you imagine? 
And I'm one of the few veterinarians who haven't

15:52.169 --> 15:58.060
lost it in a cow. It has gone through linen service 
in San Antonio in the khaki pants we wear at the

15:58.080 --> 16:07.779
clinic, and they found it for me at Unifirst, and 
they returned it. And that's been it. I'm very

16:09.422 --> 16:10.524
careful. I hope I don't ever do it. When I 
interviewed... When I interviewed President

16:14.562 --> 16:34.849
Bowen, I asked him, and he said that when he was a vet 
student at Caltech, I believe it was, I mean a

16:14.562 --> 16:34.849
graduate student at Caltech, he's in Europe on a 
summer research trip, and he and two German

16:14.562 --> 16:34.849
buddies are on the train going from Vienna to 
Venice. And as they're going over the Alps, this

16:36.671 --> 16:44.181
lady is reading a newspaper and turns down and 
said, are you from Texas A&M? Well, yes, ma'am. How

16:45.532 --> 16:45.973
did you know? Well, I saw your ring. And he 
introduced himself. And she said, well, my name is

16:49.398 --> 16:52.002
Zachary. My husband, HB Zachary, is one of the 
biggest construction. And he was much impressed.

17:04.242 --> 17:11.513
Was there a camaraderie built in the vet school 
that was at all similar to the camaraderie built in

17:04.242 --> 17:11.513
the Corps? No. No. Although I have friends in vet 
school, and it was a fairly close class and fun,

17:12.715 --> 17:21.226
it's just not the same. It's a totally different 
experience. Totally different. But there's

17:24.770 --> 17:34.262
enough intensity in vet school that it does bring 
you together, and it's genuinely good to see my

17:24.770 --> 17:34.262
practicing colleagues, and some I've stayed very 
close to, but it's not the same as the Corps. Were

17:36.424 --> 17:40.189
there some events as a part of the three years in vet 
school that are important traditions, important

17:40.523 --> 17:48.934
binders? They would have an annual fish fry with, I 
think, seniors and faculty. And then they would

17:58.266 --> 18:07.037
have a get together, can't remember what it was, a 
barbecue or something, again, with like freshman

17:58.266 --> 18:07.037
students. A few things like that, that the senior 
fish fry, I got in a fight with David Hanselka, one

18:07.017 --> 18:23.838
of the clinicians,

18:07.017 --> 18:23.838
and he ended up biting a chunk out of my elbow, and 
I'm not a fighter, but it was just one of those, that

18:07.017 --> 18:23.838
was during our burnout stage with the large animal 
practitioners. Outside of a few get-togethers

18:25.981 --> 18:32.709
like that, you had your veterinary wives put 
together some socials. Most of those failed

18:32.769 --> 18:34.932
miserably. Were you married by then? No, no, I was 
single. I married when I was 30, so I was already

18:38.194 --> 18:41.522
about long since been out of school. But I was well 
treated by so many folks. They had an open door to

18:44.970 --> 18:47.376
many of us vet students. I look back on a lot of those 
vet wives and living with no money and working hard

18:50.318 --> 18:53.121
and husband going to school. I admire him. Where 
did you live after you finished those four

18:54.343 --> 18:59.249
undergraduate years or four core years? Well, I 
had the, of course, part of that was in vet school.

19:02.212 --> 19:08.399
So in the summertime, I was at Schumacher Hall and 
then back for my senior year in the core. But I'm

19:08.480 --> 19:10.162
still in vet school. And then when I got out of the 
core, we lived out until I finished vet school out

19:15.378 --> 19:18.962
On Travis Whedon's country, we used to have the old 
dairy and have some rent houses. Travis and Joyce

19:19.022 --> 19:21.905
Whedon, which were just wonderful people. And 
they fed us three or four nights out of the week.

19:25.509 --> 19:26.830
They made no money off of our rent. Wonderful 
people. And that's where I lived out in the country

19:28.712 --> 19:32.957
until I got out of vet school. Then immediately 
went on active duty and was overseas basically

19:33.237 --> 19:39.704
continually for a little over three and a half 
years. And then ended up in Pleasanton in 1976.

19:43.508 --> 19:48.557
Alright, so you, back to traditions for a second. 
You go through, at the end of your third year, you go

19:49.178 --> 19:58.575
through final review and become, in one way, a 
senior in the Corps. Right. Tell me about what it

19:59.997 --> 20:04.285
was like to put on those senior boots. That was, and 
that's another real special time. Obviously,

20:07.404 --> 20:10.368
you've talked to others, but you put them on for the 
first time. I got my boots made at Economy Boot and

20:10.408 --> 20:15.355
Shoe in San Antonio, Texas. Went down, a group of us 
went down, got them ordered, and they were a lot

20:16.336 --> 20:25.629
cheaper than Hollick's, and that has no bearing on 
anything, but it was a trip to San Antonio as

20:16.336 --> 20:25.629
juniors. We got measured, got them made. put them 
on for the first time. You beg, borrow, and steal

20:29.347 --> 20:36.341
pants and you buy old, your pants from other 
upperclassmen. Never buy anything new if you can

20:37.183 --> 20:38.766
avoid it. How much did your boots cost? Mine were, 
at that time I believe, were $90. And now was this

20:44.677 --> 20:48.565
your money or mother and dad's money? This was mine 
that I'd saved and got ready to spend it and got a

20:48.882 --> 20:56.212
check in the mail from my dad for the boots and the 
spurs. And he said, I didn't go to A&M, but I will,

20:56.273 --> 21:05.366
for everyone of y'all to become seniors in the 
Corps, I will buy your boots, which I appreciated

20:56.273 --> 21:05.366
very much.

21:09.051 --> 21:12.696
Put those boots on for the first time, and I 
remember Bob Shepard was had been a roommate and my

21:13.300 --> 21:36.405
outfit gave me a room by myself from my junior year 
on because I was the only one in vet school and back

21:13.300 --> 21:36.405
then that was a big deal to have a room by yourself 
and I probably didn't need it but it was

21:13.300 --> 21:36.405
appreciated but Bob had been one of my sophomore 
roommates he was from Hillsboro and he wanted to be

21:13.300 --> 21:36.405
my he said do you have an executive officer and I 
said no you're it and In fact, I saw Bob at Rick

21:36.385 --> 21:39.248
Perry's swearing in also. Good friend. Bob is a 
pilot for American Airlines. Putting on those

21:42.851 --> 21:48.457
boots for the first time and then walking back, 
there is not a bigger feeling in the world. You talk

21:48.477 --> 21:52.301
about being shot in the rear with importance 
because you're finally there. And you're

21:52.961 --> 21:56.124
clunking with those boots and you're feeling 
pretty good. And it's a neat deal. Did family come

21:58.106 --> 22:01.490
to find a review? They did. They did. My folks made 
every...

22:06.693 --> 22:17.287
to my knowledge, every final review that I was in, 
but for certain that's the only one I remember was

22:06.693 --> 22:17.287
that one and then of course the next year also, the 
true final review. All right, now that true final

22:17.847 --> 22:24.215
review as you phrased it, did you go through 
commencement then? Yes, I did. I got a degree in

22:25.597 --> 22:27.239
veterinary science. That was just a manufactured 
degree because you've done the hours. It's

22:30.984 --> 22:34.148
worthless, but did it and graduated. I want to 
graduate in uniform, not in a cap and gown. And that

22:36.882 --> 22:39.327
was good to graduate with my class. Did you and your 
buddies do any celebrating that night? No, I don't

22:43.515 --> 22:44.537
think so. I think I did my college. In fact, I know my 
folks were here and I had a set of almost surrogate

22:51.344 --> 23:00.880
parents that I'd met through my Colorado days in 
the summer, Michael and Nancy Kangurga from

22:51.344 --> 23:00.880
Henderson, Texas, both of them University of 
Texas graduates. I'm the first. They knew Jim

23:03.164 --> 23:07.952
Anderson well, but I'm the first Aggie in the Corps 
that they'd known well. They had a son that was a

23:07.932 --> 23:11.776
year younger than me that was at SMU. And they came 
down to my graduation. And looking back on it, I

23:14.779 --> 23:17.622
really appreciate it. They didn't need to do that. 
But they were in many ways like a second set of

23:18.664 --> 23:23.369
parents, because Henderson was a good bit closer 
to Midland. And as a vet student and as a senior in

23:23.389 --> 23:28.294
the Corps, I could retreat to Henderson 
sometimes. Now, your undergraduate degree was in

23:30.356 --> 23:33.680
G. Raleigh. Where was that veterinary 
commencement?

23:39.404 --> 23:40.525
Was it over there also? For some reason, I think it 
was. Well, in fact, I know it was. Yes, it was. And I

23:46.071 --> 23:50.816
guess we graduated in August, but there were 
others graduating at that time. But it was at G.

23:50.896 --> 23:53.399
Raleigh also. How are you holding up, Kyle? You can 
drift out if you need to. We're about done. All

23:59.785 --> 23:59.986
right. I don't have too much more. This is another 
editor's note. Sometime about in the early 70s, as

24:05.493 --> 24:22.470
dean of faculties, I was in President Jack 
Williams' office one day, and he tossed two

24:05.493 --> 24:22.470
letters at me, each written by the mother of a 
student who was scheduled to graduate that

24:05.493 --> 24:22.470
summer. A&M was not having summer graduations at 
that time, and these ladies were saying it wasn't

24:31.548 --> 24:35.473
that their sons had to wait until December to 
graduate. And both of them had a job that was going

24:35.653 --> 24:38.857
to take them far away. And they asked the question, 
why doesn't A&M have a summer commencement? And he

24:44.904 --> 24:46.105
said, what do you think? And we both agreed that 
they asked a very good question. Let's try it. And

24:51.772 --> 24:54.535
we both wondered, would anybody show up? And of 
course, summer commencement now is as well

24:54.869 --> 24:59.894
attended per person as any other. I'm sure it is. 
Sure. And nobody. And that was in 1970? That was in

25:03.117 --> 25:07.722
71, I think. It was pretty early. Because my 
commencement was in August of 73, and looking back

25:08.502 --> 25:16.770
on it, yeah, there had to have been, there was other 
people besides veterinarians there, that's for

25:08.502 --> 25:16.770
sure. And did you look carefully at the tube, at 
what was in your tube, to be sure the diploma was

25:17.671 --> 25:23.577
there? I'm sure I did. I don't recall. But you kind 
of, boy, I hope this thing's not empty. As you look

25:28.917 --> 25:42.952
back on your veterinary preparation, is there any 
change you now, if you had been in charge then,

25:28.917 --> 25:42.952
based on experience, any change in the 
curriculum? Curriculum I probably wouldn't

25:44.194 --> 25:46.697
change. I would

25:46.937 --> 25:53.344
probably specifically add some practice 
management courses. Dennis McKernan at LSU is big

25:54.134 --> 25:56.138
on this. However, you can lead a horse to water, but 
you can't make him drink. Until the financial

25:58.764 --> 26:02.331
pistol is at your head, you will not pay attention. 
So for the practitioner in me, I would say that. But

26:05.318 --> 26:06.861
no. I would probably give even more attention to 
internal medicine and surgery. Again, as a

26:15.188 --> 26:17.211
practitioner, because that's what I do. But for 
where we were in 1973, we were well educated. And I

26:22.740 --> 26:29.912
didn't realize this until I started dealing with 
physicians in Southeast Asia and then in North

26:22.740 --> 26:29.912
Africa, that I'd gotten a darn good education. I 
would have, and I'm glad they have gone to a

26:30.837 --> 26:35.183
four-year program instead of the trimester. It 
was hard on everybody. There was no time to relax,

26:37.887 --> 26:40.230
was there? No, and there was no time to make any 
money. And the financial onus, these veterinary

26:42.614 --> 26:54.851
students are getting out owing, even with time 
off, they're owing an average of $44,000 a year,

26:42.614 --> 26:54.851
and that's just the average. All right, again 
looking back, to what degree faculty members,

26:58.327 --> 27:07.413
advisors, would you most want to express your 
gratitude for what they did during those years?

27:08.436 --> 27:11.104
Who did the best job and how did they do it? Oh, I 
think everybody has favorite professors. Dr.

27:14.898 --> 27:20.152
Mike Herron, who's recently retired as an 
orthopedist, was a good clinical instructor.

27:21.256 --> 27:23.943
Again, I mentioned Mike Tatum and Gerald Bratton. 
What did they do that made the most sense? They

27:26.691 --> 27:27.874
cared about their students. And this is the one 
common thread.

27:32.802 --> 27:45.563
you know as an aside you can strike this from memory 
but you're still probably my most memorable

27:32.802 --> 27:45.563
professor from undergraduate days because well 
because you pushed me and and I learned in your

27:32.802 --> 27:45.563
class and I learned about myself

27:46.927 --> 27:49.671
because I don't remember the names of my other 
professors. They were there and they were fine,

27:51.093 --> 27:54.758
but I don't remember them. So you focus on, and it's 
the people that you've got something in return.

28:00.887 --> 28:10.401
You didn't just regurgitate, but you were pushed, 
you were exhorted, you were cajoled, you were

28:00.887 --> 28:10.401
encouraged, and you were counseled. Did anybody 
ever call you in and sort of kick your rear and say,

28:11.242 --> 28:16.410
hey, you can do this better and I'll get with it?

28:19.883 --> 28:21.125
Not to my knowledge. Gee, Wayne Stark did that in 
the MSC occasionally with student leaders. He did

28:27.234 --> 28:32.942
some, and I knew Wayne Stark, but I didn't, I can't 
think of any. I can sure remember a seventh grade

28:33.903 --> 28:38.350
teacher, Doris Watson, did that to me one day, and 
I'll never forget that. In vet school, as you look

28:38.750 --> 28:43.237
back, do you think you did about as well as you could 
have done? Did you work about as hard as you could

28:43.277 --> 28:45.460
have? No. No, I could have worked a whole lot 
harder, but I was in vet school, It was obvious I

28:49.583 --> 29:02.159
wasn't going to get, I wasn't going to flunk out and 
I wasn't going to leave and I was young and single

28:49.583 --> 29:02.159
and although, you know, A&M wasn't the cultural 
mecca of the world, it was all I had and I had the

28:49.583 --> 29:02.159
core. So I had, I had a lot of other stuff to do 
besides go to vet school. So I balanced, but I did

29:05.663 --> 29:14.714
enough to get by and did what I was interested in, 
but looking back on it, probably a little

29:05.663 --> 29:14.714
immature. If I was older, I probably would have 
taken more advantage of it. Let's see, one of the

29:17.545 --> 29:27.707
things that we should have asked about earlier, 
when you were an undergraduate, were you aware of

29:17.545 --> 29:27.707
the existence of secret fraternities? Now,

29:29.543 --> 29:39.738
Class of 72, I'm not, you know, I mean, we had our, a 
group of aardvarks as freshmen, as crowns, as

29:29.543 --> 29:39.738
materials. Wasn't aware of any, and may have been 
some, but there weren't any in the Corps that I'm

29:40.259 --> 29:51.174
aware of, and there weren't any others. We didn't 
have civilian students. I'm not sure, an

29:52.616 --> 29:55.821
interesting question.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.441
What creates Aggie spirit? What creates the 
devotion and feeling? Bonding with other people.

30:11.672 --> 30:14.196
Respect and loyalty for your fellow man. What 
encourages that bonding?

30:18.882 --> 30:20.104
An environment where By yourself you can't stand, 
but with your buddies you can. Coming together is

30:26.093 --> 30:27.194
one. Are there some events that are important? 
Your freshman year in the Corps of Cadets, and this

30:30.337 --> 30:40.326
is, I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, it's 
very difficult to feel a deep Aggie bonding

30:30.337 --> 30:40.326
without being in the Corps. I can't relate to it 
because I was never a civilian student as an

30:40.667 --> 30:52.217
undergraduate, but things like bonfire, like 
fetal pigs in the mess hall, or like mess hall any

30:40.667 --> 30:52.217
night of the week, you get a certain level of love, 
respect, and discipline from a family. And this is

30:59.209 --> 31:03.517
why gang members, this is what they think they're 
getting out of their gangs on the streets. I deal

31:04.659 --> 31:06.643
with gang members in Bible studies. The Corps of 
Cadets is a different kind of gang, but love,

31:08.145 --> 31:12.213
respect, and discipline in its own way. That's the 
central part of the Aggie spirit. Does bonfire

31:16.210 --> 31:18.615
yell practice? Every one of them. Every one of them 
add to the final sum, to the quotient. And if you

31:24.206 --> 31:28.574
take bonfire away, you need to replace it with 
something else as meaningful. It's more than

31:28.995 --> 31:31.039
cutting down logs and burning them. It's about 
bonding together. Stealing foot lockers is not

31:33.303 --> 31:37.712
about theft, but it's about bonding together.
