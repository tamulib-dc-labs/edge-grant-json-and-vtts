WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:07.368
had a horse and buggy, but somebody would invite us 
to ride. And the way I, that's how I learned to swim

00:07.889 --> 00:18.101
was the coach, the swim coach taught me, you know, 
on these picnics. And did the whole faculty go to

00:19.142 --> 00:21.445
the picnic? Well, whoever, you know, wanted to. It 
was just the social ones and, you know. What kind of

00:27.312 --> 00:29.915
food would be served? Oh, you'd bring your, have to 
bring your All your food. What was, at your house,

00:34.350 --> 00:37.636
what were your favorite things that y'all ate? 
Fried chicken.

00:43.646 --> 00:46.912
I can't think, but we ate well. What kind of cooking 
stove did your mother have? What did she cook on?

00:52.001 --> 00:54.285
Well, she cooked on a gas stove. And Mama didn't do 
much cooking. We always had a cook. Mama didn't do

00:59.110 --> 01:28.797
much cooking, but we always, I mean, had people 
living with us that paid us, I mean, I'm sure helped

00:59.110 --> 01:28.797
with the salary, but when the school crossed the 
street, when the music teacher came out from

00:59.110 --> 01:28.797
Bryant, she taught her music lessons in our house. 
And we got music lessons free for that, but then it

01:29.198 --> 01:34.865
didn't take. And then we had, well, Dr. Doak, maybe 
you remember him. Oh, yes. The Doaks lived in our

01:46.018 --> 01:49.982
upstairs for 13 years. This is Dr. C.C. Doak, and he 
taught what? He taught biology. Describe him.

02:00.913 --> 02:03.416
Well, he was just a nice little man. Where did they 
come from? Well, he had just fought in the war, and

02:06.098 --> 02:15.348
he came back there, and they both taught all the 
years, but they lived with us. Now, she taught in

02:16.068 --> 02:18.771
the A&M Consolidated School? Well, she didn't at 
first. She taught out in some of the other places,

02:19.952 --> 02:27.640
but she ended up teaching in... And they were 
pleasant neighbors? Well, they lived with us,

02:31.883 --> 02:34.245
yes. Now, when y'all ate, did they cook upstairs? 
No, they,

02:41.071 --> 02:49.639
well, they did a little bit of it, you know, but they 
didn't cook meals. They ate, I think, ate their

02:49.699 --> 02:57.306
noon meal out and then they just snacked after that 
with something upstairs. those of you who lived on

02:57.539 --> 03:25.318
the campus could you eat in sabisa did you all eat in 
sabisa dining hall much not unless we were invited

02:57.539 --> 03:25.318
for something special no did you was mr sabisa 
still around describe him well he was a very they

02:57.539 --> 03:25.318
were there a little little man i think he was cuban 
wasn't he austrian oh austrian okay but but But he

03:27.155 --> 03:28.156
was there. Now Mrs. Thompson now, Dr. Bazell's 
daughter, she told me that he drank a lot. I think he

03:38.211 --> 03:38.932
did. And chased around a lot. Well, that I don't 
know. They lived up there right across the street

03:42.377 --> 03:45.702
from where he was. Oh, they lived near Sabisa? 
Yeah, in the old house up there. Were there any

03:49.848 --> 03:54.394
Sabisa children your age? Oh, not any of my age. Oh, 
okay. They were grown, I think. Oh, they were

03:59.012 --> 04:01.034
older? I think they were grown. Okay. Let's see, 
and did y'all ever, you children, did y'all ever

04:04.276 --> 04:14.045
play tricks or pranks anywhere on the campus? Oh, 
I'm sure we did. Tried anyway. Were there any

04:20.031 --> 04:24.735
places on the campus that your father told you you 
were not to go? No, no. We would go, you know, in the

04:27.296 --> 04:36.125
YMCA they had the confectionery and we'd go up 
there to get us a drink and things like that. But

04:36.205 --> 04:39.688
there were no other places to go. Now, tell this 
machine about the Y. What happened at the YMCA?

04:48.537 --> 04:50.940
What all was there at the YMCA? Well, You got your 
hair cut. You went to the beauty parlor in the YMCA.

04:57.807 --> 05:01.714
And in the summertime, we had our swimming class. 
And all the kids, Ms. Marsteller, who Dr.

05:02.195 --> 05:07.024
Marsteller was on campus, And she went up there to 
the Y and supervised our swimming in the

05:07.291 --> 05:17.220
afternoons while our mamas took naps. But that's 
where we all went and swam every afternoon during

05:17.380 --> 05:25.188
the summer. In that conservative era, what was 
considered a proper bathing suit for a young lady?

05:33.235 --> 05:36.218
Well, they were long. One piece. One piece in my 
home, yeah. Were boys and girls allowed to be in the

05:41.107 --> 05:44.751
swimming pool at the same time? Oh, yeah, the kids. 
And at the confectionery, what all could we buy?

05:51.658 --> 05:58.025
Oh, I think it was just drinks and ice cream and 
things like that. And what other kinds of events

05:58.065 --> 06:04.652
occurred at the YMCA? Well, at Christmas time, we 
had a big party for the students that couldn't go

06:06.590 --> 06:18.486
home and had a big Christmas tree and had a program. 
And after 1918, when they had the women's club

06:19.267 --> 06:26.978
organized, They went up on the third floor up 
there. That's where they had their meetings. They

06:32.322 --> 06:35.386
had to crawl up there and carry all their food and 
everything. How they went up there, I don't know

06:35.406 --> 06:40.953
how my mother ever got up there, but she did. And 
please

06:40.973 --> 06:47.983
describe the Cashins. Mr. and Mrs. Cashin, they 
came in the 20s, I think. What were they? Describe

06:54.692 --> 06:55.733
them. Well,

06:57.738 --> 07:17.928
Mr. Matthews came before them, I think, as the Y 
director, and then Mr. Cashin, and they

06:57.738 --> 07:17.928
were just part of the campus like all the rest of us. 
Where did they live? They lived over by the

07:19.610 --> 07:22.294
hospital. And the hospital was about how big? It 
was a good-sized hospital. About how many rooms? I

07:32.241 --> 07:33.322
have no idea. Were you ever a patient there? No, no. 
Oh, no. We weren't patients there. Dr. Marsh, was

07:40.492 --> 07:44.959
he the doctor when you all came? No, Dr. Ellinger 
was the first. Ellinger. Ellinger, and then Dr.

07:48.183 --> 07:51.488
Marsh came later. Did the Marshes live on the 
campus? Yes, right across the street from the

07:54.181 --> 07:57.128
hospital. Describe him. What did he look like?

08:03.222 --> 08:10.658
Well, he was blondish and slender and a very nice 
man. Because I believe both of the Cashin boys have

08:11.718 --> 08:16.384
told me that he delivered them. Yeah, because they 
lived right there close, right behind Dr.

08:18.106 --> 08:25.156
Morrissey's on the little street back there. If a 
member of one of the faculty families had gotten

08:25.977 --> 08:33.066
sick, could they have gone to the campus hospital? 
I don't think so, but they may have been able to

08:33.547 --> 08:37.692
treat. I just don't know. We had a Brian doctor. How 
often did you all go to Brian? Not very often. As I

08:50.587 --> 09:04.523
say, we were late having a car, not as early as a lot 
of other people, and by the time you walked down and

08:50.587 --> 09:04.523
got on the streetcar and did all those things,

09:07.017 --> 09:08.839
When did y'all get your first car? Do you remember? 
No. It was a Saxon. Have you ever heard of a Saxon?

09:14.565 --> 09:14.925
No. Well, that's what it was. It was a Saxon. A 
Saxon. I mean, you don't know when in the 20s? Well,

09:23.555 --> 09:28.620
maybe earlier than the 20s. But anyway,

09:28.680 --> 09:35.067
I learned to drive it going to to church on Sunday, I 
was allowed to drive it. And so y'all would go, when

09:39.188 --> 09:46.557
your memory begins, did y'all go to Bryant Church 
every Sunday? Did you go down there regularly?

09:51.003 --> 09:52.865
Well, we went pretty regularly, yeah. Now, who 
else from the campus went to the Presbyterian

09:52.885 --> 09:57.731
Church that you remember? The Andersons, the 
Cashins?

10:03.751 --> 10:31.058
i don't know whether the andersons and the 
cashians ever went in brian i just i have no idea

10:03.751 --> 10:31.058
when were there some churches organized at 
northgate do you remember no when they started but

10:03.751 --> 10:31.058
it must have been in in the in the 20s all right um you 
you graduated from high school in 1925 25 i think it

10:03.751 --> 10:31.058
was and then went away to college Where did you go? 
Well, I went to Baylor-Belton because Dr. Hardy,

10:32.594 --> 10:44.112
who had been president at Mississippi A&M, was 
then the president. Well, I was supposed to go to

10:45.034 --> 10:57.613
A&M, and at that time they were allowing faculty 
daughters to go, and they cut me out the summer that

10:45.034 --> 10:57.613
I was going to go in the fall. They cut that out. What 
did your family think about that decision? They

11:03.177 --> 11:10.387
didn't tell me, but anyway, I went over to Baylor 
Belton. Let's back up just a second. What did you

11:12.330 --> 11:16.515
hear from the other faculty daughters? What was it 
like for them to be students at A&M? Well, see, I was

11:21.342 --> 11:28.071
15 when I went to college, and that's awful young. 
It is. I don't know whether we talked about it or

11:29.628 --> 11:33.172
not. Ethel was in Baylor at Waco, and I was in Baylor 
at the other one, and Julia across the street was at

11:33.192 --> 11:52.136
the University of Texas, and Mary Frapps was at the 
University of Texas. How did you get up to Belton?

11:57.640 --> 12:04.627
Well, they took me in the car with lots of tire 
fixing because we had lots of, you know. Had a lot of

12:04.768 --> 12:05.568
flats? A lot of flats. It took a lot of doing. And 
your major, what did you major in? Good times. And

12:14.538 --> 12:18.602
you were there how long? I was there two years, and 
then I went to SMU. for a semester and then I married

12:22.430 --> 12:25.575
when I was 18. Where did you meet this young man that 
you married? Oh, I met him as a freshman when he was a

12:28.899 --> 12:33.806
freshman and I married him when he was a senior. At 
A&M? Yeah. How did y'all meet? Well, he was in the

12:36.931 --> 12:46.024
band and we were up on the steps of the YMCA having a 
student

12:48.721 --> 12:50.163
Was it Yale practice? Yale practice. And I met him 
there as a freshman, and I married him when he was a

12:51.204 --> 12:54.708
senior. We married the beginning of senior week. 
What did your family think about your getting

12:58.653 --> 13:03.038
married that young? Well, I guess they lost. They 
lost. Tell me, where did he grow up? He grew up in

13:10.146 --> 13:11.007
Dallas. In Dallas? Mm-hmm. And his major?

13:23.838 --> 13:26.302
Isn't that awful? I should know. And where did you 
all live then right after you got married? He went

13:33.213 --> 13:44.450
to Victoria and took over the Victoria band and 
taught math in the Victoria High School. And how

13:44.471 --> 13:45.532
long were you all there? Oh, four or five, several 
years. And then where? Well, then we went to

13:50.483 --> 13:52.165
Yoakum. He took over the Boy Scout for 11 of the 13 
counties, and then we had to move to Yoakum. Well,

14:02.035 --> 14:05.920
that didn't last because then the Depression hit, 
and everything was gone. There was no money. So

14:07.742 --> 14:11.245
then we went to Cuero, and he taught in the schools 
in Cuero. For how long? Four or five years, and then

14:14.249 --> 14:16.491
we went to Bay City. where he was principal of the 
high school. And then they wanted him back in

14:18.817 --> 14:30.851
Victoria to take up, they wanted to organize a band 
and so we went back to Victoria and when he went in

14:18.817 --> 14:30.851
the service he was the dean of the Victoria Junior 
College. That's in World War II. Yeah. And then

14:35.656 --> 14:40.662
after the war, when did you come back to College 
Station? Well, I came, I lived at home two years

14:40.942 --> 14:45.988
while he was in the service in Germany. And then we 
went to Germany a little later. And then you came

14:54.946 --> 14:55.807
back. When did you move back to College Station? 
1960. 1960. We came from Panama. Okay. And so

15:02.575 --> 15:04.216
retired here? Yes. Okay. Let's see. Let's... How 
often, back to Belton, how often did you go back and

15:11.433 --> 15:16.861
forth? How often did you come home while you were in 
college? Well, as often as I could talk them into

15:19.706 --> 15:21.428
it. And we could take the train. You had to go to Waco 
and then come down. But you could take it. There was

15:29.080 --> 15:30.842
a train that you could take. And I came home for a lot 
of the dances. How much baggage did you carry back

15:34.268 --> 15:37.913
and forth? Oh, I suppose everything we had. But was 
that much? No, it wasn't a lot. And did you ever make

15:46.013 --> 15:48.716
any telephone calls? Oh, certainly, certainly. 
Do you remember when you all got your first

15:51.720 --> 15:55.065
telephone on the campus? Did you all have a phone 
when you first moved? I'm sure we did. Our number

15:58.890 --> 15:59.851
was 32. 32. 32.

16:03.536 --> 16:07.782
Students today cannot imagine that era. Was it a 
private line or a party line? Well, it was a party

16:11.334 --> 16:23.087
line, I guess, but you called and told the operator 
who you wanted and the number. And they would...

16:26.135 --> 16:30.039
But it was very important because that's how we got 
our groceries. We had to call them in every day.

16:33.141 --> 16:37.025
Let's go back to this, when you met this special 
young man. How did y'all meet? You said you met at a

16:39.927 --> 16:42.129
Yale practice? Yale, on the steps of the YMCA. And 
he was a freshman. He was a freshman. And you were

16:48.174 --> 16:50.136
still in high school. Yes. So I hurried through 
high school then. Uh, and did you then go with him?

16:57.827 --> 16:59.149
Where did y'all go on dates? Well, we were right 
there. No, but, I mean, did you go to football games

17:01.651 --> 17:04.754
and movies? Oh, no. He played in the band, and he 
played in the, in the Agadam Orchestra, so he never

17:05.194 --> 17:12.381
could take me anyplace. But, and, and the, we got 
married on a Saturday, and the next Saturday he

17:12.522 --> 17:20.209
played for the, the, uh, file of all the bag in an 
orchestra did and i had a date

17:20.982 --> 17:33.405
that describe the aggie land orchestra do you have 
any idea of when it was organized where did it No,

17:33.487 --> 17:45.222
but they played, they were earning their way 
through college is what they were doing and it was

17:33.487 --> 17:45.222
very good and they played all over the state of 
Texas. That's what I've heard. They did and it was

17:46.483 --> 17:59.359
at Christmas time and on holidays and things they 
played all over everywhere and Bill played with

17:46.483 --> 17:59.359
them after the The next year, when they needed him, 
he played with them, giving us some extra money,

18:00.453 --> 18:07.865
and because they needed him. What did he play? 
Trombone. Trombone. About how many were in the

18:11.891 --> 18:14.315
Aggieland Orchestra? I think about eight, and 
they were very good. Whose music did they copy? I

18:21.817 --> 18:26.404
have no idea. Do you remember any places they went 
that were kind of exotic or special? They played in

18:36.380 --> 18:46.796
Quero, and they played in Victoria, and then they 
played in West Texas, and they just played all over

18:36.380 --> 18:46.796
everywhere.

18:47.998 --> 18:49.640
Who ran the Aggieland Orchestra? Who? i think bozo 
briar did bozo briar yeah i don't know how that came

18:51.247 --> 19:15.111
to me but it did and so did he select the new members 
well yeah i think you probably probably had to try

18:51.247 --> 19:15.111
out because it was a very good orchestra and uh did 
did he make enough money to pay his a m expenses

19:15.648 --> 19:16.849
Well, it helped. You know, it helped. Now, you say 
he grew up in Dallas and came here and majored in

19:18.191 --> 19:23.617
what?

19:27.702 --> 19:28.523
Economics. Economics, I see. Who were some of the 
special people like, let's see, your father was

19:31.326 --> 19:42.178
teaching all those years in electrical 
engineering. And what was his... By then, yeah,

19:42.833 --> 19:47.980
all those years. He was a dean of engineering by 
then, I think. All right, now his nickname I know

19:50.423 --> 19:52.967
was Bear Tracks. What did he think about that 
nickname? It didn't bother him a bit. All right,

19:57.953 --> 19:59.636
describe him physically. He was a big man. How 
tall? I'd say about 5'10".

20:07.787 --> 20:08.768
Did he have big feet? No. Big, yeah, but he just, you 
know, they just called him Bear Tracks. Where was

20:14.196 --> 20:15.398
his office? In the electrical engineering 
building most of the time. Okay. Until he moved

20:23.069 --> 20:29.097
over into the other.

20:29.117 --> 20:33.343
Yeah, and you know, our son Bill, they called him 
Little Bear Tracks. uh-huh when he was in school

20:33.475 --> 20:59.415
who were some of the the if if i could be talking to 
your father today reckon who would he say were some

20:33.475 --> 20:59.415
of his special colleagues who were some of the 
special faculty members in the 20s

20:33.475 --> 20:59.415
well one of them i want to Mr. Dillingham who did 
the, you know, he and Nettie worked together and we

21:00.307 --> 21:13.337
had the first TV. because he built it himself and 
they did the first broadcast and it was, Daddy was

21:13.975 --> 21:26.854
sponsoring Mr. Dillingham and helping him who was 
in the electrical engineering department. The

21:26.874 --> 21:28.356
first radio broadcast. Yeah, radio. All right. 
Did your dad have a part in that, was this that first

21:30.279 --> 21:34.926
football game? Well, he just helped him, helped 
Dillingham get involved enabled him to do it, but

21:39.659 --> 21:43.549
he never did do anything. And that was in the 
electrical engineering building where they...

21:43.569 --> 21:50.125
Who selected the call letters for the I have no 
idea. Because I understand WTAW supposedly stood

21:53.446 --> 21:59.196
for Watch the Aggies Win. Well, I wouldn't be a bit 
surprised, but then that was, I think Dutch

21:59.437 --> 22:07.711
Dillingham was the first one to broadcast. Do you 
remember your dad being excited about that? Well,

22:11.337 --> 22:15.925
you never knew, you know. Yeah. When your dad 
became dean, how often did he have to go to Austin?

22:24.260 --> 22:30.355
Just when they were getting ready to get the 
appropriations. And did you and your family, did

22:31.668 --> 22:39.356
you all see the directors when the board of 
directors would come to meet? Oh, no. No, you know,

22:42.680 --> 22:44.442
there was a building over there. They had a 
building for them, and it was on the other side of

22:44.462 --> 22:49.527
the Spieser Hall. Yes, ma'am. And when they came, 
they came by train? I expect they did. And when the

22:57.807 --> 23:05.677
ball games, we'd have at least 12 or 15 special 
trains, you know, and they all lined up out there.

23:05.737 --> 23:11.744
And Mom and Daddy, every other Thanksgiving, they 
had at least 40 people for lunch. And then Mom would

23:11.824 --> 23:17.491
always have sandwiches and cake for them after the 
game before they went back. Describe going to an

23:17.712 --> 23:20.575
Aggie football game. But it was hot, and you wore 
your best dress on the first ball game in September

23:21.179 --> 23:30.456
and ruined your wonderful wardrobe because you 
didn't get with one new dress a year. And it was hot,

23:30.917 --> 23:33.842
but you wore it and sat out in the hot sun. All right. 
Did you usually sit with your parents, or were you

23:36.166 --> 23:42.157
over in the student section? I guess I was in the... 
I don't know. I just sat. My parents didn't go very

23:48.254 --> 23:50.758
often. My mother couldn't. She just was crippled 
and couldn't. Describe the Aggie band in those

23:55.905 --> 23:58.069
days. Oh, it was great, of course. And, you know, it 
played for our wedding. Mama was horrified

24:02.101 --> 24:06.706
because thank goodness it wasn't the size it is 
now. But they sat in Guyon Hall, they sat behind the

24:07.147 --> 24:12.913
stage so it was fine. But they wanted to play. Bill 
had been the soloist for the band for four years and

24:14.375 --> 24:19.901
they wanted to do it. So you were married in Guyon 
Hall? I was married in Guyon Hall. Who was the

24:23.285 --> 24:24.226
minister? Mr. Matthews. He had been here, and he 
was a Presbyterian minister, and he came back.

24:33.880 --> 24:36.504
Describe your dress, your wedding dress. Oh, it 
was a long white dress, and it was made in Waco. Do

24:40.410 --> 24:42.954
you remember what it cost? No, no idea. I didn't 
have to worry about that then. And did people come

24:46.760 --> 24:52.650
from long distance? Did you have a lot of 
out-of-town people? We had some out-of-town

24:54.481 --> 24:58.268
people, but not a lot. What were the special 
wedding gifts you remember? Oh, I don't know. I've

25:03.478 --> 25:04.520
got a whole list. I wouldn't give a single one of 
them up even today. And where did you all go on your

25:08.187 --> 25:10.671
wedding trip? Well, we went to Dallas. for 24 hours 
because he had to come back and play for the final

25:13.094 --> 25:24.407
ball, and he was taking his final exams in the 
afternoon of the wedding hoping he'd get through.

25:27.351 --> 25:27.831
Let's see. During that time, do you remember Aggie 
Bonfire? Oh, yes. Where was it held? On the drill

25:37.663 --> 25:38.403
field? Yeah, on the drill field. And what did they 
burn? anything that they could pick up. You had to

25:43.499 --> 25:47.105
watch very carefully not to put anything outside 
you wanted. And I remember when I was living at home

25:47.726 --> 25:59.964
for two years during World War II when Bill was 
overseas, my father came from the telephone, and

25:47.726 --> 25:59.964
he was dying laughing, and I said, well, what 
happened? And he said, there was a man crying on the

25:59.984 --> 26:02.888
phone. His truck was on top of the bonfire.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.998
Now, that's a very good item. That's a very good 
item. How did the students carry all of that stuff?

26:16.188 --> 26:24.481
They just managed to do it in the dark because, you 
know, it was just awful because you never knew what

26:16.188 --> 26:24.481
you were going to lose. Did they steal somebody's 
outhouse to put on there usually? Oh, yeah, yeah,

26:28.688 --> 26:30.250
yeah. Do you remember anybody getting hurt during 
Bonfire then? Not that I know of. Did they have

26:37.322 --> 26:39.745
silver taps in those days? Yes. Where was it held? 
At the administration. Just like it is now? I think

26:45.973 --> 26:46.854
so. Around Sully? I believe so. And then Final 
Review. That was on the drill field over there. And

26:56.848 --> 26:58.650
Commencement, where was it held? Do

26:59.373 --> 27:09.131
you remember any famous visitors, any 
celebrities that came to the campus? Oh, we had a

27:09.371 --> 27:10.513
lot. I came and I think

27:11.515 --> 27:23.457
some of the presidents came.

27:24.331 --> 27:53.713
um let's see bonfire oh uh aggie senior rings did do 
you remember when your husband-to-be got his ring

27:24.331 --> 27:53.713
i remember when he got his ring because i got one 
then they gave you know that was an engagement ring

27:24.331 --> 27:53.713
really and i have one it was was it describe it was it 
a miniature miniature really yeah didn't know

27:24.331 --> 27:53.713
that yeah yeah do you Do you have any idea what it 
cost? No. He couldn't much because he didn't have

27:57.270 --> 27:59.012
much. Did your husband ever lose his Aggie ring? 
Yes. He replaced it and he got one of those new ones

28:05.200 --> 28:09.465
that spoiled everything. The one time he worked in 
the yard. He lost it and never found it again. Never

28:15.934 --> 28:18.537
found it again, but he replaced it. Well, let's 
see. I'm trying to think of other things. All

28:24.883 --> 28:25.644
right, let's see. Did you have younger brothers 
and sisters? Two younger brothers. And they grew

28:30.069 --> 28:32.271
up on the campus also. Yes. And where did they go to 
school? They both went to A&M. And Frank, my

28:36.235 --> 28:45.505
brother under me, got a law degree from the 
University of Texas after he finished A&M.

28:45.825 --> 28:48.928
Preston was an architect in Houston, Frank. is a 
retired, he was General Counsel for Mobile, but he

28:49.111 --> 28:56.057
retired a number of years ago. And it was okay for 
them to go to the University of Texas? Well, yes.

29:01.983 --> 29:03.464
After they were Aggies? Yeah, yeah.

29:09.369 --> 29:16.536
As you look back, what is it about, what is it that 
builds A&M's spirit?

29:19.182 --> 29:21.505
What makes people so devoted to this school? It's 
there, and, you know, in the Army, we've lived all

29:22.927 --> 29:30.017
over everywhere, and it's been very special 
always. It's just there. Are there some events

29:32.140 --> 29:37.026
that create the spirit? I don't think so, but, I 
mean, that's just me. It's there. What effect did

29:44.478 --> 29:51.232
it have on your life that your family moved to 
College Station in 1909? Well, it was my whole

29:52.755 --> 29:54.478
life. It's all on you. How do you feel about A&M 
today? What thoughts do you have? Well, I'm very

30:05.392 --> 30:06.914
proud of it. It's a nuisance to have so many cars on 
campus, but then if you don't have a university

30:07.054 --> 30:15.966
that grows, you don't have a university. It had to 
grow. If someone were to give you a check for a

30:18.990 --> 30:26.280
million dollars and they put one restriction on 
it, that you had to give it to Texas A&M, but you

30:27.188 --> 30:34.362
could decide what A&M would do with that million 
dollars, what would you tell them to do with it? In

30:34.823 --> 30:39.051
other words, if you could make a big gift to A&M, 
what would you want it to go for? I guess I'd want it

30:40.414 --> 30:43.901
to go to the electrical engineering department. 
To do what? Whatever they wanted to do with it. All

30:50.965 --> 30:51.266
right. I have run out of topics. Well, that's fine. 
We've done well. Well, we sure have. We sure have.

31:00.028 --> 31:01.993
And I am very grateful to you. And we'll get this 
typed up and get it back to you soon. Well, I hope

31:06.064 --> 31:07.708
it's something you can use.
