WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:10.797
Apollo

00:03.727 --> 00:10.797
Soyuz. Apollo Soyuz. Yeah. We've been told the 
benefits, mostly in a diplomatic sense. What

00:19.069 --> 00:22.173
impact do you really think they had 
diplomatically in 1975? Well, I

00:22.193 --> 00:30.004
think it had a lot of diplomatic impact on... in the 
Soviet Union. They played it up much more than we

00:35.290 --> 00:37.393
did here. And I think

00:39.076 --> 01:00.227
that

00:39.076 --> 01:00.227
the

00:39.076 --> 01:00.227
only way that you ever change attitudes is

00:39.076 --> 01:00.227
in Russia. is sort of everybody together, 
long-term, or no single big event. You know,

01:09.487 --> 01:11.148
that's not true. No, it just takes time to change 
people's attitudes, and particularly to make

01:12.349 --> 01:21.898
them more friendly. You can make them an enemy real 
quick by doing something bad to them, but to make

01:21.918 --> 01:28.864
them friendly takes a long, long time, And it's 
just a matter of continuing to be friendly towards

01:29.620 --> 01:38.096
them and to do things towards them that they 
perceive as friendly. And so it takes a lot of

01:39.097 --> 01:40.881
effort. And you just have to go ahead and make the 
investment realizing that... that you're not

01:48.014 --> 01:54.426
going to just get an instant reward. And somebody 
said, Machiavelli or somebody said that in

01:55.288 --> 02:03.643
matters of importance, you can't hope to sow and 
reap at the same time. And that's a case like the

02:03.623 --> 02:06.466
Russian. You can't hope to reap all the 
friendship. You can only sow and then sow again in

02:08.869 --> 02:18.961
another year or two and then continue to sow good 
deeds and hopefully someday you can reap the

02:08.869 --> 02:18.961
benefits. But you can't be disappointed because 
you don't reap them initially because you're just

02:19.842 --> 02:24.628
not. It's not the way of the world, I don't think. 
You're talking like we haven't reaped the

02:27.471 --> 02:29.754
benefits yet. Or maybe we have a little bit. But I 
think that we ought to jump at the chance to do that

02:32.986 --> 02:54.168
because being friends with them is so much better 
than fighting them that you ought to just, any

02:32.986 --> 02:54.168
chance, if they came up and said, well, let's have 
this little get-together and do this and this, if

02:32.986 --> 02:54.168
there's any way we could do it with not 
jeopardizing our own defense posture or

02:32.986 --> 02:54.168
something like that, we ought to go do it. I mean, we 
ought to do everything we can to up the trade with

02:54.308 --> 03:02.757
them and to exchange non-military things with 
them and... to try to be friendly because you want

03:03.327 --> 03:07.692
to end up being friends with those people. You 
don't want to fight them. You just have to, you

03:09.814 --> 03:13.698
know, in order to be friendly, you've got to be 
friendly.

03:17.442 --> 03:24.689
So I think it was really good, but I don't think we 
could look for any benefit at the moment. It's more

03:24.709 --> 03:26.651
of a long-term kind of thing. Did you see any 
negative things come out of it?

03:33.162 --> 03:35.224
I didn't see any negative things. I think we taught 
them a lot that's helped them make their space

03:36.605 --> 03:41.430
program better. In other words, I think the thing 
that we taught them was generally an attitude

03:41.470 --> 03:59.407
about man in space can do things and to go ahead and 
try it, try to repair it on orbit, try to figure ways

03:41.470 --> 03:59.407
to make things work where they never seemed to have 
that attitude before. So I think they gained a

03:59.588 --> 04:03.051
tremendous benefit from that I don't feel that we 
gained much of a benefit, because we were so far

04:04.043 --> 04:18.840
ahead of them in all these areas, that we're going 
to have to look to increased friendship as the

04:04.043 --> 04:18.840
benefit, which they can too. We've gone more than 
halfway, but I think that you want to go more than

04:19.721 --> 04:24.907
halfway if you have to. I mean, even if you have to go 
90% of the way, eventually if it leads to

04:25.067 --> 04:31.755
friendship... Go the 90%, you know, it's worth it. 
So I'm glad we did it, and I think we ought to do it if

04:34.161 --> 04:40.292
we have another chance. Okay, the Soviet Union has 
taken foreign nationals in space with them. Yeah.

04:48.545 --> 04:50.749
Why do you think the U.S. has not done that in the 
past?

04:55.838 --> 04:57.220
I don't think...

05:01.081 --> 05:05.305
I don't think it would be a nice thing to do. 
However, I don't think anybody perceived it as

05:05.345 --> 05:17.437
nice a thing to do as

05:05.345 --> 05:17.437
just doing the job we had to do. For example,

05:17.517 --> 05:27.727
I don't know if France would like us better if we 
took a Frenchman in space or not. I think we'd

05:27.927 --> 05:29.569
eventually do it. But, and I think with Space 
Shuttle we ought to try to include multinational

05:30.427 --> 05:38.436
crews and things. But before we've been trying to 
do certain scientific things and although we

05:39.857 --> 05:53.072
could have done it with foreign nationals,

05:39.857 --> 05:53.072
it was easier to do it and not worry about that part 
of the problem. And I don't know if it would have,

05:57.815 --> 05:58.616
helped us anymore. You know, these things are 
helpful, but they're long-term helpful. I guess

06:06.107 --> 06:11.936
we'll end up taking some Frenchmen, because we 
have some in the space lab.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.322
Claude Nicollier, nice guy. He's really Swiss. So 
I don't know. I guess we could have. We just didn't

06:21.070 --> 06:23.553
put that as a high priority. It's sort of like we 
probably could have found... a black person that

06:26.232 --> 06:35.222
knew enough, that knew enough flying or something 
to go to the moon. But it was,

06:36.404 --> 06:44.373
the best qualified people we had weren't, so we 
didn't do that. But we could have, I mean, you could

06:44.933 --> 06:53.303
have put a black person in the right seat of any 
lunar mission, I think you'd have been just as

06:44.933 --> 06:53.303
successful as it was. But I guess we didn't worry 
about that so much as trying to get the best

06:53.570 --> 07:00.097
qualified people we knew. You know, almost 
speaking of NASA, I don't know, it's early years,

07:01.639 --> 07:06.525
it's being self-centered. Like, you know, in its 
own organization, do you think we're basically

07:06.745 --> 07:19.459
just concerned with our own interests in our own 
program and not necessarily? Apollo Soyuz was

07:19.840 --> 07:21.822
a... an open gesture. But besides that, would you 
say it's mostly been closed within itself?

07:33.535 --> 07:35.678
Well, I...

07:37.099 --> 07:40.403
I don't think of it exactly the same way you said it 
there. I think that NASA is charged with doing

07:41.504 --> 07:49.494
certain things in space for the government, you 
know. And as a result... And no one else is charged

07:53.425 --> 07:56.329
to do those things. So I think you then begin to 
think on how you're going to do them for the

07:57.391 --> 08:04.982
government. I mean, you know that you work for 
Congress and the president, but still your job is

08:05.002 --> 08:12.532
to do such and such in the best way. And so... you do 
tend to get to be a closed unit because you're the

08:16.848 --> 08:21.774
ones that are working on it and thinking about it. 
Not very many other people are. For example, those

08:24.297 --> 08:32.106
of us in NASA aren't wondering whether or not they 
ought to build additional Trident submarines. I

08:32.286 --> 08:34.469
mean, we're not qualified to say. We don't do 
studies on it. And we're counting on the people

08:35.970 --> 08:44.440
that Congress has appointed in charge of the Navy 
to do that part of the job. It's a little bit like a

08:44.500 --> 08:46.703
football team. You kind of know what the other 
people are doing, but you've got a certain man to

08:46.919 --> 08:52.645
block or you've got to run out for a pass. And if 
you're supposed to run out for a pass, you better

08:53.826 --> 09:02.275
not worry about what the other guy's doing so much 
is trying to do your job. If you can do your job and

09:02.315 --> 09:04.217
help him, that's great. But generally, you know, 
you have to do your own job. And our job was

09:08.081 --> 09:12.785
exploration of space, so I guess we tended to 
concentrate on that. And... I didn't see us as

09:16.720 --> 09:22.268
closed, other than just the fact that we were the 
only people working on the job. We weren't trying

09:24.631 --> 09:26.033
to keep anybody out. Okay, along with the space 
shuttle, do you see any reasons that it didn't meet

09:28.676 --> 09:43.757
its original time schedule, the projected time 
schedule, other than the monetary problems that

09:28.676 --> 09:43.757
it involved? Well, yeah, I think probably that the 
people that were making the decisions realized

09:45.948 --> 10:05.354
that it was going to take longer and more money to do 
the shuttle than they

09:45.948 --> 10:05.354
could sell the program on. And so they said, let's 
be as optimistic as we can. Let's don't be

10:11.582 --> 10:15.567
dishonest and lie, but what... What is the 
earliest we can do it? What's the cheapest we can do

10:19.601 --> 10:21.083
it? I mean, think cheap, think soon. And you know, 
when you start doing things like that, you can

10:23.706 --> 10:33.617
convince yourself that things

10:23.706 --> 10:33.617
could happen pretty quick, pretty cheap. And be 
honest, you know, honest. Because it's just a

10:35.639 --> 10:38.783
guess, an educated guess. I mean, it's more than 
just sitting here guessing, but it's still a

10:38.823 --> 10:43.208
guess, just with more details. So I think they 
tried to guess on the short side because it was more

10:43.964 --> 10:51.638
palatable. It's like the president right now, 
playing like he didn't know there was going to be a

10:52.460 --> 10:56.387
recession. At the same time, he was going to stop 
inflation. I mean, how was he going to do it? If he

11:01.176 --> 11:04.643
didn't put people out of work, how was he going to 
keep people from spending money? I mean, it's

11:04.763 --> 11:05.905
like... You've got to have one without the other. 
He's going to give them more money and hope they

11:08.752 --> 11:12.880
don't spend more and thus make more inflation? I 
mean, it doesn't make sense. The only way that he

11:13.802 --> 11:18.432
can stop inflation is to get a recession and cut 
people's money off. Then they don't have money to

11:19.074 --> 11:23.944
spend, and then the prices come down.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.827
But you notice he never says that. He never says, 
look, I knew this was going to be this way. Do you

11:31.331 --> 11:37.278
know any other way to stop people from spending 
money other than cut their money off? I mean, he

11:37.298 --> 11:38.779
never says it that way. But, you know, he's got to 
know it. I mean, he's dumb. And so I think

11:44.186 --> 11:52.395
what occurred was was there was this optimistic 
estimate, because I don't think we really ran into

11:53.202 --> 12:06.276
any

11:53.202 --> 12:06.276
more unknown problems than we would expect. We had 
trouble with the tiles and the engines. But in a big

12:08.558 --> 12:15.906
development program like that, you know you're 
going to have trouble with something, so maybe we

12:08.558 --> 12:15.906
didn't know it was those two things. However, we 
knew two or three things would pop up. so i think

12:19.932 --> 12:40.253
more it's more of and probably when they allowed 
time they didn't allow time to solve those because

12:19.932 --> 12:40.253
they congress wanted something happening i mean 
you know the car dealer saying man we can get your

12:19.932 --> 12:40.253
new car in six weeks six weeks later they're 
telling you it ought to be in any day and it really

12:19.932 --> 12:40.253
comes in and In ten weeks, and they knew all along it 
was going to be ten weeks. Now, they had a couple

12:44.366 --> 12:46.228
come in in six weeks. But generally, it's ten 
weeks. But they never tell you ten weeks because

12:48.110 --> 12:50.433
you don't want to hear it. You want to hear six 
weeks. Because if you don't, you go to the other

12:52.075 --> 12:54.719
dealer and they tell you six weeks. You buy from 
them. So, it's just the way of the world. It's one of

13:02.913 --> 13:05.797
the reasons I don't want to do any of that sort of 
thing. I don't want to be part of that kind of thing.

13:09.402 --> 13:11.585
I don't want to tell Congress something like that. 
What is NASA's plans after the space show? I think

13:16.993 --> 13:27.387
NASA's plans, as soon as we get it going and try to 
get a lot of paying customers, then begin to start

13:16.993 --> 13:27.387
constructing some sort of space station. And I 
think this will happen uh... within ten years

13:31.803 --> 13:56.494
because we'll have all the elements and we can 
build space stations not cheap but not anywhere

13:31.803 --> 13:56.494
like it cost to go in apollo or to build a space 
shuttle so uh... i look for uh... some sort of new

13:31.803 --> 13:56.494
start here in another four years let's say when 
reagan gets let's say if reagan were re-elected

13:57.217 --> 14:17.706
then he would know it was his last term by then he 
would start to have the economy under control I

13:57.217 --> 14:17.706
think and when he did then he would be looking for 
something like this to help the economy and to help

13:57.217 --> 14:17.706
progress and if he's the kind of person Reagan is 
strikes me as the kind of man that would He's very

14:18.445 --> 14:22.249
much interested in research and development and 
keeping a good defense. He seems like a person

14:22.269 --> 14:25.714
that's not just doing something for today. He's 
trying to get the Social Security thing on a paying

14:26.134 --> 14:29.578
basis. He was recently voted down by a bunch of 
congressmen that know damn well that it ain't

14:30.239 --> 14:36.927
going to float if they voted it, and they still 
voted it. So he seems to have more guts. So my guess

14:41.212 --> 14:48.300
is he'll want the space program to enlarge, but he 
can't do it now because of the money. What about any

14:49.073 --> 14:54.081
unmanned plans, just continuation of 
exploration of our planet? That, just like that,

14:54.482 --> 15:02.935
and try to get some little programs so that people 
won't lose interest. But his biggest problem is

15:02.975 --> 15:07.302
the economy and defense. And so as a result of that, 
even though he might want to do these, he can't.

15:12.367 --> 15:17.754
He's caught in a terrible situation where people 
have left him with lots of debts. You know, all

15:18.775 --> 15:31.973
these debts, it's like somebody... What's 
occurred here is like my parents and me partly, in a

15:18.775 --> 15:31.973
way, have run up tremendous credit card debts We 
just lived high, you know, and bought all sorts of

15:32.054 --> 15:34.620
stuff. Right now, you and me too at the end, but your 
generation, somebody's got to pay the debts. I

15:42.777 --> 15:49.692
mean, somebody's got to pay for the new car, 
figuratively speaking, my parents got that

15:42.777 --> 15:49.692
couldn't afford... Somebody's got to pay for it. 
Sooner or later, the guy comes around, okay? And

15:55.430 --> 16:02.620
the story about, you know, we're all just 
borrowing from each other doesn't work because

15:55.430 --> 16:02.620
people borrow from each other, but you still got to 
pay it back. So that's what happened. The people of

16:06.245 --> 16:13.214
last generation, our generation, have lived way 
beyond their means and run it up on a credit card,

16:06.245 --> 16:13.214
the tune of a trillion bucks. And sooner or later, 
you got to pay because the guys that owe the money to

16:14.255 --> 16:19.122
want to be paid. And they left that with Reagan, and 
he's not even paying off the debt, you know. He's

16:26.173 --> 16:28.857
just trying to service the interest. Can you 
imagine what our life would be like if we had to

16:29.377 --> 16:38.190
spend more money per year than we made to live and 
pay the interest on our debt? I mean, it wouldn't

16:38.290 --> 16:41.114
work as an individual at all. It doesn't work as a 
country either. But that's what's occurred, and

16:43.257 --> 16:46.100
so it's just tough on him. But at least he's trying. 
How do you assess the pluses and minuses of your

16:48.683 --> 16:51.908
whole career?

16:54.613 --> 16:56.135
Hadn't been any minuses. Hadn't been many 
minuses, no. So it was all worth it? Oh, yeah, it was

17:00.803 --> 17:02.406
all worth it. It was great. I had a lot of heartaches 
because I didn't maybe fly on Gemini and want to,

17:02.987 --> 17:10.259
but then it turned out okay. No, I would... At the 
time, you know, I may wanted to do this or do that and

17:14.941 --> 17:20.471
didn't get to do it. But all in all, it just was a 
wonderful adventure. And I was lucky and got to

17:24.218 --> 17:28.846
make two flights. But I mean, even if only got to 
make one, it would be worth it. I mean, if I'd only

17:31.671 --> 17:36.139
made one flight, I would still give you the same 
answer. And it's also, when you're waiting,

17:36.592 --> 17:41.277
you're not just standing around the room waiting. 
I mean, you're doing things that are interesting.

17:45.382 --> 17:50.628
And also, you're educating yourself in a lot of 
things. And the opportunities for learning

17:51.509 --> 18:02.061
things and all

17:51.509 --> 18:02.061
the things that went along with the space program 
could never, ever be gained anywhere else. And so

18:02.722 --> 18:03.763
I... If I had to give the rest of my life for it, you 
know, stay in NASA and be repetitive, let's say

18:05.920 --> 18:15.665
train new astronauts over and over again, it would 
definitely be worth it. I don't have to do it, which

18:15.945 --> 18:21.038
is just luck, and I can go off and start a brand new 
career that I like. But... No, I can't think of a

18:23.437 --> 18:25.761
negative. At the time, they seemed it. And 
certainly I could invent a career that was better.

18:30.028 --> 18:35.918
I mean, I could have flown a couple of flights in 
Gemini, and then I could have made the first lunar

18:30.028 --> 18:35.918
landing instead of Neil. I mean, I could have done a 
lot of other stuff that would have been even more

18:36.238 --> 18:39.384
fantastic. But, you know, you don't really expect 
that. You just expect... You just can't hardly

18:47.450 --> 18:57.181
expect to do more and have a happier 18 years than 
what would I do that was better. I gave you some

18:57.281 --> 19:01.766
examples, but you really can't expect them. 
You've got to be happy with what comes along. How do

19:05.671 --> 19:16.984
you think being an astronaut affects, not 
necessarily you personally, but basically being

19:05.671 --> 19:16.984
an astronaut affects those men's later lives? 
gives them a great freedom to be like they really

19:18.432 --> 19:22.339
are. And so it satisfies

19:22.559 --> 19:38.086
the need to be famous or recognized or somebody 
saying you're a good person, you know, or you're

19:22.559 --> 19:38.086
brave or something, which men like. And so it 
satisfies that. And then once it's satisfied...

19:43.002 --> 19:44.505
then it lets you go beyond it. Whereas if that's not 
satisfied, I don't think you can go beyond it. It's

19:48.872 --> 19:52.639
a little bit like mounting a hill or a mountain. 
Unless you mount those hills of being famous,

19:53.400 --> 20:00.112
worthy, and all that, you can't ever get beyond 
them. And so I think what it does is it lets people go

20:00.272 --> 20:03.458
beyond that. It lets them get to the top, they see 
that, and then they... They can climb another one

20:08.737 --> 20:11.621
higher if that's what they want. Or they can go down 
and do something else. But it's a great thing for

20:16.629 --> 20:32.292
your personal life because it fills an incredible 
square in

20:16.629 --> 20:32.292
your life that you've always wanted to fill. And if 
you don't, will have, I think, a detrimental

20:34.066 --> 20:37.050
effect. So I think it couldn't be better. I mean, it 
just couldn't be. Now, I think you've got to go in

20:41.315 --> 20:49.947
with the attitude that a lot of this is out of your 
control. And so you're going to tend to accept what

20:50.688 --> 20:55.053
you get as good. You know what I mean? I mean, like I 
said, I gave you a career that was a lot better than

20:56.515 --> 21:00.901
mine, okay? But I... if i couldn't be happy with the 
one i had it'd be something wrong with me i mean

21:03.749 --> 21:27.478
that's the same way with everybody that flew i mean 
if they couldn't be happy with the career they had

21:03.749 --> 21:27.478
there's something wrong because we had the very 
best thing you could have and if everybody's got to

21:03.749 --> 21:27.478
be neil armstrong something's wrong i mean you got 
to get a better attitude you've got to get an

21:28.302 --> 21:35.029
attitude that what you get out of it, you like, 
because the opportunities were there for so much

21:28.302 --> 21:35.029
other than just the flying. I mean, you got to meet a 
lot of people. And really, one of the things I liked

21:37.292 --> 21:41.036
the best was I did. I got to meet a lot of people that 
were successful or famous or rich or a lot of other

21:41.056 --> 21:47.643
things. And you really, then you can look around 
and sort of decide, with the knowledge instead of

21:52.282 --> 22:20.702
wondering what it's like you can see what it's like 
and then you can decide for your own life what

21:52.282 --> 22:20.702
you're going to do with it whereas maybe if maybe 
for example you didn't see how rich people lived in

21:52.282 --> 22:20.702
the life they have you would always want that life 
you still might you might want to eat more but by

21:52.282 --> 22:20.702
seeing it then you can make a more educated 
judgment unto what you want to do so being an

21:52.282 --> 22:20.702
astronaut lets you look at all the options 
available in life and then you could pick the one

22:21.087 --> 22:47.550
you wanted to go for, like your dad did, or I did, or 
somebody else, and be content to, and not really be

22:21.087 --> 22:47.550
going this way, and wish you were going that way, 
and a lot of people never get here, because they

22:21.087 --> 22:47.550
also want to go back over here, and you can't go both 
places, and they go this way, and then they go this

22:21.087 --> 22:47.550
way, and then this way, and they never really just 
say, this is better, and I realize I'm giving up a

22:21.087 --> 22:47.550
lot of here, and I'm just going to go that way, and If 
I get here and didn't want to go there, then I'll

22:48.256 --> 22:50.920
come back. But I'll never get here unless I go there 
and I realize that by going here, I can't go there

22:51.000 --> 22:57.509
simultaneously. So

22:57.589 --> 23:07.023
there's an old story that a ship is a very lucky 
thing because it can only go to one destination at a

22:57.589 --> 23:07.023
time. But if you look at the history of a ship, then 
it goes lots of places. But if people were like

23:11.469 --> 23:15.495
that, they'd be much better off too because then 
they can go. Because they can only go one place at a

23:15.745 --> 23:18.689
time, but they don't know it. And so they go like 
this, and they really want to go here, here, or

23:19.290 --> 23:28.842
here, and they spend their life doing this, and 
finally they say to hell with it, I can't make it.

23:29.183 --> 23:33.548
And really, they could have gone just like this 
with a lot less trouble. So I think NASA helps a lot.

23:38.775 --> 23:42.360
It's one of the luckiest things to ever happen to 
anyone.
