WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:04.260
No, no. Drink, predominantly alcoholic would 
have been beer. On the other side, it was Coca-Cola

00:10.868 --> 00:14.312
on this campus. You couldn't go anywhere without 
running into a Coca-Cola vending machine. Was

00:20.038 --> 00:23.042
Whiskey Bridge operating in those days? No, sir. I 
don't believe so. It had already closed down. I

00:25.364 --> 00:28.468
have no recollection of Whiskey Bridge. other 
than from maybe the 60s when I heard stories about

00:28.448 --> 00:34.096
Ed's Hard Liquor. He was down here and then Whiskey 
Bridge was over.

00:41.646 --> 00:46.052
Was liquor by the drink legal yet in Brazos County? 
Oh yes. Margaritas and so forth? No, I don't

00:51.999 --> 00:56.886
remember margaritas being a very popular drink.

00:59.482 --> 01:02.909
I really don't know what the, piña coladas is what I 
remember. And in terms of smoking, were you and

01:03.289 --> 01:16.214
your buddies even aware of the vocabulary of drugs 
and marijuana and so forth? Were those words even

01:16.335 --> 01:17.697
known? Yes, I probably was because of the border uh 
atmosphere of drugs but uh even in laredo haskell i

01:20.643 --> 01:42.820
was not exposed to a drug culture or students who 
smoked pot or marijuana or cocaine or heroin did

01:20.643 --> 01:42.820
anybody here that you ever heard of let me tell you i 
i was at a lot of parties i was uh I was in a lot of

01:44.892 --> 02:02.884
apartments, dorm rooms, cars, concerts, and 
yeah, I saw a few people smoking marijuana, but I

01:44.892 --> 02:02.884
never saw any cocaine, heroin, LSD, or drug sales 
or anything like that. And

02:04.602 --> 02:09.151
the chicken ranch was long gone. Long gone. Just a 
myth to us. I have not heard any Aggies talk

02:13.079 --> 02:24.602
anything about any kind of prostitution anywhere 
in Brazos County that they ever heard of, or

02:13.079 --> 02:24.602
bootleggers. Now, there was a massage parlor 
called Lady T's or something like that out on

02:24.582 --> 02:31.473
Highway 6 on the way to Houston. And some friends of 
mine said they had been there and that they were

02:33.316 --> 02:44.194
offered services beyond that of a massage parlor, 
but that's all I know. All right. As you look back,

02:46.539 --> 03:06.223
who were some people that if you had the capability 
to thank them personally for what they meant to

02:46.539 --> 03:06.223
you, who are some people who were here in whatever 
capacity that you now realize had an important

02:46.539 --> 03:06.223
effect on your life? Well, I'd say Herb Thompson 
would be the first and foremost academically.

03:11.530 --> 03:15.615
Edwin Cooper was a guy that was somewhat of a 
guardian angel, even though I didn't know it.

03:16.169 --> 03:19.854
probably helped me get in and out of Texas A&M. 
Frank Litterst was a guy that adopted me and just

03:21.656 --> 03:26.042
always I knew was there. You know, he wasn't part of 
the campus per se, but A.W. Head-Davis, a local

03:31.689 --> 03:45.788
attorney, was a classmate of my father's in the 
class of 45 and just felt like a security blanket,

03:31.689 --> 03:45.788
somebody I knew if I had trouble, particularly 
being an attorney, although I never needed him for

03:31.689 --> 03:45.788
anything. And Buck Wyrus, of all people, who even 
as a nobody student encouraged me to come by and see

03:45.768 --> 03:53.245
him. All right, for the sake of this machine, 
describe Buck Wyrus for somebody that might never

03:53.305 --> 03:58.236
have met him. Buck Wyrus never met a stranger. 
Never met a stranger. um buck absolutely loved to

04:03.368 --> 04:26.018
talk about texas aggies now you've heard about 
people who and a lot of aggies are this way who love

04:03.368 --> 04:26.018
to talk about texas a m and i think that's that's 
admirable and it's true and it's accurate it's a

04:03.368 --> 04:26.018
big part of our culture but buck wirus in my 
experience with him loved to talk about Texas

04:27.162 --> 04:31.908
Aggies. I maintained a lifelong relationship 
with Buck until the day he died and had great

04:34.171 --> 04:48.729
respect for him and admiration for the network and 
the recollection and the intimate knowledge he

04:34.171 --> 04:48.729
had of Aggies worldwide. It was just phenomenal. 
And I never knew Buck, in my presence, to be down. He

04:59.136 --> 05:01.778
always seemed upbeat, positive, energetic. If 
Buck ever had a down day, I'm unaware of it. And he

05:07.904 --> 05:09.365
had to have them in this role. I know that. I know 
that.

05:14.630 --> 05:17.913
How did A&M, let's see, we got off on Buck. Where are 
some other people that you remember with

05:17.953 --> 05:21.857
gratitude? I mentioned Frank Litterst. That's 
L-I-T-T-E-R-S-T.

05:31.608 --> 05:33.692
Yes, that's right. And his wife Royce. Just very 
gracious people, always good to me. Wally Groff

05:41.346 --> 05:53.228
was a guy that I remember at a time when I needed 
something and it involved athletic tickets

05:41.346 --> 05:53.228
because I'd lost some tickets my dad had sent me. 
And I just went over and pleaded my case to Wally

05:53.208 --> 05:59.214
Groff, and he took the time and listened to me and 
shook my hand and took care of me. That was a big deal

06:00.836 --> 06:01.636
to me. And he was then the ticket manager? He was 
actually the athletic business manager is what he

06:03.598 --> 06:07.082
was, yes. And I just remember that. Harry Green was 
the assistant or associate executive director of

06:11.346 --> 06:20.515
the then Aggie Club and had come to Laredo and given 
a speech. with Buck and I went by to see him when I was

06:20.495 --> 06:38.605
in school and he encouraged me to get involved in 
the then student Aggie Club and I did and

06:20.495 --> 06:38.605
ultimately became the first president of that 
organized group in 1978 and 79 and that was a great

06:20.495 --> 06:38.605
experience for me. It provided me with some 
leadership opportunities. So Harry was a good guy

06:41.309 --> 06:42.992
to know. Anyone else? Oh, I'm sure there are. I 
could probably go on and on and on. As you look back,

06:48.875 --> 06:56.907
how did, how well did A&M prepare you for the real 
world of employment and so forth? How did, did A&M

06:57.228 --> 07:00.172
play any role in your getting a job? Yes, it did. An 
Aggie hired me out of A&M by the name of Ned Bruin,

07:01.254 --> 07:06.102
who was with Hughes Tool Company. No interview. 
All he said was, what do you want to work? And I don't

07:12.031 --> 07:28.695
know if it was because he knew my dad or he was a 
member of the class of 45 or he had been exposed to me

07:12.031 --> 07:28.695
when I was a student in some of my leadership roles, 
but I interviewed with several companies and Ned

07:12.031 --> 07:28.695
Bruin finally told me, he says, you're coming to 
work for me.

07:32.641 --> 07:34.023
Qualities of being an Aggie. What is an Aggie? The 
first thing that comes to mind is just a level of

07:38.002 --> 07:44.573
honesty, even when it's not the most flattering.

07:49.401 --> 07:54.610
I have been just impressed my entire life in 
associating with Aggies who No matter what the

07:56.362 --> 08:02.431
situation, honesty is the preeminent 
characteristic that they all display. And that's

08:03.393 --> 08:13.008
an endearing quality, even when it's, as I say, not 
very flattering to the individual or the

08:03.393 --> 08:13.008
situation or to Texas A&M. Just to know that people 
can

08:15.231 --> 08:20.479
be honest. Other qualities? Obviously pride. 
I've talked about that already. Sometimes that's

08:28.117 --> 08:30.379
a dangerous thing. It can get you in trouble when 
you're a little clouded in your emotions of pride

08:30.439 --> 08:37.305
about an institution like A&M. But it's certainly 
a characteristic that I think the outside world

08:38.166 --> 08:43.691
attributes to Texas Aggies. I'd have to say that in 
my experience as executive director now and

08:43.711 --> 08:51.698
traveling around with my peers, the attribute 
that they usually associate with Texas Aggies is

08:53.146 --> 09:22.528
tremendous pride and I think that's a great 
quality to have if you have pride in your school I

08:53.146 --> 09:22.528
bet you got pride in yourself to start with so you 
couple that with the honesty and I think the

08:53.146 --> 09:22.528
integrity and the old you know the Aggie 
philosophy of Aggies don't lie cheat or steal or

08:53.146 --> 09:22.528
tolerate those who do I hope carries on for forever 
do Aggies care much about your ancestry oh yes

08:53.146 --> 09:22.528
indeed And wait, I'm talking about what country 
your ancestors came from. Oh, I don't know about

09:27.834 --> 09:28.917
that. I was thinking more, you know, where you came 
from and so on. I don't know. You know, I really

09:39.957 --> 09:44.021
haven't examined that, Haskell. Actually, I 
think of Aggies as being inclusive in terms of that

09:44.041 --> 09:49.247
doesn't matter. Your dad was rich and mine was 
poor, so what? No, no. That sort of thing.

09:57.355 --> 10:08.867
As you were preparing to leave the campus with your 
degree, what kind of world did you think you were

09:57.355 --> 10:08.867
entering and how well prepared did you feel you 
were because of A&M? You know, I felt more prepared

10:08.932 --> 10:20.907
while I was a student than when I walked across that 
stage with that tube in my hand and sat back down in

10:08.932 --> 10:20.907
my seat and it just hit me. And I said, oh my God, 
what? Now. And you just think of things that A&M

10:26.021 --> 10:29.590
probably didn't prepare you for. Filling out your 
own tax form. Now you graduated in spring?

10:35.242 --> 10:36.204
December of 79. December of 79. Yeah, December of 
79. Michael Halboody was my commencement

10:38.630 --> 10:40.474
speaker. uh describe uh who came and how you how the 
family my mother didn't come is what i remember

10:41.939 --> 11:04.757
most she was ill my father came and and my only aunt 
my father's sister came my sister my oldest sister

10:41.939 --> 11:04.757
and my well both my sisters came and uh a cousin was 
here i just felt a lot of support i'm sad my mother

10:41.939 --> 11:04.757
couldn't be there interesting relative to ed 
cooper who took, I want to say, a very sincere

11:05.362 --> 11:12.471
interest in me during my days at A&M, and I know 
monitored my progress without me knowing it.

11:15.576 --> 11:34.120
He set up a little graduation party at his house for 
me and told me that when I walked across the stage

11:15.576 --> 11:34.120
and he shook my hand and, oh, I can't remember, the 
interim president, Jarvis Miller, handed me my

11:15.576 --> 11:34.120
tube, that my diploma would not be in there. He 
said, don't panic. Your diploma will not be in

11:36.568 --> 11:37.829
there. And I said, OK, but what does that mean? He 
said, well, you'll find out. So that was in G.

11:46.318 --> 11:49.301
Raleigh, Wyne. And I was a little panicked. I was 
worried that maybe something had happened and I

11:51.002 --> 11:54.406
didn't know about it. My whole family was here. And 
we took pictures after the ceremony. We were all

11:58.230 --> 11:59.631
outside having a big time. And then, of course, we 
were supposed to go over to Mr. Cooper's. And I

12:01.633 --> 12:03.735
thought we were just going to go over and have you 
know, a picnic or something. Well, he had a

12:08.497 --> 12:25.048
full-blown meal for family and guests and at an 
appropriate point gathered everybody's

12:08.497 --> 12:25.048
attention and had a nice big tube and he said some 
nice things about me. and said, you know, Porter's

12:25.028 --> 12:36.326
not going to impress anybody with his GPA, but he's 
going to be a success in life because of all that he

12:25.028 --> 12:36.326
represents. Anyway, he just said some nice things 
about me and then proceeded to pull my diploma out

12:36.387 --> 12:44.279
of the tube. And he said, this was hand signed by 
Jarvis Miller, this week, and he said, and now I'm

12:51.185 --> 12:55.633
going to hand sign it in front of all of you. And so 
that meant a lot to me. That meant a lot to me. And

13:00.200 --> 13:03.185
that's one of my real fond memories of A&M. See, now 
I think commencement done the way we do it here is

13:03.326 --> 13:09.396
another one of those key bonding events. Indeed. I 
think it's having a little bit of a metamorphosis

13:10.017 --> 13:22.088
right now, that we've moved to Reed Arena, and it's 
undergoing a bit of an evolution like other big

13:10.017 --> 13:22.088
schools have gone under for years. But we still 
have more of a cohesive atmosphere around

13:22.148 --> 13:28.633
commencement than most schools. See, at 
Missouri, I had great trouble, first of all,

13:29.434 --> 13:35.599
getting the deans to agree that we would have an 
institutional commencement. They wanted to have

13:35.900 --> 13:38.522
their own in their place. And they didn't want to 
call out each name. And only about a third of the

13:43.049 --> 13:46.194
students would even show up. And those who did, 
when they got their diploma, they walked straight

13:47.015 --> 13:52.443
out of the building and their family walked out. So 
it wasn't at all a positive. But if we can keep aware

13:54.546 --> 14:07.125
that everybody goes through, it's like Bonfire or 
anything else, where we're all part of the same

13:54.546 --> 14:07.125
feeling, I think that's very, very important. 
Let's see, and you said you felt quite well

14:07.105 --> 14:12.593
prepared. We're getting ready now to end this. 
What if someone came up to you and gave you a check

14:17.641 --> 14:23.750
for a million dollars with one condition on it? You 
must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you get to decide

14:24.371 --> 14:29.900
how that money would be used. If you could make a 
momentous gift to A&M, for what purpose would you

14:29.980 --> 14:35.408
want it used? Well, the first thing I'd do is make 
sure the Association of Former Students brokered

14:35.945 --> 14:59.252
that gift because this is the only organization 
that I know of that touches 43,000 students, 2,500

14:35.945 --> 14:59.252
faculty and administrators, and does an array of 
so many good things for so many people.

15:01.561 --> 15:15.322
It would be an easy and quick decision to say, do 
what is best for Texas A&M with this money and not

15:01.561 --> 15:15.322
tie it to some selfish interest on my behalf.

15:15.342 --> 15:15.582
Okay. And then a request, if you have any Aggie 
memorabilia letters, papers, journals, at some

15:21.912 --> 15:32.849
point, for goodness sakes, be sure that it is 
preserved either by this organization or by the

15:21.912 --> 15:32.849
A&M Archives. I've preached that sermon to a 
number of people, particularly to a lady whose

15:33.811 --> 15:42.124
husband was an important president here who still 
has them at her house. Oh, gosh, yes. And Ann and

15:43.867 --> 15:46.992
everybody else is trying to persuade Mrs. Rutter 
to And she's not doing it. And people are walking

15:48.714 --> 15:50.515
away with them. She'll hand them. Ann says 
strangers will drive up, sweet-talk Mrs. Rutter,

15:52.957 --> 16:02.966
and they'll walk away with a letter signed by 
MacArthur or a letter signed by Patton. And I'm

16:03.666 --> 16:08.010
saying, oh, oh, oh, how priceless those would be. 
Okay, last question. What feelings do you hold in

16:12.154 --> 16:16.978
your heart for Texas A&M? my vocabulary is just not 
big enough Haskell because of what A&M and I know

16:16.958 --> 16:46.712
you've heard this from countless Aggies you've 
interviewed because of what A&M has done for me

16:16.958 --> 16:46.712
that I'll never be able to repay and in some form or 
fashion service is a lot of my repayment but I just

16:16.958 --> 16:46.712
can't imagine what kind of citizen what kind of 
husband, father, what kind of person I'd be had I

16:47.047 --> 16:52.365
not gone to A&M. Had I made that decision to go to the 
University of Texas or to Texas Tech, I don't

16:59.888 --> 17:03.172
think, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be the person I am 
today. Even though I had a tremendous upbringing

17:03.333 --> 17:23.120
and a foundation for being successful in life by 
virtue of my parents' efforts, A&M put the

17:03.333 --> 17:23.120
finishing touches on me and introduced me to a 
level of pride that I transferred to myself. And I

17:23.721 --> 17:26.625
think that's been the difference in my life. 
That's a good place.
