WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:07.048
Beer cost, but most of the hard liquor was $4. Well, 
it was $3 to $4. The better brands, Sheva's Ribbon

00:09.631 --> 00:11.654
was $4. And that was for, you know, the big bottle. 
And I'm not sure which it was in the fifth or fourth

00:14.998 --> 00:25.392
quart, but even then that was a good price. And he 
hung around the officer's club.

00:31.233 --> 00:38.282
Nobody had a, we didn't really have living rooms. 
The men, the male officers, I think all of those who

00:38.302 --> 00:47.995
just had those living areas had patios or 
something attached. The men had built and made

00:48.015 --> 00:54.083
some sort of a recreation area. The women didn't, 
at least not where I was. Something else that needs

00:59.903 --> 01:01.325
to be said. What I'm saying, what I'm telling are my 
experiences and the way it was at my hospital. The

01:10.979 --> 01:12.421
hospitals were not standard. They were laid out 
differently. The hospital areas were, living

01:14.565 --> 01:21.675
situations were different wherever

01:14.565 --> 01:21.675
you went.

01:25.064 --> 01:36.976
We felt pretty lucky to have women, felt pretty 
lucky to have individual rooms and indoor

01:25.064 --> 01:36.976
vitrines.

01:36.996 --> 01:44.404
We had a hairdresser in the back of our officer's 
club. And really, you know, this was on Longman

01:44.424 --> 01:50.370
Post, which was very large, and there was just all 
kinds of things there. There were two hospitals.

01:51.331 --> 01:52.612
There were all sorts of headquarters. There were a 
lot of Well, there was a WAC detachment not very far

01:53.988 --> 01:58.713
from us. There were a lot of civilian women there, 
Department of the Army civilians. And so, you

02:03.798 --> 02:14.069
know, there was a real need for women's 
facilities.

02:14.089 --> 02:18.173
And it was a Vietnamese man, obviously 
French-trained, If we had any length to our hair at

02:19.216 --> 02:32.173
all, he had us looking like Marie Antoinette, lots 
of big curls, this upswept kind of thing. So we had

02:32.474 --> 02:34.737
our hair done. I was a manicurist. I had nails for 
the first time in my life. She did pedicures. off of

02:47.853 --> 03:00.812
that, you know, when things were slow on the ward 
and

02:47.853 --> 03:00.812
took off my combat boots and had my toenails done in 
addition to the rest of them. But that isn't, you

03:00.832 --> 03:03.416
know, what it was like every place. Not every place 
had a, you know, a rare team attached. So treating

03:08.323 --> 03:16.054
many, you know, respiratory patients was 
difficult in many places.

03:20.523 --> 03:26.909
We had nice big hospital beds throughout most of 
the hospital. And it wasn't true when I got there,

03:26.929 --> 03:32.715
but we eventually got them. And they didn't have 
running water on the wards when I got there, but

03:32.915 --> 03:41.063
they were in the process of putting it in. So we had 
hot and cold running water very soon. And had

03:46.227 --> 03:48.910
showers on them. on the wards for the patients.

03:57.203 --> 04:01.891
We soon had air conditioning. I heard tales about 
how miserable it was before air conditioning,

04:01.911 --> 04:14.492
especially for the guys in full body casts or half 
body casts.

04:17.442 --> 04:20.104
So they had gone for some time without that. The 
women's quarters were eventually updated.

04:26.390 --> 04:37.139
Everybody got a ceiling and the whole, you know, 
each hooch was air-conditioned, central

04:26.390 --> 04:37.139
air-conditioned. So things were different. It 
just depended on where you were and when you were.

04:44.625 --> 04:46.707
And were you involved with the MedCap program? I 
never went out. I knew about him. I was afraid to put

04:50.539 --> 04:56.348
myself in danger. And it wasn't just that I 
physically was afraid. I don't remember shaking

04:59.373 --> 05:01.776
my boots thinking about it. But my parents were... 
I didn't... Well, I knew they would not take

05:04.260 --> 05:13.714
something happening to me very well. And my 
brother at the time was 1A. Now he eventually got

05:15.965 --> 05:23.234
that changed, but he was flunking out of school and 
lost his deferment. And then the other thing was I

05:23.254 --> 05:29.262
lost a boyfriend over there just before I went. So I 
was very much aware of what a family went through. I

05:34.488 --> 05:45.482
went from his wake, from the funeral home, to the 
airplane in St. Louis that would take me out to the

05:34.488 --> 05:45.482
West Coast.

05:51.301 --> 05:53.483
report call was such that I had to leave. I couldn't 
stay until the next day. So I didn't go to his

05:57.327 --> 06:03.833
funeral.

06:03.853 --> 06:08.057
But I was afraid to get out, you know, in the 
countryside. I didn't like the idea, I told you, of

06:08.077 --> 06:14.363
flying up anywhere by chopper or going over land. I 
knew it was dangerous. Did many civilians come to

06:17.946 --> 06:20.869
the base? They had a lot of Vietnamese workers. 
Everybody worked in our laundry, in our kitchen.

06:33.856 --> 06:35.698
There were a few people who worked on the wards. 
There was a translator or two, probably more.

06:42.785 --> 06:48.291
There were stretcher bearers assigned to the 
emergency room.

06:50.127 --> 06:54.613
That was just our hospital.

06:54.633 --> 06:55.554
Over the whole post. One of the first things I 
remember about being in country, got in there at

06:55.574 --> 07:09.652
nighttime, but I think it was when I was bused from 
the replacement center, which was at Benoit,

06:55.574 --> 07:09.652
which was just adjacent to Long Bend Post. From 
there over to the hospital. I remember turning a

07:13.857 --> 07:16.000
corner and noticing these people stooped over 
working on the ditches and pouring concrete and

07:16.672 --> 07:23.142
all this stuff. And then looking again and 
realizing it was women.

07:30.174 --> 07:32.677
There weren't any men to do that work. It was women. 
They were down to women. What were your feelings

07:36.824 --> 07:38.567
about the Vietnamese people? They changed over 
time.

07:46.878 --> 08:07.418
I'm always unsettled when I can't speak to 
somebody and we used a few words over and over and

07:46.878 --> 08:07.418
over to get things across.

08:07.438 --> 08:15.666
It was frustrating trying to work with them 
because they didn't understand. Now what And

08:17.084 --> 08:25.414
later on, as my tour continued and ended, I found 
myself thinking of them and even calling them

08:17.084 --> 08:25.414
goofs. And I felt bad at the time.

08:30.479 --> 08:34.244
I felt worse later.

08:34.264 --> 08:45.977
I think it was... You know, it's hard to translate 
at the time and remember what's going on and what

08:34.264 --> 08:45.977
has gone on in their lives, or even to know, really, 
what they've been through. So many of them, so

08:46.987 --> 09:04.256
often when we took patients on recovery, on pre-op 
rather, when they came in, when one of the

08:46.987 --> 09:04.256
Vietnamese came in as a casualty, they often came 
in with two or three family members. And they were a

09:05.959 --> 09:07.541
bother. We had to remember to order meal trays for 
them, which they didn't like. We didn't usually

09:13.514 --> 09:19.483
have meal trays on the pre-op recovery.

09:19.503 --> 09:26.132
They, you know, they were in the way.

09:26.152 --> 09:35.586
They struck you as not

09:26.152 --> 09:35.586
being very bright.

09:35.606 --> 09:36.607
That wasn't it at all. They couldn't understand 
you. They were numbed by what had gone on. They were

09:43.265 --> 09:51.416
there with their family member because maybe they 
wouldn't see him again.

09:51.436 --> 09:53.398
There wasn't much attempt. I mean, we picked up 
Vietnamese casualties, civilian casualties, as

09:53.478 --> 09:59.186
we could. I don't know how often or how much of the 
time they went out of their way to bring in civilian

10:00.487 --> 10:13.204
casualties, but we got a good number of them.

10:15.462 --> 10:22.492
But you always had the time element and the 
communication factor. And patients, we often did

10:22.512 --> 10:27.740
the emergency surgery for them. And then the next 
day or the day after, they would be sent to a

10:27.880 --> 10:34.049
provincial hospital over in Benoit. And then you 
just wondered where they ever did end up. And if

10:41.200 --> 10:44.625
those people being picked up 30 miles away and 
brought into Long Bend, had any idea where Long

10:45.044 --> 10:51.252
Bend was or if they were ever told. So they had to 
come along. And then they were, you know,

10:53.855 --> 11:02.766
certainly further, I think, abused just by the 
whole system.

11:05.690 --> 11:11.357
Big people, I mean, we are big compared to those 
people. And, you know, we... maybe and maybe not

11:15.250 --> 11:29.570
looked kindly at them.

11:29.590 --> 11:40.144
Later on, when I was on a different ward, a medical 
ward, we still had Vietnamese patients there. We

11:40.630 --> 11:41.791
got closer to them. There was more of a rapport. I 
remember thinking of them more as people

11:44.094 --> 11:55.248
than I did the ones we took care of on pre-op and 
recovery. There was a lot of shuffling of people.

12:00.394 --> 12:04.579
But when we had them for a length of time, And under 
circumstances that were a lot more normal, we

12:05.723 --> 12:11.510
weren't dealing with smashed people. But on the 
medical ward, I certainly found it easier to feel

12:11.530 --> 12:22.824
more humanely toward them. We had a little girl, 
four or five, who had a tracheostomy that had been

12:22.844 --> 12:31.354
put in by a French doctor. Her grandmother did 
speak French, and she was with her. cute little

12:35.812 --> 12:36.933
thing. It really was a doll, just easy to love, love 
back.

12:43.500 --> 12:50.268
This thing had been done, oh, the wrong kind of a 
tube had been put in. It was a closed-in tube. And

12:52.930 --> 13:01.039
she, you know, usually, she couldn't get rid of the 
mucus in her lungs very easily, and she developed

12:52.930 --> 13:01.039
pneumonia, and that's when we got her. And there 
was an attempt made to to revise that to see what was

13:04.904 --> 13:12.113
wrong with her, why she needed the tracheostomy. 
We couldn't get a real good story. And it turned out

13:15.437 --> 13:25.749
there was some sort of a tumor, a benign kind of 
tumor, but it would continue to grow and occlude

13:15.437 --> 13:25.749
her airway. And she would always have to have the 
tracheostomy. So there was that attempt to... not

13:34.132 --> 13:40.121
just take care of her, but do something better for 
her. And for a while, she needed an oxygen tent, and

13:40.141 --> 13:47.393
we didn't have such a thing. And so the corpsman 
rigged one up, and it was the most gosh-awful

13:47.413 --> 13:52.721
looking thing you've ever seen. They had her in a 
big baby bed, kind of a bed, and had rigged There was

14:02.583 --> 14:03.984
clear plastic. They had clear plastic all around 
her. But to get the steam, they had just this series

14:06.387 --> 14:11.853
of stuff, you know, bottles and tubes and all this. 
And it made a lot of noise. But it worked. And, you

14:16.618 --> 14:21.623
know, the guys were tickled to do that and to be 
around her. And they liked her mama's song, too.

14:23.425 --> 14:30.933
Grandma was very pleasant company.

14:31.033 --> 14:32.134
And there were others. you know, that made a mark on 
us. And that I hope we made a mark on more so than

14:37.536 --> 14:54.456
places where we put people to die, you know, back

14:37.536 --> 14:54.456
in the corner and left them, you know. And how did 
your peers act towards the Vietnamese?

15:00.984 --> 15:02.526
There were some who... you know, who were really 
fine toward them, and others who weren't.

15:10.390 --> 15:16.296
I came away, well, I went thinking I wasn't 
prejudiced. I had not grown up around any ethnic

15:16.316 --> 15:32.293
minority, and

15:16.316 --> 15:32.293
had encountered blacks in St. Louis when I was in 
school. And it was nothing but a positive

15:33.691 --> 15:36.876
experience. I wasn't buddy-buddy friends with

15:37.777 --> 15:46.370
any black person. But later on, I think I 
understood how easily you can become prejudiced

15:46.390 --> 16:03.175
and biased, and that you can read things into a 
person's behavior, certainly read it wrong, and

16:03.425 --> 16:05.368
judge them very badly. You really do need to know 
why they have this dull, dumb look on their faces.

16:15.844 --> 16:16.746
There's a real reason. If I'd gone through the kind 
of trauma they'd gone through, I'd have a dull

16:17.106 --> 16:21.934
look, too. Probably chronically depressed. 
These are people who have grown up for

16:24.518 --> 16:29.145
generations.

16:29.969 --> 16:33.696
in warfare, just trying to eke out a living and stay 
alive no matter how. And

16:34.257 --> 16:45.857
there was not a lot of high-minded niceness in 
them. Or it, you know, it hadn't been there for a

16:45.877 --> 16:52.990
while, or they didn't have many opportunities for 
it to show.

16:55.990 --> 17:02.757
And did you take any kind of precautions against 
BC, or was it not a big threat? It was not a big threat

17:03.738 --> 17:07.121
on Long Bend. On the hospital grounds, all the 
buildings were bunkered outside with barrels

17:07.141 --> 17:19.794
that were filled with something, dirt or rocks or 
something. And then on top of the barrels would be

17:19.814 --> 17:25.660
two or three layers of sandbags. There had been 
some true bunkers dug into the ground and then

17:28.164 --> 17:38.921
bunkered over areas like

17:28.164 --> 17:38.921
tornado shelters. But they were out back behind, 
you'd have to walk a distance to get to them. It's

17:48.877 --> 17:50.802
like being in a tornado. You want to get yourself 
down and flat and out of the open area as soon as

17:50.842 --> 17:57.497
possible. So to go from a building to a bunker, you 
could be hurt on the way. So they felt it was best

18:03.832 --> 18:05.957
to... and just bunker the buildings. And what we 
were to do in the case of alerts, we were to get down

18:08.031 --> 18:13.779
on the ground. In our rooms, we were to get under the 
beds, put our steel pots on, get under the beds. And

18:20.047 --> 18:31.262
on the wards,

18:20.047 --> 18:31.262
we were to get our patients on the floor and then put 
their mattress on top of them. And they'd have the

18:31.282 --> 18:33.565
steel frame of the bed over that.

18:38.978 --> 18:53.981
We

18:38.978 --> 18:53.981
had some incoming shells we were fired on a few 
times, and I was really only aware of it one time. I

18:55.223 --> 18:57.026
slept through a lot. And then I think our 
particular compound, this place was so big, the

18:57.046 --> 19:07.602
whole post wouldn't be hit at the same time. And I 
didn't know it until much later, but our hospital

19:07.970 --> 19:18.488
was fairly close to the ammo dump, a big ammo dump 
that served probably a huge area. And there were

19:18.508 --> 19:24.999
twin towers, radio towers or something, not far 
away. And the story was that the BC used those

19:25.039 --> 19:31.750
towers to sight in on the ammo dump. which wasn't 
that far from us. So I think we're in more potential

19:34.087 --> 19:38.732
danger than a lot of us realized. And then I found 
out later, after I left, sometime in the next six

19:39.533 --> 19:48.382
months, some of our buildings were hit and 
damaged.

19:52.666 --> 20:01.315
The one time that I was aware that I'd gone to bed 
fairly early, it was a time when things were going

19:52.666 --> 20:01.315
on in our... Officer's Club had been told to close 
down early. And I'd had plenty to drink. I was...

20:08.267 --> 20:15.535
Well, I was still awake and functioning because I 
went home. I showered and rolled up my hair before

20:15.615 --> 20:20.520
going to bed. And then I was awakened around 
midnight, and the gal trying to wake me up had a hard

20:20.540 --> 20:28.047
time, and my door was locked. She couldn't come in 
and get me. So I finally did get up, And I was groggy.

20:33.479 --> 20:36.385
I kind of knew what was going on, but not really. And 
I put my steel pot on, and it wouldn't fit over my

20:37.026 --> 20:42.496
hair rollers. That worried me a little bit. I laid 
down in the corner. I couldn't get under my bed,

20:46.263 --> 20:50.691
either, with all this on my hair. I didn't have the 
presence of mind to take my rollers out. So I just

20:57.984 --> 21:03.591
got down in the corner on the floor, in the corner 
formed by my bed, and I had a refrigerator. And I

21:04.752 --> 21:09.758
sort of set the helmet over my head. And then I did 
worry because I worried, but I didn't do anything

21:10.699 --> 21:15.664
about it. I had a big oscillating fan. on top of the 
refrigerator. It was one of those things with a big

21:19.722 --> 21:24.568
wide open spring. Big enough you could just put 
your whole hand into it. And

21:26.630 --> 21:39.624
I did think, I hope nothing hits too close to us 
because if it does it will knock that fan down on top

21:26.630 --> 21:39.624
of me and chew me up. But I didn't do anything. The 
next morning I had to work and I had a headache. I

21:48.637 --> 21:52.516
didn't often drink to the point I had a hangover. 
That was unusual for me. But I had a hangover that

21:54.593 --> 21:59.300
day, and I felt bad, and my head hurt. And I went to 
work, and the ward was a mess. It was just an

22:02.124 --> 22:07.912
absolute mess, because they had all gone on red 
alert also, and the patients were on the floor. And

22:08.553 --> 22:11.256
usually, everyone wakes up around 5. They turn the 
lights on on the ward at 5 and start taking

22:11.296 --> 22:23.233
temperatures and vital signs and making guys get 
up and shower and make their beds and all this

22:11.296 --> 22:23.233
stuff. But I guess the night had been so crazy that 
no one was waking up on time. And so they were just

22:27.806 --> 22:36.359
getting up, and there was a little nest under the 
nurse's station desk where the nurse had fallen

22:27.806 --> 22:36.359
asleep. And things were just messy, and they were 
trying to be organized and so on. And a fellow came

22:45.472 --> 22:49.618
in on the ward, came onto the ward that I knew. He was 
a guy I had known in El Paso before I'd been Station

22:53.538 --> 22:55.920
in Vietnam. And I'd seen him a few times. He was over 
there with a team that was testing a new, field

22:58.203 --> 23:05.029
testing a new weapon. It was a Vulcan. It's called a 
Vulcan. It's a Gatling gun, and it had been mounted

23:06.871 --> 23:15.440
on an Army personnel carrier, an APC. They hadn't 
been done before, so they were trying it out. And I

23:18.803 --> 23:22.667
had seen some other guys, from that team just about 
once. One of them I had known in El Paso, too. And

23:29.502 --> 23:36.292
Jimmy came over to tell me that one of these guys had 
been killed that night. And not very far from the

23:36.312 --> 23:49.752
hospital, there was a

23:36.312 --> 23:49.752
BOQ, an officer's quarters area, just two or three 
blocks from our compound. And that's where they

23:50.575 --> 23:54.620
stayed when they came on to post. And this fellow 
had stood outside, outside the bunker. They did

23:58.205 --> 24:00.388
have a bunker. Watching all the, you know, the 
firefights, the lights and everything going on.

24:05.334 --> 24:11.342
And he was killed by a shell fragment and it just 
went into his chest and took him immediately. Just

24:11.362 --> 24:13.665
instantly. And, you know, I felt very bad. I knew he 
had a wife and a couple of kids at home. And young,

24:19.887 --> 24:25.413
nice guy. And do you know my headache left? The 
hangover was gone.

24:39.869 --> 24:47.818
I wouldn't have thought, I didn't expect the 
psychological effects of a hangover to be, you

24:39.869 --> 24:47.818
know, to override the physical effects. Okay.

24:59.637 --> 25:07.048
Were you aware of any relationships among 
Vietnamese men and American

24:59.637 --> 25:07.048
women? No. No, that's a mix I didn't hear about. 
Okay. And was racism a problem? Once in a while you

25:18.207 --> 25:20.490
were aware of it.

25:24.754 --> 25:36.928
There were a few of the black enlisted men who wore 
chains with black clenched fists on them.

25:40.292 --> 25:47.860
We had one fellow, a lot of the wards did this, ours I 
don't think as much as some others. But they would

25:48.127 --> 25:50.730
hang flags from people's home states. They had a 
big expanse of ceiling in these Quonset huts. And a

25:59.121 --> 26:03.907
lot of people would bring their home flag. And one 
of our doctors had brought the rebel flag, the

26:03.927 --> 26:08.552
Confederate battle flag. And it was hanging right 
across from where we had put this fellow in bed. He

26:14.319 --> 26:16.362
was a black fellow.

26:19.160 --> 26:22.043
And he was very upset about that. And he was kind of 
loud about being upset. And, you know, you just had

26:25.427 --> 26:29.931
the feeling, uh-oh, troublemaker. And we moved 
him to the other ward. The medical ward was two

26:35.597 --> 26:37.739
wards. And we just moved him around to the other 
side. I think we did take the flag down, too. I don't

26:44.422 --> 26:49.951
remember whether we took it down before we moved 
him or not, but I know that black did go down. And he

26:51.974 --> 26:55.239
was a model patient. He was fine. But the fellas, 
you know, they were aware of it. Another thing, one

27:00.527 --> 27:09.521
of my corpsmen

27:00.527 --> 27:09.521
was a black fellow, young. This kid, I never knew 
how much I could believe. He was real charming and

27:12.586 --> 27:18.573
personable and would just tell the wildest 
stories. And he claimed he was only 17 when he came

27:19.414 --> 27:22.698
into Vietnam. And it was hard, you know, it's hard 
to tell a young kid that age, you know, when he's 17

27:22.718 --> 27:26.382
to 19. You might,

27:26.402 --> 27:35.072
you know, tell younger, but you can't really tell. 
And he told amazing stories about what he had done

27:35.273 --> 27:42.441
before he had come to Vietnam. He'd grown up on the 
streets in New Jersey, and he was a tough guy. Or

27:47.245 --> 27:50.228
he'd have you believe he was. And he came to us as a 
corpsman after having been in the boonies as an

27:50.248 --> 28:04.385
infantryman for several months, probably six 
months. And he told me... He just couldn't stand it

28:07.042 --> 28:08.644
any longer. He couldn't stand the killing any 
longer, and he begged and begged, and

28:08.664 --> 28:25.980
occasionally this did happen, that fellows were 
rotated, you know, people who had no prior medical

28:08.664 --> 28:25.980
training were rotated into the hospitals, and 
they got OJT as corpsmen, as medical corpsmen. And

28:26.201 --> 28:35.850
he told that

28:26.201 --> 28:35.850
there was that There were racial problems out in 
the field. And he said that the Vietnamese, that

28:40.763 --> 28:51.341
they had a choice of firing on brothers or white 
guys or a group that had a lot of white guys. They

28:51.601 --> 28:55.468
picked the white guys rather than firing on the 
brothers. And seemed to say that there was, you

28:55.488 --> 29:01.939
know, an understanding there. I never heard it 
from anyone else. And as I say, this guy, you know,

29:05.021 --> 29:12.470
well, you know, he had given me cause to doubt his 
truthfulness at times. That was hard because he

29:14.072 --> 29:16.235
was, you know, he was a fun, sweet kid. But, you 
know, I just don't

29:17.056 --> 29:23.303
know. And was sexism a problem?

29:31.794 --> 29:32.635
Well, yes and no. uh, sexism as it, uh, there was a 
lot going on then. I wasn't aware of the women's

29:39.642 --> 29:44.308
movement, was not involved with it or think it. I 
needed to be a part of it for a long time because I was

29:44.888 --> 29:49.914
just being very selfish. I was, uh, a woman, uh, uh, 
army officer. I was a nurse. And being in the Army

29:56.642 --> 30:00.647
Nurse Corps is a lot different from being in the 
Women's Army Corps, the WACs. No wax now. There's

30:03.463 --> 30:07.369
no women's army corps. But it was special being a 
woman in the nurse corps. And we were treated with a

30:14.399 --> 30:20.247
great deal of respect and courtesy.

30:23.511 --> 30:30.921
This was all, I think, well much of it was true, much 
of it was just on the surface. There was resentment

30:33.112 --> 30:38.938
among male nurses toward female nurses. At that 
time, male nurses had not been officers long

30:39.019 --> 30:54.656
enough to have gained any superiority

30:39.019 --> 30:54.656
in rank. I knew a couple of majors, and I believe one 
became a lieutenant colonel when I was there. A

30:59.982 --> 31:02.865
lieutenant colonel was about as high as men were at 
the time. So there was hard feelings there.

31:12.941 --> 31:17.866
I think we enjoyed the privileges we had.

31:18.847 --> 31:22.231
For the most part, we really enjoyed them. The guys 
were eager to do things for us.

31:29.058 --> 31:32.481
There were a lot who wanted something in return. 
One of the things, and I don't think this was done

31:33.254 --> 31:52.165
consciously, but

31:33.254 --> 31:52.165
when the guys had a chance to be around one of us, 
they opened up. They spilled their guts. They just

31:53.146 --> 31:55.530
told us everything. They confided in us. It was 
mother confessed her. It was sister. It was... you

32:00.119 --> 32:06.751
know, girlfriend, all rode in to one.

32:06.771 --> 32:09.896
They didn't do that to me. Going over, this was a 
23-hour flight with two stops.

32:19.774 --> 32:24.422
I had managed to miss my port call through not 
knowing just how long it was going to take to get

32:25.313 --> 32:32.882
from San Francisco Airport out to Travis and how I 
had to get there and so on. There was no direct bus,

32:32.902 --> 32:35.845
surprisingly. And so I missed it by about 20 
minutes. And so I spent about two and a half days at

32:38.929 --> 32:45.537
Travis Airport Space waiting to go over. And when I 
did, I was the only woman on the plane and the only

32:46.418 --> 32:54.207
officer on the plane. Well, being the only officer 
didn't count because I was a nurse. And nurses were

32:58.595 --> 32:59.957
not to command. We were never to be in command 
situations, even if we were the only officer. But I

33:06.302 --> 33:08.805
was really the senior person. There were nine 
NCOs.

33:17.013 --> 33:17.813
They were all young. The oldest one was under 30. I 
was 23. And he had just made Sergeant First Class,

33:26.182 --> 33:40.824
and no experience as, you know, Sergeant First 
Class in any big situation. And in the course of

33:40.844 --> 33:54.484
that flight, we were put in the front of the plane 
that was partitioned off from the back, and the

33:40.844 --> 33:54.484
front had about ten seats in it. It would be like the 
first class section, except it was not first

33:54.987 --> 34:01.275
class. We were just as packed as the guys in the 
back. We were just separated. And so I was put up

34:05.420 --> 34:06.702
there with them. And during that trip, every 
single one of those guys sat with me sometime or

34:07.663 --> 34:13.650
other. They just played musical chairs.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.839
And I heard every guy's story. Every single one.

34:26.847 --> 34:38.902
And the senior NCO was real nervous about being 
senior and worried about just everything. He was

34:38.962 --> 34:42.266
very open about it, talked a lot about his wife and 
so on. Well, the tradition was, or the practice

34:43.067 --> 34:55.842
was, as much as possible, when you got to Hawaii, 
you got off and got a bottle. if at all possible. And

34:57.819 --> 35:03.827
he had talked to guys and, you know, somebody knew 
how to do this and still get back on the plane. Now,

35:03.847 --> 35:08.514
we all got off the plane and had the opportunity to 
go into the bar. But, you know, the deal was to get a

35:09.475 --> 35:13.821
bottle and bring it back on. And so he told me how he 
planned to do this and so on. And I was included in

35:18.267 --> 35:25.457
it, you know, so that when he did get on and he got 
back with just minutes to spare, it wasn't a matter

35:18.267 --> 35:25.457
of going into... you know, the airport gift shop. 
You had to get a cab and go into town or go along the

35:29.256 --> 35:33.762
strip, you know, several miles away. And we were 
only on the ground for about two hours. He got there

35:37.848 --> 35:41.314
just in the nick of time. And then I hid the bottle 
behind me because, you know, would you do this?

35:48.745 --> 35:51.409
Because the stewardess would never suspect you. 
And so then we just, you know, passed little drinks

35:52.550 --> 35:55.815
around and nobody... Nobody, I don't think, 
wanted to at that point. It was just something they

35:59.788 --> 36:01.210
had to do. They had to go through this ritual of 
securing the bottle. But it was funny how they all

36:06.497 --> 36:10.623
just bounced around, you know.

36:15.149 --> 36:17.212
But that got to be old hat after a while. And, you 
know, we came to resent it, you know, at some point

36:17.392 --> 36:24.182
or another. I caused a fight in an officer's club 
one night because of it. I went in and had some

36:28.617 --> 36:35.044
sewing or mending, something to do, and didn't 
want to do it in my room. I did not want to be alone. I

36:36.145 --> 36:44.754
didn't want to interact with anybody, but I wanted 
people around, and that was all we had as a living

36:36.145 --> 36:44.754
room place to go. And this character would not 
leave me alone. He'd had too much, and he was kind of

36:47.276 --> 36:53.663
weaving a bit, and eventually somebody came over 
and stepped in, but He was loud, and it almost came

36:54.757 --> 36:58.581
to fisticuffs between these two.

37:02.345 --> 37:05.748
And how did the doctors treat you? We were treated 
well. They wanted people who could do their job

37:07.790 --> 37:12.575
around them. They wanted well-trained nurses. 
And if that's what you were, they treated you very

37:16.499 --> 37:20.743
well. And if you weren't... Then you were treated 
that way. You

37:24.079 --> 37:27.584
were just kind of... I had a young nurse on the 
medical ward who was very young and very immature.

37:34.773 --> 37:38.938
And just kind of seemed to be in la-la land, you 
know. And she did what she was told. For the most

37:42.763 --> 37:47.028
part, she reported what she needed to report. But 
she was just not grown up. And that's the way she was

37:50.252 --> 37:52.455
treated.

37:56.688 --> 37:58.750
How did you feel when you came home?

38:03.635 --> 38:10.022
Well, I was suffering culture shock without 
really naming it. I wanted to leave. I was really

38:11.564 --> 38:16.069
eager to leave. I got here and I wanted to go back. I 
didn't want to stay. There was nothing here for me.

38:24.278 --> 38:27.001
I didn't really want to talk about what I'd been 
through. I would have answered questions. And for

38:31.645 --> 38:33.887
the most part, people didn't ask.

38:36.530 --> 38:42.135
And I didn't want to bring them up. I went to work in a 
civilian hospital in New Orleans. And I didn't

38:47.640 --> 38:52.345
realize at the time, but New Orleans was really way 
It was really in the dark ages as far as nursing was

38:53.202 --> 39:00.590
concerned.

39:00.610 --> 39:06.196
The chief nurses were running around in starched 
uniforms. I hadn't seen uniforms that starched

39:06.356 --> 39:11.061
even in college. Only one of the nurses in the 
nursing service office had even a bachelor's

39:11.081 --> 39:22.973
degree. Her bachelor's was in education. So these 
were just diploma trained nurses, you know,

39:26.516 --> 39:34.829
senior of course, and very much concerned with 
keeping things the way they were. They were just

39:35.410 --> 39:39.376
beginning to do team nursing. It's what they 
called team nursing, but it was not team nursing,

39:39.857 --> 39:47.509
and that was really the being in thing at the time. 
Team nursing was fun. I was looking forward to

39:49.316 --> 39:52.679
doing that again, because we had not done it in the 
Army. We weren't staffed on each ward enough to do

39:52.699 --> 39:56.944
it. And

39:56.964 --> 40:12.401
there were, as I was being oriented at that 
hospital, three black women nurses were pointed

39:56.964 --> 40:12.401
out to me. And they were all very recent graduates. 
They were just, you know, that year's crop. from a

40:17.257 --> 40:21.524
local black university. Is it Dillard or is it 
Howard? I don't know. But there's a large black

40:25.470 --> 40:31.439
university in New Orleans. And they were 
graduating with a degree, Bachelor of Science

40:31.459 --> 40:37.808
degree, nurses. And this was the first time any of 
them had been hired by this hospital. Boy, were

40:43.076 --> 40:44.158
they watching them. And so far, they're turning 
out just fine. But it was, you know, they didn't

40:49.348 --> 40:55.414
expect them to, and they didn't want them to. I 
mean, that's where I really encountered racism.

41:01.721 --> 41:10.069
You know, what was very blatant.

41:10.089 --> 41:10.770
Coming home. When I went to work there, I worked in a 
recovery room. And a couple or three times I said

41:19.210 --> 41:25.318
something about, oh, you know the way we did this in 
Vietnam. They were not interested.

41:32.086 --> 41:35.771
You know, I would have thought, I would have been 
interested in that. We had to... We had a very

41:38.020 --> 41:45.371
peculiar way of giving, or I thought it was 
peculiar, way of giving packed red cells to

41:38.020 --> 41:45.371
patients. We had no centrifuge, so there was no way 
of spinning down a unit of blood.

42:03.057 --> 42:06.542
They would just set the unit out to settle. And then 
you'd send your most sure-footed corpsman over to

42:07.332 --> 42:14.141
the lab to get it, and you'd very, very carefully 
hang it. You know, you had to stick your tubing in

42:14.241 --> 42:17.625
and not jostle this. We did have plastic bags. It 
was plastic bags that the blood was in. And then you

42:23.233 --> 42:24.995
had to be careful watching it. I mean, you know, 
watch it carefully as it went in. Make sure you got

42:27.097 --> 42:30.302
it or you stopped it when the red cells were in. And, 
you know, it's not a problem. Great story, but I

42:35.412 --> 42:40.159
mean, you know, it fits a battle situation. And 
you'd think people would, you know, be polite at

42:41.461 --> 42:49.833
least to you as you told the story, and, you know, 
they weren't. They didn't want to hear it.

42:54.300 --> 43:03.293
We had to hold on to patients longer than we should 
have at times because of the... medevac

43:04.471 --> 43:06.013
procedures. The Air Force did the air back. It was 
their planes, their personnel, their nurses and

43:09.777 --> 43:20.190
everything who carried patients out of country, 
well even up country, like to the in-country

43:09.777 --> 43:20.190
convalescent center at Cameron Bay. So the Air 
Force wrote the rules and these were, you know, big

43:21.872 --> 43:31.423
airliners pressurized to like

43:33.496 --> 43:34.999
you know, our passenger airplanes are. And even 
pressurized at altitude, they are still

43:35.981 --> 43:44.356
pressurized only to about 6,000 feet. You know, 
you get somebody who is anemic, has a heart

43:46.039 --> 43:54.214
condition or whatever, and take them up to Denver, 
and they can get into trouble. That's 5,000 feet.

43:56.497 --> 43:58.959
So the patients did have to be stable. They had to 
have a certain red blood count before the Air Force

43:59.220 --> 44:05.546
would let them on the plane. On the medical ward, we 
got a lot of patients who had hemolytic anemia.

44:14.014 --> 44:16.436
And they were very depleted. Well, most of the 
patients like that were Vietnamese or

44:16.476 --> 44:24.023
Thai. There was only one airbag flight to Bangkok a 
week. So if you didn't get your Thai patient on the

44:33.833 --> 44:39.298
plane on Monday, you had him until next Monday. And 
again, it was a matter of, and these people, by the

44:40.780 --> 44:49.548
time they were ready for airbag home, were not 
feeling too bad. They would have gotten up and left

44:49.588 --> 44:54.853
if they could have gotten away with it. They hated 
our food. They didn't understand our bathroom

45:00.133 --> 45:03.217
facilities. They couldn't communicate with us. I 
don't remember any word out of Thai that I learned,

45:05.439 --> 45:09.505
any Thai word that I learned. I did learn, you know, 
a few Vietnamese words and phrases, but I don't

45:09.605 --> 45:15.432
remember any Thai. And we came to, oh, we couldn't 
stand the Thai patients. The other thing about the

45:19.842 --> 45:24.791
Thais was they would be visited by great numbers of 
their friends. And always before coming in to

45:26.034 --> 45:31.785
visit a friend, they would stop at RPX and buy out 
the place. What a greedy, selfish lot. But anyway,

45:39.039 --> 45:42.846
a little thing like not having enough red blood 
cells, you know, we'd keep one of those guys with us

45:43.012 --> 45:48.418
for another week. So it was important to, you know, 
we would give them a transfusion the night before.

45:54.525 --> 45:58.329
And again, you know, nobody was interested in that 
story. So I soon learned not to talk about it. And,

46:04.796 --> 46:05.357
uh, And looking back, you know, I should have been 
talking about it. I should have been talking about

46:10.380 --> 46:12.323
it to my family. I should have somehow let them know 
that it was all right to ask me questions.

46:23.461 --> 46:27.929
I remember at Christmas, you know, really, not at 
Christmas, but holidays as they came out. New

46:28.289 --> 46:30.252
Year's certainly had been fun over there. And, you 
know, I wasn't stepping into it. any sort of a

46:35.003 --> 46:39.169
circle of friends back home that was going to party 
on New Year's.

46:42.774 --> 46:46.320
It was just complete culture shock. And I went, you 
know, back into civilian nursing, and that made it

46:46.340 --> 46:50.606
worse. And the particular kind of civilian 
nursing, it was not. The Army has a very high level

46:53.991 --> 46:56.274
of nursing. I didn't appreciate that at the time 
until I got out, but it really does. High

47:00.681 --> 47:04.386
educational standards, and... You know, I was 
going to the Dark Ages, plus the prejudice. And the

47:12.602 --> 47:21.015
other thing that had gone on just shortly before I 
came home, the whole Milo scandal broke. And even

47:23.038 --> 47:34.255
though I had nothing to do with that, was not even in 
the area where the Americal Division operated,

47:23.038 --> 47:34.255
wasn't part of any of that, I was part of the Army.
