00:02.663 --> 00:07.749
I told you earlier that I lived at home and I worked at home.

00:07.909 --> 00:16.718
I milked a bunch of cows and loaded up the milk, took it into the creamery at Stephenville, and I heard the news when I got into town that morning.

00:17.419 --> 00:20.562
Somebody said, hey, did you hear what happened at Pearl Harbor?

00:20.703 --> 00:21.764
You know, and I hadn't heard it.

00:22.464 --> 00:24.026
I don't know why we didn't.

00:24.767 --> 00:27.210
No one turned the old radio on, I guess.

00:28.231 --> 00:32.215
Did it dawn on you what that might mean to your life?

00:32.752 --> 00:33.393
Yes, it did.

00:34.455 --> 00:39.265
Where were you when you heard that President Roosevelt had died?

00:39.285 --> 00:44.696
I was on my way back home from Southwest Pacific.

00:44.716 --> 00:47.703
Or maybe, I believe I was.

00:47.823 --> 00:51.270
I believe I was on a troop ship.

00:51.951 --> 00:52.853
Or maybe, yeah.

00:54.689 --> 00:57.453
Or maybe that was just before I got on the troop ship.

00:57.473 --> 00:59.437
But I was still in the Pacific, somewhere.

00:59.457 --> 01:03.463
Where were you when you heard that the Japanese had surrendered?

01:03.643 --> 01:05.406
I was in Ellington Field.

01:06.428 --> 01:08.511
That was on the 14th of August.

01:08.952 --> 01:10.154
What did you and your buddies do?

01:12.197 --> 01:15.543
Well, I don't recall.

01:15.583 --> 01:22.013
There were so many of us out there on the base.

01:22.634 --> 01:29.421
and so little places to go to get drunk that I didn't.

01:30.062 --> 01:31.343
I can remember.

01:31.384 --> 01:37.470
The thing that I do remember most anything is, what does this mean now?

01:38.852 --> 01:40.734
Am I going to get out of here?

01:41.615 --> 01:46.760
In my case, I thought, am I actually going to get out of here in time to start veterinary school this fall?

01:47.681 --> 01:51.105
I didn't really think I would.

01:51.558 --> 01:55.924
kept coming to us that the muster outlines were going to be long.

01:56.746 --> 02:06.119
And it would have been because the very first few people that got out had to go to Fort Sam, San Antonio, to be discharged.

02:06.139 --> 02:13.510
And then pretty soon they moved the discharge to the big bases like at Ellison.

02:13.530 --> 02:20.620
And you came to A&M that fall and took that heavy load that first semester and got rid of that chemistry course.

02:21.578 --> 02:29.650
Did you, and you, when you got that first test back, you said you were worried about whether or not you'd passed it.

02:29.910 --> 02:30.351
Yeah.

02:30.371 --> 02:36.881
Were there any other moments when you paused and wondered if veterinary medicine was right for you?

02:37.802 --> 02:38.864
I don't recall any.

02:39.465 --> 02:40.066
So that you?

02:40.847 --> 02:42.970
I figured the system out.

02:44.432 --> 02:47.377
I studied, I studied hard and worked hard.

02:48.218 --> 02:49.740
But I learned the system too.

02:49.780 --> 02:51.062
I learned how to prepare.

02:51.903 --> 03:05.278
The reason that a lot of kids had trouble, or even veterans had trouble, they tried to cram at the end instead of studying every day, you know, working, preparing, getting ready.

03:05.298 --> 03:20.475
I never, on heavy exam days, we might have two exams on Friday morning, and I'd be in bed by 10.30, because I knew that was not the way to whip that place.

03:20.860 --> 03:29.130
because you learn by repetition, over and over and over.

03:29.151 --> 03:38.502
So Willie and I would sit there and we'd quiz each other, and half the time we'd have every question down, it would be on the exam.

03:38.522 --> 03:45.471
All right, now that and your, him having the benefit of him as a roommate began your second semester.

03:45.491 --> 03:46.432
Second semester.

03:46.452 --> 03:47.534
Did it continue?

03:48.455 --> 03:49.036
All the way through.

03:49.276 --> 03:50.057
All the way through, okay.

03:50.577 --> 03:56.945
There was no time then when you worried about do I stay or not.

03:57.465 --> 04:01.950
You did well that first year, and it was two semesters.

04:03.092 --> 04:04.774
What did you do that next summer?

04:04.794 --> 04:06.216
Well, we had to make the decision.

04:06.336 --> 04:19.251
When spring got here, in the spring of 1946, we had all those kids coming in, and see, they had been on an accelerated program, trimesters.

04:19.450 --> 04:20.311
You remember those?

04:20.871 --> 04:30.782
So we had to make a decision, and the faculty did.

04:30.802 --> 04:39.891
And the poor faculty, now I realize what onerous burden they carry.

04:40.973 --> 04:42.674
But at that time I didn't.

04:43.976 --> 04:48.040
And so we had to make a decision, are we going to

04:49.285 --> 04:51.247
go on through on the accelerated program?

04:51.487 --> 05:00.176
Are we going to cut out this summer and drop back to fall and go through on a four-year program?

05:00.196 --> 05:05.060
Well, as I mentioned, I thought my life had already passed me by.

05:06.362 --> 05:17.132
So I led, along with Willie and a lot of others, we opted to stay on the trimester system, although we never did like it that much.

05:18.445 --> 05:19.567
But a lot of others didn't.

05:19.607 --> 05:21.409
You remember Dr. Al Price?

05:22.250 --> 05:30.142
Well, he opted to drop out, then he came back, so he graduated a year later than I did, just because of the way he did.

05:30.983 --> 05:37.032
All right, so you then stayed on the trimester for three years and finished what was for others?

05:37.052 --> 05:38.674
I finished in June of 48.

05:38.694 --> 05:39.115
Of 48.

05:42.379 --> 05:47.727
In hindsight, what would you recommend be the curriculum today?

05:48.297 --> 05:54.728
Would it be three trimester years or four two-semester years?

05:54.748 --> 06:02.080
I'm kind of surprised that you asked me this because I fought for about seven years to get off that darn trimester system.

06:03.402 --> 06:04.324
Every way I could.

06:04.344 --> 06:11.436
I collared every president that we had, argued with every legislature I could.

06:11.737 --> 06:15.622
I never liked it, and I thought it was a bad sequel.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.264
And you still do?

06:17.284 --> 06:19.768
Yeah, even though I did.

06:19.788 --> 06:25.535
I think I understand your thinking, but why do you feel that way?

06:25.555 --> 06:27.938
It burned out students and faculty.

06:28.599 --> 06:31.243
It may have been tougher on faculty than students.

06:31.263 --> 06:35.989
And then, of course, from an academic standpoint, the killer is

06:38.045 --> 06:44.875
The killer is from the academic standpoint is there's no time for research, no time for scholarship, no time.

06:45.716 --> 06:54.990
No, I had about three real top missions when I went to Texas A&M.

06:55.170 --> 06:59.076
One was to get off the trimester system.

06:59.837 --> 07:03.443
Let's sidetrack on this man you mentioned named Alvin Price.

07:04.084 --> 07:05.706
Describe him as a student.

07:07.238 --> 07:07.719
You did?

07:08.039 --> 07:09.061
No, no, I want you to.

07:09.502 --> 07:10.483
Oh, you want me to.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.086
Describe him as a student.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.928
What kind of person was he?

07:13.948 --> 07:18.015
Al was older than I and a lot of the others.

07:19.137 --> 07:23.363
Alvin had been a lieutenant colonel, I believe, in the artillery.

07:25.026 --> 07:27.810
He was a tough nut.

07:27.830 --> 07:33.499
You know, he was hard, rigid, fair, honest, beyond words.

07:35.082 --> 07:44.335
But he was tough, and he was a good student, worked hard, and he made a good teacher, a good administrator.

07:45.557 --> 07:48.361
Did you, as a student, you all knew who he was?

07:48.722 --> 07:49.042
Oh, yeah.

07:49.924 --> 07:51.065
And we had a lot of them like him.

07:51.526 --> 07:58.957
You remember the man that got A&M out of all the trouble with Gibbs, Leon, do you remember him?

07:58.977 --> 08:00.499
Libs was a major in the artillery.

08:02.555 --> 08:06.541
Did Al Price as a student have a nickname?

08:07.021 --> 08:07.382
Slick.

08:07.402 --> 08:08.564
He was Slick as a student?

08:09.865 --> 08:12.309
Now, why did they call him Slick?

08:12.329 --> 08:12.790
I don't know.

08:12.850 --> 08:13.771
He just knew the work.

08:13.831 --> 08:15.453
He knew the way around.

08:16.235 --> 08:18.077
He was a good politician.

08:18.097 --> 08:20.040
That's what I've always assumed it meant.

08:20.206 --> 08:29.738
I think the name grew when he became a teacher because he was a good teacher.

08:30.799 --> 08:40.350
And he got the message across in a very smooth but very effective way.

08:40.390 --> 08:43.354
And perhaps because of his dress.

08:44.756 --> 08:46.618
Al was a neat dresser.

08:47.375 --> 08:50.760
wore nice clothes for that time and that place.

08:51.481 --> 08:57.088
I don't know if he did in 45 or not because he couldn't buy them, but it was a neat dresser.

08:57.429 --> 08:58.831
Did you have a student nickname?

08:59.492 --> 09:00.193
I never did, no.

09:01.495 --> 09:05.700
No, I don't think I had a student nickname.

09:08.665 --> 09:11.188
When did you begin to feel

09:11.607 --> 09:18.657
certain that you were on the right track and kind of began to relax, okay, I think I can do this work.

09:18.677 --> 09:20.880
How long did it take you?

09:20.900 --> 09:22.201
Just a few weeks, I think.

09:22.842 --> 09:25.646
So after that first set of tests, you, okay.

09:25.927 --> 09:35.139
Well, what you do is you go back and analyze it and you find out, well, did I really do that poorly?

09:35.700 --> 09:36.761
No, I hadn't.

09:37.002 --> 09:38.003
I'd done pretty well.

09:38.675 --> 09:45.385
But Dr. Cruz wanted everybody to know what the rumor was.

09:45.405 --> 09:47.889
He wanted to scare the living daylights out of it.

09:48.289 --> 09:48.730
And he did.

09:49.511 --> 10:01.509
As you look back, can you remember any conversations with any faculty member that you now realize were very important for you and your career and your life as a veterinarian?

10:03.012 --> 10:07.298
I guess I'd have to put about three men in that category.

10:07.683 --> 10:17.959
What I guess I owe the most to that made me think about academic medicine was a man by the name of Virgil Robinson.

10:19.381 --> 10:20.763
Do you ever remember him?

10:22.065 --> 10:24.870
Virgil was a pathologist and a good one.

10:25.671 --> 10:27.073
He was an Auburn graduate.

10:28.315 --> 10:29.497
He had a Ph.D.

10:29.517 --> 10:31.480
from Vanderbilt, I believe.

10:31.915 --> 10:38.124
at that time, and that was a rare bird that had that training at that time.

10:38.144 --> 10:47.919
And he taught basic pathology, and he was a big man, but he had an abnormally big head.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.622
You can imagine what he called it.

10:51.364 --> 10:53.767
Hydro, for hydrocephalus, you know.

10:53.967 --> 10:59.155
Well, I don't know if Dr. Robinson ever knew he had that name or not.

10:59.725 --> 11:07.234
Anyway, I remember about the time I was halfway through my senior year.

11:08.615 --> 11:12.700
I met Dr. Roberts in the hall one day, and he said, would you come into my office?

11:12.720 --> 11:14.081
What the devil have I done, you know?

11:15.263 --> 11:16.404
And he said, sit down.

11:16.544 --> 11:18.527
He said, I won't talk to you.

11:18.547 --> 11:23.252
He said, I want to tell you that I think you'd make a good academician.

11:24.312 --> 11:26.297
So I think you'd enjoy it.

11:26.418 --> 11:27.200
You're thorough.

11:27.681 --> 11:28.383
You work hard.

11:28.623 --> 11:29.746
You like to study.

11:29.827 --> 11:31.010
You obviously like to learn.

11:32.113 --> 11:34.379
So I guess he had a factor.

11:35.040 --> 11:39.452
He said, I have a communication here from

11:39.955 --> 11:41.638
a man up at Missouri.

11:42.840 --> 11:55.602
He said, his name is Elder, Cecil Elder, and he said he's looking for an assistant type, a flunky, graduate student, and so,

11:55.582 --> 12:06.660
He said, he's not a very good pathologist, but he said, you might profit from going there and said, you can see how the wind blows.

12:07.722 --> 12:19.501
He said, I'd rather send you somewhere where they had a better, a better, stronger department.

12:20.062 --> 12:21.825
They said they don't have a strong department.

12:22.278 --> 12:25.762
He said, they're trying to get started, but he said, you can learn something there.

12:27.443 --> 12:31.067
And, of course, they would pay me a fairly decent stipend.

12:32.008 --> 12:47.264
So I communicated with Dr. Elder, and later on, oh, in January, I mean later on, about the time I graduated or soon thereafter, I agreed to take a job without coming.

12:47.664 --> 12:49.146
I took it all as word.

12:49.750 --> 12:53.154
But he didn't want me to come until September.

12:54.415 --> 12:57.398
So I worked for the USDA in the summer of 48.

12:57.618 --> 13:09.951
Then I had Dr. Eads and Dr. Burns, both in physiology and pharmacology.

13:11.072 --> 13:14.436
One time or other, they would encourage me.

13:15.837 --> 13:18.340
They thought maybe I was worth saving.

13:19.298 --> 13:28.957
But Dr. Robinson was the one that I guess had the most, although I didn't stay with Dr. Elder and I didn't stay with pathology, although I would like to.

13:30.119 --> 13:34.928
Because I got here and I realized that what Dr. Robinson said was true in spades.

13:36.123 --> 13:39.227
And it wasn't a strong... It was not a good situation.

13:40.349 --> 13:42.872
So I left and went to practice.

13:43.373 --> 13:47.659
We got married that spring, right at the end of the semester.

13:48.881 --> 13:52.646
And was over at California, Missouri for a brief time.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.189
And I got brucellosis.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.173
I had a lot of development in such a short period of time.

13:59.615 --> 14:01.778
Let's see, back to A&M.

14:02.660 --> 14:05.083
What in those, in your...

14:05.924 --> 14:15.133
professional student studies, which now do you look back upon as the key courses that were the most important for you?

14:17.615 --> 14:25.603
Pathology, physiology, parasitology had a terribly weak microbiology professor.

14:27.425 --> 14:31.689
That was the worst thing I could say about A&M.

14:31.929 --> 14:34.632
Although I wound up,

14:35.675 --> 14:42.568
getting my PhD in microbiology and parasitology, but I sure didn't get it as a result of anything I got at A&M.

14:43.009 --> 14:48.300
Now what made those courses you listed as very positive, what made them the most important?

14:48.520 --> 14:52.267
Was it for you individually or was it most important for almost everybody?

14:52.568 --> 14:55.253
Well, they were the basis of medicine.

14:55.891 --> 15:03.583
Pathology and microbiology are the basis and physiology are the basis of medicine.

15:03.603 --> 15:07.109
Medicine wouldn't be anything without physiology.

15:07.970 --> 15:08.531
It's a key.

15:08.811 --> 15:09.793
All right.

15:09.973 --> 15:15.382
If you were in the context of this question, you have omnipotence.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.947
You can redo the veterinary curriculum completely.

15:20.249 --> 15:22.573
What would you have more of and less of?

15:27.802 --> 15:36.853
Well, some of the things that are in there are there for reasons because veterinarians are trained broadly.

15:36.893 --> 15:44.483
And you have to have those in there because they have to take the state boards and meet the needs.

15:44.543 --> 15:48.327
And some are going to be, not all of them are going to be academicians.

15:49.128 --> 15:52.312
Not all of them are going to be researchers.

15:52.332 --> 15:53.674
Not all are going to be teachers.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.947
So you have to have a general program.

15:56.909 --> 16:01.315
And I'm not sure I know much of anything I'd take out.

16:02.516 --> 16:08.044
I still think you have to have those core courses.

16:08.064 --> 16:10.667
I would have less anatomy today.

16:11.609 --> 16:18.438
And I don't say that because I'm influenced with super knowledge.

16:19.119 --> 16:23.745
But I think at that time we were studying too much anatomy in my rope memory.

16:23.843 --> 16:28.688
And so, and medical schools and veterinary schools have reduced it.

16:28.708 --> 16:31.672
All right, and what would you add more then?

16:31.712 --> 16:34.655
If you had some extra space, what would you add to it?

16:35.496 --> 16:37.378
What would you give more of?

16:38.439 --> 16:50.172
Well, it may not be very logical, but when I knew that Richard was going to Texas A&M, I tried to brainwash him a little bit.

16:50.692 --> 16:55.859
to get him to strengthen the Department of Veterinary Public Health.

16:57.281 --> 17:05.874
And now that would seem to fly in the face of what I told you, that physiology and microbiology and pathology are the key.

17:06.735 --> 17:08.157
That is, that's the foundation.

17:08.798 --> 17:20.074
But the reason that I'd like to see Richard or any young dean that would go into the job there, because of the changing in our society today

17:20.678 --> 17:32.295
the need for veterinarians to understand public health, how to implement it, how to increase it, how to develop it.

17:32.756 --> 17:34.999
And we need the research program to go with it.

17:36.562 --> 17:42.510
And I had a chance at A&M to consolidate some departments.

17:43.592 --> 17:47.057
I would not have consolidated veterinary public health with anything.

17:47.881 --> 18:10.007
But when Dr. Shattuck came in, he was one, we'd laugh about veterinary deans, any dean, of being either a lumper or either put all the things together or take them apart, scatter them.

18:11.050 --> 18:17.338
Doctor, a lot of the young deans that came in about 10 years ago were lumpers.

18:18.239 --> 18:20.342
So they'd lump two or three departments together.

18:21.463 --> 18:28.612
And what they wound up doing is lumping, especially in a big school like A&M, they'd lump three departments together.

18:28.632 --> 18:36.301
And what they did, they spread the department head across such a broad range that he had no longer a span of control.

18:38.624 --> 18:39.285
All right.

18:39.434 --> 18:59.899
Back to your coursework and labs and so forth, do you remember any specific experiences that were kind of life-changing in the lab or in something that you discovered for yourself that made a deep impression on you as a veterinarian-to-be?

19:01.461 --> 19:03.163
This was back in school.

19:06.367 --> 19:18.503
Someday you stumbled onto something that you wanted to spend half your life learning more about or that you wanted to be a crusader to help make the world safer because of this, that, or the other.

19:21.503 --> 19:28.272
Back in those days, that was before so many changes happened in the profession.

19:29.774 --> 19:36.223
That was before what we talk today, we say that the veterinary profession has been urbanized and feminized.

19:36.284 --> 19:46.718
That was in the day, and because of my background, I thought food animal medicine, farm practice was so terribly important.

19:47.643 --> 19:58.682
And so I think that was one of the reasons that I wanted to go in a certain direction and wanted to see that strengthened.

19:59.050 --> 20:02.693
And when I went to A&M, I was able to do that to some degree.

20:03.554 --> 20:07.058
Although, unfortunately, I was late getting it started.

20:07.218 --> 20:08.038
It's still hurting.

20:08.499 --> 20:09.520
It's still hurting today.

20:10.100 --> 20:16.747
We have, at this school here, we have 75% of the first-year classes are women.

20:16.767 --> 20:20.270
I am not, I guess, women in the veterinary profession.

20:20.330 --> 20:21.191
Never was.

20:21.351 --> 20:27.657
I worked every way in the world I could to get them admitted 30 years ago.

20:27.974 --> 20:32.920
And I wanted to see them enter the profession, just like I wanted to see black students and Spanish students.

20:34.682 --> 20:35.964
But it went too far.

20:37.966 --> 20:40.990
And of course, a lot of it's out of the control of anybody.

20:41.991 --> 20:45.115
The reason it's out of the control is the way agriculture's going.

20:46.337 --> 20:55.348
And when we have things like premium standard farms, the veterinarians are not going to be out there treating those sick pigs.

20:57.573 --> 21:11.659
And so you're saying to me in a way veterinary medicine has gone away from food animal practice toward pets and exotic?

21:12.842 --> 21:13.242
Horses.

21:13.643 --> 21:14.765
And horses.

21:14.785 --> 21:18.332
And not as much now as it was in horses because—

21:18.700 --> 21:23.226
Too many people went and broke a horse for her.

21:23.246 --> 21:24.788
All right.

21:25.489 --> 21:25.829
Let's see.

21:25.849 --> 21:29.053
Now, somewhere along the line, you met this special young lady.

21:29.954 --> 21:34.821
How did that occur, this young lady that you've spent a number of years with?

21:35.922 --> 21:36.583
How did it occur?

21:36.743 --> 21:36.983
Yeah.

21:37.043 --> 21:38.125
Where did you all meet?

21:38.645 --> 21:40.708
Well, I've known that young lady since she was

21:41.549 --> 21:43.111
in the first grade.

21:44.974 --> 21:47.799
And they're seven years different to our ages.

21:47.899 --> 21:48.780
I'm seven years older.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.045
And she was kind of an impressive little girl.

21:52.106 --> 21:54.630
She was kind of a smart, I think, kind of impertinent.

21:55.271 --> 21:55.952
No, I'm kidding.

21:56.192 --> 21:58.416
She wasn't.

21:58.776 --> 22:03.844
But I remember, she was a little slender, tiny thing, blonde-headed, wore her hair with

22:04.043 --> 22:07.035
straight across the road, kind of cutting bags a little higher.

22:08.761 --> 22:14.323
Her father at that time farmed pretty close to where my father did.

22:16.075 --> 22:20.182
Well, then, of course, I went on the way to high school and to the service.

22:20.403 --> 22:22.206
I didn't see her for years.

22:23.007 --> 22:34.708
But she would come out in the summers and work with her grandparents that lived only a few miles, three or four miles.

22:35.296 --> 22:40.148
I didn't see her then, but she still tells a lot of stories about her grandmother.

22:41.331 --> 22:45.000
And her grandmother and grandfather were very, very impressive people.

22:46.985 --> 22:50.213
They were way ahead of their time in many ways.

22:50.955 --> 22:52.579
And her grandmother was

22:53.386 --> 23:02.301
very strict about the way things should be done, and it rubbed off on my granddaughter.

23:03.102 --> 23:06.768
And she still observes it.

23:06.788 --> 23:10.294
When Grandmother Eads peeled the tomatoes, she gills the tomatoes.

23:12.297 --> 23:17.706
Anyway, then, as I mentioned, when I came back from service,

23:18.344 --> 23:26.996
I was at A&M, and heterosexual social life was almost impossible.

23:27.016 --> 23:35.748
There were no women at A&M, just none, except they'd bring a few in on holidays.

23:35.768 --> 23:39.373
So I would go to Stephen Bowl occasionally.

23:39.809 --> 23:52.974
Then as I got on into my junior year and my senior year, well, I would be there sometimes for a holiday and we would have a date to go to a movie or something like that.

23:54.056 --> 23:57.362
And so things went from one

23:58.895 --> 24:01.138
One situation to the other, I guess.

24:01.258 --> 24:07.747
And after I graduated, I mentioned I worked for the USDA one summer.

24:08.868 --> 24:11.852
And I started work at Meridian, Texas.

24:11.872 --> 24:12.713
You know where that is.

24:12.753 --> 24:15.637
And I'd get weekends off.

24:16.438 --> 24:20.984
So for some reason or other, I'd be at Arlington quite a bit.

24:22.506 --> 24:27.973
Then the first thing I knew, they told me that I told them up front.

24:28.595 --> 24:31.018
You know, I was going to work that summer.

24:31.098 --> 24:33.981
I wasn't going to be a regular USDA veterinarian.

24:35.702 --> 24:38.525
But the men in charge didn't believe that.

24:39.927 --> 24:40.648
I guess they didn't.

24:40.748 --> 24:42.349
They kept on trying to recruit me.

24:43.651 --> 24:48.716
But then the second move I had, it went all the way to George West.

24:50.278 --> 24:54.602
So it was pretty hard to get back to Arlington all weekend.

24:55.831 --> 24:59.615
Then the summer was over and I came to Missouri.

25:01.117 --> 25:08.204
And by that time, she had decided maybe she might put up with me for the next 50 years or so.

25:09.606 --> 25:13.450
So then we got married at the end of, in February of 49.

25:14.511 --> 25:18.435
So you're out of vet school less than a year?

25:18.756 --> 25:19.356
Less than a year.

25:19.516 --> 25:21.478
Less than a year.

25:21.498 --> 25:21.599
Yeah.

25:21.619 --> 25:22.660
Okay.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.842
Let's see.

25:25.514 --> 25:27.857
I was talking, let's go back to A&M things.

25:29.219 --> 25:36.889
Some special, special friends, associates, colleagues that you made during those years.

25:38.131 --> 25:44.359
Who were some of the key associates for you, friends you made during those A&M years?

25:44.719 --> 25:46.662
Oh, I suppose the most.

25:47.958 --> 25:56.606
A true friend and the one that I remember and we've kept in touch most was my roommate, Willie Troja.

25:56.626 --> 26:04.512
He was a little, what do you call the French in Louisiana?

26:04.532 --> 26:04.893
Cajun.

26:04.913 --> 26:05.533
Cajun.

26:05.553 --> 26:06.774
Little French Cajun.

26:07.215 --> 26:09.937
He had snappy black eyes, you know, just snapped.

26:11.699 --> 26:12.639
He's a good man.

26:13.660 --> 26:14.921
I appreciate Willie.

26:15.142 --> 26:16.783
We've been friends a long time.

26:17.962 --> 26:20.126
Oh, there were a few others.

26:20.146 --> 26:28.481
A lot of them, of course, I have a warm spot in my heart for, but wasn't real close to.

26:28.501 --> 26:37.877
I guess I couldn't name any that were that special.

26:38.617 --> 26:43.244
All right, you started out with, you said 64 were admitted, about 60 enrolled.

26:43.745 --> 26:53.500
Yeah, and see, then they increased it as much as they could for the class that started in the fall of 46.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.843
I think they went to 72.

26:56.264 --> 27:00.611
Didn't have room for them, but they went to... About how many graduated?

27:02.133 --> 27:02.774
My class?

27:02.794 --> 27:05.518
Well, I think about 50.

27:06.038 --> 27:07.620
So maybe five out of six.

27:07.880 --> 27:08.721
Yeah.

27:08.741 --> 27:10.063
Now, some of them graduated later.

27:10.704 --> 27:12.346
But that was quite good, wasn't it?

27:12.366 --> 27:16.290
That was good, yeah.

27:16.310 --> 27:23.479
As you recall that commencement time, was there a commencement ceremony that was memorable for you?

27:23.719 --> 27:28.445
No, it wasn't very memorable, except it wasn't much of them.

27:28.465 --> 27:31.168
They gathered us all up and had it in Kyle Field.

27:32.330 --> 27:36.914
And we had a speaker, and I couldn't tell you who he was or a word he said.

27:36.934 --> 27:41.158
Did the veterinary students graduate at the same ceremony as everybody else?

27:41.598 --> 27:43.040
Just a lump sum.

27:43.460 --> 27:44.601
Was every name called?

27:44.701 --> 27:45.782
Was every hand shaken?

27:46.663 --> 27:48.064
No.

27:48.084 --> 27:50.767
Who came from your family?

27:50.787 --> 27:51.968
My mother and father came.

27:53.109 --> 27:55.931
I guess my sister, I don't remember, but yeah, I'm sure she did.

27:56.812 --> 27:57.453
That's about it.

27:57.833 --> 27:59.495
And you were not seriously yet?

27:59.515 --> 28:00.556
Oh, no.

28:00.836 --> 28:01.276
No, no.

28:01.316 --> 28:02.117
Not that serious.

28:02.671 --> 28:07.038
And that first job, do you remember what the pay was?

28:08.120 --> 28:10.143
I got $44 every other week.

28:11.245 --> 28:13.629
That'd be $88 a month, wasn't it?

28:14.110 --> 28:14.731
Roughly.

28:14.751 --> 28:17.496
That was with the USD?

28:17.556 --> 28:17.756
Yeah.

28:18.417 --> 28:20.260
But of course they had a good bit of benefits.

28:21.983 --> 28:29.235
Part of the basic salary would have been something like $1,800 a year.

28:30.127 --> 28:40.381
But by the time I got through taking off for this and that and something else, it wasn't very much, although $44 was more then than this.

28:40.401 --> 28:47.591
What was your first pay as a professional veterinarian here at the University of Missouri?

28:47.611 --> 28:48.111
Do you remember?

28:51.175 --> 28:55.341
Yeah, it was roughly $3,100 a year or something like that.

28:56.080 --> 28:56.421
3,100.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.168
I could look that up, but that's about right.

29:01.348 --> 29:02.610
All right.

29:04.493 --> 29:11.364
A few questions now that have to do with Aggie feelings, spirit, etc.

29:14.169 --> 29:20.198
What creates the depth of feeling

29:20.988 --> 29:22.750
about A&M.

29:23.191 --> 29:35.526
Why do those of us who have had a tie, what creates that loyalty, that feeling?

29:35.546 --> 29:38.710
Not sure I could answer that for the student today.

29:38.730 --> 29:47.080
I think for the students at our time, there was a, for the veteran students, there was a

29:48.292 --> 29:58.068
a closely knit feeling, but not as closely knit as the Corps.

29:58.248 --> 29:59.170
Nothing like that.

30:00.091 --> 30:10.789
But there was never any doubt that if you were in school at that time that you were friends, maybe not

30:11.039 --> 30:13.081
Both were buddies, but you were friends.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.306
And you'd been through a lot of the same battles.

30:17.326 --> 30:21.390
You'd been at Sing Sing on the browsers.

30:23.573 --> 30:28.138
You're wearing a certain kind of ring there that I've seen a few people wear.

30:28.638 --> 30:30.581
Why?

30:30.601 --> 30:32.523
Because I earned it, I guess.

30:34.124 --> 30:36.507
Oh, I feel a pride in Texas A&M.

30:37.769 --> 30:49.482
I'm torn today because of allegiance between the University of Missouri and Texas A&M, but I'll always have a deep feeling before A&M.

30:54.987 --> 31:00.213
We're getting close to the conclusion of this part.

31:01.054 --> 31:07.641
What did it mean to you in your life that you attended A&M, if you could have gone somewhere else?

31:08.212 --> 31:09.775
might feel different.

31:09.795 --> 31:15.023
What did it mean that it was at A&M?

31:15.043 --> 31:20.933
I think, to me, it had a deeper meaning because of the military background.

31:22.135 --> 31:33.274
And although I never was a corpsman at Texas A&M, of course I was at Tarleton, some of the same feeling, although it was much more meaningful at A&M.

31:34.098 --> 31:36.621
But I think the military may have had a factor.

31:37.182 --> 31:45.111
I think the fact that we looked upon A&M as the poor boys' school.

31:45.372 --> 31:47.855
We had the kids coming out of the project houses.

31:48.656 --> 31:51.639
They weren't wealthy kids.

31:51.779 --> 31:56.185
I think it was because, for me, it was an agricultural college.

31:56.906 --> 31:58.047
And I'd grown up on a farm.
