WEBVTT

00:05.549 --> 00:11.698
Colonel Wilcox, I'd like you to start off just 
telling me a little bit about your military

00:05.549 --> 00:11.698
history. And I guess it began with the Aggie Corps? 
Right. I graduated from Curran High School here in

00:15.743 --> 00:32.687
Galveston in 54 and went to Texas A&M and graduated 
from Texas A&M in 1958

00:15.743 --> 00:32.687
with a degree in marketing and insurance and Also 
at that time, I was in the Corps of Cadets, and I

00:33.376 --> 00:43.807
became a second lieutenant of infantry upon 
graduation, and then went to Fort Benning,

00:33.376 --> 00:43.807
Georgia for the basic officer's course. Okay. Now 
to start talking about exactly what you did in

00:46.691 --> 00:50.755
Vietnam. On your first tour, could you describe 
briefly your responsibilities and position in

00:51.796 --> 00:58.344
your first tour? Okay. The first time I was over 
there was April of 1967. through April of 1968,

01:04.088 --> 01:12.400
which was part of the Tet Offensive of 1968 in 
Vietnam.

01:12.740 --> 01:20.511
The first time I was an advisor to a Arvin 
battalion, a senior advisor to a battalion. It was

01:20.851 --> 01:24.056
myself and a sergeant. And we two was the entire 
American forces with about 2,500 men Battalion,

01:34.193 --> 01:45.524
which had the responsibility to guard a American 
and Vietnamese Air Force Base, which was called

01:34.193 --> 01:45.524
Tan Son Nuc. Tan Son Nuc Air Force Base was in or 
outside of Saigon. Also, this battalion, a

01:49.968 --> 02:02.040
Vietnamese battalion, was responsible for not 
only guarding this outer belt of the Tan Son Nuc Air

01:49.968 --> 02:02.040
Force Base, but it had the responsibility to guard 
the training center which was located in the area

02:02.830 --> 02:09.536
on the outer belt of the Air Force Base. This 
training center does the same thing as an American

02:10.917 --> 02:16.022
training center does. It trains individuals in 
about eight weeks from a ROAR recruit to a fighting

02:16.723 --> 02:27.973
soldier that goes out and takes his place in a 
normal battalion. ROAR goes on to some advanced

02:28.874 --> 02:31.656
training such as the airborne Ranger-type 
training. My job there was to be an advisor, only

02:34.893 --> 02:45.124
advisor, to the battalion commander that was in 
charge of the security for that area. And I had no

02:46.205 --> 02:48.567
role in command. As advisor, our sole purpose was 
to try to advise the Vietnamese counterpart, in

02:49.589 --> 03:01.221
this case he was a major and I was also at that time, 
on some of the tactics to be successful. Also, we

03:05.762 --> 03:14.613
were available since we had American units 
backing us up from the standpoint that we were in

03:05.762 --> 03:14.613
communication with American units. We could call 
upon American artillery fire with his approval,

03:14.633 --> 03:30.432
and we could call upon American gunships to come 
in, which are helicopters, to come in and support

03:14.633 --> 03:30.432
us if they were available and if he wanted them 
after We were nicely trying to talk him into using

03:31.323 --> 03:34.928
these things. So we were there to provide advice 
and also to provide fire support to him if he wanted

03:35.408 --> 03:44.620
to. As a senior advisor to the Army Battalion at 
Saigon, what types of fighting tactics were

03:44.640 --> 03:50.788
taught? Well, our battalion, and I say our because 
I felt like I was a part of the battalion, we were a

03:50.808 --> 04:00.621
security unit, and we put out patrols at night. up 
patrols during the day to ambush any infiltrators

04:00.955 --> 04:30.017
that may be coming in also to provide security at 
the main intersections within the training site

04:00.955 --> 04:30.017
training site was about two and a half miles oh 
about two and a half miles wide maybe about three

04:00.955 --> 04:30.017
miles long it covered a live fire training range 
and some of the tactical maneuver training

04:30.402 --> 04:57.355
grounds that they had out there and for the most 
part everything was done to provide security to

04:30.402 --> 04:57.355
keep the Viet Cong which were somewhere in the area 
or the North Vietnamese regular battalions out of

04:30.402 --> 04:57.355
the area so they wouldn't attack the train 
training outfits while they were trying to train

04:30.402 --> 04:57.355
and then I say we also had an additional mission to 
provide security for the American-Vietnamese

04:57.875 --> 05:04.264
Air Force Base, which was located in Saigon and 
Tanzania. Okay. What exactly was the difference,

05:06.267 --> 05:18.905
I was just wondering, the official relationship 
between this earlier phase of the war when we were

05:06.267 --> 05:18.905
advisors, you were an advisor, and to later when 
they were commanders? Well, this goes back, oh, in

05:18.925 --> 05:27.797
around the 60s, 60 to 62 or so. when the Americans 
went in under the auspices of a military advisory

05:28.553 --> 05:53.768
group and we in fact only advised and did not in fact 
get into combat we went with them we were not

05:28.553 --> 05:53.768
supposed to fire at that time but that wasn't the 
situation when I was there when I was there we had

05:28.553 --> 05:53.768
advisors who protected themselves and were in 
combat but were advisors. But we also had regular

05:56.099 --> 05:58.983
American units that were there fighting. In my 
case, on this first tour, I was there as an advisor.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.273
I did fire when I was fired upon. An officer who's 
trying to advise can't really get into the front

06:08.074 --> 06:22.472
line tactics and act as a rifleman when he's back 
there with the commander trying to advise from an

06:08.074 --> 06:22.472
advantage point. The second time when I went over 
this area, I was with an American battalion, or

06:22.942 --> 06:36.196
actually American Division 101st Airborne, 
which was in fact engaged with the enemy, and we

06:22.942 --> 06:36.196
weren't advising anybody. We were just fighting.

06:40.180 --> 06:51.312
Why do the Arvin troops need such intense training 
in light of their familiarity with their own

06:40.180 --> 06:51.312
country and the grill of fighting that they've 
been associated with since the 1930s? Again, I'm

06:51.967 --> 06:55.371
going to have to give you some of my opinions on it. 
From what I could see, the orphan battalions were

06:56.672 --> 07:00.557
not well equipped. When I was there in 67, when I 
first got there, they had a lot of old, obsolete

07:01.578 --> 07:10.347
arms. You're probably not familiar with what I'm 
going to say, but back, oh, about 1950s, we had in

07:12.089 --> 07:21.720
our training sites what we called water-cooled 
machine guns. which was a five-gallon can of water

07:22.223 --> 07:34.120
attached to a rubber hose that cooled the machine 
gun down so it would not burn the barrels up when you

07:22.223 --> 07:34.120
fired them on a training range. They had these 
weapons in actual combat. The Americans had

07:36.443 --> 07:39.928
washed them out of their system 10, 15, 20 years 
before that. They had a lot of old World War II arms,

07:41.050 --> 07:49.141
carbines that the Americans were not using at all. 
Our government was trying to upgrade their

07:52.582 --> 08:21.137
weaponry with the new m16 rifles the automatic 
rifles and we were sent in to advise them how to use

07:52.582 --> 08:21.137
these weapons and i would say we were there to try to 
teach them how to do it the american way even though

07:52.582 --> 08:21.137
we a lot of talk was said that well we were just 
trying to help them and advance

07:52.582 --> 08:21.137
their training we were really in fact trying to 
show them how to do it the american way so that We

08:21.775 --> 08:23.036
thought our way was the best.

08:26.100 --> 08:33.028
How did the tradition of the Arvin families 
following their husbands into combat locations

08:26.100 --> 08:33.028
affect their attitudes? I didn't see too much of 
that. The battalion I was with worked out of a

08:35.471 --> 08:41.458
location. We did not really move from that area. We 
had the responsibility for, I say, the outer belt

08:44.962 --> 08:48.586
of the Tonsenuk. We had the responsibility for the 
training center. And we didn't go from place to

08:51.053 --> 08:56.460
place to place like some other battalions did. The 
family was there. And I might digress a second

09:00.024 --> 09:01.566
here. I knew a major who was in the Vietnamese Army 
who was other than the one I was advising. And we

09:08.816 --> 09:20.250
talked about sometimes

09:08.816 --> 09:20.250
on Sunday afternoons, you would think that there 
was no war going on at all, that they would be in

09:08.816 --> 09:20.250
civilian clothes. And it would seem like that 
nobody would attack us or we wouldn't attack

09:20.922 --> 09:25.529
anybody on Sundays. I'm talking when I was with the 
Army Battalion now, Republic of Vietnam. And they

09:30.777 --> 09:38.167
said, well, you know, you people come over here, I 
mean Americans, and you fight for a year and you go

09:30.777 --> 09:38.167
home to your family. He said, we live this day in and 
day out, seven days a week. So on Sunday

09:42.073 --> 09:45.859
afternoons, if we don't have any problems, then we 
kind of relax. And it was kind of an unwritten law

09:46.760 --> 09:48.803
that the, Sunday afternoons, it was pretty 
peaceful.

09:54.671 --> 10:03.823
How significant was, although this may not apply 
to your position now, but how significant was

09:54.671 --> 10:03.823
Arvin's desertion in combat? How committed were 
the men in training? Well, I felt that the training

10:06.967 --> 10:14.577
that they received was as good as the people they 
had trained them. That if you had a good, strong

10:15.398 --> 10:18.402
commander, who was really pushing at him and 
getting the job done, then the soldiers under him

10:18.938 --> 10:28.448
were doing the same thing. You have to kind of look 
at how the Vietnamese Army recruited. Much

10:33.953 --> 10:35.975
different than the recruitment of the American 
Army. In the American Army, you'll be called up or

10:36.676 --> 10:43.323
you'll go down and volunteer and say, I want to 
join. But in the Vietnamese Army, that's not the

10:44.063 --> 10:45.805
way it works. Not all the time. They'll run a 
patrol. down through a town and any individual

10:49.027 --> 11:18.966
they catch who fits between a certain age bracket 
that particular day they will put in a two and a half

10:49.027 --> 11:18.966
ton truck which is a truck they use and bring one out 
to training i mean they they might be going to

10:49.027 --> 11:18.966
church and lo and behold their next day they're 
training at a training center and their family is

10:49.027 --> 11:18.966
left and don't know what happened to them or 
anything else until they finally write them and

10:49.027 --> 11:18.966
say hey i just got drafted so they had a very 
peculiar way of drafting by just going out and

11:19.385 --> 11:23.290
grabbing me off the street. And in some cases, and 
we've done it in our army too, unwritten I guess, a

11:23.311 --> 11:34.707
guy gets in trouble with the police and the police 
says, well, we won't press charges if you go down

11:23.311 --> 11:34.707
and enlist. So the guy goes down and enlists so he 
doesn't go to jail or do other things. And this has

11:37.791 --> 11:43.098
happened a few times you've probably heard about 
in our own army. Now I'd like to turn the interview

11:43.359 --> 11:49.307
over to the Tet Offensive in 1968. You're a very 
prominent part of this since you were an actual

11:49.912 --> 11:54.176
observer. Maybe you could describe the events of 
the day, the day of the attack on Saigon. What were

12:01.423 --> 12:03.305
your initial thoughts when it occurred? Well, I 
had just got back from R&R. Actually, R&R is Arrest

12:08.130 --> 12:10.913
and Recuperation. The American forces were given 
six days.

12:17.819 --> 12:18.400
Let me think now. I think it was two weeks, I'm 
sorry. And at that time, you could travel anywhere

12:22.741 --> 12:25.464
you wanted. So I went to Hawaii and got back about 
two weeks before the Tet Offensive. And it was kind

12:31.209 --> 12:33.852
of peaceful and quiet. And I had sat down and talked 
with my counterpart, which we called our

12:33.892 --> 12:41.139
individual we were giving advice to. And my 
sergeant was there. And we had gone over a few

12:44.442 --> 12:49.247
things which could have happened. And generally, 
the attacks, every year is Tet. They have this

12:52.997 --> 12:54.679
ceremony every year. And every year, you 
generally didn't have too much problem where we

12:55.260 --> 12:58.504
were. We were in Saigon, which was the capital of 
Vietnam at that time. And people generally would

13:03.891 --> 13:09.178
have their wars out in the rice farms areas. And 
Saigon would generally be pretty quiet, and

13:09.278 --> 13:14.545
nobody would bother anybody. Maybe there's a few 
shootings on the street, but Otherwise, it was

13:16.784 --> 13:19.727
kind of a quiet, peaceful area. So we had been 
talking about it, and the Viennese commander I

13:20.689 --> 13:38.089
talked to had decided that he felt, based on 
reports that he was receiving through his

13:20.689 --> 13:38.089
intelligence, that there may be some kind of 
offensive in the Saigon area. So he wasn't going to

13:38.970 --> 13:42.654
put as many troops out on vacation. And Tet 
offensive, I mean, Tet is like christmas for us so

13:45.742 --> 14:08.560
he decided he wasn't going to put as many out and 
that the training center commander and you

13:45.742 --> 14:08.560
remember we were talking about two different 
people we're a security force for a training

13:45.742 --> 14:08.560
center but we also had a general guinea general 
that was in charge of the training center and so

13:45.742 --> 14:08.560
they decided they weren't going to put as many 
people on vacation to include the trainees uh as

14:09.383 --> 14:37.467
they had before because they felt that something 
was going to happen how they got this source i don't

14:09.383 --> 14:37.467
really know because i wasn't getting that much 
source from my own american side of the house they

14:09.383 --> 14:37.467
felt yeah there's going to be something going on 
but they didn't expect what we'd get into from the

14:09.383 --> 14:37.467
standpoint of i didn't know about what we were 
going to get into i don't know if anybody else did

14:09.383 --> 14:37.467
but so we were ready somewhat for what was going on 
we had plenty of ammunition we'd all always been

14:09.383 --> 14:37.467
pretty well prepared for anything because the VC, 
now VC is an individual who is a civilian by day and a

14:38.054 --> 14:47.884
soldier by night. He's not really a North 
Vietnamese Viet Cong type. He's a South

14:52.929 --> 14:58.736
Vietnamese soldier for the North Vietnam. You 
understand all that? So he's, we fell through some

15:01.018 --> 15:05.783
sources and we had been picking up information. 
We've been picking up some caches of arms that

15:08.463 --> 15:11.487
something was going to happen. Didn't know how big 
it was going to be. So we had reinforced a lot of

15:14.211 --> 15:19.858
areas where there were main routes in the area. We 
had two main highways leading in to Saigon that

15:19.898 --> 15:28.310
came right through our training center, which was 
one was Highway 13 and Highway 1. And we had already

15:29.471 --> 15:36.681
built long ago brick strongholds or pillboxes, if 
you want to call it that, and we'd already had these

15:37.336 --> 15:40.460
things with sandbags and what have you. So we put 
more ammunition in. We put additional firepower.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.730
We were using .50 caliber machine guns we put in 
there. We had put in, and this is all Vietnamese

15:49.673 --> 16:00.528
stuff, and I say when I say we, they, had beefed it 
up, put additional personnel, tried to improve

15:49.673 --> 16:00.528
some of the communications to them so we knew what 
was going on. And the Knight of Tet, We kind of

16:06.513 --> 16:07.494
lucked out. The first round that they fired on us 
was a RKG round, which is something like a bazooka

16:09.477 --> 16:17.107
round. And they fired that at the main bunker 
leading through Highway 13, I believe it was. And

16:26.119 --> 16:31.305
the rocket hit a cement pillar instead of hitting 
the bunker. Now, these RPGs they used could go

16:32.066 --> 16:35.371
through a tank. It hit the bunker... a pillow, 
which is a cement pillow, to the side of the bunker,

16:37.192 --> 16:44.561
not the bunker itself, which pretty well got 
everybody awake when those things hit. They then

16:46.023 --> 16:58.898
saw, they, meaning the South Vietnamese, saw 
where the round had came from, so they fired back a

16:46.023 --> 16:58.898
50-caliber machine gun and what have you, and it 
was down a kind of a ditch-like on the side of the

16:46.023 --> 16:58.898
road. And they had caught the VCs and, in this case, 
North Vietnamese soldiers by surprise. and uh

17:07.482 --> 17:34.958
well we had three days of good fighting that time i 
say good fighting i mean real close in fighting we

17:07.482 --> 17:34.958
killed 97 of them and captured about three 
truckloads of equipment and we lost seven of our

17:07.482 --> 17:34.958
own uh no americans but just seven of our own now 
this is just our battalion other things are going

17:07.482 --> 17:34.958
on around us in other zones that was unbelievable 
but uh I think for the response that we had from this

17:35.714 --> 17:47.349
particular bunker area and them missing the 
bunker area with the first shot really kind of

17:35.714 --> 17:47.349
turned the tide for us.

17:51.374 --> 17:55.980
Did you consider it an American victory at the 
time? You mean of our little thing going on there or

17:56.000 --> 18:01.147
just the whole Tet offensive? Right, the whole 
Tet, I think. It's hard for me to say American

18:05.313 --> 18:09.399
victory because I was working with the 
Vietnamese. I felt they did a real good job in

18:09.419 --> 18:15.528
repulsing the attacks.

18:17.050 --> 18:19.153
We had lost a lot when they got in. Everybody was 
shaking their heads how they could infiltrate and

18:19.213 --> 18:25.022
get into Saigon.

18:26.083 --> 18:28.607
The roads were always being checked. Buses and 
what have you were being checked, and different

18:29.067 --> 18:34.375
types of trucks and what have you being checked. 
But when this offensive took effect, it seems like

18:34.912 --> 18:46.126
the North Vietnamese and the VCs were everywhere, 
behind us, around us, front of us, left and right.

18:47.267 --> 18:49.750
And a lot of questions were asked. I know General 
Westmoreland, the American general, had a lot of

18:49.890 --> 19:02.806
questions for his staff on how could all these 
people get in to Saigon without somebody finding

18:49.890 --> 19:02.806
out about it. And I don't know if that was ever 
answered. But I personally didn't think it was a

19:05.050 --> 19:09.675
victory from the standpoint of them getting in. I 
thought it was a victory from the standpoint of us

19:10.295 --> 19:14.219
repulsing them after they had got in. But no, I 
think we should have had better security, both

19:15.461 --> 19:24.470
American and Vietnamese side, so that they 
wouldn't have got in to start with.

19:27.573 --> 19:29.775
Even though we still, well, We killed so many of the 
Viet Cong, almost 15,000. Do you see it as a

19:34.459 --> 19:38.244
psychological victory for the enemy? 
Psychological victory for the enemy. Well, no,

19:45.754 --> 19:48.838
not really. I feel really that, in personal 
opinion again, not any official government

19:49.039 --> 19:58.952
opinion, but my opinion, is that We really didn't 
win a thing. We went over there, we fought, we

20:02.595 --> 20:08.062
bombed, we advised. But when you do this and you 
don't go to the source of the problem, in the early

20:09.223 --> 20:17.513
stages of the war, we could not cross over to 
Cambodia and fight. We could not bomb in Cambodia.

20:19.595 --> 20:29.547
We could not fire across the border in Cambodia 
because we were more than given the authority by

20:19.595 --> 20:29.547
our government or whatever president might be in 
power at that time uh you couldn't carry the war to

20:30.286 --> 20:58.369
north vietnam nobody wanted to go across from 
south to north and attack them we wasn't bombing

20:30.286 --> 20:58.369
north vietnam they were using ho chi minh trail to 
bring equipment down then some of our presidents

20:30.286 --> 20:58.369
decide well yes okay let's go ahead and do that we 
did that my personal opinion is that if we wanted to

20:30.286 --> 20:58.369
end that war we could have won it and ended in 30 days 
by turning loose the united states air force the

20:59.075 --> 21:06.682
Strategic Air Command or any of the other big 
powers that we have and wipe North Vietnam off the

20:59.075 --> 21:06.682
map if we wanted to. But again here, I'm sure that 
people higher than I was was concerned that if we

21:06.922 --> 21:19.934
did take North Vietnam out or Red China, we would 
have probably got into a bigger, more wider-scale

21:06.922 --> 21:19.934
war. And I think they were really—we were really 
putting out brush fires when the the Red Chinese

21:27.644 --> 21:34.313
and the North Vietnamese were kind of sitting back 
and not getting the full brunt of anything. We were

21:34.353 --> 21:37.237
fighting in South Vietnam for quite a long time. 
Our presence then, yeah, okay, did decide, and I

21:38.219 --> 21:56.824
think the 101st went in, and I'm not sure of this, 
and the 1st Division went across the border into

21:38.219 --> 21:56.824
Cambodia, and we did do some bombing in the north, 
quite a bit of bombing if you're seen James

21:57.547 --> 22:00.810
Fonder's stories. But then

22:02.692 --> 22:07.676
we didn't continue with it. We did it for a while, 
and the public opinion got upset, and all those

22:07.736 --> 22:11.599
other things went on. We stopped, and they built 
back up again, and here we were fighting in the

22:11.980 --> 22:15.623
South again. How did the military measure 
progress? Which one? The New Year's of the

22:24.971 --> 22:27.233
Americans. Well,

22:28.394 --> 22:43.434
I think the only progress you could see was your 
daily reports of the ratio between how many we

22:28.394 --> 22:43.434
killed and how many we got killed. The Vietnamese 
War or the war at that time, whether you were in

22:44.035 --> 22:56.612
Cambodia or North Vietnam, wherever it may be that 
they were fighting at, there was no front lines

22:44.035 --> 22:56.612
like in World War II. You couldn't measure on the 
ground. One day you might own it, that night he owns

22:58.884 --> 23:00.986
it. There was nothing that could say, okay, on this 
parallel, 38th parallel, this is all ours behind

23:02.708 --> 23:10.537
us and that's all theirs in front. The only thing 
you could really measure in is how much equipment

23:10.918 --> 23:23.612
you captured, how much you blew up, how many people 
you killed, how many people you lost, that you got

23:10.918 --> 23:23.612
wounded, that you got your own people that got 
killed. Not necessarily this time, but any time

23:23.761 --> 23:36.075
during your tours, were you aware of the so-called 
statistical juggling in body counts, kill

23:23.761 --> 23:36.075
ratios, and lost equipment? No, I never heard 
anything about that until after I got back from

23:37.257 --> 23:43.444
Vietnam, even the second time. I do know that we 
reported everything that we killed. We may have

23:50.552 --> 23:53.295
not reported everything that we had captured. uh 
we kept some of the stuff back for ourselves

23:54.068 --> 24:22.557
everything that that you capture uh had to be 
turned in and in some cases we captured american

23:54.068 --> 24:22.557
equipment and we decided that the no use report in 
american equipment we captured because we can use

23:54.068 --> 24:22.557
it ourselves and equipment was very hard to get and 
if we got american radio or or something that that

23:54.068 --> 24:22.557
we could use we didn't report it being captured 
because every time you reported something being

24:22.942 --> 24:31.633
captured, somebody in Saigon on the Vietnamese 
side of the house wanted you to turn it in so there's

24:22.942 --> 24:31.633
something more that you've done. So we never 
turned in anything that was American that we could

24:32.354 --> 24:36.159
use. We just told them what we didn't want to have. 
You couldn't keep any of the captured equipment

24:40.705 --> 24:43.408
yourself, supposedly.

24:46.051 --> 24:52.780
Again, talking about the training, was the U.S. 
Army training Arvin in American tactics? or in

24:53.468 --> 24:56.853
guerrilla warfare? The units that I were with, we 
were training them as infantrymen, I would say

24:57.374 --> 25:21.771
American standards, because I'd been a training 
commander of units in the United States, and we

24:57.374 --> 25:21.771
tailored the training to fighting in the jungle, 
but most of the training that we were doing was, I

24:57.374 --> 25:21.771
felt, the American way of doing things. Now, I'm 
saying this because I was with an infantry

25:22.409 --> 25:27.217
training unit. Now, there were other units in 
Vietnam, American Ranger units, American

25:27.237 --> 25:38.736
Special Forces, which were doing their style of 
training with Vietnamese units. And sure, they

25:39.176 --> 25:43.704
trained them as Rangers and guerrilla warfare and 
what have you. But my people that we were training

25:43.724 --> 25:49.513
were straight infantry, and we were training as 
infantry. using a combination of firepower and

25:50.017 --> 26:01.033
maneuver, and kind of tailored that to the 
jungle-type warfare. Okay. What was the American

26:05.780 --> 26:10.828
morale like at this time during Tet, throughout 
the ranks?

26:14.413 --> 26:19.821
Well, again, that's hard for me to say what the 
overall American morale was, because Again, I was

26:20.257 --> 26:26.043
only one of me and one sergeant, and he was a senior 
sergeant. He was an E-8, which is the second

26:26.143 --> 26:32.670
highest sergeant that you can have in the Army. And 
our morale was good. We were very pleased with what

26:34.813 --> 26:36.935
we were doing. We felt we were winning. I really 
couldn't tell you what the morale of the other

26:40.879 --> 26:49.048
American units, because we didn't get to see too 
many American units in that time. I guess because

26:50.176 --> 26:52.438
we had done real well. I feel that we'd done real 
well pushing them out of Saigon and areas that the

26:52.498 --> 26:58.604
morale must have been high. I never heard anybody 
say it wasn't, but again, I didn't see it myself. It

27:04.310 --> 27:06.852
was just me and the other Viennese. As far as I'm 
concerned, our morale was high because we were

27:07.533 --> 27:10.055
doing pretty good. Did Tet prove anything to you at 
the time about the determination of the North

27:12.057 --> 27:18.023
Vietnamese

27:20.956 --> 27:38.939
Yeah, I felt that they really tried, the North 
Vietnamese, really tried to put a black eye on the

27:20.956 --> 27:38.939
American-South Vietnamese relationship, and I 
think they really underestimated the will of the

27:20.956 --> 27:38.939
South Vietnamese at that time.

27:41.783 --> 27:44.787
I really felt that South Vietnamese and the 
American unit And I say American units. We also had

27:46.445 --> 27:48.828
over there other units from other countries. We 
had the Korean White Horse Division, which was a

27:48.848 --> 27:55.777
very strong division, and you had other countries 
involved. I think they underestimated the

27:56.458 --> 28:02.807
combined firepower of the Americans and other 
Allied forces over there. I thought we were doing

28:04.149 --> 28:06.112
real well in 1068. Okay.

28:10.237 --> 28:13.542
Not specifically with your first tour or just 
anything. Looking back at Vietnam, I'd like to see

28:14.551 --> 28:20.917
if you could evaluate military personnel. Did you 
ever feel the military was top-heavy in Vietnam?

28:28.305 --> 28:34.952
Well,

28:28.305 --> 28:34.952
when you talk about top-heavy, you're talking 
about senior officers. I didn't feel that way.

28:38.495 --> 28:44.001
I've heard stories about it, but again, here, what 
I personally saw... We were generally short

28:44.858 --> 28:46.560
personnel. I did notice, though, and you talk to 
any infantry soldier on the ground, that if you had

28:48.882 --> 29:10.986
a pretty good battle going on and you had a couple 
battalions involved, you had a whole bunch of

28:48.882 --> 29:10.986
helicopters flying around and you would have 
either a battalion commander and division

28:48.882 --> 29:10.986
commanders and a bunch of staff officers. 
Everybody would want to go see what's going on. And

29:13.242 --> 29:18.889
you would have more helicopters flying around of 
higher ranking people watching the show. And

29:19.510 --> 29:24.396
everybody's trying to give the infantry command 
on the ground guidance on how to do it. And you

29:24.416 --> 29:31.085
didn't lack for anybody telling you what they 
thought when you had something going on. But I

29:31.926 --> 29:36.051
wouldn't say it was top heavy, but you had so many 
different groups over there. You had your

29:37.493 --> 29:41.798
division people, and you had your staff people, 
and you had regional people. I served in Korea

29:42.385 --> 29:49.875
twice, not during time of war, and you had all 
different types of groups over there, too. You had

29:49.915 --> 29:57.225
your combined staff, and you had your American 
staff, the United Nations staff. By the time you

29:57.505 --> 30:03.773
get all these staffs, same thing in Vietnam, by the 
time you had all these staffs of people, you had a

29:57.505 --> 30:03.773
lot of people running around.

30:06.697 --> 30:10.502
Recently, I read a book by Philip Caputo called The 
Rumor of War. And he was talking about a problem

30:11.444 --> 30:18.033
with fragging of officers, unexplained deaths. 
Have you ever heard of evidence of that? Yeah. Not

30:23.420 --> 30:24.341
my first tour. I wasn't with any Americans to speak 
of. But my second time in 101st Airborne, they've

30:28.387 --> 30:32.613
had that.

30:34.355 --> 30:39.662
I think you might remember a Life magazine article 
that came out where a West Point officer, for that

30:40.115 --> 30:50.548
matter, had decided not to go on a mission because 
they took a vote among the soldiers of that company

30:40.115 --> 30:50.548
and decided they weren't going to go on a mission. 
That's unheard of, not only a West Point officer,

30:51.389 --> 30:58.819
but unheard of any officer that would take a vote in 
a unit to find out they were going on a mission. The

30:59.840 --> 31:02.904
military is democratic, but not that democratic. 
But, yeah, I heard of it, I think, At that time, when

31:08.093 --> 31:19.087
I was in 101st, there was a court-martial going on 
where some soldier threw a grenade into one of his

31:08.093 --> 31:19.087
company commander's tents. There was a lot of 
drugs wrapped up into it, too. Drugs in Vietnam.

31:25.415 --> 31:31.182
And I was over there the second time in 1970, in 
101st Airborne. Drugs were pretty easy to get. The

31:34.786 --> 31:37.830
North Vietnamese made available drugs at no cost. 
The soldier wanted to get drugs and the commander

31:41.943 --> 31:46.170
wasn't really checking it. It was awful hard. We 
had urinalysis tests and everything else. Drugs

31:51.859 --> 31:55.004
were readily available and if they wanted it, they 
got it. It was awful hard to control. What impact do

31:59.632 --> 32:02.637
you feel that the short rotation of command in 
Vietnam, and the short tours that the men had, do

32:03.258 --> 32:11.128
you feel like that had any impact on that? Yeah, I 
did. I did the same thing. I had a year there and a

32:14.171 --> 32:18.837
year back here, and I went back over for another 
year. I really felt that the normal soldier,

32:20.139 --> 32:32.033
meaning the privates and the specialists, and you 
running out of tape? Yeah, privates and

32:32.283 --> 32:36.647
specialists and the people that are actually 
fighting. A year is a long time we fight out in the

32:36.687 --> 32:40.791
trees. And they would try to pull them in every two 
or three months and what have you and give them some

32:41.352 --> 32:53.423
type of relax and recuperation. But we were having 
commanders who were a commander or a staff officer

32:53.443 --> 33:00.670
for six months, then go out and be a commander for 
six months. and I didn't think that worked and I

33:01.240 --> 33:29.121
think the military probably thought it didn't 
work either because I think near the end they were

33:01.240 --> 33:29.121
cutting that out but the

33:01.240 --> 33:29.121
being a commander just for six months it's hard to 
get your feet on the ground even in civilian life to

33:01.240 --> 33:29.121
do something for six months and go do something 
else for six months time you learn how to do it

33:01.240 --> 33:29.121
you're gone and I felt in the officer wise on 
different staff positions and command positions

33:30.029 --> 33:35.535
If you're going to put him over there as commander, 
put him over there for the full tour, not just six

33:30.029 --> 33:35.535
months. But the soldier, the private on the 
ground, I don't think he could take it for a year of

33:35.555 --> 33:42.182
steady out in the jungle fighting. Some didn't. 
Did you believe, as you hinted before, and like

33:46.827 --> 33:57.518
Curtis LeMay of the Strategic Air Command, that 
bombing escalation was the way to win the war?

33:57.538 --> 33:59.580
Yeah, I felt that way. that if you got their 
supplies from the Ho Chi Minh Trail and you took the

34:00.168 --> 34:11.059
war home to their homeland, then you would win. We 
did the same thing in World War II. We bombed

34:13.582 --> 34:16.245
certain areas of Europe off the face of the earth. 
I've been to them now, and you would never know it,

34:17.206 --> 34:29.719
but areas like Mannheim, Germany, and Worms, 
Germany, and Dusseldorf and a few of those places,

34:17.206 --> 34:29.719
it was just leveled. I think we showed using the 
atomic bomb, Nagasaki and Hiroshima, that when

34:30.425 --> 34:53.457
you unleash that type of firepower, I'm not saying 
we should have dropped the atomic bomb in Vietnam,

34:30.425 --> 34:53.457
but you leash a lot of firepower on the enemy, they 
may think twice about whether they want to

34:30.425 --> 34:53.457
continue this.

34:53.477 --> 34:59.385
How did the U.S. military plan to win the hearts and 
minds of the people through destruction? Yeah.

35:04.364 --> 35:15.158
When you think about that, we used to joke about it 
somewhat, that how do you, just what you were

35:04.364 --> 35:15.158
saying, how do you win the hearts and minds of the 
people by killing them? When you brought in your

35:15.779 --> 35:30.418
forces to attack certain areas in the South, and 
that's what you were doing because you were

35:15.779 --> 35:30.418
fighting the war in the South, if you had approval 
from the South Vietnamese government or from the

35:15.779 --> 35:30.418
regional area, to do bombing runs, and it happened 
to be some friendly Vietnamese families in there,

35:30.888 --> 35:40.396
you really don't win much when you blow them up. And 
when you go into their homes and what have you and

35:40.416 --> 36:00.574
burn them down, whether you might think they're, 
or you've got reports that they were sympathizers

35:40.416 --> 36:00.574
or not, and you cause this destruction, it was 
awful hard to win the hearts and minds and some of

36:01.043 --> 36:09.396
the things we did, but again here you had so many 
problems of identifying who were the players.

36:10.317 --> 36:14.683
Everybody looked alike, everybody wore the same 
uniform to speak of. During the day this

36:16.706 --> 36:27.743
individual you might know was a real top-notch 
South Vietnamese supporter, a Nike, the Griller,

36:16.706 --> 36:27.743
against you. You had children on the road that 
would wave at you during the day and at night throw a

36:28.533 --> 36:33.099
grenade in your vehicle. So it was awful hard to 
identify the players. And any time you got a war,

36:37.224 --> 36:44.314
some innocent people were going to get killed. I 
find it interesting that you were an advisor with

36:45.335 --> 36:49.461
an entire battalion with you. Did you ever have any 
briefings, both in your first or maybe your second

36:49.481 --> 36:55.148
term, on ways to We were sent to school prior to 
going to Vietnam. The sergeant, who I didn't know

37:03.503 --> 37:10.471
until I got over there, but he had attended special 
courses that were conducted at Fort Benning,

37:03.503 --> 37:10.471
Georgia. I went to a special officer's course at 
Fort Benning. Because of things moving along,

37:17.219 --> 37:22.045
they didn't teach us much how to speak the language 
over there. We were given an interpreter. But I

37:24.912 --> 37:25.853
lucked out. The individual I was advising spoke 
very good English. So we got along very well. For

37:33.663 --> 37:37.568
that matter, we would use the same 
communications. In some cases, I'd get up in the

37:37.648 --> 37:40.912
helicopter and talk to him back and forth on the 
ground. And so we had no problems in

37:41.834 --> 37:43.816
communication.

37:46.600 --> 37:53.248
Yeah, I did go to school for about a month on how to go 
in and how to try I don't know how much you know about

37:53.870 --> 37:59.857
Orientals, but you can never tell them anything. 
You cannot tell an Oriental to do anything and

37:59.877 --> 38:03.341
expect it to be done. You have to talk to them. And I 
speak from experience, since I have adopted two

38:06.224 --> 38:10.288
Koreans. You can never tell them anything. You 
have to make them think it's their idea. So yes, we

38:16.175 --> 38:23.303
had some problems trying to win the hearts and 
minds of the people. You try to do it with good

38:23.553 --> 38:25.775
works. You had a lot of American civilians over 
there that were from the State Department, what

38:26.536 --> 38:40.230
have you, of coming in with different teams to 
assist them in sanitation, to assist them in

38:26.536 --> 38:40.230
agricultural. I worked in this battalion at 
night. I worked on certain nights as an instructor

38:43.173 --> 38:52.463
trying to teach the kids how to speak English.

38:53.050 --> 38:57.295
getting funds to build schools for them. We were 
receiving in from our American ships equipment,

38:58.257 --> 39:18.383
and the ships had what's called dunnage aborted 
boards and big two-by-fours and logging and what

38:58.257 --> 39:18.383
have you that helped the ship keep the equipment in 
one place as it was coming across, and they would

38:58.257 --> 39:18.383
take all this stuff and throw it up on the dock. We 
worked out a deal where we could pick some of this

39:19.284 --> 39:22.568
stuff up and we'd build a school for them. I said, we 
didn't build it. The sergeant and I didn't build

39:24.439 --> 39:25.581
it. But we got the equipment. They picked it up. 
They did the work. And all this was trying to help

39:29.767 --> 39:37.259
them in the sanitation and the schooling and what 
have you. And I thought it did some good. The people

39:41.847 --> 39:47.015
that you got to know and the people that you worked 
with, I felt we did real well with. But the people

39:47.135 --> 39:50.901
that were on the borderline It was awful hard. 
Sometimes they just were looking for a handout and

39:52.524 --> 39:58.854
forget the rest of it. Um,

39:58.874 --> 40:14.678
moving on to some other things, some other 
aspects, um, do you feel Lyndon Johnson's refusal

39:58.874 --> 40:14.678
to call on reserve troops to stay? You mean, um... 
Later

40:14.698 --> 40:20.567
in the year. I don't know. I don't know what 
President Johnson had in mind. I don't know if we

40:28.153 --> 40:30.715
could have done any more with any more troops over 
there. We had so many people running around over

40:32.336 --> 40:34.598
there now. I still fall back on the same thing that 
you just said a few minutes ago about General May. I

40:41.564 --> 40:46.208
thought General May was right in what he was trying 
to say was carry the war. That's what it was. To the

40:48.771 --> 40:50.352
north. through the American Air Force, and you can 
have as many people as you want. You need to have as

40:56.421 --> 41:05.293
many guns as you want, as many tanks as you want, but 
as long as you stay fighting in one little area, it

40:56.421 --> 41:05.293
could go on forever, which it did.

41:12.402 --> 41:13.083
What would you like to say? No, that's good. Could 
you please describe your second tour of duty,

41:15.509 --> 41:21.256
specifically in Vietnam and Hawaii? Okay. The 
second tour I had, I left Vietnam in 1968,

41:24.399 --> 41:42.681
April of 1968, and I was reassigned that time to 
Berlin, Germany, as a battalion executive

41:24.399 --> 41:42.681
officer. and i served over there about a year and a 
half of a three-year tour by the way and i got sent

41:43.657 --> 42:13.123
back to vietnam that's the way it was going for us 
infantry types you would stay about a year or so

41:43.657 --> 42:13.123
somewhere and then go back again and the second 
time i went back over and i have some background in

41:43.657 --> 42:13.123
logistics and i had no idea what i was doing i was 
just being sent back to vietnam again and when i got

41:43.657 --> 42:13.123
into The center, where all the replacements come 
in, they said, well, you're going up to the 101st

42:14.167 --> 42:23.619
Airborne, which was located up around Hue, 
Vietnam. Now, the 101st at that time had changed

42:24.260 --> 42:31.970
over and became air mobile, which we were, for the 
most part, with helicopters. You had some ground

42:32.590 --> 42:37.276
crews, but for the most part, we were moving from 
point A to point B by helicopters. Very few trucks.

42:41.362 --> 42:44.005
So I went up there, and I found out that I was the 
operation officer for the 101st Airborne

42:44.643 --> 42:51.091
Division Support Command. Support Command means 
just what it means, is that its responsibility was

42:51.932 --> 43:05.989
not really the fighting of anything, but 
supporting the soldiers, the battalions and

42:51.932 --> 43:05.989
divisions that were out in the field carrying on 
the war. My job as operation officer was twofold.

43:14.377 --> 43:16.199
And this is where I got in this six-month deal. The 
first six months, I was in charge of a forward

43:17.501 --> 43:24.551
service support company, and I'll come back to 
that and tell you about that. And the second six

43:24.591 --> 43:32.422
months, I went back as the operation officer 
itself for the division, the support command

43:24.591 --> 43:32.422
operation. The first six months was something 
like a company commander of a unit that was

43:32.922 --> 43:43.557
assigned to one of the battalions, We had under us a 
helicopter pad. We had a food storage facility. We

43:52.444 --> 43:55.688
had water, fuel.

43:59.091 --> 44:08.801
We had responsibility for coordination for all 
air traffic of supplies for that battalion or

43:59.091 --> 44:08.801
division, whatever they be. In my case, I was 
assigned with a I had three battalions who were

44:12.815 --> 44:15.419
taken care of. And whenever they went into combat 
or normal everyday operation, we were

44:15.439 --> 44:22.229
responsible for providing them the support. And 
you'd go to staff meetings and find out what they

44:23.171 --> 44:30.001
wanted and make sure that everything got from 
point A to point B for them. I did that for six

44:30.902 --> 44:34.908
months, and then I went back to our division 
headquarters. The first six months was in a place

44:35.429 --> 44:41.218
called Fubat, and it had a MASH hospital in that 
area, and we were responsible for that. not not for

44:42.245 --> 45:10.834
the dust off helicopters but just to make sure that 
they had their supplies to get from point a to point

44:42.245 --> 45:10.834
b when when the wounded were called or when they 
called for helicopters for wounded we didn't do

44:42.245 --> 45:10.834
anything in that area we just made sure that the 
helicopters themselves got their fuel and all

44:42.245 --> 45:10.834
that and the pilot had a place to live and so but 
anyway uh the second six months i went back and

44:42.245 --> 45:10.834
became a i say went back to this was a division 
headquarters I was the operation officer for the

45:11.843 --> 45:22.840
entire division, which was responsibility for 
all these forward service support companies,

45:11.843 --> 45:22.840
which were about four of them. And then we were also 
responsible for some of the security for the Camp

45:23.941 --> 45:32.414
Eagle, which was division headquarters. So in one 
case, I was there out in the field doing the

45:33.235 --> 45:41.007
commander of one of the small units, and then the 
second time, or the the next six months I was in

45:41.577 --> 46:08.597
charge of all these little outfits company 
outfits to coordinate everybody's work and for

45:41.577 --> 46:08.597
the most part I never really got involved in 
anything like fighting like I got in the first time

45:41.577 --> 46:08.597
I was dealing with the American units all the time 
and we were always on the radio or on the phone or we

45:41.577 --> 46:08.597
were making sure supplies got from point a to point 
b and I didn't hardly even see any Vietnamese

46:09.218 --> 46:28.099
soldiers, or we were just, I was so involved in 
supplies and resupplying and what have you that I

46:09.218 --> 46:28.099
could have been anywhere and not even know the war 
was going on unless somebody was shooting at me,

46:09.218 --> 46:28.099
because I was not really involved in the tactics 
end of it. I was just involved in getting the

46:28.399 --> 46:33.585
supplies to whoever wanted them.

46:35.948 --> 46:38.230
I'm not certain if you could answer this, Do you 
know what was responsible for the most casualties

46:38.699 --> 46:48.072
by the Vietnamese attacks? What caused their 
casualties? You mean the North Vietnamese

46:49.835 --> 46:54.501
attacks on the Americans? Right.

46:58.947 --> 47:05.617
Oh, no, I don't know any one single thing that 
caused the most casualties. I know that they were A

47:08.416 --> 47:37.005
lot of the American soldiers or the Vietnamese 
have a, South Vietnamese had a weird feeling when

47:08.416 --> 47:37.005
you start walking through the jungles because 
they had different types of traps and what they

47:08.416 --> 47:37.005
called pungy sticks which is a sharp stick with 
poison on them of some sort and they had different

47:08.416 --> 47:37.005
type of holes that you'd fall into and like cut you 
in two with different type of steel wires and

47:08.416 --> 47:37.005
whatever. I don't think there's any one thing that 
you can say that killed more Americans or more

47:37.711 --> 47:47.027
Vietnamese than anything else. It was a 
combination of everything.

47:52.557 --> 47:59.449
Were there ever any standing orders that you were 
aware that when evacuating, when you did that?

48:00.610 --> 48:02.493
where helicopters were refused to go? Or was it 
just an individual basis in a combat situation

48:02.513 --> 48:12.428
that you couldn't come to their relief, to take out 
the relief? You're talking about American or

48:12.448 --> 48:14.551
South Vietnamese? American. No, I've never heard 
of any. I've known a lot of American and also South

48:18.677 --> 48:28.712
Vietnamese helicopter pilots, and they were a 
dedicated bunch. I've seen them go in or been told

48:30.327 --> 48:41.803
about it or a known pilot that had gone in where they 
were told not to go in because probably they would

48:30.327 --> 48:41.803
not have got out. Or they've gone into places where 
it was probably the chances of getting out was

48:41.823 --> 48:49.153
almost nil when they got in and got back out again. I 
think it was just the opposite. I don't know of any

48:51.716 --> 48:59.507
officer that ever refused to go in and take anybody 
out.
