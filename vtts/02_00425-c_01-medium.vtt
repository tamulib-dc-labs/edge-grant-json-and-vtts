00:01.853 --> 00:04.577
Okay, to be back at... The greatest honor you've 
ever had is to be at A&M College and do the review.

00:07.982 --> 00:08.643
Now, when was this? In May of 1955,

00:11.026 --> 00:18.777
when I took the review. That's one of the greatest 
honors I've ever had at A&M College. Tell me about

00:24.806 --> 00:25.407
it. Well, I was up there, and the commandant, I 
forget his name now, don't come to me, told me that

00:32.583 --> 00:35.668
he wanted me to take that review. And he instructed 
me on what to salute. Of course, I was very kind to

00:43.442 --> 00:48.911
you with the salute, but I took the instruction 
from him because everybody has their own ground

00:43.442 --> 00:48.911
rules. So I appeared there at the right time and 
took the review. I was in uniform, a lot of people

00:54.681 --> 00:58.067
there, and they introduced me and all that. That 
was quite an honor.

01:04.668 --> 01:11.198
It was quite an honor after having thought back 
when that guy told you, don't you come on this

01:04.668 --> 01:11.198
campus, you're not allowed here. Yeah, right.

01:15.285 --> 01:17.308
And so then you came on as a general. Well, that's 
all right. But anyhow, as I say, I'm proud of A&M,

01:19.972 --> 01:24.780
I'm proud of the Marine Corps, I'm proud to love 
people. See, if God just wanted you on this race,

01:26.195 --> 01:29.201
he's all powerful. He'd let you run in. What the 
hell are you going to do by yourself? Anyhow. Was

01:34.971 --> 01:40.000
there anything else that you think that we should 
talk about as far as your career or your life is

01:34.971 --> 01:40.000
concerned? Or do you think we pretty well covered 
it? Well, all you're interested in, you're not

01:43.727 --> 01:48.456
interested in sidebar stuff. what you accomplish 
as a civilian. You want that being an Aggie and in

01:50.761 --> 01:54.807
your service. I think I've given it all to you, but 
if anything else comes, you know, there are a lot of

01:55.569 --> 02:02.660
things.

02:06.326 --> 02:12.115
You take this ride business, that thing was 
something. I hid, and when I told my commanding

02:12.483 --> 02:23.115
general that morning at 4 o'clock when he relieved 
my battalion, I commenced crying to him, saying,

02:12.483 --> 02:23.115
look, this is the first time I've ever been king. 
And he told me, he said, you better get on and quit

02:24.416 --> 02:27.860
thinking about being a king in your battalion. 
You've got a new job to do, and get on and get with it.

02:31.745 --> 02:35.349
General Lawson, 4 o'clock in the morning. So I went 
on and got with it and did his job. They never had a

02:39.803 --> 02:44.471
Provo Mark with 47 people in the headquarters, 
stockades.

02:47.376 --> 02:52.966
I had Army personnel, I had Navy personnel, Marine 
personnel. It was a job. Every now and then, I

02:55.951 --> 02:59.858
remember one time an officer came up there. He'd 
been put on report by not having the rat guards on

03:01.321 --> 03:04.967
his ship when he landed. He commenced telling me 
about he graduated the Naval Academy, never been

03:06.938 --> 03:12.703
on a report in his life, and all of that. So I had to 
answer him. I said, I didn't put you on a report. You

03:16.827 --> 03:18.368
put yourself on a report. I said, because back at 
Pearl Harbor, all those instructions are telling

03:18.788 --> 03:27.876
you how to get into these waters and what to do when 
you dock a ship. So I didn't put you on any report.

03:31.279 --> 03:33.121
You put yourself on a report. What did he say to 
that? He just hung his head and left.

03:40.587 --> 03:41.689
That's a word to tell you, wasn't it? Because those 
marines right down there with the damn camera,

03:42.129 --> 03:47.036
boom, boom, boom. No ship guards. What's the name 
of the ship? Bring all the reports, bring it all in.

03:53.104 --> 03:54.947
I can't do nothing but after it comes in.

04:01.496 --> 04:02.918
Then there's another guy came in there. He was 
charged with stealing photographic papers.

04:07.148 --> 04:08.611
Because I never been on a report in my life. I said, 
well, you goddamn stupid son of a gun. Don't you

04:10.977 --> 04:13.383
realize that that's not your property? Don't you 
realize that that belongs to the Air Force? Well, I

04:18.234 --> 04:19.778
see everybody else doing it. I said, but you got 
caught. What do you say to that? He didn't like it.

04:24.750 --> 04:25.892
He didn't like getting caught. Anderson, look, I 
appreciate you coming and all like that, and we'll

04:26.413 --> 04:30.841
keep in touch. Okay, great. If we feel about having 
another interview, just let me know. Okay, thanks

04:34.468 --> 04:35.790
a lot, General. But I've got to get my wife back in. 
She's been in that hospital.
