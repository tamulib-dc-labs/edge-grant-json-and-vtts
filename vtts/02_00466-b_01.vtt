WEBVTT

00:03.372 --> 00:05.394
Okay, so you were... So we were in the Admiralty 
Islands, and the 1st Cavalry had just recently

00:05.414 --> 00:11.840
cleaned it up. We had a large naval base there. And

00:17.945 --> 00:33.379
from there we prepared one of our companies,

00:17.945 --> 00:33.379
Company B, I believe, to carry the 1st Cavalry in. 
So

00:34.270 --> 00:43.258
you were preparing then to go into Leyte? Right. 
The invasion of the Philippines. Right, we got

00:46.982 --> 00:48.443
them ready. And you were basically under Douglas 
MacArthur then? Yes, we were a separate

00:52.527 --> 00:56.410
battalion, an orphan. Really, we were under 
General Kruger, Sixth Army.

01:03.548 --> 01:13.538
So we then, from there, the rest of the battalion 
shipped to Atape, New Guinea. And see, each

01:13.558 --> 01:22.768
division had an amphibious kit, which was 
composed of a few amphibious tractors. And then

01:24.310 --> 01:31.497
the rest of the battalion

01:24.310 --> 01:31.497
took over those amphibious kits in the 43rd 
Division. which was National Guard Division from

01:32.810 --> 01:43.043
Maine to

01:32.810 --> 01:43.043
Vermont.

01:43.063 --> 01:51.934
And we trained their people and ours for invasion, 
and they got

01:43.063 --> 01:51.934
in government. Was that invasion the first action 
that you saw, or were you still trained? It was the

01:57.982 --> 01:59.804
first formal action. I'd seen informal action. 
What do you mean, that bomb? Well, there was a few

02:03.649 --> 02:06.773
stray Japs still. You don't kill them all at one 
time and stuff like that, but it was very minor

02:08.255 --> 02:13.962
stuff. And then we carried the... So you were in on 
the L.A.T. Gulf? No, I was not in on the L.A.T. Gulf.

02:21.091 --> 02:23.975
This one company was. The rest of the battalion 
carried the 43rd Division in on the Lingayen Gulf.

02:30.370 --> 02:33.454
which was a larger operation. We carried the 4030 
and I was naval liaison for that. So were you on a

02:41.483 --> 02:43.846
ship then offshore? Yes, the regimental 
commander of the attacking regiment and myself

02:43.866 --> 02:57.762
about 2 30 in the morning went aboard a subchaser 
and by then this LCI, landing craft infantry. Are

03:02.656 --> 03:04.418
you familiar with those? Small ships. But they 
mounted rockets on decks. And he and I went into

03:09.464 --> 03:16.132
1500 yards and marked the line of departure. We 
were in the LCVP. And then the rocket ships came in

03:19.757 --> 03:24.863
and fired their rockets. And then we marked the 
line of departure for the amphibious tractor

03:27.037 --> 03:43.892
waves, which there were just several battalions 
of amphibious tractors, all those troops coming

03:27.037 --> 03:43.892
in. And as soon as the second wave passed, then he 
and I went ashore. And then I immediately started

03:50.278 --> 03:56.824
to dash across the beach and immediately started 
pulling people together. You break down in small

03:57.428 --> 04:02.895
units, and you try to get them back up.

04:06.800 --> 04:21.098
See, by then, the

04:06.800 --> 04:21.098
Japanese had begun to pull back and let you land, 
and then try to knock you off the beach. And that's

04:21.118 --> 04:24.482
basically what they tried to do there. In some 
areas.

04:37.049 --> 04:53.187
As we compared in later notes, and I prefer this to 
be off the record,

04:37.049 --> 04:53.187
when the first Cavs got out of their vehicles, they 
just got in like hunters and started out. 43rd got

04:54.820 --> 04:55.921
out. It took about 30 minutes to get them up off the 
ground. But some of them see our way.

05:05.292 --> 05:05.993
I'm not sure.

05:09.197 --> 05:10.218
Training perhaps.

05:12.681 --> 05:21.711
But anyway, they misused some of our M50s tractors 
because they're primarily beach vehicles. They

05:21.731 --> 05:22.212
have maybe half an inch of armor across the front. 
Not very much. They carried some of them down the

05:28.760 --> 05:31.725
road acting as tanks. We had a .35 caliber machine 
gun each one. And they got some boresighted holes

05:37.453 --> 05:47.508
from 37 millimeter Jap guns and stuck others in 
rice paddies and stuff like that. Not in every

05:48.329 --> 05:49.431
case, but.

05:54.288 --> 05:59.476
And as the XO, down as the XO, were you in a command 
post then? Yes. Or were you off in the field? You

06:02.961 --> 06:04.263
were right behind the lines, probably. At that 
time, I was hiding behind a sand dune and trying to

06:04.283 --> 06:22.692
get control,

06:04.283 --> 06:22.692
because we had very little control until things 
began to move in, because we had several waves of

06:04.283 --> 06:22.692
people running in.

06:26.671 --> 06:33.238
And I was neither afraid,

06:26.671 --> 06:33.238
scared, excited, or nervous. All of them rolled up 
into one. You can condition a man's mind.

06:42.288 --> 06:47.974
So in other words, you felt that the training was 
very beneficial. Oh, definitely. And an

06:50.777 --> 06:55.362
interesting thing,

06:50.777 --> 06:55.362
there wasn't a, See, there was been a heavy 
preliminary bombardment by the Navy. I don't

07:01.304 --> 07:10.856
believe there was a square foot of beach if there 
wasn't some shell breakage.

07:10.876 --> 07:18.825
Although I'm sure they did very little damage to 
the Japanese who had pulled back.

07:18.845 --> 07:20.347
But the Kamikaze is popular. Tell me about 
Kamikaze. Well, we had some 500 ships that we got in

07:23.168 --> 07:30.018
harbor.

07:30.038 --> 07:47.663
And one

07:30.038 --> 07:47.663
of them, unfortunately, buried himself in the 
hold of a freighter, which carried our beer and

07:30.038 --> 07:47.663
ration. So did the freighter sink? I assume it did. 
But I think it was a Black Widow, I believe

07:54.775 --> 08:11.317
it was a P-61 Black Widow,

07:54.775 --> 08:11.317
almost like a P-51 night fighter. It came over from 
the ocean. And none of us had ever been

08:17.666 --> 08:22.993
indoctrinated with a Black Widow. And the whole 
fleet opened

08:23.598 --> 08:33.370
up, freighters and all, and there was all kind of 
flak falling on us. We were crawling under coconut

08:33.611 --> 08:37.436
logs. And just as he got to the horizon, he got a 
fuselage burst. And

08:44.044 --> 08:48.369
he went. And of course, we were harassed by 
Japanese fighters, not necessarily kamikazes.

08:57.276 --> 09:04.563
Did the Japanese have any artillery to shoot at 
that time? Yes, they had captured an 11-inch

09:04.583 --> 09:19.558
crack mounted gun, and they had it around the bay up 
in the mountain. And we referred to him as Piscol

09:21.192 --> 09:31.163
Charlie, because about 11 o'clock at night, 
they'd run it out. The adjutant and I had a foxhole

09:31.183 --> 09:39.491
that was about four feet square with sandbags 
around, real comfortable. In an Amtrak, you can

09:39.571 --> 09:43.516
carry an awful lot of equipment, including a cot 
and sponsors. So we had rather developed

09:45.498 --> 09:47.740
foxholes. And we'd stand there in our underwear 
and boots and helmet. And around the bay, we could

09:54.871 --> 09:57.454
see a flash. And we could count 21 seconds and duck 
down, and we'd get simultaneously the sound of the

09:59.538 --> 10:14.240
muzzle burst, the whine, and the explosion. One, 
two, three. And And I'd say, Bill, how far away do

10:19.698 --> 10:23.182
you think that was? About a mile? Well, I'm afraid 
it's closer than that. I said, half a mile? I'm

10:27.547 --> 10:28.848
afraid it's closer than that. All right, 300 
yards. Yeah. How'd they knock that gun off?

10:38.259 --> 10:49.131
My classmate and very close friend by the name of 
Taylor, who was a company commander in the first

10:38.259 --> 10:49.131
camp, See, the first cab finally came on in.

10:55.431 --> 11:01.997
And we were visiting after the war up here, and he 
turned around. I tell him about the piss call.

11:04.059 --> 11:08.603
Charlie turned around his wife, Topsy, and said, 
you hear what the man's saying? See, we had a

11:09.985 --> 11:13.828
battalion of 155 guns. Every time he'd fire, 
they'd fire a battalion salvo. But a gun is too flat

11:18.642 --> 11:23.851
a detector.

11:23.871 --> 11:25.975
And Taylor said, you hear what the man's saying? 
That I and my company had to take him by hand. So

11:32.706 --> 11:33.948
that's how they got him? They had to send the 
company up there? That was the first cab. Of

11:39.478 --> 11:41.922
course, there was a lot of Aggies in the first cab. 
Yeah. See, it was a square regiment still, even

11:42.807 --> 11:47.854
though we'd gone to Triangle Division. I mean, 
Square Division.

11:51.518 --> 11:55.263
Even though we'd gone to Triangle Division. Which 
I don't know whether that means anything to you or

11:55.283 --> 11:58.528
not. No. Well, before World War II, all our 
divisions were square. That was...

12:12.760 --> 12:17.047
four

12:12.760 --> 12:17.047
battalions each. And then they found out that the 
Triangle Division, which was three battalions

12:17.287 --> 12:26.361
each, was more flexible. Except in the armor, 
which all of the modern divisions have gone to, in

12:26.381 --> 12:39.882
the armor, to start out with, we had Combat Command 
A, Combat Command B, and the Reserve Command. And

12:41.870 --> 12:49.176
all they consisted of was the headquarters and 
headquarters companies. And then they had so many

12:49.196 --> 13:02.268
tank battalions, so many infantry battalions, 
and they attached to them the combat command for

12:49.196 --> 13:02.268
each individual operation they tailored them. 
Because if it were a heavily wooded country, not

13:02.288 --> 13:10.915
particularly suitable for tanks who were heavy on 
infantry, And the rest of the Army adopted it after

13:12.008 --> 13:15.694
the war. But prior to the war, I mean, during the 
war, they were trying to division. The troops were

13:21.463 --> 13:26.731
not attached to that regiment. They were a part of

13:26.751 --> 13:32.640
it, you see. Did you have any Filipinos with you, 
fighting alongside you? Not initially. But then

13:41.253 --> 13:47.179
it became our job to train the Philippine 
guerrillas.

13:50.823 --> 13:52.184
Poor job. Tough job. Can you describe it? Well, 
among other things, there were pockets of

13:54.627 --> 14:04.036
Japanese, including Japanese Marines. Unusual 
for a Japanese race when you had to be six feet tall

14:05.458 --> 14:09.842
to be a Marine. So we trained guerrillas the best we 
could to clean

14:11.780 --> 14:23.511
out those pockets.

14:23.531 --> 14:27.054
And they were strange people. One night, we were 
loading up some to go out. And as he got in the truck,

14:29.616 --> 14:33.059
he handed them a rifle. But this one said, but, sir, 
I did not join the Army to fight. I joined the Army to

14:39.365 --> 14:41.567
play in the land. They

14:42.222 --> 14:58.941
could be tough in certain situations,

14:42.222 --> 14:58.941
but they

14:42.222 --> 14:58.941
were not that well trained as a whole. It takes a 
long time to train that long. And they'd issue rice

15:03.386 --> 15:06.229
rations. They'd walk 10 miles back and say, the 
bowl's cracked.

15:12.023 --> 15:13.945
They just weren't very well trained. That was one 
of the major problems. Well, that was a problem.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.652
I'd say their temperament and so forth. They're 
not the world's greatest fighters in organized

15:20.672 --> 15:25.677
combat. Individuals,

15:25.697 --> 15:29.181
they might be. So we trained guerrillas to clean 
out those pockets, and I think finally cleaned

15:29.201 --> 15:37.290
most of them out. And they did or we did? Who cleaned 
most of them out? Both of us. They cleaned out a few.

15:43.561 --> 15:46.265
We cleaned out most of them. See, part of the thing 
had to swing up toward Baguio, if you ever heard of

15:46.285 --> 15:56.278
Baguio or not, but that was beautiful in the 
mountains. Not too long after that, I left the unit

15:56.298 --> 16:07.233
and went up as assistant G4, 1st

15:56.298 --> 16:07.233
Corps Headquarters. So I wasn't doing much 
fighting things. an awful lot of hard work.

16:17.250 --> 16:18.171
Now when was that? I don't know the date.

16:24.497 --> 16:26.039
Is this when you were promoted to major? No, I was 
promoted to major in 1942. Okay, so was this— Well,

16:29.622 --> 16:35.368
I was already— Okay, so you were a major at this 
time. Yeah. And I went up to

16:35.508 --> 16:41.734
System G4 by Corps. And

16:44.009 --> 16:59.344
we had

16:44.009 --> 16:59.344
a full colonel by the name of Tommy Sawyer. He was 
G4. He had been quartermaster.

17:06.891 --> 17:13.257
And when he became G4, there was a short, fat, 
27-year-old captain from Texas

17:15.312 --> 17:30.046
A&M

17:15.312 --> 17:30.046
assistant

17:15.312 --> 17:30.046
corps quartermaster. The best they could do in 
promoting a major, he was a whiz. He was a whiz. I

17:34.290 --> 17:34.891
can't remember the name now. But he was sharp. You 
don't become assistant corps quartermaster

17:35.271 --> 17:41.117
unless you're sharp. I don't know if you're 
familiar with what a corps is, but it's strictly a

17:41.570 --> 17:46.054
tactical avenue. We don't have any supply 
functions. Divisions have it. Army has it. But not

17:51.360 --> 17:52.360
corps. We're tactical. But

17:54.903 --> 18:06.494
I guess I was assistant G4 in charge of 
transportation and shipping. And I worked up

18:06.654 --> 18:10.378
there. See, then we would start planning the 
invasion of the Philippines. Were you in Manila at

18:13.773 --> 18:15.074
this time? Was that the headquarters? No, I was 
down in Rosales. I'd been to Manila. It was my

18:20.620 --> 18:21.981
sister outfit. I fought all the way through

18:23.022 --> 18:29.449
the whole thing. And did you start some of the 
planning? We had an operation called Operation

18:31.591 --> 18:40.821
Blacklist,

18:31.591 --> 18:40.821
which was the invasion of Japan. The main island is 
Cayuse,

18:42.573 --> 18:54.549
and this was a smaller island, Huntsville.

18:54.569 --> 19:01.459
And our plan was, it was cut by a river across it. The 
plan was two divisions here, one division here, a

19:01.479 --> 19:11.753
division in the regimental combat team in the 
floating reserve. What my job was as assistant G4,

19:13.741 --> 19:32.144
in the past, as divisions landed, they set up their 
dumps on the beach, ammunition dumps,

19:13.741 --> 19:32.144
quartermaster dumps, and so on and so forth. And 
then when they got too far inland and the Army came

19:32.164 --> 19:38.392
in, and the Army took them over, not Corps. That 
wasn't our function.

19:45.365 --> 19:53.376
And then the Army would not like exactly where they 
were, so it would be a big moving around this,

19:45.365 --> 19:53.376
moving around that. So my job in that was to, using 
aerial photographs, was to coordinate with Army

19:53.396 --> 20:13.465
above and divisions below so that we could 
mutually agree on the initial location of those

19:53.396 --> 20:13.465
dumps so Army could build on them without having to 
move. And then we were also getting our troop

20:15.537 --> 20:18.341
assignments. And

20:19.823 --> 20:25.851
I'd complain to Army G-4. I said, man, you switch 
these things around. He said, what are you

20:28.735 --> 20:31.079
complaining about? He said, we've already 
handled eight of them before we ever signed you

20:31.159 --> 20:36.827
one. Because they'd signed the 355th Engineer 
Firefighting Detachment. Two days later, it was

20:45.980 --> 20:48.022
transferred somewhere else. And then, an 
interesting thing, General N.S.P. Bull Swift was

20:56.393 --> 21:03.841
our corps commander and had come from the 1st Cav. 
earlier. And some Air Corps generals were trying

21:06.224 --> 21:12.612
to bet him $1,500,000 to warrant me over.

21:15.781 --> 21:25.653
And see, I was working from 8.30 in the morning 
until noon, and went and took a nap. And went to work

21:25.673 --> 21:37.668
about 2 and worked until about 5, and had a drink and 
supper, and then come back and worked about 7 or

21:25.673 --> 21:37.668
3.30 in the morning, seven days a week. And they 
were trying to bet that money that the war bill was,

21:37.688 --> 21:44.016
they knew about the atomic bomb, we didn't. And 
then suddenly

21:45.835 --> 21:53.463
VJ Day came. And that was about 5 o'clock in the 
afternoon when I found out about it. So I went to the

21:58.228 --> 22:09.901
officer's bunk and had a couple of drinks and then 
came back to work from invading Japan to the

21:58.228 --> 22:09.901
occupation of Japan. Then they split I-Corps into 
two groups, I-Corps Forward and I-Corps Rear. And

22:17.712 --> 22:34.700
they left Brigadier General James F. Collins, who 
was the Corps Artillery Commander, as Commander

22:17.712 --> 22:34.700
General High Court Rear, and left me back as G4 High 
Court Rear. And I have never worked with a minor

22:34.720 --> 22:39.689
person in my life. He was my ideal of a West Pointer. 
About six feet, two inches tall, handsome,

22:43.531 --> 22:52.981
slender, blue eyed, deep voice.

22:53.001 --> 22:59.849
And one of the finest persons I've ever worked with 
in my life. Anything I wanted, I was the one to see.

23:04.333 --> 23:07.657
Operations weren't doing anything. First place, 
I had to ship troops to Japan. I ended up shipping

23:12.708 --> 23:17.993
85,000 troops

23:12.708 --> 23:17.993
to Japan. And all of the problems. First place, we 
had two ports, Nagoya and another

23:22.098 --> 23:29.365
port. And I had to decide which one going in there 
and which one going in there. I had to depend on the

23:33.029 --> 23:41.297
Navy for bottoms to ship them in, APAs, AKAs, LCTs, 
LSTs. had to supervise all the landing

23:42.762 --> 23:46.667
operations. We had 22 beach points.

23:55.997 --> 24:04.047
Down on the beach, we had an engineer at Bolton 
Shore, West Point, a colonel in charge of it. And I

24:04.067 --> 24:11.115
went down there to him, and I said, Colonel, I'm the 
G4 I Corps Rear. I don't know what the hell I'm

24:11.753 --> 24:13.355
doing. I need some help. He said, what do you need? I 
said, well, could I get a road down here? He said,

24:21.187 --> 24:22.249
damn right. I said, Major, put him a road just like 
he wants. And I said, we're going to be doing

24:26.876 --> 24:30.622
24-hour operations. Is it possible to get some 
lighting? He said, yeah. I told another guy,

24:35.149 --> 24:38.554
whatever I want to do. because i went down and told 
him i needed help and

24:39.766 --> 25:08.102
we loaded sometimes 24 hours a day sometimes not 24 
hours a day it depended for how many months i'd

24:39.766 --> 25:08.102
guess 45 days

24:39.766 --> 25:08.102
see our we had these beach ones that lsts could come 
up We had to lighter things out to APA and AKAs. I

25:13.324 --> 25:25.717
don't know if you know the APA and the AKAs, the 
LSTs, but we always had some of these beach points

25:13.324 --> 25:25.717
knocked out because of sand building up. 
Sometimes we had two high tides today, so we'd

25:25.737 --> 25:37.870
bring in a ship on a high tide and take them back out 
on

25:25.737 --> 25:37.870
the next up tide. And we could do two, sometimes 
during periods, and sometimes only one,

25:38.322 --> 25:44.527
depending on tides. So we were pretty well 24-hour 
operation. But see, you'd plan all these things. I

25:51.733 --> 26:00.681
had a

25:51.733 --> 26:00.681
quarter-master loading transport

25:51.733 --> 26:00.681
team. And Lieutenant Colonel in charge, he was 
senior to me. This gives you an idea of General

26:05.385 --> 26:07.587
Collins. because I had laid out all the troop areas 
and so forth. Then I found out that these troops

26:12.406 --> 26:17.435
were coming to the beach with no means of feeding 
themselves. So I had to go back to that in their boat

26:17.455 --> 26:23.766
and shore regiment colonel and ask him for help in 
setting up the kitchen. We were feeding 1,000,

26:24.307 --> 26:27.533
1,500 people a week. And I took John Collins down 
there one day, a long, tall, lanky nigger with his

26:29.791 --> 26:38.359
hat on sideways, a big Adam's apple. He was a mess 
guard. And

26:40.081 --> 26:47.849
I said, what's that dump out there right back 
there? He said, sir, I can't get garbage,

26:47.869 --> 26:52.553
something to drain down there. I had them build it 
up this way. He showed us over it. He showed us his.

26:58.597 --> 27:00.601
where he kept his ration. You know, Filipinos are 
going to eat this. This is guarded 24 hours a day.

27:05.429 --> 27:13.183
General liked it, and so he died, because that guy 
knew what he was doing. But see, these two ports in

27:15.347 --> 27:21.098
Japan, nobody told me that one of them was closed 
because of mines. All of them were going to one

27:21.178 --> 27:23.001
place. So you thought you were shipping the troops 
to two different places, but actually you're only

27:24.247 --> 27:29.694
shipping them to one. And I couldn't depend on my 
plans on APA or AKS because, you know, the final

27:29.714 --> 27:40.207
authority is the captain of that ship. He may 
decide that his ship's not seaworthy and put a

27:40.227 --> 27:45.474
deck. Hi, Mama. I want you to meet Dr. Anderson. 
This is my wife, Jo. Nice to meet you. But he might

27:53.035 --> 27:59.704
decide that his ship's not seaworthy, and he had a 
great big hold I was going to put trucks in. He might

27:59.724 --> 28:06.312
weld a bulkhead right down the middle, and I could 
put jeeps

27:59.724 --> 28:06.312
in. So this quartermaster loading transport team 
would go aboard and check. And I was walking by one

28:12.460 --> 28:18.388
night, and a gentleman called and said, come here. 
I said, what?

28:21.790 --> 28:28.740
And he said, there's been a lot of misinformation 
about what was out here. He said, I want it stopped.

28:32.205 --> 28:37.332
He said, you want to tell that Lieutenant Colonel 
or you want me to? I said, I'll be glad to tell him.

28:39.355 --> 28:41.097
The only thing is, tell me who's running it. He 
said, by God, you are. He worked for a guy like that.

28:48.408 --> 28:50.110
When did you first get to Japan? When they sent you 
over there? On the last ship. September,

28:56.540 --> 29:00.325
I think. What were the conditions like? In Japan? 
Yeah. Well, defeated country. I was stationed in

29:08.196 --> 29:13.563
Osaka. Osaka.

29:17.127 --> 29:19.050
And firebombed almost left me. Not all of it, but a 
great portion of it, known as Pittsburgh. I'd like

29:25.551 --> 29:30.736
to go back to the Philippines for a minute. Part of 
my orders were that each soldier would be equipped

29:30.756 --> 29:43.950
with a farm-fitting bedroll. And I had the 6th 
Division sitting down here by a beach. by some

29:49.928 --> 29:57.797
loaded dogs, and I went up to the general, and I 
said, General, if we get them shipped out all set,

29:49.928 --> 29:57.797
the dog could sure would help us. He said, call a 
meeting up there with them. I said, yes, sir. On the

30:05.205 --> 30:08.609
way up, he said, you tell them what you want. I said, 
I'm a general. They'll look at me out of this thing

30:09.430 --> 30:13.494
and shake my head like that. So we made a ring, 
shipped them across the dock, and got rid of them.

30:18.211 --> 30:23.418
And then 10 days later, they transferred them out 
of our command to somebody else's command. But I

30:23.438 --> 30:26.783
had to furnish everybody one of those 
farm-fitting things. So I had borne 10,000 from

30:26.803 --> 30:30.989
this division, getting 5,000 from Manila. Nobody 
neglected to tell me that when they got to Japan,

30:32.511 --> 30:38.200
they were taken away from them. Because that 
clothes-fitting thing was causing upper

30:38.620 --> 30:43.006
respiratory infection. Nobody ever told me that. 
The other thing. All my female personnel, which

30:49.345 --> 30:58.818
were nurses and a few Red Crossers, the only way I 
could carry them to the beach was in the ambulance.

30:58.838 --> 31:00.841
So nobody could see. Rape was going on when the 
other right hand left. And I had a group of them. I

31:07.070 --> 31:10.174
was going to ship on an APA personnel. 
Quartermaster Lowry. Was it Filipinos then, or

31:13.459 --> 31:18.266
were rapes Americans, or Americans, or 
everybody? Blacks. blacks. In fact, in the south

31:23.124 --> 31:38.453
of the city, the only way you could take

31:23.124 --> 31:38.453
out a female personnel on a date was two couples and 
both of the males would be on it. They hung nine

31:38.473 --> 31:42.781
minutes of play. I'd rather not have that.

31:48.458 --> 32:06.921
They assault and

31:48.458 --> 32:06.921
rape

31:48.458 --> 32:06.921
the nurse and kill the male escort. And then did 
they have a court-martial? I wasn't in New Guinea

32:09.904 --> 32:11.286
at the time. Anyway, that's why the order came 
down. But then my quartermaster's little

32:13.990 --> 32:22.661
transport team came by, told me there was only one 
set of heads on that APA. Well, you can't have

32:24.303 --> 32:28.127
female personnel using the same set of heads. So I 
called 6th Army in Manila. I said, how about

32:35.236 --> 32:37.238
shipping them by air?

32:40.182 --> 32:42.765
And he said, well, I'll tell you what I'll do. 
belong to hospital nurses, which had come in from

32:43.302 --> 32:51.556
Marseille, France, incidentally. He said, I've 
got some extra nurses in Japan. He said, I'll

32:54.601 --> 32:59.469
transfer these out, and when they get there, I'll 
transfer some more in. I said, boy, you've got to

32:59.489 --> 33:01.753
deal. We weren't very close to that stuff. Those 
were the kind of problems. I had a telephone by my

33:10.152 --> 33:17.220
bed all night, and it rang a lot of times. But 
General Collins, he'd come over and he'd say, come

33:17.240 --> 33:25.589
on, let's go down and eat. He'd say, oh, General 
so-and-so, he's a Jew, but he sure slacks ham. He'd

33:30.594 --> 33:34.098
say, well, go down and eat with him. And boy, he was a 
fine guy to work with. And he got me out of trouble in

33:38.382 --> 33:41.505
Japan.

33:46.109 --> 33:46.309
I was out. I had an Aggie muster.

33:55.477 --> 33:55.998
And I had it in the hotel. A couple of Aggies got out 
in front of me. I had a flat on their Jeep. They were

34:01.022 --> 34:02.304
pretty drunk. They were cussing. Raising a pail 
coming right up. Pilling swifts on the road. So

34:08.386 --> 34:17.837
next morning my chief of section, Tommy Sawyer, 
said, don't worry, chief of staff won't see you

34:08.386 --> 34:17.837
until 8.30.

34:17.857 --> 34:19.099
And I said, what about it? He said, last night. He 
said, now just go in and keep your mouth shut. He

34:25.186 --> 34:32.875
said, if he restricts you to quarters for 30 days or 
something, I'll go to bat for you. I said, restrict

34:32.895 --> 34:34.457
me to quarters? I'm supposed to go home in two 
weeks. He said, you may not. So I went in to General

34:39.537 --> 34:45.566
Murray, and he said, your boys raised hell last 
night. Yes,

34:45.586 --> 34:49.612
sir. The general told me to do something about it. 
Yes, sir. He said, next time, take them out the back

34:53.097 --> 34:55.401
door. Yes, sir. I went back, Tommy saw you, and I 
said, everything's okay. He said, you can thank

35:02.371 --> 35:04.414
General Collins for that. He came up at breakfast. 
He told Murray to do something about it. The

35:13.922 --> 35:16.105
colleagues had him by the arm. What happened to 
Collins?

35:20.451 --> 35:28.282
He became a commanding general for Pacific 
Command. I

35:28.563 --> 35:37.315
don't know whether he's in the book or not. Have you 
ever seen the book? Mama, where's my book? I get

35:42.539 --> 35:58.230
this every year, a

35:42.539 --> 35:58.230
roster of retired Army general officers. And then 
in the front, they ice against it. Well, I don't

36:04.047 --> 36:05.668
know where it is. I think it's down here, too. 
They're kind enough to put in the list of the active

36:07.730 --> 36:13.536
officers by how they rank. It's always 
interesting

36:14.857 --> 36:20.862
to hear it, to me. General of the Army. Brad Lamb. 
Well, he's a general of the Army that retires. But

36:28.969 --> 36:32.873
see, they list them on their rank. And then this is a 
retired guy.

36:42.271 --> 36:44.055
Let's see what Collins is. He became a director of 
the American Red Cross at one time.

37:03.093 --> 37:24.795
Here

37:03.093 --> 37:24.795
he is, James F. He lives at 4133 North River Street, 
Arlington,

37:03.093 --> 37:24.795
Virginia. What I used to like when he was a 
brigadier, we'd be riding this old Aussie Army

37:24.815 --> 37:32.863
sedan with no rear shocks on it, bouncing along. 
pull out his paycheck. He said, sure it's going to

37:35.977 --> 37:43.931
be tough when he busts me back to a major after the 
war.

37:43.951 --> 37:49.801
Was there a lot of fear that people would lose a lot 
of grade as soon as the war was over? All the

37:51.104 --> 37:53.929
brigadiers went back. See, during World War II, 
Terry Every promotion was AUS, Army of the United

37:58.477 --> 38:03.785
States, which was temporary. Yeah, temporary 
promotion. Right. Now, the brigadiers went back.

38:10.656 --> 38:15.583
In fact, one that had been a brigadier became a 
commandant out of the A&M. He's a good friend of

38:15.603 --> 38:16.986
mine. He's a colonel. Most of them got back to the 
general officer.

38:38.909 --> 39:00.634
See, in this,

38:38.909 --> 39:00.634
in right here,

38:38.909 --> 39:00.634
in this book here,

38:38.909 --> 39:00.634
there are

38:38.909 --> 39:00.634
diamonds. And

39:00.655 --> 39:07.122
those plus there, which... What does that stand 
for? It stands for A-B-S. And here's F-D-N-E. Just

39:10.769 --> 39:20.538
to get

39:10.769 --> 39:20.538
an idea of how many generals they have in the Army. 
Yeah, and who they are. Get an idea of what their

39:24.242 --> 39:30.448
relative rank

39:24.242 --> 39:30.448
is. So it's interesting to look through it.

39:37.154 --> 39:40.337
I see people I've served with in various 
capacities.

39:47.050 --> 40:15.994
But anyway, in Japan, my primary job there, I got 
there, was

39:47.050 --> 40:15.994
the

39:47.050 --> 40:15.994
Corps

39:47.050 --> 40:15.994
had been modified so many times that it was 
Amendment Slank 21-6 to Amendment 10, where it got

40:17.645 --> 40:27.861
down to a poor company commander could never tell 
what was latest information. So that was one of my

40:29.143 --> 40:41.762
principal jobs was to completely revise it and 
bring it up to date, which I did and then carried up

40:29.143 --> 40:41.762
to Army for approval, and they said, well, just 
follows ours, and I said, that's what it's

40:42.316 --> 40:45.720
supposed to do. Our order's supposed to be based on 
ours. And, of course, it got wise on certain

40:49.564 --> 40:53.929
things. Some of the troops or divisions would call 
in and say they have seized the submarine dock.

41:00.295 --> 41:01.977
What'd I do with it? I'd call Army. They'd say, 
seize, hold, and guard pending further

41:04.840 --> 41:11.007
notifications. So I quit calling them. I just tell 
our group the same thing. And it took me two or two

41:17.095 --> 41:26.865
and a half months

41:17.095 --> 41:26.865
hard work. When did you leave your parents? 
Approximately December 1, 1946. 45.

41:40.822 --> 41:43.064
45, yes. Sorry

41:43.084 --> 41:49.691
about that. Did you have any relations with the 
Japanese people at all? Oh, not much. A little bit.

41:57.919 --> 41:59.380
How'd they behave? Hmm? How'd they behave? Oh, 
fine.

42:06.807 --> 42:09.850
Our quarters were in the new Osaka Hotel, which was 
a seven-story hotel modeled on one in Cleveland

42:10.842 --> 42:22.055
that was in Osaka. And we had it pretty deluxe. They 
had taken out steam heaters and wore them, but they

42:25.979 --> 42:29.183
put them back. And we had

42:30.684 --> 42:36.551
a house ball on every floor. People would come in 
and turn your bed down at night. And we had a, see,

42:42.196 --> 42:49.123
they

42:42.196 --> 42:49.123
broke people. See, a major is a field officer, but 
they broke it down in the Corps as colonel and above

42:49.143 --> 42:59.453
and other officers. So I ate with the peons down on 
the ring. Lobby had a printed menu. It was

43:03.878 --> 43:06.280
beautiful. Of course, it was GI food or GI-traded 
potatoes. It sure sounded good. Then they had a

43:11.913 --> 43:16.240
mezzanine dining room for you to take visitors. 
And on the fifth floor, we had a big, huge bar. It was

43:19.204 --> 43:22.910
luxurious quarters there. So you were treated 
really well? Yeah. The army just complicated it.

43:30.221 --> 43:32.805
Sure, right. Were you eager to get home in December 
of 45? Was I eager to get home? Did you ever consider

43:38.394 --> 43:39.996
staying in? At

43:41.005 --> 43:56.539
one time,

43:41.005 --> 43:56.539
they had a deal that you could go regular army as 
second lieutenant. Oh, really? This was after the

43:57.860 --> 43:58.781
war? No, it was during the war. You could go regular 
army as a second lieutenant? I mean, they would

44:03.305 --> 44:09.510
promote you up,

44:03.305 --> 44:09.510
you know.

44:12.713 --> 44:17.758
He might forget about you by the first lieutenant 
or something. He'll be starting all over again.

44:19.140 --> 44:21.002
And I was tired. I had worked hard and seen enough 
killing. I'll guarantee you I didn't want to go on

44:28.169 --> 44:35.077
an invasion of Japan lately. Tommy Sawyer told me, 
Come on, Japan, and stay another year. I said, I'll

44:43.431 --> 44:45.174
promote you to a lieutenant colonel. And I said, 
Colonel, if it delays me by so much as one day, I'm

44:46.776 --> 44:53.606
not interested. I was tired and nervous. I'd be 
fought.

44:59.414 --> 45:03.200
In those areas, your life's on the line all the 
time. I slept with a pistol in my pillow at night.

45:10.291 --> 45:16.619
I've been shot at and bombed at. Even as late as 50, I 
built a house out in North Oakwood.

45:22.446 --> 45:28.052
And I'd walk outside and say, gosh, what a 
beautiful night. And then suddenly the

45:28.072 --> 45:31.176
cockaneers see if I can hear a plane coming. And we 
had a little breakfast with a window in it.

45:37.561 --> 45:44.069
Absolutely would not have seen that in the night 
with the light on without the blinds on. Just, your

45:44.089 --> 45:45.731
neck crawls. One of those picks to take a pot shot at 
you. It's, uh, and my service was a whole lot less

45:50.336 --> 45:56.524
rough than a lot of others. So you were eager to get 
back to the civilian life, huh? I was eager to get

45:59.748 --> 46:01.630
back to the States. At that time I was tired and worn 
out and We had people been over there three years,

46:06.772 --> 46:18.489
and they were just walking ghosts.

46:18.509 --> 46:29.324
The conditions, the adamant that you took from 
malaria and all of that, boy, just, they're

46:18.509 --> 46:29.324
hard. Were you going to get back in the automobile 
business? Were those your plans? Yeah. Well, see,

46:34.432 --> 46:35.453
I had to be. Yeah. My dad ran during the war. Of 
course, couldn't get any cars. We just let him take

46:42.236 --> 46:43.577
it over. My partner worked for the quartermaster 
out at

46:43.657 --> 46:54.127
the base. We let my dad take it over, and just 
whatever he made on repairs and parking,

46:54.148 --> 47:01.235
he kept. He owned the building. He paid himself 
rent.

47:06.661 --> 47:07.583
But I was tired. I

47:08.406 --> 47:18.493
was tired of, you know, being in a position to 
think.
