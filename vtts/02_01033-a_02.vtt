WEBVTT

00:06.072 --> 00:07.353
And he decided he was going to get out. But what 
happened then was that Robert Kennedy said he was

00:07.373 --> 00:11.277
going to get in. And then those dumbass eastern 
liberals, they all said, well, this is just great.

00:21.088 --> 00:23.971
We're going to go with Bobby, and that's going to 
take care of this problem. And I said, bullshit,

00:24.612 --> 00:26.033
and came home. Because Jack Kennedy and Bobby 
Kennedy are just mainstream. I mean, they just got

00:32.768 --> 00:42.981
a different notion than the right wing of the 
Republicans about how to manipulate power to hold

00:32.768 --> 00:42.981
things together. But

00:43.061 --> 01:00.182
Jack Kennedy and others were involved in that war 
and in racism and all those things just as heavily

00:43.061 --> 01:00.182
as any right-wing redneck

00:43.061 --> 01:00.182
or financier. Okay. So we came close. At any rate, I 
never was going to ask people to vote for me. All I

01:08.860 --> 01:14.067
was going to do was get on TV and say, here's a spot we 
wanted to show y'all. That's why I'm running for

01:14.088 --> 01:16.190
governor. I'm not asking you to vote for me, but I 
wish you'd watch this spot. And then we were going

01:19.555 --> 01:21.918
to run those things. So that's as far as that went. A 
very interesting thing happened right after that

01:25.363 --> 01:27.886
when I came back. I'll just mention, I'm having fun 
on talking about this part of it. That was in the

01:36.168 --> 01:47.480
spring, and of course everybody's trying to 
figure out what we're going to do next that could

01:36.168 --> 01:47.480
have some effect and put some pressure on. And I 
traveled with the guy who was the SDS regional

01:47.500 --> 01:59.914
organizer at that time, and we went to a number of 
different campuses around the state.

02:01.818 --> 02:08.105
was the heaviest in political activity as far as 
New Left, anti-war, civil rights movement type

02:01.818 --> 02:08.105
stuff. But we went to a number of the other campuses 
and spent about two weeks on the road. And what I

02:12.149 --> 02:21.459
found out was that a whole lot of those campuses had 
people on them that really wanted to become active

02:12.149 --> 02:21.459
and just would like some help and some ideas about 
what to do. They wanted draft counseling

02:23.241 --> 02:24.803
information. They wanted anti-war information, 
civil rights, a whole ball of wax. And a whole lot of

02:31.973 --> 02:33.975
them were very isolated. And the campuses were 
very narrow and tight, prudish-minded as far as

02:33.995 --> 02:43.283
what the administration and the boards of regents 
or the governing boards would like to tolerate.

02:45.084 --> 02:55.433
And of course, a lot of them used to like to come to 
Austin because Austin was the most progressive

02:45.084 --> 02:55.433
and had the most open view about what life was about 
and how people ought to enjoy it. So what we decided

02:56.614 --> 03:00.698
to do was put together a traveling roadshow that 
summer. that would go around to a number of these

03:01.505 --> 03:04.909
areas. And we did. It was a multimedia show. It had a 
great name. It was called Mother's Grits, Austin

03:11.095 --> 03:19.704
Anarcho-Terrorist, New Left Beaten Evangelical 
Traveling Troop. It was a great bunch of people.

03:22.066 --> 03:29.554
Each place we went, there'd be between 15 and 30 or 
35 of them, just men and women. It's what I call a

03:30.631 --> 03:33.635
multimedia project. We used

03:33.655 --> 03:38.502
theater. We had music. We had draft counseling. We 
had open

03:43.510 --> 03:47.656
forum.

03:50.880 --> 03:55.487
We had some

03:50.880 --> 03:55.487
speeches. There was a man named Larry Caroline who 
was very... very active and a very articulate,

03:59.099 --> 04:05.345
forceful speaker who had a big impact during that 
time. He was a professor out here at the University

04:05.385 --> 04:22.682
of Texas in the philosophy department, and he's 
the one who made a number of very good

04:05.385 --> 04:22.682
revolutionary statements and got in major 
trouble with Frank Irwin and the jackasses who ran

04:05.385 --> 04:22.682
the university and most of the educational 
institutions in Texas. But Larry was a very well

04:26.234 --> 04:29.138
educated, very articulate, very popular. And he 
came to a number of those events. When we did five of

04:34.486 --> 04:36.529
them, we did one of them at A&M. And it was 
delicious. God almighty. See, the people that did

04:40.635 --> 04:45.262
that from Austin, they really believed in what 
they were doing. And they really worked hard at

04:45.282 --> 04:48.367
trying to communicate. So we knew when we went into 
these areas that there were going to be

04:49.449 --> 04:55.077
confrontation. The tension was there. We knew it 
was going to be there. What I did, I helped organize

05:00.509 --> 05:02.772
it. I did what they call the advance work. I'd go 
into a community a week or ten days, two weeks ahead

05:05.315 --> 05:10.941
of time to find the area where we could have it. Of 
course, none of them, the churches or the schools,

05:11.262 --> 05:16.007
there ain't no buildings available. So we found 
that out in a hurry. I am a lawyer, I was a lawyer, and

05:20.167 --> 05:26.659
one place they cannot stop you from having it is a 
public park. So we'd go into these places and we'd

05:26.679 --> 05:32.751
find a public park that would be suitable. Of 
course, we'd find some local people, usually

05:32.771 --> 05:41.247
there were two or three or four or five, sometimes 
more than that, who were willing to work with us and

05:32.771 --> 05:41.247
be identified with it. And then I'd work with the 
local media and I'd go to the sheriff and I'd tell

05:41.935 --> 05:46.841
him, you know, this is what's going to happen. You 
know, like it were the shit, but fuck you. We're

05:49.003 --> 05:49.985
going to do it anyway. And and I didn't come on that 
abrasive to start with, but I didn't take any shit

05:50.045 --> 05:59.336
off any of the guy that I remember the sheriff over 
in Commerce, Texas. We went to we went to Commerce,

05:59.356 --> 06:02.860
East Texas State. We went to Denton, North Texas 
State. We went to A&M at Bryan College Station. We

06:08.286 --> 06:11.250
went to San Marcos and we went to Dallas. And, of 
course, Commerce was the most redneck ignorant

06:12.226 --> 06:19.737
goddamn bunch of office holders that I ran across. 
The second day I was there, I went to see the sheriff

06:20.478 --> 06:23.362
and told him what we were going to do. We were going 
to be down in that park a week from tonight, and we

06:23.382 --> 06:30.071
were going to have our own portable generator 
there, and we were going to have microphones. And I

06:30.131 --> 06:31.673
laid it out. We were all very honest and 
straightforward. And I said, you mean a lot to me.

06:36.931 --> 06:39.736
probably don't like our politics and what we 
believe in, but so be it. We're going to talk to the

06:39.756 --> 06:41.359
people in this area. We know that a lot of them do 
agree with us, and more of them would like

06:41.379 --> 06:45.947
information, and we're going to do it. And I forget 
the exact sequence, but at one point he said, he

06:47.129 --> 06:58.950
said, you come over here and do that, and he said, 
I'm going to throw you so far back in jail, they'll

06:47.129 --> 06:58.950
have to pipe your civil rights to you. And I said... 
You go right ahead, you son of a bitch. I've got a law

07:02.774 --> 07:09.062
firm in Dallas and one in Houston, the ACLU, that's 
ready to put Commerce, Texas on the map. And you

07:09.082 --> 07:17.494
better go talk to your bosses and the 
commissioner's court and the county judge and see

07:09.082 --> 07:17.494
if that's what they want to happen to Commerce, 
Texas. If they do, well, we'll get it on. So, and

07:20.458 --> 07:22.721
they backed off. I mean, that was interesting. But 
when we went to A&M,

07:32.433 --> 07:33.394
There were some people there. There was an 
economics professor and his wife. Since they

07:37.719 --> 07:44.826
moved to Austin, several years, a number of years 
ago, moved to Austin. At any rate,

07:44.846 --> 07:53.616
we set up out there in that field, dedicated 
parkland. I mean, they couldn't stop us. And we had

07:55.698 --> 07:58.821
a big crowd, I don't know, 600 to 1,000 people. And 
there was a lot of hostility. And

08:03.820 --> 08:12.269
in our theater troupe, about two-thirds women and 
a third men. And the women were very talented.

08:18.175 --> 08:23.061
And more than that, they were very adept at 
disarming hostility. And so they helped break the

08:24.762 --> 08:32.371
ice and ease the tension as far as at least getting 
the show off the ground. And we kind of went through

08:32.391 --> 08:33.692
the through the general routine. And what we found 
was that we had one of our best occasions there at

08:37.866 --> 08:51.144
A&M because the Aggies, they had never, ever been 
allowed to speak on a microphone. And what we would

08:51.164 --> 08:59.394
do, you know, Caroline, our main speaker, would 
give our statement about the war and what ought to

08:51.164 --> 08:59.394
be done and how individuals ought to relate to 
that. And then we'd have an open forum and anybody

09:00.015 --> 09:03.780
that wanted to talk could come up and talk with the 
general understanding that you say whatever you

09:04.385 --> 09:12.299
want to, cuss, do whatever you're going to do, but 
you've got to do it within two or three minutes. And

09:14.102 --> 09:16.587
god damn, they lined up. It's been an hour and a 
half, I know, with people who never had a chance on

09:16.887 --> 09:26.224
campus to express themselves. about the war in 
Vietnam and about civil rights and all the big

09:26.761 --> 09:34.829
issues of the day and all the big conflicts that 
were going on. And it worked out fine because what

09:35.770 --> 09:46.060
you generally find out, if people will be honest, 
is that you've got a lot more agreement than you've

09:35.770 --> 09:46.060
got disagreement if you get past certain hurdles. 
Nearly everybody will agree they don't like

09:46.080 --> 09:54.068
poverty and they don't like hunger and they don't 
like people to die from bad health practices. And

09:55.263 --> 09:59.507
then at least you got the possibility then to talk 
about what you're going to do about it. Is this

09:59.927 --> 10:03.030
system here going to do anything about it or do you 
have to do something else? But the A&M trip worked

10:03.050 --> 10:05.112
out well. And that Mother's Grits Roadshow went 
five different places that summer and addressed

10:07.374 --> 10:21.566
audiences a total of probably a couple of thousand 
at the most. One of our larger crowds was at A&M in

10:21.646 --> 10:24.088
Commerce. Had a pretty big crowd at Dallas and Lee 
Park, I think it was.

10:32.535 --> 10:47.852
But

10:32.535 --> 10:47.852
a lot of the most active people off of those 
campuses then either formed local groups and

10:32.535 --> 10:47.852
began to do things or a lot of them moved to, they 
dropped out of school. They moved to Austin, they

10:47.892 --> 10:50.395
moved to San Francisco, they moved to Madison. 
They got active, they started doing things. which

10:54.224 --> 10:55.805
is what it was all about. Do you want to get back to 
more of this? I'm digressing so much, I don't know

10:58.408 --> 11:01.230
how much we're covering. You been having a good 
time? Who's winning today? What organizations

11:06.074 --> 11:11.399
were active in Austin in the 60s, and then what 
organizations were you active in? Yeah, okay. The

11:14.241 --> 11:18.885
first thing we should remember is a lot of 
organizations overlap. They're used for

11:18.925 --> 11:20.287
different purposes. You find a lot of the same 
people in several different organizations. And

11:25.257 --> 11:35.612
you use, not in any manipulative way, because we 
were honest with the media, but you use whatever

11:25.257 --> 11:35.612
seems to be the proper structure at the time. There 
was the SDS, Students for Democratic Society, at

11:36.594 --> 11:44.946
the University of Texas, and it was also an 
off-campus group.

11:48.892 --> 11:54.100
Within SDS, there was a group called the Friends of 
Progressive Labor. Popple, F-O-P-L, which is a

11:55.126 --> 12:06.258
Maoist-oriented, pseudo-Maoist, I think, 
because I admire Mao, and I think he would disown

11:55.126 --> 12:06.258
this bunch. I mean, they really had their head up 
their ass. But they were a Maoist group that had a

12:08.040 --> 12:17.830
national party, which was a disciplined 
Marxist-Leninist party. Are you familiar

12:18.270 --> 12:18.971
with... They have a... They believe in secrecy and 
they're a whole bunch of... They're contrary to

12:24.868 --> 12:28.173
what I think of as the New Left and what I was a part 
of. The Trotskyists, what do they call it? The

12:32.621 --> 12:36.026
Socialist Workers Party of America. There's 
three or four socialist parties in the United

12:36.307 --> 12:41.275
States and I never have gotten them all straight. A 
lot of different splinter groups. The Communist

12:44.500 --> 12:48.707
Party, I think they had two or three members here in 
Austin. Not anything like the media, but I think

12:49.312 --> 12:53.616
there were two or three that were party members. 
And as I say, they were very tame. They didn't even

12:56.820 --> 12:58.161
come close. We had one group who were anarchists, 
what I call anarchists. A lot of artists and

13:04.367 --> 13:10.393
musicians and dancers and highly talented people 
that were influenced by the people in New York

13:04.367 --> 13:10.393
City. And they were called up against the wall, 
motherfucker. That was a saying in New York City,

13:14.237 --> 13:19.082
and it spawned groups all across the the country 
called up against the wall motherfuckers. And

13:21.657 --> 13:26.403
they did a lot of guerrilla theater, did a lot of 
confrontational work. And they were your local

13:27.184 --> 13:29.688
man. To me, they were an organization. According 
to some academic theories, they would never be

13:31.871 --> 13:37.819
called an organization, because they wasn't no 
leader. They wasn't nothing except they got

13:37.839 --> 13:44.108
together when they felt like it and did something.

13:47.817 --> 14:07.520
The American Friends Service Committee, that's 
the Quaker group, has always been heavily

13:47.817 --> 14:07.520
involved in progressive anti-war, civil rights 
movement, prisoners, Amnesty International,

13:47.817 --> 14:07.520
which is very prominent still today. Those are 
some of the groups. The Farm Workers Union was here

14:11.524 --> 14:17.571
in Austin, and that was a group who made the initial 
efforts in the Rio Grande Valley to organize farm

14:18.344 --> 14:21.767
workers.

14:24.510 --> 14:42.726
Originally, they were associated with Chavez, 
the guy from California, but there were conflicts

14:24.510 --> 14:42.726
with that California Chavez group about whether 
or not the Texas people could strike, and the

14:24.510 --> 14:42.726
California people didn't want them to because 
they wanted to focus on where they felt they could

14:24.510 --> 14:42.726
do best. I won't get into all those arguments, but 
the Texas people wanted to strike, did. That

14:46.189 --> 14:47.170
caused a split. and the farm workers, so there was 
the Texas Farm Workers Union, but they were part of

14:47.892 --> 14:54.562
the local group. The black groups here in Austin, 
there's an Urban League, which, and the NAACP,

14:55.624 --> 15:12.489
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, 
SCLC, and at one time there was some SNCC, the

14:55.624 --> 15:12.489
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Now 
the Urban League is a very establishment

15:13.110 --> 15:15.013
organization, Uncle Tom, property, conscious, 
oriented bunch of upper affluent, a few, there's

15:15.972 --> 15:26.287
not many black folks. The NAACP in Austin, it's not 
true nationally, because nationally it's

15:27.969 --> 15:36.802
strictly a middle of the road to the right 
organization, very conservative. Always

15:36.822 --> 15:39.846
believes in going to court and seeing if you can't 
do something at the ballot box. I mean, they're not

15:39.866 --> 15:41.288
major... They were not major forces in the Civil 
Rights Movement. They didn't believe in

15:44.938 --> 15:49.684
confrontation, and they didn't push things. 
Martin Luther King's outfit, Southern Christian

15:49.704 --> 15:58.196
Leadership Conference, and SNCC, and CORE, we had 
a CORE group, Congress of Racial Equality. They

15:59.477 --> 16:00.238
pushed things. And most people don't realize that 
the main impetus in the Black Civil Rights

16:00.559 --> 16:10.752
Movement, just like in the movement...

16:12.217 --> 16:15.341
in the United States overall at that time was the 
young people. So it was SNCC who pushed things.

16:18.905 --> 16:22.409
Martin Luther King was the most articulate 
speaker, but H.R.F. Brown, Stokely Carmichael, a

16:22.429 --> 16:32.200
number of those folks, along with a lot of the young 
people, really pushed things in the black

16:22.429 --> 16:32.200
movement. In fact, no doubt in my mind, they are the 
ones who, within the black community, put the

16:32.220 --> 16:40.350
pressure on Martin Luther King, finally made him 
take a stand on the Vietnam War. For a long period of

16:43.441 --> 16:45.424
time, he would not do it. He would not come down 
against it, figuring he wanted to concentrate on

16:45.444 --> 16:50.713
civil rights. But the black young people said, no, 
bullshit. They're killing us. They're dragging

16:55.061 --> 16:56.423
us off to war. And you say we're not going to say 
anything about it. You're not going to be a leader

16:59.689 --> 17:02.774
much longer, old man, if you don't start saying the 
right thing. And they're the ones who did the

17:04.096 --> 17:06.861
preliminary work for a lot of the King 
demonstrations. Most people don't understand

17:08.773 --> 17:10.474
that, too. It's just like the way the labor union 
movement was organized in the United States. Most

17:14.538 --> 17:22.165
of that work was done in the 20s and 30s by the 
radicals, the wobblies, the communists. It was

17:22.185 --> 17:26.129
not done by AFL-CIO types. I mean, it was done by 
people who had major intense convictions about

17:26.149 --> 17:33.856
what was right and what was wrong and were willing 
to get hurt and die for it. And a lot of them did. At

17:37.081 --> 17:39.808
any rate, to go down those groups. Now, what else 
did we have? What were you active in? Well, the only

17:43.337 --> 17:51.377
one that I continuously identified with was SDS.

17:53.568 --> 17:55.511
And SDS went through a progression. If you've 
studied much history, you don't know it. It

17:57.835 --> 18:01.681
finally became sectarian and began to close up. 
What I always liked about it, it was very open, very

18:01.941 --> 18:04.365
honest. Spent whatever amount of time was 
necessary in meetings or otherwise to let

18:05.026 --> 18:11.636
everybody speak their view and to hash things out. 
It did not go on strict parliamentary procedure.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.724
We vote and cut off debate and that kind of shit. 
That didn't happen. You might spend five hours but

18:19.387 --> 18:26.674
when you finished, you were either going to have a 
consensus or you weren't going to do anything,

18:19.387 --> 18:26.674
which is a way for humans to approach problems. At 
any rate, SDS was later, because of sexism and

18:26.975 --> 18:46.795
because of the way men treated women and because of 
sectarianism, some of those rigid groups

18:26.975 --> 18:46.795
gained too much control in national SDS. I never 
did identify that much with National SDS.

18:52.906 --> 18:58.873
I don't think most of the people in Texas or 
Berkeley or Madison, the major areas, did either.

18:59.013 --> 19:03.038
I mean, SDS was a lot of anarchist tendencies 
there. I mean, control close to where you live and

19:03.078 --> 19:06.942
what you want to do and what you're willing to do. 
Don't write a paper off 500 miles from here and tell

19:07.002 --> 19:16.613
me I'm supposed to go do this when you don't know 
what I'm doing. So SDS, of course, earlier, back

19:16.829 --> 19:24.502
when I was a liberal, still believed that 
electoral politics might offer. I was a member of

19:24.542 --> 19:29.050
the Texas Democratic Coalition. I quit. The last 
time I voted was when Lyndon became president. I

19:32.396 --> 19:32.997
quit voting. I knew that was too much shit. It 
wouldn't do any good. Would you have classified

19:39.087 --> 19:42.870
yourself as a liberal in the early 60s or later as a 
radical? No. In 1960, I first worked for the man who

19:43.791 --> 19:55.202
ran for governor, and then I worked for the guy who 
was the United States senator, and then I was with

19:43.791 --> 19:55.202
that state liberal organization. So I was a 
Democrat, liberal Democrat in 1960 until right

19:55.222 --> 20:03.849
after Jack Kennedy got killed. And of course, I was 
learning all the time, particularly from the

20:03.869 --> 20:07.913
black people, that the system wasn't working and 
wasn't going to work as far as the basic stuff that

20:08.348 --> 20:17.180
bothered me, racism and poverty and later on the 
war. It just wasn't going to change unless you made

20:17.360 --> 20:20.404
change.

20:23.187 --> 20:32.019
So in 1964, when Lennon cut off the money and that 
organization fell apart, I became heavily

20:23.187 --> 20:32.019
involved in the Civil Rights Movement. And during 
that time, I was fortunate. I got to meet Martin

20:34.803 --> 20:36.545
Luther King. They paid my way to come over to at 
their national convention at the Southern

20:38.453 --> 20:44.683
Leadership Conference to give a speech about how 
we did the block worker program in Texas. And I got

20:44.944 --> 20:50.753
to meet him and a bunch of the people who were 
national figures. Of course, that was a

20:50.774 --> 20:57.825
top-heavy, preacher-oriented, middle-class 
organization as far as the people that were

20:50.774 --> 20:57.825
well-known. The ones who did the dangerous, 
heavy-duty work were younger, and you wouldn't

20:57.925 --> 21:04.917
know their names.

21:08.440 --> 21:14.606
And so I guess during that, and then I guess about a 
two-year period there, I would have considered

21:08.440 --> 21:14.606
myself a radical. I was a liberal Democrat, and 
then I was a radical. And then as I became more

21:17.109 --> 21:28.720
aware, and it was around the SDS New Left people, a 
lot of them were very well-read and educated, and

21:17.109 --> 21:28.720
not with degrees. And I don't mean that, but I mean, 
they'd done a lot of intensive work. I learned a lot

21:32.544 --> 21:33.525
more. And out of all those discussions, I became 
what I think of, what I still am today, which is

21:37.145 --> 21:40.629
revolutionary. I believe it takes basic change. 
And unfortunately, I believe in our society,

21:44.955 --> 21:53.866
American United States society, that that's not 
going to be accomplished by electoral change.

21:56.830 --> 22:03.038
Big interests are not going to permit you to take 
away all their property because you vote. And that

22:03.058 --> 22:06.983
bullshit, anybody that's naive and thinks that, 
they'll shoot you first. So from about 1967, 68 on,

22:08.482 --> 22:18.056
I considered myself a revolutionary. And that's 
by my own definition. I don't belong to any, never

22:20.199 --> 22:28.491
have belonged to any organized, structured, 
disciplined group. In fact, it's contrary to my

22:28.851 --> 22:31.395
politics. I'm kind of an anarchist. libertarian 
revolutionary, that's the way I describe myself.

22:42.333 --> 22:46.839
So would you like to define the term radical or the 
term revolutionary? Do I like the term? What term

22:47.780 --> 22:49.622
would you like to define or both? Oh.

22:53.967 --> 22:57.391
Because you don't really count yourself as a 
radical. Well, I think a revolutionary is a

22:58.092 --> 23:03.919
radical, but a radical is not necessarily a 
revolutionary. Are you familiar with Saul

23:05.182 --> 23:06.885
Alinsky? He's a man who organized a bunch of 
projects that have continued to exist, starting

23:08.347 --> 23:18.403
up in Chicago and Rochester, New York. And there's 
a bunch of them outgrowth here Texas, you familiar

23:22.141 --> 23:23.763
with Acorn? Now that's an Alinsky type 
organization, Saul Alinsky. A lot of the people

23:28.667 --> 23:35.353
that run that outfit got their training and their 
principles from this Saul Alinsky. Now they're

23:35.834 --> 23:36.615
radicals. They don't

23:37.515 --> 23:51.068
think necessarily that a revolution, a major 
confrontation is necessary to attain what they

23:37.515 --> 23:51.068
want to attain. They go in more for holding 
meetings and deciding what needs to be done in a

23:52.297 --> 24:02.393
small, defined area such as a neighborhood or a 
city. We need this kind of electricity. We need

24:06.059 --> 24:06.980
this kind of roadway. They don't work as much on 
what I think of as interrelationships. If you

24:11.427 --> 24:16.836
really understand power, you know you're not 
going to get as limited on what they're going to

24:11.427 --> 24:16.836
give you. but they believe that it's worthwhile 
and those things can be obtained, and that's what

24:17.373 --> 24:23.701
they want to do. I personally think Solomonsky is 
highly manipulative. I think that he knows that

24:26.685 --> 24:43.266
the frustrations that occur in people after you 
spend three or four or five years of doing that type

24:26.685 --> 24:43.266
of organizing and work, and all you do is get bits 
and pieces and they throw you a bone occasionally,

24:26.685 --> 24:43.266
but you never see the major changes. What happens 
is people become more radical. They either do that

24:45.959 --> 24:47.802
or drop out. Well, I think what he is is an old 
leftist. I think he's probably 50 years ago some

24:53.693 --> 25:00.585
secretary and maybe had been a Communist Party 
member. I don't know if he was or not, but they're

25:00.685 --> 25:04.311
highly manipulative people. I don't know if 
you're familiar with them or not, but don't ever

25:04.331 --> 25:10.903
trust anybody who's a party member of them. of the 
sectarian mass group. They tell you what they

25:15.690 --> 25:18.074
think they need to tell you. They're like liberal 
democratic politicians. They do what's

25:21.160 --> 25:26.209
necessary to get you to do what they want you to do.

26:08.512 --> 26:15.501
They

26:08.512 --> 26:15.501
did a lot of anti-war work, and they had a group 
called Fuck the Army, FTA. And they'd go around to

26:16.803 --> 26:22.530
different spots to help get information out. Of 
course, Jane found a major drawing card, Tom

26:22.550 --> 26:27.116
Hayden, to a lesser extent. He was one of the 
national founders and writers of the Port Huron

26:27.236 --> 26:37.810
Statement, which is the early basic document of 
SDS. which is a pretty good liberal democratic

26:38.735 --> 26:44.861
type analysis of society at that time. At any rate, 
we had them come here to Austin. And up here at Fort

26:49.045 --> 26:57.153
Hood, which is a major military installation, 
they trained army troops and others. We had a

26:57.573 --> 27:07.122
coffee house, military organizing coffee house, 
called the Oleo Strut, which is named after a part

26:57.573 --> 27:07.122
of a helicopter. train helicopter units out 
there. And we had Fonda and Hayden work out there

27:10.787 --> 27:27.830
and go out there and, of course, attracted large, 
lots of people, lots of GIs who were anti-war, who

27:10.787 --> 27:27.830
most of them stoned out. I mean, God, the dilemma 
those men were in was a lot of them, they're going

27:27.850 --> 27:37.362
through training, they know where they're going, 
and they don't like it. They're afraid they're

27:37.696 --> 27:38.898
going to get killed. They're afraid they're going 
to do something they don't want to do. You know,

27:41.121 --> 27:42.162
what the hell am I going to do? At any rate, they both 
spoke out there. We had them here in Austin. We

27:48.371 --> 27:55.061
finally found a place to... We had one on-campus 
event. No, we didn't. We couldn't find an

27:57.665 --> 28:00.028
on-campus site. We finally used the back room of 
Schultz's Beer Garden, which is a very famous

28:00.408 --> 28:06.437
Austin tavern. And they made that back room 
available to us. I helped organize it. I went and

28:13.050 --> 28:13.911
talked to the owner. And the owner was a guy named 
Larry Bales, who was in the Texas House of

28:13.931 --> 28:17.476
Representatives at that time. A lot of guts. I 
guess he was the most so-called liberal Democrat

28:18.918 --> 28:25.346
in the Texas House of Representatives in that 
year. The Texas legislature, I think, passed a

28:26.227 --> 28:31.935
resolution in both houses, something like 500 to 
1. that Jane Fonda was an asshole and a communist

28:32.506 --> 28:38.114
and bad news and don't come and all that. But Larry 
went ahead and let us use the place. We had a

28:42.080 --> 28:45.886
standing room on the pack crowd. And then we also 
went on campus. But we never could use a major

28:52.315 --> 28:54.218
facility. I don't know whether this happened at 
A&M. I imagine it. I'm damn sure it has happened,

28:58.831 --> 29:18.591
but here at the University of Texas, they've 
really tightened up since the 60s and early 70s

28:58.831 --> 29:18.591
about campus regulations, what they will permit 
and will not permit, according to their legal

28:58.831 --> 29:18.591
theory, most of which is unconstitutional, but 
then you've got to go through the bullshit of

28:58.831 --> 29:18.591
taking it to court. It takes a long time to bring 
those court fights. About where you can meet,

29:22.114 --> 29:24.957
where you can talk, Supposedly you have free 
speech and free assembly, but you don't.

29:33.645 --> 29:41.813
And since the 60s and early 70s, they put in major 
changes in the regulations to try to tighten that

29:33.645 --> 29:41.813
up. The walls you see out here at the university 
campus around the stone walls around, those were

29:43.635 --> 29:52.303
put up because of the demonstrations. It makes it 
much easier from their point of view for crowd

29:55.565 --> 30:09.501
control to have a three- or four- or five-foot wall 
that somebody has to come over before they can have

29:55.565 --> 30:09.501
one coffin handle a much larger area than if it's 
all flat. So a lot of our landscaping was done for

30:10.322 --> 30:21.834
crowd control purposes, to try to shut off the 
university, which is, of course, contrary to the

30:10.322 --> 30:21.834
basic notion of what a university is about. It 
ought to be an integral part of the community not

30:25.062 --> 30:26.744
walls around it. Okay, I don't want to digress any 
longer, but there was a very effective GI

30:28.325 --> 30:42.300
organizing effort going on here and at Fort Hood, 
and then the Fort Hood people would come to Austin

30:28.325 --> 30:42.300
and join in with what we were doing, and we'd go help 
them. And we had law firms here in Austin, one big

30:42.941 --> 30:54.073
law firm called a movement law firm that would do 
all that heavy-duty political work because the

30:42.941 --> 30:54.073
people really believed in it, the lawyers did. and 
do it on a free basis, on a mandatory free basis,

30:54.678 --> 31:06.731
because we'd all get involved in trying to raise 
the money and get the evidence together and do all

30:54.678 --> 31:06.731
the shit work and leg work that it required to do 
whatever it was legally we were trying to do. And a

31:08.934 --> 31:21.327
lot of the CO, conscientiously subjected cases, a 
lot of the military cases where they were trying to

31:08.934 --> 31:21.327
kick people out of the military without due 
process and without certain benefits. A lot of the

31:24.328 --> 31:28.814
lawyers here helped out on it. Okay, what have we 
got? What's next? Okay. What were the major

31:30.596 --> 31:34.181
incidents, quote unquote, in Austin? Just a few 
major ones. Yeah, just a few because I made a

31:35.623 --> 31:45.897
collage one time when I was drinking a lot and had 
about a week and I had a board about the size of this

31:35.623 --> 31:45.897
window and And I made up cards and used clippings 
and pictures and a bunch of shit that I had. I had 60

31:50.447 --> 31:56.837
or 70 different items on that board of things I was 
involved in. Maybe a third or a fourth of them are

31:57.958 --> 32:01.464
what you would probably call major. The big one as 
far as

32:03.547 --> 32:13.082
longer term conflict with the university was the 
Chuck Wagner case. And I was heavily involved in

32:14.446 --> 32:19.633
that one.

32:22.797 --> 32:26.582
We effectively won that over a period of time. I 
mean, nobody once read it. And we did exert

32:29.185 --> 32:33.430
considerable pressure on the university. And we 
were effective in using the case itself as an

32:33.711 --> 32:43.423
organizing device to reach more people about the 
issues that were involved. A lot of good lawyers

32:45.395 --> 32:55.385
around the state

32:45.395 --> 32:55.385
helped out, volunteered to work on that case. And 
it had the district attorneys and the district

32:56.086 --> 33:03.193
judges who were sitting in their britches, 
because they were very heavy duty lawyers. And we

33:04.214 --> 33:10.000
were on the side of the angels as far as the 
constitutional legalities go. There were some

33:10.040 --> 33:14.625
factual problems, but not major ones. Mario 
Maverick, Jr., out of San Antonio, which is a very

33:15.095 --> 33:19.219
prominent name, was involved. Warren Burnett, 
who's probably the best trial lawyer and one of the

33:19.279 --> 33:26.066
best in the United States out of Odessa, was 
involved. Cameron Cunningham, Jim Simons, and

33:26.086 --> 33:29.369
Brady Coleman from here in Austin. Sam Houston 
Clinton, who's now one of the judges on the Texas

33:29.590 --> 33:36.076
Court of Criminal Appeals, the top criminal 
court. He was one of the defense lawyers, one of our

33:36.096 --> 33:39.079
lawyers. Dave Richards out of Dallas. the biggest 
labor law firm in Dallas. Bob Hall out of Houston,

33:44.868 --> 33:48.672
the biggest labor law firm in Houston. And of 
course, that means they're among the biggest in

33:50.134 --> 33:55.439
the country, because those are the laborers, and 
they're very good lawyers.

33:59.324 --> 34:06.111
The Chuckwagon case, of course, that involved 
whether the university could really crack down on

34:07.053 --> 34:30.748
shutting off that the university facilities to 
what they think of as outsiders people who will not

34:07.053 --> 34:30.748
enroll dues paying students and of course now some 
people might buy that definition but we didn't and

34:07.053 --> 34:30.748
i don't a university is an open institution as far 
as i'm concerned particularly when society's

34:07.053 --> 34:30.748
money pays for it don't tell me that I've got to pay 
tuition to be able to go talk to a student or a

34:31.285 --> 34:37.472
teacher over there or read a book. Fuck you. At any 
rate, that was a major one. We did another major

34:43.119 --> 34:45.701
event. It wasn't a demonstration. Is that what you 
want, demonstrations? We held a legal conference

34:49.306 --> 34:54.472
at Wembley, which this is all well documented in 
the Texas Observer.

34:57.455 --> 35:01.039
And I helped organize that, where we had a bunch of 
trial lawyers and plaintiff's lawyers and

35:01.559 --> 35:13.572
liberal lawyers from around the state who came and 
spent several days at a guest ranch that we rented

35:01.559 --> 35:13.572
up at Wimberley. We brought in speakers. Bill 
Cussler, you know William Cussler, who's

35:16.495 --> 35:23.002
defended the Chicago 7. He's one of the lawyers who 
defended the Chicago 7. Charles Gary, who

35:27.867 --> 35:34.436
defended Angela Davis, the Black Panther woman, 
he was there from San Francisco. We had a number of

35:36.319 --> 35:47.435
outside speakers, and then we had a lot of 
workshops and discussions between movement

35:36.319 --> 35:47.435
activists and lawyers about what was going on and 
what was needed. Traditionally, the legal

35:48.196 --> 35:53.063
profession does not want to give up control of a 
legal case. In other words, if a lawyer's hired to

35:55.492 --> 36:01.701
pursue a certain case, he wants all the control 
about what's going to be said and done and not done

35:55.492 --> 36:01.701
in the courtroom. Well, that is basically 
contrary to movement politics. Movement

36:07.168 --> 36:12.075
politics says, me, I'm the defendant, or me, I'm 
the one who they're after. I've got to say so, and

36:12.135 --> 36:17.103
you're the lawyer, and I want you to do what I tell 
you to do. Don't tell me I can't talk, or don't tell

36:17.163 --> 36:22.971
me I have to dress this way or that, but help me. But 
don't try to say you're going to make the final

36:24.938 --> 36:49.748
decision because you're not i mean if you're not 
going to help me then i'll get somebody else and

36:24.938 --> 36:49.748
that was a problem that we were trying to overcome 
we were having problems getting enough lawyers

36:24.938 --> 36:49.748
that would do the legal work on a reasonable basis 
but we had a good legal conference i think it had a

36:24.938 --> 36:49.748
big impact and it is documented in the observer 
other big events of course For a street

36:50.673 --> 36:53.517
demonstration, I guess it was the early 70s. I 
can't ever remember dates. All I remember is kind

36:54.879 --> 36:56.601
of the flow of events. You know, Nixon got in, Nixon 
got re-elected, and they're always lying to you. I

37:02.128 --> 37:15.246
mean, they're going to negotiate, and they're 
going to get out, and this is a step, and then you

37:02.128 --> 37:15.246
find out they've invaded Cambodia, and they're 
bombing this, and they're doing all this shit they

37:02.128 --> 37:15.246
don't want to tell you about. And we had a major 
demonstration night with 20, 25,000 people in the

37:15.682 --> 37:24.654
streets of Austin, which is, that's lots of people 
for the size of this city at that time.

37:28.239 --> 37:32.345
The number of demonstrations out at the 
university would have 10 to 15,000 people there.

37:34.007 --> 37:38.653
That makes the establishment figures very 
nervous. Whenever that many people who are upset,

37:39.795 --> 37:45.182
some of whom are very angry, some of whom are 
unstable. And a lot of them very intense and

37:46.276 --> 37:48.980
committed. Most of them are not unstable. I don't 
know if you ever get that notion, but that's not

37:52.224 --> 37:54.727
true. But some are, and you'll get crazy things 
happen. You have demonstrations where, at that

37:59.534 --> 38:15.355
point in time, I don't know, they may have changed 
the law on this now, where it's not illegal for me to

37:59.534 --> 38:15.355
carry a torch and put rags on the end of a stick, put 
gasoline, light it, and walk down the street at

37:59.534 --> 38:15.355
night. Well, you think about it, if you're the 
chancellor of the university and you're going to

38:16.651 --> 38:28.789
have 500 people out there and you're going to have a 
torchlight parade around your house in the middle

38:16.651 --> 38:28.789
of the night, that makes you nervous. You might get 
your house burned down. And if you concentrate on

38:31.754 --> 38:35.880
the economic institutions, all of this was 
happening around the country. I mean, the

38:35.900 --> 38:38.204
intensity level was going up. The property was 
starting to get destroyed. The pressure was going

38:40.547 --> 38:43.011
on. Bombs were going off. Buildings were being 
burned up. capitalism had to make some

38:47.296 --> 38:49.638
adjustments. Plus the military wasn't wanting to 
fight. I'm not talking about the fucking

38:51.720 --> 38:54.543
officers, fuck them. They just do what they're 
told generally, but the men didn't want to fight.

39:01.709 --> 39:04.032
So they knew they had to, they lost their war. They 
had to get out. What else did we have? Major event in

39:09.156 --> 39:15.362
Austin, the first and probably the second farm 
workers march. coming

39:16.557 --> 39:34.242
from the valley, I forget how long it took, but 
probably a month or six weeks where the group of

39:16.557 --> 39:34.242
farm workers started marching up here, and it 
culminated in a big march down Congress Avenue. It

39:34.262 --> 39:39.630
started out of St. Edwards, which is about five, 
six, seven miles out in South Austin, and it came up

39:34.262 --> 39:39.630
to the state capitol. And there must have been 
15,000 or 20,000 people, and that was about a

39:39.650 --> 39:43.035
minimum wage. Farm workers were not covered by it. 
by minimum wage, and they were getting screwed

39:45.802 --> 39:49.766
bad, still are for that matter. That was a major 
event. We had at one point an event I thought worked

39:52.188 --> 40:03.299
well because one of the tensions always was 
whether you focus on a single issue or whether you

39:52.188 --> 40:03.299
take on several issues. And of course, if you're 
revolutionary or radical, you understand the

40:03.319 --> 40:07.924
connections between events. There is a 
connection between poverty, the war, and racism.

40:12.308 --> 40:13.429
There's certain interests that look at those 
things in a certain way and want them, you know,

40:13.865 --> 40:20.893
things to happen a certain way. So we did it at one 
point, most of the time whenever a big anti-war

40:20.913 --> 40:30.864
thing would come along, it'd be pretty much a 
single focus. And a lot of years of the anti-war

40:31.444 --> 40:36.750
thing, of course this is when all across the 
country the same process is going on. More and more

40:37.251 --> 40:41.115
people are seeing the relationship between these 
different issues. Then they would also mention

40:44.273 --> 40:49.758
racism and poverty and Chicano sexism. All of this 
would come up and what kind of banners are you going

40:49.778 --> 40:52.701
to have? What kind of signs are you going to have? 
Who are the speakers going to be? How long are you

40:55.424 --> 40:56.645
going to let them speak? Who's going to speak 
first? Who's going to speak last? If you know the

40:59.408 --> 41:02.651
dynamics of meetings, you know there are certain 
benefits. There are certain benefits to be first,

41:02.931 --> 41:05.854
last, or in the middle. And we finally had a... A 
demonstration here, I don't know how many, 3, 4,

41:14.345 --> 41:24.438
5,000 people, called We the People, where it was 
multifaceted. I mean, it hit about 8 or 10 issues. A

41:27.322 --> 41:40.639
lot of the local neighborhood groups who never had 
any organized way of participating got into that

41:27.322 --> 41:40.639
because it was a mass public protest about we don't 
like the way things are. and we the people are going

41:40.872 --> 41:45.877
to say something about it, and I don't know whether 
you're going to do anything about it, but we're

41:40.872 --> 41:45.877
going to say we don't like it. And that worked out 
pretty well, and it helped get us away from the

41:45.897 --> 41:50.642
single focus. The Trotskyists always wanted to 
just talk about the war. Don't talk about this,

41:54.907 --> 41:58.150
don't talk about that, just talk about the war. 
And, of course, most of the new left people and the

41:58.991 --> 42:04.757
American friends didn't want to do that. They 
wanted to talk about more than just the war. What

42:08.681 --> 42:09.141
else? We had... major civil rights.

42:18.389 --> 42:19.910
They weren't major in terms of number. They were 
major in terms of they were what was going on in

42:19.990 --> 42:32.022
Texas that had an impact when we had 
demonstrations at the local theaters to force

42:19.990 --> 42:32.022
them to let black people get in. We had the same way 
with bars, public accommodations, where we had

42:39.513 --> 42:48.524
major demonstrations with some physical 
conflicts because some of the university area

42:39.513 --> 42:48.524
places did not want blacks to come in. We had a man 
who sat down in the governor's office to see the

42:49.425 --> 42:52.789
governor. The governor wouldn't see him and he 
stayed. Had a major confrontation with the

42:56.052 --> 43:00.177
governor. And out of Austin, a good friend of mine, 
man I worked with, in fact I lived with him and his

43:00.197 --> 43:06.685
wife and kids for a year. B.T. Bonner, who was a 
black man organizer with the Southern Christian

43:07.813 --> 43:21.532
Leadership Conference, Martin Luther King's 
outfit, helped organize some major civil rights

43:07.813 --> 43:21.532
demonstrations in Huntsville, Texas, which a 
number of us from Austin went over to support. And

43:22.253 --> 43:27.381
those were very intense and very dangerous, but 
very effective.

43:33.790 --> 43:36.233
That's some of them. This is going to... In your 
opinion, is the art of practicing law immoral?

43:42.444 --> 43:42.864
Why? And why not be a people's lawyer like Ralph 
Nader or work for the ACLU? The first part of it was

43:49.293 --> 43:51.336
what? Is the art of practicing law immoral? And 
what was the next phrase? Oh, and why? No, I don't

43:58.445 --> 43:59.487
think it's immoral. Of course, I have some 
problems with the whole notion of morality. I

44:06.016 --> 44:07.097
mean... We're not careful. We get off into 
religious philosophies and all that. I don't

44:11.904 --> 44:13.206
believe in that shit either. I believe we have to 
decide what's right and wrong and basically good

44:13.226 --> 44:18.533
for people. So in that sense, I consider myself a 
very moral person. I think that practicing law,

44:21.097 --> 44:23.781
you can be a moral person. I don't think that 
lawyers who have good convictions and good

44:24.962 --> 44:31.732
principles find it very difficult. If you look at 
what the body of the laws are, In our society,

44:37.300 --> 44:45.028
they're to protect property rights and business 
relationships primarily. The people who go to

44:45.589 --> 44:51.676
prison, contrary to what most people think, are 
not murderers and rapists. I don't know what the

44:51.696 --> 44:52.617
figures are. Seventy-five to ninety percent of 
them are crimes against property. Somebody that

44:57.882 --> 45:04.269
stole something or tried to steal something or a 
burglar or that kind of thing. And I don't believe

45:05.771 --> 45:06.852
that. I don't believe that's a crime. Now, a crime 
to me is that Rockefeller, that son of a bitch is a

45:09.086 --> 45:14.955
fucking criminal. He's got more money than he 
could possibly use, and he doesn't do people any

45:14.975 --> 45:21.565
good. People starve to death, and he's sitting on 
top of a whole lot of money. Fuck him. And that's a

45:25.751 --> 45:26.432
crime. Lawyers have to deal with that all the time. 
I mean, they're defending...

45:33.022 --> 45:33.683
They have to... appear before judges and play a 
certain game, or they get thrown into jail

45:34.355 --> 45:40.304
themselves or get thrown out of court. You tell a 
judge, I think you're a liar, I know how you got to be

45:40.784 --> 46:00.733
a judge, I don't think you can possibly give a fair 
decision in this or any other case, which is, if you

45:40.784 --> 46:00.733
know how judges are selected, as I do, it's true in 
nine times of the cases, they gave money or they did

45:40.784 --> 46:00.733
this favor or that favor, and that's how they got to 
be judges.

46:03.953 --> 46:06.477
So lawyers have to deal with that all the time. You 
have to deal with district attorneys who are

46:06.877 --> 46:18.734
mostly sleazy, young, ambitious people who've 
been fed a bunch of goodies about how they can make a

46:06.877 --> 46:18.734
name for themselves prosecuting these heinous 
criminals. They're never smart enough to realize

46:18.915 --> 46:27.387
that Rockefeller's a criminal, not the fellow 
who's trying to steal for his family.

46:32.654 --> 46:33.876
And in my own case, you know i thought there were 
more important things for me to be doing i went back

46:34.075 --> 46:58.092
and doing the chuck wagon case we had a number of 
lawyers who were doing the courtroom work and the

46:34.075 --> 46:58.092
formal legal stuff but i was effectively working 
as a lawyer i was gathering evidence i was doing the

46:34.075 --> 46:58.092
legwork the footwork getting all the pictures and 
statements and talking to the tv people and all But

46:59.557 --> 47:04.944
I thought there were more important things for me 
to do, generally speaking, than to practice law.

47:07.908 --> 47:21.586
I have a number of friends practicing law that I 
think are doing a pretty good job of helping to

47:07.908 --> 47:21.586
change things for the better and helping people 
who can't afford it.

47:21.646 --> 47:27.454
ACLU, my niece, by the way, is the woman, the person 
who started. She was the Texas Civil Liberties

47:29.445 --> 47:31.341
Union. She was the first.
