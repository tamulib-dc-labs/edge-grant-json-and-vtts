WEBVTT

00:03.575 --> 00:05.779
Make sure it's fully plugged in. Okay, this is Ron 
Shorn on Wednesday, June 2, 1993, at the

00:07.902 --> 00:20.503
University of Texas at Austin Astronomy 
Department, and I'm talking with Larry Trafton.

00:20.523 --> 00:23.748
So, for the record, Larry, would you give your full 
name? Lawrence Monroe Trafton. Okay. Okay. And

00:27.115 --> 00:28.656
where were you born and when? Boston, 
Massachusetts, 1938, July 31st. How did you first

00:35.683 --> 00:41.788
get interested in astronomy? I can remember being 
interested in astronomy in the second grade,

00:41.808 --> 00:56.802
walking out on a cold winter's night somewhere in 
Massachusetts from an Eaton's drugstore and

00:41.808 --> 00:56.802
recognizing the constellation Orion in the 
winter sky. which I just read about in a book

00:57.187 --> 01:04.195
written for children on the constellations.

01:04.235 --> 01:12.063
So that reaffirmed my faith in the reality of the 
written material on constellations.

01:13.525 --> 01:14.886
Where did you go to undergraduate school? 
Caltech. What was your major? Astronomy. And what

01:18.690 --> 01:21.833
year did you graduate? 1960. Why did you decide to 
pick astronomy as a major rather than? Oh, I knew by

01:27.926 --> 01:32.551
the time I was a teenager I wanted to be an 
astronomer. I was an amateur, and I'd ground and

01:32.751 --> 01:36.816
polished my own six-inch mirror, built my own 
telescope. I was building and assembling

01:36.856 --> 01:40.039
telescopes in the sixth grade and seventh grade. 
So astronomy was one of my early interests. In

01:44.304 --> 01:52.253
freshman year, I briefly considered geology and 
some other majors, just because I knew I'd be

01:44.304 --> 01:52.253
making this lifetime decision. I said, nah, I'll 
stick with astronomy. Why did you go to Caltech?

01:56.858 --> 02:03.226
Because they were the, I figured it was the best 
school available in the world for an education in

01:56.858 --> 02:03.226
astronomy. They ran, of course, Mount Wilson, 
Mount Palomar, and had an excellent reputation.

02:10.095 --> 02:11.196
Okay, where did you go to grad school? Also 
Caltech, for the same reasons. Okay. Who was your

02:15.762 --> 02:17.063
thesis advisor? Guido Munch. Did you pick him, or 
did he pick you, or was it mutual? I went around the

02:23.814 --> 02:30.183
department talking to the various professors 
about a topic for my thesis. That previous summer I

02:31.124 --> 02:44.683
worked at JPL doing a literature review on 
Jupiter, and Guido mentioned a topic in planetary

02:31.124 --> 02:44.683
atmospheres, solar system. And that picked my 
interest. I was also very interested in the space

02:48.010 --> 02:50.293
program at the time. And so I decided to pursue a 
thesis in solar system rather than in some other

02:51.133 --> 02:58.340
general field in astronomy.

03:01.383 --> 03:04.045
OK. What did your thesis consist of? It consisted, 
well, its title was pretty descriptive, Study of

03:04.866 --> 03:11.032
Energy Balance in the Atmospheres of the Major 
Planets. And its nucleus was applying the

03:11.672 --> 03:14.535
pressure-induced opacity of hydrogen and helium 
in the structure of the atmospheres of the major

03:15.258 --> 03:22.368
planets. In other words, it, for the first time, 
used this opacity as a thermal opacity for

03:22.428 --> 03:30.419
determining the pressure-temperature 
structure. Now,

03:30.439 --> 03:39.932
after you got your PhD, you got a job, and you must 
have been thinking about it before you were quite

03:30.439 --> 03:39.932
finished. or was your first job after you got out of 
grad school? At Kirtland Air Force Base in

03:44.225 --> 04:05.631
Albuquerque, New Mexico, fulfilling an ROTC 
commitment, Air Force ROTC, I was in charge of an

03:44.225 --> 04:05.631
Earth-orbiting satellite with 12 or 13 
experiments on board to measure the hazard that

03:44.225 --> 04:05.631
solar flare particle radiation would pose to a 
military astronaut, a so-called MAL, manned

03:44.225 --> 04:05.631
orbiting vehicle astronaut. That program was 
canceled by McNamara, I think in the late 60s, but

04:08.397 --> 04:18.468
at the time the military had an interest in Ph.D. 
level astronomers, particularly those

04:08.397 --> 04:18.468
specializing in the solar system for that 
purpose. Okay, and then where did you go after

04:19.609 --> 04:20.931
that? University of Texas at Austin. How come 
here? Well, this was actually one of three

04:26.217 --> 04:29.581
choices. Another choice was with Kuiper's group 
in Arizona. And the third choice may have been at

04:35.532 --> 04:39.275
Flagstaff, as I recall. At Lowell? At Lowell, or 
with Bob Weldy. At USGS? At USGS. And I figured that

04:47.782 --> 04:55.669
I would need a place with a good computer, good 
access to telescopes, a good research library.

04:55.709 --> 05:00.893
And

04:55.709 --> 05:00.893
I was communicating with Harlan Smith at the time. 
And UT came across as being the most having the most

05:05.502 --> 05:07.664
potential for a career in research. My goal was to 
do research rather than to teach. How did you get in

05:11.988 --> 05:14.590
touch with Harlan in the first place? Oh. I mean, 
did you just meet somewhere, or did you write him a

05:17.333 --> 05:19.715
letter? The first time I ever met Harlan Smith

05:19.735 --> 05:33.788
was when I was having a restaurant on Route 3 in 
Massachusetts, eating at a restaurant somewhere

05:19.735 --> 05:33.788
between Boston and Cape Cod on Route 3. And out of 
the blue, Guido Munch and Harlan Smith, I guess

05:34.949 --> 05:44.759
they were returning from a meeting in Woods Hole or 
something, recognized me and came over and sat

05:34.949 --> 05:44.759
down. Guido introduced me to Harlan Smith, who at 
the time, I think, was secretary of the AAS. And as I

05:52.907 --> 06:01.395
recall, he invited me to come see, I can't remember 
what, if ever I was in town. That's my first

06:02.877 --> 06:04.339
recollection. When was that? That was about 1962. 
Okay, when you were still a grad student. That's

06:07.924 --> 06:09.366
right, when I was still a grad student. When did you 
get your PhD? In 65. 65, okay. Was working that

06:15.414 --> 06:25.868
summer at JPL the first time you got associated 
with NASA money, or had you done some other stuff

06:15.414 --> 06:25.868
before that? Of course, Caltech runs JPL, and I was 
working there for the summer as a Caltech student I

06:34.012 --> 06:36.396
think it was two summers that I worked there. I 
think

06:36.736 --> 06:43.226
it was right after my senior year. I think it was two 
consecutive years in graduate school. Not after I

06:47.312 --> 06:51.919
graduated, but after my first graduate years is 
when I worked there. And one of those years, I

06:52.520 --> 06:56.346
worked for Hiram Spinrad. I think it was the second 
year. And the first year, I did a review on Jupiter

06:58.549 --> 07:02.415
for Ray Newbern. What have you been doing since 
you've been to Texas, if you can summarize the

07:04.117 --> 07:12.188
general kind of work? Basically observational 
and some theoretical research in astronomy,

07:12.668 --> 07:30.192
almost entirely solar system astronomy, 
specializing in the outer planets and their

07:12.668 --> 07:30.192
atmospheres and those with satellites having 
atmospheres, particularly high-resolution

07:12.668 --> 07:30.192
spectroscopy. in more recent years, branching 
out into the infrared and ultraviolet astronomy.

07:36.799 --> 07:42.965
Since 1977, I'm involved with the Hubble Space 
Telescope on the instrument definition team for

07:36.799 --> 07:42.965
the high-resolution spectrograph. And just 
recently, data has been coming down from the

07:44.547 --> 07:47.630
Hubble. I'm involved not only as a guaranteed time 
observer for my service on the team, but also as a

07:47.670 --> 08:00.043
so-called general observer, competing with 
other astronomers for time on the Hubble. It's

08:00.361 --> 08:01.262
branched out.

08:06.028 --> 08:11.255
What would you say was the... Well, let's start 
this way. Do you feel planetary astronomy is part

08:12.697 --> 08:14.960
of astronomy? Very definitely. And you consider 
yourself an astronomer? Yes, even an

08:19.446 --> 08:20.827
astrophysicist. Do you think real quote-unquote 
astronomers look down on planetary astronomers?

08:27.436 --> 08:28.377
If they're on... Another world looking towards 
the Earth, yes. There are those that would say that

08:33.597 --> 08:42.489
planetary astronomy is looked on as a pariah by 
stellar and extragalactic. Well, there have been

08:42.509 --> 08:49.438
periods in the history of astronomy where people 
have thought that solar system astronomy has been

08:42.509 --> 08:49.438
mined out. One of those was after the 1930s, for 
example, when it was discovered that life didn't

08:49.478 --> 08:56.828
exist on Mars. conditions were not hospitable to 
life on some of the other planets. And so

09:01.247 --> 09:07.895
astronomers at that time would naturally turn 
their attention to more distant objects. Comets

09:09.958 --> 09:15.445
were included as distant objects, even though now 
we consider them as part of solar system

09:09.958 --> 09:15.445
astronomy. So comets were always considered in 
good favor by the mainstream astronomical

09:15.665 --> 09:23.676
community. Of course, for the advent of NASA, 
there's been a renaissance in planetary and solar

09:25.141 --> 09:34.793
system astronomy, which is very 
multidisciplinary. I mean, it involves not just

09:35.473 --> 09:42.362
astronomers, but geologists, exobiologists, 
astrochemists. And so I think there's a lot of

09:42.382 --> 09:51.052
respect for solar system astronomy because it is 
so multidisciplinary and is known, therefore,

09:42.382 --> 09:51.052
well-known among a number of fields. But as for 
your traditional astronomer, I think they do

09:56.140 --> 10:01.346
consider planetary astronomy to be somewhat 
different from what they do. What was planetary

10:03.828 --> 10:09.214
astronomy like back in the 60s when you got into it? 
Back in the 60s, it was high-resolution

10:09.234 --> 10:24.190
spectroscopy with photographic plates, 
ammoniated plates to increase sensitivity in the

10:09.234 --> 10:24.190
near-infrared, namely beyond about 7,800 
angstroms, 7,000 angstroms. pre-flash plates to

10:24.608 --> 10:32.080
increase sensitivity in the visual region, or 
baking plates in ovens to do the same thing. There

10:32.621 --> 10:36.848
were also photomultipliers, the famous 
RCA-31-whatever.

10:38.390 --> 10:39.872
Oh, photomultiplier. 1P21. 1P21, that's it, 
yeah. The 31-something was a later

10:42.617 --> 10:45.021
photomultiplier, too. Single-channel devices 
for scanning one wavelength at a time or for

10:45.962 --> 10:52.152
obtaining the magnitudes through various 
filters. Astronomy in those days was very much a

10:55.951 --> 10:59.836
one-man thing. One man went out and he did the 
entire project himself at the telescope over a

10:59.936 --> 11:05.924
period of nights. He reduced the data and he 
published the data. The equipment was less

11:09.709 --> 11:12.974
expensive, less complicated. There were hardly 
any computers either running or reducing the data

11:13.034 --> 11:17.079
in those days. There was a lot of independency 
among astronomers. Astronomers are very

11:22.564 --> 11:24.827
independent people. The person next door could be 
doing research which is totally unrelated to

11:25.127 --> 11:28.851
yours. No consortia, such as with the Hubble's 
nowadays. Very independent, very personal.

11:35.658 --> 11:43.287
Funding was relatively easy to get, and it didn't 
take a whole lot of funding to do a research

11:35.658 --> 11:43.287
project. There was still a lot to be discovered, 
particularly in planetary astronomy, which had

11:43.747 --> 11:50.134
been neglected for so many years. And with the 
advent of new telescopes like the one at McDonald,

11:50.300 --> 12:03.062
the 2.7 meter, there was now guaranteed time to 
spend a certain amount of telescope time on

11:50.300 --> 12:03.062
astronomical observations. I think that may have 
been, by the way, another factor in my coming to

12:03.483 --> 12:11.056
Texas, the fact that I know I could get time on a big 
telescope to do astronomical observations. Up to

12:11.818 --> 12:14.923
that time, the number of big telescopes were 
limited. And I remember doing some observations

12:15.950 --> 12:20.674
from the 100-inch and 60-inch at Mount Wilson. But 
you had to compete with the regular astronomers

12:20.755 --> 12:25.659
for time to do astronomy in those days. Would you 
say that NASA's bucks were critical to

12:26.920 --> 12:33.707
reinvigorating planetary astronomy? Played an 
enormous role. I mean, a number of telescopes were

12:34.768 --> 12:44.657
built, the McDonnell Telescope, the IRTF, and 
corresponding instrumentation designed

12:34.768 --> 12:44.657
towards doing astronomy of extended sources, the 
type of high-resolution spectroscopy, the kind

12:46.038 --> 12:55.111
of astronomy that is useful for planetary work. 
And also, about that time, the computer became

12:56.914 --> 13:01.420
noticed. And I think the space program and NASA, 
and NASA dollars in particular, have certainly

13:02.602 --> 13:15.420
applied the spinoff from computers in the area of 
astronomy in particular, ground-based

13:02.602 --> 13:15.420
planetary astronomy. And then, of course, 
there's been the advent of space-based planetary

13:16.362 --> 13:23.730
astronomy, which is the IUE with its fantastic 
record. I think IUE is still going after how many

13:23.750 --> 13:25.792
years? I mean, that's not just planetary 
astronomy, but that's where the first looks,

13:26.453 --> 13:34.922
that's where the Joving Aurora was discovered and 
some other areas in planetary astronomy.

13:38.586 --> 13:40.247
Where do you think planetary astronomy is? What 
shape is it in now, and which way is it going? Well,

13:45.522 --> 13:47.785
planetary astronomy has really come a long way. 
Spacecraft have visited all the planets except

13:48.265 --> 14:00.579
Pluto, and there is planning for even a vast Pluto 
flyby mission in the works. There's the Hubble

14:00.759 --> 14:08.929
Space Telescope, which has finally been 
launched, and looking not only at planets, but the

14:00.759 --> 14:08.929
rest of astronomical objects. IUE is still going. 
What there has been a great deceleration on is the

14:12.488 --> 14:22.800
plans for future space missions, future missions 
to do astronomy. The concept that's small,

14:23.421 --> 14:35.675
better, cheaper, faster is now dominating the 
huge flagship-type missions such as Galileo and

14:23.421 --> 14:35.675
Ulysses. There's an enormous funding crunch 
that's being felt at all levels in the government.

14:41.362 --> 14:42.023
It's being felt in planetary or solar system 
astronomy. There's been some competition with

14:47.204 --> 14:57.158
the things like the space station, but I think 
things like the space station are inevitable.

14:57.238 --> 14:58.560
That's part of human destiny. I think most of the 
friction between astronomers today, between

14:59.382 --> 15:07.834
those varying the space station and unmanned 
facilities, are based mainly on funding. They

15:07.854 --> 15:12.060
assume that if the space station is canceled, for 
example, there will be that much more money for

15:12.682 --> 15:14.404
ground-based unmanned astronomy. I don't think 
that necessarily follows. Funding is a big

15:17.987 --> 15:23.392
problem, and it may get worse before it gets 
better. But I still think there is a lot to do in

15:25.113 --> 15:30.618
solar system science from the ground and from the 
space. What do you consider the most worthwhile

15:31.179 --> 15:35.483
thing you did in planetary astronomy? The most 
worthwhile thing? Yeah, you might have to carve

15:38.465 --> 15:40.527
something on your tombstone, would you? Oh, my 
gosh. I guess one candidate is my thesis work,

15:45.014 --> 15:56.234
recognizing the thermal, being able to calculate 
the thermal structure of the planets. A lot of

15:56.254 --> 16:08.777
little things, little discoveries here and there 
concerning composition, various things such as

15:56.254 --> 16:08.777
Neo's atmosphere or Titan, work in Pluto. It's 
hard to put my finger on any one thing, but a whole

16:10.529 --> 16:14.836
collection of little things. Just gradual 
progress here and there from infrared, visible,

16:15.677 --> 16:20.906
and ultra-valid astronomy. Progress along a 
broad front at one step at a time in many different

16:22.248 --> 16:25.633
areas. A lot of irons in the fire. In the past, there 
was some concern that if planetary people got

16:28.338 --> 16:37.212
their own sub-society, they would get cut off from 
normal astronomy. Well, they did get the DPS, the

16:42.167 --> 16:48.956
Division for Planetary Sciences, and their own 
captive journal, Icarus. In your opinion, have

16:50.858 --> 16:56.345
these been good things or bad things? Well, at the 
time all this was happening, there was an

16:56.365 --> 17:01.371
explosion in journals throughout science. I 
mean, I think the number of journals increased by

17:01.391 --> 17:04.515
more than an order of magnitude. the time Icarus 
came online and the time it was adopted as being the

17:04.799 --> 17:09.784
official journal of the society. So even within 
the remainder of astronomy, there are the advent

17:09.844 --> 17:16.391
of new journals. So I don't think that solar system 
astronomy stands out as being different from

17:17.432 --> 17:24.559
everybody else in this respect. I think this was 
going on everywhere. And therefore, it doesn't

17:26.481 --> 17:30.165
taint planetary astronomy in any way. Do 
planetary astronomers talk to other types of

17:31.343 --> 17:40.297
astronomers about the same as they did when you 
started out, more or less? I would say at first

17:41.458 --> 17:57.182
less, but now it's starting to be more and more 
because things have developed so much in both

17:41.458 --> 17:57.182
areas, in regular astronomy and planetary 
astronomy, that people are starting to examine

17:41.458 --> 17:57.182
the interface. Do other stars have planets? What 
about Oort clouds around other stars? Can they be

18:03.293 --> 18:05.897
studied from the vicinity of the Earth? People, 
with the advent of advanced instrumentation,

18:07.399 --> 18:19.638
advanced infrared instrumentation and 
detectors, people have been able to study

18:07.399 --> 18:19.638
observationally regions of star formation. And 
some of the problems in planetary astronomy, the

18:20.900 --> 18:27.029
big problem in planetary astronomy is what is the 
origin of the solar system? How did it evolve? How

18:28.904 --> 18:32.168
did the atmospheres and so forth evolve? And you 
can ask the same questions about what's going on in

18:32.188 --> 18:35.493
star formation. How are these stars being formed? 
Are planets necessarily being formed around them

18:37.715 --> 18:41.300
or not? So I see a collision course between the 
scientific objectives of solar system astronomy

18:41.981 --> 18:55.198
and astronomy in general, particularly that 
involved with the interstellar medium and star

18:41.981 --> 18:55.198
formation and infrared astronomy. I think that 
ultimately there will be a merging of interests of

18:55.567 --> 19:00.052
people. You may find people doing research in both 
areas.

19:07.121 --> 19:12.307
What's the current status of planetary astronomy 
here at the University of Texas? Is it a little

19:12.327 --> 19:14.770
separate kingdom? Is it growing, shrinking, just 
staying out of the way, doing great things, or

19:14.950 --> 19:21.077
what? It's a close-knit group. The planetary 
group here is really close knit, but I would

19:24.878 --> 19:29.923
characterize it as being largely isolated from 
the rest of the department. I mean, people go and

19:29.943 --> 19:35.048
sit in each other's seminars and listen to what's 
going on. We have a solar system seminar. Now and

19:37.751 --> 19:43.877
then we will get some people from the other 
departments, but not very often. There is also an

19:44.618 --> 19:50.764
intermediate group which deals with dynamics of 
solar system bodies. They come to our group. We

19:52.606 --> 19:53.367
know what each other is doing in the fields, but I 
would say that there's probably a minor boundary

19:53.870 --> 20:05.523
between that and those who... Who would you 
consider the planetary group here in Austin?

20:05.543 --> 20:18.837
Well, Bill Cochran, Anita Cochran, Ed Barker is 
still doing research in planetary astronomy,

20:05.543 --> 20:18.837
myself,

20:05.543 --> 20:18.837
graduate Whipple next door. Fred Whipple. No, no, 
Art Whipple. Judith Gorgi, a graduate student who

20:23.502 --> 20:31.754
just got her Ph.D. Paul Hemingway. Jeffries does 
some dynamical work. There is a sub-dynamical

20:36.321 --> 20:40.347
group, but I would broadly include them in solar 
system. Pete Shalas.

20:45.254 --> 20:46.375
Perhaps Fred Benedict. What about Smolichowski? 
And Smolichowski, of course, very definitely. So

20:52.730 --> 20:59.097
you're no danger of extinction here or anything 
like that? No, not in the near term, anyway.

21:08.027 --> 21:10.870
What kind of NASA funding have you had over the 
years? I don't need all the details. Well, out of

21:14.454 --> 21:17.397
Brunk's program has been our main source. Were you 
funded out of that block grant for a number of

21:17.417 --> 21:20.661
years? Bronx Block grant out of the Planetary 
Astronomy Program. That grant had been in place a

21:24.235 --> 21:27.819
couple of years when I came here in 1969. And it was 
converted to individual grants, I think, in 1991.

21:35.085 --> 21:41.672
In 1991, it ended, and each one of us had to submit 
individual grants. I think that was a step

21:42.232 --> 21:46.256
backwards, because now we all have to do our own 
administration. We all have to write, parallel

21:46.316 --> 21:50.580
our own annual reports. and keep track of the 
accounting. We can't use the economies of scale.

21:54.766 --> 21:59.133
Those of us who are especially good at accounting 
do the accounting for the entire block. Those of us

21:59.174 --> 22:03.742
who are good at writing reports do the report 
writing for the entire block. Everything has to be

22:03.762 --> 22:07.749
done in parallel by everyone involved. And I think 
NASA is getting less for its money as a result of

22:08.149 --> 22:12.978
this reduction. It lost an economy of scale. I was 
going to ask, do you have any gripes? And there's

22:19.381 --> 22:20.422
one right there. There's one right there. Do you 
think that people at headquarters really

22:21.263 --> 22:27.070
understand what you're doing? I've had the 
feeling in the past, talking with Brunk and with

22:29.674 --> 22:37.144
Juergen Rahe, that they actually do keep up. They 
actually do have an idea of what I'm doing. Also, in

22:40.187 --> 22:44.513
Juergen's particular case, he is also an editor on 
volumes, like this Time Variable Phenomena in the

22:44.982 --> 22:52.071
Jovian System, where I publish some of my results. 
So he gets to see some of the stuff I do, not only from

22:52.091 --> 22:55.816
the reports I submit. And he's very interested in 
getting these reports, so I assume he reads them.

23:00.341 --> 23:04.546
But he also gets them from the literature that he's 
involved with himself. I also had the feeling that

23:05.848 --> 23:09.513
Brunk kept up with what I was doing. I noticed, 
perhaps, maybe slowed down in the period that he

23:11.932 --> 23:16.878
was involved very heavily with the development of 
the IRTF. He seemed to get a little more remote from

23:17.218 --> 23:21.683
what we and perhaps others were doing around that 
period. But I understand he was heavily involved

23:22.884 --> 23:28.571
with the IRTF at the time it was being built.

23:29.932 --> 23:31.694
Well, here's two questions about the public. Do 
you think planetary astronomers have done a good

23:31.794 --> 23:35.138
job selling themselves to the public? I think that 
many of them are doing a good job in selling

23:37.058 --> 23:40.801
themselves to the public. We have something at 
McDonald Observatory called Public Night, once a

23:41.142 --> 23:50.770
week when the public can come in and hear a program 
which includes a talk by the astronomer of the

23:41.142 --> 23:50.770
night. And when I've been that astronomer, I've 
given a 15-minute talk on what I've been doing in

23:51.431 --> 24:01.921
solar system astronomy, and then I spend another 
10 to 15 minutes answering questions. And those

24:02.001 --> 24:06.745
questions, judging from the kind and tone of those 
questions, people are very interested. in what's

24:07.332 --> 24:08.273
going on. They genuinely are curious to know 
what's going on in planetary astronomy. Back when

24:13.842 --> 24:26.461
I was an undergraduate in the late 50s, I was a guide 
at the Griffith Observatory and also experienced

24:13.842 --> 24:26.461
the same genuine interest by the public in what 
goes on in the stars and the fields. A really deep

24:28.484 --> 24:30.707
curiosity I have a lot of faith in the public's 
interest in astronomy and solar system astronomy

24:31.025 --> 24:37.255
in particular, just based on my own personal 
experiences. I've also attended star parties,

24:37.836 --> 24:50.156
dropped in on star parties at McDonnell 
Observatories and seen the long lines in front of

24:37.836 --> 24:50.156
even the little telescopes way out there in the 
middle of nowhere in West Texas.

24:51.738 --> 24:56.526
There are people in the planetary astronomy field 
who are seeking and in some cases getting money. by

24:57.805 --> 25:12.368
studying hot current topics like ozone, for lack 
thereof, search for extraterrestrial

24:57.805 --> 25:12.368
intelligence, planets around other stars, and 
killer asteroids. Do you think that's a good idea,

25:12.809 --> 25:16.855
or do you think it'll backfire? Do you think some 
are good and some aren't? I see no harm in a certain

25:19.239 --> 25:25.028
amount of that, but I would not like to see that 
become a large part of the focus of planetary

25:25.666 --> 25:28.109
astronomy. I would not like to see NASA develop too 
much towards looking back towards Earth. One of

25:35.600 --> 25:38.363
their programs is called Mission to Planet Earth. 
I think that would be a mistake to make that too big a

25:38.744 --> 25:48.477
part of their program, because I think that would 
lose a lot of the romance that the exploration of

25:38.744 --> 25:48.477
space has among your average public. I think that 
people do want to go out into space to know what's

25:54.472 --> 25:57.376
out there and eventually to send people out there. 
And I think if you make the program too practical,

25:57.416 --> 26:08.170
too much like other programs that exist in the 
nation, then that will actually hurt NASA. And by

26:08.831 --> 26:15.280
parallel argument, I think it may even hurt 
astronomy or planetary astronomy. If we make our

26:16.181 --> 26:24.192
programs too much like they were prepared for the 
front page of a newspaper rather than for

26:24.627 --> 26:25.589
scholarly journal. There are some people that 
feel that NASA never has given enough money for

26:27.672 --> 26:40.172
analysis of the data once they got the pretty 
pictures in. Have you found that to be true? That's

26:42.336 --> 26:48.846
been a bone of contention in some quarters since 
NASA started. At the very early days of the space

26:49.197 --> 26:59.032
program, I definitely had the feeling that the 
glory lay in the launches, not with what happened

26:49.197 --> 26:59.032
after the launch, not with the data that was 
collected. I saw this when I was in the Air Force.

27:01.696 --> 27:11.410
The Air Force was launching its own satellites, 
and there was a lot of glory and attention in

27:01.696 --> 27:11.410
everything that led up to the launch, and a sudden 
decline in interest in what happened afterwards.

27:12.392 --> 27:17.820
I think NASA has been somewhat sensitive to this 
argument and has generally tried to apply funds to

27:18.155 --> 27:24.864
the extension of duration of missions and for the 
reduction of data afterwards. But I think in many

27:25.504 --> 27:27.287
cases that wasn't enough. I think that it's a lot 
cheaper, for example, to keep funding a

27:27.948 --> 27:39.362
spacecraft going around Venus while it's working 
and getting additional data than it is to build

27:27.948 --> 27:39.362
another spacecraft and send it there. I mean, if 
it's working, it's cheap to continue getting

27:39.763 --> 27:43.247
data. I'm glad to see that they still try to get data 
from the voyages. that are near the, what is it, the

27:48.209 --> 27:54.818
magnetopause of the solar system, and even now 
finding out new things. Getting closer. However,

27:56.360 --> 28:03.470
I think there's a tradeoff between people who want 
to do new things and start new projects and people

27:56.360 --> 28:03.470
who want to get full value for projects already 
existing. And I think you will always see this

28:03.510 --> 28:06.994
throughout human history in any field. And the 
question is, is there going to be an equilibrium

28:07.695 --> 28:13.363
line where everybody's going to be happy? No. But 
my personal opinion is I would have liked to have

28:14.384 --> 28:17.929
seen more support for reduction and careful 
analysis of data that had already been obtained.

28:28.884 --> 28:38.053
We found out a lot of things about the planets and 
the solar system in general since the space age

28:28.884 --> 28:38.053
began, both from space and from the ground. Can you 
give a general idea of what planetary astronomy

28:39.415 --> 28:47.443
has done? thing like, well, we now know there's 
more than one kind of planet, or some statement

28:47.879 --> 28:53.006
like that. I'm leaving it vague so you can make up 
what you want to say. Well, one surprise for me was

28:57.253 --> 29:01.899
to see the craters on absolutely everything 
without an atmosphere in the solar system. I mean,

29:01.959 --> 29:08.469
craters in the backside of Mercury, craters in the 
satellites of Saturn, craters everywhere. I

29:08.529 --> 29:15.439
thought the moon had a corner on the crater market 
before the advent of the space program. This has

29:15.790 --> 29:28.226
really hammered home how the planetesimals were 
flying around in the early days of the solar system

29:15.790 --> 29:28.226
when it was being formed, and has really 
illuminated the conditions and the formation of

29:15.790 --> 29:28.226
the solar system. We also now have a much better 
idea of what the primordial solar nebula must have

29:28.786 --> 29:44.346
been like based on isotope studies of the 
terrestrial planets and studies of the outer

29:28.786 --> 29:44.346
planets, and most recently with the composition 
of Pluto and Triton are only real keys to what the

29:28.786 --> 29:44.346
solar was out in the outer solar system, inside the 
orb belt and such. So I think we have a much better

29:51.429 --> 29:58.957
idea of how the solar system formed and the planets 
formed, although a lot of unanswered questions.

30:00.458 --> 30:04.102
How atmospheres formed and evolved and how 
secondary atmospheres developed. I think we have

30:05.223 --> 30:14.012
much, much better idea in the geology of the 
surfaces of bodies, satellites, terrestrial

30:05.223 --> 30:14.012
bodies throughout the solar system than we had 
before. We have deeper insights into the

30:15.207 --> 30:33.125
cryogenic atmospheres of Mars, Triton, and 
Pluto, planets whose atmospheres are controlled

30:15.207 --> 30:33.125
by the vapor pressure of ices on their surface, and 
how these atmospheres might vary with seasons. We

30:34.867 --> 30:43.476
have a whole lot better idea of what the detailed 
composition of even complex organics are in

30:34.867 --> 30:43.476
places like Titan, Jupiter, Saturn. even Venus. 
We have so much data. Often we have the situation

30:49.950 --> 30:54.817
when you answer one question, it raises two more 
questions. And I think we've been running on a roll

30:54.877 --> 30:57.060
unlike that. I think we're still in the situation. 
Yes, we've learned an awful lot, but now we

30:58.643 --> 31:05.733
recognize there's so much we don't understand, 
and we would like to get some more answers. How much

31:07.556 --> 31:10.560
of an effect do you think The fact that we haven't 
found any traces of life anywhere else in the solar

31:12.093 --> 31:25.469
system but Earth, and in particular not on Mars, 
how much do you think that affected funding and

31:12.093 --> 31:25.469
public interest for planetary astronomy? Oddly 
enough, when I mentioned Horowitz experiments

31:25.489 --> 31:38.505
for detecting life on Mars, explaining how 
difficult it is to design an experiment to detect

31:25.489 --> 31:38.505
life without making assumptions in what form that 
life takes, I find that people are actually turned

31:40.544 --> 31:48.356
on by the search for life. They're not turned off by 
the failure so far to discover life. They're

31:53.143 --> 31:57.830
fascinated by how would you design an experiment 
to detect life in general? I mean, not life as we

31:58.271 --> 31:59.372
know it. And the fascination, for example, that of 
all the possible amino acids, only about half of

32:00.474 --> 32:07.665
them have been found on Earth. another one of those 
26 or 28 were found elsewhere and not found on

32:09.046 --> 32:16.653
Earth, that would imply independent origin of 
life. They still seem to find that fascinating. I

32:19.055 --> 32:24.760
don't really see a lot of people turned off by the 
failure so far to detect life. I see them almost

32:25.400 --> 32:32.606
eagerly accepting the challenge to search in more 
creative ways for it. It may not exist on Mars, but

32:33.607 --> 32:36.350
maybe it once did. If so, what was it like? Could 
there be fossilized evidence of that sitting

32:38.577 --> 32:43.563
somewhere in the Martian rocks? People seem to be 
fascinated by questions like that and would like

32:44.083 --> 32:48.448
to see the answers.

32:53.935 --> 32:58.460
I think, go ahead, what you just said. Harland 
Smith is the best money raiser I've ever known.

33:02.320 --> 33:17.234
Back in the, especially in the first 10 years that 
I've been at UT, he, more than anybody else, has

33:02.320 --> 33:17.234
been enormously successful in raising money and 
going and personally talking to members of

33:02.320 --> 33:17.234
Congress and lobbying for astronomy and for space 
astronomy in particular. In fact, when I first

33:17.735 --> 33:28.885
came to Texas, he told me the two things he wanted to 
accomplish at UT was to develop a first-class

33:17.735 --> 33:28.885
astronomy department and to introduce it into 
space exploration and research. In the final

33:30.232 --> 33:34.618
years, we were trying to raise money for the big 
telescopes. He wasn't quite as successful. Yeah,

33:36.501 --> 33:42.089
the 300-inch came awful close, I guess, the last 
hour of the legislature or something. But it

33:42.109 --> 33:45.795
seemed like he had a magic touch in those first 10 or 
15 years. Well, it certainly helps if you can raise

33:48.178 --> 33:50.161
money. Yes.
