00:01.128 --> 00:04.191
Chapter one entitled Childhood and Before. One of 
the birthrights of someone born in 1932 is the

00:06.313 --> 00:18.164
qualification as a depression baby.

00:21.087 --> 00:30.055
On April 26, 1932,

00:21.087 --> 00:30.055
Margie Margaret Pressman, my mother, had her 
third boy.

00:33.190 --> 00:38.237
Her father, Will Presnell, was a merchant, 
farmer, and postmaster.

00:40.960 --> 00:59.265
The home that we lived in was next door to a country 
store that was more or less a company store for the

00:40.960 --> 00:59.265
farmers that lived on the land of my grandfather as 
sharecroppers.

01:01.743 --> 01:21.947
At one time there were over 20 families that lived 
on the farm, farming cotton and corn on relatively

01:01.743 --> 01:21.947
small acreage since it was all done with horses and 
mules and was prior to there being any tractor

01:01.743 --> 01:21.947
power.

01:21.968 --> 01:28.155
The sharecroppers farmed their crops on what they 
called a third and fourth basis, or on the halves.

01:35.498 --> 01:49.350
If you owned your own equipment and owned your own 
mules, then you farmed the land as a sharecropper

01:35.498 --> 01:49.350
and gave the landlord one third of the corn and one 
fourth of the cotton. If the landlord had to

01:49.370 --> 01:58.598
furnish these implements of the husbandry, then 
the sharecropper received half of the corn and

01:49.370 --> 01:58.598
half of the cotton. Most all of the land was farmed 
and was either in cotton or corn, and very little of

02:00.788 --> 02:08.320
it was in cattle.

02:11.845 --> 02:22.982
Not a great deal is remembered about my childhood 
days, but I do recall seeing my father very angry at

02:11.845 --> 02:22.982
one time. In fact, probably the only time that I can 
recall, with the exception of one other time

02:29.999 --> 02:37.786
through the radio that we were listening

02:29.999 --> 02:37.786
to. As I say, that was during the New Deal days when I 
was a child and there were federal programs to try

02:37.806 --> 02:49.237
to get the country back on its feet. There was 
little money and what little there was was

02:49.257 --> 02:56.884
furnished by federal programs and one of the 
programs where my father was trying to help out the

02:57.590 --> 03:00.314
sharecroppers. He advanced them some funds based 
on the fact that they would get some federal funds.

03:06.744 --> 03:11.151
And when the money came in, he took the money. The 
federal bureaucrats considered this wrong and

03:13.434 --> 03:21.827
threatened to take some action. And he was very 
upset with sharecroppers that were

03:24.168 --> 03:37.404
participating in such a activity since he was out 
of the goodness of his heart was trying to help.

03:37.424 --> 03:51.340
My father, Will Presnell, was a very patient man 
and many people say that I am much like my father in

03:37.424 --> 03:51.340
that I show a great deal of patience when times are 
difficult.

03:54.712 --> 04:03.481
A very trying period of time for my mother 
particularly was when I was about two and a half

03:54.712 --> 04:03.481
years old. I fell off the front porch and broke my 
leg in the upper portion of the thigh portion and

04:04.462 --> 04:21.019
was taken to the hospital and the leg was put in a 
cast. The leg grew back But it was not straight. And

04:27.861 --> 04:54.655
the doctor gave my mother and father the choice of 
either letting it stay like that or breaking it

04:27.861 --> 04:54.655
over, hoping that the break would be in the right 
place and that the leg would be OK. My mother

04:27.861 --> 04:54.655
primarily made the choice of re-breaking the leg 
and hoping that it would break right and could be

04:27.861 --> 04:54.655
reset.

04:56.002 --> 05:00.406
It worked out fine, and I had never had any problems 
with it. The problem with the leg was the fact that

05:00.426 --> 05:20.185
the fracture was so high close to my hip that both 
legs should have been suspended with a pulley as I

05:00.426 --> 05:20.185
lay flat on my back. And the doctor only suspended 
one leg. And as a result, when I twisted and turned,

05:24.014 --> 05:39.494
that got the fracture grew back and was not in 
properly positioned. So I have my mother

05:39.514 --> 05:45.842
primarily to thank for the fact that I did not have 
to grow up as a cripple. In addition to my

05:48.325 --> 05:53.532
grandfather's extensive farming operations 
through sharecroppers, My father had his own

05:54.355 --> 06:03.103
tracts of land and some farming was done primarily 
on the haves. And so my father spent much of the time

06:05.085 --> 06:22.000
after things settled down and were not so busy in 
the store,

06:05.085 --> 06:22.000
out overseeing the farming operations. while I 
stayed in the store and ran the store. It would have

06:27.725 --> 06:34.072
been impossible in my early days to do that because 
the store was very active. It had over seven

06:34.513 --> 06:46.166
employees and sold everything that you could 
imagine that was needed to run a household and to

06:34.513 --> 06:46.166
run a farm. As I became a teenager, all the 
sharecroppers virtually were gone, had moved to

06:46.186 --> 06:52.273
town. and the land was converted primarily to 
cattle operations. There was some farming, but it

06:59.227 --> 07:03.492
was done with tractors. At the tender age of six, 
when I entered public schools, there was a school

07:03.512 --> 07:09.699
just up the road. At that time, it taught all 11 
grades. The high school did not have a 12th grade as

07:14.565 --> 07:18.930
it does today. It was a rural school called Tabor 
High School.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.562
It was a wonderful experience with some great 
teachers. Although it was small and the teaching

07:30.445 --> 07:44.423
staff was only about seven or eight teachers, they 
were all very confident and did an excellent job of

07:30.445 --> 07:44.423
giving the children the background that they 
needed. I recall about the second grade, a cyclone

07:45.925 --> 07:51.673
or tornado hit the school building and virtually 
knocked it off of its props. It was up in the air on

07:58.233 --> 08:05.342
stilts almost with brick columns. I remember that 
we could walk under the school building, most of

08:05.363 --> 08:19.602
it, and so it was not destroyed but made inoperable 
by knocking it off its props, so to speak. That led

08:22.349 --> 08:33.121
to building another school building and, in the 
process, added an auditorium and gymnasium. And

08:33.722 --> 08:41.210
for the first time, we were able to participate in 
sports, primarily volleyball and basketball,

08:33.722 --> 08:41.210
indoors. Up to that time, basketball was played on 
the outside on gravel courts and could really skin

08:42.912 --> 08:49.960
up your knees. I was a little young at that time and 
was fortunate enough to do most of my basketball

08:50.851 --> 09:16.109
playing after the new gymnasium was completed and 
enjoyed participating in that sport, although I

08:50.851 --> 09:16.109
was usually playing with much older boys and 
bigger boys and got to participate very little in

08:50.851 --> 09:16.109
this varsity sport. I got to ride the bench a lot, 
but played very little.

09:23.875 --> 09:28.902
When the tornado hit, it was very unexpected. We 
did not have the warning facilities that are

09:28.982 --> 09:36.251
available today. And it was very fortunate that no 
one was hurt. After all, there were over 100

09:44.001 --> 09:52.853
children in the school building, and there was one 
long porch that fell to the ground. But as I say, no

09:56.013 --> 09:59.896
one was hurt, and all except the small ones. And I 
was in that category. Went to the ditches and laid

10:04.200 --> 10:07.504
down in the ditches until it had passed.

10:10.166 --> 10:18.734
It's one of those events that many adults today 
still remember where they were when the tornado

10:10.166 --> 10:18.734
hit the school. Within a few years, Tabor High 
School began to move some of its grades to Bryan

10:23.579 --> 10:31.008
High School. For example, the high school was run 
away with first and integrated with Bryan,

10:31.889 --> 10:50.070
leaving the other nine grades in the school at 
Tabor.

10:50.090 --> 10:51.932
The year I was in the sixth grade, The upper grades 
from the fifth on were abolished, so I entered

10:52.975 --> 11:06.409
Lamar Junior High School in Bryan on the seventh 
grade level.

11:09.172 --> 11:21.345
This was a good experience, although most of the 
families and kids in my class were not happy with it

11:09.172 --> 11:21.345
because they really wanted to stay in a small rural 
school. Frankly, it was not a challenge. It was

11:27.277 --> 11:30.200
probably too easy to pass. And it was time that we 
needed the challenge of a school system such as

11:31.762 --> 11:41.452
Bryan had to offer. Moving to the Bryan schools 
also brought about a different mix of students as

11:50.063 --> 11:54.890
opposed to the ones that attended the Tabor 
school. The Tabor school was sprinkled pretty

11:54.910 --> 12:09.292
heavily with first generation Italians that 
lived in the area between Tabor and Bryan and were

11:54.910 --> 12:09.292
still farming the land. I recall quite vividly 
that many of these kids could not start the school

12:10.333 --> 12:18.906
until about a month after began in September 
because of the fact that they had to pick cotton

12:19.358 --> 12:33.193
during the month of September and they would 
finally be able to come to school for the first time

12:19.358 --> 12:33.193
around the first of October. So things were kind of 
held back waiting for these kids to get in school

12:34.094 --> 12:42.984
and allow them an opportunity to catch up. But this 
was just the times we lived in where kids were

12:43.004 --> 12:49.011
necessary labor to pick the cotton that was grazed 
on their farms. For a while, I lost track of some of

12:57.390 --> 13:11.328
these kids that I went to school with, but began to 
run into them again when I engaged in my first

12:57.390 --> 13:11.328
political campaign in 1968. Most of them had 
stayed in Bryan. Many of them were running

13:15.073 --> 13:18.137
convenience stores and were small 
entrepreneurs, and they were in a position to be a

13:18.657 --> 13:29.511
great help, and they were certainly good friends 
that I'll always remember. There were many

13:31.233 --> 13:33.295
influences on my life. One was the 4-H Club that I 
joined when I was just nine years of age, and I was

13:35.278 --> 13:47.533
able to travel to Dallas and to Houston to those 
livestock shows and show some of my livestock over

13:48.070 --> 13:54.799
the years that I was raising. This was a good 
experience and one that I'll always treasure. The

14:02.068 --> 14:15.765
reason it was such a good experience was because of 
the great leadership that Wallace Kimbrough, who

14:02.068 --> 14:15.765
was the county agent for most of those years, 
furnished the program. I'll always remember Mr.

14:17.382 --> 14:37.199
Kimbrough and we hope that his memory will stay 
alive for years to come through a scholarship

14:17.382 --> 14:37.199
program that my brother and I and several others 
started for him in his name at Texas A&M

14:17.382 --> 14:37.199
University. The scholarship is awarded each year 
at the annual awards program of the Brazos County

14:37.219 --> 14:47.068
4-H club and provided to the student that 
demonstrates

14:47.470 --> 15:05.358
scholarship, leadership, and judging ability. 
One of the programs that Mr. Kimbrough started

15:05.378 --> 15:14.993
that had an impact on the lives of many of us was the 
livestock judging programs. I recall I placed

15:16.310 --> 15:28.801
first in a dairy judging contest at the Houston 
Flat Stock Show and Livestock Show one year and won

15:16.310 --> 15:28.801
a dairy heifer. That probably

15:29.842 --> 15:43.515
increased my interest in the dairy industry as a 
result of winning that heifer and having to go back

15:29.842 --> 15:43.515
and show it at the Livestock Show the next year. As a 
youngster, I was extremely shy, but I had a strong

15:45.149 --> 15:59.847
compulsion to join the Methodist Church and 
accept Jesus Christ as my personal Savior at an

15:45.149 --> 15:59.847
early age. However, because of my shyness, I 
resisted a number of times when the invitation was

16:00.948 --> 16:09.198
offered. Finally, we had an elderly pastor by the 
name of Reverend Day who took me fishing one

16:15.676 --> 16:30.418
afternoon and it helped overcome some of my 
timidity and so the next Sunday when the

16:15.676 --> 16:30.418
invitation was offered I went forward and joined 
the church. For some reason it became easier after

16:31.199 --> 16:39.532
I had had an opportunity to go fishing with 
Reverend Day. In high school I joined the Future

16:44.701 --> 16:54.193
Farmers of America and continued my interest in 
agriculture, but never left the 4-H club. There

16:54.253 --> 17:13.999
was some school of thought that a person should 
devote all of his time to one or the other, and in

16:54.253 --> 17:13.999
many areas this was emphasized and encouraged, 
but I was never encouraged to leave the 4-H club and

16:54.253 --> 17:13.999
devote all of my time to Future Farmers of America. 
In hindsight, I think this was a good thing because

17:14.890 --> 17:25.041
each one of them offered different opportunities 
during my high school days. The Future Farmers of

17:25.061 --> 17:39.396
America offered more opportunity for leadership 
training, which I found very helpful for the rest

17:25.061 --> 17:39.396
of my life, particularly during the years I served 
in the legislature. Upon entering high school, I

17:43.257 --> 17:53.211
participated in a calf scramble as a member of the 
Future Farmers of America and went on the next year

17:43.257 --> 17:53.211
to win Grand Champion. I did not get much in the way 
of remuneration for my award, but it was a lot of

17:54.152 --> 18:04.767
fun. In fact, I recall the calf brought 36 cents a 
pound which was not much money now and was

18:10.257 --> 18:19.225
certainly not much money even then for a Grand 
Champion keg. As a 4-H'er in 1949, I entered the

18:19.245 --> 18:37.682
dairy judging contest in Houston, as I mentioned 
earlier, and won a dairy heifer fair as a result of

18:19.245 --> 18:37.682
winning being number one in the judging contest. 
This was quite an accomplishment at the time

18:42.229 --> 18:52.501
because there were several hundred 4-H'ers that 
were entered in the judging contest. Later on, our

18:54.123 --> 19:07.298
team won state judging in, in dairy judging in 
1949, and we had an opportunity to go to the

18:54.123 --> 19:07.298
national contest in Memphis, Tennessee. And this 
was probably my first trip outside of the state of

19:08.071 --> 19:12.075
Texas. And it was very enjoyable. We traveled with 
the state winning FFA team that was out of

19:14.197 --> 19:21.125
Burleson, Texas. And I still see occasionally one 
of those judging team members who is a member of the

19:22.126 --> 19:32.897
faculty in the University of Mississippi. That 
same year, I entered Texas A&M as a freshman

19:35.037 --> 19:46.427
student and, of course, entered the Corps of 
Cadets. The freshmen at that time were stationed

19:47.689 --> 19:59.720
at what is now known as the Riverside Campus of 
Texas A&M University on Highway 21 just west of

19:47.689 --> 19:59.720
Bryan. It was an old Air Force base that had been 
abandoned and turned over to Texas A&M. We lived in

20:07.606 --> 20:16.535
barracks, about 20 to each barrack, and it was not 
the best of conditions for studying and getting

20:07.606 --> 20:16.535
rest. But we had a lot of fun, and I managed to make my 
grades, although many of the fellows that I was in

20:17.336 --> 20:32.112
the same barracks with flunked out after one 
semester, or at least the second semester. At the

20:33.661 --> 20:46.094
end of that freshman year, it was necessary to 
select the branch of service that we wanted to

20:33.661 --> 20:46.094
continue our military experience with. I 
selected the US Air Force and continued my

20:47.495 --> 20:57.385
training, ROTC training, in the Air Force ROTC.

21:00.708 --> 21:02.470
At the end of the first semester, I had decided to 
move home because of the fact that I had a rather

21:02.973 --> 21:18.352
large project of egg production. This was putting 
me through school but was certainly a burden to my

21:18.392 --> 21:30.567
mother who was having to take care of them while I 
was living out at the O'Brien Air Force Base. or

21:31.340 --> 21:49.365
they called it then the annex, I felt like I could be 
of some service by being at home and traveling back

21:31.340 --> 21:49.365
and forth and at least marketing the eggs and from 
time to time helping with tending to my laying

21:31.340 --> 21:49.365
hens.

21:52.789 --> 21:59.018
It is amazing now to look back how profitable the 
egg production operation was. by today's

21:59.453 --> 22:03.478
standards, very small, but at that time was rather 
large. In fact, there was only one or two

22:04.359 --> 22:10.907
operations in the county that were larger than 
mine. I look back at the records that I kept at that

22:12.669 --> 22:23.342
time were at the peak of the laying season. I was 
netting as much as a dollar per chicken per month

22:29.592 --> 22:58.333
this would be unbelievable by today's standards 
in 1950 we all moved to the main campus since only

22:29.592 --> 22:58.333
freshmen were at the annex and that same year the 
annex was closed we were the last class to be at the

22:29.592 --> 22:58.333
annex and incidentally the annex was placed there 
because of the hazing problems that existed on the

22:58.988 --> 23:00.629
campus. And the thought was that if they could 
separate the freshmen out for four years, that

23:01.550 --> 23:14.201
there would be little or no hazing at Texas A&M in 
the Corps of Cadets. Frankly, it didn't work that

23:15.302 --> 23:16.803
way. There still was hazing. But it probably 
helped to change the attitudes of some of the

23:18.584 --> 23:28.793
cadets through the separation that we 
experienced.

23:32.401 --> 23:51.286
I decided early on to major in dairy science since I 
had been involved with my dairy project, and my

23:32.401 --> 23:51.286
father by then had entered the dairy business with 
his brother, Charlie Preston. The dairy was

23:53.489 --> 24:01.159
located close to or on the land that I now own. Now, 
one of the people that had a great influence on my

24:03.333 --> 24:20.033
life was the vocational agriculture teacher and 
the sponsor of Future Farmers of America in Brown

24:03.333 --> 24:20.033
for many years, Mr. J.C. Dooley. I got much of my 
leadership training through the Future Farmer

24:20.054 --> 24:25.140
program. I served as secretary and president of 
the local chapter. Had a long time experience with

24:32.206 --> 24:49.503
Mr. Dooley when I later joined the Young Farmers 
Association as a charter member and as its charter

24:32.206 --> 24:49.503
president here in Bryan.

24:49.523 --> 24:58.973
It was no surprise to anyone, I'm sure, that I 
selected the field of agriculture and I decided on

24:49.523 --> 24:58.973
a degree plan at Texas A&M. However, as a senior in 
Bryan High School, I really became interested in

24:59.948 --> 25:06.178
two other fields. First, I enjoyed designing 
house plans, and so architecture was a strong

25:06.218 --> 25:14.671
consideration for a long time. I also considered 
the School of Veterinary Medicine. But in both

25:21.060 --> 25:27.390
cases, the programs were more than four years, and 
as a result, Maybe just due to laziness, I decided I

25:27.657 --> 25:39.367
wanted a four-year program and chose not to select 
either one of those programs.

25:39.387 --> 25:57.242
I would be remiss not to mention some of my boyhood

25:39.387 --> 25:57.242
acquaintances during the time that I was growing 
up at Tabor, where I had lived all of my life.

25:58.943 --> 26:09.879
mentioned earlier, we lived close to the school 
where there was a home called the teacherage that

25:58.943 --> 26:09.879
was provided the school principal. He had two sons 
who were close to my age. One was in my grade, and we

26:14.186 --> 26:19.434
played together. The one my age is now a minister of 
education. at the First Baptist Church in

26:24.290 --> 26:34.219
Harlingen, Texas, and we have maintained

26:24.290 --> 26:34.219
some communication over the years. Another 
neighbor just down the road on the other side of my

26:35.401 --> 26:53.037
home

26:35.401 --> 26:53.037
was a boy named Elvin Barnes, and we were together 
almost constantly. Elvin's father was a

26:55.407 --> 27:03.836
blacksmith and I guess that may have contributed 
to my interest in tinkering. We were always up to

27:05.798 --> 27:08.882
something. I recall one time we took a starter 
motor off of an old truck that my father owned and

27:08.902 --> 27:23.878
mounted it on a wagon and were going to run the 
starter motor with a battery. So it would

27:24.533 --> 27:28.237
essentially have been a battery-powered car.

27:31.040 --> 27:51.942
This possibly is where my first tinkering with 
things started, and I have been accused by a former

27:31.040 --> 27:51.942
chancellor of the Texas University System of 
enjoying tinkering with legislation,

27:31.040 --> 27:51.942
or as he referred to it, being the fiddler in the 
band. I'm sure there are many other traits that I

27:54.233 --> 28:07.770
picked up in those early boyhood, high school, 
college days that contributed to my adulthood.

28:08.732 --> 28:13.097
They're sometimes very difficult to identify all 
of them. But I'm sure that my opportunity to

28:13.117 --> 28:22.890
conduct meetings and provide some leadership 
helped when I entered the legislature and was

28:23.528 --> 28:28.736
given leadership responsibilities there. I know 
that it made a difference in my confidence level to

28:29.718 --> 28:47.626
conduct meetings and to arrive at consensus views 
with my colleagues in the legislature and to get

28:29.718 --> 28:47.626
things done that had to be done. All of these 
Experiences and training helped overcome the shy

28:48.824 --> 29:08.200
person that I was, but I'm not sure that I totally 
overcame my shyness except for the short period of

28:48.824 --> 29:08.200
time that I had to run for office in 1968. and I 
probably reverted back to some of it even after

29:09.648 --> 29:17.417
that event took place. One of the opportunities 
that I was provided during my boyhood days was a

29:18.519 --> 29:27.410
chance to read quite a bit in the summer months. At 
that time, the county provided a bookmobile that

29:28.411 --> 29:38.423
went around the to the rural counties, rural 
communities, and provided a library, moving

29:39.247 --> 29:49.301
library. And so one day each week, the bookmobile 
would park in front of our store, which was next

29:50.362 --> 30:00.075
door to our home. And I had the opportunity to check 
out a book. turn in the ones that I had previously

30:05.065 --> 30:15.417
checked out, and read the book before the 
bookmobile returned the next week. If it had not

30:15.437 --> 30:23.026
been for the bookmobile, I probably would have not 
read as much as I did during those summer months.

30:23.826 --> 30:34.819
I'm sure all of that reading was helpful to me in my 
schoolwork and giving me more ability to read.

30:36.419 --> 30:50.919
Another educational opportunity that was 
afforded was through the phonics program that was

30:36.419 --> 30:50.919
just being developed when I was a second grader. 
And one of the originators of the phonics program

30:51.980 --> 31:04.097
came to our school from College Station and taught 
phonics to us. I will always believe that had a

31:04.567 --> 31:14.681
great deal to do with my ability to sound out almost 
any word and to spell virtually any word.

31:15.523 --> 31:23.153
Sometimes it doesn't quite work out 
phonetically, but most of the time it does. And I am

31:23.174 --> 31:32.667
a strong believer that phonics contributed a 
great deal to my educational progress.

31:35.583 --> 31:43.983
Throughout those boyhood days, it seemed that 
opportunities were always presenting

31:35.583 --> 31:43.983
themselves just at the right time. And I'll always 
be grateful and feel quite fortunate that things

31:44.664 --> 31:50.859
worked out as they did. It was good to live in a rural 
community to have a rural background and to

31:54.635 --> 32:07.247
experience those things that only someone raised 
in a rural area can experience. At the same time, I

32:07.267 --> 32:15.595
got a good education through the Bryan system, 
which was known as one of the best in the state at the

32:07.267 --> 32:15.595
time. And so many things that happened that people 
that came my way that I will always be grateful

32:25.297 --> 32:30.002
This is chapter two, which will deal with my 
ancestry.

32:33.786 --> 32:53.768
I do not wish to reiterate a lot of work that has been 
done on the genealogy of the two branches of the

32:33.786 --> 32:53.768
family of my mother and father, but I would like to 
give some information that may not show up on any of

32:54.102 --> 33:00.213
the genealogy work that has been done. Both my 
mother and father were from pioneer families that

33:00.233 --> 33:15.840
helped settle Brazos County, and I think that some 
of this is worth mentioning because it gave them

33:00.233 --> 33:15.840
very strong ties to this area and relationship 
with many people both through family, kinship,

33:16.377 --> 33:33.276
and friends that influenced my life a great deal. 
On my mother's side of the family, her grandmother

33:34.678 --> 33:44.629
was of a Kurd family that settled in the Kurd 
community on a grant that had been provided by

33:45.183 --> 33:49.970
Stephen F. Austin. They probably would have 
stayed there for generations to come, but started

33:49.990 --> 34:14.987
feuding with the Millicans on the southern end of 
the county, and as a result, one of the Kurd boys

33:49.990 --> 34:14.987
shot one of the Millican boys, and their land at 
Curtin had to be sold to defend the Kurd boy and keep

34:15.608 --> 34:21.634
him out of prison. It seems very strange and ironic 
and I don't know the explanation for it, but years

34:21.654 --> 34:39.392
later the two families made up and the Kurd family 
moved to Milliken and were sponsored by the

34:21.654 --> 34:39.392
Milliken family. This moved my grandmother 
closer to where My grandfather was being raised by

34:45.005 --> 34:55.217
the Clay family in Clay Station, just on the other 
side of the Brazos River. Little is known about my

34:56.559 --> 35:14.100
grandfather on my mother's side, except that he 
was raised by the Clay family and was given to the

34:56.559 --> 35:14.100
family, provided to the family, maybe is a better 
word, in St. Louis, Missouri. The Clay family was

35:18.971 --> 35:29.885
very good to him, and this is indicated by the fact 
that he stayed with the family until he was 24. He

35:30.205 --> 35:36.193
could have left under the arrangement that they 
had at the age of 21.

35:39.057 --> 35:42.501
Some of the more pleasant experiences that my 
mother remembered was having been raised as a

35:43.730 --> 35:57.064
child where the Texas World Speedway is now 
established.

35:57.124 --> 36:00.207
My mother had two brothers and four sisters. The 
two brothers were Lewis Marquette, was a

36:02.229 --> 36:10.918
carpenter in Houston, and lost a hand in an 
accidental gun discharge while he was home on

36:11.287 --> 36:14.611
leave during World War I. Uncle Lewis had two boys 
that still live in Houston. The other brother was

36:23.600 --> 36:26.744
Seth, known as Bud Marquardt.

36:29.427 --> 36:39.758
Uncle Bud was a carpenter that lived in the either 
Bryan College Station or Navistota during his

36:29.427 --> 36:39.758
lifetime.

36:44.750 --> 36:52.041
Uncle Bud is the only one that's still alive at the 
time I am recording this. The oldest sister was

36:52.061 --> 37:03.258
Lena Allen, whose husband was Eddie Allen, a 
landowner of some renown in the Peach Creek

36:52.061 --> 37:03.258
community. Uncle Eddie was known to buy land that 
joined him and that he accumulated a great deal of

37:07.210 --> 37:14.917
property over the years. Aunt Lena and Uncle Ebby 
had ten children and Uncle Ebby's ambition was to

37:16.819 --> 37:37.217
leave each one of them a thousand acres and a 
hundred head of cattle and he accomplished this by

37:16.819 --> 37:37.217
accumulating ten thousand acres of land and a 
thousand head of cattle in the Beech Creek

37:16.819 --> 37:37.217
community just south of College Station. Some of 
those children still live in the Beach Creek and

37:39.577 --> 37:45.145
College Station community. Others have since 
moved away. Another large family was mother's

37:49.471 --> 37:58.383
sister, Liddy Arnold, who was married to Henry 
Arnold. Uncle Henry worked for Texas A&M, his

37:59.604 --> 38:08.757
adult life in the power plant, the home that they 
lived in that I recall other than the time they

38:09.226 --> 38:19.721
lived in Wilburn is where the Central Park and 
College Station is located. The pavilion has a

38:21.543 --> 38:30.956
plaque recognizing the family's residence there 
in the park where the pavilion is. Two of Mother's

38:32.398 --> 38:37.866
sisters moved to the Baytown area

38:39.297 --> 38:46.604
When they married, or shortly after they married, 
Addie Baker married Uncle Raleigh Baker, and they

38:39.297 --> 38:46.604
had six children. They stayed in Milliken for a 
while, but he moved to Baytown. The family moved to

38:51.870 --> 39:05.423
Baytown when one of the older boys was six years of 
age, and he worked for Humble Oil and Refining

38:51.870 --> 39:05.423
Company for the rest of his life. My family was 
probably closer to the Baker family than any of the

39:07.310 --> 39:12.417
others. We paired off quite well in age and the fact 
that there was one about the same age in each family

39:13.940 --> 39:30.804
and of the same sex.

39:30.824 --> 39:35.190
The Baker that was my age was Charles Baker, who was 
now an orthopedic surgeon in Houston, Texas.

39:44.281 --> 39:48.465
The oldest son of the Baker family was R.W. Baker, 
who was quite instrumental in the fact that he was

39:48.485 --> 40:04.941
involved in political endeavors much of his life 
and got me interested in an indirect way in

39:48.485 --> 40:04.941
politics. In addition to that, he came to Bryan one 
day and wanted to start a local bank. And we decided

40:15.092 --> 40:19.038
on a location in College Station. It became known 
as Commerce National Bank and is now known as

40:20.079 --> 40:24.707
Compass Bank. And this has been quite an 
experience in developing the bank. We ended up

40:30.255 --> 40:32.599
buying out the Baker family several years after 
the bank was started. R.W.' 's interest in

40:39.136 --> 40:50.267
politics was right after the war, came back and ran 
for state representative in Houston. He was

40:50.287 --> 41:02.940
defeated in that first race, but came back to be 
elected later and served in the House for several

40:50.287 --> 41:02.940
sessions before he, several terms before he was 
elected as the lone state senator for Harris

41:03.460 --> 41:06.003
County. After serving only about one term in the 
state senate, he decided to run for lieutenant

41:07.285 --> 41:13.653
governor. He entered a race and would have won the 
race probably had there been a decent turnout that

41:14.854 --> 41:25.688
day in Houston, Texas. The turnout was very low 
and, as a result, was defeated by a very, very small

41:26.680 --> 41:39.912
margin by the person who later became governor, 
Preston Smith. R.W. would probably have been the

41:40.372 --> 41:50.902
first Aggie governor had it not been for that slim 
margin of defeat back in about 1972. I'm sorry, 62,

41:50.922 --> 41:56.367
62.

41:57.578 --> 42:02.243
My involvement in that race I will discuss later. 
Mother's youngest sister I knew as Aunt Bitt. Her

42:09.710 --> 42:10.791
last name was Taylor. She was married to Hoyt 
Taylor, and they lived in Pelley, Texas, which is

42:11.372 --> 42:16.757
now a part of Baytown. She had two boys and one girl,

42:16.777 --> 42:25.206
Hoyt Jr., Jimmy, and June Marie. The two boys

42:26.502 --> 42:35.733
had lived their lives in Bryan College Station in 
June Marie. He is married and lives in Austin,

42:36.654 --> 42:40.238
Texas. Turning to my father's side of the family, a 
little bit more is known because of his

42:40.258 --> 42:53.573
grandfather's keeping of records that we still 
have to this day.

42:56.742 --> 43:06.676
Those old ledgers that we have in our possession 
date back to the early 1850s and run through 1882.

43:06.776 --> 43:25.922
His

43:06.776 --> 43:25.922
name was R. H. Hudspeth, and he, along with his 
brother T. H. Hudspeth, ran a general store in

43:06.776 --> 43:25.922
Wheelock, Texas in about...

43:30.087 --> 43:42.940
the early 1860s, he closed the store in Wheelock 
and joined the Confederate Army as a captain in the

43:30.087 --> 43:42.940
Hoods Brigade. And when he returned, he never 
opened the store, but moved in with his daughter,

43:44.182 --> 43:56.955
Mary, who was my grandmother.

43:59.534 --> 44:13.428
My father spent much time with his grandfather, 
R.H. Hudspeth, and he tells me that he was

43:59.534 --> 44:13.428
reluctant to talk about the Civil War. He was a 
scout and apparently had many experiences that he

44:14.610 --> 44:21.777
would just rather forget.

44:24.900 --> 44:27.583
I found this in one of the old ledgers He wrote in 
1869,

44:27.867 --> 44:45.604
after his service in the Hood Brigade, he wrote, 
quote, many men of many minds, many men of many

44:27.867 --> 44:45.604
kinds, and a good many of no minds at all. I'm not 
sure what this tells us about the man, but he

44:47.947 --> 44:53.352
apparently... able to overcome those 
experiences after a while and go on with his life.

44:59.765 --> 45:23.170
He purchased a rather large tract of land from a 
Colonel Giddings, or through Colonel Giddings,

44:59.765 --> 45:23.170
probably Giddings, Texas is named for, and

44:59.765 --> 45:23.170
began farming and ranching, primarily ranching 
in the Terrier area. I have 100 acres of that land

45:23.791 --> 45:25.953
today. At the time, he purchased about 2,000 acres 
from all indications of the records that I have. As

45:35.242 --> 45:44.251
I say, he kept extensive records, records such 
things as school attendance of the kids, bad

45:35.242 --> 45:44.251
weather days, the sickness of his employees.

45:46.513 --> 45:51.638
Interestingly enough, they seemed like the kids 
started to school at a very odd time of the year. But

45:52.563 --> 45:56.909
he kept a record of all these kinds of happenings. 
He raised a lot of sheep, hogs, and cattle. He had a

46:04.901 --> 46:08.746
lot of records of him paying sheep herders. They 
made $15 a month working full time as sheep

46:09.447 --> 46:13.393
herders. In 1871, he paid $15.37 in ad valorem 
taxes. This was for the 1,537 acres that he owned in

46:22.465 --> 46:29.453
the area where my farm is today. He had five horses, 
50 cows, 520 sheep, 25 hogs, one wagon, one bucky,

46:31.115 --> 46:39.725
and one bull.

46:43.410 --> 46:51.139
At the same time, the balance of it, there was some 
land that came up the total of 2,000 acres in the

46:43.410 --> 46:51.139
name of Mrs. M. M. Hudspeth. I'm not sure who M. M. 
Hudspeth is. She had 400 acres. And then Mrs. Mary

47:00.362 --> 47:05.188
Hudspeth had 212 acres. Mary Hudspeth was my 
grandmother. M. M. Hudspeth was probably another

47:10.535 --> 47:20.788
daughter that

47:10.535 --> 47:20.788
we know as the Hudspeth Prairie.
