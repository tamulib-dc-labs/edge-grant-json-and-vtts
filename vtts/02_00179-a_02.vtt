WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:05.610
Are we back on?

00:07.913 --> 00:14.881
I'm guessing this was probably about midway in 
that first semester because we were still there in

00:07.913 --> 00:14.881
dorm 12. It wasn't the second semester. So

00:17.524 --> 00:32.400
we determined that the best way to avoid waking 
them up, our plan was to fill up a couple of balloons

00:17.524 --> 00:32.400
with water. and we had run some tests to make sure 
this technique would work.

00:40.301 --> 00:55.538
You fill the balloon with water and you put warm 
water that's as close to body temperature as you

00:40.301 --> 00:55.538
can get it so that cold or hot wouldn't initially 
wake them up if they rolled over and touched the

00:40.301 --> 00:55.538
balloon before it went off. In order to fuse the 
balloon,

01:03.582 --> 01:14.583
take the end of it where you filled it and you twist 
it and twist it and twist it and turn it around so it

01:03.582 --> 01:14.583
holds against itself but you don't knot it. And we 
learned that that will give you about a 10 or 15

01:16.427 --> 01:23.380
minute fuse before the water pressure gradually 
unwinds that thing and then it starts to leak and

01:23.782 --> 01:27.906
that's going off. It doesn't explode or anything, 
it just starts to leak. That gives you some escape

01:32.951 --> 01:35.153
time. Nobody ever locked their rooms. In fact, a 
lot of times, especially in warm weather, the

01:41.339 --> 01:48.306
doors were either fully open or cracked open after 
guys went to bed. Maybe the windows opened to get

01:48.386 --> 01:51.949
some draft and some breeze through the rooms. This 
was pre-air conditioning days and so then once you

01:52.638 --> 02:17.110
get out you've got to secure the room where the guys 
can't if they do catch you or if you happen to wake

01:52.638 --> 02:17.110
them up so you got a little head start in case 
there's a chase and so you take a what we call a Jody

01:52.638 --> 02:17.110
stick made out of the end of a coke case And where the 
handle is on the end of that coat case, you cut a

02:17.815 --> 02:24.481
little notch in there that's big enough to fit over 
the doorknob handle. And you put that notch over

02:25.582 --> 02:34.871
the handle until the handle is in the center of the 
hand grip and then slide it to that one side. And

02:35.632 --> 02:42.839
from the outside, and there's no way anybody can 
get the door open until somebody comes and removes

02:35.632 --> 02:42.839
the Jody stick. So that was going to be our escape 
mechanism. And so we pulled it off, sneaked in, and

02:48.005 --> 03:03.543
of course our hearts were racing like 90 miles an 
hour as you slip into the room and you lay the water

02:48.005 --> 03:03.543
balloons very gently on the edge of the bed and then 
roll it into where it won't roll off. One on the top

03:05.005 --> 03:12.834
bunk, one on the bottom bunk, and we eased back out, 
closed the door, and then put the stick on it. And we

03:12.914 --> 03:16.138
did it stealthily enough that we were back in our 
room, right across the hall, and one of the reasons

03:16.962 --> 03:32.608
we were chosen, we kind of volunteered, but we were 
chosen to do this was because we didn't think that

03:16.962 --> 03:32.608
the psychological warfare that they would think 
that guys the closest to them would dare try

03:16.962 --> 03:32.608
something like this. And it wasn't necessarily as 
much for us as it was for some other of our

03:33.489 --> 03:41.923
classmates who were being really harassed.

03:43.338 --> 03:49.827
Anyway, we were back in bed and had had a chance to 
cool down a little bit before we heard the first

03:43.338 --> 03:49.827
scream. And then we heard the pounding on the door 
to wake people up. And then finally one of their

03:54.513 --> 04:06.109
buddies, probably McGee and Heron, got up and went 
over there and unjodied

03:54.513 --> 04:06.109
the door for them and let them out. And then all of a 
sudden, our door flew open.

04:12.852 --> 04:19.262
Two guys came in there and reached under the covers 
and put their hand on our heart to see if we had a high

04:12.852 --> 04:19.262
heartbeat.

04:21.786 --> 04:23.929
They said, Fishery, why is your heart beating so? I 
said, oh God, I feel like I'm being raped. What are

04:26.533 --> 04:27.675
you doing in here? Get away from me. At that point, I 
guess they had decided that our reaction was real

04:29.710 --> 04:42.824
and we were sleepy enough, we'd had enough 
cool-down time, that at that point they didn't

04:29.710 --> 04:42.824
suspect us. But he said, you better find out what 
happened tonight and you better make sure it never

04:42.844 --> 04:48.930
happens in your lifetime. And so they went out and I 
heard doors opening and they were checking out all

04:48.970 --> 04:58.300
the guys to try to find out who had a fast heartbeat 
or clammy skin or something. So we got away with it

04:58.280 --> 05:22.228
and I don't know if they accused somebody else or if 
they never found out but we had a couple of

04:58.280 --> 05:22.228
additional sophomore meetings and the next day or 
two and folks on the wall and a lot of intimidation

04:58.280 --> 05:22.228
and so forth to try to determine who had done that. 
Of course, our answer was, they're not being

05:22.647 --> 05:29.890
informed on the highest degree of accuracy.

05:30.663 --> 05:59.708
Anyway, we got away with that and that also helped 
relieve not only our stress and tension but some of

05:30.663 --> 05:59.708
our classmates and actually except for the day or 
two aftermath from the incident when they were

05:30.663 --> 05:59.708
really just livid and off the walls, they kind of 
calmed down and I kind of suspect that the juniors

05:30.663 --> 05:59.708
and seniors might have talked to them about 
whether they had been out of line or not and their

05:30.663 --> 05:59.708
behavior did settle down a little bit. describe 
the Babel bombing? The Babel bombing was against

06:02.726 --> 06:07.954
Tom Ralph rest his soul. He died in Vietnam. Thomas 
Ralph. He was a really gung-ho guy outspoken and

06:13.742 --> 06:19.590
boisterous. I mean he was well known throughout 
both the fish and sophomore. In fact, the whole

06:24.075 --> 06:25.877
community knew him. He was a yell leader his junior 
year. Maybe even his, did they have sophomore yell

06:27.759 --> 06:31.243
leaders that year? I don't remember, but he was, I 
think, elected a yell leader at his earliest

06:32.845 --> 06:46.421
opportunity and was really gung-ho, but he had a 
reputation for harassing the fish that went by his

06:32.845 --> 06:46.421
dorm. He lived over in dorm three and Since I was 
studying civil engineering, I had a lot of my

06:52.135 --> 07:01.206
classes over on the northeast corner of the 
campus. Now when I use references like east, west,

07:01.226 --> 07:19.527
north, south, I'm using that basically along the 
orientation of Highway 6, although I know Highway

07:01.226 --> 07:19.527
6 actually runs northwest and what we call the 
northeast corner of the campus was actually due

07:01.226 --> 07:19.527
north. from the central part of the campus. But 
anyway, we had a lot of classes over there. So we had

07:25.578 --> 07:28.791
to walk by the dorm. all of the dorms through the 
quadrangle. And it seemed like Ralph just made it a

07:32.118 --> 07:43.838
practice of standing out there or walking very 
slowly when he was on his way to class in order to

07:32.118 --> 07:43.838
encounter and harass as many freshmen as he could. 
And sometimes he was just absolutely unmerciful.

07:47.465 --> 07:49.969
I mean, he was worse than Dabney and Mahan. and it 
got to be a topic of conversation among the

07:50.759 --> 08:15.079
freshmen about how mean he was and so one night Earl 
and I looked at each other and said Ralph's gone too

07:50.759 --> 08:15.079
far he had harassed some of our guys really badly 
and so we got a cherry bomb To make a babbo bomb, you

08:15.852 --> 08:22.144
cut a little slit in the side of the full babbo can. 
You insert a cherry bomb, or what do we call it, M80

08:22.985 --> 08:37.793
or something, one of the larger size 
firecrackers, and you put it in there where just

08:22.985 --> 08:37.793
the fuse is sticking out. And then onto the fuse you 
take a cigarette and put it down so your cigarette

08:38.060 --> 08:47.234
is the slow fuse to give you a chance to get away. And 
you light the cigarette, you take several puffs on

08:48.656 --> 09:07.003
it and then put the opposite end on the fuse and then 
as the cigarette kind of burns itself down

08:48.656 --> 09:07.003
eventually it will get to the fuse and then the bomb 
goes off. and uh so we uh

09:07.507 --> 09:30.325
uh we got everything in place got the cigarette 
ready and we actually even had the cigarette lit

09:07.507 --> 09:30.325
before we went into the building because we knew we 
would have a lot of time and we didn't want to spend

09:07.507 --> 09:30.325
much time in there now this is what time of night 
this is probably about uh maybe two, three o'clock

09:30.507 --> 09:49.016
in the morning when everybody's really sound 
asleep and so we slipped over there and slipped

09:30.507 --> 09:49.016
into the building and fortunately Ralph was on the 
ground floor right

09:30.507 --> 09:49.016
near the side hallway. These dorms had a central 
hallway running the full length that all of the

09:50.298 --> 09:58.270
doors opened off of and then about a quarter or the 
third of the way down each of the dorms there was a

09:58.874 --> 10:28.543
side hallway that went out to the side entrance 
doors that opened onto the quadrangle and he lived

09:58.874 --> 10:28.543
very near that intersection of one of those side 
entrances so that made it also very now if he'd been

09:58.874 --> 10:28.543
on the fourth floor kind of in the middle of the 
hallway we might have had second thoughts about it

09:58.874 --> 10:28.543
but once we found knew where he lived we figured it 
was worth the risk And so once again we slipped in

10:28.928 --> 10:55.560
and we put the thing kind of out in the room but in 
kind of the back corner as far away from their bed as

10:28.928 --> 10:55.560
we could so that the cigarette smoke would have 
dissipated a little bit and wouldn't be

10:28.928 --> 10:55.560
something to cause them to wake up and left the 
thing kind of on the floor out in the corner. We

10:58.437 --> 11:07.131
wanted it kind of out in the middle of the, a little 
bit toward the middle of the room so it would have

10:58.437 --> 11:07.131
maximum effect in distributing the babbo around 
the room. And so, you know, once again in this case

11:07.151 --> 11:13.482
we left the door open again to dissipate the 
cigarette smoke. we just eased in as a matter of

11:13.681 --> 11:36.921
fact I don't remember which one of us placed it and 
which one of us stood guard but all you needed is one

11:13.681 --> 11:36.921
person as a lookout and one person just to go in and 
set it down turn around and ease back out and then

11:13.681 --> 11:36.921
escape and we got away and we were We were back in our 
dorm. We never even heard the explosion because we

11:39.387 --> 11:46.438
were back in our dorm at the far opposite corner of 
the quadrangle. But we heard the next day from our

11:47.178 --> 11:57.133
fish buddies that, hey, y'all here, Tom Ralph got 
Babel Obama. Oh, really? Well, can't think of a

11:58.515 --> 12:00.438
more deserving guy. We just played innocent and 
never admitted to anyone, at least for several

12:00.558 --> 12:10.613
weeks, that we were the perpetrators. After 
those, you say for several weeks, what protected

12:11.515 --> 12:16.442
you after that? What kept the secret from getting 
back to him? Well, in the first place, we kind of

12:20.796 --> 12:30.987
hinted, just hinted that we might have, and even at 
that, only to other fish. And they never ratted?

12:35.492 --> 12:37.454
And they never ratted. And as a matter of fact, I 
don't know to this day whether Ralph ever knew who

12:37.474 --> 12:44.101
had done it. Now, how did you? Like when you're 
walking over there in the middle of the night, what

12:45.582 --> 12:49.388
did you wear? How did you carry the Babel bag?

12:56.097 --> 12:57.019
I really don't remember. I suspect we were in gym 
gear, probably black if we had it, just so we

12:57.039 --> 13:08.435
wouldn't be all that noticeable. And one of our... 
Oh, I know we had like a six pack of beer, and two or

13:11.198 --> 13:26.676
three of the holes in the six pack were already 
empty, and although Earl and neither of us really

13:11.198 --> 13:26.676
drank, Earl would have a beer occasionally. I was a 
Southern Baptist teetotaler, but we had that. The

13:33.399 --> 13:42.588
Babbo was down in there until we got right over 
outside the room and we lit the cigarette and put it

13:33.399 --> 13:42.588
on the fuse. If we got encountered or caught or 
anything, we were going to put it down. We were

13:50.295 --> 13:50.956
drunk. We'd been out too late and we were just 
staggering back in from the bar. and on our way back

13:55.867 --> 14:05.179
to the dorm so that was going to be our cover story if 
we got caught either on our way over or on the way

13:55.867 --> 14:05.179
back but nobody ever saw us. Describe the routine 
in your outfit for a fish in the dining room.

14:16.234 --> 14:24.405
We always went over and marched over in formation 
until you got just right in front of the door and

14:16.234 --> 14:24.405
then they'd say break and then the fish would stand 
fast until all the upperclassmen filed in and then

14:24.892 --> 14:35.646
the fish would file in and you ate family style. 
Everybody went in at once and you got to your tables

14:35.666 --> 14:54.730
and they were eight person tables, four people to a 
side and the end of the table that was on the main,

14:35.666 --> 14:54.730
either one of the main aisles or one of the feeder 
pathway aisles, the two fish sat on the end of the

14:56.718 --> 15:22.354
table that was called the hot corner because 
that's where the waiter brought all the food and

14:56.718 --> 15:22.354
then the fish then would distribute the bowls and 
platters of food and then of course the seniors

14:56.718 --> 15:22.354
always took theirs first and then it went to the 
juniors and then to the sophomores and then to the

14:56.718 --> 15:22.354
fish and

15:23.768 --> 15:43.178
course the fish had to sit at attention to keep the 
back straight we didn't eat square meals but we did

15:23.768 --> 15:43.178
you know you had to answer all of any questions that 
they ask and you had to respond any kind of services

15:23.768 --> 15:43.178
or favors you had to respond and and and then if you 
if there's any time left then you got a little

15:43.462 --> 16:11.022
chance to eat and then they had cush questions and 
cush was dessert and uh... what were some of your

15:43.462 --> 16:11.022
favorite cush questions that you remember i 
really don't remember any usually it had to do with

15:43.462 --> 16:11.022
campusology uh... like uh... you know who stormed 
the beaches at normandy or were the cush questions

15:43.462 --> 16:11.022
in your outfit factual yes sometimes it had to do 
with current events Sometimes it had to do with

16:11.170 --> 16:14.533
campusology, stuff that you're supposed to know 
anyway. So if you knew the answer. If you knew the

16:15.914 --> 16:18.176
answer, then you qualified for your dessert. And 
if you didn't, sometimes they'd give you a second

16:18.477 --> 16:25.903
or third chance either to embarrass yourself or to 
qualify for desserts. Occasionally, I don't

16:26.123 --> 16:35.892
specifically remember ever not qualifying for 
dessert, but I remember some of my fish buddies did

16:26.123 --> 16:35.892
occasionally. Did they attempt to teach you all 
the chow hall slang, or did you just pick it up? No,

16:41.157 --> 16:42.620
it was mandatory. You had to learn it. That was part 
of the campusology. Did you ever, when you got

16:47.291 --> 16:53.063
home, forget?

16:53.144 --> 17:00.600
Not any of the inappropriate words for mixed 
company, but I did. deal for bread and sky for water

17:00.918 --> 17:07.083
and all the other different things. Occasionally 
I'd use one of those. I remember one time I did it at

17:08.965 --> 17:16.632
home and I did it premeditated. It wasn't 
unintentional just to see the reaction on my dad's

17:16.692 --> 17:20.875
face. He just kind of looked up and kind of grinned. 
Mom said, what's that? What's that mean? I said, I

17:28.502 --> 17:29.963
don't know. I forget dad what does that mean he told 
her. Did you all do any pranks in the dining room?

17:39.074 --> 17:55.073
Occasionally but I don't remember well I do 
remember one deal fight that's where you take the

17:39.074 --> 17:55.073
rolls or bread and wad it up and then throw it at 
other units and usually there'd be maybe a

17:55.357 --> 18:23.423
vendetta between two units or maybe the unit that 
had just won the General Moore trophy or had won the

17:55.357 --> 18:23.423
graded March pass the week before if they were real 
arrogant and cocky and smug and overbearing about

17:55.357 --> 18:23.423
having won and about being the best and being 
number one. Sometimes it would be everybody

18:23.673 --> 18:31.123
against them, and everybody would just throw 
everything in their direction. But y'all didn't

18:31.643 --> 18:37.831
play any pranks on the upperclassmen with their 
food?

18:37.851 --> 18:38.632
Not that I recall. We may have, and I might react if I 
heard some incidents, but I don't recall any off

18:38.712 --> 18:45.561
the top of my head. What was your favorite and least 
favorite Aggie foods?

18:52.613 --> 18:53.674
I kind of liked it all. I was not a gourmet or fussy 
eater. I eat to live. I don't live to eat. So I always

19:02.382 --> 19:09.249
found it good, and I always thought when people 
complained about the food, they just needed

19:02.382 --> 19:09.249
something to complain about. Was there plenty of 
it? Yes.

19:14.914 --> 19:20.359
What was special about your outfit, friendships, 
and what did it take pride in?

19:23.647 --> 19:37.219
I

19:23.647 --> 19:37.219
don't know, that doesn't really trigger 
anything. We

19:37.259 --> 19:44.586
always were good but rarely ever number one. We 
were always somewhere in the top four or five or

19:45.707 --> 19:52.253
six.

19:54.089 --> 20:23.809
but we never could maybe occasionally we'd get a 
number two but maybe on a particular weekend march

19:54.089 --> 20:23.809
or something or a particular graded march by it 
seemed like every Thursday evening they'd have a

19:54.089 --> 20:23.809
graded march by where you'd form up you'd go down 
the quadrangle and then march in and there was a

19:54.089 --> 20:23.809
reviewing stand and graders

20:26.287 --> 20:28.750
before you got to the Duncan Dining Hall. We may 
have occasionally won one of those, but we never

20:29.171 --> 20:35.679
won a General Moore or any of the big trophies. So 
mostly we concentrated on individual

20:35.719 --> 20:48.495
events and activities, and I spent most of my spare 
time over at the MSC. I got involved in Memorial

20:48.555 --> 20:51.779
Student Center activities. How did that begin? Do 
you remember? Well, it began with the freshman

20:55.666 --> 21:07.125
orientation, the reception for the college 
president over at TMSC. And as I recall, was

21:07.947 --> 21:14.197
Williams the one that immediately preceded 
Rutter? David Morgan. Morgan, okay, David

21:17.563 --> 21:20.728
Morgan, okay. I believe he was president there and 
this was probably in September or October it was

21:22.295 --> 21:39.190
early in the school year probably was in September 
where they had the MSC host the fish reception

21:39.406 --> 21:41.008
President and Mrs. Morgan. So I went over there and 
following the reception all the different MSC

21:43.531 --> 21:53.782
committees had sign up places and display booths 
about what they did. That's where I learned about

21:53.842 --> 22:09.379
Town Hall and SCONA and great issues and the music 
committee and the camera committee and all the

21:53.842 --> 22:09.379
different things that you could do as a form of 
extracurricular activities and leadership and

22:10.118 --> 22:36.042
the great issues committee attracted my 
attention and so I went to the MSC pretty often for

22:10.118 --> 22:36.042
one thing it it you escaped a lot of the harassment 
over in the around the quadrangle and even though I

22:10.118 --> 22:36.042
had been a competitive athlete in in high school I 
knew I was too small and really wasn't all that

22:36.241 --> 22:43.050
good. I had lettered twice in football and three 
times in baseball and twice in basketball and once

22:43.110 --> 22:58.890
in golf, but I just didn't feel like I was going to be 
competitive enough to try that at collegiate

22:59.073 --> 23:22.279
level so and I did participate some with our outfit 
and intramural activities but I spent most of my

22:59.073 --> 23:22.279
time at the MSC just because I was more attracted to 
that and

22:59.073 --> 23:22.279
so I ended up being on the great issues committee 
How soon before you met Wayne Stark? Did you know

23:27.691 --> 23:28.632
who he was? Yes, I met him pretty early. In fact, the 
very first meeting that I went to the Great Issues

23:30.954 --> 23:39.803
Committee, he was an advisor to the Great Issues 
Committee. Of course, he was like an ex-officio

23:40.464 --> 23:50.815
advisor to all of the committees and could sit in on 
any of the meetings anytime he wanted, but he

23:40.464 --> 23:50.815
delegated some of that. the really important ones 
where you're bringing international and

23:51.065 --> 24:11.132
nationally known visitors in like the SCONA and 
great issues and town hall he was almost always

23:51.065 --> 24:11.132
present for those committee meetings along with 
one or two other faculty or former student

23:51.065 --> 24:11.132
advisors and I do remember being told several 
times at that first committee meeting to relax and

24:11.956 --> 24:39.516
participate because I was still a little nervous 
and tense and whenever there are upperclassmen

24:11.956 --> 24:39.516
around you naturally defer and are a little bit 
reticent to get in and yet in that setting that's

24:11.956 --> 24:39.516
different from the regimentation of the cadet 
corps even though they're cadets also. But I

24:40.357 --> 24:46.603
remember being encouraged several times to relax 
and join in and speak up and so I did, made several

24:47.174 --> 25:16.877
suggestions and then they needed somebody to 
write the invitations to the candidates that we

24:47.174 --> 25:16.877
had brainstormed, folks who wanted to come to the 
campus and so I don't remember if I volunteered or

24:47.174 --> 25:16.877
if they asked me to do it and in fact it probably was a 
two or three person subcommittee to do that but I

24:47.174 --> 25:16.877
ended up drafting the letters and sending the 
letters out to attract the speakers and

25:17.465 --> 25:24.939
was pretty successful at that. I

25:27.644 --> 25:34.095
can't remember if it was my freshman year or my 
sophomore year. It must have been my sophomore

25:34.135 --> 25:35.598
year. We had gotten to a place where were coming up 
on the Christmas holidays and we still had one key

25:41.765 --> 25:48.835
speaker due in the spring that we had not filled. We 
had asked Dr. Paul Seifel who was a physicist who

25:50.518 --> 26:09.426
did earth crust studies and had been North Pole, 
South Pole and I guess studied the tectonic plate

25:50.518 --> 26:09.426
movements and so forth. and we wanted him to be one 
of the speakers, but we hadn't heard anything from

26:09.592 --> 26:16.703
him, either yes or no. And so that was one of the 
occasions for a visit to the green couch. I think my

26:23.794 --> 26:35.211
sophomore year I was vice chairman of the great 
issues, and I supervised the scheduling and the

26:23.794 --> 26:35.211
inviting of the guests. And so Wayne had me over 
there, Mr. Stark. It was in very recent years that I

26:39.695 --> 26:47.426
felt like calling him Wayne because all those 
years, even for years after I graduated, he was

26:39.695 --> 26:47.426
always Mr. Stark. But anyway, he called me in and 
asked when we expected to hear. I said, well, I

26:54.335 --> 26:57.700
think we've done all we can. And he concurred. And 
so he picked up his phone. and he dialed and I could

27:03.457 --> 27:30.392
tell from the dial it was long distance and he just 
said hi so and so and called somebody by name he said

27:03.457 --> 27:30.392
is Tiger in and I was thinking who in the world is 
Tiger and the thought crossed my mind I know the

27:03.457 --> 27:30.392
congressman from this area is named Tiger Teague 
Olin Teague was nicknamed Tiger and

27:03.457 --> 27:30.392
I thought gee could it be him you know now and he's 
really going to high places I mean I was really

27:30.625 --> 27:56.481
impressed if he's going to try to get him to help us 
get a speaker confirmed and so he

27:30.625 --> 27:56.481
said we need some help he said I'm sitting here with 
one of the student leaders and we're and we need to

27:56.917 --> 28:26.502
ask you a favor and then he reached over and he 
punched the speaker phone and he introduced me to

27:56.917 --> 28:26.502
Tiger Teague over the speaker phone and then he 
said

27:56.917 --> 28:26.502
James or Cadet Ray or whatever he called me at the 
time he said he's got a favor he needs to ask of you

27:56.917 --> 28:26.502
and I thought moi and so I kind of stumbled through 
it and told him what we needed and he said well let me

27:56.917 --> 28:26.502
see if I can call him and encourage him to give y'all 
a positive answer and so sure enough before we left

28:26.650 --> 28:54.919
for Christmas break we had a letter from Dr. Seiple 
saying he'd be glad to come speak to the great issue

28:26.650 --> 28:54.919
series so the MSC was a broadening place but it was 
also an escape place wasn't it yes and my initial

28:26.650 --> 28:54.919
attraction was the escape Well, I'll say maybe 
60-40 escape and 40%. I really enjoyed it and

29:02.633 --> 29:06.919
wanted to be involved in that kind of thing. But 
then after three or four meetings, I mean it was

29:08.381 --> 29:24.703
60-40 the other way and then 70, 80, 90, 100% and the 
escape didn't mean that much to me anymore because

29:08.381 --> 29:24.703
as you went along, if you were pretty, if you were 
reasonably competent in your marching your

29:25.342 --> 29:35.605
formations and your room inspections and kept up 
with things with your outfit gradually the the

29:36.648 --> 30:03.820
harassment or the training the encouragement the 
motivation you know kind of died down and

29:36.648 --> 30:03.820
especially if your grades were good and you were 
involved in other activities a lot of times you

29:36.648 --> 30:03.820
could use that as an excuse you know if some 
sophomore wanted to stop you and have you whip out

29:36.648 --> 30:03.820
to ten of his buddies and harassing you could say 
legitimately excuse me sir I'm I'm going to be late

30:04.711 --> 30:29.790
to a class or I'm going to be late to a meeting over at 
the MSC and most of the time they would honor that

30:04.711 --> 30:29.790
and especially if they had no sense that you were 
abusing it and Fish occasionally might abuse that

30:04.711 --> 30:29.790
if they were trying to get out of trouble but most of 
the time it was legit and so that usually you could

30:04.711 --> 30:29.790
do whatever you needed to do and I got to where I 
enjoyed that and that was more my contribution to

30:30.158 --> 30:40.101
the campus and to the outfit because they also 
liked each outfit got some points I don't know for

30:41.650 --> 31:01.124
for student participation leadership 
participation in various activities and so that

30:41.650 --> 31:01.124
was encouraged occasionally might get a sourpuss 
sophomore or junior that was uh maybe getting a

30:41.650 --> 31:01.124
little bit jealous of your notoriety and and they 
might harass you a little bit about it but most of

30:41.650 --> 31:01.124
the time it was all positive. What did you learn 
from those MSC activities and particularly from

31:01.665 --> 31:05.532
Wayne Stark? for your future? Well, horizon 
broadening, the willingness to or being ready and

31:07.147 --> 31:24.077
confident that if you've got a chance to take part 
in a big enterprise to do it because that's a...
