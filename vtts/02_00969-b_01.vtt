00:01.718 --> 00:10.966
The interview with Chester Clark, and the 
question is, did he feel that the media took

00:01.718 --> 00:10.966
certain things about the Vietnam conflict out of 
context in reporting? I mentioned Lieutenant

00:12.608 --> 00:24.598
Calley, who, indeed, if you look at the things that 
he was accused of doing and then some of the things

00:12.608 --> 00:24.598
that he admitted doing, those are things that are 
appalling to us. The murders of people, whether

00:24.958 --> 00:30.223
innocent people or guilty people or whatever, The 
murders of mass people recalled to people's minds

00:30.406 --> 00:39.198
the things that happened in Germany with the Jews. 
And the Israel was compared to that sometimes. And

00:42.042 --> 00:50.454
I don't know what was in his mind, what he thought 
about, what he had been through, even if the

00:42.042 --> 00:50.454
actions he took were justified or not. I just know 
that they were played up so that he was looked upon

00:51.095 --> 00:58.405
as a madman and did all these murders because he had 
the power to. and his supervisors were were

00:58.705 --> 01:22.570
scrutinized for their part in it and not and he was 
he was uh when he said i was following direct orders

00:58.705 --> 01:22.570
since municipal and the whole military was looked 
at as you give a guy an order and he follows it

00:58.705 --> 01:22.570
without thinking about it so the military played 
up a lot of things that have happened for a long time

00:58.705 --> 01:22.570
and just applied them to vietnam All right, how did 
you feel about the anti-war demonstrators and the

01:24.693 --> 01:37.044
draft dodgers, the people who burned their draft 
cards or went to Canada, that sort of thing, the

01:24.693 --> 01:37.044
anti-war sentiment as a whole? As a professional 
military man, of course, I didn't like any of it.

01:42.149 --> 01:46.213
And I felt there would be better ways to show your 
objection to a war. And I would never understand

01:47.113 --> 01:54.480
someone going to Canada to avoid military 
service. there's the demonstrations that they

01:55.118 --> 02:02.807
had were very, I was, I was a part of those 
demonstrations, if you will. When I came back from

02:02.827 --> 02:12.019
Vietnam, my assignment was at the Pentagon and I 
drove to work along the Potomac on the west side of

02:02.827 --> 02:12.019
the Potomac. There were army tanks on the east side 
of the Potomac that were around the reflection

02:12.659 --> 02:21.991
pool and in front of the Lincoln Memorial where 
they were having a lot of demonstrations. So I saw

02:22.011 --> 02:24.754
the demonstrations firsthand and was affected by 
the demonstrations. In fact, one of the things

02:27.861 --> 02:45.903
that we had briefings on were the demonstrations 
that were going on in the States and why they were

02:27.861 --> 02:45.903
happening and

02:27.861 --> 02:45.903
how a certain amount of people felt. But then on the 
other hand, you'd receive letters and cards from

02:46.324 --> 02:52.952
home that were supporting what you were doing, 
supporting you. and from schools a lot of schools

02:53.388 --> 03:18.535
have their the whole grade write a letter to dear gi 
or dear mr joe and those things were very

02:53.388 --> 03:18.535
refreshing to get because people were telling 
their kids that the military was doing a job uh did

02:53.388 --> 03:18.535
you know any veterans who came back after vietnam 
and demonstrated against the war or any officers

02:53.388 --> 03:18.535
who became members of Veterans for Peace or 
Vietnam Veterans Against the War, any of those

03:18.835 --> 03:24.261
groups? None at all. I was, and probably the 
geography of where I was played a part in it. I was

03:31.128 --> 03:34.632
stationed at the Pentagon and then stationed at 
military bases. And no one that I was aware of was a

03:35.252 --> 03:44.202
member of any group that opposed Vietnam or had any 
or join any group that demonstrate actively

03:44.840 --> 03:48.866
against what we've done.

03:51.650 --> 03:57.177
So you didn't feel like there was an undercurrent 
within the military against Vietnam at all? I

03:57.538 --> 03:57.838
didn't. I really didn't. The people I was with, we 
had a job to do. We realized the importance of the

04:03.987 --> 04:13.260
job and just carried out those tasks that we had to 
do. And my task was to support the ground troops

04:13.595 --> 04:19.000
that were in Vietnam. Their task was to keep out 
this spread of communism. And the way they were

04:25.206 --> 04:29.790
doing it was with their way of fighting the war. And 
sometimes that was by just simply keeping

04:30.491 --> 04:43.483
infiltrators from coming down from the north, by 
destroying supply lines that were supplying the

04:30.491 --> 04:43.483
North Vietnamese and the South. or by trying to 
even to help the South Vietnamese to gain their

04:43.987 --> 04:49.153
self-respect and be self-reliant. So that was 
also part of the plan to make Vietnam, South

04:49.774 --> 05:01.567
Vietnam, be self-reliant when we did pull out. The 
plan you are referring to is Vietnamization, I

05:01.587 --> 05:07.053
believe. Do you feel, and it has been highly talked 
about after the Vietnam War, Do you feel like if

05:11.543 --> 05:15.229
that plan had been implemented the right way that 
it would have worked? Implement the right way,

05:17.673 --> 05:25.885
it's very difficult to say because had it been 
implemented the right way, there would have been a

05:17.673 --> 05:25.885
status quo in Vietnam. We would not have had the 
North Vietnamese pulling one way and us pulling

05:25.905 --> 05:30.052
another. For them to be self-reliant would have 
meant they wouldn't have anybody trying to

05:30.633 --> 05:39.306
overtake them because they were not strong enough 
to stand on their own ever. We touched on this a

05:40.788 --> 05:42.951
little while ago. How did or do you feel about Jane 
Fonda and her denouncement of the United States?

05:51.121 --> 06:08.302
That was really hard to take because Jane Fonda and 
her family, of course, being movie folks, I've

05:51.121 --> 06:08.302
enjoyed them in movies quite a bit, and Jane Fonda 
made some statements that even if they'd been

05:51.121 --> 06:08.302
true, it would have hurt very much to hear somebody 
say them. And no one likes to hear that they've that

06:10.859 --> 06:14.744
they bombed a hospital or a children's home or 
something like that. And the reason that we were

06:15.425 --> 06:31.125
privileged to the information about the 
individuals I spoke of that did bomb the SAM site in

06:15.425 --> 06:31.125
Hanoi was that the minute Jane Fonda said that, 
there was doubts in almost everyone's minds that

06:15.425 --> 06:31.125
we had done the right thing. And doubt creeps in 
that you have, if you've really killed children,

06:31.425 --> 06:37.693
and most of us had children, That really plays on 
your mind. So they immediately made available to

06:39.750 --> 06:49.880
us the pictures of the SAM site, the geography 
around it, and we were assured that there was no...

06:49.920 --> 06:51.922
There were, of course, civilian casualties. Any 
time you bombed something, there's going to be

06:51.942 --> 06:56.507
civilian casualties or casualties of people 
around. But there was nothing like hospitals or

06:56.968 --> 07:00.311
children's homes. And it was just not something 
that she should have said And, of course, it didn't

07:06.327 --> 07:08.430
matter if it was Jane Fonda. It could have been 
anybody saying it, and that had the same effect.

07:10.453 --> 07:16.523
But Jane Fonda was one that you expect her to be 
backing you. You expect all the young Jane Fondas

07:16.563 --> 07:26.899
and the movie stars to have the appeal to people to 
back you, that people are looking up to. And it was

07:27.540 --> 07:32.267
disappointing that someone of her stature would 
say something that was that derogatory. I have

07:32.669 --> 07:47.064
known some Vietnam veterans and some military 
families that will not go to any Jane Fonda movies

07:32.669 --> 07:47.064
or will not rent any of her videotapes for aerobics 
or any of those things. Do you have that strong a

07:47.084 --> 07:53.270
feeling against Jane Fonda or was it just simply at 
that time what she said? It was just what she said

07:53.310 --> 07:55.733
and not her. I didn't like her actions, but as for 
her herself, I would probably like her. I have

08:01.098 --> 08:02.119
nothing She has apologized since then, recently, 
for some of the things that she said and did. And it

08:09.123 --> 08:26.463
would be very interesting to know if her versions, 
like the hospital and the children's home, if that

08:09.123 --> 08:26.463
was actually something that she said, that she was 
prompted to say, or if she really felt that she had

08:09.123 --> 08:26.463
been shown what had been hit and bombed. I have no 
idea. She has apologized for... What reason? I

08:30.956 --> 08:31.337
don't know. If she apologized because she's 
sincerely sorry for it, fine. If she's trying to

08:34.742 --> 08:40.150
sell her newest exercise tape or her newest movie, 
that'd be another story.

08:43.475 --> 08:47.802
Did you or do you know any POWs who came out of the 
conflict? Yes, I had one POW that was a POW for seven

08:48.844 --> 08:54.673
years. His name was Ron Burns, and Ron I met his 
family before I met him. I was stationed at the

09:01.207 --> 09:02.989
Pentagon when I came back. And at the Pentagon, I 
had occasion to meet several people who were

09:03.390 --> 09:21.629
working with the POWs and trying to secure the 
release of the POWs and to recover the bodies of the

09:03.390 --> 09:21.629
killed in action and the missing in action to find 
out what they were doing. And when I left the

09:22.490 --> 09:26.815
Pentagon, I went to Hanscom Air Force Base near 
Boston. And while there, I met a family, two boys

09:27.503 --> 09:39.073
and the mother, whose husband was a POW, and knew 
them very well. And while we were there, he was

09:39.294 --> 09:42.597
released and came back. And he never really talked 
about his experiences. He would always

09:48.662 --> 09:56.329
tell you things that would be helpful to the 
occasion. If in church he was asked to make a talk,

09:56.900 --> 10:11.454
he would tell you about how his faith helped him to 
get through, how his prayers were helped and how he

09:56.900 --> 10:11.454
felt that people praying for him helped. If he was 
talking to a scout group, he would tell them how his

10:11.674 --> 10:26.248
preparedness for being in Vietnam had helped him 
and how he would prepare for every day and how he

10:11.674 --> 10:26.248
would think about those lessons he had learned and 
disciplined and how all of his scout training

10:26.650 --> 10:28.773
helped him. He would apply his experiences to 
whatever he was talking about. He never showed a

10:31.758 --> 10:43.897
lot of any bitterness or any self-pity or any of 
those kinds of things that have come out from other

10:31.758 --> 10:43.897
individuals that were POWs. He had a very tragic 
homecoming as much as after he was released after

10:45.479 --> 10:54.413
seven years, after about four months in the 
States, his wife was found to have terminal cancer

10:54.983 --> 10:59.328
and did die later on. And he took his seven years of 
POW, his wife's death, he turned all those things

10:59.909 --> 11:08.079
into something positive. He made a good life for 
himself without retreating or feeling sorry for

11:08.099 --> 11:17.271
himself or expecting anybody to do anything for 
him over and above what they were doing for anybody

11:08.099 --> 11:17.271
else. So you do feel that a lot of coming home after 
Vietnam a lot of the problems that some of the

11:24.363 --> 11:38.336
veterans have had, if they had dealt with them head 
on, that they might have, as this may do, that they

11:24.363 --> 11:38.336
might have been able to come through without the 
traumatic experiences? Yes, I really do. And when

11:40.198 --> 11:43.541
I say that, you have to understand where I'm coming 
from. Colonel Burns, of course, was an officer. I

11:46.244 --> 11:46.965
was an officer. We had different standards we 
lived by because of the structure of the military

11:47.425 --> 11:52.530
itself. and we probably were not exposed to as many 
different uh situations as enlisted people were

12:00.593 --> 12:28.373
are people in different areas of vietnam but i 
think carl burns probably went through as many

12:00.593 --> 12:28.373
traumatic experiences with seven years as pow and 
with his losing his wife and the way he lost her as

12:00.593 --> 12:28.373
anyone and he still did not suffer any of the the 
horrible consequences that some of the people

12:00.593 --> 12:28.373
have had have reported to have recently um i've 
heard Earlier you mentioned special forces and

12:28.589 --> 12:34.537
some of the different groups of the service. How 
did you feel about the Green Berets and special

12:35.018 --> 12:40.666
forces and those type people? Did you have respect 
for those people or did you feel that they were not

12:41.107 --> 12:52.303
in the same league as the Air Force?

12:53.665 --> 12:57.330
I couldn't put a number on the amount of respect. 
that I had for those people and the amount of

12:57.833 --> 13:05.924
respect and gratitude that the American people 
owe those people for what they did in Vietnam. I

13:06.565 --> 13:08.007
worked with the Special Forces. I flew in and out of 
their camps all the time. I was assigned to them

13:10.830 --> 13:12.412
specifically. And in particular with the Army, I 
worked with 101st Airborne. And the Green Berets

13:16.938 --> 13:20.884
and Special Forces fought the war. The Air Force 
didn't. We supplied them, we supported them, but

13:22.846 --> 13:27.132
we didn't fight the war. Many times the Air Force 
was called upon to do such things as drop bombs from

13:27.500 --> 13:37.194
20,000 feet, which takes very little bravery on 
anyone's part. We flew into places that were very

13:37.855 --> 13:48.251
small landing strips, very difficult to get into, 
but that required being a good pilot. It didn't

13:48.271 --> 13:51.195
require any bravery at all or anything special. On 
one occasion, we took a mortuary team into a site. A

13:56.651 --> 14:01.083
123 had crashed into a mountain, and 13 people were 
on board. There was communications gear on board.

14:05.705 --> 14:08.308
You couldn't get to the site because it was on the 
side of a mountain. So we secured helicopters to go

14:09.069 --> 14:11.792
to the site. And we took a marchery team, a first 
lieutenant, army first lieutenant, and his team

14:12.192 --> 14:23.765
were lowered down from a helicopter onto the site 
itself. The site was not secure at all. It was in VC

14:27.289 --> 14:30.733
territory, and they owned the mountain it was on. 
When we let the crew down, we let down the

14:32.333 --> 14:55.123
lieutenant with his six people, and they were 
responsible for securing the site as best they

14:32.333 --> 14:55.123
could, and in the wreckage itself, find those 13 
bodies, put them in body bags, and prepare them for

14:32.333 --> 14:55.123
bringing them out of there to take them back to 
Thompson Nook, to the mortuary. One of the

14:57.045 --> 14:58.527
political...

15:00.869 --> 15:03.252
hang-ups that we had was not a hang-up. The 
engineer on the crew was from Thailand. It was

15:06.957 --> 15:13.986
absolutely necessary that we return that 
individual's body to the Thai government. And the

15:14.006 --> 15:20.535
wreckage itself is very difficult to find 
anybody's, much less a specific one. But that

15:21.176 --> 15:26.743
lieutenant with his crew went down, and this was 
part of their everyday mission. When they got on

15:27.664 --> 15:29.627
the ground, the fog came in. and we had we could not 
get them out at one time we had to go back to the to our

15:30.282 --> 15:53.691
base and wait for the fog to lift go back in and pick 
them up the lieutenant and his bunch stayed

15:30.282 --> 15:53.691
overnight and they've been prepared to go down and 
come right back up but they stayed overnight they

15:30.282 --> 15:53.691
got the bodies they secured the area they found 
that they had to To sleep, they had to tie

15:54.059 --> 15:57.885
themselves to a tree because it was that steep on 
the mountainside. They destroyed some of the

15:58.886 --> 16:04.876
classified communications gear that was in the 
C-123 when it crashed. We went back the next

16:05.817 --> 16:07.520
morning to pick them up. I consider what they had 
done very heroic, very deserving of some kind of

16:09.022 --> 16:13.288
recognition in the medal. But their attitude was 
they'd just simply done their job, and they

16:14.530 --> 16:22.783
expected nothing for it but just to go back to their 
base and start again. And when we radioed down to

16:23.422 --> 16:30.289
the lieutenant, we said, you know, you spent the 
night, no food, no shelter, no clothing. He says,

16:30.309 --> 16:31.830
anything that you really want. And he came back 
over the radio and he says, yes, sir. He says, I sure

16:36.014 --> 16:37.896
would like a chocolate bar. And that was his 
concern that he was still kind of, you know,

16:38.696 --> 16:47.605
there's nothing like get us out of here, blah, 
blah, blah. But we did get them out. And the

16:49.527 --> 16:52.990
airplane was... The airplane was totally 
destroyed. They did destroy the gear that

16:55.696 --> 17:01.062
couldn't be left on the ground. They did find the 
tie with the symbolic Buddha that they wear. We did

17:07.449 --> 17:15.158
avoid what could have turned out to be an 
international incident by returning the correct

17:07.449 --> 17:15.158
body to Thailand. And these guys were just doing 
their job. They expected nothing from it. as

17:21.573 --> 17:27.861
opposed to other people who expected medals or 
write-ups for everything they did. Do you feel

17:29.043 --> 17:37.714
that Vietnam, that there were medals handed out 
that were undeserved in Vietnam more so than any

17:29.043 --> 17:37.714
other wars? Well, there were some handed out that 
were not deserved, and the reason they were is

17:39.116 --> 17:46.846
because of the position individuals were in. When 
I was in Saigon as a safety officer, one ticker

17:52.252 --> 17:58.240
individual, was in a position to write up the 
things for a medal. And he himself came out very

17:59.021 --> 18:03.788
decorated, even though he didn't, he never got out 
of Saigon. And he wasn't a regular flyer. He flew

18:07.332 --> 18:11.859
when he had to, to go somewhere and investigate an 
accident. But he had a lot of medals. Some of the

18:15.824 --> 18:21.752
medals were a little, I'll have some stories 
behind them that that are interesting. We had, in a

18:23.171 --> 18:30.232
C-123, there are cables that run back to the back 
that control the elevator and the rudder. And

18:30.794 --> 18:34.746
these cables sometimes fray and have little 
spikes that stick out on them. When we would take

18:36.093 --> 18:42.822
hits, we were usually getting hit in the back of the 
airplane, and the things the guns they were

18:36.093 --> 18:42.822
shooting with were not strong enough to go through 
the plane. They would go through the bottom skin of

18:43.343 --> 18:49.030
the plane, hit the top of the plane, and stay inside 
the plane. You'd hear them rattling around. And

18:50.873 --> 18:57.682
one particular time, we had taken several hits in 
the back of the plane, and we knew that the slugs

18:50.873 --> 18:57.682
were in the plane. And so my, one of the, no. It 
wasn't my crew, but it was a crew. And the

19:04.005 --> 19:06.828
loadmaster went back to the back to find the slug. 
And he took out the bulkhead part that allows you to

19:07.449 --> 19:16.939
go to the tail of the airplane and reached down to 
the bottom of the plane to pick up these slugs that

19:07.449 --> 19:16.939
were back there. When he did, he rubbed his hand 
across the cable and cut himself. And a cut in

19:22.505 --> 19:24.968
Vietnam is not like a cut anywhere else. Nothing 
gets well by itself. You must doctor it. If you

19:28.291 --> 19:29.893
leave it alone, it would be infected just quickly. 
So he went to the doctor. As they landed, this thing

19:34.433 --> 19:36.855
did bother him. So he went into the hospital. And 
they were cleaning it out and working on it. And

19:41.219 --> 19:42.680
someone said, how did you get this? And he said, 
well, I was taking a shell out of the back of the

19:42.820 --> 19:45.062
plane. And they wrote this up on their hospital 
notes. And later on, someone read it and says, oh,

19:49.887 --> 19:54.431
well, here's the guy that was wounded by a shell in a 
plane. He deserves a Purple Heart. And it turns out

19:57.073 --> 20:00.336
that this was someone put him in for the Purple 
Heart. And he had already left Vietnam. He was back

20:03.599 --> 20:04.580
in the States. So the paperwork came back down to 
me, a safety officer, to find this guy's unit to

20:05.081 --> 20:14.513
confirm he deserved a Purple Heart and to present 
him with this Purple Heart. And when the guy was

20:15.314 --> 20:23.624
contacted, of course, the true story came out that 
he had been scratched with the cable and not been

20:15.314 --> 20:23.624
shot. But that was just one of those things that 
someone had written up because more than not,

20:30.708 --> 20:36.716
Individuals who deserved awards weren't looking 
for them, like the mortuary team. They were not

20:36.836 --> 20:38.998
looking for awards. And when I flew people around, 
one particular flight in the C-123, there were no

20:39.018 --> 20:47.269
seats. We set the people on pallets, eight or 10 
across, and put a big strap over them. And your

20:52.375 --> 20:58.723
briefing to them was, if we crash, just bend 
forward and hope for the best, because there's no

20:52.375 --> 20:58.723
safety constraint. And you would look to the back 
before you'd take off, and I remember one

20:58.872 --> 21:17.529
particular flight, I looked around to the back, 
and there was a kid sitting there with his M-16 on

20:58.872 --> 21:17.529
one shoulder, reading a comic book, and out of his 
pocket was sticking a purple heart that he had

20:58.872 --> 21:17.529
received, and just sticking out of his pocket. 
Well, most people would have them waving them and

21:18.029 --> 21:20.752
say, look what I've got. He took it just for granted 
that he had this thing there. And there he was,

21:23.775 --> 21:27.478
reading a comic book, being flown right back into a 
combat zone. What are the Vietnam movies that

21:29.028 --> 21:40.342
you've seen, and which one do you consider to be 
closest to the real Vietnam experience, or what

21:29.028 --> 21:40.342
you were involved in? Well, unfortunately I 
haven't seen that many movies, but of course I've

21:41.223 --> 21:55.239
seen The Green Berets, and it did have some very 
authentic parts to it, but it had a lot of Hollywood

21:41.223 --> 21:55.239
commercialism in it also that were not true. I did 
see The Good Morning Vietnam. And aside from being

21:57.968 --> 22:16.382
very funny, that did have a few scenes in it where it 
was very true that an individual like the one that

21:57.968 --> 22:16.382
was the North Vietnamese that got him out of the 
cafe before it was bombed, those things did

21:57.968 --> 22:16.382
happen. people were aware that things were going 
to happen before they happened. And when I first

22:21.412 --> 22:27.720
arrived at Saigon, we were one day at the base. 
Someone said, I wouldn't hang around the base too

22:27.760 --> 22:31.144
long today. I'd go on home right after, you know, 
right after when you finish going home. I said,

22:35.989 --> 22:36.510
why? He says, well, look. And you could see that no 
Vietnamese were hanging around the base. They

22:42.096 --> 22:43.618
were all leaving early. And at that time, There was 
a search of the Vietnamese as they walked out the

22:45.910 --> 22:48.554
gate. And the two main things they were searching 
for were silverware and the soap, the washing

22:49.275 --> 22:54.344
powders. They would steal that frequently. But 
they would have a little tub there that would take

22:57.629 --> 23:02.116
the silverware off of them, spoons and knives and 
forks. But when they all left, quickly, they knew

23:02.737 --> 23:07.125
something was going to happen. And sure enough, 
that night, the base was mortared because they

23:09.147 --> 23:12.471
were all just filing out leaving. So they were 
aware of what was happening. I know you mentioned

23:20.280 --> 23:26.167
earlier that you have seen the USO and that you did 
move some of the equipment. It was highly

23:26.187 --> 23:27.408
classified. Do you believe that the USO helped to 
bring the morale of the troops up? Or do you believe

23:33.715 --> 23:36.218
it was beneficial to the troops? Oh, I really 
believe it helped. Very beneficial. And the most

23:40.399 --> 23:52.792
memorable occasion I had was at the USO show with 
Bob Hope and Barbara McNair sang Silent Night. And

23:53.873 --> 23:58.277
there were approximately 4,500 people in the 
audience that night. That was the quietest that

23:59.479 --> 24:02.762
you could ever hear a hillside. And that brought 
home to people more than anything else. This was a

24:07.228 --> 24:15.179
show that had the Miss America, Raquel Welch, and 
all the trimmings. But the thing I remember the

24:15.219 --> 24:17.161
most is Barbara McNair. You just echo through 
that. And that just brought Christmas home just

24:21.267 --> 24:25.633
like it was right there. Then the other show that 
was there that was just super was Martha Rae. She

24:31.058 --> 24:38.686
performed Hello Dolly, which brought you back to

24:31.058 --> 24:38.686
the States quite a bit. But then she came out, 
decked out in Green Beret outfit, the whole thing,

24:38.966 --> 24:44.511
and just talked. And you could identify. 
Everybody identified with what she was saying.

24:49.877 --> 24:51.418
Everybody identified with her. And she made a very 
strong point of telling you, how much she

24:56.320 --> 25:05.713
supported you, what she was for, that she 
represented the majority of the people in the

24:56.320 --> 25:05.713
United States, that you were not over here in vain, 
that you hadn't been forgotten. And you went away

25:06.273 --> 25:11.360
with such a good feeling that her show was just 
fantastic. Did it help to relieve some of the media

25:11.380 --> 25:18.750
problems that had been... reported about vietnam 
did that help to to make you realize that the

25:19.743 --> 25:49.193
majority was behind you at that point yes and it was 
very it was much easier to believe her than you know

25:19.743 --> 25:49.193
it was just really to believe what she was saying it 
helped to reiterate why you were there yeah yeah

25:19.743 --> 25:49.193
she when she said you're doing a good job we believe 
in you you know that that meant everything in the

25:19.743 --> 25:49.193
world to us have you kept in contact with your unit 
or with your crew members since you've left

25:19.743 --> 25:49.193
vietnam I haven't. And after I came back from 
Vietnam, I was at the Pentagon. And I did go to a

25:54.727 --> 26:02.798
Friday classified briefing every Friday to 
maintain contact with the unit and see what they

25:54.727 --> 26:02.798
were doing. But as time went along, I got very busy 
with what I was doing, very involved with my

26:03.459 --> 26:17.678
current job, and got completely away from what was 
happening in Vietnam and simply followed it

26:03.459 --> 26:17.678
through the news media like every other person in 
the United States. Did you have trouble

26:18.586 --> 26:27.677
readjusting when you came back to the weather or to 
your family, to not being in a war situation?

26:30.360 --> 26:32.823
I would like to say no, I had no trouble at all. I 
probably did and don't realize what it was. One of

26:37.008 --> 26:40.392
the, when I got off the plane, well actually, The 
first time I got back, weather was a problem. I was

26:42.293 --> 26:46.278
in a very thin raincoat, and we landed in Seattle, 
Washington. And Lord, I don't know how cold it was,

26:46.799 --> 26:49.622
but that raincoat wasn't enough. But when I got off 
the plane to Dallas and came out, I was one of the

26:50.303 --> 26:56.310
last ones out of the plane. And when I walked out, 
there was this little three-year-old kid that

26:56.330 --> 27:01.757
kept saying, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, everybody in 
uniform. And it was Tom, and he didn't know. He just

27:06.442 --> 27:08.725
knew Daddy was in uniform and was coming out. And 
probably I had trouble adjusting to them as they

27:09.076 --> 27:12.741
did to me. But it's like anything else. I remember 
only the good and not the bad. Very true. Very true.

27:22.513 --> 27:23.734
What are you doing now? And do you feel that your 
experience in Vietnam has helped you in the rest of

27:24.836 --> 27:34.328
your life and in coping with things? My current job 
now is I teach high school. I actually work in high

27:37.632 --> 27:38.593
school. And my military career overall has helped 
me in being a teacher, as much as in Vietnam as well

27:39.232 --> 27:49.585
as in my job in the Air Force. I was always an 
instructor pilot or an instructor for ground

27:50.246 --> 27:54.792
school, far flying. And in that capacity, I 
learned the teaching techniques. I worked with

27:58.897 --> 27:59.738
people. And I've just taken those skills and, of 
course, using my math background, I now teach math

28:00.379 --> 28:09.070
in high school. And the only thing I find that is 
lacking is I can't order the kids around like I

28:09.590 --> 28:17.942
could the people under me in the Air Force. Not 
quite as captive. No. But I have used all of my

28:20.024 --> 28:35.686
experience in coping with different situations, 
especially different situations in Vietnam, to

28:20.024 --> 28:35.686
cope with situations in the States which do not 
ever approach the severity of the situation I was

28:20.024 --> 28:35.686
in. My final question is, Do you feel that serving 
in Vietnam changed you, and if so, how?

28:47.377 --> 28:58.056
I really don't think it changed me in any way that I 
wouldn't have changed ordinarily, except it did

28:47.377 --> 28:58.056
it faster. In other words, if you're going to grow 
up, some people grow up at a certain rate of speed. I

29:05.003 --> 29:06.685
was going at that certain rate of speed. I was doing 
things that you do. I came out of high school and

29:09.449 --> 29:12.172
went to college. I came out of college and went in 
the military. I stayed in the military and things

29:15.036 --> 29:20.102
were just happening for me as they should happen. I 
got married, I had children. I went to Vietnam and

29:24.700 --> 29:29.167
probably matured four for one. I probably came 
back more mature, more aware of people's

29:29.327 --> 29:39.343
problems, more aware that there were more 
problems in the world than taking the trash out to

29:29.327 --> 29:39.343
the curb on a Friday morning. That helped me to grow 
up faster. be more tolerant of other people's

29:42.925 --> 29:52.604
problems and to learn to live with situations that 
are out of the ordinary. Learn to go from a very

29:52.624 --> 30:03.786
comfortable home in the States to a situation in 
Vietnam where suddenly there was, the first time I

29:52.624 --> 30:03.786
saw my uniforms washed on a rock, with a rock 
hitting him on the floor. That, I thought, you

30:07.159 --> 30:12.718
think about how far away that is from a, from a 
washing machine back home. And at the time, It was

30:16.422 --> 30:28.337
very easy to compare, and when I got back from 
Vietnam, it was very easy to look at the things that

30:16.422 --> 30:28.337
we had that we take for granted every day and 
realize how lucky we are and how much we have. And to

30:28.978 --> 30:37.148
also realize that this idealism that we had, that 
we could keep communism out of Vietnam, was really

30:37.837 --> 30:42.064
worthwhile, that we really were fighting for 
something worthwhile. And the way that Saigon is

30:42.865 --> 30:55.024
now Ho Chi Minh City, that the South Vietnamese are 
now under communist rule, tells me that we were

30:42.865 --> 30:55.024
doing the right thing. We were doing it for the 
right cause. I just wish that we could have

30:57.067 --> 31:00.212
accomplished what we set out to do. Thank you very 
much. I appreciate your time.
