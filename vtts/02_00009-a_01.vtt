WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:05.250
And we're at Colavista.

00:06.231 --> 00:20.850
And I have the pleasure of chatting with Les Appelt to try to record his memory of some of the key events that he recalls in recent A&M history.

00:24.916 --> 00:31.765
Les, you graduated and went back to, after the war, you were back in Houston.

00:31.785 --> 00:31.945
Right.

00:33.055 --> 00:40.290
When did you become active in A&M affairs after the war?

00:40.952 --> 00:43.578
A&M events, A&M activities?

00:46.223 --> 00:48.027
I was a member of the

00:48.462 --> 01:02.294
Associated Department of Students and really was so involved in what I was doing personally, probably the first 10 years after I got back from the service that other than contributed to the association and all.

01:02.714 --> 01:05.076
I didn't get deeply involved.

01:06.458 --> 01:17.187
I did get peripherally involved in the discussions and all that led up to A&M and co-ed.

01:17.572 --> 01:25.664
As most everyone will recall, it wasn't exactly an A&M decision.

01:25.684 --> 01:32.934
It was a decision by the courts in Texas that said that women had the right to go to A&M.

01:32.954 --> 01:43.630
And I think that General Rudolf was obviously impressed by those court decisions.

01:44.217 --> 01:56.970
I think that he sincerely felt it would be best for A&M to move into a co-ed situation so that he could have an opportunity to move forward and become one of the great universities.

01:57.571 --> 02:02.636
Did you and your close friends in Houston have any feelings about co-education?

02:04.899 --> 02:10.765
The Houston A&M Club had a meeting every Monday at the Rice Hotel.

02:11.470 --> 02:18.237
That was just a tremendously hot item of discussion back and forth and back and forth.

02:18.958 --> 02:36.516
And I recall one meeting that was particularly augmentative and I really became a little tired of listening to all of it and I stood up and said,

02:37.643 --> 02:43.632
Look guys, the court has ruled that A&M is going to be go ahead.

02:44.894 --> 02:46.696
It's going to happen.

02:46.716 --> 02:50.602
And to tell you the truth, I think it's going to be good for them.

02:50.622 --> 02:55.990
And Jimmy, I almost had to run from the door.

02:56.729 --> 03:19.765
I've been fortunate to have been elected to do a lot of things, be president of the Associates Department students, involved with the foundation and many other activities, but I was never elected to be president of Houston and M Club, and it's most likely because of that little speech.

03:21.047 --> 03:24.593
Later on, I was

03:25.147 --> 03:32.094
taken as a honorary president of Houston A&M Club.

03:32.114 --> 03:38.861
But that is after some of the old-timers that were that meeting in the 50s had already passed along.

03:39.642 --> 03:45.368
In general, was the Houston A&M Club membership, you think, opposed to co-education?

03:45.588 --> 03:55.018
At the time that we went there, the majority of the membership, particularly the old-timers that were really running into place,

03:55.218 --> 03:57.241
Very much opposed.

03:57.301 --> 04:02.407
They wanted to maintain the old military traditions, have everybody in the corps for that matter.

04:03.008 --> 04:11.098
And obviously, when you look at the numbers and what it needed to be, it couldn't happen.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.400
You couldn't have a corps that big.

04:12.780 --> 04:17.026
You couldn't have everything that they still wanted.

04:17.687 --> 04:23.554
It was really a matter that all of us have a problem with.

04:24.057 --> 04:29.845
We like, if something good had happened when we were involved, we want it to stay that way.

04:30.847 --> 04:37.436
And we are not willing to believe that the only constant is change.

04:38.999 --> 04:43.125
And we want to lock it in right there, just on those things.

04:43.225 --> 04:45.128
And that's what they were doing.

04:45.188 --> 04:53.760
They weren't trying to do anything but what their heart said was what they thought was the right thing to do.

04:54.753 --> 04:59.579
Looking back on it, what role do you see Earl Rudder playing in co-education?

05:00.039 --> 05:08.870
Well, you see, Earl was the right person at the right time to do that job.

05:11.433 --> 05:23.308
He had the personality, he had the respect, he had the charisma to do that job.

05:24.723 --> 05:29.911
particular qualifications said that he could carry this off.

05:30.772 --> 05:44.131
A person of lesser strength would not have been able to take that particular problem, say the bull by the horns, and move it and get it settled and done.

05:44.151 --> 05:46.234
It probably would have drifted along.

05:46.595 --> 05:54.426
It had happened, but it wouldn't have happened precisely and allowed him to go ahead and get it done and move ahead.

05:54.895 --> 06:02.945
Have you ever heard any explanation as to how the board of directors came to identify Mr. Rutter as the next president?

06:03.846 --> 06:06.729
How did they identify him instead of someone else?

06:07.931 --> 06:08.912
I'm not privy to that.

06:09.072 --> 06:10.734
I don't know that story either.

06:10.774 --> 06:13.197
That's one of the ones I want to look for.

06:14.078 --> 06:20.346
It's going to take someone older than myself, and you better hurry up and get them.

06:20.663 --> 06:24.887
because he had done such a fine job as land commissioner.

06:25.327 --> 06:26.308
Sterling Evans might.

06:26.629 --> 06:27.409
That's what I'm hoping.

06:27.670 --> 06:29.231
He might know that answer.

06:29.691 --> 06:33.155
All right, then non-compulsory core.

06:35.076 --> 06:43.805
Did the same people feel about opposition to making the core non-compulsory?

06:45.106 --> 06:49.590
Was it the same people that were opposed to co-education?

06:52.253 --> 07:01.567
But I didn't detect such a strong feeling in that area as it was on the co-eds.

07:02.508 --> 07:14.486
After the co-eds subject was settled, I didn't see any real problem with making the core non-compulsory.

07:14.506 --> 07:18.852
Alright now, when did you become active

07:19.237 --> 07:21.780
in the Association of Former Students.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.163
When did you begin to get there?

07:24.183 --> 07:25.144
In the mid-60s.

07:25.384 --> 07:33.433
I think that was the first time I held an office.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.418
The first portfolio I had was public relations.

07:37.438 --> 07:40.341
Who was the executive director then?

07:41.622 --> 07:42.203
Buck Wyrus.

07:43.124 --> 07:45.767
Describe Wyrus for someone that may never have known him.

07:46.793 --> 07:54.793
Well, Buck was a sort of irreplaceable type person.

07:56.457 --> 08:02.271
He turned out to be a good bridge between the old and the new.

08:03.415 --> 08:21.555
He related real well to the old guard and he also related well to the student body and the younger Aggies and served as a real good bridge to move us from a nickel and dime association.

08:22.155 --> 08:32.106
And really when I came on the board of the association,

08:33.487 --> 08:48.752
Mr. McQuillan had been the head of the executive of the association squad and he was just the finest gentleman you've ever seen.

08:50.635 --> 08:58.127
Very warm-hearted, really did all he could to get good

09:02.579 --> 09:14.290
get all he could to raise funds for student loans, one of which he gave me, and highly respected and loved.

09:16.593 --> 09:32.468
The thing that he couldn't quite wrap himself around was the fact that A&M people will respond to a higher level.

09:34.000 --> 09:42.653
He just didn't seem to want to go out and ask Aggies to give over $10 to $25 a year.

09:44.095 --> 09:52.828
And then we had a group on our board then.

09:52.888 --> 10:01.881
Jeff McGonnell was there and was one of the breeders in this.

10:04.156 --> 10:17.491
We had a really, really a pretty aggressive board and at the time we were printing the Texas Aggie on the versus the Xerox machine.

10:19.793 --> 10:31.446
And through that leadership group there, which I'm proud to be a part of, we voted a budget for the

10:32.118 --> 10:41.532
Texas Aggie, which is as fancy in the format it is now, just for that one item that was greater than the budget had ever been before.

10:42.313 --> 10:48.963
And out of that came the Century Club deal.

10:48.983 --> 10:53.189
We had to get the money and everybody thought it was a hundred dollars a year.

10:54.631 --> 10:56.715
But membership in Century Club, nobody will join.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.420
Well, that wasn't something.

11:02.425 --> 11:09.416
The membership just got rolling and rolling and rolling and we all know now what's happened.

11:09.436 --> 11:12.420
I don't know how many Century Club members we have, but there's a bunch.

11:12.741 --> 11:13.582
Tens of thousands.

11:13.602 --> 11:14.464
Tens of thousands.

11:14.484 --> 11:18.450
Do you know who, remember whose idea the Century Club was?

11:19.071 --> 11:21.475
Does anybody deserve credit for having thought it up?

11:22.957 --> 11:30.188
I'm not sure of that, but at that time, they said Jack Montgomery, Jim Sewell,

11:30.590 --> 11:58.504
on the board and others on the board and we all wanted to do things and get things going and it was about to be in that same period that the President Dowd Scholarship deal was conceived which required a $25,000 donation and again they said nobody will do it but

11:59.497 --> 12:01.219
there were five of us stepped up right away.

12:01.740 --> 12:09.491
Right now, if I'm not mistaken, there are five of you, none of whom was really first.

12:09.752 --> 12:11.554
It's five that were first, isn't it?

12:12.155 --> 12:15.099
Well, that's the way we conceived it.

12:15.119 --> 12:16.942
That's what I thought.

12:16.962 --> 12:18.784
Anybody that wants to claim me first is all right.

12:18.865 --> 12:20.547
Me, I don't care.

12:20.567 --> 12:22.510
But the five original solid style ships.

12:22.530 --> 12:27.597
You, Ford Albritton, Ross Weisenbaker, John Lindsay,

12:28.403 --> 12:29.785
Who's the fifth one?

12:30.426 --> 12:31.588
Maggie McGee.

12:31.609 --> 12:32.230
Maggie McGee.

12:32.951 --> 12:41.886
And it was sort of, for most of us sort of a step up in the act of faith.

12:42.167 --> 12:46.013
Let's see if we can get this to a new level.

12:46.033 --> 12:53.466
And after that, of course,

12:54.509 --> 13:08.904
largely due to Bob Latimer's insight into what needed to be done, the foundation was what you might call reactivated.

13:08.924 --> 13:11.547
Yes, now tell me as much as you can about that.

13:11.927 --> 13:15.711
How did it come to be reactivated?

13:15.731 --> 13:18.634
Well, the way it come to be reactivated was this.

13:19.435 --> 13:22.018
The foundation was established in the mid-50s.

13:23.045 --> 13:32.535
And it was largely the work of Herman Heap and a few of his contemporaries.

13:34.377 --> 13:39.382
And they established their board.

13:39.402 --> 13:51.735
And Herman Heap and primarily him, but a few associates out of Houston, made some contributions.

13:52.492 --> 14:03.384
They had, as I recall, never added to those original contributions.

14:03.404 --> 14:20.203
And the foundation original charter provided that the Association of Former Students would alternatively with the administration

14:20.707 --> 14:29.677
nominate people to the foundation board.

14:29.697 --> 14:41.490
And the budget provided that if either of those nominating people did not make the nomination, that the other one could go ahead and make the nomination.

14:42.011 --> 14:49.019
And from this forth, they would make all the nominations.

14:49.039 --> 14:50.140
Well, I suppose the primary

14:50.558 --> 15:10.616
Because of all of the problems that were involved in this co-ed and non-compulsory court deal, for one reason or another, the administration did not make a nomination.

15:11.577 --> 15:20.565
The association made it and put the foundation as almost the sole child of the association.

15:21.220 --> 15:26.785
The foundation was what?

15:26.805 --> 15:31.629
Legally, the foundation officially belonged to whom?

15:31.649 --> 15:44.801
It is a private foundation whose purpose was to, there was no other purpose other than to assist in Texas University.

15:44.821 --> 15:47.824
But it was a separate, entirely independent.

15:47.844 --> 15:48.885
Yes.

15:48.945 --> 15:50.907
Which I don't think can be done anymore.

15:51.038 --> 15:52.019
Probably not.

15:52.039 --> 15:53.781
I think the laws now have stopped.

15:54.301 --> 16:00.748
But at any rate, it is probably the most fortuitous thing that ever happened.

16:00.768 --> 16:05.913
So Mr. Heap deserves a lot of credit for its being created.

16:05.933 --> 16:07.014
Created.

16:07.275 --> 16:12.040
I don't think he had any idea of what his potential was.

16:12.640 --> 16:17.265
At least if they did, they wasted about

16:17.583 --> 16:23.229
twenty-something, about eighteen years or so, not doing anything.

16:24.371 --> 16:38.346
And I can still remember about that time, Pete Wayne, who was Arthur Anderson's chief in Houston, and I were really good friends, the classic party one with me and we'd have a life together.

16:38.366 --> 16:41.650
He told me one day, he said, Les, you know one of the hardest things to do

16:42.575 --> 16:46.340
is for somebody to give money to Texas A&M University.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.601
They just make it too hard.

16:52.968 --> 17:08.288
And so, in the early 70s, I was the alumni association president.

17:09.609 --> 17:11.772
As I recall, Bob Latimer succeeded me

17:12.663 --> 17:34.687
And Bob and I had a lot of discussions, but he was perceptive enough to see that the foundation needed to be strengthened, that it needed to be active and could do a great number of things.

17:34.707 --> 17:39.733
I was very much there because I had been involved

17:39.983 --> 17:56.108
by that time in two or three defenses of the Puff Fund, which periodically comes under attack from all universities outside of Texas and NM.

17:56.128 --> 17:58.952
And Texas and NM have to rally together and try to defend it.

18:01.876 --> 18:08.927
I felt that if we didn't have a substantial independent source

18:09.295 --> 18:20.568
of income that A&M couldn't move forward and become a flagship university that they, that the pump fund is going to get nibbled.

18:20.588 --> 18:26.114
Well, in retrospect, you can see that while it's still doing a function, it's getting nibbled all the time.

18:28.597 --> 18:39.049
And the fact that we now are heading for a billion dollar foundation is going to do the thing that early on we envision it should be.

18:39.350 --> 18:47.722
to take the place of some of the things that we're going to lose.

18:47.742 --> 18:57.316
In the early 70s, when the foundation was reactivated, do you have any recollection of the approximate fund?

18:57.657 --> 19:01.322
How big was the foundation's financial total then?

19:01.342 --> 19:05.408
It had around $380,000 in my mind.

19:05.428 --> 19:07.551
That was 1972, I think.

19:08.527 --> 19:34.486
That time Bob appointed herself and some vacancies upon herself and I think Ken Montague and maybe Murray Fasten to the board and that gave it a different complexion.

19:36.369 --> 19:37.791
The next

19:37.923 --> 19:40.846
I was appointed for one year term.

19:40.866 --> 19:46.372
And Bob had made the president come in and say, well, appointed us for one year term.

19:46.392 --> 19:48.374
I want you to be appointed for a full ten years.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.618
Which he did.

19:52.899 --> 19:53.520
Nothing lost.

19:54.521 --> 19:58.345
Were you then the chairman of the foundation board?

19:59.126 --> 20:01.068
I don't remember when.

20:01.088 --> 20:02.209
I was elected chairman.

20:02.780 --> 20:31.656
Probably in 72 and then later in 76 or 78 I served two consecutive terms because Mary Faskin's term was sort of coming up and he said I can't travel around, I can't do all these things lest we serve another term and I did and then later on I was elected chairman another time or two.

20:32.075 --> 20:38.204
employee of the foundation, who was the key fundraiser for the foundation?

20:38.224 --> 20:39.946
Bob Walker.

20:39.966 --> 20:43.171
Describe Walker's work at that time.

20:43.832 --> 20:49.761
Well, Bob is right involved there.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.383
He was

20:52.088 --> 21:05.764
He worked with us and then he became Vice President of the University and Rutledge became the director or the foundation executive.

21:06.485 --> 21:20.982
And I want to put or say this, that Bob Walker's devotions to A&M and all had a great deal to do with the success of the foundation because it had the old idea

21:21.772 --> 21:27.116
prevailed, that these funds ought to move directly to the university.

21:28.738 --> 21:31.600
And let's not let the foundation grow.

21:31.740 --> 21:39.227
And I'm not going to say who was responsible for that, but the record will probably speak for itself if we get into it.

21:40.468 --> 21:48.214
But there was a lack of trust between the association of former students at the university.

21:48.234 --> 21:51.677
And it stemmed from the associations

21:52.433 --> 22:01.726
dogged opposition back there to what the university official stuff had to be done.

22:01.746 --> 22:12.481
It was one of those cases where both sides were wrong, in my opinion, partly, and we just had to go through that period and get everybody on the same track.

22:13.242 --> 22:19.010
What were some of the first major gifts to the foundation that you would call?

22:19.030 --> 22:20.652
Well, the Fasca Foundation

22:20.918 --> 22:26.203
gave us some money and they labeled it.

22:26.223 --> 22:29.006
They didn't specify it to be funds to death.

22:29.026 --> 22:46.482
And then the foundation down in South Texas, the Rochelle Foundation, they gave lots of discretionary money.

22:47.403 --> 22:50.166
And that was the money that enabled us

22:50.551 --> 22:59.580
set up to an organization and all, and the importance of the Rochelle and passing early donations.

22:59.600 --> 23:10.071
And some of the trustees gave minor sons to keep the ball rolling, but those two gave probably the early seed money that was so needed.

23:11.133 --> 23:20.102
And I became, got into the foundation and became chairman due to the generosity of some of the residents of Houston.

23:20.386 --> 23:23.349
I had an airplane made available to me.

23:23.409 --> 23:39.883
And I flew in Austin, Amarillo, San Antonio, different places, and asked to have a meeting, usually an evening meeting, and explained to them that we had a foundation.

23:40.444 --> 23:43.226
Very few people even knew we had a foundation.

23:44.347 --> 23:49.532
And I think that's what Murray asked me because I was doing this thing as we continued to be chairman the second year.

23:50.305 --> 23:53.652
But it started catching on.

23:55.897 --> 23:57.721
Then fell out in West Texas.

24:00.667 --> 24:03.032
The name of the research I can't think of right now.

24:03.052 --> 24:08.724
Gave some land down near Deer Park and down in Pasadena area in Houston.

24:08.744 --> 24:09.445
It was an adventure gift.

24:10.100 --> 24:14.647
It had been sold, it had been quite a bit of money.

24:14.667 --> 24:24.643
Their other gifts started coming in and about the time it looked like we was having a bad time, something else had happened.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.946
We started doing some advertising.

24:26.966 --> 24:33.677
Without mentioning the names, one of the old trustees that was having an order,

24:34.248 --> 24:42.698
told us it was violating Texas trust laws and everything else must have been a foundation corpus for advertising.

24:42.718 --> 24:57.095
And I remember Ken Montague looking right in the eye and said, look, if we have any trouble about that, I'll make up the difference.

24:57.115 --> 25:03.242
But then it turned a little unfortunate about that

25:04.960 --> 25:15.717
By that time Earl Runner died, Dr. Williams came on board.

25:15.797 --> 25:26.755
He embraced the concept that the foundation could be a very meaningful deal.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.217
I remember very well

25:29.243 --> 25:43.078
He called, I think I was chairing at the time, and Jim Sewell was about to be, or just had been, and he called Sewell to his office and said, tell us about, tell me about the foundation.

25:43.098 --> 25:43.599
How do y'all perceive it?

25:43.619 --> 25:44.860
What is its function?

25:44.880 --> 25:45.340
What will it do?

25:46.021 --> 25:55.151
You know, and he said, for instance, ten years from now, how much money will it be in the foundation?

25:55.171 --> 25:58.795
Jim and I looked at each other, and I said, well,

25:59.720 --> 26:06.688
About that time we'd gotten up to about maybe three or four million dollars.

26:06.708 --> 26:09.331
But the prospect really did look good.

26:09.351 --> 26:12.214
We still had him going.

26:12.234 --> 26:18.641
He said, well, I think we'll have 50 million dollars for the foundation in 1985.

26:19.602 --> 26:21.284
So that's Williams asking the question?

26:21.304 --> 26:23.106
Yes, he was asking the question.

26:23.126 --> 26:28.933
And Sue and I were trying to answer it without having any solid basis for what we were saying.

26:29.825 --> 26:33.430
I remember Jack making the audition.

26:34.151 --> 26:40.501
He said, well, if you do, there's going to be a hell of a lot more people interested in that foundation than there are now.

26:43.946 --> 26:52.619
And so, sure enough, in 1985, I think we had considerably more than that many of them in the beginning.

26:52.639 --> 26:54.482
All right, let's back up a little.

26:56.335 --> 27:00.802
How skillful was Mr. Rudder in working with the public?

27:02.104 --> 27:03.526
Aggies and non-Aggies.

27:03.766 --> 27:07.192
Describe his manner of working with people.

27:11.598 --> 27:20.672
I thought that Earl's greatest ability was working with small groups in the room and chairs.

27:21.513 --> 27:32.087
I don't think I'll attempt it to move out and be a real popular figure as far as popularity contests.

27:32.107 --> 27:47.227
And at the time he was making the decisions he did, if he had been watching the polls, he wouldn't have had the fortitude to go do what he had to do.

27:47.247 --> 27:49.410
Jack Williams was probably

27:50.200 --> 28:01.413
more attuned to meeting the whole public and trying to draw strength from that than Earl was.

28:02.274 --> 28:04.517
But it's a kind of strange thing.

28:07.100 --> 28:18.233
And Earl was attuned close to academic progress, but not being an academic musician himself, you see.

28:18.618 --> 28:41.847
it made it a little more difficult and Dr. Williams came in, it was easier for him to foresee what needed to be done and achieve a better and higher academic rating for painting and posture.

28:42.128 --> 28:47.815
So in my opinion, we got some of the best

28:48.200 --> 28:49.161
of times.

28:50.723 --> 28:55.169
Earl had done the things that were tough, hard to do, and all.

28:57.673 --> 29:05.744
And put A&M in a position, someone like Jack Reed, to try to move ahead in academic levels.

29:05.764 --> 29:15.577
The student body was increasing, and the university was changing, and it's just moving and changing.

29:15.597 --> 29:17.700
I tell in one of my speeches,

29:17.866 --> 29:25.234
I say if you had reversed the order and put Williams first and Rudder second, it would have been terrible.

29:25.254 --> 29:26.615
It wouldn't have worked.

29:27.516 --> 29:32.902
But you had to have this one, and then this one could build on top of what the first one did.

29:33.142 --> 29:33.402
That's right.

29:34.083 --> 29:40.710
Make believe that you're, describe Jack Williams for someone that had never seen him or heard him.

29:41.390 --> 29:45.915
Describe him and his style.

29:46.570 --> 29:51.616
Well, let me say something that kind of shows his style.

29:51.636 --> 30:04.150
One of Jack's favorite things when he was going out and meeting with longer groups and he took the time to go out and make any number of A&M club meetings all around the state.

30:05.031 --> 30:15.463
One of the things that made me always think of me, he said, look, I'm looking at this audience and again,

30:16.034 --> 30:25.307
I come to the conclusion that Aggies are the best ones in the world for all the Marys and so on.

30:25.327 --> 30:30.134
I think if you think that through, you see how he approached that type of thing.

30:33.579 --> 30:37.565
Some of the seriousness, young levity.

30:37.585 --> 30:39.547
I was a great fan of him.

30:39.788 --> 30:44.995
I thought he really had done just great things for him.

30:45.295 --> 30:50.100
and moved us from one plane up into another plane.

30:50.300 --> 31:03.412
And I won't say that Earl would have done the same thing, but as you pointed out, Jack couldn't have done the things that Earl did.

31:03.493 --> 31:06.696
He would have been accused of not being an Aggie and not being a Texan.

31:06.876 --> 31:14.323
Yeah, and it took somebody with the guts and fortitude and intelligence

31:15.164 --> 31:20.030
of the program to carry us through that really difficult period.

31:20.050 --> 31:27.858
During those years, who were the key board of, then I think board of directors, who were the key board members in those years?

31:27.878 --> 31:28.639
Let me drop back.

31:28.799 --> 31:29.761
Oh, please do.

31:29.901 --> 31:40.733
On something that, real quick, in mid-sixties, Texas University was not getting
