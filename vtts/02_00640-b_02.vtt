WEBVTT

00:01.178 --> 00:17.213
I was involved in that whole effort from kind of its 
embryo stage up until now, and I went out on the

00:01.178 --> 00:17.213
third cruise of the Gromar Challenger, and I think 
we made some fantastic scientific discoveries on

00:01.178 --> 00:17.213
that. We went across the South Atlantic here and 
drilled a set of holes across Mid-Atlantic Ridge,

00:17.394 --> 00:28.384
and for the first time we were really able to pin 
down all the things that people had said in

00:29.107 --> 00:34.814
seafloor spreading by actually getting samples 
there and dating them and so on. And this was the

00:34.834 --> 00:45.668
first real evidence of seafloor spreading that 
was direct, and I think that's a significant

00:34.834 --> 00:45.668
accomplishment. I think between that and the heat 
flows will be my major accomplishments. I think

00:54.419 --> 00:55.300
I've had some impact from the administrative 
side, but it's tougher to evaluate those, and

00:57.473 --> 01:06.268
there are a lot of administrators around. One

01:06.308 --> 01:16.585
happens to be lucky enough to be in the right spot at 
the right time, and you can have some impact on

01:06.308 --> 01:16.585
things. If you're at the wrong time, it's tough. As 
historians, we call that the monkey bite theory of

01:21.959 --> 01:25.102
history. Crimean War began because a monkey bit a 
Turk on the neck, and we've always maintained that

01:25.122 --> 01:35.752
those people who believe to be in the right spot at 
the right time are believers not in great men, but

01:25.122 --> 01:35.752
in monkey bite theory.

01:38.475 --> 01:39.736
There's a lot to be said for that.

01:46.042 --> 01:49.165
What direction do you foresee Woods Hole going? 
beside more and more applied science. Is there any

01:52.235 --> 01:54.979
particular direction you'd like to take Woods 
Hole to? Well, I

01:57.203 --> 02:12.891
feel that

01:57.203 --> 02:12.891
the one thing that I feel strongest about in making 
Woods Hole a better place

02:15.959 --> 02:20.145
is to develop its independence from the federal 
government a little more than it is. We depend very

02:22.743 --> 02:24.946
highly on grants and contracts. 85% of our support 
or something comes from that. And we're pretty

02:29.653 --> 02:35.421
much at the whim of the federal governments of what 
happens to be in vogue this year and so on. I'd like

02:37.384 --> 02:48.379
to see us develop an independence, and perhaps the 
only way one can do this is through building up the

02:37.384 --> 02:48.379
endowment to the point where we can support a large 
enough fraction of ourself that we have the

02:49.608 --> 03:03.389
independence to do what we feel is right and not 
what happens to be the thing that the government is

02:49.608 --> 03:03.389
supporting at that particular time. Now, a lot of 
times these match very nicely. They match mainly

03:07.115 --> 03:09.539
by necessity, I guess. If we're not doing what the 
government's supporting, we end up not doing

03:11.081 --> 03:16.830
anything. were forced into that, and I'd like to 
break away a little bit from this sense of being

03:17.873 --> 03:27.063
tied to the government. I think that's the single 
biggest change I could foresee happening here. Do

03:33.830 --> 03:42.500
you find personally that there are more 
bureaucratic entanglements and snares now than

03:33.830 --> 03:42.500
there were, say, ten years ago in dealing with the 
government? Oh, yes. Every time you turn around,

03:46.983 --> 03:58.335
And the government is tending to use its 
contracting powers over a lot of people to

03:46.983 --> 03:58.335
accomplish a lot of its social aims. And sometimes 
these accomplish the ends, and other times they

03:58.415 --> 04:12.450
just cause more complication and cost than they 
might be working on. I'm sure you've heard

04:12.717 --> 04:32.830
examples of this from the OSHA, the Affirmative 
Action, to handicap, to all the kind of

04:12.717 --> 04:32.830
regulations that get put upon you

04:12.717 --> 04:32.830
and make business more costly, more expensive, 
and hopefully reaching some end. I think they are

04:32.850 --> 04:33.931
useful. I don't object to what these programs are 
trying to do.

04:42.046 --> 04:44.057
There may be better ways of accomplishing And it 
makes life very complicated here, and we're

04:44.611 --> 05:13.875
forced to build up an infrastructure in terms of 
bureaucracy here to match the bureaucracy that

04:44.611 --> 05:13.875
gets put on us by Washington, which tends to make, 
gets the administration in bad with the

04:44.611 --> 05:13.875
scientists, because it looks like we're getting 
bigger, taking more of their money as they see it,

04:44.611 --> 05:13.875
and yet it's one of the necessities in life to do 
this. I'm not sure there's any way of getting

05:16.032 --> 05:17.875
around it.

05:21.561 --> 05:23.243
But life has become complicated. Grants seem to be 
getting smaller. We're writing more and more

05:26.348 --> 05:28.792
proposals. The proposals are getting more and 
more complicated, thicker.

05:35.603 --> 05:38.007
We looked at last year and found out that we were I 
think we have something of the order of 400

05:39.387 --> 05:45.116
individual grants and contracts at this place 
here. It's something of the order of two a working

05:45.176 --> 05:47.700
day. So that means roughly two proposals a day on 
the average go out of this institution. It has to be

05:54.872 --> 06:00.501
written by somebody and reviewed and read. 
Usually these are just for a one-year thing. Each

06:03.626 --> 06:10.798
scientist, on the average, must have about three 
or four contracts. He spends a large fraction of

06:12.440 --> 06:15.505
his time writing proposals. It's a waste of 
effort. It wasn't this way in the past. Again, this

06:20.393 --> 06:25.662
ties into the peer review system and the 
competition. If somehow there are ways to reduce

06:27.481 --> 06:41.841
this, and there are ways that you can do this,

06:27.481 --> 06:41.841
NSF would simply go to three- or four-year grants 
and stop a little bit of it. There are some

06:43.423 --> 06:45.306
disadvantages in this. If you give a grant for 
three or four years and you fix the budget, by the

06:45.386 --> 06:54.298
time the fourth year comes along, the inflation 
has ruined you and the The guy dies his fourth year,

06:55.072 --> 07:05.401
he can't keep things going because he can't 
possibly estimate what's going to happen in terms

06:55.072 --> 07:05.401
of cost.

07:08.203 --> 07:19.252
But nonetheless, I think longer term grants would 
be a move in the right direction to get off this

07:08.203 --> 07:19.252
proposal writing treadmill that everybody's on. 
And it's not restricted to us. It's the same all

07:21.054 --> 07:22.335
over. There's even talk about seven and ten year 
grants. Well, that's an interesting thought. One

07:32.748 --> 07:46.567
ought to think of, if you're going in terms of 
seven- and ten-year grants, of tying this a little

07:32.748 --> 07:46.567
bit in with the tenure system of universities, 
which is an archaic system.

07:46.587 --> 07:48.670
Maybe there's a better way of doing both of these.

07:52.447 --> 08:06.320
When you talk in terms of specialization of 
younger oceanographers, I have a feeling that,

07:52.447 --> 08:06.320
too, is academic-wide because it's difficult for 
a young man to be a generalist or work on group

07:52.447 --> 08:06.320
projects when he always faces the problems of 
developing tenure. That's right. Not only

08:08.181 --> 08:17.810
developing tenure, but he's in this proposal 
competition in oceanography no matter where he's

08:08.181 --> 08:17.810
at. You've got to be specialized to compete in 
that.

08:27.766 --> 08:34.592
And the whole tenure system is, well, I don't know 
that the tenure system is so much set up as

08:27.766 --> 08:34.592
specialization. You've got to make your mark 
somehow. And you've got to be able to prove it. And

08:39.357 --> 08:42.319
you usually prove it by publications and so on. But 
these can be done. And it's harder to do in a

08:45.763 --> 08:49.626
generalized point of view. And usually only the 
more senior people that have been in longer and

08:49.766 --> 08:57.013
have a broader overview are capable of doing that. 
So it's easier to do this, the more specialized you

08:57.466 --> 09:04.994
are, because you know more about it than anyone 
else in the business. You're the only guy that's

09:05.034 --> 09:07.617
thought about it, essentially. And it's easier to 
get ahead that way. It's essentially the way the

09:12.803 --> 09:17.408
whole research game has gone over a number of 
years.

09:20.631 --> 09:21.332
All right. So personally, possibly a return to 
research.

09:28.313 --> 09:33.859
moving more and more away from the federal 
bureaucracy, possibly in terms of your

09:28.313 --> 09:33.859
institution. What else in the future? Well, I've 
spent a lot of my activities in the last few years on

09:38.084 --> 09:47.475
things outside of Woods Hole.

09:50.378 --> 09:53.882
And I suspect that's where I get a lot of my 
satisfaction now. You know, you can get it out of

09:54.723 --> 10:00.812
research, but you've got to be in the trenches on 
the front line doing the research to get this. And

10:00.912 --> 10:05.919
it's difficult to do research from an 
administrative position. I find it very

10:06.059 --> 10:07.802
difficult. You just can't spend the time on it that 
you need. And you don't get much satisfaction out

10:11.427 --> 10:20.460
of solving everybody else's problems and trying 
to keep the place going. So the way that one tends to

10:21.149 --> 10:31.859
contribute when you're in an administrative job 
is doing things on the outside, on

10:21.149 --> 10:31.859
committees and so forth. I'm president of the 
American Geophysical Union now, which turned out

10:31.879 --> 10:38.926
to be more work than I thought. But again, I find 
this a satisfying thing to work on these kind of

10:39.127 --> 10:49.857
things, spend some time in there.

10:55.945 --> 11:01.150
I guess as time goes on, I might even spend more 
time. If I can get free from, get organized well

11:02.972 --> 11:11.140
enough to do my inside chores in less time so I have 
more free time to do it.

11:19.549 --> 11:22.952
What were your major disappointments as an 
oceanographer? What did you want desperately to

11:22.972 --> 11:25.615
succeed, which failed?

11:40.512 --> 11:43.195
That's the toughest one yet.

11:47.159 --> 11:50.702
I guess I've been pretty fortunate that most of the 
things have gone pretty well. I was a little

11:52.124 --> 11:57.169
disappointed when the Moho got shot down. Put a 
little bit of effort into that.

12:07.579 --> 12:09.321
I think, in general, things have gone. pretty 
well. No real complaints. Okay. And I take it if you

12:14.782 --> 12:18.529
had all of it over again, you would choose to do it 
roughly the same way? I suspect so. I don't know

12:20.593 --> 12:25.562
where I'd make any different decisions right now. 
Is there anything you'd like to add to the tape?

12:30.551 --> 12:31.513
No, I can't. I'm sure that By the time you're 
halfway back to Texas, I'll think of a lot of things

12:34.883 --> 12:42.093
that I should have mentioned to you. Hindsight's 
always easier than foresight. No, I can't think of

12:47.120 --> 12:48.943
anything. I've enjoyed the opportunity to sit and 
chat with you this way. Oh, it's been my pleasure.

12:55.332 --> 13:01.701
You know, it would be interesting, you say you're 
not going to write this history, you're just

12:55.332 --> 13:01.701
making it available online. For everybody else, 
on the other hand, you have talked personally to

13:02.744 --> 13:14.775
all these people, and you probably have a much 
better feeling than what's just on tape. And it

13:16.216 --> 13:32.751
seems to me it's a shame that you can't put some kind 
of story together, even if it's kind of a human

13:16.216 --> 13:32.751
interest story on bits and pieces, how you see 
things fall together and so

13:16.216 --> 13:32.751
on. I have two regrets about this project that I 
began tonight. One thing I regret is very simple. I

13:38.727 --> 13:41.230
wish every place I had gone, I had taken a camera. 
I'm sorry now that I haven't put together a

13:42.211 --> 13:48.298
portfolio of oceanographers. That'd be 
interesting. So that when people listen to the

13:49.259 --> 13:54.305
tapes or read the transcript, they couldn't see 
them. And the second thing I wish I had done is I wish

13:54.325 --> 14:01.033
I had, every time after I had left an interview, I'd 
sit down with my typewriter for 35 minutes and

14:01.418 --> 14:03.581
typed up my impressions of that individual. Well, 
that's the kind of things that I was meaning. You

14:07.186 --> 14:11.612
know, you've got a feeling that goes along with 
just what's on tape. And you've talked to a lot of

14:12.574 --> 14:25.792
people on this, at least from what I've heard you 
say, and these are all very knowledgeable people,

14:12.574 --> 14:25.792
and I think it would be nice. I've often wondered 
why somebody hasn't put down a good history of

14:30.595 --> 14:35.221
oceanography. And I think just to put it on tape and 
leave it is kind of a shame. On the other hand, I

14:38.865 --> 14:44.152
suspect you've got another year's worth of taping 
or something like that. Probably, if we're

14:44.692 --> 14:48.217
financed again, that's certain. Another year's 
worth of taping. I think we need to. I think also we

14:50.720 --> 14:52.802
need to make secondary interviews. I think one of 
the things that we need to do, you're speaking of

14:52.923 --> 14:56.287
things you remember far away. I think one thing 
that... One weakness in the writing of

14:58.844 --> 15:12.944
oceanography is after they put all this down, if 
they would go back and talk to the people again and

14:58.844 --> 15:12.944
see how they perceive it a second time, it'd make a 
sizable difference to what they're saying. I had a

15:12.965 --> 15:24.521
similar interview with a guy from Stanford who was 
kind of putting together a history on seafloor

15:12.965 --> 15:24.521
spray, plate tectonics. I've forgotten what his 
name was.

15:31.008 --> 15:41.402
He was going around the country interviewing a lot 
of scientists to try and get their opinion of how

15:31.008 --> 15:41.402
they thought plate tectonics developed.

15:43.164 --> 15:49.392
And that's sort of the whole story of the field that 
I've been in. That's been kind of the crowning

15:49.412 --> 15:51.635
glory. It's been like the Darwin theory of 
evolution in biology. It's been that sort of

15:58.424 --> 16:00.627
equivalent for geology. has that much of an impact 
on geology. And we were all part of that. So I'd love

16:09.588 --> 16:13.674
to see this story develop sometime. I don't know 
whether it'll ever come out or whether it's just

16:13.754 --> 16:19.162
going to end up taped there. But the other thing 
that has been missing, and you're getting a lot of

16:19.182 --> 16:27.915
this, is how oceanography got started in this 
country. And guys like Revell, when he was a

16:30.863 --> 16:41.416
commander in the Navy, and Mary Sears, who was 
working down with him, Charlie Fishu, who was in

16:30.863 --> 16:41.416
Rhode Island, went down there for a little while. 
These guys were all part of this business getting

16:41.436 --> 16:45.261
started. And it's sort of going by the way. They're 
all disappearing now. Yeah. Sure are. And

16:52.690 --> 16:53.551
rapidly. Menzies died last year, you know? Bob 
Menzies? Yes. I don't know about that. You know,

16:58.977 --> 17:07.330
Sumner Pike, as well as the great ones like Ewing 
and Islum, there are just not any place for them to

16:58.977 --> 17:07.330
take. That's right. Sumner would have been a great 
one to interview. He's such a bullshitter and a

17:10.134 --> 17:13.900
gentleman. He's a great guy. I think of him as one of 
the nicest people I've ever met. He was just such a

17:22.614 --> 17:24.537
great person. I got to know him quite well.

17:30.398 --> 17:39.193
If

17:30.398 --> 17:39.193
you ever have time, it'll take a long time, you'll 
have to listen to my tape with Roger Revelle. Oh,

17:39.593 --> 17:40.354
I'd love to. You know, I know Roger so well. I'm 
afraid that when Revelle dies, that one of the

17:44.081 --> 17:53.436
things they're going to have to understand, that 
scientists and historians are going to have to

17:44.081 --> 17:53.436
understand is why he was so great. And if you can be 
with him for a while and captures enthusiasm and

17:54.091 --> 18:01.017
human quality, it's just absolutely 
overwhelming. Yeah, he is such a compassionate

18:01.597 --> 18:04.440
person. And

18:04.580 --> 18:10.325
he's always been that way.

18:17.491 --> 18:23.676
He just doesn't think in small terms or in small 
things. I think he's one of the great scientists of

18:24.027 --> 18:30.716
our time. Not that he's so much of a scientist, but 
he's one of the great figures in science of our

18:32.197 --> 18:39.326
time. Probably more underestimated than almost 
any. He just has never

18:45.454 --> 18:52.363
I think made the mark that I really feel that he 
deserves.

19:01.996 --> 19:10.784
Part of this must be the fact that he changed fields 
in the middle of his career.

19:10.804 --> 19:15.448
He certainly reached the top in oceanography, and 
there wasn't much else to go there.

19:18.931 --> 19:20.933
Well, he wanted desperately to be chancellor of 
San Diego. Yeah. I suppose that he being himself

19:24.320 --> 19:36.776
and the regents being themselves, the political 
division was just simply too great.

19:36.796 --> 19:37.397
It's too bad. Too bad for San Diego. Too bad for... 
What do you want to do? You know, I talked to him when

19:43.164 --> 19:45.327
that happened. I was in Washington.

19:51.615 --> 19:51.915
It was... saying what, wondering what he should 
do. I

19:55.914 --> 20:12.476
talked to some people

19:55.914 --> 20:12.476
that found out this job was available in the 
Interior Department. I think it was Assistant

20:12.496 --> 20:14.038
Secretary of Interior. It wasn't Assistant. It 
was sort of Science Advisor for the Interior

20:14.859 --> 20:20.847
Department. And I sort of helped talk them in. 
Coming back to Washington, he spent about a year in

20:23.587 --> 20:30.917
Washington in that job, as I recall. And it was a 
real transition zone. I guess he went from there to

20:34.803 --> 20:36.425
Harvard. I'm not quite sure. I assume it was in that 
job where he worked in Pakistan for a while. And I

20:44.577 --> 20:48.462
think after he got back from there, he went on to the 
Population Control Center at Harvard. Well, he

20:48.482 --> 20:49.864
certainly continued to work in Pakistan.

20:54.653 --> 20:59.922
He was very worried about the problems of the world 
and people.
