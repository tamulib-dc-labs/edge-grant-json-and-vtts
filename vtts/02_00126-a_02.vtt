WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:08.233
but

00:03.187 --> 00:08.233
I was naive enough that I didn't. A fellow sat 
pretty close to me. Ah, I see. Other than that, I

00:12.379 --> 00:14.361
didn't know really what it was after. Nobody ever 
tried to get any money from you or get you drunk?

00:22.171 --> 00:24.975
Generally, you felt comfortable. That's what 
I've heard over and over and over. And you never

00:28.539 --> 00:30.662
used a sign... to hold up with your destination? 
And if

00:35.140 --> 00:44.355
you were going from here to Olney, what route did 
you take? Could

00:45.397 --> 00:54.692
you do that in a day? Most of the times we did it that 
day, a couple of times I spent a night someplace.

01:03.929 --> 01:04.309
Let's see. So you didn't eat, that freshman year, 
you didn't eat many meals on the campus? No. The

01:11.996 --> 01:24.628
only time that you ate is occasionally you'd go 
over the YMCA where they had a soda shop and you

01:11.996 --> 01:24.628
would just get a drink there or soda or something of 
the sort. Do you remember how much money,

01:25.402 --> 01:29.789
spendable money, you had that first year? Not very 
much. Probably less

01:34.617 --> 01:38.523
than $50. I calculated the entire cost of that 
first year was $325. Tuition, clothes, meals. Had

01:48.819 --> 01:53.046
your father given you any particular part of a herd 
or acreage for you to work and save money from? No,

01:57.686 --> 02:01.050
in my 4-H work, I was given... Okay. I bought cattle 
and things of this sort. And so you saved from that?

02:05.534 --> 02:06.475
I saved from that. About how much did you have in 
your account? Do you remember? Oh, I think we had

02:09.718 --> 02:14.764
almost $600, $700, $800. Oh. Pretty much. By 
today's standards, that's a good sum. I do recall

02:21.460 --> 02:29.292
coming back the second semester of my sophomore 
year, I had to borrow from my brother's account. I

02:31.135 --> 02:31.936
did not work. While you were here? While I was here. 
I had no job. Except the last year, I did have a small

02:35.982 --> 02:40.850
paying job.

02:43.173 --> 02:45.477
Let's see, in terms of your freshman year, as you 
now look back, what were the key academic classes

02:45.743 --> 02:53.714
that you took that freshman year and the impact 
they had on you? The English class, classes, the

02:56.298 --> 03:07.514
course in agricultural economics had an impact 
because I began to learn the world. Of course, I

03:08.635 --> 03:13.642
felt at home in the animal science class or animal 
husbandry class. Mm-hmm. probably I learned a

03:15.764 --> 03:19.048
great deal. I'd say most of them, but probably the 
most impact course as I came along was a course in

03:19.409 --> 03:27.099
chemistry. Who taught that? Do you remember? Was 
the instructor part of the impact? The fellow whom

03:35.650 --> 03:45.082
for this fire is named after.

03:45.102 --> 03:45.703
Not Isbell. Not Texas, well, I don't know.

03:52.934 --> 03:56.138
When did you begin to think about what your major 
was going to be? At the outset. Okay. You had your

03:58.682 --> 03:59.764
mind made up? I was going to be an animal husbandry 
major no matter what. Okay, okay. I came here with

04:04.010 --> 04:05.513
that idea. I was going to be an animal husbandry 
major. It never changed, except there was a bottle

04:07.936 --> 04:15.808
or two along the way, and I had some ideas that I had. 
What did you think was the expected routine for

04:16.430 --> 04:24.088
going to class? How did a student behave in class 
and so forth? The expected routine was that you

04:32.729 --> 04:34.894
went to class. It was never any thought of missing a 
class. The only time that you missed a class was

04:39.851 --> 04:45.979
when you were ill or in a hospital or something of 
that sort where you just simply couldn't make it.

04:48.944 --> 04:53.990
We walked into class, sat down, took notes, 
followed the instruction. The instructor was it.

04:56.414 --> 04:57.135
He knew everything. And so that was where we were 
learning. It's a duality of learning. Right or

05:03.103 --> 05:06.788
wrong, yes or no, this is it. Do you remember any 
incidents where someone went to sleep and what the

05:07.628 --> 05:13.335
instructor did? Not until, not the freshman year. 
Okay. Go ahead to the others. Well, sophomore year

05:20.744 --> 05:27.672
in chemistry class, the instructor was an 
interesting kind of a thing. He'd throw chalk at

05:27.692 --> 05:31.677
the guy.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.302
That... freshman year you didn't have any problem 
passing your work? Not at all. I was distinguished

05:44.372 --> 05:45.895
both semesters. I had a 2.25 waypoint ratio, a 
little better. Under the old three-point. And

05:53.005 --> 05:57.793
what did, what were your mom and dad's reaction to 
your work? They were happy. They were happy. I

06:01.274 --> 06:06.019
don't think they were effusive, but they were 
happy.

06:06.520 --> 06:10.745
They were happy to have me home in the summertime, 
and they were missing me. Back home in the summer,

06:11.646 --> 06:13.287
what did you do? Well, I helped my dad. Worked on the 
farm. Did you get paid? No. Did you get an

06:20.416 --> 06:24.340
allowance?

06:24.360 --> 06:24.420
No. I understand that fully. That was the routine I 
had. During

06:29.438 --> 06:44.014
your undergraduate years here, can you recall and 
share any jokes, prank, good bull that you either

06:29.438 --> 06:44.014
were part of or you observed? Not really, no. As I 
say, it was kind of a shock. I need to tell you that

06:49.199 --> 06:59.310
during the sophomore year, I came back at the 
beginning of the sophomore year into Russell

06:49.199 --> 06:59.310
Hall,

07:01.805 --> 07:08.591
was assigned to another unit called D Battery 
Field Artillery, which was a truck-drawn unit.

07:11.354 --> 07:27.449
And I began to feel that if you were going to be on 
campus or be at Texas A&M University,

07:11.354 --> 07:27.449
you better associate yourself with the Corps. So 
in the middle of the sophomore year, first

07:27.469 --> 07:31.373
semester of the sophomore year, I moved into 
dormitories and stayed there all the way through.

07:37.334 --> 07:40.738
Was there any reaction by the other sophomores? 
Not really. I think I was assigned a roommate that

07:45.845 --> 07:53.836
the others might have felt funny about. But they 
didn't call you a frog or anything? Didn't treat

07:58.370 --> 07:59.732
you like a transfer. I had gone through a fish year. 
I was fish couple the first year. I was a sophomore

08:02.696 --> 08:09.645
and expected to do the hazing at the sophomores and 
to respond as a sophomore would. And it was an

08:09.705 --> 08:14.551
integration, complete integration at the very 
outset. Now, what dormitory were you in then, that

08:14.571 --> 08:18.276
second? All right, and this is in, quote, the new 
dorm area. The new dorm area. But there were still,

08:24.728 --> 08:29.792
part of the Corps was still housed in the North Gate 
area? No, then. Oh, they were all down in the...

08:33.836 --> 08:34.616
They were down then. Oh, okay. All right. So now... 
It didn't happen until the moving to the part of the

08:36.998 --> 08:45.065
Corps to the North Gate area did not come to the 
completion of the dormitories up here. Okay.

08:45.866 --> 08:47.487
Which was, what, 42? Okay.

08:50.930 --> 08:54.313
So now you were part of the entire Corps routine.

08:57.618 --> 09:09.091
I was within it, and I came along and

08:57.618 --> 09:09.091
went through the ROTC situation. Came back my 
seventh and eighth junior year, expecting to

09:10.032 --> 09:19.462
continue in the Corps and flunk the physical. 
Really? Yes. I had

09:21.805 --> 09:27.591
what they would call a pilonidal cyst. that I'd 
been born with and apparently this was this kind of

09:27.841 --> 09:47.470
discounted any officer being at it because it 
could become infected I never had any infection so

09:27.841 --> 09:47.470
I might say that during the Christmas holidays I 
went into Wichita Falls and had the thing cut out

09:47.990 --> 10:02.608
and came back and by the end of the junior year I was 
in contract, but I ended up the following as a

09:47.990 --> 10:02.608
senior year with what is known as a one-button 
second lieutenant. I lost all the, well I don't

10:03.689 --> 10:14.723
know whether my military career would have, or my 
military abilities would have sent me up along But

10:15.800 --> 10:18.525
you remained in the Corps all four years. In the 
same unit, D Battery Field Artillery. I graduated

10:23.053 --> 10:26.479
out of D Battery Field Artillery. And by far the 
majority of the student body was in the Corps all

10:26.700 --> 10:31.609
four years, weren't they? Oh, I'd say yes, by far. 
Well, everybody was in the Corps, with the

10:34.213 --> 10:40.204
exception of some graduate students. were not in 
the Corps, even if you were physically unfit, you

10:40.387 --> 10:48.636
were still in the Corps. They didn't have, I guess 
maybe they had what is equivalent to DNC today, but

10:48.656 --> 11:00.228
it was a ceremony, but you didn't know it. That was a 
living quarters for students where that's where

11:00.388 --> 11:05.393
they had to be. Your four years were from the fall of 
39, to January 43. 43. During those years, as you

11:15.246 --> 11:28.786
look back, please describe some of the memorable 
teachers, advisors, counselors that you recall,

11:15.246 --> 11:28.786
people that touched your life. Well, it turned out 
that the one person that touched my life more, and I

11:30.769 --> 11:40.684
continue to touch it after I came back, was a 
teacher by the name of Paul Pearson.

11:43.432 --> 11:45.215
and take a course in nutrition. I liked it. I had the 
chemistry, and I decided that maybe that I wanted

11:46.737 --> 11:55.791
to do this kind of thing. Curiously, another 
professor that I enjoyed and had was Dr. John

11:55.812 --> 12:04.105
Miloff, veterinary medicine. See, I decided that 
I wanted to be, possibly be, a veterinarian. My

12:11.647 --> 12:13.509
parents put the kibosh to that. You are not going to 
be a veterinarian. We're going to pay for four

12:14.891 --> 12:15.952
years. That's it. You're on your own after that. So 
I went to see Dean Marsteller and Dean Kyle. And

12:28.388 --> 12:39.041
Dean Marsteller gave me permission to take the

12:28.388 --> 12:39.041
veterinary courses in the first year of 
veterinary medicine. While you were still an

12:39.061 --> 12:40.202
undergraduate? Junior year.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.976
Were there many that got to do that? As far as I know, 
I was the only one. As far as I know, I'm not the only

12:51.382 --> 12:54.967
one to ever do that. I don't know of any. I've never 
heard of anyone else that did that. That was, of

12:59.774 --> 13:11.151
course, the best year of my life because that 
essentially

12:59.774 --> 13:11.151
built the background upon which I built my 
graduate work That's on to coming into the

13:12.548 --> 13:19.318
professorial positions and that sort. All right, 
who were some others? You mentioned a couple. Who

13:22.022 --> 13:26.028
were some other faculty members that made a 
difference? Bill Warren, John Riggs. Bill Warren

13:29.212 --> 13:30.074
was there. John Riggs, particularly. You had to 
like him. E.P. Humbert. That's a new name for me.

13:39.970 --> 13:44.134
H-U-M-B-E-R-T.

13:39.970 --> 13:44.134
What did he do? The head of the Department of 
Genetics. And he took the beginning course in

13:47.318 --> 13:50.041
genetics. Later on, John Quisenberry came into 
play, but took a course in animal breeding under

13:51.382 --> 13:58.970
him, in genetics.

14:04.756 --> 14:05.136
P.W. Williams.

14:08.658 --> 14:10.160
He would later become... He became acting 
president of the university and the Williams...

14:10.600 --> 14:21.474
Now, he was animal science? He was animal science. 
He was head of animal science. Who were some

14:26.460 --> 14:32.267
characters you remember, character teachers, 
idiosyncrasies? Snooks. Who? A fellow by the name

14:35.030 --> 14:35.931
of Snooks. What did he teach, and why was he 
unusual? He was unusual. He'd come to class, and

14:42.030 --> 14:45.795
he'd turn the water on. You see this water? You 
don't touch it. It's mine. It's mine. And he would

14:51.002 --> 14:57.171
write on the blackboard and then erase it 
immediately. He would look out the window. He was

15:01.897 --> 15:03.319
clearly a character. Now, he's not the one that 
caught the student cheating with his watch, was

15:04.362 --> 15:09.850
it? It could have been. It could have been. 
Somebody told me an incident about where the

15:13.636 --> 15:24.472
person teaching one of the big general chemistry 
courses, he thought he saw this student cheating

15:13.636 --> 15:24.472
on the final. And so he goes out the back door, comes 
all the way around, walks up to the back of the

15:25.173 --> 15:32.023
student, and... the student is looking at this 
watch, and he says, okay, stand up, I caught you.

15:38.434 --> 15:41.517
Now stand up and read what you got on that watch. And 
as the student thrust the watch in front of the

15:42.438 --> 15:50.146
faculty member, he read it, and it said, I fooled 
you this time, you old son of a bitch. But this

15:52.868 --> 15:54.130
wasn't Snooks. All right, who, some other, some 
other characters.

16:00.876 --> 16:01.317
Some other characters. That was bad. Those were 
pretty reasonable people. Let's see, the YMC,

16:03.728 --> 16:07.232
there was no MSC. Describe what it provided for 
students. I don't know what in particular it

16:13.279 --> 16:15.982
provided for students. The only thing that I could 
see that it provided was a place where Lutherans

16:16.242 --> 16:22.549
could gather on campus. Missouri Synod. All 
right, and what did you, Missouri Synod

16:24.972 --> 16:28.656
Lutherans, when did you gather and what did you do? 
We'd gather in the afternoons or we'd gather in the

16:28.696 --> 16:32.520
evenings or... times we formed what is known as a 
club. Then when they built the church in Bryan,

16:38.429 --> 16:44.715
some of us became members of that church. Now, when 
you all got together, was it always religion that

16:46.336 --> 16:50.960
you talked about? Not necessarily. I'm sure other 
things such as football entered into the picture.

16:57.627 --> 17:01.410
Were there some off-campus people that supported 
you? Were there any key? There was a fellow that I

17:04.905 --> 17:23.240
knew, the Reverend Henry Traubach, 
T-R-A-U-G-O-T-T,

17:04.905 --> 17:23.240
who was living at Curtin at the time, and he came in, 
and we did not have a Lutheran church, Missouri

17:04.905 --> 17:23.240
Synod, in either Bryan or College Station. There 
was one in another Lutheran church, but we had been

17:24.509 --> 17:32.661
taught so strictly that we thought that was a bunch 
of heretics.

17:35.365 --> 17:39.230
Let's see, were the Kunze boys, did they overlap 
with you? Yes. And they were Missouri Synod?

17:42.375 --> 17:45.058
George was a junior when I was a senior. And he was 
Missouri Synod, was he not? Missouri Synod. Okay.

17:50.058 --> 17:55.783
Let's see, MSC, Guyon Hall. What do you remember 
that happened in Guyon Hall? Oh, Guyon Hall was a

17:59.527 --> 18:04.732
wonderful place that we always had. Town Hall it 
was called. We all had tickets to Town Hall. And all

18:10.557 --> 18:15.242
the programs, they were generally classic or 
semi-classical. So this was music?

18:19.133 --> 18:22.037
Do you remember any of the performers?

18:26.983 --> 18:28.305
No, I don't.

18:31.670 --> 18:34.774
What about, were there some notable speakers?

18:37.297 --> 18:39.120
I don't recall any. What about Religious Emphasis 
Week? Was it held then? I don't recall. I don't

18:43.886 --> 18:44.587
think so. Because I know it was after the war. I 
don't know about before that. Religious Emphasis

18:48.918 --> 18:50.560
Week. Did you go to movies at Gine Hall? We did 
movies at Gine Hall. No, there was an assembly hall

18:54.245 --> 18:57.170
that movies had mostly. More often we'd go into 
Bryan for movies. Hitchhiking to Bryan. Because

19:01.576 --> 19:03.699
you didn't have a car. I didn't have a car. Very few 
people had cars. In fact, it was almost forbidden

19:09.106 --> 19:12.831
for students to have cars. Mm-hmm. Let's see, in 
Guyon Hall, did anybody ever create any mischief

19:15.648 --> 19:23.899
during a movie or a concert? Oh, not during 
concerts, but during a movie occasionally we'd

19:25.662 --> 19:36.136
have somebody come up with a loud expletive. Oh, 
okay, okay. Do you remember any famous, during

19:39.401 --> 19:45.469
your undergraduate days, do you remember any 
famous visitors to the campus? Don't remember any

19:47.339 --> 19:51.345
presidents or generals or anything like that. 
Eisenhower came in. I was not here when he came.

19:59.698 --> 20:00.679
That's after the war. The Secretary of 
Agriculture came in one time. Henry Wallace? No.

20:14.390 --> 20:17.834
Let's see, football games. 1939 was a pretty good 
year for the Aggie football team. It was a very good

20:22.721 --> 20:24.743
year. I started football believing that Aggies 
couldn't lose.

20:30.651 --> 20:36.618
Of course, the yell practice was held in front of 
the YMCA. Describe a yell practice in those days.

20:41.980 --> 20:48.770
Was

20:41.980 --> 20:48.770
it late on Friday evening? Yes. I don't know that it 
was a midnight Yale practice in the same sense. But

20:57.423 --> 20:58.364
it was after dark? After dark. Did young ladies, if 
anybody had a date, did they take their date to Yale

21:02.551 --> 21:06.757
practice? Yes. They were always welcome. They 
came down. There were a few, but they were there.

21:14.380 --> 21:18.606
And come in, either local ladies or TSCW. And you 
all, on Saturday, the routine, was it similar to

21:19.787 --> 21:29.360
today in terms of marching into? We all marched in, 
yes. And did you? We all marched in. Of course, that

21:34.166 --> 21:36.530
was a student body. And you stood and? We stood. 
During the first half and the second half and sat

21:39.676 --> 21:48.947
down during the... Did you have, during your 
undergraduate days, did you have a date for many

21:39.676 --> 21:48.947
games?

21:51.990 --> 21:55.655
In my senior year, I had two or three dates for 
games. And where were they from? Local.

22:00.981 --> 22:02.022
Currently, really, to be sure. Okay, okay.

22:06.798 --> 22:13.506
Did you do the court trips that year to the 
out-of-town games? We went to court trips to

22:13.946 --> 22:16.990
Houston, Fort Worth, Dallas. How did you... By 
train. By train. And where did you stay? Um...

22:25.998 --> 22:29.762
Usually in some hotel, basically. It was never a 
particular problem or we moved in with somebody

22:29.782 --> 22:35.688
that we knew. Somebody

22:35.728 --> 22:44.597
had a home there or stayed there or something of 
that sort. Do you remember any major events for any

22:44.617 --> 22:51.043
of the Corps trips during your undergraduate 
days?

22:54.213 --> 23:00.062
Was there any that you enjoyed more or far less than 
any of the others? What was your favorite court

23:00.903 --> 23:02.205
trip? My favorite court trip was always to 
Houston. It was shorter and you could get by. I had a

23:08.394 --> 23:12.279
roommate from Galveston. So you'd go down there 
and stay with him? Stay with him. And you marched

23:15.604 --> 23:16.746
down Main Street? Marched down whatever Main 
Street there was. All right, like in Houston, Rice

23:21.837 --> 23:31.889
is a good distance from the middle of downtown. How 
did the Corps get from the middle of downtown down

23:32.550 --> 23:38.257
to Rice Stadium? You know, I was wondering about 
that. I don't recall. Because it's too far to walk.

23:44.315 --> 23:51.522
I always had a ride or something, an automobile 
ride. The reason why I don't remember is because it

23:51.783 --> 23:56.327
was never a problem, I guess. Okay, okay. While you 
were an undergraduate, what were the major

23:58.830 --> 24:04.535
student organizations on campus? What student 
organizations had high prestige and

24:18.436 --> 24:23.462
Well, it was an organization I did not know about.

24:28.309 --> 24:37.080
But apparently a number of the students belonged 
to,

24:28.309 --> 24:37.080
particularly the military leaders in the Corps. 
You're talking about one of the secret

24:37.861 --> 24:40.784
fraternities? One of the secret fraternities. As 
far as you know, or knew then, Or as far as you know

24:47.815 --> 24:52.500
now about then, how many of those were there? How 
many of those secret fraternities? As far as I

24:54.663 --> 24:56.184
know, there was only one. The TTs? The TTs. Two 
Texans. Do you have any idea how many were in the

25:00.729 --> 25:03.212
TTs? No idea. I know I came across a situation and 
tried to come up with them and lost pretty heavily

25:04.293 --> 25:14.064
because of it. That requires a bit of explanation. 
Mm-hmm. During my junior year, I decided that I was

25:18.933 --> 25:27.301
going to do, so I signed up with the Longhorn. I 
became a staff member of the Longhorn. The

25:31.024 --> 25:32.105
yearbook. Yearbook. And was one of the editors, or 
one of the staff people as far as yearbook was

25:34.127 --> 25:43.475
concerned. And of course, I ran against the fellow 
who finally became editor it was an election

25:46.878 --> 26:15.973
process

25:46.878 --> 26:15.973
for editor of the yearbook in 19 last year was there 
1942 43 yearbook uh lost lost pretty heavily and it

25:46.878 --> 26:15.973
was a blow to my ego at that particular point and as 
far as you know then later on I learned that a lot of

25:46.878 --> 26:15.973
the people that were running for office and things 
for all these people that were in the True Texan

26:16.342 --> 26:21.730
organization. I was never there. I was sort of an 
outsider then. Maybe that's what I resented a

26:26.778 --> 26:31.445
little bit about my classmates as far as I'm 
concerned. As far as I have been able to learn about

26:32.586 --> 26:43.142
the TTs and any other group, their primary purpose 
seems to have been to get their own members into

26:44.303 --> 26:48.288
positions of student leadership. That's right. 
That's the best I can get. That's the best I can get.

26:51.453 --> 26:53.796
They did it.

26:55.899 --> 26:59.824
And nobody knew exactly how many they were or where 
they met. Is that right?

27:04.530 --> 27:04.911
Let's see. The key organizations, the band, which 
I was not a member of, obviously. But was it? Was it

27:13.801 --> 27:18.207
highly respected?

27:19.068 --> 27:21.291
Was there even a student body president then? 
There was a student body president, and he carried

27:21.371 --> 27:25.717
a great deal of prestige. Of course, the other 
person was commander of the Corps. What about Head

27:31.805 --> 27:32.806
Yellator? The Yellators themselves were 
well-known, and I I suspect admired. They were all

27:42.029 --> 27:48.541
basically elected to the particular positions.

27:48.581 --> 27:53.370
Senior class president, was that a highly sought 
position? That was, I didn't seek it, but nor did I

27:59.178 --> 28:01.822
seek any class offers as far as... But I mean, in the 
hierarchy on the campus, was that... Yes, it was.

28:09.574 --> 28:23.515
It was one of the people that you began to remember, 
and as a result, a lot of these people who were

28:09.574 --> 28:23.515
leadership did become leaders after graduation, 
and you heard about them, both in the community and

28:09.574 --> 28:23.515
away. So you got here as World War II is beginning. 
Let's try to think about the effect of the war. When

28:36.126 --> 28:44.956
did you first realize that that war that started 
September 1, 1939 might have an effect on your

28:36.126 --> 28:44.956
life? Probably at the very beginning. Because we 
all knew that the United States was going to get in

28:47.679 --> 28:51.763
it. And I think when they passed the Selective 
Service Act is when you begin to realize that the

28:52.334 --> 29:08.668
best thing to do is to stay in Texas A&M and become 
part of the military there if you possibly could.

29:08.749 --> 29:15.334
Did you and your buddies talk about the war much in 
your ordinary conversations? No, we didn't,

29:16.035 --> 29:19.458
actually. It was sort of a distant kind of thing. 
course on December 5th in 1941. Where were you when

29:26.361 --> 29:28.163
you heard that news? I had just come back from a 
field trip out in the area for an agronomy soils

29:30.546 --> 29:39.736
course. And as we drove up, there was a bunch of us in 
the back end of a truck, an open truck. The campus

29:48.525 --> 29:51.248
was going wild at that particular point. They 
shouted the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor.

29:55.547 --> 29:58.210
That was the first we heard about it. Did you know 
where Pearl Harbor was? Yes. Oh, you did? Okay. I

30:03.157 --> 30:06.481
was a sixth grader, and I didn't know. Our teacher 
had to tell us. We knew where Hawaii was, but we

30:09.405 --> 30:12.569
didn't know about Pearl Harbor. Did you and your 
buddies listen on Monday, December 8th? We were in

30:19.238 --> 30:21.201
the Dono, yes. To the Roosevelt speech? We were 
listening to the Roosevelt speech and the

30:22.739 --> 30:27.747
missiles.

30:27.767 --> 30:32.295
What changes were there on campus soon after the 
war started?

30:35.580 --> 30:43.813
Well, you suddenly, you knew where you were going 
to be, and this was December 41, and it became to me,

30:44.165 --> 30:53.816
imperative to get that contract in order to stay in 
the military and not be pulled in as a... As a

30:44.165 --> 30:53.816
draftee? As a draftee.

30:57.741 --> 31:07.352
I don't think there was as much change in the campus 
as that, except that the planning began to change

30:57.741 --> 31:07.352
where we were going to go to school straight 
through. We no longer had a... The summer was going

31:10.236 --> 31:12.298
to disappear. The 1943 class year started in June. 
So that you started 12 months a year. We started 12

31:21.780 --> 31:23.142
months a year. And did the semester length change? 
Was it still September through the end of January,

31:29.131 --> 31:33.317
January through the end of May? It was through the 
end of January. Okay. Probably, no, the semester

31:36.942 --> 31:40.227
length did not change. Okay. Nor did it 
juxtaposition. So you just...
