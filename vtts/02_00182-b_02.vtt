WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:04.572
chila coffee. So we had corn plots tests growing at 
all these locations and we'd send them the seed to

00:04.632 --> 00:23.115
plant and then go around in the fall and take notes 
on the crop and evaluate the hybrids so that we had

00:04.632 --> 00:23.115
different hybrids for different environmental 
areas. And the one thing that has always been a

00:23.656 --> 00:30.865
tremendous importance to me and a value is the 
contacts I had with the superintendents at these

00:31.317 --> 00:35.583
different stations. They were really a 
tremendous group of people, diverse as could be,

00:36.064 --> 00:50.846
but everyone was likable, and they were effective 
people and committed to their work, and they just

00:36.064 --> 00:50.846
loved what they were doing. I've mentioned a few 
names. There was Bill Friend at Wesley Cole. I

00:57.135 --> 00:58.357
can't remember all the initials. Hall at 
Beeville, Stansel at Angleton, Henry Hill at

01:01.152 --> 01:20.410
Temple, Johnson at Tyler, Shorty Morris at 
Nacogdoches, Roy Quimby, who you've probably

01:01.152 --> 01:20.410
heard of, at Chillicothe, and a fellow named Don 
Jones out at Lubbock. I think these people

01:20.430 --> 01:29.539
deserve, these leaders in the different areas 
deserve a tremendous amount of credit for what

01:20.430 --> 01:29.539
they've done. efforts like the corn project, did 
they have plots at many of the stations using the

01:30.194 --> 01:43.795
new, hopefully the new varieties of corn? That's 
correct, yes. We would carry out what we'd call a

01:45.257 --> 01:49.083
breeding function. We'd develop the lines and 
make the experimental crosses and then send a

01:49.564 --> 01:56.995
series of crosses to each of these locations. And 
then they'd harvest the plots in the fall. And we'd

02:01.194 --> 02:08.421
go around there and take notes on them, make 
observations, and make selections of the best

02:01.194 --> 02:08.421
hybrids. So they played an integral role in, in 
this case, the development of hybrid corn. But of

02:14.667 --> 02:20.072
course, they were carrying on other activities 
that related to their particular area. For

02:20.092 --> 02:25.497
example, in the valley, they'd be working with 
vegetables and fruits a lot.

02:31.265 --> 02:33.709
on this particular project. When did y'all begin 
to think that you were making some progress? How

02:38.095 --> 02:40.779
many years did it take? Well, I'd say that Dr. 
Mangelsdorf started in the development in the

02:40.799 --> 02:46.648
early 30s. And we were beginning to have the first 
few hybrids introduced in 41, 42, and

02:47.389 --> 02:58.926
just improved from then on. We introduced, oh, I'd 
say half a dozen hybrids during the early war

02:59.513 --> 03:10.988
years, and I was gone during 45 and back in 46. And we 
then had additional and improved, I'd say a second

03:11.269 --> 03:23.485
group of hybrids came along in the late 40s as a 
result of this joint program all around the state.

03:25.047 --> 03:25.588
So it was a... an interesting time in this 
particular project area. What was your response

03:30.959 --> 03:39.009
as a typical Texas farmer to these new varieties? 
They were generally eager to accept them, yes. We

03:42.394 --> 03:50.225
were obtaining yield increases of I'd say 15 to 30 
percent. Of course, one of the reactions, they

03:50.245 --> 03:55.812
didn't like to pay the higher price for the seed. 
which they'd been accustomed to harvesting their

03:56.281 --> 04:03.388
crop and just replanting, usually, and having a 
seed cost. I've forgotten now what the cost is, but

04:03.829 --> 04:10.876
you end up costing a few dollars an acre for the 
hybrid seed. In that era, Texas corn was usually

04:11.637 --> 04:18.404
fed to the animals locally? A lot of it was, yes. 
Just over a period of time, changed somewhat from

04:24.547 --> 04:37.946
being used on the farm where it was grown to being 
collected in elevators and maybe fed locally by

04:24.547 --> 04:37.946
feeders locally. And by now, I'd say some of it goes 
clear up to the feedlots. And what also happened

04:45.116 --> 04:52.647
over a period of time, and this gets on up into the 
50s and 60s, the corn acres declined dramatically

04:53.217 --> 04:59.365
But the yield went up so that today we have, instead 
of five million acres, we have two million. But the

04:59.385 --> 05:02.029
average yield is over 100 bushels an acre. So we're 
actually, I figured this out, producing more corn

05:02.049 --> 05:07.416
probably than we did in 1940. And you

05:07.436 --> 05:14.004
said 15 bushels maybe with the old corn? The 
average yield per acre. 15 to 100. Yes, that's

05:17.821 --> 05:20.124
correct. It's a little over 100, very little, 110 
or so, but we'd be producing more now on the 2

05:20.185 --> 05:47.085
million acres by quite a bit than we were on the 5 
million in 1940, and that's just an indication of

05:20.185 --> 05:47.085
one improvement in agriculture and what's 
happened overall with the improvement in seeds,

05:20.185 --> 05:47.085
fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides and all 
that. You're a full-time member of the Experiment

05:47.335 --> 05:54.421
Station staff, working full-time on the corn 
project. Correct. Up to the war. Then you go away,

05:57.324 --> 05:59.866
active duty. I was gone just during 1945. Then you 
come back. Take the story from there and go

06:05.271 --> 06:07.032
forward. All right. I came back, started back at 
the Experiment Station beginning in 1946. And...

06:17.727 --> 06:21.931
I went off to graduate school in summer of 46. I 
wanted to get a Ph.D. degree if I wanted to stay in

06:21.951 --> 06:40.851
this type of work because, as you're familiar 
with, you're somewhat restricted in advancement

06:21.951 --> 06:40.851
without a Ph.D. degree in an institution like A&M 
or any of the other major institutions. So I went to

06:40.871 --> 06:47.278
school again with Dr. Manglethorpe, who was at 
Harvard. and finally finished. I stayed up there

06:49.750 --> 07:06.660
about a year and a half taking courses and did some 
thesis work back here in Texas, 48 and 49, and

06:49.750 --> 07:06.660
finally obtained a Ph.D. degree in 1949 from 
Harvard. You were probably a rarity at A&M then.

07:10.487 --> 07:11.629
There probably weren't many Harvard students 
here. I really don't know. I never thought to

07:14.042 --> 07:16.965
explore that. Did you retain during those 
graduate study days, did you retain your

07:17.285 --> 07:25.213
position? Yes, I was on leave and was able to go 
through a general education board fellowship. I

07:32.581 --> 07:40.249
don't know whether you've run across those 
anywhere else or not, but it's a tremendous

07:32.581 --> 07:40.249
program, the Rockefeller Foundation. When you 
come back, how did your routine change? Well,

07:47.485 --> 08:03.225
there's one story that I guess I would say is a 
highlight of my career, if you want to call it that,

07:47.485 --> 08:03.225
or corn improvement generally in relation to the 
production of hybrid corn. In 1944,

08:04.206 --> 08:09.713
before I went away into service shortly before. I 
noticed a plant that was what we call male sterile.

08:19.448 --> 08:25.774
The silks represent the female part and the 
tassels the male part. And the tassel was sterile.

08:28.157 --> 08:33.262
It had branches but didn't exude any anthrax or 
anything. And I'd remembered talking to Dr.

08:33.282 --> 08:38.367
Mangerthorff about sterile tassels. back some 
years before when he was still here. And he had

08:42.487 --> 08:51.860
talked about the possibility of using such a corn 
to produce hybrid corn without detasseling.

08:53.843 --> 09:08.623
Don't want to go into detail, but to produce hybrid 
corn, you have to detassel one parent and let the

08:53.843 --> 09:08.623
other one shed pollen to produce the hybrid, which 
is a timely and time-consuming and costly

08:53.843 --> 09:08.623
operation.

09:09.076 --> 09:14.184
Anything to be done to alleviate that would be a big 
improvement. Well, we found this one plant in the

09:14.204 --> 09:35.539
greenhouse and made some crosses with it and kind 
of lost track of it while I was in the service, but I

09:14.204 --> 09:35.539
returned and started back making continued 
crosses with it and the plants retained their

09:14.204 --> 09:35.539
sterility, which meant that it was 
cytoplasmically or maternally inherited.

09:42.778 --> 09:53.647
The male sterile character was transmitted by the 
seed parent each time and stayed sterile.

09:53.667 --> 10:05.998
In 19, after I came back from service, I guess it was 
right before I went to graduate school, in making

09:53.667 --> 10:05.998
some crosses with this sterile corn, male sterile 
corn, crossed with some different lines,

10:06.974 --> 10:19.789
different inbreds, and one of them showed up 
fertile, which meant that here was a line that was

10:06.974 --> 10:19.789
capable of restoring fertility to this sterile 
form. This is a fantastic

10:21.191 --> 10:29.240
situation if it would really work out, and it did. I 
don't know the time span exactly, but... When I got

10:34.582 --> 10:52.811
back from Harvard, we pursued it pretty rapidly 
and built up the quantities of the sterile corn in

10:34.582 --> 10:52.811
appropriate lines so that it could be used as a seed 
parent for producing hybrids and you wouldn't

10:34.582 --> 10:52.811
have to detassel it. It wouldn't shed any power. 
But you had to use then the restore lines and the

11:00.181 --> 11:07.309
pollinator so that you'd restore fertility for 
the next generation so the farmer wouldn't have a

11:00.181 --> 11:07.309
crop of cobs. There was a kind of an interim

11:09.312 --> 11:15.038
solution to this, too, though. For a while, some of 
the companies were producing, say, two-thirds of

11:16.540 --> 11:27.893
their crop on sterile and a third on the tasseled 
corn, which would be fertile, and then blending

11:16.540 --> 11:27.893
the two so that you'd get enough pollen in the 
farmer's field to produce seed, produce grain.

11:34.576 --> 11:39.422
But if you got the restorers in there, you didn't 
have to do any blending either. And I don't

11:39.442 --> 11:40.503
remember. This

11:40.543 --> 11:51.477
development really exploded once it got out into 
the industry because it was such a fantastic

11:40.543 --> 11:51.477
saving. And along there in the late 40s, early 50s 
was I don't know what the proportions were, but a

11:57.050 --> 12:05.986
tremendous amount of seed acreage planted 
through this sterile restore system. It really

12:06.006 --> 12:10.214
had a dramatic effect on the industry. In the 
success of this long program, are there any

12:10.234 --> 12:18.990
individuals that deserve special credit?

12:24.134 --> 12:27.618
the people that gave Project Wheel support? Any 
governors or members of the legislature, A&M

12:27.638 --> 12:33.625
administrators? Well, of course, the Experiment 
Station administrators.

12:40.453 --> 12:45.539
And Tom Harrington, I believe, was president or 
chancellor along in there. And there's a write-up

12:46.520 --> 12:50.024
in one of the annual reports. I don't remember why 
Tom was here. There's

12:54.256 --> 12:59.663
another element of the story here. But yes, I'd say 
there was support in the institution for it. And

13:07.253 --> 13:11.959
yes, the Department of Agriculture was 
supporting part of the research. And they were

13:11.979 --> 13:18.428
quite excited about the development, and 
particularly the director of the experimental

13:11.979 --> 13:18.428
state. He was R.D. Lewis. Did you know him? Yeah. He 
was very supportive of it and was, of course, able

13:22.317 --> 13:28.264
to see that it went ahead.

13:31.509 --> 13:35.514
Let me just finish this male sterile story while 
I'm on it. It goes ahead time-wise. So during the

13:39.239 --> 13:46.288
50s, the industry just moved to this sterile 
restore system of production. And you asked about

13:47.790 --> 13:50.453
the credit. that somewhere in the 50s, I believe it 
was the mid-50s, a lawsuit instituted. Have you

13:59.528 --> 14:00.830
ever heard any of this? I didn't know that it was 
published at the university about it off and on in

14:01.591 --> 14:07.857
the past. A lawsuit instituted by Research 
Corporation of America. I believe that's the name

14:13.944 --> 14:15.485
of it. I don't know the Research Corporation. It's 
the Rockefeller. subsidiary

14:18.918 --> 14:24.444
or something they'd founded. And Mangelsdorf and 
Jones, I didn't tell you, Jones was a corn breeder

14:25.545 --> 14:37.758
in Connecticut at the Experiment Station in 
Connecticut. He had worked with Mangelsdorf. And

14:39.520 --> 14:45.426
they had talked about this procedure for some 
time. So they...

14:49.225 --> 14:58.035
started a lawsuit against the industry for using 
the system without paying royalties for it to

14:49.225 --> 14:58.035
them. And this hassle went on for a period of 
several years. And I gave,

15:03.400 --> 15:09.747
oh, what do you call it? Give a legal report out of 
court. I can't think of the name of it right now.

15:16.495 --> 15:19.580
Deposition.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.822
Deposition. And then we were in court a time or two. 
I think the case was tried in Chicago in the

15:27.872 --> 15:33.340
mid-60s. Well, the upshot of it was that the 
Research Corporation won. The industry was

15:39.370 --> 15:42.334
alive. responsible for making the payment to him. 
I was in some awkward condition, position, since I

15:47.301 --> 15:56.871
had done the developmental activity of it, 
actually. And Jones, and the minor folks, to some

15:56.891 --> 16:07.202
extent, thought up the idea and all this and that. 
So it was a question, I guess, of who deserved

16:07.222 --> 16:11.747
credit Anyway, they won the lawsuit, and the 
industry had to pay royalty. But they just had to

16:18.428 --> 16:28.558
pay them during the last years the patent was 
available, and they would almost run out by the

16:18.428 --> 16:28.558
time they finished the lawsuit. So the industry 
paid some money. I don't remember how much. It was a

16:33.724 --> 16:35.025
significant amount. It would have been in the 
millions of dollars, I'm sure. But then in either

16:37.848 --> 16:42.072
1970 or 1971,

16:43.115 --> 16:52.706
We had a tremendous blight take over the corn crop 
in the United States, and it was a big national

16:43.115 --> 16:52.706
story. I don't know whether you had to bed in a cave 
and run into it or not. But the corn crop was reduced

16:57.371 --> 17:12.649
by a third or two thirds of a tremendous production 
due to the blight, and the blight was related to

17:13.034 --> 17:16.218
this male sterile character. The male stericorn 
blighted and the non-male stericorn didn't. So

17:20.585 --> 17:29.517
all of a sudden, here was all this seed and 
inventory that was blight-susceptible, and of

17:20.585 --> 17:29.517
course nobody wanted to plant it. So there was a 
rapid change in the industry from the sterile form

17:29.537 --> 17:37.168
back to the normal form where you do tassels. And it 
was just all kind of hullabaloo in 71 about that.

17:42.022 --> 17:43.223
And everybody's scrambling. I was in the seed 
business then, scrambling around to get

17:43.243 --> 17:48.670
non-sterile corn. And since then, it hadn't been 
used much. There has been another form or two that

17:53.716 --> 18:02.126
are used to some extent, forms that are not 
susceptible to the blight. But anyway, the story

18:02.146 --> 18:06.531
went on from the mid-40s to the 70s. And did you stay 
with corn during all those years? Yes, primarily.

18:12.717 --> 18:25.928
Well, maybe I better go back to when I came back from 
my graduate work, finished in 1949, and then I went

18:12.717 --> 18:25.928
back, continued my job. I was just on leave and 
continued working in charge of the corn

18:25.948 --> 18:31.112
improvement program. But in 1956, I became head of 
the Department of Agronomy. and didn't really

18:36.987 --> 18:42.652
have time to do any work anymore. But I didn't last 
very long, only a couple years. I came here in 56 and

18:48.358 --> 18:50.700
resigned in 58.

19:00.369 --> 19:02.852
Describe the Department of Agronomy at that time 
in terms of its number of faculty and who were its

19:00.369 --> 19:02.852
key people and so forth. All right. Let me back up 
just a little. I think I mentioned earlier that the

19:07.312 --> 19:17.304
Experiment Station and the Agricultural 
Extension Service were separate from the College

19:07.312 --> 19:17.304
of Agriculture. And in 1946, at

19:17.324 --> 19:33.184
the recommendation of the committee that had 
studied the subject, they combined those three

19:17.324 --> 19:33.184
agencies under a chancellor of agriculture, I 
believe. It affected the department

19:33.603 --> 19:50.202
tremendously because there was a teaching 
department of agronomy, a research department of

19:33.603 --> 19:50.202
agronomy, and there wasn't literally an 
extension department of agronomy, but there were

19:33.603 --> 19:50.202
agronomists in the extension service. So these 
three branches were all put together in one

19:50.222 --> 19:58.632
department as part of the agricultural system. 
That happened in 46, 47. So when I became

20:01.194 --> 20:20.337
department head in 40, excuse me, 56, a man by the 
name of Dr. Adams had been department head from 46

20:01.194 --> 20:20.337
to 56, implementing this coordinated department 
effort. And that was pretty well established at

20:20.357 --> 20:23.561
the time. I became head in 56. I'm going to guess we 
had 30 or 40 staff members in agronomy locally

20:28.295 --> 20:36.244
here. Who were the most nationally known

20:37.065 --> 20:42.912
members? In the department? Okay.

20:48.738 --> 20:56.227
I'm more familiar with the people in the plant 
science area than I am in soil science. Agronomy

20:56.247 --> 20:57.508
covers both. and subjects. T.R. Richmond was the 
cotton leader, and he was well-known nationally.

21:08.915 --> 21:09.155
I.M. Atkins was the small grain leader, and both of 
them were well-known nationally and

21:09.316 --> 21:19.532
internationally. Now, some of the agronomists 
that weren't literally in the department here,

21:25.045 --> 21:35.219
but they were located at these substations I 
mentioned, and they could be considered, I guess,

21:25.045 --> 21:35.219
agronomists. They were part of the system anyway. 
Hank Beechel, whom you may have heard of as a rice

21:38.644 --> 21:51.102
breeder at Beaumont, and he became world, he's a 
Borlaug type now. World-renowned rice breeder,

21:51.122 --> 21:54.867
and spent some years in the Philippines, He did 
some part of the Green Revolution work. He's 93

22:00.095 --> 22:07.283
years old now, I think, and still gets out in the 
fields and lives down here at Alvin, I believe.

22:07.303 --> 22:09.546
Atkins, as you say, was the wheat breeder. But J.R. 
Quindy, who you've heard of, I think, he's gotten

22:09.947 --> 22:17.396
several awards around the state. The nation was 
internationally known as the Sardine Authority.

22:22.927 --> 22:26.133
A man named Kenny Porter was also in small grains. 
He was located out of Amarillo at the experiment

22:26.835 --> 22:32.627
station there. And in the soils program, probably 
J.D. Page was widely known. Do you know him? He was a

22:42.366 --> 22:44.310
soil physicist. Adams

22:46.130 --> 22:53.841
himself was head during the 50s. There was 
well-known soil fertility work.

23:00.711 --> 23:06.920
A couple of fellows, Fisher and Caldwell in soil 
chemistry.

23:08.182 --> 23:14.972
Frank Fudge was a soil chemist who had been 
stationed for a number of years in the department.

23:15.627 --> 23:23.914
During that era, was almost all of the research 
funding from appropriated state and federal

23:15.627 --> 23:23.914
money? Was there much private money supporting 
research? No, there was not much private money.

23:31.520 --> 23:40.648
And I don't know just what the balance would be 
between state and federal, but there was a lot of

23:31.520 --> 23:40.648
federal money in supporting programs. The 
Bankhead Jones Act provided funds. I've

23:46.593 --> 23:49.377
forgotten the name of the other one. And annually, 
we'd have inspectors come down from the US

23:49.497 --> 24:00.994
Department of Agriculture and review the 
projects and make recommendations. But there was

24:01.014 --> 24:04.580
very little private money. In the corn project, we 
did have some industry funding.

24:13.893 --> 24:16.397
The industry itself provided. certain funding on 
a percentage basis on sales and marketing of

24:16.867 --> 24:26.824
hybrid corn. It was, oh, at that time, 
substantial. About $50,000, $100,000 annually.

24:35.058 --> 24:39.425
When you became department head, who was the dean? 
Whom did you report as department head? That was

24:41.926 --> 24:50.533
the first thing President Rutter asked me when I 
resigned, who I reported to, and I never was quite

24:41.926 --> 24:50.533
sure. The administration of the land-grant 
system is complex

24:52.375 --> 25:02.384
and even questionable, I could say. Anyway, the 
department heads had three bosses, the director

25:03.365 --> 25:11.832
of extension, Director of the Experiment 
Station, and the Dean of the College of

25:12.217 --> 25:18.588
Agriculture.

25:20.150 --> 25:24.417
John Hutchinson was Director of the Extension 
Service. Artie Lewis was Director of the

25:24.437 --> 25:27.743
Experiment Station. No, not

25:30.027 --> 25:37.279
just yet. I'm trying to sort out the dean 
situation. Dean

25:43.681 --> 26:00.949
Shepardson was dean of agriculture, the teaching 
part during the 50s, and he was appointed to the

25:43.681 --> 26:00.949
Federal Reserve Board, I believe, and left. Dr. 
Adams, who was head of agronomy, became dean of

26:04.478 --> 26:14.110
agriculture, and he didn't stay but a year or two, 
and his fruit basket turned over there for a few

26:04.478 --> 26:14.110
years. He went off to Nevada, and I believe Jack 
Miller became dean after that, and he'd already

26:14.571 --> 26:24.664
gotten there because he left for Oregon.

26:37.030 --> 26:42.418
I

26:37.030 --> 26:42.418
didn't mean that as a total answer.

26:46.944 --> 27:02.326
Well, John Hutcherson,

26:46.944 --> 27:02.326
well, I shouldn't say he was one of the good old 
boys, exactly, but you just dealt with him like you

26:46.944 --> 27:02.326
would the fellow next door or anything. He 
encouraged you and supported you. I'd say took a

27:07.034 --> 27:17.166
positive outlook on the projects, activities, 
and tried to lead by example. Of course, I knew him

27:18.367 --> 27:21.331
personally pretty well. But I think he followed 
that general procedure with the individuals who

27:23.153 --> 27:28.919
reported to him. And I would judge he's a very 
successful administrator. He stayed in that job.

27:35.654 --> 27:36.655
for 20 years.

27:40.601 --> 27:45.087
Dr. Lewis was not so much that way. He was

27:45.107 --> 27:55.101
demanding in some ways.

27:55.121 --> 28:03.012
But he would recognize

27:55.121 --> 28:03.012
merit in activities and was I'd certainly say 
personally, very supportive. We just went about

28:07.262 --> 28:10.426
it in a different way, though. At least that's my 
recollection. And for you as department head, is

28:16.254 --> 28:21.862
it difficult to report to three different places? 
Well, administratively, it's somewhat

28:24.385 --> 28:28.832
confusing, yes. Oh, I was going to tell you about 
President Ruggs. I was just in this job two years.

28:34.075 --> 28:39.081
And I think Jack Miller was the dean I remember. He 
left about the same time I did.

28:46.669 --> 28:51.014
But we had a vice chancellor of agriculture also in 
the picture. And that was D.W. Williams at that

28:52.856 --> 28:56.040
time. And he was the one who called me up and offered 
me the job. not these other people. So you just

29:07.847 --> 29:11.770
missed an echelon there. So when I resigned, I 
wrote him a letter. He hired me. I'm sure I sent

29:18.296 --> 29:23.881
copies to the deans and directors. But I got a phone 
call the next day from Rudder and said, I want you to

29:23.901 --> 29:31.007
come over to my office. I don't think I'd met him. He 
had just started, I believe, maybe just a few

29:34.454 --> 29:47.093
months, as a president, a few months before, said, 
what did you write the chancellor for to resign?

29:47.633 --> 29:48.855
Why didn't you write to the dean? You report to the 
dean. Well, Mr. President, whatever I called him,

29:51.760 --> 30:04.258
he was the fellow who hired me, and so I thought it 
was appropriate to send him a letter about my

29:51.760 --> 30:04.258
employment or anything to resign. And I bet he 
talked to me 10 or 15 minutes or maybe 30, a good

30:04.745 --> 30:14.017
while for a president to spend time with, I 
thought. And I think it had some effect on some of

30:14.037 --> 30:31.579
his thinking later, maybe, because they did some 
things, I think, to kind of straighten the

30:14.037 --> 30:31.579
administration out so that at least they all were 
on the same page.

30:33.095 --> 30:41.866
I surely got the impression he felt like the dean 
was the one that he should report to.

30:47.994 --> 30:48.935
No, I resigned. I went in the industry.

30:54.743 --> 30:55.564
Right. As you look back on your career at A&M and 
your students there this year,

31:06.052 --> 31:15.066
What

31:06.052 --> 31:15.066
did being an Aggie mean? What did it mean to you in 
your life when you

31:15.086 --> 31:27.385
came up here and studied and so forth? Well, there 
is to me, I think I've talked earlier about the core

31:31.027 --> 31:42.430
involvement and not to the extent that I think it 
had an effect on me, but I value greatly the core

31:31.027 --> 31:42.430
experience, even though it was just for the two 
years. Living under those conditions and the

31:44.314 --> 31:48.563
associations you develop.
