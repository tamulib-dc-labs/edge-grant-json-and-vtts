00:03.507 --> 00:12.742
In your duties, what was the line of demarcation between the student activities for which you were responsible and the MSC activities for which Wayne?

00:12.922 --> 00:16.768
That was kind of tough and very sensitive because Wayne didn't like it at all.

00:17.008 --> 00:17.890
He was unhappy.

00:18.371 --> 00:26.764
In fact, he told John Colvis that I was too young and I wasn't ready, which I always appreciated.

00:26.744 --> 00:34.038
I always looked at the demarcation as if the group is classified as an MSC committee, it goes to them.

00:34.058 --> 00:37.886
And they had the responsibility with their advisors to do all of that.

00:39.649 --> 00:46.322
And it was my business to stay out of and to try to keep my organizations out of what we called all campus programming.

00:46.842 --> 00:50.587
meaning big name things, with a few exceptions that were already established.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.112
Some of those exceptions were in student government.

00:54.332 --> 01:01.422
I mean, they already had a Mother's Day going, which came from the Corps through Civilian Student Council and so forth.

01:01.442 --> 01:08.091
And they had some big things going that, and I felt like there was that, and also if the MSC wasn't doing it,

01:08.071 --> 01:15.763
that there was then the possibility that my groups could get in and do that, which some of them have come along.

01:15.783 --> 01:17.425
So that was the big demarcation.

01:17.445 --> 01:29.303
And then also, the MSC was doing a big all-university calendar, and I asked John if I could bring that with me because the calendar needed to stay an all-university thing and not be just an MSC calendar.

01:29.283 --> 01:35.952
So we brought that with us and immediately began to put together a student handbook, which we never, we found it.

01:35.972 --> 01:39.297
It was over, Lane Stevenson was doing it, over in that operation.

01:41.480 --> 01:46.587
So the programming was sort of defined by whether it was an all-campus program.

01:46.607 --> 01:52.996
In other words, I would never let MSC get into putting, bringing big-name entertainment in, which Fred McClure wanted to do one time.

01:53.056 --> 01:56.060
He wanted to have a big carnival, and I said, that's MSC stuff.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.602
We need to stay out of their business.

01:57.582 --> 02:04.640
But Mother's Day developed into Parents' Day, which developed into Parents' Weekend, which is one of the biggest programs we have.

02:05.783 --> 02:09.212
The student Y was already doing Fish Camp.

02:09.854 --> 02:14.325
And incidentally, the first time that I worked with Fish Camp, they had one camp with 300 freshmen.

02:14.862 --> 02:44.008
and so that thing just grew and grew and grew and it is kind of an all-university program but it's for freshmen and the student Y kept it for a long time and then it then the fish camp element broke away from fish camp from student Y and became their own program and grew to be six camps with seven camps with with over 4,000 freshmen uh huge program growth there there were some other things that and there were some other things created that I felt were appropriate

02:44.326 --> 03:11.734
to do like um like the big event was started by student government as a as a one-day community activity and that has turned into a huge program and to me it wasn't fair to say okay we have this big university program that student government has perfected now let's take it over the msc so we sort of had things like that that we we agreed to and part of the reason that this works so well is that coldest was really um

03:11.714 --> 03:40.843
a master at making us work together as a team and so there were no surprises that we were going to do big event you know it was like we started talking about this when i found out that student government wanted to create it and what it was so i would come to staff meeting and i would say student government has a new idea for a program that they're gonna they've already got half planned and it is so there were no surprises that when it became six thousand students going out to do something community it it grew along

03:40.823 --> 03:45.109
You know, the information about it grew along with the program.

03:46.071 --> 03:56.746
In those early years with Williams, do you remember anything y'all proposed that got turned down somewhere?

03:58.048 --> 03:59.290
Not that we proposed.

03:59.390 --> 04:03.456
Was he an encourager of the growth of student activities?

04:04.178 --> 04:07.002
Once he got Colas on board, I never heard from him again.

04:07.223 --> 04:09.627
I mean, except for the little thank you notes.

04:09.867 --> 04:15.135
As far as you're aware, he was a delegator to Colas.

04:15.276 --> 04:15.856
Absolutely.

04:15.876 --> 04:24.310
All he did was say, tell me when you want me to be there and make sure that there's a seat for me or, you know, that it's properly done.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.952
And that's all that I really remember.

04:25.992 --> 04:27.655
He was wonderful about coming to things.

04:27.635 --> 04:49.812
how skillful was williams before speaking to a crowd of students and our parents oh he was excellent he just charmed the barnacles off of everybody he was just great very short to the point very down to earth i think that's why people like him so much and always with a smile of his own and creating a smile out there he was a master at speaking

04:50.872 --> 04:52.334
two different audiences.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.459
You know, he was great speaking to students.

04:55.499 --> 05:01.929
He wouldn't have said the same things to students as he said to parents, as he said to faculty, as he said to alumni, you know.

05:01.949 --> 05:10.922
One of the things that I'll add at this point that I didn't realize at that point, and I don't think many of my faculty colleagues did, was that his experiences

05:11.830 --> 05:22.802
from a beginning faculty member teaching Southern history at Clemson College it was then, until he left there as the chief academic officer to come to Texas.

05:23.947 --> 05:28.555
was almost exactly identical to the experiences A&M had during the same years.

05:29.416 --> 05:33.102
They coeducated and made the core non-compulsory a little before we did.

05:33.343 --> 05:41.617
And the Clemson student body and families are quite similar to the A&M student body and families.

05:42.598 --> 05:47.727
And another example is they're off, Clemson is off the main highway,

05:47.960 --> 05:50.126
about 100 miles from the state capitol.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.128
Okay, okay.

05:51.148 --> 05:53.033
Where the state university is located.

05:53.073 --> 05:53.896
Right, right.

05:54.156 --> 05:58.628
And the University of South Carolina people tell Clemson jokes.

05:59.367 --> 06:05.898
Well, did Williams implement co-education at Clemson or was it done before he got there?

06:05.918 --> 06:08.663
No, he is there when it does happen.

06:08.703 --> 06:12.870
Okay, because, you know, I thought he was, I don't think he could have ever done that here.

06:13.471 --> 06:17.057
I think Rudder was the only person in the world that could have done that.

06:17.197 --> 06:22.766
But having it done, then Jack Williams was the perfect person to come in and say, okay, we're done that with that.

06:22.826 --> 06:24.970
Now we're going on to academic endeavors.

06:24.950 --> 06:27.755
And by the way, we got a lot of stuff that needs to be done for students.

06:28.196 --> 06:30.720
I don't know whether he understood.

06:30.760 --> 06:41.018
I mean, of course, I come from this and I'm biased, but I don't know if he understood how important it was to put in the Division of Student Services here when he did.

06:40.998 --> 06:53.616
Because to me, we had moved into an age where students could find great academics almost anywhere, not almost anywhere, but at wherever they looked and wanted, they could find great academics.

06:53.636 --> 07:03.150
But to find those experiences that mended, melded so beautiful with those, I mean, it wasn't like I have to go here or I want to go there.

07:03.610 --> 07:06.094
It's like I'm going to go to a place that has both.

07:06.361 --> 07:15.394
And I think that the experiences that those students had had up to that point and then after that, they went back and they said, man, you know, we got it all at A&M.

07:16.175 --> 07:25.689
And to me, that's how students, 99% of them, chose to play where they wanted to go anywhere, was where they heard good things from other people about that school.

07:25.709 --> 07:35.203
In those early years for you in this new task, who were some of the key student leaders that you remember with joy and pride?

07:35.183 --> 07:36.597
in your earliest years?

07:37.062 --> 07:39.203
Oh, goodness.

07:41.714 --> 07:51.805
Um, there was a young man by the name of, of Darbyshire, Dick Darbyshire, Dan, excuse me, Dan Darbyshire, who was one of the SCONA chairs.

07:52.165 --> 07:54.267
Chet Edwards was one of my princes.

07:55.249 --> 08:00.494
Um, uh, I would say that Fred McClure was in the second heap of them.

08:00.614 --> 08:05.139
After I became director of student activities, I'm trying to remember people that preceded him.

08:06.661 --> 08:06.861
Um,

08:09.288 --> 08:12.715
Harry Lesser was another SCONA chair.

08:13.035 --> 08:14.578
Remember Barbara Sears?

08:14.598 --> 08:16.181
I remember Barbara Sears very well.

08:16.201 --> 08:19.187
She came back to one of the student government reunions last year.

08:19.207 --> 08:25.399
She was the first student body, she was the first female student body officer I believe, wasn't she?

08:25.419 --> 08:26.942
Yes, she was.

08:27.310 --> 08:29.092
There were quite a few of them after that.

08:29.132 --> 08:30.875
I mean, after that dam was broken.

08:31.035 --> 08:34.039
Kent Caperton was one of my stars.

08:36.322 --> 08:41.009
Brad Smith was a student body president that I was crazy about.

08:41.049 --> 08:48.559
In fact, it was him that nominated me for the Outstanding Administrator's Award.

08:52.572 --> 08:53.754
Oh, there were so many.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.619
If I had a list I could, you know, to look at, I could say yes, yes, yes.

08:58.480 --> 09:07.813
The other day, about a year ago, I guess, I walked into the College of Science dinner, and there were two of my student leaders there who are now very prosperous alums.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.698
So, you know, I'm still running into them a lot.

09:14.001 --> 09:19.609
Richard Rabel is one that I'm crazy about, and Richard is so interesting.

09:21.226 --> 09:32.756
Do you remember during those early years, do you remember any guidelines which you or anyone else established of activities to stay away from?

09:34.180 --> 09:34.982
Or are there any...

09:35.283 --> 09:39.853
Were there any proposed events or groups that somebody said, uh-uh?

09:40.494 --> 09:47.068
For example... You mean, refused to recognize or refused to have... Or... Or things they should go to or not go to.

09:47.168 --> 09:47.850
Oh, that's right.

09:48.731 --> 09:48.932
No.

09:49.333 --> 09:56.127
All right, what about... We had some, back then, we had some religious organizations that were starting to come in,

09:56.107 --> 10:00.533
And Logan was my religious person, Logan Weston.

10:00.933 --> 10:05.018
And he had some kind of a list that was put out by the National Council of Churches.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.661
And if they weren't on that list, then they shouldn't be recognized.

10:07.681 --> 10:09.444
Of course, we probably couldn't get away from that now.

10:10.325 --> 10:12.527
Well, we opened the door to a lot more groups.

10:12.808 --> 10:15.091
But for the most part, we limited to that.

10:16.933 --> 10:23.481
Shortly after I became director of student activities, the gay students came in for recognition.

10:23.461 --> 10:30.688
And they simply, well, one day they came in to pick up the form, so I had a little bit of forewarning.

10:30.708 --> 10:32.970
And about three days later, they came in to turn them in.

10:33.370 --> 10:35.892
And I called John, and I said, I need to know what to do.

10:35.932 --> 10:39.235
I know there's some legalities to this, and it's very sensitive.

10:39.275 --> 10:43.059
And so he said, simply accept the forms and don't say anything else.

10:43.259 --> 10:47.723
So we accepted their forms, as in, yes, put them on my desk.

10:47.743 --> 10:49.645
Now we will consider them for recognition.

10:50.305 --> 10:53.468
So, of course, after that, we turned them down.

10:53.448 --> 10:58.296
And we turned them down, and we turned them down, and we turned them down.

10:59.858 --> 11:02.623
You used the phrasing, turn them down.

11:03.143 --> 11:11.136
How far up the administrative ladder did that matter go, as far as you're aware?

11:11.926 --> 11:13.269
Was the president... It didn't, no.

11:13.590 --> 11:17.660
I was simply advised that I should not recognize it.

11:17.821 --> 11:20.688
As far as you know, was the president aware of the application?

11:20.848 --> 11:21.711
Oh, yes.

11:21.731 --> 11:23.655
Yes, everybody was aware of the application.

11:23.896 --> 11:26.021
And then it made the newspaper soon, didn't it?

11:26.041 --> 11:27.505
Yes, but...

11:27.485 --> 11:31.170
I felt like it was important that this organization be treated like everyone else.

11:31.390 --> 11:34.094
And so to go to my boss and say, do you want to recognize this group?

11:34.434 --> 11:35.576
Are you going to sign off on it?

11:35.596 --> 11:36.938
It was not appropriate.

11:37.298 --> 11:43.967
But I did seek advice from a lot of people and then decided that, obviously, that they should not be recognized.

11:44.147 --> 11:50.556
Did you get any phone calls, letters, hate mail or anything, one way or the other?

11:51.025 --> 11:56.315
There was a lot of stuff in the battalion, a lot of editorials that we shouldn't, we shouldn't, we shouldn't.

11:57.177 --> 12:00.843
Yeah, I got some advice letters from former students, that kind of thing.

12:01.765 --> 12:03.669
But nothing that was earth shattering.

12:03.869 --> 12:08.277
Who were the chief advocates of recognizing them?

12:08.297 --> 12:08.778
Nobody.

12:10.121 --> 12:10.722
Nobody.

12:11.107 --> 12:14.996
So only the few members, as far as you were aware.

12:15.016 --> 12:19.346
Only those that had the courage to sign their name on the line.

12:19.366 --> 12:22.233
About how many students were there, do you know?

12:22.453 --> 12:24.638
Oh, I'm thinking there were probably five or six.

12:24.979 --> 12:26.062
So it was quite small at first.

12:26.142 --> 12:28.407
It was quite small, and of course...

12:28.775 --> 12:31.078
At that time, everybody was in the closet.

12:31.199 --> 12:35.926
And so how many there were out there that really wanted to do this, I don't know.

12:37.388 --> 12:39.651
But you said anecdotes.

12:39.671 --> 12:46.020
One of the most interesting evenings I've ever spent in my life was shortly after that.

12:46.201 --> 12:48.484
Actually, it was after they kept coming back a few times.

12:49.245 --> 12:53.972
There was a student government meeting, a Senate meeting.

12:53.952 --> 13:02.525
and it was to be discussed that night, whether we should recognize or not, whether they wanted to advise to recognize or not to recognize.

13:03.246 --> 13:07.873
So I went, as I went to all the Senate meetings, and I never said a word at the Senate meeting.

13:08.133 --> 13:16.245
I felt like that was their thing to do, and only if they called on me for some information to help them make a decision did I speak.

13:16.466 --> 13:21.293
So I came and I was listening, but I knew this was going to be a whopper, and of course the battalion was there.

13:21.661 --> 13:30.094
And so they did a few other things and then they launched into business and the speaker came to me and she said, we're gonna do this and I'd like to close the meeting.

13:30.114 --> 13:30.795
Can we do that?

13:30.815 --> 13:31.937
And I said, let's do it.

13:31.957 --> 13:33.499
I don't know if we can or not, but let's do it.

13:33.700 --> 13:38.127
That meant the reporter got kicked out, which was probably the best thing we ever did.

13:38.147 --> 13:40.891
So I found out later that we couldn't have done that, but who cared?

13:41.692 --> 13:42.654
So they closed the meeting.

13:43.094 --> 13:45.899
Everybody left except just the senators and they allowed me to stay.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.204
And everybody had an opinion.

13:49.657 --> 13:58.588
And it was interesting that it was maybe two-thirds don't recognize them and one-third we ought to.

13:58.828 --> 13:59.830
Now this is the Student Senate.

13:59.850 --> 14:03.214
This was the Student Senate, which I was surprised at those stats at that time.

14:04.015 --> 14:05.377
So then the discussion started.

14:05.577 --> 14:15.690
And I mean it went on and on, lots of repetitive, lots of religious stuff, lots of free world, you know, freedom of everything.

14:16.130 --> 14:17.672
It went on and on.

14:17.652 --> 14:19.555
I saw people changing sides.

14:20.136 --> 14:21.578
I mean, it was marvelous.

14:21.598 --> 14:24.342
It was one of the most educational discussions I've ever seen.

14:24.362 --> 14:26.344
People changing sides, one to the other.

14:26.445 --> 14:28.327
People saying, we need to leave politics out of this.

14:28.347 --> 14:30.390
We need to leave religion out of this.

14:31.832 --> 14:33.595
Then it came to a vote.

14:33.755 --> 14:35.538
Finally, they call question voting.

14:36.279 --> 14:42.348
It was 50-50, split right down the middle.

14:42.368 --> 14:47.575
And so the speaker, who was a female at that time, Diane

14:48.061 --> 14:49.122
I'll think of her name in a minute.

14:49.142 --> 14:50.483
She was great.

14:50.503 --> 14:53.486
She broke the tie and voted for recognition.

14:54.487 --> 14:56.349
The bill went to the student body president.

14:56.369 --> 14:57.110
He vetoed it.

14:58.811 --> 15:01.334
So that's how close and how far along.

15:01.554 --> 15:03.195
Do you have any idea when this was?

15:04.837 --> 15:07.179
No.

15:07.980 --> 15:09.882
It was after we moved to the pavilion.

15:11.063 --> 15:13.125
It was probably 80.

15:13.165 --> 15:17.629
No, 84, 85 maybe.

15:18.082 --> 15:27.732
Now, am I not correct that one of the institutions A&M was watching in this was the University of Missouri?

15:27.752 --> 15:27.992
Yes.

15:28.673 --> 15:30.475
Which had had... Had just been through all that.

15:30.555 --> 15:31.216
That's what I thought.

15:31.316 --> 15:31.616
Howdy.

15:33.918 --> 15:34.299
Howdy, howdy.

15:34.319 --> 15:34.719
Oh, hi, Tom.

15:34.919 --> 15:35.600
It has arrived.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.783
I should just skip it.

15:38.804 --> 15:42.407
Talking about the... Recognition of the Gay Student Organization.

15:42.427 --> 15:46.992
Let's see, the name, what did they use, Gay and Lesbian Student, did they call it that, or do you remember?

15:48.288 --> 15:51.776
I think they started with just gay student organizations.

15:51.796 --> 15:51.936
Okay.

15:52.036 --> 15:55.504
It's changed to something else now, gay and lesbian standardization.

15:55.544 --> 16:01.136
And this, from the first request on their part until the approval went on a decade?

16:02.238 --> 16:05.385
Something like that, yeah, yeah.

16:06.108 --> 16:15.289
And we were really, I mean, I had, I again had all their forms on my desk, like almost seven to 10 years later, waiting for this Supreme Court decision.

16:15.309 --> 16:16.732
We were watching the Missouri case.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.459
We were reading whatever we could find on it.

16:19.499 --> 16:21.183
We were listening to our university attorneys.

16:21.984 --> 16:25.332
And then there was a ruling.

16:25.312 --> 16:31.385
And I remember, I think I remember talking with Coldus that day and say, what should I do?

16:31.465 --> 16:33.329
And he said, recognize him.

16:33.349 --> 16:37.137
And at that point, the Board of Regents was on board with all of this.

16:37.217 --> 16:45.835
I think they were the ones that were, they were, you know, at least in my opinion, they were the ones giving directions of don't, don't, don't.

16:45.815 --> 16:48.559
So we recognized it the next day.

16:48.579 --> 16:49.300
It was just like that.

16:49.380 --> 16:53.285
And there was absolutely not a word said about it.

16:53.605 --> 16:56.669
It was the quietest transition I've ever seen.

16:56.849 --> 17:14.252
Now, as far as you were aware, during this eight or ten year period, when the application was on hold, there was no contention by a higher administrator and or board member and or legislator and or governor.

17:15.008 --> 17:16.230
to saying approve it?

17:17.272 --> 17:18.214
Not to my knowledge.

17:18.715 --> 17:21.580
There wasn't to mine either.

17:23.143 --> 17:36.628
Do you remember the students representing the application, do you remember any of them doing anything inappropriate, any threats, any calls, any...

17:36.608 --> 17:40.293
Well, they were feeding me information about the Missouri case.

17:40.974 --> 17:49.987
But did they do anything that... No demonstrations, no hate letters, no vigils at my desk, nothing.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.051
They were very well behaved and very professional about it.

17:53.312 --> 17:55.755
And both young men and young women?

17:55.795 --> 17:58.199
Yes, yes.

17:58.940 --> 18:05.569
As the female enrollment was almost exploding in the late 60s and 70s,

18:06.123 --> 18:10.689
What change did that make in your student activities, leadership life?

18:11.991 --> 18:18.500
Well, everything was immediately filled with both sexes, everything.

18:19.361 --> 18:23.927
And women started running for places in student government.

18:24.007 --> 18:25.890
They started taking leadership positions.

18:25.950 --> 18:34.662
I mean, just immediately things really rolled into where they were very visible, very visibly involved in all kinds of things.

18:34.642 --> 18:37.927
It took a long time to get our first student body president.

18:37.967 --> 18:44.475
So there were two things that were really not, well, three things that were kind of off limits.

18:44.616 --> 18:50.624
One was Yale leader, one was, because MSC had a female president pretty quickly after that.

18:50.684 --> 18:54.269
But of course, Yale leader, student body president, and corps commander.

18:55.030 --> 19:01.158
And it wasn't until Brooke came along, so it took quite a while to get our first student body president.

19:01.479 --> 19:03.822
We had some run, we had,

19:03.987 --> 19:16.427
Back in about 83, 84, 85, we had a young woman, well, prior to that, we had a young woman who came in and put her name down for Yellier.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.934
And she filed for two hours and took her name off.

19:21.194 --> 19:26.122
So apparently the word got out and she got pressured into getting off.

19:26.683 --> 19:28.746
Did she come herself and remove it?

19:29.131 --> 19:29.872
I don't know.

19:30.313 --> 19:32.035
I was not in there.

19:32.536 --> 19:33.798
Well, you go and you file.

19:33.858 --> 19:35.361
Yes, she must have come herself through.

19:35.381 --> 19:36.482
It was the only way that could have happened.

19:37.704 --> 19:45.136
Then, about maybe seven years later, another student came in and she filed and she came to talk to me.

19:45.156 --> 19:47.359
And I strongly encouraged her to run.

19:47.339 --> 19:50.382
and she was running for all the right reasons.

19:50.402 --> 19:56.308
Her father had been a Yale leader, and she was really excited and enthusiastic, and she had that personality.

19:56.808 --> 19:59.151
So I really advised her to stay with us.

19:59.171 --> 20:01.653
I said, you're gonna meet with some controversy, but stay with it.

20:01.753 --> 20:02.874
You have nothing to lose.

20:03.635 --> 20:05.337
And so she did.

20:05.577 --> 20:08.500
She ran, her name was on the ballot, and she did not come in last.

20:08.620 --> 20:15.827
There were probably 15 or 20 names on the ballot, and she came in like fourth or fifth from the bottom, but she did run.

20:16.398 --> 20:20.423
How close has anyone, any female, come to being elected?

20:20.443 --> 20:23.206
There has not been one since that tried to run.

20:23.627 --> 20:24.568
And that was about when?

20:24.808 --> 20:25.549
I want to say mid-80s.

20:25.569 --> 20:31.216
Right, so you're saying 15 years or so there's, right.

20:31.236 --> 20:34.520
Barbara Sears was the first student body officer, I believe.

20:34.540 --> 20:38.445
Yes, she was one of the vice, one of the committee chairs at that time they had.

20:38.485 --> 20:40.428
And I think that's the mid-70s.

20:42.130 --> 20:43.992
Probably.

20:46.317 --> 20:49.681
Tom was assistant to Williams when she was a student.

20:49.981 --> 20:55.428
Kent Caperton was in, so that was early 70s.

20:55.528 --> 21:08.022
I remember Barbara Sears standing on the steps of the Cushing Library where the polls were, where the voting booths were then.

21:08.491 --> 21:22.679
She, with beautiful eyes, she had given special care, she later admitted to me, of her eye makeup that day and her hairdo, and she passed out little cards saying, please vote for Barbara Sears.

21:22.699 --> 21:30.094
She stood on the steps, and as the young men walked up to vote, she would blink her eyes and softly say, would you vote for me?

21:31.171 --> 21:37.343
Well, when I got to the University of Missouri, I discovered that her father is one of the greatest wheat geneticists the world has ever produced.

21:38.285 --> 21:39.768
I didn't know that.

21:40.109 --> 21:41.832
I know she's in genetics now.

21:41.852 --> 21:42.614
Yes, yes.

21:42.654 --> 21:44.217
I think at Michigan State.

21:44.237 --> 21:45.159
Yes, I think so.

21:46.041 --> 21:51.812
Were there other significant elected office leadership breakthroughs for women?

21:54.205 --> 21:57.308
Well, immediately they almost filled the Senate.

21:57.488 --> 21:58.910
Lots of people running for Senate.

22:00.391 --> 22:02.193
I thought the MSC was a real breakthrough.

22:02.253 --> 22:07.198
That was a big organization on campus with lots of money and lots of influence.

22:08.079 --> 22:15.126
And I want to say that Jane, I'm bad about names.

22:15.387 --> 22:18.110
She was, I believe, the first, and that was early on.

22:18.130 --> 22:21.213
That's when I was still in the first programs office.

22:21.233 --> 22:22.474
So that had to be,

22:23.737 --> 22:33.571
late 60s, she was president, so that fell pretty early, or was raised pretty early, I should say.

22:36.935 --> 22:48.732
How did, when the women began to be elected in fairly significant numbers, was there any change in the priorities of various student organizations?

22:50.011 --> 22:51.513
Not that I know of.

22:51.533 --> 23:00.622
I think that many of them joined that organization because they liked what they saw, what was going on, and then they just went into leadership positions.

23:01.183 --> 23:10.813
There were, probably in RHA, there were some changes in priority because then you had your all-female dorms and your all-male dorms, and then their priority was to get them all mixed up and that kind of thing.

23:10.893 --> 23:13.055
So that might have been some.

23:14.597 --> 23:14.877
Okay.

23:16.099 --> 23:17.019
All right.

23:17.040 --> 23:17.520
Bye.

23:18.310 --> 23:20.154
But I don't think so.

23:20.174 --> 23:23.081
I think the women liked what they saw and wanted to be a part of that.

23:24.263 --> 23:31.018
There were some things that came along that were more dominantly female like we had the women's chorus as I mentioned earlier.

23:31.499 --> 23:34.125
We had a dance group.

23:34.105 --> 23:40.856
that did more or less ballet and modern dance, which was started by women and was predominantly for women.

23:41.818 --> 23:54.139
But of course by then there was Title IX, and I was a strict enforcer of Title IX, and said that you will take anyone that applies to this organization, no matter what.

23:54.119 --> 24:06.516
So we had, we always had some that were all male or all female, but it was only because of the kind of organization they were, not because a male or female couldn't get in.

24:06.556 --> 24:12.904
They had to read, I mean, we checked that part of their constitution carefully to make sure that they were open to all students.

24:12.884 --> 24:13.846
All right.

24:14.568 --> 24:16.914
Women in the band.

24:17.135 --> 24:19.220
I know the band didn't report to you directly.

24:19.240 --> 24:19.721
Right.

24:19.741 --> 24:27.301
But can you trace from the student life area, can you trace that story some?

24:27.321 --> 24:27.822
Well...

24:28.747 --> 24:36.136
I think that the students didn't like it, just like the former students didn't like it, but they just got used to the idea.

24:36.476 --> 24:48.050
Same thing with the women in the Corps, lots of discussion in little corner hallways and meetings about, you know, this is crazy, it's not gonna work, and how they're gonna do this.

24:48.171 --> 24:50.974
But for the most part, I think it was,

24:50.954 --> 25:00.102
It wasn't serious discussion, and most of it came after the fact, like it's a done deal, so we're going to have to get with it.

25:01.363 --> 25:18.119
In my interview with Speaker Billy Clayton about his student days, after the mic was turned off, he indicated that he had opposed coeducation when it was being discussed privately, but never said so publicly.

25:18.199 --> 25:19.780
He said it was his first year in the legislature.

25:20.333 --> 25:26.420
I asked him why, and he said, I was afraid that they wouldn't have real school spirit.

25:26.440 --> 25:30.745
Then he asked me very seriously, do the women there today have Aggie spirit?

25:31.486 --> 25:35.591
And I told him that if anything, they might have more spirit than the men.

25:36.272 --> 25:40.136
He then indicated that he was a proud grandfather of three Aggie.

25:40.657 --> 25:41.237
Aggie women.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.199
Aggie women.

25:42.499 --> 25:47.725
And I have, in hindsight, have the impression

25:48.228 --> 26:00.440
that that concern was one of the worries of some of the opponents, that they were afraid the school would change drastically from what they thought it should be.

26:00.640 --> 26:07.807
Well, I think you can trace that through the military thing too, that if you weren't in the Corps, you weren't gonna have the spirit that you should have.

26:08.287 --> 26:15.374
And so naturally, all these women were not gonna be in the Corps, and then when there were women in the Corps, they're gonna take the Corps down instead of build the Corps up.

26:16.195 --> 26:17.796
I think,

26:18.367 --> 26:46.618
that the fish camp program has done more for that than anything because the new freshmen come in and they see all of these students all of them looking alike male female all of them is just as excited as the other one and they see no difference in any of this and then of course they find out that that kid over there in shorts with a little bit long hair happens to be the corps commander you know and he can be he can do all this other stuff without a uniform on

26:46.700 --> 26:50.807
And the same thing with the student body president and the same thing with the Yale leaders.

26:50.827 --> 26:56.517
Oh my gosh, we didn't know he was a Yale leader until he put his uniform and did his program up there and then suddenly, wow.

26:57.058 --> 27:10.581
So I think that they see all of these students in a very equal plane when they go to fish camp and they see so many women and so many women in leadership roles because I used to do a program

27:10.561 --> 27:21.455
I would go and take a group of student leaders with me, and it happened to be the presidents of the different groups that would come and talk about how freshmen could get involved in their groups.

27:21.475 --> 27:31.287
And so when it was time for them to speak, if Brooke was a counselor over in Camp D, she would come to my program and do her thing.

27:31.307 --> 27:35.472
Well, the kids probably didn't even know she was student body president until that program.

27:35.452 --> 27:46.965
And so it was a leveler and it was kind of a message early on that you will come to A&M, you will get into things, you will be excited, you will be happy, everybody else is.

27:46.985 --> 27:50.254
You're inferring that you think that inclusiveness

27:50.774 --> 27:56.565
is one of the keys to A&M's school spirit and reality, and I agree with you.

27:56.585 --> 27:57.827
Well, yes, certainly.

27:57.847 --> 28:11.652
And actually, at one of my professional associations, we talked about, went to a couple of programs about inclusiveness, and the statistics were that students who were involved and included and a part of something

28:11.632 --> 28:16.279
were much more likely to remain and graduate than those who weren't.

28:16.299 --> 28:19.463
And it applied to a kid that worked at McDonald's.

28:19.503 --> 28:32.923
It wasn't just the university, but a kid that had a student job or something that they were expected to be there every day, and it was a good experience, and it was fun, and you know, that that was a big factor in whether or not they remained at school.

28:33.163 --> 28:39.212
So, you create a program that has something for everybody, you're bound to catch a lot of those students.

28:39.593 --> 28:41.335
What are the...

28:41.315 --> 28:57.436
In the total experience of an A&M undergraduate, from the time of application for admission through commencement, what are the major inclusive activities that contribute most to Aggie Spirit?

28:59.559 --> 29:02.142
I think meeting students that are in their major.

29:02.678 --> 29:04.562
meeting upperclassmen in their major.

29:05.564 --> 29:11.758
I think bonding with a group of five or more students to make good friends.

29:12.599 --> 29:18.392
I think to do something that has an effect on their self-esteem,

29:18.710 --> 29:22.975
So what are the formal organized activities that contribute most?

29:23.015 --> 29:36.611
Well, I think to join an organization and to become an officer and to be looked at as a leader, to be included in some things like a president's luncheon or a committee to choose the new vice president of the university or that kind of thing.

29:36.631 --> 29:38.933
Those are really esteem-building opportunities.

29:39.474 --> 29:41.036
And there are a lot of them on campus.

29:41.076 --> 29:44.980
It's not that this happens to be for the golden 20, you know.

29:45.341 --> 29:47.383
I think you have hundreds of students doing this.

29:47.363 --> 29:52.068
But what about such activities as Fish Camp and Muster and Bonfire?

29:52.108 --> 29:54.270
Well, these are all leadership positions.

29:54.290 --> 30:06.942
And to gravitate into a leadership position, even if it's a counselor at Fish Camp, and we had 900 counselors at Fish Camp, that is a very esteem-building position.

30:06.962 --> 30:13.168
And it also gives you, suddenly you are a mentor to all these kids and you have extra responsibility.

30:13.672 --> 30:18.539
And I think that has a big impact on where you want to go.

30:19.260 --> 30:31.037
In your years of working with all these students, if we did a profile of the key student leaders, could we identify them as rural or urban, rich or poor?

30:31.237 --> 30:34.262
Could we identify them by their college major?

30:34.282 --> 30:34.482
No.

30:35.563 --> 30:36.004
No way.

30:37.566 --> 30:37.967
No way.

30:38.407 --> 30:40.911
I was always amazed.

30:42.005 --> 30:50.537
I mean, in my last year, we had one of the most outstanding kids wandering the student government and just put together a program that was incredible.

30:51.378 --> 30:52.680
And I thought, who is this kid?

30:53.040 --> 30:55.804
I'm sitting in an athletic banquet.

30:55.824 --> 31:03.635
He wins like all honors in diving for the Big 12.

31:04.236 --> 31:07.460
You know, and I'm going, I believe this.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.683
And he's like a 4.0.

31:10.591 --> 31:17.000
You know, and I think, I don't know what his major was, but they come from all directions, and it is amazing.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.422
I mean, we never discounted anything.

31:20.004 --> 31:30.358
But no, you really couldn't, and we still had incredible, I think that, of course, over the last 20 years, we attracted so many more city kids that had so many more opportunities.

31:30.658 --> 31:33.983
We attracted so many more kids whose parents were professionals.

31:33.963 --> 31:35.948
There were books in the house.

31:35.968 --> 31:37.572
There was travel that had been done.

31:38.053 --> 31:43.066
Just the cultural enrichment of our student body changed significantly.

31:43.768 --> 31:45.492
But the students...
