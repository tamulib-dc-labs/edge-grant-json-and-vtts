WEBVTT

00:01.010 --> 00:04.555
The lines are not essential. I ask you how an 
interest came in chemical engineering that led to

00:04.576 --> 00:17.035
oceanography.

00:19.018 --> 00:19.278
Okay. I was interested in chemical engineering 
even before I started the college after World War

00:19.338 --> 00:27.591
II. So I went immediately from the Navy to two years 
of science courses at Compton Junior College,

00:28.634 --> 00:47.131
then spent a semester at Fullerton Junior 
College, and then went to New Mexico A&M, where I

00:28.634 --> 00:47.131
decided to major in chemical engineering.

00:51.395 --> 00:57.460
I graduated from A&M in 1950, and this was at kind of 
a little depression in which there weren't a lot of

00:58.148 --> 01:07.798
company representatives out scouting for 
chemical engineers to go to work for their

00:58.148 --> 01:07.798
companies. The reason I had gone to New Mexico to 
begin with was because a high school friend of

01:09.801 --> 01:19.191
mine, Art Maxwell,

01:09.801 --> 01:19.191
had gone there and recommended it. Then

01:27.224 --> 01:38.201
When he left New Mexico, and he graduated a year 
earlier than I did in physics, he went to Scripps

01:27.224 --> 01:38.201
to do some graduate work. And he had told me how good 
it was. And so I decided to try to apply my chemical

01:41.126 --> 01:51.021
engineering background, combined with the 
oceans, to extracting chemicals from the sea and,

01:52.064 --> 01:57.409
in general, working with chemistry of the oceans.

02:00.391 --> 02:11.702
So I went there in 1950,

02:00.391 --> 02:11.702
spent a year taking the required courses and 
working half time. Then because Norris

02:13.623 --> 02:22.071
Rakestraw, who was chairman of the chemistry 
department at that time, required all of his

02:13.623 --> 02:22.071
chemical people to go to UCLA for a year. I went up to 
UCLA and did a year of graduate chemistry up there,

02:26.358 --> 02:38.882
then came back to Scripps, took some more courses, 
and got involved in working almost full-time. So I

02:40.064 --> 02:41.427
got diverted from getting my Ph.D. I saw that you 
had not finished your thesis but had done all the

02:43.513 --> 02:48.799
work leading to your thesis. Now were you diverted 
then working at Scripps because you were very

02:48.839 --> 02:57.188
active then in testing and chemical engineering 
at that particular time. Were you working out of

02:57.208 --> 02:58.249
Scripps? No, I was working at Scripps at the time. I 
was doing some research with Ted Folsom which

03:03.094 --> 03:10.823
involved trying to do extraction of chemical 
compounds at low temperatures out of the

03:11.967 --> 03:23.102
seawater, particularly looking at the organic 
problem. And so I built a vacuum evaporator and

03:23.122 --> 03:31.393
used it in a series of small experiments. We're in 
good shape. Now, what I don't understand is, did

03:33.692 --> 03:44.147
your time in the Navy have any effect upon your 
decision to enter oceanography or chemical

03:33.692 --> 03:44.147
engineering? I don't think so. Okay. What did you 
do while you were in the Navy? I was a machinist

03:47.712 --> 03:58.427
mate, enlisted man, spent the entire, after the 
first year of training, the entire time on an LSD in

03:47.712 --> 03:58.427
the South Pacific. It seemed to me like that would 
dampen the enthusiasm for oceanography.

04:04.899 --> 04:06.181
When did they send you to UCLA? Was that the general 
policy at Scripps at that time, to do a year study

04:06.401 --> 04:13.510
away from the institution in the hard sciences, so 
to speak? It was Raichstraw's policy, because

04:13.530 --> 04:20.079
Scripps was, there was no UCSD at that time. 
Scripps was a little campus down there all by

04:20.119 --> 04:28.009
itself, and he felt that chemical oceanographers 
should have a stronger grounding in chemistry

04:28.445 --> 04:31.308
that he could give them at Scripps. So he required 
them all to go spend a year at UCLA in the chemistry

04:31.328 --> 04:34.592
department. Who else was at Scripps while you were 
there who might have had some influence on you?

04:41.539 --> 04:43.501
Warren Wooster was there. I worked for Warren from 
the day I went there. John Isaac. I worked for Ted

04:50.408 --> 04:54.132
Folsom and John Isaac for some time. Ed Goldberg. 
Does there seem to be any lead from Scripps to

04:58.803 --> 05:02.509
O.N.R.? Yeah, Howard Maxwell.

05:07.717 --> 05:07.817
Okay. Now, what had happened was that both Art and I 
got involved in looking at the fallout of fission

05:07.837 --> 05:22.019
products from nuclear testing in the South 
Pacific. And he had...

05:26.748 --> 05:31.976
participated in, I think, the 54 series of tests. 
And he got disinterested

05:31.996 --> 05:36.783
in it. And Gordon Little came to Scripps and talked 
him into going to Washington about 1955 or

05:37.584 --> 05:45.256
something like that. Maybe it was 56, 55. 
Meanwhile, I was not working for Art at Scripps. I

05:54.510 --> 05:55.371
was working for with Folsom and Isaacs. And in the 
56 series of tests, after Art had gone, then I sort

05:58.171 --> 06:16.553
of took over the responsibility for that part of 
the testing that both he and Ted Folsom had been

05:58.171 --> 06:16.553
doing earlier in organizing and this sort of 
thing. So I stayed until 1958. And Vedder left. O&R

06:25.118 --> 06:32.166
at that time, and Maxwell asked me if I'd like to 
come and go to work for O&R. And I could see I wasn't

06:33.467 --> 06:41.976
going to get to work on my PhD, not because they 
wouldn't let me, but because of my own interests.

06:43.878 --> 06:48.683
So I decided to go join Art in Washington and work 
for O&R. Now, before we move into such things as

06:52.625 --> 06:54.127
Washington experiences. I only have a couple of 
more questions I would like to ask. What exactly

06:57.371 --> 07:04.799
sorts of tests were you running on radioactive 
fallout?

07:04.819 --> 07:20.978
Well, the key question that was being asked was how 
much of the fission products from a given bomb test

07:04.819 --> 07:20.978
go into the stratosphere and how much of it come 
down locally. They couldn't measure what went

07:22.105 --> 07:29.393
into the stratosphere, but there was some hope 
that they could measure how much of it came down as

07:22.105 --> 07:29.393
local fallout. And so we spent a lot of time 
building instruments to tow behind the ship,

07:30.253 --> 07:45.769
trying to map the aerial extent of the fallout and 
the depths to which it had penetrated, and trying

07:30.253 --> 07:45.769
to do a mass balance back to the bomb test. And so it 
was instrument development, data reduction,

07:49.257 --> 07:59.544
writing reports for Sandy on the results, and most 
of it was classified, secret. Now then, after this

07:59.564 --> 08:05.038
series of experiments then,

08:05.930 --> 08:07.132
Off you go to Washington. And exactly what 
prompted the change from academic to managerial

08:08.013 --> 08:18.529
life then seems to be a feeling you prefer not to 
finish a PhD thesis. Then when you come to work for

08:18.950 --> 08:25.379
ONR, what exactly do you do?

08:25.399 --> 08:28.584
Well, I went to work in the geophysics branch. And 
at that time, it was being run by Gordon Lill, who He

08:35.191 --> 08:38.314
was a geologist himself. And Maxwell, who was 
responsible for oceanography. And it had an

08:42.879 --> 08:56.413
atmospheric arm, Jim Hughes, and a solid earth 
geology program under, I

08:42.879 --> 08:56.413
can't think of his name now. But anyway, I 
essentially went there to help Art manage the

08:57.113 --> 09:04.641
program, their research program at the academic 
institution. And the first thing I did with Art and

09:05.330 --> 09:29.602
Gordon was to write a 10-year plan for the Navy's 
program in oceanographic research called TENOC,

09:05.330 --> 09:29.602
and that document was used by the Navy as a planning 
document for expanding oceanography in the U.S.

09:05.330 --> 09:29.602
What sort of research did you seek to aid while you 
were at O.N. Art?

09:34.321 --> 09:38.787
Were you mission-oriented or war-oriented or 
hard science-oriented? Well, in 1958, when I went

09:38.807 --> 10:00.033
there, and for the early part of the 60s, it was our 
conviction and the conviction of the people at

09:38.807 --> 10:00.033
ONR, Chief of Naval Research and others, that just 
about any research that you do on the oceans is

09:38.807 --> 10:00.033
going to help the Navy since that's the Navy's 
operating environment. So we were

10:00.694 --> 10:03.417
essentially... While we had a mission 
orientation, the composition of the research

10:04.105 --> 10:14.157
program that we supported wasn't restricted in 
any way. It was all unclassified, all basic, and

10:15.419 --> 10:21.566
not restricted to one discipline or another. It 
wasn't until Mansfield Amendment of 1966

10:23.088 --> 10:33.741
or something like that that the Navy became 
concerned about the orientation of its,

10:33.856 --> 10:39.345
particularly ONR, the orientation of its basic 
research program. But even then, we didn't, I

10:39.365 --> 10:45.676
don't think we had to lop off 5% of what we were 
supporting. It was still justifiable, highly

10:45.957 --> 10:54.852
justifiable under the Navy's banner.

10:56.907 --> 11:07.020
Did you try to create academic departments in 
academe as departments of oceanography in this

10:56.907 --> 11:07.020
period? Yes, we did. There were

11:08.042 --> 11:14.951
five institutions in 1958. Scripps, Woods Hole, 
University of Washington, Texas A&M, and Miami.

11:25.004 --> 11:28.107
And I guess Lamont was there, but we weren't 
supporting it. And what we said in Tannock was that

11:29.788 --> 11:45.982
there was not enough oceanographic capability in 
the country to satisfy the Navy's needs for basic

11:29.788 --> 11:45.982
research in this area, and that we should build 
laboratories using ONR funds. Not, yes, build

11:46.363 --> 11:50.246
them, but help the people build them. So Wayne Burt 
went to Oregon State University, and we supported

11:50.266 --> 11:54.910
him. in building up his capability,

11:55.126 --> 12:05.983
supplied him with a ship from the Navy's funds, 
supported his research program as it expanded.

12:06.985 --> 12:08.848
John Knauss went to the University of Rhode 
Island. O&R supported the buildup of his program,

12:10.310 --> 12:21.808
made available

12:10.310 --> 12:21.808
the funds to convert one of the FS class research 
vessels.

12:26.429 --> 12:35.762
We had also, in that 10-year plan, planned to 
expand the existing institutions at a rate of

12:26.429 --> 12:35.762
about 10% a year for 10 years. And we had a 
shipbuilding program to go with it. And we made

12:38.366 --> 12:46.898
ships available to Lamont, Scripps, Miami,

12:38.366 --> 12:46.898
Woods Hole. And we built some buildings. We built 
the building at the Johns Hopkins University the

12:56.129 --> 13:02.277
Chesapeake Bay Institute, primarily with ONR 
funds, under amortization. They build it, and

13:02.538 --> 13:09.207
then we let them amortize the cost over 10 years at 
8% a year, over 8 years at 10% a year. So in general,

13:09.868 --> 13:15.235
that period of time was spent in ONR's building the 
oceanographic capability. What about specific

13:15.653 --> 13:17.275
departments? Suppose that you saw you needed a 
department of chemical engineering and

13:17.957 --> 13:22.143
oceanography someplace. Would you tend to invite 
proposals of this sort to come in to encourage

13:22.163 --> 13:28.533
departmental growth? No, I wouldn't say we didn't 
do that. We may have in conversations with the

13:30.656 --> 13:38.248
laboratory directors encouraged the buildup of 
this or that or something else. But we didn't

13:38.668 --> 13:43.095
really... We tried not to... impinge too much on 
the university's prerogatives, which include

13:45.488 --> 13:51.515
building the kind of departments they want. Yeah, 
right. Did you have any ratio about which you tried

13:54.378 --> 13:57.102
to divide funds up? Did you try to work the funds out 
equally in terms of sections or in terms of

13:57.142 --> 14:06.553
universities, or primarily you organized them 
around the caliber of the proposals, or both?

14:09.356 --> 14:12.880
Well, as in most of these programs,

14:15.273 --> 14:23.764
It's partly trying to change the existing pattern 
of support and partly continuing to support what

14:15.273 --> 14:23.764
you supported last year. And so I

14:23.865 --> 14:44.132
think the way we spent our money early in the game, 
we spent our money by essentially discussing what

14:23.865 --> 14:44.132
the major institutions would be doing during the 
coming year and then supplying them with the funds

14:23.865 --> 14:44.132
without too much deep review on the individual 
projects. It was really block support to

14:46.203 --> 14:49.147
institutions. And then,

14:49.207 --> 15:09.851
that was about the time of the Mansfield Amendment 
and about the time that ONR restructured their

14:49.207 --> 15:09.851
program, got rid of the geophysics branch, 
organized an ocean sciences division, that we

14:49.207 --> 15:09.851
started doing harder and harder reviews and 
building a team of experts. Up until Up until the

15:12.496 --> 15:25.293
time that they established the Ocean Sciences 
Division, there were only two oceanographers

15:12.496 --> 15:25.293
in the geophysics branch. Artis had me as

15:26.615 --> 15:39.752
chief oceanographer, and then we hired Don

15:26.615 --> 15:39.752
Martineau and

15:45.942 --> 15:47.243
I mean, I can't tell you. My memory doesn't carry 
that well right now. All right, now, two comments

15:49.986 --> 15:53.930
have appeared in the course of other interviews. 
Some oceanographers have maintained that it was

15:55.211 --> 16:07.123
better in terms of research facilities when ONR 
simply gave block funds and allowed the

15:55.211 --> 16:07.123
university itself to distribute it, like 
Scripps. Others have argued that they now prefer

16:07.683 --> 16:14.430
it the way it is now, that it's closely looked over 
projects, with sort of careful review of

16:15.271 --> 16:17.354
proposals. Now, the people who advocate the block 
funds maintain that it was more experimental

16:18.296 --> 16:23.725
then. This was a better chance for a person without 
a national reputation to come into research

16:23.765 --> 16:29.995
funds. The others maintain that now you receive 
more money for your research. Do you have any

16:33.861 --> 16:40.392
opinion one way or another on that?

16:40.412 --> 16:41.734
Well, I suppose that

16:48.076 --> 17:01.236
Certainly the awarding of block funds to the 
institute directors gave them more flexibility

16:48.076 --> 17:01.236
in supporting the kind of research that they 
wanted to support. And in a sense, I suppose, that

17:01.857 --> 17:10.910
provided more flexibility because there were 
more people making the decisions and a broader

17:01.857 --> 17:10.910
base. I don't think the way we're doing it now

17:20.223 --> 17:20.984
is hampered. I don't think that the flexibility of 
the way we're doing it now is hampered as much by the

17:21.405 --> 17:29.516
administrative procedures as it is by funding. I 
think if the directors, who at that time were

17:30.517 --> 17:43.875
getting fair increases every year and building, 
they had a lot of spare cash to work with. I think if

17:44.856 --> 17:49.943
they were faced with what they've been faced with 
for the past four or five or 10 years maybe, they

17:50.767 --> 17:52.429
would have not been so flexible either. And so I 
don't think it's the system that cuts down the

17:54.131 --> 18:02.601
flexibility as much as it is the growth or collapse 
of the field. Now, growth of the field. Others have

18:06.525 --> 18:19.040
suggested that the plethora of institutions 
created in the late 50s, early 60s divided the

18:06.525 --> 18:19.040
research pie up to the extent that worthy projects 
are now very difficult to get funded. Would you

18:19.060 --> 18:19.761
agree?

18:26.862 --> 18:27.663
I don't know. I think from IDOE's point of view, I 
don't believe that's the case. It may be because of

18:33.632 --> 18:47.933
ONR's difficulties over the past five years, 
level funding, in the face of galloping

18:33.632 --> 18:47.933
inflation, that

18:33.632 --> 18:47.933
that's a real impact. But the establishment of 
IDOE at least made funds available for big,

18:48.394 --> 18:55.384
exciting programs to be carried out. Now, a few 
comments about these, if you shall. Roger

19:02.815 --> 19:10.984
Revelle, when did you first meet him and what sort 
of impact did he have on ONR by the time you arrived?

19:11.004 --> 19:20.615
Well, I met Roger at Scripps when I went there, but 
his impact on ONR was before 1950. In fact, I think

19:22.156 --> 19:25.320
he was either the first geophysics branch head as a 
commander in the Navy. I think that's what he was.

19:31.881 --> 19:35.385
And he essentially shaped the geophysics branch 
at that time.

19:39.490 --> 19:53.186
So I don't know what other impact he had at ONR, but 
he certainly established oceanography within

19:39.490 --> 19:53.186
the geophysics branch and left people behind who 
were sympathetic to oceanography. Yeah, Tom.

19:55.051 --> 20:03.532
Were there any oceanographers in particular who 
seemed to have a national impact on ONR at this

19:55.051 --> 20:03.532
time? That is, whose opinions were so valued that 
they perhaps swayed ONR in both giving funds or

20:03.672 --> 20:11.170
what have you? Oh, I think, as I said earlier, we 
were dealing directly with the laboratory

20:12.922 --> 20:25.095
directors and supporting them in sort of a block 
basis. And certainly the laboratory directors

20:25.115 --> 20:35.766
probably had the major impact on ONR's 
oceanography program. And I would defend that

20:35.786 --> 20:42.253
even today because our attitude then was that 
What's good for the science, oceanographic

20:43.685 --> 20:59.243
science, is good for the Navy, because the Navy 
doesn't have the wisdom to know what ought to be

20:43.685 --> 20:59.243
done in basic oceanographic research. And much of 
it didn't exist in Washington. So we worked very

21:02.306 --> 21:08.854
closely with them, and they certainly had an 
impact on the shape of the program and on the kind of

21:02.306 --> 21:08.854
work that was being supported. And that included 
Roger and Columbus Islin, Fritz Kochi,

21:13.705 --> 21:20.638
John Canone.

21:23.623 --> 21:25.347
Why NSF? Why did you decide to separate NSF and ONR, 
and why did you decide to go with NSF?

21:32.660 --> 21:34.684
I didn't understand the first part of that. 
There's evidently a decision made, and ONR

21:36.807 --> 21:47.637
participates in it, best I can tell, for NSF to grow 
and to separate from ONR. What was the basic

21:48.358 --> 21:55.664
philosophy behind the National Science 
Foundation, and why did you decide to go with NSF?

21:55.864 --> 22:04.232
Well,

21:55.864 --> 22:04.232
I don't think that ONR was involved in the decision 
to establish the National Science Foundation. I

22:06.246 --> 22:14.114
think some of the high people in ONR probably 
encouraged it to expand the base of basic

22:06.246 --> 22:14.114
research.

22:16.677 --> 22:21.062
But the foundation was really established by an 
act of Congress. And that was done long before I

22:21.402 --> 22:26.407
ever thought of joining the foundation. That was 
done, I

22:26.467 --> 22:33.915
can't tell you the exact date, but in the early 50s.

22:38.080 --> 22:45.711
And some of the

22:38.080 --> 22:45.711
people high up in ONR did come to the foundation. 
Randy Robertson is the one that comes to mind

22:45.912 --> 22:47.855
first. But a lot of other people from ONR who had 
experience in this kind of basic research

22:49.237 --> 22:53.523
administration. My decision to come to the 
foundation was

22:55.306 --> 23:06.923
really because a number of people put the arm on me. 
And these included Worth Mallon from Texas A&M,

23:09.956 --> 23:26.101
who had been working with Jerry Van Andel and John 
Ryder to hold the decade program together in its

23:09.956 --> 23:26.101
first few months until the director could be found 
for the IDOE program. And Tom Owen, who at that time

23:27.683 --> 23:36.336
had just assumed responsibility for the research 
directorate, national and international

23:37.244 --> 23:42.891
programs, and was responsible for the IDOE 
program. And I couldn't think of a good reason not

23:44.213 --> 23:47.317
to accept it. It was a promotion, and it was a 
challenge. And while I was enjoying myself

23:51.202 --> 24:01.716
tremendously at ONR, and I hated to leave, I just 
felt that I couldn't afford, I just couldn't turn

23:51.202 --> 24:01.716
it down. What sort of new direction did you try to 
bring to the foundation now that you have a new job

24:02.590 --> 24:08.399
removed from O&R? How did you visualize its role in 
the future? I didn't, you know, I was in O&R during

24:12.586 --> 24:29.813
the planning stages of IDOE and we had some minor 
input into it, although the Navy had somebody who

24:12.586 --> 24:29.813
was responsible sort of on a full-time basis for 
the planning. But I looked on it as a pork barrel,

24:30.923 --> 24:39.591
which we could tap out of the O and R to augment our 
ongoing program. And we put together some pretty

24:40.992 --> 24:50.281
big projects that we felt justify funds from this 
new source of money. But when I came over here, then

24:52.343 --> 24:58.028
my attitude changed a little bit.

24:58.683 --> 25:06.049
And I had no real preconceived notions about what 
the IDOE program should look like. And until I

25:06.069 --> 25:12.075
agreed to join it, I had not read very much about the 
background, the documents, or anything else. And

25:12.295 --> 25:27.728
I spent several months working with the troika 
that was trying to hold it together, and reading

25:12.295 --> 25:27.728
all the background documents, and trying to 
decide what the philosophy should be, what kind of

25:12.295 --> 25:27.728
projects we should support. and how we should 
implement the program. So I didn't have any bright

25:32.572 --> 25:34.674
ideas when I came over here.

25:38.217 --> 25:51.390
And I think the decision was pretty well made that 
we should reserve this new source of funds for

25:38.217 --> 25:51.390
tackling some difficult problems that we had not 
been able to tackle before. And

25:51.470 --> 25:56.415
then the problem was, which, you know, which 
research project should be undertaken, and how

25:57.796 --> 26:13.307
should we deal with the whole matter of initiating 
a project, reviewing it, managing it, the whole

25:57.796 --> 26:13.307
business. And it evolved. We made a lot of mistakes 
in the first year, so it evolved gradually over a

26:14.970 --> 26:20.040
long period of time. In the first several years, 
what sort of basic decision did you make, let's

26:20.813 --> 26:31.165
say, difference in reviewing and managing than 
you had at ONR in projects?

26:36.170 --> 26:39.073
A couple of major differences. At ONR, the 
procedure at that time, and still is for that

26:40.215 --> 26:49.605
matter, is to do a review of a proposal from an 
institution. with all of its components, maybe

26:50.817 --> 26:58.226
20, 30 tasks under one proposal, with the staff. 
That is, the staff, which was at that time about six

26:59.027 --> 27:19.170
oceanographers, to go and spend three or four days 
in an institution, talking to the people who had

26:59.027 --> 27:19.170
made the proposals, and then sitting down and 
making the decisions right there on which ones

26:59.027 --> 27:19.170
they would support, at what level, and which ones 
they would not support.

27:20.500 --> 27:32.481
When I came over here, the foundation's method was 
to use peer review, male review, and external

27:20.500 --> 27:32.481
review panels. And in a way, it

27:34.705 --> 27:44.382
gives you a broader base of advice, and you're less 
susceptible to criticism. I take it you prefer

27:46.133 --> 27:58.312
then the foundation method of reviewing 
proposals.

27:58.332 --> 28:01.116
You want to shut that off for a minute? You're 
supposed to be talking too much. Where did we leave

28:03.580 --> 28:04.802
off? I asked you, I said, I take it you prefer the way 
that the foundation now reviews proposals.

28:13.956 --> 28:14.757
Yeah, I think it's... for what we're doing i think 
it's better i think onr who has the mission

28:15.057 --> 28:36.188
orientation problem can still go ahead and run the 
program that way without you know they have good

28:15.057 --> 28:36.188
people and they support good scientists i don't 
think they have any problem for us for us it's

28:15.057 --> 28:36.188
better and uh

28:39.880 --> 28:48.055
sort of assures that the research you're doing is 
really excellent and not just the bias of one

28:39.880 --> 28:48.055
program manager or one person. Now, while at ONR 
you co-authored a pamphlet on the next 10 years of

28:50.579 --> 29:02.360
oceanography, would you hazard to say where you 
think oceanography is going to go within the next

28:50.579 --> 29:02.360
several years? What direction will it take?

29:06.172 --> 29:07.374
I've already done that twice. I

29:07.394 --> 29:34.187
guess you could surely identify the major

29:07.394 --> 29:34.187
issues that face the nation and the country over 
the next 10 or 20 years with regard to the oceans.

29:35.888 --> 29:37.770
And one of them is certainly climate. Physical 
oceanography is certainly going to pay close

29:38.391 --> 29:49.383
attention to the impact of the ocean on extended 
weather forecasting, on weather, and on climate.

29:52.947 --> 30:01.677
We're going to be concerned with the quality of the 
ocean as far as man's impact on that with his own

29:52.947 --> 30:01.677
waste products. And a lot of work is going to be done 
in marine pollution and marine pollution studies

30:03.074 --> 30:12.183
over the next five or 10 years.

30:15.326 --> 30:22.494
We will be deeply involved in our research. And the 
federal program will be equally deeply involved

30:22.594 --> 30:28.660
in the non-living resources. The petroleum, it's 
the kind of thing we're supporting, and we're only

30:29.956 --> 30:35.083
at the beginning of it. Manganese nodules, how 
they form. And in living resources, the whole

30:40.030 --> 30:57.195
problem of intelligent management of fisheries 
resources, based on the system or the ecology of

30:40.030 --> 30:57.195
the region, rather than just a given fish or a given 
species, this sort of thing.
