00:02.309 --> 00:04.698
Crammeled eggs, the equivalent of how many eggs probably?

00:04.718 --> 00:07.991
Well, I had to force myself to eat a lot.

00:08.031 --> 00:12.066
I never had been a real big eater.

00:12.890 --> 00:14.592
And I had a hard time getting my weight up.

00:14.612 --> 00:21.339
So I would eat, and then about 10 o'clock, drink a can of, what do they call that?

00:22.961 --> 00:24.082
Nutriman or something.

00:24.102 --> 00:30.508
It was a liquid, it was a supplement for people who had been sick or something that couldn't take regular food.

00:30.548 --> 00:31.930
So it was like a meal in a can.

00:32.410 --> 00:36.935
And I'd drink it in between meals to get the added calories to try to get my weight up.

00:37.356 --> 00:38.857
All right, and then lunch?

00:38.877 --> 00:41.580
And lunch was just a...

00:42.860 --> 00:46.304
See the track team just ate with the regular students most of the time.

00:46.364 --> 00:49.927
So in the early years Cibisa was family style.

00:49.947 --> 00:52.370
So you know it was all done in the first year or two.

00:52.410 --> 00:56.574
Then we went to Dunkin' and they started changing stuff up a little bit in those days.

00:56.734 --> 00:59.938
And then at night we ate late tables.

01:01.299 --> 01:02.640
Lunch was just whatever they served.

01:02.680 --> 01:06.985
It was a very plain but very adequate meal.

01:07.265 --> 01:12.090
Especially when you ate family style you had plenty to eat.

01:12.070 --> 01:30.597
and then at night it wasn't too glamorous being an athlete because we ate late tables which means we just ate an hour after everybody and the same thing and it wouldn't cook later you know so we'd get in there and get it because we didn't eat usually until maybe seven because we'd work out.

01:31.398 --> 01:33.661
Were there some favorite Aggie foods you remember?

01:37.387 --> 01:38.548
Some that you really enjoyed?

01:38.628 --> 01:39.209
I don't remember.

01:40.010 --> 01:41.773
Was there some you didn't like at all?

01:42.428 --> 01:44.972
I'm sure it was, but I don't really.

01:45.232 --> 01:49.878
What quality would you describe A&M food, noratory food?

01:49.898 --> 01:51.881
Oh, I thought it was pretty good, you know.

01:51.901 --> 01:56.668
I mean, I really thought it was better than what you would expect.

01:56.928 --> 01:59.912
And you guys, you all didn't play any games at supper?

01:59.972 --> 02:00.353
You didn't?

02:00.994 --> 02:01.635
No, no.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.337
Well, we got in a little bit.

02:03.357 --> 02:06.001
Usually it was when corps guys were near and it would be between us.

02:06.021 --> 02:08.284
I remember.

02:08.264 --> 02:16.859
One time there was always be a little mouthing because we're late tables and we're there and it's baseball players and track guys mainly would eat about the same time.

02:16.939 --> 02:22.449
So we're standing in the doorway and there's a little mouthing going on with the core guys that are overeating, you know.

02:23.812 --> 02:30.323
And so one of the upperclassmen tells a freshman to grab his guide on his flag and march right through us on the way out.

02:30.978 --> 02:43.675
Well, I'm turned around, talking, and as I turn around, the kid marches right, hits me right there, and I grabbed him as a reflex and threw him, well, the flag went flying, got on.

02:44.277 --> 02:45.139
Here they all come.

02:45.693 --> 02:46.995
Well, here comes a baseball player.

02:47.015 --> 02:48.798
I mean, we're about to have a bra there.

02:49.980 --> 02:58.495
And I mean, and I really worried about running into that guy in my role as executive director, the former student team guy.

02:58.535 --> 03:01.941
He's, you know, coming to my board and says, by the way, you remember me?

03:02.001 --> 03:03.384
I'm the guy you threw that time.

03:04.426 --> 03:09.895
And it turned out not to be much, but it was a tense situation because there was a lot of,

03:11.562 --> 03:19.514
mouthing and little stuff between non-regs and the core guys in those days except when you left the campus and you won.

03:20.195 --> 03:37.562
You know that was where it ended because you're an Aggie and and when I competed they supported me and everything but a lot of the there's a lot of mouthing and but I remember you know going to class with the core guys and it was generally it was mostly fun type stuff.

03:37.642 --> 03:39.865
One time they were marching by Hart Hall

03:40.250 --> 03:43.417
and they used to march right down there and military walk right going to Cebiza.

03:44.159 --> 03:46.064
Well, they had one of the rare snowstorms.

03:46.084 --> 03:52.639
So we up there just having more fun because they're standing straight and they won't waver and we're just clobbering them.

03:52.659 --> 03:53.701
I mean just clobbering them.

03:53.721 --> 03:56.588
Well, we get ready to come out to go to lay tables and walk down there.

03:57.142 --> 04:00.908
We opened the door, and there was 500 snowballs hitting the front door.

04:01.188 --> 04:04.513
And they kept us pinned down in there until we didn't get to eat.

04:04.533 --> 04:07.378
I mean, a couple guys tried to make a run for it, and it was serious.

04:07.398 --> 04:09.962
I mean, you know, they were out there hurt, you know.

04:10.482 --> 04:15.009
So we learned not to push it too far with them because they had one thing going for them.

04:15.049 --> 04:18.334
They were organized and disciplined and obeyed orders.

04:18.354 --> 04:22.761
And, you know, all they had to do was say, we want 2,000 of you right over there now.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.504
Now, the track team had some cohesion.

04:27.906 --> 04:37.600
Who did, if y'all wanted to kind of tease or compare yourselves, who was your, you know, was your rival baseball or basketball?

04:38.200 --> 04:44.589
No, there was kind of a camaraderie with baseball, some reason between track and baseball.

04:44.730 --> 04:51.499
For some reason, and even today those guys I still see and remember visit with them, we were kind of,

04:52.677 --> 05:00.387
For some reason, and this is the same way at the Olympics with track and weightlifters and stuff, had camaraderie and the swimmers.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.330
We kind of gave the swimmers a bad time, you know.

05:02.651 --> 05:06.055
Most of them were pretty boys and all the high school girls came by to see them, you know.

05:06.316 --> 05:07.697
The local girls would cruise by.

05:07.737 --> 05:14.607
The swimmers just seemed to have contacts out and they'd go riding around with the girls so we gave the swimmers a bad time.

05:14.627 --> 05:18.432
But baseball, there was kind of a bond between track and baseball.

05:18.412 --> 05:26.386
They didn't call it that in those days, non-revenue sports, so you know we weren't treated too special and probably most of us preferred that.

05:26.567 --> 05:37.025
And most of those guys went on and did very well, you know, and they had some really good people that were baseball players in those days and on the track team.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.027
I've got good memories of that.

05:38.047 --> 05:39.610
Like in academics.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.312
Almost all of y'all graduated.

05:41.332 --> 05:43.934
Almost all, because there wasn't any other way to go.

05:43.954 --> 05:50.460
Now some baseball players, we had a few that go on and play Major League Baseball, but track there wasn't any other place to go.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.082
I know a very few that didn't.

05:53.102 --> 05:56.906
They might have a little trouble, but they came back and finished almost all of them in those days.

05:57.186 --> 06:00.189
Now did you and Donnie take similar courses?

06:00.629 --> 06:01.710
Yes.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.692
He was in finance, I was in marketing.

06:03.712 --> 06:07.355
So not only were you roommates and good friends, you also academically.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.597
Yeah, we kind of stayed together, yeah.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.685
And quite often you all went to the MSC.

06:12.725 --> 06:14.891
Describe the role the MSC played for students.

06:14.911 --> 06:16.414
Well it was kind of a gathering spot.

06:16.475 --> 06:24.936
You'd go over and drink coffee for a nickel and refills, but you would kind of pull tables together and visit, you know, and it would be

06:26.367 --> 06:30.352
generally did a lot of the same guys and it was core guys and stuff once again.

06:30.412 --> 06:53.438
In those days there was kind of a feeling that we're out here all by ourself and it's kind of like a prison, sing sing on the brazos we used to call the place and and we used to you know sit around and talk about that and you know and lying around about our lot and life and when we ever do this can't wait to get out of here you know.

06:54.008 --> 07:01.150
kind of thing, but that was kind of the gathering place because the post office was there and the MSC coffee place.

07:01.230 --> 07:02.474
Did you get your hair cut there?

07:02.694 --> 07:03.878
Yeah, I got her hair cut there.

07:04.660 --> 07:08.271
On a Saturday, now, on a Saturday,

07:09.905 --> 07:12.409
I guess right at first I got my hair cut.

07:12.429 --> 07:18.799
When I got a vehicle, I started going down to Manor East.

07:19.139 --> 07:23.626
There was a barber down there by the name of Vinzen, and he cuts my hair today.

07:24.908 --> 07:25.369
Where is he?

07:25.829 --> 07:27.492
He's at Redmond Terrace.

07:27.472 --> 07:36.663
He's kind of partially retired so in the summer I got to work around him, but he's cut my hair probably since later in my freshman, early sophomore year.

07:36.683 --> 07:38.005
Is he the fellow in the back?

07:38.185 --> 07:38.806
Uh huh.

07:38.826 --> 07:39.707
Oh okay.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.088
AC.

07:40.768 --> 07:42.491
And you know we've grown old together.

07:44.213 --> 07:47.657
He used to laugh because he can remember how I got my hair cut when I came here because of my

07:47.637 --> 07:55.030
I didn't want it long because I was competing, but I didn't want to burr, so he'd just burr off the back and leave a little part place.

07:55.050 --> 07:59.958
And he said, that's a popular deal with the Corps guys now, but you know, it wasn't back then.

08:00.178 --> 08:02.102
Did y'all bowl any at the MSC?

08:02.122 --> 08:03.164
I didn't.

08:03.184 --> 08:04.526
A little bit, not much.

08:05.688 --> 08:07.872
And Wayne Stark, did you get acquainted with him?

08:07.892 --> 08:09.274
New Wayne Stark.

08:09.254 --> 08:11.359
Did he ever try to get you involved in MSC?

08:11.379 --> 08:12.882
Oh, not much.

08:12.902 --> 08:19.397
He came to me to talk to me about going to Harvard when I got out, and I thought he lost his mind, which he had, and that.

08:21.763 --> 08:25.491
And I got to know Wayne better when I came back to work here, you know.

08:25.471 --> 08:33.686
You know, you'd see Buckwires over and you knew who he was and that was kind of nice even though I wasn't involved in student government.

08:33.766 --> 08:43.042
I mean student government in those days had a dorm representative and they'd come over and beg somebody from the dorm to go over and do it, you know.

08:43.062 --> 08:50.415
The whole structure is built around the Corps and the Corps staff and everything so all that other stuff was just kind of, I was in marketing society

08:50.395 --> 08:52.258
because Herb Thompson was a sponsor.

08:52.779 --> 09:06.244
I was afraid not to go over and be in, and that was one of the few involvements in activities, but you know I, as an athlete, you know, you were pretty busy, you know, and you, they kept

09:06.545 --> 09:11.671
You know the time you got through late tables eating it was eight o'clock a lot of times before you got to study.

09:12.792 --> 09:20.482
If you, you know, and then A&M, maybe that way today in the dorms in those days, that's where a lot of bull sessions took place.

09:20.502 --> 09:22.544
I mean you'd sit there and talk and visit.

09:22.865 --> 09:24.406
But I have good memories about that.

09:24.547 --> 09:28.171
But the dorms were reasonably quiet for study, your old dorm was.

09:29.372 --> 09:33.277
Normally how late did you keep the light on?

09:33.297 --> 09:34.999
We usually go to bed about midnight.

09:36.110 --> 09:39.555
Unless there was a big exam that was worrisome, you know.

09:40.396 --> 09:41.858
And Donnie made good grades.

09:41.978 --> 09:42.319
Yes.

09:44.462 --> 09:48.267
The campus hospital, did you ever have to go to the Quack Shack?

09:49.930 --> 09:50.250
Yeah.

09:50.971 --> 09:55.738
One time we had a, they used to have a deal called Letterman's Association.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.703
and they banned it since then because they had initiation.

09:59.723 --> 10:01.746
First time you lettered you had to go through initiation.

10:01.786 --> 10:12.457
They'd dress you only in a toe sack and then they'd put syrup and feathers and I mean all kind of bad stuff, some bad smelling stuff on you.

10:12.757 --> 10:17.622
They'd tape up your hands and your eyes and take you out and tell you to a tree somewhere and you had to figure out how to get back.

10:18.142 --> 10:19.524
Usually with two or three of you together.

10:19.544 --> 10:21.726
Football would sometimes take them to

10:21.706 --> 10:23.629
Louisiana and it got to work.

10:23.649 --> 10:26.053
A couple guys got hurt and then a couple got arrested.

10:26.634 --> 10:31.181
One time the Stalins had to go over and get them out of the jail over in Navasota.

10:31.201 --> 10:38.533
They arrested them for indecency because all he has a toe sack on down there and they had to take a busload of them.

10:38.513 --> 10:59.155
go see the judge, talk her way out of it, but when I was going through that I got one of the juniors on the track team off to the side, a little distance runner, and I said, I got a track meet in California this week and I can't afford not to go through this because it'll look bad if I don't do it, but I won't be in bed by midnight.

11:00.603 --> 11:06.715
You better get me and take me out somewhere close I can get back in or I'm going to come wake you up when I get back.

11:06.835 --> 11:09.340
You know, threatening him, little guy.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.382
So, man, he was worried about it.

11:10.402 --> 11:19.961
So he took me out of here by, we didn't make it to Welburn and dropped us off on the road, about four of us, and we're trying to get a ride back.

11:20.101 --> 11:21.784
Well, he started worrying about it.

11:22.439 --> 11:24.103
Afraid I still wouldn't get my way back.

11:24.123 --> 11:28.214
So he comes driving down the road to check on us, make sure I'm still okay.

11:29.778 --> 11:32.906
And so we don't know who it is and we dressed like that.

11:32.926 --> 11:38.541
So we jumped over the bar ditch and I landed right on a barbed wire fence and cut my knee open.

11:39.702 --> 11:41.184
And it's kind of an ugly looking deal.

11:41.225 --> 11:46.473
It wasn't real bad, but I had to go and clean up the quack shack and say, look, I got a track meet, you know, so don't stitch it up.

11:46.493 --> 11:48.296
So they put those butterfly deals on it.

11:48.437 --> 11:51.822
And then I lifted weights that afternoon and it ripped open.

11:51.882 --> 11:56.530
But I still got back by midnight and he checked to make sure I was in bed comfortable.

11:56.510 --> 11:57.812
But that's the only time I went.

11:58.874 --> 11:59.795
Did you see a doctor?

11:59.856 --> 12:01.318
Do you remember?

12:01.338 --> 12:02.039
I don't remember that.

12:02.119 --> 12:04.704
It was around midnight.

12:04.864 --> 12:07.688
We got a lecture on what are you guys out doing?

12:08.189 --> 12:13.057
But you know everybody knew what they did in those days and I only think they did it a few more years.

12:13.077 --> 12:15.902
I think Ballard when he came here they finally put a stop because they had a

12:15.882 --> 12:17.924
Were you guys really wearing a toe sack?

12:18.064 --> 12:18.465
That's it.

12:18.745 --> 12:19.406
And nothing else?

12:19.806 --> 12:20.367
No underwear?

12:20.707 --> 12:21.368
Jockey strap.

12:21.448 --> 12:22.790
Oh, you could wear a jock strap.

12:22.810 --> 12:23.170
Okay.

12:23.831 --> 12:24.031
All right.

12:24.051 --> 12:26.013
I mean, you know, I mean it was a real toe sack.

12:26.093 --> 12:29.517
And you were to walk back or whatever way you could.

12:30.378 --> 12:34.282
You know, and that would be hazing today, big time, and everybody would go to jail and whatever.

12:35.464 --> 12:44.033
But I remember Curtis Mills came along as one of the first black athletes to Latter-day and him, and he came to me and said, you know Randy,

12:44.013 --> 12:45.435
I'm kind of afraid to do this.

12:45.796 --> 12:50.723
These guys get drunk, you know, and some of those football players, they might hurt me.

12:50.743 --> 12:55.429
I said, well I'll watch out for you, but I think you ought to do it, you know, because, well everybody went the other way.

12:55.469 --> 13:02.500
Even back in the end, they didn't want to show partial, but they went out of the way not to hurt him or something, you know.

13:03.982 --> 13:06.325
And so I had to

13:06.305 --> 13:28.480
watch out for Curtis to make sure because I mean he became world record holder in a quarter mile you know and you didn't want anything to happen to him but and he went through it and to get it you know get it done and it was you know I mean it was uh it was looking back it was not really a wise thing because you had one kid lose his vision in his eye he got hit with eggs you know rotten eggs on you and stuff you know.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.489
During your describe prods with a cattle prod too which wasn't much fun.

13:34.469 --> 13:45.488
Describe during your days what you saw of the first black students coming to A&M, particularly athletes, and how were they treated?

13:46.289 --> 13:56.747
You know, I never saw one of the track guys that I had contact with in the early days

13:57.740 --> 13:58.401
mistreated.

13:59.403 --> 14:08.176
Now I'm sure they felt like they were some subtle ways maybe or something, or left out of stuff, but there seemed to be, we had some really good ones though.

14:08.196 --> 14:17.350
We had, you know, Curtis Mills and his brother is kind of a maverick and, you know, a little more radical than Curtis.

14:17.530 --> 14:20.375
Marvin, but he was a great athlete.

14:20.395 --> 14:26.464
And McElroy, who was also a track man and a football player and was a

14:27.001 --> 14:29.215
And those guys came in and

14:29.465 --> 14:32.830
were kind of pioneers for them and did a good job.

14:32.850 --> 14:35.514
And there were some basketball players during that time?

14:35.554 --> 14:36.756
Well, they were a little later.

14:36.916 --> 14:37.617
Is that later?

14:37.637 --> 14:39.199
Yeah, I think they came in a little later.

14:39.219 --> 14:40.161
So it was track first?

14:40.882 --> 14:53.801
Football, I think probably Jackie Williams and Willie Blackman and Hugh McElroy and some of them were the first ones.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.904
And as far as you know, they were well treated also.

14:56.024 --> 14:57.126
As far as I know.

14:57.106 --> 15:01.993
See, I don't know of any problems of integration here.

15:02.473 --> 15:05.357
I know of lots and lots of problems of co-education.

15:05.457 --> 15:07.801
The women had, but I don't know of any real problems.

15:08.842 --> 15:11.606
And Fred McClure agrees with me.

15:12.988 --> 15:22.280
And when you track guys were sitting in your table at the dining hall, were the black guys at the table with you?

15:25.184 --> 15:25.645
Sure.

15:26.688 --> 15:28.712
There was no problem for any of us that I know about.

15:28.832 --> 15:31.297
I mean, I don't even remember anybody saying anything, you know.

15:31.879 --> 15:38.752
Do you remember any awkward moments when you all were on the road and stopped, checked in somewhere?

15:38.873 --> 15:43.342
Yeah, you would see that because, you know, there would be signs or something.

15:43.362 --> 15:48.392
But, you know, by then it started changing a little bit.

15:50.701 --> 15:55.413
I don't know whether you can put this in there or not, but I'll let you decide.

15:55.433 --> 16:06.921
I remember Metcalfe, who was a basketball coach, he got on with us one time, we were playing a predominant black team out of Missouri Valley and they were beating the tar out of us.

16:06.901 --> 16:09.325
You got to, you know, you got to get out there and guard those guys.

16:09.345 --> 16:09.785
Don't worry about it.

16:09.805 --> 16:11.528
He ain't going to rub off on you or anything.

16:11.548 --> 16:12.449
Get out there and guard them.

16:12.469 --> 16:14.712
But, you know, he adjusted.

16:14.773 --> 16:21.623
I mean, you know, he coached all white teams and then he was a very good, you know, he brought in some of the early ones and did well.

16:23.525 --> 16:28.032
You know, it was, you know, I felt good about

16:28.012 --> 16:32.487
maybe I didn't look at right, the agenda were well accepted and they were ours.

16:32.687 --> 16:35.216
Once they got here, you know, it changed it.

16:35.236 --> 16:40.232
I mean, those are our guys and nobody else better say anything about them and we didn't either, you know.

16:40.398 --> 16:48.431
And one of the greatest Aggie stories of all time was McElroy, you know, beating LSU down there, catching that pass, you know.

16:48.451 --> 17:04.296
I mean that was one of the great things that smoothed that for a lot of people because he became an instant Aggie legend in front of the LSU people that hadn't had many black athletes play in that stadium.

17:04.276 --> 17:09.985
Describe, during your student years here, describe the student body in general.

17:10.005 --> 17:10.966
What were they like?

17:11.066 --> 17:12.148
Where did they come from?

17:12.168 --> 17:21.342
Most of them came from places like West Texas and smaller towns, and there was a few from Houston and Dallas, but it seemed like most of them came from smaller towns.

17:21.782 --> 17:24.867
A lot of them had a rural farm background.

17:25.555 --> 17:32.446
Most of them were pretty physical kind of guys, not a lot of what we'd call sissies or wimps or anything.

17:32.826 --> 17:36.692
They were, there might be some guys, you had to be careful.

17:38.896 --> 17:49.112
Guys that had a tendency to be a smart aleck or something, the guys in the Corps, because they all looked alike and they wore uniforms and stuff, but there's some of those guys that were really tough and, you know, real.

17:49.132 --> 17:53.959
I mean, you know, you wouldn't want to mess with if they came from a country background.

17:53.939 --> 17:57.205
There was a real toughness, I think.

17:57.265 --> 18:03.075
I thought of most of them as being, you know, really physical, tough guys.

18:03.175 --> 18:05.319
And their basic attitudes and values.

18:06.020 --> 18:15.878
Very conservative and very patriotic in those days.

18:16.800 --> 18:17.601
It doesn't mean they're all

18:17.935 --> 18:21.529
perfect guys or anything, but they had a real strong patriotic deal.

18:21.709 --> 18:28.013
Vietnam was a tough issue and A&M was one of the few places there was very little dissent about it.

18:28.550 --> 18:33.457
After those that went and came back, you know, I think they had a different attitude about it.

18:33.477 --> 18:40.208
I think they saw things a little differently, those that had to go a lot of them, but they would have still gone.

18:40.228 --> 18:49.782
As far as you and your colleagues were concerned, you mentioned blacks, what about Asians, Hispanics?

18:50.335 --> 18:51.036
Did that matter?

18:51.256 --> 18:53.559
No.

18:53.579 --> 18:53.960
Let's see.

18:53.980 --> 18:57.765
We had, you know, Hispanics have always done well at A&M.

18:57.785 --> 19:01.871
And, you know, we just didn't think of them any different.

19:01.891 --> 19:08.079
And we didn't have too many Asian guys on the, on the track team, but we had them in classes and stuff.

19:08.159 --> 19:15.229
And I don't, I don't remember that ever being much of a, I don't remember anything ever happening at A&M that is embarrassing, you know, that way.

19:15.665 --> 19:18.948
And did it matter where people went to church, where they worshiped?

19:18.968 --> 19:20.469
No, I don't think so.

19:20.489 --> 19:22.551
You knew some Catholic boys?

19:22.871 --> 19:23.312
Yeah, sure.

19:23.752 --> 19:32.840
Jews, you know, and I think part of the old core thing took care of that because you all looked like, you know, you didn't know who was rich or who wasn't.

19:32.860 --> 19:34.722
There wasn't a real class system.

19:35.403 --> 19:39.486
This was before fraternities and sororities and all that kind of thing.

19:39.586 --> 19:44.811
And there were some guys that were very wealthy, but they didn't drive the big car here and they didn't, you know,

19:45.989 --> 19:47.471
Religious activities.

19:47.992 --> 19:53.158
When did you first get involved in any camp?

19:53.819 --> 20:02.891
Well Donnie was a Methodist and the Methodist church in Bryan had a lot of pretty girls so he dragged me down there and we'd just go look at them, you know.

20:03.672 --> 20:12.503
But when I got involved in Church of Christ and they had all, most of the churches had a campus program, a Bible chair we called it over there.

20:12.483 --> 20:19.590
It was kind of a place to go for support and you got a lot of support that way.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.154
And was there food on Sunday night?

20:23.174 --> 20:28.240
Well yeah, and then people had a chance in those days to invite the Aggies to their home.

20:28.260 --> 20:37.930
And I still run into people that went to their house today, you know, at our church over there that remember, you know, taking me to Sunday at lunch usually.

20:37.990 --> 20:39.992
Sunday night was usually the time when

20:39.972 --> 20:49.400
You went to Zorapi's or somewhere, you know, but... Did anybody ever worry about what you could... One time, it was 15th year.

20:49.420 --> 20:52.423
Did anybody ever worry about what you could or could not eat as an athlete?

20:53.724 --> 20:58.589
They did, but you know, I didn't, but usually they want you to eat a whole lot more than you wanted to.

20:59.870 --> 21:03.233
All right, break it up in here.

21:03.973 --> 21:06.055
Who were your close undergraduate buddies?

21:06.115 --> 21:06.936
I know Donnie Ayers.

21:06.956 --> 21:09.118
Who else were among your friends?

21:09.520 --> 21:17.039
Well, I had a big shot putter from Fort Stockton, Texas, George Resley, that came in a year or two after, a year after me.

21:17.059 --> 21:18.001
He's class 16.

21:18.102 --> 21:18.904
R-E-S-S?

21:18.924 --> 21:19.906
R-E-S-L-E-Y.

21:20.508 --> 21:20.989
Oh, Resley.

21:21.209 --> 21:21.610
Resley.

21:22.894 --> 21:25.099
And a big German fella.

21:25.805 --> 21:29.232
And kept up with him off and on over the years.

21:29.292 --> 21:34.823
And Jim Sebastian, who was class 65, a half-miler.

21:35.805 --> 21:40.735
David Glover, who was a discus thrower in the real estate business in San Marcos today.

21:40.795 --> 21:42.919
Kept up with them.

21:44.013 --> 21:48.223
And had quite a few of them but those ones I've kind of stayed in close contact with.

21:48.283 --> 22:02.157
Ted Nelson of course class of 65 and we traveled a lot together after you know the regular season was over in the early days to national meets because he was invited to all those kind of meets.

22:02.609 --> 22:06.414
In the dining hall, you all ate normally at the same table.

22:08.697 --> 22:17.948
What kind of eating habits did you all have that might have been a little different from the rest of the folks in there?

22:17.968 --> 22:20.791
Oh, probably not that much different, you know.

22:21.973 --> 22:23.655
In those days,

22:24.378 --> 22:53.592
especially sports like track and stuff it was just like students I mean we didn't expect anything different or did you eat more uh probably a little bit but not too much some of those you know it's most little guys and the core can eat a lot so you know we ate family style in the first few years then uh but you know I think the stories that you hear about big football players today or shot putters eating eight eggs for breakfast and all that and that was never

22:54.078 --> 22:54.759
Never me.

22:55.520 --> 23:02.870
Were there any things that you personally tried to slide away from that you didn't?

23:02.890 --> 23:04.552
Did you drink coffee and iced tea?

23:04.572 --> 23:06.675
Yeah, I did that.

23:06.695 --> 23:08.237
And soft drinks?

23:09.278 --> 23:13.804
I did that after I got down here and found out it wasn't supposed to be bad for you.

23:14.024 --> 23:14.865
What about red meat?

23:15.126 --> 23:15.586
Was that good?

23:15.666 --> 23:16.608
Yeah, it was good.

23:16.828 --> 23:22.195
You know, I was raised in West Texas so red meat and potatoes and red meat was

23:22.462 --> 23:24.384
high protein type things.

23:24.444 --> 23:30.510
I think there was a tendency in those days toward high protein and probably still today by a lot of athletes.

23:30.530 --> 23:33.032
Now were you athletes?

23:33.092 --> 23:38.097
Did you all participate in the A&M traditions like Yale practice?

23:38.117 --> 23:42.461
In those days athletes went to quite a bit of that.

23:42.521 --> 23:51.810
We went to Yale practice during the week and went to the games and supported other sports and

23:52.516 --> 23:59.224
And if we didn't participate, we honored the traditions by not walking on the grass when you're a freshman and stuff like that.

23:59.985 --> 24:02.608
What about, do you remember going to Silver Taps?

24:02.888 --> 24:03.929
Yes, we did that.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.472
What was, how'd you feel?

24:06.492 --> 24:18.186
Well, I think that was the one thing that was, to me, that was the one thing that really made A&M different.

24:19.027 --> 24:23.171
Did you ever go to a Silver Taps for a close acquaintance?

24:23.191 --> 24:25.454
No, I did not while I was in school.

24:25.474 --> 24:27.876
Didn't lose anybody that I was close to.

24:27.916 --> 24:30.559
What about Mustard?

24:30.579 --> 24:33.862
Did you go to a campus Mustard?

24:33.962 --> 24:34.903
Yes, we did.

24:35.464 --> 24:48.477
You know, it failed if it wasn't on a weekend because most weekends we were competing or doing something from by the latter years from January, first of January till the end of July or August

24:48.710 --> 24:54.378
very few weekends I didn't have a track meet when they started having indoor meets in December and January.

24:54.799 --> 24:58.224
Where where were some of the interesting places that you had meets?

25:01.488 --> 25:14.447
Well you know I was looking in a list of some the other day I can't even remember going to that I competed in but uh

25:18.882 --> 25:33.057
You know, places, I can't remember, but, you know, in the states, I went to Pocatello, Idaho and some places like that and, you know, Des Moines, Iowa and, of course, Lawrence, Kansas and those kind of places.

25:33.077 --> 25:34.379
Do you remember any?

25:34.399 --> 25:37.742
Fresno and Mount San Antonio College of California.

25:37.982 --> 25:39.244
What about unusual weather?

25:42.267 --> 25:47.893
Yeah, we had all kinds of that.

25:50.422 --> 26:17.475
not so much you know mostly by the time track season got around it was rain was the only real problem but I remember competing in Europe that you know in northern Sweden above the Arctic Circle had a track meet one time we had competed off the regular tour with Russia and Poland Germany and England then we some of us came back and extended the four or five of the athletes extended the

26:17.455 --> 26:28.132
trip and went to Sweden for 10 meets and went up in the northern part of the Arctic Circle, a little town of about 1,500 people.

26:29.474 --> 26:32.178
And we got there and we stayed in these little cabins.

26:33.079 --> 26:33.981
They're out in the woods.

26:35.583 --> 26:40.250
And got up the next morning and it was snowing in July.

26:41.673 --> 26:44.577
And so, you know, we can't go throwing that.

26:44.945 --> 26:47.990
And I looked down and the track was down just below these cabins.

26:48.010 --> 26:49.452
They didn't have any bleachers really.

26:50.373 --> 26:56.963
And they had all 1,500 people in the town were sitting down there waiting for me to come throw the shot put.

26:57.023 --> 27:01.430
So I got my stuff on and said, I'm gonna go down and take one throw anyway.

27:01.450 --> 27:03.092
You know, these people stand out there in the snow.

27:03.973 --> 27:13.888
And I got down there and I threw 60, it was around 68 feet.

27:15.151 --> 27:19.153
which at that time was the father's throw ever in Europe.

27:19.673 --> 27:30.709
And years later, American shot putters had passed through this little town, you know, where they still make mention of the European records out there.

27:30.829 --> 27:35.816
But when I went down there, there were 1,500 people, and they were sitting around the ring, and there was just enough room for me to throw out there.

27:35.856 --> 27:38.039
And I said, I've got to get psyched up, which I did.

27:38.079 --> 27:47.392
And in the snow, threw 68 feet, which, you know, under good conditions, you'd think you'd throw farther, but it was a motivational time for me.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.275
If they wouldn't have come out there and do that,

27:49.255 --> 27:55.065
And so, you know, that was one of those experiences that I'll never forget.

27:55.105 --> 28:00.934
I remember they gave me for a prize a hat I still have that the Laplanders wear, you know, out chasing the reindeer.

28:01.054 --> 28:05.762
My wife gets it out every Christmas and hangs it on a, puts it out.

28:06.755 --> 28:15.226
And in a meet like that, what did you psychologically, emotionally use to get yourself... Well, it was tough by then.

28:15.386 --> 28:15.926
We're tired.

28:15.946 --> 28:18.089
We've been traveling a lot.

28:18.109 --> 28:25.699
And basically, we're just... My wife happened to be with me then, which is the only time she really traveled to Europe with me.

28:26.700 --> 28:29.583
And they were paying, you know, our travel around expenses.

28:29.744 --> 28:31.726
And so it gave her a chance to see some country.

28:32.046 --> 28:34.129
By then, I didn't care about seeing much country.

28:34.582 --> 28:49.755
and didn't care about throwing much but some of my best memories were in places like that and it was motivational for me to go out there and the people wanting to see you throw well and they always had this expectation of 70 feet which put a lot of pressure on you.

28:50.090 --> 28:52.753
but they were more appreciative over there than they would have been in this country.

28:52.793 --> 28:57.819
They were happy with a 68-foot because they knew that was a good throw, where in the U.S., they'd probably been disappointed.

28:58.540 --> 29:04.446
Now, did anybody anywhere ever offer you a fiscal incentive if you'll throw so much?

29:04.606 --> 29:06.008
No, I never did.

29:06.088 --> 29:08.771
I think you had to ask for those kind of things.

29:08.831 --> 29:16.620
The rules weren't enforced very strongly, but they were such that you had to kind of

29:17.275 --> 29:21.060
probably go out and ask for that, and I really never got involved in that too much.

29:21.721 --> 29:36.720
In all of your competition, as you look back, can you think of any time when anybody ever tried to bribe you or hint at it or in some kind of gambling thing they might have going?

29:37.100 --> 29:37.661
No.

29:38.161 --> 29:39.503
Nobody ever.

29:39.483 --> 29:48.080
Let's see, you had one good shot putter teammate here.

29:49.362 --> 29:55.073
Nationally or internationally, who were your friendly competitors in the shot?

29:55.374 --> 29:59.061
Well, in those days,

30:00.323 --> 30:02.786
You generally were not real friendly with your competitors.

30:03.086 --> 30:16.864
It was just, it was very competitive, you were cordial, there was no mouthing like they have today, there was no trash talking or you even, most of the time you were careful what you even said with the media not to incite them any.

30:16.964 --> 30:28.558
And so it was not where you just sit around and buddied and visited with guys in your particular sport, except I had one

30:29.298 --> 30:35.730
that early on we started rooming together and traveling together and he was a shot putter.

30:36.233 --> 30:48.747
In the early days I was pretty far ahead of him but by the time 68 got around he was on my 68 team and if he hadn't got sick in Mexico City would have made me probably throw farther or I wouldn't have won the gold medal.

30:48.827 --> 30:55.395
But it was Dave Maggard and Dave is still a close friend today and we stay in contact with each other.

30:55.415 --> 31:01.161
He became, he was a high school track coach at that time.

31:01.647 --> 31:02.969
while we were competing.

31:03.009 --> 31:06.674
Then he became assistant coach at Cal Berkeley, where he attended school.

31:07.975 --> 31:11.280
And he was quite a few years older than me.
