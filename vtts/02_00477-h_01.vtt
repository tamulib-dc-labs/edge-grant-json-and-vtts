WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:14.717
And the length of these tours is brought about by 
the human element of our society,

00:01.043 --> 00:14.717
the softness in which we live. Okay. Okay. I want to 
talk about another issue as far as the man is

00:18.721 --> 00:24.287
concerned, and you've already mentioned this. 
I'd like your comment on it, maybe a change from

00:24.347 --> 00:29.532
your first tour to your— when you return in your 
command and that is by 1970 and the early 1970s in

00:29.680 --> 00:50.985
the press there were a number of stories about 
drugs, about enlisted men who didn't want to fight

00:29.680 --> 00:50.985
and who wouldn't follow the officers and about 
fragging. Maybe these things were blown up. I

00:54.309 --> 00:54.730
don't know. I'd like your opinion. Do you have 
examples? I

00:59.903 --> 01:16.199
read a lot about that before I went back on my second 
tour

00:59.903 --> 01:16.199
in August of 1971. I read a lot about it. And we had 
three

01:22.546 --> 01:28.712
or more divisions left over there. When I was asked 
to come back by General Abrams because of some

01:31.223 --> 01:55.847
failures at the DMZ and also Firebase Barry Ann 
down in the Miracle Division and some failures on

01:31.223 --> 01:55.847
the Cambodian border which caused the relief of a 
general officer that I later replaced,

01:31.223 --> 01:55.847
I found no fragging incidences. I did send one 
battery of artillery people home because I found

01:56.772 --> 02:09.088
them on marijuana one day and they weren't able to 
fire their weapons on the DMZ, so I just

01:56.772 --> 02:09.088
deactivated that unit. What happened to those 
soldiers? They shipped them home. What kind of

02:13.073 --> 02:14.335
discharge is it? I don't have any idea. I don't have 
any idea. Did they ship them home and discharge

02:17.660 --> 02:19.282
them? I don't have any idea what happened to them. 
Who was in charge? I warned them out of the theater.

02:25.291 --> 02:26.193
Who was in charge? There was a captain. What 
happened to him? I have no idea what happened to

02:29.699 --> 02:32.023
him. Did he go back, too? They all went back to the 
States. They were scheduled for deactivation

02:35.709 --> 02:47.890
within a month or two months anyway to go back home, 
and when I found them totally ineffective because

02:35.709 --> 02:47.890
of the drug, I just said, out, and that's what 
happened. I found no fragging instances. I can

02:53.880 --> 03:18.484
tell you this, that all

02:53.880 --> 03:18.484
sort of things happen to soldiers and to civilians

02:53.880 --> 03:18.484
if they're in a place in which they're 
dissatisfied and they're not properly occupied.

03:21.552 --> 03:30.324
and no one is providing them adventure or a 
challenge, they'll go make it for themselves. And

03:32.007 --> 03:45.025
when they're in an area outside of their own 
habitat of the United States, in a foreign

03:32.007 --> 03:45.025
country, as far as they're concerned, nobody can 
see them, and you can't tell what the hell they're

03:32.007 --> 03:45.025
liable to come up with. And that's exactly what has 
happened. The policy of the United States was

03:49.565 --> 03:57.393
conduct the war, don't kill any enemy, and don't 
get killed yourself. So what does a general or a

03:57.413 --> 04:02.719
colonel do under that sort of situation? He sits on 
his hands. And one with a

04:06.183 --> 04:15.673
burning desire to succeed, and understand all 
these problems and been through them before, he

04:16.278 --> 04:37.488
will create an ingenious way in leadership of 
keeping these men occupied and doing something in

04:16.278 --> 04:37.488
order to provide them some adventure and 
challenge. And I want to tell you that it isn't an

04:38.029 --> 04:46.200
easy task at all. Those elements wasn't provided 
to these men. They had nothing to do in a foreign

04:49.677 --> 04:52.802
country. And we're going to get into something. 
And that's what happens many times. It's not the

05:03.998 --> 05:09.967
first time it's happened, but I never saw it 
rampant at all. In Vietnam? In Vietnam, yes.

05:14.634 --> 05:14.854
Never. And a good comparison was that the first 
division in the 15 months I was with it won AWOL.

05:26.735 --> 05:29.337
People were doing something 24 hours a day.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.843
When I came back, that was in 1966 and 67. I came back 
in 71 and 72,

05:36.063 --> 05:46.933
and apparently, as a matter of fact, I was back 
there too. more or less, corral all of these evil

05:47.774 --> 05:57.285
things that was going on and sort them out and get 
people sorted out.

06:02.991 --> 06:17.528
And I found just what I've explained,

06:02.991 --> 06:17.528
the high command from

06:02.991 --> 06:17.528
the presidential the Congress, Department of 
Defense, and the State Department conduct that

06:18.183 --> 06:30.336
war, don't get anybody killed, and don't kill any 
enemy. And by God, what in the hell kind of war is

06:32.498 --> 06:36.242
that and what do you do? And the soldier says, why in 
the hell am I over here? And I agree with the

06:43.090 --> 06:46.013
soldier. Did you have men come up to you, or 
enlisted, or officers, and say, General, why am I

06:46.162 --> 06:53.949
here? I never had one ask me. He didn't have to 
because I told him why he was there. I told him he was

07:00.655 --> 07:13.587
there because our government wanted us here in 
order to, because it felt that way, and we're going

07:00.655 --> 07:13.587
to support the government, and we're going to do it 
the best we could, and whether you liked it or not,

07:00.655 --> 07:13.587
that was beside the damn point.

07:16.739 --> 07:34.096
And they never asked me, but in my heart I knew that 
they, uh,

07:16.739 --> 07:34.096
you want to let us fight, is what

07:16.739 --> 07:34.096
I'm for. And we were sending them home pretty fast 
then anyway. Yeah, right. I was wondering about

07:38.341 --> 07:44.006
another issue, which was some controversy. Of 
course, we lost the war and Some people say, well,

07:46.304 --> 07:49.467
we didn't use the right strategy. And then they 
say, Westmoreland strategy, well, one part of the

07:50.328 --> 07:56.114
strategy was search and destroy. Using that 
tactic to go out in the field and search and destroy

07:58.036 --> 08:02.140
the enemy. And then, of course, there was the 
accountability. How do you measure progress in a

08:05.403 --> 08:08.046
war like this? And one measure was the body count. 
And that's come under a lot of criticism. First,

08:14.637 --> 08:16.779
what do you think about search and destroy?

08:20.424 --> 08:41.708
Search and destroy in a very inefficient way and a 
very costly way of

08:20.424 --> 08:41.708
conducting a war against insurgency.

08:46.312 --> 09:14.901
Sir Robert Thompson, advisor to President

08:46.312 --> 09:14.901
Nixon, and I

08:46.312 --> 09:14.901
totally agree that

08:46.312 --> 09:14.901
to stop insurgency from one country to the other, 
you go after the base, the base of the insurgency.

09:15.725 --> 09:21.054
You go after North Vietnam and totally destroy it, 
eliminate it. You don't need any search and

09:22.897 --> 09:24.800
destroy.

09:30.709 --> 09:39.724
We also agree that we destroyed, and I had a major 
hand in this, in destroying the offensive

09:30.709 --> 09:39.724
capability of General Giep.

09:43.315 --> 09:53.566
At the time of victory for the United States,

09:43.315 --> 09:53.566
our home base collapsed.

09:55.989 --> 10:02.776
The United States collapsed and wiped away 
victory. Our Congress, our president, our

10:04.818 --> 10:09.964
government, our administration, our people 
collapsed.

10:13.657 --> 10:14.918
at the time of victory. Sir Robert Thompson

10:16.540 --> 10:21.904
could see that very clearly.

10:26.489 --> 10:28.150
Their base never collapsed. Their base was never 
attacked. They never came to a peace term until

10:31.453 --> 10:40.922
they got 11 days of B-52s day and night in November 
and December of 1972. Then they went to the peace

10:41.282 --> 10:43.444
table. which should give the world an indication 
of how you fight insurgency. I wanted to blow the

10:50.111 --> 10:58.143
dams and drown about two million of them plus all 
their rice fields and starve them out. It's war.

11:00.407 --> 11:04.873
Never

11:00.407 --> 11:04.873
happened. Johnson came over and apparently 
talked to Westmoreland about What do you need to go

11:12.314 --> 11:13.777
north? And Westmoreland wanted another quarter 
of a million men, so Johnson goes back and McNamara

11:13.857 --> 11:22.352
and the rest of them throw her a laird, I guess, 
throw up their hands. They just can't do that. We

11:24.937 --> 11:27.221
didn't need another quarter of a million men. We 
needed B-52s 24 hours around the clock, and every

11:29.124 --> 11:36.297
tactical fighter bomber that we had in the 
business 24 hours a day around the clock and after

11:37.272 --> 11:59.854
we had bombed them to shreds for about 30 to 60 days 
land the 82nd airborne and 101st air mobile or the

11:37.272 --> 11:59.854
first big red one air mobile over there and it was 
all over with did we do that no the great affluency

11:37.272 --> 11:59.854
here and the and the leftist elements in this 
country denied a frightened administration of

12:00.475 --> 12:16.796
Congress to face these problems with common sense 
and sound judgment.

12:21.982 --> 12:23.204
That's what it's all about. The American people 
did it to themselves. The soldiers, the sailors

12:27.249 --> 12:29.672
and the airmen, were really and truly the finest I 
have ever seen in anybody's Army, Navy, or Air

12:30.783 --> 12:40.053
Force or Marine Corps anywhere in the world. They 
were absolutely phenomenal.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.403
And I just can't say too much for them. They never 
lost a battle, as far as I'm concerned. I can't

12:53.268 --> 12:55.390
think of one that they ever lost.

12:58.255 --> 13:10.694
And they were in some tough ones and in a war which is 
best described by not a front line anywhere, but

12:58.255 --> 13:10.694
the war was 360 degrees. In front of you, behind 
you, all around you. Whether you were an

13:14.780 --> 13:22.272
individual or a division or a battalion or a 
company or what it is, the war was all around you.

13:24.226 --> 13:32.738
Now that is peculiar and unusual to our way of 
warfare in this country or any other country in the

13:24.226 --> 13:32.738
world. It's always been before all the good guys on 
one side of the line and all the bad guys on the other

13:34.220 --> 13:41.050
side. And you shoot at each other back and forth. 
That's not the way it was in this war in Vietnam and

13:48.059 --> 13:52.866
counterinsurgency. This was a very demanding 
thing that required not looking in one direction

13:53.572 --> 14:01.144
but totally all the way around. That is another 
thing that contributed to the hardship on the

14:02.226 --> 14:10.539
soldier and the officer. What kind of strategy do 
you think that we should have had to fight this type

14:11.941 --> 14:17.810
of 360-degree war? Go after the base. Go after the 
base, North Vietnam. Don't deploy any divisions

14:25.937 --> 14:28.540
in South Vietnam. Go take the base out. Take it all 
out. All the support out. Take out the

14:35.647 --> 14:37.089
sanctuaries. Can you imagine me having 
instructions issued that if I'm fired on from

14:37.930 --> 14:46.699
Cambodia, I cannot return the fire? And I said, you 
go to hell. And I was standing with General

14:51.925 --> 15:08.143
Prilliman on the Cambodian border in Tainan 
Province in a small stream, maybe 20 meters, that

14:51.925 --> 15:08.143
ran down between Cambodia and Tainan Province. 
And

15:08.203 --> 15:18.675
General Prilliman, Lieutenant Colonel then, who 
commanded 2nd Infantry, was moving along. found a

15:19.195 --> 15:29.086
lot of supply bases just inside Cambodia, many 
more on the other side, policy where we weren't

15:19.195 --> 15:29.086
allowed to fire over there. And I was standing 
talking to him when the small arms fire broke out,

15:30.528 --> 15:42.681
killed his radio operator, and wounded another 
man there near us. And I said, Dick, Let's get some

15:48.878 --> 15:52.442
artillery fire on these bastards. He said, sir, 
we're not permitted to fire over there. I grabbed

15:56.067 --> 16:06.740
the radio from the dead soldier and called 
artillery fire on them over there until I felt that

15:56.067 --> 16:06.740
I'd killed every one of them. And it wasn't 24 hours 
until it came from the President of the United

16:08.142 --> 16:18.835
States back

16:19.743 --> 16:32.678
to McVie, who has violated the no firing into 
Cambodia. Prince Suenok had reported to the

16:32.698 --> 16:41.869
President of the United States, the United States 
State Department, that they had been fired on.

16:43.591 --> 16:46.054
Well, the First Division was operating out there.

16:52.160 --> 17:01.417
Division Commander General Depew got called to 
find

16:52.160 --> 17:01.417
out who it was that was firing. First Division was 
the only one in Tainan Province operating on the

17:03.962 --> 17:08.430
Cambodian border.

17:11.997 --> 17:14.561
He didn't know what they wanted, so he went back and 
about. He called me and he said,

17:20.780 --> 17:23.524
You were in charge of all the maneuver and fire and 
everything? I said, yeah, that's right, sir. He

17:25.748 --> 17:31.336
said, apparently one of our units had fired into 
Cambodia. I said,

17:33.199 --> 17:38.587
well, what's the circumstances? He said, well, 
political authorities in Phnom Penh has relayed

17:48.472 --> 18:02.673
to the United States and the President has asked 
Comments McVie to give him a report on this and find

17:48.472 --> 18:02.673
out who it is that violated the policy.

18:02.693 --> 18:09.963
The outcome of this was, I said, I fired into 
Cambodia.

18:09.983 --> 18:16.673
I said,

18:09.983 --> 18:16.673
I was standing with Dick Preliman, yesterday 
afternoon talking to him when the fire came in and

18:17.598 --> 18:25.407
killed his radio operator and wounded another 
man. And the fire continued to come in. And I said,

18:29.471 --> 18:42.846
uh, I asked Dick to get some fire going back and he 
said the policy was that, uh, which I knew was that,

18:29.471 --> 18:42.846
uh, uh, He couldn't fire over there. I did this 
because it was his command. It was his battalion.

18:52.245 --> 18:59.215
And I wanted him to run his battalion, but he 
couldn't do that because he was following the

18:52.245 --> 18:59.215
policy. So I took the radio, adjusted the 
artillery there. And I want to say this, that I'm

19:04.602 --> 19:13.795
ready to call a national press

19:04.602 --> 19:13.795
and make it known to the world that I do not intend to 
have a United States soldier wounded or killed by

19:15.226 --> 19:37.335
enemy fire from Cambodia and me not fire back

19:15.226 --> 19:37.335
and if they want to send another boy out here in my 
place go right ahead but I'll be damned if I'm gonna

19:37.754 --> 19:47.188
Allow American soldiers to be shot, wounded, and 
killed from fire from some sanctuary, and me,

19:37.754 --> 19:47.188
allow them to get by with that.

19:50.373 --> 19:53.658
I'll put that blood on somebody else's hands, not 
my own. What did the general say? He went back to

19:57.003 --> 19:58.906
Colonel McVeigh. Did he agree with you? He agreed. 
He always agreed. He's a hell of a, most of the time,

20:02.331 --> 20:07.018
I guess, he's a hell of a great guy, smart as hell. He 
understand clearly he'd been in combat during

20:08.062 --> 20:11.446
World War II. He knew what it was all about. He knew 
people. And lo and behold, the policy changed the

20:16.291 --> 20:19.294
next day. Do not pursue, but return fire if you're 
shot at. That's what I did.

20:28.323 --> 20:29.584
Policy was changed.

20:33.909 --> 20:36.972
So that's the sort of stuff he put up. crap you got to 
put up with all political all gimmickry

20:37.255 --> 21:06.385
bureaucratic gimmickry politically all 
political stuff here in a democracy that's what

20:37.255 --> 21:06.385
you have to live with what'd

20:37.255 --> 21:06.385
you think of westmoreland

20:37.255 --> 21:06.385
well west a

20:37.255 --> 21:06.385
uh um

21:10.769 --> 21:18.820
ran for governor after he retired,

21:10.769 --> 21:18.820
so he must have some political aspirations.

21:22.125 --> 21:27.492
He treated me

21:22.125 --> 21:27.492
well while I was over there.

21:31.097 --> 21:38.447
He respected the fact that I was a combat leader, 
and that's all you have to do, and I guess that's all

21:31.097 --> 21:38.447
you can ask for. so you can discount any other 
things that you might hear or see or do. As long as

21:45.663 --> 21:54.936
the top guy respects you for what you are and is a 
combat leader, then you've made the grade, you

21:45.663 --> 21:54.936
see. So I have no comment to make about him at all, 
except that he did run for

21:55.737 --> 22:07.793
governor back here, Maybe he had some political 
ambitions all along. As a matter of fact, how can

22:10.905 --> 22:25.638
you be a four-star general and dealing with an 
ambassador every day and dealing with a president

22:10.905 --> 22:25.638
of a foreign country every day and at the same time 
be a combat leader every day?

22:30.703 --> 22:35.087
So I got no criticism of Westy at all. How well did 
you know him? Well, he used to visit with me almost

22:37.675 --> 22:42.361
every other day or so. And he'd come out when he was 
going to call off somebody of higher authority

22:42.381 --> 23:04.932
between the division, say the corps commander or 
the field force commander, but had already

22:42.381 --> 23:04.932
convinced Westy that he ought to change the course 
of action or he ought to stop this operation and go

22:42.381 --> 23:04.932
do something else and so forth. He's come out and 
visited me and reversed the corps commander. So he

23:10.649 --> 23:12.652
took your opinion? Absolutely.

23:18.221 --> 23:19.603
And that happened many times. Will you compare him 
with Abrams who took over in 1968? Well, you'd have

23:24.631 --> 23:32.404
to say General Westmoreland was a boy scout and 
General Abrams was a combat fighting soldier.

23:42.678 --> 23:43.519
Well tell me more. Well that's about it. 
Experience-wise,

23:47.724 --> 23:52.409
there's no comparison. General Abrams had, as I 
said earlier, been a very successful tank leader

23:53.450 --> 24:03.722
during World War II. As I mentioned, there were two 
of us, Abrams and myself. He'd been very

24:10.623 --> 24:12.425
successful. He'd been very successful at 
peacetime as a commander, and he commanded combat

24:12.445 --> 24:25.017
command in the armored division and commanded the 
division. And he was a tough guy, smart,

24:25.257 --> 24:37.930
got things done, highly respected. And the two 
people are just totally different

24:39.833 --> 24:45.840
personalities. As I say, one was a boy scout, 
immaculate, everything just perfect and so on and

24:46.040 --> 24:55.250
forth. That's not a good, rough, tough, brawling 
type commander that gets in and faces a cold steel

24:56.672 --> 25:09.486
battle, you see. Westie had never had that kind of 
experience.

25:17.618 --> 25:18.279
Abrams had. How'd you get along with Abrams?

25:24.105 --> 25:28.950
I guess he, best compliment he ever paid me, I was in 
the hospital when I'd lost his eye. When he said,

25:31.533 --> 25:38.460
he said, I want you to get out of here, I'm going to 
give you a, another command, and I said, well...

25:39.082 --> 25:48.616
And he said you were going to Korea. He said, you're 
going to Korea, and I said, well, I don't know

25:49.237 --> 26:00.513
whether I'll have a one eye or not, and he said, you 
son of a bitch, I'd rather have you with one eye, and

25:49.237 --> 26:00.513
most of these bastards were three.

26:04.458 --> 26:05.119
I loved him. We've been very close all of our lives. 
We had a battalion commander to tell you about,

26:08.191 --> 26:14.319
Abe.

26:17.102 --> 26:22.589
We had a battalion commander, and he had a 
battalion commander in the 4th Army Division

26:17.102 --> 26:22.589
named Pat Hyde. Pat

26:22.629 --> 26:30.299
was a diabetic, and he stole his way overseas 
during World War II. He had a class of 40 at West

26:30.339 --> 26:33.203
Point. And Pat was doing well over there and was a 
battalion commander and his wife would send him

26:34.432 --> 26:42.744
insulin in a cake and stuff, you know. Every week 
they'd send him a cake during the war and baked in

26:42.764 --> 26:50.715
the cake was insulin so nobody knew what was going 
on. He didn't have to be in the war. Well, old Pat did

26:52.618 --> 26:57.204
a hell of a job and we served together after the war. 
He was in the 4th Armored Division with Abe. I was in

26:59.888 --> 27:01.350
the 2nd, of course. And Pat died on us after the war. 
They kind of forced him out. He died. I

27:08.780 --> 27:27.963
was at West Point and Abe came up and

27:08.780 --> 27:27.963
stayed with me and Mrs. H in our house.

27:27.983 --> 27:30.105
And we had a neighbor from across the street

27:34.186 --> 27:44.398
So, this neighbor was Colonel Purdy, also a friend 
of

27:34.186 --> 27:44.398
Colonel Pat Hyde. Abrams and I, he was so dedicated 
and so

27:46.661 --> 28:02.539
respectful of what Pat Hyde had done as a 
commander. battalion commander in his unit in

28:02.890 --> 28:23.610
Fourth Armored had been doing World War II that we 
set up the entire night and talked about what Pat

28:02.890 --> 28:23.610
had done and what others had done and what many had 
failed to do. And

28:23.650 --> 28:31.918
we, in addition to that, consumed considerable 
amount of beverage and never went to sleep that

28:33.485 --> 28:48.198
night and got up the next day and

28:33.485 --> 28:48.198
took good care of Pat Hyde and putting him away. He 
was a hell of a guy. So Abram was a personable sort of

28:50.700 --> 29:02.850
fella and but officially he's a real tough fella 
also. from the standpoint of standards and

29:04.028 --> 29:08.815
requiring everybody to do everything right. Of 
course, I believe in that thoroughly and I think

29:09.235 --> 29:17.186
that's one of the things that created a closeness 
between the two of us. Do you think that it would

29:17.967 --> 29:33.208
have made much difference in the war if Abrams 
would have been that first commander from 64 to 68

29:17.967 --> 29:33.208
instead of Westmoreland?

29:39.314 --> 29:42.418
I have no doubt that there would have been a 
difference.

29:45.562 --> 30:08.612
But whether the political

29:45.562 --> 30:08.612
side of our country and the people would have 
allowed General

29:45.562 --> 30:08.612
Abrams to do what he knew that was necessary to win, 
and that was to go north and take the base, I don't

30:10.651 --> 30:11.312
know. I could only speculate on that.

30:19.202 --> 30:38.346
The way he believed in air power, and the way I 
believe in air power,

30:19.202 --> 30:38.346
I don't need many divisions if I've got the freedom 
of my air power.

30:38.647 --> 30:56.927
I think we had more than enough divisions if the 
politicians

30:38.647 --> 30:56.927
and the people in this country would have 
permitted us to use our power, our air power and our

30:38.647 --> 30:56.927
own ground power and Navy power. We could have 
eliminated that conflict over there, not in eight

30:57.888 --> 31:04.435
years, but somewhere between 30 and 90 days.

31:06.895 --> 31:09.138
Somewhere between 30 and 90 days. And how would you 
have done it? I would attack the North and bomb them

31:12.823 --> 31:17.029
into submission. And where would you have to have? 
I would then have landed safely all over the place

31:19.813 --> 31:29.968
because there wouldn't have been any resistance 
left. I tore totally their military capability.

31:34.154 --> 31:35.215
Not civilians. but I'm talking about their 
military capabilities, their training bases,

31:36.730 --> 31:53.520
their units, their divisions, their 
organizations, their supply dumps, their

31:36.730 --> 31:53.520
ammunition dumps.

31:53.540 --> 32:01.354
Totally destroyed them, totally eliminated 
them, totally eliminated the capability for them

31:53.540 --> 32:01.354
to receive anymore.

32:03.629 --> 32:10.019
What about the fear that politicians have that 
maybe China or the Soviet Union will respond?

32:13.865 --> 32:17.750
General Patton told me one time, don't ever worry 
about your damn flanks. Swear for the objective.

32:19.854 --> 32:23.659
And if you allow your flanks to interfere with you, 
they'll never take your objective. And he's 100%

32:24.721 --> 32:28.206
right. China wants to come in, just tell them I'm 
going to have to nuke hell out of you, baby. So if you

32:33.430 --> 32:41.397
want to come into this, I'm going to nuke hell out of 
you because I don't have enough ground forces here

32:33.430 --> 32:41.397
to cover you convincingly, and you ought to know 
that. So you get in it, and I'm going to nuke hell out

32:41.917 --> 32:44.800
of you. What do you think they're going to do? 
They're going to say, Jesus Christ, them son of a

32:48.863 --> 32:53.847
bitches mean business, and we better stay the hell 
away from them.

32:58.231 --> 33:03.235
What about the problem that we didn't, that the 
Congress never, and the President too, never

33:03.670 --> 33:05.572
considered this a war. They always considered it a 
conflict, and LBJ never took a declaration of war.

33:11.740 --> 33:15.525
I mean, you just can't invade a country without a 
declaration of war, can you? Well, we were still

33:16.326 --> 33:20.131
operating under a national emergency from Korea. 
That had never been called off. So, he wasn't

33:23.496 --> 33:32.968
totally incorrect in his not declaring a national 
emergency, but let me tell you what happens, and

33:23.496 --> 33:32.968
I'll describe to you what happens in case you do, 
want to declare a national emergency. Stacked in

33:38.108 --> 34:01.757
the Pentagon, and I used to have responsibility 
for a large share of it, it must be 10 feet high of

33:38.108 --> 34:01.757
emergency legislation

33:38.108 --> 34:01.757
that the moment you declare a national emergency 
is submitted to the Congress,

33:38.108 --> 34:01.757
that legislation will even cut down the amount of 
fuel that you put in your lawnmower.

34:04.724 --> 34:17.505
and your automobile and your lights, that 
legislation will stop the total progress of this

34:04.724 --> 34:17.505
country from the standpoint of doing what you want 
to do.

34:20.830 --> 34:25.317
And

34:20.830 --> 34:25.317
that wasn't necessary.

34:28.162 --> 34:31.828
And as I said, it wasn't necessary to call up the 
reserves either. It wasn't that much of a problem

34:34.525 --> 34:56.215
if you had gone about it to win it and kept the 
politicians out of it

34:34.525 --> 34:56.215
and let the military get it over with by going after 
the base from which they operated. We didn't do

34:57.818 --> 34:58.559
that. We have got to learn to go fight these wars and 
won in the Middle East without being totally

35:02.605 --> 35:32.410
disruptive to our society and our society on the 
other hand has got to respect this and quit and to

35:02.605 --> 35:32.410
come off of their leftist

35:02.605 --> 35:32.410
disinterest and lackadaisical attitude about 
what is of national interest to the United States

35:33.706 --> 35:41.636
of America and their welfare.

35:44.059 --> 35:45.581
And I don't know when that's going to come.

35:48.845 --> 36:03.223
But we can't be disruptive to the United States 
because we're going to go over and

35:48.845 --> 36:03.223
stop Soviet from taking Saudi Arabia and Kuwait 
and Bahrain and Iraq Israel. We don't need that

36:05.444 --> 36:13.294
much, we don't need total mobilization in this 
country, three years of mobilization and

36:05.444 --> 36:13.294
disruptive of life here.

36:16.037 --> 36:18.600
We need to selectively go about this. What kind of 
progress you make if you take all of the reserve

36:20.483 --> 36:30.275
officers out of the school system here in the 
Dallas-Fort Worth area?

36:30.295 --> 36:32.097
And all the doctors.

36:37.628 --> 36:38.769
and many, many more. Some of the critics have said 
that one of the problems with this war is that we

36:39.550 --> 36:48.457
were trying to win the hearts and minds of the 
people. That was one of the policies. In the South,

36:51.680 --> 36:56.684
yeah, we were using such massive firepower, which 
you've already spoken of. We were using such

36:56.704 --> 37:03.370
massive firepower that we were too dependent on 
technology. Do you think that we were too

37:03.910 --> 37:07.213
dependent on technology? Not at all. First place, 
out where the firepower was being used, there

37:08.830 --> 37:13.535
wasn't any civilians out there. They'd been 
killed off and destroyed 20 years before by a

37:13.575 --> 37:19.962
communist element. And firepower is the cheapest 
way to go. You use firepower instead of expending

37:24.327 --> 37:29.172
American soldiers. American soldiers, he's a 
person. He's people. He belongs to someone

37:32.435 --> 37:34.798
important in the United States. He's important 
himself. You don't want to expend the important

37:36.674 --> 37:45.628
part of America against the cheap part of 
communism. Under communism, people are cheap.

37:50.576 --> 37:55.725
Weapons and materialistic things are very 
important because they're atheist beliefs. But

37:57.127 --> 38:03.357
in American way of life, and in my belief in 
Americans, is that people are important. and that

38:04.248 --> 38:07.691
the cheap part of it, they're made by the grace of 
God. Bombs and artillery pieces and firepower,

38:10.034 --> 38:16.260
that's all made by hand, and that's cheap stuff. 
You can make it in the back end of anybody's garage

38:16.300 --> 38:19.743
in many instances. So why use the important part of 
America, pit the important part of America

38:20.724 --> 38:30.353
against the cheap part of communism? That is the 
American soldier against their soldier. Let's

38:35.416 --> 38:39.400
pit our cheap part of America against the cheap 
part of communism. Let them have the firepower.

38:41.542 --> 38:42.343
That's the way I see it. What did you think of the 
quality of the Vietnamese as far as fighters were

38:43.665 --> 38:48.109
concerned? You mean the South Vietnamese? Yes. 
They'd been at war for twenty years

38:51.573 --> 39:01.103
and their leaders were getting tired of those that 
hadn't been killed. And after you've been wounded

39:03.057 --> 39:18.780
about 10 times or more in 20 years of war, the 
incentive to go get killed with 11th time is not

39:03.057 --> 39:18.780
very great. And that's a very interesting thing. I 
think that might be true in the case of America

39:20.423 --> 39:25.450
also.

39:26.351 --> 39:30.938
I hope that answered your question on that one. 
good units and there were bad ones, but after

39:32.420 --> 39:40.913
twenty years, you know,

39:32.420 --> 39:40.913
you get pretty tired. Well, the North Vietnamese 
had also been at war for that amount of time, yeah.

39:46.441 --> 39:48.845
They, for the most part, were on the offensive. 
Yep. What did you think of— On the offensive, the

39:49.646 --> 39:56.757
offensive had a—the offensive it's a sort of thing 
that provides adventure and challenge and

39:56.990 --> 40:26.035
there's not much adventure into being on the 
defensive and being kidnapped and clocked and

39:56.990 --> 40:26.035
trying to defend yourself so it's an attitudinal 
sort of thing and in addition to that I have to

39:56.990 --> 40:26.035
compliment the communists

39:56.990 --> 40:26.035
in their products Now, maybe their methods of 
attaining it are not so— are attaining the highest

40:26.875 --> 40:41.254
spree

40:26.875 --> 40:41.254
and the dedication that the communist soldier 
has. I don't—maybe not condone some of their

40:42.796 --> 40:53.030
methods or any of their methods for attaining that 
within an individual, but they do it better than

40:42.796 --> 40:53.030
anybody I know of. You've got to give them credit 
for it. and they make a little guy very tenacious.

41:01.050 --> 41:19.174
But if you've got a person that's

41:01.050 --> 41:19.174
born in the hardship, raised in the hardship,

41:01.050 --> 41:19.174
trained to be a fighter in the hardship,

41:25.027 --> 41:40.266
That has one hell of a motivation

41:25.027 --> 41:40.266
in building tenacity

41:25.027 --> 41:40.266
in the individual

41:25.027 --> 41:40.266
towards surviving. You said earlier in this 
interview that you respected the German soldier

41:42.789 --> 41:52.941
even though you beat him. Did you respect the 
Vietnamese enemy and General Guillem?

42:09.851 --> 42:17.759
I respected him as a soldier, but I didn't think he 
was so great as everybody else thought he might be.

42:19.781 --> 42:23.805
Because when he came down conventionally for the 
first time, I destroyed him without American

42:25.000 --> 42:28.024
ground troops. I destroyed him totally with 
tactical air power and Vietnamese and a handful of

42:30.568 --> 42:42.304
American advisors

42:30.568 --> 42:42.304
and American air power.

42:45.829 --> 42:54.822
He should have been able to foresee

42:45.829 --> 42:54.822
after looking at capability of Americans to put in 
firepower, or the American availability of

42:55.325 --> 43:09.284
firepower,

42:55.325 --> 43:09.284
he should have been able to made a better judgment 
than he did. So, I respect him as a soldier, but

43:09.304 --> 43:20.539
he had no damn business of trying to set up his 
southern governmental headquarters in my area,

43:22.645 --> 43:26.671
in my ballpark. So he's pretty stupid as far as I'm 
concerned. Now, he might have done that in

43:32.339 --> 43:35.845
somebody else's ballpark, but not mine.

43:39.049 --> 43:40.552
Maybe he didn't respect the enemy. I don't think he 
did. He knew who I was, though. He did? Oh, yeah. How

43:46.440 --> 43:46.881
do you know? Oh, they monitor you. When you're in 
the clear on the radio, they'll come up on your net,

43:52.121 --> 44:05.682
and they'll call you by your call sign, when you're 
in the clear on the clear net. Did he mention you in

44:05.702 --> 44:07.424
his memoirs? I don't remember. No, I don't know 
whether he did or not. He probably didn't want to

44:12.051 --> 44:13.534
talk about that. If I was him, I wouldn't want to 
talk about that one at all. Because he just lost his

44:17.523 --> 44:19.346
ass. Every damn tank he had in a matter of eight or 
nine hours. Most of them never even got a chance to

44:26.197 --> 44:29.583
fire one round of ammunition.

44:32.468 --> 44:33.810
Not one round of ammunition.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.203
Let's talk about the press. A lot of people, we 
talked a little bit about this yesterday when I was

44:45.563 --> 44:51.296
leaving. A lot of people say that the press should 
not have been allowed to come into Vietnam because

44:52.078 --> 45:01.418
they spectacularized the war. that they had their 
own purposes. This is the first televised war in

45:07.420 --> 45:14.891
American history, and it had a profound impact on 
the society, watching that every single night.

45:16.513 --> 45:18.275
Tell me about your relations with the press. How 
did you get along with them? Do you think they were

45:19.297 --> 45:22.161
accurate in reporting over your feelings? I think 
a lot depended on the individual. I...
