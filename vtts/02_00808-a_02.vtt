WEBVTT

00:10.578 --> 00:19.261
Interview

00:10.578 --> 00:19.261
with Mr. D.A. Anderson, Side 2. I ran across a plan 
that I thought was very innovative when we were on

00:23.533 --> 00:27.102
the council, and that was a plan to anchor Mr. 
Miller's plan. Yeah, I'm very proud of that. When I

00:30.814 --> 00:41.125
look around and see all of these trees growing that 
are about 30 feet tall today, and there's several

00:30.814 --> 00:41.125
up and down this street. And I selected the seed 
from the trees at the East Cape and had them planted

00:42.050 --> 00:52.066
out at the sewer plant. Well, some of them were down 
at the cemetery as well. And then offered them to

00:57.255 --> 01:02.303
the citizens to plant. And it was obvious at that 
time because you could go around and there were no

01:02.283 --> 01:11.381
trees in front of the home. And this was an 
opportunity to provide the trees free. And now

01:14.548 --> 01:22.063
some of them told me that live oak would take all, 
you know, Years and years to grow. But all you have

01:25.249 --> 01:28.793
to do is look around the parks today. You know, 
there are two trees across the street that I

01:28.813 --> 01:34.561
brought in from my neighbor. Look at the trees 
around the cemetery and around the parks and put

01:34.681 --> 01:40.609
them around. I feel a little proud when I ride 
around. They're from acorns that I collected on

01:44.394 --> 01:49.401
the campus.

01:50.917 --> 02:02.288
I guess it was at the same place, but

01:50.917 --> 02:02.288
we didn't know. Yeah. And did you plan to move to 
Stafford? Yeah, that's right. They were about two

02:05.791 --> 02:09.234
or three feet tall. And then a certain day, we made 
them available. And we had some city people out

02:14.519 --> 02:19.023
there to dig them up. And I think the company 
started out I think they use, I don't know what they

02:20.684 --> 02:24.649
use, I forgot. But we made them available and quite 
a few of the trees even went to brine. Oh, really?

02:30.516 --> 02:30.836
Yeah. But I'm sorry that they didn't keep up that 
program because I, oh, I make, you know, I had a

02:31.717 --> 02:44.453
heart attack and I make a daily walk of one mile at 
least. And, of course, I look at all the trees and,

02:44.473 --> 02:48.177
you know, uh some some of these places could still 
stand a few permanent good

02:49.237 --> 03:16.780
permanent trees yeah around the park up here at 
thomas park and around the cemetery we put some you

02:49.237 --> 03:16.780
know that as you win the cemetery make the rounds 
and use usually light old trees favorite from the

02:49.237 --> 03:16.780
trees and the area then was a lot less tree 
populated, I guess, is the best way to put it. Well,

03:20.079 --> 03:21.881
it was here, right. It was fairly rare? Well, yeah, 
when I first came. Well, now that was later though.

03:28.066 --> 03:31.089
But people have tried to put in some trees right 
along. But a lot of the, you know, there were no

03:31.630 --> 03:35.033
trees. And they were building homes out in open 
spaces and no trees around. And here was an

03:39.937 --> 03:45.062
opportunity to put out some small saplings. 
Today, they're a nice-sized family.

03:57.216 --> 04:04.407
Well, I think making the

03:57.216 --> 04:04.407
city look, the appearance of the city, making it 
look like it's very important for the residents to

03:57.216 --> 04:04.407
create that atmosphere. So I thought that was a, 
you know, interesting story. What happened to it?

04:07.833 --> 04:08.113
Did it stop? It stopped after I got out. We, you 
know, the suit came along, a lot of things. We

04:13.932 --> 04:17.337
couldn't hardly do much under the suit. We were in 
the court down here, the county court. We won down

04:20.241 --> 04:23.446
here under Judge Davis. Then they dragged us over 
to the court in Austin and we

04:23.466 --> 04:36.505
were over there. There's another long story there 
I could tell too someday. But some parties are

04:37.707 --> 04:39.349
still living. I think that something like this is 
ideal. Now, a lot of people will buy trees. Some

04:47.052 --> 04:53.499
people do not know how to buy trees, and they use the 
wrong trees in the wrong place. And I see people

04:53.519 --> 05:02.269
still planting sycamore or planting cottonwood. 
Well, that's the worst thing in the world they can

05:02.369 --> 05:05.593
do. And they really need some advice. I think the 
city made a fuss when they were fixing this parking

05:08.371 --> 05:15.801
area here, too, and attempted to save the trees. 
Well, all the trees died. I could have told them

05:19.787 --> 05:22.110
that had they come to me. I would have told them they 
would die and why. But no, whoever plotted or

05:27.898 --> 05:34.487
planted that parking space, I can understand. 
They sure didn't seek advice. Well,

05:37.025 --> 05:44.776
they put, you know, there was a huge pine tree. They 
tried to save it. And all the rest of the other trees

05:47.039 --> 05:50.685
there, you know, they made new islands around it. 
Well, they were going to die. I knew that. A pine,

05:55.051 --> 05:59.137
number one, a pine needs an acid site, acid soil. 
That's why pine trees do not grow here naturally.

06:02.462 --> 06:06.087
They grow in East Texas where the soil is acid. And 
any pine tree that is planted here produces twice

06:07.028 --> 06:18.701
the tendency to produce its own acid through the 
deposition of needles and things of this nature.

06:18.721 --> 06:24.767
But then you come along with that lime and spread 
that lime all over and spray that lime all over the

06:18.721 --> 06:24.767
tree. You go and cut, sever the roots. And I just 
cringed when I saw what they were doing. And I'm

06:32.716 --> 06:34.538
knowing what was going to happen. And why they 
didn't come to somebody or go. Why didn't they go to

06:40.334 --> 06:45.559
the people they had that knew something about 
trees? I get upset when I go around walking around

06:45.759 --> 06:52.787
here and see the type of trees people are still 
planting. And why they don't, intelligent

06:53.207 --> 07:01.215
people, why do they plant a tree in a certain 
location? We wouldn't want to plant a live oak You

07:04.336 --> 07:10.526
want heat or sun in the winter around here. You 
don't want to be shielded by a big old light on a tree

07:11.187 --> 07:19.720
that will make part of your house cold during the 
winter. You know, little things.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.913
Well, that's something else. I haven't told them 
about getting my thoughts on this yet. I haven't

07:33.948 --> 07:35.230
seen Gary. I chatted and corresponded with him 
here not too long ago about another matter. I want

07:41.537 --> 07:44.320
to see him about that. Yeah. Yeah,

07:46.783 --> 07:50.747
I know. Who burned it?

07:55.613 --> 07:57.495
No, that was a friend of mine. I say friend. He's a 
colored friend. Oh, I see. And he said it to

08:03.971 --> 08:10.578
integrate

08:03.971 --> 08:10.578
the schools. I was wondering if it was something he 
asked today. They were having a discussion. No, I

08:15.603 --> 08:16.504
will not tell you who. Oh, yeah. But I know, and he 
did it to me with a big laugh.

08:22.531 --> 08:26.655
But he burned it in order to integrate the schools. 
And that was the first parks or recreation area

08:27.901 --> 08:34.927
that I tried to establish for the Negro community. 
I had what I called a mayor's committee made up of

08:34.947 --> 08:44.056
black people in the community. There were, I 
think, about nine from every segment of the city

08:44.076 --> 08:56.507
then, and with the different churches 
represented. You've got to study that thing so

08:56.791 --> 09:03.760
that there would be, you know, this cross-section 
balance. We met right here.

09:07.585 --> 09:12.311
And at first, they were reluctant to say anything 
to me. You know, even though a lot of them knew me,

09:12.331 --> 09:16.978
they just didn't know what. So about the third 
meeting, they began to open up. And

09:22.645 --> 09:26.410
how... the city could help them and what we could do 
with our financial resources and the like. Now,

09:36.883 --> 09:41.167
the Lincoln, or not the Lincoln, but the street. 
Going all

09:41.387 --> 09:47.252
the way down. Not

09:47.733 --> 09:52.137
Lincoln? Lincoln, Lincoln, Lincoln. Lincoln was 
one of the streets that they wanted in for that

09:53.643 --> 09:58.548
neighborhood over there. And the county road, the 
extension of the county road to the Wilbur Road was

09:59.069 --> 10:06.797
one over here. And we discussed that here and how 
that would help to get them out of the mud over there

10:06.817 --> 10:14.465
and do things over there. We also got in to such 
things as Let's see, housing, 238 housing,

10:20.845 --> 10:26.976
328. Yeah, for the put-in houses. We discussed 
that. And then there was a, I forget his name. We had

10:37.494 --> 10:46.549
an area then over in the south side, I forget what 
street that was on, where we started to build

10:37.494 --> 10:46.549
houses. under the HUD program for a very 
reasonable cost. And the group that sat around

10:52.341 --> 11:05.075
here thought that would be a good idea and that that 
would get some people out of their present homes

10:52.341 --> 11:05.075
and such good homes. Well, they built. I haven't 
been over there lately. It seemed to me they built

11:08.058 --> 11:12.964
around 5,000 or 6,000.

11:12.984 --> 11:14.025
And I encourage them. I mean, it was program 235 or 
238. This was my attempt to help the colored

11:18.507 --> 11:24.694
people. But they never took to it. For some reason, 
they never wanted to move into the rain after these

11:27.216 --> 11:32.882
homes were built. And that program went downhill, 
you know, fast. And then we had a meeting

11:39.009 --> 11:44.835
following, well, I wanted to know why on things 
like this. Then they brought out the matter of most

11:45.963 --> 11:56.793
of them, where they worked, and the low salary and 
monthly rate. And I said, well, with your help, I'd

11:56.813 --> 12:08.284
like to make a survey of all the Negro people in 
College Station. And I'll need your help, because

12:08.304 --> 12:12.708
without it, it wouldn't be any good at all. And they 
agreed. And we surveyed every Negro home in the

12:16.810 --> 12:22.857
community. They did. And they guaranteed me that 
this was an accurate survey that never had one been

12:24.660 --> 12:33.991
done so completely. And I knew where each one 
worked, like in the shoe factory or university,

12:34.011 --> 12:42.541
wherever they worked, number of children. 
Everything, every facet. in this survey, and then

12:45.852 --> 12:56.288
I put it all together, and several enlightening 
things came out of the survey. We met here and

12:56.328 --> 12:59.533
discussed them. Those were working for the 
university. Some of them were also at the really

13:01.656 --> 13:06.964
low end of the scale on a knowledge basis. Some had 
worked 15 years for the university and still had no

13:07.665 --> 13:13.774
benefits. They had nothing. So then I took this 
survey. Now, that's in the city. I only wished I had

13:19.919 --> 13:23.362
kept it private. I took the survey then and went to, 
I think it was Rudder.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.471
I think it was Rudder. And related to him some of the 
problems that we had in the city in terms of the

13:32.832 --> 13:43.483
colored people and their treatment at the hands of 
the university. And within a year, Rudder had done

13:44.459 --> 14:00.398
quite a bit in getting them on a permanent, you 
know, like instead of $2.40 an hour, $3 an hour,

13:44.459 --> 14:00.398
they would be making $300 a month. And then, but 
they'd get hospitalization and sickness, you

14:01.659 --> 14:08.548
know what I mean, the things that this makes. Now, 
no one knows this, but I worked hard. and getting

14:12.927 --> 14:19.574
this for the colored people in the community, all 
based on that survey. And then we finally worked

14:19.594 --> 14:27.442
through the Lincoln Street and the County Road, 
extension of County Road. Then we came to the

14:27.462 --> 14:30.164
Lincoln Center. This was another project. And I 
mentioned the burning. We got into burning. But

14:36.551 --> 14:40.555
I went ahead. And they told me that they'd do what 
they could. So we made that into a parks building,

14:45.686 --> 14:49.290
you know, for recreation. And I've never had so 
many frustrations in my life. You know, the kids

14:55.718 --> 15:03.127
over there would throw rocks and break the windows 
and tear down the doors. And I'd almost cry. And I

15:05.950 --> 15:10.035
said, now, fella, I can't go to my city council and 
get them to approve the maintenance of that

15:10.387 --> 15:17.133
building just continually. I said, I'm trying to 
do it. And I know you fellas are. And they were

15:19.676 --> 15:21.878
trying, Steve. So I said, something has to be done. 
Otherwise, we'll just have to give up on it. And I

15:30.626 --> 15:36.711
even went so far as to arrange for the purchase of 
some land behind that at that time. It was another

15:36.731 --> 15:38.773
lot. I think it was a lot, yeah.

15:43.528 --> 15:53.083
So then we met over there at the community center 
and brought in some other local people. And of

15:53.103 --> 15:58.191
course they were there, you know, just to listen, 
so to speak. And I explained to the whole group over

15:58.211 --> 16:05.402
there what our problem was and that I was trying to 
do it for them. And, you know, it was a place where

16:06.158 --> 16:09.922
their kids could go. And I needed their help, and 
unless I could get it, well, we'd just have to give

16:10.943 --> 16:15.607
it up. And they got up, and, hey, Anderson, we 
pledge to you, we do this and that. And they did.

16:22.054 --> 16:30.042
After a while, they took care of the kids that were 
doing all that stuff. And most of the Negro

16:31.303 --> 16:35.187
community today, at least the old people, You ask 
them about me, and I'll tell you, you won't have

16:35.993 --> 16:45.045
any, they'll do anything for you. Oh. Well, I was 
curious, had a committee for the Negro people been

16:46.988 --> 16:51.634
established before? Oh, no, no. I started it. Why 
did you decide to start it? Oh, I started all the

16:55.219 --> 16:57.262
committee idea myself. That was during my regime. 
We never had all these committees. Okay. No, the

17:02.029 --> 17:04.532
only one we had was the cemetery committee. But 
beyond that, that was really the, the planning

17:05.187 --> 17:09.912
zone. But the other committees I instituted 
because I saw need of traffic safety and these

17:09.932 --> 17:17.921
others. And so this, that was my idea. Well, why

17:21.545 --> 17:27.592
would they continue if they don't have a debate in 
here? Do you know why? Well, you have to, it was my

17:29.694 --> 17:35.160
committee, you might say, because I could, I had 
rapport You know, it got to the point where they'd

17:35.900 --> 17:48.031
call me up at night and say, well, Mayor Anderson, 
there's a fella from Houston over here at the Green

17:35.900 --> 17:48.031
Lantern, you know, over on the other side. And he's 
here to cause trouble. And he'd even describe him

17:51.834 --> 17:55.057
sometimes. So I'd call the police, and the police 
would go over there and get him and take him out. In

17:59.661 --> 18:04.185
other words, where they'd begin to help me and help 
themselves, too. Yeah,

18:04.334 --> 18:09.982
I know, but it wasn't then. Oh, and my heart bled 
because, you know, people would criticize me,

18:10.663 --> 18:19.915
well, you're just like a nigger. I mean, what are 
you trying to do? And I was doing everything I could

18:23.761 --> 18:27.987
to help them. And there's one thing, you know, I 
don't want it on the record, so I'll erase it. When I

18:33.781 --> 18:42.653
went in, I had a little problem with, of course, the 
standard of living was low. And they would come,

18:42.673 --> 18:51.605
well, they tried to, we had a little kitty set up in 
the county administered by Bill, the president,

18:42.673 --> 18:51.605
Bill. But that money was, you know, I think the city 
of College Station put $100 in it. The county put

19:00.437 --> 19:01.558
$100. Brian put $100 in it. And this was for 
indigent people that really weren't the

19:03.548 --> 19:10.738
desperate straights to use. And we had some 
situations out here in College Station among the

19:10.758 --> 19:16.346
blacks that were desperate. And I tried 
everything, through the churches and

19:16.366 --> 19:22.876
everything, to help all of them that I possibly 
could. And in desperation, I set up, and this, of

19:22.896 --> 19:33.471
course, was an outgrowth, too, of our meetings, 
you might say a fun, personal, in the Baptist

19:34.463 --> 19:57.994
church now, with the stipulation, and I added to 
it, you know, month by month, as I could, with the

19:34.463 --> 19:57.994
stipulation that anybody that needs that money, 
there was one woman that had cancer and

19:34.463 --> 19:57.994
had to be used for treatment. With the stipulation 
that anybody that needed money could borrow it, uh

20:03.151 --> 20:31.572
from this fund if they could pay it back well i 
expected to pay them back but if not just forget

20:03.151 --> 20:31.572
about it and before i established that fund i had 
all kinds of problems you know with people coming

20:03.151 --> 20:31.572
for me to me for help but once i got that fund put in 
and in place and got it started and added to it that

20:03.151 --> 20:31.572
really fixed it up

20:34.808 --> 20:42.038
And with my heart, I feel good about that, more so in 
a lot of things. But I wouldn't want anybody.

20:46.805 --> 20:49.790
Well, that is wonderful. Yeah. But I tried to do 
everything that I could for them. Well, for

20:54.857 --> 20:55.778
everybody. Because Saturday, you know, I was all 
over the city on Saturday. Any complaint, anybody

21:01.690 --> 21:09.269
had any, you know, I would say. Yeah. Well, before 
the fire at Lincoln was set, had there been... had

21:14.718 --> 21:29.095
people

21:14.718 --> 21:29.095
been discontented among the Negro community 
because they were frustrated that they wouldn't

21:14.718 --> 21:29.095
be in the same school? That's right. Is that right? 
So it not only occurred in the conversation, it

21:30.637 --> 21:35.122
also occurred to me why at the same time they were in 
the same school. Oh, yeah. But it's interesting,

21:35.843 --> 21:38.466
you know, knowing the history of London. That's 
right. Who did it and all. Of course, the record

21:42.747 --> 21:47.616
will never know. I mean, there'll be no record. 
When you

21:48.718 --> 22:00.840
were on the council, what was the council's 
feeling or length of feeling about promoting

21:48.718 --> 22:00.840
commercial growth? As

22:01.732 --> 22:17.961
I read,

22:01.732 --> 22:17.961
it really wasn't in the late 50s, well, not in the 
40s, late 50s. It was in the very early 50s. It

22:18.582 --> 22:20.866
wasn't very much commercial growth. And then it 
really picked up after that. And I was wondering

22:21.707 --> 22:22.609
what my college was like.

22:30.959 --> 22:37.265
I don't know how to answer

22:30.959 --> 22:37.265
that. I was just trying to think of the growth. 
Actually, we didn't really have much growth until

22:41.089 --> 22:50.179
later

22:41.089 --> 22:50.179
than that. You said 50, didn't you? Yeah. The only 
primary growth was over on the other side of the

23:00.305 --> 23:04.591
track. But if I remember, for example, those 
paying the highest taxes in the city of College

23:04.911 --> 23:18.148
Station, even up through 1962 or so, was Luther 
Jones. And Luther was, he had a number of houses

23:18.168 --> 23:26.840
that he was renting. So maybe for that reason he had 
to pay more taxes. I was looking at something not

23:29.313 --> 23:37.743
too long ago when I saw it fell down.

23:37.763 --> 23:44.570
There wasn't really too much growth during 
Langford's period. We had the, you don't remember

23:44.590 --> 23:49.016
the Bluetooth ports going in? No, I don't 
remember, but I heard of them. Yeah. See, they went

23:52.279 --> 23:57.345
out of business, and that was a surprise to me. But 
that

23:58.861 --> 24:10.759
was early on, yeah. But

24:10.779 --> 24:21.755
there was

24:10.779 --> 24:21.755
no push to bring in, um, the latest kind of industry 
here? No, not, not in, not particularly. But there

24:22.576 --> 24:23.217
was not a need for it? Well, it was just a small 
community here. And, uh, I guess our main concern

24:24.079 --> 24:25.020
then was, uh, fighting, and I don't say fighting, 
but getting along with Brine people. In the early

24:32.587 --> 24:33.068
years? Well, during Langford's period. For 
example, I don't know whether the records reflect

24:36.252 --> 24:54.535
it or not, but if you read between the lines, we got 
word one night that the city of Brine was going to

24:36.252 --> 24:54.535
incorporate the airport and university land on 
the first week. This came from a reliable source.

25:05.626 --> 25:15.478
So we met in an emergency session

25:05.626 --> 25:15.478
and incorporated all that land ourselves.

25:18.322 --> 25:23.408
Now that, of course, foreclosed on them taking the 
initiative. that is why all university land is

25:23.995 --> 25:50.340
within the city of columbus today what

25:23.995 --> 25:50.340
year i'd say around 63

25:23.995 --> 25:50.340
but i mean you know this these were little things 
and the agitator was quite a bit You know, this

25:50.725 --> 26:05.025
community was always different

25:50.725 --> 26:05.025
because

25:50.725 --> 26:05.025
it was

25:50.725 --> 26:05.025
an educational community. And, well, there were 
so many things, right? We were, you know, about

26:08.790 --> 26:12.916
seven miles from Bryan. I mean, it was an old 
country road that blacked out the road between me

26:12.936 --> 26:17.442
and Bryan at that time. Brine was a fur piece, you 
know, the town. And they didn't like a lot of

26:22.894 --> 26:24.436
things. We had our own hardware store in the 
University Hall. They made us close in. And they

26:31.045 --> 26:35.431
didn't like the idea of the creamery out there. 
They didn't like the idea of, you know, we used to go

26:35.451 --> 26:45.845
out and pick berries and, you know, pick three 
quarts and get one and all this kind of stuff. They

26:45.865 --> 26:47.007
didn't like that. There were a lot of things that 
just kept, kept agitating. You know, our group out

26:52.330 --> 26:58.137
here. Oh yeah, it was during the Lankridge period. 
Just little things came up. And then when I got in, I

27:02.823 --> 27:08.130
mentioned to you this matter of the taxes. And the 
same thing came up about wiring houses.

27:14.619 --> 27:15.660
Somebody was filed on and from college station for 
wiring a house in brian and he had a phd in

27:16.518 --> 27:41.580
electrical engineering and but he didn't have his 
license from brian but brian that wouldn't give

27:16.518 --> 27:41.580
anybody in college so that posed another of my 
problems and i did the same thing as i did with taxes

27:41.982 --> 27:48.289
And within the full space of a day, why, it was all 
rectified. But I mean it, you know, just one of

27:48.309 --> 27:50.611
these little things. But then you got to get back 
and understand some of the early families in

27:51.793 --> 28:00.021
Grimes liked to control everything. You know, 
that's another part of the thing. What bank in

28:04.226 --> 28:09.332
Grimes liked to do the controlling? Well... I 
think you don't want to talk about it. Well, you

28:14.236 --> 28:16.458
know, a certain thing. Like to dominate 
everything in the community. If anything went on,

28:20.243 --> 28:22.847
any elections were held. It had to be just like they 
wanted it. Their candidate had to win. You know,

28:28.815 --> 28:32.319
things like that. That's part of the political 
picture that exists. For example, I was trying to

28:36.845 --> 28:40.390
get a nursing home out here. Well, a nursing home, 
and it was supposed to be a sort of a retirement

28:41.180 --> 28:52.617
village that would be constructed six miles down 
the road here just outside the city. It would

28:52.637 --> 29:09.162
eventually come into the city, but it would be an 
ideal thing because they were going to put sort of a

28:52.637 --> 29:09.162
clinic with that and had the approval of the then 
doctor, two doctors in the city of College State.

29:09.715 --> 29:16.004
But Brian got on the ball and stopped

29:09.715 --> 29:16.004
him. How did they stop him? Through this esteemed

29:18.188 --> 29:23.295
senator, Bill Moore. You know, it's politics. 
Which are very complicated. Oh, yeah. Well, the

29:29.064 --> 29:36.094
bank that you were talking about today, he has on 
the college station a collection too, the Brian

29:29.064 --> 29:36.094
bank? No, but they wanted to control everything. 
They controlled taxis. They controlled

29:39.701 --> 29:42.083
electricians. See, they didn't have everything. 
In other words, you couldn't build without

29:44.285 --> 29:47.689
somebody in brine. You build according to 
standards out here, but no one could do it except

29:49.070 --> 29:54.776
someone from brine. I mean, wire your house or, you 
know, do things like this. So that's not right. I

30:03.192 --> 30:12.363
don't like injustice regardless of where it is. 
Well, they have the contractors. And they did the

30:16.048 --> 30:17.289
wiring. And they're the ones that were authorized 
to do it. Not to work in Bryan. But Bryan people

30:29.344 --> 30:32.187
could work either in Bryan or Colorado State. 
because

30:34.057 --> 30:45.210
we recognize you as being qualified to do it. But 
Brian says, well, that's all right, but we're not

30:45.230 --> 30:56.744
going to recognize your people because we want to 
keep fire and we want

30:45.230 --> 30:56.744
to keep control. They wanted to keep the control, 
that was the key. Well, did the bank that you were

30:58.106 --> 31:00.188
talking about, was it interested in college 
station officers? Oh, yeah. It was interested in

31:00.409 --> 31:02.511
controlling whatever went on in Grants County.

31:05.967 --> 31:29.370
Okay,

31:05.967 --> 31:29.370
we've talked

31:05.967 --> 31:29.370
about it off and on, but I wanted to ask you some 
questions about your years as mayor. And you were

31:29.390 --> 31:32.053
the first mayor after my first, and here you were 
starting a period after someone had been off with

31:29.390 --> 31:32.053
you for 24 years. What did you, how did you want to do 
things differently, or how did you pursue the role

31:32.073 --> 31:34.015
of mayor? Or are they the same? but there was a 
change in the city now. Oh, yeah, well, I think it

31:39.014 --> 31:42.699
was reflected in that five-year plan in a way. You 
read that over there. Yes, we did. You submitted it

31:46.103 --> 31:49.708
in your first year, I think. I don't know whether it 
was the first year or not. I just forget now. But the

31:56.237 --> 32:03.126
things that were enumerated there were things 
that I wanted to see done. Now, that change in the

32:04.017 --> 32:21.678
name that brought all that all over the United 
States from College Station, you know,

32:04.017 --> 32:21.678
malfunction junction and all that kind of stuff, I 
had to close that down. But I was really sincere,

32:21.899 --> 32:26.404
and I see it still coming up. You know what I mean. 
College Station, I mean, it's still, I wish we had

32:28.447 --> 32:33.653
Aggieland Something else. A lot of these things 
were in my mind. I tried to go through various

32:40.519 --> 32:42.921
areas. We had an explosion on the other side of the 
track and a former chemical plant over there. I was

32:51.429 --> 32:53.892
interested in that. I walked the railroad track, I 
guess about eight miles, and made a report on the

32:54.052 --> 33:02.020
track. It was bad then. I mean, the nails and the tie 
and everything else. They figured out the

33:11.247 --> 33:18.474
topography of the land and if there was a spill, 
where the spill would go. And, you know, down by the

33:18.594 --> 33:29.745
topography of the land and expressed some concern 
there and what could be done or should be done. In

33:29.766 --> 33:31.247
all of these areas, I just Now, that plan, that 
five-year plan, so to speak, I referred that to, if

33:31.649 --> 33:39.081
I recall, 100 citizens. And for their comment, 
digest, input, criticism, everything else. And I

33:48.296 --> 33:51.761
heard from most of them. And after I heard, well, 
then I had a better understanding of things, you

33:52.001 --> 33:58.011
know, Some of them, you know, were very good. A 
little thing like the cemetery, you know, I

34:04.645 --> 34:10.712
studied that for a little bit about the land. Did we 
have enough land? Would that land furnish us for

34:12.614 --> 34:18.180
how many years, you know, 20, 30 years? What 
restrictions should we place on it other than

34:19.501 --> 34:25.247
those we have right now? I don't know about the 
flowers they have right now, but that's something

34:25.953 --> 34:34.642
else. Oh, I gave everybody an opportunity to buy 
the plots. The land cost for the plot cost was very,

34:39.968 --> 34:44.593
very low. Way people were coming. And a lot of 
people combined were coming out here because of

34:46.795 --> 34:52.281
the trucks. So I gave our people an opportunity to 
buy lots before we upped the price. And then

34:59.047 --> 35:07.338
appointed people that were really, at that time, 
very interested

34:59.047 --> 35:07.338
in the cemetery. And I tried to look at each area for 
safety. The highway department didn't have too

35:12.245 --> 35:16.230
much money. They had some federal money for signal 
lights, but In the area of signal lights, you know,

35:23.159 --> 35:39.162
I tried to evaluate it there with others and spoke 
to Joe Hanover and as many as I could on, well, on

35:23.159 --> 35:39.162
each area that went into that five-year report. 
But then I knew that I wouldn't be approved when I

35:39.542 --> 35:44.590
got the Boyette one. Oh,

35:45.130 --> 35:50.177
didn't you talk about the Boyette section? Can you 
name the other ones that were on the council? Yeah.

35:53.931 --> 35:54.953
And who else were there? Oh, they varied. They 
represented the three wars.

36:04.625 --> 36:07.289
Boynton and this other war, I can think of them all. 
I forgot their names. Some of them, you know, they

36:08.510 --> 36:12.235
were on and then another one came on. Yeah, he's 
gone.

36:19.788 --> 36:19.928
Yeah. He went with them. Yeah.

36:27.498 --> 36:30.161
But that would be the three there.

36:36.549 --> 36:37.710
That's right. But Rosbam was on last, but there was 
another fellow on before him. I mean, they swapped

36:42.596 --> 36:43.437
off. The thing about it, I went to Rossman and sat 
down in his home and spoke to him about a lot of these

36:45.475 --> 37:01.516
things. And he agreed with me. He said, you know 
what I mean, Andy, that's right. It should be this

37:03.599 --> 37:04.740
way. This should be done. This should be done. And I 
said, well, why then can't you, why won't you

37:11.168 --> 37:14.773
support me? Why the heck? The people want this. Why 
are you denying it to them? Well, you know, after

37:23.023 --> 37:37.557
he's a good friend of mine, and this, that, and the

37:23.023 --> 37:37.557
other, and we go to a council meeting, I never 
could. I never could change it. So then from the

37:39.139 --> 37:42.122
next council, you know, I could almost dictate who 
would end. You know, who do you want as councilman?

37:45.095 --> 38:02.476
From

37:45.095 --> 38:02.476
then

37:45.095 --> 38:02.476
on, I didn't have any problems at all. We were 
talking about your five-year plan. Was this

38:03.718 --> 38:04.559
something that you started on? Had Mr. Lankford 
made a list of goals? No. This was really mine. You

38:06.862 --> 38:11.187
asked, you know, what was your thinking about the 
future. And these are some of the things that came

38:11.740 --> 38:21.801
to mind that I haven't looked at, and I haven't 
talked to you about, and I haven't looked at. Okay,

38:23.823 --> 38:32.658
I also... You looked it over, didn't

38:23.823 --> 38:32.658
you? Yes, I did. Sure did. Also, you were the first, 
and your administration was the first to have

38:33.620 --> 38:38.268
annual reports. Right. That was part of it. I felt 
that we needed to communicate with the public,

38:39.790 --> 38:43.857
yes, but what... The different departments were 
doing, you know, what we were doing. Do you know if

38:53.088 --> 38:56.112
they still have the papers? They do not. They 
don't? It terminated after I got out. Who got these

38:58.415 --> 38:59.055
papers? Well, some papers. Well, I know the city 
got those papers now, but a lot of cities still use

39:00.037 --> 39:07.065
the news media to get an annual report to the 
people. Oh, I see. The paper that you're reading.

39:09.688 --> 39:13.573
Yeah, they take maybe two or three pages or four 
pages or something like that. and

39:13.553 --> 39:31.542
give them stewardship for the

39:13.553 --> 39:31.542
city. And I just felt that it was well for us to, you 
know, let the people know just what was going on

39:31.562 --> 39:35.328
with Cleveland City. Right. Oh, yeah. Everybody 
was on the city's head in those kind of times. Also,

39:37.398 --> 40:01.690
I noticed that you, well, we talked about

39:37.398 --> 40:01.690
this, you decided that

39:37.398 --> 40:01.690
there should be more committees, is that right? 
Yeah. Yeah, I started with committee council.

40:02.892 --> 40:03.773
There was only a handful of committees? Well, the 
only thing is I recall on this planning zone, what

40:03.793 --> 40:05.315
kind of things? And what other ones did you 
install? Well, I installed the parks, traffic

40:06.076 --> 40:07.017
safety,

40:13.038 --> 40:15.280
There are about six of them. Oh, well, in my black 
community.

40:22.849 --> 40:24.390
Oh, yeah, beautification.

40:28.795 --> 40:31.318
All right. A

40:31.338 --> 40:36.804
what? Sanitary? I'd have to look it up. Okay. But, 
you know what I mean. In all these areas... Well,

40:43.109 --> 40:46.012
sanitation, yeah. Because we had rodent control. 
We had several problems when I was mayor. There was

40:53.480 --> 40:55.181
one polio.

40:58.525 --> 41:08.695
And we started collecting mosquitoes and sending 
them down to Houston for analysis. I don't know if

41:08.775 --> 41:11.378
that's in the record or not. Well, I started that 
because horses around here were getting polio.

41:17.860 --> 41:22.284
And polio wasn't, at that time, you know, wasn't 
really under control. And I thought this would be a

41:23.305 --> 41:30.091
helpful method to, or a step, to control. But if we 
knew that the mosquitoes around here had, well, we

41:30.992 --> 41:41.061
sprayed, but I mean we could intensify our spray 
and get, people more aware of the fact that if you

41:41.193 --> 41:50.524
get out at night or, you know what I mean, get bitten 
by mosquitoes, that there is a chance that you may

41:41.193 --> 41:50.524
get polio. And then there's another, I remember 
one instance where we had a rat problem. And that

41:59.836 --> 42:04.922
rat problem was primarily on a creek dividing 
brine and polystation. And this is where my

42:06.303 --> 42:10.427
committee came into play. Jim Ford was my rodent 
man. I picked a dentist, a rodent, veterinarian.

42:25.023 --> 42:28.226
Yeah, it was a sanitary committee, yeah. And so I 
called on this committee and picked the rodent man

42:28.246 --> 42:34.453
to eliminate the rats they were coming in the 
garages you know where the uh well that where that

42:35.817 --> 43:05.436
creek area is between the two cities yeah yeah yeah 
so uh he went over there and he got rid of now we were

42:35.817 --> 43:05.436
using stuff nobody nobody he knew what he was doing 
but he got rid of what he was doing Is that not

43:05.770 --> 43:09.234
allowed? It's not allowed today. It's not? Oh. But 
it got rid of them. Well, it got rid of them. You

43:15.841 --> 43:23.549
could go over there during the daytime, and they 
were running around in the garages.

43:23.629 --> 43:26.673
It was the kids. See, these are the things that 
worried me. I mean, anybody say anything against

43:28.054 --> 43:35.322
College Station, boy, I'd just . This was

43:35.487 --> 43:46.398
my city. Well, the committee may not be the same 
today, but they still have a lot of committees. So

43:54.147 --> 43:58.071
apparently, you started a . Well, I started the 
committee out in . But this health committee, I

43:58.872 --> 44:03.256
remember the mosquitoes and the rats and 
something else. I haven't had time to think about

44:05.963 --> 44:07.514
some of these questions. Also, I noticed that You

44:11.532 --> 44:23.831
wrote letters to them and memos to their 
councilmen, just discussing what ought to be

44:11.532 --> 44:23.831
done. I didn't know they still had them done. I 
wrote a weekly letter to all the councilmen. There

44:32.445 --> 44:33.226
are some of them. I don't know if it's complete or 
not. Is this something that you get to talk about? I

44:39.528 --> 44:47.304
felt, see, I was in closer touch with what went on in 
the city on a daily basis. And I figured that the

44:47.324 --> 44:52.876
council should be aware of some of the things. You 
know, some of them were short, one page. It

44:56.544 --> 44:59.089
depended on what transpired that week. And in 
order to keep them appraised of what went on, well,

44:59.643 --> 45:08.334
I wrote these little notes. Was it something you 
all did in May or something like that? No. It was

45:17.986 --> 45:19.968
something you did? Yes. Okay. Also, I had read that 
you tried to put a city library and city archives

45:22.051 --> 45:25.195
together and establish . Yeah, but that never, 
that never panned out. We never had the money.

45:37.070 --> 45:40.537
And this is, uh, I don't know what I was thinking 
about. This is Thomas, F.L. Thomas. The park is

45:41.959 --> 45:44.704
named that way. And we owe him this Thomas. He was a 
great friend of mine. Well,

45:49.542 --> 46:01.181
I could do nothing lying on that side.

46:01.201 --> 46:09.515
But one

46:01.201 --> 46:09.515
thing she wanted was the establishment of a 
library. And she'd donate all her books. I think

46:10.496 --> 46:11.037
she still has them. She has them. She has a wife. You 
know, she used to have a radio program for kids

46:11.798 --> 46:13.461
daily and weekly and something. She used to be very 
active. And she and others wanted to give her

46:15.715 --> 46:23.926
books, but they'd only give to the city council. 
And so I... I did all that I could to establish a

46:25.368 --> 46:34.465
possible library. I even considered 
establishing it in connection with the school.

46:41.919 --> 46:42.500
But I don't know. I just never got around to the 
finances and everything else. Well, that's

46:46.788 --> 46:48.931
something they fill in. I know. what i um were 
referring to were the archives established in

46:50.242 --> 47:14.106
some way to to categorize oh yeah that's uh i uh i met 
with objection

46:50.242 --> 47:14.106
when i went in they were doing
