WEBVTT

00:01.786 --> 00:06.712
Because we've been fully integrated. And I said, 
alert several of those truck units, and let's get

00:07.092 --> 00:18.405
the MP company there that furnishes an escort and 
convoy control. And I said, we want to start

00:18.425 --> 00:25.213
rolling trucks out of that depot by 10 o'clock 
tonight. This was then about 3.30, 4 o'clock. And I

00:31.925 --> 00:40.396
said, I'm on my way back, and I will ride down with 
the first convoy and with the first contingent and

00:31.925 --> 00:40.396
check it in. And so they said, OK, we're on our way. 
So they went to work. And by the time I got there,

00:47.305 --> 00:52.732
they were already loading the vehicles. And we 
actually shipped that first evening. We shipped

00:57.759 --> 01:00.362
60. 10-ton trailer loads full. So that was about 
600 tons. It was about 10 tons in those 10-ton

01:05.433 --> 01:08.656
trailer loads. And all the ingredients to bake 
bread. So... Did you get it down there by midnight?

01:15.464 --> 01:16.185
Oh, hell yeah. We got it there by... We started 
leaving the depot about 9 o'clock, 9.30. And I went

01:25.495 --> 01:28.678
down, we went down in a contingent of... Oh, I think 
10 trucks, 10 truck units. And with each 10 truck

01:35.820 --> 01:42.909
unit, we had one extra tractor go along in case a 
tractor broke down. And we had a wrecker with each

01:44.011 --> 01:48.857
two units. In other words, we had three wreckers 
for the six units, six 10 truck units. And one, six

01:55.125 --> 01:58.429
extra tractors. to cover, but nothing broke down, 
no flat tires, no nothing, it was just perfect. We

02:05.381 --> 02:13.894
rolled through the gates, we drove up to the gate, 
but we were pretty close to Ryan Main. We called on

02:14.194 --> 02:22.066
our radio and asked them to send an MP Jeep out to 
guide us through the proper gate they wanted us to

02:14.194 --> 02:22.066
go through. And they did. We were still out on the 
Autobahn on the call. They did. And we went through

02:27.269 --> 02:35.237
their first gate with our first trucks about a 
quarter of 11 at night. And the last one came

02:35.978 --> 02:39.942
through the gate a little before midnight. We put 
over 600 tons in LeMay. Was he there? Was LeMay? He

02:46.929 --> 02:47.910
was there about 1.30. And I was still there. I 
stayed there all night. But about 1.30, he drove

02:53.320 --> 03:00.750
in, and he was driving around, and he saw all these 
goddamn, of course, they'd already started

02:53.320 --> 03:00.750
loading aircraft. Sure. Trucks. And they'd drive 
the trailer right up to the aircraft. And they had

03:05.075 --> 03:09.521
DPs loading the airplanes down there. We used 
thousands of DPs in Europe then. And he said, my

03:13.607 --> 03:17.292
God, where did you get all this stuff? I says, 
General LeMay, this is not a drop in the bucket of

03:17.312 --> 03:22.939
what we got available to. just a little bit. Well 
anyway, for the first few days, most of the stuff

03:26.990 --> 03:41.289
that was sent in to Berlin was for support of the 
U.S. military contingent. And then gradually the

03:41.309 --> 03:49.500
airlift started carrying civilian supplies and 
things like this. because it had to, because we

03:49.987 --> 03:55.875
flew in all the necessities for life in West 
Berlin. And as it developed, it developed very

03:56.877 --> 04:09.495
shortly that the biggest tonnage problem of the 
airlift would be coal, black hard coal. And to

04:09.756 --> 04:16.365
figure out how to get it into Berlin, was really a 
major logistic problem. And LeMay, the old bomber

04:19.947 --> 04:29.578
pilot and bomber commander that he is, he had idea 
to take B-17s and put coal in sacks in B-17, in the

04:30.588 --> 04:57.810
bomb bays of B-17s, then fly over an area, there was 
a big area near Tegel, T-E-G-L, Tegel, or later

04:30.588 --> 04:57.810
another airport was built in Berlin to handle some 
of the traffic out of Tegel, and then take some of

04:30.588 --> 04:57.810
the load off of Tempelhof, but to fly over this big 
open space near Tegel, open the bomb bays and drop

04:58.027 --> 05:05.674
this coal and then push it up and scoop it up with 
bulldozers and front-end loaders. And they tried

05:06.735 --> 05:10.198
a few of it, but it just didn't work very well. So 
they finally decided that they asked me one day to

05:11.299 --> 05:22.930
find out how many duffel bags there were in the 
stock throughout Europe. And we came up with a

05:23.991 --> 05:26.734
figure, oh, about five million.

05:30.275 --> 05:46.584
And they said, well, we'll send some of them up to 
the Ruhr so they can play around with them at those

05:30.275 --> 05:46.584
coal mines in the Ruhr on whether they can fill them 
readily and then load them in rail cars and ship

05:30.275 --> 05:46.584
them down to the airfield. And we'll ship the stuff 
in duffel bags and then it can be unloaded easily

05:47.546 --> 05:53.396
and so forth. And that's how it was. And we found out 
that a duffel bag would make about 30 round trips

05:55.351 --> 06:04.063
before it wore out and became threadbare. And it 
worked out perfectly because a loaded duffel bag

06:05.005 --> 06:18.865
of soft coal or anthracite would weigh about

06:05.005 --> 06:18.865
120 pounds, I think. And a DP could handle it, and 
they could swing them up

06:26.249 --> 06:31.995
trucks in Berlin and then they dumped it out and 
shipped the empty bags back. And they very soon

06:32.015 --> 06:46.609
decided, very soon found out that airplanes that 
carried coal should stay in that service because

06:32.015 --> 06:46.609
they very quickly became saturated with coal dust 
on the inside. And after maybe a hundred trips with

06:47.770 --> 06:52.915
coal they would send those aircraft back to a depot 
in England where they'd be thoroughly cleaned out

06:54.667 --> 07:02.300
and all the coal dust cleaned out. I made a couple of 
trips up to Berlin in a coal plane. And I was up to

07:07.910 --> 07:11.416
Berlin during the lift many, many times. But it was 
the airlift during the period it operated That's

07:21.481 --> 07:26.729
going to be hard for you to envision, but averaged 
about 10,000 tons a day. I know. I've read the

07:27.590 --> 07:29.874
statistics on that. It's incredible. The 
biggest, of course, the Germans would just hang

07:31.957 --> 07:46.999
around those airfields and look at those planes 
flying and look at them coming in in bad weather, my

07:31.957 --> 07:46.999
God, in fog. Sometime you could only, you could 
barely see the front of your car. Lift planes were

07:51.656 --> 07:59.266
taking off and landing and of course that's where 
we perfected GCA, Ground Control Approach, with

07:51.656 --> 07:59.266
radar. It was during the Berlin hair lift. And it 
was really, I think, America's finest hour to the

08:02.490 --> 08:11.502
rest of the world for them to see

08:15.262 --> 08:26.895
with a peacetime effort to thwart a quasi wartime 
move that an adversary was making. And it gained

08:27.817 --> 08:37.708
for us, I think, a tremendous, a lot of respect from 
the Germans and from other people in Europe. to see

08:38.195 --> 08:45.265
the effort that was made and there were about 50 
some odd lives lost, American lives lost. Most of

08:46.187 --> 08:58.024
the lives that were lost were accidents caused by 
planes flying into the tails of other aircraft in

08:46.187 --> 08:58.024
the corridor, yeah. It was so tight in the corridor 
that if a pilot missed his approach into Tempelhof

09:02.258 --> 09:16.371
or to Tegel, and he missed and had to go around, he 
could not immediately go around and land again. He

09:16.932 --> 09:30.004
had to go back into the return corridor, almost to a 
point near the city of Fulda, so they could work him

09:16.932 --> 09:30.004
back in to the corridor to Berlin. You'd have to go 
back quite a few miles back in the return corridor.

09:36.346 --> 09:41.793
Now when you went to Berlin, tell me, what were the 
people like during the airlift? The Germans? The

09:44.416 --> 09:45.257
German people? They were amazed at the effort that 
American forces were doing to make the city

09:46.939 --> 09:58.894
survive.

10:00.224 --> 10:08.511
They were very cooperative, very receptive, and 
most appreciative, I think, of the effort that was

10:00.224 --> 10:08.511
being made. Was there a lot of goodwill in West 
Germany at this time? Oh, yes, an awful lot. And I

10:14.056 --> 10:20.542
know, of course, they all wanted to get as close as 
they could and see the operations. But they

10:21.182 --> 10:23.524
wouldn't let the civilians come on board. The US 
military would let them end up in the British zone

10:31.325 --> 10:35.010
other air base in the British zone that we flew some 
coal from. We let German newspaper people and

10:35.792 --> 10:40.078
stuff like that come in and see. How close did you 
work with the British and the French on this? Very

10:45.266 --> 10:45.967
close. Very close. Yeah, I made several trips up to 
the British command up in the British zone. But on

10:54.239 --> 10:59.847
Easter Day they invited the US invited, and opened 
the air bases for the German civilians to come in

11:00.350 --> 11:10.080
and see the operations. And they call it the famous 
Easter parade, the airlift.

11:17.727 --> 11:23.133
And as luck would have it, I guess, it was a 
beautiful day, a beautiful Sunday. The weather

11:24.214 --> 11:25.755
was just beautiful. It was warm. And every 
aircraft that could fly was flying. And that day, I

11:33.857 --> 11:44.592
think, the famous Easter parade tonnage, I think 
it was 12,700 or something like that tons flown

11:33.857 --> 11:44.592
that day. And at Rhine, Maine, they estimated that 
about 700,000 German civilians crowded as close

11:45.914 --> 11:58.993
as they would let them in on that airfield to watch 
the airplanes coming. There was an airplane in

12:00.172 --> 12:03.156
that corridor every three minutes. Every three 
minutes behind one another. Tell me about Curtis

12:07.861 --> 12:09.283
LeMay. What kind of person was he? He was a, he was a, 
I never worked for him, but of course I worked

12:10.725 --> 12:16.452
around him. He was a, he was a real great guy and a 
very, a very dedicated guy. and a real grassroots

12:26.817 --> 12:32.506
American patriot, I guess you would say. And LeMay 
is, you know, is about like Patton.

12:41.059 --> 12:52.116
I think guys like that probably are ordained or 
born to exist at the time they did exist. I really

12:54.256 --> 13:03.268
think Patton, I believe, Patton believed that he 
had been reincarnated, and I really believe he

12:54.256 --> 13:03.268
had. I think he did fight with Hannibal like he said 
he did in North Africa when he, after the Battle of

13:03.428 --> 13:20.972
Kasserine Pass, he said, I remember right over 
this hill, we fought this so-and-so, and sure

13:03.428 --> 13:20.972
enough, he walked over there and he said it was 
right there. And the other officers looked at him,

13:21.745 --> 13:24.408
they thought he was crazy. But I think guys like 
Patton and LeMay are probably people like that.

13:31.775 --> 13:42.046
But anyway, the Berlin Airlift, I really believe, 
was one of America's finest hours. Now, some

13:42.967 --> 13:45.289
people will disagree with that. They will think 
that we showed weakness by resorting to the

13:49.792 --> 13:51.815
airlift. I don't really think so. I think we 
probably could have maybe made a show of force and

13:54.818 --> 14:10.598
pushed a convoy up there with armored vehicles in 
the lead and fought our way into Berlin. But I think

14:11.720 --> 14:16.626
what we did so amazed and so humiliated the 
Russians that I think it was a bigger defeat for

14:17.028 --> 14:28.158
them than if we had run over them with tanks. I think 
it was one of America's finest hours. It was really

14:34.384 --> 14:36.546
quite an operation. And there's a little side to 
the airlift that's never been told. I'll tell you,

14:47.791 --> 14:52.077
and if I'm ever called up about it, I'll deny it. But 
early in the airlift, one of the real headaches was

14:53.298 --> 15:11.622
that, how

14:53.298 --> 15:11.622
in the hell are we going to get a little gasoline up 
there, and the liquid fuels?

15:16.765 --> 15:23.775
Not only for the military contingent, but for the 
civilian population.

15:23.935 --> 15:29.764
The British had a few tanker planes up in their zone 
that they had used during World War II. We didn't

15:30.505 --> 15:33.630
have any tanker planes in Europe at that time. So a 
few tanker loads using those British tanker

15:35.592 --> 15:41.541
planes were flown up there.

15:45.082 --> 16:13.941
Then I think it was an American civilian 
representative, I believe it was Shell Oil,

15:45.082 --> 16:13.941
said that he's pretty sure we could, by using some 
of the canals and rivers and so forth in the

15:45.082 --> 16:13.941
northern part of Germany from Hamburg, we could 
work our way into Berlin with barges. liquid fuel

16:14.444 --> 16:32.447
and he believes that by bribing the right Russian 
officers when we got to the Russian zone we could

16:14.444 --> 16:32.447
get in barge loads of liquid fuel gasoline and 
diesel and so forth. He was given the go-ahead to do

16:32.467 --> 16:36.672
that to make those arrangements. Those 
arrangements were made and a lot I think most of

16:48.177 --> 17:01.596
was taken in by handing over to some Russian 
officers or Russian commanders, gold marks or

16:48.177 --> 17:01.596
gold francs or whatever. Whatever the bribe was 
made in, it was made in gold, so I'm told. But a lot

17:08.225 --> 17:17.138
of, most of the liquid fuel, because I know after 
the first two or three weeks, there was no more said

17:08.225 --> 17:17.138
about the tanker planes. And every time I went to 
Berlin, I knew nothing about it after that. And

17:24.275 --> 17:28.538
every time I went to Berlin, we had plenty of fuel up 
there. And I know I made a couple of comments about

17:30.080 --> 17:32.702
it. I said, well, Shell's able to get it up here. And 
it's one of those things we didn't talk about. The

17:40.509 --> 17:48.036
same sort of thing happened in Southeast Asia 
during the war with rubber.

17:49.906 --> 18:12.876
after the Japs swarmed all over a certain part of 
Southeast Asia, the word was put out that for every

17:49.906 --> 18:12.876
little sandpan or every little boatload of rubber 
that arrived in Australia, one or two ports in

17:49.906 --> 18:12.876
Australia, so much in gold would be paid. And not a 
big tonnage of rubber, but quite a flow of rubber.

18:19.960 --> 18:23.086
crude rubber came into Australia the same way. Did 
you leave after the Berlin? After the airlift?

18:30.879 --> 18:34.326
Shortly after that I was transferred back to the 
States. Back to Washington? Yeah, back to

18:36.029 --> 18:37.431
Washington.

18:40.777 --> 18:42.981
I didn't come back until 50. Yeah, but it wasn't too 
long because the airlift was on about a year. Okay,

18:47.254 --> 18:51.119
it was during this time, during the airlift, that 
Truman integrated the Armed Forces. What was your

18:51.159 --> 18:53.081
opinion on that? Well, I thought it was high time 
really that they'd be integrated because like

18:53.101 --> 19:12.985
those truck companies up there in Geeson and other 
areas and I know I had had some dealings with some

18:53.101 --> 19:12.985
black officers and all of them that I knew were, you 
know, very capable and very likable. And there was

19:13.808 --> 19:21.619
one, there was a black chaplain there in Geesen 
that my kids just loved and I loved the guy. And I

19:22.981 --> 19:31.253
later, we later ran into him in Japan and we've seen 
him several times since then and he was a

19:22.981 --> 19:31.253
wonderful, wonderful guy. So I think Truman made a 
very smart move doing that. Was there any

19:36.220 --> 19:37.302
grumbling? Yes, there was quite a bit. But I think 
it really was minimal. I think it was done with the

19:48.235 --> 19:54.463
minimum of problems, really. Did you have any 
problems at your command? No, none at all. Were

20:00.751 --> 20:04.476
blacks moving into your command then after the 
integration order?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.583
Yes.

20:10.542 --> 20:16.469
The quasi-problem I had with integration was in 
Japan. When was that? 54, 55,

20:20.914 --> 20:31.946
when I commanded all of the petroleum facilities 
in the Western Pacific. Everything in Japan, and I

20:33.668 --> 20:39.334
had operational control over the petroleum and on 
Okinawa. And these were mostly facilities that we

20:45.883 --> 20:50.772
had taken over from the Japanese. They were mostly 
underground facilities. And this was a joint

20:53.658 --> 20:55.341
operation. We had all the fuel for the Navy and the 
Air Force and the Army and everybody out there west

20:55.381 --> 21:01.913
of Hawaii. I had a couple of black officers at some 
of my terminals. My command stretched for 1,500

21:09.605 --> 21:12.289
miles. I had terminals on Hokkaido and up in the 
north and on Kyushu and way in the southernmost

21:12.389 --> 21:22.305
major island in Japan. I had a couple of black 
officers

21:28.437 --> 21:37.127
to a beautiful blonde-headed German girl who was 
the daughter of the former mayor of Berlin. He had

21:37.147 --> 21:39.851
married her when he was stationed in Berlin. And he 
was assigned to my petroleum storage facility and

21:40.952 --> 21:50.884
depot in Sasebo.

21:50.904 --> 21:52.926
There was a little bit of a problem there. have too 
many officers ourselves at that depot of about 15.

21:59.453 --> 22:02.797
But in the Sasebo itself, there was other military 
units. And there was a couple of minor incidents at

22:04.058 --> 22:13.469
the club, like dances at the club by this officer. 
It was a nice looking guy. Wanted to dance with

22:16.913 --> 22:20.837
other white officers' wives. And of course, other 
white guys danced with his wife, his white wife.

22:28.057 --> 22:30.821
So, but nothing real serious. And we had another 
case like that at a storage facility near Tokyo.

22:39.554 --> 22:43.379
But those things, they only happened once or 
twice. And most of the time, the black officer,

22:48.813 --> 23:01.788
went out of his way not to force himself to dance 
with or be put in a position where he would have to

22:48.813 --> 23:01.788
dance with a white officer's wife.

23:04.971 --> 23:17.385
But I think by and large, I think integration in the 
services certainly went a lot smoother than it has

23:04.971 --> 23:17.385
in other parts of our economy. in our daily life. 
Okay, let's turn to Korea. Of course in 1950 North

23:25.043 --> 23:34.253
Korea invaded South Korea, and America joined in 
the U.S. or U.N. force. What role did you have? I had

23:36.235 --> 23:39.018
very little direct role. I made several trips to 
Korea, and

23:45.867 --> 23:49.653
During the, I was not there at all during the 
fighting. Not at all. We have a, there's an Aggie

23:52.879 --> 23:58.889
who became a flag officer, Ray Murray. Did you 
interview him? Where does he live? He's a Marine.

24:03.597 --> 24:04.077
Marine. He's a major general. Ray Murray. He does 
not live in Texas though, does he?

24:17.592 --> 24:19.615
That's why I haven't interviewed him. He 
commanded the Marine Regiment that fought the

24:19.635 --> 24:26.785
Chinese at the Chosin Reservoir. No kidding. Oh, 
yeah. Ray is a... And he was a football player. In

24:31.672 --> 24:35.037
fact, he kept me from lettering one year at the end. 
Ray was an in. A heck of a nice guy. Ray Murray. Very,

24:39.904 --> 24:43.609
very distinguished guy. But I...

24:47.242 --> 24:55.611
I saw some service at Pusan and at Inchon after the 
Korean fighting. I spent about 60 days at Pusan and

24:56.452 --> 25:10.667
Inchon, but I had very little direct contact in the 
Korean operations.

25:16.064 --> 25:24.958
There's one thing that I want to tell you about that 
is not written up anywhere in any bibliography of

25:16.064 --> 25:24.958
mine. But I feel very deeply about it. It affected 
me. It affected the rank that I was able to achieve.

25:37.978 --> 25:40.602
It kept me from getting another star. I know that 
particularly. And if ever anybody

25:44.515 --> 25:54.109
really died for a good cause, I think I did. Right 
after I came back from Germany, I was assigned

25:55.210 --> 26:13.797
briefly, and that's about a year, in the 
assignment branch for military personnel, for

25:55.210 --> 26:13.797
officers and warrant officers. And during. So you 
were chief military personnel for Quartermaster

26:17.227 --> 26:20.631
General? Yeah, yeah. OK. Yeah. For about a year and 
a half. This was about 1949? 49, 50. And you were a

26:28.820 --> 26:30.542
full colonel at the time? No, still a lieutenant 
colonel. Because I had been demoted prior to the

26:35.167 --> 26:38.111
war. I was still a lieutenant colonel. But it was a 
colonel's billet. And I just loved it. My God, I

26:45.374 --> 26:47.779
loved the personnel. And I was there when Korea 
broke out and felt it had the responsibility for

26:47.860 --> 26:57.182
the recall of officers to active duty.

27:01.685 --> 27:05.731
deferred and guys wanted compassionate 
deferment. I had one officer's wife offered to go

27:05.851 --> 27:12.380
to bed with me if I did not call her husband to duty. 
Yeah, a socialite in New York wanted me to meet her

27:12.720 --> 27:21.593
at the New Yorker Hotel and everything to keep him 
from coming to duty. And, but the biggest thing,

27:21.613 --> 27:28.182
the thing that I'm most proud of in my whole 
military career During the course of this minute

27:30.625 --> 27:57.038
review of a lot of files,

27:30.625 --> 27:57.038
a civilian lady that had been a fixture in military 
personnel for 30 years, she was not an old woman

27:30.625 --> 27:57.038
either, she was a single gal, quite a swinger in her 
own right, but she came in to me one day and showed me

27:30.625 --> 27:57.038
a file. where there was a major discrepancy in this 
officer's file pertaining to his integration

27:58.942 --> 28:09.478
into the regular army. At the time... Was she in the 
military herself? No, no. She was a civilian

28:13.965 --> 28:15.727
personnel. Worked in military personnel and had 
worked in military personnel all these years.

28:23.680 --> 28:39.335
When the people were integrated, when I was 
integrated, and everybody was integrated into

28:23.680 --> 28:39.335
the Army, we had to fill out an exhaustive personal 
history statement about all our background, all

28:23.680 --> 28:39.335
our education. And one of the prime 
prerequisites, you should have at least two years

28:39.395 --> 28:46.262
of college. The military wanted the applicants to 
have at least two years of college. Some guys were

28:52.334 --> 28:55.318
integrated that didn't have two years. I think 
nobody was integrated that didn't have any

28:56.820 --> 29:00.885
college experience. So people filled out and they 
were, they provided transcripts of their data to

29:02.026 --> 29:09.856
substantiate it and so forth. And a lot of other 
personal history and so forth and so on. The FBI and

29:14.930 --> 29:26.454
the CID checked on all of these things and rendered 
a report to the Department of the Army on what they

29:14.930 --> 29:26.454
found and so forth. Well, in this discrepancy that 
this lady brought in to me one evening and showed to

29:27.296 --> 29:36.094
me, we were in the process of screening some 
officers to go to a school, to go to a higher school

29:36.749 --> 29:45.601
like the Command and General Staff College or 
something like that. She showed me in his

29:46.823 --> 30:06.030
integration thing where he claimed that he had 
graduated from the University of Cincinnati and

29:46.823 --> 30:06.030
that the FBI in their background investigation of 
everybody that was integrated reported in just a

29:46.823 --> 30:06.030
very terse statement that the registrar at the 
University of Cincinnati said that there was

30:06.972 --> 30:22.397
nothing in the records of the university to show 
that this individual had ever been a full-time or

30:06.972 --> 30:22.397
part-time student at the University of 
Cincinnati. And here he had reported that he had

30:23.359 --> 30:28.828
gone four years and had graduated And there was a 
photostat, a black, white photostat type copy of a

30:29.348 --> 30:43.102
transcript to that effect in his file that she 
showed me, that we looked at. And she said, do you

30:45.324 --> 30:48.627
know who this individual is? And I said, no. And it 
was George Gordon, last name. I won't even tell you

30:55.214 --> 30:59.338
the last name on tape.

31:01.327 --> 31:06.613
He was a very close relative to Dwight D. 
Eisenhower.

31:11.039 --> 31:13.261
And I said, well, that is a problem, isn't it? And I 
said, Josephine, why hasn't something been done

31:13.602 --> 31:19.949
about this before? Here it's been in the file, and I 
know before that, A lot of these discrepancies had

31:25.795 --> 31:37.531
come to light, and action had been taken, and guys 
had been kicked out, or when their discrepancy was

31:25.795 --> 31:37.531
shown to them, they had resigned. They give them 
that option. I said, why hasn't something been

31:40.114 --> 31:42.518
done about this? She looked at me, and she said, 
your guess is as good as mine. And I said, did my

31:48.025 --> 31:53.172
predecessor know about this discrepancy in this 
job? And she said, I think he did.

31:58.060 --> 31:59.486
you wouldn't have said it that way. And I said, 
Josephine, how many more major discrepancies do

32:06.245 --> 32:13.656
we have, and before, and I said, before we do 
anything about it, I'm gonna make a check myself on

32:06.245 --> 32:13.656
this. I said, how many major discrepancies like 
this do we think are still lying in these files and

32:13.676 --> 32:21.947
that we don't know about? She said, Colonel, I 
think there's at least 100 or 200 major

32:22.648 --> 32:28.156
discrepancies. Where they just outright lie in 
false statements about their integration. When

32:33.344 --> 32:35.627
damn good officers that didn't even apply or that 
were turned down began just because they had told

32:35.793 --> 32:43.444
the truth about theirs. And she said, I think 
there's at least 200. And I said, I can appreciate

32:46.669 --> 32:48.992
it. Somebody said he had 40 hours and maybe he only 
had 32 hours. To me, that's a minor, it's a minor

32:54.520 --> 32:57.504
discrepancy. But to say he graduated When the 
registrar said he'd never registered, I said,

32:59.789 --> 33:06.055
that's major. So I said, I'm going to do some 
checking on this myself. I called the University

33:09.639 --> 33:16.426
of Cincinnati, talked to the registrar, and told 
him who I was. And I said, I'm looking at a

33:16.446 --> 33:25.375
background report by the FBI on, I won't tell you 
the name yet, when you turn it off, George Gordon

33:27.599 --> 33:36.030
Moore, married to Dwight D. Eisenhower's wife's 
sister, married to Mamie's sister. What rank was

33:37.913 --> 33:39.234
he? Huh? What rank was he? Lieutenant Colonel. He 
had been a colonel and demoted. He was an

33:42.939 --> 33:44.221
integrated officer. So I said, this is a pretty hot 
potato, and I told him why. He said, my goodness,

33:52.212 --> 33:54.855
that is hot, isn't it? And I said, your university 
has said in this FBI background report that he'd

33:55.747 --> 34:03.194
never been a student. I said, would you please 
check that again, just to be sure that he's never

34:03.214 --> 34:10.040
was a full-time. Number one, that he was not a 
graduate. Number one, he was never a full-time

34:13.443 --> 34:17.967
student, and so forth. And he said, we sure will, 
and we'll get back to you. Well, about three or four

34:22.010 --> 34:24.032
days later, The president of the university 
called me, Cincinnati University, and said,

34:24.282 --> 34:36.013
we've really done some soul searching on what you 
reported to the registrar. And he said, we are

34:36.914 --> 34:43.760
prepared to state, and I will send you a telegram or 
a letter, whichever you think is appropriate. We

34:45.602 --> 34:50.846
are prepared to say that so far as we know, he's 
never even been a visitor on this campus. He is,

34:51.487 --> 34:53.749
number one, not a graduate. Number two, he's never 
been registered, either as full-time or

34:54.455 --> 35:02.767
part-time or evening or continuing education or 
anything. Never in any form. We've even checked

35:05.010 --> 35:12.001
the membership records of fraternities during 
the time period that he said he was here. We've

35:12.021 --> 35:15.866
checked other dormitory records, and his name 
does not appear. And we said, we think if he has a

35:17.729 --> 35:22.656
transcript, it's a fabrication. And I said, would 
you just send me a letter and confirm what you've

35:23.682 --> 35:28.349
told me? He said, I'll do that. I'll dictate it when 
I hang up. So I took his file and walked upstairs and

35:33.376 --> 35:41.147
showed it to my boss, the major general. I said, we 
really got a hot one on our hands here. And he said,

35:45.173 --> 35:48.137
my god, it is, isn't it? And I said, I think there's 
some more like it, but there won't any be as big as

35:49.417 --> 35:53.841
this. So he said, well, why don't you make a check 
and let's see how many more we've got. Meanwhile,

36:03.510 --> 36:16.263
let me do some talking to some of the guys over in the 
staff and over in the G1 and the general staff and

36:03.510 --> 36:16.263
see what we ought to do. And I said, I know what we 
ought to do. I ought to confront him and tell him

36:19.555 --> 36:30.152
what's his reply to this, what's his explanation 
of it, and tell him he has two alternatives. I'll

36:30.573 --> 36:41.791
take his resignation right now, or he can fight it, 
and we can put him before a board to show cause why he

36:30.573 --> 36:41.791
should not be separated. And he said, my God, that 
would be tough. And I said, but I know that we've got

36:44.159 --> 36:46.842
to do it. And I said, there's just no ifs, ands, and 
buts about it. So. Who was your commanding

36:53.268 --> 36:54.569
general? A fellow named Fellman, Herman Fellman. 
And a gutty little guy. And he was mixed up at one

37:00.975 --> 37:08.642
time in the, in the, he was drawn into that Harry 
Vaughn. Oh, yeah. The Truman. Sure, the Harry

37:10.004 --> 37:12.026
Vaughn Truman episode. Yeah, yeah.

37:15.749 --> 37:18.592
with Vaughn and so forth. Very courageous little 
guy. And I said, well, I'm going to have the people

37:21.714 --> 37:33.725
work through all, go through 9,000 odd files that 
we've got here on integrated officers and see how

37:21.714 --> 37:33.725
many major. Well, we did that. And it took about a 
week to do that. In the meantime, I'd gotten the

37:40.091 --> 37:43.174
confirmation from the president. We came up with 
89 major discrepancy filed, 89. Out of the 89,

37:51.016 --> 37:56.143
there were about 12 that we... 89 out of 9,000? 
Yeah. Out of the 89, there were about 12 that we

37:58.066 --> 38:07.057
excused because we believed they were just 
oversights or something. And we called, I called

38:07.478 --> 38:10.782
each of those 12 up And I said, is this true or that 
true? And then I wrote a memo for the record and put

38:14.603 --> 38:22.191
them in their files and saying, these 
discrepancies have been resolved and the matter

38:14.603 --> 38:22.191
is closed. The other 70-odd, we started bringing 
them in and telling them, confronting them with

38:22.671 --> 38:36.545
it, and saying, you have this option. You can 
resign right now. We'll give you. You can dictate

38:39.567 --> 38:48.788
your resignation to my secretary and we'll 
separate you today or tomorrow at Fort Myer and

38:39.567 --> 38:48.788
that's all there is to it. Nothing will happen. If 
we take board action and you are removed from the

38:51.755 --> 38:58.791
services, It will be kind of a neuter removal. You 
will be without honor and without dishonor. You

39:06.676 --> 39:12.604
will not get any veterans benefits or anything. 
And I said, your best way is to resign. Well, out of

39:17.932 --> 39:23.120
the 75, about 69 of them did that. They just 
resigned. And one of the guys, one of the 79, While

39:29.737 --> 39:38.587
he was sitting there, he had two

39:29.737 --> 39:38.587
Purple Hearts. He had his ribbons all on. And he had

39:41.630 --> 39:51.581
one other combat decoration that I knew that he 
didn't have. Anyway,

39:51.621 --> 39:59.490
I called Josephine in. going to dictate his 
resignation. I said, Josephine, I don't think

40:03.120 --> 40:07.326
he's entitled to those decorations. And I said, 
make a quick check in this file and call the AG, the

40:08.448 --> 40:16.781
AG's Decorations Office, because they've got all 
those awards. This was a, oh Christ,

40:16.841 --> 40:25.495
a DSC, a Distinguished Service Cross. And I said, 
call them and see if he was awarded. And I don't

40:29.602 --> 40:31.204
think he ever was. I'm positive he's not. And she 
came back in before he even came back in the office.

40:37.392 --> 40:45.723
She came back in about 20 minutes and said, the AG 
says, number one, he does not, he's not entitled to

40:37.392 --> 40:45.723
the Purple Heart. And he's not entitled to the DSC. 
And he's also the only awards, the only awards

40:56.525 --> 41:06.997
So when he came back in, I saw that he had about four 
ribbons that he was wearing that

40:56.525 --> 41:06.997
he was not entitled to. And I just asked him about it 
right then and there. I said, you're wearing a

41:11.162 --> 41:22.716
combat award there that most of them that were 
awarded were not given to the recipients, but were

41:11.162 --> 41:22.716
given to their spouses or their sons or daughters. 
And I said, why in the hell are you wearing that?

41:26.647 --> 41:32.956
Well, the guy started to break down, and he said, 
well, I just wanted to look like a big shot. Jeez. So

41:34.198 --> 41:44.873
I said, well, I said, you know, this really, it's a 
felony for you to wear this on a military uniform.

41:44.893 --> 41:51.001
And I said, if you weren't resigning, I would 
personally prefer charges against you on that.

41:51.402 --> 41:52.283
What do you say to that? Oh, he just didn't have 
anything to say. He just started to break down and

41:55.080 --> 41:56.964
everything. But he resigned and we separated him. 
We had him separated the next day at Fort Myers

41:59.910 --> 42:04.781
about 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Well, 
anyway, we got down to Gordy after I'd

42:20.275 --> 42:23.618
So he was on duty in Washington, and I called him. I 
had known him slightly. And I said, Gordy, would

42:26.662 --> 42:28.503
you come over? I've got a couple of matters I want to 
talk to you about. So he came over, and I just went

42:32.447 --> 42:34.930
right to the point. Was the commanding general 
there, too? No, no. I confronted him myself. He

42:40.816 --> 42:42.918
told me to go ahead and bring him in. So I did. And I 
said, this is a pretty serious matter. And I said,

42:49.385 --> 42:54.734
it's doubly serious because of your relationship 
to General Eisenhower. And I said, you don't have

42:56.597 --> 43:06.454
many options that are very pleasant for you under 
these circumstances because we verified. But

43:06.875 --> 43:09.319
first I asked him if he had any explanation of it. 
And he said, no, I don't have any explanation that I

43:10.421 --> 43:13.907
want to talk about. So when I- Did he admit that he 
didn't go there? No, he didn't admit anything,

43:18.017 --> 43:23.082
that he didn't go or anything, or that he did go. So 
when I got all through, I said, you can resign right

43:24.544 --> 43:29.109
now, no problem. You'll be a veteran, and you can 
resign with honor and everything. And if we kick

43:34.774 --> 43:44.164
you out, it'll be without honor and without 
dishonor, if you determine to fight it. He

43:45.072 --> 43:50.297
hesitated a little bit and then he looked me right 
in the eye and he says, we will fight it. He used the

43:51.198 --> 43:54.021
expression, we will fight it. And I said, okay, 
that's fine if that's your decision. I said, think

43:57.084 --> 44:04.030
about it because tomorrow we'll process the 
papers to G1, Department of the Army. The action

44:05.332 --> 44:11.738
won't be taken at this level, it'll be taken at the 
Pentagon level of G1. So as soon as he left, I went up

44:13.456 --> 44:16.600
and told the boss. I said, well, the phones are 
probably going to be ringing.

44:22.767 --> 44:25.470
But he said, well, I'll tell you. I've talked. He 
told me. I knew who the G1 was at that time. Ted

44:29.796 --> 44:31.438
Brooks, General Brooks. He said, I've talked to 
Ted Brooks. And Ted said, god damn, bow your neck

44:35.322 --> 44:39.868
and let's purge it. Let's purge ourselves if he's 
guilty. So we prepared what case we had and the

44:44.438 --> 44:51.788
evidence we had, and we sent it forward in about 
two, three days. They and G1 spent, oh, several

44:53.590 --> 45:05.407
weeks preparing and verifying and getting more 
evidence and more statements out of the president

44:53.590 --> 45:05.407
at the university. And even we're going to ask him 
to come down and testify at the board hearing.

45:11.054 --> 45:13.838
And...

45:15.488 --> 45:23.239
The board met to make a long story short and about a 
month or six weeks after and kicked him out. Kicked

45:23.680 --> 45:26.905
him out, yes sir. Well shortly after that I was 
ordered to the Army War College and at Carlisle,

45:26.925 --> 45:39.683
which was an honor to be nominated to go to the War 
College. And while I was at the War College I got a

45:40.965 --> 45:44.230
call

45:49.812 --> 45:50.415
very well. And he said, and he had been drinking, I 
know, he said,
