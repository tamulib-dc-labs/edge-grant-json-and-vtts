two, three.

00:12.250 --> 00:17.695
Testing some more, testing some more on the 12th of 
February, testing.

00:20.699 --> 00:25.984
Testing a second time, testing a second time on 
February 12.

00:28.567 --> 00:29.368
W.D. Schultz.

00:32.988 --> 00:38.435
This is February 12, and we're in the heart of the 
Evans Library now. In fact, inside what once was

00:39.657 --> 00:42.801
the Engineering Library. I have the honor and 
pleasure of recording the memories of W.D.

00:49.570 --> 00:57.561
Scotes, that's S-C-O-A-T-E-S,

00:49.570 --> 00:57.561
Bill Scotes to his many friends. Mr. Scotes, to 
introduce you and your family to anybody that will

00:58.655 --> 01:11.906
hear this tape or read the transcription, 
describe your family, when they got here, where,

00:58.655 --> 01:11.906
what was their background before they came to 
College Station. Where did your mom and dad grow up

01:13.868 --> 01:17.892
and where did your dad go to school? Well, what we 
call the Scotes, the United States Scotes family

01:17.912 --> 01:27.700
came was brought to Milwaukee, Wisconsin

01:28.304 --> 01:47.595
by his—by

01:28.304 --> 01:47.595
a cousin of

02:09.530 --> 02:35.638
The

02:09.530 --> 02:35.638
Scopes family was brought to Milwaukee by a 50-ton 
boat from Ramsgate, England across the Atlantic

02:37.576 --> 02:53.834
to the St. Lawrence River, down the St. Lawrence 
River, to the canal up in the lakes, and to

02:37.576 --> 02:53.834
Milwaukee. He brought the entire family of 
Richard William Scotes, who was born in 1818. And

03:01.203 --> 03:04.967
they were Englishman from Ramsgate, England, 
which is on the mouth of the Thames River. And they

03:14.909 --> 03:28.123
were brought here by Francis, Samuel Francis 
Coates, who was a seaman, had that 50-ton boat.

03:28.143 --> 03:33.469
They also brought the family of Sophie, which was 
William Scote's

03:33.888 --> 03:57.221
wife, and they, that family, that man was a tailor, 
and they lived right downtown in what is now

03:33.888 --> 03:57.221
Milwaukee. And your dad was born when? He was born 
in This

04:04.162 --> 04:21.401
is all the family they brought. See, another thing 
on this thing here. This line number It starts off

04:32.782 --> 04:36.307
with an S for Scotes. Then it'll turn to a numeral. 
And then it'll turn back to a letter. Because the

04:42.115 --> 04:54.333
Scotes family, Richard, he had a Richard William 
and a William Richard and a William Richard and so

04:42.115 --> 04:54.333
on down the line. But your dad grew up in Milwaukee? 
No, he grew up in Crown Point. Where? Crown Point,

05:03.670 --> 05:04.992
Indiana. How do you spell Crown Point? Crown 
Point. Oh, Crown Point. Crown Point. Yes, Crown

05:10.000 --> 05:10.641
Point. And what did his father do for a living? He 
was a witcher.

05:17.591 --> 05:18.753
And then... He was one... He was...

05:26.140 --> 05:45.348
His

05:26.140 --> 05:45.348
father was named William Richard Schoes. He was 
born on December the 17th,

05:53.917 --> 05:56.700
1852, in Ramsgate, England. So that's your 
grandfather? That, yeah, that's my grandfather.

06:02.065 --> 06:03.526
No, my great-grandfather. Oh. Yeah, it's dad's 
father. Oh, yeah. And they, they were at Richard

06:09.171 --> 06:19.260
William. How big was Crown, was Crown Point? It was 
a pretty good-sized town. It was, it's about 50

06:24.173 --> 06:37.869
miles south of the end of Lake Michigan.

06:38.249 --> 06:39.170
It's right up there. Up in northern Indiana. Yeah, 
northwestern Indiana. And your dad went to public

06:43.635 --> 06:45.677
school there? Well, he married Emmeline Townsend 
Coffin. No, he, yeah. Is that your dad or your

06:55.225 --> 06:56.848
grandfather? That's my dad. Your dad. No, no, 
that's, that's his, that's his father. Okay.

07:06.782 --> 07:08.083
William Richard Scotes. His father married an 
Emmeline Townsend Coughlin. We called her

07:12.490 --> 07:13.671
grandmother. That's the way we knew her. And she 
was married to a Coughlin, Scotes. She was married

07:21.562 --> 07:23.425
later to a Charles W. King in 1889

07:24.080 --> 07:39.843
and later was married to a Thomas Kearney, 1892.

07:44.149 --> 07:51.640
But, and she lost one boy, the oldest boy, Harry, 
who died of gangrene.

07:55.421 --> 07:58.965
Stuck a pair of scissors in his leg. So your dad went 
to school there in Crown Point? Only to the fourth

08:05.711 --> 08:07.033
grade.

08:11.577 --> 08:18.724
And then he traveled with

08:20.088 --> 08:35.928
The Tierneys were in New

08:20.088 --> 08:35.928
Hampshire, Concord, New Hampshire. That's your 
father with the Tierneys? Yeah,

08:38.591 --> 08:46.821
my grandmother married a Tierney, so there's a 
half-brother. call him Harry William Scotes. He

08:51.964 --> 08:54.608
had his name changed from Tierney to Scotes. And so 
they, they landed, they

08:56.610 --> 09:17.938
moved out of

08:56.610 --> 09:17.938
Milwaukee to a little town called Oak Creek, which 
is in the south, south part of, uh, Milwaukee

09:18.323 --> 09:24.270
County. And through the years there was always a, a 
clan of somebody that was skinned to us in that

09:25.931 --> 09:33.420
town. And that's where, uh,

09:34.821 --> 09:41.649
well, wait a minute. The reason the Scots had 
gotten mixed up in it was that, um, Grandmother

09:48.057 --> 09:59.176
Schultz was a very opinionated woman and took care 
of a lot of people. Matter of fact, she was the first

09:59.497 --> 10:13.761
woman that ever had a,

09:59.497 --> 10:13.761
what do you call it, an expensive drug pharmacist? 
She was the first woman that ever had a father in the

10:14.669 --> 10:21.517
state of Illinois, Indiana.

10:24.000 --> 10:42.702
And she had a

10:24.000 --> 10:42.702
younger sister that was,

10:24.000 --> 10:42.702
she had a younger sister that was very sickly. and

10:44.453 --> 11:09.388
she would come up from Crown Point to this little 
town of Goat Creek and to tend to her sister and

10:44.453 --> 11:09.388
that's where she married, that's where she met the 
Scotes family. So that's the joining of the The

11:12.820 --> 11:18.328
Coffin and the Scotes family was through that.

11:23.035 --> 11:35.112
They

11:23.035 --> 11:35.112
lived there about a year, and then they all moved 
back to Clown Point. But my father never, Daniel

11:35.352 --> 11:40.560
Scotes never went beyond the fourth grade. And 
then what did he do for a living, your dad? well he

11:44.022 --> 12:13.084
was a kid and i don't know what he did there for a 
living uh oh he had to attend

11:44.022 --> 12:13.084
the grandmother had married this uh dr charles 
king

11:44.022 --> 12:13.084
and he was a doctor and dad had to take care of the 
horses and the carriages for him

12:20.388 --> 12:33.306
So they finally moved to

12:20.388 --> 12:33.306
New Hampshire.

12:34.848 --> 12:35.969
What was the big town? Manchester.

12:39.895 --> 12:41.177
They finally moved up there. And then Thomas 
Tierney left them. In 1900, he left my grandmother

12:49.193 --> 12:56.540
and her children. I see there's Daniel, there's 
Richard, and Bessie, and Harry. Four of them. Left

13:04.066 --> 13:09.591
them destitute in Manchester.

13:12.174 --> 13:13.715
I mean destitute. And so a woman, Townsend, See, 
Grandmother was related to the Coffins and the

13:20.311 --> 13:41.215
Townsends out of Maine, and one of them came, she 
was living in Boston, and she arranged one to move

13:20.311 --> 13:41.215
down to what they called South Boston. Okay. In 
the, and was, and that's where the stayed for a

13:50.804 --> 14:19.579
while and in 1900 uh grandmother farmed her 
children out

13:50.804 --> 14:19.579
to her uh

13:50.804 --> 14:19.579
her family she was a she was a coffin one of So who did 
your dad get farmed out to? Her brother. He had a

14:26.442 --> 14:31.688
farm at Scott City, Kansas. He was sent there. 
1900. Where is Scott City? It's in the western half

14:38.555 --> 14:41.298
of it. They raised horses. Way out on the prairie. 
And Joe, your dad would have been about what age

14:44.922 --> 14:48.826
then? Seventeen. Okay. and so they

14:51.689 --> 15:20.498
he was out there in 1900 and they raised those 
horses out there apparently most all sizes I mean

14:51.689 --> 15:20.498
all breeds all breeds of horses they had some 
Clydesdales out there they had the Morgans out

14:51.689 --> 15:20.498
there and daddy daddy had to take them on the train 
back to Connecticut where they sold them. He rode

15:26.058 --> 15:28.040
the train with the horses. And that's what, and 
people don't realize it now, that's what the

15:29.702 --> 15:34.507
caboose was for. Did you know that? Caboose was to- 
To haul animals? No, to haul people that cared for

15:41.474 --> 15:44.337
them. Oh, oh, oh, on a freight train. On a freight 
train. Caboose, we used to have them. function of

15:51.427 --> 16:12.793
that was to haul the people that were on the train 
that had something to do like carrying for horses

15:51.427 --> 16:12.793
or carrying for ice and vegetables or fowl.

16:13.594 --> 16:18.160
They shipped a lot of fowl in those days. were 
shipped out of western Kansas. One of my uncles

16:23.371 --> 16:28.879
told me that he killed 470 of those ducks at one 
time. And shipped them to Kansas City. And how long

16:33.366 --> 16:36.791
did your dad do that, work on the farm? I don't

16:37.672 --> 16:48.028
know a great deal about what was there, other than 
that, what I told you. But someone had helped him

16:48.886 --> 16:57.396
with his schooling. At that point in time, I 
understood it was

16:57.816 --> 17:09.951
some school in Davenport, Iowa. I don't have any 
other recollection of that. The next thing Dad did

17:13.054 --> 17:17.880
was he went to Ames, Iowa, and He passed the 
entrance examinations in 1906. To go to Iowa

17:21.860 --> 17:23.743
State. Now, there's a gap there, see? I really 
don't know a whole lot about it. He wasn't very,

17:29.873 --> 17:37.466
very close with his mouth about that. But then he 
went to Ames. He went three years as a civil

17:41.913 --> 17:45.218
engineer. from 1906 to 1909, and in 1909 they 
offered,

17:47.003 --> 18:12.876
they brought, they brought Mr. Dr. Davison from 
the University of Nebraska to Ames and formed the

17:47.003 --> 18:12.876
Ag Engineering Department, and they gave they 
asked him, they asked dad if he wanted to change to

18:13.160 --> 18:23.913
ag engineering, he'd take this special course 
that they had and he'd get a degree in ag

18:13.160 --> 18:23.913
engineering, which he did. So he was more like a 
civil than he was, but he, he, of course he had the

18:25.975 --> 18:41.293
experience of being on that farm out there, 
because that was a rough time out there then, even

18:25.975 --> 18:41.293
then. Did he ever say what he was hoping to be 
professionally when he got out of college? No, no.

18:51.375 --> 18:56.261
He just took off and made his own. And then he was 
offered a position as head of the Ag Engineering

18:56.521 --> 19:09.357
Department at Mississippi State in 1910.

19:12.155 --> 19:26.234
And my mother, who is...

19:12.155 --> 19:26.234
Where did they meet? She was in Iowa State also. Oh, 
okay. She went three years. In 1910, she stayed

19:33.123 --> 19:36.647
out. And Ms. Mary Eleanor Lamb... She was raised 
right out of Illinois, which is halfway between

19:40.538 --> 19:54.600
Rockford and Freeport in the northern part of 
Illinois, on a farm. She was raised on a farm, a big

19:54.780 --> 19:58.546
farm. And so they married, and she went to... At 
Thanksgiving time, she went down to... St. Louis,

20:10.559 --> 20:15.466
and he went up to St. Louis, and they got married. 
And so then he started his professional degree,

20:17.649 --> 20:23.257
his professional from then on. Over at 
Mississippi State? Yeah. And as the war came on,

20:26.462 --> 20:37.798
Mississippi State, and also A&M right here, we had 
to train kids to drive trucks, take care of trucks.

20:45.302 --> 20:46.423
Was that part of his duty? That was part of his duty. 
And they trained over there. And he got his

20:53.091 --> 21:02.122
half-brother, Harry.

21:04.345 --> 21:07.228
My grandmother couldn't control his 
half-brother. And so he sent him to

21:08.390 --> 21:28.092
Dan Scotes and Albert Lamb at the University

21:08.390 --> 21:28.092
of Mississippi.

21:28.112 --> 21:28.853
Mississippi State. Mississippi State. What's 
the name of that town? Starkville. Starkville.

21:37.077 --> 21:43.065
And he turned, Harry turned into a good mechanic. 
And he was the one that helped Dan with the training

21:43.085 --> 21:49.654
of all those soldiers.

21:53.359 --> 22:05.616
But what happened was that the governor of 
Mississippi would take it upon himself when some

22:06.423 --> 22:17.560
man would make

22:06.423 --> 22:17.560
something he didn't like, and they'd go up there 
and fire him. And Dad didn't like that political

22:17.580 --> 22:21.146
end of it. And so he was offered the job here at A&M. 
In 1919. Do you have any idea what pay he got when he

22:28.377 --> 22:31.862
came? 1900. 1900 for 12 months? there was 
something about that. So he evidently knew that

22:38.315 --> 23:03.548
quite a while because he went to, when we were, we 
normally went to Mother's Place in Illinois

22:38.315 --> 23:03.548
during the summertime and they had some time off 
and we'd normally go up there and

23:04.203 --> 23:18.020
In 1919, he went to the factory for a Huffmobile and 
bought a big sedan. Not a sedan, no, a touring car. A

23:22.245 --> 23:23.246
big touring car. That was a fancy car. Yeah, yeah. A 
great big devil. So when we—when they— He finished

23:34.628 --> 23:41.496
his duties at Starkville, and we all boarded that 
car. Not only did we bring—we had five of us, you

23:42.697 --> 23:46.902
know. We had Dad, Mama, and three children. We had 
another family, Martin, that had a man, his wife,

23:53.168 --> 24:01.918
and a little boy. Were all of you in the Hupmobile? 
We were all in the Hupmobile. And you drove it from

24:06.797 --> 24:08.939
Starkville? We drove it from Starkville, and we 
got to Baton Rouge. And we started across, that day

24:18.808 --> 24:25.694
we started across west out of Baton Rouge. And 
about late in the afternoon, And the roads were

24:30.772 --> 24:35.499
getting awful terrible, just plumb terrible. And 
so he,

24:37.041 --> 24:56.610
lo and behold, on the north side of the road, this 
plantation appeared,

24:37.041 --> 24:56.610
just like the movies have it. There was a road going 
up there, and there were trees on both sides, and a

24:58.649 --> 25:04.697
big old house sitting back in the back end of it. 
That's what it looked like. And so we stopped, and

25:08.963 --> 25:18.857
we drove up in there, and he said we could go ask 
about the road ahead and so forth. And the lady

25:19.678 --> 25:23.924
greeted him and said, you're not going anywhere. 
You're staying here tonight.

25:28.180 --> 25:33.948
like a bed and breakfast, they put all of us up in 
that big old house. And we stayed there. And the

25:36.571 --> 25:42.519
next day, we drove back to

25:36.571 --> 25:42.519
Baton Rouge. And then we had to stay in Baton Rouge 
one day, because Dad had to make arrangements to

25:43.641 --> 25:51.792
ship that car to Houston. There were no transport 
across that. No bridge across the river. No, just

25:56.868 --> 26:00.113
no road at all. And that storm, I think it's the 
storm of 1919 out of Corpus, hurt him and put enough

26:01.355 --> 26:14.013
water in there. Because when we boarded that 
train, we were up there, and I can see it yet. That's

26:21.164 --> 26:24.529
just a continuous storm. built up with none but 
railroad tracks on it all the way down, just as far

26:24.779 --> 26:29.724
as you could see. Now you were five years, this 
1919? Six years old. Well I just went on and on. And

26:40.655 --> 26:47.222
so we got to Houston and then we got some train 
tickets and came on up here. So the car was shipped

26:47.603 --> 26:49.785
all the way here? No, it was shipped to Houston. To 
Houston, okay. And later we went. Oh, later you got

26:54.411 --> 26:55.472
it. Later we obtained it. It wasn't a special trip 
down there to obtain it. And the road between here

27:03.421 --> 27:06.225
and Houston wasn't anything to take. As a matter of 
fact, there were only three pieces of pavement in

27:06.265 --> 27:14.975
this county. Really? Where were they? Well, if you 
want, there was north of Main Street and Bryan was

27:20.973 --> 27:23.616
paved. There was a road from, from Bryan to the 
college, paved, just like it is. Was it Old College

27:31.586 --> 27:33.088
Road? Old College Road. And you'd come up there and 
get next to the railroad and go down there to Boyd's

27:36.312 --> 27:40.777
Corner. That was called Boyd's Corner, and then 
you went back up to Northgate, and you could enter

27:41.679 --> 27:48.567
the college. One went straight on. It never 
existed. Where was the third one, the third

27:51.880 --> 27:55.524
pavement? It was in a mile of track, a mile of 
concrete across the bow. It was right there where

28:06.296 --> 28:14.806
you get ready to cross the Navasota. Oh, oh, oh. 
down south yeah when you went in you came off the

28:17.150 --> 28:37.605
came off this and you went down into the bog because 
now the old highway is on the west side was the west

28:17.150 --> 28:37.605
side following the railroad yeah uh almost to 
navasota well yeah yeah Yeah, you had to cross

28:39.357 --> 28:43.921
there right there before you got to the river. 
There was a bridge on the river, but it was on the

28:44.282 --> 28:46.824
east side. So you had to crawl up over the top of the 
tracks and cross the track and keep on going. You

28:54.871 --> 28:59.696
went to Navasota, you didn't go to the new route. So 
that's where that came in. And there were three

29:03.680 --> 29:05.962
paces of pavement, and that was it. All right, 
describe... the campus as you earliest remember

29:08.737 --> 29:12.521
it. What was it like when you... Well, it was just a 
square piece of property like this. You had, you

29:18.047 --> 29:25.776
came into it at Boyd's Corner, which is a, which is 
an underpass now. Mm-hmm. Boyette's. Mm-hmm.

29:30.481 --> 29:32.103
That's the University Drive. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Used 
to have to climb all the crime. You had to climb On

29:39.382 --> 29:49.494
that railroad, you'd have to

29:39.382 --> 29:49.494
climb 20, 25 feet up an incline to go over the 
railroad. So it was hard to drive a wagon across it?

29:52.457 --> 29:56.182
Hard to drive anything. But it was there. And so 
that road was a gravel road. There were no

30:05.012 --> 30:07.515
pavements, I remember. It went to the corner on 
where Texas is now. That was gravel. There was a

30:15.780 --> 30:21.226
gravel road that went down Texas to the Shiloh.

30:22.167 --> 30:26.812
That was a fraternal club and a church. And they had 
a cemetery, which is now called the State

30:28.734 --> 30:35.341
Cemetery. Was there a road on the south side of the 
campus? No. Where Jersey Street used to be? No,

30:42.281 --> 30:44.664
there were not. And east of what is now Texas Avenue 
was just open land, wasn't it? It was just open

30:49.870 --> 30:50.851
land. There was no road there, except for this one 
gravel road down the property line on the east side

30:51.051 --> 31:03.245
of it. That was the only place there was to go. All 
right, and what buildings were there on the campus

31:06.997 --> 31:11.382
that were most noticeable? Main building. All of 
the, the entire thing faced the railroad. So the

31:20.093 --> 31:22.936
academic building was here at that time. With a 
door.

31:27.442 --> 31:32.768
From there west, it was just about.
