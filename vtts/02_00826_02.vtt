WEBVTT

00:01.617 --> 00:03.600
I had to go about the sprayers and everything. Why 
don't you go ahead and tell me a little bit more

00:03.620 --> 00:09.207
about that and how y'all treated the boll weevil? 
Well, that's about the... We didn't have very good

00:10.089 --> 00:16.017
luck with the boll weevils. We still have the boll 
weevils. You take the cotton region, but we live

00:20.643 --> 00:28.013
with them anyway. And as the price of cattle went 
up, take for instance, I owned the gin and of course

00:29.242 --> 00:40.952
we didn't make, so got to where we didn't make too 
much cotton. The gin went down, went out. We just

00:43.274 --> 00:50.961
discontinued the gin and then we went into living 
of raising more livestock. And as livestock had

00:50.981 --> 00:58.708
their ups and downs, the cattle prices would go 
down and go up as they do today. We raised lots of

00:59.448 --> 01:03.292
turkeys in our community here. Well, what did 
y'all do? Take the turkeys to market and sell them?

01:08.818 --> 01:10.640
We had a good market for turkeys. There was a good 
market all over the state for turkeys. And every

01:14.103 --> 01:24.794
farm home would have eight or nine turkey hens and 
raise eight or ten turkeys apiece. And they'd eat

01:24.814 --> 01:28.358
grasshoppers. They fed off of grasshoppers? They 
fed off of grasshoppers. I had ten turkey hens and I

01:32.428 --> 01:45.180
raised, I had a hundred turkeys, young turkeys and 
they just grazed around and eat the acorns from the

01:32.428 --> 01:45.180
trees in the fall of the year and they eat all the 
grasshoppers. The grasshoppers were especially

01:45.200 --> 01:51.346
bad for the corn, you see, and they'd eat those 
grasshoppers. Later on we began to go more into it

01:52.286 --> 01:57.051
as a commercial deal. We, we We went to feed those 
turkeys, and some places we sold turkey eggs for a

01:58.713 --> 02:09.163
dollar a piece. I had a hundred turkey hens.

02:16.691 --> 02:25.159
We had a big hatchery here in Bryan, a Casemore 
hatchery over there, and we sold them turkeys.

02:27.282 --> 02:28.644
What did y'all feed the turkeys? I mean, as feed, 
what did you use? Grain, mixed feed, regular

02:30.266 --> 02:34.633
turkey feed. There's a big market. They put 
markets all over the state for turkeys. They have

02:39.720 --> 02:48.053
those dressing places where they dress the young 
turkeys, kill them, and you could buy your

02:39.720 --> 02:48.053
Christmas turkeys.

02:51.037 --> 02:55.163
It was a big business for a while, then it died down.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.720
We went more into the cattle business later on. 
Well, you mentioned, you know, y'all quit using

03:01.962 --> 03:04.924
the gin and everything. Do you remember the 
purchase, the first purchase of new pieces of

03:04.944 --> 03:11.190
equipment, you know, like cultivators and stuff 
like that? Can you remember the days that y'all...

03:12.751 --> 03:15.614
I didn't buy no... I bought...

03:15.914 --> 03:25.723
We used horses and mules at the time I was first 
there and we had cultivators what we call walking

03:26.497 --> 03:50.007
cultivators and then later on they began to be 
mechanized and and they have the big tractors and

03:26.497 --> 03:50.007
things like that and they raised lots of land I mean 
raised lots of cotton and corn in the browser's

03:26.497 --> 03:50.007
bottoms and the creek bottoms.

03:50.493 --> 03:52.616
Did the drought of, wasn't there a drought in 1925? 
Yes. That you said, did that affect your life

03:53.617 --> 03:56.100
greatly? Oh yes, oh yes. Well how'd y'all manage to 
get along then? Well we, we, trouble was to have, we

03:59.123 --> 04:11.878
had a well and we used, drained by the barrel, used 
by the barrel of water and that's how we all would

03:59.123 --> 04:11.878
get that day until it seeped back in there. You had 
to be pretty close. We lost lots of cows. Well, was

04:20.075 --> 04:26.865
there, when you were growing up, you know, as a 
young man, was there any motion picture shows

04:20.075 --> 04:26.865
around here? No, no. I don't remember any. We got 
out when we were young folks and chunkwashed nests

04:32.873 --> 04:44.530
and went coon hunting and things like that. When 
you, like you mentioned, going to parties and

04:44.813 --> 04:49.119
everything, what kind of games did y'all play, did 
you? Well, we played those same old games we're

04:49.219 --> 04:52.023
playing today. I don't know. I ain't called a name 
to them. Oh. Go ahead and tell me a few. Let's see. I

05:03.159 --> 05:03.519
don't know. Ring Around the Roses and Dr. Hankship 
and all those things. And we had a game we played

05:09.788 --> 05:12.812
called Snap. We didn't do so much dancing, but we 
did some dancing, too. Then dancing came in. What

05:19.244 --> 05:21.246
did this game, Snap, what did that involve? Well, 
there was a boy and a girl holed up, and then the boy

05:21.266 --> 05:29.076
picked some girl to catch him and run around it, run 
around each other. Oh. Did you ever play that? No,

05:30.218 --> 05:30.879
sir. Did you ever hear it? Where did you read it? San 
Antonio. San Antonio. Wasn't there, in the

05:38.669 --> 05:42.934
county, wasn't there the old San Antonio Road 
is... Yes, it's up above this county up here, the

05:43.353 --> 05:48.458
north end of the county. The old San Antonio Road 
came through there. Was that just a direct route

05:51.401 --> 05:53.703
from San Antonio? It was a direct route through 
there. The early settlers used King's Highway.

06:00.730 --> 06:02.492
They called it the King's Highway. How come? Do you 
know why? No, I don't know. That's just the name

06:07.036 --> 06:08.478
they give it. It's an old San Antonio Road and they 
call it the King's Highway. Do you remember your

06:14.082 --> 06:19.107
father ever traveling on that, or did y'all do 
that? Yeah, I traveled it later on. I didn't travel

06:23.111 --> 06:25.194
it too early. Not in my early days, I didn't travel 
it. But it was a very much popular, a much used road

06:30.219 --> 06:36.345
at that time. See, Texas was, you might say, in 
those early days, it wasn't settled.

06:46.364 --> 06:50.990
Okay, well, did y'all, so then as vehicles, y'all 
used wagons and stuff like that? Wagons and

06:51.070 --> 06:52.091
buggies. Okay, well, what were some of the common 
problems with the wagons? I mean, did y'all, like,

06:55.195 --> 06:57.478
did the wheels? Well, the wheels, of course, we 
used wagons to raise, pull the cotton, and we used

06:57.578 --> 07:07.811
our soil piece in the paper. Dave made me think, and 
I go back to that. We used oxen, too. We had oxen at

07:11.756 --> 07:13.418
that time. And we had those oxen to use to pull 
cotton and to plow. My, uh, my daddy had a fire yoga

07:18.212 --> 07:25.238
oxen down in the creek bottom where we are still on 
that land over there yet. And they used those oxen

07:26.399 --> 07:29.362
to plow.

07:33.906 --> 07:36.308
And that was mainly how y'all got into town and 
stuff? It was... Well, we went there, we had

07:36.328 --> 07:38.270
buggies. We went in buggies. Oh. Every family had a 
buggy and a horse. And we'd go to town every

07:43.891 --> 07:48.656
Saturday, buy groceries. Did y'all spend all day 
Saturday in town, usually? Oh, not every day. We'd

07:52.901 --> 07:53.882
just go there. You had to go buy groceries and buy 
things and things, just like you do now. Of course,

07:57.746 --> 08:02.511
now you can go there and come back in a few minutes, 
you see, and buy your groceries and car. Well, can

08:04.193 --> 08:09.518
you remember, I mean, has the role of the woman 
changed very much? The female, do you think,

08:09.578 --> 08:12.261
since, I mean? I don't think. too much. They have 
been,

08:14.294 --> 08:26.569
well, they, yes, I don't want to get in the door

08:14.294 --> 08:26.569
as a woman to live. Well,

08:26.649 --> 08:33.017
what was mine and their function? I mean, were 
they? They, they, they cared for the household,

08:33.577 --> 08:38.383
raised children, and raised the families. Do you 
ever remember your mother attending any quilting

08:38.819 --> 08:42.424
days? Yes, we had quilting parties. They had 
quilting parties. I gave a lady up the road here a

08:45.709 --> 08:51.817
pair of old quilting things the other day. I found a 
pair I had in the shed. They usually have quiltings

08:53.720 --> 08:59.528
and quilts. My wife, during that Depression, I 
didn't mention that, during that Depression, the

08:59.588 --> 09:07.780
government gave cotton. And she

09:08.502 --> 09:15.933
taught them how to make mattresses. They'd give 
them cotton, bale after bale. They had the cotton,

09:19.338 --> 09:20.620
you see. And every family in this community, 
nearly all of them that wanted a mattress, which

09:21.281 --> 09:30.714
nearly all of them did, and some of them got three, 
they'd make a mattress. And they could make those

09:31.095 --> 09:33.278
mattresses out of that cotton. They knew how to do 
it. They learned how to do it. The government did

09:37.426 --> 09:38.948
that. Oh, to help the... During the Depression, 
put it during that. Okay, well you mentioned that

09:44.295 --> 09:47.438
your wife was working with the... Yes, she helped 
in all the club work and she was a great worker with

09:47.458 --> 09:54.147
the club women of the county. She was a member of the 
Harvey Community Club and they had this, they had

09:54.187 --> 10:05.661
the parties that meet once a week or something like 
that. and have quilting bees, and have baby

10:06.468 --> 10:12.474
showers.

10:15.177 --> 10:25.347
Well, somebody had mentioned to me that they used 
to hold a dance type thing where the men would all

10:15.177 --> 10:25.347
try to grow their beards up to a certain period, you 
know, and the ladies would come dressed in

10:15.177 --> 10:25.347
colonial dresses. Do you remember anything about 
this? Yeah, they did that for two years. I didn't

10:32.074 --> 10:34.416
have a heavy beard like he's got.

10:37.990 --> 10:43.418
So then for social, y'all just, social life, y'all 
just had parties and stuff like that? Yes, we had

10:43.438 --> 10:49.307
our church and, well they had plenty of 
entertainment for people. They were not hurt for

10:49.367 --> 10:51.250
entertainment. Okay. Do you remember... Played 
ball,

10:53.653 --> 11:07.474
baseball,

10:53.653 --> 11:07.474
basketball,

10:53.653 --> 11:07.474
football, just like the dude did. I got pictures of 
where I played football over at Sam Houston

11:08.686 --> 11:13.294
Normal.

11:16.159 --> 11:21.008
Well do you remember anything like, were there 
ever any really what you would call saloons?

11:21.589 --> 11:22.651
Saloon? Yes. I don't remember there was a saloon. 
We had saloons here in Brown and of course there was

11:24.735 --> 11:31.707
quite a little bit of drinking but nothing.

11:36.293 --> 11:41.761
Well, do you remember anything, I mean, like 
barroom brawls, like they would call them? No, I

11:41.781 --> 11:42.322
don't remember that. I'm kidding, I wouldn't 
think about it.

11:46.668 --> 11:50.934
Which I know they had, all right, of course. But 
Bryan was a very

11:53.177 --> 12:00.387
nice town, one of the quiet towns. It was a college 
town. We had A&M College over there, you see. We

12:05.190 --> 12:09.657
always looked after A&M College, and A&M College 
has looked after us. We've always spoke of Brown as

12:09.898 --> 12:15.968
being a city of schools. We had the Allen Academy 
and several others. We've had good high schools,

12:19.353 --> 12:23.380
good things like that. Well, do you remember any 
certain thing that made the most impact on you?

12:30.412 --> 12:40.101
Anything that happened while you were growing up 
here in Bryan, or anything that influenced you a

12:30.412 --> 12:40.101
whole lot, stands out in your life? Well, one of the 
things that I said, we were busy making a living.

12:48.189 --> 12:51.312
Everybody helped to make a living. Every family 
raised chickens, hogs. Had our own eggs. We had our

12:58.899 --> 13:00.300
own garden. and things like that. So did you, as you 
farmed and was ranching and everything, did you

13:03.793 --> 13:08.921
have any tenant farmers? Yes, I had. One time I had 
six tenant farmers' families. I had houses back

13:18.916 --> 13:22.301
over in the places over there. They're torn down 
now. I had six telephones. Did you, do you ever

13:28.770 --> 13:33.054
recall your grandfather talking about slavery or 
anything? Yes, he had no, I remember that very

13:33.074 --> 13:37.017
distinctly. When they came in here, came to Texas, 
the old slave came with him. And he stayed with him.

13:48.488 --> 13:50.550
And he had slaves back in Alabama. And

13:55.748 --> 13:58.813
They loved the old slaves. The slaves loved the 
master. They didn't have no trouble with him. Do

14:03.842 --> 14:05.926
you happen to recall this slave's name? I'm just 
trying to think of that old slave's name.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.988
I can't think of it. Well, I think it's about run 
through. I think I can ask you, can you think of

14:22.931 --> 14:27.536
anything that you might want to tell me right 
offhand? I can think of anything you want to

14:27.996 --> 14:41.629
just...

14:27.996 --> 14:41.629
And I believe the government is trying to come 
back, come along the same way to try to help people.

14:41.709 --> 14:48.655
They're reducing, they want to reduce taxes

14:41.709 --> 14:48.655
and It would be a great benefit to people that need 
it, you see.
