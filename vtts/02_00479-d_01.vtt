WEBVTT

00:05.650 --> 00:27.251
For example, they'd be sending frantic cables 
from Vietnam for various spare parts when lo and

00:05.650 --> 00:27.251
behold they had maybe a year's supply of them at Cam 
Ranh Bay in a depot that they hadn't identified or

00:05.650 --> 00:27.251
categorized or picked up on their records or what 
have you. And situations like that, just too

00:28.352 --> 00:31.595
numerous to even mention. No kidding. 
Absolutely. Cameron Bay, the stuff would arrive

00:34.810 --> 00:47.477
over there in boxes and they would stack them up and 
put them out in the open, cover them up with

00:34.810 --> 00:47.477
tarpaulins and nobody ever made any effort to 
determine what the hell was under these tarps. Was

00:48.679 --> 00:55.333
it needed, was it in, and even with an 
identification code some of the stuff that was

00:48.679 --> 00:55.333
needed for for aircraft that were out of, off of 
readiness status. Some of the boxes were

01:01.852 --> 01:11.665
imprinted with red dots and this sort of thing to 
indicate priority cargo that was needed for

01:01.852 --> 01:11.665
deadline vehicles or aircraft. We found a lot of 
deadline cargo shipments under these

01:12.286 --> 01:16.331
tarpaulins. The stuff was so marked and There 
should have been immediately when it arrived in

01:20.170 --> 01:26.240
the command and came off of the airplane, it was all 
hauled by air freight over there. It should have

01:26.821 --> 01:34.132
gone right to a point where it was disseminated and 
identified as to who had requisitioned it and what

01:26.821 --> 01:34.132
the purpose was. But those kind of things are just 
due to lack of management attention. And it's a

01:40.302 --> 01:48.034
constant reminder of an old saying that a 
commander that I remember during the war said that

01:48.638 --> 01:54.905
a unit does well only those things that the boss 
checks up on and that's so true. Patton didn't say

01:56.666 --> 02:07.978
that, he's attributed to having said that, but 
originally I think that General Courthouse Lee

01:56.666 --> 02:07.978
said that. He was a rather infamous commander of 
the U.S. service forces under Eisenhower in

02:14.744 --> 02:16.527
Europe. Nobody liked him. He was a very 
high-powered Episcopal lay reader. But he made

02:24.118 --> 02:27.863
that statement, and I think old Courthouse Lee was 
right. Well, anyway, it was a very bad situation,

02:28.805 --> 02:43.266
and the Secretary of Defense's office, I don't 
know who in the Secretary of Defense's office,

02:28.805 --> 02:43.266
said that in connection with this high-winder 
trip we made in 1966, if we could get some shots of

02:43.820 --> 02:50.812
some of these bad examples on movie film. So, when I 
arrived in the command, the deputy commander,

02:51.994 --> 03:05.156
General Abrams, who later was the commander 
general in Vietnam, I told Abe, and I had gone to the

02:51.994 --> 03:05.156
War College with Abe, so I knew him on a first-name 
basis. I told him that SecDef's office wanted me to

03:09.875 --> 03:18.787
wherever I could to put some pictures on film, 
movie film, of some of the logistic problems that

03:09.875 --> 03:18.787
we could help out with. They said fine, so he 
assigned a combat cameraman and a crew of two other

03:19.428 --> 03:26.858
people with our team. And as a matter of fact, we 
took pictures of almost everything. Every time

03:31.665 --> 03:36.051
I'd look up, these guys were taking pictures.

03:37.752 --> 03:45.880
Finally, after it all got done, a 45-minute

03:37.752 --> 03:45.880
edited film was made of the trip. As a matter of 
fact, I've got a copy of it in my personal records.

03:51.865 --> 03:52.446
No kidding. Yes, I have. It's a sound...

03:53.827 --> 03:58.732
No, it's not a soundtrack. I put a soundtrack on it. 
I dubbed a soundtrack in. I went up to Long Island to

04:01.795 --> 04:07.540
the Signal Corps Depot and dubbed in a soundtrack 
on it. So now it does have a soundtrack? Yeah, it

04:09.590 --> 04:10.712
does have a soundtrack. Can I see that movie? Yeah, 
you could. I've got it. It's stored at home, and I

04:17.121 --> 04:25.533
don't have a projector, but I'll arrange some time 
to come down and show it to you. No, why don't you

04:25.553 --> 04:26.915
just send it to me? Okay. Because I have tons of 
projectors at the university. Yeah, I'd really

04:30.920 --> 04:36.889
like to see that film because I teach Vietnam, and 
I'd like to see it for my own edification. Yeah.

04:37.945 --> 04:50.918
Okay, the film, I'm not sure the whole, I know I 
opened the film with a narrative, and maybe, but

04:37.945 --> 04:50.918
there's not sound on every little scene. I'll do 
that. I'll send it to you. I'd love to see it. And it

04:54.562 --> 04:59.486
was, it's, not many horrible examples are shown. 
It wound up, I didn't edit it. I didn't do the

05:02.590 --> 05:04.071
editing. And they didn't show some of the bad 
things that I wanted to show. But it's a pretty good

05:10.107 --> 05:19.903
picture of some

05:10.107 --> 05:19.903
of the depots and the riverine force in Vietnam. 
This was a very, I think one of the most capable

05:19.923 --> 05:26.915
operations in Vietnam was that riverine force. 
And I spent several days with them. Where about? On

05:33.983 --> 05:36.948
the river there, and up and down the river with 
them. Went on patrols with them. Saigon River?

05:39.492 --> 05:40.393
Yeah, yeah. And went on patrols with them. Matter 
of fact, we almost had an accident flying off of one

05:42.877 --> 05:48.585
of those ships. There was a tail rotor on our 
chopper, just barely nicked a mast on the damn

05:48.605 --> 05:54.975
thing. And we'd have gone right in the water if it 
had hit it. But it just scraped it. Because the

06:01.190 --> 06:03.814
pilot was just utterly scared to death. He didn't 
know whether to go ahead and go on and lift off or

06:03.854 --> 06:06.678
what. Because we heard it real loud. But anyway, 
let's get back to Abrams and Westmoreland now. So

06:14.509 --> 06:17.293
Abrams gave me a lot of cooperation. 
Westmoreland, I don't know. I think there's a lot

06:21.693 --> 06:27.059
of truth in what CBS said about Westmoreland. Just 
recently, yeah? Yes, just recently. And

06:30.163 --> 06:33.327
Westmoreland, of course, is very unhappy about 
it. That he falsified some documents. Yeah, and a

06:35.670 --> 06:37.833
lot of people have risen to his defense.

06:41.056 --> 06:48.966
I really felt in 1966, when I was over there, that we 
were going to win this war. that we could win this

06:49.942 --> 07:02.882
war, and I felt, and as do the strategic people, and 
I certainly agree with them, that the failure that

06:49.942 --> 07:02.882
we made, and that Westmoreland made, was not 
insisting. We had enough troops over there to win.

07:05.606 --> 07:09.212
Oh, goodness knows we had enough support over 
there to win. We had enough logistics support.

07:11.956 --> 07:18.666
It's the only war, really, in recent, in all our 
history, and of course, I'm for our troops in the

07:18.865 --> 07:24.171
field and our fighting forces really getting the 
very best of everything. This is the only war where

07:25.433 --> 07:30.579
we went, where Westmoreland wanted to go better 
than first class. You know? He wanted to do better

07:32.141 --> 07:34.204
than first class. And in many respects they did. 
For example, in rations. They, all of Vietnam, the

07:39.470 --> 07:45.177
subsistence was issued in Vietnam on the basis 125 
percent of the authorized ration, they got 25

07:45.730 --> 07:58.564
percent more food per capita in Vietnam than they 
were supposed to get. It was 125 percent of

08:00.286 --> 08:05.372
everything, the ration. And wherever it could be 
done, in other words, even with a unit out in the

08:05.392 --> 08:13.020
bush on patrol, they tried to bring them in 
thermotainers every day, at least one hot meal.

08:19.405 --> 08:30.319
And some unit commanders in some outfits tried, in 
addition to one hot meal, also tried to bring them

08:19.405 --> 08:30.319
ice cream once a day in these thermotainers. And 
they did, they absolutely did, because I was out in

08:31.400 --> 08:43.075
some of the units on patrol and at lunchtime we had 
ice cream and we had hot fried chicken and so forth.

08:43.983 --> 08:52.980
I'll never forget at Da Nang, going in the, at the 
Marine Depot in Da Nang.

08:55.905 --> 09:01.997
The officers club was a beautiful little club they 
built with a huge picture window. You could sit in

09:02.658 --> 09:07.527
the officers club in the evening and watch an 
artillery duel. through the picture window, you

09:07.962 --> 09:16.531
could see the artillery flashes way off in the 
horizon between our forces and the Viet Cong. And

09:18.052 --> 09:29.684
at the briefing I got at Da Nang at this marine 
depot, this young officer, a marine first

09:18.052 --> 09:29.684
lieutenant, I think, or second lieutenant, was 
telling about his ice cream plant. And he said,

09:31.025 --> 09:35.229
we're known as the Howard Johnsons of Vietnam. He 
says, we make and serve daily. eight different

09:38.371 --> 09:40.713
flavors of ice cream. And he then enumerated 
chocolate vanilla, strawberry, pecan, and so

09:42.175 --> 09:49.602
forth. Eight flavors of ice cream. The Howard 
Johnsons of Vietnam. This was in the briefing for a

09:53.887 --> 09:59.492
visiting general officer or an inspection team. 
And the same sort of feeling prevailed

10:00.894 --> 10:05.138
everywhere. You know, that we've got this, we've 
got that, and the best of everything, and it was

10:05.590 --> 10:12.100
better than first class. Of course, life out in the 
bush on patrol and out in the rice paddy and

10:12.140 --> 10:20.393
fighting the comm, there's nothing first class 
about that. And being shot and leeches and

10:20.413 --> 10:24.679
mosquitoes on you and that. But everything else, 
back in the rear areas and the headquarters and the

10:25.469 --> 10:48.642
hotels in Saigon, the officer's club on top of the 
hotel there in Saigon, where you could also see

10:25.469 --> 10:48.642
artillery duels on the horizon at night while 
you're having a charcoal broil steak up there and

10:25.469 --> 10:48.642
all kinds of drinks.

10:51.102 --> 10:56.008
And those sorts of things are directly related to 
command. Directly related to command.

10:58.932 --> 11:08.684
Westmoreland did not utilize in an efficient, 
military, cold-blooded military way the assets

10:58.932 --> 11:08.684
that he had. He did not do it. Can you give him an 
example? Well, all the spare parts and all the

11:14.111 --> 11:20.940
maintenance supplies and everything were there. 
they were there covered up with tarpaulins. He

11:24.438 --> 11:36.416
didn't have somebody out there digging and doing 
this and doing that and expediting maintenance

11:24.438 --> 11:36.416
and keeping all these choppers ready to fly and the 
aircraft ready to fly. There was a large

11:36.456 --> 11:44.848
percentage of our air support aircraft were down 
for maintenance on any given day. A large support

11:44.888 --> 11:50.016
of our helicopters were down for maintenance on a 
given day. and other vehicles and so forth. I think

11:53.665 --> 11:58.172
the maintenance in the riverine force was better 
than any part in Vietnam. And those sort of things

11:59.434 --> 12:06.885
ultimately reflect themselves in combat 
efficiency. When you don't have a force well

12:07.746 --> 12:16.179
maintained and everything that you have is not 
capable to fight, you're not going to fight as

12:07.746 --> 12:16.179
well. And you're not going to fight as 
effectively. What did the Secretary of Defense

12:18.987 --> 12:22.713
say when you handed him your report and the film? 
Well they were, you know, they were a little bit

12:23.834 --> 12:44.927
appalled and shocked and of course a lot of cables 
went back and forth and the command, you know,

12:23.834 --> 12:44.927
always takes a defensive posture and well we had 
some new personnel at Cameron Bay and these things

12:23.834 --> 12:44.927
were missed and we've initiated new procedures to 
do this and do that and so forth. I think in Vietnam

12:45.751 --> 12:50.616
as a whole there were some broad strategic 
decisions. This is my own personal opinion now

12:50.656 --> 12:55.942
that you probably can't lay in Westmoreland's 
lap. But I think that we should have bombed or mined

12:56.683 --> 13:03.691
Haiphong a long, long time before we did. 
Westmoreland would agree with you there. Yeah,

13:06.414 --> 13:13.682
and we should have inflicted interdiction damage 
upon parts of North Vietnam. to preclude them

13:13.932 --> 13:20.319
having the capability to move down into South 
Vietnam.

13:22.021 --> 13:28.108
It was a difficult war because many times you had 
difficulty even identifying your enemy. The con,

13:29.189 --> 13:32.293
you know, wearing their black pajamas and 
everything. It was difficult to even identify

13:32.353 --> 13:35.957
them. And I know even the choppers that I flew 
around in and any general officer, senior officer

13:36.410 --> 13:46.449
for that matter, was always a machine gunner 
sitting in each door. And we would take off and then

13:47.712 --> 13:58.873
rise up immediately at about 1500 feet to get above 
small arms and accurate range before we'd start

13:47.712 --> 13:58.873
across country. and these machine gunners would 
see somebody down there and there was a jungler or a

13:59.005 --> 14:08.795
rice paddy and they weren't real sure whether they 
were calm or not, but they'd fire a burst at them

13:59.005 --> 14:08.795
anyway. Really? Yeah, and I told this one kid one 
day, I said, you sure do have a nimble finger. He

14:16.082 --> 14:19.025
said, well, he said, they look like calm to me. I 
said, well, we're about fifteen, sixteen hundred

14:19.045 --> 14:27.713
feet above them and I can't identify them, but he 
was shooting at them and But I think that these

14:29.363 --> 14:41.960
broad strategic decisions, I think they weren't 
made because there was some fear that the Red

14:29.363 --> 14:41.960
Chinese or the Soviets might intervene in some 
strategic way if we did. I don't believe they would

14:41.980 --> 14:43.843
have. No. I don't believe they would have. But I 
blame Westmoreland for not using what he had

14:46.927 --> 14:51.273
there. And it was millions of tons of military 
equipment and hardware. Could you compare

14:58.658 --> 15:06.389
Westmoreland and the type of man or commander he 
was with that of Creighton Abrams?

15:10.054 --> 15:27.298
Westmoreland was a fancy Dan type of a guy that 
wants to you know be high and mighty and powerful

15:10.054 --> 15:27.298
and look real fancy and real glamour boy and sexy 
type and but he's not a gutty earthy down-to-earth

15:27.835 --> 15:29.077
type individual. I don't think he ever, I don't 
think the average G.I. ever thought very much of

15:32.785 --> 15:35.270
Westmoreland. And they did of Abrams. Did in World 
War II of Abrams and in Vietnam. But uh- Why? Tell me

15:44.548 --> 15:45.590
about Abrams. Tell me about Abrams. You must have 
known him much better. Yeah, I knew him a lot

15:49.805 --> 15:51.648
better. I think when Abrams took over, he had 
inherited an impossible situation. It was almost

15:57.858 --> 16:07.292
beyond rehabilitation or beyond saving. We were 
not going to, we were apparently not going to make

16:07.272 --> 16:14.560
these broad strategic decisions. We finally did 
bomb Hanoi and some of those places rather

16:14.640 --> 16:20.747
extensively, but it was a little too late then. 
Abrams inherited, he improved the logistic

16:20.787 --> 16:30.397
situation tremendously in a short period of time. 
He really did that.

16:36.027 --> 16:44.204
But we were pretty far down the pike of being an 
unwanted, unwinnable war by the time Creighton

16:36.027 --> 16:44.204
Abrams took over. If Creighton Abrams had gone in 
there when Westmoreland did, I think we'd have won

16:44.926 --> 16:50.037
that war. Well, now let's answer the big question. 
How could we have won that war, or why did we lose? We

16:57.003 --> 17:12.487
lost that war because our commanders in the field, 
our highest commanders in the field, did not exert

16:57.003 --> 17:12.487
the all-out maximum effort that they should have 
exerted. And we lost that war also because the will

17:13.709 --> 17:20.580
of our country was really not for winning that war. 
with all the dissension at home and I think that the

17:21.539 --> 17:46.969
dissension at home affected the strategic 
planning and decisions that were not made about

17:21.539 --> 17:46.969
some of these things early in the war to bomb and 
mine Haiphong Harbor and bomb Hanoi or bomb the

17:21.539 --> 17:46.969
communication lines and other things. I think 
that the problems at home the unwelcomeness of the

17:49.973 --> 17:54.559
war and the unpopularity of the war. And then I 
think, and you probably have heard a lot of people

17:56.221 --> 18:16.909
say this,

17:56.221 --> 18:16.909
I think that the war became extremely unpopular 
and unpalatable to every American, including the

17:56.221 --> 18:16.909
military Americans, because of the exposure of 
the war. the media exposure of the war. We had it in

18:20.657 --> 18:29.937
our bedrooms, in our living rooms, and in our 
dining rooms at every newscast period of every

18:20.657 --> 18:29.937
waking day. And we only saw the good, the bad side of 
the war. We panned in on the guys burning down the

18:35.043 --> 18:45.696
little villages and the Viet Cong refuge 
hoochies. When they'd root them out and find them,

18:45.716 --> 18:50.783
then they'd burn them down so they wouldn't move in 
and occupy them again. And we saw the little old

18:50.803 --> 18:58.152
ladies in the, holding the naked babies, sitting 
in the rice paddies crying. Now this is what the

18:58.132 --> 19:00.794
news guys took the pictures of. And you give 
anybody those pictures over and over and over

19:02.296 --> 19:07.880
again. If we had had the same exposure to World War 
II that we had to Vietnam, it would have been just as

19:07.920 --> 19:23.454
unpopular, maybe far more unpopular. If we had had 
in our living rooms and in our dining rooms the

19:28.085 --> 19:42.443
pictures of the refugees on the Autobahns in 
Germany when the 3rd Armored Division was going by

19:28.085 --> 19:42.443
and the refugees stand there holding out their 
hands and begging for food and all this sort of

19:28.085 --> 19:42.443
thing. Why, the American people would have just 
wretched. And if we had seen some of the other

19:46.768 --> 19:56.420
things that went on, we didn't have any of this in 
Vietnam, but I don't know if anybody there

19:46.768 --> 19:56.420
mentioned it. There was a hell of a lot of looting in 
World War II on the part of the American soldiers.

20:01.840 --> 20:09.671
If we'd have had a few pictures of that on the 
movies, on the television screens, this would

20:01.840 --> 20:09.671
have made it a very unpopular war. I'm not saying 
that the press should not have been allowed in

20:10.813 --> 20:18.865
Vietnam, but the exposure, it did the thing. We see 
the same thing now in Beirut today. You see the same

20:22.690 --> 20:23.711
thing. And the majority of American people and I 
think it's generally a correct assumption, have

20:27.822 --> 20:37.437
assumed that Israelis are the vicious aggressor 
in this thing. And I think Begin is a little bit on

20:38.719 --> 20:47.333
the madman side, or the side that he thinks he's the 
little Napoleon. But if we'd have had the same

20:48.154 --> 20:53.543
exposure in World War II or World War I, that we had 
in Vietnam, it would have been just as unpopular.

20:57.327 --> 21:04.215
And God knows it would have been, the Civil War 
would have been far more unpopular if we'd have had

20:57.327 --> 21:04.215
the same exposure. The same media exposure. But I 
think we could have won Vietnam if we'd have had a

21:07.799 --> 21:14.966
Patton in command in Vietnam. If we'd have had 
somebody with the mentality of Patton. And Abrams

21:19.611 --> 21:22.855
did have the mentality of a Patton. because Abrams 
was one of Patton's young, bright, brilliant

21:23.425 --> 21:32.076
combat commanders in World War II. But 
Westmoreland was a fancy Dan. I don't know that he

21:38.985 --> 21:52.302
falsified the reports of the Kong back to the JCS, 
but I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he thought it

21:38.985 --> 21:52.302
was enhancing his position. He might have. I don't 
trust the guy. I really don't. Okay, let's talk

21:57.846 --> 22:03.476
about your last job then, command of the Defense 
Personnel Support Center. Yeah. And what impact

22:04.478 --> 22:07.544
did Vietnam have on that? Tremendous impact. Tell 
me about it. Because the buildup, of course,

22:09.928 --> 22:15.218
increased our requirements for everything, food 
and clothing. I told you yesterday about the

22:15.417 --> 22:42.420
problems we had to get coverage of equipment and 
particularly clothing and combat equipment and

22:15.417 --> 22:42.420
combat clothing and tentage and all this sort of 
thing and even some medical items for the support

22:15.417 --> 22:42.420
of the troops in Vietnam where we had to because, 
and I relate this to what we've just been talking

22:15.417 --> 22:42.420
about, the unpopularity of the war No legitimate, 
very few legitimate American businesses would

22:43.160 --> 22:55.339
even bid on the requirements of the military at the 
start of the Vietnam buildup. Well, do you think

22:55.599 --> 23:05.675
that was because of what you said yesterday, the 
excellent economy, or was that because the war was

22:55.599 --> 23:05.675
unpopular in 1966? I think it was a combination of 
both. It was a combination of both. I think the war

23:10.683 --> 23:14.748
was unpopular and becoming more so every day. 
Plus, a booming economy. And the businesses

23:18.153 --> 23:23.360
didn't want to interfere with their 
relationships, with their customers.

23:23.740 --> 23:24.641
Everything was good. And the Johnson 
administration had not put us on a wartime basis.

23:32.872 --> 23:35.276
We wanted to have guns and butter, too. He said that 
in a statement, I think. And so the military was at

23:38.628 --> 23:50.042
the mercy of the will and the desire of business to 
help support the Vietnam effort. It really, it's

23:50.983 --> 24:00.836
hard for me to say this, but I will say it, I think it 
slowed down our effort several months. It slowed

24:01.537 --> 24:02.418
it down. I know it slowed down the training in the 
reception centers in the United States. Because

24:08.783 --> 24:10.145
they did not have the supplies. Because we did not 
have. They were not able to bring in as many people

24:11.407 --> 24:18.677
as quickly as they did because they didn't have 
clothing for them. And then we went out on, they

24:19.878 --> 24:22.602
went out on the open market. The reception centers 
were given local authority to go out into Sears and

24:22.642 --> 24:35.179
Robux and buy an army surplus stores and buy khaki 
uniforms and fatigue clothing to have for the raw

24:35.429 --> 24:39.195
recruits when they came in to start basic 
training. And we just didn't have it. And because

24:42.660 --> 24:45.624
nobody would bid on it. And we had to finally resort 
to this wartime authority that was passed in World

24:45.644 --> 24:59.785
War II of directed procurement, where we sent 
actually telegrams saying, you are hereby

24:45.644 --> 24:59.785
directed to manufacture such and such. So it was a 
combination of the booming civilian economy and

25:05.888 --> 25:15.381
the growing unpopularity of the war that made the 
logistic support of the training and the support

25:05.888 --> 25:15.381
effort almost an impossibility.

25:17.704 --> 25:19.186
Why'd you retire from that job? That seems like it 
was one of the most important jobs that you had

25:19.226 --> 25:25.674
throughout your entire career. Right. I would 
have had to retire In December of that year,

25:31.589 --> 25:36.177
because of... December of 66? Yeah, of 67, because 
of a requirement if you were five years in grade and

25:36.258 --> 25:43.771
you had not been promoted. So if I had been promoted 
to my second star, I would not have retired. But I

25:50.924 --> 25:55.673
was, I would have been five years in grade, And 
while it didn't bother me really, my dedication to

25:56.277 --> 26:09.457
the job, there was a certain amount of

25:56.277 --> 26:09.457
bad feeling of not having been promoted. And even 
though I was doing the job and everybody was, you

26:09.477 --> 26:21.154
know, saying what a great guy you were and great job 
you're doing and so forth and so on. And this offer,

26:21.961 --> 26:36.880
the chairman of Scott, whom I got to know there in 
Philadelphia, I served in an honorary capacity on

26:21.961 --> 26:36.880
the Board of Directors of the Greater 
Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce when I was a

26:21.961 --> 26:36.880
commander. I got that when I was in Northeast 
Philly at DISC. He offered me this job at Scott to

26:42.006 --> 26:50.837
bring me in as a corporate vice president at the 
corporate level and with... operational

26:51.458 --> 27:16.521
responsibility for the container division and 
the foam division and also with some

26:51.458 --> 27:16.521
responsibility in their research and i had 
consulted and given them some advice on a

26:51.458 --> 27:16.521
invention they had because of my knowledge with 
jet fuel scott made a polyurethane foam that they

26:51.458 --> 27:16.521
could control the pore size on the foam And they did 
some experiment with it in race car tanks to pack

27:17.581 --> 27:27.894
the tank of a race car with this foam. And you could 
take a 100-gallon tank and pack this Scott foam in

27:28.454 --> 27:33.881
it with 10-4ths to the inch. And you could fill that 
100-gallon tank, even though the tank was filled

27:34.682 --> 27:42.111
with this foam, you could fill that tank with 97 
gallons of fuel. You only lose 3% because of this

27:42.672 --> 27:45.495
foam. If that tank were ruptured like in an 
accident that happened at Indianapolis at the

27:45.796 --> 28:05.394
start of the race three or four years before that, 
several cars caught on fire and a couple of guys

27:45.796 --> 28:05.394
were killed and so forth, you wouldn't have an 
explosion because the fire would not, the

27:45.796 --> 28:05.394
explosion would not move through that foam. It 
would suppress an explosion. And then I surmised

28:08.617 --> 28:14.622
and told them that I thought the same thing would 
happen in an aircraft tank. If you'd pack that

28:14.973 --> 28:42.027
foam, I told Harry Dunning at a dinner party one 
night in mid-66, why don't you have your guys, they

28:14.973 --> 28:42.027
were working with Firestone, why don't you have 
them pack a wingtip tank of an airplane, pack it

28:14.973 --> 28:42.027
with cotton foam, fill it about half full of jet 
fuel, don't fill it all away, fill it about half

28:14.973 --> 28:42.027
fuel so there's vapor space on top of it, and I knew 
how explosive that was. and fire a 30 caliber or a 50

28:42.445 --> 28:46.550
caliber machine gun around to it. They did. They 
riddled it. No explosion. No fire. Fantastic. It

28:52.338 --> 28:56.984
was a dramatic, an absolute dramatic 
development. So Harry Dunning called me at the

28:57.004 --> 29:03.452
office and said, God damn, he said, John, you 
really hit a jackpot. And I said, what happened? He

29:05.735 --> 29:10.782
said, well, you know, you told me you suggested a 
month or so ago when we were out at so-and-so's that

29:11.116 --> 29:15.081
have them test this foam with aircraft tip tanks as 
we did yesterday. And nothing happened, no

29:15.802 --> 29:17.564
explosion. He said the Firestone people are 
ecstatic. They've already called the Air Force at

29:21.308 --> 29:27.896
Wright-Patterson and they're going to go out 
there and give them a test in a day or two. And he

29:28.877 --> 29:32.842
said, if you want to go, I can get you an invitation. 
And I said, Harry, I don't know whether I ought to go

29:32.862 --> 29:37.228
in my position as a military. And he said, well, 
leave that up to you, but he said, so-and-so, I

29:39.601 --> 30:06.317
said, well, I know General so-and-so at 
Wright-Patterson, and he said, let me call him and

29:39.601 --> 30:06.317
get him to invite you to come out there, because 
you're interested in that, you know about it, and

29:39.601 --> 30:06.317
you're interested in the phone, so he did, and this 
Air Force guy called me, and I flew out there that

29:39.601 --> 30:06.317
weekend, and I saw this test out there. Well, to 
make a long story short, the Air Force went into it

30:07.428 --> 30:11.273
in a big way. They retrofitted all the F-105 fleet 
and packed foam in the tanks. And we packed foam in

30:18.501 --> 30:25.149
the gunship tanks, the C-47s that were made into 
gunships. We packed foam in some helicopter

30:26.751 --> 30:29.134
tanks. To my knowledge, and they didn't do it in all 
the aircraft, but the F-105 fleet, they did. They

30:35.662 --> 30:37.384
made a contract and did it in them. ship the foam out 
there and so forth. And Eaton did some here in the

30:40.526 --> 30:47.615
States, but they cut the foam in blocks, kind of 
like a crossword puzzle. And they worked out the

30:47.635 --> 30:55.907
technique to open this inspection plate on the 
tank and just pack the foam in there and push it in

30:47.635 --> 30:55.907
and push it in. To my knowledge, no aircraft that 
had its tank packed with foam and was penetrated by

30:57.429 --> 31:05.700
air-to-air gunfire exploded in flight. So I'm 
sure it was some pilots' lives saved, some

31:09.948 --> 31:15.697
aircrafts saved, because lots of them were hit. 
And it would just leak out of there, see, but there

31:16.458 --> 31:20.824
wouldn't be any fire and explosion. The peculiar 
thing about the phone, see, always in an

31:21.525 --> 31:31.340
explosion, we've always thought from a physics 
standpoint, we had to have two things present. We

31:31.360 --> 31:33.964
had to have an explosive mixture. We had to have the 
right mix of of the explosive mixture, iron,

31:36.477 --> 31:44.684
oxygen, plus gas or gasoline vapors, plus a source 
of ignition. But one thing that we never thought

31:46.166 --> 31:51.831
was crucial to that was space. Space so far as being 
able to propagate the explosion. So in this

31:57.716 --> 32:04.662
polyurethane foam with ten pores to the lineal 
inch, you've got a little round pore space there

32:05.249 --> 32:23.663
that's open, no window on it, that is just a tenth of 
an inch or smaller in diameter, and that's not

32:05.249 --> 32:23.663
quite big enough to sustain an explosion and pass 
it along to the next one. So I think there's really a

32:23.980 --> 32:35.593
new law of physics involved that not only do you 
have to have a physical explosive mixture and a

32:23.980 --> 32:35.593
source of ignition, you've got to have enough 
space. And

32:35.673 --> 32:46.766
after I went to work for Scott, we talked to Boeing 
and tried to get to Douglas. We talked to the Office

32:47.687 --> 32:50.691
of Transportation. We talked to Detroit. Ford 
Motor Company did pack some Thunderbirds with

32:53.512 --> 33:03.223
foam and some Lincoln Continentals with foam and 
drove them around the country and tested them. One

33:03.984 --> 33:07.207
of them had a rear end accident and the tank 
ruptured. There was no firing explosion. I had a 66

33:09.289 --> 33:18.500
T-bird, 67 T-bird, which I packed with foam, 
ordered a new tank packed with foam. Detroit said

33:18.520 --> 33:23.485
even though the cost of the foam to pack a tank would 
only be about $7 to pack the tank, the actual cost.

33:30.354 --> 33:35.599
It would add about $125 to the cost of the 
automobile. And they'd probably make it an option

33:35.619 --> 33:39.383
rather than put it off. And they had all kinds of 
things. And we finally wanted to get the

33:42.066 --> 33:49.573
Department of Transportation to specify that all 
school buses Their tanks would be packed full. And

33:51.747 --> 33:53.391
I think they're still working on that. Scott's 
still working on that. NASCAR, that controls all

33:56.298 --> 34:03.394
the race cars, has specified that all petroleum 
distillate fuel race cars. Their tanks would be

34:07.063 --> 34:09.205
packed with safety foam. Other people since then 
had developed some things to make tanks and

34:09.866 --> 34:14.530
explosive proof. Did you get a patent on this? Did 
you ever get any revenue? No, no. Scott, Scott has a

34:17.373 --> 34:19.495
patent on the foam. No, I just consulted with him on 
it. So, Harry Dunning offered me this job and it was

34:22.998 --> 34:29.544
a, you know, it was a real good job. I held a lot of 
money and I moved in at the up on the corporate level

34:33.192 --> 34:41.641
with my name on the door and stainless steel plaque 
and it was quite a prestigious thing. And where

34:41.721 --> 34:43.242
were you stationed? I was in Philadelphia, right 
there in Philadelphia. See their corporate

34:46.105 --> 34:49.949
headquarters are out at the airport in 
Philadelphia. It was actually about five miles

34:49.969 --> 34:55.175
from my defense personnel support center. So I 
retired that morning and retirement ceremonies

34:55.195 --> 34:59.419
were 11 o'clock. And we had already moved off of the 
place and moved downtown at Society Hill Towers.

35:05.993 --> 35:09.638
We lived on the Delaware River in this high rise 
downtown. So after retirement ceremony, I got my

35:10.720 --> 35:13.645
car. No, I went home, changed clothes, and then 
drove out to Scott. Got there about 1.30 and walked

35:19.293 --> 35:21.937
in my office. They already had my name on the door 
and everything. And I went to work the same day. No

35:27.366 --> 35:28.327
kidding. Yeah. the same damn day. Then I would 
have... Were you pretty bitter about the

35:31.933 --> 35:33.955
military? No, not at all. Not one bit. And I haven't 
been since then. And I stayed there for three years

35:40.903 --> 35:54.178
almost to the day till this situation here kind of 
opened up and Mrs. Adams was still living then. She

35:54.968 --> 36:02.297
wanted me to come down and it was strictly a matter 
of economics as far as I was concerned. We finally

36:02.317 --> 36:08.906
reached an accommodation and I acquired the sales 
company, the C.F. Adams Company, and she gave me a

36:08.926 --> 36:19.339
few shares of the stock of the corporation, the 
manufacturing business.

36:21.614 --> 36:32.070
I acquired some more of it from her at a bargain 
price about a year or two after I was here and then

36:21.614 --> 36:32.070
she passed away five years ago. And are you the 
owner of this company? And she left me some of the

36:34.414 --> 36:41.785
stock and I left the rest of her estate to her two 
living sisters. So I wound up as the majority owner

36:42.647 --> 36:49.377
of the stock and have since acquired some more of 
it. And it's not a big business, but it certainly

36:50.217 --> 36:56.524
has been here 66 years. And so I've, from a personal 
financial standpoint, it's been very rewarding

36:57.645 --> 37:05.334
for me. Now you've made it both in the military 
world. You've climbed the ladder of success both

37:10.200 --> 37:14.805
in the military and in the civilian world. Is there 
differences? I mean, if you become a general, in

37:19.867 --> 37:25.336
the military or if you become a corporate leader, 
is there a difference of how you do it? No. No

37:28.200 --> 37:28.821
difference. I think the military is really a 
little bit ahead of business in down-to-earth

37:30.364 --> 37:44.727
techniques of command and operational control 
and command. I think corporate business could

37:45.348 --> 37:53.944
really learn a few things by copying some of the 
techniques from the military. I think in the

37:55.547 --> 38:00.235
corporate side of it, it's easier to do. because of 
the lack of restraints on you. The only restraints

38:03.542 --> 38:16.680
that you have from a corporate standpoint may be 
your board of governors if you're a minority in the

38:03.542 --> 38:16.680
thing, or your financial capability and so forth. 
But my philosophy in taking a small business and

38:17.841 --> 38:26.593
gradually growing it, I could have expanded I 
would have owed a hell of a lot of money if I had.

38:31.091 --> 38:42.023
That's why I closed the tool department, because I 
found out it would cost me about $1,200,000 to buy

38:31.091 --> 38:42.023
some new forging hammers and furnaces and 
everything. And our competitive position was

38:42.123 --> 38:47.869
such, I knew that we couldn't possibly pay for it. 
And we were making a little money. We were at least

38:50.152 --> 38:54.677
absorbing overhead from the rest of the plant. And 
we had a good product, and people liked it. But I've

38:58.248 --> 39:03.394
concentrated on making the small business 
strong. And in gradually growing, we got bigger

39:04.856 --> 39:09.041
and bigger in gaskets. We diversified strongly in 
gaskets. We've become really a force to be

39:12.004 --> 39:18.572
reckoned with in the gasket market in Houston. And 
we've added a lot of these other things that we buy

39:19.813 --> 39:27.883
for our own account and sell them. We've gone into 
importing. So I've done it slowly and gotten in the

39:31.250 --> 39:39.521
financial position to where we don't have to worry 
about cash flow. We don't owe a dime. I don't owe a

39:41.724 --> 39:43.426
bank a dime. We don't owe a dime for the property. We 
bought the property from the estate of Ms. Adams.

39:49.674 --> 39:51.437
We paid that off last year. We discount every damn 
bill that we owe. As of this minute, I don't guess I

39:54.861 --> 39:58.005
owe a... maybe two or three thousand dollars for 
stuff we haven't even received yet. The minute an

40:03.250 --> 40:06.054
invoice comes in, we pay it. We've got cash in the 
bank. We've got really more cash on hand than we

40:07.636 --> 40:10.679
should. We've got CDs earning money for that. So I 
tried to get us in a very liquid position. And

40:18.788 --> 40:24.415
that's the secret of a small business, to be liquid 
where you don't have to borrow money. And it's just

40:25.103 --> 40:34.516
like in the military to be prepared and keep 
everything maintained so you're ready to respond

40:25.103 --> 40:34.516
in an emergency. And I think the techniques of 
running a business or running a military command

40:35.237 --> 40:42.508
are identical. It's just a different horse of a 
different color. Did you, you know, and usually

40:45.809 --> 41:03.662
when people take a look at their career, they say, 
well, I was at the right spot at the right time, or at

40:45.809 --> 41:03.662
the wrong spot at the wrong time, and they say, in 
some cases, well, my career was determined more by

40:45.809 --> 41:03.662
luck than by the actions that I took myself. Do you 
think that luck or fate is more important than your

41:04.463 --> 41:09.673
own your own work, your own hard work? No, I think 
fate has some point, some factor in it. But I think

41:16.820 --> 41:26.208
really and truly that the end result is largely due 
to the effort you make. To the effort you make, the

41:27.489 --> 41:34.816
extra effort you make, the enthusiasm you put into 
the endeavor. And I think you can fairly well

41:35.977 --> 41:39.340
control that. by your own. But luck does play a 
part. And it probably is not a constant either. It

41:46.113 --> 41:51.260
probably in some situations plays a bigger part 
than in others. It does play a part. You became a

41:53.082 --> 41:54.143
general. Did you consider yourself at the time 
while you were rising in your career, did you

41:54.204 --> 42:00.171
consider yourself ambitious?

42:06.600 --> 42:08.382
I guess you'd have to say that. But I don't think I 
was ever ambitious to where I was overly ambitious

42:09.290 --> 42:24.967
that I would step on somebody's toes or do somebody 
in to gain a brownie point or to gain an advantage. I

42:26.288 --> 42:36.259
think that, well, the biggest mistake that senior 
military guys have both in the service and when

42:37.977 --> 42:43.805
they leave the service, is they think they're 
little tin gods. They think they're just shit on a

42:45.207 --> 42:47.070
stick. And they think they're somebody. And it's 
sad, but that's the problem with most of them when

42:50.315 --> 42:54.420
they retire. And that's why most of them can't get a 
job. Because no job is good enough for them. They

43:03.093 --> 43:04.855
don't want to get their hands dirty. They don't 
want to be down and be humble. I bet when I first came

43:08.588 --> 43:14.497
down here, and I still do, I love to do it. I love to go 
out and call on customers. I bet I'm the only

43:17.622 --> 43:22.650
general that sold plastic fittings or that sold 
leather cups. And hell, it doesn't bother me to

43:24.112 --> 43:35.389
walk in somebody's stranger's office and 
introduce myself and try to convince him to buy a

43:24.112 --> 43:35.389
product that we make or we sell. But the average 
flag officer would think that was below his

43:35.588 --> 43:44.127
dignity or below his decorum to do that. And they 
had an exalted opinion of themselves. And that

43:48.737 --> 43:50.982
problem was evident. both in the service and it's 
certainly evident out of the service. How do you

43:55.254 --> 43:57.797
get rid of that feeling? That feeling, I was an 
enlisted man in the service, and I could tell that

43:58.418 --> 44:04.744
just around the captain of my ship. When I was in the 
Navy, it was very hard to communicate. For most of

44:09.590 --> 44:16.557
us in the enlisted corps, it was very hard to 
communicate with our captain and our XO. We could

44:17.058 --> 44:21.002
communicate with the junior officers, but they 
even had trouble communicating What are you going

44:20.982 --> 44:24.345
to do in the military? I don't know. That's a good 
question. If we knew the answer to that, we could

44:28.610 --> 44:33.675
solve a lot of personnel problems. We could solve a 
lot of communication problems. Because a lot of

44:36.938 --> 44:42.784
things go unattended to on the ship because of that 
lack of communication. And a lot of things go

44:43.865 --> 44:46.888
unattended to in a command. because of that. And 
goodness knows there's a lot of retired people

44:48.335 --> 45:04.739
that could make a contribution in civilian life if 
they just had the humility to get off their goddamn

44:48.335 --> 45:04.739
high horse and get right down and work with their 
fellow Americans and do it. I have a couple of

45:05.881 --> 45:13.753
questions about the military, just the military 
itself and the changes over the last 30 years.
