WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:06.438
Now we're in the spring of 1968 in Pakistan.

00:07.700 --> 00:17.672
Which was a year after Ayub had made this decision with these three things, fertilizer, credit, and the pricing.

00:18.052 --> 00:18.333
Right.

00:20.135 --> 00:30.607
Just with the seed from those 3,300 hectares, he had enough so that it was creating a tremendous impact.

00:30.627 --> 00:31.168
And...

00:31.908 --> 00:37.478
I said that they were either self-sufficient or close to us.

00:39.241 --> 00:47.696
Ford Foundation, I think, prematurely transferred Narvaez to Lebanon, Arsvik to Lebanon.

00:47.716 --> 00:53.106
Hansen had gone a year earlier to Africa.

00:57.372 --> 01:00.215
Havener was brought from East Pakistan over to West.

01:00.776 --> 01:04.480
The current was the director of the Senate.

01:04.500 --> 01:13.731
And so, I was writing this report that they were either self-sufficient or close to it.

01:15.534 --> 01:26.046
And, of course, immediately this damn political... I was there for a week or so, writing on this report, and the campaigning started.

01:26.279 --> 01:28.501
Oh, there were riots and whatnot.

01:30.523 --> 01:38.272
Especially down in Karachi, there'd been an outbreak of smallpox and Ayukon was a very strong advocate of family planning.

01:39.413 --> 01:46.901
And so they'd started to vaccinate children, the smallpox outbreak.

01:46.921 --> 01:53.147
And one of these demagogues, Butoh, who later became president,

01:53.330 --> 02:02.506
Not then, but another election, and was finally... Taken care of IZ.

02:03.007 --> 02:17.413
Yeah, but anyway, he started the rumor around that this was just camouflage, that what was actually happening, Ayub was sterilizing all of these little girls.

02:18.372 --> 02:24.361
All of that kind of stuff, and Bashani who was trained with Mao over in East Pakistan, just stirring up this.

02:24.921 --> 02:31.150
By that time, but the whole countryside quiet, except in the cities, all of this nonsense.

02:31.170 --> 02:36.218
The last day when I was just finishing my report, the harvest was just starting.

02:38.561 --> 02:46.793
This bunch of sophisticated Harvard Ford Foundation economists came in, they said, will you back us?

02:47.600 --> 02:54.850
on cutting the price of wheat from 22 rupees a mound to 18.

02:54.870 --> 02:57.714
I said, hell no, I won't.

02:57.734 --> 03:00.778
They said, we won't have enough money to buy this thing.

03:00.798 --> 03:03.242
Then I said, well, turn up the printing presses.

03:03.262 --> 03:11.773
If you want to destroy the faith in the government, now all you've got to do is to cut from 22 to 18 after you've promised them this.

03:12.214 --> 03:16.560
And with all of that nonsense that's going on in this political campaign since the UB,

03:16.793 --> 03:21.459
has resigned and you'll blow the lid off.

03:22.881 --> 03:23.582
And I refused.

03:23.642 --> 03:26.085
I wrote the report and turned it in.

03:26.105 --> 03:28.188
Went back to Mexico.

03:28.208 --> 03:39.403
And the first of August I got a hurry up call from Yaya Khan, who was the general that took over in a coup when the things started blowing up.

03:39.423 --> 03:42.166
Well, he took over before the elections.

03:42.186 --> 03:43.528
And then the elections were cut off.

03:43.568 --> 03:46.632
The rioting got out of hand and all of this.

03:47.776 --> 03:51.543
and got a telegram to come immediately.

03:51.904 --> 03:54.268
I went over and walked into his office.

03:54.309 --> 03:57.034
He was a brutal bastard.

03:57.054 --> 03:58.076
When was this, about 67?

03:58.477 --> 03:59.939
This was 68.

04:01.663 --> 04:02.484
August of 68.

04:03.606 --> 04:06.432
Walked into his office and he really dressed me down.

04:06.492 --> 04:07.033
He said,

04:07.807 --> 04:09.509
You just wrecked me.

04:09.730 --> 04:12.653
He said, you said we were self-sufficient or essentially so.

04:13.154 --> 04:21.926
He says, the way things are, I'm going to have to go out and import two million tons of wheat.

04:21.946 --> 04:22.967
And I says, I don't believe it.

04:23.608 --> 04:25.270
Let me see what's happened.

04:26.392 --> 04:27.293
I said, give me a week.

04:28.274 --> 04:32.440
So I went, I wired Narvaez to come from Lebanon.

04:33.261 --> 04:35.063
I wired Anderson to come from India.

04:35.549 --> 04:44.377
Meanwhile, I started checking around what was happening, and the drawdown on government stocks, warehouse stocks, was twice the monthly consumption.

04:45.938 --> 04:46.619
Speculation.

04:47.019 --> 04:48.520
They had the government over the para.

04:49.301 --> 04:58.529
And when Nacho and Len arrived, we started going to the big farmers.

04:58.649 --> 05:00.471
In India, there are a lot of big landowners.

05:00.631 --> 05:01.812
It's not like... Pakistan.

05:01.832 --> 05:03.173
Or in Pakistan, excuse me.

05:03.193 --> 05:04.054
It's not like India.

05:04.861 --> 05:08.769
We started to grow some of these big guys that we'd known for the last three or four years.

05:09.591 --> 05:16.845
Asked them how much grain they harvested, what price they got for it.

05:16.865 --> 05:19.330
They said, we haven't sold it yet.

05:19.350 --> 05:20.032
I said, what do you mean?

05:20.613 --> 05:23.920
I said, hell, they cut the price from 22 rupees to 18 rupees.

05:24.781 --> 05:25.603
We still got it.

05:26.782 --> 05:37.293
So this was going on by all the big guys sitting there holding it, and this provoked fear in the government, and they were drawing down the stocks, and hell, it was just a complete chaos.

05:38.054 --> 05:39.795
So the three of us... They brought it upon themselves.

05:40.716 --> 05:51.928
So the three of us rewrote the report, took it in, handed it to Yaya, General Yaya Khan, and told him that that report was probably

05:52.583 --> 05:59.289
they were probably still self-sufficient or so damn close that it made no difference.

05:59.309 --> 06:22.489
But that when they cut the price from 22 to 18, we'd never moved into the market and then people in the grain marketing, knowing that the government was under pressure, was starting to buy at the government control price and where they were going to hold it and feed it into the market later to make a killing on this, this is what's happened.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.810
He's a rough-talking guy in the first place.

06:26.030 --> 06:28.955
He wasn't like you, but a very cultured person.

06:30.377 --> 06:34.402
This guy was a, he was an alcoholic also.

06:34.422 --> 06:39.790
He threw down the report and he cursed and damned.

06:40.231 --> 06:42.174
That's bad when you got one of those.

06:42.694 --> 06:48.122
And cursed and jumped up and down and he said, those damn Harvard economists.

06:48.811 --> 06:58.868
He says, they came in here shortly after you left, wrote this report, and told me I had no choice except to drop it from 22 to 18.

06:58.988 --> 07:02.954
I told him that I refused to go along with them.

07:05.999 --> 07:10.026
And we left with him fuming, and he called them in and fired them all out of the country.

07:13.972 --> 07:15.935
And then what happened?

07:15.975 --> 07:17.358
What was the result?

07:17.538 --> 07:19.141
What happened after the chaos?

07:19.942 --> 07:21.625
Did they ever raise the price or what happened?

07:22.447 --> 07:25.973
Yeah, they got it out from that harvest.

07:26.013 --> 07:29.138
But then all the political chaos... So they didn't raise the price back up?

07:30.240 --> 07:31.041
The government did?

07:31.903 --> 07:33.305
But not completely.

07:33.325 --> 07:34.427
It was kind of a compromise.

07:34.527 --> 07:35.709
Up to 20 or something.

07:35.749 --> 07:37.853
So then the large landowners started to...

07:38.272 --> 07:41.755
But they destroyed the faith and government at the same time.

07:42.035 --> 07:44.598
Right, and they had already ordered two million tons.

07:44.618 --> 07:47.500
Well, they never took delivery on that.

07:47.520 --> 07:48.621
Oh, okay, okay.

07:48.641 --> 07:50.683
Were they almost self-sufficient in the long run then?

07:51.884 --> 07:59.531
But then political chaos set in, the separation of East and West, Pakistan, and with the new government, we didn't get the fertilizer and a whole series of things.

07:59.551 --> 08:06.557
So they never reached full self-sufficiency until...

08:07.347 --> 08:13.233
well, whatever it was, 70, mid 70s or something.

08:13.253 --> 08:20.881
But they could have been there and stayed there from 68 on if it hadn't been for political chaos in this case.

08:20.901 --> 08:24.785
And of course India got a little later start and there was still the fight there.

08:25.206 --> 08:32.393
I was mentioning when we came in, when they ordered in 67,

08:33.183 --> 08:37.710
the 18,000 tons and planted it, and it was beautiful.

08:38.571 --> 08:44.780
And after Swami Nathana and Anderson and I had spent most, and S.P.

08:44.820 --> 08:55.596
Kohli, their coordinator, spent most of the month looking at this, we got a telegram from the Minister of Food.

08:55.964 --> 09:01.492
and agriculture, S. Subramanian, who will be here at that water conference.

09:01.852 --> 09:07.380
He was the guy that made the tough decision on importing those 18,000 tons of seed.

09:09.703 --> 09:18.075
To stop at the tractor, let's see, what's the name of it?

09:18.676 --> 09:22.461
Tractor factory is about 60 miles out from

09:23.082 --> 09:51.452
Escort tractor factory from Delhi on our way back the last day because there was a Dinner given in the honor of the Polish ambassador at that tractor factory They were producing about a 30 38 horsepower beautiful little tractor escort It was all made in India except the transmission which came from Poland so the Polish ambassador was the guest of the founder and

09:52.225 --> 09:53.527
The press, of course.

09:54.147 --> 09:55.729
The Delhi press was all there.

09:55.969 --> 09:56.970
It was a big to-do.

09:57.872 --> 09:59.333
And Anderson saw nothing.

10:00.154 --> 10:04.559
Coley and I came in just before they were sitting down to lunch.

10:04.719 --> 10:07.743
We came into the tractor factory.

10:07.763 --> 10:13.189
The patios out there were filled with these newly painted 35 horsepower tractors.

10:14.551 --> 10:16.533
They weren't selling them.

10:16.553 --> 10:20.798
So the ambassador talked and President Nanda talked.

10:21.723 --> 10:31.613
Then the president, just before he signed off, this was after lunch, he said, maybe Dr. Borlaug would like to say a few words, and I figured, hell, I'll never have a better podium than this one.

10:31.633 --> 10:33.835
And so I said, yes, I would.

10:35.577 --> 10:41.863
I said, you know, we've traveled the last month, and there's no doubt now about what this thing is going to fly.

10:42.884 --> 10:49.030
If we have three things, one, fertilizer of the right kind and in sufficient quantities.

10:49.685 --> 10:54.412
Imported in the short run with provisions made for manufacture here.

10:54.973 --> 10:56.555
Credit for that little guy to buy it.

10:58.799 --> 11:00.662
Pay for it at Harvard.

11:00.682 --> 11:11.939
And a price announced before planting, like had been done in Pakistan before, two years before, to reflect the price of the international market.

11:11.999 --> 11:17.447
Not 60% like they've been paid all down through time.

11:18.997 --> 11:31.453
And if this happens, Mr. Nanda, all those tractors out here are going to disappear before the next planting season and you won't be able to catch up on back orders for years to come.

11:32.174 --> 11:35.178
And there was a great hee-haw, hee-haw laughing.

11:35.839 --> 11:41.446
And I said, I just wish now that I were a member of your Lakh Saba.

11:41.486 --> 11:43.869
That's their house, the lower house.

11:44.510 --> 11:46.653
It would be like chamber deputies.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.295
And I said, I would stand up

11:49.220 --> 11:58.931
Every 15 minutes, irrespective of what was being discussed and out of order screaming in a loud voice, what we need now is more fertilizer.

12:00.133 --> 12:08.622
Well, this was pretty good press or the newspaper people, so they smeared it all over the headlines the next day.

12:10.805 --> 12:16.071
I went to see the minister the next day, which was the 30th of March.

12:16.945 --> 12:17.386
68.

12:17.406 --> 12:18.687
68.

12:21.591 --> 12:23.654
And we told him what we had seen.

12:23.674 --> 12:24.835
It was fantastic.

12:24.855 --> 12:38.613
And I said, now if you get the fertilizer credit, and if you establish that price, like your friends to the West have done two years ago, why nobody can stop this.

12:39.174 --> 12:40.135
And I said, moreover.

12:40.535 --> 12:44.100
And then I suddenly found out I should have known.

12:45.160 --> 12:48.223
Mr. Subramaniam said, I can't help you.

12:49.104 --> 12:52.687
I lost my seat in the election last month.

12:53.247 --> 12:56.330
That was the first time the Congress party lost 40% of its seats.

12:57.231 --> 12:58.812
He said, I was one of the casualties.

12:58.933 --> 13:01.635
I was too involved in this weed program.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.237
I'm out tomorrow night at midnight and I can't help you.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.781
But he said, I believe you.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.145
He said, I want you to, when are you leaving?

13:12.265 --> 13:14.847
I said, tomorrow night at midnight in Pan America.

13:15.299 --> 13:15.900
of Mexico.

13:15.920 --> 13:24.073
He said, I want you to talk to the Deputy Prime Minister, Ashoka Mehta, whom I'd never met and he was pretty much on the left of center.

13:26.476 --> 13:31.945
And I want him to tell you what you have told me.

13:32.185 --> 13:40.719
And I told Subramaniam, I said, you know, I knew that the Congress party had taken a beating in the discussions, but I didn't know that he'd lost SE.

13:42.201 --> 13:42.842
I said, you know,

13:43.362 --> 13:58.035
The shellacking that the Congress party took last month is nothing compared to what's going to happen soon if we don't have fertilizer now and a fair price, because a million people know what can be done.

13:58.536 --> 13:59.737
They've seen it.

14:01.378 --> 14:03.000
And they'll throw out the whole party.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.982
He said, you're talking too late.

14:06.463 --> 14:09.786
They threw me out last month, and I'm out tomorrow night at midnight.

14:09.806 --> 14:12.508
And so he said, I want you to talk to Shokometa.

14:13.282 --> 14:20.052
So he set up the appointment at six o'clock in the afternoon, Swami Natan and I. Anderson wasn't invited just as well.

14:21.133 --> 14:27.443
And before we went in, and as I was leaving Sura Maniam's office, I had my hand on the door and Swami Natan was shaking hands.

14:27.923 --> 14:33.131
He said, Dr. Borlaug, you'll be just as blunt with a Shokometta as you are with me.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.256
He needs to hear the truth.

14:36.276 --> 14:42.765
I never met the guy, but I knew that he was a sort of a pinko on the left.

14:45.023 --> 15:11.858
Even though Mrs. Gandhi was fully in favor of this and had put out this commemoratory stamp six weeks before the wheat revolution, she wouldn't make this kind of a decision because she didn't have the competence, her confidence in her competence in agriculture, except as a general policy role.

15:13.002 --> 15:18.429
So we walked in to Shoka Metta's office.

15:18.470 --> 15:20.372
How do you spell his name?

15:20.392 --> 15:25.499
A-S-H-O-K-A, then M-E-T-H-A.

15:26.781 --> 15:28.123
And his official position was?

15:28.143 --> 15:29.465
He was Deputy Prime Minister.

15:30.406 --> 15:30.646
Oh, okay.

15:32.108 --> 15:41.962
And so, before we walked in, I told Swami Natham, I said, you better not get involved in this discussion.

15:42.022 --> 15:42.823
I'm going to follow.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.657
suggestion of Subramaniam and it may get pretty stormy.

15:46.697 --> 15:49.763
Now it may throw me out, but you and Anderson got to keep it going.

15:50.123 --> 15:53.189
The wheat revolution going if I get thrown out.

15:54.452 --> 16:05.453
And walked in and told him what we'd seen the next month and how many hundreds of thousands or maybe a million farmers had seen what could be done.

16:07.323 --> 16:19.884
But it would all depend now on government policy, availability of fertilizer at a reasonable price, credit for the little farmer to buy it and pay for it at harvest, and a fair price for the grain announced before harvest.

16:19.904 --> 16:25.975
And unless those are forthcoming now, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, you won't sit in that chair a year from now.

16:26.195 --> 16:32.706
They'll throw you out, just like happened to the other 40% of the Congress party in the last election.

16:33.547 --> 16:45.059
He got red in the face and started to talk in a loud voice and I kept talking in a louder voice and we both went on this way, irrational for probably seven or eight minutes until we both ran out of breath.

16:46.220 --> 16:53.828
Then quieted down and talked about it and why we believe this.

16:56.831 --> 17:02.136
He kept saying, but we can't do this, we don't have the funds.

17:03.213 --> 17:04.395
You've got to find the funds.

17:05.036 --> 17:10.143
And moreover, for the long run, you've got to establish more production here in the country.

17:10.764 --> 17:30.975
And I said, you've been negotiating with a number of companies, and you better fund some joint companies with private Indian capital, government Indian capital, and if need be, foreign

17:31.934 --> 17:35.279
private capital, government of India capital, whatever mix.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.342
I said, you have to find the way.

17:37.883 --> 17:40.988
I said, Mexico has done this in joint venture.

17:42.490 --> 17:44.453
Fertilizer capital plant investment.

17:45.074 --> 17:47.037
I said, you can if you'll find the way.

17:47.057 --> 17:50.522
And then he went into a big tirade that you don't understand our government.

17:51.023 --> 17:54.308
We're pretty socialistic and we can't have private capital.

17:54.388 --> 18:01.198
And I said, well, you're going to have to make the decision to remember what's going to happen to your party if you don't have the fertilizer.

18:02.798 --> 18:04.520
We left pretty good friends.

18:04.641 --> 18:08.806
And I kept saying, you know, your friends to the West have done this and so on.

18:09.287 --> 18:11.570
That hurt him some more.

18:11.590 --> 18:21.665
He certainly wouldn't want to emulate the Russian production of grain.

18:21.685 --> 18:21.745
No.

18:21.765 --> 18:24.208
And so we left.

18:24.949 --> 18:32.620
I left Mexico, or for Mexico at midnight, and about ten days or two weeks later I got a lot of clippings from the headlines of the next morning's paper.

18:33.123 --> 18:39.769
of all the main press in India, sent by Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, by Anderson.

18:40.670 --> 18:43.413
I don't remember who sent it from the Ford.

18:43.433 --> 18:50.920
But anyway, the essence was big wheat harvest begins.

18:53.122 --> 19:02.151
The government of India has changed its policy as of last night at midnight when, unbeknown to me, all

19:02.401 --> 19:23.425
negotiations for joint sponsorship of additional fertilizer production capacity, which was to have been canceled last night at midnight, 31st of March, has been left open for further bargaining, at least till the end of the year and perhaps longer.

19:23.445 --> 19:24.046
And that was it.

19:24.687 --> 19:29.472
We started building fertilizer plants and all sorts of things happened.

19:34.548 --> 19:48.961
Once that ball started, of course all along there was this criticism of the rich richer and the poor poorer and these dwarf wheats won't produce enough straw and the oxen and the bullocks will starve to death.

19:50.022 --> 19:54.025
That the early ones were red grains, that the people won't eat them.

19:54.145 --> 19:58.709
I went through all of that agony and listened to all of that nonsense.

19:58.729 --> 20:01.111
That the farmers are ultra conservative.

20:02.392 --> 20:04.234
They're not like the Mexican farmers

20:04.687 --> 20:31.200
bunch of nonsense one right after another and then after this was going then all of the critics from the academia in the Western world especially started talking about the second generation problems that we didn't plan ahead for warehouses that this that and the other hell unless you change production you couldn't plan for warehouse I tried to tell them about that and they'd laugh at me

20:34.117 --> 20:41.784
But I think that what happened was a lot of these fancy planners got their nose so much out of joint.

20:41.804 --> 20:43.326
They were saying it couldn't be done.

20:43.846 --> 20:52.655
And then when it happened, then they had to pick us apart just like some, find everything else that was wrong.

20:52.675 --> 20:53.275
Like children.

20:54.536 --> 21:00.042
Because they were going to plan us into the happy hunting ground.

21:00.062 --> 21:01.723
We got there just scrambling.

21:01.743 --> 21:03.685
Well, in a sense, though, you were planning, too.

21:03.783 --> 21:14.235
Yeah, but they didn't give us credit for that because we didn't have... When I started in India and Pakistan, I had to... This was a bonus contention from the beginning.

21:14.375 --> 21:15.536
They said, where's your report?

21:16.497 --> 21:18.219
And I said, well, give me half an hour.

21:18.319 --> 21:22.263
And I scribbled down about six lines and that was it.

21:22.283 --> 21:24.446
They had these massive big reports.

21:24.466 --> 21:33.756
In Pakistan, for example, the Huntington company did the...

21:35.322 --> 21:40.770
Let's see, which fifth term report would it have been?

21:40.950 --> 21:43.874
55 to 60.

21:44.796 --> 21:48.441
It would have been the plan for the third five-year term.

21:50.143 --> 21:54.910
The whole economic survey done by Huntington's Limited of London.

21:56.032 --> 21:58.655
It had 32 volumes, two around agriculture.

21:59.316 --> 22:01.920
And what they recommended was that...

22:02.457 --> 22:11.753
They should spend a minimum in agriculture because there could be no payoff at least until 1985 at the earliest.

22:12.695 --> 22:15.480
This was 1965 or so.

22:15.800 --> 22:21.310
And of course Ayubad already made the tough decision.

22:21.610 --> 22:24.834
He didn't know that plan was in the making.

22:25.175 --> 22:30.682
When the draft, they said there can be no change until 1985 at the earliest.

22:30.722 --> 22:36.689
So invest as little as you can in agriculture just to keep peace, nothing more.

22:37.130 --> 22:39.353
And they went on and on and on about this.

22:40.654 --> 22:45.661
And before that report, the agricultural part was never published.

22:46.762 --> 22:48.124
That was the draft.

22:49.977 --> 22:55.484
And how long did it take to, well, to increase the production?

22:56.286 --> 22:56.746
In India?

22:59.089 --> 22:59.510
Yeah.

22:59.530 --> 23:00.471
Let me see.

23:00.631 --> 23:03.495
Where are my tables?

23:03.515 --> 23:05.278
Well, it was gradual from then on.

23:06.219 --> 23:10.245
And it went up to 45 million tons this last year.

23:10.405 --> 23:15.732
From 11 million, the average production in India.

23:16.640 --> 23:20.327
From 1961 to 1966.

23:22.612 --> 23:27.060
Average was just under 11 million tons.

23:28.343 --> 23:31.088
Last year, that's about 400 million bushels.

23:31.108 --> 23:38.462
Last year, it was a billion 650 million, about 45.1 million metric tons.

23:40.214 --> 23:51.426
More than a four-fold increase that took place from 67, when the impact started to come, until last year, 84.

23:51.606 --> 24:05.521
Pakistan went from about three and a half, or about, yeah, somewhere around there, from that 61 to 66 to about 13, year before last.

24:05.621 --> 24:07.623
I don't have last year's figures yet.

24:07.643 --> 24:09.765
I'll show you the graph here.

24:09.931 --> 24:15.056
Is India self-sufficient yet?

24:15.076 --> 24:17.959
Yes, it became self-sufficient for the first time in 1979.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.063
It's been self-sufficient in wheat.

24:22.083 --> 24:37.339
The rice started catching on also two or three years later than the wheat and they have been self-sufficient in basic grains

24:37.943 --> 24:39.204
for all of that period.

24:39.224 --> 24:42.248
As a matter of fact, they're exporting in a small amount.

24:43.209 --> 24:46.292
India is exporting some rice now?

24:46.673 --> 24:48.174
Wheat, mostly.

24:48.194 --> 24:48.595
Oh, wheat?

24:49.255 --> 24:49.976
Goodness.

24:49.996 --> 24:51.698
To the Soviet Union, I suppose.

24:52.799 --> 24:53.921
Some of them.

24:53.941 --> 24:56.143
But some to Vietnam and places like that.

24:56.163 --> 24:56.704
Yeah, closer.

24:59.547 --> 25:06.094
The total grain production last year

25:06.327 --> 25:08.470
Well, this was 84 harvest, yeah.

25:08.911 --> 25:11.915
151 million metric tons.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.978
But let me see if I can find it.

25:13.998 --> 25:14.619
For India.

25:15.320 --> 25:15.961
For India.

25:22.049 --> 25:33.145
The production last year was 34 in a fraction million tons more than that base period of 61 to 66.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.929
And that was sufficient

25:36.331 --> 25:46.907
to provide 65% of the calories and protein for an additional 250 million more people.

25:48.089 --> 25:56.222
The value, additional value of that, or the value of that crop last year was $3.3 billion.

25:59.407 --> 26:01.630
What does this mean for starvation in India?

26:02.555 --> 26:06.742
What has this meant for the problems that they had with starvation?

26:07.484 --> 26:12.012
Well, there are two problems whenever you talk about food in these countries.

26:12.192 --> 26:17.722
One is to produce enough, and the second is to distribute it equitably.

26:17.742 --> 26:20.226
And in India,

26:20.611 --> 26:38.572
Despite the fact that there's plenty of grain available in the warehouses, you still see hungry people who are buying just enough to get by on because of unemployment, underemployment, lack of purchasing power.

26:38.592 --> 26:44.058
China has made fantastic progress, but there you see better equity of distribution.

26:45.379 --> 26:46.000
Why is that?

26:46.060 --> 26:48.703
Because of the government?

26:48.723 --> 26:49.504
Because of the system.

26:50.277 --> 26:56.766
And did China eventually accept some of your wheat also?

26:58.008 --> 27:03.917
Yes, but you have to remember that in China most of the wheat is winter wheat.

27:04.037 --> 27:19.339
But they imported about 5,000 tons of Mexican wheat seed for growing in the south and in areas close to the coast where the winter is less severe and up in the Manchurian provinces where the

27:20.821 --> 27:26.108
Plantings are made in this time of the year, early April, as soon as the frost goes through.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.118
I had to see if I can find it.

27:34.579 --> 27:43.311
Here's a table that's where I can take it.

27:43.331 --> 27:44.513
This is Indian rice.

27:44.933 --> 27:48.398
I've got to find it for wheat.

27:55.988 --> 28:00.875
I said 3.3 billion.

28:00.895 --> 28:08.245
It's 6.8 billion dollars of wheat.

28:17.639 --> 28:23.667
So as far as wheat production in Pakistan from 1965 down to 1983,

28:24.372 --> 28:28.580
we can see that it increased about 250% per acre.

28:30.203 --> 28:33.610
That's about what it looks like.

28:33.891 --> 28:41.706
From 760 kilograms per hectare to 1,730.

28:42.513 --> 28:46.758
composite effects, you see, of both yield and more area.

28:48.119 --> 28:51.743
One thing that doesn't show there also is the multiple cropping.

28:51.763 --> 28:57.449
See, these weeks were early enough so that a lot of that land now, with the use of fertilizers, grows a summer crop also.

28:59.632 --> 29:02.014
Rice or bean crop.

29:02.034 --> 29:11.205
So they can get two crops in a lot of areas that they haven't been able to before.

29:11.225 --> 29:11.345
Right.

29:11.365 --> 29:11.625
Now as we can

29:11.842 --> 29:13.423
keeping from getting complacent.

29:15.505 --> 29:22.071
Yeah.

29:22.091 --> 29:28.236
Can we keep these graphs right with the interview?

29:28.256 --> 29:28.356
Sure.

29:28.376 --> 29:29.057
How's your voice?

29:30.117 --> 29:33.360
We better quit.

29:35.482 --> 29:36.583
Testing, testing.

29:36.663 --> 29:41.427
Today is April 26th.

29:42.672 --> 29:43.052
1985.

29:43.213 --> 29:49.259
This is another interview with Norman Borlaug.

29:50.040 --> 29:50.861
This is a test.

29:50.881 --> 29:57.769
This is a test.

29:57.789 --> 29:58.670
I've been here now.

29:58.690 --> 29:59.831
I've been this in my sixth year.

30:00.412 --> 30:01.953
Sixth?

30:01.973 --> 30:03.835
You're a real Texan by this time.

30:06.078 --> 30:08.440
Today is April 26th, 1985.

30:10.443 --> 30:12.645
We are continuing our interviews with

30:12.997 --> 30:13.978
Norman Borlaug.

30:15.581 --> 30:26.335
Last time we talked a lot about India, and there was one question going back over some of the things that we talked about that I wasn't quite sure about, then I want to move to Egypt.

30:26.956 --> 30:37.671
And the one question that I wasn't so sure about was a discovery in grain at Purdue University in 1964.

30:38.005 --> 30:40.708
I think Bickle mentions this in Facing Starvation.

30:40.748 --> 30:51.361
And would you discuss that discovery and what impact that had on your work and how it correlated or disagreed with your work?

30:51.381 --> 30:59.651
Well, you're referring to the high lysine, high tryptophanum, maize varieties, opaque too.

31:01.112 --> 31:03.355
This was a discovery that was made

31:03.419 --> 31:11.050
by a young man by the name of Lynn Bates when he was studying... Bates, B-A-T-E-S, L-Y-N-N.

31:11.070 --> 31:30.356
When he was studying under Dr. Mertz, the biochemist, trying to find out if there was genetic variation in maize for the two most limiting essential amino acids in maize, corn.

31:30.376 --> 31:31.738
And he found the...

31:32.950 --> 31:55.217
He had analyzed many samples, and when he analyzed this one that had been called opaque 2, because that was a genetic character that had been studied several decades before and used for mapping a point on the chromosome.

31:55.237 --> 31:58.401
But it was never realized then that it had any

31:58.820 --> 32:23.241
But when this particular maize was analyzed, it had much higher, nearly double the levels of lysine and tryptophan, which are the two most limiting essential amino acids in the case of maize.

32:23.896 --> 32:30.463
So there was great enthusiasm after this, and there was a lot of research activity.

32:30.584 --> 32:50.646
Well, first let me say, so when this particular kind of maize, it was in a very poor type, but when they had sufficient sample, the chemical analysis bore out what you would expect in

32:51.132 --> 32:52.614
nutritional value.

32:52.834 --> 33:02.366
When it was fed to rats and compared to normal maize without any other source of protein added, they grew at a much faster rate.

33:03.607 --> 33:19.266
Eventually it was tested out also once they'd multiplied so they had sufficient seed on swine, pigs, and again it proved that it had

33:19.786 --> 33:22.328
much higher biological value.

33:22.749 --> 33:39.024
And finally, it was proven on two children, or several children, at the infant's hospital in Columbia, in Del Valle, I guess it was.

33:40.205 --> 33:48.173
Anyway, one of the medical centers in Columbia, South America, where the

33:48.777 --> 34:04.664
Youngster or youngsters, one in particular that was very advanced stages of kwashiachor protein deficiency, malnutrition, was given this.

34:05.285 --> 34:10.093
There were other children who were given ordinary maize, and she began to recover.

34:10.478 --> 34:18.568
Of course, the others had to be taken off the diet that they were on, but it became clear that this had significance.

34:18.748 --> 34:23.714
Then the problem was how to get this into commercial corn varieties.

34:24.595 --> 34:39.473
There was great activity in the U.S., but it was not as simple as it appeared on the surface, because this particular corn, the opaque two,

34:39.773 --> 34:59.252
had very soft kernels, which meant that even after you crossed it with a good variety and you had the same size ear, same number of kernels approximately, the kernel also was very fluffy starch, less dense.

34:59.272 --> 35:08.481
And the result was that it yielded 20, 25, even 30 percent less because of the less density of the kernel.

35:08.984 --> 35:11.927
And then, it being soft, it had other disadvantages.

35:12.768 --> 35:26.364
It was attacked more by insects and also by ear rots, both in the field and in the warehouse in the case of insect damage.

35:26.384 --> 35:29.207
Many university programs in the U.S.

35:29.508 --> 35:37.557
and also the hybrid corn companies started out with fur or tiller.

35:38.060 --> 35:39.722
get this incorporated.

35:40.443 --> 35:47.874
But at that time, everyone thought it was fairly simple and turned out to be very complex.

35:49.016 --> 36:06.902
Our team in Mexico, in the other half of the house, see our CIMIT, the International Mason Wheat Center, has one that's one half of the house works on small grains, which was a section that I was in charge of, wheat, barley,

36:08.198 --> 36:37.513
oats and well let me say it by the time it was the International Center primarily wheat and triticale and the other half is corn mace and so dr. Sprague and his workers started in on this but they had very good chemical and analytical support from the beginning and as a matter of fact dr. or this was before he had his degree Lynn Bates who had been at

36:38.455 --> 36:40.538
when they found this.

36:41.560 --> 37:01.088
He spent, I think, about a year and a half or two years with us when we were getting our laboratory set up, and he and Dr. Evangelina Viegas worked out the techniques for working very closely with the breeders in the development of these corns.

37:01.355 --> 37:19.152
It's been a long, painful process, but now there are some that are indistinguishable from ordinary maize from the standpoint that they will produce as much as the normal, but they still have the benefits of higher nutritional value.

37:19.993 --> 37:24.077
They are now being incorporated into hybrids also in Mexico.

37:25.078 --> 37:29.742
They are just going out into commercial production in a number of countries.

37:30.194 --> 37:54.683
Guatemala for example is pretty well along in this in some of the varieties that are grown in lower elevation Mexico is beginning to multiply some and it's interesting that the southern two southernmost provinces in China already using these that were developed in Mexico and they are incorporating it into

37:55.473 --> 38:25.193
varieties to cover many other parts of China China you see unbeknown to most people is the second largest producer of corn in the world after the US I didn't know that either and as a matter of fact you know China has made fantastic progress in the last 10-12 years in improving its agriculture it of course has

38:26.253 --> 38:34.142
for a long time been the number one producer of rice.

38:35.244 --> 38:36.986
It's the second in corn production.

38:37.526 --> 38:45.436
And this year, it's highly possible that they will displace the Soviet Union as number one wheat producer.

38:45.736 --> 38:48.840
They were only about three million tons short last year.

38:50.982 --> 38:55.888
And it's interesting to see how much progress they've made in their agriculture.

38:56.155 --> 39:01.982
Now to sort of get off the topic and to follow along on this China issue.

39:02.062 --> 39:08.409
So let me just wind up this high nutritive value maize.

39:09.670 --> 39:24.627
It has been shown that this is feasible now and as a matter of fact when we had about two and a half years ago, I guess it was, Dr. William Brown, the ex-

39:25.822 --> 39:52.757
president of pioneer hybrids we asked him to make a critical survey of where we were and whether this was about to be achieved and he made a oral report after he'd been there ten days or so and he said well you've shown this can be done the rest of us gave up and the reason we gave up was that we didn't have the right linkage between the laboratory and the

39:53.345 --> 39:56.689
geneticist who was doing the job in the field.

39:56.709 --> 40:05.941
He says, now we've got a lot of other things that need to be done, but we'll go back at it and get it into our hybrids when the time is right.

40:07.142 --> 40:09.966
It's been demonstrated that it's feasible.

40:09.986 --> 40:14.311
So, now the private seed companies are distributing and selling it.

40:14.331 --> 40:14.912
They will be.

40:16.434 --> 40:16.534
Yeah.

40:17.020 --> 40:20.866
Okay, let's just, now let's, we're going to get, let's go to China a little bit later.

40:20.886 --> 40:21.847
I want to move to India.

40:22.067 --> 40:23.369
I'm not, sorry, not India.

40:23.389 --> 40:24.611
We've already been to India.

40:24.691 --> 40:25.953
I want to move to Egypt.

40:26.434 --> 40:26.834
Okay.

40:26.854 --> 40:37.630
And I want you to discuss the problems and the issues and the results, and then I'd like to talk a little bit about the differences between Pakistan and India versus a different culture, Egypt.

40:38.872 --> 40:41.155
Well, my experience in Egypt...

40:41.540 --> 40:45.126
is more limited than in a number of the other countries.

40:45.366 --> 40:53.920
I've visited there quite a few times, and we have had quite a number of young Egyptians who have come to Mexico to work with us.

40:55.202 --> 41:08.644
But I have never been as directly involved in Egypt as in many of the other near Middle East countries or Latin American countries.

41:10.447 --> 41:36.133
It's interesting from my point of view to look at Egypt, now I'm not talking about the culture now or its agriculture, but if we turn back the time clock to shortly before World War II, the two examples that were held up as sort of a hopeless situation because of land population

41:39.151 --> 41:44.984
per capita arable population and population growth.

41:45.786 --> 41:54.104
The two cases that were frequently referred to as hopeless, or at least very serious, was Egypt and Japan.

41:55.347 --> 41:57.953
Yet, when we look at the two today,

41:58.388 --> 42:01.393
they are in very different situations.

42:01.413 --> 42:13.212
Japan has become a highly industrialized nation with one of the highest standards of living per capita incomes, whereas Egypt is still in the doldrums.

42:13.353 --> 42:15.817
It's still struggling along.

42:15.997 --> 42:17.299
The population has grown.

42:18.301 --> 42:22.067
Even though they brought in a lot of new irrigated land with the Aswan,

42:22.604 --> 42:29.453
The situation has not improved greatly.

42:30.274 --> 42:32.878
As a matter of fact, I think it's more or less the same.

42:33.518 --> 42:34.820
There's miserable poverty.

42:35.781 --> 42:38.605
They're deficient in basic food grains.

42:40.728 --> 42:51.362
And yet, if you compare their yields in the case of wheat, it's much higher than most of the

42:52.220 --> 43:07.703
African Near Middle East countries, but it has been so for quite a long time because of that irrigation and their early use of irrigation water with rather decent cultural practices.

43:08.384 --> 43:18.278
Fertilizer has come in, of course, increasingly in the last couple of decades, but the

43:18.680 --> 43:42.578
Pressure on the land, considering that it's still got a good percentage of its total population in agriculture, is such that they haven't been able to improve their situation nearly so much as the standard of living in Japan.

43:43.469 --> 44:01.008
My contacts there, in the early times, I found, I think I mentioned, when I was finally invited to India in March of 60, February of 63.

44:03.711 --> 44:07.435
Prior to that, for two years, we had this training program.

44:08.360 --> 44:14.271
going for young scientists' hands-on training in Mexico at CIMINT.

44:14.291 --> 44:15.513
That was before CIMINT.

44:15.613 --> 44:16.535
I have to be careful.

44:17.015 --> 44:30.800
That was after the program had been the original cooperative Mexican government Rockefeller Foundation program had completed its work.

44:30.820 --> 44:32.022
Several of us

44:32.322 --> 44:51.364
affiliated with that program were still based in Mexico, asked consultants and working directly with the new Mexican organization that had assumed the responsibilities, the National Institute for Agricultural Investigation, INEA.

44:53.186 --> 44:59.393
And it was during that time

45:01.904 --> 45:04.707
I didn't know what was going to happen to me.

45:05.207 --> 45:06.509
This is early 1960s?

45:06.649 --> 45:07.069
60.

45:07.189 --> 45:09.932
This was in 59 and 60 and 61.

45:10.132 --> 45:31.354
And as a matter of fact, I, during this period, seriously considered going with the United Fruit Company to see what could be done about Fusarium wilt disease on bananas in Central America.

45:32.144 --> 45:43.561
looked at it seriously, and then there were discussions in the Rockefeller Foundation about what's going to happen to the people who finished their job in the Mexican program.

45:44.862 --> 45:59.704
And there was an apparent great need for soybeans varieties that would fit the semi-tropics and tropics.

46:00.511 --> 46:22.831
So, I talked to Dr. Al Mosman, who was then in charge of the Agricultural Sciences in the Rockefeller Foundation, and I said, you know, there's a great need for some really aggressive work on soybeans for the tropics and near tropics.

46:22.891 --> 46:29.117
I see the need, and I'd like to do this with your support.

46:29.418 --> 46:30.980
if the foundations interest them.

46:31.881 --> 46:41.793
And he and Harar, and I suppose Wardman, discussed this, I'm sure, over several weeks.

46:42.354 --> 46:49.362
And finally they decided, no, this couldn't be because I had too much experience in another crop.

46:49.382 --> 46:58.193
And this was, you see, when the situation was growing real critical in Pakistan and India in 1960.

46:58.493 --> 47:05.288
And so, they suggested instead, they contacted FAO.

47:05.869 --> 47:13.104
They were interested in having a reading on the whole wheat programs from Morocco to India.

47:14.107 --> 47:19.017
And so, I was commissioned, I suppose,

47:19.351 --> 47:28.141
It was in 1961, and I spent from... You were commissioned by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.

47:28.161 --> 47:41.257
I was commissioned or assigned from the Rockefeller Foundation to work with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to make this survey of what the problems were from Morocco to India.

47:41.858 --> 47:46.523
Primarily on wheat, but anything I saw on agriculture in general.

47:47.279 --> 47:50.893
And so I visited all of those countries at that time.
