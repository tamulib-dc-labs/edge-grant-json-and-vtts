WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:05.462
Thinking about some of the things that your dad 
enjoyed doing. Yes. Go ahead. And truly, if he had

00:07.244 --> 00:14.794
time, he was wanting to be with friends. And 
certainly at the top of that list would be Maggie

00:14.814 --> 00:19.319
McGee. From Fort Worth. No, Houston. Houston. 
Maggie was president of Tenneco Pipeline. Oh,

00:26.508 --> 00:26.949
that's right. That's right. at some point was 
president of former students. Now, what year was

00:32.848 --> 00:33.990
that? That was in the 60s. But he and dad remained 
friends forever. And some of the nicest trips that

00:40.538 --> 00:47.408
mother and dad got to take were with the McGees. And 
they traveled together and always were doing good

00:47.428 --> 00:54.197
things for A&M, I think, wherever they went. And 
Congressman Teague. Yes. And Dad didn't get to see

00:58.341 --> 01:02.606
him as much just because of the distance between 
D.C. and here. But their friendship went way, way,

01:03.067 --> 01:06.551
way back to student days, didn't it? It did. I 
don't, you know, people like Lupo could really

01:07.072 --> 01:11.217
tell. And, you know, of course, Lupo was Mr. 
Teague's roommate. But Mr. Lupo would tell you

01:15.884 --> 01:22.913
that, you know, he said, I really wasn't your dad's 
good friend, even though they were classmates.

01:22.953 --> 01:23.093
Mm-hmm. But they were not as well acquainted as 
Dad. Because I've heard an anecdote that I haven't

01:26.651 --> 01:43.888
tried to follow up on, but that, let's see, Lupo got 
in trouble for taking a rap from Mr. Teague's

01:26.651 --> 01:43.888
alcohol in the dorm room or something like that. 
Oh, I didn't know. I didn't know that. I didn't know

01:45.810 --> 01:46.491
that. And that may have been a Lupo story. All 
right, if your dad were going to invite a group of

01:48.733 --> 01:53.518
buddies, friends, over to the house for an 
enjoyable evening. And he was making up the guest

01:59.333 --> 02:00.974
list. Who do you think would have been on? Maggie 
McGee and who else? Maggie and Sally. Dad always

02:06.459 --> 02:07.600
stayed in touch. MJ Green had been his best friend 
from Eden, Texas. Best man in each other's

02:13.646 --> 02:15.027
wedding. There was a painter, was one of his 
classmates, John Miller. Now do you mean a house

02:22.861 --> 02:25.024
painter or an artist painter? Well, he painted 
billboards.

02:28.910 --> 02:36.601
But apparently MJ Green and John Miller and my dad 
were just the best chums from Eden, Texas. And I can

02:38.003 --> 02:42.950
remember talking to dad about what made him do some 
of the things. And I think that group, or the

02:43.331 --> 02:46.776
competition of a group of young friends, He said, I 
just couldn't stand for them to be able to do

02:47.127 --> 02:50.211
something I couldn't do better. I think that young 
boy competition, but he always stayed. Anytime

02:56.519 --> 03:01.486
we'd go to the ranch, we'd stop by Buchanan, which 
was where John Miller had settled. Now when he'd go

03:01.867 --> 03:06.773
to the ranch, what did he check on first? We got the 
part of the land that had the old family home. So my

03:11.845 --> 03:17.231
granny and papa's mother's folks home is part of 
ours. And so you'd check on the house, you'd check

03:18.052 --> 03:23.738
on the water, you'd check on the barns, you'd check 
on, then you'd get in the pickup. And the kids

03:24.319 --> 03:27.983
always got to ride in the back of the pickup. And if 
it was hunting season, it was our job to beat on the

03:28.704 --> 03:32.869
top if we spotted a deer. But he would just He just 
loved driving the pastures. And as he was driving

03:40.785 --> 03:46.476
the pastures, he was checking on the water supply, 
the quality of the grass. I can remember him

03:47.938 --> 03:59.179
telling me about after the drought in the 50s, and 
all the cattle had to be shipped, and they had been

03:47.938 --> 03:59.179
Herefords prior to that, and O.D. Butler. helped 
Dad restock the ranch after that and recommended

04:00.112 --> 04:04.798
Black Angus. And I can remember a lesson in judging 
cattle and what fine beef these were. And what did

04:12.086 --> 04:14.129
he have before Black Angus? The Herefords, the 
Whiteface.

04:20.417 --> 04:22.259
He was really happy out there. I can remember him 
chasing rattlesnakes. And he truly, he didn't do,

04:28.360 --> 04:33.705
I guess he'd grown up doing it. I can remember him 
driving in the car and if a train was coming by, he'd

04:35.047 --> 04:40.753
race it. There were just a lot of kind of neat things 
that he did his whole life. All right, let's make

04:48.240 --> 04:53.385
believe you and your mom are gonna plan his 
favorite meal. Oh, his favorite meal.

04:58.364 --> 05:01.248
Probably roast beef or steak. He was not a big one 
for vegetables. And he had

05:05.513 --> 05:12.221
a sweet tooth that I think we all inherited. He 
loved good food and good friends gathered around

05:12.401 --> 05:18.489
and the kids. Would there have been any mashed 
potatoes and gravy? Mashed potatoes and gravy,

05:20.872 --> 05:25.738
chicken fried steak, you bet. Fried chicken. 
Fried chicken, sweet tooth. What kind of pie or

05:28.968 --> 05:30.710
cake? Pecan pie. Mother used to make lots of 
desserts. She'd make a lemon meringue and a

05:35.355 --> 05:39.580
chocolate meringue and chocolate cake. 
Grandmother Roddy was a wonderful cook.

05:47.089 --> 05:49.091
And the ranch was a ranch. It wasn't farming. It was 
ranching. Right. And in both your parents, they

05:52.475 --> 05:55.438
grew up in ranching. country. And if I were to ask 
your dad geographically what part of Texas Eden

05:58.787 --> 06:06.718
was in, what would he say? You know, West Texas. He 
would have said West Texas. West Texas.

06:11.644 --> 06:19.295
Geographically, McCullough County just next is 
the geographic center by a lot of measurements of

06:11.644 --> 06:19.295
the state of Texas. And now it's considered to be 
the hill country. Now Menard County is the western

06:25.118 --> 06:26.940
edge of the hill country. But he would have said 
West Texas, that's why. Because I think it quite

06:29.463 --> 06:32.347
often depends on people. I thought West Texas, 
before we moved to El Paso, began with the

06:32.968 --> 06:39.536
interstate that goes through Austin. I agree, 
yeah. When I got to El Paso, they were saying, no,

06:40.216 --> 06:46.424
no, no, West Texas is everything this side of 
Odessa. Did they? Isn't that funny? See, it

06:48.647 --> 06:50.008
depends on where. And they thought East Texas 
began at Austin. Isn't that interesting? And I

06:55.456 --> 06:56.177
said, no, no. Isn't that interesting? So we 
agreed. Let's see. Dad's pet peeves, as you

07:00.763 --> 07:03.086
remember. What could you do or anybody do that 
would really? Not telling the truth. Not telling

07:09.493 --> 07:10.174
the truth. There was some incident when my brother 
and I, we were still living in Brady, and it had to do

07:11.095 --> 07:19.366
with leaving soap in the sink. And the two of us had 
to stand in there until one confessed. So truth

07:23.422 --> 07:28.590
telling absolutely was essential. Ladies had to 
be ladylike. I mentioned I loved to sew and I was

07:32.475 --> 07:39.446
always encouraged to sew with big family and my 
grandmother had taught me to sew on an old treadle

07:32.475 --> 07:39.446
machine. I can remember being upstairs with my 
fabric, my feet spread out and cutting fabric

07:39.967 --> 07:47.638
between them. And I can remember Dad really not 
approving of the way that the young lady was

07:51.350 --> 08:15.484
sitting even though i was upstairs in the private 
area but being you know boys were supposed to be

07:51.350 --> 08:15.484
certain ways and girls were supposed to be certain 
ways all right now uh you mentioned a while ago that

07:51.350 --> 08:15.484
he said that he thought he smelled tobacco would it 
have been acceptable for you to start smoking as a

07:51.350 --> 08:15.484
youngster No, no. In fact, I had started smoking, 
and I never smoked around him. And when the house

08:21.551 --> 08:28.199
burned in 63, some friends back at school said, oh, 
tell me you weren't smoking in the bathroom. And I

08:28.579 --> 08:30.702
wasn't. But, oh, no. In fact, he offered, the deal 
was, and I don't know if it was with the younger

08:33.064 --> 08:43.817
kids, with my older brother and I, if we reached 21 
and did not smoke, then he would give us $100. And in

08:44.101 --> 08:48.068
1963, that was a whole lot of money. And it just 
happened that the same week that I turned 21, I was

08:48.810 --> 08:53.418
graduating from the University of Texas. And so 
Mother and Dad came to graduation, and Dad hugged

08:54.120 --> 09:00.171
me, and he said, Sister, I've got $100 in my pocket. 
And he pulled it out. He said, Did you earn it? And I

09:03.738 --> 09:05.080
said, No, sir, I didn't.

09:08.840 --> 09:09.781
Did he say anything? Not a word. Did he act 
surprised? Not a word. That was it. Okay. That was

09:16.568 --> 09:16.969
it. Let me share with you a Missouri version of 
that. The legendary football coach up there was

09:20.453 --> 09:27.560
Don Farrow, F-A-U-R-O-T. Died three years ago, 
age 93. Oh, my. Never smoked, never drank. Only

09:31.605 --> 09:33.947
strong language was hell and damn. And I asked him 
what led him up to it. And he said, well, I've got to

09:35.569 --> 09:37.171
go watch. I said, well, I don't know what you mean. 
He said, well, where I grew up, all the boys were

09:38.962 --> 09:47.390
church-going people, were told, if you won't 
smoke till you're 21, I'll give you a gold watch.

09:47.410 --> 09:49.112
And he said to us, that was like a Cadillac. He said, 
I and all my brothers got gold watches. They also

09:53.076 --> 09:55.278
lived into their 80s and 90s. Isn't that 
wonderful? Yeah. To my knowledge, I don't think

09:57.880 --> 10:00.123
Dad ever smoked a cigarette. I never was aware of 
that. I don't think even in the service. I don't

10:03.506 --> 10:05.728
think he ever, ever did. Now, my brother, who just 
stopped smoking a few years ago, I said, well, Bud,

10:05.776 --> 10:12.285
we were comparing notes. We'd never compared 
notes. And he said, I said, well, did you get your

10:13.928 --> 10:15.850
$100? And he said, I sure did. I said, well, you 
lied. And he said, no, I didn't. I just started

10:20.757 --> 10:22.240
smoking the next day. All

10:22.620 --> 10:26.085
right. Now, would it have been acceptable for you 
to drink beer or whiskey as a youngster? Oh, no.

10:31.653 --> 10:31.753
Okay. That was it. That was it. But in a way, I was 
blessed with an easy spirit. I mean, those were

10:38.293 --> 10:41.076
never things... Well, same for me. I grew up in that 
same setting. You know, I just... There were

10:46.162 --> 10:47.083
certain rules. Pleasing Mother and Dad was a lot 
more important to me than any of that other stuff.

10:51.148 --> 11:01.180
All right, and see, I think I see also consistency 
of those attitudes in your family and what A&M...

11:02.206 --> 11:03.468
50s, 60s was. Situation's different in a whole 
bunch of ways now than then. All right, let's go

11:11.238 --> 11:14.422
near the sad part. Were you aware of any failure in 
your day? Let me just mention one thing, too. My

11:19.428 --> 11:24.855
son, when he was in med school in Dallas, would talk 
to high school and junior high kids. And he would

11:25.038 --> 11:26.399
tell the story. And he'd say, we always had to go, 
just my brother and me and mom. But he said, we

11:31.244 --> 11:34.367
always had to go and kiss mother when we got home. 
And she always took a deep breath. So she knew what

11:36.390 --> 11:40.274
we had been doing. Been there. Anyway, so it does 
carry on. Oh, let's see. When you would come in from

11:45.699 --> 11:48.882
a date, somebody was still awake. Oh, yeah. Oh, 
yes. Mm-hmm. Well, it wasn't that late. No, no, but

11:53.366 --> 11:56.691
whether it was or was not. Oh, sure. Oh, sure. Were 
you aware of any health problem your dad was having

11:59.776 --> 12:04.463
before his death? I know that when he would go to the 
hospital, he didn't want visitors. And I know that

12:10.733 --> 12:14.058
there were a few times when he would have spells. 
See, we faculty types were not aware of it. The

12:18.312 --> 12:21.456
Christmas before Dad died, I was in Michigan. My 
son Mark and I had lost a first baby. So the second

12:26.462 --> 12:31.748
baby was the first grandchild and was much loved 
and way too far away. Dad insisted he wanted me home

12:32.709 --> 12:36.494
for Christmas. And I can't remember all the 
circumstances, but I would have been able to come a

12:37.675 --> 12:47.307
month in early February and stay a long time. And so 
I didn't come at Christmas. Now that would have

12:51.236 --> 12:53.682
been Christmas of 69. Of 69. And then I got the call 
that he was in Houston and was very ill. late

13:00.635 --> 13:03.919
January, I think last May 30th of January. So it's 
almost like I wasn't aware that he was sick, but

13:05.260 --> 13:13.069
looking back on things, you know, you just think 
something was going on. He had never, he had never

13:13.249 --> 13:18.214
been insistent like that, that I come home and 
bring the baby. And also, I'm assuming, jumping to

13:18.855 --> 13:25.022
confusion again about Texas and real world, I'm 
assuming that he thought of himself as a strong,

13:25.407 --> 13:29.635
able-bodied man. He loved it. He loved a hitsack. 
Feel that. Feel that. He's got strong legs and

13:34.183 --> 13:37.028
hitsack. Feel that muscle. And even his arms. Like 
heck I can't. I'll show you that I can't.

13:48.965 --> 14:09.546
The only time when I was pregnant after, again, 
having lost the first baby, I came home and I just

13:48.965 --> 14:09.546
was nearly pregnant, and that was when we had 
Ranger, the bulldog, and we were out at Carter

13:48.965 --> 14:09.546
Lake, and my brother and the dog were in Head Davis' 
little John boat, and I wanted to get in, and Dad

13:48.965 --> 14:09.546
said, Sister, don't get in. I'm not sure I can jump 
in and save you. So, you know, a few things like

14:12.089 --> 14:16.373
that, but never... Before, and then sure enough 
the dog jumped in and drowned. Let's digress on

14:21.516 --> 14:22.918
Ranger. How old was Ranger, the dog? We had 
several. The only dogs we'd ever had were

14:28.124 --> 14:30.327
Bulldogs. There's a picture of me with Dad getting 
off the Victory Loan train, and he comes off with

14:31.088 --> 14:38.638
this little Brendol Bulldog pup. And from then on, 
that's all we had was Bulldogs. But the dog that's

14:42.122 --> 14:44.385
buried on, that's Ranger. Right. Well, they were 
all rangers, except for one female with Lady.

14:49.012 --> 14:49.233
Right. Now, that's not the dog that you all brought 
here when you moved here, is it? The one that's

14:53.599 --> 14:54.441
buried? No. No. One died, and then the Corps gave my 
brother another one. I really think it was that

15:02.213 --> 15:05.217
very last one that was such a character. I think so. 
I think so. I think so. And is buried there. Now,

15:09.444 --> 15:11.006
whose idea was that? Do you know? No. No. Because I 
don't think it was your family's idea. I think that

15:14.477 --> 15:16.480
was the Corps' idea or something. Probably. 
Because I think they had gifted Bob that dog.

15:22.027 --> 15:27.193
Because if I'm not mistaken, that dog had just 
about the same privileges as Rebel. Oh, and I think

15:28.996 --> 15:37.086
it had been fed so much that it had health problems 
and it had... Was that the one that even operated on

15:38.213 --> 15:40.155
it? Because, you know, bulldogs are notoriously 
hard to breathe because of their facial

15:40.235 --> 15:47.904
construction. I think so. All right, so you 
weren't aware of any approaching serious health

15:49.446 --> 15:54.893
problems on your dad. All right, and then you got 
the call. His blood pressure was high. He worked

16:00.459 --> 16:01.380
too hard. He didn't eat, you know, all of that. 
Because now what I heard through the grapevine

16:04.043 --> 16:07.107
was, combination of heart and kidney, and that 
each affected the other. Those are things Mother

16:13.733 --> 16:17.397
could tell you. The only time I became, I remember 
being aware of kidney problems were after he was in

16:17.737 --> 16:23.162
the hospital. I wasn't aware of any kidney 
problems prior to that. How long was he in the

16:27.105 --> 16:29.548
hospital? He had apparently a stroke or cerebral 
hemorrhage. I want to say it was January 30th. And

16:36.365 --> 16:38.268
then he died March 23rd. He was here just a day or 
two. And then,

16:41.793 --> 16:52.530
how did I get home?

16:52.570 --> 16:58.459
Maybe even Maggie, I know Maggie McGee came to get 
me in the tentacle plane when Dad died on that day.

16:59.220 --> 17:05.089
And he may have done it even before that, when Dad 
was, I can't remember how I got home with Mark. Now

17:05.288 --> 17:15.198
for me, as a young faculty member, the memorial 
service was the biggest gathering I'd ever seen of

17:05.288 --> 17:15.198
national leaders. And that I remember, and that 
was an illustration of me, to me, of your

17:15.899 --> 17:22.867
father's... I'd never met President Johnson 
before that. I'd never met Mrs. Johnson. I was so

17:27.451 --> 17:30.455
struck by their kindness. I was struck by her 
beauty. Yes, yes, yes, yes. To this day, I can't

17:33.993 --> 17:41.785
walk into the first floor of the old systems 
building, of the Williams building, because

17:33.993 --> 17:41.785
that's where dad was. They had him in the castle. 
Let's see. I'll tell you, Lady Bird Johnson, this

17:47.092 --> 17:56.186
is the first board meeting, regents meeting, 
after we got to UT El Paso. Mrs. Johnson had just

17:56.827 --> 18:00.372
gone off the UT board But she was invited to this 
dinner on Thursday night, and you'd go through,

18:00.959 --> 18:12.971
get your meal, and then we were having it at the 
Chancellor's Residence, and we go into the

18:00.959 --> 18:12.971
library, and here comes Mrs. Johnson. So we go over 
and introduce ourselves, and I told her a story

18:13.792 --> 18:28.367
about when Linda Bird, as a freshman at Austin, 
came over here in the fall, I think it was 62, to

18:13.792 --> 18:28.367
Scoma to hear her father speak. And the Corps 
commander at the event all-male Texas A&M took

18:28.668 --> 18:43.922
Linda Bird to eat lunch in Duncan Binding Hall a 
week after the Longhorns had massacred the Aggies

18:28.668 --> 18:43.922
on Thanksgiving Day. And in the middle of the meal, 
at a given signal, every freshman jumped up and

18:43.942 --> 18:49.527
yelled, beat the hell out of TU. Oh, no. And they all 
then stopped and stared at her. She slowly put her

18:54.071 --> 18:56.773
napkin on the table. The room got very quiet. She 
sat there a moment, then stood up, pushed the chair

18:58.958 --> 19:11.434
underneath the table, stared at the group, and 
then did hook on horn and yelled out, hook on horn.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.237
And everybody stood and cheered for her. And when I 
told Mrs. Johnson that, she smiled. She said,

19:16.901 --> 19:19.163
that's my girl. How's her health? She can barely 
walk. She then said, I begged my daughters not to

19:23.169 --> 19:27.514
marry a politician. not to put their children 
through all the problems that we put them through.

19:33.607 --> 19:36.831
But she said, Chuck has campaigning for governor. 
I'll be up there in Richmond Monday to help him

19:37.412 --> 19:42.038
campaign. And I thought, oh boy. Now,

19:45.101 --> 19:53.452
your dad made these great changes here. Are there 
some things that you thought thought I was going to

19:56.873 --> 20:01.780
chat about that I have forgotten and have 
overlooked. What are some other things that we

20:02.201 --> 20:06.226
should have covered that I haven't? Gosh, you're 
so good at this. How many are you going to

20:08.850 --> 20:10.052
interview? Do you know all the total? Oh, 
countless. Dozens. Oh, I've already done 50 some

20:12.916 --> 20:14.618
odd. Have you really? Yeah. This will go on two or 
three, four years. No, really, I just feel

20:19.886 --> 20:24.332
battling that I don't have... more pertinent 
recollections. But truly, I think the best thing

20:27.161 --> 20:32.547
my folks did for me was to kind of turn me loose once 
we got here. Because I absolutely loved it. Now, I

20:36.070 --> 20:40.835
don't remember your mother's health being ever, I 
always remember her in high gear. She was in high

20:40.855 --> 20:41.536
gear. The only problem she's had is she's had foot 
problems. And she really, the walk, the standing

20:44.539 --> 20:51.407
and receiving lines was, I think, very difficult 
for her. And... But she and I played tennis until

20:52.932 --> 20:57.898
after we got here for years. Now, let's see, in 
terms of the, did your dad enjoy Aggie athletics or

20:59.159 --> 21:04.606
was that a? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. In fact, having been 
the football coach in Brady, and then as mayor, at

21:07.249 --> 21:15.439
the time we left there, he had been mayor of Brady. 
Oh, sure. And I just remember, I mean, he loved

21:16.199 --> 21:20.965
going there. And for me, all my other friends were 
allowed to run and play. And I had to sit, and I had to

21:24.686 --> 21:27.349
press up. But other questions? Other things that I 
haven't looked at, I forgot. Well, if there are,

21:35.960 --> 21:39.885
when you get the typescript, please add them. 
Thanks. Like I said, I just loved my daddy. I think

21:45.252 --> 21:45.973
that's it. But let's close with this. If he were 
here today, what do you think his opinion would be

21:48.870 --> 21:58.399
of Texas A&M as it is now? That is one thing. After 
you told me you wanted to come talk to me, one of the

21:59.240 --> 22:09.590
things I thought is that often, not often, but 
through the years, people have been very free

21:59.240 --> 22:09.590
about saying what daddy would or would not have 
done. And the one thing my dad was not was

22:09.630 --> 22:14.475
predictable. And so, I have really,

22:14.624 --> 22:25.678
to look at A&M, you just have to know that he would be 
pleased as punch. But as far as opinion on

22:26.960 --> 22:42.420
specifics and stuff, he was never that 
predictable that I would even,

22:26.960 --> 22:42.420
I just, like we said early on, of all the people I've 
known in my 57 almost years, he loved doing what

22:42.940 --> 22:51.730
he's doing. He didn't, if he had complaints, he 
didn't verbalize them in my earshot. And I just, I

23:00.541 --> 23:09.191
think if he could see what it has become, he would 
just be overwhelmed. He deserves so much of the

23:09.391 --> 23:12.035
credit. That's a great thing.
