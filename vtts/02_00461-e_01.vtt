WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:03.926
It's too stingy with my time. No, that's good. If I 
had my life like a cat, I would say, fine, what do you

00:05.028 --> 00:10.958
want me to do? Go to Europe for two years, three 
years, spend more time in labor camps, slave

00:10.978 --> 00:17.890
labor. Okay, then I'll come back the next life, got 
another one, I'll do something different. You

00:23.299 --> 00:23.980
know, you only have one and... I

00:24.213 --> 00:43.997
was already

00:24.213 --> 00:43.997
told what to do long enough,

00:24.213 --> 00:43.997
much too long. I had started out

00:44.017 --> 00:49.624
pretty good as a student and then at work it was just 
terrible. It took me four years to survive. And, of

00:51.652 --> 00:57.998
course, in the early parts, remember, there was no 
Europe to speak of. It was just devastating.

01:01.261 --> 01:08.508
Because, you know, the Soviet zone was probably 
out after about 1952 or 1953. By that time, you were

01:08.568 --> 01:11.511
in such bad terms with the Russians. Yeah, but I 
didn't read the paper that much. And politics, I

01:14.434 --> 01:18.638
had it up to here. Right. So you stayed away from the 
paper, and you stayed away from... I read it, but it

01:22.509 --> 01:26.875
didn't really, you know, I... I wasn't... I wasn't 
going to let anybody make a decision over my life

01:28.777 --> 01:39.470
when I had taken my life into my hands already. And 
why should I give it back to some clown and tell me we

01:39.831 --> 01:48.962
have now a directive and I can't help it, I'm only a 
little bureaucrat, it comes from above, You must

01:49.229 --> 01:51.172
do this, that, and the other. Forget it. Do your 
thing. I do mine. I

01:55.578 --> 02:02.267
just never could see it. I know it doesn't sound 
very law-abiding. It's kind of outside the law.

02:07.133 --> 02:15.625
But there has to be a higher law that you can live 
your own life and not have to be sent all over the

02:07.133 --> 02:15.625
world. Were you that bothered in the same way when 
you were drafted and they were saying, now this is

02:15.925 --> 02:21.870
what you're going to have to do? Was it the same 
sense of, don't tell me what to do, or was it weaker

02:21.890 --> 02:25.414
back then? Well, I have to admit in those days, you 
know, we do have a lot of, we're into the military,

02:25.434 --> 02:43.610
the Germans are, and being from part of Prussia, 
you know, they have a lot of military traditions,

02:25.434 --> 02:43.610
so I have to admit, you know, okay, I do my stuff. And 
in those days, they were doing this kind of blitz

02:46.047 --> 03:11.633
thing they were going in and no more battles this is 
it we're just going to do this and that and the other

02:46.047 --> 03:11.633
and people were coming from Hungary I met some real 
nice girls from Budapest came to tennis

02:46.047 --> 03:11.633
tournaments you know I mean it was a whole new world 
was opening up people from Poland would come in so

02:46.047 --> 03:11.633
it was a kind of a different Europe say Well, did the 
attitude that it was okay then last through the

03:11.917 --> 03:26.858
period that you were still officially free, you 
know, even up through the classical, or was there a

03:11.917 --> 03:26.858
point that you became annoyed with having them 
tell you, now you go here, now you go there, now you

03:11.917 --> 03:26.858
retreat? Absolutely. Absolutely. It probably, 
it just built up, you know, from the time, of

03:29.281 --> 03:41.518
course, the war, the actual battle experience 
started it, you know, because that's, that's, you

03:41.920 --> 03:45.984
know, sleeping in a foxhole, digging in a foxhole 
every other night. I mean, that's just enough to

03:46.104 --> 03:48.647
drive you crazy. And then we were taken prisoner. 
We just went from one camp to another in North

03:53.212 --> 03:59.278
Africa, and that went on for months and months and 
months. And in this country, we transferred them

04:00.340 --> 04:08.248
months and months, and, you know, just constantly 
being moved. I'd rather move on my own and not have

04:08.988 --> 04:14.836
anybody tell me where to go. I have to move or stay or 
starve. If I want to starve, I can starve. It was

04:18.601 --> 04:20.223
interesting what you just said. Since you said 
you've got hives, every time she said it, it's time

04:20.243 --> 04:23.887
to move. Yeah. So it wasn't that it was your choice 
then. I think that's probably quite accurate. The

04:30.116 --> 04:31.958
actual moving doesn't bother me. It's probably 
when I'm ready to move. But she was ready to move,

04:35.243 --> 04:36.925
so... So you didn't get the hives when you hopped 
the train back to the Texas border to try and go

04:37.105 --> 04:46.658
across or

04:37.105 --> 04:46.658
anything like that? So some of it probably is 
pretty hard to understand from a law-abiding,

04:46.678 --> 04:53.428
citizen viewpoint, you know? I hear that all the 
time. I get that message. I even got it from my

04:56.452 --> 04:57.854
nieces. Why didn't you, you know? it's except my 
dear wife never pushes me on that particular point

05:00.052 --> 05:29.029
that that is that freedom believe it or not as I have 
more freedom as a fugitive than I probably ever

05:00.052 --> 05:29.029
will have in my life I have no number nobody can 
reach me you know if I as long as I pay now I have of

05:00.052 --> 05:29.029
course a number I pay into it now they're getting 
everything already crisscrossed with computers

05:00.052 --> 05:29.029
yes and I you know but in In those early days, I was 
totally free. I was still, I could have been

05:33.313 --> 05:36.597
drafted to the Korean War. I didn't have to go to the 
Korean War, and so on. It's just an incredible...

05:43.644 --> 05:48.409
How did you, could you have been drafted? Did you 
get a sort of selective service card or something?

05:51.893 --> 05:55.557
Or had you become a citizen at that point? I could 
have. I'm not following it. Had you become a

05:58.050 --> 06:00.092
citizen of the United States? Had you not been a 
fugitive citizen? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I could have

06:01.953 --> 06:04.155
been probably drafted. I was only in my, what, 30s, 
maybe. Yeah, you could have. I was in the

06:08.539 --> 06:12.662
borderline, her brother. Did you ever consider 
getting citizenship? Yeah, I would like to. There

06:16.145 --> 06:25.493
was a way, you know, a way without having to go 
through the, as I understand it, you know, the, The

06:26.620 --> 06:31.185
jail and the deportation and all that kind of 
stuff. That's not going to happen. Nobody's

06:34.349 --> 06:36.972
moving anywhere until it's pinned down. Hopes 
were really high for a while there when they

06:37.632 --> 06:49.786
started about general pardon for these illegal 
aliens, but it's all stopped again, you know, so

06:37.632 --> 06:49.786
that you wouldn't have to go through this and just, 
you know, come out of that. That I would do, you see.

06:52.237 --> 07:01.567
If some emperor would say, OK, I'm going to pardon 
these people and we start fresh and get this

06:52.237 --> 07:01.567
paperwork done, I don't remember how. Wouldn't it 
be nice when you get a letter from the Attorney

07:01.587 --> 07:06.933
General's office in Washington saying that... 
I'm pardoned. ...Georg Gettner, a.k.a. Peter

07:11.778 --> 07:13.320
Peterson, a.k.a. Dennis Wiles, no outstanding 
wants, warrants, no charges. All charges have

07:18.206 --> 07:20.488
been dropped. may apply for citizenship at any 
opportunity. Signed, Edwin Meese, Attorney

07:25.840 --> 07:31.867
General.

07:31.927 --> 07:34.389
I don't think it's that far off. No, I don't think 
it's that far off. Well, it's the fats and the fire,

07:36.772 --> 07:45.261
so...

07:36.772 --> 07:45.261
Oh, I don't think that there's... But it's not up to 
me anymore, so... Well, it still is. It still is up

07:49.165 --> 07:51.551
to you. It's still up to you until the moment

07:51.932 --> 07:59.830
you decide to do whatever you want to do. Because 
you can say... I can do it. I want to do it. It's

08:03.158 --> 08:03.840
just... Because you always know that you can 
change your name and disappear in a matter of

08:04.462 --> 08:08.809
moments. Nobody will ever hear from you. And you 
could go any place and be anybody again. I think,

08:14.117 --> 08:17.061
Arnie, I think those days will pass too. I think 
that's behind me, I'm afraid. It's like my skiing

08:18.664 --> 08:20.286
days are behind me. It's not afraid at all. I think 
it's a very healthy sign. It's like the

08:23.591 --> 08:27.297
caterpillar that sheds its skin and comes out a 
butterfly. I think it's a very real... That's a

08:27.867 --> 08:30.391
nice way to describe it. Yeah, I think so. I think 
it's... I did shed my skin, and I go, that's very

08:32.714 --> 08:35.619
good. Yeah, and the butterfly that's underneath 
comes out. Yeah, that's true. It's not something

08:40.446 --> 08:52.224
that... A child, you can push and nag and hit, but 
it's not going to walk until all the skills are in

08:40.446 --> 08:52.224
place, and it stands up and takes a few steps. And I 
think it's the same thing with changes like this.

08:55.610 --> 09:25.077
like with changing from peter peterson to dennis 
wilds there's a point in which it is necessary to

08:55.610 --> 09:25.077
shed the skin the snake skin and move to the next 
stage and i think this is exactly you must be

08:55.610 --> 09:25.077
comfortable growing comfortable with it yeah 
otherwise you wouldn't yeah be willing to shed

08:55.610 --> 09:25.077
your skin for the next stage

08:55.610 --> 09:25.077
because you know that nothing's going to happen 
first you can always disappear and you can always

08:55.610 --> 09:25.077
just uh become George Glotz and disappear. That's 
the enemy.

09:34.331 --> 09:34.712
There's no... I don't see any difficulty at all in 
any case. You're not making a move until

09:38.137 --> 09:42.043
everything is pinned down.

09:45.528 --> 09:46.970
I don't... You're not put in jeopardy at all?

09:50.796 --> 09:51.317
You know, it's... I've got a post office box 
number, and you can disappear at any time. So don't

10:00.610 --> 10:05.415
feel that you're on a train that's got no way to get 
off. But I think it's nice to stay on.

10:12.601 --> 10:18.566
Well, now that I've found my family in Germany, 
things have changed in that respect. I didn't

10:18.627 --> 10:20.308
think I had any left.

10:25.925 --> 10:31.451
And Jane is very supportive in everything. I'll 
bet people will contact you for psychological

10:31.471 --> 10:36.356
studies of fugitive years. Agencies may come to 
you to find out how to tighten up their procedures

10:37.277 --> 10:44.664
to keep illegal aliens out. I have a feeling that 
you're... Because you have an experience that

10:45.806 --> 10:50.931
nobody else has. You're the longest running FBI 
fugitive. And they told that to me with a little

10:55.810 --> 10:59.996
awe. It was Bill Tribble who was there. Do you know, 
he said, that your man is the longest future on the

11:02.259 --> 11:08.888
FBI list? We've never had anybody that's been out 
for 38 years. No, they haven't. he would

11:15.773 --> 11:45.493
love you

11:15.773 --> 11:45.493
to

11:15.773 --> 11:45.493
call he

11:15.773 --> 11:45.493
would love you to call

11:45.473 --> 11:52.165
Yes,

11:45.473 --> 11:52.165
I understand that, but he's not going to trace 
anything. He will be the first one I call. That's

11:54.489 --> 11:56.092
got to be well coordinated. Not because they have 
any plans. They don't. But they don't want to be

12:00.520 --> 12:03.104
caught unaware. The best way to befriend the 
authorities is to make sure that they know It's

12:08.845 --> 12:11.849
what they can say if they are called and asked. And 
that everybody has to, we have to get the ducks in

12:11.869 --> 12:15.794
the right line before we shoot. Get all the ducks in 
a row. Oh, yes. Oh,

12:20.740 --> 12:25.626
sure. Everybody has to move at the same time. And 
then all it's going to be is, that's the

12:30.493 --> 12:33.216
protection. is that everything, there can't be 
any slippage, behind the scenes injustices or

12:33.365 --> 12:41.467
anything like that. And like I said, you might get 
sued by 75 people whose names are Dennis Wilds. You

12:47.163 --> 12:48.707
may get...

12:51.539 --> 12:54.923
Letters from the Jewish Defense League? Could be 
anything. Did you cover that while it was gone

12:56.465 --> 13:04.876
yesterday or the day before you asked how did you 
come up with the name Dennis Walz? Yeah, we covered

13:04.896 --> 13:06.878
that. Yeah, we did too. Like I say, I have nothing 
but good feelings toward my friend

13:07.419 --> 13:21.276
Herb Lipkin who taught me everything about 
business and made business an interesting thing,

13:21.644 --> 13:30.114
which is more than anybody else could have done. 
But I never thought about being a businessman in a

13:30.134 --> 13:33.338
sense. But he made it fun in a very personal manner. 
I've loved it ever since. And then you bumped into

13:41.708 --> 13:44.351
her client. Yeah. No, actually, her client 
before. I see. And, well... Bill Klein, yeah, and

13:50.146 --> 14:04.888
they were strictly skiing and all I had to do was be a 
good skier and a good instructor and that he didn't

13:50.146 --> 14:04.888
get any complaints from the students and stay away 
from these rich girls. You asked me to remind you to

14:05.028 --> 14:08.513
tell the story about Peddler Hill. I didn't tell 
the Peddler Hill story. Oh, Peddler Hill. I'd

14:12.479 --> 14:14.382
forgotten that little place that when I was, I 
thought I did, I think we may have that on the tape.

14:21.216 --> 14:22.998
Tell me two or three things about it. I was looking 
for a place where I could have my own ski school. And

14:29.427 --> 14:35.354
I found that place called Peddler Hill in the Gold 
Country in the National Forest. And with a couple

14:35.374 --> 14:39.059
of rope tours. And the owner of this place, and I 
can't think of his name right now, but he was a very

14:44.720 --> 14:48.563
little short guy, very feisty, cute little 
fellow, gray hair. Well, he wasn't that old in

14:49.444 --> 14:54.809
those days, probably, but he was older than I was. 
And a very lively fellow. And he says, sure, we need

14:57.391 --> 14:59.753
a guy here. You can get your sign up there and open 
your ski school. And he just finished a little

15:07.320 --> 15:13.545
lodge, and just dormitories, women and men, and a 
bar. Was

15:14.048 --> 15:20.961
it Sonora that was wide open gambling? You had to go 
through Pedley Hill. Is that Sonora? Yeah,

15:26.352 --> 15:27.955
Sonora. Yeah, Silver Lake is about it. It's a Kit 
Carson Pass. It's one of the passes that goes over.

15:34.648 --> 15:35.770
Kit Carson Pass. And Sonora, a really old town, 
they were gambling in red light districts when I

15:36.323 --> 15:42.797
was there. Excellent food, wide open town. We had 
to go through Sonora to get to that. Jackson? Was it

15:52.675 --> 15:54.837
Jackson, not Sonora? Jackson. Jackson was a town, 
a wide open town. And the Filipino and the farm

16:01.402 --> 16:08.588
laborers would come and support the gambling and 
the rest of it. And

16:08.748 --> 16:17.996
so one day, on a Sunday afternoon, I had one 
student. Everybody was going, driving home. It

16:19.618 --> 16:22.480
was very close to Oakland. This gal student I had 
was a doctor, psychiatrist, a young lady,

16:22.865 --> 16:34.876
probably in her late 20s, early 30s. And she said, 
all of a sudden, out of the clear blue sky, she says,

16:34.896 --> 16:48.207
Dennis, I want you to stay with me because Mr. 
so-and-so, I can't think of his name, has been

16:34.896 --> 16:48.207
making passes at me. She's been there all week. She 
was going to stay another week. And I was kind of

16:52.514 --> 16:54.476
leery of that. That's kind of a strange thing. I 
can't believe that. He's married. He's got his

16:57.199 --> 16:58.200
wife there. He's got his daughter there. He's got 
his daughter has a trial. She's divorced, all

17:01.943 --> 17:03.905
right, but she has a boyfriend there. So he's got a 
lot of family. He wouldn't go around making

17:06.268 --> 17:07.789
passes. Well, I said, OK. I said, OK, well, let's go 
into the bar and have some drinks and go into the

17:11.153 --> 17:17.299
bar. You could see 90 miles to Yosemite. And I guess 
we had some dinner, went back to the bar, and he kind

17:23.395 --> 17:32.551
of came around a couple of times wanting to know how 
things were. And she kept saying, you know, you've

17:32.571 --> 17:36.118
got to stay with me tonight. It's been coming and 
passing. So good old Dennis said, OK. So I sneaked

17:41.568 --> 17:45.615
into the women's dorm. About what year was this?

17:55.238 --> 18:00.303
51,

17:55.238 --> 18:00.303
50, 51. And we waited in the dark. We waited and 
waited and just whispered and talked. In the lower

18:09.934 --> 18:10.495
box. In the lower box, right. You've heard the 
story before. Today. Oh. And then. I see. Do we get

18:20.078 --> 18:21.460
to see the Polaroids, too? And, my gosh, if we 
didn't hear clunk, clunk, clunk. It was a wooden

18:26.565 --> 18:30.250
building, you know, because it was somewhere down 
the steps. Well, nobody had any business in the

18:30.270 --> 18:33.974
women's dorm, including myself. Well, sure 
enough, here he comes. He comes up to me and looks

18:39.560 --> 18:40.501
around in the dark. He strikes a match, and he sees 
me there. You know, he was totally in shock. What

18:49.745 --> 18:50.446
are you doing? Just talking.

18:55.712 --> 18:57.273
Oh, everything all right? Yeah, everything's all 
right. And he followed that. So she was right. He

19:06.523 --> 19:08.846
was going to make a pass. But the after thing was, he 
was very, his wife started to get mad at me for some

19:10.968 --> 19:18.857
reason, making nasty remarks about me. It's been 
hard to get along with them. So one day I said, what

19:22.240 --> 19:26.987
is the problem? And he said, oh, you've been making 
passes at our dear customers. And so I said, wait a

19:32.714 --> 19:34.096
minute. Wait a minute. That's not the way the story 
goes. He said, we told you that. Your husband told

19:38.182 --> 19:40.204
me. I said, OK. Who told you? Her husband told her. I 
was doing things. So I said, well, and I rattled on

19:44.190 --> 19:48.355
him. Oh, she said, well, he's done that before. Oh, 
I see. I see. Who was this person we're talking

19:53.536 --> 19:55.218
about? The owner of Peddler Hill. I see. Right. So

19:59.125 --> 20:04.453
that was it. It

20:05.615 --> 20:13.405
was really a good scene if you could see that match. 
The two of you lying on the lower bunk, whispering.

20:19.834 --> 20:23.679
Well, you would have clothes on no matter what in 
this climate. That's why there's such a small

20:24.360 --> 20:32.211
population up

20:24.360 --> 20:32.211
there. Does that sound reasonable to you? The 
other

20:34.167 --> 20:53.864
time,

20:34.167 --> 20:53.864
the other one was the German Countess. The reason I 
know that this guy, was making a password because

20:53.884 --> 21:03.432
she had given me the key to her room. So I was in the 
room, and they were arguing outside the room

21:04.070 --> 21:09.257
whether he could come in. So I know. So you were 
already inside. I was already inside. How did you

21:15.345 --> 21:19.130
get so lucky that you were always inside? I don't 
know. Just lucky. You've got to be lucky. Forget

21:22.053 --> 21:24.036
all that other stuff. not to press your advantage? 
We don't know whether he pressed his advantage or

21:28.982 --> 21:32.947
not. Yes. See, one of the nice things about an 
interview, one of the interesting things about an

21:34.109 --> 21:39.877
interview is that people screen out the things 
that they don't want. Yeah, selective. Sure,

21:42.521 --> 21:43.502
sure. And this is going to tell me, yeah, and at that 
time I did this and that sleazy, you know, we all do

21:43.562 --> 21:48.969
things.

21:52.735 --> 21:53.736
Well, I was going to I'm working up to getting as 
realistic as I can. I really am. I'm trying to...

21:59.050 --> 22:05.886
Because I know it's silly. Of course, nowadays, I 
guess they're much more open about these things

22:07.942 --> 22:13.449
anyway. Our code was, father told me, you can do it, 
but don't talk about it. Don't talk about her to

22:21.519 --> 22:25.023
anybody about it. That was our code. I grew up with 
the same thing. A gentleman does not discuss this

22:30.723 --> 22:32.745
thing. Nor does the lady, actually. We were 
struggling with this. The lady wasn't involved in

22:36.350 --> 22:38.953
any of it. Very good. Very good. You're a neck of the 
woods. You were the lady if you were involved.

22:44.339 --> 22:46.101
That's good. Let me ask you, who was the first 
person that you remember helping you? Was it

22:49.726 --> 23:00.679
Herb Lipkin, or was it Bill Klein, or was it Dennis 
Wilds, or was it... Who's the first person you

22:49.726 --> 23:00.679
remember... helping you in some important way. 
Migrant years, I think that family that took me in,

23:09.721 --> 23:24.541
the Arkansas family, the Oklahoma family, took me 
in and they took me all the way to Oregon for that

23:09.721 --> 23:24.541
apple picking. And I got that job, separate from 
them, I got that job on the ranch. But I would have

23:31.370 --> 23:38.479
never gotten up there.

23:39.438 --> 23:43.023
Winter of 45, maybe spring of 46. They, I think they 
had a pickup truck or something, sleep in the back.

23:50.675 --> 23:51.496
Transportation. And you, your earnings go to the 
gas, you know, to throw in the pot full of food. But

24:01.051 --> 24:08.081
to be taken in and not to be hassled, to have, you 
know, they know where, they knew where the jobs

24:01.051 --> 24:08.081
were. I didn't. where to go. I mean, most of the 
time, nobody would know that these things,

24:11.207 --> 24:15.732
they're still existing today. Ted Roth is still 
being traveled, I'm sure. And they respected your

24:20.699 --> 24:24.443
privacy.

24:25.665 --> 24:25.925
Yeah. Did you know when you first met him that he'd 
also been a white reporter? That was all screened

24:29.309 --> 24:30.631
out. That was all screened out. That's another 
skin that I shed. You don't remember the name of

24:33.755 --> 24:39.702
that family, that first family? Just Arkansas 
family. Yeah,

24:42.883 --> 24:48.569
it was kind of an older man. He had a tooth missing. 
And that weathered look, you know, with the

24:51.372 --> 25:01.203
outdoor light, you know, and the cowboy hat and the 
woman. Also that weathered look.

25:08.538 --> 25:09.880
Tall folks, small folks? A little bit. He was 
fairly tall. He was a little bit, I would say he was

25:11.543 --> 25:17.312
five foot six, eight. I thought he was tall, almost 
six feet. And she was probably five foot four.

25:30.931 --> 25:35.037
And they were a very close family, you know. They 
were always together, he and she. They were more

25:37.441 --> 25:40.325
than ten feet apart. And that was a good sight, you 
know, to see the basic social fabric of a family and

25:41.627 --> 25:56.550
be offered to be part of a family again, you know. 
instead of being in the military camp, what have

25:57.188 --> 26:02.654
you. Did they have children? Yeah, they had some 
young boys, and then they had this daughter who was

26:03.875 --> 26:13.225
quite pretty, but she had a lot of acne at the time, 
unfortunately. She was quite pretty otherwise.

26:15.187 --> 26:19.091
She was probably 18, somewhere in there. They 
always made little jokes about her and me, and she

26:19.111 --> 26:26.419
would get blush and run and hide the... They, 
wherever we lived, whether it was a motel, a place

26:27.361 --> 26:37.013
that the farmers supply their migrant laborers. 
Or labor camps. Labor camps. Oh, I see. They supply

26:41.258 --> 26:45.884
a cabin to the families, you see, free. Or, I don't 
know, charge my dad with the rent. But they would

26:48.725 --> 26:52.972
compartment off little bedrooms. These are 
one-room shacks usually, kitchen or sink of some

26:53.012 --> 26:58.321
kind. And they'd hang blankets to make the rooms 
out of it for their daughters and for themselves. I

27:06.255 --> 27:10.222
remember the time they joked about us, too. You 
know, she got all red in the face. threw up the

27:12.552 --> 27:15.738
blanket and disappeared into her little bedroom. 
To fantasize, probably, about it being true. Like

27:22.432 --> 27:24.195
I say, she had nice features. Just going through 
the age of her acting, you understand. Nice smile,

27:29.646 --> 27:31.810
very sweet. Was there anything between you, any 
conversations, special talk? It was more their

27:38.091 --> 27:41.056
jokes, which were just part of the unit. Part of the 
unit, and I would just be very quiet and listen and

27:41.076 --> 27:49.992
say yes and thank you. Keep my conversation down to 
a minimum. They would try to draw me out and I would

27:53.017 --> 27:57.865
try to respond. But, you know, because my 
vocabulary is so limited,

27:58.283 --> 28:08.319
you don't always have the pieces to tell a story. 
You have a story, but there's one or two words

28:08.379 --> 28:12.746
missing, and there's no story. You're just stuck. 
You can't tell it. Even not to this day. Sometimes a

28:16.632 --> 28:20.578
word doesn't come that would fit into that story. 
It makes you mad, you know, you just don't have it

28:21.638 --> 28:25.621
like that. Vocabulary or just general? I see. Even 
to this day, I have to rearrange the story again to

28:30.205 --> 28:36.111
talk around it. I do, too. You do that? Sure. I can't 
think of the right word. Yeah, I guess it's not

28:39.333 --> 28:46.680
that... Oh, I do it all the time. I still don't think 
the picture of the mom and dad in this family, were

28:46.700 --> 28:50.363
they overweight, underweight? He was very lean, 
lean body, and I think she was a little more stout.

28:58.937 --> 29:01.580
But no real fat, no. They worked too hard in the 
fields and in the trees. They were both very tough,

29:04.244 --> 29:12.075
leathery, and I don't know whether strong people. 
And the kids were really nice, lively boys. and I

29:20.228 --> 29:34.503
was kind of, became the oldest boy almost in it, 
because I looked fairly young, always, no matter

29:20.228 --> 29:34.503
how old I was, I looked always four, five years 
younger than I was, you know. So I was kind of an

29:34.523 --> 29:45.915
older brother to the boys, would play with them or 
be interested in what they were doing, which the

29:34.523 --> 29:45.915
parents weren't, you know. So they gave me some 
kind of... I found a place in the hierarchy of this

29:49.040 --> 29:52.626
family. That's nice.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.817
What kind of clothes did they wear? Jeans, just 
torn jeans.

30:05.246 --> 30:08.190
No, I think they wore dresses in those days. I don't 
think they wore jeans.

30:12.076 --> 30:15.261
And the print dresses, very much just... Grapes of 
wrath, washed out, all torn, teeth missing,

30:15.781 --> 30:31.237
everybody had some kind of problem, probably 
because of the diet, not a balanced diet. This was

30:31.257 --> 30:34.581
close enough to the war years so they may have asked 
you what you did during the war. Never came up.

30:35.922 --> 30:36.523
Never came up. If you'd been in the war or sitting 
around the table talking about conversations

30:37.684 --> 30:43.290
when people said that they were in the They had not. 
He was too old, obviously. His kids were too young.

30:51.459 --> 31:00.150
Did you ever find yourself sitting in a bar where 
someone is telling stories about shooting up the

30:51.459 --> 31:00.150
Krauts in 1943? Constantly. Really?

31:05.656 --> 31:12.585
And you've kept not a word about your opinion of 
when they mispronounce... Rommel's name or they

31:13.139 --> 31:20.230
mispronounce Luftwaffe or Babel. Surprisingly, 
very few of them really said anything bad other

31:20.972 --> 31:37.999
than, I mean bad that would affect me other than 
that they would say something.

31:41.084 --> 31:46.273
But it wasn't nearly as bad as the newspapers. The 
newspapers were hard to read because of all the

31:46.814 --> 31:55.549
border stories, day after day. It was hard to read. 
Who wants to be part of that? Certainly,

32:00.818 --> 32:01.799
certainly. Running with the migrant workers, Did 
you ever find yourself badly treated? Were you

32:08.217 --> 32:17.335
robbed, or beaten, or badly treated, or had your 
shoes stolen, or things that would happen on a

32:08.217 --> 32:17.335
migrant life?

32:21.322 --> 32:24.709
Very much in those days. They had made it through 
the war. Some of them might have gone and made a

32:27.885 --> 32:32.650
little money in the defense plans, maybe. When 
they started closing down, they probably had to go

32:32.910 --> 32:38.756
back to their regular lives. So I get the picture of 
you during those days as being a loner, being very

32:38.776 --> 32:50.587
quiet, keeping to yourself, attaching yourself 
from one group to another, family if possible.

32:50.647 --> 32:52.389
Because I liked the human contact. Yes. You know, I 
mean, it was fun to... to sit there in this room

32:55.840 --> 33:09.334
before or after dinner and have boys playing and 
yakking away, you know, the older people talking

32:55.840 --> 33:09.334
to themselves and have something going on. What 
have

33:11.356 --> 33:17.702
I given up? What have I lost? Pretty, yeah, pretty, 
a lot of grief. having lost my family and my home

33:24.511 --> 33:48.882
town and the whole clinic was very very hard to 
overcome and that's why I try to read all these

33:24.511 --> 33:48.882
books to make sure that my head stays straight on 
and that I you know there must be some other there

33:24.511 --> 33:48.882
must be some way of getting over this, this cannot, 
you know, go on forever to, to weep over your

33:49.368 --> 34:06.527
family, the loss of your family, the loss of your, 
everything you've ever known and had,

33:49.368 --> 34:06.527
you know. So it, it, you, then you read stories that 
had happened to other people, not just me, Not just

34:13.702 --> 34:15.023
the Germans. It happened to other nationalities. 
And it just got better. Of course, as time went on,

34:21.390 --> 34:24.153
it went all over the world. It never stopped. 
Somebody has the same problem as I have. So I have

34:30.900 --> 34:42.072
you going up to, leaving Deming, then going to, 
taking the train to the West Coast. looking for a

34:42.659 --> 34:47.887
port, searching out a ship, finding yourself with 
this family. The family took you up for the season

34:47.927 --> 34:53.215
for the... Apple. Apple up to Medford, Oregon. The 
apple season wasn't ready yet because this had to

34:56.520 --> 35:00.607
be still early spring. And on the weather, yeah. 
Weather. Then they put you to work on the logs,

35:02.690 --> 35:07.317
cutting the logs. The part of the axe hurt your leg. 
They took you to the hospital. You left early. And

35:13.386 --> 35:18.373
then you decided to go down to Mexico and see if you 
could cross over there. I probably went to San

35:18.393 --> 35:21.117
Francisco then to make some money. So I had to have 
another stake and another new plan.

35:28.207 --> 35:32.373
And try another way out, probably. So after one 
season, then you gave it to try crossing the

35:32.713 --> 35:36.839
Mexican border. Yeah. You are Peter Peterson.

35:42.443 --> 35:43.525
Yeah, I think I still was. Peter Peterson, you went 
down to try to get across the Mexican frontier,

35:43.545 --> 35:51.778
changed your mind when you saw the dark side and all 
it represented or didn't represent. And then you

35:52.239 --> 35:57.107
turned around and did the self-inflicted 
amputation. Now you're not going to go across the

35:57.127 --> 35:59.411
border. You are committing yourself to staying in 
the country and just laying low. And making a life.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.343
To simply get on with my life. As a life. I mean, you 
know, on a day-to-day basis. To create a fairly

36:13.489 --> 36:18.075
decent day, day after day. String the days, the 
good days together. And then you joined up with

36:23.582 --> 36:25.965
Dennis Wiles. Did the San Joaquin Valley. And then 
when you were doing 47. On toward 48. When you, as

36:35.131 --> 36:44.504
Peter Peterson, 48 to 49, I see that you spent one 
season with... She has a... I think that would help

36:45.004 --> 36:48.669
a little bit. It would help you in a certain way. Oh, 
good. For instance, I don't remember what I did for

36:55.459 --> 36:58.863
the Central Lumber Company. This was in 19... 
Here's what I heard from the general. I must have

37:03.008 --> 37:07.493
had a part-time job. The 47

37:07.553 --> 37:22.071
shows Clinton Cafeteria

37:07.553 --> 37:22.071
and Sugar Bowl. It shows a lot. The 47. $411. 
Central Library Company stocked it in 1947. The

37:23.573 --> 37:27.898
Wonder was a department store, and I was a window 
decorator. And that didn't last very long. So you

37:31.262 --> 37:32.323
were already... Dennis Wiles, because you had 
your own social security number, if they better

37:32.624 --> 37:36.693
survive. Yeah, yeah. So Dennis Wiles. I told you to 
run out and get the social security card. Who did?

37:44.008 --> 37:44.409
Clinton. Why didn't Clinton? Here's Clinton, 
1947. We've got nothing earlier, so that must have

37:46.739 --> 37:50.946
happened. Yeah, so they probably said, no, you've 
got to have one. Here's the paper, fill it out, and

37:55.292 --> 38:00.661
I'll come back in a half hour, pick it up, or 
something like that. Boom, you're on duty. So you

38:03.845 --> 38:06.630
just fill it out. Right, right.

38:10.536 --> 38:11.417
It wasn't all that long. I thought there was no 
time. And I have no idea what it is, but I can't

38:13.242 --> 38:21.150
remember who incorporated it. Stanford 
suggested it. No, Stanford, Connecticut. That's

38:25.954 --> 38:29.718
Connecticut.

38:29.738 --> 38:30.699
Yeah, that's an insurance group. I don't know if 
you might have heard of the home base. They may be

38:35.683 --> 38:36.704
there, yeah, because I wasn't. I've been to 
Connecticut a lot. Yeah.

38:42.520 --> 38:59.424
50.

38:59.444 --> 39:07.195
I

38:59.444 --> 39:07.195
worked up there, but as an independent. I didn't 
work for Bill anymore, I worked for myself. 50, 51,

39:16.977 --> 39:17.738
52. 52 was a train thing. 53,

39:20.882 --> 39:28.973
I think I stayed a couple more years after that 
before I quit that skiing business. So that would

39:29.573 --> 39:32.237
make it 54, and that's probably... We don't have 
those 54 ones, do we? The rest of it, up to date, do

39:36.726 --> 39:40.132
we? All of them, or we didn't request them? Yeah, 
because then it would show, when I went to work for

39:41.755 --> 39:51.110
Bill Klein, I mean for Herb Lipkin, would have to be 
54-55. So you stopped paying Social Security tax

39:53.975 --> 39:56.740
after 54? No. No. Well, it's

39:58.988 --> 40:13.845
just on a different

39:58.988 --> 40:13.845
sheet. Yeah. It just doesn't show the employers. 
They should

40:16.367 --> 40:21.693
probably remember in those later years. Yeah, I'm 
not sure. I'm saying some of those years where they

40:22.114 --> 40:23.576
would just report the minutes . I think you could . 
And I worked for, in 1949, for the Carter-Hawley

40:24.985 --> 40:33.716
stores, Haley stores, on Broadway stores in Los 
Angeles. That was when I taught tennis there and

40:35.218 --> 40:41.946
briefly worked for that department store. And I 
was, they were terrifying me, those stores with

40:41.966 --> 40:52.039
the bells, and I just felt inadequate in my job. I 
did not feel that I could really function or do what

40:52.508 --> 40:58.999
I was doing. These other things were just 
interfering. Everything was driving me crazy in

41:01.123 --> 41:06.051
these places.

41:08.295 --> 41:11.741
I mean, they're lovely places, these stores, but I 
couldn't relax. I was nervous as a cat.

41:21.382 --> 41:31.797
You never had any response to World War II movies, 
the Holocaust series on television, or the movie

41:21.382 --> 41:31.797
The Desert Fox. I remember with James Mason. I may 
have seen parts of it. But you didn't gravitate

41:36.003 --> 41:41.972
toward those movies to see how they were 
portraying what you did or that you were doing. You

41:42.273 --> 41:44.496
stayed away from them for particular reasons? No, 
I didn't want to go backwards on those.

41:52.168 --> 41:57.756
I really got into this self-healing process. And 
if you want to heal yourself, you cannot go back to

41:59.138 --> 42:08.773
scratch your scab, your wound, constantly. It 
won't heal. And I try to do this with the kids when

42:12.884 --> 42:19.090
they get in, raising kids. Get them going on the 
positive and string the good days together. Don't

42:25.657 --> 42:30.001
louse it up with bad vibes. If you can help it, 
you're going to get them. You're going to get your

42:34.505 --> 42:39.330
bad vibes whether you want to or not. What hobbies 
did you do? Painting, I know. Did you develop any

42:44.818 --> 42:46.160
other hobbies? Oh, yeah. Which is what kind of 
painting? Did you use different media? Did you

42:52.465 --> 42:55.508
have specific paper subjects? Well, now that you 
mention it, Candy, at first I really went into

42:55.528 --> 43:03.615
inventing things because I needed to make money. 
And I wanted to make more money and, you know, more

43:04.555 --> 43:08.659
and more money. So I invented things. Like in Los 
Angeles, so now I know what year it was, 1949. In Los

43:13.554 --> 43:30.309
Angeles, I remember I saw all these convertibles 
and they were always open and people would have

43:13.554 --> 43:30.309
things stolen or they would have problems in the 
paper. It didn't look right to me. So I came up and I

43:31.491 --> 43:35.434
said, well, that's easy enough. And I thought, a 
roll-top desk and I thought, you know, why don't we

43:36.753 --> 43:54.348
just get a roll-top type desk that disappears in 
the back and you just grab it and you pull it up and it

43:36.753 --> 43:54.348
locks in the front and keeps the sun off your seat 
and you can have your packages in there. Like a

43:54.368 --> 43:55.970
window shade almost. Like a window shade with 
little slats, you know. So that it could roll up,

44:01.494 --> 44:03.396
yeah. Out of wood maybe. whatever. And so I made up 
little drawings and I make up these drawings and

44:08.352 --> 44:20.986
send them to General Motors and two or three months 
later you get them back unopened. We do not solicit

44:21.026 --> 44:22.889
outside ideas. We have our own research 
department. So and constantly I would have these

44:26.092 --> 44:35.143
things and some of them I would copyright and Some 
of them I even tried to get patents on, hoping to

44:35.630 --> 44:46.429
find something that would make me some money so I 
wouldn't have to work for other people. I noticed

44:47.490 --> 44:58.870
you put a copyright C on the cover that you drew for

44:47.490 --> 44:58.870
the kitchen.

45:00.115 --> 45:10.567
I got into copyright laws and patent laws, trying 
to come up with something.

45:11.468 --> 45:21.159
I invented that toy, and then I got into the 
baseball toy, and then the aluminum tennis

45:11.468 --> 45:21.159
racket, which was going to make me rich. But I was 
ten years too early. I did all the pioneer work,

45:24.702 --> 45:30.230
calling on these people and they were calling me 
crazy. So I learned a lot about the mystery of the

45:31.852 --> 45:35.878
American marketplace. How it functions or how it 
does not function. And it did help me later on

45:42.046 --> 45:52.060
because I did get into marketing and I was more 
successful with marketing for Morris & Knudsen

45:42.046 --> 45:52.060
than I was because I had the The searching ability, 
you know, how to search out your... If I have a

45:58.087 --> 46:01.312
product, I can do something with it. But I was 
trying to do too much. I was inventing a new product

46:02.774 --> 46:10.304
and upsetting people by replacing wooden tennis 
racket, which, of course, I didn't realize. You

46:10.324 --> 46:14.930
cannot threaten an industry by replacing their 
product. But I didn't know that. And I didn't know

46:16.872 --> 46:20.477
that Wilson does not make any tennis rackets. 
Wilson buys tennis rackets.
