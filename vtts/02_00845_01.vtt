WEBVTT

00:01.398 --> 00:07.724
information on yourself, like your name and where 
you were born and when you were born, if you don't

00:01.398 --> 00:07.724
mind? Well, I don't usually tell that. Well, 
that's just fine. But I was born in Madisonville,

00:11.567 --> 00:19.274
Texas, over here just 45 miles from College 
Station. My family moved to Amarillo, Texas, when

00:19.534 --> 00:23.698
I was quite young. And my father practiced law in 
Amarillo. I went through public schools in

00:28.862 --> 00:31.084
Amarillo. And then went to West Texas State for two 
years and then to the University of Texas for two

00:31.672 --> 00:44.950
years where I received my degree in French and 
Latin of all the things. But I used those later

00:46.432 --> 01:01.392
because I taught for a while in Amarillo and then I 
came to Bryan to teach in Bryan High School and I

00:46.432 --> 01:01.392
taught French and Latin in Bryan High School. But 
that didn't last too long because I met my

01:01.945 --> 01:08.411
husband-to-be the day after I arrived in Bryan. 
I've always thought that was kind of interesting.

01:13.136 --> 01:15.418
We were married then in 1929. And

01:15.498 --> 01:25.928
he had his master's degree, his bachelor's and his 
master's degrees from the University of Chicago.

01:26.748 --> 01:31.733
But he always had the ambition to get that PhD. 
because he was teaching here in the chemistry

01:32.354 --> 01:36.300
department. He wanted the PhD. So we went to 
Colorado the first summer after he was married.

01:42.711 --> 01:50.503
And he tried to get a degree program set up at the 
University of Colorado, but he wasn't satisfied.

01:50.523 --> 01:59.357
So the next six summers, we went to Chicago, and he 
completed the clerk for his PhD. They told him at

02:00.164 --> 02:12.636
that time that it was the best thing for him to come 
in summers because of the fact that

02:00.164 --> 02:12.636
that was depression time. And if he had a job, he 
ought to keep it. They said, we'll take care of you

02:15.538 --> 02:17.840
in the summers. But we don't want you giving up a job 
to come up here and finish it in the required time it

02:17.860 --> 02:25.187
would take for long sessions. He received his 
degree. And 37. We have two sons. One of them went

02:38.226 --> 02:40.629
three years to A&M. The other one went four years to 
A&M. Both have completed degrees and are doctors.

02:48.997 --> 02:53.022
One is a pediatrician in Denver, Colorado. The 
other is a psychiatrist and has just recently

02:53.662 --> 02:58.167
moved to Bryan. He

03:00.340 --> 03:12.476
built our home in 1936 and lived in this house ever 
since. So the reason you came to Bryan, did your

03:12.496 --> 03:17.002
family move here? No, I had relatives in Bryan, and 
they persuaded me to come here and teach. In fact,

03:25.152 --> 03:29.638
they helped secure the job for me because at that 
time it was hard to get a job. job for a teacher. And

03:33.247 --> 03:40.758
the curious thing about it, they would not let 
women who were married teach in the Bryan schools

03:33.247 --> 03:40.758
at that time. So when we were married, I had to give 
up my job teaching. Now, all women that want to

03:46.326 --> 03:53.636
teach can if they're equipped for it. OK. When you 
came here, what was the town of Bryan College

03:54.878 --> 03:58.343
Station Combined like it is now, or was it College 
Station small? Oh, no, it wasn't very much between

04:02.238 --> 04:04.260
the two.

04:09.907 --> 04:12.250
College Station hadn't grown up very much. In 
fact, when we built this house, there was nothing

04:12.270 --> 04:17.215
south of us. Now it just extends for miles out south 
of us. But the only road to College Station at that

04:22.021 --> 04:28.448
time was the one over by the railroad track. and 
that's where you came to College Station from

04:29.525 --> 04:34.252
Bryan at that time. Later, we were very delighted 
when they opened Jersey Street and opened Texas

04:35.254 --> 04:41.544
Avenue. Texas Avenue had not extended out very 
far,

04:41.564 --> 04:52.481
but when we built here, we were about the fourth 
house on this street. About the fourth

04:52.601 --> 04:56.687
house. Well, did the Was the town of College 
Station, did it group around the main street, or

04:57.655 --> 05:02.983
was it just centered around the university 
itself? Oh, just the university. That was it.

05:06.347 --> 05:13.778
Northgate was the center of the business life of 
College Station. And at the time we moved here, no

05:13.798 --> 05:20.247
students were allowed to have cars on the campus. 
No students were allowed to have cars, we'll put it

05:20.267 --> 05:27.477
that way, because boys would come here and offer to 
rent our garage so that they could keep a car and

05:27.912 --> 05:40.527
attend school and not let the authorities know 
they had cars in this community.

05:45.213 --> 05:50.860
The East Gate didn't grow up until four years later 
after that. And the wood stores on Jersey didn't be

05:50.880 --> 05:56.687
up there until after that. been living here for a 
while. Was there a distinction between, were

05:59.561 --> 06:07.529
there different classes of people, like rich 
people, lower class? Were there distinctions

06:07.549 --> 06:11.173
between black and white at that time? At that time, 
there were some colored sections around. But the

06:16.959 --> 06:27.349
people of the university, it was the college for so 
long, were just about on the same level. I mean,

06:28.628 --> 06:35.276
financially and our homes and everything of that 
sort. We didn't have any rich people. We just had

06:37.338 --> 06:40.462
college professors are never rich. We live just 
about like everybody else around here. Well, now,

06:47.791 --> 06:55.260
do you remember any severe weather events such as 
any droughts or floods or anything of that type?

06:56.354 --> 07:02.704
No, I remember one time when the temperature 
dropped to six below zero. And people really

07:03.945 --> 07:09.514
suffered because houses aren't built here for 
that kind of weather. And many pipes froze and many

07:10.055 --> 07:12.619
pipes burst. But we were fortunate in not having 
any trouble at our home. Has the weather, like, did

07:20.418 --> 07:27.008
it used to snow here more often, or was it just about 
like it is now? Just about as it is now. We never did

07:28.490 --> 07:30.654
have snow every year. Some years we'd have heavy 
snow. Two years ago, if you were here, you'd

07:33.879 --> 07:41.330
remember that we had snow that lasted for over a 
week. But this year, I haven't seen any snow. They

07:44.435 --> 07:46.037
said there were a few flakes in the morning. Did... 
What was the town? Was it an incorporated town? Did

07:51.704 --> 07:52.665
it have a mayor? What was the political... How was 
it run? At first, we did not.

08:00.573 --> 08:07.719
Then, Mr. McNew, I believe, was the moving spirit 
in having the town incorporated.

08:12.344 --> 08:16.107
I don't remember very much about how it was run 
before that. Well, have you noticed... a shift in

08:19.818 --> 08:24.784
the livelihood activities of the people here? 
Like, has it changed from agricultural? I know the

08:28.488 --> 08:38.300
city's grown, but would you say there was about as 
many agricultural activity then as now, or was it

08:28.488 --> 08:38.300
more toward agriculture then? This has always 
been a cotton-growing country around here, and

08:38.320 --> 08:45.488
the Brazos Bottom has been the source of much of the 
wealth that has been in Bryan all these years. The

08:51.231 --> 09:00.120
farms I believe now, they are more, I think they've 
been sold to bigger corporations. There used to be

09:00.140 --> 09:04.124
lots of smaller farms in the bottom. But outside of 
that, there hasn't been too much agriculture

09:04.144 --> 09:10.792
anymore. Well now, when we moved here, were 
electricity and telephones already installed?

09:15.505 --> 09:17.087
Yes, yes. But when I first came to Bryan, there was 
no gas. All homes were heated then by, mostly by

09:24.013 --> 09:29.759
fireplaces. But they brought gas in, and old 
people were so delighted when they brought gas in,

09:29.779 --> 09:40.910
but they had electricity before I came, and sewer, 
and everything like that. You mentioned, you

09:40.930 --> 09:45.394
know, the road system, how it was just the Weldon 
Highway that connected You mentioned that they

09:45.914 --> 09:51.740
opened up Texas. Was that a highway then? Did it go 
all the way to Madison like it does now? Is that when

09:55.824 --> 09:56.545
they opened it? Not for a while. We had to go through 
Wellborn and Milliken to go to Houston before the

09:58.867 --> 10:08.056
Texas Highway was built. And

10:08.076 --> 10:15.904
I can't think what it was called before it became 
Texas. That

10:16.694 --> 10:21.080
means Houston Highway, I guess. Yeah. Do you 
remember about what time they opened the

10:22.362 --> 10:30.553
road back just around what years? No. I know that 
when we first moved here, our streets weren't

10:30.654 --> 10:33.337
paved. There was a little gravel put on them, but 
numerous people were stuck in our driveway. And in

10:39.947 --> 10:43.832
the curb, near the curb, we didn't get Really 
didn't get the curbs and gutters until, oh, the

10:44.386 --> 10:53.536
50s, I

10:44.386 --> 10:53.536
guess. College Station started a paving. Would

10:56.940 --> 11:07.251
you say that the College Station brine area has 
grown faster in the last 10 years than so before?

11:07.271 --> 11:07.711
Yes. I think the reason for that is that the 
university has grown so fast. Right now, it seems

11:14.238 --> 11:23.753
to me that it's growing faster than it ever

11:14.238 --> 11:23.753
has. The customs, you know, I'm sure they've 
changed quite a bit from back when you first came

11:23.773 --> 11:31.064
here. Let's say the food. Did most people buy their 
food, or was there a lot of growing food and selling

11:33.227 --> 11:40.498
it from the land itself? There used to be a farmer's 
market in Brown where we made it a point to go every

11:41.305 --> 11:47.291
Saturday. They had it, I believe, on Wednesday and 
Saturday. And we were able to procure fresh

11:50.875 --> 11:58.823
vegetables and fruits at times. But we were all 
delighted when the first market came in here. I

12:04.028 --> 12:07.532
think A&P was probably the first that came in. We 
noticed the prices went down in the grocery stores

12:07.883 --> 12:17.116
after this supermarket business began to come 
into our community. At that time, we could drive to

12:17.917 --> 12:29.993
Houston and buy groceries and save enough to pay 
for our trip to Houston.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.997
There was quite a chain of business there. Just a 
few old-timers had stores in Brown, and they kept

12:34.445 --> 12:42.276
the store prices high.

12:43.318 --> 12:47.043
Well, then what about the grants? I'm sure that's 
changed. Well, it's changed just as it has all over

12:48.605 --> 13:00.182
the country, because after all, America's pretty 
much the same, and particularly now since TV. And

13:00.202 --> 13:03.827
social life has changed since we've had TV. And air 
conditioning, those two things have changed. We

13:08.343 --> 13:14.510
used to visit people more than we do now, and people 
used to visit us more. And we had more of our

13:14.530 --> 13:31.989
homemade social life, I'll call it, at that time, 
because people didn't sit in front of the TV, and

13:14.530 --> 13:31.989
they weren't comfortable with the air condition 
that's the way they are now. Well, did y'all... The

13:33.288 --> 13:36.192
different people give parties back then? Yes. I 
remember soon after we were married that I would

13:36.653 --> 13:45.947
have a party, maybe have 40 or 50 people for dinner. 
I haven't done that in a long time. We could get help

13:51.115 --> 13:55.040
that would make it easier for us at that time. Well, 
what about... entertainment as far as outside

13:58.972 --> 14:01.816
people? Did College Station Bryan area get many 
what you call big name entertainers to come and

14:01.976 --> 14:08.586
visit? There has never been a time here where there 
wasn't something going on. It used to be called

14:15.356 --> 14:23.548
Town Hall and met in Gine

14:15.356 --> 14:23.548
Hall. That's where we saw plays. We heard the 
famous opera singers, and good programs were

14:29.026 --> 14:35.315
brought in at that time, just as they are now.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.763
What was the police force like? Did they have a 
police force? Did they need one about the law and

14:45.750 --> 14:48.875
order? Was it pretty well acquired? This has never 
been a very... wild community so far as crime is

14:56.347 --> 14:59.572
concerned. I've heard of a few burglaries in this 
neighborhood, but that's the only crime I've ever

15:00.513 --> 15:09.546
heard of. Okay, now what about the fire 
department? Did they have a fire department here?

15:14.913 --> 15:21.983
We had to use the college

15:14.913 --> 15:21.983
fire department. It hasn't been very many years 
that College Station itself had a real fire

15:23.228 --> 15:29.675
department. Now I think it's switched, and the 
university uses the College Station fire

15:29.695 --> 15:39.064
department now. OK. You were in the school system. 
You might mention a little bit how it was run, about

15:40.626 --> 15:48.434
not being able to be married and teach. How was the 
weather? Would you consider the school system was

15:50.515 --> 15:56.342
good for this area? Well, see, I taught in Bryan, 
and there was a separate system at College Station

15:56.362 --> 16:03.251
at the time. I thought the Bryan system was a pretty 
good system. We had about all the courses that most

16:06.855 --> 16:13.083
high schools offer now. And I thought it was a 
really good system. Because there was one high

16:17.528 --> 16:19.231
school? Oh, yes. Weren't there two schools in 
Brown at that time? One was on the west side and one

16:23.320 --> 16:31.373
was on the east side. Were the schools, did they 
have a black school and a white school? Oh, yes.

16:36.381 --> 16:39.926
Yes, the school was part of the blacks in Brown. 
Then later, I don't know about College Station

16:41.509 --> 16:48.079
schools at that time, but I know later there were. 
and Scooby-Doo

16:49.257 --> 16:57.124
as far as that at College Station. You might 
mention a little bit about the Depression. Do you

16:59.266 --> 17:13.079
remember, of course, the effects, I'm sure, 
reached everywhere in the US, but do you remember

16:59.266 --> 17:13.079
the conditions, some of the living conditions, 
like as far as transportation, means of income?

17:13.279 --> 17:16.642
Did people get along, or were they hard-pressed? 
Well, it was hard. I remember that during the

17:18.890 --> 17:33.806
Depression, my husband was paid for, since we were 
going to Chicago every summer, we were paid for his

17:18.890 --> 17:33.806
nine months. And we had to live on that money during 
the rest of the year. So there was no extravagance

17:38.551 --> 17:42.095
at that time. You can count on that. Then I believe 
that was the time when We had to discount the

17:48.185 --> 17:50.408
warrants. We were paid in warrants, and then they 
had to be discounted. We'd go up to the bank, and

17:55.455 --> 17:58.800
they'd charge us so much to cash them, you know. 
That was, it wasn't easy, because the salaries

18:00.562 --> 18:08.393
were low then, too. Well, were the prices, did they 
go up, or were they about the same as far as food?

18:14.401 --> 18:16.504
Well, they were much lower than they are today. But 
it made up, it was still harder because of the time.

18:21.756 --> 18:22.196
Oh, yes. Because

18:23.237 --> 18:30.604
of the time, it was harder. Do you remember any of 
the programs that President Roosevelt came out

18:30.684 --> 18:41.975
with affecting any of this area around here, such 
as the WPA and the RA? I can't remember that very

18:41.995 --> 18:44.297
much was done here. I have seen buildings in other 
cities. that were built at that time. I remember

18:50.483 --> 19:09.266
that my brother-in-law was a doctor and he went to a 
CC camp and worked because it was hard at that time

18:50.483 --> 19:09.266
for a doctor to

18:50.483 --> 19:09.266
make a living. What effect did Would you say that 
World War II, did it have on the community here, A&M

19:11.041 --> 19:25.397
being a military school then, did it take anything 
away from the community, or did the community have

19:11.041 --> 19:25.397
to do without as far as certain commodities? There 
was an Air Force base out from Bryan, and that

19:26.419 --> 19:39.073
brought in a lot of money to the community that 
wouldn't have been here. It was a training for

19:39.863 --> 19:46.112
fighter bombers, I believe. And that brought in 
money that helped the community here. We had the

19:50.939 --> 20:01.816
same sort of situation that was everywhere at that 
time because we had our little stamps that we used

19:50.939 --> 20:01.816
to buy food. We had the

20:07.690 --> 20:17.645
One, all in places when we'd hear there was sugar, 
several of us would go together and go to town to try

20:07.690 --> 20:17.645
to get some of that sugar that had come in. We had 
just about the same conditions here that were all

20:17.665 --> 20:23.593
over. Okay. What about the churches? Were there 
many different churches here? Just the same that

20:30.844 --> 20:32.547
there are now. There may be a few. different ones

20:36.783 --> 21:00.141
now, but the main churches were, I don't believe 
the Catholics built out here for a while, but

20:36.783 --> 21:00.141
the Church of Christ was needed at that time 
because they made it the library.

21:03.985 --> 21:20.869
I

21:03.985 --> 21:20.869
don't mean the library,

21:03.985 --> 21:20.869
I mean the YMCA. The Baptist Church was moving, the 
Methodist. I can't remember that, the Episcopal.

21:24.795 --> 21:26.938
The Presbyterian was moving at that time. What 
about, did much building go on during the

21:27.222 --> 21:37.476
Depression or during World War II as far as the 
university or the houses and communities? Did it

21:37.496 --> 21:39.538
grow much during that period of time? Not very much 
during that time. Would you say it lost or just

21:41.581 --> 21:43.964
stayed about the same? I would say it didn't stay 
about the same because where there's a school,

21:44.125 --> 21:56.601
like A&M, of course the enrollment got down. I 
don't know.

22:01.985 --> 22:17.322
I can't remember if there was much change, though, 
on account of the World War II. I was trying to

22:17.342 --> 22:19.064
think. I read a letter that my husband had written 
me when I went on a visit, and he was telling me that

22:19.084 --> 22:25.811
they thought they were going to have 5,000 
students, and they were very delighted of it. They

22:25.831 --> 22:30.456
thought that was going to be

22:25.831 --> 22:30.456
this real deal for them. What about the railroads? 
Would you say that the towns that first grew up

22:32.349 --> 22:37.234
around the railroads and then moved on to other 
places? Oh, the railroads was the center of the

22:37.655 --> 22:40.478
community. We had three trains to Dallas every 
day. There was one in the morning, one in the

22:45.725 --> 22:52.933
afternoon, and then one in the night. And to 
Houston, of course, the same number. We had two

22:55.696 --> 22:59.481
trains through here at that time. That was really 
the center of transportation at that time.

23:12.145 --> 23:17.049
Well, that's just about all the questions that I 
had, particularly. I can tell you something that

23:17.070 --> 23:19.792
was very interesting. The water in College 
Station was a sulfur calc water. And we couldn't

23:26.159 --> 23:30.463
leave any of it overnight in an aluminum pan. We 
did. We got up in the morning and saw the bubbles all

23:31.362 --> 23:35.928
over the pan. We had to watch that very carefully. 
And our silver garnished very easily from that

23:37.931 --> 23:45.481
water.

23:45.502 --> 23:48.245
We were happy when we got some new water. Did y'all 
have individual wells then? It was always piped

23:50.929 --> 23:58.299
in. We used city water. Would you say that the A&M 
changed, the college changed since the Corps

23:59.570 --> 24:09.325
wasn't mandatory? Would you say it was more 
military type then? Did that change the town? Have

24:14.332 --> 24:19.800
any effect on the town that you can remember?

24:19.820 --> 24:20.942
I don't know that it did. Maybe the social life 
among the Corps was a little more than I hear of now.

24:28.253 --> 24:28.834
I know that I have, along with many other people in 
this community, have rented rooms on weekends to

24:29.219 --> 24:41.353
girls who came for festivities on the campus. 
There were no hotels except for the old Aggieland

24:41.713 --> 24:48.561
Inn on the campus.

24:48.641 --> 24:50.824
And Brown didn't have very many hotels. So they 
used to phone and say, can you take three girls or

24:50.844 --> 24:56.751
two girls? Some family would come in and visit. Now 
it's very different with so many motels

25:00.117 --> 25:09.173
and hotels around. Would you say that most of the 
families that lived in College Station were

25:10.596 --> 25:17.849
professors to the university? Would you say 
that's what made up most of the town? Yes.

25:23.118 --> 25:24.100
It's been that way. Until recently, it seems to me 
that there are lots of people around now who are not

25:24.569 --> 25:35.861
connected with the university. And this was a 
college, and the school wasn't so large. Most of

25:39.544 --> 25:50.496
the people out here were connected with the

25:39.544 --> 25:50.496
university in some way. Professors are workers. 
Were there...

25:54.623 --> 26:22.453
such days as was it hard at times to to get things to 
the city itself to buy such as gasoline or meats I

25:54.623 --> 26:22.453
guess meats and agriculture it wouldn't be that 
big a thing since that took place here but just

25:54.623 --> 26:22.453
during the war we had

25:54.623 --> 26:22.453
trouble getting things we used the system of 
neighbors going in together to

26:24.222 --> 26:33.575
do our transportation during the war. But after 
the war, we have had no coverage of anything. Can

26:35.077 --> 26:52.542
you think of any influential families, names that 
stand out of individual families of the area that

26:35.077 --> 26:52.542
have owned quite a bit or more or less, you know, 
influence the community to a big extent or would

26:53.095 --> 27:01.226
you say it's mostly been just a community working 
together? It seems to me it's more just a community

27:01.987 --> 27:06.713
working together. Mr. Burgess and a few people 
like that have developed places. Now, Mr. Burgess

27:13.502 --> 27:19.710
developed this section of the community and he 
also developed the what was called North Oakwood.

27:21.994 --> 27:26.401
This was South Oakwood, and that was North 
Oakwood. Then there was a group that developed the

27:26.421 --> 27:31.488
section to the west of this. But it has, there 
hasn't been any, just real leader in developing

27:32.810 --> 27:43.566
things and growing,

27:32.810 --> 27:43.566
building things. Just various

27:43.586 --> 27:48.233
individuals. Oh. Were the

27:51.095 --> 28:06.578
families that lived here then that were mostly 
faculty of the A&M school, since they had a lot in

27:51.095 --> 28:06.578
common, was it a closer knit community than it is 
now, do you think? Yes. I attribute part of that,

28:08.721 --> 28:15.431
though, to the fact that people have TVs and air 
conditioning. That makes a difference. I know

28:19.208 --> 28:21.472
that we used to have book clubs here. We'd have 
maybe people on two or three streets would each buy

28:23.715 --> 28:29.825
a book, and then we'd pass those on. So maybe we read 
a little more at that time. So you were saying that

28:34.894 --> 28:42.065
the TV made a big difference in social life here, 
but just everywhere too. Oh yes, everywhere. It's

28:43.548 --> 28:45.030
not just community. Did y'all used to listen to the 
radio as the main media? Yes, we did. We had a radio

28:52.362 --> 29:03.537
from... We bought it right after

28:52.362 --> 29:03.537
we married. It was the center of a lot of our 
entertainment, you might say. You had mentioned

29:05.559 --> 29:12.148
that your relatives were the ones that persuaded 
you to come here to this area at first. Why were they

29:12.601 --> 29:15.285
in this area, do you know? Well, I mentioned that 
that was Mrs. Coker who called me on the phone. Her

29:22.295 --> 29:27.242
father had moved here to set up that Allen Academy, 
the school. And then I had a cousin in Bryant whose

29:28.384 --> 29:36.255
husband was a doctor. I had another cousin whose 
husband was a druggist. I had an uncle who was a

29:39.881 --> 29:41.443
banker. And these people just entertained me when 
I came to visit before that, and then they

29:42.470 --> 29:56.730
suggested that I come down here and teach school. 
Do you know where your family is from as far as

29:56.750 --> 30:01.697
before they came to Texas? My mother's people came 
from Tennessee, and my father's people came from

30:02.638 --> 30:08.106
Mississippi.

30:14.414 --> 30:29.633
My husband's people were English,

30:14.414 --> 30:29.633
Scotch-Irish is what he said. My people were, my 
mother's people were, some of them from Italy and

30:29.653 --> 30:35.140
some from

30:40.739 --> 30:42.801
Well, I don't know. What other country? And my 
father's people were Swedish. Would you say that

30:51.109 --> 30:58.676
any particular nationality grouped together 
anywhere around this area? Like, you know, in

30:58.696 --> 31:04.902
central Texas it's Polish and Czech peoples, and 
then down towards San Antonio it's Germans. Would

31:05.443 --> 31:07.945
you say this area was more or less mixed as far as 
nationalities? Yes, there is a big Italian group

31:11.228 --> 31:19.610
here, and also there is a big Czech group. I know a 
man whose mother, to this day, doesn't speak

31:19.630 --> 31:23.781
English. She still speaks Czech.
