Well, usually the terrorism is aimed at the 
company first. The larger the company, the

00:13.555 --> 00:19.964
greater visibility it's going to get as far as the 
worldwide opinion is concerned, and that's

00:13.555 --> 00:19.964
usually what the terrorists are looking for. A 
subsidiary advantage that they're looking for,

00:21.146 --> 00:28.317
of course, is the effect of whatever attack 
they're making on the company, on the local

00:21.146 --> 00:28.317
political situation, but Very rarely is a 
terrorism directed at an individual unless he's

00:28.702 --> 00:40.194
of such a level or has been so influential in local 
politics, particularly, that they want him out of

00:28.702 --> 00:40.194
the way. And normally, an executive of a 
multinational company does not achieve that

00:40.214 --> 00:49.123
level of local prominence. So that the attacks are 
not directed against people personally,

00:49.143 --> 00:53.808
generally. They're just intended to get the 
maximum effect of world opinion. I heard a plant of

01:00.292 --> 01:03.276
yours was burnt down. What was that? Well, that was 
June 19th, 1969. Governor Rockefeller was

01:07.642 --> 01:24.144
planning a trip through Latin America, and the day 
before he was scheduled to retire, the terrorists

01:07.642 --> 01:24.144
at 1 o'clock in the morning, this was the Tupomaro 
terrorists in Uruguay, burned the

01:07.642 --> 01:24.144
administration building and attempted to burn 
our entire plant in Uruguay. A very small

01:24.164 --> 01:25.405
operation. We only had 350 employees, but it was 
one of the biggest in the country at the time. And

01:30.380 --> 01:33.865
for world effect, it was very effective on their 
part. It was the first time that an American

01:33.885 --> 01:38.531
installation had been subjected to this kind of 
international terrorism. And they certainly got

01:39.492 --> 01:44.039
quite a bit of press coverage as a result of it. 
Funny part about it is that the effect on the local

01:44.059 --> 01:50.788
people in Uruguay was exactly contrary to what the 
terrorists had expected. There was a tremendous

01:50.968 --> 01:56.796
howl of outrage at every level, from government to 
employees. As a matter of fact, the employees were

01:58.848 --> 02:04.774
very upset when we tried to pay overtime for their 
work in rebuilding the facilities. They wanted to

02:04.834 --> 02:06.175
donate their time. It was a very, very flattering 
and comforting thing to see that kind of reaction

02:07.537 --> 02:18.668
of the Uruguayans themselves to an attack that was 
calculated to drive them exactly in the other

02:07.537 --> 02:18.668
direction. It's nice to see. It sure is. Well, 
thank you very much. Thank you, Ms. Katz.

04:46.957 --> 05:11.277
Thank

04:46.957 --> 05:11.277
you.

05:58.456 --> 06:05.918
you

06:42.938 --> 07:07.691
.

07:07.711 --> 07:07.731
.

24:36.695 --> 24:38.841
Thank you.

31:50.416 --> 31:52.461
Thank you.

36:11.978 --> 36:13.130
Thank you.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.896
Amen.

39:57.428 --> 40:01.380
Thank

39:57.428 --> 40:01.380
you.

40:42.670 --> 40:44.158
Thank you.
