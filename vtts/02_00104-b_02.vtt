WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:06.710
When you first tried your boots on, did they fit? At 
that time, there were two, really just two

00:09.134 --> 00:12.359
bootmakers. There was Hollick and Lucchese out of 
San Antonio.

00:18.809 --> 00:25.699
I don't know, other than the fact that Hollick 
would keep them shined all year and we bought them

00:18.809 --> 00:25.699
from him, I'm sure they were about the same price. 
But Lucchese was really the only other maker. But

00:31.300 --> 00:34.866
that's keeping them shining all year was a pretty 
good thing. About how often when you were a

00:36.168 --> 00:42.479
student, about your senior year, about how often 
did you wear your boots? Mainly just on drill days.

00:46.045 --> 00:53.117
We only drilled once a week or parades. Now did you 
go to summer camp? I sure did. Where'd you go to?

00:57.803 --> 00:59.705
Fort Crockett, down in Galveston. Describe that 
summer camp experience. Tell me as much as you can

01:04.391 --> 01:06.433
remember about it. Well, there's one part of it 
I'll never forget. When I was going to school, I had

01:10.879 --> 01:19.210
acne on the back of my neck real bad, and a lot of 
times I'd have to have those things lanced. It was

01:19.270 --> 01:21.793
just like a rising.

01:23.107 --> 01:28.354
Part of the time I was in A&M I got an excuse not to 
wear a tie because I couldn't button my collar. But

01:30.457 --> 01:39.429
anyhow, one morning I decided I needed to go to sick 
call to get my one of those things lanced. I went

01:39.450 --> 01:44.517
over on sick call and the old colonel looked at me 
and said, put him in the hospital. The way they got

01:46.659 --> 01:51.426
their money was the number of patients they had in 
the hospital. Haskell, I was in that thing three

01:52.891 --> 01:56.176
damn days. Never did open that thing. And I carried 
meals to the patients. I shined the doorknobs. I

02:05.369 --> 02:07.132
cleaned the restrooms. Did everything in the 
world. And I thought, why in the world am I in this

02:09.295 --> 02:11.658
place? And the first night they put me in there, it 
was about full, and they put me in the prison ward.

02:18.488 --> 02:22.594
And in the middle of the night, they brought a 
prisoner in there who was drunk. And they put him in

02:23.384 --> 02:25.396
there and closed the door. And we didn't have air 
conditioning, and the mosquitoes were terrible.

02:31.282 --> 02:36.908
And I lay there with those mosquitoes sailing at me 
and wondering, now why am I in this darn place? Now

02:37.408 --> 02:40.632
that's one of the things I remember about summer 
camp. What did they, what did they, how did they

02:40.652 --> 02:44.355
train you all? Oh, we had rifle practice. We had, 
they had some big 12-inch guns there at that time on

02:47.459 --> 02:53.144
the seawall. And the fort, is that one located near 
the middle of the seawall? Yeah, there's a big

02:56.965 --> 03:03.317
restaurant there now and the embankments are 
still there where the guns were. There was two big

03:03.978 --> 03:13.575
12-inch guns and living quarters underneath for 
all the gun crews and ammunition and all that.

03:14.497 --> 03:16.240
About how many People were stationed there full 
time? Oh, I wouldn't have any idea. But a hundred

03:22.107 --> 03:23.250
or? Oh, I expect there may have been more than that 
because there was a complement for those big guns.

03:27.999 --> 03:28.900
But not a thousand? Oh, I don't imagine. There was 
about, as I remember, about two three-story

03:30.864 --> 03:37.377
dormitories and that's where they lived. And how 
many of y'all were there for the summer? Well, it

03:41.077 --> 03:45.184
was all the senior Coast Artillery people. 
Nationwide? No, no. Oh. A&M. A&M. I don't think

03:48.569 --> 03:50.913
there was any other schools there but us. I expect 
there was 150 of us, I imagine. And you were there

03:55.901 --> 03:56.803
for? Six weeks. Six weeks. Six weeks. What did you 
and your buddies do for a good time in Galveston?

04:03.605 --> 04:10.093
Well, one thing, we'd walk around in the red light 
district at night and listen to the gals hollering

04:03.605 --> 04:10.093
at you. On Post Office Street. Uh-huh. And, oh,

04:12.996 --> 04:20.646
they had some of the best seafood eating places on 
the seawall. You could get a shrimp cocktail that

04:22.748 --> 04:28.215
big for 25 cents. You're saying as big as a big salad 
plate. That's right. Were there gambling places

04:33.187 --> 04:37.254
in Galveston then?

04:40.459 --> 04:41.381
Later there was. I don't think it must have been 
later. I'm not sure it was at that time. Of course,

04:45.367 --> 04:50.716
I'm sure I know everyone out there. I don't know 
whether I know where they were, but it wasn't long

04:50.776 --> 04:54.823
after that. Now did you and your buddies put on your 
bathing suits and go over and enjoy the beach? Oh

04:58.731 --> 04:59.973
yeah, all the time. And one Sunday morning, Askel, 
there was not one wave out there. And you don't see

05:09.184 --> 05:10.746
that very often. There wasn't an ounce of breeze, 
and that thing was just as flat as this floor. You

05:16.973 --> 05:18.735
ever see a lot of water like that? I never seen it 
before or after. And hot, it wasn't any fun being

05:22.433 --> 05:25.297
out there. Of course, the fun of the waves, you 
know.

05:30.663 --> 05:38.192
When you were at summer camp, how well prepared had 
A&M made you for active duty? Did you feel fairly

05:39.674 --> 05:41.296
well prepared? Well, I think we did. We only had one 
more year, you know. The things we studied, as I've

05:47.977 --> 06:06.097
said before, we studied gunnery, studied small 
rifles,

05:47.977 --> 06:06.097
several of the bigger pieces of artillery, the 
six-inch guns, 75 millimeters. They showed us how

06:07.238 --> 06:12.284
you take them apart and how you clean them and how 
they're fired. We never fired any of the bigger

06:13.585 --> 06:17.950
guns, but we did fire the rifles. Did they talk to 
y'all that summer about what y'all might be doing

06:18.689 --> 06:27.601
if you were called to active duty? Not really. One 
interesting thing about it, when I was called to

06:30.846 --> 06:36.934
active duty, that's right where we went back to is 
Fort Crockett. They were building an army camp out

06:37.268 --> 06:46.078
of Galveston called Fort Crockett, I mean Fort, 
Camp Wallace. Camp Wallace, uh-huh. It was 10, 15

06:49.743 --> 06:56.891
miles up Highway 6 from Galveston, but it wasn't 
ready. So our unit, and there was about 3,000,

07:02.463 --> 07:12.915
ultimately in our unit, but they took all the 
officers and we went down to Fort Crockett and some

07:02.463 --> 07:12.915
of the regular army officers called themselves 
orient and that's for active duty. That was a

07:13.856 --> 07:16.079
couple of months. Now meanwhile, academically, 
you're making progress. As you look back, what

07:21.224 --> 07:29.674
were the key courses you took at A&M, the ones that 
were most important to you in your professional

07:21.224 --> 07:29.674
life? Are you talking about my My civilian life or 
Army life? No, your civilian. The summer

07:36.967 --> 07:38.629
surveying was one of them. Is that right? Six weeks 
of summer surveying. And you know civil engineers

07:41.712 --> 07:46.537
don't take any surveying anymore, I understand. 
Another one that was very interesting was what

07:47.538 --> 07:53.084
they call structures. We had a structure there. I 
can almost call his name, and he was super. He had

08:02.756 --> 08:08.532
the best notes that you ever did see of, you know, 
like railroad bridges and trusses. this sort of

08:08.849 --> 08:29.778
thing and that was a real interesting course that 
to figure if you take one of these big railroad

08:08.849 --> 08:29.778
trusses as to what stresses in this beam and what 
stresses in this and this and all and he could cut

08:08.849 --> 08:29.778
one of those things and tell you exactly whether 
it's tension or compression or you know that was

08:08.849 --> 08:29.778
that was interesting. And you never did think 
about changing your major? No. Got stronger and

08:35.562 --> 08:37.184
stronger. That's right. And when you were an 
undergraduate, what were you hoping you were

08:38.406 --> 08:42.492
going to get to do? Go to the highway department. 
That's what I really wanted to do. And when I got

08:46.938 --> 08:57.813
out, the highway department had a blanket offer to 
take all civil engineers that graduated from A&M.

08:57.833 --> 08:58.894
A good many of us did. Who are some of the teachers 
that you now realize were most important to you?

09:07.118 --> 09:15.051
Well, this fellow Sandstead, Mac New, Joe Orr. Joe 
Orr was, he was the survey man. That was his baby.

09:23.004 --> 09:33.261
And then we had a number of courses in, I don't know 
what to call it, but I guess you could call it

09:23.004 --> 09:33.261
administration. you know, as if you were going to 
be in administrative offices, you know, how to

09:33.680 --> 09:46.855
handle people and how to get along with compadres 
and how to get along with the public and this sort of

09:33.680 --> 09:46.855
thing. I think that was very beneficial. Did any 
faculty member ever give you any personal advice

09:50.600 --> 09:57.728
that you later realized was very important? What 
to do or not to do? I think they probably were if I

10:02.789 --> 10:09.015
could come up with some of them. I

10:09.435 --> 10:18.524
think Joe Orr was one of the ones that sort of aimed 
us toward the Highway Department. Joe was a

10:19.585 --> 10:26.051
student of the Highway Department because of the 
surveying.

10:30.055 --> 10:30.315
Mm-hm.

10:33.164 --> 10:53.853
Let's see, talking about linking things 
together,

10:33.164 --> 10:53.853
as you look at your professional life after 
leaving A&M, what did you learn at A&M that was very

10:33.164 --> 10:53.853
important to you in your professional life? What 
did you get from A&M that turned out to be

10:55.956 --> 11:00.342
significant, important? Well, one thing is, 
getting along with a fellow man.

11:07.227 --> 11:12.372
Aggies were noted for being buddies and getting 
along with each other. Of course, a lot of it was

11:12.392 --> 11:21.201
forced on them, but I think that was one of the 
things. Let me...

11:23.082 --> 11:27.847
One specific thing. This unit that I was called 
active duty with, was very unusual. The enlisted

11:37.188 --> 11:46.195
and non-commissioned people were black and the 
officers were white. And there were 100 officers

11:47.657 --> 11:56.024
called in that unit and 65 of them were A&M 
graduates.

11:58.486 --> 12:00.868
And we had a better record. We had better overall 
discipline. A lot of that type of units had worlds

12:06.711 --> 12:11.355
of trouble, worlds of trouble. And we had better 
discipline. We had less troubles. I think our

12:19.002 --> 12:27.890
relationship officer to enlisted men was much 
better because so many of us were used to these

12:19.002 --> 12:27.890
people. We were used to dealing with them. And we 
were those Four years. Four years. Now, where did

12:36.100 --> 12:38.843
you serve during WWII? Well, in the States, four 
years. After we were activated and got together

12:41.647 --> 12:52.302
down at Camp Wallace, we were moved to Camp Davis, 
North Carolina, right outside of Wilmington. You

12:53.583 --> 12:54.284
got it done? Uh-huh. She had a little skin tear on 
her left arm. We're talking about A&M

12:57.867 --> 13:05.194
and how well you were prepared. How well did it 
prepare you to be a highway engineer?

13:11.859 --> 13:18.105
Well,

13:11.859 --> 13:18.105
that's really hard to say.

13:21.448 --> 13:26.052
People who wanted to work for the highway 
department started right on the low end of the

13:21.448 --> 13:26.052
totem pole. I was on the back end of a measuring 
chain, driving stakes and whatever. I think, here

13:33.547 --> 13:47.607
again, it just prepared me to get educated and take 
advantage of people who were willing to share with

13:33.547 --> 13:47.607
me. But when you began as a highway engineer, Was 
the preparation you had had at A&M up to date? Oh,

13:59.481 --> 14:01.744
yeah, sure.

14:03.506 --> 14:08.451
The main thing I used right off was the surveying 
that Joe Orr had emphasized. And then from there

14:09.492 --> 14:20.845
on, then I began to get assignments where I had some 
supervisor responsibilities and a few design

14:09.492 --> 14:20.845
responsibilities. Now, what other schools had 
high-quality highway programs then? Was A&M

14:27.364 --> 14:28.685
clearly the best? Well, it got most of the 
students, as I'm told.

14:40.257 --> 14:49.887
Well, probably Texas got about as many as A&M did, 
but according to the highway department, A&M The

14:50.356 --> 14:58.471
Texas civil engineers were the ones they 
preferred, or at least it seemed to be that's where

14:50.356 --> 14:58.471
they had the most of them from. But it's really hard 
to say. You know, you look back and you wonder,

15:03.981 --> 15:07.367
where did I learn so-and-so? Or, you know, 
something comes along. In fact, I heard one of my

15:09.811 --> 15:13.478
instructors one time said, one of these days 
you'll make some kind of a decision and you'll

15:14.690 --> 15:20.476
think, now where did I learn to do that? And I guess 
that's right. You wonder, where was it that you

15:23.018 --> 15:30.986
learned what caused you to make this sort of a 
thing? And I guess it's the overall education that

15:31.066 --> 15:34.610
does it. Also, am I correct that had you not gone to 
A&M, there's no other college you could have

15:35.531 --> 15:42.978
afforded to gone to? That's correct. I wanted to 
either.

15:49.578 --> 15:54.585
Of course, I wanted the military part of it. That 
was another one of my desires. I've always enjoyed

15:59.071 --> 16:04.438
the military, Haskell. And N.M. prepared that 
well, didn't he? He did. He did. And you know, I even

16:10.883 --> 16:13.786
followed it after the war. I stayed active. I 
stayed active in the military. And you retired

16:17.230 --> 16:18.812
what rank? Brigadier General. Brigadier 
General. And as you saw all of the other ROTC

16:22.376 --> 16:34.370
products, how well did A&M's officers compare 
with the other ROTC officers? I don't think they

16:34.490 --> 16:36.132
could hold light to them. There sure was a world of 
people that wanted A&M graduates.

16:46.032 --> 16:53.467
As you look back on A&M, what are the reasons why 
Aggies have so much pride? Why are Aggies proud of

16:54.369 --> 16:56.774
having gone to school here? That's a good 
question.

17:04.664 --> 17:08.752
I guess the easiest way to answer that is just the 
reputation that A&M has got.

17:12.400 --> 17:17.250
And of course the students are what make the 
reputation, I guess. Are there some things that

17:17.270 --> 17:23.382
pull people together to help create that 
reputation?

17:26.753 --> 17:31.638
Well, the Corps is one of the things that pulled a 
lot of people together. And of course, in my day,

17:31.879 --> 17:34.582
you had to be in the Corps. So you all felt somewhat 
of the same feelings and interest in each other.

17:47.836 --> 17:51.580
And are there symbols of that pulling together?

17:56.892 --> 17:59.574
Yeah, sure. I guess that's the big thing. Ring? 
Yeah. And boots? Boots and ring. Silver tabs?

18:08.903 --> 18:10.044
Yeah. Football games? Yeah. I guess the one thing 
is the ring. Like I told you, it's recognized

18:18.151 --> 18:25.498
outside of A&M.

18:25.951 --> 18:28.234
When you are no more, what's going to happen to your 
ring? To whom does it go? To A&M, to the former

18:30.418 --> 18:33.622
students. Okay. Have you ever seen that 
collection? Oh, yes. That's marvelous.

18:37.708 --> 18:38.530
Fantastic. Nothing like that anywhere else that I 
know of. In the world. Right. And your senior

18:43.557 --> 18:45.841
boots, you still have them. I have a country place 
out over in Burleson County, and they're hanging

18:46.622 --> 18:53.612
up in the building. Did you get a saber when you were 
seen? Where is it? I let a friend of mine have it.

19:02.938 --> 19:09.245
Actually it was back at the time, you remember when 
they couldn't get sabers? Did you know there was a

19:09.345 --> 19:17.275
time when they, and I let him have the saber. As you 
were getting ready for your commencement in the

19:17.395 --> 19:23.802
spring of 1940, you went through final review and 
all that. Who came to, what loved ones, what

19:28.481 --> 19:32.305
family? Well, my ultimate wife, my mother and 
father, her mother and father, my brothers and

19:33.886 --> 19:44.477
sisters, the whole family was there. They thought 
that was pretty special. I was the first one of any

19:47.761 --> 19:53.086
of my family that graduated from A&M. There's been 
a bunch of them since. Right, and were lots of your

19:55.203 --> 20:02.529
classmates first generation college students? 
Were there lots of your buddies just like you where

20:02.549 --> 20:06.753
mom and dad hadn't gone to college? I really don't 
know, Haskell. I wouldn't, I expect there were,

20:09.736 --> 20:15.201
but I just don't know, don't know about that. And do 
you remember anything about commencement? Was it

20:21.646 --> 20:23.488
held at Guyon Hall? Mm-hmm. And was everybody 
there? Oh, it was full. And was your name called?

20:30.998 --> 20:32.079
Did you ever see the old guy in the hall? Oh, yes. Was 
your name called and your hand shaken? Mm-hmm. I

20:37.467 --> 20:43.435
guess by President Walton, by Walton I'm sure, 
because I think he was still there at that time. And

20:44.393 --> 20:50.766
then the commandant that issued me my commission. 
It was a special day. As soon as you graduated, did

20:54.735 --> 20:59.344
you have orders to report for active duty? No. 
Didn't have that until nine months later. I had my

21:02.945 --> 21:07.870
offer for the Texas Highway Department. And how 
much was that offer? $125. A month? A month. What

21:13.016 --> 21:14.457
did you think about that salary? Well, it was the 
most I'd ever had. And where was you? Hearn. In

21:19.843 --> 21:20.203
Hearn? Hearn. So you could still live at home? No, I 
actually lived in Hearn. I boarded there until

21:25.809 --> 21:29.993
Lucille and I were married, and then we lived in 
Hearn. And when did you get married? August, after

21:33.673 --> 21:35.814
I got out in June. Of 1940. August 10th. And you 
rented a place in Hearn. How much did it cost? Well,

21:42.761 --> 21:49.587
she and I, you mean when we married, $30 a month. It 
was a bedroom and a, I guess we shared the bathroom

21:49.607 --> 21:54.651
probably. And a little kitchen. And what were your 
duties? at the highway department, I was put in a

22:00.719 --> 22:12.180
field party, staking out center lines and running 
drainage areas and setting slope stakes and this

22:00.719 --> 22:12.180
sort of thing. And as I said, I was on the other end of 
the chain, and the old boy that was on the front end

22:12.200 --> 22:22.018
of it was about six feet two inches tall and had legs 
about yea long. And we'd go across a plowed field,

22:22.893 --> 22:30.344
and he could step from one top to the other top, and 
I'd have to step on top, bottom, top. He liked to run

22:31.005 --> 22:32.347
me to death. Now, for what highway were you all 
surveying? Well, the first job I went out on, they

22:38.456 --> 22:49.693
had just done the paving from north of Calvert to 
Bremond, and we were doing the final estimates on

22:38.456 --> 22:49.693
it. Then the next thing was a little spur up near 
Buffalo, went off into, away from the highway. And

23:00.319 --> 23:05.505
then it wasn't long after that until we were 
building one north out of Fairfield. And then, of

23:07.307 --> 23:14.134
course, we ultimately, Highway 6 and 290.

23:16.617 --> 23:20.001
We had several counties that we worked out of. And 
so you felt good about that job? I did. I was proud of

23:24.481 --> 23:26.284
it. Worked like hell, I tell you. All right, we're 
getting ready to kind of summarize this now. Based

23:35.738 --> 23:49.920
on your experience of all sorts, if you were a 
consultant to A&M today, to the leadership out

23:35.738 --> 23:49.920
there, what advice would you give them about the 
future of A&M? What would you advise them to do or

23:50.575 --> 23:52.778
not to do?

24:02.709 --> 24:20.110
Well,

24:02.709 --> 24:20.110
I think a lot of emphasis needs to be put on

24:02.709 --> 24:20.110
people being able to work together.

24:23.414 --> 24:35.548
ability to supervise and not

24:23.414 --> 24:35.548
drive people, but

24:23.414 --> 24:35.548
give them incentives.

24:39.552 --> 24:43.176
You know, the technical things now are all hard. 
Like I told you a while ago, they don't teach

24:43.457 --> 24:46.260
surveying anymore.

24:48.983 --> 24:51.666
People learn to survey and that's all farmed out 
now. Engineers don't do survey work anymore.

25:03.350 --> 25:14.127
Probably to give a lot of emphasis to, I don't

25:03.350 --> 25:14.127
know what I want to say really.

25:19.861 --> 25:23.726
Given good leadership, I guess is what I'm trying 
to say. Leadership, I think, is a real important

25:23.786 --> 25:27.851
thing. I've worked in and around a few people that 
didn't know how to supervise. And there could be a

25:33.859 --> 25:46.054
lot of emphasis in the A&M structure on

25:33.859 --> 25:46.054
administrative duties and responsibilities. 
Okay. If you could make a major gift to A&M,

25:47.579 --> 25:58.594
somebody hands you a check for a million dollars, 
but you've got to pass that check on, but you can

25:47.579 --> 25:58.594
decide what they do with it. What would your gift, 
what would you want it to be for?

26:09.149 --> 26:12.093
It would be hard to say. What would be your favorite 
efforts, projects at A&M?

26:23.210 --> 26:41.219
Well, I guess

26:23.210 --> 26:41.219
opportunities for disadvantaged students and 
students who were not able to pay for good

26:23.210 --> 26:41.219
education. And by disadvantage, you're talking 
about economics. Yeah, right. Would it matter

26:45.225 --> 26:46.647
what they majored in? No, I don't think so. How 
would you judge their capability? You mean the

26:52.336 --> 26:54.219
individual's capability? What they could have 
come. How do you pick this one instead of that one?

26:59.348 --> 27:05.739
Well, a lot of it I'd have to look back on their high 
school education and their high school

26:59.348 --> 27:05.739
administrators. I think that would be a key 
figure. You know, you got to sort of see how they

27:09.325 --> 27:15.996
came up and whether they would take advantage of 
what you could offer them or not. And I don't really

27:16.697 --> 27:18.360
know how you do that. to the best advantage, but... 
Would it matter what the student was going to major

27:18.830 --> 27:24.776
in? No. Because, you know, the world needs all 
vocations. All right. To what, as you look back, to

27:32.064 --> 27:45.158
what people associated with Texas A&M, faculty, 
students, administrators, do you feel most

27:32.064 --> 27:45.158
grateful?

27:46.268 --> 27:53.454
A couple of them are Mr. Hensel and Mr. Horsley for 
providing me the opportunity to help myself. And

27:55.556 --> 28:03.684
then there was a few of the instructors that

27:55.556 --> 28:03.684
had lots to do with it. And then, not from A&M, but 
from my parents making it available to me. A lot of

28:12.852 --> 28:15.094
parents don't even, don't do that. But those two 
people really made it possible for me to go to

28:17.441 --> 28:24.871
school with A&M. What have we left out? I've only 
got one more question, unless you can think of some

28:29.257 --> 28:33.923
things we've left out. What have we not covered? Do 
you remember any goofy moments? Any sad moments?

28:45.078 --> 28:52.867
I

28:45.078 --> 28:52.867
remember one thing, and I didn't know whether I was 
going to tell you this or not.

28:56.251 --> 29:03.319
I found out that it doesn't pay to let some other 
student see your work.

29:04.501 --> 29:07.544
And this was in Cuball Rich's class. An old boy 
copied off my paper on an examination, and he

29:08.806 --> 29:13.431
busted both of us. But you didn't know he was 
copying? No. And he told us, you know, that two

29:18.902 --> 29:31.216
papers are too much alike, and he said if one will 
admit who did the copying, I'll give the other the

29:18.902 --> 29:31.216
grade, and he wouldn't do it. But that was one of the 
worst moments I ever got, and I decided right then

29:39.668 --> 29:48.800
You know, I really, I guess I didn't really care if 
somebody wanted to do it that way, but I found out

29:39.668 --> 29:48.800
that it didn't pay. I wanted to whip his butt, but I 
had to take it over that summer. And you didn't have

29:56.971 --> 30:03.339
any tragic, any real great sad moments? No, not 
really. What about, were you ever involved in any

30:06.702 --> 30:12.772
pranks or jokes or anything like that? No. Here, as 
I said, not leaving on the campus. I was away from

30:17.300 --> 30:21.607
most of that, you know, not being there at night. 
All right, then my last question is, what feelings

30:21.667 --> 30:28.559
do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M today? How 
do you feel about the place now? Well, of course, I

30:32.757 --> 30:37.902
still think it's the greatest place a person can 
get an education. And I've been, a lot of my buddies

30:39.423 --> 30:47.751
think letting girls go there is the worst thing 
that ever happened. And I'm not of that vocation. I

30:50.434 --> 30:52.756
think it's made the university. It's made the 
place. Right now, it'd be a little one-horse

30:56.900 --> 30:59.963
school if it wasn't. But that's one of the big 
things, in my opinion, and I give credit to Mr.

31:00.753 --> 31:05.723
Rutter. He and I were awful good friends. Describe 
examples of that friendship. Well, we worked

31:15.041 --> 31:17.125
together a whole lot, see.
