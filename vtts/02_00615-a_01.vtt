WEBVTT

00:01.347 --> 00:12.121
in with what interested in the set pattern of the 
interview, what interested you in oceanography,

00:01.347 --> 00:12.121
and what brought you to this sort of newly emerging 
discipline, in your case, particularly early.

00:14.044 --> 00:17.348
Yeah, wish you hadn't said that.

00:19.812 --> 00:22.295
Mm-hmm.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.642
Well.

00:33.055 --> 00:44.370
When I was in graduate school in 1939, I entered 
graduate school at the University of Buffalo. And

00:46.392 --> 00:50.197
I got interested in limnology, which is the 
oceanography of lakes. It's oceanography

00:51.178 --> 00:53.381
without salt. And the man with whom I worked, Dr. 
Tressler, T-R-E-S-S-L-E-R, Dr. Willis

00:55.243 --> 01:01.932
Tressler, worked with me on a number of the lakes in 
New York State and a bay near Rochester called

01:03.987 --> 01:17.960
Irondequoit Bay. I give you this as a background 
only because in the New York State lakes we had a

01:18.300 --> 01:32.914
diversity of environmental conditions from 
deep, deep lakes that were high in oxygen to lakes

01:33.788 --> 01:38.352
that had very little oxygen because of all the 
organic material. And then on Irondequoit Bay, we

01:38.452 --> 01:48.061
planned a year's study going there every month in 
order to see what happened. So when I got my

01:49.642 --> 01:58.991
master's there, I decided to go on to work on the 
doctorate. And as is so often the case, you decide

01:59.111 --> 02:03.795
with whom you want to work. rather than 
specifically where to go. And I wanted to work with

02:07.047 --> 02:17.062
George Evelyn Hutchinson, who probably was and is 
the greatest of the limnologists, the freshwater

02:07.047 --> 02:17.062
ecologists. So while I was with the University of 
Buffalo, I worked for a New York State fishing game

02:17.082 --> 02:23.692
to get through school. And when I went to Yale to 
work with Evelyn, I worked with the Connecticut

02:23.752 --> 02:30.542
State fishing game. Now, while I was working on my 
degree at Yale, I worked with Dr. Gordon Riley, who

02:31.949 --> 02:54.285
now is probably one of the leading men in the world 
on the food chain in the sea, starting with the

02:31.949 --> 02:54.285
sun's energy to work on up through the energy 
considerations to the Clamax predators, the

02:55.615 --> 03:02.223
Tunas, for instance. Anyway,

03:02.243 --> 03:21.808
while I was at Yale, the war came along, and I left to 
teach in a little school where I did my

03:02.243 --> 03:21.808
undergraduate work in Pennsylvania in a naval 
marine radar school. And I got hopelessly bored

03:23.122 --> 03:26.706
after about a year, a year and a half. So I wrote to 
Dr. Riley and asked if there was any chance of

03:27.026 --> 03:36.555
working with him, because I came to respect him so 
much at Yale. At that time, he was at the Woods Hole

03:37.496 --> 03:42.441
Oceanographic Institution. Now, in 1941, I had 
worked with him on one cruise of the Atlantis out on

03:42.461 --> 03:52.251
Georges and Grand Banks. She's a beautiful ship, 
as you probably know. I have a picture of her over

03:57.085 --> 03:59.148
there. Mostly at the time we were under full sail, I 
worked as his chemist, so he knew me. And he knew

04:10.645 --> 04:20.500
that I got terribly seasick and did things like 
going up to the top of the 140-foot main mast and

04:21.492 --> 04:25.477
freezing there, so they had to come up and get me 
down and so forth. Anyway, he said, sure, come to

04:25.497 --> 04:29.301
the Woods Hole Oceanographic. So I went with the 
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1942 or

04:30.422 --> 04:45.660
43

04:30.422 --> 04:45.660
and got involved in work on the physics of 
underwater sounds. When you transmit a sonic

04:47.446 --> 05:09.851
pulse into the ocean because of the vertical 
changes in the temperature and to a much lesser

04:47.446 --> 05:09.851
degree because of vertical changes in the 
salinity, the sound is refracted.

05:09.871 --> 05:11.513
And if the target is a submarine, Under some 
conditions, it can go practically under the ship,

05:12.927 --> 05:17.992
and you don't even know it's there. So I had spent 
eight long years in college, studiously avoiding

05:19.633 --> 05:25.418
anything in physics. Became a biologist and 
aquatic biologist. Went with the Woods Hole

05:32.265 --> 05:42.394
Oceanographic Institution, working with Dr. 
Riley Allen Vine, Columbus Islin, Fritz

05:43.606 --> 05:49.838
Fuglester, Dean Pompous, Maurice Ewing, the 
whole school of oceanography. And under contract

05:51.100 --> 06:03.964
with Woods Hole, went to Miami to work on the 
physics of underwater sound. Because at that

06:04.004 --> 06:06.829
time, we were losing ships. I could sit in my hotel 
room in Miami and see the tankers going up as they

06:07.298 --> 06:19.741
were torpedoed.

06:19.761 --> 06:30.741
And then I came back to Woods Hole after spending 
time with Gordon and others on underwater sound.

06:31.818 --> 06:54.945
They got me interested in going down in the 
submarines to work on the compressibility of a

06:31.818 --> 06:54.945
submarine as you dived and the ballasting as a 
function of this thermocline, rapid change in the

06:31.818 --> 06:54.945
temperature and thus in the density. And we 
installed bathy thermographs on the submarines

07:00.134 --> 07:09.344
and then went out on the submarines to teach other 
diving officers how to use the records in

07:00.134 --> 07:09.344
adjusting the ballast and the trim.

07:12.127 --> 07:24.201
So I went back to Woods Hole in 1945, I think,

07:12.127 --> 07:24.201
45 or 46, I don't remember, to work on a report and 
summarizing what I had learned in oceanography

07:24.535 --> 07:43.579
and propagation of sound in seawater and 
operation of the submarines with Alfred

07:24.535 --> 07:43.579
Redfield, who at that time was the assistant 
director under Columbus Islin. And suddenly a man

07:45.621 --> 07:51.268
by the name of Dr. Cliff Barnes, who's now retired 
with the University of Washington and was one of

07:52.413 --> 08:02.488
the first men in the field of oceanography to have a 
degree in oceanography. Incidentally, he worked

08:02.528 --> 08:04.631
for the Coast Guard. And the commandant of the 
Coast Guard, Iceberg Eddie Smith, got the first

08:06.173 --> 08:16.428
PhD in oceanography ever given in our nation. That 
was at the University of Washington. Anyway.

08:24.863 --> 08:38.197
Cliff came to Woods Hole and asked if I would 
consider spending five weeks at Bikini, because

08:24.863 --> 08:38.197
they were thinking of having some atomic bomb 
tests. I'd just moved my wife and kids to Woods

08:38.217 --> 08:45.805
Hole, and we were going to settle down after all of 
this being away from the family. And I said, sure,

08:45.825 --> 08:48.488
I'd love to go. So for six months in lieu of five 
weeks, We worked on the oceanography, the flow

08:53.332 --> 09:08.826
patterns through and around the Bikini Atoll in 
preparation for both the air blast and the

08:53.332 --> 09:08.826
underwater blast. An interesting aspect is they 
had brought together probably every one of the

09:08.846 --> 09:17.733
major oceanographers in our nation. Our leader 
was Roger Rebell from Scripps, who's now with

09:22.542 --> 09:25.786
Harvard. Cliff Barnes. And Walter Monk was there, 
who's now the director of the big lab at Scripps.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.903
Bill Von Arks from Woods Hole. Oh hell, I can't even 
remember all of them. Hal Turner from Woods Hole.

09:51.736 --> 10:07.238
I doubt if... Marston Sargent, who is at Scripps,

09:51.736 --> 10:07.238
it's pretty hard to think of an oceanographer back 
in 1946 in our nation who was not at Bikini. Gene

10:07.258 --> 10:19.836
LaFond, who was with the Naval Electronics Lab and 
is now retired from the government and has a

10:07.258 --> 10:19.836
company of his own in...

10:20.930 --> 10:22.353
as a consultant in oceanography. And while I was at 
Bikini, I was offered a job with what was then the

10:23.656 --> 10:31.973
Navy Hydrographic Office. Dr. Richard Fleming, 
who was the senior oceanographer with Roger

10:31.993 --> 10:41.773
Rebell, he's one of the authors Fairdrip Johnson 
and Fleming was asked to head up the Division of

10:42.513 --> 10:51.743
Oceanography at the Navy Hydrographic Office. So 
I came back with Dr. Fleming, Dr. Barnes, Shirley

10:52.403 --> 11:11.203
Bates, who's now the chief scientist with the 
Coast Guard at the lab in Groton, Dr. John Lyman,

10:52.403 --> 11:11.203
who had a variety of jobs and now retired in North 
Carolina and myself were the nucleus of what

11:11.757 --> 11:20.147
became the Navy Oceanographic Office. We started 
with five people and ended up with over 2,000. And

11:26.095 --> 11:39.992
it was rather an exciting development because, of 
course, really the only person in that whole group

11:26.095 --> 11:39.992
who had a degree in oceanography was Dr. Fleming. 
In the early days, everybody we hired had a degree

11:42.064 --> 12:07.498
in some one of the natural sciences, physics, 
chemistry, biology, math, statistics, but there

11:42.064 --> 12:07.498
were no people really with degrees in 
oceanography because Scripps, which was about

11:42.064 --> 12:07.498
the only institution other than the University of 
Washington that had a curriculum in the marine

12:07.968 --> 12:29.172
sciences in oceanography, kept bringing people 
on board, looking towards getting a degree, and

12:07.968 --> 12:29.172
Scripps would say, hey, if you could give me two 
more years, we have a new contract with the Navy or

12:07.968 --> 12:29.172
NSF or whoever it happens to be. So John Lyman,

12:29.492 --> 12:36.220
who ended up with... Hydrographic Office with us 
and then Department of Interior and so forth.

12:43.819 --> 12:46.222
Pritchard, who ended up with Johns Hopkins. Dale 
Leeper, who ended up with Texas A&M and is now out at

12:47.003 --> 12:57.617
the Naval, what's it called, Naval School in the 
West Coast. Monterey. Monterey. Wayne Burt, who

13:03.227 --> 13:12.539
ended up as the director of Department of 
Oceanography at Oregon State, all were PhD

13:03.227 --> 13:12.539
candidates at Scripps. All got involved in 
contractual arrangements. All left Scripps to

13:16.764 --> 13:26.676
take jobs, then went back and got their degree 
because they could tell Scripps to drop dead on the

13:16.764 --> 13:26.676
contract route, you see, and get their degrees.

13:31.482 --> 13:37.054
I had several questions along the way I'd like to 
ask you about what we discussed thus far. What

13:38.638 --> 13:43.147
exactly did you do at the bikini test? I was one of 
the group that was concerned with the flow of water

13:49.505 --> 14:16.255
through the atoll was in an area in which the other 
trade winds piled the water up against the eastern

13:49.505 --> 14:16.255
edge of the atoll and that formed a hydrostatic 
head so that the water always flowed from east to

13:49.505 --> 14:16.255
west through the the basin of the atoll and the idea 
was after the the nuclear devices were exploded,

14:18.057 --> 14:27.990
how soon could the people go back into the lagoon 
with safety? So that meant that as long as the trade

14:29.933 --> 14:38.684
winds were blowing, the water was piled up, and you 
had a hydrostatic head, you had to flow through. I

14:40.327 --> 14:42.850
remember we couldn't figure out one area of the 
lagoon. So we flew back. Bill VanArks and I flew

14:47.092 --> 15:07.065
from Bikini to Kwajalein to the west coast to 
Washington to Woods Hole so he could look at the

14:47.092 --> 15:07.065
flow pattern by building a scaled-down model of 
the atoll in a flume at the Woods Hole

14:47.092 --> 15:07.065
Oceanographic And we found out what it was was 
horizontal eddies at the major pass into the

15:07.805 --> 15:14.451
lagoon. Anyway, the day before the air blast, the 
trade winds stopped blowing. The hydrostatic

15:25.402 --> 15:27.924
head thus decreased. The air blast went off. They 
brought the people back in on our prediction as a

15:30.587 --> 15:36.833
result of the flow pattern. The flow pattern, of 
course, had completely changed. They had to sink

15:41.226 --> 15:43.027
the damn ships. They had to throw away the men's 
clothes. It was a mess. It just shows you the

15:47.272 --> 15:53.558
vagaries of what we now call ocean-atmosphere 
accoupling and air-sea interaction. Even in

15:54.760 --> 16:02.668
those days, we knew something was going on, but we 
didn't realize like we do as of... the last two days

16:03.138 --> 16:29.955
I've been involved with a group and about all we 
have discussed is ocean atmosphere coupling and

16:03.138 --> 16:29.955
air-sea interaction and the global weather 
because we now realize that this is a factor that we

16:03.138 --> 16:29.955
have to understand or we never will be able to 
improve our understanding of global weather.

16:33.125 --> 16:39.674
Did there seem to be any conflicts at Bikini 
between military and civilian oceanographers?

16:40.114 --> 16:44.360
No, there were no really military 
oceanographers. All the people that were there in

16:44.500 --> 16:48.185
terms of oceanography were civilians. The only 
man in uniform, well, there were two. Well, there

16:55.274 --> 16:56.375
were three. Roger Revell was a commander. Marston 
Sargent was a commander. I spent a week with him on

17:03.905 --> 17:13.181
rongelap doing some work, and the only thing he 
wore the whole week was his commander's hat with

17:03.905 --> 17:13.181
the gold leaves. And there was a marine captain 
from a museum in Chicago interested in the birds

17:14.262 --> 17:23.618
out there, and the rest were civilians. The prime 
purpose of the military was to provide logistics,

17:24.104 --> 17:32.712
to provide small craft to get onto the reefs. Now, 
there were some arguments. Some of the elderly

17:37.257 --> 17:50.770
scientists at that time, I was quite young 
compared to now, of course, who felt that they

17:37.257 --> 17:50.770
weren't receiving the attention in terms of the 
priorities they'd ought to get. Well, the Roger

17:51.357 --> 18:01.812
Revell and Marston Sargent and Cliff Barnes and 
the cool heads in command, I'd say no. There was no

18:01.892 --> 18:05.136
overt conflict at all. Argument has conflict now.

18:10.944 --> 18:17.573
Did the aftermath of the test, except for the 
combination of title wins, come out about like you

18:10.944 --> 18:17.573
had expected it to? Well, of course we didn't 
expect, because we had... nothing to base

18:21.293 --> 18:23.615
expectations on. I went out again the next summer 
on a repeats survey, and I'll admit I was very

18:25.356 --> 18:43.211
surprised at the level of the radionuclides in the 
hole that the underwater blast blew in the bottom

18:25.356 --> 18:43.211
of the lagoon. Now that was ignorance on my part. 
There were those who knew so much more than I did

18:45.033 --> 18:51.098
about the half-life, and then I used Well, there 
was a man from AEC by the name of Seymour who was with

18:52.563 --> 19:19.701
the University of Washington, continued work for 
years on the biologically concentrated

18:52.563 --> 19:19.701
radionuclides before the people who had been 
moved to the island of Lingenai from Bikini were

18:52.563 --> 19:19.701
allowed to move back. level had reached a safe 
level. But the first thing, on the air blast we went

19:25.352 --> 19:43.697
off about six miles and stopped the ship and it was 
just at dawn, it was a beautiful morning and we had

19:25.352 --> 19:43.697
the radio on and we heard the bombardier say, bombs 
away. we had read in the newspapers that the blast

19:44.268 --> 19:52.446
was going to open up a hole in the ocean floor and all 
these other things. The bomb went off and it was one

19:52.466 --> 19:58.418
of the most fabulously beautiful things, 
awe-inspiring I've ever seen. The first sound I

19:59.681 --> 20:04.251
heard after the bomb went off was a young enlisted 
man in an absolutely odd voice say, geez, just like

20:04.957 --> 20:12.047
a pair of lady skivvies. It was the most beautiful 
colors in that morning sunrise you've ever seen.

20:18.255 --> 20:22.901
To him, that was about the most appropriate thing 
to compare this color to. It was probably the most,

20:23.702 --> 20:27.167
I don't momentous thing I would ever see or ever 
will see was that bomb going off at six miles away

20:27.468 --> 20:39.421
and the first thing I heard was a beautiful remark.

20:41.002 --> 20:44.827
Then after the bomb then you come to the 
oceanographic office. I assume it's Fleming then

20:44.847 --> 20:49.291
who makes the original contact with you? Yes, 
that's right. And had you known him prior to? No.

20:57.893 --> 21:03.079
I'm really not sure why he got in touch with me now 
that you ask that after all these years. I had

21:03.199 --> 21:13.051
accepted a National Research Council Fellowship 
to go back to school and do some more graduate work

21:03.199 --> 21:13.051
when the offer came from him. I was at Bikini when 
the offer came, and I had to make a decision whether

21:13.091 --> 21:25.285
to join the government or to go back to school. 
presented such a challenge to develop the first

21:26.125 --> 21:36.140
really major oceanographic activity in the 
federal government. And it was. It was the only, in

21:37.923 --> 21:39.686
fact. Office of Naval Research was under the Dr. 
Revell's leadership. He was the head, along with

21:49.501 --> 21:54.428
Mary

21:56.163 --> 22:15.927
editor of Deep Sea Research, worked at Woods Hole, 
works at Woods Hole Oceanic, Mary Sears,

21:56.163 --> 22:15.927
S-E-A-R-S, and she was a commander of the Navy, and 
she and Captain Revell at that time ran the

22:17.813 --> 22:25.701
oceanographic office in the Navy hydrographic 
office before Fleming took over. It was just an

22:28.123 --> 22:35.431
interesting challenge about the only. How did you 
perceive your job when you first arrived there?

22:38.434 --> 22:40.596
What sort of things did you want to do? This is 
before the famous tenure plan. Oh, gosh, yes. I

22:45.140 --> 22:45.541
don't know. I was so fresh out of school. The only 
job I'd ever really had was the job with the school I

22:49.201 --> 23:02.783
mentioned as instructor in the radar school, and 
then going directly with the Woods Hole

22:49.201 --> 23:02.783
Oceanographic. And I knew from my experiences on 
destroyers and submarines and that bikini that I

23:02.803 --> 23:16.845
had fallen completely in love with the ocean, that 
it was just to be my whole life. imagine a life not

23:17.028 --> 23:20.412
involved with the oceans. And so Dr. Fleming 
indicated that one of the plans for the new

23:20.432 --> 23:34.187
Division of Oceanography at the Hydrographic 
Office was to obtain some seagoing vessels. And so

23:35.148 --> 23:43.677
I saw an opportunity to have my cake and eat it, and 
to get back to sea, of course.

23:44.180 --> 23:47.104
Did you not, you first commissioned two vessels, 
is that correct? Well, after we formed the

23:47.144 --> 24:09.394
Division of Oceanography and we began working 
with the Navy, because it was the Navy

23:47.144 --> 24:09.394
Hydrographic Office at that time, we worked with 
Admiral Momsen and the Submarine Force, the

23:47.144 --> 24:09.394
editor of the Momsen Long, and Admiral Grenfell 
and some officers that I had known, and this is a

24:10.775 --> 24:16.363
marine force, during the war. And Dr. Byrnes 
prepared a chart to show for the North Atlantic,

24:17.585 --> 24:26.057
the areas that we simply had no oceanographic 
knowledge whatsoever. And most of them were in the

24:27.700 --> 24:35.531
North Atlantic in the winter, which I didn't quite 
realize this significance of. So we got two AVPs.

24:39.477 --> 24:40.478
These are the big ex-coast guard seaplane 
tenders. And Dr. Lyman and I designed the

24:46.091 --> 24:56.606
alterations to convert these two big ships into 
oceanographic research vessels.

24:59.310 --> 25:04.236
And that was the San Pablo and the Rehoboth. And we 
then spent Let's see, until 1951, I was at an

25:10.208 --> 25:20.867
International Union of Geology and Geophysics 
meeting in Europe. I had just come back from a

25:20.967 --> 25:25.696
cruise in the Arctic on the icebreaker Edisto. 
Fallen completely in love with the Arctic, now on

25:26.237 --> 25:31.807
top of enjoying going to sea. The Arctic was so 
fabulously beautiful. And I could see so many

25:35.791 --> 25:42.079
interesting problems on ice, icebergs and ice 
formation. Came home from that long cruise up

25:43.381 --> 25:54.136
around Yanmeyan and into what now would be 
considered as the Russian waters. Then went to

25:55.377 --> 25:59.723
Europe and came home and immediately got a polio. 
That kind of changed my plans. And while I was in

26:02.455 --> 26:19.277
Europe, I was offered a job at the Bureau of 
Commercial Fisheries Laboratory in Hawaii to

26:02.455 --> 26:19.277
work on the oceanography of the tropical Pacific 
and other distribution of the Tunas, pure

26:02.455 --> 26:19.277
descriptive oceanography. So while I was on the 
San Pablo and the Rehoboth, and having had some

26:19.317 --> 26:28.849
experience, which so few people had, I went on 
these cruises as a senior scientist. I mention

26:34.817 --> 26:49.101
that only that I was able to essentially plan the 
cruises to meet the needs of all of the areas of the

26:34.817 --> 26:49.101
Atlantic that we knew so little about. And I was 
able, because of my years with Woods Hole, work

26:56.082 --> 27:14.412
with Val Worthington and Fritz Fuglister and Dean 
Pompous and people at Woods Hole who were so

26:56.082 --> 27:14.412
knowledgeable about the North Atlantic and about 
seagoing techniques and about equipment and

26:56.082 --> 27:14.412
sampling. They went out with me on the early 
cruises to train me, and we had a cadre of enlisted

27:14.982 --> 27:27.411
men, a hydrographic division, it was called, on 
the ship under an ensign. And these young lads were

27:27.431 --> 27:33.244
the ones who worked with us as civilians, too. 
occupy the stations and the ships worked

27:33.697 --> 27:37.863
together. Ship A and Ship B would be on station and 
Ship A would go here and Ship B would go here and Ship

27:37.983 --> 27:48.419
A would go here and Ship B would go here. This went on 
week after week, month after month. We worked from

27:53.346 --> 28:01.358
Philadelphia to Iceland to Scapa Flow in 
Scotland, to Plymouth, to Gibraltar, to the

28:01.743 --> 28:21.257
Azores, to the Canary Islands, areas that just 
nobody had ever worked before since the days of the

28:01.743 --> 28:21.257
Carnegie and the Challenger and so forth. So when I 
did get polio, I was able to to use all of this

28:28.270 --> 28:32.756
knowledge and experience at a desk. So I did go to 
Hawaii in 1952 with the oceanographic program at

28:32.876 --> 28:53.265
the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries Lab and stayed 
there until 62 as their chief oceanographer and

28:32.876 --> 28:53.265
then the assistant director. 62, I had an offer to 
come to Washington to develop a laboratory that

28:53.954 --> 29:15.603
would have its base on Virginia Key in Miami to be 
the Bureau's, Department of Interior's, major

28:53.954 --> 29:15.603
oceanographic and fishery research lab in the 
southeastern United States. So after 10 years in

29:16.844 --> 29:22.712
Hawaii, I decided to come back to Washington.
