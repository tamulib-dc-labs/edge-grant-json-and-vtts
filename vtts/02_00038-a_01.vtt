WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:16.306
I'm sitting in John Capo's beautiful living room 
looking out over the lake and chatting with John

00:03.068 --> 00:16.306
about his experiences as a student. First 
question, why did you go to A&M? I went because my

00:21.473 --> 00:27.962
brother was going to A&M at the time and It made it 
easier and was probably the least expensive place

00:28.263 --> 00:37.334
I could find to go to school simply because we 
didn't have any money. As far as you know, did you

00:38.015 --> 00:41.820
have a choice if you had wanted one? Not really. No, 
my brother would have injured me again. He injured

00:49.250 --> 00:53.595
me many times being four years older than me. He 
would have done it again. Now, high school was

00:55.477 --> 00:56.999
where? Waco High School. Waco High School. You 
visited the campus many times then before going

00:59.843 --> 01:03.968
down to enroll. No, once. Once. What was your 
impression on that visit?

01:14.242 --> 01:15.904
It was a little stark. It was a little frightening 
because my background for a college campus was

01:16.390 --> 01:28.721
Baylor in Waco, which is gothic, beautiful, shady 
trees and so forth. College Station wasn't like

01:29.162 --> 01:32.945
that in 1948. Okay, so you enter in the fall of 1948. 
Yes. Describe how you got there, the trip, and what

01:39.811 --> 01:45.216
you took with you when you went to enroll? Who took 
you, how'd you? Okay, my father was quite ill. As a

01:49.497 --> 01:57.972
matter of fact, he died two weeks after I left to go 
to A&M. And so my brother took me to A&M. He was a

02:02.797 --> 02:13.229
senior at the time, having been at A&M, gone into 
the Army, and then come back from the Army and was

02:02.797 --> 02:13.229
there as a senior at the time. And so he took me, and I 
took one footlocker. And that footlocker had a few

02:19.236 --> 02:26.204
changes of clothes and some toiletry and some 
bedding. That was it. Because I really didn't know

02:28.531 --> 02:31.434
what I was going to need. He told me, this is what you 
need. Take it. Because in those days, freshmen

02:35.498 --> 02:41.223
were issued uniforms. So precious little 
clothing went.

02:46.448 --> 02:50.372
Can you recall your visual impression? You 
referred to it briefly a while ago. What was there?

02:55.137 --> 02:56.578
What buildings were there then? What was the 
campus? The campus was the old system, now I

02:57.877 --> 03:03.503
believe the Jack Williams building. The new area 
was new, which were the low three-story red brick

03:04.624 --> 03:13.453
dorms to the south. To the north was the library and 
the petroleum engineering building, and behind

03:13.473 --> 03:23.343
it was the chemistry building and the academic 
building, and then a few dorms.

03:26.186 --> 03:26.787
That was it. The new, new area didn't exist, which 
was over by Savisa. Savisa was there, of course.

03:34.419 --> 03:37.722
However, that wasn't my freshman impression. I 
was a freshman at Bryan Air Force Base. Oh, good. So

03:40.566 --> 03:46.153
my impression of A&M, when I went down to enroll as a 
freshman, was going into the Army. I lived in a

03:46.793 --> 03:50.778
barracks where we all lived in a row. Oh, good, 
good. Because, see, we haven't had many of those.

03:54.503 --> 03:55.744
All right, did you even... Go to the campus? Not as I 
came in to become a freshman, no. I did not even go to

04:01.873 --> 04:04.137
the campus. I had seen the campus before, but I went 
straight to Bryan Air Force Base. Describe

04:09.127 --> 04:11.351
physically what there was. Like any World War II 
base, you go through a gate with a guard on it. They

04:19.113 --> 04:23.319
wanted to make sure we stayed in there once we got 
there. Was this Guard Air Force? No, no, no. By then

04:26.664 --> 04:29.708
it was Texas A&M University. I take part in the A&M 
College of Texas. We drove down to what was an

04:34.475 --> 04:44.209
office building, again made out of wood, single 
story. asphalt shingle painted white and across

04:44.746 --> 04:51.177
from it was the chapel. Typical World War II, throw 
it up quickly, wooden Air Force base, Air Corps

04:51.277 --> 05:00.253
base. Behind it was a long row of barracks 
buildings where we would ultimately live. and

05:06.700 --> 05:09.824
some of them were converted into classrooms. 
Behind that was the flight line with hangars, and

05:10.425 --> 05:22.061
parked on the ramp outside were old Stearman 
bi-wing training planes. And that's what you saw

05:22.081 --> 05:25.366
when you wrote, when you came in. All right. This 
was not the first year for Fish out there, was it?

05:29.852 --> 05:31.053
No, it was the second. Second, all right. And all 
freshmen were out there? All freshmen went out

05:33.941 --> 05:35.863
there. OK. Describe how you then got checked in and 
so forth.

05:42.772 --> 05:43.492
Do you remember? Vaguely, because you're being 
herded like cattle. And you go from here to there

05:49.420 --> 05:52.444
and sign here. I believe that the registration 
occurred in what was the dining hall. tables were

06:01.342 --> 06:26.556
set around for the various classes and if you're 
going to take this english you go to that table and

06:01.342 --> 06:26.556
find a class that you can get into and get into it and 
then you move to the next and the next and the next

06:01.342 --> 06:26.556
these that's my impression i'm sorry it's a long 
about how many freshmen We were a pretty large

06:27.667 --> 06:29.309
class. There were nearly 1,000 of us as freshmen. 
And only freshmen? Only freshmen. Who was there to

06:36.938 --> 06:42.565
give leadership or orientation?

06:44.907 --> 06:57.302
There were army officers and sergeants in the army 
out of the staff of the commandant.

06:58.649 --> 07:04.596
tactical officers they are called, but we had both 
officers and sergeants. We did not have

07:04.696 --> 07:08.361
upperclassmen at all. So your class missed some of 
the campus hazing and so forth that might have,

07:08.601 --> 07:17.592
freshmen might have had. They made up for it when we 
were sophomores, so it's okay. Who were, do you

07:22.498 --> 07:27.103
remember the names of any of those key

07:28.197 --> 07:31.381
active duty attack officers and so forth? Who was 
Hayden Boatner? General Hayden L. Boatner was

07:33.764 --> 07:38.851
commandant and after that nobody was in part. Did 
you all see Boatner? Oh yes. Describe him and your

07:42.035 --> 07:43.897
impression of him. Small man, rotund, heavy set.

07:52.088 --> 07:53.209
Fixed face. Not a, no smile, strictly business, 
pure business by the numbers. One, two, three,

08:02.996 --> 08:04.678
welcome here. You are going to be, these people are 
going to tell you what to do and when to do and how to

08:04.879 --> 08:11.448
do it and you better do what they say. You took, do 
you remember how many hours you took? I think I took

08:15.434 --> 08:18.979
18. And you took all your courses out there? Yes. Do 
you remember any of the faculty members by name who

08:23.598 --> 08:29.747
were out there?

08:30.027 --> 08:33.252
Fish drill team was out there. I think it 
originated because we were isolated. That's what

08:37.097 --> 08:37.778
I've heard. It originated there because of the 
isolation. And I understand there was a fish band?

08:43.806 --> 08:44.047
Yes. Can you describe anything about either of 
those? Who was in them? Just the students. Same

08:51.544 --> 08:51.764
thing. No, but was it highly selected? Was it hard 
to get in the... It was not difficult to get in the

08:54.408 --> 08:55.990
band. It was difficult to get on the fish drill 
team. You had to be good. And you had to want to do it

08:58.734 --> 09:02.919
and so forth. But the band would take warm bodies 
because they were trying to put together a

09:02.939 --> 09:08.607
reasonable band. As a band has always been, as far 
as I know, it was not a formal organization or an

09:10.209 --> 09:18.881
official organization. It was... done on your own 
time and because you enjoyed being in a band. And it

09:25.415 --> 09:29.401
played for our parades out there. And they were 
generally people that had been through music in

09:31.424 --> 09:35.229
high school and were pretty good. They were good. 
We did a good job. We did go to the campus for

09:39.635 --> 09:46.084
football games and the Fish Band marched 
independently. Really? About how big was it? The

09:48.408 --> 09:48.808
number one? Very big. 100? No, I think 40, 50, 
small, small. All right, let's talk about that

09:56.120 --> 09:59.165
when you all went to the campus. About how often did 
you go to the campus? For a football game in the

10:02.491 --> 10:03.953
fall. It wasn't every weekend either. But you went 
to each football game? Yes. Okay, each home game.

10:09.963 --> 10:10.284
What else? If buses came, picked you up, you went 
in, you marched in, you stood where the freshmen

10:10.304 --> 10:15.212
stood. You were freshmen. It gave the 
upperclassmen a chance to look at you and to harass

10:19.248 --> 10:24.940
you a little bit. And at the end of the game, you were 
picked up and taken back to the airport base. All

10:30.913 --> 10:31.594
right. So did you all go for dances or concerts or 
chapel? No, we had a chapel out there. So football

10:40.371 --> 10:41.992
games? That's about the only thing we got in the 
fall. That's about the only thing that I can recall

10:44.615 --> 10:52.844
that we... Did we go for any other time? We, of 
course, were off on weekends, and because I had a

10:52.864 --> 11:04.177
brother over there, I would go on other weekends 
simply because my brother was there. But you

11:05.558 --> 11:07.000
didn't go over there and spend the night? Oh, no. 
How would... If you wanted to go, you or any of your

11:09.158 --> 11:15.109
buddies wanted to go, almost no one had a car, how 
did you get there? They ran buses. There were buses

11:17.974 --> 11:23.144
that went back and forth. You had to get back on that 
last bus. Now my brother had a car and

11:34.437 --> 11:37.160
Sometimes, if he was in a good mood, he'd bring me 
back. Other than that, he was a senior dealing with

11:38.461 --> 11:40.843
the pressure. The faculty that taught out at the 
air base lived out there? Or did they? I don't think

11:47.349 --> 11:48.530
so. I don't think so. The base housing, as I recall, 
was not occupied. You lived in a barracks? Classic

11:59.100 --> 12:00.381
barracks. No, you didn't have a room? No. There was 
a long single, the barrack was a long single room

12:02.838 --> 12:14.856
with double deck bunk stacked down the middle, a 
heater at each end and you were, the bunks were

12:02.838 --> 12:14.856
stacked between the two heaters.

12:17.980 --> 12:26.533
Your bunk mate, you had a desk on one end of your bunk 
and he had a desk on the floor on the other, a desk and

12:17.980 --> 12:26.533
chair. and that was your study place, and that was 
your bunk, so you had a little strip of floor about

12:27.037 --> 12:37.150
five feet wide. Had people walking behind you 
while you're trying to study up and down. Entrance

12:44.559 --> 12:49.025
hall and storage area on the front, and a toilet on 
the rear. Showers, et cetera, everything on the

12:49.706 --> 12:53.170
rear of the building. Where did you hang your 
clothing?

12:57.715 --> 13:01.382
We have a little locker beside your desk. Small, 
small locker beside your desk. Your foot locker

13:04.549 --> 13:06.372
went under the bed? Went at the foot of the bed, one 
on each end. See, in the military configuration of

13:13.046 --> 13:16.753
a pure barracks, they would have had two beds foot 
to foot in a wide aisle. By running only one bed

13:22.135 --> 13:28.325
width, there was a good amount of space on the 
outside. Now, since it was all freshmen, I'm

13:29.567 --> 13:37.960
assuming y'all didn't play many tricks on another 
student. No more than the normal. But I mean, you

13:39.663 --> 13:42.387
didn't hide somebody's footlocker. there were no 
drown outs and so forth? Oh yeah, there were drown

13:44.979 --> 13:47.042
outs, sure. You know, just to hassle somebody. A 
great recreation was to cut across the air field to

13:50.187 --> 13:56.676
the bridge. Brazos County was dry and so you could, 
if you hiked across the air base, and didn't follow

14:05.603 --> 14:07.084
the highway. It was only about three miles to the 
bridge, and there was, of course, liquor and beer

14:07.204 --> 14:14.511
across the bridge. The big deal was to go over and 
get the beer and drink it back. Did any of those

14:19.916 --> 14:21.538
places have a name? I'm sure they did. But you don't 
remember? No. I'm sure they had a name. There had

14:27.804 --> 14:30.626
been gambling there during the war. Was there any 
gambling available then? Not that I know of. Okay.

14:34.848 --> 14:45.925
And there had been a house of ill repute over there, 
reputed during the war.

14:45.965 --> 14:58.484
Describe

14:45.965 --> 14:58.484
for me a typical class day routine. Got up at what 
time, did what, under what sequence? You got up in

15:02.149 --> 15:04.112
the morning early. You assembled on the street in 
front of the barracks. And the role was called

15:09.907 --> 15:18.216
wearing the uniform of the day, whatever it may 
have been. Whatever the uniform of the day was, you

15:20.618 --> 15:26.184
assembled in front of the building in the uniform 
of the day. And you marched to the dining hall for

15:26.945 --> 15:32.310
breakfast. After eating,

15:32.864 --> 15:47.064
you found your way to wherever you were to be next, 
either back to your barracks or to your first

15:32.864 --> 15:47.064
class, as the case may be. It was then typical 
university. During the day, you went from class to

15:51.731 --> 15:54.134
class. If you had time off, you went back to the 
barracks or the gymnasium was active and open.

16:00.910 --> 16:06.599
Pick up football games and baseball games were 
always going on. Did you fall in and march to midday

16:06.619 --> 16:09.704
meal? No. No, because you were quite scattered out 
and there wasn't time. There wasn't time.

16:18.698 --> 16:24.167
Everybody ate within one hour and you could not get 
assembled. do the marching. You did at night. You

16:27.128 --> 16:28.570
marched back at night. Again, you reassembled for 
the evening meeting. And then again, you were on

16:32.095 --> 16:34.258
your own. We had a lights out. And I don't remember 
the time. 10 or 10.30 was early, which meant you had

16:38.703 --> 16:42.128
to get your studying done. And they were checking 
on you to make sure you had your head in focus. By and

16:47.635 --> 16:49.958
large, you studied at your desk. At your desk. Was 
there a library of any sort, any kind of a building?

16:55.212 --> 16:55.633
No.

16:59.319 --> 17:10.498
If you needed something

16:59.319 --> 17:10.498
from the library, you determined what it was, and 
it was brought to you from the campus. Where were

17:10.518 --> 17:12.221
the classes held? They were held in what had been I 
suppose office buildings and some of the barracks

17:16.308 --> 17:24.220
converted

17:16.308 --> 17:24.220
into classes. There was still in the, because the 
airplanes were stored there, the Air Force still

17:24.921 --> 17:37.960
had storage stuff around, so really the 
university did not occupy every building on the

17:24.921 --> 17:37.960
base. Do you remember any classes that anyone 
wanted to take that were not available? No, I don't

17:45.704 --> 17:48.989
think they were offered. In those days, you had a 
pretty packed freshman course. If you are going to

17:53.055 --> 18:00.306
be a freshman and you're going for a science 
degree, these are the courses that you will take as

17:53.055 --> 18:00.306
a freshman. If you're going for an arts degree, 
these are the courses that you will take as a

18:00.326 --> 18:04.673
freshman. But there were freshman courses that 
engineering majors, science majors, and so on?

18:09.220 --> 18:09.400
Yes. What was your major? Mine was science. I went 
for engineering. Engineering, so I was after

18:12.653 --> 18:14.275
science. So from day one, that was your goal. Let's 
see. Okay, then let's say you wanted to take a nap in

18:20.100 --> 18:25.305
the middle of the afternoon. Was that even 
possible in that barracks? Well, you learn to.

18:31.070 --> 18:41.260
Yeah, people are coming in hollering and throwing 
their books down and so forth, but you could do the

18:31.070 --> 18:41.260
best you can, but there was no guarantee of peace, 
no. All right, then tell me what y'all, now you had

18:41.527 --> 18:44.952
Saturday morning classes. Let's say it's now noon 
Saturday. What would have been a weekend of fun and

18:47.736 --> 18:54.085
relaxation? What did y'all do on Saturday 
afternoon, night, and Sunday? That's usually

18:58.612 --> 19:02.277
when you would see pickup sports around. Go to 
town, go to a movie. Go to town meant to do that?

19:09.608 --> 19:09.728
Right. Debride, not College Station. How did you 
get to work? Again, buses ran. A few people had

19:15.541 --> 19:21.230
cars, except so many of my friends did. But a movie, 
a few sports, that's pretty much, it was bare

19:22.752 --> 19:32.487
bones. Now, on Saturday night, was there a bed 
check? Yes. Yes. Sunday, were there religious

19:40.246 --> 19:44.392
services out there? There was usually a religious 
service at the chapel. You were free to go to town to

19:50.942 --> 19:56.070
any church you wanted to go to. Or you were free not 
to go to church, as you may see fit. I would guess

20:00.457 --> 20:07.407
that most of the freshmen, the majority of them, 
slept until noon. It was a chance to get some sleep,

20:08.348 --> 20:14.739
and the vast majority did. So that's the only day 
that there wasn't a morning fallout. Yes, Sunday.

20:22.051 --> 20:26.218
How were you all, on a weekday, how were you 
awakened? By what method? Well, the bugle,

20:34.825 --> 20:45.986
recording that or it was at all army bases through 
loudspeakers all over everywhere and would wake

20:34.825 --> 20:45.986
the dead with its volume was there. You were 
usually up before that because you had a limited

20:46.187 --> 20:54.302
number of people could take a shower at a time. A 
limited number could shave at a time. And so if you

20:58.008 --> 21:09.823
were smart, you were probably up before that, 
particularly if you have an 8 o'clock class and

20:58.008 --> 21:09.823
can't come back after breakfast. If you can't come 
back to the dorm, you're up long before that

21:09.863 --> 21:13.448
vehicle. Who was it that

21:13.468 --> 21:22.599
informed you all, prepared you for any traditions 
and slang and so forth? Was that done that year? Not

21:25.079 --> 21:25.740
really. Not really. There was some of it that went 
along. But no, not really. You picked up a little

21:32.607 --> 21:40.435
bit from the upperclassmen when you were on campus 
for football afternoons. You picked a little bit

21:40.455 --> 21:42.117
up then. But no, not really. So you didn't know Agus 
Lane then for food yet? Yeah, you learned all of

21:49.565 --> 21:51.166
that. I don't remember how, whether it was just 
natural Because y'all wouldn't have whipped out

21:56.905 --> 21:59.349
to another fish. No, not really. We did insist when 
you were with a group, you met everybody in the

22:03.516 --> 22:10.026
group, but not the formal thing. Not the standard 
attention. You must have been organized as

22:13.552 --> 22:17.558
companies. And so a fellow freshman was the 
company Yes. Leader? There would be a company

22:26.537 --> 22:38.375
commander and he was usually the, he was selected 
by the staff, by the tactical officer. What

22:38.435 --> 22:40.418
company were you in? I wish you hadn't asked me 
that. I have the slightest notion. Did the company

22:44.484 --> 22:48.630
have anything to do with the branch in which you 
hoped to be? They were broken down into Army and Air

22:50.451 --> 22:52.794
Force. Those were the only two divisions. And that 
was a selection you could make coming here. See, I

22:59.464 --> 23:01.907
haven't run into many people who were out there. 
That's why I'm quizzing you. We were pretty stark

23:04.872 --> 23:07.015
and pretty minimal. And a whole lot of people 
didn't stay. It just wasn't what a college

23:10.039 --> 23:14.325
experience should be. It was not. Of the 
approximately 1,000 who started, About how many

23:19.812 --> 23:22.656
were back as sophomores? Less than half. Less than 
half. A lot before Christmas. A lot didn't come

23:27.722 --> 23:29.685
back after Christmas. And even more didn't come 
back. All right. You came to campus for football

23:32.448 --> 23:35.112
games. What about midnight Yale practice? No. We 
did Yale practice out there. Basketball games? In

23:42.221 --> 23:43.643
the spring. That was an option, but there were 
really too many. You know, basketball games go on

23:46.694 --> 23:55.084
every day of the week, and there were really too 
many, and the pressure was too great with

23:46.694 --> 23:55.084
transportation tonight. Did you all come for 
final review? Yes. Describe what it was like to be

23:58.268 --> 24:05.536
in final review, and you're going to become no 
longer a freshman. Again, we marched as our own

24:05.556 --> 24:10.322
units, and it was... if you will, just another 
parade because we marched as our own units. So it

24:19.593 --> 24:25.220
was really, you know, final review is a big deal to 
us, but it's just another damn parade. And you were

24:25.240 --> 24:27.282
on the drill field? On where the MSC now. That was 
the only place. But it was then, it had nothing on

24:33.390 --> 24:37.315
the south side of it, did it? No, no. They were 
clearing and preparing to build the Student

24:40.120 --> 24:44.545
Center. So that was the beginning of construction 
of the Student Center. I think we actually got into

24:50.231 --> 24:54.716
the Student Center during my sophomore year. I 
think that somewhere in there we got into the

24:55.517 --> 24:59.981
Student Center. But I remember the construction. 
What is your memory of the quality of food served

25:03.886 --> 25:07.950
out at the Air Base? You know, I never complained 
about the food. It was good food. It was well

25:14.651 --> 25:16.523
prepared. I had no complaints. I came from a 
background where sometimes we had one meal a day.

25:24.567 --> 25:27.572
So three meals a day, I didn't eat anything. It 
didn't matter. And you all did not, I believe you

25:28.694 --> 25:35.605
said you did not have any of the games, the rituals 
out there. No. All of that came in the sophomore

25:37.228 --> 25:41.295
year and was an intense thing. Okay, now let's move 
to that sophomore year. You come to the campus and

25:43.898 --> 25:46.421
you're on the campus. Where did you live as a 
sophomore? Over in what is known as the new area.

25:51.608 --> 25:54.872
The low red brick buildings, dorms one through 12. 
And you were in? I was in dorm five. What after? E

26:01.200 --> 26:03.463
Battery Field Artillery. Did it have a nickname? 
No.

26:08.970 --> 26:10.692
Nicknames, I think, came later. Those are later 
innovations. What did the juniors and seniors do

26:12.091 --> 26:18.181
to y'all that was kind of initiation-like? 
Treated us like freshmen are treated today.

26:23.730 --> 26:27.857
So you had to clean some upperclassmen's room? 
Yes, but we now were a little bit more mature. You

26:30.942 --> 26:34.408
would do it, but you wouldn't take a whole lot. You 
would take a lot off of an upperclassman. But if one

26:37.655 --> 26:45.064
got a little bit carried away, he would get it back, 
usually in spades. Describe that part. What might

26:48.068 --> 26:51.212
happen to a junior or senior who became abusive? 
Well, his room could disappear and no one would

26:51.632 --> 26:58.501
tell him where it was and everything in it. And 
where would it? Into the steam tunnels. He usually

27:02.566 --> 27:04.168
knew where to go look for it. But it's a hard job to 
haul your bed and your mattress and your books when

27:04.958 --> 27:11.225
they've been scattered through the steam 
tunnels. There's a lot of miles, a lot not miles,

27:11.565 --> 27:18.673
but there's hundreds of yards of steam tunnels 
under the ground there. And he could come back to

27:19.374 --> 27:22.257
his room and there would be nothing there. And that 
would usually deliver him, sometimes he would get

27:23.138 --> 27:27.923
mean to the entire class. And so once we took a guy, 
almost to the airport and tied him to a tree. And

27:36.996 --> 27:39.359
nobody had any idea what happened to him. It was 
about 20 hours before they found him. Then he

27:43.325 --> 27:45.167
didn't bother us anymore. And he knew who it was? Of 
course. It was very important that he know who did

27:49.233 --> 27:51.396
it. Other good bull? Oh my. Did y'all ever put 
anything in anyone's room that exploded? Yes, we

28:02.333 --> 28:04.896
did all of those things. Firecrackers inside of a 
bag of flour, which will multiply its energy by a

28:05.536 --> 28:11.823
thousand times.

28:14.486 --> 28:17.288
You know, just like a grain elevator explosion. 
You just need a small firecracker and a paper bag of

28:17.609 --> 28:27.099
flour, and that's a multiplication many times 
over the power of the firecracker. Water. always

28:29.587 --> 28:33.631
water every night somebody is going to get it. And 
it's usually an upperclassman. It's usually that

28:35.693 --> 28:42.419
junior or senior that's going to get it, because 
the sophomore is the one who feels abused. And

28:42.499 --> 28:45.862
somebody's going to pay one way or another. In 
general, were these pranks played on somebody

28:46.463 --> 28:52.929
that had done this? Yes. Yes. It was in 
retribution, without question. They were

28:56.512 --> 28:59.475
generally retribution.

29:01.109 --> 29:02.431
A little bit of difference. By Thanksgiving, the 
bullshit was over.

29:11.829 --> 29:15.536
After you came back from Thanksgiving, it was 
generally over. By the time you come back from

29:16.337 --> 29:20.485
Christmas, you're just another member of the 
outfit. And the upperclassmen behaved that way?

29:25.677 --> 29:28.682
Yes, yes, the upperclassmen treated you that way. 
By the time you came back at Christmas, it was all

29:28.702 --> 29:31.666
over with. Oh, you got a frog or two in that came in at 
mid-semester, and so you had to, they would hassle

29:31.686 --> 29:46.548
him a little bit, and he would be totally not 
understanding, why me, God, you know, and all of

29:31.686 --> 29:46.548
these other people. Normally, frogs came from 
what students? Well, people that had graduated

29:49.118 --> 30:00.057
from high school in January or in December, as the 
case may be, and entered as a freshman at

29:49.118 --> 30:00.057
mid-semester. Right, but now there were frogs who 
transferred from other schools. Yes, yes. That

30:04.165 --> 30:05.687
could happen, too. Was anyone from JTAC or NTAC? 
Not in my outfit. All right. Oh, I was going to ask if

30:11.100 --> 30:16.548
they were treated differently from this 
mid-semester high school grade. No, they would

30:16.568 --> 30:18.431
have had the same hassle. Now, it didn't last long, 
30, 45 days, because everybody's burned out and

30:18.531 --> 30:24.839
tired of it. It's spring, and we're worn out with 
that stuff. So it's a little flurry, and then it's

30:30.547 --> 30:34.673
gone. All right. Describe the child fall routine. 
for sophomore Duncan Collin? You're talking

30:42.308 --> 30:43.630
about in September. In September, not much 
different than a freshman would experience

30:44.431 --> 30:49.919
today. But again, by November, they're no 
different than a sophomore today. The senior and

30:59.254 --> 31:03.160
junior eats first, and then you eat. But no more 
table hassling. But you were, for the first few

31:06.625 --> 31:10.751
months, you were to serve them? Yeah, you pretty 
much sat at attention and ate when you were told to

31:11.372 --> 31:16.761
eat. And if you were told not to eat, you didn't eat. 
And all of those good things. The good jobs,

31:23.311 --> 31:28.760
waiting tables, usually went to the juniors and 
seniors. Those were the best jobs. Now, those were

31:31.263 --> 31:33.527
also good juniors and seniors. who made sure that 
nobody went without food. If you stayed at that

31:38.195 --> 31:43.230
table, they'd bring you out a complete table 
serving
