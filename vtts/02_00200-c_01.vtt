WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:05.186
These guys weren't that much bigger than I was. And 
I was small. And you look at some of the kids today

00:07.609 --> 00:18.582
that play football particularly, but even 
basketball, and they're lots bigger than the kids

00:07.609 --> 00:18.582
back then. We had, you know, Stallings wasn't much 
bigger than I was. And a college kid that weighed

00:24.809 --> 00:27.692
200 pounds Well, Charlie Kruger was one of the 
largest. Yeah. And Pardee, Crowe, they probably

00:33.288 --> 00:42.083
as seniors barely made 200. But Gene Stoll was 
probably 170. Bobby Marks was 155, 160. Randy Sims

00:50.825 --> 00:54.031
was not that big. Bobby Drake Keith. And several of 
them made the pros. You know, St. Louis, I think two

00:58.218 --> 01:02.325
or three Aggies when they graduated here went to 
St. Louis. Cardinals had played for years. As far

01:04.308 --> 01:10.258
as you students knew, did those Bear Bryant 
athletes go to class? I saw several of them in my

01:12.863 --> 01:14.706
classes. Did y'all ever hear- Roper was a senior, a 
center, and he was an ag major. Did y'all ever hear

01:20.597 --> 01:24.784
of any- Well, Murray Trimble, I don't know if 
Murray ever went. The reputation on campus was

01:27.088 --> 01:31.155
that he was a hell raiser. But as far as I know, They 
were in class, but I couldn't vouch for it. But

01:39.583 --> 01:44.834
y'all didn't hear any stories about any classes 
specifically for athletes only? I didn't. I don't

01:47.298 --> 01:48.661
think there were any. I'm not aware of it. Let's 
see. What was Yale practice like in that time?

01:58.055 --> 02:01.659
Well, his pinky down was cutting off his tie and 
throwing it out. And of course, there were always

02:01.899 --> 02:08.908
some Aggie fables told by the yell leaders. And it 
was held where? It was over in the Grove. In the

02:12.172 --> 02:12.932
Grove. Yeah. And it was just another one of those 
sweat times when sophomores just loved to chew on

02:13.413 --> 02:20.802
freshmen. What hour of the Friday night? Usually

02:24.194 --> 02:28.800
it was about midnight. So it really was at 
midnight. Yes. And we would have sometimes more

02:31.223 --> 02:47.563
than one yell practice in a week because we marched 
right after supper over and spent about an hour

02:31.223 --> 02:47.563
getting ready for an opponent that weekend. But 
yell practice on Friday night was at midnight. All

02:54.299 --> 02:57.204
right, Secretary, don't type this in here. It's 
not part of it. One of RC's suggestions for the

02:58.968 --> 03:13.354
leadership to consider is to move Yale practice 
earlier on Friday night so the team can go and

02:58.968 --> 03:13.354
participate in the enthusiasm and know of the 
support they have, and to have Yale practice at,

03:13.992 --> 03:19.063
say, 8 o'clock. And still get a good night's sleep. 
And still get a good night's sleep, which I think is

03:20.987 --> 03:23.452
a good idea. But apparently that's getting a lot of 
second thought by students saying, no, no, we've

03:24.535 --> 03:30.668
never done it that way before. Well, we have. It 
used to be earlier during the week if we had the Yelp

03:33.276 --> 03:40.169
practice on a Thursday or on a Wednesday. And it was 
always in the grove, all four years? I don't

03:44.697 --> 03:47.983
remember having Yelp practice any place but the 
grove. Describe, then, home game Saturday. What

03:52.169 --> 03:53.533
time did things start? What did take through the 
whole day? Well, you'd fall out about the same time

03:55.738 --> 04:01.972
that we did during the regular weekday, about 6. 
We'd march over to Sabisa or Duncan, eat, and then

04:06.980 --> 04:12.666
come back and usually had a room inspection. Well, 
you went to class. Well, we had Saturday morning

04:14.487 --> 04:16.629
classes. But we'd usually have, on Saturday, we'd 
usually have a room inspection to see that

04:16.649 --> 04:32.565
everything was ship shape and we knew how to make a 
bed and we knew how to, and this was usually with a

04:16.649 --> 04:32.565
military science officer being accompanied by 
the first sergeant and CO. Then we would fall out

04:33.406 --> 04:52.353
usually about, if it was a 2 o'clock game, we'd fall 
out about 12.30 or 1 and march over as a unit and move

04:33.406 --> 04:52.353
up into the freshman section and sophomore 
section and juniors and seniors. I think that's

04:52.454 --> 04:57.301
even precedent today, at least in the court. And 
then participate in the yelling at the game. Those

05:03.798 --> 05:07.203
things haven't changed a whole lot. We stood up.

05:12.811 --> 05:16.917
The uniform, of course, was worn all week. Anytime 
you were on campus, you were in uniform. As you

05:20.963 --> 05:31.037
recall, what were some of your happiest football 
games and your most unhappy, disappointed games?

05:31.928 --> 05:54.139
Well of course the winning against the University 
of Texas was a thrill because it had been a bunch of

05:31.928 --> 05:54.139
years since we had won a Texas game but being here 
with Bear Bryant's era you got the impression that

05:31.928 --> 05:54.139
A&M had always been good had always won, and when 
Hank Fulberg and Jim Fry came as coaches in the 60s

05:54.490 --> 06:07.326
and 70s, you just couldn't believe what had 
happened. It was difficult surviving those years

06:07.446 --> 06:18.220
after being spoiled with your introduction as an 
Aggie to the Bear Bind era. Now, we had the tough 58

06:18.908 --> 06:26.099
with the Rice and the Texas loss, two points and one 
point. But other than that, every time we played,

06:26.119 --> 06:31.166
we expected to win. I mean, seriously expected to 
win. It wasn't a fantasy. Were you at that Rice

06:35.693 --> 06:36.835
game? Yes. What did you guys do after it was over? 
Just stood there and tried to get out of shock. Same

06:47.393 --> 06:49.856
way with Texas. Even though it had been tempered 
that, well, A&M might be beaten because you just

06:49.877 --> 06:58.969
didn't entertain that. I mean, it was something 
that was so ridiculous that you just didn't

06:59.090 --> 07:08.383
entertain the thought that we had two more games 
won. And describe a typical G. Raleigh White home

07:10.846 --> 07:16.354
basketball game for you students. very much like a 
football game. We filled the place and we yelled

07:19.414 --> 07:28.529
and at that time of course you didn't think about it 
but the players were all white. And I was trying to

07:30.132 --> 07:33.718
think of the first colored basketball player that 
A&M had. It was shortly after. Must have been

07:39.363 --> 07:44.971
Shelby's third or fourth year as head coach. 
Because I can't remember his name, but I remember

07:45.011 --> 07:48.136
when that happened. Let's see. I think SMU had had a 
black player the year before, and then A&M had

07:51.882 --> 07:58.672
recruited a black player. And the whole band was at 
the basketball games. Yeah. The band came, and

08:02.217 --> 08:14.596
then half of the Corps, essentially, the Army 
units had one home game, and then the Air Force

08:02.217 --> 08:14.596
would have the next one. And so you got to go, and I 
don't ever remember seeing tickets. Of course,

08:18.943 --> 08:23.550
when we went to football games, I don't ever 
remember seeing a ticket that I had. We marched

08:24.111 --> 08:30.300
into the game, and then essentially filed up into 
the stands like the band does now. We didn't march

08:30.719 --> 08:33.323
back out. So I'm sure that somewhere in there, 
there were tickets purchased. But the CO or first

08:41.295 --> 08:43.999
sergeant handled all those. What did you and your 
buddies think about the Aggie Band?

08:52.933 --> 08:57.840
I think we were really envious because they got to 
do a lot of traveling. But we were impressed by the

08:58.445 --> 09:02.008
band's performance. We were always proud of the 
Aggie band. How much prestige did the band

09:05.852 --> 09:12.238
commander have among student leaders?

09:12.258 --> 09:14.881
That was David Eller as a senior.

09:17.783 --> 09:18.604
None particular. Not at all comparable to corps 
commander? No. And on the campus when you were

09:23.829 --> 09:27.793
president of student government, Did you feel 
that you were equal to the Corps commander in

09:28.313 --> 09:32.339
prestige? No. Don Cloud's position was very, very 
unique and highly respected. But after that, what

09:40.851 --> 09:46.420
was next in prestige? Well, the whole Corps staff, 
I think, from the standpoint of this total student

09:47.621 --> 09:56.194
body, once you became familiar with what went on 
down here, I think the core staff members were

09:56.731 --> 10:04.362
viewed as being the leadership on campus. Then you 
had the student senate and the officers of each

10:04.622 --> 10:11.132
class. What about your leaders? They were in a 
class by themselves.

10:19.844 --> 10:22.688
That was a different kind of leadership. they were 
responsible for the morale of Aggies so they fit a

10:23.613 --> 10:50.582
little different mold they weren't expected to 
behave the same as a class president or a corps

10:23.613 --> 10:50.582
staff member

10:23.613 --> 10:50.582
Smokey Hyde for instance wasn't expected to do the 
same things that Don Cloud did. What about RVs?

10:57.163 --> 11:10.638
Very

10:57.163 --> 11:10.638
worthy, sought after opportunity. Very unique 
group. Only the very best would be able to become a

11:14.602 --> 11:20.468
Ross volunteer. had the unique opportunity to be 
the governor's honor guard and to go to New

11:21.190 --> 11:29.740
Orleans. Were you an RV? Yes. Until I got kicked 
out. For what? For missing too many practices as

11:34.806 --> 11:40.572
chairman of... This was your senior year? No, 
junior year. Junior year. Yeah, I had gotten in

11:43.616 --> 11:50.944
RVs, gotten a uniform, had drilled with them for 
about two months, And then I had a student

11:51.397 --> 12:00.832
government conference and a Texas state science 
convention. And I didn't know that that could

12:02.294 --> 12:05.459
happen. Got back and had been gone two weeks, and 
they said, if you can't drill, you can't be with us.

12:13.112 --> 12:16.577
Now, how did you learn that you were going to be a 
member? Because you didn't run for it. You weren't

12:19.073 --> 12:19.894
elected. I think the military science department 
selected. I'm not even sure. I got a letter

12:25.180 --> 12:32.168
indicating that I had been selected as a Ross 
volunteer. So you didn't apply. You weren't

12:35.132 --> 12:37.595
interviewed. I wasn't. I didn't. I just got a 
letter indicating that I had been selected as a

12:40.621 --> 12:44.945
Ross Volunteer. And I believe that that letter was 
signed by Colonel Joe Davis, the Commandant of

12:45.466 --> 12:54.715
Military Science.

12:55.756 --> 13:00.721
What did you do with the uniform after you were 
dropped?

13:02.742 --> 13:04.104
Did you keep it, turn it back? I believe that it was 
checked out. I don't even remember What happened

13:08.903 --> 13:14.472
to the uniform after I was booted out of the Ross 
Volunteers? All right. Did you know that when you

13:15.433 --> 13:19.259
were a student, did you know there were some secret 
fraternities? Oh, yeah. Well, there was the mole

13:21.863 --> 13:33.061
men that by reputation controlled the campus and 
lived down in the steam tunnels. Never knowingly

13:33.562 --> 13:36.987
met a mole man. But about 90% of the people that I 
knew were reportedly in that organization. And

13:46.176 --> 13:54.368
they were always being quoted in the bat, not by 
name, but as a bone man. What about, did you hear of

13:54.408 --> 13:58.134
the TTs and the stickers? Not I. Really?

14:03.791 --> 14:07.896
What was the purpose of the Mole Men as far as you 
knew? To represent the student body in issues on

14:08.737 --> 14:30.345
campus relating to those student gripes and 
things that we didn't appreciate and to try to

14:08.737 --> 14:30.345
control the

14:31.253 --> 14:38.889
staff over at the Military Science Department 
that were always there watching every unit. It was

14:40.954 --> 14:43.339
an opportunity to let off steam. Now let's see, 
there were, the impact of veterans on the student

14:45.547 --> 14:55.182
body during your day was comparatively small. 
Yes, there were very few here. We didn't have a war

14:57.546 --> 15:02.975
that ended where they came back here in any 
significant numbers. So almost all of the

15:03.135 --> 15:06.320
students were right out of high school. 
Essentially. So let's return back to the

15:08.584 --> 15:10.927
diversity. Were there some Jewish kids that you 
knew? Not that I was aware of. I'm sure that there

15:16.823 --> 15:21.670
were in our outfit, but they didn't stand out. They 
weren't different. Were there any international

15:22.892 --> 15:24.674
students? Not really. We had a few graduate 
students, and I can remember in entomology there

15:26.898 --> 15:33.287
were one or two from India. Were there many 
students from other states? Not really. I don't

15:39.682 --> 15:41.986
remember any in our outfit. They were all from 
Texas. Alright, what was it that drew these

15:44.671 --> 15:50.921
students together, whatever they were from? Why 
were y'all? I think the core. It shaped and formed

15:55.609 --> 16:01.740
everything other than your academic life. And so, 
in many respects, about the only difference is

16:03.391 --> 16:11.373
whether you came from the city or whether you came 
from the country. And there were some

16:12.456 --> 16:15.223
differences. in that respect in your history and 
your experiences and how you thought but those

16:16.823 --> 16:44.552
fairly quickly vanished as far as you became the 
same when you put on the same clothes you have to go

16:16.823 --> 16:44.552
through the same drill and harassment you're 
taking the same courses there's a lot of

16:16.823 --> 16:44.552
uniformity that took place We didn't have people, 
as I always say, we didn't have none of my friends

16:45.646 --> 16:56.240
that shaved their legs out here. And what were the 
events that contributed most? You mentioned the

17:03.089 --> 17:03.931
Corps. What else, what are the events, the 
activities that contributed most to that unity,

17:04.391 --> 17:11.721
that spirit? the harassment and the recognition 
that if you were going to survive you'd better

17:13.220 --> 17:38.738
stick together because if you got separated you 
got the good fortune of having five or six

17:13.220 --> 17:38.738
sophomores on you all at one time so it was the 
recognition that you were in this thing together

17:39.410 --> 17:47.942
and that the only way you were gonna survive was to 
have five or six fish buddies with you all the time.

17:48.784 --> 17:50.346
All right, so teamwork. Absolutely. And what 
about Yale practice and football games and

17:51.728 --> 17:58.337
bonfire? Those were the opportunity to get away 
from the dorm life. And there weren't a whole lot of

18:08.924 --> 18:18.192
those as you look back and you look at what this 
campus and being an Aggie today is about.

18:23.357 --> 18:26.440
But I think our expectations were a lot different. 
We hadn't come from a background that had to be

18:27.060 --> 18:35.588
entertained, that had to have air conditioning. 
I'd never seen TV when I came to A&M. There was a TV in

18:39.620 --> 18:45.609
a hardware store on the square in Wellington. It 
wasn't Sullivan's. It sat in the window, but all

18:50.977 --> 18:53.681
you could see was snow. And Saturday night when 
we'd go to town to get groceries, there'd be a big

18:53.801 --> 19:01.993
crowd watching that silly TV set and all you could 
see was snow. You couldn't see figures on it. But I

19:05.050 --> 19:08.214
saw my first TV set in the MSC. It wasn't really 
good, and it was small, but I saw my first TV set

19:08.234 --> 19:13.641
there. These other activities, do you remember 
your first silver taps? Not vividly, but I

19:21.951 --> 19:32.064
remember silver taps and the solemnness and how 
quiet things were and how dark it was. Did you and

19:32.184 --> 19:33.906
your buddies take it seriously? Yes. It was a very 
reverent time. Generally we knew the individual

19:39.055 --> 19:47.885
personally that had been killed because by and 
large you knew every student on this campus. Some

19:48.105 --> 19:52.931
you couldn't remember their names, but they 
usually helped you every time you forgot. They

19:52.971 --> 19:55.674
helped you remember the next time. But it was a very 
moving experience. to everyone because you knew

20:01.632 --> 20:03.495
that person. And it was a little bit like having a 
cousin. Did you go to Muster? Yes. Where was it

20:09.244 --> 20:10.065
held? It was held in G. Raleigh. And what did that 
seem to be to you? A

20:15.654 --> 20:21.143
daytime silver tap. It was very solemn. Muster 
hadn't changed all that much. RVs came in and

20:27.012 --> 20:29.495
fired. Many of the same activities that happened 
today happened in the 50s and probably the 30s and

20:30.276 --> 20:40.049
the 20s at Muster. You would have an Aggie speaker 
that talked about their experiences.

20:49.402 --> 20:53.948
Then the names of those that had passed away would 
be called off. Someone would answer here. And it

20:59.159 --> 21:08.055
was one of those experiences that you remember 
because of its impact on you.

21:12.223 --> 21:15.750
Your senior boots, how much did they cost? $76. 
Where'd you get them? From a senior that graduated

21:17.553 --> 21:19.677
the year before. And they almost fit. And how long 
did you keep them? That year. When I graduated, I

21:26.449 --> 21:29.132
sold them to a junior. Did you make any profit? No. 
They sold for about $75 a year for break-even. Did

21:37.402 --> 21:38.643
you enjoy wearing them? What did senior boots mean 
to you internally? Well, they represented

21:42.067 --> 21:48.555
achieving something you'd spent three years 
trying to achieve. and

21:49.953 --> 22:14.965
it was you just knew that that that was impressive 
and you didn't know for sure a lot of times I can

21:49.953 --> 22:14.965
remember Fish Van Zant and I fortunately we both 
didn't decide to quit at the same time we'd take

21:49.953 --> 22:14.965
time we'd swap off I'd come in disgusted about 
something or down about something and be ready to

22:15.434 --> 22:30.106
quit and go home and Fish Van Zant would say, no, we 
can't do that and give me all the reasons and then

22:15.434 --> 22:30.106
next week would be his time to be ready to quit. But 
it was, you had paid your dues and it was something

22:31.147 --> 22:45.019
that you felt like was earned and was worth what 
you'd invested in it and I I've always used the

22:45.978 --> 23:08.323
bonfire collapse thing you could read articles 
and you could tell whether someone who had been

22:45.978 --> 23:08.323
around this place wrote the article in the first 
two paragraphs or if it was someone from the

22:45.978 --> 23:08.323
international media that really didn't know what 
A&M was about and I've always thought it was funny

23:08.641 --> 23:36.100
that people didn't understand and you couldn't 
explain exactly to them what it's like and unless

23:08.641 --> 23:36.100
you've lived through it you really can't my kids 
both said daddy you didn't really do that did you

23:08.641 --> 23:36.100
and about half the things that I say is they didn't 
believe How did you feel wearing those boots for

23:36.805 --> 23:44.776
the first time at the final review as you were a 
junior? They were very uncomfortable, but I

23:45.116 --> 23:48.961
wasn't going to ever admit it. Clumsy. I'd worn 
boots, cowboy boots, all my life, so part of it

23:52.306 --> 23:58.815
wasn't all that new. But you felt very proud, but 
they weren't really that comfortable. You were

24:05.243 --> 24:05.884
awkward. For you, were there any special people in 
the audience that day at Final Review your junior

24:06.252 --> 24:11.920
year? My mom and dad came down. And when did you? All 
of your buddies were there. That had become

24:22.176 --> 24:23.658
family. It really had.

24:28.565 --> 24:35.095
By the end of your freshman year, those guys are 
important to you. And if they're there for

24:35.902 --> 24:48.519
something, that's as special as when you're in 
high school and your mom and dad are at an event.

24:48.880 --> 24:58.633
So you have a different circle of really good, 
close friends that are important to you. Was

24:58.653 --> 25:00.756
buying that Aggie ring important? Oh, yeah. I 
think that's always been important. How much did

25:03.688 --> 25:05.872
that cost? $126, $127. And that was all your money? 
Yes. You had earned it. Yeah. And I never knew

25:11.663 --> 25:23.205
whether the rumor was that the association paid 
for half of it, but I've been told and never have

25:11.663 --> 25:23.205
honestly looked into it. that no that the rate that 
ball for sets is what you pay and it I know that it

25:23.557 --> 25:43.253
changes from year to year because uh when my 
daughter bought her Aggie ring in 82 about three or

25:23.557 --> 25:43.253
four years later she priced rings and they were 
cheaper because gold had gone down and she was told

25:43.688 --> 25:59.651
by the ring clerk over there that it depended on the 
price of gold and there was a time when gold was very

25:43.688 --> 25:59.651
high and has been off of course recently. Do you 
have any ring stories? Have you had any

26:01.253 --> 26:02.996
interesting experiences? Well the only thing 
that happened is when

26:09.440 --> 26:34.350
A&M became coed and non compulsory military I had 
several of my classmates to send me their rings as

26:09.440 --> 26:34.350
class agent and I had four rings for probably five 
years and then they got in touch with me all of them

26:09.440 --> 26:34.350
now gradually got in touch with me and said would I 
send it back So I did. But I had four rings that were

26:37.055 --> 26:42.161
sent to me by classmates that said, I'll never wear 
this again. But over the years, they reclaimed

26:42.221 --> 26:47.648
their rings. You never lost yours. Yeah, I lost 
mine in a crawdad hole out here near the river in

26:49.209 --> 26:56.177
Brazos County. I knew what hole it was in. Never 
could find it. So it's still out there. I know where

27:02.364 --> 27:03.105
it is. I know where the crawdad hole was. And I 
bought a newer. What about, have you had any good

27:09.991 --> 27:15.880
ring stories of where somebody somewhere far away 
recognized? We've had several rings that we have

27:16.641 --> 27:28.519
tracked down the 59er that have come in to the 
association office.

27:29.900 --> 27:44.775
Kathy Dockwaller, who was on the staff over the 
association for years, always was helpful in

27:29.900 --> 27:44.775
running down the owners of those rings. And that 
was always an interesting experience, took

27:46.757 --> 27:55.806
considerable time, and surprisingly some of them 
didn't want their rings back. Yeah.

28:00.359 --> 28:29.607
your senior year what were your feelings when you 
did that final review

28:00.359 --> 28:29.607
just I was relieved that it was over with because I I 
knew what I was going to do at that time I was

28:00.359 --> 28:29.607
entering graduate school had a job so final review 
was

28:31.949 --> 28:40.201
A fun experience, but at the same time was not one 
that left an indelible mark on me. I remember it was

28:40.822 --> 28:44.487
so hot out there and several people passed out. I 
can remember that from being out of tension for a

28:44.547 --> 28:52.159
considerable period of time. Now, who came for 
commencement and final review? Generally

28:55.540 --> 28:57.223
parents. We had quite a few parents that would come 
in for final review. And did anybody, by then, are

29:01.070 --> 29:05.197
you married by then? No. Didn't get married until a 
month later after graduating. But she, was she

29:10.506 --> 29:11.708
here? Yes. For? Yeah. Janiece came over for final 
review. And who, commencement, describe

29:16.056 --> 29:19.422
commencement in your day.

29:22.270 --> 29:26.736
Trying to think who spoke, it was in G. Raleigh.

29:29.480 --> 29:41.296
We received our diplomas by marching across the 
stage, I suspect very similar as today, but

29:29.480 --> 29:41.296
everybody graduated with one service. We didn't 
have multiple services required. Every name was

29:45.341 --> 29:48.346
called, every hand shaken. Yes. Roger Fellman did 
it, and he did it. I don't know. He's probably not

29:52.874 --> 30:04.605
doing it today, but here just a few years ago, Roger 
was still one of those who read off the names and

29:52.874 --> 30:04.605
pronounced them as they came across the stage. And 
there was no monkey business? No. We didn't

30:08.930 --> 30:12.253
celebrate on stage. As you were preparing to go out 
into life how did well prepared did you feel A&M had

30:17.114 --> 30:22.862
made you for the real world? I was confident that I 
could handle that but I had also made the decision

30:24.905 --> 30:45.113
that if I was going to ever go anywhere in 
entomology that I had to get a PhD so I started that

30:24.905 --> 30:45.113
even though I had a job I took made plans initially 
to take time off to go back and get my masters and

30:45.751 --> 30:56.142
ultimately a Ph.D. but that was just a start. I 
recognized that in this profession to do what I

30:56.422 --> 31:12.919
wanted to do that you had to have a Ph.D. Now it 
wasn't required at that time for an area extension

30:56.422 --> 31:12.919
entomologist but by 65 it was. Alright as you look 
back Were there some life-changing events that

31:17.003 --> 31:20.888
occurred
