WEBVTT

00:01.448 --> 00:29.076
lived the majority of my life and in fact we've 
lived in the home I guess now about 20 years that

00:01.448 --> 00:29.076
across the street from us or it was across the road 
then from us was just flat land and then there was a

00:01.448 --> 00:29.076
creek and then there was pasture land all around 
and we go back and look now and schools have gone up

00:01.448 --> 00:29.076
there are houses everywhere and it's strictly a 
residential area rather than a being on the

00:29.900 --> 00:31.702
country as it was earlier. So Bryan has kind of come 
of age in your, since you've been alive more or

00:32.343 --> 00:37.428
less. Yeah, because I think it was from what I hear 
my mother tell and my grandmother tell, it was

00:38.329 --> 00:55.389
really fairly stagnant for quite a number of years 
and then just in my lifetime has it really grown and

00:38.329 --> 00:55.389
become a city as such rather than just some bunking 
town. Okay, we've talked about your father's side

00:57.251 --> 00:59.333
of of the family at the first of this interview. 
What can you tell me about your mother's side, the

01:02.555 --> 01:04.778
Fosters?

01:07.521 --> 01:12.367
Well, my mother is a combination of Hopkins and 
Foster, my grandmother being a Hopkins. She's of

01:13.989 --> 01:15.591
Scotch-Irish descent. We still do have some 
distant relatives in Scotland and Ireland.

01:24.440 --> 01:33.510
My grandfather came here, my great-grandfather, 
I know, homesteaded on one side of the road in Steep

01:24.440 --> 01:33.510
Hollow. And his son, which is my grandfather, 
homesteaded across the road from him, where he

01:34.832 --> 01:40.658
still lives today. And we owned, or rather my 
relatives owned the majority of the community

01:40.678 --> 01:51.510
there and have sold off portions of land. through 
the years. My grandmother was from a small town

01:53.823 --> 01:59.433
called Cross that is just a short drive from here. 
There's nothing standing there except a few homes

01:59.473 --> 02:07.106
and a decrepit general store that is falling 
apart. Blink twice and you miss it. Right. I think

02:10.551 --> 02:13.055
I've been through there. You were talking about 
your brothers or your... Your father's brothers,

02:19.013 --> 02:24.541
whatever, selling off the patterns of land. This 
is on my mother's side, right. On your mother's

02:25.682 --> 02:26.664
side, right. Okay. Can you make a broad statement 
about the patterns of settlement in early Bryan

02:29.127 --> 02:34.335
College Station history? I think a lot of it had to 
do with you could raise cattle here. There was some

02:40.303 --> 02:42.486
cattle industry here. There was even more so the 
industry of cattle. call it industry as such, but

02:46.790 --> 03:00.523
the raising of cotton, the cotton mills that were 
here, this brought in a lot of black people used in

02:46.790 --> 03:00.523
the cotton, the picking of the cotton and 
everything. Not solely black, my mother picked

03:00.543 --> 03:03.526
cotton as a child also. Also, the railroad had 
quite a hand in bringing people to this area. In

03:14.275 --> 03:14.856
fact, the Some of the train tracks in Bryan have 
just recently been lifted. Right behind my dad's

03:19.440 --> 03:26.768
downtown store was where the old passenger train 
came through town. There was a depot there. And

03:28.690 --> 03:38.640
part of the land has since been bought up by my dad 
there in expansion of his facilities and then of

03:28.690 --> 03:38.640
the city there by the city hall in Bryan. What about 
the river, its effects, the Brazos River? Yes, the

03:42.393 --> 03:47.744
river provided excellent farmland, especially 
for the cotton growers. In fact, still today you

03:48.285 --> 03:58.044
can go down in what we call the bottom, and find just 
acres and acres of cotton growing. You mentioned

03:58.565 --> 04:03.034
something about the blacks picking cotton. We 
talked about this also earlier with the school

04:03.301 --> 04:06.345
integration. Has there been very much 
discrimination toward blacks? How would you

04:11.792 --> 04:20.103
describe their situation in the scheme of Bryan 
College Station history? Okay, just looking at my

04:20.143 --> 04:31.097
family, I can look at three generations right away 
and tell you I think the cotton industry did have a

04:20.143 --> 04:31.097
great deal to do with the black settling in this 
area. Once again, we are in the South, so therefore

04:31.904 --> 04:44.439
it has been in the past a more or less prejudiced 
area against the black-white relationship. Like

04:44.459 --> 04:59.937
my grandparents today, through no fault of their 
own, but merely through the socialization

04:44.459 --> 04:59.937
process that they went through as children and as 
young adults and on through their lives, still

04:44.459 --> 04:59.937
refer to the blacks as neighbors. really don't 
care to have blacks associate with them except in

05:00.490 --> 05:06.860
the capacity of hired hands. Then you step up to my 
parents who are not quite so strong in their

05:09.043 --> 05:16.094
feeling. They're not necessarily niggers, but 
they're colored people. It's a change in

05:19.599 --> 05:22.824
terminology there. They do accept somewhat the 
black people as human beings, I guess you could put

05:29.380 --> 05:34.266
it, even though they have been all the way through 
the ages. Rather than property. Right.

05:39.372 --> 05:56.293
But still, we have been brought up, my brothers and 
I have been brought up very definitely that there

05:39.372 --> 05:56.293
is to be a race separation insofar as socializing 
with, you know, like dating a black or something

05:39.372 --> 05:56.293
like that. And then you come to my generation where 
I have... been with and worked with black

05:59.755 --> 06:01.678
students. Not so much in public school because I 
never went to an integrated school. And then here

06:07.726 --> 06:14.435
at A&M I guess the black population has never been 
one that has been very high. But still it's a more

06:15.075 --> 06:23.647
liberal attitude that I possess and our brothers 
possess. They being younger than me have gone to

06:23.667 --> 06:27.552
school with blacks. I think in comparing my 
grandparents to myself, a lot of the prejudice has

06:28.578 --> 06:41.234
been lost, but yet some still remains, especially 
in the community. You have to take every person as

06:41.334 --> 06:43.997
an individual.

06:48.603 --> 06:49.064
Let's see. You were born in this area. What 
hospital were you born in? St. Joseph, but not the

06:54.711 --> 06:56.813
one that you see today. I was going to say, I was 
wondering. The St. Joseph that I was born in was

06:58.784 --> 07:03.410
over on 28th Street. It's now the Brazos Valley 
Mental Rehabilitation Unit. Somehow

07:07.956 --> 07:09.297
appropriate. Yes, I guess the building got the 
word that I was born there, so they had to change it

07:09.538 --> 07:15.145
over to be appropriate.

07:19.610 --> 07:21.152
There were hospital facilities there. It was the 
Catholic Hospital on 28th Street with St. Joseph.

07:25.565 --> 07:32.776
And then there was the Bryan Hospital, which was 
more or less in downtown Bryan. It still stands

07:32.796 --> 07:36.542
today, but I don't know what facilities are in it 
now. Just recently, in the last few years, has

07:38.465 --> 07:48.420
Bryan realized, I guess with the growth of the 
city, they've realized the need for more or less a

07:38.465 --> 07:48.420
medical complex. And there's been an area that has 
been developed off Villa Maria and 29th Street.

07:54.775 --> 07:55.376
The present. Yes, there's the present. St. Joe and 
Bryan Hospital and just a whole medical complex

07:57.339 --> 08:01.285
out there. What about, oh, you mentioned that some 
of your descendants were, your predecessors

08:03.068 --> 08:11.401
rather, were involved in law enforcement.

08:12.843 --> 08:15.788
Can you mention anything in particular about law 
enforcement? In the Bryan College Station area, I

08:17.450 --> 08:22.538
mean, we had the famous, renowned campus police 
and the, the always efficient college station

08:23.412 --> 08:30.499
police, have they always been, have they always 
had the reputation they have now? I'll put it that

08:30.519 --> 08:31.380
way. You know, it's amazing. It's so funny for me to 
reflect back, because, yeah, we had the same

08:34.382 --> 08:41.789
feelings about them, as far as I can remember. And 
it's amazing to me now, people always say, you

08:42.510 --> 08:47.855
know, how weird the people were. And it seems like 
to me, the... kids that I went to school with that

08:51.205 --> 08:59.977
were the biggest tail raisers are now on both the 
Bryan College Station and campus police force

08:51.205 --> 08:59.977
carrying real guns and real bullets. But in 
talking to them recently they seem to have matured

09:02.360 --> 09:12.353
some and maybe they are doing their job pretty 
good. It's funny that you mention that. Just the

09:14.116 --> 09:19.063
other night, just for my own personal interest, I 
rode with the campus cops. I don't know if students

09:19.464 --> 09:26.495
know this, but you can ride with them at any time 
just to see what the KKs do. And I was very fortunate

09:26.555 --> 09:37.412
to ride with one of the sergeants who's been here 
for about 30 years, and I was asking him how has law

09:26.555 --> 09:37.412
enforcement changed on the campus here. And 
believe it or not, since we've gone

09:37.713 --> 09:51.814
co-educational, we've become a much milder 
campus and have had less carryings on, as you would

09:37.713 --> 09:51.814
say, or less, you know, really bad stuff go on. I was 
asking about the trends that have changed. And

09:54.938 --> 10:00.446
just in his time, he can remember, like now, CBs are 
the things that are really getting ripped off. And

10:00.707 --> 10:02.750
when he first came here, it was hubcaps. Hubcaps. 
Another... thing I think that's worth noting is

10:06.738 --> 10:27.945
Chief Luther, who is chief of the KK's now, was with 
the Texas Rangers for about 20 years and then he was

10:06.738 --> 10:27.945
with the Texas Highway Department after that and 
he has really made a lifelong career out of law

10:06.738 --> 10:27.945
enforcement in the state of Texas and I think he's a 
very admirable man.

10:30.789 --> 10:32.491
Okay, let's get back to the community. What about 
folklore in the local area you know any kind of old

10:34.042 --> 11:02.378
ghost stories or anything like that circulating 
about this area you brought that up when I did my

10:34.042 --> 11:02.378
student teaching in Bryan High School I had my 
students bring in stories that they believed or

10:34.042 --> 11:02.378
legends as such that they've heard in this area and 
it was quite amazing the various stories that the

10:34.042 --> 11:02.378
kids brought in One story that I had a 10th grade 
student that would vow this was so true. You can go

11:10.641 --> 11:18.572
to Boonville Cemetery, which is a very old 
cemetery out on Boonville Road off of Villa Maria,

11:10.641 --> 11:18.572
at the end of Villa Maria. It's in North Glion, 
northeast Glion. And you can go and part between

11:23.319 --> 11:31.150
two certain trees and honk your horn three times. 
and you're supposed to be able to see green,

11:31.535 --> 11:39.244
glassy, fiery eyes staring into your windshield 
if you look close enough. And she swears about

11:39.264 --> 11:40.486
this. Yeah, somehow she was out there on a Friday or 
Saturday night, and she and the young man she was

11:40.766 --> 11:51.799
with happened to honk the horn three times and saw 
the eyes out there. Then, let's see, there was

11:53.021 --> 11:59.128
closer in College Station here off... right 
outside the campus, back in the Northgate area,

12:00.408 --> 12:09.062
there was the old haunted dorm, which has been 
gradually... I live in one of those. Which has

12:10.384 --> 12:14.170
gradually been detained through the years. 
Excuse me. Then there is also the story there's

12:16.914 --> 12:27.411
supposed to be a home here in College Station where 
after World War II, when there was a huge... put of

12:28.083 --> 12:38.398
students into A&M, veterans coming back to 
school, a lot of people in the community were

12:28.083 --> 12:38.398
called upon to open up their homes to help house 
students. And one particular family opened up

12:38.418 --> 12:41.262
their attic. Although it wasn't a very large 
space, they opened up their attic to allow

12:41.782 --> 12:47.931
students to lived there, and a couple of young men 
were supposedly to have lived there. And if you're

12:52.917 --> 13:05.828
familiar with the tradition of pulling an 
all-nighter before exams, one of these students

12:52.917 --> 13:05.828
was supposed to have walked the floor, pacing back 
and forth, studying for his various tests and

12:52.917 --> 13:05.828
exams. And the student was killed before he 
graduated from A&M. And it is still said today that

13:10.832 --> 13:17.378
at various times, especially during the season 
where final exams would be being held. You can hear

13:19.671 --> 13:33.934
this Aggie walking the floor in this particular 
home and in fact several families have complained

13:19.671 --> 13:33.934
of this and moved out of the house and I've talked 
with them and they do swear. I've never heard it.

13:34.976 --> 13:39.683
I've never had an occasion to be in the house 
overnight during that particular time of the

13:34.976 --> 13:39.683
year. Huh. That's really strange. Do you know 
where this house is exactly? I've been there, but I

13:45.438 --> 13:48.442
can't tell you exactly where it is now. I was taken 
there, and so I don't remember how to get there. You

13:52.047 --> 13:56.232
mentioned that people threw open their homes to 
A&M students. Do you find that this community

13:56.252 --> 14:02.761
seems to pull together in crisis situations such 
as that? People seem to be pretty friendly.

14:07.004 --> 14:13.231
I think it's a basically friendly community and 
one that will help other people out. However, it

14:13.491 --> 14:23.562
has grown very much less so in the recent years back 
when it was a smaller town and everybody knew

14:13.491 --> 14:23.562
everybody. I can remember that. In fact, today a 
great majority of the people I still know, but we

14:25.945 --> 14:31.611
have had So many new people move in whether they've 
been connected with industry or with the

14:32.401 --> 14:37.468
university. So that now, like even I heard just 
yesterday on the radio, one of the disc jockeys was

14:38.430 --> 14:49.205
driving down the street and happened to see a woman 
who had fallen. And she hadn't moved in quite a

14:49.706 --> 14:51.969
while. And there seemed to be no effort of her to 
stand up. And she had fallen along Texas Avenue and

14:54.914 --> 14:58.619
twisted her ankle. And no one had stopped to help 
her. I think it was 670, maybe another street. So I

15:06.738 --> 15:15.626
think right there, that's a sign that maybe people 
don't stop and take the time to be as friendly as

15:06.738 --> 15:15.626
they should be. However, in traveling all over the 
states, I do prefer the South as a whole to having

15:15.726 --> 15:24.774
friendly or more congenial people. I wish the 
campus would go back to its traditional howdy.

15:29.899 --> 15:30.319
Yes. Because that helped... spread 
congeniality. I think that's only recently died,

15:36.458 --> 15:39.122
too. I'd say this year. I mean, it has been dying, 
I'll admit, but I know at least half of the student

15:40.965 --> 15:54.686
body, you know, including the core, used to do the 
old Howdy tradition. I know all the people on the

15:54.726 --> 16:00.795
streets in Bryan are pretty much that way, too, but 
this year it just seems like... You know, just wow,

16:01.805 --> 16:04.569
nothing. Well, especially being our centennial 
year, I hate to think that one of our more famous

16:04.589 --> 16:09.617
traditions has died. And I hope that people will, I 
know I hear complaints that somebody's, you know,

16:10.939 --> 16:20.935
really in a crummy mood and they walk to class and 
they hear this stereo howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy,

16:10.939 --> 16:20.935
howdy every time they turn around. But yet, I 
really don't think people mean it as just a tape

16:21.416 --> 16:27.525
recording of saying howdy every time they turn 
around. meet somebody, just a pleasant smile,

16:27.978 --> 16:30.922
even if they don't speak. But I would like to see 
that one tradition revived. And I don't think it's

16:33.225 --> 16:35.808
dead completely. I think it's dying, but I'd like 
to see it revived. Let's talk about the community

16:39.754 --> 16:42.757
again. What is the social life like in Bryan? What 
do people in Bryan do for a good time? What have they

16:48.365 --> 16:56.095
done historically, back from the good old days 
with the Sunday

16:48.365 --> 16:56.095
go-to-meet-and-dinner-on-the-grounds type 
thing? How has that evolved? We had a lot of that. It

17:01.033 --> 17:07.883
was a very strong,

17:01.033 --> 17:07.883
I think it had a very strong religious founding. 
And there has been a lot of social life that has

17:09.425 --> 17:19.599
generated around the church and the youth 
activities from that. However, in recent years,

17:20.120 --> 17:26.689
people have grown out of that to a certain extent. 
which I hesitate to say whether that's been good or

17:27.023 --> 17:31.409
bad.

17:35.215 --> 17:41.244
I know when I was growing up, I felt like the only 
place to go was either to the show or to the show or to

17:35.215 --> 17:41.244
the show.

17:43.547 --> 17:45.369
How about places like Pooh's Park? Did that appeal 
to you? Was that around then? Did they have

17:51.018 --> 17:52.660
anything like that? Now we had the miniature golf 
course in the parks. That was about it as far as

17:58.174 --> 18:07.165
extracurricular activities for a child growing 
up. I think now the community is seeing a need for

18:07.185 --> 18:16.117
having facilities for children as such. In fact, 
you might directly tie that into the drug scare

18:17.458 --> 18:23.406
that we had. recent years where all of the 
quote-unquote establishment felt like the

18:23.757 --> 18:34.646
younger generation was going to the dogs and maybe 
they realized that there wasn't enough to do in

18:23.757 --> 18:34.646
some areas for their children. And that's why a lot 
of people have gone to seeking out and providing

18:35.427 --> 18:43.194
recreation for the various age groups. Yes, I want 
to get on a little bit of the religion. You said that

18:49.459 --> 18:52.702
it was basically a pretty religious area early. 
What kind of religions were available to people

18:54.470 --> 19:00.259
here in College Station?

19:01.321 --> 19:04.426
Once again, I'm more familiar with the Bryan area 
rather than College Station. Oh, well, fine.

19:06.089 --> 19:16.766
There is, of course, always been your Southern 
Baptists who have been a very strong group in the

19:06.089 --> 19:16.766
South as a whole. Your Methodist is another very 
strong church. And then I suppose to the Spanish

19:21.689 --> 19:32.980
and Italian descent, we've also had a very strong 
Catholic influence on our area. Then, of course,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.461
you have your other religions. I hate to be leaving 
out religion, but I think those are really the main

19:34.642 --> 19:46.914
three that have been the largest and the most 
functional in this area. Can you think of anything

19:48.555 --> 19:51.358
else, unusual stories? Anything you might add? 
No. I really can't. The community has really

20:00.662 --> 20:02.604
changed. As I remember, and I know in our mothers' 
and grandparents' memories, it has really

20:04.186 --> 20:11.774
changed. For the better? I don't know. There's a 
certain neatness about a small town. but yet there

20:22.068 --> 20:28.816
seems to be more social life, especially for a 
young person in a larger town. I think this is still

20:30.498 --> 20:44.534
a nice-sized town to raise a family

20:30.498 --> 20:44.534
in, but it needs to have a lot more to offer, 
especially with this being such a

20:30.498 --> 20:44.534
college-oriented community. I know the one thing 
that has really... I know we're not supposed to

20:48.559 --> 20:51.282
really get on the college, but One thing that has 
really changed is, like, A&M itself and the fact

20:51.667 --> 20:59.674
that, like, everyone used to be all core. And I can 
remember walking down the street, you know,

21:00.475 --> 21:14.488
Saturday afternoon or whatever, and you could see 
a guy just, you know, dressed in civilian clothes

21:00.475 --> 21:14.488
with his head just as bald as a billiard ball and 
just a spit shine on it. And you knew immediately he

21:14.648 --> 21:16.690
was a freshman in the corps. He didn't have to be in 
uniform to tell that. And it's now they all have

21:19.578 --> 21:28.249
hair and now they're not all necessarily in 
uniform on campus. And then with the women going

21:29.211 --> 21:35.799
into the Corps it still startles me to see women. 
And now that we've got two juniors I'm

21:35.839 --> 21:41.687
anticipating to see what they'll look like in 
boots next year. and see exactly what kind of, you

21:42.241 --> 21:57.476
know, will they wear the gaucho pants with boots, 
or are they going to wear the boot pants with boots,

21:42.241 --> 21:57.476
or exactly what they will look like. I'm glad we've 
stopped shaving heads. I don't think the girls

21:59.137 --> 22:01.099
would really go in for that. If the school were to, 
say, were to mystically go bankrupt tomorrow, If

22:09.140 --> 22:13.768
they had to shut A&M down, Federal Education Act or 
something, shut A&M down. State. State. Okay, do

22:16.732 --> 22:22.201
you think that the Bryan College Station would 
survive? At the same age I am now, if you'd asked me

22:24.365 --> 22:34.742
that 10 or 15 years ago, I would say that the whole 
town would probably just be wiped out. or it would

22:35.077 --> 22:40.583
just be a town like Hearn or Navasota, you know, 
just a small community. The university gives so

22:43.046 --> 22:48.892
much

22:43.046 --> 22:48.892
to the area. However, I think we've got enough now, 
speaking industry-wise and business-wise, that

22:49.773 --> 23:02.046
they would survive as a town and probably a 
nice-sized town. However, of course, your, like,

23:03.072 --> 23:14.823
weaker eating establishments and things like 
this may find themselves looking for more

23:03.072 --> 23:14.823
customers and close down. In fact, very much so. 
But I think it would survive to a certain extent. It

23:20.489 --> 23:25.173
wouldn't be near the area that it is now, but there 
would be something. Well, and because people have

23:25.634 --> 23:28.877
their roots here, too. For one reason, we stayed 
around here. I don't know what that reason is right

23:31.549 --> 23:34.694
now. For some unknown reason, my dad decided to 
come here. He's made it very good here. He's

23:41.846 --> 23:45.572
decided to stay and has had no desire to leave. I 
have a feeling there are many other people, even if

23:45.632 --> 23:56.670
the university was to dissipate somehow during 
the night, that they would too choose to stay here.

23:58.405 --> 23:59.532
Well, that's all I have. Do you want to add 
anything? No, I can't think of anything. I really

24:02.975 --> 24:03.780
enjoyed it. Thank you for your time.
