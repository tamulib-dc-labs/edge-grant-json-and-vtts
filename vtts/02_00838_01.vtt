00:01.280 --> 00:03.403
I am John M. Lawrence, Jr. I was born here in Brown in 
October 1899 in a house located at West 16th and

00:04.244 --> 00:16.359
Parker Street. In 1907, my parents moved to

00:26.288 --> 00:36.577
East 26th and Texas Avenue, where they erected a 
two-story frame colonial home. I lived there

00:36.597 --> 00:39.380
until maturity. I have lived in Brown all of my life 
and have been engaged in various activities. My

00:50.970 --> 00:54.253
first occupation was shipping clerk for a 
wholesale grocery company. Then I went into a

00:58.099 --> 01:15.550
combination automobile dealership garage and 
service station in 1923,

00:58.099 --> 01:15.550
which I operated until 1931.

01:18.685 --> 01:37.288
At that time, I became book agent for a minor heart 
company and also worked part-time as an appraiser

01:18.685 --> 01:37.288
or inspector for the Regional Agricultural 
Credit Corporation. Mr. Lawrence, do you

01:37.308 --> 01:42.255
remember the name of the wholesale grocery that 
you worked for? Yeah, Lawrence. Lawrence. OK,

01:46.220 --> 01:46.400
fine. Lawrence.

01:51.035 --> 02:05.075
On June 1st,

01:51.035 --> 02:05.075
1933, I became a cashier of the City National Bank. 
My first banking experience, I became chief loan

02:05.156 --> 02:20.518
officer on the third day of my association with the 
bank and continued in that capacity for 27 years,

02:21.528 --> 02:30.557
the last 17 of which I was president of the bank. 
Since 1960,

02:32.179 --> 02:38.926
I have been retired.

02:41.509 --> 02:49.577
And at present, my only business connection is a 
director of Brown Building and Loan Association.

02:51.194 --> 02:52.075
Thank you, Mr. Lawrence. Could you tell us perhaps 
a little about your parents, where they were born

02:52.095 --> 03:01.268
and how they came to Bryan? My father was born 10 
miles north of Bryan in the Alexander community in

03:01.289 --> 03:10.061
1873.

03:13.626 --> 03:21.117
After receiving about three and a half years of 
formal education, He moved to Brown at about age 10

03:23.105 --> 03:31.734
and lived here the remainder of his life. My mother 
was born in Brown across the street from the First

03:31.754 --> 03:38.542
United Methodist Church. As a small child, she 
moved to another house just south of the

03:39.763 --> 03:52.757
courthouse on East 26th at Washington. And she 
lived in the shadow of the courthouse practically

03:54.307 --> 03:59.475
all the rest of her life. My father died at age 64, 
but my mother lived to be 95 years and seven months.

04:10.892 --> 04:12.955
Do you remember when your mother was born? 
February 17th, 1874. 1874.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.609
You're younger than your father. Younger than my 
father.

04:31.443 --> 04:33.246
Your father came here at a young age. Do you know or 
did he ever tell you what attracted him to Bryan?

04:37.391 --> 04:51.791
Well, his father had been a farmer and stockman, 
but he moved to Bryan and set up a lumber company.

04:51.811 --> 04:53.153
Was that named Lawrence also? It was, but at his 
death, he left the business to his daughter, who

04:53.656 --> 05:03.885
had married him, Mr. Parker. From then on, it was 
known as Parker. I

05:06.247 --> 05:09.870
see. Did you remember your grandfather at all? No, 
I didn't. I never knew either of my grandparents. I

05:19.159 --> 05:22.181
didn't know my paternal grandmother. I did know 
them. My maternal grandmother. My husband was

05:26.596 --> 05:28.838
dead. I never saw him. Do you know anything about 
her, the maternal grandmother? Yes, she was a

05:36.046 --> 05:39.549
native of Bryan, too. And she was a Miss Hall, the 
daughter of old Dr. Hall, who was the only doctor in

05:40.030 --> 05:52.283
Bryan. For a good many years.

06:01.705 --> 06:02.707
Well, that's interesting. I guess perhaps you 
could tell us just a little bit about your life. How

06:09.179 --> 06:14.389
you saw Brian grow and what you think is 
significant about it. Well, in my first

06:15.820 --> 06:31.019
recollection, Brown was a town of some 875 people, 
about half of whom were black.

06:34.223 --> 06:45.658
Brown, the first growth of Brown, real growth, 
came in 1913 when the federal government created

06:34.223 --> 06:45.658
the extension service and named Texas A&M as 
headquarters for Texas. That brought about 75

06:51.924 --> 06:58.250
families into Brazos County.

07:01.753 --> 07:06.878
A&M provided a house for the director. The other 74 
families had to do the best they can, and most of

07:06.898 --> 07:15.105
them came into Brown. And they rented everything 
available. But that stimulated a little

07:20.115 --> 07:25.483
building, quite a bit of building for a town of that 
size. Because by that time, I imagine Brown was a

07:26.244 --> 07:34.817
town of maybe 1,800 to 2,000 people.

07:38.923 --> 07:43.270
That was the first real

07:45.005 --> 07:48.509
economic thrust, I suppose you'd call it. Well, 
back in those early recollections, who would you

07:48.529 --> 08:05.230
say were the controlling families in Bryan, or the 
socially... besides your own, I'm sure, your

07:48.529 --> 08:05.230
father... Well, there were two factions in the 
town, as you might expect. One was known as the

08:06.732 --> 08:10.977
Parker-Haston faction. That was... my father's 
brother-in-law who operated the lumberyard and

08:14.857 --> 08:43.767
also was president of the city national bank and 
the astons were a big plantation owners razzles

08:14.857 --> 08:43.767
bottom but they headquartered in brown and the two 
of them were those two families were associated

08:14.857 --> 08:43.767
together the other family was headed by old Dr. 
J.W. Howell.

09:00.624 --> 09:04.027
Do you remember anything about the Howell family? 
Yes, he had three sons, and with them he controlled

09:04.048 --> 09:13.939
a bank, lumberyard cotton compressed and 
acquired a substantial acreage in the brazos

09:14.797 --> 09:42.897
bottom so he was in direct conflict with that 
parker hasson faction and because he controlled

09:14.797 --> 09:42.897
the warehouse and cotton the cotton warehouse and 
compressed And those people did not want to

09:44.193 --> 09:48.137
patronize him. They organized another 
compression lab and set it up near where I was born.

10:03.052 --> 10:05.915
I think you'd mentioned your father had been a 
rancher. Was that right? Or was he in the cotton

10:06.655 --> 10:07.716
business? Grandfather. Or grandfather, pardon 
me. He was a farmer in Maryland, but he also had

10:09.775 --> 10:21.907
livestock, more sheep than cattle. Did your 
father ever say anything about what kind of crops

10:21.927 --> 10:26.772
he grew in those days? Cotton was the main thing. It 
was a cash crop, and corn was to feed his mules and

10:30.976 --> 10:39.765
livestock. That was before the day of the grain 
salt. There was no maize or anything like that. Of

10:48.740 --> 10:59.673
course, hay, but...

10:48.740 --> 10:59.673
Rolling right along. Cotton was his cash crop. How 
about... I imagine he had a family.

11:11.690 --> 11:18.299
plot up close to the home where they grew their own 
vegetables, things of that sort that they wanted

11:11.690 --> 11:18.299
to do? Well, actually,

11:18.319 --> 11:29.794
this is a surprise, but those early Texans didn't 
bother with the garden. They ate meat and bread and

11:31.436 --> 11:40.127
bought little things along from the grocery 
store, but they didn't need much. I see. Lots of

11:42.701 --> 11:46.185
them didn't even keep a milk cup. Both condensed 
milk. So I guess the, do you think the diet has

11:50.310 --> 11:54.595
changed any? Your grandfather and your father, 
what they ate as they grew up as opposed to what you

11:55.256 --> 12:00.743
grew up? I guess you had more and different foods. 
Well, when I was a child, we had beefsteak for

12:02.325 --> 12:05.929
breakfast. And we continued that, I guess, until I 
was 12 or 14 years old. And then we switched to bacon

12:15.069 --> 12:22.157
and eggs, things like that. But was beefsteak 
fairly common for most of the families, do you

12:22.177 --> 12:26.282
think, at that time? That was the usual diet. 
That's the usual diet. And they had what they

12:30.187 --> 12:35.393
called meat markets. Lots of the husbands would go 
down before breakfast, buy meat, stop by the

12:36.976 --> 12:52.593
saloon, have a drink or two, and then come home and 
the wives would cook breakfast. Well, were there

12:52.613 --> 12:55.916
very many saloons here in those days? There were 13 
on Main Street. 13 on Main Street. They all did

13:00.101 --> 13:01.202
pretty good business? All of them got rich. All of 
them got rich. I noticed some while back, reading a

13:07.958 --> 13:21.092
little bit about Brian, that one of the first 
jails, perhaps it was a county jail, was stuck up

13:07.958 --> 13:21.092
into a tree, I think 20 feet or something above it. 
Do you ever heard anything about that? Well, that

13:24.616 --> 13:27.919
wasn't an actual jail. That was what they used to 
punish obstreperous prisoners. put them up there

13:36.865 --> 13:41.890
and leave them out there in the weather. I see. 
Maybe three or four days, sometimes in the dead of

13:43.211 --> 13:49.977
winter, sometimes in the hot summer. Rain, sleet, 
whatever. Usually when they came out of there,

13:54.542 --> 13:58.085
they wasn't behaving. But the first jail I 
remember

13:58.906 --> 14:04.611
was on the grounds where the president's 
courthouse is. I guess that would be the northwest

14:08.889 --> 14:12.072
corner. That was the first jail I remember. But 
they had the trees there that they put the

14:15.956 --> 14:24.784
obstreperous prisoners in, as I call them. And of 
course, at that time, I lived just across the

14:25.225 --> 14:31.711
street. And we used to go over there. look at them.

14:39.505 --> 14:48.016
Well, you lived pretty close to

14:39.505 --> 14:48.016
Miss Carnes, Miss Donut, as they call her. Yes, we 
lived as well. The families knew each other. Oh,

14:51.180 --> 14:52.662
yes. They were one of the wealthiest families in 
the county. He operated a lady's store, old man,

15:03.350 --> 15:06.957
J.W. Coates. And then his son took it over. He was 
W.J. Coates. They were a bunch of initials. He

15:19.423 --> 15:21.527
operated that store a long time. They also brought 
quite a bit of acreage in the grass and spotted it.

15:30.374 --> 15:38.327
People of large means, as is evident. Her husband 
was a publisher of the Brown Daily Eagle when he

15:38.347 --> 15:48.223
died as a young man.

15:49.807 --> 15:55.695
You never remember.

15:56.035 --> 15:58.398
Of course, they left just one block from us.

16:01.902 --> 16:06.368
Those youngsters, you talked a little earlier 
about playing football around here. Just

16:07.710 --> 16:08.791
neighborhood. Just neighborhood. There 
probably wasn't any organized football, was

16:10.053 --> 16:13.838
there, or not much? They had two teams in. They 
had... Eastern Tigers and

16:19.338 --> 16:28.489
Wildcats, they used to play all the time. They were 
grown men, what I call them, grown men. They were 18

16:34.477 --> 16:38.321
to 25, just local. Of course, they had organized 
football in A&M as far back as I can remember. And

16:46.732 --> 16:47.893
then... I guess along about 1910, they started 
football in high school.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.089
Where was this you played? And do you remember 
about when it was where you had this occasion where

17:03.350 --> 17:10.059
you were playing safety and moving backwards? I 
was in the dirt street between my house where we

17:10.079 --> 17:14.645
lived and the courthouse. And the courthouse. 
Yes, it was. on what is now Texas Avenue between

17:18.232 --> 17:24.438
25th and 26th Street. You see, we played on that 
street because the side streets, 25th and 26th, in

17:25.479 --> 17:37.111
those days, the grocery stores delivered 
groceries all over town. If we tried to play on one

17:37.952 --> 17:44.198
of those streets, why, those delivered wagons and 
interfered with our game. But they very seldom

17:45.780 --> 17:48.222
made that cost. Of course, there was no traffic 
because there was no automobile.

17:56.081 --> 18:01.848
At that time, there were five automobiles in the 
county. Do you remember hearing

18:01.888 --> 18:09.958
anything about the effect of the railroads here 
when it first came out? Well, that is what

18:10.478 --> 18:14.243
caused... The growth of Brown, the establishment 
of Brown in the first place. You see, Houston and

18:20.785 --> 18:26.415
Texas centrally was known then. Ran from 
Galveston to Houston. And then they extended it

18:33.166 --> 18:37.353
north to Hampton. And that was the terminus of the 
railroad. Then they extended it to this community

18:41.965 --> 18:46.430
of Milliken down here. But then they had a terrible 
epidemic of yellow fever down there and

18:48.152 --> 18:57.503
practically filled out the town. So the railroad 
extended it farther north to Brown and

18:57.523 --> 19:08.395
established the town. At that time, Boonville out 
here was the county seat of Brazos County. But when

19:16.095 --> 19:39.124
the railhead came to Brown and began to bring so 
much business here, you see people came to Brown

19:16.095 --> 19:39.124
from as far away as Texarkana, Shreveport, parts 
of Oklahoma.

19:39.442 --> 19:44.088
We had a big wagon yard here. They'd come in here and 
load that freight and then

19:44.108 --> 19:53.158
wagon it back to the home. They also brought the 
cotton and whatever hides, things like that to

19:53.959 --> 20:08.757
Brown, loaded them on the railroad, shipped them 
to Galveston. I noticed, of course, the railroad

20:09.496 --> 20:16.405
tracks, the spur anyway, this goes right down 
behind the old stores. It's pretty handy for the

20:16.645 --> 20:17.987
merchants. Well, that was the reason they located 
Main Street where it was because the merchants

20:20.531 --> 20:38.254
could part on Main and their backs would lead to the 
railroad and they could unload from the train on a

20:20.531 --> 20:38.254
boxcar because they'd have a spud, and they'd send 
the boxcars back to the separate stores and load

20:38.470 --> 20:48.464
direct to save a double-handle. And that's the 
reason they're located on Main Street. And then

20:55.875 --> 21:02.425
behind the end came the International in Great 
Northern. It also came from Houston, it came to

21:02.565 --> 21:07.532
Brown, and they ran the down Brown Street. They 
went all the way to the oil mill, which was down, I

21:11.093 --> 21:22.709
guess, about 14th Street, out of town, past where I 
was born. There used to be a cotton oil mill, a

21:22.729 --> 21:29.839
cotton seed oil mill down there. The Howell 
Fraction owned it, too. Howell Fraction. Do you,

21:35.288 --> 21:48.025
back in your early recollections, of course your 
parents, understand, had the, had a

21:35.288 --> 21:48.025
wholesale grocery, is that right? Right here, my 
father organized that in 1912.

21:54.674 --> 22:03.726
He had a very career, like I told you, he only had 
about three and a half years of formal education,

21:54.674 --> 22:03.726
but he was a an avid reader, studied,

22:04.027 --> 22:15.939
and he was more or less on his own from the time he was 
about 12 years old. He

22:15.999 --> 22:29.072
delivered papers, organized paper routes, put in 
a shoeshine business and had a neighbor. I hadn't

22:29.879 --> 22:33.903
run it for me quite as much as a 12-year-old boy. And 
he went on to Paris with me. Then he and Mr. Morris

22:40.010 --> 22:51.822
formed a partnership and moved down to Steel Store 
in the Chrysler's Bottom. Then around to General

22:51.842 --> 22:55.706
Store, including a saloon. Then they moved to 
Brown. set up a retail grocery and a bottling

22:59.242 --> 23:05.690
company. Soft drinks? Soft drinks. 
Sarsaparilla, things like that. And then my

23:14.822 --> 23:24.554
father, of course, they were both 
under-financed, no money. My father Grandpa

23:27.457 --> 23:35.988
County Treasurer was re-elected and he moved the 
office from the courthouse down to his store. They

23:36.008 --> 23:46.722
had that retail grocery and of course the money 
from that office and the tide of the mobile

23:36.008 --> 23:46.722
especially through the panic of 1907. And then in 
1912 the

23:46.982 --> 23:56.434
owner of the building wanted to bring his nephew 
over here from England and set him up in the grocery

23:57.190 --> 24:13.590
business, so he refused to extend John M. Lawrence 
and Company's lease. So Mr. Moring went across the

24:14.932 --> 24:22.641
street and became manager of Parker-Aston 
Hardware Company. which was a newly organized

24:23.262 --> 24:40.057
business and my father started operating it and he 
continued in that business until his death in

24:23.262 --> 24:40.057
1938. I understand that when the courthouse was 
built that there's quite a bit of land speculation

24:42.299 --> 24:52.408
around there they thought the merchants would all 
try to build around the courthouse like we see in so

24:53.013 --> 24:57.238
many cities? Well, a few of them did, but because of 
the situation of the railroad, they never could

24:58.719 --> 25:08.070
overcome that.

25:12.115 --> 25:21.265
Most of the stores preferred to be down on the 
railroad for convenience and lower overhead as

25:12.115 --> 25:21.265
well. You don't recall whoever put their money 
into land speculation around the courthouse,

25:21.633 --> 25:32.306
whether they were upset about it or... No, I don't 
remember much about it. In fact, there never was

25:32.406 --> 25:42.538
much, but the telephone company was there just 
across. They're still in that same location. Of

25:44.740 --> 25:49.005
course, they're spread out, but that's a big 
office. That same thing. It was there when I was a

25:50.307 --> 25:51.488
boy. And then on that block, there was a general 
merchandise, largely a feed store, which later

25:52.312 --> 26:00.500
failed.

26:03.744 --> 26:11.291
There was a law

26:03.744 --> 26:11.291
office. The lady had a millinery store. And

26:14.454 --> 26:22.082
there was a tombstone factory or sale How about 
your education? Can you tell us a little bit about

26:31.114 --> 26:43.429
where you went to school and how long?

26:44.030 --> 26:47.073
I went to the public school here in Brown. I started 
on what was known as Westside. It's a boys' school

26:52.792 --> 26:54.614
now. It was a brand-new building. And I went there 
two years, and then I transferred over to the east

26:57.658 --> 27:09.633
side, where they had the entire school from first 
grade to year 11. And then at that time, you did not

27:11.816 --> 27:20.487
have to have a high school diploma to enter A&M. And 
I had enough credits to get in, so I entered A&M in

27:21.766 --> 27:29.819
1915, incidentally at the age of 15. That's quite 
an accomplishment. And I went to A&M three years,

27:34.185 --> 27:41.637
and now my husband's a major. They only had two 
schools at that time, agriculture and

27:41.657 --> 27:46.845
engineering. And then World War I broke out, and in 
1918 they lowered the draft age to 18 and also

27:48.175 --> 28:07.602
reduced the age required to hold a commission to 
18, so I entered the training camp. was

28:07.885 --> 28:12.550
commissioned as second lieutenant.

28:13.731 --> 28:17.515
I got out of the service on December the 22nd. And 
then January 1st, I enrolled at the University of

28:19.297 --> 28:29.007
Texas in business administration. And I went 
there two years, but I never did graduate anyway.

28:37.619 --> 28:40.242
high school, A&M, and university. Well, that's 
something to go that long in a university and not

28:40.262 --> 28:48.230
having graduated from high school. That's quite 
an achievement there in itself. Well, I didn't

28:50.953 --> 28:55.137
have to have an diploma in A&M. I built up enough 
credits to enter the university, but I lost so many

28:56.579 --> 29:06.529
in the transfer that I wasn't anything like them. 
Let

29:08.028 --> 29:15.186
me move the tape over to the other side. I think 
we've come close to the end. So we don't get

29:18.834 --> 29:19.877
interrupted.
