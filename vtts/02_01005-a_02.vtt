00:01.921 --> 00:20.242
It's quite a stressful condition to be in a 
situation where you're having your first child

00:01.921 --> 00:20.242
and you get there, of course, when there was also 
another woman, a young woman, that was in labor at

00:01.921 --> 00:20.242
the same time. And I didn't really understand all 
the things that were going on, but of course I

00:20.282 --> 00:31.675
wanted to see my wife get some attention. As it 
turns out, the doctor was running back and forth

00:32.110 --> 00:39.358
from one patient to another. And I guess I was 
sitting there with this young husband of the

00:39.378 --> 00:50.489
Indian girl who was also having a baby. And he came 
out and explained that they were having a very

00:51.390 --> 01:01.020
difficult time with her and they really didn't 
know if they were going to be able to save either the

01:01.372 --> 01:25.472
baby or the mother and of course for me this was 
almost like striking terror into the into the

01:01.372 --> 01:25.472
heart and but I calmed down and you know I realized 
that we were dealing with a very difficult

01:01.372 --> 01:25.472
situation and so the fact that Joy wasn't getting 
much attention, I realized that, you know, there

01:25.857 --> 01:33.130
was some very difficult things going on. As it 
turns out, she actually had the baby in her street

01:33.290 --> 01:48.017
clothes because, you know, there really wasn't 
time to do much other than just sort of react. It was

01:49.744 --> 01:57.052
almost like, I guess, in the United States that you 
have a baby in a taxi cab or something like that.

01:57.092 --> 02:05.642
They were certainly in the delivery room, but 
there was, I guess, very little electricity.

02:05.682 --> 02:16.654
Electricity was always sort of going off and on, 
and water was always going off and on, and so you can

02:05.682 --> 02:16.654
never guarantee that you're going to have really 
any of the critical things when you need them. And

02:21.698 --> 02:32.669
so it was rather primitive conditions to have our 
first child, but as it turns out, everything

02:21.698 --> 02:32.669
worked out. And did she have leave from the 
university, or did you all have to take turns

02:32.689 --> 02:39.516
taking care of the child? I guess the classes were 
already over, We were going to be replaced by new

02:44.275 --> 02:55.104
volunteers that were coming in to take over the 
next year's teaching classes. So basically what

02:55.905 --> 03:02.811
we were doing was kind of interacting with the new 
volunteers who were coming in. There would be a

03:02.871 --> 03:08.695
little bit of overlap until they started into 
their new program. And so we were just kind of into a

03:08.796 --> 03:14.080
handoff stage then.

03:15.038 --> 03:16.540
So I guess at that point. That's also summer 
vacation. Yeah, it was going into the summer

03:19.385 --> 03:22.069
vacation. And we would be, I guess, preparing to 
teach the high school kids again for the entrance

03:22.189 --> 03:37.334
exam type of work. Did you feel that you were 
helping the locals on a day-to-day basis? Well, I

03:42.005 --> 03:42.946
think so. There was always question whether they 
saw you that much differently from, you know, any

03:43.627 --> 03:52.396
university professor. As it turns out, the pay for 
university professors there was rather poor, and

03:53.758 --> 04:03.629
most of them had to have two jobs anyway. So, you 
know, you could say one or the other jobs was kind of

04:04.550 --> 04:11.117
secondary.

04:12.700 --> 04:28.079
So, they saw at least one person that was given 
full-time to the job, and maybe the other person

04:12.700 --> 04:28.079
had to hold down several jobs.

04:28.099 --> 04:35.147
But, I don't know, I think they were more curious 
about

04:36.292 --> 04:47.169
foreigners and they were always wanting to come 
and talk to you about other kinds of situations,

04:36.292 --> 04:47.169
mostly political ones. There's a lot of political 
activism in Latin American universities and so

04:48.691 --> 05:02.232
they like to get into a lot of political 
discussions and so they would certainly take the

05:02.566 --> 05:10.636
opportunity to draw you into discussions on 
various kinds of political issues.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.325
And once again, how many years did you 
participate, and what were they? From the years

05:18.485 --> 05:23.150
1964 to 1966.

05:24.772 --> 05:29.518
So each one of the Peace Corps assignments was 
generally two years. And we started in June. The

05:33.830 --> 05:47.266
first part of the assignment was actually a 
three-month period of training in the University

05:33.830 --> 05:47.266
of Washington in Seattle. So that's the reason 
why, even though we didn't get into the country

05:48.628 --> 05:56.417
until, say, August or September, that our Peace 
Corps two-year assignment actually ended in June

05:56.819 --> 06:09.116
because of the sort of three-month training 
period when you first start out. They try to gear it

06:09.437 --> 06:19.090
so that you get in country at the time just before 
the new classes are going to start. And that will

06:19.891 --> 06:26.320
end at the time that the second year's classes 
ends. How many other volunteers were stationed

06:28.510 --> 06:36.700
locally, or you know, that you could interact 
with? When I originally got into country, I was

06:36.720 --> 06:55.142
with three other Peace Corps volunteers, and we 
were all, we all started off living with the same

06:36.720 --> 06:55.142
Bolivian family, and then It wasn't too long after 
that that we all kind of split up and moved in with

06:55.493 --> 07:01.732
different families. So I think there was probably 
maybe seven or eight Peace Corps volunteers that

07:06.682 --> 07:21.562
were working in La Paz and then we would see other 
volunteers that were working up on the Altiplano

07:06.682 --> 07:21.562
occasionally when they came back in. There was a 
Peace Corps office in La Paz and so we saw a lot of the

07:21.623 --> 07:30.715
people when they would travel back in to the Peace 
Corps office. They may have some business to take

07:33.988 --> 07:38.455
care of in the office. Maybe they were trying to get 
some additional medical materials or they would

07:38.575 --> 07:54.219
just come back in for periodic debriefings and so 
forth. Maybe they also had to come in for physical

07:54.279 --> 07:57.985
exams. And so we did interact with some of the 
people out in the outlying areas.

08:06.538 --> 08:09.683
Did they come back? They were stationed in more 
isolated villages. Did they come back with any

08:12.807 --> 08:19.315
interesting stories about what they 
encountered? Well, some of them were up on the

08:19.335 --> 08:28.427
Altiplano living in very small Indian villages. 
These people would either be in public health or in

08:28.627 --> 08:34.156
community development. And we also had other 
Peace Corps volunteers that were in the jungles up

08:35.138 --> 08:51.546
in Rurinabaki and Ribera Alta and so forth, up in 
what they call the Alto Beni.

08:52.083 --> 09:11.081
Of course, there were a lot of sort of jungle 
stories that came back from there about their

08:52.083 --> 09:11.081
experiences with things like pythons and wild 
boars and all this sort of stuff.

09:11.101 --> 09:21.010
But they're just kind of quite challenging things 
that can happen. Okay, see you later. See you late

09:23.583 --> 09:24.864
tonight. Yeah. Bye. Bye. There was one situation 
where

09:25.906 --> 09:42.266
in the Altiplano, they drink this drink called 
corn beer, which is chicha. The way they brew it,

09:42.526 --> 09:48.313
you actually chew the corn mash, and then they let 
the saliva go into this bowl and then it starts to

09:48.783 --> 10:01.282
ferment and then it gradually turns into what they 
call this corn beer. And so some of the volunteers

10:02.323 --> 10:13.660
were at a party and they felt that it was going to be, 
if they didn't uh, drink this, uh, this chicha, you

10:14.230 --> 10:31.446
know, that, uh, they're probably gonna, uh, 
create some kind of an incident where they would,

10:14.230 --> 10:31.446
people would feel that, you know, they were, uh, 
you know, not taking advantage of all the good

10:14.230 --> 10:31.446
things that they were being offered. And, uh, so 
they decided to go ahead and taste it. It tasted

10:34.890 --> 10:37.512
pretty good. Uh, and later on when they were on a, a 
bus trip, uh, of course they, they got, uh, really

10:44.302 --> 11:13.431
some intestinal cramps and so they were looking 
for an opportunity when the bus stopped

10:44.302 --> 11:13.431
to relieve some of their pressure that they had and 
so they had to run off into the bushes and

10:44.302 --> 11:13.431
one of them had actually some accident with his 
bowels and And so he was trying to hang his shorts up

11:13.917 --> 11:23.505
on this little fence that were there and then 
before he realized what was going on. This pig,

11:26.068 --> 11:36.262
there were some pigs in the area and they actually 
came over and grabbed his shorts and ate the

11:26.068 --> 11:36.262
shorts. So, here he was kind of in a situation where 
he was going to have to make the rest of the trip

11:37.144 --> 11:43.813
without his undershorts. But, you know, he just 
kind of learned to roll with the punches.

11:53.118 --> 11:55.964
But there were all kinds of situations. Another 
instance where the difference in cultures and the

11:55.984 --> 12:12.696
way you have to do things was one of the Peace Corps 
volunteers that was living with another Bolivian

11:55.984 --> 12:12.696
family in La Paz. They were trying to explain to her 
how to heat the water in the bathtub. You fill the

12:17.481 --> 12:24.269
bathtub up, and then you put in this electrical 
resistor, which is called a raya flotante. And so

12:25.010 --> 12:30.357
she had this thing in there, and it was heating the 
water. And they failed to tell her never to stick

12:31.218 --> 12:42.413
her hand in or, you know, never to get into the water 
without first turning the, Raya Floatante off

12:42.680 --> 12:51.113
because you're actually electrifying the water 
and water is a tremendous conductor of

12:42.680 --> 12:51.113
electricity. Anyway, she was all prepared for her 
bath and just kind of stuck her finger into the

12:51.273 --> 13:10.763
water to see if the water was warm enough and if she 
could take the Raya Floatante out and of course she

12:51.273 --> 13:10.763
got a tremendous electrical shock and she was flew 
out of the bathroom and actually ran out into the

13:11.013 --> 13:20.862
house where the rest of the Bolivian family was. 
And here she is, naked. And of course, they had to

13:24.065 --> 13:28.089
calm her down. And they were, I guess, all very 
happy that she wasn't electrocuted. She was one of

13:32.333 --> 13:34.115
the volunteers. Yes, she was one of the 
volunteers. But you never realize all these kind

13:39.700 --> 13:44.084
things that we take for granted. A simple thing 
like a shower and sometimes how difficult it is to

13:44.104 --> 13:56.675
adjust to these sort of new conditions.

13:56.695 --> 13:59.438
I guess I'm going to double check this. Okay, my 
next question. You were mentioning about showers

14:03.201 --> 14:05.503
and things like that. What were your facilities 
like? Were your living quarters We actually had

14:10.025 --> 14:17.335
pretty nice quarters with the Bolivian families 
that we were living with. And then after we got

14:17.355 --> 14:26.206
married, then we had a little apartment that we 
took. And other than the fact that there was no hot

14:26.226 --> 14:38.142
water and that there was no central heating in 
order to say even read or prepare for your lesson

14:38.712 --> 15:07.723
plans, or if you wanted to read Time magazine in the 
evening, you had to basically have sweaters and

14:38.712 --> 15:07.723
jackets on in the house, and then because the 
electricity was probably going to go out, you also

14:38.712 --> 15:07.723
had to have a lot of candles and lanterns ready for 
the time when there was sort of a planned

15:08.092 --> 15:31.348
electrical brownout almost daily and also the 
water was generally turned off by say like eight

15:08.092 --> 15:31.348
o'clock in the evening and what they actually had 
to do is that they had real old plumbing systems and

15:08.092 --> 15:31.348
so the plumbing actually the sewage sort of was 
just backing up and sitting there during the

15:31.514 --> 16:00.492
daytime and so then there was one main conduit that 
they had to use to drain off all of the sewage so at

15:31.514 --> 16:00.492
about eight o'clock they would turn off the water 
and then open this main valve and then you know run

15:31.514 --> 16:00.492
all the sewage down through that and so you 
couldn't flush the toilet or anything like that

16:00.657 --> 16:09.566
any time after 8 o'clock in the evening. So that was 
always pretty tough.

16:15.571 --> 16:27.863
But things were like

16:15.571 --> 16:27.863
we had to

16:15.571 --> 16:27.863
make special accommodations for few things that 
you don't normally have. There were a lot of fleas

16:32.335 --> 16:40.925
in the apartment and we didn't realize, you know, 
we knew we were getting bit by something. And my

16:40.945 --> 16:51.977
wife, you know, she would always be complaining 
that there were things in the bed that were

16:40.945 --> 16:51.977
crawling on her. so I never, they weren't 
bothering me as much, and maybe I had sour blood or

16:52.447 --> 17:15.383
something, but she was being bitten by these 
fleas, and eventually, and of course it was very

16:52.447 --> 17:15.383
cold there, and so she had these black tights on 
that she was sleeping with, and she actually got

17:15.835 --> 17:22.543
one of the fleas trapped in this mesh of these 
tights that she had on. And that's when I first

17:23.505 --> 17:28.571
really believed that they were fleas there. So we 
had to dust the bed down with flea powder. And

17:32.957 --> 17:39.084
eventually, we were able to control that thing. 
Yeah, there certainly are some different kinds of

17:39.104 --> 17:44.391
challenges that you have.

17:47.408 --> 17:51.615
Did you feel that the locals appreciated your 
presence? And what groups did, what groups

17:51.876 --> 17:56.764
didn't? Well, certainly the blind girls 
appreciated all the attention that they got. I

18:04.738 --> 18:12.792
think the high school students from the Tupac 
Atari night school genuinely appreciated all the

18:13.042 --> 18:21.913
efforts that we made to try to prepare them for 
their entrance into college. Perhaps there was

18:22.474 --> 18:28.722
not as much general acceptance of the college 
students themselves. By the time you get into

18:28.802 --> 18:38.695
college, you get a little more jaded, and I think 
you can say that one class was really interesting

18:38.945 --> 18:52.861
or you felt that you got some new insights to things 
because they were taught in a different way than

18:38.945 --> 18:52.861
you were used to. So you can never really judge what 
kind of impact you're having on the people. But I

19:01.451 --> 19:03.653
think we also provided a lot of guidance and 
opportunities for some of the brighter students

19:04.021 --> 19:20.055
that were there to try to make it easier for them to 
find education in other countries or in the United

19:04.021 --> 19:20.055
States or find opportunities for them to pursue 
their own studies and maybe go on to graduate

19:20.356 --> 19:38.397
school and perhaps they wouldn't have thought of 
those kinds of angles in order to help finance

19:20.356 --> 19:38.397
their continued studies. And I'm sure, of course, 
those people were all very genuinely

19:38.498 --> 19:49.030
appreciative of the Peace Corps efforts. And of 
course, all the people that were working in public

19:49.516 --> 20:04.473
health and community development and actually 
making living conditions better for the locals.

20:04.653 --> 20:08.358
That's always something that is appreciated. But 
then there were always the feeling that, and

20:08.378 --> 20:17.228
particularly in countries like Bolivia, where 
they had just had a revolution, They always were

20:17.427 --> 20:32.061
very suspicious of Peace Corps volunteers and 
bringing in outside and foreign ideas because

20:17.427 --> 20:32.061
they kind of felt that it was sowing seeds of 
continuous revolution. If you teach the Indians a

20:33.182 --> 20:42.912
better way of doing things and if you start to 
generate in them the idea that nothing is

20:43.263 --> 21:03.993
necessarily has to be acceptable or that they can 
always do better, then it creates a tension which

20:43.263 --> 21:03.993
perhaps, you know, does foment some 
revolutionary type ideas. And that's always

21:04.213 --> 21:12.004
something that was sort of a delicate balance of 
whether you could continue the various programs

21:13.199 --> 21:23.435
in country or whether they were going to pull the 
plug because they really didn't trust what was

21:13.199 --> 21:23.435
happening. And a lot of countries decided not to 
continue Peace Corps,

21:23.455 --> 21:31.647
particularly in countries where there was a 
ruling class and there was a disadvantaged class

21:32.082 --> 21:39.268
of people. And if you spent too much time trying to 
improve the conditions of the disadvantaged

21:39.569 --> 22:01.228
class and make them feel that they really could do 
better for themselves, then obviously how far do

21:39.569 --> 22:01.228
you go with that before the ruling class is going to 
say, hey, that's enough of this kind of activity.

22:04.077 --> 22:12.647
This is kind of a broad question, but how did the 
Peace Corps affect your life positively and

22:04.077 --> 22:12.647
negatively, looking back? Well, it certainly 
changed my life on many fronts. First off, I had

22:16.631 --> 22:31.127
never really been out of the United States when I 
joined the Peace Corps program, so it certainly

22:16.631 --> 22:31.127
gave me a lot more of outgoing and global 
perspective than I had before. And the fact that I

22:33.710 --> 22:39.135
met the woman that I fell in love with and married 
her in the Peace Corps. Both of our Peace Corps

22:39.995 --> 22:49.323
volunteer experiences were something that we 
shared a whole lifetime. I think it has profoundly

22:50.544 --> 22:56.669
changed how I view things. You realize all of the 
news when you hear things on the news that are of an

23:04.203 --> 23:23.584
international nature, we realize how slanted 
things can be if you're getting just a news

23:04.203 --> 23:23.584
reporting of something, whereas if you're 
actually in the country and know what's going on,

23:04.203 --> 23:23.584
it can be very much different. So you realize that 
there's a very difficult time in actually

23:32.317 --> 23:58.797
reporting news and avoiding the slanting of news 
so that if you're into international affairs you

23:32.317 --> 23:58.797
really do have to to look at a lot of different 
reports of things and make your own judgment as to

23:32.317 --> 23:58.797
what conditions are really like because there is a 
lot of opportunity to you know, cut things short

23:59.384 --> 24:06.513
and perhaps not come up with the real situation.

24:10.297 --> 24:22.692
I think overall I felt that the Peace Corps 
experience was very positive for me and I actually

24:23.549 --> 24:31.196
decided that I wanted to become a university 
educator and go back and get my PhD. After I did my

24:31.897 --> 24:39.224
two years in the Peace Corps, I went back to the 
University of Missouri and got a PhD. But at the

24:40.245 --> 24:50.755
time that I graduated in 1969, it seemed like there 
was a lot of competition at that time. I started

24:51.140 --> 25:09.640
writing to various universities to send my 
application and they would say, you know, we

24:51.140 --> 25:09.640
appreciate your application, you're applicant 
number 134 for a teaching job at various

24:51.140 --> 25:09.640
universities throughout the country. I realized 
that it was not going to be easy to break into the

25:16.132 --> 25:29.444
teaching at the university level in the U.S. and at 
the same time I was offered a job to go with an oil

25:16.132 --> 25:29.444
company, Pan American Petroleum in Denver, 
Colorado. So I just had to make the choice and I

25:30.685 --> 25:39.873
decided to go into the petroleum business and 
that's where I've been ever since. I found that was

25:39.913 --> 25:44.957
something that really appealed to me as well. So I 
decided to make a career in that. And how that came

25:49.758 --> 25:55.388
from the effect of the Peace Corps had on you? Well, 
it certainly made it more interesting that oil

25:55.408 --> 26:07.789
companies were working in many around-the-world

25:55.408 --> 26:07.789
type of activities. And later on, after spending 
seven years in domestic exploration, I joined the

26:08.073 --> 26:20.406
international group and actually went overseas 
again. And I lived in Argentina for two years, and I

26:20.427 --> 26:30.958
lived in Indonesia and Jakarta for five years. And 
I was also in Japan for about nine months. So I did

26:35.163 --> 26:40.109
spend a great deal of time. And I have made a lot of 
trips into different foreign countries. And so I

26:45.675 --> 26:56.727
think that the Peace Corps experience just kind of 
made it a lot easier to think about living and

26:45.675 --> 26:56.727
working environments outside the United States 
and actually interacting with other cultures and

26:56.993 --> 27:06.070
it wasn't nearly as foreign an idea. So I think it 
kind of broadened my whole horizon and gave me the

27:07.192 --> 27:13.264
feeling that The world is really a lot smaller than 
it looks and feels and that people living and doing

27:13.818 --> 27:32.002
things in different parts of the world are really 
very interesting and really not that much

27:13.818 --> 27:32.002
different from us. You just have to understand 
them and take advantage of all the different ideas

27:32.143 --> 27:41.395
and concepts that they have.

27:44.294 --> 28:03.677
After finishing your tour of duty, did you feel 
that you and the other Peace Corps volunteers you

27:44.294 --> 28:03.677
were in contact with, did you feel like you 
fulfilled the duty that you were sent to do and the

27:44.294 --> 28:03.677
promises that you, or commitments you made to the 
people there? Well, like I said before, it's

28:03.697 --> 28:11.787
always very difficult to judge the effectiveness 
of any particular Peace Corps program. The fact

28:12.172 --> 28:27.455
that they continued the program for many years 
after we left I think was at least some indication

28:12.172 --> 28:27.455
that the country itself felt that it was 
fulfilling a need. Most of the volunteers had

28:27.916 --> 28:33.645
generally pretty positive outlooks when they 
came out. They felt that it was an advantage both to

28:33.665 --> 28:38.432
them and they hoped equally an advantage to the to 
the country itself they felt that they had made

28:38.412 --> 29:07.508
impact on a lot of the people's lives that they made 
good friends of in country we also made friends

28:38.412 --> 29:07.508
with a lot of the faculty that we worked with and 
these experiences I think were you know it's

28:38.412 --> 29:07.508
always important to transfer academic ideas from 
the Peace Corps volunteers to the faculty members

29:08.045 --> 29:19.219
and you never really know how important that is. 
It's sort of cross-pollination and I think that

29:19.300 --> 29:26.108
probably is always healthy. So overall I think 
most of the people felt that it was a valuable

29:27.831 --> 29:33.638
program. They felt that they benefited from it and 
many of them were eager to, you know, either go to a

29:35.602 --> 29:47.442
different Peace Corps environment. Some even, 
you know, went to other countries or continued to

29:47.522 --> 29:55.315
serve after their Peace Corps effort was finished 
in one country. My sister worked for four years in

30:00.101 --> 30:14.569
Tanzania in her assignments, and she felt it was a 
very positive experience

30:00.101 --> 30:14.569
as well.
