WEBVTT

00:02.967 --> 00:14.539
We'd lecture one day a week, and then two different 
days we had sections, a small class deal, and then

00:02.967 --> 00:14.539
one afternoon of four hours a week we had a lab. And 
by the way, my section professor or instructor at

00:15.760 --> 00:29.194
that time turned out to be a friend of mine in later 
years, Harrington. M.T. Harrington? Yeah. Oh my.

00:31.965 --> 00:34.369
Describe him as a professor. Very good. Very good.

00:39.838 --> 00:44.266
He had a certain charisma about him. You had to like 
him. He had a way of getting you interested and

00:54.217 --> 00:59.523
helping you along, and I thought the world of him. 
And after

01:00.204 --> 01:12.358
I left his class, I didn't think I'd ever see him 
again, but it turned out that later on, he and I

01:00.204 --> 01:12.358
became great friends. He used to come down to my 
place in Laredo, and anyway, he was a fine

01:12.418 --> 01:19.887
gentleman, I liked him. I can't say that for 
everyone in the chemistry department. As a

01:27.059 --> 01:33.728
sophomore, I'm getting a little ahead, but I'm 
just saying these things when I remember them. I

01:35.130 --> 01:46.524
had a sophomore professor in comparative, let's 
see,

01:35.130 --> 01:46.524
qualitative analysis. His name I don't remember 
what his first name was, but we called him Wee

01:50.410 --> 01:55.215
Willie, Burchard.

01:58.198 --> 02:02.362
I don't question his knowledge of chemistry. His 
teaching methods I didn't go much for. I guess

02:07.326 --> 02:20.299
it's an effective way, maybe, but he would ask a 
question or you would ask a question And to this day

02:21.713 --> 02:24.458
I never heard him give an answer. I know his method 
was to probably get you on track to solving it

02:26.161 --> 02:42.372
yourself, but this doesn't always, sometimes you 
need a little help. He needed a little help. And he

02:44.492 --> 02:48.778
just carried it a little too far as far as I was 
concerned. But that's neither here nor there. He

02:51.761 --> 02:53.444
was the teacher and I wasn't. But anyway, I had a 
German teacher. His name was Baetjer,

03:02.335 --> 03:10.165
B-A-T-J-E-R.

03:11.562 --> 03:16.429
I got, he taught both first and second year German. 
And so when I got into the class, well, I met it first

03:18.392 --> 03:29.249
two times, and oh, I was doing well. And the second 
time that I met Klaas,

03:38.731 --> 03:45.502
looked at me and he says, , were your parents 
German? And I said, no. I said, they sure weren't.

03:50.089 --> 03:56.619
And he said, well, did you happen to, have you 
studied German? I said, well, I had German in high

03:56.699 --> 03:59.163
school. He says, and you used that for entrance 
credits? And I said, I'm sure I did. I probably used

04:04.832 --> 04:06.274
everything. And he says, you're the wrong class. 
So they moved me to second year German. Well, it so

04:17.753 --> 04:26.445
happened that in second year German, there was 
Helmkamp, Wieser.

04:29.870 --> 04:34.877
Everyone in there, with the exception of a fellow 
named Marshall and myself, all had German

04:35.397 --> 04:37.080
surnames. And Boettcher knew exactly what was 
going on because anything that would happen, you

04:38.462 --> 04:52.587
know, they'd be more or less asleep in class, but if 
they had to read something, they'd just point to

04:38.462 --> 04:52.587
where and they'd come right out. And he announced

04:53.649 --> 04:59.920
one day, somebody asked him, says, Mr. Bacher, how 
do you grade? What is your grading system? And he

05:03.990 --> 05:05.732
says, I use the curve system. And Marshall and I are 
just kind of sunk. He says, of course, that doesn't

05:09.858 --> 05:15.325
apply to Mr. Marshall or Mr. Garner. I'm going to 
grade them normally, but the rest of you guys are on

05:15.405 --> 05:22.334
the curve system. Anyway, that took care of him. I 
don't remember offhand the name of my English

05:31.034 --> 05:33.418
teacher.

05:36.042 --> 05:40.450
Freshman English was the same, it didn't matter, 
you know. And I do remember a sophomore English

05:41.672 --> 05:53.652
teacher I had taught a Shakespeare course, very, 
very interesting. Who? Do you remember him? Seems

05:58.632 --> 06:02.196
like they had a nickname for him called Oyster Joe. 
No, that's history, Oyster Joe Gammon. Well, no.

06:07.562 --> 06:17.033
This fellow was kind of a short, heavy-set man, and 
I can't remember. Wasn't Cofer? No, no. No, it

06:21.541 --> 06:27.649
wasn't

06:21.541 --> 06:27.649
Cofer.

06:32.054 --> 06:40.604
It was literature and

06:32.054 --> 06:40.604
it was practically all Shakespeare. And he was 
very, very interesting. You know, I'd read those

06:45.402 --> 06:54.055
Shakespeare plays or stories or whatever it were, 
and I didn't understand a lot of it. And when he

06:55.978 --> 07:09.298
would read it and explain it, you know, it was then 
when you started appreciating what Shakespeare

06:55.978 --> 07:09.298
was. But it was kind of difficult for uneducated 
boy to know what he was referred to when he made

07:14.410 --> 07:27.189
certain colloquialisms of their time that we 
didn't understand, but that's neither here nor

07:14.410 --> 07:27.189
there. What was the routine for you in terms of 
regular study? What was your when and where and how

07:32.898 --> 07:37.164
did you prepare for class? Well, I'm going to have 
to tell you something that I hesitate,

07:42.997 --> 07:51.646
but it's the truth.

07:54.969 --> 07:56.831
I wasn't the best student in the world. I mean, 
let's put it this way. I had gone through high

08:00.675 --> 08:10.725
school, I'd gone through elementary school, 
everything, high school, I always made grades. I

08:16.133 --> 08:31.451
never made anything lower than a B the whole time I 
was in school, and I never studied, which is bad,

08:16.133 --> 08:31.451
bad. Our schools, I think they're getting away 
from that a lot. All kids, in high school

08:36.743 --> 08:46.736
especially, ought to be challenged so that when 
they do go, they know how to study. I had no idea how

08:47.356 --> 08:50.941
to study. And consequently, I didn't study real 
well. Sure, I passed the A&M. didn't get kicked out

09:03.203 --> 09:21.307
or anything like that, and I made maybe acceptable 
grades, but I could have, I know I could have done so

09:03.203 --> 09:21.307
much better had I applied myself more, or know how 
to apply myself, I think. But also, there's

09:22.829 --> 09:27.214
another thing, and we can all, you know, we all look 
for crutches.

09:29.818 --> 09:33.042
Once December the 7th, 1941 came along.

09:40.928 --> 09:57.332
No, I shouldn't say no one, but very few people in my 
class had their minds on anything else but what's

09:40.928 --> 09:57.332
going to happen here? What's going to happen here? 
We just, we were really in an uncertainty. That's

10:03.020 --> 10:04.682
the first time that what was going on in the world 
really came across to us. And it just affected our

10:12.110 --> 10:20.882
schooling very much. We lived more or less from 
event to event.

10:32.303 --> 10:40.252
enjoyed pleasant things as much as we could, court 
trips, football games. All right, let's venture

10:41.934 --> 10:44.217
in that direction. On the campus, for you as a 
freshman, describe the routine in the dining

10:45.358 --> 10:52.206
hall.

10:55.030 --> 11:00.336
Well,

10:55.030 --> 11:00.336
we were in, Duncan Hall is freshman and We went to 
the had a table of about ten people at a table About

11:02.071 --> 11:28.129
half of them were freshmen and Seniors that the two 
ends of the table Juniors that if there was no

11:02.071 --> 11:28.129
seniors present and and sophomores at the other 
places, and your main function was to be sure that

11:28.835 --> 11:41.511
they didn't want for anything.

11:43.594 --> 11:57.492
In fact, you were really better off if you didn't 
start eating until after they were ready to get up

11:43.594 --> 11:57.492
and leave, and then you hurriedly ate what you 
could.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.590
I don't want it to sound like anybody was underfed. 
We were not. Everybody was amply fed. No kush, no

12:06.237 --> 12:15.514
dessert until after a certain day, and every day 
we'd have to say, 100 days till Cush, or 99 days till

12:16.388 --> 12:20.052
Cush. And if somebody did something wrong, they'd 
say, that'll be five more days. So they'd go to 102

12:24.978 --> 12:36.371
days till Cush, which usually went till 
Thanksgiving, and then everybody got to Cush.

12:38.714 --> 12:46.142
One thing at the

12:38.714 --> 12:46.142
dining hall at noon,

12:47.253 --> 12:51.017
That's when they would call out special delivery 
letters. And, of course, that was a big thing if

12:52.298 --> 12:58.985
your name was called that you had a special 
delivery letter to pick up. And they played what we

13:00.426 --> 13:06.272
think of now, and I did even then. I've always been 
kind of a music buff. They played the most gorgeous

13:09.375 --> 13:14.020
music of the big band era. at that time the miller 
and during the meals oh yes really yes nobody's

13:14.455 --> 13:43.365
ever mentioned that before yeah really so over a pa 
system in duncan yes sir yes sir what was the

13:14.455 --> 13:43.365
quality of the food it was good really everybody 
griped you know when people griped about the army

13:14.455 --> 13:43.365
food i had wonderful food did you have any favorite 
aggie foods

13:46.484 --> 13:47.645
No, not really. Not really. Was there any that you 
particularly didn't like?

13:53.451 --> 14:14.694
No, I guess really and truly I

13:53.451 --> 14:14.694
was always an eater and I guess that came from my 
bringing up with at my home my mother put the food on

13:53.451 --> 14:14.694
the table and you ate what was on the table and if you 
didn't like that you didn't say anything about it.

14:14.734 --> 14:16.356
You either ate it or you just waited until the next 
meal. And I never had any problem with the food. I

14:21.753 --> 14:30.885
had a lot of friends that were waiters that kind of 
take care of you a little bit. Go ahead. I was going

14:33.829 --> 14:35.151
to say, were there any jokes? Did you all play any 
pranks during meals?

14:48.112 --> 15:11.436
Not a whole lot of it really, other than when it came 
time for fish sergeant, they usually would take

14:48.112 --> 15:11.436
the most gullible freshman in the outfit and they 
would, a little bit ahead of time, they'd start

14:48.112 --> 15:11.436
building this up. that you know says this outfit's 
getting kind of rank and it needs somebody to

15:12.901 --> 15:32.309
really keep things going and keep things under 
control and says we just don't seem to have anybody

15:12.901 --> 15:32.309
to do that and we're going to have to get us a fish 
sergeant. And they would always pick in an outfit

15:40.238 --> 15:49.351
the most gullible person that they could find and 
tell him that he was, make him fish sergeant. And

15:49.371 --> 15:54.639
they'd say, now listen, when you're fish 
sergeant, you have senior privileges. You do

15:55.801 --> 16:01.349
whatever you want to, but you do have to keep order. 
And then they would stage a little set to at which

16:03.031 --> 16:08.980
time he'd really catch hell because they'd stage a 
little fight, but they'd really let him have it.

16:16.244 --> 16:22.797
That's about it there in the mess hall. Describe a, 
let's see, in mess hall, did you all have cush

16:23.639 --> 16:29.010
questions? No, not to my knowledge. Now, I've 
heard in the 50s that that was a ritual. And for you

16:35.758 --> 16:48.197
as a fish, even once cush was available to 
freshmen, before you got your cush, you had to

16:35.758 --> 16:48.197
answer a question for which they would have 
movable answers. One of the favorites was, how

16:49.257 --> 16:52.540
many stars are there in the Texas flag? And if you 
answered one, they said, no, there's two. There's

16:55.723 --> 16:56.843
one on each side. And if you said two, they'd say, 
no, there's one. It goes all the way through. So you

17:00.907 --> 17:02.989
still didn't get your cook. Let's see. Describe a 
typical day, class day. What time did you get up?

17:10.075 --> 17:12.557
What happened all the way through that day? Okay.

17:17.801 --> 17:18.522
Reveille. If I'm not mistaken, Reveille was 
usually about a quarter to seven, or seven, right

17:19.396 --> 17:29.332
around that time. However, as a freshman, you had 
to get up and go clean. You were a maid for an

17:36.302 --> 17:42.432
upperclassman, or maybe two upperclassmen, 
depending. When

17:42.933 --> 17:47.580
the semester started, that each upperclassman's 
room had two, but as the freshmen thinned out, got

17:48.556 --> 18:03.890
down to where one guy had one room, I cleaned up for a 
couple of seniors.

18:07.914 --> 18:15.441
Well, no, I started out cleaning up for two 
juniors, and it was wonderful. They were great

18:16.332 --> 18:17.673
guys. They weren't as tied up in getting on the 
freshmen as most people were. And they were both,

18:26.782 --> 18:33.368
they both liked athletics. And I always played on 
the intramural football and basketball and other

18:34.629 --> 18:43.217
teams. We always worked together, so I had a good 
deal there. Then I,

18:46.610 --> 19:07.828
freshman, I mean, seniors always had two-room 
orders, and one of those

18:46.610 --> 19:07.828
pairs of that, of one pair, they lost one, and I had 
to move and go take care of that fellow. So anyway,

19:07.848 --> 19:11.972
that was early in the morning, and then you'd, 
after you got their room cleaned up and you'd come

19:14.298 --> 19:23.092
and fix your own then you'd fall out and you'd march 
to breakfast. You always marched to the mess hall

19:23.353 --> 19:37.335
but then came back to your room and for the most part 
from after breakfast until you went to class if you

19:23.353 --> 19:37.335
had an eight o'clock there was no much going on. You 
just got ready and went to class.

19:47.974 --> 19:55.704
You had to have your schedule posted on the door of 
your room. And when you weren't in class, you

19:57.066 --> 20:06.799
better be in that room so that you would be 
available to run errands or whatever they wanted

20:07.538 --> 20:12.503
you to do. And supposedly you could study at that 
time if you wanted to, but that was kind of out of the

20:14.264 --> 20:21.351
question. The only time you could study is very 
rarely if everybody else was, all the sophomores

20:21.411 --> 20:28.818
were somewhere else. If they didn't have another 
opportunity, they'd use you to amuse themselves

20:28.898 --> 20:36.465
in some way. So you can more or less forget about 
studying in the daytime unless you were having

20:37.390 --> 20:45.898
problems with, real problems with a course. And 
you could always go to the seniors and they would

20:46.679 --> 20:55.787
get a quietus and, but you better not be lying about 
it. You better be telling. And we had,

20:58.309 --> 21:04.275
in the afternoons, well, in the afternoons. One 
afternoon we had a drill and

21:07.026 --> 21:31.130
there just wasn't a lot of time, intramural 
practice or intramural things and then by that

21:07.026 --> 21:31.130
time it's time to get back and go to eat and then come 
back and then get in your room and that is about it.

21:32.331 --> 21:35.494
There was, we left We didn't go out at nights except 
to yell practice or something special. At that

21:46.985 --> 21:51.392
time we went to Guyon Hall for different features. 
Where could you during the day go outside the

21:53.715 --> 21:58.703
dormitory to study? Yes, if you'd have to get 
permission. And you could get permission

22:06.541 --> 22:10.789
supposedly to go to the library.

22:15.818 --> 22:20.787
But boy, if you signed out to go to that library, you 
better be there. If you got caught, you got your ass

22:21.107 --> 22:27.739
beat.

22:27.871 --> 22:38.348
This was not supposed to be going on, well I don't 
guess it ever was supposed to be going on, but it was

22:27.871 --> 22:38.348
still going on in 1941, I'll tell you. The 
paddling. Describe one of those sessions. Where

22:42.455 --> 22:44.738
did it happen and who did it, who was there? Well, in 
our outfit, they took the board privileges away

22:46.842 --> 22:55.195
from the sophomores. And it was practically all 
administered by a senior or a junior. And

23:05.089 --> 23:14.319
we had some done by sophomores, but who's going to 
turn him in? And it was a normal deal.

23:23.322 --> 23:35.651
But when they told you to grab a pooch, well you 
reached down and got ahold of your trout and pulled

23:23.322 --> 23:35.651
it up, your butt as tight as it was, and you usually 
got three hits. And the paddle was made out of what?

23:40.242 --> 23:40.723
Wood. So they weren't using bats? Oh, no, no, I 
never. I've heard those stories and they could

23:46.986 --> 23:56.721
have taken place, but during my time they had some 
elaborate boards, baby, but they were boards.

23:56.901 --> 24:01.208
They were not what the bat, no, and it was flat. And 
this happened in the hallway? Usually in the

24:04.893 --> 24:06.576
hallway, uh-huh. The hallway or in the bathroom. 
You know, we had big bathrooms over there. And

24:13.200 --> 24:15.483
there were a good number of witnesses? Oh, yes, 
always. At least, well, when I say a good number, at

24:17.365 --> 24:25.575
least two people there witnessing it. Do you 
remember any freshman pranks, jokes, good bull

24:25.775 --> 24:30.601
your first year?

24:33.384 --> 24:36.428
Well, I don't. We had a couple of guys that weren't 
real popular in our outfit, and I've been ashamed

24:39.074 --> 24:52.751
of this, but I'm going to tell you anyway.

24:54.693 --> 25:06.347
When we would go down and have, just before taps,

24:54.693 --> 25:06.347
we'd go out and have a little yell practice

25:08.386 --> 25:09.387
battery area. And we were usually out there about 
fifteen minutes, from tattoo to taps, ten

25:11.509 --> 25:21.418
minutes, whatever it was. Well,

25:23.219 --> 25:36.992
when we went out there that evening, another 
fellow and myself went in these boys'

25:38.626 --> 25:44.656
And we did open their closet doors and take all 
their shoes and put them up on the bed. And then we,

25:46.579 --> 26:04.448
in the

25:46.579 --> 26:04.448
laboratory that was there, had the plug in the 
bottom, and the overflow deal, we stuffed it with

25:46.579 --> 26:04.448
the deal and turned on both water spigots all the 
way, you know. I mean this wasn't anything

26:04.732 --> 26:11.359
original, but it was the only time it had happened 
in that dormitory that year. And then we'd go out

26:11.379 --> 26:25.875
and we'd put a towel down there so when the door was 
closed, water wouldn't run under the deal. I don't

26:26.235 --> 26:29.659
say some didn't seep, but there wasn't much 
running. Well, you can't believe, or maybe you can

26:31.900 --> 26:43.893
believe, how much water in 10 to 15 minutes can 
accumulate in a room that size. And I'm telling

26:45.795 --> 26:50.580
you, when they came back, they couldn't hardly 
open that door. It swung to the inside, you see. And

26:54.804 --> 26:58.448
when they did get that thing open and water comes 
out and down the hall and down the steps and down to

26:59.322 --> 27:04.668
the bottom. And it was funny, but it was not funny. 
Were these, now were the victims sophomores? No,

27:13.617 --> 27:15.039
the victims were freshmen. Oh, they were 
freshmen,

27:15.159 --> 27:19.563
okay. And they were a couple of freshmen that, you 
know, you punished your own, you took care of your

27:19.583 --> 27:27.912
own. I really was kind of a... Now were the guilty 
parties in this ever discovered? No, no, no, no.

27:35.724 --> 27:37.706
And the freshmen had to clean up their own room? 
Well, no, every freshman had to help. Oh, okay.

27:42.311 --> 27:50.821
Because if it would have just been their room, it 
would have been one thing, but it came out and down

27:42.311 --> 27:50.821
the hall and everything else, you see. But anyway, 
I mean a lot of people had Pretty good idea who it

27:54.267 --> 27:58.811
was, but there was no real accusations ever made. 
All right. Still that first fall, do you remember

28:00.152 --> 28:07.078
your first Yale practice, midnight Yale 
practice?

28:09.440 --> 28:20.190
I don't necessarily remember my first one, but I 
do, we had,

28:09.440 --> 28:20.190
I remember my first air out. Are you familiar with 
air out? Describe that. All right. I found out

28:24.997 --> 28:47.480
later, we didn't know at the time, and you know 
there's always somebody in an outfit or something

28:24.997 --> 28:47.480
that their brother had gone to A&M or their uncle or 
old friend or something. And a lot of them had

28:48.200 --> 28:54.987
previous information that some of us others 
didn't have. Sometimes they were a little

28:56.047 --> 28:59.211
reluctant to pass it on. But anyway, before the 
first home game, we'd have an air out, which they

29:00.653 --> 29:09.464
called an air out. Well, it wasn't too bad for me. I 
was living on the second floor. I could go right out

29:16.173 --> 29:25.665
that window, but those third floor boys, they had 
to come back and go down the steps and all that kind

29:16.173 --> 29:25.665
of stuff. But first thing you do about it, you heard 
somebody yell, air out freshmen. And I mean, they

29:33.713 --> 29:39.700
had belts and things like that, you know, and 
popping them around. And we, my roommate and I had a

29:39.820 --> 29:47.950
little previous knowledge that there was going, 
that was going to take place. And we were ready. And

29:50.173 --> 29:51.214
when they, when we heard the first noise, we had our 
titty shoes on and we went right out that window on

29:51.886 --> 30:01.446
that second floor. And we, you didn't show up until 
the next morning, you know. But Yale practice was a

30:07.398 --> 30:11.346
great thing. Where was it held? Over in front of 
Goodwin, Goodwin Hall at that time. Goodwin Hall.

30:19.442 --> 30:22.270
Now, was it a midnight yell practice? Was it held 
that late? No. It was usually around noon. rent

30:29.146 --> 30:58.596
seven thirty on friday nights right before the 
game and so the primary wait a minute excuse me just

30:29.146 --> 30:58.596
meant it was on friday night for home game for home 
games and the people who were there were almost

30:29.146 --> 30:58.596
core students only because there weren't many 
there would be a few teachers instructors and so on

30:29.146 --> 30:58.596
and so forth and a few girls but not many out of town 
dates No, there might have been a few, but I hardly

30:58.981 --> 31:10.073
remember any because the girls that came to home 
games usually didn't arrive until Saturday. Do

31:11.555 --> 31:15.078
you remember going to those first home football 
games? What was that like? It was a revelation to me

31:16.860 --> 31:28.633
to go and stand up at a football game all the time.
