00:05.937 --> 00:25.043
If you're really able to understand the 
importance of planning to this kind of community,

00:05.937 --> 00:25.043
to this community, and how we as planners have 
handled it, I don't need to dwell on the

00:05.937 --> 00:25.043
transportation plan. I think it's very obvious to 
everyone why we approved the transportation

00:25.083 --> 00:33.615
plan, and we used that as a way to carry forth our 
planning process, but we haven't always done

00:25.083 --> 00:33.615
that. The planners under the direction of Kern 
Ewing and other persons who have succeeded Kern

00:35.570 --> 01:02.287
have made a very honest and diligent effort to 
press the city management and city council into

00:35.570 --> 01:02.287
allowing us to develop another comprehensive 
plan, something that will be acceptable and

00:35.570 --> 01:02.287
adoptable by the city government of Corpus 
Christi, meaning its city council. Who were some

01:02.767 --> 01:05.391
of these other people? with the demise of Kern 
Ewing and Linus Jameson and of the entire

01:05.708 --> 01:14.278
community renewal program itself. What happened 
to Kern Ewing? Kern had left. He had worked himself

01:18.023 --> 01:19.745
into it. He was a very highly principled planner. 
He didn't compromise his principles very much,

01:21.487 --> 01:28.155
regardless of the pressures that were put on him. 
And I think Kern, like a lot of idealistic persons

01:28.321 --> 01:44.794
that are highly principled, also didn't realize 
the difficulty that our administration was in in

01:28.321 --> 01:44.794
pursuing a comprehensive plan. Let me just say, I 
think it was just by mutual agreement it would be

01:46.124 --> 01:50.148
better. It was both best for the city of Corpus 
Christi and best for Kern that he resign. And he

01:55.494 --> 01:55.955
did. And everyone who has resigned from our office 
has generally gone to a better job. Kern had gone

02:00.520 --> 02:07.447
to, he became the director of planning for Bob 
Armstrong in the state land office after he left

02:00.520 --> 02:07.447
Corpus. And so it was great. Linus Jameson then 
assumed the title under the reorganization. as a

02:15.065 --> 02:16.928
senior planner. And then who were some of the other 
staff planners who were leading the city council

02:17.649 --> 02:30.006
to ask very serious questions about community 
improvement? Well, I think the only one seriously

02:30.026 --> 02:40.561
who took a very active role in doing that, at least 
through the planning commission, was Mr. Bruce

02:30.026 --> 02:40.561
McClendon. Bruce McClendon was a senior planner. 
hired by Mr. Winger, or Mr. Anderson, and worked in

02:43.651 --> 02:50.842
the planning department. An extremely capable 
person. Bruce was not within our community

02:53.126 --> 02:57.693
renewal function. Very quick, let me tell you what 
happened, and I feel I can get my date straight. I

03:02.140 --> 03:06.587
think it was around late 1974, early 75. city 
manager decided that he wanted to reorganize,

03:08.018 --> 03:12.982
Mark Towns, reorganize the city government. And 
at that time, they decided to create one of the

03:13.883 --> 03:27.815
super departments, or four super departments, 
for the purpose of reducing the number of people

03:13.883 --> 03:27.815
who actually, who had to deal with the city manager 
directly. Although, you know, before he had to

03:27.835 --> 03:32.239
have to work with everyone on a one-to-one basis. 
And Mr. Towns' type of management at that time was,

03:38.242 --> 03:57.160
to do everything, to supervise everything, to 
personally sign off on everything, even from

03:38.242 --> 03:57.160
hiring people at lower grades, lower grade 
people, to personally signing off on all

03:38.242 --> 03:57.160
subdivision things and all zoning actions and 
recommendations. And for that reason, Mr.

03:57.180 --> 04:00.884
Townsend worked from 8 o'clock in the morning to 
midnight every night. And he usually worked seven

04:01.144 --> 04:05.228
days a week.

04:06.153 --> 04:19.773
Under the reorganization, the Community Renewal 
Program phased out and we phased in, of course the

04:06.153 --> 04:19.773
money was phasing out too, we phased in the 701 
Planning Program, which Linus Jameson came in

04:06.153 --> 04:19.773
charge of. That became the long-range planning 
division of the Department of Planning. And also

04:26.904 --> 04:33.173
in that reorganization, it made Mr. Jonas Briones 
the Director of Planning and Urban Development.

04:33.558 --> 04:41.530
Mr. Anderson, who was already at retirement age, 
if he had chose to stay on, would have been the

04:33.558 --> 04:41.530
Director of Intergovernmental Affairs. And that 
job simply would have been coordinating about

04:42.051 --> 04:48.701
city activities with other governmental 
jurisdictions. Mr. Anderson decided at that time

04:49.662 --> 04:56.633
that he would rather retire.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.357
And he went from there. He moved into, which I'm 
sure you're aware of now, consulting work, not on a

05:03.005 --> 05:11.538
full-time basis, but part-time, and he was 
associated with Harlem Bartholomew in the

05:03.005 --> 05:11.538
consulting office he set up down here. Under the 
leadership of Mr. Briones, who is, I don't really

05:13.541 --> 05:20.011
consider Mr. Briones anti-planning. I hear a lot 
of people say that he is, but he's not. But one of the

05:25.059 --> 05:30.868
things that Mr. Briones wanted to emphasize since 
Kern left, Kern never joined us over here, He

05:31.355 --> 05:35.560
resigned before the changeover took place. We 
physically moved our offices from the center of

05:35.700 --> 05:41.267
downtown over to the present city hall. And we had 
long-range planning and we had current planning.

05:45.191 --> 05:50.257
And I was in the long-range planning still just as a 
planner. And one of the things that had happened in

05:51.178 --> 05:55.303
that transition, too, is that In 1974, the city 
just had rejected by the Department of

05:56.127 --> 06:06.061
Transportation, Urban Mass Transportation 
Administration, an application for purchase of

05:56.127 --> 06:06.061
new buses. It was a Section 3 capital grant. And the 
reason it was rejected is because the Department

06:08.264 --> 06:26.050
of Transportation had extended its planning 
requirements to cover transit operations and

06:08.264 --> 06:26.050
required that prior to awarding any capital 
grants for purchase of major capital items, such

06:08.264 --> 06:26.050
as buses or building new facilities, that they 
would want to see some sort of overall planning

06:26.890 --> 06:35.602
document. In other words, some sort of assurance 
that this isn't a fly-by-night type of thing.

06:40.249 --> 06:49.622
These decisions are made within the parameters of 
a well-thought-out growth document for transit

06:40.249 --> 06:49.622
improvement. Same kinds of requirements that are 
placed on highway improvements. I was asked to

06:54.110 --> 07:02.984
temporarily take over the assignment of doing a 
five-year transit development plan, a long range

06:54.110 --> 07:02.984
transit plan for the city. What year was this? This 
was 1974 that I took that over. That was when John

07:08.072 --> 07:14.882
Hurtin was heading up UMTA in Washington, I 
believe. He may have been, yeah. I really didn't at

07:17.726 --> 07:20.050
that time pay too much attention paid too much mind 
to who was heading up what. I dealt primarily with

07:23.448 --> 07:25.431
the regional offices. And I got into it. I really 
enjoyed it. I loved the transit work that I did. I

07:31.618 --> 07:34.181
liked getting around all those buses. But all the 
time, I thought this was only a temporary

07:35.002 --> 07:45.514
assignment, and that eventually, a 
transportation planner as opposed to a General

07:46.152 --> 07:57.569
Staff Planner would be brought in to assume those 
duties, and I would go back to my own duties as a

07:46.152 --> 07:57.569
physical planner for the Advanced Planning or 
Long Range Planning Division. And it didn't

07:57.589 --> 07:58.350
happen. We ended up, Ernest created a 
Transportation Planning Division within the

07:59.672 --> 08:10.928
department and promoted me from Planner 1 to 
Planner 2 to a Senior Planner, and there I stayed.

08:11.887 --> 08:28.484
And I got involved in very few other planning 
activities, but it did allow me the opportunity,

08:11.887 --> 08:28.484
as someone not involved, to observe as an outsider 
close to everything what was happening, since my

08:11.887 --> 08:28.484
transportation plans, or the city's 
transportation plans, was the only tool that we

08:11.887 --> 08:28.484
could push planning programs through. Linus 
Jamison was still part of the old Community of No

08:31.046 --> 08:41.657
Program, and therefore there was still a lot of 
resentment, I think, from the top down, of her

08:31.046 --> 08:41.657
ideas on planning. Let me tell you, first of all, 
that if we can put this planning in perspective,

08:42.076 --> 08:52.952
Mr. Townsend's idea of a plan was the zoning 
ordinance. In his opinion, and he had said many

08:53.172 --> 08:59.642
times, we don't need a comprehensive plan, we have 
one, and that's the zoning ordinance. The present

09:00.804 --> 09:03.628
zoning. you can fully realize how that makes us 
planners feel, knowing that that's very

09:04.300 --> 09:09.272
noteworthy. That's a little surprising 
considering the fact that he had undertaken a

09:09.292 --> 09:19.357
substantial number of planning courses at 
Cornell.

09:19.377 --> 09:20.740
I think I can understand Mr. Townsend's point of 
view to a certain extent. One of the things that I

09:28.383 --> 09:46.272
believe bothered him about planning more than 
anything else was that plans, in a sense,

09:28.383 --> 09:46.272
suggested a commitment to do something further 
down the road. than what the city manager was

09:46.758 --> 09:57.047
willing to do, you know, to change various land 
uses, to affect certain growth trends, to...

09:57.828 --> 09:59.129
There was a difference in time frames. And he 
didn't like these commitments, even though they

09:59.229 --> 10:03.412
were just insinuated. And he was very afraid of the 
fact, for example, if someone would bring in a

10:03.753 --> 10:15.803
general land use plan and they'd look at it and say, 
see, it's got some red there, and that meant you

10:03.753 --> 10:15.803
promised back whenever you approved that plan You 
promised that I was going to be able to develop that

10:16.019 --> 10:20.865
property as commercial, and that wasn't the 
intent of a plan. And as you know and I know, a plan

10:21.105 --> 10:27.833
isn't worth the paper it's written on unless it's 
flexible enough to meet the needs of the

10:21.105 --> 10:27.833
community. And Mr. Townsend did not want to have to 
deal with that kind of flexibility. Mr.

10:33.619 --> 10:37.063
Townsend's idea of a planning function... He 
sounds like he didn't want to deal with commitment

10:37.103 --> 10:41.008
either, let alone flexibility.

10:44.292 --> 10:45.553
Mr. Townsend's forte... finances as most 
effective managers are understanding the

10:46.057 --> 11:14.713
finances of the city that they run and it is a big 
business and

10:46.057 --> 11:14.713
his understanding of finances didn't fit any kind 
of any kind of plan and his idea of planning or his

10:46.057 --> 11:14.713
idea of what a planning department should do was to 
provide management with information on a

11:15.436 --> 11:24.550
day-to-day basis that they need for making a 
decision. And if those planning kinds of

11:25.831 --> 11:39.392
documents that we develop address what some of our 
conditions would be 10, 15, 20 years down the road,

11:25.831 --> 11:39.392
it didn't mean much to him because he wasn't 
concerned about that. He was concerned about

11:39.452 --> 11:43.738
capital improvements over a three-year period. 
and next year. New York City went bankrupt with

11:47.930 --> 11:52.155
such a short range perspective. I suppose you 
could say that because Corpus Christi has been

11:52.175 --> 12:12.038
such conservative in its administration and also 
very conservative in its growth that in a way we

11:52.175 --> 12:12.038
were inadvertently blessed in that we have 
developed for appearances sake, as a

12:13.435 --> 12:16.280
well-planned community. But what's really 
happened is that we have been subjected to the

12:18.142 --> 12:33.787
growth spurts that San Antonio's and Austin's and 
Houston's and Dallas's have been, because if we

12:18.142 --> 12:33.787
had, I think everything would have been well out of 
control. And also that you've got to understand

12:33.807 --> 12:37.333
the community itself, people who've lived here, 
who are the leaders here, are very proud of this

12:37.870 --> 12:41.335
city. They're very proud of the way it looks. 
They're very proud of the fact that it's

12:43.218 --> 12:48.245
considered an extremely clean city. And, you 
know, I've heard people from the outside, very

12:49.007 --> 12:55.797
professional people, like from New York, to say 
that it's so clean it's sterile. And that's not

12:57.139 --> 12:59.222
good. Well, I'm not sure whether that's good or 
bad. I'm not even sure if I know what they mean by

13:03.949 --> 13:06.433
sterile. I just know that We do have a lot more room 
for growth. But yes, you're right about that's

13:10.130 --> 13:15.475
what drove New York City into bankruptcy. But 
we're not New York City. We're very small. We're a

13:18.438 --> 13:26.205
population of around, we're a population in 1970 
of 201,000, and we're a population in 1980 of

13:18.438 --> 13:26.205
230,000. And the majority of that growth has 
occurred over the last four years. Largely, what

13:33.171 --> 13:35.113
do you attribute the growth to?

13:38.300 --> 13:45.572
Well, I think the kind of growth that we have, our 
growth is attributed primarily to natural

13:38.300 --> 13:45.572
increases. We haven't been subjected to a heavy 
in-migration of new people. I believe we're going

13:50.480 --> 13:51.843
to be seeing that. I think that the job 
opportunities in Corpus Christi are not that

13:52.404 --> 13:58.193
good. The job opportunities that are here are in 
the petroleum industry, usually for skilled type

14:03.916 --> 14:07.961
of laborers. And the petroleum industry pretty 
well takes care of that. And the other kinds of jobs

14:12.307 --> 14:17.834
that are here, and on a much lesser scale, are in the 
domestic area. People working in hotels and

14:18.896 --> 14:21.980
restaurants and cleaners, et cetera. Tourists. 
Yeah, people that are responding to the tourist

14:24.363 --> 14:27.226
needs. Tourists is one of the major, if not the 
major, industry approaches here. Our growth over

14:33.447 --> 14:38.892
the past has been natural increases as opposed to a 
migration trend. As a matter of fact, the

14:38.912 --> 15:01.834
Community Renewal Program did a study in 1974,

14:38.912 --> 15:01.834
which was what we entitled a Household Movement 
Study, in which we documented that we were losing

14:38.912 --> 15:01.834
people, people moving out, moving out primarily 
to Houston and then to San Antonio. The only thing

15:02.017 --> 15:08.804
that kept our population even, or with a very 
minimal growth, was our natural increase. That

15:08.824 --> 15:10.866
was a very controversial report. I bet it was. 
Because it was telling the community leaders, the

15:12.448 --> 15:16.091
Chamber of Commerce people, that people were 
leaving. They couldn't, because the kinds of

15:16.912 --> 15:23.699
people that were attracting, everyone wants to 
attract these skilled laborers, the high-income

15:16.912 --> 15:23.699
people. That's not it. This community doesn't 
have that to offer. And maybe it will. It is of sorts

15:29.585 --> 15:31.467
a very... favorite in the retirement area. It is 
also a retirement community for a lot of the

15:35.714 --> 15:43.083
elderly affluent people. Not people who live in 
noble homes. No, not people who live in noble

15:45.206 --> 15:46.767
homes. I think a lot of people who buy condominiums 
and townhouses of sorts or apartments. The Navy,

15:52.394 --> 16:01.285
for example, the Naval Air Station Facility, 
which also includes an Army helicopter repair

15:52.394 --> 16:01.285
depot, both of which employ a lot of civilians and a 
lot of Navy personnel. These people are brought in

16:06.230 --> 16:10.296
usually from the outside. They're highly skilled 
people, and they enjoy it here. And when they

16:13.441 --> 16:16.446
retire from those jobs, they stay here. And that's 
where a lot of the retirement people come from. Or

16:20.072 --> 16:29.787
people who have served here in the Navy or Army at 
one time before in the past, and then they retire,

16:20.072 --> 16:29.787
come back here because they like to. Did I lose my 
train of thought here?

16:36.568 --> 16:38.290
All right, picking up with Mr. McClendon. Mr. 
McClendon was senior planner, hired a senior

16:39.471 --> 16:45.998
planner from Oklahoma. I believe he had been a 
director of planning for one of the small cities in

16:46.018 --> 16:50.843
Oklahoma. I don't recall which one it was. Maybe it 
was Lawton. I'm not sure. Graduate of the OU

16:55.148 --> 16:58.592
planning program. very sound planner very good 
person and if you ever if anyone knows bruce you

17:00.243 --> 17:23.854
know that he is a what i consider a mover he was in 
charge of planning and there was a little bit of

17:00.243 --> 17:23.854
conflict when we made the transition here we have a 
long-range planning division under the

17:00.243 --> 17:23.854
direction of a senior planner doing long-range 
planning work that bruce extremely capable of

17:00.243 --> 17:23.854
doing and was working with her miss jameson being a 
part of the Old Community Road Program and also

17:25.640 --> 17:33.387
looking for a change and wanting to get, you know, 
move forward. And as you said in the past, Bob,

17:33.427 --> 17:44.297
people, planners, young, particularly young 
planners, their advancement usually comes with

17:33.427 --> 17:44.297
several jobs, not just staying with one city. And 
Linna did. She left in 75, I believe, or 76, can't

17:45.458 --> 17:54.887
remember exactly, and went up to Kansas City to 
work for the planning office up there, and I

17:55.087 --> 17:58.030
understand she's done very well. At the time, 
prior to, I think one of the things that helped Ms.

17:59.571 --> 18:15.485
Jameson leave was the fact that during her stay 
here, although she wasn't demoted in any way,

17:59.571 --> 18:15.485
Bruce was put in charge of her program as a senior 
planner, and she became answerable to Bruce. And

18:15.745 --> 18:19.388
professionally, I think she felt a little bit hurt 
with regard to that. But Bruce was going to also was

18:19.849 --> 18:24.773
very impressive in that he was going to provide a 
new direction in planning, and I think the

18:25.073 --> 18:34.106
management people, the administrators, the city 
manager, Mr. Briones, all felt that he had what it

18:25.073 --> 18:34.106
took to get the job done. And Bruce did. I've never 
seen an office produce, a planning office produce

18:36.609 --> 18:41.596
so many reports in such a short period of time. 
Under Bruce's leadership, prepared and

18:42.097 --> 18:54.574
published an updated economic study of the city of 
Corpus Christi, physical determinants of land

18:42.097 --> 18:54.574
use study for the city, and A very well-known 
document among other professional planners is

18:55.550 --> 19:05.882
what we call our housing element, but actually not 
known at all. And the economic study, the housing

19:08.565 --> 19:15.293
element, they all had policy-type statements in 
it. And all these documents were a forerunner of

19:16.455 --> 19:23.683
Bruce's ultimate plan of getting Planning 
Commission and City Council to agree to allow the

19:24.068 --> 19:29.797
staff to prepare for the city a comprehensive 
plan. Now here we're coming back again. Mr.

19:33.763 --> 19:45.621
Ewing's downfall, Mrs. Jameson's downfall, was 
trying to be, was pressuring the preparation and

19:33.763 --> 19:45.621
approval of a comprehensive plan. Now, and all of 
which have been unsuccessful. And there's ways of

19:50.444 --> 19:55.970
moving projects through an elected body and 
there's ways of not doing it. I feel that I have the

19:55.990 --> 20:05.461
political savvy of how to handle delicate 
documents like that and not move them through so

19:55.990 --> 20:05.461
quickly and help convince things that I have 
picked up from Mr. Cunningham. And Bruce thought

20:05.961 --> 20:07.923
that he could probably do it too. You know, he was a 
gifted person as far as persuading people to do

20:08.264 --> 20:12.869
things. And up until Bruce came in and started 
doing this, The only thing that, as far as planning

20:18.997 --> 20:30.015
documents that we had utilized, which were 
approved, were the updates to the transportation

20:18.997 --> 20:30.015
plans called annual reports. And we did that every 
year. And again, it was a requirement. But it was an

20:33.300 --> 20:41.453
effective requirement, and it kept us on target 
with our long-range transportation plan codes.

20:43.776 --> 20:44.818
But that wasn't enough. And I think the annual 
reports began to deteriorate as time went on. And

20:52.742 --> 21:02.133
they really never did deal with enough detail with 
other elements of a comprehensive plan. And

21:03.294 --> 21:04.836
that's what Bruce was trying to do. He was trying to 
bring to the city an approved document that dealt

21:05.216 --> 21:14.687
with housing, that dealt with community 
facilities, that dealt with land uses, that dealt

21:05.216 --> 21:14.687
with urban design. very important. You mentioned 
the housing report. What is the status of that and

21:21.488 --> 21:28.094
what is the cause of the status? You're probably a 
little bit more familiar with the housing report

21:30.217 --> 21:38.425
in that you had a lot to do in getting it started 
under a program of a local section. It was an AIP

21:38.605 --> 21:40.467
section at that time. Bruce brought in, and of 
course Bruce was a real real big on continuing

21:44.114 --> 21:55.911
education of our fellow planners in this area, and 
you were brought down as an invited guest or

21:44.114 --> 21:55.911
however, but you agreed to come down and you taught 
basically a course here. I didn't get to take it,

21:56.512 --> 22:07.708
but you taught a course here, and the project was to 
do a plan summary, which the students or the staff,

21:56.512 --> 22:07.708
the staff members were That was your participants 
in the course. The kind of classic unified summary

22:11.123 --> 22:14.647
for a comprehensive plan. That's right. As the 
final examination of the course. And one of the

22:17.451 --> 22:25.520
results of this course was a unified summary that 
was tied to a housing element. And the housing

22:25.540 --> 22:28.743
element is a large report. It's extremely well 
done. It looks good. It was professionally

22:33.068 --> 22:35.451
prepared and published. And there was a lot of arm 
twisting to get it published. But it contained

22:40.476 --> 23:03.506
within that housing element a lot of goals, 
housing policies that actually, after it was done

22:40.476 --> 23:03.506
and printed and Mr. Townsend looked at it, felt 
that, well, I do not want, he did not personally

22:40.476 --> 23:03.506
want to be held committed to those kinds of goals 
and selling those goals to city councils as they

22:40.476 --> 23:03.506
would change from year to year. And... I believe 
there's about 150, 200 copies of that report that

23:05.468 --> 23:11.054
were published. And Mr. McClendon tried in vain on 
many occasions to get a formal and official

23:11.335 --> 23:20.986
release of that report, which never came. And what 
eventually happened is that for better or worse,

23:22.007 --> 23:29.916
the report was boxed up and put back in storage. It 
has always been the intention or at least Mr.

23:34.848 --> 23:41.117
McLendon was told, that we want to eventually 
release the report. We want to handle it in our own

23:41.217 --> 23:45.944
time frame and as delicately as possible. I don't 
believe it was ever the intention to pigeonhole

23:46.565 --> 23:50.271
the report so no one could see it. It wasn't that 
damage to the report, but it was very aggressive.

23:54.016 --> 24:04.011
And it did set some long-range goals and 
commendable goals, but it's also some very, very

23:54.016 --> 24:04.011
strong objectives.

24:05.678 --> 24:18.313
With your new city manager now, is there any effort 
being made to conduct a review of that at the

24:05.678 --> 24:18.313
planning commission level? Well, you have to 
understand that the new city manager has only been

24:19.415 --> 24:34.673
here several months, and at this moment, although 
he seems to be an extremely sharp individual,

24:19.415 --> 24:34.673
which he is, the reason he was hired, you could well 
understand that what he's doing now is letting

24:35.345 --> 24:44.497
things run as they had been under the leadership of 
people that were in charge prior to Mr. Townsend.

24:44.778 --> 25:02.922
And we did go through another major 
reorganization under Townsend prior to his

24:44.778 --> 25:02.922
departure, where before we had city manager 
Marvin Townsend, assistant city manager, and

24:44.778 --> 25:02.922
then four major department heads in charge of what 
I call super departments. The new reorganization

25:03.543 --> 25:16.281
effective down last year, we created that we had 
city manager, deputy city manager, which Mr.

25:03.543 --> 25:16.281
Briones was elevated to deputy city manager, and 
four assistant city managers. And these

25:17.483 --> 25:25.154
assistant city managers, this organizational 
structure was in place, although very new, at the

25:17.483 --> 25:25.154
time Mr. Martin, our new city manager, came on 
board. And understandably, as I said earlier,

25:26.035 --> 25:31.002
he's just going to sort of watch over things, 
monitor it. He's made some critical decisions. We

25:35.537 --> 25:41.589
have no feedback yet on what his feelings are about 
planning. But I think after he's been there for

25:42.290 --> 25:49.885
maybe six months to maybe a year, that he will start 
bringing his own personal style of management And

25:50.236 --> 25:54.860
I believe we'll see very shortly what his thoughts 
are on planning. And of course, we keep our fingers

25:54.921 --> 26:03.409
crossed as to hoping that he would allow us to move 
forward in this direction. At this time, Mr.

26:03.569 --> 26:13.699
Martin probably does not know or is not aware that 
there is a housing element tucked away back in the

26:03.569 --> 26:13.699
back somewhere.

26:13.719 --> 26:15.561
And he may or may not be impressed with it. I don't 
know. It's hard to say. But in the meantime, this

26:17.342 --> 26:20.125
department seeing as what happened to other 
planters. It's very important to understand that

26:22.475 --> 26:29.562
what Bruce and what Linus and what the Kern Ewings 
all tried to do was extremely commendable. It was

26:29.622 --> 26:30.943
done very well. And it was done, for the most part, a 
losing cause. And the only people who lose,

26:35.508 --> 26:42.094
really, is the city and the planning department, 
our own goals. Mr. McLendon had since left and went

26:46.126 --> 26:53.415
become director of planning at Galveston, and now 
he's currently the director of planning of the

26:46.126 --> 26:53.415
city of Beaumont. And Linda Jamison left, and she 
got a much higher paying position with the city of

26:53.435 --> 27:02.686
Kansas, Kansas City, and she's doing extremely 
well. But the real losers is the city, and I think we

27:05.349 --> 27:14.260
as planners are trying to do more of Well, we're 
going to try another approach. You've got to keep

27:17.231 --> 27:18.132
trying. And this time it's a little bit more 
low-key. We're not pressing long-range

27:21.858 --> 27:24.141
planning. We are implying it. We're bringing it in 
slowly. This department and our staff have become

27:27.606 --> 27:31.412
very responsive to short-range needs. We have 
taken our emphasis on long-range planning and

27:32.414 --> 27:36.620
applied it to the neighborhoods. We do not use a 
2,000-year plan. or a 2002-year plan, a 20-year

27:43.417 --> 27:45.940
plan. We don't go by that anymore. We have an 
ultimate plan. And we have five-year

27:48.803 --> 27:52.047
improvements, priorities. And so in one sense, 
what is the ultimate plan? An ultimate plan is what

27:57.032 --> 28:01.998
our concept of what the city is going to look like 
when it's ultimately developed. Where is this

28:02.438 --> 28:05.702
plan housed? This plan happens to be compromise to 
the unified summary prepared by your class. It was

28:15.373 --> 28:17.937
our way of saving it. And what we have done, we have 
calculated out all the different types of land

28:17.957 --> 28:26.809
uses and impacts it would have on the city's growth 
if they should be developed. We've incorporated

28:27.129 --> 28:33.437
into it densities, housing densities that we 
need, commercial properties, etc. And we've also

28:34.018 --> 28:39.225
go back into using, we've done this under the 
auspices of the transportation plan again

28:34.018 --> 28:39.225
because One of the things we're required to do in 
order to continue highway improvements is to

28:39.543 --> 28:44.672
maintain the 20-year plan. So we have to do our 
traffic assignments for the year 2000. Where is

28:47.597 --> 28:49.841
this ultimate plan? Well, the ultimate plan is 
about 50% through, and we've done it by planning

28:49.862 --> 28:55.712
area. as El Paso did, and Kern, you know, since Kern 
came from El Paso and I came from El Paso, we set up

28:55.827 --> 29:13.414
the city in basically five planning areas, and we 
worked primarily in the two planning areas that

28:55.827 --> 29:13.414
were most critical, most of, you know, the ones 
that were subjected to the most growth, and that's

28:55.827 --> 29:13.414
the northwest planning area and the southeast 
planning area. We have at this point nothing

29:14.075 --> 29:19.423
published, but we do have all of our 
documentations and materials. That's not in

29:19.483 --> 29:20.665
there. No, this here is our transportation study 
area with our traffic zones. And these are our

29:31.526 --> 29:34.009
sectors. And although this really does not relate 
to our planning area. Well, the name Ultimate Plan

29:41.739 --> 29:51.210
fascinates me because it is unique in the animals 
and plants to have a document called Ultimate.

29:51.230 --> 29:52.632
That I find interesting. We may find it more 
interesting than you think after we get caught up

29:53.270 --> 29:58.617
with the language. It's a word selection game, 
really. Ultimate seems to be more acceptable to

30:02.822 --> 30:13.176
other people than, let's say, a plan that says 1980 
or 1990 plan. A lot of people are still afraid, as

30:13.756 --> 30:22.888
far as from the administrator's point of view, 
that a plan implies a commitment to do certain

30:13.756 --> 30:22.888
things. That's why in my classes now, I encourage 
the students to think in terms of horizons that are

30:23.307 --> 30:34.083
not time horizons, but population horizons. 
Well, exactly. And if you have X people, then you

30:36.586 --> 30:40.352
have this sort of thing happening. We reject in the 
Corpus Christi area. Well, we do have some

30:43.076 --> 30:47.322
rejections that carry us through 20 years. 
346,000 by the year 2000. we use that kind of

30:52.045 --> 31:06.799
population target to identify the kinds of 
services will be needed to address those

30:52.045 --> 31:06.799
population needs. But the timing is very 
flexible, and it's of very little consequence.

31:13.705 --> 31:21.192
One of the things we accomplished, and I think this 
is interesting, and I don't know if we have

31:13.705 --> 31:21.192
compromised our own
