00:02.663 --> 00:13.694
William's years, what were the major 
accomplishments,

00:02.663 --> 00:13.694
the major changes?

00:17.037 --> 00:20.000
Of all the changes that I saw, what were the major 
changes?

00:22.863 --> 00:32.232
Well, of course, on Rudder, in Rudder's time, I'd 
have to rank the coeducation military,

00:22.863 --> 00:32.232
non-military, as the primary changes there. One

00:32.937 --> 00:50.523
other minor change which goes unnoticed I think 
sometimes is the amount of money we spent on making

00:32.937 --> 00:50.523
the whole campus wheelchair accessible. Not much 
was said about that, but I watched that. It was

00:55.230 --> 00:56.392
interesting. Especially watching the academic 
buildings where They went to great pains to build a

00:59.043 --> 01:07.131
ramp that had exactly the same architecture that 
the building involved. I thought that was the

01:07.151 --> 01:16.419
highest sensibility

01:07.151 --> 01:16.419
on the map. That's the rudder years. I see that as 
being really...

01:19.082 --> 01:26.128
What about the Williams years? Williams years... 
Now somebody else had to start, just below him,

01:29.519 --> 01:41.198
start pulling the academic strings and making 
academia more visible, more respectable, and

01:29.519 --> 01:41.198
everything like that. Who do you think did that? I 
have to give him credit, but I'm not sure. It may

01:45.465 --> 01:48.169
have even started down the rudder. but I know 
Rudder is the one who appointed Bob Logan. He said,

01:51.580 --> 01:57.930
you get all the stuff on the whole campus that has to 
do with scholarship in one place, and you do it now.

01:57.950 --> 02:01.196
Not a bunch of deans do it, you do it. That started 
there in his, probably his last couple of years or

02:01.216 --> 02:06.845
so. Then I'd have to say Williams probably 
continued that way again. Because that has been a,

02:15.132 --> 02:16.794
been a watermark for the university. I take people 
in and show them those plaques in the student

02:16.875 --> 02:27.631
center, and the number of endowed scholarship, 
they just gobble

02:16.875 --> 02:27.631
it up.

02:31.176 --> 02:39.829
I think the Rutter Tower, which is built after 
Rutter, of course, and that complex there is a

02:31.176 --> 02:39.829
major event. That ball, that may have started 
going before, but it was finished in his

02:44.022 --> 02:55.454
administration and began to be used, and I think 
that furnished sort of a focal point for a lot of

02:44.022 --> 02:55.454
stuff. But I don't really know any specific 
incidents about Williams' time as much as I know

02:55.474 --> 03:05.265
about Rudder's time. It's more spectacular, I 
guess, than his, but there just seemed to be a

03:05.945 --> 03:13.033
general atmosphere a pervasive academic 
atmosphere which was in those last years there.

03:18.562 --> 03:22.146
Did you have any feel about any changes in student 
quality? Oh yeah, we saw that. Once again, that

03:26.911 --> 03:37.182
started in Rudder's years, but was enhanced down 
the line there.

03:37.752 --> 03:42.137
in the counseling center, counseling and testing 
center back in the old days. And we had charge of

03:42.237 --> 03:45.020
doing all the testing on the campus. When I came in 
61, they were not using the SAT or the ACT tests.

03:52.347 --> 04:00.456
They were using the old American College of 
Education, Council of Education test, which was

03:52.347 --> 04:00.456
completely outdated and everything. But they're 
using it because of their system of pre-week

04:00.476 --> 04:07.523
enrollment. freshman week there, when they 
brought everybody in and gave them the test all in

04:08.330 --> 04:17.722
one pile and got the test results out and the 
advising done all in one week's time. Come out of

04:17.742 --> 04:20.926
that freshman, even with corporate and stuff like 
that. And they couldn't get, as I understand it,

04:22.328 --> 04:27.715
they couldn't get Educational Testing Service to 
go along with that. So,

04:28.856 --> 04:33.983
for the fall of 62, We got them to do, we did what they 
call a validation study of the SAT and had 2,000

04:34.975 --> 04:47.156
students that year come in. We took the SAT and ran 
the norms, compared to the national norm and all

04:47.176 --> 04:50.942
stuff like that. Then the next year the board voted 
to require the SAT. Our enrollment dropped to

04:57.493 --> 04:59.076
1,300. Everybody scared of the test, and 
everybody wanted to come where it wasn't

05:01.250 --> 05:04.355
required. And

05:04.395 --> 05:09.723
we got our base norm that year. And from that year 
on, it went up steadily from then on.

05:20.018 --> 05:26.267
And the academic, it's hard to put your finger on 
what caused the improvement. Maybe it took five or

05:27.549 --> 05:30.413
six years for that to really sink in. kind of thing. 
That we were really a class act from now on. Funny

05:39.322 --> 05:41.424
thing, they did the same thing with the graduate 
school. I don't know whether I ever told you this or

05:41.444 --> 05:43.147
not. We administered the GRE to two years of 
graduating seniors. Paid for it ourselves. They

05:52.478 --> 05:53.980
paid for it. It was called Institutional 
Administration. And it was before we started

05:57.324 --> 05:59.607
requiring the GRE. And we ran those norms, and it 
was so interesting because the university level

06:01.055 --> 06:22.581
of achievement, the verbal score was highest in 
the Department of History. The math score was

06:22.601 --> 06:28.969
highest in the whole college of engineering at the 
figures.

06:30.502 --> 06:39.089
But the highest department in the whole place on 
the Achievement Test, not the Aptitude Test, but

06:30.502 --> 06:39.089
the Achievement Test was the Department of 
Economics. Did you know that? I knew. 95th

06:41.011 --> 06:42.692
percentile rank on national norms. How good. Al 
Chalk had done his work well. The lowest

06:46.836 --> 06:49.558
department was mathematics. Fifth percentile 
rank on national norms. And how important

06:54.683 --> 06:58.046
mathematics is to a science and engineering 
institution. Well, they'd been teaching. He's

07:00.623 --> 07:04.588
doing mathematics for years. Well, see Rudder and 
the boy Rudder, I have to give him credit for this,

07:04.608 --> 07:19.106
because he found the money to give a lot of money to 
math and brought in some high-powered math

07:04.608 --> 07:19.106
people. I don't remember their names right now, 
some of them weren't so hot, but they were used to

07:19.667 --> 07:29.820
academia and they got a big pay for a year or two to 
put their course on a video tape. really

07:30.442 --> 07:31.383
successful. And, but guess who he gave a lot of 
money to also? The best department, Al Chong. Got a

07:40.872 --> 07:42.894
lot of money for him. And that's when it started 
going up. But it takes a few years for that to seep on

07:48.139 --> 07:56.027
down and take effect only down in the Williams 
years, I think. All right, now then in 1970 Dr.

07:58.555 --> 08:06.486
Williams replaces Rutter. Then in 1976 Dr. 
Williams has a heart attack, almost fatal, not

08:06.626 --> 08:15.718
quite, replaced by Dr. Miller. Who was the dean in 
education following Hubert?

08:25.492 --> 08:27.094
Following Hubert was Corrigan.

08:33.038 --> 08:40.086
He didn't get here till 80 because I was the 
chairman of the committee that selected him.

08:40.106 --> 08:43.530
Well, Limbacher was interim dean after Hubert. 
Okay. And they selected another dean at that time.

08:49.777 --> 08:51.378
My mind's blank right now. All right, does Hubert, 
Hubert becomes chancellor in the late 70s? Yeah.

09:00.221 --> 09:01.762
Okay, so maybe, maybe. You said you became 
chancellor the same year that Miller was

09:02.283 --> 09:06.147
president. Yeah, all right, and you remain active 
until you retire what year? 86. 86. Okay, let's

09:14.137 --> 09:17.120
talk about Dean Carrigan then. Describe him as 
dean. Thorough scholar, and he was good for the

09:20.884 --> 09:28.333
college.

09:33.022 --> 09:38.029
He didn't, he brought a national reputation with 
him.

09:42.656 --> 09:47.544
And he immediately attracted the attention of the 
governor, who put him on the governor's special

09:42.656 --> 09:47.544
committee. And he's got some tales to tell about 
that. You may want to talk to him about that. But he

09:55.916 --> 10:00.683
was the only educator on that whole committee of 25 
people. And Ross Perot was up in all these

10:01.152 --> 10:06.737
coattails all the time. But he had some 
interesting tales to tell there. Really, I

10:10.561 --> 10:11.802
believe he was. I can't recall the dean before Dean 
Cardin. He stayed nine years, didn't he? Did he

10:18.488 --> 10:25.775
relate well to the education and statewide? 
Statewide, as far as I know, he related well with

10:26.115 --> 10:30.940
them. All right, at the time you retired then, 
where would you have placed Texas A&M's education

10:31.426 --> 10:44.825
program in the state, qualitatively? That's a 
toughie.

10:48.551 --> 10:54.940
I was minimally involved in teacher training, but 
I had an interest in it all the time. I taught one

10:55.020 --> 10:59.847
course over there, adolescent psychology, all 
the time. I didn't have a chance to really talk with

11:00.248 --> 11:05.556
other people at other institutions. I have to go a 
little bit on reputation there, but I think we were

11:05.576 --> 11:22.543
better than Texas Tech and North Texas and San 
Marcos and others.

11:25.122 --> 11:28.687
Commerce and Huntsville come up pretty high on my 
books. University of Houston, not so well. I

11:33.354 --> 11:37.459
didn't think their teacher prep down there was all 
that good. But that's what I hear from it. All

11:41.805 --> 11:43.668
right, what about UT? Where were we compared to 
Austin?

11:50.377 --> 11:51.639
Equal to or better. Oh, OK. So we, in your opinion, 
we were clearly one of the best, if not the best.

11:58.536 --> 11:58.916
Okay. Texas Tech had a strange system out there. I 
never understood exactly what it was. They

12:07.427 --> 12:08.589
refused to have departments. They called them 
areas of emphasis out there. And I didn't hear much

12:11.893 --> 12:15.818
out of that, good or bad. But I always wondered how 
they got by with departing from the usual

12:16.321 --> 12:24.389
structure that we have and working within the 
system. Let's look back. Can you think of any, in

12:25.170 --> 12:33.478
hindsight, any mistakes that were made of action 
or inaction?

12:37.562 --> 12:37.743
Here. Yes. Here. Action or inaction. There were 
things we did that turned out not to be

12:44.047 --> 12:47.892
well-advised are things that we failed to do that 
we could have done. I didn't think the consortium

12:47.912 --> 12:55.901
finally faded from the scene, just like 
performance-based education. The consortium

12:56.602 --> 13:05.953
between the local school superintendent, the 
Texas University, and the education service

13:07.030 --> 13:08.892
centers. I thought that wasn't entirely our 
doing. But I thought that idea was not so hot.

13:20.524 --> 13:23.647
And areas of omission. Are there some things we've 
just simply failed to... Well, partly from

13:25.970 --> 13:33.898
personal experience And this little project I did 
on going out and evaluating what they thought,

13:34.317 --> 13:43.508
well, not enough classroom management, how to 
handle tough kids. I had an Aggie come back to

13:44.509 --> 13:52.619
school from East Houston after having taught here 
in East Houston in seventh grade. And she was a

13:54.181 --> 13:58.066
battle fatigue case. They put her into a seventh 
grade classroom, little slums down there. didn't

14:02.178 --> 14:15.815
give her any support, and so I think the lack of 
preparation for the real world of teaching is

14:02.178 --> 14:15.815
where I think they've fallen short, may still be 
falling short. They teach them to go out, yes, into

14:15.835 --> 14:22.824
a nice small size, middle size, western rural 
area. Don't have a lot of racial, social upheaval

14:24.547 --> 14:30.134
going on. They do all right out there, but If we're 
supposed to be preparing for East Dallas, South

14:32.384 --> 14:41.255
Dallas, and East Houston, I think we're failing 
there.

14:43.017 --> 14:50.086
People that you now, as you look back on, that you 
would want to pat them on the back if you could? John

14:52.489 --> 14:53.010
Barker. Why? Because he said, I'm willing to serve 
anywhere that anybody asks me. I'll do it until I

14:59.978 --> 15:01.260
drop it. He never, and because at certain crucial 
moments in faculty meetings, this man spoke up and

15:02.202 --> 15:15.419
said the things that some of us didn't have the guts 
to stand up and say. And he was in your department?

15:17.161 --> 15:18.583
Yeah, educational psychology.

15:21.547 --> 15:21.647
Okay. Yeah. And he'd been there since the year 
before I came. He took a full-time teaching job.

15:31.379 --> 15:36.728
Which, by the way, I had also interviewed for that 
job and decided I would not take it. I wasn't ready

15:37.229 --> 15:38.711
yet. And Frank Hubert interviewed me. Who else in 
addition to Berker that you would

15:40.374 --> 15:48.106
pat on the back, commend?

15:50.871 --> 15:56.560
I think, unsung,

15:50.871 --> 15:56.560
Chris Borland.

15:59.510 --> 16:05.097
He went on to be dean at UT San Antonio. He doesn't 
get much credit for doing what he did here.

16:14.249 --> 16:19.476
I'm not, I don't have to mention Williams and 
Rutter anymore. I'm talking about other people

16:19.556 --> 16:27.947
who gave their whole life to this place and really 
need a pat on the back for it. I think Chris Gromlin

16:28.552 --> 16:32.477
did, before he died. Walter Varble.

16:38.185 --> 16:39.346
He was in psychology? He was in psychology, but he 
taught the education for me, just like everybody

16:39.486 --> 16:43.472
else. I have to tell you a little bit about him. This 
illustrates some past history that I wasn't here

16:47.197 --> 16:55.167
to observe, but I know about it because Varble told 
me all that, and the way things came about. He was

16:55.754 --> 17:01.281
brought here in 1939 to head the psychology 
department.

17:01.301 --> 17:03.223
Brand new PhD out of Kansas. But before they got 
into reorganization, things were going a little

17:05.626 --> 17:10.332
bit slow then in war camp. So he ended up teaching 
algebra and trigonometry throughout the war to

17:11.313 --> 17:19.904
ASTP people. And then the president, after the 
war, was not in favor of psychology. So we didn't

17:24.458 --> 17:27.782
have a psychology department. Well, finally, 
they got preparatory to becoming a college of

17:27.802 --> 17:34.569
education, a college of liberal arts. They 
decided to form a department of psychology, apart

17:34.589 --> 17:43.038
from department of educational psychology, or 
department of education, it was then. Split the

17:44.359 --> 17:44.840
two. So they did a national search for a department 
head. Barman, in 1965, as long as that, a few 25

17:53.517 --> 17:58.564
years after he was chairman of the search 
committee. They brought three people to the

17:59.666 --> 18:03.751
campus and they all turned it down. Then the 
university, the board, whoever. Well, Dr.

18:10.341 --> 18:12.163
Barber, how about you be the department head? He 
told them to go to hell.

18:19.594 --> 18:22.798
And to their everlasting shame, misfortune they 
got Clesson Martin.

18:29.332 --> 18:36.663
I'd

18:29.332 --> 18:36.663
have to go off camera before I talk very much about 
Clesson Martin. He didn't do the university any

18:36.723 --> 18:41.751
good, really. That's a long story. Let's see, any 
staff people that you would want to pat on the back,

18:42.772 --> 18:51.165
special folks?

18:55.516 --> 19:02.246
Yeah,

18:55.516 --> 19:02.246
I'd say Austin Curley.

19:06.172 --> 19:07.213
Leading question, why? Well, same reason he 
served,

19:08.415 --> 19:16.808
because somebody said do it. He was the man on the 
spot and they said do it. But he was putting in

19:21.375 --> 19:25.000
another possible situation when they They'd take 
a master's degree guy and give him a position which

19:26.617 --> 19:34.608
had been held by a dean and decimate the college. 
And he stayed and kept it together for 15 years

19:35.790 --> 19:39.916
after that. And did some of the good things we just 
talked about, the testing program and stuff like

19:40.857 --> 19:46.706
that. And

19:48.128 --> 19:54.497
he served on the committee for, did I know them? of 
the Rutter Tower and all that stuff. He was on the

19:57.331 --> 20:01.136
study committee that did that. Yeah, I'd say 
Austin, they made him Emeritus, Emeritus

20:02.677 --> 20:08.665
Director of Counseling and Testing Center. I 
don't know whether that includes being Emeritus

20:10.107 --> 20:16.835
in the department or not, but at least they kept the 
hat to him for that.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.303
Let me think about that for a minute.

20:30.607 --> 20:48.908
I should have asked quite ago, do you remember any 
change in manner or style of classes with women now

20:30.607 --> 20:48.908
in the class and or minority students? Do you 
remember any incidents? Yes. Peggy was going to

20:55.970 --> 21:04.481
school when, and you may want to interview her some 
other time on that, she was in class with, before

20:55.970 --> 21:04.481
women were admitted.

21:06.203 --> 21:13.253
And there was some minor harassment involved 
there in the language lab and stuff like that.

21:14.594 --> 21:21.383
Nothing you really put your finger on, but it was 
obvious that they still were a good Aggie boy to do

21:14.594 --> 21:21.383
that kind of thing.

21:24.788 --> 21:25.048
Yeah. Do you remember any racial incidents of any 
sort? No racial incidents.

21:35.987 --> 21:44.156
There's some subtle attitudes, which I saw from 
time to time on faculty and students' parts. You

21:44.236 --> 21:53.926
weren't, by chance, teaching a summer session 
that first summer that black students were

21:44.236 --> 21:53.926
enrolled?

21:53.946 --> 21:54.567
No. No, it wasn't. Because I knew nothing about 
that going to happen right then until the

21:56.298 --> 22:08.471
announcement at the end of the first day of classes 
that that day black students had attended class.

22:09.192 --> 22:11.754
And I never heard of a single incident at all. I 
heard it

22:11.834 --> 22:17.180
was only positive. Art,

22:17.580 --> 22:23.807
do you agree with me this way? In those years before 
coeducation and integration, I felt that there

22:24.783 --> 22:46.312
was not any divisiveness in the student body over 
national background or anything that you were

22:24.783 --> 22:46.312
either an Aggie or you weren't an Aggie, that your 
nickname might indicate your ancestry. But that

22:46.752 --> 22:51.178
was just part of the fact that faculty members had a 
nickname too. Austin Curley told me that as a

22:52.508 --> 22:58.274
student here in 35, he had two Mexican-American 
school roommates. Didn't make a big difference to

23:00.036 --> 23:01.317
him. That's the impression I have. In fact, he 
still keeps up with some of those people. Were

23:07.384 --> 23:11.168
there still nicknames for faculty in education 
when you got here? What were some of them? I didn't

23:12.570 --> 23:13.190
know. I didn't know what they were. I knew about 
screaming out. But I didn't hear any nicknames

23:17.375 --> 23:19.497
over our way. There weren't any over there? There 
must not have been, or I wouldn't have heard of

23:20.498 --> 23:22.380
them. let's see now a while ago we were you didn't 
have think of any decisions of omission omission

23:22.715 --> 23:50.477
during these years omission which they should 
have done and I should have done and now in

23:22.715 --> 23:50.477
hindsight I

23:22.715 --> 23:50.477
get the impression this I don't know from personal 
observation but The regular military faculty, I

23:51.335 --> 24:04.976
think, I get the impression that they did not do all 
they needed to do to help either integration or

23:51.335 --> 24:04.976
core education. Anyway, over there, or core 
education. That's my impression of it. They all,

24:10.765 --> 24:18.878
service academies all did it before us. and been 
announced as national policy from way back. And

24:23.718 --> 24:40.042
being a part of a major institution, I thought even 
though they were most of them Aggies and they

24:23.718 --> 24:40.042
wanted to uphold their Aggie traditions, it seems 
to me that they could have done more than they did

24:23.718 --> 24:40.042
over there. All right, we're getting close to the 
end now. Any anecdotes you want to share? I'll

24:45.453 --> 24:47.477
think of them after you leave. I reserve the right 
to tell you after this. What are some of your

24:52.407 --> 24:54.392
favorite Aggie stories? I guess one of them, while 
I was still at Baylor, we had a basketball game on

24:56.877 --> 25:05.655
campus before the students came back to campus up 
there. And Aggies do seem to do the fucking place,

25:06.901 --> 25:12.709
even in the holidays, to see the baseball game. 
This must have been mid-50s, somewhere back in

25:12.729 --> 25:15.593
there. And they had a riot over at the gymnasium. I 
mean, of course, I was the dorm director living on

25:18.237 --> 25:29.592
the campus, and me and the other director peeled 
out of there and went over to the gymnasium and

25:18.237 --> 25:29.592
started trying to close the park. And I hear 
somebody slugging somebody else, and one said,

25:29.612 --> 25:35.440
hey, don't hit me, I'm an Aggie too. He couldn't 
tell who was who. He said, I'm an Aggie too, don't

25:39.669 --> 25:43.313
hit me. That's the honest truth. That happened out 
there in front of the gymnasium on the campus of

25:44.354 --> 25:49.360
Baylor.

25:51.943 --> 25:59.050
We had the Baylor students guarding the campus up 
there from the Aggies before they bailed. And they

25:59.070 --> 26:00.452
had that game every year. And they built fires on 
the corners.

26:06.875 --> 26:11.979
One carload of Aggies had been roughed up quite a 
bit. We brought them into the apartment there and

26:11.999 --> 26:20.527
gave them coffee and settled them down and sent 
them on their way. That was my first contact with

26:20.547 --> 26:23.869
one of the greater Aggies while I was still a 
player. That's absurd. Of course, all the time,

26:26.752 --> 26:32.156
you remember in those years, an Aggie with a 
uniform didn't have to have wheels. He could

26:32.757 --> 26:36.460
hitchhike anywhere in the state of Texas and no 
problem. And I've not yet had a single, in all the

26:36.727 --> 26:45.040
conversations I've had, I've not yet heard a 
single horror story of Aggie hitchhiking. They

26:45.060 --> 26:46.762
all say it went well, went well. Let's see, in 
class, some Aggie fun stories from class.

26:57.959 --> 27:00.743
I'll have to take a rain check. Aggie excuses. Oh, 
Aggie excuses, yeah. I've heard some of the better

27:08.519 --> 27:13.706
ones that overshadow all of mine from a daughter, 
Chris. She shares all of her excuses with me these

27:14.527 --> 27:17.551
days. So I'm completely, but I reserve, I want to 
come back and tell her. Tell her she ought to put

27:21.436 --> 27:23.418
those on tape. You know, just pick out the machine 
and put it. Some letters. Yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. All

27:28.585 --> 27:30.588
right, you can butt in one time. You'd been 
teaching Monday, Wednesday practice. Yeah. And

27:34.372 --> 27:37.056
suddenly you got assigned one Tuesday, Thursday. 
Yeah. And you went on

27:37.932 --> 27:47.245
Wednesday

27:37.932 --> 27:47.245
and forgot to go on Thursday. And then didn't have a 
meeting, but something happened that you weren't

27:48.606 --> 27:52.131
there on Friday. When you went back on Monday, you 
said, well, how long did you wait till I come? And he

27:57.578 --> 28:06.150
was going to go into the joke about with an 
instructor, you wait 10 minutes, and with an

27:57.578 --> 28:06.150
assistant professor, 15, associate, 30, and a 
full professor, one hour. He said, how long did you

28:06.637 --> 28:07.960
wait? And a voice came up from the back saying, I've 
been here since then. Oh, that's good. That's

28:15.494 --> 28:16.135
good. All right. Then the last, what parts of the 
institution are dearest in your heart?

28:27.297 --> 28:27.757
Oh, that's a tough one. I guess...

28:41.197 --> 28:44.161
I'd like to say it to the conductor, but I guess I 
can't say that. I say that because I like the

28:44.742 --> 28:50.750
citizen-soldier idea so much. That's the reason I 
almost give them the vote. But I guess the feeling

28:53.734 --> 29:05.310
of camaraderie that I have seen in graduate 
students in my department is the most heartening

28:53.734 --> 29:05.310
thing I have seen. It is different from other 
institutions. In other words, a cohort group

29:08.669 --> 29:16.798
comes in, 10, 12 people in one year, and they stay 
together for life, just like the Aggies do. They,

29:16.818 --> 29:18.701
in professional life afterwards, they're there. 
And I think I have to give some credit to that, the

29:20.002 --> 29:24.788
continuity of the faculty. We had the same five 
faculty members. Who were they? Roach, Riley,

29:32.076 --> 29:37.242
Pope, Barman, and Smith.

29:41.626 --> 29:43.689
Y'all came about the same time. All came about the 
same time, late 60s or early 70s. And stayed? Well,

29:49.018 --> 29:55.368
I'm nobody there now. No, but all stayed pretty 
well until retirement. All stayed for 20 years,

29:57.652 --> 30:00.256
yeah. And in that time is when we had this 
camaraderie with the graduate students. They

30:05.892 --> 30:09.996
would pass on their apartment to the next people to 
come in, just like the vet school does. And they had

30:10.316 --> 30:16.302
a few bucks for somebody who needed help, money 
wise. And they covered, sometimes not widely, for

30:16.723 --> 30:25.471
their fellow students from time to time. Any 
extracurricular parts of the institution that

30:26.032 --> 30:31.637
are deep in your heart? I like the athletics. I like 
the, I think spectator sports, mass spectator

30:35.609 --> 30:44.559
sports serves a useful purpose, especially as 
practiced here. You see, no other institution

30:44.960 --> 30:53.810
that I know of has the control of the student body as 
these students do. The yell leaders here and the

30:53.830 --> 31:00.338
core here has control of the crowd and everything 
else. It's a riot at other places. Look at the

31:04.735 --> 31:08.642
international scene in hockey and stuff like 
that. And by no means do we approach that in other

31:08.702 --> 31:14.333
schools here, but I think A&M is superb. And if 
there's ever evidence of sort of undergrowth and

31:14.413 --> 31:28.279
undergirding of a custom, worthwhile custom, 
it's that that's been perpetuated.
