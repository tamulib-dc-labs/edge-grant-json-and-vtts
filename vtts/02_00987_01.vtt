00:14.375 --> 00:28.596
Today

00:14.375 --> 00:28.596
it is my privilege to interview Mr. Ching Hing, 
former president of the Republic of Cambodia.

00:29.677 --> 00:33.262
Sir, would you please briefly summarize your 
early years? Yeah. When I finished high school in

00:37.949 --> 00:54.220
my country, I went to the college and I got my law 
diploma about 1940.

00:59.363 --> 01:03.028
Where did you actually receive your higher 
education? What college? In Cambodia. And your

01:07.314 --> 01:09.637
father was? My father was a farmer and a mayor in my 
country. A mayor and a farmer.

01:29.063 --> 01:34.686
What business interests did you pursue prior to 
entering politics?

01:59.506 --> 02:26.391
At

01:59.506 --> 02:26.391
that time, I thought When I enter in politics, I can 
help more. I have more means to help people because

02:32.516 --> 02:40.626
I'm like agriculture, you know? Okay.

02:46.033 --> 02:50.558
So your motivation to enter politics was helping 
the people? Yeah. Okay. How... Did you find it

02:53.582 --> 02:55.905
hard? to come from your background and work your 
way all the way up to working in politics. Was that

03:04.327 --> 03:07.511
unusual in Cambodia? Is there a strict class 
system in Cambodia that would make that hard? No,

03:13.458 --> 03:14.739
no. No? We don't have any . OK. And about the 
politics, you asked me what party, and that time we

03:20.827 --> 03:32.015
have only unique party, one party. Yes, sir. Yeah. 
Was it called the Democratic Party? No, it's a

03:38.934 --> 03:42.719
national party. They have to compete

03:43.219 --> 03:54.232
themselves, not about the right, the party. Who 
was looked upon as the leader of that party? Was

03:59.678 --> 04:02.081
there any one person who? At that time, it was . And 
he was king at that time also. Yes, he was king.

04:09.339 --> 04:18.431
After that, he uptake from king to be a chef of the 
party, unique party. It

04:18.451 --> 04:29.886
is an extraordinary achievement to rise to the 
presidency of one's country. To what do you credit

04:30.387 --> 04:33.831
your success to?

04:55.748 --> 05:22.228
In America,

04:55.748 --> 05:22.228
if somebody rises to such a height of success, 
where they have such a great influence and

04:55.748 --> 05:22.228
importance on their country, then we want to know 
how they think they got there, if it was through

05:22.664 --> 05:42.478
background of their parents, or if it was through 
education, or if it was some personal values that

05:22.664 --> 05:42.478
they had that they felt helped them to get that far. 
You know, I never had the ambition to be the

05:44.264 --> 06:08.247
president, you know, because my country was

05:44.264 --> 06:08.247
the kingdom, you know. In the politics, we can 
promote to the president of the National

06:08.227 --> 06:18.560
Assembly, like I let you know. We have to 
participate in elections. And at that time, the

06:24.608 --> 06:37.845
people know me, I was very popular in agriculture, 
because my country relies on agriculture. Now I

06:38.821 --> 06:58.991
would like to be president of the National 
Assembly because the people push me to be that

06:38.821 --> 06:58.991
president because they know and they fund the 
price of the grain, the produce, as we call it in my

06:38.821 --> 06:58.991
country. I help the people,

06:59.012 --> 07:05.301
you know. protest against the price of fertilizer 
too high. and the low price of the rice, you know.

07:19.069 --> 07:22.734
And the people, you know, I had a lot. From zero, I 
made a lot of propaganda to explain to the people to

07:22.754 --> 07:35.293
buy tractor, to flow, you know. Before my country 
fell, we had about 5,000 tractor. You know, but

07:41.562 --> 07:44.687
before, For one hectare, the ground to flow, it

07:45.089 --> 07:59.826
takes very long, you know? And because they use 
oxygen, you know, to flow. And with tractor, they

08:07.575 --> 08:10.479
flow very fast. It takes, before, by oxygen, It 
takes five years to finish a boat. One on a guitar,

08:16.714 --> 08:20.619
you know? Because a lot of grass, a lot of bushes or 
something, you know? And with tractor, they flow

08:26.887 --> 08:30.512
very fast. They work fast. And the production 
increase. And the peasants was very happy, you

08:35.258 --> 08:39.623
know? And they push me to be... President, you 
know, of the Assembly National. So popular

08:47.431 --> 09:00.118
opinion is what, and your help in agriculture and 
helping the people is what made them like you so

08:47.431 --> 09:00.118
much. I'm a son of a peasant. I'm a farmer myself, 
and I know the problem for the farmer, you know?

09:11.289 --> 09:11.870
Right. And I help them to the right way, you know? 
Was it uncommon for the

09:19.322 --> 09:27.675
Prince Sinahook Was he not a people's person?

09:33.695 --> 09:45.888
Were the people looking more for somebody to lead 
them closer?

09:45.968 --> 09:53.477
Were

09:45.968 --> 09:53.477
the people looking for someone to help them more? 
personally? Was the government at that time

09:56.077 --> 10:00.023
insufficient at helping the villagers? Yeah, you 
know, I'd like to know. When Ren Hsien Loong, he

10:02.446 --> 10:10.919
time he challenged the government, he asked me to 
be an agricultor, you know. He know, he said, you

10:10.939 --> 10:16.107
know, I have experience in agriculture. Because 
not only I have experience, but I study a lot. I

10:22.586 --> 10:24.528
travel a lot. Because I would like to improve the 
economy of my country. Not only we stay on

10:33.419 --> 10:45.334
agriculture, but I explain to my people, you have 
to prepare to grow. of the plant we can use in the

10:45.668 --> 10:58.550
industry before we go to another set, you know, 
because to industrialize the country. And that

10:59.071 --> 11:10.630
time I bought the seed from other country for 
cotton from here. And sugarcane plant from other

11:11.437 --> 11:16.089
country, you know. And coffee from Brazilian. And 
it fit well in my country. And they are very happy.

11:28.722 --> 11:32.066
And we try to modernize the agriculture. We have a 
lot, a lot of orange, but traditional, you know. We

11:38.314 --> 11:46.885
send to study here or to in Europe, you know, to try 
to tell the people. And that use method of

11:48.387 --> 11:55.416
selection, modernization, you know. We had a lot 
of people. Like, you know, before you grow mango or

11:58.096 --> 12:08.989
you grow coconut, it takes about 10 years to have 
fruits. With modern system, you know, on eight

12:09.429 --> 12:14.275
months, you have fruits. Yeah. Yeah. And coconut, 
two year and a half, you have fruits. Because of

12:20.622 --> 12:25.268
that, the people are very happy, you know. the 
agriculture made a big difference in Cambodia's

12:26.311 --> 12:31.080
economy? Yeah, yeah, because we rely on 
agriculture, you know, we export all the products

12:31.801 --> 12:49.433
to other countries, to Europe, to Africa, to Hong 
Kong, Singapore, and other countries.

12:56.146 --> 12:59.371
What was the first civil service office you held?

13:09.024 --> 13:15.353
Yeah.

13:25.981 --> 13:35.433
This explains me a little

13:25.981 --> 13:35.433
more about it. In your job interview,

13:35.453 --> 13:47.068
it has civil service work in 1940. And we were 
wondering what that entailed. What kind of job

13:52.756 --> 13:55.920
were you doing at that time? At that time, I was 
young, a little different from here, like a small

13:56.761 --> 14:03.510
governor. I was

14:05.073 --> 14:15.868
assistant or juvenile governor in a small 
district. But at that time, the district was in the

14:16.729 --> 14:24.540
capital of the big province of Thailand. After I 
have been here, a week after that, I have a from

14:25.162 --> 14:38.262
Japanese and Thai government, you know? At that 
time, we have war. Yeah. And you know, Japanese

14:42.027 --> 14:51.321
side with Japan, Thai side with Japan. Germany, 
you know, and we had five, and after that, we lose

14:51.790 --> 15:11.260
that war, and we lose all big province at that time, 
you know, 1940, 1940. After that, in 1942, I, we,

15:18.672 --> 15:24.560
that province to Thailand, and I moved to another 
province.

15:28.045 --> 15:34.174
Did you serve mainly in agriculture during that 
time? No. This didn't have anything to do with

15:34.334 --> 15:36.197
agriculture. In that time, we had war, you know. I 
cannot take care. Right. Yeah. But after that, I

15:40.603 --> 15:47.953
moved to another province, but we still At that 
time, we don't have any material, we don't have any

15:48.271 --> 15:59.644
gasoline, we don't have any peanut food. And I work 
a lot, a lot with the people to grow something new,

16:00.425 --> 16:11.578
to hire the people to grow cotton, to grow 
something, to grow local. Yeah, I have a lot of

16:12.419 --> 16:17.445
experience with the clothes of the people. And 
when food, we grow, you know, peanuts, we grow all

16:17.465 --> 16:24.833
over here. We grow rice, for the government to use 
in the war, you know, to replace gasoline, to

16:24.853 --> 16:37.188
replace, to sell in army, you know.

16:40.131 --> 16:41.633
And from that, but I have my background, because 
I'm a peasant, you know, son, and each vacation I

16:41.967 --> 17:01.927
went home, I work with my father, I work with my 
parents to grow rice, to grow all things. I have

17:02.628 --> 17:09.915
some experience, but after I go to work at the that 
province, we still have war, you know, and we don't

17:10.351 --> 17:24.985
have any products imported from other countries, 
you know. You don't know very well, but Europe has

17:25.589 --> 17:40.979
restrictions, you know, to supply for food, 
because it's a hard time to have food. But my people

17:41.179 --> 17:46.770
still...

17:47.915 --> 17:49.898
They were still growing something. But at that 
time, my country was a French colony, French

17:50.759 --> 18:00.312
protectorate.

18:01.174 --> 18:07.362
I worked under the French government.

18:07.382 --> 18:11.748
And at this time, the French were occupying 
Cambodia. No, no. You know, the French

18:13.371 --> 18:15.854
protectorate, they don't occupy. He let us. work, 
but in all the country have high, yeah, high man,

18:18.205 --> 18:35.299
called resident superior, or governor, big 
governor, and in Peruvian we have a

18:18.205 --> 18:35.299
representative of the governor. I see. Okay. 
Well, how powerful was the Cambodian government

18:40.284 --> 18:48.010
during the French occupation?

18:48.833 --> 18:57.245
During the French occupation, I think this is not 
true. Not true. The French protectorate, you

18:58.907 --> 19:01.231
know. Yeah, the politics was directed by the 
French, you know, and also the economy. But under

19:11.365 --> 19:17.794
Sasson, we have, like, I don't know, we have a 
governor for for all the country and

19:18.230 --> 19:24.758
small for each province. And they take care of 
military and economic, you know, and political.

19:38.013 --> 19:46.363
But we still, we work under the order of So

19:46.917 --> 20:15.743
y'all,

19:46.917 --> 20:15.743
there

19:46.917 --> 20:15.743
wasn't a big conflict with the French in Cambodia? 
Y'all,

20:16.718 --> 20:27.396
Prince Sinahook was for independence from 
France. Yeah, you know, in that time, we have, you

20:27.917 --> 20:40.718
know, wake up from most of the country in the world, 
not only for France, for England, for other

20:27.917 --> 20:40.718
country, you know. India was... It looked like 
Cambodia, you know, Myanmar, all the countries,

20:42.217 --> 20:48.307
most of the countries were Africa. And from that, 
Prasen was the king, and he worked a lot against the

20:49.349 --> 20:59.726
French protectorate. And from 1954, we have 
Cambodian independence.

21:09.436 --> 21:14.764
Did y'all still maintain friendly relations with 
friends? Yeah.

21:18.590 --> 21:24.158
We maintained a relationship with friends, you 
know, and friends still help. But you know, France

21:24.178 --> 21:38.540
is a small country, you know, the size is smaller 
than Texas, you know, and they cannot afford to

21:24.178 --> 21:38.540
help us like America,

21:24.178 --> 21:38.540
you know. Okay.

21:42.410 --> 21:47.097
How did you perceive Prince Sinuhuk as a leader? 
Because you know Sinuhuk was king, and after that

21:48.879 --> 22:11.472
he resigned from king to be chief of party, and 
after that he was, he assumed his position by

21:48.879 --> 22:11.472
president. Did you back

22:12.127 --> 22:38.775
him up?

22:39.278 --> 22:41.923
Were you one of his strong supporters? Yeah, 
because most, I think all the Cambodian people

22:42.143 --> 22:47.494
about him. Because you know Cambodian not like 
other country. One nationality, Cambodian. One

22:55.669 --> 22:58.114
religion, Buddhist, you know. They don't have, 
like, automotive, have Islamic or, uh, a lot of

22:58.381 --> 23:05.091
ethnic, no. They only have in Cambodia. But, you 
know, unfortunately, we live right through the

23:07.715 --> 23:13.364
Communists, you know? And, uh, the people don't 
like Communists, but, you know, when they come

23:13.384 --> 23:21.577
with the people, you know, they have to accept. 
Right. Yeah. Um, did Prince Sinnehook's previous

23:27.254 --> 23:55.118
kingship and his royal background was that um a 
strong reason for his popular popularity in

23:27.254 --> 23:55.118
cambodia yeah i think i support him he was very 
popular he did the blessing for the country you

23:27.254 --> 23:55.118
know but you know in politics after that he didn't 
move before He said Cambodia is a neutral country,

23:55.773 --> 24:04.511
and that we have more, a lot of support, you know? 
And you know, it's one leader, in Asia. You have Chu

24:11.109 --> 24:14.555
Ying Lai or Mao Zedong in China. You have Sukarno in 
Indonesia. You have Nehru in India. You have

24:26.671 --> 24:38.251
I can't recall

24:26.671 --> 24:38.251
his name.

24:40.976 --> 24:45.864
President

24:40.976 --> 24:45.864
Tito.

24:48.589 --> 24:51.514
Yeah.

24:51.882 --> 25:02.477
He was one of five or six leaders, very popular in 
the world, you know.

25:05.461 --> 25:19.560
But, you know, he had a lot of contact with 
communism, and he moved, he moved, moved a little,

25:05.461 --> 25:19.560
you know, a little bit, a little bit, you know. And 
because of that, I had a problem.

25:31.491 --> 25:31.591
OK. I've heard that you debated Prince Sinahook. 
What was the nature of these debates? What do you

25:39.899 --> 25:42.701
mean? Debate.

25:48.907 --> 25:49.648
Let's see. who arbitrate or discuss issues.

25:59.117 --> 25:59.318
Yeah.

27:06.224 --> 27:14.072
Looking back, do you believe that Cambodia's 
policy of neutrality was a beneficial policy?

27:16.234 --> 27:31.709
Yeah, I think now, you know, now I think it's the 
wrong place for us, you know, not before. Now we

27:31.729 --> 27:32.670
have to let go. by

27:33.224 --> 27:49.620
Switzerland, or she had not seen Europe before. 
One, you know, of the Chinese in China was a Chinese

27:49.640 --> 27:51.043
man from Vietnam. He moved to Thailand, not the 
same country. Yes.

28:15.766 --> 28:36.222
And

28:15.766 --> 28:36.222
the fact that sometimes we live with the world, you 
know, because we don't know the smart life, how we

28:15.766 --> 28:36.222
live our lives, we don't know the life, you know, to 
live like us, we don't know the life. From

28:37.366 --> 29:04.825
reading some of the history, it seems like that was 
a constant struggle of Cambodia to be able to

28:37.366 --> 29:04.825
maintain a policy of neutrality between the 
communist and the pro-West, like America. Seems

29:09.138 --> 29:20.213
like the two different powers were constantly 
pulling Cambodia, trying to win them to one side.

29:22.235 --> 29:28.804
Do you think there's any way y'all could avoid that 
kind of conflict? You know, you look a lot in the

29:29.662 --> 29:42.827
book and all, and before, we don't have the 
politics like this, but we still have problems,

29:29.662 --> 29:42.827
you know, and problems and questions, so, you 
know. The neighbor, well, you know, Cambodia was a

29:43.077 --> 29:56.658
very rich country, you know, and you remember this 
is not far from 1854. South Vietnam was Cambodia,

29:56.678 --> 30:01.626
you know, the name of the country, you know. And 
after that, France instead to bring back,

30:01.775 --> 30:22.917
to give

30:01.775 --> 30:22.917
back

30:01.775 --> 30:22.917
to Cambodia, we give back to Myanmar. We have about 
2 million Cambodian people who have a large

30:22.937 --> 30:27.061
Buddhist over there. You know, and the land is very 
fertile, you know. And now, you know,

30:29.163 --> 30:43.290
not enough people who

30:29.163 --> 30:43.290
like to analyze COVID. And before we have the 
territory of Cambodia to Bangkok. And a lot of

30:50.003 --> 30:50.985
Cambodian people live in that area.

31:01.327 --> 31:25.596
Would it have been possible for Cambodia to have 
prohibited North Vietnam's use of the Ho Chi Minh

31:01.327 --> 31:25.596
Trail

31:01.327 --> 31:25.596
in Cambodia

31:01.327 --> 31:25.596
where the North Vietnamese were using the borders 
of Cambodia to receive arms and aid for their

31:26.116 --> 31:34.003
communist movement. Is there any way y'all could 
have prevented them, or any reason why y'all would

31:34.704 --> 31:42.130
like to? You know, because of that, you know, I like 
to know, he was really popular. I support, all the

31:48.776 --> 31:53.220
people support him. He was smart. But when he 
decided alone to let the communists use that way to

31:56.440 --> 32:14.213
send weapons, to send all things to support the 
communists first, Ho Chi Minh way, and second,

32:14.632 --> 32:35.221
through Siena port, you know, from that, before 
the 100, you know, because that pushed Siena to be

32:14.632 --> 32:35.221
out of Cambodia, you know. And also, he reject for 
that, he decide every day more and more to the

32:43.387 --> 32:45.910
communists. I'm hearing a rich head from the 
United States. Was this the, would you consider

32:53.818 --> 33:08.313
this one of the first steps to the communists being 
able to get into Cambodia to its final takeover of

32:53.818 --> 33:08.313
Cambodia? Would this be one of the first, would you 
say? Yeah, yeah, they, you know, If we don't have a

33:13.863 --> 33:28.364
dam like this, we already cannot, the government 
cannot fund, you know, this one. And also, you

33:28.384 --> 33:38.278
know, maybe, you know, himself, he don't, you 
know, we don't know. People like to sign and to...

33:40.913 --> 33:45.278
This way, because he made a mistake himself. He 
believed the communists were very bad at that

33:45.879 --> 33:52.988
time, you know? But from your country, you have 
some problems, you know? And because a lot of

33:58.114 --> 34:07.545
communists spent a lot of money to pay propaganda. 
Right. This, you lose this by weapon, but you lose

34:10.704 --> 34:23.831
people by political propaganda, you know? 
Because most of the people, they don't know

34:23.851 --> 34:30.023
Cambodia, they don't know, but they protest They 
have manifestation, they have protestation in

34:30.830 --> 34:39.001
front of the American embassy, in front of the 
other place. Again and again they want, you know.

34:42.886 --> 34:52.459
But I talk a lot in church, in school, in 
university, I explain. When, you know, the

34:52.479 --> 34:58.828
government calm down, four or five people have a 
lot. protestation in front of American embassy.

35:04.229 --> 35:14.805
When the communists killed every day, thousands 
and thousands, now maybe more than four million,

35:04.229 --> 35:14.805
no one protest. Because we don't do mad propaganda 
like the communists, you know? Yes. And the

35:24.479 --> 35:28.545
people, the people is very nice people, they don't 
know. When they saw the newspaper, they saw it,

35:28.981 --> 35:37.531
they were like, oh, we would like to have peace, we 
don't like to have war. But not true, you know.

35:39.994 --> 35:45.100
Because I know you lose this because of my 
propaganda. Also, people protest against the

35:45.120 --> 35:54.010
government who make newspaper. They share these 
terrible things every day, every day. And one day

35:57.997 --> 36:05.245
when they have enough war, they take over your 
country like me, you know? Yeah. You know, the

36:06.586 --> 36:13.233
smartest people in the world is the shaman people, 
you know? You know? There are a lot, elite people,

36:15.535 --> 36:20.740
marshal, general, or admiral. He was killed by 
Italy, a small one. Because one they use for, one

36:27.693 --> 36:34.444
they use with one. You cannot react, you know. But I 
explain to American people, be careful, you know.

36:40.312 --> 36:46.221
Don't let the people, you know, exploit the 
situation.

36:48.158 --> 36:54.565
This is the freedom, the most freedom in the 
country. You have justice, equality, all things

36:54.585 --> 36:57.528
matter. But you remember, not one behavior. You 
know, like you drive car, you have speed limit. In

37:08.600 --> 37:11.983
democracy, in your position, you have limit. But 
you don't have some. You pass the limit. Like

37:15.968 --> 37:19.453
media, like news people. Some earn a lot of money 
and they don't respect it, you know? First, the

37:26.524 --> 37:33.434
money, and they don't respect the answers of the 
country, you know? It's the most important

37:33.454 --> 37:35.337
country in the world. But, will I help you?

37:46.023 --> 38:09.150
is

37:46.023 --> 38:09.150
one of the factors, you know, in human beings. And 
although you do get to be a conscious person, you

38:09.170 --> 38:12.114
are obsessed with mental distancing, with a 
balance to work for others, to question yourself.

38:12.134 --> 38:13.195
And now, you know, you've got to think more about 
it. Yeah.

38:34.232 --> 38:35.534
And some, you know, have twenty years, sixty years 
of experience. But, you know, there are actually

38:35.554 --> 38:37.798
some, you know, and some, you know, I, My Majesty, I 
don't know, I don't know. Man must stay long, man

38:38.099 --> 38:45.865
must stay long, man must stay long, and to work more 
for your interest. I've

38:48.241 --> 39:07.424
seen them as well,

38:48.241 --> 39:07.424
I've talked to them before. Give them only one 
moment, you know, one time, like this. These four

39:08.606 --> 39:09.367
moments, you know, to give. Four, five, six, one 
moment. One movement, praise God. You

39:10.448 --> 39:32.764
work for the country, you work for the regulation, 
you know, like Senegal, you know, you know, what do

39:10.448 --> 39:32.764
you like? I don't, I don't like to do something to 
write a paper, to write a paper, I don't like to

39:32.784 --> 39:35.629
write a paper, I don't like to say things like that. 
.

39:51.082 --> 39:51.102
. . . .

39:56.433 --> 40:19.085
You

39:56.433 --> 40:19.085
don't know? You don't know about the 
constitution? You say like this? .

40:30.652 --> 40:30.672
. . . . Because

40:32.782 --> 40:54.969
you cannot live, you know, like a prisoner. You 
have to live something. But when you arrive in

40:55.549 --> 40:57.051
life, you have to live something that then you 
know.

41:03.494 --> 41:23.414
You

41:03.494 --> 41:23.414
know, it's not true. I think it's just that time to 
know God. Please, you've got to be lucky to

41:24.255 --> 41:26.757
experience, you know, to be lucky to speak with the 
people, to write, you know, to believe. It's the

41:26.777 --> 41:27.057
best. Why? You know, you have to live it, you know. 
Once you've known the Spirit, you live it, or you

41:27.998 --> 41:29.620
drive a car, you live that way. to

41:30.359 --> 41:54.082
be able to catch this matter. It's not that easy, 
you know. And it's not to be done over and over

41:54.703 --> 41:55.583
again. In fact, when you say that, yes, it's not 
that easy, you see. Two or three times you use this,

41:56.845 --> 42:00.248
or something, two or three days, oh, in the pool, 
you know, you know, first you sit down, put this

41:56.845 --> 42:00.248
paper to... Was

42:00.447 --> 42:25.982
one,

42:00.447 --> 42:25.982
no. involved

42:26.435 --> 42:34.968
in the ouster of

42:26.435 --> 42:34.968
Prince Seneca? Yeah, I

42:34.988 --> 42:45.003
think so. I don't know why he was so much involved in 
the ouster of Prince Seneca. Because he had a

42:47.347 --> 42:48.088
policy of all kinds.

42:54.228 --> 43:08.166
Are

42:54.228 --> 43:08.166
you

42:54.228 --> 43:08.166
all working directly with Prince Sinahil right 
now, or what is he affiliated with? You know, I

43:08.186 --> 43:14.194
was...

43:18.865 --> 43:33.482
May

43:18.865 --> 43:33.482
he forget all things and live to the end of his life. 
.

43:57.205 --> 43:57.226
. . . . . . . . . He

43:58.252 --> 44:25.636
will

43:58.252 --> 44:25.636
be, though, a prominent factor in a new Cambodia. 
No, I don't think so. You know, he lived in Guam. He

44:26.657 --> 44:26.997
lived in Guam. He lived in Guam. He lived in Guam.

44:37.402 --> 44:51.882
Now,

44:37.402 --> 44:51.882
self-believer, he said, all the time. What's 
that? I don't know. You

44:52.403 --> 45:07.840
know, the communists in my country, in Guam, you 
know, we practice this. We practice it, and we use

45:07.860 --> 45:08.802
the man as a shield. We control, and we work. We try, 
and we work inside. We practice, and we use the man

45:09.885 --> 45:10.767
as a shield.

45:14.206 --> 45:36.067
.

45:36.087 --> 45:36.107
. . So,

45:36.127 --> 45:59.333
sinhood was more or less betrayed by the Congress. 
Because,

46:01.912 --> 46:06.690
you know, I...
