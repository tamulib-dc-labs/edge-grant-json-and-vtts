WEBVTT

00:01.499 --> 00:10.952
Trying to find where I might go in terms of career 
was influenced by my brother, really, to consider

00:01.499 --> 00:10.952
fisheries. We were both at San Diego State College 
at that time, and we were sort of looking at various

00:10.992 --> 00:17.020
alternatives. And he happened to run across a 
booklet from the University of Washington that

00:17.080 --> 00:26.513
described the College of Fisheries at that time. I 
guess it was a department.

00:30.389 --> 00:34.354
And I became interested after I read the brochure. 
And quite frankly, I thought fisheries had

00:34.595 --> 00:41.824
something to do with running fish hatcheries and 
things at that period of time. And anyway, my wife

00:41.904 --> 00:51.857
and I came up here in 1946 and essentially

00:41.904 --> 00:51.857
got into the University of Washington. And I guess 
that started my career into fisheries, which

00:51.897 --> 00:56.143
ultimately sort of branched out into a broad range 
of fisheries and oceanographic activities. Were

01:02.054 --> 01:06.460
you reared close to the sea?

01:06.580 --> 01:06.921
Yeah. I actually grew up in a number of seaports. I 
was a small boy. I lived out on Tatoosh Island,

01:12.969 --> 01:23.903
which is the furthest, most northwesterly island 
in the United States before Alaska was added, of

01:12.969 --> 01:23.903
course. Lived out in the Hawaiian Islands. And I 
guess as long as I could remember, it was in the

01:26.670 --> 01:35.741
water in one form or the other, either in a small 
boat or swimming. And had my own outrigger canoe

01:36.061 --> 01:39.185
when I lived in the Hawaiian Islands. We lived in 
Japan and the Philippines and always on the sea. So

01:43.270 --> 01:49.718
I guess that there was an attachment and 
association with the oceans from a very young age.

01:50.279 --> 01:52.101
What did you do in China during the war? You just 
have intelligence service listed. Well, the

01:56.668 --> 02:00.233
China story is rather an interesting one. It's one 
that was ultimately written up and called the Rice

02:00.253 --> 02:04.158
Paddy Navy. During World War II, Chiang Kai-shek 
did not really get along very well with certain

02:04.980 --> 02:13.171
elements of the U.S. government. And as you 
recall, the only U.S. forces allowed in China were

02:13.211 --> 02:20.942
the 14th Air Force. The relationship between the 
Air Force was quite good. There were no U.S. ground

02:23.789 --> 02:25.991
forces in China. Chang saw a need, however, 
apparently, for some American forces in terms of

02:27.693 --> 02:47.434
training, in terms of guerrilla-type 
activities, and through a very close friend he had

02:27.693 --> 02:47.434
in the Navy, Admiral Miles, an arrangement was set 
up to essentially have the Navy send in groups of

02:27.693 --> 02:47.434
their people who were at least on paper 
transferred over to the Chinese National Forces.

02:52.868 --> 03:05.282
And this became a group that worked in demolition, 
coastal observations, weather services, and

02:52.868 --> 03:05.282
were spread almost throughout China. And that was 
my type of activity. It was a broad range of

03:07.845 --> 03:15.673
intelligence type of thing and demolition and you 
might say running warfare. No weather alerting

03:16.514 --> 03:17.455
then? Because they also established a series of 
minerals. Yes, we did. As a component to our,

03:21.006 --> 03:31.178
wherever we had a group, we had about eight major 
groups stationed all the way from the Gobi Desert

03:21.006 --> 03:31.178
all the way down to southeast China. We also had 
meteorologists with us, so we had meteorological

03:31.959 --> 03:35.984
units with us. Sometimes they had to run like the 
rest of us, so they picked up their equipment and

03:36.905 --> 03:42.211
gear and moved from here to there. Did you know 
Spillhouse when he was in China? I did not know

03:45.495 --> 03:47.577
Spillhouse personally. I did have a chance to meet 
with Chang and General Dai Li, which was sort of

03:47.692 --> 04:02.453
his, I guess, Gestapo of the Chinese system at that 
time, and other key Chinese officials. But you

04:03.674 --> 04:11.606
were not suggesting that your activities in China 
had any direct effect upon taking you into, or back

04:03.674 --> 04:11.606
into the sea, or back to the sea? No, no way. I think 
it was just an interlude in my activities. like

04:15.721 --> 04:19.528
most of our Army careers, an unnecessary evil, 
which occurred. So now, when you leave then the

04:21.091 --> 04:30.709
University of San Diego, or San Diego State, and 
come to the University of Washington, did you

04:21.091 --> 04:30.709
enter graduate work then? Undergraduate. I had 
only had about, I guess I finished about a year and

04:31.991 --> 04:39.265
maybe one semester. San Diego State was on the 
semester system. And then I came up here, I think,

04:41.964 --> 04:58.553
in mid-semester and started in the fall of 1946,

04:41.964 --> 04:58.553
I believe, into the University

04:41.964 --> 04:58.553
of Texas. Now, there wasn't even an undergraduate 
school of oceanography here at all in 1946. It's

05:02.963 --> 05:04.445
yet to be organized. So what did you major and work 
in? Well, in essence, at that time, I essentially

05:06.328 --> 05:27.637
took largely fisheries with some oceanographic 
courses as a background, but I really did not take a

05:06.328 --> 05:27.637
great deal of work in the area of such a physical 
oceanography, chemical oceanography, until I

05:06.328 --> 05:27.637
got into graduate studies. And with whom did you 
work? In undergraduate work? Undergraduate

05:30.890 --> 05:31.911
work. Well, largely at that time I worked under old 
Dean Chapman, Webb Chapman, who was a very famous

05:31.931 --> 05:46.567
individual in the field of fisheries 
notionography, who was the dean of the college or

05:31.931 --> 05:46.567
the department at that time. Later became one of 
the first head in the State Department for

05:48.309 --> 05:56.198
Fisheries in the United States in the post that was 
established there, and later was a key element in

05:56.600 --> 06:00.203
the international affairs through the Van Camp 
Foundation. He died several years ago, as you

06:01.324 --> 06:05.348
probably know. He was the dean. I guess the key 
professors that I worked under were Dr.

06:07.350 --> 06:16.319
Waylander,

06:07.350 --> 06:16.319
Dr. DeLacy. I suppose those were the two key people 
that I was most closely associated with in the my

06:24.612 --> 06:26.134
undergraduate career. I did know Dr. Barnes 
fairly well at that time, because I did start going

06:26.254 --> 06:35.966
over and taking some courses from the 
oceanography department. And Dr. Barnes was one

06:35.986 --> 06:43.135
of the old, well, been entrenched over there for a 
great number of years. He was a teacher both when I

06:43.856 --> 06:53.067
was there as an undergraduate and when I came back 
almost a decade later into graduate studies.

06:56.658 --> 07:05.447
After you received your degree in fisheries then, 
the first degree you received in fisheries, you

06:56.658 --> 07:05.447
joined the government service almost at once, did 
you not? Right, but during my college years in the

07:06.388 --> 07:24.808
summer, really the first job I had in fisheries 
that really I sort of was a break-in sort of job for

07:06.388 --> 07:24.808
me and really led me into the ocean end of it rather 
into such areas as fish culture and that sort of

07:06.388 --> 07:24.808
area was that I was stationed one summer down at 
Astoria, Oregon, under the Oregon Department of

07:25.058 --> 07:32.188
Fisheries. And my job was, in essence, to beg rides 
on the trawl fish vessels to carry out a tragging

07:33.309 --> 07:41.059
program. We had no research vessels that are owned 
at that time, and we used to put our, essentially,

07:41.079 --> 07:53.496
tagging boxes on board the back of a trawler if they 
had the proper pumps to get the water circulated

07:41.079 --> 07:53.496
into them. get permission from the skipper to go on 
board and offer to help stand watches and help sort

07:54.168 --> 08:05.415
the catch as a part of the pay to go out and tag fish. 
And that was sort of my first exposure really in

08:06.758 --> 08:10.607
terms of ocean activity. And believe me, it was one 
that I think that I'll never forget because I spent

08:11.824 --> 08:24.181
time on, you know, like about every boat that I 
could climb on, 30 or 40 different boats. And if you

08:25.463 --> 08:40.003
want to see a wide variety of a different type of 
human life is to go on a fishing fleet, you know,

08:25.463 --> 08:40.003
everything from people that are drunks to college 
graduates to people that can't say two words

08:40.642 --> 08:45.947
without swearing to some very sophisticated 
individuals. It was a very diversified type of

08:45.967 --> 08:49.310
population. One charge that's been levied really 
by colleagues of yours has been that one of the

08:50.251 --> 08:58.699
problems with the young oceanographers is they 
don't go to sea often enough. Don't get their feet

08:58.719 --> 09:02.042
wet is the phrase that's usually used. Would you 
agree with this? Well, I think there's a place, of

09:05.365 --> 09:07.527
course, in today's world that relates to the 
people that are associating with, let's say, the

09:07.979 --> 09:19.553
mathematical aspects of modeling that probably 
doesn't require that type of exposure. But I think

09:19.593 --> 09:37.834
that if I had my druthers, I would like to think that 
all of my young people had at least been exposed to

09:19.593 --> 09:37.834
going to sea, both on commercial and research 
vessels, and had some appreciation of the quality

09:19.593 --> 09:37.834
of data in the problems of operating at sea, the 
problems that the fishermen confront, because I

09:38.185 --> 09:50.828
do think it would give them a better perception of 
essentially that database they were working

09:38.185 --> 09:50.828
with. And I think I somewhat resent a good number of 
the young people that come in to becoming

09:50.888 --> 10:01.527
oceanographers. would like to sit and make all 
sorts of value judgments on the basis of the data

10:01.895 --> 10:15.888
and who have never been to sea and who have never 
seen the problems or don't have that sort of

10:01.895 --> 10:15.888
appreciation for what that data is likely to mean. 
So do you work all of your summers now during this

10:18.571 --> 10:22.935
hour tagging off fishing vessels? During that 
period of time? Yeah. I did only the first summer.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.822
And then when I came back, and graduated in 1950 
from the university. I came over to this building

10:36.176 --> 10:45.185
and started in a job, what they called at that time, 
a fishers gear engineer and gear specialist. I've

10:45.205 --> 10:47.808
even forgotten the title, but some title of that 
sort. Equipment and gear specialist. In essence,

10:50.551 --> 10:56.257
which our job was an old group called exploratory 
fishing. And exploratory fishing wasn't very

10:56.277 --> 11:00.522
scientifically oriented at that time. period of 
time. It was sort of go out and throw out the net and

11:02.146 --> 11:15.663
see if you can find fish in an area that essentially 
somebody else hasn't fished before, and somebody

11:02.146 --> 11:15.663
didn't realize there were resources in that area. 
Of course, subsequent to that, over a period of

11:15.683 --> 11:22.832
perhaps five years, it became a very 
sophisticated type of activity. But my first job

11:22.892 --> 11:28.399
was in this exploratory fishing, where we went out 
aboard both commercial and research vessels, and

11:28.885 --> 11:45.704
in essence tried to find the animal complexes that 
weren't subject to commercial exploitation and

11:28.885 --> 11:45.704
to try to decide what latent resources were there 
for future use by the U.S. fishing industry and by

11:28.885 --> 11:45.704
the American public and the world in general. How 
did you make contact with the Bureau of Fisheries

11:47.406 --> 11:50.869
in 1950? Did you know someone over here? I had a very 
good friend who had graduated the year before.

11:56.206 --> 12:00.713
who'd come into the exploratory fishing group, a 
fellow named Don Powell. And Don encouraged me to

12:01.634 --> 12:08.044
come with the exploratory fishing group as a good 
friend in college. And I rather liked the sound of

12:08.064 --> 12:14.675
the adventurous nature of going out and carrying 
out sort of explorations in the ocean. And he

12:14.795 --> 12:19.061
talked me into coming with the group. How long did 
you spend at sea during this period? Oh, boy.

12:24.877 --> 12:34.368
period that I was with the government, and I think 
that was roughly about three and a half years that I

12:24.877 --> 12:34.368
was with them. Maybe I have to look at my records, 
but

12:34.388 --> 12:51.627
I guess I was at sea pretty much a minimum of 100 to 
140 days a year, so a lot of time at sea.

12:54.492 --> 12:56.474
Now, you're right. You spent about three, three 
and a half years with them. And then you leave them

12:58.837 --> 13:01.620
and go on to look at something differently. What 
did you look at and why? Well, there was a couple of

13:03.662 --> 13:05.844
reasons I left then. I left really because I was not 
happy with certain policies that were in terms of

13:05.964 --> 13:18.998
management that related to the then manager or 
director of the exploratory unit. who I at that

13:20.362 --> 13:42.989
time felt took too much of a haphazard approach to 
carrying out the surveys and the activities, and

13:20.362 --> 13:42.989
that there was a failure to document the data 
properly and in the manner that it should be, and

13:20.362 --> 13:42.989
that we weren't making the range of observations 
that I thought felt were important and that we

13:20.362 --> 13:42.989
could make with really out any additional layout 
in terms of funds or effort. And we sort of had a

13:43.009 --> 13:44.490
conflict. He was a gentleman that had essentially 
grown up without a scientific background. I don't

13:51.127 --> 14:12.908
say that he didn't have some good qualities, 
because he did, but he didn't have any real

13:51.127 --> 14:12.908
appreciation for science, and I guess I was a 
scientist, and then our paths sort of collided in

13:51.127 --> 14:12.908
that sense, and I decided to look elsewhere, and at 
that time went over to the Washington Department

13:51.127 --> 14:12.908
of Fisheries to take charge of their commercial 
fish or ground fish studies. And? What was the

14:16.960 --> 14:18.842
Washington Department of Fisheries? Washington 
Department of Fisheries is the state agency here

14:19.503 --> 14:28.474
in the state of Washington that's responsible for 
many of the fishing activities in the state of

14:19.503 --> 14:28.474
Washington. And they have a small research group 
that essentially developed the database upon

14:28.494 --> 14:36.343
which to make decisions, which I became 
associated with. They were also the enforcement

14:36.784 --> 14:38.766
officers set up state regulations, govern the 
salmon fisheries, etc. So, in effect, you're

14:42.307 --> 14:48.260
going from deep sea oceanography to sort of inland 
and coastal oceanography, aren't you? Yeah, to an

14:48.360 --> 14:55.877
extent, except I asked to be associated with the 
offshore trawl fishery, which operated

14:48.360 --> 14:55.877
essentially from... central Washington up to the 
northern tip of Vancouver, so I still had pretty

14:56.380 --> 15:02.567
much an ocean activity. It was the small part, by 
the way, you're right, of the total research

15:03.128 --> 15:07.012
program. Most everything else was associated 
with salmon and inshore activities. It was the

15:11.777 --> 15:21.088
only sort of ocean program that the state was 
supporting, and I think I had two people that

15:11.777 --> 15:21.088
worked with me on that particular project. Now, 
you stayed with this project how long? Same with

15:23.262 --> 15:25.427
that project, roughly five years. And really, I 
think it's the project that shaped my future

15:25.487 --> 15:33.605
outlook and dimensions in terms of where I might 
go. Because again, I got some very earthy

15:33.745 --> 15:37.954
experience in that group. My first job was to set up 
a central interview system with the fishermen to

15:42.348 --> 15:52.941
set up a, in fact, I think it was the first 
application of information collected from a

15:42.348 --> 15:52.941
broad range of the fishing industry into the 
computer system. Those computers were just

15:53.141 --> 15:55.684
getting into being. And I saw the use of using the 
computer system of storing a great deal of both

15:56.365 --> 16:08.980
biological and statistical information, which 
is still in use, by the way, by the state in terms of

15:56.365 --> 16:08.980
making management decisions. And through that 
interview system, one of the first job was to go

16:09.770 --> 16:19.122
down and actually interview every skipper that 
was landing his catches in the state of

16:09.770 --> 16:19.122
Washington. In addition to the traditional 
things of organizing studies that related to

16:19.142 --> 16:35.642
tagging and migrations and population dynamics, 
I also had to set up a system of collecting basic raw

16:19.142 --> 16:35.642
material from the fishermen on which we would have 
a better basis to make judgments. And I just think I

16:36.314 --> 16:39.838
learned a lot from fishermen. I learned a lot from 
my exposure to these people and their leadership

16:40.439 --> 16:45.064
in the industry. I learned a lot about the ocean. I 
learned a lot about fish by going out onto their

16:47.346 --> 16:50.089
boats. And I think that from that time on, I was 
wedded to a program in the oceans itself and in the

16:50.149 --> 16:58.619
sea. OK. And do you do essentially this same job for 
five years? My job was to direct this program. I

17:08.500 --> 17:13.226
guess those five years I... Yeah, right. And you 
were saying my job was essentially to... Yeah, my

17:13.306 --> 17:25.303
job was essentially to put together the 
scientific information, I guess, upon which the

17:13.306 --> 17:25.303
managers could make decisions. And I guess that's 
when I really got into the publication there. I

17:30.410 --> 17:31.431
began from... to develop some very lengthy 
monograms that related to the ground fish and

17:32.153 --> 17:41.944
commercial fish complex or commercial fish 
complex off the coast here. Their behavior

17:42.564 --> 17:48.531
phenomena that I could detect from the statistics 
that the fishermen were submitting to

17:42.564 --> 17:48.531
themselves. In fact, one of the first, and I think 
one of the very good papers I've ever done was on the

17:48.551 --> 17:58.161
seasonal behavioral patterns of ground fish. It 
resulted from my collection of about three years

17:58.664 --> 18:17.890
of the data from the commercial fisheries and then 
examining how the various species were moving in a

17:58.664 --> 18:17.890
bathymetric sense throughout the year, which was 
subsequently published as a major monograph. And

18:17.910 --> 18:19.252
that's where that monograph came from. I was going 
to ask that question you just answered. It came

18:21.015 --> 18:22.336
from research done there. So you think then the 
move into I don't want to use the word academic

18:26.170 --> 18:29.454
oceanography because that's not even fair. And 
first of all, that's not what you do. But you think

18:31.317 --> 18:36.744
that the move into producing hard science in terms 
of publishing comes from this period right here? I

18:36.884 --> 18:39.427
think that was the stimulus, yes. That was the 
period. And that's when I began to sort of reaffirm

18:40.629 --> 18:45.715
my attachments over at the university by going 
over and reviewing the various papers I was

18:46.370 --> 18:51.358
developing with some of my old professors, with 
the people over there. Well, that also answers

18:51.679 --> 18:53.041
another question. The next question I was going to 
ask you, is this the beginning of the direction

18:53.181 --> 18:57.808
going back to graduate school? Because you 
returned to graduate school rather late, as many

18:58.790 --> 19:02.756
of us did. You know, I'm going to make a harsh 
statement here. By the time I had finished five

19:06.803 --> 19:13.153
years, I had probably published as much in my field 
Many PhDs have published sometimes in a career.

19:18.315 --> 19:24.221
And I got a little tired of going to meetings and 
saying, but doctor so-and-so says. It was quite

19:24.261 --> 19:30.628
obvious to me that that attachment to that degree 
carried a great deal of weight. I think it's

19:30.928 --> 19:34.252
unfortunate in some instances, because it does. 
We

19:34.272 --> 19:42.380
have 15 seconds later now. I don't think you need 
to. Where were we, by the way? We were just

19:45.498 --> 19:47.100
finishing up the State of Washington. Well, not 
really. You were commenting that on publication,

19:47.941 --> 19:53.887
where we were. And you were saying that it became a 
little exasperating to go to a meeting and

19:53.927 --> 20:03.798
discover that without a PhD that your comments 
didn't receive the credence they should have.

20:03.999 --> 20:10.766
They didn't receive the weight that certainly 
some people who had a PhD and hadn't done any work in

20:03.999 --> 20:10.766
that field. It was a little bit exasperating. 
You're right. And I finally said to somebody, I

20:15.250 --> 20:21.397
said, well, because that's the way they play the 
game, I'm going to go get back and get that shingle.

20:21.717 --> 20:22.578
Yeah. And so that's when you begin to make the 
decision to go back and take a PhD. I was

20:26.262 --> 20:31.647
influenced, by the way, very strongly by my boss in 
Washington at that time.

20:34.631 --> 20:38.775
That's just after I left fisheries and came back 
with the federal service. I had a fellow named

20:39.976 --> 20:44.481
Stewart back there that just said, you know, I 
think you ought to go back and get a PhD. And as far as

20:47.899 --> 20:51.465
I'm concerned, the government will make time for 
you to go back and get it. He said that until you do,

20:51.725 --> 20:58.937
you aren't going to be able to play the game with the 
big boys in the way you'd like to. This must be 58,

21:00.059 --> 21:01.501
right? That's right. And what are you doing in 58? 
58, I've left the Department of Fisheries again

21:03.865 --> 21:12.038
because I have sort of a history of this. I'm fairly 
independent in my attitudes, and if I feel that I

21:13.672 --> 21:34.581
cannot honestly work for a manager and support his 
philosophies, then rather than grumble down at

21:13.672 --> 21:34.581
the bar, I go and essentially meet with that 
individual and say that, you know, tell him what

21:13.672 --> 21:34.581
the problem is. If we can't rectify it, I 
essentially leave. And when there was a new

21:37.445 --> 21:41.991
director of fisheries came on, only Milo Moore 
that I'm still a very good friend in, but had

21:42.460 --> 21:56.923
certain policies in the way of using scientists 
more in the basis of to support political

21:42.460 --> 21:56.923
decisions rather than develop science that I just 
essentially couldn't live with. And in essence,

21:57.244 --> 22:00.909
he and I had a confrontation. And I decided that I 
wasn't going to prosper very much any longer under

22:00.969 --> 22:09.463
the Department of Fisheries. left the Department 
of Fisheries along with many other good

22:09.983 --> 22:13.749
scientists. At that time, there was a major sort of 
exodus from the Washington Department of

22:13.769 --> 22:25.366
Fisheries of perhaps 15 or 20 of their best 
scientists at that time for the same reasons. He

22:25.386 --> 22:30.754
was an individual who felt that he didn't need 
scientists. And where he did need them, he needed

22:30.895 --> 22:36.904
them to parrot what his philosophies were rather 
than what the data said. And as a result, many

22:37.004 --> 22:39.147
people left. I came back and started to work for, 
under the same individual, replacing, excuse me,

22:39.937 --> 22:48.687
the individual that got me into this business. Mr. 
Powell had been here, went to Washington, and I

22:48.707 --> 22:57.997
came and replaced him and took over as sort of 
director of the exploratory fishing group here in

22:48.707 --> 22:57.997
1958. And that's when you decided, I take it then 
you must have gone to work on your Ph.D. part-time?

23:03.511 --> 23:07.821
I guess it was about six months after I came back 
that I made the commitment. And at that time, I

23:08.021 --> 23:10.868
started on a part-time basis. And I think I only 
took one quarter off. I had to have some regulation

23:15.979 --> 23:21.672
that related to residency period, and I had to take 
one one quarter off. But the remainder of that, I

23:23.177 --> 23:34.248
sort of, and it's not a very good way to go through a 
PhD program, but I struggled through a good number

23:23.177 --> 23:34.248
of years on sort of a part-time program. Yeah, it is 
not a very pleasant way to receive a degree. It's a

23:37.952 --> 23:38.813
lousy way. And believe me, I don't encourage it 
because it is a stress on you and a stress on keeping

23:38.853 --> 23:44.939
your job going. And I don't think you do quite the 
job that you could do that if you were off on a

23:52.111 --> 23:54.394
full-time basis. I don't think I suffered any in my 
grades or anything, but nevertheless, I could

23:54.414 --> 23:59.741
have done a better job. Now, what were you doing in 
terms of job occupation at this time? At that time,

24:05.448 --> 24:21.088
I was directing the exploratory group, which by 
that time, remember I said I wasn't happy with it

24:05.448 --> 24:21.088
when I left, allowed me to sort of provide a whole 
new philosophy of what exploratory fishing meant

24:05.448 --> 24:21.088
in terms of both answering questions the interest 
of the academic community, at the same time

24:21.777 --> 24:28.505
providing valuable data to the industry upon 
which they could make decisions. I was convinced

24:28.545 --> 24:42.340
both needs could be met, where my former boss felt 
that you really couldn't do the science because in

24:28.545 --> 24:42.340
order to tell a fisherman he could catch so many 
pounds of fish in certain areas, you could only

24:28.545 --> 24:42.340
handle it one way. And I just didn't believe this. 
And we developed a whole new philosophical base.

24:49.848 --> 24:51.210
And then I was able to attract. some real good 
scientists into the program. I attracted Dr.

24:54.610 --> 25:02.478
Pereira into the program from the University of 
Washington, who became a mainstay of that program

24:54.610 --> 25:02.478
later. Just a number of good scientists came into 
the program and it became, you know, and I have to

25:04.721 --> 25:16.894
say I have a bias, but it became a very productive 
group in terms of publications, in terms of the

25:17.347 --> 25:23.498
fisheries communities throughout the 
northeastern Pacific and the oceanography of the

25:17.347 --> 25:23.498
area.

25:27.765 --> 25:30.309
How long did you stay with this program? I stayed 
with that program until—and here, you know, my

25:30.330 --> 25:41.008
dates are going to bother me, but I guess it was 
sometime in the late Or in 1969, you become

25:42.355 --> 25:47.263
associate director of Fishers. Okay, I was 
reaching for the date. I knew it was in the late 60s.

25:51.090 --> 25:59.925
I was there almost a decade, and that program in 
that period of time grew from roughly five

25:51.090 --> 25:59.925
individuals, which is what it was when I came to it. 
to one that had about 25 individuals and a

26:00.412 --> 26:23.235
full-time vessel assignment to it, and was 
essentially making and providing the basic

26:00.412 --> 26:23.235
documents and scientific publications upon 
which we entered into our early negotiations with

26:00.412 --> 26:23.235
Japan for resolution of some of the high seas 
fishing programs in that area. And it was these

26:23.255 --> 26:26.559
publications that served as the basis of our 
negotiations. Well, that was almost the complete

26:26.579 --> 26:29.862
database For our early work, when we had to go to 
Japan in terms of trying to re-establish a

26:30.145 --> 26:43.223
rational fishery for bottom fish off our coast in 
the Bering Sea, it was almost totally based on the

26:30.145 --> 26:43.223
work that we had done over the past decade. Well, I 
was going to ask you something about Japanese

26:43.243 --> 26:46.267
fishing anyway, by the way. And so I want to break 
away from chronological approach right now and

26:46.347 --> 26:51.113
ask you a couple of things. Will American 
fishermen ever be able to compete with the

26:51.133 --> 26:55.399
Japanese? Yes, they are now. in part because the 
200-mile limit provides certain preferential

26:58.259 --> 27:21.904
rights, and in part because the 200-mile limit, if 
properly managed...

26:58.259 --> 27:21.904
...going to raise the abundance level of these 
fishes until they can be competitive.

27:25.580 --> 27:40.943
In essence,

27:25.580 --> 27:40.943
one sees that happening now, by

27:25.580 --> 27:40.943
the way. We were making a few comments about 
competition with Japan. Oh, OK. And I ask you if we

27:49.188 --> 27:51.834
can ever compete. In certain areas. I'm convinced 
it's going to be a long time where we can compete for

27:54.401 --> 28:07.332
low-priced, high-volume bottom fish like 
pollock, like redfish, like codfish. But for

28:07.632 --> 28:24.910
certain key target species like the crustacean 
complex, I'm going to forecast within a decade

28:07.632 --> 28:24.910
we're going to be taking utilities in the full 
surplus that's available in the Bering Sea of all

28:07.632 --> 28:24.910
the crabs, of all the shrimp. That fishery is just 
booming right now. The fact is it increased 100% in

28:29.335 --> 28:32.458
one year. The ex-vessel value of the raw material 
taken out of the Bering Sea for crabs this last year

28:32.742 --> 28:45.241
was close to $80 million, U.S. And so the 
foreigners are going to be out of business.

28:45.281 --> 28:47.063
They're just not going to be there. Other species 
of finfish, of course halibut, there's no

28:48.445 --> 28:52.732
problem. The one I see us moving into very rapidly 
is black cod, which is a high-valued local species

28:53.193 --> 29:02.226
here, which has produced about 60 million pounds, 
which has largely gone to Japan. which my guess is

29:02.813 --> 29:08.344
we'll be reducing the total potential of that also 
within the next 5 to 10 years. That fishery is

29:08.725 --> 29:10.348
growing very rapidly. We're now competitive. We 
have the gear. We have the boats. The price is up to a

29:13.193 --> 29:16.620
range where our fishermen can afford to go out and 
catch it.
