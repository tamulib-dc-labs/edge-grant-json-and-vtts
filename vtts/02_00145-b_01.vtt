WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:13.053
and I probably made a mistake and recorded on top of 
the A side of tape number one, part of what Fred has

00:02.579 --> 00:13.053
been sharing. We're now, and he is sharing with us 
his experiences with the Student Judicial Board.

00:24.709 --> 00:25.410
FRED PODESTA. Or the Judicial Board, the J Board, 
as it was called. DAVID BURRAGE. The J Board. that

00:28.887 --> 00:36.556
they charged him with failure to- No, I was taken 
before the J Board, which by the way was all

00:28.887 --> 00:36.556
appointed by me. I was taken before the J Board for 
failure to implement legislation which had been

00:36.576 --> 00:45.105
enacted by the previous student senate. And that 
was a requirement that the students be given an

00:45.866 --> 00:53.575
opportunity to vote confidence or no confidence 
in all the professors. And that this information

00:54.756 --> 00:57.139
be made available. to students such that when they 
registered for the spring semester that they

00:57.406 --> 01:06.840
would have this knowledge at hand. A piece of 
legislation, by the way, which I opposed as a

01:06.860 --> 01:13.771
student senator, but didn't have to vote because I 
was speaker. In any event,

01:15.374 --> 01:24.848
the guy who was responsible for putting this 
legislation together, who'd been the vice

01:15.374 --> 01:24.848
president for academic affairs, got angry with me 
because I didn't do it. And so he filed charges

01:28.377 --> 01:35.864
against me before the Judicial Board, which, as I 
said, I appointed all the members. And

01:37.206 --> 01:40.970
ironically, I got off on a technicality. And the 
technicality was that ultimately the charges

01:41.770 --> 01:53.923
were moved because since it had to be done in 
December and he didn't take me to the J Board until

01:41.770 --> 01:53.923
February, It was too late, so it couldn't be 
enforced anyway. But it was kind of fun there for

01:57.518 --> 02:06.589
two or three weeks, being the center of attention 
in terms of legislation that I refused to

01:57.518 --> 02:06.589
implement as student body president. Some of the 
other things that we were engaged in during that

02:06.609 --> 02:12.737
time frame, I had a couple of unpopular things that 
I was involved in. We had a fairly unsuccessful

02:12.797 --> 02:23.590
program where student government had been trying 
to help decrease the cost of textbooks for

02:24.599 --> 02:27.202
students. And we ran a thing called, it was 
actually a co-op kind of a deal, but we ran a thing

02:28.364 --> 02:34.332
called Bookmark. And we ran into one of the 
traditional problems associated with

02:36.074 --> 02:44.565
student-run volunteer organizations. couldn't 
pay anything to anybody, and so it was kind of hard

02:44.984 --> 02:48.008
to run the thing. And so we finally reached the 
conclusion that it was something that needed to be

02:48.028 --> 02:52.374
shut down. So I got the chance to shut down 
Bookmark. We also rented refrigerators, which is

02:56.419 --> 03:14.923
an interesting concept because the 
refrigerators, and again, another thing that

02:56.419 --> 03:14.923
required manpower, refrigerators were rented by 
kids who lived in the dorm, which got to the whole

02:56.419 --> 03:14.923
question of whether or not kids could have alcohol 
in dorms and what rules we were able to deal with in

03:15.325 --> 03:22.717
terms of what the use of alcohol on university 
property. And fortunately, we worked very well

03:23.679 --> 03:32.895
with the folks over at the university officials on 
the rules and regulations committee to come up

03:23.679 --> 03:32.895
with a program of work in that regard. We also, back 
early during that time frame, and this is really

03:33.636 --> 03:40.928
neat since we're about to have a dedication of this 
soon on campus, and I had the opportunity 20 years

03:41.515 --> 03:45.178
later to both piece of legislation to create a 
daycare center. The nature of the student

03:46.620 --> 03:48.882
population was changing. And back during the time 
that I was student body president, we pursued

03:49.422 --> 04:05.037
rather strongly the idea of trying to create a 
daycare facility on campus for married kids who

03:49.422 --> 04:05.037
both parents were going to school, but they didn't 
have any daycare facilities. And I'm quite proud

04:05.117 --> 04:11.083
that we're at that point now, 20 years later, at the 
university. We toured around with creating a food

04:11.823 --> 04:21.272
co-op, another opportunity to try to

04:11.823 --> 04:21.272
save kids money. But we kept running into this, how 
do you fund it kind of a scenario. But I think they

04:29.000 --> 04:30.181
were great ideas. During that time frame, too, we 
got very involved in external affairs in terms of

04:30.221 --> 04:40.952
involvement in the governance of the city of 
College Station. which we thought was important.

04:45.676 --> 04:57.827
Because since we had such a large number of 
students living there, and many of them were

04:45.676 --> 04:57.827
living off campus, that their lives were affected 
by decisions that were made by the city council. So

04:58.168 --> 05:01.751
we had regular representation there in terms of 
their meetings. And we very often got in the mix to

05:01.811 --> 05:07.456
some of the stuff that they were discussing. Two, 
we had a lot of involvement in Austin. in terms of

05:11.915 --> 05:17.262
what the Texas legislature was doing during that 
period of time. One of the big fights that we always

05:17.282 --> 05:25.111
had, which is of course one that continues 
probably even to this day, is how we divided up

05:17.282 --> 05:25.111
student service fees. It was the annual ritual 
that we went through, not unlike the federal

05:25.131 --> 05:30.017
budget process. And going through the process of 
how much money the athletic department got and how

05:30.738 --> 05:40.470
much went to the various other activities 
associated with running student-related

05:30.738 --> 05:40.470
activities on campus. And it's now about 10 or 11 
till. I don't know whether they're here yet, so we

05:44.673 --> 05:48.158
can't be. Let's see. Do you remember any, let's 
talk about people that you wish you could thank.

05:57.529 --> 06:02.074
Faculty members that really you remember with 
pride, joy, gratitude? The one with anger, I can't

06:02.114 --> 06:08.422
remember his name. Actually, you know, I, I 
really, really had...

06:16.610 --> 06:20.433
I mean, I could probably go down the list of... Who 
would you want to thank most? Who were at the top of

06:21.815 --> 06:23.096
the list? Your gratitude. I guess probably 
thanking most would be... This is dangerous

06:27.880 --> 06:30.943
because a lot of these people are still alive.

06:33.645 --> 06:38.610
But I guess probably...

06:38.630 --> 06:40.191
I cannot not It is very difficult for me to pick out 
one, and the reason to pick that is difficult is

06:40.947 --> 07:01.087
because various ones among them, we had an 
interface that was different. For example, if you

07:01.227 --> 07:10.937
take out the student services piece, the student 
activities leadership piece, you know, John

07:01.227 --> 07:10.937
Colas, Stan's head and shoulders because he was 
the one that I spent most of my time with because of

07:11.187 --> 07:19.181
his capacity. But then within that mix, you got 
Carol Nadair, who really was the one who sort of

07:19.762 --> 07:25.652
held with student government in particular. And 
frankly, I served as student body president

07:26.634 --> 07:35.710
during that period of time when Dr. Williams was 
ill. And Clyde Freeman was acting president of

07:36.382 --> 07:43.090
Texas A&M University during the time that I was 
student vice president. And I used to kid him and

07:43.150 --> 07:48.136
say that we got away with murder because all he was 
concerned about was finance anyway. So

07:48.176 --> 07:56.746
therefore, we could get away with whatever we 
wanted, even though I had great times with Jack

07:48.176 --> 07:56.746
Williams prior to that. But I guess on the student 
services side, it's probably him. And you put into

08:01.512 --> 08:05.697
that mix, too, Bob Boone, That gave me not only a 
cultural experience, but a fun experience to do

08:06.031 --> 08:12.778
something I liked a whole lot. I would have great 
guy who I think took and did just virtually the

08:12.798 --> 08:26.651
impossible task in terms of making that work for 
the city cadets and thus for the university. What

08:26.671 --> 08:35.920
about over the people that- On the academic side- 
That taught you and- Yeah, on the academic side, I

08:26.671 --> 08:35.920
probably would have to stick most with those folks 
in my college. and more specifically within my

08:36.558 --> 08:42.304
department, you know, I can't take Dr. I can't take 
R.C. Potts out of the equation because of what he

08:43.626 --> 08:48.451
did. And then I've mentioned both of these other 
three or four guys earlier, Don Levi and J.C. Gray

08:48.471 --> 09:02.987
and Herman Brown because of how they molded and 
directed me during on the academic side of the

09:03.473 --> 09:05.315
equation. But you know, those guys, too, were the 
same kinds of guys that if I had some sort of,

09:05.616 --> 09:31.827
whether it was a personal problem or whether it was 
a personal challenge or whether it was

09:05.616 --> 09:31.827
something I wanted to do student 
government-wise, I wanted to bounce it off of

09:05.616 --> 09:31.827
somebody, or whether it was some other sort of 
challenge, I could see any of those guys any time.

09:33.055 --> 09:46.996
And it was something that I'm most grateful for to 
this day, the guidance that they provided me. One

09:47.016 --> 10:00.075
of the great things about all of those people I 
mentioned, and many others too, the thing that I

09:47.016 --> 10:00.075
think makes Texas A&M unique in terms of its 
student leadership opportunities is that

10:03.177 --> 10:25.521
The folks who, the adults, if you will, who are 
responsible for providing direction were always

10:03.177 --> 10:25.521
open to

10:03.177 --> 10:25.521
allowing students to make their own choices, 
allowing students to fail, even if they fail, and

10:03.177 --> 10:25.521
allow them to try something new. In other words, 
they allowed kids to lead.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.352
Yeah, there were some opportunities. There were 
some instances when we wanted to do something that

10:32.372 --> 10:40.160
perhaps the administration did not want us to do. 
But those were not that many. I remember one in

10:45.205 --> 10:49.369
particular, which is kind of a fun story. The 
university had made a decision that it wanted to

10:49.389 --> 10:57.838
shut down, I want to say it was Milner Hall, but it 
was one of the dorms over by the By Sabisa, there was

10:59.185 --> 11:12.721
one of these on air condition, had hanging pipes, 
showers in the middle of each floor, and restrooms

10:59.185 --> 11:12.721
and showers in the middle of each floor. And it 
wanted to turn it into, I believe, a math, I think it

11:13.743 --> 11:22.453
was a math office building. It might have been 
Miller. It was one of those two over at that

11:23.474 --> 11:27.319
Hotard-Miller area. And we caught wind of it. And, 
you know, we thought we came up with these really

11:30.891 --> 11:43.248
ingenious arguments that, in fact, one of our 
guys, one of the guys who was vice president on our

11:30.891 --> 11:43.248
team, either had some buddies in there or had lived 
in there at some point in time. And we didn't like

11:43.268 --> 11:48.175
the thought of taking the dormitory, you know, 
just shortage of housing. We could always make

11:48.215 --> 11:49.456
that argument. You want to keep kids on campus and 
all these kinds of things. Plus, the kids want to

11:52.100 --> 11:53.602
live there. And these old man professors didn't 
need any more space. They had space anyway. So why

11:56.946 --> 11:58.268
are we going to do this? And we individually 
lobbied the members of the Board of Regents. And we

12:03.423 --> 12:05.506
rolled the administration. And the board voted in 
our favor. We held it off for a year. We finally

12:08.569 --> 12:23.285
lost, but it was one of those where, and I'll never 
forget the anger which was expressed to us by the

12:08.569 --> 12:23.285
administration for our having the gall to go 
around their back and go lobby members of the Board

12:08.569 --> 12:23.285
of Regents. Was Freeman or Williams president? 
Uh, it was an honor to be president, so, uh, Clyde

12:25.602 --> 12:28.446
Wilson. Clyde, okay. Clyde Wilson. Uh, and, uh, 
because this is something I think had come up

12:31.169 --> 12:42.184
through academic affairs, through, I guess, John 
Calhoun was an academic affairs guy, but the guy

12:31.169 --> 12:42.184
who led that was Scott Gregson of Garrison, Texas, 
who was vice president of finance. And old Scott

12:42.204 --> 12:45.188
said, we've got to lobby the members of the board, 
and we lobbied everybody. We've got enough votes

12:45.208 --> 12:51.136
on the board of regents to turn, to get them to turn 
down the request of administration. It was kind of

12:51.236 --> 12:52.238
cool. Well, let's see, we're... I don't encourage 
that now, by the way. Okay.
