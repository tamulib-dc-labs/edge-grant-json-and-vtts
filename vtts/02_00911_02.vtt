WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:06.695
a different situation had taken place. When I came 
back immediately after 1951, I had an offer to come

00:07.636 --> 00:23.539
as visiting professor to University of North 
Carolina in Raleigh, as well as Chapel Hill. And I

00:24.981 --> 00:30.409
had an offer to maybe take over the program there in 
the School of Architecture, but they had already a

00:30.541 --> 00:40.954
very, very good planning program in Chapel Hill 
with Jack Parker. And so I went back and forth, but

00:41.715 --> 00:50.626
while I was there, I met the Vice Chancellor of 
North Carolina, who had just become the

00:41.715 --> 00:50.626
Chancellor of the University of Texas. So when I 
came back here, he came back, and we had already a

00:51.688 --> 00:58.236
working relationship, and he supported me quite 
vociferously, sending me to the various meetings

00:58.418 --> 01:13.301
on the Southern Regional Education Board, which 
we tried to join, but there was an enormous

00:58.418 --> 01:13.301
opposition. Texas has a certain aversion to join 
other regions. And so Wilson Logan or Logan

01:22.448 --> 01:25.871
Wilson, could not do anything. But he set up two 
committees, one committee under his own

01:25.891 --> 01:50.616
guidance, you may say, consisting of various 
people from all involved, law, for instance, or

01:25.891 --> 01:50.616
engineering, or whatever, and another one, a 
working committee, the Graduate Studies

01:25.891 --> 01:50.616
Committee, also consisting of the chairman of 
various groups and professors in sociology and

01:25.891 --> 01:50.616
economics, engineering and so forth. Mr. 
Gleuner, for instance, Dr. Gleuner, who is now the

01:53.479 --> 01:57.185
Dean of College of Engineering. How does he spell 
his name? Gleuner, G-L-O-Y-N-E, Gleuner. And

02:03.454 --> 02:11.626
they had all established planning in their 
departments, which is, of course, a very good

02:03.454 --> 02:11.626
thing. But it didn't work out in our case. In fact, 
reasonable planning was resented by people in

02:15.111 --> 02:19.978
economics, And as a side

02:21.140 --> 02:46.163
remark, I just want to mention that at that time, 
probably already, the ideas of the LBJ, the

02:21.140 --> 02:46.163
Institute of Public Affairs, was going around, 
but of course nobody could talk about these

02:21.140 --> 02:46.163
things, so we were still encouraged to go on our 
way, but the administration's heart was no longer

02:21.140 --> 02:46.163
in it. And so when we finally, in 1959, got the 
official permission of the coordinating board.

02:55.368 --> 02:58.511
By that time, they all had left and went their own 
way. And it was a pretty hard struggle from then on.

03:00.613 --> 03:04.216
So we had a small program within architecture. And 
it was a period of struggle. But we had a small

03:09.141 --> 03:14.025
number of people who went through this. By that 
time, I had reached retirement age. we had new

03:18.295 --> 03:22.241
people coming in and from then on the whole thing 
took off. So I just want to talk up to that point.

03:37.344 --> 03:45.636
Actually, in connection with a German film on the 
redevelopment of the Ruhr, area in Western

03:46.207 --> 03:55.620
Germany, along the Rhine and the Ruhr, a film was 
made, which I produced here several times. And in

03:56.641 --> 04:07.236
that connection, a discussion took place in New 
York, where they talked about the difficulties

03:56.641 --> 04:07.236
which They're quite obvious in my efforts here, 
but they're also quite universal over the United

04:07.958 --> 04:12.723
States. And I just wanted to quote something here 
because it has to do with an understanding of the

04:13.424 --> 04:26.038
difficulties elsewhere, I imagine. But anyway, 
in this discussion in New York, a speaker

04:26.058 --> 04:37.611
commented on why Americans have a bias toward 
planning. The speaker made much of the

04:38.131 --> 04:44.098
impossibility of transferring cultural values 
from Europe to the United States. The speaker, a

04:45.100 --> 04:54.271
woman, pointed out that Americans have an 
anti-historical bias in the total culture,

04:45.100 --> 04:54.271
irrespective of where they come from originally. 
That prevents them from implementing any

04:54.792 --> 05:01.720
planning program, especially in the 
northeastern cities of the United States. In

05:01.781 --> 05:02.181
fact, In New York, Boston, and so on, European 
principles of town planning cannot be applied at

05:02.701 --> 05:09.710
all, either physically or administratively. 
Well, I just want to put that in because that

05:11.693 --> 05:22.547
explains a lot of the difficulties, you know, 
which are part of the, you may say, the sentiment,

05:11.693 --> 05:22.547
you know, the general sentiment. So when I say I had 
a struggle, it is really nothing unusual. No, not

05:27.573 --> 05:30.497
at all. Except I didn't know all these things.

05:35.976 --> 05:36.337
All right. But there was a lot of European 
influence, nevertheless. Oh, yes. Particularly

05:42.587 --> 05:49.939
eastern cities, in terms of their early planning 
programs. Not so much in the Middle West or the Far

05:50.039 --> 05:55.067
West, because we were too isolated from Europe. 
But it was much easier for a person living in Boston

05:55.537 --> 06:03.145
or New York to get to Europe than it was for him to get 
to Texas or California, even. Well, Bob, you're

06:03.726 --> 06:04.647
absolutely right. Because when I mentioned at the 
beginning of our interview the Rockefeller

06:04.687 --> 06:19.142
grant, which I received, and the $80,000 each 
given to Harvard, MIT, and Columbia University,

06:04.687 --> 06:19.142
what they do with the money. Columbia University 
got Raymond Unwin from England.

06:25.186 --> 06:38.084
MIT got

06:25.186 --> 06:38.084
Father and Son, the Englishman, who was chairman 
of the department for quite a while.

06:41.709 --> 06:42.650
We'll fill that in later. Yeah, on the 
conscription. Adams, Mr. Adams. Oh, yes, yes.

06:48.418 --> 06:49.039
Frederick Adams. Frederick, our father. with a 
regional plan, New York, you know, and his son, who

06:51.072 --> 06:58.666
became chairman of MIT, of MIT, the planning 
program. So, I mean, this illustrates that the

06:59.608 --> 07:07.883
European influence was very strong up to that 
point, and then it sort of broke down and away from

06:59.608 --> 07:07.883
it. But during the 1910s and 1920s, it was 
fantastic, the European influence, especially

07:09.618 --> 07:24.641
French, and to some degree German, through the 
districting or zoning in German cities. But that

07:26.504 --> 07:31.592
didn't really transmit very much to the Middle 
West or West. Well, it took actually... Except for

07:33.976 --> 07:34.897
people like you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's 
incidental. No, it really is evident in Texas. You

07:46.843 --> 07:49.767
know, Colonel Kessler. I have written that all 
down because it is... George Kessler? Was it

07:54.753 --> 07:55.794
George Kessler? From Kansas City? Yes, of course. 
He

07:59.519 --> 08:07.890
was the one that did the incredible park system for 
Kansas City and worked in Dallas and Fort Worth. As

08:08.005 --> 08:09.547
well as El Paso. But he was educated in Germany.

08:16.915 --> 08:27.427
We're not quite sure if he was born in Germany and 
raised in Dallas, and then his mother took him back

08:16.915 --> 08:27.427
to Germany for his education later on. But we're 
not quite sure if he was born in Germany or not. Bob,

08:37.351 --> 08:53.187
in 1965, Martha

08:37.351 --> 08:53.187
and I were asked to write a... summarize what we 
knew about the history of planning in Texas up to

08:37.351 --> 08:53.187
that time. So that was done for the League of Women 
Voters of Texas. And it may have some pertinent

08:57.912 --> 09:02.417
stuff in there. You were just talking about 
Kessler and... Of course, we know that he worked in

09:06.798 --> 09:15.851
Fort Worth, in Dallas, and I believe also in El 
Paso. Yes. He did a plan in 1925 in El Paso. Yes. And

09:21.959 --> 09:32.414
this is here sort of a rundown of these various 
efforts, which, of course, is no longer up to date.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.936
It is only... taking in the area prior to the 
development as we know it now. Why is it that the

09:44.312 --> 09:52.961
University of Texas planning program has never 
achieved separate departmental status?

10:00.669 --> 10:03.332
They have their own faculty, they control their 
own budget why is it that they don't have you know a

10:03.835 --> 10:26.890
clear departmental status within the university 
structure well bob this is a very complex

10:03.835 --> 10:26.890
situation the university of texas of course now 
it's a systems university but has a very large

10:28.473 --> 10:57.653
uh... budgetary setup i mean a very large 
commitment to spend their monies and uh... they

10:28.473 --> 10:57.653
don't like to deal with small entities in other 
words uh... let's say the college of arts and

10:28.473 --> 10:57.653
sciences is an enormous thing that was broken down 
into colleges into different colleges to take the

10:28.473 --> 10:57.653
sciences and the arts Separately. Now, the School 
of Architecture was a school within the College of

11:00.452 --> 11:05.822
Engineering. It was a department, actually, 
together with the other eight or ten or twelve

11:07.765 --> 11:13.435
departments. And as such, they took an 
administrative unit through the dean to the

11:14.617 --> 11:22.510
president. And of course the administration is 
not too much impressed by small units which have

11:23.992 --> 11:45.882
really not much of a backing, financial backing, 
such as law or medicine or even economics or

11:23.992 --> 11:45.882
business administration, you know. And that has 
been actually the main reason. So the struggle we

11:51.911 --> 11:57.758
had was constantly to get our share within a larger 
budget. And maybe that isn't such a bad idea

11:58.979 --> 12:03.324
because you really have to exert yourself. You 
have to show. Now, the whole system is based on

12:05.006 --> 12:11.794
student enrollment and graduate numbers. And 
since our program has never been very large, it

12:16.793 --> 12:19.156
didn't seem to make too much sense to the 
administration. And in addition to this, the

12:21.498 --> 12:36.356
whole field of planning, as defined by the 
American Institute of Planners at the time,

12:21.498 --> 12:36.356
through their accrediting board, became very, 
very stringent in their requirements, which

12:21.498 --> 12:36.356
today is no longer the case. And once we had 
fulfilled one set of requirements, they had added

12:38.078 --> 12:43.244
others. And as a result, we never quite made it 
until... We got Mr. Cole, who had very good input in

12:47.152 --> 12:55.444
Washington, having been with the Transportation 
Administration. And through his effort, he had

12:57.066 --> 13:03.576
received pretty large research grants prior to 
coming. Afterwards, it was no longer the case to

13:03.676 --> 13:07.762
such an extent. So by looking at it this way, they 
felt that there was really a lot of pressure from

13:09.044 --> 13:16.855
the outside, because the Americans are planners. 
The Texas chapter made numerous efforts. We

13:21.234 --> 13:34.448
brought in just about everybody from

13:21.234 --> 13:34.448
Mosseen, who was president of AIP, to Paul 
Oppermann, who was president of MIT, to Cusick,

13:21.234 --> 13:34.448
who was president of AIP. We had all these people 
here. They made all efforts, but to no avail. And so

13:39.654 --> 13:42.517
it was one of these things. And of course, today, in 
retrospect, the situation is different again. so

13:48.138 --> 14:03.212
that, as is the case probably in any discipline, 
changes take place and they make past efforts in

13:48.138 --> 14:03.212
retrospect seem rather futile.

14:03.232 --> 14:18.145
In connection with this, we made enormous efforts 
not only to bring the various succeeding

14:03.232 --> 14:18.145
presidents of national AIP to Austin to 
participate in conferences and talk to the

14:19.002 --> 14:23.087
chancellor, president, and the dean of officials 
and so forth. But we also attempted to get monies

14:24.008 --> 14:40.588
from the Ford Foundation, which gave enormous 
amounts of money to any number of universities to

14:24.008 --> 14:40.588
set up departments, independent departments 
with their own budgets.

14:41.682 --> 14:55.334
And so to think in terms of the millions, scores of 
millions of dollars that went into University of

14:41.682 --> 14:55.334
Wisconsin or, of course, Harvard, MIT, Columbia, 
Tennessee, you name it. I mean, any number of

14:55.374 --> 15:01.840
places didn't seem to make too much difference to 
our administration. I personally had the

15:02.180 --> 15:11.048
permission of the then Vice President Ransom to 
talk to people at the... Ford Foundation in New

15:11.500 --> 15:30.668
York, and that didn't help either much, because 
there were too many competing areas on this campus

15:11.500 --> 15:30.668
here that wanted money from the Ford Foundation, 
that we were just sort of a nuisance in this whole

15:11.500 --> 15:30.668
effort. So I went and got monies from the 
coordinating board for Texas colleges. What was

15:38.098 --> 15:41.423
it, under Title I of the Education Act? and also 
through my activities with the Urban Planning

15:41.690 --> 15:55.531
Assistance Program, 701, where we could channel 
monies to research work and so forth.

15:55.551 --> 16:10.313
When I was serving as a consultant to the United 
States High Commissioner for Germany, I received

15:55.551 --> 16:10.313
a note from the organizer of the first post-World 
War II planning exhibit and conference where the

16:11.238 --> 16:16.725
American exhibit was. That was in May or June 1950. 
The

16:22.151 --> 16:29.820
conference was supposed to be in the fall in 
Amsterdam. But there wasn't anything. It

16:31.322 --> 16:38.190
happened to fall between two chairs, namely the 
chair of Mr. Adams who was president of AAP at MIT,

16:38.457 --> 16:47.009
and Mr. Paul Oppermann, who has been the new 
president of AAP, who was in San Francisco at that

16:38.457 --> 16:47.009
time. Between the two, nothing had happened. So I 
wrote a blistering

16:48.812 --> 16:57.825
critique about this whole thing that among all the 
nations in the world, the United States was not

16:48.812 --> 16:57.825
represented. And the High Commissioner for 
Germany said, we have to get something there. Why

17:00.889 --> 17:02.571
don't you build something? I said, that's 
impossible. It takes much more. You have to have a

17:04.474 --> 17:05.916
story and so forth. So we said, okay, we have to have 
something. So I got the standard equipment on

17:08.115 --> 17:30.687
housing and planning, which every embassy has, 
which consists of three filing cabinets, steel

17:08.115 --> 17:30.687
filing cabinets, and a table full of planning 
literature, which was the representation of the

17:08.115 --> 17:30.687
United States, while London had a huge model about 
12 feet high with all the burning things to be

17:08.115 --> 17:30.687
reconstructed over London and, you know, that 
style. So that same year, I had a call from when I

17:34.263 --> 17:38.427
came back in 50 for a few months. I had a call from 
Washington saying, well, when can you have that

17:39.088 --> 17:43.413
exhibit ready? I said, what exhibit? Well, you 
criticize that we didn't have an exhibit. Can you

17:47.537 --> 17:49.219
build one now? I said, yes, of course. So here I was. 
And within two months, I had to set up an exhibit of

17:52.642 --> 18:00.270
American post-war planning efforts. So with the 
stationery from the State Department in

18:00.824 --> 18:10.976
Washington, I wrote to Mr. Bob Moses in New York, to 
people in Seattle, to people in anywhere,

18:00.824 --> 18:10.976
everywhere, big cities. And over the weekends, I 
went to these cities and got all their material,

18:11.196 --> 18:16.362
and we built here in Austin, Texas, School of 
Architecture. We built that exhibit, 600 pounds

18:16.722 --> 18:23.931
of it, and sent it over by airmail. And then I went 
back to Germany, and it was in Hanover, and went

18:23.951 --> 18:30.358
over the whole of Germany and England. so that is an 
interesting thing I still have all that material

18:31.452 --> 18:40.332
so one can see what we did if it's on loose or 
whatever you know yeah
