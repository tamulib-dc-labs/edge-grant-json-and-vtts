WEBVTT

00:01.027 --> 00:06.792
So it's logistics. You mentioned who's doing it 
for whom. United Kingdom has put in an ultra

00:11.557 --> 00:17.002
addition to their telescope. So you have to match 
the height of the existing. And we have to supply

00:22.347 --> 00:24.008
shock drawings. And I have to do the. How long have 
you been in that? About a year and a half. Is that

00:30.575 --> 00:32.657
what you've been in? No, no. I've done similar type 
work. But this particular job, I've been in

00:35.401 --> 00:47.715
estimating, and I've been in materials, and I've 
been in handling lumber yards for a large show.

00:47.735 --> 00:49.116
Should I say that? Well, I think this, I just was 
trying to elaborate a bit on this project for the

00:49.136 --> 00:57.466
United Kingdom. You can kind of see the irony. Yes. 
I was

00:59.650 --> 01:09.566
a low bidder. It's a competitive bid. It's not that 
we go out... I wish you wouldn't. I'm trying to get

01:18.920 --> 01:20.283
you off the subject. This is the way I do it usually.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.316
Is it a high security area? No, that one particular 
job wasn't. Have you ever been involved in a high

01:32.340 --> 01:46.313
security

01:32.340 --> 01:46.313
job?

01:46.553 --> 01:53.400
My temperature right now, you probably can't see 
it, but it's probably went up 20 degrees since you

01:46.553 --> 01:53.400
introduced the subject. of security.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.004
Would it make you feel better if we don't talk about 
it? Although I wonder what it is that... Well,

02:01.266 --> 02:09.635
because it's a potential dangerous situation. 
Not with us. No, no. But I don't know. But my

02:13.920 --> 02:18.966
temperature goes up and I do not really want it want 
to be involved with any military thing that

02:19.520 --> 02:31.931
involves security and have to get involved with 
that kind of stuff. I just freak out. Is it the fear

02:33.152 --> 02:36.175
that somebody would ask you to go for a security 
clearance? Security clearance, that's one of

02:36.195 --> 02:40.619
them. Probably the most important. Have you ever 
turned down a job because it was a security job? For

02:47.819 --> 02:49.002
just that reason.

02:51.548 --> 02:54.113
Big jobs, a lot of jobs. And did you ever know why it 
was that these jobs were turned down?

03:00.869 --> 03:04.056
About why you turned down this job? Sure.

03:15.011 --> 03:21.403
Are

03:15.011 --> 03:21.403
you sick? .

03:26.809 --> 03:33.395
.

03:33.415 --> 03:33.455
. . .

03:45.768 --> 03:45.788
. And most of the jobs he had during those years in 
Hawaii were for military projects. And he had to go

03:51.938 --> 03:57.453
through those centers day after day after day. And 
we're inside military installation. And then,

04:00.955 --> 04:06.028
you know, frivolous things, like we belong to 
tennis teams. And I don't know these

04:06.048 --> 04:10.098
temperatures. And so we sign up for ratings, and we 
go in, and we pass through this. And I think I've

04:13.848 --> 04:16.956
indicated, I don't know. She prefers to get into an 
argument with the sentries. You know how I like

04:24.224 --> 04:26.486
that. Oh, in

04:26.606 --> 04:36.077
anguish. In anguish.

04:42.333 --> 04:51.205
Because

04:42.333 --> 04:51.205
the whole island is full of military bases. And I 
just,

04:51.225 --> 04:55.892
I think that's enough of it. It's like going down 
the street to me that I never could figure why going

04:55.912 --> 04:57.854
through this scene. You know, answering in a 
backwards direction what happened is often hard.

05:02.240 --> 05:06.366
Do you think that is because of your status You 
know, I really...

05:22.229 --> 05:23.952
There's something about the military. There has 
to be a military. I'm not anti-military or

05:25.915 --> 05:29.721
anything like that. crazy about going off to any 
far away place. And I don't like anybody shooting

05:33.225 --> 05:35.948
at me, particularly. And I don't think anybody 
does. But in this case, it's strictly a security

05:38.671 --> 05:45.339
question. And it made you physically ill.

05:45.480 --> 05:55.692
You felt the hot breath of the authorities on your 
neck, that kind of thing.

06:01.628 --> 06:08.338
It's more animalistic than that. Yeah, it's just 
like you just don't walk into anybody's guns, so to

06:08.459 --> 06:21.499
speak. Just a hand on the shoulder kind of thing. 
Yeah, because I'm not looking forward to the

06:23.662 --> 06:30.252
actual physical handling. because I've been free 
too long to be tapped on the shoulder, told to go

06:31.312 --> 06:36.853
into this room and sit for three hours. I don't even 
like to sit in my doctor's office for one hour until

06:37.174 --> 06:42.655
he decides to see me. Let alone, so I'm not looking 
forward to this, you know, like in Hawaii they had,

06:43.090 --> 06:51.384
they were saying the illegal aliens, they were 
caught on the big island. They were, they might

06:52.106 --> 06:58.216
have to spend time in jail because the judge 
doesn't come from San Francisco every day. So, you

06:58.457 --> 07:03.225
see, you can get your handcuffs on, whatever they 
do nowadays, you know. So, you know, that kind of

07:03.205 --> 07:04.927
stuff. You know, like any free man, and that's the 
way I've always looked at myself, as a free man. And

07:10.792 --> 07:14.556
anything that endangers my freedom, I've looked 
at it that way. Not from any other viewpoint. Just

07:17.879 --> 07:18.880
my freedom. I want to go home. I want to do this. I 
want to go... And I don't want anybody to interfere

07:22.103 --> 07:26.327
with it. And I have done it now for almost 40 years. I 
was able to do it. And I think it... And I would... I

07:33.952 --> 07:42.663
don't forgive myself if I do anything stupid to 
stop it.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.685
All this other stuff, it's the freedom part. I 
don't like to be handled by anybody. Even my bosses

07:48.530 --> 07:55.980
on jobs, if they ask me too much, I just tell them, 
lay off. If they think they know everything, I just

07:56.280 --> 08:01.967
tell them, I don't like to be asked that. So it's 
gotten to be a freedom thing with me. I'm not fond of

08:10.175 --> 08:22.853
thinking some guy from the FBI is going to lead me 
down the hall and shove me into a car.

08:22.873 --> 08:25.417
It has to be him. I pushed it back for 40 years. If I 
had made my million, they would have never done it.

08:35.107 --> 08:40.900
We wouldn't have to worry about social security or 
her security. We wouldn't have to worry about

08:41.081 --> 08:46.613
anything. I would have just said, shut up.

08:52.842 --> 08:58.094
A lot of people are less concerned about that much 
freedom. I don't think anybody wants to be locked

08:58.115 --> 09:00.661
up. But a lot of people, if they know it's 
temporary, aren't bothered by the thought. I'm

09:08.359 --> 09:10.564
curious if you can think of anything that makes you 
like that. Can you think back on your experiences

09:10.544 --> 09:16.874
with that? Yes. Yes. Yeah, I think, right off, I 
think you kind of lead me into it. I, my father gave

09:24.726 --> 09:28.792
me a motorcycle. And I was able to go anywhere 
within 50 miles, anytime. And I, so I, I did a lot of

09:37.308 --> 09:42.473
traveling around my chalets and breakfast right 
there. Plus, my father was, I had all the free pass

09:43.634 --> 09:53.303
to go anywhere in Germany on the railroad, which I 
took advantage of in the summertime. I traveled

09:53.443 --> 09:55.424
all over. I've been to almost every place in 
Germany. So I've always been a traveler and was

09:58.267 --> 10:01.970
able to go anywhere. And it's a thing with me. I 
know. I told several bosses, you know, they asked

10:08.307 --> 10:16.859
me, you know, what is it, you know, anybody, what do 
you like? Leave me alone. Don't ask me. Tell me what

10:18.522 --> 10:23.589
you want done and let me do it. Now one company, 
there are not very many companies that like to do

10:24.811 --> 10:32.762
that because they want it totally controlled. I 
feel it's important that they control everything

10:32.995 --> 10:37.000
you do. But what comes to mind was this job, this big 
job with Morrison Canoes. We built maybe 3,000

10:43.227 --> 10:51.556
some odd residences for the military inside a 
crater in Hawaii. And I was in charge of all the

10:53.178 --> 10:54.660
lumber. And at the end of the job, they wanted a 
recap of the lumber. And it had to be done in board

11:01.396 --> 11:03.098
feet. Everything

11:03.479 --> 11:09.728
has to be converted from meters into inches to 
boards. It's very difficult. So I got a hold of the

11:12.912 --> 11:17.799
formula to see how to do it. But it wasn't very fast. 
So I simply told them. The office was in a long

11:23.768 --> 11:25.530
trailer. two traders and

11:25.898 --> 11:54.876
uh doors leading to your office and i said i'll tell 
you what i can do this job i can recap this number if i

11:25.898 --> 11:54.876
don't take any phone calls if i close my door and do 
the job and i said fine this is the way morrison

11:25.898 --> 11:54.876
canoeson operates great company they give you a 
job They ask you, do you need any help? Yes or no? And

12:00.403 --> 12:02.826
then you're responsible. You're the king for the 
job, and that's it. And it's your rear end if it's

12:05.790 --> 12:11.657
wrong.

12:11.717 --> 12:16.844
And it had five million board feet in that truck. 
And I turned my report in, and the guy that reviewed

12:18.646 --> 12:24.053
it said, You were often very close. They offered me 
a job in Saudi Arabia, which I couldn't take.

12:34.212 --> 12:34.672
That's right. And I wondered why you didn't want to 
get a job, 3,000 a month. It's like it

12:40.000 --> 12:49.895
would

12:40.000 --> 12:49.895
have taken a capsule. Honey, can you come back a 
little bit? Why maybe something in your past may

12:50.697 --> 12:52.960
have

12:56.534 --> 12:59.558
influences how you feel about freedom. I remember 
you telling me some things about how you felt when

12:59.578 --> 13:06.508
you were lying down with your leg up in the air. Very 
much. Way earlier. Not being able to move, you

13:08.731 --> 13:11.615
appreciate. Yes. And prior to that when you had 
diphtheria. Diphtheria and quarantine. So I

13:17.944 --> 13:20.027
think if you hold somebody down, for any length of 
time. I think his desire, he gets more motivated, I

13:21.940 --> 13:25.989
think. I remember one day, that one time my leg was 
up in a cast, you know, couldn't move. And the nurse

13:33.406 --> 13:37.375
came in and At 4 o'clock, she came in with a morphium 
to kill the pain. And she saw me in it, because I

13:43.349 --> 13:47.956
started to smile, and my eyes would light up. So 
they cut me off. As soon as they found out that I was

13:50.460 --> 13:57.551
looking forward to the morphium, they cut me off. I 
could hear her footsteps go down the hall, and

13:57.571 --> 14:03.199
that's probably where the morphium is. I'm going 
to get out there and get it. if I had been able to I

14:07.156 --> 14:36.876
don't know I'm sure I would have tried it they cut 
you off cold turkey like that they better put you in

14:07.156 --> 14:36.876
traction when they do that I understand you're 
doing that for fear of addiction but it's

14:07.156 --> 14:36.876
interesting because it also the message they're 
giving you is if you let us know how you feel and what

14:07.156 --> 14:36.876
you want we're going to take it away from you quite 
true that's a good point And I'm sometimes very

14:37.835 --> 14:40.920
careful to let people know what I want. You're 
correct, and that's very canny. Because...

14:45.126 --> 14:48.872
That's why she's a great psychologist. Yes. She 
does this... Sometimes I do hide that, or I just

14:49.853 --> 14:59.027
don't, you know, make it important because I know 
time and time again they screw you up, you know. If

14:59.047 --> 15:02.312
you look like you want it too much. Yeah, yeah. So I 
just... And I'd just go get it when I had my own time.

15:08.727 --> 15:09.067
Yes. Yeah, she picked up. I don't know where she got 
that. Oh. That was a cool one. I never even

15:14.693 --> 15:22.320
thought of that. Did they ever do a security check 
on you? No? I think so. How did you ever get out of it?

15:27.665 --> 15:28.927
Did you have to do high security work? Nobody ever 
stopped you? They weren't in those days. I had an

15:31.934 --> 15:42.087
argument once with the Marine Guard, and I was 
quite aggressive too, bluffing my way out of it.

15:42.107 --> 15:47.855
Oh, you had to turn in your car license and your 
driver's license. In other words, if you did

15:47.875 --> 15:53.042
something, they would get a hold of you, that type 
of thing. But it wasn't prior. You hadn't done

15:54.824 --> 15:58.509
anything, so they were probably not 
investigating you. They had all the information

15:58.529 --> 16:00.171
on you. to get you if they needed you. I think this 
brings up a kind of an interesting turn of events.

16:07.621 --> 16:12.606
We talked about that in the meeting yard. That was 
probably what we were thinking about. Yeah. Going

16:13.848 --> 16:15.710
over the Skopje every day. Over the pass. Koli Koli 
Pass. You know the famous Koli Koli Pass where the

16:16.791 --> 16:19.854
Japanese flew in? Oh, is that right? I drove over 
that every day. Gorgeous pass. It's the most

16:24.118 --> 16:26.200
beautiful trip. The Marines are really tough. And 
depending on which marine was on, sending them to

16:28.231 --> 16:37.762
the beach every day, would either hold you up and 
send you all the way, halfway around the island,

16:28.231 --> 16:37.762
back up the other side, or let you through. And most 
every day, he got through. And you asked how he

16:40.866 --> 16:45.891
managed to handle some of those things. And it 
occurs

16:45.912 --> 16:52.399
to me that this sort of is where I came into some of 
these scenes that he did. And my role was kind of set

16:52.548 --> 16:59.977
in a way by things he didn't handle for himself. I 
remember that particular thing with that Marine

17:01.519 --> 17:05.824
guard. She came home and told me about it. I picked 
him up, and I called the Marine commandant and

17:09.168 --> 17:15.114
said, how come my husband got hassled on that pass? 
And he would stand way back and let me do those

17:15.135 --> 17:21.542
things, which over the years, that type of 
behavior between the two of us. Ultimately, it

17:25.574 --> 17:27.577
caused a lot of confusion. Because I knew him as a 
very aggressive, capable kind of person, and yet

17:27.597 --> 17:39.377
how come I have to call up the Marine Commandant to 
get you through the gate? This sort of thing. But we

17:41.440 --> 17:44.365
never talked about it. I don't ever as that came out 
last night that I do not feel, I don't ever want to,

17:47.358 --> 17:58.731
did not want to try to put anything over on these 
people. I feel very strongly about that. It isn't

18:01.594 --> 18:04.538
anything that I wanted to do. And why in the hell I 
fell into these jobs, I don't know. It's the only

18:10.525 --> 18:16.892
job that was available at the time. It always came 
about through referrals of sorts. It was so

18:21.707 --> 18:23.610
flattering, you couldn't turn it down. You could 
not. It was not only the only one, but you were

18:24.572 --> 18:27.376
introduced. Like this one of at Schofield, I had a

18:28.938 --> 18:42.660
reputation now for running these lumber yards, 
you see, because these are huge projects. And in no

18:42.893 --> 18:45.456
time at all, things get screwed up. So I was getting 
the reputation of straightening out these

18:46.117 --> 18:51.744
screwed up lumber yards. So then it's hard to pass 
up a recommendation like that. I mean, what would I

18:55.028 --> 18:56.590
say? You're caught between being complimented 
and being concerned about going back into the

18:56.850 --> 19:01.536
military. I became known as the one that just 
called Dennis. They begged me to come to work. And

19:06.241 --> 19:11.668
since there were several of them in a row, big jobs. 
gross $10, $20 million jobs that they were, you

19:12.037 --> 19:20.566
see. And they went kind of bang, bang, bang. I was 
probably employed for five or six years in these

19:23.489 --> 19:30.096
jobs, you see. Anything, any particular 
interesting ones where security was so tough and

19:30.116 --> 19:38.504
still nothing happened? No. Never not. It's all 
new construction, and you've got maybe 500

19:39.425 --> 19:45.691
carpenters running around, running around. I 
mean, a tremendous job. There would be no, you

19:49.074 --> 19:51.577
couldn't get any work done. And some of them were 
prison, they were jailbirds. Oh, I could tell you a

19:57.983 --> 20:07.592
story, the framing contractor, that he was an 
ex-con. And let me change the subject for a second.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.683
OK. Let me think.

20:19.548 --> 20:21.011
Do you ever vote in Hawaii? No, please. No, you 
don't vote? No. OK. You can vote anywhere. This is

20:25.017 --> 20:26.079
another real confusion. That's another thing. 
Why don't you vote? Let's get this guy out of

20:27.381 --> 20:30.747
office, or let's get this guy into office. Mind 
you, I don't vote many times. But I sit back and say,

20:32.690 --> 20:35.014
well, I

20:39.213 --> 20:46.123
I tuned it all out, and I won't listen to it for 25 
years, because it's always the same old crap. But

20:46.143 --> 20:53.413
he was very politically astute,

20:46.143 --> 20:53.413
and he could never erase it. I certainly don't ever 
want to, you know, I wouldn't want ever to be

20:53.433 --> 21:07.532
presented that I was trying to put, you know, be 
smart-ass or something like that, because it just

20:53.433 --> 21:07.532
happened I fell into these jobs, and good-paying 
jobs, and really interesting jobs. I mean, you

21:12.102 --> 21:19.333
talk about action and, you know, doing something 
worthwhile, you get, you know, you're going into a

21:12.102 --> 21:19.333
crater. Well, how many people get a chance to go 
into a crater, an extinct crater, and build 3,000

21:19.693 --> 21:25.302
homes? You know, I mean, the The very idea is worth 
the risk. I'm talking about the fun of doing the

21:33.060 --> 21:34.942
job. To hell with that other part. I'm not 
interested in that other part. I don't want them

21:39.588 --> 21:43.252
ever to look bad. So please, whatever we do, let's 
not make them look bad.

21:51.262 --> 21:52.284
Well, that's a summer. I don't know. I don't know. 
It sounds like you really do enjoy the kind of work

21:57.428 --> 22:01.713
you've been doing. It's high pressure, but you 
really enjoy it. You had said yesterday that

22:04.616 --> 22:09.902
originally you wanted to be an architect, so you 
had signed that space. Well, every father wants

22:09.922 --> 22:12.785
his son to be an architect. Well, of course, this is 
still in the building era. You've got an

22:15.428 --> 22:16.730
incredibly related job. Have you ever regretted 
not being an architect, or are you just as happy

22:16.810 --> 22:20.774
that you want to sign? Less and less. I was talking 
to my wife all the time, Jane, Because I deal not

22:24.445 --> 22:25.727
with them. I talk to them almost daily. I go to their 
offices. I make submittals. We discuss problems.

22:32.375 --> 22:36.440
They approve my shop drawings, or they 
disapprove, and they make . I have a drawing desk,

22:37.861 --> 22:44.830
and it's this high with plans, plans everywhere. 
They all smell of ammonia. And you start leaving a

22:49.589 --> 22:57.441
brand new plan, this is maybe this thick of a big 
building, and you work on it for two hours. The

22:58.743 --> 23:03.831
ammonia get into your breath and into your hands, 
and you cut your finger on the paper. I mean, if you

23:04.752 --> 23:13.265
had to do this, if this is all you had to do, which is 
what practically an architect has to do, he is over

23:04.752 --> 23:13.265
those plans for two years. It takes him two to three 
years to... to make this stack of plans and write

23:15.830 --> 23:18.935
the specs. So I know it's a very, I have more respect 
for it the longer I'm in it. And anybody that wants

23:24.845 --> 23:32.878
to do it and take that responsibility and the 
changes and the knowledge that it takes. 50,000

23:32.898 --> 23:36.724
products and they're, you know, They have all my 
admiration and respect. I couldn't have done it

23:41.466 --> 23:46.695
because as a young man, I used to know a young man 
that I played tennis with. Good tennis player. And

23:48.900 --> 23:50.342
we saw less and less of him. And one day I met him 
downtown in San Francisco in a financial

23:50.723 --> 23:56.073
district. And I said, where have you been? I 
haven't seen you. And he says, oh, the studies is,

23:58.878 --> 24:05.345
you know, I'm getting close to the finals and all 
that, to be an architect. I just can't. He was white

24:05.646 --> 24:11.713
in the face, you know, hadn't

24:05.646 --> 24:11.713
seen the sun for, I don't know how long. I said, no, 
not at that time, you know. No, there's so many

24:15.016 --> 24:20.142
related jobs in the building that, building 
business. But I know it's a great, I met some of the

24:20.162 --> 24:23.907
greatest architects. I met Ron, Ronstead, Joe 
Ronstead. It's spelled J-O. It's a good Swedish

24:31.210 --> 24:32.580
type name. And it's one of the emails. beautiful 
skyscrapers in Hollywood, most elegant

24:35.969 --> 24:43.078
buildings, and have lunch with them. We talked 
about, I was in marketing for Morris and Knudsen.

24:49.707 --> 24:52.350
They didn't want to let me go, so they put me into, 
didn't know what to do. They said, get us another

24:52.370 --> 24:56.856
job, Dennis, so we don't have to leave the islands. 
I know nothing about marketing. I had to write

24:58.959 --> 25:05.487
reports to Boise, Idaho every week to the vice 
presidency. So I pounded the pavement around and

25:05.888 --> 25:17.870
lo and behold I ran into a lead and we got on the 
select list of three contractors bidding and boom

25:05.888 --> 25:17.870
we got the job. Five million dollars building 
resort villas on Otter Island. You know, so I did my

25:24.046 --> 25:26.069
job. That's brilliant. Hitting a bull's eye. And 
the Vice President said, well, and then as he came

25:29.053 --> 25:34.762
signing, the first three parts were pretty bad. 
Chicken scratches. But they got better. Every

25:38.227 --> 25:40.290
time you send one in, they got better. You got the 
hang of it. It's part of your statement yesterday

25:41.812 --> 25:44.876
about always being a quick learner. It isn't just 
in the athletics. Yeah. Well, when her took me on,

25:48.922 --> 25:53.749
we knew Is Herb Klein? No, Herb Lipkin, the one that 
gave me that first job in the building business.

26:02.364 --> 26:04.186
When was that? Must have been in 52, 53. We

26:07.149 --> 26:14.597
can probably get some of the things on there. Is he 
on there, Lipkin? So 52, we can, he took you out of 52

26:17.660 --> 26:22.825
in the building trade business. And he's really 
the first person that

26:23.193 --> 26:30.360
gave you a... Got you out of the kitchen. Got me out 
of the dishwashing and the fruit picking and that

26:30.380 --> 26:36.345
kind of stuff, the odd jobs. And there was also a 
brand new product that was called pre-hung doors.

26:44.192 --> 26:50.618
Up to that point, the carpenter would hang each 
door by hand, inches and... Curl the holes and

26:51.172 --> 26:52.876
everything. It took him maybe a day, day and a half, 
a door or something like that. How did you meet him?

26:58.648 --> 26:59.730
Well, through Georgette. His girlfriend had 
taken lessons from me. Oh, I see. And she must have

27:03.498 --> 27:05.983
said something good about me. Well, sure. He saw 
me. I played tennis against him. one day in

27:11.320 --> 27:15.225
Berkeley and he asked me what I was going to do the 
following year. He says, I'm going into a brand new

27:15.866 --> 27:22.794
business and I might have a job for you as a 
salesman. Come and see me when you come back from

27:22.834 --> 27:25.477
the ski season. He figured his timetable was going 
to be about that. His father had gone broke in the

27:28.741 --> 27:31.364
glass business. He had bid a job, one of those big 
track jobs, near Sausalito in that area, in fact,

27:36.143 --> 27:48.921
north of Gold Gate Bridge, and somehow 
miscalculated the glass or the breakage or

27:36.143 --> 27:48.921
something and lost its shirt. So rather than 
filing bankruptcy, they decided to go into

27:51.325 --> 28:03.602
another line of work, still called himself 
Broadway Glass, but he opened up another company

27:51.325 --> 28:03.602
called Allied Building Supply. And that's what I 
started with him. And after about three days of

28:07.720 --> 28:13.668
briefing what that was, he sent me out on a job. You 
know, you know as much as I do, so go on out and start

28:15.150 --> 28:18.735
selling. So I went out. The first guy, I remember, 
was a carpenter. He was hanging a door. and he had

28:26.178 --> 28:32.927
saw horses and he had his door on there in some old 
suite or something. And it was a complete bust.

28:36.992 --> 28:39.495
Then of course I thought about it, this is the wrong 
guy to sell. You don't sell the guy that, I'm going

28:40.116 --> 28:44.542
to practically replace his job with a pre-hung 
door. So then I, you know, went to the contractor or

28:48.858 --> 28:53.245
somebody else that doesn't hang the Torah. I mean, 
it seemed, at first, a logical place to start, but

28:53.626 --> 28:56.891
it wasn't. I'm calling you from Macy's about 
gimbals. Yeah, right. Do you ever, have you ever

29:02.140 --> 29:06.387
found yourself doing volunteer work? Red Cross or 
Boy Scouts? Yeah, we did. In fact, we had pictures,

29:10.434 --> 29:13.178
remember, in Athens? I did for charity. Junior 
Davis Cup. Junior Davis Cup team I had. Oh, that's

29:21.087 --> 29:21.608
nice. I have pictures made of big macho. With Mark 
or something? Yeah, Mark was one of the, I had five

29:29.096 --> 29:35.163
or six volunteer guys. Most of my students are, 
they got scholarships. One girl got on the Olympic

29:38.367 --> 29:42.391
team skiing. Is that right? And several guys went 
to Dartmouth for the skiing. Well, that speaks

29:49.226 --> 29:53.037
well for you. So you never got into the Rotarians or 
the Lions or the... I had a million chances. I got

29:58.524 --> 30:01.067
invited to join the Elks and everything. You 
couldn't figure out how to understand why. The

30:04.452 --> 30:07.095
Elks have the most beautiful place in Honolulu. 
The best piece of... And the guy who wants to get me

30:07.155 --> 30:11.661
in there is the guy from the OSS. He says, I can get 
you in. Why would you not want to? Well, you do have

30:19.172 --> 30:20.153
to. They do run a security check on you. You think 
so? You told me. Oh.

30:29.930 --> 30:32.633
You know, in six months, how many things you're 
going to be able to do? You're going to be able to

30:32.733 --> 30:35.235
join things. You're going to be able to vote. Well, 
the only thing I couldn't do was I knew I couldn't

30:41.160 --> 30:45.904
become president, so I'd given up on that. Well, 
you might be able to pull it off. I wouldn't want it

30:49.407 --> 30:50.748
if I did. Is that running? Is that

30:53.598 --> 31:02.927
running? Yes.

31:07.503 --> 31:10.850
I was watching Candy. I thought she was just taking 
notes. I didn't know he had flipped the switch. Oh,

31:13.636 --> 31:14.919
yes, he did way back. So it's been on for most of the 
time. My hands keep running out of ink. We're

31:17.905 --> 31:19.429
concerned about you. We're so full from oysters. 
Beautiful oysters. They're very sweet. Yes. And

31:26.183 --> 31:37.433
the Hawaiian oysters are really good, but a little 
different flavor and much larger and much

31:26.183 --> 31:37.433
tougher. Yes. They haven't had Hawaiian oysters, 
but I do know they're very good here. When we made

31:40.656 --> 31:52.528
the choice, I'm kind of curious when it comes to 
shellfish or seafood,

31:40.656 --> 31:52.528
and I don't like a lot of sausages. So I chose the 
brush shak. Well,

31:53.909 --> 32:13.189
they almost

31:53.909 --> 32:13.189
tucked us out of it then at the desk. We asked for 
directions, you know, downstairs. two people,

32:18.158 --> 32:20.260
one in the elevators. Oh, no, you don't want to go to 
Galveston. There's too much traffic unless it is

32:22.803 --> 32:26.246
time of day. You've got to go at 9 o'clock in the 
morning. And they were wrong. They were wrong. It

32:31.031 --> 32:32.012
was the breeze. Because we just breezed through. 
The traffic was all coming in. They were probably

32:35.496 --> 32:37.177
thinking middle of the summer. They forgot this is 
February. And then when we started on the way back,

32:38.979 --> 32:45.325
the traffic was going in the opposite direction. 
So we were really lucked out as far as... Amen.

32:50.896 --> 32:54.981
Everything was fine until I turned off the freeway 
and had to look for a safe place. I'm so sorry. It

32:55.342 --> 32:58.065
never occurred to me about getting you back again. 
Well, the Safe Restore at home in the islands has

32:58.085 --> 33:01.709
everything. Everything. Everything. Well, it's 
the hub of the Pacific Basin. It has stuff from all

33:05.314 --> 33:06.615
over the world. You can go into their deli section. 
You really can come up with some kind of fun things

33:08.157 --> 33:12.222
to serve. And they have a whole liquor department. 
Yeah. So not only did they not have the liquor

33:19.482 --> 33:24.488
department, but they don't have the mix. They have 
only their own in Kragmont or whatever, whatever

33:24.828 --> 33:29.574
it is. They didn't even stock any Schweppes. No, 
I'm thinking. Some tonic in it would be nice. The

33:38.765 --> 33:40.848
Schweppes tonic. Were you ever church-going 
folks? No, we're not really. Mm-hmm. By choice or

33:50.110 --> 34:03.105
just by circumstance or it doesn't make any 
difference.

34:03.285 --> 34:06.809
Oh, is that right? Old Baptist revivals. This

34:11.154 --> 34:17.161
is the neighborhood for it. Oh, Sunday morning. 
There's

34:19.068 --> 34:31.002
a little story that might shed some light on me. 
Usually, I have to get a job. And I can't apply at IBM

34:34.306 --> 34:40.393
and work my way up to vice president. So you have to 
be creative. Because I can't tell Gene. So after

34:49.595 --> 35:02.129
the kids graduated, everybody was out of high 
school in Palo Alto, Mark and Cheryl. So that left

35:02.149 --> 35:03.791
us. And Jean wanted to get out as close to the ocean. 
She's got this thing about the ocean.

35:13.803 --> 35:14.523
That's her freedom. That's her freedom. Yeah, she 
had her thing. We're soulmates. She didn't know

35:20.448 --> 35:23.752
it, you see, that I have my problem. And she was 
always saying, you're so understanding about

35:24.673 --> 35:29.740
mine, you see. Well, she was understanding about 
mine, you see. So I gave her hers. And so she said,

35:36.309 --> 35:41.556
let's get out of Palo Alto and get to the ocean 
somehow. So she found this cute little house in Rio

35:42.278 --> 35:48.691
Del Mar, comes home one day and found it. Okay, we 
moved to Rio Del Mar. Gorgeous area, lovely area,

35:55.004 --> 36:00.475
near Santa Cruz. But what do I do? Unemployed? Jean 
had a job, she would, she commuted back, but it was,

36:04.958 --> 36:16.029
you know, we needed income and I couldn't very well 
just stay home. So, I looked in the Yellow Pages,

36:16.049 --> 36:23.416
under tennis clubs, and there were two. And one was 
called, uh, neighbors swimming tennis club. And

36:31.644 --> 36:34.307
they said, yeah, we might need a part-time girl. 
Come on up. So, Mr. and Mrs. Beaver

36:38.381 --> 36:58.945
got the job, providing I

36:38.381 --> 36:58.945
play a match to show whether I can play with the 
outgoing part-time tennis pro.

37:00.022 --> 37:01.984
Okay, so we set up the match. Now, I had not played 
tennis in 10 years. In Palo Alto, we played golf. It

37:07.291 --> 37:09.934
was too cold to play tennis. Not in 10 years. So I 
hustled up some tennis shorts, or they were

37:12.838 --> 37:19.806
actually walking shorts, white walking shorts. I 
know they're called for tight end binding. And a

37:23.571 --> 37:27.936
tennis racket, and showed up for my match. with 
this guy, Dewey Rayburn, who became one of my best

37:29.840 --> 37:40.733
friends, who was about my age, and worked for the 
telephone company, part-time. He loved tennis,

37:40.753 --> 37:45.779
just talking about tennis.

37:45.799 --> 37:59.475
So we started our match, and somehow Cheryl, our 
daughter, drifted by, came by and watched the

37:45.799 --> 37:59.475
match for some reason. It was a grueling match. I 
won in five sets. Should have had a heart attack,

38:05.029 --> 38:08.113
you know. I get very red in the face, but 
fortunately it's not the heart. It's something

38:11.677 --> 38:18.266
else that, probably from one of my other ailments, 
some heat stroke I had when I was young. My cooling

38:18.306 --> 38:22.631
system is not the world's greatest, but my heart is 
good. But anyway, I won in five sets. And Cheryl

38:24.894 --> 38:28.939
came to me later and said, Dennis, I can see You had 
to win this match. How you did it, I don't know. I

38:35.653 --> 38:40.219
could see you were actually not, you were in 
terrible shape. Let's face it, I was overweight,

38:40.539 --> 38:44.564
probably 20 pounds, had not played. And I just made 
this up. I had to make this up. There had to be

38:49.950 --> 38:55.296
somewhere in my memory, 10 years ago, I knew how to 
hit a forehand and a backhand and a serve. I knew it.

38:56.498 --> 38:57.139
I had done it. So I recalled it. I insisted on it. the 
will yeah yeah about when when was this you think

39:00.863 --> 39:26.955
let's put this in perspective and cheryl could 
probably tell the story better than i can 1971 yeah

39:00.863 --> 39:26.955
yeah she always told me she told me 1970. cheryl 
calls you dennis

39:00.863 --> 39:26.955
that's

39:00.863 --> 39:26.955
nice it's very informal yeah They're both your 
natural children, but not your natural children.

39:32.471 --> 39:43.167
How old were they

39:32.471 --> 39:43.167
when you got together? Cheryl was 16. And Mark was

39:43.487 --> 39:47.934
16. Mark was 13. Let's see if the speaking up is far 
away.

39:55.133 --> 40:01.381
So it was a closeness that came from that, when she 
told me that. I could see we became closer. And yet I

40:07.329 --> 40:08.791
never knew that happened. Didn't you? No. I 
thought you knew that story. Was there a lot of

40:11.655 --> 40:12.596
strife? I find that very nearing. Was there ever 
difficulty with Cheryl and Mark? Is there a third

40:17.122 --> 40:19.004
child, or is there just Cheryl? No. I see. I see. And 
both were your children, Jane, when you came into

40:21.007 --> 40:23.470
the marriage? Well, there's very different 
children. Cheryl was the one who said, when I

40:26.174 --> 40:33.205
announced that Dennis and I were leaving to go get 
married, she said, well, that's all. I'm just

40:33.225 --> 40:34.447
going to kill myself. She's going to kill herself? 
She did tell me, while you're gone, I'm going to

40:36.530 --> 40:39.234
kill myself. Why do you think she said that? I don't 
know. She's a very, well, you used the word, Candy,

40:42.760 --> 40:47.888
sensory person. Didn't you? I never heard of it. I 
may have. I don't. I forget what I say. What was

40:51.398 --> 40:52.058
those two? You said sensory, and what was the other 
one? Oh, when I was talking about sensitizers and

40:54.121 --> 40:56.844
repressors. Sensitizer. She's a sensitizer. 
Yes. She worries about everything that could

41:00.868 --> 41:03.311
happen. Exactly. You know, talking about 
sensitizers and repressors. Yes. Cheryl and Mark

41:08.256 --> 41:13.902
and I have been threesome for quite a few years. And 
actually someone very kind of different, as it

41:15.004 --> 41:18.988
turns out. They didn't know how. No, they knew. 
Children are much more intuitive about things

41:22.301 --> 41:26.606
like that. So they don't block out a lot

41:27.307 --> 41:37.460
of information that they're getting. How long 
have you lived by yourself with just the two kids?

41:47.092 --> 41:47.432
Divorced in 1958. You were divorced in 1958?

41:55.773 --> 42:00.101
Yes, yes.

42:00.121 --> 42:07.094
They grew very attached

42:00.121 --> 42:07.094
to their mother, for sure. Did you move around 
during those two, during that time? Did you? which

42:17.727 --> 42:35.118
is true, we did move around a lot, but I've always 
been very anchored to a job of some kind. So

42:36.701 --> 42:40.026
movement had a lot to do with jobs. Like 10 years in 
one job, I may have moved 10 times to different

42:42.601 --> 42:47.425
houses or different areas and drove 85 miles to get 
whatever. She was one of the first ones to get an

42:47.505 --> 42:54.392
executive position with an insurance company. 
Man, that's enormous. On the first training

42:55.493 --> 42:56.994
program. No, we're not going to talk about that. 
All right. I want to go back to one thing that I think

42:59.797 --> 43:12.068
is said, which I find endearing, that when I was, 
something about your understanding of my

43:12.672 --> 43:15.436
fugitive kinds of behavior. And one of the things 
that has kept us together through some of the most

43:15.456 --> 43:23.849
difficult times, and we have a song that we like. It 
was my song that I heard first, and then he

43:23.869 --> 43:27.294
finalizes. Setting Fancy Free, a Western song. 
Setting Fancy Free. He always did give me that kind

43:32.041 --> 43:36.147
of freedom. Which you needed. And we kind of gave 
each other an anchor. When I'm swinging way out

43:39.111 --> 43:42.156
there, he's and anger for me. Vice versa. But we 
didn't know when we were doing it. Can I tell the

43:49.393 --> 43:52.758
story about the honeymoon? I don't know. Would you 
like to leave the room for a minute? Would I like to

43:56.683 --> 43:57.905
leave both? I don't know where we're at in your 
order of... Priorities? Priorities. The

44:06.055 --> 44:07.777
honeymoon, you said. Yeah, OK. We'd gotten 
married, because it's such a good story, because

44:07.837 --> 44:13.544
it has to do with the anxiety, my anxiety. Well, 
that's all right. Wait a minute. You don't have to

44:14.585 --> 44:17.109
leave, because you may need to correct the truth. 
My anxiety and my security, and my security, and my

44:17.169 --> 44:20.212
worry about security. Yes. OK. Great wedding. Let 
me back up one step. You met at a Singles YMCA dance.

44:28.703 --> 44:30.165
Yes, yes. What attracted you to her in the first 
place? Red hair? Her red hair and her red skirt and

44:33.952 --> 44:38.197
the way we danced. You know, like, wow.

44:43.802 --> 44:46.644
And this was in 19 what, 60? 64. 64.

44:54.352 --> 44:54.652
Oh, okay. 64 and about, yeah, I remember I just got 
back, I had gone on... two weeks a year or whatever

44:59.963 --> 45:01.965
it is. I went to Palm Springs. It had to be around 
Easter. I got back. It was about three or four weeks

45:06.409 --> 45:08.351
later. It must have been about May of 64. May of 64. 
What city was this in? Palo Alto, California.

45:16.198 --> 45:17.139
Well, you were in Palo Alto. Went to a YMCA singles 
dance.

45:24.005 --> 45:26.407
Did you go often to the singles dances? Yes. There 
was often, not every dance, but I tried to get out

45:27.976 --> 45:38.648
because I do tend to sometimes become a recluse. I 
would get my world schmertz.

45:47.118 --> 45:51.944
But I made myself go to these things.

45:52.184 --> 45:55.468
It wasn't easy because, like I say, You cannot turn 
on your natural charm. You cannot, hey, you know,

45:58.407 --> 46:07.562
talk about your school days and just kind of have a 
fun old time, you know. So what do you talk about?

46:08.764 --> 46:09.906
It's not easy. Because you're concerned that... 
Your love life as a fugitive is extremely

46:11.148 --> 46:15.215
difficult. Yes, I would imagine.

46:19.001 --> 46:20.764
But this one, you know, seemed to...
