WEBVTT

00:06.258 --> 00:11.683
This is a History 374 project for Dr. Anderson's 
class in the fall of 1984. Speak to you there. And

00:15.167 --> 00:18.069
we'll be talking with a man. His name is Vic Mazufi. 
Vic Mazufi, who went to Peru in 1971 through 1974 as

00:20.412 --> 00:29.100
a Peace Corps volunteer. And Vic, you want to tell 
us a little bit about your background as far as your

00:30.021 --> 00:35.286
education? Were you born maybe a little bit? Yeah, 
I grew up in Northwest New Jersey and graduated

00:37.873 --> 00:44.762
from high school and attended Georgetown 
University in Washington. I was a language major

00:45.823 --> 00:47.005
there. Spanish was my major. And on graduation, 
I'd always been interested in Latin America. And I

00:54.795 --> 01:06.049
saw Peace Corps as a vehicle sort of to travel and to 
gain a little experience down there and perhaps

00:54.795 --> 01:06.049
get a better idea of what I want to do in the future.

01:06.873 --> 01:12.642
It was accepted upon application, and about a 
month after graduation, we went into training. It

01:13.484 --> 01:23.440
was a three-month training program, starting out 
in Vermont, and then to Mexico and finally Hawaii

01:13.484 --> 01:23.440
for some technical training in rice production. 
And then about two weeks of in-country training in

01:24.962 --> 01:29.910
Peru, and we were finally sent to our sites. OK, but 
that was in 1971, correct? 1971, the latter part of

01:32.689 --> 01:35.972
1971. OK, how did you go about getting there? Did 
you fly? Did you drive? Oh, no. It was a group of

01:43.739 --> 01:46.041
about 34 volunteers. And we were flown down. I 
believe we left from Miami International Airport

01:50.325 --> 01:54.008
and flew right to the airport. OK. What all did you 
take? What did they tell you? Did they give you a

01:56.871 --> 01:59.273
list of certain things you could take? Basic 
clothing. I was in a coastal

02:01.000 --> 02:12.176
semi-arid climate, so there wasn't a lot of heavy 
clothing that needed to be taken. Technical

02:12.196 --> 02:19.167
references, textbooks, and other material that 
was provided during the Peace Corps training.

02:19.187 --> 02:22.571
Things we need in the field later on as far as 
technical material. A lot of extra reading

02:23.813 --> 02:26.357
material just for the The times that you're alone 
or you need to relax. But you have your supplies for

02:31.687 --> 02:41.660
your kitchen and your bedding and all could be 
acquired in the country, so there's no problem

02:31.687 --> 02:41.660
with really burdening yourself with a whole lot of 
extra baggage. Were you by a major city or anything

02:41.921 --> 02:44.444
while you were there? I was about 10 minutes away 
from a city of about 200,000 people, although I was

02:44.464 --> 02:54.257
located in a town of about 3,000 to 4,000 people, a 
small rural ag community. Okay. What was your

02:56.220 --> 02:58.403
first impression as you... Maybe you got off the 
plane and you got to your site. As I got to my site, a

03:00.950 --> 03:03.735
lot of dust. A lot of dust. And it was hot, dry, 
because it was on the desert. I think the whole

03:11.988 --> 03:17.376
three years I was there, I believe it rained about a 
total of maybe two inches in three years. Three

03:17.536 --> 03:21.042
inches?

03:21.062 --> 03:21.162
Yeah. Okay. What did your average day consist of 
there in the rice? Well, it depends. When I first

03:27.699 --> 03:35.749
got there, it was a matter of getting to know the 
people, getting to know the farmers, the

03:27.699 --> 03:35.749
problems, the people I was working with. The work 
they involved over a period of time at first was

03:36.830 --> 03:43.558
just getting familiar with the site. And then as I 
became familiar with the site and the work I was

03:44.079 --> 03:49.686
trying to do and the farmers I was working with, A 
typical work day, say, six to eight months down the

03:50.712 --> 04:14.853
road, once I felt at ease there, going out and 
visiting individual farmers in the field,

03:50.712 --> 04:14.853
discussing with them some of the work we've been 
doing and what problems they may be having, and

03:50.712 --> 04:14.853
trying to work out some kind of a solution, make 
formative recommendations to whatever problem

03:50.712 --> 04:14.853
they may have had. Is there any isolated 
experiences that may be good or bad that stick out

04:14.873 --> 04:19.757
in your mind? that you carry with you? I wouldn't 
say any particular isolated incidents. A lot of

04:27.346 --> 04:30.190
minor things, but nothing that really would stand 
out. Just the overall experience and the sense of

04:30.570 --> 04:35.336
accomplishment after the job is done. We haven't 
gone into it yet, but the work I was actually doing

04:37.239 --> 04:48.934
was the introduction of an improved rice variety 
to the local rice farmers in the Santa Valley.

04:51.040 --> 05:16.288
Over a period of three years after installing test 
plots and the farmers learning how to grow this

04:51.040 --> 05:16.288
particular variety and seeing the results it had 
and that it was outperforming the traditional

04:51.040 --> 05:16.288
variety that had been growing for many years, 
seeing that they were changing over to this new

04:51.040 --> 05:16.288
variety we were trying to introduce and accepting 
it and growing it and having very good results, the

04:51.040 --> 05:16.288
yield was increased. not double, but at least by a 
good 30 to 40 percent. The grain quality was much

05:20.338 --> 05:24.344
better than the traditional variety they'd been 
growing. The vegetative period was a lot shorter,

05:25.505 --> 05:28.850
so it gave them time for a double crop. They were 
cropping, intercropping with peas and beans, so

05:28.870 --> 05:36.221
their income was increased. And just the fact that 
I saw a lot of people responding to the efforts

05:36.321 --> 05:43.812
we've been making in introducing this variety, 
and planting it, and eventually the variety was,

05:44.281 --> 05:50.151
had replaced the traditional variety by the time I 
had left. It was a predominant variety in that

05:50.171 --> 05:51.754
valley. Did the farmers, did they welcome you into 
their fields? Were they kind of... They welcomed

05:56.782 --> 05:59.507
me, but with a certain bit of skepticism. I was a 
Yankee, a young gringo. And sometimes they use

06:03.434 --> 06:05.797
that term. Did they respect your education? Yeah, 
but they still wanted me to prove myself. And I

06:11.084 --> 06:12.607
learned as I went. I made a few mistakes in the 
beginning. And I tried to disguise them as well as I

06:14.269 --> 06:17.173
could. But I think overall, over time, the 
confidence that I displayed, I think they

06:17.213 --> 06:25.124
accepted it. And they came to trust me and to 
believe that I had the confidence. to show them a

06:31.312 --> 06:34.717
few new ideas or techniques. Did they believe in 
American education? The thing is, yeah, they had

06:36.580 --> 06:54.989
an assumption that Americans, yes, were 
well-educated and should know what they were

06:36.580 --> 06:54.989
talking about, but it comes down to an individual 
one-to-one relationship where you have to prove

06:36.580 --> 06:54.989
yourself to that farmer and gain their trust. Once 
you gain the trust, then Whether they respect you

06:57.603 --> 07:14.043
or not will come, but they have to trust you first 
before they'll open up and you can be more sincere

06:57.603 --> 07:14.043
with them and try to teach if you can. But the thing 
is, the whole time I was there, I think I was

07:14.383 --> 07:20.871
learning more from them than I was actually able to 
teach. But it's the ideas, the... techniques that

07:24.957 --> 07:53.378
i was picking up from the whole spectrum of farmers 
in that area and getting an idea of the proper

07:24.957 --> 07:53.378
techniques to use and then focusing on farmers 
that had problems individual farmers that were

07:24.957 --> 07:53.378
not as managing the crops as well as the better ones 
and bringing those better ideas to the farmers

07:24.957 --> 07:53.378
that i saw were marginal that that needed help okay 
what was the basic uh economy that time in peru was

07:24.957 --> 07:53.378
it pretty poor Did a few people control a lot of the 
aristocratic? Yeah, it was, but just before I got

07:57.778 --> 07:59.219
there. But I got there soon as the, there was a 
military coup in 1968. And it was a leftist

08:04.524 --> 08:10.009
military dictatorship that took over the 
country. And what they tried to do was expropriate

08:10.850 --> 08:21.240
a lot of the large land holdings and turn it back 
over to the former owners in the form of a

08:10.850 --> 08:21.240
agricultural production co-op. They did this not 
only in agriculture, but in industry. The steel

08:25.184 --> 08:31.251
industry was expropriated from private 
ownership and turned back over to the workers. The

08:31.632 --> 08:38.339
fishing industry was one of the biggest 
industries in Peru, and a lot of the light industry

08:31.632 --> 08:38.339
as well. And it was in a state of flux the whole time I 
was there. New owners, a lot of government

08:45.268 --> 08:49.973
intervention, poor planning, poor management. 
Production went down a lot in the steel industry,

08:50.594 --> 08:55.039
the fishing industry. Not only because of the 
management problems, but because of changes in

08:55.492 --> 09:01.921
weather patterns and ocean currents. The 
anchovy, which was the main fish that they were

09:01.981 --> 09:10.754
harvesting, sort of disappeared for a few years. 
And they lost a lot of their foreign exchange

09:11.935 --> 09:14.880
because of that. And agriculture production went 
down because of the co-ops. A lot of the social and

09:17.844 --> 09:24.233
technical problems they were having and the 
transformation of ownership. The economy was

09:24.668 --> 09:29.198
relatively poor. It's a developing country and a 
relatively poor country. Is there a significant

09:32.706 --> 09:34.910
class structure? Yeah, there was. Yes, there's a 
very small class structure. upper class and a very

09:42.370 --> 10:08.631
large lower class with a minimal middle class 
which this is mainly viewed your merchants and

09:42.370 --> 10:08.631
retailers and some of your industrial workers but 
it's the bulk of the population is agricultural

09:42.370 --> 10:08.631
and poor okay did any problems that was that were 
occurring in chile right uh at that time period

09:42.370 --> 10:08.631
down there with uh allende Did that affect you in 
any way in Peru? Were the people aware of it in Peru?

10:14.135 --> 10:15.937
Yes, it came out in the Peruvian press. And the 
press wasn't controlled, but the press was

10:16.157 --> 10:22.984
favorable towards the government. And being 
elected as government, they were aligned, if not

10:23.024 --> 10:29.531
politically, then idealistically with 
Allende's government. And when Allende was

10:30.512 --> 10:37.639
overthrown, it came out that there were CIA 
implications helping to overthrow him. a lot of

10:38.395 --> 10:48.723
people became, well, they always suspected, a lot 
of people suspected that maybe the Peace Corps

10:38.395 --> 10:48.723
volunteers were involved with the CIA. And 
because of the events in Chile, It just brought up

10:53.583 --> 11:03.472
to the surface a little more that perhaps the CIA 
may be getting involved in improving politics,

10:53.583 --> 11:03.472
and we could have been perhaps puppets. It was in a 
lot of conversations that came out. Yeah, yeah,

11:06.294 --> 11:22.088
but you're involved, and it took a lot of 
convincing, and I'm not sure we convinced

11:06.294 --> 11:22.088
everyone, but I think a lot of people... Once they 
gained that trust... Yeah, I think they realized

11:06.294 --> 11:22.088
and tried to quite the more radical elements that 
were in the field with us working that, you know,

11:23.283 --> 11:33.357
just a guy doing a job and let's not harass him too 
much. But there were always some that did actually

11:33.918 --> 11:37.924
believe that we worked. But I doubt, and I can't say 
for sure, but it's always been Peace Corps policy

11:38.164 --> 11:46.536
never to be involved in political activities. And 
being involved with the CIA would jeopardize

11:47.437 --> 11:52.885
Peace Corps operations throughout the world. How 
about just interested in the cocaine business

11:53.320 --> 11:56.804
there in Peru? Was it still a major export? No, no. 
When I was there, cocaine really hadn't gained as

12:02.690 --> 12:07.895
much popularity as it has now. The coca leaf, which 
is cultivated in the mountains,

12:09.517 --> 12:22.230
is utilized a lot by the laborers, a lot by the 
Indians in the mountains. A lot of people, a lot of

12:22.683 --> 12:33.757
the farmers I worked with, I'd go out to the fields 
and they'd have a mouthful, like we have here in

12:22.683 --> 12:33.757
Texas, they'd have a mouthful of tobacco or 
Copenhagen, they'd have a mouthful of coca

12:22.683 --> 12:33.757
leaves. And it didn't have the same effect as 
purified cocaine, but it was a narcotic and I guess

12:34.357 --> 12:48.775
it allowed them to work a little bit harder and not 
experience hunger and thirst. It was, but it

12:50.628 --> 12:51.789
wasn't. As a matter of fact, the trade in coca 
leaves was legal at the time. Okay. Upon your

12:58.615 --> 13:07.804
completion of your three-year tour, I guess, or 
whatever you could call it, did you feel that you,

12:58.615 --> 13:07.804
was it a success in your life? Did you, or I guess put 
it this way, what kind of impact did it play on your

13:07.824 --> 13:14.510
life? Did you feel like you had done something? 
Yeah, yeah, definitely. I... A lot of Peace Corps

13:18.961 --> 13:29.478
programs in different countries, especially 
when Peace Corps initially started, they'd send a

13:18.961 --> 13:29.478
volunteer out to the field in an unstructured job. 
They had a kind of a catch-all phrase for the work

13:30.159 --> 13:33.484
they did, which was community development. And it 
was up to the volunteer himself to either build a

13:33.905 --> 13:43.600
school or teach English or maybe get small 
community gardens started, vegetable gardens.

13:44.461 --> 13:46.825
Whereas my job was more structured, and we had a 
definite a job to do and a definite goal to obtain. I

13:50.280 --> 13:55.306
think by the time I left, and I've been back there 
since, I've seen the results of it. Most of the

13:55.327 --> 13:56.408
farmers have been. Most, if not all, the farmers in 
that area do grow the variety that I introduced

13:57.570 --> 14:01.275
when I was there. And that's a great satisfaction. 
I've seen the results. And not only that, before I

14:08.385 --> 14:14.533
went into Peace Corps, I was sort of undecided 
about what I wanted to do in the future. It kind of

14:15.020 --> 14:17.783
got me more interested in agriculture. As a 
result, I came back to Hanover and got my master's

14:17.803 --> 14:22.487
in ag. I kind of have a profession I want to pursue 
now. Well, going back to the start, back in the

14:27.132 --> 14:33.658
early 60s, Kennedy initiated the Peace Corps 
program. When did you first hear about the Peace

14:34.699 --> 14:36.300
Corps? I mean, when you very first heard about it 
was the Kennedy idealism period. Yeah, I'd heard

14:43.403 --> 14:47.869
about it since, you know, since junior high 
school, I was aware of it. And throughout college,

14:47.889 --> 15:01.286
you would hear more because there were recruiters 
on campus, and you were running into people who had

14:47.889 --> 15:01.286
been overseas, had been in the Peace Corps, and 
some of those had very favorable experiences. And

15:01.346 --> 15:04.470
I thought it, you know, it started getting me 
interested. And, yeah, at the time, people, a lot

15:04.510 --> 15:09.597
of the people... They were very idealistic, and 
they thought maybe they could do something to

15:10.640 --> 15:22.835
change the status in society, if not overseas. And 
I think that's one of the reasons Kennedy created

15:22.855 --> 15:26.319
it. He saw there was a

15:26.340 --> 15:36.312
desire among young people to do something besides 
worry about themselves. And he gave them an outlet

15:36.332 --> 15:38.014
to do that. He challenged them or something. I 
guess you could call it that. The purpose of the

15:44.377 --> 15:53.488
Peace Corps wasn't only to give young people an 
opportunity to do something a little extra, but we

15:44.377 --> 15:53.488
were sort of like goodwill ambassadors. I mean, 
you gave people in the Third World an opportunity

15:53.528 --> 15:57.252
to meet Americans. This common, ordinary 
American youth, you got the idea that you weren't

15:57.953 --> 16:05.402
the spies and the exploiters and the capitalists 
that the Third World had made us out to be,

16:06.850 --> 16:13.560
especially the radical types in the Third World. I 
think, for the most part, volunteers betray that,

16:14.701 --> 16:29.382
that we're willing to help and we're not simply out 
for a buck, because the pay we got It was just a

16:29.783 --> 16:31.405
subsistence allowance. You know, you got by. It 
took it easy. You could save a little, but that

16:34.791 --> 16:37.335
wasn't the purpose. It was just enough to allow you 
to live comfortably. That's about it. And I think a

16:42.863 --> 16:56.584
lot of people, at least from my experience, I don't 
have to say they were impressed with the Americans

16:42.863 --> 16:56.584
that they were dealing with. I think it was a 
favorable experience on both parts, mine and

16:56.834 --> 17:00.918
theirs. I got to be friends with an awful lot of 
crewmates in the area I was working, and I think the

17:00.958 --> 17:11.450
respect that was generated was mutual.

17:11.470 --> 17:22.842
Okay, Vic, upon your three years there, did you 
feel like you had accomplished what you set out to

17:11.470 --> 17:22.842
do, or did you feel like you maybe needed six months 
to a year to maybe accomplish what you set out to do?

17:24.644 --> 17:27.948
Well, basically, I feel I accomplished what I set 
out to do. But because I've been there three years

17:27.968 --> 17:42.163
and the experience gained over those three years, 
I think I could have done perhaps a little better as

17:27.968 --> 17:42.163
far as

17:27.968 --> 17:42.163
providing technical assistance to these 
farmers. But

17:42.223 --> 17:50.652
after being there three years, I had to apply for a 
fourth year extension. Soon after that

17:52.100 --> 17:59.029
application was made, we were notified by the 
Peruvian government that we'd have to leave the

17:52.100 --> 17:59.029
country. We were given 90 days. The Peace Corps 
program was given 90 days to leave the country. And

18:04.076 --> 18:06.739
it was, I believe it was a political decision. 
Maybe the events in Chile had something to do with

18:08.662 --> 18:11.325
it, maybe not. But in 1974, there was a lot of talk 
about especially in the press and political

18:16.889 --> 18:23.020
cartoons, about the Peace Corps being involved 
with the CIA. And the Proving Government seemed to

18:23.080 --> 18:27.849
be one over the country of all foreign influence. 
The Rotary Club, the Boy Scouts, and the Peace

18:28.210 --> 18:34.101
Corps was one of the biggest organizations that 
was first asked to lead. And it came as a shock to

18:35.022 --> 18:40.753
myself and to the program in general, most of the 
people involved. A lot of volunteers were in

18:41.189 --> 18:53.047
service a year or two, and seeing results of the 
work they were doing and having to leave it at

18:41.189 --> 18:53.047
midstream was disheartening, to say the least. 
And, well, there was nothing we could do. Requests

18:57.254 --> 19:01.480
were made, but all immediately turned down by the 
Peruvian government. So I left with a bit of

19:03.022 --> 19:09.913
disappointment in not being able to spend a fourth 
year there and perhaps doing a bit more in the field

19:10.383 --> 19:11.444
I was working. But that was just the way it turned 
out. OK, one last question for the people out

19:16.090 --> 19:18.873
there. The Peace Corps as a whole, you think it's a 
worthwhile program? Did you get a lot out of it? You

19:22.578 --> 19:26.262
think that it's just a good program? Yeah, I do, 
especially now because they're not recruiting

19:26.903 --> 19:33.972
the generalists they were when the Peace Corps 
initially started. They want people with a skill

19:33.992 --> 19:39.799
or a trait that they can teach. If not, they want 
people with a technical background, a good

19:40.893 --> 19:54.329
college education in agriculture or some 
engineering field, because a lot of the countries

19:40.893 --> 19:54.329
are requesting people with more technical 
skills. I'd recommend Peace Corps to anybody

19:55.370 --> 19:59.335
that's interested in working overseas. It was a 
great cross-cultural experience for me, and I

20:00.557 --> 20:03.860
think it would be for anyone. At the same time, It 
tests your abilities, your ability at innovation

20:06.138 --> 20:12.143
and resourcefulness and adapting. Because 
that's a big part of it. It's the ability to adapt to

20:14.265 --> 20:21.031
the global conditions and the people and the 
culture you're working in. And it's a necessity if

20:21.071 --> 20:26.055
you're going to be successful.

20:28.657 --> 20:32.060
Well, Vic, I appreciate you taking the time and 
letting me interview you. And I think this is going

20:32.761 --> 20:35.723
to be a worthwhile pay to let people listen to it, 
and learn a little bit about the Peace Corps and

20:35.905 --> 20:39.614
Peru itself. Appreciate it, dude. Thank you, Jim.
