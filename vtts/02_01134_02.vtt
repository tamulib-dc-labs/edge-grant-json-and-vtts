00:03.558 --> 00:10.948
And he said that, I've just made a deal with a 
brilliant theoretical physicist by the name of

00:03.558 --> 00:10.948
Dimitris Nanopoulos. And he comes from 
Wisconsin, a Greek. And he said, boy, he's really

00:16.916 --> 00:18.959
something. In fact, he was also one of the 12 
potential Nobel laureates. He had been cited so

00:23.405 --> 00:24.887
many times. There was a scientific American 
citing. He says that he's willing to come to A&M to

00:27.791 --> 00:31.776
be a theoretical physicist. His wife came down the 
other day. She looked around and she said, no way.

00:38.592 --> 00:39.853
What am I going to do? I said, I don't know. Send him 
his wife down here. Maybe I'll show him around.

00:44.318 --> 00:45.539
Maybe we'll figure out something. So I'll get 
Russ, she'll get Ruth. We encourage them by how you

00:47.220 --> 00:49.923
can work with our coroner. So she came down and 
said, OK, I'll live in the woodland. But I'm not

00:52.285 --> 00:54.467
going to say a conversation, period. I'm just 
telling you what went on. And therefore, they

00:56.309 --> 00:57.930
hired him. And he had been working with us, working 
with A&M. He goes up there. band goes up there twice

01:01.186 --> 01:05.031
a week and he teaches, you know, and does that. 
That's why it can work with College Station,

01:05.051 --> 01:13.964
because it's, you know, you get the cultural base 
of Houston, and yet you're kind of in between,

01:05.051 --> 01:13.964
about an hour and twenty minutes away or thirty 
minutes away. And I think that if we get the Aggie

01:13.984 --> 01:16.388
Express, it'd be closer. We're trying to work on 
that, too. But that's an example of how we can work

01:19.672 --> 01:23.438
with these universities. In geotechnology, I 
know enough about the jobs of the nation, what we

01:24.880 --> 01:28.645
have to do. that I think that there's certain 
things that we can do together that would probably

01:29.738 --> 01:34.844
find cash directly. And you still have to drill it 
well and be successful 90% of the time, or 50% of the

01:35.986 --> 01:41.533
time. One thing you said earlier was that the oil 
industry really has never engaged in the kind of

01:41.553 --> 01:48.362
research and development activities. No, but let 
me say this. We've got something else that's

01:49.383 --> 01:51.766
developing pretty quick, too. But anyway, I know 
that we can do that. But the thing is this, we don't

01:54.309 --> 01:57.433
have the top theoretical geophysicists of the 
world here in any of those four universities. That

02:02.960 --> 02:04.242
didn't make sense to me. But all the industries 
here, they would work with us to help make these

02:04.663 --> 02:09.570
people really, really get ahead. So in the tenure, 
we'd do something. Now, we just put together,

02:11.433 --> 02:26.155
after the National Problem Council 
recommendation about three years ago, and I've

02:11.433 --> 02:26.155
been working a year and a half doing it, I finally 
got 23 companies, major companies and major

02:11.433 --> 02:26.155
research companies, to agree to go together to do 
research with heart. And that focus, that DOE is

02:26.557 --> 02:30.161
supposed to match us in dollars. So now we're 
trying to put that, it's been a terrible effort to

02:30.181 --> 02:36.729
put it together, but I finally got to 23, I'm only at 
25, I think. Major companies, independents,

02:36.750 --> 02:55.112
Slumber J, service companies, and now for the 
first time, we think we might have some chance

02:36.750 --> 02:55.112
that, driven by the private sector, matching 
money between DOE and the private sector, to be run

02:36.750 --> 02:55.112
by HARC, but mainly work with the university and 
with everything. Now, that's the type of thing

02:55.649 --> 02:57.511
that Hart can do. See, this is what we're trying. 
This is the way we're trying to save Hart. Create

03:01.975 --> 03:03.536
those structures, those consortia. A structure, 
that consortia, that way the privacy. Because

03:05.899 --> 03:08.321
Houston is going to be the most dynamic town in the 
Southwest. I know that. Dallas is good, but

03:08.901 --> 03:10.803
Houston's going to be the best. Don't tell them 
that, but I said that. However, how do we make this

03:15.908 --> 03:20.392
thing not only for the benefit of Houston, Texas, 
but the nation? That's what I think Hart can do.

03:22.154 --> 03:23.715
That would be something. That is. That's an 
exciting world you've been living in and

03:24.628 --> 03:27.091
building. But I think that all these things have a 
great deal of promise, and Joe and all of them are

03:27.111 --> 03:33.959
interested in it, and I've got a lot of feedback 
from others. Well, I think everybody is. That's

03:35.020 --> 03:35.541
one thing. We found a great deal of unanimity in the 
enthusiasm and the dedication, I think. Well,

03:41.228 --> 03:43.210
anyway, I'm anxious to see what you all get put 
together. Well, thank you, sir. We really

03:43.771 --> 03:45.433
appreciate your time.
