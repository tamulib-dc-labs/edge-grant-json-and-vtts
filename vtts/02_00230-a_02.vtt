WEBVTT

00:04.452 --> 00:32.637
when I arrived in early October the corn well it was frozen they had an early frost that year so you couldn't get much data out of it and they had a few small plots of wheat that Dr. Harard planted and that was all frosted we didn't get any data so not much happened that first planting season of

00:33.629 --> 00:37.434
even of 44.

00:38.035 --> 00:41.519
But we did plant that falls, a few limited samples of wheat.

00:41.559 --> 00:54.837
Dr. Wellhausen and I went out onto a couple of farms and a couple of old, beat-up experiment stations that had been established and made some limited plantings of wheat, maybe in December.

00:55.678 --> 01:02.607
And Bill Caldwell and I, who was still there, the agronomist soils person, we put in a couple of fertilizer experiments out on farms.

01:03.312 --> 01:12.400
But we planted on the station in Chapingo where we were working, developing this experimental station.

01:12.981 --> 01:15.643
I ran the boundary surveys on it on the roads.

01:16.504 --> 01:30.417
I was an old forester and so I, this was part of my training and I ran the boundary surveys and the canals and location and all of these sorts of things in the early months.

01:30.532 --> 01:34.557
We made some plantings so that we could begin crossing our wheat plots.

01:35.638 --> 01:39.663
This was done in December of 44.

01:40.384 --> 01:44.709
And in the spring of 45, we began making the crosses and whatnot.

01:45.390 --> 01:48.073
And Wellhausen was getting ready to make his corn plantings.

01:48.754 --> 01:59.847
So the real effective first plantings were made in the fall of 44 in wheat and in corn.

02:00.974 --> 02:03.177
in the spring of 45.

02:03.757 --> 02:11.046
The 44 ones were killed by frost in both cases, so they really didn't accomplish much.

02:11.066 --> 02:19.655
And during the first year of 45, I worked on wheat, and then I helped Dr. Wellhausen in the disease problems on corn as well.

02:20.196 --> 02:30.728
And I started working on the bean and insect and disease problems both with some young people who were assigned to me.

02:32.952 --> 02:43.023
did some of the early spray and dust work on insects, on beans, a study of the diseases that seemed to be most important.

02:43.043 --> 02:43.623
We were growing.

02:43.924 --> 02:51.171
And Dr. Wellhausen sent out people to collect all the bean varieties he could lay hands on that were grown in different parts also.

02:52.092 --> 02:54.795
He handled both the corn and the beans.

02:55.636 --> 02:57.698
And Harar was directly in charge of the wheat.

02:57.818 --> 03:01.322
But by the spring of 45, one day he came and he said, look,

03:01.792 --> 03:03.434
He says, we're going to build this program.

03:04.175 --> 03:19.414
I've got a job on my hands here to find staff and the right ones and thousand details and trying to get the linkages with the Mexican government right, and he says, take it over and see what you can do with it.

03:19.434 --> 03:24.540
And so, that's- So, he had to do more of the administrative bureaucratic type jobs.

03:24.560 --> 03:24.801
Yes.

03:24.881 --> 03:26.803
And so, that allowed you to do more scientific

03:27.020 --> 03:44.984
In the pioneering part of it, it was a good job and Herrera was a tremendous organizer and I think in a large part the success of the Mexican program goes back to his vision and his insights into what was needed for the future.

03:45.044 --> 03:55.018
I'm sure he had good counseling from Stakeman Mangelsdorf from Bradfield in the early times, but he was an innovative person and he

03:55.606 --> 04:01.311
knew how to get the orders of priorities right, and he was a great handler of people.

04:02.613 --> 04:15.525
He had antennae that transmitted sensitivities, and yet he was firm when he needed to be, and that's the kind of personality he was.

04:16.466 --> 04:19.669
So, that's the way it all started.

04:21.831 --> 04:23.773
Of course, I soon became

04:24.327 --> 04:51.364
involved in the pretty largely in wheat we added a small program in barley and oats also but there's one thing that shows I think that's an interesting thing that first summer we had put in the spray and dust test on control of insects and diseases on beans we had this

04:51.563 --> 04:55.228
Big bean collection, I think we had about 1800 collections.

04:56.069 --> 05:11.871
Some of them were duplicates, but we had taken notes on them several times during the course of the season for leaf diseases, foliar diseases, for insect damage, and we were pulling them all up looking at the root rot.

05:11.891 --> 05:18.600
This was in October, maybe mid-October, at the main station there at Chipingo.

05:19.576 --> 05:21.658
There had been frost ten days or so before.

05:22.539 --> 05:28.626
The corn rustling dry, there was a pretty good wind breeze blowing.

05:28.646 --> 05:35.114
And there came one of those whirlwind dust devils across one corner of the unplanted thing.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.156
You could see the dust kicking out and whirling up.

05:37.537 --> 05:41.561
It came across the cornfield and tore the leaves off.

05:41.801 --> 05:48.469
And it did this when we had about half an hour's work left to finish this whole year's

05:48.955 --> 05:53.641
work on classifying all of these bean diseases, insects, and the root rot.

05:53.661 --> 06:03.093
And when we went over to eat our sandwich, we put the notebook, and it had all of the notes for the whole year on all of these experiments.

06:04.014 --> 06:13.926
We had snap-covered notebooks at that time, not the spiral, but snap-covered, and all of these loose sheets, a hundred and some pages.

06:15.829 --> 06:18.372
We put it at the head of the row on the last

06:19.263 --> 06:32.121
a row that we pulled out of the bean plants, and we put a little stool that we were working with on top of it, went over and sat under an ash tree over there to eat our sandwich and drink our thermos of coffee.

06:32.601 --> 06:47.582
And that whirlwind came through and went across the corn, and we sat there looking, and then it swung over in this direction, went right across this place where the beans were, and picked up that notebook and took it up in the air, how it took it that high, and then it jerked it open.

06:47.933 --> 06:50.195
And all of those sheets went up there.

06:50.435 --> 06:53.418
The last you saw most of them, they were the size of a cigarette paper.

06:55.100 --> 06:55.320
No kidding.

06:55.340 --> 06:56.882
And we looked everywhere.

06:58.864 --> 07:02.367
We put out, and that was a lot of money at that time.

07:03.388 --> 07:06.671
First we started with whatever it was, 50 centavos a sheet.

07:07.131 --> 07:10.975
I thought the students around the college would pick them up.

07:10.995 --> 07:16.000
Then it went up to a peso, which was, at that time,

07:16.267 --> 07:19.410
85 pesos to a dollar, and then we went to five pesos.

07:20.071 --> 07:22.494
All we recovered was about five sheets.

07:23.014 --> 07:24.396
The rest were gone with the wind.

07:25.397 --> 07:27.800
That was my first real experience there.

07:28.020 --> 07:30.222
That had an impact for the rest of the years.

07:30.403 --> 07:39.793
All the notebooks, not just in Mexico, but every one of the Rockefeller programs where it was spun off, all of those notebooks had a screw through them.

07:40.297 --> 07:43.240
with washers on it so that this wouldn't happen again.

07:43.420 --> 07:48.365
But it's a curious little insight into some of the disasters that can happen.

07:50.227 --> 07:55.913
In other words, what was lost was all the research information that you had taken for a year?

07:56.774 --> 07:57.335
On the beans.

07:57.955 --> 07:58.596
On the beans.

07:58.796 --> 08:00.858
And how did you ever replace that?

08:01.679 --> 08:02.980
Well, you just lost a year.

08:04.002 --> 08:05.443
We had reserved seed of these.

08:05.660 --> 08:06.982
So you could grow them out.

08:07.723 --> 08:13.973
And we remembered some of the best treatments, for example, of fungicides or insecticides.

08:14.013 --> 08:17.318
But the details, the exact note.

08:17.398 --> 08:23.427
We had enough notes that could have published the first paper on the use of DDT as an insecticide.

08:23.447 --> 08:25.730
It was very effective.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.935
I took a few little samples with me out of DuPont when I went there.

08:29.536 --> 08:31.119
And it was beautiful data.

08:31.139 --> 08:33.422
It all went up in that thing.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.894
The role of nature and history.

08:39.914 --> 08:40.414
Yes, sir.

08:40.955 --> 08:55.451
According to some of our environmentalists of today, everything is in balance with Mother Nature, but it seems to me she gets out of balance pretty often and she does some pretty curious things.

08:56.192 --> 09:05.282
It's interesting that the person who was doing this work, especially on this one insect, the

09:06.173 --> 09:10.980
weevil of beans, which was a very destructive pest, and it was practically unknown.

09:11.060 --> 09:17.449
Nobody had studied the biology, and he was doing that too, and he had some of those sheets in there, and then the spray really affected.

09:18.811 --> 09:24.098
He was going to use it for his thesis, for his enginirogronement, and it went up there.

09:24.539 --> 09:27.864
Poor guy, he cried like a little boy.

09:28.405 --> 09:28.965
I don't blame him.

09:29.526 --> 09:30.848
It set him back a whole year.

09:31.351 --> 09:35.715
As a matter of fact, he was one of the best young scientists we had.

09:35.835 --> 09:42.441
He eventually became the technical director of the new ENYA and one of the outstanding scientists.

09:42.741 --> 09:44.743
That's the way he got baptized.

09:44.763 --> 09:47.906
Of course, later I saw this happen.

09:48.326 --> 09:59.176
I had many things happen in subsequent years just to show what can happen in the beauties of research where everything is supposed to be orderly.

09:59.797 --> 10:01.138
On a weekend,

10:01.642 --> 10:12.712
Several years later, where we had backcross material, which means that you had worked several generations in backcrossing, and it was elite material, small plot, where we were making another backcross.

10:13.613 --> 10:19.419
Friday night, the late Dr. Joe Rupert and I were working this Saturday afternoon.

10:19.919 --> 10:20.520
We went home.

10:21.581 --> 10:31.530
We came back Monday morning, and there had been a whole herd of donkeys, burros in there, and they ate it right down to the ground.

10:31.747 --> 10:42.378
About 25 years and 20 years later over in India, when we had the seed multiplication over there, we had elephant trouble.

10:42.398 --> 10:44.360
They'd come around and walk right through the fences.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.364
Get in there and pick that stuff up and throw it in every direction.

10:48.944 --> 10:51.807
So it can range, and then birds of course everywhere.

10:52.848 --> 11:00.876
So it can be whirlwinds, it can be burrows, it can be elephants, or it can be birds.

11:02.122 --> 11:05.547
So it's not such a tranquil life as one would think sometimes.

11:05.927 --> 11:08.451
It's a different type of laboratory than most people talk about.

11:08.471 --> 11:08.871
That's right.

11:08.992 --> 11:10.874
There are lots of variables you can't control.

11:10.934 --> 11:15.861
Of course, hailstorms have been hailed out completely several times.

11:18.685 --> 11:22.470
I want to go back to the Foreign Technical Assistance Program.

11:23.031 --> 11:23.552
Okay.

11:23.572 --> 11:27.717
Now, how did this become more formalized in the United States government?

11:27.737 --> 11:28.579
Okay.

11:28.599 --> 11:29.580
This program

11:30.269 --> 11:55.163
The original Rockefeller Program was established in 1943, early, late January, early February, and it was organized as a special office, the Office of Special Studies, semi-autonomous within the Secretary of Agriculture.

11:56.324 --> 11:59.868
This gave us the autonomy to move without all of the bureaucracy.

11:59.928 --> 12:06.474
Had we been put directly under an old line agency, we'd have been tied to the bureaucracy.

12:06.875 --> 12:22.450
This gave us a great deal of autonomy, and the government's funds went into a fund that was controlled by this office, but in a joint, jointly, the Rockefeller funds went into it too.

12:23.273 --> 12:28.979
And because you had two different funding agencies, is that why you had more autonomy?

12:30.942 --> 12:35.086
Well, first of all, probably in a large part because of the Rockefeller contributions.

12:35.106 --> 12:40.072
But the Mexican government was surprisingly flexible.

12:40.512 --> 12:49.382
They established this fund, Fedocomiso, which is a joint thing where you have joint control of the account in the bank.

12:51.337 --> 12:54.480
And never once was there any criticism.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.023
Of course, it was handled very carefully.

12:57.824 --> 13:04.351
Never any questions asked about how the way those funds were administered from the beginning till the end.

13:05.212 --> 13:08.876
Now, this program was established in 43.

13:08.936 --> 13:15.222
The Marshall Plan came into being in 1949, so it preceded it by six years.

13:15.983 --> 13:20.668
The .4 program, which evolved eventually, .4 under

13:20.952 --> 13:23.835
President Harry Truman's address to the nation in 49.

13:23.915 --> 13:26.677
No, both of those are 48, weren't they?

13:26.697 --> 13:27.798
No, the funding.

13:28.358 --> 13:30.400
Oh, you're talking funding, okay.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.441
By the time the funding came out.

13:31.461 --> 13:35.064
By the time the funding came, the Marshall Plan came on stream in 49.

13:35.244 --> 13:36.546
Yeah, okay.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.448
And 0.4 came on stream in 1950.

13:39.608 --> 13:40.709
I think that's right.

13:40.769 --> 13:42.471
I have it in my notes here.

13:42.751 --> 13:43.712
That's the way I remember.

13:45.233 --> 13:49.677
So, it was six or seven years before.

13:50.180 --> 13:57.188
So this Office of Special Studies then was part of the Department of Agriculture in its own way.

13:57.208 --> 13:57.748
Ex officio.

13:57.968 --> 13:59.430
Oh, exactly.

13:59.450 --> 14:02.273
For about six years before it was officially taken over.

14:03.254 --> 14:06.297
No, it was this, the whole time.

14:06.638 --> 14:07.278
Okay.

14:07.298 --> 14:20.052
Until it finished its duty, the Officina de Studio Specialis was the label we operated under, until the job was done in 1960, 17 years.

14:20.690 --> 14:26.536
For example, all the vehicles we had carried the seal, the Ministry of Agriculture seal.

14:27.377 --> 14:30.680
From that standpoint, they were official, but we really weren't.

14:31.861 --> 14:33.843
But we never had any difficulties this way.

14:34.144 --> 14:45.415
I think this was largely because the way Harar structured it, and I'm sure that Stakeman was very influential because he spoke Spanish very well and always when he would visit,

14:46.120 --> 14:52.007
He was on a pretty personal basis as the secretaries, even the presidents.

14:53.929 --> 15:09.748
This is not to deny the importance of Mangelsdorf and Bradfield, but when you can communicate in their own language, it opens lots of, it transmits better, the feelings.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.258
Okay, where were we?

15:18.278 --> 15:38.990
We're talking about the late 1940s, early 1950s, and how the Office of Special Studies is dealing with, and the Mexican government, and how their type of administration, just basically what we're trying to find out is the chain of command, how things worked.

15:39.010 --> 15:39.971
Okay.

15:39.992 --> 15:42.215
We had a great deal of freedom in those times.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.378
We had very little physical equipment.

15:44.799 --> 15:44.899
Yeah.

15:45.267 --> 15:52.197
When we started that first summer, Harar found one little old tractor.

15:52.237 --> 15:55.142
It was miserable.

15:55.162 --> 15:59.869
It was a Montgomery War tractor that hadn't been sold, I guess, because it was that bad during the war.

16:00.289 --> 16:02.192
But he forgot it.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.734
And so Wellhausen had used this.

16:03.814 --> 16:04.395
It scratched.

16:04.475 --> 16:07.540
It didn't have any power, a miserable job of plowing.

16:07.560 --> 16:13.789
But that first summer before when I arrived, 43, he had planted with that.

16:14.275 --> 16:24.548
And then that fall of 44, we went out to a junkyard in the government bank, Wellhausen and I, we couldn't buy tractors.

16:26.291 --> 16:35.943
The old government bank, the Heidel Bank, and we found two old TD-9 international cat tractors.

16:35.963 --> 16:38.627
So we got permission to take both of them.

16:39.849 --> 16:43.253
We scavengerized one and made a tractor that would go

16:43.874 --> 16:49.260
for plowing and for heavy work, and we did the same thing for one other tractor.

16:49.280 --> 16:54.606
I think an old International Farmall.

16:54.626 --> 16:59.752
It was before the G. No, it was an International, not a John Deere.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.174
It was an International.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.215
I don't remember the model.

17:03.236 --> 17:04.438
Those were the first tractors.

17:05.119 --> 17:10.725
We only had first one vehicle for the three or four of us.

17:11.515 --> 17:19.508
So we had to have an order of how we were going to use it and what was most important and where we were going to travel, and we were restricted because of that.

17:19.528 --> 17:26.440
But eventually, in a couple of years, we began to get some pickups and some better equipment.

17:26.861 --> 17:30.887
Before we talk about the equipment and the problems, we're going to talk about the problems.

17:30.988 --> 17:33.051
The immediate equipment problems.

17:36.743 --> 17:37.685
all of those things.

17:38.085 --> 17:48.144
But we want to get back to that topic that we were on and that was the funding from the government, the American government, through the Marshall Plan, the Food for Peace.

17:49.206 --> 17:53.433
In other words, how the Foreign Technical Assistance Program was developed.

17:55.437 --> 17:58.262
I did hear the other day and I

17:58.512 --> 18:01.755
can't lay hands on it now, it's here and I'll get you a copy.

18:03.176 --> 18:18.610
Sort of a boiled down version of the expenditures of the Rockefeller Foundation, its own contribution to the program in Mexico from 43 to 61 when it was closed down.

18:20.512 --> 18:27.338
The total expenditures for operations for staff salaries for fellowships

18:27.773 --> 18:47.255
including for the establishment of the first graduate school for studies in agricultural science at Chapingo, the first in Latin America, added up to six in a fraction millions of dollars over those 17 years time.

18:51.039 --> 18:52.941
Six million dollars?

18:52.961 --> 18:55.043
Six in a fraction, less than seven.

18:55.063 --> 18:55.384
That's all?

18:55.984 --> 18:57.426
That's all.

18:58.132 --> 19:27.295
and to show the returns, that one crop increase over the base period last year in India, from 400 million bushels to a billion, 400 million bushels, fourfold increase, depending on how you calculate it, but it was worth somewhere between, in gross national product increase above the base period, was worth somewhere between five and six billion dollars.

19:27.494 --> 19:31.761
So, as you can see, that was in one crop, one year in one country.

19:32.562 --> 19:37.790
Mexico many times paid for itself just on the change there, but just to kind of bring it into focus.

19:39.192 --> 19:44.560
I think the budget, the first, and I have that on that sheet too.

19:44.941 --> 19:47.084
Remind me before you leave, we'll dig it up.

19:48.426 --> 19:55.257
I think the budget for the first three years for the whole operations and that was

19:56.806 --> 20:06.933
getting things going, was less than $200,000, something on that order.

20:07.254 --> 20:10.984
And that was from the Rockefeller Foundation, and how much, do you remember how much

20:11.386 --> 20:13.649
that the Mexican government put in?

20:13.669 --> 20:35.136
The Mexican government, I can't give you the breakdown, but most of theirs was payment of salaries in part, some for all of these young trainees, but most of it was written off in given land, in giving certain physical facilities to carry on the work, and you had to put some kind of a value on it so that you could see if it was in balance.

20:36.278 --> 20:40.583
So I can't put that on a peso or dollar basis.

20:41.170 --> 20:43.854
How about as far as construction was concerned?

20:43.894 --> 20:52.948
The first building we had was adobe with a tar paper roof made from nothing.

20:52.968 --> 20:55.732
We made our own fence post out of cement the same way.

20:58.376 --> 21:09.473
Wood is expensive and it wasn't until 1949 that we built the first building at this Experiment Station headquarters in

21:10.077 --> 21:20.870
on the ground at Chipingo, that is, the land belonged to the National College of Agriculture, but it hadn't been used for experimental work, and actually it hadn't been used in production.

21:20.890 --> 21:23.633
It was kind of abandoned, a good share of it.

21:23.653 --> 21:28.018
That was the state of the art at the School of Agriculture, too, at the time.

21:28.839 --> 21:37.890
And, of course, the first, in 1945 especially, then we started putting

21:38.343 --> 21:40.887
experiments both in corn and wheat out on farms.

21:43.431 --> 21:51.042
We didn't have the right places to develop agricultural experiment stations.

21:51.062 --> 21:53.265
We didn't know what we needed to measure.

21:54.247 --> 22:01.137
There were a few old abandoned or nearly abandoned experiment stations scattered around and poorly equipped.

22:01.157 --> 22:07.607
We put a few tests on those, but a lot of them we went into the areas that looked like they were important

22:07.874 --> 22:20.934
agriculturally, production-wise speaking, and we would get land from farmers to put in the test on corn breeding plots, or wheat, fertilizer tests, and so on.

22:20.954 --> 22:23.038
That's the way we operated in 1543.

22:23.899 --> 22:28.947
Often in the early days, you would use other people's land, their private land.

22:29.447 --> 22:36.278
Most of it was done on the farmers' fields, their land, given to us.

22:36.595 --> 22:38.472
Oh, so they deeded the land deal.

22:38.671 --> 23:08.205
just for use oh they just said come on on our ranch and plant some yeah okay and you see this is what many of the people in the new institutes today they write bulletins about on-farm testing hell we did that from the second year we were in operation and lots of them but it's a rediscovery of the wheel really and i should say that when i was given the job for looking at the wheat production i traveled the countryside with my poor spanish

23:08.185 --> 23:14.598
looking at where we could produce enough wheat to feed Mexico, and their production was very small at the time when I started there.

23:14.638 --> 23:22.573
It was only three hundred and forty-five thousand tons, which is a few million bushels.

23:24.176 --> 23:29.046
Be a third of thirty-seven, ten million, eleven million bushels, nothing.

23:29.566 --> 23:34.591
They were importing, and with population growing like it was, it had to look elsewhere.

23:35.432 --> 23:40.297
And among the places I visited was Ciudad Obregón, Sonora, Mexico, the Yaqui Valley.

23:41.238 --> 23:59.016
This is where I found, I don't know if we mentioned this when we talked about Rodolfo Caiz, son of the president, the governor of the state of Sonora, who had set up this beautiful experiment station, it must have been, when he became governor in 1934.

23:59.603 --> 24:01.265
And I found it in ruins.

24:03.809 --> 24:06.513
Then would this be the place to interject this?

24:07.494 --> 24:15.926
So I saw this beautiful valley on the west coast of Mexico, the Yaqui Valley, the Valley of the Yaqui River.

24:17.268 --> 24:24.458
It then had one dam on the river, Langostura, up towards Douglas, Arizona.

24:24.999 --> 24:26.481
Okay, and when did you see this?

24:27.342 --> 24:29.425
I went up there the first time in

24:29.725 --> 24:31.528
The spring of 45.

24:31.548 --> 24:31.968
Okay.

24:32.389 --> 24:36.575
And I have worked there every year since.

24:37.156 --> 24:56.205
I went because I had been reading that this, looking at the old data, probably not very reliable, but that this had been growing a lot of wheat after the canal was brought in.

24:57.316 --> 24:59.019
which came into operation in 1939.

24:59.339 --> 25:09.576
And I knew that there'd been some disastrous stem rust epidemics there in 39, 40, and 41, which I found out about when I got up there.

25:09.596 --> 25:12.721
There was then not much enthusiasm for wheat.

25:12.741 --> 25:22.817
The area was very limited, and during those war years they had shifted over to flax because they had lost most of their crop three years in a row on rust, stem rust.

25:23.827 --> 25:33.059
And so they were in flax and in summer with the wild waters in the river because there was a lot of volume that came down that couldn't be handled by that one dam or that came into the river below.

25:33.840 --> 25:40.029
And they had big borders two or three meters deep where when the wild water would come they would flood.

25:40.610 --> 25:48.881
And then when the water went down, this was in the higher parts of the valleys that were not really irrigated, not controlled irrigation.

25:48.901 --> 25:52.045
When the water went down in September or October they'd plant wheat.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.222
They didn't give it any irrigation.

25:54.242 --> 25:57.685
But in part of that land, when the wild water came, they plant rice.

25:59.768 --> 26:13.182
So I was impressed, and I figured that, and I had gone to, taken the trouble to find out what the plans were for irrigation in the next 20 years, where the government was planning to put dams.

26:13.202 --> 26:19.028
And I could see that there, in Sonora, in the next state south, Sinaloa,

26:19.160 --> 26:21.203
There was good water resources.

26:22.065 --> 26:23.767
The land was favorable for a week.

26:24.488 --> 26:26.812
There were serious disease problems.

26:26.832 --> 26:30.017
The farmers were receptive, except for the disasters.

26:30.678 --> 26:33.522
I went to see this station, and it was a shambles.

26:34.484 --> 26:46.703
But, subsequently, I found out how it was built from the family who would become completely disillusioned with the agricultural scientists because of what had happened.

26:48.607 --> 26:56.560
This had been established when Don Rodolfo Elias Callis became governor in 1934.

26:56.700 --> 27:08.218
He was the son of General Plutarco Elias Callis, who had been one of the revolutionary generals.

27:08.939 --> 27:13.787
He and Obergon, both of them became presidents of Mexico and they came from that area.

27:14.189 --> 27:24.207
They commanded in the revolution Yaqui, Indian troops, and they were tough, and played a pretty important role in the revolution.

27:26.431 --> 27:32.282
Subsequently, Obregón became president first, and Cayis, Plutarco, the father of the

27:32.870 --> 27:45.107
person I'm speaking about became the second president after the revolution and actually also the founder of PRI, Partido Revolucionario Instituciones.

27:45.167 --> 27:48.352
He was in 1928 he established PRI.

27:49.373 --> 27:59.628
But his son was a farmer also and a highly intelligent person and he used to like to visit Arizona and California and look at their agriculture.

27:59.648 --> 28:01.290
I'm sure this is what gave him

28:02.418 --> 28:07.627
The idea that we had to have an experimental station because this was long before I was there.

28:07.748 --> 28:08.008
Sure.

28:08.289 --> 28:14.340
But he used to visit the stations in California, Arizona.

28:15.442 --> 28:24.578
And so he had bought a hundred hectares of land, irrigated, completely irrigated, a good set of buildings.

28:25.199 --> 28:38.378
for the headquarters buildings and barns and stables, beautiful, that were shambles when I saw them, but you could tell from the architecture and the layout that there was some good planning.

28:39.941 --> 28:55.003
He had stocked it with blooded shorthorns and Holsteins and with two races of hogs, several kinds of poultry, beautiful

28:56.502 --> 29:14.103
orchard with a whole series of species, different kinds of fruits, small but halfway decent staff houses for the scientists and for the workers.

29:14.124 --> 29:21.092
But he only had one scientist who was there the first two years and he

29:21.342 --> 29:25.628
planted a few wheats, and from this he picked out one that did very well compared to the rest.

29:25.728 --> 29:37.104
It was the variety Mentana that was bred in Italy back in the late 20s, I believe it was, by Strompele, who was a famous wheat breeder in Italy at that time.

29:38.125 --> 29:46.797
And this variety did very well, and so he released it and distributed it, but he never had a dynamic breeding program backing it up.

29:46.817 --> 29:51.163
Then he was called to Mexico to organize what was called the Office of

29:51.953 --> 30:01.523
experimental stations, which was a very small, modest thing, very modest budget, and they didn't have any competence at all to put in charge of it.

30:02.043 --> 30:14.336
Came along the rust epidemic about two years later, 39, worse than 40 and 41, and they had no wheat to replace it with, and then that's the environment.

30:14.356 --> 30:19.041
The rust just devastated the wheat in this Obergon area?

30:19.882 --> 30:24.649
All the bread wheat, there was some mixtures of... So much Italian strain.

30:25.370 --> 30:30.638
Yeah, because there was nothing wrong with what he did, but he didn't have a program to back it up.

30:30.738 --> 30:37.688
If he had, and he would have seen that this was changing, he would have gotten one of those out probably after the first year.

30:38.005 --> 30:48.655
and they avoided it but that wasn't in the mix at that time and so when I arrived wheat was looked on as a miserable crop and worse yet.

30:48.675 --> 30:50.657
By the farmers in the area they were scared of it.

30:50.677 --> 31:06.713
The good ones especially, the good farmers and especially because he was one of the good farmers and three or four of his buddies were also the best and what was worse to be an agricultural scientist was

31:07.857 --> 31:31.688
miserable they would hardly to me they would they would treat me decently because I was a foreigner and I couldn't speak their language except words here and there but and they were less brutal than the farmers in central Mexico where they had had troubles too I heard them insult some of the young

31:32.967 --> 31:42.521
colleagues that was working with me that were fresh out of school saying, look, you agricultural scientists are social parasites.

31:43.963 --> 31:48.750
You feed from the taxes which we pay and you give us nothing in return.

31:49.571 --> 31:50.492
Bunch of bureaucrats.

31:51.033 --> 31:52.475
This was the general attitude.

31:52.956 --> 31:55.419
Now in Sonora they are more sophisticated in that way.

31:55.520 --> 32:01.388
I never heard that, but the sort of standoffishness told you

32:02.279 --> 32:04.562
All you needed to know that you weren't trusted.

32:05.443 --> 32:05.544
Yeah.

32:05.564 --> 32:06.845
And it was a long road back.

32:07.386 --> 32:13.094
The only way we gained it was by developing these varieties in a hurry.

32:13.214 --> 32:17.380
Before, I haven't talked to you about the shuttle breeding either, have I?

32:17.700 --> 32:20.044
No, we haven't got to that, but I want to stay here at Obergon.

32:20.064 --> 32:20.204
Okay.

32:20.224 --> 32:22.127
I want to hear this.

32:22.207 --> 32:30.278
This station was about, the old station was about,

32:31.338 --> 32:38.188
30 kilometers, about 18, 20 miles out on a dirt road, which at harvest time was that deep in dust.

32:38.849 --> 32:42.795
In summer, when it rained or when the river would overflow, it was mud that deep.

32:43.597 --> 32:46.601
There were no rural schools in the area at the time.

32:47.222 --> 32:53.872
The water was full of salt, and the one well that was there was, well, I guess you could drink it, but it was miserable.

32:55.475 --> 32:56.316
What elevation?

32:57.224 --> 32:59.127
That's about 39 meters.

32:59.187 --> 33:03.393
It's about 100 feet, 120 feet above sea level.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.356
That's on a flat coastal plain.

33:06.317 --> 33:06.918
Do you have a mountain?

33:06.938 --> 33:07.839
Beautiful land.

33:07.859 --> 33:09.301
Do you have a mountain?

33:09.321 --> 33:10.363
I'll try to dig one out.

33:11.304 --> 33:13.147
Okay, yeah, let's describe where it is.

33:13.167 --> 33:15.750
Hermesillo is the capital of the state of Sonora.

33:15.770 --> 33:24.683
It's about 140 miles south of Nogales, Arizona.

33:25.895 --> 33:28.660
But it's not in the valley, it's in a small valley.

33:29.502 --> 33:38.899
Then you move on south to the port of Guaymas, which has been and still is quite a popular tourist resort.

33:38.919 --> 33:41.464
And about how far is it from that port?

33:41.484 --> 33:48.898
From that port, it's about 60 miles south on the coastal plain, on the Pan American Highway now.

33:49.199 --> 33:59.652
about sixty miles south of Goimas, it's about 120 miles, 130 miles south of Hermosillo, big flat valley.

34:00.793 --> 34:16.472
At the present time, in that early time, it had about, with one dam in operation that went into operation in 1939, I think it was irrigating only about

34:17.296 --> 34:19.519
150,000 hectares of land.

34:20.521 --> 34:36.022
A second dam was built and if I think that in years when there's a good runoff and when there's stored up to capacity, it can irrigate about 400,000 hectares.

34:37.965 --> 34:39.247
Most years it doesn't do that.

34:39.727 --> 34:45.936
What's been worse in recent years in the land reforms, the political officers

34:46.608 --> 34:55.927
against the advice of the hydraulics engineers and the agronomists, there's more land, good land, than there is water for that land.

34:55.947 --> 35:00.577
And what the politician always does is to say, all right, we'll open more land.

35:00.817 --> 35:06.709
So you divert more of the water there and you get less water for the rest and it produces less food in the long run.

35:07.178 --> 35:09.882
So it's a salve for social problems.

35:09.902 --> 35:10.342
Yeah.

35:10.362 --> 35:11.444
Population pressures.

35:12.205 --> 35:12.305
Yeah.

35:12.325 --> 35:14.508
And I've been through that one several times.

35:15.889 --> 35:20.415
But tell me about, tell me about when you got there now, what did you do?

35:20.435 --> 35:24.981
Did you just go around and start talking to the major ranchers in the area?

35:25.282 --> 35:29.187
Or did you realize that that's where you wanted to set up a station or rebuild or?

35:29.207 --> 35:29.287
Yes.

35:29.848 --> 35:31.630
As soon as I saw this area.

35:32.391 --> 35:33.212
Okay, 1945, yeah.

35:33.272 --> 35:33.873
45.

35:34.574 --> 35:37.017
I made contact with the man who had then

35:37.368 --> 35:40.732
been sent there in charge of that old rundown station.

35:41.312 --> 35:43.755
Not the one was there when the disaster struck.

35:44.135 --> 35:51.183
He had been displaced, and I'm not sure it wasn't necessarily his responsibility or his fault.

35:52.164 --> 35:56.909
But this other man was enthusiastic, ill-prepared.

35:59.411 --> 36:06.919
He had an old beat-up pickup that would stand to break down more time than not, but we drove around the valley and I collected

36:07.591 --> 36:10.854
spikes from all the different kinds of wheats that I could see.

36:10.934 --> 36:16.779
I looked at the disease problems and looked at the other crops and tried to get as much of a field as possible.

36:16.859 --> 36:23.906
It was in probably early April, which is when it's approaching harvest.

36:26.007 --> 36:35.556
I took these back to Mexico where we had been working for and where we were to begin the big

36:35.823 --> 36:40.649
bush on the wheat breeding at Chipingo at the station headquarters.

36:40.669 --> 36:55.949
I should say that also that fall I have planted in farmers fields the fall before several places including in the so-called Bajillo area which is the old central part of colonial Mexico at about 5,600 feet elevation.

36:56.329 --> 36:58.332
It's primarily corn country.

36:58.592 --> 37:05.661
Now in recent years because of the way the cities have grown a lot of it's been converted into vegetables and

37:05.945 --> 37:18.445
alfalfa for milk production and so on, but at that time it was primarily grains, corn, wheat in winter, corn in summer, wheat, beans and so on.

37:18.806 --> 37:32.408
And so I was working there and so I took these samples back and with me and we had from the fall plantings of that year we had

37:33.147 --> 37:37.934
also made some of the earliest crosses in March of 45.

37:38.955 --> 37:46.586
And I added each of those heads in plots that summer to see what they were like in rust reaction.

37:46.626 --> 37:48.589
I kept part of the seed, fortunately.

37:49.010 --> 37:52.775
Most of them died from the rust in the summer when it rains every day.

37:55.379 --> 37:58.763
But I tried to pick out some that I thought would be useful parents.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.247
The next year I collected

38:02.172 --> 38:06.437
thousands of heads of all through central Mexico on the farms.

38:06.918 --> 38:10.543
Some of these were very old types that probably went back to colonial times.

38:11.824 --> 38:16.410
We didn't have any facilities for keeping the dam weevils would eat us up and all sorts of things.

38:16.510 --> 38:25.541
We picked out several of the best ones, and I had at that time, I guess it was in 40, I said 46, didn't I?

38:25.562 --> 38:30.728
This must have been, yes, when we made the collection, and in 40,

38:32.041 --> 38:34.785
Seven, I asked Dr. B.B.

38:34.845 --> 38:35.927
Bales of the U.S.

38:35.947 --> 38:50.028
Department of Agriculture to come down and spend a month with me to look at these classification of these, all these old weeds that I had growing in short rows derived from the heads that I picked.

38:50.929 --> 38:56.317
And so he spent a month and he was very good and an experienced, not only breeder, but a good agronomist.

38:56.337 --> 39:00.023
He knew practical things.

39:01.808 --> 39:07.734
So, and by this time, I was afraid of this rust, you see.

39:07.954 --> 39:08.455
Sure.

39:08.475 --> 39:13.880
I knew that, hell, that I wasn't going to have 11 years, which was the standard one you made one generation a year.

39:14.761 --> 39:19.346
Before, I had a disaster like had happened three years, 39, 40, and 41.

39:19.366 --> 39:19.706
Yeah.

39:20.246 --> 39:30.837
So one of the first decisions when I saw this Sonora area, I knew we had to make a strong pitch there because it had the potential to produce a lot of wheat.

39:31.829 --> 39:59.558
and I had been already working in the high valleys near Mexico City, and I had tests going in the Bay Hill so-called area, 5,600 feet, and I'd drawn some out in Tehuacán in Puebla, which is a dry area, and so I decided I had to find a way to get two generations a year and try to produce a variety in four and a half years, five years at the most.

39:59.578 --> 40:01.380
So I hit on the idea,

40:02.052 --> 40:11.035
have another epidemic and get thrown the hell out of the country as a fracasal, like we say in Spanish, or someone who's a failure.

40:11.055 --> 40:14.303
And of course the textbooks said you shouldn't do this at that time.

40:14.343 --> 40:17.732
The dogma was that whether in corn or in wheat,

40:17.982 --> 40:39.227
you had to cross, especially you had to make the selections from segregating populations and grow them in the area where you were going to sow them commercially, so that you got the right fit of the so-called genotype, the genetic entity that you selected out, and the soil and the climate environment.

40:40.349 --> 40:44.153
That was the way it had to be when I was a graduate student.

40:44.173 --> 40:45.795
That's what all the books said.

40:45.910 --> 40:49.013
Doesn't that sound like it makes sense?

40:49.634 --> 40:49.874
Yes.

40:51.455 --> 40:58.762
But what you were doing was raising wheat in, what, four different areas in Mexico with four different climates and four different soils.

40:59.303 --> 41:00.204
Is that right?

41:00.604 --> 41:01.825
Eventually went up to seven.

41:02.125 --> 41:02.686
Okay, seven.

41:02.706 --> 41:14.297
But the two key ones that I tried to exploit earliest was from Sonora, Cidad Obregón, where we planted when the farmer would plant mid-up,

41:14.513 --> 41:23.527
The first half of November then, now we plant the last days of November or the first week in December because the varieties are earlier maturing.

41:24.509 --> 41:29.938
But at that time we would plant no later than the middle of November, sometimes the first week.

41:31.260 --> 41:35.346
At 28 degrees latitude is where Cidad de Obregun is located.

41:36.769 --> 41:39.593
And it's at 120 feet above sea level.

41:40.315 --> 41:45.990
And when we planted in November, which is when the farmers would plant, the days were getting shorter.

41:47.113 --> 41:49.600
We would harvest in April.

41:50.525 --> 42:07.082
and picking from those segregating populations, which were the result of crosses, handmade crosses, made the best plants, both from the standpoint of disease resistance, that had the best straw, which was inadequate at that time, they grew too tall, but nevertheless the best that was available.

42:07.683 --> 42:17.173
The earliest possible types to try to escape rust, but also to conserve irrigation water, to be used on other crops.

42:17.812 --> 42:22.940
good grain characteristics that would be accepted by the milling and baking industry.

42:23.340 --> 42:24.722
We didn't have any laboratories.

42:24.742 --> 42:27.887
We'd have to send them out the first few years to have them tested.

42:28.007 --> 42:34.797
USDA helped us, and also General Mills in Minneapolis, small samples, a few of them.

42:35.739 --> 42:38.823
So you got General Mills and USDA, huh?

42:39.204 --> 42:43.330
Before we got our laboratory set up.

42:44.812 --> 42:49.238
So contemporary wisdom was you plant in one place, the geotype.

42:49.258 --> 42:50.299
Sure, right.

42:50.680 --> 42:52.322
Genotype, we call it.

42:52.342 --> 42:54.025
G-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E.

42:54.085 --> 42:59.131
That's the fixed entity with genetic characteristic.

42:59.772 --> 43:04.439
So I'd harvest in August, or in April, last days of April.

43:05.460 --> 43:11.008
And I knew that I had to plant early in May or I'd get frosted before the seed would mature in the high valleys.

43:11.628 --> 43:12.810
So I'd take that seed.

43:14.140 --> 43:15.061
and plant part of it.

43:17.104 --> 43:22.790
Every seed that came from one plant in a short row in Chopingo and a few years later at Toluca.

43:22.810 --> 43:25.774
First at Chopingo it's about 7,500 feet elevation.

43:26.194 --> 43:34.965
Then we moved to 8,500 feet a few years later in Toluca because we got more rain there and we could get better disease selection.

43:36.326 --> 43:42.814
So we'd plant there and no later than the 10th of May when the days were getting longer.

43:43.587 --> 43:49.578
And there we were planting at 18 degrees latitude, which meant that we had moved it 700 miles south.

43:50.259 --> 43:54.466
The day lengths were getting longer in one case and shorter in the other.

43:54.486 --> 43:59.295
And we would select the best plants each cycle in those different locations.

44:00.257 --> 44:05.967
Best for disease resistance— Longer in May and shorter in November is what you're talking about.

44:06.436 --> 44:12.884
And so we would select the best adapted plants that seemed to grow vigorously, big heads.

44:13.685 --> 44:15.006
The grain was plump.

44:15.026 --> 44:17.830
They had disease resistance, the best combination we could get.

44:18.410 --> 44:20.993
They were not immune, but better than the rest.

44:21.374 --> 44:25.939
But we were particularly interested in stem rust, one that destroyed.

44:26.019 --> 44:28.382
There were other diseases that you couldn't select for.

44:28.843 --> 44:31.225
You have to have an order of priorities on disease.

44:31.285 --> 44:35.110
You can't work on all of them at once or you get nothing done.

44:35.663 --> 44:39.987
And so we moved them back and forth, alternate generations.

44:40.007 --> 44:41.528
We got two generations a year.

44:41.568 --> 44:47.874
The result was that we had beautiful varieties compared to the old in three and a half years.

44:47.894 --> 44:50.536
And at the same time... Instead of the normal level?

44:51.077 --> 44:52.338
Level.

44:52.358 --> 44:57.222
But it took us another year and a half to get them in fairly good multiplication.

44:57.783 --> 44:57.883
Okay.

44:57.903 --> 45:03.628
At the same time that we tested them the second time and the third time,

45:04.047 --> 45:08.695
we were already multiplying ones that we thought were the best, and they turned out to be.

45:09.476 --> 45:26.804
And that second year also, in 48, Bales came back again to look at the classification of these things, and I took him with me to Sonora, and he traveled in the different parts, and I showed him these, and he said, run with them.

45:26.824 --> 45:29.329
So, we'd already started to multiply them.

45:29.349 --> 45:30.831
So, they went out on farms,

45:32.532 --> 45:43.164
in small plots, or in three farms, including the ex-governor, Rodolfo Caius, and two of his best friends, because I know one of his best friends.

45:43.684 --> 45:55.477
And then two other farmers, one the next door neighbor, who was kind enough to loan us machinery to plow the plots, because the machinery was non-functional.

45:55.497 --> 45:58.641
And he said, oh, they're going, they just couldn't do anything.

45:59.482 --> 46:02.505
And so he would plow it for us,

46:02.755 --> 46:03.671
He would help us.
