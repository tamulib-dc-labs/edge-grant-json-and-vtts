00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.287
How many tests did you give per semester in that course?

00:00:05.307 --> 00:00:08.455
In statistics I gave four tests and a final exam.

00:00:09.378 --> 00:00:11.904
By the way, I always gave final exam in all courses.

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:16.275
Be it graduate or undergraduate.

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:18.681
Right.

00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:26.962
In history, we talk about whether or not it was a discussion question or an objective.

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:30.726
What kinds of test questions would be in that?

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.273
Well, I used, not in that statistics course.

00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:40.958
In the statistics course, I used calculations a lot.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.162
But of course, I was interested in concepts.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.364
But in order for them to do the calculation, they had to have the concept too.

00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:50.265
So I had that figured out.

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:59.094
But in most of my courses other than that, I did rely a lot on multiple choice questions and similar type objective questions.

00:00:59.194 --> 00:01:02.117
I relied probably more than the average on those.

00:01:02.817 --> 00:01:13.187
And also I might mention Haskell, that from the very first day I started here, I felt under a, see my,

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:16.730
My special field was test construction.

00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:19.917
I was considered an expert in test construction.

00:01:20.558 --> 00:01:24.928
Well, that kind of, you're laying it on the line in your teaching, you know.

00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:28.677
I knew how to make tests.

00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:33.808
I didn't always make tests the best that I knew how to make them, but I knew my students would be

00:01:35.138 --> 00:01:41.866
critical of my, you know, here's this guy, he's a test expert, now look at this test question he gave me.

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:48.894
So I felt quite a bit of pressure to, in my test making activities.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:56.843
And I always considered the construction of tests for a course to be a large high percentage of my preparation for the course.

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.381
I would spend a very high amount of the total amount of time in preparation in preparing the test.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:07.549
And I didn't use old tests, at least not very much.

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.039
I would modify them or make them new.

00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:18.510
I did reuse certain questions, of course.

00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:26.179
made it a point, while I took very seriously my testing, I considered that one of the most important parts of teaching.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.422
Now, I had a guideline.

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:34.866
I'd always try to return the graded test within a week after I'd given it.

00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:36.047
Did you have any?

00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:37.909
Well, I was a little better than you, Haskell.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.771
I tried the next meeting.

00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:42.313
Wow.

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:42.593
That is good.

00:02:42.613 --> 00:02:46.016
But you can only do that with the objective test that I was using.

00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:47.738
That was one reason I did use them.

00:02:48.072 --> 00:02:56.144
If I had been giving essay tests, and of course occasionally I did, probably would have had a lot harder time doing that.

00:02:56.184 --> 00:02:57.106
But I agree with you.

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:59.950
I think it is very important to give quick feedback on the test.

00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:06.099
And I believe then and I believe now that testing is a very important part of the educational process.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:13.330
I think the students learn from taking the test, from preparing for the test, and from reviewing the test when they get it back.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.772
And I think, you know,

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:25.728
you're losing a large percent of the educational process if you leave out or don't give much attention to or much effort to the testing.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:35.522
What about some anecdotes about student goofiness or humor or jokes or anything?

00:03:36.924 --> 00:03:42.852
Well, I once taught a student that was a

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.608
graduate, she was graduating, I think she was a master's student, and she was enrolled in the statistics course.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.390
And I said, well, why didn't you take this earlier?

00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:54.354
You could have used it in a tool in a lot of your other courses.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:58.258
It could have helped you done your term papers or your experiments or your survey.

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.281
Why didn't you take it sooner?

00:04:01.062 --> 00:04:05.127
And she said, well, Dr. Barker, I thought I might die first by putting it off.

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:19.991
Did anybody try to give you any goofy excuse as to why they weren't able to get something done on time or why they were absent from the test?

00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:22.137
Well, you know that old one about a

00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:23.446
a dog getting it.

00:04:23.887 --> 00:04:27.593
I actually did receive that, getting an assignment.

00:04:28.013 --> 00:04:29.916
The dog chewed it up.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:30.377
Oh, really?

00:04:30.477 --> 00:04:34.684
I've heard that given as a joke, but I actually did receive that.

00:04:34.704 --> 00:04:38.770
A student came in and told you that?

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.875
And I said, well, I'll give you another week to do it.

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:45.340
Give you and your dog another week.

00:04:45.742 --> 00:04:48.407
Did any grandparent die?

00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:50.592
Repeatedly.

00:04:53.618 --> 00:04:57.225
No, I can't claim to have had those stories very much.

00:04:57.987 --> 00:05:03.919
And no girl ever came in to flirt, to try to get special or anything?

00:05:04.996 --> 00:05:07.259
I would say that wasn't a problem.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.490
I wouldn't say that it, I never had that, I never, you know, I never let it get that far.

00:05:16.193 --> 00:05:24.265
So I have had them come up real close, you know, closer than necessary to, you know, real close to talk.

00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:26.648
And I said, well, get back a little bit.

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:27.630
I can hear you okay.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.873
I know I'm old, but I can still hear it.

00:05:32.047 --> 00:05:32.848
Back on tape.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.275
Did you, what about sleeping in class or smoking in class?

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:42.160
Did you have any guidelines for classroom decorum?

00:05:43.262 --> 00:05:53.415
You know, I never said much about classroom decorum, but I believe they understood, you know, that I wanted them to have good decorum.

00:05:54.297 --> 00:05:55.558
Nobody ever smoked.

00:05:58.442 --> 00:06:01.446
Some did go to sleep.

00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:11.723
I don't believe this was a very kind thing to do, but I used to, well, in my larger classes where I have maybe about 100, I would

00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:13.928
they would have seat numbers.

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:20.437
And I would sometimes, just kind of as a joke, I would call them by 4-6, you know, or 3-2, third row, second.

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:23.021
They got a kind of a kick out of that.

00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:26.045
You know, I would just, instead of calling by name, I'd call them by their seat number.

00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:34.236
But sometimes, a few times, I have said, 3-4, would you please tap 3-3?

00:06:34.276 --> 00:06:39.583
That was a little bit cruel.

00:06:39.563 --> 00:06:42.689
That student apologized for going to sleep.

00:06:44.032 --> 00:06:47.879
I really did not intend to embarrass any student.

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:49.983
That was really a strong part of my philosophy.

00:06:50.003 --> 00:06:53.810
But once in a while, I made that mistake.

00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:59.361
If they went to sleep, I would kind of

00:06:59.493 --> 00:07:04.860
Maybe I would say something a little louder or be a little livelier or look in their direction.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.963
Well, of course, sometimes their eyes were shut.

00:07:07.063 --> 00:07:10.187
But I would look in the direction and be loud.

00:07:10.307 --> 00:07:11.709
And usually that would wake them up.

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:17.276
But I tried to get them awake but not to call attention to it.

00:07:17.296 --> 00:07:18.097
And that usually worked.

00:07:18.157 --> 00:07:21.842
I got some real tired people at those 5 o'clock classes, too.

00:07:21.902 --> 00:07:23.644
Some of them had been working all day.

00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:30.435
Now, what was different about teaching a three-hour night course and teaching day courses?

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:36.047
Well, that's something, yeah.

00:07:36.348 --> 00:07:37.990
Looking back, I don't see how I did it.

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:46.902
But I gave them about a 10 to 15 minute, usually about a 10 minute recess sometime in there.

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:48.704
They do have to go to the bathroom.

00:07:49.726 --> 00:07:58.437
But even then, I don't get much of a recess, because they're up asking me questions and like that, or going over business, classroom business.

00:07:59.218 --> 00:08:05.967
So it is really a strenuous effort to teach one of those three hour classes, if you take it seriously.

00:08:06.031 --> 00:08:08.716
All right, and aren't they a little tired also?

00:08:08.857 --> 00:08:09.618
Yes, they are.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.526
But I feel that I did get good results.

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.310
I feel like I got real good results.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:24.428
You do have the advantage that if you're going to get three hours of instruction in a week, if they have to come three different times,

00:08:24.408 --> 00:08:26.432
you've got to get started three different times.

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:27.795
That always takes a few minutes.

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:29.979
And maybe you've got to check attendance.

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:31.742
You've got to greet them.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:38.395
And there's a certain amount of just things you have to do, whether you're going to be meeting for 50 minutes or for three hours.

00:08:39.157 --> 00:08:46.872
And by having it all in one three-hour block, you gain some advantage that way.

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:51.398
I always was teaching thanks to my department head.

00:08:51.438 --> 00:09:00.746
I was teaching things that I was well prepared to teach and didn't have, I never ran out of soap, you know.

00:09:00.786 --> 00:09:03.068
I always had plenty of material.

00:09:04.089 --> 00:09:10.915
And I always made a very deliberate effort to get up for teaching.

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:17.061
You know, I might be laid back the rest of the day

00:09:17.665 --> 00:09:28.143
But when I was in front of my class, I was deliberately trying to be lively and enthusiastic, make them think I thought the subject was worth learning.

00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:34.092
And I did joke some.

00:09:34.633 --> 00:09:39.201
I didn't consider that a waste of time, especially when you've got that much time.

00:09:39.738 --> 00:09:42.424
And, but I try to maintain a light touch.

00:09:43.066 --> 00:09:47.176
Not necessarily any jokes with gag lines, but just a light touch.

00:09:48.319 --> 00:09:51.787
And I feel real good about that part of my career.

00:09:51.827 --> 00:09:57.561
I know it was a difficult thing to do, and I know I didn't do it perfectly, but I

00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:02.817
That's one of the things I feel best about, the way I manage.

00:10:03.177 --> 00:10:07.925
And it takes some physical stamina to do it.

00:10:08.766 --> 00:10:11.229
And I always kept in pretty good shape, you know.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.872
I worked out at the gym every day.

00:10:12.992 --> 00:10:18.300
And I believe that the time I wasted in the gym wasn't wasted.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.184
Now, how did you get started doing that?

00:10:20.264 --> 00:10:23.712
Had you been a gym user before coming here?

00:10:23.732 --> 00:10:24.834
No, I had not.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.237
That was something new for me.

00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:30.707
This was about a year after I'd been here, about a year.

00:10:30.767 --> 00:10:33.673
My family was already here, but about a year after I'd been here.

00:10:34.109 --> 00:10:40.762
The health and physical education department announced a physical fitness program for faculty.

00:10:41.744 --> 00:10:45.872
And the ones that organized it were Carl Landis and Charles McCandless.

00:10:45.892 --> 00:10:51.443
He was in the intramural department, and Charles was, and Carl was in the health and PE department.

00:10:51.423 --> 00:10:53.567
So they had a group of faculty come over there.

00:10:53.627 --> 00:10:57.473
I guess there must have been about 15 to 20 of us.

00:10:57.493 --> 00:10:59.356
Len Hanna was one of them, first day.

00:10:59.417 --> 00:11:00.959
That's where I met him.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:09.093
And at first we would just do calisthenics directed by Charles and Carl.

00:11:09.894 --> 00:11:11.457
And then at the end of the period,

00:11:12.348 --> 00:11:15.373
I guess we spent over an hour, a little over an hour there, about an hour.

00:11:16.074 --> 00:11:17.156
We would do some sport.

00:11:17.236 --> 00:11:20.321
We'd do something different every day for just a few minutes.

00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:21.984
And then one of them we tried was badminton.

00:11:22.725 --> 00:11:23.967
And that became our favorite.

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:32.220
And after a while, we just did that exclusively, dropped the calisthenics even, and became a badminton group.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.103
All right, back to teaching.

00:11:34.792 --> 00:11:39.845
The graduate seminar, how was that?

00:11:39.885 --> 00:11:41.409
You wouldn't be standing up.

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:44.697
You wouldn't be walking around described doing that.

00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:50.792
And what would have been the seminars that you did most often?

00:11:52.460 --> 00:12:00.087
Sometimes I would, by the way, in addition to the introductory course in statistics, I taught less often.

00:12:00.167 --> 00:12:06.033
I taught an intermediate course, which gave a full year course in statistics, which is a pretty good course.

00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:10.217
And then I gave occasionally some advanced topics as seminars.

00:12:10.277 --> 00:12:14.621
Sometimes they were only one semester hour, one hour a week.

00:12:14.641 --> 00:12:21.488
And sometimes, often, very often, I would give seminars on how to get the computer to work, how to get

00:12:22.497 --> 00:12:27.933
introduce your statistical problems to the computer and how to read the output.

00:12:29.117 --> 00:12:34.533
And once in a while I would have other topics, mostly having to do with techniques of research.

00:12:35.596 --> 00:12:37.401
But those were my topics.

00:12:38.984 --> 00:12:41.146
You're right.

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:44.110
I didn't usually stand at those.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.394
It wasn't unusual for me to stand up, and sometimes I would use a chalkboard.

00:12:48.795 --> 00:12:50.236
Did you have an outline of?

00:12:50.377 --> 00:12:52.319
Yes, I'd had notes I'd go by.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:59.847
And I usually didn't have very full notes.

00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:04.232
I just kind of had an outline.

00:13:06.406 --> 00:13:11.477
And I encouraged talk from those in the class.

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:16.307
I probably didn't do 50% of the talking in most of those.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:23.402
Sometimes I did, but I would encourage participation

00:13:23.382 --> 00:13:24.483
group.

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:28.068
And I would even do that in some of the undergraduate courses too if they were smaller ones.

00:13:29.229 --> 00:13:37.018
Now for those advanced, for those graduate courses, you said you graded on the curve, the undergraduate.

00:13:37.038 --> 00:13:42.765
What was your grading technique for those graduate, those seminars and so forth?

00:13:42.785 --> 00:13:44.947
Well I would say still grading on a curve.

00:13:44.967 --> 00:13:46.369
I would start out

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.851
I would have numerical grades for them.

00:13:51.871 --> 00:14:00.291
And then I would place these along a continuum, and I would generally say I believe the person

00:14:02.178 --> 00:14:03.019
will make a B.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.623
If their grades are worse than that, they won't get their B.

00:14:07.524 --> 00:14:09.506
If they're better than that, they'll get an A.

00:14:09.526 --> 00:14:11.308
And a lot of them did, you know, a whole lot of them did.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:15.754
Not too many of them did make, I considered C practically failing.

00:14:15.794 --> 00:14:16.735
Sure, sure.

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:20.699
And so I nearly always assigned B's or A's.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.983
And I maintained the stance

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:33.517
that I'm going to assign a grade of B unless the numbers I have there and the work that they've done convinces me that they could get an A.

00:14:34.038 --> 00:14:35.560
And I wasn't too hard to convince.

00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:38.345
I could be fairly easily convinced of that.

00:14:39.727 --> 00:14:48.520
Did you ever have any outside attempt to influence a grade that you

00:14:49.023 --> 00:14:51.245
gave someone?

00:14:52.567 --> 00:14:57.812
A parent, an administrator, a former student, a legislator, a phone call?

00:14:59.234 --> 00:15:00.575
Did anybody try to tell you to?

00:15:02.718 --> 00:15:04.019
I'm trying to think, Haskell.

00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:05.160
I don't believe so.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:17.173
Now, I have had students themselves, you know, argue about whether they should have got a different grade and... What were some of their explanations?

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:22.284
They really didn't hold much water.

00:15:24.347 --> 00:15:26.211
Sometimes it was just how bad they needed it.

00:15:26.611 --> 00:15:29.195
Oh, okay.

00:15:29.816 --> 00:15:39.212
Now, and I'm assuming you never had any kind of a sad event or a tragic event relative to a student in class or anything?

00:15:41.352 --> 00:15:54.326
I did have, oh, at one time we had that English proficiency test that everybody has to take, I think it's when they're a junior, and I was sometimes assigned to administer that.

00:15:55.307 --> 00:16:06.178
And one time a student, and I knew him, he had been a student of mine too, of course this was not my class, but he fainted.

00:16:07.981 --> 00:16:08.585
Let me see.

00:16:08.605 --> 00:16:09.832
Why did that happen?

00:16:09.852 --> 00:16:12.990
He came to, and so we never did get him to the doctor or anything.

00:16:13.051 --> 00:16:14.700
I advised him to.

00:16:15.473 --> 00:16:17.635
Maybe go by the crack shack.

00:16:17.756 --> 00:16:18.937
Nothing worse than feigning.

00:16:19.077 --> 00:16:19.698
Feigning, yeah.

00:16:19.718 --> 00:16:20.639
But he came too hard.

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:26.205
But I didn't have no way of knowing that at first, you know, so I was kind of shocked by that when he collapsed.

00:16:27.306 --> 00:16:38.038
And you never had, in terms of grades or anything else, you never had the department head or the dean ask you to explain to them what had happened in a certain situation?

00:16:40.027 --> 00:16:40.708
No, I hadn't.

00:16:40.789 --> 00:16:45.358
Now, I have discussed my grading with every one of my supervisors.

00:16:45.598 --> 00:16:58.103
And I guess I was kind of considered the expert, in a way, on that, just due to the particular field I happened to be in.

00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:04.063
because evaluation and testing and that kind of thing was my field.

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:12.291
But I realized that a lot of time the grading is a certain degree of arbitrariness in it.

00:17:13.893 --> 00:17:22.882
And when some students said it's kind of arbitrary that I got this grade rather than another, I couldn't really say no.

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.305
I couldn't deny that.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.488
And but I would say I just have to go by my judgment about it.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:39.801
And so I always did feel that there was some degree of arbitrariness about the assignment of grades.

00:17:39.941 --> 00:17:42.405
But I tried to make it as objective as I could.

00:17:42.526 --> 00:17:50.179
But I never really believed that it, even though I maybe went farther than most people to do that, that I ever

00:17:51.796 --> 00:17:53.377
Was completely correct about that.

00:17:53.397 --> 00:17:58.582
No phone calls in the middle of the night, no notes left on your car or slid under your door.

00:17:59.663 --> 00:18:04.488
Not about grades, but I had lots of people call me, how do you get this computer to take this data?

00:18:05.108 --> 00:18:07.491
I've had that at all times of the night.

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:08.271
Is that right?

00:18:08.291 --> 00:18:08.472
Right.

00:18:09.132 --> 00:18:14.577
One man that called me like that was Barry Thompson when he was a student.

00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:19.542
Did you, you weren't his thesis advisor or anything like that?

00:18:19.562 --> 00:18:20.723
No, I wasn't.

00:18:21.665 --> 00:18:23.929
I was on the committee for Shelby Metcalf too.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.971
Were you?

00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:30.742
We carried, back in those days, the only way to input data to a computer was on cords.

00:18:31.524 --> 00:18:43.386
And a lot of my, the muscles I have come from carrying those huge stacks of, but I remember Shelby Metcalf had a huge stack of cords that I shepherded him around on.

00:18:43.366 --> 00:18:44.929
analysis of his data.

00:18:45.329 --> 00:18:51.841
I was the graduate council representative on his PhD, I believe.

00:18:52.842 --> 00:18:53.844
Didn't he do a doctoral degree?

00:18:53.884 --> 00:18:54.365
Yes, he did.

00:18:54.986 --> 00:18:55.988
I was on that committee too.

00:18:56.388 --> 00:18:59.894
On the factors that affect crowd behavior.

00:19:00.055 --> 00:19:00.255
Right.

00:19:00.275 --> 00:19:01.297
You and I were both on that.

00:19:01.317 --> 00:19:02.539
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:05.762
I'd forgotten that, but that would be right.

00:19:06.703 --> 00:19:10.607
I don't remember anybody calling him Dr. Metcalf after that.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.932
Yeah.

00:19:14.952 --> 00:19:20.178
Let's see, who are some other students that you proudly remember?

00:19:25.663 --> 00:19:27.565
Well, I loved a lot of my students.

00:19:27.705 --> 00:19:29.467
I really was fond of students.

00:19:29.487 --> 00:19:32.070
That was my thing that I was

00:19:32.962 --> 00:19:37.447
And I took the students' side sometimes in disputes.

00:19:39.509 --> 00:19:46.216
Not a specific student, but you know, if somebody would say, well... Over such topics as what?

00:19:46.276 --> 00:19:49.419
Oh, these students aren't any good these days.

00:19:49.459 --> 00:19:51.941
Well I say, yes they are, we've just got to teach them.

00:19:52.362 --> 00:19:55.125
Things like, I would defend students.

00:19:55.825 --> 00:19:57.467
And also when

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:03.892
they would be thinking, well, let's make it harder for students, you know, make it tougher for them.

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:06.715
I'd say, no, it's tough enough for students as it is.

00:20:06.735 --> 00:20:10.160
I was kind of much on the side of the student in disputes of that kind.

00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:12.983
Well, let me see.

00:20:13.764 --> 00:20:14.045
O.B.

00:20:14.065 --> 00:20:15.306
Clifton was a good student.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.151
You know him, I imagine.

00:20:19.592 --> 00:20:24.298
And let's see.

00:20:26.287 --> 00:20:27.791
I'm kind of blocking on that.

00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:30.218
That is a very good question, and I should be able to name a lot.

00:20:30.338 --> 00:20:33.847
Are there some, you recall, that are in high places now?

00:20:34.228 --> 00:20:35.993
Yeah.

00:20:40.445 --> 00:20:49.919
I'm trying to think of that lady from San Antonio whose husband was on the board of directors, Spanish-American.

00:20:49.939 --> 00:20:50.540
Raul Fernandez?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:50.880
Yes.

00:20:51.341 --> 00:21:01.035
His wife was a student of mine that I really liked, had a good relationship with her, and came to, I never taught him, but I met him through her.

00:21:01.015 --> 00:21:09.143
And they put me up for a teaching award given by San Antonio students that had been in my classes one time.

00:21:09.525 --> 00:21:13.017
They, I think, were involved a lot in that.

00:21:19.004 --> 00:21:20.886
Well, let's move on.

00:21:20.966 --> 00:21:28.656
The department grows, and who was the first department head?

00:21:29.717 --> 00:21:31.399
The first was Grady Parker.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:37.187
No, once we had educational psychology, it was Art Roach.

00:21:37.207 --> 00:21:38.468
And then who?

00:21:38.588 --> 00:21:41.252
Chris Borman, I think, followed him, and then Mike Ash.

00:21:43.114 --> 00:21:47.239
And once it gets into real high gear,

00:21:47.573 --> 00:21:51.380
about how many masters and doctoral students a year were you all producing?

00:21:54.165 --> 00:21:54.586
Dozens?

00:21:54.726 --> 00:22:05.044
I think we took in, in the counseling psychology program alone, about 15 to 20 every year.

00:22:06.467 --> 00:22:10.594
And, you know, that can run four years, three or four years.

00:22:11.384 --> 00:22:14.773
Then in school psychology, we'd usually take about 10, I guess.

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:16.398
So that's 20 and 10.

00:22:16.438 --> 00:22:16.960
That's 30.

00:22:18.143 --> 00:22:22.896
And we would have just a very few in development and measurement and things like that.

00:22:23.458 --> 00:22:26.406
So we would take in, I guess, maybe about 30 a year.

00:22:26.386 --> 00:22:31.332
And who were some of the most notable colleagues in the 80s, 90s?

00:22:33.836 --> 00:22:49.656
Well, of course, going back further than that, and I've already mentioned Walter Vorable, number one, and of course Paul Hensling was really important to me and helped me, you know, and was a good department head.

00:22:49.756 --> 00:22:51.398
Department head, yeah.

00:22:51.378 --> 00:23:09.887
But then later, and of course both periods, some of these, Lenny's hope never considered him necessarily the model for a teacher that Varvel was, but he was a real good friend and a real steady, you know, good judgment.

00:23:09.907 --> 00:23:13.913
And I just admired him immensely and still do, and we still get together.

00:23:14.474 --> 00:23:19.562
He's the only one on the faculty that I still get with regularly.

00:23:19.542 --> 00:23:24.048
Jack Campbell.

00:23:24.089 --> 00:23:28.255
He wasn't in my department, but I consider him an outstanding colleague.

00:23:29.456 --> 00:23:47.322
And I don't know how to say this exactly, but I was a little bit, not outwardly, but I was

00:23:47.572 --> 00:23:51.083
a little bit critical of a lot of my colleagues and their teaching.

00:23:51.886 --> 00:23:54.815
Not necessarily in my own department, but in the university.

00:23:55.457 --> 00:23:56.400
I thought some of them

00:23:58.085 --> 00:24:15.303
didn't devote as much time as they should to preparation and instruction, and didn't take students as seriously as they should, and particularly didn't do as good a job of testing.

00:24:15.564 --> 00:24:27.096
Of course, I know I'm coming from a biased point of view on that, because of that being my field of expertise.

00:24:28.088 --> 00:24:36.504
I don't know if it's appropriate for me to say that, but I just was always thinking I don't think my colleagues are doing as well as they could by the students.

00:24:37.746 --> 00:24:42.635
And I don't think that I think at A&M it might have been better than some other places.

00:24:42.675 --> 00:24:46.182
This is a criticism I have of higher education after many years in it.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:25:04.426
Am I the only one who thinks there may have been a generational change that you and I thought we were to be here all day, whereas the younger, newer go to campus, meet class, keep a brief posted office hour, and then gone?

00:25:04.446 --> 00:25:05.667
Right.

00:25:05.687 --> 00:25:11.353
I thought we were to be either in our office or in the library doing research, one or the other.

00:25:11.453 --> 00:25:12.193
That's what I thought.

00:25:12.554 --> 00:25:16.337
Either there or on the badminton court.

00:25:16.317 --> 00:25:26.891
Dean Hubert becomes chancellor in the late 70s, and he is replaced by Dean Corrigan, Dean Dean.

00:25:27.852 --> 00:25:29.794
Describe him as the dean of education.

00:25:29.935 --> 00:25:32.838
Now I guess Phil Limbacher came in there for a while in between, didn't he?

00:25:32.858 --> 00:25:34.160
Yes, yes, as the interim.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:34.440
Right.

00:25:35.201 --> 00:25:40.648
Of course, I'd known Phil real well before and worked with him, and he's a favorite of mine, too.

00:25:40.708 --> 00:25:42.350
I liked him, Phil, a lot and still do.

00:25:42.991 --> 00:25:44.333
And I still see him once in a while.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.662
Dean Corrigan, same thing.

00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:51.166
I hadn't known him before, but we hit it off pretty well.

00:25:51.566 --> 00:25:55.289
We didn't have much occasion to be together, but when we were, we were.

00:25:57.351 --> 00:26:04.257
Describe how he deemed, how did he, what was his manner and style?

00:26:04.277 --> 00:26:10.263
Well, I don't know what to say about that.

00:26:10.283 --> 00:26:12.885
I thought he was...

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.824
He was intense.

00:26:17.026 --> 00:26:18.550
He was real active.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.637
He was real enthusiastic.

00:26:24.643 --> 00:26:27.971
But as far as details are concerned, he just left it to the faculty.

00:26:29.895 --> 00:26:31.819
He didn't tell me how to teach statistics.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.895
And I didn't tell him how to be a dean either.

00:26:36.117 --> 00:26:42.650
But I didn't notice a whole lot of difference between him and Limbacher, the way their style was.

00:26:43.512 --> 00:26:52.930
And then I also was under the dean that followed him, Jane

00:26:54.226 --> 00:26:54.666
Connolly?

00:26:55.187 --> 00:26:55.407
No.

00:26:56.749 --> 00:26:57.509
They were both Janes.

00:26:59.051 --> 00:27:01.633
That's strange that I would block on her name.

00:27:02.114 --> 00:27:03.175
See, that's all I've got.

00:27:03.255 --> 00:27:05.677
I don't describe her as dean.

00:27:06.338 --> 00:27:13.285
As Carl was saying, I didn't notice much difference between any of the deans I had, with the possible exception of Dean Hubert.

00:27:13.726 --> 00:27:14.566
We discussed that.

00:27:15.087 --> 00:27:24.216
But even with him, they seemed to be very good about not managing

00:27:24.196 --> 00:27:30.728
They allowed the teaching to be done by the professors.

00:27:30.828 --> 00:27:34.435
Now you all moved over to the Harrington Building.

00:27:34.976 --> 00:27:36.178
Right.

00:27:36.198 --> 00:27:42.390
And where were you all officed and where did your classes meet normally?

00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:45.058
Well, my office was on the eighth floor.

00:27:45.118 --> 00:27:47.081
It's nine floors altogether.

00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:51.948
I was on the eighth floor in the corner and stayed there the whole time until I retired.

00:27:53.250 --> 00:28:01.702
And it was convenient to the main office, you know, where the secretarial administrative staff was.

00:28:03.184 --> 00:28:06.549
And it was right next door to the department head's office.

00:28:06.569 --> 00:28:09.373
And on the other side of me was Bob Riley.

00:28:11.243 --> 00:28:14.428
And we were very proud of our new facilities.

00:28:14.468 --> 00:28:15.309
They were very nice.

00:28:18.153 --> 00:28:21.217
There weren't any classrooms or hardly any classrooms in that building.

00:28:21.277 --> 00:28:26.785
We sometimes had a small seminar in there, maybe a very small class, graduate class.

00:28:26.865 --> 00:28:31.412
But we had that classroom building adjacent to Harrington.

00:28:31.983 --> 00:28:34.166
We had Tall Harrington and Short Harrington.

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:40.936
And I always thought it was so odd that we would call a building Short Harrington when it was named after a man that was over six feet tall.

00:28:43.199 --> 00:28:45.823
But I taught all over the campus then.

00:28:45.863 --> 00:28:48.026
That was not adequate for our classes at all.

00:28:48.086 --> 00:28:51.791
And we didn't have exclusive use of that for our classes by any means.

00:28:52.873 --> 00:28:56.237
Many other departments were teaching in there.

00:28:56.658 --> 00:28:57.639
So I went everywhere.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.585
You can name a building on this side of the tracks that I didn't teach in.

00:29:02.273 --> 00:29:13.871
Has Texas A&M done a good job in its physical planning of classrooms and parking and streets and so forth?

00:29:13.891 --> 00:29:15.233
See, I think they haven't.

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:15.594
Well.

00:29:18.418 --> 00:29:19.180
In hindsight.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:26.130
It's kind of hard to imagine it being any worse as far as traffic is concerned, but it's almost an impossible problem.

00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:30.357
I don't know that I could give a better solution.

00:29:30.978 --> 00:29:38.549
I always, I just got here in the morning and left my car, and I parked over here back in Nagel, very convenient.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:44.859
And it was sometimes hard to get a parking place there if you didn't get there early, but I did, and I left late.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:49.867
So I never had a parking problem, I just never used my car.

00:29:50.988 --> 00:29:55.695
I walked everywhere, and that worked fine.

00:29:57.538 --> 00:29:58.740
But yeah,

00:30:00.695 --> 00:30:04.421
I believe it's a problem that I just don't see any solution to at all.

00:30:04.882 --> 00:30:07.105
I don't really criticize what's been done.

00:30:07.125 --> 00:30:16.240
Of course the decision was made not to allow cars to come into the center of the campus.

00:30:18.717 --> 00:30:23.743
But that's kind of bad, because sometimes maybe a person's handicapped.

00:30:23.803 --> 00:30:27.588
Or when I was moving things out of my office, that was terrible.

00:30:27.888 --> 00:30:33.715
I had to make hundreds of trips to get to my car.

00:30:33.795 --> 00:30:36.539
And fortunately, it was fairly close, but it was still hard.

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:38.241
It's hard to move things in and out.

00:30:38.541 --> 00:30:41.224
And I know that's part of the everyday work of the university.

00:30:41.244 --> 00:30:45.990
I only had to do it once.

00:30:46.561 --> 00:30:48.164
That's a bad problem, traffic.

00:30:48.445 --> 00:30:50.148
Did you and your colleagues think that...

00:30:50.168 --> 00:30:51.711
The bus service was never very good either.

00:30:52.272 --> 00:31:02.072
I considered riding those buses sometimes and sometimes they wouldn't let me on or, you know, didn't make me feel welcome on being on those buses.

00:31:02.845 --> 00:31:07.693
And the pattern was that individual faculty members came in their car.

00:31:08.074 --> 00:31:08.595
Absolutely.

00:31:08.615 --> 00:31:09.356
In almost every car.

00:31:09.376 --> 00:31:09.917
No carpool.

00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:13.443
You never were a biker to and from campus.

00:31:13.463 --> 00:31:14.645
No, I only took that up afterward.

00:31:14.685 --> 00:31:15.587
Now I bike every day.

00:31:16.869 --> 00:31:25.343
And when we moved where we did, one consideration was Don can walk to work, but there weren't more than a dozen times over those years that I actually did.
