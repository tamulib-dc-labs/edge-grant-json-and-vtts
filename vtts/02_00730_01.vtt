00:02.933 --> 00:18.692
First of all, Mr. Crane, would you tell us 
something about your early life, including the

00:02.933 --> 00:18.692
names of your parents, the dates of their birth and 
death, perhaps, where they were born, where you

00:02.933 --> 00:18.692
were born, and the schools you attended before you 
entered Texas A&M? All right. My father was born on

00:20.754 --> 00:30.426
March the 23rd, 1862, in Hunt County. My mother was 
born on January the 12th, 1873, also in Hunt

00:31.638 --> 00:40.571
County. They didn't know each other when they were 
young, but they were born in the same vicinity. I

00:46.138 --> 00:55.592
was born in Lone Oak, or near Lone Oak, in Hunt 
County in March 11th, 1908. Your father's name

00:56.773 --> 00:58.175
was? Joel Arthur, Jr. He was a junior. My mother was 
Hattie Dyle. D-I-A-L. D-I-A-L.

01:06.629 --> 01:15.701
And I was, well, as I've already said, when I was 
born. And moved to Cumbee, which is a small town in

01:16.502 --> 01:24.833
Hopkins County, just across the line, when I was 
about 13 years old. But I was raised for 13 years on a

01:24.874 --> 01:27.497
farm. and attended public schools in Cumbie and a 
rural one-teacher school in Lonella for the

01:28.996 --> 01:47.943
first,

01:28.996 --> 01:47.943
let's see, about seventh or eighth grade, I guess.

01:47.963 --> 01:49.064
Eighth, ninth, tenth. Yeah, about sixth grade, a 
rural one-teacher school. Larry Bird's

01:52.809 --> 01:53.991
always... bragging about he had a four-teacher 
school. I said, man, you're the big shot. Because I

01:59.751 --> 02:06.079
had one teacher, and she taught everybody 
everything that was taught. And I said, you were an

02:06.099 --> 02:10.384
aristocrat because I just had one teacher. But 
then when we moved to Cumbie, of course, that was a

02:11.565 --> 02:17.432
10th grade high school. It only went to the 10th 
grade. So I had to go to Sulphur Springs, the 11th

02:19.574 --> 02:23.539
grade, in order to get enough credits to attend A&M 
College, because Cumbie was not affiliated and

02:24.278 --> 02:35.269
didn't go far enough in the grades to allow me to 
attend A&M. I could have gone and taken them exams,

02:35.450 --> 02:45.180
but I decided I'd go one more year of high school and 
went to Suffer Springs, which is the county seat of

02:35.450 --> 02:45.180
Hopkins County. So at this point, if you completed 
a non-affiliated school, you'd have to have an

02:51.565 --> 02:54.650
exam to enter A&M. Right. I could have come to A&M 
and taken an exam, an entrance exam, had I passed,

02:54.890 --> 03:02.702
they'd have said, okay. But I preferred to go to 
school until I had my credits, because really I

03:02.722 --> 03:17.404
was, in 1925, I was only 17 years old, and frankly, I 
don't think that I was necessarily ready to go to

03:02.722 --> 03:17.404
college. I preferred to go another year to high 
school, in other words, so I went to Sulphur

03:17.823 --> 03:24.773
Springs. What factors were involved in your 
choice of Texas A&M? Banker in Cumbie, where I

03:29.981 --> 03:37.612
lived from 1921 until I went off to college in 26. A 
banker, two of the bankers, one of them was a vice

03:39.334 --> 03:47.526
president, one of them was a cashier of the bank, 
both of them had been to A&M. And, of course, they

03:48.383 --> 03:50.566
recommended it highly. And then the last year in 
high school in Sulphur Springs, one of my

03:51.968 --> 04:00.459
classmates had a brother who was in A&M that year. 
And he was very high on recommending. He was in the

04:06.087 --> 04:11.134
band, but he highly recommended A&M as a place to go 
to school. and I wanted to take some kind of

04:11.823 --> 04:14.569
engineering. I really wasn't sure what kind, 
except I didn't want to pick cotton or chop cotton,

04:14.589 --> 04:20.000
so I wanted to be an engineer. I thought that 
sounded a lot easier than picking cotton, because

04:20.801 --> 04:28.617
I'd had my time at picking cotton, and I didn't 
really care for it. And those things together,

04:29.440 --> 04:43.480
knowing the people and wanting an engineering 
degree, and A&M did have a good reputation for

04:29.440 --> 04:43.480
engineering, anything agricultural or 
engineering. And, of course, still does for that

04:43.500 --> 04:45.322
matter. And that's what made the decision. And I 
understood that it wasn't an expensive college,

04:48.187 --> 04:55.617
that you could go reasonably cheap. And I had to do 
that because I had to work all the time I was in

04:55.867 --> 04:59.813
college. And there seemed to be more 
opportunities from what I could find out talking

05:00.795 --> 05:07.465
to the fellows who had been down there. What 
procedures did you have to go through to enter the

05:07.485 --> 05:11.371
school? I had no problem after I finished Sulphur 
Spring High School. My credits were sent to A&M,

05:17.180 --> 05:20.765
and there was no problem at all. It was just a matter 
of registering. Did the school notify you that you

05:22.368 --> 05:25.553
were acceptable? No. As I recall, I went down 
there. I went to school, period, and got down there

05:30.240 --> 05:35.087
early. and went through the process of 
registering and submitting my paper. Now, I could

05:39.649 --> 05:41.292
have written them. I'm not sure about that, 
Charles, because that's been there to a goal. But

05:48.086 --> 05:53.357
it seems to me that I went to A&M with the idea, well, 
you can get in. You've got the credits, because the

05:53.417 --> 05:56.603
credits had already been sent. And I just went down 
there and went through the process of

05:57.494 --> 06:02.201
registration. I didn't pre-register or apply for 
admittance. Back in 1926, they were pretty glad to

06:07.027 --> 06:11.954
get anybody from anywhere. They even take me 
without questioning too much. What were your

06:17.491 --> 06:23.720
first reactions to the school and to the 
community, what there was of it? Well, my first

06:23.860 --> 06:32.091
reaction to A&M College, Charles, was that had 
there been another train, I'd have gone back home.

06:32.632 --> 06:34.715
That was my first reaction. Because I got on the 
train in Dallas, and there were two or three

06:34.735 --> 06:46.030
seniors in Company E Infantry on the train going 
down at the same time the freshmen were going, a

06:34.735 --> 06:46.030
week ahead of time, you know. And I got, I was, I 
guess you'd call it harassed or heckled or

06:47.562 --> 06:53.913
whatever. They didn't mistreat us, but they saw 
that we didn't get any sleep on the train going

06:53.954 --> 07:00.365
down. They got down there. Of course, we had to 
carry some of the luggage up to the YMCA, which was

07:02.088 --> 07:06.216
all right. I was a strong back and a weak mind, and I 
didn't mind that. But I walked up to the YMCA

07:10.107 --> 07:18.998
fountain out in front, the old YMCA, and drank some 
of that black water. It used to be just full of

07:19.899 --> 07:21.661
sulfur. It looked like you'd spilled a bottle of 
ink in it as it came out. And took a drink of that, and

07:25.406 --> 07:31.574
I stood up, and I said, God, if I can find a train, I'm 
going home. Was this a water fountain? It's a water

07:33.817 --> 07:34.898
fountain. That was the type of water they had there 
because it was highly concentrated with... Uh...

07:40.803 --> 07:48.641
Oh, hydro... No, not hydrocarbon. Uh... some type 
of a of a mineral that actually it tasted and

07:49.173 --> 08:11.518
smelled and looked like it came out of somebody's 
sewage tank it is awful stuff i ever saw i'd been

07:49.173 --> 08:11.518
raised on uh rainwater and brother that was so 
different and no food and i would have gone home

07:49.173 --> 08:11.518
right then we got there about six o'clock in the 
morning just good daylight And I got a drink of that

08:12.612 --> 08:18.078
water, and I'm not joking, if it had been a train 
back to Dallas, I'd have gone back home right then.

08:18.758 --> 08:21.841
Because that was just too much. Well, 
fortunately, there wasn't a train until, I think,

08:22.362 --> 08:25.425
the next day. Well, by then, I'd gotten so busy, I'd 
forgot about the water. And really, the first

08:29.129 --> 08:31.231
drink was the worst. From there on, it was

08:31.371 --> 08:38.198
drinkable, but it still wasn't good water. But I 
got used to it and got carried away with thick malt

08:38.887 --> 08:48.880
and milks at old Jeff Casey and Bill Sparks' 
drugstore there in the YMCA. And for a quarter,

08:49.621 --> 08:55.810
which I didn't have very many of, you could get a big 
old glass of thick malt. And, brother, you talk

08:56.771 --> 09:02.879
about somebody that ate his share of those things 
until my quarters ran out. So I really didn't have

09:04.722 --> 09:07.105
to drink too much of the water. Was there anybody to 
meet, to train, to try to recruit you for a military

09:08.047 --> 09:14.835
company? No, no, they didn't care what happened to 
you. They figured you'd fall into a slot

09:17.919 --> 09:20.783
somewhere. And when I registered, I think they 
said, what do you want to be in? And it seems to me, as

09:25.068 --> 09:32.637
I recall, now some of this is a little fuzzy on the 
edges, but Seems to be, I said, well, I don't know

09:32.617 --> 09:35.540
anything to do except walk. I never rode a horse 
enough to get in the cavalry, and I don't know

09:35.640 --> 09:40.724
anything about guns in the artillery. And those 
were the three main, infantry, artillery, signal

09:41.685 --> 09:48.991
corps, and cavalry, I believe, were the main one. 
And I said, I guess you better make a foot soldier

09:49.011 --> 09:51.413
out of me. And that's how come I, well, do you have 
any preference on the company? No, I don't care

09:54.916 --> 09:57.278
what company or where. I didn't know anybody 
anywhere. I didn't know a soul down there except

09:59.400 --> 10:02.623
the boy. that from Sulphur Springs, a classmate 
that had a brother in A&M the year we finished high

10:03.397 --> 10:12.188
school. Now, of course, he was going down there. 
And he had decided he wanted to be in artillery. And

10:17.495 --> 10:21.820
he had just about as much reason for being in 
artillery as I did in infantry. But we didn't get

10:21.860 --> 10:26.926
together on that because he was going another 
direction. And so I ended up in Company D infantry,

10:27.067 --> 10:32.273
I believe it was. Si Stratton was captain of the 
company and president of the senior class that

10:34.025 --> 10:41.134
year, I believe. Si Stratton. What dormitory was 
that? In Milner. In Milner. It was one of the fairly

10:45.140 --> 10:46.662
new ones. Yeah, it was fairly new. It was over by the 
mess hall. The mess hall, you know, was brand new in

10:49.045 --> 10:57.016
26, and it was close to the mess hall, and I was 
delighted with the company I had. It was across

10:57.036 --> 11:01.922
from the post office, so it used to be over near 
Gatheride, the old band hall. And the

11:02.695 --> 11:12.125
post office was right next door to it, just right 
across the street from Milner. And it seemed to me a

11:13.026 --> 11:17.411
very good place to be. Were you in the same 
dormitory the whole time you were there? No, I was

11:21.395 --> 11:32.247
in that dormitory, though, for my freshman, 
sophomore, and part of my junior year. I got out of

11:33.340 --> 11:43.133
the Corps at the end of my sophomore year because at 
that time you made a choice as to whether you were

11:33.340 --> 11:43.133
going to stay in ROTC or not. And I was working every 
spare minute I had and the uniform cost a little

11:43.814 --> 11:55.089
more than my fatigues that I could wear working and 
single uniform that I wore in the Corps. So going

11:55.870 --> 12:00.276
into the junior year, I decided I'd get out of the 
Corps because The military took some of your time,

12:00.897 --> 12:06.023
and as I say, the clothes were a little more 
expensive. So after two years, yeah, two years, I

12:06.624 --> 12:22.645
got out of the military, moved over into 
non-military hall, which was civilian

12:06.624 --> 12:22.645
non-military, which you could do at the end of two 
years. For how long had that been the custom, or do

12:23.365 --> 12:26.289
you know? You mean getting out of the military? 
Yeah. Well, it was optional, as I recall, Charles,

12:28.859 --> 12:34.407
back when I went to school. All you had to take was 
two years. If you took the other two years, or

12:38.313 --> 12:46.125
junior and senior years, that's when you had some 
military allowance for your clothes. In other

12:46.145 --> 12:55.018
words, I could have gotten some help with my 
uniforms and that type of thing, but I figured that

12:46.145 --> 12:55.018
I'd be better off working as much as I did not to be in 
the Corps. And as I recall, it's been two-year

12:56.163 --> 13:02.351
optional, was, and had been for a good while. Now, 
how long, I don't know. Quite possibly shortly

13:04.774 --> 13:06.456
after the war. Well, that's what I kind of think. 
After the war, they said, okay, two years is all you

13:08.538 --> 13:12.503
have to take. And then your junior and senior years 
was entirely optional. Well, I elected to go

13:17.129 --> 13:24.398
non-military for two years, and then my fifth 
year, I took five years to graduate, actually. My

13:25.323 --> 13:31.150
fifth year, they went back to uniforms for 
non-military students. So in my fifth year, I was,

13:31.170 --> 13:37.117
I don't know, I don't remember the title. I think I 
was dorm master or dormitory supervisor in my

13:37.137 --> 13:47.249
senior year, but I had to wear a uniform. We had an 
NM, non-military insignia, on our collars. It's

13:50.893 --> 13:51.634
like... Calvary or infantry had their type of 
insignia. So it was the same uniform as the...

13:59.106 --> 14:03.070
Right, except for the emblems, and we did not wear 
boots. And being in charge of the dorm, I got some

14:04.611 --> 14:10.638
living allowance for that. So as I say, it took me 
five years to graduate. I don't guess I had to take

14:14.382 --> 14:20.288
five years, but I wasn't in a big hurry, and I was 
working ever... every opportunity. I did

14:22.817 --> 14:31.014
everything from milk Dr. Marsh's cow to wait on 
tables in the mess hall and hotel and over at the ag

14:22.817 --> 14:31.014
land. And really, I worked so much that I really 
couldn't take as many hours as I probably could

14:32.116 --> 14:42.597
have, you know, if I'd have been determined to get 
out in four years. Could you have any idea or make an

14:45.626 --> 14:53.839
estimate of the percentage of students who were 
not in the military the last two years?

14:57.364 --> 15:00.169
There wasn't a great deal, wasn't a great number. 
As I recall, we had two dormitories, old, well,

15:00.269 --> 15:10.525
I swear, two old wooden halls. Alpha and Beta. Two 
old wooden buildings. Alpha and Beta were

15:15.414 --> 15:20.522
non-military and now I don't know how many people 
those held. And there were a few that didn't stay on

15:20.862 --> 15:24.187
the campus that were non-military. Were they 
local? Yeah, local boys and lived close to Bryan or

15:25.149 --> 15:34.302
in and around Bryan and they weren't in the 
military.

15:37.066 --> 15:45.439
George, I'd be scared to guess at how many out of 
the, let's see, we had in 1927, I believe we had

15:37.066 --> 15:45.439
2,000 students. I would say 10% of them. That's a 
wild guess, but... I was going to say, if there were

15:51.437 --> 15:54.160
only two dollars, probably not more than a couple 
hundred. That's right. I'd say 10% were

15:55.021 --> 15:59.966
non-military for various reasons. Not all of them 
my reasons. Some of them were partially crippled.

16:04.070 --> 16:05.311
They actually couldn't have been in it. They 
weren't in the civilian... I mean, they weren't in

16:07.033 --> 16:08.995
the military any time. I mean, they registered as a 
non-military. The only way you could register and

16:12.919 --> 16:16.422
not take two years of... military, as I recall, you 
had to be physically handicapped in some way that

16:16.402 --> 16:26.491
tended to make it hard for you to drill or, you know, 
march and so forth. And there were, I guess,

16:27.392 --> 16:41.886
counting everybody, those that didn't chose to 
take the last two years and those that were

16:27.392 --> 16:41.886
physically disabled, I'd say between 10 and 15 
percent. I'd hate to try to get it any closer than

16:42.647 --> 16:46.290
that. You mentioned some of the jobs which you had 
when you were on campus, like working in the mess

16:47.198 --> 16:54.248
hall and waiting tables. Was this to Aggieland? 
Yeah. Do you remember how much you earned there per

16:56.952 --> 17:00.297
hour? No, I don't. Mostly, I got food and a place to 
stay. You didn't get any money, really, for

17:06.727 --> 17:08.810
working. You got subsistence. And the mess hall 
job... I had a job in a mess hall. Then after I lost

17:19.862 --> 17:26.573
that job, overslept one morning and got fired, so I 
went over to Agland Inn and got a job. And it was a

17:27.715 --> 17:33.945
little better pay because you actually got some 
pay plus your food. But Charles, to try to tell you

17:35.512 --> 17:44.143
what it was, compared to today's incomes and 
prices, it wasn't much, I guarantee. But it was an

17:44.163 --> 17:48.429
awful lot to me, and it was an awful lot to any of 
those kids that were working. Today the student's

17:48.449 --> 17:50.912
labor gets $1.90 an hour. That's right. And, Lord, 
if I made $1.90 all day, I'd have felt like I was

17:51.573 --> 17:56.199
rich. You could have bought a whole bunch of them. 
Oh, good Lord. I picked up paper and poked...

18:00.925 --> 18:08.014
scraps of paper with a nail for many, many hours of 
days for 20 cents and 25 cents an hour. And I mean, we

18:08.034 --> 18:09.276
worked at it. We didn't just stand around and talk. 
We, as they say about the old wagon train, wheel

18:10.998 --> 18:21.672
out, or what's that expression they say? Anyway, 
you know, when they start them out on the road. And

18:24.255 --> 18:25.837
we had somebody watching us. But it was an awful lot 
then. because it's the only way I could go to

18:30.119 --> 18:32.847
school. Dad provided a little bit of money, but he 
didn't have an awful lot of money, and my mother

18:33.930 --> 18:39.505
didn't have a lot of money. They separated the year 
I went off to high school. In the late 20s, was this

18:43.862 --> 18:53.516
the time period when they had the project houses, 
the beginnings of the project houses, or did that

18:43.862 --> 18:53.516
come after you left? That came after. You know, 
when the Depression really hit in 29 and 30 and 31 is

18:56.460 --> 19:02.949
when they started the project houses. They did not 
have any while I was there, or I'd have probably

19:02.969 --> 19:09.559
been in one because they say that was a pretty good, 
easy way to... go to school. It was much easier

19:10.814 --> 19:13.399
financially.

19:16.424 --> 19:19.890
I think they started the first of those either in 31 
or 32. I'm not sure. Could

19:22.114 --> 19:30.328
you as a non-military student wait tables in the 
mess hall? Oh, yeah. You were hired there. by the

19:33.704 --> 19:42.625
sergeant in charge of the waiters, and he didn't 
care whether you were in the military or a general

19:33.704 --> 19:42.625
or a corporal or a non-military. As long as he had 
enough people to do the job. That's right. Could

19:48.058 --> 19:50.143
you describe a typical day Now, I imagine you could 
describe two typical days because the two years

19:52.351 --> 20:08.253
you were in the military would have one kind of 
schedule, and the two years you were in the years

19:52.351 --> 20:08.253
you were not military, you had a little different 
rules, I believe. The two years I was in the

20:08.333 --> 20:18.487
military was part of that time in my sophomore 
years when I milked

20:08.333 --> 20:18.487
Dr. Marsh's cow every morning. Well, that was 
supposed to be at 5 o'clock in the morning. And then

20:22.591 --> 20:26.897
I had, when I got through that, I came back and made 
Reveille. And after Reveille, I went and waited

20:27.598 --> 20:29.841
tables. And then, of course, go to class and come 
back and wait tables at noon and then in the

20:30.943 --> 20:35.769
afternoon. And then once a week, we had to drill 
half a day. But my days were pretty long when I was

20:39.875 --> 20:44.782
milking that old cow, but I finally had to give that 
up. Dr. Marsh, he was an awful nice man. He was a

20:49.088 --> 20:50.590
school doctor. And he was very polite about it, but 
he said, Oscar, he says, I think you're working too

20:51.599 --> 20:58.766
much. I think you better quit this job. Well, the 
truth of the matter, the old cow was drying up

21:01.829 --> 21:07.355
because I'd milk her at 5 o'clock one morning. The 
next morning I'd oversleep, and it'd be between 7

21:07.876 --> 21:13.081
and 8 before I'd get down there to milk her. And as a 
result, you cannot milk a cow. You've got to milk

21:17.505 --> 21:19.007
regular. In other words, I don't know how much you 
know about cows, but they have to be milked pretty

21:19.223 --> 21:26.613
regular or they'll dry up. So he very politely 
eased me out of my milking job, which I was grateful

21:27.574 --> 21:39.470
for because I don't think I got but $5 a month to milk 
her every morning and evening, every day of the

21:27.574 --> 21:39.470
month. Well, that's an awful lot of milking for $5, 
but $5 was $5. But he very politely eased me out of

21:44.755 --> 21:54.306
that job because she was going dry, and he didn't 
want to just fire me because he was too

21:44.755 --> 21:54.306
soft-hearted for that. So he just said, I think 
you're working too hard. It's not good for you. You

21:57.490 --> 21:58.051
quit. And I did. And about that time is when I lost my 
job as waiter in the mess hall and then got my job

22:00.253 --> 22:07.142
over at the Agland Inn. So that was in your 
sophomore year. Yeah. And then during my junior

22:10.666 --> 22:13.429
year, I worked at the Agland Inn. Junior and senior 
year, yeah. That was all the way through the last

22:16.400 --> 22:18.865
few years. Yeah, that's right. Well, what about 
the fifth year, or is that what you call your senior

22:19.506 --> 22:24.274
year? Well, that was what I call my senior year, and 
that's the year that I was dorm... Well, I think

22:30.166 --> 22:39.257
they called us dorm mothers or something, and I got 
paid for being in charge of the dormitory, and I

22:30.166 --> 22:39.257
didn't have to work at the mess hall. That would 
have been in either alpha or beta. No, no. We had a

22:41.880 --> 22:48.909
new one, the bachelor's quarters, a dormitory 
that's been gone for many, many years, bachelor's

22:41.880 --> 22:48.909
quarters. It was a place that... bachelor 
professors lived that taught at the college

22:53.150 --> 23:13.065
called it bachelor's quarters and they finally 
left that open for non-military students my fifth

22:53.150 --> 23:13.065
year and that's where I stayed and that was the dorm 
that I was in charge of and we had I don't remember

22:53.150 --> 23:13.065
how many non-military students I'd say Well, 
still had nearly the 10%, I would guess. Probably a

23:18.270 --> 23:23.237
little less than there was the two years I lived in 
Alpha or Beta. Alpha's where I lived, in Alpha.

23:27.363 --> 23:35.796
During the two years that you were in the military, 
right after Reveille, did you have exercises

23:27.363 --> 23:35.796
before you went to breakfast? We had exercises at 
Reveille. Yeah, that's what you did at Reveille.

23:40.943 --> 23:44.268
You'd march a little, and you'd go through 
calisthenics. And then go back to your room. Go

23:45.991 --> 23:51.180
back to your room, and then we'd form in line again a 
little bit later and march to breakfast. You

23:51.200 --> 24:01.918
marched to all meals, and in the morning at 
Reveille, we'd have our calisthenics and

23:51.200 --> 24:01.918
marching exercises and go back to the dorm and and 
for just a very few minutes and then would fall out

24:02.843 --> 24:14.175
again to march into the mess hall for breakfast.

24:14.195 --> 24:19.721
And then did you have an inspection every day or 
this would be room inspection, I guess? As I

24:20.101 --> 24:24.646
recall, we had room inspection almost every day, 
sometime during the day. I don't recall that it was

24:24.666 --> 24:27.889
always in the morning. But then on our drill day, we 
had a very rigid inspection. As I recall, once a

24:34.413 --> 24:40.598
week, we had room inspection that was pretty 
thorough. That was, I believe, our drill day. Then

24:43.641 --> 24:55.531
every day during the week, a captain or his 
lieutenant or somebody would come around and make

24:43.641 --> 24:55.531
just a kind of a cursory examination, just say how 
y'all boys doing. And who inspected you then on

24:55.591 --> 24:58.213
drill day? Same ones. And most of the time, there 
would be an Army regular lieutenant or a captain

25:00.264 --> 25:11.701
come with whoever inspected on drill day. In other 
words, a lot of times. Now, I don't recall that the

25:13.143 --> 25:23.779
Army personnel, you know, they had regular Army 
personnel stationed there that helped with the

25:13.143 --> 25:23.779
military or helped direct the military. And I 
don't recall that there was always an Army officer

25:28.619 --> 25:32.903
on the drill day, but pretty regular he would show 
up. Because I remember one old Captain Ware, the

25:33.444 --> 25:40.071
old so-and-so, I didn't have any money to get a 
haircut, and he gave me 50 cents to get my haircut.

25:40.091 --> 25:40.891
He made me mad. I should have thanked him, but it 
hurt my feelings. He

25:45.016 --> 25:50.321
said, Fish, that was when I was a freshman. He said, 
Fish Crane, you get you a haircut. Here's 50 cents.

25:54.866 --> 25:55.586
Captain Ware. Where'd you get a haircut? They had a 
barbershop over in Hawaii where Casey and Sparks'

25:57.256 --> 26:02.803
drugstore was. This was kind of a private 
concession then? Yeah, they were

26:05.586 --> 26:10.452
concessionaires in the YMCA. And then I believe 
when I first started to school, there was a

26:10.472 --> 26:21.846
drugstore down at what we called the North Gate. I 
think that drugstore was there. I'm not too—

26:24.679 --> 26:28.363
That'd be in the area there behind Speezer Hall, 
then. Yeah, on down—well, over there where that

26:28.483 --> 26:34.329
farm road goes east and west down there. Agilent 
Pharmacy, I believe, was there for many, many

26:34.910 --> 26:38.193
years. The reason I'm pretty sure that was because 
Methodist Church was down there in that same area,

26:38.893 --> 26:51.566
and that's where I went to church usually, Sunday

26:38.893 --> 26:51.566
school. Thank you. say life was like in, say, both 
the military dorm and in the civilian dorm in the

26:52.893 --> 27:02.023
last couple of years? Well, I frankly liked both of 
them. Charles, really, I liked the military

27:09.852 --> 27:20.344
because I enjoyed the marching, and, well, I 
didn't even mind the drill once a week that we had.

27:20.424 --> 27:21.786
In fact, I kind of enjoyed it. But it was a matter of 
you can't stay clean and dressed up in a uniform and

27:22.610 --> 27:32.079
work every spare hour you have. You've got to go 
change, and I just couldn't do it. And I would say

27:35.523 --> 27:40.547
that the military was the greatest pleasure I had. 
Living in the dorm as a military student was

27:41.548 --> 27:48.415
probably more just real enjoyment because you had 
a little closer association with your fellow

27:49.137 --> 27:58.995
classmates in the company that you were in. than 
you did as civilian or non-military, because over

27:59.330 --> 28:11.924
in the civilian or non-military group, everybody 
was going their own way, and you really didn't have

27:59.330 --> 28:11.924
the close friends there that you did when you were 
in military. But I'd say this, I enjoyed both of

28:11.944 --> 28:14.347
them thoroughly. If you worked such a job as 
cleaning out the stables, did you have to wear your

28:14.507 --> 28:20.314
uniform even while you were doing that? No, no. If 
you were going somewhere and you met an Army

28:22.496 --> 28:28.543
officer or an officer of the day and he says, 
so-and-so, where are you going? You tell him where

28:30.648 --> 28:36.674
you're going, he wouldn't give you a non-reg slip. 
But if you wandered around too much and didn't have

28:37.575 --> 28:48.166
a specific destination, you could be given, as I 
recall, a non-reg demerit. So you could wear

28:49.667 --> 28:53.932
something other than your uniform. Right, when I 
was working, right. In fact, I think a lot of them

28:57.683 --> 29:04.733
used the excuse, and if I'm not mistaken, I have, 
when really I wasn't going to work. I was going

29:04.793 --> 29:11.923
somewhere, but I didn't have

29:04.793 --> 29:11.923
a uniform on. So the life then in the non-military 
dorm was a good bit different.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.835
more segregated individually. Right. Because, 
see, we didn't have call to quarters like you do in

29:23.656 --> 29:27.819
the military dorm. At 7.30 of the night, the bell 
rung or somebody blew a whistle, and you got to your

29:28.020 --> 29:33.665
room and you stayed there. You got out, you got 
permission to get out. Over there in the

29:36.848 --> 29:46.096
non-military, you do pretty well as you want to the 
whole time, and nobody was particularly

29:36.848 --> 29:46.096
concerned to see that you stayed in your room. Now, 
the last year that I was housemama, We did have some

29:49.642 --> 29:58.883
requirements on staying in your room because that 
was part of my job is to check up on the boys and see

29:49.642 --> 29:58.883
that everybody was in by certain times. Would you 
say there was more or less harsh play in the

29:58.903 --> 30:03.955
non-military dorm than in the military?

30:06.905 --> 30:08.427
I would say there's a little less. Things as 
drowning out or things like that. You had a little

30:13.813 --> 30:23.826
of horseplay over in the non-military, but I don't 
believe quite as systematic or as well organized

30:13.813 --> 30:23.826
as you did in the military. Because the military, 
there's an incentive to do things in an orderly

30:24.306 --> 30:35.460
manner, and if you got in the habit of drowning 
somebody out pretty regularly, you just kept

30:24.306 --> 30:35.460
right at it.

30:43.793 --> 30:44.070
Thank you.
