WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:06.836
his economic philosophy, his politics, and what have you, much more so than me.

00:08.417 --> 00:20.248
Larry, with these five professors, in a Christmas party of all times, got me in the corner and said, you know, Mel, you've been an embarrassment to our college.

00:21.669 --> 00:22.310
I said, what do you mean?

00:22.350 --> 00:22.991
What have I done?

00:23.531 --> 00:25.973
He said, well, I understand you're rather outspoken.

00:26.053 --> 00:31.118
You thought Goldwater would be the best president we've ever had in this country.

00:31.283 --> 00:35.214
I said, I don't know if I went to that extreme, but I sure did want him, not LBJ.

00:36.437 --> 00:43.437
I don't think Johnson would be my type of president, but Goldwater, I think he was a solid man.

00:44.969 --> 00:57.464
Anyway, I got so teed off, not to use Hollywood expressions, I got so teed off at that thing that I was determined again, now I've already lost the Louisiana State job.

00:57.504 --> 01:03.991
They had offered me that and I said, no, I'm not going to stay here at Florida State.

01:04.332 --> 01:14.183
And my wife, therefore at this point, was somewhat amenable to a move, but not of all things to Texas and Texas A&M.

01:14.804 --> 01:24.440
So anyway, I'm sitting in front of Earl Rudder, and almost before he started talking to me, I'm staring at LBJ saying to myself, uh-oh, this is not my place.

01:26.142 --> 01:27.404
I'm a Goldwater man.

01:28.226 --> 01:33.514
And Earl Rudder, bless him, I love the man.

01:34.676 --> 01:39.023
He looked at me, are you a fan of LBJ?

01:39.728 --> 01:44.695
I don't know whether I called him General Rudder then, or President Rudder, or Mr. Rudder, or Earl even.

01:44.875 --> 01:47.900
I don't recall, but in my mind he's always been Earl.

01:49.362 --> 01:53.868
And I said, well frankly, let me be honest with you, I'm not fond of the man.

01:53.929 --> 01:58.395
I was very fond, and am still fond of cold water.

02:01.143 --> 02:03.553
I thought that was going to be the end of it.

02:03.573 --> 02:10.461
The next thing he starts telling me about A&M, he starts telling me about Larry Falwick, he starts telling me about his dreams for the university.

02:11.403 --> 02:17.768
And boy, I'm getting really, really excited now because apparently I don't have to genuflect the man.

02:18.429 --> 02:19.530
I don't have to be a phony.

02:19.970 --> 02:23.313
I don't have to make believe, oh yes, LBJ, isn't he wonderful?

02:23.834 --> 02:30.519
When Don, well I know, I don't think so, and I didn't like his great society talk and all of that for all of all.

02:30.699 --> 02:32.901
It just wasn't my form of economics.

02:35.724 --> 02:40.988
All of a sudden, I'm being dismissed to go back with Frank Hubert

02:42.098 --> 02:46.502
And my wife is outside because she had been invited to come.

02:47.323 --> 03:01.656
Now, you know, in the military, especially when you get up on that general level, and I never did get near that, but anyway, when you become general, you decide that your best command involves your top soldiers.

03:02.157 --> 03:10.705
And if you're top soldiers, if you're majors and you're like colonels and what have you, if these fellows are happily married to a real good woman,

03:11.512 --> 03:12.773
You've got a good command.

03:13.474 --> 03:16.077
So Earl wanted to interview Mari.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.122
Mari had never been interviewed in her life.

03:21.844 --> 03:28.792
I sort of took her out of a normal lifestyle when I married her, you know.

03:29.132 --> 03:36.881
And the next thing she knew, she's raising children and not worrying about jobs, and it was my problem to make sure we were eating.

03:38.083 --> 03:40.185
And all of a sudden she's being interviewed.

03:41.718 --> 03:48.986
Anyway the next day we're going back home and she said, well thank heaven we're not going to that place.

03:49.647 --> 03:50.407
I said, what do you mean?

03:50.708 --> 03:52.129
I think I'm going to take the job.

03:52.790 --> 03:55.293
Boy, did we have a battle on that one for a while.

03:55.573 --> 03:58.476
And this was going into Houston if I recall.

03:59.017 --> 04:03.121
We had to have maybe, that fellow used to drive people back and forth.

04:03.261 --> 04:05.023
I can't remember his name but I know who you're talking about.

04:05.283 --> 04:06.865
Sam something.

04:07.132 --> 04:12.702
Anyway, we're almost having a violin argument in the backseat, and she's letting me know no one's going to interview me.

04:13.123 --> 04:14.806
I said, honey, you were being honored.

04:14.846 --> 04:22.260
That man was trying to tell you he may have liked me, but he cared really what you were like.

04:22.801 --> 04:26.568
No one else has ever bothered you in any job I've ever taken.

04:26.588 --> 04:27.790
They never knew you.

04:28.225 --> 04:34.273
You didn't matter to, and I mentioned the other presidents of other universities that she later on knew.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.676
I said, this man was honoring you.

04:36.816 --> 04:42.242
He was trying to tell you how important you are to him because otherwise I'm not his man.

04:43.304 --> 04:48.150
Well, by the time we got back to Tallahassee, she mellowed a little bit, but never really.

04:48.530 --> 04:53.136
Did she indicate what topics he talked to her about?

04:54.432 --> 04:56.975
Gosh I could find out, you know she's with me in town.

04:58.517 --> 05:02.422
I think they, sort of what kind of children do you have?

05:02.462 --> 05:03.623
What church do you go to?

05:03.683 --> 05:07.108
And things like that, the normal type of conversation.

05:07.989 --> 05:19.283
I doubt that he, oh I think he asked do you enjoy music and she said yes, I was a flutist and I could have gone to Juilliard if not for Mel and so forth and stuff like that.

05:20.224 --> 05:21.305
What's Mel like?

05:21.325 --> 05:22.887
Oh he moves me too often.

05:24.419 --> 05:32.388
Did Mr. Rudder indicate why, I've often wondered, why economics and chemistry?

05:33.729 --> 05:40.957
Did he indicate why he became so interested in that department, in the economics department, to get it back going?

05:41.318 --> 05:48.866
I think he just wanted to get rid of Al, without mentioning the names of the other fellows in the department.

05:48.886 --> 05:52.570
Irv Ling was a dandy human being.

05:52.752 --> 06:07.459
But there were several in the department who were rather extremely liberal and much too, and there's profanity from one fellow that I don't, you know who I'm referring to, and stuff like that was going on.

06:07.519 --> 06:13.410
Plus, especially the Willie Nelson thing that apparently blew up way beyond its own importance.

06:13.390 --> 06:23.015
And so I think Earl was thinking he'd do anything to change the scene in econ.

06:23.036 --> 06:28.530
He didn't indicate that he had any special source of funding specifically for economics, did he?

06:29.894 --> 06:35.321
Whatever he had, I'll tell you the deal I got in a second.

06:36.122 --> 06:40.928
I think Larry Forwick was also a catalyst here, a big one.

06:41.209 --> 06:53.424
In other words, in retrospect, and of course we're speaking of a man who was long deceased, but I think he really wanted to see the economics department change.

06:53.945 --> 06:58.551
Part of the mandate I got, get rid of everyone except

06:59.982 --> 07:06.129
a couple, namely Al Chalker of Langham, and basically I'll back you."

07:07.770 --> 07:09.052
And he said, what would you need?

07:09.312 --> 07:11.654
I'll go into this and maybe I'll be answering you.

07:12.275 --> 07:19.843
I told him one of the greatest shortcomings I've always had in my life, outside of the dissertation years, my wife did most of my typing.

07:20.604 --> 07:23.627
I'm not a typist, I don't want to even look at a typewriter.

07:24.333 --> 07:35.205
I write longhand and C-types and then I erase and so forth or eradicate, and that's the way I work, and I never had enough secretarial support.

07:35.225 --> 07:37.147
I ended up with an unbelievable contract.

07:38.469 --> 07:42.994
Ten secretaries for ten faculty, and I'm rolling over seven or eight of the faculty.

07:43.534 --> 07:50.442
Within two years' time, they were all gone outside of Ervlinger, Al Chalk.

07:53.020 --> 07:55.746
The fellow who was quite a good athlete.

07:56.147 --> 07:58.632
Oh, you will remember him.

07:58.672 --> 07:59.534
What is his name?

08:02.119 --> 08:07.370
Oh, I'll think of it later, but Marie Chalk would remember.

08:10.096 --> 08:11.399
He was quite a track star.

08:11.459 --> 08:12.902
He loved sports.

08:14.266 --> 08:15.027
Doesn't ring a bell.

08:15.468 --> 08:29.293
Anyway, but there was one other fellow that I knew I wasn't supposed to necessarily do anything about, and I didn't like the idea of chopping heads except I knew the other fellows in economics, and they were not my type.

08:29.313 --> 08:34.502
They weren't going to be publishing, and the name of the game was to publish or perish.

08:35.967 --> 08:50.272
because Earl did want A&M to be as outstanding as possible, and I guess Larry Farr could convince him that, by gosh, maybe someone like me could do it, and Earl was determined he was going to do things there.

08:51.153 --> 08:57.945
So I was told I could have ten secretaries, and I also mentioned to him, I want to fly first class.

08:58.025 --> 09:01.671
I'm tired of going back and forth in tourist class.

09:01.651 --> 09:03.554
Okay, you could fly first class.

09:03.794 --> 09:04.696
What's my salary?

09:05.537 --> 09:12.087
He fixed it frankly, and I'm mentioning it, at $25,000, which I thought was pretty good.

09:12.168 --> 09:18.998
I forget what I was getting in Florida State at the time, something like $17,000, $18,000 or so, so it was a good boost.

09:19.018 --> 09:23.305
And I thought, boy, now finally I'm getting out of those depression years.

09:23.673 --> 09:26.059
And pretty happy at the thought.

09:26.159 --> 09:36.806
Meanwhile, a baseball player, a great baseball player, Brooks Robinson, playing third base for the Baltimore Orioles, signed a contract at 50.

09:37.568 --> 09:39.994
And I thought to myself, well, you know,

09:40.801 --> 09:43.886
If he's getting twice as much as me, that's not too bad.

09:44.286 --> 09:57.727
I'm being well paid because by gosh I've got a long future as a professor, and poor Brooks Robinson, my gosh, he's maybe got another three, four years and then he's got to find a new livelihood.

09:57.808 --> 09:59.991
I don't mind his getting twice as much.

10:00.781 --> 10:04.006
Put it more positively, get one half as much as he's getting.

10:04.527 --> 10:09.034
I've got a pretty good job going there at A&M, plus fly first class.

10:10.336 --> 10:11.458
Of course, a lot of challenge.

10:12.099 --> 10:14.422
Get rid of a lot of guys and do it nicely.

10:15.063 --> 10:24.458
I found the seven or eight fellas that I replaced, I found just about each one of them a job that suited them, that they wanted, that they took.

10:25.039 --> 10:27.683
In other words, I found it part of my job.

10:27.663 --> 10:31.017
to get rid of them in effect, but to get them good jobs.

10:32.343 --> 10:36.762
So that when they left, they left amicably and in fact would say, gee whiz,

10:37.180 --> 10:44.589
We've been treated well by A&M, and that was, in effect, the general parameters of the job.

10:44.609 --> 10:51.998
In those important discussions and decisions, who was the vice president of academic affairs?

10:52.078 --> 10:54.100
Was Wayne Hall still the vice president?

10:54.160 --> 10:55.462
Wayne Hall, and he was excellent.

10:56.843 --> 10:59.847
Describe any role he played in these discussions.

11:00.991 --> 11:12.722
Well he gave me a lot of fill in and guaranteed me that I was going to get this sort of backing and that what they wanted in exchange was no embarrassment.

11:13.124 --> 11:17.590
No profanity in classrooms and stuff that I completely subscribe to.

11:17.630 --> 11:27.342
In fact at the hosting that the Department of Econ and others had for me about six, seven years ago, who was it?

11:27.722 --> 11:39.537
John Allen, who I groomed in a sense to replace me because I didn't intend to hold on as department head for too many years, but I wanted to do what I told him I would do and build it.

11:39.803 --> 11:43.869
And at this stage of the game, I did have good contacts in the profession.

11:44.991 --> 12:02.318
Anyway, John Allen mentioned something I had long forgotten, that I told every faculty member that we hired in the years subsequent to my joining here that they'd have to wear coat and tie and no profanity allowed in any classroom.

12:04.137 --> 12:09.665
And John said, that made me one of those Grecian type of messengers.

12:10.406 --> 12:17.797
No one liked me because I was giving all the dirty news that Mel was telling me we had to enforce.

12:18.698 --> 12:21.903
Was the doctoral program already available?

12:22.143 --> 12:22.464
No.

12:22.945 --> 12:25.869
We had a wonderful undergraduate teaching.

12:25.929 --> 12:32.018
These fellows who we replaced apparently were really outstanding teachers.

12:32.656 --> 12:51.335
and here too memory now has faded from my mind, one of the fellows years later who had studied under Al back in the days and loved Al so much, organized former classmates into putting up a fund for Al Chalk scholarships and so forth, and the teaching was really outstanding.

12:51.555 --> 12:59.203
And the enrollment, and you probably recall, in economics among undergraduate majors was outstanding.

12:59.707 --> 13:06.541
But we only had two fellas, as far as I recall, with PhDs in the department, Al Chalk and Herb Linger.

13:06.561 --> 13:07.603
All the rest were massive.

13:07.663 --> 13:11.931
No, Alan Pulsiver may have had a PhD.

13:12.112 --> 13:15.859
I believe there were three of them.

13:16.717 --> 13:22.784
He was a pretty good fellow, but maybe a little more liberal and desired and what have you.

13:23.565 --> 13:26.968
And anyway, I'm sorry I may have lost your question.

13:28.770 --> 13:29.712
The doctoral program.

13:30.072 --> 13:30.593
Yeah.

13:31.313 --> 13:33.956
Did anybody promise that it would come about?

13:34.217 --> 13:40.103
Oh, that was part of the dealings, chiefly with Wayne Hall, I suspect.

13:40.163 --> 13:41.745
I don't recall in detail.

13:42.181 --> 13:52.179
But of course if I'm coming here to make a good department, not a good department, I wanted to be in a top department, sort of like Penn State, Michigan State.

13:53.281 --> 13:58.992
Florida State was, gosh, we had prospects over one other thing that was going wrong with Florida State.

13:58.972 --> 14:18.938
Two friends of mine, Jim Buchanan, who had already been at Florida State and had left, and not only Jim Buchanan, but Charles Ferguson, who I had known because I had written articles with his senior advisor when he was writing his dissertation.

14:18.918 --> 14:32.383
Charlie Ferguson and Jim Buchanan wanted to go to Florida State, and our department head and dean at Florida State at the time thought it would be too difficult to work enough money for those two fellows to go to Florida State.

14:33.205 --> 14:42.242
And they would have added to our department at Florida State the necessary extras that would have made Florida State's Econ Department top quality.

14:44.804 --> 14:49.971
So among other things, I've always wanted to be with the top quality department, but for reasons.

14:51.689 --> 14:57.335
of constraint in universities in the South that weren't creating great departments.

14:57.875 --> 15:18.996
So part of my ambition was to be associated with top-quality economists, and part of the arrangement with Wayne Hall and, in effect, basically Earl, was to not only change the department upside down by getting rid of, in effect, the fellows who did not have doctorates,

15:18.976 --> 15:30.806
and did not have academic success in the Harvard-Yale sense of the term, ability, and to replace them.

15:31.067 --> 15:34.656
But to replace them, you'd have to have a PhD program going.

15:34.636 --> 15:57.291
Because any time you're going out for Charlie Ferguson, who we did get, Jim Buchanan, who still didn't come, he went out to UCLA at that point, Tom Saving, others of that kind, Bob Baseman, to get men of that caliber down here at A&M, we had to have a doctoral program because they wanted to deal chiefly with grad students.

15:57.452 --> 15:59.715
And that was, as you know, the name of the game.

15:59.695 --> 16:02.862
You publish back then especially, or you perish.

16:03.343 --> 16:05.167
You want good money, you publish.

16:05.728 --> 16:07.572
You publish, you want grad students.

16:08.334 --> 16:12.102
You want grad students, you want great grad students.

16:12.583 --> 16:16.371
It's all tied up, and this is, of course, Wayne Hall knew it well.

16:17.667 --> 16:31.061
Earl Rudder I don't think knew it, but Earl Rudder knew Larry Faureka, and some people were advising him, and he also had an instinct, I'm sure he had to, to have a Wayne Hall and subsequently a Mac Prescott.

16:31.081 --> 16:34.564
Well, I think Mac was probably after Earl had died.

16:35.545 --> 16:42.392
But in any event, every decision I ever saw coming out of Earl Rudder was the right one from my standpoint.

16:42.372 --> 16:51.669
If anything, if he did anything that was not wonderful, it was that he micromanaged too much.

16:52.591 --> 16:59.885
But when he had trust in someone, from what I could tell, boy, he gave them a car planche and he gave me a car planche.

17:00.846 --> 17:04.954
We had parties in our house where Earl literally helped me bartend.

17:06.436 --> 17:11.722
And one of the fellows who we brought in here, who was it?

17:11.762 --> 17:15.767
I think Chuck Maurice mentioned he, oh no, it was John Atwood.

17:15.787 --> 17:16.948
Well, they're at each of them.

17:16.988 --> 17:18.710
They have all the same type of stories.

17:19.130 --> 17:34.688
They were flawed by the fact when they came to my house, I typically, especially if I had enough that I was recruiting at the time, we'd have a party and we'd have a member of the Board of Regents, maybe a John Lindsay was here with Earl Rutter and others.

17:35.242 --> 17:50.443
And John Allen, I believe, was the one who mentioned that he was so flabbergasted by the people that were at the house there, interested in whether he was moving to A&M that he thought, my gosh, and he was en route to California for another interview.

17:50.563 --> 17:53.687
He canceled and decided he's going to A&M.

17:56.050 --> 17:58.093
Earl Leather was dedicated to

18:00.436 --> 18:04.443
building as great a university as he could and as fast as he could.

18:04.603 --> 18:10.793
I think part of the push behind him was his own natural push, his love for A&M.

18:11.554 --> 18:22.292
I also imagine, and I did write this in that autobiography that became a biography recently, in some respects

18:23.977 --> 18:28.925
I think what happened with Earl, he loved A&M when he was a youngster here.

18:29.305 --> 18:32.130
He believed in it just like you and I have.

18:32.991 --> 18:35.555
The students are unique at A&M.

18:35.575 --> 18:49.917
I think one of the greatest advantages we have now are our students, more so than our faculty, not that our faculty isn't top quality, but our faculty in many ways is getting too PC?

18:50.538 --> 18:51.299
May I say it?

18:52.981 --> 18:59.889
They're not as willing as maybe they used to be to be unique and incorrect from the standpoint of academia.

19:00.690 --> 19:15.308
But Earl, I imagine, found that even though the students were great, the reputation of A&M was not at the same level that he had imagined it might be because we were not a published parish university as such.

19:16.169 --> 19:18.672
We're a university with wonderful people.

19:20.288 --> 19:44.870
Not that you can't have wonderful published people also, I like to believe I am, but in any way, somehow, Earl would have bought the idea that economics was an area that he could build upon and move as fast as possible, and obviously, Larry Faurek led him to believe that I might be the type who would do it, and he sure gave me all the backing.

19:45.230 --> 19:50.295
If I didn't have that backing, nothing could have happened, and I had a hundred percent backing.

19:50.275 --> 20:03.011
Was there any request or proposal that you made as a part of your move over here that... Ten secretaries, first class... No, no, was there anything that wasn't accepted?

20:04.654 --> 20:05.755
Not that I can recall.

20:06.276 --> 20:06.416
Okay.

20:06.436 --> 20:18.932
No, he... I got along with Irv Wattersoe naturally, and then after I convinced my wife that she was being honored, I sort of think she thought, well, boy, maybe this is... Oh, and I had to promise my wife...

20:19.503 --> 20:27.174
something that I had refused ever to do, and that is go on a retirement program to be paid for by the state.

20:27.535 --> 20:43.999
I like the old LORP, where I could pack up in two days' time and go to that other place, that other job, and not worry about the fact that my pension was not vested in the state.

20:44.179 --> 20:45.461
Well, I agreed with Maui.

20:45.902 --> 20:48.025
I said, honey, if we move here to A&M,

20:48.410 --> 20:51.093
I'll go on TRS, which means sweetheart.

20:51.494 --> 20:52.675
I'm now getting up in age.

20:52.695 --> 20:57.481
I was in my early forties at the time, and you're almost in your forties, honey.

20:57.561 --> 21:16.763
I'm not going to forget that someday we're going to have to retire, and if I go to A&M and pull my normal trick and three or four years from now we're off elsewhere and then maybe we even go back, I've got to put in ten years at A&M, otherwise all of a sudden we're not going to have any retirement to look into.

21:17.131 --> 21:26.234
So I promised her I would not go ORP, I would go TRS, and that means I'm literally guaranteeing you ten years before I consider leaving.

21:26.876 --> 21:31.528
Oddly enough, in three years, we had succeeded so much in building the department

21:32.234 --> 21:37.162
I've been contacted by Auburn to see if I was interested in being president there, and I immediately said no.

21:38.023 --> 21:39.245
Meanwhile, guess what?

21:39.746 --> 21:42.671
Bill Ross at LSU says, we've got a bell chair for you.

21:42.691 --> 21:43.472
It's wonderful.

21:44.794 --> 21:53.128
Apparently, the chancellor of Louisiana State was a friend of Earl Ruddard's, and he

21:54.290 --> 22:01.817
had heard of the building in economics at A&M, and Earl Wetter called me to his office.

22:01.937 --> 22:06.160
This is a few years later, I'm taking you off of the earlier day.

22:07.361 --> 22:14.288
And Earl had me in his office, and he said, I understand you're negotiating with Louisiana State.

22:15.429 --> 22:17.650
I said, well I don't know, how did you hear that?

22:18.531 --> 22:23.976
I don't know if I'm negotiating, I did negotiate years ago and turned it down, and I do know that

22:24.277 --> 22:30.644
I've been contacted, would I be interested in a bell chair?"

22:30.785 --> 22:33.047
But how did you know that, Mr. Rudder?

22:33.888 --> 22:48.165
Well, so-and-so was a dear friend of mine and he called me and asked me if I would mind greatly if they gave you the offer that he's been asked to give me, to give you, you know, you, Mel.

22:49.006 --> 22:50.908
And I said, well, if

22:52.424 --> 22:56.991
You want to, go ahead and give them the offer, but I'm going to try to stop them."

22:57.011 --> 23:01.057
And at which point, this is in 1969, I'd been department head for three years.

23:02.379 --> 23:06.625
One of the first things we did when I came here was to set up the PhD program.

23:07.165 --> 23:09.589
I think that went through Jack Williams.

23:10.008 --> 23:12.271
group in Austin at the time.

23:13.093 --> 23:13.994
It went fast.

23:15.736 --> 23:19.923
I also began a negotiation with the National Science Foundation.

23:20.143 --> 23:27.995
The guy I wanted to replace me was then the head of the econ section at NSF and an old-time friend of mine from North Carolina.

23:29.276 --> 23:34.204
We picked up, we knew we were going to get a big grant, which we did, about a million dollars.

23:34.544 --> 23:39.812
Around 1950, I think, we got the money.

23:42.425 --> 23:47.600
So, backtrack to LSU, Earl Rudder said, I hope you're not going to leave.

23:48.743 --> 23:49.545
Don't you like it here?

23:49.565 --> 23:53.115
I said, Mr. Rudder, you've been fantastic.

23:53.135 --> 23:54.780
Everyone has been fantastic.

23:55.503 --> 24:00.810
Off the record, even Andy Suttle, fantastic.

24:02.513 --> 24:17.093
But I must admit, I'm doing this administrative work only because I wanted to be in a top flight department, and we've got a top flight department now, but now I want to go back and try to do more writing.

24:17.153 --> 24:20.397
I've got an outside dream that I might someday get a Nobel.

24:21.676 --> 24:26.892
or whatever, and my ambition is really to be a great economist.

24:26.952 --> 24:28.035
I've had fun.

24:28.356 --> 24:34.133
We've done, obviously, more than you expected and even more than I expected.

24:34.838 --> 24:48.233
And if LSU does offer me what they're going to offer me, that I've got an idea, I suspect I might take it, but then I have to argue with my wife and admit that we've lost another retirement because I'm stuck with the state of Texas.

24:48.913 --> 24:57.743
And if I move in three, four years, and this was the end of the third year that this is going on, I've thrown down three more years of my life, but gee whiz, I might.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.745
Though I don't want to leave, frankly.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.067
Well, what do you want?

25:01.627 --> 25:02.128
I told them.

25:03.560 --> 25:12.553
He gave me everything I wanted as a professor, and all of those alumni professorships have fallen, and money, and deal.

25:13.634 --> 25:15.337
So I turned the job over.

25:15.717 --> 25:20.844
But now I've taken you out of the context you had me going in on the negotiation with Earl.

25:21.425 --> 25:22.747
All right, you mentioned Suttle.

25:23.228 --> 25:25.671
Was Andy Suttle here when you got here?

25:25.711 --> 25:29.316
What role did he play in the recruitment, if any?

25:29.336 --> 25:31.980
I think Andy was tied up with the Welsh Foundation.

25:33.175 --> 25:41.110
And I believe President Rudder thought that Andy was a catalyst for a lot of future money for A&M.

25:42.252 --> 25:55.757
And at this stage of the game I think President Rudder knew that money was a big factor, or it was the factor, if he's going to convert A&M into

25:56.328 --> 26:05.216
Unfortunately, very academically respectable, and at times when I look at some of these other places like Harvard and what have you, I don't know if I wanted us to be that academically acceptable.

26:06.357 --> 26:09.200
Now, but was Suttle already here when... Suttle was here.

26:09.500 --> 26:13.544
Was he one of the people that met with you to perhaps... No.

26:13.824 --> 26:17.808
No, I didn't meet him until after I was here.

26:17.828 --> 26:17.928
Okay.

26:17.948 --> 26:22.993
What was his role after you got here in helping the department?

26:25.083 --> 26:29.668
I think he knew that the President would have wanted to back this department.

26:29.688 --> 26:33.612
I don't think Andy liked me too much and I didn't like him too much.

26:33.772 --> 26:35.854
Did he get in the way of anything?

26:36.254 --> 26:36.314
No.

26:36.334 --> 26:37.476
He never got in the way.

26:37.516 --> 26:38.977
Frank Hubert got in the way once.

26:39.638 --> 26:41.420
Can you share how?

26:41.460 --> 26:42.040
Frank, yes.

26:43.161 --> 26:45.404
I'm wheeling and dealing with fellas I knew.

26:47.466 --> 26:51.630
Jim Blackman, who got an O'Dell subsequently but did not go to A&M.

26:52.235 --> 26:57.300
Charles Ferguson, who we got, Tom Saving, who we got, Bob Baseman, who we got.

26:58.301 --> 27:16.420
Anyway, another fellow who was a Texan, and I was picking on fellows who I knew would not be biased against an all men's university, which was now becoming coeducational, but still not that, and Traut was frankly at my university, Washington University,

27:17.024 --> 27:27.403
And I'm chatting with Trout, and he said, well, I've heard that what you say you've produced, and if you could produce what you and I are talking about, I'll join you.

27:28.164 --> 27:33.775
I said, well, tell me exactly what you would demand of us, and I'll let you know exactly if I can do it.

27:34.376 --> 27:36.039
And if I cannot do it, you don't come.

27:36.219 --> 27:37.241
If I do it, you come.

27:38.143 --> 27:39.505
We laid it out cold.

27:41.071 --> 28:02.404
And that's the way I dealt with Bob Baseman, with Tom Saving, with everyone, because I figured that regardless of subtle, who from time to time would chop pay increases or have some impact that way, on those who I'm recruiting, I never had anything that didn't come out exactly the way I told Fergie or Tom Saving, what have you.

28:02.975 --> 28:14.229
Anyway, guess of all times, I guess Frank Hubit got a little tired of it, and he refused to back the offer that I had told Trout Raider he could expect.

28:15.511 --> 28:18.374
So I told Frank, I said, this man's going to turn me down.

28:19.035 --> 28:20.096
He's going to turn us down.

28:20.236 --> 28:20.777
We need him.

28:21.478 --> 28:25.763
His field of expertise in economics was one area that we were still weak at.

28:26.344 --> 28:28.847
And by the way, within three years' time, we were rated in the

28:29.401 --> 28:33.968
The American Economic Review is about the 19th best department of economics in the country.

28:34.889 --> 28:39.877
That's like starting football one year and two years later you're playing against Notre Dame and beating them.

28:41.599 --> 28:44.484
Anyway, I said, I'm going to lose this man.

28:44.744 --> 28:46.046
He said, no you won't.

28:46.066 --> 28:47.929
Sure enough, I sent the offer.

28:47.949 --> 28:53.497
Sure enough, the word came back, Mel, I told you what I wanted.

28:53.537 --> 28:54.479
You said I would get it.

28:54.919 --> 28:56.402
Now you tell me I can't have it.

28:56.662 --> 28:58.024
The answer is I'm not coming.

28:59.168 --> 29:01.232
I showed a letter to Frank Hubert.

29:01.253 --> 29:03.738
Frank said, oh, I'd offer him summer income.

29:04.680 --> 29:09.470
I offered him much more money, in effect, than the basic offer was to me.

29:10.292 --> 29:11.074
He turned it down.

29:11.836 --> 29:13.920
That was the only time I had trouble with Frank Hubert.

29:15.520 --> 29:29.954
And maybe the only logic of that story is if you know your profession, and you know this better than I do, Haskell, from your experience as a president of your university, if people have faith and trust in you, they're going to want to join you.

29:30.754 --> 29:38.962
But if they think that, oh, he says one thing, but he's not going to produce many of these things, you've got a tough job on your hands.

29:38.982 --> 29:40.323
You're not going to succeed too well.

29:41.545 --> 29:44.127
And at that point,

29:45.102 --> 29:50.169
We had succeeded so beautifully, the world and the country got upside down.

29:51.030 --> 30:01.385
They had Charlie Ferguson drawing more money than baseball players were back then, and Charlie just got what he deserved, frankly, and he was a wonderful asset to all.

30:01.946 --> 30:11.920
Now, when you got here, did you have some other economics program, some other institution that was your model you were hoping to do what

30:13.250 --> 30:16.915
No, you know, a lot of people would say we were probably emulating the U of Chicago.

30:17.596 --> 30:18.437
Quite the opposite.

30:19.339 --> 30:23.384
Most of my publications were coming out of the opposite camp, the Harvard School.

30:24.085 --> 30:33.919
Harvard was a liberal group, and I wasn't a liberal economist, but my economics was always maverick vis-à-vis Chicago.

30:34.140 --> 30:40.168
Chicago economics was always monetary theory and stuff like that.

30:40.148 --> 30:47.407
And I was going on my own tangent based on a dissertation that gave me the idea of economic space.

30:48.229 --> 30:51.458
So I was sort of a maverick in that respect.

30:52.163 --> 31:01.816
And I had, even though most of the men that I hired were conservatives politically, I deliberately went out of my way to get non-conservatives.

31:02.437 --> 31:17.277
I hired a couple of fellows, I don't know if I should mention them, Bert Bowden, and, gee, another fellow's name is escaping me, but I deliberately hired some fellows who would be regarded as rather liberal.

31:18.320 --> 31:22.304
Now your first, who was your first big hire?

31:24.106 --> 31:24.967
First big hire.

31:25.167 --> 31:25.587
What was that?

31:25.607 --> 31:26.709
They came and clustered.

31:28.290 --> 31:28.731
Who was that?

31:28.751 --> 31:31.754
I would say Charlie Ferguson and Tom Saving were the biggest names.

31:31.894 --> 31:43.686
Eric Fuhrer-Botten, a real big name, and subsequently Bob Baseman, who in his field of econometrics was at that stage of the game
