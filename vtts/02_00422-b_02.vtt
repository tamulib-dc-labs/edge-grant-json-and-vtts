WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:06.054
This is very capable, dynamic personality. How 
did he treat his men? Well, there's some people in

00:10.718 --> 00:15.584
Texas that thought he didn't treat us very well. 
That was at the Rapido River. And that's on up the

00:19.308 --> 00:21.850
way, you know, to Salerno. Because they thought 
that his order across the Rapido River was an

00:22.811 --> 00:31.000
ill-conceived plan. Of course, he was the Army 
commander. There's a Corps commander between

00:33.132 --> 00:34.735
him. And how much the Corps commander is 
responsible for, it's nothing. But it's easy when

00:40.003 --> 00:45.471
he was unsuccessful to say it wasn't a very good 
plan. MacArthur's plan, going an inch on it,

00:47.374 --> 00:50.258
wasn't a very good plan either. But he was highly 
successful. So he becomes a brilliant

00:51.680 --> 00:58.771
individual.

00:58.791 --> 00:59.873
And I'd say Clark was brilliant. popular with the 
troops. Of course, it's long distance from an Army

01:02.499 --> 01:05.603
commander and a troop. They'll only see who's out 
and landed in that plane, and they say, well,

01:05.623 --> 01:11.551
that's General Clark, or if he's out in the 
formation. Like where I got to keep in the Silver

01:12.092 --> 01:16.878
Storm, me, the entire division was in formation. 
We were out of the lines. But they were way back, and

01:18.580 --> 01:26.691
we all marched up, you know, lined up in front.

01:26.711 --> 01:29.134
But as we went up the Rapido River,

01:32.793 --> 01:47.612
What made that so questionable was that

01:32.793 --> 01:47.612
it wasn't a surprise night attack, because they 
had already been probing along the way. And

01:49.595 --> 01:57.545
instead of making a frontal attack across the 
river in the valley, we would do the way I would

01:49.595 --> 01:57.545
teach it. You would say it's best to take the high 
ground. and then come back behind rather than

02:03.083 --> 02:12.036
trying to frontally attack, assault, fortified 
positions. But now why did he do it? Because we had

02:14.059 --> 02:18.205
the first armored division in Italy. And people 
said, well, why do you have an armored division in

02:18.225 --> 02:21.610
the mountains of Italy? Well, somebody's got to 
answer that question. They say, well, there's

02:24.293 --> 02:32.365
some broad valleys in Italy that you can let armor 
go right on up there and overrun, get on up to Rome to

02:24.293 --> 02:32.365
get this thing over with. So they weren't looking 
for high ground to penetrate. They were looking

02:36.477 --> 02:43.042
for level ground to utilize the armor. So that was 
the reason why we attacked down there where we did.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.529
It had heavy casualties. And it was ordered to 
attack again. This is daytime now. Actually, it

02:55.293 --> 02:56.994
was unsuccessful on the first time. They attacked 
again. They had even more heavy casualties. Then

03:00.457 --> 03:02.959
they ordered to attack the third time. And I said, 
we just don't have the people. We've lost leaders,

03:07.881 --> 03:17.151
and we've got wounded hanging on the wire on the 
other side, calling for help, you know, many. So I

03:17.171 --> 03:18.633
decided not to attack. Well, there was so many 
Texans in the 36th Division, you know, they

03:19.834 --> 03:24.499
immediately went after Clark's scout. And they 
got politics involved with it here. And it cost

03:28.002 --> 03:29.924
him. He never did. He wasn't selected as chief of 
staff. or the Army, which he thought he was going to

03:33.601 --> 03:38.128
be because of that Rapido River. I think it's a 
little unfair to Clark as a Corps commander,

03:38.148 --> 03:47.644
maybe,

03:38.148 --> 03:47.644
but it was unfortunate. And the thing about the 
36th, that was the second, see, first for the

03:49.327 --> 03:54.676
battalion. The rest of the division didn't suffer 
so much in here. in Salerno, but here you had the

04:00.061 --> 04:02.244
division. It really took a beating on that. Would 
you say that at Rapido there was almost a mutiny

04:06.329 --> 04:13.157
from the American troops? Well, they said they 
weren't going to attack a third time. No, the

04:17.142 --> 04:20.266
leaders said that. So the leaders said that we just 
don't have, in general, we just don't have the

04:20.286 --> 04:27.434
troops to continue this. That's right. So that 
leader was relieved. Oh, was he? Yeah. That's

04:33.496 --> 04:40.863
Colonel Martin, the one that welcomed me on the 
train with open arms. But wasn't he just telling

04:43.365 --> 04:44.826
the truth? Yeah, but then they tried to 
investigate it and said that

04:46.728 --> 04:56.697
lack of leadership because of the negative 
attitude You know, if you start sympathizing with

04:58.685 --> 05:07.357
the troops and telling how bad it is, and you're one 
who should know, they'll say, boy, that's right.

05:09.260 --> 05:12.084
But if you say, you may say, well, that's not being 
truthful. You may say, well, things are not as bad

05:12.825 --> 05:15.890
as you think they are.

05:20.877 --> 05:26.565
Because it's just like, I often think, back there 
was a baseball umpire I can't call his name now.

05:32.119 --> 05:35.883
He's written a lot of books, too. And he says, his 
picture's through this ball, you know. And one

05:40.308 --> 05:46.375
says it's the ball, and the other says it's a 
strike, you know, depending on which team he's

05:40.308 --> 05:46.375
supporting. And he says, there ain't nothing till 
I call it. And that's right. It's a missile through

05:49.518 --> 05:55.725
the air until he puts a name, nomenclature on it. 
And it's only a stripe because he said so or not. And

05:59.421 --> 06:06.449
they said, well, if you don't believe you're out, 
he said, read the morning's paper and you'll find

05:59.421 --> 06:06.449
out the statistics of the game that you're out. In 
many situations, particularly in combat, it can

06:09.112 --> 06:14.498
be worse than you think it is. It can not be near as 
bad. But you tend to perceive it in different ways,

06:16.580 --> 06:24.328
you know. Now, the role of a leader is to keep a cool 
head, and you'll find that you're not near as bad as

06:25.996 --> 06:36.366
you think it is, or you perceive it to be, or it 
appears to be. And I think that's the difference

06:38.188 --> 06:43.473
between a successful and an unsuccessful. Now, 
we'll go through this whole entire narrative, but

06:43.493 --> 06:47.497
of course you're not going through a whole World 
War II. But we've actually had leaders. I had one to

06:52.902 --> 06:55.885
me, the finest officer that I think that... And 
this was another battle after Rapido, which I was

06:56.692 --> 07:12.527
gnawed on in this next one coming up at Monte 
Cassino.

07:12.547 --> 07:15.630
I was a... Why don't you just spread that out? Well, 
after Rapido... Oh, by the way, the same time we

07:15.650 --> 07:24.538
attacked Rapido to get the Army Division across, 
The 24th Division attacked the high ground above

07:25.497 --> 07:37.472
Cassino, above Monte Cassino, and they were 
successful. So, but they didn't have any troops

07:37.492 --> 07:45.282
now to exploit that because they were attacked 
down below and up there, and they only had the two

07:37.492 --> 07:45.282
divisions, couldn't get these others. If there 
had been a feint down here, and then you put the

07:46.183 --> 07:53.732
whole thing through, you know, in the back, and 
then you go on back behind, And then you could

07:54.472 --> 07:55.934
attack and it was uncovered. In fact, you'd have 
them pinned. They'd have to pull back. Now it's

07:57.816 --> 08:01.319
true that you go back and that's hindsight.

08:04.062 --> 08:07.826
So 24th was successful, but nothing to do to 
exploit. They didn't have sufficient forces then

08:07.886 --> 08:12.391
to continue on because they got down weak. They'd 
get chewed up also. But we could have taken Cassina

08:14.553 --> 08:19.078
from the rear at the beginning. But then we really 
had heavy carriers. They had heavy carriers. Now

08:22.708 --> 08:24.950
you've got two divisions decimated. The third has 
been in combat. They're just out trying to get

08:26.612 --> 08:28.374
refitted. And that's the core right there of the 
three divisions. So after this one, pulled out of

08:31.979 --> 08:47.918
the line, got replacement, trained, and

08:31.979 --> 08:47.918
then

08:31.979 --> 08:47.918
we took what we had left. of your men at Rapido. 
Yeah. And we replaced the 24th Division up on the

08:52.252 --> 08:59.522
mountain.

09:01.084 --> 09:02.205
I had the battalion in. I was a major of what was left 
of the battalion.

09:08.834 --> 09:11.117
By the way, we had a truce with the Germans. I told 
you earlier how the Germans cooperated on

09:15.995 --> 09:21.842
relieving the poor, tired Americans and those 
guards to get their people back and say, if you can

09:15.995 --> 09:21.842
do that while we're fighting each other. At the 
Rapido, we had a truce. We asked for it. Chaplain

09:29.091 --> 09:33.416
went down, got permission from the division, 
division headquarters. So we went down with the

09:33.456 --> 09:35.118
truce. I went down there with them. And the Germans 
permitted us to get the wounded off of the wire

09:39.404 --> 09:44.550
across the river Okay, they bring him back, yeah. 
And it was a one-hour truce. And it was arranged by

09:52.851 --> 09:57.457
map on grid square. You know, at this time there 
would be no gunfire whatsoever on the grid square.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.006
And they abided by it, and we abided by it. So you 
went down and picked your soldiers out? Yeah. You

10:09.331 --> 10:10.452
sent the medics in? Yeah. I personally didn't go. I 
was on the river. Were they pretty beat up? Oh, the

10:16.205 --> 10:17.327
men had wounds? Yeah, oh, some had terrible 
wounds. Others had life wounds. Some of them were

10:20.632 --> 10:22.334
hanging in the wire. That's what was difficult. So 
they had buckets. The fortifications were

10:26.781 --> 10:28.243
beautiful. The river's not very large, wide. It 
was deep because it's rapid at that time of the

10:31.468 --> 10:34.172
year. But the Germans had a sunken road hundreds of 
years behind, parallel to the river. The Germans

10:42.364 --> 10:44.507
had a tunnel from the sunken road into the, not 
underwater, but to the bank. And they put their

10:49.959 --> 10:53.364
machine guns all the way down the river. And then 
they had them the other way, coming this way,

10:53.384 --> 10:56.889
interlaced, you know, with fire. So the poorer 
devils who were attacking, you aren't attacking

10:57.450 --> 11:01.756
the gun, it's killing you at all. You don't even see 
it, all you know, you're getting hit. And then they

11:05.121 --> 11:12.110
had barbed wire and mines, in other words, it was 
fortified, to rip up the fence. And this is what, we

11:12.130 --> 11:15.355
got across, we got across with a, bridges, foot 
bridges. So you could get across. You know, a lot of

11:20.422 --> 11:26.350
people got wounded trying to get the bridge 
installed and also cross it. But that's the reason

11:26.370 --> 11:28.773
why there were people there on the wire. They 
couldn't go far and they couldn't go back. And the

11:31.537 --> 11:35.442
Germans weren't going to get out of their 
fortification to get them out. So they agreed to

11:35.462 --> 11:38.506
it. How did you even contact them? They did it by 
radio.

11:44.774 --> 11:45.595
And a German... came and talked to me in 
well-dressed. He came to talk to you? Yeah, in

11:52.320 --> 11:54.342
English. He said, and he was telling the truth, he 
said, you lads certainly don't conduct river

11:54.362 --> 12:06.719
crossings like I was taught at Leavenworth. 
That's what he said to you? Yeah, he and our

12:08.281 --> 12:10.444
commanding staff called him Leavenworth. Here he 
was all clean and, you know, perky little cap on

12:10.464 --> 12:14.029
and... standing there with clean-shined boots 
and flipping his swagger stick. And what rank was

12:19.582 --> 12:22.366
he? I don't remember. I think he was a captain or 
maybe a major. I think he wasn't hiring the Lord.

12:28.495 --> 12:34.764
And so you got a hold of these people on the radio, 
and then you said, well, meet you, let's talk about

12:28.495 --> 12:34.764
this. Yeah, I personally didn't have anything to 
do with the troop except to participate in it,

12:34.784 --> 12:40.473
being down there on the river. I didn't talk. I 
don't know how the chaplain, how he arranged it,

12:42.106 --> 12:46.673
but some way that they had it with the Germans. And 
there I was. But that's what the German said to you?

12:52.643 --> 12:52.723
Huh? But that's what the German said to you when he 
came over to discuss his troops? Yeah. He, too, was

12:57.570 --> 12:59.994
just observing like I was, you know. Of course, he 
wanted to come on our side because he wanted to get a

13:00.014 --> 13:08.548
reconnaissance to see whether we had anything, 
which we didn't have. Mm-hmm. Fortifications or

13:09.224 --> 13:11.266
troops all dug in. Well, when he said that about 
Leavenworth, what'd you say? I just shook my head.

13:15.091 --> 13:17.473
That wasn't funny to me. And he was right. I would 
never conduct a river crossing that way.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.501
Surprise, yes. If you really go slip up there and 
all, they want you to throw this across without

13:24.521 --> 13:29.166
them manning their guns. They already probed it 
with reconnaissance. They knew what it was. So

13:35.397 --> 13:39.623
what they were trying to do, we were trying to do, is 
just overwhelm them, you know, with bodies.

13:41.445 --> 13:46.111
That's pretty hard to do with machine guns firing 
at you, mortars and artillery. In fact, many of our

13:46.131 --> 13:57.206
boats were pneumatic, of course, shrapnel or 
fragments deflated, big ripping, gacking holes

13:46.131 --> 13:57.206
in them. And that's before we ever tried to do it. So 
you can see how well anybody said, okay, they're

14:00.650 --> 14:04.155
going to try to have it. Boat parking, wherever it 
is. Tell me a little bit more about this scene. Did

14:11.418 --> 14:18.627
the other Germans that they sent over during this 
truce, did they speak English too? I don't know.

14:19.908 --> 14:21.730
See, most of the action was on the other side. I 
didn't go on the other side. I stayed on our side. I

14:27.597 --> 14:31.442
went on the other side during the attack and came 
back. But what happened during the truce is that

14:32.435 --> 14:39.601
they sent this German officer over for one hour to 
your headquarters, basically? No. Well, how did

14:40.002 --> 14:41.503
you meet this one? I'm a little confused. Okay, the 
chaplain arranged for this truce. I know I talk

14:46.647 --> 14:48.609
about this, and I just say it. You say, well, if you 
can do this, why in the hell are we fighting each

14:48.629 --> 14:51.932
other, see? You know, if it's this simple, let 
somebody else do it. The chaplain arranged for it.

14:57.517 --> 15:02.121
And the second truce, which I'll get to later, I 
have a paper on that, like, find it somewhere. It

15:04.396 --> 15:10.562
was written up by the Inspector General who was 
involved in the second one. I went down to Water's

15:10.583 --> 15:13.826
Edge, actually arranged for it. They came down to 
the channels, headquartered it, say a truce had

15:13.846 --> 15:21.093
been arranged and gave the grid square for this 
particular time. So my only job down there was to go

15:22.114 --> 15:30.403
down there and just observe on my own, rather than 
sleeping or trying to get ready to go in a few hours.

15:31.649 --> 15:34.934
The German had no responsibility at all either. He 
just came as a sightseer also. But he couldn't

15:38.098 --> 15:45.148
resist seeing me on the other side and with the 
ponton type of bridge that we had there till across

15:38.098 --> 15:45.148
the river. He came on over there on this side. But we 
probably should have done this, captured him when

15:49.435 --> 15:53.721
he got over there, even during the truce with him 
being so cocky. But he was right. And that's about

15:54.642 --> 15:57.366
all the conversation, because I wasn't going to 
talk with him. Why not? I was too beaten up.

16:04.133 --> 16:06.215
The next truce, I did a lot of talking. What were 
your feelings toward when, I mean, were the

16:06.235 --> 16:20.792
people, did they have a lot of hatred for the enemy, 
or were they indifferent during this truce, or did

16:06.235 --> 16:20.792
they think it was a humane thing to have this truce? 
What did the people feel like? What did your

16:22.374 --> 16:23.855
soldiers and you feel like? Well, I guess I think it 
was humane, because we're the ones who asked for it

16:25.237 --> 16:33.626
and benefited from it. I guess that You had a few 
troops around. What do you think about this? They

16:37.895 --> 16:50.413
said, well, I think it's good to get these wounded 
back and bodies back because they're one of us.

16:50.433 --> 16:53.858
Whether they think this is the proper way to fight a 
war or not, I don't know. I don't think probably an

16:54.419 --> 17:01.950
infantry officer would have even thought about 
asking for a troop. Certainly we don't have any

17:03.483 --> 17:06.908
manuals and on certain conditions this is what you 
do. You contact the enemy and ask for truce. That's

17:10.132 --> 17:11.774
almost medieval. Do you remember what the 
chaplain's name was? But he instigated this

17:16.981 --> 17:18.543
truce. Yeah.

17:22.429 --> 17:25.012
Along with the Red Cross flag, I mean, they went 
down. What a difference between fighting in

17:25.533 --> 17:30.840
Europe and fighting in the Orient. Yeah. For the 
Japanese. But anyway. The Germans, to give

17:37.172 --> 17:39.937
another one, I was talking about Denholm earlier. 
Denholm got captured in North Africa. And they

17:44.023 --> 17:51.616
took him and inventoried his money, his 
pocketbook, and put it in an envelope. Let him keep

17:51.636 --> 17:54.220
his watch. And treated him just like... The 
president of war is supposed to be treated. He'd

18:01.982 --> 18:04.826
treat him as an officer and a gentleman, fed him 
well. He later escaped and later on got wounded.

18:12.536 --> 18:23.291
But that's the type of standard that the German 
Army had because they were very professional,

18:12.536 --> 18:23.291
especially that North Africa Corps. Not many 
draftees at that time because, see, that was the

18:23.331 --> 18:28.418
elite unit that they had. But then what we had left, 
we went back on up and relieved the 24th. And I was in

18:34.117 --> 18:36.320
charge in the battalion. I had about less than 200 
men left. Out of how many? And now we have a new

18:42.687 --> 18:44.469
commanding officer. This is named Paul D. Adams, 
who later on got to be a four-star gentleman. But

18:48.954 --> 18:55.502
out of the battalion, I guess we had, at that time, 
probably 650 or 700. So you lost. Out of 700, you

18:58.696 --> 19:01.219
only had 200 left? Yeah. What a casualty rate. 
Yeah, you can look at the journals and see it each

19:04.823 --> 19:06.925
month. You know, we listed the people that were 
killed. Was morale decreasing because of this

19:09.589 --> 19:15.135
tremendous casualty rate? Yeah, but war...

19:15.155 --> 19:24.747
Infantry particularly, you got... I'm talking 
about now like in Italy or like in the Far East that

19:26.515 --> 19:37.905
they had in those campaigns there, particularly 
in the islands where Peter went all the time. He got

19:37.925 --> 19:42.950
rocked.

19:42.970 --> 19:49.376
It almost becomes

19:42.970 --> 19:49.376
a case of survival. And you're mad at anybody 
that's making your life so miserable. I don't mean

19:54.340 --> 19:56.202
you're mad at the president. I don't care who it is 
that cross there that's causing you all of this

19:56.992 --> 20:02.758
sort of thing. And you, I don't know why you'd call 
it hatred, but it's just a, if I'm going to be this

20:02.778 --> 20:17.993
miserable and I'm going to have all these 
casualties, well, I'm going to see that you have it

20:02.778 --> 20:17.993
as bad as we are, or worse, hopefully. Now, France 
and Germany, it was a different war, you thought.

20:22.117 --> 20:22.217
Yeah. I'm talking about now where you, gosh, I got 
trench foot. in Italy, up in the mountains in the

20:27.232 --> 20:31.036
cold, rain season. And of course it says, change 
your socks, you don't keep them. We didn't have any

20:34.380 --> 20:35.160
socks. We changed, everything was wet. So the time 
we got out, the peat was kind of shriveled up. And

20:40.326 --> 20:41.427
then we took a hot shower. And boy, they get about 
twice the size. And it was all swollen up. You can't

20:44.771 --> 20:46.572
walk. And it takes a long time to get over it. And 
that's what happened later on. Now we're up above

20:50.957 --> 20:55.602
Cassino, above and behind at Monaco Center.

21:00.838 --> 21:02.740
Just thinned up there. We have emplacements, 
machine guns. So the Germans mounted a massive

21:06.604 --> 21:09.467
attack. Artillery and mortars, they slammed to us 
for about an hour. Well, we dug in and we sustained

21:13.532 --> 21:18.157
the attack pretty well. Then they came. We put down 
all our artillery and machine guns on them. But

21:23.523 --> 21:25.285
what really killed them was that their artillery 
wasn't clearing the mask of the hill. It wasn't

21:31.904 --> 21:33.546
coming up and coming down. It was slamming into 
their own troops. Their own artillery was

21:37.030 --> 21:39.232
slamming into their own troops? Yes. Wow. So 
finally got all quiet, see. And then daylight

21:44.057 --> 21:46.980
finally came. And I got out there and I started 
looking, and we had German bodies all over the

21:47.000 --> 21:51.585
place. Wounded Germans.

21:56.551 --> 22:00.096
They could easily overrun us if it hadn't been for 
that, because once again, they had the truth. But

22:00.116 --> 22:02.399
this is an all-mountain, you know. So it's not a 
case of as you climb, you get all up there, and then

22:02.419 --> 22:07.966
you get a red detect. And they didn't realize it 
because they were firing at night. Yeah. So, lo and

22:13.413 --> 22:19.101
behold, later that day, the Germans had asked for 
truth.

22:21.925 --> 22:25.309
Now, this is a different unit, you know, and 
everything about it is old. We were in better shape

22:27.314 --> 22:28.656
then. We had very few cavemen. So we were all dug in, 
and they never got to the hand-in-hand combat. So

22:34.545 --> 22:35.586
this was arranged. And this one, because I got to 
say, I got a piece of paper somewhere. The

22:38.010 --> 22:41.835
inspector general wrote up this one. So he was up 
there. So it must have been a division before they

22:43.037 --> 22:47.143
came up. So the Germans came up

22:47.163 --> 22:52.291
to pick up their dead.

22:55.355 --> 22:56.477
So here comes a German. officer up to who would say 
he spoke a little broken and different from down

22:56.778 --> 23:04.430
there, that this guy here looked more combat like 
he did. And he spoke English, and so I told him that

23:05.492 --> 23:20.857
I thought that the German artillery was better 
trained to

23:05.492 --> 23:20.857
fall short and kill their own troops. Don't they 
teach them better than that in the artillery

23:21.278 --> 23:23.882
school? What did he have to say to that? He said, I'm 
afraid you're right. That's what he said? I'm

23:29.490 --> 23:30.651
afraid you're right? They realized that all over 
that they wanted to give us credit, which, of

23:32.973 --> 23:37.979
course, is all right. That's good for your morale, 
too, if you don't think your own people are. But

23:43.684 --> 23:47.028
that's where the heavy caves were, right down just 
short. Before they ever got into our line of fire,

23:47.748 --> 23:52.333
before they came up, see? And they asked for an 
extension on that because they had a heck of a time,

23:53.309 --> 23:57.454
you know, getting those people. In other words, 
they needed more than an hour? Yeah, and it was

24:00.138 --> 24:01.580
granted. But once again, it was a peculiar 
situation. And you could hear all the firing going

24:05.124 --> 24:08.329
on all around, you see. It's just quiet around that 
Monte Cassino area. So that's my two experiences

24:13.215 --> 24:17.781
on truces during the war.

24:20.562 --> 24:24.247
Do you remember what rank this German officer was? 
But he looked pretty combat. He wasn't spit and

24:29.514 --> 24:32.058
polish. Was he arrogant like the first one? No.

24:38.146 --> 24:42.292
You don't find many arrogant infantry officers in 
combat. Especially if they're tired. Like those

24:43.453 --> 24:45.376
cartoons, Willie and Joe. That cartoon all you can 
get. How do you know if he's a fresh troop if you

24:49.840 --> 24:53.926
don't wake him up and ask him? You know, there's two 
old guys leading on his rifle. That's a fresh

24:56.911 --> 24:57.912
troop. Well,

24:57.932 --> 25:04.502
anyway, we finally went on up to Anzio. Now, I 
mention this because

25:05.964 --> 25:18.463
this time, the Corps commander, and Clark's still 
Army commander, takes a recommendation of

25:19.962 --> 25:22.585
General Walker, the commanding general of the 
36th. And it turned out what should have been

25:24.227 --> 25:30.934
another bloodbath, like Rapido, turned out to be 
brilliant.

25:33.297 --> 25:43.729
Anzio, of course, is down in a broad plain that goes 
along the coast all the way to Rome, but still a lot

25:33.297 --> 25:43.729
of mountainous territory around it. Well, the 
plain doesn't go all the way to Rome. There's

25:45.091 --> 25:47.774
another group of mountains before you get to Rome. 
Anyway, there's some plain. So we're in the

25:50.708 --> 25:53.913
beachhead in the plane. And because we're under 
observation all the time, there was a perpetual

25:53.933 --> 26:03.868
smoke stream all around the edge of the perimeter. 
So the Germans up in the high ground couldn't

26:03.888 --> 26:06.331
observe. And they didn't have air superiority, so 
they couldn't see very much by plane. Most of their

26:11.980 --> 26:16.586
aircraft operated at night. And the left receives 
astride the main artery that comes down through

26:16.606 --> 26:20.412
that. So the plan was 36th Division to attack the 
left wing

26:20.746 --> 26:29.639
and the flaps a little bit below. Once again, this 
is a frontal attack on a fortified position. At

26:35.808 --> 26:36.990
least they're well dug in. So General Walker this 
time, he went to the corps commander and said, I

26:39.053 --> 26:46.905
have a plan I'd like to submit. And he said, all 
right, what is it? So he told his corps commander,

26:50.805 --> 26:54.470
he said, well, you know, I can't prove this. We'll 
have to go to General Clark and present this

26:54.790 --> 26:59.517
because this is counter to what's already been 
planned. So they went up to General Clark and they

27:00.739 --> 27:03.082
briefed him. And he says, okay, we'll try it. What 
General Walker had done, he had contacted the

27:08.049 --> 27:17.121
Italians around there. And he had been talking 
with this engineer about the desirability of

27:18.475 --> 27:28.995
finding some way over that mountain other than 
going head on against the lecture. And the Italian

27:29.015 --> 27:30.157
said, yes. I know a route that goes over the 
mountain. It's just a trail. Well, the engineer

27:38.860 --> 27:42.224
said, well, can it be widened, you say? He said, 
well, yes. How you going to widen it? He said, we'll

27:45.147 --> 27:46.909
take a bulldozer. We'll get where we can get jeeps 
and trucks over that area. So they made a

27:52.775 --> 27:54.657
reconnaissance. And since the Germans were down 
here, and this mountain rib goes out like this,

27:54.737 --> 28:01.945
they were able to get up there. And they made a 
reconnaissance. And they didn't want to go all the

28:03.126 --> 28:06.370
way over, because they'd give away the plane. And 
the engineer said, sure, he can do that. That's

28:09.462 --> 28:13.209
what they sold General Clark on. So we made what we 
call a Chinese attack, where you pull out all the

28:14.352 --> 28:23.028
stuff, but really nobody moves anymore. You have 
the tanks firing, and even anti-aircraft would be

28:23.048 --> 28:29.541
firing. We did that. And the Germans bought it. 
They thought, well, yeah. They expected, of

28:34.043 --> 28:38.029
course, you're going to break out of that 
beachhead and try to sooner or later would be

28:34.043 --> 28:38.029
great. And hit them frontal. But what you're 
really doing is... Planking them. Yeah, you're

28:43.157 --> 28:44.640
taking the flank. Yeah. Up and over the hill. Yeah. 
And they weren't concerned about that because

28:47.905 --> 28:53.514
only patrols could go over, and they had troops in 
the rear to take care of patrols. Bicycle troops,

28:54.736 --> 28:57.280
by the way. Yeah. And they got surprised because 
they came to the rescue, you know, to knock out this

28:58.595 --> 29:03.580
patrol. And lo and behold, they found out they had a 
two battalion frontal attack against them in the

29:03.620 --> 29:10.647
rear. So while that was all going around, our troop 
pulled out and went on around to the rear, got to

29:10.667 --> 29:17.814
this place. And of course, the infantry went on up 
ahead, which my battalion was a

29:27.417 --> 29:33.625
I wasn't the battalion commander in this 
particular one, but the battalion I was in was

29:27.417 --> 29:33.625
leading the attack. Went on over and got on down. 
And sure enough, it was just about daylight. You

29:40.353 --> 29:43.757
didn't see any Germans anywhere around. So we went 
on down. In the meantime, the engineers using

29:45.959 --> 29:55.551
bulldozers was widening and scraping and 
knocking down trees unnecessarily, getting

29:45.959 --> 29:55.551
rocks out of the way to where The first the jeep to 
get over, and then they kept working and improving

29:56.375 --> 30:02.063
it to where a larger truck could. And by 10 o'clock 
the next morning, we had not only the infantry down

30:02.083 --> 30:12.697
there, but also the supporting weapons, like 
mortars.

30:14.660 --> 30:21.389
So then we moved on out to cut the road behind 
Belletri and start Barone. That was the objective

30:21.609 --> 30:23.031
this time. So we got the entire division, crossed 
that mountain, down behind the Germans. Now the

30:28.255 --> 30:31.901
Germans could only pull out, and they couldn't 
pull back straight. They had to go not quite

30:32.181 --> 30:37.570
parallel with the front line, but behind the 
others. And that, since it's a coordinated

30:38.351 --> 30:41.416
attack, then they all cut loose, see? Because 
after you want to do that, you weaken them, then

30:42.377 --> 30:46.704
these others are getting out of position. It's a 
British unit. So the Germans then are... Not quite

30:50.678 --> 30:52.920
surrounded, but about three quarters. Yeah. So 
they're trying to get out toward Rome, but they

30:53.781 --> 30:57.666
can't go back on the main road because it's cut. So 
they're having to go across, sort of trooping the

30:58.046 --> 31:01.850
line in the rear. And the British unit attack and 
others is a coordinated attack and is very

31:03.052 --> 31:12.542
successful and took a lot of prisoners. The reason 
about the bicycle, when we got there, who wasn't

31:12.562 --> 31:18.829
coming in, you know, to counterattack with a 
company on bicycle?

31:24.226 --> 31:30.816
And I went to Rome, and then later on, of course, we 
went up to pull it out of the line at Pembino. Well,

31:31.237 --> 31:38.167
before we get on that, let's talk for a minute about

31:31.237 --> 31:38.167
the British troops. You worked right with the 
British troops, and the British general in charge

31:39.008 --> 31:46.800
was Alexander at this time. Did you ever have an 
opportunity to see Alexander? Yeah. I was too low

31:53.167 --> 31:54.248
level. I didn't chat with him. He talked to us. How 
did he strike you? He came in North Africa. He came

32:03.180 --> 32:05.302
before we went into Italy. And we didn't have any 
idea what was going to happen. We didn't know that

32:12.211 --> 32:14.654
we had anything to do with the British troops. We 
didn't see anything like that. And he kind of let

32:17.678 --> 32:21.823
the cat out of the bag and he welcomed us to his 
command. And, of course, we all looked at each

32:22.968 --> 32:25.390
other in amazement. What is he talking about? But

32:28.033 --> 32:32.477
he's a real fine. He was basically the Supreme 
Commander of all the troops. So he was over Clark.

32:40.624 --> 32:41.205
Now, how did you get? You thought that he was a real 
fine officer, but you didn't really get an

32:41.805 --> 32:47.831
opportunity to talk to him. No, I know more about 
him on a bread than my business. That's the only

32:50.353 --> 32:51.854
time I ever saw him. OK, now. Of course, during this 
time, the British troops were also in the

32:53.208 --> 32:59.516
campaign. Did you have any opportunity to work 
with the British? Yeah, in Italy we were—

33:02.740 --> 33:07.446
Coordinating efforts with them? And Missoula and 
also the Gurkhas. Of course, they were British

33:10.250 --> 33:14.956
troops, Commonwealth troops, and the Gurkhas. 
And how were they? Would you make a comment on the

33:16.938 --> 33:20.042
quality of these other British troops? Oh, fine. 
had the disadvantage because it galled them

33:24.663 --> 33:47.886
because many of their lorries as they called it 
didn't have four-wheel drive so it all through

33:24.663 --> 33:47.886
italy and elsewhere you know you had a lot of 
bypasses and taking an american vehicle with

33:24.663 --> 33:47.886
winches on it the winch on the british and even then 
a typical british They rationalize it, saying,

33:49.756 --> 33:56.805
well, you bloody Americans, you don't need 
four-wheel drive except at certain times. And so

33:58.006 --> 33:59.648
it's inefficient. We sell them every four-wheel 
drive, so why have it on all your vehicles? So we

34:03.833 --> 34:07.318
say, so we wouldn't have to be wedging you through 
this pipeline. You're holding up our troops.

34:11.322 --> 34:13.405
Is there a pretty good department? And the New 
Zealand troops are really outstanding, too.

34:18.531 --> 34:19.172
Well-trained. They

34:19.540 --> 34:28.552
couldn't understand why they took them away from 
New Zealand and Australia and Australia. And then

34:28.572 --> 34:41.549
we turn around and send American units in New 
Zealand and Australia, particularly Australia,

34:28.572 --> 34:41.549
because they get letters from home, you know, 
about all of their girlfriends and sisters and so

34:28.572 --> 34:41.549
forth that's going with these Yankees. All the 
young men in their country's gone. So the same

34:45.292 --> 34:47.335
thing in Great Britain, of course. We had that big 
contingent waiting for the invasion. Of course,

34:50.238 --> 34:53.322
the British had all their troops around the world. 
But there was never any, as far as you can remember,

34:54.524 --> 35:03.656
there was no animosity between the Americans and 
the British Commonwealth? Not to my knowledge.

35:06.259 --> 35:07.480
Just good cooperation.

35:12.167 --> 35:14.910
I'll tell you a story that really has nothing to do 
with this. like you can even cut the machine off,

35:15.160 --> 35:20.407
you know, about British-American relationship. 
You know, when we were preparing for the invasion,

35:20.908 --> 35:44.340
I wasn't in Great Britain at that time, in England, 
but we had all these troops, and we had horses, and

35:20.908 --> 35:44.340
in one area there, they had a series of messes, 
since you had officers billeted all around, you

35:20.908 --> 35:44.340
know, in different buildings, but they had, I 
guess it was in Hyde Park, that big park, where they

35:44.489 --> 35:48.474
had all these messes lined up like this. And this 
officer, and Eisenhower especially emphasized

35:48.494 --> 36:01.171
he wanted a good relationship with our allies, 
great British since we're in their country, we're

35:48.494 --> 36:01.171
their guests. But he doesn't want our troops to go 
British, you know, to get speaking their

36:02.292 --> 36:07.760
language, all that stuff. But be yourself. But be, 
make sure you're friendly. And this officer right

36:12.446 --> 36:14.108
now, I can't, think his name, Mimi could help me 
because his son was with us up at West Point.

36:22.990 --> 36:27.796
He had been drinking in the middle of the day, so he 
was in this mess. And he got in an argument with a

36:29.399 --> 36:37.390
British officer about some subject like I just 
told you about, you know, four-wheel drive.

36:37.430 --> 36:40.675
Anyway, something in comparison to the military. 
And he was loud and They got in an argument, and

36:43.400 --> 36:51.830
finally the friend that was with him, American 
officer, got him out of the Army and laid him out.

36:51.850 --> 36:54.653
And said, you should not have done that. My God, a 
gentleman out there would go hear about this, and

36:54.774 --> 36:59.799
you would be on the first ship pulling. You 
disgraced yourself and your nation by being so

36:59.819 --> 37:06.307
loud, boisterous, uncouth. And he said, you were 
right. i'm going back and apologize oh no let's

37:11.463 --> 37:40.525
don't do that he says i insist i you're right so he 
went into the mess and this time of course it's all

37:11.463 --> 37:40.525
buzzing you know they're eating like that he 
called for attention though let me have your

37:11.463 --> 37:40.525
attention it took quite a while to get them calm 
quiet and down so he says i want you to know that i

37:11.463 --> 37:40.525
made an ass out of myself i've disgraced my nation, 
and I apologize, and I hope you will accept my

37:41.669 --> 37:46.255
apology. And he was just so quiet and old, looking 
at him like, what in the hell is going on? He had gone

37:52.502 --> 37:54.264
into the wrong mess. He'd gone into another

37:54.284 --> 37:59.971
mess. He said, that really happened. Of course, I 
never heard about this. Obviously, that was the

38:03.516 --> 38:06.660
talk of the clubs. I bet you the British got in 
charge of that.

38:14.221 --> 38:18.367
When you went up into Rome, what were the 
conditions in that city like? Well, it was good

38:19.028 --> 38:21.292
because Rome had been an open city. There wasn't 
any damage. And the bridges were all intact

38:24.056 --> 38:29.364
because they're beautiful bridges, works of art. 
And, of course, Rome was really welcome. You could

38:32.749 --> 38:34.552
barely get the vehicles through the street. 
Because, I say, America was popular, at least

38:35.473 --> 38:40.841
then, all through Italy.

38:42.423 --> 38:43.485
In fact, to go back, In Italy, you remember here 
recently they had those terrible earthquakes

38:45.085 --> 38:56.720
where it found one of those villages I had been in 
and entertained it. When those people got

38:56.740 --> 39:09.557
captured between the Salerno and Colorado River, 
two officers

38:56.740 --> 39:09.557
that was captured, the Germans loaded them on a 
train that was heading north. And of course, they

39:11.259 --> 39:12.240
threatened them. If anybody tries to escape, 
we'll shoot all of them. But they saw an

39:17.313 --> 39:23.042
opportunity during the night to jump off the train 
while it was moving. Of course, it wasn't going

39:23.102 --> 39:24.524
very fast. And they escaped. They went up the 
mountain to this village in the Italian. And

39:30.452 --> 39:31.754
they're really poor people. They're villages 
because they work the vineyards and everything.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.442
They live together, but they really have nothing. 
They make their own wine, and they have chicken

39:37.703 --> 39:41.248
with eggs. And you know that they give most of their 
eggs and chickens to the Catholic Church, to the

39:41.752 --> 39:50.180
Padres, who really live very nicely.

39:53.142 --> 39:56.305
So they took these two officers and hid them. They 
put them in a potato bin off of the . And of course,

39:58.647 --> 40:04.533
the German patrol came around looking for them and 
threatened to kill all Italians. And they said, we

40:05.393 --> 40:07.715
don't know anybody in America. And they didn't 
find them. And then they would send up food for them

40:10.625 --> 40:14.188
to eat and water. And they stayed hidden for 
several days. And about, I guess, two weeks later,

40:17.311 --> 40:23.317
we moved on up. And then they could rejoin the crew. 
Well, later on, I had never been there. Later on,

40:30.323 --> 40:32.085
Quarles, that's his name. He's a Colonel Reserve 
officer. He's a very prominent lawyer in Florida,

40:35.308 --> 40:38.050
Miami. The other officer was later killed.

40:44.624 --> 40:53.038
He said, since we're out of the line, we've got a few 
days, would you like to go with me back up to the

40:44.624 --> 40:53.038
village for these people who helped me? Had me hit 
and all this time. So I said, yeah. So we got some

40:57.807 --> 41:02.054
things from the kitchen that they could spare. We 
got chocolate candies, things that other people

41:04.270 --> 41:07.735
had that they could let us out. And he would load it 
up the Jeep with all that sort of stuff. And went up

41:11.000 --> 41:12.161
into that mountain. Very difficult to get even in 
the Jeep because it goes way up. Most people just

41:16.488 --> 41:17.549
walk. And when they saw him, they all turned up. Oh, 
and they're singing and dancing and they brought

41:23.218 --> 41:31.830
out their wine and he handed that out to them and 
they cried and they embraced him. But the sad part

41:32.435 --> 41:39.065
of the story is that was the village that was one of 
the villages that they had all those caves. Just

41:39.987 --> 41:42.470
put way up in the mountain. And the buildings, oh 
gosh, they're several hundred years old. In fact,

41:47.118 --> 41:55.911
sometimes it's old you think that they had been 
ravaged by gunfire or something, you know,

41:47.118 --> 41:55.911
because some were cracking and falling off.

42:00.211 --> 42:24.436
During this time, there was a lot of discussion 
between Roosevelt, Churchill, and American and

42:00.211 --> 42:24.436
British military commanders about not invading 
southern France, but invading through Austria

42:00.211 --> 42:24.436
and through the Alps and the so-called soft 
underbelly of Europe, which of course George

42:00.211 --> 42:24.436
Marshall thought was absolutely out of the 
question. Was any of this discussed down on the

42:24.476 --> 42:28.240
lines? Never. When did you hear about this? Later? 
Too low rank later on. Too low. I'm not even sure

42:39.401 --> 42:45.349
that some of the very senior people knew about that 
discussion.

42:51.436 --> 43:00.728
I didn't know until after the war that

42:51.436 --> 43:00.728
we made this landing in Africa or reinforced it. as 
evidence that we were doing something.

43:07.724 --> 43:17.556
But as you say, Churchill said, all that's wasted 
evidence because the future, post-war, will be

43:07.724 --> 43:17.556
most important. Because he saw the danger of 
communism, or USSR, I should say. He hadn't even

43:23.022 --> 43:24.965
gotten away from communism himself. That that 
would be the threat.

43:31.808 --> 43:50.185
Was he looking for a way to defeat Hitler, and at the 
same time, profit by, to better stabilize, at

43:31.808 --> 43:50.185
least not the world, at least the Western 
position.

43:50.205 --> 43:58.973
But I don't think all that battle in North Africa 
was for naught, because it gave us a first victory

43:50.205 --> 43:58.973
for the Allies.

43:58.993 --> 44:00.634
And it turns out now that it is. But

44:02.116 --> 44:12.488
for a while it looked like he was really on the 
track. Of course, Tito didn't break away, but he

44:12.568 --> 44:25.744
came almost neutral, at least because he was so 
closely tied to the USSR. When did you first learn

44:26.144 --> 44:28.427
about Operation Anvil, the invasion of southern 
France, which took place in June 1944.

44:44.931 --> 44:54.721
We were up, as I said, in Piovino,

44:44.931 --> 44:54.721
which is getting up in the extreme north of Italy. 
And we were pulled out and went all the way back to

44:56.182 --> 44:59.646
Naples. And then, of course, we knew that we were 
getting ready to go somewhere because delighted

45:00.132 --> 45:09.480
to get out of Italy. Why? Because of the terrain and 
the weather, not because of the time. You know what

45:14.825 --> 45:19.269
it is to live like an animal for all winter, living 
in a home and eating. I got where the eating those K

45:20.030 --> 45:24.254
rations they call them. I don't know whether you 
remember those things. I don't know if you've seen

45:25.615 --> 45:26.395
them. This had these canned egg and old crackers 
that taste like because they had lemon crystals

45:29.393 --> 45:57.088
and lemon crystals you couldn't mix with water in 
other words it was a packaged ration that was

45:29.393 --> 45:57.088
really unsuccessful it might have been all right 
but eat it two or three days but the cheese i got to

45:29.393 --> 45:57.088
wear that i couldn't keep anything down no i'm 
kidding the food was so bad that you were vomiting

45:29.393 --> 45:57.088
all the time you had this problem with the feet it 
had come back back up now The reason we weren't

45:57.558 --> 46:00.342
eating sea rations is because they were heavier. 
See, we didn't have helicopters there. We were

46:02.886 --> 46:04.848
supplied by mules. No kidding. And you couldn't 
even supply a lot of arms. You couldn't get trucks

46:09.415 --> 46:10.957
up to you? Oh, no. We were up on top of those 
mountains. We were supplied by mules up at Monte

46:15.283 --> 46:22.333
Cassino, up where that attack occurred. You 
couldn't get vehicles. Well, you couldn't even

46:25.698 --> 46:27.160
get them halfway. There was a village halfway up, a 
small village, but they had just a winding walk

46:28.726 --> 46:35.058
type of thing. And mules make good pack animals, 
but horses, you know, horses love them. Because a

46:41.069 --> 46:47.882
horse,

46:41.069 --> 46:47.882
well first a mule's just smarter than a horse, more 
intelligent. Whether it's innate intelligence

46:48.123 --> 46:52.050
or what it is.
