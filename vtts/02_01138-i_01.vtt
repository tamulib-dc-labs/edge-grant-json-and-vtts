WEBVTT

00:04.520 --> 00:05.021
Testing. One, two, three. I guess you might as well 
just start out and you might as well just talk about

00:06.784 --> 00:12.074
death for a minute. I had the essay from the first 
time you ever saw a dead man. And I realized that you

00:19.869 --> 00:22.013
were a child. And death is a part of life out here, 
too. Very much. And let me tell you that I wasn't but

00:29.540 --> 00:40.554
18 years old when I was called on to come and help 
dress a corpse. To dress a, yeah. And you know,

00:42.797 --> 00:48.464
that's something that people don't touch their 
bodies anymore. They send them on. But I was 18

00:50.807 --> 00:53.410
years old. And Miss came back, called me, and she 
said, you're just as well to learn. You have to face

00:59.023 --> 01:01.966
it sooner or later. And I said, oh, I just don't 
believe it. She said, oh, yes, you can. And she

01:06.913 --> 01:10.378
sighed, and she put her hands on my shoulders. And 
she looked me straight in the eye. She says, honey,

01:13.642 --> 01:18.348
dead people don't hurt you. It's the live ones that 
give you trouble. So these have laid all of their

01:22.145 --> 01:37.405
troubles down, and the least we can do is to make it 
pleasant for them for their last minutes here on

01:22.145 --> 01:37.405
this earth. And she says, Do you know when you go 
take a bath how much better that you feel and how

01:37.745 --> 01:49.120
much you really enjoy it? I said, Yes. She said, 
Well, when we wash all of this earthly

01:51.136 --> 02:13.279
feeding off of this body and put it in God's hands, 
we've done one of the greatest things that you can

01:51.136 --> 02:13.279
do for humanity. and I thought, I've never heard 
anyone express it like that. She said, that's the

02:22.208 --> 02:30.237
last respects that you can pay that person and put 
them in God's care. So you washed the body. So I

02:33.881 --> 02:42.490
washed the body, and I will never forget it if I live 
to be a million years old. That was a big chore. But

02:44.691 --> 02:51.276
then when she said, and you turn it over to God, and 
it's in his care. It's clean. She says, when the

02:52.738 --> 02:59.523
baby comes, you wash it with earthly water. Wash it 
in earthly water and return it to God who gave it. No

03:06.369 --> 03:08.431
one had ever talked to me like that. No one had ever 
said anything to me like that. So I have, I think, I

03:12.608 --> 03:22.906
thought that that was one of the sweetest ways to 
learn that ever was. It is. It was hard. I bet it was.

03:29.888 --> 03:32.031
And I do understand. I mean, I know, too, that 
there's a kindness in a death. Sure. That doesn't

03:38.018 --> 03:41.042
show up at any other time in this country. No. But 
the day we're born, there's a time set aside for our

03:42.124 --> 03:48.171
deaths. And regardless of what comes, it's going 
to be there. It's going to be there. And... God has a

03:54.880 --> 03:59.065
purpose for all of us. And we have a job to do. It may 
take us a long time to find it and to fly right to get

04:03.030 --> 04:09.657
it. But we have it, and we'll do it. And you said you 
believe that your purpose in life, that you still

04:13.782 --> 04:20.951
have purpose. I remember, I'm going to go back to 
the time that I met you, Because that's of a very

04:25.357 --> 04:28.983
important value to me. And that is the time that you 
had that massive heart attack and you were giving

04:30.465 --> 04:36.155
up. And I remember, I remember that you just made a 
decision. I hope I played a role in it. I like to

04:45.450 --> 04:46.812
think that I did. You sure did. And you, of course, 
have fulfilled the purpose of my life since. And

04:56.282 --> 04:59.076
I'm glad that you decided not To give up working on 
life and helping other people, because that's

05:00.018 --> 05:04.964
what you've done. You know, I really thought that 
my day's work was over. I did, too. I didn't know. I

05:12.853 --> 05:13.794
was scared. I really did. I really thought, well, 
this is the end. I can't make a comeback now. I'm too

05:20.221 --> 05:20.882
old. Yeah. Well, I think you can... My grandfather 
always said, hold to the end of the road. Hold to the

05:30.336 --> 05:31.938
end of the road. Never leave it shabby.

05:36.724 --> 05:37.225
All right. I didn't hold to the end of the road. 
There was something left for me to do. Now, what it

05:45.756 --> 05:47.338
is right now, I actually believe this with all my 
heart. And I believe it stronger today than I've

05:51.049 --> 06:02.847
ever believed it before, is helping little folks 
like I help today. Having those three little

06:03.468 --> 06:12.342
children to come, and actually the first time in 
their life to know what they were doing. To me, that

06:12.362 --> 06:15.587
is worth... A lifetime. Now, to get out here and for 
praise for the public, I wouldn't give you two

06:18.156 --> 06:26.235
cents and a half. But God knows what I was doing. And 
he knew I was working to make better children. And

06:32.881 --> 06:35.225
he knows what I do. Now, Ava, I know, I just, I think 
above race, creed, or color, it doesn't matter to

06:36.326 --> 06:43.217
you. I don't. It don't matter one bit. You have such 
a value to go on and to do that kind of work in this

06:45.400 --> 06:50.588
world. I've watched you do it. And it stems from 
that belief that you do row to the end of the, you

06:51.630 --> 06:56.938
know, the hole to the end of the rope. The end of the 
rope. And you do what has to be done. That's true.

07:02.885 --> 07:04.046
There was a little German. There was a little, 
well. Yeah, from Guatemala, you said? Guatemala.

07:11.795 --> 07:11.935
Uh-huh. And then this other little boy was born in 
the Yucatan. Yeah. He was from Guatemala, too.

07:24.949 --> 07:26.350
Yeah, somewhere down there. Yeah. All right. Now 
they're all different. And they've come up under

07:31.845 --> 07:34.709
different environments. And all together 
different ways of life.

07:41.897 --> 07:44.340
You didn't see any difference shown in those 
children. No, they were all children. They were

07:46.303 --> 07:47.684
all children to me. They were all God's children. 
And I was put here to help them. Well, like I see on

07:56.169 --> 08:01.778
that wall, I see the certificate of a tree that's 
been planted. And I'm going to get that down and

08:02.800 --> 08:08.109
read it right now because I know what it says, okay? 
I just love it. Because it's the victory forest in

08:11.684 --> 08:15.569
Jerusalem, right? That's right. And that's in 
honor of a great teacher, Ms. Ava Johnson Cox, from

08:17.591 --> 08:23.879
a thankful student. That's Eileen Balinski. 
That's pretty terrific. Not many. How many people

08:31.028 --> 08:35.253
do you know that have a tree planted? Well, I don't. 
You don't know too many. No, uh-uh. You don't, and

08:42.650 --> 08:45.053
that's really nice. Nice? Yeah, it's beautiful. 
To me, it's one of the greatest things that ever

08:49.357 --> 08:52.981
happened. Yeah, everything.

08:59.108 --> 09:09.619
I don't want

08:59.108 --> 09:09.619
people, when I die, to get up and say, oh, she was a 
wonderful person, she did this, she did that. All I

09:10.308 --> 09:15.012
want that minister to say, this woman lived. And 
when I say lived, she lived every day to the fullest

09:16.994 --> 09:23.840
extent. She gave her all, regardless of whatever 
it was she had to do. And I do. I put out every ounce of

09:31.266 --> 09:38.293
energy that's in my body for whatever I've got to do 
that day. And hope that I have another day coming to

09:39.451 --> 09:44.399
do. This one is the Texas Department of Aid on Aging 
Certificate of Appreciation to Ava Johnson Cox

09:44.419 --> 09:56.499
for volunteer service to older Texans. And that's 
signed by the governor. And a Republican at that.

10:00.826 --> 10:01.647
Yeah, I noticed that. I will have to say Clements 
signed it. We'll excuse that. But that's a grant.

10:08.537 --> 10:11.581
And that's Augusta Lucia? How do you say that? 
Augusta Lucia, Jr. And who is? She's the Hebrew

10:17.049 --> 10:18.451
girl. Is she? Yeah. Uh-huh. The chairman or 
president of the Texas Department on Aging?

10:30.397 --> 10:32.499
And you feel proud of things like that, Saban. 
Well, that's what I say. You said I had no feeling of

10:33.820 --> 10:38.184
class, color, or creed, and I don't. I know. You 
don't. You really don't. Well, I go back and, you

10:40.626 --> 10:43.088
know, I do. Just look at Armando yesterday. I know. 
Just as thrilled to see him come out, put his arms

10:45.710 --> 10:49.734
around me and kiss me. I know. Just as good a Mexican 
as ever lived. That's right. A question, too, I

10:54.078 --> 11:00.403
want to ask you here, because, again, every now and 
then, you know, we have to refer to the to Lyndon

11:00.383 --> 11:20.873
because he affected your life because of who he was 
and again I want to ask you if you think people say

11:00.383 --> 11:20.873
about him that he didn't really believe in those 
civil rights policies that they belong to JFK You

11:22.287 --> 11:23.530
know what I'm talking about. Yes, I know. But that 
he didn't really have that incentive. But I want to

11:27.258 --> 11:30.365
know, do you think he did or do you think he didn't? 
He doggone sure did. Because it comes from you,

11:32.810 --> 11:35.596
from your family. Yes, it comes from our family 
tree. And I'll tell you, he loved those people.

11:41.052 --> 11:42.173
Now, he really did. He pushed civil rights from 
JFK. Yes, sir. He pushed it not from JFK. He pushed

11:49.582 --> 11:52.326
it because he believed in it. Okay, that I want to 
say to you. And he told me when I went to San Antonio

11:54.929 --> 12:01.377
to teach, that's the greatest thing that I ever did 
in my life. And that I... God would reward me for

12:02.618 --> 12:06.544
what I had done for those little Mexican children. 
Because you taught in a minority program. I

12:08.828 --> 12:09.769
certainly did. You went straight to do that. 
That's all I did. Right. Now, what school was that

12:14.036 --> 12:16.119
that you taught in? Well, I first started out in 
John F. Kennedy in San Antonio. Okay. And, well, it

12:22.349 --> 12:25.213
was all in Edgewood District. Edgewood, right. 
And that's the poorest district there in San

12:26.054 --> 12:30.461
Antonio. Right. And Stani, Stano, uh...

12:37.617 --> 13:02.697
steinheiser

12:37.617 --> 13:02.697
was my principal and he was the best thing to me that 
ever was and he knew that i had that little mexican

12:37.617 --> 13:02.697
feelings at heart and he he did everything he could 
to help me he was a good man yeah and i'm not sorry for

12:37.617 --> 13:02.697
for working as hard as i did i'd do it again tomorrow 
you drove Before you moved to San Antonio, I know

13:03.503 --> 13:07.288
how you got your education. Did you just stop 
planting tomatoes one day and made a decision you

13:07.929 --> 13:12.715
were going to do something? I said that was the 
hardest work I ever did in my life, and I could make a

13:12.815 --> 13:24.651
living a lot easier than I could working two acres 
of tomatoes with a hoe. So I bundled up my little

13:24.833 --> 13:33.186
self and went to San Marcos in the summer of 48. And I 
started out with 12 hours that I had gotten back in

13:33.447 --> 13:40.979
19 and 23 and 24. And that was two hour courses at a 
time. That's all the college credits that I had.

13:51.074 --> 13:54.899
Got a certificate standing for it that summer. 
That type, yeah. You know, that type. Well, I got a

13:58.043 --> 14:03.870
four-year certificate because I made an average 
of 85 on all my courses. Well, anyway, a six-year

14:04.791 --> 14:08.075
certificate. That's what it was. If you make an 
average of 85, you get a six-year. And if you make an

14:11.840 --> 14:14.884
average of 75, you get a four-year. Minus 85, thank 
goodness. I did have a little sense then. So

14:18.969 --> 14:20.811
anyway. I got my certificate. I enrolled in the 
fall semester. I taught school every day and went

14:25.598 --> 14:30.886
to school every night. And in 1950, I walked down 
the aisle with my BS degree. And I taught school

14:38.577 --> 14:40.420
every day. And 1952, I got my master's degree. But I 
took it easy. I just didn't go every night to

14:49.558 --> 14:51.741
school. You went? On Saturdays. You went to school 
on Saturdays. Every Saturday. In order to get your

14:57.990 --> 14:58.891
master's degree. To get my master's degree. And 
you did that at Trinity, though, didn't you? At San

15:02.316 --> 15:04.038
Antonio. I got my BS degree at Trinity and my 
master's degree at St. Mark's.

15:12.496 --> 15:16.525
But I want to tell you right now, I took work at the 
University of Texas. I took work at Lubbock. I took

15:18.509 --> 15:26.927
work at Arkansas and Sam Houston, A&M.

15:29.759 --> 15:30.720
I believe that's all. And the hardest school of all 
of them is Trinity University. Don't kid

15:34.765 --> 15:36.327
yourself. You've really got to get out and get with 
it. Oh, I did too. I took some Bible study out at the

15:41.132 --> 15:45.857
Lady of the Lake. I'll tell you that. I took history 
of the Bible, and that made me sit up and take

15:48.260 --> 15:54.047
notice. Then I took the Old Testament. Then I took 
the New Testament.

16:00.117 --> 16:01.800
I've had it. And it was hard. But in order to 
understand our history, if you don't understand

16:03.903 --> 16:19.868
the Jewish or Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob's laws and 
the beginning of this thing, it's just hard for you

16:03.903 --> 16:19.868
to ever get it down. Well, that's something I want 
to ask you about religion. I'm aware that in

16:24.576 --> 16:26.479
Texas... We have a new religion, and it's the New 
Testament. But the old-time religions in Texas

16:30.250 --> 16:34.497
didn't just start there. They began in the 
beginning. God created the earth and taught

16:36.700 --> 16:40.526
through Genesis on up. And I wonder if today's 
religion isn't short-sighting itself, because

16:40.546 --> 16:50.320
this community is still an old community. And I 
know it's an Old Testament community. Well, it's

16:55.248 --> 16:59.893
just, I think that's the reason most of these broke 
off from the Methodist Church. It's still the old

16:59.993 --> 17:03.196
Methodist Church. I can remember, as a little 
girl, we came in the Methodist Church, we knelt.

17:10.044 --> 17:11.185
That was God's house. And we came in. We were quiet. 
And we knelt. We went to our pew. We knelt. We made

17:19.126 --> 17:23.171
the sign of the cross and we said our prayer while we 
were there. It was quietly said, but we said it.

17:27.336 --> 17:29.379
There was a cross up in the front. We knew what that 
cross signified. Today, you just walk in that

17:33.203 --> 17:41.834
church and they start talking and they visit and 
they yak, yak, yak. That I just cannot take. That is

17:46.058 --> 17:47.259
sacred. And in the temple, don't you remember, 
they were cast out because they did that? And I

17:51.984 --> 17:53.245
can't tell. There's something in me that boils up 
that I can't help. I know. And I like to go to the

17:59.271 --> 18:06.157
Pentecostal church and hear them because they do 
have lots of good services. But I can't stand the

18:06.698 --> 18:13.745
screaming because in the beginning, God said that 
couldn't be. Yeah. And in the temple, when they

18:15.168 --> 18:21.535
began to carry on like that, they were let out. And I 
guess I'm just, I don't know what's wrong with me.

18:28.363 --> 18:31.767
How do you feel that things have a sacredness? 
There's a sacredness that I can't get away from.

18:36.412 --> 18:37.453
And I know one thing. I got up and walked out of 
church one time, and I don't think I was over it. six

18:43.450 --> 19:06.589
or seven years old of course we didn't have such 
things the bathroom but i had to tinkle and i got up

18:43.450 --> 19:06.589
and walked out of the church and my daddy just 
blistered my little seat good because i didn't

18:43.450 --> 19:06.589
whisper to him and tell him that i needed to go to the 
bathroom i got up and walked out of the church and

18:43.450 --> 19:06.589
walked around behind the old hack and sat down and 
tinkled all right he said little girls don't do

19:07.008 --> 19:20.781
things like that little girls don't nice little 
girls don't get up and leave while the minister's

19:07.008 --> 19:20.781
talking nice little girls Don't interrupt 
services by walking out. Well, I got knees. Now,

19:30.407 --> 19:33.251
that's three things I want you to remember. And I 
got three swats for each of them. That was nine

19:36.195 --> 19:37.317
swats. I remember them. I remember. Every time you 
were also disciplined as a child, you were

19:42.093 --> 19:47.178
disciplined with a principle. Isn't that true? 
That's right. Every time there was a reason for it.

19:51.322 --> 19:53.464
Yeah, that's important. Oh, and I tell you right 
now, I'd rather to have been whipped so many times

19:53.484 --> 19:59.350
than for my daddy to sit down and talk to me. Talking 
to you was worse than getting stanky. He'd set me on

20:02.953 --> 20:07.558
his lap and he'd say, my little princess did me 
wrong. I didn't think that she'd ever do that. And

20:11.705 --> 20:15.291
she... Honey, why did you do that? What made you? 
Oh. I hurt my daddy's feelings. Oh, that was bad.

20:30.056 --> 20:30.998
But again... You know, I think of the things back to 
education and how many years you worked in San

20:32.159 --> 20:37.924
Antonio. How many years again was it? I have it on 
that other tape. I went there in 63 and I left in 73.

20:45.271 --> 20:50.315
73, working with minority children all this time 
or both? Both. I went then over to the Colonies

20:51.436 --> 20:59.343
North, the Butter District, but I still had the 
same problems. Oh, I know. But I don't, I feel so

21:02.146 --> 21:06.856
much enriched. They gave me a sense of feeling that 
I had opened the door for them and made them feel

21:15.595 --> 21:19.864
better. Yeah. And you know, that's just worth a lot 
to anybody. Oh, it is. It is. Now, you learned to

21:26.037 --> 21:28.142
speak Spanish, too. Yes, I learned to speak 
Spanish and I taught Spanish. Yeah. I taught...

21:33.112 --> 21:38.443
You didn't feel like it was a burden to learn 
Spanish so you could teach it, did you? You felt it

21:38.624 --> 21:39.726
was important? I thought it was very important. I 
think it is important today. And let me tell you,

21:43.815 --> 21:50.910
we're the only nation in the world that doesn't 
have two languages taught. The only one. And I

21:52.433 --> 21:53.876
think it's wrong. We need a second language. We do. 
And I'm proud that I can talk enough German to get

21:58.325 --> 22:01.251
by. I'm happy. You speak German, you speak 
Spanish, you speak English. That's right. I'm

22:06.882 --> 22:07.524
happy. I have my pen in there from... When

22:13.055 --> 22:31.634
you talk about ranching being a labor of love, you 
love your land, you love your stock, and you enjoy

22:13.055 --> 22:31.634
doing what you're doing. And I don't care where you 
would, my father would take me, he would always

22:32.114 --> 22:43.045
say, look at the land. and get your bearings, you 
came this way. And if you're lost, see what kind of a

22:48.783 --> 22:52.969
tree this is. Is it bent over? Is it straight? Is it a 
mesquite? We didn't have any mesquites in this

22:57.957 --> 23:01.162
country back in 1900. There wasn't any mesquites. 
Right. Well, all right. We had one mesquite on

23:06.651 --> 23:10.737
1,500 acres. Today, we're poisoning mosquitoes 
on the same land. I want to ask, right, yeah. Why? I

23:20.489 --> 23:21.650
know it's true. The beans are very, very rich in 
protein. And the cattle eat them. The goats eat

23:28.739 --> 23:29.681
them. The horses eat them. Everything eats them. 
But. It doesn't destroy it. And they come back up.

23:38.079 --> 23:40.902
They pass through, they're germinated, and they 
come up. And we never get rid of them. Never. I

23:45.727 --> 23:50.572
wanted to ask you, what about the grass fires? You 
know, the ones that spread all across the state and

23:50.872 --> 23:55.337
burn for ever and ever? For miles and miles. We've 
had one couple in our county this year, which...

24:03.687 --> 24:11.159
was a misfortune and it was merely an accident. 
Really it was. The wind, it was out and everything,

24:12.802 --> 24:19.953
or they thought it was out for a couple of days. But I 
know that the average person that I would talk to

24:21.095 --> 24:29.188
don't know what spunk wood is. But we have it in this 
country. And spunk wood is. And spunk wood kept

24:34.758 --> 24:43.972
burning just barely a little at a time, just enough 
to keep it warm. Then the wind changed and blew this

24:44.272 --> 24:49.320
spunk wood, as we call it, into grass then it got 
started and away it went and we certainly had a

24:50.228 --> 25:14.937
grass fire here that destroyed thousands and 
thousands of acres and fences but when I lived on

24:50.228 --> 25:14.937
the ranch and this is the first time and I've been 
living here since 1912

25:16.182 --> 25:25.555
And this is the first time that I've ever seen a fire 
that lingered as long as this one here. Yeah, I

25:25.575 --> 25:26.476
heard about it. And it was bad. But people, when you 
talk to them about spunk wood, they laugh at you.

25:34.166 --> 25:41.015
But it's just old, rotten wood that really hasn't 
all decayed. And...

25:45.697 --> 25:53.247
But it has enough life in it that when it is fired, it 
stays alive. It stays alive and alive and alive.

25:56.532 --> 25:58.214
Almost like peach bogs. Absolutely. And it is the 
hardest stuff in the world to put out. And that's

26:02.319 --> 26:05.123
exactly what happened. Well, I know that the 
pioneers talk about seeing these fires come and

26:05.322 --> 26:19.197
that settlers here fought and fought and fought 
because these things just swept the Great Plains

26:05.322 --> 26:19.197
for years. Sure they did. I have my grandmother's 
diary here and up there on the old ranch. It says

26:26.145 --> 26:32.292
that the grass was up to the horse's stomach. 
That's very true. We have grass in wet years on that

26:34.500 --> 26:45.336
place up there because it was a spring and it was 
sub-irrigated all the way down and all around that

26:45.637 --> 26:55.557
40 acres that we sold to the park was all 
sub-irrigated from that spring. And when we dug

26:56.319 --> 27:06.700
that spring out in 1926,

26:56.319 --> 27:06.700
we dug up many, many bones of cattle. Oh, I mean of 
cows and horses and mules. We knew what kind of

27:11.413 --> 27:15.840
bones they were because naturally we had seen 
them. And lots of animals. What I mean by that, fox

27:17.963 --> 27:22.029
and squirrel. You can tell a red bone where it comes 
from, what type of animal it is in a red bone. Now,

27:29.540 --> 27:34.948
you may not understand what I mean by red bone 
animals. But they do have a red bone. A squirrel is a

27:38.724 --> 27:40.305
red bone animal. Oh, really? That's right, if you 
don't believe me. Well, that's true. And that's

27:46.932 --> 27:54.400
the thing that I don't understand about people 
today. But I guess it's because they have never

27:54.840 --> 28:00.666
been told. No, they've never been told. And 
they've never had to know these things. But I was

28:07.231 --> 28:12.603
told when I was quite small about red bone animals. 
In fact, they didn't insist that you eat them. Oh,

28:18.356 --> 28:19.299
really? That's right. But during the Hoover days, 
I ate plenty of red bone animals. A lot of squirrel?

28:27.295 --> 28:28.457
A lot of squirrel. You betcha. I have too, I know. 
And they'll tell you that jackrabbits are no good.

28:33.823 --> 28:36.347
They'll tell you that cottontails are no good. But 
if that were the truth, I'd be dead today. That's

28:40.993 --> 28:42.434
all you had to eat. My mother would say,

28:42.494 --> 28:47.661
no meat in the house. If you want meat today, you've 
got to get it. Right. Well, I want to tell you one

28:51.929 --> 28:53.451
thing. We didn't have money to buy bullets. So how 
do you think we got them? I don't know. Tell me.

29:00.883 --> 29:04.829
Well, you don't say it today because that's awful. 
We killed him with a nigger shooter. But they tell

29:08.736 --> 29:10.619
you a slingshot. Well, a slingshot is two long 
strings of... with a piece of leather in

29:15.655 --> 29:24.210
connecting it, and you sling it around like that 
and let her fly. But a nigger shooter is made with a

29:24.891 --> 29:28.597
stock. Now, it's called that because of what it was 
used for. That's right, but if you say a nigger

29:31.943 --> 29:35.690
shooter today, they just give you them. Well, I 
think that in American history, we need to know

29:35.850 --> 29:40.498
that it was used to... keep people in the fields, 
right? That's exactly what it was used for. It was

29:45.483 --> 29:51.894
to, I'm looking at you, and you're picking cotton, 
and you're my slave, right? That's right. Now,

29:53.217 --> 29:55.741
that's something that people don't want to face. 
They don't want to face it, but that is the bare

29:55.781 --> 29:59.027
fact. That's what it is. And so help me goodness, 
they don't know why it was called a nigger shooter.

30:04.178 --> 30:07.365
But that's bare facts, and that is exactly right. 
Well, it's our American historical shame coming

30:07.445 --> 30:13.579
out again, but it's the reality that that's what it 
was. I like that little Dutch boy. I ain't got much

30:15.343 --> 30:17.387
shame here. That's truth, and they don't know it. 
That's an artifact of American history. And

30:23.557 --> 30:25.780
people need to know why. Well, I was called up on the 
carpet because I picked it up off the bed, and I

30:25.800 --> 30:35.154
said, this is a nigger shooter, and Lennon was as 
good with a nigger shooter as the next one. Lennon

30:35.174 --> 30:39.481
had an acrid eye, and don't let anybody kid you. He 
was good with a nigger shooter. He was good. with a

30:42.646 --> 30:47.033
gun, and don't let them ever tell you that he 
couldn't shoot. Because it became a device for

30:47.053 --> 30:51.199
hunting as a weapon. I think that sounded right. 
That's right. We used it. We didn't have money to

30:55.827 --> 31:00.013
buy bullets with, and we used this nigger shooter. 
And we used a slingshot. And a slingshot was what

31:02.918 --> 31:05.822
David killed Goliath with. That's exactly right. 
It's a sling, and it's a slide shot. And we had to

31:09.949 --> 31:14.015
have a certain type of rock for that. And there's 
plenty of rocks, but you'd fill your pockets full

31:14.416 --> 31:19.925
of them. We'd kill them in your squirrel with a 
slingshot.
