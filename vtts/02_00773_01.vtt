WEBVTT

00:01.111 --> 00:02.112
This is Debra Beale. I am interviewing Mr. Fred J. 
Benson on the history of Texas Engineering

00:02.713 --> 00:08.340
Experiment Station. The date is June 5th, 1984.

00:16.410 --> 00:29.245
And the other

00:16.410 --> 00:29.245
interview you gave us in the background, we don't 
really need to go into that all again, unless you

00:16.410 --> 00:29.245
want to. but I'd like to

00:29.900 --> 00:46.777
know what your first assessment

00:29.900 --> 00:46.777
was of this place. Well, when I first came here as a 
graduate student back in 1935 or 1936, the permit

00:46.877 --> 00:55.806
station was the responsibility of Mr. Giske was

00:56.647 --> 01:08.063
the college architect.

01:08.303 --> 01:15.814
Mr. Giske was

01:08.303 --> 01:15.814
very much interested in ventilation and heating 
and that sort of thing. They were doing a lot of

01:15.834 --> 01:16.815
research work back then. primarily

01:19.698 --> 01:42.355
on TV and that sort of thing. So you got involved as a 
grad student? No, I wasn't particularly involved

01:43.156 --> 01:43.977
in it. I knew about it, but I was quite friendly with 
seven guys who were working on it. And we basically

01:45.800 --> 01:46.542
left the university. T.R. Scramps came

01:47.542 --> 02:09.150
in, and he had due respect to the experiment 
station, and he was also responsible for the

01:47.542 --> 02:09.150
University's building program. And Mr. 
Gilchrist was the Dean of Engineering at the time,

02:09.170 --> 02:11.052
and he was very much interested in freight

02:12.955 --> 02:36.381
rates, in

02:12.955 --> 02:36.381
fact felt that the state of Texas was being 
discriminated against, and we established new

02:12.955 --> 02:36.381
freight rates, so we had a rather substantial 
project to carry on, so freight rates to and from

02:12.955 --> 02:36.381
the Texas courts destination

02:37.542 --> 03:03.266
and origin in comparison with similar 
commodities and similar lengths of trips in other

02:37.542 --> 03:03.266
parts of the country. We also had another fairly 
large project in the study of bridges, which was

03:03.286 --> 03:05.068
carried on by Now

03:06.162 --> 03:23.342
the freight

03:06.162 --> 03:23.342
rate study, when did that finally wind down? 
Because that went on for years. Yes, it did. I would

03:28.088 --> 03:29.470
guess it probably ended sometime in the early 50s. 
And out of that group, Originated

03:31.441 --> 03:43.518
in the group of Belvedere, Illinois, as well as 
Texas. That's the same group. And that still

03:45.400 --> 03:45.841
exists. So the industrial survey is what grew out 
of the freight rail study? Presumably. If you

03:50.848 --> 03:59.680
really want to pursue that phase of it, you've got 
to go talk to Jim Bradford. Go to Jim Bradford.

04:00.301 --> 04:00.621
Potential terms. And I think we started back in

04:03.048 --> 04:15.104
the late

04:03.048 --> 04:15.104
40's around Jim Randall. Were

04:15.245 --> 04:20.272
you involved in TEAS as a professor before? I 
really wasn't involved in TEAS directly until

04:20.292 --> 04:27.942
after World War II when we began to do I've

04:28.698 --> 04:53.887
done a fair amount of research work in civil 
engineering in the Highway Pavement field. I've

04:53.907 --> 04:54.508
done work with a lot of . In the Highway Pavement, 
TTI was established in 55. Was that something that

04:55.569 --> 04:57.051
the state came to the university and said we want? 
No, the Transformation

04:58.398 --> 05:22.414
Institute was an idea

04:58.398 --> 05:22.414
of Mr. Gilchrist, who was at that time the 
Chancellor, and a man who was for many, many years

04:58.398 --> 05:22.414
the Chief of the Bureau of Public Works, McDonald.

05:26.748 --> 05:49.575
They felt

05:26.748 --> 05:49.575
that there should be more

05:26.748 --> 05:49.575
cooperation between the major universities

05:26.748 --> 05:49.575
in the states and the state power departments to 
solve the problem of the climate system. And so

05:49.595 --> 05:52.418
they decided that Texas was a good place to try this 
out and see if they could start it here. And

05:53.258 --> 06:17.744
Ms.

05:53.258 --> 06:17.744
Skelter's

05:53.258 --> 06:17.744
got that legislation passed by the legislature, 
and it was pretty adept at being in the legislature

05:53.258 --> 06:17.744
back in the early 50s. It was a deal that we did, and 
it kind of came about in 1954-55. McDonnell

06:19.066 --> 06:21.308
retired from the Bureau of Public Roads and came 
down here and was on our staff for a number of years.

06:23.532 --> 06:40.156
And they

06:23.532 --> 06:40.156
started

06:23.532 --> 06:40.156
the corporate

06:23.532 --> 06:40.156
forum.

06:40.176 --> 06:48.467
And how did you get into

06:40.176 --> 06:48.467
the position of Vice Director of TEAS? Well, I 
started out with TTI. It came to me when somebody

06:49.769 --> 06:52.493
younger looked after the business side of this 
operation and somebody who was familiar with the

06:49.769 --> 06:52.493
university. system

06:52.743 --> 07:10.362
in the

06:52.743 --> 07:10.362
University of the People. They made me an 
executive officer in the Transformation

07:11.583 --> 07:14.846
Institute. I was a professor of civil engineering 
there. So I was at the same time an administrator

07:16.228 --> 07:18.210
for the Transformation Institute on half-time 
wages. And we

07:18.848 --> 07:34.608
started, essentially,

07:18.848 --> 07:34.608
with nothing. We built that program, and actually 
we had a real feud with the Engineering and Sperm

07:34.628 --> 07:45.521
Station, because the Highway Department was 
doing a little bit of work through the Engineering

07:34.628 --> 07:45.521
and Sperm Station, and they moved it over to the 
Transportation Institute. Art Mello, who was the

07:45.541 --> 07:47.944
advice director of the station, Dean was always 
the director, and he was very unhappy about that.

07:48.430 --> 08:06.777
That's

07:48.430 --> 08:06.777
why he left? That was one of the reasons he left. The 
real reason he left, I guess, was the fact that he

08:07.538 --> 08:09.621
had gone to Calhoun, and he said, I know, I know. He 
was the kind of one who had an aggressive program.

08:10.723 --> 08:10.983
What program? Aggressive program that he was 
willing to carry on. And

08:13.827 --> 08:33.671
director Rose, who came right before you? No, 
after me. Right, in terms of right before you

08:36.515 --> 08:41.881
became director? No, after me. Oh, okay. The metal 
left. Dr. Kalzin came to me and wanted me to take

08:43.848 --> 09:08.802
on

08:43.848 --> 09:08.802
the job of, again, Vice Director of the Experiment 
Station along with me and the Executive Officer of

08:43.848 --> 09:08.802
TTI. I didn't really want to do it, but I finally 
agreed to it. And I became then the Vice Director of

09:10.565 --> 09:12.808
the Experiment Station and the Executive Officer 
of TTI at the same time. John

09:14.324 --> 09:40.369
was, of course, a very aggressive

09:14.324 --> 09:40.369
individual, and they were working on the plans for 
the nuclear science center, trying to get it

09:14.324 --> 09:40.369
developed, and closing the loop

09:14.324 --> 09:40.369
and wind tunnel, and affecting a useful piece of 
equipment. Then they changed the format of the

09:40.389 --> 09:42.171
general administration here, I

09:44.497 --> 10:09.573
went back to the system organization, which they 
had dropped. I got in the team. I was the vice

10:09.973 --> 10:10.795
president for engineering. I forgot what the 
title was. And they wanted me to be dean of

10:11.395 --> 10:12.958
engineering, so I became dean of engineering. And 
I was always very involved with the team. The

10:14.500 --> 10:36.452
director of the Experiment Station. Was he here at 
the University before that? No, he was not. He was

10:37.654 --> 10:38.355
only here about a year back. Well, he wasn't here 
very long. I thought it was longer than that

10:39.016 --> 10:40.238
because Mr. Rutter came and in the spring of 58.

10:53.114 --> 11:04.987
He

10:53.114 --> 11:04.987
became dean in December of 57. And Carter became 
the vice president. Sometime later, and I don't

11:05.768 --> 11:09.972
remember exactly when it was, they made him 
president of the university, kept the system in

11:05.768 --> 11:09.972
resignation, but they moved the experiment 
stations and the extension services for

11:10.795 --> 11:34.760
administrative purposes of the university. And 
when they did that, Dr. Calhoun essentially got

11:34.780 --> 11:36.122
out of the job. And he went to the Bureau of the 
Interior with our science advisor for three or

11:36.142 --> 11:39.385
four years, and then he came back and worked as a 
vice chancellor for our parents. Did Rose leave

11:41.153 --> 11:55.489
because of greater pastors or because

11:41.153 --> 11:55.489
of the difference in... He was upset about the 
change in military. Was it

11:57.751 --> 12:03.218
a change in the direction he saw T's going? I think 
so, yes. He just felt that they were trying not to

12:03.578 --> 12:09.945
continue the same policies that had been followed 
So

12:10.583 --> 12:36.772
when

12:10.583 --> 12:36.772
he left,

12:10.583 --> 12:36.772
then Mr. Rudner wanted me to again become Director 
of Experiment Center, which I did. From that time

12:36.792 --> 12:38.694
on then, I was responsible for all of the 
engineering activities until 1978. That's what a

12:38.714 --> 12:39.915
lot of the sources, most of them said you were 
continuously director, but a few things,

12:40.267 --> 12:52.706
including a Houston Post article I saw, said that 
Dr. Cahan was director. I was the research

12:52.726 --> 12:53.487
manager. I saw an article that said he was named. I 
had much time with the research manager. He was

12:57.653 --> 12:59.596
with the research manager. Much rather didn't 
like the way he ran it, so he made me director of it,

12:59.616 --> 13:04.644
too. All for a while. Did they... essentially

13:08.363 --> 13:20.922
become

13:08.363 --> 13:20.922
one administrative organization? The Research 
Foundation really is a separate corp for

13:20.942 --> 13:28.113
me. For

13:28.133 --> 13:32.700
a while, he didn't really want fire to go on, so what 
he did was to make him the

13:33.085 --> 13:57.216
vice-director or something of the experimental 
section in the meeting, something that kind of

13:33.085 --> 13:57.216
eased out. He decided that he wanted to talk about 
it, so he might be working on it. It's not a very

13:58.717 --> 13:59.378
similar position. How did President Rutter 
change the way he changes policies or goals? Mr.

14:01.655 --> 14:11.108
Rutter wasn't, wasn't one to tell you how to do 
things. What he did was give you a job and expect you

14:11.349 --> 14:16.356
to get on with it. As far as the policies were 
concerned, he was the only guy that could obey the

14:16.616 --> 14:24.507
rules and get into anybody's hair too much while I 
ran suit and set. So

14:27.372 --> 14:50.099
the policies that we had, pretty much the policies 
that we developed inside of our engineering

14:27.372 --> 14:50.099
community, between myself and the department. 
Did you find that Sputnik and all the signs of the

14:50.119 --> 14:52.722
education bill after launching changed the tease 
out of it all, or defunded it?

14:55.874 --> 15:04.024
I would say yes,

14:55.874 --> 15:04.024
it did both. Probably had more effect on funding

15:04.084 --> 15:19.463
than it did on what we were trying to do. After 
Sputnik, the federal funding for science and

15:19.483 --> 15:24.008
engineering research and development 
increased, so there were a great many more sources

15:19.483 --> 15:24.008
of funds, and the fellows who had ideas had

15:24.393 --> 15:36.758
much more opportunity to get them exported than 
they had before them. Back in the early years,

15:36.778 --> 15:37.980
1940s and 1950s, Essentially,

15:38.770 --> 15:58.693
there was very little federal funding available 
to normal universities. There were special

15:58.713 --> 16:01.116
activities like the University of California 
operations, places like that, MIT, Lincoln

15:58.713 --> 16:01.116
Laboratories. As

16:01.940 --> 16:25.402
far as general funding available, the federal 
government doesn't exist. So the early programs

16:25.422 --> 16:29.986
were rather involved entirely on what funds you 
could get from the state of Texas and the work that

16:25.422 --> 16:29.986
we did for the private industries of the state and 
the highway department, of course, and the TTI

16:25.422 --> 16:29.986
program. That was a very substantial program for 
us. The wind tunnel you mentioned earlier, is that

16:31.302 --> 16:37.749
the same wind tunnel they're using now? The wind 
tunnel was originally built with a concrete

16:37.769 --> 16:48.420
section that was open to both ends. And the tunnel 
at that time had very, very little value. It had

16:54.206 --> 16:55.167
very little control. We got about

16:57.965 --> 17:21.272
the same amount of money out

16:57.965 --> 17:21.272
of the University Community Welfare Fund. and

17:22.079 --> 17:42.428
also put it in the balance system at that time. So 
it's been improved over the years, it seems? It's

17:43.409 --> 17:44.992
been improved some since the balance system was 
installed back in the 50s. It was originally for

17:45.012 --> 17:45.893
agriculture airplanes. Well, no, it was a general 
low speed wind tunnel.

17:54.259 --> 18:03.832
They used it a lot for their aggregate

17:54.259 --> 18:03.832
plane test,

17:54.259 --> 18:03.832
but we used it for other things. The biggest 
problem we had at that time was with insertion and

18:03.852 --> 18:08.178
expulsion. But they were more interested in the 
problems involved in spraying chemicals

18:12.333 --> 18:18.420
Dispersion solids and that sort of thing. It did 
that work with full-scale

18:18.440 --> 18:23.967
airplanes and feet. One of the other research 
areas that was big in the 50s but kind of dropped off

18:23.987 --> 18:37.264
was the architectural research in ventilation. 
That work was started under Dr. Mello. And

18:43.265 --> 18:56.903
it sensed that he was the brainchild of Bill 
Cordell, who was an

18:43.265 --> 18:56.903
architect at that time. And they worked on some of 
the same things that Gieske had

18:56.923 --> 19:04.494
worked on. Natural elevation, lighting, they 
worked on lighting, they worked on beam. air

19:08.662 --> 19:18.634
conditioning

19:08.662 --> 19:18.634
was just beginning to come in in those days. And 
then that program later shifted over and they did a

19:18.654 --> 19:37.977
lot of work

19:18.654 --> 19:37.977
for the

19:18.654 --> 19:37.977
military in the general

19:18.654 --> 19:37.977
area of protection of buildings from radiation 
problems in the latter few years. in this area, and

19:39.205 --> 19:42.191
most of that work was classified. That's the 
problem. I had to find out a lot of what was going on

19:47.000 --> 19:53.674
in the 60s because so much of the output is 
classified. But the work of Caudill and his people

19:53.694 --> 20:00.387
there was actually poor. There's

20:01.548 --> 20:16.983
a lot of reinventing the wheel going on in this 
country today. We're going to be going back to St.

20:17.003 --> 20:20.626
Petersburg. And he went in a private... Yes, he and 
two other fellows, a member of the staff over

20:21.207 --> 20:27.893
there, one of our graduate students, started an 
architectural firm here in Bryan, William Ralph

20:21.207 --> 20:27.893
and Scott,

20:21.207 --> 20:27.893
and they became... from a substantial firm

20:28.548 --> 20:43.368
in a fairly short

20:28.548 --> 20:43.368
period of time, about five, six, eight years. And 
then they moved their business to Houston, and

20:43.549 --> 20:51.399
they're still active in Houston now. And Rowlett 
are both gone. Wally Scott is still there, as far as

20:51.960 --> 20:52.861
I know. That sort of lost track of the people who did 
the, you know, the search work for them. There's

20:56.527 --> 21:19.855
an

20:56.527 --> 21:19.855
awful lot of people to keep track of. Besides 
President Rutter, is anyone else, and he was here

21:19.875 --> 21:23.860
for so long during that great spur of development, 
is anyone else in terms of President or Chancellor

21:19.875 --> 21:23.860
had a great impact on the re-operation? His impact 
being who left you alone to do it. Well, Mr. Rutter,

21:24.801 --> 21:25.622
of course, always said, was

21:26.834 --> 21:50.903
very

21:26.834 --> 21:50.903
supportive of anything that we wanted to do in the 
developmental area. And Williams also was

21:50.923 --> 21:52.165
supportive in that respect. He was never 
interested in the work that we were doing in the

21:52.185 --> 21:53.887
engineering department. It was his field of 
liberal arts. I

21:55.606 --> 22:18.235
didn't know very much about it, but the work 
developed quite well in the period when William

21:55.606 --> 22:18.235
was Chancellor. Probably one of the reasons for 
that is at that time Calhoun was, or they called

22:18.255 --> 22:20.938
him, they changed the titles all the time, but he 
was You

22:21.948 --> 22:40.551
see, Mr. Rutter and Dr. Williams were both 
Chancellor and President of the California Board

22:21.948 --> 22:40.551
of Supervisors. I think they called the Calhoun 
Dean of the Faculty. Maybe he was the Vice

22:44.456 --> 22:46.639
President later. Anyway, he had the same job as 
Eaton and Phillips put together. And

22:50.635 --> 23:16.531
were there any big, your other interview you said 
that the 70s was a time of organizing all that had

22:50.635 --> 23:16.531
been done in the 60s and just developing that 
further. Were there any big new projects that you

23:16.551 --> 23:17.993
were thinking about in the 70s?

23:21.652 --> 23:44.364
Well,

23:21.652 --> 23:44.364
in the

23:21.652 --> 23:44.364
70s, of course, we started the space program. I 
guess in the 70s, we primarily developed our

23:44.384 --> 23:46.006
remote sensing program in the 70s. Was there any of 
the space program in the 60s? There probably was

23:46.968 --> 23:47.729
some. I think probably the big development in the 
space program was late 60s, early 70s.

23:53.697 --> 24:17.373
We

23:53.697 --> 24:17.373
started our solid-state electronics program. I 
guess, again, we began that in the 60s with the

24:17.393 --> 24:19.336
major development in that arena within the 70s. 
And the transportation is due, of course. We began

24:20.197 --> 24:20.918
our highway safety program. And again, that was 
started back in the early to middle 60s, I guess. it

24:22.537 --> 24:45.730
probably made

24:22.537 --> 24:45.730
its greatest advances in the 70s.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.933
Since then, what happened in the 70s, a lot of what 
we had started earlier, more or less, came with

24:45.750 --> 24:47.933
maturity. Did you have, most of the 60s were 
contracted? Most of everything was contracted.

24:49.915 --> 24:50.316
So were the findings Besides

24:50.971 --> 25:13.795
those

24:50.971 --> 25:13.795
things that were classified for defense reasons, 
there wasn't much that wasn't classified? There

25:13.815 --> 25:14.575
wasn't much that was classified. The only thing 
that I can remember is doing the classified arena

25:14.595 --> 25:17.198
after the work that we were doing on radiation was 
in geophysics. and

25:18.342 --> 25:41.222
quite a lot of classified work in geophysics in 
terms of the detection of nuclear attacks. We did

25:41.242 --> 25:42.384
only a very, very small amount of classified work. 
The biggest thing was the steady growth of the

25:42.404 --> 25:43.506
program. When

25:44.549 --> 26:02.848
I started, I guess it was in the late 50s. It was 
probably 250. When I left, I guess it was quite

26:03.289 --> 26:04.091
early. I don't remember the exact date. Was

26:05.812 --> 26:27.617
most

26:05.812 --> 26:27.617
of the 60s

26:05.812 --> 26:27.617
government contract or private industry 
contract? Most of the 60s government contract.

26:28.378 --> 26:28.998
Did that change any in the 70s? Generally 
speaking, we did more work in private industry in

26:29.018 --> 26:30.841
the 70s than we had in the 60s. And then we began to 
also emphasize our relations with industry, both

26:30.861 --> 26:32.983
from the standpoint of the research teaching 
program so that we could make our program more

26:33.385 --> 26:47.923
sensitive

26:33.385 --> 26:47.923
to the real world. Was there a particular time 
period that this was an administrative decision

26:47.943 --> 26:58.136
to be delayed, or was this

26:47.943 --> 26:58.136
for them? Well, I think we probably decided in 
roughly 1970 that this was the direction in which

26:58.156 --> 27:01.080
we ought to go. And we also, of course, decided that 
engineering would probably move

27:03.119 --> 27:26.091
in the same way

27:03.119 --> 27:26.091
the law of medicine had, we would have essentially 
separate schools. That would be a mistake because

27:26.111 --> 27:27.353
I don't think it would happen. At least as far as our 
policies are concerned, they would be pointed in

27:27.373 --> 27:29.115
that direction. Based on that point. When did 
interdisciplinary research

27:34.085 --> 27:48.858
I don't

27:34.085 --> 27:48.858
remember.

27:49.559 --> 27:57.086
But must have

27:49.559 --> 27:57.086
come here in 58 or 59. So I would guess we started the 
Interdisciplinary Research Program in the

27:57.106 --> 27:59.708
1960s. And of course, it always had a rocky path. It 
still does to a large extent. Universities remain

28:03.451 --> 28:04.092
to this day. Apartments

28:06.552 --> 28:25.195
are too much for the shops, they don't talk to each 
other. And it's very difficult to cross those

28:25.215 --> 28:26.176
barriers. I've never quite understood why. Even 
in engineering it's sometimes difficult between

28:26.857 --> 28:29.320
mechanical, electrical, electrical, and 
industrial or civil mechanics.

28:33.603 --> 28:56.489
Is

28:33.603 --> 28:56.489
there a particular period in the

28:33.603 --> 28:56.489
history of tea since you've been here that you 
consider to be the low period? Well, the lowest

28:56.509 --> 28:57.991
period, as far as I'm concerned, is when I first 
started. We didn't have much program, and we

28:58.011 --> 29:00.133
didn't have very many people in there who were 
interested in research. Are

29:02.105 --> 29:31.504
there Any

29:31.855 --> 29:53.390
projects that you remember, any pet projects that 
you think should have been pursued in one of those?

29:53.410 --> 29:54.451
There were many over the years you would love to do. 
Well, there were lots of things that we would like

29:54.472 --> 29:56.655
to have done, but we couldn't find the support to do 
them. I don't know, several deaths. I've got the

29:57.276 --> 29:57.897
idea for instance. One of the

29:58.973 --> 30:21.780
solutions to the water

29:58.973 --> 30:21.780
problem here in Texas might be building the major 
nuclear reactors on the coast and use the salt

29:58.973 --> 30:21.780
water for cooling and evaporate the salt water and 
evaporate the water. To me, that's a fascinating

30:21.800 --> 30:23.402
scheme. I'm looking forward to it. Is

30:25.400 --> 30:42.542
that the 60s? Yes, we were on that end of the 60s. We 
were on that end of the 60s. But here again, this was

30:43.944 --> 30:45.446
all we did, which was preliminary studies on this. 
It became obvious that we were going to go against

30:45.466 --> 30:46.868
federal government.

30:52.670 --> 31:13.753
He operates

30:52.670 --> 31:13.753
on the charter that's in the legislation

30:52.670 --> 31:13.753
that created it. And as far as I know, that's the 
only The guidelines that it has are very general.

31:26.653 --> 31:45.330
Now,

31:26.653 --> 31:45.330
the key is the subject of all

31:26.653 --> 31:45.330
the rules and regulations of the university 
system. Essentially, its job is to do research,

31:45.350 --> 31:50.335
which is important for the state of Texas, and 
which will support the Texas economy and support

31:45.350 --> 31:50.335
the engineering activity and other activities 
here at the university. What do you think the role

31:51.698 --> 31:57.907
of TEAS is in terms of education? Well, the role of 
TEAS in education is to provide the faculty with

31:58.088 --> 32:15.394
opportunities to engage in research in which 
they're interested or to engage in these projects

31:58.088 --> 32:15.394
of interdisciplinary nature in which they may not 
be so interested.

32:18.985 --> 32:40.708
We use that to support

32:18.985 --> 32:40.708
graduate

32:18.985 --> 32:40.708
students and build up the faculty confidence and 
build up the store of the world of information on

32:18.985 --> 32:40.708
how we do things. And how do you feel teaching is 
responsible to disseminate the information?

32:43.491 --> 32:44.672
Well, certainly it has a responsibility to 
disseminate. the information

32:45.057 --> 32:53.926
and the question always is, how is this to be done? 
That's the most difficult job of all. You've got to

32:57.390 --> 33:00.974
get the information that you've developed out. 
You can do this through saying that your people get

33:00.994 --> 33:13.967
to technical meetings where their colleagues 
will know what they're doing here and publishing

33:00.994 --> 33:13.967
articles and research reports books, all sorts of 
things.

33:24.603 --> 33:38.804
I don't think that there were any years that I 
hadn't gone and built a book program, but we did a

33:24.603 --> 33:38.804
very good job and felt that was one of our weak 
links. It's been hard for me trying to pull the

33:39.806 --> 33:42.790
history together with a few publications, but I 
noticed that Lewis

33:43.411 --> 34:08.127
Horne, who apparently was... Lewis Horne came to 
work for a man who was a vice director before me. No.

34:08.227 --> 34:09.809
When he switched to TTI, he said everything kind of 
dropped off and everything. Get another man like

34:09.829 --> 34:10.330
him.

34:13.432 --> 34:23.241
The

34:13.432 --> 34:23.241
decision was made at that time. The department had 
felt that it was better for their people to publish

34:23.261 --> 34:36.334
in the open literature than it was for us to 
continue this series in which we published many of

34:23.261 --> 34:36.334
ourselves in our publications. I'm not so sure, 
but that was a wise decision. When you do that, the

34:40.178 --> 34:42.780
material becomes very scattered. Nobody

34:43.553 --> 35:03.824
takes

34:43.553 --> 35:03.824
responsibility for seeing

34:43.553 --> 35:03.824
that you have copies of the veil, that sort of 
thing. And I just doubt that that is as effective as

35:03.844 --> 35:06.768
the old bulletin circuitry. But then again, I 
don't know. It does not like me. In the 1972

35:08.511 --> 35:12.317
bulletin, there was another effort with the 
change in attitude in the 70s to take a new

35:08.511 --> 35:12.317
responsibility. In 1972? It

35:12.646 --> 35:20.302
was just a general news bulletin you sent out to 
industry and researchers. That was probably

35:20.322 --> 35:33.068
more in the order of an advertising piece to try to 
get more support from industry. really

35:33.335 --> 35:52.453
dissimilar type of thing. Oh, it's not technical, 
of course, in any sense, but it was kind of, we have

35:52.473 --> 35:54.956
some of this, and if you want it, we'll get it. When 
I, I mean, Dr. Porter, who took my place, this is one

35:54.976 --> 35:57.238
of the things that I told you that you should work 
on. I think you've done a pretty good job. I think

35:58.039 --> 35:58.799
you did a much better job now. We were doing a much 
better job. Did

36:00.773 --> 36:23.870
the Vietnam War have much of

36:00.773 --> 36:23.870
an effect on the direction some of your research 
was going? Really not. We never did get involved in

36:24.131 --> 36:25.192
classified work in 1944. Some of our people did. 
Some of our people worked in classified programs.

36:26.695 --> 36:27.456
They did this route just like Sam did.

36:30.541 --> 36:53.580
As

36:30.541 --> 36:53.580
far as the station is concerned, I don't remember 
anything. What about the strategic? Center for

36:54.121 --> 36:54.762
Strategic Technology? That came later. That was 
an idea that Dr. Thomas and I had, and I think that

36:55.122 --> 36:56.785
idea probably surfaced sometime

36:57.423 --> 37:18.233
along

36:57.423 --> 37:18.233
in the early or middle 70s. There were, of course, a 
large number of these think tanks around the

37:18.253 --> 37:21.778
country which had influenced the policy of like 
the minor corporations, grand corporations,

37:18.253 --> 37:21.778
like that. And these groups were either on the east 
coast or on the west coast. And we felt, by and

37:25.334 --> 37:48.451
large,

37:25.334 --> 37:48.451
that

37:25.334 --> 37:48.451
many of their studies were highly biased by their 
geographic location. And that there was room for a

37:48.471 --> 37:50.554
group which was really, had people in it who 
thought somewhat differently. And this was a good

37:50.574 --> 37:51.375
place for our panel. So we started out, got this 
approved by the board, and it was up and coming.

37:53.853 --> 38:14.873
been operating

37:53.853 --> 38:14.873
for about five or six years, and we are now 
beginning to have pretty substantial growth. The

38:14.893 --> 38:18.436
food protein program, is that out of the cotton 
seed? That's out of the old cotton seed products

38:18.456 --> 38:19.477
library. The Cotton Committee of Texas back 
somewhere in, oh, I guess in the late 30s, to

38:22.439 --> 38:44.540
convince

38:22.439 --> 38:44.540
the

38:22.439 --> 38:44.540
state of Texas that they

38:22.439 --> 38:44.540
ought to

38:22.439 --> 38:44.540
put in a parachute program in cotton. So they 
essentially

38:44.560 --> 38:49.605
divided that program into four units. The unit 
concerned with the use of cotton and the

38:49.625 --> 38:51.687
production of cotton crops along with the Texas 
Tech. Work on privacy was done here. The work on

38:59.278 --> 39:09.271
clothing and so on was done at what was then the 
Texas State College for Women in Denton. And the

39:09.291 --> 39:14.238
University of Texas had a very small program in the 
economic school. And programs don't very much

39:14.258 --> 39:16.341
exist that way. Spinning work and so on is still all 
done at Tech. The cottonseed work is done here. And

39:23.431 --> 39:41.074
the work on the use of cotton primarily in women's

39:23.431 --> 39:41.074
clothing is done up at, what do we call it now? TSCW? 
TW. TW. That's where I got my master's. And they

39:44.779 --> 39:46.902
produce some real beautiful things. But

39:48.113 --> 39:54.161
we changed the program. We changed the program and 
made it much broader than that. They now work with

40:00.910 --> 40:06.257
all kinds of .

40:06.277 --> 40:15.049
Essentially, the thrust of that program today is 
to develop local sources of . That was developed

40:15.687 --> 40:21.575
in the 60s, that expanded. Right. It was really 
gone under way when

40:21.735 --> 40:30.526
we brought Carl into it. I think he came probably 
somewhere

40:30.546 --> 40:36.094
in the late 60s. The fan test. It's been here 
forever. Fan testing was a part of the Easton

40:40.918 --> 40:44.402
program. I talked about that first. And since he 
was interested in ventilation and movement of

40:47.746 --> 41:02.745
air, it was pretty much natural for them to develop 
interest in performance of fans. And so we got some

41:02.765 --> 41:06.349
people over in the engineering department to work 
on this. And out of the work that they did,

41:08.995 --> 41:18.510
developed really the Fan Manufacturers 
Association in this country. And this laboratory

41:18.530 --> 41:31.610
which does the official fan tests and provides 
them with the information that they use in their

41:18.530 --> 41:31.610
advertisements.

41:31.630 --> 41:36.758
So where it started out to be a research 
laboratory, and in its early years, Did a lot of fun

41:37.160 --> 41:45.050
about

41:37.160 --> 41:45.050
researching fans. It is now a, I guess you would 
call it a regulatory factory. And produces, tests

41:50.577 --> 41:56.405
the fans and makes sure that the manufacturer's 
claims are. It's like a good housekeeping team.

42:00.069 --> 42:00.169
Yeah. Same thing for the fans. Except we

42:01.898 --> 42:10.065
do it all. The fan

42:10.366 --> 42:22.837
manufacturers

42:10.366 --> 42:22.837
don't even bother to do their own tests now. They 
send their fans in here and we make them make up the

42:22.857 --> 42:24.518
tables for them. It's a cheaper reading for each 
one of them. They have very fine stuff to sell. It

42:31.008 --> 42:40.861
has expanded some to consider fan noises and other 
elements of the system. But essentially

42:41.261 --> 42:51.635
it's a measurement

42:41.261 --> 42:51.635
laboratory. Although they know a lot about moving 
air. The cyclotron has always been interesting.

42:58.987 --> 43:18.536
A

42:58.987 --> 43:18.536
cyclotron was really sort of

42:58.987 --> 43:18.536
a funny, funny thing. Mr. Rutter called me up one 
day after a hot July day and said, I want you to go to

43:18.556 --> 43:21.961
Houston with me and talk to the Browns Foundation 
about cyclotrons. I knew barely what a cyclotron

43:21.981 --> 43:22.682
was. But

43:24.248 --> 43:44.140
we got in the car and

43:24.248 --> 43:44.140
went down and talked to the Welch Foundation, the 
Welch Foundation people. And they decided they

43:44.160 --> 43:46.124
would provide a million dollars for construction 
of the cyclotron. And they wanted A&M to take on the

43:46.144 --> 43:48.788
responsibility of getting the rest of the money 
and getting it built and getting it in operation.

43:53.577 --> 44:18.918
So

43:53.577 --> 44:18.918
when we got back, we heard from the other fellows 
who were in the field who were studying in the US.

44:18.938 --> 44:20.019
And they were smiling where I could get any 
attention. And we were looking at our salary,

44:20.039 --> 44:21.981
which at that time was going to cost, I think, about 
$300,000. All we had was better knowledge from the

44:22.001 --> 44:23.162
Welsh Foundation. And Mr. Rutter was pretty sure 
that he'd get the board to match that, but he didn't

44:24.155 --> 44:32.287
think he'd get any more than that, so that's too 
many numbers. And my people said, well, the best

44:32.307 --> 44:35.992
people. And cyclotrons of the size that we were 
planning to build are located at Lawrence

44:36.012 --> 44:45.185
Radiation Lab in Berkley. So we got the man who 
built their 88-inch cyclotron. to

44:49.889 --> 45:15.103
come here

44:49.889 --> 45:15.103
and advise us how we should proceed and give us some 
ideas of what we would do with the costs and

44:49.889 --> 45:15.103
operational expenses and that sort of thing. And 
we did a report from Mr. Rudder and the board and

45:15.704 --> 45:17.606
they decided they wanted to go on with it if we could 
raise the money. The Welch Foundation people had

45:17.626 --> 45:18.968
done some preliminary work with the At that time Al 
Ludeke was

45:19.707 --> 45:39.914
the general manager of the Atomic Energy 
Commission and one of our graduates of course. So

45:39.935 --> 45:44.160
we went to Pierce, who was their research manager, 
and he encouraged us to go on. And he essentially

45:44.180 --> 45:45.462
was responsible, I expect, along with Ludeke. for 
getting the additional money put in the federal

45:45.678 --> 45:52.264
budget for us to build this type of thing. Now, 
after all of the legwork of the...
