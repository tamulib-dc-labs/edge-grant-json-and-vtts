WEBVTT

00:03.963 --> 00:07.406
And how their lives might forever be. Affected.

00:13.231 --> 00:13.631
By.

00:16.914 --> 00:17.174
Though. By those matters.

00:30.586 --> 00:33.328
I particularly also tried to. remind them that the 
completion of a degree was vital,

00:34.827 --> 01:03.467
that while a few of them might have a chance

00:34.827 --> 01:03.467
of playing in the National Football League, that 
there were more

00:34.827 --> 01:03.467
that The numerical odds

01:04.392 --> 01:18.353
of that

01:04.392 --> 01:18.353
were certainly not very likely.

01:23.822 --> 01:33.336
To the black students, I tried to alert them by 
noting that every year there were more black

01:34.885 --> 01:55.020
students graduating from law schools

01:34.885 --> 01:55.020
or medical schools

01:34.885 --> 01:55.020
than who played in the NBA, the NFL, and organized 
baseball.

02:06.712 --> 02:27.707
On one of those occasions, I remember chatting 
privately

02:06.712 --> 02:27.707
with a young man from Jasper, Texas,

02:06.712 --> 02:27.707
a superb running back.

02:48.292 --> 02:53.942
who seemed to have a marvelous future.

03:01.215 --> 03:12.055
I ask him if he had ever thought

03:01.215 --> 03:12.055
what he might do

03:17.587 --> 03:26.297
if his knee,

03:17.587 --> 03:26.297
if he had a severe injury to his ankle or knee.

03:30.442 --> 03:31.723
Instantly he stopped.

03:34.326 --> 03:39.893
Instantly he assured me that he had never been hurt 
and never would.

03:44.658 --> 03:47.121
When I pursued the point further and asked him But 
what if it did happen?

03:52.569 --> 04:00.197
He assured me that no one had ever before asked him 
to consider that reality.

04:07.505 --> 04:13.952
Later,

04:07.505 --> 04:13.952
after an all too brief career,

04:18.370 --> 04:20.473
with the Atlanta Falcons.

04:24.099 --> 04:28.445
He did have a severe knee injury, which terminated 
his playing days.

04:33.553 --> 04:44.530
Among the most

04:33.553 --> 04:44.530
delightful

04:33.553 --> 04:44.530
athletic memories, of course, are those related 
to Randy Matson, But I believe I put that on the

04:46.214 --> 04:49.479
other tape. If I have not, I will add those later.

05:01.478 --> 05:06.085
As the Ballard years progressed, the team began to 
win regularly.

05:10.832 --> 05:13.116
And the national rankings went higher and higher.

05:16.943 --> 05:28.876
Aggies began to dream of top 10 rankings

05:16.943 --> 05:28.876
and maybe even a national championship some year. 
And a national championship soon.

05:43.833 --> 05:45.735
We academics began to worry about graduation 
rates and whether or not athletes were given

05:46.981 --> 06:13.309
special breaks in the courses they took

05:46.981 --> 06:13.309
and the grade requirements

05:46.981 --> 06:13.309
in those

05:46.981 --> 06:13.309
classes.

06:26.772 --> 06:56.728
The climax

06:26.772 --> 06:56.728
of the Ballard years, following bowl games, 
winning records, came in a year in which the Aggies

06:26.772 --> 06:56.728
were highly rated in preseason rankings, open 
with victories over Kansas

06:26.772 --> 06:56.728
and Clemson, both of which were supposedly were 
very good teams.

07:06.397 --> 07:07.619
But the Aggies thrashed them.

07:12.344 --> 07:18.552
And by the end of the year, it was obvious that both 
squads were overrated.

07:22.677 --> 07:27.002
Then the Maroon team went to Houston to play the 
Cougars and the Astrodome and were thrashed. The

07:34.601 --> 07:57.782
following week, they came back to Kyle Field to 
play the Baylor Bears

07:34.601 --> 07:57.782
and lost a close game

07:34.601 --> 07:57.782
on a, quote, hideout play, quote, and what a number 
of critics thought

07:34.601 --> 07:57.782
was Superior coaching strategy.

08:04.659 --> 08:07.021
From the green and white or from the green and gold 
bench.

08:11.747 --> 08:12.228
Paragraph.

08:15.872 --> 08:18.996
Monday afternoon in the Koch building without any 
planning.

08:23.541 --> 08:26.245
Vice Presidents Prescott Vestal. Coldest and I

08:29.791 --> 08:50.700
without any prior planning ended up in Dr. 
Miller's office for one of our comparatively

08:29.791 --> 08:50.700
regular post-workday discussion sessions.

08:55.927 --> 08:59.612
Quickly, we mentioned the alumni frustration and 
anger that we heard after Saturday's game.

09:14.897 --> 09:18.462
Dr Miller indicated that he had perceived similar 
sentiments.

09:21.606 --> 09:29.397
And we told him that he had better get ready for a 
whole bunch of letters, phone calls and other

09:21.606 --> 09:29.397
pressure to get rid of Ballard, but that we hoped 
that he would resist that, those sentiments,

09:30.575 --> 09:48.919
because in our opinion, Coach Ballard was running 
an honorable, reputable, and quality program.

09:52.744 --> 10:00.514
And that while he was not going to win the national 
championship, he sure was doing better than the

09:52.744 --> 10:00.514
coaches we remember.

10:05.568 --> 10:24.406
In the middle of the conversation, Dr. Miller 
said, asked

10:05.568 --> 10:24.406
our opinion,

10:05.568 --> 10:24.406
Dr. Miller exclaimed, quote, but even if he wasn't 
the head coach, we'd want to keep him as the

10:05.568 --> 10:24.406
athletic director. Quote, dash, since in those 
days, the head football coach was also the

10:30.717 --> 10:31.918
director of athletics. We agreed that, yes, his 
opinion was correct, but that that wasn't the

10:34.361 --> 10:44.853
point, but it was keeping him as football coach, 
which really mattered.

10:48.898 --> 10:57.568
Paragraph, we were unaware that Steve Pringle, 
one of Dr. Miller's assistants, was standing in

10:48.898 --> 10:57.568
the doorway. and heard our conversation.

11:05.782 --> 11:19.020
Soon, either that evening or the next morning, he 
summarized the conversation

11:05.782 --> 11:19.020
to one of the campus's most respected student 
advisors, Dr. R.C. Potts, the Associate Dean of

11:19.080 --> 11:28.112
Agriculture, who had been, who had helped Steve 
for many years.

11:34.154 --> 11:58.521
Then Dr. Potts

11:34.154 --> 11:58.521
passed

11:34.154 --> 11:58.521
his summary of the conversation on to, and I can't 
remember this man's name, the

11:34.154 --> 11:58.521
chief, the director of Kane Hall the athletic 
dormitory, who had been the coach at Angelo Junior

11:58.771 --> 12:17.438
College back when Emory had been the head football 
coach at San Angelo High School.

12:17.458 --> 12:26.871
Then that close friend of Coach Ballard's

12:17.458 --> 12:26.871
discussed the Monday afternoon meeting With the 
head coach.

12:34.296 --> 12:35.078
And apparently.

12:38.603 --> 12:38.983
The. Facts of the discussion.

12:48.318 --> 12:51.743
Had gotten.

12:51.763 --> 12:52.784
Altered a great deal.

12:56.730 --> 12:57.752
As they passed. through that number, that quartet 
of hearers.

13:16.715 --> 13:29.612
Thus, on a Wednesday morning,

13:16.715 --> 13:29.612
at about 10.30 or so, I was stunned When President 
Miller

13:31.972 --> 13:49.327
hurried into my office

13:31.972 --> 13:49.327
looking pale and sounding excited as he 
exclaimed, Emory Ballard just resigned.

13:54.792 --> 14:01.118
He continued to say by saying that the coach had 
called just before coming over and asked for an

14:02.482 --> 14:09.870
opportunity to talk to President Miller 
immediately.

14:14.395 --> 14:30.852
Then when he came in, he indicated that he had 
understood that there had been a meeting at which

14:14.395 --> 14:30.852
Dr. Miller had discussed the termination, his 
termination, the coach's termination, with some

14:31.186 --> 14:32.868
of his key advisors. Dr. Miller tried to assure him 
that that was not a correct report

14:33.908 --> 14:49.823
and apparently mentioned in his summary that even 
if you were not our coach, I would still want you as

14:33.908 --> 14:49.823
the athletic director.

14:54.427 --> 15:01.193
That statement seemed to

14:54.427 --> 15:01.193
the worried visitor to confirm the reports he had 
heard and so he immediately expressed his

15:01.342 --> 15:30.403
resignation

15:01.342 --> 15:30.403
effective immediately and walked out

15:01.342 --> 15:30.403
paragraph I then tried to persuade Dr. Miller that 
he needed as quickly as possible to select a new

15:01.342 --> 15:30.403
head football coach When he asked why that must be 
done so rapidly. I tried to persuade him. Since he

15:41.601 --> 15:44.483
had no athletic experience.

15:47.046 --> 15:50.349
That football coaches that football teams. Did 
not operate without. A head coach.

15:58.536 --> 16:00.458
When he asked what his choices were. I told him that 
the obvious selection would be either the Chief

16:01.670 --> 16:14.189
Defensive Coordinator or Offensive 
Coordinator.

16:14.229 --> 16:29.331
The first of whom had compiled a good record but was 
the subject of some community criticism because

16:30.256 --> 16:35.544
of his operation of a liquor store at Southgate.

16:38.729 --> 16:45.379
Then Dr. Miller asked for an evaluation of the 
offensive coordinator, Tom Wilson.

16:49.024 --> 16:59.740
I gave him an affirmative endorsement, but noted 
that Coach Wilson

16:49.024 --> 16:59.740
had the disadvantages of being of a great 
disadvantage of being a graduate of Texas Tech and

17:01.711 --> 17:15.428
a former Red Raider quarterback.

17:15.448 --> 17:15.928
Paragraph. The result of the conversation became 
obvious about mid-afternoon when I happened to

17:16.629 --> 17:31.347
look out the window, west window of my office to see 
Tom Wilson and Marvin Tate walking back toward

17:32.508 --> 17:46.268
their offices at G. Raleigh White Coliseum,

17:32.508 --> 17:46.268
their feet barely touching the ground and each 
patting the other on the back. Marvin, having just

17:47.690 --> 18:01.890
been promoted from Associate Director of 
Athletics,

17:47.690 --> 18:01.890
Marvin, who had been doing most of the work of 
athletic director anyway. Now it was given that

18:04.835 --> 18:13.565
title of director of athletics and Tom Wilson 
became the head coach, the new head coach.

18:21.974 --> 18:28.722
The paragraph, the Wilson era got off to a fairly 
good start. And in the fall of 79, we ended

18:30.727 --> 18:44.082
up in a bowl game in Birmingham, Alabama. And I 
think maybe even won the game.

18:48.667 --> 18:54.513
And so there was optimism about football as we 
moved on to El Paso. Meanwhile, elsewhere in

18:56.736 --> 18:58.658
athletics, There was always noise

18:59.448 --> 19:09.984
and varying degrees of criticism and 
compliments. In basketball, Shelby Metcalf had

19:12.247 --> 19:25.067
been the head coach for a number of years, 
succeeding Bob Rogers in the early 60s.

19:27.933 --> 19:56.151
Shelby would probably say that he won nothing if he 
wasn't funny because he always had a quick

19:27.933 --> 19:56.151
and pleasant response filled with humor to any 
statement regardless of how positive or

19:27.933 --> 19:56.151
negative.

20:00.890 --> 20:09.261
He,

20:00.890 --> 20:09.261
in the late 70s, his teams were winning very well.

20:12.506 --> 20:23.080
And we used to look forward to playing the 
Longhorns

20:12.506 --> 20:23.080
and the Razorbacks.

20:23.100 --> 20:28.247
At this point, I can't remember the name of the 
colorful coach of Longhorns.

20:30.927 --> 20:34.191
But Eddie Sutton. Slick Eddie. To his former 
teammates at Oklahoma State.

20:42.161 --> 20:44.204
And later to his coaching competitors.

20:47.588 --> 20:48.910
Had moved Arkansas. Up near the top. When either. 
The orange

20:54.117 --> 20:58.302
horns. are the Redbacks, came to play at G. Raleigh 
White. The place was filled with enthusiasm and

21:06.684 --> 21:10.850
noise. In those days, they would introduce the 
visiting team and coaches first,

21:13.433 --> 21:26.550
and then the announcer would say, and now,

21:28.876 --> 21:31.098
The Texas Aggies. And we would try to see how long we 
could yell loud enough to drown out the PA system.

21:40.789 --> 21:45.594
One night against Arkansas that yelling went on 
for at least 10 minutes. And Eddie first became

21:47.496 --> 21:50.039
frustrated, then angry. And then so.

21:54.904 --> 21:55.525
Uh. wild in his anger that he ripped off his coat and 
threw it to the floor which of course added to the

21:57.850 --> 22:12.932
noise from the home crowd. Needless to say that 
evening the Aggies walked away with a winning

22:14.715 --> 22:19.742
score.

22:23.568 --> 22:24.870
There were countless

22:27.972 --> 22:28.893
There were countless. Shelby isms.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.164
But we were winning and I remember. And during 
spring break. Of 1980 1980. After

22:42.092 --> 22:51.946
we had been selected for the appointment at UTEP.

22:51.967 --> 22:54.150
And we went to visit El Paso. We stopped in Fortune 
Locton to spend the night on the way back.

23:00.946 --> 23:29.181
Our three sons and I went out into the station wagon 
and drove near the back of the parking lot where we

23:00.946 --> 23:29.181
could barely pick up the broadcast

23:00.946 --> 23:29.181
of the Aggie game against the Louisville 
Cardinals in what would have been the Sweet Eight

23:00.946 --> 23:29.181
tournament. And finally, in overtime,

23:30.680 --> 23:42.356
Louisville beat the Aggies and went on to win the 
NCAA championship.

23:42.376 --> 23:44.679
Their two remaining games were not as close. The 
margin of their victory was not as close as in the

23:46.682 --> 23:50.367
Aggie game. So those of us with maroon vision all 
wondered, about whether or not the Aggies would

24:00.380 --> 24:20.324
have won the NCAA championship in 1980 if

24:00.380 --> 24:20.324
they had been able to beat Louisville

24:00.380 --> 24:20.324
in that close game. Paragraph track was a big 
spectator sport in those days with the meets held

24:22.987 --> 24:30.336
in Kyle Field, where the oval ran around the 
football field.

24:41.032 --> 24:59.496
Among the individuals that attracted my closest 
interest was Ted Nelson,

24:41.032 --> 24:59.496
whom I had first seen in an amateur meet in Houston 
when Ted was a junior in high school I believe.

25:06.148 --> 25:27.880
And he and his mile relay teammates had come to run 
against the University of Houston team,

25:06.148 --> 25:27.880
which went on to score high to place well in the NCAA 
national meet.

25:32.298 --> 26:00.499
Ted, comparatively average in height, but filled 
with talent

25:32.298 --> 26:00.499
and more blessed, even more blessed with 
determination, ran a marvelous anchor and almost

25:32.298 --> 26:00.499
beat Olin Cassel, C-A-S-S-E-L-L, one of the best 
quarter milers in modern decades. He came on to A&M

26:02.251 --> 26:09.000
and was in one of my freshman history sections. 
There, just as in track, he demonstrated his

26:09.020 --> 26:27.123
tireless determination

26:09.020 --> 26:27.123
and always was trying to improve his grade through 
hard work.

26:27.143 --> 26:31.228
Then after graduation, he stayed on as an 
assistant coach

26:33.723 --> 26:50.803
And then finally

26:33.723 --> 26:50.803
was promoted to the head coach position, which he 
now handled, where

26:33.723 --> 26:50.803
he now serves with real distinction. He, for me, is 
another of those coaches that I would be proud to

26:52.885 --> 27:02.937
have as a role model. for one of our children.

27:08.831 --> 27:24.756
He always was kind, always setting a good example 
and always hoping to win with integrity.

27:28.769 --> 27:56.785
well let's see we left Kerrville about 10 or 15 
minutes ago and I'm now looking at my notes

27:28.769 --> 27:56.785
and I'm wondering if I have said anything in this 
about Ann Pittman who was my secretary for

27:58.537 --> 28:07.611
most of the 1970s.

28:11.537 --> 28:25.860
And a native of western Kentucky, comparatively 
diminutive in height,

28:11.537 --> 28:25.860
but standing very tall in capability, 
determination,

28:28.152 --> 28:40.450
and dedication to her task, came to College 
Station with her

28:28.152 --> 28:40.450
army husband and two little boys.

28:46.799 --> 28:55.392
Somewhere about the time that she joined me,

28:46.799 --> 28:55.392
her husband literally left her and the boys And so 
she became the primary breadwinner

28:57.127 --> 29:09.800
for them and herself.

29:09.820 --> 29:26.998
She always was a splendid

29:09.820 --> 29:26.998
asset to me and to the workforce

29:09.820 --> 29:26.998
and the larger office of the Vice President for 
Academic Affairs.

29:31.433 --> 29:49.430
Always ready to do the extra task, but never 
hesitant to give me candid, honest advice and

29:31.433 --> 29:49.430
counsel

29:31.433 --> 29:49.430
on the many occasions when I needed it.

29:53.113 --> 30:01.221
She seemed flawless in her typing,

29:53.113 --> 30:01.221
because in those days we were not yet on the 
computer. Thank goodness electric typewriters

30:02.905 --> 30:25.776
were available so that she could incorporate

30:02.905 --> 30:25.776
all of the many changes which I

30:02.905 --> 30:25.776
wanted to make in drafts of letters and speeches. 
Paragraph, I particularly remember how many

30:27.779 --> 30:32.305
times she typed my remarks for the last

30:32.842 --> 30:52.361
speech that I made at A&M, the commencement 
speech,

30:32.842 --> 30:52.361
one of the three commencement speeches in the 
spring of 1980. In those remarks, I attempted to

30:52.522 --> 31:01.110
use as my theme that The graduates and I all were 
beginning new lives. And

31:06.409 --> 31:18.340
that dash, hopefully dash, we would use 
everything we had learned up to that point
