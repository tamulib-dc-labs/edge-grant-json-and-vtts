00:04.874 --> 00:06.876
Okay, Ray. Okay, this is Ron Shorn interviewing 
Ray Newbern at Jet Propulsion Laboratory at

00:06.937 --> 00:14.446
Pasadena, California on June 16, 1993. Ray, for 
the record, what's your full name? Ray Leon

00:19.932 --> 00:25.099
Newbern, Jr. And where and when were you born? 
January 9, 1933, Rock Island, Illinois. Okay. How

00:32.007 --> 00:34.290
did you get interested in astronomy in the first 
place? I read a Sunday supplement in a newspaper

00:35.030 --> 00:51.590
when I was in the fourth grade, probably at that 
time, in the old Herald Examiner, except I guess it

00:35.030 --> 00:51.590
was the Herald Express in those days, before they 
combined with the Examiner. Got very excited

00:52.290 --> 00:55.554
about this article about the solar system. 
Started asking my folks questions. They didn't

00:57.537 --> 00:58.498
know the answers. Said, you know what you're 
supposed to do when you... want the answer to

01:01.996 --> 01:04.940
something, and we don't know the answer, go to the 
library. So I started reading books on astronomy,

01:04.980 --> 01:08.345
and the next thing I knew, I was hooked. Okay. Did 
you keep that interest in astronomy through high

01:10.609 --> 01:13.733
school? Yes, very much so. Where did you go to high 
school, by the way? Glendale High, Glendale,

01:16.998 --> 01:19.722
California. So where did you go to undergraduate 
school? Well, just tell me your schooling. I went

01:26.612 --> 01:30.838
to Caltech in September of 1950. Got my bachelor's 
degree there in 1954, a master's degree in 55. I did

01:36.819 --> 01:40.164
the coursework for a doctorate. And then in the 
summer of 56, I came to work at JPL rather than

01:41.286 --> 01:55.267
continuing as I had in a couple of previous summers 
at Mount Wilson Observatory because I was $3,500

01:41.286 --> 01:55.267
in debt and needed the money. JPL offered me twice 
as much money as Mount Wilson. So I came to work at

01:59.388 --> 02:05.076
JPL, and it turns out I never went back to school 
then. I stayed at JPL, been here just over 37 years

02:05.477 --> 02:09.062
now. What did JPL hire you to do? Well, the first job 
I did that I was really looking at seriously was the

02:13.889 --> 02:22.943
flame attenuation of electromagnetic 
radiation. They were still doing radio guidance

02:23.464 --> 02:29.192
in those days, and they were concerned about the 
radio signals for guidance being attenuated by

02:29.510 --> 02:31.532
the rocket plume. And so it was a problem in pure 
physics. There was no real astronomy here, and

02:34.496 --> 02:37.960
that's what I was doing that summer. Was that 
Sergeant or Corporal? Actually, in those days, it

02:42.385 --> 02:47.070
was, I think, a concern about both. Both were 
certainly... Corporal was in the field, and

02:48.332 --> 02:55.239
Sergeant was still under development.

02:57.081 --> 02:57.542
When did When did JPL start getting interested in 
astronomy? Well, the first action that I got

03:03.314 --> 03:25.656
involved in that was really astronomy occurred 
when Marsha Neugebauer and I wrote a series of

03:03.314 --> 03:25.656
articles, or articles, but just position papers 
on some of the things that we might do in space in

03:03.314 --> 03:25.656
early 1958.

03:26.193 --> 03:40.333
This was in response to Explorer 1 having gone up 
and people starting to think ahead as to what it

03:26.193 --> 03:40.333
might be possible to do with these newfangled 
rockets and space probes. And the result of that

03:41.455 --> 03:55.255
position paper, which was strictly an on-lab 
thing, was that I was made part of a Tiger team set up

03:41.455 --> 03:55.255
by Al Hibbs in the fall of 1958. to formally look 
into these problems of what should we do in our

03:55.623 --> 04:00.968
studies of the solar system. And this all finally 
resulted in Marsha and I writing the report 30-1,

04:01.468 --> 04:15.281
which was the formal report of Al Hibbs' Tiger 
Team, and we did the science section.

04:17.924 --> 04:22.288
Okay, did that report have any, did anything come 
out of that? Yeah, I mean, it was accepted by NASA,

04:23.332 --> 04:33.426
and I think it was widely used initially as a sort of 
an outline of the things we ought to be attempting

04:23.332 --> 04:33.426
to do in space. And it was very widely used and 
quoted for a few years until we began to try to do

04:34.227 --> 04:39.735
some of these things. Found some of them were a 
little harder than we thought. But actually, I

04:41.737 --> 04:46.123
think virtually everything in that report we 
finally did. Maybe not quite on the time scale we

04:46.304 --> 04:48.667
expected. Took a little longer, but we finally did 
it all. When did you get to be able to start to do some

04:53.723 --> 05:00.112
astronomy at JPL? Well, we created an astronomy 
group here in, I believe, 1961. People

05:08.444 --> 05:19.360
were convinced that we needed some astronomers 
around doing astronomy to maintain, I think,

05:19.829 --> 05:31.364
recognition in the field and to give proper advice 
and mostly we were concerned about the fact that

05:19.829 --> 05:31.364
there was almost no planetary astronomy going on 
in the United States in those days. We knew that we

05:31.845 --> 05:36.551
were going to need ground-based support of the 
space program. No one else seemed willing to do it

05:37.072 --> 05:46.444
so we got the idea well let's see what we can do in a 
small way ourselves and when a small 16-inch The

05:46.677 --> 05:49.662
telescope came on the market for, I believe, 
$8,000. It was for sale by a private party here in

05:50.143 --> 05:53.508
the basin. I talked the boss into buying it and 
housing it. In those days, it was Al Hibbs was the

06:00.319 --> 06:04.947
division manager. Fred Eimer was his deputy. And, 
gosh, who was the section manager? Shortly after

06:14.015 --> 06:17.420
that, Luke Kaplan came on board as the section 
manager. I think at the time this actually

06:17.500 --> 06:22.487
happened, it was probably either Herb Trostle or 
John Porter. Alright, so you got this 16-inch, and

06:23.969 --> 06:26.553
where'd you put it? We looked at several 
possibilities. I talked to Ira Bowen, and he had

06:30.158 --> 06:38.250
agreed that we could use a site just north of the 
100-inch dome on Mount Wilson. But, of course, we

06:38.483 --> 06:51.977
would have been distinctly visitors, and he said 
that their facilities were sufficiently loaded

06:38.483 --> 06:51.977
and water was short, and we'd have to bring in 
everything that we wanted to use and stay in the old

06:38.483 --> 06:51.977
Mount Wilson Hotel and what have you. We looked at 
Chileo, but we looked longest and hardest and

06:52.918 --> 07:01.928
finally went in to Table Mountain because the 
Smithsonian was just moving out. They had done

07:02.008 --> 07:05.031
solar constant work there for some... 25 or 30 
years I guess there were primitive facilities

07:05.872 --> 07:33.212
there already and the Forest Service was happy to 
have someone take over the site so we and of course

07:05.872 --> 07:33.212
we had seeing studies as well for the site since it 
had been one of the areas where Caltech had looked

07:05.872 --> 07:33.212
as a possible site for the 200 inch reflector and 
they found that it was as good as Palomar from the

07:05.872 --> 07:33.212
point of view of astronomical seeing And at that 
time, from the point of view of city lights, but it

07:33.496 --> 07:40.325
was very close to the San Andreas Fault. So they 
went to Palomar instead of to Table Mountain. But

07:43.248 --> 07:45.912
we had all those seeing studies, and we knew it was a 
good site. So we grabbed it.

07:51.759 --> 07:53.902
Who were the early people that were hired on? I 
guess Highspinrad was one of the earliest to come

07:53.942 --> 07:59.449
in after you formed your astronomical section. 
Highspinrad, Bob Youngkin. Yourself, Ron Shorn,

08:04.040 --> 08:08.946
were the first people that were involved. We hired 
a man by the name of Charles Cape, and he went by the

08:08.966 --> 08:25.508
name Chick, who would actually act as the on-site 
manager, supervisor, holder of hands, repairer

08:08.966 --> 08:25.508
of problems, and so on at the mountain. I know where 
High and I came from. Do you remember where Bob

08:28.984 --> 08:31.149
Youngkin came from? He was actually working on his 
doctorate at UCLA at the time. And he was married,

08:36.400 --> 08:40.027
family, and needed to work. And so he was just 
working on his doctorate in his spare time. And he

08:43.615 --> 08:47.884
did finally finish it years later. I guess you got 
interested in planetary astronomy right from the

08:48.573 --> 08:52.498
start, right? From the Sunday supplement? That's 
true. Although when I was a student at Caltech, my

08:54.841 --> 09:02.530
work and my interests lay mostly in galactic 
structure and cosmology. And my published work

09:03.311 --> 09:16.386
there, a major paper that I did, was on the RR Lyrae 
variables in NGC 4147, published in the AJ the year

09:03.311 --> 09:16.386
I came to work at the lab. But here of course the 
interest was in planetary and i loved astronomy

09:18.745 --> 09:46.052
generally so i at that time it was easily possible 
for a person to know everything there was to know

09:18.745 --> 09:46.052
about the field of solar system astronomy quite 
unlike today and so i just sort of made myself a

09:18.745 --> 09:46.052
universalist on the solar system uh back say in 
1958 or 1960 uh your opinion Did real, quote

09:46.252 --> 09:50.577
unquote, astronomers look down on planetary 
types? Very much so. Did you feel inferior? Not

09:54.741 --> 09:55.482
really, no. Because you were working on planets. I 
didn't think so. I thought that most of the

09:57.424 --> 10:12.360
attitude that astronomers had was because of a few 
unfortunate articles of people who tended to

09:57.424 --> 10:12.360
follow Percival Lowell's school of study of Mars 
and that The Sunday supplements, in fact, even

10:12.526 --> 10:21.196
though one is what attracted me to the field, had 
given the people who were interested in the solar

10:12.526 --> 10:21.196
system a bad name. But if one looked, one found 
people like G.P. Kuiper, who was doing good,

10:24.100 --> 10:26.222
reputable work. Of course, the people at Mount 
Wilson, like Dunham and Adams and Nicholson and

10:26.703 --> 10:38.196
Pettit, had done good work, solid physical, 
astrophysical work on the planets throughout the

10:26.703 --> 10:38.196
30s. And Kuiper picked it up in the 40s. And it was a 
perfectly good, honest field. It's just that it

10:45.773 --> 11:00.235
had gotten a little bit of a bad rep that people who 
didn't know too much about it tended to look at the

10:45.773 --> 11:00.235
infamous Lowellian school of the solar system 
instead of the solid physical work. Do you think

11:00.873 --> 11:07.721
planetary astronomy and planetary astronomers 
are considered respectable today by the other

11:00.873 --> 11:07.721
astronomers? I think very much so. I do not feel 
today that they draw any distinction as to the

11:09.163 --> 11:22.378
quality of a person because he works in the field of 
solar system research rather than in stellar or

11:09.163 --> 11:22.378
galactic research. I think that most modern 
astronomers probably feel that this study may not

11:23.485 --> 11:49.425
be quite as fundamental shall we say as studying 
the big bang or trying to solve some of the what they

11:23.485 --> 11:49.425
consider basic problems of the first few seconds 
of the universe or the missing mass or or the great

11:23.485 --> 11:49.425
attractor or the great celestial voids or what 
have you but i don't think they They probably look

11:50.165 --> 11:59.796
at it as sort of a different field, almost like 
biology and chemistry are a different field, not

11:50.165 --> 11:59.796
necessarily inferior, but just different and not 
as interesting to them. Again, back when you got

12:01.397 --> 12:12.269
started doing this, say around 1960, what was 
planetary astronomy like in the U.S.? It was

12:12.289 --> 12:13.931
almost non-existent. Really, G.P. Kuiper... was 
the only one who was doing modern physical

12:16.169 --> 12:25.540
observing of the planets at that particular time 
that I can think of off the top of my head. We had a

12:26.121 --> 12:32.128
very few people in celestial mechanics, about six 
of them, I think. We had Clements and Brower and

12:32.208 --> 12:45.805
Hergott and Herbig, not Herbig, Robbie,

12:32.208 --> 12:45.805
Herrick, the other one I was trying to think of. 
That was just about it. Brown of the lunar theory

12:50.434 --> 12:53.078
was dead by then. And in fact, there were so few 
people even who knew celestial mechanics that

12:54.420 --> 13:09.660
when the space program hit, the lab started 
shipping people en masse back to a special summer

12:54.420 --> 13:09.660
school that Dirk Brouwer held at Yale to teach 
people what celestial mechanics was all about.

13:09.700 --> 13:16.129
The subject wasn't even taught at Caltech, for 
example.

13:17.375 --> 13:25.977
Where do you think planetary astronomy would be 
now if it wasn't for the money NASA has spent in the

13:17.375 --> 13:25.977
last 30 years? Obviously it would be a very, very 
different field. I don't think If we didn't have

13:30.976 --> 13:37.625
the space program, I think there would still be a 
few isolated individuals who would study the

13:30.976 --> 13:37.625
planets from time to time. Any time you get new 
techniques, new instruments, new equipment,

13:37.685 --> 13:48.078
somebody's going to apply them to the obvious 
objects that are near at hand, like the planets.

13:48.499 --> 13:58.131
But I don't think it would have, well, much of our 
knowledge has clearly been found by the space

13:48.499 --> 13:58.131
probes, possibly

13:59.933 --> 14:04.219
I don't know, maybe a quarter as much of it has been 
found from the ground. And I don't think there

14:05.240 --> 14:10.288
would have been but a fraction of that if it hadn't 
been for NASA and the space program. I think the

14:10.508 --> 14:12.070
interest would not have been there. The people 
wouldn't have been attracted to the field. The

14:15.114 --> 14:21.724
telescopes wouldn't have been available for this 
less interesting work, less fundamental work, as

14:15.114 --> 14:21.724
it were. I think it's no question that NASA and the 
coming space program changed the whole field. Do

14:28.047 --> 14:31.076
you think that planetary astronomy is a part of 
astronomy? Yes, I do. I think that there are many

14:33.784 --> 14:37.635
people in the field whose background is more 
geology or meteorology than it is astronomy, but I

14:37.835 --> 14:56.780
think astronomers play a particular role, 
especially in the study of objects like comets and

14:37.835 --> 14:56.780
asteroids, the small bodies of the solar system, 
where they're still basically not looking at

14:37.835 --> 14:56.780
geological or meteorological processes. And 
similarly, with many of the satellites in the

14:57.601 --> 15:02.087
solar system, I think we all have something to 
contribute. And one of the interesting things

15:02.748 --> 15:10.682
about modern solar system astronomy is that it 
isn't just astronomy, but it's also geology and

15:02.748 --> 15:10.682
meteorology. And I think everybody works 
together very well. Back when this stuff started

15:15.129 --> 15:19.637
in the early 60s, You were in a special situation 
because JPL is actually a contractor to NASA

15:20.377 --> 15:28.206
through Caltech. And how was astronomy funded at 
JPL in those days? Did headquarters give a block

15:32.170 --> 15:38.998
grant to Caltech to be given to JPL to be used as JPL 
saw fit? Or did they say exactly what they wanted?

15:42.322 --> 15:45.085
This is in the early 60s when this stuff began. I 
was, of course, a very junior person at JPL in those

15:46.212 --> 15:50.418
days. I do not know for sure exactly how it was 
funded. I know that initially I simply got my money

15:54.264 --> 16:03.517
from my superiors, and if they thought what I 
wanted to do was right, then they found me the money

15:54.264 --> 16:03.517
to do it. So my guess is it was probably a block 
grant. I know that when I began building the Table

16:06.982 --> 16:15.274
Mountain Observatory and that I had a... brand, if 
you will, although it was not the result of a

16:15.642 --> 16:19.490
proposal. I simply sent a proposal to NASA, as it 
were. It wasn't reviewed as they are today, and

16:22.777 --> 16:31.255
they decided if what I proposed to do was 
reasonable, and they sent me the money to run the

16:31.538 --> 16:37.807
ground-based astronomy program at Table 
Mountain, for example, and to fund a number of

16:31.538 --> 16:37.807
people to work on it and work there. So in that 
sense, it was a block grant, not to JPL. It came in

16:43.234 --> 16:47.220
that case to me, and I was responsible for it. But 
earlier, it had come to my bosses, So I suppose you

16:51.367 --> 16:53.430
would call that a block grant. It certainly was not 
money to an individual to do a specific kind of

16:53.450 --> 16:57.857
work. And how's it done today? Today, of course, it 
is very much the individual who is funded. If the

17:03.487 --> 17:06.491
individual leaves, the money goes with him or her. 
And that money is on the basis of competitive

17:07.413 --> 17:13.082
proposals to do specific things. And it is... much 
today as if you were working in a university going

17:16.207 --> 17:21.473
to NASA or to the NSF for funds. It's a totally 
different approach to doing the research. It in

17:28.442 --> 17:33.308
some ways is not as pleasant of course. It was much 
easier when if you saw something new and exciting

17:33.588 --> 17:41.438
and interesting you could jump into it without 
having to worry about whether this was covered in

17:33.588 --> 17:41.438
your proposal and exactly what you would plan to 
do, but I suppose it also left possibilities for

17:41.705 --> 17:54.783
people to not do exactly what was right.

17:55.824 --> 18:03.354
As I recall, back in the early 60s, those of us that 
were observing kind of did what we could. There was

18:03.374 --> 18:05.417
so much to do. How is it done today? I mean, does the 
section chief or division chief say, we shall

18:07.554 --> 18:22.073
study Pluto this year, and everybody follows, or 
since now everybody has to get grants on their own,

18:07.554 --> 18:22.073
do they propose what they want to do? Individuals 
propose what they want to do today. I think any

18:25.108 --> 18:33.546
section manager in the science division at JPL who 
tried to tell an individual what he had to work on

18:25.108 --> 18:33.546
would sort of be laughed out of town. Unless, of 
course, he had money and the individual wanted the

18:33.607 --> 18:38.798
money, then that's something else again. But in 
general, left up to the individual today. This is

18:42.063 --> 18:45.449
true to a large extent. However, in times when 
billets become tight, then it may be that the lab or

18:45.489 --> 18:55.926
the division or the section may decide that, hey, 
we've got to cut back a little bit. And so they may

18:56.546 --> 19:05.661
look at those activities which seem less related 
to the flight programs of NASA and of the

18:56.546 --> 19:05.661
laboratory and decide that, let's not say decide, 
let's sort of suggest to the person that if he or she

19:06.232 --> 19:20.005
wants to continue in employment at the lab, it 
might be better to look for a new field that is more

19:06.232 --> 19:20.005
akin to the needs of the laboratory. However, that 
person, of course, if he or she has money, can take

19:20.846 --> 19:28.233
that money and go elsewhere and do it. JPL never did 
get a big telescope on Table Mountain. Not really,

19:33.113 --> 19:34.174
no. We tried, of course, and that's a big story in 
and of itself. However, in recent years, we did get

19:38.180 --> 19:55.022
from the Air Force the old 48-inch ALT-ALT-AS 
telescope that was at Cloudcroft, and this now has

19:38.180 --> 19:55.022
been erected on Table Mountain and, in fact, is 
going into regular scheduled observation in

19:38.180 --> 19:55.022
about two weeks. There is also a 40-inch reflector 
on Table Mountain that is owned by Pomona College

20:01.531 --> 20:07.738
And the time on that telescope is available, half 
of the time is available to people at JPL. What

20:08.559 --> 20:13.344
instrumentation, and also you have a 24-inch, is 
that still in operation? 24-inch is very much in

20:13.364 --> 20:15.987
operation. It's been the one instrument that has 
produced pretty good science throughout all of

20:16.027 --> 20:24.737
the years that Table Mountain has existed, which 
number roughly 30 now. uh well of course the 24 inch

20:25.443 --> 20:51.788
wasn't there initially it came in a few years later 
but let's say 25 years yeah it's uh it's has a large

20:25.443 --> 20:51.788
good a spectrograph on it which was heavily used at 
first has been more lightly used in recent years

20:25.443 --> 20:51.788
but i guess there are people planning to to bring it 
back into full use again there's been a great deal

20:25.443 --> 20:51.788
of photoelectric photometry and uh imaging with 
CCDs and prior to that Vidicon type detectors on

20:52.443 --> 20:58.732
the 24 inch. What kind of foci do the 40 inch and 48 
inch have that are available? I've never seen the

21:05.643 --> 21:07.005
40 inch. I have no idea what is available there. In 
the case of the 48 inch, again, I haven't been on the

21:09.669 --> 21:20.104
mountain now in more than 10 years. I have 
information here that I can give you that shows the

21:20.405 --> 21:31.922
exact instrumentation and foci and so on on the 
48-inch, but I shouldn't really say off the top of

21:20.405 --> 21:31.922
my head. We'll get to that later. You mentioned 
that JPL's attempt to get a decent-sized, a big

21:34.446 --> 21:43.499
telescope of a 100-inch class is a long story. 
Let's talk about some of that story. How did the

21:46.083 --> 21:48.066
idea start? Or was it obvious to everyone that you 
needed a dedicated planetary telescope? Well, I

21:53.104 --> 22:02.535
think with all of us here, it was obvious to us when 
we went out and tried to get time on existing large

21:53.104 --> 22:02.535
telescopes that that time simply was not 
available for planetary work. All of the

22:03.897 --> 22:05.639
telescopes were very busy. And even in those days, 
there were more astronomers wanting time than

22:05.859 --> 22:10.344
there was time available. And when good young 
people could not get time at the major

22:17.054 --> 22:22.504
instruments, it was pretty obvious that we needed 
a major instrument of our own. And I couldn't say

22:23.545 --> 22:28.394
that any one person was responsible for that idea. 
It was a very obvious one. If you can't get the time

22:29.997 --> 22:35.687
you need, you better build your own. And that, in 
fact, was what was suggested by people like Ira

22:35.767 --> 22:41.998
Bowen, who was then the director at Mount Wilson. 
And he, in fact, helped a great deal in pushing NASA

22:42.923 --> 22:51.813
into the idea that they needed to build their own 
telescope for planetary astronomy. He certainly

22:52.434 --> 23:01.064
agreed that there was still a great deal of good, 
solid astrophysical work on the planet that could

22:52.434 --> 23:01.064
be done with modern equipment. He was, I think, a 
very honest, straightforward, actually rather

23:02.506 --> 23:10.635
far-thinking individual who recognized the fact 
that there was a great deal left to be done from the

23:11.138 --> 23:15.484
ground. And he gave a lot of good advice to NASA, 
suggesting that they should go ahead and build

23:15.524 --> 23:25.199
their own telescope.

23:25.980 --> 23:29.545
I got Homer Newell to sign two things. And one was 
for a telescope at McDonald Observatory at the

23:29.565 --> 23:33.691
University of Texas. And one was for what I thought 
was going to be a telescope on Table Mountain.

23:40.450 --> 23:43.074
Whatever happened about that time I left 
headquarters? Caltech, unfortunately, is what

23:43.094 --> 23:45.397
happened. The feeling was that since we were young 
and not well known, and there were a lot of famous

23:47.681 --> 23:59.138
astronomers at Caltech, that this ought to be some 
kind of a joint effort between Caltech and JPL.

23:59.158 --> 24:09.293
Unfortunately, what JPL wanted was a good 
telescope in a good site that could get to work in a

23:59.158 --> 24:09.293
hurry, doing... astronomical research. What 
Caltech wanted was a really new, modern,

24:11.684 --> 24:23.542
earth-shaking telescope in the world's very best 
possible site. And their idea was to perhaps do a

24:24.703 --> 24:30.492
five-year seeing survey, and some work was 
actually done on that. Telescopes were mounted at

24:30.572 --> 24:34.538
White Mountain, for example, for a time, and We got 
information from Berkeley, who had also mounted a

24:34.788 --> 24:39.474
seeing study up there. But they really began 
looking for the world's greatest site for a

24:40.736 --> 24:49.347
planetary telescope, thinking that seeing was 
all important in planetary detail work. And they

24:50.448 --> 24:53.372
had a very long range plan. I think that what it 
finally came down to was that their idea of what

24:54.934 --> 25:02.584
needed to be done and ours were so different, and I 
think both Well, NASA also wanted to get on the air,

25:03.307 --> 25:06.653
so to speak. So we could never reach an agreement 
with Caltech that we both felt comfortable with

25:07.474 --> 25:19.615
and finally wound up, as I understood it, with the 
money going to Hawaii, which of course was a very

25:07.474 --> 25:19.615
superior site, as it turned out. Right, but which 
had no astronomers whatsoever except a few solar

25:19.635 --> 25:23.402
types. That's right. Then there was another 
project that I guess finally became the infrared

25:26.527 --> 25:33.276
telescope facility in Lunakea, the light bucket. 
Do you remember the light? JPL was going to build a

25:34.177 --> 25:35.740
light bucket. How did that get started? Was Frank 
Gray involved in that or something like that? I

25:40.146 --> 25:42.529
never knew the details on that one, Ron. I wish I 
had. Frank Gray was the assistant section manager

25:44.852 --> 25:52.062
in those days, and he could very well have been 
heavily involved in it. But by that time, I was not

25:52.447 --> 25:57.673
heavily involved any longer in the field. I had 
pushed hard to build a... I had even the blueprints

26:00.317 --> 26:07.085
in my office for the 84-inch Kitt Peak, which we 
were proposing to duplicate to save time. Again,

26:07.145 --> 26:15.315
here was an existing working telescope, and we had 
a complete set of blueprints for it, and it would

26:07.145 --> 26:15.315
have been easy and cheap to simply duplicate 
everything at Table Mountain. When that money

26:15.920 --> 26:22.467
didn't come, we had preliminary designs for a 
48-inch, preliminary designs for a 60-inch.

26:25.330 --> 26:26.311
We got none of those. And when it became obvious the 
telescope was going elsewhere, in fact, I got

26:27.453 --> 26:40.287
heavily involved in other areas, in particular in 
work on comets and advanced comet missions. And

26:40.427 --> 26:45.252
part of the problem was that I didn't have my Ph.D., 
And at that time, I had a division manager who

26:45.620 --> 26:51.931
didn't go by what you did, but by what your 
credentials were. Who was? Robert Magreblian.

26:56.959 --> 27:07.837
And he moved me out of the slot as head of the 
astronomy group and put me in charge of a group

26:56.959 --> 27:07.837
which was doing models of the planets for the 
projects. And I did that and various advanced

27:08.759 --> 27:11.323
studies. And then from there, I started studying 
comet missions, got extremely interested in

27:11.843 --> 27:30.966
comets, and began my own research program in 
cometary astrophysics, and started going to

27:11.843 --> 27:30.966
other observatories and working with other 
people, and sort of divorced myself from the

27:11.843 --> 27:30.966
astronomy program at JPL. I tried to do some work at 
Table Mountain, but it was so ill-funded by the

27:32.077 --> 27:42.972
mid-'70s that we didn't have the manpower to even 
keep the auxiliary instrumentation running

27:32.077 --> 27:42.972
properly. And so from the mid-'70s on, I worked on 
advanced studies at JPL of comet missions and then

27:43.052 --> 27:56.871
did my own research at other places like Mauna Kea 
and later at Lick Observatory. That brings up an

27:57.792 --> 27:59.574
interesting question. Through the 20s and 30s and 
40s, when solar system studies in general have a

28:01.844 --> 28:07.374
bad odor about them. It was always legitimate to 
study comets. Why? Well, comets, I guess, didn't

28:13.605 --> 28:23.042
have any thoughts on anybody's part about life and 
the solar system and a little green man. comets

28:23.680 --> 28:27.745
were simply a phenomenon that had fascinated 
mankind throughout history. They were an

28:27.805 --> 28:34.314
interesting astrophysical problem, both as to 
their origin and to the way they work. What in the

28:35.095 --> 28:36.016
heck are they? What are they made of? And why do they 
behave the way they do? And their problems were

28:38.860 --> 28:45.789
sufficiently enigmatic that they had always 
fascinated even the classical stellar

28:38.860 --> 28:45.789
astronomer. And indeed, they remained a subject 
that was always considered quite a legitimate one

28:45.889 --> 28:52.337
for study. And it's sort of ironic that the very 
objects which did remain of interest to the

28:52.553 --> 29:07.812
classic stellar and galactic astronomer are the 
single object to which NASA has never mounted a

28:52.553 --> 29:07.812
mission.

29:08.838 --> 29:14.206
What do you think killed planetary astronomy in 
the early part of this century, effectively

29:08.838 --> 29:14.206
killed it? I know some was being done, but if you 
look at the journals in 1900 and then you look at

29:14.226 --> 29:23.398
1930, wow, is there a difference. What's the 
reason, or reasons? Well, I think there are, to my

29:25.782 --> 29:30.989
way of thinking, off the top of my head, a couple of 
things can be said about it. For one thing, large

29:31.029 --> 29:35.976
telescopes became available which gathered a 
great deal of light and allowed people to do

29:36.479 --> 29:49.714
high-resolution spectroscopy, to go deep into 
the universe studying the extragalactic

29:36.479 --> 29:49.714
nebulae, the galaxies, the expansion of the 
universe. These problems were totally

29:50.054 --> 29:52.117
fascinating. But if you wanted to study the 
planets with a large telescope, obviously you

29:53.078 --> 30:04.090
didn't get any better resolution with the large 
telescopes than you did with much smaller ones

29:53.078 --> 30:04.090
simply because you were atmospheric seeing 
limited. People in those days didn't know how much

30:04.762 --> 30:26.389
of that seeing was created locally by 
uncontrolled thermal problems, but in any case, a

30:04.762 --> 30:26.389
big telescope wasn't that much better than a 
little one for studying the kind of planetary work

30:04.762 --> 30:26.389
that people had traditionally done, which is to 
say planetary detail, the kind of thing that

30:04.762 --> 30:26.389
Percival Lowell had done. So they sort of went off 
and developed new instrumentation and went off

30:26.429 --> 30:33.317
into the universe. There were always a few people 
who remained in the field, including some with the

30:33.550 --> 30:41.459
biggest telescope in the world, 100 inch at that 
time. But I think it was the fascination with the

30:41.479 --> 30:59.018
deep space problems and the fact that the big 
telescopes couldn't do that much more than the

30:41.479 --> 30:59.018
little ones could in those times on the planets 
that allowed the planetary field to simply die. Do

31:00.010 --> 31:08.143
you think NSA headquarters tries to micromanage 
scientific projects too much? Well, not in the

31:08.163 --> 31:14.394
individual research particularly. I mean, they 
manage it in the sense that they decide how much

31:14.514 --> 31:26.153
money is available for stellar astronomy versus 
planetary astronomy versus Earth. And really, if

31:26.555 --> 31:40.592
you look at it, the only reason they support this 
research at all is because of the very

31:26.555 --> 31:40.592
complementary way that it blends in with their 
spaceflight missions. But their real interest is

31:40.612 --> 31:49.542
in the missions, and they're simply supporting 
them with this ground-based research. I think

31:49.775 --> 31:53.180
they don't try to tell an individual what he has to 
do. On the other hand, the amount of money that's

31:53.240 --> 32:05.620
available in a given field is certainly a function 
of their interest in it and, well, the universe we

31:53.240 --> 32:05.620
live in, why the guy who has the bucks calls the 
shots. Do you think over the years the people at

32:06.962 --> 32:13.993
headquarters really knew what was going on in 
planetary astronomy or were they playing

32:06.962 --> 32:13.993
catch-up? Well, let's face it, most of them were 
not planetary astronomers themselves. There

32:19.130 --> 32:23.955
have been obvious exceptions to that, yourself 
among them.

32:26.337 --> 32:35.666
But no person sitting in Washington can really 
retain a feel for the work in the field. It's

32:36.907 --> 32:43.153
virtually impossible, to my way of thinking, for a 
person with a job in Washington retain a research

32:43.522 --> 32:47.007
program of his own or her own.

32:50.031 --> 32:52.034
The exceptions are very forced. I think if the 
people running the programs at headquarters were

32:52.054 --> 33:04.652
handled perhaps the way section managers are in 
the science sections at JPL, that is on an

32:52.054 --> 33:04.652
alternating, rotating two-year basis, where 
they remained scientists a good part of the time,

33:05.088 --> 33:16.474
but then filled in and devoted a couple of years to 
seeing after NASA's interest, maybe that would be

33:05.088 --> 33:16.474
a solution. But it has been my experience that 
generally when people go to Washington, The very,

33:23.498 --> 33:44.713
very fine people that often go there simply after a 
time become so involved in their own worries about

33:23.498 --> 33:44.713
their programs that they lose any feel for or sight 
of the real research and the real interests of the

33:23.498 --> 33:44.713
people in the field actually doing the work.

33:46.035 --> 33:50.282
What do you think the public thinks of planetary 
astronomy and astronomy in general? I think

33:50.920 --> 33:54.605
they're fascinated by it, probably for a lot of 
wrong reasons. I'm sure that when they think of the

33:54.765 --> 34:12.851
solar system, they're thinking, again, even in 
the classic Lowellian sense of little green men,

33:54.765 --> 34:12.851
and there's certainly a lot of fanatics out there 
in the UFO field and what have you that have a lot of

33:54.765 --> 34:12.851
interest in this sort of thing, but it's all 
misplaced. On the other hand, I think the young

34:13.672 --> 34:17.417
people find... real modern astronomy 
fascinating. Obviously, again, they're

34:21.872 --> 34:35.447
somewhat steered in that direction by the Star 
Wars and Star Trek kind of phenomenon, but I think

34:21.872 --> 34:35.447
it gives them a healthy interest in science, and I 
think they're genuinely interested. I'm not sure

34:36.548 --> 34:39.651
that it's always brought to them in the proper way. 
I'm sure that many adults don't understand it at

34:44.245 --> 34:53.987
all, and perhaps poo-poo it, but I think the 
younger generation has a genuine interest in

34:44.245 --> 34:53.987
astronomy, both solar system and deep space 
astronomy. Do you think planetary astronomers

34:55.210 --> 35:03.047
have done as good a job as they could of putting your 
case across to the public and to Congress?

35:03.567 --> 35:04.488
Probably not. Let's face it, scientists in 
general are not necessarily salespeople. There

35:09.335 --> 35:15.583
have been a few obviously very good salespeople 
for planetary astronomy, like Carl Sagan. And

35:16.624 --> 35:25.997
Carl, I think, usually has done a good job of 
selling it, although there Maybe some things that

35:27.023 --> 35:43.379
he's done that weren't in our best interest, but I 
think he's a straightforward and honest and

35:27.023 --> 35:43.379
well-meaning guy who's done an awful lot to help 
sell the space program to Congress and to the

35:27.023 --> 35:43.379
world. I think we could use a few more, a little 
different maybe, but a few more similar people.

35:50.406 --> 35:56.912
But I'm sure that the likes of you and I have not 
perhaps done our part and perhaps are not capable

35:57.668 --> 36:03.415
of doing the sales job that needs to be done. Thirty 
years ago, there was just an American

36:06.058 --> 36:08.922
Astronomical Society. Now there's a lot of 
sub-societies, particularly there's the

36:08.982 --> 36:16.331
Division for Planetary Astronomy, which even has 
its own official journal, Icarus. What are these

36:17.773 --> 36:19.575
developments? Do you think on the whole that 
they've been good, bad, or just inevitable? I

36:25.006 --> 36:34.980
think they've been good in the sense that it would 
have been very difficult for planetary astronomy

36:25.006 --> 36:34.980
to grow if it had remained totally under the thumb 
of the parent society. By having its own

36:35.440 --> 36:46.375
organization and its own journal and its own 
prizes, why, it could develop as an entity and a

36:35.440 --> 36:46.375
very strong one in its own right. And I think it 
would have been almost impossible for this to

36:47.236 --> 36:53.545
happen under the thumb of the parent society. 
These days do you think that real quote-unquote

36:54.166 --> 37:00.852
astronomers and planetary astronomers talk to 
each other very much? I think they do, maybe not as

37:02.553 --> 37:21.521
much as they should, but there is a very definite 
attempt to occasionally hold meetings of the

37:02.553 --> 37:21.521
parent society and the divisions jointly, and to 
have prize winners and so on from the divisions

37:02.553 --> 37:21.521
deliver prize lectures at the parent society. I 
think there's much more appreciation for each

37:23.303 --> 37:30.754
other today, certainly, than there was 30 years 
ago.

37:31.308 --> 37:43.420
The feelings are improving, which isn't to say 
that the stellar and galactic astronomers still

37:31.308 --> 37:43.420
don't feel that their field is the real astronomy 
and more important than solar system work. And

37:44.141 --> 37:53.910
probably a lot of them tend to lump solar system 
astronomers into the class along with geologists

37:44.141 --> 37:53.910
and meteorologists as opposed to being real 
astronomers. But I think they respect one another

37:55.352 --> 38:00.977
and are interested in each other's work to an 
extent. Okay, for 35 years now, we've been going to

38:02.577 --> 38:08.905
planets and observing them from the ground and 
spacecraft and directly. Not a trace of, not a

38:10.507 --> 38:18.497
trace of more fossil of any life anywhere in the 
solar system except Earth. In particular, no

38:19.478 --> 38:24.364
trace of life so far on Mars. Do you think that's had 
a big effect on the public and on funding? Big

38:29.730 --> 38:31.032
negative effect or not? Oh, boy, that's hard to 
say. I think that astronomers never really

38:35.990 --> 38:44.100
expected to find any significant form of life 
anywhere in our solar system. I think many,

38:44.120 --> 38:50.909
perhaps most of them, feel that there may be some 
form of life elsewhere in the galaxy and certainly

38:44.120 --> 38:50.909
in the universe. It's an awfully big universe for 
this to only have happened once. And whether you

38:55.334 --> 39:01.322
think about this from a purely scientific point of 
view or even from a religious point of view... Why

39:01.724 --> 39:06.749
should God create such an enormous universe and 
only inhabit one teeny tiny mote of it?

39:09.693 --> 39:16.059
And if you look at it from a purely biological 
evolutionary point of view, if it happened here,

39:09.693 --> 39:16.059
why can't it have happened somewhere else? So I 
think most scientists probably feel somewhere in

39:16.140 --> 39:22.566
the universe there's life, other than here and 
here on Earth. But none of us really expected to

39:23.107 --> 39:25.590
find it in the solar system. The public in general 
probably did. And some of them may be disappointed

39:30.226 --> 39:32.529
by it. And I think that some of them are put off now, 
perhaps, by people trying to oversell programs on

39:32.589 --> 39:49.753
the basis of

39:32.589 --> 39:49.753
looking for life, even though it is still a 
legitimate thing to do to see if there's any

39:32.589 --> 39:49.753
evidence, let's say, on Mars of... or of any form of 
life ever having existed. This is a legitimate

39:55.160 --> 40:01.748
scientific study like any other, but it's not the 
kind of thing that's going to enchant the general

39:55.160 --> 40:01.748
public. They want to see some walking and talking, 
or at least growling. A lot of people lately have

40:08.617 --> 40:20.112
been getting a lot of publicity and some money for 
studying things like the possibility of planets

40:08.617 --> 40:20.112
around other stars. Killer asteroids, ozone 
hole, ozone layer hole, and the search for

40:20.699 --> 40:28.186
extraterrestrial intelligence. Do you think 
those people are overdoing it a bit or not? I think

40:33.001 --> 40:35.285
they're all legitimate fields of study. I think 
that as virtually every program, they are

40:35.505 --> 40:45.101
oversold in the sense that they are giving love and 
motherhood statements, which are their ultimate

40:35.505 --> 40:45.101
goal. The implication is that these programs are 
going to be solved with a few bucks in a short period

40:45.301 --> 40:55.598
of time when, in fact, they may not really say that, 
but the implication is there. Whereas, in fact,

40:55.678 --> 40:59.464
most of these are very long-range programs. and 
are going to have to be followed for many decades to

40:59.984 --> 41:04.971
have any real hope of success. So I think there is a 
big tendency on everyone's part to try to

41:05.391 --> 41:16.325
oversell, because with the shortage of funds, 
everybody feels they've got almost half to

41:05.391 --> 41:16.325
oversell in order to get funded. And that's 
unfortunate. I mean, every one of those programs

41:19.289 --> 41:25.317
is a legitimate program, and it's a legitimate 
scientific study. But I think they probably are

41:26.073 --> 41:33.306
oversold in that people tend to think that they're 
going to get results cheaper and sooner than they

41:26.073 --> 41:33.306
really are.

41:36.351 --> 41:40.599
What's, in your opinion, what's the state of 
planetary astronomy today in this country? Plus,

41:41.580 --> 41:42.622
minus, zero? Well, I'm not sure what you mean by 
state. Expanding, idling, sinking. it's sinking

41:50.440 --> 42:19.418
i think i don't think there's any question of that 
the funding for planetary astronomy has not

41:50.440 --> 42:19.418
increased for a decade and there's been no real 
allowance made for inflation i think there's

41:50.440 --> 42:19.418
enormous pressure from the fact that any 
university professor is judged in part by the

41:50.440 --> 42:19.418
number of graduates that he has and the number of 
phds that he produces and you've got to figure if

41:50.440 --> 42:19.418
every individual planetary astronomer out there 
in a university produces even five or six

42:19.718 --> 42:43.906
students, and most of them, it's probably more 
like 10 PhDs in the field during their working

42:19.718 --> 42:43.906
lifetime, you can see how rapidly the number of 
people in the field is going to grow, and each of

42:19.718 --> 42:43.906
them in turn then is going to have the same problem 
of getting funding and have their own students.

42:44.867 --> 42:46.789
And so you tend to get an exponential growth. And 
clearly no field can sustain an exponential

42:47.157 --> 42:51.622
growth for a long period of time. Planetary 
astronomy has done it, did it for a couple of

42:51.722 --> 42:56.488
decades. And clearly that has to stop. So there's 
tremendous pressure just from there being too

43:00.253 --> 43:05.579
many people today for the funds that are 
available. And you might argue that that's good

43:06.200 --> 43:12.507
for the field in that you can claim that the very 
best will rise to the top and be funded. But I think

43:13.145 --> 43:20.754
it's not doing any young person a favor to take them 
into planetary astronomy today. At least you have

43:20.874 --> 43:33.189
to be honest and explain the facts of life to them 
that they're going to have to be awfully good and

43:20.874 --> 43:33.189
work awfully hard if they're to have any real hope 
of succeeding in the field. Over the years, what's

43:33.389 --> 43:37.714
JPL's attitude been? Looking at it from the 
bottom, looking up, what do you think the

43:37.734 --> 43:41.599
people... Well, what's the impression you got of 
what's JPL's quote-unquote attitude towards

43:41.900 --> 43:49.231
planetary astronomy? Necessary evil, an 
ornament, or what? I think the attitude at the lab

43:54.098 --> 43:58.424
has always been fairly good. I think they found 
astronomers to be useful, well, all planetary

43:59.265 --> 44:07.317
scientists, not just astronomers, but all of the 
people in the field to be useful. a useful adjunct

44:08.073 --> 44:14.120
in that they were around to help when questions 
came up on the flight projects. And I think the

44:14.661 --> 44:22.491
feeling has been that the science produced here 
has been of sufficient quality for JPL to be quite

44:14.661 --> 44:22.491
proud of it. And I think the attitude of senior 
management at the lab towards science has always

44:24.393 --> 44:29.379
been good. It's never been, of course, their 
fundamental goal. Their fundamental goal has

44:31.842 --> 44:36.848
always been and remains to sell new projects. So 
while I think the scientists are respected and

44:40.539 --> 44:57.280
have a place, everybody feels they have a place 
here, that place is not going to be allowed to

44:40.539 --> 44:57.280
interfere in any way with the lab's chief goals, 
which are to fly missions. Do you think there's

44:57.300 --> 45:06.632
enough support for ground-based work as opposed 
to the money spent on probes by NASA?

45:09.532 --> 45:33.218
I have to say no, in a way, in the sense that if you 
actually look at the dollars spent on probes

45:09.532 --> 45:33.218
through the last couple of decades and the dollars 
spent supporting ground-based work, the amount

45:09.532 --> 45:33.218
of knowledge that we've gained from the 
ground-based work is far larger proportionally

45:09.532 --> 45:33.218
than the money spent on it. And as long as that 
continues to happen, then one has to argue that

45:37.882 --> 45:41.829
perhaps there should be more funding for the 
ground-based work. You're getting more bang for

45:42.289 --> 45:45.314
buck out of the ground-based stuff. Now clearly 
there are many things that you cannot do from the

45:45.334 --> 45:48.800
ground. You could never have done without the 
probes. And so I'm not arguing to dismantle one in

45:52.546 --> 45:56.433
favor of the other. I'm simply saying that I think 
perhaps their balance has always been a little bit

45:56.513 --> 46:01.842
off. They get a lot of good data. And then they have a 
brief research and analysis program on that data.

46:08.933 --> 46:17.206
And before the treasure trove that they've gained 
with a probe is really worked out, the research

46:08.933 --> 46:17.206
program is cut off, and they go on to something 
else. And I think that's short-sighted. And I

46:20.591 --> 46:31.568
think, similarly, the actual support of 
ground-based observations has been a little

46:20.591 --> 46:31.568
lacking in, well, I think the balance is a little 
off. Let me put it that way.
