00:02.107 --> 00:07.374
Senator Hatfield, do you give your permission to 
allow this to be used as quotable material for a

00:02.107 --> 00:07.374
research paper? I, Mark Hatfield, do. Thank you 
very much. As you know, this interview will focus

00:12.501 --> 00:22.855
on the Vietnam War and particularly your role in 
the Vietnam War protest movement. And

00:23.857 --> 00:27.642
specifically,

00:28.381 --> 00:37.452
What instances caused you, as early as the 1965 
Governor's Convention, to come out publicly and

00:28.381 --> 00:37.452
state your opposition to the war?

00:41.097 --> 00:47.645
Well, I had expressed my reservations in 
opposition to the war to a goodly number of people

00:41.097 --> 00:47.645
privately. And in 1965, And I'd made a few speeches 
around the state, the question-answer period, or

00:51.652 --> 01:13.400
I would make some comment about my disbelief that 
we had a national interest, a national interest

00:51.652 --> 01:13.400
that justified getting involved in war in 
Southeast Asia. I had seen it purely as a failure of

01:16.424 --> 01:29.845
the French to reestablish its colonial domain and 
that we were in effect picking up the marbles where

01:16.424 --> 01:29.845
the French failed and were finally driven out 
following the battle of Dien Bien Phu. So I had a

01:29.865 --> 01:38.338
background there of having been in Vietnam while 
we were allies with Ho Chi Minh against the

01:29.865 --> 01:38.338
Japanese in World War II. But the governor's 
conference that was held that year in Minneapolis

01:45.365 --> 01:59.034
A number of the Johnson supporters, President 
Lyndon Johnson supporters, Democrats, were very

01:45.365 --> 01:59.034
anxious to use the governor's conference to 
affirm the president's war policy. He had gone

01:59.054 --> 02:03.002
before the FLCIO and gotten a resolution. passed 
affirming his war policy. He had obtained some

02:06.803 --> 02:11.992
similar business group resolutions. He was 
looking, reaching out to get as many various

02:12.112 --> 02:23.691
groups as he could to go on record passing a formal 
resolution to support the war policy. He liked to

02:25.240 --> 02:39.075
wave those in his public speeches to indicate that 
he had the support of Americans and that radicals,

02:25.240 --> 02:39.075
the anti-war protesters, were but a very small, 
vocal, radical minority. So when the governors

02:40.136 --> 02:53.110
met in their annual conference in Minneapolis, a 
group of his supporters offered a resolution to

02:40.136 --> 02:53.110
endorse President Johnson's war policy. It was 
not debated at any length. They tried to ram it

02:55.480 --> 02:59.806
through. I attempted to ask some questions about 
the scope and why we were doing this, but it

03:01.128 --> 03:11.243
nevertheless was ramrodded through. And at the 
time the vote was taken, it was a voice vote. And I

03:19.294 --> 03:24.762
made my voice heard. by voting no. As I recall, they 
didn't even ask for the no's. It was just sort of all

03:32.486 --> 03:46.261
those in favor say aye, and I remember that I had to 
make my voice loud in order to register my no vote.

03:46.281 --> 03:52.588
Well, the meeting adjourned immediately, and we 
went out into the lobby and

03:55.454 --> 04:05.644
The press was asking for my explanation of my vote 
when Governor George Romney of Michigan came up

03:55.454 --> 04:05.644
and said, well, I voted no, too. And so I remember 
Governor Conley coming by, who was then governor

04:07.766 --> 04:24.263
of Texas, and interrupted my press conference by 
shaking his finger in my face and saying, you have

04:07.766 --> 04:24.263
done a disservice to your country. And it was 
obviously not a popular vote, although I did have

04:26.082 --> 04:36.178
some colleagues who said, well, I wish we didn't 
have that vote.

04:39.403 --> 04:41.667
I respect your negative vote. If I did that, my 
constituents would eat me alive. And so that was

04:46.375 --> 04:49.380
how I got into it. Then, of course, it made a news 
item. Well, President Johnson then sent Air Force

04:54.820 --> 05:03.611
his Air Force plane up to Minneapolis to bring us 
all down to Washington so that we could be briefed.

05:03.631 --> 05:16.227
And as he had us briefed in the White House, George 
Romney got up and said, well, Mr. President, your

05:03.631 --> 05:16.227
briefing has convinced me that you're right. And 
so he said, I now support your policy. I didn't say

05:20.639 --> 05:22.221
anything at the time. And as a meeting then sort of 
adjourned, President Johnson came over to me and

05:22.762 --> 05:29.670
asked me how I felt now. And I said, well, I still 
oppose the war. I had not changed my mind. I heard

05:34.676 --> 05:44.789
nothing that I had not read or heard about before as 
justification for the war, and I still disagree.

05:44.809 --> 05:48.874
And at that time, he expressed some surprise when I 
When he next asked me if I will, do you want to go out

05:49.715 --> 05:54.240
and see the press then? And I said, no, I have no 
desire to see the press. I registered my vote down

05:56.723 --> 06:01.008
at the governor's conference. And I have no desire 
to see the press. I'd like to avoid the press. And he

06:05.493 --> 06:10.278
looked at me and he said, well, you really believe 
it then, don't you? And I said, of course I do. Very

06:11.920 --> 06:13.782
strong convictions on this. So he had one of his 
staff people let me out the side door and I escaped

06:14.470 --> 06:20.360
the press. That was sort of the events as I recall 
them at this time. Okay, I guess that actually

06:26.690 --> 06:29.234
brings up two questions. One, I read in your book 
that You felt that Lyndon Johnson was able to make

06:32.560 --> 06:51.681
the war, minimalize the war protest by making it 
look like the administration versus the hippies

06:32.560 --> 06:51.681
and sort of left out all the dissent that was being 
felt in the country in the middle class and as well

06:32.560 --> 06:51.681
as the Senators. How was he able to do that? Well, 
you have to remember the President of the United

06:55.185 --> 07:00.070
States has tremendous ability to manipulate news 
in which he has been the chief architect. After

07:05.873 --> 07:13.105
all, he can call up a news person or he could call a 
news conference and the whole nation listens to

07:05.873 --> 07:13.105
what the president says. A governor of a western 
state does not command that kind of news coverage

07:19.405 --> 07:28.459
and therefore he has the ability to override and 
more or less mold the news as he wants. As they say,

07:28.479 --> 07:30.322
put a spin on the news. You have over 500 members of 
the Congress and here again, 500 members or even

07:31.704 --> 07:40.958
two or three that were dissenters at that time, 
only two in the Senate. They don't command that

07:42.085 --> 07:47.112
kind of news attention. So the president really 
has a tremendous advantage. He's one person

07:50.176 --> 07:53.060
speaking for one branch of government. And 
obviously, as contrasted to over 500 members

07:55.483 --> 08:06.017
speaking for the legislative branch of 
government, he has an advantage. And he wanted to

08:06.757 --> 08:23.803
portray the war protesters in a stereotype with 
the Jane Fondas and the hippies, the radicals who

08:06.757 --> 08:23.803
were burning down the ROTC buildings on 
university campuses. those who were setting

08:24.155 --> 08:27.919
firebombs in the streets. You know, there's 
nothing that set our effort back more than the

08:29.421 --> 08:42.576
radicals who the hypocrisy of using violence to 
protest violence came through to the American

08:29.421 --> 08:42.576
people very clearly. American people don't have 
much time for those who are talking about war and

08:48.050 --> 09:00.388
their attitude toward war and then using in effect 
violence to express themselves to exercise their

08:48.050 --> 09:00.388
freedom of speech they weren't helping the cause i 
can assure you And as a consequence, he exploited

09:00.571 --> 09:02.674
that. Johnson had, you know, the cameras and the 
news media loved the action of something that was

09:03.354 --> 09:19.074
exploding in the streets or something that was 
burning a building down, burning the flag and all

09:03.354 --> 09:19.074
of those things that the extremists were doing. It 
was played on the tube every night, or at least very

09:20.535 --> 09:25.341
frequently. And then you had the... American 
soldiers fighting, you know, and dying for, under

09:28.904 --> 09:37.014
their government command, government policy. 
And the contrast was very, very great. And I can

09:41.639 --> 09:58.540
assure you, as one of those protesters within the 
establishment, within the government as I was, it

09:41.639 --> 09:58.540
made our task very, very difficult to separate 
ourselves and to have a responsible protest, a

09:41.639 --> 09:58.540
legitimate protest, as against the kind of 
radical extremists that were out there on the

09:59.414 --> 10:06.110
streets.

10:07.252 --> 10:16.073
Were there any groups, protest groups, actually, 
such as Students for a Democratic Society or Women

10:07.252 --> 10:16.073
for Peace, that you attempted in any way to 
correspond with and to work towards a positive

10:16.762 --> 10:28.637
goal, or did you try to remove yourselves 
completely from those kind of organizations?

10:28.657 --> 10:36.406
Well, initially, when I was governor, it was 
difficult to maintain national contact. I had a

10:36.506 --> 10:37.507
lot of mail. I had telephone calls, and I had organ 
groups that were protesters with whom I met very

10:38.829 --> 10:46.178
regularly. trying to work out some kind of a 
rallying point of responsible protest. It was not

10:53.514 --> 11:06.588
until I got to the Senate, which was in 1966 
election, that I found that there were a number of

10:53.514 --> 11:06.588
senators by now in 1967. It would have been by 
January. I was elected in 66 and sworn in in

11:08.150 --> 11:11.794
January. I found that it had expanded beyond just 
Wayne Morse and Dr. Greening of Alaska, who had

11:12.972 --> 11:23.672
cast the only two votes against the Gulf of Tonkin 
resolution. By this time, Senator Fulbright of

11:24.353 --> 11:36.516
Arkansas, who was the chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, was expressing his

11:24.353 --> 11:36.516
dissent, and a few other senators. But the 
difficulty was what in the world did you rally?

11:41.886 --> 11:53.738
What was the focus of dissent other than just 
speech-making or this violence and such out on the

11:41.886 --> 11:53.738
countryside? So Senator McGovern and I decided 
that what we ought to do would be to offer a

11:53.758 --> 12:06.030
resolution to cut off the funds prospectively. So 
we weren't going to cut off the equipment flowing

12:06.382 --> 12:15.515
to our soldiers out there on the battlefront, deny 
them the opportunity to defend themselves. But we

12:16.056 --> 12:24.467
were making a prospecting that we would, this 
resolution called for the cutoff of any funds to

12:16.056 --> 12:24.467
conduct war as of a certain prospective date. And 
this became then the battle cry, the so-called

12:26.130 --> 12:33.520
Hatfield-McGovern Amendment. We had a 
professional come down from New York. I wish I

12:41.223 --> 12:42.445
could remember his name. It's probably in the 
book. And we took some television time

12:44.608 --> 12:52.961
underwritten by some of the businessmen who were 
against the war. And on that television, Frank

12:54.083 --> 13:03.237
Church, a Democrat from Idaho, and Harold Hughes, 
Democrat from Iowa, George McGovern, Charlie

13:04.280 --> 13:10.931
Goodell, Republican from New York State, and 
myself, as I recall. Was there one more? No, I think

13:14.076 --> 13:15.198
that was it. We went on a television prime time and 
appealed to the American public to support our

13:16.340 --> 13:27.098
resolution and to send us contributions. in order 
to advertise and to communicate and disperse this

13:27.837 --> 13:36.553
resolution and create it as a rallying point. The 
Methodist Center up on the hill became the place

13:36.573 --> 13:45.429
that these letters came in, and they came in by the 
thousands. We were overwhelmed. We could never

13:46.772 --> 13:50.318
believe that the dollar bill, $5, the $20, that 
people all over this country sent to be helpful in

13:50.922 --> 13:57.269
our effort. Now, that became the first rallying 
point of an action that we took from within the

13:57.289 --> 14:03.957
institution. We only had seven co-sponsors, as I 
recall, a handful. And we reintroduced it, and

14:09.284 --> 14:13.909
that became then the focus of protest and it got up 
to 48 votes out of 100 senators and Mr. Nixon by this

14:14.075 --> 14:30.544
time had been elected and began to read the signals 
and that's when he began his plans for withdrawal.

14:33.850 --> 14:35.593
Speaking of Nixon, what Actually, the McGovern 
race is more what I'm interested in. If there was so

14:41.253 --> 14:55.449
much anti-war feeling by the time the 72 election 
rolled around, why was McGovern able to only pull

14:41.253 --> 14:55.449
the very limited number of votes that he did in that 
election? Did you see any particular reason?

15:02.316 --> 15:03.518
Pardon? Any particular reason for that? There 
were a number of reasons. First of all, by 72, there

15:10.223 --> 15:24.496
were fairly clear signals the administration was 
moving to find an exit from the war. In 68, Mr. Nixon

15:26.538 --> 15:30.041
had a secret plan. He said he wasn't going to talk 
about the war the rest of the time of the election

15:30.101 --> 15:36.647
campaign in 68. And that was against Mr. Humphrey, 
who was, of course, Mr. Johnson's vice president

15:37.673 --> 15:48.342
and was one of the architects of the whole war 
policy. By 72, the

15:48.442 --> 15:57.850
whole effort in the Congress had focused more 
clearly. And I think there were a lot of peripheral

15:58.151 --> 16:04.516
issues. Mr. McGovern. unfortunately, had a 
horrible time trying to find a vice presidential

16:07.711 --> 16:14.397
running mate. And he didn't have any idea. And 
every day at the convention, Senator Abraham

16:16.279 --> 16:22.685
Ribicoff turns McGovern down. Senator so-and-so 
turns him down. He names Senator Eagleton. And

16:27.890 --> 16:33.235
then it comes out Senator Eagleton had had shock 
treatment for nervous breakdown. So he went off

16:33.255 --> 16:34.917
the ticket. And then he finally got Sergeant 
Shriver, Senator Kennedy's brother-in-law, to

16:35.065 --> 16:41.412
come on the ticket. Well, by this time, the public 
perceived that McGovern couldn't even put a

16:41.432 --> 16:46.337
ticket together. How was he going to run the 
country? So there were a lot of really peripheral

16:49.040 --> 17:03.756
issues like that, not directly relating to the 
war, that caused the public to lose confidence

16:49.040 --> 17:03.756
that McGovern was equipped or capable of 
governing. or becoming president.

17:12.661 --> 17:31.920
Is there any particular action, if you had been 
able to take the war protesters, I know you say that

17:12.661 --> 17:31.920
they were doing things that were actually harmful 
to the movement itself, if you could have focused

17:12.661 --> 17:31.920
them in any one direction, in their public protest 
or whatever, what direction would you have headed

17:12.661 --> 17:31.920
them? What would you have had all these people, 
aside from supporting what y'all were trying to do

17:33.773 --> 17:45.668
in the Senate, what would you have them do in 
mainstream Americana, I guess? Well, bear in

17:45.688 --> 18:02.008
mind, all during this time, I was traveling the 
college campuses, Berkeley, Harvard, Stanford,

17:45.688 --> 18:02.008
all over the country, your major large 
universities as well as some of your smaller ones.

18:02.663 --> 18:10.072
And I had one simple theme, and that is that the 
focus was on Washington, DC. Everybody was trying

18:11.414 --> 18:15.780
to get to Washington, to have a demonstration in 
Washington. And my theme was, Washington is but a

18:17.061 --> 18:24.290
reflection of every main street in America. And 
they were missing the bet of not visiting the

18:25.592 --> 18:30.358
editors of their local papers, the leaders of 
their business community who were part of the

18:30.811 --> 18:45.445
National Chamber of Commerce, part of the 
National Association of Manufacturers, part of

18:30.811 --> 18:45.445
the AFL-CIO, who were passing these resolutions 
of support at the national level. And I said,

18:45.712 --> 18:51.418
they're but reflecting the feelings amongst 
their constituents out in these various

18:45.712 --> 18:51.418
communities. You don't have to come to Washington 
to have a protest. You don't have to come to

18:55.402 --> 18:59.146
Washington trying to persuade the change of 
policy. The policy in Washington is but a

18:59.166 --> 19:06.794
reflection of the attitudes and the viewpoints of 
the people living right in your own neighborhood,

18:59.166 --> 19:06.794
right in your own community. And that's where you 
should be putting your constructive persuasive

19:07.495 --> 19:12.941
protest. OK. Do you feel then because maybe they 
didn't put enough pressure on their local

19:15.597 --> 19:41.672
officials or even on their state and national 
elected officials, I sort of got the feeling from

19:15.597 --> 19:41.672
in general reading some of your book that people 
here in Washington were trying to protect their

19:15.597 --> 19:41.672
political futures and not doing what was best for 
America. Did you get that feeling? Well, I know

19:44.770 --> 20:01.569
that a lot of the members of Congress were not 
publicly expressing the same opinion that they

19:44.770 --> 20:01.569
were privately expressing in the cloakrooms and 
elsewhere, because they felt the public

19:44.770 --> 20:01.569
sentiment was behind the war. And at certain 
periods of this time, it certainly was behind the

20:03.011 --> 20:07.896
war. I believe it was tested out in Oregon that in 
1966, when I was running for the Senate, that about

20:08.062 --> 20:19.539
76% of the public did support the war. So these were 
great, overwhelming statistics that influenced

20:20.841 --> 20:34.440
an awful lot of people in public life who were 
dependent on that same constituency for their

20:20.841 --> 20:34.440
votes.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.904
In your book, you mentioned that you felt At as 
early as, well I guess Lyndon Johnson has stated

20:37.812 --> 20:53.416
that as early as 1964 he had plans for actually 
sending more troops in when publicly during his

20:37.812 --> 20:53.416
campaign he was saying he was not going to escalate 
the war. Do you feel that disinformation campaign

20:54.077 --> 21:06.216
contributed to the hotbed of protest or was it an 
attempt of his to actually combat the protest? I

21:06.668 --> 21:19.189
would have to speculate because I didn't have that 
kind of close relationship to know what Johnson

21:06.668 --> 21:19.189
was saying to his close advisors and what to 
contrast it with what he was saying publicly. But I

21:19.209 --> 21:32.372
do feel that the fact that later Mr. Nixon expanded 
the war after his 68 election where he said he had a

21:19.209 --> 21:32.372
secret plan to bring the war to an end, that he 
wasn't going to debate or discuss or announce in

21:32.723 --> 21:39.611
public until after he was elected. By the way, I 
wrote him a letter at that time and said that I had

21:39.631 --> 21:51.284
been named one of his surrogate candidates to 
campaign for him and authorized to speak on any

21:39.631 --> 21:51.284
issue on his behalf. And I said, I will have to, in 
effect, cease my involvement until you're

21:52.165 --> 21:58.933
willing to head on, take head on, the most 
fundamental, important issue of this campaign. I

22:06.031 --> 22:11.458
said, I just don't think people are going to buy a 
pig and a poke that you have some secret plan. Well,

22:11.478 --> 22:26.676
remember, after he was elected, he increased and 
expanded the war into Cambodia by starting the

22:11.478 --> 22:26.676
bombing of Cambodia, because he said there was a 
great communist cache of arms in Cambodia that

22:11.478 --> 22:26.676
were being used to against our fighting forces in 
Vietnam. Well, later they never did find the cache

22:30.982 --> 22:36.149
of arms that we talked about. And so when I used 
Nixon's action to expand the war into Cambodia, it

22:36.209 --> 22:56.376
would certainly then follow that, or it could 
follow that Johnson may have had ideas that were

22:36.209 --> 22:56.376
being sold to him about expanding the number of 
troops to bring the war to a quicker end. They kept

22:56.930 --> 23:00.314
talking about a light at the end of the tunnel. That 
was Secretary of Defense McNamara, Robert

23:00.354 --> 23:07.622
McNamara, phrased it, well, we see a light at the 
end of the tunnel. Well, that was when we had

23:07.983 --> 23:10.426
200,000 there. And when Johnson left office, it 
had escalated to 563,000. We were still seeing the

23:14.911 --> 23:18.615
light at the end of the tunnel as we escalated. So it 
would have followed in the pattern of Johnson's

23:18.635 --> 23:21.899
policy. I'll take you home. Johnson... Yes, sir. 
Johnson, in his administration, escalated the

23:27.662 --> 23:33.972
war. Remember, Kennedy sent the first... When 
Kennedy became president, there were only 600

23:36.716 --> 23:41.704
advisers that were left there by Eisenhower. And 
Eisenhower had resisted sending combat troops.

23:46.111 --> 23:50.899
And at that time, John Foster Dulles, his 
secretary of state, and later Christian Herder,

23:52.027 --> 23:58.476
and as well as Vice President Nixon were urging 
Eisenhower to send combat troops. And he refused.

24:01.260 --> 24:17.842
So when Kennedy then became president, he really, 
you might say, started the actual war, as far as the

24:01.260 --> 24:17.842
United States is concerned, by sending 17,000 
combat troops

24:01.260 --> 24:17.842
there. And then when Johnson came in, But in that 
period of Johnson's administration, it was a

24:21.963 --> 24:35.202
consistent pattern of escalating, always that 
McNamara and the generals were saying, another

24:21.963 --> 24:35.202
10,000, another 20,000, and we can bring the war to 
a quicker end. And it finally got up to 500, and as I

24:35.943 --> 24:41.611
recall, 43,000 or 63,000, in excess of 500,000. So 
it could well have fallen in that pattern.

24:47.559 --> 24:48.240
Do you... You've stated in the book as well as in 
other places that you feel under no circumstances

24:50.262 --> 25:01.618
should you break the law to try and make a point. You 
state in the book you do not agree with civil

25:01.718 --> 25:04.982
disobedience. What were your personal feelings? 
Let me clarify that a little bit. I do think there's

25:10.991 --> 25:19.122
a right of civil disobedience provided you don't 
use force and violence. and provided that you

25:20.063 --> 25:24.770
stand accountable for your action of civil 
disobedience. The idea of committing an act of

25:24.850 --> 25:31.981
civil disobedience and running, I did not agree 
with. But I think the right of conscience gives to

25:33.223 --> 25:44.620
any American the right to disobey the law, 
provided it is a nonviolent, action and that one

25:45.933 --> 25:54.365
then stands ready to suffer the penalty of that 
disobedience.

25:54.385 --> 26:10.288
So on the I mean a certain situation such as burning 
a draft card refusing to if drafted to go into

25:54.385 --> 26:10.288
service if they were willing to accept the penalty 
of their spending the time in jail but not running

25:54.385 --> 26:10.288
off to camp. That's right.
