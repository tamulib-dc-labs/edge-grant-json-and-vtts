WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:04.894
Describe his manner of leadership. Very 
congenial. Had a few basic meetings with all the

00:10.822 --> 00:14.287
departments. Would sometimes come to our own 
particular faculty meeting and share his view. We

00:20.656 --> 00:29.049
were always made to feel important. He made us all 
feel important and he shared If he had something,

00:32.667 --> 00:43.003
some publications on foundations, he would send 
them to me, and I suspect he did that to everybody in

00:32.667 --> 00:43.003
the field, his wide reading. But he was a leader 
that allowed more freedom, I think, for the

00:44.425 --> 00:52.718
faculty, slightly more freedom. How much of him 
did you see physically? Not a lot, no. We were all so

00:59.762 --> 01:09.355
busy in our own little worlds that we kept—but he 
was always available. I think he had some sessions

01:09.375 --> 01:15.824
up on the eighth floor to talk to people and share 
ideas. Very accessible. Who were the key members

01:18.888 --> 01:21.692
of his staff?

01:24.946 --> 01:32.414
I think he continued having Ritchie as a secretary 
and Brian Cole. Okay. What role did Brian play,

01:34.897 --> 01:36.799
really? Was he kind of the chief of staff? I 
pictured him as that. Of course, he has a West Point

01:40.983 --> 01:45.208
background, so that would fit. But Brian is just a 
remarkable person, and I think we're very lucky to

01:46.129 --> 01:54.598
have him as a person in the background. Very 
efficient. Everything he does is well done. But he

02:01.548 --> 02:04.412
complimented Dean Corrigan. Meanwhile, over at 
the presidential level, Dr. Williams had been

02:05.854 --> 02:15.729
replaced by Jarvis Miller and then Frank Vandiver 
and so forth. How did you and your colleagues, what

02:16.530 --> 02:21.837
did you all think about these changes at the 
presidential level? Did that affect education

02:21.857 --> 02:23.640
much? I don't think it affected education. We were 
all very sorry. Of course, Williams went to be

02:30.551 --> 02:36.621
chancellor, but we lost his input here. I always 
liked Jarvis Miller. As I say, I was president of

02:40.447 --> 02:47.097
TAC, the Texas Association of College Teachers, 
when he came and he joined us, which was, I thought,

02:47.431 --> 02:55.629
very nice because a lot of administrators thought 
that was a little subversive. But it was really an

02:56.671 --> 03:02.183
organization to help faculty, faculty 
standards.

03:03.344 --> 03:08.771
I believe that he wanted all the faculty to be in 
their office all the time. I'm not sure about my

03:08.811 --> 03:18.563
facts on that now, but he saw a man, was he in 
history, that was running around all the time in

03:08.811 --> 03:18.563
shorts? He died a few years ago. Lloyd Taylor. 
Lloyd Taylor, fine man. But he saw somebody

03:22.829 --> 03:27.094
running when it was not the noon hour. That's a 
rumor I heard. But I always liked him very much. And

03:31.125 --> 03:35.825
Vanderveer, of course, was an outstanding 
president. Again, I was president of TAC that

03:35.845 --> 03:39.460
year. and we had trouble getting him to speak to us. 
He was so busy. I remember there were a lot of times

03:45.651 --> 03:53.845
where he had to cancel out, but he always helped 
with tech. Now that's a general faculty

03:53.865 --> 03:57.231
organization. As far as the College of Education 
is concerned, I don't believe there was any

04:02.187 --> 04:04.955
feeling that there was a change. They were always 
supportive. Let's see, so you served under how

04:08.485 --> 04:11.294
many deans? Only two, really? You mean of 
education? Well, I believe that Limbacher was—

04:17.155 --> 04:20.761
Oh, I forgot Phil. Phil Limbacher was— So Hubert, 
and then Limbacher— Limbacher. And then— And then

04:25.289 --> 04:29.095
Dean Corrigan. Okay. And then about the time I was 
retiring, it was Lady Dean and I— Yeah, but that was

04:29.616 --> 04:36.688
very brief. Yes, I was half-time and then retired. 
And then Dean Connolly now, who's a very lovely

04:40.797 --> 04:44.301
lady.

04:48.506 --> 04:55.293
Looking at the presidential level, I'm not going 
to ask you the negative, to which presidents would

04:48.506 --> 04:55.293
you give highest grades that you served under? Oh, 
President Williams. Yes, without question.

05:06.025 --> 05:11.492
A historic figure, I think, in the history of 
higher education. Just a fine man. Now, he's

05:13.815 --> 05:15.537
buried at Clemson, isn't he? Yes. My children went 
to Clemson. They never sold the first house they

05:21.405 --> 05:34.902
built as junior faculty members, and when he died 
in Houston, Mrs. Williams then went back to that

05:21.405 --> 05:34.902
house, and that's where she's living now. Well, if 
I get back to Clemson one time, I'll see if I can

05:34.882 --> 05:40.089
check with her. Oh, she'd be delighted to see you. 
She's still bright as can be. Well, I can't

05:44.375 --> 05:48.400
remember anyone better. I served under some good 
college presidents, Gideons of Brooklyn.

05:56.010 --> 05:58.093
I brought that folder of his inauguration. You 
probably have copies of that. I was also a delegate

06:01.460 --> 06:06.309
for Miller's inauguration. As I say, after Miller 
retired, I knew him where my mother was at Walden,

06:08.193 --> 06:15.848
the retirement home. He did a very nice job there. 
Did you go to commencements very often at A&M? Yes,

06:22.759 --> 06:29.530
and I got tired of counting all the bodies that were 
going by. Describe, make believe I had never been

06:29.650 --> 06:33.175
to an A&M commencement. Describe an A&M 
commencement. Well, it's

06:34.597 --> 06:43.971
really part of the tradition where you go, we take 
turns, we would get our gowns on and get lined up.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.226
The students were lined up in mass. It was a 
marvelous maneuver. Then we would march in and sit

06:52.291 --> 06:54.254
up in front. Then we had the name calling. What was 
that man that had such a nice voice? In physical

07:01.925 --> 07:03.868
education. Yeah. I see him around. Well, anyway, 
his voice would ring and he would get the most

07:12.048 --> 07:17.237
unusual names pronounced correctly somehow. But 
it was rather an endless procession. Roger

07:20.062 --> 07:20.903
Fellman. Roger Fellman, wonderful man, Roger 
Fellman. But we would get this procession, and of

07:25.130 --> 07:35.929
course as faculty all eyes were on us, so we had to 
keep pretty alert. But instead, I always thought

07:36.533 --> 07:45.656
that being a professor was less a profession than a 
procession. What did you and your colleagues do to

07:46.999 --> 07:54.357
stay awake while all of the graduates' names were 
being called out? Well, I sometimes would figure

07:55.535 --> 08:08.271
out how many a minute would pass, and I would work on 
little formulas to see if I could pick up the right

07:55.535 --> 08:08.271
number. I also went to graduations as part of the 
audience, too, and the advantage of that was you

08:10.915 --> 08:21.348
could see what the students had written on their 
hats. Do you remember any? They were always there

08:23.391 --> 08:25.153
for jobs. high bomb or something like that. If you 
were behind them, you could see that. As a faculty

08:30.698 --> 08:35.823
member, you didn't get to see the top of their head. 
Of course, we knew what was in their heads. My

08:38.305 --> 08:42.449
favorite was the one that a kid put up one day, Hell 
Froze Over.

08:45.872 --> 08:46.893
Oh, that's a good one. Do you remember any 
commencement speakers?

08:55.930 --> 09:00.276
You know, I can't even remember what was said. I'm 
sure that, did you speak one time? Yes. I think I

09:03.661 --> 09:05.023
remember. That was the day before Jarvis failed to 
shake hands with Melanie Zintracht. I was not at

09:11.833 --> 09:13.475
that occasion. That was Saturday. I spoke on 
Friday afternoon. Well, I may have. By the way, you

09:20.506 --> 09:25.191
spoke at the Kappa Delta Pi one time. I found the 
folder. Oh, my goodness, a lot of it. If you need it

09:27.814 --> 09:29.396
for your biographer. Oh, oh. All right, well, let 
me mention, any kind of material like that, if you

09:31.198 --> 09:42.070
ever want to get rid of it, please pass it on to the 
archives. Right, and they also ask me for course

09:42.421 --> 09:49.223
material sometimes too, and I haven't gotten that 
put together. Yes, because otherwise things like

09:49.243 --> 09:52.212
that get thrown away. And here's a repository that 
will be there forever. Do you remember the Rudder

09:55.935 --> 09:58.579
Lecture Series? Yes. I've got some newspaper 
clippings on that, too, if you'd like to have them.

10:03.265 --> 10:03.946
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I'll dig them out. All right. 
Remember when we had President Williams and we

10:06.971 --> 10:12.399
were waiting for Jacques Barzun? He was still on 
the – he wouldn't fly, and we were trying to hold the

10:12.459 --> 10:19.549
audience and Yours truly had to go meet him in a car. 
You were in the car. I was with President Williams,

10:22.839 --> 10:35.767
and we were trying to talk, and we kept giving word 
to the audience that we had just heard they were

10:22.839 --> 10:35.767
coming in through Caldwell or something like 
that. I guess you must have been calling. He's just

10:37.130 --> 10:41.414
been elected to the Texas Institute of Letters. He 
has retired and lives in San Antonio now. I think

10:45.097 --> 10:48.540
that he just wrote this powerful book, didn't he? 
The History of the World or something. I haven't

10:50.962 --> 10:52.624
seen it yet. I just loved his lectures, but he never 
submitted the manuscripts, did he? No, he would

10:56.968 --> 10:59.550
not do so. Well, I have the newspaper clippings if 
you would like them. Yes. Other lecturers you

11:07.117 --> 11:13.546
remember, other visitors to the campus, 
celebrities throughout these years? Well, of

11:13.627 --> 11:18.734
course, Seberg was the next one who was kind of a 
disaster, to say the least. But in education, we

11:19.495 --> 11:27.287
had several fine ones in the centennial year. 
Butts, R. Freeman Butts of Columbia. was one of our

11:34.437 --> 11:37.581
speakers. He's still living, as far as I know, must 
be in his 90s. And we had Brody, a foundation man

11:43.327 --> 11:56.142
from Illinois, who gave a great presentation.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.762
We're not on tape now, are we? Yes, yes, yes. I don't 
want to hesitate. In the old days, long-distance

12:01.646 --> 12:09.074
phone calls made me so nervous because I wanted to 
be sure to get it all out in three minutes. Oh, no,

12:09.214 --> 12:10.435
no, that's no worry. We had just marvelous 
speakers here, and faculty. Remember the yearly

12:16.802 --> 12:21.808
lecture of an outstanding faculty member? I 
remember this group in 1972 or 73 called the

12:21.788 --> 12:35.789
Antiquarians, and Bill Allen

12:21.788 --> 12:35.789
got that going. I have some of his letters that are 
just absolutely hilarious as he introduces the

12:35.889 --> 12:42.218
next group. He's back at L.A. I heard from him 
recently. His wife died and he's been not well. Now

12:48.367 --> 12:54.333
who became your, during all these years, who 
became your closest faculty friends? Well, Glenn

12:54.513 --> 12:56.776
Johnson, I think Bob Schutz. Bob Schutz died four 
years ago. And I was divorced in 1978, and so that

13:00.499 --> 13:09.989
hurt my social life. And then I remarried. the lady 
taught at Pan American and she never lived here, so

13:14.033 --> 13:20.465
that was a little bit... So I kind of went out of the 
social swim. But on campus, who were your close

13:26.456 --> 13:29.061
friends? Well, Dick Costas always. We now have a 
knot-holers club with Tom Chandler, who's, of

13:32.107 --> 13:43.120
course, suffering from Parkinson's, and Clint 
Phillips, and a few others. And we meet every two

13:43.240 --> 13:47.225
weeks to discuss the state of baseball. But Dick 
Cost, over the years, was my best friend outside of

13:48.226 --> 13:53.112
the department. Of course, Bill Allen, when he was 
here. We were classmates together at Cornell.

14:02.330 --> 14:06.755
But every faculty member was very friendly. And I 
got to know a lot of them through tact. But then in

14:10.059 --> 14:14.084
the last 10 or 15 years, I've been out of the swim.

14:17.488 --> 14:24.376
Looking back over all these years, what were some 
of the happiest moments you recall as an Aggie

14:17.488 --> 14:24.376
faculty member? Well, I think I was always happy. I 
worked hard, but I always felt very happy here.

14:31.807 --> 14:36.981
There was something about A&M that the students 
reinforced this. What contributed to all that

14:38.526 --> 14:41.213
positive feeling? I don't even when I was 
divorced. I mean, I went through a terrible

14:43.340 --> 14:45.083
depression. But I just still had the feeling of 
belonging to a great university. But of course,

14:55.341 --> 15:00.310
happiness is a state of mind which probably is not 
completely environmental. I think I just had that

15:01.632 --> 15:05.479
kind of nature.

15:07.737 --> 15:12.146
But these have been the happiest times of my life. 
Now other happy experiences, I think probably a

15:12.206 --> 15:20.262
very happy experience is every semester when the 
semester's over. And you can say, sort of sigh and

15:23.448 --> 15:29.534
say, well now I don't have to get ready for the next 
day right away. Those were all happy times. And all

15:33.458 --> 15:36.901
the happy memories of students. These students 
were very fine.

15:42.586 --> 15:49.573
Have there been times when a student would, a 
former student would write you a letter or stop you

15:42.586 --> 15:49.573
somewhere and thank you for? Well, oh yes. Since 
I've been retired, students remember me better

15:53.075 --> 15:57.628
than when they had me. How do they? Well, they tell 
my wife what a fine teacher I was or something like

15:59.192 --> 16:05.048
that. I remember when I won the teaching award, I 
had students write me and ask for money,

16:05.450 --> 16:17.050
jokingly. You're talking about this— No, no, it 
was just the $2,000

16:17.410 --> 16:26.125
award. But I didn't get a watch. How did you learn 
you had won that? Not until I was sitting in the

16:30.502 --> 16:38.983
faculty meeting, and I was very embarrassed 
because one time I didn't wear a suit coat. And I had

16:39.723 --> 16:46.918
no idea until Brian Cole said, he's famous for 
pontificating. And with that coined word, I

16:47.980 --> 16:56.537
suddenly thought, gosh, that's striking pretty 
close. That was, I think, definitely the

16:56.597 --> 16:59.503
happiest. I also won a teaching award when the 
civilian students had an award earlier in the 70s.

17:08.895 --> 17:21.411
But yes, I think that was the happiest time, 
because we generally wonder if we ever have done

17:08.895 --> 17:21.411
any good and if we can be recognized for anything. 
And that was monumental. Of all your research,

17:23.354 --> 17:26.638
what were you most proud? I think probably of my 
creation of the sociobiography, which I was

17:29.150 --> 17:47.478
trying to develop as a new genre for a combination 
of biography and sociology, at the development of

17:29.150 --> 17:47.478
the International Society for Educational 
Biography. And I think that has become important

17:47.498 --> 17:51.984
in the long run. The society is still going strong, 
not to anything I'm doing. Right now I'm mainly

17:57.820 --> 18:00.023
just doing fiction. I've gone back to what I wanted 
to do before I went into teaching. Are you

18:04.951 --> 18:06.493
publishing any of it? No, I haven't published 
anything. I like to write more than I try to figure

18:08.015 --> 18:17.129
out the markets, but I'm writing short stories now 
because my memory is getting shorter. As you look

18:19.752 --> 18:23.558
back on these years at A&M, Did the College of 
Education miss any opportunities? Are there any

18:28.164 --> 18:34.178
things that now you think could have been done that 
for some reason didn't get done? Well, as I say, we

18:36.523 --> 18:39.690
could have had a stronger foundations 
development, which to me is so important. If we're

18:46.960 --> 18:57.054
going to develop a profession, I think we need to 
have more theoretical roots and a better

18:46.960 --> 18:57.054
understanding of what has been done rather than 
keep reinventing the wheel.

19:01.600 --> 19:06.066
We never really took off the ground there, except 
for the things I did, and I made a very small

19:06.046 --> 19:10.153
contribution. But I think the education 
department was very, very strong, and I think what

19:10.353 --> 19:15.522
they were doing was outstanding.

19:18.106 --> 19:25.018
The problem of education, of course, is that it's 
much too complex for anybody. Everybody's

19:25.078 --> 19:30.467
different, and we don't have a single law. of 
gravity. And even gravity, I understand, doesn't

19:32.410 --> 19:35.534
work all the time anymore either. But it's such a 
very complex field that I think it's not a science.

19:41.802 --> 19:45.006
And I think attempts to make it a science are 
worthy. But it still comes back down to its

19:45.627 --> 19:49.432
humanistic roots, I think. And that is what the 
Foundation's tried to cultivate. As far as you

19:55.220 --> 20:07.238
know, if we ranked all the programs in education in 
the nation today, where

19:55.220 --> 20:07.238
would A&M be? and relative general grouping? I 
think right up at the top. I don't think there's any

20:12.260 --> 20:14.042
question about that. Of course, I haven't been 
keeping up for the last nine years. But I think it's

20:19.007 --> 20:33.560
my experiences at Columbia, Brooklyn College, 
and my trips to Stanford and Iowa and other

20:19.007 --> 20:33.560
conventions. I think what we're doing here is 
right up at the very top. If we could group all the

20:37.323 --> 20:51.235
people together, call them back, all the people 
that you dealt with here in education and

20:37.323 --> 20:51.235
elsewhere in the university, to whom would you be 
most grateful? Who would you want to thank most?

20:54.558 --> 20:55.959
Not just students. Not just students. Well, I 
think

20:57.261 --> 21:05.608
that's a very fine question.

21:07.748 --> 21:10.372
There's so many people that we would need to thank. 
I would thank Glenn Johnson for bringing me here,

21:10.492 --> 21:17.462
and Dean Hubert for helping me grow. Demanding 
that I grow is a nice way of them. And

21:23.891 --> 21:27.916
so many of the colleagues. But I think, again, it's 
our students that make the whole thing work. And I

21:32.042 --> 21:35.427
would like to thank all my students. I've had some 
very good ones, and of course I'm proud of most of

21:37.212 --> 21:40.876
them. I didn't always know what I was trying to get 
at, and sometimes I didn't either, but I'd like to

21:41.277 --> 21:48.686
thank them. I've just about run out of questions. 
Are there some topics we have not covered that we

21:51.589 --> 21:54.173
should have? No. What extra departmental 
activities? What service groups were you? Well, I

22:03.827 --> 22:10.529
did work with the Rutter Lecture Series and then on 
the Centennial Committee with you. And one of the

22:11.773 --> 22:14.863
lecture series that I developed along with 
another person. It was the Aiken. It was our

22:23.083 --> 22:24.244
Senator Aiken. Gilmer Aiken? Gilmer Aiken. But it 
also had, I put it down. My

22:30.612 --> 22:35.737
memory is just not trustworthy. Stennett. 
Stennett. He was one of our very famous. at

22:43.548 --> 22:53.550
administration, who was the founder of so many 
evaluation developments and higher standards in

22:43.548 --> 22:53.550
education, Stennett Aiken. Aiken Stennett. We 
developed a lecture series and brought in Maxine

22:54.832 --> 23:00.645
Green, who was a cult figure in education. and 
Kineller from UCLA.

23:06.574 --> 23:11.481
It didn't continue, but I was very proud of work in 
that area. And, of course, my TACT activities

23:12.623 --> 23:21.857
outside of the College of Education. Well, I was 
president of TACT when the Senate came along, and I

23:22.242 --> 23:28.990
was surprised the Senate didn't contact us on 
that. But TACT was always small, maybe 100 people.

23:36.839 --> 23:43.187
Then I, of course, with advancing age,

23:45.496 --> 23:46.237
slowed down. I've just tried to keep up with 
research in the field of history of children and

23:46.257 --> 23:55.289
also in qualitative research, the key to it. I 
think biography is essentially as close as we can

23:55.629 --> 24:01.657
get to good solid qualitative research. If you 
were brought in as a consultant to the department

24:02.598 --> 24:12.972
and then to the college today, what advice would 
you give them for A&M's programs to be even better

24:13.441 --> 24:20.414
in EDC&I and the College of Education. What advice 
would you give them? Well, I don't think I'd want to

24:22.857 --> 24:25.639
give advice. I would like to ask what we mean by 
better. I

24:33.306 --> 24:47.579
was also on this evaluation committee for the 
university, and our service and research and

24:33.306 --> 24:47.579
teaching was our major field. Well, what is better 
teaching? I wouldn't advise on that. Although I

24:51.376 --> 25:00.166
have various theories, but I think we would have to 
have a lot of alternative teaching devices

24:51.376 --> 25:00.166
because people are so different. Research, I 
would advise continual stressing of research. I

25:08.415 --> 25:19.628
might advise that there some could be more 
teaching professors who would love teaching and

25:08.415 --> 25:19.628
not require them to do a lot of research, give them 
more teaching. and if they love that, and not have

25:20.182 --> 25:26.269
them research or lose their position because they 
haven't published. And as far as service is

25:27.530 --> 25:42.547
concerned, I think we need to get closer and closer 
to the community and to the nation, not being

25:27.530 --> 25:42.547
dependent upon the nation for funding all the 
time, but at least to make sure that it's relevant.

25:42.948 --> 25:46.712
But I would more like to have them tell me what 
they're doing. I don't think I'd be a very good

25:47.603 --> 25:50.206
consultant. I'm too indirect. In terms of the 
sheer size of the program, would you suggest any

25:53.630 --> 25:58.175
changes there? I think it's gotten a little bit too 
big. I yearned for those days when we were a family.

26:09.307 --> 26:12.531
We wanted to be a community of scholars and a 
community of students. And it's hard to do in a big

26:13.220 --> 26:15.523
fashion. And yet, it's more economical. I think it 
might be possible to develop maybe smaller

26:18.147 --> 26:22.994
communities within. Of course, our colleges are 
that. But within the colleges, try to develop some

26:25.638 --> 26:33.549
centers for community interest to develop. But I 
think when you get up to over 40,000, it becomes

26:33.569 --> 26:41.961
more like a factory, even without the whistle. All 
right, then, I've got only two left. And the next

26:49.087 --> 27:01.524
last one is, if someone walked up to you and gave you 
a check for a million dollars with one requirement

26:49.087 --> 27:01.524
that you had to pass it on to Texas A&M, what would 
you want A&M to do with that money which you gave

26:49.087 --> 27:01.524
them? You can make the decision. Well, initially, 
my first thought would be scholarships for needy

27:05.048 --> 27:10.716
students. In what areas? Well, of course, 
education is my field, but if I had a million

27:13.842 --> 27:29.818
dollars to give to the university, I think it 
should be divided into various areas as

27:13.842 --> 27:29.818
scholarships for any in each of the colleges. When 
you said for needy students. Well, let me take that

27:35.488 --> 27:39.215
back. I think for outstanding students.

27:45.388 --> 27:46.690
Yes, the best. All right, the last question. What 
feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M

27:49.456 --> 27:52.482
today? Well, to me, this is the height of my career. 
And I want to stay here as long as I can and be part of

27:59.314 --> 28:06.562
it. I'm still a professor emeritus. I still have an 
office. And I'm still on a committee or two.

28:15.011 --> 28:16.613
Probably I'll never finish. But I'd like to finish 
here, which I consider the best part of my career

28:17.200 --> 28:23.787
and life. That's a good thing.
