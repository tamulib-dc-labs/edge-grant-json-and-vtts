WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:02.746
Yeah, go ahead. You were telling us about his 
recruiting. Yeah, about Charlie Moran. Well, we

00:08.515 --> 00:19.071
used to play two games a week with Texas at that time 
because they were the big money, big gates. And

00:20.373 --> 00:27.805
Charlie beat Texas University so regular that it 
hurt them. They couldn't stand it. And it wound up

00:30.288 --> 00:35.933
into a big street fight down there in Houston after 
the game. And we run all the Texas University guys

00:37.314 --> 00:41.918
off the Houston streets because we were all in 
uniform. We knew what we were doing. In fact, I

00:43.599 --> 00:59.653
think in all that disturbance, we came back to 
College Station with about five

00:43.599 --> 00:59.653
revolvers that we took off of the police that tried 
to stop us. and their badges and their blackjacks.

01:10.551 --> 01:20.500
So after about three years of that, both schools 
were suffering because they missed that gate. And

01:22.702 --> 01:23.663
they got together. The athletic

01:24.384 --> 01:30.349
council from both schools got together. talked it 
over and Texas said they wouldn't play us unless we

01:30.515 --> 01:45.831
got rid of Charlie Moran

01:30.515 --> 01:45.831
and that was the upshot of that. We gave Charlie a 
farewell dress parade in the winter there when it

01:45.871 --> 01:59.205
was pouring down pouring down rain and I'm telling 
you it's one of the One of the things I'll always

01:59.742 --> 02:16.284
remember, we rode him, we rode, we put Charlie on a 
wagon, and he and Mrs. Moran and Tommy, he was a

01:59.742 --> 02:16.284
little boy there, a boy about that, like that, rode 
him down to the railroad station. They were

02:16.304 --> 02:23.313
leaving there on that four, that three or four 
o'clock train that came through there at that time

02:16.304 --> 02:23.313
going north, H&TC. Well, they, uh, We played, 
first game we played was in 1915, and we played at

02:28.987 --> 02:36.175
College Station. That was one of the agreements 
they made, that they would play alternately at A&M

02:36.295 --> 02:45.305
and at Texas University. So that first game, just 
before the game, this new coach that we had said,

02:45.325 --> 02:52.974
boys, I want to read you a telegram. And he says,

03:03.260 --> 03:07.466
He says, go out there and kick the hell out of them 
for old Charlie.

03:12.633 --> 03:17.319
Charlie.

03:17.339 --> 03:18.281
Yeah, they sure did.

03:21.906 --> 03:25.711
Go on with the branding incident. Well, that led up 
to the branding incident. So when they got talking

03:31.542 --> 03:46.218
about, you want to brand him, that steer with that 
20 to 3 brand, we were sitting up there in a board

03:31.542 --> 03:46.218
session like you do, still do, I'm sure. And we got 
talking back around about, let's go over there and

03:46.239 --> 03:51.164
brand that steer. And it was right between 
semesters, end of January, somewhere along

03:51.184 --> 03:59.153
there, wasn't that, that mid-term semester end. 
And we got talking about what we'd do, and he said,

04:00.955 --> 04:06.321
let's go over there and burn him. They said, nobody 
seems to know what to do about it. I said, well, I

04:09.846 --> 04:12.429
know what to do about it. And I spent enough time. I 
said, I know what we'll need. He says, all we need is

04:18.115 --> 04:29.629
a good string of rope, a couple of running irons, 
and I said, get a

04:30.149 --> 04:40.824
a

04:30.149 --> 04:40.824
plumber's pot, one of those heating pots, I think 
we can heat them irons on a plumber's pot. And that

04:42.846 --> 04:50.217
one of the guys was in there, his father was a 
contractor in Waco by the name of O.K. Johnson. And

04:51.919 --> 04:52.500
O.K. says, I know where to get that. He says, we got 
all that kind of equipment. And he says, I'll

04:57.507 --> 04:59.329
furnish the car. Well, when a man says he furnished 
a car at that time, back in 1915, that was

05:00.068 --> 05:05.375
something.

05:07.498 --> 05:22.257
So we all decided, we said, well, let's ask for a 
little leave of absence for a couple of days, and

05:07.498 --> 05:22.257
we'll go on up to Waco and get our equipment and slip 
down to Austin that evening, and we'll put the

05:07.498 --> 05:22.257
brand on. We went down there, and Abe Bull, you may 
have met Abe, I don't know him. Abe got to be a pretty

05:29.903 --> 05:31.605
big boy. He'd come out of Austin and married into a 
banker's family and succeeded the family in the

05:32.847 --> 05:45.764
office, became chairman of the board there at the 
time of his death. But Abe was just a sort of a teller

05:45.784 --> 05:52.392
or something in there about that time. Or maybe he 
wasn't even married, he was just still. And Abe

05:57.139 --> 05:59.742
said, now don't mention my name as having anything 
to do about this brand he said, because I'm living

06:00.228 --> 06:07.497
over

06:00.228 --> 06:07.497
there. So we never did mention the name in there 
about having anything to do with that brand.

06:14.485 --> 06:15.847
But we slept in there. Oh, we got in there about 7 
o'clock at night.

06:24.157 --> 06:30.184
And he knew where they kept him down there and they 
had a barn. down there where they kept him. Of

06:31.710 --> 06:34.893
course, there was nothing to it but putting a brand 
on him. Just went down there and threw a loop on him,

06:34.933 --> 06:47.666
snared him up to a post and went down and looped him 
around his iron legs and pulled him down and tied

06:34.933 --> 06:47.666
him up. Got a heating pot, good and hot, put irons in 
there and put a red big 13 to nothing brand on him.

06:57.336 --> 06:58.197
Branded him from from his shoulder, went back to 
his hip.

07:07.359 --> 07:17.510
There was a young fellow down there on the campus, a 
photographer. He went to school there. But he was a

07:20.394 --> 07:26.380
pretty fair photographer. And he went over there 
and took a picture of him. And when we got back to

07:29.716 --> 07:35.664
Waco, that's when we got our first publicity on 
that deal. We got in there, and there was old Jim

07:36.946 --> 07:43.255
Grove. Of course, Jim and his family is an old 
family in Waco, too. They operated a laundry there

07:49.723 --> 07:53.689
for years and years. And we were down there on the 
street, And there's a young fella came up there,

07:58.606 --> 08:14.567
and he knew Jim, and got talking and talking, and 
Jim was telling him what we had done, that we'd just

07:58.606 --> 08:14.567
been down to Austin and branded that Longhorn 
still. And he, oh, he was very much interested. He

08:20.995 --> 08:22.797
said, I want to get the story for the paper. Got all 
that in there, and then he took us out to Cameron

08:24.340 --> 08:27.043
Park and snapped a bunch of pictures,

08:27.732 --> 08:40.624
and wrote up the story, and it came out, and all the 
other papers got a rerun on it. It'd run in all the

08:40.644 --> 08:42.326
papers, and it'd run. San Antonio paper, Houston 
paper, Dallas paper. Nobody ever saw you while you

08:48.732 --> 08:51.714
were over there doing it? No. Oh, no way. Did you do 
it at night? Yeah, at night. About what time? It was

08:58.399 --> 08:59.400
about midnight. About midnight. About midnight. 
It was close to midnight. I know it was, oh, man, it

09:04.206 --> 09:07.470
was a... It was one of them clear, briskly cold 
nights. You know, everything just twinkled,

09:12.536 --> 09:16.321
frosty as it could be.

09:21.788 --> 09:25.272
Well, was there much excitement after everybody 
found out what you'd done? Oh, uh... It rankled

09:27.740 --> 09:35.750
Austin, the student body over there, 
terrifically. I know they, we went over there just

09:35.770 --> 09:41.517
a short while over after that to play basketball. 
And rolled over there on the whole cadet corps went

09:43.359 --> 09:52.430
over there. It almost wound up into a, into a, into a 
big, fight right there on the basketball field

09:58.098 --> 10:14.256
inside the

09:58.098 --> 10:14.256
gym where they played the game.

10:14.276 --> 10:15.277
Oh, gee, they were mad. There were a couple of 
basketball, a couple of football players.

10:21.684 --> 10:23.686
I remember that one, Texas University. Was his 
name McCollum? McCollum or some such name. He just

10:28.726 --> 10:29.968
jumped up and down. We were sitting right here. I 
had a seat right on the floor of the gym, and right

10:35.415 --> 10:43.867
across the court on the other side was a bunch of 
football players over there. They were just

10:46.010 --> 10:52.298
hollering at one another the whole

10:46.010 --> 10:52.298
time. And what year now did you graduate? 1917. 
What did you do after you graduated? Wasn't there,

10:59.219 --> 10:59.980
Army? Practically the entire senior class

11:02.423 --> 11:08.651
went into service. There were a few for special 
reasons that couldn't leave right then, but I

11:09.532 --> 11:23.169
think at least 95% of them went right into service. 
From then, when I got out of the service, I came down

11:24.891 --> 11:28.956
here and went to farming. Where were you stationed 
then when you were in the service? What did you do? I

11:34.477 --> 11:38.761
was in the 64th Infantry, regular army. And where 
were you most of that time? Well, on this side, I was

11:42.365 --> 11:47.650
stationed for a while at Fort Bliss. And I was also, 
later when we were brigaded, just before we moved

11:48.851 --> 11:58.740
across, we were brigaded at Waco. forget what they 
called that army post there. And from there we

12:06.921 --> 12:14.869
moved right on up to Hoboken where we caught the 
boat.

12:16.750 --> 12:17.511
Where did you land? At Brest.

12:22.316 --> 12:26.580
It's an old army barracks of Brest. They said it was 
a barracks about that uh where um caesar at the time

12:31.053 --> 13:00.503
of his invasion of england where he took off when he 
went across the channel did you see any combat

12:31.053 --> 13:00.503
while you were there yes we were in combat for uh 
just we came in on the tail end of it and we got over

12:31.053 --> 13:00.503
there in september and went right into the line 
then we stayed there until it was a holding deal It

13:01.900 --> 13:03.402
was a holding deal there. It had quieted down. Real 
active fighting had kind of moved around because

13:06.185 --> 13:12.433
they were almost stalemated. They were run right 
up against a heavy

13:12.473 --> 13:21.645
fortified area right around Brest. Brest was an 
old German army setup. It was heavily, very

13:27.773 --> 13:31.317
heavily fortified. and it had brought the, it had 
brought the, you might say the,

13:31.870 --> 13:44.728
our advance to a standstill, and they were moving 
around toward the left. And they left us there to

13:46.551 --> 13:57.326
hold until, until they could weaken fresh, I'd 
say, action. And then we could move in. We were due

13:59.288 --> 14:00.510
to move in We were due to move in on the 11th of 
November. And I know on the 11th, when we were still

14:06.475 --> 14:22.453
on the line there, on the holding position, just 
artillery

14:06.475 --> 14:22.453
and a little skirmish upon the line. That's all 
that amounted to. I remember how quiet that

14:29.060 --> 14:38.531
artillery sound got it on the limo. It just kept 
getting more quiet, more quiet until it stopped.

14:44.799 --> 14:48.803
And I mean when it stopped it looked like it just 
made more noise than ever. After you've been

14:50.145 --> 14:58.695
sitting in artillery area or offense for about 60 
days, it really gets quiet when it stops or it gets

14:59.418 --> 15:07.787
loud. And

15:08.408 --> 15:15.336
you came then to the valley here after World War I. 
And you went to farming? Yeah. What did you farm?

15:18.920 --> 15:20.402
What were your major crops? Oh, I grew some general 
field crops and vegetables. At that time, the, uh,

15:28.915 --> 15:37.507
the, uh, Cetrus deal had not developed. It was a 
little before the Cetrus deal developed. And then

15:41.632 --> 15:55.451
I, uh, I, uh, like I say, after I formed a while, I 
never had formed in my life until I came down here.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.095
But after I found out, got on to how it was supposed 
to be done, I got to making some money out of it. And,

16:04.764 --> 16:08.707
like I said, after I made some money, I got into the 
stock market. Then I traded my deal down here for

16:08.727 --> 16:17.555
some property in Dallas and hit that just in the 
time of the Depression and lost it up there. Came

16:17.575 --> 16:20.959
back with my pocket junkie. What'd you do then? 
Then what'd you do? Your flat broke then, so you

16:25.122 --> 16:28.065
couldn't start over? What I did after that? Yeah. 
That's what I said. I saw the footloose. I wasn't

16:37.734 --> 16:50.729
able to establish any claim to a job with the 
Extension Department.

16:52.051 --> 16:58.879
And that friend of mine says, if you want to go in the 
beer business, I'll set you up. And I went into the

17:01.643 --> 17:03.886
beer bin this far. What year was this that you went 
into the beer bin? That was in about 34. 34. So it's

17:08.632 --> 17:10.053
after it became legal again. Yeah. And so what'd 
you do? You opened up a tavern. Mm-hmm. How long did

17:15.060 --> 17:17.943
you keep your tavern? Until about 40, 45. I sold out 
in about 45. And then what'd you do? Well, I dabbled

17:25.693 --> 17:28.917
around real estate for a couple years. and made 
some money. And then I went into the stock market

17:31.550 --> 17:33.652
here. By that time, I had me a pretty fair little 
bankroll, and I went into the, and I acquired me a

17:33.672 --> 17:48.188
pretty nice block of stocks on the stock market. 
Until a friend of mine came along, who was broke,

17:48.208 --> 17:56.997
and he was going to make me some money out of it. on an 
adventure that he had. And I didn't want to do it,

18:02.442 --> 18:05.406
but he finally got me down. I sold my stock and went 
into him and then lost that. I salvaged enough out

18:13.214 --> 18:22.765
of that deal to get another foothold

18:13.214 --> 18:22.765
and wound up with what I got. I see. And then you're 
retired now. Yeah, I haven't done anything for

18:26.794 --> 18:33.623
about 12, oh, about 15 years. I see. My health got 
pretty bad. That one stage,

18:35.986 --> 18:42.815
I don't know just what it was. I went to see quite a 
bunch of doctors, clinics.

18:51.186 --> 18:52.908
My neighbor came over here to see me. I was sitting 
around him. sitting there talking, but they came

18:54.655 --> 19:00.003
in here to visit with me. I see them now every once in 
a while, and they laugh at me. They said, yeah, ask

19:03.950 --> 19:14.266
me if I remember the time they came in here and 
talked to me, because they didn't think I was going

19:03.950 --> 19:14.266
to live till morning.

19:14.286 --> 19:15.387
Thank you, Mr. Rothy. You've given me a great deal 
of useful information. I certainly appreciate

19:19.474 --> 19:20.475
it. Well...
