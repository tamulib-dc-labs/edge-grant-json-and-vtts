WEBVTT

00:03.862 --> 00:05.364
This sort of set the groundwork. We became the 
official research agency for the Texas Highway

00:05.464 --> 00:08.828
Department. Most of our, well, all of our early 
funding was from the Texas Highway Department.

00:14.595 --> 00:18.981
That was our only source of funds.

00:19.001 --> 00:22.345
So this started in 1956 when I came. Now this was the 
same time that the, or shortly after I got here,

00:22.425 --> 00:32.417
later on that fall, they passed the federal 
National Congress passed the Highway Revenue Act

00:33.578 --> 00:46.175
of 1956, which was the creation of the interstate 
system, the national system of interstate and

00:33.578 --> 00:46.175
defense highways.

00:48.558 --> 01:02.337
As a part of that, they created what they called a 
research and planning, highway research and

00:48.558 --> 01:02.337
planning fund stream off of the special taxations 
that were set up to fund The interstate system.

01:05.991 --> 01:21.671
Now, the interstate system was funded from 
special taxes that were levied $0.05 a gallon

01:05.991 --> 01:21.671
against all gasoline, plus taxes on tires and 
lubricating oils and spare parts. This went into a

01:23.673 --> 01:28.219
trust fund held at the national level. Out of the 
trust fund, monies were apportioned on a formula

01:33.130 --> 01:35.553
basis to individual states. Now, 1.5% of each 
state's apportionment was eligible for

01:36.715 --> 01:47.990
expenditure on planning activities and 
research. Now, this really sort of created the

01:49.533 --> 01:57.163
research activities in highway transportation.

01:59.708 --> 02:09.502
However, that law said that if those funds were not 
spent on planning or research activities, they

01:59.708 --> 02:09.502
could revert to construction. And the state could 
go ahead and use them for construction. So 1.5% of

02:14.289 --> 02:23.862
the income stream to each state off the trust fund 
was a substantial amount of money.

02:27.908 --> 02:29.310
And it stimulated some. expansion in the research 
programs, particularly in areas of materials and

02:29.611 --> 02:44.429
what I'd call hard research, bridge work, piers, 
structural work. Then as the interstate began to

02:45.390 --> 02:53.239
actually go in to get into being in the late 50s, 
there became a growing awareness of the social and

02:55.143 --> 03:04.196
economic problems that were being created by it. 
One of the first early problem areas was the

03:06.479 --> 03:11.547
problem of bypassing small towns.

03:14.471 --> 03:24.205
There was a great concern that if the interstate 
system bypassed a small community, that that

03:14.471 --> 03:24.205
community would wither and die. since it was no 
longer now had the through traffic to support it.

03:29.481 --> 03:37.971
So that generated a series of studies on the 
economic consequences of bypasses, and that was

03:29.481 --> 03:37.971
some of the earlier work that we did. And our group 
then became a department head in TTI over the

03:38.992 --> 03:48.444
economics and planning department.

03:51.247 --> 03:53.770
And I believe we had four departments at that time. 
And

03:55.268 --> 03:59.693
that's not right. First, Bill Atkins, Dr. William 
G. Atkins, who is now retired from the system, was

04:01.535 --> 04:10.825
head of that group. And I worked under him. Then in 
the late 50s, he left. to go complete his PhD

04:24.884 --> 04:27.747
degree. And I became head of that group. And when he 
completed his PhD, he came back and worked for me

04:32.212 --> 04:36.196
then. We just sort of switched roles. But in 1964 
then, with the Revenue Act of 64, they changed what

04:39.941 --> 04:54.857
we call the HPR funding formula, the Highway 
Planning and Research Fund.

04:57.723 --> 05:16.069
Now the states that did not spend that 1.5% rather 
than having it available to revert to their

04:57.723 --> 05:16.069
construction program where most of them had been 
using it and very little of it going into planning

04:57.723 --> 05:16.069
and research activities, Texas was one of the few 
states that were using substantial amounts of it.

05:18.226 --> 05:20.750
I said, you either use it or lose it. If you don't use 
it for those activities, then it reverts back to

05:21.051 --> 05:27.382
the federal government and will become a part of 
the reapportionment process. They'll

05:27.422 --> 05:29.265
reapportion it to states that do need it. So that 
stimulated a substantial new activity in

05:30.387 --> 05:38.060
research and planning. And really, our program 
grew rather rapidly after 1964.

05:47.150 --> 05:56.562
In the meantime, I had been taking coursework 
toward a PhD, again in agricultural economics,

05:47.150 --> 05:56.562
again under Dr. McNeely. And I

05:57.964 --> 06:05.634
can't even remember when I finished it. I had to 
look at the bio data sheet. I want to say 1965. I

06:09.699 --> 06:12.803
don't think it's right. It must have been because 
you're only allowed 10 years to get it done. Oh, I

06:16.914 --> 06:19.778
broke all sorts of rules when I was doing it. I 
didn't have a formal program set up until after I'd

06:21.099 --> 06:28.749
been taking courses for a long time. Then I filed a 
degree plan. But I also ran into the problem that

06:31.532 --> 06:43.347
the university then had a regulation that anyone 
with a rank greater than assistant professor

06:31.532 --> 06:43.347
could not get a terminal degree here. Well, I got 
special dispensation because I had been hired

06:46.448 --> 06:58.023
with the proviso that I would be able to do it to 
complete the degree. So I'm one of the few people

06:58.984 --> 07:07.634
that ever received a degree from A&M carrying the 
rank of associate. And it was because I had been

07:12.520 --> 07:17.987
contracted to do that, or it was in our agreement 
that I would be able to complete a degree. Well, let

07:19.769 --> 07:20.730
me ask you this. You said that Texas was one of the 
states that put a lot of money into research on

07:21.311 --> 07:26.437
highways. Is it some of the states that have poorer 
transportation systems, did they fail to use this

07:28.179 --> 07:34.186
research? For instance, Louisiana and New 
Mexico, their road systems in those two states are

07:40.195 --> 07:43.679
not up to par with those in Texas for the most part. 
Were those two states not using that money for

07:43.719 --> 07:47.224
research? They were not. In fact, many states were 
not. Many states still don't use much of it for

07:49.987 --> 07:53.151
research. It can be used for research or planning. 
Now, in recent years, federal planning

07:56.876 --> 08:07.249
requirements have gotten ever increasingly 
stringent, so they've been required to do more and

07:56.876 --> 08:07.249
more planning activities. which have required a 
greater and greater percentage of the combined

08:07.938 --> 08:14.287
research and planning budgets. So many research 
budgets that you work on, this doesn't just apply

08:15.308 --> 08:22.357
to the interstate center, it applies to all the 
state highways. Oh, yeah, right. No, the funding

08:23.859 --> 08:26.964
is just out of that interstate funding stream. I 
get the impression from that that probably

08:27.344 --> 08:33.152
California was definitely using the money for 
research and planning. Texas were? What were some

08:34.467 --> 08:37.191
of the other states that were that you know of? Oh, 
Pennsylvania did, New York that had, and Indiana

08:37.211 --> 08:44.863
through Purdue. Most states, now California is an 
exception, but most states do not have an

08:46.325 --> 08:56.140
on-board, a major on-board research capability.

08:58.544 --> 09:02.650
So they do their research through their 
universities or consultants or some other way.

09:05.789 --> 09:11.037
California does have its own in-house research 
program. Now, Texas doesn't have much of one. We

09:13.281 --> 09:17.447
and the University of Texas do most of theirs. They 
do a little bit, but, oh, 10% of what we do. I thought

09:21.854 --> 09:25.700
this TTI was meeting that requirement that you 
said there. It is. Now, back in 19...

09:33.173 --> 09:55.435
late 50s and I'm not sure just what time we 
developed what we call the cooperative research

09:33.173 --> 09:55.435
program with the highway department that means 
and this is a unique

09:33.173 --> 09:55.435
arrangement among state departments and 
universities and that we're the only one that

09:33.173 --> 09:55.435
really has this sort of an arrangement the 
University of Texas then came into it in about

09:56.849 --> 09:59.291
1968. They also developed the same sort of 
agreement with the University of Texas. But this

10:05.296 --> 10:18.328
is a system whereby we jointly get together with 
the department and with their district engineers

10:05.296 --> 10:18.328
and determine what sorts of research needs to be 
done in the coming year. And in the spring of the

10:19.329 --> 10:25.354
year, we formulate a research program to begin in 
September in the beginning of the new fiscal year.

10:28.475 --> 10:48.575
And we have an agreement with the department that 
we will try to keep this in a sort of a constant mode

10:28.475 --> 10:48.575
in terms of total amount of money available for 
research so that we can plan for it and get the

10:28.475 --> 10:48.575
people and keep them and but that we will jointly 
determine through a series of area research

10:28.475 --> 10:48.575
committees. There are four of them in the 
department has that we work with those area

10:53.785 --> 11:05.400
committees in areas or areas of materials and 
pavements and structures and economics and

10:53.785 --> 11:05.400
planning. We work with those to develop the 
research program for the coming year. And we have a

11:10.046 --> 11:15.774
strong input into what sorts of research is going 
to be done. So we and the University of Texas, and

11:16.975 --> 11:23.083
they operate the same way now, do the research for 
the Texas Highway Department, for the State

11:24.430 --> 11:29.616
Department of Highways and Public 
Transportation in the state. Now, in addition, we

11:30.757 --> 11:43.932
do, of course, this year, for example, that'll be 
about $1.6 million that we will do in our

11:30.757 --> 11:43.932
cooperative research program with the Highway 
Department. But now, in addition, for the last 10

11:44.632 --> 11:49.678
or 15 years, We do direct contract work with the 
federal government, with other states, with

11:51.768 --> 12:03.346
other state agencies, with trade associations, 
and with private industry. So the co-op program,

12:04.048 --> 12:18.771
the program of the highway department, which 
originally was our total program, now this year

12:04.048 --> 12:18.771
we'll have about, the year we're in now, about $7.2 
million worth of research, of which the states

12:19.561 --> 12:26.812
will be about in our cooperative about 1.6. So it's 
a very, very important part of our research

12:27.233 --> 12:42.195
activity, in that it is the one program which we 
have, which allows us continuity. But in terms of

12:43.357 --> 12:45.180
total it's only about less than 25% of our program. 
About how many researchers do you have employed at

12:52.465 --> 12:55.229
TTI? Are the faculty members working half-time or 
what? We have both. We have a total of, gosh, the

13:02.500 --> 13:09.330
numbers again get me. We have a total of about 125.

13:15.080 --> 13:19.184
FTEs, full-time equivalent, professionals. 
Now, we have 327

13:19.965 --> 13:29.015
people, but now that includes all of our 
technicians, our clerical, secretarial. We have

13:29.776 --> 13:32.279
a large technical group at the research annex. All 
the students and graduate students that we use in

13:33.800 --> 13:37.584
the research program. So the total body count is 
going to be well over 300. But in terms of

13:41.573 --> 13:44.998
professional full-time equivalents, we have 
about 125, 127. Where are all of the facilities

13:45.018 --> 13:51.968
used in the research, where are they located? OK. 
On campus, right in this complex primarily. Here,

13:59.480 --> 14:02.725
back in the asphalt lab, the concrete labs. Those 
are campus activities. They're concentrated

14:04.768 --> 14:05.989
here. Now, we've got people scattered in other 
places. But here on campus, out at the research

14:10.396 --> 14:17.386
annex, we have our safety division headquartered 
there. In the Hirschfield properties in Austin,

14:18.768 --> 14:25.437
we have our accident analysis division 
headquartered there. What properties is that?

14:28.081 --> 14:39.998
This is the Joe Moore, the Hirschfield estate that 
Joe Moore from the A&M Development Foundation

14:28.081 --> 14:39.998
bought and remodeled, spent about a million 
dollars remodeling the thing. How do you spell

14:40.467 --> 14:42.971
that, Hirschfield? H-I-R-S-C-H-F-I-E-L-D.

14:42.991 --> 15:00.116
And

14:42.991 --> 15:00.116
he wanted someone from A&M to be in the properties, 
and so we had been in commercial lease space in

14:42.991 --> 15:00.116
Austin. And so we moved in January from that space 
over to the Hirschfield properties because he

15:01.077 --> 15:09.630
wanted someone there, and it's very nice and very 
convenient. But we have an office in Austin. We

15:12.035 --> 15:12.977
have one in Dallas. We have one in Houston, one in 
San Antonio, one in Arkansas,

15:13.638 --> 15:32.588
plus the campus and out at the research annex. Now, 
you were asking about joint employees. I've got

15:37.488 --> 15:40.211
120 some odd. The last count I had, we had 37 of those 
people were jointly employed with academic

15:40.751 --> 15:51.643
communities, academic departments, primarily 
with the civil engineering department. That's

15:51.663 --> 15:53.285
our largest single one. But we have people with the 
joint employees with the Department of

15:53.805 --> 16:07.039
Economics, the Sociology, Institute of 
Statistics, of course, practically all of the

16:07.829 --> 16:19.000
engineering departments, chemical 
engineering, industrial, mechanical,

16:07.829 --> 16:19.000
geology.

16:20.381 --> 16:22.443
But we have a number of joint. And that's really one 
of the functions of the Institute is to be able to

16:22.684 --> 16:36.317
provide the mechanism where we can, if we need 
expertise that's in an academic department,

16:22.684 --> 16:36.317
there's a mechanism of how we can bring them aboard 
and let them participate in the research

16:22.684 --> 16:36.317
programs.

16:39.571 --> 16:44.435
Do you consider the level of funding that the 
agency receives by the state to be adequate?

16:44.455 --> 16:46.537
Nobody ever gets adequate funding from the state. 
We do not get a great deal of state general revenue

16:46.838 --> 16:57.047
funds, and traditionally have not. Of our budget 
this year, only less than 10% of our budget will be

16:58.929 --> 17:06.996
state general revenue funds. And the other 90% is 
soft money. That is money that we acquire through

17:11.820 --> 17:14.262
contracts. Now, that is not enough to sustain an 
operation over time.

17:24.673 --> 17:30.760
That's one of the objectives going through our 
target 2000 and our five-year planning process.

17:30.840 --> 17:36.966
One of our objectives is to increase the 
proportion of state general revenue funds

17:37.537 --> 17:42.341
available to the Institute to the 20 to 25% range. 
So that and for a number of reasons, not just in

17:43.622 --> 18:05.822
order to have the money available, but one of the 
things that a research organization should do is

17:43.622 --> 18:05.822
to identify emerging problem areas before those 
problems become critical to look at problems that

18:06.292 --> 18:11.838
are not the domain of any one funding agency. Lots 
of problems never get addressed because no one has

18:14.180 --> 18:20.227
direct responsibility for that problem area. So 
we need, we feel, to have state general revenue

18:21.548 --> 18:34.662
funds sufficient to enable us to, one, bring in 
people with expertise in areas that we do not now

18:35.114 --> 18:47.411
have funded research projects to support them on, 
and let them develop research in those areas, the

18:35.114 --> 18:47.411
seed money concept. Secondly, to allow us to 
conduct a modest amount of research

18:47.431 --> 19:03.973
in those areas where no one is now responsible for 
that problem, so that problem does not get

18:47.431 --> 19:03.973
addressed, the intermodal problems for example 
no one either at the federal level or at the state

19:04.780 --> 19:29.556
level is responsible for the interact 
interactions between let's say railroads and

19:04.780 --> 19:29.556
trucking or airports and good movements the truck 
and rail industry supply and airports the

19:04.780 --> 19:29.556
interactions of those or the problems of

19:31.477 --> 19:35.121
piggyback operations, truck rail operations. So 
there's lots of problem areas that do not get

19:36.222 --> 19:48.436
addressed because in the governmental 
frameworks that divide the responsibilities,

19:36.222 --> 19:48.436
they fall through the cracks. So there needs to be 
resources available to allow you to do those, to do

19:48.997 --> 20:00.910
policy studies, which no one really has 
responsibility for, to answer questions that no

20:02.105 --> 20:05.875
one really has the prerogative to ask in a modal 
agency. For example, what should be the state's

20:07.199 --> 20:14.318
role or the state's posture toward 
transportation development? No one at the state

20:15.581 --> 20:17.346
has the prerogative to fund research to answer 
that question. Since the state does not have a role

20:22.760 --> 20:36.641
in transportation, it has a highway system with 
its own requirements, an aeronautics commission

20:22.760 --> 20:36.641
with its purviews over air, a Texas Railroad 
Commission. It has a water system that nobody

20:37.963 --> 20:47.637
really has any responsibilities for, and a 
pipeline system that has nobody to ask questions

20:37.963 --> 20:47.637
about it. But the state does not have a mechanism by 
which it can look at what should be the

20:48.292 --> 20:55.462
transportation balance. Where should we be 
trying to influence transportation growth,

20:55.542 --> 21:04.695
transportation development area? What should 
the state's posture be with regard to conflicts

21:04.715 --> 21:11.485
between modes of transportation? The pipeline 
railroad conflict on cold slurry pipelines, for

21:11.505 --> 21:16.392
example. So, you know, somebody needs to be in a 
position to look at some of those problems. What

21:23.643 --> 21:26.167
has TTI done to promote highway safety?

21:28.972 --> 21:33.961
Highway safety has been one of the large things 
that we've been operating and working on. And

21:35.824 --> 21:40.472
you're always... subject to omission when you 
start listing the things that you've done in the

21:42.157 --> 21:51.248
past, but there are some very visible things that 
we have done. We developed

21:51.308 --> 22:05.825
very early what we called the forgiving roadway 
concept.

22:05.845 --> 22:10.510
Now this is sort of analogous to the old military 
expression that if it moves, salute it. If it

22:18.014 --> 22:19.436
doesn't move, pick it up. If you can't pick it up, 
paint it. Well, we took that sort of an attitude

22:22.581 --> 22:30.894
toward highway roadways, and we said if it doesn't 
need to be there, move it. Clear the roadway to the

22:31.475 --> 22:35.121
extent you can. If you can't clear it, then protect 
it. If you can't protect it, then make it break

22:40.882 --> 22:43.727
away. So with that, we started out and we were the 
ones that developed the breakaway signs.

22:54.087 --> 23:03.565
All of the large, and this primarily was developed 
for interstate systems, where they had the big,

22:54.087 --> 23:03.565
massive sign boards because of high speed. and the 
massive sign frame that those things had to

23:04.203 --> 23:07.647
support. Well, you had the big H beams that were the 
supports. Well, these were lethal. If you ran off

23:11.452 --> 23:18.962
the road and hit one of those, it was bad news all the 
way around. So one of the early research

23:18.982 --> 23:31.037
activities we had in the late 60s, I believe about 
68, was the development of a breakaway concept to

23:18.982 --> 23:31.037
make those signs break away. Now, the last 
estimate that I saw was, I don't remember the

23:31.979 --> 23:42.708
numbers, but up in literally the tens of thousands 
of lives that have been saved by making those signs

23:31.979 --> 23:42.708
break away. Multi-billions of dollars of value in 
terms of property loss and loss of life saved

23:44.289 --> 23:53.257
through those systems. From that, we went to the 
breakaway of the luminary supports, light poles,

23:54.458 --> 24:01.564
and that was a major... uh, safety breakthrough. 
And then, uh, that took care of the part of those

24:04.322 --> 24:11.930
things that you had to leave there and you could do 
something about to make them less dangerous. And

24:13.031 --> 24:29.627
then we developed a, uh, what is now known as the 
Texas crash cushion, the impact attenuation

24:13.031 --> 24:29.627
systems, the barrel systems, uh, for those areas 
like, uh, parapets, bridge radio, uh, bridge

24:13.031 --> 24:29.627
piers, Gore areas that have

24:30.198 --> 24:48.762
concrete walls that if you want to turn off on an 
exit ramp, for example, and you don't make your

24:30.198 --> 24:48.762
decision quick enough and try to turn and don't 
make it, you hit the wall. And one place on 59 in

24:48.782 --> 24:57.673
Houston, they had like 13 deaths in just a matter of 
months of people hitting a parapet wall. So we

24:58.548 --> 25:05.796
developed the crash cushions, and those are now in 
use nationwide. Dr. Hirsch and Dr. Ivey and Dr.

25:07.218 --> 25:26.479
Olson

25:07.218 --> 25:26.479
were all instrumental in developing both the 
breakaway signs, breakaway light poles, and the

25:27.033 --> 25:29.676
and the crash cushions. Now, that's one concept, 
or that's one area of the safety, in the hardware

25:29.696 --> 25:35.983
area. We have ongoing programs in developing 
bridge ratings. We also developed the Texas

25:41.449 --> 25:45.633
twist, for example, on guardrails. One of the big 
problems in roadside safety was you put up a

25:45.653 --> 25:56.145
guardrail, and sometimes the guardrail becomes 
more dangerous than what you were trying to

25:45.653 --> 25:56.145
protect them from. and if you were to go off the 
road, particularly in the old guardrail system

25:57.104 --> 26:03.294
where you just stubbed out the end and it sat there. 
And you've probably seen the gory pictures where

26:03.314 --> 26:10.045
somebody hit that head on and the guardrail comes 
through the car and through the occupant and out

26:03.314 --> 26:10.045
the back end. So we developed a safe end treatment 
for guardrails.

26:18.147 --> 26:19.870
Again, that's on the hardware system. One of the 
big problems that we've addressed and now have a

26:19.930 --> 26:30.386
solution to is the problem of restraining heavy 
vehicles on bridges and overpasses. You may

26:30.406 --> 26:39.801
recall a couple of years ago the big ammonia truck 
accident in Houston where the ammonia truck was

26:30.406 --> 26:39.801
coming around over one of the overpasses and ran 
through the guardrail, went down two levels

26:40.726 --> 26:53.259
below, and it hit and ruptured and killed either 
eight or ten people and injured like 110. They

26:53.820 --> 26:55.842
closed the interchanges up. So this focused 
attention on the need to develop a system, a

26:56.282 --> 27:07.594
guardrail system or a bridge rating system that 
could be used in especially sensitive areas like

26:56.282 --> 27:07.594
that. to restrain those heavy vehicles. They had 
the Martinez, California school bus incident

27:11.784 --> 27:29.185
when 27 school children were killed because a bus 
went through a guardrail again on an overpass and

27:11.784 --> 27:29.185
went down several 20, 30 feet and killed a whole 
bunch of kids. So those are what I would call safety

27:30.627 --> 27:36.214
hardware sort of things. the national leaders in 
the development of those for the last 15, 20 years.

27:44.295 --> 28:04.395
At the same time, we've been doing some very good 
work in hydroplaning and trying to assure that the

27:44.295 --> 28:04.395
vehicle-roadway interaction is, it's not a good 
term, but to assure that we're building, using the

27:44.295 --> 28:04.395
right materials to to provide skid resistance 
that's necessary to keep the vehicle on the

28:05.101 --> 28:10.647
roadway. So we've done hydroplaning work. We've 
developed new materials for lightweight

28:15.311 --> 28:26.703
aggregate or surface treatments to give you high 
coefficient of friction so that you can retain the

28:15.311 --> 28:26.703
control of the car. This is all a wet weather 
problem, by the way. You don't have the problem in

28:28.885 --> 28:31.588
dry weather. It's when you get rain. You get a 
buildup of water. Now, this buildup is just a film.

28:36.947 --> 28:38.149
It can be just a film. But if you have, under the 
worst conditions, a very slick pavement, that is a

28:38.209 --> 28:58.495
very smooth pavement, and smooth tires, and low 
tire pressure, and high speed, you can hydroplane

28:38.209 --> 28:58.495
or get riding up on that film of water and totally 
lose contact between the tire and the pavement. So

28:58.515 --> 29:01.099
you try to turn the wheel, and nothing happens. Or 
you may go into just a total spin. So we've been

29:04.298 --> 29:19.960
developing materials and roadway systems to 
minimize hydroplaning, to minimize the adverse

29:04.298 --> 29:19.960
effects of wet weather.

29:19.981 --> 29:22.644
Do you conduct your highway crash tests here? Add 
it to Research Annex.

29:30.776 --> 29:31.417
Let me ask you this. Do you know how Texas ranks the 
other states?

29:44.005 --> 29:44.986
No, I really don't. I'm sure those... We had one 
place where Nevada, I believe, had the highest

29:45.006 --> 29:51.012
fatality rate on its highways. Maybe it was 
Wyoming, one of the western states. Yeah, it was

29:54.516 --> 29:57.019
one of the western states, and I sort of believe it 
was Wyoming. I believe it was. They also have the

29:58.440 --> 30:04.026
lowest compliance rate with the 55-mile-an-hour 
speed limit, I think. But they've got some special

30:04.046 --> 30:05.828
problems. They've got ice problems and all of that 
to deal with. I'm sure those numbers, those

30:09.472 --> 30:13.776
rankings are available in terms of... Vehicle 
miles traveled, deaths per vehicle miles

30:14.060 --> 30:17.924
traveled by state. But I really don't know just how 
we rank. I would say that Texas, or I would think

30:23.830 --> 30:29.636
that Texas would rank fairly good. Now, we are not a 
state that believes in low speeds. Our compliance

30:41.093 --> 30:48.261
with the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit is not as bad 
as Wyoming's, but we're not in compliance either.

30:48.382 --> 30:55.049
Our people don't drive 55 miles an hour, as you well 
know if you're out on Interstate 45 somewhere. If

30:55.089 --> 30:57.993
you drive 55, everybody's passing you. But it is 
better than it was.

31:04.160 --> 31:10.948
And in the areas where speed is a critical safety 
problem, I think we're doing better than we are in

31:11.637 --> 31:17.384
areas where it's not, like on the interstate 
system. Speed is not really that big a safety

31:17.404 --> 31:23.652
problem on the interstate, because it was 
designed for it. Where speed's a real problem is on

31:23.673 --> 31:34.066
the foreign market roads in the rural system, 
where it was designed, you know, 40-mile turns,

31:23.673 --> 31:34.066
and you'd go 45, and you'd be in a ditch. That's 
where we're really speed-sensitive in terms of

31:35.928 --> 31:41.155
accident rates. Do you have any idea on how the 
state police are enforcing the 55 mile per hour

31:41.607 --> 31:47.276
speed? Writing tickets just fast as they can. 
Again,

31:49.720 --> 32:09.370
the numbers are not, I won't swear to the numbers, 
but if I recall correctly, their numbers

31:49.720 --> 32:09.370
of tickets issued last year was like 1,800,000 
tickets. they have increased in each of the last

32:10.548 --> 32:21.642
several years like 25% or 30% each year in the 
number of tickets they have issued. Are most of

32:21.662 --> 32:28.050
these tickets being issued on interstate or on the 
farm and market roads or on just regular state

32:21.662 --> 32:28.050
highways? I would guess that most, well, I don't 
know for sure, but I would say that a good portion of

32:28.070 --> 32:39.525
them are on the interstate and on the major U.S. 
highways, which carry most of the traffic.

32:40.771 --> 32:47.321
they're going to concentrate their activities on 
those areas where they've got most of the

32:40.771 --> 32:47.321
vehicles.

32:50.185 --> 32:58.859
In view of the large size of the state of Texas, how 
does it happen to have one of the better highway

32:50.185 --> 32:58.859
systems in the nation?

32:58.879 --> 33:01.202
Several reasons.

33:02.384 --> 33:09.495
One, it has always had a very well-managed, and 
very

33:10.370 --> 33:17.258
honest highway department. Now this has not been 
true in many of the other states. It's had a highway

33:22.584 --> 33:32.456
department, or state department of highways and 
public transportation now, which has been free of

33:22.584 --> 33:32.456
scandal since the Mall Ferguson days. That was the 
last period in which there was a political

33:38.956 --> 33:40.478
influence in the Highway Department. It has 
been... That was in what year approximately?

33:45.123 --> 33:45.703
Mid-20s? Yeah, the Maul Paul Ferguson 
governorship era where there was some highway

33:46.484 --> 34:00.059
scandals back in those areas, but the Highway 
Department has been relatively free of political

33:46.484 --> 34:00.059
influence. It has been a very well managed, very 
professionally operated department, which

34:00.079 --> 34:08.288
means that with the money available they put it to 
good use. How do you think the political influence

34:11.408 --> 34:16.115
was less in Texas than it was in other states? Why 
was this? I really don't know. As I say, during the

34:19.681 --> 34:24.148
Ma Ferguson era, we had it here. Gosh, they've got 
it in all other states now, or not all other states.

34:29.276 --> 34:31.339
They've got it in several other states now. bid 
rigging, kickback, Spiro Agnew. What are some of

34:34.623 --> 34:36.345
the states where this occurs? Oh, Maryland was 
one. Spiro Agnew was up to his ears in it. In fact,

34:42.411 --> 34:50.060
didn't he get sent to jail over the kickbacks? I 
think he did. For not reporting the income, I

34:51.181 --> 34:54.705
believe. I believe it was from actually taking the 
kickback. It was from not reporting it.

34:57.548 --> 34:59.250
Pennsylvania's got it right now. or have had it, 
they're just now cleaning theirs up.

35:04.327 --> 35:07.432
Massachusetts, Tennessee has had it up to their 
ears. Many states, for example, Texas, being

35:09.134 --> 35:16.325
apolitical, has had a very stable highway 
department. Take Pennsylvania, for example,

35:16.345 --> 35:21.112
before the current commissioner, who's a good 
friend of mine, Tom Larson, took over. They turned

35:21.152 --> 35:28.883
over their whole personnel every time they 
changed, and they were in a bipartisan, area, so

35:29.487 --> 35:34.014
when the Democrats got in, they wiped out the whole 
department. They were under civil service

35:34.034 --> 35:34.855
agreements. No, no. And they started all over 
again, so it became a part of the patronage

35:36.377 --> 35:45.631
process, the highway department jobs, and it's 
reflected. Now, in addition to good management

35:46.492 --> 35:57.629
and lack of political influence on the 
department, these are my opinions, of course, and

35:46.492 --> 35:57.629
good leadership, but C. Greer and the highway... 
He's still on the highway, Gordon. No, he just

35:58.360 --> 36:04.430
stepped down a matter of months ago. But

36:04.450 --> 36:19.334
Mr. Luther Deberry, who's the one that just has 
been stepped down about a year ago, and Mark Good

36:04.450 --> 36:19.334
now has it, but they've all been high-quality 
professional people. Now, in addition, I've got

36:20.396 --> 36:24.182
to put in a plug for the continuing long-term 
research programs that they have funded. Texas

36:28.258 --> 36:38.153
has been a leader in the development of new 
materials, of new design, of new traffic systems.

36:38.613 --> 36:45.804
They have not only funded the research, but 
through this integration of the research with the

36:38.613 --> 36:45.804
department, they've used it.

36:48.828 --> 36:50.170
That and...

36:53.069 --> 37:03.679
A large area of the state is very favorably 
situated from the standpoint of soil and climate

36:53.069 --> 37:03.679
for rope building. Now, a lot of it is very 
miserably suited, too, but a bigger section of it

37:04.199 --> 37:10.585
is good than is bad. The bad part is around the Gulf 
Coast. Gulf Coast, Beaumont area, and we're in a

37:12.827 --> 37:19.293
bad area here with the Taylor Marl. It's a heaving 
soil problem. that runs all the way up Corsicana,

37:22.398 --> 37:26.483
that area. What was that? Taylor what? Marl, 
M-A-R-L. It's a soil type. Very fine-grained

37:32.931 --> 37:45.687
clays that absorb water and expand when they're 
wet massively, and then when they dry, they

37:32.931 --> 37:45.687
contract massively, and it's a heaving soil 
problem. Very difficult. My house, I can't close a

37:47.189 --> 37:49.231
door in it. I keep cleaning off the doors because 
the soil keeps expanding and contracting. So this

37:57.139 --> 37:58.261
is a bad area. But you get out in West Texas, and 
that's great road building country.

38:05.833 --> 38:11.522
That and the fact that, well, I guess those are the 
major things that I would say. In closing, could

38:11.903 --> 38:13.245
you tell me, A little bit more about the research 
projects that have recently been completed, some

38:13.613 --> 38:21.721
that you may not have touched on, or some that are 
underway now that are significant. Let me run

38:23.163 --> 38:34.494
through probably two or three different things 
that I think that we have underway that are

38:23.163 --> 38:34.494
currently answering real problems. One of the 
things that greatly concerns everyone in the

38:34.594 --> 38:43.603
highway industry is the tremendous

38:44.984 --> 38:52.812
Susceptibility of the road building industry to 
the oil problem, particularly the concerns over

38:44.984 --> 38:52.812
foreign oil. Asphalt, which is the major binder 
for use in roadway building, is of course a

38:53.493 --> 39:02.202
derivative of petroleum. It comes from crude oil 
and is the residual from the refining process, or

39:02.502 --> 39:10.030
one of the residuals. As in a period of real oil 
shortage, the refining process will squeeze that

39:11.208 --> 39:23.568
residual even down, so it'll shorten the amount of 
asphalt available. Even greater, perhaps, than

39:24.970 --> 39:34.465
the amount of gasoline that's produced, because 
they can make refining changes that will reduce

39:24.970 --> 39:34.465
the percentage of asphalt out of a given barrel of 
oil. not into gasoline, but into home heating oils

39:37.094 --> 39:43.141
and other things like that that use the heavy end as 
well. Asphalt prices have gone from, say,

39:45.123 --> 39:56.975
pre-'74, they were less than $20 a ton, to around 
$200 a ton now. So they have become very expensive.

40:00.479 --> 40:05.785
So it is very important that we try to develop

40:07.756 --> 40:12.542
substitutes for asphalt, which we're working on 
now. One of the most abundant elements, and

40:13.843 --> 40:35.890
particularly as we go into the EPA

40:13.843 --> 40:35.890
requirements to reduce pollution and continue to 
develop sour crude and sour gas areas, is the

40:13.843 --> 40:35.890
production of abatement sulfur.

40:36.460 --> 40:50.598
We have research projects underway to attempt to 
utilize sulfur as either a partial replacement

40:36.460 --> 40:50.598
for asphalt as a binder or a total replacement. Now 
these are two different concepts. The partial

40:52.440 --> 40:58.628
replacement is what we,

40:52.440 --> 40:58.628
and there are two different processes. The Shell 
Canada process and a French process which they

40:58.688 --> 41:04.375
call the d'Aquitaine process. process. I wish I 
could. It's an individual's

41:09.078 --> 41:23.695
name, and I think it's D-A-C-Q-U-A-T-A-I-N,

41:09.078 --> 41:23.695
the Aquitaine process. Anyway, these two 
processes are ways of

41:24.476 --> 41:30.784
homogenizing liquid asphalt heated and liquid 
heated sulfur to extend through substituting

41:31.338 --> 41:46.378
sulfur for asphalt to provide a binder up to, say, 
30% or 40% of the asphalt can be substituted with

41:31.338 --> 41:46.378
sulfur. And it actually provides perhaps a 
better. We haven't finished the evaluations over

41:49.943 --> 41:52.487
time yet. But it looks very, very promising to 
where you can replace with another material some

41:53.268 --> 42:00.838
of this asphalt. Now the other process, and we're 
entering into the second contract now to evaluate

42:01.679 --> 42:10.291
its effectiveness, is what we call plasticized 
sulfur. And that's just taking sulfur, molten

42:11.213 --> 42:27.195
liquid sulfur, and adding plasticizers to it to 
change its character so that you can make a

42:11.213 --> 42:27.195
flexible pavement binder of it. And that looks 
very promising. The problem being right now, not

42:30.772 --> 42:40.386
with the sulfur, but with the cost of the 
plasticizers that you have to add to it to make it

42:30.772 --> 42:40.386
act like a flexible binder. But these are areas 
where we're trying to develop new materials to

42:41.308 --> 42:56.070
replace things that we know are going to get 
increasingly scarce, increasingly expensive,

42:41.308 --> 42:56.070
and increasingly sensitive to other market 
activities where we, you know, we may hit a time

42:56.523 --> 43:06.615
when for periods of time there just won't be any 
asphalt or will be only a half enough to do the road

42:56.523 --> 43:06.615
building. So we've got to do something. Where is 
Texas getting most of its asphalt now? Of course,

43:12.202 --> 43:16.607
we're getting it from the refineries in Texas 
here. There are a number of major asphalt

43:18.790 --> 43:23.155
producers, major refineries that They produce it 
as a normal part of the refining process. But that

43:29.338 --> 43:33.562
one is in the materials area. Another very 
important area, and one that gets overlooked a

43:33.663 --> 43:40.150
lot, is we have quit building highways. Now, we 
haven't really quit. But we're not adding

43:42.933 --> 43:52.804
freeways or expressways in Houston, for example, 
nearly at the rate at which we're adding vehicles

43:53.459 --> 43:56.783
and vehicle miles of travel. So as a little 
over-exaggeration, we have quit several years

43:58.185 --> 44:05.054
ago building facilities. Now we're going in and 
trying to repair and update and modify existing

44:05.935 --> 44:11.221
facilities. Many of those have hit their life 
expectancy, and they've got to be redone. So we're

44:16.368 --> 44:22.015
putting our money in that, in the maintenance and 
rehabilitation of our existing plant, rather

44:16.368 --> 44:22.015
than adding to the plant. At the same time, the 
demand placed on those facilities is increasing

44:22.805 --> 44:29.552
each year. For example, Houston, the last time I 
looked, was adding a net to their vehicle fleet,

44:30.513 --> 44:42.765
this is Harris County, of 400 vehicles a day. Every 
day, 400 more vehicles than there was the day

44:45.007 --> 44:51.934
before to accommodate on that set amount of 
facility. Well, the problem is you've got all of

44:53.129 --> 44:58.814
the growing demand. You don't have any increased 
supply. So how do you make what you have there work

45:01.256 --> 45:14.368
more efficiently and more effectively to stretch 
the supply, as it were, or to accommodate a part of

45:01.256 --> 45:14.368
the increased demand? It's a losing game, but it's 
a fighting of a delaying action until you can come

45:15.970 --> 45:21.735
up with a better solution. So our research has been 
geared very strongly, particularly in areas like

45:23.099 --> 45:34.630
Houston and Dallas, to how do you modify existing 
facilities to squeeze more capacity out of them?

45:35.531 --> 45:44.139
How do you accommodate other people movement as 
opposed to vehicle movement on existing

45:35.531 --> 45:44.139
facilities? And we're doing some of that through 
our big van pooling program, our occupancy

45:45.040 --> 45:52.667
vehicle lane, program on new freeways. We've got 
one of those coming in on Gulf Freeway in Houston,

45:54.916 --> 45:58.180
for example. The contra flow lane that we've got on 
I-45 coming out now. Have you been through that?

46:08.411 --> 46:14.157
It's on I-45 coming out of downtown Houston up 
toward Conroe. In the morning, in the morning, we

46:14.177 --> 46:19.903
take one of the outbound lanes, the one coming 
north, and convert it into an inbound lane. And

46:28.271 --> 46:47.393
then in the afternoon, we switch over on the other 
side of the median, add

46:28.271 --> 46:47.393
one of the inbound lanes now going south over to the 
outbound lane coming north, and use that for buses

46:28.271 --> 46:47.393
and van pools and high occupancy vehicles. We're 
getting more capacity out of the system by doing

46:48.503 --> 46:51.527
that. It's expensive in that it costs you. You've 
got to go down and set it up every morning and take it

46:54.170 --> 47:01.821
down every morning and then set it up and take it 
down every afternoon. But so far it's been safe and

47:02.401 --> 47:07.508
has increased the capacity of those systems.

47:10.289 --> 47:15.758
So those are some of the types of things that we 
think are critical to us. We're going to have to

47:15.798 --> 47:18.923
make a better use of what we have now. At the same 
time, we have got to come up with new solutions to

47:19.704 --> 47:32.044
the problems that we've been facing for 30 years 
that have grown more and more acute and yet have

47:19.704 --> 47:32.044
never been solved. And we have plenty of problems 
to work on for the rest of my lifetime in

47:32.395 --> 47:37.354
transportation. Thank you, Dr. Wood, for taking 
the time to talk with me. You've been most helpful.

47:42.614 --> 47:44.059
I appreciate it and enjoyed it.
