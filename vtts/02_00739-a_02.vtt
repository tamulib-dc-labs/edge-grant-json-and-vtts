WEBVTT

00:05.954 --> 00:09.999
What was it that you did for entertainment and 
recreation? Well, most of our recreation and

00:11.460 --> 00:21.512
entertainment was self-made out there on the 
drill ground around where we'd play ball, you

00:11.460 --> 00:21.512
know. And each company would have a team, you know, 
we'd go out there and we'd play. And actually, DX

00:29.521 --> 00:32.685
Bible got some of his football players off of 
those. He'd go out there watching. And I know old

00:35.587 --> 00:38.451
Harry Pinson, he's a past mate of mine. He was just 
out there playing from D Company and old D actually

00:39.112 --> 00:49.285
watched him and he asked Harry to come down and suit 
up and he made a good football player down there.

00:49.305 --> 00:53.651
I'd say just company games and things like that. 
Now we had to go to Garner Hall on Sunday mornings to

00:54.793 --> 00:58.638
the chapel. They cut that out sometime later but 
except when we were seniors we could We didn't have

01:06.316 --> 01:14.285
to go when we were seniors, but some of us would 
because they had real good speakers in those days.

01:15.446 --> 01:25.978
And of course, some of the boys would take, would 
put under the shirt some kind of magazine and be

01:15.446 --> 01:25.978
reading during the speech, stuff like that. But we 
had to go. Had to go to the chapel every Sunday

01:28.682 --> 01:31.605
morning. And they'd have, I remember the 
Knickerbockers from Dallas, They were great

01:36.539 --> 01:50.437
preachers, and one of the boys was

01:36.539 --> 01:50.437
quarterback on one of the excellent football 
teams here, Arthur Knickerbocker. Well, those

01:51.298 --> 02:01.591
Knickerbockers, every year, one or two of them 
would come down and give a talk there, and then

01:51.298 --> 02:01.591
different ones, but they were excellent 
speakers, and I enjoyed it very much. And Dr. Zell

02:01.611 --> 02:04.234
also, We didn't have any churches around here 
then.

02:09.484 --> 02:11.126
Had a YMCA. But Dr. Bezell held a class, a Bible 
class, every Sunday morning for seniors if they

02:11.147 --> 02:18.476
wanted to come. Didn't have to. And then finally 
they got some guys like Mr. Cofer, who learned

02:21.560 --> 02:31.032
English, And they would hold a Sunsuit class in 
these different buildings around like over there

02:31.754 --> 02:39.661
in the EE building and places where they have 
chapel. And that's about, that's the way, that's

02:40.522 --> 02:47.589
about our religious, went on that way until about 
1920. And then some of the churches started

02:47.609 --> 02:53.174
bringing preachers down here. I know Reverend 
Brown came here in 1920. He died here a few years ago

02:56.317 --> 02:59.280
and he was the first pastor of the Baptist Church 
here on the campus. And then the Methodists and

03:03.729 --> 03:17.490
others get started until they finally build quite 
a group of churches here on campus, I think, enough

03:03.729 --> 03:17.490
to satisfy all the needs.

03:17.651 --> 03:26.905
Did you ever have visiting lecturers from off 
campus come out, come in for afternoon or evening

03:17.651 --> 03:26.905
lectures like today Of course there's something 
going on several times a week of that nature. Yeah.

03:31.661 --> 03:32.882
We didn't have much of that. Most of our speakers 
were on Sunday morning chapel services and we'd

03:35.305 --> 03:55.508
have our classes, our subject matter classes 
would sometimes bring in outside speakers to give

03:35.305 --> 03:55.508
a lecture.

03:56.787 --> 04:03.015
Now, you asked what we did off the hours. On Sunday 
was a long day, mostly, and a room they and I, we were

04:03.035 --> 04:10.064
both, we roomed together here three years. And 
we'd go around to the different barns. We were

04:14.190 --> 04:15.852
taking animal science. And we had an iceberg named 
Garrigan charge the horses. He was from Ireland,

04:21.619 --> 04:22.641
too. That barn out there named Garrigan Stables 
had horses. And we'd visit with Mr. Garrigan and

04:27.078 --> 04:30.943
then this fellow named Sam's. He was a Scotchman. 
He had charge of cattle. And we'd visit with all

04:34.649 --> 04:42.840
these barns around and went way out to F&B station 
where they had a lot of feedlots out there then

04:34.649 --> 04:42.840
feeding cattle. And we'd go out there and look over 
the cattle and stuff like that. Of course that is

04:48.328 --> 04:54.857
natural for us to do that because we were raised 
that way. with one horses and cattle and stuff like

04:55.158 --> 05:09.531
that, and sheep, but there

04:55.158 --> 05:09.531
wasn't much else to do unless you sat on the bench 
under these trees and have a bull session, you see.

05:09.551 --> 05:10.712
A lot of that going on.

05:13.775 --> 05:23.764
I know we had an old boy named Strange, they called 
him Tanlake because in our English, in our senior

05:13.775 --> 05:23.764
English class up there in public speaking, This 
teacher would let you pick any subject you wanted

05:25.111 --> 05:29.858
to. An old train picked a subject called Tandilac, 
that tonic, Tandilac tonic, you know. And he gave

05:38.169 --> 05:45.699
it in the form of, like these, you see these 
advertisements. And about you couldn't sleep,

05:45.719 --> 05:49.024
you was nervous, and all that stuff. And he'd say, 
I've taken one bottle of Tandilac, anybody can

05:49.905 --> 05:54.291
sleep with you, and all that stuff. He made a good 
one and so they called him Tanak for the rest

05:54.524 --> 06:03.177
of it. So with not much to do you have to think up 
things like that. We were pretty well happy

06:09.747 --> 06:19.562
because the world itself was slower in those days 
than it is now. Communications and everything

06:20.584 --> 06:23.468
else was slower and the world was bigger. It's 
getting to be a small world now. So we, I guess we

06:28.323 --> 06:33.710
were, whatever we did was kind of in line with the 
period we were in. Many people make any use of the

06:34.291 --> 06:39.177
library for... Well, we didn't have much of a 
library in those days. That was one of our

06:39.237 --> 06:44.244
omissions down here. In fact, when I was a fish, the 
library was in one corner of the academic

06:45.686 --> 06:52.094
building. The library before that burned. And so 
we didn't have much of a library and each

06:53.975 --> 07:14.616
department tried to have its own in addition to 
that, you know, of the certain of the journals and

06:53.975 --> 07:14.616
things that were necessary to really carry on the 
scholarship program. And then the

07:14.636 --> 07:21.383
Experimentation Library had a library, the 
Extension Service had one, but Yes, on Sunday

07:23.303 --> 07:31.495
afternoons that library also tried to take the 
weekly papers of these small towns. And the Tuley

07:32.376 --> 07:37.743
Herald came in here every, was over here on Sunday. 
And so we'd go over there and we'd scan the Tuley

07:38.585 --> 07:43.792
Herald, you know, those kids from Tuley, you know. 
And the other kids the same way. But we wanted to get

07:46.456 --> 07:50.241
the hometown papers, you know. But I, The library 
started growing by the time we were seniors, it had

07:51.518 --> 07:55.342
grown quite a bit. And of course now I think it's a 
real first-class library.

08:03.950 --> 08:07.894
Did you play any games of any sort in addition to the 
athletic games? I mean checkers, chess,

08:08.895 --> 08:12.539
dominoes? Yeah, you'd see some of that in the room. 
But there was no place to do that other than in your

08:16.082 --> 08:19.105
own dormitory room? Well, Wyham City. Okay. Did 
you have any favorite instructors? Well, you

08:28.739 --> 08:38.731
know, I've thought about that a whole lot since I 
got here, and they talk about what fine faculty

08:28.739 --> 08:38.731
they've got now, which they have. But I thought we 
had as good a faculty then, or the period we were in,

08:40.333 --> 08:47.402
as they've got now. Now, we had some outstanding 
people. You take a dean per year. He was from

08:53.213 --> 08:56.396
Virginia and he could have gone anywhere, I guess. 
He was a mathematician and he had somebody that was

08:56.757 --> 09:05.006
the author of a book that said over there on 
trigonometry, I believe. But, Dean Breyer, he was

09:06.588 --> 09:18.621
one of my favorites and he taught me one lesson 
that's been very helpful to me. When we were

09:21.164 --> 09:22.545
seniors, we had to take courses in sociology. And 
the first day of class, this teacher went over what

09:28.435 --> 09:42.412
he was going to have, and another boy on the staff 
decided that being an animal hunter, we'd really

09:28.435 --> 09:42.412
like to substitute another course for that if we 
could. So we matched, and I had to go see a dean per

09:43.974 --> 09:46.737
year. And I didn't know at that time that the 
teacher was the brother-in-law of old Dean. If I

09:52.428 --> 09:54.511
had, I'd have been scared to death to go in there. 
But I went in there. And so Dean, he was just one of

09:56.274 --> 10:01.522
those Virginia gentlemen. And make you feel at 
home, you know, and sit down there and wonder what

10:02.803 --> 10:07.991
he'd do for you. And I told him about the way Bap and I 
would like to substitute a course over here in

10:08.011 --> 10:18.407
Admiral Hudnery for a course we'd take into 
sociology. And so he said, put it in right. that

10:22.246 --> 10:26.611
Dean Puryear would never give you an answer unless 
you wrote him a letter. And then he had that on file.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.417
So I went back and had to write a letter. And when I 
wrote the letter to him, then he answered it and

10:33.478 --> 10:38.824
gave us permission to make that change. But then, 
if anything came up about that subject later, he

10:39.805 --> 10:48.194
had a file on his letter. Now that was real good. It 
sure hit me one time, because when I was a senior, I

10:51.878 --> 11:00.748
came back the next year to take graduate work. And 
Christmas, they had lost an instructor out here in

11:00.768 --> 11:11.060
Alamo-Hudnery, so they needed somebody to take 
over some courses in 107. And they asked me if I'd do

11:11.720 --> 11:13.442
that. Said I could still, I was taking three 
subjects, one master's. They said, you can drop

11:17.787 --> 11:20.130
one subject and take the other two. And the two I 
kept, one of them was genetics and one was

11:20.937 --> 11:24.322
veterinary physiology. And so when that term was 
over then, just about a month before the term was

11:25.504 --> 11:38.403
over, I was offered a job at the Santa Fe Railroad as 
Assistant General Ag Cuts Agent. And so I asked

11:38.423 --> 11:47.417
some of my instructors about it, and they said, 
well, I said, yeah, go ahead and take that. Add that

11:48.038 --> 11:49.179
to your experience. You can come back and get that 
master's any time. You take your exam on the

11:51.942 --> 11:57.547
physiology and genetics and have that behind you 
and all you need is just the subject and the thesis.

11:59.809 --> 12:04.013
So I took it and took those exams and all. So when I 
came back then, February the 1st, the

12:05.174 --> 12:15.143
experimentation offered me a job over here as the 
charge of swine investigations. And I left the

12:16.540 --> 12:19.763
railroad and came back here February the 1st, 
1925. And then I picked, that's when I left. I left

12:23.787 --> 12:25.548
on February the 1st. Well, I mean, at the end of that 
year, I left in June. So I picked up that, my course

12:29.172 --> 12:37.199
right at the beginning of that term, just like I 
left it, you know. And so they told me, they said,

12:38.160 --> 12:44.286
now you better get, the committee told me, you 
better stay up on your, genetics and physiology,

12:44.722 --> 12:48.707
you're going to have to take that exam, too, when 
you take it. Well, I'd already taken the exam, see?

12:51.150 --> 12:59.581
And before I did, I went up and I wrote Dean Perrier a 
letter and asked him would I have to take them again

12:51.150 --> 12:59.581
if I came back, and he wrote me a letter and told me I 
wouldn't. So then, I went up there and told Dean

13:00.682 --> 13:13.058
Perrier that this committee said that I had to take 
these exams on genetics and physiology when I

13:00.682 --> 13:13.058
finished my term out. I said, no, I wrote you a 
letter two years ago. And that showed you how

13:16.905 --> 13:21.291
important that was. Yeah, I had some favorite 
instructors, but I don't believe I had a bad one in

13:21.651 --> 13:27.098
the bunch. I just think we had some real good 
professors. Mr. Cofer was one of my favorites. He

13:32.905 --> 13:33.826
was an English professor. Then became a colleague 
of yours, I guess, for a long while. Yeah, he was a

13:37.651 --> 13:40.615
dandy.

13:41.759 --> 13:43.782
Well, Mr. Brayton. Mr. Brayton taught chemistry, 
freshman chemistry. At the fire. Brayton Field

13:50.472 --> 13:52.215
was named for him. And he was dandy. He was really 
good. But I just don't believe I had a story

13:55.439 --> 13:57.943
instructor. Did you have any courses under Dr. 
Francis? Yeah. Now, he was a good one. Did you ever

14:04.934 --> 14:09.320
hear the story about that old boy cheering in the 
back of one of his classes? I'm not sure that I have.

14:11.037 --> 14:15.943
Well, have you ever been in that Francis 
amphitheater where they have classes? Suits go up

14:15.963 --> 14:17.085
that way, you know. Yeah, I've been in there. Well, 
that's where the class was, and this old boy was

14:18.206 --> 14:23.172
sitting back up there, and he didn't think Dr. 
Francis would see him, hear him. Dr. Francis could

14:24.274 --> 14:29.320
hardly hear anyway, but he could hear what he 
wanted to. And this old boy, he was very big on the

14:29.340 --> 14:34.266
floor, and he didn't think Dr. Francis would see 
him. So one day, Dr. Francis came to the class, and

14:34.286 --> 14:39.913
he saw an old boy sitting up there, so he went back, 
got him a piece of rope and tied it to an old wash tub

14:40.417 --> 14:47.088
and dragged it down the hall, and acoustics in that 
building was terrible then. You could hear it all

14:47.569 --> 14:48.790
over the building. Dragged it down the hall, 
dragged it up the steps, up the other wall, sat down

14:48.811 --> 14:52.697
by the side of him. Says, fill her full, Rube.

14:59.968 --> 15:02.813
Oh, that Dr. Francis, he was something. I don't 
know how A&M kept those high-powered guys like

15:04.160 --> 15:09.085
that because that was back in the mud. We didn't 
have any sidewalks, didn't have anything. And

15:12.428 --> 15:13.529
they could have gone anywhere. Like Breyer and 
Francis and Dr. Ball over in the botany. We just had

15:20.635 --> 15:23.017
a lot of those high-powered guys, I thought. And 
John Burns, who was head of the Ambulance Hub

15:24.419 --> 15:30.344
Department, he finished here in 1904. And he's one 
of the Charter of Memories that organized the

15:34.720 --> 15:40.186
American Society of Animal Production. But Mr. 
Burns was an even outstanding man. He was a

15:45.211 --> 15:47.394
full-blood Scotsman. That's a good Scotch name, 
you know. Yeah, when I was in Lubbock, I talked with

15:50.457 --> 15:54.982
his younger brother. You did? D. Burns. Well, I'll 
declare it. Yeah, I do D. Well. He was his, let's

15:59.386 --> 16:01.909
see, he was here He was ahead of me. Yeah,

16:05.451 --> 16:14.001
he's retired from the Guthrie, Pitchfork branch 
in Guthrie.

16:19.407 --> 16:23.291
We talked a little bit about Dr. Brazell a few 
minutes ago. What were the general attitudes of

16:23.351 --> 16:31.761
the students towards Dr. Brazell as president? 
Well,

16:32.045 --> 16:54.935
of course, to speak myself, it couldn't have been 
any better, but there were a few students long,

16:32.045 --> 16:54.935
well, about a year after I graduated, long in 
there, in the cavalry round over there. The

16:57.378 --> 16:59.200
cavalry had some pretty rough guy in there at that 
time. They

17:03.735 --> 17:10.064
thought Dr. DeSalle was stupid on them sometimes. 
He'd come over to his office at night and he'd see a

17:10.805 --> 17:17.856
light burning up there and a little noise up there. 
Instead of letting the military take care of that,

17:18.898 --> 17:23.244
he took it on himself, which he shouldn't have 
done. But he did and they didn't like that and they

17:24.426 --> 17:27.851
got with it. They'd throw water on him when he'd 
come back home from go past that Leggett Hall.

17:35.423 --> 17:40.990
Those upside out there had some banisters or 
something around there, not there now. And they'd

17:41.510 --> 17:43.873
get out there and they'd throw out water on them 
when they'd come by there. He left here in 25, went

17:46.436 --> 17:53.605
to the University of Oklahoma, and just made an 
outstanding success there like he did here. And

17:54.209 --> 17:55.671
they built a building up there. I think it may be the 
library. I forget. They built some building up

17:58.696 --> 18:01.900
there named after him. But I just thought he was an 
outstanding president. He did a lot for A&M. And he

18:08.870 --> 18:10.853
came in 14, left 25.

18:13.898 --> 18:21.128
But

18:13.898 --> 18:21.128
some of them, he, Dr. Lavelle, Some of them 
boyettes down here didn't like him and gave him a

18:22.019 --> 18:27.170
lot of trouble. One reason why I ask is because I 
always had the impression from, you know, when I

18:28.613 --> 18:39.437
first came here that Dr. Brazell was one of the 
leading lights as an administrator for A&M for

18:28.613 --> 18:39.437
many years. And since that time, though, a man who 
had been here as a student in the mid-20s brought in

18:39.907 --> 18:53.246
a, I guess you'd call it an underground student 
newspaper from, I believe, 1924 called The Long

18:39.907 --> 18:53.246
Bat. And there was an editorial in there that 
seemed to indicate that there was some

18:54.207 --> 19:00.116
dissatisfaction. And I think it was, well, one of 
the issues that came scrapped up many, many times

19:00.817 --> 19:09.289
since then is the matter of censorship or 
inappropriate you know, not having the privilege

19:10.282 --> 19:30.946
to say what you really think, and they made the 
comment that if you don't think this is true, this

19:10.282 --> 19:30.946
was in an editorial, if you don't think this is true 
that you can't say what you think, well, get up in

19:10.282 --> 19:30.946
the middle of the academic building and say what 
you think, and then count how long it is until the

19:10.282 --> 19:30.946
next train comes through, and that's how long you 
had to stay here. Well, of course, they criticized

19:32.107 --> 19:38.955
Jesus Christ, you know, and And you can ask a guy 
like E. McQuillan. He was a 20-man. He was under

19:45.878 --> 19:47.160
Brazil. I'll bet you he would give them a real A-1 
rating. Well, almost everybody I have talked to

19:52.067 --> 20:01.019
has done so, and this makes his editorial in his 
underground newspaper even more puzzling. Yeah.

20:02.261 --> 20:05.545
Well, I don't know why anyone would do that. Dr. 
Bell, he was... You remember we were, in those

20:08.888 --> 20:14.856
periods, discipline was number one. You had to 
have, you couldn't get by stuff like you do now,

20:14.876 --> 20:21.544
you know. The old timers believed in discipline 
and law and order and all that kind of stuff. And Dr.

20:29.134 --> 20:36.043
Zell was in that period and, you know, before Dr. 
Zell came here, There'd been guys canned out of

20:37.795 --> 20:41.860
here smoking cigarettes on the campus. You 
couldn't even smoke a cigarette. And up at Baylor,

20:44.344 --> 20:55.959
Pat Depp and that bunch of guys, well, they'd can 
you out of Baylor right now if you were smoking up

20:44.344 --> 20:55.959
there in those days. But when Dr. Bell

20:56.439 --> 21:04.630
had been here after the war, all that changed a 
little bit because during the war you know

21:05.403 --> 21:14.324
everybody's

21:05.403 --> 21:14.324
and all the company and all had the cigarettes and 
stuff like that. I wondered you know after my

21:15.667 --> 21:23.766
initial reaction to this editorial and the 
comments I had had about Dr. Brazell since then, I

21:24.083 --> 21:32.795
wondered whether perhaps that editorial was 
aimed at the commandant instead of... It could

21:32.875 --> 21:35.819
have been at the commandant, yeah. It wasn't Ike 
Ashburn, though. It was that fellow Muller before

21:37.181 --> 21:39.424
him. He was pretty hard. Muller was commandant 
when you were here as a student? Yes, Fish, yeah.

21:49.739 --> 21:51.101
And was he followed by Ashburn? Yeah. during your 
sophomore year. Yeah, the aspirin. The aspirin

21:54.680 --> 21:56.522
was real good. He stayed on for all of the... See, 
aspirin came back from the war, from the major. And

22:02.107 --> 22:05.249
he's the one who got that cigarette thing changed, 
I think. And a few things changed like that. But he

22:11.094 --> 22:14.698
was a lovable fellow, that fellow aspirin was. He

22:15.979 --> 22:21.023
was later, I think... on Dr. Walton's staff. Dr. 
Walton was made president following Brazell. I

22:31.127 --> 22:37.894
believe, I know he, Ashburn served in a number of 
capacities as an information officer and some

22:31.127 --> 22:37.894
things of that nature. Yeah. So, but he was very 
highly regarded then. Oh yeah, yeah, he was a

22:42.299 --> 22:44.181
danger. He was out of the military though. Yes, 
that's right. He was out of the military. Dr.

22:50.848 --> 22:52.410
Brazell was Dr.

22:52.930 --> 23:01.218
Rozelle was really highly regarded by his staff 
here. And I was, when

23:03.019 --> 23:19.054
I came back from my masters, a guy named Johnston 
and Hooten Williams. Hooten Williams was one of

23:19.074 --> 23:22.397
the good, best basketball players here. 
Williamson Johnson were chemistry majors, and I

23:22.732 --> 23:26.558
was animal science. We came back here to work on our 
matches, and they put us over there in Austin Hall,

23:26.578 --> 23:31.725
which is not here anymore. That is one of the old 
dormitories. It wasn't much of a dormitory. They

23:36.412 --> 23:37.373
had to carry wood. So they put us in there, and we 
didn't want to be there. We wanted to be in Alpha

23:42.000 --> 23:43.181
Hall. Of course, it's gone now, too. But it's 
bigger, and the rooms are bigger, and we thought it

23:45.485 --> 23:50.512
would be better for us. We could study better. So we

23:52.313 --> 24:02.609
went to Dr. Brazell, and these other two boys were 
at a class, and they asked me to go. And I went up to

24:02.649 --> 24:10.822
see Dr. Brazell, and when I told him the problem, he 
just got up out of his chair and said, let's go down

24:02.649 --> 24:10.822
to the commandant's office. That's what I came 
for. And there was some military men in there at the

24:13.426 --> 24:15.349
same time. We went in, and when Dr. Brazell came in, 
everybody came to his feet. They respected Dr.

24:20.478 --> 24:23.862
Zell and treated him real royal. And Dr. Zell got 
that chance. He just asked, he didn't, he wasn't

24:28.287 --> 24:30.869
adamant about it. He just says, we have three 
students, Colonel Ashburn, call him Colonel, or

24:30.889 --> 24:45.926
yeah, I believe it, that would like to room over in 
Alfa Hall and say, you think you could arrange

24:30.889 --> 24:45.926
that? He says, here we go. Oh yeah, he says, we can do 
this. That's all there was to it. But I was

24:50.043 --> 24:54.087
impressed the way they came to their feet when he 
entered the door. I believe I've been told that

24:55.148 --> 25:01.695
Alpha and Beta were places where non-military 
students lived. Yes, they did, and then some

25:02.096 --> 25:06.060
graduate students. Were there graduate students 
primarily in Austin Hall, too? Well, I don't know.

25:13.508 --> 25:19.594
We thought it was used at that time for waiters over 
in MS Hall, some of them. Speezer was, he was

25:20.722 --> 25:26.448
Spanish or some kind of a thing. I knew Speezer. But 
I think he got some of his boys out of Puerto Rico and

25:28.850 --> 25:33.575
I don't know where else. But I think they, it was 
over there. But Alpha was a pretty nice hall and

25:35.397 --> 25:38.600
Beta too. Just more like home, like you lived at 
home, you know. As a graduate student, did you have

25:44.526 --> 25:46.929
to wear a uniform? No. No, you wore civilian 
clothing. Yeah, yeah. But even at that point, did

25:50.607 --> 25:54.933
all the undergraduates have to wear uniforms? In 
the cadet corps, yeah. And that was, we thought

25:59.260 --> 26:02.124
that was the place to be then. We really, I think we 
enjoyed it. We know that from time to time a number

26:07.633 --> 26:14.022
of the students, in a sense, worked their way 
through school. Did you ever have a job when you

26:14.483 --> 26:17.307
were in school? I wish I had had. My observation of 
the boys who worked the way through school made

26:22.866 --> 26:33.298
acquaintance with more professors and more 
administrators and I think they have an

26:22.866 --> 26:33.298
advantage. Actually, the kid who worked his way 
through school. Well, our President Ford worked

26:36.883 --> 26:40.527
his way through school. But I did, my dad

26:41.308 --> 26:47.395
just furnished me the money to come down here. Now,

26:50.003 --> 26:57.556
for my master's though, after I was 21, I wouldn't 
take any more money from my dad. And so I borrowed

26:58.577 --> 27:01.442
some money and then I got a scholarship down here. 
And for my master's,

27:02.464 --> 27:09.315
we...

27:15.269 --> 27:38.492
uh didn't have to wear a uniform but uh I didn't I 
didn't have to work away but they did borrow money

27:15.269 --> 27:38.492
to go to school and

27:15.269 --> 27:38.492
and they talk about our interest now well this is uh 
in the fall of 22 and I had to pay 10 interest on that

27:15.269 --> 27:38.492
money That was from a bank? Yeah. But then, but the 
second semester of that graduate year, while you

27:41.594 --> 27:47.363
were doing some teaching, so you had an income. 
Yes, yeah, I sure did. Part-time. And I'm

27:50.488 --> 27:51.770
presuming that helped out. Yeah, it did. It helped 
me pay that $300 off my bar. Scholarship was just

27:57.479 --> 27:58.360
$200. Of course, going to school then wasn't like 
it is now. The scholarship was when you were

28:01.866 --> 28:03.949
working on your master's? Yeah.

28:07.210 --> 28:13.677
We know that at various times, on different 
occasions, there were girls who did attend

28:07.210 --> 28:13.677
classes. Did you ever have any in your classes? No. 
About the only girls that went to A&M then were the

28:17.601 --> 28:22.106
daughters of the faculty. I think Dr. Zell's 
daughter went to school here a little while, and

28:23.167 --> 28:30.656
maybe Dr. Fraps. Dr. Fraps was state chemist over 
here. He had a daughter I think went to school here.

28:37.788 --> 28:49.522
and

28:37.788 --> 28:49.522
I don't know where Dr. Walden's, either went to 
school here or not, but there were a few girls like

28:37.788 --> 28:49.522
that, very few girls went to school here. No 
thanks. Okay. I

28:53.306 --> 29:04.740
did a little checking in your 22, Longhorn. Did 
you? You noted that you were on the international

29:07.189 --> 29:10.272
stock judging team. Yes. I presume that was on your 
senior year? Yes. How did you become a member of

29:13.996 --> 29:15.598
that? By trying out for our, we had to, we'd take 
this livestock over here, and different barns,

29:16.399 --> 29:29.012
and they had hogs, beef cattle, horses, and sheep. 
And you'd have classes to place and give reasons

29:29.732 --> 29:34.137
on. Mr. Stangle, who was later dean out at Texas 
Tech, was our coach. And he'd grade you on your

29:40.708 --> 29:43.753
placings and on your greasings. And it was 
competitive. You got on there by competition. So

29:51.526 --> 29:55.353
how many of the students were on the team? Five. And 
each member, each one of each... did you

29:59.024 --> 30:01.788
specialize in one type of lifestyle? Everybody 
had to do all of them. Now when I was a fish,

30:06.075 --> 30:13.266
we had a freshman lifestyle judging contest at the 
end of the freshman year. And I looked out on that, I

30:14.688 --> 30:22.421
was high man of the freshman lifestyle judging 
contest and won a medal. And in 1920 I lost that

30:22.441 --> 30:24.524
medal. It was A.M. Walter medal. It was a hexagon 
shaped thing and I lost it in 1920. I did no work. In

30:34.676 --> 30:44.448
1940, 20 years later, we were going up to see our 
folks and we had a son at that time, nine years old.

30:45.028 --> 30:52.217
We stopped at Leonard's other store in Fort Worth 
and bought an iron gun for him to shoot when he went

30:45.028 --> 30:52.217
up there. So in Tuna, we lived on a city block and had 
a barn, an orchard and garden, chicken, all that

30:52.467 --> 31:00.806
kind of stuff. So he was out there in the lot looking 
for something to put up on the fence to shoot at and

31:00.826 --> 31:07.862
kicked up that metal. 20 years after I lost it.
