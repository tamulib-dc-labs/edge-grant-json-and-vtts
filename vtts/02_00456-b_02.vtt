WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:20.655
So it was kind of a shock to leave Vietnam where we 
were sitting and waiting on aircraft to pick us up

00:01.330 --> 00:20.655
that we didn't know whether or not it was going to 
get off the ground or not and hoping that it didn't

00:01.330 --> 00:20.655
get blowed away before we got out of the country. 
all of a sudden in 16 hours you're back in

00:21.158 --> 00:24.102
civilization. So it was a quick change that was a 
culture shock to you. The culture was kind of quite

00:31.312 --> 00:36.158
different in Vietnam. Yeah, quite different. It 
was a pretty filthy place. Lots of rats, lots of

00:42.807 --> 00:50.237
black plague,

00:42.807 --> 00:50.237
lots of infection, lots of You know, wounds didn't 
heal good there because of the infection in the

00:50.960 --> 00:58.387
field.

00:58.848 --> 01:06.836
People were morally, you know, Vietnamese people 
didn't have a whole lot to live for, the majority,

00:58.848 --> 01:06.836
unless you were upper class, you know. The French. 
Yeah. And they, you know, women used the bathroom

01:09.899 --> 01:17.406
on the roads, you know, in front of everybody, you 
know. Men did too. It didn't make any difference.

01:20.560 --> 01:27.270
You know, so there, it was kind of, culture was kind 
of bad.

01:31.696 --> 01:38.426
So, we had mama sons, took care of our stuff, you 
know, washed our clothes. Of course, they washed

01:38.687 --> 01:45.076
our clothes with rice soap and beat them with rocks 
so they didn't last a long time, you know. And, uh,

01:46.867 --> 01:48.489
But we paid them $5 a month. And they'd polish our 
boots and wash our clothes and anything we needed

01:49.229 --> 02:01.962
to cook, whatever, for $5. So later on, after you'd 
been there a while and you were able to get some

02:02.342 --> 02:09.129
food, they cooked it for you. Yeah, well, they'd 
cook theirs if you could eat it. Oh, I see. They'd

02:12.932 --> 02:14.494
cook their monkey. Back to the monkeys, right? 
Well, you know, I never saw the monosons eating

02:15.824 --> 02:20.171
meat. They ate mostly plants of some kind. I don't 
know. I guess something like spinach on that

02:25.399 --> 02:29.325
order, greens of some kind. Stonk. Oh, it wasn't 
spinach then. No, probably not. Did you go into

02:34.873 --> 02:35.855
Saigon? Yeah. What was it like? Saigon was filthy, 
just like I just described. Really? Yeah. Well,

02:42.765 --> 02:44.548
that was kind of a modern city. It was supposed to be 
the Paris of the Orient. That's what I thought.

02:48.404 --> 02:49.746
That's why I heard that. But it wasn't. It was 
filthy. Well, have you ever heard about Paris?

02:55.655 --> 02:56.377
Yeah. Paris is not your cleanest thing either. 
It's pretty filthy in Paris. Saigon. The problem

03:02.406 --> 03:13.303
in Saigon, most guys would tell you that, a lot of 
guys would tell you that they'd rather be in the

03:02.406 --> 03:13.303
jungle where you shot whoever came out than to be in 
Saigon where you got shot because you didn't know.

03:19.698 --> 03:25.903
Lots of people got killed in Saigon, terrorists 
killing people every day, gobs of them. I'll tell

03:25.923 --> 03:35.812
you, I believe the 716th MPs in Saigon was involved 
in as much or more combat than anybody in Vietnam.

03:35.832 --> 03:39.975
Their headquarters got hit every day by mortar 
rounds. From VC. Yeah, their living quarters.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.134
every day. Did they have any Air Force security 
placement there? Oh, yeah. Lots. I was going to ask

03:50.203 --> 03:53.087
you a while ago approximately how many you had 
towed. We had about a thousand. You had a thousand

03:54.489 --> 03:58.976
that drove at Gardner Bay? Yeah. We had security 
patrols, then we had machine gun emplacements,

04:00.197 --> 04:06.446
and then we had towers. And we pulled those 
ditties, you know, we shared those ditties, and

04:07.588 --> 04:12.315
we'd We would police until 11 o'clock curfew, and 
then at 11 o'clock we'd go into machine gun bunkers

04:13.274 --> 04:21.285
and guard the perimeter.

04:25.591 --> 04:31.840
Sometimes you'd be in a machine gun jeep, 
patrolling mobile.

04:33.242 --> 04:41.593
We traded 10 cots one time for an APC, an armored 
personnel carrier, and it had two 30-caliber

04:33.242 --> 04:41.593
machine guns on it. And it was pretty wild. Nobody 
knew how to operate the machine guns because it was

04:44.436 --> 04:47.781
remote control. We drove it around for a while. Did 
it scare the Vietnamese? Oh, yeah, they liked it.

04:55.774 --> 04:57.417
They liked that thing. But that's what you did. 
Well,

05:01.063 --> 05:06.392
I think it's about time we wound this up. But could 
you... First of all, but before we do, I'd like to

05:09.080 --> 05:15.588
know how you felt after you came back to the United 
States. Very, very bitter. And hearing, but how

05:17.170 --> 05:21.476
did you feel when you heard the news and you knew it 
was wrong? Is that what made you so bitter? What was

05:23.759 --> 05:24.339
wrong? When you knew they were lying to the 
American people, the politicians were lying to

05:24.600 --> 05:34.632
the American people about what was going on, and 
you couldn't say anything about it, you couldn't

05:24.600 --> 05:34.632
do anything about it? I don't know how I felt. You 
said you were bitter. I was bitter because of the

05:39.777 --> 05:47.488
way the American people did the veterans while 
they were overseas. Up until just a few years ago, I

05:49.070 --> 05:53.356
was very, very bitter. I still feel that the 
American people killed as many GIs in Vietnam as

05:54.858 --> 06:01.788
the enemy did. I feel like that they were 
responsible for a lot of the the deaths, the

06:08.530 --> 06:11.234
American deaths in Vietnam. Are you aware that 
there's only about two paragraphs in the history

06:12.075 --> 06:20.706
books nowadays concerning the Vietnam War and 
some that's not even in there? I guess probably

06:20.726 --> 06:24.150
because it's such an embarrassment. Do you think 
that even in spite of whether it's the fact that

06:24.170 --> 06:30.378
it's an embarrassment that the American children 
should study about it? Sure, I think they should. I

06:32.201 --> 06:35.445
think they should know the truth about it. I think 
it's wrong for them to to get away with a bunch of

06:38.298 --> 06:45.868
lies that shields a lot of that stuff. No one will 
ever convince me that the American position, the

06:48.312 --> 07:07.478
majority, or I feel like the majority, the 
feelings of the soldier in Vietnam did not kill a

06:48.312 --> 07:07.478
lot, a lot of soldiers, American soldiers. and 
caused their death in Vietnam. You know, there was

07:10.456 --> 07:20.428
a lot of anti-war movements

07:10.456 --> 07:20.428
going on in the United States. Were you aware that 
this was just a small minority of the student

07:20.828 --> 07:29.278
population, or even the population of the United 
States? No. We were never told. We always heard

07:32.382 --> 07:34.564
about all the demonstrations. We were never told 
about anything good. Well, they were a very small

07:37.141 --> 07:41.685
minority. The good or the bad? The people who were 
demonstrators, the anti-war demonstrators,

07:44.047 --> 07:50.814
were a very small minority of the United States. 
See, we were told, you know, the way it was

07:51.834 --> 07:59.261
projected to us was different. I think a lot of the 
reason that people felt the way they did, people

07:59.341 --> 08:06.608
that didn't demonstrate it felt bad about 
Vietnam. I don't think they understood about

08:11.927 --> 08:15.470
Vietnam. And I know that's still a fact. And like 
you said, they need to know. There's so many people

08:21.676 --> 08:28.602
now, teenagers, whatnot, that have no idea, don't 
have a clue what went on. A lot of them think, well,

08:28.622 --> 08:37.270
if you were stationed in Saigon, you never saw 
anything. You just said differently, didn't you?

08:40.328 --> 08:42.570
Oh, yeah, just like 716th MPs. The Tet Offensive, 
Saigon was leveled. You know, the Tet Offensive,

08:46.774 --> 08:51.058
American fighters strafed Saigon. You know, I 
mean, blew it all to pieces. They had to, but they

08:53.380 --> 08:55.522
blew it all to pieces. Tonsnoot was right outside 
of Saigon. I know personally because of guys that I

08:59.606 --> 09:05.552
left there that came to where I was... That fought 
for 16 solid days. You know, and right there. It

09:14.068 --> 09:16.491
didn't matter where you were at there. People 
don't understand that. Lots of people, you know,

09:18.854 --> 09:22.960
don't understand that. That there wasn't, and 
it's because of World War II and whatnot, that

09:23.360 --> 09:29.008
there wasn't a front, you know. a place where you 
could fall back. This is the front. We'll go up

09:33.341 --> 09:34.963
there and then we'll fall back. You're safe. No 
place in Vietnam was safe is what you're saying.

09:40.072 --> 09:42.656
No. No place was safe. Well, I think that the 
comments that you've made and the information

09:44.900 --> 09:56.599
that you have passed on going into the archives of 
Texas A&M University We'll give the historians

09:58.098 --> 10:11.802
ammunition to, if you will use the word 
ammunition, to, because we're the ones that fight

09:58.098 --> 10:11.802
to get things put in history textbooks. Right. I 
understand that. The United States, this is not

10:15.589 --> 10:18.755
the only thing the United States has liked to cover 
up. They like to cover up a lot of the racism in the

10:18.775 --> 10:21.560
South. Mm-hmm. And lots of things they'd like to 
cover up, but historians keep bringing it out. And

10:30.751 --> 10:38.303
I guess we're kind of a group of people that are kind 
of pioneers, just as people in space. I'd like to

10:38.383 --> 10:50.481
think that we're doing our thing just as much as 
people in space towards getting an unknown that's

10:38.383 --> 10:50.481
right here on Earth. across to the people. I intend 
as a teacher to teach my students about the Vietnam

10:53.900 --> 11:04.952
War from all aspects of it because I believe that 
they should understand it.

11:10.018 --> 11:11.259
Let me ask you one last question. After some of the 
statements you made, I was wondering how you feel

11:11.299 --> 11:15.844
about every young person, girl or boy, being 
required to spend at least two years in the service

11:16.178 --> 11:24.774
after they graduate from high school? Do I think 
they should? How do you feel about that? Girl and

11:27.539 --> 11:28.240
boy? I don't think a girl should be. I think a guy 
should be. Why not the girls? The girls are asking

11:33.590 --> 11:37.377
for liberate, they want to be liberated. Well, if 
they want to be, then let them. I don't know. I'm not

11:40.493 --> 11:42.656
saying send them into combat. I'm just saying put 
them in the military to learn this discipline that

11:42.696 --> 11:46.361
you talked about. I don't know that I'm in favor of 
the girls doing it. Maybe that's just because I was

11:50.346 --> 11:52.308
raised that way. I don't know. But I think the draft 
ought to be back. If not, I think a guy would be

12:00.499 --> 12:05.946
better off to go Four years out of my life, I gave at 
the wrong time, I feel like. I feel like I should

12:13.529 --> 12:20.863
have done it from the time I was 20 until I was 25, or 
almost 25. I think those were important years in my

12:22.058 --> 12:24.341
life. Well, that's why I said two years instead of 
four years. Right, I agree. Before that, it was two

12:28.346 --> 12:29.407
years. Now, the Air Force, in order to volunteer in 
the other militaries, but the Army was only

12:29.968 --> 12:37.738
taking, you had to go four years, but the Army was 
doing two years. I think two years is right, and I

12:37.758 --> 12:42.985
think that they should go right after they get out 
of high school. And I think our military would be

12:43.946 --> 12:46.349
better. I mean, it's proven fact. There's no 
question about it. that the military was better

12:49.868 --> 12:53.954
when the draft was there because you got 
everybody. Some of those guys that was really good

12:54.915 --> 13:04.449
and really smart didn't go back to civilian jobs 
and make careers out of the military because they

12:54.915 --> 13:04.449
lacked it or something. But now, you never get 
those guys to start with, so they never get exposed

13:06.192 --> 13:12.641
to any of it. I think the discipline is important. I 
think our... Population needs the discipline. I

13:20.914 --> 13:25.700
mean, I think maybe that's contributed to drugs 
somewhat, too. I don't know. But I think it should

13:27.462 --> 13:32.988
be, I think the draft, if nothing else, they should 
reinstitute the draft. I think that threat, it was

13:33.028 --> 13:36.212
hanging over me. There was jobs I couldn't get 
because I hadn't been drafted. I hadn't been in the

13:39.996 --> 13:41.177
service. They wouldn't even talk to me. And I think 
that creates jobs. for people. I think there'd be a

13:50.060 --> 13:59.570
lot more employment, you know, available if ever a 
kid that come out of high school had the draft

13:50.060 --> 13:59.570
looking at him. And he had to do that survey 
obligation before. You know, most guys, when I

14:03.974 --> 14:08.899
came out of the high school, I didn't have a clue 
what I was going to do. And most guys don't. Most

14:12.403 --> 14:13.043
people don't. No. And that two years would be very 
valuable in deciding that, you know. Yeah, I think

14:18.327 --> 14:20.911
it's important. Well, I'd like to thank you, 
Ronnie, very much for your time. This has been a

14:24.637 --> 14:28.963
time away from your family. It's been my pleasure. 
And I do appreciate it, and hopefully what you've

14:30.866 --> 14:41.683
said tonight, and I believe it will help the 
future, make the future safer for your children

14:30.866 --> 14:41.683
and your grandchildren. Well, I hope so. Thank 
you. Thank you.
