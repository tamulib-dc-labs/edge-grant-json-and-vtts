WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:04.127
along about the third day.

00:05.329 --> 00:07.612
And the whole thing lasted how long?

00:07.912 --> 00:08.352
Ten days.

00:08.432 --> 00:09.634
Ten days, that's what I thought.

00:09.654 --> 00:15.501
And then it was just bunches of them leaving each day.

00:15.821 --> 00:17.163
Did you ever think about leaving?

00:17.183 --> 00:17.463
Never.

00:18.464 --> 00:18.845
No sir.

00:18.865 --> 00:25.953
So did you, did, so you and two or three close friends never talked about what if?

00:26.714 --> 00:26.934
No.

00:27.435 --> 00:28.416
Okay.

00:29.277 --> 00:30.038
I was a senior.

00:31.259 --> 00:32.080
There were only,

00:33.275 --> 00:43.351
12 of us out there left, and I mean, gee whiz, quitting wasn't any option.

00:47.317 --> 00:50.762
Did Coach Bryant ever talk to you seniors?

00:51.263 --> 00:51.624
No.

00:51.644 --> 00:53.306
In any kind of relaxed manner?

00:54.408 --> 00:54.648
No.

00:55.490 --> 01:00.818
He would talk to Marvin Tate,

01:02.080 --> 01:06.206
because Marvin was kind of a team leader.

01:06.847 --> 01:10.773
He would talk to Benny Sinclair who became the captain of the team that year.

01:12.776 --> 01:17.083
Benny was a very religious, good kid, still is to this very day.

01:17.163 --> 01:22.671
He lives over here at the Woodlands in that general area.

01:24.220 --> 01:30.569
He's the one that asked Coach Bryant to cut back on the cursing.

01:33.113 --> 01:34.816
There's a long story about that.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.418
What was the response?

01:38.701 --> 01:44.089
Oh, he said he'd get a can and every time he cursed, he'd put some money in it.

01:48.656 --> 01:53.603
Then when it reached a million dollars, we'd go buy something.

01:54.646 --> 01:56.608
No, he never quit.

01:57.248 --> 02:10.761
And let's see, among the people that I became well-acquainted with at church here was Drake, Bobby Drake, Keith.

02:12.102 --> 02:17.247
And he would have been a sophomore, I guess.

02:17.727 --> 02:22.712
He was here a year before he and Gene played together.

02:23.047 --> 02:31.018
Now, those who dropped out, not only did they drop out of football, they left A&M, didn't they?

02:31.038 --> 02:31.559
Generally.

02:32.981 --> 02:36.826
And in general, they were from all classes, freshman through?

02:37.748 --> 02:38.028
Yes.

02:38.549 --> 02:41.072
Did you start out with 12 seniors?

02:42.735 --> 02:47.281
Do you remember how many, or were there 12 left when Junction was over?

02:47.902 --> 02:50.826
There were 12 left in the Junction crew.

02:51.211 --> 02:54.256
Do you remember how many y'all started out, how many seniors y'all started out with?

03:00.325 --> 03:02.608
I may be wrong on this point.

03:07.997 --> 03:10.661
I think Fred Broussard was the only senior.

03:11.041 --> 03:11.462
Let's see.

03:12.303 --> 03:13.545
Well, Joe Boring quit.

03:13.565 --> 03:14.407
He was a senior.

03:14.847 --> 03:16.430
But Joe didn't drop out of school.

03:16.470 --> 03:19.294
He went ahead and played baseball.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.604
That's all of the seniors.

03:24.287 --> 03:28.211
Well, let's see, maybe one of the Robbins boys would have been a senior that year.

03:28.472 --> 03:29.273
I'm not sure of that.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.976
There were two, actually three of the Robbins brothers.

03:33.718 --> 03:43.211
As far as you know, did any coach ever try to persuade some potential drop out or dropper outer to stay?

03:43.811 --> 03:45.113
Hey, don't leave, we need you.

03:45.253 --> 03:49.078
Did the coaches ever, any of the assistant coaches ever attempt that?

03:49.244 --> 03:50.286
Not that I'm aware of.

03:50.946 --> 03:52.268
I've never heard of any such.

03:53.731 --> 03:57.676
If Coach Bryant heard of it, he'd probably fire him.

03:57.696 --> 04:11.877
Now were, as you look back on it, were there, was there any assistant coach in his style that was more likely not to use the strong language

04:12.413 --> 04:20.903
that was more sensitive, that in hindsight was a, was, was more, you know, was a better person?

04:21.563 --> 04:22.624
Oh, yes.

04:22.645 --> 04:23.686
Who, who would that have been?

04:24.026 --> 04:24.607
All of them.

04:24.627 --> 04:25.708
Oh, all of them.

04:25.728 --> 04:26.929
Oh, okay, okay.

04:26.949 --> 04:28.571
Starting with Jim Owens.

04:28.591 --> 04:30.013
Okay.

04:30.413 --> 04:31.214
All of them.

04:31.234 --> 04:32.055
Okay.

04:32.075 --> 04:38.202
All of them were better people than Coach Bryant

04:38.502 --> 04:49.618
And the way they treated young people, the way they spoke, the way they behaved, they were better role models than he was.

04:50.199 --> 04:55.787
Now, in the summer of 59, I had a temporary job at Schreiner Institute.

04:56.908 --> 05:00.854
And also there with me was a young man named S.M.

05:00.874 --> 05:03.177
Meeks, whose dad was here.

05:03.275 --> 05:05.537
Was he the equipment manager when you were here?

05:05.978 --> 05:06.899
No.

05:06.919 --> 05:08.080
Monk Meeks wasn't here yet?

05:08.881 --> 05:08.941
No.

05:08.961 --> 05:09.061
Okay.

05:09.081 --> 05:09.301
No.

05:10.082 --> 05:11.303
All right then.

05:11.323 --> 05:20.552
Billy Pickard was our principal manager and all around equipment man.

05:20.572 --> 05:21.513
Billy handled everything.

05:21.653 --> 05:21.753
Yeah.

05:21.774 --> 05:24.716
Beginning as a student and then up until this very day.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.038
Billy's a good man.

05:26.638 --> 05:30.002
Do you remember by chance what you weighed at the start of that?

05:30.622 --> 05:30.903
Oh yes.

05:30.923 --> 05:33.265
Training session and what you weighed when you came back?

05:33.818 --> 05:40.465
I weighed 195 when I started and that was after going through six months of hard training at Fort Knox.

05:42.247 --> 05:48.495
And when I came back I weighed less than 185, rehydrated.

05:48.975 --> 05:51.077
I lost about 10 pounds out there.

05:52.038 --> 05:54.942
I wasn't fat to begin with.

05:55.022 --> 05:55.963
I was in good shape.

05:56.483 --> 06:02.290
Did Coach Bryant say, as you all were leaving Junction, did he say anything to those of you that were survivors?

06:05.560 --> 06:10.307
No, let me say this, Dr. Monroe.

06:11.548 --> 06:25.187
I want to tell you just briefly the relationship or lack thereof that I had with Coach Bryant.

06:26.028 --> 06:34.420
I thought, like I told you after spring training, that I had performed well and I was ready to have a good senior year.

06:34.754 --> 06:45.948
previous year I had hurt my right knee pretty badly five days before the first game and I didn't even let her that year because of that.

06:47.850 --> 07:02.888
And so I was rehabbed and was in good shape my senior year and I was looking forward to a good year, not because of anything special, just because I loved playing football.

07:03.728 --> 07:07.512
I was looking forward to having a good year and enjoying playing football.

07:07.532 --> 07:24.549
Coach Bryant took all the joy out of football, but beyond that or above that, when I showed up in front of Walton Hall that day, he was there and he immediately, he didn't say, hello, how are you?

07:25.429 --> 07:26.971
Do you have a good summer or anything?

07:27.011 --> 07:31.035
He said, Hall, what's this I hear about you getting married?

07:32.163 --> 07:34.346
I smiled and I said, yes, sir, that's right.

07:37.771 --> 07:39.534
There wasn't any smile on his face.

07:40.255 --> 07:47.806
He had that snarl on his face and he says, don't you know you can't play football on this team and be married?

07:50.470 --> 07:51.532
I didn't know what to say.

07:54.356 --> 08:01.326
From that moment on, Dr. Monroe, I don't believe that

08:01.778 --> 08:12.871
For the rest of the season, Coach Bryant ever looked me in the eye and ever said anything personally to me.

08:13.251 --> 08:14.152
I was just there.

08:15.694 --> 08:20.680
I was a body that he ignored.

08:20.720 --> 08:31.532
In hindsight, did you and your friends think that the purpose of the Junction program was to chase a bunch of people off?

08:32.137 --> 08:32.858
Absolutely.

08:33.218 --> 08:34.119
That's what I assumed.

08:37.101 --> 08:40.724
He didn't like what he saw in spring training and he was going to do something about it.

08:40.764 --> 08:46.169
He was going to sort the wheat from the chaff if there was any wheat and that's what he went out there for.

08:46.830 --> 08:54.516
Now in that bunch of, in that first freshman class, did you upperclassmen think there were some talented people he had recruited?

08:57.699 --> 08:58.100
Oh yes.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.001
You all recognize that?

09:00.241 --> 09:02.143
Oh yeah.

09:02.562 --> 09:07.667
We would, you know, we didn't practice together, didn't play together.

09:07.687 --> 09:09.488
They had their own separate freshman schedule.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.529
They played five games.

09:10.690 --> 09:11.891
But they went out to Junction?

09:12.451 --> 09:13.432
No, no.

09:13.452 --> 09:14.433
No, no.

09:14.453 --> 09:15.394
Oh, I thought that.

09:15.414 --> 09:16.035
None of them went.

09:16.595 --> 09:17.876
Oh, I didn't know that.

09:17.896 --> 09:18.297
Okay.

09:18.317 --> 09:19.638
A while ago you said freshman.

09:19.678 --> 09:20.319
I missed that.

09:20.559 --> 09:23.442
No, there was only sophomores, juniors, and seniors out there.

09:23.562 --> 09:24.042
Oh, okay, okay.

09:24.062 --> 09:24.883
They stayed behind.

09:25.083 --> 09:25.664
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:27.025 --> 09:31.489
But anyway, they would practice out there on the west side of Kyle Field.

09:31.739 --> 09:59.265
right next to us there were two practice fields there and some days we would finish before they did and I would love to stop and stand there and watch for a while there were some real athletes out there you know John David Crowe but the most interesting thing to watch was their wind sprints when they got through and

09:59.887 --> 10:04.353
They had this big old six-foot-two, 210-pound kid named Ken Hall.

10:06.056 --> 10:08.860
He looked like he had wings, and he wasn't even putting out any effort.

10:09.060 --> 10:11.824
He'd be 10 yards ahead of everybody on a 50-yard dance.

10:11.844 --> 10:12.805
From Sugar Land, Texas.

10:12.825 --> 10:14.027
From Sugar Land, Texas.

10:14.067 --> 10:16.951
The Sugar Land, what do they call him?

10:16.971 --> 10:18.433
The Sugar Land Express.

10:18.934 --> 10:22.359
He's out at Fredericksburg right now.

10:23.480 --> 10:24.602
It was amazing to watch him.

10:24.662 --> 10:28.307
I went to watch their first freshman football game, and on the first play of the game,

10:28.928 --> 10:33.794
He went 60 yards for a touchdown right out there in the north end of the cow field.

10:34.094 --> 10:44.125
And I've often thought, imagine what the backfield would have been like when they were seniors if you had a John David Crowe at fullback and a Hall at halfback.

10:45.206 --> 10:47.209
Yeah, but anyway, never.

10:48.070 --> 10:55.358
Now, about how many, so in summary of Junction, about how many went out 100 plus and about how many came back?

10:56.519 --> 10:57.200
30 some odd?

10:57.220 --> 10:58.622
Well, they claim that there's 35.

10:58.803 --> 11:00.285
So, so about a third.

11:00.305 --> 11:03.611
That's how many names are in the book.

11:03.631 --> 11:14.268
All right, when that fall, what, what did this, these changes in football, did they have any effect on you academically?

11:17.273 --> 11:23.083
Did you, you, the pressure of Coach Bryant and all,

11:25.645 --> 11:40.510
The only pressure was from the long time requirement with football while I was taking 20 hours coursework.

11:40.530 --> 11:46.941
That meant a lot of midnight oil burning for me to keep my grades up.

11:47.122 --> 11:49.105
In fact, that got me in trouble once.

11:49.878 --> 11:53.021
I think, I don't remember if they told about it in the book or not.

11:53.181 --> 11:56.865
Actually I have never finished reading The Junction Boys.

11:56.945 --> 11:59.908
It makes me feel pretty bad when I try to read it.

12:00.809 --> 12:08.436
But one night I told you that after practice you couldn't eat anything.

12:08.997 --> 12:12.120
You just drink and try to rehydrate yourself for two or three hours.

12:13.261 --> 12:17.085
I had to study that night and we lived, he moved us from Hart Hall to Walton Hall.

12:17.826 --> 12:19.007
We lived right up there at Northgate.

12:19.747 --> 12:41.496
and I had to study late so about 10, 30 or 11 I went over to Godfrey's restaurant there at Northgate, Jean Godfrey was a friend of all of us, she and her husband, and I had a cup of coffee and a piece of coconut pie.

12:41.516 --> 12:46.463
Went back to my room, sit down at my desk and was studying, somebody come knocking on the door in about 15 minutes.

12:47.489 --> 12:55.379
I went to the door and it is the man with the biggest, darkest scowl on his face you've ever seen.

12:55.499 --> 13:02.688
Hall, did I see you over at Godfrey's about 15 minutes ago?

13:02.748 --> 13:03.449
I said, yes, sir.

13:03.749 --> 13:04.951
What were you doing over there?

13:06.312 --> 13:08.715
I said I was having a piece of pie and a cup of coffee.

13:11.819 --> 13:14.863
He said, well, we're fixing to have a team meeting

13:15.957 --> 13:18.180
and you are not invited.

13:20.362 --> 13:20.663
Gone.

13:22.125 --> 13:22.445
Why?

13:24.127 --> 13:24.748
Why, Coach?

13:24.768 --> 13:26.850
What'd I do?

13:26.870 --> 13:31.536
Anyway, I don't hold any animosity toward Coach Bryant.

13:31.957 --> 13:33.018
I give him his dues.

13:35.201 --> 13:36.362
He proved himself

13:37.912 --> 13:46.043
to be capable of having the best football winning record of anybody in major college football.

13:47.525 --> 13:56.898
He proved himself to be a good enough mentor that many young people felt very close to him.

13:58.079 --> 14:01.905
And like Dennis Goering said, he felt like a second father to me.

14:03.587 --> 14:07.412
He proved himself to be an extremely capable

14:09.721 --> 14:19.031
Speaker, businessman, and probably a lousy father and husband, probably.

14:20.453 --> 14:21.694
I give him all his dues.

14:23.656 --> 14:36.951
He did it better than anybody else has ever done it, but I will never agree that the methods that he used in 1954 were right, was the right way to treat young men.

14:37.792 --> 14:39.053
Never will I agree with that.

14:39.607 --> 14:52.139
And I'll go a little further and say that when they had the 25th reunion at Junction, you may know this and you may not care one way or the other, Dennis Gehring called me and told me about it and said, Charlie, why don't you come out and go with us?

14:52.819 --> 14:54.261
I said, Dennis, I'm not going.

14:55.082 --> 15:02.248
And he pleaded with me, you know, and that's when he said, well, Charlie, my goodness, don't you have any respect for Coach Bryant?

15:03.049 --> 15:04.490
He's like a second father to me.

15:05.391 --> 15:06.272
I said, Dennis...

15:07.012 --> 15:09.094
I had a wonderful Christian father.

15:09.154 --> 15:13.519
I would never compare him with Coach Bryant, and I really sincerely feel that way.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.263
So I'm giving him his dues on both sides of the fence.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.828
During that senior year, you said you were married.

15:21.868 --> 15:23.790
Were you living off campus then?

15:23.810 --> 15:24.050
Oh, no.

15:24.230 --> 15:25.211
I lived in the dorm.

15:25.231 --> 15:25.532
In the dorm.

15:25.552 --> 15:27.514
My wife stayed in Dallas and worked.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.016
All right.

15:30.457 --> 15:36.023
When the season is over for you, you're through with athletics?

15:36.374 --> 15:37.335
at A&M.

15:37.556 --> 15:38.697
Yes sir.

15:39.999 --> 15:40.940
Through with academics.

15:42.222 --> 15:45.346
Oh you graduated that fall semester?

15:45.366 --> 15:46.988
I graduated that fall semester.

15:47.108 --> 15:50.172
All right and you're getting ready to go on active duty.

15:50.192 --> 15:50.753
Active duty.

15:51.414 --> 15:52.275
Right.

15:53.176 --> 15:58.603
During all those A&M years you've mentioned religion a few times.

15:58.623 --> 16:01.827
Did you go to any religious meetings here?

16:01.968 --> 16:02.989
Did you attend church?

16:03.982 --> 16:08.086
Rarely.

16:08.407 --> 16:08.767
Okay.

16:08.947 --> 16:09.368
Rarely.

16:10.189 --> 16:11.930
I was raised in the Methodist Church.

16:13.652 --> 16:13.853
Okay.

16:13.873 --> 16:32.132
When I was going to A&M I felt like that my upbringing had stood me well and kept me out of a lot of trouble but no I did not, I don't want to say I didn't have the opportunity

16:32.686 --> 16:35.168
I did not do it on a regular basis.

16:37.911 --> 16:40.173
Getting there and back even was a problem.

16:40.194 --> 16:44.898
They didn't have a chapel on campus at that time, but I probably would not have gone.

16:46.420 --> 16:53.367
But then again, outside of that I've always gone to church except when I was going to A&M.

16:56.029 --> 17:02.676
At Northgate, what was there at Northgate in those days, places where you and your friends could go if you wanted to?

17:04.293 --> 17:08.785
Well there were, the only thing at Northgate were a few restaurants.

17:09.246 --> 17:09.767
Such as?

17:10.590 --> 17:13.136
Well, Godfrey's.

17:14.781 --> 17:15.282
Where was it?

17:16.831 --> 17:22.176
Oh, between Chicken Oil Company and the corner drug store.

17:22.316 --> 17:26.020
The drug store, which is now Lupo's, that was a drug store.

17:26.620 --> 17:27.281
You could go there.

17:27.321 --> 17:32.005
And periodically the restaurants change names.

17:32.265 --> 17:36.629
The Campus Theater is where Shadow Canyon is now.

17:36.749 --> 17:38.671
Yeah, they all went to the campus.

17:38.691 --> 17:44.897
And they had the drive-in theater down at Triangle, down on the corner, the circle, circle drive-in theater.

17:46.447 --> 17:53.980
And did y'all, on the campus, did y'all ever go to Southgate to Maidleys?

17:55.723 --> 17:56.184
Rarely.

17:56.204 --> 17:58.387
All right, now that, I haven't heard many people mention that.

17:58.407 --> 17:58.828
Rarely.

17:59.790 --> 18:01.673
That wasn't the focus of attention.

18:01.713 --> 18:03.736
That's the impression I get.

18:04.458 --> 18:09.366
And now, for social life,

18:09.937 --> 18:16.886
What was it like to describe bringing a date to the campus for a big campus dance or party or something?

18:19.229 --> 18:32.766
Well, it was an ordeal that required an awful lot of planning because very few of us had vehicles, but we had to make some kind of arrangements for transportation to and from.

18:33.687 --> 18:39.555
So we generally try to pair up with friends that might be able to,

18:40.463 --> 18:42.024
borrow your car for a weekend.

18:42.045 --> 18:44.627
I never was able to borrow the vehicle.

18:45.588 --> 19:05.967
My parents lived in Dallas a four-hour trip away and they had one vehicle and that was it so we just have to make arrangements with our friends that were able to get some kind of transportation and make arrangements for them to stay in the motel and get to and from in a very short space of span of time.

19:07.228 --> 19:08.850
It was usually a Saturday

19:09.387 --> 19:11.149
night affair and that was about it.

19:12.491 --> 19:14.794
Do you remember when you bought your senior boots?

19:15.475 --> 19:17.297
I never bought senior boots.

19:17.397 --> 19:18.979
I did not own senior boots.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.701
So you didn't go to the boot dance?

19:22.964 --> 19:28.771
I went to the boot dance but I didn't wear boots because I didn't have any.

19:28.791 --> 19:29.372
Where was it?

19:29.933 --> 19:30.333
Sebesa?

19:30.353 --> 19:31.555
Sebesa, yes.

19:31.935 --> 19:34.298
Was there a big off-campus band?

19:37.687 --> 19:40.812
See, 10 years earlier they had the big name bands, but I don't think they were.

19:40.832 --> 19:42.154
Good question, but I don't remember.

19:42.174 --> 19:43.857
I don't think they were coming in the 50s.

19:44.158 --> 19:49.587
How were the women, how were the dates treated when they were here?

19:49.827 --> 19:50.528
Like Queens.

19:53.353 --> 19:58.000
I mean, that's the way with, that's the way it was in the 50s.

19:58.221 --> 20:00.825
The women were on pedestals and we looked up to them and,

20:01.379 --> 20:05.865
they were better than we were and we treated them like queens.

20:07.127 --> 20:18.483
And let's see did they have dance cards then where you signed who was dancing with whom or did you just dance with your date and occasionally somebody cut in?

20:20.686 --> 20:29.158
We did not have cards we almost exclusively danced with our dates maybe once

20:29.459 --> 20:32.982
or twice during the evening switch with friends who had dates.

20:33.563 --> 20:42.651
Now, for those of you that were on the football team, did y'all feel that you were fully a part of the student body, accepted by your fellow students?

20:43.352 --> 20:56.985
Yes, but I always felt, because I had lived in the Corps for a while, I felt that I didn't get as much of that as I would have enjoyed.

20:57.438 --> 20:59.421
I love the Corps to this very day.

20:59.461 --> 21:10.801
To me it is the best training that a young man can get and the camaraderie with it is just unbelievable.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.948
Lifelong friendships are developed there in a short period of time.

21:15.449 --> 21:18.995
Describe the basic attitudes of the student body then.

21:19.596 --> 21:20.357
Then?

21:25.636 --> 21:28.940
The basic attitude of the student body then was.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.383
Attitude, philosophy, whatever word you might want to use.

21:38.152 --> 21:40.495
Responsible dedication to the task at hand.

21:41.356 --> 21:45.441
We lived academics.

21:45.461 --> 21:48.945
We didn't have distractions to bother us.

21:50.767 --> 21:55.373
I mean that's what we were here for to get a good education and to

21:55.876 --> 21:56.958
develop friendships.

21:58.139 --> 22:06.050
I think that the attitude was the job is in front of us, let's do it together and let's enjoy it.

22:07.472 --> 22:11.678
And did it matter who your parents were or what their ancestry was?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.825
Zero difference, made no difference whatsoever, none.

22:17.146 --> 22:19.489
Can you recall some?

22:20.330 --> 22:20.531
Sure.

22:21.332 --> 22:23.114
Some students whose?

22:23.715 --> 22:25.798
We had a friend in Hart Hall.

22:26.993 --> 22:30.699
from Illinois.

22:30.739 --> 22:32.522
His father was a big manufacturer.

22:33.583 --> 22:40.254
He came to A&M in a brand-new Buick automobile, leather upholstery, the whole nine yards.

22:41.215 --> 22:42.117
Great guy.

22:43.038 --> 22:44.120
Love him to this day.

22:45.842 --> 22:52.613
When he had his car, he didn't keep his car here the whole time because I think he felt guilty.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.462
But he's a great guy.

22:55.743 --> 22:57.305
Don Niederer is his name.

22:57.685 --> 22:59.708
And he's been a big contributor to A&M.

22:59.929 --> 23:05.497
And you remember some Hispanics and some Catholics and some Jews?

23:05.537 --> 23:07.500
Was there a diversity in the student body?

23:07.901 --> 23:11.386
I don't remember many Jews.

23:13.869 --> 23:17.515
And there weren't many Hispanics.

23:18.376 --> 23:21.441
But were they accepted as a... No different.

23:22.182 --> 23:23.123
Why was that so?

23:23.643 --> 23:24.644
Why were they accepted?

23:24.664 --> 23:25.705
Why was everybody accepted?

23:27.788 --> 23:30.511
Because they were Aggies and that's the way Aggies treat each other.

23:32.573 --> 23:38.620
What, uh, what are the events that contribute most to that feeling?

23:39.681 --> 23:41.643
The events that contribute most to that feeling?

23:41.663 --> 23:42.063
The events.

23:42.724 --> 23:43.144
Events?

23:43.645 --> 23:45.307
Yeah, the plural.

23:45.327 --> 23:53.616
Um, there's no question in my mind but that muster is number one, silver taps is number two,

23:54.524 --> 24:04.139
Living in the Corps has to be a big plus factor for that.

24:06.844 --> 24:12.813
The traditions are a strong binding force between all Aggies.

24:19.243 --> 24:20.245
The alumni

24:21.760 --> 24:23.482
are a strong force in it.

24:23.842 --> 24:25.625
The faculty's a strong force in it.

24:26.165 --> 24:29.729
My goodness, it's one big family.

24:30.170 --> 24:33.874
Do you remember going to a Silver Taps that was particularly memorable to you?

24:41.363 --> 24:45.368
Well, not one, Haskell.

24:45.388 --> 24:49.793
I've lost lots of friends and I cried all of them.

24:52.135 --> 24:53.797
Do you remember your first muster?

24:55.219 --> 24:55.880
Do you remember when?

24:57.342 --> 24:59.245
Yes, but I don't remember who it was far.

25:00.527 --> 25:02.510
No, but I remember.

25:02.730 --> 25:04.132
Did you go to muster here on campus?

25:04.152 --> 25:08.158
Went to muster here on, oh did you say Silver Taps?

25:08.178 --> 25:09.740
Silver Taps was first and then muster.

25:10.722 --> 25:11.583
The first muster.

25:14.727 --> 25:16.590
You don't remember whether you went as a freshman or not?

25:19.118 --> 25:33.578
I don't remember if I did but I have always gone to musters even when I was not here in Palestine I went to the muster up there.

25:34.619 --> 25:37.483
I have spoken at musters.

25:37.503 --> 25:41.308
I'm doing my 25th muster speech this year in Charleston, South Carolina.

25:41.949 --> 25:42.830
Congratulations.

25:43.331 --> 25:47.877
It is, it's the number one, it's the,

25:48.194 --> 25:49.635
top event of the year for me.

25:49.716 --> 25:50.396
I wouldn't miss it.

25:51.698 --> 25:53.700
Uh, since, since you?

25:53.720 --> 25:56.983
Except my father died on mustard day in 96 and I missed it.

25:57.283 --> 25:57.724
Oh my.

25:58.665 --> 25:59.085
Uh.

25:59.125 --> 25:59.866
Not 96, 98.

26:00.467 --> 26:04.651
Did, when you were playing football, uh, did y'all go to yell practice?

26:04.671 --> 26:06.333
Did the, did the team go to yell practice?

26:07.134 --> 26:08.115
Uh, sometimes, yes.

26:08.875 --> 26:09.716
Now I've heard also.

26:09.736 --> 26:10.197
At the Grove.

26:10.777 --> 26:17.104
I've heard that sometimes there were spontaneous yell practices held at Coach Bryant's

26:17.827 --> 26:20.310
request during the season?

26:20.790 --> 26:21.611
Not during 54.

26:21.792 --> 26:23.894
Oh okay, okay.

26:23.914 --> 26:26.137
Maybe so.

26:27.378 --> 26:29.761
Remember Coach Bryant was a different man after 1954.

26:29.781 --> 26:35.368
He showed a little the human side after 1954.

26:35.668 --> 26:41.154
Your senior ring, do you remember when you went over to get it?

26:42.095 --> 26:43.157
Have any idea what it cost?

26:44.358 --> 26:45.960
My recollection is thirty dollars.

26:47.003 --> 26:49.587
And how did you feel when you put it on?

26:50.428 --> 26:50.808
Great.

26:53.372 --> 26:57.598
And when I lost it, I'd like to have a heart attack.

26:57.618 --> 26:58.619
Where did you lose it?

26:59.100 --> 27:00.362
Elizabethtown, Kentucky.

27:01.283 --> 27:12.218
That summer when I went up to summer camp at Fort Knox on the way back, we stopped at Elizabethtown to go to the bathroom

27:12.940 --> 27:17.905
I took my ring off to wash my hands get the soap off my finger and walked out of there without it.

27:19.627 --> 27:28.996
Got in the car and we drove down the road a few miles and all of a sudden I noticed it was missing and by the way I don't wear it anymore for a reason.

27:29.917 --> 27:35.783
I hollered I said my ring my ring it's in that John back at that filling station.

27:36.825 --> 27:41.209
We whipped around and drove back down there and I ran in there and it was gone.

27:42.455 --> 27:49.265
I went in to the owner and I said I left my ring in there do you have any idea you know has there been anybody in there and he said yeah.

27:49.285 --> 28:07.230
He said there were some men that walked from over yonder walked over here went into the restroom and were in there a little bit and left and went back they must work over yonder somewhere and

28:08.695 --> 28:12.440
He said forget about finding it if they found it because you ain't going to ever find it again.

28:13.902 --> 28:37.453
Went on home and when I was in vet school I came in 1960 sometime during 1961 I got a note from— Wirus, Buck Wirus?

28:38.108 --> 28:40.270
I forget who it was from now.

28:40.290 --> 28:54.607
It says, so and so has found your Aggie ring and her address is such and such.

28:57.630 --> 29:07.862
Anyway, I wrote her a letter, the lady, and thanked her profusely and put a five dollar bill in there and in a week or ten days

29:08.821 --> 29:11.425
I got the ring and the five dollars back she sent back.

29:11.465 --> 29:19.836
She sent a nice letter and said that her husband had gone into that restroom and saw it laying there and picked it up and she apologized.

29:20.116 --> 29:31.792
It was nearly five years later and said that we've had a lot of illness and whatever in the family and the husband was dead and she apologized but I got the ring back.

29:32.433 --> 29:33.374
Oh, that's marvelous.

29:33.614 --> 29:35.457
I was asked for good ring stories.

29:37.019 --> 29:38.541
That's a wonderful ring story.

29:38.588 --> 29:50.999
Well, Ray Bowen told me that while he was doing his master's degree at Caltech in Europe with two German fellow graduate students, they're riding the train to Venice.

29:51.500 --> 29:56.945
They're in the Alps, and here's this lady, well-dressed, neat, pleasant, reading the paper.

29:57.666 --> 29:59.067
And she's reading an English paper.

30:00.128 --> 30:03.091
And she looks over at him and said, oh, did you go to A&M?

30:03.191 --> 30:03.751
Well, yes, ma'am.

30:03.771 --> 30:04.552
How did you know?

30:04.572 --> 30:05.693
Well, I saw your ring.

30:06.466 --> 30:08.128
And, what's your name?

30:08.168 --> 30:09.190
And he said, Ray Bowen.

30:09.911 --> 30:11.974
And she said, well, I'm from San Antonio.

30:12.054 --> 30:13.636
You might have heard of my husband.

30:13.696 --> 30:14.597
His name is H.B.

30:14.698 --> 30:15.018
Zachary.

30:15.899 --> 30:17.802
Oh, might have.

30:18.202 --> 30:23.610
And he said he told her, yes, ma'am, I think I have heard of him.

30:24.331 --> 30:29.999
All right, so you graduated then at mid in January.

30:30.099 --> 30:30.640
January 51.

30:31.521 --> 30:34.245
And were we having commencements then?

30:34.934 --> 30:35.655
In January?

30:36.917 --> 30:37.117
Mm-hmm.

30:37.137 --> 30:37.377
Okay.

30:37.538 --> 30:42.465
And they had a military ceremony.

30:42.485 --> 30:43.406
I forget what they called that.

30:43.426 --> 30:44.067
The commissioning?

30:44.087 --> 30:44.708
Commissioning ceremony.

30:44.728 --> 30:46.250
But there was not a final review?

30:46.630 --> 30:46.831
No.

30:47.111 --> 30:48.473
Okay.

30:48.653 --> 30:50.055
Describe commencement for you.

30:50.135 --> 30:52.479
Who came and what was it like and how did you feel?

30:52.719 --> 30:58.567
Oh, my parents came, my brothers came, all the family came.

30:58.627 --> 31:01.431
I was the first one in my family.

31:03.166 --> 31:04.327
And I felt proud.

31:06.790 --> 31:10.133
My older brother says, you shouldn't use that word, proud, Gary.

31:10.754 --> 31:17.520
I said, well, I won't use it if you'll just let me use it to say that I'm proud to be an American, proud to be a Texan, and proud to be an Aggie.

31:18.582 --> 31:22.506
I won't use it anywhere else.

31:22.526 --> 31:29.933
And how well prepared did you think A&M had made you for the real world?

31:37.456 --> 31:45.103
A&M prepared me beautifully for a career in agriculture.
