WEBVTT

00:05.735 --> 00:16.329
And they say that the most difficult problem on 
Kennedy's desk was, where shall the next

00:05.735 --> 00:16.329
cyclotron go?

00:19.173 --> 00:27.024
Well, you know what happened in November of 63 in 
Dallas? And Mr. Johnson became president as a

00:28.946 --> 00:33.092
consequence of that.

00:37.814 --> 00:45.306
I recall at that time reading an article in the 
journal Science. I've forgotten the author. I

00:49.072 --> 00:50.254
want to say David. It

00:50.274 --> 00:55.402
escapes me. It was entitled, When Pure Science 
Meets Pure Politics. And it was telling the story

01:02.474 --> 01:04.497
of The machinations going on about where shall the 
next cyclotron go?

01:12.877 --> 01:31.176
Well, Earl Rudder's association with Lyndon 
Johnson was clearly far and away the thing that

01:12.877 --> 01:31.176
turned that tide and got the cyclotron allocated 
to Texas A&M University. Okay, but your question

01:33.164 --> 01:38.449
had to do with women and minorities. Let's stay 
with that just a second. Can you think of any other

01:40.011 --> 01:48.979
Rudder-Johnson relationships that brought some 
special blessing to A&M?

01:54.504 --> 01:56.646
Not quickly offhand, no, Haskell. But that 
cyclotron was a big one.

02:02.965 --> 02:19.202
Let's see, then while we're on new programs, how 
did chemistry and economics come to be

02:02.965 --> 02:19.202
highlighted for

02:02.965 --> 02:19.202
great strengthening?

02:24.177 --> 02:35.782
And I think chemistry came to be selected as a 
spotlight

02:24.177 --> 02:35.782
center because of the Welch Foundation and W.T. 
Doherty's interest in chemistry.

02:50.722 --> 03:03.702
Economics became selected as a program to be taken 
to national

02:50.722 --> 03:03.702
visibility. I think mainly because of its already 
established recognition across the country as a

03:05.588 --> 03:21.667
good solid source of masters people who are quite 
capable at the doctoral level. Al Chalk, head of

03:22.849 --> 03:33.081
the department,

03:22.849 --> 03:33.081
insisted upon all things on good teaching, 
outstanding teaching, and selective

03:34.850 --> 03:42.401
recruitment of top students for the economics 
department. And the young people that graduated

03:44.284 --> 04:01.650
with a degree in economics who wanted to go on and do 
graduate work were sought after, in fact, by the

03:44.284 --> 04:01.650
graduate schools across the country. At that 
time, we did not have a doctorate in economics

04:02.845 --> 04:12.638
ourselves, and that didn't come until after Mel 
Greenhut got here. Now, was that after liberal

04:13.359 --> 04:21.630
arts was split away from education, or was that 
under your days?

04:24.007 --> 04:26.271
Did you hire Greenhut or was that later? Yeah, I 
hired Greenhut. I say I hired. Al Chalk selected

04:29.115 --> 04:31.679
him, brought him in. We employed him, yes. And

04:34.884 --> 04:48.225
Greenhut immediately,

04:34.884 --> 04:48.225
on the good solid base in economics that he found, 
immediately designated that this department's

04:49.403 --> 04:59.453
strength at the doctoral level shall be built 
toward econometrics, quantitative economics.

05:01.134 --> 05:17.470
He said that's clearly the way the discipline is 
going and that he intended to recruit top people

05:01.134 --> 05:17.470
who were of that

05:01.134 --> 05:17.470
ilk. Green Hut came from Florida, as I recall. 
Florida State. Florida State. Florida State,

05:26.474 --> 05:27.735
okay.

05:32.801 --> 05:33.462
Let's see.

05:38.749 --> 05:47.299
Do you remember any pioneer women, outstanding 
female students that were precedent makers or

05:38.749 --> 05:47.299
setters? No, I don't, Haskell. Or any black 
student leaders before Fred McClure. I don't

05:52.344 --> 05:52.925
know. No, he was the top one then and in my mind is 
still now. I agree. Go back and trace, if you can,

06:02.598 --> 06:18.760
when Arts and Sciences was broken up and weren't 
there a number of steps going from Arts and

06:02.598 --> 06:18.760
Sciences to the five different colleges there? 
that exists now.

06:23.995 --> 06:32.088
By a number of steps you mean the procedural 
mechanism by which colleges are separated and

06:23.995 --> 06:32.088
established? No, it didn't go from arts and 
sciences all at once, did it, to education,

06:32.108 --> 06:37.938
business? Oh no, oh no. Well, that's what I... The 
first change in organization was a separation of

06:42.854 --> 06:49.167
science and the others. And the others came to be 
called the liberal arts.

06:56.362 --> 07:03.377
And that took place

06:56.362 --> 07:03.377
late spring of 1965.

07:14.292 --> 07:15.093
Let's see.

07:21.061 --> 07:21.482
Oh, yes.

07:26.849 --> 07:37.504
In 1965, the spring enrollment data, spring 
semester enrollment for 1965.

07:38.125 --> 07:44.113
Oh, I see

07:38.125 --> 07:44.113
what I've done. showed that the College of Arts and 
Sciences had become for the first time the largest

07:45.764 --> 08:08.406
college at the university, not only in terms of 
semester credit hours produced and size of

07:45.764 --> 08:08.406
faculty, but in numbers of students registered 
for degree purposes in that college. Larger than

08:08.426 --> 08:09.768
engineering? My God. Larger than agriculture? It 
can't be. And of course, vet medicine was a small

08:14.823 --> 08:17.467
enrollment. Boy, I think that was a catalyst which 
quickly brought the division of science from the

08:18.930 --> 08:31.750
liberal arts. Plus one other feature.

08:38.961 --> 08:42.467
By that time, I had an associate dean in science. He 
had come from Rice University, was a

08:43.358 --> 08:54.230
distinguished scientist in the field of 
cryogenics, low temperature physics, whose name

08:43.358 --> 08:54.230
was Charles Squire. Charles was a leading

08:55.812 --> 09:05.542
researcher supported by Welch funds. And this 
again, I think, was the influence of W.T.

09:16.096 --> 09:21.022
You need a scientist up there to help dean the 
sciences. So

09:22.864 --> 09:40.446
I was advised one day that I needed an associate 
dean in science, and that

09:22.864 --> 09:40.446
come go with me. This is President Rutter. Let's go 
down to Rice and visit a guy in his laboratory and

09:42.623 --> 09:50.298
see what you think of him." President Rudder and I 
took a trip to Rice, did spend a couple of hours in

09:50.318 --> 10:03.282
Charles Squire's laboratory,

09:50.318 --> 10:03.282
got acquainted with him, very interesting.

10:06.029 --> 10:11.896
He came back, Frank, what would you think about 
having him as an associate dean for science? Fine,

10:11.916 --> 10:13.237
okay, good.

10:15.980 --> 10:18.102
No need to get rattled over such an item.

10:26.592 --> 10:33.960
At the same time, there had been selected a new vice 
president for research at about this time, One,

10:34.143 --> 10:36.465
Dr. Andrew Suttles. And he had come from a 
commercial laboratory, I want to say one of the

10:38.808 --> 10:55.564
petrochemical people's laboratories, I've 
forgotten which, Exxon or Texaco or somebody like

10:38.808 --> 10:55.564
that. Who identified him, do you know? I'm sure it 
was W.T. Daugherty, without any question.

11:06.037 --> 11:09.301
and Earl, you need a vice president for research. 
Maybe not in that language, but

11:11.644 --> 11:18.451
he was selected for that position.

11:24.258 --> 11:33.529
Well, the coming of, I think they had been selected 
by this time, but by, It was clear that science

11:35.551 --> 11:49.970
wanted to bask in its own sunlight and didn't want 
to be burdened

11:35.551 --> 11:49.970
with association with the liberal arts. Think how 
much faster we can grow and what greater things we

11:49.990 --> 11:57.860
can do in science if we have our own identity, etc. 
When the enrollment figures in the spring of 65

12:03.293 --> 12:06.157
came in, that was a clincher.

12:09.200 --> 12:22.077
Let's divide science out of liberal arts, out of 
arts and sciences, and that way they will no longer

12:09.200 --> 12:22.077
be the largest college on campus. That's my 
conjecture, Haskell. No one ever told me that, but

12:25.301 --> 12:30.347
it was relatively Maybe it was just coincidence, 
happened at the same time, but I thought it had some

12:31.643 --> 12:40.388
effect.

12:47.202 --> 13:15.758
let's see your question then after science uh... 
was created after science and liberal arts were

12:47.202 --> 13:15.758
divided then geosciences quickly followed the 
following year and the creation of a college of

12:47.202 --> 13:15.758
geoscience and that made sense mainly because of 
oceanography and meteorology which were in

12:47.202 --> 13:15.758
science

13:17.172 --> 13:39.838
Had the largest sum of research going on in the 
university anywhere, I think at one time, and I'm

13:17.172 --> 13:39.838
not sure just when the date was, but at one time, the 
research volume in dollars going on in the

13:17.172 --> 13:39.838
Department of Oceanography and Meteorology, the 
aggregate was larger than all other research done

13:17.172 --> 13:39.838
on the campus. And that brought also geology, what 
we now call geology and geophysics. Geology and

13:46.508 --> 13:49.692
geophysics out of engineering. And geography out 
of liberal arts. And

13:55.258 --> 14:01.044
oceanography and meteorology well out of 
science.

14:03.847 --> 14:10.635
Now then, at that time, science

14:03.847 --> 14:10.635
was so much on the move

14:13.535 --> 14:26.007
And

14:13.535 --> 14:26.007
resources were being allocated to science that 
even A&M wasn't accustomed to.

14:30.311 --> 14:37.958
President Rutter wanted members of the National 
Academy of Science to give our program better

14:30.311 --> 14:37.958
visibility. We didn't have any at the time.

14:43.555 --> 15:04.834
with the opportunity to employ a college, a dean of 
science, and a dean of geosciences the following

14:43.555 --> 15:04.834
year, he dedicated himself to a recruitment 
program that would be beamed at members of the

14:43.555 --> 15:04.834
academy. And that's when Zener came aboard and 
Bowers from Chicago and from Pittsburgh.

15:16.225 --> 15:18.328
Both top flight guys.

15:25.757 --> 15:40.577
At this time then, what was left with the College of 
Liberal Arts, business and education, were they

15:25.757 --> 15:40.577
still called departments? No, education was a 
department, but business was and had always been a

15:46.229 --> 15:48.251
division.

15:55.799 --> 16:01.485
Business administration was next to be separated 
out as a college. And I forget the year. It was after

16:03.406 --> 16:11.815
65 and after, I want to say after 66, probably 
either 67 or eight. And next, education was

16:12.993 --> 16:16.017
separated out.

16:19.762 --> 16:40.570
I had an offer from the University of Texas in the 
fall of 1968 to

16:19.762 --> 16:40.570
return over there as a fully tenured, full 
professor and head of department of the

16:41.123 --> 17:09.223
department from which i'd gotten my degree

16:41.123 --> 17:09.223
and uh norman hackerman then president of ut 
called earl rutter and said earl we want to see if we

16:41.123 --> 17:09.223
can get frank hubert over here to do this job for us

16:41.123 --> 17:09.223
earl called me over and said frank i know they're 
talking with you I just want to ask you one thing,

17:09.575 --> 17:17.927
and that is, if you will, before you make a final 
decision on this, come sit down and talk with me.

17:21.272 --> 17:21.893
I went over. The job was offered to me firm, with 
tenure, the professorship, et cetera, and a

17:21.933 --> 17:35.734
salary that exceeded my dean's salary at A&M.

17:39.038 --> 17:47.012
I went back and talked to Mary Julia, and we were 
uncertain as to what we wanted to do, really

17:39.038 --> 17:47.012
uncertain. I was torn between the two. Austin is so 
attractive, as is the University of Texas.

18:03.760 --> 18:09.088
got an appointment with President Rutter, went in 
and sat down with him and told him the details.

18:12.113 --> 18:21.628
And he said, well, Frank, if you want to return to 
education, isn't it time that we created a college

18:12.113 --> 18:21.628
of education here?

18:24.553 --> 18:30.122
We'll create a college of education here and you 
can dean it if you want to.

18:34.253 --> 18:41.160
I said, well, that's an inviting idea. He says, 
well, I'll tell you what you do. Bring me a short

18:45.464 --> 18:56.935
summary of what we need to do, the changes we need to 
make, and what it'll cost us to get a college of

18:45.464 --> 18:56.935
education going started.

19:00.158 --> 19:01.780
Well, that evening, I went home. sat down at my 
desk, wrote out a two-page summary of the

19:02.182 --> 19:18.537
organizational nature and the additional 
personnel required and what it would cost, and the

19:02.182 --> 19:18.537
identity of the departments.

19:23.842 --> 19:25.343
Took it back in the next day. He said, I'm going to 
call the members of the Executive Committee of the

19:25.383 --> 19:30.788
Regents. and place this before them and see if we 
can't get quick action on it. He did, and within

19:38.563 --> 19:48.136
another day, he called me in and said, Frank, the 
deanship of the new College of Education is yours

19:38.563 --> 19:48.136
if you want it.

19:51.621 --> 19:59.712
And he says, we'll equal the salary that they 
offered you at UT.

20:00.738 --> 20:02.540
I took that home to Mary Julian. We agreed to accept 
it and did. I

20:04.463 --> 20:13.775
don't know how it happened, but that was very early 
in 69.

20:18.761 --> 20:30.576
President Rudder said, write the coordinating 
board proposal for the new college, as I had done

20:18.761 --> 20:30.576
for liberal arts and participated in the others. 
He said, we'll get it moving. I had it on his desk by

20:34.819 --> 20:43.487
the end of the week, the proposal for the new 
college and its organization and so forth.

20:48.492 --> 20:59.702
Ordinarily, a proposal for a new college would 
usually take anywhere from 12

20:48.492 --> 20:59.702
months to 18, minimum. for it to go through all of 
the spots on the obstacle course. But this one, it

21:06.713 --> 21:10.119
just seemed to set records. It hit the calendar 
exactly right all along the way. And by that

21:14.786 --> 21:25.684
following September, nine months later, we were 
authorized as a college with degrees, et cetera,

21:14.786 --> 21:25.684
et cetera, et cetera. Including the doctoral? 
Pardon? Including the doctoral degrees? No. Oh,

21:30.444 --> 21:31.105
not yet. We had to submit them separately to 
Haskell. And we did so later on.

21:42.559 --> 21:45.843
Then business... Business had already gone. 
Education was the last to go. Right. How was John

21:49.668 --> 21:53.533
Pearson selected as the Dean of Business?

21:56.973 --> 22:02.619
I did a search, got recommendations from a number 
of places. Let me see.

22:07.964 --> 22:11.627
I have forgotten where John Pearson's name came 
from. I think he was at North Texas. He was at North

22:15.311 --> 22:16.532
Texas. I'm aware of that. But I don't recall how his 
name got into focus. I didn't know him or know of

22:24.462 --> 22:30.770
him, but it was recommended to my office.

22:33.994 --> 22:34.615
From whom? By whom? Oh, my. Nonetheless, he turned 
out to be the guy and was finally selected as dean of

22:41.103 --> 22:50.014
that new college.

22:55.057 --> 23:14.972
I also had invited to participate in that 
selection a champ whom I had met in Wilmington,

22:55.057 --> 23:14.972
Delaware, while on a two-day visit to the EI 
DuPont, the Nemours Company. with a group of other

23:17.180 --> 23:35.081
people from the soft sciences

23:17.180 --> 23:35.081
who was then associate

23:17.180 --> 23:35.081
dean of business at Notre Dame, a sparkling 
fellow. But he turned the opportunity down. He

23:42.769 --> 23:46.714
said, I've got too much ahead of me here. Pearson 
was ultimately selected to become dean, and I

23:48.247 --> 23:57.057
don't recall where his name came from. Fooey. 
Okay. Right. As you then created the college, how

24:00.301 --> 24:12.155
did you identify the key people to take over the 
various units in the College of Education and your

24:00.301 --> 24:12.155
staff? Well, in the College of Education, it was 
relatively easy. The year before the College of

24:18.385 --> 24:26.779
Education was authorized, we had a vacancy in the 
headship of the Department of Education. This is

24:27.039 --> 24:28.862
fall of 68. Paul Henseling had a voice problem. 
Difficulty in talking and being understood.

24:43.066 --> 24:44.308
He asked to be

24:47.630 --> 24:50.333
I returned to a professorship.

24:55.237 --> 24:58.360
It was late in the summer of 68. I

24:58.480 --> 25:16.017
did not want to conduct a search for a new 
department head at that late date, so I took it upon

24:58.480 --> 25:16.017
myself to occupy the two positions. during that 
year, 68, 69, dean of liberal arts and head of the

25:16.385 --> 25:22.914
Department of Education.

25:30.165 --> 25:42.342
I hope your transcriber will be aware

25:30.165 --> 25:42.342
that these costs are necessary, and I apologize to 
her or him for it. Now, as

25:46.217 --> 26:05.882
head of the Department of Education, I got a 
firsthand acquaintance with the people in

25:46.217 --> 26:05.882
education in their various fields and made the 
selections for their appointments on that basis.

26:05.902 --> 26:10.067
I've heard also that the interim department head 
sometimes wrote recommendations that the dean

26:10.469 --> 26:16.015
turned down during that period. Yes. Really. I 
felt it obligatory as head of the department to

26:18.838 --> 26:25.426
make requests which I thought were justified, and 
I did. And when I reviewed them from the dean's

26:25.446 --> 26:38.400
office, I looked at them in terms of the overall 
breadth and scope of the college at that time, and I

26:25.446 --> 26:38.400
said, Yes, they need it, but we don't have the funds 
for it, and so forth. Now,

26:45.507 --> 26:51.332
so we got off. Well, we had some good people to start 
with.

26:56.677 --> 27:07.527
Glenn Johnson, doctorate from Teachers College, 
Columbia.

27:07.810 --> 27:10.414
Who was first head of Ed administration? Les 
Richardson? I don't know. Finally got Hal

27:16.022 --> 27:19.468
Hawkins, doctorate from Harvard. Ed Psychology, 
Art Roach, doctorate from Notre Dame.

27:31.326 --> 27:36.113
Jim Boone from here at A&M, and his doctorate was 
here at A&M, I believe.

27:40.126 --> 27:47.238
But we had some good people to start out with, and 
they were hard workers. As this is being finished,

27:47.258 --> 27:53.629
we now know that Mr. Rutter's health was 
declining. When did you become aware, you think,

27:54.852 --> 28:00.261
as you look back, that Mr. Rutter's health was 
being impaired?

28:08.054 --> 28:12.701
I don't recall specifically Haskell, a specific 
moment in time. But do you remember sometimes

28:12.821 --> 28:18.209
being with him, realizing that his energy wasn't 
what it had been? I think so, and it showed up at the

28:18.229 --> 28:27.302
executive committee meetings more than any place 
else. He just didn't have the go and punch that he

28:28.304 --> 28:32.230
had. And...

28:36.421 --> 28:51.816
But he was keeping pace with the fast-moving 
events on campus, sometimes not only keeping up

28:36.421 --> 28:51.816
with them, but out there in front pulling them 
along. He was also traveling. You can't imagine

28:54.859 --> 28:59.343
the travels that he took. I think he responded to 
every request made of him to make a speech

28:59.363 --> 29:04.588
anywhere. Whatever the subject so long as it 
related to Texas A&M University. Who were his key

29:11.480 --> 29:14.886
contacts in Austin and Washington? The 
individuals that he knew best that really helped

29:16.708 --> 29:20.775
A&M a lot.

29:26.503 --> 29:33.394
Tiger Teague in Washington, plus later LBJ 
himself.

29:39.247 --> 29:40.088
Let's see. John Connolly? Yes, John Connolly.

29:51.138 --> 29:55.842
Bill Moore, of course, although he was not in 
Austin, he was of Austin in a way.

30:00.126 --> 30:02.068
Who was Speaker of the House at that time?

30:05.912 --> 30:06.452
I don't know. I don't recall either, but I think 
that was a good relationship for A&M. And was

30:12.787 --> 30:17.433
Heatley one of Mr. Rutter's close contacts? I 
don't recall. As chairman of whatever it was, Ways

30:18.495 --> 30:22.920
and Means or Appropriations? I don't think he was a 
great friend, as I recall. And Senator Aiken? I

30:29.389 --> 30:29.850
don't know. I just don't know about Aiken. During 
the Rutter years, who was the key A&M person to work

30:32.673 --> 30:38.121
with the coordinating board?

30:42.468 --> 30:44.250
His vice president, I think. Right, the chief, 
what we now call the provost, vice president of

30:45.032 --> 30:49.358
academic affairs. Yes. When you first, do you 
recall any event, any circumstance under which

30:51.942 --> 31:00.655
you heard Mr. Rutter had been hospitalized? How 
did you all hear about it? How did you all know that

31:05.018 --> 31:10.526
he was seriously ill?

31:10.546 --> 31:13.249
I don't recall when or how that message came. It's 
not clear in my memory when it came. I remember

31:19.618 --> 31:30.793
hearing that after he was hospitalized, shortly 
after he was hospitalized, he was rushed to

31:19.618 --> 31:30.793
surgery. And he had to be taken in a subterranean

31:32.765 --> 31:44.583
channel from one building to another. And it was 
quite

31:46.205 --> 31:59.025
a group there moving along with him. This was in 
Houston. This is in Houston, yes. Let's see. His

32:07.915 --> 32:12.423
surgeon was, who's the guy? It wasn't DeBakey. It 
was,

32:15.809 --> 32:20.237
do you recall? The other top guy. There are two down 
there. The name is easy to recall. Denton Cooley. I

32:32.784 --> 32:35.808
think he did the surgery.

32:39.394 --> 32:43.640
It was just a shock when we heard of his death. An 
absolute shock. Do you remember the memorial

32:47.538 --> 32:49.620
service? Yes, very moving. I remember his

32:53.705 --> 33:02.294
being laid in state in the rotunda of the 
administration building.

33:08.901 --> 33:12.685
Ludeke was named interim.

33:16.428 --> 33:24.441
the board began its search for a new president of 
the system and the university. Called in, I think,

33:25.863 --> 33:27.907
each of the deans. I know I was called to express my 
views about those that they were examining.

33:35.619 --> 33:35.980
Really? Oh, good. Didn't know that. How 
appropriate were their questions? Very good

33:42.991 --> 33:45.536
questions. Excellent questions. Among the board 
members, who seemed to be the key movers and

33:48.742 --> 33:53.792
shakers at that point?

33:57.907 --> 34:07.479
Haskell, hard to recall, I remember that Ford 
Allbritton was active in the search for the new

33:57.907 --> 34:07.479
president.

34:10.703 --> 34:17.030
I also had heard prior to my going for the interview 
that Jack Williams was being considered.

34:19.673 --> 34:23.458
And my comment to the board was, you need look no 
further. If you can get this man to come back to

34:25.328 --> 34:33.599
Texas, you will have indeed pulled off a great coup 
for this university. Do you know who it was that

34:34.059 --> 34:38.365
originally suggested his name to them? No. You? 
Earl Rudder told Fort Albritton and John Lindsay a

34:39.606 --> 34:48.518
year and a half earlier in response to their 
question, Earl, God help us if it were to happen,

34:49.021 --> 34:55.952
but what should we do if anything ever happened to 
you? Do you have somebody on site? And Mr.

34:59.678 --> 35:03.204
Albritton said that Mr. Rutter said, no, I don't, 
and it's my fault. I ought to, but I don't. Well,

35:05.167 --> 35:06.129
what do we do if? Well, if you do... And he said that 
this was an hour or two later that he said, I've been

35:07.837 --> 35:11.843
thinking about it since then. And you go up there 
because his coordinating board experience, his

35:12.564 --> 35:25.482
knowledge of Texas, and his experience at Clemson 
and with the Southern Association has been so

35:12.564 --> 35:25.482
extensive. And Ford said, well, if that's what 
Earl thought, the board was very... Do you... Each

35:35.866 --> 35:37.590
of the deans were called in. Do you remember 
anybody else that they... I don't know that... I

35:42.942 --> 35:45.287
didn't hear from other deans that they were called 
in. I'm assuming that they were, Haskell. But I

35:48.153 --> 35:53.385
don't know of anyone else who might have been 
endorsed by... A dean or other deans. As far as you

35:56.572 --> 36:03.742
know, did Dr. Williams come to the campus for a 
pre-selection interview visit? That I do not

36:03.762 --> 36:04.823
know. I don't think he did. I don't know. How did you 
learn that he had been selected? I think by the

36:14.296 --> 36:15.418
media.

36:18.722 --> 36:23.068
And what was the first impression that you and 
others had of Dr. Williams as president? Great

36:26.416 --> 36:30.061
excitement.

36:30.081 --> 36:40.115
Just extremely happy that he would be willing to 
come to A&M and take the leadership role here that

36:30.081 --> 36:40.115
he did. Give some examples of some of his early 
decisions, early successes.

37:02.215 --> 37:03.758
Haskell, it's hard to say. He was so active on so 
many fronts. I know that during the interim period

37:10.852 --> 37:18.688
with Ludeke there, Lude began

37:21.031 --> 37:32.388
involving students more in some of the basic 
exercises and decisions than had ever been done

37:21.031 --> 37:32.388
before. When President Williams came, he picked 
that up and took it on to higher levels.

37:45.006 --> 37:50.194
President Williams also

37:45.006 --> 37:50.194
sought

37:53.937 --> 38:07.474
advice from faculty groups and individuals

37:53.937 --> 38:07.474
at an unprecedented pace, I think.

38:13.521 --> 38:19.328
Can you think of any skills that a university CEO 
needed that Jack Williams didn't have?

38:22.432 --> 38:23.353
He was a good speaker. good experience, 
energetic, student, faculty, sensitive, and so

38:24.143 --> 38:30.631
forth? He had it all, Haskell.

38:36.478 --> 38:38.200
Click that off just a minute. Okay. One of Dr. 
Williams' key appointments was John Calhoun as

38:40.063 --> 38:45.049
vice president. Yes. Describe him as the chief 
academic officer and his relationship with you

38:45.890 --> 38:53.239
and your dean colleagues. Yeah. I didn't know John 
very well prior to his appointment as the academic

38:55.710 --> 39:03.141
vice president. After he was appointed, there

39:04.323 --> 39:13.717
was no special relationship between the two of us. 
I responded in

39:15.480 --> 39:22.450
the usual way to all of the normal request for the 
flow of information up to that office.

39:31.787 --> 39:52.032
I remember one occasion when Dr.

39:31.787 --> 39:52.032
Calhoun, I

39:31.787 --> 39:52.032
think, how to say this, challenged a decision i had 
made in a way it was a student matter and a young lady

39:53.750 --> 40:16.011
in

39:53.750 --> 40:16.011
the college of liberal arts had come to me asking if 
she could take 21 hours of work in a single semester

39:53.750 --> 40:16.011
i looked at her record and i said no

40:19.805 --> 40:48.141
she asked if there was someone else she could see 
about this and i said yes if you want to question my

40:19.805 --> 40:48.141
decision you can go see the vice president for 
academic matters she did john called me over and i

40:19.805 --> 40:48.141
think john was tempted to support the young lady i 
said john i just can't go with it and he sustained me

40:19.805 --> 40:48.141
but i have the feeling that If it had been himself 
alone, he would have ruled otherwise. That may

40:55.432 --> 40:58.136
have been an error on my part. That's the only time I 
remember a

40:58.977 --> 41:08.131
question about a decision I had made. Other than 
that, I think our relationships were quite

41:08.932 --> 41:13.639
friendly all along the way, Haskell. The 
enrollment was zooming upward because Dr.

41:14.547 --> 41:28.293
Williams had made it a condition of his acceptance 
of the offer that an existing dormitory be

41:14.547 --> 41:28.293
identified for women in January of 1971. He begins 
in the fall of 70. And there had been no housing on

41:33.863 --> 41:36.268
campus for women. How did that zoom in enrollment, 
how did that affect you and your colleagues? Well,

41:44.328 --> 41:47.812
in the College of Education, of course, it was a 
great boon.

41:50.535 --> 42:01.227
The women's opportunity for positions other than 
in teaching had not yet developed to the point

41:50.535 --> 42:01.227
where they were a strong magnet. for women to go to 
engineering, to go to business especially, and to

42:02.135 --> 42:08.383
other colleges. If you were a woman, you

42:10.505 --> 42:17.534
trained to be a teacher.

42:20.237 --> 42:25.223
And as a consequence, the College of Education 
experienced a big, big increase in enrollment

42:26.485 --> 42:39.550
very rapidly, quickly.

42:47.647 --> 42:55.277
Do you remember any incidents that the increase in 
women caused? I don't remember any problems. The

42:57.981 --> 42:59.263
only problem was space. Right, for classes and 
faculty and staff, but I don't remember any

42:59.303 --> 43:07.354
student resentment or antagonism. No, no. Let's 
see. Dr. Williams then was the president of the

43:13.246 --> 43:24.323
system and of the institution as Mr. Rutter had 
been. Yes. What were the benefits or the handicaps

43:25.645 --> 43:29.651
of that arrangement? Well, the handicaps were one 
of

43:31.193 --> 43:38.244
time, I think. I...

43:43.351 --> 43:47.296
The demands upon the president of the university 
are so extensive.

43:49.739 --> 44:03.216
And the demands upon the

43:49.739 --> 44:03.216
president, or now chancellor of the system, are 
again extensive. That to me, it's difficult to see

44:04.879 --> 44:12.328
how one person can live through the two jobs 
concurrently. I think that's one thing that got

44:14.080 --> 44:16.022
Earl Rutter. It may have contributed some to Jack 
Williams.

44:23.811 --> 44:40.729
But

44:23.811 --> 44:40.729
as you may know, a legislative committee in 1948

44:23.811 --> 44:40.729
visited A&M as a result of a student uprising.

44:44.658 --> 44:51.649
And

44:44.658 --> 44:51.649
they had marched on the president's home.

44:57.297 --> 45:00.141
In effect, they wanted more attention for student 
matters. Well,

45:01.964 --> 45:10.497
Haskell legislature appointed a committee to 
come investigate it.

45:13.328 --> 45:39.437
Incidentally on that committee was a 
brother-in-law of mine at that time a senator from

45:13.328 --> 45:39.437
Dallas

45:13.328 --> 45:39.437
Fred Harris, oh, yes, okay a Baylor graduate now a

45:13.328 --> 45:39.437
Part of that committee's report said clearly you 
should separate the two positions name a

45:13.328 --> 45:39.437
chancellor and a president and

45:42.961 --> 45:45.164
And proceed accordingly. I don't know when that 
was abandoned. When Dr. Harrington retired? Yes.

45:54.797 --> 45:57.822
And I think he retired a little earlier than he 
wanted to. Oh, yes, yes. And Mr. Rutter acquired

45:59.023 --> 46:03.770
both? Both positions, yeah. Okay. Because I have 
heard a myth, you might have been in the room, I've

46:10.231 --> 46:22.170
heard a myth that at some key committee meeting, I 
don't know whether it was Dean's or not, Mr. Rutter

46:10.231 --> 46:22.170
came back from some session somewhere and came 
into the room and closed the door and said, I won.

46:23.472 --> 46:26.156
That he and Harrington had been going toe-to-toe. 
It had been a test of strength, and he supposedly

46:26.797 --> 46:29.321
had won. Hadn't heard about that. Then I heard Dr. 
Harrington say, say, post-retirement a couple of

46:33.991 --> 46:40.051
times, I heard him say, well, I got fired twice. I 
got fired as president and as chancellor.
