WEBVTT

00:01.398 --> 00:11.933
This

00:01.398 --> 00:11.933
is Deborah Beale, and I'm interviewing Dr. 
Michael Pustay on the history of Texas

00:01.398 --> 00:11.933
Engineering Experiment Station. The date is June 
11, 1984.

00:18.683 --> 00:25.954
And what I'd first like to start with is a little 
biographical sketch of you and how you came to A&M.

00:27.605 --> 00:38.157
Let's start with education as one of the best 
places to start. Well, I'm a C minor graduate

00:38.177 --> 00:42.362
working in economics at Washington University 
and 69 in Dublin. Master's of philosophy and PhD in

00:42.382 --> 00:49.950
economics from Yale in 1973. I taught at Purdue for 
five years and Bowling Green for two years. and

00:55.786 --> 01:09.762
I've

00:55.786 --> 01:09.762
been in there for four years. I guess I've been the 
head of the business and technology research

01:09.782 --> 01:13.186
division for three years. I've been also the 
research coordinator for research and

01:13.206 --> 01:17.130
technology business for three years or two. We're 
set up together. We're set up together. So I

01:18.151 --> 01:18.772
basically work two things. I'm a member of the 
business and public policy group in the

01:18.792 --> 01:20.494
department of management. in the

01:21.723 --> 01:43.562
College of Business,

01:21.723 --> 01:43.562
which makes, and I'm also an associate professor 
in basically the DPD group of colleges, and a group

01:21.723 --> 01:43.562
of economists and lawyers who look at the 
interface between business and government,

01:21.723 --> 01:43.562
dealing with that's one of the, the government, is 
one of the major determinants of profitability in

01:43.947 --> 01:50.318
business strategies. So it's important to 
provide some indication to business

01:50.338 --> 02:03.620
students as to how the public sector and the 
private sector interact. How did you make the

02:03.640 --> 02:07.727
transition to maintenance management? I don't 
think there's that strong of a boundary. My two

02:12.807 --> 02:26.559
previous affiliations were in econ departments 
that were part of colleges of business.

02:26.579 --> 02:27.680
So it's really not been a very big transition. I can 
do what I want to do. The basic

02:31.744 --> 02:35.908
criterion is that I One half of me has got

02:36.395 --> 02:57.316
to continue my own research agenda, which I've 
been doing, specializing in regulation of

02:36.395 --> 02:57.316
transportation, effective regulation, 
deregulation, or performance of those

02:36.395 --> 02:57.316
industries. So I'm not doing anything 
differently than I would have been doing, and that

02:57.336 --> 02:59.298
I hadn't been doing. So it's not that big of a deal. 
The establishment of the research organization

03:04.188 --> 03:09.076
within the College of Business and the Teens 
Division. How did that come about? I'm not totally

03:11.460 --> 03:27.546
sure, but certainly one impetus was Bill Mobley's 
going from department head of management to

03:11.460 --> 03:27.546
associate dean in the college. When Mobley came 
in, he and I came in at the same time in August of

03:28.319 --> 03:39.077
1980, that summer of 1980. Mobley had a fairly 
extensive record as a funded researcher, doing a

03:39.097 --> 03:50.897
lot of work

03:39.097 --> 03:50.897
in the Office of Medical Research. The college was 
under-resourced. didn't

03:53.564 --> 04:06.233
have

03:53.564 --> 04:06.233
as many resources as needed or needs. And one of the 
things that Bill identified as a means of solving

04:06.253 --> 04:09.801
the resource problem is to fund the research area. 
I don't think that the college had a particularly

04:10.422 --> 04:18.798
extensive record of funding research activity up 
until that point. When I came here, I came with two

04:18.818 --> 04:25.090
grants, two contracts from the Department of 
Transportation and the Small Business

04:18.818 --> 04:25.090
Administration. And I think Bill, and at that same 
time, Bill and two members of the management

04:26.588 --> 04:36.038
department were proposing also, you know, 
research, which had gotten funded. And that, I

04:36.058 --> 04:40.784
think, was the majority of the funding in the 
college. So I guess I'm trying to, in a long-winded

04:40.804 --> 04:46.670
fashion, try to say that Bill viewed funded 
research as an opportunity for the college to

04:40.804 --> 04:46.670
generate resources. He had made that an objective 
of the college, excuse me, of the department when

04:46.690 --> 04:54.739
it became department head.

04:57.858 --> 05:16.838
When he became Associate Dean, I had the suspicion 
that he mentioned

04:57.858 --> 05:16.838
to Ben Dean and Bill Hughes that this is one area 
that we need to fund the research. We need to

05:16.858 --> 05:20.882
promote funded research at the college level as it 
reduces our own resources. I think that that is the

05:20.902 --> 05:22.684
impetus for the creation of the college research 
board position. Basically, simultaneously, the

05:28.665 --> 05:45.516
college decided

05:28.665 --> 05:45.516
that one direction, one area that identified as 
important to the state, important to the business

05:28.665 --> 05:45.516
disciplines,

05:48.820 --> 05:59.775
in an area that really hadn't been tapped by the 
College of Business

05:48.820 --> 05:59.775
was the interface between business and 
engineering, particularly with regard to

05:48.820 --> 05:59.775
technology transfer. the whole general

06:00.346 --> 06:11.504
question of, we've got this new technology out 
there, how do we integrate that into our business

06:00.346 --> 06:11.504
community? And we felt that, you know, very 
natural linkage with the College of Engineering,

06:12.084 --> 06:17.753
in that regard. In some sense, that's what the 
tease is, in some sense, set up to do that kind of

06:17.773 --> 06:21.319
thing. Bill Houston and Skip Porter got along, get 
along very well. I think they share some common

06:22.561 --> 06:26.607
visions. Certainly, you know, It was

06:27.008 --> 06:52.893
a piece of

06:27.008 --> 06:52.893
evidence that came after that was

06:27.008 --> 06:52.893
that how do we get a proper, you know, further step 
with this notion of how do we take technology, how

06:27.008 --> 06:52.893
do we do the engineering, how do we get things in the 
workplace? And so BATTER developed a very, very

06:52.913 --> 06:56.897
reasonably, or BATTER developed, for the most 
part, sort of that sort of vision that was shined

06:52.913 --> 06:56.897
upon the AFCRA principal architecture. That's 
what it's called, battered? Well, we call it

06:59.070 --> 07:03.361
battered.

07:04.905 --> 07:10.178
What are the major funding things through teams at 
this point in your vision? We've got two

07:12.942 --> 07:16.868
office-enabled research contracts. We're in the 
third year of one that's in jargon terms called

07:17.308 --> 07:24.419
transition and socialization. And basically 
what that means is when people are either leaving

07:24.439 --> 07:37.077
more internal jobs or they're changing or 
transferring to an organization, how do you

07:24.439 --> 07:37.077
facilitate that transition?

07:42.710 --> 07:52.090
Obviously that's a problem of great importance to 
the military, sending people every two years,

07:42.710 --> 07:52.090
every three years to a tour of duty, sometimes with 
their families, sometimes without. How do you

07:52.892 --> 08:00.448
transfer them, get them up to speed, integrate 
them into the community, get them knowledge about

07:52.892 --> 08:00.448
their job? So it's a natural question of concern to 
the opposite end of research. It clearly is a

08:10.797 --> 08:23.209
question of interest to the business community, 
since the business community transfers people as

08:10.797 --> 08:23.209
well. And it's in great interest just from its 
basic research perspective in the college, in

08:23.449 --> 08:32.477
terms of how to organize and manage a school, and 
what's the psychology of it, what's the

08:23.449 --> 08:32.477
management of it. What impact does it have on the 
national performance? Does it work out well to

08:38.582 --> 08:48.991
spend X dollars to fly the wives in for a 
preliminary trip, or is it not worth it to panoply

08:38.582 --> 08:48.991
the questions that are being asked? In general, 
the college has tried to stress a way called the

08:49.011 --> 08:56.698
lean, lean research, which is the research that 
generates resources. And that is, in a lean, lean

08:56.838 --> 09:02.363
sense, that at least leads to published research 
in professional reference journals. So the

09:07.846 --> 09:15.578
college

09:07.846 --> 09:15.578
is a very strong research organization. In 
essence, we really don't want to . There's

09:16.459 --> 09:26.595
a strong encouragement for faculty to publish in 
professional journals, and we don't

09:16.459 --> 09:26.595
particularly

09:29.191 --> 09:33.238
Walk

09:29.191 --> 09:33.238
them through this. Praise the Lord. It's much 
better for all parties concerned. Whatever

09:39.892 --> 09:48.408
funded research they do also leads to 
publications, peer-reviewed journals. So

09:48.428 --> 09:50.452
that's where the lean-in comes in. O&R would be a 
premier example of lean-in research, because it

09:50.472 --> 09:59.509
does generate the sources, and it does . MS. 
Generating more resources? Well, generating

10:00.511 --> 10:07.718
resources, I mean, in the sense that it provides 
release time to faculty, to the researchers, to

10:00.511 --> 10:07.718
the grad students. The grants, et cetera. The 
grants, et cetera. Of course, to the extent that

10:10.061 --> 10:17.708
you do that work well, you can generate other 
things. Hello, Mike, who's that? All right. I bet

10:20.611 --> 10:24.195
they're waiting on it. So it generates more 
resources. provides to the extent that you do a

10:27.562 --> 10:50.102
piece of funded research well, allows you to go 
back and sponsor other sponsors and get more

10:27.562 --> 10:50.102
research and a couple of support, to the extent 
that you can generate more publications, it gives

10:27.562 --> 10:50.102
you that much more of a professional reputation. 
But again, it makes it easier to . Is most of the

10:50.823 --> 10:54.246
sponsored research coming from government 
sources or from ? It's certainly the bulk of the

10:54.266 --> 10:56.708
dollars. That O&R grant was, what does it say, 
we're in the third year of

10:56.688 --> 11:10.993
that, and it's a little less than 300,000 dollars, 
about $100,000 each year. We have another O&R

11:11.013 --> 11:17.143
grant that we're in the first year of, we're 
studying organizations' information

11:11.013 --> 11:17.143
processing system. and that's

11:18.524 --> 11:38.676
about

11:39.888 --> 11:48.502
$150,000

11:39.888 --> 11:48.502
of support from the Department of Transportation 
with the trucking deregulation. About 60,000

11:48.522 --> 11:58.077
from the Small Business Administration with the 
trucking deregulation. That's the Deere Direct

11:58.097 --> 11:59.559
Line. Right. And we've had about 60,000 from the 
Small Business Administration with the

12:01.302 --> 12:08.838
financial deregulation of financial markets and 
how it affects small value markets. And we have

12:08.858 --> 12:12.625
some indication that we may have additional funds 
there. We've got another proposal in to the Office

12:12.646 --> 12:21.083
of Naval Research from two members of the initial 
team. going

12:21.063 --> 12:36.828
to

12:21.063 --> 12:36.828
look

12:21.063 --> 12:36.828
at performance feedback of the . Where

12:36.848 --> 12:46.284
you get a notion when you do a good job, you . Those 
are the biggest dollar amounts. But I guess about

12:47.065 --> 12:48.387
$100,000 a month called industrial development . 
There was a research division of TEAS that was

12:49.548 --> 12:58.056
merged into us about two years ago.

13:04.499 --> 13:14.395
trying to assess the strengths and weaknesses of 
local communities and in terms of their

13:04.499 --> 13:14.395
industrial development potential. I'm trying to 
give them this notion of what kinds of firms they

13:14.415 --> 13:23.250
should be targeting and what types of and also what 
can they do to overcome some of the weaknesses,

13:24.597 --> 13:32.164
sort of like strategic marketing or strategic 
management. No, those things are on a fee basis to

13:32.185 --> 13:41.794
the

13:32.185 --> 13:41.794
communities. Yes. They're not

13:42.034 --> 13:48.340
particularly lucrative from our perspective. 
There is sort of service component to it, but

13:48.361 --> 13:51.904
they're on a fee basis. In terms of publishing, how 
does that work? Those generally, those are not

13:57.532 --> 14:00.094
research. Those generally do not have a research 
publication component to them. As a result, we

14:06.500 --> 14:18.972
tend to develop as a core of graduate students, 
cadres of graduate students who do that work under

14:06.500 --> 14:18.972
the faculty supervision. We view that more as a 
training exercise for PhD students.

14:24.627 --> 14:29.266
Particularly, we have a couple in the market that 
are more interested in that. So they view it as a

14:29.286 --> 14:30.953
service market. It provides them support. It 
provides them a little bit of visibility. It also

14:37.785 --> 14:41.872
provides them with kind of a dry run for the 
dissertation. In essence, having to go out there

14:41.893 --> 14:48.384
and find out what the data sources are and having to 
be able to get information from them. So those are a

14:48.404 --> 14:55.236
variety, those are valuable research

14:48.404 --> 14:55.236
skills which are which fit very nicely with the 
pedagogical mission of college. Have the

15:00.496 --> 15:03.940
graduate students been doing this for years? This 
isn't just a new model. Well, in the college

15:09.326 --> 15:22.201
they've been doing it for, say, two years now, in 
the past, before it was part of us, I think they were

15:09.326 --> 15:22.201
using full-time staff. I think they had a problem. 
that they were having trouble getting enough

15:24.950 --> 15:36.462
work,

15:24.950 --> 15:36.462
given the price they had to charge on their 
full-time staff. When

15:37.859 --> 15:51.496
did they move to the Center for Strategic 
Technology and they moved it back out? I think it

15:52.056 --> 15:56.281
was independent of Media, Industry, and 
Technology. I think it moved out and then it moved

15:56.362 --> 15:58.484
to us. Well, it had been around since the blues, 
that beginning division. I've been told that

16:00.366 --> 16:01.588
division at one time made a lot of money. Oh, it did. 
In the 50s it was going crazy. And I don't know if you

16:02.429 --> 16:07.019
were aware that they were doing freight rate 
studies. In 1939,

16:07.961 --> 16:18.042
the state of Texas commissioned them to do freight 
rate studies because they were bringing suits in

16:18.022 --> 16:23.050
front of the ICC for discriminatory freight 
rates. And so they did tons of freight rate studies

16:24.131 --> 16:33.085
of different things in Texas and comparative to 
other states in that period. And this was the same

16:33.105 --> 16:35.628
group of people. And then they grew into the 
industrial community surveys from that. I was

16:42.018 --> 16:52.691
told the industrial community surveys were quite 
lucrative back when the federal government was

16:42.018 --> 16:52.691
dumping a lot of money into community planning. 
They would give a panel $50,000 and say, go plan.

16:55.535 --> 16:58.799
And they'd say, well, we don't have a plan. So what 
they would do is turn around and commission

16:58.819 --> 17:04.405
industrial economics to do a survey. But 
apparently that money's drying up. So we kind of

17:05.887 --> 17:11.434
got it that it was not the most lucrative activity. 
But you think you've been able to turn it into

17:11.617 --> 17:16.405
something a little different? Well, I think we've 
managed to make it into something useful for the

17:16.425 --> 17:22.857
college and for the communities of Texas. We've 
had relatively low, at lower cost than both

17:23.518 --> 17:29.589
parties.

17:29.609 --> 17:32.173
Where it's going to go, it's all up to you.

17:36.136 --> 17:56.707
We've also actually

17:36.136 --> 17:56.707
turned

17:36.136 --> 17:56.707
it into a vehicle for publishing directories. 
We've got two directories now. We've got one

17:57.348 --> 17:58.991
directory out in the Middle East, the choice is in 
the press. One is an industrial parks directory,

17:59.011 --> 18:01.975
which we think will be useful for community 
planning for those who are interested in

17:59.011 --> 18:01.975
industrial development. Is

18:02.596 --> 18:27.285
that the only thing that came with the TEAS

18:02.596 --> 18:27.285
division? Basically. You're grinning.

18:33.468 --> 18:44.079
What it came with was one secretary who had become a 
staff member. He came

18:44.099 --> 18:52.689
with a few desks, and we got a 1980 Chevrolet out of 
it, and an out-motor board, possibly. A hearty

18:52.709 --> 18:53.089
handshake. Yeah, thank you for taking that off 
their hands. Well, you know, again, you get into

18:58.017 --> 19:11.035
his idiosyncrasies of history, but the dean at the 
time was Bill Muse, who was...

18:58.017 --> 19:11.035
Hello? You were talking about the idiosyncrasies 
taking off their hands. Oh, that Bill Muse was...

19:19.073 --> 19:25.643
I'm very concerned about local

19:19.073 --> 19:25.643
development. The vice president of the local 
chamber of commerce for industrial development,

19:25.663 --> 19:42.729
he felt at this stage that the college's 
development would be very useful to start to build

19:25.663 --> 19:42.729
outreach programs in the community. So he was very 
enthusiastic about bringing

19:48.385 --> 20:03.525
I guess, apparently, a couple of years 
previously, or maybe not a couple of years

19:48.385 --> 20:03.525
previously, we had talked before about setting up 
a linkage between the college and the teams. that

20:03.809 --> 20:09.915
industrial economics was considered as one of the 
possible vehicles. But I think when you were

20:10.436 --> 20:18.244
talking about going to the Center, I mean, the 
Center for Strategic Technology was going to give

20:10.436 --> 20:18.244
up industrial economics. Apparently there was 
some consideration just at the beginning of the

20:18.264 --> 20:23.329
College of Business at that point. I think John 
Roberts wrote a couple of impassioned memoirs

20:23.410 --> 20:28.635
saying, you know, let me have a chance to run it. 
gave

20:28.615 --> 20:40.718
him a

20:28.615 --> 20:40.718
shot.

20:41.812 --> 20:43.536
That's something with idiosyncrasies. In some 
sense, that was part of Bill Muse's vision of how he

20:43.556 --> 20:53.496
wanted the college to develop. What do you see as 
Tease's role in the College of Business Research?

21:10.246 --> 21:37.080
I'm not sure I phrased it quite that way, but

21:10.246 --> 21:37.080
I guess I would say that I think that there is an 
overlap, a considerable overlap in interest of

21:10.246 --> 21:37.080
TEAS's, the College of Engineering, and the 
College of Business' research missions that,

21:10.246 --> 21:37.080
especially as the state of Texas moves away from 
energy, and natural resources-based economy to a

21:38.309 --> 21:50.832
more high-tech economy,

21:38.309 --> 21:50.832
which is currently the governor's dream and other 
political actors' opinions as well. To the extent

21:50.852 --> 21:57.865
that Texas is going to pull it off, we're going to 
have to marry business and science. We're going to

21:57.885 --> 22:01.431
have to be able to do the research. in

22:01.850 --> 22:23.408
terms of the technology,

22:01.850 --> 22:23.408
but you have to also be able to deliver it in terms of 
providing the proper business program, proper

22:01.850 --> 22:23.408
opportunities for businesses to locate you and to 
develop you. And I would view the College of

22:23.428 --> 22:25.191
Business as providing some important insights 
into that. There's also a significant research

22:25.643 --> 22:36.841
overlap just in terms of what between two 
colleges, especially in our business and health

22:25.643 --> 22:36.841
department. We've got the computer science 
department, there's also a business computer

22:37.062 --> 22:43.673
science department. Industrial engineering 
does a fair

22:43.693 --> 22:52.427
amount of applied statistical

22:54.938 --> 23:03.168
problems, as does organic farming, applying 
statistics to business decision making, applied

22:54.938 --> 23:03.168
to engineering decision making. In the 
management department, they've got, you know, we

23:03.368 --> 23:08.975
have industrial relations and personnel 
practices. They've got a counterpart over

23:08.995 --> 23:12.499
engineering. So there's actually a fairly large 
overlap in the programs of the two colleges. to

23:19.728 --> 23:24.695
pull the two researcher groups together at all, or 
is this the hope for the future? Well, the research

23:24.715 --> 23:28.059
has been pulled together on an ad hoc basis. In 
industrial engineering, we've created decision

23:29.561 --> 23:43.660
support, decision support biotech, and a couple 
of our researchers were on the ground where they

23:29.561 --> 23:43.660
are helping to develop that. In terms

23:44.450 --> 24:10.120
of InVet, which Chris Porter

23:44.450 --> 24:10.120
is talking about InVet, the College of Business

23:44.450 --> 24:10.120
has been a major provider of human resources for 
InVet. Well, I'd say about $140,000. I know that

24:12.799 --> 24:23.148
they're paying about $140,000 to the college this 
year in various forms, which would be about $3,000

24:12.799 --> 24:23.148
or $4,000. Okay. For the Invent? Is Invent a 
win-win?

24:32.116 --> 24:37.320
From the viewpoint of publications, not 
necessarily. That is a problem. From the

24:39.462 --> 24:45.170
viewpoint of student development, it's a 
terrific opportunity. I'm going to try and use the

24:45.190 --> 24:47.153
student development that way. If we can get our 
students into the process, and they are to a

24:47.173 --> 25:02.736
certain extent, learning the screening of 
inventions, the development of business plans,

24:47.173 --> 25:02.736
the marketing analysis, those would be extremely 
good. in terms

25:02.716 --> 25:24.150
of faculty research and publications,

25:02.716 --> 25:24.150
it's a bit more conjectural. We've gotten a few 
publications out of it, but not as many as we would

25:24.170 --> 25:28.858
like to, or not as many as we would need to . That's a 
good question. It's, you know, it sounds like a

25:34.858 --> 25:54.306
great idea, but with the publisher parish 
problems, it's... What we've tried to do is

25:34.858 --> 25:54.306
communicate to both our faculty, well, I think our 
faculty, but to communicate to them that if we want

25:34.858 --> 25:54.306
to have a long-term, near-term relationship, It 
really has to be winning for our faculty. We can't

25:57.550 --> 26:00.775
ask people to go over there and sacrifice their 
careers. So we've been trying to put it on what I

26:00.795 --> 26:04.460
would call teaching a buyout basis. If someone 
works over for Invent,

26:04.920 --> 26:21.863
that

26:04.920 --> 26:21.863
they get compensated as if they were teaching. 
Generally, I think that when we pay someone to

26:22.197 --> 26:39.256
teach, say during the academic year, normally for 
every hour that he's in the classroom, he or she is

26:22.197 --> 26:39.256
in the classroom, that person has an hour outside 
of the

26:22.197 --> 26:39.256
classroom to do it. Now you know what I do as 
research

26:39.596 --> 26:44.081
board. You're talking about the pay. That 
normally faculty, when you're on an academic, but

26:51.560 --> 27:19.086
we view them as this is kind of a gross term, that 
they put an hour in in the classroom and the

26:51.560 --> 27:19.086
classroom related activities, and then they have 
an hour of free time, which we would hope that they

26:51.560 --> 27:19.086
would be involved in doing their own research and 
or in well, departmental citizenship,

26:51.560 --> 27:19.086
interviewing their job candidates, et cetera, et 
cetera.

27:22.373 --> 27:31.308
If Invent,

27:22.373 --> 27:31.308
to make it win-win for Invent, Invent's basically 
got a treat-out back in the same room. And for every

27:32.049 --> 27:36.757
hour they work over there, they've got to have an 
hour to do their research. It's for the

27:36.777 --> 27:38.419
professional development. For the professional 
development. In the short run, Invent can go to

27:40.243 --> 27:43.588
people and say, We're going to pay you 40 hours, you 
have to work for a year. They can do that. They're

27:49.065 --> 27:59.658
going to view themselves, they're going to wind up 
being the supplier of last markets, or excuse me,

27:49.065 --> 27:59.658
the employer of last markets among the factory. I 
think that's counterproductive as far as the

27:59.678 --> 28:03.163
innovation is concerned.

28:06.721 --> 28:08.645
I think they're generally understandable. At 
that point, we get it to where it's really neutral.

28:16.038 --> 28:16.780
Right. What are your responsibilities besides 
answering phones? Well, the...

28:24.338 --> 28:35.678
The two objectives are to promote the research 
activities of the college and to generate the

28:24.338 --> 28:35.678
resources necessary to accomplish the research. 
Objective two leads back to objective one. It's

28:40.808 --> 28:41.349
basically to simplify. The college, I think, has a 
pretty clear goal of wanting to crack the top five

28:41.369 --> 28:48.321
public universities. among public 
universities, it wants to be the top five business

28:50.174 --> 28:55.257
schools in the country. and to

28:56.452 --> 29:11.430
achieve that objective we've got to, and one of the 
means of achieving that objective is to increase

28:56.452 --> 29:11.430
our prominence in research. And to that extent we 
have to find resources to support our

29:11.450 --> 29:16.636
researchers. The dean is devoting a fair amount of 
his time to external development of the

29:16.656 --> 29:21.902
fundraising. which a large chunk of that will be 
delegated to providing faculty support, faculty

29:23.452 --> 29:44.360
summer, faculty summer support, support for 
research assistance, but it's all going to go

29:23.452 --> 29:44.360
back, in essence,

29:23.452 --> 29:44.360
to promote research. The TEAS connection, we 
feel, is a mechanism for promoting research.

29:49.307 --> 29:51.670
Funded research is a mechanism for promoting 
research. Are you not only relying on TEAS for

29:52.612 --> 29:59.540
funded

29:52.612 --> 29:59.540
research? Are you going to the research 
foundation? Well, realize that TEAS does a couple

30:02.242 --> 30:06.227
things. One, TEAS does provide us with certain 
financial resources. Secondly, TEAS does

30:10.752 --> 30:14.556
contract administration. It administers the 
contracts and provides all the support services

30:14.576 --> 30:18.400
that are necessary. The Research Foundation does 
some of that as well, and also the Division where

30:19.139 --> 30:25.326
TEAS and the Research Foundation also work 
together.

30:27.648 --> 30:30.411
So TEAS provides some financial support. TEAS 
also provides all that personal support

30:30.431 --> 30:34.315
services. TEAS also provides some leadership and 
some leadership. I wouldn't put the College of

30:39.721 --> 30:48.370
Business in a follower relationship to TEAS, but I 
think that there's a general feeling that So,

30:48.670 --> 31:09.362
do

30:48.670 --> 31:09.362
you pretty well, in terms of going after money, is 
it up to the professors themselves

31:09.747 --> 31:15.459
you are doing, or is it something that TEAS does, 
comes in and says, hey, this is available? There's

31:15.479 --> 31:18.585
a variety of mechanisms. I would imagine this is 
universal throughout all the green communities.

31:22.724 --> 31:25.627
Some of the research is simply faculty-driven. 
Professors say, I'm interested in this. It comes

31:27.369 --> 31:28.430
to me. Where can I get money for this? We'll tell 
them about this agency, this agency, this agency,

31:29.972 --> 31:37.020
our possible possibilities, write a report for 
them, write a paper for us, and so on. Some we get

31:37.040 --> 31:39.162
from the research foundation. They send out lists 
of all our RFPs from the federal government who

31:39.202 --> 31:47.311
request proposals. We will give the RFP, then 
distribute to our faculty and say, if you're

31:47.331 --> 31:52.056
interested in this one, your order for you. 
Occasionally, T's will come to us and say, hey,

31:55.526 --> 32:02.989
we've got an idea that the polls are not written. 
Can you get somebody to For example, I was talking

32:05.570 --> 32:14.804
to Boeing Computing Systems about doing some 
research on Class 6

32:05.570 --> 32:14.804
computers. And they said, well, we've got the 
engineers involved, but we need someone who's

32:14.824 --> 32:20.914
interested in this community. And I was telling 
them about marketing. Can you locate someone for

32:21.915 --> 32:22.937
us? And so I located someone. There are times, at 
least they've got another one, where they think

32:24.419 --> 32:37.562
the Air Force is going to let our contract for our 
materials lab are done, and they ask us if we could

32:24.419 --> 32:37.562
help them. Actually, it's called Manufacturing 
Sciences. If we could provide them with some

32:39.746 --> 32:42.310
people like that, too. We were going to be writing a 
proposal to IBM, and it's going to be useful for us

32:43.201 --> 32:55.816
to demonstrate that we've got a 
multidisciplinary approach to it. And we'll go to

32:55.836 --> 33:06.289
them and say, and I'll probably go to Bruce 
McCormick, head of computer science, or to Eric

32:55.836 --> 33:06.289
Charles of the Academy of Industrial Engineering 
and say, hey, We need some help from you guys to

33:06.269 --> 33:13.240
round out what's possible and presumptions that 
they'll help us. So it's a two-way street

33:13.640 --> 33:18.548
regarding who helps who. It is

33:18.568 --> 33:31.087
only where the research comes from or how it's 
initiated that really varies across the

33:18.568 --> 33:31.087
spectrum. But is your job also to cancel the other I 
would view

33:35.007 --> 33:51.257
myself as, in some sense, a repository for 
information, a dispenser of information. Since

33:51.277 --> 33:54.282
all information, one way or another, 
conceptualizing is that all information about

33:54.515 --> 34:03.709
research flows into me and then I disperse it to 
those things that's useful information.

34:03.729 --> 34:04.690
Information is costly. Transmitting 
information is costly. If you can centralize that

34:06.292 --> 34:11.079
function, there are some advantages. When people 
have problems with a research project they've

34:11.100 --> 34:24.319
already got, because they've got a problem with a 
research foundation or they've run into a

34:11.100 --> 34:24.319
bureaucratic staff who they'll come to me and I'll 
figure out who they should talk to.

34:26.982 --> 34:42.058
If someone's interested in writing a proposal, 
I'll try and help them out, even if it's locating a

34:26.982 --> 34:42.058
sponsor or telling them what the situation is, or 
perhaps dissuading

34:26.982 --> 34:42.058
them. I am in charge, I would say, of some career 
counseling responsibilities,

34:42.078 --> 34:49.967
which are basically given to me by the dean. For 
example,

34:53.273 --> 35:07.615
We view funded research as being desirable, as 
rounding out a professor's retail,

34:53.273 --> 35:07.615
but we think it's a higher risk activity to them, 
especially the writing of the results. And we

35:07.855 --> 35:12.282
certainly do not want to encourage our students to 
engage. We'd much rather they spent their time

35:12.302 --> 35:20.935
lining their dissertation, getting a couple 
articles out of it, than engaging in a blind

35:12.302 --> 35:20.935
proposal to the NSF. One of the things I do each year 
is have an orientation session. We're just in

35:26.943 --> 35:31.669
funded research, but this really isn't for you. 
This perhaps is not for you at this stage in your

35:31.689 --> 35:34.953
career. Crank out the easy ones first. Crank out 
the easy ones first. Part of this is that in a funded

35:38.658 --> 35:44.325
research group, reputation helps. And if you're 
an unproven assistant professor, you're

35:44.345 --> 35:50.533
swimming upstream.

35:53.939 --> 36:00.372
It's a high enough risk activity to begin with, and 
the odds are stacked against you even more.

36:04.098 --> 36:07.503
We just don't want people to misinterpret the 
signals. They read in the faculty guidelines for

36:07.884 --> 36:12.111
evaluation that funded research are desirable. 
We want them to say, oh, I've got to get to the

36:12.131 --> 36:17.819
funding restriction. That's fine once you've 
made a reputation. If you want to write a proposal,

36:18.701 --> 36:20.904
that's fine. But we're not going to force you to. We 
don't force anybody to do anything. But we don't

36:25.572 --> 36:27.895
want to even say that. We're not encouraging you. 
We want you to think that you've got to do it. Just

36:32.566 --> 36:43.441
build your record, and when you feel comfortable 
with it, deal with it, and try to write a proposal

36:32.566 --> 36:43.441
for it. No proposal before it's done. As head of the 
division, are you on Matisse payroll part-time?

36:50.931 --> 36:52.634
Yes. Is it half-time? It's about half-time. 
And...

37:02.941 --> 37:14.908
Do you think this, then releasing, giving release 
time to you, essentially, to service this

37:02.941 --> 37:14.908
function as a repository of information, does 
that help the department and the school Not

37:16.238 --> 37:19.904
necessarily because it's you, but because... 
Well, I would hope so. And if I didn't think it was a

37:20.585 --> 37:28.980
useful expenditure of funds, I would suggest, you 
know, I would recommend that we would abolish the

37:20.585 --> 37:28.980
position. In other words, you're not getting 
ready to recommend to abolish the position. No,

37:31.584 --> 37:33.828
I'm not... No, I think in fact that the...

37:36.693 --> 37:38.095
I think in fact that... I would

37:38.581 --> 37:54.210
probably recommend that there are more things 
that are necessary

37:38.581 --> 37:54.210
to be done.

37:56.857 --> 38:00.344
But the experiment is succeeding? I think the 
experiment is succeeding. I think it was clear it

38:02.748 --> 38:12.747
was a wise decision three years ago to give someone 
responsibility

38:02.748 --> 38:12.747
for basically looking after research. Before 
there was no real ombudsman for research. I think

38:18.037 --> 38:19.540
it's been very useful.

38:23.468 --> 38:42.487
Have, you know, this has only been around for three 
years, but have there been any major economic or

38:23.468 --> 38:42.487
business orientation changes that have changed 
the amount of funding from either private or

38:23.468 --> 38:42.487
public sources? Well, I think we've hit upon it. We 
really haven't been just as long enough to have a

38:44.549 --> 38:49.394
consistent track record. I mean, we don't know. I 
think that...

38:55.244 --> 39:04.283
I think last year we put a major push on to get 
resources from, to get more private resources,

38:55.244 --> 39:04.283
more private companies. And we found that that was 
a lousy time. Time was lousy given what the

39:08.051 --> 39:11.799
business cycle was. So that was not particularly 
successful. I think we also found that we were

39:13.925 --> 39:16.608
premature. We thought that the people out there 
who were, we found out that Texas A&M, we have a

39:16.948 --> 39:25.176
college of business research. That's terrific. 
We're really glad to hear about it. That took us

39:28.919 --> 39:42.312
down a peg and we realized that we have some, we have 
a PR problem that we're not as well known as we

39:28.919 --> 39:42.312
thought we should be. Our department's, the 
college is very young, I think it started in the

39:42.882 --> 39:47.993
sixties. Our department's generally learned 
very well, research-wise. I think the management

39:54.787 --> 40:04.266
department was ranked third in a recent survey of 
academy management from public universities,

39:54.787 --> 40:04.266
after Elmore and Berkley. So we're

40:04.853 --> 40:27.655
starting to

40:04.853 --> 40:27.655
see indications that our research program is . 
Generally, we haven't gotten any established

40:30.200 --> 40:40.417
scholars because we've had a tendency to

40:30.200 --> 40:40.417
build from the bottom. So we've got very young 
people. The only part we've really got is really, I

40:41.098 --> 40:48.010
guess we've got Pete Rose and Don Frey and Finian 
Scott. We've got very established scholars. We

40:50.703 --> 41:01.640
think our better days are ahead of us. I think I lost 
myself there. You were talking about the

41:05.266 --> 41:14.280
development and the question was about whether 
there were any cycles.

41:14.260 --> 41:21.430
What we found was that we thought it was a cycle in 
the sense that we ran into trouble in the last

41:14.260 --> 41:21.430
business cycle. You hit the wrong one. But we also 
found that we were not as well known as we thought we

41:24.655 --> 41:28.740
were. So we decided we better take a step back and do 
a little more work. So we created what we call the

41:35.330 --> 41:41.398
research newsletter, which we're sending out 
to... I think about 1,000 chief executive

41:42.188 --> 41:55.667
officers in Texas and national

41:42.188 --> 41:55.667
companies, all new deans of colleges and 
businesses in the country, and a variety of other

41:42.188 --> 41:55.667
mailing lists that are out there. That's the 
business college. It's a newsletter, isn't it?

41:58.011 --> 41:58.131
Right. And a T is connected to it. Well, actually, 
it's jointly put out by Batter and not the College

41:59.954 --> 42:04.921
of Business. A lot of our stuff is jointly put out by 
Batter and the College of Business, because I've

42:04.941 --> 42:12.111
got full of his heads up. So a lot of times, we talk 
about the College of Business, and it really

42:12.496 --> 42:29.679
refers back to Batter, because Batter is, in some 
sense, a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of the

42:12.496 --> 42:29.679
College of Business, which is also owned

42:12.496 --> 42:29.679
by Keyes. So we're putting out the newsletter just 
now. Inform people

42:32.223 --> 42:48.690
that,

42:32.223 --> 42:48.690
yes, we are

42:32.223 --> 42:48.690
indeed doing some research. We're sending out the 
newsletter to all the Texas newspapers and

42:48.710 --> 42:50.212
magazines. Just at the end of it, we build them on 
each of our community leaders the notion that,

42:50.232 --> 42:52.857
yes, this is a place we're working on. That was our 
first attempt to overcome that. the deficiency

42:54.683 --> 42:59.956
that we saw in the problem recognition. So I think 
TEAS itself is having the same problem. And

43:03.044 --> 43:06.111
they've been trying to address it for a few years 
now. Anything

43:07.188 --> 43:15.596
but agriculture here, I think, is the problem. 
Well, the folks in Ag are doing a very good job.

43:17.938 --> 43:18.639
They've been at it for a long time. They've been at 
it for longer, but they've done a good job. And of

43:19.860 --> 43:28.288
course, having county extension in each of the 
counties is helpful. We're not going to do that.

43:30.371 --> 43:36.256
The history department's not going to do that, so 
you've got to find other mechanisms. The state's

43:36.276 --> 43:37.077
not going to fund it either. Is there anything else 
that you'd like to say about your relationship

43:39.082 --> 43:54.565
with teens or the business department's

43:39.082 --> 43:54.565
relationship

43:39.082 --> 43:54.565
with teens that we haven't covered? Not often. I 
guess I've rambled on to be able to richer answer

43:55.286 --> 43:57.189
your questions. Yeah, I'm sure. It's much better 
than

43:57.690 --> 44:02.737
yesterday. I kind of thought that. I guess I'd say 
that the relationship

44:08.596 --> 44:13.788
has

44:08.596 --> 44:13.788
been a very fruitful one. I think it will continue 
to be fruitful in both parties. I think it's a

44:15.332 --> 44:21.887
natural marriage of the interests of the college 
business and the teams. I think it will promote the

44:21.907 --> 44:23.972
mission of both groups.

44:43.034 --> 44:44.476
I think it will help TEAS in terms of its service to 
the state of Texas. It will help the College of

44:44.496 --> 44:47.100
Business in terms of its instructional mission 
and its teaching and its service mission. I think

44:47.120 --> 44:48.202
we're looking to go on and continue to evolve. But 
generally, I think a wealth organization would

44:48.222 --> 44:50.145
less include leadership in people innovation. I 
mean, it's important. And frankly, three years

44:54.314 --> 45:05.247
ago, or four years ago, before I came here, they 
asked me, what do

44:54.314 --> 45:05.247
I think about the management department? I guess 
economics or economists, by training, look at

45:05.267 --> 45:12.195
inputs and outputs and how the inputs are 
transforming the output. Outputs are kind of a

45:12.215 --> 45:13.456
black box. Economists don't concern themselves 
about that. Reality. Yeah. And I never really

45:19.218 --> 45:21.102
thought about that until I got here. Now I'm 
beginning to realize that what goes on in the black

45:21.122 --> 45:24.128
box is important. And one of the things that goes on 
in the black box is leadership. Before

45:27.815 --> 45:32.445
leadership, in my mind, was a touchy-feely 
buzzword that fed me. I still can't define it, but

45:32.465 --> 45:36.132
it's kind of like you know it when you see it. You 
know it when you're involved. And I think both

45:38.577 --> 45:40.180
organizations are doing it.
