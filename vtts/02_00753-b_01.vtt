00:06.595 --> 00:33.328
Dr. Mackin, tell us something about your early 
life, including the names of your parents, the

00:06.595 --> 00:33.328
dates and places of their birth if you remember 
them, the date and place of your birth, the schools

00:06.595 --> 00:33.328
you attended up to the time you entered college,

00:06.595 --> 00:33.328
whatever you can remember of your childhood life. 
I was born in 1903 at Waxahachie, Texas, close to

00:35.620 --> 00:43.829
Dallas.

00:46.932 --> 01:02.910
My mother was Willie Ina Hall Mackin and my father 
Alfred Cecil Mackin Sr.

01:06.653 --> 01:16.788
My father died in my early childhood

01:06.653 --> 01:16.788
in about 1912.

01:19.472 --> 01:34.315
He was a pianist and band director for the Village 
Band in Waxahachie and he was also,

01:19.472 --> 01:34.315
pretty interesting, character in that he played 
the piano for the old silent movies. You've heard

01:41.389 --> 01:42.551
of this. This is one of my earliest remembrances in 
childhood. I was listening to my father in the

01:46.194 --> 01:56.925
local theater playing for the Perils of Pauline or 
whatever it was.

01:59.588 --> 02:03.492
I remember my father mostly for his piano. 
playing, which has led me over the years to collect

02:03.944 --> 02:18.299
most of the world's records in piano music. I have a 
big collection there. My mother...

02:21.583 --> 02:31.774
Incidentally, my father was born in Illinois. at 
the town of Gilman, just below Chicago, and he was

02:32.125 --> 02:45.844
one of the railroad Irish immigrants. Of course, 
we believe that he descended from Brian Beru, as

02:45.864 --> 02:51.231
usual with Irishmen. How close that is to the 
truth, I don't have any idea, you understand. When

02:58.922 --> 03:00.664
my father died, we were... Of course, pretty 
destitute, pretty close to destitute. My mother

03:06.822 --> 03:10.067
became a schoolteacher. We moved to Oklahoma, 
settled at Ada, excuse me, at Durant, Oklahoma

03:10.127 --> 03:31.039
first,

03:10.127 --> 03:31.039
and my mother taught for a while after going to the 
local teacher's college and getting all the

03:31.981 --> 03:42.578
requirements off,

03:31.981 --> 03:42.578
she was there in the public schools for almost 
several years. After that, she went to East

03:45.122 --> 03:54.377
Central State College at Ada, Oklahoma, and was a 
critic teacher first in the model school, later

03:54.830 --> 04:10.853
professor of English, finally ended up as dean of 
women, so I got my academic side through my mother.

04:14.137 --> 04:16.180
To come back And to myself and my own schooling, I 
had some schooling at Waxahachie, I think up to

04:16.160 --> 04:26.774
about fourth grade or somewhere, fourth or fifth, 
I'm not sure of that.

04:29.818 --> 04:38.989
And then some more of it in public schools and into 
the high school at Durant, Oklahoma. I remember

04:39.009 --> 04:45.778
that I was in high school at the time the U.S. 
entered World War II. One,

04:46.703 --> 04:50.388
excuse me. That's 1917, I believe. I went from 
there to the college, a two-year college,

04:53.192 --> 05:07.072
Southeastern State College now in Oklahoma.

05:07.092 --> 05:15.124
Was there a year or something like that that I 
followed my mother to to Ada. She had already left

05:18.330 --> 05:21.334
before I left the college there. I was actually 
working in the high school division of the

05:21.995 --> 05:25.620
college. At that time, there were two years high 
school, two years college, and I was still working

05:25.640 --> 05:35.313
in the high school area at about that time. And was 
that East Central State? Was it Ada? Yes, East

05:37.776 --> 05:44.445
Central State College at Ada.

05:44.465 --> 05:45.887
At that time, I had started into majoring in 
biology, by the way, at Southeastern in Durand,

05:47.504 --> 06:01.125
but when I moved to Ada, I found no satisfactory 
teacher there, so I shifted to industrial arts.

06:05.432 --> 06:06.914
Played football and tennis. This was the biggest 
part of my college career there.

06:19.330 --> 06:29.903
19 and 22, prior to the time I graduated from 
college, I took my first teaching job at

06:19.330 --> 06:29.903
Tishomingo, Oklahoma. Believe it or not, at 19 
years old, I was principal of the high school,

06:29.963 --> 06:43.859
coach of athletics, taught all the industrial 
arts and whatever else was left over, including

06:29.963 --> 06:43.859
artistry. That's how I got introduced to 
teaching. It was quite a teaching load. It was

06:49.429 --> 06:52.873
quite a teaching load. How big a school was that? A 
small town, Tishomingo,

06:55.356 --> 07:05.689
Oklahoma, not very far from College of Eden. I 
spent that year, 22, 23, teaching there.

07:15.389 --> 07:19.254
Then you interrupted your college education for a 
year. Yes, I interrupted my college education for

07:19.274 --> 07:31.571
a year and

07:19.274 --> 07:31.571
then went back and swore I'd never teach another 
day. I got back to East Central College and the

07:31.591 --> 07:44.468
president offered me a student job, a half-time 
job. I got my bachelor's degree there in

07:46.372 --> 07:54.503
industrial arts and biology in 1924. That's kind 
of an odd combination, isn't it? No, it fits very

07:59.829 --> 08:00.971
well. I'm still with both of them. Well, I 
shouldn't say odd. I guess maybe what I would

08:06.498 --> 08:10.303
change that to. Well, unusual also sounds odd. But 
I mean, I would say not very many people would put

08:13.623 --> 08:23.900
together biology and industrial arts, I would

08:13.623 --> 08:23.900
say. I'm not sure that I did it intentionally. I 
think it was just simply a matter of taking

08:28.068 --> 08:36.342
advantage of whatever opportunities came along. 
to get what I wanted. From what you said earlier, I

08:39.927 --> 08:43.612
would guess that biology was your first love. 
Biology was the first love, but I lost that

08:43.632 --> 08:46.817
teacher. But when I came back after teaching a year 
at Tishomingo, I found an excellent biology

08:46.837 --> 08:56.451
teacher had been hired by the college. And, of 
course, I went right back to

08:56.811 --> 09:04.422
the biology end of it. but I carried the other also 
because I did like it. I didn't like the teaching. I

09:10.251 --> 09:19.723
didn't like the industrial arts teaching,

09:10.251 --> 09:19.723
but I did like the biology. One matter to back up 
just a little bit on your mother. Was she a native

09:22.547 --> 09:24.369
Texan? Yes, her people were farmers. I know very 
little about them. I never met my grandparents.

09:37.595 --> 09:55.499
but my mother was adopted by a Waxahachie family 
and I knew this family and thought of her adopted

09:37.595 --> 09:55.499
parents as uncle and aunt. He happened to be the 
sheriff of Ellis County at that time and was a top

10:00.848 --> 10:07.899
man, lived in a big Victorian house,

10:00.848 --> 10:07.899
a real beautiful place.

10:12.606 --> 10:17.834
So that was her upbringing.

10:17.874 --> 10:19.617
Her family Her mother and her father, I never knew 
because they died early apparently. She was

10:26.150 --> 10:34.973
adopted by this, the Ryburn family, Jim Ryburn

10:26.150 --> 10:34.973
was the name. You mentioned earlier that your last 
year of college you were doing some part-time

10:35.273 --> 10:42.384
teaching in the college. Yes, it was an industrial 
arts and not in the college but in the model school

10:42.404 --> 10:49.435
attached to the college. I had charge of the little 
rough ends and all of it.

10:58.869 --> 11:01.433
Was the model school for a full eleven years or 
twelve years, however many years they had in a

11:01.987 --> 11:07.215
public school? Yes, it had at least two years of 
high school in it, and I was teaching high school

11:07.455 --> 11:18.612
grade students at that time.

11:21.308 --> 11:27.073
Then you stayed on at the Central State for a good 
long while, didn't you? Yes. After I graduated, I

11:28.715 --> 11:44.390
was offered a job to teach biology and I became a 
full-time biology teacher first year of the

11:28.715 --> 11:44.390
graduate. This was in, let's see, I got my 
bachelor's degree in 1924. I taught the next year

11:51.667 --> 11:55.772
24, 25 and 26, 27. The

11:56.733 --> 12:17.240
following year I took leave of absence, went to the 
University of Illinois to study biology under

11:56.733 --> 12:17.240
Henry Baldwin Ward at Illinois. It's the same man 
Under him, Dr.

12:19.898 --> 12:26.991
Hopkins worked. Did you choose Illinois because 
of Dr. Ward? Yes, specifically because that was an

12:29.656 --> 12:35.707
area that I was interested in. I chose, I chose him 
rather than the institution. What was his area,

12:39.995 --> 12:43.662
you mean because of the area of biology he was in? 
Yes, he was one of the famous parasitologists of

12:44.232 --> 12:53.841
the nation in those early days.

12:57.925 --> 13:02.670
So I went to the University of Illinois.

13:02.690 --> 13:14.121
I worked out a master's degree and eight hours of 
undergraduate work that the dean fined me in nine

13:02.690 --> 13:14.121
months and got a master's degree in So that was a 
pretty busy year for you, I would imagine. Nine

13:22.245 --> 13:27.832
months to take some undergraduate courses, plus 
enough for a master's. The only thing that

13:27.872 --> 13:30.515
bothered me was this undergraduate work. It was 
all in German.

13:36.343 --> 13:42.150
Henry Baldwin was a product of the Prussian school 
of of teachers, and he was a driver. And

13:50.136 --> 13:59.465
he said, well, if you're going to have to take 
undergraduate work, do something that'll do you

13:50.136 --> 13:59.465
some good. So he made me take German, which was 
about as rough as you would have picked. It's

14:06.271 --> 14:07.433
pretty rough, yes. I remember from the smattering 
of German I've had. Did you then, after you

14:13.079 --> 14:17.744
received your master's, went back to Ada? I 
returned to Ada and taught in the college. At the

14:24.332 --> 14:27.115
time, I think I was an assistant professor. In

14:27.135 --> 14:33.042
a couple of years, I was full professor. I went back 
to the University of Illinois at Dr. Ward's

14:33.062 --> 14:39.330
invitation. He gave me an assistantship. in 1929, 
just in time for the stock crash,

14:43.437 --> 14:55.652
which helped me a great deal because I'd saved some 
money. I mean, this money turned out to be twice as

14:55.672 --> 15:04.863
much under the Depression days as it would have 
been before. So,

15:05.964 --> 15:12.752
to me, the Depression was Just an episode that 
actually was a help in getting through.

15:21.536 --> 15:40.579
I was there at Illinois working on my doctorate and 
took some marine work at the University of

15:21.536 --> 15:40.579
Washington Seattle in the summer and got my PhD in 
1933.

15:42.179 --> 15:44.783
Was that working under Dr. Ward? Working under Dr. 
Ward. I never found the course work difficult. In

15:52.894 --> 16:01.126
fact, I don't think I made one B in all of the 
biological science that I took. The main reason

16:01.146 --> 16:05.132
was that

16:09.280 --> 16:17.691
In some areas, I was considerably better than my 
teachers because I'd had more field experience. I

16:17.711 --> 16:24.700
admitted to the state of my boyhood, I spent mostly 
in the woods and fields and so on. That was the thing

16:24.720 --> 16:26.562
that I did.

16:29.386 --> 16:34.933
Especially when we were still back at Durant, we 
were I spent

16:35.504 --> 16:47.899
nearly all of my time in the woods, and I knew a great 
deal about it. Whether I had much reading there, I

16:48.360 --> 16:51.163
don't know. When I went to the University of 
Illinois, I found most of the courses were fairly

16:51.984 --> 16:57.711
simple. I didn't have much trouble. Teaching at, 
in Ada, in East Central State, did you have to teach

17:02.065 --> 17:10.424
in the summers most of the time too? Yes, I taught 
the entire year. So you didn't have any summers off

17:13.952 --> 17:16.918
for research or anything like that? No, but I did. 
You understand that at that time, research was not

17:21.725 --> 17:26.990
looked upon with favor. I did my research on my own, 
paid for it all, and I took trips every August. I had

17:35.798 --> 17:40.323
a vacation in August after the summer term had been 
closed. And I arranged over a good portion of the

17:41.584 --> 17:49.251
United States during those summer periods. I was

17:50.935 --> 18:11.509
doing research back there at a time when the 
administration of the college just assumed I

17:50.935 --> 18:11.509
didn't do it.

18:22.846 --> 18:27.398
How many hours of teaching load did you carry 
during the time? I imagine it varied from time to

18:28.340 --> 18:36.180
time between 24 and 42, but just for some idea of 
perspective, I have some idea of how many. what

18:36.818 --> 18:37.860
your load was? Well, it was at least twice to three 
times what I have here.

18:45.454 --> 18:56.935
Anyway, there was no time given off for anything 
except when I taught a course in biology, it was

18:45.454 --> 18:56.935
usually a five-hour course. There would be four 
laboratory hours a week and three lecture hours a

19:00.899 --> 19:15.092
week and I would teach at least two courses at a time 
and sometimes three.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.914
You probably had to change your own labs too, I 
think. Oh yeah, I did all of the laboratory work,

19:18.275 --> 19:23.960
getting out specimens and everything of that 
kind. No such thing as an assistant.

19:28.023 --> 19:29.865
I didn't mind that. I would rather do it. I know that 
you left the school at 842 during the war. Was that,

19:40.153 --> 19:44.521
was it because of the war that you left or? Yeah 
sometime in the 30s, late 30s,

19:44.541 --> 19:57.602
the president called me in and he says you're our 
new ground school instructor.

19:59.827 --> 20:04.595
I said, what do you mean, ground school 
instructor? He says, the

20:04.615 --> 20:15.392
flying school that we have here for students. 
You'll remember that before World War II, the

20:15.412 --> 20:25.007
country was engaged in developing as many pilots 
as we could. and the government subsidized nearly

20:25.460 --> 20:39.165
every school in the United States, I guess, to 
teach people how to fly, students how to fly.

20:40.107 --> 20:45.595
I've forgotten the name of that program, the 
Civilian Pilot Training Program. That's the name

20:45.615 --> 20:48.239
of it. And I didn't know a thing about it, of course. 
He called me in, but he said that I was it because the

20:51.544 --> 21:02.520
man that we had had accepted a job with the 
government and would no longer be available. I

21:04.289 --> 21:07.032
argued that I didn't know anything about it. How 
could I do it? He said, you go do it. So I did. I bought

21:11.696 --> 21:32.136
me a bunch of books and

21:11.696 --> 21:32.136
boned up on them and went up to Oklahoma City and 
took examinations

21:11.696 --> 21:32.136
and all of the ground school subjects that they 
needed, which was Meteorology and aircraft,

21:33.044 --> 21:47.991
parachutes, navigation,

21:33.044 --> 21:47.991
aircraft engines.

21:48.011 --> 21:49.133
I believe that's all. No, civil air regulations. 
These are the things I had to have in order to teach.

21:58.897 --> 22:03.683
So I started teaching and keeping ahead of my 
students.

22:07.068 --> 22:11.093
So I had all of these, I had a teacher's license. 
When World War II broke out, I was licensed for all

22:11.994 --> 22:16.360
of those. Not only that, by that time I was a pilot on 
my own and had a civilian pilot license and owned my

22:16.480 --> 22:25.933
own airplane. So when World War II broke out, the 
Navy sent me a telegram asking me to help with the

22:27.483 --> 22:38.526
war effort, so I did. Simple as that. I taught 
navigation most of it.

22:48.290 --> 22:51.834
I believe you taught that in both Norman in 
Oklahoma and in Dallas. Yes, Dallas Naval Air

22:52.435 --> 22:55.158
Station. That's just west of Dallas, actually, at 
Grand Prairie. And then later they moved me up to

23:02.467 --> 23:07.613
Oklahoma at Norman.

23:08.695 --> 23:17.385
This I liked because I knew most of the people at the 
University of Oklahoma at Norman, and I set up a

23:08.695 --> 23:17.385
liaison with them. By the time I got up there, I was 
hankering to get back to biology. Well, they gave

23:25.476 --> 23:38.114
me a research room on the campus and all the 
microscopes and whatever I wanted to do a little

23:25.476 --> 23:38.114
research on the site. And that's what I did. No 
official connections or anything, but I worked

23:40.838 --> 23:48.148
with them. After that, somewhere I believe in 
1944,

23:49.597 --> 24:14.169
we got to the place where we had enough Navy 
instructors standing around doing nothing that I

23:49.597 --> 24:14.169
felt like I could turn the job over to somebody else 
and go back to biology. Dr. Weiss at that time Dean

24:19.904 --> 24:30.661
of the Graduate School at Norman, University of 
Oklahoma, called me one day and said he had a

24:19.904 --> 24:30.661
research job

24:19.904 --> 24:30.661
for me. He said, I want to take it. So I went to see him 
and it happened to be a job with the College of

24:32.665 --> 24:43.903
William & Mary and the Virginia Fisheries.

24:45.757 --> 24:46.738
department. These two were working together and 
running a laboratory at Yorktown.

24:58.008 --> 25:04.313
The job was a study of the rib muscles on the seaside 
of Virginia.

25:07.096 --> 25:14.262
The man who had been doing this job, Dr. Moore, got a 
job at New Hampshire, I believe. and I took his

25:14.478 --> 25:20.524
place to finish up a project that had already 
begun. Is this Ribbed Muscle? Ribbed,

25:22.326 --> 25:26.951
R-I-B-B-E-D, Ribbed Muscle Modulus Domicilis. 
It's a very common one all around the country. He

25:31.456 --> 25:34.479
might be interested in what they were doing with 
these things. During World War II, We lost our

25:39.436 --> 25:47.438
source of chicken feed and vitamins, especially 
fortified chicken feed. The Delmarva Peninsula,

25:47.458 --> 25:54.677
that's their big business, still is today, is 
raising chickens. But they got all of their

25:55.197 --> 25:59.683
vitamins from the Japs. Of course, we weren't 
speaking to the Japs at about that time. So they

26:07.094 --> 26:10.639
were looking for another source and they found it 
in these mussels. And the efforts were to culture

26:12.322 --> 26:22.977
this mussel in sufficient quantities to fill this 
need.

26:26.062 --> 26:38.401
In other words, I was still in the war effort to some 
extent, but actually working for the College of

26:26.062 --> 26:38.401
William & Mary, supported by Dow Chemical 
Company. Were you successful in cultivating the

26:38.421 --> 26:42.127
mussels? No, we never did figure out a way to 
culture the mussels or to speed up their

26:42.288 --> 26:52.103
development at all.

26:53.467 --> 26:56.743
That was being done by then with oysters, wasn't 
it? Or has that been a more recent development? The

26:59.963 --> 27:06.351
oysters, I don't think oysters have ever been used 
for vitamins. What I mean, what I think commonly

27:06.371 --> 27:15.122
called oyster farming, were they not doing that 
with oysters? Oh, farming oysters, yes. When I

27:19.307 --> 27:29.380
finished this project, which took me only through 
that first letter about nine months,

27:19.307 --> 27:29.380
I joined the...

27:32.330 --> 27:43.763
the College of William & Mary and the Virginia 
Fisher's Laboratory in the capacity of Director

27:32.330 --> 27:43.763
of Oyster Research. In other words, I just moved 
from Waxapraga on the seaside over to Yorktown and

27:44.824 --> 27:56.177
continued working with them for about another 
year. in the oyster culture area. This is where I

28:01.131 --> 28:09.540
was introduced to oysters, but all these mussels 
and the oyster reefs were all together. That year,

28:09.560 --> 28:24.915
with the mussels study, I lived in an old house 
right out on the edge of the water, and clear out of

28:09.560 --> 28:24.915
sight of everything. And I spent the entire winter 
in the field. That's all I did. I hardly ever inside

28:30.021 --> 28:32.123
at all. What spurred on my original question was I 
was wondering, maybe I'm mistaken in equating,

28:32.143 --> 28:46.140
not truly equating, but almost equating the 
technique that you would use with an oyster as

28:32.143 --> 28:46.140
opposed to one with a mussel. And I was wondering 
why oysters could be cultivated and not mussels.

28:53.549 --> 29:17.706
They have, I think, possibly the same problems, 
the disease problem, I think, as far as the muscles

28:53.549 --> 29:17.706
are concerned, but I don't know that because I 
never did actually get to study the muscles so far

28:53.549 --> 29:17.706
as their diseases were concerned. I didn't study 
the oysters either as long as I was at... at the

29:22.928 --> 29:41.899
Virginia Fisher's Laboratory, studying culture 
methods using the time-honored methods actually

29:22.928 --> 29:41.899
built up by the oyster, more than anything else, 
and attempting to improve on their methods.

29:45.743 --> 30:00.208
so I got my introduction anyway to oyster biology 
and oyster culture methods at the College of

29:45.743 --> 30:00.208
William & Mary.
