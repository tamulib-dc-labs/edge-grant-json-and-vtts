WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:07.064
I would say silver taps would be profitable. The 
strongest and along with that is musket. I think

00:11.188 --> 00:14.411
those are probably the two strongest. Here in 
Albuquerque, we have a big musket coming out every

00:14.431 --> 00:20.657
year. I think for the non-Aggie,

00:20.677 --> 00:30.347
it's something that's a very special tradition. 
Bonfire. I think that there's... such a feeling

00:33.646 --> 01:02.877
that

01:03.953 --> 01:13.241
Our view.

01:13.261 --> 01:13.802
This camp. This camp was not. I went, but I don't 
recall it being. Y'all practice. Y'all practice.

01:24.251 --> 01:24.891
Football games. Football games and falling out 
before the game. As I tell people, when you're

01:30.496 --> 01:33.859
standing there And you've seen all the outfits 
fall out. And then now, of course, you've got the

01:39.960 --> 01:42.223
cannon back then. But then you hear the cannon and 
all of a sudden the band starts playing there by

01:42.383 --> 01:49.252
Duncan. There's no experience I can think of any 
place that can come close to that. And

01:56.602 --> 01:58.044
commencement? Commencement? Probably not so 
much. I mean, getting commissions and everything

02:02.510 --> 02:04.673
was, put

02:04.990 --> 02:34.221
all these then together what is it about those that 
contribute to the creation of this Aggie spirit

02:04.990 --> 02:34.221
I think it's a uh...

02:36.277 --> 03:06.047
uh...

03:06.837 --> 03:12.468
emotional, and I think it's all of those things put 
together. It's having known that everybody has

03:12.488 --> 03:16.175
gone through that. And what's particularly, I 
think, gratifying

03:31.728 --> 03:44.870
And in all of these, do you agree with me, it didn't 
matter where you grew up, how much income your

03:31.728 --> 03:44.870
family produced, where you worshipped or whether 
you worshipped, what your major was, none of those

03:31.728 --> 03:44.870
mattered. It didn't matter. It was inclusive. 
It's still that way. I mean, if somebody calls me up

03:48.396 --> 03:57.090
and they're an Aggie and they need help with this or 
with that, you know, you don't even ask those

03:48.396 --> 03:57.090
questions. And just today I was looking on the, one 
of the websites and one of the bulletin boards, and

03:58.795 --> 04:03.379
they have a memorial service in Austin tonight. A 
guy posted a bulletin board, if anybody needs a

04:03.399 --> 04:15.430
place to stay, I've got a big old house, I'm by 
myself, bring your blanket and your pillow, and

04:03.399 --> 04:15.430
you're more than welcome to stay at my house. 
There's so many places. And it's hard to describe,

04:17.572 --> 04:27.621
even with this whole tragedy, it's been hard to 
describe to other people why it's affected that

04:17.572 --> 04:27.621
way. All right, let's talk about bonfire in your 
years. Did you work on the bonfire? Do you remember

04:33.748 --> 04:35.451
where the cutting area was? Did you go out and help 
cut? Oh, yeah. And back then, it was probably on the

04:40.561 --> 04:44.248
south side of the campus. Behind Duncan. As I 
recall, it seemed like the one in 69 was the one with

04:46.940 --> 04:51.126
the collar. I think you're right. When they 
stopped and capped it. Because they were

04:54.912 --> 04:56.995
concerned about the danger. And

04:57.055 --> 05:05.027
did you put in some long hours on the bonfire? Long 
hours. Do you remember any injuries during your

05:08.092 --> 05:10.616
years? And as I recall, there was very... safety 
conscious. You know, some of the, you know, this

05:19.000 --> 05:23.646
year, it's not that much fun. You're really doing a 
lot of the grunt work. But, I mean, that really is,

05:28.794 --> 05:32.159
that's a whole, just a whole script. I mean, 
there's something. Words can't describe, after

05:33.040 --> 05:44.436
all the work and effort you put into it, and the, 
again, the camaraderie that develops as you're

05:33.040 --> 05:44.436
doing that, the feeling when you see that response 
like that. let's see were there any black students

05:46.778 --> 06:14.254
in your core outfit and did you have any were you 
aware of any negative incidents involving black

05:46.778 --> 06:14.254
students

05:46.778 --> 06:14.254
we're getting near the end of this let's see we 
talked about what creates Aggie spirit

06:16.107 --> 06:19.170
As you look back, what did it mean to you? What has it 
meant to your life that you went to Texas A&M?

06:32.484 --> 06:40.692
I

06:32.484 --> 06:40.692
don't know. It's hard to describe that ongoing 
spirit.

06:57.063 --> 07:18.188
But I

06:57.063 --> 07:18.188
think there's

06:57.063 --> 07:18.188
just a lot of pride that

06:57.063 --> 07:18.188
goes into being associated with a school like 
that, and seeing those traditions continue. It's

07:18.208 --> 07:25.277
a proud moment when I was watching something on CNN 
the other day, and they were interviewing this

07:18.208 --> 07:25.277
young lady, and again, coming from the 
environment where there weren't a lot of female

07:18.208 --> 07:25.277
students there. And seeing a young lady, probably 
class of 2000, 2001, very eloquently describing

07:27.218 --> 07:33.790
what that spirit was all about. And in fact, when 
the interviewer kept trying to get her to say

07:33.810 --> 07:47.134
something bad, that made me feel good because it 
was like the younger generation had the same

07:33.810 --> 07:47.134
respect for the tradition.

07:58.066 --> 08:06.959
I was

07:58.066 --> 08:06.959
very disappointed. My son couldn't get in

08:07.119 --> 08:15.071
there. He actually grew up in Colorado with my 
ex-wife, and so coming in as an out-of-state

08:15.091 --> 08:21.581
student was very difficult. And looking at a lot of 
my friends' kids now, and they've just gotten out

08:21.601 --> 08:24.605
of it, and I feel bad that he wasn't able to have that 
experience. And actually, it's been

08:24.625 --> 08:27.229
interesting, because I've seen his experience at 
the New York

08:30.263 --> 08:54.482
right

08:30.263 --> 08:54.482
now

08:30.263 --> 08:54.482
this question is partly repetitive what did you 
learn at A&M that's been significant in your years

08:30.263 --> 08:54.482
after graduation I think

09:04.891 --> 09:19.553
I was

09:04.891 --> 09:19.553
not a very disciplined person

09:04.891 --> 09:19.553
before I came. I

09:19.573 --> 09:29.849
think it taught me a lot of disciplined things to 
learn about yourself. I truly think that a lot of

09:29.869 --> 09:32.073
those things helped me significantly as I went out 
in the business world. The way you treat other

09:32.093 --> 09:32.714
people. A lot of the I don't think there's

09:34.777 --> 09:53.865
any question that's

09:34.777 --> 09:53.865
had a huge impact.

10:03.802 --> 10:31.092
I think

10:03.802 --> 10:31.092
actually, I think this may have been one

10:03.802 --> 10:31.092
that I've seen where he talks about that.

10:33.873 --> 10:50.177
...

10:33.873 --> 10:50.177
... ...

10:33.873 --> 10:50.177
... ... ... Okay, there's three more points. First 
of those is let's make believe somebody walked in

10:55.318 --> 11:07.112
tomorrow and gave you a check for a million dollars 
cash with one restriction. You must give it to

11:07.132 --> 11:08.834
Texas A&M. Of what use would you want them to make 
that money? What would you want? If you could give a

11:17.485 --> 11:20.569
million dollars to A&M, what would you want done 
with it?

11:23.671 --> 11:45.979
Oh, I

11:23.671 --> 11:45.979
would probably,

11:23.671 --> 11:45.979
that's a great question. I would probably split a 
lot out of that amongst, I think a part of the

11:45.999 --> 11:48.042
athletic department, you know?

11:58.012 --> 12:10.407
What

11:58.012 --> 12:10.407
would you want them to spend it on? Probably on the 
scholarship.

12:18.997 --> 12:26.145
Rather than bricks and mortar, I think I'd rather 
see more kids be able to go and attend I'm on your

12:28.252 --> 12:30.095
side. Okay, next to last is a request from me. If you 
ever have any Aggie memorabilia, letters,

12:33.600 --> 12:50.063
documents, photos, or anything that you would be 
willing to part with, please put them in the A&M

12:33.600 --> 12:50.063
archives because then they would be preserved.

12:51.285 --> 12:53.027
Otherwise, they might get lost. And we will never 
have enough of that. And if we can get a large body of

12:55.652 --> 13:09.456
that material collected, then at some future 
date, we will have then a treasure that someone can

12:55.652 --> 13:09.456
explore and try to interpret as well as they can to 
help explain what this Aggie spirit. So what types

13:09.977 --> 13:12.501
of things are the letters and things? uh 
memorabilia if you had some some souvenirs or

13:12.650 --> 13:34.827
anything like that

13:12.650 --> 13:34.827
like one of the things that our son steve has that i 
want him sometime to pass on a lady gave him the

13:12.650 --> 13:34.827
tunic I think it was her great uncle who was one of 
the students that captured a longhorn that didn't

13:34.807 --> 13:48.441
have a name and branded it 13 to nothing. I think 
that tunic would probably be a special. He was one

13:52.966 --> 13:54.668
of those students. Okay, the last question. What 
feelings do you hold for Texas A&M in your heart

13:56.810 --> 14:00.814
now? now being postponed for just a few. You 
interpret it any way you

14:07.989 --> 14:13.514
want. It's hard to I wouldn't have wanted to have 
gone any

14:13.534 --> 14:23.965
other place.

14:28.789 --> 14:31.392
Better place that a parent could

14:32.941 --> 14:55.595
send their child not only to the

14:32.941 --> 14:55.595
academic portion of it, but mostly the learning 
experiences and the traditional. It's almost

14:55.615 --> 14:58.359
like any other university, there's, you know, you 
get the education part of it, but it ain't in the

14:55.615 --> 14:58.359
education part, you know. The aggie part of this 
here is not enough. and you know now

15:01.628 --> 15:24.442
I've been around the

15:01.628 --> 15:24.442
University of Oklahoma with my son, and certainly 
since we've been here we're very active with the

15:01.628 --> 15:24.442
University of New Mexico, but it's, there's a 
feeling of contempt, there's no contempt, and I

15:01.628 --> 15:24.442
think it really comes down to the tradition that, 
you know, it's so good. A friend told me, and I don't

15:24.462 --> 15:25.223
know

15:31.852 --> 15:45.810
And this friend of mine was

15:31.852 --> 15:45.810
very close to George, but then was very close to, I 
guess, George's white man, you know, Professor

15:31.852 --> 15:45.810
George. And he came up in a train trip when they 
first dedicated the library. And so they were

15:50.196 --> 15:56.644
riding back, and my friend asked President Bush's 
friend, why do you think George decided to go to the

15:50.196 --> 15:56.644
library there?

16:02.817 --> 16:20.033
All right.
