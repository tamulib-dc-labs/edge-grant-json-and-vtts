WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:04.296
I don't know. I do remember when we were getting 
ready for military review, inspection, and all of

00:04.396 --> 00:16.471
that in the springtime. And we were drilling out 
there across from Henderson Hall and the athletes

00:16.611 --> 00:25.362
were giving quite a bit of static to the Corps. And 
of course a lot of those guys were in there because

00:26.503 --> 00:32.350
of compulsory ROTC and the draft and everything 
else. It seems that night their swimming pool got

00:33.140 --> 00:44.702
blue and they needed to figure out who did it, but 
then they had to drain it and then scrape it and so

00:33.140 --> 00:44.702
they didn't get to use their pool. to some people 
was Good Bull. I didn't think that was Good Bull,

00:46.375 --> 00:49.140
but, uh, Ben loved the string. Did you have any idea 
as to who did it? I think I probably do if, uh, the

00:50.743 --> 01:02.724
guy, because I did get him to join the Century Club 
one time, so, uh, uh, it's amazing, too, uh, how

00:50.743 --> 01:02.724
much rank he got in the military, uh, but. What 
about, surely there was Good Bull in the dining

01:03.505 --> 01:05.909
hall? There was always Good Bull, you know, the, 
uh, Back in the dining hall, and you probably heard

01:07.953 --> 01:22.857
this from other people, but we had both Sabisa and 
Duncan, and there was always the duty officer had

01:07.953 --> 01:22.857
to sit at a little table with the officer of the day, 
the bull, as we referred to the military officer.

01:23.275 --> 01:38.179
And about once a year we would get a hare, as they'd 
say, and on the third wildcat, and I don't know what

01:23.275 --> 01:38.179
it would beat the hell out of with this or that or 
what, but the third wildcat, all the biscuits

01:23.275 --> 01:38.179
would come flying at the, at the military officer 
and then all hell would break loose and we'd get

01:38.547 --> 01:56.455
restricted and everything else but it was kind of 
like when I was back here and retired from the

01:38.547 --> 01:56.455
military working in the commandant's office and I 
called the Colonel Scott who's now deceased but

01:56.435 --> 02:20.923
his nickname was the goose and I asked Colonel 
Scott if he would come to a mini reunion we were

01:56.435 --> 02:20.923
having for the class 62 and Duncan and he said to me 
as serious as it could be they're not going to throw

01:56.435 --> 02:20.923
any of those deals at me again are they you know and 
so it is amazing some of the things you did which you

01:56.435 --> 02:20.923
thought was funny you know the of course there was 
always the killing deer and skinning them in the

02:20.903 --> 02:45.308
shower and things like that because people used to 
go out hunting and things like that, but Everybody

02:20.903 --> 02:45.308
knew somebody but a lot of times the guys that just 
go out there in the in the river bottom or out here

02:20.903 --> 02:45.308
mainly going towards Navasota and and we always 
had the the students that love to go out on the

02:45.845 --> 03:12.426
weekends and try to get snakes and other wildlife 
and it's always fun the getting the armadillos and

02:45.845 --> 03:12.426
painting them up and turning them loose in fact I 
guess it was about 72 when the University of Texas

02:45.845 --> 03:12.426
is a joke the students voted to change their name to 
the armadillo and the diggum dillas and then at the

02:45.845 --> 03:12.426
football game in Kyle Field all those maroon and 
white armadillos got released during the

02:45.845 --> 03:12.426
halftime but Do you know anything about who it was 
that caught those? No, wouldn't know anything

03:15.774 --> 03:17.977
about that. No, I really don't, but I can remember 
not only did they let them out on the field, but some

03:18.858 --> 03:26.607
of them got released in the stands. Were you back 
here then? No, no. Yes, yes, excuse me. I was

03:30.451 --> 03:32.213
working assistant commandant then. Did you have 
any idea that it was going to happen? No, oh no,

03:35.937 --> 03:37.599
didn't know. All we remember, we had the little 
bumper sticker that the Aggies were giving them

03:40.553 --> 03:45.459
out that said, dig them dillas, and trying to make 
fun of Texas. Had a lot of things happen, though. I

03:47.182 --> 03:54.471
think I remember, of course, a lot more when I 
worked in the Commandant's office from 70-74 than

03:47.182 --> 03:54.471
I did as a student. You know, you remember such 
things as one morning Colonel Parsons and I got a

03:54.752 --> 04:05.886
call to come over to the, and I don't know if we 
covered this the last time, but Colonel Parsons

03:54.752 --> 04:05.886
and I got called over to the quad and it seems that 
this Texas Ranger was trying to find out who had

04:12.042 --> 04:38.623
kidnapped Bevo and Bevo had been there earlier and 
I think John Adams does admit in his book that it was

04:12.042 --> 04:38.623
his squadron that he was CEO of but the thing I 
remember more than anything about that morning

04:12.042 --> 04:38.623
was the Texas Ranger had both Colonel Parsons and I 
he had our attention because he was talking about

04:12.042 --> 04:38.623
the penalty for cattle rustling and what it could 
do to these kids and of course what we were more

04:12.042 --> 04:38.623
interested in is you know You don't want a kid doing 
this so-called good bull. You don't want him

04:41.747 --> 04:43.168
getting into trouble. And sure enough, one of the 
cadets there spoke up and said, well, Mr. Ranger,

04:43.288 --> 04:52.519
sir, I'm sure we can help you. We don't want 
anything to happen to that animal either. And all

04:54.781 --> 05:01.589
of a sudden, the ranger slowed up just a little bit 
because the kid was very nicely threatening the

04:54.781 --> 05:01.589
ranger. If you want Bevo back, you better change 
your tone. As you recall, how was the return of

05:04.675 --> 05:09.715
Bevo? How did it come about? I think that there was 
just some kind of agreement that came out of that,

05:12.269 --> 05:21.080
and then the disciplinary action would be handled 
here at the campus. And I can't remember what

05:21.921 --> 05:26.246
actually happened. Larry Williams was the person 
working discipline then in the Commandant's

05:26.366 --> 05:32.674
office, but I don't think it amounted to anything. 
John Adams would definitely be able to tell you on

05:33.474 --> 05:36.798
that. Somebody, and I've forgotten who it was that 
I interviewed, was a part of the group coming back

05:40.130 --> 06:02.228
from Austin with them and they had a flat and a 
highway patrolman stopped and he said this

05:40.130 --> 06:02.228
interviewee said that in hindsight he felt 
certain that the highway patrolman was aware of

05:40.130 --> 06:02.228
what was going on but he helped them get their flat 
fixed. Well you know there was the one time when

06:03.029 --> 06:05.293
they A&M stole Bevo and rented a trailer over in 
Austin, which wasn't too smart to you all. We had

06:12.555 --> 06:28.834
another one one morning when we got called over to 
Dorm 9, which was the band dorm, and somebody had

06:12.555 --> 06:28.834
filled all of the commodes on one end with cement in 
them, and thank goodness it wasn't quick drying.

06:28.814 --> 06:37.005
We were able to get the physical plant over there, 
but this is just one of those typical games between

06:28.814 --> 06:37.005
one of the core units and the band. But this is 
usually not what you call good bull when it starts

06:38.167 --> 06:43.474
running into money like that. As you think back 
about all of the pranks that we would call good

06:44.055 --> 06:55.311
bull, do you remember any that resulted in real 
damage that cost money or physical? In the dining

06:59.494 --> 07:00.356
hall. There have been sometimes when they've had 
food fights that really would cause a lot of

07:00.697 --> 07:08.459
expense. I can remember I guess it was the early 70, 
70, 71 when we had one and then the outfits had to pay

07:11.930 --> 07:29.874
for the cash register which completely got ruined 
and you know it could really get carried away with

07:11.930 --> 07:29.874
just like water fights all of a sudden is what it 
would seem like it turned into. During your

07:30.976 --> 07:35.001
student days of the campus organization, other 
than the Corps, which ones do you think were held in

07:36.247 --> 07:47.556
the highest regard, like the band, MSC 
activities, singing cadets, and so forth? Well, I

07:49.325 --> 08:03.232
think the singing cadets, definitely, if you're 
talking about being respected by the student

07:49.325 --> 08:03.232
body, back in my days, we had a lot of the kids in the 
Corps that were in the singing cadets. And now it's

08:03.252 --> 08:12.109
very, very tough for a young man to be in the singing 
cadets because you're away from the Corps and

08:03.252 --> 08:12.109
there's just not... I don't know, I would 
guesstimate there might not be but three or four in

08:12.511 --> 08:16.577
there to start with. So I don't see the singing 
cadets now having that recognition and praise

08:17.278 --> 08:24.769
that they deserve. I've often wondered why can't 
the young men and women in the Corps especially

08:24.809 --> 08:38.248
strive to have more students involved in, more 
Corps students involved in the student

08:38.617 --> 09:08.320
government the singing cadets or you could just go 
right on into some of the vocal groups women's

08:38.617 --> 09:08.320
choir or others you know but I think I think the MSC 
was very very well respected and I think also our

08:38.617 --> 09:08.320
the rodeo club was in my days was was very respected 
in because we had a lot of students majoring in

08:38.617 --> 09:08.320
agriculture and silence sirloin this but now I 
don't know that you hear much about the What did you

09:08.435 --> 09:15.229
and your buddies, when you were an undergraduate, 
what did you and your buddies really think about

09:08.435 --> 09:15.229
the band? Oh, I think we started off being 
brainwashed. If you weren't in the band, you know,

09:18.014 --> 09:29.818
we'd be in the dining hall, and then they'd say, 
beat the hell out of the Air Force, and the Army

09:18.014 --> 09:29.818
would jump up, and then beat the hell out of the Army 
and the Air Force, and then somebody would say,

09:18.014 --> 09:29.818
beat the hell out of the band, and everybody except 
the band would jump up. And they made fun of the

09:30.406 --> 09:49.613
band, but I think really when you get down to it, you 
really respected them because they weren't your

09:30.406 --> 09:49.613
typical high school band students that you tend to 
remember from, especially a small high school,

09:30.406 --> 09:49.613
because most of them would always tend to dominate 
a lot of the intramural sports, which in my days,

09:49.711 --> 10:01.857
probably the most important thing was who was the 
Class A champion or the Class B champion in sports.

10:03.300 --> 10:08.952
And in the intramurals in your day, name the 
various sports you can recall. Well, I ended up

10:09.235 --> 10:14.606
living intramurals and ended up being senior 
intramural manager. But I think that the

10:14.987 --> 10:21.000
important thing back then The points for the flag, 
whether you were civilian or were you a freshman or

10:21.436 --> 10:34.751
you were upperclassmen corps, intramural flag 
was probably the most important thing and points

10:21.436 --> 10:34.751
for General Moore intramurals had a good portion 
of the total points system. And ping pong counted

10:35.632 --> 10:39.116
just as much as flag football. Our softball in our 
days it was fast pitch softball and there were some

10:39.317 --> 10:44.963
tremendous athletes. We had a lot of people, for an 
example, that were not, when they came here, were

10:44.943 --> 10:53.240
small or were not big enough to play varsity 
sports. But after about three years of eating in

10:53.301 --> 11:01.197
Sabisa and dunking and working out all the time, 
they were tremendous athletes. We played

11:01.177 --> 11:09.010
basketball, we had ping pong, we had horseshoes, 
we had volleyball, we had tennis. Our track was

11:09.691 --> 11:12.736
more of an open track. I remember right it didn't 
count for the intramural points, but we had open

11:12.836 --> 11:18.325
golf. But your ping pong, tennis, football, 
basketball, bowling counted also just as much.

11:24.515 --> 11:30.063
And each outfit in the corps or the civilian dorms 
had an athletic officer, athletic sergeant. And

11:30.083 --> 11:35.089
you did not cancel or fail to show up for a match. As 
you look back on that, what was significant in the

11:35.871 --> 11:44.262
long run for the young participants in 
intramurals? Well, I think probably what was the

11:45.119 --> 11:50.767
long run, it was important. I know when I came back 
here, and had been here for a good while, and who you

11:50.807 --> 12:07.549
know, Dean Adams out at the vet school, came up to me 
one night at a reception, and one of the first

11:50.807 --> 12:07.549
things he said, I was a Junior in the outfit when he 
was freshman, and he was real good at that fact he

12:07.529 --> 12:34.532
won the intramurals high hurdle and But he came to 
me He said but did you know we won class a football

12:07.529 --> 12:34.532
the year you left and I said I didn't know they had 
now here's a very distinguished professor and

12:07.529 --> 12:34.532
everything but he knew what was important back 
then and I think that might be a little bit of an

12:07.529 --> 12:34.532
example it taught us two or three things it taught 
us of course winnings important, but We also

12:34.512 --> 12:39.759
learned how to lose, but even more, most of these 
were team efforts. And you had to practice, and

12:39.819 --> 12:45.486
intramurals were probably more important than 
anything. You got away from the so-called core

12:45.546 --> 12:50.273
crap or the class crap when you got out there. Most 
of the people that came out in the outfits,

12:51.014 --> 12:55.860
especially upperclassmen, worked with the 
underclassmen. It was a time to be just a... relive

13:00.466 --> 13:02.069
those high school days. And again, a lot of the kids 
that played intramurals were not able to play in

13:02.310 --> 13:10.505
the 4A schools, which were the largest back then, 
but they got down here and they were studs. Of all of

13:12.229 --> 13:21.867
the individual student offices or positions, 
which ones had the highest prestige when you were

13:12.229 --> 13:21.867
an Aggie undergraduate? I think speaking from the 
Corps, company commander was the most

13:22.336 --> 13:35.303
prestigious position you could have, even though 
a lot of people say, well, you're on staff or you're

13:22.336 --> 13:35.303
Corps commander. But a lot of people say, well, if 
you can't be Corps commander, you can do more good

13:35.323 --> 13:41.897
being the company commander because you are the 
boss. And you have a chance to influence a lot of

13:42.130 --> 13:44.873
people. So I think from around the campus, if you 
ask, in my days, we had a lot of students here. We

13:55.024 --> 13:56.686
probably had 7,000 students. And when you think 
that you only have 72 coming into the RVs each year,

13:56.786 --> 14:05.476
that's a small portion of the student body. So it 
was a respected, but not now like it is where a good

14:08.219 --> 14:13.696
portion of that junior class is going to be in the 
RVs. And being Corps commander had more prestige

14:13.997 --> 14:20.878
than being student body president. Oh, I think so. 
I think so. I think you can just look at today and see

14:22.378 --> 14:27.106
the commandant of cadets, you know. I mean, when 
you look at salary range, what the person makes and

14:27.206 --> 14:38.926
everything, but the person that comes in here, 
that is a very respected position, and it brings a

14:27.206 --> 14:38.926
lot of benefits with it. Were you aware when you 
were a student that secret fraternities existed?

14:44.737 --> 14:49.463
I'd heard it, but I didn't know anything about it. 
Had you heard that there was one or more than one?

14:53.268 --> 14:53.788
Just one. And of course, over the years, you hear 
about everything from the TTs to the sticks and all

14:53.809 --> 15:01.438
of that. I can truthfully say that I... didn't 
believe it, you know, and as a student, you know,

15:05.223 --> 15:20.806
the mole men were another group you heard 
mentioned, but then as years go on and you come back

15:05.223 --> 15:20.806
here, you find out that, hey, maybe this did exist, 
you know. Turn it back on. Okay. Home for you... It

15:27.736 --> 15:32.063
was Jacksboro, Texas, which was... How did you get 
to and from Jacksboro? I hitchhiked the entire

15:32.083 --> 15:33.525
time. And normally that took about how long? 
Normally, normally I would say you would leave

15:36.884 --> 15:54.004
here, you could plan on six hours roughly, 
although sometimes it took a lot longer and I can

15:36.884 --> 15:54.004
only remember one time being picked up and the 
entire trip without having to get out. You made a

15:55.345 --> 15:56.466
non-stop? Non-stop one time, yeah. But I will tell 
you, though, Haskell, that the interesting

15:58.278 --> 16:06.891
thing, though, back then, even though 
hitchhiking, though, we all talked like we

15:58.278 --> 16:06.891
hitchhiked more than we really did. We had 
hometown clubs. We were very active in them. And

16:10.516 --> 16:20.851
the people from Jacksboro, we tended to belong to 
Wichita Falls because anybody going to Wichita

16:10.516 --> 16:20.851
Falls had to go through Jacksboro, basically. 
Now, if you shared a ride with somebody else in the

16:20.871 --> 16:27.441
car, was it... known from the beginning that 
everybody would share in paying for the gas? I

16:32.803 --> 16:46.476
think it I think it depended on who the 
upperclassmen was and if they had if they had money

16:32.803 --> 16:46.476
some of them would hustle rides for that and then 
there were others that would not charge you you

16:32.803 --> 16:46.476
know and especially if you were a freshman It was 
customary, you know, you get 15 miles off campus, I

16:46.945 --> 16:53.371
believe it was 15 miles, then you dropped handles. 
Well, I'll never forget, there was one guy that was

16:53.511 --> 17:07.063
head yell leader for a while my freshman year, 
Smokey Hyde, and then Smokey got relieved, but

16:53.511 --> 17:07.063
Smokey wouldn't drop handles, you know. You 
caught your ride out at Eastgate from here? If you

17:10.046 --> 17:16.952
were hitchhiking, yes, you'd go out to Eastgate, 
and then we, of course, just like the old story,

17:10.046 --> 17:16.952
you'd get in line, The problem that we had, being 
from Jacksboro, and there were five of us, and one

17:16.932 --> 17:33.422
had a car, but if we were going, we'd have to go from 
Waco to Stephenville on Highway 6, go that way, or

17:16.932 --> 17:33.422
really to HICO. And then six cuts off, we'd go on up 
281 to Stephenville. But you get out in that part of

17:37.604 --> 17:42.809
that open country and it becomes night, it's hard 
to catch a ride. But if you went to Fort Worth, then

17:42.849 --> 17:53.258
you'd get out and you'd have to get out to the 
Jacksboro Highway, which meant lots of times

17:42.849 --> 17:53.258
you'd have to carry your bag for about a mile, mile 
and a half, just walk across there. And how did you

17:54.659 --> 18:00.244
learn where was the best place to get the ride in 
Fort Worth? Well, yeah, well, get out on the... get

18:03.558 --> 18:05.141
out on the Jack Sparrow Highway. That was just the 
normal pass down. As you say word of mouth,

18:09.468 --> 18:11.331
somebody would tell you what to do. But the biggest 
problem that you had was if you ever tried to

18:11.792 --> 18:17.381
hitchhike and not wear your uniform. Because if 
you wore your uniform, and we all had the old

18:17.401 --> 18:25.414
suitcase with the block T, as they say on it, and 
people pick you up and Now, you might end up in that

18:25.529 --> 18:29.100
240 miles with 10 rides. You know, that's because 
an old farmer will see you. You know, and they stop

18:32.190 --> 18:33.374
and carry you. You may be just going 10 miles down 
the way. All right, share with the machine some.

18:39.063 --> 19:04.682
some hitchhiking stories funny serious well we uh 
we'd laugh a lot today you know sometimes you uh you

18:39.063 --> 19:04.682
might get picked up in a in a new cadillac and then 
the next thing you know the next car you're riding

18:39.063 --> 19:04.682
in the back of an old truck the problem is sometimes 
it's pretty darn hot or pretty darn cool

18:39.063 --> 19:04.682
especially if you're trying to get back in the fall 
for a hometown football game. We had drill on

19:05.953 --> 19:08.376
Saturdays, so it made it pretty rough. It had to be 
something special, so you had that opportunity to

19:09.097 --> 19:13.042
go home. So you didn't go home very much, but

19:13.062 --> 19:26.420
I guess only one time in the five years I was in 
college I ever rode with somebody where I was about

19:13.062 --> 19:26.420
halfway scared. You know, just kind of a weird, 
weird person. Were they driving too fast? No, no,

19:31.907 --> 19:36.496
you just thought something was a little strange 
about this person, you know. And then you didn't

19:37.037 --> 19:48.017
worry about the people that were picking you up 
just like they didn't worry really about the

19:37.037 --> 19:48.017
people they were picking up, especially if we had 
uniforms on, you know, and everybody... Some of

19:47.997 --> 20:04.919
the stories you'd be you know, whether you in the 
military, but most of them in Texas and you because

19:47.997 --> 20:04.919
from From here to Waco for an example You didn't 
have a lot of people that didn't know about Texas

19:47.997 --> 20:04.919
A&M driving on on highway 6 You threw a lot of rocks 
at fence posts. So Gary Halter and I have thrown a

20:04.939 --> 20:17.295
lot of rocks at fence posts together Oh,

20:04.939 --> 20:17.295
yes, I mean at times I There's a couple of times when 
you're coming back and you'd pull into what was

20:17.866 --> 20:22.301
East Gate. Back then you could see Dorm 1 and Dorm 2 
and in conversation they'd usually ask, where do

20:22.381 --> 20:28.382
you live? You just say over there and they'd drive 
over there and drop you off. And I've had people

20:32.392 --> 20:43.765
that were going out of their way when you 
especially get up in the North Texas area that

20:32.392 --> 20:43.765
would go 30 miles out of the way to drop you off there 
in your hometown. I've also been dropped off at

20:43.825 --> 20:56.800
Bowie when they were supposed to be going through 
Jacksboro and maybe they got into the cider

20:43.825 --> 20:56.800
somewhere and then, you know, you really get home 
late, you know. And how did you and your buddies get

20:57.674 --> 20:59.818
dates?

21:02.783 --> 21:18.450
Well, I think I can remember one episode that I'm 
sure a lot of people have told you about that go into

21:02.783 --> 21:18.450
my post office box and dear 5611, I'm 5611 and this 
was from Tessie and of course we had a court trip

21:02.783 --> 21:18.450
every year either TCU or SMU and A lot of blind dates 
and no telling how many marriages came about or

21:18.430 --> 21:27.363
marriages to their friends, but there were a lot of 
dates. Most of the time, somebody knew somebody in

21:27.843 --> 21:40.261
a dorm or a sorority, and we would have

21:27.843 --> 21:40.261
group parties in Austin or Huntsville or 
something like that. I know we had one my junior

21:40.361 --> 21:42.845
year. We had one freshman, Fish Duncan, Eddie 
Duncan had a blind date with Linda Bird Johnson.

21:48.453 --> 22:02.597
She was a senior in high school and

21:48.453 --> 22:02.597
that was an interesting time because again LBJ, 
all the way with LBJ was the slogan. In fact, I

22:02.617 --> 22:06.544
remember the Baylor game, my Baylor game. my 
junior year when we were playing, we were off the

22:07.672 --> 22:29.777
subject, but we were playing Baylor and Waco and 
this plane came over and dropped these leaflets

22:07.672 --> 22:29.777
and that's when Lyndon Johnson was running for 
both Vice President and Senator and the leaflets

22:07.672 --> 22:29.777
said, don't be half safe and you opened it up and it 
said, strike LBJ twice. But anyway, back on the

22:29.797 --> 22:34.202
blind dates, back on the blind dates, everybody 
either had a sister or their girlfriend wanted to

22:35.465 --> 22:59.937
fix somebody up and it was not hard to get a date from 
the standpoint of a weekend or something and

22:35.465 --> 22:59.937
because a lot of guys didn't want because so many 
guys didn't have any money you know they worked and

22:35.465 --> 22:59.937
and uh to come to school and so uh there was always 
the opportunity to have a date with someone this uh

23:00.355 --> 23:03.459
outfitmate that had the blind date with Linda 
Berg. Was this in Austin? It was in Austin. She was

23:06.904 --> 23:20.884
visiting a friend for the year ahead of her as a 
freshman in this sorority at Texas and so we ended

23:06.904 --> 23:20.884
up, we must have had 25, 30 guys go over there and had 
dates with sorority. We did this a lot to

23:20.924 --> 23:22.566
Huntsville. dorms, just different places. 
Houston, the nursing, there was always somebody

23:25.355 --> 23:34.783
that was going with a nurse at Houston, so if it was 
Rice or the Houston game, there'd be 15 of those

23:25.355 --> 23:34.783
nurses and What did this guy say about the date? You 
remember? Oh, Linda Berg? I don't know. What I do

23:40.317 --> 23:50.507
remember, which I don't know if it can be printed, 
but what was funny the next morning, or Monday

23:40.317 --> 23:50.507
morning, is the only time I've ever heard the term 
freshman fart off. You know, you did not make fun of

23:50.547 --> 23:52.750
freshmen. That was just, you could, upper class, 
now freshmen could, but one of the upperclassmen

23:52.770 --> 24:05.142
had a freshman go down and blow the whistle and 
said, fish Duncan went all the way with LBJ, you

23:52.770 --> 24:05.142
know. Which was not true, I know, but still. But we 
did have a lot of opportunities, no matter what.

24:15.751 --> 24:20.640
Now, the girls in College Station and Bryan, that 
was another story. Unless you happened to have a

24:20.720 --> 24:30.437
guy in your outfit that was going with one, and then 
that could open up the door to maybe have a date with

24:20.720 --> 24:30.437
a local girl. There weren't that many. There were 
not that many, and most of them did not even think

24:31.880 --> 24:39.893
about dating, unless they met them at church. And 
that was the best way for somebody to actually get

24:41.055 --> 24:49.290
to know good families and get to know... Did you go 
to church here? I went to the Methodist church here

24:49.310 --> 24:52.816
over A&M Methodist. Describe their...

24:56.557 --> 24:58.360
A&M student activity? Well, they had the MYL, and 
the problem that I had my freshman year, I was in

24:58.521 --> 25:08.939
dorm two, the other side of the campus, and I 
usually didn't go on Sunday night. I'd try to go

25:08.979 --> 25:09.841
Sunday. I came down here, started my freshman 
year, I had 12 years perfect attendance in Sunday

25:10.101 --> 25:17.755
school, so I did go to Sunday, didn't go to the... 
Down here as much as I should have, but again, I

25:17.735 --> 25:23.104
tried to go on Sunday mornings. But did you go on 
Sunday night much? Not much, mainly because of CQ

25:25.969 --> 25:34.364
and the dorm, and there were people like Bo that was 
a little more active in MYF and things. Was

25:35.666 --> 25:39.473
religious emphasis week still going here when you 
were a student? I've got to admit, I don't

25:39.790 --> 25:42.854
remember. I'll tell you, I think it was very 
interesting in the core of the outfits. I was in the

25:51.986 --> 26:00.556
pre-vet outfit, and I think we had a pretty strong 
Christian base in that outfit. Most of the people

26:00.637 --> 26:01.798
were were just really good people. Now some of the 
outfits were pretty crude, pretty raunchy, a lot

26:03.662 --> 26:13.003
of filth, and I think the unit that I was in the 
entire time Pretty darn clean cut. I can remember

26:14.642 --> 26:20.628
when I was a freshman, upperclassmen coming in and 
they had a raffle. And it went from one to a dollar.

26:24.572 --> 26:25.833
And the numbers one to a hundred. And if you won 
first prize, it was a trip to LaGrange. Second

26:28.976 --> 26:30.918
prize would be a fifth of scotch. So when you figure 
it out, those guys took in $50. And I'll never

26:33.160 --> 26:38.425
forget John Sullivan and Robert Davidson. They 
were from Galveston, next room. They made us all

26:40.027 --> 26:41.508
enter. And we were all hoping. and praying that we 
didn't get the LaGrange trip, you know, even

26:43.713 --> 26:49.294
though there were a lot of guys, or we'd go over 
there every weekend. But I remember,

26:49.334 --> 26:53.470
interesting, John Sullivan drew a one had to pay a 
penny and then they drew again and he got a two. So we

26:57.518 --> 27:00.121
still laugh about that today. In fact, John and his 
brother support the General Moore Award now to

27:00.141 --> 27:04.546
this day. But I think that

27:04.586 --> 27:16.420
we had a number of guys in my outfit that went to 
church and I always remember when I was having a

27:04.586 --> 27:16.420
problem as freshmen academically and everything 
else, and this sophomore who I thought was about

27:17.041 --> 27:28.373
halfway mean came in one night and knew I was having 
problems, and he started talking to me and said,

27:17.041 --> 27:28.373
well, have you considered praying about it? And 
then all of a sudden, you know, I'd been here about a

27:28.633 --> 27:34.640
month and a half, and then I saw this guy as human, 
you know. For the first month and a half, I hated

27:34.720 --> 27:38.364
every upperclassman, you know.

27:41.427 --> 27:46.052
If you had a date here on campus to a football game or 
something or other, Where did you and your buddies

27:46.522 --> 27:50.638
take your dates after that event? Well, most of the 
time there was not a lot of places to go out here to

27:51.542 --> 27:55.738
Franklin's. in my days you could go out to you could 
go out there you go to a movie the places like that

27:56.056 --> 28:20.140
but there just wasn't a lot of places to go out you 
know I guess if if you find the people that did drink

27:56.056 --> 28:20.140
a lot and went out and this and that they probably 
went to different places you know but there just

27:56.056 --> 28:20.140
wasn't a lot of wasn't a lot of places probably the 
most interesting place to go and you'd never take a

28:20.356 --> 28:26.487
date was to Guyon Hall to the movies here, you know, 
because of all the wisecracks, but. Yeah, as

28:28.330 --> 28:35.243
student indulgences, what were the folks you knew 
about, what were they drinking? Oh, most people

28:35.662 --> 28:38.065
when I was in school, it was beer. You know, every 
once in a while they'd talk about if you were having

28:38.246 --> 28:49.822
a big event or something, you'd go out here to 
Whiskey Bridge, to Jones Bridge, you know, and

28:38.246 --> 28:49.822
they'd buy something or get somebody to buy. But 
beer was the, and that was before the keg beer as

28:50.363 --> 28:54.469
such, you know. But beer seemed to be the drinking. 
What brands were they drinking? Well, there was

28:59.708 --> 29:06.015
definitely Jackson Pearl back then, you know, and 
you had Slits. Was Shiner popular? Shiner was, I

29:07.677 --> 29:11.321
never remember Shiner being popular here. Of 
course, it had its popularity in Texas and then

29:11.381 --> 29:15.546
later. But I've got to tell you, I'm probably the 
wrong guy to be talking to because I just went in the

29:16.267 --> 29:25.277
Dixie Chicken for the first time about two years 
ago for a chicken fried steak. And smoking, what

29:27.720 --> 29:29.462
were people smoking? I remember every outfit 
would have a guy that gave away the three little

29:31.231 --> 29:37.938
cartons of cigarettes, a little four or five to it. 
And I remember it seemed like Lucky Strikes and

29:38.058 --> 29:45.466
Camels were about the two I remember because I 
didn't smoke. And almost nobody smoked a pipe.

29:47.928 --> 29:58.099
There would be, it was a junior privilege to smoke a 
pipe in the mess hall, dining hall, but very few

29:47.928 --> 29:58.099
people did it, or a cigar. senior privilege. I 
can't remember if it was junior or senior, but it

29:59.399 --> 30:03.064
may have been a senior privilege. I believe it was a 
senior privilege to smoke a cigar in the dining

30:03.344 --> 30:15.300
hall, except on the very formal one night when all 
the waiters would sell cigars at the table. Even

30:15.360 --> 30:16.621
freshmen could smoke. And then didn't sometimes 
it, was it in a football game or at Yale practice

30:16.801 --> 30:21.167
that some group smoked cigars? It probably was. I 
don't remember that. Again, all of this kind of

30:26.882 --> 30:31.490
goes back to what outfits and did. I think if I 
remember right, it was a sophomore privilege

30:31.811 --> 30:41.187
either to chew gum on campus or maybe a junior 
privilege to smoke cigarettes on campus. Did you

30:41.949 --> 30:43.932
and your buddies even know the word marijuana no no 
no i know my first trip to vietnam is when i first

30:44.300 --> 31:06.645
started seeing problems with marijuana and that 
was in 66 and then when i went back in 68 i saw that

30:44.300 --> 31:06.645
heroin had become a serious problem with the young 
gis But I don't remember we remember you hear

31:06.625 --> 31:15.623
people talk about it, but I don't ever remember 
hearing anybody having problems in the 58 through

31:06.625 --> 31:15.623
60. I'm sure they did but I don't didn't know 
anybody
