WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:10.419
who were friends of his and they talked about 
things that they thought were important.

00:13.243 --> 00:17.289
We went to a couple of plays and things of that 
nature. I think that must have been the time we all

00:17.309 --> 00:25.741
stayed at the Shamrock Hotel in Houston that was 
near the medical center. But it was particularly

00:25.881 --> 00:30.308
nice and a very enjoyable trip. My wife and I went on 
that one time as, quote, faculty. And I remember

00:35.278 --> 00:39.805
Bob Sackowitz showing us how to pour wine. You pick 
up the wine bottle with your finger like this, and

00:41.507 --> 00:46.295
you pour the wine. And then you turn the wine bottle 
and lift it up, and you don't drip the wine. And we

00:51.196 --> 00:54.299
went to ballet and to a concert. And it was 
meaningful. Did you ever have, a few people shared

00:58.663 --> 01:12.256
with me, advisor conversations where they had not 
been doing their best, and some advisor got

00:58.663 --> 01:12.256
through to them in a special way. Did you ever have 
anybody kind of pick you off the floor? I don't

01:17.461 --> 01:18.181
think so. I don't think so. probably at times that I 
should have had that happen, but I don't remember

01:20.845 --> 01:35.555
anybody just, I don't remember anybody either 
chewing on me to do better, or the other side, I

01:20.845 --> 01:35.555
don't remember anybody saying, you know, you can 
do a lot better. I don't remember much

01:35.575 --> 01:37.679
encouragement either. You're pretty much on your 
own. All right, so... If we could get back all of the

01:40.690 --> 01:52.421
faculty, staff, counselors, and so forth that 
were there, are there any others that you haven't

01:40.690 --> 01:52.421
mentioned that you would like to be able to say 
thank you to? Oh, goodness. I'm sure there are. If I

01:55.163 --> 02:03.511
probably thought back about it, I could make a much 
longer list. The trouble with trying to recall

02:03.551 --> 02:10.697
something like this at this time is I would leave 
somebody out that I shouldn't. I

02:10.964 --> 02:18.399
worked, when I was a senior, I was editor of the 
Yearbook. And I worked with Lane Stevenson. And I

02:21.825 --> 02:24.931
always thought Lane was a much older, more mature 
guy. And I see him down there now. He was probably

02:25.993 --> 02:28.058
just a few years older than I was. He and I went to 
lunch Tuesday of this week. Good man, good man. But

02:34.520 --> 02:40.648
he was just starting out then, I think, and he was in 
the, he was the head of student publications.

02:41.249 --> 02:45.174
Describe, haven't had anybody yet who's been the 
yearbook editor. Describe what that involved.

02:49.720 --> 02:55.407
Not surprisingly, at A&M it was different than it 
was at that time than any other school in America.

02:56.609 --> 03:00.073
I'm sure that at every other, I went to a couple of 
workshops for a yearbook editor's article. And I

03:02.534 --> 03:11.462
probably learned nothing because all of the 
people who were in charge, who were editors, were

03:02.534 --> 03:11.462
journalism majors. And really, at A&M, it was less 
a journalistic function than a management

03:12.683 --> 03:21.932
function because all of the work was done by the 
court. And specifically, my outfit. My outfit had

03:26.216 --> 03:28.238
been historically the yearbook and outfit. In 
fact, I had a friend here in town who was 10 years

03:30.503 --> 03:37.311
ahead of me, class of 59, but when he was yearbook 
editor, he was in that outfit. So the editor of the

03:37.391 --> 03:41.716
yearbook had traditionally come from that 
outfit. But you'd have freshmen who would do most

03:42.978 --> 03:51.428
of the work, indexing, gathering class pictures, 
sorting it all out. So much of the work there was

03:51.448 --> 03:57.156
done by freshmen and the poor. And it was a matter of 
of just assembling that, making sure it was all

03:59.538 --> 04:02.902
submitted properly. And then there were a few 
other pages. We had a man who sold advertising. I

04:09.270 --> 04:10.751
had a couple of assistant editors. One of the guys I 
was smart enough, I think, to pick a guy who did have

04:10.851 --> 04:15.757
some journalistic training. He was a 
photographer. And he did a lot of picture taking

04:17.479 --> 04:21.144
for us. So it mainly was a management exercise. 
What was the process by which you were selected as

04:26.049 --> 04:29.173
the editor? Was there a panel, a committee? There 
were two or three people who applied. And as I think

04:36.059 --> 04:44.627
we probably had to go through, Lane Stevenson 
probably interviewed us. The final arbiter, the

04:44.947 --> 04:51.113
final person that had to approve your selection 
was Earl Rudder. And so I got the speech that Earl

04:52.234 --> 04:56.578
gave just about everyone in those days. It had only 
been about three years before that he'd had to fire

04:56.879 --> 05:02.070
an editor of the battalion, Tommy DeFrank.

05:05.197 --> 05:09.927
So I got the talk from President Rutter about how 
When you do something, don't do anything that's

05:10.582 --> 05:19.095
going to embarrass you or the university, which 
was good advice, excellent advice. And that was at

05:19.115 --> 05:25.905
a time when all over the country, all the other 
student newspapers and organizations were

05:19.115 --> 05:25.905
trying to establish their independence. And 
President Rutter was wise enough to see that this

05:26.426 --> 05:34.778
is something that you probably might be 
embarrassed about later on if you do something

05:26.426 --> 05:34.778
stupid. But he had to be the final person to approve 
it. And Lane Stevenson was your day-to-day? He was

05:42.075 --> 05:44.359
the person that I more or less reported to. Where 
were the offices from? Senior, when I was a

05:47.945 --> 05:59.924
freshman, maybe

05:47.945 --> 05:59.924
through my junior year, they were just down in the 
basement of the YMCA. Of the Y. But then, certainly

06:01.086 --> 06:03.690
the senior year, And perhaps even the junior year, 
I don't remember for sure, we had offices in what's

06:04.261 --> 06:14.852
now the Reed McDonald building, where the 
journalism department is. In fact, the editor of

06:14.872 --> 06:20.838
the yearbook had an office over there. And it was an 
excellent place sometimes to get out of the dorm

06:21.458 --> 06:27.905
and just go over and study or go over and do what you 
wanted to. Let's digress on Mr. Rutter. Go ahead.

06:33.353 --> 06:37.702
describe physically, emotionally, describe 
him? You know, I think the

06:39.325 --> 06:47.262
students at A&M at that time probably well i'm sure 
we didn't have any real appreciation for what type

06:48.743 --> 07:17.637
of man he was he would about the only opportunity 
most students had to be around him was we'd hear him

06:48.743 --> 07:17.637
speak at various official functions and he 
usually was kind of a dull speaker he'd go on and on

06:48.743 --> 07:17.637
and as a result most of us just kind of tuned him out 
and we didn't we didn't really have much

06:48.743 --> 07:17.637
appreciation for him and probably the The closest 
exposure most of us had was his dog that would run

07:18.511 --> 07:36.817
around campus, Earl, and sort of a counterpart to 
Reveille, because as beautiful a dog as Reveille

07:18.511 --> 07:36.817
was, here was Earl, the ugliest bulldog that ever 
lived. But I, in retrospect, I think we were all

07:38.099 --> 07:48.433
dumb not to see what a remarkable man Earl Rucker 
was. And if there is any one person that I think has

07:49.105 --> 07:59.976
probably

07:49.105 --> 07:59.976
catapulted A&M, jump-started us to where we are 
now, it's Earl Rudd. And I think it's fitting that

07:59.996 --> 08:06.322
on campus, there's a statue of him. Because if 
there's two people, he and Sol Ross, probably are

08:06.342 --> 08:14.030
the two people most prominent in developing A&M 
from the start. Describe him physically in

08:14.050 --> 08:19.095
reality, and then what he seemed like.

08:25.775 --> 08:29.101
Well, I'm not sure I can really answer that very 
well. Did he seem big or small? No, he seemed big to

08:31.586 --> 08:35.574
me. And

08:36.215 --> 08:45.673
that's because when I was in his later years, he put 
on quite a bit of weight, I thought. And I don't

08:45.907 --> 08:49.232
think he was, he was not a large man. But he seemed 
heavy, he was heavy set. But he wasn't big. But yet

08:54.441 --> 08:57.065
he had a very commanding presence. A very 
commanding presence. I was telling some friends

09:00.911 --> 09:03.595
of mine recently that I had an experience that was 
one of those things that I just, even then, I

09:03.575 --> 09:13.309
thought, well, this is pretty special, but I 
didn't realize how special it was. I was in his

09:13.329 --> 09:22.542
office one time, and it may have been on this 
occasion when he was interviewing me, and he took a

09:13.329 --> 09:22.542
phone call. He said, he apologized, had to take a 
phone call. He came back, and he said that was CBS,

09:25.225 --> 09:32.215
and he said, they're flying me to Normandy. to 
recreate the 25th anniversary of D-Day. And he

09:39.313 --> 09:45.819
said, I was just trying to make some arrangements 
with them. And me, being at that time an Aggie

09:45.839 --> 09:59.830
junior, this would have been the spring of 68, when 
this happened, probably about the spring of 68.

10:00.831 --> 10:02.893
And I said, you know, I've heard, that you did some 
things in the war with these, but I don't really

10:03.380 --> 10:10.208
have an idea about that. And he proceeded to spend 
about 20 minutes. I was sitting in his office, and I

10:14.193 --> 10:22.984
can still picture him getting up and going over and 
getting some books out in his old white bookcase

10:14.193 --> 10:22.984
along one side of the road, out by his desk. And I see 
him pulling books out, and he come back and showed

10:23.765 --> 10:29.252
me things that he did. And after that was through, I 
had this, I walked back to the dorm and I had this

10:29.688 --> 10:38.021
sense, you know, that was a remarkable 
experience. And as time has gone on, I thought,

10:38.782 --> 10:44.350
that was a remarkable experience. Did he describe 
this with any emotion?

10:53.414 --> 11:01.137
Yeah, he didn't become emotional, but it was 
obvious that he was sort of enjoying it. And my

11:01.318 --> 11:03.745
recollection of what he told me was more personal. 
His account was more personal. It wasn't that,

11:08.454 --> 11:10.578
well, I had two armies here. It was more a matter of, 
well, now, here's something that I did at this

11:10.598 --> 11:16.026
point. And it was a first person account of it. And I 
thought later, that is amazing. This man took the

11:26.163 --> 11:31.251
time to explain something like that to me. And over 
the years, I've gotten to know, become acquainted

11:32.193 --> 11:36.840
with Mrs. Rutter. And she's a remarkable, 
gracious lady. But I've always thought about the

11:40.486 --> 11:44.853
memory of that. And I just had a tremendous respect 
for Mrs. Rutter. Did you students have any

11:49.901 --> 11:54.648
nicknames for him privately? Oh, gosh. Yeah. I'm 
not sure I can remember what, I know there was, I

11:58.552 --> 12:07.864
suspect there were probably about any nicknames. 
I can't remember specific ones. Like I'll bet he

12:09.206 --> 12:10.548
was called Earl. Oh yeah, everybody referred to 
him as Earl. Now he referred to himself sometimes

12:12.871 --> 12:22.643
as Prexy because that's what the president had 
been called when he was an undergraduate. I never

12:22.663 --> 12:25.607
heard students use that for him though. No, I don't 
think so. light bulb up on top of the academic

12:27.408 --> 12:32.633
building was, in his day, called Prexy's Moon. And 
in his undergraduate days, each freshman was

12:33.553 --> 12:41.620
supposed to try to shoot out Prexy's Moon at least 
once. And he mentioned Prexy's Moon once to me. I

12:45.264 --> 12:49.187
didn't know what he was talking about. No, I didn't 
know about that. All right, other characters.

12:51.829 --> 12:55.913
What about in the Corps?

12:56.129 --> 13:05.138
the commandant or any, were there, who was 
commandant in those days? Well, I think it was, I

13:08.448 --> 13:09.851
had to just go back and look. I was not, I was focused 
on the core at that point. What about Dean of

13:13.699 --> 13:15.363
Students? Dean Hannigan was Dean of Students. Did 
you have any interaction? Never had any, never had

13:17.989 --> 13:21.156
any interaction with him. All right. Malan 
Sutherland was, who's now the Dean of Students.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.828
What was his nickname?

13:28.529 --> 13:30.411
Maybe it was fish drill team advisor. Slink. 
Slink, okay, I don't think I heard. Wedge, do you

13:34.377 --> 13:36.099
remember him? Simplest tool known to man, that was 
another one. Where I'm headed is, do you remember

13:40.024 --> 13:44.530
any faculty nicknames that you can share? Oh dear. 
Square root Jackson, cube root Kent. You'd never

13:52.440 --> 13:53.221
know them. Blue book Benton. Blue book Benton, 
yeah, yeah. What

13:58.432 --> 14:04.281
was it, the guy in the business school? Gosh,

14:04.581 --> 14:14.015
what was his name? Oh dear. What was his name, 
Screamin' Al? Screamin' Al Nelson? Yeah. Jock

14:19.627 --> 14:27.559
Woods in Government, Notes Nance, Ivy Lee Taylor.

14:31.144 --> 14:38.955
Now, were those nicknames terms of derision, or in 
fact terms of kind of pleasant recognition? I

14:39.556 --> 14:44.043
think it was pleasant recognition.

14:44.463 --> 14:46.466
OK, so he's a character, but that's all right. 
Yeah. I think that's one. In business, when you

14:49.192 --> 14:56.762
were a business major, who was the key leader of the 
business program overall? Who was the dean? Dean

14:58.364 --> 14:58.965
Pearson. Did you ever have any interaction with 
him? I don't remember. I may have met him once, but

15:02.029 --> 15:08.778
there wasn't all that much. Let's go into the 
classroom. How did students behave in the

15:11.301 --> 15:14.946
classroom? They slept. Did you all go to class 
regularly?

15:23.583 --> 15:25.846
Some did, some didn't.

15:28.429 --> 15:33.715
I think there was probably a greater premium on 
class attendance then than perhaps there is now.

15:33.735 --> 15:34.035
By far. And part of it, I think, is that in the core, 
you had to get up. So if you were up, you might as well

15:41.023 --> 15:42.705
go to class. If I were in a class where I wasn't doing 
well, I darn sure would go. But no, I think there was

15:52.608 --> 15:56.676
a greater emphasis on class attendance. And how 
did students dress? Well, if you were in a corps,

15:59.762 --> 16:02.067
you wore your uniform. What about the civilian 
students? How did they dress?

16:07.407 --> 16:09.910
Well, my recollection is they dressed fairly 
decently. My daughter goes in t-shirts and jeans

16:11.131 --> 16:14.435
now, and I don't think you saw that. I think the 
female students, there would be one female

16:14.495 --> 16:21.424
student sometimes in a class, and she was usually 
dressed fairly nicely. And most of the civilian

16:21.444 --> 16:28.332
students were dressed in slacks or jeans 
sometimes, a nice sport shirt. I think there was a,

16:28.412 --> 16:32.757
I wouldn't say more professional, Maybe some of 
that was contributed to by the Corps. Those guys

16:37.021 --> 16:42.630
were always in uniforms, and so they were always, 
you know, shine shoes and that sort of thing. So

16:42.650 --> 16:45.054
that may have raised the level. All right. Now, the 
first coeds, were there coeds already there your

16:45.294 --> 16:50.883
freshman year? I don't...

16:52.766 --> 16:57.293
What was your freshman year? I was there in the fall 
of 65. I don't remember any classes. I might have

17:03.302 --> 17:21.030
had a class my freshman year with one girl, I don't 
remember, but then certainly by the time

17:03.302 --> 17:21.030
I was a junior, senior, particularly in business, 
in liberal arts classes, you'd frequently have

17:03.302 --> 17:21.030
one, two, three. Some of them were wives of 
students, some of them were just girls from around

17:25.927 --> 17:28.171
the area. But yeah, it wasn't as unusual. How did 
you young men treat those females? You know, I

17:36.809 --> 17:43.622
think for the most part, my sense is that most of the 
time they just ignore them. But were they rude to

17:43.642 --> 17:44.624
them? I think some probably were, but I'm sure that 
if you talked to the girls, they would tell you how

17:48.472 --> 17:59.870
all the comments, they were probably sensitive to 
the comments, but I think for the most part, guys

17:48.472 --> 17:59.870
just ignored them because they didn't really know 
what to say. I don't remember too many situations

18:01.993 --> 18:08.743
where there was an open abuse or, you know, get out 
of here or anything like that. I'm sure that

18:08.763 --> 18:13.230
happened to them and they tell you that, but I 
didn't witness anything like that. One I tell on

18:13.514 --> 18:14.756
myself. I had a class, a 1 o'clock class, on the 
second floor of Nagel. And the history department

18:20.683 --> 18:23.286
office was on the west end of that hallway. And for a 
few months, there was an extremely shapely

18:23.807 --> 18:31.076
part-time secretary in the history department. 
And she would come after. She had a late lunch. And

18:34.840 --> 18:38.044
at about 1.15 to 1.20, you'd hear these high heels. 
And every guy in the room. would start staring. And

18:43.063 --> 18:47.529
so one day, just as they were all, I went over and 
closed the door. And I heard an epithet from the

18:48.530 --> 18:55.019
back of the room aimed at me. Do you recall about 
what it cost when you were a student? What did a

19:01.548 --> 19:08.597
semester or a year cost?

19:10.973 --> 19:18.922
I'm going to say a semester was somewhere under 
$500 or so for everything. I can still remember

19:18.942 --> 19:29.695
that, I can't remember exactly, tuition was $50, 
you know, and I'm thinking that the room and board

19:18.942 --> 19:29.695
was like $300 or something. I may be totally off, 
but I can still remember that talking with my

19:29.715 --> 19:36.643
father at one time and realizing that it was 
cheaper for me to go to the school at A&M and live

19:37.315 --> 19:46.366
down there than it would have been for me to live at 
home and go to TCU. And did you earn any or all of that

19:47.547 --> 19:52.313
money yourself?

19:55.557 --> 20:03.947
When I became a junior and went on contract, Army 
contract, I got a little pay for that. When I was a

20:04.653 --> 20:12.225
senior, the

20:04.653 --> 20:12.225
job as editor of the yearbook was a paying 
position. I got some money. It was about $50, $75 a

20:13.226 --> 20:15.430
month for that. But then what I'd do in the summers 
is I'd work like everybody else. I went to summer

20:18.895 --> 20:22.060
school some at UTA. Took two or three history 
classes out there. Took history of England out

20:23.883 --> 20:26.026
there. That was recommended if you thought about 
law school when I was thinking about it. And so I'd

20:29.071 --> 20:39.126
work, I'd go to school and then I'd work some more, 
but I tried to do that so I'd have some spending

20:29.071 --> 20:39.126
money. You didn't have a job, a full-time job? No, 
no, not while I was in school. See, once I talked to

20:44.474 --> 20:55.450
these people in the 30s and 40s, having a job, 
particularly in the dining hall, was the end of the

20:44.474 --> 20:55.450
rainbow to help Let's see, do you remember any 
famous visitors to the campus? Politicians,

21:02.499 --> 21:06.744
speakers, performers?

21:10.989 --> 21:17.337
Oh yeah, I know we had them and I'm trying to think 
of...

21:23.392 --> 21:30.660
They'd have some performers come, you know, and 
appear at G. Raleigh White.

21:31.561 --> 21:44.275
Seems like that was about the time that they 
started the Skona series, and I remember they'd

21:31.561 --> 21:44.275
have some people come in for that, and I used to 
enjoy coming over to some of those and listen.

21:44.295 --> 21:51.002
Probably most of my friends thought that was very 
stupid of me to do that, showing any interest at all

21:44.295 --> 21:51.002
in anything. I don't think we had, we certainly 
didn't have anywhere near the level of outside

21:51.995 --> 22:00.129
speakers that they have now. Let's see, then 
various organizations. What happened in or

22:03.875 --> 22:06.659
around the YMCA? What was the why? What function 
did it serve? You know, I think that was more, my

22:10.285 --> 22:17.918
sense is that was more the sort of the focal point of 
activity. Many of the student organizations had

22:18.269 --> 22:22.213
offices there. Student housing was in there, as I 
recall. And they had a lot of different student

22:25.958 --> 22:38.932
organizations that would meet there, all the way 
from religious organizations to hometown clubs

22:25.958 --> 22:38.932
and all kinds of things like that. As I mentioned, 
some of the student publications had their

22:38.952 --> 22:44.038
offices in there early on. MSC. What role did the 
MSC? The MSC was, I think they used to say it was the

22:50.505 --> 22:55.810
living room of the campus, and I think that was 
exactly right. You know, my goodness, when you got

22:56.250 --> 23:16.288
to be a freshman year, you'd go over there to try to 
avoid upperclassmen some, and when you got to be a

22:56.250 --> 23:16.288
junior and senior, you'd go over there between 
classes and sit with your buddies and drink

22:56.250 --> 23:16.288
coffee, and I can still remember that Of course, 
now they've got that big dining room area in the

23:16.555 --> 23:20.901
MSC. But back in those days, they used to have about 
two or three different type of coffee shops in

23:21.743 --> 23:27.010
there. And, boy, you could just go in there and sit 
for an hour. People would just come and sit down.

23:31.997 --> 23:33.700
And then somebody would get up and leave and go to 
class. Somebody else would come and sit down. You

23:35.062 --> 23:38.507
could spend the whole morning over there if you 
wanted to, visiting with friends. The barber shop

23:39.228 --> 23:43.474
was over there where you could get your hair cut. 
Those guys weren't the most skilled barbers. I'm

23:46.402 --> 23:49.407
sure about all they knew was shaving heads. And 
then there were all the activities that the MSC

23:49.527 --> 23:53.334
sponsored. Alright, Guy and Hall. What role did it 
play? Guy and Hall was used, in my recollection,

23:57.902 --> 24:05.836
mainly when they wanted to have large meetings, 
like class. I think we had class meetings over

24:05.856 --> 24:08.280
there. I don't remember, it was not used as much 
because when they wanted to, it was mainly a

24:08.733 --> 24:18.000
theater. They had plays in there and things of that 
nature. They weren't showing movies anymore,

24:20.709 --> 24:22.891
were they? I don't believe they were. I don't 
remember. I don't believe they were. Any large

24:26.374 --> 24:30.497
shows that came would play in G. Robbie White. They 
still had the theaters north of campus and campus

24:30.517 --> 24:34.121
theater. But Guyon Hall was just sort of falling 
into disuse as much as anything, as I remember.

24:41.707 --> 24:47.312
Campus, either on campus or off campus religious 
activities, did those affect you at all? Sure. I

24:48.473 --> 24:55.741
come from a Baptist church here. My first year down 
there, I went to church frequently. And the First

25:01.147 --> 25:05.091
Baptist Church was right across the street from 
the campus. And it's moved, but most of the other

25:05.812 --> 25:11.798
churches are still there in the same location. And 
I think as much as anything, those for students

25:11.778 --> 25:21.049
were refuges from core things, if that's what they 
were looking for. But I was not involved in many of

25:21.149 --> 25:30.060
the, like a lot of the kids now are involved in 
different student ministry activities. I wasn't

25:30.080 --> 25:32.223
involved in that. Let's see. Help. me understand 
the student body in general when you were there.

25:39.180 --> 25:43.728
Basically, these students came geographically 
from where? Cities, country, everywhere?

25:52.295 --> 25:54.440
I've never thought about that specifically. I do 
think that there were probably more students then

25:54.881 --> 25:59.854
from small towns than there are now. But I think 
it's also true that the largest number of students

26:01.438 --> 26:06.791
came from the largest towns. It seemed like there 
were more from Houston, San Antonio, I was always

26:10.435 --> 26:15.581
amazed at A&M how many students there were from San 
Antonio. It seemed like there were a huge number

26:15.601 --> 26:18.665
from San Antonio. There weren't as many from Fort 
Worth in those days. There seemed like a lot more

26:21.889 --> 26:23.691
from Dallas. But then every time you meet someone, 
there are so many from small towns in East Texas and

26:24.452 --> 26:33.523
Central Texas.

26:34.499 --> 26:37.262
And you find more from out of state, I think, too. 
For some reason, I had the sense that there were

26:37.702 --> 26:43.528
more out of state students then than perhaps there 
are now. But that's just anecdotal. I don't know if

26:45.711 --> 26:46.491
that's true. All right. If liberal is someone 
receptive to change, conservative is someone

26:47.593 --> 26:57.783
hesitant to change, attitudinally, what was the 
student body like? As conservative as you could

26:58.204 --> 27:01.587
get. in terms of religious affiliation? Were they 
diverse or basically Protestant?

27:12.162 --> 27:20.098
My sense is that it was more diversity than you 
might think. Probably more Protestant. I can

27:21.981 --> 27:26.788
still remember some Jewish people who were in 
school when I was. Several Catholics. I think it

27:29.632 --> 27:31.676
was a pretty good event. Do you remember any events 
which indicated anything other than respect for

27:31.696 --> 27:38.065
someone's religious... Oh, no. No, I don't.

27:42.012 --> 27:47.520
I think that what I do remember is a lot of people who 
were For the most part, when you took males who were

27:49.272 --> 28:01.508
19 to 21 years old, there wasn't the strongest 
religious devotion in any group like that. But I

28:01.608 --> 28:04.952
never sensed any religious intolerance. Do you 
remember any international students? Yes. There

28:10.332 --> 28:17.404
were a lot of graduate students, of course, with 
typical Aggie sensitivity. Most of them lived in a

28:18.465 --> 28:24.335
dorm that was called the Black Hole of Calcutta.

28:24.475 --> 28:34.652
But I remember

28:24.475 --> 28:34.652
there was at least a couple of Korean students in an 
accounting class I had. There were a smattering of

28:35.206 --> 28:40.354
them, but I think they were mainly in graduate 
school. Were there any black students? Sure. Oh,

28:42.717 --> 28:43.138
yeah. Well, I say sure. There were at least two that 
were in the Corps when I was. One of them was a very

28:48.947 --> 28:50.749
good friend of mine. Another one, I didn't know him 
well. He lives in Fort Worth now. I don't really, I

28:55.917 --> 28:57.720
still don't really know him. This one you said was a 
good friend of yours, isn't it? Bill Mayholmes.

29:01.987 --> 29:03.068
Spell it. M-A-H-O-M-E-S. Bill was... Because, 
see, those are... I want to... If I can, I want to try

29:09.374 --> 29:15.860
to sell the idea that I should go interview some of 
the first women and some of the first black

29:09.374 --> 29:15.860
students. Because I have the impression that 
there were no problems with the first black

29:15.880 --> 29:21.445
students. I don't think there were any incidents. 
There weren't any demonstrations. No

29:26.270 --> 29:27.631
demonstrations. I think... I think Bill... Bill 
would tell you that it was not easy. He and I had all

29:36.223 --> 29:38.925
of our classes together our freshman year. We were 
both in engineering. Both of us changed from that.

29:43.290 --> 29:44.951
In fact, Bill was a good friend of mine. We went to 
law school together. He went on to law school with

29:46.273 --> 29:48.475
me. And he's done very well. But to compound his 
situation, he stuttered, which I admire him for.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.224
for staying with somebody. I wouldn't have been 
tough enough to make it. But no, it had to have been

30:07.753 --> 30:18.602
very difficult because

30:07.753 --> 30:18.602
there was not the restriction Well, 
upperclassmen in those days, you know, a freshman

30:19.443 --> 30:24.308
is just a piece of property. And so there was 
probably no limit on what freshmen, they would

30:24.548 --> 30:29.533
feel no constraints. Upperclassmen would feel no 
constraints on what they said to a freshman. Now,

30:31.996 --> 30:33.898
was he a freshman the same way you were? So he's 
among the first. I think he probably was the first

30:36.280 --> 30:40.885
guy to ever go through four years. See, this is 
another part of A&M's history that Mr. Rudder

30:44.649 --> 30:45.570
handled well. He called the Pentagon, without any 
of us knowing him, wearing those two stars as Major

30:49.362 --> 30:55.429
General in the Reserve, and said, okay, we are 
going to integrate. The board has backed me. That

30:57.912 --> 31:00.315
hasn't publicly been announced. When you send 
some of the active duty enlisted personnel, as you

31:00.395 --> 31:16.855
normally do with the Army paying the bill, this 
summer when you send some that are black, no

31:00.395 --> 31:16.855
problem cases, nobody's got a conduct problem or a 
grade problem, And Mr. Heaton then called every

31:17.375 --> 31:24.415
faculty member and said, don't worry, when you 
meet class tomorrow, they have been admitted.
