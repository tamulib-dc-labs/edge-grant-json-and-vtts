WEBVTT

00:04.334 --> 00:13.549
We left off with you seeing it on how you felt about 
Vietnam or what you knew about Vietnam before I

00:04.334 --> 00:13.549
turned the tape over. And I just asked you what you 
knew about Vietnam before you went to Vietnam. And

00:18.297 --> 00:21.202
you were telling me that you had seen something on 
TV. Not really. I didn't really know that much when

00:23.245 --> 00:26.771
I was in high school. So I went into the service when 
I was 20. And but in high school we all knew we were

00:31.722 --> 00:39.152
aware of Vietnam, which I graduated my school in 
63. And so not, you know, not a whole lot, but we knew

00:40.695 --> 00:47.324
that what was happening so. Didn't affect us a 
whole lot, but. I was in college. And because of

00:54.133 --> 00:57.358
the.

00:58.148 --> 01:03.518
Because I was too busy doing things I shouldn't 
have been doing, like partying and not studying.

01:04.358 --> 01:07.402
Got put on scholastic probation. So you lost your 
S2A? Yeah, 2S. Went from 2S to 1A like overnight.

01:14.993 --> 01:17.616
And then if you were 1A, you were gone. Were you 
married then? No. So you didn't even have that, you

01:20.621 --> 01:24.166
couldn't even get out of the way because of being 
married? You weren't engaged? And you could get

01:25.187 --> 01:26.729
out that way. I know, at that time, for a while you 
could. Up through, well, Kennedy let you stay out

01:30.494 --> 01:33.859
without... He had one child for a year. They had 
more marriages, did you know? More marriages in

01:38.652 --> 01:46.402
that period than they had in 1946 after the war 
ended, just to keep out of the war. I had a lot of

01:47.163 --> 01:50.366
friends of mine that got married to stay out. But 
you didn't. Did you object to being sent to

01:51.728 --> 01:56.434
Vietnam? No, I volunteered to go to Vietnam. What 
had happened is... We were at a base, at a strategic

02:02.324 --> 02:10.396
air command base, and they were taking everybody. 
They had even taken all our M16s. They had left us

02:12.339 --> 02:14.482
with carbines. We were armed with carbines, which 
is a good weapon, but we weren't. It was a World War

02:19.049 --> 02:21.092
II weapon. And the M16s were all being sent to 
Vietnam. At that time, the Air Force was the only

02:23.555 --> 02:29.985
one that had the M16 because it was an M16-issue 
weapon. They had to go away with the M1? No, yeah.

02:34.272 --> 02:35.713
The Army had the M14. What had happened to the M1? 
Well, the M1 was obsolete. It wasn't a repeating

02:40.077 --> 02:42.079
rocket, right? Yeah, it was. It wasn't 
semi-repeating, but not like the M16, was it?

02:45.842 --> 02:54.771
Yeah, you could keep firing with an M1, but still it 
was real heavy, and it just wasn't effective as

02:45.842 --> 02:54.771
supposedly as the M14. The Army adopted the M14 to 
replace the M1. The Air Force, Colt, offered the

03:00.104 --> 03:03.668
M-16 to the Army that turned it down because of the 
M-14. They'd already taken it. So the Air Force

03:07.151 --> 03:09.234
took the M-16. When I got to Vietnam, you know, I had 
guys trade me M-14s for my rifle. Wasn't the M-16

03:15.800 --> 03:19.604
lighter weight than the M-14? Yeah, a lot lighter. 
So, but anyway, what had happened... They were

03:27.307 --> 03:32.211
sending everybody to Vietnam when everybody knew 
that sooner or later you were going to go. And we

03:33.352 --> 03:37.076
weren't real happy with who we was at anyway, so a 
bunch of us. At that time, I was married. And when I

03:39.178 --> 03:45.303
went to Vietnam, I'd been married seven months. So 
you could have gotten out and gone to Vietnam

03:45.864 --> 03:48.286
anyway. No. No, you were married. You got married 
after you went into service. And took a girl from my

03:53.811 --> 03:56.453
hometown and But anyway, we had been married that 
seven months. Well, we got married May the 1st, and

04:00.310 --> 04:03.175
I got my orders in August. And then I left like 
December the 22nd or 23rd. Good timing thing,

04:09.284 --> 04:11.047
right before Christmas. Right before Christmas. 
Good timing. Well, that's the Air Force for you.

04:14.413 --> 04:16.015
The Air Force has timing like that. So I spent 
Christmas guarding the perimeter around Bob

04:16.075 --> 04:21.804
Hope. I didn't ever see him. He really did come 
there? Yeah, he was there, but we were securing the

04:25.576 --> 04:28.520
perimeter. To make sure that he didn't get killed. 
Or anybody else that was watching. So we couldn't

04:32.405 --> 04:35.229
see him, but we... Anyway, that was Christmas. But 
yeah, we volunteered to go. And we could go either

04:40.115 --> 04:41.958
two ways. We could go just ourselves, or we could go 
to dog school and take a dog. Either way. So that...

04:49.707 --> 04:53.191
You have been to air ground defense down at San 
Antonio. Yeah. I believe it's air base ground

04:54.613 --> 04:56.275
defense. Yeah. And that's on the LBJ Ranch. Are you 
aware of that? Part of the southern part of Israel?

05:04.165 --> 05:07.489
I don't know that. Yes. You know, the first day. He 
rented the property, I believe, to the Air Force.

05:13.376 --> 05:19.123
The first day we were there, we walked in and they 
announced. They said, how many of you are going to

05:19.593 --> 05:22.637
Tonsenute? And there was several raised their 
hands. And they said, as of this moment, Tonsenute

05:24.399 --> 05:32.668
Air Force Base is under ground attack.

05:32.688 --> 05:38.816
And that was kind of shocking when you were not ever 
involved in anything like that. You knew the

05:38.836 --> 05:44.883
possibility was there, but when you realized all 
of a sudden that it was reality. Where were you when

05:44.943 --> 05:46.424
you found out about this? We were at the combat 
school. In San Antonio. That made you really feel

05:51.247 --> 05:52.550
secure. Made us really feel good. They were, like I 
said, under attack at that time. Then we went home

06:01.366 --> 06:09.360
from there and had, I don't know how many days 
before we left to go overseas. But we weren't, I

06:09.779 --> 06:12.282
wasn't afraid, you know. Well, did you, do you 
think that the, that school that you went to down in

06:12.302 --> 06:22.053
San Antonio, out of Lackland, it helped you in any, 
in the type of warfare? Because I, from what I

06:22.173 --> 06:31.223
understand, I don't know whether it was in 66, but 
more recently they teach guerrilla warfare down

06:22.173 --> 06:31.223
there. Yeah. Did they teach any of it then? No, not 
really. Most everything we learned was, uh,

06:37.150 --> 06:43.256
unarmed

06:37.150 --> 06:43.256
defense. Yeah, some of the dealing with North 
Vietnamese customs like booby traps and

06:43.877 --> 06:54.828
different kinds of stuff like that, but it wasn't 
real thorough. It was a new thing. I remember our

06:58.391 --> 07:04.698
instructor in unarmed defense, he was crazy. And 
Everything was killed. Everything he did had

07:07.551 --> 07:09.994
something to do with killing. Nothing was bend 
somebody's arm and take them. It was to kill them.

07:16.722 --> 07:29.837
And I remember him telling us, and he really was 
crazy and everything, but I remember him telling

07:16.722 --> 07:29.837
us, he said, you'll know when you pass my test, when 
you step your foot back on the United States soil.

07:31.876 --> 07:36.184
He said, until then, you won't know if you passed or 
not. Obviously, you passed the test. Well, so,

07:37.666 --> 07:40.592
some of us passed the test. Well, there's some good 
logic to that. Well, there is. It kind of makes you,

07:43.757 --> 07:53.395
you know, I don't know, kind of gives you a funny 
feeling that, well, I've got to wait a year to see if

07:43.757 --> 07:53.395
I passed the test. Kind of does. But I never forgot 
that. Well, obviously you didn't because you came

07:58.456 --> 08:00.819
back. Yeah, right. And there were many, many that 
did not come back. Right. Was Jane, Jane Fonda came

08:09.569 --> 08:14.475
over there at the time while you were there? While I 
was there, she came, made her trip. Would you like

08:17.058 --> 08:18.420
to tell me a little bit about that? Well,

08:18.900 --> 08:24.647
morale wasn't really good. Anyway, and because of 
the fact. That we didn't have. We didn't hear or

08:31.563 --> 08:34.267
feel the support. From our own people, you know the 
Americans are at home. We also were feeling that

08:40.895 --> 08:44.019
same. You know that same kind of let down. Of course 
you had it from from the enemy anyway. But then

08:49.927 --> 08:53.892
again, all we heard was bad things. from our own 
people. And then Jane Fonda makes a trip to the

08:56.457 --> 09:15.136
North and starts feeling sorry and telling all 
those people over there, including the combat

08:56.457 --> 09:15.136
troops, how we are bloodthirsty and killing 
people when we shouldn't be, doing all the things

08:56.457 --> 09:15.136
that we shouldn't be doing. And I don't know how 
many American GIs lost their lives because of her

09:17.598 --> 09:22.123
trip. But I know a lot of them did because she fed all 
of the NARC energy to be able to fight that much

09:22.762 --> 09:36.959
harder because of the things she told them, 
because of the trips she made. I mean, they like

09:38.741 --> 09:40.563
hearing that. That's good stuff, good 
propaganda. And it made them just fight that much

09:43.747 --> 09:45.569
harder. And I think I blame our for allowing her to 
make that trip.

09:56.334 --> 10:03.803
To begin with, I felt like they should have shot her 
when she came back as a traitor. I think she was as

10:03.823 --> 10:09.930
much a traitor as any traitor in the history of our 
country. And I don't think she either should not

10:09.950 --> 10:17.659
have been allowed to come back or she should have 
been dealt with when she came back as a traitor. But

10:19.293 --> 10:24.761
now I feel like that she shouldn't have ever been 
allowed to make the trip to begin with. There are a

10:24.781 --> 10:27.104
lot of people that share your feelings against 
her. There's a lot of people that don't have any.

10:28.225 --> 10:29.667
She has an exercise deal. And a lot of people that 
I've heard just in passing say, I won't touch it.

10:33.112 --> 10:33.412
Yeah. Because of what she did to our guys in 
Vietnam. I don't know how the lady sleeps. I really

10:39.000 --> 10:40.222
don't. Because I know a lot of people lost their 
lives because of her. So... Well, you said that

10:49.769 --> 11:00.719
you felt that the war could have been won. Do you 
think if Barry Goldwater had been elected

11:00.779 --> 11:14.791
president in 1964 instead of LBJ,

11:00.779 --> 11:14.791
because Barry Goldwater, if you recall, was 
called a warmonger, and he didn't know anything

11:00.779 --> 11:14.791
after all. He was a brigadier general in the Air 
Force, but he didn't know anything. Yeah. about

11:19.030 --> 11:22.575
what was going on, and he really did know a lot about 
what was going on. I think Barry Goldwater would

11:23.496 --> 11:28.924
have been a better president for the war than 
Lyndon Johnson. I feel like Dwight Eisenhower

11:28.944 --> 11:37.516
would have been a better president than Lyndon 
Johnson, you know, as far as the war is concerned.

11:37.536 --> 11:40.360
Or General MacArthur, or, you know, a lot of 
people. I don't know if it would have been, I don't

11:41.342 --> 11:45.848
know if he would have been allowed to do he wanted to 
do as a president you know congress would allow him

11:46.452 --> 12:08.308
to do um i don't know it's hard to say lbj and kennedy 
did what they wanted to do yeah they did so you know i

11:46.452 --> 12:08.308
can't see why goldwater right i don't know i you 
know it could have been done so much different you

11:46.452 --> 12:08.308
know that You know, I mean, we've got bombs that'll 
take care of all of the country of Vietnam in one

12:09.537 --> 12:18.790
trip. Well, Dwight Eisenhower threatened them 
when this thing first started. He threatened to

12:23.957 --> 12:28.183
use atomic bombs. Really? And Congress said no. 
Are you aware that this was never a declared war?

12:32.749 --> 12:33.711
Oh, yeah. That it was just the Gulf of Tonkin Accord 
that got them... Bright. Into the war? There

12:40.745 --> 12:52.018
again, if you ask, and I know you understand this as 
well as I do, but if you ask the guys that were there,

12:40.745 --> 12:52.018
it was a war. There's no question about the fact 
that it was a war. But why are you bitter about that?

13:00.367 --> 13:08.856
And they say, and a lot of other people, a lot of 
other Vietnam vets are bitter because some of them

13:00.367 --> 13:08.856
say that they didn't... They weren't fighting for 
anything. Well, I don't know why they say that. I

13:14.506 --> 13:25.518
feel like, to begin with, that when you're born in 
this country, to begin with, that you, as a male,

13:14.506 --> 13:25.518
you're born with an obligation. Not because I'm 
unusually patriotic or anything like that, but I

13:25.538 --> 13:37.510
believe that you're born with an obligation in 
this country to serve, to defend it at any cost. if

13:37.895 --> 13:39.296
you're called to do that. I don't feel like it's up 
to me to decide whether that cause is just or not. I

13:46.264 --> 13:52.390
feel like it's a decision that should be made by the 
people we appoint to do that. And when I went, my

13:53.511 --> 14:06.805
daddy went before me, his father before him, and on 
down the line, our fathers, whether you go or not,

13:53.511 --> 14:06.805
somebody went to do it. And I believe we're 
obligated to do that.

14:13.678 --> 14:20.028
When we went over there, you didn't know how it was 
going to turn out. I mean, you couldn't go over

14:20.609 --> 14:28.422
there in 1962 or 1966 and say, well, we're going to 
leave here and pull out in 1973. Nobody knew that.

14:32.068 --> 14:33.450
So how are you going to predict that? So you've got 
to go over there and fight for a cause. You go over

14:36.827 --> 14:42.015
and fight because you were asked to do that by your 
country. I don't think we need to question the

14:42.256 --> 14:50.409
president or we need to question Congress when 
we're sent to go somewhere to fight. I'm very, very

14:51.791 --> 14:55.797
bitter at the deserters during that time. And I'm 
very, very bitter... and our political process

14:58.726 --> 15:01.310
for pardoning them. I don't think that should have 
been done. I think they should have went to jail. I

15:06.137 --> 15:14.549
think if we ever have another war, they're going to 
do that same thing again because they got away with

15:06.137 --> 15:14.549
it. I just believe that. I believe everybody that 
died in Vietnam died with a... a sense of duty, and I

15:22.756 --> 15:28.844
think they were fighting as hard as they could 
fight when they died. And I think they were doing

15:29.765 --> 15:34.371
it, and I think they had pride in their uniform, and 
I think they had pride in the flag. Were you aware

15:35.232 --> 15:42.621
that college graduates were getting out of the 
service by Using technology and medical lying,

15:44.423 --> 15:50.392
actually lying, to keep from going into service? 
Because their idea was that the people who, the

15:50.893 --> 15:57.624
lower class, uneducated people should go and do 
their dirty work. Sure. That's, you know, I guess

15:58.505 --> 16:02.231
that's a sign of the times, kind of. But, and, you 
know, that's a, they're the ones that's got to live

16:02.492 --> 16:08.140
with it. You know, I don't, I don't, I know people 
that lied about medical things that weren't

16:12.571 --> 16:24.810
college graduates, you know, that were high 
school graduates that lied to get out of being

16:12.571 --> 16:24.810
drafted and get out of going to the service. And I 
personally know people that did that. I think

16:28.636 --> 16:30.478
that's something we can't control. I don't think I 
can control it. I don't think anybody else that's

16:32.301 --> 16:35.406
going to always go on. I think I'm going to have to 
live with it, as you said. Yeah. You said you've

16:39.421 --> 16:43.085
read, you're familiar with Phil Caputo? Yeah. He 
was a college graduate who went into the Marines

16:45.608 --> 16:57.403
after he had, because he really didn't know what he 
was getting into. And when he came back to the

16:57.423 --> 17:00.487
United States, he stayed out. Have you read his 
book? Yeah, I have. Some time ago. before the movie

17:06.149 --> 17:08.793
ever came out. Do you remember enough about the 
book to remember how he... Were the things that he

17:15.622 --> 17:20.309
wrote in there pretty standard for what you were 
aware of in Vietnam? I think so. I think so. I think

17:21.471 --> 17:22.692
it was pretty much... I remember... You know, I was 
captivated by... There's... I can read a book

17:27.119 --> 17:29.041
about Vietnam. I cannot watch a movie about 
Vietnam. And I can enjoy it. I'm... I'm very, very

17:35.326 --> 17:37.869
much against Vietnam movies. Why is that? 
Because, well, I've never seen any of them to begin

17:40.273 --> 17:46.561
with. That was a stupid question, wasn't it? Well, 
no, not really. I have seen, I've

17:50.767 --> 18:00.840
never had a desire to watch them for no particular 
reason. And, you know, the next vet may say, well, I

18:00.860 --> 18:05.046
watch them all, you know, I enjoy watching them 
all. But me personally, I've watched Tour of Duty

18:05.802 --> 18:11.609
from time to time. I think it's not realistic in a 
lot of ways. It's a soap opera, I think. But stuff

18:16.914 --> 18:22.160
like Platoon, stuff like that, I've never seen. 
Good Morning Vietnam. I saw Good Morning Vietnam.

18:25.264 --> 18:26.545
Pretty realistic. I didn't know anything about 
the disc jockeys and that sort of thing. But a lot of

18:31.170 --> 18:33.493
it was pretty realistic. I kind of enjoyed it. But 
it was funny. Probably the lighter side of

18:36.262 --> 18:45.552
Vietnam, but with the undercurrent of the true 
Vietnam still being there. Platoon, those type of

18:45.712 --> 18:51.358
movies, Deer Hunter, I've never seen none of 
those. Here, not very long ago, I bought a movie,

18:53.020 --> 19:03.231
rented a movie, Platoon, and I don't even know why I 
did it. I watched about half of that movie, maybe

19:04.932 --> 19:08.837
not half. And that was more than I wanted to watch. 
And halfway through it, and I was watching it by

19:12.862 --> 19:16.366
myself. I shut it off. I had a real, real bad 
reaction to that movie. And I told my wife, I said,

19:22.754 --> 19:31.004
that right there is the reason that I don't watch 
that garbage. Because it's not anything but

19:31.024 --> 19:33.167
garbage. It wasn't like it? No, it could have been 
in certain situations, but Vietnam movies like

19:35.108 --> 19:51.392
Platoon, which was the best picture, depicts the 
Vietnam veteran as a drug pothead, an acid head.

19:52.115 --> 19:57.206
And full of foul language, you know, just in a 
sadist. And that's not the way every Vietnam

19:57.827 --> 20:01.495
veteran in Vietnam was. And I don't think it's 
fair, and I don't think it's wrong. And it makes me

20:05.082 --> 20:07.788
very, very angry. Super, super angry. And I didn't 
know it until I watched that. But there was a reason

20:12.432 --> 20:15.356
I never had wanted to see them. I guess that's part 
of it. So, what you're saying, this is 1989, and

20:16.278 --> 20:23.348
you're still dealing with some of the feelings 
that you had going back to 1966 and 67. Yeah, yeah. I

20:26.172 --> 20:30.678
reacted really, really, really bad to that movie. 
In fact, I apologized to my wife for the way I

20:31.179 --> 20:38.610
reacted to that movie. I broke down from that 
movie. And really, it really affected

20:43.432 --> 20:49.719
me very, very badly. So, you know, and like I said, 
the next veteran may not even bother. You

20:54.845 --> 21:04.957
mentioned, you brought up the drug situation one, 
and you mentioned that in the platoon they did,

20:54.845 --> 21:04.957
I've seen the movie, and they did, I was not 
impressed with it, I did not like it. Of course, I

21:04.977 --> 21:09.642
had not been through what you've been through, but 
I was totally impressed, especially since I had

21:04.977 --> 21:09.642
it. Well, a lot of people must have liked it to be a 
best picture. Well, probably our teenage

21:13.012 --> 21:19.899
population probably is enough to throw it into the 
bestseller. What was the drug, what did you find

21:19.939 --> 21:23.762
the drug situation at this large base? Saw a lot of 
the drugs, you know. We had customs. Security

21:29.368 --> 21:33.211
police does handle customs in foreign countries. 
But, I mean, it was a joke. We checked like every

21:35.053 --> 21:36.895
fifth guy. The ones of us that pulled that duty. Did 
you have dogs? No, we didn't use dogs and

21:40.501 --> 21:42.103
customers. The only thing we used dogs for was, 
they were all kill dogs. Dogs, I'm sorry? All kill

21:47.671 --> 21:49.093
dogs. Kill? Yeah, that's all we knew how to do. Any 
drug or bomb dogs? We had bomb dogs. We started

21:55.001 --> 22:00.909
using those after we got a few things blown up in our 
gate. So those bomb dogs really did... They did a

22:03.115 --> 22:05.158
good job. And yet you never hear anything, 
nothing's been heard about it in the news media,

22:05.618 --> 22:20.939
nothing's been said about these things that you 
had and the conditions that you lived under,

22:05.618 --> 22:20.939
nothing's been said about it because of the 
politicians. When did you, when you were, well,

22:20.959 --> 22:25.225
you mentioned something about a heroin deal. 
Yeah, the drugs. The drugs we saw, you know, we

22:27.972 --> 22:31.956
checked every fifth guy. We didn't have time to 
mess with all those guys. You'd find all kinds of

22:34.698 --> 22:36.140
things. You'd find guys trying to get out with 
claymore mines, with grenades, with marijuana,

22:36.160 --> 22:45.368
with heroin, with opium. What? Claymores. It's a 
mine that you set that sweeps an area. It's a bomb, a

22:54.037 --> 22:55.278
mine. And they use it? Oh, they try to take them 
home. The drugs? Drugs, bombs, grenades on the

23:00.005 --> 23:03.270
plane. So you had to start searching them on the 
plane? No, we searched them before they got on.

23:07.316 --> 23:09.339
Every fifth guy. So four in there got by with no 
telling what they had. But anyway. Did they know

23:14.767 --> 23:18.672
that it was every fifth guy you checked? Or did they 
ever rotate numbers? No, they didn't know. Nobody

23:21.677 --> 23:22.498
cared. And the guys didn't care. They were going 
home. So did it upset, did this movie, that platoon

23:26.417 --> 23:36.307
about showing the drug problem, did it upset you 
because of the, did it depict the drug problems you

23:26.417 --> 23:36.307
were aware of? No. The thing that bothers me about 
it, it depicts a Vietnam veteran as a nasty hit. I

23:43.815 --> 23:48.300
mean, as a, you know, there was lots of drug 
problems in Vietnam. You were upset about the

23:48.420 --> 23:51.523
generalization saying that everybody was. Well, 
and that everybody was uncontrollably on drugs.

23:55.868 --> 23:58.331
That's what I'm saying, everybody, that's a 
generalization. That's not true, yeah. There was

23:59.833 --> 24:19.097
guys, there was guys that used drugs that if

23:59.833 --> 24:19.097
you can put yourself in a situation where you're in 
a combat situation, you're sitting out in a muddy

23:59.833 --> 24:19.097
hole and it's raining so hard that you can't see, 
you've got someone out there that wants to kill

24:20.090 --> 24:23.894
you. And at the same time, they're telling you at 
home that you're a baby killer and that you're a

24:23.914 --> 24:35.445
sadist and that you're a slob for being there and 
that you shouldn't have ever been born and all this

24:23.914 --> 24:35.445
kind of stuff. And then you're sitting there and 
your morale is below ground level. And you know

24:42.933 --> 24:49.219
you've got drugs, you've got marijuana right 
there in your hand, and you know all you've got to do

24:42.933 --> 24:49.219
is smoke that. or take it, or smoke some opium, and 
you're going to feel really good for a little

24:49.638 --> 24:56.408
while. That's what most people are going to do. 
They're going to take the opium right now. You

25:01.896 --> 25:03.058
can't really blame them for it. There's a lot of 
instances guys use drugs that I can condone.

25:10.529 --> 25:12.652
Just to feel good just for a little while. When you 
feel so bad and so let down from everything, from

25:19.456 --> 25:31.432
everything around you, then that high for a little 
while has worked quite a bit. We had the opium

25:31.452 --> 25:33.575
problem. We found a civilian one night that had an 
estimated $3 million worth of opium. We weren't

25:40.143 --> 25:41.285
allowed to keep it. We wasn't allowed to follow it 
up. We thought it was fixing to be loaded on a

25:43.888 --> 25:47.573
civilian aircraft. We weren't allowed to follow 
it up for, I don't know why, but we wanted to find out

25:48.211 --> 25:54.037
where it was going. And then we took it back to 
headquarters and the Vietnamese QC, Quang Cong,

25:55.098 --> 26:00.524
took it away from us. And they allowed them to take 
it from us. They wouldn't have taken it from us if we

26:03.827 --> 26:09.173
hadn't have just given it to them. But we weren't 
going to. And it was almost fixing to cause a a war

26:14.097 --> 26:16.460
right there. Right. But we were ordered to give the 
opium to them. And I'm sure they either sold it or

26:22.847 --> 26:27.091
used it. You mentioned a while back about the 
Purple Heart. This guy got the Purple Heart one

26:31.916 --> 26:34.079
actually. He should have received medals for... 
He should have received the ones the major got.

26:41.307 --> 26:42.568
Well, there was a high... There's

26:42.987 --> 27:00.136
a lot of guys that

26:42.987 --> 27:00.136
got medals for doing all kinds of stuff. I knew a guy 
that got the Medal of Honor. And he told me that he,

27:02.393 --> 27:04.115
you know. He said they needed a hero. So he got the 
Medal of Honor. So he didn't feel like he really

27:08.681 --> 27:11.184
didn't feel like he really. I feel like he probably 
did, but he doesn't feel like he deserves the Medal

27:11.304 --> 27:16.291
of Honor. Didn't know he was going to get it until he 
seen the states thought he's going to get

27:16.311 --> 27:20.296
reprimanded. He was in charge of the helicopter 
outfit. And they had a bunch of helicopters that

27:24.501 --> 27:27.985
made an attack in the DMZ. And when they did, Every 
helicopter he had got shot at, including his, and

27:30.659 --> 27:37.467
lost a lot of men. Do you remember his name? No, I 
don't. And he was wounded. But he shot and killed a

27:41.432 --> 27:45.497
Russian officer in that attack. And anyway, he got 
sent home. And I don't remember his rank. He was a

27:52.225 --> 27:55.009
lieutenant colonel or maybe a colonel. And when he 
got home, they told him he needed to go to

27:56.110 --> 27:59.434
Washington. He was really worried, and he got 
there. His family was there. They presented him

28:02.583 --> 28:05.245
with the Medal of Honor. And he said he had no idea. 
He thought he was in trouble. I have a friend that

28:08.869 --> 28:15.315
was in the Army that received the Medal of Honor. 
And he was a Holocaust pilot. And he didn't feel

28:17.517 --> 28:20.240
that he deserved it either. He said that he was just 
doing his duty the way he felt it. He told me, he

28:26.706 --> 28:28.408
said... Westmoreland, the politicians, 
Johnson, needed heroes really bad because of the

28:28.878 --> 28:38.369
attitude of the American people. And he said he 
felt like that was the reason he got the Medal of

28:38.389 --> 28:42.153
Honor. Now, I think the guy did a tremendous job. 
They killed 400 or 500 enemy troops. Fred

28:48.019 --> 28:57.450
Ferguson, this friend of mine, he took a 
helicopter gunships in and he... protected them

28:58.679 --> 29:03.985
while they landed and brought up a whole bunch of, 
freed a whole bunch of prisoners. And there's a

29:06.028 --> 29:14.558
book that's been written that he's listed in 
there, and he's told me before that he says, I

29:06.028 --> 29:14.558
didn't do nothing. But I really, I think most of 
them do, and they are humble. I think it's just a

29:19.824 --> 29:22.086
question of being humble. There was guys that got 
medals, you know, for Purple hearts were handed

29:24.616 --> 29:26.659
out pretty freely. I knew guys that run through 
fences and got purple hearts, you know. Wounds

29:31.947 --> 29:32.548
received. Did you get a purple heart? No, I didn't. 
You didn't get wounded? That's too fast. I run

29:37.896 --> 29:40.259
backwards too fast. You asked me about fragging. 
Yeah, and you didn't know what I meant. I didn't

29:45.447 --> 29:53.779
until you explained to me what it was, but I didn't 
see that happen.

29:55.582 --> 29:57.044
I had a sergeant. We had to pull what they called a 
QRT, which was a quick reaction team. And what it

30:04.271 --> 30:07.475
was, if we came under attack, we were the first ones 
out. And we had a sergeant that wouldn't lead us.

30:12.820 --> 30:14.742
The reason he wouldn't was because he was afraid 
to. Probably I would have, I hate to say this now,

30:15.683 --> 30:23.732
but a few years ago it wouldn't bother me, but I 
would have probably shot that sergeant. if I'd

30:24.404 --> 30:26.888
ever got the chance. But like I said, my hole 
probably wouldn't have been the only hole. It

30:32.636 --> 30:34.198
probably would have been several. Did he survive? 
I don't know. He was there when I left. Oh, he was

30:37.643 --> 30:40.347
there when you left, yeah. And then the tether 
fences came up right then, so right after I left. So

30:46.274 --> 30:49.659
you weren't there when it got affected? No, I 
missed it a few days. Okay, you were very lucky.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.912
Had they started the B-52 bombings before you 
left? Oh, yeah. Do you think they were effective at

30:59.693 --> 31:00.914
all? Yes, I loved them. Do you think they should 
have been started sooner? Yeah, and I think they

31:04.980 --> 31:07.844
should have been done without any warning. What do 
you mean, warning? They always warned the

31:11.870 --> 31:14.914
villages before they struck the bombs. How'd they 
do that? They'd come in and tell them to get out of

31:16.941 --> 31:18.950
the villages. The Americans were fixing the 
bottom. That was like...
