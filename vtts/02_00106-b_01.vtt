WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:12.712
We still played the Corps game, you know, but when 
you got out there, it was loosened up, and most of

00:02.680 --> 00:12.712
the upperclassmen that came out there were pretty 
good guys, and they were wanting to have fun. And

00:12.792 --> 00:17.457
Bonfire was almost entirely done by the Corps, was 
it? Just about. There was Walton Hall and Hart

00:18.619 --> 00:21.822
Hall. There were some of the civilians, but most of 
it was organized and run by the Corps. Then a senior

00:29.932 --> 00:31.033
ring. Why is an Aggie ring so special?

00:38.675 --> 00:45.984
It's probably as hard to explain as the Aggie 
spirit, but I know in my case, everybody looked

00:38.675 --> 00:45.984
forward. The interesting thing back then is you 
didn't wear a senior ring, and we called it a senior

00:46.004 --> 00:53.554
ring. You didn't wear it unless you were a senior. 
You might have had a lot of hours. You could get it as

00:57.199 --> 01:00.683
a junior, but you did not wear your ring, and now you 
see... lots of juniors that'll have rings that'll

01:00.882 --> 01:25.793
be wearing them but that was another one of those 
traditions in the corps you better be wearing

01:00.882 --> 01:25.793
boots if you're wearing a senior ring the way i 
remember it all right i'm confused you couldn't

01:00.882 --> 01:25.793
get the ring until you had so many hours 90 say 95 now 
but back then uh i don't remember his 95 or what it

01:00.882 --> 01:25.793
was of course we took a lot more hours back then But 
you did not wear it in your uniform as a junior. It

01:29.331 --> 01:32.414
was a senior privilege to wear the Aggie ring. And I 
also remember, speaking of the Aggie ring, I have

01:33.315 --> 01:41.043
what's called the old Army ring, as we referred to 
it. It's the gold, but it's got the dark black

01:41.123 --> 01:44.506
inside it. And now most of the rings you see are the 
shiny rings. Well, we only had one person. I

01:49.011 --> 01:53.055
remember when I was in school, took ammonia and it 
seems like cleaned it out. But now this ring is not

01:53.115 --> 01:56.218
the popular ring. And yours cost how much? I can't 
remember. My boots or my ring, I bought used boots.

02:05.057 --> 02:08.520
One was 30 and one was 60, but it was not. And where 
did you get that money?

02:13.425 --> 02:25.075
Two or three times I went over, and I can't remember 
if I did it for either one of those, but I went over

02:13.425 --> 02:25.075
and took a short-term loan out at the YMCA, and you 
had a period of time to pay them back, and they

02:13.425 --> 02:25.075
wanted you to give a dollar maybe if you borrowed 
$30 or $50, whatever. A lot of times if you're going

02:31.344 --> 02:35.390
to Houston for a court trip, you go over and get $25. 
But they didn't pressure you to pay anything back

02:36.051 --> 02:43.341
other than what you borrowed, but it was kind of 
customary you try to come up with another dollar.

02:45.404 --> 02:51.012
And in terms of your college expenses, did your 
family pay that or did you earn some of it? My family

02:51.329 --> 02:52.210
helped. I worked every summer except when I went to 
summer camp in the oil field, and so I paid a pretty

02:52.291 --> 02:58.962
good portion of mine. I never had an automobile. I 
could have, but I never did ask my father for one

03:00.745 --> 03:07.536
because there were other people that had them. As 
you recall, about how much did a year at A&M cost you

03:08.177 --> 03:11.262
then? You know, it's really, really terrible. I 
don't remember. That's where I'm going to say

03:16.016 --> 03:22.246
again, when you talk to Bo and I'll introduce you to 
him, he can tell you exactly. Do you have any senior

03:23.328 --> 03:27.694
ring stories? Lost it or somebody somewhere at 
some exotic place spotted you, spotted an Aggie

03:28.876 --> 03:34.465
ring? Well, I think, of course, from spending 21 
years in the military, you ran into a lot of other

03:36.217 --> 03:42.683
Aggies. And I'm one of these guys that I always 
watch for the ring. And whether we're in Houston or

03:47.267 --> 03:52.671
wherever, we'll continue to try to see one. And 
I'll talk to a fence post, as my kids say. But I think

03:55.133 --> 04:06.223
most of the stories that you could tell is once you 
spot one, you start talking. I know an Aggie story.

04:10.407 --> 04:14.470
I was stationed at West Point in 65 when I was going 
to get out. The colonel talked me into extending

04:14.550 --> 04:20.115
six months that was our battalion commander, and I 
went up there. He was a West Pointer, and I went up

04:20.155 --> 04:29.364
there, and I worked for a lieutenant colonel that 
was out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky for the summer

04:20.155 --> 04:29.364
named Glenn Mitchell, an Aggie. And then after I 
had...

04:34.874 --> 04:50.497
gotten about halfway through the career course, 
I'd pretty well decided I was going to get out of the

04:34.874 --> 04:50.497
Army the next year, and I went up to Washington, 
D.C. because we had the Friday off to go visit

04:34.874 --> 04:50.497
Branch, and walked into my assignment officer was 
Glenn Mitchell, Lieutenant Colonel now, and he

04:34.874 --> 04:50.497
was a major when I worked for him. Well, he sent me to 
A&M to teach ROTC, so a small world there, you know,

04:50.517 --> 05:00.291
how your life turns around because of this one 
Aggie. But just I think the important thing I could

05:00.271 --> 05:09.859
say about being an Aggie, especially in the 
military, when you went in, there was a reputation

05:10.379 --> 05:14.105
that was there that Aggies do well. And I think when 
you first start off, it's kind of like graduating,

05:14.185 --> 05:20.515
or it was then, graduating from West Point. You 
started off a step ahead of the other lieutenants

05:20.555 --> 05:35.880
because, and of course you had had the experience, 
the summer camp experience and everything else,

05:20.555 --> 05:35.880
which was a little bit more enhanced at summer camp 
because of your previous corps life and

05:20.555 --> 05:35.880
everything. any people treasure their senior 
ring as much or more than any other institution.

05:43.306 --> 05:46.457
And the diploma, I think the diploma too and 
everything, you know. Why is that ring compared to

05:46.698 --> 05:49.127
most Hey, it's hard to say, and you've been over 
here, and you know when we give out rings, and we

05:50.120 --> 05:56.194
might give out 3,000 rings. Let's say, let's drop 
the number to 2,300 like we gave her out the other

05:57.297 --> 06:01.005
day. It is amazing. You will be sitting there for 
three hours handing them out, and young ladies

06:04.173 --> 06:09.124
just go crazy. young men until you say something 
well I think that might be a keeper what do you think

06:09.104 --> 06:23.434
something and then you'll get that gleam in their 
eye but to every student it is it is important and I

06:09.104 --> 06:23.434
think they've feel they've earned it, but I think 
all of a sudden they think they're joining the

06:23.633 --> 06:29.058
brotherhood or the sisterhood or something. And 
it's just the one respected thing that you can

06:29.139 --> 06:37.567
probably put right up there with religion. It's 
hard to explain. I, as an outsider, think one of the

06:41.731 --> 06:52.442
keys is that it has changed so little in design so 
that it is a unifier through the years,

06:53.013 --> 07:03.728
and whether you're a civilian or a corps or whether 
you major in this, that, or the other, it pulls

06:53.013 --> 07:03.728
everybody together. You can start right there 
with the picture of the guy right there. They met in

07:07.072 --> 07:11.899
his room when he was a cadet and came up with the 
design for the ring. And that was before the turn of

07:11.879 --> 07:14.502
the century. And the

07:14.743 --> 07:21.291
ring has changed very little. You do see where the 
Eagles faced a different direction about three

07:21.331 --> 07:25.596
different times. But the class of 30, of course, 
had the stone in it. And if you go to the core center,

07:29.861 --> 07:34.427
you'll find a 29. The quick war story I'll tell you, 
I never got to kush or desert for a couple of weeks

07:34.407 --> 07:45.501
because I didn't know which class had the stone, 
and somebody told me to go see Mr. Gay. I went to see

07:45.901 --> 07:55.133
him, and he picks up the phone and calls Rutter, 
who's the vice president that year, and all I could

07:45.901 --> 07:55.133
think was those sophomores are going to kill me. 
And he said, he didn't know, but he said, call Lou.

07:57.936 --> 07:58.957
And then Mr. Gay called Lou, and Lou told him his 
class of 30. Well, later when I was running the

08:01.499 --> 08:09.887
course center, I had one of the stone, ruby red type 
stones come in in a ring that said 29. And I couldn't

08:09.927 --> 08:18.376
understand that because I had talked to Mr. 
Halbooty, who was the editor of the Longhorn, the

08:09.927 --> 08:18.376
yearbook in 30. And he had said that was the first 
year and then we found out it was from Harvey

08:20.898 --> 08:47.310
Striegler over here in admissions and his father 
had been a transfer student laid out a semester and

08:20.898 --> 08:47.310
he ordered his ring in 1930 but he was originally 
class 29 so but that with that one exception that

08:20.898 --> 08:47.310
year the ring has been basically the same uh senior 
boots you bought used And you paid, you think, $30?

08:49.766 --> 08:56.354
$30 seemed like what I paid, and the advantage of 
that, my roommate had new boots, and he had to shine

08:49.766 --> 08:56.354
the heck out of them. Mine had probably been around 
20 years, and all you had to do was put a little

08:56.374 --> 09:02.080
polish on them, and it'd really shine. And did you 
pass them on? I passed them on to someone for the

09:03.822 --> 09:06.506
same price. I remember just like Midnight's, the 
juniors that we wore, I remember selling mine to

09:06.566 --> 09:13.914
Gary Halter when he was a class behind me. And they 
were? were all the boots the same color then no but

09:15.742 --> 09:42.728
uh we didn't have the uh really really uh dark boots 
that you the riding boots that you see everywhere

09:15.742 --> 09:42.728
else they were most all of them were a mahogany or a 
red or some but there were different different

09:15.742 --> 09:42.728
versions and you wore them officially the first 
time i probably the first time we wore them well we

09:15.742 --> 09:42.728
didn't wear them we didn't wear them except 
football games parades You just didn't wear them

09:43.028 --> 09:44.590
to class. You know, that was, that was considered. 
Final review. Oh, that was, you were king of the

09:49.798 --> 09:58.972
mountain, you know, and not only that about the 
boots, but, but there were so many privileges that

09:49.798 --> 09:58.972
went with that. You could walk on grass anywhere. 
You could walk anywhere you wanted, which may

10:00.815 --> 10:05.222
sound kind of corny, but it was a, Did anybody 
special for you come that junior year when you went

10:05.692 --> 10:11.842
through final review? No one. My family came down 
when I graduated final review my senior year, but

10:13.325 --> 10:20.136
not my junior. How did you feel then, that year? Oh, 
I think I felt, you know, good from the standpoint

10:22.313 --> 10:32.930
that, of course, they came down my senior year, but 
I still had a year to graduate. They came back again

10:32.950 --> 10:35.734
when I graduated and was commissioned. Was the 
weather good for final year? It was good, except my

10:38.339 --> 10:45.570
freshman year, and I don't know if there's ever 
been a time in the last... 60 years that final

10:45.550 --> 10:49.574
review was canceled, but it was canceled in 1959. 
And if you look at the 1959 Aggieland, you'll see

10:50.975 --> 10:55.800
the drill field underwater. We became sophomores 
up against the wall, standing at attention. And

11:01.506 --> 11:05.830
I'll never forget the sophomores said, they 
referred to us now as pissheads. They said,

11:05.870 --> 11:08.153
pissheads, hit your hole. In other words, get out 
of the hall. We're going to play hall hockey.

11:10.555 --> 11:11.676
That's a junior privilege. And we still laugh 
about it because all we could do is now we could

11:12.247 --> 11:16.867
leave the light on. We could walk outside. So if 
they were playing hall hockey, you walk outside

11:18.193 --> 11:21.126
and walk back in. And you could wear your hat in the 
house, so you could put the hat on, look in the

11:21.477 --> 11:28.026
mirror, and you put on a different black belt. But 
the other thing we did my freshman year that was

11:28.787 --> 11:36.557
very, very important, after final review, all the 
freshmen had to carry matches. And you had to have

11:37.158 --> 11:42.204
one more than your age, I think it was, or 
something. And we all went down to the corner of

11:42.224 --> 11:44.507
Dorm 2. And we had a gathering, and we had a little 
bonfire. We burned all the matches. And final

11:49.979 --> 11:55.405
review was not postponed, but was literally 
canceled. And it took them a good while to cancel it

11:55.885 --> 12:00.691
because it just kept raining and raining and 
raining. And we were in dorm two waiting.

12:02.953 --> 12:06.717
Nowadays, I think they'd have it in pouring down 
rain.

12:10.221 --> 12:11.463
Commencement. Why are A&M commencement special? 
Oh, they're definitely special or you wouldn't

12:14.532 --> 12:18.898
see like the one the other day. It's like trying to 
explain a lot of the other things. It's a payback. I

12:25.627 --> 12:38.464
think it's a payback to the parents because the 
smiles and they're always seem to be so happy to be

12:25.627 --> 12:38.464
back here. And the students are proud of this place 
and it's just obvious. But I think when we had

12:42.665 --> 12:56.747
meetings a few years ago and we were talking about 
senior finals, should seniors take finals, the

12:42.665 --> 12:56.747
other side of the coin was that should they have 
diplomas in the tube. Because a lot of people felt

12:57.208 --> 13:01.515
it would be a lot easier to just mail them to them. 
And I'll never forget one of the students telling a

13:01.917 --> 13:08.115
professor when he said, well, at other schools, 
they just mail them and they don't have all this

13:01.917 --> 13:08.115
work. And the young girl said, sir, we're not 
another school. And so it's the same way with

13:11.706 --> 13:15.758
graduation now. I know with my son just graduating 
nearly two weeks ago, to see the majority of the

13:16.025 --> 13:27.821
students there for graduation and to see their 
parents there, it's unbelievable. And some of

13:28.482 --> 13:35.010
them spent a lot of money coming, and everybody is 
important. When you graduated, how many were

13:35.711 --> 13:40.918
there to see you graduate? From my family, only my

13:42.518 --> 13:48.989
father and my stepmother. Who else was there? I 
think that most of the people, most of the people in

13:52.036 --> 14:08.037
my outfit had had family members come and had aunts 
and uncles, especially if you were from Fort

13:52.036 --> 14:08.037
Worth, Dallas, Austin, where it was driving 
distance. Motels just didn't exist. It was really

14:09.760 --> 14:10.481
tough. You, it kind of goes back to a lot of the other 
things we were talking about. You knew a professor

14:15.307 --> 14:26.058
that you got to know, and I know that my family, the 
last stop we made leaving town was out at Mr.

14:15.307 --> 14:26.058
Penberthy's house because he was like a godfather 
to me, you know, here. And your name was called,

14:27.480 --> 14:35.689
your hand was shaken, and

14:27.480 --> 14:35.689
you received your diploma. In other words, it 
wasn't a piece of paper. With my name on it, mm-hmm,

14:38.452 --> 14:40.774
and the degree. Did anybody attempt any kind of 
pranks or hijinks at commencement? No, I don't

14:45.981 --> 14:47.644
remember anything. We had commissioning also, 
and I don't remember anything. I don't remember

14:53.254 --> 14:58.143
the people writing things on top of their hats. 
There might have been.

15:02.451 --> 15:06.137
I just remember, of course, I remember final 
review. which was very interesting because we

15:07.535 --> 15:13.144
always had the whooping and the yelling when 
they'd say pass and review. Otherwise, it was

15:13.705 --> 15:15.988
pretty military up until that time. And of course, 
it seemed like we always had a lot of people passing

15:16.168 --> 15:22.378
out because it was so hot and a lot of them had been 
out drinking. And I'd be surprised if you remember

15:23.640 --> 15:29.429
the name of the commencement speaker. Most people 
don't. Commencement, I don't, but I think General

15:30.811 --> 15:34.116
Cassidy was the commissioning speaker. 
commencement speaker, I don't remember. And I

15:38.297 --> 15:41.481
should because I've heard that mentioned so many 
times. At that point, how well did you feel A&M had

15:42.182 --> 15:48.431
prepared you for your future? Oh, I felt very 
secure about going into the military because we'd

15:48.451 --> 15:58.905
been to summer camp and we had done so well And I 
think we'd gotten a lot of additional training

15:59.510 --> 16:11.972
here, and you knew at that time the military 
situation in the world was changing, and I may have

15:59.510 --> 16:11.972
been different. But it's kind of like I said, I'd 
worked five summers in the oil field, and I was kind

16:12.033 --> 16:22.311
of looking forward to the thought of seeing 
something outside of Jack County, because I had I

16:23.472 --> 16:29.980
was 30 years old before I ever saw the Alamo, so 
that's hard to believe you could have come to

16:23.472 --> 16:29.980
school here at A&M. Were you the first in your 
family, first generation in your family to

16:31.142 --> 16:36.249
graduate from college? I was the first to 
graduate, yes. And at the time you got your A&M

16:38.892 --> 16:45.160
degree, what did you think you were going to do 
professionally? Well, I thought that I would go

16:45.832 --> 16:59.319
into the service and I was going to go back and work 
with my daddy who ran cattle and we had a lot of goats

16:45.832 --> 16:59.319
and I just planned on going back to Jacksonville. I 
had no intentions of staying in. No, and if I hadn't

17:01.884 --> 17:06.253
have been stationed at West Point, I went up there 
and It extended six months, and then I volunteered

17:06.807 --> 17:10.812
to go to Vietnam. And so then the next thing I knew, I 
spent 31 of the next 40 months in Nam, and came back

17:11.172 --> 17:20.223
here, taught ROTC, and met my wife in graduate 
school. And then all of a sudden, the military,

17:20.283 --> 17:30.656
here I'd been in 10 years, and the military all of a 
sudden was probably the best decision I could

17:20.283 --> 17:30.656
make. Of course, stay in, because. All right, look 
back now over your life. and interpret it in terms

17:37.908 --> 18:06.244
of what you now realize that a m did to prepare you 
for that life how well did a m prepare you and in what

17:37.908 --> 18:06.244
ways did they prepare you well well i would like to 
go back as when we had our discussion before i wish i

17:37.908 --> 18:06.244
had applied myself better academically when i was 
small my uh Mother died when I was young. I was

18:07.594 --> 18:17.971
really raised by my grandmother and so I didn't 
have any foundation for academics in high school

18:07.594 --> 18:17.971
at all or you couldn't go back to junior high. So I 
wish I had really known how to study or had been

18:18.312 --> 18:24.402
forced to apply myself better not procrastinate 
and things like that so I think that that probably

18:24.382 --> 18:49.444
I'd like to start there and but on the other hand is 
as your friend McCandless tells me he thinks I

18:24.382 --> 18:49.444
turned out all right considering but the bottom 
line is I think that it prepared me more than any

18:24.382 --> 18:49.444
just to deal with people communicate with people 
to and to be conscientious now you may not you may

18:49.424 --> 19:19.127
not be the most eloquent person you may not be able 
to to do a lot of things other people can do but i

18:49.424 --> 19:19.127
think a m taught you that number one you got a job to 
do get the job done but don't step on other people's

18:49.424 --> 19:19.127
toes and if you have a problem there's somebody 
that you can ask for help you know and i think i think

18:49.424 --> 19:19.127
when you go back and you start looking at the five 
years you were here in school There were a lot of

19:19.563 --> 19:23.811
problems, but there were always solutions, and 
there was always somebody. It might have been your

19:24.372 --> 19:32.827
buddy, and it might have been this bonding 
together on different projects or different

19:24.372 --> 19:32.827
pranks or whatever. So you're saying, you're 
implying that it taught you to be a team player?

19:38.297 --> 19:40.120
Team player. And have faith in yourself, too, 
because you can very easily feel that you're not

19:40.471 --> 20:00.528
capable of doing a lot of things, but when you go 
through four years of the Corps, where each year

19:40.471 --> 20:00.528
you're forced to take on new responsibilities or, 
on the same line, privileges that come with it. Did

20:01.450 --> 20:03.373
it teach you how to judge people? I think it 
probably taught you maybe not to judge people as to

20:05.243 --> 20:15.017
judge people, you know, unless you're really sure 
about the people. Don't take a quick decision over

20:15.077 --> 20:17.800
something. Judge is not the right word. I used the 
wrong word. But you, we came here, we came to Texas

20:21.025 --> 20:29.817
A&M, and the one thing you learned that most of the 
people that you dealt with you could trust them or

20:29.797 --> 20:50.860
you knew you couldn't trust them right off the bat 
but you learn to give the benefit of the doubt to

20:29.797 --> 20:50.860
people and but you also learned in a hurry if 
somebody is the is a all these quickie salesman's

20:29.797 --> 20:50.860
is trying to get over on you or something like any 
can you depend on somebody And it was pretty

20:51.683 --> 20:59.932
obvious in my career when I first went in the 
military, and you normally would have four or five

20:51.683 --> 20:59.932
lieutenants. Well, it was pretty obvious if these 
people could be depended on. Because lots of times

21:05.318 --> 21:12.646
if they're going to cover for you or they're going 
to help you on a project, you've got to have their

21:05.318 --> 21:12.646
participation. When I used the word judge, what I 
was really trying to phrase was, When you're

21:19.460 --> 21:33.115
trying to evaluate,

21:19.460 --> 21:33.115
to judge, to figure out who you can work with and who 
you can't, I'm assuming that A&M taught you that

21:35.592 --> 21:44.731
their last name, where they worship, their 
family's income are not important. That's what I

21:44.791 --> 21:47.296
was driving at. Oh, yeah. No question, but I think 
back of guys like the average cadet here is going to

21:48.859 --> 21:55.052
room probably with three people, maybe four 
people, in a period of four years here. Whereas if

22:01.240 --> 22:09.431
you're a civilian student, chances are you're 
going to do the very same thing because you're

22:01.240 --> 22:09.431
going to be living in the dorm, and then you're 
going to live off campus. So you deal with a lot of

22:09.471 --> 22:12.254
people. The advantage of the Corps is you just 
become very, very close with a large number of

22:12.274 --> 22:18.422
people. In other words, you have a lot of roommates 
that may not be sharing the same room with you, But

22:22.454 --> 22:26.479
you're sharing a lot of hours each day together. So 
you do get to pretty well look at somebody and say,

22:26.559 --> 22:35.071
well, he's a good guy. He may be rich, may be poor. If 
you were a consultant to A&M's leadership now,

22:47.294 --> 22:56.696
What advice would you give them about A&M, what 
they should do regarding it to make A&M's future

22:47.294 --> 22:56.696
strong, bright, positive? Well, I would say the 
very first thing I would do, I would have a pretty

22:57.157 --> 23:03.953
good group of consultants volunteer type people 
that love A&M that can give you advice and be very

23:04.658 --> 23:33.315
very careful don't don't just listen to the one 
that yells the loudest on the other hand I think

23:04.658 --> 23:33.315
you've got to sit down and you've got to realize 
that just how important and you've talked about

23:04.658 --> 23:33.315
this over and over some of the older ags what they 
felt it was like when they were here but but you do

23:04.658 --> 23:33.315
have to have this income If we're going to do 2020 
for an example, which we hope we were able to

23:33.295 --> 23:44.752
accomplish everything, but even some of the 
majority items there, it's going to take money.

23:45.353 --> 23:56.028
And you don't want to offend someone over some 
small tradition or some small area that just

23:45.353 --> 23:56.028
because somebody would have come and said, oh, 
that's not important. Well, it might be very, very

23:56.048 --> 23:58.552
important to someone. But I think the...

24:02.168 --> 24:15.522
The only advice I'd really say is get a lot of advice 
and then weigh it, but find somebody that you can at

24:02.168 --> 24:15.522
least trust that you can talk with and get their 
judgment because those people are around, and a

24:02.168 --> 24:15.522
lot of them are retired. If

24:15.542 --> 24:29.256
you had the financial capability to make a major 
gift to A&M, for what purpose would you want your

24:15.542 --> 24:29.256
gift used?

24:32.645 --> 24:53.449
Well, I think if I was giving a major gift to A&M, I 
would want it to go to

24:32.645 --> 24:53.449
students that wouldn't exactly be in the needy 
category, but students that are really having to

24:32.645 --> 24:53.449
work to come to school. If you could say, you know, 
there's some kids pulling down two jobs. If there

25:00.498 --> 25:02.500
was a way you could really know that not based on how 
much income this family makes because the family

25:02.952 --> 25:07.841
may have a lot of children. I would want it based on 
sophomores that have done fairly well

25:07.861 --> 25:21.485
academically but have a definite need, financial 
need, and I wouldn't go back and look at what their

25:07.861 --> 25:21.485
families make or anything like that. Would their 
major matter? Their major wouldn't matter. The

25:27.961 --> 25:31.494
hardest thing would be how do you identify these 
students? How do you identify that a student

25:31.835 --> 25:36.874
really needs something? we usually say well are 
they driving a new car well yeah a lot of kids are

25:37.040 --> 26:01.461
driving new cars that's why a lot of kids are having 
to work make these car payments but but i think i

25:37.040 --> 26:01.461
think really we've got the extremes we've got the 
kids that make the excellent grades get

25:37.040 --> 26:01.461
scholarships the kids that are needy get 
scholarships and i see so many kids that that are in

25:37.040 --> 26:01.461
the middle that are having to having to work their 
tails off and they're not able to study although I

26:02.065 --> 26:12.258
will say that my son this last semester carried 18 
hours and five of them were in engineering, the

26:02.065 --> 26:12.258
other in economics, and he did very well because he 
stayed busy. But it does hinder a lot of kids.

26:19.928 --> 26:27.297
Getting near the end of that, to what former 
students, faculty, advisors, to what

26:19.928 --> 26:27.297
individuals as you look back on your student days, 
do you feel most grateful and why? Oh, I think I've

26:33.792 --> 26:39.487
talked about the three people that I was fortunate 
enough to work for in intramurals. I think the the

26:44.978 --> 27:01.738
professors that I had, and most of them were in the 
College of Agriculture, even though they carried

26:44.978 --> 27:01.738
on over into educational psychology, but those 
people taught the classes, not, not, I didn't have

26:44.978 --> 27:01.738
a student, or other assistant teaching that class 
such as a ta the i had the i had the the professor and i

27:02.967 --> 27:31.388
think and i think most cases we had the professors 
in in in my days in nearly all the classes but uh were

27:02.967 --> 27:31.388
there did you have any as a student did you have any 
experience that you now know that that experience

27:02.967 --> 27:31.388
was a real fork in the road Well, I think Dr. Potts 
put me on probation to go to class. You know, I think

27:35.575 --> 27:41.704
I had been here two years, and I was surprised 
anybody even knew I was in school, you know,

27:35.575 --> 27:41.704
really. So that was very... Oh, very, very 
beneficial. And I have done that to many, many

27:46.071 --> 27:49.235
cadets that I've caught. I've put them, which I 
legally couldn't probably do over in the

27:49.275 --> 27:53.882
Commandant's office, But I put a number of 
students on no cut. And I've taught the class how to

27:56.193 --> 27:59.962
succeed in college. And I would always say, you get 
one absence in my class, period, period. And I got

28:06.255 --> 28:07.819
away with it. But they came to class because they 
understood. Goodness knows what we've

28:13.015 --> 28:14.978
overlooked. I hope we haven't overlooked much. 
Well, my last question is, what feelings do you

28:16.179 --> 28:24.210
carry in your heart today for Texas A&M? Well, I 
think I carry like most of them do. I think one of the

28:28.716 --> 28:33.943
problems that I have is I live here. I hear 
everything and I sometimes think it'd be so nice to

28:34.700 --> 28:58.564
be away from here with just good memories and not 
not having to pick up the paper in here and listen to

28:34.700 --> 28:58.564
whether whether it could be a former student 
that's upset and if they are all upset they got

28:34.700 --> 28:58.564
email now and you have to listen to everything so I 
still think I uh I have the same love for A&M I've

28:58.544 --> 29:02.932
always had. I have a love for the Corps. I just think 
that I'm here where I hear too many negatives now

29:04.515 --> 29:11.247
and hear people complaining and griping about 
everything. And nearly everything, for an

29:11.327 --> 29:17.117
example, the Faculty Senate does is, I think, is 
outstanding because that's why we're here. We're

29:17.137 --> 29:18.139
here for academics. But every once in a while, you 
might have a meeting of the whole, or somebody

29:18.625 --> 29:22.108
brings out something. Then your blood starts 
boiling again. And then you think. But that can be

29:25.271 --> 29:33.858
over these 700 student organizations, which some 
of them you say, why in the world do we have that

29:25.271 --> 29:33.858
organization? But you feel very optimistic about 
the future? I feel very optimistic. And as I say, I

29:41.184 --> 29:47.670
think that as long as we continue moving with the 
students, being involved like they are, we're in

29:48.241 --> 29:52.227
good shape. And proud and grateful. Proud and 
grateful. And as long as the girls stay in the

29:54.531 --> 30:03.464
leadership roles like we've been seeing lately, 
it's going to work well. I throw that out not only as

30:04.025 --> 30:09.654
a joke, but there's a lot of truth to it, too. Let's 
quit there.
