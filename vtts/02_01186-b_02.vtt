00:02.309 --> 00:12.320
Going to undergraduate school, the head of the 
astronomy department asked me who was John Jason

00:02.309 --> 00:12.320
Nassau, or Jason John Nassau, I guess.

00:15.863 --> 00:20.088
Invited me to come and work at the observatory, for 
what reason I do not know. Anyway, I did during my

00:20.128 --> 00:31.320
junior and senior years there, and when I 
graduated, he asked me what I was going to do with

00:20.128 --> 00:31.320
myself, and since I didn't know, he offered me an 
assistantship at Case in the astronomy

00:31.739 --> 00:36.966
department to get my master's degree. And I did 
that, and then went to work for NACA. And

00:41.993 --> 00:50.885
eventually NACA became NASA, and they were 
interested in astronomy, so they sent me back to

00:41.993 --> 00:50.885
get a Ph.D. at Case in astronomy. So you were at 
what, Lewis Research Center? I went to the Lewis

00:53.428 --> 00:55.371
Flight Propulsion Laboratory. And what did you do 
while you were there? I worked for a fellow by the

00:58.275 --> 01:00.818
name of George M. Lowe. He was my section head. And I 
worked on supersonic aerodynamics, both

01:04.454 --> 01:10.261
theoretical and laboratory.

01:13.104 --> 01:16.828
What did you do your PhD thesis on? I did my PhD 
thesis on peculiar and metallic line A-stars,

01:16.848 --> 01:28.101
trying to detect them with a Schmidt objective 
prism images. And who did you do it under? It was

01:30.734 --> 01:32.957
done under Jason Nassau. All right. So you got your 
PhD. What happened then? I got my PhD in 1963. And in

01:41.950 --> 01:59.155
1964, there was a need for somebody to come to NASA 
headquarters and take responsibility for

01:41.950 --> 01:59.155
programming planetary astronomy at NASA 
headquarters. I was invited to do so by a Dr. Erner

01:59.995 --> 02:09.546
Liddell, who was the chief scientist for the lunar 
and planetary program at NASA headquarters. Do

02:10.367 --> 02:15.093
you have any idea how he found you? I understand 
later that he found me through Nancy Roman. I had

02:20.339 --> 02:23.623
been on Nancy Roman's astronomy advisory 
committee since 1958, I believe. As the Lewis

02:27.369 --> 02:28.630
representative? As the Lewis representative. 
When you got to headquarters, as I recall, that was

02:32.195 --> 02:42.467
about the time that there was the first little 
crunch in funding. And then your budget got bigger

02:44.109 --> 02:48.574
for a number of years. Is that correct, or would you 
tell us what happened?

02:54.164 --> 03:07.000
I was unaware of the initial crunch in funding 
because I was just coming in, and the numbers that

02:54.164 --> 03:07.000
I'd seen were so tremendous to me, more like a 
fortune than in French. The budget did get bigger

03:07.020 --> 03:13.529
with time as planetary astronomy took on more and 
more importance. I don't recall right at the

03:15.731 --> 03:21.639
moment when the first significant budget crunch 
came after that. I'd have to look at the record.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.279
Yeah. Well, that's 10 years after I came.

03:29.885 --> 03:33.690
Let me ask a more general question. What do you 
think is the most important thing you did while you

03:34.451 --> 03:41.880
were

03:34.451 --> 03:41.880
headquartered? I think the most important, well, 
it is a very difficult question to answer for a

03:41.900 --> 03:49.169
couple of reasons. When I came to headquarters, it 
was the feeling of the division director Mr. Oren

03:54.492 --> 04:02.785
Nix at that time, that ground-based planetary 
astronomy had seen its better days. And I was

04:05.068 --> 04:20.432
informed when I arrived here that he would like to 
say that he would give me some sort of a permanent

04:05.068 --> 04:20.432
position here, but all he could give me was a 
temporary position because planetary astronomy

04:05.068 --> 04:20.432
was just about terminated. soon everything was 
going to be done from spacecraft and there was no

04:21.273 --> 04:50.335
going to be no need for anything to be done from the 
ground and he was looking for somebody to come in

04:21.273 --> 04:50.335
and basically close out the program that of course 
never happened the importance of planetary

04:21.273 --> 04:50.335
astronomy while low for a while there became more 
and more significant and finally was if I may say

04:50.922 --> 04:57.508
so, competitive with the planetary spacecraft. 
And I think a lot of this was due to the fact that the

04:59.029 --> 05:12.602
instrumentation we had available, the 
techniques we had available, and the interest of

04:59.029 --> 05:12.602
the professional astronomers turned towards 
planetary observations. When I came on board, it

05:13.923 --> 05:19.208
was very difficult to get anybody to make 
planetary observations. and you'd go around

05:19.930 --> 05:28.923
almost begging people, if we give you some money, 
you know, in return for this, would you make an

05:19.930 --> 05:28.923
observation for us? Well, this changed with some 
of the initial successes in the flight program. It

05:36.413 --> 05:49.431
also changed not only because of that, but because 
instrumentation became available that we were

05:36.413 --> 05:49.431
able to turn onto planetary problems that people 
hadn't used for planetary problems before, and

05:36.413 --> 05:49.431
they suddenly discovered that this was something 
that was scientifically interesting. The other

05:54.532 --> 06:12.512
thing that happened, well, I would say, 
therefore, that the resurgence or actually not a

05:54.532 --> 06:12.512
resurgence, but a genuine growth in planetary 
observations from the ground was probably one of

05:54.532 --> 06:12.512
the most exciting things that happened during the 
time I was here. And I would say today, as has been

06:13.653 --> 06:19.519
true for probably the last 15 years or so, the 
amount of research we can do in the planetary area

06:19.887 --> 06:33.484
or in the solar system area is limited more by the 
number of dollars we can put into it than by the

06:19.887 --> 06:33.484
people or the instrumentation that's available. 
So it's still being a very productive aspect of the

06:34.545 --> 06:39.891
overall program. The other thing that I was 
involved with, which went along with this but I

06:41.033 --> 06:49.303
think was also independently very valuable, was 
the construction of major instrumentation

06:49.604 --> 06:59.499
throughout the country, opening up new sites that 
were not opened before. And interestingly

07:00.320 --> 07:19.088
enough, it came about to a large extent because

07:00.320 --> 07:19.088
the National Science Foundation, who had been the 
primary

07:00.320 --> 07:19.088
financer of development of major 
instrumentation for astronomy, or for

07:19.979 --> 07:33.114
planetary, well, for all astronomy, made, I 
think, an unwritten decision that they were going

07:19.979 --> 07:33.114
to focus their attention on certain locations. 
And so the major instruments that they built, they

07:34.095 --> 07:43.766
built in places like the Kitt Peak and Saratololo 
and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.

07:44.427 --> 07:49.513
But they had a few specific locations that they 
invested a large portion of their money in. In the

07:54.465 --> 08:08.720
area of planetary astronomy, we had a different 
objective, and that is that we needed to get major

07:54.465 --> 08:08.720
telescopes at locations which were optimized for 
planetary observations.

08:12.043 --> 08:18.910
Now, this had at least two aspects to it, possibly 
and probably even more. One aspect to it was that we

08:20.813 --> 08:31.123
wanted to put telescopes where there were people 
who had strong interest in planetary

08:20.813 --> 08:31.123
observations.

08:32.224 --> 08:44.015
And this led to the development of major 
telescopes in Texas, in Arizona, and a couple of

08:32.224 --> 08:44.015
other ones around. Well, Hawaii came in for a 
different reason. The other one was we wanted

08:48.438 --> 08:54.766
telescopes located for optimal planetary 
observations. And getting as close to the equator

08:56.428 --> 09:06.741
made Hawaii an extremely important location. In 
particular, when Mars is closest to the south of

09:07.082 --> 09:11.547
the celestial equator. Right. It's in the United 
States. It is as close to the equator as we could get

09:14.371 --> 09:17.635
in a available location and it was also separated 
from California and Texas by in longitude by

09:18.273 --> 09:46.440
significant distance and the advantage of this is 
that if you're looking at a planet which has a

09:18.273 --> 09:46.440
rotation period let's say similar to the earth or 
even one like Jupiter that doesn't have it similar

09:18.273 --> 09:46.440
you can see a different side of the planet from a 
site that's located at a sizable difference in

09:46.927 --> 09:49.310
longitude. Also, the weather patterns differ 
significantly enough so that you want to separate

09:49.851 --> 09:58.423
your telescopes significantly in longitude. We 
have run planetary patrols where we've actually

09:59.325 --> 10:09.419
run telescopes in places like Australia and 
India, as well as in Hawaii and throughout the

09:59.325 --> 10:09.419
United States. So longitude distribution is a 
very important thing in planetary observations.

10:16.677 --> 10:22.806
ask you something that's a little out of whack 
here, but I don't want to miss it. Two-part

10:23.387 --> 10:24.969
question. Do you think planetary astronomy was 
considered second-rate astronomy by the, quote,

10:24.989 --> 10:36.446
astronomical establishment in the USA when you 
started, and do you think it still is? The answer to

10:36.466 --> 10:38.749
both those questions is yes. I think it has 
received a great deal of respectability And it is

10:45.652 --> 10:53.883
now looked at with some considerable respect by 
many different types of astronomers. But to many

10:54.464 --> 11:01.594
astronomers who are interested in stellar and 
galactic work, it's still considered a

10:54.464 --> 11:01.594
second-rate citizen. The reason I asked that was 
your comment about trying to get people, you know,

11:01.914 --> 11:07.542
here's the money, will you observe? And they turn 
you down. I had exactly that experience. Yes. And

11:11.708 --> 11:13.490
it's frustrating as all get-out. Right. And we had 
it for years. Let me ask you two questions here,

11:16.718 --> 11:24.030
because there are two important people I can't 
interview. One is Kuiper and one is Harlan Smith,

11:24.731 --> 11:30.140
and so I have to go around and ask people about them. 
So let's start with the grand old man, Kuiper,

11:30.180 --> 11:34.867
Gerard Peter Kuiper. What was he like?

11:39.354 --> 11:41.578
Well, he talked a lot. He talked a lot and had an 
unlimited number of ideas, many of which were not

11:43.195 --> 11:50.721
good, but many of which were very good. And on the 
average, I think he had some wonderful ideas. He

11:56.106 --> 11:57.287
was a great promoter. He was a great seller of 
Gerard Kuiper. He had unlimited interest in

12:02.111 --> 12:08.396
astronomy, but especially in planetary 
astronomy. And he was a real salesman. He was a real

12:13.773 --> 12:15.335
innovator. Our whole reason for going over to 
Hawaii was Gerard Kuiper. That was his idea

12:23.065 --> 12:26.209
originally, wasn't it? Yes. In fact, he did the 
first work on it. How did he get frozen out of that?

12:34.339 --> 12:41.788
When NASA decided to put a significant-sized 
telescope over in Hawaii,

12:42.511 --> 12:45.395
Gerard Carper was very interested in doing it. 
However, there was some concern expressed that

12:46.056 --> 13:00.114
his empire was growing bigger than we felt that he 
could appropriately handle, based to a large

12:46.056 --> 13:00.114
extent on the fact that we had worked with him in 
Arizona. He had built a telescope in Arizona, but

13:00.475 --> 13:11.910
his ideas were always going on and on, new places, 
new sites, and we didn't think at that time that he

13:00.475 --> 13:11.910
might put as much personal attention into the 
Hawaii telescope as we would like to see it have. He

13:18.757 --> 13:26.289
wanted to operate it basically as a field station 
of Arizona, and he also wanted to use a relatively

13:18.757 --> 13:26.289
small telescope. We were interested in a slightly 
larger telescope. Here I'm talking of the

13:29.193 --> 13:37.426
difference between something on the order of 82 
inches versus, he was talking 60 inches. He wanted

13:38.127 --> 13:40.210
to duplicate Tucson telescope over in Hawaii. At 
that time, we also involved a fellow from Harvard,

13:43.630 --> 13:54.266
Don Menzel, in the possibility of operating a 
telescope in Hawaii.

13:57.471 --> 13:59.814
How did you approach the University of Hawaii? At 
the time, they had no astronomers. They had some

14:01.297 --> 14:06.124
solar astronomers, which is a different world 
than we're used to. How did that get going? Did you

14:08.027 --> 14:10.230
do it, or did someone else do it? In those days, you 
must remember that most of the initiatives that

14:10.885 --> 14:20.975
took place were generated here.

14:24.519 --> 14:38.833
Unlike the National Science Foundation, who 
responds to the community, NASA has always, or at

14:24.519 --> 14:38.833
least for a long time, been in the position of 
initiating programs. And it was decided in NASA

14:40.282 --> 14:56.882
that we needed a major telescope at an excellent 
site

14:40.282 --> 14:56.882
separated in longitude and in weather pattern 
from the ones that were already available in Texas

14:40.282 --> 14:56.882
and in California. Hawaii looked wonderful. And 
it had the original tests on Hawaii that were made

14:59.986 --> 15:09.698
by Gerard Kuiper with his small telescope located 
over on Mauna Kea. showed that the telescope, that

15:11.062 --> 15:15.088
that would be a very good site. Also, he did a very, 
he, Dr. Kuiper, did a very excellent job of selling

15:15.909 --> 15:23.760
Hawaii as a good site. We then tried to figure out 
what would be the best approach in developing a

15:25.022 --> 15:34.196
site over there. And as I said, we talked to Dr. 
Kuiper and we talked to Don Menzel at Harvard. We

15:40.019 --> 16:01.542
also, when I say we here, it's not so much me, it's 
more Erna Liddell, called in John Jeffries from

15:40.019 --> 16:01.542
Hawaii, who, although they had relatively little 
experience with telescopes at that time, were

15:40.019 --> 16:01.542
interested in getting involved in telescopes. 
And John Jeffries, as you know, is also quite a good

16:02.483 --> 16:09.570
salesman.

16:10.377 --> 16:26.898
The decision was made for several reasons, but 
mainly because we felt that Hawaii would place

16:10.377 --> 16:26.898
more personal interest in a telescope there than 
either Harvard or Arizona.

16:28.921 --> 16:39.675
The decision was made to go with John Jeffries 
because he was going to duplicate a Kitt Peak

16:28.921 --> 16:39.675
telescope the 84-inch,

16:40.330 --> 16:52.586
and he was going to make use of people with some 
experience, like Hans Bosgaard and others who had

16:40.330 --> 16:52.586
had telescope building experience. So we simply 
took a chance on him. And it worked. And it worked.

16:59.996 --> 17:04.242
Let me ask you about another character, Harlan J. 
Smith. What was Smithy like? Well, Smith is also a

17:06.865 --> 17:09.088
tremendous salesman. And when I came on board 
here, he had already talked Erna Liddell and maybe

17:09.828 --> 17:30.472
Ron Shorn and Roger Moore into having him 
duplicate a telescope at the University of Texas,

17:09.828 --> 17:30.472
a large telescope for planetary purposes. And as 
was well known at that time, it was difficult to get

17:32.014 --> 17:38.502
people to make planetary observations. And so the 
fact that somebody with some clout, some

17:39.258 --> 18:07.712
authority, and a great deal of interest and 
personal responsibility here saying, let me

17:39.258 --> 18:07.712
duplicate a telescope and put it here and use it 
primarily for planetary purposes at this, what

17:39.258 --> 18:07.712
appeared to be a very good site, was received 
eagerly. back here at NASA headquarters. And when

18:11.141 --> 18:21.737
I came on board, all the paperwork was already in 
motion for the telescope at the University of

18:11.141 --> 18:21.737
Texas. An inch to begin with. No, it was a smaller 
telescope. It was a smaller telescope. Harlan

18:26.765 --> 18:28.107
found a blank. A blank, 107-inch. And that's the 
reason it went up to 107-inch. It was originally

18:31.813 --> 18:33.936
84-inch. and basically it was going to be a 
duplicate of the one that was at Kitt Peak. Same

18:40.239 --> 18:44.184
thing that John Jeffries was going to do with 
Hawaii. And then Harlan wanted to go to a different

18:45.386 --> 19:02.669
mounting system, and then he found the blank, a 
much larger blank, and came in and convinced, in

18:45.386 --> 19:02.669
quotes, us that it wasn't going to cost us any more 
money to build the larger telescope. Now, Harlan

19:04.797 --> 19:14.209
Smith, and I got this in black and white, but he said 
it many times in person, said the biggest mistake

19:04.797 --> 19:14.209
he ever made was that he had two bids. One was for 
Bowler and Chivins, which was the higher bid

19:14.370 --> 19:18.195
initially. It was a turnkey operation that 
delivered an operating working telescope. The

19:21.359 --> 19:25.104
other one was from Westinghouse, which was like a 
million dollars cheaper. And he picked

19:26.505 --> 19:32.273
Westinghouse, and to his dying day, he regretted 
it as I'm sure you still do to this day. We still do to

19:34.232 --> 19:37.537
this day. I was observing at McDonnell at the time a 
lot, and it must have been horrible for you. Well,

19:45.809 --> 19:46.330
it was. It was horrible, and the cost went way up on 
it. And finally, we had to say, okay, we, NASA

19:50.276 --> 20:00.572
headquarters, are going to basically be the 
monitor on this telescope. And it's unfortunate

20:01.261 --> 20:07.053
for Harlan, but we said, Harlan, we just can't 
leave it to you. And what we did was, let's see, it

20:09.479 --> 20:16.093
was the vice chancellor at the University of 
Texas. What was his name? I forget it offhand. No,

20:20.282 --> 20:20.923
let's see. I know the dean of arts and sciences was 
John Silver. No, no. But this was the guy one step

20:28.517 --> 20:32.944
ahead, and I can't remember the name, but I can look 
it up. And then he went into the whole system after

20:32.964 --> 20:35.308
that. But basically, the difficulty is Harlan 
made all the original contracts.

20:45.423 --> 20:46.985
We had all kinds of problems. He had problems with 
Westinghouse. Westinghouse, all kinds of

20:49.270 --> 20:51.753
problems. The control system didn't work. And so 
they said, and it was more or less saying, trust us,

20:52.875 --> 20:59.283
trust us, trust us. We built nuclear submarines. 
So we finally did two things. We finally pushed it

21:05.431 --> 21:10.998
up above Harlan Smith University of Texas, all the 
way up to the chancellor's office.

21:13.702 --> 21:16.746
And the, I think it was vice chancellor, took 
personal interest in it and attended all reviews

21:17.840 --> 21:23.528
himself of the telescope at Westinghouse. We then 
attended all reviews of the telescope at

21:24.490 --> 21:28.195
Westinghouse. We made Westinghouse report on all 
activities on, it was at least six months, I think

21:28.956 --> 21:38.750
probably at that time, quarterly basis. Harlan 
tells the story that at one time, basically, the

21:39.331 --> 21:47.222
shell of the telescope was laying in a pit at 
Westinghouse with nobody working on it. quite

21:47.455 --> 22:11.742
possibly but we change we tried to change the whole 
thing around and get Westinghouse to pay some

21:47.455 --> 22:11.742
attention to it getting the highest well 
concerned at the highest levels of NASA concerns

21:47.455 --> 22:11.742
are the highest levels of the University of Texas 
we we had these status reviews at Westinghouse. We

22:14.815 --> 22:19.063
had the top-level Westinghouse people there at 
Sunnyvale in on the reviews. We went through all

22:19.543 --> 22:20.806
the problems. They were open to all kinds of 
questions. We questioned them everything,

22:22.408 --> 22:26.976
things that they didn't want to talk about. We went 
through. We had planned tours every so often. We

22:32.045 --> 22:34.749
finally got it straightened out, but it was a real 
mess. The telescope came in way over cost. I mean,

22:38.215 --> 22:40.558
like a million dollars over cost on the mountain. 
In fact, it would have been cheaper to adopt the

22:40.578 --> 22:42.820
bowler in general. Yeah, yeah. It would have been a 
lot faster. And we finally got it built. It's

22:48.507 --> 22:51.530
working fine, but it was a headache to get it built. 
And we decided at that time that if we ever did

22:51.550 --> 22:57.376
another telescope, we would do it in a different 
manner. And we have done other telescopes in a

22:57.797 --> 23:01.521
different manner. There was the Lake Lominden.

23:08.270 --> 23:21.905
attempt by JPL to get about a 60-inch telescope or 
something on Table Mountain, and I know I signed

23:08.270 --> 23:21.905
off on that darn thing, and I thought it was done, 
but it died lousy back in 65 or something like that.

23:21.925 --> 23:23.206
Why did it die? I mean, JPL people wanted it at the 
time. We had, I guess, the biggest planetary

23:27.051 --> 23:32.377
astronomy group in the world.

23:33.858 --> 23:36.021
What happened? As I understand it, the thing that 
happened was a disagreement between

23:38.645 --> 23:42.209
headquarters and Caltech.

23:45.432 --> 23:53.520
And

23:45.432 --> 23:53.520
the people at JPL, which is, in effect, Caltech... 
Sort of. Well, that was one of the difficulties.

24:00.087 --> 24:07.555
We would agree to build a telescope, as we did with 
all our telescopes, as an instrument, but not as a

24:00.087 --> 24:07.555
facility. That meant that we would build the 
telescope, but not the building. And this was

24:15.342 --> 24:23.031
being done through Caltech, not through JPL, 
because we did build many facilities through JPL.

24:23.051 --> 24:25.033
We'd give them the telescope, but not the 
building. They went to upper management here,

24:27.136 --> 24:36.006
went to Caltech, as I remember it, and said, look, 
we'll give you one facility. Do you want the

24:36.745 --> 24:39.890
building for that telescope, or do you want a 
building on campus?"

24:43.877 --> 24:45.961
Caltech said, we want the building on campus. And 
that was the end of the telescope. I've also heard

24:50.528 --> 25:00.525
that Caltech

24:50.528 --> 25:00.525
was interested in building the perfect telescope 
at the perfect in some indefinite future, whereas

25:01.214 --> 25:09.882
NASA obviously wanted to know things like what's 
the surface pressure on Mars, and Caltech could

25:01.214 --> 25:09.882
care less about that. Is that true? That aspect I 
don't remember at all. All I know, and it was in the

25:15.627 --> 25:29.280
records when I got here, it was no longer an active 
program under consideration, so I personally

25:15.627 --> 25:29.280
didn't have anything to do with it, but it had been 
turned down because Caltech basically said, if

25:15.627 --> 25:29.280
that's our building, we don't want it. Well, they 
had plenty of big, most of the big telescopes in the

25:30.897 --> 25:35.943
world already. Yeah, and it was JPL that wanted the 
60-inch telescope. Let's get, and I'm confused

25:41.890 --> 25:52.564
here because the acronyms are ganging up on me, but 
you had a lot to do about an infrared telescope, and

25:41.890 --> 25:52.564
I forget what it's called, the IRTF? Yeah, the 
IRTF. Okay. Back even in the 60s, there was all this

25:55.747 --> 26:00.313
talk about the fact that that's one of the other 
things. So that

26:00.698 --> 26:09.287
has a long story. Can you summarize it in an hour or 
less?

26:15.294 --> 26:28.748
Yes, there actually is a very good two-part report 
on that that came out in Science

26:29.690 --> 26:34.217
and went into a great deal of detail in the 
background of the IRTF.

26:37.482 --> 26:39.965
I have a copy of it around here someplace. But 
anyway, this was the thing. We wanted to get a light

26:42.369 --> 26:58.633
bucket in the infrared, and that was, there was a, 
let's say there was a meeting... By that you mean

26:42.369 --> 26:58.633
not a really superb primary mirror or something, 
just something to collect light and put it on a...

26:58.833 --> 27:12.407
Originally, the astronomers said what we want is a 
large aperture, large mirror light bucket for the

26:58.833 --> 27:12.407
infrared to make infrared observations of the 
planets. What's his name? Hugh Johnson at Arizona

27:15.229 --> 27:27.962
was building metal mirror telescopes, infrared 
light buckets.

27:28.803 --> 27:29.604
Harold Johnson. Harold Johnson. And in addition, 
there was one built at Caltech, Bob Layden. I think

27:37.396 --> 27:39.740
Guido Munch was working with him on that one. And at 
the time, of course, infrared detectors were very

27:40.561 --> 27:45.189
insensitive. And they were doing an infrared sky 
survey. But there was a lot of argument as to the

27:49.075 --> 27:56.346
value of infrared observations for planetary 
work. Now, if you could get resolution, that was

27:57.203 --> 28:02.188
fine, but you didn't think you could get 
resolution. There was a planetary astronomy

28:02.208 --> 28:16.681
study

28:02.208 --> 28:16.681
done at—oh,

28:02.208 --> 28:16.681
what's the name of that? It was published in the 
early 1960s,

28:16.701 --> 28:26.670
and it was, I think, a location that the NSF had New 
England someplace. It wasn't Woods Hole.

28:31.607 --> 28:33.489
It was another location. I don't have a copy of 
the—I have it packed away, and my stuff is in

28:33.529 --> 28:39.476
storage, but I don't have a copy of it here. But 
there was a group put together to look at the

28:39.496 --> 28:49.807
potential of planetary astronomy, ground-based 
planetary astronomy. And one of the things they

28:52.089 --> 28:54.632
came up with was the desirability of having an 
infrared telescope.

29:04.959 --> 29:11.667
That generated our initial interest in infrared. 
It was originally thought to be about a three meter

29:11.687 --> 29:15.531
light bucket.

29:21.018 --> 29:23.961
Then as things improved, the detectors became 
better, The concept changed from a three meter

29:24.413 --> 29:30.604
light bucket to a three meter higher quality 
instrument. Although actually, when the IRTF was

29:31.065 --> 29:38.277
built, we didn't anticipate that the mirror was 
going to be as good as it was.

29:41.723 --> 29:49.797
Now,

29:41.723 --> 29:49.797
there was also a desire to have it in the best 
possible location.

29:53.995 --> 30:11.001
From the experience that we had in the infrared, it 
looked to us as if Hawaii, Mauna Kea, was probably

29:53.995 --> 30:11.001
the best site to put an infrared telescope. So we 
started looking at Hawaii, and Jeffries had

30:11.021 --> 30:17.531
already built the 88-inch telescope. We started 
looking at that site and the University of Hawaii

30:18.112 --> 30:22.939
to do an infrared telescope. on Mauna Kea. There 
was considerable concern expressed by the

30:27.291 --> 30:50.977
community outside

30:27.291 --> 30:50.977
of Hawaii that we were really not doing the 
appropriate analysis of capabilities and sites

30:27.291 --> 30:50.977
if we were going to build a major infrared

30:27.291 --> 30:50.977
telescope. This resulted in a program being 
undertaken, which we did site surveys. I think we

31:00.142 --> 31:03.848
started out with about eight sites, ended up with 
something like five. Jim Westfall at Caltech

31:04.789 --> 31:11.539
handled the actual site survey for us. The sites 
included Mauna Kea, I think White Mountain,

31:14.022 --> 31:24.077
a site in Arizona,

31:28.411 --> 31:32.956
a site in Baja, Cerro Tololo.

31:36.139 --> 31:39.222
There's a report that's out on it. Again, it's 
filed away. When I retired in 85,

31:41.124 --> 31:49.313
some of these things I got copies of, but they're 
all stored away. And I think NASA has copies of all

31:49.353 --> 31:54.559
the reports. Anyway, the things that were looked 
at was the were the water vapor content of the

31:58.145 --> 32:06.413
atmosphere above the site and something called 
infrared noise. And I still think that they don't

32:08.274 --> 32:11.197
understand infrared noise. We had infrared noise 
monitors that were designed by Jim Westfall,

32:12.398 --> 32:25.030
approved by Frank Lowe, and we did water vapor 
studies And we did them for one full year at all of

32:25.280 --> 32:28.243
these sites. A blind survey. The data all came in by 
number, and the analysis were all made by number.

32:36.691 --> 32:45.279
And it wasn't until the analysis were completed 
that the translation of the numbers into sites

32:36.691 --> 32:45.279
were known. But it showed that, except for some 
unusual periods, the best location was Hawaii.

32:55.385 --> 33:01.312
White Mountain looked very good, but 
unfortunately, due to weather, you couldn't do a

32:55.385 --> 33:01.312
continuous observation. They had to keep pulling 
the observers off White Mountain. So Mauna Kea

33:05.897 --> 33:19.753
became the site of favor, although many people 
argued that we were making a mistake by going to

33:05.897 --> 33:19.753
Hawaii because the cost of going up on the mountain 
there was very expensive. The working conditions

33:20.114 --> 33:22.236
were very severe. The number of legitimate 
planetary astronomers were less there, and so

33:23.836 --> 33:33.069
there was a lot of desire to go to a place like 
Arizona. So I think in the actual priority rating

33:33.109 --> 33:53.117
by an outside committee that looked at all the 
results of the site surveys and every one of the

33:33.109 --> 33:53.117
people put in a proposal and they talked about 
logistics and the engineering support and the

33:33.109 --> 33:53.117
university support and everything else, they 
came up and rated Hawaii top Arizona second, and

33:53.452 --> 33:57.817
then the other ones further on down the list. We 
went to Hawaii. We originally were going to build a

34:01.802 --> 34:08.590
fork mounting.

34:11.694 --> 34:12.515
We did a couple of things. One of them is we put 
together a committee of three people, Frank Lowe,

34:12.555 --> 34:21.366
Fred Gillette,

34:23.067 --> 34:33.241
Neugebauer, Gary Neugebauer, to come up with the 
design of a telescope, rough design of a

34:23.067 --> 34:33.241
telescope.

34:33.261 --> 34:44.517
They would like to have a polar mounting

34:33.261 --> 34:44.517
with a north pole and a south pole.

34:47.882 --> 34:49.564
Hawaii wanted to go with a fork.

34:52.328 --> 34:53.790
Finally, Hawaii won out. We went with the design of 
a fork. However, the fork design could not be shown

34:58.115 --> 35:10.572
to satisfy the needs of the infrared observers, 
and we finally went with the floor mounting. So you

35:10.592 --> 35:15.858
have enough room at the bottom end to mount their 
equipment? It was stability more than anything.

35:18.001 --> 35:19.964
Repeatability. The example of the 120-inch. I

35:22.703 --> 35:32.519
mean, you have hysteresis and other serious 
problems. You have flexure and gravitational

35:33.480 --> 35:41.373
deformation of the telescope mount. And even 
though Charlie Jones, who did the design, tried to

35:41.393 --> 35:50.027
convince us that it would There was enough 
question about it, so they changed the design to

35:50.750 --> 35:55.798
the other. And that's important, because a lot of 
these infrared sources are not visible when you

35:57.020 --> 36:05.714
look through an eyepiece, so you've got to know 
where you're pointing. You've got to know where

36:05.734 --> 36:07.056
you're pointing. But there was another reason we 
finally changed the mount design. It had nothing

36:12.084 --> 36:13.186
to do with the mount. It had to do with a cracked 
mirror.

36:20.483 --> 36:42.957
And the problem that we had there was in an attempt 
to save money, NASA came up with a mirror that had

36:20.483 --> 36:42.957
been purchased for testing, not for the space 
telescope, but for testing, for figuring out the

36:20.483 --> 36:42.957
space telescope mirror. And we were given that 
mirror and we're going to use it for the IRTF.

36:52.517 --> 37:10.963
Unfortunately, on the grinding table at Kitt 
Peak, for one holiday, it developed a crack,

36:52.517 --> 37:10.963
and we were forced to go to another replacement 
mirror.

37:14.629 --> 37:16.832
Being forced to go to the replacement mirror 
provided us with an unexpected additional amount

37:17.369 --> 37:27.023
of time to finish the telescope, which was enough 
time to change the design of the mount. You might

37:28.686 --> 37:32.331
say, why this particular concern? We were trying 
to finish the IRTF in time to make measurements of

37:34.835 --> 37:44.068
the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn and of the 
planets themselves prior to the launch of the

37:46.124 --> 37:52.330
Voyager spacecraft. That was probably the main 
driver

37:52.350 --> 38:00.519
on the telescope schedule. When the mirror 
cracked, we were no longer able to meet that

38:02.020 --> 38:06.425
schedule. And even though there were some 
questions about the design of the mount prior to

38:08.867 --> 38:13.752
that, the desire to meet that schedule, because we 
had promised Congress that we were going to meet

38:14.356 --> 38:29.619
that schedule, said, okay, maybe the design mount 
won't work, but to meet the schedule, we'll go with

38:14.356 --> 38:29.619
it. When the mirror cracked and we had to go back and 
replace the mirror, start over again, that gave us

38:30.300 --> 38:39.975
a forced delay in the schedule. that forced delay 
in the schedule was sufficient to allow us to go

38:40.411 --> 38:46.780
back and redesign them out of the telescope. Who 
was the managing institution for the IRT at the

38:46.800 --> 38:53.790
University of Hawaii? University of Hawaii. And 
who runs it now? How is it run now? Okay, it is still

38:57.896 --> 39:03.584
run by the University of Hawaii under contract to 
NASA. It is a NASA facility, completely a NASA

39:03.804 --> 39:07.009
facility. NASA owns and but operated for us by the 
University of Hawaii under my contract. Now,

39:15.269 --> 39:21.798
here's a question that has three parts, but it's 
really only one. As I recall, one of the deals that

39:22.519 --> 39:33.514
Texas got was that they were going to devote a 
substantial fraction of time on what became the

39:22.519 --> 39:33.514
107-inch to planetary observing. But the 88-inch 
at Hawaii, the 107-inch at... McDonald and the

39:38.326 --> 39:44.473
IRTF were funded by NASA. And what fraction of time 
do they have to give to NASA or planetary

39:44.953 --> 39:53.422
observers? I don't remember the specific 
fraction of time, but it was something on the order

39:53.442 --> 40:07.337
of 30 percent of the time on the telescope had to be 
made available for guest observers. that was

40:08.026 --> 40:16.294
people that were not associated with the 
institution that had the telescope. Now, it's

40:16.314 --> 40:30.307
very important to say that the

40:16.314 --> 40:30.307
approach used for both the 107-inch at Texas and 
the 88-inch in Hawaii were quite different than

40:16.314 --> 40:30.307
that used for the IRTF. In both the Texas and 
smaller Hawaii telescope, We, NASA, provided

40:37.253 --> 40:44.603
money to build the instrument, not the building 
and not the dome. They were specifically excluded

40:44.683 --> 40:56.579
in return for paying for the instrument and all 
aspects of the instrument, although we couldn't

40:44.683 --> 40:56.579
pay for the piers. That was part of the building. 
But paying for the instrument plus assuring that

40:58.902 --> 41:04.189
we would provide funding for the operation of the 
telescope, it was agreed that a significant

41:05.063 --> 41:21.899
amount of time on the telescope would be used for 
planetary studies, and something on the order of

41:05.063 --> 41:21.899
30 percent of the time would be made available to 
observers from other institutions. We could not

41:22.700 --> 41:28.246
take government money and give it to one 
institution. They basically had to operate a

41:28.266 --> 41:33.771
facility that was available part of the time for 
other things.

41:37.278 --> 41:48.832
I think it may be, and you'd have to check me on this, 
but my memory says that the agreement was that they

41:37.278 --> 41:48.832
would do planetary research for something like 
30% of the time.

41:51.816 --> 41:57.823
We would pay them something like 30% of the 
operating cost of the telescope, plus providing

41:51.816 --> 41:57.823
them with a telescope in the first place. And a 
certain fraction of that 30% had to be used by

41:59.345 --> 42:06.053
non-institution

41:59.345 --> 42:06.053
people. In the case of the IRTF, that was, from the 
start to the finish, a NASA instrument.

42:14.849 --> 42:19.576
Instrument, building, dome, piers, all NASA. 
100% NASA.

42:24.924 --> 42:29.752
We paid the full operating cost of that telescope 
and continue to do so.

42:32.757 --> 42:35.601
But in return for operating it for us, The 
University of Hawaii gets something like 25% of

42:36.678 --> 42:43.589
the time on the telescope. The division of 
observing time between planetary and

42:43.609 --> 43:00.497
non-planetary, or let's say solar system and 
non-solar system, if we include other things

42:43.609 --> 43:00.497
other than just the planets now, is decided by NASA 
in advance. And it has been something like 50-50.

43:04.943 --> 43:17.657
But NASA reserves the right to increase or 
decrease, as it wishes, the amount of time on solar

43:04.943 --> 43:17.657
system observations, but it has to do so in 
advance. Now, NASA is the sole funder of the IRTF,

43:19.620 --> 43:33.195
with one exception, and that is that the National 
Science Foundation said to NASA, If you say you're

43:33.445 --> 44:01.766
going to operate this as a national facility, 
which is what NASA is doing, we want you to provide

43:33.445 --> 44:01.766
subsidies for the observers similar to those we 
provide at Kitt Peak, Cerro Tololo, NRAO, et

43:33.445 --> 44:01.766
cetera.

44:01.787 --> 44:02.828
We said, fine. But much of the time is going to be 
spent making observations that are not of

44:03.618 --> 44:09.685
interest to NASA.

44:14.952 --> 44:16.334
The NSF said, fine. We will provide the subsidy 
funding for travel, things like this, for the time

44:17.595 --> 44:31.212
not used for NASA programs, if you provide a 
similar amount for NASA programs. So every year,

44:31.647 --> 44:44.502
we get a small amount of money from NSF to provide 
subsidy to the people working on programs not of

44:31.647 --> 44:44.502
interest to NASA.

44:49.187 --> 44:55.414
OK. Let me change the subject here and ask you 
something that's purely an opinion. Back in the

44:55.695 --> 44:57.857
turn of the century, Planetarius Romulus 
respectable subject. By 1930 it was not popular,

45:00.464 --> 45:08.397
in fact even dangerous to be in, according to 
people like Fred Whipple. What do you think killed

45:08.417 --> 45:12.443
it?

45:12.463 --> 45:24.182
I think the thing that killed it was the fact that we 
had just about reached the limit of what could be

45:12.463 --> 45:24.182
done with the instrumentation that was available 
back at the turn of the century.

45:27.487 --> 45:37.076
We had got just about every piece of information we 
could except for just continuing looking at

45:27.487 --> 45:37.076
changing in surface appearance of the planets and 
things like this. What happened to change it was

45:38.217 --> 45:46.906
that when planetary astronomy went out of favor, 
instrumentation development was still taking

45:38.217 --> 45:46.906
place. And very few people use these new 
developments to look at the planets. And in fact,

45:52.692 --> 45:55.114
when I came on board in 64, We were still trying to 
get people to use basically standard techniques

45:55.533 --> 46:00.970
for stellar astronomy.
