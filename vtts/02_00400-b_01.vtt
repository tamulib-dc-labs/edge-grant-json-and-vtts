WEBVTT

00:02.292 --> 00:07.118
Well, say your name again and tell me about your 
father. Well, my name is... Now? Yes. My name is

00:12.445 --> 00:15.008
Graviela Gámez. Yes. And I am the daughter of Juan 
Gámez Sr. and my mother, Mrs. Ramona R. Gámez. My

00:22.257 --> 00:26.662
mother was Reyes for her father. I am Reyes Gámez. 
Well, my father was a military man in Mexico when he

00:30.254 --> 00:37.104
was a carranza. He was a

00:37.124 --> 00:42.452
carrancista. They called them carrancistas. He 
was a carrancista soldier in Mexico. That's why

00:50.404 --> 00:57.595
they came to give the rosary, because that's where 
all the troops were stationed. And that's when

00:58.705 --> 01:02.612
they fought and won Matamoros. That's why from 
Ciudad Victoria to Matamoros is Tamaulipas. It's

01:09.244 --> 01:12.410
the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Because they won 
the war back then. I don't know when the war

01:17.926 --> 01:19.468
started. I think it was 1910. It was the first year. 
Well, it was when I was born. I was a baby. Not a very

01:27.237 --> 01:28.078
small baby. I was a girl. I was born in 1910.

01:36.087 --> 01:40.352
I was born on March 18. And my father was in the 
militia, in the war. He was... Soldado. ¿Para qué

01:47.113 --> 01:49.855
razón entró? Bueno, pues como aquí, you know, lo 
llama el gobierno, tiene que ir. Y allá lo llamó el

01:57.262 --> 02:09.933
gobierno, aunque eran hombres familiares, pero 
tuvieron que, necesidad de ir, porque eran,

01:57.262 --> 02:09.933
tenían, llevaban los soldados, los reclutaban 
como aquí. Es la razón que fueron. Aquí hay muchos

02:13.676 --> 02:16.519
jóvenes que no quieren ir y tienen que ir. Because 
the government calls them. What can they do with

02:19.584 --> 02:21.147
the government? They have to go to the government 
to serve the country. And in Mexico, it's the same

02:25.975 --> 02:27.818
thing. That's why my father was a militant. He was a 
lieutenant. He was a very humble man, but he did

02:37.561 --> 02:47.319
everything very correctly. My uncles, my 
mother's brothers, were also soldiers at that

02:47.459 --> 02:55.534
time. One was the clarinet player, you know, the 
one who plays the clarinet so that all the soldiers

02:56.071 --> 03:03.321
get up. And the other, my uncle, the other, José, 
was the one who carried the flag. Yes. But there in

03:11.373 --> 03:17.522
Mexico, my mother said, all the soldiers were all 
horsemen, they walked on horses, you know. They

03:17.924 --> 03:19.727
were horsemen. They were horsemen. That's how 
they were called, horsemen. And the ones who

03:23.493 --> 03:29.622
brought the other one, as they say, Pancho V was 
very brave. But all of his poor soldiers were

03:30.503 --> 03:32.446
brought on foot. They fought, all on foot. But your 
father was a horse rider. Oh, my father, yes. My

03:39.976 --> 03:42.278
father rode horses, all of them. They were horse 
riders. They were horse soldiers. That's the

03:45.402 --> 03:46.523
name. Horse soldiers, not infantry. The infantry 
are the ones who go on foot, the poor ones. Like your

03:53.591 --> 03:54.432
father. Your family wasn't from the poor. Well, my 
father was a farmer. Yes. A man who worked in the

04:03.963 --> 04:05.565
fields. But they don't call them labores here. 
They call them potreros. For example, the owner

04:14.295 --> 04:20.301
says, I'm going to take a look at the work. And in 
Mexico, he says, I'm going to take a look at the

04:20.341 --> 04:25.846
potrero to see how the land is so they can start 
working. That's what they say in Mexico. Well, my

04:27.988 --> 04:30.691
mom used to tell us. I wasn't very young. I looked at 
how my father worked in Mexico, but my mother

04:34.081 --> 04:37.367
didn't. My father used to talk about why they came 
here to make the rosary. And from there they

04:45.562 --> 04:48.207
worked, they came here to work. And then my father 
sent to bring my mother to Padilla. He wrote to her,

04:52.214 --> 04:58.165
he told her to get ready because he was going to 
bring her. You know,

04:58.887 --> 05:27.493
sobrinos

04:58.887 --> 05:27.493
y familia de la... sisters and all that. But the 
elders of the family, the parents, the older

05:29.904 --> 05:37.271
sisters, they all died. My mother has a sister. We 
have an aunt in Mexico, in Padilla. She's my

05:43.576 --> 05:46.659
mother's sister. She came here about 8

05:46.679 --> 05:56.468
or 9 years ago. Yes, because she came after my 
father and my mother

05:58.608 --> 06:08.419
died. She came to see us. She has a lot that came and 
she didn't come. But she lives. She writes to us

06:14.125 --> 06:18.229
here and there. She sends us a letter. So that she 
knows about us. It's the whole family that we have

06:20.752 --> 06:23.755
on my mother's side. What kind of stories did your 
father tell about his days as a soldier? Soldier? I

06:33.370 --> 06:38.357
don't know, because I think he only talked to my 
mother. I think. We were younger. Yes. The little

06:41.962 --> 06:47.530
ones don't pay attention to what the parents or the 
mother talk about. Yes. They're going to play, or

06:47.731 --> 06:51.616
they're going to do what they're told to do. No. 
Yes, he was a soldier. He fought in Mexico. He

07:01.525 --> 07:03.887
fought here. I have three nephews in the service. 
One was in Thailand. The other one was in Thailand a

07:13.156 --> 07:15.719
month ago. He was there for a year. And the other 
one... But the revolution was especially hard,

07:21.110 --> 07:28.644
right? Yes,

07:29.365 --> 07:44.113
my mom

07:29.365 --> 07:44.113
says so.

07:44.397 --> 07:49.704
And what did your mother do during those years when 
your father was a soldier? Well, they left them

07:50.385 --> 07:53.028
there in the house. They left them there and when 
they could, they sent them money so they could buy

07:53.048 --> 07:59.116
their food. That was all. They didn't go with him? 
No, they stayed there in the farm, in the house. But

08:08.917 --> 08:11.740
they were very afraid. Because in Mexico, it 
wasn't the same war as here. In Mexico, suddenly,

08:16.544 --> 08:23.511
in the middle of the night, all the people were 
sleeping, peaceful. The people who were

08:23.531 --> 08:26.094
civilians, peaceful. And suddenly, when they 
woke up, the soldiers arrived. That's why my

08:30.398 --> 08:31.439
mother was very afraid. All the families, all of 
them. My grandmothers cried a lot for them because

08:37.148 --> 08:48.916
My father's grandmother had already passed away, 
but my grandmother lived with my mother because

08:37.148 --> 08:48.916
she worked with her two children and her 
son-in-law, my father, in the war. Many families,

08:48.936 --> 08:55.090
all the poor families, their husbands, their 
brothers, their children did not come. In the

08:56.065 --> 08:56.986
militia? Yes. In Mexico they say in the militia, 
those who are in the war, they tell us, you're in the

08:58.208 --> 09:12.428
war, or you're a soldier, or you're in the militia, 
or you're in the militia, you're a soldier. A

09:13.670 --> 09:14.330
soldier. A soldier is a soldier who fights with 
weapons. It was very hard. My mother said that the

09:20.018 --> 09:21.941
war in Mexico was very hard. Very, very hard. And 
when...

09:56.191 --> 10:00.037
No, it was in 1909.

10:02.101 --> 10:06.187
When there was an abduction in Mexico. Yes. They 
named him Cyclone. Yes. In what year? In 1909. In

10:13.819 --> 10:14.621
1909. It was before the war. Yes, I think so. It was 
when my grandmother died because she was very

10:17.445 --> 10:21.311
scared. It was when my... Mi hermana chiquita, no, 
yo creo fue menos después, porque mi hermana nació

10:24.153 --> 10:36.467
en 1905, el 25 de febrero. Mi hermana es la que está 
en el pueblo, la mayor de la familia.

10:44.156 --> 10:53.687
Y la inundación esa fue en 1909,

10:44.156 --> 10:53.687
un año antes que naciera yo. Because my sister was 
brought up in Chiquita. And my mother says that it

10:59.894 --> 11:05.043
didn't rain. Suddenly it didn't rain, it was just 
that the water came to the houses and they came to

11:05.063 --> 11:10.733
warn us. That there was a very big crescent. Like 
when the river comes out here. My mother told me

11:17.343 --> 11:23.815
that the trees in the houses did not look so good. 
And they were very afraid because my aunt, my

11:23.835 --> 11:35.495
father's little sister, had gone to the ranch with 
one of her sisters and my grandmother, my father's

11:23.835 --> 11:35.495
mother. And there, in the ranch, the crescent 
fished them. And they started to warn us to leave

11:40.478 --> 11:43.684
the houses. They went up to where they were very 
high, high, if not the highest, because the water

11:44.005 --> 11:51.780
was coming up very cold. And my aunt said that when 
they left the house, she would give the water to

11:51.800 --> 11:55.667
Sina. And she brought a baby of a month of birth, my 
aunt, my little sister and my father. And I know

12:02.703 --> 12:09.832
that they left, and they left where there were high 
and high, and the more bad it was, the water was here

12:02.703 --> 12:09.832
and here. In the body? Yes, they were walking 
through the mountain, and then there were some

12:11.454 --> 12:25.673
very large trees, and a man who was their 
brother-in-law, a brother of a brother-in-law of

12:11.454 --> 12:25.673
my uncle and my father, he was a very good swimmer. 
So he put up a lot of sticks and made them into

12:26.311 --> 12:29.936
sticks. And all the families went up there. He said 
there were 30 families who spent three days there.

12:39.409 --> 12:40.530
Three days? 30 families? Yes, on those sticks. And 
my mother, my grandmother, was going to take my

12:43.054 --> 12:49.062
mother's baby, my little sister. They brought 
something to give to the children. My grandmother

12:53.281 --> 12:55.503
cooked for them. She said, God, where are we going? 
We are going to cook something for these children.

13:00.809 --> 13:05.954
They cooked rice, you know, and they put all the 
juice in a jar to bring to the children. Bebitos to

13:06.094 --> 13:09.358
give them. Because my grandmother took my 
mother's bebito. My little sister had a bebito.

13:14.203 --> 13:16.686
She was a month or two months old. And there they 
spent three days and four nights on top of the

13:17.493 --> 13:21.497
sticks. My mother here in the farm and other women, 
all the families of the other women, crying

13:22.878 --> 13:33.748
because they didn't know if they had drowned or 
not. My mother said that they passed the trees, the

13:33.848 --> 13:39.013
rivers gathered, all the rivers. The river, I 
don't know what that river is called, that is in

13:40.294 --> 13:45.339
Padilla. I don't know its name, it has a name. And 
there's a river that my mom says is very big, and

13:47.429 --> 13:52.174
that river grows all the time with a lot of water. 
It's called the Corona River. They got together

13:53.735 --> 13:58.319
and all the water came. It was when they say that...

13:58.420 --> 14:06.087
That water came from Tocante, they say that a hill 
was blown up. I don't know what it is in Monterrey,

14:06.107 --> 14:12.413
that has a lot of water. And it blew up. That was the 
flood that happened. I said, mom, there were a lot

14:15.104 --> 14:21.233
of people who had no houses. And they had adobe 
houses, you know, adobe houses, you know, the ones

14:21.253 --> 14:24.979
they had. And the water would get to the shore like 
this, because the river was very close. They said

14:29.226 --> 14:34.093
that the waves of water would come and they would do 
like this. And it got all wet, but they said, mom, we

14:34.113 --> 14:39.762
didn't think it would get wet at all. The only thing 
that made us strong was your father and my little

14:40.180 --> 14:48.331
creature and your mother and all the people. There 
were 30 families and all of them were in the mosques

14:48.371 --> 14:55.200
up there. Yes. When it started to go down, I saw the 
mosques and the trees. I saw that the mosques, the

14:58.184 --> 15:03.331
trees, only the tips of the branches were removed. 
Yes. It was a very ugly, very ugly, very big, very

15:04.379 --> 15:09.024
big, at that time, my mother. And that's when it 
started, when they saw that they started to go down

15:09.084 --> 15:13.209
a little bit. And then, between more and more, 
another day, it got lower and lower, so that man

15:13.229 --> 15:21.779
went down, because he was very good at swimming. 
And he said, let's see if I can reach Plan. We

15:26.724 --> 15:27.585
reached Plan. We looked for a way to cross the 
river, to see if we could cross over to Papadilla.

15:33.804 --> 15:38.830
They go, and he went down and reached a little bit of 
Plano. And we reached Plano, and it was him, and

15:38.991 --> 15:45.258
another man, and a brother of my mother's. And my 
grandmother didn't want him to leave because she

15:45.278 --> 15:48.942
thought he was going to drown. And he said, you're 
going to drown, Maximiano. No, no, Grandma, no,

15:52.947 --> 15:56.231
no, my son. May God help us. And they left. And they 
went to swim there. My mom said that they arrived

16:00.886 --> 16:05.831
like at 3 in the afternoon, in the middle of the 
water. But they arrived to see how the people were

16:05.851 --> 16:10.336
doing and to give them reason. And they said that 
they were all crying, all the women were crying.

16:14.059 --> 16:19.505
Some for their children, some for their husbands, 
some for their sisters, for their daughters. And

16:20.646 --> 16:23.149
then they arrived and said, well, where did they 
come from? Where did they come from? Where did they

16:24.290 --> 16:25.551
come from? We have them there, don't take care of 
them, they're good. But we came to bring them food,

16:30.216 --> 16:34.381
because there are those innocent people without 
food. And now the children are small. But when they

16:37.404 --> 16:44.813
went out there to Padilla, where the $100 store 
was, he said that he already gave them the water

16:37.404 --> 16:44.813
here, and that was going down there. And then they 
left, they went to talk to the administrator, and

16:45.974 --> 16:53.783
he sent a lot of people, the administrator, so that 
they could save those families. And there were

16:58.713 --> 17:10.890
many people, men, to such an extent that when they 
arrived and then from there they were going to

16:58.713 --> 17:10.890
bring them, to cross them one by one, to bring them. 
And on the shore that they knew was on the shore of

17:10.910 --> 17:19.423
the river, there they had some skiff to cross with 
the families. And that's how they crossed them.

17:24.442 --> 17:30.320
And my aunt didn't want to go down because she was 
afraid. She was the first baby she had. And when she

17:32.406 --> 17:34.873
went down, the baby fell into the water. my aunt's 
baby, and she screamed, my aunt was very angry, and

17:35.512 --> 17:45.966
my aunt went to grab the baby, but she didn't know 
how to swim, so she caught it. Then the other lady

17:45.986 --> 17:47.808
grabbed the baby and took it out. It didn't drown, 
but it did drown. And that was when my grandmother,

17:51.333 --> 17:57.861
my mother and my father got very scared and died. 
They died of pure heart attack. She saw a lot of

18:01.330 --> 18:03.172
water. She said she didn't see the trees. You 
couldn't see the low trees. Only the tall ones. And

18:12.084 --> 18:16.049
they spent three days and four nights in that. She 
said they had the pieces in the water. But the

18:18.872 --> 18:23.698
sticks that the gentlemen put were very solid. 
They tied them very solid. It was as if they were up

18:26.582 --> 18:28.384
there. And so many days. My mother would tell us, 
and I don't even want to remember, but normally I

18:33.284 --> 18:40.854
tell them to know how we suffered. How we suffered. 
Your father suffered with his mother in Tantahui,

18:42.357 --> 18:48.485
with your aunt, and your other aunt. Two sisters of 
my father were there. My father and my

18:50.428 --> 18:57.017
grandmother.

18:57.037 --> 18:58.219
And my mother here alone. and my grandmother, my 
mother's mother, they were here in Hacienda

18:59.178 --> 19:02.943
Dolores. I mean, just waiting for them to tell them 
that they had drowned, because they couldn't,

19:03.643 --> 19:14.416
because many drowned, my mother, many people 
drowned. Because they took the whole houses, they

19:14.436 --> 19:21.705
took the houses, they went through the middle of 
the river, going around the houses. Many people

19:21.745 --> 19:25.630
went inside, they drowned. That's why they were 
afraid, and they were afraid of, They were afraid

19:29.198 --> 19:33.505
of them here, and they were afraid of them there. 
They didn't know where they were or how they were.

19:35.488 --> 19:40.777
They didn't know if they would have been taken by 
the water. My mom said it was very heavy. They said

19:42.280 --> 19:46.687
it was a cyclone, but it didn't rain much. It 
started to rain and it stopped, but the water kept

19:46.707 --> 19:53.839
coming up and up and up until it covered some 
houses. It didn't go up there because it was too

19:54.275 --> 19:57.960
high in the hacienda. They said it was too high. It 
was too high. In the hacienda too? In the hacienda

20:01.405 --> 20:02.487
Dolores. They said it only went up to a certain 
part. And it went up. And very little, to some

20:06.132 --> 20:12.942
houses it went up, because it was too low. I don't 
even want to remember, but I'll tell you so you know

20:13.563 --> 20:18.208
how we suffered. We suffered because your father 
left and took your little sister, your

20:18.228 --> 20:43.553
grandmother, because she took good care of her, 
and your grandmother, and your other aunt, and

20:18.228 --> 20:43.553
your other aunt, and a brother of mine, and the rest 
were well-known families, families from the

20:18.228 --> 20:43.553
ranch that were there, they all got together. But 
my mom said, well, how could your grandmother not

20:44.225 --> 20:50.853
be dead? She said that after two months of that, my 
grandmother died. Because she was very surprised

20:58.703 --> 21:06.012
to be so alone and to see so much water. And she 
thought that just as they were there, there would

21:06.032 --> 21:11.319
be those who were there. And my grandmother died. 
The mother of

21:12.997 --> 21:18.045
my father. My father was a very good man. This 
cyclone here in Corpus Christi in 19...1919? Oh,

21:26.037 --> 21:26.398
19. Do you remember this? No, I don't remember. I 
was more in the middle. How old was that little

21:34.190 --> 21:36.874
girl? I think I had like... Nine years, more or 
less. About eight years. Eight years, yes. But I

21:47.551 --> 22:00.187
don't see much, because I was with an aunt of mine, 
and we spent time in a house, but she was at a table,

21:47.551 --> 22:00.187
like, oh, there's a girl, and there we were, me and 
another little sister of mine. So we didn't see

22:00.267 --> 22:02.911
much. I know Celia, who came now. Yes, yes. I didn't 
see her. No? The other one that came, the first one,

22:08.853 --> 22:15.320
what's her name? Celia. Celia, but she came... 
Yes, but another one came. The first one. What's

22:21.206 --> 22:24.109
the other one called? She also has a name of a woman. 
The first one, and then came Celia. Celia was the

22:29.734 --> 22:33.919
one who... Well, I didn't see her. No? No, because I 
worked with Mrs. Kepp, Miss Kepp. So she was in a

22:39.127 --> 22:45.794
small closet, and we went up there because her 
house was very elegant. Her house was very

22:45.834 --> 22:50.199
elegant,

22:45.834 --> 22:50.199
very tall. Like this one, it had a floor down and a 
floor up. And they started to fall, like those

22:52.862 --> 22:58.648
windows, all down. All of them. And the water 
inside was so high. She started to come in and she

23:04.793 --> 23:14.914
grabbed me and two other boys that she had and the 
little boy. We got into a closet and she said, no,

23:14.934 --> 23:21.447
don't go because I don't know what's going to 
happen. She said, if you want to go home, don't kill

23:21.467 --> 23:24.033
us. Don't kill the girls. So we were there, in the 
closet, locked up. So I didn't forget how I was.

23:32.385 --> 23:49.768
After it was all over, we went out to see, and on the 
streets I saw pure things like this, electric

23:32.385 --> 23:49.768
coffee machines, bread toasters, well, full of 
pure trash on the streets, from where the houses

23:32.385 --> 23:49.768
were. Very terrible. And I don't

23:52.518 --> 24:01.952
forget.

24:02.607 --> 24:11.903
And the other day they said that a tornado was 
coming and I said, playing with my sister, ah,

24:02.607 --> 24:11.903
well, let Pabelo come. I've never seen a chubasco 
like that. And Jonevitas, as I remember, said,

24:15.789 --> 24:21.839
well, yes, well, he left a lot of everything, a lot 
of bodies, it was pure board, wherever, in the

24:15.789 --> 24:21.839
streets. Do you have fear of other things? Oh, yes. 
Yes, a lot? Well, yes, because that's how Corpus

24:26.519 --> 24:33.479
Christi was, very cheap. There are many houses 
that have just been built, and it's been three

24:33.499 --> 24:41.862
years since I've been here. My brother lives here 
on this side. His house, his blankets, his

24:47.281 --> 24:55.470
clothes, all the clothes that they put on were well 
made because they had ironed them. The mattresses

24:55.490 --> 25:01.436
and the curtains didn't fit at all. The doors 
didn't fit at all. The windows, just the doors. My

25:04.379 --> 25:08.743
brother didn't fit at all. He was very scared. They 
said he was screaming a lot. He was screaming a lot.

25:14.327 --> 25:18.111
He grabbed the smallest one and he squeezed her. 
And he has one. And the girl got married. She just

25:21.935 --> 25:26.720
started to see the water and the doors opened and 
she fainted. Because he was very scared. She

25:28.862 --> 25:32.646
fainted and she was fine. Super. And Pancho was 
already struggling with her and Manuel with the

25:34.749 --> 25:38.933
two little ones here, grabbing them. and a little 
girl and a daughter who were there with him. I also

25:43.217 --> 25:45.140
had three of them. And then I couldn't attend to the 
doors, and I said, Manuel, let the doors be taken

25:45.160 --> 25:52.289
away, just don't let a creature get in. I take care 
of my children. God help us, all the clothes go

25:55.513 --> 25:57.696
away. Yes, the pieces of sheets and mattresses 
were on the side of the street. God didn't leave

26:04.064 --> 26:05.005
them anything. I said, well, thank God that he 
brought the clothes, but they didn't do anything,

26:05.896 --> 26:14.068
I don't see any of his family. No one turned around. 
Is it possible to make preparations before the

26:16.712 --> 26:22.240
next cyclone? Is there anything for people to do? I 
don't know what they can do. They have given many

26:27.548 --> 26:31.414
instructions on the radio to say how to do it. What 
can they do? They were saying that when a tornado

26:35.337 --> 26:59.730
comes, if they think that their house is not very 
powerful to resist that air, that they go out into

26:35.337 --> 26:59.730
the street where there are no trees, and if they see 
a very strong storm of air, because that's what

26:35.337 --> 26:59.730
comes most in those tornadoes, air than water, 
right? that they fall on the ground and get really

26:59.828 --> 27:03.133
strong. On the ground, better. Because in the 
house, a stick falls. That's how people get

27:09.523 --> 27:13.390
killed. A stick or something falls and hits them. A 
window frame. That's what the man says when he

27:20.361 --> 27:26.190
gives the advice for hurricanes, for... For 
tornadoes. But tornadoes are ugly because they go

27:27.922 --> 27:31.241
around like this. It's a... It's a whirlwind, 
right? Yes. A whirlwind of air. A whirlwind. Yes,

27:37.243 --> 27:38.765
it's a whirlwind. There are hurricanes and... The 
hurricane is a hurricane air, but it also brings a

27:40.949 --> 27:46.817
lot of water. Yes. And these tornadoes do bring 
water, but not a lot. What they bring is a lot of air,

27:50.102 --> 27:52.706
like this, back and forth. Yes. And after it 
passes, there's water. Yes. That's what happens.

27:57.713 --> 28:01.719
It seems that a tornado is worse than a chubaco. A 
chubaco? Chubasco. What is this? Chubasco is a

28:04.997 --> 28:11.887
very strong water with a lot of air that sweeps the 
trees like this. Do you see how the cell fell? Yes,

28:14.431 --> 28:16.955
it's the same thing as a hurricane. Chubasco and 
hurricane are the same thing. It's just that the

28:18.878 --> 28:22.863
hurricane is stronger because the air comes much 
stronger. The hurricane. And the chubasco comes

28:24.125 --> 28:27.670
strong, but the air comes with water. So it's 
not... It's not that strong because in parts when

28:30.127 --> 28:36.894
the water falls, it cuts the air a little, you know? 
It cuts the air a little. And the hurricane, no, it

28:39.336 --> 28:45.162
comes sweeping everything because the water 
comes as strong as the air. It's almost the same as

28:45.182 --> 28:49.367
the tornado, the hurricane. The hurricane is 
strong. And yesterday they were saying, talking,

28:52.390 --> 28:55.493
reporting that It's a tropical storm. Tropical is 
very strong water and air, like a hurricane, the

29:04.035 --> 29:13.407
tropical one. Well, now they give names to people. 
A friend of mine, She has a sister named Celia. I

29:22.260 --> 29:24.724
said to Celia, I don't love you. I said to Dred, 
playing, I don't love you. She said, why? Because

29:26.686 --> 29:27.948
your name is Celia. And Celia was very terrible 
here with us. How could she leave us? She left a lot

29:32.575 --> 29:40.265
of people without... My kids, where I worked, they 
had here, to Sandia, to one side of El Naranjo. They

29:41.768 --> 29:45.553
have a ranch, not very big, about 40 acres. And they 
had a very nice trailer. Y le estaban pegando

29:48.967 --> 29:53.934
corredor de pura tela para cuando iban a pasar día 
de campo. Estaba muy fresco y no se metían los

29:53.954 --> 29:56.217
zancudos ni nada. Pues no las dejó nada. Se las 
barrió, las trae, las contó y todo. Hace una semana

30:04.729 --> 30:14.022
que le había ido a poner cortinas nuevas y todo para 
ahora que venga el summer para ir a pasar una semana

30:04.729 --> 30:14.022
allá o dos. Le dijo, y te vamos a llevar a ti también, 
dijo, para que te vayas con nosotros a pasear allá.

30:18.447 --> 30:23.714
Well, Celia came and she didn't leave anything for 
them. The pots, the pans, the pans, they were found

30:23.754 --> 30:27.459
in the labors buried in the ground. And she didn't 
leave anything for them. A house that they had,

30:31.424 --> 30:35.889
they lost a lot, those gentlemen. Their house was 
almost all sold out. And only the room where I

30:40.636 --> 30:44.100
slept, where the child slept, He didn't break a 
window, he didn't get wet, he didn't do anything.

30:51.992 --> 30:56.402
But where the girls slept, where the lady slept, 
there was nothing left. He had a big mirror, like

30:56.422 --> 30:59.028
this one. He had the sign to wash himself. Like 
this, the big mirror. There was nothing left. Las

31:05.444 --> 31:15.539
cortinas, las ventanas, nomás los cuadros sin 
vidrio, las ventanas, las cortinas, todas las

31:05.444 --> 31:15.539
sacó, las bolas y las aventó para afuera. Todo. Y la 
que tenían en por el antes para ir a pasar días de

31:19.224 --> 31:29.199
campo, cuando iban a pescar, la señora dice que 
nomás un montón de madera. Ellos perdieron mucho.

31:31.837 --> 31:37.605
He became very bad, despite the fact that he lost a 
lot of money. He's a doctor, however he wants to

31:38.246 --> 31:42.071
call it. He already has all his land, and he loses 
money, however he wants to call it. That's the

31:47.960 --> 31:50.403
money he spends, right? To buy that. I used to cry a 
lot there, when I was in my room. Don't cry, your

31:53.548 --> 31:55.971
people are good at saying yes. But I don't know how 
they are doing. And I don't know my house. He said my

32:03.328 --> 32:04.570
house didn't fall. Nothing fell. He took a window. 
He broke a glass window and took a cloth. The doors,

32:14.713 --> 32:22.264
at the time, like three months or four months after 
it had happened, they started to break down due to

32:14.713 --> 32:22.264
the humidity of the water. They started to fall, 
the doors, but it was all. I saw how it was, and the

32:25.108 --> 32:34.421
roof from above, from outside, it also started to 
fall, the one that was supposed to be on the roof.

32:36.404 --> 32:38.547
But for it to fall, no. or that my bed or my things 
would get wet. They didn't get wet. And a lady, a

32:42.941 --> 32:53.717
young lady, who wanted a house that was almost the 
same and with the same accompaniment, they didn't

32:42.941 --> 32:53.717
have anything left. They only had a chair, like 
this one here, a chair like this one that was

32:53.737 --> 32:58.925
standing. That was all that was left. In my house. 
And all the people say, why was she so lucky? She

33:08.942 --> 33:12.828
didn't even get her house wet. And the man says, 
Chihuahua, look what a lucky girl. We have a lot of

33:15.632 --> 33:18.577
boards. And mine doesn't. But maybe mine has a lot 
of trees. They say that's why. That the trees

33:27.250 --> 33:31.416
helped her a lot. how to stop the air, because there 
is a tree on this side, there are some oranges on

33:32.442 --> 33:56.644
this side, and on this side, I had, since I moved in, 
those little trees were born, when my father and

33:32.442 --> 33:56.644
mother lived, they were like this, little ones, 
they were born, and they were made like this, They

33:57.063 --> 33:58.344
were very curious. They grew together, very 
tangled. And when Celia took them out, she took one

34:01.148 --> 34:11.679
with all the roots and the other one was left there. 
But it was all the damage she did. The tree fell on

34:14.342 --> 34:24.994
the edge of the roof of the house and took a big piece 
of that board that was thrown at the house by the

34:14.342 --> 34:24.994
edge. It was all the damage that he did to my house. 
The window that fell, the fabric, the glass that

34:28.480 --> 34:38.554
broke, and the tree that he took out, he took it out 
with three roots. And he took it out. But he was very

34:39.535 --> 34:42.740
curious, he looked at me like that, and I told him 
how I was. Because they were born together. And

34:46.205 --> 34:49.369
they were made like that. That's how he was. Let me

34:51.029 --> 35:13.138
say it.

35:21.877 --> 35:26.894
I was talking and cutting this because I have to cut 
it. I'm going to make enchiladas. You already ate.

35:30.124 --> 35:30.285
What? You already ate.
