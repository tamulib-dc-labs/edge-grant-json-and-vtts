00:01.364 --> 00:09.533
Captain Wheeler, who weighed 300 pounds, he's the 
only guy I knew in the Army who had two pistol belts

00:01.364 --> 00:09.533
around him. How'd they let him stay in? They waved 
him. In the guard you could do that. He and I were

00:14.959 --> 00:18.983
freshmen at A&M, four years there. After we worked 
all day in the field, we'd go to the officer club and

00:19.163 --> 00:25.530
have a few beers and we would have a ball. We had a 
storm one night, one weekend. And it was a tornado.

00:31.678 --> 00:36.445
And we were out there holding ropes and holding 
tents. And mess halls were flying all over the

00:36.485 --> 00:38.529
place. And damn, Wheeler would, Sam, call me on the 
phone. The phones were still intact for some

00:42.274 --> 00:43.897
reason. The field phone said, hey, you got any 
privates you can send over to help hold the tent

00:43.917 --> 00:48.344
down? I said, hell no. I'm holding the tent down 
myself. So after that weekend, Monday night, we

00:53.862 --> 00:56.926
worked all day getting everything straight. 
Monday, we worked all day getting everything

00:57.146 --> 00:58.768
straight. And then Monday night, we were all tired 
and battered and beat. And we went to the officer's

01:02.452 --> 01:05.236
club and had a few beers. And next thing I knew, Sam 
Wheeler and I, Captain Wheeler and I, were in the

01:05.336 --> 01:13.966
middle of the officer's club dance floor 
imitating the generals. Yeah. And who walks in?

01:17.591 --> 01:18.051
The generals. That never fails. And of course, 
everybody in the, We knew everybody. We knew

01:24.095 --> 01:25.296
everybody in the division.

01:29.541 --> 01:35.508
And they walked in and we put on an act about the big 
win. And we had apple crates on the floor like we

01:35.528 --> 01:40.635
were in the general's chair. And we said, ah, well, 
what's the troops doing down in the field? General

01:48.031 --> 01:51.495
Wheeler, Captain Wheeler said, well, the damn 
missile's blowing away. Let them blow away. We can

01:52.255 --> 01:53.337
get some, you know. We made fun of them, see. And we 
got through. The damn officer club just roared.

02:00.544 --> 02:01.725
Just laughed like hell. And it all at once got 
quiet. We looked around. There was General

02:05.189 --> 02:10.735
Ainsworth and General Ives and General Simpson. 
We didn't know what to do. General Miller walked

02:13.477 --> 02:15.560
up, boy, and he clapped. And he says, do it again for 
me. So every time we'd go to summer camp with their

02:17.782 --> 02:23.928
guard, we had to put on that Big Win Act. So, you 
know, we had a sense of humor.

02:32.117 --> 02:34.399
I don't know where else we covered. All the 
schools. Oh yeah, I went to... You went to

02:37.162 --> 02:40.746
Communist Strategy School. And I wanted to talk, I 
forgot to ask you about that. Tell me about this

02:44.169 --> 02:46.212
Communist Strategy School. This is a About what, 
1961 was it? Yeah, that's right. 62, 61. Went to

02:51.207 --> 02:52.008
Washington. Went to the State Department. State 
Department. They had openings. They had some

02:56.614 --> 03:02.561
quotas for reserve officers. I went. And it dealt 
with the communist countries. And at that time,

03:10.170 --> 03:15.497
they knew the communists were trying to dominate 
the world. And they wanted to make the military

03:16.102 --> 03:18.766
aware of it. That's the purpose of it. It spent two 
weeks there. Very, very interesting. And what did

03:24.615 --> 03:25.476
they talk about? Did they talk about theory or 
Marxist theory? Marxism. Marxism. Did they have

03:31.485 --> 03:33.227
people come in and talk to you? Or did the State 
Department itself? The State Department people

03:34.549 --> 03:36.653
came in and talked to us. And they took each country 
in South America and told us... gave us a

03:45.515 --> 03:51.141
background on how the Marxists was in there and how 
the communists was in there. And then they got into

03:51.161 --> 03:55.886
European countries and they took each country. 
And then they really didn't ever come up with a plan

03:56.547 --> 04:02.093
what they were doing to counteract it. Did they 
know? They really didn't know how to handle it. And

04:08.259 --> 04:09.761
it was very interesting. What was your opinion of 
the State Department personnel? Wasn't top

04:15.417 --> 04:16.438
notch. It wasn't? No, it really wasn't.

04:24.228 --> 04:28.133
They acted like they were in another government or 
something. Really. They held themselves aloof

04:28.934 --> 04:32.899
from us. Just the outset, they were aloof. I was 
very disappointed in them. And then a book came

04:41.289 --> 04:42.410
out. What was it? Decisions on the fifth floor. 
That's where the State Department decision made

04:46.242 --> 04:50.507
on the fifth floor of the state. Yeah, and so I read 
excerpts of that and I can understand. In fact, the

04:56.814 --> 05:04.122
guy that conducted the seminar talked with a 
British clip. Yeah. So I didn't feel like he was

05:06.925 --> 05:09.848
part of my government. But yet he was... Foreign 
service officer, career foreign service

05:13.113 --> 05:15.376
officer. Maybe he was educated in England. Maybe, 
you know. Or maybe he had a lot of, maybe he had just

05:20.804 --> 05:25.771
got back from years of service in England or 
something like that. And picked up some of that.

05:26.953 --> 05:31.099
Picked up and really had a strong, but I never felt 
like they were part of us. I really didn't. I stood

05:32.661 --> 05:33.402
aloof. I also went to the, I went to the nuclear... a 
radiological nuclear damage course at Treasure

05:40.315 --> 05:47.204
Island when I was a captain. I don't know why I went 
to that damn thing. I was in the Guard. I guess they

05:49.887 --> 05:58.959
had a quarter and wanted to send somebody, and I 
went there, and we went on these ships that they had

05:49.887 --> 05:58.959
at Utah. I don't know, out in the Pacific where they

05:59.259 --> 06:10.153
were testing the nuclear bomb, the atom bombs. And 
they had all these ships in there, and we had to get

06:10.538 --> 06:12.600
on them. What year was this? This is in 48. It's not 
even on there. No. So this is in 48? Yeah. During the

06:21.371 --> 06:22.532
atomic test? Yeah. What's that island? Those 
Antole Islands? I went in there. For some reason or

06:31.562 --> 06:34.666
another, I took a nuclear corresponding course. I 
thought it was interesting. Well, they call it the

06:37.910 --> 06:39.111
atomic test. the course and I thought it was 
interesting and I took it and had a lot of math in it

06:40.660 --> 06:47.130
and I didn't like that. And then there was a Navy 
commander out here in the reserve and he was taking

06:47.150 --> 06:53.540
the same course and so we studied together. And 
then I got a letter saying that I was eligible to go

06:55.903 --> 07:03.855
to this nuclear defense course out at Treasure 
Island. Would I be interested in going as an Army

07:03.875 --> 07:07.401
representative? I said yeah. Two weeks on 
Treasure Island. It was good duty. But you didn't

07:12.628 --> 07:15.331
witness an atomic blast yourself? No, no. All we 
did was went through the cyclotron out at Beverly,

07:16.432 --> 07:27.202
not Beverly,

07:16.432 --> 07:27.202
Berkeley. We went through everything, and that 
was new, you know. So I did some pretty good school.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.431
I went to some good schools. Good schools. I went to 
the, not Sean either, doing World War II when it was

07:38.311 --> 07:55.616
in England and the division artillery was levied 
upon to send somebody to the mine damage school of

07:38.311 --> 07:55.616
Great Britain. And that, the purpose of that was 
how to deactivate mines. And Terry, they were

08:04.715 --> 08:08.039
There were two people killed in the school in 
several mains. So you know how I felt. All we had was

08:10.643 --> 08:16.070
a bayonet and we probed the ground for the mines. 
And then we also set the, we had to make up patterns

08:17.091 --> 08:20.976
for mines. And we also had to detect the patterns. 
And when we got in combat, we were supposed to, if

08:24.741 --> 08:33.372
we're going across minefield, I was to be called up 
as the expert and say, now the minefield is set this

08:24.741 --> 08:33.372
way, this, This is the way we deactivate. See? 
Yeah. Thank God I never had to do that. Did you ever

08:40.658 --> 08:43.321
go to that school? Oh, yeah, I went to the school. 
But you were never called on to go? Oh, I went

08:46.685 --> 08:48.207
through the minefields. I don't know how I never 
got my arm blown off. I was very cautious. Oh, I was

08:53.433 --> 08:54.314
cautious. Oh, yeah, I went to the school. Oh, sure. 
But you were never called upon to go and deactivate

08:57.677 --> 09:00.861
a minefield? At school? In combat? No. I was too 
busy forward observing. Yeah, I was too busy

09:08.488 --> 09:11.833
directing artillery fire. What did you think of 
the schools in general? They were good. Very good.

09:17.562 --> 09:19.946
The Army schools are excellent schools. 
Excellent. What do you think the best one was? War

09:23.972 --> 09:24.493
College? War College. Oh yeah, that's the top 
school. Oh yeah. I also went to the

09:30.828 --> 09:32.891
counterinsurgency school at Fort Bragg. 
Catherine went with me this time. Yeah, it was a

09:34.633 --> 09:37.337
counterinsurgency. That was the special

09:37.357 --> 09:42.925
forces school. When was this, early in the 60s?

09:48.533 --> 09:49.194
I was a colonel. No, I was a lieutenant colonel. So 
it must have been late 50s,

09:53.400 --> 09:59.569
early 60s. And General Stilwell was a commandant. 
And we, it was a seminar type thing. We studied

10:09.467 --> 10:27.430
insurgency activities and how to, and also how, if 
you drop behind the lines, how to organize the

10:09.467 --> 10:27.430
indigent people and how to resist 
counter-revolution and stuff. just what's going

10:28.321 --> 10:30.545
on in El Salvador. I hope they don't call me back for 
that. No. So I went to some good schools. I really

10:38.257 --> 10:38.898
did. So I think this helped me along the way to 
become a general officer. And I felt kind of

10:46.790 --> 10:50.496
rounded out in education. To where I could hold my 
own with anybody. I don't care who you are.

10:59.202 --> 11:12.915
But I look back now, A&M

10:59.202 --> 11:12.915
taught me, I repeat it many times, 
self-discipline. It's extraordinarily

11:12.935 --> 11:14.657
important. It is. And law and order. You've got to 
be the law. Papa taught me that. Papa taught me to

11:22.645 --> 11:29.091
love America and obey the laws. So

11:30.320 --> 11:40.455
it gave me respect for authority, respect for 
responsibility, people. And I was very fortunate

11:40.475 --> 11:45.743
to have a daddy like that. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So all

11:49.107 --> 11:57.019
of us brothers. I'm deeply grateful to A&M.

12:03.632 --> 12:04.313
Great school. And I don't see anything wrong in the 
way it's going now. Now, you know, I had mentioned

12:11.882 --> 12:27.141
to you earlier about the Corps and maybe

12:11.882 --> 12:27.141
those ones that don't want to get in the Corps could 
go through the ROTC program. on second thought, it

12:27.374 --> 12:29.856
wouldn't be right for the Corps. It would kill the 
Corps. It would hurt them. Yeah, so I'm going to

12:32.799 --> 12:35.141
withdraw that statement. Okay, well we didn't get 
it on tape anyway. Didn't we? I don't know if we did

12:38.064 --> 12:38.805
or not. No, we were talking about it in the kitchen. 
Yeah, I guess we were. And if we did, then... Well,

12:42.668 --> 12:46.412
we can cross it out, yeah.

12:49.535 --> 12:49.995
What else? I'm done. I mean, I have exhausted my 
questions, but is there anything else that you

12:51.376 --> 12:56.301
think that's part of my... Well, it's that old 
training now. Do you feel like we've gone in the

13:03.717 --> 13:08.143
right direction in your... In the interview? 
Yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely. This ends our

13:13.230 --> 13:14.713
interview then. Thanks a lot, General. I really 
appreciate it. Well, I thank you, Terry. You've

13:18.097 --> 13:19.960
been very nice and kind.
