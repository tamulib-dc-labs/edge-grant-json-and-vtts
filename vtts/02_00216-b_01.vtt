WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:09.649
We had a large number of vets, but they were all in 
individual companies. We had the Army, the Air

00:10.370 --> 00:26.906
Force, and we did not have a Marine Corps unit, but 
we had Army and Air Force both, and I don't think we

00:10.370 --> 00:26.906
even had Navy units at that time. But I was on the 
battalion staff and then became battalion

00:30.878 --> 00:45.565
commander in my senior

00:30.878 --> 00:45.565
year.

00:46.928 --> 00:50.054
It was one of the battalions in the wing. All right. 
Compared to all the other ordinary Corps outfits.

00:57.018 --> 01:02.526
What was different about the way y'all got fish and 
sophomores and all? We didn't have, we didn't have

01:03.527 --> 01:08.674
any great deal of distinction. Once you got off the 
brave ground, went back to the dorms, you were all

01:08.915 --> 01:13.260
just the same. So y'all didn't have any paddles? 
No. And no, no freshmen came to take care of your

01:17.226 --> 01:20.170
room? No. No, you were back, Because that was, you 
know, that was sort of what we didn't want. And you

01:27.884 --> 01:31.447
were older than average, that outfit was. Yeah. 
Now, where were you quartered then? Over in the

01:34.470 --> 01:39.055
regular Corps area, what you call the quad now, I 
think. Did you all march into the dining hall?

01:41.697 --> 01:43.599
Marched in, we did everything the Corps did. And we 
were just another unit in the Corps at that time,

01:44.540 --> 01:49.705
and had our own flags, our own companies, the 
battalions and the wing and it wasn't that very

01:50.360 --> 01:57.693
well. I mean, it was we it was like you're living two 
lives. You got on the dress and formed a company you

02:03.182 --> 02:07.289
were military. When you got back, you were just 
there's no distinction of what you had on the

02:08.411 --> 02:14.642
shoulder didn't make didn't make any difference. 
You're all the same. For you veterans, were there

02:16.043 --> 02:38.905
ever any

02:16.043 --> 02:38.905
special events, I'm trying to search for words 
here, where you as a former enlisted man and a

02:16.043 --> 02:38.905
former officer, did that ever matter after the war 
here on the campus? No. I had, in fact, one of the

02:40.887 --> 02:45.932
other fellows, and I should have mentioned while I 
was doing this, was a marine lieutenant with me in

02:46.773 --> 02:56.069
China and all the time I was there. He was my next 
officer, first officer. He was a lieutenant. I

03:03.521 --> 03:05.284
guess he finally made first lieutenant. His name 
was Howard Whitney and I came back to A&M after I got

03:05.785 --> 03:11.194
out when I came back to work here over visiting the 
department and there was Howard Whitney there and

03:12.001 --> 03:38.768
I'd served you know nearly a year with him in China 
but he was another very good

03:12.001 --> 03:38.768
member of the department and very useful and 
helpful and I think he went to he left here and went

03:12.001 --> 03:38.768
to I believe the University of Minnesota

03:39.727 --> 03:46.174
And this arrangement within the Corps for the 
special veterans' outfits worked well? As far as I

03:46.194 --> 03:47.855
could tell, it worked very well. I never heard of 
any problems we created. The commandant of the

03:53.521 --> 03:56.745
Corps at that time was General Boatner. Describe 
him and his leadership style.

04:05.614 --> 04:09.598
He was a tough cookie.

04:10.051 --> 04:38.691
The only chewing out I ever got from a from a general 
who who had good reason to do so I was a battalion

04:10.051 --> 04:38.691
exec at the time and we were in a drill out on the main 
drill field I don't know which one I'd forgotten

04:10.051 --> 04:38.691
which one it was but I always had a chewing gum had a 
heavy chewing gum and I happened to have some in my

04:10.051 --> 04:38.691
mouth I knew better but uh When we walked by, he saw 
it and invited me into his office the next day. And

04:47.515 --> 04:59.633
along with, at that time, our battalion 
commander,

04:47.515 --> 04:59.633
whose name was Smith or Smythe, and he chewed both 
of us out. Chewed me out for chewing gum, and I'd

05:01.250 --> 05:03.933
known better. I'd been in the Marine Corps for 
nearly three years, and I knew you weren't

05:04.013 --> 05:08.878
supposed to do that. I knew you weren't supposed to 
do that, according to him, and I did. And then he got

05:13.562 --> 05:23.292
ahold of Smythe because he was my superior 
officer, and let him have it for a while. Now, I've

05:24.253 --> 05:28.017
not heard anybody describe Boatner physically. 
As I recall, he was not an imposing figure. He was

05:33.160 --> 05:39.089
average height, or maybe not quite average 
height. He was a little heavier than, wasn't quite

05:40.330 --> 05:45.699
as trim as some would like to be. But he had a 
definite military bearing, and in a lot of ways,

05:48.022 --> 05:55.894
the demeanor No, it wasn't. I was gonna say he was 
like Earl Rudder, but he wasn't like Earl Rudder in

05:57.596 --> 06:08.430
his relationships to people, but he was, there was 
no question who was in the boss. Now, when he was,

06:08.950 --> 06:15.599
uh, chewing you out, was he loud? Yeah, he was 
pretty loud. He'd get loud? Okay. He'd, uh, he got

06:19.183 --> 06:21.866
quite impressive. Strong language? bad 
language, but he, I think he was fully capable of

06:24.140 --> 06:32.088
doing that. All right, would, if something 
happened during, out on the drill field or

06:32.108 --> 06:40.135
anything, did he ever yell at people? Not that I 
recall. He may have yelled at some of his officers.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.382
But it was clear, clear who was in charge? Yeah, it 
was. He was, I think he went to put down that revolt

06:48.803 --> 06:53.708
in And everybody I've talked to said they were not 
surprised. No. All

06:58.657 --> 07:02.745
right. Did you have a car? When did you get a car? I 
got a car about four months after I got married in

07:06.572 --> 07:10.860
1950. Oh, okay. None of the times I've been here. I 
never could afford a car. Uh, the, uh, so you

07:15.035 --> 07:19.983
weren't involved in, in much of anything off 
campus. No. Uh, and, uh, did you, did you and your

07:21.726 --> 07:31.100
friends attend any religious services while you 
were students? Occasionally, not, not, uh,

07:31.120 --> 07:42.358
diligently, not, not every Sunday you went to 
church, but, uh, on occasion we would go to church.

07:42.507 --> 08:09.493
was he went to different ones okay and they were all 
at the north gate or south side yeah they're all in

07:42.507 --> 08:09.493
both these areas did you by by chance know mr cashin 
i did not know him well i had seen him but i didn't

07:42.507 --> 08:09.493
really know him i knew who he was and knew what he was 
doing you know when here now jim would have been

07:42.507 --> 08:09.493
just about a classmate of yours he would have been i 
think he was a year ahead of me okay uh Now, Red and I

08:10.250 --> 08:13.495
officiated football together for many, many 
years. But you didn't know him? I didn't know him

08:15.578 --> 08:16.379
then. Jim, of course, was playing football. And 
Red, I think, started then to play football, but

08:22.669 --> 08:31.863
never did go very far with it. Let's see, here's an 
almost superfluous. Did you and your buddies know

08:34.688 --> 08:36.611
about steam tunnels? No. I don't know where, in 
fact, I never did know really much about steam

08:39.241 --> 08:43.067
tunnels. I still don't. I know that they're here. 
Do you know, did you know, do you know anything you

08:48.015 --> 08:52.702
can share about secret fraternities?

08:55.386 --> 08:55.446
No. No, and that's not because I'd Wouldn't share 
it if I did, but I just don't know. I have heard that

09:02.378 --> 09:06.303
there were secret fraternities, but I don't know 
of any. There's one that apparently goes all the

09:07.806 --> 09:11.811
way back at least to Mr. Evans' time. Is that right? 
The swastikas, and their symbol was the novel, and

09:13.273 --> 09:22.827
they were using that a heck of a long time before 
Adolf Hitler was. And as far as I can learn, Now, I'm

09:26.997 --> 09:29.179
drawing the conclusion here, so it may be an error. 
They were the TTs, the true Texans. And I don't know

09:34.205 --> 09:47.038
whether they were anymore or not, but apparently 
the purpose of each of them, and the only purpose,

09:34.205 --> 09:47.038
was to get their members in the key core leadership 
positions, to have our guys in charge. That was it.

09:48.099 --> 09:56.768
Nothing ulterior, nothing... What were the 
major, for you and your acquaintances, what were

09:48.099 --> 09:56.768
the major... uh indulgences smoking and drinking 
and so forth of course you learned to smoke as soon

09:57.305 --> 10:25.810
as you got in the service if you didn't smoke before 
you got in you did eventually soon then but that was

09:57.305 --> 10:25.810
it uh smoking you're drinking beer smoking uh what 
kind of cigarettes well uh what was the favorite

09:57.305 --> 10:25.810
brands the the big brands that time were camels and 
lucky strike which had come back from the war by

09:57.305 --> 10:25.810
that time Cigars?

10:29.399 --> 10:30.921
Not many cigar smokers. Pipe smokers. I smoked a 
pipe for many, many years. And that was supposed to

10:34.825 --> 10:36.727
be intellectual, wasn't it? Oh, yeah. Well, I 
waited until I got intellectual before I started

10:37.447 --> 10:41.692
smoking a pipe. Were there any Aggies that rolled 
their own much? Quite a few. Well, most of us out in

10:46.577 --> 10:49.480
the... Again, this is country ball. You grew up. 
You smoked out there. You rolled your own. But once

10:53.484 --> 10:55.746
you got here... Did country boys continue to do 
that? Poor ones did. It costs much more to buy the

11:00.456 --> 11:02.939
ready rolls. Did Aggies chew tobacco or dip snuff? 
Not like they do now. I think there's more of it now.

11:11.870 --> 11:15.755
It sure seems to me to be than there was back when I 
was going to school. Then in alcohol, beer, what

11:15.855 --> 11:21.081
favorite varieties? You had Pearl and Southern 
Select and Grand Prize. Grand Prize. Is that the

11:26.493 --> 11:30.097
one out of Louisiana? There was one that came out of 
Louisiana? Falstaff. Falstaff, yeah. That was

11:34.361 --> 11:35.363
the other one. That was about it. Then they had 
slits. But Pearl was the one that I'd say at least

11:37.385 --> 11:43.532
the one I knew was the primary. If somebody drank a 
mixed drink, what was it likely to be? A salty dog

11:49.458 --> 11:54.083
was a... because it was something you could just 
sort of put the gin and a little ice. And if somebody

12:01.137 --> 12:06.363
poured something into a Coke bottle, what did they 
add? Probably a bourbon if you put it in a Coke

12:07.004 --> 12:08.886
bottle. It was probably a cheap bourbon that you 
could find. Did any of you even know, had you ever

12:13.472 --> 12:17.277
seen marijuana? You know, I still have never seen 
marijuana that I know of. Did you all even know the

12:22.143 --> 12:23.325
word? No. Didn't know there was such thing. And 
cocaine. Cocaine. Never heard of that. I'm not

12:29.952 --> 12:31.834
much younger than you, but a little. And the first 
time I ever heard of any of that was this two-bit

12:32.354 --> 12:44.445
movie of marijuana, and I can't remember what it 
was called, but supposedly if you smoked it, it

12:32.354 --> 12:44.445
made you completely insane. And that was it. And it 
was a dreary, dreary... I don't think I have

12:50.090 --> 12:53.213
ever... seen or been anywhere where marijuana was 
smoked during that time or really not since then.

13:01.993 --> 13:16.717
What I do remember is that when you'd have a penny 
ante poker game, everybody that could afford them

13:01.993 --> 13:16.717
got a twofer cigar, lit it up, and the smoke was so 
thick in there that you could hardly see the cards.

13:17.578 --> 13:20.483
Now, would Joel ever do that in a dorm room? You do it 
in the dorm. So smoking was allowed in the dorm.

13:28.395 --> 13:30.638
Whiskey Bridge was in high gear then. Did anybody 
ever get gypped at Whiskey Bridge? I've never

13:33.721 --> 13:35.904
heard of any mention of that. Not that I know of. It 
was always afforded. How common was it when you

13:40.309 --> 13:47.837
veterans were in the dormitory, how common was it 
for somebody to bring alcohol into the dorm? Very

13:48.323 --> 13:51.766
uncommon. We never did it. I never knew anybody 
that did it. As far as you know, were y'all

13:55.249 --> 14:03.557
inspected the same way the non-veteran corps 
members were in the dorm room? No. They didn't

14:04.218 --> 14:04.858
inspect? No. But y'all went out wearing the 
uniforms for the reviews and all that. We wore

14:11.845 --> 14:13.226
uniforms every day. Yeah, yeah. And was there 
anything on your uniform that indicated you were a

14:14.287 --> 14:17.470
veteran? No, unless you wore your ribbons. How 
common was that? Pretty common. In all parades, we

14:25.987 --> 14:30.073
were supposed to wear all of our ribbons. Were 
there some people, here's a serious question,

14:30.633 --> 14:41.128
were there some people in the Corps then that had 
earned some high decorations for bravery? Silver

14:42.340 --> 14:43.441
Star. Okay. Yeah, that's number three. No 
Distinguished Service Cross or Congressional

14:48.628 --> 14:51.552
Medal. No, not that I recall. All right, and he, had 
he already graduated? Okay.

15:02.907 --> 15:10.137
He had a lot of

15:02.907 --> 15:10.137
medals, well, Good

15:11.686 --> 15:22.700
conduct and then your theater ribbons. 
Congressional unit citations and that sort of

15:24.042 --> 15:29.028
thing. Did you Pacific veterans ever tease the 
European veterans that y'all had done more than

15:29.809 --> 15:36.698
they had? No, they were a bunch of candies up over 
there. They didn't have to slog through all those

15:42.050 --> 15:46.695
jungles and do that sort of thing. No, it was always 
a lot of talk back and forth about who really won the

15:46.715 --> 15:54.965
war and which one was the bad war to win. I had a 
serious question here. Compare the way the

15:59.209 --> 16:04.255
typical veteran who served in the Pacific felt 
then and has continued to feel about his former

16:05.348 --> 16:16.828
enemy compared to the way the European theater 
veteran felt and feels about his enemy. I think

16:18.511 --> 16:28.028
that those of us that fought the Japanese in the 
Pacific will never get over it. I don't think the

16:28.268 --> 16:29.871
same feeling really holds for the european group i 
mean maybe it's because they fought a whole bunch

16:30.982 --> 16:57.377
of different you know a whole bunch of different 
countries and not the same i don't know what it was

16:30.982 --> 16:57.377
but uh we uh we developed a very healthy dislike for 
the japanese uh i agree with your i have that

16:30.982 --> 16:57.377
summation i agree with do you do why uh

16:59.652 --> 17:23.065
I don't know, maybe it was because, really 
starting with Pearl Harbor, the fact that they got

16:59.652 --> 17:23.065
the reputation of being a sneaky bunch of stabbers 
in the back that came in out of nowhere and started

16:59.652 --> 17:23.065
the whole conflagration, and it was up to us then to 
go try to bring it back again. One day I was

17:23.926 --> 17:28.933
challenged by a young Japanese-American about 
how awful, awful, awful we were to drop that bomb,

17:30.027 --> 17:38.098
and I responded with this question. Do you think if 
the Japanese leadership of that era had had that

17:39.219 --> 17:47.791
bomb that they would have dropped it on us? The 
conversation ended then. Well, I thought then,

17:52.898 --> 17:58.465
and I still think now, that that was the best 
solution that could have come at that time. Saved

18:01.998 --> 18:02.699
lives. It saved not only ours, but theirs as well. 
If we had, if we really, and we were in the process,

18:06.466 --> 18:14.682
as I told you to begin with, loading up in Guam to go 
into Japan, And had we gone in, it was going to be a

18:15.235 --> 18:19.420
bloodbath on both sides. Well, I look what little I 
know about Iwo Jima and Okinawa. It seemed to me the

18:24.527 --> 18:32.837
closer the American troops got to the mainland of 
Japan, the harder the Japanese got. And the higher

18:32.857 --> 18:37.543
the losses, the more suicidal attacks and so 
forth. Did you all spend much time, you veterans,

18:38.184 --> 18:44.032
spend much time talking about the war in your 
student days? Did you all? Not a whole lot. You

18:46.414 --> 18:47.756
didn't replay much, did you? We didn't replay it 
much. We were just, I think most of us, just sort of

18:50.599 --> 18:54.424
glad it was over with and glad to get on. Did you 
sometimes tease each other about which branch of

18:55.826 --> 19:01.153
the service had really done the... Even in the 
Marine Corps, which boot camp did you go to? Oh. If

19:05.479 --> 19:08.783
you went to one of those candy... places of Paris 
Island that didn't amount to that. If you didn't go

19:11.765 --> 19:17.671
to San Diego and go through that, that's what we 
thought. But that was, you know, it's always just

19:17.691 --> 19:24.197
like schools, I'm sure. All right, give some 
examples of how did your Aggie pride and feelings,

19:24.217 --> 19:32.104
how did they get deeper during these student days? 
Well, it was in some ways, I think, at least as far as

19:37.906 --> 19:45.980
my experience is concerned, it was sort of a follow 
on to my experiences in the Marine Corps. By the

19:46.000 --> 19:57.861
time I had finished boot camp in the Marine Corps, I 
was convinced we were the toughest rascals in the

19:46.000 --> 19:57.861
world and that there was nobody can stand up to us. 
It sort of felt the same way come day in and day out.

20:02.469 --> 20:02.850
We were not the most prestigious place in the 
world, but we had the spirit, we were the good guys.

20:11.341 --> 20:30.338
And it was something that after a while, you sort of 
get to where you're defending the flag against

20:11.341 --> 20:30.338
anyone who wants to mistreat you or say anything 
derogatory about A&M. And it sort of builds on

20:31.299 --> 20:33.681
that. And it lasts a long time. I need to take a 
break. Yeah. How did your Aggie loyalties and

20:41.925 --> 20:52.655
fondness and commitment and debt, how did that 
begin to develop? I think it's, well, one of the

20:54.617 --> 20:59.702
things I think is that you develop an esprit de 
corps because of some of the hardships you go

21:01.859 --> 21:13.492
through that sort of bonds you to not only the other 
individuals but to the organization. I've always

21:13.532 --> 21:30.752
felt that one of the luckiest things that I've been 
had happen to me is go to a poor little country

21:13.532 --> 21:30.752
school where you didn't really have a whole lot to 
go into the Marine Corps which was considered to be

21:13.532 --> 21:30.752
the you've got what was left over from the Navy and 
nobody paid that, you know, they didn't really

21:31.745 --> 21:40.914
have appropriations in your equipment and all 
that sort of thing. So you did the best you could

21:40.934 --> 21:43.037
with what you had. And to a certain extent, it 
started that way with A&M. So that I think was sort

21:48.522 --> 21:58.933
of what helped to develop the esprit de corps that 
I've had with A&M and that I think many others have

21:48.522 --> 21:58.933
had that this is a tough place. And did you realize 
that was developing while you were an

22:02.768 --> 22:07.694
undergraduate here? Probably not. Probably not. 
I just, you know, it happened in retrospect. I was

22:12.421 --> 22:22.474
just sort of thinking about the good consequences 
that come from what you consider at the time to be

22:12.421 --> 22:22.474
sort of hard times. It's good for you. Those two 
years in the Corps. So you went to Silver Taps then.

22:27.755 --> 22:28.876
Oh, yes. Do you remember Muster as an 
undergraduate? Not much. I know I did go to Muster

22:33.341 --> 22:36.644
my senior year. I do recall that. But I think that's 
about the only one that I went to while I was an

22:38.566 --> 22:42.450
undergraduate. And where was it held? Do you 
remember? Steps of the MSC? Or what? No, it wasn't

22:48.316 --> 22:49.377
finished yet. The MSC wasn't finished until 50. I 
think it was Gine Hall. Okay. Okay. At that time.

22:57.847 --> 23:00.530
What about Final Review, your senior year? Well, 
Final Review was a big deal. Describe that. What

23:04.193 --> 23:05.234
made it a big deal? Well, of course, that was the 
changing of the guard, as it were, of the juniors

23:05.695 --> 23:14.003
getting to become seniors. And the senior year, as 
I said,

23:14.103 --> 23:21.030
having the... turn over your responsibilities in 
the wing to your next one that was coming up was very

23:21.348 --> 23:30.838
impressive. It was a very moving experience for me 
to find a review. How did you feel that previous

23:39.346 --> 23:44.471
year when you put on those boots for the first time 
officially? I thought that that was probably a

23:44.712 --> 23:50.157
great time of my life to be able to finally get to 
wear a pair of senior boots, and be a member of the

23:50.828 --> 24:00.504
leading class at Texas A&M for the next year. How 
much did they cost, do you remember? Well, of

24:02.927 --> 24:05.291
course, I bought mine secondhand. Sold them again 
when I got through. Remember what you paid for

24:08.116 --> 24:09.298
them? I think I paid $52 for them. And they fit 
reasonably well? Reasonably well. I went on a trip

24:16.006 --> 24:18.729
one time with my roommate. He and I decided on 
Friday afternoon that we were going to see, he knew

24:19.129 --> 24:25.937
a couple of girls up, and he was from Monroe, 
Louisiana. And he had a girlfriend up right across

24:26.778 --> 24:31.683
the line in Arkansas. So we were going up to visit. 
We didn't take anything but boots and boot pants,

24:34.266 --> 24:39.912
and that was the most miserable weekend I've ever 
spent. Old wool pants and hot and steamy and old

24:39.932 --> 24:43.415
boots. I was glad to get home and get to take those 
off. No, but they were a visible mark of you've

24:46.465 --> 24:51.152
gotten somewhere. And that ring, how special was 
that? Very special, still is, even though I've

24:55.178 --> 25:03.871
shrunk down now to where I have to wrap it with tape 
to keep it on my finger, but I've worn it

24:55.178 --> 25:03.871
continuously ever since then. Do you remember 
what it cost? Exactly. I think, again, it was in the

25:07.605 --> 25:16.038
range of between, I think in the $45 to $50 range, 
which was a lot of money. Of course, it's not the

25:16.058 --> 25:24.751
only thing we bought for my grandson's ring, and I 
think it was $375 or something like that. Do you

25:25.412 --> 25:27.955
have any ring stories to tell? You lost it or 
somebody spotted that ring on your finger? That

25:33.682 --> 25:37.567
happens to me all the time, particularly, I think, 
because it's worn down so much. And the ones that I

25:37.587 --> 25:44.537
get that I always want to come up to are the new 
graduates, the ones that have gotten their ring in

25:37.587 --> 25:44.537
the last year or two. They say, is mine going to look 
like that one of these days? What did you do to get it

25:50.846 --> 25:52.989
all worn down like that? Well, I just kept it on my 
finger all the time. Have you ever had it spotted

25:56.874 --> 26:00.839
somewhere on the other side of the world? Yes. in 
Africa. We were down in Nairobi and of all places.

26:11.537 --> 26:12.859
Of course they got bars everywhere. We were in a bar 
and I happened to have my hand up on that and the guy

26:12.919 --> 26:19.865
sitting next to me said, that sure looks like an 
Aggie ring. And of course he had one too. He had

26:23.367 --> 26:33.456
lived there for several years and of course I guess 
that was the first one he'd seen in a while. All

26:33.976 --> 26:41.685
right, Aggie, at your final, final review, who 
came that was special? Well, my family, my mother

26:42.986 --> 26:49.754
and dad, did not really travel a whole lot. We were 
country folks and didn't go, and they did not come,

26:49.774 --> 27:03.510
but I had, oh, let's see, I had one of my brothers, 
two of my brothers were here. for a final review,

27:03.710 --> 27:07.114
and their family. So it was a... And then 
commencement was held where?

27:16.246 --> 27:16.687
Outdoors? I think it was outdoors. I really do. Do 
you remember who the speaker was? No. Wasn't that

27:24.317 --> 27:25.919
year with Eisenhower? I don't think so. And what 
kind of, What kind of world did you think you were

27:31.030 --> 27:33.714
going out into? If you recall, 1950 was not a good 
year. Jobs were hard to find. Even graduate

27:44.390 --> 27:53.383
positions, graduate school student positions 
were getting hard to find, you know,

27:44.390 --> 27:53.383
assistantships and fellowships and so forth. So I 
thought that, you know, I had better, I wanted to go

27:53.403 --> 28:00.413
ahead and go ahead and finish up getting at least a 
master's degree and hopefully going to have a PhD

28:01.034 --> 28:30.147
sometime and say that opportunity to do that you 
know that field and I didn't I didn't have jobs

28:01.034 --> 28:30.147
waiting for me so I got an assistantship in the ag 
eco department and I was very happy to get that

28:01.034 --> 28:30.147
under John McNeely and that was for the fall of 1950 
for the fall of that fall and I worked we developed

28:01.034 --> 28:30.147
the uh a model livestock auction system where we 
got to travel all over the state and look at all the

28:31.561 --> 28:46.178
livestock auction sales and at that time 1950 was 
the time when Cattle prices were very volatile,

28:46.900 --> 28:57.451
and we had people that were making a living by 
buying 500 head of cattle here and selling them

28:46.900 --> 28:57.451
over here the next day. And they were wearing the 
cattle out, just moving them from one auction to

28:57.551 --> 29:00.855
the other. And when did you learn you were going to 
get that assistantship? How long before

29:06.461 --> 29:08.683
commencement? Not until after commencement. 
When I left, I didn't really have a job. waiting for

29:15.487 --> 29:16.508
me. I told him that he was looking into it, but then 
shortly after that, he said, you know, he had money

29:17.049 --> 29:22.655
for it. You remember what the stipend was? $125 a 
month. But you, let's see, no, you'd used up your GI

29:28.821 --> 29:31.745
Bill. Used up the GI Bill. Yeah, yeah. And so that 
began in the fall of 50. Yeah. Where were you, what

29:37.751 --> 29:43.317
did you think when you heard about the invasion of 
of Korea by North Korea. I began to wonder if I'd

29:48.895 --> 30:03.838
really made a mistake in going ahead and getting 
that commission because it looked like they were

29:48.895 --> 30:03.838
going to call up a bunch of us who had served less 
than four or five years in the military and was

29:48.895 --> 30:03.838
quite concerned. And they did call up a number of 
people that I graduated with. In fact, my roommate

30:08.245 --> 30:09.807
was called up. He had served only a very brief time 
in the Air Force. And he was called up for the Korean

30:14.144 --> 30:20.050
War. Now, your commission was Army or Air Force? 
Air Force. Air Force. But non-pilot.

30:28.338 --> 30:34.003
I probably was the oldest second lieutenant ever 
in the Air Force. I got my commission, went into the

30:34.023 --> 30:38.828
reserves, never went to a meeting or anything like 
that. And so after about three years, they called

30:38.888 --> 30:41.130
me and said, Are you really still on the books as a 
second? We don't have second lieutenants that

30:44.953 --> 30:49.400
spend two or three years in rank. We need to get you 
either active or get you discharged. I said, well,

30:54.347 --> 31:00.497
obviously I'm not doing anything in here, so let's 
just go ahead and discharge. All right, so

31:01.118 --> 31:08.348
summarize your, was it two years working on your 
master's as assistant? No, it only took a year. A

31:10.452 --> 31:10.712
year. And by the time I was married, I got married 
between the time of finals and graduation. All

31:20.509 --> 31:22.795
right, now I have this special...
