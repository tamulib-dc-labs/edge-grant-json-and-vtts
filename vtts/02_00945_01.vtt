WEBVTT

00:01.297 --> 00:06.746
We are in the office of Nestor Valencia, the 
planning director for El Paso. Nestor has taken

00:08.689 --> 00:16.521
time off to visit with us during his leave, for 
which I wish to thank him. And I have a list of

00:17.743 --> 00:22.410
questions here, Nestor, that we might want to 
follow. To the best of your ability, what do you

00:22.762 --> 00:33.078
remember was the first time that legislative 
authorization for planning occurred in El Paso?

00:36.183 --> 00:47.841
Well, I think we need to go back to the George 
Kessler period, and the exact date of

00:48.496 --> 00:52.921
authorization for legislation for planning in El 
Paso is, I don't know. We can look it up. Planning in

00:57.926 --> 01:03.091
El Paso has a long history.

01:04.433 --> 01:15.364
It is undoubtedly a pioneer in the state of Texas 
that El Paso had planning long before any other

01:04.433 --> 01:15.364
city in Texas ever thought of having city 
planning. We have to get a date on it. Well, yeah,

01:20.985 --> 01:23.788
we're going to get some dates. And it was a sort of a 
quirk of luck at somebody's expense of health,

01:24.709 --> 01:41.487
because as you remember, there's a Mr. George 
Kessler involved, who was a final architect. He

01:42.243 --> 02:08.228
was immigrated, I think, from Germany to the 
United States at an early age, and became one of the

01:42.243 --> 02:08.228
most prominent planner-architects in the United 
States, I'd say, between the period of 1890 to

01:42.243 --> 02:08.228
1920.

02:08.248 --> 02:09.870
Mr. Kessler is He is an author of many city planning 
documents in the United States,

02:11.504 --> 02:24.542
and he worked out of St. Louis. As I remember, 
Jonathan Cunningham had his plan reproduced on

02:26.345 --> 02:36.820
the anniversary of the 1925 plan for El Paso. We 
were fortunate to find I would say about 50 or 60

02:42.183 --> 02:55.018
copies of the original Kessler plant in the old 
city hall attic when the building was demolished.

02:55.058 --> 03:06.632
So they were perfectly well preserved and intact 
and in their own pocket envelopes. So they were in

03:07.173 --> 03:10.857
exceptional shape. People bagged this with... 
They were found about 1960. And they were complete

03:20.451 --> 03:34.228
comprehensive plans that had come off the print 
shop but had never ever been touched or used. Is

03:34.248 --> 03:37.131
there any chance of getting one of those for 
archives?

03:39.608 --> 03:44.012
Probably not the original. The original, 
unfortunately, the 40 or 50 originals were very

03:44.072 --> 04:02.191
poorly handled in that everybody was, not 
everybody, but people began to get copies and

03:44.072 --> 04:02.191
copies and they were distributed. 
Unfortunately, they should have been kept for

04:02.311 --> 04:08.417
planning purposes. I have an original copy in my 
office which is, you know, belongs to the plan. I

04:17.598 --> 04:33.882
have reproduced the plan, I've republished it, a 
hundred copies

04:17.598 --> 04:33.882
of it, which is certainly not the same quality as 
the original, but nonetheless it's a Oh, it's an

04:36.359 --> 04:44.289
effort to perpetuate the original Kessler plan or 
the 1925 plan in the city. But you can certainly,

04:44.309 --> 04:52.681
you're welcome to one of the copies that we have 
reproduced. But Kessler was sent to a place by his

04:54.443 --> 05:03.835
doctors to a drug client. He was in ill health. And 
he had visited El Paso from time to time and had

05:06.346 --> 05:23.965
encouraged friends in the community to begin 
looking at El Paso for the possibility of

05:06.346 --> 05:23.965
developing a master plan. He encouraged a few 
friends and there were probably two reasons for

05:24.005 --> 05:35.037
Kessler to encourage his friends. would like to be 
the consultant for El Paso at that time. And

05:39.952 --> 05:51.864
secondly, he felt the professional need that a 
city like El Paso should have a master plan,

05:39.952 --> 05:51.864
regardless of whether he got hired or not. I think 
Kessler was of the vintage whose primary concern

05:52.104 --> 06:05.597
was that the city could get a master plan underway 
and adopted by a mayor and council. So what

06:06.607 --> 06:12.536
happened was a combination of both. Mr. Kessler 
was was hired as a consultant and Mr. Kessler

06:12.837 --> 06:27.479
engineered the first city plant for El Paso. He 
must have been hired around 1923 or 1924. He was

06:31.185 --> 06:32.547
hired There was a city plant commission 
established in El Paso in 1919. And I think Kessler

06:38.082 --> 06:46.712
had already visited El Paso prior

06:38.082 --> 06:46.712
to that. But at any rate, between 1919 and 1924, 
Kessler's major efforts were made to develop the

06:47.513 --> 07:03.293
master plant. Just before he finished his plan, he 
died. And so the city engineer, Walter E.

07:09.800 --> 07:34.191
Stockwell, Walter E. Stockwell was the key person 
to carry on all of Kessler's work through to

07:09.800 --> 07:34.191
completion, publish the plan, and get it adopted 
by the mayor's council as the official plan for the

07:09.800 --> 07:34.191
city. Walter E. Stockwell picked it up from that 
point, I would say in 1824-25,

07:35.150 --> 07:54.643
a superior person who was the

07:35.150 --> 07:54.643
city plan engineer. Down 1924 all the way up to 
probably 1952. Is that right? It's a long tenure,

08:03.854 --> 08:07.621
yeah.

08:09.064 --> 08:16.277
He was an interesting person because he was

08:09.064 --> 08:16.277
planner-engineer. Well, it's not unusual in the 
United States to have a plant arrangement as a

08:16.831 --> 08:24.003
combination of foliage and planting efforts. But 
I think Walter was more of a planter at heart in that

08:24.023 --> 08:43.615
by 1930, well,

08:24.023 --> 08:43.615
the Plant Commission was already in operation, 
say, during the decade of the 20s, a lot of the

08:24.023 --> 08:43.615
decade. There is also a Robert G. Report, which is a 
capital improvement program. It's, I recall,

08:53.293 --> 08:58.920
headed by the Planning

08:53.293 --> 08:58.920
Commission in the 20s. Some cities are just 
getting around to doing that now. And we had

09:02.244 --> 09:07.211
official zoning adopted by the city in 1830. So our 
first official zoning map, our first official...

09:14.678 --> 09:17.481
zoning ordinances were in 1930. That was my next 
question. So, and right after Stockwell came, I

09:20.985 --> 09:26.231
fell off. I had a hard time in the 50s in that my 
recollection of planning was Kessler,

09:27.633 --> 09:39.927
Stockwell, and then after Stockwell came, Wingo. 
How do you spell it? Just Wingo. W-I-N-G-O.

09:49.766 --> 09:50.186
Go ahead. So after it was Wingo in the 50s, and then 
you were a little sketchy, you thought. Well, I

09:58.495 --> 10:04.041
think after Wingo,

10:05.388 --> 10:07.992
John Cunningham came and took over. So that's... 
You don't remember the year of that? 1958. 1958,

10:11.378 --> 10:19.471
John came in, no, Cunningham came in 1957. 
Probably about November of 57.

10:26.127 --> 10:35.098
So I don't recall knowing of any other director of 
planning other than Wingle. And then you took over

10:36.339 --> 10:40.485
in 1980. How

10:40.685 --> 10:50.717
would you say that your style of directorship 
differs from Jonathan's?

10:58.173 --> 11:00.637
That's a very difficult question. It really is 
because

11:00.657 --> 11:20.152
John Cunningham's

11:00.657 --> 11:20.152
career in planning

11:00.657 --> 11:20.152
parallels mine in no question. John was here a few 
months I moved here and assumed the directorship

11:23.266 --> 11:37.221
of planning back in 57, and I was the first person he 
hired after he came to El Paso. Of course, there was

11:39.043 --> 11:40.565
a lot of difference. John was a director and I was a 
junior planning aide or some beginning slot in the

11:40.645 --> 11:50.235
planning department, but I was very fortunate to 
be with Mr. Cunningham throughout his career in

11:51.127 --> 11:57.375
planning in El Paso. There were only two of you 
initially? In planning? No. We had a staff of, back

12:01.761 --> 12:05.446
then we had probably a staff of about 22. When he got 
here. Which was a very comfortable staff for the

12:10.272 --> 12:19.564
size of the city and the complexity of the job back 
then. John came here

12:20.371 --> 12:37.384
probably in November of 1957, and I came on board in 
February of 1958, just a few months after he got

12:20.371 --> 12:37.384
here. I was willing to relate that the difference 
is that he was already a professional planner,

12:38.410 --> 13:04.464
director, who had been in Spokane working, I 
believe he was director of planning, and had

12:38.410 --> 13:04.464
headed the Puget Sound Council of Governments. 
So, I am I interned with John Cunningham. My first

13:11.594 --> 13:27.469
ten years was working with Cunningham and then we,

13:11.594 --> 13:27.469
since the time that I started

13:28.850 --> 13:39.827
There was only one year from 1969 to 1970 that I was 
away doing work for the Council of Governments.

13:39.847 --> 13:47.679
Then back in 71 and 72, I was away in Costa Rica doing 
work. And back in 19... What sort of thing did you do

13:49.161 --> 13:56.072
in Costa Rica? City and regional planning, 
consulting work for

13:56.643 --> 14:05.892
the government of Costa Rica. The federal 
government of Costa Rica. Yeah. But I was also

14:11.498 --> 14:25.873
assistant director of planning for the city of El 
Paso in between...

14:28.621 --> 14:35.909
Somewhere in 1970, I was assistant director of 
planning for a while. Then I became urban

14:36.970 --> 14:46.700
coordinator

14:36.970 --> 14:46.700
between 72 and 73. And between 73

14:46.740 --> 14:57.531
and 75, I was away from the office because I was 
assistant director. executive assistant to

14:57.832 --> 14:59.815
Mayor Hervey. From 75 to 77, I was assistant to Don 
Henderson. And then from 77 to 1980, I was... Don

15:09.652 --> 15:16.023
Henderson was ex-mayor, ex-pro. And then between 
1977 and 1980, I was director of federal branch for

15:17.145 --> 15:23.215
the city. Pardon me. And then 1980, I took over the 
planet. So it's kind of been sporadic, but in the

15:29.578 --> 15:33.942
same general area. Mm-hmm. One question, though. 
To answer the question of, you know, the style of

15:37.585 --> 15:42.110
being . It's

15:43.411 --> 15:51.058
difficult to answer because At least for ten solid 
years, we worked very closely. I worked very

15:56.545 --> 15:58.308
closely with Cunningham. And for the next 
additional seven or eight years, we were in

15:58.328 --> 16:10.369
constant communication with local government.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.755
His style of planning was very i would say very 
classical it's a classical type of planning very

16:15.743 --> 16:42.325
strong on the principles in planning city 
planning very articulate man before the mayor

16:15.743 --> 16:42.325
council who was able to to defend

16:15.743 --> 16:42.325
planning's positioning not necessarily on 
feeling or on the politics of the day, but on true

16:43.250 --> 16:57.908
professional framework. Yeah. I think John 
Cunningham and I have the same approach to

17:01.533 --> 17:10.624
planning. We feel that planning is more than just 
the physical development of a plan. We happen to

17:16.337 --> 17:32.660
both think that planning in any city, 
specifically in El Paso, is more of a policy

17:16.337 --> 17:32.660
recommending department and not necessarily a 
line department.

17:35.203 --> 17:39.109
Planning should be closely related to the office 
of the mayor and there should be a considerable

17:40.692 --> 17:57.278
amount of interchange between the mayor and the 
department of planning. John felt very strong

17:58.260 --> 17:59.842
about this. He felt that of all of the departments 
in the city, planning was the focal point for for

18:09.464 --> 18:31.272
policy formulation and to give direction to the 
mayor and city council on matters which involve

18:09.464 --> 18:31.272
the community as opposed to being a process, a 
processing network, a machine that would process

18:09.464 --> 18:31.272
subdivisions and so on. I feel very strongly about 
that. I think

18:33.798 --> 19:00.565
engineering has its place, public works has its 
place, building inspection, traffic and

18:33.798 --> 19:00.565
transportation, and the very nature of planning 
puts planning in perhaps a more advantageous

18:33.798 --> 19:00.565
position over these other departments in terms of 
a global or a comprehensive view of the city or

19:00.781 --> 19:08.471
understanding

19:00.781 --> 19:08.471
of the city. Going back to comprehensive 
planning,

19:08.491 --> 19:19.346
El Paso has a long history of comprehensive 
citywide planning. And I'm wondering, is there

19:20.067 --> 19:27.717
any specific periodic review of El Paso's 
comprehensive plan? Does it occur annually or

19:28.085 --> 19:33.674
every five years or anything of that nature? We try 
to keep on a five to seven year revisit of the master

19:33.694 --> 19:41.086
plan. We are right now in the process of are 
upgrading our plan this year and next year. It's

19:49.559 --> 20:06.445
been about five years and five or six years now, so 
we are setting aside some monies for consulting

19:49.559 --> 20:06.445
work, some monies this year and next year, both 
local funds and community development funds to

20:06.425 --> 20:12.932
upgrade our plan. We're looking at it 
differently. We want to emphasize more or less a

20:17.377 --> 20:25.425
strategy plan rather than a 20-year company plan. 
Who will be doing that work? Well, planning. The

20:30.851 --> 20:33.073
Department of Planning is going to have to find 
time and ways and means of allowing some of the

20:34.403 --> 20:49.018
people internally to get out of the fast lanes and 
work on the plan 100%.

20:52.502 --> 21:04.174
If I had 100 people instead of 40 or such,

20:52.502 --> 21:04.174
we could still be on the fast track, every one of us. 
by just simply doing work that is either required,

21:05.032 --> 21:15.982
requested, or needed, which we have done. There's 
two or three baskets, that which we would like to

21:16.663 --> 21:33.739
do, that which

21:16.663 --> 21:33.739
needs to be done, and that which is necessary to do 
now. for political reasons, for

21:34.495 --> 21:46.408
the issues of the day, your priorities are 
sometimes set for you. So there are three or four

21:47.550 --> 21:56.179
flavors of projects that we can get involved in. 
And one of them is find enough time to do a company's

21:56.199 --> 22:01.245
plan. Of course, we're going to get some money, 
$100,000 for consulting. I see. You will have

22:06.207 --> 22:08.950
outside consultants. Oh, yeah. There's no way 
that we can do it internally. And even at that, even

22:12.354 --> 22:27.710
with the small amount of money that we're going to 
assemble, and with all the effort that we can

22:12.354 --> 22:27.710
muster internally, it's going to be a very skimpy 
revamp from this point. I realize that. You know,

22:31.111 --> 22:39.798
planning, as I was saying, planning in El Paso is no 
different from other parts of the United States

22:31.111 --> 22:39.798
and proud. The only difference is that we have a 
longer history in planning than most cities. One

22:46.304 --> 23:00.696
of the things that you find different in El Paso 
from other cities, and maybe not strikingly

22:46.304 --> 23:00.696
different in Texas, but certainly throughout the 
United States, is the fact that we don't have urban

22:46.304 --> 23:00.696
renewal. never had it and we probably won't have it 
where eminent domain plays a big role in

23:01.182 --> 23:11.793
redevelopment. Voters defeated that twice 
already and I don't think that there stands a

23:11.813 --> 23:19.060
chance to put it on the ballot again for the next 50 
years. That's political

23:20.922 --> 23:24.886
normal. So While other cities throughout the 
United States were going through urban renewal

23:27.068 --> 23:50.108
process in the late 50s and early 60s, El Paso was 
sort of a by itself city doing what it could in the

23:27.068 --> 23:50.108
planning process without any federal assistance 
whatsoever. It was not until the good old 701 came

23:50.128 --> 23:55.573
through that that we got any federal assistance 
planning. Prior to that, it was a relatively

23:59.150 --> 24:23.050
simple process of planning the neighborhood, 
classic neighborhood planning, the classic

23:59.150 --> 24:23.050
master plan, the classic land use, with little or 
no federal funding or interference or

23:59.150 --> 24:23.050
involvement. As time went on and and community 
development came into play and revenue sharing

24:26.131 --> 24:48.628
and we went public transit and we were beginning to 
get more and more federal involvement, the

24:26.131 --> 24:48.628
planning process became more complex. We now have 
to, you know, coordinate a lot of the issues with

24:49.570 --> 25:00.844
other agencies, which is good. The Highway 
Department,

25:01.165 --> 25:06.532
Community Development, HUD. And now it is more, it 
is not, it has become a little more complex because

25:07.853 --> 25:16.945
of of the natural things that have occurred 
throughout the United States. The council of

25:23.196 --> 25:31.928
governments prior to 1965 didn't exist in any way. 
The regional councils of government, then the

25:32.249 --> 25:47.590
camps program came to be, and which evolved into

25:32.249 --> 25:47.590
something else. Well, at any rate, the council 
government's movement in El Paso began in 1965.

25:57.264 --> 26:08.561
And so, you know, other issues such as the Chamizal 
settlement had, I think, a very significant

25:57.264 --> 26:08.561
impact on the planning of El Paso. For one thing, 
the Chamizal settlement brought about enough

26:15.565 --> 26:19.872
federal assistance to update our master plan. 
That was one of the byproducts of the

26:19.892 --> 26:31.189
international treaty between the United States 
and Mexico, and we got some money to upgrade our

26:19.892 --> 26:31.189
plan. And we did. Do you remember how much it was?

26:40.303 --> 26:43.328
I'm going to guess, but I think it was about 
$200,000. which then was a whole lot of money. Oh

26:48.088 --> 26:50.611
yeah, sure. Big bucks. But

26:53.674 --> 27:06.829
the Chummy's Isle was probably the biggest impact 
in terms of, you know, the planning process.

27:09.352 --> 27:11.374
Tax increment financing, is important, although 
very recent. We now have a tax-included financing

27:14.296 --> 27:19.301
district.

27:22.063 --> 27:24.086
That's about it.

27:27.369 --> 27:32.054
I think we have a viable zoning ordinance. We have a 
viable subdivision processing system. We have

27:37.920 --> 27:41.243
ETJ jurisdiction. We

27:41.982 --> 27:53.039
wish the heck we had more enforcement of zoning and 
subdivision activity, but we don't. But that's

27:53.059 --> 27:59.068
being here

27:53.059 --> 27:59.068
and there. I think the city has

27:59.088 --> 28:11.466
enjoyed some very excellent support by previous 
administrations. in mayors and councils, but

28:12.560 --> 28:19.187
would you care to point out any individuals by 
name? Sure. Peter DeWitter, 69, 69-71.

28:27.317 --> 28:38.449
Judson Williams, very strong mayor and very 
strong supporter of planning, 63 to probably 69.

28:39.678 --> 28:46.729
Raymond Theus was a very strong supporter and is 
still a very strong supporter of city planning.

28:46.749 --> 28:48.872
How did he spell his last name? T-E-L-L-E-S. 
Raymond Theus was subsequently an ambassador to

28:49.092 --> 29:00.850
Costa Rica in the United States, and is now living 
in El Paso. So we've had Theus, we have had Judson

29:00.870 --> 29:07.660
Williams, Peter DeWetter, We have had Don 
Henderson who was a strong supporter of City

29:08.517 --> 29:13.444
Planning. His period was between 75 and 77.

29:20.074 --> 29:32.652
We certainly have had excellent support, super 
excellent support by now Mayor Jonathan Rogers

29:20.074 --> 29:32.652
who came into office in Well, he came to us in 1981 
and he is a very strong believer and a very strong

29:35.028 --> 29:53.080
believer to uphold the decisions of the city plan 
commission. Strongly supports plan commission

29:53.100 --> 29:58.470
decisions at the council level. seldom, and I 
don't recall one time that the mayor himself has

29:59.024 --> 30:05.571
ever gone against the workers in the last four 
years. That's remarkable. It is. He knows real

30:10.476 --> 30:18.766
estate, he knows development, and he knows about 
income. So I think El Paso has enjoyed some

30:18.786 --> 30:27.495
excellent administrations as far as political 
support

30:27.830 --> 30:33.138
is concerned. What about the relationship of the 
city to state government? Has there been much, in a

30:37.745 --> 30:48.262
way, of benefits from the state or otherwise, from 
the point of view of planning? Not really.

30:53.260 --> 30:58.085
other than working very closely with the state 
highway department. And there has been some

30:59.286 --> 31:17.284
periods of time that we have worked with the 
Governor's Office of Economic Development

30:59.286 --> 31:17.284
related to border conferences and border 
regional commissions and that sort of thing. The

31:19.206 --> 31:22.069
state is very much not involved.
