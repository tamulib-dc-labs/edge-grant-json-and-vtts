WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:02.864
It's for them.

00:04.606 --> 00:09.012
Well, just don't be afraid of getting your hands dirty and work.

00:09.052 --> 00:18.005
The word work is, I know some people don't like to hear that word, but I think it's a good word.

00:18.025 --> 00:21.930
It takes work in every field, doesn't it, no matter what you're in.

00:21.950 --> 00:22.150
All right.

00:22.170 --> 00:28.299
If you could make a major gift to Texas A&M, let's make believe somebody walked up to you and gave you a check for a million dollars.

00:29.060 --> 00:29.160
Yeah.

00:29.596 --> 00:37.087
and the only requirement was you had to pass it on to A&M, for what purpose would you want a major gift used?

00:37.127 --> 00:39.150
What would you want A&M to do with it?

00:40.452 --> 00:41.694
Well, I would say divide it up.

00:41.794 --> 00:44.979
I wouldn't just put it all in the Veterinary Ministry.

00:44.999 --> 00:46.722
For what purposes?

00:47.563 --> 00:52.110
Well, for scholarships and whatever they needed at worst.

00:53.660 --> 01:03.851
I might mention that my second cousin, and by the way, this is kind of a long story, but when I was 10 years old, I grew up hunting.

01:04.351 --> 01:05.432
My dad was a great hunter.

01:05.773 --> 01:23.211
By the time I was 10, I was an experienced duck hunter, so my dad couldn't get away from the lab one year when this, his first cousin, my second cousin, who was, well, he'd been eight, nine years old, he was a young man, came down to Amarillo, and

01:23.562 --> 01:27.566
He wanted to go duck hunting, and so Dad sent me with him at 10 years of age.

01:27.827 --> 01:30.910
Of course, he could drive, so we drove out on a pretty day.

01:30.930 --> 01:33.553
It wasn't much of a duck hunting day, but just to get out and all.

01:33.573 --> 01:39.399
But Dad had enough confidence in me at 10 years old that I could go with him and show him where he'd go along.

01:39.419 --> 01:44.865
But anyhow, this same man just a year or two ago died at 90-something years old.

01:45.206 --> 01:48.169
He gave the Oklahoma State...

01:48.588 --> 01:50.950
Of course, he started out as a bank teller in Oklahoma.

01:50.970 --> 01:53.833
He gave them a million dollar gift, the business college.

01:54.954 --> 01:57.957
So I had the privilege of taking him duck.

01:58.058 --> 02:05.605
To what people from your years here, to what people do you feel the deepest gratitude?

02:06.426 --> 02:08.928
Your former students or teachers?

02:09.929 --> 02:11.751
Whom do you tell me you're most grateful?

02:11.771 --> 02:14.494
Well, the former students in those days when I was here,

02:14.930 --> 02:20.856
uh it was a dollar a year i think in those days no no i mean which individuals oh individuals

02:21.224 --> 02:24.147
I would say my teachers in the veterinary school.

02:24.207 --> 02:25.268
Which ones?

02:25.388 --> 02:33.176
Well, Dr. Dunn, Dr. Milleth, Leonard, Dr. Leonard.

02:34.397 --> 02:36.659
Those all, I think, had a great effect on me.

02:38.441 --> 02:40.303
And then Dr. Doak over in biology.

02:40.423 --> 02:41.164
I remember him.

02:41.224 --> 02:47.350
And, you know, old Count Cigari, if he was... Of course, I didn't know him very well, but I sure remember.

02:47.600 --> 02:52.772
when somebody, Mr. Cigar, if the book didn't say that, throw the book out the window.

02:52.792 --> 02:55.939
That's what his favorite statement is.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.204
All right, I'm near the end of it.

02:58.284 --> 02:59.386
What have we not covered?

02:59.607 --> 03:00.750
What of our omissions?

03:01.090 --> 03:02.734
Is there anything we've left out we should have?

03:04.759 --> 03:05.440
Well, um,

03:07.681 --> 03:20.814
Well, my father and mother came here in 37 to see me, and Dr. Marsteller had us over at his home on the thing for lunch with his wife, and then at another time, Dr. Hagen.

03:21.275 --> 03:30.684
See, my father never wanted a lot of publicity, and he didn't get it, but, which I'll give you his book, copy of his book, but Dr. Hagen was dean of Carnell.

03:30.805 --> 03:32.987
He came here, down here one year.

03:33.047 --> 03:37.131
I don't think he just came to, he was on a committee to see, I think, to see

03:37.432 --> 04:00.520
about A&M's veterinary school what they might need and so on and so anyhow his father was Dr. Hagan who was dean of veterinary school at Cornell for some years came here and but anyhow his father came from Kansas down and was foreman at my father's plant in Amarillo and

04:00.922 --> 04:06.227
And then he was just my own real grandfather.

04:06.647 --> 04:19.620
My father's father died when he was only nine in Chicago, but my mother's father was my grandfather, but I only saw him occasionally in Kansas where Mr. Hagan was more or less a day-to-day grandfather up there in Amarillo.

04:20.140 --> 04:23.283
He was my father's foreman, but his son was the one that was dean.

04:23.364 --> 04:29.089
And so my father and the Hagans were acquainted back in Kansas.

04:30.605 --> 04:31.506
So I don't know.

04:31.566 --> 04:33.047
It seemed like we were pretty well covered.

04:33.428 --> 04:33.828
Let's see.

04:34.769 --> 04:35.650
I forgot to ask.

04:36.090 --> 04:37.932
Did you ever go into the steam tunnels?

04:40.915 --> 04:45.639
No, I remember, but I never... Did some of the guys go in down in the steam tunnels?

04:45.800 --> 04:53.647
I think they did, but I have no personal knowledge of what... Did you ever hear anything about the secret fraternities?

04:54.328 --> 04:55.169
No, never did.

04:56.009 --> 04:57.591
I don't know if they had them when I was here.

04:57.824 --> 04:58.825
I don't know either.

04:58.885 --> 05:00.567
I think they were, but I know.

05:00.587 --> 05:01.929
If they were, they were very secret.

05:03.131 --> 05:08.577
All right, then my last question is, what feelings do you hold in your heart for Texas A&M today?

05:10.079 --> 05:16.247
Oh, I think very much a pride that I'm an Aggie.

05:16.287 --> 05:24.297
And I didn't resent, of course, the coeducational part because I have daughters.

05:24.697 --> 05:27.561
In fact, I have a brother that's an Aggie.

05:27.895 --> 05:33.720
There were six of us brothers and four of us

05:35.168 --> 06:04.450
are living and one brother that passed away went to Kansas State and the other brother was went to Arkansas but then two brothers went to the University of Texas and two of us from A&M and then I have let's see this daughter that was here the oldest daughter Mary Ann she met she was here a summer but then my daughter Judy whom you haven't met I guess that had was in one of your classes in history Judy

06:04.683 --> 06:16.324
She finished the first, she was the first woman to graduate in journalism here in 68, and she was an Aggie, and then the other daughter, Betty, got a, I believe she got two degrees.

06:16.345 --> 06:17.627
She's with the Extension Service.

06:18.308 --> 06:20.953
Betty, well, she, Harrelson's her married name.

06:21.473 --> 06:27.321
And she's an A&M, so there's at least four of the family that's Aggies.

06:27.861 --> 06:33.789
And tell that daughter that was in my class, that was among the first in journalism, tell her to call me at her convenience.

06:33.849 --> 06:37.954
I'd like to interview her about what it was like to be a co-ed in those years.

06:38.916 --> 06:39.256
Okay.

06:39.496 --> 06:40.778
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

06:41.599 --> 06:46.165
I don't want to take her glory away, but she got to be a good friend of...

06:47.242 --> 06:48.784
who was director of MSC?

06:49.285 --> 06:49.825
Wayne Stark.

06:49.845 --> 06:50.346
Wayne Stark.

06:50.566 --> 07:00.699
She got to be a good friend of him, and so one time she asked him what she could do when they were cutting trees out here in the woods, and he said, well, you could take them donuts and coffee.

07:00.719 --> 07:06.707
So she was one of the, if not the original one, one of the original donut dollages, as they used to call them.

07:06.727 --> 07:10.191
So, yeah, she'd like to meet you, and I know.

07:10.211 --> 07:12.134
And your office is here in the Evans Library.

07:12.154 --> 07:12.995
Yes, sir.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.296
All right, I don't have anything else.

07:14.317 --> 07:15.017
Let's quit there.

07:15.358 --> 07:17.080
Well, all right, let me get you a copy of that.
