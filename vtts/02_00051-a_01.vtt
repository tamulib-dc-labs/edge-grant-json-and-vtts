00:02.984 --> 00:22.123
this is may the first we're sitting in the former students of the williams building the cleaton williams building getting ready to chat with jerry cooper jerry test yours now well i don't know what to say i guess we could add on there that i'm class of 63. okay

00:25.343 --> 00:39.037
Jerry, for the sake of someone who may hear this tape or read the transcription in the years to come and might not be acquainted with you, give a biographical summary of your growing up.

00:39.057 --> 00:39.898
Where did you grow up?

00:40.379 --> 00:41.380
Where did you go to high school?

00:43.662 --> 00:49.528
What happened to you before you came to College Station as a student?

00:50.167 --> 00:55.494
I was born in Houston and moved to Texas City when I was finishing elementary school.

00:55.574 --> 00:58.778
So I went to junior high and high school in Texas City.

00:59.779 --> 01:05.266
And from there, I came directly to A&M after a summer out at Junction.

01:06.187 --> 01:10.813
And I stayed here for about two and a half years.

01:12.055 --> 01:15.359
And Hurricane Carla hit down on the coast.

01:15.720 --> 01:20.005
And I spent some time down there at the beginning of the semester trying to help clean up.

01:20.828 --> 01:32.345
And I thought after I got back up here that I was catching up and doing what I was supposed to do, but my grades didn't reflect it at the end of the semester, so I laid out of school for two years and worked in Houston.

01:33.166 --> 01:43.301
And then I came back, that was in 62, came back in 64, and I finished up another two and a half years and graduated in 66.

01:43.321 --> 01:43.441
Okay.

01:43.621 --> 01:46.245
I was originally class of 63.

01:46.799 --> 01:47.760
Let's back up.

01:47.860 --> 01:54.207
As a historian, I've got to ask, and I presume you were too young to remember the Texas City explosion.

01:54.428 --> 01:55.849
Well, my parents remember.

01:55.909 --> 02:02.156
We lived in Houston at that time, and they remember the windows shaking up there, but no, we weren't there.

02:02.237 --> 02:05.700
But we did end up getting to know an awful lot of people who did live through it.

02:06.041 --> 02:08.784
Matter of fact, my wife was one of them.

02:08.804 --> 02:11.507
All right, one of the important first questions.

02:12.112 --> 02:14.094
Why did you come to Texas A&M?

02:14.175 --> 02:15.917
Why here instead of some other place?

02:16.417 --> 02:17.519
That's an easy choice.

02:18.360 --> 02:24.387
My dad went to school here for about one year and then had to drop out and go to work in Houston.

02:25.128 --> 02:32.537
And he always told people that the worst kind of Aggies were the ones that only went for a short time because he said they talked the loudest and the longest about the place.

02:33.438 --> 02:39.165
I mean, I was probably hardly out of diapers before we were singing the Aggie War hymn and learning all the

02:39.500 --> 02:45.027
various campusology things about A&M and of course I followed my brother up here.

02:45.347 --> 02:47.890
He preceded me by about three years.

02:48.892 --> 02:50.614
So you came to visit many times?

02:50.834 --> 02:52.756
Oh yes, came a lot of weekends.

02:52.836 --> 03:08.055
One of the funniest tales was we came up for a football weekend and of course I was riding with a lot of girls who were dating Aggies and a next door neighbor of ours was in the car and we're going down the street and we're seeing all these corps members in uniform walking around

03:08.727 --> 03:13.674
And she blurts out, she says, gee, I wish they'd take their uniforms off so I could tell who they are.

03:15.517 --> 03:19.502
We never did let her live that one down.

03:19.522 --> 03:25.951
So you don't remember then your first visit because you may have come as a little bitty child.

03:26.292 --> 03:29.176
Well, probably I was junior high school age.

03:29.877 --> 03:35.545
I may have been up here before that, but that was when my brother came up here as I was finishing junior high and

03:35.896 --> 03:42.605
That's my earliest real recollection, going in the Koch building when he went to register and get his paperwork straightened out.

03:43.907 --> 03:47.191
You graduate from high school and go to Junction that summer.

03:47.351 --> 03:48.473
That summer.

03:48.493 --> 03:52.978
Describe the Junction Annex, as I think we called it then.

03:52.998 --> 03:56.964
Describe that place physically.

03:57.564 --> 03:59.507
Where was it and what was there?

03:59.673 --> 04:02.838
Well, driving into it, it was fairly pleasant.

04:02.858 --> 04:11.030
There were a lot of large trees, and they had these barracks-type screened-in buildings with ten roofs on them.

04:11.050 --> 04:19.723
And, of course, we'd all read the stories about Bear Bryant taking his players out there, and we kind of figured the worst was going to happen, but it really was pretty nice.

04:20.665 --> 04:24.270
We didn't have to get out and play football on the hardscrabble ground.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.794
We got to go swimming in the river and

04:27.247 --> 04:32.714
did a lot of other activities while we were there besides taking classes.

04:34.796 --> 04:38.621
These barracks, these small little huts or whatever, what did you all call them?

04:40.604 --> 04:42.766
I'm not sure if we had a name for them.

04:42.807 --> 04:43.507
I don't remember.

04:43.708 --> 04:46.671
Those little buildings, were they army surplus?

04:47.613 --> 04:49.335
They appear to be, yeah.

04:49.675 --> 04:51.457
I couldn't tell you for sure about that.

04:51.477 --> 04:56.764
They were just very spare buildings with bunk beds in them and

04:57.115 --> 05:00.339
And then, of course, they had a mess hall and another meeting hall area.

05:01.201 --> 05:04.505
This was on the river south of Junction?

05:05.106 --> 05:06.568
I guess it was south.

05:06.748 --> 05:07.830
Yeah, I think so.

05:07.970 --> 05:08.911
About how far to town?

05:09.932 --> 05:14.479
Oh, it was probably about a five-minute drive to town, not very far out.

05:15.921 --> 05:18.464
Describe the beginning.

05:18.504 --> 05:21.208
How were you received, you and the others?

05:22.309 --> 05:23.170
How were you welcomed?

05:24.272 --> 05:26.515
Well, I'm not...

05:26.782 --> 05:29.245
I'm sure my memory is too strong on all of that.

05:30.447 --> 05:38.998
The basic division was something that was in effect at A&M back then to counsel freshmen, and they pretty much ran the program out there.

05:40.881 --> 05:46.449
Let's see, I was trying to think of some of the people, I just can't call names right now.

05:46.529 --> 05:47.190
Austin Curley?

05:47.350 --> 05:53.498
Well, Austin Curley was of course there, and a gentleman whose name started with a K.

05:54.338 --> 05:59.183
It just won't come to me right now, but he was pretty much the ramrod of the whole place at that time.

05:59.964 --> 06:04.710
And Bob Barzak was one of the instructors in English out there.

06:05.470 --> 06:09.054
And I don't know.

06:09.074 --> 06:11.998
I don't have a whole lot of vivid memories.

06:12.018 --> 06:13.299
About how many students?

06:15.862 --> 06:16.383
Oh, let's see.

06:16.403 --> 06:20.447
There were about four or five barracks buildings and probably about

06:21.693 --> 06:25.418
Oh, maybe 15 people in each one.

06:25.438 --> 06:27.682
So less than 100?

06:27.862 --> 06:28.944
Yeah, I think so, about 100.

06:29.765 --> 06:36.254
Now, how did you and those others, how did you get selected to go out to Junction?

06:37.115 --> 06:49.633
Well, we applied for it, and I think we had to meet some kind of a deadline and all, but it was just submitting an application, and I don't know that there was a whole lot of other criteria other than first come, first serve.

06:50.074 --> 06:51.396
What courses did you take?

06:51.730 --> 06:53.012
Oh, they were very basic.

06:53.072 --> 06:59.082
I think English and math and I've got it on the transcript in there.

06:59.283 --> 07:10.141
I can probably show you that we took seven hours including our PE and I got an A in that for teaching three other guys how to swim while we were there.

07:10.902 --> 07:17.333
But I got pretty good grade points in all of my classes then and freshman year,

07:18.072 --> 07:23.940
I didn't do too well after I got to the campus, and if it wasn't for those grade points, I might have dropped out a few years earlier.

07:26.263 --> 07:31.149
Can you describe a routine of the typical class day out at Junction?

07:31.730 --> 07:32.551
What time did you get up?

07:32.891 --> 07:33.732
What happened when?

07:34.293 --> 07:44.907
Oh, I think we probably got up about, I don't know, 7, 7.30 and went to breakfast, and then probably had classes about 8 or 8.30,

07:45.545 --> 07:53.495
I think we had classes mostly in the morning, and then in the afternoon we had recreation periods and other activity things that were taking place.

07:54.577 --> 07:59.883
And you were so far from town, there couldn't be much mischief on the road, could there?

07:59.903 --> 08:00.544
Well, no.

08:01.005 --> 08:11.198
About the only people that went into town, there was one boy who lived in Junction, Robbie Carpenter, and I think he's a dentist out there now, but Robbie used to

08:11.532 --> 08:33.917
drive his truck in and then he'd occasionally walk out and one night he walked in and he was dragging something behind him and we didn't know what it was till we got up close and it was about a six-foot rattlesnake that he had found along the road and he had beat it in the head and dragged it back up there just to show us what we could expect if we went out on the road ourselves.

08:33.937 --> 08:35.358
You mentioned Bill Barzak.

08:35.418 --> 08:38.822
Were there any other teachers you had that summer that were

08:40.388 --> 08:42.893
I've racked my brain trying to remember them.

08:43.814 --> 08:46.800
I'm sorry, I can't come up.

08:46.820 --> 08:49.004
You were there six weeks or 12 weeks?

08:49.024 --> 08:52.030
I think it was just about a six weeks period.

08:52.050 --> 08:52.150
Okay.

08:52.170 --> 08:53.132
And then back home.

08:53.512 --> 08:56.197
Because they had, I think, two sessions in the summer.

08:56.217 --> 08:56.458
All right.

08:56.478 --> 09:00.185
Describe then coming up to College Station that fall.

09:00.926 --> 09:04.152
How did you get here and what did you bring and how were you welcomed?

09:04.773 --> 09:13.507
Well, we came up and there was about a week's orientation before the classes and all got underway.

09:14.288 --> 09:19.016
And they would give us orientation sessions in our different outfits.

09:19.076 --> 09:24.705
They would try to teach us how to start forming up so that we could learn how to march.

09:25.158 --> 09:27.823
And, of course, we had our meals in the mess hall.

09:28.564 --> 09:38.180
And one of the things I remember the most was a junior in my brother's outfit dropped handles with me.

09:38.220 --> 09:50.541
He was the first guy that ever dropped handles with me at A&M, which, as most anybody knows, is calling you by your first name and letting you call him by his first name instead of Mr. And that was Paul Martin, who was...

09:50.875 --> 09:54.179
been with the Jaworski Law Firm down in Houston for some years now.

09:54.199 --> 09:56.101
As a matter of fact, he may be retiring now.

09:56.861 --> 09:59.224
But that was one of my early memories.

09:59.985 --> 10:04.750
And it was mostly just getting acquainted and learning.

10:04.770 --> 10:08.494
We didn't have any sophomores around to speak of at that time.

10:08.594 --> 10:11.677
It was mostly juniors and seniors that were orienting us.

10:11.717 --> 10:17.844
So the sophomores, we didn't learn what they were going to be about until the next week or two.

10:17.864 --> 10:18.925
Mom and Dad brought you.

10:19.327 --> 10:24.114
Oh, yes, brought me, unloaded all the stuff in the car and helped me get it up in the room.

10:24.355 --> 10:28.381
And where did you, where was your room?

10:28.642 --> 10:30.565
I was in Moses Hall.

10:30.845 --> 10:34.451
We had, I think it was the second and third floors of Moses Hall.

10:35.272 --> 10:38.156
And same dorm my nephew lives in right now, by the way.

10:38.898 --> 10:44.186
And my brother was in the next dorm, Davis Gary Hall.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.810
Back then, we didn't call them by names.

10:46.910 --> 10:47.511
It was dorms.

10:47.913 --> 10:49.556
14, dorm 17.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.639
I mean, that's the only way we knew them, by numbers.

10:52.019 --> 10:52.580
What outfit?

10:52.961 --> 10:53.842
I was in A2.

10:54.223 --> 10:55.965
How did you get assigned to that?

10:56.085 --> 10:56.706
Do you know?

10:57.247 --> 11:00.893
I think they tried to split people up according to what their major was.

11:01.053 --> 11:03.977
And at that time, I was going to be a mechanical engineer.

11:04.739 --> 11:08.284
That lasted for about one semester until chemistry got a hold of me.

11:08.905 --> 11:17.522
And so it didn't take very long for their pairing people up with people in their particular discipline to change rapidly.

11:18.223 --> 11:21.790
And each outfit, I'm sure, had the same thing happen.

11:21.810 --> 11:24.636
They ended up being kind of a hodgepodge of different majors.

11:25.527 --> 11:35.398
Now, because of your brother's experience and your father, you knew pretty well what to bring when you came.

11:35.538 --> 11:42.606
Well, they gave us a list, I think, of the type of clothes and stuff and told us what sort of uniform pieces would be issued to us.

11:42.626 --> 11:45.489
What did you bring other than what was on that list?

11:48.152 --> 11:48.593
Oh, gosh.

11:48.613 --> 11:49.614
Did you bring a radio?

11:50.295 --> 11:54.319
Well, I later had a record player, one of those large console types.

11:54.653 --> 11:56.316
desktop record players.

11:57.198 --> 12:01.006
I don't remember bringing too much of anything else.

12:01.046 --> 12:01.587
Typewriter?

12:01.988 --> 12:05.254
No, no typewriter back then, although I probably could have used it.

12:05.515 --> 12:06.296
No furnishings?

12:08.120 --> 12:12.088
Not to speak of, except for bed linens and a few things like that.

12:12.811 --> 12:18.759
All right, and so you're oriented for a week or so, and then everybody gets here.

12:19.159 --> 12:22.704
And then we started finding out what it was all about.

12:23.164 --> 12:27.410
All right, describe those discoveries, some experiences.

12:27.730 --> 12:42.750
Well, you know, most people out of high school, unless they've been in ROTC or something, they've probably never experienced having regimentation, and we were pretty solidly regimented.

12:43.051 --> 12:51.904
We were told what to do, when to do it, and oftentimes how to do it, and then given a long list of things we better not do.

12:52.946 --> 13:03.302
And of course, the best lesson I learned, or maybe the worst, if you want to look at it that way, was when they told us that it was a freshman's privilege to do anything you could get away with.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.388
And of course, we learned a lot about how to get away with things.

13:09.089 --> 13:20.163
Can you share any of the incidents that were the first encounters with the sophomores and their attempts to get you all to be in line?

13:20.984 --> 13:25.190
I don't know about the first ones, but I remember some of the encounters for sure.

13:25.290 --> 13:25.950
Describe those.

13:26.191 --> 13:38.927
Well, they would try to come up with something that at least one freshman had done wrong, and then they would try to say they didn't know who did it and try to blame it on everybody.

13:39.464 --> 13:49.521
They'd take us down to the shower and we'd put on our rain ponchos and our helmet liners wearing virtually nothing else underneath and they'd turn the steam showers up.

13:50.142 --> 13:54.469
And we'd sit in there and just sweat until they decided to turn it off and let us back out of there.

13:55.471 --> 13:58.696
And we went through a number of those incidents.

14:00.018 --> 14:01.000
Did that have a name?

14:03.072 --> 14:04.894
I've never heard of a sweat out or anything.

14:04.914 --> 14:08.179
Well, the common term I think we used back then was crap out.

14:08.539 --> 14:09.160
A crap out?

14:10.182 --> 14:11.383
That was the hot treatment?

14:11.403 --> 14:11.964
The steam treatment?

14:11.984 --> 14:15.048
The idea was maybe somebody's not going to make it out of there without being carried.

14:16.109 --> 14:22.899
But it taught you togetherness a lot and made you realize that you had to depend on each other.

14:23.980 --> 14:31.510
And I don't know if my feelings were justified or not, but having a brother who was a senior in another outfit

14:32.722 --> 14:39.608
seemed to be viewed by a lot of my fellow freshmen in my outfit as some sort of privilege that I was able to get out of things.

14:40.409 --> 14:59.547
And as opposed to what they thought that I was enjoying, it really was harder because the other upperclassmen, particularly sophomores that might have happened to run across my brother at the wrong time of day or something, made my life pretty uncomfortable a lot of times.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.969
But they weren't the only ones.

15:02.708 --> 15:15.402
I remember one instance where I was walking to class and I didn't have the good sense enough to break and run and I ended up marching all the way across campus with two sophomores and going into dorm

15:16.073 --> 15:29.406
four I believe, no three, dorm three I think it was, and spent the entire afternoon doing push-ups and sit-ups and pink stool and all sorts of things there.

15:30.227 --> 15:39.537
And the only thing I really remember, I can't even remember the names of the guys who ran me through most of that stuff, but the room we were in belonged to Tom Ralph.

15:40.057 --> 15:42.840
Tom was a Yale leader who later died in Vietnam.

15:43.090 --> 15:50.598
And the main thing I remembered about him was that after a while he got tired of it and he told me just to get the hell out of there.

15:51.198 --> 15:57.725
And that was the only chance I had to leave because I think they'd have chased me down the hall before I got out of the dorm.

15:58.266 --> 16:03.711
Do you remember when you first had a paddle applied to your posterior?

16:04.893 --> 16:12.861
Well, that was done mostly in, you know, I won't say in jest, but

16:13.145 --> 16:26.665
It was a fun kind of thing in that our sophomores toward the end of the year would bend us over and spell out their names on our rear end and then drop handles with us.

16:27.686 --> 16:33.254
As far as anybody really using a board on anybody maliciously, it really didn't happen.

16:34.055 --> 16:35.878
And the only thing you had to worry about is that

16:36.162 --> 16:38.804
a whole lot of guys didn't drop handles with you on the same day.

16:40.586 --> 16:40.926
I see.

16:42.547 --> 16:47.432
Now, in dropping handles, describe the ceremony of that.

16:47.772 --> 16:50.034
Did somebody walk up and say something special?

16:50.894 --> 17:05.747
Usually it was just in conversation sometime that if a guy felt like it, he would just, you'd say something to him about yes sir, no sir, or something like that, or you'd call him by name, Mr. So-and-so.

17:06.149 --> 17:16.799
and usually the way it would happen would he'd say, how about just calling me by my first name, or how about calling me Dan or whatever it was, and that was it.

17:17.139 --> 17:23.425
And you'd turn around and say, sure, thanks, and shake hands with him, and from then on it would be first name basis.

17:24.486 --> 17:33.115
In retrospect, did that attention to learning people's names, did that prove to be a good capability?

17:33.935 --> 17:35.717
Well, it did.

17:36.592 --> 17:41.980
probably while I was here, but I think some sort of psychological misdirection.

17:42.040 --> 17:51.193
Ever since then, and I don't know if it's a backlash from having to do it then, I haven't paid nearly as much attention to remembering people's names as I should.

17:51.213 --> 17:58.043
So I guess I could have turned it into something more positive, but it helped me for a long time.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.654
All right, now, your freshman year is the fall of?

18:00.674 --> 18:01.535
1959.

18:01.555 --> 18:02.035
59.

18:02.796 --> 18:05.960
You and I then are here, we arrived at the same time.

18:06.120 --> 18:06.861
We're both freshmen.

18:07.061 --> 18:09.504
Describe registration.

18:11.046 --> 18:16.952
Registration, well, of course, for freshmen, it was pretty much laid out for you.

18:17.093 --> 18:20.997
I don't know, I don't think that first semester we went through formal registration.

18:21.398 --> 18:26.123
I think they pretty much signed us up for the classes we needed to take through the basic division.

18:26.677 --> 18:40.977
But from that point on, starting with the spring semester, we would have to get in a long line out on the sidewalks around Cebisa and wait our turn to go in and walk through the tables and register.

18:41.057 --> 18:46.364
And it was set up where you first met with the counselors.

18:46.424 --> 18:52.172
Then you went to the fee people and talked to them about what you were going to need to do.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.135
And then you went and signed up for your classes.

18:54.554 --> 19:03.263
And I think you came to another fee table further down where they added everything up and put your bill out and you made your payment or your installment payment.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.647
And that was long and time consuming.

19:06.667 --> 19:13.053
I think anybody from the late 50s and early 50s will remember those lines around Cebisa and how long you stood out in the sun.

19:13.694 --> 19:22.283
Now, one of the advantages I thought at that time was that the student made direct contact, though,

19:22.415 --> 19:28.724
with some faculty member in the department where each of the courses was going to be taken.

19:28.904 --> 19:30.126
Yes.

19:30.146 --> 19:38.158
And they could eliminate a lot of mistakes that a student might have made by taking the wrong course.

19:38.579 --> 19:41.042
Well, I think we had to take our classes.

19:41.122 --> 19:48.633
Once we got signed up for everything, we had to go back and have it checked by checkers, and they would look through to see what it was.

19:48.653 --> 19:51.257
And I think some of them did that sort of thing, others just

19:51.642 --> 20:03.601
check to make sure you didn't have too many total hours and that you weren't signed up for some class where you had to be at this side of campus one hour and the next hour over here where you weren't going to make it to class.

20:05.644 --> 20:14.899
As you went to those first classes, what did you, what was the routine in the classes for a first year freshman?

20:17.326 --> 20:26.140
How were they, what was the methodology, the standard of instruction?

20:26.160 --> 20:32.771
Well, a lot of them except for engineering drawing and things like that were primarily lecture classes.

20:33.552 --> 20:44.650
And so mostly it was just a matter of listening to the professor and taking notes or trying to keep up with what he was doing in the book as he went along.

20:45.760 --> 20:56.759
I'm afraid I was not very well versed in study habits back then, and so I probably should, if I'd have done what I should have done, I'd probably remember a whole lot more about it.

20:57.139 --> 21:00.986
How large were the enrollments in the various sections you took?

21:02.088 --> 21:07.397
I think most of the classes, except for chemistry, were like about...

21:07.934 --> 21:11.279
Oh, probably 30 people, 25, 30.

21:12.080 --> 21:17.528
Were they real faculty members or were they teaching assistants?

21:17.548 --> 21:22.054
I remember most of the classes were taught by faculty members.

21:22.074 --> 21:29.385
I don't remember too many teaching assistants except in areas like chemistry lab and things of that nature.

21:30.607 --> 21:31.708
About how many hours did you take?

21:31.768 --> 21:33.030
Do you remember that first year?

21:33.112 --> 21:39.422
That first semester I was up here, I probably took about 15, maybe 14 or 15.

21:39.783 --> 21:46.233
Did you have any of the legendary teachers either that semester or some other early semesters?

21:46.513 --> 21:53.284
Well, the only one I remember having was Screamin' Al Nelson, and you could hear him all the way down the hall.

21:54.105 --> 22:00.435
And the thing I remember most, when I probably should have been remembering some of the things he was really teaching,

22:01.073 --> 22:07.381
was his stories about going down to Mexico and being shanghaied by highway bandits.

22:07.401 --> 22:10.485
And he was a pretty colorful tale-teller.

22:12.467 --> 22:14.049
He did yell a lot.

22:14.510 --> 22:17.574
I know because I had a class across the hall from him one time.

22:18.114 --> 22:20.978
But in general, was he a highly capable teacher?

22:24.402 --> 22:28.988
Haskell, I really, I would,

22:29.795 --> 22:33.644
This probably isn't fair to him, but I would probably classify him as average.

22:34.165 --> 22:37.072
I think he spent an awful lot of time on things other than the subject matter.

22:37.994 --> 22:42.184
Now, I remember him as being very wrapped up in being anti-liberal.

22:43.808 --> 22:47.517
Franklin Roosevelt and other communists, I heard him say a couple of times,

22:48.104 --> 22:54.574
I'm sorry I can't address very much of that because I was not a real good student back then.

22:54.594 --> 22:57.939
Art, describe chow hall for a freshman.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.124
Where did y'all eat and what was the routine and so forth?

23:01.525 --> 23:11.260
Well, we lived on the north side there and so we ate in Sabisa Dining Hall upstairs and it was served family style and we had

23:11.628 --> 23:12.809
seating arrangements.

23:13.130 --> 23:19.756
I know my table had four freshmen, two sophomores, a junior, and a senior at it.

23:20.016 --> 23:28.825
And the thing I recall the most, of course, let me describe for you a little bit what the meal was like.

23:28.845 --> 23:34.291
The tables were all set with the, you know, the eating utensils and everything.

23:35.011 --> 23:39.576
And the mess hall waiters, we called them the Cebiza volunteers,

23:40.062 --> 23:46.210
would bring out family-sized bowls and place a couple of them on each table for you to serve yourself from.

23:46.271 --> 23:51.458
And, of course, you had to make sure the senior was served first, and then it went to the junior and then to the sophomores.

23:51.518 --> 23:55.703
And if you were lucky, you got some before it had to be sent back to the kitchen to be refilled.

23:56.725 --> 24:04.115
And, of course, the thing you looked forward to the most at meals was Cush.

24:04.856 --> 24:07.099
And, of course, we had Cush questions.

24:07.467 --> 24:09.549
Well, I say we had cush questions.

24:09.929 --> 24:16.455
We did that for quite a while where we were asked something and we'd have to answer it to be able to qualify to eat dessert.

24:16.936 --> 24:26.685
But after a while they hit upon this idea that each one of us freshmen was supposed to bring a different new fact to the table at every meal.

24:26.845 --> 24:31.530
This was three times a day, seven days a week for a semester or two.

24:32.831 --> 24:34.993
And by the time

24:35.108 --> 24:40.814
you know, a month or so had gone by, we'd run through an awful lot of basic facts about A&M to tell to get our cush.

24:41.114 --> 24:42.696
All right, these were facts about A&M.

24:42.736 --> 24:44.097
About A&M.

24:44.117 --> 24:46.680
Mostly out of the campusology book or other places.

24:47.401 --> 24:58.832
And I was real proud one day because I had just been over to visit Jay Gordon Gay at the YMCA, and he told me about A&M getting, I think, its first Fulbright Scholar.

24:59.553 --> 25:01.555
And that was my fact for the evening.

25:02.075 --> 25:09.664
But we covered an awful lot of history about this place, and that's probably why I'm so ingrained with what has gone on at A&M.

25:09.684 --> 25:12.448
Did anybody ever make up one successfully?

25:13.469 --> 25:14.410
A non-existent?

25:14.430 --> 25:18.896
I'm sure there were some that were questionable, but I don't think anybody ever caught them on it.

25:19.617 --> 25:21.179
Let's back up to Cush questions.

25:21.840 --> 25:25.124
Can you share as many Cush questions as you can remember?

25:26.265 --> 25:28.588
Well, they'd ask you things like, where's the left hand?

25:29.733 --> 25:30.794
What's the correct answer?

25:30.954 --> 25:38.943
Well, right north of the main drill field, the Simpson drill field now, there's a little water faucet sitting beside the sidewalk.

25:39.884 --> 25:45.550
And for some reason or other, the handle on that water faucet has to turn backwards from most other faucets.

25:46.191 --> 25:52.057
So they had embedded a little metal plate in the ground right next to that water faucet that said left hand.

25:53.018 --> 25:54.379
And we had to know where that was.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.582
Or the stairs that go to nowhere.

25:57.403 --> 25:58.744
Over in Bagley Hall,

25:59.247 --> 26:08.397
At some point in time, they had closed up the top of the main staircase and just closed it with a wall to, I guess, make a larger room out of that top floor.

26:09.158 --> 26:12.702
And so we had to find the stairs that went to nowhere.

26:13.382 --> 26:16.746
And if you kept walking up the stairs, you just ran into the wall.

26:17.947 --> 26:20.931
Oh, gosh, there were all sorts of questions.

26:22.893 --> 26:25.035
Were there some for which there was no answer?

26:25.741 --> 26:26.842
Oh, I'm sure there were.

26:26.882 --> 26:30.866
Because I heard one the other day, how many stars are there in the Texas flag?

26:32.207 --> 26:35.510
And if you answer one... One, they'll tell you it's two, one on each side.

26:35.571 --> 26:37.653
Yes, they pull those things on us.

26:38.393 --> 26:41.877
And of course, we had to learn how many stars there were in the Aggie ring.

26:41.917 --> 26:52.187
At one time, they asked us how many dimples there were on the bottom, which are supposed to represent the rear end of the people over at the University of Texas.

26:52.807 --> 26:53.588
But...

26:53.956 --> 26:56.879
Of course, that changed depending on how long somebody had had their ring.

26:56.899 --> 27:00.883
If it was new, it probably was a totally different number than if they'd worn in a little while.

27:03.725 --> 27:11.673
All right, so that the evening meal, was it normally the evening meal where the cush questions and the facts were shared?

27:11.853 --> 27:17.719
Usually, because in the morning and at noon, you had classes to get to, and they didn't have a lot of time to waste.

27:18.179 --> 27:21.162
We were in and out of there pretty fast for those two meals.

27:21.142 --> 27:33.793
As you look back on the experiences of that first fall, did that help to kind of broaden a young freshman's outlook on life?

27:35.635 --> 27:41.841
Well, after I got my first grades, it broadened my impression a great deal about what was required academically to be up here.

27:42.081 --> 27:48.887
And we kind of had a saying back then that anybody could get in A&M, but you had to work to stay there.

27:49.475 --> 27:51.018
And it was true.

27:51.198 --> 27:54.164
I mean, they didn't let you slide by in any area.

27:54.745 --> 27:59.313
Even the geology course I took once, it was supposed to be a grade point course.

28:00.495 --> 28:02.980
It became a non-grade point course the year I took it.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.989
I got a lot of advice, which didn't turn out to help much.

28:08.490 --> 28:08.971
Let's see.

28:09.893 --> 28:13.339
Don't want to pass up the food nicknames.

28:13.454 --> 28:14.075
Oh, yeah.

28:14.095 --> 28:19.826
Well, you know, bread was deal, like you're dealing cards.

28:22.271 --> 28:27.461
Mustard, which you didn't like to say with guests at the table, was called baby.

28:28.603 --> 28:35.496
And ketchup was after birth, or stewed tomatoes, really.

28:35.662 --> 28:37.725
And let's see.

28:38.205 --> 28:38.526
Milk.

28:39.166 --> 28:40.528
Milk was a cow.

28:41.249 --> 28:43.151
And water was sky.

28:44.113 --> 28:44.593
Tea.

28:44.974 --> 28:45.334
Tea.

28:46.996 --> 28:47.617
Was that horse?

28:48.598 --> 28:49.319
It may have been.

28:49.960 --> 28:50.641
I'm not sure.

28:51.442 --> 28:51.943
I have to go back.

28:51.963 --> 28:52.463
Beans.

28:53.384 --> 28:54.526
Beans were artillery.

28:56.368 --> 28:56.669
Meat.

28:57.289 --> 28:59.412
Meat was bull neck.

28:59.472 --> 29:00.994
What about...

29:01.362 --> 29:02.864
other than beef or ham?

29:02.964 --> 29:04.486
They were still called bull neck.

29:04.866 --> 29:05.106
Okay.

29:05.226 --> 29:06.107
Was there one for fish?

29:08.410 --> 29:09.852
I think it was still bull.

29:10.012 --> 29:14.077
Anything that was your meat dish for the meal was bull neck.

29:14.177 --> 29:14.958
Let's see, potatoes?

29:16.359 --> 29:17.801
They were spuds, of course.

29:17.821 --> 29:18.982
Okay.

29:19.523 --> 29:20.063
Greens?

29:21.085 --> 29:22.226
Lemon was sour.

29:22.726 --> 29:23.307
Greens.

29:24.689 --> 29:25.910
I can't remember that one.

29:27.091 --> 29:27.432
I see.

29:27.452 --> 29:28.413
Butter.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.116
Butter.

29:34.184 --> 29:36.770
Well, I remember that cottage cheese was duck butter.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.120
Butter, what did we call butter?

29:42.242 --> 29:43.645
It just won't come to me right now.

29:44.648 --> 29:51.884
I've heard a few stories about a youngster going home, maybe Thanksgiving, the first fall, and forgetting.

29:52.706 --> 29:53.728
Did that happen to you?

29:54.181 --> 29:56.384
I don't recall it happening to me.

29:56.504 --> 30:02.010
I'm sure my brother probably joked and told me that I better watch my language while I was eating at home.

30:02.311 --> 30:05.435
But no, I don't think I slipped up on that.

30:06.436 --> 30:16.628
As you and your buddies those first semesters were eating at the table, was there conversation involving everybody?

30:18.683 --> 30:20.085
Or did you just sit there and eat?

30:20.606 --> 30:24.853
As we had been there longer, things got more relaxed.

30:25.414 --> 30:31.744
But most of the time, we were expected to sit there, ramrod straight in our chairs and eat our meal.

30:32.305 --> 30:35.791
And we weren't even supposed to turn our heads to the left or right.

30:35.831 --> 30:39.958
I mean, if you were passing something, you did it out of the corner of your eye to someone.

30:40.198 --> 30:41.400
And...

30:42.022 --> 30:57.881
Of course, one guy at each table was at a certain corner of the table was declared the hot corner, and it was his responsibility to make sure that if any of the bowls on the table got empty or anything, that he got the waiter's attention and got him over there to get him a new supply.

30:58.982 --> 31:05.149
And talking about Cush a while ago, we had Cush hounds.

31:06.230 --> 31:11.016
Well, meal hounds were people who just stayed after everybody else finished eating and went around.
