00:01.583 --> 00:13.701
After going to the pool in New York City, I was 
transferred to Baltimore to work there out of the

00:01.583 --> 00:13.701
headquarters of the Third Service Command. 
There, of course, the veterinarians went into the

00:14.943 --> 00:30.105
packing houses and inspected all of the meat 
products and anything that the packing houses

00:14.943 --> 00:30.105
produced that they sold to the Army had to be 
inspected. not only for quality, but for quantity

00:31.486 --> 00:35.611
control. If they hadn't had someone there 
controlling the quality of the products, we would

00:35.771 --> 00:52.851
be paying, the taxpayers would be paying for water 
and fat in the canned meats, and the frankfurters

00:35.771 --> 00:52.851
and bologna. Everything had to be sampled at 
random. to be sure that we didn't get too much fat,

00:57.541 --> 01:09.155
too much water in the products, as well as for 
quantity and quality control. That, of course,

01:10.617 --> 01:15.383
was the thing that we did in many assignments. I, of 
course, was able to attend a school in Chicago.

01:20.929 --> 01:24.814
They called it the Quartermaster Depot where we 
were assigned, and we went to school there two

01:25.148 --> 01:32.337
months and learned how to do these inspections. 
Also, of course, I was assigned, the nicest

01:33.639 --> 01:45.194
assignment that I received was going down to Fort 
Myer, Virginia, where we had a hospital for

01:33.639 --> 01:45.194
animals. We treated the horses that are used there 
for pulling the caissons that were used when the

01:55.000 --> 01:59.786
presidents and other dignitaries had their 
funerals. And these caissons, of course, were

01:59.906 --> 02:08.876
pulling the coffins to the Arlington Cemetery. 
Arlington National Cemetery? Right. Arlington

02:10.918 --> 02:14.382
National Cemetery was adjacent to Fort Myer, 
Virginia. And that's the reason the clinic was

02:15.103 --> 02:20.890
there at Fort Myer. And I also, one morning, got to 
meet Mrs. Eisenhower because she and the General

02:21.342 --> 02:29.494
Eisenhower were stationed there. She brought her 
little Scottish terriers out, and we boarded them

02:30.355 --> 02:39.889
and treated them with vaccinations. It was a post 
where General Hap Arnold, General Marshall, and

02:44.731 --> 02:48.841
several other generals were there over the period 
of time that I was there. And I lived in the bachelor

02:49.643 --> 02:57.643
officer's quarters, had to wear a number one 
uniform, and we never knew who would be in the same

02:58.096 --> 02:59.457
room with us. So we had to be prepared to salute a 
general just any day while we were stationed at

02:59.618 --> 03:05.323
Fort Myer. It was the most interesting assignment 
that I had. Well, while you were in the armed

03:08.647 --> 03:23.362
services, as the war was drawing to a close in the 
mid to latter part of the 40s, what were you

03:08.647 --> 03:23.362
thinking about for the future now that you were a 
doctor of veterinary medicine? Did you want to

03:23.622 --> 03:25.003
come back to Texas? What did you have in mind then? 
After I left Fort Myer, Virginia, I was sent to New

03:27.357 --> 03:33.768
York City in a pool. And of course, while I was 
there, I again had to do some inspection of food in

03:35.150 --> 03:42.282
the packing house. But I wrote to Henderson, 
Texas, to see if they needed a veterinarian. I was

03:47.791 --> 03:51.677
looking at the map of East Texas, and I saw the 
beautiful traffic circle. And I thought, well,

03:52.383 --> 03:58.269
that highway at least has a good highway system. I 
wrote the Chamber of Commerce and asked them if

03:58.289 --> 04:01.992
they needed a veterinarian. And they wrote me and 
replied that yes, they needed a young

04:02.833 --> 04:07.818
veterinarian. They had one older man who was 
semi-retired, Dr. Ken Deason. So I knew before I

04:13.183 --> 04:19.369
left New York, I was interested in Henderson. But I 
had only been at home in Gilmer about three days

04:20.193 --> 04:31.724
when I received an emergency call to go to Mount 
Pleasant in Titus County and help vaccinate all

04:20.193 --> 04:31.724
the cattle in the county against anthrax. It had 
become an epidemic. So I went up there and I helped

04:35.127 --> 04:40.112
Dr. Norman Ralston for one month. I was home only 
three or four days and I got a call from Shreveport.

04:45.137 --> 04:48.621
So Dr. Young in Shreveport, A.V. Young out at Dixie 
Garden, clinic needed a young veterinarian. So I

04:54.306 --> 04:57.872
decided, well, it's a good chance to get an 
internship. After being in the army for three

04:58.933 --> 05:03.380
years, I needed an internship. So I went to 
Shreveport, started working for $175 a month. as a

05:10.109 --> 05:11.370
young veterinarian. When was this, in about 46 or 
45? That was in 46. 46. So after staying there about

05:16.015 --> 05:24.544
10 or 11 months, Dr. Young says, well, if you stay 
over here, you're going to have to take the

05:16.015 --> 05:24.544
Louisiana State Board. So I told him, well, since I 
plan to live in East Texas the rest of most of my

05:25.265 --> 05:32.772
life, I'll just move to Henderson. So I wrote to 
Chamber of Commerce or called them, And they said,

05:37.447 --> 05:39.870
oh, yes, we still need a veterinarian. So I came and 
visited the Chamber of Commerce, lived in the old

05:41.011 --> 05:47.639
Randolph Hotel for two or three days. And the 
chamber manager carried me out to Mr. Gordon

05:48.821 --> 05:55.629
Brown's store and introduced me to Gordon Brown. 
And I rented the two rooms on the north side of his

05:56.630 --> 06:06.863
filling station and grocery store and stayed in 
that neighborhood for several years. And after I

06:07.720 --> 06:23.623
could practice there, and of course we were only 
charging about $2 for a rabies vaccine and $3 or $4

06:07.720 --> 06:23.623
for the other distemper, hepatitis vaccine. We 
treated, mainly we treated cattle. 90% of the

06:28.650 --> 06:31.354
practice was cattle. People couldn't afford to 
treat their pets, evidently. And they didn't know

06:35.700 --> 06:37.322
very much about having services available for 
pets. They did the best they could with home

06:42.595 --> 06:44.697
remedies. So most of your practice was on cattle at 
that time? Cattle. I would say 85 to 90 percent

06:48.121 --> 06:50.583
cattle. We had cattle all over the city. What types 
of cattle? 40 or 50 milk cows. Okay. Out in the oil

06:57.050 --> 07:04.238
field, cattle were running open range through the 
oil field in many places. but many of those people

07:04.859 --> 07:17.013
who were working for the oil companies had milk 
cows, and we had dairies at that time, 30 to 30,

07:04.859 --> 07:17.013
maybe 36 at least. I believe Mr. Felix Burton told 
me there were 36 dairies here in the late 40s. I

07:23.982 --> 07:26.284
remember five or six in Brockville. We made a 
living treating cattle, and it was a hard way to

07:27.646 --> 07:32.031
make a living. But our expenses weren't great. Mr. 
Gordon Brown only charged me a small 27 and a half

07:36.621 --> 07:47.471
was my overhead for rent, and he answered my 
telephone. And of course, we could get by. We did

07:53.036 --> 07:57.000
very little pet work. When we started spaying 
dogs, we only charged $10. You could get dogs

07:59.962 --> 08:02.845
spayed for $10, most anywhere. I had one man who was 
a truck driver, brought two dogs in. He said, what

08:08.374 --> 08:11.479
will you charge me if I have two spade at one time? 
And I said, about $9 each. He says, well, I can take

08:13.562 --> 08:20.711
them to a veterinarian over near Buckner's 
Orphanage Home in Dallas, get them done for $7. So

08:21.993 --> 08:30.485
that, you see, was a different fee schedule from 
what veterinarians were able to charge the last

08:21.993 --> 08:30.485
few years. Yeah, sounds like it. Well, where did 
you, where were your offices located? You said you

08:36.064 --> 08:40.310
were in Gordon Brown's store, off of his store in a 
little room. Where did you move around during the

08:40.690 --> 08:42.272
years? Well, I stayed there until I built my new 
clinic out near the traffic circle, the one that

08:43.214 --> 08:50.544
Dr. Rumbo now owns. Right. What year was that? I 
think it was 1959. 1959. Okay. Well, how did your

08:57.489 --> 09:00.314
practice grow over the years? When did you start 
treating, you know, pets and things like that?

09:05.201 --> 09:07.665
Well, the practice gradually grew. And, of 
course, after building the clinic, I could see

09:07.705 --> 09:22.787
that I couldn't do justice to both small animals 
and large animals without having some help. So I

09:22.807 --> 09:24.790
hired Dr. Norman Ralston, of course, came and 
practiced with me for a while. And also Dr. Lovick

09:32.286 --> 09:36.611
worked with me for a while. And Dr. Rumbo was hired 
in 1970. And then later we hired Dr. Corley. There

09:46.964 --> 09:48.666
were three of us there for a while. And, of course, 
we also had work to do with testing all the cattle.

09:55.651 --> 10:24.628
in russ county for brucellosis that was the bangs 
disease program when every cow in the county had to

09:55.651 --> 10:24.628
be tested and jack rayford used to bring his truck 
out every morning and he and i would go out and test

09:55.651 --> 10:24.628
two or three herds of cattle in the time that all the 
cows had to be tested we'd schedule two or three

09:55.651 --> 10:24.628
herds a day but at that time i still had to come back 
and get caught up at the clinic Well, our guest this

10:25.317 --> 10:35.871
morning, let me take a break right here and tell 
you, is Dr. Hugh M. Phillips, doctor of veterinary

10:25.317 --> 10:35.871
medicine who's retired here of Henderson and Russ 
County. He practiced veterinary medicine here in

10:35.891 --> 10:39.576
Henderson for 38 years. His practice started, I 
believe, in September of 1947. He retired in 1985.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.427
And of course, if you've been in Henderson et al. 
Before those years, you've heard of Dr. Hugh M.

10:48.869 --> 10:54.377
Phillips, doctor of veterinary medicine. We're 
talking about the history of veterinary medicine

10:54.397 --> 11:04.551
in Texas, and now we're down to the specifics of his 
career and also what's going to be going on here in

10:54.397 --> 11:04.551
Russ County. Let's see, were you a single man when 
you moved here in 1947? You might better bring us up

11:09.497 --> 11:11.981
to date on the important stuff here. Yeah, I was 
very single. Okay. I met my wife here in 1947 at

11:15.892 --> 11:34.331
church, and of course I was able to have a little 
time, you know, to devote to courting, but not

11:15.892 --> 11:34.331
much. So it took me a while to decide that perhaps I 
might be old enough to get married. So finally we

11:42.500 --> 11:45.763
became engaged. And married in 49. 1949. 1949,

11:47.693 --> 11:52.021
right. And had two daughters, of course, Melanie 
Taylor and Sarah Ann Cobb are our two daughters.

12:01.499 --> 12:03.062
Let's don't forget the grandkids now. And, of 
course, we have three grandchildren, Blake

12:03.082 --> 12:08.933
Taylor and Adam Taylor. and Miss Stephanie Carr 
down in Bryan, Texas. Okay. We definitely had to

12:14.631 --> 12:18.481
get those ladies and the grandkids in this. It 
wouldn't be an interview if we didn't. But what I

12:21.348 --> 12:26.460
want to get to now is some of the more interesting 
cases you've seen here in Russ County. Now, you

12:26.480 --> 12:27.563
worked with... A lot of people in Russell County, 
as you said, you were a people person. You worked

12:30.647 --> 12:33.651
with the farmers and the ranchers and the county 
agents. You've worked with several county agents

12:33.671 --> 12:39.379
over the years, including Mr. Felix Burton, 
you've named earlier. Let's just go back and kind

12:40.340 --> 12:49.572
of reminisce about some of these different 
diseases you've seen, maybe some unusual things

12:40.340 --> 12:49.572
and problems that you faced and how you overcame 
them. Well, one of the most unusual things that we

12:54.728 --> 13:03.637
were seeing in cattle when I first came here in 47 
was being called X disease because we didn't know

12:54.728 --> 13:03.637
what else to call it. The first case that I saw was 
north of Laneville on a farm of Jack Mosley in 1947,

13:04.618 --> 13:16.690
my first year in practice in Russ County. Later it 
was seen in caves at the John R. Alford Dairy out on

13:16.730 --> 13:22.356
the Overton Highway. when approximately 12 or 15 
of his calves were sick and dying with this strange

13:23.416 --> 13:30.447
disease. It was also diagnosed on a farm owned by 
Major Hall, east of Henderson. This disease was

13:37.337 --> 13:43.626
not described in the textbook and had never been 
seen before by veterinarians or cattlemen.

13:44.267 --> 13:50.757
Symptoms seen in this condition were the loss of 
hair and wrinkling of the skin on their necks, in

13:51.192 --> 13:54.616
the thoracic area of their chest. Tearing was very 
profuse, with the tears dripping from their chins

13:55.517 --> 14:01.324
of the calves. Ulcers were present in the mouth and 
the stomach, along with severe diarrhea in some

14:01.604 --> 14:07.571
cases. At that time, I consulted A&M College, and 
Dr. Hubert Smith was sent to help with the

14:08.753 --> 14:19.005
observation and diagnosis of these strange 
diseases. Soon after Dr. Smith spent the day here

14:20.150 --> 14:37.695
visiting these herds of sick animals, he wrote me 
that the condition had been diagnosed as

14:20.150 --> 14:37.695
hyperkeratitis due to cattle licking axle grease 
and other farm lubricants. It was also seen where

14:37.715 --> 14:44.385
newly treated creosoted timbers were being used 
in barnyards. The offending chemical was

14:44.956 --> 14:51.566
chlorinated hydrocarbons used as preservatives 
in farm lubricants. Once the cause was known, the

14:51.586 --> 14:58.516
government outlawed the use of these 
preservatives and the disease disappeared.

15:00.499 --> 15:06.087
Before they learned what it was, at least a half a 
million cattle were lost. in the southern states.

15:07.519 --> 15:21.912
My goodness, just from licking these farm 
lubricants off of... And it was also getting into

15:07.519 --> 15:21.912
the cubes, the cattle feed, going through the 
machinery, the cube that the cattle were fed had

15:07.519 --> 15:21.912
contained some of that chemical. Another very 
unusual condition that we saw down on the farm of

15:23.173 --> 15:30.239
Edgar Lee Keeling. Mr. Keeling lived east of 
Brockville there on Clayton Highway. He was

15:36.222 --> 15:43.933
feeding some sweet potatoes to two herds of cattle 
in two different pastures because the potatoes

15:36.222 --> 15:43.933
had rotten spots on them. After the third or fourth 
feeding of the sweet potatoes, the cattle began to

15:44.735 --> 15:51.805
get sick because they couldn't breathe. They had 
this condition which, of course, was due to the

15:57.637 --> 16:11.875
fungus growing on the potato called pulmonary 
adenomatosis, a rare disease that can happen if

15:57.637 --> 16:11.875
the potatoes are beginning to rot. This was only 
seen once in Russ County, but he lost

16:11.895 --> 16:21.687
approximately 60 head of cattle that he fed these 
potatoes. There was another real unusual thing

16:21.937 --> 16:24.640
that took place. White muscle disease was the 
diagnosis. One year during the mid-50s, a Russ

16:29.124 --> 16:37.692
County area had an early freeze causing many 
acorns to fall from the trees at one time. At this

16:38.393 --> 16:43.598
time, several dozen cattlemen found from two to 
six cows down and unable to walk. These downer cows

16:44.399 --> 16:50.745
were all passing coffee-colored urine and lived 
only three or four days. They all died regardless

16:51.113 --> 16:54.056
of what you treated them with. Approximately 12 
East Texas veterinarians met in Nacogdoches and

16:55.178 --> 17:06.551
came to the conclusion that these cattle were 
probably suffering from the tannic acid poison

16:55.178 --> 17:06.551
due to the acorns. One or two weeks later, after our 
meeting in Nacogdoches, this condition was

17:08.313 --> 17:20.648
diagnosed by an A&M veterinarian as white muscle 
disease due to the deficiency of vitamin E during

17:21.117 --> 17:50.702
the dry period of summer and fall I have recently 
learned however that this unusual condition seen

17:21.117 --> 17:50.702
only one year was more likely caused by the cattle 
eating the poison weed that is commonly referred

17:21.117 --> 17:50.702
to as coffee beans which is very toxic after the 
early freeze in the fall also a very interesting

17:21.117 --> 17:50.702
thing that happened to us was that cattle were 
dying Suddenly, in the Harmony Hill community

17:51.037 --> 17:58.624
south of Tatum, several family milk cows died in 
one neighborhood. This alarmed Commissioner

17:58.684 --> 18:01.947
R.E. Doc Young, who consulted me. The specimens 
taken from the dead animal that we did the

18:06.791 --> 18:16.079
postmortem on were sent to diagnostic 
laboratories at A&M in Austin. The diagnosis

18:17.160 --> 18:19.542
confirmed that the cattle were dying with 
anthrax. The County Agent Felix Burton, the

18:22.608 --> 18:37.727
Commissioner's Court, and Dr. Richard Winters, a 
veterinarian with the State Health Department,

18:22.608 --> 18:37.727
convened, and we decided to quietly vaccinate all 
adjacent premises against the disease. The news

18:38.808 --> 18:48.280
of this epidemic was not released to the media in 
order to keep the cattle traders from

18:38.808 --> 18:48.280
unofficially boycotting Russ County cattle. A 
few years later, one cow died suddenly at the

18:49.795 --> 18:56.862
Dulaney Ranch between Henderson and Laneville. 
This animal had classical post-mortem symptoms

18:56.882 --> 19:00.887
of anthrax. I noticed the cow was bleeding from all 
of her external openings. Therefore, I suspected

19:07.694 --> 19:10.276
anthrax. I sent specimens to the laboratory, and 
they confirmed that this cow died with anthrax. We

19:17.600 --> 19:25.902
still don't know where the disease came from 
because we hadn't ever had any anthrax in that part

19:17.600 --> 19:25.902
of the county. But it was confirmed to be anthrax. 
We again met with Mr. Burton and commissioners

19:29.772 --> 19:38.803
court and the state veterinarian and decided to do 
the same thing. We vaccinated all the adjacent

19:38.883 --> 19:47.873
premises and stopped that epidemic before it got 
into the newspaper and the radio and the life

19:38.883 --> 19:47.873
magazine. They had it in the life magazine when 
they had an outbreak in Southern Oklahoma a few

19:48.594 --> 19:57.585
years earlier and almost ruined the cattle 
industry in that area. But all the anthrax

19:58.477 --> 20:05.628
epidemics that did occur were taken care of 
quickly and isolated in different parts of the

19:58.477 --> 20:05.628
county. In this county, we've only had cattle die 
in two different places, and we only lost about

20:05.709 --> 20:20.773
eight or ten cattle in the first epidemic before 
vaccination started, and I only lost one cow on the

20:05.709 --> 20:20.773
Dulaney Ranch. Okay. Okay. I have some other 
interesting things if you have time. Sure. Let's

20:27.513 --> 20:28.335
go ahead. We're making history here today. We've 
got you here at the radio station. By the way, our

20:31.521 --> 20:36.511
guest is Dr. Hugh M. Phillips, retired doctor of 
veterinary medicine. He practiced 38 years here

20:36.551 --> 20:40.279
in Russ County in Henderson. and of course retired 
in 1985, and he and his other cohorts, Texas A&M and

20:40.259 --> 21:01.470
veterinarians, are compiling a book that's going 
to be coming out called The History of Veterinary

20:40.259 --> 21:01.470
Medicine in Texas, and we've covered a lot of the 
history this morning, and we're down to the

20:40.259 --> 21:01.470
specifics in Russ County and what you've seen as a 
vet here in Henderson. What are some of the other

21:02.051 --> 21:04.034
things that you've seen? Well, some of the most 
perplexing things that I saw was lead poisoning

21:09.993 --> 21:13.798
and arsenic poisoning in cattle. Before the Russ 
County farmers quit raising cotton, arsenic was

21:14.899 --> 21:21.588
used to poison insects on the cotton. The leftover 
arsenic was not always easy to, easy or safely

21:22.289 --> 21:30.459
stored or destroyed. People still don't know what 
to do with several pounds of arsenic. One rancher,

21:37.288 --> 21:39.831
Ray Calvert, who had moved here and had the Santa 
Gertrudis trading business. He sent cattle all

21:45.004 --> 21:47.506
over the world. I remember doing some work for Ray 
Cowart and sending some cattle to Vietnam before

21:47.586 --> 21:54.432
the war with Vietnam. He had leased a pasture from 
Otis Wiley down at Laneville. He had 50 head of

22:02.439 --> 22:05.982
valuable Santa Gertrudis cattle. One week, these 
cattle broke into the barn And they found, just by

22:10.945 --> 22:21.176
milling around in that barn, they found arsenic 
that had been stored there in a five gallon milk

22:10.945 --> 22:21.176
can. And the bottom had rusted out of this can. The 
cattle knocked the can over and there must have

22:25.261 --> 22:31.728
been 30 or 40 pounds of arsenic in the can. All of 
those cattle had licked on that arsenic for two or

22:32.769 --> 22:37.895
three days because it was salty tasting. They all 
started dying. We called A&M College to see if

22:40.898 --> 22:53.440
there was any treatment they would recommend that 
was new, and I was told that there was nothing you

22:40.898 --> 22:53.440
could do if they had eaten arsenic and you hadn't 
started your treatment the first day. So he lost at

22:55.524 --> 23:02.696
least 50 head of valuable Santa Catruta's cattle 
from the arsenic that they consumed. Ralph

23:03.979 --> 23:05.421
Ballinger, who lived just north of Henderson, 
lost several large hogs when they rooted up a can of

23:06.194 --> 23:16.228
arsenic that had been buried in the barnyard by his 
father. The hogs, of course, normally get out and

23:18.110 --> 23:25.640
start rooting around in the soil, and they found 
that arsenic. And he, of course, lost all of his big

23:26.361 --> 23:31.408
fat hogs that he planned to kill. Cattlemen in the 
Gaston and Joinerville area lost cattle one year

23:31.996 --> 23:42.289
when one oil well servicing company used a treater 
solution in cleaning some of the old oil wells.

23:43.330 --> 23:44.632
Arsenic was suspected. Some of this oil around the 
wells was tested and found to contain arsenic.

23:50.259 --> 23:58.450
These few cattle were lost, but after the company 
learned about the cattle dying, they paid for the

23:50.259 --> 23:58.450
cattle and no more losses occurred. Lead 
poisoning cattle was seen on several occasions

24:02.202 --> 24:10.990
when young cattle would lick or drink water from 
lead paint buckets that were left around

24:02.202 --> 24:10.990
barnyards by careless owners. Most people have 
now learned to be more careful with their paint

24:11.851 --> 24:15.714
buckets. Also,

24:15.754 --> 24:31.568
a very interesting epidemic was seen in 1951 to 
1953 when Russ County and other adjacent counties

24:15.754 --> 24:31.568
suffered a rabies epidemic in foxes, dogs, and 
cattle. Foxes were chasing cattlemen up trees

24:32.071 --> 24:36.936
when they would go to feed their cattle. Rabies in 
cattle and dogs was hard to diagnose clinically.

24:42.082 --> 24:51.992
Some had only the dumb rabies symptoms with 
paralysis of the lower jaw, while others would be

24:42.082 --> 24:51.992
violent and vicious. Many cattle owners were 
exposed and had to be treated with the Pasteur

24:57.569 --> 24:59.631
treatment, it's called. We're talking about 
rabies now. Right. Was there a specific time

25:02.215 --> 25:06.520
period that this was a big problem? It was in the 
early 50s in this county. You said foxes and dogs

25:10.124 --> 25:12.687
and cattle now. I don't see too many foxes now. I 
know that there are, but there used to be a lot more,

25:15.310 --> 25:19.335
I guess. In the early 50s, we had a lot of foxes and we 
had a lot of fox hunters. Now we don't have either.

25:27.438 --> 25:34.585
And the reason is because the state health 
department was called in to talk to the cattlemen

25:27.438 --> 25:34.585
and the dog owners. We met in the district 
courtroom and authorities decided to warn the dog

25:34.605 --> 25:46.936
owners to confine their dogs while strychnine was 
used to poison the foxes, the coyotes, and stray

25:34.605 --> 25:46.936
dogs. This procedure was very unpopular with the 
fox hunters, but the rabies epidemic was brought

25:47.036 --> 25:54.323
under control shortly after the program was 
finished. The fox population in Russ County never

25:59.118 --> 26:03.062
has replenished. Right. Okay, now we hear of 
skunks nowadays. They're fairly plentiful, not

26:08.107 --> 26:17.977
as many as you see in other parts of Texas, but 
they're one of the animals that spread rabies too.

26:17.997 --> 26:21.500
What other animals are carriers here in the East 
Texas area? Any warm-blooded animal. can have

26:23.429 --> 26:24.751
rabies. Before I moved to Henderson, a man out in 
the Churchill area named Poole, I don't think he

26:25.312 --> 26:45.239
was closely related to the other Poole family in 
this county, but he had killed a squirrel, and some

26:25.312 --> 26:45.239
of his family remembered that this squirrel bit 
him, and he died with rabies. And of course, any

26:46.521 --> 26:52.609
warm-blooded animal, we have seen a lot of rabid 
skunks in the county, but For some reason, even

26:53.973 --> 27:02.581
though we find rabid skunks often, we've been 
lucky and haven't had too many rabid animals.

27:02.781 --> 27:06.444
We've had a few rabid cats and a few rabid dogs. But 
with the vaccination procedure that most people

27:07.005 --> 27:14.292
are doing on their pets, rabies has been brought 
under control. And there's two types of rabies,

27:14.712 --> 27:16.574
aren't there? Yes. Can you explain the two and the 
different symptoms? That's what makes it so

27:19.456 --> 27:21.398
confusing. The first time I saw a rabid animal was 
when I was about 8 or 10 years old. And I had a, well,

27:27.652 --> 27:33.760
my family had a bird dog, pointer. Everybody in 
east part of Gilmer knew about old Rap because he

27:35.082 --> 27:43.813
was such a fine bird dog. He came home one day with 
the paralysis of his lower jaw and his tongue

27:44.975 --> 27:50.963
hanging out of his mouth. And I consulted my 
neighbor, my father, and they consulted the

27:52.816 --> 28:03.714
pharmacist who was helping people make 
diagnosis. And most all of the people that saw the

28:04.274 --> 28:11.466
dog thought he had sore mouth, which was a common 
disease among dogs.
