WEBVTT

00:02.056 --> 00:05.221
How did you identify those specific individuals?

00:05.762 --> 00:06.583
Oh, look at that.

00:06.603 --> 00:09.407
Now, do you want another, this is another story, too.

00:10.469 --> 00:14.856
Remember the fellow who was in charge of the registrar's office, Lloyd Heaton, was it?

00:14.876 --> 00:16.598
Mm-hmm.

00:16.618 --> 00:27.996
Heaton, as an old-time Aggie, couldn't understand why economics, anything in the social sciences, anything in the arts, or what have you, could be really important.

00:28.297 --> 00:34.666
Engineering, mathematics, that was the name of the game with Lloyd Heaton.

00:34.686 --> 00:38.692
And he had an unbelievable impact on approving of courses.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.454
Remember this, Hansel?

00:40.474 --> 00:45.401
Oh, I remember the battles that I had with Lloyd and the games I did play with him.

00:46.683 --> 00:49.066
Sometime I'm going to write a little book, the games I played.

00:51.109 --> 00:53.933
Anyway, I learned quickly with Lloyd Heaton

00:55.178 --> 01:05.779
and hence the background of A&M, its engineering background, its agricultural to some extent, that if we're going to make economics critical,

01:07.227 --> 01:12.433
I've got to indicate how mathematically the prime economists are.

01:12.813 --> 01:21.282
I mean, we were becoming more and more mathematically oriented from about the late 50s on.

01:21.402 --> 01:30.552
In fact, Haskell, when I took my doctorate, as I mentioned, I started right after the war and finished in 51,

01:30.532 --> 01:41.904
I had to pass two language exams, one which is almost automatic because of military background in French, other was German, and the German boys, you talk of luck.

01:41.924 --> 01:49.932
If you want me to backtrack on luck on German, oh gosh, I've got so many stories, I could keep you here until midnight.

01:49.952 --> 01:52.374
And I mean just the good Lord's blessings.

01:53.515 --> 01:56.218
I'll backtrack quickly on this one.

01:56.840 --> 02:02.685
So you understand why I was successful as an economist, not brilliance, but by luck.

02:04.011 --> 02:07.204
A little church.

02:07.707 --> 02:22.491
Auburn, Alabama, Lutheran Church, we invited a German to come over to our church and spend time with us, study at Auburn, and learn what America was like.

02:22.531 --> 02:27.739
This was in 1948, shortly after the war, two years beyond, two and a half beyond.

02:28.781 --> 02:33.428
This fellow came over, and I met him, and I had to pass my German exam.

02:35.585 --> 02:46.342
I wasn't doing too well learning German, though I did have some time in which I frankly, thank heaven, had some of Mammel's people as PWs under me.

02:48.525 --> 02:49.386
I'm learning German.

02:49.807 --> 02:51.269
I've got this German student.

02:52.131 --> 02:53.593
Our church is paying his way.

02:54.097 --> 02:55.359
I worked out a deal with him.

02:55.420 --> 03:00.610
I said, Mr. Ladd, I'll help you with your economics course.

03:00.630 --> 03:02.854
He's taking it at Auburn.

03:03.696 --> 03:13.455
You help me with translating this book that I got a hold of by August Lerch, The Spatial Economy.

03:13.435 --> 03:25.626
The German writers in economics were fantastic in terms of location economics, which had been my dissertation, and now spatial economics, as they were calling it, but no one else in the world called it that.

03:27.090 --> 03:30.077
And this fellow helped me translate August Lerch's book.

03:30.968 --> 03:32.850
before it had ever been translated.

03:33.211 --> 03:41.842
And to me the greatest mind that I've ever studied directly out of, or indirectly I should say out of, was this book by August Lerch.

03:42.884 --> 03:58.444
It gave me the greatest break in the world because I started publishing articles that no American had read before about a man that no American, other than a handful of those who maybe came over from Europe, were able to read and didn't read much about August Lerch.

03:59.285 --> 04:16.404
To me, besides getting the misdelivered orders during the Korean War, which saved my soul, in fact, or kept me in academia or kept me home, reading and having this German student help me with German.

04:16.584 --> 04:18.746
So I went through the whole book with this boy.

04:18.867 --> 04:22.050
He was fascinated by it as well as I was.

04:22.771 --> 04:25.714
In fact, this economist, August

04:26.048 --> 04:38.326
on page 202 of at least the book that I saw in German was saying, and when we defeat the Soviet Union we will carve them up in this network of hexagons which I have described over the last five chapters or whatever.

04:39.548 --> 04:51.465
In other words, the book was being dedicated to Adolf as when we win the war, here's the way we're going to create a wonderful economy out of that vast Union called the Soviet Union.

04:51.985 --> 04:59.636
So here I've got a head start on virtually every American economist and English economist by having read the entirety.

05:00.437 --> 05:11.253
I read the entirety because I got fascinated with it and I had this German student who was equally fascinated and also taking economics and enjoying his stay in the United States.

05:11.954 --> 05:14.398
It led me into a series of articles.

05:14.665 --> 05:16.293
at a journal, but guess what?

05:16.473 --> 05:23.747
The editor was a German, Schwenning, who was so thrilled to find that Americans, and he himself had been German,

05:24.233 --> 05:31.241
that Americans would be reading what German economists had been writing, that I almost had automatic acceptances.

05:31.742 --> 05:34.225
Oh, Haskell, I've been lucky.

05:34.245 --> 05:37.829
I've been so lucky, and the older I get, the more you make me think back of things.

05:38.330 --> 05:39.111
All of this is luck.

05:39.411 --> 05:39.792
All right.

05:39.812 --> 05:47.541
Who helped identify, or did you identify Charlie Ferguson, and who identified the specific individuals?

05:48.753 --> 05:54.824
One of my first good articles in my academic career after the doctorate was with a fellow named Bill Fouts.

05:54.844 --> 05:55.425
Who was Bill?

05:55.505 --> 05:57.329
He was a professor in North Carolina.

05:57.730 --> 06:03.119
So Bill Fouts and I wrote this article together on spatial economics.

06:03.180 --> 06:07.247
Bill was sort of interested in it, but not learned about August Lerch.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.131
And who's his favorite student?

06:09.792 --> 06:11.014
Charles Ferguson.

06:11.753 --> 06:18.681
And I'm up in North Carolina because I mentioned that they wanted me on their faculty and I instead went to Florida State.

06:19.642 --> 06:25.729
Anyway, I'm up there in North Carolina thinking about going to North Carolina, and Ms.

06:25.769 --> 06:36.040
Charles Ferguson walks into Bill Fouts' office, and Bill and I are chatting, and Bill introduces me to the cleverest, brightest PhD candidate he's ever had.

06:37.201 --> 06:45.333
And so I met Charlie Ferguson, and a year or two later I met him at a convention, got to like the man, and ultimately I'm here at A&M.

06:46.195 --> 06:52.504
And Charlie, by this stage of the game, is now a full prophet at Michigan State, so it was a matter of luck.

06:52.524 --> 06:54.668
I knew Charles Ferguson, liked him greatly.

06:54.768 --> 06:58.213
I knew he was basically from Arkansas, a southerner.

06:58.683 --> 07:01.286
And he and I had a nice rapport.

07:01.726 --> 07:03.948
So how did I identify Charlie?

07:04.869 --> 07:07.612
I was lucky I met Charlie through Bill Fouts.

07:07.632 --> 07:09.013
What about Tom Savings?

07:09.033 --> 07:13.297
Tom Savings was a real close friend of Charles Ferguson at Michigan State.

07:13.738 --> 07:16.761
I'd also been a visiting professor in the summertime at Michigan State.

07:17.382 --> 07:22.947
I went up there because one of our kids, our son John, had a chance for the Olympics.

07:22.967 --> 07:25.990
And the coach at Michigan State in swimming

07:25.970 --> 07:31.996
was a prospective Olympic coach on swimming.

07:32.717 --> 07:40.845
So Michigan State had offered me a job in the summertime if I wanted it, and I grabbed it rather than stay in Tallahassee.

07:41.506 --> 07:48.252
And we took our whole family up so that John could swim under the McChesney, and I had arranged for that in taking the job.

07:48.873 --> 07:52.277
And Michigan State being there, who's there?

07:52.537 --> 07:55.740
Charles Fergus, Dom Saving, Bob Lanzelotti.

07:56.058 --> 08:00.003
This leads me to another thought, if I could go on a tangent.

08:01.705 --> 08:04.448
John Mavoni, another fellow who we attracted here.

08:05.609 --> 08:09.174
John and I knew each other at Florida State.

08:09.214 --> 08:21.288
John had just gotten his doctorate out of Duke, a young professor, and I introduced him to Bob Lanzolotti at a party or something like that, and next thing I know, John is up at Michigan State also.

08:22.290 --> 08:26.014
So there was a convention going on in New Orleans

08:26.365 --> 08:44.217
And John's wife lives in New Orleans, and so he used his wife's home to have a party for the Southern Economic Association friends of his, namely guys from Michigan State, and a few others at this party.

08:45.119 --> 08:48.745
And at that party, guess who's there but Charlie Ferguson and Tom Saving.

08:49.450 --> 09:18.360
And as John Allen said it at this roasting, or John Maloney rather said it at the roasting, he said, I had just been told by Bob Lanzalotti, who was at this party, that you're being favorably considered for tenure at Michigan State, and here Mel Greenhead is stealing the two best men we've got, Charles Ferguson and Tom Saving, and by gosh, when I learned what had happened that Mel grabbed him at

09:18.779 --> 09:23.447
the party that I'm throwing at my wife's family home in New Orleans.

09:24.028 --> 09:29.496
Mill has taught those two fellows into visiting at A&M, and by gosh they're going to A&M.

09:30.198 --> 09:31.480
I'm going to lose my tenure.

09:34.645 --> 09:39.453
So I fell into a lot of lucky occasions such as that one.

09:39.953 --> 09:42.778
In what, in those early years,

09:43.096 --> 09:46.081
In what areas of economics was the department?

09:46.522 --> 09:47.744
Oh, I lost you two.

09:48.165 --> 09:51.050
I was on Lloyd Heaton and that.

09:53.915 --> 10:00.126
What happened, when I was able to recruit Bob Baseman, Bob was in econometrics.

10:00.815 --> 10:05.021
And econometrics is a lot of mathematics.

10:05.041 --> 10:14.234
And again, the whole profession, instead of, oh, PhDs in economics, by the end of the 50s, you didn't have to take two languages and pass them anymore.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.979
No such thing as the French-German combination.

10:18.479 --> 10:20.322
You have to pass a mathematics exam.

10:21.424 --> 10:28.273
And typically in rather advanced calculus, including not only differential and ellenical, but even optimal control theory and stuff.

10:28.658 --> 10:31.762
So economists were going more and more towards mathematics.

10:33.103 --> 10:42.535
Of course, here I'm talking in the 60s already, that we're here at A&M, and economists were becoming somewhat erudite in their mathematical backgrounds.

10:43.897 --> 10:46.700
Lloyd Heaton thinks in terms of engineering.

10:46.780 --> 10:50.565
I'm trying to get courses approved, a PhD program, among other things.

10:51.338 --> 11:01.812
I'm running into a blank wall, one that Earl Rutter hadn't paid for me as well as most of them, and these courses were dragging on getting approval.

11:03.334 --> 11:17.633
Part of my deal with Wayne Hall and Earl, and I don't know how much Wayne was involved on the deal, was something like for every five masses candidates that I could bring to the department,

11:18.153 --> 11:38.642
I could hire one junior professor, assistant professor, maybe associate, but basically assistant, for every three PhD candidates, and this is now a little bit after we got the PhD approved out of, I think Jack Williams was involved in Boston, out of every three

11:39.837 --> 11:49.655
PhDs that I could bring in, so I'm recruiting grad students at the same time when I was going around the state giving lectures at even the women's college up in Denton.

11:50.878 --> 11:55.947
Anyway, for about every three PhD candidates I could go after a senior professor.

11:56.728 --> 12:02.419
So we're knocking out, I'm knocking myself out to get major graduate students

12:02.855 --> 12:09.284
And then, as a result, being able to hire top quality young men and older men.

12:09.905 --> 12:15.532
Young men, I guess I'd have to include Phil Graham, though I'm a little upset over some things he's done recently.

12:17.335 --> 12:28.069
Chuck Maurice, Bob Eaklin, many others, and top guys like Fuhrer Bodden, Baseman, Saving, Ferguson, and the like.

12:29.686 --> 12:32.870
Anyway, Lloyd Heaton is a stumbling block.

12:32.970 --> 12:34.773
I'm not getting the courses approved.

12:35.694 --> 12:37.216
So I finally visited with him.

12:37.376 --> 12:41.282
I said, gee whiz, Lloyd, don't you realize what we're doing in economics?

12:41.322 --> 12:43.965
We're converting the old department that you used to know.

12:44.005 --> 12:45.768
This is a mathematical department.

12:46.068 --> 12:48.952
He said, well, what do you mean by this course?

12:48.972 --> 12:51.335
I said, this course in econometrics?

12:51.355 --> 12:52.657
I said, and I tried to explain.

12:53.057 --> 12:55.761
He said, well, why call it econ?

12:55.994 --> 12:57.377
I said, I don't know.

12:57.397 --> 12:58.139
It's just history.

12:58.159 --> 13:00.024
We're used to calling this.

13:00.184 --> 13:01.989
It comes out of the economics department.

13:02.009 --> 13:03.252
We could call it anything else.

13:03.593 --> 13:05.237
He said, I'll call it econometrics.

13:05.257 --> 13:07.502
I said, well, we've got one of these courses.

13:07.763 --> 13:09.367
He said, I mean, label it differently.

13:10.209 --> 13:11.111
Look in the catalog.

13:11.171 --> 13:12.555
I suspect it's still the same.

13:12.775 --> 13:13.918
ECMT.

13:14.911 --> 13:17.475
standing not for econ but for econometrics.

13:18.276 --> 13:24.145
Well if that's all he needed to approve my courses, I said fine, let's call it ECMT.

13:24.706 --> 13:31.637
So I even created other ECMT courses which are more mathematical econ than they are econometrics.

13:32.107 --> 13:37.071
Did you play those games as president?

13:37.091 --> 13:38.032
I bet you did.

13:39.974 --> 13:40.394
Let's see.

13:42.136 --> 13:45.579
You mentioned there was one senior faculty member you went after and didn't get.

13:45.619 --> 13:47.681
All right.

13:47.941 --> 13:53.526
These junior faculty members, how did you find Eakland and Graham and Reese?

13:53.546 --> 13:57.329
Well, Eakland came out of LSU, so I stole after I'd gone there to visit.

13:57.829 --> 14:02.113
I met this young fellow, and he was only getting his doctorate out of there.

14:02.093 --> 14:04.278
So I really did not raid Bill Ross.

14:04.298 --> 14:05.621
That would be dirty as could be.

14:05.701 --> 14:09.129
I don't mind raiding at John Mulroney's party.

14:09.290 --> 14:10.813
That was fair game, you know.

14:12.557 --> 14:19.714
But no, I didn't raid LSU, but they were turning out this Bob Eaklin, and I asked Bill, who's your best grad student?

14:20.099 --> 14:25.547
And Bill had, as I mentioned earlier, been a long-time friend of mine, he and Bernie Sligar.

14:26.709 --> 14:31.155
And they said Bob Eakland is about the best we've had in a decade.

14:31.856 --> 14:33.638
So I talked Bob into coming here.

14:33.699 --> 14:35.822
Bob's family are from San Antonio.

14:36.663 --> 14:40.268
Kyle Vader's family, if I recall, were also from San Antonio.

14:40.248 --> 14:43.172
Fergie was Arkansas.

14:43.693 --> 14:46.637
We're trying to find people who would not... Where is Eklund now?

14:46.677 --> 14:47.077
Do you know?

14:47.378 --> 14:51.283
Yeah, he's, oh gosh, it's in some ways sad from my standpoint.

14:52.024 --> 14:55.749
He's got a chair, top professor at Auburn.

14:56.070 --> 14:56.831
At Auburn, okay.

14:57.151 --> 14:59.574
But he's retiring and he's a kid yet.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.016
He's only in his late 50s.

15:01.056 --> 15:03.640
He wants to go to Paris and become a painter.

15:03.620 --> 15:08.228
And he's earned enough money apparently to follow that.

15:08.609 --> 15:12.957
I don't know if he's yet retired, but that was the last letter I had from him that he was going to do that.

15:13.618 --> 15:16.644
Anyway and Phil Graham?

15:16.704 --> 15:17.325
Yes.

15:17.879 --> 15:27.756
A fellow named sort of like my name, Green, Jim Green at U of Georgia was an old friend of mine, and I contacted him.

15:28.077 --> 15:37.874
I wanted to get some frankly cheap guys, by which I mean fellows who I didn't have to pay their expenses to come here.

15:38.114 --> 15:39.837
I had to use all expenses.

15:40.171 --> 15:47.569
to wheel and deal the basements and others because they expected to be treated royally before they would consider coming to Texas A&M.

15:48.511 --> 15:53.202
And they were just learning that, gee whiz, they're apparently doing things in the Department of Econ and

15:53.806 --> 15:58.351
Maybe they heard, and frankly our math department was starting to grow if you recall back then.

15:59.012 --> 16:02.336
I think Earl was backing math or Wayne Hall maybe.

16:03.738 --> 16:06.100
Math was doing well and of course chemistry.

16:06.601 --> 16:10.926
And see chemistry was getting through Andy Settle and the Wells Foundation, they got Al Cotton.

16:12.327 --> 16:17.113
And Al is still one of my hopes to get a nice Nobel in his lifetime.

16:17.853 --> 16:32.309
Anyway, Jim Green at Georgia, being an old buddy of mine, I said, Jim, don't recommend anyone to me unless you know these fellows or this fellow will be outstanding academicians.

16:33.110 --> 16:36.554
And if you want to have a good enemy, recommend someone who's bad.

16:37.215 --> 16:37.895
I hire him.

16:38.156 --> 16:39.117
He proves to be bad.

16:39.637 --> 16:40.118
Watch out.

16:40.398 --> 16:41.179
Watch out for me.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.603
Mel, I wouldn't do that to anyone, much less you.

16:45.055 --> 16:47.844
I've got two fellas, Chuck Maurice, Phil Graham.

16:48.727 --> 16:52.500
If you could talk those fellas into going A&M, you'll never regret it.

16:53.341 --> 16:59.370
So I landed up with Chuck and Phil through a friend of mine, Jim Green.

16:59.510 --> 17:02.074
All right, and you hired them both right out of graduate school.

17:05.199 --> 17:06.641
Can I, oh gosh, go ahead.

17:06.681 --> 17:10.787
And I was going to say, I presume that you paid competitive salaries to get them.

17:10.807 --> 17:12.369
Yes.

17:12.389 --> 17:18.218
Oh yes, we were being, the word around the country was, they'll pay you

17:18.198 --> 17:21.162
what you think you're worth if they think you're worth it.

17:23.065 --> 17:28.033
Chuck Maurice at this roasting had a wonderful remark.

17:28.053 --> 17:30.396
He claims, I doubt that this really took place.

17:30.416 --> 17:44.357
I don't think I would do it, but he claimed, and it's on tape, that when I first got to A&M, I said, well, Dr. Greenhut, I want you to know I am now Dr. Maurice.

17:44.978 --> 17:49.683
He said that I said, well, it's a good thing for you, otherwise you'd be canned quickly.

17:53.388 --> 17:59.715
What advice did you give young faculty members like that as they're starting?

17:59.795 --> 18:02.078
What advice did you give them when they got here?

18:03.680 --> 18:06.483
Publish and don't destroy your teaching abilities.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.665
Make sure you do wear a coat and tie.

18:08.806 --> 18:10.007
Actually, John says,

18:10.342 --> 18:14.506
He was the one who had to give that bad message, and others of equivalent kind.

18:14.526 --> 18:20.311
I don't think I used my messenger that much, but John Allen will say I did.

18:20.812 --> 18:21.533
Maybe I did.

18:22.153 --> 18:22.654
Right now.

18:22.674 --> 18:33.464
I told him that this was, as I know, a pretty straight-laced school with a lot of military background, and some of the men out of this university were fantastic soldiers.

18:34.485 --> 18:39.049
And I had trouble with one that I won't mention.

18:39.755 --> 18:43.659
I didn't have trouble, but Earl would have had trouble with one that I had brought in.

18:47.262 --> 18:57.032
Tell me how much you, if you remember, tell me about Phil Graham getting started in politics.

18:58.674 --> 19:08.243
This involved, I was invited to give a talk, I think it was to the Rotary Club, and this friend of mine, Jim Blackman at NSF,

19:08.881 --> 19:17.414
I said, boy, your application for funds here for the department, besides that I had my own application for my own research.

19:18.155 --> 19:22.041
He said, this departmental thing looks pretty darn good.

19:22.081 --> 19:27.970
Why don't you come up here and visit and I'll take you around and have you meet some of the other people who are going to be involved.

19:28.861 --> 19:30.764
And it'd be worth a while, really, Mel.

19:31.004 --> 19:34.549
In other words, he's trying to tell me, you guys want a million dollars out of NSF.

19:34.569 --> 19:35.450
You've got a good chance.

19:35.891 --> 19:38.234
Can you get up here next week?

19:38.254 --> 19:41.118
Oh, my gosh, the answer is, yes, I'm going up.

19:41.579 --> 19:48.448
And then I realized I've got, I'd already promised the Rotary Club I'd be an after-dinner speaker.

19:48.468 --> 19:55.037
And I've got to find someone, I guess, in place where I'll call up the man who, I forget who it was who invited me.

19:55.658 --> 19:57.210
And I told him that I was going to be there.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.205
He said, well, get someone in your place, would you?

19:59.607 --> 20:07.139
Well, I went to my senior professors, like Tom and others, and they were not interested in, that's your job, Mel.

20:07.159 --> 20:10.364
You keep up the goodwill around town.

20:10.665 --> 20:11.586
Don't bother me.

20:13.409 --> 20:19.959
And each one of them, so I thought, well, by gosh, I'd better go down to my assistant professor level.

20:20.801 --> 20:22.183
And I asked Phil Graham.

20:22.724 --> 20:25.969
I said, Phil, I've heard that you enjoy

20:27.350 --> 20:33.523
talking, would you enjoy giving an afternoon talk to the Rotary Club?"

20:33.543 --> 20:35.086
Oh, yes, yes, Mel, I'd love to.

20:36.148 --> 20:37.150
Well, I got back from D.C.

20:37.751 --> 20:46.289
about a week or so or two later, whenever it was, and I called up the fellow who had invited me, and I said, well, I sure hope things worked out well.

20:46.329 --> 20:47.772
How did Phil do?

20:48.460 --> 21:01.069
And the answer I got, frankly, a very hurtful one, well, Mel, if we ever make the mistake of inviting you again, send Phil in your place.

21:01.089 --> 21:04.377
So Phil apparently hit them beautifully as a public speaker.

21:04.981 --> 21:08.809
Next thing I knew from Philly, he thought he wanted to run for politics.

21:09.851 --> 21:10.673
And would I help him?

21:10.693 --> 21:23.479
Because part of my job obviously at A&M was not only to bring in faculty, students, and try to keep things going, and one of the biggest problems was keeping the teaching going the way it had been.

21:24.522 --> 21:33.816
I know we do a bunch of publish and perish guys, teachers, effectively, as fellows who may be more dedicated to the undergraduate student.

21:34.537 --> 21:46.716
But in any event, part of my job was also to glad hand around town and get to know everyone who might really help the university and the department, in effect.

21:47.236 --> 21:51.964
So I didn't know Bob Bernath and Ford Allbidden and all of those fellas.

21:52.004 --> 21:56.792
In fact, Martha and Mari were constant golfers together.

21:58.114 --> 22:02.641
So I said, okay, Phil, I'd be happy to help you go on a political career.

22:02.741 --> 22:13.699
I'll get all the people that I think are wealthy in the community to see if you could, in effect, through a party or two at my house, get funds.

22:14.084 --> 22:18.752
And that's the way it started as far as my collection is concerned.

22:19.253 --> 22:22.799
And he did impress everyone at the house.

22:22.919 --> 22:28.549
And one thing that I knew was going to be good, Phil was fundamentally conservative.

22:29.542 --> 22:41.783
I say fundamentally because some of the stuff I know that fellow's been sponsoring in Washington is a complete negation of the pure principles of conservative economics.

22:42.765 --> 22:50.098
He's a politician now, unfortunately, like all of them become, and I'm sure in the way I played the game,

22:50.618 --> 22:58.231
At A&M I was a politician in my own right, though I like to believe that I'm still the same conservator as I am.

22:59.052 --> 23:12.475
At this roasting, by the way, real funny, I don't know how Jim Griffin did this one to me, but he got a letter apparently signed by Bill Clinton that he was sorry he could not be at this roasting.

23:12.995 --> 23:19.405
And so Jim Griffin's remark was, well, we all thought Mel was a real conservative, but he's really a closet Democrat.

23:23.511 --> 23:26.836
And Phil started out as a Democrat.

23:27.176 --> 23:28.258
Yes.

23:28.678 --> 23:31.162
And he ran first for the Senate?

23:31.182 --> 23:31.763
For the Senate.

23:31.843 --> 23:34.146
He ran against that big guy, Lloyd Benson.

23:34.186 --> 23:34.767
Lloyd Benson.

23:35.088 --> 23:41.297
Did that create any awkwardness in the department that here was a candidate for public office?

23:43.015 --> 23:47.861
No one, I never picked, you probably heard a lot more than he did in this regard.

23:48.081 --> 23:49.163
No, I don't know.

23:49.183 --> 23:52.847
Did he take leave to campaign?

23:53.929 --> 23:56.392
Gee, Haskell, you're scratching my memory too much.

23:56.452 --> 23:57.413
I don't believe he did.

23:57.433 --> 23:59.496
I don't believe he needed leave.

24:00.317 --> 24:07.286
Now, you know, you actually surprised me, something that I just, well, at this stage of the game I was no longer department head, by the way.

24:07.926 --> 24:09.208
I don't believe.

24:09.627 --> 24:12.071
So I never did know that he was missing a lot of classes.

24:14.175 --> 24:24.454
This is in the 70's isn't it that Phil was, see I gave up the hardship out of that interview with Earl Budda based on the LSU thing in 1969.

24:25.035 --> 24:27.720
Oh okay.

24:28.578 --> 24:30.220
The professorship that I wanted.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.222
So you were department head for?

24:32.502 --> 24:33.263
For three years only.

24:33.283 --> 24:33.744
Three years.

24:34.284 --> 24:35.286
But they were hectic three.

24:35.646 --> 24:36.247
Oh, I hear you.

24:36.767 --> 24:37.228
I hear you.

24:38.329 --> 24:39.030
Let's go back.

24:39.270 --> 24:46.418
Describe what it was like for you and your family to get settled into Bryan College Station as a place to live.

24:46.679 --> 24:48.400
Fantastic.

24:48.561 --> 24:55.969
As John Allen, I'm going to use him to give you an idea, John said he was so unbelieving about what was going on here.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.739
He's just getting his doctorate.

24:58.879 --> 24:59.741
He's a nobody.

25:00.363 --> 25:02.568
And who picks him up at the airport?

25:02.588 --> 25:04.572
The president of one of the local banks.

25:05.655 --> 25:07.759
And what does the president of the local bank do?

25:07.780 --> 25:10.466
He says, I'm supposed to take you to the greenhouse.

25:10.486 --> 25:15.477
They're having a party for a bunch of people.

25:16.081 --> 25:21.467
I think you will really enjoy going to that party, so Mel said for me to bring you there."

25:21.487 --> 25:35.181
And John said, when I went in the party, who's there but the Chancellor of the University, or the President of the University rather, Earl Rutter, and department heads, deans, some members of the Board of Trustees?

25:35.741 --> 25:44.991
He said, I was so floored, I couldn't believe that everyone was behind Econ, and surely they weren't there to meet me, of course.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.685
But I was completely captivated by it all.

25:49.526 --> 25:50.467
That's true of me.

25:51.248 --> 26:04.347
Mari and I had, the minute we hit town, between Stan Steven and Ridley Biggs, remember them, and Travis Bryan and others, we were being honored so wonderfully.

26:04.948 --> 26:06.210
Can we do anything for you?

26:06.350 --> 26:11.738
Finally I remember we were having some difficulty getting GTE to give us a phone system quickly.

26:12.342 --> 26:14.585
I forget which one of those I called.

26:15.106 --> 26:15.466
Bingo!

26:15.507 --> 26:18.190
We had the phone system in that same day.

26:18.971 --> 26:38.940
So things that we normally, a new person moving into town could not do for himself, the way this community was responding, and this was not to me, because I was the recipient of it, Maui was the recipient of it, either Earl Butter, Wayne Hall,

26:39.713 --> 26:55.579
Some people at A&M, some group, I don't know how it happened, but they had Stan Stevens over the years, Ridley Biggs, et cetera, you know all of them, Dennis Gehring subsequently, all backing

26:56.268 --> 27:00.094
everything that was happening here.

27:00.615 --> 27:03.079
What about the schools and your children?

27:03.379 --> 27:06.845
How did that transition go?

27:07.606 --> 27:09.690
Well, even that went too good.

27:10.751 --> 27:15.980
Our son John was offered a swimming scholarship at Florida State.

27:17.703 --> 27:20.487
Our daughter Peggy was already at Florida State when we moved here.

27:22.778 --> 27:26.002
Art Adamson, was that our swimming coach I think?

27:27.223 --> 27:36.673
When I mentioned to him, boy my son is going to be swimming for Bim Stolzer over at Florida State, he said, we've never had a full-time, full scholarship for a swimmer yet.

27:37.154 --> 27:41.578
We only give scholarships for football, basketball, things like that.

27:41.959 --> 27:43.040
But maybe I could work it.

27:43.761 --> 27:46.744
Next thing I knew, John was offered a full-time swimmer.

27:46.994 --> 27:49.117
a scholarship for swimming.

27:49.257 --> 27:52.000
John said, no I'm going to stay at Florida State or go to Florida State.

27:52.020 --> 27:53.462
I said, no son, you're coming here.

27:54.883 --> 27:57.186
So everything fell into place.

27:57.947 --> 28:05.817
And mind you, I don't mind claiming that I did a lot as a catalyst for bringing in basements and others.

28:06.578 --> 28:10.803
But the climate was unbelievable back in those days.

28:11.343 --> 28:12.765
The climate for success

28:13.268 --> 28:15.431
I don't know the story of the fellas in chemistry.

28:15.531 --> 28:22.779
I know what was going on in the math because one of the great needs I personally had was for a better math department.

28:23.680 --> 28:26.804
And I think the math department was then starting to blossom and bloom.

28:27.565 --> 28:42.482
And the bankers in town, for some reason, whether someone here at the university, it must have been Erlwetter or some members of the Board of Trustees, and it'd be good if you were trying to find out because you put a finger on something I hadn't thought about.

28:43.002 --> 28:48.787
Murray and I, when we moved into town, by gosh, we were honored citizens before they even knew us.

28:49.208 --> 28:54.913
We could have been the world's greatest jerks, but we were being honored the minute we arrived.

28:55.634 --> 29:11.929
So someone had prepared these people that we didn't know from Adam that we're moving some pretty fine people into academia here at A&M and we would appreciate your whining and dining them and showing them around.

29:12.128 --> 29:13.991
And that sure did happen to us.

29:14.331 --> 29:23.684
And my little daughter who went to school, she was just a natural going into school and I don't think anything special, but she was happy.

29:24.686 --> 29:29.192
And in spite of leaving her old assistant in Tallahassee and stuff like that.

29:30.614 --> 29:41.950
Were there any, as you arrived and then as you were department head, did any key former students or regents attempt to give you advice?

29:43.043 --> 29:49.391
But I did get calls in terms of board of directors and I said I'm too busy, I can't be interested right now, but I'm honored.

29:50.132 --> 29:55.518
So even former students were involved by someone.

29:56.319 --> 30:02.146
Now this, what I'm talking about, board of directors, may have been about two years after we were here, so already the story was going.

30:02.166 --> 30:03.287
Boy, econ is going.

30:04.829 --> 30:12.038
So maybe that may not have reflected some angels, shall I say, for the university.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.702
What about politics?

30:16.284 --> 30:20.731
Did the governor or any members of the legislature, did they help or hinder?

30:22.334 --> 30:31.268
Ben Barnes, I think, was lieutenant governor at the time.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.954
I think someone had a party for him.

30:36.503 --> 30:38.265
I don't recall exactly who it was.

30:40.347 --> 30:44.331
Mari Wood, she remembers things so much better than I do on this level.

30:44.912 --> 30:51.259
But anyway, we were at this party that was honoring Ben Bond.

30:51.639 --> 30:52.120
We met him.

30:53.001 --> 30:54.062
There was a long line.

30:54.302 --> 30:56.965
Everyone walked by and shook his hand in his wife's hand.

30:58.286 --> 31:01.870
And I joined the Century Club, Earl rather thought I should.

31:02.980 --> 31:17.867
And so I had special seating at the football game and we're going down at this football game down this row and who's there but Ben Barnes next to Earl and Margaret Rudder.

31:19.009 --> 31:25.461
And Earl starts saying, well Ben I want you to, oh I know Mel Greenhut.
