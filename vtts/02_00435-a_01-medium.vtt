July 1978, Austin, Texas. Interview with General 
Charles Bond. This is a test. Terry Anderson.

00:17.721 --> 00:23.406
This is an interview with Major General Charles 
Bond, Jr. Today is the 21st of July, 1981. Let's

00:23.426 --> 00:30.612
start off by talking about your early years and 
could you tell me about your parents? Well, my

00:32.313 --> 00:48.772
early years with respect to the military I often 
thought probably started in 1930 when I went to

00:32.313 --> 00:48.772
Forrest High School in Dallas, Texas and joined 
the high school ROTC as a buck private. That's the

00:50.294 --> 00:57.863
first time I put on anything resembling a military 
uniform and I think that's when it started. I grew

01:00.186 --> 01:01.307
to like the military and being a poor boy. Tell me 
about that. I want to find out about your growing

01:07.637 --> 01:09.839
up. Tell me, where'd you grow up? I was born in 
Dallas, Texas in 1915, 22nd of April.

01:24.493 --> 01:29.438
I lived in Dallas my entire life except for the time 
when I entered the military service. And then when

01:29.975 --> 01:33.219
I retired, I came back and retired in Dallas.

01:35.983 --> 01:43.894
I had

01:35.983 --> 01:43.894
two sisters and three brothers. Large family. 
Large family. And my father was a painter and paper

01:46.077 --> 01:50.363
painter. We were definitely a poor family even in 
those days. I was old enough in 1929, 30, 31 to

01:55.912 --> 02:01.139
remember the Depression. And there's no doubt 
those times definitely made an impression on me.

02:08.068 --> 02:09.950
Okay, we're going to talk about that a little bit 
later. Let's talk about your father's education.

02:12.573 --> 02:18.721
My father probably never went further than the 
fourth or fifth grade in grammar school. He, in

02:18.741 --> 02:23.888
effect, ran away from home about the age of eight. 
Really? Yeah. Where was he from? Where was his

02:26.324 --> 02:27.425
home? He was born in Dallas. And back in the 1870s, 
something like that, he died at 89 years old. And I

02:36.539 --> 02:40.005
think he went up to Colorado as a young boy. He 
eventually came back home a member of a large

02:40.025 --> 02:49.139
family and started a painting business. My mother 
How successful was the painting business? He

02:54.461 --> 02:57.385
stayed busy, but it had its ups and downs. Of 
course, during the Depression, it was hard to get

02:57.445 --> 03:02.993
work. I remember going out with him when I was a 
little kid to hunt rabbits to get food. I remember

03:07.879 --> 03:10.743
cutting wood to bring home to have heat. Indeed, I 
remember the Depression. My mother, I doubt

03:15.149 --> 03:20.276
seriously if she ever finished third or fourth 
grade. She was from Oklahoma. And neither one of

03:21.957 --> 03:27.487
them had an education. It was my young years in life 
that I learned the value of education and the

03:27.507 --> 03:37.464
effects of poverty. And I guess... Who told you 
this, or who taught you this? My experience. My

03:44.737 --> 03:45.518
experience. taught me this and I guess it was then 
in my younger years that I practically made a solid

03:46.645 --> 04:02.503
vow to myself that I would get an education some way 
and pull myself up above the poverty that my family

03:46.645 --> 04:02.503
had to live in. I don't criticize or blame my mother 
and father one bit. Matter of fact, my mother was a

04:08.129 --> 04:11.893
saint if there ever was one. by nature of their lack 
of education. In effect, they taught me

04:15.219 --> 04:17.561
negatively if you will. They didn't know any 
better. And I learned by what they didn't know and

04:20.184 --> 04:30.714
saw the impact it had on me and the family by them not 
being educated and so forth. What kind of person

04:31.175 --> 04:34.698
was your dad? My dad was a very independent

04:40.072 --> 04:43.256
type of person, very sensitive. He was a typical 
person that without an education and being

04:44.277 --> 05:02.758
poverty stricken he had an inferiority complex 
and at times was a very angry and almost a mean man.

05:03.479 --> 05:05.702
Mean toward you or toward other people? Toward the 
family. I think my dad was probably responsible

05:07.831 --> 05:12.678
for taking most of the kids out of the school. My 
brothers and sisters, except for one brother,

05:13.099 --> 05:18.286
never finished grammar school. No kidding. And

05:20.529 --> 05:27.039
then I'll get back to the A&M in a minute to how I got 
to A&M. When I graduated from high school, I

05:27.700 --> 05:31.385
couldn't afford to go to college. I had to go to 
work. Did he want to take you out of high school? He

05:35.010 --> 05:35.691
did. Why did you ever stay in? by just sheer 
determination and my friends, parents helping

05:38.189 --> 05:49.301
me, knowing I was determined to go to school. And 
that's one reason I love the military, I guess.

05:51.943 --> 05:53.785
It's my first attraction to the military. 
Military wears uniform. This makes people look

05:56.228 --> 05:58.931
equal. Had I been a civilian, I dare say I wouldn't 
have been able to clothe myself properly to go to

05:59.591 --> 06:06.719
school. During the summer, I worked. with my dad in 
the painting business and save enough money to buy

06:08.851 --> 06:16.363
clothes to go to school the following fall. What 
about the type of person that your mother was? My

06:19.728 --> 06:27.359
mother was a very uneducated person, but 
dedicated and like I say, a perfect saint. The

06:28.000 --> 06:36.293
deprivation she went through and the sacrifice 
she went through for the family was just, there's

06:28.000 --> 06:36.293
nothing in my experience in 66 years and compared 
to it as far as I'm concerned. There's no doubt that

06:41.306 --> 06:42.688
she's in heaven. Both of them, I think, really are 
in heaven.

06:47.592 --> 06:56.281
A very understanding person, and the sacrifices 
she made for the kids, it was something. Now, you

06:56.301 --> 07:01.566
became a leader, and were either of your parents in 
any way leaders? Definitely not. Definitely not.

07:06.192 --> 07:12.479
Again, that's the reason I say the things I learned 
from them in a negative sort of way that they

07:06.192 --> 07:12.479
weren't. I just knew that I was going to have to 
learn these things or raise myself above the

07:14.461 --> 07:35.743
various levels of living that no money, no 
participation in social life, no clothing,

07:14.461 --> 07:35.743
actually hungry at times, respect from your 
fellow man. Sure. These things, which we didn't

07:36.437 --> 07:43.605
have, I guess was imbued in me as a kid. And like 
psychiatrists and psychologists say, the things

07:43.645 --> 07:51.753
that you grow up in your environment as a kid, they 
affect your later life. Sure,

07:51.773 --> 07:54.996
absolutely. Again, I don't criticize my mother 
and father, nor my sisters and brothers. Was the

07:58.299 --> 08:00.041
family in any way religious? My mother was very 
religious, and she tried to continue to get kids to

08:00.882 --> 08:05.967
go to church. My father cared less. My father and 
mother were a little bit different. Both of them,

08:12.302 --> 08:22.678
my mother had very high morals and my father not 
quite so high morally. But they stuck together.

08:24.020 --> 08:26.363
What type of church? The Congregation Church, 
First Congregation Church in Dallas, way back in

08:26.483 --> 08:35.397
the early 20s. and then finally the Presbyterian 
Church.

08:41.620 --> 08:46.826
Was religion in any way an influence on your life 
growing up? Very little, very little. Now, what

08:51.251 --> 08:56.958
were the values that they tried to teach you, or did 
they ever try to teach any values? Say again? The

08:57.499 --> 09:01.764
type of values that they tried to instill in you. 
Well, my father just told me to work. You need to

09:08.910 --> 09:10.272
work and contribute. And in his reasoning, he had 
to do this, see, when he was a kid. Sure. And he felt

09:16.199 --> 09:24.529
that if he had to work and contribute to the family, 
then so should his boys do the same thing. And quite

09:24.589 --> 09:27.753
often, we'd work all week, and it'd end up he 
wouldn't pay us. Really? Which caused a

09:28.593 --> 09:35.422
considerable distaste between, and downright 
hatred sometimes. Why wouldn't he pay you? Well,

09:39.080 --> 09:54.559
for one thing, there were bills that you had to pay, 
and on the other hand, there were a lot of times, I'm

09:39.080 --> 09:54.559
sure, that Dad just felt that when he worked for the 
family, they had to contribute to their upkeep,

09:39.080 --> 09:54.559
and that we kids should do the same way. Sure. But 
many times he did pay us, and that's how I got money

09:57.423 --> 10:04.892
for the coming year to go to school. So hard work. 
hard work. My dad believed in hard work, and bless

10:06.785 --> 10:11.210
his heart, he worked hard. He was painting and 
climbing up and down ladders when he was in his

10:11.330 --> 10:15.796
early 80s. And I noticed that my people called me a 
workaholic. I don't consider it work. Today I'm

10:22.104 --> 10:27.311
retired and I love to work in the yard, and people 
say I'm working all the time. They call it work. I

10:28.512 --> 10:30.855
call it diversion. and keeping busy and loving it. 
Yeah, enjoying yourself. Enjoying it. You became

10:38.702 --> 10:41.485
a major general leader. In what way do you think 
your parents are responsible for your success?

10:49.733 --> 10:58.362
Well, going back to my previous statement, the 
negative way in which they impressed me on things

10:49.733 --> 10:58.362
to achieve, to get someplace, It might very well be 
one of the reasons I decided to join the United

10:59.759 --> 11:05.086
States Army. Fifteenth Field Artillery at Fort 
Sam Houston in 1935 was by determination to get a

11:05.907 --> 11:15.239
chance to go to college. I graduated from high 
school in 1933, Forest High School. And I had

11:19.905 --> 11:28.737
aspirations of wanting to be an aeronautical 
engineer, and I knew I'd have college to get a

11:29.020 --> 11:30.202
degree. I wanted to go to A&M then, in the early 30s. 
Well, 30s, I mean 34, I wanted to go to A&M, but I

11:34.688 --> 11:39.214
couldn't afford it. And of course, there was a 
negative attitude on the part of my father. He

11:41.838 --> 11:42.619
wanted me to work. I did work in the station for a 
while, then with him for a while. But I lost your

11:46.765 --> 11:51.251
train of thought. What did you ask me? I was 
wondering about the ways in which your parents are

11:52.433 --> 11:58.842
responsible for getting them in Your success? 
Well, again, determination. I was going to

12:04.041 --> 12:04.962
achieve this. This was the last thing I did. I was 
going to get someplace. This was the last thing I

12:10.771 --> 12:11.792
did. I was going to get out of the environment. 
Perhaps that's one reason I decided to join the

12:13.916 --> 12:15.979
Army. I was going to get an education. They didn't 
have one. My older brothers and sisters didn't

12:19.464 --> 12:22.489
have an education. Looking back now, I don't know 
how in the world at that age I even had enough

12:27.897 --> 12:42.752
foresight to sit and consider such things that you 
might say adults consider today, what effect it's

12:27.897 --> 12:42.752
going to have on me in the future. And I had a chance 
to join the Army for one year to compete for entry to

12:43.212 --> 12:54.343
West Point through appointments that the Army 
gave from enlisted people. And I went to Fort Sam

13:00.209 --> 13:18.115
Houston for one year, and I remember making a grade 
of 96 on the entrance exam to West Point, which

13:00.209 --> 13:18.115
would be easily qualifying me for an entry if it had 
a congressional appointment, but I didn't have

13:00.209 --> 13:18.115
enough there again. I didn't have enough clout or 
contacts, if you will, through my father and

13:20.125 --> 13:26.711
mother and my friends to get a congressional 
appointment. But there were only 23, I think, 23

13:26.731 --> 13:33.377
vacancies, 26, something like that. And so you 
didn't go? I didn't go. But again, it might be that

13:35.278 --> 13:46.608
it was for the best, because I turned right around 
and took the written examination to the flying

13:35.278 --> 13:46.608
cadets. And lo and behold, passed that. So I 
entered the Flying Cadets without any college

13:50.365 --> 13:54.929
whatsoever in 1938. But it seems to me, then, that 
one of the things that you had was a desire to

13:55.810 --> 14:00.434
escape. Right. Exactly. Determination to 
escape, I guess I should say. And get out of the

14:06.178 --> 14:07.399
environment. I didn't like it. Even at that age, I 
guess I was ashamed of part of it, the way we lived. I

14:15.766 --> 14:19.950
can look back now and remember embarrassing 
moments that I was ashamed of. No different, I

14:20.032 --> 14:24.598
guess, from any poverty-stricken family. Hunger

14:26.140 --> 14:32.208
never did really bother me. I say I went hungry, I 
didn't really go real hungry, but definitely

14:32.729 --> 14:38.877
without money. I went to high school many days 
without a penny in my pocket and skipped lunch.

14:45.265 --> 14:47.228
How'd you get along with your brothers and 
sisters? You had a large crew.

14:51.537 --> 14:59.045
My brothers and sisters respected me then, and of 
course they respect me today. As a matter of fact,

15:00.467 --> 15:08.215
my youngest brother, through my efforts, went to 
Texas A&M. I paid his way through. And then he

15:11.239 --> 15:15.684
followed me and went to the Air Force and did fairly 
well. He got to be a lieutenant colonel before he

15:15.704 --> 15:17.826
retired. My oldest brother God bless his heart, 
helped me. He bought my graduation suit when I

15:23.265 --> 15:26.208
graduated from high school. No kidding. My oldest 
sister, who's dead now, was, again, she was like my

15:28.090 --> 15:33.555
mother, quite a saint. And she helped me. She knew 
that I wanted to improve. And she had the same ideas

15:39.641 --> 15:43.225
and philosophies of life I had. But another sister 
I had, we didn't get along too well together. and

15:48.794 --> 15:55.409
another younger brother, we had respect, mutual 
respect for each other.

15:58.756 --> 16:08.558
My childhood life definitely had an impact on my 
desires to become something in life. And I

16:09.078 --> 16:14.547
attribute that, as I say, to sort of a negative way 
to my mother and father. What they didn't have, I

16:14.987 --> 16:17.111
would determine and get. Okay, now let's talk 
about your education. But before we do that, I want

16:19.975 --> 16:23.340
to check. I wear a hearing aid, but it's not really 
that bad. Mostly it's resolution. Okay, now as far

16:30.632 --> 16:34.157
as your education, let's start... It's rather 
unusual when a father does not finish high school

16:34.778 --> 16:45.635
or even go to high school and then does not want 
their son to go on. And you did. And your other

16:47.477 --> 16:49.781
brothers didn't. You must have been very 
determined. So let's talk about your education,

16:51.143 --> 16:54.007
your early years. Well, of course, I went to 
grammar school at Colonial Hill Grammar School in

16:54.949 --> 17:03.722
South Dallas, near where we lived. And always did 
well. Again, I guess I did very well in grammar

17:07.877 --> 17:12.823
school. As a matter of fact, I was better than a C 
average kid, I'm sure. And I did well in athletics.

17:20.592 --> 17:21.893
I was a member of the softball team. And got along 
well with students. Always got along well with

17:25.818 --> 17:28.921
other students. Made a U one day. one time in music, 
and it almost killed me. And I remember crying and

17:36.914 --> 17:49.730
talking to the teacher about it, and the next 
grade, which was three months after that, I

17:36.914 --> 17:49.730
practiced straight A's. And this carried on 
through high school. In high school I practiced

17:53.935 --> 17:55.937
straight A's. What were your favorite subjects?

18:00.520 --> 18:08.732
I think in grammar school, my favorite subjects 
were drawing and arithmetic. In high school,

18:08.752 --> 18:14.139
definitely science, physics, and military. I 
loved the ROTC. And it was obvious as I proceeded

18:16.082 --> 18:27.799
through high school that I was doing well, or 
better than the average, and I felt more

18:16.082 --> 18:27.799
competent. And I guess it's one of the reasons 
Self-confidence, you know, you develop. Yeah,

18:32.020 --> 18:37.746
school developed some self-confidence for you 
because you were doing so well in comparison with

18:32.020 --> 18:37.746
your peers. Is that right? Right. OK, were you in 
activities? You said earlier that you played some

18:42.891 --> 18:45.053
softball. Were you on the varsity in any sports? 
Well, in grammar school, I was always on the soccer

18:48.857 --> 18:54.843
team, the softball team. I was one of the dominant 
figures in my classes in all sports in a grammar

19:00.005 --> 19:08.917
school, if you will, like soccer and softball.

19:10.339 --> 19:23.616
In

19:10.339 --> 19:23.616
high school, I was on the field and track team as a 
discus and javelin thrower, and I represented

19:10.339 --> 19:23.616
Forest High School.

19:28.237 --> 19:28.958
some medals. When I went to summer military camp, I 
always won those events in the entire summer camp

19:28.998 --> 19:40.853
of Walter Dulles High School, in the discus and 
javelin, and in the baseball throw. I probably

19:40.873 --> 19:46.581
still hold the record for baseball throw at Camp 
Dulles at Mineral Wells in 1934. No kidding. As a

19:47.282 --> 19:52.168
kid that age throwing a baseball is 320 feet. 
That's fantastic. I'm sure that record shows. You

19:58.146 --> 20:00.329
threw a baseball on a football field? 320 feet. And 
even when it hit, it hit a flagpole about 20 feet

20:02.672 --> 20:06.236
above the ground. So it had gone further. And 
furthermore, it was a wet baseball. And football,

20:12.103 --> 20:16.088
I was a- You should have played in the outfield. You 
should have played in the outfield. Well, I played

20:17.429 --> 20:22.155
usually second base.

20:23.165 --> 20:28.332
And

20:23.165 --> 20:28.332
the other sport in high school was football. I 
didn't care for basketball or baseball. I

20:31.076 --> 20:33.440
actually didn't have time much going for those 
sports. But I was a famous one minute man in

20:33.460 --> 20:35.743
football. They put me in at the last minute if they 
knew they had completely lost or they knew they had

20:35.763 --> 20:40.891
won. I was a halfback. I loved football. Today I 
love it. How good were you? I was a member of the

20:50.264 --> 20:52.227
second team. But at that time, there was no doubt. 
Matter of fact, I became the cadet colonel in my

20:56.203 --> 21:02.852
senior year to command the regiment of Forest High 
School. OK, let's talk about that. And that took

21:05.135 --> 21:07.138
most of my time. And furthermore, I was vice 
president of my senior class and a member of tall

21:07.439 --> 21:18.314
beta pi for the National Honor Society for high 
grades and all. But really, I was quite active. And

21:19.976 --> 21:22.500
I really didn't have much time to devote to 
football, I think I could have done better. But my

21:25.800 --> 21:30.205
coach, who was also my algebra coach, knew of my 
other activity. And I think it was just sort of a

21:30.225 --> 21:33.769
compromise. But I was good enough to make the 
second team. I'm always interested in when

21:38.274 --> 21:44.141
generals started leadership roles. And it 
appears to me that you started yours by the time you

21:44.261 --> 21:49.827
were 14, 15 years old. Is that true? Or would you 
tell me? I would imagine that, since you asked me

21:51.640 --> 22:19.504
the question and being objective and honest about 
it, I would say that in about the middle of my high

21:51.640 --> 22:19.504
school career, my teachers, and particularly my 
commandant, Colonel Coleman of Forrest High

21:51.640 --> 22:19.504
School in Dallas, began to recognize

22:21.323 --> 22:27.392
above average devotion to military and to really 
anything I did. I was an A student and anything I did

22:27.412 --> 22:36.625
I always strived to do it the best I could. That was a 
motto that I developed as a kid and still have. If

22:40.791 --> 22:43.034
you don't do it right, don't do it at all. I teach my 
kids the same thing. I guess they saw it and began to

22:46.417 --> 22:51.745
promote me faster. I was promoted faster than my 
cohorts of compatriots and military, and I

22:52.547 --> 23:07.330
rapidly became the, well, I was made the top man in 
the high school ROTC, the cadet colonel. And I'm

23:08.612 --> 23:13.420
sure it was in those last few years in high school 
that to my staying in the military and even went

23:14.007 --> 23:42.753
beyond that to get a little bit more money and at the 
behest of some of my older friends in high school

23:14.007 --> 23:42.753
ROTC who were members of the Texas National Guard, 
I joined the 144th Infantry in Dallas as a private

23:14.007 --> 23:42.753
in an infantry outfit and rapidly became a platoon 
sergeant in the Texas National Guard in the

23:14.007 --> 23:42.753
infantry. How old were you at that time? I was a 
junior in high school in 1932, so that made me 17

23:44.770 --> 23:55.562
years old. So when you were 18 you were already a 
sergeant in the National Guard? Yes. When I was 17 I

24:00.527 --> 24:12.600
was a sergeant in the Texas National Guard 
infantry and I was the cadet colonel of the Forest

24:00.527 --> 24:12.600
High School ROTC Regiment. And I think it was there 
that really I still wanted an aeronautical

24:13.475 --> 24:23.508
engineer degree and to build airplanes. And I 
think it was after a high school ROTC that I had a

24:23.528 --> 24:33.120
chance to join the Army for one year to get to West 
Point, and that was a way to get my education.

24:35.824 --> 24:42.452
Not doing that, then joining the flying cadets and 
becoming actually a military pilot in the Army Air

24:35.824 --> 24:42.452
Corps at that time. Then I really decided to stick 
to the military and be a fighter pilot. What was it

24:49.590 --> 24:58.242
about the military that was so attractive to you 
when you were 17 years old? Well, it partly solved

24:58.262 --> 25:10.380
my problem of

24:58.262 --> 25:10.380
feeling on a level with my fellow students, both 
girls and boys, wore uniforms. And therefore, I

25:16.480 --> 25:27.992
wasn't, I didn't appear in class in some second 
grade types of clothes, if you will. And that

25:28.092 --> 25:31.696
increased my, helped increase my ego. And my 
closest friend, whose parents were Bohemians,

25:39.892 --> 25:50.447
They took an interest in me and recognized my 
desire to be a higher-class person and all, and

25:39.892 --> 25:50.447
they actually paid for my summer camp. They bought 
my first pair of boots when I became an officer in

25:50.467 --> 25:59.059
high school ROTC. Actually, high-grade 
German-made boots in Germany when they visited

25:59.079 --> 26:06.810
Europe, they bought me a pair of German boots, 
German-made field boots back. I wore those all

26:07.246 --> 26:11.011
year during my four years in high school. I 
probably had them half sold at least six times.

26:16.819 --> 26:23.848
So one of the things you liked about the military 
was that everybody in uniform was on an equal

26:16.819 --> 26:23.848
point. Right. And I liked the, I won't say I liked 
the regimentation, but I liked the feeling of

26:24.850 --> 26:36.105
being a part of something.

26:37.402 --> 26:53.718
As I became a corporal or sergeant, I developed the 
feel of commanding people, or if you will, not so

26:37.402 --> 26:53.718
much commanding them, but motivating them. 
Having a person do something that I told him to do.

26:58.483 --> 26:59.024
Follow orders. Follow orders. I

27:01.126 --> 27:06.531
learned the difference between people. very 
rapidly in telling a person to do something. When

27:09.815 --> 27:21.229
he wouldn't do it, when he would do it, when you're 
not sure he's going to do it, the dependability of

27:09.815 --> 27:21.229
people.

27:21.249 --> 27:25.113
I began to learn how to motivate people to do things 
that they didn't want to do. I learned to recognize

27:26.015 --> 27:36.147
the differences in young men's feelings, whether 
they wanted to be in the military or not.

27:37.645 --> 27:45.515
There were many wealthy children, children from 
wealthy parents that went to my high school. And

27:45.535 --> 27:56.709
there were a lot of poor boys that went to my high 
school, but the majority of them were wealthy

27:45.535 --> 27:56.709
people from Jewish families in the South Dallas 
area. And many of these boys would be under me in

27:57.750 --> 28:05.239
military, and here I was, a poor boy.

28:06.417 --> 28:07.398
What about the discipline? Did you like 
discipline?

28:13.948 --> 28:15.170
I didn't mind discipline. As a matter of fact, you 
can tell by what I've told you so far that I learned

28:15.230 --> 28:21.900
to discipline myself. I'm a self-disciplined 
person, very, very self-disciplined person. And

28:26.667 --> 28:30.813
I have no patience with a person who isn't 
self-disciplined. This is a characteristic I

28:30.833 --> 28:32.536
developed. Well, see, this fits with military. I 
don't mind discipline. I admire it.

28:42.829 --> 28:47.417
I love confidence, competence, reliability.

28:50.261 --> 28:54.408
I am happy to see the results of my work. I'm happy to 
see my impact on people. I take pride in this. I take

29:01.280 --> 29:02.682
great pride in getting a person to do something, 
and while he's doing it, he likes it. I learned this

29:09.752 --> 29:10.793
in military. In other words, it was the first real 
big step in overcoming my

29:12.294 --> 29:25.147
poor environment as a poor kid. I began to rise 
above it, and I loved it. And it was shortly after my

29:31.366 --> 29:45.424
graduation from high school in ROTC and being a 
member of the National Guard, which continued on

29:31.366 --> 29:45.424
for two or three years until I entered the flying 
contest in 1938, that I knew I was going to stay with

29:31.366 --> 29:45.424
the military. So you had already made up your mind 
as a young man that you wanted to have a military

29:46.905 --> 29:52.573
career? I had made up my mind in my latter teenage 
years that I was going to have a military career.

29:59.125 --> 30:01.748
Did you consider yourself popular in high school?

30:06.214 --> 30:08.777
It's interesting you ask that question. I was 
elected the most popular student in my senior

30:08.797 --> 30:14.725
class band. And surprisingly, the girl I was going 
with was elected the most popular girl. And the way

30:20.312 --> 30:28.963
they put it, though, is the one most likely to 
succeed and best liked by his fellow students. the

30:30.563 --> 30:31.604
way they described it. And I'll never forget it as 
long as I live. And I'm impressed with what you're

30:34.768 --> 30:39.334
doing on the team. My picture was published in the 
front page of Dallas Morning News that day. I bet

30:46.664 --> 30:49.127
you have a copy of that around the house someplace. 
I have a picture in one of my albums someplace. Now,

30:54.334 --> 31:00.081
it seems to me then that when you graduated from 
high school, you had some firm goals. Is that true?

31:02.397 --> 31:08.044
Yes, when I graduated from high school, I 
definitely wanted college education, and I

31:02.397 --> 31:08.044
wanted to go to Texas A&M. That was in 1933. But the 
influence of my father again, the pressure, if you

31:10.206 --> 31:28.667
will, to work, and the fact that he couldn't or 
wouldn't help And he really couldn't help

31:29.828 --> 31:35.734
financially to send me to college, because they 
had other kids to take care of, too. I just knew I was

31:37.495 --> 31:39.557
going to have to work for a while. And it was in... 
Did you ever think about applying for

31:40.158 --> 31:46.504
scholarships to any universities?

31:48.285 --> 31:53.130
I really didn't have anything to establish the 
basis for a scholarship, except good grades. I

31:54.551 --> 31:55.252
didn't do it. I think it might have been because I 
figured I was going to have to work a while to help

31:58.060 --> 32:01.785
the family. Why did you think that you wanted to go 
to Texas A&M instead of some other university?

32:08.194 --> 32:11.058
Well, Texas A&M was one thing, was military 
school. Sure. And I couldn't get a congressional

32:11.980 --> 32:17.047
appointment to go to West Point. Yeah. And at least 
I'd be able to take military, and I just liked what I

32:18.229 --> 32:26.380
had learned about colleges compared to all of 
them, but I just want to go to Texas A&M. It's a band

32:31.603 --> 32:32.865
school. You just liked what you heard about it. 
Right, right. Now, let's talk about the

32:38.752 --> 32:40.554
Depression. You said that the Depression had an 
impact on your life. Would you explain that?

32:47.942 --> 32:56.232
Well, when you live in a crowded house, and 
sometimes all you have at night is lot of beans and

32:56.701 --> 33:26.353
if you get in late the other kids have eaten more 
than their share and not much left and when you have

32:56.701 --> 33:26.353
to sleep in a bed with as a young kid now this was in 
1929 let's say I was 14 years old maybe have to sleep

32:56.701 --> 33:26.353
in even in the same bed with your sister in a bedroom 
with two other beds with some other kids in it, and

33:26.519 --> 33:56.020
having an outside toilet, no indoor sewage 
facilities, and in a kitchen where my mother had no

33:26.519 --> 33:56.020
modern sink to work out of, had to carry water from 
outside, and

33:26.519 --> 33:56.020
having to go out and chop wood to put in the stove for 
heat and for cooking. and sometimes it seemed that

33:56.742 --> 34:01.087
I was the only boy to do it.

34:06.993 --> 34:23.391
Having the lights turned off because you can't pay 
the bill, having the phone cut up because you can't

34:06.993 --> 34:23.391
pay the bill,

34:06.993 --> 34:23.391
not being able to pay the doctor bills, seeing my 
sisters and brothers go with teeth that needed

34:24.569 --> 34:32.118
fixing and seeing my fellow students having their 
teeth fixed and my sister's brother's not. All of

34:33.459 --> 34:41.449
these things make an impression on me.

34:41.809 --> 34:43.671
What was that impression? You want to do better. 
You want to get out of it. You know you can do better.

34:51.781 --> 34:52.922
Detecting a feeling from my relatives, who were 
better off than my mother and father on both sides,

34:54.067 --> 35:08.604
particularly my father's side, where they looked 
down on my family, even my, looked down even on my

34:54.067 --> 35:08.604
father, his own brother and sister did.

35:10.206 --> 35:12.429
These things left an imprint on me. I guess all of 
these things made me quite an analytical type of a

35:14.071 --> 35:21.660
person, even in my young teens. into why these, why 
this, why so forth and so forth, and having to

35:23.092 --> 35:49.858
submit and work while my fellow students played 
and had money to go to shows and so forth,

35:23.092 --> 35:49.858
not being able to dress well enough to even have 
dates really living a little bit in chain all of

35:50.378 --> 36:05.755
these things have an impact and there are all of 
these things all the economic conditions did you

35:50.378 --> 36:05.755
say that your father had a hard time finding work 
during the Depression? So it got worse during the

36:08.909 --> 36:11.072
Depression? Yes. Oh, yes. You said 1929, of 
course, that's when the Depression starts, but it

36:13.034 --> 36:18.659
really hits the balls in 1932. Well, 32 and 33, 
that's right. And it was in 1929, 1933, you see that

36:23.264 --> 36:28.790
I was in high school. And like I say, I had my 
friends, parents, not provided the money to buy my

36:32.718 --> 36:43.233
uniform, particularly those boots, costly 
boots, a uniform which you wore every day to go to

36:32.718 --> 36:43.233
high school. I am sure, I'm almost sure, I had to 
drop out of high school because I wouldn't have

36:43.654 --> 36:53.208
clothes

36:43.654 --> 36:53.208
to wear. My dad didn't have enough money to, 
sometimes you've got to work for a week or so. And

36:58.275 --> 37:00.919
living from day to day, He wouldn't give me, some 
mornings even, you know, upset, my dad wouldn't

37:02.097 --> 37:18.997
even give me the fifteen cents for lunch money that 
I would use to buy, you know, maybe a hamburger and a

37:02.097 --> 37:18.997
glass of milk for lunch. Sometimes he's irate at me 
because I wouldn't quit school. He wouldn't give

37:23.061 --> 37:24.343
me the fifteen cents. But nevertheless, somehow 
or another, I always managed to have seven cents 14

37:30.245 --> 37:34.752
cents, 7 cents to come back on car fare in my last 
year in high school.

37:38.698 --> 37:49.494
Many people were poverty stricken in our 
environment where we lived during the

37:38.698 --> 37:49.494
Depression.

37:52.378 --> 37:55.623
But it seemed like we were always worse off. My dad 
was not a good manager. He was a selfish person, and

37:57.481 --> 38:05.893
he'd spend money on his car before he'd spend money 
on some of us kids. What did your mother think about

38:05.913 --> 38:07.936
it? My mother and father thought an awful lot about 
this. Her philosophy was, I guess I got my basic

38:11.422 --> 38:17.751
philosophy from my mother, sacrifice and so 
forth. But she and my father clashed an awful lot.

38:22.057 --> 38:26.041
And of course, the environment is what made it that 
way, not enough to go around. And my mother

38:26.401 --> 38:28.803
probably didn't get along well at all. And of 
course, it's another thing I observed. Sure. Did

38:34.008 --> 38:38.993
your father ever accept, or did your family ever 
accept any federal help? Because this is the time

38:39.013 --> 38:44.278
that Franklin Roosevelt comes in and establishes 
the New Deal.

38:48.308 --> 38:55.118
My father definitely would take any handout he 
could get and wasn't ashamed of it at all. And so he

38:56.040 --> 38:57.822
accepted federal funds? Yes. Well, I don't 
remember any particular federal funds at that

38:58.704 --> 39:03.230
time, like food stamps as they are today. But it 
seemed like there was some sort of an organization

39:05.374 --> 39:12.885
where he actually went down and got food. I can't 
remember this very well. But I do need church or

39:15.545 --> 39:19.489
some YMCA or Salvation Army or something. No, we 
never got any help from that. Through my mother's

39:21.911 --> 39:37.125
religious zeal to keep us kids in church, the 
minister would come to see us, but I don't remember

39:21.911 --> 39:37.125
ever any financial help from a church or any YMCA 
organization.

39:39.708 --> 39:41.890
My neighbors would help, yes. My relatives, 
particularly my favorite Uncle John, dad's

39:42.173 --> 39:50.502
brother, who was a court reporter at that time, he 
would help a lot. And I became the pride and joy of

39:50.522 --> 39:56.948
his life when I graduated from high school with 
honors.

40:02.814 --> 40:04.436
It was hard, hard times. Did your father ever work 
for the WPA or the CCCs or anything like that? No,

40:10.182 --> 40:10.442
no. And to carry on and answer your question, I 
remember it was in 1936 and 37, through the Home

40:11.097 --> 40:25.256
Owners Loan Corporation, where they helped 
people pay for their home.

40:29.601 --> 40:40.716
My dad, through a job he had with a southwestern 
life insurance company man, painting houses,

40:41.371 --> 40:48.820
buy a house in Oak Cliff at quite a reduced price. 
And immediately thereafter, it was obvious he

40:49.220 --> 40:54.947
couldn't make the payments. The payments were $37 
and $50. No, the payments were $50 a month. And I

41:03.738 --> 41:11.327
remember taking a job with the US Treasury 
dispersing office in 1938.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.711
six, and seven. And I would pay those payments on 
that home. That's the only way we could keep that

41:20.114 --> 41:21.837
home. You made that much money? I made $37.50 every 
two weeks. And I would take $25 each two weeks and

41:26.864 --> 41:35.557
keep up the payments on that. Whenever he failed, I 
would make the payments. That's the only way we

41:37.660 --> 41:40.344
kept that home for a while. How long did you keep 
that home? We kept that home until I... left went to

41:45.142 --> 42:13.326
the flying cadets and uh was away from home of 
course and military and then my dad lost it he could

41:45.142 --> 42:13.326
no longer make those payments

41:45.142 --> 42:13.326
what what political party did he vote for i guess my 
dad today painted grave was still a democrat uh did

41:45.142 --> 42:13.326
he support franklin roosevelt i he He talked 
openly about supporting the president, but I

42:13.627 --> 42:23.857
doubt, seriously, my dad and mother ever voted in 
their entire life. But he was definitely a

42:23.877 --> 42:25.579
Democrat. Hated the Republicans. To him, the 
Republican was a rich man's party. The Democrat

42:29.483 --> 42:31.284
was a poor man's party. Therefore, I'm a Democrat. 
Did that have any influence on your political

42:33.667 --> 42:36.469
philosophy? Looking back, no. Today, I'd call 
myself, really, if you will, more of an

42:43.900 --> 42:47.564
independent, I've always thought for myself. Of 
course, in the military life, you know, it's a

42:47.644 --> 43:05.362
little bit different, but I'd call myself more of 
an independent, definitely, absolutely, and

42:47.644 --> 43:05.362
absolutely a conservative, assuming the 
conservative and the old, you know, definition. A

43:07.164 --> 43:11.629
conservative on what issues? Every issue you can 
think of. I think that the Social Security Act,

43:13.390 --> 43:42.105
although conceived probably in the right spirit 
at the time of the Roosevelt administration, is

43:13.390 --> 43:42.105
probably today one of the worst things that could 
have happened to this country from the standpoint

43:13.390 --> 43:42.105
of our democratic system and the old system in the 
United States, the economy where a man has a chance

43:13.390 --> 43:42.105
to work. make a living. I think it's, I think in 
concept, it is a horrible thing.

43:51.811 --> 43:53.472
And I'm drawing it. And you're drawing it. And I'm 
drawing it. Do you see any inconsistency there?

43:57.877 --> 43:58.517
Nope. I paid them.

44:04.823 --> 44:05.604
Okay. You did. Right. And I wonder what's going to 
happen to The money that you're putting in this

44:11.718 --> 44:28.604
thing now, and your later life, the main thing that 
I don't like about is they tell me right now, we're

44:11.718 --> 44:28.604
getting off subject, but this is something I feel 
strong about. Right now, I cannot make more than

44:28.624 --> 44:37.377
$463 a month, or they'll take money away from me. 
Now, that is something. Where's the incentive?

44:40.945 --> 44:43.629
Where's the incentive? They say when you get 72, 
you make all the money you want to. It's basically

44:47.816 --> 44:50.481
wrong, the concept of it. To pay,

44:50.501 --> 44:59.155
well, in effect, if you will, you can do it paying 
people not to work. And no wonder there is graft in

44:59.175 --> 45:02.059
it. No wonder it opens the field for People who 
don't have the so-called people of the minority,

45:07.473 --> 45:19.088
if you will, and the culture of some of them. No 
wonder. Well, we're all going to get back now. I

45:24.595 --> 45:26.538
wanted to know your political philosophy. And 
basically, you say you're conservative as far as

45:26.598 --> 45:29.842
everything's concerned. Well, I am for it. And in 
other words, you voted then for the Republicans

45:32.105 --> 45:36.771
straight through. I voted for Reagan and his 
philosophy. What about earlier? Have you

45:42.766 --> 45:45.188
switched as far as when you got older? Forward, I 
voted for Nixon. I was for Kennedy. Did you vote for

45:50.594 --> 45:53.637
Goldwater? I don't remember voting that year. I 
don't remember voting that year. But you were for

45:59.003 --> 45:59.964
Kennedy? Yes, yes. I don't know why, but I think 
that young fellow would have been one of our

46:02.126 --> 46:07.332
greatest presidents if he continued. I liked his 
leadership. He stood up to Russia and Russia

46:11.867 --> 46:15.751
backed down. I'll never forget that as long as I 
live. And people today don't realize this. I was in

46:21.597 --> 46:30.006
Moscow for a year and I know what makes the Russians 
stand up and think and pull back and stop. It's

46:31.048 --> 46:33.350
force. They respect it. We're going to get to that 
when we get there. Okay, so we're basically done

46:36.927 --> 46:42.013
with your education. But let's go now to the 
beginnings of your military career. Tell me about

46:47.039 --> 46:48.721
that. You mean professional? Yeah. Well, like I 
say, I was... You couldn't get into West Point. I

46:55.409 --> 46:56.510
couldn't get into West Point. You couldn't get 
into the Army Air Corps. Greatest

46:58.593 --> 47:00.635
disappointments in my young life. But looking 
back now, it's all happened for the best, I'm sure.
