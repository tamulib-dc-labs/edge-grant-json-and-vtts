WEBVTT

00:03.322 --> 00:14.433
and sitting in Dick Hervey's study, getting ready 
to chat with him about his years here in College

00:03.322 --> 00:14.433
Station with former students and helping A&M in 
many, many ways.

00:17.916 --> 00:18.977
Let's see. To begin with, in case someone was 
looking at this and didn't know who you were, would

00:18.997 --> 00:31.489
you give a brief biographical review before you 
came back to A&M after the war? before I came back

00:32.870 --> 00:35.674
after the war. I enrolled at A&M in 1938. Grew up 
where? Grew up in Rainbow, Texas. Graduated in

00:41.163 --> 00:44.287
high school, class of 38. Came to A&M in the fall of 
38 and graduated in the spring of 42 with a degree in

00:45.088 --> 00:57.067
marketing and finance. Was in the M3 ROTC 
Transferred into the Air Force before

01:00.038 --> 01:03.583
graduating. Went into the Air Force the day after I 
got my degree from A&M, which was May 7th, 16th,

01:03.603 --> 01:11.194
1942. Went into the Air Force for four years. Came 
out of the service in January of 46. And came to A&M

01:22.191 --> 01:27.919
as Executive Secretary of the Association of 
Foreign Students. On October the 1st, 1947. Now,

01:31.907 --> 01:37.857
how did they and you link up at that point? I was a 
very good friend of E. E. McQuillan, who was the

01:37.877 --> 01:47.752
executive director of the association during my 
days in A&M. And he decided that he'd move over with

01:48.413 --> 01:55.003
the university as director of development. And 
when he did that, the position of executive

01:56.384 --> 02:02.993
director of the association became open. I was on 
his executive board at the time, the youngest

02:03.013 --> 02:08.420
member of his board. And he called me and asked if I 
wanted to apply for the position, and I said yes.

02:13.947 --> 02:17.312
And I did apply for the position and was given the 
job. And so you began, what was the- I began October

02:19.494 --> 02:26.003
the 1st, 1947. Describe the association staff and 
so forth at that time. At that time, there were

02:31.640 --> 02:35.926
about 10 people on the staff of the association. We 
had 40,000 addresses of graduates and former

02:37.107 --> 02:45.579
students. We had a bookkeeper, the director. The 
bookkeeper was Mr. Lonnie Locke. We had a

02:52.595 --> 02:57.480
secretary to the executive director. That was 
Marie Kalanick. We had Ms. Woody Mae Shepherd, who

02:59.842 --> 03:07.790
was head of the class reunions and class programs. 
We had Doris Wren, who worked on records. And in the

03:15.257 --> 03:21.943
mailroom, we had Ms. Helen Price, who is now the 
wife former dean of the School of Veterinary

03:22.447 --> 03:26.331
Medicine, worked in records. And we had a little 
student wife named Higgins, whose husband had

03:27.793 --> 03:37.804
played in on the football team. And that was about 
it. Where were we? We were located in the

03:40.087 --> 03:46.194
administration building at the east gate. As you 
go up the steps to the back, the first floor, turn

03:52.332 --> 03:57.258
around right to the right, and the first doors on 
the right was the Former Students Association. We

03:58.319 --> 04:08.312
had two offices, one big central office, my 
office, and then we had a mailroom office down the

03:58.319 --> 04:08.312
hall. That was the size of it. And it was officially 
entitled the same as it is now? The Association of

04:14.079 --> 04:17.563
Former Students, which was named about Woolen 
became executive secretary in 1926, and they had a

04:19.653 --> 04:33.655
reorganization of the association, and they 
named it that at that time, in the late 20s. You

04:34.897 --> 04:36.659
mentioned 40,000 names. Computers weren't 
around then. No. How did y'all have those

04:39.263 --> 04:43.029
available? Our records were all on the 
dressograph plates. which I guess was the

04:47.800 --> 04:51.884
forerunner of a computer car. And we had it so set 
that we could tab it for a contribution or a

04:51.904 --> 04:57.729
non-contribution. We had the class numeral on it. 
We had the major course of study, got the degree in

05:00.071 --> 05:07.138
veterinary medicine or agriculture or whatever. 
And we were doing the best we could with what we had.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.423
And you had also, I presume, some geographic. So if 
I wanted everybody from the Dallas area. They were

05:14.965 --> 05:16.727
organized geographically. Geographically and 
by class. So we could pull out cities or counties or

05:20.676 --> 05:27.303
states or whatever. And so that's 1947. And the 
president at that time of A&M. The president, when

05:35.191 --> 05:42.859
I went there with Mr. Gibb Gilchrist, we had no 
chancellor's system. Describe him. Mr.

05:44.028 --> 06:05.275
Gilchrist

05:44.028 --> 06:05.275
was an engineer, graduated the University of 
Texas in 1909, was a state highway engineer prior

05:44.028 --> 06:05.275
to his coming here, and in the mid-30s he was 
brought here as Dean of Engineering. He was a very

06:06.657 --> 06:10.862
fine, tough administrator. He was a very good man, 
though there are a lot of people that might

06:12.277 --> 06:19.245
disagree with me a little bit. He was an 
outstanding college administrator. And

06:25.433 --> 06:38.047
conducted a real, ran a real good show here as long 
as he was president and then continued as

06:25.433 --> 06:38.047
chancellor. The chancellorship organization 
was his idea. And the chancellor system was put

06:42.905 --> 06:48.793
into effect in 1948.

06:51.056 --> 06:57.465
And Mr. Gilchrist became the first chancellor of 
the A&M system. And when he became chancellor in

06:57.485 --> 07:12.726
1948, the longtime dean of Bolton, we called him 
Bear Tracks, became president. the Gilchrist

07:13.229 --> 07:22.137
lived in the old, to you and me, President's House 
over near Sabeasa? Yes, yes. All right, and then

07:25.720 --> 07:32.787
when the chancellorship was created, the White 
House down near the core area? Yes. Okay. Moved

07:34.548 --> 07:38.472
into what, what did we call that house? I forgot, 
but Anyway, when he became Chancellor, he moved in

07:42.946 --> 07:48.134
that White House.

07:51.479 --> 07:58.209
Mr. Bolton, I don't recall if Mr. Bolton ever moved 
in the old, what's called, President's Home. I

07:58.229 --> 08:00.533
guess he did. As president, Gilchrist office, his 
office was in the, what you and I used to call the

08:00.732 --> 08:09.706
system administration building facing east. 
Yes, in the system building. And he remained, his

08:11.609 --> 08:14.914
office remained there as chancellor. Yes. Where 
did President Bolton's office? President

08:19.140 --> 08:23.046
Bolton, when was the Koch building built? I don't 
know. Richard Koch building.

08:34.415 --> 08:42.086
I'm trying to think of a

08:34.415 --> 08:42.086
minute. I, as I remember now, I'd have to go back to 
the date of the, I'll check that in a minute, when

08:42.246 --> 08:52.821
the coat building was built.

08:54.643 --> 09:00.912
I'm going to say that Dean Bolton was in the coat 
building provided that building was at that time

09:01.415 --> 09:04.540
built. This, remember, was 1948 to 1950. There was 
no Memorial Student Center, and I have a feeling

09:09.869 --> 09:18.003
there was no boat building at that time. Mr. 
Bolton's office

09:18.104 --> 09:26.578
would have been in one of the engineering 
buildings as dean of engineering. And he may have

09:27.588 --> 09:37.605
stayed in that building for a while as president. 
Describe, in the late 40s, describe the campus

09:37.625 --> 09:43.355
physically. What buildings were where? The 
campus in 1947 to 1950, its parameter was the

09:55.398 --> 09:59.664
Administration building, we called it, on the 
east gate. And the west gate was the railroad

09:59.685 --> 10:04.111
station. And to the south was Old Jersey Street. 
And to the north gate was the North Gate. And

10:14.988 --> 10:19.735
anything to the west of the campus was very rural. 
few residential areas on the south side of the

10:21.790 --> 10:25.493
campus. The north side of the campus was the old 
North Gate, which was the business section of

10:26.675 --> 10:36.264
College Station at the time. The East Gate was a few 
residences built there in the late 30s and not much

10:38.105 --> 10:47.314
more. A few apartments had been moved in from old 
air bases and army bases and converted to branch

10:51.676 --> 11:01.227
student housing. And they were called College 
View. And it was on the area where they now have new

11:04.190 --> 11:10.337
student apartments. And we were in very short 
supply of branch student housing because most of

11:12.119 --> 11:19.067
the veterans, a lot of the veterans, came back 
after the war, 46, 47, 48, were married, needed

11:20.093 --> 11:30.406
housing. They converted all the old project 
houses, which were located on the south side, into

11:30.426 --> 11:38.436
apartments. And they had four apartments in each 
of those buildings, so they provided some

11:38.456 --> 11:43.542
housing. Were there any trailers? Yes, there were 
trailers. All around the old project houses where

11:47.785 --> 11:52.710
students lived. Where athletic facilities are 
now. Where athletic facilities are now, yes. Who

11:58.335 --> 12:05.102
were some of the leading personalities on the 
campus at that time? Leading personalities.

12:08.305 --> 12:15.312
Well, of course,

12:08.305 --> 12:15.312
Spike White. and his bunch of student activities 
were very active. Mr. Penberg was, or was named,

12:22.962 --> 12:29.850
Dean of England. He was active. Then in the core, 
what little core we had in those days was much more

12:31.953 --> 12:42.666
than it is now because it was still ushered for 
incoming students. was Colonel Stan Malloy, who

12:43.827 --> 12:50.597
was a commandant. Joe Davis, who was a major, 
worked for Colonel Malloy. And then there were

13:01.033 --> 13:12.450
attack officers like Taylor Wilkins, Charles 
Taylor,

13:15.434 --> 13:21.761
Howard Perry,

13:15.434 --> 13:21.761
Roy Buchek at one time. And many people of that 
nature had been in the service and came out and were

13:23.123 --> 13:31.793
employed as track officers. The football team was 
coached by Coach Homer Norton, whose contract was

13:32.134 --> 13:45.289
bought up after the A&M Rice football game in the 
fall of 1947. I can tell you about that if you're

13:45.995 --> 13:48.998
interested. Oh,

13:49.939 --> 13:53.343
yes. When our better football players went into 
the service in 1941, 42, 43, Coach Norton promised

13:53.363 --> 14:12.745
those boys that went into the service a 
scholarship, athletic scholarship when they

13:53.363 --> 14:12.745
came back. Well, when the war was over, most of 
those young men had not gotten a degree. So they

14:19.965 --> 14:29.417
came back to Indiana and they wanted their 
athletic scholarship and Coach Norton gave them

14:19.965 --> 14:29.417
the scholarship. And they attempted to play 
football, but they weren't as good athletically

14:29.437 --> 14:37.447
as they had been before the war. But Coach Norton, 
for his credit, honored his work and gave every one

14:37.467 --> 14:42.613
of those players, former players, and their 
scholarships. As a result, he was limited as to the

14:46.546 --> 14:54.897
number of new scholarships he could afford. As a 
result, he was not

14:54.917 --> 15:05.349
able to win the games with the alumni and others 
that perhaps thought that he should win. In the

15:05.369 --> 15:10.896
fall of 47, which was my first year back, we were 
having trouble winning games. and using a lot of

15:12.496 --> 15:14.319
those old veterans. So

15:16.123 --> 15:26.842
the alumni started becoming unrestful about it. 
We made rice in Houston that fall. And as I recall,

15:33.835 --> 15:36.900
the store was something like 37 to 12, 37 to 14, 
something like that. It was a one-sided story in

15:43.033 --> 15:48.201
favor of Bryce. After the game, my wife and I and 
Quillen and his wife went to a cocktail party in

15:49.823 --> 16:02.802
Houston, and present were some of the staunch Big 
Aggies like T.F. Smith, T.W. Moley, Jake Hamlin,

16:07.930 --> 16:24.996
George G. Smith, and there was a rumble at that 
party that night about Norton and his head

16:07.930 --> 16:24.996
coaching position. This was a Saturday night 
afternoon. The following Monday, the Houston A&M

16:28.181 --> 16:35.592
Club met every Monday at noon at the Rice Hotel. And 
at that meeting, there was a rumble about buying up

16:37.073 --> 16:43.860
Coach Norton's contract. As I recall, he had about 
$20,000 of contract left. That, I think,

16:48.104 --> 16:55.191
represented two years of coaching, about $10,000 
a year. So at that meeting,

16:55.211 --> 17:02.018
there was a motion to start the ball rolling to buy 
up those gardens contracts without any clearance

17:02.825 --> 17:10.894
from the university or anybody else. That's just 
the way that things happened in those days. Well,

17:14.619 --> 17:27.834
anyway, Mr. Travis Smith, who was class of 98, 
stood up and said, if you boys are serious about

17:14.619 --> 17:27.834
this matter, I'll match you dollar for dollar. 
Every dollar you can raise here, I'll just match.

17:32.761 --> 17:38.769
As a result, the ball got to Roland. And Mr. Smith 
did honor his situation. Whatever was raised at

17:42.634 --> 18:01.958
that meeting, I don't remember the figure, but it 
was not $20,000, more like $4,000 or $5,000 raised

17:42.634 --> 18:01.958
by the membership of the club, matched by Mr. 
Smith's money, and then the rest was raised by

17:42.634 --> 18:01.958
Dallas and Fort Worth and Beaumont. And that's the 
way the matter was raised, where they paid for his

18:02.967 --> 18:13.580
contract and they gave him his money and paid him 
off. And Mr. Norton took it very well, though he was

18:13.600 --> 18:32.923
disappointed of course, but he did accept the 
money and resigned his position and went to

18:13.600 --> 18:32.923
Galveston, Texas and bought a a motel in 
Galveston. And Harry Styler had been brought here

18:38.278 --> 18:43.305
as an assistant to Coach Martin. And the Athletic 
Council, then after that happened, named Coach

18:43.325 --> 18:52.516
Harry Styler as head football coach. As far as you 
know, was there any effort by the campus

18:52.536 --> 19:00.966
administration to prevent, to stop this or 
anything? Not that I heard of it. Not that I know of.

19:04.079 --> 19:11.188
And the then called Board of Directors, now 
Regents, they were not involved particularly.

19:11.228 --> 19:16.255
They were not involved particularly, nor was the 
administration who had been Mr. Gibb and Gail

19:11.228 --> 19:16.255
Christie. Now we did have an athletic director at 
that time who was Mr. Carmichael, Bill

19:17.236 --> 19:28.611
Carmichael.

19:29.823 --> 19:33.047
Mr. Carmichael had an athletic council, as they do 
now. And after all this happened, Mr. Norton's

19:33.447 --> 19:42.238
contract was paid up. Then the athletic council 
sat down and decided they were going to employ as a

19:42.258 --> 19:48.645
head coach. And they employed Harry Steinway, who 
was here to be our head coach. And that was

19:53.431 --> 19:59.138
his first season would have been. the year 48, and 
he posted 48, 49, and 50. And then you'll remember

20:04.435 --> 20:13.909
the problems that Coach Tyler got into, and he was 
terminated then. His position here was

20:13.929 --> 20:25.906
terminated sometime in the year, early in the year 
51.

20:25.926 --> 20:27.489
And I'll tell you that story. Go ahead, yes, go 
ahead. It

20:29.189 --> 20:49.347
was customary for the Houston A&M Club to have a 
banquet each year for the football team and their

20:29.189 --> 20:49.347
girlfriends and all the coaches, and that was held 
in the Shamrock Hotel, which was pretty new, just

20:29.189 --> 20:49.347
having opened in 1949. Well, the year 19 would have 
been the banquet for the team of 1950. The banquet

20:59.767 --> 21:05.174
was held, I think, in January of the year 51. Coach 
Stiler had been in Dallas for a meeting, and he was

21:05.194 --> 21:17.349
to fly from Dallas to Houston. Mr. Ford Munderland 
was on the plane. Mr. Munderland was an executive

21:19.492 --> 21:24.979
with the American General Life Insurance 
Company. Had been a professor here at A&M. They

21:27.622 --> 21:28.423
flew together. same plane from Dallas to Houston 
airport. Upon arrival at Houston airport, Ford

21:34.573 --> 21:41.400
invited Harry to ride with him to the Shamrock 
Hotel.

21:44.102 --> 21:52.530
But when they arrived and got off the airplane, 
somebody was there to meet Harry Steiner. And this

21:52.550 --> 21:59.676
person that was meeting Harry insisted that Harry 
go with him to ride to the Shamrock Hotel. So he did,

22:03.337 --> 22:10.863
and Mr. Munden went by himself to the Shamrock 
Hotel. The banquet was delayed and delayed and

22:10.883 --> 22:13.546
delayed. They wouldn't start, they wouldn't 
start, they wouldn't start. Finally, word

22:17.029 --> 22:22.353
started around that Coach Tyler had been 
assaulted.

22:26.877 --> 22:28.819
Rumor had it that Well, all kinds of groups, of all 
sorts of descriptions. But it later developed

22:35.410 --> 22:57.220
that Coach Steiner had been seen on the side of the 
wife of this ex-woman

22:35.410 --> 22:57.220
and this young lady that worked at

22:35.410 --> 22:57.220
the athletic department. husband just 
thoroughly gave Coach Snyder a good beating. And

23:05.733 --> 23:11.919
then put him in the car and took him to Shamrock and 
let him out there in the garage. And Harry went to

23:11.939 --> 23:21.750
the garage and went into the restroom and went to 
the telephone and called the trainer, Bill

23:11.939 --> 23:21.750
Dayton. Bill Dayton came to the garage and tried to 
fix Harry up and pretty badly beat him. And then

23:28.587 --> 23:44.564
took him to a motel, I don't know what it's called, 
it was out on the water drive, Buck Road, Buck Road

23:28.587 --> 23:44.564
Motel, Buck Road Inn, I don't know, around that 
area. And this is a real

23:44.584 --> 23:57.177
long story, but to make it brief, when all this 
happened, Mr. D.W. Williams was actually the

23:44.584 --> 23:57.177
president. Mr. Williams investigated the case 
and Coach Steidler denied knowing who assaulted

23:59.333 --> 24:16.853
him and would not admit knowing anything about who 
this person was. Mr. Williams, as I understood,

24:16.873 --> 24:27.585
had an agreement with Steidler that if anything 
ever came out that he did know the person

24:28.004 --> 24:41.918
who saw it, then

24:28.004 --> 24:41.918
the administration would have had his immediate 
resignation. Well, this, what happened, one of

24:41.938 --> 24:55.332
the Houston newspapers, I don't believe it's in 
existence now, but one of the Houston newspapers

24:41.938 --> 24:55.332
put an investigative reporter on the case and 
found out the whole story. And they called Coach

24:55.352 --> 24:56.593
Stider to Houston. said,

24:58.109 --> 25:21.253
apologize, but we're running this story the next 
day. But he could do nothing but apologize. And it

25:22.054 --> 25:22.855
was run on pay to get an apology. His daughter came 
back to campus and went to Mr. Williams' office and

25:22.875 --> 25:25.058
told him the whole story. And that was the end of the 
story. And it was very unfortunate, but it And then

25:29.395 --> 25:40.386
he's followed by... Coach Styler had brought in an 
outstanding guy from California. He was the most

25:40.406 --> 25:44.610
lovable person that you could ever imagine. Was 
Harry's line coach. And his name was Ray

25:46.953 --> 25:51.457
George. Ray George was named head coach. coached 
the 51, 52, and 53. And

26:00.168 --> 26:12.525
he was just such a nice guy that he just wasn't tough 
enough to be a head coach. And he, that year, 51, he

26:12.745 --> 26:21.397
beat Texas here on Powell Hill, 42-21 in the great 
game. And by that time, Dr. Harrington was

26:25.420 --> 26:33.611
president

26:25.420 --> 26:33.611
and they declared a holiday after that victory. So 
then it was Ray George who served through the year

26:35.313 --> 26:52.575
1953 and there was unrest with Ray's ability to 
coach and so forth. So they terminated Ray,

26:53.197 --> 27:11.188
and they had a big search

26:53.197 --> 27:11.188
for a replacement for Ray, which was a rather 
unfortunate experience, I think that's what

26:53.197 --> 27:11.188
happened. Maybe that was after Bear Bryant left in 
57. But anyway, they employed him. Dr. Harrington

27:18.577 --> 27:21.601
and Mr. W.T. Daugherty was, I think, the president 
of the board of directors then, persuaded Coach

27:21.641 --> 27:31.515
Bryant to meet him in Dallas in a hotel room. And 
they offered him the job as athletic director and

27:33.417 --> 27:41.027
head coach at Andy in 54. Never discussed salary or 
anything. He took the job on a handshake and came to

27:46.707 --> 27:59.565
A&M as athletic director

27:46.707 --> 27:59.565
and head coach. And you'll remember that great 
history that Bear Bryant had here. What was he like

28:03.450 --> 28:07.616
to work with for a person in your position?

28:10.140 --> 28:14.706
Bear Bryant was not easy to work with. He was a 
little bit difficult to work with. I did work with

28:20.948 --> 28:35.263
Bear, but Bear had to be told if he was going to do 
something that we were not accustomed to doing, he

28:20.948 --> 28:35.263
would have to be told we don't do that and tell him 
why. And once he understood why you didn't want to

28:36.124 --> 28:44.693
do something that he wanted to do, and he 
understood why we didn't, then he went along with

28:36.124 --> 28:44.693
it. But he was not a real easy person to deal with, 
because he had his own ideas of how he wanted things

28:45.584 --> 28:59.177
done. And he came here without knowing much about 
the traditions of A&M, the real traditions of A&M.

29:06.544 --> 29:09.988
He knew athletics, and he knew it well. He'd been in 
Maryland, he'd been in Kentucky, and I assume

29:15.858 --> 29:24.388
Alabama, and he knew how they did things, which 
were not exactly like we did. For example, he

29:24.468 --> 29:28.153
wanted to have a big homecoming. And he talked to me 
about having a big homecoming. And I said, Barron,

29:32.498 --> 29:36.783
we consider every home game a homecoming. And we 
have class reunions and so forth on every home

29:38.165 --> 29:42.871
game. We don't want homecomings. We won't ever get 
him to be a homecoming. But all right, if that's the

29:48.425 --> 29:50.667
way it is. And he went along with that. But

29:53.811 --> 30:00.258
Bear was a loner. He didn't come in here with a big 
band and a big ball of rock. He came in here to do one

30:05.224 --> 30:10.450
job, have a good football game. And that was his 
mission. That was his purpose. And he worked night

30:14.034 --> 30:15.295
and day. He worked hard. He was an outstanding 
recruiter, but he didn't want anybody's advice

30:19.180 --> 30:25.707
how to do it. He knew how to do it. And he stayed with 
his program. He recruited players that he could

30:32.475 --> 30:35.858
win with. And he would go to A&M meetings, but he 
would not let any alumni affairs interfere with

30:46.662 --> 30:52.974
his main primary job, coaching the football team. 
Now did he ask you and the former student

30:52.994 --> 30:57.983
leadership to do anything for him? Yes. Yes, he 
did. As a matter of fact, when we were put on

31:03.974 --> 31:08.603
probation,

31:15.738 --> 31:19.362
would have been in 54 or 55. Our association of 
former student council was in session. And he

31:24.507 --> 31:33.456
asked if he could appear before the group,

31:24.507 --> 31:33.456
and he said certainly, come right here. And his 
opening statement was, when the going gets tough

31:33.476 --> 31:42.285
and tough, and he outlined the probation
