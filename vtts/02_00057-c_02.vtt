WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:11.781
We've got to educate a lot more folks or we're going to cut our feet out from under us.

00:11.801 --> 00:25.279
Is there anything you can think of we could and what A&M has been doing that we don't need to do anymore and are there some new things we ought to be doing or some different emphases?

00:29.208 --> 00:33.574
Well, I think we need to put more emphasis on character building.

00:34.896 --> 00:39.862
We talk a big story about Honesty and the Honor Code at A&M, but it's rather hollow at times.

00:40.904 --> 00:42.285
I've seen it firsthand.

00:43.247 --> 00:44.789
I agree with you.

00:44.809 --> 00:46.471
And we make a big talk about that.

00:46.571 --> 00:49.094
And I used to make little speeches.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.239
I hear a lot about leadership, but I don't hear much about character.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.105
And Ray Bowen has picked up on character.

00:57.203 --> 00:58.626
I applaud him for that.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.151
I think it's an area that we've got to do a lot more on.

01:01.932 --> 01:07.042
I think the alcohol problem here is something that, it's a real tough one.

01:08.204 --> 01:14.597
But it's, we're not a lot different to most other schools, but alcohol is a problem.

01:15.819 --> 01:19.887
And the core, I never saw drugs as much of a problem over there.

01:20.305 --> 01:27.759
I think they have a way of kind of assuring that drugs don't become a major factor there.

01:27.799 --> 01:32.868
Not that there haven't been some, but alcohol is a major, major problem.

01:35.774 --> 01:39.981
In some areas A&M does pretty good here, football games for example.

01:40.723 --> 01:43.107
Our crowds, I'm so proud of them.

01:43.205 --> 01:48.550
After the ball game, you can leave when we've beaten or lost a tough opponent.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.133
Say we win big.

01:51.613 --> 01:55.137
I don't hear the boasting and carrying on that I hear at other places.

01:55.797 --> 02:00.662
I remember going to LSU a few years ago, and that was, golly, such a disappointment.

02:01.182 --> 02:09.010
I've never seen such an unruly crowd, and I thought, my, I'm glad we're not in this mode.

02:09.563 --> 02:13.287
You know, they start celebrating on Thursday and everybody gets drunk before the game.

02:14.808 --> 02:17.251
But I see some of that trying to creep in here.

02:18.392 --> 02:23.877
And there are people who think you've got to have alcohol at everything or you can't be a success.

02:23.897 --> 02:24.878
You can't raise money.

02:24.938 --> 02:29.463
You can't do this if you don't have alcohol at all these things.

02:29.543 --> 02:34.988
But again, our crowds are the most mature crowds I've seen at football games.

02:35.008 --> 02:37.731
That says something very good about A&M.

02:37.711 --> 02:39.976
There's not a lot of drinking.

02:40.437 --> 02:41.559
I'm not saying there's none.

02:41.860 --> 02:42.441
There probably is.

02:42.862 --> 02:45.869
There is, I know, but not like at other places.

02:47.151 --> 02:54.046
But how we do that, now I've argued that we ought to be alcohol free on campus in the dorms and all.

02:54.808 --> 02:58.015
I think we ought to take a stand, but that's a big step.

02:58.197 --> 03:00.940
That's one thing I think we might want to do.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.462
Some schools have that today.

03:02.962 --> 03:07.407
But, you know, we're having some alcohol-free floors and dorms and all.

03:07.507 --> 03:10.530
I think that's a good move, but it's going to be a tough one.

03:11.131 --> 03:16.516
But the alcohol thing is pretty far out of control.

03:21.762 --> 03:24.525
Some of the traditions

03:26.243 --> 03:30.049
can get carried too far, in my opinion.

03:31.471 --> 03:32.373
Tradition is good.

03:32.653 --> 03:47.516
If you don't have some other guide, it's a pretty good thing to stick with, and it does build a lot of positive things, but tradition carried too far can be a negative thing, and I've seen that in the core.

03:49.119 --> 03:54.327
Tradition gets ahead of integrity, and I say there's no

03:55.235 --> 03:56.176
It's not even close.

03:57.277 --> 03:59.620
Integrity comes before tradition.

04:00.400 --> 04:06.747
But, you know, how we balance all that is a real $24 question.

04:06.807 --> 04:10.751
I think Dr. Bowen has done a good job with doing all of that.

04:11.332 --> 04:13.234
And some of it you go along with.

04:13.334 --> 04:21.222
And another thing that I would tell people, you got to remember, you got to think like an 18-year-old does sometimes.

04:21.322 --> 04:24.786
And as older people, we have a very hard time doing that.

04:25.357 --> 04:32.631
I've seen it in the core that, you know, what they're interested in and what motivates them and all these little traditions do.

04:34.195 --> 04:37.982
So, you know, I think they're, you got to recognize that.

04:39.329 --> 04:50.349
But my only concern is that over the traditions is that sometimes they're carried to an extreme and they become negative and things get out of priority.

04:50.769 --> 05:02.991
The bonfire, there's a lot of positives with the bonfire, but I've seen enough negatives that it concerns me that, you know, we got to keep some perspective and balance in that.

05:04.456 --> 05:22.498
If you could make a major gift to A&M, somebody shows up and hands you a check for a huge amount of money and it's to be passed on to A&M, but you decide what it's to be used for, what would it be?

05:23.660 --> 05:35.094
Well, that's interesting since I'm in fundraising and I've had a, not maybe the size you're talking about, but I've had some people contact me and say, you know, where can we put this?

05:35.174 --> 05:39.580
Well, I'm working primarily for the Corps and scholarships is the thing that I've.

05:39.780 --> 05:41.502
But if you were deciding.

05:41.863 --> 05:42.564
If I was the president?

05:42.624 --> 05:43.244
No, no, no.

05:43.264 --> 05:44.927
If I were the president?

05:45.047 --> 05:45.868
Oh, if I'm the giver.

05:46.028 --> 05:46.629
You're the giver.

05:47.009 --> 05:47.610
Yeah.

05:47.630 --> 05:48.531
Where would you put it?

05:48.591 --> 05:49.072
At A&M?

05:49.773 --> 05:51.274
What would you want it used for?

05:51.315 --> 05:52.536
Hmm.

05:57.815 --> 06:03.702
Well, again, you know, it'd be based on my past experiences and interest and all.

06:03.762 --> 06:12.253
And with my background and interest, I would like to see there's a thing we've been working on here lately.

06:12.293 --> 06:16.798
I've been involved for eight long years now trying to move this thing forward.

06:16.818 --> 06:20.503
And it's a leadership enhancement program for the Corps.

06:22.125 --> 06:23.907
And it's a vision that

06:25.000 --> 06:31.850
some of us have had for a long time that would really upgrade the quality of leadership and character training in the core.

06:32.551 --> 06:41.784
It put leadership on a very formal, structured basis where the structures are all trained, they have lessons plans, they have training aids.

06:42.305 --> 06:44.709
It's not, Joe, go over there and teach ethics today.

06:46.030 --> 06:54.062
There's something much beyond that that might even offer you some kind of credential when you're through.

06:54.616 --> 07:02.686
that you've done something in the leadership area that makes you a little better qualified than the average graduate.

07:04.087 --> 07:16.703
But a leadership endowment here, we're looking at eight to ten million dollars for such a program that would have a head that's got academic credentials.

07:17.584 --> 07:20.387
It's got broad respect across the board.

07:20.873 --> 07:24.266
You know, that's the kind of program we've kind of been dreaming about for a while.

07:24.407 --> 07:29.466
And if I could find one big donor to give to that, I'd be tickled pink.

07:30.425 --> 07:36.211
And you're inferring if you had the capability, you would be proud to be.

07:36.711 --> 07:36.851
Yeah.

07:37.492 --> 07:41.176
I think scholarships are great too, endowed scholarships.

07:42.097 --> 07:51.586
And my experience with donors, there's nothing that tickles their fancy more than scholarships because there's a student on the other end that they can relate to.

07:51.947 --> 07:53.789
It's not like bricks and mortar.

07:53.809 --> 07:54.069
That's right.

07:54.089 --> 07:57.192
Programs that are vague.

07:58.319 --> 08:06.411
Looking back on your student years, to whom are you most grateful for what you learned during those years?

08:09.756 --> 08:10.757
What people?

08:14.683 --> 08:16.345
At A&M you're talking about?

08:18.603 --> 08:22.428
Well, you know, people I've already named, I guess, are the key ones.

08:24.090 --> 08:27.114
But there were other professors that I felt very good about.

08:30.418 --> 08:32.221
But J.R.

08:32.241 --> 08:43.275
Jackson would have been my number one person that had a— He was in ag— He was ag ed.

08:43.355 --> 08:47.040
He was an ag ed professor.

08:48.134 --> 09:01.297
You know, I didn't know him personally, but he was a guy that ran this basic division program that I thought he did a good job.

09:02.820 --> 09:05.445
It helped get me straightened out in a lot of ways.

09:07.989 --> 09:11.155
Coaches, you know.

09:14.898 --> 09:25.751
I really, you know, wouldn't single out as one of those, but there's got to be other folks that I could list here.

09:25.771 --> 09:27.073
I'd have to think about it a little bit.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.517
We can get that when we get this typed up.

09:31.498 --> 09:37.826
I've got one more question other than have we left out any major topics from your student years?

09:39.248 --> 09:39.608
Let's see.

09:39.649 --> 09:40.810
I thought of one a moment ago.

09:40.870 --> 09:41.611
Now, let me see.

09:41.671 --> 09:42.492
What was it?

09:50.352 --> 09:55.097
Because I gather from you that it was a comparatively straight path.

09:55.417 --> 10:05.267
You didn't have any big waverings and there were no major tragedies either personally or during, to the campus during that time.

10:06.448 --> 10:06.688
No.

10:06.949 --> 10:16.358
You didn't have to turn around and go in another direction and there wasn't much money but yet you were still able to proceed.

10:17.179 --> 10:19.161
Didn't have to drop out or anything like that.

10:20.930 --> 10:26.059
Let's go ahead and do the last one then for, this is what I end with with everyone.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.965
What feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M today?

10:31.087 --> 10:33.471
How do you feel about this place?

10:33.491 --> 10:34.253
Very good.

10:36.136 --> 10:45.171
And I think a good example, I don't want anything negative, bad happening to A&M or A&M people.

10:45.291 --> 10:46.954
It tears me apart.

10:47.677 --> 10:49.820
when I see bad things happening.

10:49.900 --> 10:50.942
I'm so proud of it.

10:51.943 --> 10:56.710
I want it to be good and everything about it good.

10:57.851 --> 11:05.422
That's not gonna be, I know, but when incidents and bad problems come up, I'm disturbed by that.

11:07.084 --> 11:11.790
Only because I love the place so much and want it to be so good.

11:15.616 --> 11:17.278
But, you know,

11:18.980 --> 11:44.539
I've had plenty of opportunity to talk about A&M over my years and I always try to put a very positive spin on everything I'm talking about A&M and I talk with pride to other people about it and, you know, we've got some weak links and problems but there's plenty of good here.

11:45.421 --> 11:46.182
Let's quit on that.

11:46.202 --> 11:46.843
That's great.
