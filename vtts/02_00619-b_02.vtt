00:01.567 --> 00:13.507
The laboratories

00:01.567 --> 00:13.507
are smack right in the middle of the ship on the main 
deck and you get exactly the same kind of

00:01.567 --> 00:13.507
treatment. If this were a commercial vessel that 
would be the engine room and the wells above the

00:13.527 --> 00:22.022
engine room and you'd be working in the bow or the 
stern.

00:22.525 --> 00:27.851
And it's awfully nice when people come back from a 
cruise and say, what a wonderful vessel this is.

00:27.891 --> 00:32.857
Well, the reason it's a wonderful vessel is it was 
built from scratch as an oceanographic vessel.

00:32.878 --> 00:41.488
And a lot of care and experience went into placing 
the various units, placing priorities on space

00:32.878 --> 00:41.488
and things like that. And when you begin to design a 
vessel that you go through and say, we have to have

00:41.508 --> 00:46.053
these X number of things. We have to have trawls, 
for example. We have to have nets. And we put these

00:49.818 --> 00:51.520
here. But if you have to... What you do is you get 
your scientists together, and it takes a period of

00:52.107 --> 01:03.817
maybe a year or maybe even longer, and you just 
thrash out one item at a time. Everything is a

01:05.058 --> 01:06.099
compromise. One fellow wants one thing, somebody 
else wants something else, and you eventually,

01:06.139 --> 01:17.769
through persuasion and argument, come up with a 
compromise in each unit. When we got the Wacoma...

01:21.098 --> 01:22.600
It was a stripped vessel. It wasn't even 
completed. And we spent about $850,000

01:24.322 --> 01:29.648
outfitting it with the scientific equipment and 
gear. And it took a lot of heartache to decide how to

01:30.809 --> 01:39.960
spend these resources because one person wants 
this and somebody else wants something

01:30.809 --> 01:39.960
different. And every lab goes through the same 
sort of thing. Now, do you check on its progress

01:42.944 --> 01:45.186
almost each day? Do you stay beside it, or do you 
just? No, the architect does this? We have our own

01:50.068 --> 01:52.912
clerk of the works that usually does this. We 
usually have an engineer that is right there all

01:53.192 --> 01:55.636
the time. What about a ship's captain? How do you 
decide and pick that? Well, we don't have to very

02:01.405 --> 02:06.613
often because we still have the captain that... 
One of our captains has been with us about 15 years

02:07.775 --> 02:14.681
now, and the other one's been since we got the first 
big ship. He came aboard, we'd had it for about two

02:14.701 --> 02:19.906
months, and he's been with us, and this has been 12 
or 13 years. We do not have a very big overturn in our

02:21.668 --> 02:27.193
ship's officers, and they tend to stay.

02:30.015 --> 02:36.381
Most of them live in Newport and have families, and 
almost all of our crews are ex-combatants.

02:37.002 --> 02:39.126
service people rather than from the merchant 
marine. And I think they tend to be a little more,

02:39.227 --> 02:50.170
well, they like a home life a little bit more than 
the merchant mariners do. How often, how many days

02:50.190 --> 02:53.256
per year are you out to sea in your ship? Am I 
personally? No. The ship is usually out in about

02:55.975 --> 03:00.264
250 days, the big ship and about 175 for the little 
one. It just got back from six months off South

03:01.546 --> 03:04.492
America. It left on the 10th of January and got back 
on the 3rd of July. And then I take it you take crews

03:09.233 --> 03:12.178
out and back. That is, people will be on it about six 
weeks, be replaced by others, or will somebody

03:12.198 --> 03:16.866
spend six months on that vessel? The crew spends 
six months. We have a rule that we can't keep them

03:18.529 --> 03:23.457
longer than that without shipping them home for 
two weeks. So we tend to take a long cruise every

03:23.477 --> 03:26.422
other year. We work locally on cruises not more 
than two months long, maybe go to Hawaii or Alaska,

03:27.985 --> 03:34.836
but then every other year we plan a long cruise. 
usually split up into four or five parts, and a

03:36.385 --> 03:42.073
different group goes and exchanges.

03:45.318 --> 03:50.185
We had chemists part of the time, geologists, 
geophysicists, and physical people were our last

03:45.318 --> 03:50.185
group.

03:54.531 --> 04:05.447
And does it seem to you, this is a fair question, 
does it seem to you there are less tensions between

03:54.531 --> 04:05.447
crews and ships and so forth now than there were 
when you first started? Less tensions? Less

04:06.562 --> 04:07.944
tension, yes. Between being at sea longer, having 
crowded ships, or what? Conditions were pretty

04:16.579 --> 04:18.903
primitive when I started out. We started out in EWS 
Scripps, which is about 100 feet long.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.297
Had a crew of about five people. It was really kind 
of dangerous. I'm surprised we didn't lose

04:28.980 --> 04:31.384
ourselves. And then we moved up to the first of the 
Revell fleet, the old Baird and Horizon. They

04:35.748 --> 04:39.334
really weren't very comfortable. Diesel fumes 
all the time, and quarters were right up in the bow,

04:40.776 --> 04:48.008
and you were seasick most of the time. And now our 
ships are much more comfortable.

04:54.238 --> 04:57.743
How long did you stay on those first cruises? As a 
rule, most ships, this is just a general number,

04:58.195 --> 05:06.706
can't stay at sea for more than about six weeks at 
the most. And this is about the maximum that people

05:07.306 --> 05:11.251
put up with each other, too. If they're out that 
long, then they're all at each other's throats,

05:11.652 --> 05:15.977
crew and size. So the normal leg is about a month 
long, for us at any rate. And I think this is true for

05:21.925 --> 05:23.987
most of the other labs. They tend to work for a month 
and then come into a port. OK. And plan the cruise

05:29.667 --> 05:31.510
this way. Right.

05:37.981 --> 05:39.464
Get my 15 second delay here.

05:42.869 --> 05:46.916
Now we were talking really about outfitting ships 
and time spent at sea. And you had explained that

05:47.858 --> 05:52.165
the staff remained about the same all the time and 
that that after a certain amount of time at sea,

05:52.347 --> 05:59.117
usually a month, that the tensions increased 
enough where you thought you had to come back to

05:52.347 --> 05:59.117
port. Is this...

06:02.902 --> 06:03.303
Excuse me. Is there anything else you would like to 
add about vessels, outfitting vessels? I don't

06:10.353 --> 06:13.097
think so, unless you have a specific question. No, 
the next series of questions I have concern...

06:17.255 --> 06:22.643
curriculum, really, when you arrived here and 
established your department. Was there any

06:23.204 --> 06:29.673
particular weakness you thought that appeared in 
oceanography as a whole that you tried to aim your

06:23.204 --> 06:29.673
department towards? Well, I've been a little bit 
insistent on one point, and that is that no matter

06:31.816 --> 06:46.637
what branch of oceanography a student goes in, he 
has to take the fundamental four basic courses in

06:31.816 --> 06:46.637
biology, chemistry, geology, and physical 
oceanography. And that is not generally held in

06:47.360 --> 06:57.615
most places, but I feel that anybody that's 
working in the ocean, it ought to have at least

06:47.360 --> 06:57.615
knowledge of some of the literature and 
nomenclature in all fields. And so beside this,

06:57.635 --> 07:01.761
you had no particular design or goal for the 
curriculum? No, not in particular. Of course, I

07:04.145 --> 07:07.430
came from Scripps, so I designed it pretty much 
after what I'd seen then. Okay.

07:11.295 --> 07:14.380
Scripps, like the University of Oregon, or like 
Oregon State, excuse me, in our university seems

07:14.680 --> 07:20.026
to stress research probably more than some of the 
other institutions. Do you suppose that's why

07:20.507 --> 07:25.133
that you stressed research more here, or was it 
more simply funding? I think it was funding,

07:27.455 --> 07:30.259
primarily, that gave us the stress there. But we 
have not neglected our educational side at all. I

07:35.285 --> 07:39.049
think we have perhaps as many students as anyone. 
We have about 120 students and put a lot of effort

07:39.069 --> 07:43.675
into it. I just wanted to make sure we got that point 
down on tape. Now, I only really have two or three

07:49.980 --> 07:55.385
more questions then, and this is a different kind 
of nature of things.

07:58.128 --> 08:00.371
Perhaps again speculative questions if you would 
like. Do you suppose that now that it seems as if

08:02.493 --> 08:09.460
oceanography and meteorology are more 
intertwined than ever before, Do you suppose

08:09.862 --> 08:20.936
there will be more chances for oceanography to 
perhaps tie itself up in joint projects with NASA

08:09.862 --> 08:20.936
and these sorts of projects in terms of weather 
predicting? Do you see more interest? I don't

08:23.419 --> 08:24.340
really see. I've

08:24.360 --> 08:30.789
never thought about this, but I don't see any real 
prospect. There have only been a few teams where

08:31.049 --> 08:35.835
both are on it. The meteorologists seem to be a 
little independent of the oceanographers.

08:40.521 --> 08:41.682
That's perfect. There have been several 
complaints, I know, among people working in the

08:41.982 --> 08:48.871
atmosphere and the ocean about the lack of 
cooperation between two groups. Have you felt

08:49.812 --> 08:52.255
this has limited you in your career? No. Not any at 
all? I don't think so, because I consider myself a

08:54.638 --> 08:57.341
meteorologist. I'm a fellow of the American 
Meteorological Society. I've been on their

08:59.524 --> 09:02.527
boards and committees, and I just work in both 
fields. Okay. But a person without this training

09:04.267 --> 09:06.931
might not feel free to do this. Now, is there 
anything you'd like to add to the table? What have I

09:12.140 --> 09:12.761
missed? I think you've done a pretty thorough job.

09:19.752 --> 09:22.838
I don't think I have any particular message for 
posterity. No, you can think of nothing you'd like

09:23.198 --> 09:25.782
to say to future historians. No, not in 
particular. I think the primary ingredient of

09:31.233 --> 09:36.851
success in any field is just plain hard work, and I 
think that shows. And that's just what you would

09:37.954 --> 09:39.640
attribute your success to? I think so, yeah. I 
couldn't disagree more than that.
