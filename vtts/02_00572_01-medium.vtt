00:01.263 --> 00:04.669
This is an interview with Mary Miller. The date is 
April 11th, 1985. What is your maiden name and your

00:09.497 --> 00:12.562
entire name, please?

00:16.089 --> 00:24.503
And

00:16.089 --> 00:24.503
how old were you during the years of 1940 to 1945?

00:31.351 --> 00:34.554
And where were you in those same years, 1940, 1945? 
I was in Marseille

00:34.574 --> 00:43.382
part of the time, and then we moved to Nice. How long 
after France fell to the Nazis in 1940 was it before

00:43.402 --> 00:49.407
you became involved with the resistance? Well,

00:50.688 --> 01:00.497
I wasn't really involved very much with the 
resistance, but you might say that around 1943 we

00:50.688 --> 01:00.497
had a closer encounter. And what was this? Well, my 
brother and myself were living in a hotel very

01:04.713 --> 01:18.127
close to the Germans where the Gestapo was

01:04.713 --> 01:18.127
located. And the resistance was all around us. We 
were very much aware of what was going on, but I

01:21.610 --> 01:31.440
didn't actually participate in it, but my brother 
did. Okay. Did any of the roles that you had during

01:33.046 --> 01:41.297
that time, 1940, 1945, change as you went along? 
You said you were very close to all of what was going

01:41.317 --> 01:47.545
on in the resistance in Nice. Did you know about 
heads of resistance, people that were in the

01:49.448 --> 01:54.154
resistance? Do you know any names of people in that 
area that were in the resistance?

02:03.269 --> 02:23.509
Jean Médecin were very much in charge of the 
resistance and there were a lot of professors

02:03.269 --> 02:23.509
throughout these days in town and we didn't have 
any particular names that we could mention but we

02:03.269 --> 02:23.509
knew that all these people were working for the 
resistance. Everybody who was interested in

02:23.529 --> 02:28.534
getting rid of the Germans was involved in the 
resistance

02:34.808 --> 02:43.466
while

02:34.808 --> 02:43.466
then occupying my mother's hotel at that time in 
1943. Did you ever talk with the rest of your family

02:43.486 --> 02:52.345
about what they did in the resistance, what close 
friends or other family members did in the

02:43.486 --> 02:52.345
resistance?

02:55.480 --> 03:18.298
uh in one way we were trying to resist which was more 
or less an intellectual approach to it some of my

02:55.480 --> 03:18.298
teachers were writing poetry and literature and 
this was distributed throughout the city it was

02:55.480 --> 03:18.298
most of the time poking fun at the germans and 
trying to bring hope to the to the people about

03:18.278 --> 03:21.843
better days. And it was sort of underground kind of 
literature, but it was very necessary for the

03:22.184 --> 03:33.261
morale of the people. So this was one way that we 
were showing that we still had a little bit of hope

03:33.281 --> 03:44.217
and pride, and we weren't really losing the war. We 
were just temporarily

03:49.295 --> 03:53.302
You said you used a lot of literature and stuff. Was 
that ever used as a mode for a code for delivering

03:53.903 --> 03:59.412
messages or anything that you know of?

04:10.872 --> 04:12.935
There were messages that were delivered every 
day, and you could hear them on the radio in the

04:10.872 --> 04:12.935
morning. Even though it was jammed by the Germans, 
you could hear the radio messages going out. You

04:15.215 --> 04:36.163
said your brother did some stuff. Did you do any 
particular things before you ended up going to the

04:36.203 --> 04:40.969
boarding school?

04:47.918 --> 05:01.833
But the one thing we did, my mother and myself and my 
brother, was to hide the Jewish people who were

04:47.918 --> 05:01.833
being persecuted by the Germans. So in that sense 
we were doing a little bit of work for the

05:01.853 --> 05:06.518
non-citizens. But it wasn't very much of a tragedy 
to have

05:13.383 --> 05:21.132
from one day to the next, they could disappear, and 
they put in the trucks that were taking off for

05:13.383 --> 05:21.132
Auschwitz. And so we brought food to them, we hid 
them in the cellars, and we brought food to them,

05:22.453 --> 05:35.188
and we could have been in trouble had we been found 
out by the Germans, because it was a very serious

05:22.453 --> 05:35.188
matter.

05:43.302 --> 05:49.468
Did you have special codes among each other when 
you hid these people, the Jews? Did you have

05:49.529 --> 05:55.715
special ways that you could know that somebody 
else was sensitive to that? So

05:55.775 --> 06:12.853
did you have a code name in particular?

06:15.770 --> 06:17.154
Did anyone in your family?

06:20.184 --> 06:20.445
No. Okay. Did you know that D-Day was coming at all?

06:29.270 --> 06:45.132
like Nice was so close to the Italian border and so 
much in the south of France that they were never

06:29.270 --> 06:45.132
going to arrive, although we could hear on the 
radio every day the progress that they were making

06:29.270 --> 06:45.132
in the north and the central part of France, how 
they were becoming liberated. But Nice always

06:45.152 --> 06:48.477
seemed to be so far away, and we kept waiting. And 
the underground had been advised by the Allies,

06:53.384 --> 06:57.490
not to do anything to liberate the city, to wait for 
the Americans. But they finally got grown, became

06:57.610 --> 07:05.141
very desperate, and they decided to take matters 
in their own hands. And the young people of the

07:05.161 --> 07:09.908
underground are the ones who actually liberated 
these. And when the Americans arrived, it had

07:09.928 --> 07:14.875
already been liberated. Did you participate in 
this?

07:19.422 --> 07:25.815
Did you know of any specific incidences that 
friends of yours maybe participated in? Well,

07:25.875 --> 07:34.153
no, I didn't. Not really. Okay. But they were 
really told not to do anything about liberating

07:35.572 --> 07:39.619
the town. Okay. Were you aware of all the jobs that 
the resistance was doing, the intelligence, the

07:42.385 --> 07:52.804
transportation, what you helped with, hiding the 
Jews and moving them? Were you aware of all that was

07:53.124 --> 07:55.048
going on?

07:58.927 --> 08:14.944
We had, very close to our hotel, there was a house 
where the Gestapo used and the Nazis used to gather

07:58.927 --> 08:14.944
the Jewish people before they were put in the 
trucks and sent out to the railroad stations. sent

08:15.160 --> 08:38.485
to Auschwitz and these poor people were gathered 
in this one place and it was awful because you could

08:15.160 --> 08:38.485
hear them singing to keep courage and you could 
sometimes hear children crying and it was just a

08:15.160 --> 08:38.485
tragedy and we were all aware of what was going on 
and it was difficult, you know.

08:42.363 --> 08:43.565
Yeah. Were you aware of the ongoing arrests and 
execution of resistance members? I know you said

08:49.393 --> 08:56.424
you didn't do a lot, but y'all did hide the Jews, and 
that was, as you've already hinted at, punishable

08:49.393 --> 08:56.424
by the Germans. Were you aware of all the arrests 
and executions that were going on? And if so, how

08:59.709 --> 09:03.915
did you handle your own danger or your family's 
danger?

09:07.793 --> 09:11.659
and we didn't worry about the tension. We did know 
that they were, we couldn't even speak very, you

09:11.939 --> 09:24.638
know, outside because there were Nazi Gestapos 
all around that were wearing civilian clothes,

09:11.939 --> 09:24.638
and we were extremely cautious. But they made 
certainly no bones about what they would do to

09:24.618 --> 09:33.189
anybody if they actually caught them doing 
something. As a matter of fact, the most awful

09:33.209 --> 09:51.090
experience that we had, my brother and I, was 
walking down the main street and watching those

09:33.209 --> 09:51.090
two young men being hung in the pillars of the main 
street because they had been discovered to do

09:33.209 --> 09:51.090
underground work. And it was a terrible tragedy to 
see I

09:53.997 --> 10:01.088
can imagine. Did you, any member of your families, 
or anyone that you know, have, oh, I guess you could

10:02.930 --> 10:18.013
call them psychiatric problems during or after 
World War II, such as nervous breakdowns or

10:02.930 --> 10:18.013
continuous nightmares?

10:25.840 --> 10:28.803
were involved with the Germans. Some of the 
prostitutes, say, and some of the people who

10:29.504 --> 10:43.900
collaborated with the Germans had been all 
observed by the people of Nice, and they were

10:29.504 --> 10:43.900
punished. What they did is they loaded them up and 
put them in a... Well, first of all, they grabbed

10:43.941 --> 10:51.689
them and shaved their heads completely. And women 
were completely bald. And then they marked them in

10:55.810 --> 11:03.927
some way, and they put them in those large trucks, 
and they paraded them all through the city of Nice.

11:03.947 --> 11:09.499
So you can imagine that must have made a terrible 
effect on these people, and they probably

11:12.955 --> 11:14.237
Yeah, I would imagine. You've already mentioned 
the house that was close to the hotel you were in

11:14.597 --> 11:24.128
that they put the Jews in before they went off to the 
concentration camps. Were there any specific

11:24.669 --> 11:32.038
raids where the Nazis actually gathered up the 
people that you knew? Well,

11:32.058 --> 11:40.708
yes. As a matter of fact, one day on my birthday, I 
went next door to borrow a record carrier I didn't

11:45.085 --> 11:49.070
even know that, you know, I didn't even think that 
it was Jewish. I was just going to go, a record

11:49.090 --> 11:51.552
player. And when I walked in there with my friend, I 
realized that the gate was open to the garden. So we

11:59.382 --> 12:05.509
walked through there, and then we went to the front 
door, and we rang the bell, thinking my friend was

11:59.382 --> 12:05.509
going to answer it. But the Gestapo answered the 
door. And we started moving away, but they

12:08.692 --> 12:12.797
insisted that we come in. So this friend and myself 
walked in there, a little bit shaky, not knowing

12:12.777 --> 12:19.768
what was going to happen to us. And then they put us 
in a room because they didn't speak any French. And

12:24.216 --> 12:31.928
then they said that we should sit still and wait for 
the officer who spoke French to come over and talk

12:24.216 --> 12:31.928
to us. And we sat there, my friend and I, a little bit 
scared. for about 15 minutes, and finally this

12:34.833 --> 12:45.063
officer came with a great stature and started 
asking us if we were Jewish. And we said no, we

12:45.083 --> 12:48.567
weren't Jewish. We were just friends and people. 
And so he took us over into the living room, and this

12:51.470 --> 13:02.241
German man started slapping the Jewish man who was 
sitting in an armchair. and he had already been

13:02.575 --> 13:22.187
abused and he was in terrible shape and this German 
officer pointed out to the Jewish bread and the

13:02.575 --> 13:22.187
Jewish wine and the Jewish business Jewish that 
telling us that everything in this house was

13:02.575 --> 13:22.187
Jewish and this one was Jewish and were we Jewish we 
kept saying no we weren't Jewish and they said,

13:23.332 --> 13:33.507
okay, they took my friend who was a male and they 
said, go and check him, take his clothes off and see

13:23.332 --> 13:33.507
whether he's been circumcised. Because I guess in 
those days, you know, it was proof that they needed

13:33.527 --> 13:40.577
to be circumcised. And so, after a while, they put 
us back into the room and we kept waiting to know

13:40.597 --> 13:50.131
what was going to happen to us. We said, can we 
please go back to my house and they said well we let

13:52.407 --> 14:15.394
you go back but under one condition and it is that 
you say nothing nothing to anybody that we're here

13:52.407 --> 14:15.394
so we were finally released and we went back to the 
hotel and that was the end of that we were very

13:52.407 --> 14:15.394
scared and everybody thought we had been on some 
jump somewhere but

14:28.975 --> 14:39.925
His son, who fortunately had gone to a football 
game, escaped because the neighbors, as soon as he

14:28.975 --> 14:39.925
came home, advised him that the Gestapo was in his 
home. And he was sheltered in the neighbor's home,

14:40.446 --> 14:45.911
another neighbor of mine. And he was given some 
clothes, and he was sent to another city, and he

14:45.931 --> 14:52.717
changed his name. But I think that a few months 
later, we didn't hear from him anymore. Did you

15:00.312 --> 15:02.396
ever find out what happened to your friend? No,

15:04.761 --> 15:15.925
we

15:04.761 --> 15:15.925
didn't because he had sent us a couple of letters 
when he first arrived to Lyon, the other city that

15:04.761 --> 15:15.925
he went to, and as I say, changed his name, and we 
received two letters.

15:24.123 --> 15:33.031
I read quite a bit about the French police 
sometimes even seem to be aiding the Nazis. Were

15:33.894 --> 15:37.204
you ever questioned or harassed by the French 
police? Did it ever seem to you that they were

15:39.040 --> 15:47.289
trying to help the Nazis, maybe not by choice, but 
out of situation, they had to comply with what the

15:39.040 --> 15:47.289
Nazis were telling them? Did anyone ever seem to go 
against that? Did they get upset with that? Oh,

15:49.091 --> 15:50.193
yes, of course they did. But, you know, you had to 
play your part, right? You had to walk the middle of

15:52.495 --> 15:54.117
the road. You had to be very

15:54.137 --> 16:03.968
careful.

16:11.407 --> 16:14.041
You've already said you were questioned. Were any 
other members of your family ever questioned,

16:14.081 --> 16:17.620
maybe your mother or your brother?

16:30.374 --> 16:46.138
and that we were collaborating and we were 
playing, you know, and they even threatened to

16:30.374 --> 16:46.138
confiscate the radio from us because it was 
against their courage to try and find out what was

16:30.374 --> 16:46.138
really happening. And we kept saying, oh, no, we 
don't listen to the BBC. But one day we got tired of

16:50.964 --> 16:52.647
that. We said, OK, we're listening to the BBC. And 
you may as well hear that the war is being lost by you

16:54.871 --> 17:02.103
and that the Americans are coming to liberate us. 
And they were very shocked by that. But from that

17:04.508 --> 17:07.553
day on, they kept asking us because they didn't

17:21.202 --> 17:39.080
You

17:21.202 --> 17:39.080
seem very much to live where a bunch of Germans 
were. All we think of when we think of the Nazis are

17:39.140 --> 17:46.087
more like the Gestapo type Nazi. Can you tell me a 
little bit about the German people that were there

17:46.828 --> 17:51.192
as German soldiers?

17:56.302 --> 18:00.770
like they felt sorry for my little brother, who was 
so small and skinny. And one of the fellows kept

18:00.790 --> 18:08.603
asking him to come up to his room, and he would share 
his own lashes with my brother. But then on the

18:08.623 --> 18:12.049
other hand, they were the other breed

18:15.370 --> 18:19.075
And they were very ugly. They wouldn't let us use 
our dining room. And the maid would come

18:21.198 --> 18:29.471
downstairs, my mother's maid, and say, well, the 
first group of Germans used to give us leftover

18:21.198 --> 18:29.471
soup. Do you have any leftover? Because we need it. 
Don't throw it away. And they would say, no, we

18:34.858 --> 18:36.461
don't have any. They would never give us any. And we 
would actually see them throw it away.

18:49.610 --> 19:16.360
About

18:49.610 --> 19:16.360
what percentage of the population in your area do 
you think were members of the resistance?

19:29.519 --> 19:34.784
You knew about it, but you didn't know 
individuals, or did you know the individuals?

19:47.157 --> 19:48.879
We knew them by, we could see them go back and forth, 
but we didn't know them by name. There was no such

19:48.899 --> 19:51.542
thing as knowing them by name, you know, because 
they were all, you know, people that we never knew

19:48.899 --> 19:51.542
before anyway. Where did they come from? They were 
refugees from the northern part, or...?

20:02.948 --> 20:14.980
the professors, they were lawyers,

20:02.948 --> 20:14.980
they

20:02.948 --> 20:14.980
were all kinds of people. And one of the, I think, 
most prominent is the one whose family has been

20:15.000 --> 20:18.088
defective

20:26.877 --> 20:35.207
And do you know any people that continued from the 
resistance and, like you said, are now continuing

20:26.877 --> 20:35.207
to be prominent?

20:44.058 --> 20:48.263
Well, I've asked some pretty specific questions. 
Are there any things that you have, in particular

20:48.303 --> 20:54.471
your feelings about, World War II in general, or 
the invasion of the Nazis, or the Jews, anything

20:54.772 --> 21:03.565
that the French did in the resistance. Are there 
specific things that you would like to mention?

21:08.612 --> 21:24.154
Well,

21:08.612 --> 21:24.154
it was a pretty grim time, and I was young, and it was 
pretty astounding that we had to, you know, it was

21:08.612 --> 21:24.154
wartime, and we knew that the Germans were bad 
people, and we We knew that it wouldn't last, but we

21:24.539 --> 21:29.764
had to abide by the curfew. We had to... It was grim 
to see that our young men were being taken and sent

21:31.726 --> 21:46.141
over to Germany to make arms, to make more arms, or 
that our Jewish people were being persecuted. And

21:46.842 --> 21:48.884
it was really sad times for us. And to see our cities 
you know, being invaded by those troops walking up

21:50.257 --> 21:56.719
and down, yelling their songs, military songs. It 
was really a chilling experience.

22:07.570 --> 22:24.626
atrocities

22:07.570 --> 22:24.626
they did when they would take a machine gun in some 
of the country roads and would see a bunch of little

22:07.570 --> 22:24.626
girls come out of their church in their First 
Communion outfits and they would machine gun all

22:07.570 --> 22:24.626
these little girls. Atrocities like this went on 
all over France and it was a very bad period. Well, I

22:29.611 --> 22:33.034
think that's about all the questions I have. 
Anything else that you'd like to add?

22:40.240 --> 22:47.390
and we had a good sense of humor which helped us, you 
know, weather this storm and we were very proud of

22:40.240 --> 22:47.390
our young people. I was very proud of my own brother 
because of what he did by concealing and stealing

22:47.410 --> 22:57.964
those weapons and passing them out to the 
underground. My mother and I and myself were

22:58.605 --> 23:01.168
extremely surprised after the armistice to be 
invited to a very formal ceremony and to see my

23:01.148 --> 23:12.826
little brother step forward and be given a 
marvelous shiny medal. We didn't know why the

23:13.327 --> 23:23.663
medal was given to him, simply because he had been 
smuggling arms to the underground all these

23:13.327 --> 23:23.663
months.

23:28.570 --> 23:49.600
So

23:28.570 --> 23:49.600
you didn't know at the time that he was doing that?

23:52.263 --> 24:09.158
Well,

23:52.263 --> 24:09.158
I certainly appreciate the interview, and thank 
you very much. Let me see. You say there's one more

24:12.121 --> 24:16.665
episode with you and your brother playing tricks 
on the Germans?

24:19.547 --> 24:20.228
Well, go ahead.

24:26.502 --> 24:35.413
military marches, troops, and they were 
reporting to some kind of a base of activity. And we

24:36.814 --> 24:38.897
could tell them to come regularly. And so we 
decided that we would say some tricks on them. And

24:42.201 --> 24:45.324
it was at nighttime, and we knew they were coming 
up. And we, my brother and I, went to a street corner

24:45.344 --> 24:50.911
where we knew they were always turning. And we 
changed the street sign.

25:04.859 --> 25:21.100
They were marching around and they stopped around 
and the officer would flash his flashlight on the

25:04.859 --> 25:21.100
street sign and then he would see, oh, we must go in 
that direction and they would all march off into

25:04.859 --> 25:21.100
the wrong direction. And my brother and I would 
just giggle and laugh. See, that was a great story.

25:28.923 --> 25:29.947
I would say so. Well,

25:29.967 --> 25:36.233
again, thank you very much for this interview.
