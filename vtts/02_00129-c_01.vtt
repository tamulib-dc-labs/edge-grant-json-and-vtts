WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:04.933
Practice bonfire.

00:05.594 --> 00:07.056
Oh yeah, bonfire.

00:07.737 --> 00:10.821
And not only muster on the campus, but muster all over the world.

00:10.841 --> 00:11.402
All over the world.

00:11.422 --> 00:15.948
That's a remarkable accomplishment, I think, is the fact that.

00:15.988 --> 00:30.067
And whether, regardless of what our experience was, like I didn't get to go to A&M, but I was here 21 years, now back too, that I feel a part of this because I've been to many of these.

00:30.127 --> 00:32.130
I've spoken at a number of them and so forth.

00:32.802 --> 00:44.256
And this year at the muster at Nashville, Tennessee, with the great news they had to pass on, you can now buy Shiner beer and Blue Bell ice cream in Nashville, Tennessee.

00:44.276 --> 00:45.157
Oh, my word.

00:45.177 --> 00:46.258
Great Scott.

00:46.278 --> 00:49.362
They felt they had really accomplished something.

00:49.382 --> 00:49.762
Oh, me.

00:49.862 --> 00:51.564
But are we leaving anything out?

00:53.186 --> 00:54.227
Events?

00:54.368 --> 00:57.491
Yeah, that tend to pull the whole crowd together.

00:58.152 --> 01:00.615
I don't have any more to suggest, but I was just...

01:01.270 --> 01:11.624
I think the sports events, but now that's ongoing.

01:15.849 --> 01:16.711
No, I don't.

01:20.195 --> 01:21.277
Goodness gracious.

01:23.440 --> 01:24.060
Right, to whom?

01:24.982 --> 01:26.944
You personally.

01:26.964 --> 01:29.067
Who, if you look back on your

01:29.435 --> 01:30.436
experience here.

01:30.816 --> 01:39.306
Who are the people to whom you feel most indebted to in terms of gratitude for what they meant to you?

01:42.669 --> 01:44.371
Well, certainly Wayne Stark.

01:45.052 --> 01:46.313
Bob Cherry has.

01:46.453 --> 01:51.699
Bob's always been just real personable, helpful to me.

01:51.739 --> 01:57.585
I mentioned

01:57.987 --> 02:26.442
you know, John Paul Abbott, people like Austin Curley, you know, we were involved in this new student parent orientation type thing, which Wayne began incidentally in the back of the coffee shop up there and get three or four people, parents back there while they didn't have anything else to do.

02:26.827 --> 02:55.804
try to tell them about A&M and that thing grew immediately that we'd have oh in the ballroom up there a room full of parents and we'd each take a turn speaking to them but now uh uh later on of course people like uh Diebel uh Ray Diebel Clark Clark Clark Diebel yeah uh

02:55.919 --> 03:05.311
And then, well, Tom Cherry, I always had sort of a... Do you see Bob now?

03:05.791 --> 03:06.032
Mm-hmm.

03:06.432 --> 03:07.434
I saw him a long ago.

03:07.914 --> 03:12.540
Tell him about our conversation and tell him, because I have not called him yet.

03:12.620 --> 03:13.902
I would like very much for him.

03:15.283 --> 03:17.286
Don't know how willing he might be to...

03:17.873 --> 03:20.417
I think he would be amenable to this.

03:21.078 --> 03:27.167
Because what I want to say to everybody is if you don't want it, if you want it kept confidential, just don't say it.

03:27.347 --> 03:29.069
That would be his reservation.

03:29.109 --> 03:29.831
That would be fine.

03:29.851 --> 03:35.479
He knows so much, you know, about, oh my gosh, how long did he deal with the board, you know.

03:35.499 --> 03:35.759
That's right.

03:36.020 --> 03:44.472
Obviously there's so much that he couldn't say that he might not want to be in a position to be confronted with it.

03:45.059 --> 03:52.087
Clyde Freeman, you know, I worked with Clyde Freeman for years.

03:52.667 --> 03:59.595
And let's see, trying to think of the ones that are there now.

04:00.756 --> 04:04.761
They're all gone that I had anything to do with.

04:05.422 --> 04:06.943
Okay, next time.

04:06.963 --> 04:14.712
If you could organize Texas A&M and the Texas A&M system, how would you organize it?

04:17.712 --> 04:25.322
Where would the stations and the services report?

04:25.623 --> 04:28.836
Well, I always think they ought to report to the chancellor or his

04:29.373 --> 04:32.297
underling there, of course, that's all mixed up.

04:32.377 --> 04:35.941
Now they go through the dean of agriculture, don't they, or something?

04:35.981 --> 04:37.443
Well, they report to both.

04:38.544 --> 04:39.746
Hyler is both.

04:39.806 --> 04:40.687
Yes, yes.

04:40.787 --> 04:41.829
He's all the dean.

04:42.049 --> 04:45.473
And Hyler reports to the president, and Hyler reports to the chancellor.

04:46.554 --> 04:50.640
That's something that's got to be difficult, but I don't know.

04:50.660 --> 04:57.388
Yeah, to me, the chancellor, if you're going to have a system, and I think you need one, certainly,

04:59.225 --> 05:09.199
You need to have these clear lines, I think, to him or his, you know, subordinate staff there, but not these crooked things.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.163
Of course, these change from year to year.

05:12.543 --> 05:15.187
You know, Earl was... He was both.

05:15.307 --> 05:16.088
He was both.

05:16.369 --> 05:17.310
And Williams was both.

05:17.630 --> 05:18.712
Was Williams both?

05:18.872 --> 05:21.996
Until 76, when he has the heart attack.

05:22.537 --> 05:24.600
Oh, he was separated again?

05:24.620 --> 05:24.760
Mm-hmm.

05:25.685 --> 05:29.400
Who was his chief A&M administrator?

05:29.882 --> 05:30.304
Jarvis.

05:31.388 --> 05:32.794
Jarvis wasn't president?

05:32.914 --> 05:36.589
Yes, Jarvis was and the relationship didn't work well.

05:38.138 --> 05:50.702
They picked Jarvis in 76 to be president, and Jarvis is president from 76 to 80, and Dr. Williams leaves about 78 to go to Houston.

05:52.826 --> 05:54.469
But they didn't work well.

05:55.310 --> 06:01.041
The relationship wasn't as smooth as it might have been, and one of the big arguments was,

06:01.021 --> 06:07.969
later, with Hubert and Miller, was where do the stations and the services report?

06:07.989 --> 06:09.210
Oh, man, alive.

06:10.672 --> 06:11.472
Well, there is.

06:11.492 --> 06:19.421
Of course, you've got research and teaching and all of those, and it's complicated.

06:19.441 --> 06:20.582
It's complicated.

06:22.404 --> 06:24.667
Let's see, two other things, and then let me let you go.

06:25.788 --> 06:27.450
If you have any

06:28.460 --> 06:38.840
personal papers, archival material that you ever want to dispose of, please consider putting it in the ANM archives in Cushing.

06:38.860 --> 06:39.661
Okay.

06:40.283 --> 06:42.587
They'll take better care of it than anybody else will.

06:43.057 --> 06:46.421
and we'll get it organized and make it available.

06:46.742 --> 06:54.492
I have a letter that my father wrote to Dr. Walton once that had to do with the draining of this lake down here, you know.

06:55.994 --> 07:05.086
And, you know, that's one thing that Mr. Gilchrist did, was to have all these bodies of water drained and mosquito controlled, and it was a filthy lake.

07:05.106 --> 07:07.309
I mean, you can't, but then again,

07:07.947 --> 07:10.831
It was just a weed infested place from then on.

07:11.451 --> 07:19.381
And this letter is asking help from the university about here we've got this blood weed growing thing down here.

07:20.422 --> 07:28.953
He went all several pages about how we as children played down there in the Tarzan and all this sort of thing.

07:28.973 --> 07:30.715
It's an interesting letter.

07:31.015 --> 07:38.475
But I wanted to send it to Steve Vici, you know, Parks and Recreation here.

07:38.675 --> 07:43.689
But, you know, a copy of it was with David Chapman up there, too.

07:43.829 --> 07:47.539
One of the people I offered this to was Mrs. Rudder.

07:47.519 --> 07:54.165
because Ann had cautioned me, typists leave this off when we're, when you're typing this version.

07:55.746 --> 07:59.790
Mrs. Rudder still has the vast majority of Mr. Rudder's papers.

08:00.290 --> 08:00.651
Really?

08:00.891 --> 08:07.076
Yeah, and occasionally, according to Ann, people will stop by and talk her out of some of them.

08:07.176 --> 08:10.859
She'll give him, she'll give this somebody a letter sign, Bail B.J.

08:10.879 --> 08:11.380
or something.

08:12.661 --> 08:15.544
How would she, how did she get them?

08:15.604 --> 08:17.205
Well, she still has all of his,

08:17.506 --> 08:19.168
all of his personal everything.

08:21.110 --> 08:21.911
I know, but why?

08:21.951 --> 08:24.735
They ought to be in the archives.

08:24.755 --> 08:25.636
Oh, yes.

08:25.796 --> 08:28.139
Because another thing, there might be a fire.

08:28.379 --> 08:28.780
Who knows?

08:29.501 --> 08:30.182
Oh, yeah.

08:30.642 --> 08:31.363
All right, last thing.

08:31.543 --> 08:31.924
Okay.

08:33.946 --> 08:38.772
Somebody gives you a million-dollar check, and there's only one condition.

08:39.123 --> 08:44.434
you must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you decide what it would be used for.

08:44.594 --> 08:45.877
Oh, heaven forbid.

08:45.977 --> 08:53.974
What would you, if you could make a big, big, big presentation, what would it go for?

08:53.994 --> 08:57.621
It wouldn't be in the sports arena.

09:01.432 --> 09:15.652
Oh, if it would be needed, supplementing any awards to teacher or service award type things, which I think means a lot.

09:15.692 --> 09:24.705
I mean, you know, that watch you're wearing, it means a lot to people like that and things of this nature.

09:25.782 --> 09:33.191
I mean, really, that's kind of a hard question to answer, but A&M already has millions that they don't know what to do with, I think, sometimes.

09:33.211 --> 09:37.697
But I think service recognition more than anything, if it would.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.241
Last, last, last.

09:41.261 --> 09:43.844
What has it meant to you?

09:43.864 --> 09:44.785
To be with A&M?

09:45.266 --> 09:46.187
My life.

09:46.522 --> 09:50.207
You know, my life from the very beginning to the very end.

09:51.148 --> 09:53.771
Granted, I'm quite confused now.

09:53.831 --> 10:00.479
I go up on campus and, you know, here are the ag buildings now, the history building and something else.

10:00.559 --> 10:11.753
And one of the things walking across the campus, the buildings that I am familiar with are dwarfed by, you know, this is startling.

10:11.952 --> 10:20.041
I didn't think that would be so noticeable, but they are simply dwarfed by the bigger buildings there.

10:20.221 --> 10:22.744
So I feel like now I don't belong.

10:22.784 --> 10:26.568
It's just a whole new world up there.

10:26.748 --> 10:35.057
But my life from the very beginning, which I'm very happy with and proud of,

10:35.611 --> 10:42.280
So to witness all this growth here through the years has just been phenomenal.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.807
It's been great.

10:44.068 --> 10:44.490
Thank you.
