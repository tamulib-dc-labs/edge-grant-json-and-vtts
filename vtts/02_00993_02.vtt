WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:04.041
I basically did not trust them. I mean, I was really 
early on was convinced we were in a guerrilla

00:04.902 --> 00:09.849
conflict. From January to, I want to say, April, I 
was breaking in at the Third Surge in Bien Hoa. And

00:19.102 --> 00:21.946
then they decided that they would really make it 
mobile. And there was going to be a big operation in

00:22.206 --> 00:25.431
the highlands up near Pleiku. And they were going 
to take the hospital on the road. And some

00:29.615 --> 00:34.082
brilliant person decided that they could not take 
the fragile women along. So they played fruit

00:34.743 --> 00:40.932
basket turnover with every nurse corps officer in 
the entire command in MACV. And they brought all

00:41.413 --> 00:48.463
the men nurses in to the third search, and they 
shipped all of us women out to replace them. And I

00:48.904 --> 00:53.370
got sent down to the third field in Saigon, which 
might have well have been Walter Reed. It was the

00:53.390 --> 00:54.692
same problem again. And when I reported in, in my 
fatigues, who was the brand new chief nurse

00:55.583 --> 01:04.739
sitting at the desk but brand new Lieutenant 
Colonel Kitty Betts. And her first words to me

01:04.760 --> 01:10.069
were, well, Lieutenant Hart, you didn't last out 
in the field very long, did you? And I said, no,

01:10.931 --> 01:12.053
ma'am. But I won't be here long either, ma'am. And 
she said, you know, you can't wear that outfit

01:17.403 --> 01:20.748
here. This is a station hospital. You've got to 
have duty whites. I said, man, my orders do not

01:23.792 --> 01:28.239
stipulate duty whites, and I don't have them with 
me. I'll have to wear my fatigues. She said, no, you

01:30.903 --> 01:32.044
won't. You can wear your class B greens. So you know 
that little whack outfit, that little green and

01:34.448 --> 01:41.919
white polyester thing with the short sleeves and 
the black shoes? That's what I wore in Saigon on the

01:42.479 --> 01:45.604
wards on duty. and I arrived my first that night for 
night shift I mean so much for orientation now they

01:47.255 --> 02:07.980
yak on and on about how we have to take these little 
children under our wings and teach them

01:47.255 --> 02:07.980
everything we know about our environment for six 
weeks before we make them responsible for

01:47.255 --> 02:07.980
anything and those days we just walked in and said 
hi I'm the new nurse where's the where do you keep

01:47.255 --> 02:07.980
the you know And I arrived, and there were two 
medics there, kind of wondering if a nurse was

02:08.618 --> 02:16.827
going to show up. What it was is the third field had 
been the American school in Saigon before the

02:17.108 --> 02:26.739
balloon went up and the war got big, and they moved 
all the embassy dependents out. And it was built

02:27.479 --> 02:36.870
like a school, and this was a four-classroom, 
single-story wing, a little lanai sort of affair,

02:27.479 --> 02:36.870
with a covered porch out in front of it. And those 
four classrooms were my four wards, and they each

02:37.441 --> 02:43.328
had about ten beds in them. Again, three of them 
were surgical wards, and the fourth one in the back

02:43.348 --> 02:47.713
was the clap ward. And all the guys with 
epididymitis and swollen scrotums and stuff like

02:48.394 --> 02:56.963
that would go in and lob the ice bags under the 
sheet. Chunk, you know, chunk. You don't look. You

02:59.086 --> 02:59.707
just throw. You can arrange it yourself. but give 
out lots and lots of penicillin, streptomycin,

03:01.758 --> 03:06.524
chloramycin. Antibiotic rounds were a biggie. I 
was just counting my blessings I didn't get sent

03:08.967 --> 03:14.634
over to the gymnasium where they had the malaria 
patients in triple bunks. There were like 80, 120

03:16.757 --> 03:20.582
of them at a time in the gymnasium in these bunks. My 
roommate was a medical nurse and worked in the

03:20.662 --> 03:23.946
gymnasium. Ugh, bad. And I wasn't in the neuro 
floor either, where all the guys with the gunshot

03:27.695 --> 03:32.981
wounds to the head were busy expiring. I was no fun. 
Interestingly enough, I met a nurse there who was a

03:34.843 --> 03:38.286
full-blooded Navajo Indian. Now, A, you don't see 
very many women Navajos off the reservation in the

03:39.047 --> 03:43.752
first place. B, very doggone few of them end up as 
college graduates with a profession. And C, they

03:48.337 --> 03:52.121
don't leave New Mexico and Arizona, even when they 
have. And Annie Yazzie, for some reason, ended up

03:52.622 --> 03:56.867
in the Army Nurse Corps and assigned to Vietnam. 
She had a All her black hair pulled into a single

03:57.817 --> 04:05.264
braid that she could sit on, and she coiled it up, 
smacked her nurse corps hat on. You want to talk

04:05.704 --> 04:10.849
about somebody who had culture shock with that, 
she would be worth a book all by herself. Real

04:11.350 --> 04:13.352
quiet, and nobody got to know her very well. I don't 
think I ever saw her smile. But from what I know

04:16.415 --> 04:22.260
about Navajos, that may not have meant what it 
would have meant for me. She worked on the neural

04:23.501 --> 04:24.642
floor. Anyway, so. About two months later, after 
they had had to court-martial two of the male

04:28.411 --> 04:41.947
nurses, and they had had terrible disciplinary 
problems with the drinking and the gambling and

04:28.411 --> 04:41.947
the carousing that was going on, the third search 
just went to sea, bad, with no civilizing

04:28.411 --> 04:41.947
influence. The CO put his foot down and said, I want 
my troops back. And they hauled us all back in,

04:48.115 --> 04:51.599
except a couple of gals refused to come back. They 
were mad, and they were not submitting to it if they

04:51.619 --> 04:57.186
weren't directly ordered. But most of us went 
back, and all those other guys get sent, who we

04:57.571 --> 05:07.546
never saw, so they were just, you know, Figman's 
ideas, went back to where they were supposed to be.

05:08.227 --> 05:15.597
And in that two months in Saigon, it was brought 
home to me real fast that this was a guerrilla

05:08.227 --> 05:15.597
operation and you couldn't trust anybody. I mean, 
it was daily stories of, you know, my own medics on

05:15.617 --> 05:26.413
night shift were out shopping one morning when 
they got off duty and somebody threw a grenade in

05:15.617 --> 05:26.413
their little pedicab, and One of them picked it up 
and threw it back out, and there were about 15

05:26.765 --> 05:33.215
people killed and hurt just on the street. And he 
was doing split-second thinking. He didn't think

05:35.659 --> 05:37.281
about where he threw it. He just thought about 
getting it out from under his own feet. And he was

05:40.686 --> 05:43.130
weird for a week after that.

05:46.055 --> 05:50.361
So I never wanted to win the hearts and minds of 
people. I didn't really want to get to know them

05:50.441 --> 05:54.207
because I didn't trust them, just from ground 
zero. Not that I blamed them for it. I just accepted

05:56.722 --> 06:02.231
it as a fact of life, like a snake handler who 
respects their abilities. Or a tiger tamer, you

06:03.313 --> 06:07.219
know. When it came time for you to leave, how did you 
feel about it? How did you cope with your feelings?

06:14.131 --> 06:14.952
I was glad to leave. It was a 12-month tour, and I 
came in as a replacement mid-tour. One of the gals

06:21.963 --> 06:31.497
who went over with the original batch with the 
third search was just diagnosed as being pregnant

06:21.963 --> 06:31.497
and was sent back six months into the tour, and I was 
sent to replace her. So I went through three crews

06:32.178 --> 06:35.563
in my 18 months. The people who were there for six 
months after I got there then left, and the new crew

06:36.424 --> 06:41.551
came in. I spent most of the year with them, and then 
because of the extension, I was working with

06:50.296 --> 06:54.580
virtually strangers when I got ready to leave. So I 
didn't have any ties to break with my coworkers

06:54.660 --> 06:58.824
because they had left me. This picture shows it 
pretty well because this was when we set up in Dong

07:01.466 --> 07:05.990
Tam. And those of us who had been with the unit in 
Bien Hoa were all wearing Third Surge patches. And

07:14.198 --> 07:17.701
when we set up in Dong Tam, there's only two of us 
left with that patch on. What happened to the

07:17.922 --> 07:19.543
picture? No, mislighted. Well, anyway, these 
were our third surge patches.

07:29.628 --> 07:30.349
Oh, here we go. You see? There's only two of us left 
with that patch on. The others, these kids, I don't

07:33.692 --> 07:35.873
even remember their names. I served with them for 
about two months. And during that two months, we

07:38.636 --> 07:46.503
packed up and we moved, what, 150 kilometers south 
and reset up, and we set up an inflatable hospital.

07:46.523 --> 07:49.345
That's the only picture I've got that shows the 
inflatable units. Most of the time, we were in what

07:50.742 --> 07:58.048
were called Southeast Asia Hooches, which were 
basically looked like this. At some point in time,

07:59.049 --> 08:06.015
we plasticed over the windows and put in 
single-unit

07:59.049 --> 08:06.015
window air conditioners. These were the litter 
racks in pre-op. This is when they carried the

08:08.077 --> 08:12.601
litters in off the helicopter, just plopped them 
right on that. The metal litter racks just were not

08:13.082 --> 08:16.805
cool, so the sergeants built those. They were 
sturdier and stayed put when you were doing things

08:17.385 --> 08:20.428
like CPR. But, I don't know, it had been 18 months. I 
was six months a bride and had never really lived

08:27.193 --> 08:30.757
with my husband. He'd been wounded twice. I was 
really kind of interested in getting him out of

08:32.459 --> 08:34.582
there, too. My dad had gone on home, and I was ready 
to go back and start on the next part of my life. I was

08:41.569 --> 08:42.691
getting out of the Army. In those days, you did. You 
know, I was a wife. I was going to have children. I

08:47.515 --> 08:53.706
was going to wear white clothes and go to lunches 
and coffees and, you know, do all that good stuff

08:47.515 --> 08:53.706
like my mother had done before me. Little did I know 
that social change was swirling around me as I even

08:54.547 --> 08:58.675
spoke. I wasn't even planning to work.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.328
What did you feel like when you returned? I'd never 
seen so many things to buy and eat and you know you

09:08.502 --> 09:34.847
didn't have to to worry about you didn't have to 
look twice at the cab driver you know that kind of

09:08.502 --> 09:34.847
thing I just remember just being delighted tired 
jet lag kind of you came back on a 26-hour flight and

09:08.502 --> 09:34.847
then you changed air airports you know you had to 
take the shuttle bus down from Travis to the San

09:35.131 --> 09:37.494
Francisco, whatever that airport is called. And 
then we flew to Denver. We got into Denver about 1 in

09:39.616 --> 09:41.779
the morning. His folks were there to pick us up. We 
got in the station wagon in the middle of the night

09:44.583 --> 09:53.413
and drove three hours south to his home in Lamar, 
Colorado. And about, you know, 4 in the morning, I

09:53.994 --> 09:56.818
climbed into bed. I mean, you don't have a lot of, 
let's examine our reactions. You know, you get

10:02.204 --> 10:04.547
real, real... I woke up about noon because I was 
convinced that I was being bombed. And I scrambled

10:09.554 --> 10:12.397
up in this strange bedroom, in this strange bed. I 
scrambled the headboard of the bed, and there's a

10:12.437 --> 10:18.223
window right over it, and there's this airplane 
coming right for me. And I screamed. And it just, I

10:21.245 --> 10:24.028
went, whoo, it was a crop duster. And, of course, 
Lee had grown up with that stuff all his life, but

10:25.349 --> 10:32.256
I'd grown up on air bases, and when a plane was 
coming right for you, this was problems. I wasn't

10:33.316 --> 10:36.881
used to people flying 20 feet off the deck for no 
good reason. But then it was a matter of, I had no

10:38.684 --> 10:41.728
clothes. What I had, I had left with my folks a year 
and a half before. And it was half the country away.

10:49.319 --> 10:50.360
I had to go shopping. I had to get a few things. I 
didn't really have any big reaction. We left there

10:55.988 --> 11:00.996
and went and visited my folks briefly in 
Washington. Then we drove down to Fort Benning and

11:02.864 --> 11:31.082
got our quarters and then we left there and went up 
to Jody and Bob's wedding and then we went back to

11:02.864 --> 11:31.082
Fort Benning and of course we were living with 
people who had all just well at least the guys had

11:02.864 --> 11:31.082
just all come through the same thing and a lot of 
them were people we knew it was Benning was a big

11:02.864 --> 11:31.082
post everybody was there for the advanced course 
and most of them were first lieutenants moving

11:02.864 --> 11:31.082
into promotable for captain and so a lot of our same 
buddy group was there either at the same time or

11:32.058 --> 11:36.825
came before we left. Did you talk about Vietnam at 
all with these people? With them, yes. Do you think

11:44.456 --> 11:49.403
that helped you return the vice those who just got 
out and returned back to the Seminole?

11:53.189 --> 11:54.451
It wasn't ever that hard on me. I mean, bad things 
happen to people who are in hospitals. That's

12:01.302 --> 12:02.383
never changed. It was true when I was a student 
nurse at Maryview. People had cancer. People got

12:06.227 --> 12:07.308
hit by trucks. You know, things happen. We handle 
gunshot wounds every day at Scott and White. Well,

12:12.273 --> 12:14.756
not every day, but it's not infrequent. And so the 
how they got that way wasn't a big issue. Now, for

12:19.741 --> 12:22.985
the guys who were cannon fodder, I guess it was a big 
issue. Why did I get sent out there to get shot at?

12:25.767 --> 12:26.348
But, uh... The thing I absorbed from them over the 
next year was a terrible and bitter sense of having

12:28.758 --> 12:37.769
been sent off to do something and then sent back to 
be spit at. That brings us to how do you feel about

12:39.732 --> 12:41.654
the protesters? Vicious. I have absolutely no use 
for them. As an employer, I will not hire one if I

12:47.161 --> 12:55.491
know that's in their background, and I will find 
some other way to justify it, since I know I have an

12:47.161 --> 12:55.491
illegal leg to stand on.

13:00.145 --> 13:05.191
Do you have any other thing you want to add or feel 
would be pertinent?

13:07.073 --> 13:09.516
It hasn't ever been the same for me as it has for him. 
When we were in Colorado and he was on degree

13:10.257 --> 13:16.384
completion, I was getting a degree too with my GI 
Bill. I'm one of the few women veterans you'll ever

13:16.444 --> 13:20.208
meet who used the whole sucker up. I got a 
bachelor's and all but one semester of a master's

13:21.009 --> 13:24.013
out of it. I just considered it was something they 
owed me. You know, I don't know if I'd have felt that

13:26.856 --> 13:28.498
way if it hadn't been for the fact that it was not a 
patriotic, publicly supported war. But I really

13:35.583 --> 13:39.268
felt like then it held me. Not because I felt like 
I'd been under great hardships or, you know,

13:39.288 --> 13:43.895
because it hadn't been. I lived good. I ate 
A-rations, fresh lettuce, ice cream. I mean, I was

13:49.724 --> 13:51.486
in a hospital for Pete's sake. Now, granted, the 
outfits we wore left something to be desired in

13:52.388 --> 13:58.637
terms of fashion, but hey, they were comfy. I had a 
Sears and Roebuck charge card and a catalog I was

13:59.258 --> 14:27.257
the shopping center of the entire Third Surge 
always had orders coming back and forth the APO

13:59.258 --> 14:27.257
96227 that Sears and Roebuck knew that well we all 
dressed out of Sears and it was all on my charge card

13:59.258 --> 14:27.257
but

13:59.258 --> 14:27.257
the few of them that I have met since And the most 
recent one is Karen Mundell. This lady now has a

14:32.344 --> 14:33.906
PhD. She also used up all her GI Bill. And she's the 
director of the Women's Center at St. Luke's AMI in

14:36.129 --> 14:41.255
Denver, Colorado. And she's a nationally known 
speaker at healthcare conferences. And, you

14:47.582 --> 14:55.371
know, we became competent under those 
circumstances. We were cut away from absolutely

14:56.836 --> 15:16.453
everything else that we had depended on in the 
past, and we did what we did, and we did it well, and

14:56.836 --> 15:16.453
we survived, and we became very cut and dry about 
how things are attacked, how things are

14:56.836 --> 15:16.453
approached, how problems are, the 
problem-solving process. And I think that's the

15:17.474 --> 15:25.881
invisible link when we recognize each other 
because we have this very brusque, attitude that

15:26.266 --> 15:54.805
you don't get in a real structured hospital 
environment where there's always bosses bosses

15:26.266 --> 15:54.805
bosses kind of thing we didn't have that you were 
the pre-op nurse in the middle of the night you were

15:26.266 --> 15:54.805
it until the others got themselves shagged out of 
their bags and you know brushed their teeth and got

15:26.266 --> 15:54.805
there to help you and decisions you made in that 10 
minutes were critical

15:26.266 --> 15:54.805
it was it was a real interesting way to spend a 
couple years of your youth very few of them stayed

15:56.641 --> 16:24.268
in the MERS corps a number of them rejoined I ran 
into a number of them eight years later when I

15:56.641 --> 16:24.268
rejoined and they'd all had breaks in service and 
had gone out and found that indeed the civilian

15:56.641 --> 16:24.268
world did have a tendency to be slow and corporate 
and all that kind of thing and then we joined the

15:56.641 --> 16:24.268
army and found out that in peacetime it did too We 
were used to combat pace of this and these fixed.

16:27.974 --> 16:28.414
Fix it. And, you know, filling out three years in 
advance capital budget schedules and that kind of

16:29.075 --> 16:35.403
thing just wasn't our idea of how things were done.

16:39.908 --> 16:43.693
But like I said before, the names change and you 
can't keep track of these people. And so, you know,

16:45.675 --> 16:49.660
other than having, I ran into Karen at a conference 
just last year. I don't know where any of these

16:50.020 --> 16:52.483
people are.

16:56.007 --> 16:57.088
Thanks for your time. Thanks for that interview.

17:02.195 --> 17:02.496
You're welcome. This has been an interview with 
Geraldine Ann Johnson, maiden name Hart. She

17:06.801 --> 17:12.649
served in the Army Nurse Corps and was stationed at 
Vietnam from January 1966 to June 1967. She is

17:12.709 --> 17:19.218
married to a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Lee 
Leonard C. Johnson with two children. She is

17:19.758 --> 17:24.765
presently the head nurse at Pediatrics located at 
Scott and White, Temple, Texas.
