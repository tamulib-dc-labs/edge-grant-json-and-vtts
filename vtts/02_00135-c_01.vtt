WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:09.395
and muster and silver taps and things like that.

00:13.061 --> 00:23.979
When you came back, everybody was determined, as 
you are getting ready to graduate, tell me about

00:13.061 --> 00:23.979
getting a job and things like that. What was the job 
market? The job market was a big... I guess if I had

00:31.756 --> 00:35.741
to overall look, I could say it was a circus. 
Wendell Horsley had fine-tuned the job

00:37.143 --> 00:50.021
application process, and he provided us. I have a 
little portrait, a print cut, a printed resume, In

01:01.085 --> 01:13.841
my case, I was a distinguished student in a degree 
in mechanical

01:01.085 --> 01:13.841
engineering.

01:14.001 --> 01:25.355
Dr. Gilchrist had arranged for me to get a 
fellowship to go to Purdue. And I felt like that

01:25.375 --> 01:30.822
would be a tough road to hold. year-and-a-half 
old, almost two-year-old son, and no

01:31.831 --> 01:43.648
money. So I thanked him profusely and went ahead to 
my applications, and I interviewed, I had ten job

01:43.668 --> 01:57.147
offers to have more. I took the job offered by 
Humboldt and a planning company, Exxon, because

01:57.717 --> 02:22.334
it was slightly more money, but at the time it was a 
company that I had most confidence in would still

01:57.717 --> 02:22.334
be there as long as I wanted to be there. Do you 
remember what that starting salary was? Yeah, it

02:24.903 --> 02:28.667
was $2.37 an hour on a drilling drill. Cool. And you 
graduated? This was January of 1947. Tell me about

02:35.433 --> 02:39.197
the commencement ceremony. I don't think there 
was one. I wasn't there. I'd gone to get my job lined

02:43.001 --> 02:48.326
up. I went down to Houston and they told me to come 
back in several days and I went back and Got things

02:55.008 --> 03:03.498
set with Virginia and Little Rock and then I went 
back and they told me to go over to Beaumont. Did you

03:04.018 --> 03:08.323
get, where, how did you obtain your diploma? Was it 
mailed to you or do you remember? Yeah, as I recall

03:11.567 --> 03:14.730
it was mailed to me. Let's see, one of that I 
remember, see that I missed was Bonfire. Was there

03:19.235 --> 03:21.157
a Bonfire held in those days? Oh yeah. Where was it? 
It was in the middle of the drill field. Okay. For

03:29.232 --> 03:47.750
example, when I was a freshman, it was mandatory on 
the freshman to scout the wood for the bonfire

03:29.232 --> 03:47.750
in the months of October and early November. And 
the guys in my outfit, we discovered a a lonesome

03:53.345 --> 03:59.091
telephone pole down there north of Northgate. It 
was out in the vacant lot. It looked kind of malty.

04:04.095 --> 04:10.622
So we

04:04.095 --> 04:10.622
undertook to appropriate that pole. Some folks 
put a lot of concrete around the bottom of it. So it

04:16.507 --> 04:22.373
took us, I guess, about two weeks of rocking that 
thing back and forth to

04:26.065 --> 04:31.390
It took two weeks of rocking that thing back and 
forth before we could finally pull it out of the

04:26.065 --> 04:31.390
ground. And then we hauled it up there and laid our 
stack on the pile. So it was a pile then of... No more

04:38.237 --> 04:43.583
than one telephone pole high. Okay. A telephone 
pole not as tall as a black pole. All right. And

04:48.107 --> 04:49.849
there was not paper. Somehow they always found a 
chick sail to go on top. That's what I've heard.

04:54.513 --> 04:56.055
Now, there was no... No trash paper or cardboard? 
No.

05:02.340 --> 05:06.506
It was all wood, but it was not stacked up, 
organized like it is now? Oh, no. Nobody was in

05:09.711 --> 05:11.994
charge. Everybody made their contribution as 
they saw fit. Did the whole student body turn out

05:17.281 --> 05:19.084
for it? Oh, yeah.

05:23.169 --> 05:25.232
I guess it was after I came back from it. Texas Corps 
tried to firebomb

05:26.056 --> 05:33.187
it from an airplane, but that didn't happen. They 
always had the chick saying, and it wasn't a big

05:33.207 --> 05:37.914
deal. Where did that, where did those words come 
from? The chick saying? Oh, that's a long,

05:43.363 --> 05:51.495
long thing to say. It sure didn't have anything to 
do with anything. Okay. The most important

05:55.334 --> 05:58.899
question of all. Now as you look back, what did it 
mean to you and your life that you went to A&M? What

06:06.511 --> 06:07.532
effect did it have?

06:10.677 --> 06:18.869
Well, the greatest thing that could happen to me, 
I'll forever be grateful for the opportunity.

06:22.054 --> 06:24.598
I went to A&M, I had the opportunity to who

06:25.608 --> 06:54.568
get an education, literally thousands of 
friends, and have had the opportunity

06:25.608 --> 06:54.568
to lead several causes that have, I think, 
bolstered respect

06:25.608 --> 06:54.568
for me, and just to serve all that come their way. I 
could have gone, I had applications to MIT,

06:55.105 --> 07:21.675
Caltech,

06:55.105 --> 07:21.675
Stanford, but I collected for reasons of either 
housing or otherwise, or not to try, but I had a good

06:55.105 --> 07:21.675
start. I was really humble. Thank

07:24.535 --> 07:36.579
you, thank you.

07:42.491 --> 07:43.894
Let's quit there.
