00:01.381 --> 00:06.467
interviewing Dr. Glenn Johnson in the Center for 
Teaching Excellence. Dr. Johnson has been at

00:06.888 --> 00:18.001
Texas A&M since 1967, which is a couple of years 
before the College of Education actually became a

00:06.888 --> 00:18.001
college. And Dr. Johnson, I would like for you if 
you would just kind of think back to the time that

00:18.441 --> 00:30.055
you arrived and the things that have happened and 
the changes that have taken place within the

00:18.441 --> 00:30.055
College of Education your arrival, just some of 
the highlights. Obviously, that's a big order,

00:32.270 --> 00:34.414
very open-ended. Well, let's see. I came a little 
early. They had some funds to bring me in in

00:37.478 --> 00:45.811
mid-August, so I was actually on the job a few 
months before the beginning of the year. You came

00:46.051 --> 00:47.153
in in what capacity? Funds for what? Travel, 
consulting, and so forth. It was the way in those

00:51.980 --> 00:57.628
days to get new faculty, move, and on the job before 
they actually had courses to teach, et cetera. So

01:03.564 --> 01:05.526
you did not have a course at the time? No. What 
department were you with originally? At that

01:08.771 --> 01:14.379
time, in August, it was called the Department of 
Education and Psychology. And at the end of that

01:14.960 --> 01:19.206
month, that no longer existed. It became the 
Department of Education. And the Department of

01:21.769 --> 01:27.818
Psychology opened its doors September 1 of 67. So 
during that first year, I was

01:29.047 --> 01:52.845
under the impression that there was going to be 
some great growth take place at Texas A&M

01:29.047 --> 01:52.845
University, and particularly in education, 
because they had only recently begun to advertise

01:29.047 --> 01:52.845
that it was coeducational. Was that in 68 or 67? 67. 
OK. So when we met with our students for the first

01:57.413 --> 02:12.509
time the first week of September, we found out that 
at Texas A&M University, there were

01:57.413 --> 02:12.509
approximately 600 girls enrolled. And a large 
proportion of them were in the Department of

02:12.529 --> 02:18.415
Education.

02:20.398 --> 02:25.463
Our projections then were that this was probably 
going to double annually. because of the

02:26.320 --> 02:30.727
now-released publicity on it. There had been a 
tendency not to really banter this. That there

02:34.834 --> 02:35.876
were girls here? Yeah, that there were girls here. 
So the word had gotten out in the informal

02:38.841 --> 02:44.550
communication net, and that's why we had 600. But 
now they were starting to publicize it with flyers

02:44.690 --> 02:52.463
and bulletins and news releases, etc., And in 
retrospect, that held true for several years. It

02:56.185 --> 02:59.769
just seemed like we were doubling our enrollment 
every year. So 600 girls, 1,200 girls, 2,400. How

03:03.273 --> 03:06.676
long did that keep up? For years, because I think it 
must have been around, you could check someone in

03:07.197 --> 03:16.847
the university, I'll bet around 70, 778, we were 
probably at 10,000 girls. That's a guess.

03:29.236 --> 03:29.537
I'll take that. Interesting. Yeah, I think even 
that first year I was there in 1967, 68, the

03:30.137 --> 03:46.277
informal communication that was saying that we 
were going to become a college of education, that

03:30.137 --> 03:46.277
the growth was so rampant in the demand, so great, 
that this would take place. And of course, later we

03:54.556 --> 04:11.433
would find out that President Rutter, who had 
hired Frank Hubert to be the dean of the College of

03:54.556 --> 04:11.433
Arts and Sciences,

03:54.556 --> 04:11.433
gave Dean Hubert a choice. Basically said, Frank, 
would you like to be Dean of Arts and Sciences as you

04:16.143 --> 04:23.172
are now, or would you like to be the Dean of the new 
College of Education when it opens? Did that

04:23.652 --> 04:28.418
comment surprise anybody, that he chose to go to 
the Dean of the College of Education? It didn't

04:28.438 --> 04:32.423
surprise me, because I'd heard him talk about 
this. He just felt like with all of his experience

04:33.644 --> 04:44.918
in the public schools and being in charge of 
certification for the state of Texas at one time

04:33.644 --> 04:44.918
with the Texas Education Agency, that his next 
thrust, his next contribution to Texas A&M

04:45.623 --> 04:54.678
University would be in the new College of 
Education. And he had a dream that it would always

04:54.698 --> 05:01.148
be called the new College of Education. I can 
recall him addressing the new department heads

05:01.168 --> 05:10.804
when they formed the new departments and saying 
that he hoped that always would be the new college

05:11.172 --> 05:13.477
of education. We didn't want things to become 
entrenched where people started building their

05:13.497 --> 05:25.705
empires and would have nothing to do with the other 
departments. Were there any specific political

05:25.921 --> 05:33.912
or sociological things that might have impacted 
the tremendous growth other than, of course, the

05:25.921 --> 05:33.912
admittance of girls? And that was definitely one 
of the largest. That was the biggest, I think. I

05:37.036 --> 05:45.768
think as soon as they opened it up to the girls, it 
just brought a totally different cultural look,

05:37.036 --> 05:45.768
atmosphere. Everything was very, very positive.

05:51.115 --> 05:55.000
Because it grew so fast, as a professor, Did you 
feel that this had a definite change on the way you

05:55.705 --> 06:04.057
were able to interact with students or work with 
students? I didn't feel that way because they'd

06:04.878 --> 06:16.534
always taken such great pride in being able to 
interact with the students and holding the

06:04.878 --> 06:16.534
student as an extremely important part of the 
university. At least in our department and in the

06:16.554 --> 06:24.025
college in general, I felt like they tried to 
maintain that, but they would go the extra mile to

06:24.764 --> 06:30.491
maintain that atmosphere. The mission of a land 
grant institution is the triad of teaching,

06:31.452 --> 06:37.720
research, and service. In your opinion, from your 
point of view, perspective, has that changed in

06:38.441 --> 06:48.854
the two eras with emphasis on one more so than 
another? Only slightly. For example, in 1967, Dr.

06:55.375 --> 07:05.247
Jerry Salek, who was also a graduate of Columbia 
University, although I didn't know him at all

06:55.375 --> 07:05.247
until we both arrived in August. Dr. Salek and I, 
along with some personnel who were already here,

07:05.267 --> 07:24.690
Lorene Robey, Dr. Lane Murray, Dr. Bill Graves, 
and Dr. Roger Harrell, under leadership of Dr.

07:05.267 --> 07:24.690
Paul Hensley, opened The education program in 
1967 was a totally different way of looking at

07:25.902 --> 07:34.594
teacher preparation. We implemented what was 
called a block program. We had the students all

07:37.918 --> 07:42.925
day, every day, five days a week for the first six 
weeks. And we had all our methods, courses, and

07:43.986 --> 07:54.340
educational psychology all being team or 
cooperatively team taught. first six weeks, and

07:54.657 --> 08:01.404
then the students went out and student taught all 
day, every day, five days a week for the rest of the

07:54.657 --> 08:01.404
semester. During that same semester, Jerry and I 
brought in interaction analysis training and

08:02.365 --> 08:11.775
micro-teaching training, which was very, very 
new. In fact, no one, to our knowledge, was doing

08:11.875 --> 08:16.860
any of that in the entire state of Texas. All they 
were doing was talking about it. Stanford had a

08:20.020 --> 08:21.743
program. The Far West Lab had done something. So it 
was pretty innovative at that time. It's not now.

08:30.136 --> 08:30.958
It's old hat. But in 1967, it was very innovative to 
bring all of that together. Interaction

08:36.887 --> 08:41.355
analysis, micro teaching, block program. And I 
think that started to build a reputation across

08:41.375 --> 08:45.842
the state. I heard Dean Hubert for probably the 
next three years say over and over, when I go

08:46.683 --> 09:03.402
traveling throughout the state, people keep 
referencing the work that we're doing in the block

08:46.683 --> 09:03.402
program interaction analysis and 
micro-teachings. The word was spreading. Also, I

09:05.544 --> 09:15.255
think another thing that had an impact was the 
region service centers had been established.

09:16.197 --> 09:17.439
When were those established? Do you know? I want to 
say 66, 67.

09:22.747 --> 09:40.213
But the key point there was that the Region Service 
Center in Houston invited Texas A&M to take

09:22.747 --> 09:40.213
$100,000 and develop the first training model 
for... early childhood education preparation.

09:44.135 --> 09:44.756
So we did. We spent that year developing a model and 
field testing it. In the summer, we had people like

09:49.644 --> 09:53.269
Mary Bassett. And we brought in some experts from 
across the country to talk to that first group that

09:53.289 --> 10:01.341
were the field test. And that became really the 
first model. We sent that to the Texas Education

10:05.026 --> 10:09.593
Agency.

10:10.282 --> 10:24.919
It seemed to have a good impact, so it surprised 
everyone that Texas A&M, which was so new to this

10:10.282 --> 10:24.919
field, would be the ones to come up with the first 
endorsement of a kindergarten certificate. So do

10:25.420 --> 10:33.910
you think, does that mean then that actually A&M 
was in the forefront from the beginning as a

10:25.420 --> 10:33.910
college of education, not so much that it you know, 
evolved from infancy to, I mean, in other words, it

10:34.312 --> 10:39.679
came on pretty strong from the very beginning. 
Yes, and I think that reputation, it took a long

10:39.699 --> 10:46.548
time, you know, for people to recognize that. I 
think now, you know, if you talk to people across

10:47.710 --> 10:54.880
the state, I think they like what Texas A&M has done 
as teacher. How about nationwide? Does it stand

10:56.782 --> 10:58.224
still? No, we still, no, we suffer that same image 
that we suffered back in 67. People just don't know

11:05.682 --> 11:08.888
outside the state. They just don't know what Texas 
A&M is.

11:14.518 --> 11:26.340
Normally if you run into people who have never been 
here or are not part of the Southwest Conference,

11:14.518 --> 11:26.340
their first question is, where is that? So you're 
not talking about the College of Education as

11:26.607 --> 11:30.192
such, but just A&M in general? A&M in general, and 
therefore we're caught up in, of course, the

11:30.312 --> 11:35.861
College of Education. What about the emphasis on 
research? I mean, of course, this was more major

11:38.745 --> 11:40.928
service. It's been a subtle shift. In those days, I 
think you would have called it more scholarly

11:43.853 --> 11:48.740
productivity. What we were doing research-wise 
would have been scholarly productivity. It's

11:53.270 --> 12:18.552
only in recent years, probably the last three 
years, that there's been this very subtle shift

11:53.270 --> 12:18.552
to, although scholarly research is still done, 
there's a shift to recognizing dollars, how much

11:53.270 --> 12:18.552
money is coming in that can be earmarked as 
grantsmanship money, which is the standard. type

12:19.139 --> 12:25.645
of criterion that research universities have 
used for years to measure their productivity. How

12:25.665 --> 12:31.650
many dollars can you bring in from outside funds as 
far as your research goes? Now, I have picked up

12:32.671 --> 12:41.419
from other interviews that Dean Hubert's 
emphasis was that you don't fill a college with

12:32.671 --> 12:41.419
soft monies. Is that what you're referring to, the 
grants that you need to have it? Hard money. You

12:46.223 --> 12:48.405
need to have state support. Right. And the 
university needs to provide that undergirding,

12:49.143 --> 12:54.790
that foundation, if you're going to have a solid 
program. So has that changed then now? Is there

12:56.192 --> 12:59.076
more emphasis on the soft monies, or is it still 
pretty? No, I think you still have to have that

12:59.096 --> 13:04.903
basic foundation that Dean Huber talked about. 
But I think with the new administration across the

13:05.504 --> 13:15.657
whole university, there's more recognition 
being given to outside funding supplementing or

13:16.582 --> 13:21.928
complementing what you're doing. Because again, 
see, that's how your ranking and ratings with your

13:22.008 --> 13:28.736
peers across the country come about. And I think 
the recent Carnegie labeling of universities and

13:28.756 --> 13:36.585
colleges in the United States bears that out. 
There are only two, level one. research

13:39.059 --> 13:43.466
universities in the entire state of Texas, UT 
Austin, Texas A&M. None of the others in the state

13:43.506 --> 13:46.911
made that level one. In fact, they didn't make 
level two. You have to drop to the third

13:49.495 --> 13:55.505
classification before you start picking up 
Houston, Tech, and the rest. Tell me about the

13:55.525 --> 14:04.459
Center for Teaching Excellence and how that came 
about, because I know that's your... Oh, about

13:55.525 --> 14:04.459
1971, I started teaching the EDCI 601 college 
teaching course. And I had a few teaching

14:12.575 --> 14:18.241
assistants out of chemistry in that course. And 
they kept going back and telling their

14:19.362 --> 14:29.973
coordinator, who at that time was Dr. David 
Brooks, who's now at the University of Nebraska,

14:19.362 --> 14:29.973
about what we were doing in this course. And they 
were saying everybody should have that. So Dave

14:33.278 --> 14:39.805
Brooks talked to me, and I said, why don't we run a 
one-week workshop for him? So we set up a workshop.

14:41.386 --> 14:48.013
And I think Dave had about, let's say, 30 chemistry 
TAs come in for a week. And to really recognize his

14:48.794 --> 14:55.401
interest, he sat in with them. He attended every 
session of that five-day workshop. By the time

15:00.228 --> 15:09.505
Thursday came, they were saying, this is great, we 
need to get Dean Kunze from the graduate college

15:00.228 --> 15:09.505
over here. So Kunze did agree to come over that 
Friday morning, and they hammered away at George

15:09.525 --> 15:21.226
for about an hour about how great this was, and T.A. 
should have this, and they ought to get

15:21.246 --> 15:24.632
recognition for it, and so forth. So that was, to 
me, the first thing that was going to lay the

15:25.523 --> 15:33.916
groundwork for a center, because Kunze did 
respond to that. He went to the academic policy

15:33.976 --> 15:39.004
people, the deans and vice presidents. And the 
very next year, they offered graduate assistants

15:39.024 --> 15:49.320
teaching an extra $25 per month, stipend if they 
took a special course that I then set up for the

15:50.144 --> 15:53.788
teaching assistants. I closed it at 48. We had 48 
enroll in that, which was a big... Was that the

15:55.950 --> 16:00.255
first one? That was the first one. Well, then the 
economic... What course, excuse me one second,

16:01.856 --> 16:05.320
what course was that? What was it called? I want to 
say it was called 678. Under what department? It

16:11.627 --> 16:12.908
was in EDCI. ED? EDCI, Education and Criterion. 
Yeah, right. Okay, EDCI and... I think it was

16:17.713 --> 16:19.375
called 678. And it was a teaching of? I think it was 
the analysis of college teaching. OK. I'll look

16:26.523 --> 16:27.024
that up. But that course is defunct now. OK. And the 
history of that is because during that first year

16:31.349 --> 16:39.199
is when the economy fell out in the state. And they 
didn't have that kind of money. And when you don't

16:41.731 --> 16:45.335
have the money and the carrot, then you don't have 
the enrollment. What was that year again, when you

16:45.375 --> 16:49.040
had the 48 students? That must have been... I can 
probably look

16:52.805 --> 16:57.771
that up. I

16:58.091 --> 17:02.116
think that was in 1972. Okay. If you have anything, 
any documents or things that might contribute to

17:02.256 --> 17:11.147
the demographics or the... I would be happy to make 
copies and bring them back to you.

17:22.746 --> 17:27.591
This will be interesting for me to look up again. At 
your old book? Uh-huh.

17:31.716 --> 17:33.298
So then there was no center at the time. It was just a 
course. No, it was just a course. That's right,

17:36.401 --> 17:37.382
just a course. And the center then did not actually 
become... a center as such until what year? Let's

17:44.803 --> 17:48.108
see, 1983, January 16, 1983. And where did the 
funding come from? The initial funding came from

17:51.693 --> 17:57.981
the development office, and that was the first 
year. And then the second year, it came from the

17:58.101 --> 18:07.414
Permanent University Fund, Available Fund from 
the Permanent University Fund. And we have been on

18:07.434 --> 18:09.737
those funds ever since.

18:12.316 --> 18:19.667
How

18:12.316 --> 18:19.667
many people on your staff? I have one full-time 
secretary, and I have one full-time training

18:20.768 --> 18:35.790
specialist, and I have one graduate assistant on 
teaching, and one work study. Do you also still

18:35.810 --> 18:37.432
teach? Yes. NADCI? NADCI. What courses? EDCI 601, 
college teaching. EDCI 6...

18:45.968 --> 18:51.676
No, it doesn't matter. It's the special topics 
course. Okay, now, what is the primary function of

18:54.660 --> 18:57.905
the center right now? Okay, I can give that to you. 
Okay.

19:03.652 --> 19:05.555
History and the functions. Thank you. OK. And I've 
been getting some of the newsletters. Do you still

19:10.383 --> 19:11.324
publish that? Yes. On a, let's see, is it how? 
Monthly basis. A monthly basis. Just September

19:15.509 --> 19:19.213
through May. And what kind of collaborative 
effort do you have with other departments and

19:19.233 --> 19:26.221
other colleges? Do you work very closely with? 
What I use is a network. I have one representative

19:30.166 --> 19:33.910
from each of the 10 academic colleges. So I do wear 
two hats for the College of Education. The dean

19:37.901 --> 19:41.125
just asked me to play both roles. And we meet a 
couple of times a year just to coordinate and talk

19:42.387 --> 19:49.857
about issues and directions. And I get ideas from 
them. So anything that I do, I usually work through

19:51.759 --> 20:01.112
the representative who stays in touch with his 
college dean. For example, we give out $1,000

20:02.408 --> 20:09.819
incentive grants to faculty members who want to do 
something innovative in teaching. Those flow

20:10.880 --> 20:14.385
through that representative. So they know what 
their allocation is, and then if they have 10

20:14.405 --> 20:24.019
applicants and only three $1,000 awards, they 
narrow those 10 down to three. They send those over

20:24.940 --> 20:29.547
to me, and I'm the last check on the proposal, and if 
it's fine, good. I just transfer the money over to

20:30.421 --> 20:33.044
their college. And then they're in charge of the 
bookkeeping at the college, the dean's level, in

20:34.306 --> 20:41.995
charge of the bookkeeping. When they're through, 
they send the final report to me, which we file. Can

20:50.444 --> 20:59.415
you tell me a little bit, perhaps over these many 
years that you've been here, maybe either a

20:50.444 --> 20:59.415
highlight or what you feel maybe has been your your 
greatest contribution, or even an observation of

20:59.969 --> 21:06.496
something that I might not find in these documents 
that would be stringent? I would have to identify

21:06.696 --> 21:18.469
the Center for Teaching Excellence

21:06.696 --> 21:18.469
even more so than the four and a half years as head of 
that new department of curriculum instruction.

21:18.489 --> 21:22.813
Those were growth years and very critical years. 
Because when the old Department of Education

21:23.914 --> 21:28.339
closed, It had 1,800 majors. And when the new 
college opened, our department had 1,800 majors,

21:32.175 --> 21:42.128
which was beyond any projection that had been 
laid. So we were short on graduate assistants. We

21:45.593 --> 21:47.416
were short on faculty members. We were short on 
resources. And those first half years were

21:49.902 --> 21:52.966
critical building years. So you were the first 
head of the EDCI. And what year was that when we got

21:56.530 --> 21:59.254
organized? When

21:59.674 --> 22:08.645
I stepped down, that's what they gave me. Well, 
then it was the same year. In other words, did the

22:11.128 --> 22:15.474
department open when the college opened? It was 
part of the new college. Yes. The only departments

22:18.290 --> 22:40.112
that existed at the time were the departments of 
health and physical education, which was in the

22:18.290 --> 22:40.112
arts and sciences, the department of ag 
education, which is a liaison arrangement, the

22:18.290 --> 22:40.112
department of industrial education, which was 
with engineering, and the old department of

22:18.290 --> 22:40.112
education. And they simply split the old 
department of education into three new

22:40.132 --> 22:44.517
departments. Oh, OK. EDCI, Ed Administration, 
and Ed Psych. And the majors within education then

22:49.576 --> 22:56.185
chose which of these five they were going to. 
Health and PE, Industrial Ed, EDCI, Ed

22:56.225 --> 23:01.411
Administration, or Ed Psych. And you ended up with 
18? That's right. 1,800. And that was all there was

23:05.477 --> 23:08.540
in the whole department before? College. Does 
that mean that they all chose EDCI? No. What

23:11.644 --> 23:12.846
happened is you had Again, a tremendous growth 
factor so that you'd have to check, but I'll bet Ed

23:13.096 --> 23:24.169
Psych probably opened to about 300 and Ed Aid to 
probably about 300. But we opened to 1,800. And, of

23:27.793 --> 23:34.281
course, it lost a number of faculty members to Ed 
Psych and Ed Administration. So those were

23:35.463 --> 23:41.770
formative years, but I would still say the center 
has been my most exciting work. Because Dean

23:42.644 --> 23:55.542
Hubert and I tried two different times from around 
1972 till he stepped down to get a center

23:42.644 --> 23:55.542
established. And there were always too many 
priorities. The growth of the university was too

23:57.645 --> 24:04.174
great, and they could not come up with the funding. 
It was when Dean Corrigan came in and the

24:04.194 --> 24:10.963
committees were formed that they finally could 
catch their breath a little bit. And that's when

24:11.585 --> 24:16.637
they formed the center.

24:17.679 --> 24:25.416
Do you see anything in the near future or even the 
more distant future that will impact the College

24:17.679 --> 24:25.416
of Education? I know there's some really scary 
things going on right now that people are very

24:26.789 --> 24:33.959
apprehensive about besides the economy, just the 
changes in education and the reforms. Oh, I see.

24:34.760 --> 24:35.361
Sure. What do you perceive the future to be for the 
college, like, say, from the year 2000 and beyond,

24:35.701 --> 24:42.050
possibly? It all depends on the economy. Because 
without the money, you just can't do it. Now, if the

24:49.781 --> 24:56.290
resources are there, we may see some very dramatic 
shifts. We may see more collaboration between the

24:56.675 --> 25:03.183
university and the public school setting. 
Although I think it's good now, I think there'll be

25:03.203 --> 25:08.590
even more take place. I think you may see, in the 
21st century, you may see more efforts to become

25:08.970 --> 25:25.450
more technologically oriented, more 
interactive television, more work with

25:08.970 --> 25:25.450
microcomputers. But again, see, that's all tied 
into the economy. If you don't have the money, you

25:28.951 --> 25:31.896
can't move that direction. I think the last 
estimate I saw to completely establish two

25:31.916 --> 25:46.859
locations with interactive television ran about 
close to $400,000, say, for two locations. Well,

25:46.879 --> 25:49.002
that's a lot of money. Do you feel that the center, 
though, in itself is pretty secure? I have no idea.

25:55.232 --> 26:00.137
Does it come up year after year for refunding or how 
does that work? It's a good question. I think all

26:02.339 --> 26:19.254
centers and all non-line

26:02.339 --> 26:19.254
item operations are always looked at annually in 
light of the economics of the whole situation. For

26:21.056 --> 26:22.217
example, when When you want to move in a certain 
direction and you need the monies and you don't

26:22.433 --> 26:33.683
have it from the state, then the only place you can 
look is the available fund. And you have to look and

26:33.703 --> 26:37.967
see what's in the available fund. And are there 
places where you need to cut back in order to get

26:38.087 --> 26:43.592
this new thrust? So in that light, everyone would 
be vulnerable. Co-op, continuing ed, study

26:47.856 --> 26:51.259
abroad, international programs, name any of the 
programs that are operating out of available

26:51.745 --> 26:58.371
funds. They can become vulnerable if a new thrust 
comes. Very good. Is there anything that we

27:04.697 --> 27:12.225
haven't covered that I had in the questions that 
you might have wanted to discuss? What I'm looking

27:12.385 --> 27:20.993
at in my paper is the Hubert era and the Corrigan era 
and then of course a little bit of the interim under

27:21.428 --> 27:28.176
Dr. Limbacher, I'm not going to do leadership 
styles as such because that would be too involved.

27:28.196 --> 27:35.705
Just more of the perceptions of the individuals 
that were here because so many of them have been

27:28.196 --> 27:35.705
here since the beginning. And a lot of it is 
attributed to Dean Hubert's ability to tap the...

27:35.965 --> 27:48.820
Yeah, I don't think the College of Education would 
have moved as quickly if it hadn't been for Frank

27:35.965 --> 27:48.820
Hubert. I think he knew the state. He knew the 
politics of the state. He knew how to, quote,

27:52.643 --> 28:04.502
grease the tracks so that this thing could become 
operational in less than two years from the time it

27:52.643 --> 28:04.502
was proposed, which is a remarkable feat. But it's 
kind of like Earl Rudder. See, Earl Rudder's the

28:06.965 --> 28:13.255
only one who could have made this a co-educational 
university.

28:13.775 --> 28:20.765
I think during the Hubert era, I would say the 
thrust was internal within the state. The

28:20.785 --> 28:29.717
concentration was to establish ourselves with 
the agency, with the coordinating board, with the

28:20.785 --> 28:29.717
people of the state of Texas. Under Corrigan, he 
has continued with that thrust, but we have moved

28:29.737 --> 28:42.175
into more of a national light with the Holmes study 
and other efforts. And of course, Corrigan came.

28:44.521 --> 28:48.406
from a national background and national 
reputation. So it's a logical transition to move

28:48.507 --> 29:02.666
from focus internally within the state to focus 
more, retain that, but also start looking at your

28:48.507 --> 29:02.666
image nationally. And I think that will pay 
dividends eventually. Is it a very gradual? Oh, my

29:07.753 --> 29:11.338
guess is a 10 to 15 year gap. In other words, if we 
were doing 15 years from now exactly what we're

29:11.977 --> 29:21.230
doing today, we would have far more recognition 15 
years from now. It's that gap that's there before

29:21.350 --> 29:31.284
people say, oh, Texas A&M is a college of 
education, and recognize what it does. Do you feel

29:31.304 --> 29:33.667
that there will always be a college of education? 
I'm even picking up some comments like, well,

29:33.727 --> 29:38.294
maybe there won't even be one, but I've never 
really... I feel... Now, I have no evidence of

29:39.314 --> 29:51.205
this, but I feel like places like Texas A&M and UT 
Austin in particular need a college of education.

29:51.225 --> 29:53.748
They're supposed to be the flagship 
universities. They should be doing the best work

29:53.768 --> 29:58.772
possible in all fields. And education is one of the 
fields. So I think a college of education should do

30:02.856 --> 30:05.659
this. And we'll survive, hopefully. Hopefully. 
Even though there are going to be probably some

30:09.639 --> 30:14.567
drastic changes, even in the teacher 
preparation. Will that affect your center at all?

30:16.310 --> 30:16.490
No. Center is a separate entity. It's the 
university center for teaching excellence.

30:23.321 --> 30:23.862
Right. Of course, directly to the office of 
provost. It is not detached to any department or

30:26.626 --> 30:30.212
college. Now, I have tremendous benefits being 
attached to the College of Education because Dean

30:32.437 --> 30:42.648
Corrigan and Bill Peters have recognized the 
contribution of the Center. So I probably have

30:42.728 --> 30:49.855
some benefits that others might not enjoy as much 
because they've been very supportive. Dr.

30:51.397 --> 30:59.085
Johnson, I really appreciate your time and your 
effort and I think it's wonderful and I want to keep

30:51.397 --> 30:59.085
on getting these newsletters.
