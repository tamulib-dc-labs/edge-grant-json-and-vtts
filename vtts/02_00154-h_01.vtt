00:03.592 --> 00:08.237
This is Sunday, the 21st of May. Just now pulling 
out of the driveway of the house, heading toward

00:09.939 --> 00:27.777
Kerrville for a meeting of the Shriner Board, 
hoping to do some more recollecting

00:09.939 --> 00:27.777
of years at A&M.

00:32.279 --> 00:44.054
Since I'm not positive where I quit with the 
previous

00:32.279 --> 00:44.054
tapes, I apologize in advance for any repetition 
that may occur. Now I'm going to stop and see if this

00:44.194 --> 00:46.517
machine is working.

00:53.586 --> 00:57.291
First, a little more of a retrospective of Mr. 
Rutter.

01:04.004 --> 01:29.337
Since we did not know of his

01:04.004 --> 01:29.337
decline in physical health, almost none of us had

01:04.004 --> 01:29.337
paused to

01:04.004 --> 01:29.337
stop and evaluate all that he had accomplished and 
all that he had meant to the institution. In

01:36.591 --> 02:00.505
addition to the fact that he was not vulnerable to 
allegations of not being a Texan or an Aggie or not

01:36.591 --> 02:00.505
having been in the Corps or anything like this,

01:36.591 --> 02:00.505
it seldom occurred to any of us that another 
advantage he possessed

02:01.160 --> 02:28.450
was the fact that without the

02:01.160 --> 02:28.450
years of graduate study,

02:01.160 --> 02:28.450
master's thesis, doctoral dissertation, term 
papers, and all that the rest of us possessed, He

02:30.218 --> 02:53.111
was able to see to the heart of things perhaps more 
clearly

02:30.218 --> 02:53.111
than

02:30.218 --> 02:53.111
most academic eggheads would have been able to 
view.

02:53.131 --> 02:57.998
He was a true leader, able to make decisions

03:01.066 --> 03:12.681
rather clearly and certainly he stood strongly 
for everything in which he had a belief and

03:01.066 --> 03:12.681
confidence.

03:20.972 --> 03:29.082
I'm convinced that his initial

03:20.972 --> 03:29.082
hesitation dash and possibly even opposition, 
Dash,

03:29.551 --> 03:56.470
to the traumatic changes of the early 60s, 
coeducation,

03:29.551 --> 03:56.470
voluntary Corps of Cadets, racial integration,

03:29.551 --> 03:56.470
and

03:29.551 --> 03:56.470
general... academic changes including

03:57.310 --> 04:17.875
admission requirements

03:57.310 --> 04:17.875
plus curriculum breadth and depth.

04:17.895 --> 04:26.305
That

04:17.895 --> 04:26.305
his hesitancy

04:17.895 --> 04:26.305
on those came from his concern over whether or not 
he could succeed in that campaign.

04:37.641 --> 04:55.228
Thus the former field commander as he looked at the 
battle plan at first

04:37.641 --> 04:55.228
it now seems that he

04:56.204 --> 05:20.697
delayed the attack until he was

04:56.204 --> 05:20.697
more positive about the probability of victory 
for his campaign.

05:20.717 --> 05:25.603
He tended to be a

05:26.140 --> 05:53.397
leader

05:26.140 --> 05:53.397
who

05:26.140 --> 05:53.397
would personally go to the academic front line,

05:26.140 --> 05:53.397
whether it be

05:26.140 --> 05:53.397
to Washington, Austin,

05:26.140 --> 05:53.397
an A&M board meeting,

05:57.275 --> 06:19.245
session with deans or faculty or a march by the 
students on his house, he would be there

05:57.275 --> 06:19.245
personally to make very clear,

05:57.275 --> 06:19.245
usually, that he had made the decision and would 
stand behind it. Paragraph, a number of us heard

06:21.728 --> 06:23.991
him

06:27.717 --> 06:57.488
identify himself as the Potbellied Prexy

06:27.717 --> 06:57.488
which was in part

06:27.717 --> 06:57.488
his way of claiming links to A&M's traditions

06:27.717 --> 06:57.488
because in his day the chief executive office, the 
president, as the chief executive officer was

06:58.885 --> 07:06.413
known in the Corps as the Prexy. In addition, that 
physical identification

07:08.876 --> 07:28.437
was his way of saying, most often with a smile,

07:08.876 --> 07:28.437
that he wasn't vain,

07:32.534 --> 07:45.070
nor did he spend much time worrying about whether 
or not he was clothed

07:32.534 --> 07:45.070
in the latest style.

07:49.175 --> 07:56.044
He was in fact

07:49.175 --> 07:56.044
ready to do his best

08:02.335 --> 08:17.922
and would take the responsibility

08:02.335 --> 08:17.922
for such a venture.

08:17.943 --> 08:19.125
But then he was gone.

08:23.452 --> 08:25.035
The arrival of Dr. Williams

08:32.120 --> 08:35.544
brought some change in style.

08:38.807 --> 08:49.539
He was far more outgoing and

08:38.807 --> 08:49.539
was a very skilled speaker.

08:53.684 --> 09:01.232
In those speeches,

08:53.684 --> 09:01.232
it seemed to a casual observer that he was almost

09:03.136 --> 09:15.890
speaking extemporaneously.

09:15.910 --> 09:27.343
Now it is obvious that his remarks were carefully 
planned.

09:27.363 --> 09:31.708
He had a very private reservoir

09:32.600 --> 09:53.708
file of notes, anecdotes, jokes, et cetera,

09:32.600 --> 09:53.708
most of which he could deliver flawlessly.

09:58.575 --> 10:00.177
He seemed particularly able to speak at the level 
of his audience,

10:02.587 --> 10:29.877
whether it be

10:02.587 --> 10:29.877
Aggie undergraduates,

10:02.587 --> 10:29.877
A&M Mothers Clubs,

10:02.587 --> 10:29.877
legislators,

10:35.003 --> 10:43.812
and was particularly skillful at a general 
meeting of the general faculty.

10:43.832 --> 10:53.921
There he caused almost all of us to walk away 
saying, this is the man we've been waiting for.

10:58.746 --> 11:01.669
Paragraph once more, his experience at Clemson.

11:06.678 --> 11:34.558
which was far more similar in its background 
experience to A&M than we realized at the time,

11:06.678 --> 11:34.558
helped him to understand

11:06.678 --> 11:34.558
very, very well

11:06.678 --> 11:34.558
how to relate to such audiences.

11:41.400 --> 11:53.594
Occasionally, some of us could remember hearing

11:41.400 --> 11:53.594
a Williams story for a second time. For example, 
the classic account of the man trying

11:53.614 --> 12:05.068
to raise the load of bricks in a pulley system, in 
which he himself finally got involved, in which

12:06.466 --> 12:24.407
the lifter finally got involved, was himself 
lifted, then dropped, only to be hit on the head by

12:06.466 --> 12:24.407
the bricks.

12:32.056 --> 12:34.819
But he was the right man for the time,

12:38.039 --> 13:06.510
Similarly, Mrs. Williams, having been a faculty 
wife,

12:38.039 --> 13:06.510
like being part of an academic couple, like so many 
of us who had gone through the realities of student

12:38.039 --> 13:06.510
housing, in their years at Emory,

13:08.009 --> 13:38.016
then renting an apartment at Clemson, and finally 
moving to what was for them a very special dream

13:08.009 --> 13:38.016
house in

13:08.009 --> 13:38.016
a pleasant, quiet, curving, wooded street, 
timbered street not far from the campus.

13:44.155 --> 13:58.017
Dr. Williams, Dr. and Mrs. Williams had two 
daughters, thus they were sensitive to the needs

13:44.155 --> 13:58.017
of coeds.

14:00.941 --> 14:09.555
Their older daughter, being a college student 
when they arrived, and their younger during

14:11.527 --> 14:14.571
graduation at A&M Consolidated High School.

14:17.536 --> 14:38.486
Mrs. Williams

14:17.536 --> 14:38.486
instantly became very much involved in a broad 
array of campus activities

14:17.536 --> 14:38.486
and seemed more outgoing

14:17.536 --> 14:38.486
as a campus first lady than Mrs. Rudder.

14:42.442 --> 14:58.169
And one of the reasons for that perhaps was because 
the Rudder children were younger

14:42.442 --> 14:58.169
when that administration began in 1959. And

14:58.550 --> 15:06.664
with four youngsters, Mrs. Rudder

15:10.589 --> 15:12.452
Had more home duties.

15:17.178 --> 15:20.323
Also, she said to many individuals. That she 
understood from quote from Earl. Let my. Task is to

15:29.736 --> 15:32.360
raise the children and keep house.

15:35.705 --> 15:36.546
Period quote.

15:39.715 --> 15:46.942
Many of us assumed, however, that both ladies, 
Mrs. Rudder and Mrs. Williams,

15:47.002 --> 15:57.953
were quietly influential in their husbands' 
policies and roles. Paragraph.

16:03.178 --> 16:09.064
On the first occasion

16:03.178 --> 16:09.064
in which my wife and I visited the new president's 
home, as we then called it,

16:10.613 --> 16:36.486
near the south edge of the campus,

16:10.613 --> 16:36.486
I quickly

16:10.613 --> 16:36.486
expressed deep impressions with the home's size, 
beauty,

16:40.465 --> 16:45.072
and style.

16:45.092 --> 17:06.743
Instantly, Mrs. Williams replied by saying, I 
don't know where you live or what it looks like, but

16:45.092 --> 17:06.743
I will swap houses with you

16:45.092 --> 17:06.743
instantly

16:45.092 --> 17:06.743
with no extra payment.

17:12.916 --> 17:40.645
When I asked her why she felt that way,

17:12.916 --> 17:40.645
she pointed out that this was, quote, not my house,

17:12.916 --> 17:40.645
period, quote, a comma, quote, and that whatever 
arrangement she made of furnishings and

17:12.916 --> 17:40.645
something else or anything else that someone 
offered a comment about how the house had been

17:42.616 --> 18:01.740
arranged before the Williams arrived.

18:01.760 --> 18:12.133
Later as campus CEO,

18:01.760 --> 18:12.133
later when I became a campus CEO in El Paso and 
Columbia, Missouri, My wife and I became far more

18:13.177 --> 18:20.967
sensitive to the realities of such changes.

18:24.551 --> 18:34.885
The Williamses

18:24.551 --> 18:34.885
had many groups over to the president's home.

18:38.649 --> 18:43.015
And they were always particularly proud that the 
first group that came the night they moved in was

18:43.670 --> 19:10.605
the Aggie Corps of Cadets led by the A&M band to 
welcome them

18:43.670 --> 19:10.605
with appropriate quote maroon sounding quote 
tunes to ensure that they knew they were very

19:11.378 --> 19:17.406
deeply appreciated at their new home.

19:23.594 --> 19:25.176
Now this is a note to the typist. I think I have 
already dictated a bit about the first

19:25.277 --> 19:40.677
conversation with Dr. Williams after he got here. 
and also Dr. Calhoun asking me to come over and join

19:42.445 --> 19:50.734
him. Now I want to jump back and talk about teaching 
at A&M, and we will have to insert this earlier at

19:53.057 --> 20:09.094
some point in the tapes chronologically.

20:17.309 --> 20:33.124
Teaching has always been, for me,

20:17.309 --> 20:33.124
by far the most satisfying part of academic 
service.

20:44.613 --> 21:09.186
in using the word quote teaching quote

20:44.613 --> 21:09.186
I am including not only the instruction in formal 
classes

20:44.613 --> 21:09.186
but the countless other opportunities for 
student contact

21:13.317 --> 21:41.535
and always in an office conversation,

21:13.317 --> 21:41.535
service on committees and other advisory groups 
with students, DASH, or any other opportunity for

21:13.317 --> 21:41.535
student contact.

21:47.928 --> 22:17.665
paragraph in my opinion

21:47.928 --> 22:17.665
teaching is a calling

21:47.928 --> 22:17.665
and somehow that idea came into my heart when I and 
others used to get frustrated at Austin College

21:47.928 --> 22:17.665
when we would hear some speaker particularly at 
compulsory chapel services on Tuesday and

22:18.893 --> 22:46.032
Thursday mornings at 10 o'clock

22:18.893 --> 22:46.032
talked to us about, quote, full-time Christian 
service, quote, dash, which those speakers

22:18.893 --> 22:46.032
usually

22:18.893 --> 22:46.032
limited to the ordained clergy

22:53.369 --> 23:22.110
This observer,

22:53.369 --> 23:22.110
hopefully using

22:53.369 --> 23:22.110
what is consistent with the Calvinist beliefs 
that have run in the family for many generations,

22:53.369 --> 23:22.110
is convinced

22:53.369 --> 23:22.110
that every individual

23:22.917 --> 23:48.857
may be called to, quote, full-time Christian 
service, quote, dash,

23:22.917 --> 23:48.857
in a truly broad variety of professional tasks.

23:52.972 --> 24:20.177
My inspirations, some of which were realized at 
the time and some certainly were not,

23:52.972 --> 24:20.177
were Faced Range from the third grade, Grace Glaze 
from the fourth,

23:52.972 --> 24:20.177
Myrtmae Force from junior high,

24:27.582 --> 24:45.320
and

24:27.582 --> 24:45.320
then Mr. Sidner from Austin College,

24:27.582 --> 24:45.320
Elmer Flaccus,

24:27.582 --> 24:45.320
and a number of people at Rice.

24:51.105 --> 24:56.931
I never had a formal course from Frank Vandiver, 
but I certainly have always felt marked by his

24:58.835 --> 25:25.787
splendid

24:58.835 --> 25:25.787
and sometimes incredible ability to retain, 
organize, and share factual information in a

24:58.835 --> 25:25.787
meaningful manner. Another Rice faculty member 
who was important in my teaching development was

25:28.062 --> 25:54.087
Ed Phillips,

25:28.062 --> 25:54.087
who one day asked me for advice about whether or not 
he should accept an Austin College appointment,

25:28.062 --> 25:54.087
and I proudly and happily encouraged him to accept 
it.

25:57.458 --> 26:12.794
He served there for three decades or more and now 
has been elected an honorary member of one of the

25:57.458 --> 26:12.794
rice classes back in the 50s.

26:22.544 --> 26:24.866
Paragraph. The sum of all of those the influence 
from all of those teachers and many others

26:27.817 --> 26:56.001
caused me to believe that

26:27.817 --> 26:56.001
teaching history at the university level

26:27.817 --> 26:56.001
should have as its focus

26:27.817 --> 26:56.001
an understanding of how this great nation came to 
be what it is and to try to present that information

26:56.470 --> 27:18.884
in such a fashion

26:56.470 --> 27:18.884
that we might even dream

26:56.470 --> 27:18.884
of greater progress in the future.

27:22.850 --> 27:23.811
But while

27:27.993 --> 27:51.922
looking forward, be well aware

27:27.993 --> 27:51.922
of the reality that this nation is the world's 
pacemaker

27:27.993 --> 27:51.922
in so many positive ways.

27:51.942 --> 27:52.362
Paragraph.

27:55.126 --> 27:56.127
Every semester, from the fall of 1959 until

27:57.288 --> 28:24.112
our departure from Missouri

27:57.288 --> 28:24.112
following the spring semester in 1997, I taught at 
least one big survey section in US history.

28:24.132 --> 28:25.894
The first years at A&M There were four sections

28:28.237 --> 28:32.723
per semester. Most of them were History 105, 
taking the study of the U.S. up through the Civil

28:34.586 --> 28:41.876
War. But some were History 106, the second 
semester, for the more recent period.

29:02.037 --> 29:29.226
In those courses,

29:02.037 --> 29:29.226
I used a lecture outline,

29:02.037 --> 29:29.226
which I normally would write on the blackboard 
prior to the beginning of a lecture.

29:31.990 --> 29:54.945
That meant that I always tried to get to class 10 to 
15 minutes before the beginning of that session

29:31.990 --> 29:54.945
and put the key points of that lecture on the board. 
In addition, I tried to be particularly careful

30:01.302 --> 30:29.233
about names of places, individuals, battles,

30:01.302 --> 30:29.233
acts of legislation, et cetera,

30:01.302 --> 30:29.233
that the members of the class might not quickly 
recognize some sound

30:31.390 --> 30:59.642
and or might not be able to spell correctly

30:31.390 --> 30:59.642
as we proceeded

30:31.390 --> 30:59.642
as the first day of the of the class arrived,

31:01.630 --> 31:19.791
I tried to pass out as quickly as possible a

31:01.630 --> 31:19.791
three or four page

31:01.630 --> 31:19.791
quote syllabus.
