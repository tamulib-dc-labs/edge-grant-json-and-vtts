WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:07.316
There's a tape that's supposed to ring on this 
thing and tell us when we're out of time, but the

00:01.583 --> 00:07.316
truth of the matter is the damn thing doesn't do it. 
And so I got to be careful because I don't want to

00:07.557 --> 00:11.626
lose anything.

00:14.773 --> 00:20.065
I like, you know, the first series of questions 
really have to do with how did you develop an

00:14.773 --> 00:20.065
interest in oceanography? All right. That is 
undergraduate and graduate. In general here, you

00:23.765 --> 00:26.809
are going to be asking me questions, and then I... 
I'm going to be asking you questions and letting

00:27.150 --> 00:32.076
you answer them, and sometimes I'm going to let you 
wandering off all the way. That's what I was really

00:32.457 --> 00:33.999
wondering about. So basically, you start off 
asking me questions, and you hope there's a fair

00:34.019 --> 00:39.186
amount of wonder. Yeah, right. All right. What was 
your early training in? You were trained as a

00:47.618 --> 00:49.841
physicist, right? I was trained as a physicist. 
And how did you develop your interest in physics?

00:56.529 --> 01:08.683
Well, I guess I was just interested in things, 
fooled around with automobiles and motorcycles a

00:56.529 --> 01:08.683
little bit. And the telephone company did a lot of 
us a great favor by having a junk pile that we were

01:08.743 --> 01:16.292
free to use and exploit.

01:21.569 --> 01:28.519
Uh, high school, I was, I was brought up in, uh, born 
and brought up in Garrettsville, Ohio, a little

01:21.569 --> 01:28.519
south of Cleveland. Uh, very fortunate in having a 
very pleasant, instructive family, exceedingly

01:28.539 --> 01:38.172
good teachers in school. In, uh, college, I went to 
Hiram College, which was, uh, four miles away

01:46.850 --> 02:16.114
during depression lived at home

01:46.850 --> 02:16.114
did a worked for basically for many years and 
summers and spare time etc on for a fellow who ran a

01:46.850 --> 02:16.114
local greenhouse

01:46.850 --> 02:16.114
and who also he and another fellow did contracting 
so I got kind of a wide experience of utilizing your

02:17.090 --> 02:26.564
hands and doing an extremely large variety of 
peon-like jobs, which was probably very good for

02:17.090 --> 02:26.564
me. Hiram College was small, with a population of 
about 400 when I was there.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.646
Most people knew nearly everybody else.

02:42.706 --> 02:48.513
a building about the size of this present building 
we're in, the Oceanographic Institution's first

02:42.706 --> 02:48.513
building. It housed all of the science 
departments, and we were very fortunate that we

02:49.895 --> 02:57.704
had exceedingly good one-man departments. From 
the time you were a sophomore on, if you were

02:59.126 --> 03:05.314
serious about your business, you were treated 
like a graduate student. The sophomores taught

03:06.535 --> 03:10.620
laboratories for the freshmen, juniors taught 
laboratories for the Southmores and the seniors

03:10.904 --> 03:15.690
taught laboratories for the juniors. And I also 
had a WPA job to build instrumentation for

03:17.212 --> 03:29.567
exhibits and lectures and things like this.

03:34.433 --> 03:37.857
The graduates for When I was considering graduate 
school, I didn't really see how I could swing it. As

03:47.988 --> 03:51.531
the professor said, my grades were good enough in 
some of my sciences. And my grades in some of the

03:51.912 --> 04:04.303
other things were a little too abominable to make 
the grade in the Depression when the competition

03:51.912 --> 04:04.303
was so tough.

04:06.065 --> 04:07.506
Happily for me, a classmate of mine who had a 
graduate assistantship at Lehigh University. At

04:14.064 --> 04:30.826
the very last moment, he got an opportunity to go to 
a better job, and he suggested me, and so in about

04:14.064 --> 04:30.826
the last week of summer, I got an opportunity to go 
to Lehigh University in Pennsylvania.

04:34.791 --> 04:35.772
This was... There I had the very good fortune to, 
arriving a couple of days early to get my feet on the

04:37.945 --> 04:53.811
ground, I was put in an office with Morris Ewing,

04:37.945 --> 04:53.811
who was assistant professor there at that time. He 
was busily at work on geophysical work, preparing

04:55.614 --> 05:04.088
a crystal clock for gravity at sea measurements in 
submarines. And after about two minutes of

05:05.266 --> 05:11.794
pleasantry, he put me to work in a profession. And 
he turned out to be a pretty good slave driver for

05:11.874 --> 05:21.165
pretty much not only the next four years, but much 
of the next decade. I didn't know he'd ever been at

05:21.566 --> 05:23.228
Lehigh. Yes. What did he teach at Lehigh? Well, he 
taught mostly sophomore physics. And then he

05:31.999 --> 05:34.041
taught geophysics. He

05:35.843 --> 06:02.948
did a wide variety of really small things in 
working with some of the mining people, Bethlehem

05:35.843 --> 06:02.948
Steel, in geophysics, some electrical work, some 
work sound vibrations in the ice, things like

06:04.497 --> 06:08.884
this. And he attracted the attention in about 35, 
something like this, or 34, of

06:09.245 --> 06:32.361
Dr. Richard Field, who was a professor of geology 
at Princeton and is certainly one of the great

06:09.245 --> 06:32.361
heroes of of modern geology and certainly plate 
tectonics, because he and William Bowie from the

06:32.645 --> 06:55.159
Coaster Bay were leaders in the feeling that 
somehow or other geology was getting on a plateau,

06:32.645 --> 06:55.159
and classical geologists working on land-borne 
geology. we're sort of reaching a law diminishing

06:57.198 --> 07:15.187
returns, and because most of the Earth's surface 
was water, we knew so little about the geology at

06:57.198 --> 07:15.187
sea that it was probable that the next big steps 
would be in the sea. So as I sometimes put it, that

07:15.207 --> 07:24.302
although Dick Field was considered to be a funny 
person by by many even before he had his automobile

07:25.109 --> 07:53.985
accident and certainly very funny after that he 
was a true fundamentalist and he had the vision to

07:25.109 --> 07:53.985
both see and to encourage some few young 
whippersnapper professors like Harry Hess at

07:25.109 --> 07:53.985
Princeton and Morris Ewing at Lehigh that the real 
future of geology lay in the sea and If they looked

07:54.758 --> 08:03.208
in that direction, he would back them to the hilt 
with everything that he could, and they might make

07:54.758 --> 08:03.208
a reputation for themselves. It certainly turned 
out to be true. At the time I arrived, he and

08:06.852 --> 08:23.230
Dr. Bowie from the Coast Guard had been very 
effective in getting US submarines follow the

08:23.513 --> 08:30.823
path of the Dutch submarine Navy when they 
supported venting Midas and making gravity

08:23.513 --> 08:30.823
measurements at sea.

08:33.887 --> 08:43.239
The field had talked the Bell Telephone 
Laboratories into making the first of the crystal

08:33.887 --> 08:43.239
clocks. Incidentally, is this a crystal clock? 
Watch. Don't know.

08:53.072 --> 08:53.352
Well. It doesn't make any noise. What it is is a 695 
Timex. That's

08:58.093 --> 09:01.877
my bad ear. But in this day and age of crystal 
watches that run for a year on your wrist, it is

09:02.437 --> 09:12.587
interesting to think about this clock, which was 
produced in about 1935. It was the first of the

09:12.727 --> 09:15.290
portable crystals. It had 180 volts of lead acid B 
batteries and was about half a relay rack. This

09:23.690 --> 09:34.488
turned out to be, for over a decade, one of the great 
timepieces of geophysics because it could be

09:23.690 --> 09:34.488
moved around at sea and in submarines.

09:41.900 --> 09:47.790
My first job was in sort of looking at the system was 
I thought perhaps

09:51.415 --> 09:52.296
Well, excuse me. One of the difficulties they had 
was the whirling wheel, the rotor of the machine,

09:53.078 --> 10:09.044
was viewed by a little crude stroboscope, which 
was triggered by WWV signals over the radio. And

10:09.324 --> 10:17.237
presumably, if there wasn't any static, every 
second you would get a pop and you could read the

10:09.324 --> 10:17.237
thing very carefully, about a thousandth of a 
second. When the static was going strong, it

10:17.943 --> 10:23.970
popped so often that it was hard to see anything but 
a blur. And having been interested in photography

10:25.291 --> 10:42.211
and taking advantage of the nonlinear 
characteristics of some of the curves having to do

10:25.291 --> 10:42.211
with illumination and film density, we built up a 
little integrating system and took pictures of

10:25.291 --> 10:42.211
it.

10:45.555 --> 10:46.836
So that was how I got in. how I got in oceanography.

10:53.055 --> 11:16.080
The work at Lehigh was primarily the normal 
geophysical graduate work with the addition of

10:53.055 --> 11:16.080
about

10:53.055 --> 11:16.080
six, administering about six laboratories a week 
for sophomores, which was probably good for the

11:16.803 --> 11:18.204
but it took up a lot of time. It was a tremendous 
amount of extracurricular time spent on working

11:19.746 --> 11:25.551
on equipment.

11:30.456 --> 11:44.869
This was, I suppose in one respect, I made the 
mistake of getting so interested in research that

11:30.456 --> 11:44.869
I didn't do very well with my classwork, which I'm 
not sure in retrospect whether this was good or

11:30.456 --> 11:44.869
bad, but it's the way it was.

11:50.249 --> 12:04.362
The principal thing we worked on at Lehigh that I 
worked on with Ewing was the geophysical

11:50.249 --> 12:04.362
measurement of trying to see how deep the 
sediments were. It was basically how much mud is

12:04.382 --> 12:08.466
there on the bottom of the ocean. And it turned out, 
years later, we found out there was surprisingly

12:10.788 --> 12:19.817
little mud.

12:21.164 --> 12:35.242
That was one of the important, turned out to be one 
of the important clues on plate tectonics, that

12:21.164 --> 12:35.242
why weren't there more sediments in the ocean, and 
particularly near the center of the ocean. But

12:35.803 --> 12:40.609
anyhow, back at that time, it was trying to get some 
apparatus going.

12:44.134 --> 12:48.640
We both practiced and tried to get data by doing 
seismic work along the continental shelf from the

12:48.957 --> 12:56.384
outcrops in the Appalachians out to the edge of the 
ocean. A strong coworker there was John Lamar

12:58.345 --> 13:08.575
Warzel, who was an undergraduate at the same time I 
was a graduate student. He was one of several very

13:09.936 --> 13:18.964
smart, very hardworking, very cantankerous 
students that ended up with versatility and

13:19.315 --> 13:27.025
toughness to keep going at the system.

13:30.890 --> 13:40.263
We built nearly all of our own apparatus in deep 
water work.

13:40.623 --> 13:45.269
Excuse me, I want to go back to the work on land. For 
about A year and a half, or over about a two-year

13:48.897 --> 14:09.098
period, we intermittently did this shore work 
with about five lines of stations from the

13:48.897 --> 14:09.098
outcrops down to the beach, mostly across the 
state of New Jersey, although some in New England.

14:12.741 --> 14:18.347
One had to learn a certain amount of politics 
because you tended to drill your shot holes at the

14:18.749 --> 14:19.951
edge of the highway. So if the highwayman came 
along, you said you thought you were on the man's

14:20.091 --> 14:26.260
property. And if a farmer came along, you said you 
thought you were on the highway. And then after the

14:29.706 --> 14:38.900
dynamite blew up, why, then you folded your tent 
and left as quickly as you could. But there was a

14:38.920 --> 14:44.368
great deal of work with explosives at that time. 
and this was transformed soon into work at sea. But

14:49.859 --> 15:06.356
in this work on land, one interesting aspect of it 
was we'd go out for extremely long weekends, and on

14:49.859 --> 15:06.356
Sunday night when we came back, we would, when 
possible, try and stop off at Princeton and see

14:49.859 --> 15:06.356
Richard Field, who was interested in how things 
were going.

15:09.139 --> 15:11.622
I want to emphasize again what a What a great 
influence he had, certainly on people like Morris

15:12.192 --> 15:21.162
Ewing and also on junior people such as myself.

15:26.188 --> 15:39.904
Along about 1937, Ewing

15:26.188 --> 15:39.904
got a grant from the Geological Society of America 
to do deepwater geophysical work at sea. This work

15:46.195 --> 15:51.560
was going to be done in cooperation with the Woods 
Hole Oceanographic Institution and their ship

15:46.195 --> 15:51.560
Atlantis.

15:54.402 --> 16:09.435
For the next three years, we had about 10 days or two 
weeks, the tail end of each summer, to utilize the

15:54.402 --> 16:09.435
ship in conjunction with other people to test out 
our apparatus and get some measurements.

16:11.778 --> 16:25.130
I will outline the approach a little bit because I 
think that is an important part, has played an

16:11.778 --> 16:25.130
important part in certainly the way I've looked at 
oceanography and equipment.

16:26.571 --> 16:30.755
The first way was to copy pretty much what they were 
doing at sea. We got a piece of an old cannon barrel

16:30.835 --> 16:36.320
for an instrument case. We had a string of four 
geophones and three bombs We built all the

16:42.878 --> 16:47.165
apparatus that went into them, including the 
geophones. I took them to sea and used them for two

16:49.428 --> 16:53.054
summers. Amongst other things,

16:55.197 --> 17:08.178
the first year we did not know whether explosives 
would go off on the bottom of the ocean. DuPont had

17:10.503 --> 17:14.887
suggested they might not, so we built pressure 
cases for them. The second year, we tried TNT and

17:16.609 --> 17:37.388
making TNT, we took granulated TNT, sent it down to 
the bottom in rubber bags so it would compress,

17:16.609 --> 17:37.388
then we drilled a hole in it for the blasting caps, 
and the next day we would put our blasting caps in it

17:38.093 --> 17:50.850
and put it back and tighten up the rubber balloons 
and use our TNT exposed to full sea pressure. It

17:53.053 --> 17:55.195
seemed to function all right. However, the 
general problem of laying out a piece of apparatus

17:56.737 --> 18:03.426
nearly a mile long, half a mile long on the bottom of 
the ocean, And keeping it oriented and then

18:04.975 --> 18:18.494
keeping this sensitive apparatus so that it 
wasn't jerked on by this half-inch steel cable

18:04.975 --> 18:18.494
that supported it all was a little much, and we knew 
it.

18:21.859 --> 18:32.974
I think one of the more interesting days of my life 
was one Sunday night after reading the New York

18:21.859 --> 18:32.974
Times about... Jacques, about Auguste Picard's 
bathyscaphe, where they used gasoline to float

18:33.410 --> 18:48.273
the bathyscaphe up and down, we came to the 
conclusion that perhaps this was the way to lower

18:33.410 --> 18:48.273
our apparatus to the bottom. And in fact, we wrote 
up a paper on this and proposed this as deep sea

18:48.293 --> 18:57.207
instruments without wires or cables.

18:58.300 --> 19:19.167
One Sunday night, we thought about this very 
seriously, in fact, so seriously that we decided

18:58.300 --> 19:19.167
to junk a two-year-old program that had a 
fantastic amount of work already into it on the

18:58.300 --> 19:19.167
grounds that it just couldn't stand up to a free 
instrument system. So we started building

19:21.090 --> 19:25.135
apparatus

19:25.790 --> 19:34.461
where each recorder, each bomb was completely 
separate with its own time clock, which was

19:25.790 --> 19:34.461
furnished by the Hamlin Watch Company.

19:39.687 --> 19:50.661
Several points about this kind of work, which I 
believe were important to the future of

19:39.687 --> 19:50.661
individuals involved in oceanography. One, it 
was starting at the bottom of the ocean. I'd been in

19:54.697 --> 20:07.015
oceanography for three years before I had much of 
anything to do with any equipment or ideas and so

19:54.697 --> 20:07.015
forth, which were meant to be used at water depths 
shallower than two miles. And as a result, you got

20:08.858 --> 20:20.856
thinking of the bottom of the ocean with the 
standard depth, and all other depths were less

20:08.858 --> 20:20.856
than standard.

20:21.646 --> 20:34.306
drove one rather early to think much more about 
pressurized, about pressure vessels and also

20:21.646 --> 20:34.306
techniques in which you do not need to put things in 
pressure vessels. When we first needed batteries

20:35.928 --> 20:49.830
to run the light through a deep sea camera,

20:35.928 --> 20:49.830
just the thought of putting ordinary dry cell 
batteries into a container bothered us both from

20:50.384 --> 20:58.215
the standpoint of cost and also from the 
standpoint of weight. So we couldn't see any

21:00.799 --> 21:11.575
reason why chemically a storage battery 
shouldn't work as well exposed to sea pressure as

21:00.799 --> 21:11.575
not. By this time, we had a 14-inch shell, which 
we'd gotten from the Army and installed.

21:21.620 --> 21:32.475
And this could be operated at pressures up to 
12,000 to 15,000 PSI, or about 10,000 PSI, which we

21:21.620 --> 21:32.475
did. Nearly all that work was done at night because 
it was so close to the breaking point of the shell.

21:37.943 --> 21:42.529
And it was installed just below the office of the 
chairman of the department. And we thought if

21:42.910 --> 21:45.433
there was going to be an accident, it better be at 
night.

21:49.413 --> 22:08.268
It turned out, of course, that not only was the 
storage battery happy working at pressure, but it

21:49.413 --> 22:08.268
actually seemed to, if anything, prefer the 
temperatures and pressures at the bottom of the

21:49.413 --> 22:08.268
ocean over being jostled around in your 
automobile. This technique was in one way or

22:12.751 --> 22:15.314
another, was used in a variety of other ways. I 
think the important thing here is that we, very

22:16.195 --> 22:30.073
early on,

22:16.195 --> 22:30.073
we maintained respect, but we lost any particular 
fear for pressures in the bottom of the ocean.

22:30.233 --> 22:41.007
Because as Percy Bridgman said in his book on high 
pressures, that his book was not about pressures

22:30.233 --> 22:41.007
like 10,000 psi. His book was about high 
pressures. And this is important because

22:44.307 --> 22:58.646
altogether too many people still do think of the 
pressures in the bottom of the ocean as being high

22:44.307 --> 22:58.646
when actually they're low compared to the 
strength of a wide range of commonly used

22:44.307 --> 22:58.646
materials. And I think the important thing about 
the bottom of the ocean is be careful but be

22:59.608 --> 23:05.876
optimistic.

23:11.383 --> 23:11.884
The... Seismic at sea work was continued rather 
falteringly. A tremendous amount of effort went

23:23.281 --> 23:34.734
into building the apparatus, and it didn't get 
very much usage, but it got a few numbers during the

23:23.281 --> 23:34.734
next four years.

23:37.957 --> 23:42.242
Lately, Ted Bullard, in describing some of this 
work, said that he was amazed that Ewing was

23:43.083 --> 23:51.255
willing to draw so many conclusions from so little 
data. But he realized that A, that was all the data

23:52.116 --> 23:58.225
we had, and B, that was Ewing.

24:02.692 --> 24:08.500
Incidentally, Ted Bullard did come over and go out 
to see on some of the measurements. Another

24:09.830 --> 24:19.244
important part in this era was the development of 
underwater cameras, which we did a little bit.

24:20.847 --> 24:32.384
First was done up in the Gulf of Maine with a camera 
we put together over a weekend because it seemed so

24:20.847 --> 24:32.384
ridiculous to go to sea and not take pictures. We 
bought a $12 Argus, a used a pressure case that was

24:35.885 --> 24:42.153
made out of a test tube we had that was three feet 
long and about six inches in diameter. And while

24:43.675 --> 25:00.137
this was able to float by itself,

24:43.675 --> 25:00.137
we fastened a piece of string or what the fishermen 
called cod line to it so we could operate it at night

24:43.675 --> 25:00.137
and not lose it. When you don't have much money, you 
have to be much more fundamental.

25:08.739 --> 25:21.737
So that we didn't lose this thing, we had a ground 
rule that no one on the camera could wear any gloves

25:08.739 --> 25:21.737
because the string wasn't terribly strong, but it 
was very fine, and you would cut your hands before

25:08.739 --> 25:21.737
you could break the string. This camera... It was 
very successful. And during the several months we

25:30.047 --> 25:46.322
had it, it took a great many pictures and was 
really, I think, the forerunner of cameras that

25:30.047 --> 25:46.322
were to be used at deeper than diver depths. And it 
showed that it was really nothing very difficult

25:47.583 --> 25:51.427
about it. And as we emphasized in the paper, Ewing 
and Warzel and I wrote. It was not a question of

25:58.084 --> 25:59.566
optics. It was a question of mechanics, of 
arranging your equipment so that there would be

25:59.726 --> 26:18.286
something in front of the camera when you took the 
picture, and then also in not violating the simple

25:59.726 --> 26:18.286
elementary rules of backlighting and so forth. 
The National Geographic then sponsored us for

26:25.420 --> 26:38.976
more comprehensive photographic program which 
we made a camera to operate on the bottom of the

26:25.420 --> 26:38.976
ocean out to depths of three miles. This camera was 
one of the first pieces of equipment we lowered

26:41.258 --> 26:48.146
without any wires or cables. And if I might just 
tell a sea story There, many years later, I was

26:54.985 --> 27:03.338
honored by the Compass Award of the Marine 
Technology Society. And when given the award,

27:03.438 --> 27:23.288
normally one says as little as possible, but I made 
a comment that when the man was outlining all of the

27:03.438 --> 27:23.288
splendid things I was supposed to have done, that 
all I could think of was when we took our deep sea

27:03.438 --> 27:23.288
camera out for the first time. And in that clear, 
azure water off Bermuda, we lowered it over the

27:24.432 --> 27:31.326
side and cast it free. And when it was about 10 feet 
underwater, I remembered I had left the lens cap

27:32.027 --> 27:38.200
on. And nothing could have been further from your 
mind that you would ever be given any kind of an

27:38.220 --> 27:45.394
award for anything other than nautical 
ignorance.
