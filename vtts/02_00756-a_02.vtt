00:06.697 --> 00:24.132
Another area of research that has been done here 
and reported in several places, including one of

00:06.697 --> 00:24.132
the held in Brazil, and two years ago, almost two 
years ago, at the first Latin American Polity

00:24.112 --> 00:43.995
Congress, which was held in Mexico City, this 
subject was reported. But it is a very popular area

00:44.696 --> 00:49.562
of concern among institutional as well as 
industry people at the present time, and that is

00:49.542 --> 01:03.466
the so-called recycling of poultry wastes. And we 
did some work on this, actually recycling it to In

01:13.218 --> 01:37.676
the poultry, the most common usage of the 
recycling of the nutrients and the actual feed

01:13.218 --> 01:37.676
wastage from the troughs and also the undigested 
material going through the birds, you see, plus

01:13.218 --> 01:37.676
what little they can get from the litter that they 
use for growing the birds. They call this... DPW,

01:40.758 --> 01:50.813
dried poultry waste, and it has been used rather 
extensively for feeding of cattle. It is still

01:52.075 --> 02:02.631
frowned upon, its use is still frowned upon by the 
FDA because they are afraid of a

02:03.674 --> 02:13.906
additives that may still be in the material and 
thus pick it up as residues in the tissues. But the

02:14.807 --> 02:29.344
people, the industry people, are very careful 
about this and they normally do not use it if

02:14.807 --> 02:29.344
there's any possibility of contamination of the 
tissues of animals. But in 1969, we published,

02:29.628 --> 02:44.430
that's five years ago, we published an article 
which covered two years of work with laying hens

02:29.628 --> 02:44.430
where we recycled this. litter from three 
different sources, from the broilers and from

02:44.613 --> 02:59.609
laying hens and from pullets that had been raised 
to laying age. And these three sources of the DPW,

02:59.629 --> 03:12.983
or dried poultry waste, and we used this and used it 
at 10 and 20 percent levels and got very good

02:59.629 --> 03:12.983
results. It can be reused. In other words, we only 
reused it one time, but it probably could be

03:14.825 --> 03:26.900
recycled again and again, particularly if it's 
used with cattle, I'm quite sure, that can be

03:14.825 --> 03:26.900
reused. And so we think we were fairly early in our 
interest in this area and actually did some

03:27.440 --> 03:35.730
experimental work in this area.

03:42.477 --> 03:50.631
I've noted that a large percentage of the work that 
you have done on chickens has been with laying

03:42.477 --> 03:50.631
hens. How did you come to settle upon laying hens as 
opposed to broilers or some other aspect? Well,

03:57.482 --> 04:06.654
that's a very good question, and it has perhaps a 
surprising answer, but not necessarily so. You

04:07.615 --> 04:18.188
will recall that when I entered the poultry 
department at Texas A&M University, I entered it

04:07.615 --> 04:18.188
as head of the department in an administrative 
position. And so we were affected in the same way

04:18.168 --> 04:28.017
that almost all institutions are. You never have 
enough financial support to do all of the things

04:28.478 --> 04:35.284
that you and your staff want to do. So you have to 
sort of set up priorities and use your funds in this

04:35.965 --> 04:42.291
fashion. Well, this being true, you see, that 
there is... rarely, if ever, enough funds to do all

04:47.716 --> 04:54.233
the things that a scientific staff wants to do. It 
was quite important, being head of the

04:55.356 --> 05:03.717
department, that I try to set up a research program 
were there would be no opportunity for staff to

05:03.697 --> 05:20.616
feel that the department head was using his 
authority to take funds ahead of somebody else who

05:03.697 --> 05:20.616
needed them, you see. And when I first started this 
program, At the laying hens, my research with

05:25.988 --> 05:41.549
laying hens has majorly been designed in the 
applied or practical kind of areas rather than in

05:25.988 --> 05:41.549
the highly basic or scientific areas. And this is 
also purposely set up because At the time the

05:46.475 --> 06:08.803
program started, the income from the sale of 
surplus eggs from the experiments was that the

05:46.475 --> 06:08.803
price of eggs was generally high enough to pay for 
the feed, the labor, and so that actually the

05:46.475 --> 06:08.803
research program of the laying hens was 
self-supporting. And therefore, I could use the

06:09.340 --> 06:27.320
sales returns from the research program and feel 
free of not being misunderstood in terms of

06:09.340 --> 06:27.320
priorities, administrative priorities, for the 
research program. And so that is the reason why

06:27.861 --> 06:33.087
this was picked. In the case of broilers, if the 
price of broilers was high at the time you marketed

06:33.067 --> 06:41.020
your birds, then you probably got some returns. 
But if, on the other hand, it was low, you might have

06:41.521 --> 06:45.888
lost some money. But at that time, laying hands, 
now it happens that actually the price of eggs in

06:46.228 --> 06:57.066
the meantime have changed so that currently you'd 
be subject to the same danger. that you would

06:57.046 --> 06:58.608
withdraw this. But in those days, it was not so, and 
this determined two things. That I would pick

07:04.113 --> 07:24.353
laying hens for my experimental program, and that 
I'd pick the productive, applied efficiency

07:04.113 --> 07:24.353
areas, management and so on, those areas of 
research, rather than the costly, basic type of

07:04.113 --> 07:24.353
research. That way you would leave the funds 
appropriated by the state for the other members of

07:24.788 --> 07:30.838
the department. Yes, yes. And I was very careful 
for them to see the budgets as the appropriations

07:31.580 --> 07:43.320
were made each year, and also for them to see what 
they had available for their programs. And I

07:43.300 --> 07:47.767
think, as far as I know, I did not have complaints. I 
might not have ever heard them, if there's been

07:47.887 --> 07:50.551
any. But I was real proud of the fact that I 
overheard little and no complaints because of

07:51.112 --> 07:58.903
this. And it was done purposely for this reason. 
You mentioned just a minute ago about for a long

08:02.437 --> 08:12.371
time eggs were kind of a steady cash crop, but now 
the price tends to fluctuate more than it did in the

08:02.437 --> 08:12.371
past. Yes, and not only that, but the margins, the 
egg production units have become so large. There

08:19.921 --> 08:26.250
used to be a fairly large margin between the cost of 
production and the sale price of the eggs. But now,

08:26.230 --> 08:39.229
because the units have gotten so big—now, I don't 
know which is cause and which is—well, I do, too,

08:26.230 --> 08:39.229
but it could be rationalized which is cause and 
which is effect. But the units are so large today

08:39.249 --> 08:51.107
that they have to be that way because the margins 
have gotten so narrow between the actual

08:39.249 --> 08:51.107
production cost price cost and the sale price of 
the eggs. And for that reason, there isn't much

08:58.323 --> 09:03.574
margin left there. And so you're very close to the 
same kind of a fluctuating pattern that we have in

09:03.975 --> 09:10.750
broilers.

09:13.970 --> 09:21.047
During your tenure as head of the department, how 
were your research projects chosen? Did you see a

09:21.087 --> 09:31.152
problem and try to solve it, or did you have an 
interest and follow the interest? Well, of course

09:31.621 --> 09:40.172
it was a combination of both because none of us like 
to do work that we don't like ourselves. But here I

09:40.953 --> 09:54.289
mentioned when we first started this area of 
discussion, I mentioned that here might be an area

09:40.953 --> 09:54.289
where an individual could boast a little bit. 
Well, here's what I did. I have religiously and

09:59.195 --> 10:25.995
many times, partly if not wholly at my own expense, 
I have attended national and international

09:59.195 --> 10:25.995
meetings to keep up with what the problems were in 
this country domestically, in the various

09:59.195 --> 10:25.995
states, and in the various countries of the world, 
what problems were bothering the and troubling

10:25.975 --> 10:41.892
the production group and so i was able by this 
method to keep up with these and in a few cases i hope

10:25.975 --> 10:41.892
that intuitively i anticipated what was coming 
next And so for this reason, we tried to get the

10:41.872 --> 10:51.165
answers at least by the time they were needed, and 
in a few cases, ahead of that. I think in one

10:52.767 --> 11:01.318
particular case, in the matter of phase fading, we 
had some answers before industry was ready to

10:52.767 --> 11:01.318
adopt it. And as a result, it didn't get much 
attention for quite a long while.

11:11.272 --> 11:11.372
Okay. I noted that in the past you had had several 
occasions on which you had a foreign assignment.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.504
Could you talk about those for a little bit? Yes, I 
was very fortunate in

11:27.325 --> 11:41.983
making some of the foreign meetings, as I said, 
part of them at my own expense and part of them at the

11:27.325 --> 11:41.983
invitation of the particular governments that 
were involved, and the major source of funds for

11:41.963 --> 12:01.764
the foreign trips was AID assignments, and so I 
participated always on a short-term basis,

11:41.963 --> 12:01.764
because I could not afford to be gone very long. But 
these have always been quite attractive to me, I

12:07.850 --> 12:09.192
like to travel. I love to meet and get to know people 
in other countries and to see their problems as

12:09.352 --> 12:17.766
well as our own. And back to our research program, 
here's another one that we might have anticipated

12:18.607 --> 12:30.887
a little bit because when I came back from hawaii 
most of the birds in hawaii this was not

12:30.867 --> 12:45.383
necessarily intuitive but purely an observation 
that in hawaii most of the birds were housed laying

12:30.867 --> 12:45.383
birds were housed in cages And almost no birds in 
Texas at that time were housed in cages. There were

12:50.392 --> 12:53.116
quite a few in California, but none in Texas. So we 
initiated, immediately initiated, a

12:53.897 --> 13:06.575
cage-laying experiment and started getting 
together data on the feeding of cage-layers and

12:53.897 --> 13:06.575
the management of cage-layers. And so now almost 
100% of the birds in some of the states are housed in

13:06.595 --> 13:15.167
cages, and a very high percentage of the lame birds 
in Texas are now housed in cages as well. But at

13:20.833 --> 13:41.897
first, some of those early reports were not always 
accepted as friendlily as I would like for them to

13:20.833 --> 13:41.897
have been, but they were, and so for that reason, we 
believe that THIS ENTERED IN TO THE

13:48.830 --> 13:53.876
availability for some of the foreign 
assignments. By caged layers, you mean is each

13:55.017 --> 14:00.203
chicken in an individual cage? At first they 
majorly were housed this way, but very quickly

14:00.223 --> 14:12.236
they, and a lot of the work was done here that showed 
that it could be done otherwise. The cost of

14:13.297 --> 14:16.761
building a cage for one bird is fairly high. So what 
they did, they started putting what we call higher

14:19.605 --> 14:24.513
density. In other words, we put two birds per cage, 
three birds per cage. In a few cases, the cages

14:28.359 --> 14:33.287
would be a little bigger in size. But the density, 
the square footage of the cage area allowed per

14:33.307 --> 14:42.040
bird was reduced as we added more birds. And so the 
common practice now is to house from three to five

14:42.020 --> 14:49.752
birds per cage per unit. And you get more eggs at 
less cost in this method than by letting the birds

14:51.082 --> 14:57.109
run free? If they're properly managed. They have 
to be de-beaked, keep them picking each other.

15:02.014 --> 15:03.977
They have to be properly fed. And the diets have 
been increased in density because there is more

15:04.437 --> 15:10.384
competition between birds. There's both social 
competition between birds, and there's also

15:10.724 --> 15:18.473
mechanical competition for water and feeder 
space. And so if they're properly managed, and all

15:18.453 --> 15:36.416
of this had to be investigated experimentally in 
order to supply industry with some of the answers

15:18.453 --> 15:36.416
to some of the questions and solutions to some of 
the problems they had in doing this. And

15:37.657 --> 15:48.291
generally, there's been the initiation of the 
POTI programs in many of the foreign countries

15:37.657 --> 15:48.291
because of the... availability of labor. See, 
labor's been cheap in most of the developing

15:51.788 --> 15:55.894
countries. And the cage operation at first, at 
least, it's become so mechanized now that it may

15:56.535 --> 16:03.705
not any longer be true in this country. But the 
labor required for cage operation was a little

16:04.326 --> 16:11.577
higher than the litter floor kind of operation. 
And so it just it became natural to recommend cage

16:13.820 --> 16:20.789
operations in these foreign countries. And this 
led to, as you went from one to another, this led to

16:21.310 --> 16:28.960
assignments in the various countries.

16:33.887 --> 16:40.215
But in view of the fact that you were head of the very 
active department here on campus, it was not

16:40.786 --> 16:45.217
possible for you to really take a long-term 
assignment. Right. The longest assignment that I

16:45.739 --> 16:48.827
ever took was six weeks. And these were usually 
taken in the middle of a semester. rarely, I don't

16:57.526 --> 17:03.872
believe ever, at budget-making time or at the 
beginning of the semesters. It was usually, they

17:03.972 --> 17:07.096
were flexible. These assignments were flexible, 
and they usually were taken when the time could be

17:07.196 --> 17:13.642
spared. And we had some very excellent people on 
the staff who assumed responsibility for the

17:13.682 --> 17:22.891
mechanical work of the department head while I was 
gone. Now that you've reached retirement age and I

17:27.766 --> 17:35.451
believe you told me earlier that you had finished 
with all of the students who were working under you

17:27.766 --> 17:35.451
at the time of your retirement. Do you look forward 
to perhaps a longer stint abroad someplace in the

17:35.472 --> 17:39.565
future? No, I just don't like to be gone. I want to 
keep up with the United States, with my friends and

17:44.135 --> 17:53.212
the industry and the progress of the industry in 
the United States. And so I have limited my

17:53.814 --> 18:01.789
assignments, longer than the six weeks, but I've 
limited my assignments to three. Perhaps I might

18:01.769 --> 18:06.875
be able to take three and a half or four months, but 
I've limited to that. If an assignment is longer

18:06.895 --> 18:18.049
than this, I think it would be no problem to get a 
two-year assignment, but I will not accept a

18:06.895 --> 18:18.049
two-year assignment anywhere. The maximum was 
the one that I've had so far is the one I had this

18:19.251 --> 18:25.819
year. early this year, the latter part of last 
year, December, January, and February, the three

18:25.799 --> 18:32.333
months in Pakistan. And there may be some others. I 
can take up to three months now, but I do not plan to

18:34.257 --> 18:41.452
take much longer than this length of assignment. 
Again, it takes you too far away from your contacts

18:41.853 --> 18:45.260
locally. Yes, yes. My ideas

18:45.982 --> 18:58.116
are so small and so few that it doesn't take me much 
more than three months to get a whole express

18:45.982 --> 18:58.116
worked out. So for that reason, the longer 
assignments, you actually may be getting into the

18:58.136 --> 19:13.214
mechanics rather than to idea development. Well, 
it's the type of thing you do. I take it as more

19:16.441 --> 19:23.174
giving of advice rather than going in and setting 
up a totally new program. Yeah, generally this is

19:23.555 --> 19:25.478
true, yes. It's really, they are, I think all of the 
assignments I've had could very well be called

19:26.620 --> 19:35.918
consultantships. Now, there were AIDA 
consultantships. There were, in some cases,

19:39.406 --> 19:44.298
private industry consultantships. I've been 
invited to go to some of the countries by private

19:44.358 --> 19:50.152
industry for consultation. And in other cases, 
it's been... for the government itself in these

19:53.650 --> 20:21.227
countries, consultant with the government 
officials as to how to design the program, whether

19:53.650 --> 20:21.227
they should try to breed their own birds, or 
whether they should import the breeding stock

19:53.650 --> 20:21.227
from other countries and establish a franchise 
kind of a breeding program, and this type of

19:53.650 --> 20:21.227
information is major. The last assignment I spoke 
of in Pakistan was an FAO, United Nations

20:21.207 --> 20:29.057
assignment. That was my first United Nations 
assignment, incidentally. But the type of

20:33.122 --> 20:48.582
assignment that you have been accepting can be 
handled in the short term, whereas if you were to go

20:33.122 --> 20:48.582
into a developing country that had not had a 
poultry science department and they wanted to

20:33.122 --> 20:48.582
establish one, And they chose you to do that. 
That's the kind that would take a long time. Yes,

20:52.585 --> 20:54.108
that would take a long time. And I have not desired 
and have not accepted responsibility for that

20:54.209 --> 21:06.857
type of an assignment.

21:10.313 --> 21:15.443
Are you continuing to carry on individual 
research at the current time? Yes, on a bit of a

21:16.345 --> 21:20.393
limited basis. A great deal of my research program 
was carried on by the graduate students.

21:32.858 --> 21:51.745
finishing up of the graduate students, well then 
this means that I either have to have a technician

21:32.858 --> 21:51.745
kind of help or I have to depend upon personally 
doing the work myself and the labor that is not

21:52.214 --> 22:10.729
trained in this area and has no particular concern 
about the specific requirements of a research

21:52.214 --> 22:10.729
program, and for that reason the experiments of 
that sort I'm not willing to design the

22:10.709 --> 22:20.003
experiments and have to throw the data away when I 
get it accumulated. If you decide you're going to

22:20.323 --> 22:26.512
feed a chicken a certain number of grams of the kind 
of food per day, it has to be exactly that many. A few

22:28.255 --> 22:37.408
too many would not matter so much to someone who is 
not working on a degree in that area. But if a

22:37.388 --> 22:43.841
student is working on a degree, then he's going to 
be very careful if he doesn't write. I've had some

22:44.202 --> 22:52.519
very fine graduate students in the past, and it's 
been a real pleasure to work with them. They've

22:52.539 --> 22:54.182
been quite exacting. and quite careful in their 
program of work. And it's naturally mutual

22:57.789 --> 23:15.242
because they, most of them, have been 
establishing a learning and establishing a

22:57.789 --> 23:15.242
program of activity to be continued post 
graduation for them and so naturally they want to

23:15.222 --> 23:16.904
to do a good job. And so as a result, it's been 
dependable. I could depend upon it myself, and the

23:21.750 --> 23:38.149
material could be published or used, distributed 
to industry with a confidence that otherwise

23:21.750 --> 23:38.149
might not be there.

23:38.169 --> 23:45.077
I believe you have received a number of honors or 
awards during your tenure here, are any of those

23:45.344 --> 23:57.926
that particularly stand out in your mind as those 
which, in a sense, you might have appreciated the

23:45.344 --> 23:57.926
most of all? Well, it's been my privilege to serve 
and

24:07.349 --> 24:15.489
capacities within the organization, the honor 
societies and the technical organizations to

24:07.349 --> 24:15.489
which I belonged. And this has always been a real 
challenge and a real reward when it's finished in

24:16.551 --> 24:24.210
that regard. But there are certain awards that I 
have received and for which I'm very grateful and

24:24.190 --> 24:36.136
which have been a source of encouragement to me. 
Perhaps just to mention a few of those, one would be

24:37.118 --> 24:43.532
the...

24:45.149 --> 24:53.962
the research, the former students distinguished 
faculty achievement award. And mine was in the

24:54.562 --> 24:58.448
area of research. And I very much appreciated 
this. And it's been a real challenge, a real

25:01.953 --> 25:08.963
encouragement for further achievement. And then 
from industry, that would be from the university,

25:08.943 --> 25:18.194
from the industry there are two things that stand 
out in my mind. One is that the American Poultry and

25:18.995 --> 25:29.668
Hatchery Federation, which has now been merged 
with the Institute of American Poultry

25:18.995 --> 25:29.668
Industries, asked me to serve as their research 
director and they had about fifteen to twenty

25:29.648 --> 25:40.907
thousand dollars a year that they wanted to put in 
institutional research programs. And so it is my

25:42.234 --> 26:10.928
business to accumulate research projects from 
the Pony scientists in the various land grant,

25:42.234 --> 26:10.928
mostly land grant, but there were other types of 
institutions, assemble those during the year,

25:42.234 --> 26:10.928
digest them, and then turn them over to the 
research committee, three of these industry

25:42.234 --> 26:10.928
members, and they pick then the particular 
projects that were to be supported for the

25:42.234 --> 26:10.928
following year, and then a small grant. The grants 
were purposely small because they wanted to

26:10.908 --> 26:19.085
distribute them widely to encourage research in 
the areas in which they were having problems. And

26:19.566 --> 26:25.217
you asked a moment ago about how we figured out 
these problems. Well, this helped. I served for

26:26.500 --> 26:28.043
about nine years. They called it the research 
director of APHL. And I have a plaque

26:32.963 --> 26:41.979
commemorating this service, but it was a very 
delightful kind of experience. And then the other

26:41.999 --> 26:55.382
was the receipt of the second Golden Feather 
Award, which was made by our Texas Poetry

26:41.999 --> 26:55.382
Federation in the state. This was made in 1969. And 
it's right there behind you. And I'm very

27:00.702 --> 27:03.046
extremely proud of that. Another one of our 
faculty members, Mr. Ben Warmly, who is retired,

27:03.086 --> 27:17.828
received the seventh one just about three weeks 
ago at Dallas at the Texas Polar Federation

27:03.086 --> 27:17.828
meeting. They give only one of those per year. One 
per year, right.

27:24.478 --> 27:27.102
So it must be rather a high honor to receive 
something of that nature. Well, naturally, those

27:29.698 --> 27:32.704
of us who received it consider it so. We could be 
prejudiced. I would be. Well, I think anytime when

27:36.931 --> 27:48.212
you're the only one in the entire state of Texas, 
and I imagine the Poultry Federation is a sizable

27:36.931 --> 27:48.212
group. It represents all of the commodity areas. 
There's five different sections within it. There

27:56.356 --> 28:08.392
is the hatchery group, there is the broiler group, 
there's the egg group, there is the Allied Poultry

27:56.356 --> 28:08.392
Association, all of those who sell vaccines, 
equipment, etc. That's the Allied Poultry Group.

28:11.362 --> 28:24.597
And then the egg production, egg producers, and I 
think that's the hatchery, the egg, the broiler,

28:11.362 --> 28:24.597
the turkey, yes, the Texas Turkey Federation 
group. So those are all part of the Mother Hubbard

28:24.617 --> 28:32.305
organization, which is called the Texas Poetry 
Federation. And the award is made by the

28:33.667 --> 28:38.432
federation, which represents all of those 
groups.

28:41.011 --> 28:43.123
Oh, gracious Jesus.
