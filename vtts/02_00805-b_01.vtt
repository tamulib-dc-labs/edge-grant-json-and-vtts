WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:05.949
So you had some students also from Arkansas. But 
second to Texas, the largest numbers came from

00:07.731 --> 00:12.456
Louisiana. Yeah, out-of-state students. And was 
there a difference between the quality of the

00:15.219 --> 00:19.323
out-of-state and the in-state students? Oh, no. 
The Louisiana boys were really good. Actually,

00:23.488 --> 00:26.151
Louisiana picked their own students, you see. 
They had to pay an out-of-state fee. And then that

00:29.334 --> 00:32.097
southern college

00:34.861 --> 00:46.155
Combine, whatever it was, anyway, the states 
without schools paid a certain amount for each

00:34.861 --> 00:46.155
out-of-state student accepted it. Texas A&M, so 
Louisiana boys were uniformly good. But then when

00:53.204 --> 01:00.413
they put in the two-year prerequisite, I mean, 
yeah, and Then the court system, where we got up to

01:02.435 --> 01:12.707
where we had three or four boys, or three or four 
people, I should say, applying for each place.

01:13.808 --> 01:17.573
That means when a boy does get accepted, he don't 
fool around. If you waited two or three years to get

01:17.633 --> 01:29.927
in school, you're not going to throw it away for one 
Saturday night beer bust.

01:30.447 --> 01:38.939
As far as the age of the students were concerned, 
you went to Kansas State at an older age than most of

01:30.447 --> 01:38.939
the students. Were most of the students here back 
in the 1940s young? Oh, yes. They were in their

01:45.528 --> 01:46.950
early 20s. Once in a while, you'd have one 19, but 
most of them were 21, 22, 23. And I don't know what

01:53.499 --> 01:59.627
percentage, but quite a few were people like 
county agents Agricultural people that decided

02:00.215 --> 02:04.760
they wanted to be veterinarians. Did you have any 
with former college? Oh yeah, quite a few. After

02:12.689 --> 02:28.467
the war in 1945, when the GI's came back, then when 
we really started to grow and when we really got

02:12.689 --> 02:28.467
uniformly good students, because we were went 
into a lot of jam sessions about these veterans

02:28.902 --> 02:34.250
coming back and they'd been used to being men. Of 
course, most of them, a lot of them were officers.

02:39.778 --> 02:46.908
And they'd give us a lot of baloney about how we had 
to treat them. Well, I never saw a better bunch of

02:48.150 --> 02:50.694
boys than those. They were polite and they'd say, 
sir, when you call the roll. And it wasn't

02:53.598 --> 02:57.103
difficult to, pick out who was flunk, it's 
difficult to pick out who you're gonna give the

02:58.096 --> 03:03.844
honors to. Dean Price out here graduated in 49, he 
was in the first class of the veterans. They came in

03:11.876 --> 03:18.606
in 45 and then on, and then on for about four or five 
years while the veterans predominated. And then I

03:20.168 --> 03:27.158
believe it was 1960, correct me on that if I'm 
wrong, and they opened it to the co-eds. Might have

03:27.661 --> 03:28.682
been later.

03:31.505 --> 03:36.251
But the girls were uniformed.

03:36.271 --> 03:51.829
It seems a rather interesting aspect of Texas A&M 
that these young men came back from the military,

03:36.271 --> 03:51.829
many of them having been officers, and then they 
became corpsmen. How did they respond to that? I

03:55.866 --> 03:56.387
don't know. You got me there. Doesn't that seem 
rather strange? Because the Corps itself seems to

04:02.173 --> 04:08.080
be a training ground to make officers. I don't 
know, but I know they were good students. I'd take a

04:14.167 --> 04:21.175
class of veterans any time over a bunch of kids just 
out of school. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. A great number of

04:23.585 --> 04:29.735
them were married and some of them had children and 
they were serious. Very serious I would imagine.

04:35.644 --> 04:48.023
Now back in 1888 the university named Dr. Mark 
Francis as associate professor of veterinarian

04:35.644 --> 04:48.023
sciences and the veterinarian for the experiment 
station And he remained at Texas A&M for almost a

04:48.982 --> 04:53.448
half a century. Did you have... June, June 1936, 
and I came here in February 1936. Right, so... I

05:00.877 --> 05:03.260
knew him five months. You knew him for five months. 
What were your, how did you meet him, do you

05:04.521 --> 05:07.725
remember? Well, he was actually acting head of the 
Department of Veterinary Science and acting

05:08.186 --> 05:13.993
dean, Ned Payton. Dr. Mark took over his active 
duties, and Dr. Smith took over him in the

05:14.682 --> 05:20.807
veterinary science. But he was an active old man. 
He came around and introduced himself to me the

05:23.029 --> 05:25.852
second day I was there. He said he hoped I liked it 
here. What were your first impressions? Oh, I

05:31.857 --> 05:33.719
loved him. He was about my size. In fact, he was near 
enough my size that I sat in for the photographer or

05:35.941 --> 05:43.407
the artist when they painted the pictures. for Dr. 
Francis.

05:51.081 --> 06:04.236
What do you think, although you only knew him for 
five months, did you have much of an opportunity to

05:51.081 --> 06:04.236
get to know him and could you comment about his 
character or just the type of personality he was?

06:04.496 --> 06:12.465
Oh he was, well you couldn't help but like him and he 
had a keen brain. He'd ask you searching

06:12.665 --> 06:14.547
questions. The trouble was he was almost totally 
deaf. Oh. And he had trouble communicating. For

06:22.816 --> 06:28.622
that reason, he talked a lot rather than letting 
you talk. Incidentally, you may wonder how I'm

06:28.642 --> 06:36.830
talking to you now, but I had a double ear operation 
in 1960. So I removed the interstates and I got rid

06:36.850 --> 06:41.575
of my hearing aids. Oh, good, good. Yeah, I was 
wondering that. That's great. So Dr. Francis was

06:49.097 --> 06:52.522
almost deaf, too. Was he deaf? Was this a... I don't 
know the clinical aspects of it. Oh, okay. That's

07:01.673 --> 07:03.475
what I was going to ask. That's what I was going

07:03.556 --> 07:08.342
to ask. Okay, clinical. But Dr. Francis 
single-handedly

07:13.415 --> 07:17.781
developed the immunization for Texas fever, 
rather pre-immunization. He single-handedly

07:17.821 --> 07:23.088
sold Texas on the fact they had to get rid of the 
tick. And he single-handedly started the School

07:24.249 --> 07:34.402
of Medicine, that old school over there now where 
the engineers had it. In the depth of depression in

07:35.444 --> 07:43.354
1932, he went over to the legislature and 
single-handedly got that appropriation. So

07:45.224 --> 07:53.234
Texas owes a wonderful debt to Dr. Francis. And 
yet, as far as I know, he never really antagonized

07:53.254 --> 07:58.540
anybody. He sold them on lodging. But he was a smart 
veterinarian. He was a highly intelligent man.

08:07.051 --> 08:09.894
That's a better way to put it. You said that there 
was something about him that was very likable.

08:14.280 --> 08:14.640
Why? Or what was it? Oh, I don't know. That little 
fly grin and his sense of humor. Mm-hmm. Good sense

08:21.134 --> 08:21.875
of humor. He had a wonderful sense of humor. 
Mm-hmm. I remember he was telling me about one time

08:24.759 --> 08:42.045
he come up there and he just found a little piece of 
paper where somebody back in Ohio or Minnesota or

08:24.759 --> 08:42.045
someplace had figured the world was formed 1,890 
years ago at 9 o'clock in the morning. He looked at

08:43.291 --> 08:45.394
me, he just giggled and said, 9 o'clock. Now I've 
been more like it. Walked

08:47.557 --> 08:51.183
off. You know, he was originally from Ohio and did 
his college at Ohio State. Did he ever say anything

09:01.978 --> 09:04.422
about? why he stayed for so long in Texas. I mean, 
after he began to establish this. Well, I think he

09:12.812 --> 09:15.015
took it as a challenge. And not only that, but the 
first faculty members of Texas A&M were from Ohio

09:16.097 --> 09:22.425
State. Dr. Mark Duller came in 1905, and Dr. Dunn 
came in 1911. D.W. Williams was an agriculture, an

09:27.931 --> 09:32.918
Ohio stater. And Penn versus Ohio State. In fact, 
for years, the curriculum of Texas A&M was almost

09:36.975 --> 09:48.367
identical to that of Ohio State.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.771
Is that because Ohio State was recognized as the 
leader? No, I think it's primarily because Dr.

09:52.372 --> 09:58.679
Dunn, Dr. Mark Taylor, and Dr. Francis were from 
Ohio State. Of course, you always think your old

09:59.380 --> 10:01.622
home state's the best. Sure, sure. Mm-hmm. What 
were the finest veterinary colleges in the

10:04.595 --> 10:11.926
country back at that time? Well, I couldn't be 
prejudiced. I'd say Kansas State, but actually

10:15.251 --> 10:23.523
Cornell and Ohio and Iowa probably were the three, 
the big three. Philadelphia was a private school.

10:26.928 --> 10:32.256
In other words, it wasn't state supported like 
Yale and Harvard and, you know,

10:36.269 --> 10:45.027
But Texas, see, graduated its first class in 1920, 
and those other schools had 20 years or so more than

10:36.269 --> 10:45.027
that. Dr. Francis graduated in 1888.

10:51.780 --> 10:56.590
So they had a lot longer to... Sure, to develop a 
program.

11:06.425 --> 11:16.378
There were a lot of other important people who were 
instrumental in the early years of the School of

11:06.425 --> 11:16.378
Veterinarians. And I'd like you to comment on some 
of these people, like Marsteller, Ross Perry

11:16.398 --> 11:22.206
Marsteller. Well, Dr. Marsteller was dedicated 
to making this, the Bascule in the United States.

11:34.657 --> 11:39.363
Dr. Marks had a way sometimes of rubbing people the 
wrong way. In his later years, he was not in very

11:40.264 --> 11:42.727
good health. And I think he antagonized people 
sometimes when he didn't mean to. Dr. Dunn was just

11:48.534 --> 11:55.082
as dedicated, but he was quiet and easygoing. And 
really, I think he did as much or more as any of them

11:55.582 --> 12:04.393
to keep a level of academic excellence. He was a 
scholar, really, too. And what about Marsdall?

12:11.970 --> 12:13.932
Was he a scholar? Well, I really didn't know him 
that well. I was busy keeping out of Dr. Schmidt's

12:19.099 --> 12:21.062
way. Yeah, let's talk about him. Let's talk about 
Herbert Schmidt for a while. Hubert, Hubert.

12:27.030 --> 12:27.991
Hubert, Hubert, yes. Could you tell me about him? 
Well, Darcy Smith was a big man. He was six foot plus

12:35.178 --> 12:41.525
and weighed around 200 pounds, 220.

12:44.028 --> 12:54.098
He graduated in animal husbandry from Texas A&M 
and was on the football team and played 60 minutes

12:44.028 --> 12:54.098
of every game. And he was a native. He was born to 
German immigrants near Comfort, Texas. And Dr.

13:02.761 --> 13:05.364
Francis took a liking to him. He asked him why he 
didn't go to Berlin, because at that time, before

13:06.765 --> 13:24.263
the war, Berlin, Germany, was topped on medicine 
and chemistry and a hell of a lot of other things. So

13:24.423 --> 13:31.350
with Dr. Francis urging, Smith went to Germany and 
took a degree in veterinary medicine over there.

13:36.153 --> 13:42.683
And he came back and Dr. Francis put him in charge of 
all research work for it. And veterinary science

13:42.703 --> 13:46.388
for the station. And Dr. Smith was methodical. And 
he had a brain, he was smart, there's no question

13:49.092 --> 13:52.397
about that. But he just had one fault. He didn't 
believe it unless he read it in German first. Due to

13:59.487 --> 14:01.270
his German background. The first thing he told me 
when I started working for him was I'd better learn

14:01.773 --> 14:06.319
to read German and I did. Really? Yeah, I read 
German. I never could pronounce it like he wanted

14:08.822 --> 14:16.632
me

14:08.822 --> 14:16.632
to. What type of administrator was he? Well, he 
wasn't too good because he was a perfectionist. A

14:25.503 --> 14:27.966
perfectionist is hard to work for. In other words, 
It's like I say, not like I do, you know. But I had no

14:34.000 --> 14:35.802
trouble with him. I worked for nine years. I left 
because... Another opportunity. Yeah.

14:47.118 --> 14:51.283
What about the type of administrators at Marsdell 
and Dunn were? Well, Dr. Marsdeller, maybe I

14:53.026 --> 14:58.493
shouldn't say this because he's dead, but He liked 
to keep everybody just a little afraid of him. He

15:04.257 --> 15:08.763
had a tendency to yell when a whisperer would have 
probably done better. Oh, I see. But he worked like

15:11.126 --> 15:14.911
the devil for the school. There was no doubt about 
that. He kept going through those years when we had

15:16.072 --> 15:19.777
no appropriations. He'd scrunch and knock around 
corners and whatnot to get the job done.

15:36.188 --> 15:37.510
And what about Dunn? Oh, Dunn, everybody loved 
him. He had no trouble in the department at all. In

15:43.698 --> 16:00.259
fact, I think they gave Dunn a dirty deal, and they 
made him dean, and then later they burned him out,

15:43.698 --> 16:00.259
and

15:43.698 --> 16:00.259
put Dunn back, and almost broke his heart. What 
happened there? I'm not aware of this episode.

16:06.125 --> 16:13.455
Well, when Dr. Marksteller died, they made Dr. 
Dean Dunn. And evidently the powers that be, I

16:15.458 --> 16:22.728
don't know the ins and outs of it, because I never 
was much for politics. I tried to stay out of their

16:22.748 --> 16:24.130
way. Why?

16:30.078 --> 16:34.444
They brought in Dr. Boughton from Sonora and made 
him Dean. returned Dr. Dunn to his department of

16:34.762 --> 17:04.498
bacteriology

16:34.762 --> 17:04.498
and it was a kind of a shock because he only had three 
or four more years to go but he never he would he was

16:34.762 --> 17:04.498
kind of reminded to get his feelings hurt

16:34.762 --> 17:04.498
and I guess I would have too sure and if he hadn't 
been old if he hadn't been As old as he was, he

17:05.390 --> 17:12.037
probably would have picked up and left, but nobody 
wants to hire a man sixty-two or three years old.

17:15.340 --> 17:18.003
How about Van Bauchenberg? Well, Van Bauchenberg 
was a Cornell graduate, and he came here from

17:19.365 --> 17:32.038
Puerto Rico, where he had been in charge of 
experimentation down there, and he was really a

17:19.365 --> 17:32.038
nice guy. but he had bad luck physically. Hi, how 
are you? This is Mr. Anderson, that's my wife. Glad

17:39.129 --> 17:39.850
to meet you. And so he came from Puerto Rico. To 
Texas. See, the Department of Veterinary Affairs

17:45.915 --> 17:49.999
dogs were just established that year. Before 
that, they'd all been lumped under Dr. Dunn.

17:57.526 --> 17:59.708
What kind of man was Van Bakken? Well, he was a A 
gentleman never meaning a word, that's the only

18:03.085 --> 18:05.789
thing I can say. He was quiet spoken, but he had 
trouble physically. He had a busted appendix and

18:10.476 --> 18:16.486
he was in the hospital for several months. And 
that's the time that I started teaching

18:16.506 --> 18:25.880
parastology, you know, filling in the gaps. And 
then he died suddenly of a heart attack. He never

18:28.945 --> 18:31.489
was, he never was strong physically after. But he 
was quite interested. He was a working member of

18:35.065 --> 18:45.561
the Baptist Church, secretary of the Rotary Club, 
and the boys liked him very well. But he was kind of

18:47.724 --> 18:49.427
like Dr. Dunn. He was soft-spoken. He didn't make 
much noise.

18:57.399 --> 19:00.784
I personally thought he was one of the best friends 
I had. He was, he was keen on Lexi. He was smart.

19:12.638 --> 19:14.481
Then his boy got killed in the war. He was a waist 
gunner on a bomber. That must have been a terrible

19:20.232 --> 19:24.419
shock. Sort of dropped him down more.

19:29.452 --> 19:32.175
So really, there's not too much to say about Van 
Volkenberg. He just did his job and didn't make any

19:32.215 --> 19:34.277
waves.

19:37.901 --> 19:51.376
OK, I think that

19:37.901 --> 19:51.376
we should continue and bring the story from the 
1940s up until you retired in the 1960s. But let's

19:51.496 --> 19:53.218
do that next time we talk. All right. All right? 
Fine. OK, this ends our interview then.

20:00.653 --> 20:05.841
This is an interview with Dr. RT Turk. Interview 
number two. Today's date is January 17, 1980. This

20:10.828 --> 20:13.392
is Terry Anderson.

20:25.950 --> 20:29.175
This is the second interview with Dr. Turk. on 
Thursday, January 17th, 1980. This is Terry

20:32.699 --> 20:34.061
Anderson. Let's start this by talking about the 
changes in curriculum. Well, to understand that,

20:39.469 --> 20:47.821
we'll have to have a little bit of history.

20:47.841 --> 20:54.531
When World War I broke out, the Army needed 
buttonheads.

20:57.035 --> 20:57.576
And they were rather disgruntled to find that many 
of the local, many of the practicing

20:59.412 --> 21:12.785
veterinarians were inadequately educated. The 
reason for that was that most of the veterinary

21:14.166 --> 21:18.250
schools were private schools. There were only 
about six or eight schools in the United States

21:19.091 --> 21:26.618
that offered the veterinary degree, but they were 
25 or 30 or possibly more private veterinary

21:27.779 --> 21:32.686
schools. Some of these had only the equivalent of 
college education, others only the equivalent of

21:32.706 --> 21:43.443
being able to read or write. Some of them had a 
six-month course and some of them had three years.

21:49.311 --> 21:55.120
Another thing that happened that no one was 
interested in veterinary education anymore

21:49.311 --> 21:55.120
because there weren't going to be any more horses. 
In 1914, Ford perfected his assembly line, and

21:56.230 --> 22:15.653
World War I came along, and planes and cars and so 
forth were the wave of the future. So the National

22:17.395 --> 22:24.043
Defense Act of 1920, among other things, 
stipulated the requirements for a veterinarian

22:25.930 --> 22:31.716
who would be eligible for government service. 
That included not only the Army, but also the

22:33.057 --> 22:44.790
United States Department of Agriculture with its 
meat inspectors and the quarantine service with

22:33.057 --> 22:44.790
its animal health inspectors. Very few of the, 
well actually none of the private veterinary

22:46.391 --> 22:52.798
schools could meet the requirements. So they 
closed one by one.

22:59.657 --> 23:01.819
Why couldn't they meet those requirements? Well, 
for the expense. They required English and

23:04.162 --> 23:14.293
history and bacteriology and pathology and many 
things besides purely clinical veterinary

23:04.162 --> 23:14.293
medicine. But nobody cared because there weren't 
going to be any use for veterinarians anymore

23:16.215 --> 23:23.022
anyway.

23:23.221 --> 23:33.113
In 1929, the first purely small animal hospital 
was established in Kansas City by a man named Dr.

23:23.221 --> 23:33.113
Flynn. How do you spell that? F-L-Y-N-N. Who could 
not do large animal practice because he had a

23:37.117 --> 23:43.905
wooden leg.

23:48.130 --> 23:49.752
In 1932,

23:51.520 --> 24:00.333
The demand for veterinarians were so slim that

23:51.520 --> 24:00.333
the University of Georgia closed their school 
down. And the veterinarians that were eligible to

24:00.373 --> 24:10.628
graduate came to Kansas State and various other 
colleges. They just deported them out. In 1929,

24:14.694 --> 24:17.798
Texas A&M graduated one student. Dr. W.T. Hardy in 
the House of Nora, Texas. In 1933, the year I

24:23.319 --> 24:34.013
graduated from Kansas State, Texas A&M only 
graduated four students. Dr. J.W. Dollahy was one

24:34.914 --> 24:36.256
of those.

24:39.580 --> 24:47.110
Then, along about 1938 or 1939,

24:39.580 --> 24:47.110
the public awakened to the fact that The average 
age of all veterinary in the United States was

24:47.495 --> 24:57.508
about 55 or 56 years old, and there would soon be an 
acute shortage.

25:01.253 --> 25:07.541
So the trend on veterinary medicine picked up. 
About that time, the boys on the East Coast,

25:09.203 --> 25:17.113
particularly from New York, found out they could 
go to Google Keeper in Texas Georgia and Alabama

25:17.920 --> 25:25.430
and even Colorado and Washington than they could 
in New York. So we had the influx of students. So in

25:30.356 --> 25:46.037
1939, they put in the requirement that students 
could come only from the state in which school was

25:30.356 --> 25:46.037
located or from adjoining states. Was that a state 
requirement or a Texas A&M requirement? It was a

25:50.454 --> 26:11.959
state requirement all across, all the colleges 
went in and joined because I think we had I believe

25:50.454 --> 26:11.959
79 students in 1939 of which purely 50% were from 
New York City. Really? 50% from New York City? They

26:16.118 --> 26:18.641
were from Upper New York.

26:21.325 --> 26:40.273
Even

26:21.325 --> 26:40.273
then, the pressure on veterinary faculty to take 
care of the students that applied mattered.

26:41.857 --> 26:48.547
they began to stiffen their requirement for 
entrance.

26:48.567 --> 26:54.475
I noticed in 1936 there was a new requirement 
established for entrance into the vet school. You

26:54.515 --> 26:58.701
had to have 15 hours of pre-professional college 
work. Now, what impact did that have on the student

26:58.721 --> 27:01.205
body? That had really much more limit than they 
anticipated. But it did. Limited the amount of

27:10.664 --> 27:13.668
students much more than they anticipated? Much 
less than they anticipated. Oh, much less than

27:15.110 --> 27:17.033
they anticipated, okay. Because many of the 
applicants at that time had already had two years

27:17.053 --> 27:37.783
in agriculture or quite a few of them even had BS 
degrees in agriculture, so all year related

27:17.053 --> 27:37.783
biological

27:17.053 --> 27:37.783
sciences.

27:41.560 --> 27:51.110
Then

27:41.560 --> 27:51.110
they went along, though, until 1941 when the war 
broke out.

27:54.333 --> 28:02.242
And again, the veterinary schools were

27:54.333 --> 28:02.242
fighting for students. However, I forget when 
Georgia reopened their school, but anyway, No

28:10.687 --> 28:12.209
more schools went down. Was the school in Georgia 
or was it a Georgia Tech? It was the University of

28:19.199 --> 28:26.029
Georgia at Athens.

28:26.771 --> 28:31.798
Then in 1945, the war was over and the first crop of 
veterans came in. Again, many more students

28:33.560 --> 28:38.027
applied than were

28:43.357 --> 28:44.598
able to be accommodated. So the various colleges 
got together and put in a pre-veterinary, how do

28:46.901 --> 28:58.855
you call it? Curriculum. No, prerequisite. Oh, 
prerequisite. In reality, it meant two years

29:04.602 --> 29:07.405
pre-vet. Right. Even that didn't stop. the 
veterinary students. So... Was this the American

29:15.634 --> 29:22.744
Veterinarian Association that got together 
and... No, the... Or was it an intercollegiate? It

29:22.764 --> 29:23.806
was intercollegiate. Mm-hmm. With, of course, 
the approval and blessing of the AVMA, but the AVMA

29:25.408 --> 29:32.539
was only in advisory capacity. Right. Those 
fellows in Chicago can't tell. It's like

29:34.982 --> 29:38.507
explaining to them how to run the school, you see. 
Oh, absolutely. Right. But they do have a...

29:46.570 --> 29:54.701
a so-called accredited list that you have to 
graduate from a certain type of school before you

29:46.570 --> 29:54.701
become a member of the AMMA. Well, or rather to be 
from a college recognized by the AMMA.

30:04.435 --> 30:11.785
So with the two-year prerequisite deal, many of 
the

30:15.427 --> 30:44.725
subjects that before had been offered in 
veterinary school, like, for example, English,

30:15.427 --> 30:44.725
entomology,

30:15.427 --> 30:44.725
mathematics, physics, and so forth, were 
transferred to the two-year pre-vet school, and

30:15.427 --> 30:44.725
that allowed the veterinary school proper the 
four years of pre-professional training to

30:45.818 --> 30:52.687
concentrate primarily on veterinary medicine 
and veterinary medicine alone. So it was

30:52.707 --> 30:57.853
basically, after the Second World War, then it was 
basically switched to a six-year program. Yes.

31:01.437 --> 31:15.555
And so the curriculum

31:01.437 --> 31:15.555
was established

31:01.437 --> 31:15.555
by the Association of Veterinary Colleges, 
actually it's an association of beings.

31:22.020 --> 31:23.267
And...
