WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:04.666
Nicknames that you recall? That I was called? No, 
anybody. Anybody? That you remember. Everybody

00:08.012 --> 00:08.873
had a nickname. Yeah. Normally it was, it could be 
ethnic origin, Greek. We had four or five Greek

00:14.222 --> 00:16.606
Americans. We would just call them Greek. The rest 
of them were just kind of a shortened of their name.

00:20.652 --> 00:22.235
Very few people were called by their regular name. 
What about the Hispanics? What were they called? I

00:28.064 --> 00:29.667
don't recall.

00:31.739 --> 00:40.294
Obviously there were the Hispanics, there was no 
ethnic sensitivities back in those days, but it

00:31.739 --> 00:40.294
was always with respect. I don't remember 
anything really derogatory on an ethnic basis.

00:45.344 --> 00:48.890
You know, if you call somebody a Greek or whatever, 
it's because he was Greek. What about faculty

00:49.251 --> 00:52.296
nicknames? Oh, well, all the faculty members had 
names. Unless they were really good professors

00:55.144 --> 01:05.236
who had no idiosyncrasies, but as you know, as a 
former professor, and I've been an adjunct

00:55.144 --> 01:05.236
professor, most professors have some somewhat 
idiosyncratic. But share some of those with me

01:05.376 --> 01:07.699
that you remember. Well, Shaky Joe R. was one civil 
engineering professor, and that was kind of a

01:07.719 --> 01:15.829
low-class thing to call him because he had some 
kind of shake in his right hand there. Shaky Joe. My

01:18.172 --> 01:22.317
sanitary engineering professor, we called him 
Fecal Joe, Joe Sorrells. Dr.

01:23.275 --> 01:29.304
Harrington was just Doc. I don't know where he got 
that name, Doc Harrington. Is that M.T. or no? No,

01:33.351 --> 01:33.671
no. No, I had no relationship. Same last name, but 
no relationship. A real character. We would

01:39.941 --> 01:42.365
normally call them by what they taught. What about 
English or math or chemistry?

01:47.828 --> 01:52.114
Well, of course, we all took about the same 
curriculum our freshman and sophomore year. So

01:52.194 --> 01:54.076
those were kind of the mass. We didn't quite get as 
close to professors of freshman and sophomore

01:54.837 --> 01:58.362
year as we did. But normally in our junior and 
senior years in civil engineering, we'd call them

01:59.383 --> 02:04.790
by what they taught. Concrete Bill or Steel John or 
Fecal Joe. And if they had certain

02:09.096 --> 02:13.482
idiosyncrasies, we'd call them by that. One of my 
favorite of that period was J.G.H. Thompson in

02:17.913 --> 02:18.995
Emmy. He was alphabet. Alphabet Thompson? I think 
I remember that, yeah. All right, let's see. We're

02:25.403 --> 02:28.267
getting near the end now. What are the key events or 
traditions or practices that make up the basis for

02:28.287 --> 02:43.047
Aggie feelings, love? Dedication. Kind of the 
rallying points. What's in the recipe there?

02:50.061 --> 03:03.234
Well, certainly

02:50.061 --> 03:03.234
kind of the umbrella is the Association of Former 
Students, which is, as anybody knowledgeable

02:50.061 --> 03:03.234
knows, you know being in the Big Eight and the Big 12 
at Missouri. And I've looked at alumni

03:03.375 --> 03:10.502
organizations throughout the country because 
I've had the opportunity to spend a lot of time in my

03:03.375 --> 03:10.502
profession at various universities. And I've 
always made it kind of a habit to go back and look at

03:12.635 --> 03:18.724
their alumni organizations to see how it operates 
compared to the Association of Former Students.

03:19.626 --> 03:26.977
And with that being braggadocio, braggadocio, 
there's no organization that even comes close.

03:27.338 --> 03:29.942
All right, but why do Aggie, alums feel that way 
about their school? Well, certainly it goes back

03:32.998 --> 03:36.322
to their college experience back in those days. I 
thought it would probably end when the Corps

03:36.423 --> 03:42.230
became not the dominating factor, but that hasn't 
really proved to be true. I've had three daughters

03:42.951 --> 03:52.384
who've gone there, and they rallied to the same 
rallying points that I do, all three of whom were in

03:42.951 --> 03:52.384
sororities, and didn't really spend a lot of time 
dating guys in the Corps. So, of course, they all

03:52.564 --> 03:59.112
went there as young children, so they got imbued in 
the scene. But I think your college days certainly

04:00.803 --> 04:06.669
is a great starting point. College at any 
university should be a gratifying experience.

04:10.734 --> 04:21.605
That's when you really go from somebody who's not 
productive, even the end product of a university,

04:10.734 --> 04:21.605
to somebody who is productive, who contributes to 
the GNV, contributes to the social aspects of

04:10.734 --> 04:21.605
society. But I think A&M was special in that it had 
such a tradition itself, being a land grant

04:21.806 --> 04:29.494
school, being a military school, being an 
all-male school. in the tradition of Virginia

04:29.997 --> 04:41.213
military, Virginia Tech, Clemson, as you 
mentioned earlier, gave you kind of a special

04:29.997 --> 04:41.213
status. And I think that was the rallying point. So 
people now in their 50s and 60s who had that special

04:43.637 --> 04:54.132
time in the Corps of Cadets and shared the 
male-dominated scene have that special feeling.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.802
But it's carried on after the Corps became less of a 
factor. Still a major factor, but

04:59.822 --> 05:03.808
percentage-wise, the student body is much 
smaller, of course. Are there any events while an

05:03.828 --> 05:11.559
Aggie is a student that are essential ingredients 
in this loyalty feeling? Well, certainly the

05:11.579 --> 05:21.333
muster and certainly the

05:11.579 --> 05:21.333
football weekends, the muster, I guess, are the 
two biggest events. Graduation, the

05:21.393 --> 05:24.878
commissioning. Those things come to mind as being 
kind of the highlights. Are there any physical

05:28.521 --> 05:30.503
things? Any tangible things?

05:35.668 --> 05:38.091
Which promotes the loyalty to the school? You mean 
outside the campus? Like what's on your face? Oh,

05:42.315 --> 05:43.056
the Aggie ring. Well, sure. Aggie ring's unique.

05:49.103 --> 05:51.405
Certainly...

05:52.263 --> 05:54.466
When I first put on my Aggie ring, it was obvious. I 
mean, you could spot them wherever you went, so

05:54.566 --> 06:07.946
when you'd notice an Aggie ring, it was 
immediately a point of conversation, which I have

05:54.566 --> 06:07.946
appreciated and enjoyed in all parts of the world. 
On airplanes and foreign countries, when you see

06:08.387 --> 06:11.672
an Aggie ring, it's pretty obvious. Do you 
remember what it cost you? Yeah, I do. It seemed

06:13.975 --> 06:15.497
like it was about $85. And did that $85 come easy? 
No. Well, as I recall, the association picked up

06:20.173 --> 06:22.696
half of it. I may have paid half of that, $45 or 
something. Now, did you all have any ritual or

06:25.380 --> 06:30.286
routine of what you would do when you got the ring? 
Well, there was the ring dance, of course, which

06:30.306 --> 06:35.974
you have your, in this case, my future wife. Well, 
she puts the ring on under the big ring envelope

06:38.378 --> 06:41.642
there. One ritual, which I'm not even sure, it was 
upside down when you were a senior, and then when

06:42.263 --> 06:47.829
you graduate, you turn it right side up. I'm not 
sure if that's still a tradition or not. I don't

06:49.530 --> 06:50.131
know either. Today, I understand that with some of 
them, you're supposed to put it in a pitcher of beer

06:51.913 --> 06:58.239
and chug a lot, but y'all didn't do that. That's 
something. God forbid if you have to swallow it.

07:01.562 --> 07:04.065
Well, apparently that has happened a couple of 
times. No, there's a lot of traditions that we

07:04.305 --> 07:08.849
didn't have there, and a lot of traditions we had 
then that are not enjoyed today. Let's see. Are you

07:11.845 --> 07:16.751
at liberty to say anything about any secret 
fraternities? Well, there was none there when I

07:17.312 --> 07:19.615
was there. There was the TTs before I got there, 
which was kind of flushed out. I just read about it

07:23.359 --> 07:28.906
because I had a brother in school at that time when 
that was a big deal. We never had any secret

07:28.926 --> 07:31.289
fraternities at all when I was there. That I knew 
about, if it were secret, they were very good

07:31.730 --> 07:37.397
secret because neither I nor my friends, many of 
them were student leaders and core leaders, I

07:39.419 --> 07:40.641
didn't even hear about it. I didn't hear about any 
in the 60s and 70s if they were there. Frankly, we

07:45.987 --> 07:58.103
were too busy with core activities and our 
curriculum and our social life, which was pretty

07:45.987 --> 07:58.103
normal, to fool anything like that. All right. 
Only two or three more questions. What did it, as

08:02.288 --> 08:05.973
you look back, what did it mean to you that you 
attended Texas A&M? Well, it... It was the

08:08.849 --> 08:15.579
springboard really into my profession, to my 
maturity, I think into good citizenship. I guess

08:16.421 --> 08:26.656
the thing that I remember that I think was probably 
the biggest jumpstart by going to A&M, when I

08:16.421 --> 08:26.656
attributed all of this to the corporate edge, is 
that I simply didn't have time to do anything.

08:27.498 --> 08:28.780
Every minute was occupied. And today, see I got out 
in 59, so it's almost 40 years later. I feel like I

08:36.237 --> 08:40.205
have the ability to use my time effectively in my 
profession in this room. When I get in the morning,

08:41.708 --> 08:49.003
everything is programmed so that every minute, 
when I play, I play, but when I work, I work, and it's

08:41.708 --> 08:49.003
organized. And I attribute that really to the fact 
that I just had no time, particularly as a freshman

08:49.043 --> 08:57.621
and sophomore at A&M, to do anything except my core 
activities and my education. It's just a

08:58.580 --> 09:11.115
wonderful, through the accident of going to A&M at 
that period of time, it's a wonderful, I think,

08:58.580 --> 09:11.115
training that has served me well in my profession 
throughout my career. Last question. Yeah. What

09:13.478 --> 09:16.361
feelings do you hold in your heart now for Texas 
A&M? Well, the same as, I guess, my colleagues. I

09:20.546 --> 09:23.390
think the taxpayers got their money's worth. When 
you look at what A&M graduates have done in

09:28.718 --> 09:32.461
society, and I'm not sure what the yardstick is. 
It's probably give back to society producing a lot

09:33.362 --> 09:43.291
of the wealth of our state, giving it back 
unselfishly. It's a special feeling, and it's

09:43.912 --> 09:48.636
common through all my friends. I mean, it's an easy 
thing. So it was, again, that comes at a very

09:52.019 --> 09:57.544
special time in your life when you come in as a 16- or 
17-year-old. Forget about what your IQ is or what

09:58.520 --> 10:01.263
your propensity to learning is. You're immature. 
We thought we were kind of hot shots because we had a

10:04.507 --> 10:08.871
great high school. I had a great high school 
career. And I thought I was ready for anything. But

10:12.716 --> 10:13.256
you're not. But when you come out of A&M, you're 21 
or 22 years old. You've got a basic education. You

10:19.984 --> 10:21.385
understand the basic sciences. You understand 
what the world's like a little bit more. You have

10:24.889 --> 10:28.493
strong friendships which stay with you for the 
rest of your life. It's a state institution. The

10:33.338 --> 10:38.025
taxpayers pay, now it's 30% or 40% of the state 
taxpayers. But the federal and the state pick up a

10:38.085 --> 10:40.729
good portion. What they don't pay, your parents 
do. But the state wants a return on that

10:43.073 --> 10:46.017
investment. And I'd venture to say that the return 
on investment of A&M has probably been the best of

10:47.119 --> 10:55.632
any university in the country, state university, 
maybe private or public. Again, you can't put a

10:55.652 --> 10:58.176
yardstick to that, but I'm out in society. We've 
got this country right now, and I've always felt

10:58.561 --> 11:06.613
that way, that the best deal a taxpayer's ever got 
was sending a kid to A&M.
