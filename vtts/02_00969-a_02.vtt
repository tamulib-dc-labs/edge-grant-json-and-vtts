00:01.027 --> 00:07.313
Mark, the question, what operations were you 
involved in that were successes? One time we were

00:07.774 --> 00:11.077
flying, and our airplane was very distinct. You 
could recognize it in the air, no problem. And our

00:13.500 --> 00:16.062
call sign was a provider. Because that's what we 
did, we provided. They said, provider, we got a

00:18.585 --> 00:21.408
call on emergency frequency. They said, 
provider, flying over. They gave the name of the

00:25.231 --> 00:26.353
base. They said, would you, we have a... a request, 
could you land? Because I have a request to make of

00:32.132 --> 00:34.035
you. And are you on a mission that you can't land or 
could you come down? And I said, yes, we can land.

00:38.382 --> 00:45.273
Because I don't mean to imply that I was 
belligerent or I didn't respond to orders or

00:38.382 --> 00:45.273
anything. But my orders were to fly a particular 
mission. But I did deviate. And I didn't hesitate

00:50.801 --> 00:52.003
to deviate. And in some cases, as I think most 
pilots will tell you, most of us use the old trick of

00:56.630 --> 01:24.730
if we didn't want to hear what they were telling us 
we would come back and say i'm sorry your

00:56.630 --> 01:24.730
transmission was garbled i can't read you you know 
the radio is breaking up and this particular time i

00:56.630 --> 01:24.730
did do what my order said not to do i landed at a 
forward base i shouldn't have landed at but when i

00:56.630 --> 01:24.730
landed it was a marine base and they said are you 
going to saigon i said no i'm not but i can't go to

00:56.630 --> 01:24.730
saigon Fan Rang was on the coast, not inland. 
Saigon was inland. And Saigon had the only

01:30.470 --> 01:33.215
mortuary in country. I said, well, we have a young 
Marine who was killed three days ago, and we need to

01:34.317 --> 01:42.751
get his body to the mortuary in Saigon. The young 
Marine's body had been in a body bag for three days.

01:46.968 --> 01:49.011
And it had one plane fly over. And when they told 
them what they wanted, they refused to land, which

01:49.131 --> 01:59.965
really, as a, you could see how it really affected 
them. So when they asked us to land, they didn't

02:00.005 --> 02:03.610
tell us what they wanted. And we said, yes, we'll 
take the body back. We opened the cargo. the ramp,

02:08.804 --> 02:12.490
put the body in the back and strapped it down. Then 
we opened the windows in front of the airplane and

02:12.510 --> 02:16.978
all sat in the front of the airplane to fly back. You 
couldn't stand to be close to that body. And as we

02:21.606 --> 02:26.074
took off, they lined the runway as we took off. And 
we made one pass back through, and they all saluted

02:26.094 --> 02:31.683
and waved as we left, which made the whole... It 
wasn't a mission that was planned. It wasn't a

02:33.286 --> 02:34.508
mission that... that would mean anything to 
anybody except to those men and to us. And it was one

02:41.071 --> 02:43.394
of the most gratifying things that we did. And we 
got to Saigon, of course. There was a call for me to

02:46.739 --> 02:48.742
call the commander. And I called the commander. 
And he gave me as much of a reprimand as he could but

02:51.205 --> 02:57.655
understood what we had done. So it was nothing to 
get in trouble over. But the other people had

03:00.118 --> 03:02.622
followed their orders to a T. They had not landed. 
They had not transported the body. But that was a

03:06.540 --> 03:08.523
very satisfying thing to do. So in what you're 
saying, there are times within war that you've got

03:09.264 --> 03:22.526
to deviate from your orders or you have to deviate 
from certain things because circumstances do not

03:09.264 --> 03:22.526
always allow you to follow to the letter of the law. 
That's another point. We fought the war. not as a

03:28.842 --> 03:30.806
war, as a police action. And we didn't fight it 
under wartime rules. We fought under peacetime

03:35.517 --> 03:36.860
rules. As a safety officer, my first six months in 
country, I was supposed to enforce safety rules. I

03:43.523 --> 03:48.211
was supposed to go around to the squadrons and 
watch them fly and tell them how to fly safe. And

03:48.812 --> 03:52.458
never could I figure out how you fly safely when 
someone is shooting at you. I flew with the 310th

03:53.039 --> 03:57.887
Air Commando Wing. I flew with the 12th Air 
Commando Wing. The 12th was the defoliant. that

04:03.233 --> 04:09.663
dropped the agent on the trees that killed the 
leaves so that you could see what was underneath

04:03.233 --> 04:09.663
them. Those people flew 100 foot above the ground. 
They flew at 10 to 15 feet above the treetops.

04:17.916 --> 04:19.058
There's nothing safe about that. There's no 
regulation in the military code that says you can

04:19.619 --> 04:25.948
fly that low and that slow over treetops. And they 
literally were just hedgehogging all the time.

04:31.229 --> 04:44.751
When I flew with them, they wore very, very heavy 
flight jackets, and their airplanes were

04:31.229 --> 04:44.751
shielded underneath, but they were still not 
protected from ground fire. They would take a hit

04:45.031 --> 04:54.486
in the front of the airplane that could cause an 
airplane crash, and they knew this all the time. If

04:54.905 --> 04:59.571
I, as a safety officer, wanted to be safe and not get 
killed, I would tell them to fly much higher. But

04:59.731 --> 05:03.756
then they can't fly higher because the foliant 
would not hit the areas it's supposed to hit. It

05:04.557 --> 05:06.379
would kill the trees. It would also kill the rice. 
If you kill the crops that the South Vietnamese

05:08.121 --> 05:15.891
were growing, you've done more damage than if you 
didn't do anything at all. So to tell those people

05:16.692 --> 05:23.781
to fly safely, to be a safety officer, was not easy. 
I had to tell them to park their airplanes a certain

05:24.335 --> 05:30.905
distance apart, the wingtips to be a certain 
distance apart. But in many cases, they didn't

05:31.787 --> 05:34.811
have enough room to park the airplanes. They had to 
overlap the wings, overlap whatever they could to

05:34.851 --> 05:38.837
park them. You just couldn't draw peacetime lines 
on the ramp. And yet, the safety people from

05:46.272 --> 05:56.783
Seventh Air Force on down expected reports that 
would go up, just like a peacetime operation, if it

05:46.272 --> 05:56.783
was anything but a peacetime operation. There's 
one particular operation that I can tell you

05:57.123 --> 06:03.169
about, and it's the time that you landed and didn't 
crack an egg. Oh. Not one egg. Well, that's what we

06:05.211 --> 06:07.273
did. The C-123, the tires on C-123 were large. 
mainly because the assault landings would make.

06:14.682 --> 06:18.186
You'd actually assault the ground when you hit 
because you were coming down right on stall speed.

06:18.767 --> 06:21.771
You hit the ground, chop the power, and stop almost 
immediately. We could land and take off in less

06:22.371 --> 06:25.034
than 2,000 feet. Now, that sounds like a lot to the 
average person, but consider that the airports

06:25.215 --> 06:36.107
that you're used to flying from are miles long, 
miles and miles and miles, like at Bergstrom.

06:36.509 --> 06:43.496
Bergstrom, the runway, is 150 feet wide, and it's 
two miles long, or longer. And it's just that long.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.243
But we were landing in like 2,000 feet, which is 
less than a half mile. So when you take off and land

06:51.645 --> 06:55.869
that much, your tires take a lot of abuse. And we 
took off on one, and all the tread on the tire, on one

06:56.670 --> 07:03.878
tire, completely peeled off. The tire was down 
to... just the basic tire itself, almost like a

07:06.648 --> 07:09.872
tube. And I had on board at the time, it was one of 
those missions where we were doing the Vietnamese

07:11.033 --> 07:23.487
a favor by transporting important people from one 
place to another. I had the Vietnamese family on

07:24.228 --> 07:26.691
board. I had two cows, chickens, all their crops, 
and everything that they owned on board the

07:26.711 --> 07:36.182
airplane. And various and sundry places on the 
airplane. We had to land. When we landed, it was

07:42.236 --> 07:44.759
back on a foamed runway. And I landed. And I did not 
land normally where you'd have the power way back.

07:52.326 --> 07:54.008
I landed what we call hot. I landed fairly fast 
because I didn't want the airplane to stall just

07:54.168 --> 08:01.595
above the runway or on final approach. And with all 
these things on board, I think we even had a goat on

08:02.796 --> 08:06.540
board, if I remember correctly. And there was a 
wire basket with eggs in it that was sitting on the

08:07.195 --> 08:13.924
floor. And the crew on the plane was the pilot, the 
co-pilot. They would have a load master. And the

08:20.092 --> 08:21.254
load master was up front. And his challenge, he 
says, Captain, if you can land without breaking

08:22.335 --> 08:29.905
those eggs, he says, I'll declare that this is the 
greatest flight I've ever been on. And the key

08:30.886 --> 08:35.312
thing, of course, was to land safely. We expected 
the tire to blow out when we hit. The tire didn't

08:39.449 --> 08:40.511
blow out. We landed safely. Didn't break an egg. 
And the write-up in the paper, of course, talked

08:44.296 --> 08:48.461
about the chickens and the cows and the people. Our 
main concern, of course, was to save the airplane,

08:49.603 --> 08:52.346
which we did. We changed the tire, continued the 
mission. Everything was OK. Of course, what

08:55.531 --> 08:59.075
everybody remembers is I didn't break any eggs. 
Were you ever involved in any classified

08:59.135 --> 09:04.843
missions? There were, yes, several classified 
missions. And most of them are not unclassified to

09:09.085 --> 09:13.473
my knowledge as yet. But there is one that was 
classified, highly classified. That was the most

09:17.781 --> 09:24.293
enjoyable mission I had that I'm sure is 
unclassified now. One of the most, a lot of secrets

09:24.313 --> 09:27.338
in Vietnam didn't stay secret because it would be 
published in the Stars and Stripes. And the

09:31.536 --> 09:38.445
Vietnamese would take what we threw away in our 
trash cans home with them and put it together. And

09:38.625 --> 09:46.696
the Stars and Stripes normally would tell troop 
movements, a lot of things that should have been

09:38.625 --> 09:46.696
continued to be classified. But the one thing that 
was very classified was the movement of Bob Hope.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.288
And the year I was over there, came over. And he had 
two people with him that I will never forget, one

09:54.789 --> 10:02.820
being Raquel Welch, for obvious reasons, the 
other being Barbara McNair. And we were assigned

10:03.621 --> 10:12.113
as they flew mostly in C-130s, which were larger 
aircraft than C-121. I mean, they flew in C-131s

10:13.235 --> 10:21.186
rather than our aircraft. But we flew some support 
people around. We flew some of their equipment

10:24.986 --> 10:26.208
around. And where we were going was highly 
classified. And no one knew, because it would have

10:29.793 --> 10:38.484
been a pretty big coup for the Vietnamese to have 
captured, killed, or hurt some of these troops

10:29.793 --> 10:38.484
coming over. And

10:39.485 --> 10:44.712
we knew where they were going each day. And the one 
day that they were going to be at Pham Rang, was the

10:47.913 --> 10:51.779
day that I really tried to get back in time for the 
show. Because that was the central point for

10:52.340 --> 10:56.446
people to congregate to see the show. And we had 
maybe 4,000 or 5,000 people there to see the show.

11:00.612 --> 11:04.858
And that one, I was flying their equipment back. 
And my mission said, don't even mention where

11:09.192 --> 11:10.774
you're going. But fortunately, I was going back to 
my home base. I knew they were going to be there. So

11:14.901 --> 11:18.006
it was very satisfying to have a mission 
completed. Well, that was the time when I was late

11:18.366 --> 11:21.311
getting to the show. And one of the people that 
worked with me had saved a seat for me. And I was

11:25.838 --> 11:27.220
right on the stage. Very satisfying. What 
operations or missions were you involved in that

11:31.948 --> 11:36.094
you would consider failures? Well, most of the 
missions I flew, I had the opportunity to change

11:37.407 --> 11:43.035
them. If they were, quote, failing, I could do 
something about it and had the opportunity to.

11:50.906 --> 11:52.028
Now, that wasn't true of everyone. Some people, 
like the one I mentioned, if they were flying the

11:52.929 --> 12:00.380
wrong things into a base, they didn't have the 
opportunity to change it. I did. I went so far as to

12:02.821 --> 12:10.270
literally disobey orders to go over someone's 
head to change it, and did. And that was simply

12:10.290 --> 12:23.305
because I had come in at a wing staff position, had 
gotten to know the people at the top, and the rank

12:10.290 --> 12:23.305
that I could throw around helped me in flying the 
missions. If I had not been separated from my

12:24.106 --> 12:31.815
family, and if we hadn't been participating in it, 
area where one night you might have supper with

12:32.420 --> 12:38.747
someone and eat a hamburger with them and be 
talking to them, and next night they'd be dead. If

12:39.408 --> 12:42.952
that hadn't been happening, it would have been the 
best flying assignment I ever had. It was very

12:43.312 --> 12:44.193
satisfying. It was very enjoyable flying. It was 
just, it was kind of like when you have a family

12:46.415 --> 12:51.961
reunion and you all get together because someone 
has died. It's nice to get together, but you hate

12:52.302 --> 12:54.444
the occasion. I enjoyed the flying. I just wasn't 
under good circumstances. What was your view of

13:00.483 --> 13:02.906
the ARVN? Well, I didn't have a lot of contact with 
them, and most of the views I could express would be

13:04.588 --> 13:10.816
what someone else said. They seemed to be... It 
would depend on individual units. Some units

13:20.108 --> 13:23.612
functioned very well, were good counterparts. 
Other units seemed to be do-nothing units. So it

13:27.466 --> 13:29.869
depended on who you were working with. I worked 
with very good units. So I have a very high opinion

13:33.113 --> 13:43.026
of those folks, of the ranger groups that we had in 
Vietnam, the Green Berets, the Special Forces.

13:43.406 --> 13:44.648
All those folks were... I worked with very good 
ones. What was your view of the Vietnamese people

13:47.131 --> 13:50.835
as a whole?

13:53.919 --> 13:54.520
There were... Just like if you walked in inner city 
New York or inner city Chicago, you're going to

13:56.170 --> 14:07.164
find people who are doing things different than 
they do at Gladewater or College Station or

13:56.170 --> 14:07.164
wherever. In Saigon itself, you can find every 
kind of vice, every kind of person that you wanted

14:08.165 --> 14:14.734
to find. There are very good people who deserved a 
better life than what they have now under a

14:14.774 --> 14:21.603
communist reign. There are very good people who 
deserve to have better than a group of people like

14:25.617 --> 14:34.681
the American GI coming in with nothing on his mind 
but to have a girl and a drink. They were very good

14:34.701 --> 14:40.656
people who wanted a life of their own but couldn't 
have it because of the French the Americans, the

14:41.041 --> 14:49.753
North Vietnamese, the Communist regime, because 
of graft and corruption within their own people.

14:51.295 --> 15:02.250
It was not, in the hotel that we were in, there was a 
little cafe across the street, and we would go over

14:51.295 --> 15:02.250
there and not eat anything, but I would drink Coke. 
I thought Coke was pretty safe. I thought that

15:04.213 --> 15:06.576
until one night one of the guys found a, a screw in 
his Coke bottle. It was jingling as he drank it, and

15:09.048 --> 15:12.572
we realized it must have been homemade. It tastes 
like Coke, but that kind of gave us second thoughts

15:12.873 --> 15:17.519
about drinking Coke. But when you're sitting 
there on an unusual off, or a motorcycle, or drive

15:18.139 --> 15:29.114
up, and a young man jump off of them and come in and 
say, my little sister, my little sister, for, or

15:18.139 --> 15:29.114
how much they thought they could get for her little 
sister. And when they're peddling their little

15:29.594 --> 15:32.378
sister, And they wouldn't go up to the Vietnamese 
thing to say, just to the Americans. And the

15:40.349 --> 15:42.411
Americans responded readily. They made a lot of 
money off of Americans through prostitution that

15:43.052 --> 15:50.862
wouldn't have been there otherwise. But there 
were a lot of good people, just like in the States.

15:55.628 --> 15:56.469
There were a lot of good people. A lot took 
advantage of who was there. The people out that

16:00.174 --> 16:03.158
were working for a living, the farmers, They were 
looking to stay alive. Survival. How did you view

16:11.513 --> 16:13.135
the enemy? Did you have a personal view? Do you have 
a strong hatred for the enemy? Did you understand

16:21.942 --> 16:26.506
the enemy's purpose and your own purpose? How did 
you view the enemy as a whole? Well, that's like...

16:34.930 --> 16:39.698
Like the enemy was hard to really put a handle on, if 
you will. The enemy was this force that was trying

16:40.259 --> 16:45.448
to take over this country. The enemy wasn't that 
guy or that guy. And the enemy really wasn't those

16:48.573 --> 16:55.064
guys in black pajamas that were coming down this 
trail and infiltrating. That didn't seem to be the

16:55.726 --> 16:56.928
enemy. The enemy was some larger force out here. 
And that enemy moving down through Vietnam,

17:00.968 --> 17:11.260
moving down through Cambodia, that enemy taking 
over was, it was like cancer. It was like if you

17:11.841 --> 17:16.787
don't do something about it, it's going to spread 
rampant. And that was how I, you didn't, the

17:17.488 --> 17:27.279
immediate enemy, like when the camp was overrun 
and they were shooting us, that was the immediate

17:17.488 --> 17:27.279
enemy. But that wasn't the enemy that people 
looked at. You got yourself in more of a gunfight or

17:30.820 --> 17:34.986
a survival situation. But as I looked at it, and I 
think as most people I'm associated with looked at

17:35.707 --> 17:43.358
it as, we're trying to stop communism spreading to 
this part of the world. And sometimes you'd be very

17:44.299 --> 17:49.427
upset because you seem to be more concerned about 
it than the people in the country were. Sometimes

17:50.468 --> 17:52.571
they were trying to just live their normal life. 
Just let me open my restaurant today and serve

17:53.332 --> 17:56.837
food. I don't care if I serve it to the Americans, 
the French, or the Italians, or the Vietnamese, or

17:59.778 --> 18:05.648
the Vietcong, just let me serve my food and make a 
living. You think, no, you should be just serving

18:06.029 --> 18:09.815
us because we're here to save you. And we were not 
really, not

18:10.637 --> 18:20.113
really that, we didn't go in there to find out about 
the Vietnamese. I didn't learn any Vietnamese. In

18:21.555 --> 18:22.056
fact, my My only two words that I ever knew were stop 
and rat poison, and stop because I was riding my

18:22.627 --> 18:32.317
motorcycle, and rat poison because they put rat 
poison out and wanted to keep the kids from eating

18:22.627 --> 18:32.317
it.

18:35.681 --> 18:39.365
Vietnam was not like any other place around. You 
could see an enemy all around you. You saw an enemy

18:42.468 --> 18:48.894
when you realized that the people living in the 
cardboard box when the monsoons came were going to

18:42.468 --> 18:48.894
be out of a home. It was just a tear right on them. You 
could see an enemy in one particular day. We were

18:55.565 --> 19:01.532
down by the Saigon River, which looked like where 
they dumped all the sewage, and it flowed

18:55.565 --> 19:01.532
somewhere. And it was little kids asleep on a 
bench. And at the time, I had a two-year-old and a

19:05.616 --> 19:13.745
three-year-old that I wasn't going to see until 
they were three and four years old. This little kid

19:14.186 --> 19:18.090
was about four, and I was going to go over and look at 
the little kid. And it was asleep, kind of curled up

19:18.611 --> 19:20.713
on the bench. And as I walked over to look at him, I 
leaned over to look at it. And its ear, there was

19:23.982 --> 19:29.109
completely green pus that completely filled the 
kid's ear. And it just sickened me to know that

19:29.630 --> 19:38.081
there was another enemy there, an enemy that 
wasn't letting them take care of their kids the way

19:29.630 --> 19:38.081
they wanted to. I guess they wanted to. But they 
couldn't take care of them. They didn't have the

19:42.587 --> 19:46.853
medical facilities or the care to take care of 
them. So there were a lot of enemies, if you will.

19:50.152 --> 19:55.119
Not just I could take this guy in black pajamas and 
he was the enemy. What about your views on

19:57.302 --> 20:03.611
selective service?

20:05.293 --> 20:09.399
You'll have to consider I'm, what, 52, 53. I don't 
know how old I am. But

20:12.123 --> 20:16.249
when I was growing up, The draft was in effect. And a 
lot of ways that Americans saw to take care of some

20:19.104 --> 20:28.317
problems was to send someone to go in the Army. And 
they'd say, quote, that will straighten him out. I

20:31.020 --> 20:32.502
didn't understand what that meant at the time. But 
later on, I began to realize, and especially now I

20:33.304 --> 20:42.777
realize, that when an individual doesn't receive 
discipline at home, the parents or whoever waits

20:44.242 --> 20:47.585
for that discipline to come. The military had the 
discipline that some individuals needed. And you

20:54.272 --> 20:58.516
would hear a comment, the military really 
straightened him out. What the military has done

20:58.937 --> 21:10.028
for a lot of individuals was to give them 
responsibility, teach them the discipline, and

20:58.937 --> 21:10.028
literally make good citizens out of them. I think 
selective service was the greatest thing that we

21:10.048 --> 21:14.012
had for people who didn't know what direction they 
wanted to go. It was a good starting point to learn

21:19.864 --> 21:25.711
how to live with other people and to learn a trade, 
if you will. This will get off the subject a little

21:27.633 --> 21:32.499
bit, but the Air Force itself is the largest 
business in the world. And the Air Force can train

21:32.519 --> 21:39.207
you to do more things in civilian life than 
anything else. It really is. So I think selective

21:41.755 --> 21:48.202
service was indeed a good program. What about your 
views about the National Guardsmen during

21:49.323 --> 21:53.027
Vietnam? Do you feel that they should have been 
called over to serve in Vietnam or expected to

21:53.047 --> 21:59.274
serve in Vietnam? Expected to serve is a good word, 
not called over to serve. I felt all the time that we

22:03.038 --> 22:06.322
had plenty of people in Vietnam. We had plenty of 
equipment in Vietnam. We had plenty of know-how in

22:07.883 --> 22:09.565
Vietnam. We did not use it to its full potential. We 
did not fight a war as we know how to fight a war. If we

22:17.721 --> 22:24.993
had not dropped the atomic bomb in Japan, we may 
still be fighting the Japanese. We never took that

22:25.594 --> 22:28.920
kind of action in Vietnam.

22:36.258 --> 22:46.013
All right, the next question that I'd like to ask 
you is how you felt about the one year tour of duty

22:36.258 --> 22:46.013
that was initiated in Vietnam.

22:48.237 --> 22:53.265
I found that to be the biggest restriction to 
really getting anything done. Because when you

22:53.365 --> 22:59.494
arrive in country, you would spend two to three 
months learning your job. And then you could spend

22:59.935 --> 23:03.801
six months doing your job and then spend two to 
three months getting ready to come home as you knew

23:04.540 --> 23:30.801
when you were coming home as opposed to the to the 
world war one or world war two when the troops were

23:04.540 --> 23:30.801
sent overseas they were told you're going you'll 
come home when the war is over i knew exactly when i

23:04.540 --> 23:30.801
left the states when my war would be over my 
personal war would end on february the second and

23:04.540 --> 23:30.801
i'd be on my way back home and that was that's what 
made the war seem like a like a business, like we

23:31.456 --> 23:42.652
were, like a nine to five war, that we were, you knew 
exactly when your tour of duty would be over and

23:31.456 --> 23:42.652
when you'd be coming back. All right. Do you think 
that we could have won the war if politics would

23:44.215 --> 23:50.865
have allowed or if the tour of duties would have 
been longer? The tactics we used would have given

23:53.268 --> 23:56.653
us a a different outcome. To say won or lost is 
probably not a good thing to say. If winning the war

24:04.037 --> 24:12.850
meant that we could have maintained the freedom 
for the South Vietnamese, freedom from

24:04.037 --> 24:12.850
communism, then yes, we could have won the war. We 
could have prevented the infiltration into the

24:13.230 --> 24:20.101
South if we had used the weaponry that we had at our 
disposal. We did not use it. And whether we didn't

24:21.943 --> 24:26.370
use it for politics, whether we didn't use it 
because of military strategy, Whether the

24:26.857 --> 24:32.828
military decided not to use it or whether the 
civilians decided not to use it, I don't know. But

24:33.109 --> 24:41.464
we did not use the weaponry we had to prevent the 
infiltration and to prevent the spread of

24:33.109 --> 24:41.464
communism into South Vietnam. We could have 
prevented that, in my opinion, had we chosen to.

24:47.315 --> 24:49.118
Instead of hitting the Ho Chi Minh Trail, at 
different spots, we could have stopped it at the

24:49.722 --> 24:57.093
source in Hanoi and even farther towards, you 
know, into Vietnam. Where were you during the Tet

24:58.295 --> 25:01.259
Offensive? In the Tet Offensive, I was stationed 
at Phan Rang, flying 123s. And during the first

25:06.187 --> 25:16.102
night of the Tet Offensive, we were not aware that 
it was going on as it was. It started During the

25:17.650 --> 25:21.655
night, we got up next morning and started flying 
regular missions. And those regular missions

25:21.675 --> 25:24.939
were in the middle of the Tet Offensive. And my 
first flight into the... I was flying into

25:28.223 --> 25:29.624
DeLotte. And DeLotte was one of the places that was 
overrun. And I realized then that we were in the

25:32.508 --> 25:38.215
middle of an action larger than normal. And as 
radio contact became established with Saigon via

25:38.936 --> 25:45.784
HF radio, we knew that we were having... the large 
offensive that had been predicted. And I was

25:49.096 --> 25:54.783
diverted to fly ammo into one of the northern spots 
near Da Nang. And in doing so, one

25:55.784 --> 26:08.079
of the missions I flew in, my crew and aircraft were 
specifically ordered back to Phan Rang. And I

26:08.539 --> 26:12.624
found out later that they had pulled all of us out 
who had a short time to go. I was within the last week

26:12.824 --> 26:15.147
of coming home Actually, the last two weeks of 
coming home during the Tet Offensive. And they

26:17.819 --> 26:25.049
pulled me out of there to go back to Phan Rang, not to 
fly any more missions during the combat. All

26:25.069 --> 26:25.510
right. This leads me to my next question. Before 
you went to Vietnam, while you were there, and when

26:29.235 --> 26:42.535
you returned, do you think that the media was 
playing a large role in the Vietnam conflict,

26:29.235 --> 26:42.535
especially since your tour ended so close... to 
the Tet Offensive. When you came home, I'm sure the

26:44.532 --> 26:51.841
press was quite vivid in their description to 
Vietnam. Yes, it was. Before going to Vietnam, I,

26:52.682 --> 27:05.659
like a lot of other people, were 10,000 miles away 
from the action and didn't know that much about it

26:52.682 --> 27:05.659
and really didn't bother to find out that much 
about it. When I received my orders to go to

27:06.200 --> 27:12.808
Southeast Asia, I became very interested in what 
was happening, as did my immediate family. While I

27:14.206 --> 27:28.141
was in Vietnam, the news media, as they told the 
story about Vietnam, sometimes it very much

27:14.206 --> 27:28.141
offended me because sometimes it was not the whole 
truth. It was just part of the truth. Sometimes it

27:29.923 --> 27:31.845
was not even true at all. Sometimes the 
speculation just gets the story. And if you read

27:35.349 --> 27:39.353
just what was published about Vietnam, You didn't 
get to know the people. You didn't get to know the

27:41.952 --> 27:43.874
circumstances. You didn't know why things were 
done. And the frustrating thing was you couldn't

27:46.216 --> 27:48.599
do anything about it. You couldn't go on the news 
the next night and say, now, wait a minute. This

27:52.603 --> 27:54.785
happened this way or this happened that way. And in 
one instance, one of the squadrons that was

27:55.746 --> 28:06.617
stationed in the north had occasion to fly. They 
were on a reconnaissance mission to fly over

28:06.758 --> 28:09.120
Hanoi. And during their reconnaissance mission, 
they were constantly dodging the surface-to-air

28:10.383 --> 28:17.332
missiles. And in this one particular flight, they 
retaliated against a surface-to-air missile

28:17.392 --> 28:25.403
site on the ground, even though they had 
instructions not to. And they knocked the site

28:25.943 --> 28:27.045
out. And by knocking, they had pictures. Their 
camera showed that they hit only the site and

28:30.509 --> 28:33.934
knocked the site out completely. But the news 
media picked up on it. and reported that they had

28:36.438 --> 29:02.530
knocked out a hospital and a school and a lot of 
school children were injured and so forth and so on

28:36.438 --> 29:02.530
the reports that we had through intelligence were 
that they had only hit the sam site nothing else but

28:36.438 --> 29:02.530
the paper really played it up as a as killing a lot of 
civilians and if our if our intelligence was

28:36.438 --> 29:02.530
correct and i have no reason to believe it wasn't 
then that story was not true. It was later

29:04.453 --> 29:12.628
confirmed by Jane Vonda that indeed a hospital had 
been bombed and that didn't sit too well either. So

29:14.652 --> 29:17.397
you do feel that the media played a large role. Do 
you feel like that the times that the media used to

29:22.270 --> 29:29.820
show what was happening in Vietnam during the 
evening meal when everyone sat down to watch the

29:22.270 --> 29:29.820
news. Do you think that bringing the war home was a 
mistake and that that is what turned the American

29:30.221 --> 29:38.572
public against Vietnam? I'm really not sure why 
they were against Vietnam. I felt a lot of people

29:42.477 --> 29:47.203
were against it because we weren't fighting it 
like a war. We were fighting on Like we were in

29:50.688 --> 29:56.594
Vietnam, we were fighting a ground war when we were 
actually more prepared to fight an air war. And the

29:57.695 --> 30:11.108
media itself showed things that would

29:57.695 --> 30:11.108
make you, would change your opinion one way or the 
other on the spot. For instance, the picture of the

30:11.148 --> 30:14.051
individual who was shot in the head. That's a 
famous picture that has been shown millions of

30:17.654 --> 30:19.056
times. And if you were against the war and didn't 
know what the war was all about and didn't care, you

30:19.817 --> 30:32.933
would suddenly have feelings and say, I don't like 
these people that just step up to someone with a gun

30:19.817 --> 30:32.933
and shoot them in the head. You immediately would 
be for whatever you were doing. And then most

30:37.078 --> 30:41.003
people would say, go ahead, kill all of them. But 
who are you killing? What were you killing? What

30:43.346 --> 30:44.087
were you trying to do? Most people were not aware of 
try to stop the spread of communism. You don't stop

30:49.244 --> 30:55.653
the spread of communism by killing that guy who 
showed no mercy for the fellow on television. So

30:56.274 --> 31:03.584
anger and the media would sway people, sometimes 
rightly or wrongly, with what they showed. So you

31:03.905 --> 31:07.430
feel like the media did show things out of context? 
Yeah, and probably not on purpose sometimes.

31:13.198 --> 31:14.880
Sometimes that's all they had to show. Sometimes 
they were not told the full story because it was

31:15.282 --> 31:21.895
either classified or no one was available to tell 
them the full story. And some of the things that

31:22.637 --> 31:31.013
were later came out with Lieutenant Calley were 
indeed
