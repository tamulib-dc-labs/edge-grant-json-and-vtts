WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:06.298
OK, this is Ron Schorn about to interview Wes 
Traub. Wes, count down from 10 or something. 10, 9,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.363
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. OK, this is Thursday, April 22, 
1983. And this is Ron Schorn interviewing Wes

00:16.708 --> 00:25.836
Traub at the Center for Astrophysics here in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts. OK, Wes, your name is?

00:28.459 --> 00:29.800
Wesley Traub. And when were you born? 1940. Where? 
Wisconsin, Milwaukee. How did you first get

00:35.767 --> 00:37.470
interested in astronomy? Oh, well, I guess I was 
interested in astronomy like most kids. It's just

00:44.844 --> 00:45.725
interesting. But the thing that really 
interested me, I remember when I was a teenager,

00:46.286 --> 00:52.077
was spectroscopy, strangely enough. I mean, the 
idea of being able to measure the property of

00:54.698 --> 01:01.868
something that was far away by looking at the 
spectra, you know, Fraunhofer lines and all that

00:54.698 --> 01:01.868
sort of stuff. How did you learn about that? Book in 
the library, go to the Adler Planetarium or what?

01:06.755 --> 01:09.919
Well, we didn't have any planetariums, 
planetaria. It must have been from books, yeah.

01:13.585 --> 01:15.227
Where did you go to undergraduate school? I went to 
the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee for...

01:19.951 --> 01:21.173
Undergraduate four years. Your major was? 
Physics. Actually, the physics, the major was

01:23.156 --> 01:25.619
complicated. It was called Applied Math and 
Engineering Physics. But it was basically lots of

01:28.884 --> 01:31.047
math and physics. And it was great because I didn't 
have to take any other courses. I didn't have to

01:34.732 --> 01:37.036
take any languages, hardly any English. I could 
take math courses all day. Where did you go to grad

01:41.222 --> 01:42.043
school? I went to the University of Wisconsin at 
Madison, the physics department. And I... was

01:50.107 --> 01:58.918
lucky enough then to meet up with

01:50.107 --> 01:58.918
Julian Mack, who was a a spectroscopist working on 
atomic spectroscopy, and was someone who was

02:00.248 --> 02:10.020
present in the late 20s and early 30s for the 
beginning of quantum mechanics. And near the end

02:10.300 --> 02:14.445
of his career, he was my professor at Wisconsin. So 
the stuff that I kind of liked, I just sort of lucked

02:14.485 --> 02:20.872
into at Madison. At that time, were you thinking of 
becoming an astronomer or were you going to be a

02:20.892 --> 02:24.737
physicist? Oh, no. What I was going to do then was to 
go into business with my father, who ran a lumber

02:25.726 --> 02:35.159
company, because I didn't know that people did 
this for a living. By the way, what year did you get

02:35.620 --> 02:40.227
your bachelor's and what year did you get your 
Ph.D.? Okay, bachelor's degree was in 1962, and

02:40.267 --> 02:47.817
Ph.D. was in 68, in physics. What was your 
dissertation on, by the way? Our thesis was on the

02:52.072 --> 02:57.645
abundance of lithium in sunspots.

02:58.226 --> 03:06.165
This was in the physics department, but the 
astronomy department was right upstairs, and so

02:58.226 --> 03:06.165
there was communication.

03:06.348 --> 03:12.079
a piece of equipment that had been invented at 
Wisconsin called a Pepsios interferometer. This

03:12.139 --> 03:24.863
was made up out of three Fabry-Perot 
interferometers put in series so that the light

03:12.139 --> 03:24.863
would come through each one of them, one after the 
other, and selectively isolate narrower and

03:12.139 --> 03:24.863
narrower bands of light Then you would scan the 
instrument from one wavelength to another by

03:25.163 --> 03:32.759
changing the air pressure in between the plates of 
the Fabry-Perot's. This is a wonderful

03:33.541 --> 03:42.480
instrument because it had all of the étendue, the 
light collecting power area and solid angle

03:33.541 --> 03:42.480
product of Fabry-Perot's. which meant that for 
astronomy, you could put a circular object at the

03:43.642 --> 03:58.497
entrance, not a slit, but a round aperture, like a 
star or a planet or the sun, part of the sun, and get

03:43.642 --> 03:58.497
all the light through the instrument at very high 
resolution. It had spectral resolutions of

03:58.597 --> 04:02.922
500,000 to a million in that range. When you 
finished your PhD, where did you get your first job

04:05.104 --> 04:08.367
and why? I got my first and last job here at the 
Smithsonian. And the connection was that while I

04:14.050 --> 04:25.647
was working on my thesis, there was Nat Carlton out 
here at the Smithsonian who had been working in the

04:14.050 --> 04:25.647
physics department at Harvard and also 
interested in Earth's upper atmospheric

04:26.167 --> 04:42.620
properties, became interested in planetary 
atmospheres early in his career by transitioning

04:26.167 --> 04:42.620
from the Earth's upper atmosphere to planetary 
atmospheres. And this was in the days before.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.180
well, 1968. It was in the days before much was known 
about abundances in planetary atmospheres. And

04:51.727 --> 05:02.505
in particular, the problem that he noticed was 
that the

04:51.727 --> 05:02.505
atmosphere of Mars was not well characterized. 
The pressures on Mars were postulated to be

05:04.962 --> 05:14.555
anywhere over a range of about 1,000 in surface 
pressure, and there just simply were no

05:04.962 --> 05:14.555
measurements that were highly reliable. And it 
was his thought, his idea, that this Pepsios

05:15.176 --> 05:31.898
interferometer could be used in the 
near-infrared, around 1 micron, to look at

05:15.176 --> 05:31.898
absorption lines of CO2 in the Martian 
atmosphere, and we could measure the abundance of

05:15.176 --> 05:31.898
CO2 that way. So while I was a graduate student, I 
came out here to the Smithsonian and helped set up

05:31.878 --> 05:42.409
and invent some of the materials for a pepsiose to 
be used in the near-infrared. And that experiment

05:43.330 --> 05:51.518
was set up at the Agassiz telescope, 61-inch 
telescope in Harvard, Mass. And the experiment

05:52.659 --> 05:57.764
was run simultaneously while I was a graduate 
student. We learned how to focus this thing in the

05:58.505 --> 06:01.648
infrared. and get it to measure the absorption 
lines on Mars. Who paid your bills at that time? Was

06:10.633 --> 06:11.474
it NASA? This was a NASA grant from, I think, yeah, 
from Planetary. I'd have to look back. Yeah, it was

06:20.602 --> 06:21.663
a bill. Bill Brunk was the person that we dealt with 
then, yeah, and for several years thereafter. Had

06:25.907 --> 06:30.471
Nat gotten this grant started before you came on 
board? It was about simultaneous. He got the money

06:33.863 --> 06:41.144
about the same time I came, and the grant was to pay 
for me to come here and to do this work, to buy the

06:33.863 --> 06:41.144
equipment. Yes? What about the, you mentioned the 
planetary atmospheres, not too much was known

06:43.343 --> 06:49.288
about them that you could really count on. Let's 
say the nose cone people, the reentry vehicle

06:49.368 --> 06:53.692
people could really take the hard stuff. Right, 
yeah. I mean, the issue here, excuse me, I should

06:54.053 --> 07:02.821
have said, the issue about Mars was a probe was to be 
sent there, and the question was, do you need a

06:54.053 --> 07:02.821
reentry vehicle? Could you use a parachute? How do 
you get something down to the surface of the

07:04.222 --> 07:06.384
planet? And so you wanted to know what the pressure 
was. That was the immediate practical problem. Go

07:09.887 --> 07:10.988
ahead, yeah. What about the state of the art of 
planetary astronomy in general when you came in?

07:16.289 --> 07:22.804
Was it pretty anti-Diluvian, pretty primitive 
compared to now? Well, there was a remarkable

07:23.947 --> 07:26.633
amount that was not known. I hadn't worked in 
planetary astronomy before this. physics

07:31.184 --> 07:34.067
laboratories doing atomic spectroscopy. And the 
sun was my major experience outside the

07:34.087 --> 07:39.073
laboratory. So I learned about planetary 
atmospheres. And so it didn't seem ancient to me or

07:42.857 --> 07:46.762
outmoded. It just seemed like what was. You always 
think that things are the way they are. You don't

07:50.867 --> 07:53.630
think, my god, why don't people know any better? 
These were hard experiments to do. And so to us, it

07:55.732 --> 08:00.938
was obvious then that nobody could have done a 
better experiment before. How many different

08:01.255 --> 08:06.003
major NASA contracts have you had? Not every year, 
but, you know, we worked on Pepsi Olsen, then we did

08:06.304 --> 08:12.956
this and stuff like that. Oh, a few, maybe

08:13.417 --> 08:20.850
four or five. The major ones that I remember are 
that we worked on this one grant, which extended

08:21.202 --> 08:31.355
for six, seven years, something like that, to work 
on planetary atmospheres. And we worked on many,

08:31.415 --> 08:40.908
many different aspects of planetary atmospheres 
and branched out and did things like interstellar

08:31.415 --> 08:40.908
lines and a lot of other stuff from that base. And 
actually, my planetary experience extends

08:42.089 --> 08:48.778
from... The first published paper was in 72, and 
the last one really was in 79. So that was the period

08:55.230 --> 08:59.882
in which we were using that grant to work. And after 
that, I became more interested in infrared and

09:00.464 --> 09:05.637
other things, and I started Working with other 
NASA grants for other purposes. Run out of

09:10.210 --> 09:10.931
planets? There's plenty of stars. Well, 
actually, I moved from doing that to doing far

09:12.934 --> 09:19.906
infrared spectroscopy with a Fourier transform 
spectrometer. And part of the reason, well, this

09:20.628 --> 09:26.618
is getting ahead of the story, but we went to Bill 
Brunk. I mean, that was the start of my independent

09:27.499 --> 09:31.506
research work. noticed that there was a lack of 
measurement in the far infrared, around 100

09:31.840 --> 09:42.049
micron wavelength, because that part of the 
atmosphere is totally absorbing due to water

09:31.840 --> 09:42.049
vapor, rotational absorptions. And there was, at 
the time, here at the Smithsonian, a dramatic

09:42.910 --> 09:50.717
experiment that Giovanni Fazio had been running 
for a few years. This was a one-meter diameter

09:51.137 --> 10:01.206
telescope that was carried to about 28 kilometers 
altitude by large balloons, helium-filled

09:51.137 --> 10:01.206
balloons from Palestine, Texas. And the thought 
here was, gee, why don't we build an instrument to

10:01.186 --> 10:09.338
look at spectral lines? Because all that was being 
done then was filters, broadband photometric

10:09.438 --> 10:18.491
measurements of planets, among other things, 
too. Outer planets we looked at with that

10:19.253 --> 10:20.915
instrument. But I was interested in looking at the 
spectra. And so we proposed to the Planetary

10:24.380 --> 10:29.067
Division, to Bill Brunk, in fact, to build an FTS to 
go onto this instrument. And one of the things, we

10:35.039 --> 10:46.233
had a number of things that were of interest, but 
one of the things was to look at the atmospheres of

10:35.039 --> 10:46.233
Venus and Mars and see there was a whole number of 
rotational lines in the far infrared that we

10:35.039 --> 10:46.233
should be able to see there. We did receive the 
money. I received the grant, $150,000 to build

10:48.936 --> 10:52.040
this instrument. And we built it and flew it. It 
turned out to be a very difficult thing to do to

10:56.755 --> 11:00.700
point this telescope accurately. And so, in fact, 
we never ever did use it to record any planetary

11:00.800 --> 11:05.926
spectra. But we went on to look at the Earth's 
atmosphere. And my career on atmospheres has

11:10.571 --> 11:16.679
evolved into the Earth's atmosphere then. And 
we've done a lot of work since then on the

11:16.699 --> 11:19.762
terrestrial atmosphere. But that's not planets. 
That's the Earth. Oh, may I continue on this? Yeah,

11:28.274 --> 11:38.294
it just occurred to me that as an interesting 
sidelight, my interest in planets has followed my

11:28.274 --> 11:38.294
other interests, which are spectroscopy, but 
really interferometry. I just am fascinated by

11:38.454 --> 11:41.761
the idea of interfering beams of light. And 
another experiment that I've worked on for the

11:42.442 --> 11:47.552
last decade is using high angular resolution 
separated telescopes to look at stars and

11:47.752 --> 11:58.888
materials around stars perhaps. And so an 
instrument that we have now built on Mount Hopkins

11:59.488 --> 12:11.245
uses telescopes that are separated by up to about 
38 meters to do a modern Michelson stellar

11:59.488 --> 12:11.245
interferometer type experiment. And one of the 
things that we've been looking at recently is, can

12:11.225 --> 12:24.200
this instrument detect planets around other 
stars by looking at the very small wobble that you

12:11.225 --> 12:24.200
would see in the position of the star as it moves 
across the sky? It's an incredibly difficult

12:24.881 --> 12:35.274
problem, but it comes back to searching for 
planets instead of looking at ones that you know,

12:24.881 --> 12:35.274
and that kind of amuses me. What wavelength is the 
uranoprometer after wavelengths? The one at

12:38.512 --> 12:40.595
Mount Hopkins. The Mount Hopkins instrument. 
This would be a visible and near-infrared

12:41.898 --> 12:47.947
instrument, visible and K-band instrument. How 
was your relationship with NASA when they were

12:49.290 --> 12:53.597
funding? Who's funding you now, by the way, NSF or? 
We have a little money through the University of

12:56.942 --> 13:03.152
Wyoming from the NSF for this project. 
interferometer project, which is called IOTA for

13:04.060 --> 13:09.607
Infrared Optical Telescope Array on Mount 
Hopkins. And there is some other funding for that

13:10.609 --> 13:19.661
project from NASA also, and internally from the 
Smithsonian. But the bulk of my funding is for

13:20.983 --> 13:29.334
looking at the Earth's atmosphere, because I run 
these two sorts of projects parallel, or run with

13:20.983 --> 13:29.334
them. And the bulk of the funding is from the upper 
atmospheric division at NASA to look at the

13:32.090 --> 13:36.116
Earth's atmosphere.

13:39.442 --> 13:43.408
How would you say NASA does when they're giving you 
money? Do they butt in? Are they getting worse? Are

13:45.271 --> 13:46.072
they getting better? Do they generally let you do 
what you said you were going to do, or what? Feel

13:52.141 --> 13:53.203
free. No, I have nothing but happiness to report on 
that. I mean, every experiment that I've been

13:57.047 --> 14:06.020
involved with in the planetary division and in the 
upper atmospheric division, we've proposed to do

13:57.047 --> 14:06.020
work. NASA has almost always given us essentially 
all of the money that we've asked for. I can't

14:12.650 --> 14:18.638
recall a single case where somebody has come and 
said, you ought to be doing this and not that. And on

14:19.219 --> 14:22.684
top of that, after you do the work, I haven't, 
nobody's ever come back and said, well, you

14:23.238 --> 14:36.495
promised to do X, Y, and Z, but you only did X and half 
of Y because, you know, you always end up sort of

14:23.238 --> 14:36.495
thinking you can do more than you actually do, and 
sometimes you do things that you never thought you

14:23.238 --> 14:36.495
would do. So it always amazes me that people never 
come along and inventory what you put in your first

14:36.535 --> 14:44.625
proposal and see whether or not that's what you 
actually reported three years later. It's

14:44.685 --> 14:47.329
astonishing. I hope they don't start doing it. 
There was a comment that I read somewhere that...

14:53.140 --> 15:00.761
By definition, of course, discoveries cannot be 
foreseen because someone had been accused by some

14:53.140 --> 15:00.761
government agency of not foreseeing this 
discovery. Yes, of course, that's ridiculous.

15:05.493 --> 15:10.240
You know, some people object to having to write 
proposals and say, oh, well, this is a lot of busy

15:05.493 --> 15:10.240
work. I think it's a good idea because it helps you 
clearly formulate your ideas. You think of things

15:14.987 --> 15:19.674
that you might not have thought about when you're 
forced to write it down and defend it in front of

15:14.987 --> 15:19.674
people. And so I don't have any problem with that. 
What do you consider the most important piece of

15:26.465 --> 15:33.475
work you've done in planetary astronomy?

15:37.083 --> 15:42.689
Oh, there are several things that really excited 
me when I looked at them. The first experiment I did

15:45.452 --> 15:51.298
was to discover oxygen on Mars. And this was a big 
thrill because I'd only discovered one other

15:51.519 --> 15:59.187
thing once before in a laboratory setting. And to 
go out and actually look through a telescope and

15:59.287 --> 16:04.913
discover a molecule that nobody had ever seen 
before was really a very exciting thing for me. And

16:08.772 --> 16:12.218
that was 1972 we published that. That was a 
follow-up of the work that had been done on CO2 on

16:13.140 --> 16:16.585
Mars. And so I always remember that fondly, 
perhaps because it was the first thing. I don't

16:22.035 --> 16:25.620
know if it was the most important, but it certainly 
was fun for me. Okay, that was my next question,

16:26.041 --> 16:28.786
what was the most fun, and you just answered it. Did 
you ever... run into any real bogs or morasses or

16:31.657 --> 16:40.791
blind alleys or things where you said, oh, we never 
should have tried this or something like that?

16:40.811 --> 16:54.593
Well, there was a whole body of work that we did on 
looking at Jupiter and Saturn in lines of methane,

16:40.811 --> 16:54.593
ammonia, methane and ammonia, and hydrogen lines 
also. And I guess I have a regret. I mean, it was a

16:57.899 --> 17:04.593
morass in the sense that we took a ton of data on 
spectral lines that were not well characterized.

17:04.654 --> 17:08.281
We didn't know what the temperature dependence of 
their oscillator strengths was. But we did it in

17:09.243 --> 17:14.134
the hope that these things would be learned later. 
Nat Carlton and I spent many, many, many nights at

17:14.300 --> 17:34.385
the 60-inch telescope on Mount Hopkins that he 
actually built, and I helped him with a little bit

17:14.300 --> 17:34.385
in those days, taking data on these outer planets 
that never really ended up being digested and

17:14.300 --> 17:34.385
published in the kind of form that I would have been 
happy with. There are a few reports out, but we saw a

17:34.806 --> 17:43.176
lot of things, like ammonia coming and going, and 
many, many things that never really quite got

17:43.713 --> 17:45.495
tidied up the way they should have been and 
published. How have NASA's dollars affected

17:47.757 --> 17:56.647
planetary astronomy

17:47.757 --> 17:56.647
in general? Well, I'm not sure how to answer that, 
because I actually... Where would we be without

17:56.667 --> 18:01.892
it? Oh, well, unquestionably, none of this stuff 
would ever have been done at this level if there

18:03.013 --> 18:11.442
wasn't funding from NASA to do it. I mean, I would 
have gone off to work for IBM or something like

18:12.063 --> 18:15.086
that. Well, in fact, that was my other promising 
offer. Instead of coming to a much lower-paying

18:20.431 --> 18:27.237
job here at the Smithsonian, doing something that 
sounded like a lot of fun. So if it were not for the

18:28.418 --> 18:34.945
NASA support, we would know none of this stuff, I 
think, now. Back when you started, were you aware

18:36.906 --> 18:39.589
of any... snobbishness on the part of quote real 
unquote astronomers towards people who worked on

18:40.548 --> 19:07.602
the planets oh well yes uh i mean i i'm even more 
aware of uh of this well we were talking about

18:40.548 --> 19:07.602
second class status for planetary astronomers 
you said you were even more aware of that well well

18:40.548 --> 19:07.602
the thing is i i was a physicist i am a physicist and i 
came from the physics department and I learned a

19:07.919 --> 19:14.946
little astronomy by going up and taking a few 
courses and reading books, but I wasn't a real

19:07.919 --> 19:14.946
astronomer. And there are real astronomers and 
there are outsiders. So I'm perfectly aware of the

19:17.989 --> 19:28.360
fact that real astronomers are different than 
people who get into the field by some other back

19:17.989 --> 19:28.360
door, like studying physics. And planetary 
astronomy is one of those outside of real

19:33.316 --> 19:35.920
astronomy areas also. But at the Smithsonian 
here, we're all coexisting quite happily, and

19:36.641 --> 19:44.392
I've never really had any problems with it. I enjoy 
what I'm doing, and other people, I think, respect

19:44.913 --> 19:48.338
what we're doing. Do you think over the last 30 
years or so that the planetary astronomers have

19:48.919 --> 19:58.172
managed to get up to about equal status with the 
stellar and galactic people? Well, it... No, I

20:02.071 --> 20:03.974
don't think that that's ever the case. I mean, if 
you study galaxies and what the distribution of

20:04.075 --> 20:20.383
galaxies is, like some of the people in this 
building do, you will always attract much more

20:04.075 --> 20:20.383
attention and be considered to be a real 
astronomer by the general public than if you study

20:04.075 --> 20:20.383
planets. I think there's certainly such a great 
interest in the part of the general public in

20:20.363 --> 20:36.006
planets because that's where people live and 
there might be life that this is, you know, one

20:20.363 --> 20:36.006
doesn't feel like, I don't feel like a second class 
citizen having done this sort of thing. Do you

20:36.026 --> 20:40.633
think planetary astronomers have done a good job 
publicizing themselves to the general public?

20:42.925 --> 20:49.553
I think that the best publicist in the world for 
astronomy was a planetary astronomer. Carl

20:49.613 --> 21:00.245
Sagan, in my opinion, did a wonderful job 
publicizing the adventure of astronomy and, of

20:49.613 --> 21:00.245
course, of planetary astronomy and science in 
general. I don't think he's appreciated by a lot of

21:01.306 --> 21:08.595
other astronomers or maybe even planetary 
astronomers.

21:09.622 --> 21:27.226
I think that Carl has done a wonderful job and that 
people really appreciate and enjoy his programs a

21:09.622 --> 21:27.226
lot and that he brought a lot of people very close to 
being interested in what goes on at telescopes and

21:09.622 --> 21:27.226
the interpretation of the results from 
telescopes. I think he's done a very good job for

21:27.607 --> 21:28.929
it.

21:32.153 --> 21:33.755
That's a very general question. Do you think that 
all the new results that have come out on solar

21:37.803 --> 21:45.834
system objects in the last 30 years have affected 
the public's ideas to any extent? Talking about

21:46.155 --> 21:51.642
the public that reads, for

21:46.155 --> 21:51.642
example. Well, I mean, yes. I mean, it helps by 
knowing more about, well, by knowing, for

21:53.344 --> 22:06.122
example, that there's not life on Mars, but that we 
have looked and that there was a possibility and,

21:53.344 --> 22:06.122
well, it didn't pan out. and just the general 
intellectual excitement of thinking about

22:06.355 --> 22:10.922
something that's nearby. I think people don't 
relate to stars. My personal opinion, the general

22:14.688 --> 22:18.855
public doesn't relate to things that are far away. 
They always want to know, well, how does this

22:19.255 --> 22:21.499
affect me? If you tell them what you do and that you 
study astronomy or planets, they say eventually

22:21.539 --> 22:33.898
their question is, aside from polite

22:21.539 --> 22:33.898
questions, A lot of people, the bulk of people in 
the United States say, well, really, how does this

22:34.115 --> 22:39.863
affect me and why should I be supporting it? That's 
what they think deep down inside. And if it's

22:42.146 --> 22:48.895
something that can relate to a person, like 
searching for life or looking at other planetary

22:42.146 --> 22:48.895
surfaces that are like the Earth. Or deflecting 
killer asteroids. Or deflecting killer

22:50.497 --> 22:51.919
asteroids. Or preventing the ozone hole from 
growing or the greenhouse. Well, yes. Now, that's

22:56.565 --> 22:59.008
something that comes incredibly close to home. 
Well, it used to be that people would talk about, or

22:58.988 --> 23:15.302
I would say things like, it's of interest to study 
other planets, like Venus and Mars, because they

22:58.988 --> 23:15.302
tell you something about the Earth, because 
they're very similar, and that we ought to make

22:58.988 --> 23:15.302
these comparative studies. And those are sort of 
vague, generalized arguments that I don't think

23:16.043 --> 23:21.348
the general public would buy. But if you discover 
all of a sudden that the ozone is disappearing over

23:21.828 --> 23:28.354
the South Pole, and that it might very well start 
disappearing over the North Pole, by the year

23:28.334 --> 23:49.583
2000, and that this work has been done by people who 
really were all planetary astronomers, well,

23:28.334 --> 23:49.583
almost all planetary astronomers at one time in 
their life, then maybe the virtue of what people

23:28.334 --> 23:49.583
had said before, that you should study these other 
systems, starts to come home.

23:50.288 --> 23:51.309
Personal question here. Now, I can recall you and 
Matt and you and I and Andy and all these fights

23:51.349 --> 23:59.961
about your Pepsios data. What ever went on with all 
that? Well, the key thing that sticks in my mind

24:03.987 --> 24:11.858
about Pepsios is that we did a a mind-stretching 
experiment with it, which was to measure wind

24:12.783 --> 24:17.628
velocities on Venus. This was a suggestion that 
was brought to us by Mike Belton one time when Mike

24:18.349 --> 24:28.400
and Don Hunton came up to visit the Pepsios on Mount 
Hopkins. And they looked at this wonderful

24:28.941 --> 24:33.866
instrument and said, gee, you can measure wind 
velocities on Venus. And we said, oh, we can? We had

24:35.728 --> 24:39.432
been looking at carbon dioxide lines in the upper 
atmosphere of Venus cloud tops. And then we

24:42.356 --> 24:45.327
realized that, yes, of course they're bright. 
This is a wonderful experiment. And Nat and I

24:46.733 --> 24:50.046
worked on this for several years. We worked very 
hard to try and make sure that there were not any

24:50.768 --> 25:05.230
instrumental biases, because what we were 
looking for was a very tiny shift in the wavelength

24:50.768 --> 25:05.230
of a spectral line formed in the atmosphere of 
Venus from sunlight. The sunlight bounced off the

25:05.250 --> 25:07.974
top of the atmosphere of Venus. Some of it was 
absorbed in a CO2 line. And if the atmosphere was

25:10.478 --> 25:20.633
moving, if there were winds or velocities from 
mass motions in the atmosphere, you would see a

25:10.478 --> 25:20.633
small Doppler shift. The Doppler shift would 
translate into a wavelength shift that you could

25:20.653 --> 25:23.898
measure on Earth. So we measured Doppler shifts of 
these spectral lines at various places on the

25:24.899 --> 25:39.000
planet so that you could compare the light that you 
saw reflected from the limb with the light

25:24.899 --> 25:39.000
reflected from the terminator and see if there was 
a wavelength shift. And if there was a wavelength

25:39.166 --> 25:43.651
shift, you could attribute that to a rotational 
velocity of the upper atmosphere. And we observed

25:44.712 --> 26:00.750
this for several years when Venus was on different 
sides of the sun, in different configurations,

25:44.712 --> 26:00.750
under different circumstances, and measured 
what I am convinced is a very good measurement of

25:44.712 --> 26:00.750
100 meter per second winds in the upper atmosphere 
of Venus. And we published that paper. There

26:05.416 --> 26:06.557
was... Well, this is not my favorite story, but 
there was skepticism, mostly, from our good

26:07.617 --> 26:30.057
friend Andy Young, who took it upon himself to 
decide that there were a lot of instrumental

26:07.617 --> 26:30.057
effects in this complicated instrument that 
could have caused these winds to appear to be

26:07.617 --> 26:30.057
shifting when, in fact, they weren't. I thought 
that I had taken out all of these effects by

26:31.759 --> 26:36.223
calibration and repeated measurements uh... and 
uh... was convinced that he was wrong but we

26:36.490 --> 27:04.540
invited him up and he came up and worked on the 
mountain top with us for a week or so one time the

26:36.490 --> 27:04.540
results unfortunately were inconclusive we were 
not able to make experiments which showed that the

26:36.490 --> 27:04.540
instrument did have biases in it but we certainly 
were able to make the instrument produce biased

26:36.490 --> 27:04.540
results by pushing hard enough which i knew that 
you could do these were not the circumstances

26:36.490 --> 27:04.540
under which the wind velocities were measured The 
outcome of that was, I believe, that... And this

27:05.819 --> 27:26.708
I'm not sure about because I don't have it 
documented, but I do believe that Andy spoke

27:05.819 --> 27:26.708
against these results to a number of people and 
said they can't possibly be measuring wind

27:05.819 --> 27:26.708
velocities there. This is a figment of their 
imagination or whatever. The instrument is full

27:29.672 --> 27:31.134
of biases. And... essentially caused these 
results not to be widely quoted. I still, to this

27:42.929 --> 27:56.194
day, am absolutely convinced that we did take out 
the biases and that we could see these effects and

27:42.929 --> 27:56.194
that we did measure 100 meter per second winds and 
that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the

27:42.929 --> 27:56.194
measurements. But I think it's a very unfortunate 
thing. Well, for me at least, it's personally

27:59.172 --> 28:09.747
unfortunate that Andy felt so strongly about this 
that he went around and told people that these

27:59.172 --> 28:09.747
results were suspect. And in fact, I remember 
clearly from one committee meeting that was held

28:09.767 --> 28:25.168
to try and summarize the results of the Venus upper 
atmosphere, I had a call one day from somebody who

28:09.767 --> 28:25.168
was responsible for writing up these results. 
uh... results uh... jerry schubert and uh... he

28:25.705 --> 28:51.595
said you know that you know we're not gonna mention 
these results because uh... we think that they

28:25.705 --> 28:51.595
were contaminated or flawed or something like 
that and it was a result of uh... andy's lobbying i

28:25.705 --> 28:51.595
believe i i said the same thing to him but uh... you 
know i uh... what can you do you published your

28:25.705 --> 28:51.595
results so that people could then take a crack at 
them But the results were never critiqued in a

28:53.077 --> 28:58.588
published paper. There is absolutely no 
publication that I'm aware of that said, look, if

28:59.911 --> 29:10.292
you interpret the results this way or that way, 
they turn out to be wrong.

29:11.639 --> 29:18.290
I'm going to consider you still a planetary 
astronomer because you are looking at the

29:11.639 --> 29:18.290
atmosphere of a planet, although we happen to live 
on it. But still, I always print Earth with a

29:18.330 --> 29:25.723
capital E, not a small e, because it's like Mars. 
How would you describe the current state of

29:26.804 --> 29:29.329
planetary astronomy? Growing, shrinking, 
hanging in there, whatever? You mean including

29:33.560 --> 29:35.502
the Earth or not including the Earth? Both ways. If 
you include the Earth, planetary astronomy is

29:36.543 --> 29:45.493
doing wonderfully because there's a lot of effort 
and interest in trying to find out what's going on

29:36.543 --> 29:45.493
with the Earth's atmosphere. If you exclude the 
Earth, I think there's a terrible problem.

29:51.359 --> 29:54.323
There's very little going on in planetary 
astronomy that I'm aware of. They're shutting off

29:54.723 --> 29:58.487
the Venus.

29:58.687 --> 30:07.835
surface Venus radar machine, and the only 
instrument that's going to be built now is going

29:58.687 --> 30:07.835
out to Pluto, which barely qualifies as a planet. 
But as far as the Earth is concerned, the state of

30:09.297 --> 30:19.886
research is very exciting because we have these 
two problems that are clearly in the public mind.

30:20.166 --> 30:28.474
One is of the buildup of carbon dioxide and the 
increasing temperature of the Earth, which has

30:20.166 --> 30:28.474
been advocated and promoted most strongly by a 
former planetary person, Jim Hansen, at Goddard,

30:29.028 --> 30:38.204
whatever it is in New York City. It's Goddard in New 
York. And I happen to think Jim is right. I remember

30:45.317 --> 30:53.652
Jim's original work in looking at the atmosphere 
of Venus and discovering from inverting

30:54.290 --> 31:06.904
calculations that the particles in the 
stratosphere of Venus had to be spherical globs

30:54.290 --> 31:06.904
with an index of refraction of one point 
something, something, something, which was an

30:54.290 --> 31:06.904
absolute. Or three. You know this problem, too. 
And just to diverge for a second, I remember this

31:09.987 --> 31:13.871
result so clearly. I thought, this is 
astonishing. How could he possibly say that

31:15.092 --> 31:18.256
nothing in nature is ideal like that? That's a 
physicist idealization. But he said that this is

31:20.648 --> 31:22.251
really the way it was. And I remember we had a 
graduate student. And I put the graduate student

31:25.255 --> 31:30.003
to this problem of saying, look, here's the 
handbook of chemistry and physics. Why don't you

31:30.083 --> 31:35.872
look up all the substances that have index of 
refraction in this range and see what that could

31:30.083 --> 31:35.872
possibly be? And the student came back and he said, 
well, there's sulfuric acid and there's other

31:36.613 --> 31:40.840
stuff. And we sort of chuckled and said, well, 
obviously, Very uninformed comment of ours.

31:45.974 --> 31:51.380
Obviously, these clouds could not be made out of 
sulfuric acid particles, and sort of dropped it at

31:45.974 --> 31:51.380
that point. And months and a year later, this was 
really taken up seriously. I guess that was Louise

31:57.667 --> 31:59.870
Young that came up with that. Louise Young 
commented on it. Jeffrey Sill, you were involved,

32:03.694 --> 32:06.997
I think. Yeah, yeah. And so a number of people came 
up with it, but it was... It was a major failure on my

32:12.522 --> 32:20.940
part not to follow that up vigorously after that 
because it was a very interesting result.

32:24.328 --> 32:27.154
What influence has the private sector had on 
planetary astronomy? Well, we actually... have

32:31.355 --> 32:38.908
been funded by private companies to do some 
research, in particular on the Earth's

32:31.355 --> 32:38.908
atmosphere. In this case, this was after I had 
switched from looking at planets to looking at the

32:39.889 --> 32:46.220
Earth's atmosphere. But if you count the Earth 
then, the Chemical Manufacturers Association in

32:46.280 --> 32:54.814
the early 80s funded us for a number of years in 
parallel with NASA to augment our NASA funding,

32:55.267 --> 33:13.593
which was not quite enough to do what we would like 
to have done, to look at problems in the

32:55.267 --> 33:13.593
stratosphere of the Earth that were basically 
things that resulted from chemicals that would be

32:55.267 --> 33:13.593
put into the Earth. This was in the early days of 
realizing that it was before there was an ozone

33:13.613 --> 33:20.262
problem, quite clearly. there were issues of 
looking at hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric

33:20.714 --> 33:35.500
acid, and other things that are, well, 
hydrochloric acid, the HCL, is generated mostly

33:20.714 --> 33:35.500
by freons that come from the chemicals that are 
manufactured by, manufactured for aerosol use.

33:38.841 --> 33:45.009
And we had a good relationship with the CMA in 
sponsoring some of our research. And again, just

33:45.750 --> 33:59.466
as with NASA, they gave us the money, we did the work 
that we promised to do, but they never came back and

33:45.750 --> 33:59.466
insisted that we do something different or 
insisted on reviewing our results before they

33:45.750 --> 33:59.466
were published. They were quite even-handed and 
scholarly about it. So we did have some private

34:05.292 --> 34:08.617
research funding, interestingly. Did you ever 
have any funding from the Department of Defense?

34:14.225 --> 34:15.547
Not for doing, no. We had no Defense Department 
funding for doing planetary work. To switch to a

34:21.235 --> 34:32.250
different topic,

34:21.235 --> 34:32.250
there was quite a bit of thought 20 years ago as to 
whether there ought to be a separate planetary sub

34:33.175 --> 34:35.225
in the American Astronomical Society. Now, of 
course, there is a division for planetary

34:35.265 --> 34:38.681
studies. Do you think that was a good idea? Oh, I 
think it's an excellent idea to have the planetary

34:43.115 --> 34:58.973
division, because if you look at the meeting, look 
at the abstracts for the meetings, they have grown

34:43.115 --> 34:58.973
enormously over the years, and there's a lot of 
really interesting material. Unfortunately, I

35:00.215 --> 35:05.581
haven't been to a DPS meeting for maybe 10 years. Do 
you think that the majority of planetary

35:06.802 --> 35:12.649
astronomers are putting it the other way, the How 
much connection is there between people who work

35:13.709 --> 35:19.975
on the planets and people who work on stars and 
galaxies? For example, here at CFA. Oh, how much

35:24.399 --> 35:26.100
connection is there? I mean, how do people know 
what the other people are doing? Oh. Or do they

35:31.986 --> 35:34.988
care? Very little, I would say. Very little. Yeah. 
I think that that's,

35:37.351 --> 35:42.315
I mean, people are, I don't think that there's a 
whole lot of cross-fertilization or

35:44.489 --> 35:50.476
cross-interest, really. I wanted to ask you about 
Icarus. Icarus is now the premier journal for

35:54.820 --> 36:01.387
planetary astronomy. And 20 or 30 years ago, it was 
distinctly second class. How do you think it rates

36:05.592 --> 36:08.455
now against the FJ?

36:10.983 --> 36:24.358
Well, Icarus certainly is a much larger and, I 
guess I would say, more carefully refereed and

36:10.983 --> 36:24.358
believable journal than it used to be. The APJ, of 
course, has an incredibly high standard.

36:32.767 --> 36:36.872
So I think it's getting up close there. But in the 
early days, when a lot of not a lot was, well, it's

36:37.814 --> 36:45.141
surprising because, I mean, there's always not a 
lot known about stars. There's also not a lot known

36:45.161 --> 36:47.323
about planets. But a lot of the planetary papers, I 
think, were very speculative. And so they weren't

36:52.047 --> 36:54.949
considered to be solid science. But if you think 
about it, a lot of the papers on stars and galaxies

36:55.070 --> 37:00.755
are equally speculative or more so. Or cosmology. 
But they're printed in a format that makes them

37:01.996 --> 37:07.821
look very so-called scientific, I suppose. Do you 
think the idea of having a journal like Icarus is a

37:07.801 --> 37:11.926
good one? Oh, absolutely. I mean, a specialized 
journal, well, it's hardly even specialized, but

37:13.948 --> 37:26.802
a journal where you can go and find things that are 
relevant to a field or you can pick it up and you can

37:13.948 --> 37:26.802
say, okay, I want to know what's going on in 
planetary astronomy these days. You know where to

37:27.122 --> 37:29.205
go and pick it up and leaf through it. I don't think 
there's hardly any. I can't remember the last

37:30.906 --> 37:35.952
article that I saw in the AppJ that was a planetary 
journal. We've published planetary articles in

37:36.623 --> 37:42.150
the AppJ, but I don't know if anybody ever read 
them. It is a self-evident fact that radio

37:43.592 --> 37:53.746
astronomers are a less stuffy bunch than optical 
astronomers, and they have their own poker game

37:43.592 --> 37:53.746
that AAS means and all that sort of stuff. Do you 
think that planetary astronomers, as a group, are

37:53.766 --> 38:00.775
less pompous and stuffy than stellar and galactic 
and cosmological astronomers?

38:03.117 --> 38:04.823
Oh, I can't answer a question like that. I have many 
friends in both areas. I don't think that any of

38:07.813 --> 38:11.406
them are really particularly stuffy.
