WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:16.201
How to get these youngsters to study properly, the percent of A's and B's in that class, total A's and B's went up to around 70%.

00:16.441 --> 00:32.417
There were some kids, no matter what I did, that didn't seem to do any good, but the majority of them got the message, and then they found out an interesting thing.

00:34.355 --> 00:42.911
People over that were on the admissions committee in the College of Veterinary Medicine were good friends of mine.

00:42.932 --> 00:52.009
And I was told by the chairman of that committee one day that we don't care much what

00:52.546 --> 01:01.739
grades these kids who are applying to vet school has if they can make an A or a B in your course, almost guaranteed admission.

01:02.881 --> 01:09.651
And these kids recognized, gee, if we can make a B in this course, we can probably get in vet school.

01:10.192 --> 01:11.193
And they went to work.

01:12.435 --> 01:15.579
And the last five years was really a fun time.

01:16.160 --> 01:20.106
Which of all the courses you taught, which one did you enjoy most?

01:23.039 --> 01:27.066
That's a tough question to answer.

01:29.250 --> 01:38.185
I'm an organic chemist and any organic chemistry absolutely fascinates me, whether it's an undergraduate or graduate organic course.

01:39.948 --> 01:43.073
But I like other

01:43.677 --> 01:44.878
Types of chemistry too.

01:44.999 --> 01:46.440
I like freshman chemistry.

01:47.161 --> 01:57.954
It was a frustrating course back in the days when I taught it because we didn't have good students and the core was just causing all kinds of troubles.

02:02.839 --> 02:03.300
Let's see.

02:03.340 --> 02:07.285
Somewhere I remember you invented skunk oil.

02:08.366 --> 02:09.347
Is that what you called it?

02:09.918 --> 02:12.722
Yeah, it's synthetic skunk scent is what it is.

02:12.802 --> 02:13.964
How did you find that out?

02:14.245 --> 02:19.333
Oh, I remember how and when did you develop that?

02:20.034 --> 02:23.739
Well, I have this ranch out at Bernie.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.741
I say I have it.

02:24.861 --> 02:26.343
It doesn't belong to me at all.

02:27.585 --> 02:38.322
My wife had an uncle and aunt who owned this place, and they used to invite us out there every Thanksgiving because I enjoyed hunting.

02:38.791 --> 02:43.723
And her uncle was one of the strangest boys I've ever seen.

02:43.743 --> 02:49.436
And he didn't like just a lot of people, but he loved Edith.

02:49.857 --> 02:54.147
And she was his niece by marriage.

02:54.668 --> 02:57.154
His wife was Edith's.

02:57.472 --> 03:03.649
dead sister, so they were no blood kin, but Robert Raglin was his name.

03:04.391 --> 03:12.493
His wife had a sudden heart attack out there, and they had no children.

03:12.473 --> 03:14.917
That really hurt him badly.

03:16.140 --> 03:22.331
Then he came down with lung cancer because he was a chain smoker.

03:23.573 --> 03:29.824
We went out there one day, the last time we saw him out there at the ranch,

03:29.804 --> 03:50.305
pretty sick, and he said, I've got the well all fixed up, I've got everything else working fine, and I want you to have the place.

03:50.365 --> 03:53.228
When did you start working on the skunk oil?

03:53.248 --> 03:56.892
Well, coming up to that.

03:57.091 --> 03:59.979
Now he worked out some sort of a deal.

04:01.002 --> 04:03.689
She paid him a dollar or something like that, you know.

04:04.130 --> 04:13.075
I'm not sure it was legal, but he said if the IRS doesn't contact you in five years, you've got it made and nothing happened.

04:13.561 --> 04:20.471
So it's all needed to her, and I kid her every now and then, I don't own a single acre of it.

04:23.515 --> 04:28.422
But it's full of white-tailed deer and all kinds of other animals.

04:29.363 --> 04:39.357
And so a friend of mine, a bow hunter friend of mine, came to me one day and said, Tex, know you like to hunt.

04:39.377 --> 04:41.560
I'll tell you how to really be a better hunter.

04:42.569 --> 04:44.051
And I said, how you do it?

04:44.292 --> 05:01.016
And I said, you just go out and drive up and down country roads and find dead skunks and take this vile-smelling juice out of their anal gland and bottle it up and put it downwind of you when you go hunting.

05:01.637 --> 05:05.402
And you won't have to smell it when it's downwind of you, always.

05:06.003 --> 05:09.268
But any of your odor that goes through that

05:09.890 --> 05:21.306
It has some sort of a strange ability to prevent any wild animal that uses nose to detect human odors.

05:21.807 --> 05:24.070
They cannot detect human odors anymore.

05:25.452 --> 05:27.114
And I said, oh, you gotta be kidding.

05:27.134 --> 05:29.017
And he said, no, I'm not.

05:29.117 --> 05:33.383
And so I bought a, you could buy

05:33.802 --> 05:58.122
this stuff bottled from one or two of these hunting stores in Texas and so I bought a little bottle and I decided that I was going to wait until the Christmas holidays when hopefully not many people would be in the chemistry building and I was going to run samples of this through a gas chromatograph and

05:58.422 --> 06:20.667
You can use this pretty well to, if you can run a synthetic sample through and compare it to the behavior of the natural material, and they seem to be identical, and it's more complicated than that, but basically you can pretty well prove their identity.

06:20.647 --> 06:23.370
Fortunately, I didn't have to do it.

06:24.011 --> 06:35.323
I picked up a chemical abstract one day, about in September, right after school started.

06:37.686 --> 06:47.076
Somebody had, everybody before that had thought that

06:47.680 --> 06:53.947
The chemical in skunk scent was a compound called amylmercaptan.

06:54.287 --> 07:00.054
Well, amylmercaptan happens to smell like skunk scent, but it isn't it.

07:00.194 --> 07:02.456
Butylmercaptan, excuse me, butylmercaptan.

07:02.476 --> 07:05.920
They put it in, mix it in natural gas.

07:06.260 --> 07:10.545
That's what you smell if you've got a natural gas leak.

07:11.506 --> 07:12.287
Well, it...

07:12.267 --> 07:36.047
It turns out that the old boy that claimed that that was Butylmer Captain in 1896 collected a volume of this stuff, did a distillation of all things, and did some chemical tests on it, and it had the right boiling point and gave some of the correct tests that Butylmer Captain

07:36.500 --> 07:38.542
gives, but isn't but butylmercaptan.

07:39.043 --> 07:49.434
And it's something called crotylmercaptan, which is the same molecule minus two hydrogen atoms.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.716
It has a carbon-to-carbon double bond in the middle.

07:52.277 --> 07:53.218
Smell identical.

07:53.498 --> 07:58.463
I defy any human nose to detect the difference.

07:58.483 --> 08:03.629
But anyway, I went into the laboratory and made up a bunch of butylmercaptan.

08:03.709 --> 08:04.870
I'd tried him.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.726
They built them a captain on my deer, and they'd run off every time they'd smell it.

08:09.708 --> 08:16.741
And I took some of this out there, and this animal was a captain, turned some loose, and I was sitting on a little hill.

08:18.303 --> 08:24.875
And I looked over in just a few minutes, and I wasn't covered with anything, no brush around me.

08:24.895 --> 08:28.561
Here came a doe, walked right out of the woods, and I think she was curious.

08:28.581 --> 08:30.064
She smelled this odor, I think.

08:30.736 --> 08:44.398
And she walked right up within about 20 yards of me and then walked all the way around me very slowly watching me all the time and then turned around and kind of shook her head and walked back into the woods.

08:45.539 --> 08:48.524
And I knew that no deer.

08:48.744 --> 08:50.547
What year was this about?

08:51.008 --> 08:56.136
Well, this would have to be, let's see,

09:02.157 --> 09:17.010
This would have to be around the early, late 50s, early 60s.

09:17.331 --> 09:25.598
And I knew that no animal, no deer would ever do a thing like that.

09:26.299 --> 09:30.503
I did lots of other tests on it, and it's incredible.

09:30.543 --> 09:32.164
I've had deer walk

09:32.701 --> 09:37.243
I shot a deer one day that I could almost hit with the end of my gun.

09:38.253 --> 09:44.860
He walked right up to me, and this material was out, and he never did figure it out.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.843
When did you begin to produce it and sell it commercially?

09:47.863 --> 09:51.887
When I retired, I thought, well, it'd be fun.

09:52.007 --> 09:57.233
Yeah, maybe somebody, this stuff is good enough, somebody would buy it because it's easy to handle.

09:57.673 --> 10:00.656
The natural stuff, God, you can't get near it.

10:01.637 --> 10:05.121
This stuff comes in two bottles, and they have...

10:05.101 --> 10:14.901
The two solutions are both water solutions, and they have virtually no odor, but when you mix them, there's a chemical reaction that produces the final crotone or captain.

10:15.321 --> 10:25.101
So you can create your odor anywhere you want to, and as long as you keep these bottles apart, you're not going to get into any trouble yourself.

10:25.672 --> 10:40.971
And so Edith and I talked about maybe mixing some up in our garage and running an ad in the Houston Post and seeing if anybody would buy the stuff.

10:41.032 --> 10:46.458
And then it suddenly occurred to me, the Houston Post sells a million people buying its paper.

10:47.700 --> 10:55.510
I could get so much business that I wouldn't know how to handle it.

10:56.148 --> 11:07.629
So there was a little company here in College Station, named the Miler Company, and they talked me into producing it and selling it for me.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.714
And they turned out, did you know,

11:14.018 --> 11:20.264
This guy was an associate dean of engineering, and you have probablyâ€” Not Skip Porter.

11:20.585 --> 11:20.945
No.

11:21.626 --> 11:26.290
He was in the Department of Aeronautical Engineering.

11:26.330 --> 11:33.377
He was dean, associate dean, and thought he was an honest guy.

11:33.437 --> 11:34.959
They were dishonest as they could be.

11:35.379 --> 11:36.200
Uh-oh.

11:36.220 --> 11:41.005
And they set up an operation designed to never make a profit.

11:42.520 --> 11:43.842
How do you ever make a profit?

11:43.882 --> 11:47.769
You pay all the employees enough money.

11:47.829 --> 12:08.663
And the deal was that I had a patent on it, and the deal was that they would use my patent and pay me 5% gross sales royalty until they had gotten their investment back, and then they would go up to 10%.

12:09.031 --> 12:10.613
They never got to 10%.

12:10.713 --> 12:17.822
After seven years, my son-in-law, who's a CPA, came and demanded to see their books.

12:17.842 --> 12:20.846
And he said, that's the crookedest bunch of people I've ever seen over there.

12:21.547 --> 12:23.009
They're never going to make a profit.

12:23.810 --> 12:28.035
So yeah, that's kind of the story of that.

12:28.736 --> 12:31.680
And I'd do anything.

12:32.993 --> 12:36.818
that I can use my scientific background to do.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.400
I've got a little device.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.343
Do you like to feed hummingbirds by any chance?

12:41.524 --> 12:42.144
Do you really?

12:43.006 --> 12:44.207
My wife very much does.

12:44.968 --> 12:47.371
Well, you've got to have one of my devices.

12:50.435 --> 12:52.437
I do some other strange things.

12:52.538 --> 12:56.683
I've got a patent here that I got about a year ago.

12:56.703 --> 13:00.908
And this is, it's on this device right here.

13:02.508 --> 13:06.875
What is that device for?

13:06.895 --> 13:17.591
This is the world's best device for dissolving gases in liquids.

13:18.492 --> 13:26.624
It's the device I used at Monsanto in that last experiment that I told you about where I was dissolving phosgene.

13:26.645 --> 13:29.629
If you have no gas, it's very soluble in liquid.

13:29.947 --> 13:31.049
Who cares?

13:31.450 --> 13:33.675
Who wants to dissolve gases and liquids?

13:33.715 --> 13:37.263
Well, sewage treatment plants, for God's sake.

13:37.925 --> 13:47.145
They need tremendous amounts of dissolved oxygen to allow these activated sludge microorganisms in there to destroy the organic matter.

13:47.632 --> 13:57.063
Fish can't grow in fish-form ponds very well unless they're supplied with an adequate amount of oxygen.

14:00.408 --> 14:03.371
This can be used in all kinds of other.

14:03.852 --> 14:15.546
The best way to destroy bacteria, microorganisms, and swimming pools and spiles is not to put chlorine in.

14:16.910 --> 14:19.553
or not to use chlorine in your drinking water.

14:21.075 --> 14:22.256
You use ozone.

14:24.178 --> 14:30.585
Ozone has about the same problem of dissolving in water as oxygen does.

14:30.605 --> 14:36.451
This little device I created in the general mills one day.

14:36.471 --> 14:39.795
I was trying to run a reaction.

14:40.619 --> 14:43.923
that involved a gas that was one of the reactants.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.126
I had to dissolve it in this liquid.

14:47.388 --> 14:49.130
And when it dissolved, it reacted.

14:49.310 --> 14:56.659
And it took me all day, nine hours, to run this reaction in only a small amount of material.

14:56.720 --> 15:03.188
And I got irritated, and I went in the glassblowing room and made a little glass device that was much smaller than this.

15:03.668 --> 15:06.492
But all it is is an inverted cone.

15:08.463 --> 15:16.213
where the bottom is about half the diameter of the top, and there's a lot of holes now.

15:16.433 --> 15:23.042
My original one had some tiny, tiny holes around this peripheral area.

15:23.062 --> 15:33.475
I put it in this reaction mixture, and what took nine hours now took one hour, because I could simply dissolve the gas nine times faster.

15:33.955 --> 15:36.799
I have never found any device on the market

15:37.724 --> 15:41.650
commercial size or lab size, that will duplicate this.

15:42.751 --> 15:48.499
But I had very tiny holes, about 1 16th inch holes and not very many of them in that original device.

15:48.519 --> 15:59.074
I thought for years, God, if I could only figure a way to scale that thing up to large size, commercial size, without it plugging up,

16:00.117 --> 16:01.058
by debris.

16:01.219 --> 16:06.046
Any debris is going to plug up these tiny holes because this is a centrifugal pump.

16:06.426 --> 16:13.036
When you turn it at high velocity, it simply attaches to an electric motor on a shaft here.

16:13.437 --> 16:20.026
You turn this at fairly high velocity, this thing pumps water up inside here and throws out those holes.

16:20.527 --> 16:27.998
And if you introduce some air along with it, now you're chopping big bubbles into tiny, tiny bubbles.

16:28.400 --> 16:36.517
And the rate of solution of a gas and a liquid is directly proportional to the contact area between the two.

16:37.158 --> 16:41.888
If you chop a bubble in two, you know what you do to the total surface?

16:42.790 --> 16:43.431
You double it.

16:44.313 --> 16:46.898
Every time you chop a bubble in two, you double the surface.

16:47.198 --> 16:52.506
you would then double the rate of solution of whatever that material is.

16:53.127 --> 17:02.521
And so all I was trying to do was to chop big bubbles into little bubbles, and all the other devices that are on the market do everything but that.

17:03.903 --> 17:09.932
And so when I sent the application into the patent office,

17:10.773 --> 17:16.161
The patent office looked at my drawings and said, oh, that thing is so simple.

17:17.142 --> 17:24.634
The lady examiner said, somebody's done that before, a long time before, I'm sure.

17:24.654 --> 17:27.398
I haven't found it yet, but I'm going to.

17:27.418 --> 17:31.684
And after six and a half years, she gave me a patent.

17:33.048 --> 17:43.142
And her excuse, wrote it in the letter, I'm being transferred to another division in the patent office and I'm cleaning off my desk.

17:45.130 --> 17:48.637
And so I have the patent and we are now in the process.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.922
I had it checked.

17:51.282 --> 18:03.747
I did about 500 experiments out there in my garage over about six years on this thing, varying everything I could think of.

18:04.064 --> 18:21.313
And since I have no background in engineering at all, I found $60,000 from a friend of mine to support an 18-month study, a 14-month study of this device.

18:21.293 --> 18:32.250
seeing if they could duplicate, in Department of Chemical Engineering, Mark Holtzapel is a young chemical engineer that directed this work, seeing if they could duplicate my results.

18:33.853 --> 18:46.373
And the results, I believe, I believe 80% of the energy used in a typical sewage treatment plant is used just to pump air.

18:49.002 --> 18:54.611
15 to 20 percent of the oxygen in there is all that dissolves each time.

18:55.893 --> 18:58.176
That's inefficiency of the worst kind.

19:00.520 --> 19:06.349
They pump their air in eight feet deep in these big digestion tanks.

19:07.390 --> 19:14.942
I can dissolve 80 percent in a one foot depth with this device.

19:16.677 --> 19:27.338
And so I believe that if we, we're getting ready to try to figure out a way to do this, check this on a large scale.

19:27.398 --> 19:29.582
University has a sewage treatment plant.

19:30.444 --> 19:33.049
They would be, and they are,

19:33.316 --> 19:44.772
did some additional design things that improved the behavior of this, and so we're taking out a supplemental patent, which will be 40% owned by A&M.

19:45.693 --> 19:54.666
And so they're involved in this too, and the Office of Technology Transfer is now looking for companies

19:54.646 --> 20:00.539
that might be interested in building and distributing these things.

20:01.200 --> 20:12.925
I really do believe that I could put these in a typical sewage treatment plant and lower the cost

20:13.394 --> 20:26.389
the actual total cost of sewage treatment to 50% of what it is now, and I have data that indicates it might be one-fourth of what it is now.

20:26.629 --> 20:35.419
Now, I don't know whether that data will substantiate it or not, but that's the kind of crazy things I get involved with.

20:36.079 --> 20:37.461
If I see something

20:38.133 --> 20:46.911
that needs a solution, and I can use my scientific background, I tackle it, and I have them quit.

20:46.931 --> 20:47.652
Well, that's great.

20:48.254 --> 20:53.645
Let's see, I need to let you relax in a little bit, so I'm getting near the end.

20:54.146 --> 20:55.569
Okay, that way.

20:56.150 --> 20:56.310
Oh.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.905
I've got just a few more.

21:01.105 --> 21:01.546
Okay, sure.

21:02.187 --> 21:13.943
If we could get all of the people out of your A&M experience back here, who would be the ones you would like to express appreciation to most?

21:15.686 --> 21:20.172
Oh, Morgan, the first president that

21:21.400 --> 21:30.151
He was a tremendous reason for me staying when I had great tendencies to leave.

21:30.352 --> 21:31.313
That's President Morgan.

21:31.593 --> 21:32.735
That's President Morgan.

21:33.135 --> 21:42.788
Paul Calloway was my personal friend, and when I lost my Welch grant, he went out of his way.

21:42.808 --> 21:45.111
I was out of business in my research.

21:45.231 --> 21:46.733
I took all my equipment.

21:48.704 --> 21:50.446
In fact, it was interesting.

21:51.087 --> 22:00.078
They said, you don't no longer have a Welsh grant and we want to take all of your permanent equipment and ship it to Texas Southern University.

22:00.739 --> 22:05.004
I guess that was an extra slap because that's a black university.

22:05.365 --> 22:12.754
And I did that and happened to ship it to a friend of mine down there, a chemist.

22:12.987 --> 22:15.731
Yeah, Paul Callaway, no question.

22:16.432 --> 22:16.913
Who else?

22:19.136 --> 22:20.118
Well, Earl Rudder.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.823
I couldn't leave him out at all.

22:24.204 --> 22:30.172
Earl Rudder, in my opinion, stumbled and fumbled a lot, but really got the job done.

22:31.494 --> 22:33.437
Wayne Hall, no question about it.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.023
One of my best friends still.

22:39.146 --> 22:40.007
Who else?

22:42.248 --> 22:43.149
George Kreiss.

22:43.830 --> 22:47.796
George and I get together and two things up every so often.

22:48.317 --> 22:49.879
Is he still active and around?

22:49.899 --> 22:52.483
No, he still lives here, but he's retired.

22:53.084 --> 22:55.908
No, but I mean, he's still, so I could interview him.

22:55.928 --> 22:56.389
Oh, yes.

22:56.509 --> 22:59.374
You ought to look George Kreiss up.

22:59.394 --> 23:00.575
He'd give you a good interview.

23:00.615 --> 23:01.957
I haven't seen him in a good one.

23:02.017 --> 23:03.460
Well, he's still here.

23:04.241 --> 23:04.581
Let's see.

23:04.701 --> 23:10.450
Do you have any advice if you were called upon to give advice to the A&M leadership today?

23:11.290 --> 23:15.780
What counsel would you give them?

23:18.206 --> 23:22.877
In all honesty, I don't normally think in those terms.

23:22.897 --> 23:24.821
I still think like a scientist.

23:26.164 --> 23:28.590
Well, what should A&M's scientific goals be?

23:29.768 --> 23:31.710
What should they strive to attain?

23:32.651 --> 23:36.074
They're getting close to what I think they're capable of being.

23:36.114 --> 23:42.520
One of the top ten chemistry departments in the country.

23:43.861 --> 23:44.942
And they're not there yet.

23:45.863 --> 23:47.565
But they're not too far from there.

23:47.645 --> 23:51.408
But you think that's an appropriate goal for them to strive for?

23:51.448 --> 23:52.850
For me it sure would be.

23:53.410 --> 23:58.375
I would be mighty proud to say I was once a part of that organization.

23:59.198 --> 24:01.342
All right, then the last two things.

24:01.382 --> 24:18.793
The first is a plea that if you have any A&M related materials, papers or anything that you ever want to dispose of, I would beg that you call the A&M archives because it is now well organized.

24:19.448 --> 24:24.353
and that would be a place where they would be preserved for everyone's benefit forever.

24:27.336 --> 24:38.889
I still have some of my old files that I had in my office and they're in the old Herman Heap Bible Chemistry building.

24:39.529 --> 24:42.032
I had so much stuff I couldn't bring.

24:42.092 --> 24:44.815
I've got books stacked up over there.

24:44.795 --> 24:46.118
Don't know what to do with them.

24:46.138 --> 24:47.220
I need to give them somebody.

24:47.341 --> 24:51.450
I would beg you, give those books to the library.

24:52.452 --> 24:53.334
They're welcome, Tom.

24:53.915 --> 24:54.517
They're welcome.

24:54.577 --> 24:55.920
You would need to let them know.

24:55.960 --> 25:04.018
Then any of those files, it would be better for the archives to sort through them than for them to go to the dump.

25:04.724 --> 25:07.468
I was worried about people just throwing things away.

25:07.728 --> 25:11.614
I will not throw them away without sorting myself very carefully through them.

25:12.155 --> 25:17.142
And then if I feel that they are of any value over there, I'll be glad to.

25:18.704 --> 25:22.009
All right, then next to last question.

25:23.171 --> 25:24.172
Next to last question.

25:27.297 --> 25:31.002
If someone gave you a check for a million dollars,

25:33.277 --> 25:49.987
and had only one condition on that sum, that you must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you can decide what use would be made of the money, what would you have A&M do if you had the capacity to give them a big gift?

25:50.027 --> 25:51.690
What would you have them do with that gift?

25:55.501 --> 26:02.968
There have been, in the process of doing this research for this patent, the chemistry department was exceedingly helpful for me.

26:03.008 --> 26:18.622
They got chemicals and some electronic measuring equipment, oxygen meters and things like that for me, which I would have had a difficult time doing because they were buying it at a university discount.

26:19.743 --> 26:24.968
The electrical engineering department lent me some of their equipment

26:24.948 --> 26:29.095
I couldn't forget those two departments specifically.

26:29.135 --> 26:40.854
This patent can be one of the most valuable patents that you've ever encountered.

26:41.555 --> 26:45.942
It can be used if it's as good as it appears to be.

26:45.982 --> 26:51.411
There's no sewage treatment plant in the country, in the world.

26:51.998 --> 26:56.173
that could do without them because they can sell you so much money.

26:56.434 --> 26:59.143
They're easy to make, very cheap.

27:02.214 --> 27:03.358
And so I thought,

27:03.878 --> 27:06.521
I'm too old to be a playboy anymore.

27:07.022 --> 27:09.024
A million dollars or whatever.

27:10.105 --> 27:11.307
I don't know what I would do with it.

27:12.228 --> 27:18.636
But I have some things that I could do with them.

27:19.397 --> 27:26.405
I will, whatever excess money that I make on this, and it could be a good million of dollars.

27:27.426 --> 27:30.730
This is the best mixer you've ever seen.

27:31.233 --> 27:34.799
It mixes more efficiently than any mixing device.

27:35.901 --> 27:49.883
We took some water from one of the big chemical plants, some wastewater that had chemicals in there that they could not remove any more of.

27:50.318 --> 27:54.184
but they didn't meet EPA requirements to dump it.

27:54.204 --> 28:01.817
We cleaned, we had 8,000 gallons of water, a surrender mine used this, and cleaned it up in five minutes.

28:01.837 --> 28:03.600
It was drinkable water.

28:05.744 --> 28:07.907
It's got all kinds of applications.

28:07.967 --> 28:10.251
I could make a lot of money.

28:12.256 --> 28:20.367
I would take almost every bit of that and put it in a tax-free, tax-exempt foundation.

28:25.614 --> 28:38.871
I would take all the proceeds from that and I have told my kids in detail about this.

28:41.129 --> 28:59.169
was to be used for bright kids, poor kids who couldn't get an education otherwise.

29:04.955 --> 29:06.857
I would say to that personally, amen.

29:08.338 --> 29:09.820
Can't think of a better use for it.

29:10.964 --> 29:16.840
no better investment can be made any way you measure the definition of investment.

29:16.921 --> 29:22.446
And you, your background is so much like mine, you know what I'm talking about.

29:22.466 --> 29:31.494
I wanted, I loved to learn as much as any kid you can imagine.

29:31.534 --> 29:36.438
And yet I thought I could never get to where I wanted to go.

29:37.699 --> 29:41.282
And now that I have, I gotta pay back some way.

29:42.603 --> 29:43.424
And that's the best way.

29:44.024 --> 29:45.966
Last question is related to that.

29:47.110 --> 29:50.650
Looking back, what are your feelings about Texas A&M today?

29:52.319 --> 29:54.994
As you look back, how do you feel about that institution?

29:56.611 --> 30:09.667
You know, I'm a little bit schizophrenic since I have a degree from Baylor and two from Texas, and then I taught at A&M for about 25 years, but A&M is my school.

30:09.768 --> 30:11.350
There's no question about that.

30:12.151 --> 30:15.875
It has a different flavor than any of these other schools.

30:16.156 --> 30:18.939
It's just different, that's all, and I like the difference.

30:19.820 --> 30:25.167
I go on the campus, and kids fall out of their way trying to help me

30:25.147 --> 30:27.611
get this in my vehicle and things like that.

30:27.851 --> 30:29.554
It won't happen on other campuses.

30:30.836 --> 30:35.343
I just like the general attitude that apparently is still going on around here.

30:36.124 --> 30:42.755
I liked the, I didn't like what happened when the bonfire crashed, but.

30:46.821 --> 30:49.025
That's right.

30:49.045 --> 30:49.686
Let's quit there.
