WEBVTT

00:01.465 --> 00:05.953
Is there that similar spree at West Point? Sure. 
Would you compare them? Are there any

00:08.839 --> 00:09.861
differences? As far as spirit? No. The spirit is 
the same. They both have come

00:15.752 --> 00:21.583
in the same. Well, they have a 1,200-meter team up 
there. It's not just 11 on the field. It's 1,200 of

00:27.743 --> 00:29.245
them. It used to be 1,200. There's a lot more than 
that now.

00:41.899 --> 00:45.203
We have pep rallies the same way. Everybody's

00:45.223 --> 00:49.528
motivated. And it catches the same spirit, school 
spirit. It's strong. We had the same at Tarleton,

00:57.468 --> 01:01.514
Florida. We had the same school spirit there too. 
Yeah, the same as strong at Tarleton as you did at

01:02.355 --> 01:05.079
A&M. Yeah, only we had girls.

01:10.006 --> 01:11.689
Yeah, there's a difference there. And they've got 
girls at A&M now too. Sure do. And they've got girls

01:16.295 --> 01:18.739
at West Point now too. What's your opinion of that? 
Well, I was skeptical at first, but I think I'm a

01:24.272 --> 01:28.718
supporter.

01:31.561 --> 01:37.749
At West Point and A&M?

01:37.769 --> 01:37.849
Yes. Were you a leader in the Corps of Cadets? You 
certainly weren't in the Corps of Cadets, but were

01:41.874 --> 01:47.381
you a leader later at West Point? Yes. Well,

01:48.554 --> 02:08.543
were you telling

01:48.554 --> 02:08.543
anyone?

02:08.563 --> 02:11.828
Well, I was the selected as the highest ranking. 
Cleave in my company.

02:15.313 --> 02:15.874
And I was the senior. Is that it? My

02:18.895 --> 02:40.845
junior year,

02:18.895 --> 02:40.845
I was number one in my class in the military. I guess 
I was in line to be the first captain. So you always

02:42.959 --> 02:58.565
had those positions of leadership. Now, what do 
the cadets at West Point think of A&M?

03:11.343 --> 03:18.734
Well, most of them don't know a great deal about it, 
except they know of it. It's been advertised a lot

03:18.754 --> 03:24.062
by those of us that attended. Did they ask you a lot 
of questions? Were they at all interested?

03:31.954 --> 03:39.987
Well, it seemed like they were more interested

03:31.954 --> 03:39.987
after they got to know something. And they knew.

03:43.895 --> 03:51.386
They've known a lot of them, and they think a lot of

03:43.895 --> 03:51.386
them. Congratulations. Of course, you probably 
sat on promotion boards throughout your career.

03:56.713 --> 03:58.776
Was there any favoritism one way or the other? No. 
Where a man went to school, very little. They had

04:03.282 --> 04:04.604
nothing. I'd say almost nothing.

04:08.701 --> 04:31.338
What

04:08.701 --> 04:31.338
they've accomplished, how they've performed. I 
could see no changes based on that. No training or

04:32.119 --> 04:32.700
anything else. No, I've heard from some people 
that there's this West Point Protective

04:33.963 --> 04:41.795
Association, like a pile of crap. Okay, well, why? 
Tell me. Well, I've seen it operate. I've seen

04:47.424 --> 04:50.870
promotion boards. It

04:51.551 --> 04:58.141
goes beyond even that. Even close friends. It 
would not influence

05:02.515 --> 05:14.726
the decision. You pick the guy that you think can do 
the job, or you

05:14.746 --> 05:27.458
promote the guy that you think is the best man. I 
don't know. I just don't buy it. It's been a sort of

05:29.600 --> 05:31.982
protective association, a ring knocker, 
whatever you want to call it. Is there tension,

05:34.072 --> 05:40.758
though, between West Point officers and ROTC 
officers in the military? I didn't

05:41.699 --> 05:47.204
see military. I didn't sense

05:47.404 --> 05:55.091
that. Okay. Would you compare the quality of 
students at Tarleton and Anaheim, the ROTC

05:56.071 --> 06:03.538
schools, the quality of student attendance at 
West Point?

06:13.090 --> 06:20.582
Well, I would say that the new entrance exams that 
all of them are using, they're going to be awful

06:13.090 --> 06:20.582
complicated. Were they comparable? No. There was 
no such thing. Anybody could go to A&M or Tarleton.

06:32.028 --> 06:41.925
They had to pass an entrance

06:32.028 --> 06:41.925
exam. It was quite hard to show a certain level in 
college that they had accomplished to get exempt

06:41.945 --> 06:48.055
from taking an entrance exam. So which place do you 
think were superior students? That doesn't make

06:54.467 --> 06:56.109
them superior students. They're more selective 
in who can get in. They were selective. But in order

07:04.601 --> 07:12.633
to get into Carleton or A&M, all you had to do was be a 
high school graduate. I think it's changed now.

07:14.496 --> 07:17.380
But did you have an opinion about your colleagues? 
Which ones? Worked harder, got better grades.

07:34.805 --> 07:43.996
Well, after a guy gets through the first year

07:34.805 --> 07:43.996
at the military, he gets through. He's got another 
thing.

07:50.033 --> 08:07.872
He's proved he's

07:50.033 --> 08:07.872
got enough intelligence to pass the rest of them, 
in my opinion, because he's done it under

07:50.033 --> 08:07.872
pressure. And there are probably fewer of them to 
flunk out at West Point after the first year than on

08:07.892 --> 08:10.337
the other side.

08:18.333 --> 08:32.655
I'm only surmising this because I'm not familiar

08:18.333 --> 08:32.655
with what goes on in Tarleton or in, well, I am a 
little bit from Tarleton, but not in A&M. I'm not

08:32.675 --> 08:40.147
familiar with the figures or

08:32.675 --> 08:40.147
the problems that they're having. I'm just not 
familiar

08:40.167 --> 08:44.033
with it now. What did you decide to... You said that 
you received the appointment at West Point. At

08:51.109 --> 08:53.532
this time you were about a junior standing. Why did 
you decide to leave A&M with only about one year

08:54.754 --> 09:07.611
left of school and go to four more at West Point? I 
decided I wanted to make the Army my group. Oh, you

09:11.890 --> 09:12.311
did? If I was going to do that, I wanted to be on the 
grounds floor. I knew that if I didn't get in West

09:18.219 --> 09:31.057
Point, I was going to try for a commission

09:18.219 --> 09:31.057
in the Army Reserve. In other words, you switched 
your your aims from being an engineer and going to

09:34.793 --> 09:45.185
MIT to becoming a regular Army? Yeah, a regular 
Army. Now, why did you switch your aims? Well, as I

09:51.072 --> 10:00.463
told you, I

09:51.072 --> 10:00.463
had an influence as a major vendor on Charlton 
Thorold and the These

10:02.047 --> 10:25.876
two

10:02.047 --> 10:25.876
guys, my parents,

10:02.047 --> 10:25.876
and another second lieutenant,

10:02.047 --> 10:25.876
just got out. They impressed me very much. Very 
impressed with them. They walked straight, stood

10:26.998 --> 10:27.658
tall. Everybody looked up to them. So it was 
basically because of a couple of people that

10:28.259 --> 10:29.661
influenced you? Yeah. I made the decision. They 
told me I had the point. That's when I made the

10:30.822 --> 10:31.463
decision. What was your response when you found 
that you had the appointment?

10:45.670 --> 10:49.515
I was late. I thought at the time, I knew I didn't 
want to be a farmer. I'd seen my grandfather. Sure.

10:57.806 --> 10:59.408
Sit on the porch and cry. Cotton

10:59.928 --> 11:21.998
was

10:59.928 --> 11:21.998
washed away,

10:59.928 --> 11:21.998
and

10:59.928 --> 11:21.998
my dad was in the construction business. Totally 
dependent on the weather. I thought I wanted to do

11:22.699 --> 11:23.501
the same thing. A little less dependent on what 
happened, nature-wise. So, in other words, you

11:26.219 --> 11:30.264
wanted the security of a military crew? Well, not 
only the security, but the excitement.

11:38.936 --> 11:42.261
How did you know it was exciting? Well,

11:42.281 --> 11:50.792
these lieutenants talked to me about it. So they 
told you your experiences, and you identified

11:53.185 --> 11:56.511
with those? Yeah.

11:59.637 --> 12:00.459
Okay. Why did you decide to go from Army infantry, 
which you previously had planned on, and then

12:01.641 --> 12:14.907
change to flying in the Air Corps?

12:32.740 --> 12:44.733
September 1941, and

12:32.740 --> 12:44.733
they decided to

12:32.740 --> 12:44.733
move our graduation date up six months. They also 
decided to allow those who wanted to take Air Corps

12:46.495 --> 13:00.031
training to take Air Corps training, and they sold 
me on

12:46.495 --> 13:00.031
it. Sold me on the opportunity. And I had my first 
tactical officer at Major Harper. He retired as a

13:08.458 --> 13:12.282
general. He was my tactical officer and he 
encouraged me. And I did. But did you, did you, of

13:18.669 --> 13:30.102
course we needed, not only did we need fliers, but 
we needed infantry officers during the war.

13:30.385 --> 13:34.271
Were you at all thrilled about the idea of being an 
aviator? There was a lot of glamour in the late

13:34.311 --> 13:39.759
1930s about aviation. Were you at all interested 
now? Well, we got, we were indoctrinated on the Air

13:42.623 --> 13:54.900
Force there, and we studied, and we were given 
orientation, pride. I decided I'd like to be a

13:56.423 --> 13:58.165
pilot. I knew we were going to war, and if I was going 
to war, I'd just as soon ride and walk.

14:05.722 --> 14:07.204
What kind of pilot did you want to be? Fighter 
pilot.

14:11.950 --> 14:13.352
And you had no problem with the physical?

14:16.376 --> 14:16.436
No. Let's start then about your career. When did 
you get your commission, second lieutenant? 19th

14:22.845 --> 14:25.148
of January, 1943. I got my wings on December 10th, 
42. So you had your wings before you had your own

14:28.586 --> 14:37.977
class that wore their wings at West Point. No 
kidding. The first class was shorter. The class

14:41.741 --> 14:48.569
after us graduated and got their wings on the same 
day they graduated.

14:48.589 --> 14:53.835
And you went down, your first flight school, 
flying school, was down And then June 42 to

14:54.254 --> 14:59.480
December 42 at Hicks Field in Fort Worth, right? 
Went to Hicks Field in June of 42. Mm-hmm. It just

15:02.264 --> 15:04.507
lasted three months. Mm-hmm. So you had three 
months of flight school. No, in primary, and then

15:07.911 --> 15:11.735
we went to basic. I went to basic at West Point and 
then went back to play football. Tell me about the

15:17.002 --> 15:21.207
flight school during the war. Was it adequate? Did 
it prepare you not to be a fighter pilot? I thought

15:25.527 --> 15:28.371
it was very adequate. And we had haze in there, too. 
Oh, kidding? Oh, yeah. You could never escape,

15:34.639 --> 15:36.181
could you? You got it every place. All aviation 
cadets got haze. It

15:42.029 --> 15:51.261
wasn't near as bad as... There was plenty of them. 
It was under control. Physical or mental? Both.

16:00.651 --> 16:01.351
Who hazed you? You were only there for three 
months? The upperclassmen. People that had been

16:04.375 --> 16:05.617
there for two months? Well, we were 42K,

16:06.238 --> 16:14.869
and the 42J was there, still there. They were the 
upperclassmen. I don't think we were there for six

16:18.134 --> 16:20.657
weeks. Six weeks, and then six weeks of basic. I 
don't remember the number of weeks. Anyhow,

16:27.564 --> 16:30.167
basic. We started in June. We had our wings in six 
months. So it must have been about two months at

16:32.711 --> 16:36.236
each place. Now tell me about black training.

16:45.668 --> 16:48.973
What exactly was the training on? Well, you had 
ground school, which covered theory and weather

16:50.995 --> 16:59.225
and subjects like that. And then you started the 
flight training, went along with it. You had

17:04.191 --> 17:07.955
ground school and flight training. And you were 
assigned to an instructor. And he took you up and

17:10.999 --> 17:18.808
demonstrated things to you and had you do

17:10.999 --> 17:18.808
them.

17:22.349 --> 17:28.255
After you've been up so far, and they give you a 
checkride, and you checked out all right, you'd

17:22.349 --> 17:28.255
get out and let you solo. After how long could you 
solo? Six or eight hours, somewhere. Six or eight

17:35.162 --> 17:38.385
hours of instruction, and they already had you 
soloing? Yeah. Did you feel that the flight school

17:39.326 --> 17:43.690
was adequate, free or freer, when you were late? 
Oh, yeah, I know it was tremendous. I really

17:45.452 --> 17:49.356
did. I'll never forget the first day. mean not the 
first day the first day we went out so i didn't see

17:52.150 --> 18:17.128
this guy hicks feeling forward

17:52.150 --> 18:17.128
man you're going out into the area today for the 
first time don't let any clouds get between you and

17:52.150 --> 18:17.128
hicks field if an airplane comes up to you and does a 
series of dives and zoom return to hicks field and

17:52.150 --> 18:17.128
land immediately

18:17.902 --> 18:23.791
My good friends are there with me now, and I always 
recite that to each other. We remember that so

18:23.811 --> 18:25.994
vividly.

18:28.778 --> 18:33.345
And I remember the first time my instructor did a 
spin, I thought the airplane was going to come

18:28.778 --> 18:33.345
apart. No kidding. You were scared. Well, it 
scared me, yeah. But I didn't know what a spin was

18:41.817 --> 18:46.744
until he did it. I knew what a spin was, but I'd never 
experienced one. Were there many casualties

18:53.139 --> 18:55.923
during the training period? I mean, did you lose 
many of your cadets? Yes, quite a few washed out.

19:02.473 --> 19:12.948
Not as many of the ones from West Point as the 
regular aviation cadets, because most of them

19:02.473 --> 19:12.948
then were nothing but high school graduates. And 
they were much younger and inexperienced. Well,

19:17.099 --> 19:19.261
we had some of our group washed out, too. They had no

19:19.281 --> 19:28.510
ability to apply. What about deaths? Did you have 
very many? No, not many. Just a couple? I don't

19:36.298 --> 19:40.302
recall us having any in primary or basic.

19:43.345 --> 19:45.587
One of my classmates was killed in advance.

19:48.757 --> 19:53.223
We were one of the first experimental classes. 
They let us fly our fighters 10 hours before we

19:53.283 --> 20:00.092
graduated. We were flying

20:00.112 --> 20:13.130
the B-39,

20:00.112 --> 20:13.130
and one of my classmates spun in. I don't know what 
happened. Then you went on in January 1943. We went

20:16.381 --> 20:24.691
back to West Point on December 10th of January 1943 
and we had our senior year. So you had your senior

20:24.711 --> 20:27.754
year for six months? No, six weeks. Oh, for six 
weeks you had your whole senior year?

20:37.685 --> 20:41.730
Well, obviously the necessity of war.

20:42.638 --> 20:47.145
What'd you think about having a nine or ten month 
course in six weeks? How'd they ever do that? Well,

20:51.152 --> 20:54.357
they just condensed the courses and gave you what 
they could.

21:00.407 --> 21:03.432
There's military history and law, military law.

21:12.052 --> 21:15.557
Was there any grumbling from the students? No, we 
were happy to leave. That's what I thought. Were

21:19.783 --> 21:21.005
you eager to get to war? Yes. Is that the feeling at 
West Point? Yes. I wanted to get in action.

21:31.179 --> 21:35.945
Okay, so in April 1943, you didn't get in action. 
You went to the 323rd Fighter Squadron. and then at

21:40.553 --> 21:42.235
Langley also. Here you have, for the next year, 
April 43 to 44, you were at four different bases.

21:50.244 --> 21:50.765
Why is that? Why do you keep moving your own? Well, 
that's part of the program. You move from place to

21:56.531 --> 22:02.818
place, and you have a different mission in each 
place and different training. We did strafing at

22:03.179 --> 22:08.805
Langley at the Langley Range, and then we went up to 
New Jersey. air-to-air gunnery out on the ocean.

22:12.071 --> 22:17.318
And we were also, at all these places, we were 
flying air defense. We were protecting capital.

22:20.321 --> 22:28.811
And we were intercepting bogey under training 
conditions. And we had people setting actual

22:28.891 --> 22:37.481
alert

22:28.891 --> 22:37.481
in Washington. Thank you for that. There never 
was, I don't know. There was never an enemy

22:42.529 --> 22:44.751
aircraft. That was never sighted, was there? No. 
We did sight some submarines. Oh, really? Yeah. No

22:50.617 --> 22:50.838
kidding. Did you ever fire on one? No. We weren't 
allowed to. Why not? I don't know. They were, were

22:59.106 --> 23:02.910
they enemy or were they, you could never identify 
them? No, we just told them where we saw them and

23:03.131 --> 23:06.514
they took it from there. Mm-hmm. So they might have 
been American. They could

23:10.539 --> 23:16.425
have been. When did you finally get overseas? We 
got over in October 1943. Okay, October 1943. And

23:25.216 --> 23:27.258
what division were you with? What was your job? I 
was an

23:30.281 --> 23:35.948
element leader in the flag.

23:39.573 --> 23:41.216
What type of aircraft? P-47s. P-47s? And where did 
they send you? They sent us to England. So this is in

23:48.788 --> 23:51.713
preparation for Normandy. At that time it wasn't. 
We were in the 8th Air Force, and we flew escort for

23:54.417 --> 23:59.766
the bombers.

24:02.290 --> 24:06.897
But then in,

24:02.290 --> 24:06.897
I think it was February, They formed the 9th Air 
Force. We were one of the original groups, and we

24:10.596 --> 24:13.980
changed bases. We started preparation.

24:20.990 --> 24:37.913
And we started dive bombing

24:20.990 --> 24:37.913
on buzz bomb sites and rocket sites and airfields

24:20.990 --> 24:37.913
and bridges and trains and whatever. Did you work 
with any RIL?

24:44.049 --> 24:50.799
Well, I suppose we did, but not our group. Side by 
side? Not side by side, not our group. What did you

24:55.325 --> 24:56.687
think of the British people? We liked them. We 
thought they were very

24:59.571 --> 25:08.423
difficult to work with if you had anything to deal 
with. civilian hierarchy, the clerk of the works,

25:09.280 --> 25:19.231
because they had so many rules and regulations 
they had to follow.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.436
Well and I impossible now. I wasn't in on that. All I 
could hear was the guys talking about it. Sure.

25:27.881 --> 25:29.803
They had to. We were doing nothing but fire. How 
often did you fly on these attacks and on the bomber

25:33.707 --> 25:38.933
missions? Well, I mean the group flew almost every 
day.

25:47.550 --> 25:51.376
And how many fighter planes were in the group? 
Well, we flew 16 airplanes per squadron, so we had

25:52.438 --> 26:05.697
48 aircraft in the group, but we had more than that, 
aircraft and pilots assigned.

26:08.461 --> 26:12.084
And so one squadron would fly every day, usually? 
Well, all three squadrons, when we started, all

26:12.164 --> 26:17.149
three squadrons would fly every day. A group would 
fly. And then after we got in the 9th Air Force, we no

26:19.831 --> 26:25.076
longer flew group missions. We flew squadron 
missions. The strafing? Strafing, bomb, dive

26:28.279 --> 26:30.621
bomb, strafing. They told us when we got over 
there, when we were escorted, we shouldn't go over

26:31.923 --> 26:36.747
20,000 feet. Yeah, we weren't supposed to go below 
20,000 feet because the ME-109, the Focke-Wulf

26:37.216 --> 26:45.248
190 would shoot us down. And I recall on the second 
mission I went on, I was flying the element on the

26:47.591 --> 26:55.703
wing commander.

26:58.707 --> 27:03.274
We had some Focke-Wulf 190s come and go through the 
formation, and I peeled off on the one that came

27:03.980 --> 27:10.886
through us and followed him. And I went on down to 
about 15,000 feet, and I fired. He was already away

27:18.853 --> 27:22.396
from me. And I got my wingman and compressibility, 
which was the problem. People would get too fast

27:28.762 --> 27:32.265
and get controlled for the first time. And when I 
came back and got back up in formation, got back out

27:34.152 --> 27:41.258
on the ground, I was chewed out for going above 
20,000 feet. And then about two or three months

27:42.199 --> 27:57.212
later, when we went to the 9th Air Force, we never 
got above 15,000 feet for the rest of

27:42.199 --> 27:57.212
the war. When the bombers bombed, they bombed 
about 20,000? No, they were above 20. There were

28:05.228 --> 28:07.511
more up by 30. The

28:07.531 --> 28:12.697
flak was pretty bad. Yeah. I remember my first 
mission. We took off and we had to climb through

28:18.545 --> 28:21.048
clouds. As soon as we got airborne, we were in the 
clouds. We didn't break out of it until we were over

28:23.631 --> 28:31.041
20,000 feet and we already crossed over the coast. 
I looked back and I saw all this flak come up there,

28:31.274 --> 28:35.140
and I said, man, this is war. Until then, I hadn't 
seen any evidence of war, but I saw it then. What

28:42.271 --> 28:43.033
were your feelings? Well, you get a feeling of fear 
and respect right quick.

28:56.494 --> 28:57.315
And then...

29:04.450 --> 29:08.914
on some of the missions that we got to escort. We'd 
read about them the next day and the stars would

29:09.175 --> 29:11.697
strike. It made me feel sort of proud

29:11.717 --> 29:17.062
to be a part of it. Now, were most of the bomber 
missions directed toward Germany by that time?

29:22.728 --> 29:27.853
Yes, most of them were in Germany, although some of 
them were— Still in France? Some of them were in

29:29.174 --> 29:33.478
France and in Northern Europe.

29:37.255 --> 29:40.318
Most of them at that time. On your missions,

29:40.338 --> 29:47.865
I didn't see it on here, how many kills did you have? 
I didn't have any kills. Why not? I never got the

29:50.948 --> 29:52.570
opportunity. OK. What did you think of? Did you 
think that that was kind of strange? That you

29:58.635 --> 29:59.636
didn't see them? No. Why? There were plenty of them 
that lots of people didn't see. Well, you just had

30:04.829 --> 30:14.458
to be at the right place at the right time, and it's 
not

30:04.829 --> 30:14.458
unusual. I only fired one, and that was on about my 
third or fourth mission or something like that. I

30:21.786 --> 30:23.988
never saw another one. In other words, by 1943— 
Except on the ground. Yeah, by 1943 or 1944, the

30:27.511 --> 30:33.317
number of German airplanes was reduced. Well, we 
were transferred to the 9th Air Force, and the 8th

30:33.500 --> 30:41.771
Air Force then got the P-51s, and they started 
picking them up, really. And they are the ones

30:41.791 --> 30:51.403
protecting the bombers, and they were coming 
after the bombers, but they didn't send any

30:41.791 --> 30:51.403
fighters

30:41.791 --> 30:51.403
after us. Because we were low-level, low-level 
dive bombers.

30:58.052 --> 31:01.937
And not too far into France, even. So they didn't 
have any airplanes that bothered us. When you got

31:08.528 --> 31:18.938
there in 1943, what do you think was the opinion of 
our American fighter planes versus the Germans?

31:18.958 --> 31:20.780
Well, in altitude, we were better. And the low 
altitude capability

31:21.401 --> 31:31.030
of the P-47 We thought

31:33.052 --> 31:46.592
that the ME-109 and the Focke-Wulf 109 could 
out-turn us, but we could

31:33.052 --> 31:46.592
outrun them. What about our armaments, 
firepower? Well, we had eight machine guns, and

31:49.196 --> 31:54.003
they didn't have that much armament. We had the 
good armament. We thought we had a little better

31:57.728 --> 31:59.110
armament anyway.

32:06.548 --> 32:33.276
The

32:06.548 --> 32:33.276
P-38,

32:06.548 --> 32:33.276
I don't think that it survived.

32:33.296 --> 32:34.517
They did use them on reconnaissance, but they 
didn't survive. As a matter of fact, when we went

32:34.537 --> 32:35.678
into France, we went to place near Nancy, and he 
took over an old

32:37.531 --> 32:59.813
German airfield, and in the walls of

32:37.531 --> 32:59.813
their officer's club it showed pictures of 
Focke-Wulf 190s shooting down P-38s. It's very

32:59.833 --> 33:00.273
interesting. What was your general opinion of the 
quality of the We

33:06.438 --> 33:29.111
had real good

33:06.438 --> 33:29.111
pilots.

33:29.131 --> 33:29.912
But we were well trained. But we didn't think much 
of the leadership down there. No. Because they

33:31.114 --> 33:33.477
could have bombed on the right end of the 
submission. Instead, they chose to bomb churches

33:33.497 --> 33:34.839
and things like that. It used to make the British 
mad. And they lost the

33:36.661 --> 33:42.910
Battle of Britain. But you thought as far as the 
pilots were concerned, they were as well trained,

33:42.930 --> 33:50.321
better trained, compared with the Americans? No, 
I don't think they were better trained than the

33:51.362 --> 33:54.707
Americans. They probably weren't as well trained 
as the Americans. Some of them were very

33:57.191 --> 34:02.719
experienced, and they had some they were not.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.275
I think overall our training was better. That is 
initial training. And of course

34:12.661 --> 34:20.133
the British were well trained too. They had lots of 
experience. Did you go on any exercises with the

34:20.734 --> 34:23.478
RAF? Did you ever work with the British pilots in 
any of the striking missions? No? Always a general

34:32.331 --> 34:34.815
opinion of the RAF pilots.

34:41.444 --> 35:02.119
Well,

34:41.444 --> 35:02.119
we thought they were good pilots. We didn't get to 
associate with them. You know about the fourth,

35:02.900 --> 35:03.561
right? The fourth. It was Americans who were with 
the R.E.F. when they transferred to the U.S.A.

35:04.663 --> 35:05.865
after we got over there. Were you happy to change 
from bomber missions, where you were a fighter

35:07.043 --> 35:14.713
protection for bombers, to strafing? No, we 
wanted to shoot down some airplanes.

35:19.459 --> 35:28.171
We were doing nothing but dive bombing and 
strafing.

35:29.072 --> 35:29.993
It was exciting. I can imagine. Plenty of flak. We 
had plenty of losses, too. And this was the period

35:37.615 --> 35:41.741
of, what was this? D.D. Yeah, it was the period 
before D.D., yeah, before the Normandy invasion.

35:49.371 --> 35:57.942
Were you then, you were bombing basically, or 
strafing and bombing, dive bombing, basically

35:49.371 --> 35:57.942
French

36:03.473 --> 36:05.395
Anything that looked like supplies. Yeah, and we 
grew up a lot of bridges. We tried, and what we did

36:09.781 --> 36:15.708
was try to cut all the railroads and all the big 
bridges all the way around Paris. Sure. Coming

36:16.469 --> 36:19.032
towards Normandy. Mm-hmm. And, uh, in a media. In 
marshland yards, we had lots of marshland yards.

36:30.706 --> 36:31.827
And, uh, as I say, these, uh, places that were 
launching missiles, B-1, B-2. Now how could you

36:39.966 --> 36:41.749
identify those places? They, uh, intelligence, 
and they took pictures, reconnaissance, took

36:43.051 --> 36:55.392
pictures and bring you, bring you back a picture to 
show you, to show you what to do. And give you the

36:55.412 --> 36:56.614
coordinates? Oh yeah. And did you get any of those? 
Oh yes, lots

37:01.583 --> 37:05.647
of them. And did they, were they the type of, when 
you exploded them, or when you hit them, did they

37:05.667 --> 37:14.095
explode, or did they just? No, they didn't 
explode. They just fell over? Well,

37:18.019 --> 37:22.644
they blew up.

37:26.347 --> 37:28.189
You had craters.

37:30.700 --> 37:49.132
How

37:30.700 --> 37:49.132
successful do you think you were in your task? 
Well, we think we were highly successful.

38:01.835 --> 38:03.798
I think that's what made the invasion go. At any 
time did you work with Curtis LeMay? No. Did you

38:12.391 --> 38:15.856
later work with him when he was in charge of Sion? 
Because he was over in the European theater. Yes, I

38:20.283 --> 38:27.074
knew who

38:20.283 --> 38:27.074
he was. He was a big airport guy. After we left, it 
was night there. Who was your commander? I don't

38:32.738 --> 38:35.182
know, Whalen. Whalen? Yeah. How was he? 
Tremendous.

38:42.192 --> 38:42.612
Tremendous. Tremendous. In what way? Well,

38:45.016 --> 39:00.698
he came by to see us and talk to us

38:45.016 --> 39:00.698
and encouraged us, inspired us.

39:08.322 --> 39:13.310
He'd come around, pin medals on people, things 
like that, talk to you.

39:21.802 --> 39:24.486
I saw that we got what we needed. Was there any 
problem with shortages in supplies? No. How about

39:30.496 --> 39:31.477
food? We didn't like the food in front of the 
shortage. But you always had enough bombs, and you

39:37.229 --> 39:45.138
always had enough ammunition, and the airplanes 
were well-maintained. I mean, as well as they

39:45.238 --> 39:48.422
could be under wartime conditions. Only one thing 
that I remember, the first time one of the B-1s, we

39:48.582 --> 40:03.439
were on the route right down through Maidstone, 
which is down on the south of Southwest. We were

40:04.145 --> 40:13.474
right on the route when the V-1s came over to go to 
London. The first one that came over, the Coastal

40:13.714 --> 40:25.726
Artillery, I mean, I guess it was whoever, the 
Coastal Artillery, I guess, was the one that was

40:13.714 --> 40:25.726
running the anti-aircraft around the base. They 
shot up all their ammunition and all the reserves.

40:28.069 --> 40:32.413
The first night one of them came over and they never 
did hit one. So did you have to scramble? Did you

40:36.560 --> 40:37.722
shoot those down? Yes, we shot a few of them down. 
Did you ever get the opportunity to hit one? No.

40:44.290 --> 40:50.598
Sometimes you were just lucky if you were coming 
back from a mission, one would be coming over so

40:44.290 --> 40:50.598
that you could chase it. And you'd see it. And you'd 
see it. Or you'd already be on the ground and want to

40:52.780 --> 40:58.287
go around and say, oh, well, you missed that one. 
But a couple of guys shot a few of them, shot one

40:58.327 --> 41:01.751
down. You picked them up on radar? We didn't have 
any right now. But I mean the British could pick

41:05.447 --> 41:07.109
them up. No, they were low level. They couldn't 
pick them up that low. They came in right over. They

41:12.037 --> 41:12.898
were right on the deck. About 50 feet or so. Maybe 
100.

41:21.271 --> 41:25.337
They were really exciting.

41:25.357 --> 41:27.280
I was wondering if you ever got shot down. Yes, I got 
shot down once. Can you tell me about that? Yes, we

41:31.246 --> 41:32.488
went in and We went

41:33.667 --> 41:38.153
in to dive on.

41:41.999 --> 41:53.295
We went in to

41:41.999 --> 41:53.295
dive on. And one place on the coast across from 
Dover there called Gray Graveling,

42:02.624 --> 42:15.499
G-R-A-V-E-L-I-N-E-S. And they always sent up 
about a burst of flak, about four or five bursts,

42:02.624 --> 42:15.499
every time you went near them. And we always asked 
when we got towards this particular day, we were at

42:15.519 --> 42:31.117
12,000 feet, coming out after having dive-bombed 
an airfield or a launching site. And good. I think

42:32.037 --> 42:34.740
this one was in Airfield. In northern France. 
Yeah. And we came back over and the flight leader,

42:36.382 --> 42:48.298
instead of passing when we got near this place, 
went straight over and a burst of flak came up in the

42:36.382 --> 42:48.298
hip. One burst hit the knee right in the engine. Was 
it below you when that exploded?

43:01.079 --> 43:02.301
And the big fan quit turning. And it got awfully 
quiet. And that's the thing that impressed me. It

43:08.108 --> 43:08.649
was so quiet. So I started gliding. And

43:14.957 --> 43:20.704
I got down to about 2,000 feet. And I decided I'd 
better jump out. I remember it was so big. Always

43:25.890 --> 43:26.852
when I got out there. Were you still over land? I was 
over the North Sea, over water. So you were over in

43:30.543 --> 43:32.345
the English Channel Zone? Yeah, all the time, 
because that's the gravelings right on that host.

43:37.913 --> 43:42.158
Anyhow, I unbuckled my parachute strap like I 
always did and started to get out. And I said, well,

43:42.198 --> 43:43.400
that's silly. You're supposed to try to sit back 
down and buckle my parachute. And about that time,

43:47.946 --> 43:53.553
I was getting pretty low, and so I just stood up on it 
and jumped out. So you opened up the canopy and

43:55.175 --> 43:57.758
jumped out. Mm-hmm. We'd been told the problem was 
hitting the tail, so what I did was step up on the

44:01.087 --> 44:07.295
side and jump as high as I could. And then I made it. 
Pulled my parachute, and this strap that comes

44:11.381 --> 44:20.112
across here came up and hit me in the nose and 
bludged my nose. I tried to guide myself, and I made

44:20.132 --> 44:26.841
the dry land about 50 yards. And it's minefields 
all around there, so of course what you do is you

44:27.479 --> 44:33.929
wait for the British to come get you. So I waited for 
the British and pretty soon they came out in a jeep

44:33.949 --> 44:39.798
and picked me up. And I got blood on that parachute, 
so that was ruined, so they gave me the parachute.

44:45.387 --> 44:49.774
And my wife's wedding dress was made out of that 
parachute. You were lucky to float over to

44:51.172 --> 44:55.357
England, weren't you? Or did you try to keep 
gliding until you could see the land? Well, I could

44:58.881 --> 45:01.163
see the land. I could see the land. It's not very far 
across there anyway. I was very lucky to be able to

45:06.549 --> 45:09.813
make it that far. You were lucky the wind wasn't 
blowing the other way, too. It made me mad. That was

45:16.180 --> 45:18.764
the next mission that day. I was supposed to be the 
first one that I had led, the whole group. The whole

45:23.070 --> 45:25.394
group on the mission. And now you didn't have a 
plane. I didn't have a plane. I wasn't even there. I

45:30.742 --> 45:37.392
got back over there and the group commander, I got 
back in time to go, but the group commander said no.

45:37.472 --> 45:40.757
Said she'd go and leave and go to London. So I did.

45:44.513 --> 45:45.814
That's pretty exciting. I bet you it was exciting. 
I bet you it was really exciting. How often did you

45:53.323 --> 45:55.325
get leads into London? Oh, they called it R&R. 
Yeah. Maybe every couple of months or something.

46:05.857 --> 46:08.280
Three days passed. R&R. How did the people in 
London treat the Americans? They treated us very

46:13.994 --> 46:17.438
nice, I thought.

46:21.201 --> 46:30.531
I remember one night, they had a blackout, of 
course.

46:30.571 --> 46:36.437
A taxi cab came along and stopped and asked me for 
directions. Sorry, I'm a stranger here.

46:43.627 --> 46:57.047
But when

46:43.627 --> 46:57.047
you were June 6, 1944, were you directly involved 
with D-Day on the initial invasion? I was directly

46:57.388 --> 47:12.250
involved because I was one of the ones that had to, I 
was then a system group operations officer, and I

46:57.388 --> 47:12.250
was in on the classified plans, and so I could not 
fly that day. But I did draw a commission. I drew a

47:18.425 --> 47:19.810
commission.
