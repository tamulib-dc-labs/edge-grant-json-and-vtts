WEBVTT

00:01.651 --> 00:17.450
and others it'll be a big national opportunity 
like the supercliner or a need like a

00:01.651 --> 00:17.450
supercomputer, although that really hasn't 
worked out because each institution is still too

00:01.651 --> 00:17.450
much caught up with we need to have our own for the 
statement it makes. We could have far greater

00:18.772 --> 00:29.245
supercomputing resources in the state for our 
institutions had we been able to in that early

00:18.772 --> 00:29.245
stage embrace this collaboration and had it at 
heart. But just not in the culture. You want to own

00:31.620 --> 00:32.621
your own. Yeah, we can talk about that. We've got 
hours. Yeah, yeah.

00:39.651 --> 00:40.532
That's what we're talking about. When we want to 
come over everybody's dead body, you get it.

00:43.417 --> 00:45.640
That's right. And in my judgment, from A&M, when I 
was on the campus responsible, hell, I know. who

00:54.740 --> 00:57.042
had the second worst job down there. I mean, right 
after being the football coach, you did not want to

00:57.102 --> 01:03.168
be in charge of computing, because it impacted 
everybody's life. And when the computer went

01:03.308 --> 01:06.471
down, my phone didn't stop ringing. Because at 
first they called the director of the computer

01:06.691 --> 01:11.616
center, and they couldn't get the satisfaction 
out of him. And then they wanted to know where the

01:11.676 --> 01:13.478
buck stopped. And so it was my suggestion from A&M 
that we get our major big time supercomputing

01:14.859 --> 01:23.127
resources in a collaboration with everybody else 
at HARC and let everybody share the best rather

01:23.393 --> 01:29.820
than piecing together what you could get. But it's 
hard to sell that. But we go through those issues.

01:38.450 --> 01:48.622
HARC is an incredible resource to the entities 
that are smart enough to know how to use it. And what

01:48.642 --> 01:53.147
I intend to do is to keep HARC quick responsive and 
flexible so that when one of our collaborative

01:53.836 --> 02:05.896
institutions calls us and says, hmm, it was just 
like this call just right now from George. We're

02:05.936 --> 02:08.440
talking about a $500 million opportunity. You 
can't pick up the phone call, any of these others,

02:09.161 --> 02:13.829
and talk about that. But we can do that here. I mean, 
those are opportunities that are fun. And they're

02:20.684 --> 02:24.429
exciting, and it takes the collaborative 
approach. As soon as, and you just have to be

02:26.532 --> 02:30.819
patient. It's working. It's not working nearly as 
rapidly as I could see that it could if you could

02:32.481 --> 02:40.132
just convince everybody else that you were right. 
If they'd just follow your lead and do what you say.

02:43.377 --> 02:47.242
And if they did, it'd probably all blow up, and 
you'd be sorry they did. So there's good checks and

02:47.302 --> 02:50.607
balances in the natural way things evolve. But it 
still evolves much faster here because it's

02:51.008 --> 02:54.091
private. It's free enterprise driven. It has a 
selection of people on its board that are

02:56.434 --> 03:01.119
handpicked because of their intellect and 
accomplishments. And it attracts

03:02.680 --> 03:11.109
the two percenters. That's an interesting 
concept. The guys that are really looking for the

03:14.372 --> 03:18.737
net under their life Don't want to touch this 
place. Because this is risky and

03:20.725 --> 03:22.708
entrepreneurial. I mean, you give up a tenured 
full professorship. I told Amy that when it came

03:25.571 --> 03:27.234
down. Yeah, so did I. So did I. Every one of my staff 
at T's that came here within a year to say, you know,

03:30.057 --> 03:37.787
I can't stay there. Is there a place for me here? I 
said, look, I'm going to tell you. When I left T's, I

03:43.295 --> 03:48.842
had a real gut-wrenching sense of responsibility 
for every one of them. Because I recruited you into

03:49.750 --> 03:51.993
that organization. I handpicked every one of 
those people. And we bought in together to the new

03:55.037 --> 04:02.067
direction and started to work on it and made it 
happen. And I said, that had the net of the state of

04:03.910 --> 04:06.814
Texas. We all had faculty tenured positions. And 
when I turned that in and left to come to HARC, this

04:09.778 --> 04:18.610
was an institution with the backing of no 
institution, an endowment of zero dollars, an

04:19.366 --> 04:29.618
idea and a concept that most of the time hadn't 
worked when similar things had been tried. And I

04:31.600 --> 04:42.352
did it easily, freely, simply, but I know the risk 
associated with it. In reality, If all of what I've

04:43.683 --> 04:55.984
been saying about the situation in the country is 
true, and I believe it is, there's an infinite

04:43.683 --> 04:55.984
number of other jobs that farm a net. You just don't 
know what it is. You just don't turn to it. But I'm

04:58.829 --> 05:06.923
confident any one of us here, if this place fell 
apart, could walk out of here and pick their job.

05:07.325 --> 05:08.166
And that's your net. That's a net. It's just not 
strong where you can look at it and say, ha, there it

05:09.468 --> 05:12.973
is. I see it. You just intuitively know it's out 
there. And that's different. And most people

05:17.200 --> 05:18.762
can't live with that. It's too risky. So what HARC 
attracts are those changers. But

05:24.891 --> 05:34.986
synergistically, my vision is that HARC will 
never be an educational institution formally,

05:24.891 --> 05:34.986
but it will be the place where the best education is 
given. This will be where the leaders of the

05:35.540 --> 05:40.727
collaborative institutions come and attract 
their graduate students. We will teach courses

05:40.927 --> 05:43.851
here, but they won't be HART courses. They'll be 
Texas A&M Rice courses. We'll be networked in

05:45.513 --> 05:47.756
satellite all over the world. Oxford and will 
become part of this. The Hungarian Academy of

05:51.460 --> 05:54.644
Science will be a collaborative institution. 
There will be researchers in Budapest doing HART

05:55.225 --> 06:05.378
research linked to Texas A&M, generating a 
product that Exxon is going to invest in and market

05:55.225 --> 06:05.378
in Brazil. And it'll work through the HARC 
scenario, just like the company we just created

06:06.556 --> 06:33.323
this year in Barcelona, Spain, that pulled 
together Interra and Canada, which is the best

06:06.556 --> 06:33.323
remote sensing company in the country, that 
couldn't get the contract from the Joint Research

06:06.556 --> 06:33.323
Center in Ispra, Italy of the EC to monitor the 
crops, that needed the technology that Andy

06:06.556 --> 06:33.323
Blanchard and our star center at HARC has. And we 
couldn't either, because you can't spend

06:36.880 --> 06:41.248
contract money out of the EC directly to a non-EC 
country. So what do you do? Well, with a

06:44.234 --> 06:54.433
fast-moving, creative international 
organization like HAARP, with a Swiss member on

06:44.234 --> 06:54.433
its board, Luc Tissot, with the knowledge of the EC 
system, says the country that has on the highest

06:54.970 --> 07:24.977
pecking order to receive such a contract is spain 
because they have the lease let's create a company

06:54.970 --> 07:24.977
in barcelona that's why we did it

06:54.970 --> 07:24.977
let's create the company in barcelona it'll 
receive the contract then you can subcontract to

06:54.970 --> 07:24.977
hark and to canada and to west berlin now berlin and 
hark did that and we'll be part of a 20 million

06:54.970 --> 07:24.977
dollar contract from the ec that'll lead to all 
kinds of leveraged advantages for Texas

07:26.138 --> 07:38.132
Instruments, eSystems, and other companies in 
Texas and in America playing in the C marketplace

07:26.138 --> 07:38.132
that might otherwise have all gone somewhere 
else. So we're going to stay entrepreneurial.

07:41.015 --> 07:42.637
We're going to stay opportunistic. But we've got a 
plan and a vision. I want the best minds doing

07:45.520 --> 07:51.967
research at HARC. I do not believe that HARC like 
any of the other institutions, can fully

07:56.412 --> 08:06.847
take advantage of the energies of the people we 
want here. I don't want them just to be at HARC. But I

08:11.093 --> 08:15.580
want them to be primarily at HARC. This will become 
the place where the brightest and the best migrate

08:15.600 --> 08:22.330
because it's risky. And they thrive on that. and 
because their graduate students will follow them

08:25.184 --> 08:28.067
here. And while they're still working on their 
PhDs at Rice and Texas A&M, they'll be doing that in

08:29.968 --> 08:37.675
the labs at Hark. And hence, the brightest and best 
from Rice will meet the brightest and best from

08:37.695 --> 08:42.600
Texas A&M. And that synergistic educational 
environment of learning will be far greater than

08:43.140 --> 08:51.468
what Rice or A&M can create singularly. And the 
classes will be held here. And they'll be taught by

08:56.234 --> 09:00.378
the Rice faculty and the A&M faculty. And if the 
faculty happens to be at heart that day doing

09:01.219 --> 09:10.387
research at heart, they walk into our classroom 
down here and teach the class. If the students

09:10.407 --> 09:12.089
happen to be here, they walk in. If they don't, they 
take it by satellite connection back to their

09:12.149 --> 09:16.093
campus. And if you happen to be here from Oxford, 
you do the same thing. And we network it right back

09:20.937 --> 09:23.980
in all over Europe, all over the world. And if 
Houston, coming back to my earlier comment, I

09:25.208 --> 09:37.720
really believe that there's going to be 8 to 12 
regions on the Earth, Mother Earth. And not more

09:38.581 --> 09:43.786
than two or three of them will be in America, if that 
many. And in my judgment, Texas, above all other

09:43.806 --> 09:50.513
states, has the best opportunity to lead for 
America. And Houston, above all other places in

09:51.254 --> 09:54.557
Texas, is the right place. And if Houston and 
Dallas can ever get over their local syndrome of

09:55.195 --> 10:09.630
the Bedouin philosophy of competing with one 
another, the Houston-Dallas region would be one

09:55.195 --> 10:09.630
of the heartthrobs of the world. And this region 
will become the Florence of the 21st century. And

10:16.597 --> 10:22.423
the people in the world that have broad ideas that 
want to be where the action is will come to Houston.

10:23.244 --> 10:24.105
And they'll come to heart. And Hark will be somehow 
linked in to almost every one of that kind of thing.

10:29.991 --> 10:31.133
And that can happen. And if it doesn't happen, and 
it doesn't happen in Houston, and Hark isn't a part

10:31.754 --> 10:38.667
of it, I don't know where in the hell in America it's 
going to happen. Because I don't see anybody else

10:38.687 --> 10:40.050
working on it. That's a very optimistic 
renaissance, neo-renaissance perception.

10:45.339 --> 10:46.301
That's interesting. That's good. And that's kind 
of what I see has to happen at the national level as

10:47.187 --> 10:54.995
part of the rapidly changing global marketplace. 
And there are going to be a few places, maybe

10:56.516 --> 10:59.739
Eastern Europe somewhere will capture. I think 
Berlin is going to be the new capital of Europe. I

11:03.803 --> 11:06.866
just got back from there last week. Impressive 
what's happened over there. Any number of things

11:09.469 --> 11:10.990
could change that. But I think for America to have 
New York's not going to hold up. I just don't think

11:20.170 --> 11:21.271
it's going to make it. It's on the downhill slide. 
The whole East Coast is so wrapped up in labor

11:24.334 --> 11:37.487
problems of wading through those issues in the 
next decade or two in the time frame before the

11:24.334 --> 11:37.487
window of opportunity closes as the world 
changes. I don't see it happening on the East

11:37.507 --> 11:39.228
Coast. When guys like Mitch Eggers call me up from 
MIT Lincoln and say, I've got to get out of here, I

11:47.279 --> 11:50.024
pay attention to that. And the West Coast, the 
environmental issues there are going to be so

11:50.044 --> 12:02.265
similar to the difficulty to deal with on the West 
Coast, which are the two logical other places. I

12:02.806 --> 12:11.802
mean, if you were coming into Earth and you were 
looking at North America and you'd never landed

12:02.806 --> 12:11.802
here and you were looking at just what we now call 
North America, or where you would land. Just think

12:14.180 --> 12:15.102
about it. What would guide your thoughts of where 
you'd want to sit down and maybe try to establish a

12:15.122 --> 12:21.656
colony? Texas is a pretty damn natural place. I 
mean, it's got all this coast. It's all that neat

12:24.923 --> 12:28.531
little gulf water body down there. It's a... And 
once you're here and you kind of see the people and

12:31.660 --> 12:40.933
the attitude and where people can take on a vision 
like a George Mitchell will just say, hell, that's

12:31.660 --> 12:40.933
good, let's do it. I mean, we just hit another one, 
you know. I mean, after you bring in a $6 billion

12:44.198 --> 12:49.906
one, the other ones begin to sound less and less 
overwhelming.

12:52.810 --> 12:59.760
I'm trying to convince myself, I'm trying to share 
this vision in pieces. Rarely do I say it this

13:02.055 --> 13:05.300
aggressively.

13:08.204 --> 13:25.410
But I've come to do it more and more lately because 
it's bold enough to either make the listener say,

13:08.204 --> 13:25.410
that guy is absolutely crazy, or I wonder if that 
might just be doable. And I'm looking for those

13:26.065 --> 13:29.549
that say, hmm, that might be doable. And I'm not 
worried about those that say that guy is

13:29.609 --> 13:34.074
absolutely crazy. Because it is doable, and 
furthermore, we don't have a choice. We have to do

13:38.439 --> 13:39.680
it. And there's enough power and wealth and belief 
in the individual, and there's enough basis of

13:41.863 --> 13:53.036
strength if we'll work together. And heart 
provides that mechanism. opportunity for it to

13:55.445 --> 13:58.288
happen. My biggest problem has been patience with 
myself.

14:04.435 --> 14:13.025
To recognize how difficult this is for the 
institutions working with HAARC to even begin to

14:04.435 --> 14:13.025
get their arms around how they can use it. The 
institution that's been far and away the most

14:13.045 --> 14:18.491
intelligent about taking advantage of HAARC is 
Rice. Boy, they've just, they're smart. And it's

14:23.637 --> 14:24.177
natural. They're smaller. Again, they're 
private. They're private. They aren't

14:30.154 --> 14:33.277
constrained by what the governor thinks. They can 
just do it. And that is so powerful. And so I'm

14:40.466 --> 14:53.042
trying to just keep the fuel on the heart fire, 
trying to keep a realistic expectation about the

14:40.466 --> 14:53.042
progress we can make in the next six months or a year 
but not lose the vision of where we can be in a

14:53.242 --> 14:57.447
decade. Because that's what I've got to keep my eye 
on and keep encouraging the larger community and

14:57.467 --> 15:07.200
trying to enlarge that community to catch that 
vision and that belief.

15:10.945 --> 15:17.494
I'm encouraged to maintain that because I'm not 
sure George Mitchell shares that. I'm almost sure

15:18.935 --> 15:20.177
he doesn't. When I speak like this to George, he 
kind of cuts off real fast at some different

15:20.680 --> 15:26.428
boundaries. But if George sees it on a smaller 
scale, and that's a fallback, safer, more

15:27.630 --> 15:41.629
realistic position than my larger global view, 
then that just reinforces me to hold on to the

15:27.630 --> 15:41.629
bigger one. Because if we don't reach mine and we 
reach George's, that ain't going to be bad,

15:42.410 --> 15:46.836
whatever his is. I don't have as good a feeling. for 
what that one might turn out to be because I'm so

15:50.380 --> 16:05.903
confident about the bigger one that whatever that 
other one is, and I recognize that that's more

15:50.380 --> 16:05.903
likely the one we'll achieve, that'll be OK. I 
mean, I've already known that how I thought we

16:05.923 --> 16:13.314
might get to where we are is very different than the 
way we've done it. But I've grown up in the

16:13.655 --> 16:15.758
laboratory. I've never gone in to discover 
something empirically as an experimental

16:19.608 --> 16:28.340
scientist or engineer that I've discovered what I 
thought I was going to get or the way I thought I was

16:19.608 --> 16:28.340
going to do it. You have to roll with the changes as 
they occur. And so Hark's an experiment. It's just

16:32.485 --> 16:33.326
like going in. What are your greatest stumbling 
blocks that you could conceivably anticipate in

16:33.346 --> 16:48.366
terms of creating problems for your vision for 
continuation and expansion of Hark?

16:49.477 --> 17:03.577
And I guess a related question, are you at, let's 
say, a viable level now where art can survive in and

16:49.477 --> 17:03.577
of itself as an ongoing institution and idea and 
concept? We are at the cusp of that energy state or

17:03.597 --> 17:11.348
that level.

17:14.893 --> 17:19.399
I think it would be real hard to kill this 
institution. That's

17:19.767 --> 17:24.853
clearly a milestone. Yeah, oh yeah. No matter who 
you are or why you wanted to, if you came after it,

17:26.174 --> 17:36.687
it'd be real tough to kill it. It says that you have 
both patronage out there now, Bryce, for example,

17:36.707 --> 17:42.954
and then some of the institutions. And the 
independent strength of the institution itself

17:43.274 --> 17:48.340
is really coming on. If what I see is going to happen 
in the next 18 months happens, then my answer would

17:50.530 --> 17:59.658
be an unequivocal no way. If I walked out of here, 
and George walked out of here, and some meaningful

18:01.059 --> 18:10.227
forces wanted to kill the institution, it might be 
doable. But it wouldn't be easy. Even at that? Even

18:12.850 --> 18:13.390
at that. Because that's the question . Yeah. In 18 
months, If what I see is going to happen happens,

18:20.045 --> 18:26.091
George and I both can walk out of here and you can't 
kill it. This thing is gone just like... Now, is it

18:26.111 --> 18:30.936
fair to ask you what this is and what might happen? 
Yeah, it's fair to ask if you want to ask. But I won't

18:33.178 --> 18:34.099
answer it. I can't answer it.

18:38.964 --> 18:42.387
Well, that's exciting. I'll watch. It's...

18:51.365 --> 18:55.532
It's kind of like rearing a child, which you and I 
have both done. And you say, can I really just let

18:56.654 --> 19:02.865
that kid cry through the night and not get up and go 
in there and check on him?

19:05.910 --> 19:13.643
Can we turn it out in the street alone on its bicycle 
and say, come home by such and such time and... You

19:14.737 --> 19:17.961
know, you worry a little, but you finally decide 
you've got to do that. And it's kind of a low. And

19:20.063 --> 19:23.347
after they've done it four or five times, you know, 
you don't even think about it anymore. And if they

19:23.368 --> 19:29.074
come home an hour late and say, oh, hell, they're 
all right, they just somehow had a, you know. We

19:30.616 --> 19:32.539
aren't changing as diapers anymore. And it's 
already learned to crawl. It may even be walking.

19:37.745 --> 19:40.368
And it's beginning to run a little. So it's 
maturing.

19:44.386 --> 19:48.391
I'm not ready, and I don't know that I ever will be. 
This is the most challenging job I've ever had of

19:49.352 --> 19:51.775
any. It's the most difficult. It's also the most 
satisfying and potentially the most rewarding

19:55.739 --> 20:01.446
and meaningful. I'd love to leave this 
organization in an unusually healthy condition

20:02.287 --> 20:10.036
for somebody to come in and carry on. And I plan to do 
that.

20:16.280 --> 20:23.789
I think that could be accomplished

20:16.280 --> 20:23.789
in the next decade. In the next 18 months, if the 
things I see could happen do come to pass,

20:24.530 --> 20:36.764
I don't know how mature the institution would be. 
But I don't think you could run it off. You'd take a

20:41.289 --> 20:45.274
lot of effort and a lot of dumb moves to kill it. and 
with any sustaining support from a larger

20:45.727 --> 20:49.832
community. See, this institution has no 
constituency. None. Zero. There's no alumni.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.822
Nobody knows about it. We're willing this thing 
into life.

21:05.591 --> 21:14.502
But once it makes a contribution that's clearly 
defined as it's, contribution in a broader public

21:15.308 --> 21:18.031
sense. That'll do it. It's done that enough 
already that we're beginning to build some

21:21.294 --> 21:27.401
interest and some curiosity. Unawareness is a 
good word. But see, the story I told you just now

21:29.783 --> 21:42.717
about the Super Climber, even if it's well 
understood, it's not recognized the role Hart

21:29.783 --> 21:42.717
played in bringing that to Texas. And nobody 
really knows how the supertiner got to Texas. But

21:47.568 --> 21:52.935
we just assumed it had to be something

21:47.568 --> 21:52.935
magical. I mean, did the governor do it? Not only 
that, I've mentioned that to people and they

21:54.537 --> 21:57.922
scoff. It's sort of like, that's not what's going 
on. There's people down there reading their own

22:00.665 --> 22:02.768
press releases. Yeah, sure. You bet. That's 
right. And see, that's understandable. I mean,

22:07.815 --> 22:09.497
how could that have happened there? But even if you 
don't know where it happened, it just couldn't

22:10.861 --> 22:17.967
have happened there because, I mean, it was too 
young, it was too immature, it couldn't have

22:10.861 --> 22:17.967
possibly done all that. Well, when reality is, in 
part of historical fact, that's what happened.

22:25.334 --> 22:28.757
And it's not, I mean, it's not a matter of 
conjecture. It's easily proved in documentable

22:29.037 --> 22:31.500
evidence. But

22:31.560 --> 22:40.648
until you reach some perception level, Reality 
doesn't have anything to do with this. It's

22:42.663 --> 22:45.746
perception. That's right. And then you just have 
to live with it. So you just have to let that go by.

22:49.731 --> 22:52.073
And those scoffers don't know the answer. They 
just know what the answer couldn't be. Speaking of

22:55.116 --> 23:02.404
which, do you have access to the public relations 
staff, whatever, that Mr. Mitchell used? Oh,

23:02.705 --> 23:03.025
sure. I mean, are they integral elements? Because 
what you're saying is very true, not just for Hart,

23:07.150 --> 23:11.074
but for any entrepreneurial endeavor. You have to 
develop visibility. You have to develop an image,

23:14.254 --> 23:17.057
a public perception. Well, it's been a matter of 
delicate balance to know when I could take

23:18.138 --> 23:35.340
advantage of Mitchell Energy and Development's 
PR and when I couldn't. One of the curiosities of

23:35.360 --> 23:39.525
learning this city for me Because I was a newcomer 
to Houston in January of 85. Nobody knew who I was

23:43.819 --> 23:52.687
either, except a few Aggies,

23:43.819 --> 23:52.687
who did a magnificent job of introducing me into 
the community. But one of the things that I learned

23:53.868 --> 24:00.295
early on is that George Mitchell is bigger than 
life in Houston. And the Woodlands was not

24:00.315 --> 24:08.162
conceived or presented, but

24:09.003 --> 24:14.850
as a part of Houston, but it was the woodlands. And 
the biggest hurdle I've had to jump in Houston is

24:14.870 --> 24:36.398
the barrier of the fact that HARC is in the 
woodlands, and it's a George Mitchell

24:14.870 --> 24:36.398
enterprise, and that HARC was created to sell dirt 
in the woodlands. Yeah. Okay. So if I go to the

24:38.281 --> 25:05.487
foundation downtown Houston and ask for support 
or endorsement for Hart, they don't want to be seen

24:38.281 --> 25:05.487
in Houston as having been duped by Mitchell or 
Mitchell Energy or George Mitchell individually

24:38.281 --> 25:05.487
into helping him pay for his deal, which was his 
alone, either for his own image and recognition or

24:38.281 --> 25:05.487
for his profit or both. And so if I call up the PR 
people at Mitchell Energy and have them contact

25:07.373 --> 25:25.052
the Post or the News, then when they get called by 
the Mitchell PR people, it just reinforces that

25:07.373 --> 25:25.052
HARC is just an instrument. So that's one of those 
perceptions out there. Well, sure. And I have to be

25:27.355 --> 25:28.876
very careful about that. And many times I have to 
lose out on the opportunity because I don't have

25:28.916 --> 25:36.925
the staff and the depth and the knowledge and 
experience in HARC's PR. See, I didn't start out

25:38.963 --> 25:47.772
immediately to pull together a PR office, a 
communications office, because I thought, heck,

25:38.963 --> 25:47.772
I can just use Mitchell's. It's already paid for, 
and I can tap into it. And in six months, I realized I

25:51.315 --> 25:57.781
was shooting heart right through the heart. And it 
didn't matter how much I had to say about it, it's

25:57.801 --> 26:00.904
true. Perception becomes reality, particularly 
if you reinforce it by using those pawns. Oh, it's

26:05.989 --> 26:06.810
going to be true. And so, and it's been some source 
of frustration to George, because he got all this

26:07.094 --> 26:17.304
talent that's paid for, and he knows they know what 
to do, and he knows they're good, and why don't you

26:07.094 --> 26:17.304
use them? And I said, George, I can't. And I said, 
because it reinforces the fact that HARC works for

26:20.007 --> 26:26.133
you, is owned by you. And you know, George, that's 
not the case. I work for the HARC board, and HARC is

26:31.238 --> 26:35.262
owned by HARC. a non-profit private 
organization, as he well knows. But Hark has the

26:40.230 --> 26:48.059
benefit of George Mitchell being on our board and 
of George Mitchell being the angel of Hark. George

26:48.800 --> 26:53.126
Mitchell gave 100 acres of his land to Hark. He has 
put in cash money in the five years, now it's almost

26:53.146 --> 27:02.397
six years I have been here, about $20 million. So

27:07.225 --> 27:20.084
George's net contribution to HARC is 100 acres of 
land worth $10 million plus $20 million in cash in

27:07.225 --> 27:20.084
six years. But if the perception out in the street 
is that, in fact, this is a tool of another

27:22.788 --> 27:31.802
developer to sell land, as you suggested. That is 
the perception. Yeah. Yeah, I see what you're

27:35.384 --> 27:36.605
talking about. That's it. And the reality is, and 
the way I now address that issue, is your heart is

27:38.407 --> 27:49.399
going to help sell dirt in the wilderness. It's 
going to be the best research institution of its

27:49.419 --> 27:54.444
kind in the world, and people are going to want to be 
close to it. We've already got some of the

27:55.205 --> 28:02.433
brightest and best people you can find in the world 
in their discipline that can be anywhere in the

27:55.205 --> 28:02.433
world they want to be, and they want to be at heart. 
Now tell me what that means. There's nobody here

28:06.400 --> 28:11.527
that doesn't have a choice anywhere they want to 
be. That's certainly an answer. So why are they

28:14.691 --> 28:15.893
here? Well, a lot of different reasons, but in 
every case they're here because they want to be.

28:23.002 --> 28:29.691
And

28:23.002 --> 28:29.691
they are not here to sell dirt in the woodlands. 
They don't understand real estate. They don't

28:31.213 --> 28:32.635
care about real estate. These are scientific 
people. who are looking for something different

28:35.155 --> 28:48.927
than what the traditional academic, government, 
or industry pieces of society from which they've

28:35.155 --> 28:48.927
come, and from which every one of us have had 
experience in at least two of those three. And this

28:49.648 --> 28:53.031
is different, and it's exciting, and it's where we 
want to be. And so we're not here primarily to help

28:55.013 --> 29:01.739
the woodlands. Sure, the woodlands is going to 
benefit from this, but we can't help that.

29:06.526 --> 29:12.653
Wherever you put us as a team, that community is 
going to benefit. But so is Houston. So is Clear

29:14.475 --> 29:15.837
Lake. So is Texas. So is America. So let's don't get 
too picky here. And just because the guy that

29:21.163 --> 29:30.133
happens to own that dirt out there is going to 
benefit, take a look at what he has done

29:21.163 --> 29:30.133
individually. He's not going to get a return on $30 
million in his lifetime. by selling dirt in the

29:35.467 --> 29:38.972
woodlands, and he's already put that into harking 
five years. Come on. Grow up. Get up on the level

29:41.496 --> 29:45.502
here of doing something for the state and the 
nation. You know, a journalist would understand

29:45.763 --> 29:47.205
that. Have you, you know, the man on the street is 
going to understand the angle. Yeah. Right? I

29:52.453 --> 29:54.916
mean, and not only that, but Mitchell's the one 
with the visibility. He's the one that they shoot

29:54.936 --> 29:56.899
at, right? Yeah. But a journalist ought to be 
smarter than that, especially a business

29:58.762 --> 30:02.588
journalist or a... well see I think it's begun to 
diffuse and I've been saying it this way now for the

30:03.547 --> 30:33.115
last two years where I believe those that but but we 
still have a park institutionally hasn't matured

30:03.547 --> 30:33.115
and become important enough for them to say all 
those people are reading their own press down

30:03.547 --> 30:33.115
there that's not the way it happened I mean they 
don't know what's going on out there and it didn't

30:03.547 --> 30:33.115
really interesting enough intellectually to 
take the time to really go find that now when we hit

30:03.547 --> 30:33.115
that and we're coming We're coming hell-bent for 
leather. And this institution is about to break

30:35.781 --> 30:40.247
through that barrier. So it will be a barrier. The 
perception, the world's perception will change.

30:43.972 --> 30:45.515
That's the barrier. That's right. But for the 
perception to change, their interest in who are

30:46.316 --> 30:57.292
they has to get up another notch for them to get 
interested enough to, by God, come answer, come

30:46.316 --> 30:57.292
ask the question. And when they do, I think they 
will go away with the answer. And all of a sudden...

31:01.883 --> 31:11.412
That other stuff will just dissipate like fog in 
the wind, and it'll just be part of the history of

31:01.883 --> 31:11.412
Hark. And you just have to wait and not focus on that 
and let that eat you up. Just go where you're going.

31:19.019 --> 31:20.220
Keep your vision clear. Keep doing those things 
that lead you there, and one day, you'll bust

31:20.360 --> 31:28.147
through that barrier, and all these people will 
show up and say, well, golly, what have you guys

31:20.360 --> 31:28.147
been doing? Well, tell me, did you really do that, 
Super Collider? Is this thing really not a deal to

31:31.718 --> 31:34.782
sell dirt in the woodlands? Oh, well, how isn't it? 
Well, gee, now I see it. And then all of a sudden, the

31:38.486 --> 31:43.052
community will start saying, that's a wonderful 
asset. That's a tool we need to be using. Just to get

31:45.895 --> 31:48.818
endorsement. I mean, there was a resistance in 
this community even in Dorsark. I was asked twice

31:55.326 --> 32:01.033
personally to travel in Japan with Kathy 
Whitmire. to speak technical, and we needed some

32:01.655 --> 32:07.281
Houstonian who knew how to speak technical, so 
Houston would look technical. Yet to go to the city

32:09.223 --> 32:31.628
and start asking the mayor in talks to mention 
HAARC as an asset in Houston like Rice or like

32:09.223 --> 32:31.628
University of Houston, from which he graduated, 
or talk about the medical center and talk about

32:09.223 --> 32:31.628
this new, exciting, important asset that's 
forthcoming in the future of Houston. the Houston

32:31.895 --> 32:51.354
Advanced Research Center, in selected times when 
it was important, because maybe I was in the

32:31.895 --> 32:51.354
audience or George was or somebody they knew 
needed to hear that, but to really think of it in any

32:31.895 --> 32:51.354
generic way that we got to talk about this thing 
coming, and it's part of our future, and we're all

32:31.895 --> 32:51.354
nurturing it. It's a new grandbaby. But, you know, 
I think even NASA has gone through that. Sure.

32:57.620 --> 32:58.341
Remarkably, isn't it? Houston sort of blocked 
NASA out, especially during good times. I know. I

33:02.759 --> 33:04.241
know it just because. And really in bad times, they 
began to turn back. That's right. Well, what David

33:07.945 --> 33:14.712
did with the partners in space thing, see, I mean, 
that's helped a lot. So in that sense, Houston is an

33:16.674 --> 33:20.318
interesting community. It's much more like a free 
trade zone than it is a community

33:20.899 --> 33:27.045
in that sense. I think Dallas, while it's harder to 
break into Dallas as a citizen of the community

33:27.582 --> 33:35.250
than, say, in Houston, Houston's open. You roll in 
here, put together a company, and start

33:35.851 --> 33:43.359
performing, you're part of the leadership of the 
town. And it's much better in Dallas if your great

33:45.081 --> 33:49.266
granddaddy did something there. It's much more 
like the old South, like trying to break into

33:49.286 --> 33:56.053
Atlanta, the in crowd. Houston, hell, you blow in 
here and do deals. I mean, George Bush and Bob

33:58.475 --> 34:05.843
Mosbacher can come in here right out of Yankee land 
and end up in the leadership of the city. And it's

34:06.644 --> 34:20.999
wide open and aggressive here, but I've said this 
on more than one occasion, is that that creates an

34:06.644 --> 34:20.999
opportunity on one side, but it's a deficit on 
another because where's the leadership? Where's

34:21.580 --> 34:22.581
the core group that can just decide we're going to 
make this happen. And anoint you. And it's hard to

34:29.293 --> 34:31.136
get your arms around that. And right now in this 
city, it doesn't exist in my judgment. There's not

34:37.024 --> 34:51.825
anybody that has a real clear vision of where 
Houston is going on the world scene, how it's going

34:37.024 --> 34:51.825
to lead in America, what's going to be, who's going 
to be living here and what are they going to be doing

34:37.024 --> 34:51.825
in 20 years and how will it work and why will it be 
important. as a leading global city. It's almost

34:56.496 --> 35:00.742
assured that oil will not be what it is 20 years from 
now. Neither will cotton or cow. And where is the

35:03.626 --> 35:06.110
wealth going to come from? And if the city and the 
state doesn't invest in its educational systems,

35:07.492 --> 35:20.952
if it doesn't keep and improve its research base at 
NASA, at the Super Collider, There are

35:21.843 --> 35:32.655
universities, and if it doesn't, establish some 
new links, particularly HARC, which is the first

35:21.843 --> 35:32.655
effort. And this institution and this city 
happens to be now six years out in front of any other

35:32.675 --> 35:42.306
because we've just got six years' leap of figuring 
out how to play this game. HARC becomes the trailer

35:43.267 --> 35:49.234
hitch that hooks these three pieces to the 
changing global economy that permits academic

35:49.872 --> 35:57.922
and industry to work more closely together in a 
comfortable way. And the closest thing I've come

35:59.845 --> 36:19.390
to, at the encouragement of one of my board 
members, Paul Howell, is our battle cry, as he

35:59.845 --> 36:19.390
calls it, is the Houston Advanced Research Center 
linking science and technology to the

35:59.845 --> 36:19.390
marketplace.

36:21.023 --> 36:22.664
So I don't know how to... I need help, and I would 
hope, and I would ask, request, that as you guys

36:24.106 --> 36:42.382
kind of listen to all this, because this will be 
quite an educational experience for me from you as

36:24.106 --> 36:42.382
you learn from a completely different 
perspective, not having been nearly as close to it

36:24.106 --> 36:42.382
as I've been. You can look at this with fresh eyes 
and fresh perspective, and I'd love to have your

36:43.063 --> 36:50.710
recommendations, your suggestions, your 
thoughts on if what I've been saying rings any

36:51.601 --> 36:59.070
resonant card of reality with what you think the 
future holds. That's good. Yeah, I think we might

36:59.590 --> 37:06.899
be able to respond a little bit to that, especially 
having been in the academic climate or being there

36:59.590 --> 37:06.899
now. And dealing with NASA is kind of intriguing. 
I'm very concerned about the transition in

37:09.021 --> 37:14.508
technology and this kind of startup industries. 
So I know what you're doing. It's fascinating. And

37:17.752 --> 37:20.595
this has really been a very good description and 
development of effort. And I think now it helps

37:25.330 --> 37:31.615
define relationships with Hart, the Woodlands, 
George Mitchell. And yourself in general, the

37:31.635 --> 37:37.140
future here, what do you apply now? Well, I've been 
impressed

37:37.160 --> 37:50.312
in the open-mindedness I've found in George. 
particularly. When I've known,

37:53.625 --> 38:00.273
I've just known he wished I'd have done it another 
way.

38:04.737 --> 38:16.030
When I felt how I could have done it in a way that 
would have probably brought, in the short run, a

38:17.157 --> 38:46.050
lot more value to the woodlands

38:17.157 --> 38:46.050
and i have been forced

38:17.157 --> 38:46.050
to be aware of the perception of the larger 
community and some of my judgment calls of what

38:17.157 --> 38:46.050
i have to i have to protect hark my job is to protect 
hark that's right and the credibility is The

38:46.908 --> 38:47.869
essence of it. Yeah. And that's a perception. 
That's right. And I refuse, under any

38:50.032 --> 38:55.779
circumstance, to... I mean, that responsibility 
of the president of HARC cannot be for sale. Under

39:04.290 --> 39:16.746
any circumstance, there can be nothing that could 
lure me to ever make a decision that wasn't in

39:04.290 --> 39:16.746
HARC's best long-term interest. Look, you don't 
launch something like this for a short-term gain.

39:23.742 --> 39:26.064
You're not going to get any short-term gain. This 
is a long-term deal. We're talking decades.

39:29.688 --> 39:38.378
Whoever follows me in this job should have a much 
easier time. Different. It'll be hard. It's

39:40.179 --> 39:41.020
always hard. But it'll be a different set. I mean, 
if I were running a major university, that with a

39:48.046 --> 40:06.230
long tradition, running Texas A&M, for example, 
or running the Engineering Experiment Station

39:48.046 --> 40:06.230
had a much different set of forces and 
complexities to it than starting an institution

39:48.046 --> 40:06.230
that never existed. In the one hand, it's damn 
delightful not to have a constituency out there

40:06.251 --> 40:13.360
that can tell you how they think you ought to be 
doing your job. On the other hand, if you don't have

40:14.041 --> 40:17.766
any constituency, who do you turn to for help? when 
you need it. And so there's some positives and

40:19.561 --> 40:22.585
negatives to both sides of it. So, but in 20 or 30 
years, Park

40:23.987 --> 40:41.090
could be a major force for Texas and maybe America. 
And that

40:41.110 --> 40:46.437
would be incredibly fast. That really would. 
Well, you've done a lot fast already. About five or

40:49.349 --> 40:52.273
six years for an institution. Yeah. That's just 
getting . You could actually go faster than that.

40:57.558 --> 40:59.240
Because there's a multiplier effect. If you've 
got some positive publicity showing up in

40:59.260 --> 41:04.726
visibility, it matters. Yes, that's right. 
People may not even think of you because they don't

41:05.907 --> 41:09.491
even know you exist now. But you hit a home run, and 
suddenly your name's in the papers. Well, I

41:15.408 --> 41:23.238
frustrated a lot of the people that would have had 
us go after that kind of recognition early on.

41:26.463 --> 41:37.958
And I've got another fundamental gut feel that I 
follow, particularly in this state, is don't do

41:26.463 --> 41:37.958
too much talking before you've done some doing. 
Good Texas logic. You bet, yeah. Let's do a little

41:42.340 --> 41:44.122
and then talk. And talk is all right as long as it 
isn't brag if it's just fact. And I didn't want to

41:49.628 --> 42:04.624
rally a lot of press and a lot of visibility in PR to 
talk about the new institution that's going to do

41:49.628 --> 42:04.624
something and going to deliver all this wonderful 
stuff for Texas and for America, et cetera, et

41:49.628 --> 42:04.624
cetera. What I wanted to do was get some pelts on the 
wall and get some credibility, that you could talk

42:09.847 --> 42:13.272
about those. And then if you could put those 
together, you could begin to build the projection

42:13.553 --> 42:19.582
of where you could go. And we have just hit that. Now 
we've got it. And now I'm ready to bring that

42:24.390 --> 42:38.031
attention to us because we can talk specifically, 
factually, documentively about several very

42:24.390 --> 42:38.031
exciting issues that we've done. And we've done it 
in five years. And that's for two reasons.

42:46.401 --> 42:53.087
One is that we do have unusually talented people 
here that want to be here. And I'll never discount

42:54.508 --> 43:02.636
the effort that these people are pouring into 
breathing life into this dream. They're working

43:02.656 --> 43:04.778
hard and they're making it happen. The other is 
that it's at a time in the evolution of the country

43:05.669 --> 43:17.562
and of the world where the opportunity to make an 
impact fast has never been better. I think it was

43:18.042 --> 43:23.108
harder for SRI in 1920s to get started. There 
wasn't nearly the screaming need. I mean, we were

43:25.050 --> 43:26.992
self-sufficient. We were self-sustained as a 
nation. We had an unusual period. We were king of

43:31.197 --> 43:32.318
the hill in that time. And now there's a greater 
need for an institution like ours. And so it can

43:36.369 --> 43:37.851
move faster. So if you've got good people working 
hard, you can get a leveraged effect. And I think

43:41.335 --> 43:43.538
that's happening. So I'm proud of the people and 
the work that they're putting in and the

43:43.558 --> 43:48.504
contribution they've made. And I think we're 
doing it at maybe one of the last opportunistic

43:48.584 --> 43:56.654
times to get it done where you can leverage. 
Because if the country waits much longer to

43:56.674 --> 44:02.541
address the gut-level issues that we have of How 
many bright people do we really have left? What is

44:06.654 --> 44:08.416
the quality of our education? What kind of workers 
are we turning out? What do we know how to do with the

44:11.300 --> 44:17.447
ideas of the people that are capable of producing 
them? How do we understand how the rest of the world

44:17.487 --> 44:22.753
is changing, and do we link to it, and what's our 
mechanism for doing that? All of those issues in

44:23.694 --> 44:28.360
some real kind of complex way, Park is embracing. 
not just the standard we do teaching service and

44:28.964 --> 44:34.174
basic research. We need to continue that. We have 
to focus on that, enhance it, and improve it. But if

44:39.364 --> 44:46.919
we do all of that without doing a heart and having 
this new tool, you can't fix it. You're one tool

44:47.760 --> 44:51.327
short of being able to work on the problem. And so 
that's part of what I think the vision of ARC has to

44:52.555 --> 45:02.689
be, and it has to be captured somehow that way. And I 
keep reaching for these different parables,

45:03.711 --> 45:19.373
these different ways of saying it, where it can be 
understood by at least the above average person on

45:03.711 --> 45:19.373
the street interested in where the country's 
going to be able to go. I don't know what's going to

45:20.675 --> 45:22.377
happen in this budget. situation in Washington 
right now. These guys aren't dealing with the

45:25.184 --> 45:26.668
problem. They don't know how. It made me so upset. 
It's embarrassing to be from this country right

45:31.180 --> 45:36.535
now.
