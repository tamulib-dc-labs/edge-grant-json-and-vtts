I was getting to go home from, from my school 
check-in, but they didn't tell me that, um, the

30:40.638 --> 31:01.908
first thing they told me was that he was actually a 
suspect in Florida. Um, they said that they wanted

31:01.928 --> 31:04.432
to tell us that, and, uh, he wanted to, you know, do 
that for a while, and I couldn't see him. I was

31:04.452 --> 31:05.413
there, and I went, and I never, I never... Thank

31:05.393 --> 31:22.626

37:36.151 --> 37:49.402
the fact that he was on your head at the beginning of 
the first day of the month, do you know what you're

37:36.151 --> 37:49.402
talking to me? Do you really have to tell me the 
rest? And how, you know, I see a few things up in

37:50.224 --> 37:51.206
here. I'm going to tell you a few things about this 
program. I'm going to tell you a few things about

38:10.694 --> 38:28.824
I've been out, um, since, since I've been here, 
since before I've, I've been out on people.

38:28.844 --> 38:31.408
They're helping me because they're, they're not 
doing their online, they're working all the

38:28.844 --> 38:31.408
hours, and that, and that, and that. Um, it's hard 
to talk to them, and I've got that on there. So, you

38:32.610 --> 38:33.452
know, that's what I'm going to do. If you're going 
to do your online, it's all too good, and I, I, I'm

38:33.472 --> 38:35.335
not going to be doing it. Thank

38:35.315 --> 38:51.349
you. Or a

38:51.329 --> 39:06.560
fusion

38:51.329 --> 39:06.560
chemical, or a lot of other things. You know, it 
makes me feel like I have a relationship with you

39:06.580 --> 39:07.923
now. And there's a lot of stuff in your body. But I 
think of it as I'm here. But things go on, and I can't

39:09.466 --> 39:10.227
see. I'm there in half years. Whoa. So I'm able to 
control my body. And the only thing I want is for the

body to be. Okay.

45:48.935 --> 46:08.445
me about two and a half days to lay me down on the 
floor and lay me down on the floor and lay me down on

45:48.935 --> 46:08.445
the floor and lay me down on the floor and lay me 
down. And

46:08.425 --> 46:33.253
then I was like, oh, no way. And then I was like, oh, I 
had no idea. And then I was like, oh, I had no idea.

52:21.700 --> 52:43.742
you. My

52:43.722 --> 52:55.800
dad was just a little bit older than I was. It was 
great. I love it. I mean, I've heard the case. I'm

52:56.902 --> 52:57.483
sure I've seen it before. You've seen it now. I 
mean, I've tried to look. It was tough when I first

52:58.464 --> 52:59.265
got that case. I mean, it's kind of a crazy thing. 
I've learned it a lot before. I've seen it a lot. .

01:01:13.651 --> 01:01:28.858
if you think there's an absolute cost, we have an 
answer to that, and we don't have to worry about

01:01:13.651 --> 01:01:28.858
that. If you have an absolute cost, we can all just 
do those things, work over it, and we can all try to

01:01:28.878 --> 01:01:31.423
bring these things together. um

01:01:50.675 --> 01:02:19.290
