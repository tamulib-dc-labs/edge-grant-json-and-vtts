WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:09.133
Acting dean for a year and then Mews is hired as the 
dean and you are the associate dean. Associate

00:09.153 --> 00:12.297
dean for graduate programs and research. 
Alright, by then how big was the business program?

00:16.982 --> 00:17.442
It's growing. Yeah, it's huge by then. It's now 
getting ready to get the blocker, well the next,

00:19.344 --> 00:31.337
the year following it gets, well as a matter of fact 
they moved in right after I replaced you. So I

00:34.598 --> 00:46.074
stayed until I guess May as associate dean or 
April, but I remember once they decided I was to do

00:34.598 --> 00:46.074
it. You left early as I recall, didn't you? July 1. I 
thought you left earlier than that. July 1, 1970. I

00:53.464 --> 00:57.510
mean 1980, excuse me. Well, in any event, I guess I 
was supposed to serve until the end of August, and I

00:58.098 --> 01:05.449
left. Originally, it was going to be August, and I 
said, no, let me get out there and get my feet on the

01:05.610 --> 01:10.177
ground. Which is a good thing to do. If I had to do it 
over again, I'd do it the same way. Mews had been a

01:15.445 --> 01:18.790
department head. And dean of a little college in 
West Virginia. And then came here. You chaired the

01:25.435 --> 01:26.957
committee. Yes, yes. I was on it. Describe him as 
dean. He did a good job. He sat down with every

01:33.666 --> 01:45.081
member of the faculty, came in early as I recall, 
and did that.

01:47.423 --> 01:56.592
did start planning for further growth and 
particularly quality growth. I think he

01:56.612 --> 02:11.786
instituted a number of procedures that got other 
people's attention because not too long after he

01:56.612 --> 02:11.786
was made a deputy chancellor. Were there any key 
decisions you recall that really helped to

02:17.545 --> 02:43.806
determine the growth and progress of business 
under in those years i think the i don't remember

02:17.545 --> 02:43.806
key decisions i remember uh that we had some pretty 
good department heads and the money was flowing

02:17.545 --> 02:43.806
and um enrollment was skyrocketing and 
enrollment was women were flocking into

02:46.115 --> 02:49.019
particularly accounting. Even then, close to 
half of the enrollees in the accounting program

02:49.079 --> 02:58.732
were females. So, of course, there's no question 
but what the role of females on this campus made a

03:00.515 --> 03:07.404
major difference. Can you give any examples that 
you recall of the real world out there showing

03:11.647 --> 03:19.345
their acceptance of the progress of A&M? Do you 
remember any businesses changing their policy

03:19.385 --> 03:25.840
about hiring A&M people or anything? Well, first 
of all, in past years not necessarily from the

03:30.496 --> 03:49.855
business program but from the college petroleum 
engineering people and so forth had succeeded to

03:30.496 --> 03:49.855
pretty important positions presidencies in many 
cases and uh... people like bill adams and before

03:30.496 --> 03:49.855
him bill eckles worked hard at developing the 
Aggie ties with these people for the executive

03:50.881 --> 03:57.816
development program. So I think the executive 
development program played a non-trivial role

04:06.507 --> 04:10.631
and getting business people on campus. And you 
know this as well as I do, when they hit the campus

04:11.072 --> 04:21.162
they just awed by the quality, the character of the 
students, the friendliness of the place. And of

04:22.804 --> 04:32.374
course this was during the Vietnam War times and 
there weren't major uprisings on our campus. We

04:32.454 --> 04:33.375
were the model from a conservative businessman's 
point of view. We were the model of decorum. The

04:42.196 --> 04:50.443
story was that the only time the students marched 
on the president's house, on Jack Williams'

04:42.196 --> 04:50.443
house, was for some. I think to welcome him. To 
welcome him, yeah, that was right. Describe Bill

04:55.948 --> 05:03.615
Mews as dean, his manner, his style.

05:04.777 --> 05:05.559
He was a leader. It was pretty clear that he was a 
leader, but he was a democratic leader. He got

05:09.928 --> 05:21.492
input and basically, I felt really part of the 
program for the 10 months or 11 months that I was his

05:09.928 --> 05:21.492
associate dean. He was innovative. He came out of 
marketing. And so he knew what he needed to do in

05:26.056 --> 05:37.573
terms of, I think he really did do a pretty good job 
of marketing the program nationally. I'm sure he

05:38.214 --> 05:46.767
was effective when he went to meetings such as the 
AACSB's meetings, national meetings. He was an

05:48.850 --> 05:51.854
effective recruiter. Did we have, did you all have 
a business program somewhere else that you kind of

05:55.199 --> 05:59.185
used as a model?

06:02.029 --> 06:06.636
Was there any school or schools trying to follow 
that pattern?

06:09.860 --> 06:12.144
No, I can't remember that we really did. It would be 
worth asking Bill about if he did. I was only in for a

06:19.297 --> 06:35.888
year, what I did try to do was get some order out of 
what I thought was kind of not the best way, from my

06:19.297 --> 06:35.888
point of view, handling determining salaries and 
things like that for department heads. I had the

06:36.897 --> 06:44.425
whole department head group sit down and review 
all of our salaries.

06:48.009 --> 06:56.779
So you were associate dean for a year and then back 
to the department, or did you stay back to the

06:48.009 --> 06:56.779
department? Well, no, sorry. I was selected to be 
dean of faculties from there. Forgot about it.

07:08.065 --> 07:11.410
Review for me the process, that selection 
process. Well, I debated hemmed and hawed about

07:12.873 --> 07:18.903
whether I would even put my name in the pot. Chuck 
called me and asked me to do it. McCandless.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.832
McCandless, yeah, and I did. And I ended up being 
one of the finalists. There were three, I guess.

07:36.443 --> 07:38.105
Stewart in English, I think.

07:42.050 --> 07:49.700
What's his name in physics, whose wife Carolyn

07:42.050 --> 07:49.700
Adair. Tom Adair. I think he might have been. For 
whatever reason, I got selected. And how did you

07:58.251 --> 08:00.374
learn you'd been selected? Did you get a letter or a 
phone call? I was asked to come over and see Mac

08:03.010 --> 08:05.372
Prescott. Okay. And so you took over in summer of 
80, and

08:07.995 --> 08:23.290
this was- Within a month or two, Jarvis Miller was 
gone. Right. How did you hear that news? Ah, you've

08:26.473 --> 08:29.296
probably heard the story. Hubert had started 
these programs, it's not quite the right word,

08:35.377 --> 08:49.482
events where the board, after its board meeting, 
would go somewhere and meet the faculty and staff

08:35.377 --> 08:49.482
of colleges. We and architecture were at the 
Ramada Inn, and what's his name from? Tyler came

09:00.757 --> 09:06.886
marching in and said, why don't we fire your 
president?

09:09.389 --> 09:13.896
This was said to the first people who happened to 
see him as he came in. And you talk about a grass fire

09:14.577 --> 09:21.246
on a prairie, I mean it just swept through the place 
like Nobody, I don't think anybody, well, I

09:21.800 --> 09:27.667
didn't, certainly had no clue that this was going 
on. I didn't either, and I had left the day before to

09:28.087 --> 09:50.473
drive to, that was a Wednesday, and my wife and I had 
had lunch with Ken and Ann Pierce, veterinary

09:28.087 --> 09:50.473
medicine, old Presbyterian friends, and we left 
Tuesday after lunch, spent the night in Fort

09:28.087 --> 09:50.473
Stockton, got to El Paso Wednesday night, went to 
the president's house to look more carefully at

09:51.517 --> 09:56.102
what it was going to be like. And we got to our motel 
at 1030 Mountain Time, and there was a note there

09:56.763 --> 10:05.714
saying, urgent call Dr. Prescott at President 
Miller's house. And I asked the clerk, and she said

10:06.514 --> 10:11.360
the phone call had come at 730 Mountain Time. So it 
was then three hours later. My wife said, are you

10:13.883 --> 10:15.084
going to call? And I said, no, it's too late. It's 
1130 there. Whatever's done is done. what do you

10:19.917 --> 10:20.898
think happened? Well, I have no idea. But I said, 
this is not Mac Prescott calling to say good luck.

10:26.145 --> 10:27.126
We're wishing you well. I said, this is serious. 
Yeah, it's like a death or something. And I said,

10:30.390 --> 10:34.015
perhaps one of the Miller daughters had an 
accident. Who knows? But then, in attempted

10:35.196 --> 10:38.060
humor, I said, the board's there. Anything's 
possible. By 8 o'clock, By 7 o'clock Mountain

10:42.580 --> 10:59.034
Time, 8 o'clock Central Time, I'd had calls from 
three different newspaper reporters who found me

10:42.580 --> 10:59.034
out there asking for my comment on what had 
happened, and I didn't, until they told me, I

10:42.580 --> 10:59.034
didn't know what had happened. What was the 
general reaction of? Well, a shock.

11:06.981 --> 11:12.165
Most, I don't know how Dean's, generally reacted 
to

11:12.989 --> 11:22.323
how Jarvis Miller functioned as a president. I was 
not impressed myself, particularly he had a

11:22.343 --> 11:28.813
lieutenant who was a political hack. I can't 
remember his name. Steve Pringle. Pringle. I mean

11:32.559 --> 11:40.110
you thought you were talking to a... How did, do you 
remember any of Mack's first Well, Mack, I think,

11:40.715 --> 11:43.799
was appalled. I think he was. Yeah. Because they 
were pretty close. Yes. And, all right, then Chuck

11:50.229 --> 11:57.399
Sampson's appointment as interim was announced 
almost immediately? Yeah. In fact, I think maybe

11:59.702 --> 12:01.545
that night. I'm not sure. But soon thereafter. All 
right. When did – how soon – did Jarvis vacate the

12:08.457 --> 12:12.502
office and Chuck occupied?

12:19.332 --> 12:22.596
Boy, I think it was very quickly. As I recall, 
Jarvis Miller, well, after the event, when he knew

12:22.776 --> 12:34.492
he was fired, he sent notes to everybody but,

12:22.776 --> 12:34.492
what's his name? Weisenbaker. Weisenbaker. And I 
don't know that he came back to the office much

12:40.250 --> 12:47.638
except to clean out the desk. I really don't know. 
Did Mr. Weisenbaker in small talk over there give

12:49.180 --> 12:54.406
any justification or reason or explanation? I 
never talked to him over there. I've never heard. I

12:57.029 --> 12:58.630
just heard it all hearsay. He just said he was 
fired. I understand through very indirect word of

13:01.654 --> 13:08.181
mouth that when they... confronted Jarvis with 
what they had done, that one of them supposedly

13:08.330 --> 13:17.303
said, you refused to shake hands with an A&M 
graduate. Well, I was seated about three feet from

13:18.184 --> 13:37.392
where that happened on the stage at the spring 
commencement, and when we got into the

13:18.184 --> 13:37.392
letterman's lounge where we put on our caps and 
gowns and so forth, I overheard a number of the

13:18.184 --> 13:37.392
board members saying, damn right, serves her 
right, I wouldn't have shaken hands with her

13:18.184 --> 13:37.392
either. I didn't remember anybody that day saying 
that that was bad. I'm trying to remember. I was

13:46.301 --> 13:47.164
there too. Yes, you were. Because I remember. We 
were both on stage. I remember Jarvis. walking

13:53.723 --> 14:02.115
toward Mack's back and doing this, or something 
like that, and Mack had to go up and take his place.

14:02.715 --> 14:05.800
And I'm trying to remember if there was a gasp in the 
audience or not. There were a few people kind of

14:06.621 --> 14:15.794
going, like,

14:06.621 --> 14:15.794
Chuck took over. Did he do, did he have any key 
meetings with you, key people in the first weeks?

14:27.745 --> 14:32.453
He continued the Jarvis Miller breakfast, which 
were what, once a month? I think so. Yeah, although

14:33.816 --> 14:43.312
we backed off from the steak and eggs and 
everything and got down to cereal and toast and

14:33.816 --> 14:43.312
whatnot. Were there still once-a-week

14:46.154 --> 14:50.441
APC meetings? Yes. Of course, those were presided 
over by Mack. Yes, yes. All right, now describe,

14:56.150 --> 15:03.542
make believe that I didn't know Mack's style of 
leadership. Describe Mack Prescott as a chief

15:03.602 --> 15:06.326
academic officer.

15:09.732 --> 15:11.014
Well, you knew where he stood. I don't need to say 
that. I thought he presided well. I mean, he was

15:16.183 --> 15:23.291
crisp, and we took business in order, and I was 
impressed. I liked Mack. What were his, did he have

15:24.433 --> 15:29.920
any pet peeves, foibles? Oh, he would, he got upset 
over, not really upset, but he could get concerned

15:31.562 --> 15:39.972
about... a faculty member who kind of went off the 
deep end on something or other. But he, you know, he

15:46.364 --> 15:49.393
took it in his stride. I enjoyed the the little 
meetings that we had with him which now of course

15:53.924 --> 16:09.426
have grown into health conventions and there's no 
longer the intimacy and decision making that was

15:53.924 --> 16:09.426
really a pleasure in the early years. Oh I can 
remember when you talk about being upset when he

16:11.309 --> 16:20.742
had to trot over to justify the budget with Chuck 
Sampson and the picky little green eye shaded

16:22.156 --> 16:33.069
people were allowed to climb all over this, that, 
or the other little thing. Mack said he almost went

16:34.030 --> 16:46.826
over the table after, who was that jerk that was, 
have to take that out, that person who was an

16:34.030 --> 16:46.826
assistant chancellor over there.

16:49.910 --> 16:50.070
Ah. I think he's finally retired. I don't know. 
Anyway, but he would ask about a secretary's

16:54.759 --> 16:59.865
salary. Talk about picky eunuch. Petty.

17:08.716 --> 17:13.402
Did you notice any changes in direction or 
emphases?

17:16.406 --> 17:18.428
Did anybody under Sampson? No. Not really. I think 
he was really a caretaker. Every night he would go

17:24.932 --> 17:36.764
out with two big briefcases full of stuff, put them 
in the trunk of the Cadillac, and drive home. The

17:37.365 --> 17:38.967
next morning it would take these. Presumably he'd 
signed his name all night long or something. Now,

17:44.553 --> 17:49.858
he quickly occupied the office in the Koch 
building. that Jarvis had offered. Okay. And now

17:53.378 --> 17:57.244
you served from 1980 to 19 what? Ninety. Ninety. So 
you served ten years as dean of faculties. During

18:04.036 --> 18:09.906
that period,

18:04.036 --> 18:09.906
who were the presidents? Will Sampson, of course, 
was replaced by Vandiver. And although he was off

18:15.883 --> 18:20.167
the wall, sometimes he was fun to work with. Then 
who followed him? And he was followed by...

18:21.949 --> 18:24.692
Mobley? Mobley. Okay. Alright, let's talk about 
Vandiver. How did you and others become aware that

18:32.441 --> 18:37.407
Vandiver was under consideration? From Ed 
Cooper. who plotted where the airplane went.

18:49.697 --> 19:03.298
This may have been an after, something we learned 
afterwards, but he did know that the plane went up

18:49.697 --> 19:03.298
to Denton, the University plane with Regents on 
it.

19:06.265 --> 19:09.289
And it happened pretty quickly, as I recall. It 
wasn't much time wasted. Because didn't the board

19:12.854 --> 19:17.220
say that they would have a president by September 
the 1st? Yeah, and they did. Were you and others

19:18.742 --> 19:25.892
aware of whether or not Sampson was even 
considered for the job permanently? No. There

19:27.475 --> 19:29.978
were people who were very upset that he wasn't, but 
I certainly wasn't one of them. I've not heard of

19:32.194 --> 19:34.576
whether he was or wasn't. He was a very nice man. 
Yes. But I imagine he was sort of a Peter Principle

19:36.919 --> 19:43.186
thing. He probably did a good job as head of civil 
engineering. Well, see, and he wasn't even head of

19:47.591 --> 19:51.455
civil engineering at the time he was born. No. No, 
he wasn't. All right. Do you remember how you all

19:59.219 --> 20:03.405
heard that Vandiver was officially the new 
president? No, I don't. I guess it must have been a

20:04.126 --> 20:07.471
phone call to Mack. Describe your first 
impression of him. Of Vandiver? Vandiver. Well, I

20:17.346 --> 20:18.047
liked him. He's a jovial guy. Very soon, though, he 
did exhibit some rather strange behavior. Such

20:25.398 --> 20:25.939
as? Such as? going out on a pistol range and firing a 
pistol. I seem to remember that he wanted a license

20:34.405 --> 20:41.115
to carry a gun. He had a bodyguard under 
consideration. I saw somebody walk in that might

20:44.981 --> 20:49.408
have been that person. So there were things that he 
did that were unusual. He would keep people

20:53.134 --> 20:57.340
waiting for an hour. But there were other things he 
did that were just a hoot. I mean, he'd walk into my

21:01.800 --> 21:11.312
office reading something, and he'd sit there and 
read something to me for a half hour that he thought

21:01.800 --> 21:11.312
it was funny, and we'd chat. He didn't care what his 
schedule was. He couldn't care less about mine. Or

21:15.738 --> 21:16.679
he'd call me in. You know, Mobley never walked into 
my office in all the time, and he was just across the

21:17.239 --> 21:23.747
hall until he moved over to the tower. Mm-hmm. I 
don't know how many times Frank walked into my

21:25.754 --> 21:31.561
office or called me into his or I wandered into his. 
As you worked with Vandiver, did you develop any

21:33.323 --> 21:45.657
understanding of any unwritten rules or 
guidelines in succeeding with him?

21:52.404 --> 21:55.508
I learned fairly early on that

21:58.340 --> 22:03.144
He wasn't into management principles and that 
sort of thing. I remember once he jumped on poor

22:03.184 --> 22:14.294
Howard Vestal, who was coming up with a proposal to 
have us all learn more about control procedures or

22:03.184 --> 22:14.294
something. I don't remember what. I liked Howard 
very much, by the way, and I know Mac did. And

22:21.420 --> 22:27.165
Vannevar did too, but I guess. But that was one 
foible he had. I admired the man tremendously for

22:34.631 --> 22:49.087
pushing ahead on things like the Senate, when, 
boy, there were folks in agriculture

22:34.631 --> 22:49.087
particularly that were dead set against that kind 
of thing. All right, let me turn the question then.

22:54.994 --> 22:56.916
What were his greatest strengths? and his 
greatest weaknesses?

23:02.876 --> 23:08.682
Well his greatest strengths I think were that he 
knew what a real university is about.

23:11.886 --> 23:21.998
He was really on to getting us off the AAUP list and 
he worked hard to do that. He wanted us to have Phi

23:22.538 --> 23:27.544
Beta Kappa and he tried that. He encouraged the 
creation of the Senate, as I said, even though, as

23:27.777 --> 23:40.496
he said, there'll be days when I'll hate myself for 
doing this in the spite of opposition. He was

23:41.778 --> 23:51.232
masterful at going over and testifying before a 
committee in Austin. They'd ask him some question

23:52.093 --> 23:55.658
and we'd look at it and go, How is he going to answer 
that? How would he know what the answer is? He would

23:59.688 --> 24:08.856
come out with a flawless answer, and after we 
checked it out, you know, it was pretty close to the

23:59.688 --> 24:08.856
truth. He was a genius at that. He really handled 
people well. He was good at that. But he always kept

24:16.683 --> 24:21.447
his eye on what he should be doing. I liked him when I 
would go ask him for money for proposals. I

24:27.449 --> 24:37.938
remember I wanted to see an expansion of the 
academic study leaves. There were, what, five or

24:37.958 --> 24:48.768
six in those early days, so one year as low as four, 
and the formula over in Austin was never going to be

24:37.958 --> 24:48.768
implemented. So anyway, I put together a 
proposal, I guess about eighty-two, three, four,

24:50.530 --> 24:55.294
somewhere in requesting a significant sum of 
money from the former students and routed it with

24:57.097 --> 25:03.847
his. I had his permission to do it, of course. It 
went over, and the year that it was decided was the

25:08.193 --> 25:15.964
year that Ed Davis was the ex-president of the 
former students. What they decided to do was that

25:17.206 --> 25:25.197
they would come up with, I've forgotten how many 
thousands of dollars, if we would match the money.

25:27.016 --> 25:33.764
And Hed Davis a couple days later ran into me and he 
said, I thought maybe you'd want to shoot me. And I

25:33.784 --> 25:37.729
said, oh my God, Hed, you did the best thing I could 
ever imagine. Well, anyway, so he got enough to do

25:37.829 --> 25:43.936
15 or 18, depending upon the level of his salary. 
And I was really pleased with that. But that was

25:46.519 --> 25:49.082
something that he really went to bat for. He went to 
bat for minority hiring. Oh. there was a period of

25:56.378 --> 26:01.023
time when we put up all the money for a minority 
hire. And then when we started splitting it as a

26:02.065 --> 26:13.758
cost saving, when Mobley came in, we split the cost 
with the college and had to bring in very many. That

26:14.499 --> 26:25.272
was always a tough thing to do, to recruit 
intellectual blacks into a community where

26:14.499 --> 26:25.272
there's a relatively small intellectual 
community. Fred McClure was the first one who told

26:25.657 --> 26:33.034
me that as a student, that we didn't have enough 
black professionals here for the new black

26:33.554 --> 26:42.504
faculty member or staff member to find off-campus 
friends in a black community? I'm trying to think

26:43.385 --> 26:45.047
of her name. It was assistant to Frank Black, who 
said if she wanted to go to a black church where she

26:45.187 --> 26:58.903
felt comfortable, she'd have to go to Houston, 
where she's now vice president, I guess, still, at

26:45.187 --> 26:58.903
the University of Houston. Alright, Vandiver, we 
talked about his strengths, let's go to the other

26:58.883 --> 27:06.072
extreme. Weaknesses, well some of the wacky 
things that he did were.

27:13.482 --> 27:15.765
He forgot to go to Muster the first year I remember. 
Oh yeah, leading the band I guess at Rice.

27:23.538 --> 27:28.485
You know, he had a great sense of humor, and he 
thought people would think it was clever. Well,

27:28.565 --> 27:34.834
maybe he never really understood old Ags too well. 
Standing people up for meetings, and sometimes

27:35.776 --> 27:42.486
he'd show up, sometimes he wouldn't. Sometimes he 
said things that were preposterous, like, he

27:50.234 --> 28:03.136
tried to catch an airplane in the Houston and he 
just missed it and we figured how long it would take

27:50.234 --> 28:03.136
him to get there without even stopping and turning 
around and coming back and he couldn't have done

27:50.234 --> 28:03.136
it. I may take this out afterwards but overall the 
place moved under him. Now he and Hubert had been

28:15.209 --> 28:17.091
acquainted for a while. Hubert's son had been in 
Vandiver's classes at Rice and so forth. After

28:22.058 --> 28:30.730
Hubert retired, did Vandiver's relation with the 
system change that you knew of? No, I wouldn't know

28:30.750 --> 28:36.978
really. I thought that he and,

28:37.779 --> 28:43.967
oh, who succeeded Hubert? Art Hanson. I thought he 
got along well with Art Hanson. He's got some

28:51.711 --> 28:54.700
things settled like if if one person owned only 13% 
of a faculty member's salary, he couldn't dictate

28:56.384 --> 29:08.441
the salary increase as one person tried to do in 
agriculture. And you know who. Anyway, they got an

29:11.846 --> 29:13.508
agreement. Whoever had the biggest percentage. 
Now, Prescott continued as the Chief Academic

29:20.870 --> 29:23.413
Officer under Vandiver. For a year, I guess. Okay. 
Maybe two. Okay. And then he retired, and who took

29:29.041 --> 29:31.404
over? Then Gordon Eaton. Gordon Eaton, who had 
been Dean of Geosciences. And only a year or so.

29:40.636 --> 29:41.417
Okay. What triggered Gordon's being selected, I 
think? There were two searches. I chaired both of

29:47.325 --> 29:48.307
them. The first one failed. The second one,

29:50.975 --> 29:58.404
Gordon by then had been there a year and he was 
really impressive. And Vandiver had decided, oh

29:59.205 --> 30:16.165
by this time we'd also, the head of the former 
students association had dumped a whole bunch of

29:59.205 --> 30:16.165
money on us for teaching only awards so that they 
would be far greater than the research awards. And

30:17.166 --> 30:18.147
we plotted to get those transferred to $1,000 
awards and spread among all the colleges.

30:27.594 --> 30:30.076
I like to think it was my idea, but I don't know. I 
can't remember whether it was or not. But anyway,

30:32.599 --> 30:34.461
it turned out to be a good one. They agreed to it. And 
so these awards would go on at each college. And

30:43.752 --> 30:46.935
Vandiver went to the one at Geosciences And Gordon 
had already prepared his remarks, so he wasn't

30:47.337 --> 30:52.003
saying something because Frank was there. And 
Gordon was explaining what the administration

30:53.484 --> 31:01.694
was doing to the four and to the faculty, why things 
were happening. Frank was immensely impressed,

31:02.195 --> 31:16.011
because typically, I mean, you get a guy like, I 
won't mention any names, but some would openly

31:02.195 --> 31:16.011
deride the administration Not me, because I was 
always sitting there. I went to all these

31:18.951 --> 31:21.114
meetings. You know, they might, or they wouldn't 
say anything. More than likely, they wouldn't say

31:24.618 --> 31:26.099
anything. But he went out of his way to explain 
what's going on in the head shed, as he used to call

31:27.641 --> 31:34.809
it. And I thought that was impressive. So did 
Frank. And they got along well together. All

31:40.456 --> 31:42.218
right, so you worked with Eaton for? For four 
years, I guess, three or four years. They were the

31:45.869 --> 31:46.953
best years. All right, describe his style. He was 
laid-back, uh,
