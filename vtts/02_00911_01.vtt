WEBVTT

00:05.633 --> 00:10.458
It's Thursday, the 18th of June, 1981. And we are at 
the residence of Hugo Leipziger Peirce in Austin,

00:10.518 --> 00:17.365
Texas. Hugo,

00:17.385 --> 00:23.992
why did you arrive in Houston? I mean in Austin. And 
what brought you to Texas initially? What did you

00:30.780 --> 00:34.864
find yourself doing here? Well, Bob, this is sort 
of an interesting little story. I came from

00:39.578 --> 00:54.284
Australia in early 1939 to finish the Australian 
Pavilion at the New York World's Fair, which was

00:39.578 --> 00:54.284
part of the British Pavilion. And at that time, I 
came as a visitor here being employed by

00:59.566 --> 01:08.255
Australia, by the Australian government, and met 
some old friends in Washington. I was introduced

01:09.756 --> 01:11.598
to Katherine Bauer. Oh, really? She was on my 
thesis committee at Berkeley. Oh, she was. And I

01:18.005 --> 01:25.793
met Oskar Stonerow and Berla and my friend from 
study days, Alfred Kastner. So it didn't take very

01:27.224 --> 01:36.058
long, and I was asked if I would be interested in 
staying here, although I couldn't formally do it.

01:37.400 --> 01:49.279
But through various good offices, I got 
permission to work in the United States, despite

01:37.400 --> 01:49.279
my visiting status. And because I could produce a 
number innovative public housing schemes, which

01:55.473 --> 02:04.302
I had done in Germany some years back on that date. 
And so at that time, I also received, through

02:05.403 --> 02:17.536
Katherine Bauer, the recommendation to the 
Rockefeller Foundation for a grant. And I

02:19.157 --> 02:23.742
received a three-year fellowship

02:24.785 --> 02:27.168
that could be used in connection with any 
university. But it was already too late in the year

02:29.311 --> 02:54.083
because any university availing herself of this 
grant had to get into some commitment to continue a

02:29.311 --> 02:54.083
planning program because you've got to remember 
that at that time the Rockefeller and the Carnegie

02:29.311 --> 02:54.083
Foundations had given $240,000 equally 
distributed between Columbia University,

02:54.755 --> 03:02.809
Harvard, and MIT, $80,000 each, to start a 
planning program. And so it was very difficult, so

03:04.973 --> 03:16.152
I decided almost to go back to Australia because it 
was difficult to get this commitment at that late

03:04.973 --> 03:16.152
period. So... On my way to San Francisco, I stopped 
in Austin, in Texas, to be exactly in some smaller

03:20.185 --> 03:31.559
towns where I knew some people. And there I 
received a telephone call from my friend Alfred

03:31.579 --> 03:48.440
Kestner, who was a consultant in Washington, that 
Carl Feist from Columbia University, who had been

03:31.579 --> 03:48.440
hunting in Canada when I went to Columbia, had 
asked for me. So I went all the way back to New York.

03:52.919 --> 04:03.433
And it turned out to be, yes, they would consider 
this, but for this particular year, it was

03:52.919 --> 04:03.433
difficult to get the commitment for the period 
after the three years were over. At that time, I

04:03.453 --> 04:16.990
stopped by again in Washington, DC, and my friend 
Alfred Kessner and I came back from some lecture

04:03.453 --> 04:16.990
that evening, and the radio was on. Well, in the 
middle of the talk, one couldn't very easily

04:18.995 --> 04:22.539
determine who it was. But it turned out to be Maura 
Maverick, who was a congressman from Texas who had

04:22.559 --> 04:31.449
just been appointed mayor of San Antonio. And 
Alfred Kessner said, well, that's your man. So he

04:33.371 --> 04:34.632
was hunted up. And he said, well, sure, I would like 
to have somebody who is conversant in housing

04:35.833 --> 04:42.461
planning matters. But the Rockefeller people 
said, no, it has to go through a university. And he

04:46.905 --> 04:48.327
said, well, that's easy, too. because Homer 
Pirani, who was the head of the National Youth

04:48.965 --> 05:04.085
Group in Washington, National Youth 
Organization, I forget the name, had just been

04:48.965 --> 05:04.085
made president of the University of Texas. And so 
between them, it worked out that I was accepted.

05:09.572 --> 05:18.043
Homer Pirani, as president of the University of 
Texas, committed the university to this

05:09.572 --> 05:18.043
procedure, and that's how I came to Austin, Texas, 
and I'm here ever since. Did you have much contact

05:19.238 --> 05:24.204
with Catherine? Yes, yes, yes. I retained this 
contact because she at that time had taken the

05:26.888 --> 05:47.794
assignment which originally went to Louis 
Mumford to go to Russia and write on housing

05:26.888 --> 05:47.794
conditions and housing projects in Soviet 
Russia. He didn't want to go, he didn't go, and

05:48.348 --> 05:52.074
Kathrin Bauer got the job. She went to Europe, but 
in London she had a very, very bad taxi accident and

05:52.655 --> 06:03.932
was laid off. So she couldn't go on. In the 
meantime, the war situation had started. What

06:09.961 --> 06:10.883
year was that? That was all in 1939. 1939.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.149
Bad year here. The end of 39, yes. And so she, by the 
time I was in Texas, she dropped me a little line

06:19.832 --> 06:36.873
that she had received an appointment at Berkeley 
to be on the faculty of the Home Economics

06:19.832 --> 06:36.873
Department, I believe, on housing matters. So she 
came through Austin, Texas, went on to Berkeley,

06:38.715 --> 06:45.844
and as you know, married... Bill Worcester. 
Eventually. Eventually, who had been an

06:48.678 --> 06:58.287
architect on war housing in San Francisco. And the 
war was started. And he and she both went to MIT,

07:01.229 --> 07:09.757
where he enrolled as a graduate student. And I 
visited again in their converted old apartment.

07:19.315 --> 07:25.743
And as you know, the story is he wound up as the dean 
of University of California at Berkeley. Let me

07:26.464 --> 07:41.683
interject here a moment, because this is 
interesting, because when they both returned to

07:26.464 --> 07:41.683
Berkeley, they were successful in buying a house 
at Greenwood Commons. from an old Stockton

07:42.153 --> 07:43.916
family. And Bill Worcester was a native of 
Stockton, California. And no one could approach

07:47.301 --> 07:55.594
this old lady except Bill Worcester, who had 
apparently done work for the family,

07:47.301 --> 07:55.594
architectural work. And so he was able to buy 
Greenwood Commons. And there was an old house at

07:58.118 --> 08:10.557
the lower end of it that Bill and Catherine wanted 
to move into initially while they were redoing the

07:58.118 --> 08:10.557
big house at the upper end of the Commons. And as a 
student assistant, it was my responsibility to do

08:11.043 --> 08:19.152
the measured drawings for their house. And so I got 
to know both of them quite personally before they

08:20.113 --> 08:25.780
were ever actively teaching. Well, Catherine, 
this sort of way of record, of course, known, I

08:25.820 --> 08:31.726
suppose. Catherine's sister was in the 
University of Oklahoma in Norman as a librarian, I

08:32.227 --> 08:40.016
believe. Oh, yeah. And so this is all history now, 
of course. But I kept up with them. They came to

08:48.216 --> 08:49.118
Austin. She came to Austin several times. And

08:50.741 --> 08:56.831
so the rest is a long story in itself.

09:00.778 --> 09:03.763
But she was instrumental in getting my 
Rockefeller right. And then through Mari

09:04.148 --> 09:11.481
Maverick in San Antonio, you ended up here in 
Austin under the auspices of the University of

09:04.148 --> 09:11.481
Texas. Yes. And what was your first assignment? 
Was it as a researcher then? No, I was put on the

09:18.252 --> 09:20.416
faculty. It was a difficult thing to arrange. They 
approached several different groups like the

09:26.086 --> 09:30.553
Bureau of Municipal Research, for instance, and 
government, you know. But they were all so set.

09:32.235 --> 09:33.598
Budgets were very, very tight. Nobody wanted to 
commit anything beyond three years. So I wound up

09:37.363 --> 09:40.949
in the School of Architecture, which was my 
background anyway. I was an architect and a

09:40.969 --> 09:46.257
housing person, you know. Sure. So

09:46.397 --> 09:50.203
the...

09:53.440 --> 09:57.838
University, the School of Architecture, started 
a conference. It was called the First Texas

09:59.243 --> 10:01.311
Housing Conference. And so there's a... the 
proceedings of this thing, various people and

10:05.388 --> 10:11.156
speeches given, you know, in the usual form. But 
then, by way of evolution, I taught a course on

10:11.176 --> 10:20.730
housing and city planning. And the architects and 
the interested people in the city of Austin

10:21.852 --> 10:31.486
attended this course, which was at 8 o'clock in the 
morning, so people could take it before they went

10:21.852 --> 10:31.486
to the offices. And... I was very pleased, so the 
people who are now all practicing architects were

10:34.312 --> 10:38.577
there. But pretty soon the enrollment dropped 
completely, and a year later, in 1940, we were in

10:40.219 --> 10:50.050
fact in the College of Engineering. And the then 
dean, W. W. Woolrich, who was from the family who

10:51.712 --> 11:01.703
owns the National Radiator Company

10:51.712 --> 11:01.703
in New York, who was also an officer in the TVA to 
replace and build new towns for the people who had

11:02.442 --> 11:18.158
to be replaced because of the dam building and the 
inundation of certain areas. He was very much

11:19.340 --> 11:25.306
interested in what we were doing, what I was doing 
in particular, because I was number seven on the

11:19.340 --> 11:25.306
faculty. The School of Architects was a very small 
faculty with a very large enrollment. Was Mel

11:31.754 --> 11:36.083
Roach here at that time? He came here after the war. 
But

11:38.168 --> 11:47.788
I heard that the cause of engineering had started a 
course in Houston, the city of Houston, under the

11:48.224 --> 12:00.964
Office of Education in Washington programs 
called ESMDT, Engineering Science Management

11:48.224 --> 12:00.964
Defense Training. So I decided I would ask for 
this, but everybody said, well, what has that to do

12:02.586 --> 12:08.916
with the war effort to train people who would fit 
into a new production because the city of Houston

12:08.896 --> 12:33.823
at the time had about 240 workshops I believe and 
they had to be traveled 24 hours a day and then they

12:08.896 --> 12:33.823
had to build additions to existing workshops and 
build new ones and obviously housing and

12:08.896 --> 12:33.823
transportation all these things were quite 
important so I got a questionnaire for the Office

12:34.816 --> 12:42.228
of Education in Washington to fill out. And they 
asked the question, minimum number of

12:42.328 --> 12:45.193
enrollment. And I said, well, if we get about under 
15 people, it wouldn't make any difference. And

12:50.562 --> 12:56.892
maximum number of enrollment, I said, well, 
unless we get maybe 35 people just way up, you know,

12:50.562 --> 12:56.892
someplace. So it was approved, to everybody's 
surprise. And that was the first ESMBT program in

13:01.026 --> 13:06.952
housing and city planning in the United States of 
this kind. Well, I went down to Houston. It's

13:11.777 --> 13:12.478
really funny. Each one of these things has a whole 
history, because the city of Houston, and I have a

13:13.079 --> 13:25.191
letter here from Mr. Bloom, who was the director of 
the housing authority there, who gave sort of an

13:13.079 --> 13:25.191
account what we did. 41, 42, and out of it came a 
graduate credit course in Houston, as well as

13:25.778 --> 13:33.046
Dallas and Fort Worth. Now, ESMDT at that time 
became, the war started the year afterwards,

13:35.028 --> 13:47.401
became ESMWT, Engineering Science Management 
War Training. And we kept going both in Houston,

13:47.421 --> 13:51.806
Dallas, and Fort Worth. Well, at that time, the 
question of people enrolling in this. And as I

14:03.083 --> 14:07.431
said, we were supposedly getting about 15 people. 
The first organization meeting at the Chamber of

14:07.892 --> 14:13.303
Commerce in Houston showed up 168 people. I didn't 
know what to do. You split that up into several

14:16.749 --> 14:18.853
sections. And so here we went. There were all the 
city council, the planning commission, the

14:21.519 --> 14:31.115
architects, the engineers, the landscape 
architects, the planning people who were there,

14:21.519 --> 14:31.115
and a lot of others. And among these other people 
was a young lady who came and said, I don't know

14:31.435 --> 14:39.067
anything about all this, and I would like to know 
more about it. My husband has been transferred

14:39.588 --> 14:42.793
from Washington, DC. He's an attorney. I'm a 
newspaper woman. So she did, and she wound up as the

14:45.682 --> 14:52.289
public relations person in the Houston Housing 
Authority. But I mention this because it was not

14:54.151 --> 15:09.747
until 1952, I believe, when the director position 
of the Housing Authority of San Antonio became

14:54.151 --> 15:09.747
vacant. And she became the director of the Housing 
Authority in San Antonio. Now, at that time, the

15:15.500 --> 15:25.733
Housing Authority had about 6,000 or maybe 8,000 
units to build, an enormous project, and a number

15:15.500 --> 15:25.733
of architects took part in all this. And she did a 
very, very good job. To make the long story short,

15:29.358 --> 15:37.989
she wound up as commissioner of housing in 
Washington, D.C. And Marie McGuire. So you know,

15:39.291 --> 15:41.794
this is sort of an interesting individual. people 
came out. But coming back to these training

15:43.204 --> 16:03.873
courses, of course we got all the money we needed to 
make, you know, bought equipment, bought

15:43.204 --> 16:03.873
literature, bought, made slides, thousands of 
slides, and that was really the beginning of our

15:43.204 --> 16:03.873
whole planning effort at the University of Texas. 
And then the graduate school on request from both

16:04.854 --> 16:11.443
the Dallas as well as the Houston people 
established a extension graduate center in

16:11.693 --> 16:19.141
Houston and Dallas, and people who qualified for 
it could get graduate credit for it. So then the war

16:19.161 --> 16:35.878
continued, of course, and I, after I finally 
immigrated in 1943,

16:19.161 --> 16:35.878
because I was here a visitor who had to immigrate 
officially, I joined the Navy B-12 training

16:37.124 --> 16:43.472
program at the University of Texas, and that was an 
interesting experience of a kind of quite

16:37.124 --> 16:43.472
different nature. But that got me in touch with 
California. The first time I went in this

16:48.838 --> 17:01.714
connection to California on one of these troop 
trains, you know, breaking down in the desert and

16:48.838 --> 17:01.714
getting the fresh breeze as you came to Manning, 
Banning. People opening the windows and

17:02.015 --> 17:03.840
everything, you know. And that's when I saw 
California for the first time from Bakersfield at

17:04.321 --> 17:12.262
8 in the morning on a Sunday in February. The train 
got into Oakland. into the Bay Area that midnight,

17:17.101 --> 17:33.870
and all day long, it was a brilliant day in 
sunshine, the nature was out, everything was

17:17.101 --> 17:33.870
green, the Sierra was sitting there, snow-clad, 
and no more such a view, you see, because now it's

17:17.101 --> 17:33.870
all smog, San Joaquin Valley, you can't see it 
anymore. That's right up the middle of the San

17:33.890 --> 17:37.516
Joaquin Valley, then, on that train. On that 
train, yes. Oh, it was marvelous, because there

17:40.241 --> 17:42.585
was no smog. Well, anyway, so that became really 
the beginning of the whole planning program. The

17:50.028 --> 18:01.024
war was over, and now then a rash of projects came 
in, all in connection with helping communities.

18:02.105 --> 18:06.752
And I have a whole bevy of catalogs and letters and 
stuff here. The first project was a rather

18:07.513 --> 18:09.536
interesting one. It was called the Burnett Plan. 
Bernard, Texas is a little community outside of

18:12.468 --> 18:18.454
that, about 60 miles out of Austin. And a young 
mayor, a doctor, asked us to come and see what we

18:18.474 --> 18:24.079
could do. So we started with our veterans coming 
back to school shortly after the war. And we

18:31.105 --> 18:34.909
started groups that worked with groups in that 
little community of 8,000 people. And that was our

18:35.950 --> 18:37.031
first. It was sponsored by the American Legion in 
Washington. because the American Legion was

18:42.370 --> 19:09.913
looking for some popular projects, and they had 
done, of course, the veterans bonus, as you

18:42.370 --> 19:09.913
remember, that was a big thing, and then came the 
community planning, because they had on their

18:42.370 --> 19:09.913
board a member of the Economic Commission of the 
American Legion, and it happened to be from

18:42.370 --> 19:09.913
Austin, Minnesota, the meatpacking plant, What 
is the name? I forget. Not Morrell. Marmer? No. But

19:17.902 --> 19:20.025
anyway, so one of the big meatpackers, you know. He 
had done something very similar in Austin,

19:20.105 --> 19:24.331
Minnesota. And so the American Legion went around 
and asked for a community to volunteer, and

19:24.351 --> 19:29.818
Bernard did it. And so the governor, and it was an 
enormous thing all over the state of Texas. But

19:35.686 --> 19:40.052
unfortunately, then the... The Korean War 
started in 1950, and this whole project was no

19:40.471 --> 19:50.962
longer needed, and the project as such 
disappeared in a sense. But it was quite a thing

19:51.382 --> 20:04.376
because the then

19:51.382 --> 20:04.376
commander of the American Legion came to us. It was 
a big thing. All these things, these projects

20:06.307 --> 20:07.929
helped us. And from then on, one community after 
another came and wanted some help. Now, this was

20:12.075 --> 20:13.097
about 1947? No, no, that is now 50, after the war was 
over. I see. 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52.

20:22.671 --> 20:24.353
As a whole, I have all listed here. You can take a 
look at it. If we go back to the year 1943, or 44, I

20:25.855 --> 20:34.508
guess it would be, the end of June of 44, Ellen 
Taniguchi was studying architecture at

20:35.382 --> 20:39.806
Berkeley. And he was in Professor Howard Moise's 
design class. And a good friend of mine, a high

20:45.712 --> 20:55.842
school buddy of mine, had invited me to the party at 
Howard Moise's house up on Panoramic Drive in

20:45.712 --> 20:55.842
Berkeley. And that's when I first met Ellen 
Taniguchi in 1944. Now,

20:59.025 --> 21:05.271
Ellen went on to become the Dean of the College of 
Architecture at the University of Texas here. How

21:11.615 --> 21:12.356
did that happen? I don't know. Would you please 
tell us how that happened? You see, it's really

21:16.322 --> 21:20.048
fantastic how all these little stones fit 
together. I mentioned to you a little earlier,

21:20.509 --> 21:30.685
Warren Callister and my wife Martha's sister had 
just returned with one of her women colleagues

21:20.509 --> 21:30.685
from a five-year... sent with the Navy in Japan as 
translator. And Martha talked her into building a

21:33.681 --> 21:40.852
house in Berkeley rather than buying an old house. 
And Warren Callister designed it just on the

21:41.913 --> 21:49.945
border of Oakland and Berkeley in a little valley. 
And Warren designed this very Japanese principal

21:55.218 --> 21:57.061
house. That is where I met Alan Taniguchi, who drew 
the earthquake structure requirements.

22:07.715 --> 22:22.896
So, when he and his parents went to the lower Rio 
Grande Valley shortly afterwards, in 54, maybe

22:07.715 --> 22:22.896
55, something like this. He

22:24.800 --> 22:37.233
settled down in the valley and one day he came to me 
because I had the urban renewal project in

22:24.800 --> 22:37.233
Mercedes in the lower valley. I had a little office 
down there and he said, well, if you could be of any

22:38.294 --> 22:42.919
help. And a few years or so later we met again in 
Dallas at an AIA convention and he said, well,

22:52.407 --> 23:04.731
O'Neill Ford suggested to talk to me about 
teaching, because he didn't want to give up his

22:52.407 --> 23:04.731
practice, but he wanted to come up maybe once or 
twice a week or something like this to teach, and I

22:52.407 --> 23:04.731
got him in here, you see. Now, from then on, he 
worked his own way, you know, and from assistant

23:04.751 --> 23:10.602
professor he became a full professor and dean. And 
then he resigned. Then he resigned and went to Rice

23:15.290 --> 23:23.980
University with our chancellor, or president at 
the time, who became president of Rice

23:15.290 --> 23:23.980
University. And that's where he worked with Crane 
and that group. But he moved back to Austin,

23:29.026 --> 23:31.830
although he's still teaching at Rice. That 
collaboration didn't work out too well, I

23:33.151 --> 23:36.215
understand. I don't know. I don't know those 
details, but he doesn't talk about it, so I don't

23:36.916 --> 23:40.060
know. But anyway, it's a different group of people 
there, and... And he has practice here now in

23:43.370 --> 23:48.256
Austin. So it's interesting how it all mashes 
together neatly. Well, I understand that when

23:56.226 --> 24:05.598
Alan left UT, he indicated in the newspaper why he 
was leaving. Well, yes. So that's a public thing.

24:10.217 --> 24:11.057
It's a public thing. It was a disagreement with the 
then chairman of the Board of Regents, Mr. Irwin.

24:17.203 --> 24:17.403
Irwin. Irwin, yes. And he took the side of the 
environmentalists about not cutting down trees.

24:24.350 --> 24:27.833
And they had some public argument about all this. 
But these things get sort of lost in history.

24:31.757 --> 24:34.740
Anyway, he made a good change. became a member of 
the Houston Planning Commission. But he felt

24:40.434 --> 24:42.978
maybe he wanted to come here. He is still working 
all over the state. He's in the lower valley. He's

24:46.202 --> 24:49.968
all over the place.

24:53.092 --> 25:02.466
Hugo, let's talk a little bit about the initiation 
of the planning program at University of Texas at

24:53.092 --> 25:02.466
Austin, when that occurred. and the relationship 
to the then American Institute of Planners and

25:02.952 --> 25:11.102
your philosophy of planning education.

25:14.326 --> 25:19.712
In ten words or

25:14.326 --> 25:19.712
less. Well, my background as an architect and 
housing office, I became active in the German

25:33.175 --> 25:48.938
semi-official housing agency, DEWOG, 
D-E-W-O-G, in Berlin, and became a regional

25:33.175 --> 25:48.938
director for the province of Silesia, Upper and 
Lower Silesia. And this gave me, between 1927 and

25:50.660 --> 26:03.098
1932,

25:50.660 --> 26:03.098
quite an opportunity to get into the total picture 
of city planning. In fact, I took quite a few

26:06.538 --> 26:27.803
courses and participated in any number of 
competitions, among them the, you mentioned

26:06.538 --> 26:27.803
Stockholm, I participated in 1932 in this 
revitalization of the downtown area, this one

26:06.538 --> 26:27.803
square mile downtown area of Stockholm. And the 
same for Antwerp. Quite a number of these

26:30.551 --> 26:32.213
projects. My interest in planning tied to the role 
of housing, where I earned my first experience

26:32.674 --> 26:45.310
with Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner in Berlin. And so 
my visits here in 1939

26:46.452 --> 26:58.768
brought me in contact with Mr. Strauss, who was at 
the time the director of the column of the United

26:59.356 --> 27:10.588
States Housing Agency, I believe it was. And in 
fact, he wanted me to take my planning projects to

27:10.608 --> 27:17.255
San Francisco. And at that time... Would that be 
the Housing and Home Finance Agency? That was

27:22.860 --> 27:24.863
prior to the Housing and Home Finance Agency. 
Prior to that. United States Housing Agency I

27:25.546 --> 27:55.266
think is the name and that became the HNHFA and you 
know various NHA and so that caused me to

27:25.546 --> 27:55.266
concentrate on this but of course my background is 
in design and as coordinator of so many functions

27:25.546 --> 27:55.266
in large scale housing I had a natural affinity to 
the the demands and the requirements and the

27:55.718 --> 28:03.467
academic training and research activities. So 
when I came here, starting with housing, with the

28:04.809 --> 28:25.152
demands of smaller communities into some help, it 
grew naturally, you might say, into what in 1958

28:04.809 --> 28:25.152
became the 701 Urban Planning Assistance 
Program. And as such, having done the master plan

28:31.120 --> 28:44.963
for Irving, Texas as a private consultant, I 
became supervising

28:31.120 --> 28:44.963
consultant to the health department. that had to 
review all the planning done by planning

28:45.922 --> 28:58.976
consultants for individual cities, a total of 
about 110 cities, which ultimately, after I was

28:45.922 --> 28:58.976
out already, grew to something like 260 
communities all over Texas. See, that figure

28:58.997 --> 29:01.900
isn't quite exact, but about this figure. The 
state health department was designated the

29:01.920 --> 29:06.445
planning agency for the state of Texas. Yes, 
that's right. Under the Housing Act, Federal

29:07.586 --> 29:10.269
Housing Act. That's exactly right, yes. And, of 
course, that gave an enormous amount of

29:11.926 --> 29:19.475
experience, and our students benefited 
tremendously from it. Now, we had everything

29:20.376 --> 29:25.762
worked out in 1951. When I

29:27.544 --> 29:40.279
came to...

29:41.238 --> 30:04.026
Back to Austin, after my work with the United 
States State Department as a special consultant

29:41.238 --> 30:04.026
to the United States High Commissioner for 
Germany in 1951,

29:41.238 --> 30:04.026
the graduate planning program had been already 
approved by the then Dean Brogan of the graduate

29:41.238 --> 30:04.026
school. I have all these letters. And we were... 
Dean Brogan? Brogan, yes. And he's now retired.

30:13.196 --> 30:17.141
And he authorized enrollment. And we started with 
an enrollment. I have all these figures here in

30:19.363 --> 30:22.988
detail, the people we started out with. When the 
state legislature put a freeze on all new graduate

30:23.829 --> 30:31.499
programs of any description. They're still doing 
it. Well, again, I guess. And that was in 1951. And

30:40.148 --> 31:09.700
the only way to salvage the graduate portion of our 
planning effort at the school was to go with

30:40.148 --> 31:09.700
existing master programs, like a master of 
architecture in community and regional

30:40.148 --> 31:09.700
planning, a master of arts in sociology, 
economics, business administration, whatever

30:40.148 --> 31:09.700
their qualifications were, with a major in 
community and regional planning. Now, of course,

31:10.372 --> 31:12.195
that was a tremendous handicap. We had a few people 
who went through all this, but most people took the

31:12.215 --> 31:23.433
courses and went on in their own area, 
specializing in planning, let's say, in

31:12.215 --> 31:23.433
sociology, economics, and so forth. Now, that 
went on until the year 1959.
