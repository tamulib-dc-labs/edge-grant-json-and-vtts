00:02.090 --> 00:05.715
This is an interview with Louis Antoine Truart. 
The date is the 20th of April, 1985. How old were you

00:10.282 --> 00:13.407
during the years 1940 to 1945? Fourteen.

00:17.653 --> 00:19.336
Where were you in the years 1940-1945? In Nice, 
France. How long after France fell to the Nazis in

00:22.661 --> 00:30.072
1940 was it before you became involved in the 
resistance? Well, quite a few years, because we

00:31.722 --> 00:45.959
moved from Lyon, where we used to live, down to 
Lourdes, which is on the border of Spain and

00:31.722 --> 00:45.959
France. And then at that time, I was just nine years 
old, and they flipped the coin between my mother

00:47.080 --> 01:00.396
and her friend, if we should stay in France or go to 
Spain. and the coin came down and we stayed in

01:00.950 --> 01:02.892
France. So we stayed in France. We stayed in 
Lourdes for quite a while, because France was

01:05.435 --> 01:11.202
divided. The northern part was occupied by the 
Germans, southern part was still free. The

01:16.989 --> 01:19.512
Italians were supposed to take over, but they 
didn't. And then we moved from Lourdes to

01:20.673 --> 01:27.681
Marseille, and then from Marseille to Nice. So you 
ended up in Nice in what year? We ended up in this in

01:30.937 --> 01:32.780
1943. Is that when you became involved with the 
resistance? Right after 1944, yeah. What part of

01:41.974 --> 01:43.496
the resistance were you in? What did you do? 
Sabotage. Okay, great. Did your role change or did

01:48.343 --> 01:51.588
you stay in sabotage the whole time? I stayed in 
sabotage and stealing weapons. Do you know who the

01:57.036 --> 02:00.201
head of your area of resistance was? By code name 
Manley. Did you ever find out who it really was?

02:04.968 --> 02:05.929
After the war, yes. After the war. What was the code 
name and who was the person? Beer Man. Beer Man?

02:11.097 --> 02:11.198
Yeah. And who was, what was his real name? What was 
the question? What was his real name? Oh, I forget.

02:17.367 --> 02:18.870
That's 40 years ago. I don't remember. That's 
okay. He was a sales representative for the beer

02:19.951 --> 02:26.121
distributor in that area of Nice. And we sell beer 
to the German and got friendly with them and talk,

02:26.675 --> 02:32.563
you know, and get information from them, that's 
all. But his code name was the Beer Man. But you

02:35.608 --> 02:37.611
didn't know who he really was until after the war? 
No, until after the war, yeah. Okay, great. Did you

02:41.637 --> 02:47.585
ever talk to your family about what you did or what 
they did, or did you see things that they did? Well,

02:48.486 --> 02:52.412
very likely because The way things were going, you 
know, you didn't know who your friends were, even

02:53.303 --> 02:57.046
in your family. And a lot of time in some of the 
family, some of the parents or kids turn against

02:57.727 --> 03:04.113
each other. And so we talked very little bit, 
although we knew what we were doing. We knew what my

03:09.979 --> 03:16.244
mother was doing, trying to get those Jew to escape 
from France to Spain, back to England. But that's

03:17.385 --> 03:20.188
about the extent of it. Very, very little bit. The 
less you knew and the better off you were. Just do

03:24.779 --> 03:26.161
your job and that was all. So your mother 
participated in the resistance too? Very

03:30.568 --> 03:31.910
strongly, yes. And what did she do? Some 
transportation? Did she do any intelligence? She

03:36.017 --> 03:42.266
was mainly information, gathering information 
from the German...

03:44.490 --> 03:48.015
I don't know what you call them, the German that... 
supply ammunition to the front line. They have a

03:51.069 --> 03:54.753
special name, and I forget what it is now in German, 
but whatever. She was trying to make them talk, be

03:55.333 --> 04:03.623
very friendly with them so that we knew their move, 
so we could go ahead and get in the middle of it and

03:55.333 --> 04:03.623
stop them. Did you ever help her with these 
conversations, try to get it out of them? No, she

04:07.747 --> 04:13.834
just did her own, you know, and she... We invited a 
German officer. They were real nice. We had a

04:17.782 --> 04:19.284
lieutenant. He was a German-Russian. His name was 
Lupankov. P-A-N-K-O-V is his name. A Russian, but

04:30.119 --> 04:32.402
a white Russian. And he was very mean, but he was 
very talkative, you know. I mean, we invited him. I

04:39.552 --> 04:41.695
mean, my mother invited him. feed him and give him 
wine and beer, kind of trying to mix things up so he

04:42.198 --> 04:55.174
could turn information loose, you know, and then 
say, hey, why don't you come up next Friday, you

04:42.198 --> 04:55.174
know, and we'll have a barbecue party or something 
like that. And he said, well, no, I can't because

04:55.274 --> 04:59.359
I'd have to be out of town. And I said, oh, come on, 
you can get somebody else to do it. He said, no, we

05:02.142 --> 05:07.429
have to take a whole triangle of ammunition in such 
and such place. And that's all we needed. So we

05:09.687 --> 05:12.190
turned that to the underground and blew the train 
up. So we were pumping information. For me, we

05:14.934 --> 05:17.097
never realized that's where it came from. And your 
mother turned that information over? We turned

05:20.482 --> 05:26.890
that over to a man that was the head of the Red Cross 
in Nice. We didn't know his name, but we knew he was a

05:26.910 --> 05:29.373
Red Cross man. That's all. And he was a Frenchman? 
Oh, yeah. OK. What were some of the special codes

05:35.860 --> 05:40.247
that help you to identify other people in the 
resistance? Did you know codes that would just, a

05:40.627 --> 05:48.118
general code that would help you know somebody was 
in the resistance, or did you just have codes that

05:40.627 --> 05:48.118
you worked with in your own little group? No, we 
just, we were, in our particular area, we didn't

05:48.138 --> 05:59.235
know no more than six people through a code deal, 
and any one of the six knew six more. So we couldn't,

06:00.093 --> 06:11.965
if we get caught, you know, and beat on to it, you 
know, to talk, we wouldn't give no more but just six

06:00.093 --> 06:11.965
people's name, code name, which really don't mean 
nothing to the German because it was not their real

06:00.093 --> 06:11.965
name. Did you have a code name? Yeah. What was it? I 
had two. One was the American. They called me the

06:18.953 --> 06:19.814
American. The other one, Mac. They called you the 
American? But for a long time after the war, you

06:22.977 --> 06:27.822
know, all my friends called me Mac. It was not my 
name, Louis H., who I had nothing to do. They call me

06:31.387 --> 06:32.008
Mac. They see me in the street, say, hi, Mac, how are 
you doing? Okay. That was just one of those names

06:35.151 --> 06:37.414
that just hang on with me. Huh. But the other one, 
the American, that was the one in touch with the

06:39.357 --> 06:45.404
beer man. Oh, huh. That's the only way we come in the 
UK. Beer man, American, won't talk to you, and that

06:48.728 --> 06:50.851
was it. If I give any other name, he won't see me. If I 
say I'm Mac, forget about it. Did you have a special

06:57.080 --> 07:06.869
code that meant certain things, like one sentence 
would mean, I have to go do this, or we need to do

06:57.080 --> 07:06.869
this, or get out of here, the Gestapo's coming? Oh 
yes, definitely. Could you give me some examples?

07:12.094 --> 07:13.876
Not really. We had code that was given to us through 
the beer man, telling us when to get a certain

07:15.498 --> 07:24.066
place, you know, like... if they were going to drop 
something from the airplane for us to use for

07:24.417 --> 07:36.668
sabotage purpose, then they had a code name saying 
that Robespierre will shave himself six times.

07:37.769 --> 07:40.192
That meant that we were going to look for six 
parachutes. They were going to send some stuff for

07:40.852 --> 07:43.655
demolition purpose. Or the last one we had was the 
car are going down the cellar. That man, you guys

07:51.569 --> 07:55.673
better hide out because D-Day is coming up. 
They're really going to drop it on you. And that was

07:57.736 --> 08:00.579
some of the code name, some of the code word we had. 
Do you know where the beer man got his codes? From

08:04.403 --> 08:09.748
the head of that particular area, which I knew 
after the war, you know, who she was. It was a lady.

08:11.410 --> 08:11.991
What was her name? Emily Jeté Latouche. She was the 
aunt... of the chief of police of the city of Nice in

08:18.350 --> 08:26.088
France, which at that time was about 250,000 
people. But you didn't know her name at the time?

08:28.694 --> 08:29.055
Oh, no. Did you know her code name? No. I didn't know 
her at that time at all. So if you got any code

08:34.955 --> 08:37.938
changes, they came from the beer man. Right. That 
was the head of our group. How did you know that if

08:41.602 --> 08:46.988
that man was going to shave six times, how did you 
know what that meant? We listened to that

08:47.449 --> 08:49.471
through... Oh, okay. The beer man knew some of the 
code that was given to him 24 hours prior to down on

08:50.092 --> 08:57.380
the radio, shockwave radio. They had a shockwave 
radio somewhere. And all those codes, they were

08:58.881 --> 09:02.385
fresh code. And... If they had that twice on the 
radio, then the Germans were trying to do the same

09:05.043 --> 09:20.442
thing, trying to come back with the same type of 
code, trying to confuse us, but we knew that was not

09:05.043 --> 09:20.442
it, because it was always a new code, and they knew 
the code name. And it happened that the German

09:21.183 --> 09:29.234
government radio, you know, and gave some false 
signal trying to catch some of the people, but it

09:21.183 --> 09:29.234
didn't work. They never did. How did you know it was 
the Germans? Because you use a colonel one time,

09:33.494 --> 09:36.719
that's it. After the rest, dead. And they never 
caught on to that fact? Well, they didn't know

09:40.486 --> 09:42.910
what's going on, you know, right then. What 
specific jobs did you do? And you can tell me about a

09:46.956 --> 09:52.806
few of the most important things that you did or the 
most outstanding. Well, sabotage and then

09:53.607 --> 09:57.173
police. plastic charge on the bridge, you know, 
just get the stuff ready for the people who knew

09:58.452 --> 10:03.297
what they were doing. In other words, they give us a 
bunch of little bag that had sugar or sand in it. And

10:11.726 --> 10:20.957
we were to crawl over the fence where they had all 
those tanks and the German Jeep and the truck

10:11.726 --> 10:20.957
parked. And they had a bunch of German Shepherd 
turn loose in the place. Well, we got friendly with

10:24.540 --> 10:27.784
them by giving, throwing them some meat. and then 
we used to go to those vehicles and drop those back

10:28.405 --> 10:51.207
in the fuel tank taking the cap off put them back in 
the tank you know and then when they start to drive

10:28.405 --> 10:51.207
the vehicle it jammed the engine you know just get 
the diesel pump all messed up and they just break

10:28.405 --> 10:51.207
down and then the underground just jump on the top 
of them and took care of them so they were just And

10:51.625 --> 10:54.428
then the other part of it was a plastic bomb. You 
know, the sticky bomb you put under a bridge to blow

10:54.848 --> 10:58.091
a bridge up. What we did is just stuck the stuff 
under there and then let the other guy take care of

10:58.832 --> 11:06.180
the charge and blow up the bridge. So you just made 
sure that he had everything he needed to work with.

11:08.262 --> 11:14.748
Yeah, we just stick the thing under, you know, that 
big black thing, go over there and stick it under

11:08.262 --> 11:14.748
that part of the bridge. So we just go over there, 
you know, and the Germans wouldn't know who it was.

11:18.312 --> 11:20.114
You know, we'd just see kids playing. They didn't 
think that we were... doing harm, and we were just

11:21.713 --> 11:24.556
sticking that stuff. And they were dynamite 
charged. Of course, we were kids, we didn't know

11:30.242 --> 11:31.764
about it. If we knew, we'd probably put the thing 
over there. But that's what we were doing. You

11:36.429 --> 11:37.590
know, they were using us. We didn't know what we 
were doing. But you knew it was to win the war. Yeah,

11:43.196 --> 11:46.440
it was to get rid of the bad German. We had some good 
German, but it was to get rid of the bad ones. Okay, I

11:51.548 --> 12:02.157
talked about the beer man a few minutes ago, and 
what we were doing, we were sending beer to Germany

11:51.548 --> 12:02.157
because they like beer, you know, like I do. And we 
used to sell them beer, and then we'd collect an

12:02.177 --> 12:07.262
empty bottle. So we used to go in the room, and when 
they were not there, when they were gone, doing

12:07.882 --> 12:20.273
their business, you know, out of town, and then if I 
see any weapons, hand grenade, gun, or... We

12:20.843 --> 12:27.532
didn't try to steal machine gun or rifle, but 
mainly pistol and hand grenade. Then I used to

12:28.072 --> 12:34.080
collect those and give them to the beer man so we 
could use them against the Germans. So that was

12:34.100 --> 12:36.303
lots of time. I used to go downstairs, four flights 
from the hotel with about six or seven hand

12:36.383 --> 12:44.674
grenades in my belt and two or three pistols. and 
didn't know what I was doing with it, but I would

12:45.397 --> 12:52.748
take it to the bear man and give it to him, and in 
turn, he'd give it to the right people, you know, to

12:45.397 --> 12:52.748
use. So that's...

12:52.768 --> 13:01.562
Did you work by yourself, or were there other kids 
that worked with you, or was that too dangerous?

13:01.722 --> 13:06.430
No, the bear man didn't want nobody to, nobody else 
to be involved with. We were a single unit. If you

13:08.333 --> 13:11.117
get caught, you couldn't give nobody else names. 
to the Gestapo, that's all. Were you asked to pick

13:14.110 --> 13:17.815
up small arms when you collected beer bottles? Or 
did you kind of do that on your own at first? No, they

13:21.560 --> 13:28.209
didn't ask anything so that if I was caught in 
trial, they could say that they asked me to do that.

13:28.790 --> 13:32.215
They said, do whatever you think is the best to do 
for your country. So we went ahead and took

13:32.255 --> 13:39.184
everything we could find, except the big thing 
that you couldn't hang, hide, you know, like a

13:32.255 --> 13:39.184
rifle. You can put that in your pants, you know, 
so... anything that's small enough like hand

13:41.287 --> 14:06.822
grenade pistol so we use it dynamite lots of 
dynamite took quite a bit of dynamite did you get

13:41.287 --> 14:06.822
your beer bottle route so that you could steal 
things or did it just happen to come along that was

13:41.287 --> 14:06.822
settled by beer man so he just set me up he knew where 
i was supposed to go but he didn't tell me that you

13:41.287 --> 14:06.822
know he just said you go there and there and collect 
and that's it four or five different hotels So in

14:07.966 --> 14:14.553
other words, he really did kind of set you up for the 
job, but you decided whether or not you wanted to

14:07.966 --> 14:14.553
take the arms at that particular time. Well, he 
knew what he was doing, and I didn't know any

14:14.573 --> 14:18.197
better, so I just wanted to do the job. All right. 
Did you know that D-Day was coming? Yeah, we were

14:24.604 --> 14:26.486
aware of it. Did you know specifically when? Did 
they give you a date, or just in a few days, or...?

14:33.773 --> 14:35.475
They give us a... signal that it was going to 
happen, no date and no place of whereabouts. But we

14:41.950 --> 14:48.636
knew that when they come up with a word through the 
BBC that it was time for us to get ready for it. So you

14:49.157 --> 14:52.460
got all your information through the BBC? That's 
correct.

14:56.383 --> 15:01.828
Were there any special actions that you or the 
group of people you knew of did to prepare for

14:56.383 --> 15:01.828
D-Day? Yes, at that particular time They say, when 
you hear a certain message through the BBC, then

15:05.965 --> 15:15.820
you say, at that time, go ahead and collect all you 
can from the Germans. That's handgun, machine

15:16.320 --> 15:21.788
gun, whatever you can, even if it's a big weapon. 
And then sabotage everything they have, like

15:22.489 --> 15:33.846
putting those little bags, whatever they had in 
it, sand or sugar, into all their tank, truck, and

15:22.489 --> 15:33.846
motorcycle. and just go and dump everything, just 
get rid of it, to create a panic with the Germans

15:34.433 --> 15:41.720
among themselves. So we knew that when that 
happened, that was it. Do that and then get out of

15:45.563 --> 15:49.067
the way because they'll be mad, they're gonna 
shoot everybody inside. So we did. Do you remember

15:51.249 --> 15:54.191
what the message was that you got from the BBC? Do 
you remember how it sounded, the words? Yeah, it

15:57.755 --> 16:03.360
was which means that the car will go down to the 
cellar. It was time for us to get down there and

16:04.235 --> 16:06.658
hide. We were the cow. Go down there and hide. Okay. 
Did you particularly have any special

16:10.644 --> 16:13.067
assignment? You were just trying to pick up all the 
arms and stuff. Yeah, we did. The last thing I did is

16:17.653 --> 16:25.164
pick up a German Luger out of the officer's room. It 
was a 9mm Luger. And I gave it to the beer man

16:27.667 --> 16:29.289
himself. He came by, you know, and I gave it to him. 
And I know that with that Luger, he shot a guy out of a

16:32.720 --> 16:36.777
motorcycle. He just put him out of business. So 
that was the end of it. Were you aware of all the

16:42.271 --> 16:48.200
other jobs that the resistance was doing, the 
intelligence, the transportation? No, all that

16:48.881 --> 16:50.924
was kept secret. Nobody knew what the other hand 
was doing. But did you know kind of in general that

16:53.408 --> 16:56.653
it was happening? We knew that the whole machine 
was rolling, but for protection among each other

16:56.853 --> 17:04.465
in case we get caught by the Gestapo. They wouldn't 
tell you anything, what one figure was doing to the

17:04.782 --> 17:09.166
other finger, you know. We just, you knew your own 
job and that's it. And you had nobody else but six

17:12.709 --> 17:16.713
people that you knew right around you. And each one 
of the six knew six other and that's it. And they all

17:20.556 --> 17:21.737
had code names. So we didn't know no name to speak of 
it, except recognize a face. Were you aware of the

17:26.802 --> 17:30.846
ongoing arrests and execution of resistance 
members? And if so, how did you deal with your own

17:31.186 --> 17:33.388
danger? Well, I was too young to worry about that, 
you know. Yeah, we were aware of some of the Germans

17:38.779 --> 17:48.272
catching some of the people my age, stealing guns, 
and then put their hand on the board and cut their

17:38.779 --> 17:48.272
hand with an axe. Just chopped the hand right off of 
it. And that we had, I had several, not several, I

17:51.636 --> 18:00.287
had a few friends that either where they had their 
hand chopped off or they had their feet chopped

17:51.636 --> 18:00.287
off. and just flat cut their feet with an axe. 
Goodness. Just as a punishment. Do you know

18:06.764 --> 18:17.519
anybody that worked with the resistance that had 
or has psychological problems like recurring

18:06.764 --> 18:17.519
nightmares, nervous breakdown, that type of 
thing? I have one friend, just one that I know, I

18:17.559 --> 18:29.515
forgot his name now, but he was, when the Germans 
caught him, the Gestapo caught him, they gave him

18:17.559 --> 18:29.515
to a, a kind of a experiment lab where they were 
injecting kerosene in his blood and studied the

18:30.592 --> 18:38.862
reaction. And after the war, he was crippled to a 
point that he couldn't walk. And he could, but he

18:45.670 --> 18:49.735
was really dragging himself like he had polio. And 
he became very ferocious. And at the end of the war,

18:53.139 --> 18:57.544
he knew some of the people that had done that to him. 
And he got the hold of what they call a Bok gun, which

18:58.553 --> 19:02.677
is a machine gun. When you pull the trigger, it was 
somehow automatic. And he shot a bunch of people

19:06.801 --> 19:14.068
that

19:06.801 --> 19:14.068
crippled him. Some were French that turned him in. 
And I remember one scene that I remember. It was

19:23.858 --> 19:27.261
downhill from our place. where he called one of the 
French guys that turned him in, and he told him, he

19:27.511 --> 19:37.165
said, and he turned around and just pulled the 
trigger and killed him right there with that

19:27.511 --> 19:37.165
machine gun. And you saw it? And I saw that, you 
know, and the guy just got killed right there.

19:41.651 --> 19:46.098
Well, he deserved it, really, but that's some of 
the things that happened. How old was that guy that

19:46.698 --> 19:48.621
got caught? Well, he was in his 20s. Oh, boy.

19:57.059 --> 20:06.691
Were there any specific Nazi raids in your area, 
such as gathering the Jews up or flushing out the

19:57.059 --> 20:06.691
resistance, any major things that happened in 
your area? Yeah, we had, my sister had a party for

20:06.711 --> 20:21.229
front of her birthday party, and usually the 
Germans didn't like for you to get together, you

20:06.711 --> 20:21.229
know, more than three or four people in one group. 
The minimum you could get together was three. And,

20:25.088 --> 20:33.976
but at that time we were such a good people with the 
German, they thought we were, you know, sending

20:25.088 --> 20:33.976
them beer and so that they okayed the party. But we 
needed, they needed at that time a record player to

20:34.357 --> 20:40.483
play music. So they weren't even borrowing that 
from the German. And the German caught that, that

20:43.365 --> 20:53.695
friend of my sister, you know, and then, and those 
are the airplanes coming on top here. an American

20:54.434 --> 20:56.737
airplane bombing France. They caught him and 
asked him to strip down and expose himself. They

21:05.088 --> 21:09.494
decided, well, either he's a Jew or he looks like a 
Jew. So after quite a bit of talking, they decided,

21:09.514 --> 21:15.402
well, he belonged to the Truart, so he's a good guy. 
They turned him loose. But he was an American Jew.

21:19.447 --> 21:21.370
He escaped real close. Were you ever questioned by 
the Nazis or the Gestapo? Yeah. One time as a kid I

21:30.078 --> 21:38.515
was playing a soldier and it was an American 
soldier and my friend was a German soldier. And I

21:39.220 --> 21:40.522
turned around and shot him. And boy, the Gestapo 
gave me hell for that. They took me in their house

21:43.626 --> 21:50.535
and put me in the dark room, and they said they were 
going to beat me and all that, but they were just

21:43.626 --> 21:50.535
scaring me, you know. But I really felt strange, 
you know, at that time. I bet. I was just a kid, you

21:54.060 --> 21:59.207
know, playing, and I was a good old American 
soldier, you know, shot a German, you know.

21:59.687 --> 22:02.511
Somebody had to be the American, end up to be the 
one, you know. But that's about as close as I got to

22:03.115 --> 22:07.440
the Gestapo that I wanted to be close to it. Did you 
think they really were going to beat you? Well, I

22:09.422 --> 22:13.267
thought they were serious about their business, 
you know, but they were just trying to scare me as a

22:09.422 --> 22:13.267
kid. Yeah. Were you ever questioned by the French 
police? No. I was too young for that. How did you

22:21.917 --> 22:29.185
feel about the French police, who seemed a lot of 
the time to help the Nazis locate members of the

22:21.917 --> 22:29.185
resistance? They seemed a lot of times to be... 
More for the Germans than for the French. We had,

22:34.955 --> 23:00.375
just thinking about that now, I remember 
something that a friend of mine, well he was not a

22:34.955 --> 23:00.375
friend of mine, he was a school guy, he was about 
four years ahead of me, he was about 18, I was 14, and

22:34.955 --> 23:00.375
he was in one of those dime stores in France. And I 
walk into that store, and I knew there was an

23:01.132 --> 23:08.784
underground guy that was being suspected by the 
Gestapo. So I went over there to warn him and say,

23:09.605 --> 23:20.503
hey, look out, you got the, we call them the cousin 
German, you know, the German uncle, I mean cousin.

23:20.523 --> 23:22.286
They asked you, get your butt out of here. And that 
guy that I knew it, There was a French guy, and he had

23:26.140 --> 23:31.425
a gun on him, and he was working for the Gestapo. He 
was a traitor. And I went to him, you know, and I

23:33.247 --> 23:36.270
said, oh, how are you doing? He said, well, I'm on 
surveillance right now. I'm watching that guy

23:38.312 --> 23:39.493
over there. And that was the guy that I just told him 
to get out of there. So I told him, I said, well, come

23:42.916 --> 23:46.600
on, let's go have a soda pop, you know, and we had ice 
cream. And by that time, the other guy left. And at

23:50.123 --> 23:54.227
the end of the war, that guy got shot, that 
collaborator. We used to call him that... Not

23:56.633 --> 24:00.659
through me, but somebody else had told me they just 
wanted to shot him. No trial. Do you know other

24:02.222 --> 24:05.948
people that collaborated with the Germans? Oh 
yeah, our neighbor. What did they do? They gave it

24:09.273 --> 24:15.122
to one of the mothers and a sister. They had a 
friend, he was a Jew. They put him on the train, sent

24:18.708 --> 24:22.033
him to Lyon so he can go to Switzerland. And they 
called the Gestapo. At that time, you could get 500

24:25.349 --> 24:31.475
francs for every people that you turn in for 
reward. And they did so, you know, and they went

24:32.276 --> 24:39.383
ahead and turned him in. He got arrested in Leon. 
And those people, they were colored white there,

24:42.125 --> 24:47.250
but they died before the end of the war anyway, so we 
didn't have to shoot them. They died of? Old age.

24:50.653 --> 24:52.695
You know, they just, about two years later, they 
were... But they were on the list of the bad people.

24:56.842 --> 24:58.043
They were our next door neighbor. Oh, wonderful. 
Were any members of your family ever question your

24:59.926 --> 25:05.895
sister or your mother that you know of? No, not 
really. No, they trust us too much. We would play

25:09.159 --> 25:10.461
our game right. Just that one time that your sister 
went to borrow the record player? Right. And then

25:14.207 --> 25:19.915
the time I played the American soldier.

25:21.127 --> 25:26.374
About what percentage of the population in your 
area do you think were members of the resistance?

25:26.394 --> 25:29.658
Well, we were kept in a blind spot, you know. All we 
knew, like I say, is six people in our area. We

25:32.982 --> 25:34.744
called the six men, that was it. But I would say that 
probably 30 or 40 percent of the population was

25:35.445 --> 25:40.131
involved. And the rest of it, they were too old to be 
involved in it. The younger ones, they were on the

25:45.358 --> 25:48.602
underground in Germany. Do you remember the names 
of the six people that you worked with? Yeah. One

25:55.014 --> 26:00.821
was an Armenian, and his name was Andrei 
Pekmezian. That's his real name? That was his real

26:02.223 --> 26:03.365
name, yeah. What was his code name? Do you 
remember? Oh, no, I don't. No? And then the other

26:06.869 --> 26:12.396
one was... Oh, the other one was me. That's two. And 
then the other one... We used to call him Hotel

26:19.733 --> 26:31.368
Riviera because he was the, his daddy was in charge 
of a big 200 room hotel next door to us. And I don't

26:32.410 --> 26:35.494
really remember his name. That's way over 40 years 
ago, but it's hopefully hard, you know, just two or

26:35.514 --> 26:42.042
three guys and that's it. Do you know what happened 
to any of them? Yeah, the only one that I know about

26:45.164 --> 26:50.009
is Andre Pecmesian. He's on a gold resale business 
around the world. He sells gold. He buys and sells

26:58.097 --> 26:59.178
gold. He's Armenian. And he used to live in France, 
and that's what he's doing. The other one's still

27:04.083 --> 27:05.785
in a business hotel. He manage hotel, big hotel. 
The same hotel? Probably. That hotel that I'm

27:14.746 --> 27:29.069
talking about, that Andre Pykmyshyn, not Andre 
Pykmyshyn but the other guy managed, that used to

27:14.746 --> 27:29.069
be the dump for the, what we call dump is where they 
put all the ammunition for the Germans. They had

27:29.930 --> 27:34.678
bombs and rockets and dynamite and hand grenades 
and And the ammo, just plain old rifle ammo, it was

27:35.148 --> 27:41.887
stacked up a mile high. They dug a big hole in the 
ground and buried all that and then stuck it by the

27:42.569 --> 27:46.761
ground. And then at the end of the war, they 
realized they couldn't carry that with them, so

27:47.264 --> 27:52.009
they blew the whole thing up. And you talk about a 
big hole in that place. I bet. They just blew the

27:55.093 --> 28:00.479
whole thing and blew the roof out of our house and 
blew the roof of Henry Peck Maison's place out.

28:00.919 --> 28:04.903
That's where we hide at the end of the war, in his 
house. And that was quite an explosion. They blew

28:07.867 --> 28:10.069
it up, or the Americans blew it up? They did. No, the 
Germans did. They knew they couldn't carry it, so

28:11.010 --> 28:14.534
they went ahead and sabotaged themselves. This 
was the Diamond D-Day? That was the same day that

28:17.403 --> 28:23.171
the Americans were landing in the central page in 
southern France. Did anything else happen in your

28:23.551 --> 28:26.615
city for the D-Day? Yeah. The French people got 
overexcited. They didn't realize that the

28:30.761 --> 28:36.929
Americans were supposed to go towards Marseille, 
which is the opposite direction of Nice. So they

28:37.770 --> 28:40.153
went ahead and liberated themselves. Like we did, 
all that gun and rifle and hand grenade they stole

28:40.724 --> 28:49.132
from the Germans, got in the street and started to 
shoot the Germans, so the Germans took off. They

28:49.312 --> 28:56.118
were overrun by 200,000 against maybe 10,000 
Germans, so they took off. But what we didn't

28:56.138 --> 29:02.624
realize is that they had that big armored train 
that was on track. They had a big cannon, and they

29:02.644 --> 29:09.330
had ammunition and everything on the train, and 
they took that on the hill above the town. And we

29:10.053 --> 29:14.321
were afraid that they were going to start to shoot 
the town, all the pieces. So some of the

29:15.122 --> 29:26.563
underground got in touch with the American that 
landed in St. Lopez and told them, hey, we are free

29:15.122 --> 29:26.563
now, but the Germans are coming back to free us. So 
they sent a colonel of GI to Nice to help us. And they

29:33.442 --> 29:34.623
were showing off, you know. When the Americans 
showed up, then the Germans really took off. Even

29:37.766 --> 29:42.371
though there was just a handful of it, it was just, 
it demoralized them to see the Americans were

29:37.766 --> 29:42.371
there. And if the Americans had to fight, they 
couldn't have fought because they were moving too

29:43.452 --> 29:47.456
fast. The tank and truck and all that, when they're 
moving, the jeep, they were traveling 60 miles an

29:48.057 --> 29:52.081
hour. Then the rest of the convoy didn't have a 
chance to catch up with it, but it played a real

29:52.962 --> 29:58.808
good... deal on the German's mind, you know, 
saying, oh, well, you got the Americans, just keep

29:59.311 --> 30:05.617
it up, you know, forget about it. What were the 
German people like? What were the German soldiers

30:08.859 --> 30:10.301
like? Oh, we had some real, real good guys. We had 
two men that I really remember real well. They were

30:18.988 --> 30:27.816
real good guys, and one still is, well, I guess he's 
died of old age by now, but one was, his name was

30:18.988 --> 30:27.816
Ludwig Gioff. And the other one was Carl Berger. 
And Carl got killed by the French communists,

30:30.459 --> 30:34.886
which were not part of our group. They were another 
group that we didn't like, but they had done their

30:34.906 --> 30:39.673
own damage to France. But Ludwigs Guiaf, we had him 
in our hotel at the end of the war, where we already

30:40.414 --> 30:51.492
had some American pilots that were hiding. They 
were shot down, you know, so we told them, hey, just

30:51.775 --> 30:55.700
stay there, you know, this is the end of it. Pretty 
soon the G.I. will be over and you'll join your

30:57.142 --> 30:59.025
rank. So when that officer came down the basement 
and saw those Americans, and he put his gun down and

30:59.986 --> 31:07.976
said, what the heck's going on here? And we told 
him, we said, well, we had those... American pilot

31:12.363 --> 31:19.593
for quite a while here, and we just couldn't, 
things were getting tighter, we couldn't turn

31:12.363 --> 31:19.593
them back to Spain, you know, and back to England, 
so we kept them over here. So he just laughed, he

31:20.394 --> 31:23.137
said, well, I guess I'm your prisoner now. So, but 
he was a real, real nice guy, and right now, well, at

31:24.259 --> 31:39.619
the end of the war, back in 1952, I was in Germany, 
and he had a restaurant over there in Saarbrück,

31:24.259 --> 31:39.619
and I met him over there again, and I had quite a 
welcome. He got me so drunk, I don't even know what

31:41.143 --> 31:52.139
the hell happened that day, but he really was 
pleased, you know, that what we did to him as a

31:41.143 --> 31:52.139
German officer, to the American, you know, save 
him from being shot. And he was a real nice guy.

31:54.462 --> 32:01.692
During the whole first phase of the war, they give 
us food and provide us with things that we needed.

32:02.768 --> 32:05.311
The Germans themselves, they were not bad. The 
ones who were bad were the Prussians, what they

32:05.772 --> 32:10.718
called the Gestapo, the Wehrmacht, the SS. Those 
guys, they were terrible. They'd shoot their own

32:12.700 --> 32:14.382
mother, their own sister. They didn't care. But 
the Germans themselves, they were good people. I

32:18.307 --> 32:20.610
had no trouble with them at all. They helped us 
quite a bit. They helped me quite a bit. How? They

32:24.695 --> 32:25.195
fed me. That's for sure. They gave me food. They 
split the ration, and they said, don't eat too,

32:27.710 --> 32:36.722
because if I said that I give you some of my food, 
they'll cut my food out, and then that's it, you

32:27.710 --> 32:36.722
know? So I kept my mouth shut, just chewing on it. 
You just mentioned something about taking the

32:40.400 --> 32:46.546
American pilots to Spain. Do you know anything 
about the transportation routes of the Jews or the

32:46.866 --> 32:52.712
American pilots that got shot down? Yeah, my 
mother was in charge of that. At that time, I didn't

32:54.534 --> 32:57.017
know what she was doing after the war. I realized 
what she did. And what she did was she disguised

32:58.098 --> 33:09.529
those American pilot and copilot and gunner and 
whatever it was on the plane, give them women's

32:58.098 --> 33:09.529
clothes. And then when the man from the Red Cross 
came with his van, panel truck, they load all those

33:09.948 --> 33:18.696
women aboard the truck and take them to Spain. And 
then from Spain, they would get on a submarine and

33:18.937 --> 33:21.579
go to England. And two of the people that she sent 
through there, one was a major. I don't remember

33:32.130 --> 33:33.151
their name. One was a captain, one was a major. 
They're the one who gave our name to the American

33:40.762 --> 33:56.997
the government, and in turn, they called my mother 
in Paris and give her a medal, and then they called

33:40.762 --> 33:56.997
me and give me a medal, and of course, I didn't care 
much about a medal, you know, but we got the medal

33:40.762 --> 33:56.997
anyway, and they told us anytime I want to come in 
this country, but we had the door wide open. And did

33:57.758 --> 33:59.099
you, when you came here? Well, I couldn't speak a 
word of English, and I didn't care to come over

33:59.439 --> 34:08.187
here, but I came here on vacation, and I'm still 
here, and that's what my boss says, still on

33:59.439 --> 34:08.187
vacation. You haven't mentioned much about the 
plight of the Jews during this time, except for

34:09.466 --> 34:16.634
that one time for your neighbor. Did you know 
anything about the gathering up of Jews, the

34:17.095 --> 34:23.923
transportation of Jews to the concentration 
camps? Well, not a lot, no, other than the close

34:24.904 --> 34:32.593
friends that I had that were Jews. I knew that some 
of them got caught in a... They were put in a boxcar

34:37.175 --> 34:42.920
where they put cattle in it and packed them and sent 
them to Germany. But we didn't keep track. We

34:45.583 --> 34:46.704
couldn't keep track at that time. Of course, we had 
no communication. But we knew they had it. Once

34:50.207 --> 34:51.649
they got on those trains, that was it. Yeah. Was 
there any specific place in your area where the

34:53.090 --> 34:59.837
Nazis took the Jews before they boarded the trains 
to go off? Yeah, they had a house about a couple

34:59.857 --> 35:05.562
blocks down from our place. They called it Villa de 
Nobilis. And that was a center where they question

35:08.764 --> 35:19.778
and interrogate the suspect on the underground, 
all Jews, to get more Jews' names or more

35:08.764 --> 35:19.778
underground names. And they had the SS and the 
Gestapo right there to do the interrogation. And

35:28.510 --> 35:34.958
that house was known to be a torture house where 
they put you in the basement. They had a post in the

35:35.798 --> 35:59.744
center of the room, and they'd strip all your 
clothes and make you walk around and around that

35:35.798 --> 35:59.744
post during the winter when it was real, real cold, 
and then trying to make you talk, and if you

35:35.798 --> 35:59.744
collapsed or fell down, they'd get a bucket of 
water and they'd just throw it at you and wake you

35:35.798 --> 35:59.744
up, you know, and knock you with a battle rifle, and 
you'd go again around the post until you'd talk or

35:35.798 --> 35:59.744
you'd die. And they had on that house, after the 
war, I remember now, a place, they had a bathroom

36:05.667 --> 36:16.684
where they used to submerge people, submerge 
their head in the bathtub full of water and then

36:05.667 --> 36:16.684
wait that you suffocated. And then when you start 
to turn blue, I guess, you know, they pull out the

36:17.665 --> 36:25.437
water, give you artificial respiration, try to 
bring you up and then make you talk again. And then

36:26.098 --> 36:27.540
telling you that you were dying. And that was some 
of the good things that they were doing to you. And

36:32.387 --> 36:33.649
the other The only other thing that I remember is 
what they call the lead room. It was a room that was

36:38.104 --> 36:55.857
fully, the walls were covered with lead, and they 
keep you in that room, and as you know, I don't know

36:38.104 --> 36:55.857
what it does to people, but they say it reacts to 
their physical, you know, they just... Turned

36:56.242 --> 36:58.765
insane, you know, because there was no way out. 
There was no air coming in, no nothing. It was

37:00.927 --> 37:02.049
sealed completely. That was the only type of 
insulation they had, solid lead. So they just keep

37:05.993 --> 37:16.446
them in the room and keep those either Jew or 
underground guy, seal them in that room, you know,

37:05.993 --> 37:16.446
and then just wait, you know, peek through 
windows. They had double window deal and see when

37:16.506 --> 37:24.595
the guy collapsed, you know, go in there and bring 
him back to life, make him talk and then turn him

37:16.506 --> 37:24.595
back into the room. So those were the few places 
that they tortured people in that Villa de

37:25.486 --> 37:30.813
Nobilis. What does that name mean? It's just a name 
like Joe Brown or Frank Smith. It was a name, an

37:37.581 --> 37:40.785
Italian architect that designed the house. Way 
before the war, he had nothing to do with what

37:41.726 --> 37:44.910
happened to it. Did you know anybody personally 
who were tortured in some of these rooms, or did you

37:45.211 --> 37:52.840
just hear stories or somebody that knew somebody? 
No, we had a... The head of the underground in our

37:55.709 --> 38:04.698
particular area, her name was, I guess I said that 
before, Emilie Jete Latouche. She was the aunt of

38:05.739 --> 38:09.263
that chief of police in Lyon. I mean, chief of 
police in Nice. And she was in that house. Did I

38:18.352 --> 38:19.894
mention that on the tape before? Well, she was 
tortured, you know, and then the Gestapo came over

38:20.633 --> 38:23.499
and picked her up. Okay, well, that's one of the 
people that I knew that went through that

38:24.361 --> 38:29.732
particular place right there. And then there was 
another French Jew woman who went through there,

38:30.534 --> 38:38.490
but somehow she got free through some... German 
mistake. They turned her loose, you know, thought

38:40.545 --> 38:42.528
they had the wrong woman. And they had the right 
one. There's a bookkeeper mistake right there.

38:46.735 --> 38:47.877
And Bo, she disappeared too. I mean, they couldn't 
find her after that. She got out of there and she

38:50.822 --> 38:52.645
just escaped. And that's about it. Okay, on that 
Villa de Nobilis I was talking about a few minutes

38:55.810 --> 38:59.837
ago. That lady that we learned later on was the head 
of our underground, was of course Emilie Jete

39:00.003 --> 39:10.499
Latouche, and she was caught by the Gestapo. They 
took her into that villa and then just go in and

39:10.979 --> 39:20.974
torture her, beat her up to death, you know, and 
just left her almost dead, you know. And finally

39:21.776 --> 39:23.378
the German Wehrmacht and the Gestapo came over to 
pick her up, take her to a correctional center

39:23.881 --> 39:39.196
where they would really start to cut on her finger 
and cut on her toe and then just cut the piece, you

39:23.881 --> 39:39.196
know, to make her talk. They came over to pick her 
up. So the German people in that villa turned loose

39:41.859 --> 39:49.787
to that Gestapo and the Wehrmacht And the officer 
in charge of that particular group, there were

39:50.223 --> 40:05.325
five guys, just went ahead and knocked the heck out 
of her, you know, just put her on the ground and say,

39:50.223 --> 40:05.325
you think you had hell over here, you just wait 
until we give you our treatment. We're going to

40:05.825 --> 40:11.553
start to cut your finger one at a time, you throw one 
at a time, you burst one at a time, you're going to

40:05.825 --> 40:11.553
talk. And they loaded her in the car and then took 
off. And that was the end of it because all those

40:14.177 --> 40:18.323
guys that were from the underground, they just 
free her up. And the Germans were really upset

40:19.298 --> 40:27.029
about that, but the Germans that were supposed to 
come over and pick her up, they were all killed and

40:19.298 --> 40:27.029
bushed by those people. So she was freed, and after 
the war, and of course she came through that, you

40:27.990 --> 40:42.150
know, and her nephew was the appointed chief of 
police for the city of Nice, and I knew him pretty

40:27.990 --> 40:42.150
well myself. young friend of mine in school that 
was his nephew. So it was kind of like a family deal.

40:49.987 --> 40:59.080
Are there any other people that you know worked in 
the resistance and are now important people or

40:49.987 --> 40:59.080
still in the area there? Okay, when we were in San 
Diego, we met, excuse me, We had a, we met a friend in

41:07.966 --> 41:13.413
San Diego in California that was from France. And 
he was in the underground in the Pyrenees. His name

41:19.280 --> 41:20.942
was Maurice Richoux. And the Gestapo caught him. 
And to make him talk, they hang him by the foot. And

41:28.371 --> 41:37.602
then when the blood come to his head, you know, when 
it got real red, purple, you know, they just went

41:28.371 --> 41:37.602
ahead and beat him up in the head, you know, trying 
to make him talk. And he's, well, at that time he was

41:38.290 --> 41:42.378
in San Diego. He was a tailor making a suit, a real 
good French tailor. Did he have any problems from

41:49.713 --> 41:54.823
the beatings and stuff that he received that you 
could see? Well, really he didn't have no

41:56.185 --> 41:58.510
problems. the physical problem that you could see 
except that he was kind of a slow to react on

41:58.777 --> 42:06.867
question that you ask him. His wife used to get mad 
at him, you know, and you ask him a question and it

42:06.947 --> 42:16.059
take him a while, you know, to go ahead and register 
and then give you an answer. But that was due to the

42:16.700 --> 42:26.012
beating that he got, you know, and it just affect 
his brain, you know, just being hang upside down

42:16.700 --> 42:26.012
and went through all the blood get to your head and 
you get beat onto it. I'm pretty sure done some

42:26.693 --> 42:28.615
damage to his way of thinking after that. Did you 
have any personal memories or problems that came

42:32.990 --> 42:42.525
about as a result of the war and your activities in 
the resistance? Well, after the war, when

42:43.547 --> 42:57.488
everything was over with it, the American Free 
France, for many, many years after that, at night

42:43.547 --> 42:57.488
if I could, if I hear airplane flying, it used to 
scare me. because I used to remember that all the

42:57.991 --> 43:09.265
flight that the British and American Air Force 
were doing over France was at night so they don't

42:57.991 --> 43:09.265
get shot. So anytime I heard, anytime I could hear 
an airplane flying at night, it just scared me to

43:10.106 --> 43:16.774
death, you know. And for a long, long time after I 
came in this country, night flight was just a

43:16.975 --> 43:23.523
nightmare for me. I just stayed in the bed and 
listened to it and was waiting for the bomb. And

43:28.130 --> 43:28.851
that's about it. OK, something else I remember. I 
remember when we were fleeing from the German.

43:36.397 --> 43:38.459
They came through France. We left Chaussin, which 
is in Jura. We went through Lyon and southern

43:43.124 --> 43:44.985
France. And we end up in the Pyrenees. We had on the 
road, we were driving. And you could see cars on

43:52.612 --> 43:54.754
each side of the road. They were shot down by 
airplane, by German airplane. And in our car, my

43:58.606 --> 44:07.141
mother was there, my sister, and Mr. Jean there, 
the friend of my mother and her daughter and

43:58.606 --> 44:07.141
myself. And my mother had a little briefcase 
handcuffed to her hand where they were carrying

44:08.343 --> 44:14.715
all their gold. It was full of gold. We were taking 
that to Southern France. And in the trunk, we had

44:21.995 --> 44:28.244
everything we could salvage from the place, you 
know, that Mr. Jean did salvage, which was, it was

44:21.995 --> 44:28.244
champagne. So we had champagne in the trunk, we had 
gasoline can in the car, and we had gold in the front

44:29.085 --> 44:33.512
seat. And every time we could hear one of those 
planes coming above us, you know, he pulled under a

44:34.553 --> 44:51.057
big, tall tree, a poplar tree, you know, which are 
pretty tall, and you could hear the machine gun or

44:34.553 --> 44:51.057
the airplane trying to shoot us, you know, and we 
just wait there until he got tired of flying or run

44:34.553 --> 44:51.057
out of fuel, you know, and take off, and then we keep 
on going. One thing that I remember, we used to, not

44:52.927 --> 45:05.465
we, but my mother and Mr. Jean, they used to trade 
some of the champagne for food and other need that

44:52.927 --> 45:05.465
we needed, like milk for us. And we stopped into a 
small town and it was a dairy. We stopped at a dairy,

45:13.257 --> 45:16.842
you know, and they needed some milk for us. We asked 
the guy, they asked the guy, they says, hey, do you

45:16.990 --> 45:20.434
have some milk for the kid? And he said, no, we don't 
have any milk anymore. We just milked the cow about

45:22.757 --> 45:25.680
two hours ago and the milk is gone. And he said, 
well, I got a bottle of champagne. You'd like to

45:28.143 --> 45:29.485
trade that for a bottle of milk? He said, hell yeah, 
we got the milk. So he went over there and traded the

45:31.467 --> 45:33.329
milk for the champagne. Do you feel that your 
personal contributions to the resistance were

45:35.652 --> 45:39.877
worth the danger? Yeah, I felt that what I've done, 
you know, helped. some or matter of fact helped

45:44.952 --> 46:10.892
quite a bit on our particular area that particular 
part of town in nice where we were involved with the

45:44.952 --> 46:10.892
german and especially with the munition people 
where they were taking the ammunition to italy and

45:44.952 --> 46:10.892
i felt a little bit i did you know help to free france 
just very little bit but every little bit count

45:44.952 --> 46:10.892
that's true well thank you very much for this 
interview
