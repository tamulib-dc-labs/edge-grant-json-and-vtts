00:15.657 --> 00:35.594
O'Reed was a white man, a minister, I think, of the 
Unitarian Church, and he was beaten over the head

00:15.657 --> 00:35.594
by some redneck,

00:15.657 --> 00:35.594
and very seriously injured. Well, instead of 
going to the local medical maternity, and he

00:38.590 --> 00:49.186
probably could have been saved now, whether he 
would have had all his faculties or not, I don't

00:38.590 --> 00:49.186
know. But they drove him to Birmingham without any 
medical attention. He was dead. Brain dead. No, he

00:56.798 --> 00:59.182
was a white man. But he was there with the blacks on 
the march. And that was one tragic situation that

01:07.548 --> 01:11.374
might have been avoided in part. I don't know 
whether he could have been saved or not, but the

01:11.735 --> 01:23.694
people were there willing to work with the blacks. 
They were white doctors. This cousin of mine was

01:25.436 --> 01:30.845
one of them. He was a thoracic surgeon. He was 
standing by, hoping that there could be some use.

01:35.898 --> 01:46.397
And then the other person on the march, Violet 
Louza, I think she was a woman from Detroit, a white

01:35.898 --> 01:46.397
woman too. It's funny that the two who were killed 
were white. And she was shot, and I think she was

01:49.783 --> 01:52.708
killed.

01:55.642 --> 02:06.834
because

01:55.642 --> 02:06.834
she was

01:55.642 --> 02:06.834
sitting by some sort of away thing with some 
blacks, and a white woman with blacks. This is an

02:06.854 --> 02:13.241
unpardonable sin, and this other red man. But 
there were things that, I don't know, it seems as if

02:13.261 --> 02:24.012
a great deal of what happened was for the purpose 
confrontation uh for instance martin luther king

02:24.802 --> 02:50.505
and i admire martin luther king a great deal i 
disagree with a lot of his methods of that time but

02:24.802 --> 02:50.505
you see what he was doing and i and i saw this and 
understood this was affirming non-violence but

02:24.802 --> 02:50.505
confronting in order to incite violence, you see, 
against the innocents. And, of course, by that

02:55.895 --> 03:00.380
means, you get a great deal of support. This was 
Gandhi's technique, and this has been the classic

03:00.400 --> 03:08.029
technique through the years. And he was a master at 
it. But, for instance, he would say, if Congress or

03:11.532 --> 03:20.442
the President doesn't do such and such things, 
there's going to be violence in the streets. Well,

03:21.485 --> 03:27.972
partly as a result of his statements, there would 
be violence in Israel. And I think the riots and so

03:27.993 --> 03:40.247
forth took place when he was assassinating an 
outcry in this same block.

03:42.349 --> 03:49.197
But he knew what he was doing. What you saw wasn't 
always what was there. And this was the thing about

03:55.044 --> 04:02.234
Martin Luther King, that I had some reservations. 
As I say, I admired a great many things.

04:07.541 --> 04:08.262
I knew him. I've been in meetings with him and 
spoken to him on a number of occasions. And he

04:14.152 --> 04:17.657
became the great symbol. This was the important 
thing. He became the great symbol to the black

04:19.179 --> 04:24.166
people. And maybe on the basis of what was 
achieved, this was the way it had to be done. I mean,

04:31.335 --> 04:34.760
of course, he was an educated person. He had great 
intelligence and so forth. And he stayed with the

04:38.418 --> 04:41.204
Black Idiot. He never left it in his manner of 
speaking and so forth. Though he could very well

04:47.277 --> 04:51.726
have done it if he chose to. He chose to remain a part 
of that community and to Personally, to me, I think

04:59.478 --> 05:14.053
he really saw assassination,

04:59.478 --> 05:14.053
in a sense. So he could become a great symbol. Like 
that. Or like Kraus. This was his conscious

05:18.497 --> 05:19.118
purpose. He saw his role in history. And he 
certainly has had a tremendous role in history.

05:23.702 --> 05:25.384
And a very constructive and positive role. But it 
was on the basis

05:25.735 --> 05:42.294
of inciting violence against himself

05:25.735 --> 05:42.294
as well. And while I was in the midst of all this, I 
couldn't help it. I don't know, maybe this is why it

05:45.477 --> 05:46.899
happened. And specifically, as a result, in the 
Civil rights actions of, let's see, the 65, the 66,

05:50.052 --> 06:07.040
and Johnson's administration, Martin Luther 
King, and those who worked in this vein made that

05:50.052 --> 06:07.040
possible. For instance, the

06:07.060 --> 06:15.975
letter from the Birmingham jail, and the riots in 
Birmingham, And

06:16.242 --> 06:40.210
then,

06:16.242 --> 06:40.210
of course, when he was assassinated,

06:16.242 --> 06:40.210
the senseless riots took place everywhere in 
Washington and other places. But I don't know what

06:40.230 --> 06:41.532
the final answer to something like this is. This is 
history, and this is the way things have been

06:41.552 --> 06:42.893
accomplished. But you see, we're getting the 
reaction to this politically, because The

06:44.744 --> 07:05.908
people

06:44.744 --> 07:05.908
in the South and otherwise, like Reagan, who, of 
course Reagan considers himself not to be a racist

06:44.744 --> 07:05.908
in any sense, the practical result of a great many 
of his policies is to reverse the civil rights and

06:44.744 --> 07:05.908
the human rights of the nation.

07:10.664 --> 07:36.901
We are paying the price

07:10.664 --> 07:36.901
now, I think,

07:10.664 --> 07:36.901
of some of the excesses of that time, even if it's 
simply to make oneself an object of ours, of those

07:10.664 --> 07:36.901
who are proud of ours. As goodness knows, we still 
have plenty of land in this country with the

07:36.921 --> 07:39.625
freedom to bear arms about

07:41.731 --> 08:09.581
some of the other traditionalist traditions we 
have in this country in terms of violence. If King

08:09.601 --> 08:11.603
and that vein had not come in, how would you see the 
state of the South at the present time? I think

08:12.140 --> 08:22.855
probably there would have been less legislative 
progress and probably more personal progress.

08:22.875 --> 08:31.087
There would be fewer statutes on the books that 
have been pretty largely reversed. And there may

08:31.107 --> 08:39.799
have been more progress in terms of human 
relationships in the Senate. You think that that

08:41.300 --> 08:47.108
by putting in that lava that polarized. In some 
sense it did. I think it was necessary in any event.

08:57.243 --> 09:08.860
But history goes in cycles, and we seem to have been 
pushed back to the other side of the cycle, setting

08:57.243 --> 09:08.860
the progress of the 60s. Well,

09:09.262 --> 09:22.161
starting

09:09.262 --> 09:22.161
in the fifties was pretty important, so they moved 
on through the sixties and into the seventies. I

09:22.181 --> 09:34.639
became pretty disillusioned with a lot of, well, I 
guess you would

09:22.181 --> 09:34.639
say with the radical sheep that came over in the 
late sixties and the seventies. Of course,

09:34.659 --> 09:35.100
Vietnam was a lot of this,

09:36.177 --> 09:46.794
and Martin Luther King moved on to Vietnam in 
question. I couldn't go with a lot of this, of

09:46.814 --> 09:55.006
course, like everybody else. I wish we had never 
gotten it brought in such a situation, and

09:55.026 --> 10:03.720
something had to be done on a confrontational 
level. to

10:04.122 --> 10:34.062
halt this finally with halted but boy we sure left a 
residue of bitterness civil rights revolution

10:04.122 --> 10:34.062
things that happened in the Vietnam period we are a 
polarized society even in the church today that

10:04.122 --> 10:34.062
polarization on

10:34.683 --> 10:56.590
the basis of ideology. It's so overwhelming. You 
can't get around it to be concerned about

10:57.051 --> 10:58.713
humanitarian things and the churches. Most of my 
writing in this book is dealing with this issue.

11:00.299 --> 11:13.595
and how the church actually functions in terms of 
Christian ethics and social action, and so forth.

11:13.615 --> 11:16.359
And I've taken my cue from Bonhoeffer's 
statement. The first task of Christian ethics is

11:16.379 --> 11:25.009
to invalidate

11:16.379 --> 11:25.009
the knowledge of good and evil. To invalidate the 
knowledge of good and evil. Of course, what he was

11:27.112 --> 11:28.213
talking about tendency of the people in the 
churches to prescribe ethically. And this is what

11:34.913 --> 11:43.726
has happened with the fundamentalists today and 
their borrowed majority and so forth. But this is

11:44.507 --> 11:56.025
exactly what the liberals were doing in the last 
generation in prescribing morality for

11:44.507 --> 11:56.025
everybody else. It's a form of pharisaism. 
whether

11:58.147 --> 12:20.654
it's from a conservative or a liberal stance. But I 
think the Christian Church can find a way of

12:20.674 --> 12:23.056
dealing with social issues without this kind of 
ethical restriction. But at any rate, this is a

12:23.076 --> 12:24.458
question I want to explore for all of you. It's been 
fascinating to me because I've been on two sides of

12:25.990 --> 12:32.941
a lot of different issues. Of course, a lot. We 
think in stereotypes today. This whole business

12:36.867 --> 12:45.381
of literally stereotyping

12:36.867 --> 12:45.381
is a stereotype. But you're automatically lumped 
with certain people.

12:55.927 --> 13:03.940
which I've seen so much of Texas A&M lately, 
despite the fact that they've been putting up with

12:55.927 --> 13:03.940
the intersection. So again, students, one of our,

13:03.960 --> 13:14.437
well, it appears that the administration has been 
working in like that. One of the vice presidents in

13:14.457 --> 13:23.031
our student body was put on probationary 
suspension because he was, had voted in the

13:24.057 --> 13:35.009
Student Senate for the approval of this 
organization on the campus.

13:35.649 --> 13:39.514
And he had had like 20 parking tickets. And he had 
probationary suspension because of his tickets.

13:44.779 --> 13:47.983
So he made himself vulnerable there, didn't he? 
Well, he had paid the tickets, though. Anyway, he

13:50.605 --> 13:52.107
took it to court. To the federal court, the same 
judge

13:52.542 --> 14:12.993
that had put in an injunction or something

13:52.542 --> 14:12.993
against the University

13:52.542 --> 14:12.993
of Florida's action against the school. And 
eventually they sent him out of court, and I guess

14:13.013 --> 14:14.756
his father is on the back of it. His tenure is kind of 
outspoken out there. It's an interesting battle

14:15.737 --> 14:18.381
down there, I think.

14:21.584 --> 14:32.195
at A&M of all places to fight over that issue with 
its masculine image of the core and so forth. They

14:32.755 --> 14:34.898
won't let the gals play in the band. Well, 
everything around the campus, like even there's a

14:34.998 --> 14:45.749
statue in some of our student meetings of a man and a 
woman at Kennedy because it's preparing for the

14:34.998 --> 14:45.749
future. The man is just a massive size less than the 
women, and it's so fatiguing. That's the

14:55.631 --> 15:02.119
traditional A&M image of men and women, huh? Yeah. 
The statue's still there, so this is... Well, we

15:02.259 --> 15:14.895
have a lot of traditions to live down, and we're 
making some that all have to be lived down to, I

15:02.259 --> 15:14.895
guess. Do you see, um, have you been following 
South African poems lately, too? Do you see any

15:25.196 --> 15:26.698
similarities?

15:29.901 --> 15:38.529
In fact, it's a reminder, so often, of the way 
things were

15:29.901 --> 15:38.529
in our own Southland. But of course, it's 
magnified many times now, because, um, the

15:45.554 --> 15:49.539
opportunities

15:45.554 --> 15:49.539
have been only for the blacks. There's never been a 
question before about, well, they've had to keep

15:49.559 --> 16:11.224
the black in his place, because the numbers are so 
overwhelming, and yet they had to have the blacks

15:49.559 --> 16:11.224
to do the work and bring them into the cities and so 
forth, and they had these separate There

16:12.014 --> 16:35.852
was a

16:12.014 --> 16:35.852
very close relationship. Segregation began at 
only at certain levels.

16:45.306 --> 16:53.398
Going

16:45.306 --> 16:53.398
to school, or choosing a wife, or dating, and that 
kind of thing. And then there were two distinct

16:53.419 --> 16:54.280
groups. But as far as the personal aspects,

16:54.300 --> 17:05.137
all the blacks were primarily serving positions. 
Still, they had a role. acceptable,

17:07.330 --> 17:29.198
or most of them seem to accept it, but of course that 
kind of situation can't be maintained. But there

17:29.218 --> 17:30.460
is real segregation, and I'll tell you that 
somehow. I just don't see any solution, short of

17:30.480 --> 17:31.501
revolution. When revolution comes, there's no 
answer. I'm

17:33.824 --> 17:58.381
not optimistic

17:33.824 --> 17:58.381
about what could happen. With the liberalization 
of the policies of the whites, maybe that could

17:58.401 --> 18:00.344
stave it off for a while. But eventually, it's on 
its own. Just as it was in the 18th century and in

18:01.025 --> 18:02.127
other places. in

18:04.351 --> 18:28.762
a black state home. Which is a terrible thing to 
happen. That's a mystery. What happened to your

18:29.884 --> 18:30.785
father after that time? What does he end up doing? 
Well, he in

18:31.857 --> 18:48.317
private

18:31.857 --> 18:48.317
farms. Actually, it's a lot of story to it, apart 
from that particular issue.

18:55.785 --> 18:59.870
But during the Depression, the bank failures and 
so forth, we had a pretty rugged time. We lost

18:59.890 --> 19:00.531
everything we had. When I was young, we were pretty 
affluent. By the time I got to high school and off to

19:02.047 --> 19:08.496
college, I was on my own. And

19:08.516 --> 19:26.020
my dad eventually

19:08.516 --> 19:26.020
came back, and so today he was a classic case, and it 
involved blacks again. He had been so identified

19:26.160 --> 19:31.547
with the black community, both in Little Rock and 
El Dorado, There were no black lawyers in those

19:32.422 --> 19:39.051
days, at least not in Arkansas. But this was a 
rather interesting case, and this one case that

19:39.652 --> 19:52.109
provided some financial security for his own 
name, for his and others' own name. The suit was

19:52.470 --> 19:54.833
lost in the lower court. It had to do with the 
inheritance of a slave, or at least a freed slave,

19:59.675 --> 20:08.308
who owned some property and oil was discovered on 
that property. And the question, the legal

20:08.328 --> 20:20.226
question, was who were the valid heirs of this 
Edward? And there were about three sets of heirs.

20:25.966 --> 20:32.693
who were claiming that there was a legitimate 
marriage, a marriage that was on file. This was one

20:33.213 --> 20:36.157
group of children. And then there was another 
earlier marriage, and my father was representing

20:36.177 --> 20:44.025
these heirs. And what he was able to do, from 
documents and otherwise, was to demonstrate that

20:44.565 --> 20:52.453
it was a valid marriage in slave terms. They had 
jumped the boom. And he argued this. He got into it

21:00.815 --> 21:14.014
after it was lost to the court, but they won it 
through the Supreme Court, the Arkansas Supreme

21:00.815 --> 21:14.014
Court. He wrote a nine-page brief and zeroed in on 
one point as well. This he always impressed, as far

21:20.742 --> 21:25.851
as legal matters are concerned. Don't go all over 
the waterfront. Find your valid point and stick

21:28.515 --> 21:36.148
with it, and let all the rest slough off. But in 
these other briefs of hundreds of pages, he wrote a

21:36.168 --> 21:42.058
nine-page brief on one for this group of heirs, and 
he got a look out of this to find some

21:42.545 --> 21:54.700
security for his old age. And I still have on file 
that brief, which was sort of a classic, I think,

21:54.720 --> 22:10.439
that it convinced

21:54.720 --> 22:10.439
the Arkansas Supreme Court. But that issued it. 
later

22:13.190 --> 22:36.576
on, he didn't

22:13.190 --> 22:36.576
get into politics. He was influential in backing 
others. For instance, you know, I mentioned this

22:37.877 --> 22:40.159
Tom McRae, who was president of the Rockefeller 
Foundation, my nephew. Tom is about 6'7", a great

22:40.179 --> 22:41.321
big tall gang of Arkansas guy. He's a lawyer, too. 
But the way Tom McRae came into being, there was an

22:43.447 --> 22:57.244
old congressman who had retired after 25 years in 
Southwestern District of Arkansas. And my dad and

22:57.264 --> 23:08.037
two or three others in the little office, this was 
in the early 20s, were looking for somebody who

22:57.264 --> 23:08.037
could be honest running for governor. And if they 
could find the right man, they would support him,

23:08.725 --> 23:18.694
they would raise funds for him. But Arkansas 
politics had gotten rid of the sands of corruption

23:18.714 --> 23:22.597
and everything else. And so they zeroed in on this 
Congressman Gray, who had retired from Congress.

23:30.945 --> 23:33.787
And I guess he was in his sixties at that time. He 
wanted them to settle down and live in Prescott,

23:33.807 --> 23:37.230
Arkansas. So, Dad and another

23:37.835 --> 23:51.540
man went down to talk to Congress. They hadn't 
known him, they were just knowing about

23:51.901 --> 23:56.189
reputation. They asked him to run for governor and 
support him. At first, they were confused. They

23:58.513 --> 23:59.475
were an old gentleman who wanted to retire. But 
finally, When all the evidence

24:00.515 --> 24:12.337
of the corruption came in, it was like, oh, they 
went back again. Well, he won. He ran. He won. He

24:13.079 --> 24:14.962
served two terms. And that's supposed to be a sort 
of golden age of Arkansas politics, because when

24:14.982 --> 24:23.518
McRae was governor. Well, close friendship 
developed with the families, and my grandmother,

24:24.224 --> 24:35.848
who was living with us in town, and old Mrs. McRae 
became great friends. I remember that, oh, when I

24:35.868 --> 24:44.325
was a child, I must have been a good boy or 
something, because My grandmother, on a couple of

24:44.795 --> 24:51.782
occasions, took me to call the governor's wife, 
took me with her. I guess I just sat there as a good

24:51.803 --> 24:55.386
boy. But I remember the governor's limousine 
coming around, picking up my grandmother,

24:55.466 --> 25:06.618
and going to visit Mrs. McRae. And that kind of 
thing. Well, when my grandmother was dying, we

25:08.040 --> 25:14.667
lived in Alreda at that time, the oldest grave. and

25:15.271 --> 25:28.243
she was driven by a grandson of hers, Carlton. And 
at that time, my older sister was walking in the

25:28.724 --> 25:35.510
camp or something like that. She didn't meet him, 
but years later, Carlton came down the road. He was

25:42.757 --> 25:43.978
a chemist working in the laboratory, flying oil. 
And they were saying, well, when you go down there,

25:44.819 --> 25:51.184
they'd be sure to look up that Rogers girl. And he 
kind of put them out there. He said he would. It took

25:56.309 --> 25:58.411
him a year to get around it. But then things moved 
pretty fast. So my oldest sister married the old

26:01.493 --> 26:06.318
governor's grandson. And their oldest son is 
Thomas C. McRae IV. And that's the time when But

26:14.502 --> 26:27.917
that was the kind of

26:14.502 --> 26:27.917
involvement in politics that he needed to learn 
much, and he was too identified as a nigger logger.

26:28.998 --> 26:36.527
This was a phrase

26:28.998 --> 26:36.527
I heard used too many times. I don't know. He 
accepted

26:38.193 --> 26:47.143
it and became kind of a badge of honor. But the idea

26:47.163 --> 27:06.625
behind it was that, I mean, the deprecating idea 
was that any lawyer who was

26:47.163 --> 27:06.625
low enough to defend niggers, you know what I'm 
saying, was something a little wrong. That's the

27:06.645 --> 27:07.206
way things were. Well, Faubus was sort of a 
throwback.

27:15.213 --> 27:26.578
Faubus, when he was coming along, was a very 
different person. what he was later. You know, he

27:28.980 --> 27:40.632
went to that, what was it, the Commonwealth 
College that was supposed to be a communist

27:28.980 --> 27:40.632
institution, you know? Not that he was a 
communist, but a boy from the backwoods who liked

27:40.652 --> 27:43.555
boggles. He'd go to college where he could, 
ambitious, backwoods boy. But all of us tried a

27:45.457 --> 27:50.061
power play. I don't know if he

27:50.081 --> 27:56.468
was really ever sympathetic to the 
segregationists, but he wouldn't do that. And

27:56.488 --> 27:56.768
Asim Kaur, in

27:57.490 --> 28:21.183
those areas, and refused to send in the troops to 
protect those kids in Central High. No one called

28:21.203 --> 28:22.044
us and took advantage of it. There's a background 
on it. He calls it the power of the country. So I'll

28:23.386 --> 28:24.207
make you later to see what we do. because

28:25.216 --> 28:44.354
it was a lot of trouble that was caused. Well, 
others were vindicated and opposed. It's real

28:45.335 --> 28:46.117
interesting. The Arkansas political scene now is 
very different.

28:51.929 --> 28:58.876
one of the things in

28:51.929 --> 28:58.876
the family that my nephew has often been expected 
to do. His mother, my sister, and

28:58.896 --> 29:17.093
others in the family were expected that he would 
want to go, because he still hasn't met the man that

28:58.896 --> 29:17.093
he still remembered at the start. And Tom has never 
really, he has, worked with somebody. He was,

29:24.166 --> 29:28.811
incidentally, he was the governor's 
administrative assistant. Bumpers. For a long

29:29.072 --> 29:36.560
time, of course,

29:29.072 --> 29:36.560
Bumpers was in the Senate. And he got a lot of solid 
experience

29:36.580 --> 29:42.987
in that situation. But we never really desire to 
run for governor. Before he dies, maybe. Maybe

29:49.456 --> 29:59.070
he'll be persuaded like his great-grandfather.

29:59.130 --> 30:03.857
I think he's gotten a lot of publicity out of it. 
What the Rockefeller Foundation has done is to

30:03.877 --> 30:10.907
identify causes

30:11.832 --> 30:16.782
that need to be pursued. And then to pour money into 
studies, to get professionals who can really deal

30:16.803 --> 30:26.082
with those things. And every time one of his major 
studies has come out, for instance,

30:30.344 --> 30:43.424
they did one of the public schools in Arkansas.

30:43.445 --> 30:46.249
Really, this thing in Texas was modeled after, or 
at least something of the same thing. And they made

30:46.269 --> 30:49.534
some, the foundation report made some

30:50.155 --> 31:10.774
very strong recommendations about public 
schools in Arkansas,

30:50.155 --> 31:10.774
on the caliber of teachers. One of the things I 
noticed in the paper recently, they're doing,

31:10.794 --> 31:15.538
they're testing teachers, and a lot of the 
teachers are protesting this. A lot of the

31:15.558 --> 31:18.981
teachers couldn't pass the tests that the 
students are required to do. Of course, the

31:19.737 --> 31:29.327
unfortunate thing about this is it hits

31:19.737 --> 31:29.327
a lot of black people's situations. There is still 
an

31:29.347 --> 31:41.939
inequality there, an inequality achieved as far 
as objective tests are concerned. And this is a

31:41.959 --> 31:45.643
real concern, and I think the report The

31:46.433 --> 32:05.299
Rockefeller

31:46.433 --> 32:05.299
Foundation put out about it, suggesting making 
judgments about the black

31:46.433 --> 32:05.299
experience and so forth. There'd be a different 
kind of test or something. The way it's come out,

32:08.283 --> 32:09.484
they've all been tested the same way. This is 
inherently unfair. and a lot of the teachers. Of

32:14.126 --> 32:26.782
course, right now, the issue is not so much on the 
black flag

32:14.126 --> 32:26.782
issue, but just another concern of the teachers. 
That's a strong concern in my school, especially

32:26.802 --> 32:39.778
because of that stereotype of the people that are 
in the education majors being literate at all at

32:26.802 --> 32:39.778
our school. put down as far as, you know, if you're 
talking about an age group, they might still go to

32:40.906 --> 32:51.296
art school. I'm concerned that those things could 
be in as far as, you know, education especially.

32:56.521 --> 32:57.622
I don't know. I guess it just goes down. You've got 
the ethnic and being in business or engineering

33:02.306 --> 33:07.791
or something. Well,

33:09.020 --> 33:18.074
of course, this is North Texas' tradition. This 
is, at one time, North Texas State Teachers

33:18.594 --> 33:26.907
College, and our normal school, even before then. 
And the large school of education has to fight

33:26.927 --> 33:36.782
this, because they're trying to upgrade the 
standards. They're

33:37.150 --> 33:54.439
not high in the school of education. This is one of 
the problems. They're leaving some of the

33:55.040 --> 33:55.842
selectivity. They're not just a black community, 
but a white community as well. Education courses

33:58.632 --> 34:05.642
seem to be more passable than content courses. It

34:05.662 --> 34:13.674
creates a problem.

34:15.337 --> 34:27.154
When the students here were getting involved in 
the news here in the 60s, did they participate in

34:15.337 --> 34:27.154
sit-ins and demonstrations and things like that? 
Was there a SNCC, Student Nonviolent Learning

34:28.197 --> 34:33.685
Community? I don't think there was a SNCC on this 
campus, but of course there have been a lot of other

34:33.946 --> 34:42.138
places. But no, there was, I don't know that it 
ever,

34:42.158 --> 34:56.500
the town capitulated pretty fast that first year. 
There were a lot of problems. For instance, blacks

34:59.604 --> 35:17.022
who would

34:59.604 --> 35:17.022
commute in from Dallas,

34:59.604 --> 35:17.022
where would they eat? And we, at our student 
center, we had a sort of a lunch place where people

35:17.042 --> 35:21.186
could come in and bring their sack lunches. Most 
were blacks, but they didn't have anywhere else to

35:21.206 --> 35:24.370
go. And that kind of thing. Well, that lasted all of 
the

35:25.150 --> 35:47.776
confrontations

35:25.150 --> 35:47.776
and things in the community lasted longer than 
that. People just hadn't gotten used to that. The

35:48.597 --> 35:51.040
threat and the boycott of the campus theater by 
some of the students took care of that situation

35:48.597 --> 35:51.040
really well. Because, you know, there was strong 
sympathy among the white students. You know,

35:56.723 --> 35:59.847
there's those two theaters on the square. Was one 
of those originally for blacks? No, no, no, no. The

36:04.834 --> 36:08.840
blacks had to go up and down. It was segregated. 
That was it. It wasn't too separate. No, no. I think

36:14.148 --> 36:16.611
in Bryan there's one. I guess in Bryan there's an 
old theater where there's a back door where they

36:16.631 --> 36:22.059
went in and bought the tickets. Yeah, I remember 
that from childhood. Yeah. Of

36:25.478 --> 36:54.361
course, theaters wouldn't turn away the black 
trade, but they'd just paint them with side

36:25.478 --> 36:54.361
entrants or back entrants and sit up, I doubt, in 
some other place. But those things are no more.

36:54.982 --> 36:55.182
Thank you. I think I've said enough.

38:18.980 --> 38:48.379
All

38:18.980 --> 38:48.379
right.
