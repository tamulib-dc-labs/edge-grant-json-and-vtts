WEBVTT

00:01.651 --> 00:05.117
We're in the conference room at the University of 
Texas at Arlington. I'm interviewing Art

00:05.878 --> 00:11.627
Anjumani, one of the faculty members here in the 
department. Art, could you please clarify for me

00:12.889 --> 00:21.583
the two entities you have here in the department? 
the urban studies and then the city and regional

00:22.441 --> 00:27.475
planning. OK. We have here Institute of Urban 
Studies. That is an institute mandated by the

00:33.031 --> 00:36.822
state of Texas. and acting as sort of school. And 
the city and regional planning program is, in some

00:41.910 --> 00:50.439
senses, like a division inside this sort of school 
that we have. So the Institute of Urban Studies is

00:50.920 --> 00:54.544
the umbrella organization. Inside this 
organization, there is a three-degree granting

00:55.044 --> 01:02.893
division or department or whatever you are 
calling that. And there is also other divisions,

01:03.076 --> 01:08.382
such as research and training, et cetera. All 
these are inside the Institute of Urban Studies.

01:12.367 --> 01:20.898
City and regional planning is a sort of 
department, as I said, and supposedly should have

01:12.367 --> 01:20.898
been called department. But the university, a 
couple of years ago, has decided that They are not

01:27.528 --> 01:34.112
going to go with separate budget lines for the 
professional schools. And they considered the

01:34.362 --> 01:42.734
institute and we inside them as professional 
schools, such as architecture, et cetera. And

01:43.535 --> 01:48.642
they only gave one budget line to each one of these 
schools. So the whole institute right now has only

01:48.662 --> 01:52.468
one budget line. And because of that, we cannot 
have separate departments inside such schools,

01:52.488 --> 02:01.180
such as Institute of Urban Studies. Therefore, 
that's why we call City Energy on the Planet as a

02:01.160 --> 02:05.533
program. And we have other degree granting, which 
is urban and regional affairs program. And we have

02:14.608 --> 02:16.851
also a PhD in administration. These are the three 
degrees that we have right now in the society. It's

02:20.015 --> 02:22.378
a PhD in urban administration? No, PhD in 
administration. It's only administration.

02:26.443 --> 02:27.304
Planned administration. And we are sharing that 
with business school. I see. You don't have a PhD

02:32.110 --> 02:34.373
in? a planning-related topic. No, we don't have 
direct PhD in planning-related topics. Inside

02:41.501 --> 02:55.538
that PhD in administration, there is a major in 
city and regional planning, which is relatively

02:41.501 --> 02:55.538
small major, rather than they have something 
above major as a primary or something. I don't

02:55.578 --> 02:57.120
remember what's the name. But one inside that 
Ph.D. program, basically getting Ph.D. in

02:57.100 --> 03:10.254
administration, can have a major in city and 
regional planning, which is not equivalent to

02:57.100 --> 03:10.254
Ph.D. in planning at all. It would be more or less an 
emphasis. It is like emphasis.

03:18.563 --> 03:20.425
How long has the... city and regional planning 
program been in existence? Do you know when it was

03:25.238 --> 03:26.640
created? Those I'll need to go back to our, you 
know, books and our things. I came here at 1979 and I

03:31.587 --> 03:40.438
believe at that time the program was in existence 
perhaps for I would say for six years then. I'm not

03:43.183 --> 03:45.087
sure exactly when. Joel would be a better person to 
know exact date because he was one of the people

03:45.388 --> 03:53.143
that basically put the program together. He was 
hard, I think, to do that. All right. How many

03:58.574 --> 04:00.638
students... do you normally enroll 
approximately every year?

04:06.428 --> 04:11.097
You know that in planning programs, normally 
these things go up and down. And especially in this

04:11.638 --> 04:19.251
program, since my being here, we have been always 
in different situations depending on what was

04:11.638 --> 04:19.251
going on. Overall, up to a couple of years ago, we 
were somewhere between 20 to 30 students going

04:19.231 --> 04:30.210
back and forth. In the last two years, our 
enrollment drastically has increased. Right now

04:37.483 --> 04:43.534
we have quite drastically, of course I mean in 
terms of our small program. We have about 40

04:43.514 --> 04:46.497
students. I think we have about 44, 42, something 
like that. And perhaps for next year, we're going

04:50.120 --> 04:55.485
to be about 40 some. But after that, no one knows. 
You know that planning programs overall, you're

04:57.867 --> 05:01.330
losing students. So I would think that at the most, 
we're going to stay in 40. Or perhaps we're going to

05:05.694 --> 05:11.479
go back to 20-some that we were one time before. 
Looking at your program here, what would you

05:12.927 --> 05:22.463
characterize as its major emphasis? How do you 
feel that it can be identified? What sort of

05:28.072 --> 05:33.180
planning program do you have? I would approach 
that in this way, that at the beginning when I was

05:33.430 --> 05:44.916
here, we had a program which basically trained 
generalized type of, generalist type of

05:33.430 --> 05:44.916
planning. And we had that for several years, and 
even though we were encouraging the students to

05:45.778 --> 05:52.333
sort of specialize, both because of the structure 
of the program and perhaps also because of the

05:52.499 --> 06:00.371
expertise of the faculty. It seems to me it was 
difficult to specialize at those years. Then a

06:05.679 --> 06:11.368
couple of years ago we went through a major effort 
to revise the program. And as revision, we changed

06:11.500 --> 06:16.547
the number of units required. Basically, right 
now, we are requiring 48 credit hours.

06:22.655 --> 06:32.648
And as part of that, we try to bring the program out 
of generalist approach and explicitly encourage

06:22.655 --> 06:32.648
students to specialize. And according to 
resources of our faculty, by that I mean the areas

06:33.629 --> 06:41.119
that they are involved and they can teach, et 
cetera, We came up with a scheme which is sort of

06:41.217 --> 06:58.879
Chinese menu type scheme and people can mix and 
match the courses and the areas but basically we

06:41.217 --> 06:58.879
offer three major areas of specialization which 
inside each one of those there are focus areas of

06:41.217 --> 06:58.879
specialization. Those three areas are first land 
related things. We call that land development

07:03.524 --> 07:05.807
scheme. and inside of this there are land use 
planning, urban design, real estate development

07:05.787 --> 07:17.745
or whatever you can think that is related to 
physical planning and especially land. It is

07:18.226 --> 07:19.468
inside this one. The second one is sort of 
socio-economic type of planning and again inside

07:20.169 --> 07:34.090
of that there are different specializations such 
as housing or policy oriented transportation

07:20.169 --> 07:34.090
etc. And third one is more number crunching, 
computer-oriented analysis, heavy

07:34.778 --> 07:43.752
quantitative analysis type of specialization. 
And then, of course, we allow that students can

07:44.653 --> 07:48.820
even mix and match with these things. For example, 
if someone going to land use planning may like to

07:48.920 --> 08:03.182
have a good knowledge of computers, so they're 
going to take a couple of the computer-related

07:48.920 --> 08:03.182
ones and some of the hardcore of land use 
development or whatever. But basically this is

08:03.162 --> 08:05.392
all we have. I see. Do you have what? might be 
regarded as a core curriculum of minimum courses

08:10.520 --> 08:14.987
that everyone... Yes, we have inside this 
program, we have a core area or core courses, which

08:15.007 --> 08:22.379
I believe are about 41 hours. As I promised, I'm 
going to give you the summary of the program,

08:22.399 --> 08:28.709
basically. There are about 21 hours or 24 hours of 
the core courses, which... About half. So it is 21.

08:38.028 --> 08:38.829
This is a little less than that. A little less, 
yeah. And inside that, we also have two project lab

08:40.231 --> 08:52.586
or laboratory, which is normally required, but 
some programs may not put inside the core areas.

08:52.606 --> 08:54.288
They are put directly in core area. So if you reduce 
that, so it would be six minus 21 would be 15 hour of

08:54.728 --> 09:03.038
core courses, then two project labs. and then 
every specialization area that one is selecting

09:03.018 --> 09:21.955
to go in would be five courses or 15 hours required 
two of those five courses are required which is

09:03.018 --> 09:21.955
mandated what courses they are And three would be 
elected on the basis of the sub-area of

09:21.935 --> 09:33.347
specialization, that focus area of 
sub-specialization that I said, which would be

09:21.935 --> 09:33.347
selected by the advisor and the students design. 
And then I believe we have about 12 hours of

09:33.988 --> 09:40.976
electives, depending on if they are doing thesis 
or exam or whatever. Because if they go thesis

09:41.036 --> 09:45.501
route, they have to spend some of those for their 
thesis. Otherwise, if they are doing

09:46.041 --> 09:51.267
comprehensive exam, the whole 12 hours is open for 
electives. The electives, we heavily encourage

09:51.550 --> 09:56.856
the students to use those also for 
specialization. So hopefully four courses there

09:58.477 --> 10:12.593
and five courses there, so nine courses we try to 
use for specialization, the students to

09:58.477 --> 10:12.593
basically get some knowledge of the area that they 
think they are specializing. Do you require an

10:12.613 --> 10:14.074
internship? Yes, we require internship, but 
students don't get credit for registering for

10:14.655 --> 10:20.241
internship. That was one of the means that we 
reduced our logs. We give them one credit hour. One

10:27.483 --> 10:28.485
credit hour. That's not a bad idea. We never 
thought of that. Otherwise, perhaps we would have

10:31.853 --> 10:34.399
done it. There was a big debate about it, and it 
varied substantially depending upon the

10:35.206 --> 10:44.279
student's committee chairman in the past. And it 
was so flexible that it created some problems

10:45.380 --> 10:59.420
among the students, because some would say, well, 
I worked all summer and I only got one credit hour,

10:45.380 --> 10:59.420
and another worked six weeks and he or she got 
three. And so we decided everybody should get one.

11:04.265 --> 11:07.710
Yours is semester system or quarter? Semester. 
Semester. We've always been semester. You're on

11:11.014 --> 11:12.176
semester. Yeah, we are semester too. Okay.

11:18.024 --> 11:33.985
Your general perception of planning education in 
Texas, what role do you see UT Arlington's efforts

11:18.024 --> 11:33.985
taking with respect to the statewide view of 
planning education? I would admit that I am not

11:35.872 --> 11:44.665
that much familiar with the other two programs, 
your program and also us in program. I know overall

11:44.765 --> 11:57.525
that these two programs are there and I know some of 
the faculties like you and I have seen their

11:44.765 --> 11:57.525
curriculum before but right now I don't really 
know that what are the difference between the

11:44.765 --> 11:57.525
programs. I would say our program in comparison to 
some of the national programs that I know, is

12:01.049 --> 12:18.156
perhaps a little more oriented toward practice of 
planning than upon their type of theories or

12:01.049 --> 12:18.156
philosophical discussions or something of that 
nature. And I personally like it to be that way. I

12:23.324 --> 12:25.948
always consider planning as a profession. I guess 
all of us consider planning as a profession. And I

12:29.213 --> 12:38.264
like to see that, like any professional schools, 
we are training our students to come out as actual

12:29.213 --> 12:38.264
planners and to use what they have learned at 
schools. Of course, as you know, planning hasn't

12:38.905 --> 12:44.853
been developed as much as, say, engineering or 
civil engineering or something. So we are

12:45.553 --> 12:50.700
attempting to do that, but we have limitations in 
doing that. And of course, because of that,

12:50.780 --> 12:56.487
perhaps, and also educational type of 
philosophies, there would be always theoretical

12:56.467 --> 13:03.576
courses such as planning theory or those type of 
things around, and we have those. But I overall see

13:04.577 --> 13:17.213
that our programs, in comparison to some of the 
programs that I've seen up in North or in the West

13:04.577 --> 13:17.213
Coast, is more geared toward actual applied 
planning. And I think that's what we need in Texas,

13:18.475 --> 13:22.660
in my view, because Nothing much has been done in 
Texas, planning relatively new in comparison to

13:22.640 --> 13:29.188
the rest of the nation in Texas. Therefore, we need 
people to come out of these schools and go and apply

13:29.929 --> 13:34.695
things. But on the other hand, one thinking that 
way may be sort of misled to think that if we are

13:35.997 --> 13:46.690
saying apply, we necessarily talk about applied 
planning in city which normally end up to be land

13:47.345 --> 14:02.687
use related those type of things of course that to 
me is sort of core of planning on the other hand

13:47.345 --> 14:02.687
there are lots of other aspects of planning that we 
try also to bring them about and those would be

14:02.920 --> 14:11.093
applied, maybe eventually end up as policy 
analysis or something for a department or even a

14:02.920 --> 14:11.093
private organization. But I meant mostly to have 
some application to discussions that we are

14:11.213 --> 14:18.826
having in class or whatever. There seems to be 
almost an untapped resource for planners in

14:18.846 --> 14:27.139
corporate planning. and corporate affairs and 
what many of their job descriptions call for can be

14:27.895 --> 14:38.583
termed planning. But they don't call it that 
because they're not they're coming at it from a

14:41.716 --> 14:43.818
different perspective. In fact, up to a year or a 
year and a half ago, the growth was a big thing in

14:43.938 --> 14:57.773
Texas, especially real estate growth was a big 
thing here. We had lots of applicants that they

14:58.774 --> 15:08.063
were coming here that their aim wasn't to go and 
work in public agencies at all. They were planning

15:08.083 --> 15:11.487
to come and get the degree and go to a private 
sector, and mostly they wanted to go to real estate

15:12.091 --> 15:26.689
development, either in business for themselves, 
or they wanted to be hard first with the real estate

15:12.091 --> 15:26.689
development firms and eventually go for 
themselves also. Perhaps now it has been to reduce

15:27.250 --> 15:34.680
those type of people, but I see real demand outside 
the people. And some of these, incidentally, they

15:35.140 --> 15:39.786
had degrees, MBA degrees even. business degrees, 
and they realize that what they need they have to

15:40.036 --> 15:46.582
learn in those type of environments. And that 
perhaps is true in your program. I don't know if you

15:48.584 --> 15:50.926
had similar experiences. Well, we did. And we 
created a new degree, the MSLD, Master of Science

15:52.247 --> 16:01.776
in Land Development. And it was the right program 
at the wrong time. About the time it got started,

16:05.919 --> 16:09.823
the bottom fell out of the construction industry. 
so that enrollment has fallen off perceptibly

16:10.394 --> 16:17.824
every semester. And it's a good program, but it 
just simply consumed, I think, an inordinate

16:19.025 --> 16:35.146
amount of time of our faculty and our resources at a 
time when we should have been bolstering the MUP

16:19.025 --> 16:35.146
degree. What's the MUP degree? The Master of Urban 
Planning. Oh, OK. Yours is a Master of City and

16:40.567 --> 16:43.771
Regional Planning? City and Regional Planning. 
MCRP. MCRP. Yeah. So, let's see, you offer the PhD

16:47.957 --> 16:54.266
and the dissertation, the MCRP, and what other 
degree? Well, what we call it, ORBA, it is Urban and

16:54.746 --> 16:58.011
Regional Affairs. Urban, what is it, a Bachelor's 
or Master's? Master's. It's MA degree in Urban and

17:01.716 --> 17:04.940
Regional Affairs. Basically, Urban Affairs 
program. Uh-huh. Well, a lot of affairs are urban.

17:12.521 --> 17:24.680
Yeah, but I guess rather than saying it's 
basically an urban affair program, I should have

17:12.521 --> 17:24.680
said that it basically is getting closer to public 
administration side of the issues. I see. We may in

17:27.260 --> 17:31.785
future try to get a public administration degree 
or so. I don't know. But we don't have such a degree.

17:34.288 --> 17:36.430
So this, I think, is some sort of substitute. 
People who are going to work in the urban

17:38.553 --> 17:44.759
environment, but not necessarily interested in 
the planning side of it. I am not that familiar with

17:45.280 --> 17:49.064
the program, so I can't give you more information. 
But my understanding is that there is good

17:49.144 --> 17:55.191
differences between that program and our 
program. In your MCRP degree program, what is your

17:55.610 --> 18:02.356
faculty-student ratio? Of course, since we said 
the student number were changing very quickly

18:04.218 --> 18:14.967
almost, I would think that the faculty-student 
ratio also would change very quickly. Basically,

18:16.949 --> 18:20.412
we have... I don't know, the faculty members are a 
little loose here. Three people, 100%, I can see

18:26.474 --> 18:34.206
that they're always involved in teaching and 
everything of planning. Then in addition to

18:34.709 --> 18:39.835
those, we have Bob Wagner, who also teach in 
planning all the time. In addition to those, also,

18:40.436 --> 18:47.825
as you know, he does that, what's that, the 
newsletter for Texas planners. He's editor of

18:48.346 --> 18:54.493
that, and recently you all given that Texas 
planner thing to him, too. So he's another faculty

18:55.194 --> 18:57.918
member always there. We have Paul Guizzo. 
supposedly sort of half-and-half with us. We have

19:06.062 --> 19:08.045
another faculty of that nature. I don't know if you 
have met him or not. Jim Corneil. He is also

19:12.270 --> 19:15.274
supposedly half-and-half with us. What's his 
other half? The Orba and Ph.D. programs. These are

19:20.201 --> 19:25.488
all people that I'm talking right now are in the 
institute. Then we have Andrew Seidel. who is a

19:28.237 --> 19:33.784
person with, I believe his bachelor's degree is 
architecture, if I am right. But he has a master's

19:34.184 --> 19:37.448
in city and regional planning from Harvard. And 
then he has a PhD in planning from, I believe,

19:38.029 --> 19:41.994
Michigan. So he is a planner, and he teaches 
planning type of courses. And his situation with

19:48.122 --> 19:51.966
us is sort of vague. Supposedly, he should be with 
us. I mean, name-wise and teaching-wise, et

19:54.109 --> 19:57.433
cetera. But he was hired before our move from 
architecture to here by the Orbaugh program and

19:57.532 --> 20:06.815
the PhD program. So officially, he was hired with 
them. But right now that we are here, he's also with

20:09.547 --> 20:12.631
us. So he's also editor of the Journal of 
Architecture and Planning Research. So he is,

20:22.462 --> 20:29.390
again, an our faculty member, in my mind, can be 
easily 100% planning. But he happened to be at

20:30.171 --> 20:33.715
least officially under other So we are dealing 
with that. We are trying to bring him basically to

20:36.037 --> 20:40.102
our program as much as we can. And he teaches 
planning-related courses. He teaches urban

20:44.406 --> 20:46.548
design courses. Urban design is one of his 
specialty. And he teaches urban geography and

20:49.491 --> 20:56.098
introduction to planning and those type of 
things. But some of these courses before our move

20:56.438 --> 21:02.925
to here has been part of their programs. So those 
courses attract the students both from our

21:02.905 --> 21:08.191
program and also from their programs. When you say 
their, you're talking about... I am talking about

21:10.014 --> 21:12.797
that urban affair program that time. So they had 
those type of courses prior to movement of city and

21:12.917 --> 21:19.385
regional planning out of architecture to here. 
They had those courses. And it was hard to teach

21:21.608 --> 21:23.490
those courses. That's why he was here. I see. the 
structure is a little bit complex. Yeah, it is.

21:29.878 --> 21:33.783
And, you know, we have also gone through a major 
change in the last two, three years. As I said, the

21:34.203 --> 21:38.769
university changed their attitude about the 
professional schools. And we had another major

21:39.570 --> 21:43.235
big program inside the institute. The institute, 
for some reason, I don't know the detail, decided

21:43.796 --> 21:50.424
that they don't want that program inside the 
institute. That was criminal justice program.

21:52.687 --> 22:17.192
and at least for now that has gone out of the 
institute to other I believe it's in liberal arts

21:52.687 --> 22:17.192
or somewhere so when they moved out then the that 
caused when you are overall small organization

21:52.687 --> 22:17.192
when a major part goes out the relationship 
between others also gonna change and we are in that

21:52.687 --> 22:17.192
mood of change now we are changing constantly and I 
think we are opening up more to each other. I'm

22:21.617 --> 22:27.706
seeing as a trend inside our organization that we 
open up our courses to their students. They open up

22:27.726 --> 22:29.328
their courses to us. Our faculty to teach also for 
them, their faculty to teach for us. In fact, we

22:34.376 --> 22:42.127
have had good faculty inside their faculty that 
perfectly would have fit in my mind. I'm saying my

22:42.227 --> 22:44.310
personal ideas. In my mind, some of their courses 
would have been excellent for our students. Like,

22:48.281 --> 22:51.129
for example, we had the cost-benefit course. I 
think that's exactly a course we need. Then we have

22:54.779 --> 22:59.532
there... By we have, I mean in those programs. We 
have public finance courses, which are

22:59.512 --> 23:06.418
traditionally being taught in planning 
programs. And those are being taught in those two

23:07.219 --> 23:10.062
programs. So we have lots of courses like that. And 
then we have statistic courses that we teach here

23:12.664 --> 23:18.390
that can go also to be taught there. And all those 
type of things that we've got to work it out to

23:18.790 --> 23:27.578
basically improve the quality for students. for 
also the faculty to be able to be involved in all of

23:27.878 --> 23:35.972
these.

23:35.992 --> 23:41.481
Strangely enough, as I was telling you, I teach a 
statistics course here in the planning program.

23:41.942 --> 23:45.889
And as you know, my background and education has 
been first in architecture. In fact, I have been a

23:46.309 --> 23:53.802
practicing architect for 10, 15 years before even 
starting my planning education. Where did you get

23:53.984 --> 23:55.989
your degree in architecture? Back home. I got a 
master's degree in architecture back in

23:56.851 --> 24:01.603
University of Tehran. Did you study with Dr. 
Mozayeni? No, Mozayeni came to teach there when I

24:04.902 --> 24:12.837
was almost at the, you know, doing the final thesis 
and all things. You might have known Tabibian.

24:14.540 --> 24:19.870
Yeah, Tabibian was just two years ahead of me in the 
architecture program. I see. Then I was also, when

24:20.491 --> 24:28.446
I was practicing architects back in Iran, 
Tabibian and I were both in a supposedly some sort

24:28.848 --> 24:32.875
of doctorate program in planning that they had 
there. And he was, again, a year or two ahead of me.

24:38.847 --> 24:41.231
And he got a special scholarship from them. And he 
went, I forgot, to Eastern Europe or somewhere. to

24:44.457 --> 24:46.439
get a degree from there. I forgot where. He got some 
sort of degree and came back and started to teach

24:47.861 --> 24:51.726
there, I heard. I think he was in the United States, 
too. Was he? I don't know. I've forgotten exactly.

24:58.214 --> 25:11.511
So in any event... We have that in common, then, 
because I was a Fulbright assignment to the

24:58.214 --> 25:11.511
University of Tehran for the fall of 1978. Yeah, 
you told me that it's such a bad year that all the

25:11.812 --> 25:15.156
revolutions start. Yeah, bad timing. Bad timing. 
But in my case, I never finalized that degree. In

25:21.523 --> 25:27.110
fact, I don't believe that that degree program 
stayed there, that PhD type of program that they

25:21.523 --> 25:27.110
had. And I was basically, I was a little 
dissatisfied with what I was learning, so I quit

25:27.770 --> 25:33.617
that. I was practicing architecture until 1974 
that I came here. I immigrated in 1974. I didn't

25:41.078 --> 25:42.880
come to go to school here. I basically came as an 
architect to work. And my wife basically pushed me

25:46.346 --> 25:50.392
to go to planning school. I wanted to go to urban 
design program in either UCLA or USC. Did you move

25:55.440 --> 25:56.602
to California? Yeah, we moved to California. I had 
a friend there at UCLA. And he had gone to an urban

26:00.428 --> 26:04.074
design program there. I don't know urban design or 
architecture, whatever, but they sort of

26:04.855 --> 26:09.343
specialized in urban design. And my wife sort of 
pushed me. She was also an architect from the

26:12.808 --> 26:15.252
University of Tehran. She is an architect from the 
University of Tehran. She wouldn't be allowed to

26:17.857 --> 26:20.641
go to school right now. Yeah, right now, I don't 
know. Is that true? In any event, we end up in

26:25.268 --> 26:27.610
planning program. I was just telling you that I am 
coming from heavy design background. I was

26:31.133 --> 26:32.554
basically designer. Even in the architect 
offices, I normally acted as a designer. I wasn't a

26:36.317 --> 26:39.340
working drawing type of man. And then I got a little 
fascination with the quantitative application

26:40.181 --> 26:46.406
of planning. That's why I shifted my education 
there. And when I came here, they basically hired

26:50.289 --> 26:54.853
me to teach mostly quantitative courses. And I 
started to teach statisticals. And I have my

26:58.199 --> 27:11.121
beliefs that I think it is perhaps better if 
someone can teach statistics and especially

26:58.199 --> 27:11.121
other non-statistical quantitative methods. to 
planning students if he himself is a planner and I

27:11.202 --> 27:32.670
have my reasons and I don't want to take your time 
going to all those details, but basically

27:11.202 --> 27:32.670
statistics by itself is very dry and boring 
material and if you go to statistician to teach

27:11.202 --> 27:32.670
those things to you they're gonna go to such a 
length of materials that that I would say 95% of the

27:32.650 --> 27:41.218
things won't be things that you actually would 
need if you become an applied planner. And I can say

27:42.479 --> 27:47.544
that bravely because I have taught that course now 
for eight, nine years. And from the beginning, I

27:48.365 --> 27:56.253
started to copy the course that I had with my 
teacher back when I was in the planning programs.

27:57.093 --> 27:59.856
And that person even was semi-planner. what I 
realized with these years of teaching that so many

28:00.275 --> 28:05.712
materials are really excessive we don't need 
those we don't need all those proofs we don't need

28:06.890 --> 28:30.670
all those talking about so many details we only 
need to know what's the concept and how that can be

28:06.890 --> 28:30.670
applied i don't mean that my course by now is 
perfect course i still you know revising and every

28:06.890 --> 28:30.670
day i'm changing realizing more and more that what 
really at least in our program our students are not

28:06.890 --> 28:30.670
going to go mostly to PhD program or if they go they 
have to take an R-statistic course. So basically

28:35.918 --> 28:49.477
we are teaching these things to these students to 
go outside and if ever they needed to apply

28:35.918 --> 28:49.477
something of statistical nature to remember 
those and to have some concepts what's the whole

28:35.918 --> 28:49.477
thing about. And I think this view would change 
what you are teaching to them. That's why I think

28:52.562 --> 28:56.387
that would be better overall if a planner with 
experience in planning, and especially to

28:56.367 --> 29:04.123
experience a little in the physical side of it, to 
teach them statistics. Of course, it would be

29:04.143 --> 29:09.354
difficult to find such a rare combination, and I 
guess I'm one of the rare ones. But I don't think

29:09.454 --> 29:13.062
that students love my course. They don't like my 
course either. Statistics is... Strange topic,

29:16.870 --> 29:18.533
you know. Some people are good and they would like 
it. Some people have difficulty of understanding

29:21.218 --> 29:27.930
what is this whole thing about and what's the 
application of it. Some students may think at the

29:28.090 --> 29:34.221
end of any statistical course, so what? We know all 
these techniques, what we can do with those,

29:34.201 --> 29:47.435
especially students coming from architecture 
school, et cetera, that they have learned to have

29:34.201 --> 29:47.435
something, and they sit down and come up with a 
product, which is a finished and meaningful

29:34.201 --> 29:47.435
product. And I think it would be difficult to tell 
them what they are, unless that you are also

29:48.597 --> 29:58.868
understanding where they are coming from and what 
they are saying to you. Just a view of the

29:58.888 --> 30:02.031
statistics I talked about. But let me complete 
that if we have time. Let's see how our tape is doing

30:07.008 --> 30:10.132
here. This is the other course that we have in our 
program. We call that method course. And that's

30:16.619 --> 30:24.107
non-statistical, but mostly quantitative type 
of planning-related methods. I really think that

30:24.127 --> 30:28.312
that is more important than statistics to 
planners. And it is good if someone, an actual

30:29.273 --> 30:33.638
planner, teaches those courses rather than a 
scientist or something. What sort of methods do

30:37.303 --> 30:38.946
you include? In that one, I teach also that course. 
I have about five, six, seven basic topics inside.

30:46.857 --> 30:50.783
One is basically land use models. And I think the 
importance of the land use models, which is mostly

30:50.898 --> 31:00.192
mathematical models, is not really that they're 
going to go and apply those models because it might

30:50.898 --> 31:00.192
be difficult for them. But I think conceptually it 
is very important that they know how

31:00.653 --> 31:14.273
scientifically they can view the urban area and 
analyze the structure of urban area and know

31:00.653 --> 31:14.273
what's causing what.
