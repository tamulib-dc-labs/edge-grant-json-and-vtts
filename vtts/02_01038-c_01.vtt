WEBVTT

00:03.676 --> 00:10.627
I had come to New York, and when I came to New York on 
NMU business, I usually stayed in the apartment in

00:03.676 --> 00:10.627
the NMU building.

00:13.491 --> 00:22.786
And Perry came in one night and said, Hoyt, I've 
just worked out the situation on the officer's

00:13.491 --> 00:22.786
slate. I want to see what you think of it. So he 
started that. Mel Beresik, to replace Joe. Then

00:33.005 --> 00:37.872
went on down the officers, and I said, well, let's 
go back to your number one. Why did you select Mel

00:39.134 --> 00:42.659
Barisik as the number one?

00:45.904 --> 00:48.628
He said, well, because he always does what he's 
told to do. I said, well, that's not a very good

00:48.648 --> 00:55.097
reason as long as you're telling him what to do, 
because you're usually telling him the wrong

00:48.648 --> 00:55.097
thing to do. So Perry said, what do you mean by that? 
I said, well, I mean such things as you telling them

00:58.840 --> 01:09.781
to go down and shake down the steamship company for 
$5,000 for this and $5,000 for that, so it will go in

00:58.840 --> 01:09.781
your pocket. He said, I don't think that's a good 
reason for selecting a man to be president of the

01:09.801 --> 01:15.552
union.

01:18.517 --> 01:18.958
So.

01:23.005 --> 01:24.908
I said, I don't think he ought to be president. I 
think Shannon Wall ought to be president. Oh, he's

01:28.775 --> 01:30.938
a bunch of bullshit. I said, he's only a bunch of 
bullshit because you can't drive him around all

01:30.958 --> 01:35.446
the time and tell him what to do. That's not enough 
reason. This was some time before the thing

01:40.554 --> 01:46.684
finally came to head, maybe four or five months. So 
he kept fussing around with this. And he finally

01:51.026 --> 01:54.511
said, well, I finally decided that you're right. 
It ought to be Shannon Wall. And about that time, he

01:55.792 --> 01:57.635
got fired. Not over that issue, but other issues. 
But this

02:02.261 --> 02:08.650
is the kind of a guy he was. All he wanted to do was 
control things. He found out that he could control

02:12.455 --> 02:17.262
Joe not by, trying to pay him off with anything, but 
by just using his ego.

02:25.408 --> 02:34.616
But

02:25.408 --> 02:34.616
Joe again had decided to go after Mel Barisi.

02:37.619 --> 02:43.444
And I said, Joe,

02:37.619 --> 02:43.444
I don't want to influence you on this. I want you to 
make your own decision, which you always do. For

02:47.347 --> 02:49.771
God's sake, go home and think about this. Remember 
that Mel Berezik is going to replace Joe Kern. He's

02:57.963 --> 03:05.214
not only got to carry on what Joe Kern has carried on 
in the past, but he's got to build on that in the

02:57.963 --> 03:05.214
future. And you go home and think about this and 
think in terms of, is he the man that you really

03:06.736 --> 03:15.970
think can carry this union on to the heights to 
which you have brought it.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.402
That's all I had to say to him. The next day, he 
called Shannon Wall and said, I want you to come to

03:29.125 --> 03:35.853
Florida with me. And that's when he decided to put 
Shannon Wall in as president. And subsequently

03:44.302 --> 03:46.224
retire himself. And then he retired.

03:50.527 --> 03:52.550
But you know, it's a funny thing. Joe wouldn't 
retire until after I retired.

03:58.019 --> 04:04.308
And at this time, Joe and I were on very bad personal 
terms over our job. Over Perry? Perry and his son.

04:10.298 --> 04:11.339
Joe's son? Yeah.

04:15.502 --> 04:23.830
But even in those bad times, you feel that Joe Kern 
considered you as a very trusted counsel. Yes, I

04:23.850 --> 04:24.631
do. I still think he trusted my word because I had 
proved right too many times to him on the Perry

04:25.051 --> 04:36.783
thing was the last thing. He couldn't help but 
recognize what I had been telling him to be the

04:36.863 --> 04:43.770
truth for so long. See, I had delivered to him in 
writing names and dates and amounts on Perry of

04:45.742 --> 04:59.599
shaking down steamship corners,

04:45.742 --> 04:59.599
which he wouldn't believe.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.924
Then he found out they were true. He found out from 
one of the companies, too. Said, sure, we paid

05:08.230 --> 05:10.052
Perry off. We paid him over a half million dollars 
to get rid of our passenger ships.

05:19.610 --> 05:24.136
Well, in your opinion, what was the result of the 
loss of the passenger ship contracts to the NMU?

05:25.317 --> 05:26.599
Loss of half of their membership.

05:30.984 --> 05:37.552
And you feel that Perry was at least indirectly, if 
not directly, responsible for that? I'm sure the

05:37.572 --> 05:40.816
steamship companies could prove that he was 
responsible. I can't.

05:44.781 --> 05:48.165
And now that's something you don't want to put in 
your write-up. I'm not asking for lawsuits, which

05:49.664 --> 05:52.388
I can't prove. Absolutely. Just briefly, going 
back to the 1945, 47, and 49 conventions, where the

05:54.752 --> 06:11.959
communists, particularly under Stack and under 
Myers, and later Lawrenson, decided to take

05:54.752 --> 06:11.959
Curran on and attempt to remove him. Who was 
directing Joe Curran? Nobody. Helping him fight

06:15.605 --> 06:17.207
against him? I was certainly meeting with him. I'm 
trying to remember who was attorneys then. If it

06:24.325 --> 06:27.931
was Cooper, Cooper was trying to help him. I don't 
know whether Cooper was there then or not. What

06:31.135 --> 06:32.297
about William L. Standard? I think Standard was 
gone by that time. I'm just not sure.

06:40.810 --> 06:42.553
Standard would not have been helping him.

06:46.381 --> 06:49.285
So any tactics that were used to help maneuver?

06:52.009 --> 06:53.251
They were Joe's. They were Joe's. Nobody else's 
but Joe's. It was literally the personal, his

06:59.199 --> 07:07.310
personal weight, his personal relations with the 
seamen. Because the commies had that convention

07:07.330 --> 07:15.021
well organized

07:07.330 --> 07:15.021
and Some of the commies themselves voted against 
Stack because they could not perceive the union

07:16.064 --> 07:26.003
without a Joe Curran as president.

07:28.908 --> 07:33.938
In the 1947 convention, where Joe is much better 
organized, Where was this convention? Boston?

07:39.150 --> 07:41.172
I'm not sure where that one was located. One of the 
persons I interviewed mentioned that one of the

07:42.273 --> 08:03.992
techniques that Joe used in order to keep the floor 
open to comments from people who were more

07:42.273 --> 08:03.992
favorable toward him was to outmaneuver Stack and 
his followers who had, as you mentioned, had

07:42.273 --> 08:03.992
organized very well for the 45 convention. Do you 
know of any techniques that Joe Kern used? Well, he

08:08.648 --> 08:13.435
just knew the people, and he would call upon the 
people he knew who weren't commies, that's all. A

08:15.178 --> 08:18.343
very simple chairmanship work. Did you know, or 
were you cognizant of a technique he used where he

08:18.643 --> 08:28.157
issued procuring people a red card and had them 
place it on his book when they raised their hand to

08:18.643 --> 08:28.157
be recognized? Seems to me that I remember that 
being done, but I'm not sure of it.

08:38.846 --> 08:40.808
This may or may not be true. I just don't remember. 
It strikes a note, but not enough to bring anything

08:43.011 --> 08:46.176
to mind. How influential was his first wife, Red, 
on him?

08:59.238 --> 09:04.466
In terms of union activities, I would say almost 
nothing. This was a personal relationship. It

09:10.516 --> 09:13.000
didn't enter into the unionism. She stayed very 
much out of it. But in terms of,

09:18.949 --> 09:25.600
they were very close. And anything that she would 
do that...

09:27.723 --> 09:38.895
She could tear him to pieces if she wanted to. She 
never wanted to do that. But she did. She got

09:44.221 --> 09:45.682
cancer. And she knew she had cancer long before 
June of it. And on two or three occasions, she just

09:52.890 --> 09:55.873
got up and left. because she couldn't face telling 
him. And he didn't know where she was, and the son

10:02.187 --> 10:07.214
didn't know where she was or anything. She did this 
twice, and this just practically wrecked Joe. But

10:13.863 --> 10:21.312
this was just a personal relationship, and she was 
thinking more of him than she was of herself. And

10:21.433 --> 10:27.801
she did the wrong thing, of course, to do it the way 
she did, because it didn't save him any pain.

10:28.827 --> 10:30.830
really made more pain for him. Would have been 
better if she'd have gone ahead and told him

10:31.451 --> 10:33.814
sooner.

10:36.518 --> 10:52.962
Do you have any interesting anecdotes in your 
career as a lobbyist for the CIO Maritime

10:36.518 --> 10:52.962
Community, or in your relationship with Joe 
Kieran, or other members of the NMU that might be of

10:36.518 --> 10:52.962
interest?

10:55.912 --> 11:00.058
or insights into his personality, his character, 
or his makeup?

11:10.992 --> 11:16.299
Well, I would say that Joel Kearns basically was 
very steadfast.

11:21.547 --> 11:24.130
If you were a friend of his, you were a friend of his.

11:32.058 --> 11:35.381
And if he believed in you, he believed in you 
wholeheartedly. Perry is a good example of this.

11:38.425 --> 11:43.770
He just trusted Perry almost completely right up 
until the end. And he would do anything for Perry.

11:53.220 --> 11:56.123
But he was like that with anyone that he trusted. I 
think he basically trusted most people until they

11:56.223 --> 12:01.609
crossed him.

12:06.770 --> 12:13.778
From your own personal opinion, what would you 
consider to be your greatest accomplishment for

12:06.770 --> 12:13.778
maritime labor? Nothing. Nothing? Literally 
nothing. I spent

12:17.843 --> 12:26.513
from 1941 to 1972 down here working for the 
merchant marine. It was in worse shape when I left

12:26.533 --> 12:29.636
than it was when I started. So I don't consider that 
any accomplishment whatsoever. Some people say

12:35.525 --> 12:39.491
that I helped keep it from being completely wiped 
out. Well, I don't consider that any

12:39.532 --> 12:41.815
accomplishment either. Maybe it would have been 
better completely wiped out than to screw along as

12:42.416 --> 12:47.484
it is now.

12:52.753 --> 12:56.840
He's the only president that ever hung up a phone on 
me.

12:58.442 --> 12:59.444
I called him one day. He was pushing an omnibus tax 
bill. And I called him up and I said, Mr. President,

13:03.706 --> 13:27.374
with all of your experience in the Senate and as 
president and as vice president, you undoubtedly

13:03.706 --> 13:27.374
know that historically

13:03.706 --> 13:27.374
no omnibus tax bill has ever gotten passed that was 
not worse than when it started out. I said, I want to

13:28.916 --> 13:33.021
suggest to you that if there is something you want 
done in taxes that you take it up one at a time and do

13:33.423 --> 13:37.767
it. He says, Hoyt, I've decided to push the omnibus 
tax bill, which I asked to get him pressed. I said,

13:46.415 --> 13:48.417
but Mr. President, you know. And he hung up on me.

13:57.045 --> 14:01.489
So I can say that he's the only president that's 
ever hung up on me.

14:10.413 --> 14:13.056
Literally, we took every program that we could. 
One of the things that the union was interested in

14:14.678 --> 14:30.378
was making the merchant seaman a part of the 
community, wherever he came from, and making him a

14:14.678 --> 14:30.378
respectable part of that community, even though 
he was away from home. So we did everything or

14:31.459 --> 14:39.930
anything that we could do that we thought would 
implement that idea. Did you have any particular

14:41.699 --> 14:45.863
ideas that you presented? I had a lot of ideas, but I 
don't remember them. Matter of fact, if I don't put

14:51.910 --> 14:59.718
them down on paper, I don't remember them five 
minutes, just like yesterday. I called the United

15:00.739 --> 15:02.521
Seaman Service. I had developed a whole group of 
things that I wanted in a manual for the board

15:11.028 --> 15:14.392
members of the United Seaman Service. And we 
brought it up at a national of my nominating

15:15.273 --> 15:25.526
committee, where we discussed them, and adopted 
them, and recommended them to the next board

15:15.273 --> 15:25.526
meeting, and got them adopted. And I didn't have a 
copy of them, so I called the office in New York for a

15:26.747 --> 15:38.201
copy of them, because the office yet had not 
implemented the resolution. I wanted to know why

15:38.301 --> 15:40.444
they hadn't, and I said, Give me the list of them so 
I'm going to put together a package of my own, and

15:40.778 --> 15:49.166
I'll give it to you. Then you have got to do the thing 
for the rest of the board members. But that's true

15:52.930 --> 15:56.774
on almost anything I work on. First of all, I do have 
a bad memory. Second of all, I do not try to remember

16:02.019 --> 16:07.124
things which I know are going to be recorded. Make 
no attempt to. But I've worked out thousands of

16:10.934 --> 16:22.933
programs for the unions and the United Seaman's 
Service, Four Freedoms, and what have you. I don't

16:24.576 --> 16:25.437
know what they are. I could go look at them, read 
through and find them, and say, yes, I had

16:25.558 --> 16:32.048
something to do with that, put that together.
