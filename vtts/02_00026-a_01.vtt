WEBVTT

00:04.402 --> 00:13.137
year 2000, in the Rudder Tower, have the honor of interviewing Dr. Ray Bowen, president of A&M, about his student years.

00:14.279 --> 00:21.010
Dr. Bowen, now a sentence, and then we'll... That is, if I can remember about my student years.

00:27.875 --> 00:35.587
To begin with, describe your background of growing up, family, high school, before.

00:36.408 --> 00:37.730
I'm the youngest of three.

00:37.750 --> 00:40.474
I have two older brothers, both of whom went to A&M.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.939
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, 1936.

00:44.961 --> 00:52.232
Went to public schools in Fort Worth until my dad moved me to Dallas when I was a senior in high school.

00:52.532 --> 00:55.637
Went a semester in North Dallas, then came to A&M from

00:55.617 --> 00:56.519
From Dallas.

00:56.679 --> 00:58.262
So you finished North Dallas High School?

00:58.602 --> 01:05.215
Technically my diploma was from Paschal High School in Fort Worth, but I actually physically was at North Dallas High School in Dallas.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.359
Still have some friends that were from there.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.466
So I came to A&M, I had North Dallas friends and Paschal friends.

01:11.665 --> 01:13.748
Now, why did you come to A&M?

01:13.808 --> 01:15.330
Why here instead of some other place?

01:15.350 --> 01:16.832
I was never asked, actually.

01:16.892 --> 01:19.115
My older brother had already graduated.

01:19.155 --> 01:27.486
He's class of 48, and my second brother was about to start his senior year, and it frankly was not a topic for negotiation.

01:28.287 --> 01:36.238
My father, a reasonably successful businessman, actually a very successful businessman, but he didn't get out of high school, and when...

01:36.472 --> 01:51.309
The story we believe around the family is that when he was playing poker one night with some friends and trying to make the decision about where my older brother would go to college, somebody told him about A&M, all male and make you study, keep you out of trouble, and so forth.

01:51.369 --> 01:55.293
And he apparently decided with that kind of frivolous advice.

01:55.834 --> 01:59.558
So when I came along eight years later, it was not... You said business.

01:59.618 --> 02:00.619
What was his profession?

02:00.699 --> 02:02.361
He was a wholesale food broker.

02:02.729 --> 02:11.288
And he had a business in Fort Worth, and he grew it into Dallas and ended up running the Dallas operation for the last many years of his life.

02:12.110 --> 02:14.195
Now, these older brothers majored in?

02:14.916 --> 02:17.522
My older brother, Herbert, majored in electrical engineering.

02:17.602 --> 02:21.531
My brother, Jerry, majored in petroleum engineering and mechanical engineering.

02:22.304 --> 02:25.251
And your older brother is the one I met with Southwestern Bell.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.174
Yes, that's right.

02:26.194 --> 02:27.617
He's retired from Southwestern Bell.

02:27.858 --> 02:33.833
So when do you remember first coming to A&M to visit?

02:34.675 --> 02:36.660
Well, I think when he was a student.

02:37.402 --> 02:38.625
He enrolled here.

02:39.955 --> 02:42.460
He's class of 48, so he enrolled in 44.

02:43.001 --> 02:46.127
He went a year, got married, went in the Navy, and came back.

02:46.147 --> 02:56.588
So it was probably 47 or 48 when I was with him and his wife, who's his current wife, at a football game.

02:57.850 --> 03:00.816
And what was it that caught your positive attention about A&M?

03:02.298 --> 03:08.588
Quite frankly, the family pressure was so great that it wasn't really an issue of what I saw as positive or negative.

03:08.768 --> 03:10.951
I think I was rather informed about what went on here.

03:11.853 --> 03:17.581
And it was my perception that it was a good engineering program, and it seemed like in my family everybody was an engineer.

03:18.403 --> 03:20.546
So engineering was your goal when you arrived?

03:20.606 --> 03:21.427
That's correct.

03:21.447 --> 03:23.410
Mechanical engineering was my goal.

03:23.430 --> 03:25.774
There wasn't a fish camp there, was there?

03:25.872 --> 03:27.655
No, there was a fish week, though.

03:27.675 --> 03:42.357
If you're in the Corps, all the freshmen came a week earlier, something like FOW week now, and that you're free of sophomores, and you had some juniors, but mostly seniors, and it was an orientation week.

03:43.318 --> 03:46.463
And describe as much as you can what went on.

03:46.814 --> 03:49.037
Well, it was mainly a military orientation.

03:49.077 --> 04:12.690
There was some university testing, placement kind of testing, so the university had some relationship there, but by my recollection, most of it was really how to get your uniform, how to put it on, how to march, and how to sort of whip out, understand what a fish is and what your privileges are so that when the sophomores came, you weren't totally destroyed.

04:13.751 --> 04:15.133
I'll never forget when I

04:15.788 --> 04:17.350
there's a privilege.

04:17.390 --> 04:20.354
You couldn't come into the end of the buildings.

04:20.574 --> 04:23.478
The freshman had to come into the front doors.

04:23.518 --> 04:25.560
You couldn't walk in the direct route at the end.

04:26.361 --> 04:41.020
An individual who turned out to be my squadron commander sort of met me at the side door, and I came in very friendly, welcomed me greatly, and then explained he'd better never catch me coming in that door again.

04:41.978 --> 04:46.284
What, as far as you can recall, what did you bring physically with you?

04:46.344 --> 04:49.568
What kind of clothing, if any, gear and so forth?

04:49.588 --> 04:51.811
Well, everything had to be in a footlocker.

04:51.831 --> 05:02.746
And, you know, books and things like that you bought here, and you didn't have a uniform, but basically what you could get in a footlocker plus what the uniform they gave you that you could then hang in your closet.

05:03.327 --> 05:05.670
And that footlocker you bought?

05:05.690 --> 05:05.931
Yes.

05:06.491 --> 05:08.274
Or was it an older brother's?

05:08.294 --> 05:09.856
Actually, mine was bought.

05:10.176 --> 05:10.737
Mine was bought.

05:11.003 --> 05:16.910
And were you assigned during that week to an outfit?

05:17.291 --> 05:17.832
That's correct.

05:17.852 --> 05:19.474
When we came here, we were in an outfit.

05:19.974 --> 05:25.902
I think we made choices of Army versus Air Force, but then past that point, you just took what you were given.

05:25.922 --> 05:26.643
And you chose?

05:26.843 --> 05:27.564
Air Force.

05:27.584 --> 05:27.844
Why?

05:28.966 --> 05:32.250
I wanted to fly an airplane, I mean, for a very superficial reason, too.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.092
And so what outfit?

05:34.713 --> 05:37.096
I started out in what was called Squadron 21.

05:37.978 --> 05:40.501
By the middle of my year, I switched to Squadron 10.

05:40.562 --> 05:44.487
I had some friends there and stayed in Squadron 10 while I went on course staff.

05:44.768 --> 05:46.110
Did it have a nickname?

05:47.071 --> 05:47.972
Not in those days.

05:48.133 --> 05:50.456
They didn't really use nicknames the way they use them now.

05:52.259 --> 05:54.021
Which dorm?

05:54.041 --> 05:58.628
Well, Squadron 21 was in 12, and then Squadron 10 was in 6.

05:59.063 --> 05:59.925
No.

05:59.945 --> 06:07.979
And the Corps was then scattered in the, quote, new dorms as well as... Yeah, all 12 of the new dorms plus the old area.

06:07.999 --> 06:11.024
There was essentially an equal number of people over there.

06:11.485 --> 06:16.414
Who were some of the personalities you met that first week that you...

06:16.934 --> 06:28.224
Well, Harry Espy was the squadron commander, and Bob Sears was the first sergeant in Squadron 21, and they're the two people that kind of jump out at me.

06:28.765 --> 06:31.147
And they're two people I've met since I've been back here.

06:31.187 --> 06:35.611
I've gone to their class reunions, and they've been there, and it's been a real treat.

06:37.753 --> 06:44.479
When did the activities begin that today a critic would call hazing?

06:44.939 --> 06:46.080
When did that begin?

06:46.280 --> 06:49.444
I think that Sunday night when we showed up.

06:49.464 --> 06:49.844
When you showed up.

06:49.985 --> 06:51.867
Yeah, but in a different tone.

06:51.927 --> 06:54.931
It was more in a way of preparation for when the sophomores came.

06:54.991 --> 07:00.557
But that Saturday, the coming Saturday, we always had a football game.

07:00.658 --> 07:07.566
And then the sophomores showed up that Friday night, and the football game was really the first, what I would call, tough experience.

07:07.586 --> 07:09.408
And this was mid-September.

07:09.468 --> 07:10.469
Yeah, mid-September.

07:10.509 --> 07:15.055
In those days, things started a little bit later in the semester, went past Christmas.

07:15.220 --> 07:17.144
So you arrived the previous?

07:17.765 --> 07:18.807
You'd drive on a Sunday.

07:19.669 --> 07:23.216
Monday through Friday, you'd have your fish week.

07:23.878 --> 07:27.024
The sophomores would begin to show up Friday night, is my recollection.

07:27.104 --> 07:28.647
And, of course, the game would be Saturday.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.571
It would be a yell practice Friday night.

07:30.611 --> 07:33.016
And things would change radically at that point.

07:33.397 --> 07:36.283
Describe that first yell practice as much as you remember.

07:36.618 --> 07:44.867
Well, it was stressful, I think, because the sophomores were releasing their emotion of having been freshmen the year before.

07:45.728 --> 07:48.190
And they didn't give you any peace and quiet.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.592
Going there was terrible.

07:49.632 --> 07:50.833
Coming back was terrible.

07:51.554 --> 07:56.238
And the freshmen eventually learned to stick together and learn how to, in effect, haze the upperclassmen.

07:56.279 --> 07:58.361
But at that point, you don't know this.

07:58.881 --> 08:00.583
You see yourself as pretty much alone.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.625
Yale practice was held that year where?

08:02.686 --> 08:03.186
In the Grove.

08:03.587 --> 08:04.107
In the Grove.

08:04.888 --> 08:10.034
And the people who attended were students plus whom else?

08:10.054 --> 08:12.217
It was primarily students.

08:12.257 --> 08:14.019
That's really all I'm conscious of.

08:14.179 --> 08:16.121
So no girlfriends to speak of?

08:16.141 --> 08:17.643
Well, the upperclassmen did.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.485
They were more sophisticated about that.

08:19.505 --> 08:23.030
They had some plans, but the freshmen didn't.

08:23.050 --> 08:26.434
And then the next day, then a game.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.237
Do you remember anything about that game?

08:29.993 --> 08:33.337
No, of course, you stand up, and we knew we had to do that.

08:33.457 --> 08:34.839
I don't even know who we played.

08:34.879 --> 08:40.686
It was, I believe, the first game that Bear Bryant played as coach.

08:41.888 --> 08:44.471
We played with Bryant as our coach.

08:44.491 --> 08:49.698
And everybody was excited about the new coach and all of that kind of stuff.

08:49.718 --> 08:56.406
But if you recall that year, it was a terrible year because he couldn't play as freshmen, and all his great athletes were freshmen.

08:56.386 --> 09:01.978
Then you had registered during that week.

09:02.198 --> 09:03.621
Yes, we had registered during that week.

09:03.982 --> 09:05.144
Remember how many hours you took?

09:05.745 --> 09:07.389
Eighteen, I think, something like that.

09:08.331 --> 09:16.167
And as you arrived, what did you and your parents assume would be the number of years you would spend on your undergraduate degree?

09:16.349 --> 09:17.010
Only four.

09:17.070 --> 09:19.472
I mean, you just wouldn't contemplate anything different.

09:19.533 --> 09:20.934
And the peer pressure was great.

09:21.174 --> 09:28.142
You would contemplate flunking a class so you might have to stay longer, which is just the worst possible thing to happen.

09:28.222 --> 09:38.213
And occasionally you'd meet people in five-year programs, like petroleum geological engineering was a five-year program, and architecture is a five-year program.

09:38.273 --> 09:42.418
And you just couldn't imagine how strange that appeared to people.

09:42.438 --> 09:44.280
You mean you'll stay in college an extra year?

09:45.053 --> 09:48.718
Your major was mechanical?

09:48.758 --> 09:49.198
Mechanical.

09:49.218 --> 09:50.100
From day one?

09:50.120 --> 09:52.783
From day one.

09:53.124 --> 09:56.628
How did you select courses for that first semester?

09:57.149 --> 09:58.010
Oh, they just told me.

09:59.832 --> 10:04.278
In the catalog, you can look at it now, and you'll see essentially every course is prescribed.

10:05.119 --> 10:07.803
The only question was what time of day you take the class.

10:08.363 --> 10:13.290
I think there were electives in junior, maybe senior year, one elective or something.

10:13.871 --> 10:14.892
It was very prescribed.

10:15.277 --> 10:20.926
Did you all go through the SEBISA registration system?

10:21.366 --> 10:22.388
Yes, yes.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.510
Stand in line.

10:23.530 --> 10:32.383
Of course, I think that at Fish Week, it was expedited in some way, but the typical routine was stand in line and take your best shot.

10:33.285 --> 10:36.610
What are some memories of that first semester academically?

10:38.615 --> 10:41.478
I was not what was perceived to be a good student.

10:41.939 --> 10:49.327
In fact, my older brothers, they kind of smile when I speculate about this now, but I think they were making bets that I wouldn't make it.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.550
And I really had to learn to study.

10:51.590 --> 10:52.471
I didn't know how to study.

10:53.392 --> 10:58.478
And in those days, there were mid-semester grades, and I did terrible, just absolutely terrible.

10:59.018 --> 11:02.142
My biggest recollection was that nobody cared.

11:02.122 --> 11:03.884
It was my problem.

11:03.924 --> 11:04.846
It wasn't their problem.

11:04.866 --> 11:06.107
The upperclassmen didn't care.

11:06.247 --> 11:07.789
If you flunk out, that's your problem.

11:08.510 --> 11:12.696
It just sort of dawned on me that if I was going to stay here, I had to do it on my own.

11:13.317 --> 11:15.660
And I sort of grew up, and I think boys do that.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.385
I think boys sort of wake up one day, and they're different than they were the day before.

11:20.186 --> 11:22.889
And that hit me in the middle of my freshman first semester.

11:22.909 --> 11:25.092
Was there any person that helped to reassure you?

11:26.152 --> 11:26.733
Not really.

11:26.813 --> 11:39.368
My brother, Jerry, was always good, but he was a senior, very preoccupied, and he wasn't sort of, he didn't ridicule my efforts, and he was always supportive, but he wasn't sort of a mentor or anything like that.

11:40.149 --> 11:41.510
So you decided on your own?

11:41.570 --> 11:42.772
Yeah, that's my recollection.

11:42.832 --> 11:48.699
The reality may be different, but my recollection and my bad stage is this is my problem.

11:48.719 --> 11:50.421
So at the end of the first semester,

11:50.823 --> 11:52.546
In the first semester, I did reasonably well.

11:52.647 --> 11:53.388
You passed everything.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.270
I passed everything.

11:54.350 --> 12:00.422
I think I had an upper C average or something, which I was perfectly satisfied with.

12:00.943 --> 12:03.788
And it progressively got better the longer I stayed.

12:03.808 --> 12:05.672
You're a fish old lady.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.496
Did you all use that terminology?

12:07.576 --> 12:07.836
Yes.

12:08.317 --> 12:09.760
Who was that?

12:11.258 --> 12:13.044
Tell the truth, I think his name was Bishop.

12:13.084 --> 12:16.496
He flunked out that first semester and I never saw him again.

12:16.557 --> 12:19.647
I've been curious about finding him and going back to him.

12:20.591 --> 12:23.260
I mentioned we changed outfits.

12:24.472 --> 12:25.714
I changed with a friend.

12:25.834 --> 12:32.144
I'd grown close to a guy I'd gone to high school with in Dallas named Joe Giffray, and he was in a different outfit.

12:32.184 --> 12:35.429
So the two of us moved to Squadron 10 as roommates.

12:36.070 --> 12:36.952
At the end of the first semester.

12:36.972 --> 12:38.053
End of the first semester.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.318
So he was really the fish old lady that I remember the most.

12:41.819 --> 12:43.241
And I had a bad batting average.

12:43.282 --> 12:45.785
He sort of flunked out of school fairly quick, too.

12:46.447 --> 12:48.049
But he eventually came back and graduated.

12:48.198 --> 12:52.366
Describe the furnishings of a freshman's room at that time.

12:52.466 --> 12:53.368
What was in the room?

12:53.408 --> 12:54.350
They were not elegant.

12:55.071 --> 12:56.434
You've perhaps seen these things.

12:56.494 --> 13:09.278
There was a bunk bed, metal with just a wire kind of spring with kind of a dirty, thin mattress on it, which, of course, you had to make up in a military style.

13:09.258 --> 13:21.813
There was a desk for each of you, and there was a shelf for your books, and there was a closet on either side of the door as you came in to hang your clothes, and there was a basin where you could brush your teeth and get water and so forth.

13:22.173 --> 13:22.954
And that was really it.

13:23.555 --> 13:26.358
There was probably one or two plugs in the room.

13:26.959 --> 13:30.243
I think if you were a sophomore, you could have a radio or something.

13:30.303 --> 13:33.426
We used to relish the time we could have a radio.

13:34.127 --> 13:38.252
No phones, TVs, computers, stereos.

13:38.232 --> 13:39.474
No air conditioning, of course.

13:39.934 --> 13:42.858
Describe a typical class day.

13:42.959 --> 13:45.983
What time did you get up and what did you do at what hour?

13:46.123 --> 13:50.309
Well, as a freshman, you had to get up about 6.30 in the morning to have breakfast early.

13:50.349 --> 13:52.192
You were not allowed to miss that.

13:53.513 --> 13:56.838
But you had to go to bed about 10.30 or so without special permission.

13:56.898 --> 13:58.941
So your day was regimented quite a bit.

13:58.921 --> 14:04.110
But the academic side of it, it was quite common six days a week to have an 8 o'clock class.

14:04.551 --> 14:07.156
You might luck out and have a 9 o'clock a couple days.

14:08.018 --> 14:16.513
And you'd probably go to class certainly all morning, and maybe one or two days a week you wouldn't have classes late in the afternoon.

14:16.533 --> 14:22.043
But as you got older with labs and so forth, it wasn't unusual to have classes essentially all afternoon as well.

14:22.647 --> 14:28.515
And did you have an upperclassman's room you were responsible for caring for?

14:28.896 --> 14:31.379
I came in the liberal time.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.841
Actually, I did not.

14:34.844 --> 14:37.688
Class of 58 just didn't have to do that.

14:38.369 --> 14:44.638
You know, I had little sort of harmless personal service, go to the laundry for me, do things like that.

14:44.738 --> 14:49.144
But there was no sort of responsibility to clean up somebody else's room.

14:50.018 --> 14:54.163
What about hazing after supper in the dormitory?

14:54.183 --> 14:55.184
It occasionally occurred.

14:56.566 --> 15:08.981
My freshman year, my second semester of my freshman year, in celebration of something, I think an intramural championship or something, some of the upperclassmen got prunes out and took them out after the freshman.

15:10.983 --> 15:18.372
Somebody turned them in like they always do, it seems like, and there was a big controversy surrounding my outfit associated with that hazing.

15:18.807 --> 15:26.919
We always saw it as unimportant and trivial, and we thought the university was quite unreasonable to worry about such things.

15:27.461 --> 15:29.188
And paddles had pretty well vanished?

15:29.506 --> 15:31.929
Occasionally, but not as a common thing.

15:31.969 --> 15:35.755
You'd find someone that had a paddle in their room, but I was never hit with a paddle.

15:36.516 --> 15:48.072
My experience was being on the bad end of a broom, and they'd hit you with the large end, not the stick.

15:48.092 --> 15:49.995
And how many licks, maybe?

15:50.043 --> 15:51.245
Not many, one or two.

15:51.786 --> 15:53.688
Sometimes you trade licks.

15:54.670 --> 16:04.324
And if you did something wrong and you got hit with a broom, theoretically it's possible for them to mess up, hit you low or high, and then you got to hit them.

16:04.384 --> 16:05.646
And that was always a lot of fun.

16:06.567 --> 16:10.813
But looking back on it, we never saw it as physical abuse.

16:11.675 --> 16:13.477
It was a different time and a different context.

16:14.118 --> 16:16.101
Occasionally we would trade licks.

16:16.081 --> 16:21.073
and take great pride in how we could basically launch our buddies in some way.

16:22.196 --> 16:31.879
In this second outfit you were in, that we'd be with for a while, were there some key leaders in that outfit?

16:32.180 --> 16:37.006
Yeah, one of the Yale leaders that year was the squadron commander.

16:37.026 --> 16:39.689
His name was Carpenter, Bob Carpenter, wonderful guy.

16:40.290 --> 16:51.945
First sergeant was a guy named Alan Greer, but his leadership came in conflict with this hazing thing, and I think he never became a squadron commander, or he was in a short period of time.

16:52.826 --> 16:59.975
A number of people I see now, one of the meanest sophomores I've ever encountered in my life was a guy named George Alexander.

17:00.215 --> 17:01.697
He lives in San Angelo now.

17:01.677 --> 17:04.397
George was a

17:05.423 --> 17:06.865
Really tough, very demanding.

17:07.826 --> 17:14.874
And one of the first people that called me after I got this job was this wonderful, kind, friendly person named George Alexander.

17:15.455 --> 17:17.257
And I'm not sure it's the same guy.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.079
Obviously it is.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.743
But he's become a great friend over the years.

17:22.863 --> 17:23.945
And there are just a lot of people.

17:24.005 --> 17:30.192
Dewey McMullen is a retired faculty member here in construction science.

17:30.232 --> 17:32.815
He was a sophomore in that first outfit.

17:32.795 --> 17:35.979
that I've made friends with as I've come back here.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.882
And he was always a kind guy.

17:39.564 --> 17:45.613
LaVon Anderson is a former student that's active in the Chancellor's Century Council, was in that second outfit.

17:46.474 --> 17:53.364
Huge number of people that largely in the second outfit I've gotten to know again as I've come back.

17:53.384 --> 17:53.604
All right.

17:53.865 --> 18:02.076
And one of your classmates, I believe, who has been very generous to the institution, when did you first meet him?

18:02.478 --> 18:03.700
Well, you're talking about John Hagler.

18:04.802 --> 18:11.975
John and I were selected to be on Corps staff at the same time, at the end of our sophomore year is when that selection was made.

18:12.656 --> 18:16.703
And he ended up as my roommate, and we were roommates together for two years.

18:18.727 --> 18:20.149
Did you know each other before that?

18:20.169 --> 18:21.071
Not really, not really.

18:21.131 --> 18:25.819
He was in the Army side of things, and he was in a field artillery.

18:25.799 --> 18:29.224
And maybe his sophomore year, he was even in the other area.

18:29.705 --> 18:30.806
I don't really remember that.

18:32.108 --> 18:32.789
Probably so.

18:33.310 --> 18:36.395
And I had not known him, but we became good friends.

18:36.435 --> 18:38.298
He was an ag econ major.

18:38.878 --> 18:41.202
So our paths just had not crossed.

18:41.222 --> 18:46.109
He was a good student, and I was an evolving good student.

18:46.129 --> 18:53.460
During that first year, describe what the routine was for fish in the chow hall.

18:54.942 --> 18:56.646
Of course, you always had to sit at attention.

18:57.127 --> 19:04.703
And your job was to serve, sort of be the transport system for food around the table and serve everybody else.

19:05.385 --> 19:15.246
And there was an entire language for the, every kind of food had its own unique name and you had your own language to use.

19:15.226 --> 19:22.056
It was a difficult period, you know, tightly structured.

19:22.096 --> 19:24.079
If you messed up, you're in great trouble.

19:24.880 --> 19:30.508
And the great benefit was when you had time to wait until all the upperclassmen had left and then you could get something to eat.

19:31.349 --> 19:33.031
Did you all use all the slang?

19:33.532 --> 19:34.233
Yes, yes.

19:34.293 --> 19:36.937
Every item of food had its own name.

19:37.698 --> 19:43.326
Did you ever get into trouble at home when you forgot and used some...

19:43.897 --> 19:44.638
Bad name?

19:45.199 --> 19:47.001
No, actually I didn't.

19:47.021 --> 19:49.684
My mother was pretty tolerant of her sons.

19:49.804 --> 19:52.348
Because I've heard of some Aggies who did.

19:52.368 --> 19:53.609
I can imagine.

19:53.709 --> 19:56.573
I can imagine some misunderstandings would come up.

19:56.833 --> 19:57.855
All right.

19:58.916 --> 20:00.118
Did you ever get in?

20:00.818 --> 20:06.526
Can you share any assignments that somebody gave you as a fish at the chow hall?

20:07.447 --> 20:08.368
Some tasks?

20:08.956 --> 20:21.599
Well, there were always situations where a senior with a sense of humor would send you to another table to insult some other senior friend, knowing full well that when you did it, you would be abused terribly, verbally abused terribly.

20:22.381 --> 20:27.049
There was always a lot of what they call good bull in that context.

20:27.434 --> 20:35.305
One of the things that happened after you were around a while, you became sort of insulated against the kind of negatives of that.

20:35.365 --> 20:36.868
It became a lot of fun.

20:37.469 --> 20:48.745
You almost like the idea of playing the naive young freshman to go over and do something outrageous to some big-shot upperclassman and then act like you're a victim of that.

20:48.805 --> 20:49.846
You didn't understand.

20:50.708 --> 20:54.353
So you get caught up in it, and in effect, you haze the upperclassman.

20:54.991 --> 21:01.900
Can you share with this machine some of the ludicrous task assignments you were given?

21:02.060 --> 21:02.961
Not really.

21:04.524 --> 21:05.485
That was too far ago.

21:05.745 --> 21:08.689
I just can't do it.

21:09.130 --> 21:14.617
Ever have assignments to go to Northgate to get something or Southgate?

21:14.677 --> 21:15.438
Yeah, occasionally.

21:15.478 --> 21:17.100
Not in an excessive way.

21:17.468 --> 21:22.114
Go pick up someone's laundry, for example, is a more common kind of thing.

21:22.614 --> 21:29.623
Occasionally you'd be asked to go buy something for someone at Northgate, but not really in a real interfering way.

21:30.183 --> 21:35.409
Did anyone ever ask you to do something that was really far beyond good reason?

21:36.711 --> 21:42.598
Probably so, but not probably I thought at the time, but nothing that has been retained over the years.

21:43.000 --> 21:52.601
You'd occasionally have an upper class one that was extremely busy and asked you to do something that was clearly out of the rules or out of the protocols.

21:53.062 --> 21:56.390
Typically one of his classmates would say, no, don't do that.

21:57.833 --> 22:00.098
There was a kind of a self-correcting process there.

22:00.905 --> 22:05.111
And in your era, all the veterans are pretty well gone.

22:05.571 --> 22:07.434
The Korean veterans had come back.

22:07.474 --> 22:10.158
My freshman year was full of Korean veterans.

22:11.139 --> 22:13.082
That period of time at A&M was interesting.

22:13.122 --> 22:15.946
The Corps was not required in my freshman year.

22:16.526 --> 22:17.267
That's correct.

22:17.287 --> 22:21.513
In fact, it was not required the four years I was an undergraduate.

22:21.553 --> 22:24.297
There was a tremendous peer pressure to be in the Corps.

22:24.277 --> 22:31.612
The enrollment was robust, but if you got out of the Corps, you didn't have to leave the university like you did in the old days.

22:32.273 --> 22:36.482
But simultaneously, there were a lot of Korean veterans that came back to school.

22:36.522 --> 22:43.416
So the typical class had cadets, of course, but it had a healthy dose of veterans and some non-reg students.

22:43.970 --> 22:49.625
What effect did those real veterans have on the campus?

22:49.926 --> 22:53.756
Well, not too much in terms of the Corps life.

22:53.796 --> 22:54.858
You didn't see them.

22:54.878 --> 22:57.345
Many of them were married and so forth.

22:57.365 --> 23:00.072
But in the classroom, they had a dramatic effect.

23:00.052 --> 23:16.052
They were just not the horsing around, you know, and the kinds of questions they were asked were very serious, very intense, and if we acted in a kind of frivolous, unconcerned way, they would either scowl at us and more than once tell us how stupid we were.

23:16.032 --> 23:19.837
And they were a stabilizing influence, let's put it that way.

23:19.857 --> 23:20.939
That's what I was assuming.

23:21.740 --> 23:25.124
And College View was full.

23:25.405 --> 23:26.326
College View was there.

23:26.386 --> 23:26.947
It was full.

23:27.007 --> 23:28.288
In fact, it had been there for years.

23:28.369 --> 23:31.893
My older brother and his wife had lived in it when he came back from the Navy.

23:32.895 --> 23:39.784
And the project houses were still... I don't remember much about the project houses.

23:40.224 --> 23:42.387
I've learned more about them since I've been here.

23:42.668 --> 23:45.111
I think if they were there, I just didn't pay attention to them.

23:46.238 --> 23:53.211
The first Silver Taps, do you remember?

23:55.300 --> 23:56.881
Barely, barely.

23:57.322 --> 23:59.804
It was an unusual experience.

24:00.284 --> 24:03.087
My recollection was I didn't really know what to expect.

24:03.347 --> 24:10.614
I knew that if we said a word, going, coming, we turned the light on, it was like death.

24:10.734 --> 24:11.955
You'd be kicked out of school.

24:13.857 --> 24:17.360
I couldn't imagine how intense the pressure was not to say anything.

24:18.121 --> 24:20.343
You're preconditioned, of course, to speak to everybody.

24:20.703 --> 24:25.307
All of a sudden, people you were seeing and you knew that knew you, you couldn't speak.

24:25.287 --> 24:31.484
It was an unusual event, but I don't remember the specifics about it.

24:31.625 --> 24:38.003
During your student years, was it always taken seriously by all the students?

24:38.564 --> 24:39.928
Absolutely.

24:40.028 --> 24:40.630
No exception.

24:41.015 --> 24:43.198
I would have been dumbfounded if there had been a different answer.

24:43.218 --> 24:44.880
It was strong, really strong.

24:46.002 --> 24:53.032
In fact, now Silver Taps is still an important event, but there are parts of the campus that there are lights on.

24:54.053 --> 24:54.874
You'd never see that.

24:55.075 --> 24:57.197
You'd never see a light in a remote building.

24:57.238 --> 24:59.040
The campus would be absolutely black.

24:59.020 --> 25:06.093
You know, there are timers on the house that Sally and I live in that the light on the garage would be on.

25:06.173 --> 25:08.798
Well, that would never happen in the old days.

25:08.818 --> 25:11.363
You would have been expected to shut it down completely.

25:11.423 --> 25:14.108
And you came back to your room.

25:14.268 --> 25:16.031
You didn't turn the light on and start studying.

25:16.051 --> 25:17.113
You went to bed.

25:18.356 --> 25:20.099
Did you go on court trips that first year?

25:20.460 --> 25:21.141
Yeah.

25:21.161 --> 25:21.822
Describe...

25:22.561 --> 25:27.236
Well, I wish I could remember precisely where we went.

25:27.337 --> 25:30.647
We went to Fort Worth or Dallas and Austin or Houston.

25:31.249 --> 25:35.102
I don't remember, frankly, which of those places we went to.

25:36.736 --> 25:41.323
Being from Dallas, I probably took advantage of that since my parents were there.

25:41.383 --> 25:42.846
It was a great experience.

25:42.866 --> 25:44.629
You typically bummed off a friend.

25:44.709 --> 25:48.976
In my experience, you never stayed in a hotel or slept in your car.

25:49.036 --> 25:51.820
You found a fish buddy or somebody to stay with.

25:52.521 --> 25:53.723
You typically had a date.

25:54.144 --> 25:55.626
Did you have wheels that freshman year?

25:57.429 --> 25:58.231
Part of the year I did.

25:58.551 --> 25:59.813
Part of the year I did.

25:59.893 --> 26:03.038
I'll tell you back my freshman year I did not.

26:03.098 --> 26:04.060
My sophomore year I did.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.766
So how did you get on the court?

26:06.786 --> 26:07.347
Hitchhiked.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.631
Like everybody else, you hitchhiked.

26:09.651 --> 26:12.916
And it's kind of unfortunate that that's been lost over the years.

26:12.976 --> 26:16.541
Our society now just wouldn't support something like that.

26:17.222 --> 26:20.988
Yeah, I would hitchhike to Dallas on more than court trips.

26:21.028 --> 26:25.475
If I just decided I had to go to Dallas, I'd go out, get on the highway, and hitchhike.

26:25.495 --> 26:28.039
And where was the best place to catch the ride?

26:28.255 --> 26:34.408
Well, basically somewhere around Northgate or over on Texas Avenue in front of now the Williamsville.

26:35.170 --> 26:37.595
Did you ever have a negative experience?

26:37.615 --> 26:38.036
Not one.

26:38.337 --> 26:38.757
Not one.

26:38.798 --> 26:39.479
It was amazing.

26:39.659 --> 26:43.648
Looking back on it, you would think you'd had something strange happen, but never one.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.572
Any amusing experiences?

26:46.632 --> 26:47.893
No, everybody was very nice.

26:48.374 --> 26:54.661
I discovered some good restaurants between here and Dallas, some greasy spoons.

26:55.622 --> 27:00.067
Everybody would typically want to stop and buy you something to eat or something, but no native experience.

27:00.087 --> 27:03.010
Nobody ever offered you whiskey?

27:03.350 --> 27:03.570
No.

27:04.091 --> 27:04.592
Actually, no.

27:04.712 --> 27:08.216
I led a dull life.

27:09.116 --> 27:13.281
During that first year, how did you communicate with family?

27:14.510 --> 27:15.351
Letters.

27:15.752 --> 27:16.373
You'd write them.

27:16.393 --> 27:17.955
There was like one phone.

27:18.676 --> 27:20.319
There may have been one phone in the dorm.

27:20.399 --> 27:25.286
If there wasn't, there was one in the dorm adjacent to it, a pay phone, but you never called.

27:25.306 --> 27:29.012
And there weren't any emergencies, I hope, that occurred.

27:29.032 --> 27:29.572
No, never.

27:31.255 --> 27:34.860
And in terms of class attendance, how often did you go to class?

27:35.441 --> 27:37.164
Well, in those days, you really went to class.

27:37.224 --> 27:42.512
Everybody checked roll, and there was little tolerance of missing class.

27:42.532 --> 27:43.453
In fact, if you missed

27:44.716 --> 27:46.178
I had unexcused absences.

27:46.218 --> 27:49.062
They just docu-grade somehow.

27:49.082 --> 27:54.891
And the engineering, math, science kinds of things I was taking, there was no flexibility at all.

27:56.193 --> 28:02.202
Who were some of those key instructors as you look back in the first year or two?

28:03.042 --> 28:07.692
The first year or two, they really didn't take on much of an identity.

28:07.913 --> 28:11.641
I had a math class from Professor Porter, I remember.

28:11.822 --> 28:15.911
It was actually what we call analytic geometry.

28:15.931 --> 28:19.098
And I learned later, I think he'd been the department head some years before.

28:19.138 --> 28:22.806
He was a fine gentleman and a great teacher.

28:22.786 --> 28:28.292
The faculty I remember and think back of were the ones that taught the major classes later.

28:28.352 --> 28:32.596
There was someone you know, Cliff Semang, a giant of a man.

28:33.177 --> 28:36.581
He was the, called him Big Steam.

28:36.661 --> 28:38.603
He taught the thermal classes and stuff.

28:38.863 --> 28:41.045
He passed away right after I came back here.

28:41.186 --> 28:43.968
It had been years since I'd seen him.

28:44.469 --> 28:45.830
Some of my professors are still around.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.292
Ed Holdridge was my

28:47.272 --> 28:56.981
One of my undergraduate teachers and my major professor left A&M right before I got my PhD and Ed took over my committee and signed my dissertation.

28:59.924 --> 29:07.772
In those undergraduate days, what were some of Professor Semang's good traits?

29:09.733 --> 29:14.578
I think rigidity was one of his biggest traits.

29:14.558 --> 29:16.441
His classes were very structured.

29:16.521 --> 29:19.465
It was sort of like, you could tell he had a military background.

29:20.086 --> 29:21.848
Everybody had an assigned seat.

29:22.429 --> 29:24.532
You had to homework every time.

29:25.053 --> 29:28.638
Three or four problems you had to work to turn into the next class.

29:29.600 --> 29:34.086
And you had to turn them in in a certain sequence so that when he sat down that night to grade them,

29:34.066 --> 29:37.591
yours had better be alphabetically in the right place.

29:37.751 --> 29:39.213
If it wasn't, he'd count off.

29:40.114 --> 29:43.199
And everything in the class was so carefully done.

29:43.239 --> 29:45.101
His lectures were precise.

29:46.443 --> 29:51.730
There was never a question, no imprecision at all about the way he presented the material.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.374
You tell he'd done it a few times.

29:54.394 --> 30:03.887
A few years later, I heard myths from students about some of the math courses by Square Root Jackson and Cube Root Kent were those

30:04.070 --> 30:05.833
I never had them as teachers.

30:06.093 --> 30:06.794
I've heard about them.

30:08.376 --> 30:11.721
What were the tough courses that a mechanical engineer had to get through?

30:12.302 --> 30:18.371
Well, one of the courses that was kind of the separator was a course called statics.

30:18.431 --> 30:22.718
You took it your sophomore year, and a lot of people failed it.

30:22.798 --> 30:25.181
It was kind of the dividing class.

30:26.103 --> 30:33.233
Of course, chemistry and physics were your freshman year, but if you got into the first engineering class, the statics was the one that you really confronted.

30:33.652 --> 30:38.524
And if you got through it and the follow-on course, Dynamics, and you got through Thermo, you could probably make it.

30:39.206 --> 30:41.652
Engineering was kind of downhill from that point.

30:41.672 --> 30:43.456
And that would be third year.

30:43.657 --> 30:46.564
Yeah, Dynamics was third year, and Thermo was third year.

30:47.168 --> 30:59.442
As you recall your freshman class, about how many, maybe your outfit's the better measuring stick, about how many were back the second year?

30:59.983 --> 31:00.683
About half.

31:00.704 --> 31:02.626
About half?

31:02.646 --> 31:03.026
Yeah.

31:03.046 --> 31:09.093
As you were... And a lot of those left the first couple weeks.

31:09.113 --> 31:13.378
About how many of them left would have...
