00:01.921 --> 00:05.706
Okay, now the basic issue is... The basic issue is this.

00:07.969 --> 00:20.727
I think we all agree that we should try to extend life as long as it is enjoyable and pleasant.

00:20.747 --> 00:30.460
But there will come a point, even though we may extend it considerably farther, remember that that biological time clock is set

00:31.300 --> 00:38.007
and we aren't going to move it very much beyond that, what we consider now the maximum longevity.

00:40.770 --> 00:58.629
And the machine wears out the human body, whether it's a heart, and we've seen all that's been done with heart bypasses and with artificial hearts, but there are many other things that start wearing out at the same time.

00:58.649 --> 00:59.890
And do we want to

01:01.253 --> 01:04.997
perpetuate life, let's assume that we could cut out cancer.

01:05.017 --> 01:09.181
Let's assume that all kinds of cancer, just for assumption.

01:10.322 --> 01:17.890
That suddenly we could expect a life and longevity of 95 years.

01:21.273 --> 01:26.839
What would be the increased incidence of Alzheimer's and mental breakdowns?

01:27.764 --> 01:29.526
I don't want to go that way.

01:30.047 --> 01:33.251
There has to be some common sense in these whole issues.

01:34.153 --> 01:42.684
And people get emotionally involved as they reach a certain stage of life, and especially when they are bored.

01:42.844 --> 01:48.552
They've got all of the luxuries of a good life, money and influence.

01:49.894 --> 01:56.623
And they have to climb on that white steed with the spear in hand and

01:57.481 --> 02:02.671
Here we go again, charging the windmills, Don Quixote style.

02:02.751 --> 02:08.783
And we look for the fountain of perpetual youth.

02:09.004 --> 02:11.188
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could find it?

02:11.268 --> 02:19.725
But just think of the disaster it would provoke with population growth until we learn to balance all of these things.

02:21.781 --> 02:51.703
agree with many things but on the other on another sense you're somewhat off the topic on the types of charges that they've been leveling against you but we're going to talk about that next time because you have to go and I have to go yesterday yesterday I was in Washington the senator or congressman Smith Neal Smith from Iowa had gotten together

02:53.168 --> 03:07.229
with the interest of both the urban, quite a few urban senators, or from metropolitan areas, as well as rural, on what to do about agriculture.

03:07.429 --> 03:10.634
What's the mess, all of the farmers going broke.

03:11.415 --> 03:13.799
And so I guess I was... I want to get your opinion on this next time too.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.061
Yeah, but I'll just mention this.

03:15.181 --> 03:17.324
I was the only biologist.

03:18.866 --> 03:22.011
The other, there were probably 15

03:23.864 --> 03:25.246
outstanding economist.

03:26.648 --> 03:27.369
No historians?

03:28.551 --> 03:31.255
No.

03:32.657 --> 03:43.913
I was the only biologist in the whole thing and towards the closing part, Stolt, the old Des Moines Register person was there.

03:46.096 --> 03:48.179
He's retired now.

03:48.199 --> 03:51.103
He was one of their old nine good writers.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.975
talking about the surpluses.

03:54.737 --> 04:06.434
And he said, I think that maybe the thing that we need to do is to ration chemicals.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.458
And he went on and on for three or four minutes.

04:08.518 --> 04:09.379
There wasn't much time.

04:11.162 --> 04:15.849
And I said, I want to object and object strenuously.

04:17.451 --> 04:19.875
I said, if you want to

04:21.965 --> 04:51.364
cut your production don't do it on a camouflage by rationing fertilizer because I saw the consequences of this on what happened in DDT and I repeated the bloody gore of what happened and I said it wasn't as soon as that was banned here certain organizations were pressuring other governments and the consequences was exactly what happened in India

04:51.715 --> 05:06.853
And I said, and if this were to happen in the U.S., which is supposed to be a political leading country in food production, you set up, give the wrong signals to the world.

05:07.914 --> 05:16.824
That you are implying that these chemicals are polluting the water and creating all of these problems, and that's why you're rationing.

05:17.465 --> 05:20.068
And I said, I can't think of anything worse.

05:20.251 --> 05:23.761
recognizing what happened in DDT.

05:24.442 --> 05:27.350
And he said, well, I didn't mean it quite in that way.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.175
I said, I don't care how you mean it.

05:29.316 --> 05:30.459
That's what you're playing with.

05:31.361 --> 05:33.788
We can go into detail later.
