WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:10.439
Okay, my name is Colson Tuff, and you'd ask me how I 
got connected with the company and how I got to

00:01.550 --> 00:10.439
Houston. Right. I was with the University of 
California at Irvine when the University of

00:10.780 --> 00:25.535
Houston was on the threshold of a large enrollment 
gain because they went from a private institution

00:10.780 --> 00:25.535
to be public in the early 60s. And they just 
started, and they were having problems with the

00:26.716 --> 00:31.101
billing program, so they trying to find someone to 
head up that program, found me, and made me a good

00:31.705 --> 00:36.050
offer. And I moved and came there. Had you had a 
Houston connection? No, no, no. I hardly knew

00:41.255 --> 00:42.777
where Houston was. Is that right? But they knew you 
were doing the same thing there. Yeah, I had been

00:46.902 --> 00:53.308
with the University of California for 12 years and 
had gone through a lot of the same kind of thing. And

00:53.429 --> 00:57.493
of course, at that time, the University of 
California you know, still underway in a huge

00:58.655 --> 01:03.200
program, and I've been involved in that right from 
the beginning. So I went to the University of

01:03.280 --> 01:06.843
Houston and... So you got there in Houston 
about... 68. 68. Mm-hmm. And we had a lot of work

01:12.028 --> 01:18.775
going on on the main campus, and it was a 
single-campus institution at that time. And then

01:18.875 --> 01:27.784
around 69, the coordinating board had done some 
studies of population growth in Texas and areas

01:18.875 --> 01:27.784
and then recommended at the University of Houston 
established two branch campuses, one to the north

01:28.270 --> 01:35.098
and one to the south of the city of Houston. And I had 
the responsibility of trying to locate where

01:36.680 --> 01:41.806
these campuses would be. We also had to get the land 
free, and we had to have it serviced by Rosie

01:41.846 --> 01:52.438
Utilities at no cost to the state, which was quite 
an undertaking to try to get it.

01:53.954 --> 02:03.625
So anyway, we had a small graduate center down in 
the Clear Lake area, near Clear Lake City, near

01:53.954 --> 02:03.625
NASA, had 50 acres. And so I began negotiations 
with the Friendswood Company towards acquiring

02:03.785 --> 02:07.990
the land. That was successful. I think we received 
around 340 acres or something like that, and then

02:10.653 --> 02:19.303
began the planning for the Clear Lake campus as it 
exists now. That's a nice campus. It is. It turned

02:20.942 --> 02:21.944
out real nice. Alfred Newman was the chancellor. 
And Alfred was dean of arts and sciences at the main

02:23.826 --> 02:28.453
campus at that time. And I knew him there. And I had 
the concept of trying to create a gallery of

02:30.897 --> 02:38.529
education, of having it all in one building. 
Because coming from California and seeing those

02:38.549 --> 02:47.502
kids walking from class to class through the heat 
and the rain, that was quite a different

02:38.549 --> 02:47.502
experience for me. And so I thought, try to have all 
the academic facilities in one large

02:48.157 --> 02:59.210
galleria-type building, rather than having all 
these little separate buildings. And so that's

02:59.231 --> 03:02.094
how we did the first phase of development. Well, at 
about the same time, we had to find land to the

03:02.114 --> 03:05.879
north. I had heard about Kingwood beginning to 
start, which was the development of Friendswood

03:07.921 --> 03:15.210
and the King Ranch. And then someone told me about 
George Mitchell planning to start a new

03:15.730 --> 03:26.764
development, which was not at that time called the 
Woodlands, but it was going to be a new development

03:15.730 --> 03:26.764
north of the city. So I had made appointments with 
the people at Kingwood for Dr. Hoffman, who was

03:27.906 --> 03:37.298
president of the University of Houston at the 
time, and myself to go meet with them. And we toured

03:38.219 --> 03:39.882
that area. And then we made an appointment to meet 
with Mr. Mitchell. to tour what was going to be the

03:43.237 --> 03:45.660
woodlands. At that time, Interstate 45 was here. 
You could just come over the bridge, and it just

03:48.403 --> 03:53.368
stopped at this end, this forest from there. So we 
had that meeting. We had a tour with Mr. Mitchell,

03:55.671 --> 04:04.560
and that must have been about around

03:55.671 --> 04:04.560
maybe 1970. At that point, did Mitchell describe 
if you remember anything about what his plans

04:11.131 --> 04:13.453
were. Oh, yes. We had the meeting up here. And then 
we were impressed with what we saw. And we invited

04:20.820 --> 04:24.164
Mr. Mitchell to come and make a presentation to the 
Board of Regents. And he did. And he came with a

04:24.844 --> 04:28.008
member of his staff. And Mr. Mitchell made an 
excellent presentation, very impressive, on

04:28.328 --> 04:33.653
what his plans were. He already had some master 
plan drawings that had been prepared by some

04:33.753 --> 04:40.800
architects, which pretty well It has not been a 
great change from that until here.

04:47.973 --> 04:52.900
There's a lot of changes, but the general broad 
concept was there. And he made a very impressive

04:53.681 --> 04:55.703
presentation. What was impressive about it? 
Well, just the scope of it, the type of planning. He

05:02.852 --> 05:10.922
had hired Ian McHarg, who was really well-known, 
what you might call environmental planner now. He

05:11.273 --> 05:15.078
was into doing the kind of planning that people 
talk about today. 20 years ago, he was doing that

05:15.098 --> 05:29.557
planning, how you would plan the land, study the 
soils, the vegetation, the natural drainage

05:15.098 --> 05:29.557
areas, the geology of the land, and then use that as 
a base for then doing your land planning. Were you

05:29.798 --> 05:36.106
intrigued then with the fact that it didn't seem to 
be a typical kind of development? That's right.

05:37.388 --> 05:40.572
That it wasn't typical, and also it was on a large 
scale. and was going to be a quality development.

05:45.041 --> 05:50.126
He had also hired William L. Praer, who was an 
architect, who I knew from California. Because

05:50.487 --> 05:56.532
William L. Praer, when I was at the University of 
California, each of the campuses had a consulting

05:50.487 --> 05:56.532
architect. And we had one for, at that time, we were 
starting Santa Cruz, San Diego, and Irvine. And I

06:02.918 --> 06:06.141
had William L. Praer as my consulting architect. 
Isn't that right? See, I was the university

06:06.842 --> 06:09.124
architect. So I knew Pereira real well, and he was 
doing the master planning, the land plan based on

06:09.290 --> 06:17.702
all the environmental planning that Ian McHarg 
was doing. And then they had other financial

06:18.323 --> 06:28.017
consultants and people who were in kind of market 
analysis and so forth. But it's just the way Mr.

06:28.037 --> 06:32.023
Mitchell described it was very impressive. Plus, 
as I say, the scale of it. So then I think the next

06:35.362 --> 06:49.358
thing that's happened is that a small group of the 
regents, I remember the chairman came out, and I

06:35.362 --> 06:49.358
think Mrs. Wortham even came out. The chairman, I 
think, was Colonel Bates at the time. And anyway, a

06:52.261 --> 06:56.767
small group of us came out to have a tour of the 
woodlands. And after that, we had a meeting, and I

06:57.848 --> 07:02.533
had recommended that we negotiate with the 
Mitchell Company to acquire the land for the North

07:03.020 --> 07:08.366
Campus. So it was my job then to work with the people 
who were what is now called the Woodlands

07:08.446 --> 07:15.353
Corporation. This is a small group of people who 
were involved in doing the planning at that time.

07:20.338 --> 07:25.123
So I was representing the University of Houston, 
negotiating with them to acquire the land. And I

07:25.163 --> 07:28.707
had determined that we should get 400 acres of 
land. And so I had a number of meetings with Mr.

07:29.463 --> 07:34.488
Mitchell's planning staff at that time. And then I 
had occasion to meet with him a couple of times. And

07:38.671 --> 07:42.255
I was impressed with him and the plans that were 
underway. And that was satisfactorily

07:43.496 --> 07:46.278
concluded. We reached an agreement on the land. We 
had options to get it subject to approval by the

07:48.000 --> 07:51.483
coordinating board and the state. And then that 
probably concluded that maybe around 71 or

07:57.813 --> 08:00.016
something like that. And then of course we had to do 
a lot of paperwork. And I don't know, for one reason

08:03.781 --> 08:27.094
or the other, 73 I made the decision because of my 
opportunities to meet Mr. Mitchell and being

08:03.781 --> 08:27.094
impressed with him and what he was planning, I 
thought it would be wonderful to come here because

08:03.781 --> 08:27.094
I'd seen all that kind of planning and development 
take place at the Irvine Ranch when I was at Irvine.

08:27.749 --> 08:30.492
And I liked the scale of that size of operation. 
Now, you're an architect. You were . Right, right,

08:32.274 --> 08:34.997
right. So I liked that type of operation. So 
anyway, I made the decision to leave the

08:38.722 --> 08:46.631
University of Houston in 1973 and come with the 
Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation.

08:48.012 --> 08:52.518
And we then had our offices in One Shell Plaza, 
downtown Houston. And in 1974, April of 74, we

08:57.297 --> 09:01.122
moved into this building. And this was the only 
building that was here in the Woodlands at that

09:01.142 --> 09:03.886
time. The access was Woodlands Parkway here, and 
that was about the end of the roads. What was your

09:10.476 --> 09:13.320
job when you first came on? Pretty much what it is 
now. At that time, I was involved more in the

09:15.363 --> 09:21.191
overall general planning. And when we moved here, 
as we started the building program, I moved into

09:26.558 --> 09:28.580
building development. And my title now is senior 
vice president for design and construction. In

09:35.006 --> 09:40.091
the beginning, I was heading up all building 
development that included residential also. We

09:41.212 --> 09:53.284
weren't doing much in the way of residential 
development ourselves as a company, because what

09:41.212 --> 09:53.284
we did was plan the land, put in the roads, 
utilities, and plat it. And then we would sell the

09:53.304 --> 09:55.907
lots to the individual Home builders. To the home 
builders. You didn't hold those lots and then when

09:59.438 --> 10:04.925
the building was built, jointly sell? No, we would 
just sell it to the builders. A builder would buy 10

10:07.928 --> 10:10.351
lots or 50 lots. He would then build out those, sell 
those. But we did build some townhouses called

10:14.356 --> 10:20.963
Settler's Corner Townhouses, which was our first 
residential development. And I was involved in

10:22.105 --> 10:24.848
the second phase of the build out of those. The 
first phase was the first occupants on the

10:27.161 --> 10:35.790
woodlands in the first phase of that Settler's 
Corner development. And when I got here, I took

10:35.810 --> 10:52.827
over finishing up the second phase of that and then 
finishing up some of the work at the wharf and the

10:35.810 --> 10:52.827
Indian Country Club, things that had still not 
been finished when we moved out here. And then

10:53.532 --> 10:56.936
pretty much got into building development. We 
then did planning for some apartments. And of

11:00.680 --> 11:03.903
course, at that time, we were also doing some 
office buildings. We did four of these buildings,

11:03.943 --> 11:06.346
this one right here. There's one right over there, 
and one across the other corner, and one over here.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.611
So we did four of these buildings. That came a 
couple of years after we had built this one. What's

11:15.295 --> 11:17.277
your role in terms of the design? Well, let me 
amplify that question a little bit.

11:22.287 --> 11:28.318
Historically, I noticed the Woodlands has a 
homogenous architectural style to it. Not just

11:28.338 --> 11:31.003
the buildings here, but the residential areas as 
well. Where did that come from? How did that

11:33.047 --> 11:34.149
develop? And I guess the other thing I'd like to 
know is a little bit more precisely, or nuts and

11:35.051 --> 11:44.869
bolts, how you integrate or work, you know, your 
efforts at design and planning and with

11:45.220 --> 11:53.372
everything else that's going on around here? 
Okay. There's a few ways that it works. We have

11:55.795 --> 12:03.787
in our division, commercial industrial division 
of the Williams Corporate. You probably know

12:04.027 --> 12:06.891
there's residential, commercial, industrial. 
And then there's what they call Mitchell

12:07.360 --> 12:10.764
Southwest. Those are the major divisions of the 
Williams Corporation. And then we have staff

12:14.169 --> 12:18.895
departments of planning, engineering, legal, 
and so forth. In our division, we have what we call a

12:18.915 --> 12:27.066
regular land development meeting and a regular 
building development meeting. And what we do at

12:27.086 --> 12:34.836
those meetings is bring in all the plans or 
proposals for land sales for review by the people

12:35.221 --> 12:37.784
that attend that meeting. It'd be just like a 
campus planning committee. It's almost the same

12:41.569 --> 12:43.953
thing as we had a campus planning committee. All 
proposals come in. They'd be reviewed at that

12:45.775 --> 13:03.118
committee for conformance with our general plan, 
conformance with our marketing program, and then

12:45.775 --> 13:03.118
to determine the availability of the site in terms 
of utilities or roads or what have you. So that's

13:03.571 --> 13:06.955
how the land plans would come in. Building plans 
come in the same way. As we determine that we're

13:09.758 --> 13:17.988
going to do, let's say we're going to do an office 
building, we'll select an architect to design

13:09.758 --> 13:17.988
that building. We develop a budget for it. We do a 
pro forma for it. Know what I mean by pro forma? It's

13:25.056 --> 13:29.040
the economic model for that particular building 
project. And then as we... get the concept design,

13:32.157 --> 13:36.722
we review that at our building development 
meeting. Again, just like the campus planning

13:36.742 --> 13:38.685
committee meeting. And we then get the input from 
everyone who's involved in that, and that would

13:39.486 --> 13:59.369
include maybe the sales and leasing people, the 
property management people, our construction

13:39.486 --> 13:59.369
people, our planning people, in terms of what do 
they think about that, how does that conform with

13:39.486 --> 13:59.369
our design guidelines, what we're trying to 
accomplish. And of course, You know, it can vary a

14:01.992 --> 14:09.424
little bit with the site, but generally because of 
the participants involved, there's some

14:01.992 --> 14:09.424
continuity there. We also have what we call a 
development standards committee within the

14:10.145 --> 14:17.357
woodlands, which is a part of the organization or 
the creation of the woodlands. The development

14:18.659 --> 14:26.312
standards committee is set up as an overall design 
review board. all plans for development within

14:27.068 --> 14:45.724
the woodlands, which includes not only our 
company's plans, but for any developer who buys

14:27.068 --> 14:45.724
land for us, any home builder, all those plans have 
to go through for approval, for design and

14:27.068 --> 14:45.724
conformance with the development standards that 
have been created and adopted by the woodlands. So

14:46.725 --> 14:47.886
there's a lot of review. Is that part of the deed 
restriction, basically? It's part of the deed

14:51.309 --> 14:52.550
restriction. It's part of the woodlands charter. 
Who developed the standards? We did. The

15:00.531 --> 15:03.975
Woodlands Corporation prepared the standards. 
We employed consultants. This goes back probably

15:05.356 --> 15:07.679
17, 18. Is that before you came? No, I was involved 
in the initial commercial industrial standards.

15:16.289 --> 15:26.640
We employed consultants to give us advice on the 
standards, not only for here, but then in the

15:16.289 --> 15:26.640
Woodlands Trade Center, which is an 800-acre 
parcel north of here. And we employed consultants

15:27.532 --> 15:38.786
who were expert in doing that kind of work to give us 
recommendations, which we would then review and

15:27.532 --> 15:38.786
decide what we'd want to adopt. Did the commercial 
industrial sector develop early on, or was that

15:39.146 --> 15:44.653
sort of a spin-off later? All the building 
development, I said it was in one area at one time.

15:49.399 --> 15:55.767
And then at that time, our organization of the 
company was along, what I'd say, functional

15:49.399 --> 15:55.767
lines. There was just, you know, like planning and 
building design, and then there was sales and

15:56.202 --> 16:01.109
leasing. Do you think you made your residential at 
that time? No, no. The sales and leasing, in other

16:04.995 --> 16:15.490
words, the vice president for, let's say, 
marketing, sales and leasing, also handled

16:04.995 --> 16:15.490
residential, commercial, industrial, 
everything. We were all kind of straight line down

16:15.530 --> 16:17.894
like that. When I think it was Ed Lee became 
president of the company, he reorganized it from

16:24.232 --> 16:29.900
like a functional department into operating 
divisions. And then each operating division had

16:31.022 --> 16:40.055
the responsibility for their planning, design, 
construction, marketing, sales, leasing, all

16:31.022 --> 16:40.055
within that division. So residential was created 
as a separate division, commercial industrial as

16:40.095 --> 16:53.614
another, and then all the other properties, which 
includes, you know, Cape Royal and Pirates Beach

16:40.095 --> 16:53.614
and Galveston and all that was all put under what is 
called Mitchell Southwest Properties. So each of

16:57.041 --> 16:59.043
those divisions then had a head. And then within 
each division are people who are responsible for

16:59.103 --> 17:08.054
carrying out the marketing goals for that 
division. So I fit in the commercial industrial

17:08.755 --> 17:15.163
division responsible for building design and 
construction. When the commercial industrial

17:16.364 --> 17:21.070
division was developed independently, was there 
already a pretty good format or policy or program

17:21.505 --> 17:28.934
in mind as to where you're going and what you're 
going to try to do in terms of development? Yes, in a

17:28.954 --> 17:30.416
general way. But in commercial industrial,

17:30.557 --> 17:38.266
of course, residential is the same way. You're 
very dependent on the market. I mean, you can make

17:40.629 --> 17:42.392
all the plans you want. But if nobody wants to buy 
it, it doesn't mean anything. And so we started off

17:46.345 --> 17:58.404
with this area right where we're at being our 
initial commercial development, because we had

17:46.345 --> 17:58.404
this street in, we had that street in, and we had the 
beginning of this street here. So in order to

17:59.206 --> 18:08.641
minimize your costs, you tend to want to put your 
buildings in the area where you had all your money

17:59.206 --> 18:08.641
in roads and utilities, because you want to put a 
building here. It may cost you $2 million to get

18:09.402 --> 18:12.707
from here to there. to build a building that may 
have cost $3 million. So you just don't do it. So

18:18.314 --> 18:20.637
what you try to do is we try to cluster there. But 
then as the road would get extended to here and then

18:20.737 --> 18:38.458
maybe a piece of the road go here, then we develop 
maybe a cluster of parcels around that point and

18:20.737 --> 18:38.458
would say, OK, our marketing strategy is to sell 
these parcels to small office users. like maybe

18:38.928 --> 18:47.197
medical building or small lot users for 
development. And then we would create an area over

18:47.217 --> 18:56.247
here that would be available for large 
purchasers, like Pennzoil, who bought 40 acres

18:47.217 --> 18:56.247
from us, for example. So we did have a marketing 
plan, but we could have a situation where somebody

18:56.287 --> 19:08.800
would come in and say, well, I want 15 acres, and I 
want it here, and I want this, and this, and this. If

19:09.134 --> 19:15.984
we want to try to make a sale, we've got to be 
responsive to them within reason as to what we

19:09.134 --> 19:15.984
could afford to do. I'm talking now on third-party 
sales. Now, where we are building the building

19:21.632 --> 19:37.234
ourself, it would be because we want to build the 
buildings for our own account because we saw the

19:21.632 --> 19:37.234
opportunity to build that building and lease that 
space, and it makes it then an investment

19:21.632 --> 19:37.234
opportunity for us. Plus, it enhances the 
overall. Plus, it also sort of seeds the market.

19:42.683 --> 19:47.490
Because if you had something going and get some 
people there, it then makes it more attractive for

19:42.683 --> 19:47.490
us. That's right. Well, also, we built this 
building to house all our real estate offices. We

19:53.719 --> 19:55.441
moved here, as I said, in 74. And we needed this 
building as a place to operate from. And then as we

20:00.687 --> 20:05.531
had this, we built this building over there, and 
then these two over there. And once we had this,

20:06.172 --> 20:10.876
then we leased the other buildings to other users. 
Plus it gave us some expansion for other

20:10.976 --> 20:15.139
departments and divisions of the company. After 
this nucleus of commercial buildings developed,

20:16.040 --> 20:29.952
which were all basically woodland coal and 
energy, what was the first big drill, you might

20:16.040 --> 20:29.952
say, right through our sale to a commercial? Well, 
let's see. I think the largest commercial land

20:31.584 --> 20:35.830
sale was Pennzoil for 40 acres. And I can't 
remember when that was, but I'm going to guess that

20:36.651 --> 20:40.736
was maybe 10 years ago. Had there been much before 
Pennzoil? Oh, we've had other land sales in the

20:45.603 --> 20:52.412
Woodlands Trade Center, Eckerd Drug 
Distribution Center was a good one. I don't know

20:53.434 --> 20:56.698
how many acres that is, maybe 20 acres or something 
like that. That was a good sale. Yeah, that's been

20:58.349 --> 20:59.991
there a long time, too. Yeah, that was the first 
company to come into the Woodlands Trade Center.

21:07.280 --> 21:20.257
And that probably was probably, I'm going to 
guess, in maybe a 77, 78 time period, something

21:07.280 --> 21:20.257
like that. I kind of forget some of those years.

21:25.754 --> 21:30.199
Those were probably two of the larger land sales. 
We've had a number of other sales for smaller

21:30.279 --> 21:37.507
buildings throughout the woodlands. How would 
you departmentalize, or maybe you shouldn't

21:40.110 --> 21:44.956
even, the commercial development projects? In 
other words, I guess the mall is coming on, and you

21:44.976 --> 21:50.181
have the medical area. I don't know if you could 
think of that as a distinct program,

21:55.589 --> 21:58.773
complex, what other complex ? Well, we have, as far 
as the major areas of development, we have where

22:00.275 --> 22:08.265
the regional mall will be located, Interstate 45. 
Are you directly involved in that? I'm directly

22:10.507 --> 22:11.889
involved in it. However, we have a partnership 
agreement with the HOMART company. HOMART is the

22:16.375 --> 22:19.439
development arm of Sears. They're headquartered 
in Chicago. We are putting in the land in the deal.

22:25.137 --> 22:29.442
And Home Art will be the developers of that mall. 
They will also lease and operate the mall. We have a

22:33.467 --> 22:41.316
joint design approval on the design of the 
buildings. And we, of course, are donating the

22:42.457 --> 22:44.920
land. So we've been very much involved in the 
planning of the land, not only for the mall, but all

22:45.420 --> 22:51.988
the land around the mall. For example, we're doing 
a study right now. This is more current. I get back

22:57.042 --> 23:02.728
to your question as far as major areas, but this is 
an area that we're planning right now, for

22:57.042 --> 23:02.728
example. This is the southern part of the mall. 
Interstate 45 is right here. This is Timberlock.

23:09.315 --> 23:11.978
And we're in an office probably down here 
somewhere. So this is just an idea of a study plan

23:13.519 --> 23:18.344
for this particular area. And we want to... We want 
to begin the design on two or three major buildings

23:23.474 --> 23:32.566
in this area because we have the long range plans to 
develop the small. We want to develop this lake

23:33.166 --> 23:40.896
here, which will act as a reservoir for flood 
control, but also can become an amenity. So in

23:41.437 --> 23:46.123
order to locate where the initial buildings would 
go, we had to do this planning study. for the

23:46.711 --> 23:54.298
alignment of these roads and the development of 
these parcels to determine how we lay the whole

23:46.711 --> 23:54.298
thing out to then determine where the initial 
buildings should go. So this is the kind of work I

23:55.259 --> 24:10.534
do, working with our sales and leasing people who 
say, you know, these are the kind of buildings we

23:55.259 --> 24:10.534
ought to have, this is about roughly this size, so 
we have something to start with. And I would work

24:11.074 --> 24:13.056
with our planning people on the land plan of this 
area important, then I'd be responsible for

24:13.542 --> 24:23.755
coordinating this planning to come to an 
agreement within our group as to where we would

24:13.542 --> 24:23.755
begin. And then once we begin, we resolve this 
planning, then I'd be working directly with the

24:23.795 --> 24:33.067
architects who we'd select to design the 
buildings. You always go outside to do this? Yeah,

24:37.632 --> 24:39.915
we only have four people on our staff. We're very 
busy. with the work that we've got going. To do the

24:45.089 --> 24:49.215
kind of work we'd have to have dozens of people. 
You're a management group. Yes, we're just four

24:51.017 --> 24:55.724
persons who manage everything that we have going 
on. So we've got, I mean, there's those lists up

24:56.405 --> 25:01.813
there. I mean, that's just the first page of about 
three or four pages of projects that are going. So

25:07.441 --> 25:10.566
we employ, consult, we farm everything out. Our 
job is to manage the contracts with all the

25:11.137 --> 25:16.763
consultants that we employ. We hire soil 
engineers, structural engineers, surveyors,

25:16.843 --> 25:32.500
architects, structural engineers, mechanical 
engineers, electrical engineers, illumination

25:16.843 --> 25:32.500
engineers, interior designers, landscape 
architects. So we're hiring all those people and

25:32.581 --> 25:39.388
managing this whole process from beginning to end 
and then coordinating in-house to arrive at the

25:39.942 --> 25:44.849
final product, and then also controlling the 
budget and the schedule. It's kind of complex. It

25:48.253 --> 25:48.373
is. It's very complex. If you're just doing, say, 
one at a time, and if you could just concentrate on

25:49.475 --> 25:55.923
one, it would be kind of fun. But our situation is we 
throw up a whole bunch of balls in the air, and we

25:56.725 --> 26:00.990
keep moving. You've got to try to keep them up in the 
air. And this is just really starting. Right. This

26:08.870 --> 26:11.033
is just starting. There's nothing here. This road 
is in to I-45, and then there's nothing here. So

26:19.526 --> 26:25.274
this is just the beginning of a small phase of this 
development in what we're now calling the town

26:19.526 --> 26:25.274
center. So this will be a fascinating development 
as this goes on. But anyway, you were asking about

26:30.365 --> 26:33.993
the different areas. The mall is one large area. 
There'll be development that will take place

26:36.900 --> 26:41.791
around the periphery of that area. Another major 
component is the Trade Center, which is a rail

26:43.154 --> 26:49.268
serve distribution center type of complex. been 
there about 10 or 12 years, the nucleus or the? Oh,

26:52.306 --> 26:56.952
it's been, well, I mean, the Trade Center as a land 
parcel has been there since we started. But the

26:57.453 --> 27:01.578
first building development was at the Drug and 
Distribution Center. And that, I'm thinking, was

27:02.239 --> 27:05.303
we moved here in 74. That was like 77 or 78, 
somewhere around that, I'm guessing. And that's

27:11.531 --> 27:15.276
really exploded, not exploded, but it has 
developed nicely. Yeah, it's developed nicely.

27:17.648 --> 27:19.250
You expect much more in that area? Oh, yes. But the 
commercial development, I would say, has not gone

27:21.092 --> 27:38.450
as rapid as we had estimated when we began, mostly 
because there have been so many variations in the

27:21.092 --> 27:38.450
economy and outside influences affecting what we 
do. And there are just forces that you can't

27:39.451 --> 27:45.698
control in this business.

27:46.960 --> 27:52.665
probably we started planning our Esplanade 
property, which is south of Greensboro Mall area.

27:52.705 --> 27:55.728
We have 180 acres there along Interstate 45. We had 
hired a planning firm from Dallas, and we had

27:57.009 --> 28:08.579
probably started maybe about 1979, 1980 on the 
master planning for that development. Very

28:08.659 --> 28:09.900
intense planning. And we probably got the 
planning done, all our approvals. rented space in

28:15.968 --> 28:21.897
an office building down there that overlooks the 
site, built a big exhibition center there. And by

28:22.878 --> 28:24.861
that time, it was about 1983 or 82. And boy, we were 
just going terrific, just like this. And we got to

28:30.489 --> 28:31.571
the top. We looked terrific. Then we looked down, 
and it went just like that. And we had hired the

28:34.595 --> 28:39.923
sales director to open that place up, and he opened 
it up. And we probably closed it six months later.

28:44.318 --> 28:46.721
Is everything still there, pending now? No, the 
lease is gone, and the furniture is spread all

28:47.182 --> 28:53.289
around this building. I don't know where the 
models are anymore. We had these huge models with

28:55.672 --> 28:58.636
lights and everything. It was beautifully done, 
beautifully done. It's just that, like a lot of

29:00.999 --> 29:13.414
other people, no one could foresee the economic 
decline that was going to take place in the Houston

29:00.999 --> 29:13.414
area when the oil business went went down and had 
you know tremendous tremendous impact on the

29:13.597 --> 29:42.912
Houston area so I'm not telling you anything new 
and of course it did here and since we are so far out

29:13.597 --> 29:42.912
from the Houston area we may have been affected up 
here sooner than other areas because most people

29:13.597 --> 29:42.912
tend to you know cluster towards the downtown area 
but I don't know if there's any perceptible time

29:13.597 --> 29:42.912
difference between the two but We noticed it, and 
we started cutting back. We had bids on an office

29:46.108 --> 29:53.295
building, a 12-story office building that we were 
going to build at the end of Timberlock, down near

29:46.108 --> 29:53.295
where this site is. We had the bids. We had just 
already left the contract, and we stopped on that

29:54.777 --> 29:59.121
project. So those were difficult times. But now, 
the Woodlands seemed, in a way, to have weathered

30:04.246 --> 30:09.591
that, especially in terms of residential 
buildings. Better than none in a lot of other

30:10.128 --> 30:11.490
areas. Well, the rest, I would say that the wind has 
weathered it. It was very difficult times. We cut

30:18.781 --> 30:22.026
back severely in our staff. And I probably had, I 
think, maybe 14 people working at one time. None of

30:27.214 --> 30:27.854
us were. Well, the two in 10 improvement were sick. 
So we cut more than half of the people away. Anyway,

30:34.685 --> 30:39.612
the commercial really got cut back. And we didn't 
do very much. I'm trying to think of what we did do

30:42.840 --> 30:47.086
for a couple of years there. Just small, small 
work. Residential dropped a way off. And that

30:53.414 --> 30:58.661
period probably lasted maybe four or five years. 
But then we noticed in residential maybe four

30:59.542 --> 31:05.650
years ago that our residential sales were picking 
up. And then the next year was really good, and the

31:06.811 --> 31:11.998
next year was even better, and the next year was 
better than that. It just kept up going like this.

31:14.421 --> 31:23.593
Well, what was happening is that while there were 
less people buying homes, the people who were

31:14.421 --> 31:23.593
buying were going to the planned communities. So 
the Woodlands was getting a much larger share of

31:24.834 --> 31:30.061
the market than what it was getting before. And I 
would assume it was because the people who were

31:30.121 --> 31:33.966
buying because of what they'd seen had happened to 
values of homes and properties and everything,

31:34.570 --> 31:52.733
were going to the planned communities because 
they just instinctively recognized that there's

31:34.570 --> 31:52.733
where the value was because homes in the planned 
communities held up better than in a typical

31:34.570 --> 31:52.733
suburban development. So our home sales started 
to do good and have been very good. I mean, last year

31:58.561 --> 32:00.523
was good. The year before that was good. And this 
year has been excellent. Now, you should be

32:04.945 --> 32:08.568
getting a commercial spinoff somewhere along the 
way. Well, that's right, because just as when we

32:08.588 --> 32:21.460
began, we had very little commercial, and we 
didn't have anything in the way of retail

32:08.588 --> 32:21.460
services, you know, shops, stores, markets, or 
what have you. We developed the population. That

32:26.926 --> 32:30.689
population then wanted to have a drugstore and a 
grocery store and so forth. So then, in following

32:30.729 --> 32:33.872
your question, One of our other major areas of 
development in commercial were the village

32:34.055 --> 32:39.441
shopping centers. So we built a village shopping 
center in Grover's Mill Village, and we did

32:39.762 --> 32:48.072
another one several years later at Panther Creek 
Village Center. And, in fact, we're in the midst of

32:49.093 --> 32:54.680
remodeling Panther Creek because that's been so 
successful. We're going to enlarge the Randall

32:55.460 --> 33:01.007
supermarket and do some revisions to the center. 
to continue the expansion of that. And we have done

33:03.198 --> 33:08.270
some advanced planning on another site along 
Research Forest Drive. And those really were not

33:08.650 --> 33:12.860
part of the original planning. Yeah, they were. 
The basis of the original general plan was to have a

33:14.964 --> 33:19.975
series of villages. Yeah. Like six villages. And 
each village would have some geographical

33:22.077 --> 33:36.249
definition to it and would have a group of schools, 
churches, shopping centers that were related to

33:22.077 --> 33:36.249
the scale of that village. So yes, we always had in 
the plan, planning would just have like a blob on

33:36.269 --> 33:45.958
the map that this is a site for a general, this is set 
for a village center. So then when we were ready,

33:48.220 --> 33:54.028
we'd say, okay, we'll take that piece of land, and 
then we then will develop that piece of land. Then I

33:54.649 --> 34:12.594
would hire planners and architects and so forth to 
then plan that piece of land so that we can build

33:54.649 --> 34:12.594
that out for our market program to have a 
supermarket and a drugstore and dry cleaners and

33:54.649 --> 34:12.594
all the other things that go with having a village 
center. So going back, so you had the trade center,

34:12.614 --> 34:17.721
you have the... regional mall area, you have the 
office buildings, you have the village centers.

34:23.682 --> 34:34.077
Now another large area of our planning 
development has been the Woodlands Inn and

34:23.682 --> 34:34.077
Country Club, which is now called the Woodlands 
Executive Conference Center and Country Club and

34:23.682 --> 34:34.077
Resort. So we had to be nucleus of the executive 
center and the country club when we opened. since

34:45.646 --> 35:13.257
that time we've done a lot of remodeling of the 
existing buildings to continue upgrading the

34:45.646 --> 35:13.257
quality of the facilities and we've made a major 
conversion of one building which we called the

34:45.646 --> 35:13.257
wharf which was like a small mall and we remodeled 
that completely to provide expansion for the

34:45.646 --> 35:13.257
woodlands in for conference meeting rooms the 
mall died right yeah the mall was designed Like,

35:13.912 --> 35:24.643
here's the parking lot, and the mall was a long, 
narrow building this way, rather than taking a

35:13.912 --> 35:24.643
building and putting it this way, like a strip 
center where all the stores could have

35:13.912 --> 35:24.643
visibility. It was this way, so you had to get out of 
your car, walk into that mall, and walk through it

35:24.683 --> 35:29.488
like this. Well, that might work in an area where 
you've got, say, a million people. You know, all

35:34.113 --> 35:38.358
the apartments are out here, and then that becomes 
convenient for them. But when you're in a suburban

35:38.378 --> 35:43.243
area like this, that just wasn't... the thing to 
do. And that never was successful. We had it almost

35:46.717 --> 35:48.540
all leased up. We had an ice skating rink in there. 
And it started out leased up, but it became

35:52.085 --> 35:58.455
apparent that it was premature. Because we only 
had a few hundred people here. And as you know, to

36:03.242 --> 36:10.513
support a hardware store or something like that, 
you may need a population of 7,000 just to support a

36:03.242 --> 36:10.513
hardware store. We just didn't have the 
population, so it was premature to start that

36:11.185 --> 36:15.570
development. So it was one of the big mistakes. 
We've made some mistakes, and we've learned as

36:17.933 --> 36:20.717
we've gone along.

36:23.440 --> 36:27.946
When did the concept of a medical center develop in 
terms of building? Well, we

36:27.986 --> 36:37.918
had in our general plan the intent to have a 
hospital.

36:39.265 --> 36:47.817
The idea of getting the hospital in was moved ahead 
when I think it was Humana. I think they wanted to

36:48.237 --> 36:54.626
either develop inside or outside the woodlands. 
And we had already had started a plan for a family

36:55.488 --> 37:02.978
health center within the woodlands in a small 
building up Borges Mill Road. with the intent that

37:03.481 --> 37:10.368
we would then go from there to the hospital as the 
population grew and the need developed to support

37:03.481 --> 37:10.368
that. They came in to, and then they had to file a, 
what is it called, a certificate of, they had to

37:10.408 --> 37:19.598
file for a certificate of need or something like 
that for the state. Well, we then got in

37:20.439 --> 37:26.645
competition with them, went through all our 
studies to support what we wanted to do. We

37:27.346 --> 37:28.968
submitted ours to the state. We got our approval 
based on that. We then created a board to own the

37:33.907 --> 37:37.673
hospital. We then hired the architects and 
designed and supervised the construction of that

37:38.794 --> 37:47.307
hospital, turned that over to that board. So that 
was the nuclear stand-alone? Yes. Then from

37:51.313 --> 38:02.530
there, there has been developed a private 
development, which is a three-story medical

37:51.313 --> 38:02.530
office building on Lakefront Circle Drive. And 
then we built a small professional building that

38:03.337 --> 38:08.483
connects to the hospital. And the intent is that 
that area would then be the center of other

38:09.484 --> 38:20.536
medical-type buildings around the hospital and 
the hospital design so it could incrementally

38:09.484 --> 38:20.536
expand.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.342
And do you see a lot of expansion developing in that 
area? Are you doing much with that right now? Not

38:27.884 --> 38:28.625
too much. We had a second professional building 
planned And we have not gone ahead with it because I

38:31.906 --> 38:43.322
think that the leasing activity has been very 
slow, just as it has been in all kinds of commercial

38:31.906 --> 38:43.322
office spaces. And so we have not gone ahead and 
done that building. Is your prime focus right now

38:47.568 --> 38:49.852
the wall, basically? I mean, you personally. 
Personally, well, right now I'm involved in

38:50.973 --> 38:59.145
buildings here in the woodlands. buildings in 
Galveston, and then I work on buildings that Mr.

38:59.834 --> 39:08.687
Mitchell personally owns in Galveston. In what 
way do you work on them? Well, he has bought a number

39:13.353 --> 39:21.244
of old buildings in Galveston in the Strand area, 
which are pretty dilapidated. And he started this

39:22.366 --> 39:28.795
probably around 1975 or 76. when this program of, 
there were tax benefits for him, and also this

39:29.348 --> 39:45.874
occurred about the same time that Galveston had 
created the Galveston Historical Foundation.

39:45.954 --> 39:50.361
And a new man was brought in, his name was Peter 
Brink, They had raised some money through a pool,

39:50.915 --> 40:01.911
through the local banks, to try to buy some of these 
old buildings before they were torn down because

39:50.915 --> 40:01.911
it was a great collection of 1800s buildings. 
Well, the National Register, too, came in and

40:02.932 --> 40:05.396
surveyed them. Yeah, then what they did, they 
worked with the Department of the Interior to get

40:05.416 --> 40:19.977
that area declared a historical district so 
people couldn't come in and turn them into a pizza

40:05.416 --> 40:19.977
parlor some kind of a joint or what have you, which 
happened elsewhere, or tear the building down and

40:20.564 --> 40:26.191
make a parking lot out of it. And so they were just 
beginning to try to get that underway about the

40:27.292 --> 40:34.000
same time Mr. Mitchell got interested in doing it. 
And I was involved in the first building that he

40:35.142 --> 40:41.369
purchased, and we went from there. And he's now 
acquired a number of buildings, which we have then

40:41.429 --> 40:48.698
purchased and then adapted the use of that 
building to other uses and to completely restore

40:48.863 --> 40:55.730
the exterior and the interior of the building. The 
Tremont House is the biggest one we did. We did the

40:58.713 --> 41:09.664
T. Jeff Leak building and the Marine building, 
Hutchins-Sealy building, Hunter building,

40:58.713 --> 41:09.664
Sealy-Hutchins building. You then managed those 
properties as well? I don't manage them. I was

41:13.287 --> 41:15.850
responsible for the design and construction. 
That's what I meant, though. Yeah, yeah, right.

41:18.850 --> 41:25.137
No,

41:18.850 --> 41:25.137
Colorado is mostly land development. We own what 
was originally 1,600 acres of land between Aspen

41:26.017 --> 41:37.569
and Owl Creek, which was called, I mean Aspen and 
Snowmass, which was called Owl Creek. And because

41:37.589 --> 41:45.938
of Pitkin County and the city of Aspen's no growth 
posture, it's taken years to be able to get a permit

41:37.589 --> 41:45.938
to even develop that land. So we now have developed 
some of that land, and we've been selling large,

41:47.916 --> 41:55.990
they're very large lots, but they sell for about a 
million, two million dollars. So we finally got

41:57.854 --> 42:00.679
that going. We did own interest in some buildings 
in Aspen, but we've since sold those off. We did

42:08.774 --> 42:10.677
that mostly during the 70s. And we now have an 
interest in some land called Lake Catamount,

42:11.737 --> 42:24.154
which is about seven miles south of

42:11.737 --> 42:24.154
Snowmass again. That's not right. Steamboat 
Springs. That's where the ski lift is going to be on

42:27.059 --> 42:30.543
Catamount? Well, what we're in the final throes of 
obtaining now is the ski permit. And this has taken

42:37.233 --> 42:39.917
a lot of work. Dick Brown has been the person. from 
our company who has been primarily working on that

42:41.842 --> 43:08.119
because that's been more a planning function and 
then when we get into the development part of it

42:41.842 --> 43:08.119
then probably other people will get involved if 
there's any building development from our

42:41.842 --> 43:08.119
standpoint we'll probably get involved in it 
would you say the prime motive of the commercial

42:41.842 --> 43:08.119
development in the woodlands has been to provide 
jobs for people who move here to make money for for

42:41.842 --> 43:08.119
the woodlands corporation all of the above, or how 
does that fit into the scheme of things? Well, it

43:12.632 --> 43:33.875
fits in the scheme in that what we're trying to do to 
make the whole woodland successful is to make it

43:12.632 --> 43:33.875
truly a new community and not have it just be a 
bedroom community where you live and then you

43:12.632 --> 43:33.875
commute 20 or 30 miles to some other place, work 
there, then come back here, sleep at night, and

43:12.632 --> 43:33.875
repeat that process. So what we've been trying to 
do is create a job base here. And so it serves a

43:37.394 --> 43:40.437
number of purposes. One, by creating a job base 
here, that means that people can buy a home here,

43:40.858 --> 43:48.106
find a job here. It gets away from this business of 
people commuting all over the place. So we're

43:52.311 --> 44:02.102
really trying to create a new town or a satellite 
community, just like in new towns in Sweden and

43:52.311 --> 44:02.102
Finland and England and France. although their 
approach is different. They just say, you know,

44:04.967 --> 44:09.372
this is going to be it, and you will go there, and 
that's where you're going to be. We're subject to

44:09.833 --> 44:21.626
the market forces of our economy, and we can't 
control anything except try to do a better job and

44:09.833 --> 44:21.626
give a better product at a better price to hope that 
people will then come in and move here. So that's

44:22.567 --> 44:24.289
one part of it. Another part of it is to make money, 
to make a profit to pay for this, because if we don't

44:25.470 --> 44:31.077
make a profit, we go broke, and nothing happens. 
So... One, we're trying to keep a job base. By

44:35.419 --> 44:38.763
creating a job base, that makes it attractive for 
people to move in. When people are moving in, that

44:39.424 --> 44:47.534
makes it attractive for retail people, the 
hardware store guy and the drug store guy, to move

44:39.424 --> 44:47.534
in because these people are here. So you get a 
synergy going of these things affecting each

44:48.075 --> 44:51.719
other. And then, of course, as I say, we hope to, 
because of the tremendous investment we're

44:52.460 --> 45:00.490
putting in the land development here, realize 
some of the value that we're creating and build a

45:00.757 --> 45:07.844
building, hopefully, so we can then lease it and 
make some money off of it.

45:11.027 --> 45:19.135
I'm not sure what this question is, but are there 
any disabilities in putting commercial

45:11.027 --> 45:19.135
establishments here? In other words, what are 
your hurdles in getting people to come in a

45:19.175 --> 45:25.061
commercial context, businesses and so forth? 
Well, it's very difficult because we're

45:25.081 --> 45:29.565
influenced by the whole Houston metropolitan 
economy. In addition, we are some 25 miles plus

45:34.071 --> 45:40.278
from the central business district of Houston.

45:43.903 --> 45:48.609
So it makes it very hard to get people to move out 
here. Generally, we've found that there becomes a

45:48.829 --> 45:59.282
hurting instinct, like West Houston has 
developed tremendously, the West Memorial,

45:48.829 --> 45:59.282
Houston area, Park 10, and all that. I believe 
that's happened because all the managers,

45:59.684 --> 46:12.557
executives that were working downtown Houston 
all lived in that memorial area. When this area

46:12.757 --> 46:17.422
west developed, they could still stay in their 
homes there. The children could go to the same

46:17.462 --> 46:19.023
school. Their wives could go shopping the same 
places. And they could still stay there and have

46:23.248 --> 46:26.651
all their new buildings out here. Just change 
their focus a little bit. That's right. We've been

46:30.903 --> 46:35.870
at a point where we didn't have any trees here. So we 
had to try to attract people to buy into here and

46:36.511 --> 46:43.440
then hope that those people could spin off some 
business or get here. But we've had to really work

46:44.041 --> 46:57.940
it the other way and try to get the companies to 
build buildings here or to leave space for us in the

46:44.041 --> 46:57.940
buildings that we built in the hope of attracting 
them there and hoping that they would grow and then

46:44.041 --> 46:57.940
they would buy houses in the woodlands. So yes, 
that has been very difficult. And unfortunately,

47:00.991 --> 47:05.983
during the time that we have been underway, we 
opened in 74. There was a decline in the economy, if

47:06.505 --> 47:11.136
you remember.
