00:03.710 --> 00:16.622
We do a much better, I would give us an A- on research, but the place that I would give us a low C is on service.

00:17.203 --> 00:20.892
And that's something, and I think the way to

00:20.872 --> 00:27.719
to make a giant, to change the paradigm, make a leap forward is find ways to serve more people on the internet.

00:28.260 --> 00:34.966
Inner city kids are all learning how to use internet and they need to have access to everything A&M offers through that internet.

00:35.307 --> 00:37.929
And I'm not talking about how to get an agree over the internet.

00:38.310 --> 00:42.334
I'm talking about, you know, how you deal with fundamental problems in living.

00:42.774 --> 00:43.956
Finance 101.

00:44.076 --> 00:46.238
How do you do a budget?

00:46.724 --> 01:11.618
You know, Quicken is really great if somebody has the money to do it, but I want to see A&M's business school put a program on the internet that's free so that the welfare mother can learn how to and have help managing her money, so that they learn what credit card companies do to them, so that they learn all the things that we take for granted that help us manage and accumulate wealth.

01:11.598 --> 01:26.485
If I were czar, I would require every graduating senior have to sign a statement, much like you do when you buy a car, that says, it has been explained to me that if I will pay cash for cars,

01:26.836 --> 01:33.190
the rest of my life and bank the payments into a savings account, it will change my net worth by $1 million.

01:33.330 --> 01:34.292
I have gone through this.

01:34.573 --> 01:40.345
I have completed a quiz that demonstrates that I fully understand this principle, and I'll sign this.

01:40.486 --> 01:43.933
And if they can't pass that, they can't graduate from A&M.

01:44.437 --> 01:53.915
Little practical thing, you know, practical things that touch people's lives that we can do, but you've got everyone at the university, that's not sexy.

01:53.935 --> 02:00.647
That's not service to the people is not what the university faculty is about.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.631
It's administration's about.

02:02.611 --> 02:05.154
You know, we know how to teach farmers how to farm better.

02:05.214 --> 02:09.859
We know how to, you know, the hobby shop over at the Applied Science and the Engineering, you know.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.621
They know what they're doing over there.

02:12.062 --> 02:22.814
But this body of knowledge to help, just Joe Sixpack that's paying the bills, we do a shitty job of helping him, and there's so much we could do.

02:23.295 --> 02:24.616
Health, nutrition.

02:24.997 --> 02:29.221
My God, they ought to be telling people how to eat and what to do.

02:29.302 --> 02:32.365
We did the Children's Nutritional Center out here at Baylor.

02:32.345 --> 02:35.534
And we had Kiki de la Garza.

02:35.955 --> 02:37.138
Went up, worked with him.

02:37.158 --> 02:41.230
As Winerti pointed out, he had a great way.

02:41.250 --> 02:48.109
He said, we know about the health and nutrition of rats more about that than we do about babies' health and nutrition.

02:48.089 --> 02:51.235
And so this Children's Nutritional Center is in basic.

02:51.816 --> 02:54.040
A&M, for God's sakes, ought to be a leader in that.

02:54.381 --> 02:59.991
And not just in medicine, but in practical things so that people understand.

03:00.432 --> 03:11.953
If you look what advertising does to low-income people and what we get them to eat, and not only is it high-cost, poor nutrition, it's not good for their health.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.462
You know, we need to attack those programs.

03:14.482 --> 03:17.399
Now, that's the kind of specific that I was looking for.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.108
All right, last question.

03:19.308 --> 03:23.532
What feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M?

03:23.552 --> 03:27.236
Well, Mike Halibutti summed it up.

03:27.276 --> 03:31.881
Mike asked me to speak at the dedication of his, the Halibutti Center.

03:31.941 --> 03:35.865
And it was a great honor because he's always been one of my heroes and kind of a mentor.

03:36.325 --> 03:37.666
We did the Halibutti building.

03:37.726 --> 03:39.368
I got to know him pretty well doing that.

03:40.870 --> 03:46.395
So I spent some time researching Mike to do my speech.

03:48.198 --> 03:54.249
Mike said something that says about it as well as anyone can say it.

03:54.329 --> 03:58.777
He said, Texas A&M is like mama and daddy.

03:58.797 --> 04:01.401
He said, they love you when you're little and ugly.

04:01.421 --> 04:09.636
And said, if you don't remember your mama and daddy, you're just not much of a man.

04:09.676 --> 04:11.840
That's great.

04:11.860 --> 04:12.501
That's great.
