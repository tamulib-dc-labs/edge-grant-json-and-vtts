WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:15.108
I

00:01.752 --> 00:15.108
remember

00:01.752 --> 00:15.108
he came up behind me. I didn't see him face to face. 
He came up behind me. He said, would you like to

00:18.352 --> 00:19.453
dance? And I turned around and said, yes. And our 
family joke is, he asked you what attracted you. He

00:25.481 --> 00:26.322
always told you. And the way she walks. That's the 
way she walks. Oh, he fell in love with you from

00:28.934 --> 00:30.456
behind. So I turned around, and I said, well, yes. 
And then I turned around, and we just kind of

00:34.662 --> 00:38.428
collided. That's our St. Arnold movie. Yes. That 
star that Mrs. Patman told me about that was on the

00:41.573 --> 00:47.882
way, you know, comes and hits you. Everybody has 
it. If you stand there, if you're in the right

00:50.386 --> 00:57.414
place, then it's... And you knew it when it 
happened, or you knew that something was... You

00:50.386 --> 00:57.414
knew something was happening. You knew 
something. You know something is happening.

01:00.458 --> 01:01.879
Uh-oh, the temperature goes up. Well, it wasn't a 
trip. It wasn't quite that straight. There were

01:09.588 --> 01:13.433
some... She had a boyfriend at the time. Nice 
evening dancing and everything. And... I know

01:19.462 --> 01:23.005
where it is. It's right across from the Holiday 
Inn. It's right by the Holiday Inn somewhere it

01:32.495 --> 01:36.439
sounds like. It's the Holiday Inn that was... I'm 
sorry, go ahead. Right. Yes.

01:51.753 --> 02:04.036
Right,

01:51.753 --> 02:04.036
get it up

01:51.753 --> 02:04.036
front. Yes. Mm-hmm. i think it was perfect one of 
each and it feels to me yes nice and neat yes not two

02:06.323 --> 02:32.263
and one yes one and one that's nice to that point who 
were at least my you know my age i was 39 when we met

02:06.323 --> 02:32.263
and didn't have any children he liked that idea and 
i can see why now of a family sort of all together

02:33.526 --> 03:01.390
ready-made not eight and one or something like 
that one

02:33.526 --> 03:01.390
of a kind so then um we were chased down uh bayshore 
by him no he chased him he chased you once You talk

03:01.657 --> 03:03.160
about excitement. How would you like to be chased 
by your girlfriend's boyfriend down Bayshore at

03:03.300 --> 03:12.656
60 miles an hour? What did he want to do, do you 
think? I don't know, but he was right behind us. He

03:16.523 --> 03:19.648
happened to run across you when he got angry that 
you were together? I couldn't believe it when I saw

03:19.932 --> 03:23.256
him in the rearview mirror. She saw him. I couldn't 
believe it. He turned off. He turned off. But, you

03:27.742 --> 03:30.345
know, I'd never been followed on the freeway. 
Except, I mean, I worried about it a lot, but I'd...

03:33.149 --> 03:33.990
Yes. But I'd never dreamed that it would be some... 
Sure, your girlfriend's boyfriend. Yeah. To get

03:39.437 --> 03:40.698
you into difficulty. Yeah. You know, of all... 
Having survived this long to be caught in this

03:41.700 --> 03:46.185
silly way. Yeah. This man is now an attorney in Los 
Angeles. I'm really freaking out when this book

03:50.814 --> 03:58.805
ever gets to Los Angeles. If it ever gets to Los 
Angeles, I got a call today from Palo Alto from

03:58.865 --> 04:04.853
somebody who needs help. It'll get it all over. 
Wouldn't that be nice? So, you know, the life was

04:09.779 --> 04:15.066
always exciting, you see. Not always, of course. 
You didn't tell about our honeymoon. Well, we had

04:22.050 --> 04:26.136
to kind of lay the foundations that we were getting 
married. But the anxiety part, again, the actual

04:26.717 --> 04:37.692
wedding and all that, we probably should talk 
about it also sometime. That was at Lake Tahoe.

04:38.813 --> 04:43.720
Lake Tahoe, because the assistant district 
attorney was my best man. That's tweaking the

04:43.885 --> 04:46.307
nose. Well, he was my best friend. One of my best 
friends. Wait, but how did you get a best friend who

04:51.393 --> 04:53.775
was an attorney assistant? He was a law student 
when I knew him. We played tennis. He loved to play

04:56.978 --> 04:58.720
with me, you know. He was not as good a player, so he 
always asked me to play. And he was the best looking

05:04.366 --> 05:06.749
guy that I knew. He was terribly handsome. 
Canadian. Oh, how nice. Very handsome guy, you

05:10.973 --> 05:12.535
know. Very handsome. Stop, stop. He had a dark 
mustache. Yeah. And so he was, I wanted him because

05:20.390 --> 05:24.676
he was, you know, my best friend. I had to get some 
kind of, establish some kind of, not only that, but

05:24.696 --> 05:33.048
who am I going to ask? Here's this guy, we're 
getting married, you know. Jesus, I know. George

05:39.136 --> 05:41.179
is up there now. Excuse me, I don't mean to 
interrupt, but Mackintosh actually stood up

05:41.935 --> 05:56.933
once, but George and his second wife came to the 
wedding. They were there. How long between the

05:59.896 --> 06:04.642
dance and Lake Tahoe? April to October. April to 
October. Before you get to the honeymoon scene,

06:08.986 --> 06:12.591
can I just tell one little anecdote? The honeymoon 
scene. Well, he's going to tell whatever it is. But

06:19.020 --> 06:25.470
to kind of illustrate how I regarded him at that 
period of time. As was said, I was into some other

06:26.151 --> 06:35.584
kind of relationship that was breaking up, and I 
was really having some security problems in many

06:26.151 --> 06:35.584
different ways. money, relationships, the kids, 
the whole thing. And to top it all off, my son, who

06:39.633 --> 07:02.807
had gone off with his father up to Montana on a 
fishing trip, up at Hungry Horse Dam, remote

06:39.633 --> 07:02.807
Montana, got a call in the middle of the night, Mark 
has penicillin, and I could envision, you know,

06:39.633 --> 07:02.807
which Indian doctors and TPs and all, he had to have 
immediate surgery, and just a whole lot of things

06:39.633 --> 07:02.807
were going on with that. I had to get on a plane, go to 
Montana, bring Mark back bent over with stitches

07:05.821 --> 07:11.832
on the Great Northern Railroad and all of this. 
This may come out later, but one of my typical

07:12.925 --> 07:22.221
behaviors is I spend all my money, and when I get to 
wherever I'm going, I always save enough for a

07:12.925 --> 07:22.221
telephone call. I got back to San Francisco 
Airport with Mark coming down the thing like this.

07:27.049 --> 07:30.294
I had, at that time, pretty important, 25 cents or 
whatever. 25 cents. 25 cents in my purse. And I had

07:33.540 --> 07:35.363
to make a choice. Am I going to call my friend in San 
Francisco to come and get me? Or am I going to call my

07:39.588 --> 07:45.597
new friend, who's been showing me a lot of nice 
thighs, to come and get me? And I opted to call Santa

07:45.617 --> 07:49.143
Fe. And we waited, Mark all bent over and me. And I 
remember him coming down. I could hear him coming.

07:59.319 --> 08:02.965
His heels were clicking on the concourse. And he 
had on that Tyrolean hat. Not my favorite. But here

08:08.225 --> 08:15.896
came this, in my mind's eye, he's always been to me a 
very substantial person.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.823
I'm not sure what that all has to do with this. I 
always wonder how he feels to me when I get married.

08:24.889 --> 08:36.365
But the fact that he came, you know, just like that, 
in my extremis, in my really dire need, I needed a

08:24.889 --> 08:36.365
substantial somebody there. And he took us home. 
And we weren't really all that close at that time.

08:44.980 --> 08:46.302
This is a man I can count on. It's a man I can rely on. I 
wanted people to need me and to get involved with

08:50.146 --> 08:54.991
people. So I felt great. When do you think that 
changed from the time when you didn't want to get

08:58.234 --> 09:04.141
involved with people and you left? That doesn't 
work. You have to... You cannot continue that

09:08.367 --> 09:10.690
forever. It's on the run and no relationships. 
When do you think that changed? As soon as I could.

09:19.682 --> 09:22.887
As soon as I was able to communicate. Because it 
wasn't me. That is not me. Was it only with Jean that

09:26.492 --> 09:29.155
it's changed or was it before? Well, it was Jean 
because it was... Because

09:31.942 --> 09:37.908
if it was threatening, naturally, then I would... 
But what I'm saying is, did this happen earlier

09:37.928 --> 09:40.910
somewhere? It was a slow, gradual thing, or 
somehow you found yourself enjoying being needed

09:40.950 --> 09:49.759
at this time?

09:53.402 --> 09:58.607
I would have preferred not to have to do the whole 
damn thing. and not to have to go through that.

10:02.119 --> 10:05.406
Well, how about in terms of, certainly it had to be 
gradual. You couldn't go from being an absolute

10:05.427 --> 10:10.638
loner to being really uncomfortable with people. 
But you had the first job as a dishwasher, you said.

10:16.189 --> 10:18.334
Did you establish a relationship there? So it was 
really from the library that you had them, because

10:18.787 --> 10:25.317
not too many questions were asked. You like to have 
at least contact and talk about it, or just say

10:26.378 --> 10:37.875
hello and talk about something and go your own way. 
But the longer you, these longer 24-hour kind of

10:38.581 --> 10:46.151
relationships are more difficult. There's so 
much time, and usually, then it goes, you know,

10:46.231 --> 10:57.846
school days, and that gets difficult. And I've 
never asked you any questions about WW2, because

10:57.866 --> 11:01.611
it gives me a big pain. She doesn't like WW2. Yeah, 
you were going to say? Yeah, I was just following on

11:05.885 --> 11:07.767
that still. So the Migrant Cruise, you said you had 
established some friendships as it were there

11:07.787 --> 11:16.138
with the family that was taking you in with the 
daughter and all. But you could disappear from

11:16.158 --> 11:17.801
those two. You'd have to take off. Well, was that 
the first real enduring friendships that took

11:18.922 --> 11:29.636
place in the Berkeley town? Berkeley? Oh, yes. I 
had lots of friends. I established a lot of... male

11:36.142 --> 11:39.308
friends and some girls dating. Was that the 
journey point or was it somewhere before that?

11:46.019 --> 11:49.846
Mostly at the university tennis courts. I think 
that's where the nucleus of some real meaningful

11:50.006 --> 11:55.276
relationship. That's where you met the Turk? The 
Turk, this fellow Lowell Welch. who was married

12:01.049 --> 12:06.877
and had two, what is it called? Three children with 
cerebral palsy. Oh, how tragic. Oh,

12:12.585 --> 12:20.555
that's tragic. Did you ever have any... What was 
the longest girlfriend you had? Or a long-term

12:25.722 --> 12:29.568
girlfriend?

12:29.588 --> 12:29.908
Oh... The Countess? The Countess was probably 
one. Then I knew her schoolteacher in Stockton,

12:36.918 --> 12:44.465
and she got mad at me because I went skiing instead 
of staying. Staying with her. Staying, you know.

12:46.527 --> 12:48.529
Gina, is this a tough subject for you? No. And I 
noticed, I went over my Social Security things,

12:48.849 --> 12:52.673
jobs. Most of the jobs are much shorter than I 
remember them.

13:01.529 --> 13:27.797
So I

13:01.529 --> 13:27.797
always had to, two or three months is all I could, 
because I would imagine that somebody was closing

13:01.529 --> 13:27.797
in on me somehow, because I'd probably done 
something, or they had checked my application,

13:01.529 --> 13:27.797
found that I didn't go to that school, and I was 
non-existent or whatever, but I had written down

13:01.529 --> 13:27.797
on these applications. Did you ever think, by the 
way, of getting real, graduating transcripts or

13:32.174 --> 13:35.781
certificates. These things can be arranged. You 
can get, I don't know

13:39.588 --> 13:54.435
whether you can get transcripts.

13:55.563 --> 14:01.133
Well,

13:55.563 --> 14:01.133
I didn't want to get involved in any 
manufacturing. That's reasonable. I've said the

14:02.255 --> 14:05.601
very same thing, not school teacher, but I've told 
her. It makes you safe.

14:19.576 --> 14:20.397
Where did we go? We had to go clear to Carson City. 
And I remember we drove from South Shore, Tahoe, to

14:21.700 --> 14:29.013
Carson City with absolutely no conversation. 
Neither one of us said a word. I was terrified.

14:30.756 --> 14:31.197
Absolutely terrified. He was terrified, and I was 
having anxiety attacks. But I knew I had to do it.

14:34.863 --> 14:40.533
It's like, you know, it's just the most 
contradictory feelings in the world. Why did you

14:40.613 --> 14:43.238
feel that you had to do it? This was your last 
chance. kind of, not just last, the chance, you

14:45.310 --> 14:49.216
know. This was the chance. The chance, yeah. If you 
were going just stable, a family. Yeah, and these

14:53.803 --> 15:03.177
things do not come along that many times in your 
life. So you must take them. But then, what am I

15:06.382 --> 15:08.345
doing? What am I doing to these people? You know, 
and the guilt comes in, you know. So you go between

15:14.791 --> 15:21.608
euphoria and guilt, up and down, up and down. You go 
crazy. You sit there, and you can't talk. So then we

15:25.277 --> 15:30.770
get to the front of the county clerk or whoever, and 
we're filling out these papers. And they ask the

15:30.871 --> 15:32.154
questions. Have you ever been there?

15:35.750 --> 15:44.405
Oh, I

15:35.750 --> 15:44.405
know now why I said that. People were getting 
suspicious of me because I had not been married. In

15:49.995 --> 15:51.337
California, that's a no-no. Oh, is that right? You 
see, you know, and believing into adapting to the

15:53.333 --> 15:57.558
culture I'm in. Yes. I simply, that's right. You 
had to invent a divorce. I had to invent a divorce to

16:01.062 --> 16:03.044
fit in. Sure, sure. Because then I was born. You 
have one, I have one. Sure, sure. Now we're going to

16:08.771 --> 16:09.872
have a divorce. Yes, I see. But did I say no when I was 
married? Yes, yes. And I ran into that, see. A

16:18.002 --> 16:19.524
little discrepancy. Oh, maybe he's nervous or 
whatever it is. And my place in that period of time

16:24.012 --> 16:35.349
was, well, all right, if that's what he said, then I 
never asked a question. I never even asked him. Why

16:36.771 --> 16:37.732
didn't you? He gave me a strange look. But she would 
call me on these things sometimes, but she would

16:39.635 --> 16:44.282
not. Continuously. I didn't pursue it. That's 
what made her so comfortable. Yes. That's what

16:48.929 --> 16:50.252
made it so comfortable. Yes, she would let me off 
the hook. It wasn't that she didn't catch me at it.

16:55.941 --> 16:58.765
And because that, of course, then she would have 
been dumb. She would have scared you off and hurt

17:00.568 --> 17:01.830
you. Yeah, well, I wouldn't have liked her if she 
was that dumb. But you see, he didn't catch me at a

17:04.695 --> 17:07.759
lot of things either. There's a quick pro quo here. 
Yes, yes.

17:13.945 --> 17:16.948
What would he have caught you in that? Well, I'm 
sure there was a lot of dishonesty on both sides of

17:16.968 --> 17:21.452
our relationship. As I indicated to you, I was 
coming out of another one. I wasn't totally ready

17:24.135 --> 17:26.517
for a new relationship. You didn't tell me we were 
going to be chased down Bayshore or something. In a

17:30.581 --> 17:32.523
convertible, yes. Like a movie, you know? 
Rockford on... Oh, yes. We were both in a high-risk

17:38.489 --> 17:42.433
group, I would say. and for the grace of God and all 
of the luck in the world, whatever it is. You see,

17:47.644 --> 17:49.686
there has to be something. Our basic goodness is 
shining through. There's no way you can sit down

17:50.868 --> 17:58.118
and tell you, people tell you you should do this and 
that. Forget that. Just wait for the stars already

17:59.159 --> 18:02.464
coming. Wait for that star. Believe in those 
things. The same story that you read in the

18:05.791 --> 18:07.813
foxhole? Right. Exactly. Okay, now I'm ready for 
you to tell about the beach at Lake Tahoe. Yeah,

18:13.680 --> 18:14.701
that's okay. So here it is, wedding night. We're 
right on the water of this gorgeous Lake Tahoe.

18:21.668 --> 18:22.769
What time was it? It was late October. Cold. Well, 
she didn't write that in a matter of opinion. She

18:31.699 --> 18:32.620
says... let's go down to the beach

18:33.865 --> 18:57.477
let's go down

18:33.865 --> 18:57.477
to the water

18:33.865 --> 18:57.477
one of those swims yes and i freaked out because you 
know what the neighbors call the cops. There's a

19:00.845 --> 19:03.107
couple of nude people running around. I'm sure 
there's an ordinance against nude swimming at

19:03.548 --> 19:08.192
Lake Tahoe. I was always very concerned with minor 
infractions, because I know that's how most guys

19:09.253 --> 19:14.298
get caught. Don't go over the speed limit. Don't do 
these things. Because they check you out, and then

19:19.323 --> 19:26.670
they find out that you're wanted in 48, 50 states.

19:29.148 --> 19:41.153
So she couldn't figure out why I all of a sudden, 
because she probably sensed that I wasn't really,

19:29.148 --> 19:41.153
I was not really against the whole idea somehow. 
And then I would pull back. No, I wouldn't say that

19:43.117 --> 19:45.321
now. And thereby created a confusion that lasted 
itself for a long time, a lot of years, having to do

19:49.820 --> 19:56.958
with spontaneity. It couldn't be. And if I had 
known at that time I mean, in retrospect, it's hard

20:05.058 --> 20:08.763
to say. I couldn't be spontaneous and take little 
risks like that. A little risk. I really think I

20:13.751 --> 20:19.739
could have handled it better, knowing at that time 
what the reason for this inhibition was. Because I

20:19.760 --> 20:22.524
could have talked my way out of it or whatever. But I 
didn't. And it was then like a... It interfered

20:27.591 --> 20:32.398
with our intimacy in many, many later ways. or this 
fear of being apprehended. That's caused

20:34.621 --> 20:35.262
problems. But if I had known at that point in time, I 
think I really . You couldn't understand why he

20:42.070 --> 20:50.700
could be spontaneous at one time and seemingly 
prudish or halting at another time. The

20:52.783 --> 21:01.373
inconsistencies of that kind of thing was what I 
intuitively knew to be true when you were in

20:52.783 --> 21:01.373
private. Yeah, and just in his other general 
behavior. Because I'm not a fearful person. So

21:08.780 --> 21:10.543
then I say, okay, all right, never mind that. Well, 
it should be, because that's what kept you safe, is

21:10.583 --> 21:15.932
that you were concerned. Let's just shove that 
down somewhere. So that's why I say, that's why I

21:20.239 --> 21:25.808
don't recommend that kind of lifestyle for... for 
anybody, you know. I was just stuck and I had to do

21:30.462 --> 21:32.164
it. Sure. But it's work that seems to have been 
exactly the right decision. You know, it's many

21:37.648 --> 21:42.032
compensation that evens itself out of it. Well, it 
sounds like you weren't giving up much to be, to

21:42.052 --> 21:49.098
get, you weren't giving up a freedom that you were 
utilizing. No, I felt the freedom, the freedom

21:49.198 --> 21:51.841
part I loved. But you, it sounds as though you have 
more freedom in a way now. lifestyle I had to

21:56.382 --> 21:59.406
change, you know, tremendously. But even that, 
there's nothing wrong with living with migrant

21:59.446 --> 22:08.898
workers and it's just a marvelous experience. But 
those days are gone. Hands on kind of thing and I

22:11.241 --> 22:20.213
know what I'm talking about and I wouldn't trade 
that for anything now, you know, to have done it.

22:20.699 --> 22:23.185
Because you can't do it, you have to do it when 
you're very young. Just like some of the younger

22:23.606 --> 22:30.261
students in the Kennedy years went off into Peace 
Corps kind of thing. Really, that's what it was.

22:31.785 --> 22:32.366
Idealism. Because idealism, you know, and I 
wasn't... To really know... what they're like,

22:38.873 --> 22:43.038
instead of just reading in magazines what they're 
like. How did you feel about me when I marched

22:43.379 --> 22:51.128
behind Linus Paul in the Peace Parade in Palo Alto 
in 1965? He was hanging back, worrying about

22:51.288 --> 22:59.278
whether or not I might attracts interest by the 
authorities? Well, yes. Okay. This gives me

23:06.930 --> 23:13.082
another connection of a friend of yours. That lady 
that you go to lunch with every once in a while in

23:13.973 --> 23:24.987
Honolulu that just resigned from the city 
council, that always says, it's just another

23:13.973 --> 23:24.987
test. You're just being tested. My wife is going 
down protesting, may be arrested. She wants me to

23:32.637 --> 23:34.299
go nude swimming. It's just another test. And 
that's really a good thing. All these things, you

23:42.728 --> 23:45.492
know, they throw these things at you. OK, here we go 
again. You think you get over these tests, but no,

23:47.415 --> 23:50.098
they want you dentists. What would you do if? Write 
down what would you do. And I'll give you another

23:54.925 --> 23:58.350
paper and tell you whether you're a dummy or not. 
Jesus Christ, not another test. All your life, you

24:01.594 --> 24:04.759
get test after test after test. Are you close? 
Pretty soon. Probably. You've eaten already, so

24:08.424 --> 24:11.368
you're OK. We're OK. Are you hungry? Actually, I'm 
not. Maybe you'd prefer to just go do what you want

24:16.169 --> 24:21.996
to do. Either if you're hungry, call us. I'll tell 
you what I'd like to do tomorrow.

24:30.406 --> 24:33.790
It would be reasonable that I could get employed in 
this. I am, frankly, looking for a job at this

24:34.091 --> 24:37.495
point. And I don't care. if it's in Colorado or 
Hawaii or Texas or New York City, where I need a job

24:39.226 --> 24:47.457
in the foreseeable future. Is there any way I 
could... I don't know. There's no money coming in

24:49.480 --> 24:50.561
yet. Yeah. Is there anything that I could 
legitimately call a job? Oh, I see. Against future

24:56.769 --> 24:58.532
earnings. Because it couldn't be now because 
there's no money coming in.

25:03.799 --> 25:08.625
Could we not put you on the payroll of the book so 
that when the book does come out... You can take a

25:09.044 --> 25:16.140
percentage as a researcher in the past or 
something

25:09.044 --> 25:16.140
like that. Let me toss that out. I don't know. I'd 
have to stop. Part of it is our kind of iffy

25:26.341 --> 25:50.762
situation i think we've indicated we're

25:26.341 --> 25:50.762
trying to get over here

25:26.341 --> 25:50.762
we really are and i spent most of the past week 
interviewing and sending resumes and a lot of

25:26.341 --> 25:50.762
stuff in colorado which may or may not turn out 
there's a very good job possibility Which pays

25:51.181 --> 25:55.887
very well, and I would take it if it comes by, but it 
may not. Kind of like to have a stepping stone back

25:55.907 --> 26:00.373
to the mainland. He's got to stay there because 
he's got the job. Right. So you would live in

26:04.979 --> 26:09.845
different places.

26:12.349 --> 26:13.510
Have you lived in the park before? Six months. Six 
weeks. Months. Weeks. Was it? Six weeks. Six

26:20.290 --> 26:21.351
months. Yeah, my time goes by what I feel. Sure. Oh, 
I see. I see. But I think throughout our marriage,

26:26.555 --> 26:34.362
we have had enough security about what we're 
doing. If I didn't

26:35.143 --> 26:40.908
go out, he'd be gone. Actually, it's kind of weird. 
Yeah, makes you need him. makes him need you more.

26:45.643 --> 26:46.844
No, he needs me. I need him. But he does a lot of 
things for himself that gives him pleasure to do.

26:52.290 --> 26:54.552
And he doesn't do it. What are some of those things? 
He wants to make salad. He's a great salad maker.

26:59.337 --> 27:01.599
When I'm there, I say, did you wash the tomato? She 
thought she would freak me out with these ideas of

27:02.380 --> 27:06.444
hers. Of course, I don't get freaked out very 
easily. You don't show it anyway. No, I don't show

27:10.028 --> 27:11.830
it. Like I said, and then I make some kind of a speech 
or some kind of thing. And I said, you know, it's

27:16.356 --> 27:25.106
just, she's just like a wild Mustang, you know, a 
beautiful horse, wild. And you just, when you

27:25.847 --> 27:38.082
break in a Mustang, you don't jump on it and start to 
ride it, you know, you let it run and run and run

27:25.847 --> 27:38.082
until it gets tired before you jump on it. I see. And 
she liked that. Sounds very much like the ring that

27:40.143 --> 27:42.206
you got from the arrow. I could kill myself for 
throwing it. Oh, no, no, no. You can get another

27:48.614 --> 27:49.736
one. You both have that same need to be... We can go 
probably to North Africa and get another one at any

27:49.756 --> 27:56.445
bazaar. I bet you they still make it. Maybe we won't 
have to do that. You might. I'd love to go back and

28:02.553 --> 28:05.497
find one just like it. Almost like it. But it had a 
was a Steinbach, and it's my sign, it turns out. My

28:10.429 --> 28:11.651
niece sent it to me. She sent me the Geburtstag book 
for your day, December 18th, the whole book. I have

28:21.920 --> 28:22.560
it here. And it's my Steinbach that is my sign. And 
it's a description in German of my type of person

28:29.046 --> 28:35.412
that I am, exactly. You get into that kind of stuff,

28:35.999 --> 28:41.973
you wonder. You really start to wonder. Just take 
it. Don't worry about it. Well, if I can think of a

28:47.947 --> 28:53.620
way to put you on the payroll somehow. The question 
is, though, are you asking for something right now

28:54.055 --> 29:04.491
that would just add to the resume for a link here, or 
are you asking for something that's a real

28:54.055 --> 29:04.491
honest-to-goodness job right now? Well, that 
won't be in the book, because there's no money

29:06.013 --> 29:08.397
coming in on the book yet. There won't be... But you 
mentioned it to be available for informational

29:10.100 --> 29:16.970
purposes. Oh, there's going to be many times that 
I'm going to have to call and say, I just don't know

29:17.010 --> 29:21.497
what... I would

29:21.646 --> 29:37.388
like to provide, would be, I would like to be the 
translator of the book into German. Into German?

29:39.311 --> 29:39.751
Into German. That's usually done by the way by the 
German publishers. They pay for the... I didn't

29:44.293 --> 29:46.496
translate any... That's what I was wondering. 
Well, I would, if there's any way... I would, yeah,

29:49.921 --> 29:53.266
I would like to reserve that. Because, of course, 
my German right now is not the world's greatest,

29:54.568 --> 30:00.237
you know. But my niece, Roswitha Bergman, is a 
major in German literature. And, you know, she

30:11.073 --> 30:15.780
would naturally, you know, she and I could 
collaborate. It's the best translation in the

30:15.801 --> 30:17.643
world. And I found out she's involved in a 
theatrical production right now. She dropped out

30:23.513 --> 30:24.875
of university. She has this thing about the 
theater. We can certainly offer that to the

30:31.373 --> 30:33.355
publisher. That's no problem. But usually it's 
done by, I didn't translate a word on that. I know

30:39.443 --> 30:41.446
you were surprised about the whole thing. That's 
why I brought it up, because I always believe in

30:41.506 --> 30:49.075
putting it out, you know, because people then say, 
well, you should have told me, you see? And so, you

30:50.397 --> 30:53.100
know, it's too late. It's too late. If you told me, 
it would have been great, yeah. So I'm putting it

30:57.074 --> 30:58.475
out. First of all, sometime and knowing whoever is 
in charge of my life is going to probably throw me

30:58.856 --> 31:09.848
back into it. And in six, eight months or less than 
that, I probably get it. And I really love my

31:17.316 --> 31:21.380
original language. It isn't that. I was quite good 
at it. We can certainly throw that in. And I'm very,

31:28.586 --> 31:30.048
very particular. I cannot, and I have a feeling for 
poetry in words that includes every P. Well, you

31:31.049 --> 31:42.043
have to be quite aware of words and nuances. Yes, I 
know when there are too many P's in there, I take it

31:42.063 --> 31:46.128
all out. I look at it as an artist. We can certainly 
throw that into it. Let me ask you about

31:52.475 --> 31:56.339
girlfriends once more. You were saying that I just 
need to pin it down. There were girlfriends along

32:03.688 --> 32:05.790
the way. Except I couldn't form any lasting 
relationships because, although I probably

32:07.152 --> 32:19.365
wanted to many times, because they want to know 
everything about you. Right. Where is your

32:20.521 --> 32:21.482
father? Where are they living? What did he do for a 
living? What school did you go to? What did you

32:25.205 --> 32:27.347
major in? Yes. And I don't know any of these. And I 
didn't want to manufacture too much. First of all,

32:34.694 --> 32:37.317
you get caught. I'd rather say, OK. So I'd just say, 
OK. What was the longest relationship you had,

32:40.300 --> 32:49.268
let's say?

32:49.288 --> 32:50.089
A couple of months, two or three months. And to get 
serious, some of them even, maybe they weren't the

32:50.710 --> 32:56.836
question, maybe they just wanted to get married. 
And that would scare me.

33:01.842 --> 33:09.830
A variety of things, because maybe I liked him 
enough, but it wasn't the comment, the star. It had

33:12.293 --> 33:13.074
to be the star. Anybody serious that you would 
think back on? Oh yes, yes, yes, I have a few

33:17.828 --> 33:21.774
questions. Yeah, there was this one girl, I was ski 
instructor at Sugar Bowl. At where? At Sugar Bowl.

33:30.468 --> 33:31.570
Sugar Bowl. And she kind of, as my boss Bill Klein 
pointed out to me, when he called me into a private

33:32.672 --> 33:42.908
company, Dennis, I want you to discontinue that 
relationship. Because my instructors do not get

33:46.892 --> 33:50.956
involved with their students. And because you're 
not going to be happy. It's not going to work out, I

33:55.400 --> 33:58.884
can tell you that. You've got to go out and earn your 
own living and not marry just some gal or anybody

33:58.904 --> 34:08.594
that comes along in this business. Because girls 
fall in love with ski instructors, et cetera, et

34:08.614 --> 34:12.017
cetera. Of course, he didn't point out that his 
predecessor, the one that formed this whole sugar

34:12.723 --> 34:29.564
bowl, married 55 million railroad, the Union 
Railroad, lived happily ever after. He forgot to

34:29.885 --> 34:32.088
mention that. But anyway. It was pretty 
paternalistic. He really took a fondly interest

34:34.631 --> 34:37.975
in what his instructor said. He felt I was going to 
get into trouble with this girl. Who was a... real

34:42.760 --> 34:52.100
charming, you know, the California type girl, 
very charming, big smile all the time, big

34:42.760 --> 34:52.100
California smile, very bright, you know. She was 
an advertising manager for a shopping center in

34:52.741 --> 34:57.351
Sacramento. That shopping center in those girl's 
days was the big, you know, nobody ever heard of

35:01.036 --> 35:04.744
him. This guy she worked for was a pioneer in this 
and she was writing columns in the paper. So, you

35:11.438 --> 35:14.705
know, you're talking about a very bright girl. And 
from an ordinary Sacramento family. So that was

35:22.737 --> 35:25.240
the first kind of relationship. But I had no way of 
sustaining it because I had no job. Once the season

35:28.744 --> 35:33.150
was over, where would I go? I'd have to go back and 
maybe pick peaches or cherries, whatever was in

35:33.230 --> 35:41.320
season. About what years were these? This is 50? 
Probably 50. 49,

35:47.067 --> 35:50.972
maybe. I mean, I hadn't been out for very long. 
Yeah, so really years went by without a long

35:53.588 --> 35:56.471
relationship. Yeah. What did you do for friends or 
for companions?

36:07.425 --> 36:08.567
I didn't really need any. I didn't really want any. 
I think there were so many impacts on my life. The

36:15.656 --> 36:20.402
land, just as an observer to... to go silently 
through the land and see it, and watch the people.

36:29.621 --> 36:34.830
If you're a people watcher, I'm a people watcher.

36:35.270 --> 36:38.675
And I would walk for miles and miles, a tire myself 
out. I mean miles. Like 50. 50 miles. Through Los

36:44.845 --> 36:46.828
Angeles. 12 o'clock at night until I was dead bone 
tired.

36:54.556 --> 36:58.840
But nothing is dull about walking through these 
cities. You lived in a rooming house or you lived in

37:00.082 --> 37:06.328
a- Some little hotel, whatever it was, rooming 
house. Then later on, I would live in, there were

37:07.330 --> 37:15.178
some rooming houses that were very comfortable 
with these charming ladies that run these One was

37:15.867 --> 37:18.751
in Stockton. Her name was Tisha Cochran. She was 
from Texas. I mean, they take you in like a

37:23.116 --> 37:27.862
combination mother and girlfriend. They worry 
about your job. They try to get you jobs. Why don't

37:33.350 --> 37:34.251
you become a... I know somebody who is a sheet metal 
worker. Why don't you join the union? And that kind

37:40.939 --> 37:42.501
of thing. They try to help you. They want you, you 
know, why do you live alone? Why don't you get

37:47.253 --> 37:48.355
married? They mother you. They worry about you. 
They found that place in Stockton, to Chicago. So

37:57.330 --> 38:01.858
you wouldn't get the whole thing, but, you know, 
that was enough. You can live on that, barely, you

38:02.760 --> 38:05.905
know. That somebody cares and you talk about it. 
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Be nice to join a union and

38:10.006 --> 38:15.395
become a cheap metal worker and make $200 a week. 
Sounds kind of lonely. Hmm? Sounds kind of lonely.

38:21.165 --> 38:21.746
Oh, it is. That's what I say. I don't recommend it. I 
do not recommend it.

38:31.061 --> 38:31.202
At all. But it beats... Slave labor camp in Russia. 
No question about that. No question about that. As

38:36.076 --> 38:40.962
soon as you bring this up, OK, then what's the 
alternative, you see? Yes. You see? Fine. Never

38:44.906 --> 38:46.829
any doubt, you see? How did you find the job in 
Clinton's? Clinton's? Probably had a sign in the

38:50.012 --> 38:51.494
window. And I looked it up. It wasn't all that long. 
I only made $250. I thought I'd been there six

38:56.800 --> 38:59.443
months. But the impression was very strong. at 
Clinton's. Why?

39:08.701 --> 39:12.707
The place was huge. Hundreds of people. And a 
tremendous amount

39:13.128 --> 39:17.394
of food. Something that most people have never 
seen in their lives,

39:17.414 --> 39:25.787
so much food and so many people. Noise and . in a cave 
downstairs in the basement. I don't know, it just,

39:32.299 --> 39:39.531
it had something about the caveman type thing, who 
knows, you know, that instinct. But then also it

39:39.651 --> 39:42.877
frightened me because you can't get out. And 
that's another story because I had once, I could

39:43.077 --> 39:51.812
not ever be in a place that didn't have at least two 
exits.

39:54.003 --> 40:08.141
A friend of mine, another colleague,

39:54.003 --> 40:08.141
ski instructor, who took like me, and I liked him, 
couldn't help like him. He could play the guitar,

40:08.161 --> 40:19.015
yodel even, but he was a westerner, a real good 
westerner, American through and through. He

40:19.518 --> 40:22.661
helped me with a summer job. He says, Dennis, I 
think I can get you the pro job at the Awani Hotel in

40:22.681 --> 40:28.408
Yosemite.

40:31.251 --> 40:32.052
Well, what year was this?

40:36.356 --> 40:37.598
I think it was 1949. Very early. I had a speech 
problem. I couldn't talk that well. Well, I talked

40:46.822 --> 40:49.466
well enough that I could teach skiing. Nobody 
bothered me. I was in my element. And probably the

40:53.711 --> 40:56.615
students didn't mind my accent. They didn't 
question. They didn't go in and say, hey, who'd you

40:57.456 --> 41:00.981
get there for a ski instructor? I knew my business. 
They became good skiers. They loved me. So that

41:05.927 --> 41:09.552
question never came up. But then you'd get thrown 
into other environments. You have to learn a new

41:14.935 --> 41:18.980
jargon and a new background. And

41:19.060 --> 41:25.288
I backed up, you see. Pardon? OK. So he says, go in 
there. You got the job. Report. You got the job. I

41:35.762 --> 41:40.908
drove in to Yosemite, which, of course, is one of 
the most beautiful places. First of all, you're

41:41.209 --> 41:43.812
overwhelmed by the nature. 1,000, 1,500 feet of 
rocks on all sides, 1,700 feet waterfalls coming

41:45.040 --> 41:52.366
down. At night, they go up at the top of 1,700 feet 
and they build huge fireplaces and kick the

41:53.727 --> 42:05.197
timbers down and they fall down 1,700 feet. They 
play the guitar over fireplaces. I mean, the whole

42:08.340 --> 42:11.523
thing. You were Dennis at the time or Peter 
Pearson? I must have been Dennis already. I didn't

42:17.743 --> 42:19.687
have to switch after that. That was about 49 or 50. 
49 or 50. I just barely got into the dance. And they

42:27.601 --> 42:34.012
weren't quite open about a week away from opening 
for the season. And they just gave me a place to

42:34.032 --> 42:37.879
sleep and just wait until the opening. And a couple 
of nights went by, and I looked at those rocks, and

42:39.175 --> 42:47.565
there's only one way out of this place, Yosemite 
Belt. It's a dead end street, see? 2,000 feet high,

42:49.527 --> 42:54.673
all the way around. And a storm came up,

42:54.693 --> 43:00.661
lightning. And I got in the car, and I went out, 
drove in that lightning.

43:08.048 --> 43:10.932
I mean, complete, I just left. I don't know what 
that guy ever thought of me. I let him down, you

43:16.099 --> 43:19.964
know, ran out of a job. Years later, I was talking 
about it, relating that same story. Why didn't you

43:24.770 --> 43:26.393
leave that job? Who were you talking to? Oh, some 
co-worker. I was working, I think, at Capwell's,

43:29.957 --> 43:34.984
window decorator or something, and I said, 
relating that story. You have to tell a story

43:36.929 --> 43:38.311
sometimes. You can't just sit there like on a 
stump. So whatever comes to my mind that you want to

43:41.816 --> 43:49.226
tell, you tell. And this guy said, you know, my wife 
can't stand Yosemite. She gets claustrophobia.

43:55.415 --> 44:00.302
And I looked at him and said, that's exactly what I 
had. Because I could never understand my own

44:00.322 --> 44:02.625
behavior. I could not, I cannot be in this 
beautiful, gigantic cave. I left it and hurt my

44:11.221 --> 44:14.925
best friend's feelings.

44:17.348 --> 44:18.169
And you saw him again. I don't think I did. He got me 
another job. He could have gotten, he said, I can

44:23.134 --> 44:25.077
get you a job. I can get you to the National Forest 
and to the Forest Service. He was a forest ranger.

44:30.415 --> 44:36.905
Have

44:30.415 --> 44:36.905
you met these people? I had jobs. I could have been 
in all kinds of things.

44:46.339 --> 44:48.402
He was in Bryce Canyon. He married a girl who liked 
me very much. But, you know, I just, and anyway,

44:58.664 --> 45:03.433
they got married and they were happy. They had six 
children, lived happily forever after. And they

45:07.981 --> 45:10.246
both, you know, liked me very much. They wanted me 
to join the Forest Service, got me, tried to get me

45:10.286 --> 45:16.437
jobs. Whatever I wanted, you know, what can't we 
help you, Dennis?

45:22.087 --> 45:24.249
Are you still friends, or you haven't seen these 
people in some years? He named his first son after

45:24.310 --> 45:26.051
me. He's named Dennis. I'm his godfather. I'm the 
godfather. How nice. Send me pictures for a while.

45:34.041 --> 45:34.902
What a nice thing. I feel guilty. Why? Because I'm 
not a good godfather. I don't send him any birthday

45:38.426 --> 45:45.113
cards and things like that. I feel terrible. Why 
don't you? I don't know. Well, I just don't know.

45:50.627 --> 45:54.591
It's just... You know, you could send these things 
without ever revealing anything. Oh. Marriage is

45:59.276 --> 46:00.838
so time-consuming. Marriage is time-consuming, 
and I don't know what happens. A strange thing

46:05.924 --> 46:07.125
happens. A guilt thing happens. Because you 
didn't let him down?
