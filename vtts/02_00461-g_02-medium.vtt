WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:14.481
And they had, of course, their own curriculum and 
something else again.

00:14.501 --> 00:17.845
So I got all kinds of education, but it never fit 
into my . So I'd say, actually, probably grade one

00:17.865 --> 00:30.039
below the top, which is the . I'd say . But you 
thought he could have helped more. And

00:32.887 --> 00:46.185
he's not political. He's not... No, I don't think 
he would have time to go to any meetings that I know

00:47.332 --> 00:55.942
of, because it was odd hours. Or had to join some 
sort of... He might have. He might have had to join

00:58.765 --> 01:02.969
it. But like you say, you know, you pay the first 
month's dues and you pay the next, you know, that

01:02.989 --> 01:09.336
kind of thing. Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I'm not making 
any of that up. But there wasn't a... picture of

01:13.218 --> 01:19.288
Hindenburg on the wall, or there was a picture of 
Hitler on the wall, or there was a picture of

01:13.218 --> 01:19.288
something. I'm just trying to gauge your level

01:19.308 --> 01:24.817
of... There might have been a picture of 
Hindenburg on the wall. Most families did. My

01:28.904 --> 01:32.951
parents had a picture of Franz Joseph on the wall. 
And that influenced the way I feel about things.

01:39.762 --> 01:58.370
Okay, I see the capture, I see the routine shift 
across North Africa, the big camps, the bigger and

01:39.762 --> 01:58.370
bigger holding camps, and your experience with 
the black GIs, and the difference in treatment

01:39.762 --> 01:58.370
between how the British handled you and how the 
U.S. troops handled you. I don't get any feeling

01:59.312 --> 02:03.138
for searches, endless searches or endless... 
Yes. Yeah, I just didn't... To me, that's their

02:07.083 --> 02:09.146
right. It's a drag. We had them. But I wasn't upset 
by it too much. We couldn't figure out what the

02:16.757 --> 02:18.460
hell. They don't throw you somewhere else for 
that. They were the constant searches. And

02:23.046 --> 02:26.511
especially toward the end, they searched the camp 
all the time. And we had to stay between those two

02:26.551 --> 02:28.735
fences. And the orders were not to touch the 
fences. So we had 500 people in this area. And they

02:35.720 --> 02:40.667
guard staring at you and daring you to touch the 
fence and that kind of thing. But my way of handling

02:40.687 --> 02:54.869
these kind of situations is, you know, I'm in this, 
I don't make any, I just, to me, that's the time to

02:40.687 --> 02:54.869
keep your mouth shut and just do that. Sure. So I 
don't get into any hassles. It's not my style. So

03:01.238 --> 03:04.343
you went to larger camps and then you were 
eventually put on ships and sent to the US, and then

03:04.829 --> 03:12.917
put on trains, and then you started to feed into the 
camp system. Which I knew nothing about, because I

03:13.758 --> 03:19.563
had no idea that there were that many in three or 
four camps. Yeah. And you didn't sidle up to make a

03:20.544 --> 03:26.109
close chum that you went through these 
experiences with?

03:29.833 --> 03:30.674
No. I always had friends.

03:34.563 --> 03:41.093
But I never, this real closeness that I couldn't 
live without him, I really never got. That kind of

03:42.655 --> 03:44.999
chumminess. But lots of friends. I can go almost 
anywhere and immediately have somebody I like in

03:46.280 --> 03:52.770
response to me. And we have a gay old time while 
we're there, whatever we're doing. But you

03:56.255 --> 04:04.047
weren't paired up with somebody or two or three 
guys you used to meet every now and again in a

03:56.255 --> 04:04.047
different camp somewhere and say, oh, I haven't 
seen you in a long time. How was life in treating

04:04.550 --> 04:05.772
you? Cold running into him. It may have happened 
that way. But there again, it wasn't that close. It

04:13.001 --> 04:17.727
was just nice to see a familiar face and say hi or 
hi-o. Or hi-o, right. And it may have happened that

04:20.670 --> 04:22.933
way. You can say there was a lot of good 
comradeship. that i enjoyed so i was not isolated

04:31.263 --> 04:59.042
by my own peers and i had a lot of friends and we had a 
long barrack you know maybe 40 50 guys in there and

04:31.263 --> 04:59.042
you gravitated to your little group make it hey can 
i get close there right because they like to talk to

04:31.263 --> 04:59.042
them better rather than the old grouch down there 
right upper bunk or lower bunk I

04:59.377 --> 05:26.140
believe in the first camp, we only had one . . . . . . .

05:29.549 --> 05:32.515
There was no one directly from Schweitzer's head. 
My unit, in fact, I think, was mentioned.

05:38.866 --> 05:42.553
I got thrown into the Schwab's and the Saxon's. I 
came from Prussia .

05:48.145 --> 05:52.652
So I was always in a different environment. There 
was no one from my hometown. That might have made a

05:56.277 --> 05:59.782
difference, but I didn't. I was lucky to be 
accepted because the Prussians, even in Germany,

06:00.363 --> 06:12.921
are not that popular because they're a little more 
uptight. more severe climate than the West

06:13.390 --> 06:17.236
Germans. And the Southern Germans are much more 
gregarious. The Schwaben, they have their

06:20.320 --> 06:23.144
dialect. And the Saxons have their dialect like 
the Southern guys here. Or in the old days, Arkes

06:27.170 --> 06:30.375
and Oakies. Yes. And so to be accepted in these more 
gregarious was due to my own gregariousness, I

06:42.888 --> 06:47.595
think, and not be an outcast. I was not made an 
outcast. No, no, I never imagined that you would

06:48.957 --> 06:53.924
have been an outcast. I think that, if anything, 
you're isolating yourself. I don't think that

06:56.307 --> 06:58.931
they were isolating you. Did you find yourself a 
minority, being Catholic, in a Protestant area?

07:07.745 --> 07:10.751
It seemed like it was always 50. It was always 
Catholicism. It was always pretty much 46. But you

07:18.347 --> 07:24.580
didn't feel any animosity because of being 
Catholic? No religious strife that I can think of.

07:27.556 --> 07:32.703
Did you expect, even after you were captured, that 
Germany was likely to win the war? Did you think it

07:32.723 --> 07:51.927
was going to be, well, you know, when you were first 
captured, was there a sense that I have to wait it

07:32.723 --> 07:51.927
out until... Well, I thought they had something, 
they had a plan of, you know, after all, they're

07:32.723 --> 07:51.927
going to be, call themselves field marshals and 
give themselves titles, and I thought they knew

07:32.723 --> 07:51.927
what they were doing, but... They had some kind of 
an overall plan. Did you have any sense of time of

07:57.923 --> 08:06.696
how long you were likely to be in the camps, or did 
you just level out mentally and not think about the

07:57.923 --> 08:06.696
future? Yeah, I probably had, having had quite a 
bit of history in school, I didn't worry about the

08:06.716 --> 08:19.635
length of these things because we had as long in 
history as long wars before. And, you know, we had a

08:20.510 --> 08:30.944
four-year war, and WWI, and a three-year war, and a 
seven-year war that was a hundred-year war. So I

08:31.645 --> 08:33.728
was quite concerned. And by that time, I really, 
that was one of the reasons probably that

08:33.748 --> 08:38.955
contributed to my escape. I really had given up on 
any time, right, on any, in my lifetime. You know,

08:47.567 --> 08:50.010
because a hundred years, you got, you know, So I 
just thought, I'll just do whatever I have to do. I

08:56.606 --> 09:00.430
have to manufacture cigarette cases. And 
schnitzel, that's called schnitzel. I saw it in a

09:05.614 --> 09:07.036
book the other day. It was quite an art in those 
days. Not that I had taken it in school or anything,

09:11.760 --> 09:19.727
but all the churches had these wood carvings that 
were just literally every wall, everything full

09:20.872 --> 09:30.336
of wood carvings that I had seen, not necessarily 
done. So when I had the time and somebody, I could

09:30.356 --> 09:36.130
get a piece of wood and a knife, I would do 
something, because I'd seen so much around me. I

09:40.201 --> 09:43.727
was surrounded by this kind of artwork. Could you 
easily get knives, or was there a concern that

09:43.747 --> 09:48.554
these would be used as weapons? They were very easy 
to find. They were short knives. And in the

09:54.564 --> 10:04.800
beginning, for most of the time, we had almost an 
understanding between the guards And the

10:04.932 --> 10:08.396
prisoners, there was nothing we could do. I mean, 
come on, where are we going to go? That type of

10:13.021 --> 10:14.282
thing. Miles from home. Yeah. And the realistic 
approach, we're not going to try this blowing up of

10:19.347 --> 10:27.035
railroad things. It wouldn't have made a damn bit 
of difference. It might make a good story, and then

10:34.058 --> 10:35.601
But not where we were. And where would you blow up? 
The desert? And they couldn't care less. And you

10:43.057 --> 10:46.785
got a few letters from these two girls. while you 
were in the camp, were those about the only people

10:48.183 --> 10:53.488
who wrote, or were there other people as well? Oh, 
other people as well. I probably kept trying to

10:55.089 --> 10:57.531
keep in touch. I was a fairly good writer in those 
days, I mean, active, and tried to keep my friends,

10:57.551 --> 11:09.542
I wanted to keep my friends in touch.

11:09.562 --> 11:17.869
But I don't really, per se, recall them except 
those two girls that I wrote to, Maria, and I think

11:09.562 --> 11:17.869
if I wrote to any third ones. But I used to, I would 
meet girls skiing, like I'd go skiing by myself,

11:17.849 --> 11:27.578
and you'd meet these local girls, like in the 
Riesentuberg, in the Czechoslovakian border.

11:30.521 --> 11:35.946
I would meet some girls that live nearby, come 
skiing, and stops right next to me. So you'd meet

11:35.966 --> 11:43.133
all kinds of girls, and sometimes you'd ask them 
for their name and address, and I'd write to you,

11:35.966 --> 11:43.133
and things like that. So I had a lot of contacts. And 
by that time, like I say, most of my male friends had

11:45.760 --> 11:48.764
gone. I was one of the last ones to leave the, to 
enter the services. They had already gone. And I

11:56.893 --> 11:58.415
will say a little episode. I remember after they 
had to, it's in there when the law, there was a law

11:58.475 --> 12:05.944
passed, the expulsion of the Jewish people. I 
didn't know there was a law passed for it. It's

12:08.988 --> 12:11.751
right in here. The year after, or very shortly 
thereafter, I went back to the recently working.

12:30.068 --> 12:31.670
It's in here. There was a law passed, you know, and I 
went back. I said, I was skiing all along, I said,

12:37.887 --> 12:41.251
what is the matter with these lodgers? It's just, 
everything is so dead. Nobody to ski with, nobody

12:44.034 --> 12:47.998
to talk to, just the people that run the lodge. And 
everybody getting really grim, you know. Of

12:51.662 --> 12:53.964
course, they had no business, you know. You can 
imagine, your resort is falling, you know, no more

12:53.984 --> 12:58.289
income for them. I didn't think in those business 
terms, but I thought at the time that there were a

12:58.409 --> 13:07.118
lot of Jewish people going skiing, and You know, 
the fun, the laughing. Maybe because I associated

13:10.135 --> 13:13.838
with the people leaving, you see. Where's all the 
people? You know, we had much more fun. Is this the

13:19.163 --> 13:20.824
way it's going to be? You know, kind of a drag. I 
remember that kind of crossing my mind briefly.

13:27.470 --> 13:30.433
You think it was because of the law of expelling the 
Jews? Yeah, that's what I thought, you know.

13:32.815 --> 13:34.296
Because where's everybody gone? You know, that 
kind of stuff. So the

13:37.540 --> 13:57.025
people you wrote to, you wrote to everybody at 
home. You wrote to your folks. You could keep in

13:59.008 --> 14:00.509
contact with. Yes. And the people who generally 
wrote back to you were these two girls, your

14:00.850 --> 14:04.795
parents, of course. Yes. Your brother Paul? No. Or 
Lottie? Lottie might have made a footnote or

14:13.373 --> 14:15.295
something. I don't think she wrote her separate 
letters. We weren't on that boat. But always a

14:19.460 --> 14:22.363
little note stuck with it. Did they tell you about 
conditions at home, or it was just more chatty

14:23.665 --> 14:26.949
news? No, just chatty news. They didn't say things 
are going grim here? No. Uncle so-and-so is eating

14:34.122 --> 14:39.574
the grapes and we've been reduced to nothing like 
that. It's nothing that... I'm trying to find out

14:40.616 --> 14:47.752
how high your morale is in the camp and how isolated 
you are from events that are taking place.

14:51.100 --> 14:51.220
I see. I would say pretty isolated. Maybe not me so 
much, but the rest of them that couldn't read as

14:54.633 --> 14:59.139
well. Since you got the American newspaper. Yeah, 
because I got the American newspaper. I got to read

15:04.026 --> 15:07.291
all the color stories. So you're building up an 
impression of how bad things are at home. You're

15:12.659 --> 15:15.503
not getting it so much from letters from your 
family. But you're reading the newspaper, among

15:15.770 --> 15:25.503
the few people who are, and you're building up a 
pretty grim feeling about what home is going to be

15:15.770 --> 15:25.503
like when you get back. So when the final thing 
comes, that this is now falling into the Soviet

15:26.565 --> 15:32.773
zone, which it did, you weren't wrong. You don't 
see much of an attraction there. The letters are

15:36.278 --> 15:42.586
not that encouraging from your folks or from the 
lobby. There isn't that much family connection.

15:44.457 --> 15:46.166
that you really... The last I remember was the 
Spears fighting. I kept looking for the old man's

15:49.061 --> 15:52.358
name. And the closest was the coal mines in Upper 
Silesia, which was very close. And the fierce

15:59.871 --> 16:02.334
fighting that took place. And the civilians that 
were fighting, they were fighting for their

16:02.354 --> 16:05.917
families. There were really horror stories of 
them fighting. And then between civilians and

16:10.001 --> 16:20.590
soldiers,

16:10.001 --> 16:20.590
which was unknown to me. And the casualties, as 
we're always reporting.

16:27.004 --> 16:28.892
Could I interject something here?

16:33.091 --> 16:44.331
Could

16:33.091 --> 16:44.331
you talk a little longer? I was looking

16:44.591 --> 16:55.470
for my town on maps and I could never find it. So one 
of the first things that I did was to go to the

16:55.450 --> 17:05.685
library, and I got out every possible thing I could 
get, books, maps, everything. In Waianae, Makah.

17:06.787 --> 17:10.873
This town, one of the Polish ones with all the new 
names. And he was frantic. He was searching and

17:12.015 --> 17:17.623
searching this little library out in Waianae, 
Waianae. And he found it in one of the maps. It has no

17:20.127 --> 17:21.850
sweet nidsets. Sweet nidsets, yeah. You almost 
embraced that now. Well, I thought that a lot of

17:28.615 --> 17:31.582
these towns were leveled. So you had looked in 
libraries previously over the years. Over the

17:36.673 --> 17:38.096
years you had? Yeah. I kept looking for that all the 
time, what ever happened. Part of it was my

17:42.498 --> 17:48.586
anxiety, because I was always afraid to look. It 
was that fear of what you might find. So I was not a

17:51.710 --> 17:53.012
good looker. She can calmly look. I was too excited 
to look. If you get too excited, you can't find

17:58.859 --> 18:02.044
anything. Would you have looked while you were 
working in Clinton's cafeteria, wandering into a

18:05.212 --> 18:11.019
library, or would you have... Not in those days. 
Later on, I'd say, after I had a... Well, I would

18:11.880 --> 18:20.430
read the papers all the time. I'm trying to think 
when I look. And they would have maps in the paper,

18:22.953 --> 18:27.338
and that town was never in it. Berkeley sounds like 
a likely place, too. Would that be a place that you

18:31.003 --> 18:34.286
would be using the university library? I was not 
that courageous to use these facilities. I wished

18:39.632 --> 18:43.456
I could have. I was afraid to ask directions. I was 
too, you know, I wished I could have. I'd love to

18:48.621 --> 18:55.468
have gone to Berkeley to school, but I just simply 
was afraid because I never get close to

18:55.972 --> 19:04.688
authorities of any kind, county, city, county, 
state, federal. I stay away from all the

19:05.128 --> 19:08.254
authoritative type. And even to this day, Gene 
knows that. I just hate it. So I'm afraid that I have

19:14.445 --> 19:20.055
to fill out forms and ask questions that I can't 
answer. I wanted to back up to fill in one gap in the

19:21.267 --> 19:26.331
escape itself. I realized when we were through 
this that you never talked about food. I got the

19:30.455 --> 19:40.504
sense of fear, the disappearance of the long run 
and the ride on the train and getting off the train

19:30.455 --> 19:40.504
and looking around, getting back on the train when 
the women looked at you and pointed. Can you

19:40.984 --> 19:45.669
remember how you ate, when you ate, when did you 
realize you needed to eat? I asked you the same

19:46.930 --> 19:47.710
thing. You know, I wished I could remember. I wish I 
wished. The thing that I remember closely is that

19:53.066 --> 19:59.852
there was a huge rock in my stomach. If you'd 
offered me that meal that we had last night, I doubt

20:02.214 --> 20:08.580
if I could have eaten it. And I probably was about 20 
or 30 pounds underweight. I think you live on

20:13.724 --> 20:18.008
starvation or something. I don't know how you 
survive. But some, I'm sure, strangers offered me

20:20.853 --> 20:25.577
food. And I'm sure I tried to get it, but I did not 
steal any. I may have, let's see, in the desert

20:31.622 --> 20:45.094
where I was, the first 500 miles, there was nothing 
there to steal because there's no farms of any

20:31.622 --> 20:45.094
kind. Eating a cactus. Eating a cactus. So it 
couldn't have been that. And I think the first...

20:50.536 --> 20:52.338
chance I had, I became a dishwasher. When I saw the 
sign in the window, I simply became a dishwasher.

20:55.541 --> 20:57.022
When you got to your first meeting. Maybe just 
didn't eat, direct some water somewhere. Yeah,

21:00.165 --> 21:06.231
direct maybe an orange or something, a fruit, or 
whatever. But the first few days, just during the

21:06.491 --> 21:10.095
first 24 hours, 48 hours. I doubt it, 48 hours. 72 
hours. I don't think I could have held any food. Did

21:14.679 --> 21:20.104
you meet any hobos at

21:14.679 --> 21:20.104
that particular point? Probably when the train 
stopped, there were men jumping out of it. We would

21:26.553 --> 21:36.003
go down the train and there would be men jumping 
out, but you always had to be careful because they

21:26.553 --> 21:36.003
were immediately warned that there were going to 
be railroad digs. I was immediately taught by

21:36.023 --> 21:44.252
these older men, like the older monkeys teaching 
the younger monkeys. Be careful, the railroad

21:44.603 --> 21:51.013
guys are going to arrest you if you don't show 
yourself to open the gate. Is that why when you said

21:51.033 --> 21:57.283
that you'd see some of the hobos jumping off out in 
the boonies, they would choose places? Yeah,

21:57.303 --> 22:01.390
before they arrive at the yard, you must get off. 
Not wait because they search the train when you

22:01.971 --> 22:04.895
pull in. You have to get off outside of town and jump 
on outside of town. But something

22:10.186 --> 22:30.430
else that we talked about in California,

22:10.186 --> 22:30.430
how our

22:10.186 --> 22:30.430
paths were kind of parallel. We don't know if they 
ever converged or not. And I remember in what had

22:31.351 --> 22:33.173
been a long about probably March or April of 1948 in 
California, As part of my territory,

22:33.153 --> 22:41.563
I went to hobo camps along the Korea River. Which 
river? To interview people in hobo camps. So I

22:47.330 --> 22:47.650
don't know. I haven't seen firsthand what a hobo 
camp looks like. I wonder. Yeah, there's a little

22:51.675 --> 22:56.000
tin can with a coffee or the beans. It's always on 
the fire. So if you stumbled upon a hobo camp,

23:02.347 --> 23:09.943
First, they just follow these guys, and they go to 
the next camp, and there'd be a pot of beans on a cup

23:02.347 --> 23:09.943
of coffee or something. Enough to sustain you. 
Enough to sustain you, they would give you. But you

23:16.055 --> 23:17.318
did this life only for A year or two? Oh, less than 
that. Probably just a few months until you get the

23:20.258 --> 23:24.643
first dishwasher job. And then you get three 
square meals a day almost, you see. And then you get

23:30.209 --> 23:31.791
a few meals ahead. Yes. And save a few bucks in 
whatever plan or ferments in your brain where you

23:33.914 --> 23:42.143
want to go. And that would have happened. That 
would have taken place. After the few months, then

23:44.956 --> 24:03.583
one season with the Arkansas family up to Medford, 
then the log cutting, the calf incident with the

23:44.956 --> 24:03.583
splitter, down to the Mexican border, saw the 
darkness on the other side, and realized that the

23:44.956 --> 24:03.583
future was not there. Having a dishwasher job in a 
waterfront cafe where all these workers come in,

24:03.603 --> 24:14.338
the dock workers come in. Rowdy, raunchy, rowdy 
place. Where was that? In San Pedro. That's where

24:23.095 --> 24:24.497
you were looking for the ships? Yeah. That was 
before you went north? Yeah, before I went north.

24:28.242 --> 24:33.670
These things are kind of like a bird landing and 
just checking it out. How did you usually leave

24:34.991 --> 24:36.233
your jobs? Did you just not show up the next day? Not 
show up. Make sure you got paid and that's it.

24:40.759 --> 24:41.440
Right. And generally, that was? Cash. Cash. And 
just something alerted you, or you just decided it

24:44.955 --> 24:48.760
was time to move? Fear, constant. I don't think the 
first three or four years, you really live in

24:51.464 --> 25:01.478
constant fear. Then later on, it goes partial 
fear. And then it gets a little less, but it never

25:05.043 --> 25:10.170
completely disappears. Did you think of writing 
to your folks Where to? Right.

25:20.368 --> 25:20.488
Right. During that period, you said that you 
really avoided reading the newspapers, that it

25:21.228 --> 25:31.825
was, what you were reading was too frightening. I 
could see two areas that would be very

25:31.846 --> 25:35.431
frightening. One was when you said the maps would 
be there and you weren't finding your village, and

25:35.612 --> 25:43.765
the devastation that you'd be reading about of 
your own country. Fierce fighting. And the other

25:45.578 --> 25:51.244
would be the revelation of the atrocities that 
were coming out of the concentration camps and so

25:45.578 --> 25:51.244
on. Were those both stories that you, well, okay, 
the first area you expressed has upset you. The

25:57.731 --> 26:05.760
second area, did you believe the stories

25:57.731 --> 26:05.760
of the atrocities? I would say there's definitely 
aberrations that took place. Did you believe them

26:10.425 --> 26:12.727
at the time or did you just shut it off? Not the 
first, not right away. At first I didn't because I

26:16.561 --> 26:32.861
left Germany that was entirely different

26:16.561 --> 26:32.861
from the one that occurred afterwards that 
changed in the actual war, the actual

26:16.561 --> 26:32.861
devastation. There was hardly anything going on 
in my time, so I didn't see anything that may have

26:32.881 --> 26:39.549
taken place somewhere. But you knew the Jews had 
been... Yeah, most of them, as far as I know, were

26:43.493 --> 26:51.849
gone overseas, and whoever took them to foreign 
countries were going all over the world. As far as I

26:52.751 --> 27:05.215
was told, they were allowed to leave, and they 
were, you know, so that was the point in time. We had

27:05.532 --> 27:07.034
a few. I remember we had a butcher, and I think we had 
a synagogue, and it was closed down. I would say

27:16.223 --> 27:25.773
maybe 200 people out of a population of 20,000, 
maybe something like that. I don't know. I'm just

27:26.394 --> 27:26.994
guessing. It was a small minority.

27:32.077 --> 27:48.177
So that's another horror story that I knew would 
not end and would stay in Europe for the next 10,000

27:32.077 --> 27:48.177
years.

27:51.100 --> 27:52.882
But you didn't feel any responsibility for it. You 
didn't have anything to do with it. There was no

27:54.484 --> 27:55.706
reason why you had to. That wouldn't have 
prevented you from saying to somebody that you

28:00.562 --> 28:07.498
were German or you were German, I mean, it was 
really that you were concerned about being

28:00.562 --> 28:07.498
apprehended. Yeah, I probably did, because I 
certainly didn't want to be associated with it.

28:17.821 --> 28:18.222
Right, I see, I see. Just like if you... found out 
you worked for a crooked company or something, you

28:20.305 --> 28:27.657
could certainly disassociate yourself as 
quickly as you can. So it made it a lot easier to

28:28.078 --> 28:30.121
amputate. Yeah, it made it a lot easier. I'm sorry, 
where did I start? I was just looking down at my list

28:37.453 --> 28:42.381
because I didn't know if I had another question, 
and that's what made these rules that I pulled from

28:37.453 --> 28:42.381
going here.

28:45.652 --> 28:50.820
Go ahead. Just a small one. When you talked about 
having this area way back and you've been

28:51.921 --> 29:02.157
quarantined, and you made a remark yesterday or 
the day before about your friends, you couldn't

28:51.921 --> 29:02.157
really keep in touch with them, but they could toss 
flowers out the window. I pictured there a second

29:02.818 --> 29:04.581
floor window. Were you up on the second story? No, 
but I could climb up into my first apartment. There

29:12.753 --> 29:15.897
was probably about seven feet off the ground. 
Could you get up so that your face was over the

29:15.978 --> 29:19.442
window so you and they could talk? Yeah, they could 
see me. I could see, yeah. You and they would talk.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.909
Sometimes it was without me, so there was 
conversation. They could stand there and we would

29:23.929 --> 29:25.932
talk, yeah. That is something that I found very 
hard to relate to about one of his studies, was his

29:26.512 --> 29:35.385
own bedroom. apparently was in the inner core of 
the house, and he told me, this is quite

29:35.365 --> 29:43.877
interesting, we had a period, we went to your 
parents' room. Yeah, they gave me their room. The

29:45.759 --> 29:52.829
room was this small, totally enclosed, no 
windows, no light kind of room, and no. And he talks

29:53.189 --> 29:55.412
about having claustrophobia. Claustrophobia, 
yeah. It could have been. My brother had the big

29:57.615 --> 30:02.402
room facing the street, Blue Brace Strasse, Do you 
know how to spell that? Yes, I have it on my

30:04.761 --> 30:07.569
postcard. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he had the largest 
room.

30:20.270 --> 30:23.077
So you didn't share a room with your brothers and 
sister? No. When I got old enough, they gave me

30:23.879 --> 30:26.245
that. It was almost a pass-through, like a large 
closet, had enough room for a bed. And it was

30:31.559 --> 30:35.629
adjacent to my parents' bedroom and adjacent to 
the living room. It would pass almost like a large

30:36.149 --> 30:40.613
walk-in closet. Yeah, a large walk-in closet with 
no windows. And Gina's always horrified. She has

30:45.718 --> 30:46.678
to have a window. She has to have air open. The 
window has to be open. And I said, I don't care.

30:51.363 --> 30:52.504
Close that thing. This was second floor, third 
floor? No, nine feet up. You could climb in it from

30:57.728 --> 30:59.250
the rear. I climbed into it many times. So the 
apartment was the first floor apartment? The

31:04.494 --> 31:05.295
first floor apartment. And then we had a basement. 
And my father made near beer down there, and

31:09.327 --> 31:17.495
cabbage and pickles, and saw pickles, and stuff 
like that. I miss what you're saying. I was

31:18.416 --> 31:29.768
thinking, I could understand possibly why a child 
would be

31:18.416 --> 31:29.768
prone to pneumonia and numbness being in a . And 
plus, an unbalanced diet and a horrible climate, a

31:30.976 --> 31:38.830
pretty tough climate to live in. You've got to be 
really, you know, A number one to survive there.

31:42.898 --> 31:46.284
Did your friends come through often then, or was it 
once a week? Did they every day on the way to school

31:46.364 --> 31:49.670
holler something to you? No, it was once a week. 
They kept in touch just to kind of cheer me up a

31:52.455 --> 31:54.739
little bit. That was an all-boys school where you 
were going. Yeah, all-boys, but the girls came.

32:00.745 --> 32:22.127
Yeah, because we had, I'm trying to think of the 
name of that girls' school, which was the exact

32:00.745 --> 32:22.127
equivalent to what we had, and it was Ursula von 
Miller that Hans was so crazy about, and Maria

32:00.745 --> 32:22.127
Hoffman comes to mind, the other one, the doctor's 
daughter, went to first eventually, got quit,

32:00.745 --> 32:22.127
and... I may have been one or two others,

32:22.647 --> 32:37.195
you know. So I had friends, good friends in school 
that tried to cheer me up. I

32:39.252 --> 32:58.567
got

32:39.252 --> 32:58.567
it from my cousin in Berlin. She died of it. I went 
into, I went to Berlin to cheer up her sister, and

33:00.110 --> 33:06.561
that was a really cute guest. They looked Irish, 
freckles, and I was reading books that she had got,

33:07.142 --> 33:18.743
you know, picked up the virus from the books. Also 
from that period, if you've already answered this

33:21.119 --> 33:28.297
in a letter or when I was out of the room, you don't 
need to answer, but I'm curious about your mom. If

33:29.180 --> 33:31.866
you could describe your mom, who was she? What was 
she like? She was a very pretty lady and she was very

33:32.749 --> 33:36.799
proud of herself. with a short aristocratic nose. 
She thinks I have it, but I don't. She hears much

33:44.851 --> 33:48.217
straighter and smaller. And her laugh, she had a 
marvelous laughter. She could get my father out of

33:52.784 --> 34:02.178
any mood that he was in by tickling his ears or 
blowing in his ears and laughing. It got him to

34:03.079 --> 34:05.503
smile. She had the loudest sneeze of anyone. And I 
still have a similar one. People always get

34:12.077 --> 34:14.640
startled when I sneeze. I mean, she just blew out 
the windows when she sneezed. And I do a similar

34:18.145 --> 34:21.369
number even to this day. And

34:22.210 --> 34:33.043
she was always nursing me for something, hot and 
cold conferences for pneumonia or diphtheria.

34:33.123 --> 34:36.047
And so she had a heck of a time with me. And I guess 
it's

34:36.584 --> 34:41.810
awful hard to raise somebody. And you can see it in a 
picture that I'm the thinnest of the bunch. Very

34:44.734 --> 34:52.803
thin and very underweight and always, you know, 
skin and bones, they used to call me. You could

34:52.903 --> 35:00.593
count the ribs, you know, and I have pictures even

34:52.903 --> 35:00.593
in this country of my skinny chest.

35:03.556 --> 35:05.899
So I was always concerned with my... I

35:06.368 --> 35:18.806
did my own reading. She would always just supply me 
with whatever I wanted. I had a little talk and chit

35:23.192 --> 35:28.259
chat and cheer

35:23.192 --> 35:28.259
me up. But I had my own books. I was more into reading 
than they were. My parents get too busy to read.

35:38.913 --> 35:40.336
They have to raise a family. And my father's hobby 
was his pigeons, his Puffer pigeons, which he had

35:40.356 --> 35:46.467
in the back. He built a cage over in the dump that we 
had our garbage dump. And we spent many hours

35:51.977 --> 35:54.702
there. Did your

35:55.357 --> 36:18.471
father ever take you on the train? Oh, all the time. 
Yeah. So you went to Breslau, maybe, and you went

36:21.295 --> 36:23.558
to... We'd meet him at the depot, sometimes pick 
him up, or I'd hang around the depot a lot to get a

36:24.280 --> 36:33.232
picture of him. And read the magazines, have a 
magazine stand there just like they have here.

36:39.239 --> 36:42.884
Read foreign, maybe foreign newspapers even. 
Because I remember reading a lot about England was

36:46.859 --> 36:52.647
running the world at that time. So I remember 
reading what they said. And at first, I remember

36:58.975 --> 37:11.611
reading the word common sense, which is a very 
popular expression in the English language, but

36:58.975 --> 37:11.611
not in German. I don't think there's a word for it, 
even. And I was always interested in finding out

37:15.817 --> 37:21.649
what common sense was. The search for common 
sense. The search for common sense. I wanted to

37:24.656 --> 37:26.360
pursue that. So do we all.

37:30.629 --> 37:34.517
Because we had proverbs and things like that. They 
contained maybe some common sense, but they also

37:35.172 --> 37:42.781
contained a lot of stuff that you didn't really 
need. In fact, I just opened one up here. That's the

37:44.583 --> 37:46.065
page. This is from Christine Von of Sweden. The 
first line I can't translate. Maybe you can. I

37:54.555 --> 37:56.698
forget what those words are. Faden, what's a 
faden? A pen, yes. A pen, yes. You cannot write with

38:02.240 --> 38:04.203
a borrowed pen? Yes, you can't write long with a 
borrowed pen. Man kann nicht lange. You can't

38:09.731 --> 38:12.074
write with a borrowed pen for long. You know, old 
wives tales and homilies. You can't do it for long.

38:22.189 --> 38:25.834
Yeah, and this one down here is kind of good.

38:29.577 --> 38:34.882
Man soll seine Geheimnisse niemals unnötig 
ausplaudern. One should not blurb out your

38:34.982 --> 38:41.087
secrets unnecessarily. Exactly that. Right 
there. And that's Christine of Sweden, the Queen

38:44.651 --> 38:49.435
of Sweden. She was born on December 18th. These are 
all people, everything relates to December 18th.

38:55.280 --> 38:58.403
A horoscope, that's a good thing. During your 
childhood, would you portray yourself as a very

38:58.940 --> 39:04.945
well-behaved child, or mischievous, or a 
combination? Who were you? I would say a

39:06.106 --> 39:07.107
combination. I would get occasionally into 
trouble. And how would they discipline you? Oh, I

39:11.571 --> 39:22.901
did get a call to the principal's room one time, and 
it was really a pretty horrifying experience to be

39:11.571 --> 39:22.901
threatened with expulsion and things like that. 
Yes, they really landed on me. It was pretty

39:28.505 --> 39:31.969
frightening. But most of the time, I was in the 
middle. I was associated with the troublemaker,

39:37.515 --> 39:42.001
which was Hans Souvan. He was my best friend, but I 
wasn't the actual troublemaker. So you might say I

39:46.005 --> 39:54.054
was just near trouble all the time, but not 
necessarily in it. Did your parents discipline

39:54.074 --> 39:58.039
you harshly? Well, they, I think they laid down 
some pretty straight rules and they just, I always

39:59.538 --> 40:07.451
had the feeling they wanted just the best. They 
wanted me to be, you know, better than they are and

40:08.072 --> 40:27.182
get a better education, get a better job, don't 
work so hard so you don't have to work so hard like my

40:08.072 --> 40:27.182
father does and, you know, get a nice easy job like 
we had a renter upstairs who worked for the city and

40:27.348 --> 40:28.529
So your father owned the building? Yeah, he owned 
the building. I see, I see. So he was the

40:30.612 --> 40:31.653
supervisor. You had to solve the problems of the 
people who lived in the building, fix their

40:32.253 --> 40:37.639
plumbing, do things like that. Yeah, he was very 
good at it. Because he had been a superintendent on

40:38.360 --> 40:44.227
a construction before he, right after his war. 
World War I, right? Yeah, he had to show me

40:46.009 --> 40:47.270
pictures. He had been a construction 
superintendent before. He was very good at fixing

40:51.795 --> 40:54.638
anything in the building. Yeah,

40:55.310 --> 40:59.917
that's right. If things got really rough, I would 
crawl under the table. If you couldn't get me out.

41:05.485 --> 41:07.428
You mean, like, got really rough? Well, if I was 
scolded for not doing this, then the other,

41:07.828 --> 41:22.009
whether my shoes were too dirty or I didn't do my 
homework or whatever, if they were landing on me,

41:07.828 --> 41:22.009
leaning on me too hard, asking me, I would 
simply... We had a big, like that Spanish table. We

41:26.122 --> 41:29.447
had a heavy wood table. And so I crawled and was 
playing with that. Were you hidden so they didn't

41:31.610 --> 41:33.473
know where you were? Or was it just that they knew 
that you were hiding out? At first, I thought they

41:35.876 --> 41:39.762
probably didn't know where I was because he was 
there. Tablecloth. Tablecloth hanging over it so

41:40.563 --> 41:43.967
I had my own little private hideout. I found that a 
very interesting story because that's what they

41:44.107 --> 41:53.517
do when he says, when people hassle me too much or 
things get too rough, and the tablecloth.

41:53.597 --> 41:55.780
Tablecloth under the table and you got your. And 
you cannot get him out. And that's what he is. It's

42:00.105 --> 42:04.970
like when I was to the point of really pressing, 
pressing. And then I wouldn't listen to them

42:04.990 --> 42:06.472
either. In other words, they could tell me to come 
out, but I wouldn't. So there was a standoff. Yes,

42:12.539 --> 42:13.481
yes. Mexican standoff. Just let it blow over.

42:19.191 --> 42:20.133
Describe your dad. Well, the shocker, I had a 
shocker a few years back when I opened the page in a

42:21.696 --> 42:33.998
newspaper and I see this picture and I says, that's 
my dad. You know, looked just like him, square

42:34.433 --> 42:41.745
face, little sparse hair, but squarish face. And I 
read on, and it was,

42:42.687 --> 42:50.740
his name is General Brown, Chief of Staff. Oh, yes. 
That's what he looks like. At least that's what I

42:54.507 --> 42:56.690
thought he looked like. Yeah, I remember General 
Brown. That was a few years back. I recall, Chief of

43:00.033 --> 43:01.114
Staff. That was when he said something about 
the... Maybe Brown looked a little bit better, but

43:01.134 --> 43:05.239
that could be his brother. You know, you want to 
resemble... And I was always looking for these

43:05.860 --> 43:10.506
similarities. I don't know why that makes you feel 
better to see. Instead of being in a strange land,

43:14.151 --> 43:20.218
I'm converting a strange land into a... a land that 
is full of things that I know. Yes, yes, that's

43:23.928 --> 43:25.930
reasonable. So I always, whether this is right or 
not, I just made this up. Was your dad a harsh man or a

43:31.096 --> 43:47.533
gentle man, authoritarian or

43:31.096 --> 43:47.533
democratic? I would say he was... Not... You could 
talk to him. But, you know, he was a macho man and a

43:51.502 --> 44:01.475
very busy man with his job, working his odd hours, 
had his own hobbies, lived his own life,

43:51.502 --> 44:01.475
therefore. And they had a marvelous relationship 
with his wife, as you can see with their fights and

44:02.777 --> 44:15.754
their open affection that was openly displayed.

44:17.810 --> 44:27.483
But the usual estrangement of, you know, this 
modern young man going to this fancy school,

44:17.810 --> 44:27.483
learning foreign languages that they know 
nothing about. I'm sure there was a certain

44:27.543 --> 44:32.330
estrangement. We had our generation gap. I don't 
think that was definitely there. I'm sure

44:41.983 --> 44:43.284
everybody has those. And you have to come to terms 
with that kind of thing. But you never thought of

44:49.973 --> 45:00.670
going into the railroad business, or you never 
thought of raising pigeons yourself, or of... No,

44:49.973 --> 45:00.670
I had to have my own world already. And I was maybe a 
little disappointed he never came down to watch me

45:01.692 --> 45:07.681
play tennis. That was maybe a little strange. 
That, I think, probably was... I have to give him a

45:13.210 --> 45:14.191
minus for that. But other than that, like I said, he 
had his own things. Yeah. Why do you think he didn't

45:18.113 --> 45:20.016
come down to see you? I don't know. He was always 
proud. He said he saw the name in the paper. He saw

45:23.142 --> 45:27.268
the score.

45:27.449 --> 45:30.213
But nothing like that. You know, the doting 
parents like now, Christ, you know, kind of a world

45:30.233 --> 45:35.582
champion or something like that. None of this, no. 
However, just an aside on the tennis, the one that

45:36.937 --> 45:57.659
did come to watch me, unbeknownst to me, this girl 
that blonde in Waldenburg that I was so crazy about

45:36.937 --> 45:57.659
whose mother did not care for me, because the 
championships were held in Waldenburg, her

45:36.937 --> 45:57.659
hometown. And later on, when I met her again after, 
because I got a weight into the army.
