00:04.132 --> 00:05.253
Okay. One of the most educational lessons that I 
believe that I ever observed in my life on the ranch

00:05.273 --> 00:16.388
was down on Pepper Bluff. There's only one passage 
up that bluff that you could get over it and get to

00:17.409 --> 00:24.539
the Three Springs Passage. Horseback. And you had 
to go around the point of the bluff, and if you

00:27.202 --> 00:32.569
didn't have a sure-footed horse, you're... just 
as sure to get dunked in that hole of water, which

00:33.106 --> 00:42.908
was about 10 to 20 feet deep as you were for, dime was 
for a ginger snapper. Now that was regular, but

00:43.409 --> 00:47.899
that was the only way we could get there. And we'd go 
up this bluff and go to Three Springs Pasture to

00:52.057 --> 00:55.644
gather the cattle to bring back. We didn't bring 
them back that way. We'd have to take them a mile and

00:57.929 --> 01:03.199
a half to two miles up the river to cross them. Now 
that was real work. And you knew what you had to do,

01:05.925 --> 01:10.013
and you didn't ask questions. But we came around 
the point of Pepper Bluff, which Definitely the

01:14.078 --> 01:27.492
water comes right up to the bluff itself, and you 
bring your horse right down at the edge of it, and

01:14.078 --> 01:27.492
the rock slants into the water, and it's slick as 
owl's grease. And if you're not very careful, and

01:28.393 --> 01:36.182
you must give your horse its own time. Don't kick 
him. Don't spur him. Let him feel his way and let him

01:39.712 --> 01:44.418
be a sure-footed person. He's got more sense about 
that than you have. Right. So let him go. And we got

01:49.685 --> 02:05.726
around this point, and I saw an old mama coon, and I 
hollered at my daddy, and he took his finger up to my

01:49.685 --> 02:05.726
mouth and he shook it to be quiet. Mm-hmm. And I went 
on over to where he was. He said, I want to show you

02:09.246 --> 02:11.831
something. All right, she came up this trail, and 
she had four babies behind her. Oh, yeah. And she

02:17.702 --> 02:19.605
got up to this pond. I said pond. She got up to this 
hole of water. Mm-hmm. And just before you get to

02:23.907 --> 02:39.220
this real deep hole, there was an eddy water hole 
out at the side, which was about, oh, I guess maybe

02:23.907 --> 02:39.220
12 inches deep. But you could see the fish running 
in it, and you could see lots of minnows, great big

02:39.240 --> 02:46.527
red-hossed minnows. And we were way back, not way 
back, but we were... I guess we were about 25 or 30

02:52.831 --> 03:02.891
feet back and there was a big rock in front of us. So 
we put our horses there and my daddy told me to get on

03:02.931 --> 03:11.188
top of this rock so I could watch all the 
maneuvering. So the old mama coon raccoon yeah but

03:13.216 --> 03:36.034
we call them coons out here comes up this trail and 
she gets to this hole this eddy water and she takes

03:13.216 --> 03:36.034
number one and sets him and she just takes him with 
both hands with her front feet and just socks him

03:13.216 --> 03:36.034
down on that ground just like he'd been bad and she 
chattered something of course she chattered to

03:36.014 --> 03:59.018
him which to me meant you sit there she gets number 
two and sets him number three and she gets number

03:36.014 --> 03:59.018
four and she takes him behind these babies comes 
over here and she goes into this water and she

03:36.014 --> 03:59.018
catches um Red Horse Minnow. And she has it in both 
paws when she gets out. And she gets down. and puts

04:07.958 --> 04:13.265
it in her mouth, and she just shakes it and shakes it 
in this water. Then she takes both hands and washes

04:13.285 --> 04:19.914
it and feeds this baby over here. She goes back and 
she puts this baby way over here, away from the rest

04:20.915 --> 04:27.905
of them. She goes back and she gets this other baby 
and moves him up, and she chatters and chatters.

04:35.815 --> 04:37.037
She goes in... And she gets another one. This time 
she gets a perch. She brings back. She catches it.

04:45.540 --> 04:46.861
And you'd be surprised. She dives down in under and 
comes up. It's fantastic to see how she does.

04:55.492 --> 04:56.873
Catches them with her paws. Yes. And brings them 
out. And then... Number three was smart. There's

05:06.751 --> 05:09.775
always got to be a smart aleck in every group. So he 
goes up and gets ahead of her and goes in. Man, she

05:15.162 --> 05:25.937
got him, she brought him back out of that thing and 
she just shook him just like you would shake

05:15.162 --> 05:25.937
somebody with her two front feet. Just shook him 
good and popped him down and he didn't get one.

05:32.350 --> 05:35.375
until she fed the next one. And then she finally fed 
him. And to me, that was one of the greatest lessons

05:38.861 --> 05:54.426
that I have ever learned in that you mind your 
parents, and you take what they give you, whether

05:38.861 --> 05:54.426
it's first or last. She's calling. Did you get that 
animal fed? Uh-huh. Go see her stomach. I bet it's

06:04.046 --> 06:06.208
full all right. Well, thank you, sweetheart. 
Okay.

06:13.174 --> 06:13.434
I'll see you. Okay. Okay. But that to me was one of 
the greatest lessons. Uh-huh. I mean, even

06:18.799 --> 06:23.383
animals are taught to obey their parents. Even 
animals are taught certain things that will help

06:23.853 --> 06:32.995
them. That society of the animal world is real. 
Absolutely. The family structure is real. That's

06:38.668 --> 06:39.330
right. And where are we? What are we doing to our 
family structure? We're tearing it apart. There

06:45.740 --> 06:48.443
isn't a family structure in this country anymore. 
But it was with them. I know. All right. What

06:52.027 --> 06:54.650
does...

06:56.131 --> 07:03.859
When you take a Kildee, when you go down on the river 
and you get near her nest, she falls over. She plays

07:04.080 --> 07:05.201
dead. She flops and she winks and she cries. Well, 
you know better. If you know a Kildee, you know

07:10.293 --> 07:12.876
better, right? If you know a Kildee, you know 
what's wrong, so you go on. And she is attracting

07:16.601 --> 07:19.164
your attention. Right, and pulling you. And 
pulling you away from her baby. I've had that

07:23.129 --> 07:23.830
happen. That's mother instinct. Mother 
instinct. Oh, yes. That's so true. We're very

07:31.139 --> 07:35.464
close to that animal world, and we just don't like 
to think that sometimes. We just don't like to

07:35.484 --> 07:37.487
recognize it. But it's true. Right. All right. Do 
you remember yesterday when I saw the twin deer,

07:41.461 --> 07:55.766
Fawn and the mama deer, the doe on the bank and they 
were down watering? Uh-huh. That head was working

07:55.946 --> 07:58.070
on a pivot. Right. Going back and forth, back and 
forth, watching. Uh-huh. She didn't make a noise.

08:05.926 --> 08:07.328
She merely snorted. And what did they do? They 
moved. All right. A mother can stand out here at the

08:13.799 --> 08:20.671
side of the road and watching her child, and she'll 
scream 40 times for him to stop. And he'll say,

08:20.691 --> 08:22.774
well, what do I have to do for her? That's a 
breakdown in the chain of bonding. That is exactly

08:27.562 --> 08:29.064
right. That's a bonding break. It really is. A 
mother will stand and say, don't get out there in

08:32.188 --> 08:35.231
that street. You're going to get run over. Don't do 
that. Well, why? I want to go across the street. But

08:42.420 --> 08:49.810
when that mama deer snorted one time, they left 
that water. Yeah. They did. They really did. They

08:53.111 --> 08:55.234
led the blue streak right up that hill. They sure 
did. They got out of the way. We're above animal

08:59.219 --> 09:05.487
life. We're supposed to be. We are. But what has 
happened to us? We're not bonding with our

09:10.983 --> 09:13.188
children any longer. That's right. Not at all. 
There's mothers and babies aren't bonding.

09:17.657 --> 09:20.122
Fathers and babies aren't bonding. No. And unless 
you bond with your infant, It's a very dangerous

09:23.656 --> 09:25.078
world. It's worse than dangerous. It's worse than 
dangerous. Well, it's like the day was. I know we

09:31.589 --> 09:41.445
really didn't have hospitalization for women, 
which is a marvelous thing because fewer women die

09:31.589 --> 09:41.445
in childbirth nowadays than they did back even in 
the 40s. But I think there's a problem, in my

09:41.425 --> 09:56.565
opinion, is again that in the sterility of the 
American hospital, right now American

09:41.425 --> 09:56.565
gynecologists, Ava, are fighting to keep 
midwives from working in cities. They don't want

09:57.575 --> 10:00.258
registered midwives. People who've been nurse 
practitioners and nurses, they don't want women

10:00.939 --> 10:06.886
delivering women's babies anymore. And I know you 
can tell me something about that. I know that's

10:10.611 --> 10:11.832
very true. I was quite a young girl, and 12 o'clock 
at night, we had no doctor here. He had gone to a

10:18.420 --> 10:22.445
convention, and he wasn't here. There was none at 
Blanco. There was none at Fredericksburg. This

10:27.275 --> 10:34.705
knock came to my door and said, Miss Ava, my wife's 
in labor, and we're having a baby, and I don't know

10:27.275 --> 10:34.705
what to do. And I said, my land, man, I don't know 
either. But I'll come. I'll do what I can do. So I

10:41.615 --> 10:47.663
went down there, and she was in labor. My land, I'd 
never done anything like that. Was this before you

10:51.551 --> 10:53.514
had your own? Yes, it was long before I had. See, we 
were married six years before Perky was born. So

10:59.745 --> 11:02.931
this was about four years after we'd married. I was 
about 22 years old. Or hardly, maybe 21. But I went

11:08.200 --> 11:10.123
on down there. And I felt so sorry for that woman. 
She was just really having a hard time. And I said,

11:18.017 --> 11:34.407
well, honey, I don't know anything, but it looks to 
me like if you'd put your legs up in rafter shape in

11:18.017 --> 11:34.407
the bed and put your hands on them and push down on 
your legs, It might help you. I don't know anything

11:36.481 --> 11:40.908
about this, but maybe... You must have been 
terrified. I was terrified, and I was afraid she

11:40.928 --> 11:46.476
was going to die, and I didn't know what in the world 
I would do. I just was scared to death. And I said,

11:49.220 --> 11:50.662
then keep pushing. Well, the second time come 
around and push, well, out come Mr. Baby just

11:50.923 --> 11:59.135
really crying. Well, there I was. What do you do? 
Mm-hmm. What do you do in a case like that? I didn't

12:08.885 --> 12:11.288
know about cutting a cord. I knew the afterbirth 
was chained to it. I knew if it wasn't taken care of

12:15.052 --> 12:18.797
at a certain time, that it would die. And I knew if it 
wasn't cut off at a certain time, it'd bleed to

12:18.817 --> 12:22.221
death. And I didn't know doodle and do. And there 
wasn't any telephone. There was two telephones on

12:27.648 --> 12:29.610
our street. Two! From the garage up to Klitz. One at 
my house and one at Klitz. And that was all the

12:37.812 --> 12:39.514
telephone. So I said to him, I said, did you know 
anything about this? And he was a father, and

12:46.081 --> 12:48.724
they'd had two before. He said, I've had a doctor 
each time, and I don't know. But they usually cut

12:52.668 --> 12:58.815
the cord and tie it. And then the afterbirth will 
pass. Oh, I said, oh, I don't know. I don't know. I

13:05.127 --> 13:07.491
just don't know what to do. But anyway, I got a 
spring and I tied it. I tied it on and then cut the

13:13.019 --> 13:16.624
cord. It was just guesswork. I really didn't know. 
And I just kept saying, well, God, if you'll just

13:22.201 --> 13:29.049
give me the strength and tell me and help me out, 
just help me through this. I tell you right now,

13:29.209 --> 13:37.118
there was a constant prayer going through my mind 
all the time because I just didn't know. And there

13:38.259 --> 13:42.104
wasn't anything that we could do because there 
wasn't anybody we could get. And so in a little bit,

13:43.245 --> 13:49.632
she passed after birth. Well, all right. Then I 
went ahead, cleaned up the baby, and clothed it,

13:52.778 --> 14:01.246
and put it back in her bed. Then I cleaned her up and 
cleaned up the bed, which I had it pretty well

14:01.326 --> 14:08.533
padded already. I didn't have any plastic. I had 
oil cloth, which came off the table. I got the table

14:15.379 --> 14:20.144
cloth and put under it so it wouldn't get on the bed 
or anything. And I cleaned all that up. and cleaned

14:21.989 --> 14:26.496
her up, and he was born on Halloween night. Oh, my 
goodness. Now, if you don't think that I was, I felt

14:27.577 --> 14:35.589
like a witch, well, you're just, you're just poor. 
But they got along just fine. But I was just 22 years

14:38.413 --> 14:40.837
old. And that was the first baby you ever 
delivered. Ever delivered. First one that I'd

14:44.042 --> 14:45.744
ever seen born. I delivered lots of calves. I 
delivered lots of little pigs. and lots of lambs

14:51.132 --> 14:56.862
and goats, but I never delivered a baby. That was 
something else. But that was a part of life because

15:00.308 --> 15:03.753
everybody knew it was coming, right? Yes. You knew 
that it was going to happen one way or another.

15:06.758 --> 15:09.022
There was going to be babies. They couldn't be too 
much different. from the other, but for the same

15:12.209 --> 15:20.279
token, these were animals, and this was a little 
life. This was a little human being that I was

15:20.559 --> 15:25.044
dealing with. Was this a family from the city, a 
regular long stand? They worked as, he was a

15:28.549 --> 15:41.524
mechanic, and his name was Phelps, and he spelt it 
P-H-E-L-P-S.

15:28.549 --> 15:41.524
And

15:28.549 --> 15:41.524
he was a good man. and a good woman, but they were 
poor. They were honest, but poor.

15:53.745 --> 15:54.467
I'll never forget that. And Olin would wipe. I just 
perspired. I mean, the perspiration. It wasn't

16:01.864 --> 16:03.206
perspiration. It was purity sweat. Did you ever 
deliver any more babies after that? Oh, yes. I bet

16:07.453 --> 16:09.836
you were just designated midwife then. I was 
designated midwife for a long, long time. I

16:14.203 --> 16:15.405
guarantee you that. Now that's something. That's 
something that we just don't see anymore. You just

16:18.750 --> 16:20.793
don't see and you don't have to do it. Unless it's a 
woman physician, women don't touch women

16:20.813 --> 16:23.998
anymore. Oh, no. You realize that? No, no. Women do 
not touch and help and deliver babies except in the

16:25.541 --> 16:31.133
poor communities. Well, I had twins down here at 
the ranch. Uh-huh. And they called me. The

16:34.941 --> 16:36.084
doctor's out of town. He called me, and I went down 
and delivered twins. Really? To Tony Gonzalez's

16:38.930 --> 16:41.675
mother. Really? Right out here that works on 
the... And when he called today about that car, I

16:43.840 --> 16:47.949
said, Tony, take care of it for me. I don't have 
time. He said, I will, Miss Silver. I'll do

16:50.715 --> 16:52.799
anything you ask me to do. Yeah. All right. It was 
his mother that I took care of. Right. Naturally,

16:58.050 --> 17:00.676
he's not going to turn me down. Of course not. 
That's a bonding in the community between you and

17:01.778 --> 17:06.464
the people that you're close to. That's right. Do 
you think that maybe we're just so sterile in our

17:07.325 --> 17:11.030
society today? I think so. That we just don't touch 
each other, we don't deliver our babies, we don't

17:12.091 --> 17:20.082
wipe the bodies clean before we bury them? No, sir. 
We don't touch each other? Uh-uh. Not anymore.

17:24.908 --> 17:28.152
That's a crime that we're committing against 
ourselves, isn't it? I think it's one of the

17:28.333 --> 17:30.115
biggest... Well, it's something that we've lost 
touch with. Yeah, it is. It's something that we

17:39.033 --> 17:48.030
have grown out of that means so much to life. To me, 
it does. To me, too. I do believe that. I really do. I

17:56.070 --> 18:02.058
never thought of it in the manner that Ms. Kammack 
explained it to me. Right. But, boy, she made a

18:03.039 --> 18:05.443
believer out of me. And she taught me, and she 
worked me, and I was her sidekick. She was an old

18:10.490 --> 18:17.840
lady when she took me under her wing and taught me to 
do these things. And I owe a lot to her. And I love

18:20.298 --> 18:21.163
her. She was a wonderful person.

18:27.402 --> 18:30.406
She and Aunt Mary were first cousins. Oh, were 
they? They were. And you know how I loved Aunt Mary.

18:34.932 --> 18:35.253
I do. And you know how Aunt Mary loved me. She did. 
And she gave me a very bad time because I hadn't

18:37.937 --> 18:42.323
brought any deer meat. That's how I went with you. 
Yes, she did then. She was fussing at you for not

18:45.167 --> 18:48.712
bringing her any deer meat. Every year, if I didn't 
bring her deer meat, she would get me. So I always

18:52.597 --> 18:56.021
managed to take her near me. She was the sweetest 
thing. Aunt Mary Galbraith was her name. Right.

19:03.831 --> 19:06.575
And she was 100 and what when she died? I believe 
she's 106. Yeah, that's what I had thought it was

19:08.357 --> 19:11.181
too. 106 years old. Incredible. And you know she 
busted Lennon's little old fanny knot one time.

19:19.391 --> 19:20.292
But it doesn't. Well, mine too, as far as that goes. 
They'd take us over there to a picnic or a barbecue

19:23.102 --> 19:29.313
on the 4th of July. And she lived down close on the 
creek. And we'd go to Aunt Mary's, and she had a

19:32.719 --> 19:38.810
fenced-in yard, and we'd play in that creek and 
whatnot. And she told us not to wait in it and get our

19:38.830 --> 19:43.037
clothes dirty because we didn't have a change. We 
did it. And boy, she laid it on us. She didn't ask any

19:47.582 --> 19:50.568
questions. She laid it on us. Never will forget one 
time we was over there and she said, well, I'm one

19:52.111 --> 20:00.268
person in Blanco that can say I've spanked the 
president. that's cute just you know she was cute

20:00.248 --> 20:26.830
she was smart right up to the last minute i like that 
that's a good line i'm one person i'm one person in

20:00.248 --> 20:26.830
blanco that can say i spanked the president that's 
great seriously she said she asked me she said do

20:00.248 --> 20:26.830
you remember when you cried and begged to go at your 
daddy and he told you you had to stay here with me And

20:26.810 --> 20:28.032
I said, yes. And he said, you remember you just kept 
crying? I said, sure do. He says, what happened? I

20:32.279 --> 20:34.662
said, you just spanked me good. He said, if you've 
got to cry, I'll give you something to cry for. I

20:39.810 --> 20:40.872
remember that. Yeah. If you've got to cry, I'll 
give you something to cry for. And she swatted me

20:45.679 --> 20:52.049
about three swats at that hand, and I realized I 
didn't have a thing to cry for. Yeah. But I just

20:53.287 --> 20:56.751
wanted to tag along with my daddy. Sure. That's 
all. Right. That's something. No, it's just a

21:01.776 --> 21:04.418
spoiled kid. That's right. I know. That's what you 
were, a spoiled kid. When it came to your daddy.

21:11.305 --> 21:12.046
Yes, it was. I can see why. If I wanted anything, I'd 
call up in his lap. I'd love him. I'd tell him how

21:19.494 --> 21:22.737
sweet he was. Pretty quick, I got it. I want a new 
bridal. That's the way I got it. I never asked for

21:31.855 --> 21:37.587
clothes or shoes or find things. I wanted a new 
bridle or a new saddle blanket or a new girth for my

21:39.911 --> 21:46.059
saddle. It was always something for my heart so I 
could follow just a little closer to my daddy. Now

21:53.068 --> 21:55.091
that is so right. There were three children and I 
was my daddy's boy. Right. I can see. I was my

22:04.704 --> 22:07.708
daddy's boy and nothing more. And it's just like a 
lady said, well, Wilma Fawcett, a cousin of mine

22:07.823 --> 22:28.347
said, you know, I just can't see you quilting and 
crocheting and doing the fine artwork that you do

22:07.823 --> 22:28.347
today when I can see you riding the roughest bronc 
that ever rode up there and calves and roping.

22:28.580 --> 22:31.606
That's both sides of the story there as a woman. 
Your versatility speaks for itself, doesn't it?

22:34.613 --> 22:34.713
Yeah. You do. My daddy wanted me to know how to roll. 
You didn't have to give up one ounce of your

22:38.822 --> 22:44.854
femininity, one ounce of your womanliness. I 
didn't. And at the same time, you had all the fun of

22:46.197 --> 22:48.600
the boys. I sure did. And I could ride just as long as 
they could and rope just as good. I know you could

22:56.069 --> 22:58.532
enjoy it just as much. And when I look back, that old 
house up there that's taken as a bride, and I know

22:59.713 --> 23:14.230
that in 1935, I

22:59.713 --> 23:14.230
won enough money. In the barrel racing and the 
breakaway at a rodeo, to buy that bathroom, it

23:16.083 --> 23:22.874
means a million dollars to me. Oh, I know. I know. 
That bathroom over there that you bought by racing

23:24.717 --> 23:28.604
barrels. I love it. Racing barrels and breakaway. 
Men and women, it's open breakaway. Right. And I

23:36.517 --> 23:38.601
won first place. And every dime of it went for 
bathroom. 1935. The equalizer in Texas was the

23:44.692 --> 23:50.903
horse because it gave us cowboys and it gave us 
cowgirls. And there's no doubt that we had some of

23:50.984 --> 23:55.272
the finest women in history were cowgirls. That's 
right. And let me tell you then, It wasn't

23:58.017 --> 24:00.863
commercialized like it is now. It was this old gal 
out here in the country that picked up, well, can

24:01.324 --> 24:05.312
you do it? Get out there and show them if you can do 
it. I'll never forget, I rode old Eagle, which

24:08.558 --> 24:16.735
belonged to Blackie Johnson, and he's a 
cold-jawed outfit that ever lived. Yet he was a

24:16.715 --> 24:20.601
good horse and a smart horse. And I was coming back 
on that last barrel from the end of the field and I

24:20.621 --> 24:37.508
reached back with my spurs and grabbed him and I 
mean I hooked him in there and what we did, we came

24:20.621 --> 24:37.508
right through that arena, jumped that darn gate, 
went right around that racetrack. And there was no

24:37.842 --> 24:40.768
way that I could stop him. And I was doing well to 
stay on. And I hooked him with those spurs to stay

24:44.075 --> 24:49.887
on, and he was going that much faster. Oh, I'll 
never forget that if I live. was a double show.

24:55.703 --> 24:56.524
Uh-huh. And what was that? What rodeo was it? Oh, at 
Lamb Passes. At Lamb Passes? At Lamb Passes. What

25:01.912 --> 25:02.933
year was that? About 19... I guess about 1936. 
Uh-huh. How about that? How about that? Well,

25:11.666 --> 25:14.089
it... That was something else. I bet my mother was 
sitting there watching because she lived in

25:14.109 --> 25:18.115
Kintner. I want you to know that that grandstand 
got up They hooped, they hollered. I bet they did.

25:26.480 --> 25:30.483
Well, it was a show, I'm not kidding you. Because 
when I hooked around that last barrel, I just

25:30.623 --> 25:37.730
reached back with my spurs and I hooked him. I 
didn't know that he had been on the racetrack. I

25:41.233 --> 25:42.193
didn't know that. He was quite a ho. Man alive, it 
was all I could do. You talk about an old girl

25:46.757 --> 25:48.699
clawing leather. I just laid down just like a 
little leech. That's all you could do on that

25:52.042 --> 25:56.414
horse. And we went right on over that gate. They 
didn't even have time to open it. We just went right

26:03.392 --> 26:07.182
on over the gate, went right on around that 
tractor, And when they come back, the snubbing,

26:08.090 --> 26:15.744
the bronze snubbing horse caught us. Yes, I was 
happy to get off. I bet. Well, that's another part

26:21.213 --> 26:24.099
of your life. But I think women cheat themselves 
today. Well, I don't say that it's a wonderful

26:29.082 --> 26:35.171
thing or anything like that. I think it's 
wonderful that you know how to do it. I think it was

26:38.256 --> 26:43.563
something that we learned as children to excel in. 
Horsemanship, you mean? Horsemanship. And lots

26:47.990 --> 26:51.535
of times, your horse is a lot smarter than you are. 
Probably, yeah. I know. I ride. And I enjoyed it.

26:56.883 --> 26:58.245
Yeah. Up to this day, I have a record for three 
barrels, figure eight, three barrels, the full

26:59.069 --> 27:10.707
length of the rodeo standing. Yes. Really? In 11 
seconds. Wow. Yeah, that's fast time. You know why

27:18.310 --> 27:19.932
it's fast time? I'm gonna just tell you. Okay. They 
asked me what, they asked me about, I asked when I

27:21.835 --> 27:26.844
entered. I know what it's like. Do you have to, is 
there any regulation as to how you ride? Uh-huh.

27:33.574 --> 27:35.157
No, just ride. I got me a polo saddle. Oh, yes, I did. 
When you go around those barrels, hook that leg up

27:40.983 --> 27:50.395
around the weathers of that horse so that you don't 
hit it. Right. So you don't turn your barrel over.

27:53.699 --> 27:55.061
Yeah, that was my problem. All right. If you'd had a 
polo saddle and you'd pull those feet up. Yeah. you

28:00.848 --> 28:03.439
know, right up around his windows. And you have 
that flag in your mouth. Take it out and stick it in

28:05.910 --> 28:07.517
that bucket. Pick the next one up and stick it in 
your mouth. Yes. Getting around the next one. Yes.

28:15.263 --> 28:17.466
And the next time I rode, I rode bareback. It's 
easier to ride bareback than it is to ride with a

28:18.247 --> 28:21.931
polo saddle. Well, when you're kicking the 
stirrups and you're going around those things,

28:22.192 --> 28:28.019
your leather's bound to scrape. Sure is. I know. I 
used to knock my barrels over every time I rode. But

28:32.404 --> 28:34.467
if you ride bareback... You won't be doing that. 
That's what it did at Lamb Passage. That's true. I

28:37.832 --> 28:40.135
mean, not at Lamb Passage, but at Goldsway. Right. 
That's how I know the horse shifts with the weight

28:40.336 --> 28:43.460
from that saddle. He just moves right into it. Sure 
he does. You can't help it because he's not on a

28:45.303 --> 28:47.346
curb. At Goldsway, I rode bareback. Yeah. I won 
money there. Wow. But then it was all right, but now

28:51.872 --> 28:57.661
it's common. Oh, yeah. So what? So what? I'm going 
to stop here for a second. All right.
