00:01.668 --> 00:03.491
This is an interview with O.D.

00:06.276 --> 00:10.543
Butler, Brigadier General, United States Army, 
retired.

00:13.187 --> 00:16.452
This is the first interview in the series, Aggies 
to Generals. Today's date is July 23, 1980. This is

00:22.582 --> 00:25.086
Terry Anderson. This is a test.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.256
Testing, testing.

00:38.980 --> 00:44.206
This is an interview with Brigadier General 
Ogborn Duke Butler. Today is July 23, 1980. This is

00:46.068 --> 00:47.970
Terry Anderson. Now, you were born on September 
29, 1918, in Orange, Texas. Let's first talk about

00:53.196 --> 00:55.338
your upbringing. Can you tell us about your 
parents, your father's occupation? Sure. My

01:02.207 --> 01:07.393
father and mother both originated in Smith County 
near Crook, Texas.

01:09.896 --> 01:23.333
He after finishing high school became engaged in 
accounting

01:09.896 --> 01:23.333
for some lumber firms. After he and my mother 
married they went to Louisiana to work with people

01:29.772 --> 01:52.797
in the turpentine industry and later on then moved 
to Orange County where he was engaged in the lumber

01:29.772 --> 01:52.797
business with three different sawmills and a box 
factory. This business failed in 1929. He used his

01:56.501 --> 01:59.644
skills in accounting and knowledge of real estate 
to obtain a position with the Tax Assessor

02:00.637 --> 02:12.187
Collector of Orange County, where he was Chief 
Deputy. Later, upon retirement of Mr. Charles

02:12.207 --> 02:29.682
Cottle, the Tax Assessor Collector, he ran for the 
office and then for more than 20 years he was

02:12.207 --> 02:29.682
re-elected, usually had no opponent. He was the 
tax assessor collector for Orange County. Your

02:35.436 --> 02:38.238
father was a tax assessor collector? Yes, he was. 
He held that office when he died of a heart attack at

02:40.460 --> 02:50.349
age 61 in 1948 on a deer hunt up in Hill Country, 
Texas.

02:53.792 --> 02:55.193
Could you tell us about your mother? My mother was a 
jarvish.

03:03.479 --> 03:09.225
Jarvis family was an extremely prolific one over 
in East Texas. I believe that

03:09.825 --> 03:19.415
her father had 17 brothers and sisters. Some of 
them had brothers. So I'm a distant relative who

03:24.260 --> 03:28.784
seems like half the people over in East Texas. On 
the Jarvis side of the family, Her

03:33.010 --> 03:44.044
father was also engaged in business and worked 
with the packing industry. Later, he migrated to

03:44.104 --> 03:51.193
Fort Worth and worked in office management for the 
packing industry. Retired in Fort Worth. My

03:58.042 --> 03:59.384
mother is still living. She's 92. years old and 
still active. She lives with her sister in Dallas,

04:05.174 --> 04:16.589
Texas, not very far from my sister up in northeast 
Dallas. How many siblings did you have? Well I had

04:18.651 --> 04:21.475
two brothers and a sister.

04:24.419 --> 04:27.503
My sister was five years older My brother, older 
brother two years older who came to Texas A&M the

04:28.630 --> 04:41.448
same year I did and we graduated together from 
Texas A&M and then a younger brother who was class

04:28.630 --> 04:41.448
of 1945. That class of course got called into the 
service prior to their graduation. He did

04:53.774 --> 05:08.348
get his commission and was serving as a second 
lieutenant platoon leader and was killed in

04:53.774 --> 05:08.348
action in France in December of 1944. During the

05:10.330 --> 05:15.656
Battle of the Bulge? Well it was, yes, his 
division, the 45th division I believe it was,

05:21.837 --> 05:34.911
arrived during the Battle of the Bulge and they 
were committed piecemeal in southern France.

05:37.653 --> 05:47.043
So it was during that December period with the 
stress of the Battle of the Bulge that the infantry

05:37.653 --> 05:47.043
got committed even before their artillery got 
there. It was probably a rash young second

05:51.149 --> 05:56.837
lieutenant leading his battalion, got killed by a 
sniper, we were told. First week he was in combat.

06:02.746 --> 06:05.771
Concerning your parents, could you sort of 
describe them? What type of people were they?

06:09.336 --> 06:19.030
Well, I'd say that they were hard-working, very 
frugal, conservative,

06:09.336 --> 06:19.030
Anglo-Saxon Protestant. people, kind of old 
south type from over in East Texas.

06:26.900 --> 06:41.616
My father's father

06:26.900 --> 06:41.616
died fairly young also and he was a butcher in 
Troop, Texas.

06:42.256 --> 06:43.718
My father's mother grandmother on my father's 
side continued to reside in troop with one of her

06:44.238 --> 06:52.447
daughters. So as a kid we used to visit them fairly 
often. That is once or twice a year. When did your

07:01.456 --> 07:03.519
relatives first come to Texas? Gee I don't know 
that. Most Texans know that immediately. I have a

07:14.680 --> 07:20.546
couple of friends in the history department now on 
this company that have their original land grant

07:14.680 --> 07:20.546
from Mexico. Quite proud of it. What do you mean by 
the fact that your parents were conservative?

07:28.535 --> 07:42.230
Well,

07:28.535 --> 07:42.230
maybe I should say that they were thrifty on the one 
side, and that was, I guess, as much by necessity as

07:28.535 --> 07:42.230
otherwise. We never had very much money. but they 
of course were homeowners and they were

07:45.055 --> 08:05.019
for I might say God, country, the basic things that 
made America great.

08:08.343 --> 08:12.548
Do you think that your father's political career 
had much effect on you?

08:15.717 --> 08:20.782
Well, I guess it might have made me a little bit 
cynical early about politics. Sometime when he

08:21.063 --> 08:35.258
ran for office, I got exposed early to

08:21.063 --> 08:35.258
the business of politics related to innuendos and 
untruths and campaigning and all that bit. Of

08:35.278 --> 08:43.327
course, it has given me a kind of a cynical attitude 
about politics, all right.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.589
Okay, what religion, What religion, obviously, 
then was important in your upbringing? What

08:49.147 --> 08:50.669
religion was it? Well, it's very strange that my 
mother was a Baptist and attended the First

08:50.689 --> 08:58.239
Baptist Church. My father was a leader in the First 
Methodist Church in Orange. These churches were

09:05.208 --> 09:09.094
only a couple of blocks apart. We attended church 
regularly, but During the time, of course, my

09:12.535 --> 09:18.661
mother was busy with the children. My father took 
the older children to church, so it happened that

09:18.681 --> 09:29.653
she was the only Baptist, turned out to be the only 
Baptist in the family, and all of the children were

09:18.681 --> 09:29.653
raised in the Methodist church. That is unusual. 
Now, were there episodes in your early life that

09:33.056 --> 09:39.403
you think might have some influence on your future 
success?

09:43.501 --> 09:49.608
Well of course my father was a very hard-working 
man, loved the land. We lived in a suburban area in

09:51.530 --> 10:01.021
Orange County where we had livestock, had horses 
and cattle all my life. We also

10:02.804 --> 10:09.171
were fairly large in the vegetable production, 
that is, for just a family type operation. We would

10:14.551 --> 10:34.382
farm about 10 acres for vegetables, much of it hand 
labor, which my father and the boys would do early

10:14.551 --> 10:34.382
in the morning a lot of times, daylight before 
you'd go to work at 8 o'clock, and we'd go to school.

10:35.023 --> 10:36.846
Of course, we were engaged in that on and I'm sure 
that early on I developed a real strong interest in

10:38.277 --> 10:53.555
livestock, not only with our own but with other 
livestock producers in Orange County. My uncle,

10:54.817 --> 11:03.347
my mother's brother was there and an employee of 
the local meat packing company. So I used to go with

11:03.367 --> 11:07.272
him some out to the little meat packing company. I 
think that was contributed to the early interest I

11:09.057 --> 11:14.522
had in the meats business. I was going to ask you 
about how you became interested in animal

11:16.424 --> 11:19.587
science. Now as far as your parents are concerned, 
it's obvious that you've had a very successful

11:21.409 --> 11:27.735
career. What ways do you think that your parents 
are responsible for that? Well, I think they're

11:33.660 --> 11:38.845
very much responsible for it. developing high 
standards of performance in school all right from

11:40.310 --> 12:09.355
the start, elementary school to high school, and 
then encouraging responsibility and insisting

11:40.310 --> 12:09.355
on responsibility all along related to our 
livestock business, our little farming

11:40.310 --> 12:09.355
enterprises. that sort of thing.

12:15.683 --> 12:17.064
Can we shift to your early education? Pardon? Can 
we shift now to your early education? Could you

12:20.408 --> 12:22.290
tell me about your early education?

12:25.853 --> 12:39.747
Well the rural schools in Orange County in those 
days were not very good so my father paid tuition

12:25.853 --> 12:39.747
for all of his children to attend schools in town. 
He would drop the kids off at elementary school or

12:43.506 --> 12:50.133
high school on his way to work. Early on after we 
became older we'd ride bicycles along the way. Now

12:57.640 --> 13:01.664
was this to attend private schools or the public 
schools in town? Public schools in town as uh

13:01.684 --> 13:07.590
instead of attending

13:09.578 --> 13:14.384
rural school in those days in our district where we 
lived.

13:17.347 --> 13:29.521
And all of the children in our family had real fine 
records in elementary, high school, in Orange

13:17.347 --> 13:29.521
County. What were your favorite subjects? Well, I 
guess math, biology, not history.

13:45.590 --> 13:57.426
It's kind of funny though, isn't it, that you 
describe your parents as being patriotic, yet

13:45.590 --> 13:57.426
you're not interested in American history. Well, 
I'm interested. I would not say I'm uninterested,

13:59.549 --> 14:15.411
but I guess I was active outside with livestock, 
with sports and other things, and

13:59.549 --> 14:15.411
I guess was not inspired with all the time it took to 
read and study history. That's really the basic

14:22.422 --> 14:25.567
reason I thought. Never have been uninterested in 
it but just haven't been as inspired with that as

14:25.587 --> 14:32.800
some other subjects. Of course we had vocational 
agriculture in high school and I took all of that

14:32.820 --> 14:40.453
and was influenced some by the teacher of 
vocational agriculture, there's no question

14:41.750 --> 14:47.898
that he's the one that was a former student of Texas 
A&M. Oh really, what was his name? His name was

14:49.340 --> 14:52.284
Garden Hart, H-A-R-T.

14:57.411 --> 15:10.288
He actually is the one that inspired me to enroll in 
agricultural engineering, that's what his

14:57.411 --> 15:10.288
degree was in, as well as vocational. education or 
agricultural education. So oddly enough, I

15:15.914 --> 15:19.659
started out at Texas A&M as an engineer. An 
agricultural engineer. That was my initial

15:22.303 --> 15:24.465
major. Oh, we're going to get to A&M in a minute. 
Let's stay back here. How about high school? What

15:29.852 --> 15:30.994
high school did you go to? To Orange High School. 
There was just one high school in the city. And your

15:37.663 --> 15:40.326
favorite subjects then were still biology and 
Mathematics, English, biology and vocational

15:41.268 --> 15:49.077
agriculture. What kind of student were you? Well I 
had very acceptable grades. I don't know, over 90

15:57.747 --> 16:03.133
average in high school. But actually I'd have to 
say not a whole lot of effort.

16:10.850 --> 16:17.798
I had a very strange kind of an ambition. That is 
that I'd get all the way through high school and

16:17.818 --> 16:21.503
never take a book home. So we had study hall 
periods. I did all of the work required for

16:27.209 --> 16:37.161
homework and everything in study halls in high 
school.

16:37.833 --> 16:43.541
I actually double promoted three times along the 
way and the last time didn't work. I don't remember

16:43.641 --> 16:47.626
exactly what grade it was in, maybe about fifth 
grade. I remember when I double promoted I got in

16:47.807 --> 16:59.903
that class and it was way over my head and I resisted 
that and so I was put back. So actually I skipped one

16:59.983 --> 17:02.727
grade. But at this time, correct me if I'm wrong, 
didn't schools, you were promoted half grades at a

17:03.500 --> 17:09.927
time? Half grades, sure. So I actually graduated 
from high school at age 16. A year early then? A year

17:16.814 --> 17:17.554
early. Of course there were only 11 grades in the 
public schools then. So I got a degree, a high

17:24.361 --> 17:29.727
school diploma at age 16. Oh that's strong. What 
activities were you interested in or

17:32.440 --> 17:37.187
participated in in high school? I participated in 
the sports activities and then the activities

17:37.207 --> 17:46.081
related to vocational agriculture. The 4-H? Not 
4-H, FFA.

17:55.238 --> 18:07.736
So I did in high school during vacation period work 
with the county agricultural agent and mapping

17:55.238 --> 18:07.736
farms around county one year. So I did get exposed 
to the county extension agent in Orange County

18:07.756 --> 18:15.748
during my career. What sports? Primarily 
basketball. I was a little fella. I did later in

18:20.895 --> 18:22.798
football. I was like a hundred and twenty-five, 
thirty pound halfback. Not very good, but I did

18:29.548 --> 18:33.633
later in football. Did your head get stepped on 
quite a few times?

18:39.780 --> 18:42.182
Yeah. I was associated with the famous Hilliard 
family in Arnie County, the youngest one of those

18:42.202 --> 18:49.731
Hilliards. was a teammate on football. He never 
made it quite as big in the University of Texas as

18:54.586 --> 19:04.358
his older brothers did, who were very famous 
football players for the University of Texas. In

19:06.521 --> 19:13.670
the F and the Future Farmers of America, did you 
participate in any leadership positions? Yes. I

19:17.909 --> 19:20.933
was an officer in the FFA chapter. I've forgotten 
exactly which one of the officer positions I held.

19:29.803 --> 19:40.436
I did participate in judging activities, made a 
team that went to the Houston livestock show.

19:40.896 --> 19:43.379
Really? We didn't. do any good in the state judging 
contests,

19:45.584 --> 20:02.379
but through basketball and FFA activities I was, I 
did travel around to the other communities in that

19:45.584 --> 20:02.379
district.

20:04.901 --> 20:13.549
So it seems then that you were, that you started a 
position of leadership or responsibility fairly

20:04.901 --> 20:13.549
early in life. Do you agree with that or disagree? 
Well I'd say that I certainly wasn't a very

20:18.965 --> 20:27.318
dominant leader in high school times. Well can you 
explain that? Well I was younger, a year younger

20:31.625 --> 20:39.638
than most of my classmates and while I 
participated in things

20:41.305 --> 20:49.097
I wasn't good enough at sports to be dominant at 
all. I got academic recognition along in the

20:49.117 --> 20:54.746
classes. I'd say it's kind of an average career in 
high school. Would you consider yourself popular

21:01.016 --> 21:04.942
in high school? I guess so.

21:08.587 --> 21:09.068
Okay. You graduated at the age of 16 and this was 
right in the middle of the depression, wasn't it?

21:19.449 --> 21:20.631
Yeah, is it over?

21:25.517 --> 21:30.103
How did the Great Depression affect your life and 
your family's lives? Well it was very traumatic in

21:31.985 --> 21:39.915
1929 when my father went broke lumber business and 
box factory business.

21:49.061 --> 22:10.290
He elected not to take bankruptcy but to pay off his 
debts so that was a burden on our family for years

21:49.061 --> 22:10.290
for him to pay off the debts that had been incurred 
with his business failure.

22:12.413 --> 22:13.875
I don't think it hurt us at all. We did learn to 
sacrifice, never lag for food. We certainly were

22:21.965 --> 22:37.645
not extravagant in clothing at all or in 
entertainment, but that's the way all our peers

22:21.965 --> 22:37.645
were too, so we didn't know anybody. And I'm 
certain that some sacrifices along there helped

22:39.667 --> 22:47.535
demold character for my brothers and me. We knew 
what it was to be denied things. Yeah, yeah. Would

22:53.241 --> 22:59.367
you think that this has an increased possibility 
of making you want to save money, or? I'm not sure

22:59.768 --> 23:02.791
what your thoughts, but. There's no question that 
that certainly made me conservative about

23:02.891 --> 23:08.577
financial matters. It seemed to have 
approximately the same effect on my father.

23:19.679 --> 23:29.492
Were any of your, what was your older brother for 
example, did he join the CCC's or any New Deal

23:19.679 --> 23:29.492
programs? Did you benefit in any way from any New 
Deal programs? No. My sister was an outstanding

23:37.227 --> 23:41.773
student in high school. My brother had about the 
same kind of high school record I had. When he

23:49.903 --> 23:52.486
graduated from high school, he went to work. Both 
my sister and my brother worked at a casket factory

23:54.609 --> 24:00.096
in Orange.

24:06.269 --> 24:17.242
So we were making it on our own without any kind of 
subsidy program

24:06.269 --> 24:17.242
at all. Was one of the reasons your father went into 
politics because of the 1929 crash and the fact

24:17.262 --> 24:25.412
that it had on his job? Well, there's no question 
about that, that when his business failed, he

24:25.432 --> 24:34.302
looked for an opportunity to use his accounting 
and business skills and his knowledge of real

24:35.378 --> 24:37.521
estate.

24:40.727 --> 24:47.057
And of course the opportunity was there to be Chief 
Deputy Tax Assessor Collector. He had of course

24:47.518 --> 24:59.597
established contact with that office and his 
lumber dealings around and leasing land for

24:47.518 --> 24:59.597
timber and purchase of land and that sort of thing. 
It was a sort of a natural relationship to the job he

25:00.742 --> 25:13.778
had done since timber was so important in Orange 
County area at that time. Did the depression have

25:15.760 --> 25:18.924
an effect not only on your father but on your 
mother?

25:22.228 --> 25:24.631
Well mother was a homebody. Her social life was 
around the church and our relatives, her brother

25:32.517 --> 25:43.089
and his wife that also lived in Orange County.

25:46.473 --> 25:59.908
I would say that she was such a conservative person 
along there that for instance she never learned to

25:46.473 --> 25:59.908
drive an automobile in her whole life.

26:01.998 --> 26:04.742
Why was that? Can you explain that? I think she was a 
retiring homemaker type. She stayed home, took

26:10.890 --> 26:18.120
care of the kids, did the cooking and chores like 
that that homemakers were expected to do. She

26:18.140 --> 26:19.242
never had to learn. She was an intelligent woman, 
but my father was a pretty dominant kind of a

26:20.804 --> 26:27.172
fellow. He pretty well made the decisions related 
to the family all right.

26:33.183 --> 26:35.446
early on. She

26:35.706 --> 26:47.139
didn't go anywhere much that he didn't go so she 
didn't need to be able to drive an automobile.

26:48.280 --> 26:55.689
There weren't any automobiles when she was a young 
girl when she would normally would have learned to

26:48.280 --> 26:55.689
drive which she just never did. Learned to drive 
and just never to this day. Was your father a

27:02.562 --> 27:04.784
Democrat? Yes, he was. And was he a Roosevelt man? 
Well, I would say that he was not a blind supporter

27:12.091 --> 27:19.879
of the Democratic Party. I think he liked certain 
aspects of the Roosevelt regime, but was not

27:21.901 --> 27:32.451
fascinated with other aspects. welfare part of 
it, the socialistic part of it, he was not

27:33.258 --> 27:38.707
fascinated with at all. He couldn't stomach Al 
Smith, so I'm sure when Al Smith ran for

27:40.329 --> 27:50.085
presidency, he didn't vote for Al Smith or support 
him, so I would say that In certain ways, he was an

27:51.382 --> 28:00.234
independent, but he always ran on the Democratic 
ticket, because everybody else did in Texas

27:51.382 --> 28:00.234
during that period. Absolutely, absolutely. Did 
his politics and his being a member of the

28:02.738 --> 28:12.812
Democratic Party have an influence on your future 
politics?

28:15.736 --> 28:16.958
No, I don't think so. He's good. help us to analyze 
issues and support people rather than parties. So

28:27.623 --> 28:41.001
he did not try to influence us, any of the children, 
to be party members, but to be rather independent

28:27.623 --> 28:41.001
thinkers. And I suspect that's what our people, 
all of our family members are without being

28:41.021 --> 28:48.912
committed to one political party or another. But 
he talked issues with his sons? Oh no question,

28:53.331 --> 28:55.496
sure. I bet you that was stimulating. He was a fine 
companion to his sons. He was an ardent hunter and

29:01.648 --> 29:08.522
fisherman, so he took us hunting and fishing very 
often. Spent a lot of time with his sons.

29:13.057 --> 29:23.153
and of course a lot of time working too, that is 
outside of his office hours and with our livestock

29:13.057 --> 29:23.153
and with our truck farming operations. But all the 
colleges in Texas and in the nation, why'd you come

29:23.173 --> 29:29.262
to A&M? Was it because of your high school teacher 
primarily? Or were there other reasons? Well, we

29:37.816 --> 29:38.777
were

29:41.896 --> 29:44.920
inclined some toward agriculture.

29:48.705 --> 29:56.955
A big thing in our county during those days was for 
people to come to the Farm at Home Week at Texas A&M.

30:00.119 --> 30:06.827
So many of my friends and their families would come 
here. We had a lot of activities related to home

30:12.305 --> 30:20.513
demonstration agents and county agents, food 
preservation, canning, things like that. So

30:20.613 --> 30:31.404
Texas A&M was just an extremely dominant type 
association in the county. And certainly we

30:31.424 --> 30:38.110
didn't have any wide acquaintanceship with other 
universities. I suppose we never even seriously

30:39.575 --> 30:44.182
considered any other institution. You never 
considered an alternative like LSU or? Oh no,

30:49.169 --> 30:51.773
think about a state. Tuition probably. That's 
right, of course Lamar State University, Lamar,

30:53.656 --> 31:03.270
we were just getting started in Beaumont, 
Jefferson County.

31:04.904 --> 31:11.213
a reputation that was anywhere comparable to 
Texas A&M. Of course, the two universities in our

31:13.437 --> 31:20.848
county that were real dominant were Texas A&M and 
the University of Texas. The dominant wealthy

31:20.868 --> 31:26.516
people in the county were supporters of the 
University of Texas. Orange had a real strong

31:27.398 --> 31:34.388
orientation toward the University of Texas. H.J. 
Ledger Stark was one of the major supporters of the

31:35.909 --> 31:41.735
University of Texas financially. We had a number 
of varsity football players.

31:48.842 --> 31:58.051
But I'm sure that the primary influence I had were 
from the county extension agent and the

31:48.842 --> 31:58.051
vocational teacher, the teacher of vocational 
agriculture. Both good Texas Aggies. plus the

32:01.317 --> 32:09.632
fact that you enjoyed working with the animals on 
your small spread. Yes, that's right. Did your

32:12.497 --> 32:14.300
father boost education? He had a high school 
degree.
