00:02.748 --> 00:28.603
okay eddie was extension veterinarian now this 
was about 1945 am i wrong that was uh that was uh in

00:02.748 --> 00:28.603
the let me see uh yes uh eddie left here about the 
first of september of 45 and i went into that office

00:02.748 --> 00:28.603
about you know i they they uh they hired i was still 
in the service And I thought, well, if I can get a job

00:29.360 --> 00:34.908
like that, that'll help me to get out of the 
service. But let me see. In May of 45, Jack Heaton

00:38.492 --> 00:44.500
and I had opened our office out here. We were still 
in the service. The old colonel said it was all

00:46.263 --> 00:48.165
right with him. Somebody says, well, if they find 
out about that in Washington, they'll transfer

00:48.226 --> 00:54.754
you clear out of this country. Well, we said, we've 
been here too long anyway. We started that

00:58.807 --> 01:03.473
practice, and one of us needed to get out of the 
service to get out there to it. So I thought, well,

01:04.674 --> 01:09.260
if I can get that job as state veterinarian, I'll be 
here close to it. So I took that job that Eddie had,

01:09.581 --> 01:13.966
and I was there for a year. Let me ask you this. Back 
in those days, was the state veterinarian really a

01:18.532 --> 01:25.440
state veterinarian back then or not?

01:26.982 --> 01:28.324
They had... They had a

01:29.620 --> 01:40.412
lot of authority and a lot of power.

01:43.075 --> 01:57.791
In fact,

01:43.075 --> 01:57.791
I used my power in reverse in many instances where I 
didn't think it was necessary to quarantine a herd

01:43.075 --> 01:57.791
or take some kind of action. Well, I helped Yeah, 
for instance,

01:59.422 --> 02:12.493
in

01:59.422 --> 02:12.493
the fall of 45, there were some Brahma Bulls. You 
may know about this. The Mexicans down there on the

02:14.856 --> 02:20.741
border, what were their names? The Garas? What? 
The Garas. Garas. Garas, that's the one. They

02:26.646 --> 02:27.927
brought those... those red bremas in from Brazil. 
Now, when they left Brazil, they were Brazilian

02:33.476 --> 02:37.962
bulls. They got into Mexico, they were Mexican 
bulls. They came across the border into Texas.

02:44.610 --> 02:47.894
When they got over here, they reverted back to 
Brazilian bulls. Well, we needed that blood. We

02:51.158 --> 02:55.703
needed that blood, you know.

02:57.809 --> 02:58.690
We didn't know about it. We didn't know about it 
until the following April. In April of 46, Francis

03:02.115 --> 03:15.433
and I were in Hermosillo, Mexico, at a U.S. and 
Mexico sanitary meeting. And somebody told me

03:15.454 --> 03:19.840
that we had some Brazilian bulls in Texas. What are 
you going to do about it? I says, I don't know until I

03:21.462 --> 03:22.764
get home. I came home. Those bulls had been in 
contact with those highly susceptible cattle

03:26.868 --> 03:38.139
from here for six months. I said, what are you going 
to do with these bulls? They said, we're not going

03:42.042 --> 03:43.604
to do anything with them. We're going to keep them 
right here. I says, if you'll keep those bulls

03:44.825 --> 03:53.533
right here, we're going to have somebody examine 
them every 30 days, and if anything goes wrong that

03:54.003 --> 04:00.914
if you have any sickness or it looks like you might 
have some trouble, you contact me and we'll be glad

03:54.003 --> 04:00.914
to. Well, we... What were you looking for? Well, 
the first problem that jumped up, the Midwestern

04:07.926 --> 04:21.107
states started raising sound about us having 
those Brazilian bulls down here. You're talking

04:22.859 --> 04:25.582
about the U.S. Livestock Sanitary Commission. 
Well, those people were all members of the U.S.

04:25.602 --> 04:34.692
Sanitary Commission, U.S. Livestock Sanitary. 
But they had a little organization of their own

04:34.712 --> 04:49.508
group up there in the Midwest, in Kansas and 
Nebraska and one or two other states. And they were

04:50.551 --> 04:52.834
going to have a meeting up there about this. So I got 
on an

04:53.275 --> 05:03.290
airplane and flew up there. And they were going to 
quarantine. They were going to embargo against

05:06.474 --> 05:08.397
Texas. Well, I told them what had happened and how I 
felt about it and how we were keeping them under

05:08.938 --> 05:16.870
observation. They said, well, that's all right. 
That's all right. We think you've got the thing

05:20.291 --> 05:21.853
under control. So I come on back home. Wasn't a week 
later that the Florida people started. We're

05:28.143 --> 05:30.107
going to embargo against Texas cattle. They've 
got those Brazilian bulls over there. I jump on an

05:32.771 --> 05:42.647
airplane and fly down to Lake Okeechobee and went 
into that little old hotel down there and heard a

05:32.771 --> 05:42.647
couple of fellas talking and Yeah, there's a whole 
delegation of those so-and-sos coming over here,

05:43.522 --> 05:47.767
but we're going to quarantine their cattle. Man, I 
didn't sleep very good that night. I thought,

05:49.650 --> 05:51.532
well, I'm that delegation. We got up the next 
morning and went down to this meeting of the

05:52.353 --> 05:56.878
commission. They were meeting at the courthouse 
there. And they were discussing a little fever

05:59.922 --> 06:06.650
tick outbreak that they had down there, you know, 
coming out of the Everglades. I don't know whether

06:06.670 --> 06:12.077
they still got them or not, but every so often those 
deer and whatnot will come out of the Everglades

06:12.310 --> 06:40.157
and bring those old fever ticks and they have to 
fight them back you know and they were talking

06:12.310 --> 06:40.157
about how they were handling that situation and I 
said I see they came to me and I got up and I said well I

06:12.310 --> 06:40.157
see you this fever tick situation over you people 
have got problems over here too but I said we're not

06:12.310 --> 06:40.157
worried in Texas we we feel like you'll take care of 
it all right and then I went into details of what we

06:40.424 --> 07:04.474
had done and what we had and how we were handling it 
and they said well we think that's all right we

06:40.424 --> 07:04.474
think you can handle your your problems in Texas 
too so we broke up here comes an old boy running down

06:40.424 --> 07:04.474
there and said shook hands with me and says boy you 
sure did a good job I said what do you mean he says

06:40.424 --> 07:04.474
getting this thing straightened out said you know 
If we'd have got that embargo against you, we'd

07:07.222 --> 07:12.969
have sure had a good sale of brame of bulls here in 
Florida. He was just laughing about it. So a lot of

07:15.372 --> 07:20.999
those things, a lot of those embargoes are just 
economic things, see, for economic reasons. But

07:21.059 --> 07:36.098
the livestock, I got the general impression that 
all the, that

07:21.059 --> 07:36.098
the Livestock Sanitary Commission didn't 
necessarily promulgate their rules on the basis

07:21.059 --> 07:36.098
of good veterinary medicine and quarantines and

07:36.348 --> 07:52.955
from the basis of good practice in the shipment of 
cattle, but they were merely there to kind of help

07:36.348 --> 07:52.955
keep the rest of the country off the Texas bag. Is 
that right? Oh, I see your point. That's exactly

07:56.742 --> 07:58.004
right. That's exactly right. And people... You 
know, we had some good feeder cattle down here. We

08:04.613 --> 08:18.774
export a lot more cattle than we use, and we have to 
constantly be on guard to keep somebody from

08:04.613 --> 08:18.774
quarantining against us. Oh, yeah, yeah. And a lot 
of your regulatory laws are simply economic

08:20.296 --> 08:28.528
embargo-type things, you know. The Livestock 
Sanitary Commission was more in Oregon at that

08:28.745 --> 08:41.745
time to keep the livestock industry in good stead 
with the rest of the country. Isn't that correct?

08:43.528 --> 08:46.333
More necessarily than to prevent the spread of 
disease. Well, I'd go to a U.S. livestock meeting,

08:46.393 --> 08:54.165
and I had to be ready to answer questions. I 
remember old... The old doctor, the old

08:56.369 --> 09:02.857
veterinarian from Montana, I don't remember his 
name now, but he got up one day. No, it was before

09:03.438 --> 09:04.440
him. He got up one day in the meeting, and he says, I 
would like to know what the states of the

09:06.362 --> 09:26.308
anaplasmosis states,

09:06.362 --> 09:26.308
namely Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and 
Florida, are doing to control... Anaplasmosis.

09:31.624 --> 09:34.669
And I thought, good gosh, how am I going to handle 
that? I was going to say, that was a pretty tough

09:34.689 --> 09:36.872
question. How am I going to handle that? Well, this 
old veterinarian from Arkansas, what was his

09:38.935 --> 09:45.846
name? Well, anyway, he jumped up and says, I don't 
know what these other states are doing, but

09:50.470 --> 09:52.232
Arkansas ain't doing a damn thing. If you'll tell 
us something to do, we'll do it. Old man just sat

09:54.275 --> 09:58.641
down.

10:00.263 --> 10:00.764
Oh, yes.

10:03.588 --> 10:04.309
But you know what?

10:09.175 --> 10:14.282
We're still having to fight that battle.

10:14.302 --> 10:16.545
Why do we have an enormous... expenditure of money 
for brucellosis eradication in Texas to appease

10:16.947 --> 10:23.634
these other states. We can handle our business 
down here. Now, wait a minute. Let's cut that

10:28.198 --> 10:29.479
machine. Let me ask you another question now 
before I run this over you. Then we can turn it off

10:32.883 --> 10:35.365
and get on with what you want to say. I, for years, 
carried a tremendous brucellosis titer, which

10:35.385 --> 10:42.212
helped me out. But We had a lot of people, 
especially up in Minnesota, that got sick with it.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.516
And there wasn't much you could do for it back in 
those days. And there isn't too much more you can do

10:49.536 --> 10:51.278
about it now. Don't you think the public health 
people are going to keep the heat on? If you can

10:55.101 --> 11:04.570
segregate public health people from veterinary 
health people, don't you think they're going to

10:55.101 --> 11:04.570
really put the heat on to continue to work on that?

11:07.713 --> 11:11.997
They have been for, well, when did we start playing 
with that. 54, wasn't it? Yeah, that was earlier

11:14.115 --> 11:16.137
than that, really. Yeah, yeah, but we had those 
meetings down in Austin over 30 years ago. Yes. And

11:24.707 --> 11:41.646
these...

11:24.707 --> 11:41.646
these...

11:24.707 --> 11:41.646
the USDA will continue to... put pressure on 
because they spent two billion dollars and and we

11:42.250 --> 12:11.262
haven't got a whole lot to show for it but they're 
gonna have to continue spending a lot of money on it

11:42.250 --> 12:11.262
I guess I don't know I'm not too worried about it I 
don't think that I don't think that the government

11:42.250 --> 12:11.262
ought to pay me to vaccinate calves But as long as 
they do it, I'm going to take that money and just lay

12:11.596 --> 12:15.760
it and go on. OK. Dan, I'm sure you weren't out of 
school very long before you became somewhat

12:15.780 --> 12:34.299
involved in what we call organized veterinary 
medicine associations, the AVMA and TVMA and so

12:15.780 --> 12:34.299
forth, and probably belonged to the junior AVMA in 
school and belonged to the AVMA and the Texas

12:15.780 --> 12:34.299
Veterinary Medical Association. Looking back on 
it, I'd like to have you give little bit of a summary

12:41.903 --> 13:09.565
of what associations can do for a veterinarian 
specifically and also what their value is to the

12:41.903 --> 13:09.565
general public

12:41.903 --> 13:09.565
if you can say the two are different of course well 
associations

12:41.903 --> 13:09.565
are

12:41.903 --> 13:09.565
in a position to do much more than an individual 
could do in raising the standards of a profession

13:10.709 --> 13:29.446
or in changing the rules and regulations or 
whatnot. The association does so much that the

13:29.466 --> 13:39.535
individual couldn't even attempt to do and when 
you bring association matters before a group of

13:40.409 --> 14:06.839
individuals that are dedicated and capable and

13:40.409 --> 14:06.839
really desiring to come up with the right answers, 
they can do so much more for the group than an

13:40.409 --> 14:06.839
individual can. And so I know that that the 
veterinary profession

14:10.970 --> 14:21.024
could never be where it is today without our 
association. What do you feel in the Texas

14:21.044 --> 14:23.668
Veterinary Medical Association? Have there been 
any so-called milestones, or do you feel it's just

14:23.708 --> 14:33.782
kind of grown steadily through the years in 
effectiveness and in its scope? We've had our ups

14:34.243 --> 14:39.610
and downs all down through the years. the last 40 or 
50 years uh but uh when uh when i was a student yes i

14:39.843 --> 15:02.492
belonged to the student chapter of avma and then 
that's one thing that old dr marstella i think uh i

14:39.843 --> 15:02.492
can give him a lot of credit for that he he made me 
feel like that that uh there were there were two

14:39.843 --> 15:02.492
things that were a must. I must pass the state 
board, and I must belong to the state association

15:04.045 --> 15:09.932
and to the AVMA. It was just

15:11.153 --> 15:30.977
my understanding that that is the thing that you 
didn't think about doing anything else but

15:11.153 --> 15:30.977
belonging and contributing in a small way when the 
occasion arose.

15:33.185 --> 15:53.226
I just feel that

15:33.185 --> 15:53.226
so many people don't stop to think

15:33.185 --> 15:53.226
how much better off we are today through organized 
veterinary medicine.

15:56.210 --> 16:03.057
I'd like to ask you a general question and then a 
specific question, some specific steps to that.

16:04.420 --> 16:17.356
You know, the Federal Trade Commission has kind of 
gotten after the professions lately, the dental

16:04.420 --> 16:17.356
profession, the medical profession, and the 
veterinary profession also, regarding their

16:04.420 --> 16:17.356
monopolistic trade practices and so forth. And 
they've kind of gone a little bit hard on so-called

16:18.338 --> 16:29.992
the rules of practice promulgated by the 
political arms known as the examining boards. Do

16:31.695 --> 16:33.617
you feel there's a happy medium in that? Do you feel 
pressures from both sides? I can see where the

16:39.318 --> 16:42.308
participants want to bring it.
