00:02.782 --> 00:10.594
It's had a very positive effect on my lifestyle.

00:13.017 --> 00:21.330
The three years that I served in the chancellor's 
office, actually 33 months as chancellor plus Oh,

00:21.631 --> 00:44.801
four months after that, as an executive assistant

00:21.631 --> 00:44.801
to the new chancellor,

00:21.631 --> 00:44.801
to give me an opportunity to finish up the master 
plan for the A&M Research Park, which I had

00:21.631 --> 00:44.801
started. That was Bum Bright's idea as chairman of 
the board. And the

00:50.723 --> 01:15.310
three years there so vastly improved my, the 
formula considerations which determined my

00:50.723 --> 01:15.310
retirement income were substantial, Haskell. 
And that's had a profound impact upon our life.

01:20.474 --> 01:21.716
Okay, the last question. What feelings do you hold 
in your heart for A&M today?

01:38.979 --> 01:45.267
Well, they are of course feelings of great 
respect.

01:47.626 --> 02:10.836
feelings of,

01:47.626 --> 02:10.836
at this point following the bonfire incident just 
so recently, that has had a profound impact upon me

01:47.626 --> 02:10.836
and upon everybody, Haskell. And I have not been 
exempt from that. from the impact that that left

02:15.537 --> 02:18.100
upon me. To me I hope this university learns that an

02:20.723 --> 02:42.608
institution which prizes its self-made 
traditions above human life is destined for

02:20.723 --> 02:42.608
something other than greatness.

02:46.655 --> 02:59.626
I

02:46.655 --> 02:59.626
feel close

02:46.655 --> 02:59.626
to the university. I feel the university

02:59.726 --> 03:16.020
simply needs to be truly a major university in its 
stature and its poise among its administrative

02:59.726 --> 03:16.020
leadership. people

03:16.743 --> 03:36.163
among the faculty, all the constituents, the 
Farmer Students Association.

03:36.183 --> 03:40.708
I have strong, strong feelings, positive 
feelings for A&M. If someone gave you a million

03:41.589 --> 03:45.653
dollar check with one condition on it, that you 
have to pass it on to A&M, what would you ask them to

03:45.818 --> 03:52.487
do with that resource? I would ask them to put it 
with the Texas A&M University Press as an

03:54.310 --> 04:04.404
endowment for scholarly publications.

04:04.424 --> 04:05.245
Let's quit on that.
