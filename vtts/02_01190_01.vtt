WEBVTT

00:07.321 --> 00:09.483
Could you give your full name? My name is Robert G. 
Tow. And this is June 1, Tuesday, 1993, at the

00:15.009 --> 00:24.319
University of Texas, Austin Astronomy 
Department. Where were you born, Bob? I was born in

00:26.641 --> 00:31.646
Jackson, Michigan, on May 1, 1929. When did you 
first get—how did you first get interested in

00:33.488 --> 00:37.092
astronomy? Oh, there were two or three events. I 
remember one event when I was extremely young, and

00:40.893 --> 01:00.780
I have not yet been able to identify this event, but 
there was a very heavy meteor shower, which we saw

00:40.893 --> 01:00.780
when we were driving in our old Willie's Night from 
Brooklyn to Jackson, Michigan, late one night.

01:01.041 --> 01:07.990
The meteors were coming down very heavily, almost 
straight down like a rainstorm. In later years, I

01:08.392 --> 01:19.489
thought that perhaps this was the Jacobinid 
shower of 1933, but I've more recently understood

01:08.392 --> 01:19.489
that that was not seen in the United States. A more 
recent event was the Jacobinid meteor shower of

01:20.691 --> 01:35.074
1946, but by that time I was already almost through 
high school and far along on my interest in

01:20.691 --> 01:35.074
astronomy. I had a very good view of that 
particular meteor shower. Where'd you go to

01:40.981 --> 01:44.145
undergraduate school? University of Illinois. 
First at Navy Pier and then down in Champaign. And

01:49.451 --> 01:51.494
what was your major? Physics. Physics. And when 
did you get your degree? Fifty-two. Okay. Then you

01:57.121 --> 02:00.084
went to graduate school, and where did you go? 
Well, I didn't go immediately to graduate school.

02:02.287 --> 02:03.829
I went to work for a year at the with the Signal 
Corps, U.S. Army, and then they drafted me, and I

02:04.703 --> 02:09.329
worked for two more years for them. And I went to the 
University of Illinois Graduate School for two

02:10.510 --> 02:13.334
years. Got my master's degree. At that time, there 
was no Ph.D. program at Illinois, and

02:16.398 --> 02:28.172
Stan Wyatt and...

02:16.398 --> 02:28.172
Ivan King? No, no, McVitie. McVitie. George 
McVitie advised. me to try Michigan. Therefore, I

02:36.682 --> 02:43.650
enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1957. As 
I recall, when you were still at Illinois, you

02:43.690 --> 03:00.428
already had a well-developed

02:43.690 --> 03:00.428
ability to build instruments because you built a 
plate-holding camera for the 12-inch refractor

02:43.690 --> 03:00.428
with Well,

03:00.897 --> 03:18.478
I discovered that there was a lathe and a 
rudimentary shop in the basement of that old

03:00.897 --> 03:18.478
observatory on the University of Illinois 
campus, and certainly George McVitie didn't

03:00.897 --> 03:18.478
discourage me from trying some things. In fact, 
there was one summer when I didn't have much to do,

03:19.919 --> 03:27.428
and he was going to be away from campus, and he 
suggested, well, why don't you give that old

03:28.505 --> 03:33.972
30-inch mirror sitting under the stairs to test. I 
said, okay, I'll do it. And I went ahead and built a

03:36.235 --> 03:41.543
very elaborate testing apparatus down in the shop 
there. Then I found some space in the basement of

03:42.904 --> 03:49.333
the physics building to set it up and do these 
tests. Called a truck to come over and pick up the

03:51.937 --> 03:54.500
mirror. It was still in its crate. I had not opened 
the crate yet. They came and they backed the truck

03:58.289 --> 04:07.163
up to the steps of the observatory whereupon the 
steps collapsed down into the basement.

04:10.849 --> 04:25.832
They

04:10.849 --> 04:25.832
finally did get the mirror into the truck and over 
to the physics building and we opened up the crate

04:10.849 --> 04:25.832
and the mirror had a deep radial crack from its 
center out about two-thirds of the way to the edge,

04:26.588 --> 04:31.915
and therefore was essentially useless. I did 
spend a few days just going through some

04:32.816 --> 04:36.702
rudimentary tests. However, it was something 
like a 30-inch F1.5 or F2. Was this the one where the

04:42.750 --> 04:48.978
guy in Indiana was going to use it to photograph the 
souls of the recently departed? That's exactly

04:49.058 --> 04:50.280
the one. Or is it now? Well, I don't know. As far as I 
know, it's still in the basement of the physics

04:56.980 --> 05:01.665
building. What did you do for your—when did you get 
your Ph.D. at Michigan? 63. And what was your

05:07.232 --> 05:09.114
dissertation on? It was on spectrophotometry of 
the nucleus—or the nuclear region of M-31. And who

05:16.002 --> 05:16.943
was your advisor? Bill Lilly. Oh, okay. Okay, so 
let's see, that was 60? 63. 63. Okay, then it's time

05:26.697 --> 05:29.120
to look for a job. Well, okay, yeah. In 61,

05:32.705 --> 05:52.671
Gerard de Vaucouleur and Frank Edmonds here at the 
University of Texas called and invited me to spend

05:32.705 --> 05:52.671
a few months here in Austin helping to design a 
couple of astronomical instruments. I guess they

05:53.427 --> 06:00.575
heard about me at a meeting someplace and decided 
to give me a try. Well, at that stage in my graduate

06:00.615 --> 06:08.904
studies, both I and my wife were pretty exhausted 
and we decided this is a good chance to take a break.

06:09.825 --> 06:19.435
So we spent four months here in Austin, designed a 
spectrum

06:09.825 --> 06:19.435
scanner to be used on the 82-inch telescope. And 
then on the 1st of January, 70 degrees here in

06:22.150 --> 06:28.740
Austin, we left for back home. By the time we got 
there, it was zero degrees in Michigan. And we

06:32.426 --> 06:39.657
moved back into our old environment for a few 
months, finishing up graduate work in Michigan.

06:40.518 --> 06:43.903
While I was here in Austin, Frank Edmonds and 
Gerard Vogeler invited me to join the faculty here

06:44.862 --> 06:50.190
at Texas. And when did you do that? I did that in the 
fall of 62. Okay, so how many faculty were there

06:53.775 --> 06:56.839
then? The fourth one or something like that? 
Something like that, yes. There's a photograph I

07:02.688 --> 07:04.390
think up here.

07:11.947 --> 07:22.060
Okay, Bob Tull is now unfolding a photograph of the 
five horsemen, and from left to right, they are

07:11.947 --> 07:22.060
Harlan Smith, a very young-looking juror of the 
Book of Lore, Bob Tull. Who's the other guy? This is

07:23.141 --> 07:26.245
Frank Edmonds, of course, and this is...

07:31.372 --> 07:36.939
The fifth man is Terry Deeming, who was here for a 
few years. He was primarily a mathematician, did a

07:36.999 --> 07:41.565
lot of theoretical work, And he eventually moved 
to a mathematical firm in Houston called Digicon.

07:54.095 --> 07:57.059
He passed away about two years ago. The faculty's a 
lot bigger now. Is it any better, you think? Oh, I

08:05.271 --> 08:07.654
believe so. There's a wide variety of interests in 
the faculty at the present moment, including the

08:08.258 --> 08:16.226
theoretical and the experimental. And 
observational astronomy is very strong here at

08:17.227 --> 08:22.011
the University of Texas. Well, when you got here, 
what did you do? What have they been having you do

08:25.194 --> 08:27.757
for the last 30 years? Well, my first seven years 
here, I was on the teaching faculty.

08:39.629 --> 08:59.154
About the third or fourth year, the University of 
Texas became very active in planning and building

08:39.629 --> 08:59.154
a new hundred and seven inch telescope, which Ron 
Shorn of course was instrumental in some of that

08:39.629 --> 08:59.154
early planning.

09:01.998 --> 09:06.784
Harlan Smith at one stage asked me to join the the 
project, which required me to drop one of my summer

09:07.675 --> 09:16.986
research grants. And from that point on, I was 
heavily involved in the construction of the

09:17.006 --> 09:36.349
107-inch telescope, which involved the design of 
the Coudet spectrograph, the testing of the

09:17.006 --> 09:36.349
107-inch mirror at the manufacturer Davidson 
Optronics in West Covina, California.

09:46.072 --> 09:48.695
The tests were completed in 1968. The telescope 
came together that year and the first observation

09:49.396 --> 10:03.214
was done on March 9th, the night of March 8th of 
1969.

10:03.464 --> 10:09.411
was my observation, which was a high-resolution 
spectrum of Arcturus.

10:12.455 --> 10:14.938
And what did you do after the 107-inch? After the 
107-inch, I became a member of the research staff

10:15.659 --> 10:24.851
at McDonald Observatory as what was called a 
research scientist. This was a relatively new

10:24.931 --> 10:29.877
type of position for the University of Texas. 
Eventually, the research staff of the McDonald

10:30.565 --> 10:57.366
Observatory increased as much as did the faculty, 
and at the present moment we have roughly equal

10:30.565 --> 10:57.366
numbers of faculty and research scientists,

10:30.565 --> 10:57.366
like 20 to 22 of each.

10:59.843 --> 11:18.566
During the ensuing years, I have been involved for 
part of the time in observational astronomy, but I

10:59.843 --> 11:18.566
found long ago that my interest in 
instrumentation would keep me from ever reducing

10:59.843 --> 11:18.566
this data. And I decided eventually that it was a 
waste of telescope time for me to occupy a

11:19.327 --> 11:27.977
telescope for an observing run. and then just sit 
on the data. So I gradually moved over entirely

11:30.526 --> 11:36.292
into instrumentation. There's a fellow just like 
you at the Center for Astrophysics, John Geary. Do

11:41.737 --> 11:42.097
you know him? Oh, yes. I know John Geary. I was 
drinking wine with him last morning. And you're

11:47.622 --> 11:58.892
two guys I had in mind, because whether you're 
planetary astronomers or scholar astronomers or

11:47.622 --> 11:58.892
what, we all use your stuff. And I don't think you 
guys get enough credit. Do you think you get enough

12:01.908 --> 12:03.310
credit? No, I don't.

12:09.236 --> 12:12.680
Well, I enjoy my work very much. You did a fair 
amount of work on the late, lamented 300-inch,

12:12.760 --> 12:18.847
Texas 300-inch. Yes, I did. I was the principal 
scientist, project scientist for that project.

12:25.314 --> 12:27.697
How many years did that take off your life? That was 
five years. Five years. Are you connected in any

12:30.327 --> 12:35.474
way with the SST, the Spectroscopic Survey 
Telescope? I've been asked to and I've begun doing

12:35.514 --> 12:46.668
the work to design, to oversee the design and 
construction of the high resolution

12:35.514 --> 12:46.668
spectrograph for the SST. I began that effort last 
fall with an

12:47.969 --> 12:58.663
international conference which I organized and 
which was held entirely by email. has involved not

12:59.943 --> 13:18.367
only the international partners of the SST 
project, but a number of other observatories

12:59.943 --> 13:18.367
where I knew that there were high-resolution 
spectroscopists and people involved in the

12:59.943 --> 13:18.367
construction of high-resolution spectros. Let 
me ask you a historical question. If you held this

13:22.473 --> 13:29.562
conference entirely by email, were there any 
records kept of what went back Everything was

13:30.419 --> 13:35.204
automatically recorded in real time. I have all 
those records, both in my computer records and in

13:35.805 --> 13:41.891
hard copy. I have not otherwise published the 
records. I have simply made it known that those

13:45.655 --> 13:58.468
records are in my computer files and accessible to 
people locally and have let people know by word of

13:59.900 --> 14:01.703
mouth that they are available. Now, you're in an 
interesting position because you've done some

14:03.025 --> 14:14.181
work in planetary astronomy, but you're not 
really a planetary astronomer, so you have kind of

14:03.025 --> 14:14.181
an inside-outside view. Yeah, that's right. Do 
you think planetary astronomers are looked down

14:16.064 --> 14:22.414
upon by real astronomers? Oh, to some extent, I 
know that's true. Yes. Well, of course, it's

14:27.322 --> 14:40.017
really hard to talk about how the 107-inch was 
viewed here in Texas, because it was a small

14:27.322 --> 14:40.017
department, so you really couldn't have big 
factions.

14:41.138 --> 14:50.950
But when the idea of taking money from NASA to build 
a telescope that would spend a large amount of time

14:41.138 --> 14:50.950
working on other planets Was that well received 
here by the staff and also by the administration of

14:52.077 --> 14:58.585
the university as far as you know? Well, as far as I 
know, yes. As you implied, the staff, the faculty

15:02.330 --> 15:09.699
was quite small at the time that we began the 
project. There were some members of the faculty

15:09.719 --> 15:16.768
who did not participate actively and so far as I'm 
aware, have never actually used the telescope

15:18.098 --> 15:24.245
since it was built. And as far as I'm, that has been 
the only

15:24.265 --> 15:40.905
hint I have, I think, that there is anyone who felt 
that it was not a proper project to carry out. I'm

15:42.346 --> 15:44.629
skipping around a bit here, but Do you get requests 
from people to design things, or do you get an idea

15:46.955 --> 16:07.982
and say, hey, why don't we build this or design this 
or something, or is it a combination of both?

16:08.002 --> 16:10.125
Not very many such requests from outside. Of 
course, Harlan Smith is a great source of ideas.

16:17.735 --> 16:22.620
would often ask, well, wouldn't it be a good idea to 
do this? And I think more than most cases, more than

16:24.102 --> 16:30.689
half the cases, I would say no. But there were 
certainly those cases where I said yes. And Harlan

16:36.836 --> 16:47.067
Smith was always my strongest supporter in 
instrumentation. deeply my interests in the

16:47.468 --> 16:58.180
reticon development and in the intensified 
reticon, which we called the self-scanned

16:47.468 --> 16:58.180
digicon. He made the original suggestion 
concerning the construction of the octicon,

16:58.200 --> 17:16.260
which was, it doesn't exist anymore, but at the 
time that we built it, it was an array of eight

16:58.200 --> 17:16.260
linear reticon arrays butted end to end along the 
photographic plate holder, effectively, of the

17:17.152 --> 17:32.319
40 inch diameter, 1.8

17:17.152 --> 17:32.319
meter focal length camera of the Kudai 
spectrograph. That was completed in 1984. We

17:35.946 --> 17:37.008
retired it. Let me clarify a point. It was built, 
and the NSF supported it, for the specific purpose

17:41.384 --> 17:54.612
to be an interim instrument until large format 
CCDs should become readily available. And it

17:54.632 --> 18:02.228
served that purpose at the time that the Tektronix 
CCD 2048 by 2048 CCD came close to being available,

18:03.018 --> 18:14.473
we retired it as we built the instrument that has 
now replaced it, which we call 2D Kudeng.

18:16.917 --> 18:23.205
You mentioned that Harlan was always a strong 
supporter of yours, and obviously he's one guy I

18:16.917 --> 18:23.205
can't interview.

18:26.750 --> 18:27.591
Tell me about Harlan.

18:30.693 --> 18:43.828
Well, Harlan came here with strong support from 
the University of Chicago staff, in particular in

18:30.693 --> 18:43.828
63, which was the couple of years after I came. He 
came here already with ideas of expanding this

18:44.549 --> 18:59.265
department and building a much larger telescope, 
or at least a telescope equal to the 82-inch

18:44.549 --> 18:59.265
telescope. He, it was his vision that eventually 
we would have a staff of something like 20

19:01.220 --> 19:15.640
faculty members and a group of something like 50 
graduate students. At the time this sounded like

19:15.800 --> 19:19.486
an idle dream, but in fact it was not. That is where 
we are now. And it was indeed Harlan's drive that

19:21.969 --> 19:28.999
brought this about.

19:30.329 --> 19:43.660
He did bring in the NASA funding for the 107-inch 
telescope in the mid-'60s, and we constructed

19:30.329 --> 19:43.660
that telescope and completed it in early 1969.

19:46.623 --> 19:50.146
Basically, that was Harlan's telescope. Didn't 
that come in over budget?

19:55.411 --> 19:59.374
I left headquarters by then to go back. I don't know 
any project that doesn't come in over budget to

20:00.063 --> 20:05.969
some extent. To

20:06.170 --> 20:23.128
go back to your instrumentation life again, once 
you design something like a reticon or something

20:06.170 --> 20:23.128
and it's done and built, is there usually much 
interaction with the people that use it? You know,

20:23.148 --> 20:29.935
coming back and saying, look Bob, you can turn it 90 
degrees or something like this, or does it just go

20:23.148 --> 20:29.935
off into a black hole? My instrument would be a 
total failure if it weren't for that type of

20:30.472 --> 20:38.124
interaction. If an instrument, for example, is 
not used to begin with by the observing

20:38.144 --> 20:48.120
astronomers, then it might not as well have ever 
been built. In my case, I've had very excellent

20:49.282 --> 20:55.872
relationships with observing astronomers. We 
have worked together in developing the

20:56.442 --> 20:59.126
instruments. We have worked together in 
developing the methods of using them. And I think

21:04.755 --> 21:12.267
we kind of continue to see future development 
together.

21:16.234 --> 21:19.118
Now to go back to Harlan again. Do you think he might 
have done even more had he done a little less? Would

21:25.703 --> 21:27.806
you mind rephrasing the question? If he would have 
stopped and taken a breath once in a while.

21:34.256 --> 21:49.559
There were times

21:34.256 --> 21:49.559
increasingly toward the end of his career when he 
met resistance to all that drive that he had. The

21:49.579 --> 21:54.647
administration of the university was becoming 
increasingly strapped for state funds over the

21:55.032 --> 22:01.320
past dozen years or so. And Harlan Smith

22:02.762 --> 22:11.653
refused to allow that to slow him down.

22:15.898 --> 22:17.260
Requests that he made to the administration back 
in the early days, such as when the 170th was being

22:17.543 --> 22:37.051
built, were met, I think, much more eagerly than 
they were in later days when there simply wasn't

22:17.543 --> 22:37.051
that much of a margin between requests and the 
wherewithal to support them.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.605
I'm not sure that he could have done any more than he 
did whether he slowed down or speeded up in his

22:47.513 --> 22:50.396
drive. As you're well aware, one of his dreams was 
astronomy from the surface of the moon. And I don't

23:02.910 --> 23:15.765
know where that idea is going to go, and I don't know 
whether there would have been a better or worse

23:02.910 --> 23:15.765
chance for that ever to happen had he not passed 
away. Well,

23:17.669 --> 23:24.098
let's start with your case. But anyway, most 
astronomy departments are replete with

23:24.118 --> 23:30.267
backstabbing. Did Harlan, I mean, and this place 
is actually fairly well known, justly or

23:32.110 --> 23:42.685
unjustly, for not really being that bad in that 
respect. Did Harlan help with that or hinder or

23:42.745 --> 23:46.090
didn't make any difference? because there were 
all these guys here. One of Harlan's outstanding

23:50.698 --> 24:00.729
qualities was support of his people.

24:00.749 --> 24:12.803
I have never heard him degrade any of the research 
or faculty people here.

24:14.335 --> 24:24.351
He has supported people who, it's probably the 
opinion of most people around here, didn't

24:14.335 --> 24:24.351
deserve support. Are we talking a group of all in 
this, too? Well, yes, that's one.

24:33.927 --> 24:40.478
I'm thinking specifically of the young man, Jack 
Hyde, who shot the bullet holes in the 170-inch

24:41.251 --> 24:52.084
primary mirror back in, what was it, 69 or 70.

24:52.104 --> 24:58.191
Harlan gave him a great deal of support 
afterwards. That, I think, amazed everybody.

25:03.637 --> 25:11.106
I understand that the man's wife also supported 
him greatly, and that eventually he was worked

25:11.575 --> 25:23.047
himself into a much more comfortable position in 
life, but at the time things looked

25:11.575 --> 25:23.047
grim. What piece of work, if you've turned out, do 
you think was your best? You know, we're going to

25:30.335 --> 25:34.680
chisel something out of your tombstone. Oh, I 
suppose it would be the Kudai spectrograph and the

25:34.700 --> 25:41.447
107-inch telescope. I have to qualify that to some 
extent in that that particular project, as true of

25:44.009 --> 25:58.186
a number of projects, wasn't the type of thing you 
do and then it's finished. I designed the

25:59.989 --> 26:10.101
spectrograph, we got it built as part of the 
107-inch construction project,

26:10.368 --> 26:13.351
Well, my design of it was the optical design. The 
mechanical design was done by with a lot of

26:13.411 --> 26:21.481
preliminary work here by our engineers. So there 
were a lot of people involved in it. But it got

26:27.127 --> 26:31.212
installed, and we started using it 
photographically. And then we immediately built

26:31.312 --> 26:39.261
a scanner for it that very same year, which was in 
operation within three months of the completion

26:40.152 --> 26:44.135
of the telescope. It has been that way ever since. 
It still is a project. It is a continuing project.

26:54.925 --> 27:02.071
And I've been involved with it, and nobody has told 
me to stop. So I simply continue to allow it to grow

27:02.091 --> 27:08.877
and evolve. try to keep up with the times. There 
have been one difficulty with

27:11.232 --> 27:38.475
technology probably in general is that if you stop 
at a given time and adopt what's available at that

27:11.232 --> 27:38.475
time, it's very difficult to evolve away from that 
particular development in view of further, even

27:11.232 --> 27:38.475
better developments after that and one tends to 
find oneself with obsolete equipment within a few

27:39.029 --> 27:44.037
years. I've attempted to alleviate that as much as 
possible by trying to go on to the next step. And one

27:55.115 --> 28:04.530
of those examples is the fact that we did build 
Opticon at a time when there wasn't a clear

28:04.932 --> 28:17.949
direction toward getting very large array CCDs, 
and we gladly retired it when it was time to replace

28:04.932 --> 28:17.949
it with the next step up. Are the detectors pretty 
much all CCDs now? Yes, they're virtually all CCDs

28:21.634 --> 28:25.239
now. The scanner, in fact, is still in place. and is 
occasionally used for scanning, say,

28:29.502 --> 28:45.250
transmission profiles of interference filters, 
which makes it probably the best spectrograph in

28:29.502 --> 28:45.250
the world for that particular application. It 
sure is.

28:48.977 --> 28:52.523
So you have in the past taken N-ASA money.

28:54.764 --> 28:57.647
Did you have any problems with them? Or did they 
come through pretty well? Or did they try and tell

29:00.229 --> 29:02.692
you what to do too much? Well,

29:04.233 --> 29:15.885
I don't believe that I've ever directly requested 
a grant from NASA. I have worked within the overall

29:17.306 --> 29:24.433
planetary grant of the McDonald Observatory. and 
have made my requests through that grant.

29:33.441 --> 29:45.379
I have been quite pleased with the

29:33.441 --> 29:45.379
support of NASA for my instrumentation project 
here. Have you had any NSF support? Yes. And how

29:48.023 --> 29:49.105
does that compare?

29:54.687 --> 30:04.538
My

29:54.687 --> 30:04.538
NSFs are, well, I've...

30:04.558 --> 30:11.585
I mean, are they freer with their money or let you do 
more what you want? There are times when I feel that

30:11.605 --> 30:15.710
NSF is freer with the money. There are times when I 
feel that that NASA, for whatever reason, perhaps

30:19.139 --> 30:44.320
it's individuals who happened to be in the office 
at that time,

30:19.139 --> 30:44.320
are rather more pessimistic about what I can do, or 
what anybody can do, particularly in

30:19.139 --> 30:44.320
ground-based astronomy, than the view that I get 
from NSF.

30:48.103 --> 30:48.724
What do... What do people, what is the reaction, 
the reactions of people that you meet when you tell

30:50.122 --> 30:59.353
them what you do for a living? Do they think it's 
neat? Do they think you're a parasite or what? I

31:06.621 --> 31:13.049
haven't heard much reference to parasitism at 
all. You're speaking, I presume, of people

31:14.330 --> 31:17.354
outside of strength. Yeah, right. I've always had 
the greatest respect from people with whom I've

31:18.421 --> 31:24.108
discussed these things. Mike Belton got called 
that by a plumber, so I know it exists. This again is

31:30.656 --> 31:35.482
personal opinion, but I'm building up personal 
opinions, a file of them. Do you think astronomy

31:35.982 --> 31:41.409
has sold itself well, has done a good job of selling 
itself to the public? I think it has, apparently

31:41.429 --> 31:43.872
so.

31:47.834 --> 32:06.730
I suppose I could sound a little bit brash to say 
that I think we've done it very well here in Texas

31:47.834 --> 32:06.730
through our Stardate program, for example, our 
overall public outreach program, which I think is

31:47.834 --> 32:06.730
an exceptionally good one. It has been very 
effective. I can't give you numbers now, but every

32:08.191 --> 32:17.419
year we have more and more visitors at McDonald 
Observatory.

32:18.226 --> 32:33.791
It's my understanding that some observatories

32:18.226 --> 32:33.791
restrict visitors quite a bit, and that had never 
been

32:18.226 --> 32:33.791
the philosophy of McDonald Observatory. We have a 
visitor's center with a well-equipped staff.

32:39.742 --> 32:53.883
associated directly with the visitors program 
which is also running the Stardate radio program

32:39.742 --> 32:53.883
and the Stardate magazine.

32:57.449 --> 33:02.576
The public response to this has been extremely 
good.

33:06.082 --> 33:09.006
I had occasion to visit the observatory over the 
Easter weekend with my grandson's Boy Scout

33:09.205 --> 33:16.256
troop. And we attended the public night at the 
observatory and the place was essentially packed

33:17.898 --> 33:25.910
with the public. They are all there, eager and 
anxious to stand out there in the cold under the

33:25.930 --> 33:34.183
stars and have somebody point out 
constellations.
