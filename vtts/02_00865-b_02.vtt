WEBVTT

00:06.680 --> 00:10.544
Okay, you said that you were working the steam 
pumps over at the Big Lump? Big Lump, yeah. And that

00:11.565 --> 00:16.930
was... And at the recluta, I come and work for the 
witch mine, they used to call it. Well, I worked

00:18.051 --> 00:19.352
there a little while. Mr. Sam Yokel was the boss, 
and he told me, Thomas, I heard that you could work

00:19.472 --> 00:25.838
on the steam pumps, pumps and water coolers. And I 
said, yeah. So he gave me the job in the recluta.

00:29.461 --> 00:30.843
Working the steam pumps. So you weren't working 
underground? Yeah. The steam pumps were down in

00:33.882 --> 00:35.684
the ground, too. The steam pumps were down in the 
ground? Yeah. And I worked on the harvesting

00:38.166 --> 00:45.033
engine, harvesting the coal out of the coal mine. I 
see. Like Agostino Garcia. I see. And how did you

00:47.095 --> 00:49.197
get paid? Well, I don't remember. I think it was a 
general price, about $2. Okay. Yeah. And how many

00:56.804 --> 00:58.766
hours a day did you work? Worked from 6 until I got to 
get up in the morning, fire up the boiler. raise the

01:02.620 --> 01:07.665
steam to let the hand of the workmen go down to the 
coal. Worked about nine hours sometimes, 10

01:09.006 --> 01:12.489
hours. Did you prefer running the steam engine to 
coal mining? Yeah. You made more money that way,

01:17.414 --> 01:18.975
didn't you? Yeah, and it was not hard as work, 
because it was hard on my eyes. When I fired the

01:24.000 --> 01:27.583
boiler, see, that was hot. You think that's why 
your eyes are kind of bad? I think so. But they told

01:30.903 --> 01:41.916
me in town, they told me that it was mines with about 
200,000 diabetes.

01:42.477 --> 01:49.426
At all the mines, let's see, you worked at the Bogle 
mine, the Texas Coal Company mine, the Big Lump

01:42.477 --> 01:49.426
mine, the Witcher mine. Yeah. I worked at the 
Worley mine. At the Worley mine. And with all that

01:54.912 --> 01:57.575
experience, did you ever see any accidents? No.

02:03.303 --> 02:10.150
At all those mines, did they take the mules down in 
the morning and bring them up? They'd come down in

02:10.210 --> 02:15.775
the morning, bring them out, feed them, give them 
some hay and corn. Now, local folk company, they

02:16.256 --> 02:21.321
used to give them some corn down in the corn. They'd 
tear some corn down in the hay and would feed them

02:21.521 --> 02:26.065
good. Down inside the mine? Inside the mine. Would 
they take them out of the mine every night? They'd

02:30.369 --> 02:32.972
take them out every evening. What kind of mules 
were they? Were they big mules? Well, ordinary

02:36.421 --> 02:38.343
mules. Ordinary mules, okay. Some big and some 
little. Have you ever owned any land yourself?

02:44.989 --> 02:45.410
Yeah. When did you own it and how did you get it? 
Well, I tell you, I bought it in the camp. I bought 30

02:51.075 --> 02:56.440
acres of land with a two-story building. Where did 
you save the money to buy the land? I bought it in the

03:01.145 --> 03:02.166
bank. It was on credit. On credit? Paid so much to 
pay. I see. And you used the money from working at

03:08.054 --> 03:12.479
the mine to pay off? No, there was no coal mine then. 
Yeah, but I landed in 1943, I think it was.

03:20.789 --> 03:21.009
I see. And after my wife died, I sold the land and 
moved the house right here in town. So after that, I

03:29.888 --> 03:39.583
sold a house, and that's me without

03:29.888 --> 03:39.583
a house. Did you ever attend, did you attend church 
every week?

03:46.314 --> 03:51.462
Did most of the people attend church out there? 
Well, I did for my, I mean, right there, yeah. Every

03:52.924 --> 03:53.665
Sunday. They'd walk in? Yeah. Yeah, people live 
right here. Some of them got a car, well, they go to

03:57.389 --> 04:00.572
church on that car. Did the Mexican people have 
their own church? No. They went to... Most of the

04:07.938 --> 04:10.721
people, the Spanish people, they're Catholics. 
And they got a Catholic

04:11.481 --> 04:16.546
church here. I see. Were you glad when the mines 
shut down? Well, I was not too glad. You see, that's

04:25.846 --> 04:33.197
the only kind of work that I had done in my life, work 
at the coal mines. What did you do when the mines

04:33.217 --> 04:35.140
shut down? Well, just like I told you a while ago, I 
went to pick cotton. When it was ready to be picked,

04:39.387 --> 04:44.554
I picked cotton, and then I'd go out and cut wood, 
grub. What did the other Spanish people do? What

04:47.639 --> 04:50.043
did the other Spanish people do when the mines shut 
down? Well, they did the same thing. Some of them

04:53.468 --> 04:54.790
went to farms. There don't seem to be that many 
Spanish people left around Rockdale. No. What

05:00.216 --> 05:02.199
happened to the United States? Well, they all 
moved away. You know where they moved and why?

05:06.326 --> 05:09.211
Yeah, some of them moved from Malakoff. Some of 
them moved from Rockdale to Malakoff. And from

05:12.837 --> 05:16.002
Malakoff, some of the coal mines played out. And 
some of them went to Lorain, Ohio. Some of them in

05:22.092 --> 05:23.494
Indiana. Several places. Some of them, they 
transport them back to Mexico. Those that don't

05:28.819 --> 05:33.824
want to go to Mexico, the company would transport 
the people. The company would transfer them back?

05:35.586 --> 05:36.186
Yeah. I see. Transported up to, like, Malakoff, 
you know, people working there. There was no more

05:42.252 --> 05:43.453
coal mines. There was a lot of Spanish people 
there. They sent them back, some of them, to

05:46.175 --> 05:48.077
Mexico. Some of them, they went out of the state of 
Texas to work. Uh, do you remember any times when

05:54.693 --> 06:00.981
new miners would come up from Mexico? No. I mean, 
uh, how did, uh, how did the Spanish people get here

06:03.324 --> 06:09.812
to work the mines? Well, some of them there was, uh, 
farmers, and they went to work in that coal mine,

06:10.193 --> 06:16.781
because they could make a little more money every 
day. I see. I was under the impression that the, uh,

06:20.343 --> 06:23.247
coal companies went down to Mexico and brought 
Spanish people up here? No, some people, you know,

06:23.267 --> 06:29.696
some of the Spanish people, they had a family here 
and had some of them in Mexico. Well, they go to the

06:30.237 --> 06:40.131
head man of the coal mine and ask him to let them have 
some money so they could bring in the people from

06:30.237 --> 06:40.131
Mexico. And that's the way it is. But there was a lot 
of Mexican people here that they come from Mexico.

06:48.263 --> 06:49.084
Some of them from the other coal mines in the United 
States. When did your dad come here from Mexico? He

07:00.610 --> 07:02.071
was from Mexico, yeah. What part of Mexico? From 
Guanajuato. Guanajuato. Guanajuato. Do you

07:11.562 --> 07:16.607
remember when he came to Texas?

07:17.380 --> 07:19.062
1889, I think. I see. You were born 1890.

07:27.271 --> 07:30.355
Can you think of any humorous stories that 
happened at the mine? Anything that makes you

07:30.395 --> 07:32.137
laugh? You were telling me about that Model T that 
fell in the shaft one day. Oh yeah, that was a fella,

07:36.622 --> 07:41.447
you know, they was cutting wood for Mr. Noye. And 
they got up one Monday morning, I think they must

07:43.317 --> 07:50.765
have been drinking or something. And they stayed 
up, I think, Saturday night, all night, or Sunday

07:50.785 --> 07:57.252
night. And they got up and set up a bottle of tea. You 
know, they went down in that gully, you know,

08:01.336 --> 08:05.360
within that branch of it. They went down and come 
up, and they lost the road somehow. Was it their

08:11.146 --> 08:12.748
bottle of tea? Yeah.

08:17.911 --> 08:20.854
Well, can you think of anything else you'd like to? 
That's all I can think of. Did the Spanish people

08:24.897 --> 08:27.239
seem to be happy here at Tomas? Oh, yeah. Was there 
ever any trouble of any sort? Oh, well, sometimes a

08:33.925 --> 08:36.948
little fight. Fish fight, I don't know.

08:44.615 --> 08:46.977
Okay, well, I sure do thank you, Tomas. I 
appreciate your patience more than anything

08:48.185 --> 08:50.230
else. Well, that's okay. Like I told you a while 
ago, there's nothing I can do to help you go around

08:52.074 --> 09:00.372
there and show them old coal holes.
