WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:10.124
We were talking about football and that game in 
Austin and so forth. What athletic events do you

00:10.324 --> 00:16.614
remember most in those first three years? Well, of 
course, that game was quite important. The game we

00:20.700 --> 00:27.591
beat the University of Texas here in 1939 was when 
we cinched the championship. because we were

00:28.432 --> 00:29.873
tied. We were zero, I think, in the first play. In 
the second, we had a hideout play, and Herb Smith

00:32.436 --> 00:39.582
caught a pass for a touchdown. We beat them 21 to 
nothing. As far as you know, did athletes go to

00:41.724 --> 00:47.850
class and graduate then pretty well? I really 
can't say particularly what they did. Of course,

00:52.814 --> 00:56.818
most of them at that time, they better have gone 
through and and get their commissions and go on. I

00:59.515 --> 01:02.018
think that's what most of them did. Were there any 
of those football players that you all respected

01:03.279 --> 01:09.406
highly? Of course, Kimbrough was outstanding, of 
course, I guess. He was a fine fellow. He even

01:17.434 --> 01:20.597
caught a ride with him one time in this thing. He had 
his own car and whatnot. What was your impression

01:24.521 --> 01:26.063
of him? Well, I think he was a fine fellow, really 
was. In fact, I think that whole team was pretty

01:28.680 --> 01:32.345
good. I had Buster Keaton, who was a junior yell 
leader then, and was quite close to him, much more

01:32.365 --> 01:41.498
so than now. He said, oh, Marshall Robnett, who was 
a guard, he said that what old Robnett would do,

01:42.058 --> 01:55.797
first play from scrimmage, he'd urinate all over 
himself.

01:58.426 --> 02:02.915
He was really rough and this sort of thing. That's 
about all of them. I really can't say more than

02:07.004 --> 02:09.209
that. What about the core leadership in terms of 
the commandant and the advisors? Who were they

02:18.148 --> 02:19.270
then? Well, of course, Colonel Welty was our 
advisor for the Signal Corps. Colonel Davis, he

02:27.952 --> 02:33.543
was an Aggie, and he was kind of permanent. He 
wasn't a PMS&T. PMS&T, of course, was on active

02:35.626 --> 02:40.776
duty, and they sent him here for several years. 
And, of course, one of them, That was the PMS&T

02:43.685 --> 02:48.212
wound up in Corregidor. I really can't say more 
than that. Our own Lieutenant Lerner, I imagine he

02:54.281 --> 03:00.850
was a signal coordinator sort of for it. We got 
acquainted with the enlisted men, too. We took

03:03.194 --> 03:04.235
code. So we had an enlisted man that teaches Mars 
code in the Bolton Hall. And then Sergeant Snyder

03:13.840 --> 03:19.686
was also with the Signal Corps, and when the war 
came on, they gave him a commission. But that's

03:19.726 --> 03:23.790
about all I can say about them. Did you know Colonel 
Andy? Well, no, Colonel Andy was the track coach.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.421
So he was not the commandant then? No.

03:37.565 --> 03:42.430
Let's see, we mentioned Muster.

03:42.899 --> 03:44.141
Final review. Was there final review held in those 
days? Oh, sure. Where? On where they have final

03:49.609 --> 03:55.297
reviews now, in front of the Memorial Student 
Center. At that time, those were campus houses

03:55.818 --> 03:58.682
along there. But for final review, just like it is 
now, you marched around once with the seniors, and

03:59.343 --> 04:07.495
then you marched again without the seniors. The 
new seniors took over. They didn't go home and put

04:10.355 --> 04:13.638
their boots on, though, or anything like that. And 
it just went right through. I remember one time my

04:16.600 --> 04:20.864
freshman year standing so straight. I don't know 
if it was the final review of Mother's Day or

04:22.345 --> 04:25.148
something. Anyway, I fainted. Because when you 
stand straight and you don't wiggle your toes, the

04:26.849 --> 04:32.995
next thing I knew I was on the ground.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.400
As the war progressed, as Life gets more serious. 
Did the freshman hazing here change? Well, I think

04:46.496 --> 04:48.178
it let up quite a bit. I feel sure it must have 
because we realized the seriousness of it. As I

04:51.861 --> 04:56.626
say, when I was a company commander, I had them cut 
it out. And you lived all of those pre-war years in

04:56.666 --> 05:05.775
what is now the Corps? I lived in Dorm 1, but what 
happened? In the summer of 40, no, let's see, the

05:08.995 --> 05:22.365
fall of 42, they brought in a lot of Navy men for code 
practice and for repair. So all 12 dormitories

05:22.946 --> 05:28.759
were taken over by them, and we doubled up. in 
Mitchell Hall, and all those, of course, we got

05:29.043 --> 05:32.486
much smaller by then. We put three in a room. You'd 
have

05:33.807 --> 05:38.331
a bunk three high. So we lived in Mitchell Hall that 
fall. Do you remember any changes in any

05:41.894 --> 05:49.580
curriculum, any courses that seemed to be 
war-related? No, not really. I kind of think we

05:51.522 --> 05:57.947
eliminated final exams, I'm not sure, because of 
the speed-up. Mm-hmm. And so at night, did you and

05:59.924 --> 06:05.713
your buddies listen to the war news regularly? No, 
I don't remember doing that. No, I really don't.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.142
And you didn't take a daily paper. Nobody took a 
newspaper. I think we did kind of, yeah. We kept up

06:16.629 --> 06:20.695
with it, but I don't know that we dwelt on it a lot. 
And as the war is going on, how often did you go home

06:20.715 --> 06:26.404
to Dallas? Well, of course we had gas rationing. So 
we went, I'd say, two or three times a semester. And

06:35.526 --> 06:38.115
as I say, I went home that fall and got the car so I 
could bring my date back and other people and that

06:38.467 --> 06:44.295
sort of thing. And also you had to drive at 35 or 40 
miles an hour. Now, did you keep the car down here

06:48.041 --> 06:49.903
then? No, I didn't. I kept it down just for that 
couple of weeks. No, no. And your microphone fell

06:55.531 --> 06:58.255
down. Yeah. And of course you got gas rationing 
stamps and this sort of thing. Let's see. I don't

07:08.935 --> 07:09.997
know what I'm going to do. I'm going to put that 
microphone right there and see if I can keep it.

07:16.689 --> 07:17.089
Yeah. All right. You go away to the war and then come 
back when? I came back the fall of 46. 46, not 45, 46.

07:29.705 --> 07:33.949
No, this is what happened after the war was over. 
You had a points system, and you had to get so many

07:33.989 --> 07:39.654
points you were entitled to get out. Well, I didn't 
go overseas, so I didn't get as many points as one

07:40.495 --> 07:54.188
that did go overseas, so many of them are already 
coming back for the summer semester and even for

07:40.495 --> 07:54.188
the spring semester of 46. I had 40 hours to go. It 
took three semesters, though, because of the

07:56.677 --> 08:01.725
sequence of courses that I needed to take. What was 
different about your attitude from being a

08:02.527 --> 08:09.297
student in 46 than it ever was? I wanted to get 
through school and get out and go to work. What had

08:13.063 --> 08:21.677
you learned during the war that helped you in your 
courses? Oh, I just got a maturity. I did get to be a

08:25.352 --> 08:28.657
cryptographic officer. I did study teletype,

08:29.318 --> 08:38.531
go through maintenance school, and then also 
through the cryptographic machines. So I had more

08:39.111 --> 08:43.357
of an idea of applications and this sort of thing. 
But I mainly wanted to get through and get out and

08:44.659 --> 08:47.543
get a job. Now, you said you were married and had a 
youngster. I met my wife at the University of

08:50.347 --> 08:52.710
Delaware. And I took her to her junior prom, but 
that first date I said, I just met the girl I'm going

08:53.213 --> 08:59.261
to marry. So after I got out of OCS and she 
graduated, we got married. And we had one child in

09:03.786 --> 09:10.234
the service, and the second one was born here while 
I was back in school. And you all lived in, when you

09:10.715 --> 09:13.859
came here, you lived where? The what? When you came 
here with your wife and child, where did you all

09:15.100 --> 09:19.205
live? Oh, we... She lived with my parents in Dallas 
until College View Apartments opened, so I lived

09:19.960 --> 09:26.688
in the dormitory. Describe life in College View. 
In College View? Well, my wife is about the only one

09:31.414 --> 09:36.200
that couldn't drive a car. She was a Yankee. But all 
these Texas girls, they knew how to drive and

09:37.762 --> 09:41.026
everything. And, of course, we were all veterans, 
and they had different stories about pregnancy

09:41.447 --> 09:47.875
and this sort of thing. And we played baseball. We 
had baseball teams. And I had a bicycle. I didn't

09:54.872 --> 09:56.093
have a car. And A&P in Bryan was the closest place 
for a supermarket. So I'd ride that bicycle all the

10:01.619 --> 10:07.325
way into Bryan to pick up our groceries and this 
sort of thing. And it was just one big happy family.

10:11.469 --> 10:13.491
All of us more or less had children. And they had a 
great time together. I think it was a real way for

10:15.960 --> 10:21.167
our oldest daughter to mature, to get with these 
older boys. Were you a better student? Oh,

10:24.692 --> 10:25.373
definitely. Oh, sure, definitely. Did your 
grades show it? Yeah, pretty well. At that time,

10:31.061 --> 10:35.988
you could exempt final exams if you had good enough 
grades. I was taking an M.E. course, and I was going

10:39.713 --> 10:41.976
to exempt, and So the prof came in and said, well, 
everybody's going to have to take the final.

10:46.927 --> 10:48.910
Somebody stole my grade book. Well, I was going to 
get out. But then after a while, he came back and

10:52.997 --> 10:56.884
says, well, my grade book came back. So I got out. 
And there was a football player who stole that

10:59.389 --> 11:03.235
grade book. So he got it back. Ed Holdridge told me 
that story. Now, you were here how long after the

11:08.197 --> 11:11.222
war? Well, I was here a full year. A full year. And 
what did you think you were preparing yourself

11:15.008 --> 11:19.095
for? What kind of career did you? Well, of course, 
being an elected engineer, I could have gone with,

11:21.018 --> 11:31.335
say, GE or Westinghouse or Alachammer's or a 
utility or with a telephone company. Well, my

11:31.906 --> 11:41.830
father worked for Graybar Electric Company in 
Dallas, and so the branch manager in Houston

11:31.906 --> 11:41.830
convinced me to go with them, which I did, worked 
for them for nine years. And one of the

11:42.491 --> 11:46.962
propositions was GE would take me and send me 
through the test course where I would learn GE

11:47.347 --> 11:52.936
equipment so that when I went with Graybar, I would 
be able to sell the stuff better. So anyway, we

11:53.577 --> 11:56.201
moved to Houston after graduation. And so at that 
point, you weren't thinking about an academic

11:56.541 --> 12:00.207
career? Nobody else was thinking of one for me 
either. When I finally got one and I told my

12:03.232 --> 12:10.283
daughter that I was going to teach at A&M, she says, 
Daddy, you're not smart enough to teach. But after

12:12.187 --> 12:18.302
I was in Houston for six years and got transferred 
to Baton Rouge and then transferred back over. And

12:18.683 --> 12:22.994
I was living here, traveling the territory when I 
got a chance to teach. My next door neighbor was

12:23.014 --> 12:27.124
Frank Vandiver in Baton Rouge for one summer. 
Yeah, he was there taught for the summer. He was

12:29.515 --> 12:36.563
down at Tulane at the time, and then he came over to 
Rice, and that's when he was your prof, wasn't he?

12:36.583 --> 12:38.666
I'm his first doctoral student. At Rice, yeah. 
And, of course, we knew Susie, his first wife. We

12:43.672 --> 12:46.355
went by and visited them and all that. Marvelous 
person. Did you go to Mustard that senior year when

12:50.740 --> 12:57.027
you came back? No, definitely. Did it seem 
different to you after the war? Okay. It was in

13:05.234 --> 13:08.879
front of what was the administration building. It 
was there that day, and that's where we had our

13:09.400 --> 13:12.865
muster. It was an afternoon meeting. Did things on 
the campus seem more serious in 46, 47? Oh, I think

13:18.593 --> 13:21.758
so. We were all predominantly veterans. And we 
wanted to get in and get out. And I'm assuming that

13:29.484 --> 13:33.709
hazing wasn't very prevalent then. No. What did 
all of these young wives do? Well, they were mostly

13:39.815 --> 13:41.297
pregnant. They didn't work, though, at all. I 
mean, we got, I guess, $90 a month plus all of our

13:45.461 --> 13:52.008
tuition, and that was about it. Did the GI Bill 
pretty well pay your way? Well, yep, I think pretty

13:55.090 --> 13:57.713
well. They also paid all the tuition costs and all 
the books and this sort of thing. But then it wasn't

14:02.698 --> 14:04.640
$90 a month. Where did you and your wife get your 
furnishings for that College View? Oh, it was

14:09.324 --> 14:10.205
furnished. Oh, it was. It had just the normal cots, 
and it had, I think, a double bed in the bedroom and

14:11.687 --> 14:24.760
bunk beds. How did y'all get here? How did you 
arrive in College Station? How did we arrive?

14:31.379 --> 14:37.670
Well, we just went up to Dallas on the train and 
drove her back with what belongings we had. We had,

14:37.710 --> 14:46.967
I guess, a baby bed we put her in and a little washing 
machine and a few other things, and that was it.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.483
Let's see, and you're not in the Corps as a veteran. 
And were there some faculty members that were

14:53.325 --> 15:04.355
really important to you as you look back now that 
you had in that post-war year?

15:07.618 --> 15:10.982
I really can't say there were any at all. If you 
could, throughout all of your years at A&M, If you

15:18.605 --> 15:30.555
could recall them

15:18.605 --> 15:30.555
to life and thank them personally, to which 
faculty members do you feel the most grateful?

15:31.216 --> 15:33.818
Well, of course, the electrical engineering 
class, Foyker. Which ones? Well, Foyker I thought

15:34.899 --> 15:42.445
was nice, and Dillingham, Norman Road, and R.P. 
Ward.

15:46.369 --> 15:47.970
I thought the liberal arts, teachers were all very 
good, the English and of course the math profs and

15:48.288 --> 15:56.819
this sort of thing. I had Luther way back when I was a 
freshman in trigonometry. And of course one

16:01.825 --> 16:11.578
fellow I'm fond of is Alphabet Thompson, J. George 
H. Thompson. And we had him in kinematics drawing.

16:15.003 --> 16:16.485
This is before the war. And so he was talking about 
he went to Penn State and what it cost him on the

16:16.565 --> 16:22.011
weekend to have a date. And my roommate said, well, 
I went up to TSCW and back for the weekend and I spent

16:22.772 --> 16:29.040
25 cents. Well, he couldn't imagine that because 
he hitchhiked and they fed him up there and that

16:29.681 --> 16:35.828
sort of thing. I know I've heard many people refer 
to Dr. Thompson with gratitude. Oh, yeah. What

16:42.694 --> 16:44.136
were his trademarks? What did he do that was 
special? Oh, I don't know. He was just genuinely

16:47.201 --> 16:49.465
interested in me. I know when I was teaching, I had a 
guy taking a course from me, and he questioned how I

16:49.485 --> 17:03.486
had graded his papers. And I didn't know if he could 
show me where he got it from, okay. And so he didn't

17:10.133 --> 17:11.915
say any more. And a little while he came back, and he 
confessed that he had cheated. And the way, what he

17:18.466 --> 17:26.059
happened, so he, George noticed that he was just 
kind of upset or something, didn't know what to do.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.282
He finally asked him, what's wrong? And he told 
him. And George says, well, you can do two things,

17:30.550 --> 17:36.638
not do anything, or you can go back and tell me. But 
you must remember, he can kick you out of school

17:37.560 --> 17:41.906
because of that. So anyway, he came back and 
confessed and told me the story and this sort of

17:42.547 --> 17:46.933
thing. But of course, I wasn't going to do anything 
about it. Did you give him any advice then? Who,

17:53.041 --> 17:54.123
that young man? Yes. No, not really. I can't 
remember giving him any advice. What else can you

17:58.116 --> 18:01.360
say? Let me put in the notes here then, one that I had 
like that. This was about March. I was in my office

18:08.688 --> 18:16.137
talking to my grader, and a sophomore came, and he 
said, I need to talk to you. I said, well, come back

18:16.337 --> 18:19.781
in a few minutes because I'm busy right now. He came 
back about a half hour later. And he closed the door

18:22.036 --> 18:26.181
behind me, which is a little bit of a surprise. And 
he sat down, and he had a Bible in his lap, which was

18:26.201 --> 18:32.688
not common for a core sophomore. And I said, can I 
help you? And he said, yes, sir, I wanted to tell

18:34.470 --> 18:36.372
you. I cheated on your final exam last semester. I 
said, oh, really? Tell me about it. Well, he said it

18:41.778 --> 18:51.368
was in the big section, and four of us decided we'd 
each study one-fourth of the material, and then

18:41.778 --> 18:51.368
we'd pass the answers back and forth. Because we 
set up on the back row. Yeah. And because he said, we

18:55.069 --> 18:58.514
don't think anybody else would have done that. I 
said, oh, I bet you're right. I bet nobody else has

18:59.735 --> 19:04.061
ever tried to pass that. And I asked him what his 
average was before the final, and he said 75. I

19:10.629 --> 19:14.134
said, what does the final count? He said 
one-fourth. And I said, how high would you have had

19:16.337 --> 19:19.701
to make on the final to to have raised the 75 to a B.

19:25.248 --> 19:29.813
And how low could you have made and not pull the 75 
down to a C? And he realized, oh. And I said, why are

19:33.237 --> 19:35.920
you telling me this? And he said, well, sir, I'm a 
Baptist. And last night at BSU, we had a missionary

19:39.043 --> 19:49.975
who gave us a Bible study and said, if you have 
sinned against God, get out on your knees tonight.

19:51.035 --> 19:56.200
And if you sinned against one of your fellow men, go 
to that person and confess the sin. And he said,

19:56.220 --> 19:57.240
that's why I'm here. I said, you didn't hurt me. I 
said, you hurt yourself. And he thought I had the

20:05.027 --> 20:08.190
authority to kick him out of school. And I said, if I 
give you an F in this course, he said, when I get

20:08.971 --> 20:16.858
home, my dad's going to beat the hell out of me. And 
he said, we're farmers, so I'll just be farming.

20:21.005 --> 20:22.987
And I said, what have you learned from this? And he 
said, I'll never, never, never do this again.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.434
Yeah. And I said, okay, I'll make a deal with you. As 
of this moment, I will forget your name, and I may

20:31.577 --> 20:39.246
tell this story many times, but I will never, ever, 
ever do it. Yeah. If you will promise me that you'll

20:39.707 --> 20:42.890
never, ever again do it. Yeah. And he shook my hand 
and walked out, and I've always hoped that at some

20:44.132 --> 20:49.678
point... This young man, because this is 30, 35 
years ago, woke up to me. I'd like to know if he

20:53.959 --> 20:56.482
remembers that. Yeah, I bet he did. You know he did. 
All right, you said we were getting people to whom

20:59.346 --> 21:06.937
you feel grateful that had a lifetime effect on 
you. And you mentioned George Thompson last. Some

21:09.481 --> 21:09.962
others? Were there any people that just gave you 
advice? Well, of course, my fellow faculty

21:14.684 --> 21:25.158
members, some of them were very helpful to me to get 
started in this sort of thing, like John Dennison

21:14.684 --> 21:25.158
and, of course, Dillingham. When he left, I took 
over his office in this sort of thing. And Rode, he

21:29.844 --> 21:38.815
wanted me to change out, but I didn't, you know, to 
change and go into education. This is when I was

21:38.875 --> 21:42.180
teaching, but I decided I didn't want to do that. I 
tried it a little bit. Of course, one of the

21:44.806 --> 21:59.042
students I like is one that he came into my office to 
advise, and I was at my desk, and I was kind of

21:44.806 --> 21:59.042
working, and he said, well, you know, would you 
stop and pay attention to me? And I realized I've

21:59.722 --> 22:11.235
got to give him attention, so my desk and then a 
table, and after that I always turned away from my

21:59.722 --> 22:11.235
desk and sat there and gave him my attention. I 
think something as little as that, yeah. As you, do

22:15.863 --> 22:22.929
you remember commencement, your undergraduate 
commencement? We didn't have one because this was

22:22.949 --> 22:27.073
August, so they didn't have one. Dr. Williams 
directed me to plan the first August

22:29.776 --> 22:33.700
commencement. Really? Yeah. He'd gotten two 
letters from two different mothers who had said,

22:35.361 --> 22:41.307
this is not fair. Our child graduated. He's 
graduating this summer and got to wait until

22:44.851 --> 22:47.794
December. They've got a job a long way away. What do 
you think? And I said, I think this is a mandate. And

22:53.040 --> 22:54.802
he said, do you think anybody will show up? Yeah. 
We've proven how much they'll show up. Yeah. So how

23:00.848 --> 23:07.215
well prepared did you feel you were when you 
graduated? How well prepared did you think A&M had

23:07.496 --> 23:09.758
been? Well, I was very much an average student, and 
I really feel like I was, a

23:12.607 --> 23:25.399
good place that I went was when I went in more into 
sales. I really don't, I really, I was exposed to

23:26.039 --> 23:36.349
all of it, but I really knew that I couldn't get into 
something highly technical. While I was in the

23:37.409 --> 23:42.394
service room, while I was in research in 
Arlington, Virginia, after the war was over, but I

23:42.627 --> 23:48.774
really, I couldn't do much then originally, this 
sort of thing. So I guess I'm not a typical

23:49.755 --> 23:52.157
graduate. And I, wonderful the way I've turned 
out. I mean, how I fell into this job here and how I

23:55.661 --> 24:05.232
felt that I really did a good job with the students 
and this sort of thing. Of course, the recognition

24:05.292 --> 24:08.095
I got and Did A&M help you get that first job? No, 
uh-uh. At that time, of course, you had all these

24:13.752 --> 24:19.798
different companies coming in and interviewing, 
and they had nothing to do with it. No, and as I say,

24:19.818 --> 24:37.896
because the guy I was going to work for had worked 
with my father and so forth, and he wanted me, they

24:19.818 --> 24:37.896
were hiring a lot of double E's then, but as it 
turned out, we couldn't make much use of it, and I

24:19.818 --> 24:37.896
was traveling, and I really wasn't, and I had a 
chance, I talked to Randy

24:38.332 --> 24:43.137
Mattson. I don't know, I guess you'd, Walt 
Mattson. You remember him? Okay. But anyway, I

24:48.021 --> 24:55.428
talked to him that spring because they had taken 
some of my accounts away from me, the telephone

24:48.021 --> 24:55.428
companies, incidentally. And I said, well, I'm 
not using my engineering. And I talked to him. He

25:00.213 --> 25:02.735
says, well, no, you just got your BS. And on 
Wednesday before classes in September, he says,

25:03.216 --> 25:07.900
go around and see MC Hughes. He might have a job for 
you. I went over to see him, and they hired me at

25:09.796 --> 25:12.959
lunchtime. I called Houston and went down and 
resigned on Friday and helped with registration

25:13.059 --> 25:18.964
on Saturday. That first job out of A&M, what was the 
pay? Do you remember? $190 a month, and they were

25:24.789 --> 25:30.034
scraping pretty good.

25:32.956 --> 25:33.457
Let's see. Now let's see. Let's see. Did you buy an 
Aggie ring? I have an Aggie ring. How much did it

25:42.245 --> 25:43.707
cost, do you remember? Oh, back in those days, 
about $25. And was the ritual the same then as now,

25:45.468 --> 25:52.135
that almost everybody bought a ring? Oh, very 
definitely. In fact, some guys would get somebody

25:54.077 --> 25:58.641
else to buy a ring and give it to them. That's how 
important it was. All right. Let's see, one that I

26:04.934 --> 26:09.199
see I missed here, Aggie Bonfire. Was there a 
bonfire your freshman year? Oh yeah, there was

26:11.561 --> 26:13.303
always a bonfire. Where was it? It was out on the 
drill field. And there was nothing much at all to

26:16.486 --> 26:18.288
it. You know, this is awful what they do now, but we 
got the railroads to bring in stuff for us. And it

26:24.815 --> 26:26.317
was trash then, wasn't it? About all it was. And 
we'd go and cut down a few trees. Let's see, I've

26:32.288 --> 26:34.392
heard Mr. Rudder talk about trying to shoot out 
that light bulb up on top of the- I've heard that

26:34.472 --> 26:40.943
too. Was that done? No, no, I don't think so. Okay.

26:48.996 --> 26:51.340
Let's see, we've already talked about hard 
lickers. Okay, now let's, you came as a faculty

26:52.643 --> 26:55.948
member in what year? It'd be the fall of 56th. And 
this is the last one I'm going to ask of dollars and

26:58.765 --> 27:01.288
cents. Do you remember what the pay was when you 
started? $500 a month, I think. Maybe $550, I don't

27:07.416 --> 27:10.760
know. And what was your title? Well, I was an 
instructor. And what were your first duties? What

27:19.371 --> 27:20.313
was my what? First duty. What were you assigned to 
teach? Oh, okay. First term sophomore course. And

27:27.841 --> 27:36.157
then labs, and a 307 course, which is for the 
mechanical engineers, with the labs. And for a

27:37.259 --> 27:44.893
number of years, we had the labs as well as the 
theory, which was great, because this is really

27:37.259 --> 27:44.893
where you got acquainted with them. So that was my 
first semester. Nineteen contact hours. In

27:50.875 --> 27:52.497
double E or in double E? In double E. Oh, yeah, I 
stayed in double E. About how many were there, how

27:52.697 --> 27:58.303
many faculty in the department field? Oh, eight or 
nine, I guess. And you all were housed, where were

28:01.446 --> 28:04.629
you all housed? Oh, in Bolton Hall. In Bolton. And 
how would you compare the students that you had

28:07.652 --> 28:20.325
that first year with the

28:07.652 --> 28:20.325
students that were here when you arrived? Were 
they better prepared than y'all were? Oh, I think

28:24.224 --> 28:31.976
that what was really nice when I came back is you had 
Corps and you had veterans. The veterans were very

28:32.657 --> 28:34.740
much dedicated. And so as a result, the Corps was 
too. They were good students. Because these were

28:40.028 --> 28:41.891
Korean War veterans. These would have been Korean 
War veterans in the mid-50s. Oh yeah, Korean War.

28:47.479 --> 28:49.182
And so... A day for you as a faculty member began at 
about what time and when did a day? Oh, 8 o'clock

28:55.455 --> 28:56.697
till 5. Yeah, the collabs would go on to 5. Who was 
the department head? M.C. Hughes. Describe him as

29:03.063 --> 29:04.924
a... They called him Tubby. Tubby Hughes, he was a 
big heavy man, and he had gone through the test

29:07.407 --> 29:17.937
course, that is, with GE and this sort of thing, 
and... I guess he came on back fairly soon after

29:18.659 --> 29:25.787
that and was the department head for a number of 
years. Who was the dean of engineering?

29:28.270 --> 29:28.871
Gilchrist. And the dean of the faculty was Bolton. 
And the president, Walton. Oh, yeah. And in what

29:39.263 --> 29:44.549
manner did Professor Hughes lead the department? 
Was he authoritarian? Was he democratic? Oh, I

29:48.359 --> 29:51.182
think he was very fair and everything. He 
certainly was fair to me. And I think he just was a

29:53.064 --> 29:58.148
very regular type of department head. How, all 
right, then we're doing a broad survey now of all

29:58.889 --> 30:03.053
your years. How did the Department of Engineering 
attempt to stay up to date with what it offered?

30:12.903 --> 30:17.607
Well, of course, prior to up to World War II, 
through the war, you still, as we were concerned,

30:18.548 --> 30:24.453
in power, not much on electronics. And they were 
all teaching very much traditional courses,

30:25.494 --> 30:32.100
mechanical, civil, chemical, and this sort of 
thing. The chemical engineering department was

30:32.160 --> 30:34.342
pretty new. It was part of the chemistry 
department until about World War II. And so it was a

30:39.527 --> 30:45.733
very stable type of curriculum. But what about 
after the war? How did... Well, of course, once the

30:48.400 --> 30:58.631
transistor came in and they started doing this 
sort of thing, then the whole picture changed. And

30:59.351 --> 31:11.744
then, of course, all the field theory and much more 
emphasis on electronics, on communications,

30:59.351 --> 31:11.744
such as that. And so gradually it downplayed the 
the power because this is not where most of the

31:15.029 --> 31:18.794
students go anymore. Was there any program to give 
you as a new faculty member any orientation? You

31:26.825 --> 31:27.766
and your wife? Not a bit. But my wife's very 
personal and she already knew a lot of the faculty

31:30.970 --> 31:36.338
and this sort of thing. Where did y'all live? We 
lived on 103 Dexter. This is the last block before

31:41.985 --> 31:44.749
you
