WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:06.080
...working, hoping that the battery is still up. 
Let's see, and today is the 11th of June, Thursday,

00:14.920 --> 00:19.600
and I have the pleasure of being at Cala Vista and 
talking to Les Appelt, one of the most generous,

00:20.440 --> 00:24.040
thoughtful Aggies of all time. Les, why did you 
attend A&M in the first place? Why there? There

00:29.950 --> 00:32.497
were probably two reasons. My brother had 
attended A&M, a very devoted Aggie. He was several

00:42.180 --> 00:51.070
years ahead of me, and the other was probably 
largely economic.

00:55.250 --> 01:01.170
It was probably the least costly major college to 
attend. My economics in my first two years at A&M

01:01.590 --> 01:13.880
were covered by the savings I had,

01:17.930 --> 01:24.230
college for two years, at Hollisville.

01:28.220 --> 01:35.590
Skills I had with a, which was simply a fast-moving 
A&M machine,

01:44.140 --> 01:52.290
I managed to save the

01:44.140 --> 01:52.290
beneficent sum of about six or seven hundred 
dollars in two years. Now

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
you

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
entered

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
as

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
a freshman

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
in the

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
fall

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
of, fall

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
of 36.

03:27.700 --> 03:31.700
You had visited the campus a number of times before 
enrolling. Several times. When you went, to

03:36.680 --> 03:38.700
enroll, how did you get there? On the train, the 
bus? No, I left my folks in the back

03:41.140 --> 03:53.840
seat. Yeah, now, what were the, what did you take 
with you, in terms of clothing and supplies? You

03:58.640 --> 04:30.380
see, at that time, uniforms were, it

03:58.640 --> 04:30.380
was so

03:58.640 --> 04:30.380
inconsequential

03:58.640 --> 04:30.380
that I don't remember what I did. Describe, if you 
can, how you were received. How did you get in a

04:34.675 --> 04:39.800
dormitory, get in a unit, get enrolled? I

04:39.780 --> 04:55.580
remember not really too good on that, except that

04:39.780 --> 04:55.580
the dormitory, assignment had been made, and I 
knew where to go. By

05:00.280 --> 05:16.180
the sophomores,

05:00.280 --> 05:16.180
either began giving us instructions on 
campusology, that

05:16.160 --> 05:24.800
we do anything right. The

05:24.780 --> 05:34.380
fact that I had this job at Vessel Hall caused some 
confusion among our sophomores. We

05:34.360 --> 05:58.060
were, luckily we were in

05:34.360 --> 05:58.060
Hall

05:34.360 --> 05:58.060
dormitory which was fortunate for me to just 
directly cross the street. It was the reason why

05:58.040 --> 06:02.140
the Hall. Yeah. The fact that I had to go to Nassau 
exempted me from marching in with the outfit,

06:03.503 --> 06:14.850
which annoyed the sophomores going in. So, it 
turned out that about once a month,

06:14.830 --> 06:24.300
they would have a special session. At

06:24.280 --> 06:30.780
that time, it would come to known as ass-tears. My 
transgressions.

06:39.129 --> 06:42.480
I've been fortunate enough to have a job at Nassau. 
I'll

06:42.460 --> 06:57.620
show you how far the university

06:42.460 --> 06:57.620
progressed.

06:57.600 --> 07:02.780
We were reserved for football.

07:02.760 --> 07:13.090
We had John Kimbrough, Ralph, and all the freshmen 
that got to know the football players. I

07:13.070 --> 07:29.160
think they stayed in there as my freshman and 
sophomore

07:13.070 --> 07:29.160
year. It's as simple as you can now have. Can you 
describe a typical dormitory room at that time?

07:38.990 --> 07:40.031
How was it furnished? How big was it? What did you 
all have in it? Typical there was two rooms. It was

07:47.670 --> 08:03.080
just basically a shop. The floors

08:03.060 --> 08:22.040
were

08:03.060 --> 08:22.040
plastered

08:03.060 --> 08:22.040
and painted. There

08:22.020 --> 08:27.160
was bunk beds. The size of

08:27.140 --> 08:38.780
the room, I'd say, there was room for rainbows. I'd 
say we could have two desks. I'd say the room was

08:41.900 --> 08:44.920
about 10, about 12. So, no rug, no curtains? Not 
really. We brought in anything like that. We let

08:50.500 --> 08:53.960
them do that ourselves. Usually, we had to, 
somehow or another, we always had to throw up

08:53.940 --> 09:00.780
something. So, we'd hit the deck in the bed. It 
wouldn't be on that cold floor. Describe the

09:04.820 --> 09:08.840
campus physically when you arrived. What was 
there? There

09:09.820 --> 09:29.120
was quite a bit of space between the main door and 
the library. There

09:29.100 --> 09:38.700
was a true library in that main building. Across 
the street was now the ladies'

09:38.680 --> 09:50.370
dormitory. The building that was used in the 
animal husbandry department. Possibly

09:55.140 --> 10:01.610
for study or demonstration. It had some lots 
there. And they stored hay in it. And they had

10:07.590 --> 10:12.610
majors there where they'd feed the animals. I 
remember that very, very, very, because shortly

10:12.590 --> 10:24.950
after all

10:12.590 --> 10:24.950
the freshmen came in, and I think maybe a day or two 
before actually school started, they aired all

10:24.930 --> 10:29.950
the freshmen out. Describe airing out the 
freshmen. Airing out the freshmen was just, well,

10:33.750 --> 10:46.670
they just literally

10:33.750 --> 10:46.670
chased you out of your room. They'd

10:46.650 --> 10:55.040
have you and the sophomores there to keep you from 
coming back in. And then all the sophomores, all of

10:55.020 --> 11:03.120
the campers started hunting down the freshmen.

11:03.100 --> 11:13.330
And

11:03.100 --> 11:13.330
they caught most of them.

11:13.310 --> 11:24.380
Long

11:13.310 --> 11:24.380
sessions with them.

11:24.360 --> 12:50.000
Those

11:24.360 --> 12:50.000
big

11:24.360 --> 12:50.000
open areas on the east side of the campus that now 
are the golf course and the bonfire area. What were

12:49.980 --> 12:52.000
those used for? Drill fields. Were those used for 
drill fields then? Well, not so much

12:53.980 --> 13:35.890
were

12:53.980 --> 13:35.890
used.

13:35.870 --> 13:46.290
The engineers used

13:35.870 --> 13:46.290
them. Engineering.

14:03.292 --> 14:09.740
That area was reserved for military instruction. 
How were freshmen treated in general? The

14:12.720 --> 14:35.620
juniors and

14:12.720 --> 14:35.620
seniors sought to, the sophomores treated the 
freshmen with bomb leaves. Exert

14:35.600 --> 14:53.010
a predominant attitude was wiped out. I don't know 
of any freshmen that ever went through that area

14:52.990 --> 15:03.360
that didn't accept an inferior position. I

15:03.340 --> 15:15.620
think Evol was put inside and negative 
psychology. That you can't get over. How often was

15:18.600 --> 15:22.180
a board used? Not near as often as...

15:30.140 --> 15:40.360
And it was a fair sized piece of wood.

15:40.340 --> 15:45.360
Did you ever get hit by a board when you hadn't done 
anything? Oh, absolutely. Normally, how many

15:48.107 --> 16:00.460
licks would there be?

16:00.440 --> 16:07.100
The worst experience I had was the board in my 
junior year. There was a tradition that sergeant

16:07.080 --> 16:18.520
stripes, golf stripes, whatever. I was made a tech 
sergeant, which was five stripes. And

16:27.320 --> 16:41.240
then

16:27.320 --> 16:41.240
three days later, I was promoted to master 
sergeant.

16:41.220 --> 16:53.390
My contention was that the juniors

16:41.220 --> 16:53.390
and seniors had, I mean the seniors had, the 
seniors did this. The seniors had

16:53.370 --> 17:18.100
balls.

17:18.080 --> 17:45.210
Fifth year senior

17:18.080 --> 17:45.210
named

17:18.080 --> 17:45.210
Kent.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.210
Obvious reason, because I guess he knew I 
protested him. Made a fatal error. Blood

17:54.560 --> 18:43.480
came in

17:54.560 --> 18:43.480
through

17:54.560 --> 18:43.480
his...

18:43.460 --> 18:50.110
How satisfied I was about that whole

18:43.460 --> 18:50.110
thing. And your outfit was E? It was E, engineers. 
Now, I wasn't sure about

18:57.350 --> 19:09.750
the mess hall job. But I registered late. And they 
informed me of a new company. And instead of being

19:15.630 --> 19:24.080
Walton Hall, that company was in PG Hall, which is 
an old wood building adjacent to it. That was

19:24.060 --> 19:38.400
really a,

19:24.060 --> 19:38.400
really

19:24.060 --> 19:38.400
a heartbreaker for me. I didn't want to take it out 
of the company. But it was just one of those things

19:44.340 --> 19:48.240
that happened, and I couldn't do anything about 
it. But it turned out that F Company had got some

19:48.220 --> 19:59.920
pretty good juniors and seniors. Unusually good 
bunches. We had a strong bunch of sophomores. And

20:03.900 --> 20:09.560
so by the time I was a senior, F Company was back up 
in... I

20:09.540 --> 20:22.140
had been

20:09.540 --> 20:22.140
selected as... It had been... It

20:24.120 --> 20:32.960
was a high-morality one. Got a mayoral 
championship my senior year. By that time, I was

20:35.940 --> 20:45.980
glad that I'd been a year at PG Hall and got an F 
company. What did PG stand for? You're

20:47.960 --> 20:53.200
saying the initials, P... That's good. That's a 
good one. I don't remember. Okay. All right. I

20:58.400 --> 20:59.421
haven't heard that. Did your outfits have 
nicknames? E and F? No. Not really. Spider D and

21:04.580 --> 21:05.601
things like that? Yeah. That's... All right. Were 
they both engineering companies? Yes. He was an

21:09.968 --> 21:11.600
engineer regiment with six guys. All right. 
Now... Two battalions, three... Describe the

21:17.480 --> 21:24.500
routine of a typical Monday through Friday day. 
Got up at what time? Did what when? Take me through

21:26.480 --> 21:28.780
the whole day. Eat.

21:34.164 --> 22:09.490
You

21:34.164 --> 22:09.490
had

21:34.164 --> 22:09.490
a job and... They

22:09.470 --> 23:10.810
had a

22:09.470 --> 23:10.810
special

22:09.470 --> 23:10.810
session

22:09.470 --> 23:10.810
with

22:09.470 --> 23:10.810
me.

23:10.790 --> 23:22.784
All right.

23:23.085 --> 23:25.030
So would you... You'd get over there early, work. 
Yeah. And you'd go to the dorm before your eight

23:27.275 --> 23:29.030
o'clock class? Yeah. I'd hit the dorm, decide what 
you

23:30.012 --> 23:53.190
wanted

23:30.012 --> 23:53.190
to do, then you had to go from one place to another to 
sign up. And about half the time when you got there,

23:54.170 --> 23:59.190
the section that you had chosen to fill in your 
schedule was full. So then you had to revise your

24:00.170 --> 24:06.200
schedule, go chasing around until you found the 
section wasn't

24:06.180 --> 24:12.247
full. It was in Friday classes, Thursday

24:12.307 --> 24:31.570
and

24:12.307 --> 24:31.570
Saturday classes that were left and if you didn't 
get

24:34.550 --> 24:39.150
I'd say it's a damn good thing because with 40,000 
students against the 4,000 or 5,000 that we had,

24:39.130 --> 24:40.751
our system would have to have disintegrated. 
Total confusion. All right. In

24:42.730 --> 24:55.710
this routine,

24:42.730 --> 24:55.710
you go to class. What

24:55.690 --> 25:19.860
did you do if you didn't have a class say at 10 
o'clock? What did you do with that off hour? Well,

25:20.840 --> 25:41.260
because I was a sophomore,

25:20.840 --> 25:41.260
you're supposed to come back

25:20.840 --> 25:41.260
and be available. Right. Then you'd come back. 
Then after

25:43.240 --> 25:53.620
lunch and when you didn't have classes in the 
afternoon, what did you do with your afternoons?

25:55.600 --> 26:12.520
Where

25:55.600 --> 26:12.520
would you take that now? This

26:12.500 --> 26:54.680
side

26:12.500 --> 26:54.680
of the tracks.

26:54.660 --> 26:55.222
East. It wasn't about three or four hundred yards 
from my home. I drove down to Northgate

27:03.950 --> 27:12.260
about a quarter mile to Walter Bryan and worked my 
way back along the railroad track. And then I'd

27:14.240 --> 27:23.150
come into the back part of this and go

27:14.240 --> 27:23.150
take a nap. That's another thing that they were 
probably right about by giving me special

27:23.130 --> 27:29.000
attention. Eating cushions, sitting off taking 
naps. Both very, very bad deals. All right. The

27:36.558 --> 27:42.210
routine of the military drills, when did those 
occur and where? We had a military science class.

27:46.940 --> 28:11.080
It

27:46.940 --> 28:11.080
was an evening

27:46.940 --> 28:11.080
formation.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.461
They had a freshman. I was a freshman out there. 
See, I missed that. Another sin. Duly castigated.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.461
And I do, I kind of miss the drill. I never really did 
learn to drill well. I wanted consideration. I

28:24.070 --> 28:53.800
figured if I was out in front

28:24.070 --> 28:53.800
by myself,

28:24.070 --> 28:53.800
nobody would notice that I was out of step.

28:53.780 --> 28:57.804
We had a long way to go. We had squads and platoons, 
squad right, squad left, and not

28:58.765 --> 29:12.819
the Army Drill. The Army Drill came

29:13.159 --> 29:24.010
in during the time.

29:24.030 --> 29:34.240
I was not the most skilled freshman,

29:24.030 --> 29:34.240
but they beat me out of step. But

29:34.220 --> 29:42.573
we suffered through

29:34.220 --> 29:42.573
that. Really, then you ate, you went back to your 
room, you studied. If you weren't studying, you'd

29:52.749 --> 30:00.180
better be sitting in your desk with a book in front 
of you. Now the freshmen are always tired. They're

30:02.246 --> 30:04.934
always sleeping. And so one of the great sins would 
be caught up to death with your head down on your arm

30:04.954 --> 30:11.153
asleep. That usually ended up with me. Let's

30:13.460 --> 30:21.220
see, in your outfit, who were some special friends 
that you made? Oh, I... I still...

30:41.300 --> 30:56.620
Any of

30:41.300 --> 30:56.620
the ones that you...

30:56.600 --> 31:00.207
Describe some of the, you mentioned some of the 
athletes. Who were the notable student, students

31:00.227 --> 31:12.913
on the campus then?

31:13.053 --> 31:16.500
Was John Kimbrough a noticeable, did everybody 
know who he was? Oh yeah, everybody knew.
