WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:08.746
Hoping that the battery is still up.

00:08.926 --> 00:24.045
Today is the 11th of June, Thursday, and have the pleasure of being at Cala Vista and talking to Les Appelt, one of the most generous, thoughtful Aggies of all time.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.911
Les, why did you attend A&M in the first place?

00:29.471 --> 00:30.072
Why there?

00:31.553 --> 00:32.474
Probably two reasons.

00:32.574 --> 00:41.327
My brother had attended A&M and was a very devoted Aggie.

00:42.508 --> 00:45.533
He was several years ahead of me.

00:46.714 --> 00:51.101
And the other was probably largely economic.

00:52.082 --> 01:01.375
At that time Texas A&M was probably the least costly major college to attend.

01:01.912 --> 01:19.255
My economics in my first two years at A&M were covered by the savings I had made by staying out of college for two years.

01:20.117 --> 01:31.632
I worked in a law office in Hallisville and then due to some skills I had with a marching computer,

01:32.101 --> 01:36.767
what they called it that time, which was simply a fast-moving air machine.

01:37.808 --> 01:55.050
I computed acreages for the AAA program and I managed to save the magnificent sum of about six or seven hundred dollars in two years working.

01:57.192 --> 02:00.977
Weldon, that's my brother, had done a

02:01.480 --> 02:17.303
volunteer and with that connection I was one of the very few freshmen that were given a job as a Meso waiter.

02:17.924 --> 02:27.859
That paid probably about twenty-five, twenty-six dollars a month and the

02:28.143 --> 02:38.161
fee for room and board and laundry was about 29 if I remember it at that time.

02:38.181 --> 02:48.819
I don't recall just what I did in my freshman year, but I kept track of what I did in my sophomore year and it cost me 350 dollars to go to school in my sophomore year.

02:48.839 --> 02:51.564
That's all the cash that I spent.

02:51.664 --> 02:53.307
Plus the fact that

02:54.181 --> 03:04.560
My mother and dad would write me a letter every week and enclose a crystal bill in it, which cost him spending money.

03:06.203 --> 03:08.927
And greater than not, I even saved money on that.

03:08.947 --> 03:15.379
Now you entered as a freshman in the fall of... I entered in 1937.

03:17.401 --> 03:18.762
Fall of 36, I guess.

03:18.782 --> 03:19.443
Fall of 36.

03:20.444 --> 03:23.166
Class of 37.

03:23.186 --> 03:24.888
Graduated in 40-year-old.

03:24.908 --> 03:25.748
So, okay.

03:28.151 --> 03:31.954
You had visited the campus a number of times before enrolling.

03:32.755 --> 03:33.455
Several times.

03:35.297 --> 03:38.560
When you went to enroll, how did you get there?

03:39.741 --> 03:40.942
On the train, the bus?

03:41.342 --> 03:46.547
No, a lot of folks took me, I think at that time, the dad had a

03:47.152 --> 03:54.746
a Dodge Touring car and they took me out and loaded all my few possessions in the back seat.

03:55.047 --> 03:58.493
What did you take with you in terms of clothing and supplies?

03:58.554 --> 04:01.699
See at that time uniforms were furnished.

04:05.146 --> 04:08.873
So I took I suppose

04:10.793 --> 04:23.468
Mostly underwear and maybe my toothbrush and toilet items and a safe derasure.

04:23.868 --> 04:26.972
We traveled pretty light.

04:26.992 --> 04:31.497
In fact, it was so inconsequential that I don't remember what I did.

04:31.517 --> 04:34.461
Describe, if you can, how you were received.

04:34.661 --> 04:39.687
How did you get in a dormitory, get in a unit, get enrolled?

04:41.067 --> 05:10.467
Well, memory's not really too good on that except that the dormitory assignment had been made and I knew where to go and where to unload and of course the freshmen were greeted by the sophomores

05:11.543 --> 05:16.189
who immediately began giving us instructions in campusology.

05:19.033 --> 05:24.361
And there for a number of days, of course, there's no way a freshman could do anything right.

05:25.402 --> 05:27.666
So, I'm a freshman.

05:27.686 --> 05:31.611
The fact that I had this job in this hole,

05:32.435 --> 06:02.391
caused some confusion among our sophomores and our company, which was Company E. And we were, luckily, we were in the brand new Baltimore Hall dormitory, which was fortunate for me to just directly cross the street from Old Subisa Hall.

06:02.793 --> 06:14.689
The fact that I had a good vessel exempted me from marching in with the outfit which annoyed the sophomores no end.

06:15.691 --> 06:25.464
So it turned out that about once a month they would have a special session for me.

06:26.986 --> 06:32.293
And at that time it would commonly known as ass tears.

06:32.712 --> 06:38.098
So they'd all sit around and remind me of all my transgressions.

06:39.219 --> 06:49.630
I haven't been fortunate enough to have a job in Nessau to show you how far the university progressed.

06:50.691 --> 06:59.901
The first two ramps in Walton Hall, A and B, were reserved for football teams.

07:01.130 --> 07:09.839
And that was in the years when we had John Kimbrough and Ralph and company.

07:09.999 --> 07:17.286
And so we got all the freshmen got to know all the football players real good.

07:17.306 --> 07:27.916
And I think they stayed in there my freshman, sophomore year and I think they got some other facilities for them.

07:27.936 --> 07:30.799
But it was a whole lot different from the facilities we now have.

07:31.690 --> 07:38.439
Can you describe a typical dormitory room at that time?

07:39.059 --> 07:40.001
How was it furnished?

07:40.021 --> 07:40.962
How big was it?

07:41.603 --> 07:42.624
What did you all have in it?

07:42.664 --> 07:53.338
Typical there was the two rooms with a shower and baths.

07:55.541 --> 07:58.204
The lavatory was in the room.

07:59.517 --> 08:01.279
So it was just basically the showers.

08:03.162 --> 08:15.259
The floors were concrete.

08:15.419 --> 08:18.844
It had the special texture on it.

08:18.864 --> 08:22.369
The rhubarb we just plastered and painted.

08:23.311 --> 08:33.742
And there was a double bunk beds in each room.

08:33.762 --> 08:35.384
So each room had two people.

08:36.445 --> 08:39.428
The size of the room, I'd say, mm-hmm.

08:39.448 --> 08:40.129
There was room for rain rooms.

08:42.051 --> 08:43.693
That's where we could have two desks.

08:43.713 --> 08:45.295
And I'd say the room was about 10 by 12.

08:45.315 --> 08:47.096
So no rug, no curtains?

08:47.357 --> 08:53.183
Not, if we brought in anything like that, we'd have to do that ourselves.

08:54.243 --> 09:09.379
Describe the campus physically when you arrived.

09:09.499 --> 09:12.422
What was there?

09:12.442 --> 09:22.512
Well, I feel like there was quite a bit of space between what's now known as the Japanese building.

09:23.217 --> 09:40.118
And the old main door, the library was there.

09:40.139 --> 09:41.220
They had a true library in that big building.

09:41.240 --> 09:51.553
Across the street from what's now the ladies, was a building.

09:52.934 --> 10:02.944
that was used in the animal hood loop department, possibly for study or demonstration.

10:05.066 --> 10:13.835
It had some lots there and they stored hay in it and they had mangers there where they feed these animals.

10:13.855 --> 10:21.743
I remember that very, very, very well because shortly after

10:23.123 --> 10:32.913
All the freshmen came in and I think maybe a day or two before actually school started, they aired all the freshmen out.

10:32.953 --> 10:35.035
Now describe airing out the freshmen.

10:35.055 --> 10:52.033
Airing out the freshmen is just telling them that they just literally chased you out of your room and posted

10:52.368 --> 11:21.160
sophomores there to keep you coming back in and then all the sophomores on campus started hunting down the freshmen being and they caught most of them and they had long sessions with them usually with the freshmen ending up being accused of being

11:22.186 --> 11:42.029
uncooperative or say-say or whatever in order to be assessed the punishments all the way from using the board on to push-ups and miscellaneous other indignities.

11:43.151 --> 11:51.180
I had noticed this building I was picking up that Adam Huckley had, so when they aired me out,

11:51.768 --> 11:56.672
took a circuitous route and beat it down there at high speed.

11:57.693 --> 12:12.266
I spent the night in one of the mangers with a nice soft hay cushion under me and actually even though all the husbands were going around, I actually fell asleep.

12:12.286 --> 12:20.593
And the sophomore did come through there but I had a whole bunch of hay over me.

12:20.962 --> 12:23.965
And I survived that night very well.

12:23.985 --> 12:25.747
I still remember that building.

12:25.767 --> 12:42.685
But right now I think the building is probably Teague building was on top of that site.

12:42.705 --> 12:44.927
Those big open areas.

12:45.413 --> 12:51.400
on the east side of the campus that now are the golf course and the bonfire area, what were... Drill fields.

12:51.420 --> 12:53.062
Were those used for drill fields then?

12:53.122 --> 12:54.083
Well, not so much for either.

12:54.263 --> 13:02.993
The drill field that was used most was the one between the library and the Jack Williams building.

13:03.013 --> 13:04.335
That was a huge drill field there.

13:04.355 --> 13:14.627
And that would have been just over to the north of where there's small drill fields.

13:16.210 --> 13:34.994
The area where the golf course is, and on both sides of the road leading in the main building, we use for various sundry military science projects.

13:35.014 --> 13:38.018
The engineers use them largely in mapping.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.585
We do plane table mapping, we do

13:44.307 --> 14:04.173
Lots of engineering activities, demonstrations on bridge building and road building and also on beam missions.

14:04.693 --> 14:09.239
But that area was reserved for military instruction.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.964
How were freshmen treated in general?

14:15.121 --> 14:22.050
for the junior and seniors treated the freshmen quite well.

14:22.070 --> 14:39.092
But they can't have their hands washed because they sought to, the sophomores treated the freshmen abominably.

14:40.694 --> 14:43.778
And any effort whatsoever for a freshman to

14:45.192 --> 14:57.205
exert a predominant attitude was wiped out.

14:57.225 --> 15:07.336
I don't know any freshmen that ever went through that area that didn't accept an inferior position.

15:09.539 --> 15:14.524
I think they've always put insight into negative psychology

15:15.145 --> 15:18.390
And she can't get over work.

15:18.410 --> 15:19.753
How often was the board used?

15:21.856 --> 15:29.789
Not near as often as recruited, but there was no really restriction.

15:29.809 --> 15:33.055
And it was a fair sized piece of wood.

15:33.575 --> 15:38.824
Yeah, some of them were shaved down in baseball bats.

15:40.222 --> 15:44.989
Did you ever get hit by a board when you hadn't done anything?

15:45.890 --> 15:46.591
Oh, absolutely.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.755
Normally, how many licks would there be?

15:52.419 --> 15:58.327
Well, usually, maybe in order of three to five.

15:58.347 --> 16:00.049
And that connection brings up another thing.

16:00.690 --> 16:07.079
The worst experience I had with the board was in my junior year.

16:08.641 --> 16:10.043
There was a tradition that

16:12.166 --> 16:22.400
When you got promoted, and you got sergeant stripes, copper stripes, whatever you got, that they tacked those on.

16:23.962 --> 16:27.006
I was made a tech sergeant with his fire stripes.

16:31.732 --> 16:34.716
And they put those on.

16:34.736 --> 16:40.924
And then three days later, I was promoted to master sergeant.

16:41.444 --> 16:48.591
My contention was that they could put one more stripe on it.

16:48.611 --> 16:50.773
The juniors and seniors had it.

16:50.813 --> 16:51.994
I mean, the seniors had it.

16:52.014 --> 16:52.715
The seniors did this.

16:53.456 --> 17:01.864
The seniors, in all their wisdom, said, no, we have to knock the five off and then put the six on.

17:03.385 --> 17:10.472
So then, in about three or four days, you get all that up, they got 16 licks from each of the seniors.

17:11.498 --> 17:25.455
Most of them were pretty moderate-taps, but there was a fifth-year senior named Kancelowski that was, if you please, a real chicken kid.

17:27.258 --> 17:36.229
The fact is, we finally found him guilty of stealing some earmarks at the end of the semester, and I think we heard him out.

17:36.249 --> 17:40.594
But anyway, he...

17:41.924 --> 17:44.427
didn't really take to me.

17:44.447 --> 17:50.956
There was obvious reason because I guess he knew I detested him.

17:50.976 --> 17:54.440
But at any rate, he made a fatal error.

17:55.722 --> 17:57.224
He hit me low.

17:59.307 --> 18:05.395
And as you know, pretty good sized guy.

18:05.415 --> 18:11.763
And he was one of the shaved down baseball guys.

18:11.803 --> 18:11.863
And

18:12.164 --> 18:23.157
So I pulled the thing, pulled my pants down, and I had stripes across my legs that missed the buttocks.

18:23.177 --> 18:32.509
And so he had to permit me to pop him on it.

18:32.529 --> 18:36.974
I didn't have broke him down his hole.

18:36.994 --> 18:41.580
And blood came in through his pants.

18:42.100 --> 18:46.525
That would, I still recall how satisfied I was about that whole deal.

18:47.386 --> 18:49.128
These are the little things that would occur.

18:50.510 --> 18:53.534
In the, now your outfit was E?

18:54.875 --> 18:56.597
It was E-Engineers.

18:56.858 --> 18:57.578
E-Engineers.

18:57.599 --> 19:06.789
Now the, I wasn't sure that I was going to get to come back the second year of the finances.

19:06.810 --> 19:11.415
There was some doubt about the mess whole job and I don't recall a little details.

19:11.716 --> 19:32.078
But I registered late, and they had formed a new company, and instead of being Walton Hall, that company was in PG Hall, which was an old wood building adjacent to the Walton Hall, down there where the Dooley Battle building was down.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.502
And so we, F-Comp was going on.

19:35.522 --> 19:40.828
That was really a heartbreaker for me at the time.

19:41.652 --> 19:48.724
I couldn't do anything about it.

19:49.445 --> 20:01.265
But it turned out that F Company had got some pretty good juniors and seniors at that time and unusually good bunches.

20:02.527 --> 20:05.432
We had a strong bunch of sophomores.

20:06.712 --> 20:20.652
So far, by the time I was a senior F company, I was back up in the corner ramp closest to the mess hall to me.

20:20.672 --> 20:26.381
And I hadn't selected as, it happened, we sent a terminal to command engineer regiment.

20:26.401 --> 20:32.770
So, F company, I really was a company, High Morality,

20:33.037 --> 20:38.243
in the World Championship my senior year.

20:38.263 --> 20:46.012
By that time I was glad that I had been a year at PG and old and got an F company.

20:46.032 --> 20:47.373
What did PG stand for?

20:51.718 --> 20:52.719
You're saying the initials.

20:53.380 --> 20:56.463
That's a good one.

20:56.543 --> 20:57.164
I don't remember.

20:57.224 --> 20:57.845
I haven't heard that.

20:58.385 --> 21:00.748
Did your outfits have nicknames?

21:01.336 --> 21:02.117
E and F?

21:02.457 --> 21:03.859
No, not really.

21:03.999 --> 21:07.342
Like I've heard of Spider D and things like that.

21:07.363 --> 21:09.004
Were they both engineering companies?

21:09.765 --> 21:13.509
Yes, he was an engineer regiment with six companies.

21:13.549 --> 21:17.513
Two battalions, three companies each.

21:17.974 --> 21:24.181
Describe the routine of a typical Monday through Friday day.

21:24.681 --> 21:26.483
Got up at what time, did what, when.

21:27.684 --> 21:29.166
Take me through the whole day.

21:30.142 --> 21:35.306
I'm not real sure about the exact times, but it was getting up pretty damn early.

21:36.648 --> 21:42.573
I'd say we'd be riding out somewhere around 6.30 or 7.

21:42.593 --> 21:48.097
And of course out here with the missile, the units would form up in the straight and march in.

21:49.038 --> 21:58.546
I think the march in was probably somewhere between 7.00, 7.14 probably, maybe 7.30.

21:58.566 --> 21:59.727
The classes started at 8.

22:00.196 --> 22:04.440
So probably about 7 or 15.

22:04.460 --> 22:06.742
Eating then did take a long time.

22:07.362 --> 22:08.223
How did you eat?

22:08.283 --> 22:14.589
You had a job and... Well, I ate in a hell of a hurry.

22:15.610 --> 22:16.871
And I still have a bad habit.

22:19.854 --> 22:26.980
I had a certain table and my normal meal time was less than five minutes.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.022
We'd finish and we'd be ready.

22:29.457 --> 22:38.006
One of the advantages of being in the mess hall, and one of them I got so much trouble with was sophomore.

22:38.026 --> 22:49.618
At that time they had a deal that a freshman couldn't have dessert, which was known as kush, as may have come up to it before.

22:49.638 --> 22:59.228
And being a waiter, unless they kept a sophomore over there and watched them see what I was doing after I finished serving,

22:59.950 --> 23:06.636
They correctly suspected that I was eating cush, because I certainly was.

23:07.597 --> 23:15.685
And that's why they'd had their special sessions with me, just in case that they'd overlooked anything.

23:15.705 --> 23:23.692
So, they were fairly correct in their surmise that I did need special attention.

23:23.713 --> 23:29.518
Alright, so would you get over there early, work, could you go back to the dorm before your 8 o'clock class?

23:29.903 --> 23:35.573
I'd hit the dorm, grab the books and run to the 8 o'clock place.

23:35.633 --> 23:41.503
Incidentally, getting back to, they asked how we got registered on, it was a riot.

23:42.845 --> 23:54.966
They had sections, you know, and they decided what you wanted to do and then you had to go from one place to another to sign up.

23:55.469 --> 24:00.456
half the time when you got there the section that you had chosen to fill in your schedule was full.

24:01.537 --> 24:08.686
So then you had to revise your schedule and go chasing around until you found the section that wasn't full.

24:08.907 --> 24:17.478
And it was really a dogfight to get the classes you wanted at the time you wanted.

24:17.498 --> 24:25.088
Of course everyone wanted the Monday, Wednesday and Friday classes and finally

24:25.456 --> 24:28.940
is the Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday classes that were left.

24:28.960 --> 24:36.208
And if you didn't get your schedule just right and get there in a hurry, you'd end up with some Saturday classes.

24:36.228 --> 24:38.591
Nobody wanted Saturday morning classes.

24:38.611 --> 24:41.955
But a lot of us got them.

24:41.975 --> 24:50.124
By the time I was sophomore year, I got sworn enough to get them under Tuesday, Monday, Monday, Friday.

24:50.144 --> 24:52.927
For the freshmen, I had a bunch of Saturday classes.

24:52.947 --> 24:53.708
Now, of course,

24:55.173 --> 24:58.398
kids can pre-register electronically.

24:58.418 --> 25:12.658
And I'd say it's a damn good thing because 40,000 students against the full 5,000 that we had, our system would actually disintegrate in total confusion.

25:12.678 --> 25:15.562
Alright, in this routine you go to class.

25:15.682 --> 25:19.648
What did you do if you didn't have a class say at 10 o'clock?

25:19.688 --> 25:22.632
What did you do with that off hour?

25:23.405 --> 25:27.712
According to sophomore, you're supposed to come back and be available for details.

25:27.752 --> 25:38.329
According to the way we did it, we went to the library or went to some other freshman's room where they went to Washington.

25:38.349 --> 25:43.757
But we avoided getting back to the dormitory.

25:43.797 --> 25:46.822
Then I'd go to Maslow Street class.

25:47.463 --> 25:50.728
Then after lunch, I'd go to another class store.

25:51.282 --> 25:55.308
And when you didn't have classes in the afternoon, what did you do with your afternoons?

25:58.172 --> 26:11.010
Run details for the upperclassmen or on certain rare occasions, slip off somewhere and take a nap.

26:11.030 --> 26:13.433
Where would you take that nap?

26:13.454 --> 26:18.741
Well, I had a good deal with it.

26:21.067 --> 26:39.088
She was a person who was not in the military and lived off campus.

26:39.108 --> 26:50.601
A friend of mine from my hometown that lived in a little house on this side of the tracks across the

26:50.986 --> 26:59.334
from east or west of Northgate.

26:59.874 --> 27:09.243
It was about three or four hundred yards from my own trip.

27:09.263 --> 27:20.453
And I'd go down to Northgate, go about a quarter mile to Water Bryan, and work my way back up along the railroad track to come into the back part of this.

27:21.884 --> 27:24.407
go take a nap.

27:24.427 --> 27:31.035
That's another thing that they were probably right about by giving them special attention.

27:31.055 --> 27:32.918
Eating cushions, taking naps.

27:33.538 --> 27:35.501
Both very, very bad deals.

27:36.322 --> 27:42.209
The routine of the military drills, when did those occur and where?

27:43.370 --> 27:51.300
Well, we had military science classes and a lot of that occurred during that time.

27:51.989 --> 28:03.664
Also, the sophomores were charged with training the freshmen.

28:03.685 --> 28:19.546
And a lot of that occurred just before the formations, particularly the evening formations that had freshmen out there.

28:19.566 --> 28:19.946
See, I missed that.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.388
Another sin that I was duly castigated for.

28:22.398 --> 28:34.434
And, uh, I think, uh, because of the best of my drills, I never did really, uh, learn to drill well and cadence.

28:34.454 --> 28:43.265
The fact is, uh, Colonel Edcock, and he told me that I was selected to, uh, uh, command the regiment.

28:43.286 --> 28:52.017
I don't want a consideration whether he figured if I was out front by myself, nobody would notice that I was out of step.

28:53.330 --> 29:03.846
We had a long lanky sophomore that had our squad.

29:03.866 --> 29:13.100
At that time we had squires and platoons and squires right, squires left and not the Army drill.

29:13.120 --> 29:16.806
The new Army drill came in during the time of the student.

29:17.613 --> 29:33.591
I was not the most skilled freshman, believe me.

29:33.651 --> 29:44.683
But we suffered through that.

29:45.440 --> 29:50.044
You ate, you went back to your room.

29:51.946 --> 29:53.808
Freshmen, you studied.

29:53.948 --> 30:00.695
If you weren't studying, you'd better be sitting in the desk for the book in front of you.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.396
Freshmen are always tired.

30:02.416 --> 30:04.198
They're always sleeping.

30:05.019 --> 30:12.146
And so one of the great sins was to be caught up to death with the head down on your own sleep.

30:12.166 --> 30:13.607
That usually ends up with

30:17.789 --> 30:24.937
Let's say, in your outfit, who were some special friends that you made?

30:24.957 --> 30:27.420
Well, I still have friends in my outfit.

30:27.560 --> 30:34.908
My roommates, Bryce Allen, who lives out in West Texas, not too far from me.

30:34.928 --> 30:35.129
I love it.

30:35.149 --> 30:38.012
And who I say occasionally.

30:38.032 --> 30:42.437
And another one of my very special friends is down near Hollister.

30:42.457 --> 30:46.041
And they...

30:46.578 --> 30:56.931
Any of the ones in your freshman year, I think, whenever you see them in the freshman year, those two of us have a more timely sense in high school.

30:56.951 --> 31:00.195
All right, describe some of the, you mentioned some of the athletes.

31:00.215 --> 31:12.891
Who were the notable students on the campus then?

31:13.032 --> 31:14.914
Was John Kimbrough a noticeable

31:15.130 --> 31:25.495
Did everybody know who he was?
