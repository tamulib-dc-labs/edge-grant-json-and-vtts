WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:06.080
...working, hoping that the battery is still up. 
Let's see, and today is the 11th of June, Thursday,

00:14.920 --> 00:19.600
and I have the pleasure of being at Cala Vista and 
talking to Les Appelt, one of the most generous,

00:20.440 --> 00:24.040
thoughtful Aggies of all time. Les, why did you 
attend A&M in the first place? Why there? There

00:29.950 --> 00:32.497
were probably two reasons. My brother had 
attended A&M, a very devoted Aggie. He was several

00:42.180 --> 00:51.070
years ahead of me, and the other was probably 
largely economic.

00:55.250 --> 01:01.170
It was probably the least costly major college to 
attend. My economics in my first two years at A&M

01:01.570 --> 01:13.880
were covered by the savings I had,

01:17.930 --> 01:24.230
college for two years, at Hollisville.

01:28.220 --> 01:35.610
Skills I had with a, which was simply a fast-moving 
A&M machine,

01:44.160 --> 01:52.290
I managed to save the

01:44.160 --> 01:52.290
beneficent sum of about six or seven hundred 
dollars in two years. Now

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
you

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
entered

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
as

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
a freshman

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
in the

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
fall

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
of, fall

01:52.930 --> 03:19.750
of 36.

03:27.720 --> 03:31.940
You had visited the campus a number of times before 
enrolling. Several times. When you went to

03:35.313 --> 03:38.588
enroll, how did you get there? On the train? The 
bus? No, I left my folks in the back

03:41.160 --> 03:53.860
seat. Yeah, now what were the, what did you take 
with you, in terms of clothing and supplies? You

03:58.700 --> 04:30.460
see at that time, uniforms were, it

03:58.700 --> 04:30.460
was so

03:58.700 --> 04:30.460
inconsequential

03:58.700 --> 04:30.460
that I don't remember what it is. Describe if you 
can how you were received. How did you get in a

04:34.675 --> 04:39.860
dormitory, get in a unit, get enrolled? I

04:39.840 --> 04:52.000
remember not really too good on that, except that, 
the dormitory assignment had been made, and I knew

04:51.980 --> 05:10.540
where to go

04:51.980 --> 05:10.540
by the sophomores. The leader began giving us 
instructions in campusology,

05:10.520 --> 05:24.660
and we'd do anything right. The

05:24.640 --> 05:34.680
fact that I had this job at MSL caused some 
confusion among our sophomores. We

05:34.660 --> 06:01.520
were, luckily, we were

05:34.660 --> 06:01.520
in a hall dormitory, which was fortunate for me to 
just directly cross the street of those recent

05:34.660 --> 06:01.520
halls. The fact that I had to go to MSL exempted me 
from marching in with the outfit, which annoyed

06:01.840 --> 06:14.850
the sophomores going in. So, it turned out that 
about once a month,

06:14.830 --> 06:24.300
they would have a special session. At

06:24.280 --> 06:30.780
that time, it would come to known as ass tears. My 
transgressions didn't, so we were fortunate

06:30.760 --> 06:42.480
enough to have a job at MSL, to

06:42.460 --> 06:58.620
show you how far the university progressed, where 
it reserved

06:42.460 --> 06:58.620
for football.

07:02.760 --> 07:13.090
We had John Kimbrough, Ralph, and all the freshmen 
back then, all the football players. I

07:13.070 --> 07:33.010
think they stayed in there, my freshman, 
sophomore year, as soon

07:13.070 --> 07:33.010
as we could

07:13.070 --> 07:33.010
now have.

07:32.990 --> 07:39.010
Can you describe a typical dormitory room at that 
time? How was it furnished? How big was it? What did

07:41.657 --> 07:43.010
y'all have in it? Well, typical there was,

07:42.990 --> 08:03.080
there'd

07:42.990 --> 08:03.080
be two rooms, so it was just basically a shop. The 
floors

08:03.060 --> 08:22.040
were

08:03.060 --> 08:22.040
plastered

08:03.060 --> 08:22.040
and painted. There

08:22.020 --> 08:33.720
was

08:22.020 --> 08:33.720
bunk beds. The size of the room, I'd say, there was 
room for rainbows. I'd say we could have two desks.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.920
I'd say the room was about to have ten, about 
twelve. So, no rug, no curtains? Not a rug. We

08:48.963 --> 08:50.520
brought in anything like that. We got to do that 
ourselves. Usually, we had to, somehow or

08:53.940 --> 09:00.780
another, we always had to throw up something. So, 
we'd hit the deck with more beds. We wouldn't be in

09:02.760 --> 09:03.781
that cold floor. Describe the campus physically 
when you arrived. What was there? There

09:10.820 --> 09:28.120
was quite a bit of space

09:10.820 --> 09:28.120
between what was the main door. The library was 
there. Between

09:30.100 --> 09:38.700
the library and that main building. Across the 
street from us, now the ladies'

09:38.680 --> 09:50.370
dormitory. The

09:50.350 --> 09:59.610
building that was used in the

09:50.350 --> 09:59.610
Amble Hill group department. Possibly for study 
or demonstration. Uh, it had, uh, some lots there.

10:06.590 --> 10:08.610
And they stored hay in it. And they had mangers 
there where they feed the animals. I remember that

10:13.590 --> 10:18.620
very, very, very, because shortly after all

10:18.600 --> 10:24.950
the freshmen came in, and I think maybe a day or two 
before actual school started, they aired all the

10:28.930 --> 10:32.770
freshmen out. Describe airing out the freshmen. 
Airing out the freshmen was just, well,

10:36.750 --> 10:45.670
they just literally chased you out. They used

10:45.650 --> 10:55.040
softballs there to keep you from coming back in. 
And then, uh, all the softballs all over the campus

10:59.020 --> 11:03.120
started hunting down the freshmen. And

11:03.100 --> 11:07.570
they caught most of them. Long

11:07.550 --> 11:23.380
sessions with them.

11:23.360 --> 12:46.000
Those

11:23.360 --> 12:46.000
big

11:23.360 --> 12:46.000
open

11:23.360 --> 12:46.000
areas

11:23.360 --> 12:46.000
on

11:23.360 --> 12:46.000
the

11:23.360 --> 12:46.000
east

11:23.360 --> 12:46.000
side of

11:23.360 --> 12:46.000
the

11:23.360 --> 12:46.000
campus

12:45.980 --> 12:50.000
that now are the golf course and the bonfire area. 
What were those used for? Drill fields. Were those

12:50.980 --> 12:53.000
used for drill fields then? Well, not so much were 
used. The

12:53.980 --> 13:35.890
engineers

12:53.980 --> 13:35.890
used

12:53.980 --> 13:35.890
them. They

13:35.870 --> 14:03.510
used

13:35.870 --> 14:03.510
them

13:35.870 --> 14:03.510
for

13:35.870 --> 14:03.510
engineering.

14:03.490 --> 14:09.740
But that area was reserved for military 
instruction. How were freshmen treated in

14:09.720 --> 14:16.100
general?

14:16.080 --> 14:31.600
The

14:16.080 --> 14:31.600
juniors and seniors sought to, the sophomores 
treated the freshmen with bomb leaves. Excerpt,

14:35.600 --> 14:53.010
a predominant attitude was wiped out. I don't know 
of any freshmen that ever went through that area

14:58.160 --> 15:01.360
that didn't, uh, accept an inferior position.

15:09.130 --> 15:12.620
I think they gave all of us a little insight into 
negative psychology. It's, you can't get over it.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.620
How often was a board used? Not near as often as...

15:29.140 --> 15:33.160
And, uh, it was a fair-sized piece of wood. Did

15:33.140 --> 15:43.360
you, did you ever get hit by a board when you hadn't 
done anything? Oh, absolutely. Normally, how

15:48.128 --> 15:49.360
many licks would there be? The

15:49.340 --> 16:06.100
worst experience I

15:49.340 --> 16:06.100
had was the board

16:06.080 --> 16:07.101
in my junior year. There was a tradition that, uh, 
sergeant

16:10.030 --> 16:18.520
stripes caught stripes or whatever. I was made a 
tech sergeant, which was five stripes. And

16:27.320 --> 16:36.590
then three days later, I was promoted to master 
sergeant.

16:41.220 --> 16:49.670
My contention was that

16:41.220 --> 16:49.670
the juniors and seniors had, I mean, the seniors 
had, the seniors did this. The seniors had

16:53.370 --> 17:18.100
balls.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.101
Fifth year senior, I mean, can't, obviously,

17:19.080 --> 17:46.210
because

17:19.080 --> 17:46.210
I

17:19.080 --> 17:46.210
guess he knew

17:19.080 --> 17:46.210
how

17:19.080 --> 17:46.210
to test it. He knew how to test it. He made

17:47.190 --> 17:54.580
a fatal error. Blood

17:54.560 --> 18:43.480
came in

17:54.560 --> 18:43.480
through

17:54.560 --> 18:43.480
his...

18:43.460 --> 18:50.110
Oh, how satisfied I was about that whole

18:43.460 --> 18:50.110
thing. In the, uh, in, now, your outfit was E? Uh, it 
was, uh, E, engineers. Now, the, I wasn't sure

18:57.626 --> 19:07.750
about,

19:07.730 --> 19:09.750
about the mess hall job, but I registered late, and 
they informed me of a new company. Instead of being

19:15.630 --> 19:17.770
Walton Hall, that company was in PG Hall, which is 
an old wood building adjacent to it. That was

19:24.060 --> 19:36.400
really

19:24.060 --> 19:36.400
a,

19:36.380 --> 19:38.400
really a heartbreaker for me. I didn't want to take 
it out of the company, but it was just one of those

19:44.340 --> 19:46.240
things that happened, and I couldn't do anything 
about it. Uh, but it turned out that, uh, F Company

19:50.220 --> 19:54.710
had got some pretty good juniors and seniors. Uh, 
unusually good bunches. Uh, we had a strong bunch

20:01.900 --> 20:03.920
of sophomores. And, uh, so by the time I was a 
senior, F Company

20:08.540 --> 20:19.440
was back up

20:08.540 --> 20:19.440
in, I had been selected as, uh, the deputy 
lieutenant colonel in the engineer regiment.

20:25.120 --> 20:31.960
This

20:25.120 --> 20:31.960
company had high morale. We won the intramural 
championship my senior year. And by that time, I

20:38.750 --> 20:39.771
was glad that, uh, I'd been a year at PG Hall, and, 
and got an F company. What did PG stand for? You're

20:47.960 --> 20:53.200
saying the initials, P... That's, that's good. 
That's, that's a good one. I don't remember. Okay,

20:56.400 --> 20:57.176
alright. I haven't heard that. Did, did your 
outfits have nicknames? E and F? No, not really.

21:03.580 --> 21:04.601
Like I've heard of Spider D and things like that. 
Yeah, that's, uh... Alright. Were they both

21:07.396 --> 21:08.600
engineering companies? Yes. He was an engineer 
regiment. Six companies. Alright, now... Two

21:12.740 --> 21:13.761
battalions, three... Describe,

21:13.740 --> 21:17.500
uh, the routine of a typical Monday through Friday 
day. Got up at what time, did what when. Take me

21:20.480 --> 21:21.501
through the whole day. Eat. You had a job, and... I 
had a special session with me. Alright, so, would

21:24.480 --> 21:25.501
you, you'd get over there early, work, Yeah. Could

21:28.760 --> 22:08.490
you

21:28.760 --> 22:08.490
go

21:28.760 --> 22:08.490
back

21:28.760 --> 22:08.490
to

21:28.760 --> 22:08.490
the dorm?

22:08.470 --> 22:09.190
Yeah. And,

22:09.391 --> 23:09.810
uh,

23:09.790 --> 23:24.030
And, uh, And,

23:09.790 --> 23:24.030
uh,

23:24.010 --> 23:26.030
And, uh, And, uh, And, uh, Would you go back to the 
dorm before your eight o'clock class? Yeah. I'd,

23:30.012 --> 23:49.040
I'd hit

23:30.012 --> 23:49.040
the dorm,

23:49.020 --> 23:50.041
decide what you wanted to do, and then you had to go 
from one place to another to sign up. And about half

23:53.170 --> 23:54.191
the time when you got there, the section that you 
had chosen to fill in your schedule was full. So

23:58.129 --> 23:59.190
then you had to revise your schedule, go chasing 
around until you found the section wasn't full.

24:03.719 --> 24:05.200
Uh, it, it, uh, was in Friday, uh, classes, 
Thursday and Saturday classes that were left,

24:21.900 --> 24:23.101
and if you, uh, didn't get your schedule just, 
just, just,

24:28.380 --> 24:31.570
just, uh, right and get there in a hurry, you'd end 
up with a lot of discussion. By the time my

24:40.730 --> 24:41.751
sophomore gets formed, the kids

24:41.730 --> 24:55.710
can pre-register. I'd say it's a damn good thing 
because with 40,000 students What? against the

25:04.840 --> 25:05.861
4,000 or 5,000 that we had, uh, our system would 
have to have disintegrated in total confusion.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.860
Alright, in this routine, you go to class, what did 
you do if you didn't have a class, say, at 10

25:18.840 --> 25:19.861
o'clock? What did you do with that off hour? Well, 
according to sophomore, you're

25:24.600 --> 25:42.260
supposed to

25:24.600 --> 25:42.260
come

25:24.600 --> 25:42.260
back and be available. Right, then you'd come 
back, right, then after lunch, and when you didn't

25:52.600 --> 25:53.621
have classes in the afternoon, what did you do with

25:55.600 --> 26:11.520
your

25:55.600 --> 26:11.520
afternoons?

26:11.500 --> 26:12.521
Where would you take

26:12.500 --> 26:41.640
that

26:12.500 --> 26:41.640
now?

26:41.620 --> 26:54.680
Well, this

26:41.620 --> 26:54.680
side of

26:41.620 --> 26:54.680
the tracks, uh, east,

26:59.530 --> 27:00.551
it wasn't about three,

27:00.530 --> 27:04.970
four hundred yards from my home, I drove down to 
Northgate about a quarter mile to Walter Bryan and

27:12.240 --> 27:13.261
worked my way back up along the railroad track to 
the other side of the border from this and, uh, and,

27:22.130 --> 27:25.000
uh, go take a nap. That's all, that's another thing 
that they were probably right about by giving me

27:31.190 --> 27:32.721
special attention. The eating cushions that went 
off to take naps was both very, very bad deals.

27:38.190 --> 27:38.741
Right. The routine of the military drills, when, 
when did those occur and where? Uh, we

27:46.940 --> 28:12.460
had,

27:46.940 --> 28:12.460
uh,

28:12.440 --> 28:13.461
a military science class and, uh, you see, I missed 
that. That was, uh, duly castigated and, uh, I do,

28:29.360 --> 28:31.380
uh, kind of missed the drill. I never did really, 
uh, learn to drill well and came to inspect this,

28:38.440 --> 28:41.950
uh, Colonel Adcock and I was selected to, uh, 
command the regiment. One of the considerations

28:48.530 --> 28:49.551
was we figured if I'd out front by myself we had a 
long like a,

28:55.780 --> 29:05.600
kind of, we had squads and platoons and squad 
right, squad left and not the, the armor drill. Uh,

29:12.060 --> 29:14.080
the, the armor drill came

29:15.060 --> 29:25.130
in,

29:15.060 --> 29:25.130
uh, during the time I

29:26.110 --> 29:33.240
was not the most skilled freshman

29:33.220 --> 29:36.730
to completely beat me out of being out of step. But,

29:37.710 --> 29:41.480
uh, we suffered through that. Uh, really then,

29:55.300 --> 29:57.320
then as, uh, you ate, you went back to your room, 
every now and then, freshmen were always tired.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.181
They were always, uh, sleeping. And so, one of the 
great sins was to be caught up to you after you, uh,

30:11.220 --> 30:12.481
head down on your own and

30:12.460 --> 30:17.737
sleep. That usually ended up with, uh... Let's 
see, in your outfit who

30:23.120 --> 30:40.320
were some

30:40.300 --> 30:46.920
special friends

30:40.300 --> 30:46.920
that you made? Oh,

30:46.900 --> 30:57.620
I still, uh, I was still, any, any of the ones that 
you had. Alright, describe some of the, some of the

31:04.600 --> 31:05.621
things on

31:05.600 --> 31:12.500
the campus then. John, was John Kimbrough a 
noticeable, did everybody know who he was? Oh,

31:17.480 --> 31:19.500
yeah, everybody knew.
