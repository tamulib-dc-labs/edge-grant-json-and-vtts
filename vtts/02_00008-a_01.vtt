WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:06.037
Hoping that the battery is still up. Let's see, and 
today is the 11th of June, Thursday, and I have the

00:08.500 --> 00:24.082
pleasure of being at Cala Vista and talking to Les 
Appelt, one of the most generous, thoughtful

00:08.500 --> 00:24.082
Aggies of all time. Les, why did you attend A&M in 
the first place? Why there? Probably two reasons.

00:32.591 --> 00:41.359
My brother had attended A&M and was a very devoted 
Aggie. He was several years ahead of me. And the

00:46.704 --> 00:51.088
other was probably largely economic. At that 
time, Texas A&M was probably the least costly

00:52.109 --> 01:01.257
major college to attend. My economics in my first 
two years at A&M were covered by the savings I made

01:01.945 --> 01:19.281
by staying out of college for two years. I worked in 
a law office in Hollisville, and then due to some

01:20.122 --> 01:31.513
skills I had with watching a computer, what they 
called at that time, which was simply a

01:32.135 --> 01:35.438
fast-moving air machine. I computed acreages for 
the AAA program and I managed to save the

01:37.820 --> 01:53.894
sum of about six or seven hundred dollars in two 
years working.

01:57.197 --> 02:00.960
Weldon, that's my brother, had done volunteer and 
with that connection I was one of the very few

02:01.514 --> 02:15.776
freshmen that were given a job as a mess hall 
waiter. That paid probably about twenty-five,

02:17.960 --> 02:27.775
twenty-six dollars a month. fee for room and board 
and laundry was about $29 if I remember it at that

02:28.160 --> 02:38.072
time. I don't recall just what I did in my freshman 
year, but I kept track of what I did my sophomore

02:38.092 --> 02:48.825
year and it cost me $350 to go to school in my 
sophomore year. That's all the cash that I spent.

02:51.688 --> 02:55.433
Plus the fact that my other dad would write him a 
letter every week and enclose a criss-cross bill

02:55.750 --> 03:04.622
in it, which cost him spending money. And really 
not even save money on that. Now you entered as a

03:08.968 --> 03:13.013
freshman in the fall of... I entered in the 
thirties. Fall of 36, I guess. Fall of 36. Class of

03:20.478 --> 03:23.180
37. Graduated in 41. So, okay. You had visited the 
campus a number of times before enrolling.

03:32.789 --> 03:33.449
Several times. When you went to enroll, how did you 
get there? On the train, the bus? No, my folks took

03:41.356 --> 03:46.581
me, I think at that time, a Dodge touring car and 
took me out there and loaded up all my few

03:47.185 --> 03:54.035
possessions in the back seat. Yeah, now what were 
the, what did you take with you in terms of clothing

03:54.055 --> 03:58.482
and supplies? You see at that time uniforms were 
furnished and so I took I suppose mostly underwear

03:58.522 --> 04:15.808
and maybe my toothbrush toilet items,

04:17.122 --> 04:21.929
and, uh, safe to reserve. You know, we traveled 
pretty light. In fact, it was so inconsequential

04:27.076 --> 04:30.241
that I don't remember what it is. Describe, if you 
can, how you were received. How did you get in a

04:34.687 --> 04:39.614
dormitory, get in a unit, get enrolled? Well, uh,

04:48.560 --> 05:01.719
Memory's not really too good on that except that

04:48.560 --> 05:01.719
the dormitory assignment had been made and I knew 
where to go and where to unload. And of course the

05:02.880 --> 05:16.660
freshmen were greeted by the sophomores who later 
began giving us instructions in campusology. And

05:17.332 --> 05:24.367
there for a number of days, of course, there's no 
way a freshman would do anything right. The fact

05:26.191 --> 05:36.994
that I had this job as a vessel caused some 
confusion among our sophomores.

05:37.379 --> 06:03.366
which was Company E. And we were, luckily, we were 
in the

05:37.379 --> 06:03.366
brand new Baldwin Hall Dormitory, which was, 
fortunately for me, just directly across the

05:37.379 --> 06:03.366
street from those recent halls. The fact that I had 
But that exempted me from marching in with the

06:06.623 --> 06:15.693
outfit, which annoyed the sophomores more than. 
So it turned out that about once a month, they would

06:15.713 --> 06:27.186
have a special session for me. And at that time, we 
would come to known as ass tears. So they'd all sit

06:32.873 --> 06:34.875
around. reminded me of all my transgressions by 
having been so fortunate enough to

06:36.053 --> 06:47.064
have a job in Nassau. And to show you how far the 
university progressed, the first two ramps in

06:47.084 --> 07:01.299
Walton Hall, A and B, were reserved for football 
teams. And that was in the years when we had John

07:01.319 --> 07:05.824
Kimbrough, Ralph So

07:06.513 --> 07:14.902
we got, all the freshmen got to know a lot of 
football players real good. And I think they

07:15.863 --> 07:29.479
stayed in there my freshman, sophomore year, and 
then I think they got some

07:15.863 --> 07:29.479
other facilities as well. But there was a whole lot 
different from the facilities we now have for our

07:29.499 --> 07:33.363
athletes. Can you describe a typical dormitory 
room at that time. How was it furnished? How big was

07:40.046 --> 07:40.987
it? What did y'all have in it? Typical there was the 
two rooms with a shower and a bath. The lavatory was

07:55.570 --> 07:59.657
in the room. So it was just basically the shower. 
The floors were concrete.

08:15.375 --> 08:18.982
It had a special texture on it. The room wall was 
just

08:19.002 --> 08:29.500
plastered and painted and there was a double bunk 
beds in each room. So each room had two people.

08:33.757 --> 08:38.907
size of the room and I'd say there was room for 
rainbows. I said we could have two desks and I'd say

08:38.927 --> 08:45.320
the room was about 10, about 12. So no rug, no 
curtains? Not really. We brought in anything like

08:48.808 --> 08:51.192
that. We let them do that ourselves. Usually we had 
a Describe

08:55.829 --> 09:09.412
the campus physically when you arrived. What was 
there?

09:16.248 --> 09:16.929
It felt like this. There was quite a bit of space 
between what's now known as the Jack Wayne's

09:16.949 --> 09:28.201
building and the old main building. The library 
was there.

09:34.288 --> 09:45.580
They had a true library in that main building 
across the street from what's now the ladies'

09:34.288 --> 09:45.580
dormitory.

09:50.167 --> 09:59.657
was a building that was used in the animal 
husbandry department.

09:59.677 --> 10:01.980
Possibly for study and demonstration. It had some 
lots there and they stored hay in it and they had

10:02.801 --> 10:14.554
mangers there where they feed these animals. I 
remember that very, very, very well because

10:19.462 --> 10:33.122
Shortly after all

10:19.462 --> 10:33.122
the freshmen came in, I think maybe a day or two 
before actually school started, they aired all

10:19.462 --> 10:33.122
the freshmen out. Describe airing out the 
freshmen. Airing out the freshmen was just

10:35.084 --> 10:43.917
telling them Well, they just literally chased you 
out of your room and posted sophomores there to

10:44.352 --> 10:54.425
keep you from coming back in. And then all the 
sophomores, all the campers started hunting down

10:54.445 --> 11:03.617
the

10:54.445 --> 11:03.617
freshmen.

11:07.141 --> 11:08.042
And they caught most of them. And they had long 
sessions with them. usually with the freshman

11:15.065 --> 11:42.060
ending up being accused of being uncooperative or 
sassy or whatever in order to be assessed the

11:15.065 --> 11:42.060
punishments all the way from using the board on 
them to push-ups and miscellaneous other

11:15.065 --> 11:42.060
indignities.

11:43.181 --> 11:43.722
I had I noticed this building I was picking up that 
Adam Huckabee had. So when they aired me out, I took

11:50.275 --> 11:56.723
a certain Kutcher's Roof and beat it down there at 
high speed. I spent the night in one of the manors

11:57.724 --> 12:06.456
with a nice soft hay cushion under me. And 
actually, even though all the Huckabee's were

12:06.476 --> 12:13.405
around, I actually fell asleep. The sophomore did 
come through there, but I pulled a bunch of hay over

12:14.178 --> 12:21.608
me. And I survived that night very well. I still 
remember that building. But right now, I think the

12:25.813 --> 12:42.075
building is probably the Teague building was on 
top of that site. those big open areas on the east

12:42.663 --> 12:52.994
side of the campus that now are the golf course and 
the bonfire area, what were those used for drill

12:42.663 --> 12:52.994
fields then? Well, not so much were used. The drill 
field that was used most was the one between the

12:54.296 --> 13:02.144
library and the Jack Williams Library. That was 
used drill field there. And that would have been

13:04.467 --> 13:10.493
just over to the north of the where these animal 
husbandry small buildings were. The area where

13:17.315 --> 13:35.021
the golf course is and on both sides of the road 
leading into the main building were used for

13:17.315 --> 13:35.021
various sundry military science projects. The 
engineers used them largely in mapping. We'd do

13:39.110 --> 13:40.772
plane table mapping. We'd

13:40.872 --> 14:03.415
do lots of engineering

13:40.872 --> 14:03.415
activities, demonstrations on bridge

13:40.872 --> 14:03.415
building

13:40.872 --> 14:03.415
and road building and also on beam missions. But 
that area was reserved for military instruction.

14:08.928 --> 14:12.854
How were freshmen treated in general?

14:15.518 --> 14:35.610
Well, the junior seniors treated freshmen quite 
well, but they

14:15.518 --> 14:35.610
can't have their hands washed because they saw to 
it that sophomores treated freshmen with bomb

14:15.518 --> 14:35.610
leaves.

14:36.957 --> 14:54.395
And any

14:36.957 --> 14:54.395
effort whatsoever for a freshman to exert a 
predominant attitude was wiped out. I don't know

14:54.796 --> 15:03.825
any freshman that ever went through that area that 
didn't accept an inferior position.

15:09.290 --> 15:15.437
I think gave all of us a little insight into 
negative psychology. And you can't get over it.

15:18.441 --> 15:19.782
How often was a board used? Not near as often as 
recruited, but there was no really restriction.

15:29.834 --> 15:33.077
And it was a fair sized piece of wood. Yeah. Some of 
them were shaved down baseball bats. Did you ever

15:40.238 --> 15:44.984
get hit by a board when you hadn't done anything? 
Oh, absolutely. Normally, how many licks would

15:48.108 --> 15:49.811
there be? Well, usually maybe an order of three to 
five.

15:58.382 --> 16:00.084
And that connection brings up another thing. The 
worst experience I had with the board was in my

16:00.725 --> 16:07.113
junior year. There was a tradition that when you 
got promoted and you got sergeant stripes,

16:12.183 --> 16:22.437
corporal stripes, whatever you got, that they 
tacked those on. I was made a tech sergeant which

16:23.858 --> 16:40.941
was five stripes and

16:23.858 --> 16:40.941
they put those on and then three days later I was 
promoted to master sergeant.

16:41.461 --> 16:48.569
My contention was that they could put one more 
stripe on. The juniors and seniors had, I mean the

16:48.589 --> 16:52.754
seniors had, the seniors did this. The seniors, in 
all their wisdom, said, no, we have to knock the

16:53.475 --> 16:58.521
five off. And then put the six on. So then, about 
three or four days, you add all that up, we had 16

17:03.427 --> 17:10.455
licks from each of the seniors. Most of them were 
pretty moderate teps, but there was a fifth-year

17:11.532 --> 17:25.485
senior named Ken Jalowski that was, if you please, 
a real chicken kid. In fact, he was the one who

17:27.307 --> 17:36.376
finally found him guilty of stealing some 
yearbooks at the end of the semester and I think he

17:27.307 --> 17:36.376
cleared him out. But anyway, he... It didn't 
really take to me. There was an obvious reason,

17:44.541 --> 17:50.988
because I guess he knew I detested him. But at any 
rate, he made a fatal error. He hit me low. And as you

17:57.134 --> 18:04.162
know, I'm a pretty good sized guy. And he was one of 
the shaved down baseball guys. And so I culled it

18:11.371 --> 18:16.396
and they pulled my pants down and the shirt off. I 
had stripes across my legs that missed the

18:17.017 --> 18:22.182
buttocks. And so he had to permit me to pop in one. To 
make a short story short, I damn near drove him down

18:30.770 --> 18:36.977
his hall. And blood came in through his pants. I 
still recall how satisfied I was about that whole

18:41.138 --> 18:46.566
deal. These are the little things that would 
occur. Now your outfit was E? It was E-Engineers.

18:56.880 --> 18:57.621
E-Engineers. Now, I wasn't sure that I was going to 
come back the second year for the finances. There

19:06.854 --> 19:09.778
was some doubt about the mess hall job. I don't 
recall all the details, but I registered late, and

19:09.927 --> 19:25.945
they informed me of a new company, and instead of 
being Walton Hall, that company was in BG Hall,

19:09.927 --> 19:25.945
which was an old wood building adjacent to Walton 
Hall. Down there was the Beauty Bell building. And

19:30.590 --> 19:39.580
so we, uh, F Company, that was really a, really a 
heartbreaker for me at the time. to take it out of

19:40.268 --> 19:43.433
the company. It was just one of those things that 
happened and I couldn't do anything about it. But

19:49.462 --> 19:58.855
it turned out that F Company had got some pretty 
good juniors and seniors at that time. And

19:59.456 --> 20:01.359
unusually good bunches. We had a strong bunch of 
sophomores. So by the time I was a senior, F Company

20:06.728 --> 20:15.096
was back up in

20:06.728 --> 20:15.096
the corner, ramp, closest to the mess hall. And

20:16.357 --> 20:26.407
I had been selected as, it happened to be 
Lieutenant Colonel of the Commanding Engineer

20:16.357 --> 20:26.407
Regiment. So, F Company, really it was a company of 
high morale. We won the intramural championship

20:32.533 --> 20:35.976
my senior year. What

20:36.378 --> 20:47.413
did PG stand for?

20:51.739 --> 20:52.740
You're saying the initials. That's a good one. I 
haven't heard that. Did your outfits have

20:58.749 --> 21:00.471
nicknames? E and F? No, not really. Like I've heard 
of Spider D and Were they both engineering

21:05.639 --> 21:09.023
companies? Yes, he was an engineer regiment. Six 
companies. Two battalions, three companies

21:13.468 --> 21:17.573
each. Describe the routine of a typical Monday 
through Friday day. Got up at what time, did what

21:24.702 --> 21:26.504
when. Take me through the whole day. I'm not real 
sure about the exact times, but there's Getting up

21:34.057 --> 21:36.099
pretty damn early. I'd say we'd be riding out 
somewhere around 6.30 or 7.00. And of course I'd

21:42.627 --> 21:44.129
head over to the mess hall. The units would form up 
in the street and march in. I think the march in was

21:49.074 --> 21:56.343
probably somewhere between 7.00 to 7.14, 
probably. Maybe 7.30. The classes started at

21:58.606 --> 22:00.688
8.00. Probably about 7 or 15. Eating didn't take a 
long time. How did you eat? You had a job and...

22:08.305 --> 22:14.616
Well, I ate in a hell of a hurry. And I still have a bad 
habit. I had a certain table and my normal meal time

22:19.004 --> 22:24.955
was less than five minutes. We'd finish and then 
we'd gulp the food down. One of the advantages of

22:32.351 --> 22:38.018
being in the mess hall, one of them I got so much 
trouble with, was the sophomore ward. At that

22:38.038 --> 22:46.588
time, they had a deal that freshmen couldn't have 
dessert, which was known as kush. This may have

22:47.268 --> 22:49.631
come up here before. And being a waiter, see, 
unless they I kept a soft mold and watched them see

22:54.466 --> 23:00.354
what I was doing after I finished surgery. They 
correctly suspected that I was eating kush,

23:01.115 --> 23:06.642
because I certainly was. And that's why they'd 
have their special sessions with me, just in case

23:07.624 --> 23:18.178
that they overlooked

23:07.624 --> 23:18.178
anything. fairly correct in their surmises that I 
did need special attention. Alright, so would you

23:23.706 --> 23:29.354
get over there early, work, would you go back to the 
dorm before your eight o'clock class? Yeah, I'd

23:29.374 --> 23:34.421
hit the dorm, grab my books and run to eight o'clock 
class. Incidentally, getting back to the aspect

23:35.523 --> 23:42.853
of how we got registered on, it was a riot. They had 
sections, you know, and they decide what you

23:49.175 --> 23:53.959
wanted to do, and then you had to go from one place to 
another to sign up. And about half the time you got

23:54.620 --> 24:00.485
there, the section that you had chosen to fill in 
your schedule was full. So then you had to revise

24:01.566 --> 24:06.630
your schedule and go chasing around until you 
found the section wasn't full. And it was really a

24:07.691 --> 24:17.439
dogfight to get the classes you wanted at the time 
you wanted. Of course, everyone one of the Monday,

24:18.689 --> 24:36.247
Wednesday, and Friday classes, and finally is the 
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday classes that

24:18.689 --> 24:36.247
were left and if you didn't get your schedule just 
right and get there in a hurry, you'd end up with

24:18.689 --> 24:36.247
some Saturday classes. Nobody wants Saturday 
morning classes. But a lot of us got, by the time my

24:38.570 --> 24:42.874
sophomore year was formed, get the money to teach 
them, the money they need to provide. But

24:50.006 --> 24:51.207
freshman, I had a bunch of Saturday classes. Now, 
of course, kids can pre-register

24:52.949 --> 24:58.416
electronically. And I'd say it's a damn good thing 
because with 40,000 students against the 4,000 or

24:58.436 --> 25:12.372
5,000 that we had, our system would actually have 
disintegrated, total confusion. All right, in

25:12.588 --> 25:15.572
this routine, you go to class. What did you do if you 
didn't have a class, say, at 10 o'clock? What did

25:19.698 --> 25:21.921
you do with that off hour? Well, according to 
sophomore, you're supposed to come back and be

25:22.261 --> 25:27.809
available for details. According to the way we did 
it, we went to the library or went to some other

25:27.829 --> 25:37.822
freshman's room where they went to Washington. 
But we avoided getting back to the dormitory. All

25:41.888 --> 25:42.088
right. You'd come back. Then I'd go to Vessel 
Street and got a class. Right. Then after lunch.

25:49.458 --> 25:51.560
Brought another class door. And when you didn't 
have classes in the afternoon, what did you do with

25:51.580 --> 25:55.323
your afternoons?

25:58.206 --> 26:11.037
Run details

25:58.206 --> 26:11.037
by the upperclassmen or on certain rare occasions 
slip off somewhere and take a nap. Where would you?

26:12.207 --> 26:13.108
Take that now. Well, I had a

26:13.429 --> 26:26.027
good deal going on. I had a day voucher. She was a 
person that was not in the military and lived

26:28.510 --> 26:39.125
off campus. A friend of mine from my hometown that 
lived in a little house The side of

26:41.637 --> 27:04.364
the

26:41.637 --> 27:04.364
tracks across the east or west of Northgate, it 
runs about three or four hundred yards from

26:41.637 --> 27:04.364
that on-trip. And I'd go down to Northgate and go 
about a quarter mile to Waterbriar. and work my way

27:10.797 --> 27:24.474
back up along the railroad track, coming to the 
back part of this, and go

27:10.797 --> 27:24.474
take a nap. That's another thing that they were 
probably right about by giving me special

27:24.494 --> 27:31.023
attention. Eating cushions, sitting up, taking 
naps. Both very, very bad deals. The routine of the

27:36.590 --> 27:39.994
military drills, when When did those occur and 
where? Well, we had military science classes and a

27:43.343 --> 27:52.154
lot of that occurred during that time. Also, the 
sophomores were charged with training the

27:52.174 --> 28:07.534
freshmen and a lot of that would occur just before 
formations, particularly

28:07.953 --> 28:15.403
the evening formations that had freshmen out 
there driving them on. See, I missed that. That was

28:16.524 --> 28:26.117
a sin that I was duly castigated for. And I do kind of 
miss the new drill. I never did really learn to

28:29.662 --> 28:32.445
drill well. The head inspector is Colonel Adcock, 
and he told me that I'd been selected to command the

28:37.147 --> 28:53.413
regiment, doing one consideration where they 
figured if I'd out front by myself, nobody would

28:37.147 --> 28:53.413
notice that I'd out of

28:37.147 --> 28:53.413
step. We had a long lanky sophomore that had asked 
why. At that time, we had squads and platoons, and

29:03.370 --> 29:12.484
squad right, squad left, and not the Army drill. 
The Army drill came in during the time of the

29:12.504 --> 29:18.974
student. And the freshman sophomore year, the 
squad left, squad right, you know. And I was not the

29:24.422 --> 29:27.927
most skilled freshman, I believe. But

29:29.392 --> 29:38.323
we suffered through that. And really, then is what 
the, you know, you ate, you went back to your room,

29:40.926 --> 29:50.157
the freshman year, you studied. And these, you 
didn't see this coming out of my eyes, making sure

29:51.619 --> 29:55.784
you studied. If you weren't studying, you'd 
rather be sitting in your desk and looking for it.

30:00.188 --> 30:02.251
Every now and then, freshmen are always tired. 
They're always sleeping. And so one of the great

30:04.934 --> 30:12.204
sins would be caught up to you after you head down on 
your own and sleep. That usually ends up with

30:12.224 --> 30:17.832
appropriate punishment. Let's see. In your 
outfit, who were some special friends that you

30:18.253 --> 30:21.597
made? Well, I still have friends in my outfit. Lou 
Bates, Bryce Allen. was

30:29.652 --> 30:50.096
out

30:29.652 --> 30:50.096
in West Texas, not too far from Loveland. And what I 
say occasionally. And another one of my very

30:50.696 --> 30:52.378
special friends is down near Hollisville, Leroy 
Johnston. And any of the ones that you're fresh

30:52.398 --> 30:54.401
with me after, whenever you see them, they're 
special friends. Those two I spent more time with

30:54.421 --> 30:55.542
since then than I have. Describe some of the, you 
mentioned some of the athletes. Who were the

31:00.224 --> 31:05.792
notable student, students on the campus then?

31:13.043 --> 31:17.130
Was John Kimbrough a noticeable, did everybody 
know who he was? Oh yeah,

31:17.250 --> 31:24.321
everybody knew who Kimbrough was. I don't, I got, I 
don't think, I don't know.
