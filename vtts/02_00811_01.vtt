00:06.410 --> 00:26.137
I am Deborah Parks interviewing Mr. Herschel 
Burgess for the History of College Station

00:06.410 --> 00:26.137
Project at the Community Savings and Loan Branch 
Office on March 16, 1983, 3 PM, Side 1.

00:31.164 --> 00:32.946
OK, where were you born? I was born in Montague 
County, Texas. February the 24th, 1907. I'm

00:37.694 --> 00:41.258
sorry, 1905. I guess you didn't have to volunteer 
that, but that's fine. Were your parents from that

00:48.626 --> 00:50.509
same area? Yes. Yes, my father was a veteran in the 
Spanish-American War. My mother was born there, I

00:58.298 --> 01:01.201
suppose. My mother died when I was really young. I 
never did know much about my mother's family. But

01:06.518 --> 01:09.001
he was a veteran in the Spanish-American War. 
Well, yes, he was a soldier in the

01:09.021 --> 01:12.165
Spanish-American War. And what did he do for a 
living? Farmer. He was a farmer. So therefore you

01:17.911 --> 01:20.634
worked on the farm when you were younger? Yes, yes. 
What type of things did you raise? Everything that

01:25.960 --> 01:35.952
a farm in West Texas, agricultural products, feed 
stuff, cotton, cattle, of course we had cattle,

01:25.960 --> 01:35.952
ranch. Okay.

01:41.543 --> 01:46.188
How much formal education did you have since you 
worked on the farm? Were you able to go to high

01:46.208 --> 01:49.171
school? Yes, I went to school in Little Town of 
Mundy, Texas, Knox County. In 1923, I came to Allen

01:56.658 --> 02:06.327
Academy here in Bryan, and that's where I got my 
more formal education, here in Bryan. Allen

02:06.577 --> 02:09.340
Academy at that time was a military high school. 
Oh, I see. Why did you decide to go to Allen Academy?

02:14.425 --> 02:15.547
Well, that's a long story. It involved athletics. 
I lived with the sweetest old aunt in the world in

02:21.012 --> 02:24.156
the little town of Mundy.

02:26.999 --> 02:29.722
And she really loved me and took care of me. I got 
interested in track and athletics.

02:35.753 --> 02:44.421
I won the county meet for the little high school on 
Monday, and they sent me to the district meet in

02:35.753 --> 02:44.421
Vernon, Texas. And I won there, and they made a lot 
of money to send me to Austin for the high school

02:46.382 --> 02:53.349
track meet. I went on my own. They made enough money 
to pay me away, but I didn't have a coach.

03:01.976 --> 03:03.938
Oh, OK. All right.

03:06.837 --> 03:11.904
The preliminaries of the track meet is on Friday in 
Austin. Still are, I suppose. That day I had a

03:13.787 --> 03:18.514
pretty good day in running in the dashes. And then 
on Saturday, which is a final, a gentleman by the

03:19.416 --> 03:30.051
name of Charlie Hudson got a hold of me and took me 
over to his little gang. And he was from Bryan,

03:30.071 --> 03:31.553
Texas. He had been the athletic coach at Bryan. And 
that summer, he had already contracted. This was

03:40.343 --> 03:41.945
in May of 1923. He had contracted to go to Allen 
Academy as an athletic coach. And he made friends

03:48.011 --> 03:53.757
with me and took me over and gave me some 
instructions. And I had a pretty good day. And when

03:56.700 --> 04:01.285
I went about my business, I worked through the 
harvest fields that summer of 23. And Mr. Hudson

04:01.666 --> 04:06.831
got in touch with me by mail. He had my name and 
address and told me he had a job that would pay my

04:07.385 --> 04:14.914
expenses if I'd come to Allen Academy. That would 
be the fall of 23. And with that, I accepted that

04:16.616 --> 04:23.004
proposition and came to Allen Academy. And so you 
were an athlete then? Yes. Did you attend more

04:28.110 --> 04:31.994
state championship? I mean, did you win any type 
of? Well, we... We had a fine track team here at

04:35.262 --> 04:37.665
Allen Academy. And that spring, Allen had a track 
team that was good enough that they qualified for

04:38.326 --> 04:48.459
track meet, for some meet events in Chicago for the 
National Scholastic Meet. And they sent me up

04:49.240 --> 04:50.462
there. Oh, really? Chicago? Yes, I won the second 
and 220-yard dash, I believe it was, and third, the

04:52.064 --> 04:58.373
100-yard dash. Well, that's wonderful.

05:04.270 --> 05:08.797
And on the way from Chicago, that would be in the 
spring of 24, wouldn't it? That would be the spring

05:09.939 --> 05:11.482
of 24. And I worked in farming one thing or another 
during the summer of 24, then came back to Allen

05:11.522 --> 05:22.420
Academy that year. We had a fine athletic team, 
football. I had never played football until I came

05:26.847 --> 05:30.413
to Allen Academy. And I was invited to come out for 
the team, and did, and made the team. We had a good

05:37.462 --> 05:39.124
team in 24. We, among other teams that we played, 
was a Texas A&M freshman. Oh, you did? You played

05:47.231 --> 05:48.552
the freshman? I had a pretty good day against the 
freshman, Mr. Bible, who was head coach at Texas

05:49.693 --> 05:58.982
A&M at that time, Mr. D-X Bible. shook hands with 
him and I met him and kept in contact with him. And

06:04.289 --> 06:22.629
then when school, when I graduated Allen Academy 
in 1925, I worked again in the harvest fields as I

06:04.289 --> 06:22.629
generally did in summers and then came to Allen 
Academy, I mean to Texas A&M in the fall of 25 as a

06:04.289 --> 06:22.629
freshman. Were you on some kind of football team? 
Yes. Oh, that's wonderful. Well, scholarships

06:28.107 --> 06:41.923
such as we had those days, it doesn't like to wear 
that, but I had a little old job that helped me pay my

06:28.107 --> 06:41.923
expenses and pay the tuition and all. So the 
freshmen didn't participate in varsity sports at

06:44.406 --> 06:52.035
that time. We just played as freshmen. Then, of 
course, in my sophomore year, which would be this

06:54.953 --> 07:04.484
fall of 26, then I was on the varsity team from then 
on until I graduated. What was your degree? What

07:05.846 --> 07:07.387
degree did you get? A business degree. Is that when 
you got interested in real estate then? Or how did

07:16.258 --> 07:17.359
you get interested? All right. My athletics, I'm 
indebted very largely to athletics scholarship

07:25.008 --> 07:32.058
for my education, whatever I got, because I went 
out for track and football. We had some fine teams

07:32.659 --> 07:34.602
when I was here. I was also taken into the Athletic 
Hall of Fame a few years ago. Well, that's

07:41.291 --> 07:43.014
wonderful. Well, it is for me. That's a great 
honor, great achievement for me.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.390
Now, you asked about real estate. I graduated from 
A&M in 1929, which was a bad time. Depression was

08:02.668 --> 08:06.834
coming on, and there wasn't very many of us that got 
jobs. I was able to get a job

08:08.656 --> 08:18.630
with the United States Agriculture Department.

08:19.591 --> 08:21.774
You've heard of the Mediterranean fruit fly? Yes. 
Well, that year it was tacking. the Rio Grande

08:25.522 --> 08:40.376
Valley from Mexico, and the government was 
hiring, but I had some courses in, and I can speak

08:25.522 --> 08:40.376
Spanish, and so I was out of 15 or 20 boys in our class 
that got a job that year. I got a job in Brownsville,

08:41.357 --> 08:53.588
and

08:41.357 --> 08:53.588
I stayed down there about a year or so, and as young 
men will do, I got to courting. I was going to ask you

08:56.533 --> 08:59.136
about that. And of course courting will lead to 
marriage. And I married in October of 1930.

09:07.987 --> 09:11.412
Married that President Walton's daughter. Oh, 
you did? And her name is? Ethel, E-T-H-Y-L. Ethel.

09:19.862 --> 09:20.002
Walton. And then I moved here.

09:27.487 --> 09:32.612
And got into real estate activity on the south side 
of the NM campus. Bought a tract of land down there,

09:34.013 --> 09:37.076
75, 8 acres. And cut it into lots and blocks. Sold it 
as residential property. That was before the city

09:47.526 --> 09:49.367
was organized. And that was quite a problem, quite 
a job to do all of that. I was going to ask you about

09:53.371 --> 09:55.333
how How did you handle these type of things before? 
Well, I'd had courses leading up to that helpful

09:59.121 --> 10:02.666
thing. I had economics. I wasn't called 
agricultural engineering then, but it was a

10:04.629 --> 10:08.675
business course. And I took economics and some 
surveying and a course in banking and one thing or

10:09.657 --> 10:17.609
another. And that all helped me. I, of course, 
relied on friends more than anything else. For

10:28.334 --> 10:33.040
some reason or other, the Lord has given me an 
abundance of friends. Some of them had money, and

10:33.120 --> 10:38.547
they helped me out buying this property. There 
wasn't any city here, and it made it very tough. I

10:45.215 --> 10:47.878
had to put in on streets and all the utilities. 
That's what I was wondering. Yeah. So... Your

10:54.106 --> 10:55.448
Oakwood Realty Company? Yes. When you bought that 
75 acres? That's right. I formed a corporation.

10:59.933 --> 11:02.176
And what year was that? That was 1933. My 32, I 
guess, 1932, formed that corporation. And

11:12.108 --> 11:15.693
subdivided that tract of land. It was on the south 
side of the A&M campus. Then undertook to... Got

11:22.051 --> 11:23.973
some utilities in there. And how do you do that? 
Well, take water, for example.

11:31.659 --> 11:35.082
Wasn't any kind of a public water system here. And I 
was able to talk to the board directors of A&M. Let

11:41.408 --> 11:45.492
me tie on to the A&M system for water. And of course, 
I had to pay for all that, the pipe and get it under

11:45.512 --> 11:50.556
the ground. install all the supplies for it. So you 
built from the south side to the A&M campus border?

12:00.340 --> 12:17.202
Well, I joined the A&M campus on the south side, but 
I had to lay the water lines from their water supply

12:00.340 --> 12:17.202
system, their wells, to the land, and then that's 
across the south side of the campus now. Oh, where

12:17.806 --> 12:20.710
you see the kids playing ball out there? Oh, yeah. 
It's on campus now then? Where you joined in, where

12:25.257 --> 12:28.081
they're out there playing ball? Well, that's A&M 
property, my property. You know Jersey Street?

12:32.468 --> 12:32.848
Right. Well, Jersey was a dirt road at that time. 
And then my property was from Jersey on down that

12:37.685 --> 12:40.829
way. So you had to personally lay the water lines 
and then A&M? And pay for the pipe and the water and

12:47.518 --> 12:50.762
the labor and so forth. Same for the sewer system. 
We had to put in the sewer system.

12:58.112 --> 13:02.417
Each residence, they're required to have a septic 
tank. I think you probably know what a septic tank

13:03.619 --> 13:05.982
is. A septic tank's a a whole rectangular piece as 
big as this table here, but even deeper. And the

13:14.263 --> 13:21.272
effluent from the sewer lines and the commodes and 
the drains in the house went into the septic tank.

13:21.292 --> 13:22.954
And that was disposed of. Then we had a line to it 
that carried the effluent out from the septic tank

13:23.635 --> 13:29.602
into a purifying plant. We had, way down there, 
about half a mile away, had put that in as a

13:29.642 --> 13:35.569
purification system. So the sewer didn't go to 
A&M. No. You put in another plant yourself. We put

13:40.839 --> 13:44.484
in another stewarded disposal system 
altogether. And then, of course, we got

13:45.525 --> 13:48.709
electricity from the university at the time. And 
you had to put in the lines? Had to put in the poles,

13:50.572 --> 13:54.277
the lines, and all of that. Well, did they agree to 
do that if you had so many residents living, you

13:54.898 --> 14:02.609
know, getting so many residents? Or did it help to, 
I guess you knew, President

14:06.194 --> 14:12.644
Walton, your father-in-law, did that help? Well, 
it probably did. I didn't deal with him. I dealt

14:15.729 --> 14:16.570
with the board. They had to prove everything they 
did.

14:25.432 --> 14:32.269
The gas, of course, we got the gas supply from the 
Lone Star Gas Company, which is still here, of

14:25.432 --> 14:32.269
course. And we had to put in the pipe for that. Very 
expensive undertaking at that time. And still is,

14:39.326 --> 14:43.035
of course, more expensive than ever. But it's very 
most difficult to not have any money to operate

14:43.184 --> 14:48.431
with. I'd sell a lot and use that to do something 
else. Oh, I see. But the board of AM didn't say that

14:52.216 --> 15:01.107
we'll allow you to hook up to our utility, say you 
have 10 residents in your area? No. No, they didn't

15:01.288 --> 15:02.189
make any restrictions? No, they didn't. They had 
to just do it by the residents or by whatever. Okay.

15:06.263 --> 15:07.004
Just whatever. Now I did try to develop the 
property in contiguous joints, contiguous

15:07.064 --> 15:18.321
parts, so that I have the utilities there and it's 
moving 75, 80 feet to another house and so on. They

15:19.282 --> 15:26.634
were, the people before this time, the faculty, 
basically lived on campus, didn't they? Yes,

15:26.954 --> 15:30.960
there's very few that lived off the campus, very 
few. And that was my proposition, to give them an

15:31.227 --> 15:39.500
opportunity to have their own home off the campus. 
They couldn't own a home on the campus. The

15:42.084 --> 15:46.691
university owned all the residence property on 
the campus, on the A&M property. They couldn't own

15:47.633 --> 15:48.915
it. And what they rented it. They had certain 
houses available for certain professors or

15:51.719 --> 15:57.488
employees. dean's houses and all of that you know 
they had dean's row where the deans lived oh they

15:58.109 --> 16:26.698
they had a certain section for the dean or a certain 
house that's where the president's house is now

15:58.109 --> 16:26.698
you know see there's there's homes all through 
there then most of them are moving away you don't

15:58.109 --> 16:26.698
see any homes in there well were the board of 
directors interested in getting people to move

15:58.109 --> 16:26.698
off was it oh yes they helped them they'd be 
whatever assistance they could to get them to

16:26.965 --> 16:28.086
provide their own homes. They encouraged 
ownership of homes. And that, well, in about 1933,

16:31.890 --> 16:42.281
President Roosevelt was elected. The impression 
was awful enough. And he created what they called

16:45.745 --> 16:48.487
the Federal Housing Administration. And the 
purpose of that Federal Housing Administration

16:49.569 --> 16:53.192
was to help people own their homes. And I took 
advantage of that system as best I could. I had a

16:57.458 --> 17:18.506
friend who was a

16:57.458 --> 17:18.506
chief officer in the Houston District, and he 
helped me get lined up with the Federal Housing

16:57.458 --> 17:18.506
Administration and some of that Folkwood 
addition that I had developed down at the Oakwood

16:57.458 --> 17:18.506
Realty Company that we were talking about. It was 
the first FHA-approved area between Houston and

17:19.507 --> 17:26.757
Dallas, and this man helped me He helped me with 
that. I can't say his first name.

17:32.824 --> 17:44.160
H-U-M-P-H-R-I-E-S.

17:32.824 --> 17:44.160
About the 26th class, the 27th class of A&M.

17:45.021 --> 17:46.583
No, they didn't have any money to lend. I get that. I 
had loan connections, mostly through the

17:48.646 --> 17:53.453
American General Insurance Company in Houston. 
they would make a loan for a house for proper anyone

17:54.884 --> 18:02.875
if the FHA would guarantee the loan to be paid. So 
for example, if you wanted to buy a house, and it was

18:05.459 --> 18:24.064
a very modern scheme up to date, up to that time, you 
could build a very fine house for $10,000,

18:05.459 --> 18:24.064
$20,000, the best in the area.

18:25.647 --> 18:28.591
The lenders at that time were insurance companies 
and mortgage companies. They'd loan about half

18:28.611 --> 18:29.974
that. If you loaned $12,000, they'd lend about 
$6,000. And the rules of repayment was 10 years.

18:37.525 --> 18:39.688
You had to pay it back monthly in a 10-year period. 
The FHA come along. Instead of loaning 50%, they'd

18:41.631 --> 18:44.475
loan 90%. So your $10,000 house, you'd need $1,000 
to pay down. Generally, if you had the lot, that was

18:50.324 --> 18:52.127
enough. Then they made the payments up to 20 years, 
instead of 10 years. And the interest rate was 5%,

18:57.977 --> 19:02.162
5.5% instead of 8.5% or 9%. And that 
revolutionized the home building. And I took

19:07.489 --> 19:08.771
advantage of that. And it made it easy for the 
profs, for the professors, and other A&M

19:08.811 --> 19:15.879
employees to buy their own homes. And they just 
feel that's about a little dish of nut down there

19:15.919 --> 19:19.704
pretty quick. Well, so really, you gained a great 
advantage by being aware of the needs on campus and

19:21.571 --> 19:29.622
what the government was providing? That's right. 
And availability of money at the very best

19:30.142 --> 19:34.408
possible rates for the people. And it worked fine. 
And we just had things going all the time. And then

19:41.978 --> 19:50.329
about 1938, I sold out that, developed it, and then 
bought a piece of land here on the north side of the

19:51.743 --> 19:53.966
campus. And we called that addition North 
Oakwood. The other was just plain Oakwood. But on

19:59.315 --> 20:01.578
the north end, we called it North Oakwood. And I 
went in and developed that on the same idea. It

20:04.683 --> 20:08.389
wasn't in the city either, either Bryan or 
College. It's in the city of Bryan now. Oh, it is?

20:15.360 --> 20:15.460
Yeah. To get you located maybe where it is, do you 
know where it is? That

20:22.625 --> 20:30.276
was my first business. That was my first little 
business development. What do you call it? A mall?

20:36.986 --> 20:37.908
That was my first mall. I started that in 1938. And 
does it have, is it Brookside that runs through?

20:46.927 --> 20:48.670
Yeah, that's my street. I named that street. 
Brookside and all those other streets in there.

20:52.839 --> 20:54.242
Brookside Drive. And so in 38, that didn't belong 
to Brian. No, Brian's city limits didn't come out

20:57.286 --> 21:00.051
that far. I had to do it, poor boy, if you will, just 
like I did the air on the south side. I had to put in my

21:06.040 --> 21:11.169
own streets, dug my own water well, couldn't get it 
from A&M. I had to dig my own water well and had an

21:11.189 --> 21:17.880
elevated tank, furnish water to the residents to 
begin with. And that moved real fast. real fast

21:23.223 --> 21:29.851
farmland under the same FHA operation as they're 
doing on the south side. People that you might know

21:32.054 --> 21:34.937
live, lots and lots of A&M people. Live in that 
area? Live there now and did then. They were

21:38.461 --> 21:41.585
primarily the ones that bought the property and 
built lovely homes. It's very close to the

21:42.086 --> 21:43.928
university. Yeah, that's right. What did College 
Station, I guess, Right before it was

21:50.560 --> 21:53.183
incorporated, what did it look like? Was it 
basically open prairie? Well, except on the

21:57.708 --> 22:05.216
campuses, just simply rural country, just open 
farmland. On the east gate here, you know, that was

22:06.057 --> 22:11.563
all farmland. It was in cotton, and there wasn't 
any residences. Texas Avenue was a dirt road.

22:19.231 --> 22:27.660
Jersey Street was a dirt and gravel road, which 
wasn't near as wide as it is now, just a country

22:19.231 --> 22:27.660
lane, that's all it was. And at the north gate where 
the post office is over there, you know, that post

22:28.241 --> 22:40.254
office was placed there about, oh what, 1935 or 36. 
You know where the post office is. And there's two

22:43.277 --> 22:46.040
or three stores across the street from it. The 
grocery store, Been there a good many years,

22:47.767 --> 22:50.030
called Luke and Charlie. And there was a drug store 
there. Lipscomb? Well, not at first. Lipscomb

23:00.502 --> 23:01.523
wasn't there.

23:04.486 --> 23:08.832
Casey and Sparks had a little pharmacy there, 
really. A fellow named Burtis, B-U-R-T-I-S, not

23:10.173 --> 23:16.120
money, ran the store. And then Lipscomb did come 
there, and they built his father-in-law, who was

23:16.758 --> 23:22.786
Dr. E.J. Kyle. I'm sorry. Dr. E.J. wasn't Dr. 
Lipscomb's father-in-law. They were related.

23:31.497 --> 23:32.078
They were related? No, they're not related at all. 
But that Dean Kyle was the agriculture dean at A&M,

23:34.401 --> 23:41.030
and he built this two-story building there. And 
Lipscomb did operate a drugstore out of that

23:41.050 --> 23:45.195
two-story building. Mrs. Lipscomb still lives on 
the south side in my addition that I've developed

23:46.559 --> 23:55.172
down there in Oakwood Addition. I sold them a home 
down there. It was about 35, 36, somewhere back in

23:58.837 --> 24:01.481
there. Well, a lot of residents, it seems like a lot 
of residents still live there. Oh, yes. It's full

24:07.430 --> 24:09.393
of some of the old-timers. That's good. They were 
happy with it. Yeah. We used to have a cage there.

24:15.938 --> 24:23.565
Lee Street was a, I built the first house on Lee 
Street, and we didn't even have Lee Street in

24:15.938 --> 24:23.565
there. We had it designated, but it hadn't been 
graded out. How did you provide for the streets?

24:29.710 --> 24:30.931
You had to build those too? Yes, I had to put them in. 
Contract with some company to lay? Yes, I had to

24:35.355 --> 24:37.457
contract with a street building company. They 
were very poor. What were they made of? They had to

24:41.400 --> 24:44.663
grade it up, just had the street graded up. And then 
made them all surface by gravel. They weren't

24:48.836 --> 24:54.645
paved, I don't suppose, until probably after 
World War II. I'm not quite sure about that. And the

24:56.167 --> 24:58.190
city did that then? Yes. It was incorporated then. 
Yes, the city was organized about 1938, wasn't it?

25:02.117 --> 25:02.397
38, right. And

25:02.737 --> 25:12.152
then the city then bought the utility lines from me 
and we took over the streets and maintained them

25:12.217 --> 25:18.434
and paid them. But originally you as the developer 
had to provide for that. That's right. We had a

25:23.448 --> 25:27.981
little taxing system that we charged so much per 
lot really is on a front-foot basis. If you had a

25:31.357 --> 25:36.484
50-foot lot, you'd pay taxes on the basis of 50 
foot. If I had a 100-foot lot, then I'd pay on the 100

25:36.504 --> 25:39.989
feet and so forth. How were they kept up? Just had a 
private man live down around Wellborn. That

25:50.644 --> 25:55.791
included the sewage pickup or garbage pickup. 
There's always a little comical comedy attached

25:57.222 --> 26:00.147
to that. This old black man had a wagon and mules, 
and it was his job to pick up the garbage. We paid him

26:09.581 --> 26:13.247
out of this tax money. I handled that, but I 
collected the taxes. They had a taxing system, and

26:18.788 --> 26:28.337
I paid for the garbage pickup and upkeep of the 
streets. They'd have to be graded every so often.

26:30.980 --> 26:36.525
And I paid for that out of this tax money. This old 
Negro, his name was Rum, R-U-M. He had this team and

26:45.574 --> 26:48.357
a mule and a wagon. It had about three or four kids. 
And they were kids, but I say the oldest, one was,

26:52.092 --> 26:56.619
say, 11, 12, then on down. And they'd always start 
in the wagon. Another little white kid would

26:58.041 --> 27:00.405
follow them around in that wagon. And he had two or 
three dogs that he lashed onto the wagon with a

27:01.206 --> 27:06.835
string or something that they just It's kind of a 
comedy to see him coming. To see him going down the

27:09.172 --> 27:11.256
street to pick up the trash? Yeah, the kids 
following, hollering, carrying on. And he did

27:14.941 --> 27:16.603
that for several years. Well, so the city is 
organizing. The city took over. Oh, that's

27:19.588 --> 27:20.710
wonderful. That's the type of thing. Well, it's 
real country. It's real backward country doing

27:22.492 --> 27:25.437
it. But we had about all we could do in those days. 
But that's the type of thing that people like me do

27:28.661 --> 27:32.687
not, you know. Don't realize it now. Just don't 
realize. In fact, it was a pretty hard time. There

27:38.590 --> 27:43.457
was no fire level. We had a fire on Lee Street.

27:48.885 --> 27:50.868
An architectural prop lived in the house. I 
believe his name was Jack Finney. His house caught

27:55.455 --> 27:59.280
fire. There's a dry lake, which you happen to know 
on the south side of the company.

28:07.379 --> 28:10.403
It's called Bryson Pond or Bryson Park now. Was it 
full of water then? Yes, it was full of water. Oh,

28:13.027 --> 28:13.808
okay. Yeah, I know where that is. And two or three 
fires we had, the water was pumped from that pond,

28:15.591 --> 28:27.248
from that lake, and the hose was stretched out to 
wherever the fire was. And it wasn't much of a fire

28:28.370 --> 28:30.733
system, but that's all they had. Oh, you couldn't 
depend on the university? No, not at that time. Not

28:36.269 --> 28:37.551
at that time. So the only thing you had was just the 
pond? That's the pond. That's the fire water we

28:40.554 --> 28:42.116
had. We didn't have any lines big enough to carry 
the water. Six-inch lines. The fire plug didn't

28:48.665 --> 28:52.510
have any fire plug to attach it to. So it was pretty 
rugged living. But so the Oakwood started about

28:57.596 --> 29:02.322
like 1932, you would say? No. Let's say, I think we 
got the corporation in 1933. Let's say 1934.

29:12.488 --> 29:17.853
Oakwood really started developing that area in 
there. And this is the way they had to live until you

29:18.234 --> 29:22.718
incorporated the city. That's right. My house is 
known as 112 Lee Avenue, and it was the first house

29:23.259 --> 29:28.324
on Lee Street. That's 1935 when we built it. But it 
wasn't the first house on the south side, was it?

29:34.353 --> 29:35.455
Oh, no, no. Because you have College Park. No, the 
College Park now. College Park was developed,

29:39.320 --> 29:44.287
started about 1923 or 24. Of course, I had nothing 
to do with that. That was some college professors

29:47.632 --> 29:56.124
owned, organized what they called College Park 
Development Company. Dr. Clark? Yes. Who? Dr.

30:00.130 --> 30:00.951
Clark. Dr. F.B. Clark. He was one of the 
organizers. And Dr. Burchard was a chemistry

30:06.133 --> 30:08.577
trial. He was in it. And about three or four others 
whose names are kind of left now. I can't see the

30:16.287 --> 30:17.870
names anymore. But there's five of them, as I 
remember. And they developed what is known as

30:20.293 --> 30:25.560
College Park Edition. About 1923. It started 
about 1923 or 1924.

30:30.833 --> 30:36.040
Well, later on, College Park and Oakwood have a 
joint association. What year was that? Yes. I

30:39.865 --> 30:49.719
bought the unsold lots in College Park, Oakwood 
Realty Company did, in 1936, let's say. They had,

30:51.261 --> 30:57.870
oh, maybe 100, 150 unsold lots, undeveloped lots, 
and I bought them. and then proceeded to develop

30:58.475 --> 31:02.860
them and sell them out as Oakwood Realty Company. 
We connected streets. It would be interesting,

31:07.325 --> 31:13.772
very interesting, if we had an abstract of College 
Park. The map's entirely different now from what

31:13.792 --> 31:18.277
it was then. They had properties laid out for 
colored people, blacks. Oh, really? Yeah. You

31:24.504 --> 31:26.827
know where Fairview Street is? Do you? Fairview 
Street ran off from the campus southward and came

31:28.293 --> 31:36.544
to a square like that. Here's a street here. And 
let's see.

31:45.776 --> 31:46.817
This is Fairview. This is what's now is

31:47.818 --> 31:54.667
Jersey Street. Fairview Street ran down here and 
ran into a little square like that. This was

32:00.519 --> 32:03.663
designated as a Negro church. Was it a church 
actually there? Yeah, it was actually there. To go

32:10.012 --> 32:14.597
around that you'd have to come down the street and 
go down like that.

32:17.441 --> 32:26.733
This is the church and when I bought the lots I 
undertook to get rid of that sort of situation

32:17.441 --> 32:26.733
because fire trucks couldn't get down through 
there. They hadn't even thought of that. And we

32:29.127 --> 32:34.635
changed that around, and there was Negro people 
living along here. And that was designated for

32:35.876 --> 32:40.944
them when they laid out College Park? That's 
right. Very interesting. It is interesting. Did

32:44.148 --> 32:47.273
you have that type of sectioning in Oakwood? No. 
No. No, we didn't have that in Oakwood. We didn't

32:51.779 --> 32:52.620
even... There's been many additions here in the 
South, all through the South, and certainly in

32:53.849 --> 32:58.056
Texas. In Brazos County, niggers were prohibited 
from buying property, and that's been outlawed

32:58.136 --> 33:07.591
now. Right. Yeah. And FHA, Federal Housing 
Administration, had a lot to do with it. If you...

33:19.010 --> 33:19.931
What do you call it? What word am I trying to say? 
Discriminate? That word? Discriminate?

33:24.037 --> 33:24.638
Discriminate. That's the word. If you 
discriminate against anybody for race or color or

33:25.780 --> 33:33.631
religion, it was a violation of law. You couldn't 
get any money to build a house through FHA. So I

33:37.637 --> 33:39.360
never did get in there. But anyway, when I bought 
that, I took all this out. Got these people that

33:42.244 --> 33:43.646
lived here. And... traded with them, traded 
property that, do you know where the Lincoln

33:47.427 --> 33:54.159
School is down on the south side? That's where they 
went. That was the Negro property. And most of them

33:58.125 --> 34:00.409
came from this little area right there. So when you 
bought it, they moved from this area to Lincoln?

34:04.797 --> 34:10.106
When you bought the rest of College Park, the Negro 
families living here moved to Lincoln? Yes, I gave

34:10.507 --> 34:13.131
them property down there for property here. And 
then, like, you went ahead and just... We just took

34:13.297 --> 34:15.561
this out. We just took that and straightened it on 
out and made it a through street and made these

34:15.581 --> 34:20.468
residential lots. Oh, that's very interesting.

34:25.837 --> 34:30.384
Yes, it'd be interesting for you to develop, and 
you must do it if you...

34:32.708 --> 34:40.941
I don't know what extent for your writing the 
school

34:32.708 --> 34:40.941
thing might not require it, but in a book it'd be 
interesting. Because certain people couldn't

34:41.714 --> 34:46.881
associate with Negroes. When you bought a lot from 
Dr. Clark and those patients over there,

34:47.162 --> 34:59.660
if a white and a dark and a black person associated, 
they got married. They automatically gave title.

35:03.025 --> 35:06.530
They lost the title to their property. I don't know 
that that ever came. I don't think it stood up in any

35:07.912 --> 35:10.135
kind of law. But that was what was in those 
abstracts when I bought the clock. Of course, I

35:13.285 --> 35:15.968
immediately took it out. And

35:15.988 --> 35:23.859
they weren't even permitted to associate 
together as dates, for example. And certain

35:24.720 --> 35:27.063
intermarriages were absolutely prohibited. I 
can imagine. I mean, you have a certain sense of

35:30.848 --> 35:38.158
that today, but what is that, 50 years ago would be 
even more. Yeah, 60, 70 years ago, maybe. And you

35:41.080 --> 35:45.526
know a lot of those people from the North, too, that 
made those sort of rules. I know. Even though they

35:46.748 --> 35:51.754
were fighting for... For freedom of the slave 
people. I had a question. I ran across some

35:56.300 --> 35:57.883
information. They said, I guess, area further 
south was owned by the Federal Land Bank of

35:58.804 --> 36:05.152
Houston. Does that ring a bell? I had no knowledge 
of the Federal... Well, I'm sure the Federal Land

36:10.460 --> 36:20.114
Bank owned property throughout the county. The 
Federal Land Bank didn't really own land to

36:20.695 --> 36:26.344
develop or to farm. It made loans if you had a farm 
and you needed some equipment. Or maybe the whole

36:30.997 --> 36:32.920
farm. You might borrow money from the federal land 
bank to buy the farm, or to buy farm machinery or

36:32.940 --> 36:42.354
equipment. And of course, sometimes they had 
defaults where people failed to pay and they had to

36:42.414 --> 36:47.702
seize the land. But they'd seize it and then 
repossess it, we say. That's a term we use,

36:51.748 --> 36:53.591
repossess. And then resend it to somebody else. 
But I never knew of any federal... land bank

36:59.583 --> 37:03.649
federal farm blown down in that area. Well, it was 
in a newspaper and it made reference to the federal

37:03.969 --> 37:10.638
land bank and then the Whitesell estate. Does that 
ring a bell? What? The Whitesell,

37:12.060 --> 37:17.067
W-E-I-N-Z-E-T-L estate. No, I don't know 
anything about that. Okay, that's fine.

37:30.532 --> 37:32.614
You made me to make remarks. Well, I was just 
wondering what were some of the factors that

37:32.634 --> 37:38.220
brought about the incorporation of . Well, the 
principal factor was for the citizens to obtain

37:38.240 --> 38:00.083
the services that you can get from city 
organizations, such as police, for example, had

37:38.240 --> 38:00.083
no pleas, and the utilities, and maintenance of 
the utility streets. other assets of the city

38:00.603 --> 38:03.486
office. And it was necessary to have some sort of an 
organization to control. We're just doing

38:09.171 --> 38:11.634
everything, you know. Developers such as 
yourself. Yeah, well, developers, yeah, such as

38:12.595 --> 38:15.798
me and others. And they had no laws. Might only 
build a barn right out in the middle of somebody's

38:18.761 --> 38:24.466
yard, you know. They had no control. There's 
plenty of urgent need for a city organization. And

38:30.252 --> 38:33.515
I urged that the best I could as a youngster. I never 
took any action in any of the city offices or city

38:33.615 --> 38:48.529
elections

38:33.615 --> 38:48.529
when I developed what we call West Park Edition 
over on next to the railroad over there. You know,

38:49.650 --> 38:53.874
on the south side of the A&M campus, another little 
mall down there that I put in. The south side? South

38:55.656 --> 38:56.297
side. South side shopping center there. That's 
mine. We didn't call them malls in those days. We

39:01.659 --> 39:03.381
just called them shopping centers. And the city 
was, I bought that property. What day did I buy that

39:08.266 --> 39:10.369
property?

39:14.033 --> 39:15.775
Oh, I must have been 38. And

39:15.895 --> 39:21.421
the city was getting organized. And they were 
going to have a zoning ordinance, zoning

39:21.481 --> 39:28.609
regulation. That was a little unusual in this area 
of Texas. I'm sure in the bigger cities, zoning was

39:31.953 --> 39:36.458
common. Well, I had bought that tract of land there 
where this shopping center is, Southside

39:38.300 --> 39:45.929
Shopping Center. Oh, there's 60, 70 acres back in 
there. And it belonged to a Czech family. Came from

39:55.680 --> 39:58.663
the old country.

40:00.128 --> 40:01.749
They're very, very poor people. Mrs. Hardricka? 
No, that's another part. I know the Hardrickas.

40:14.660 --> 40:15.681
It wasn't Schwartz. Schwartz is a family I bought 
the Oakwood property from. I can't say it. But

40:23.308 --> 40:29.393
anyway, this widow lived there about where, let me 
see. there on the corner where that two-story

40:30.588 --> 40:34.894
building, I put that building there. He had a 
little check in the house there. There wasn't

40:37.778 --> 40:40.982
anything across the street on that A&M property, 
just blank. She had one cow and some chickens. Went

40:44.807 --> 40:46.369
around barefooted all the time. Very poor. And I 
bought that property from them. And I paid what I

40:53.078 --> 40:59.667
thought was a big price for the property then, 
about $150 an acre. But I thought the best chance of

41:00.912 --> 41:11.265
coming out on it was to Long Jersey Street there to 
make a little business center out of that. And I

41:13.348 --> 41:19.636
drew up a plan of the area, lots of blocks and so 
forth. And then across the front, Long Jersey

41:19.997 --> 41:23.782
Street there, designated as a commercial area. 
The City of College Station was getting underway.

41:31.760 --> 41:36.126
And they appointed a zoning committee. Again, I 
can't think of any gentleman's name.

41:42.494 --> 41:45.759
And I had an opportunity to go on a hunting trip down 
in old Mexico. And of course, my people knew about

41:48.182 --> 41:55.952
my plans, the city people and all. But while I was 
gone about two weeks, the zoning committee met and

41:55.972 --> 42:01.159
zoomed that along there. as residential 
property. Well, that was ruining me because I

42:04.350 --> 42:11.480
couldn't get any money from residential property 
because I was commercial. So, of course, I got a

42:11.500 --> 42:13.382
hold of the lawyer. Now, the city hadn't formally 
yet organized. There wasn't anything they could

42:15.906 --> 42:17.328
do. They had to post certain signs for so long a 
time, say 30 days or 60 or whatever it was. And so my

42:25.760 --> 42:28.022
lawyer said, well, you just go ahead. And I didn't 
have any intent to build it. The thing didn't have

42:30.265 --> 42:31.967
any money to build it with. The thing in the world. 
But he said, well, put some stuff out there. Haul

42:35.731 --> 42:39.735
some dirt or land or wood or brick or something. I 
said, you're going to start. Well, I did. And then

42:42.438 --> 42:55.412
the zoning commission talked to people who lived 
down there then over about 50, 60 to sign a petition

42:42.438 --> 42:55.412
prohibiting me from developing that and the 
business property. Well, that got to be a joke,

42:57.434 --> 43:05.024
too, because I wanted to sign the petition myself 
against my own building. Of course, they knew

43:05.044 --> 43:09.490
that, and they wouldn't let me sign it. So I just got 
me a petition, and one of them got the same people

43:10.472 --> 43:18.062
who signed mine asking for it as to sign it against 
it. And we went ahead and put the buildings there,

43:18.082 --> 43:23.830
that two-story building. I had a grocery store 
there for a good many years, and it worked fine. It

43:28.236 --> 43:29.036
worked fine. I always remembered the grocery 
part. That was in 1941 when it began to get finished

43:34.521 --> 43:38.665
up. And I was working down there on one Sunday, 
decorating for Christmas, putting some greenery

43:38.685 --> 43:45.711
across the front of it, you know. Had a radio 
upstairs blaring around, and it called a halt to

43:46.172 --> 43:51.777
the music or whatever. And it announced it. the 
Japanese at Mount Pearl Harbor. Oh no. And so I had a

43:57.776 --> 44:01.886
commission in the Army as an A&M graduate. I knew I 
was going to have to go. Excuse me.
