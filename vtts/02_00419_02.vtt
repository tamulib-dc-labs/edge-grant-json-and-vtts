WEBVTT

00:20.264 --> 00:21.725
Four years since I have taught. Yes. And I love it. 
Yes. It's just one of those things. Well, you know,

00:24.568 --> 00:30.614
I love, to me, the second graders were my, was my pet 
group. I love them children. Full of, full of

00:32.236 --> 00:34.558
questions. Full of, I mean, everything is new to 
them. They want to hear everything. And they need

00:39.483 --> 00:41.385
you so badly. You're faster the first year when 
they're so immature. and when they asked for their

00:46.960 --> 00:50.405
mother so desperately. We had a very, very crucial 
situation at Montrose because of lack of space,

00:50.825 --> 01:00.599
which is always the case. Was this school in a 
poorer district of the Grado? Yes, yes. It was in a

01:05.025 --> 01:06.267
poorer district. We had some children of very high 
Income. But scarcely one, two, three, four. Just,

01:14.990 --> 01:17.433
you could count them in your fingers. But first 
grades, I remember when I was a principal, first

01:18.434 --> 01:25.340
graders were always crying. Always crying. And 
there was a little girl who cried every day, so I

01:27.142 --> 01:31.045
told the teacher, you bring it to me. And I told her, 
now look, you've never used a telephone? No. I

01:34.308 --> 01:38.112
said, all right, from now on you're going to answer 
the phone for me. And so she would pick up the

01:38.767 --> 01:43.411
receipt and say, Monroe School. She would say, 
Monroe School. Little things like that. And you

01:46.815 --> 01:57.344
know, that finally gave her the security that she 
was just not being thrown in there and forgotten.

01:58.025 --> 02:00.828
And I insisted, I even asked, I said, well, why? To 
me, I thought, if first graders, if a school as

02:01.268 --> 02:08.655
crowded as we are, could rent a house nearby and 
give the children the atmosphere of home rather

02:08.888 --> 02:22.985
than of school while they get used to it, I think 
they would do better. But of course those were

02:23.886 --> 02:26.910
dreams that I had. I had many dreams.

02:31.822 --> 02:38.388
I don't think of first graders, at least in my 
children's experience, as being particularly

02:31.822 --> 02:38.388
unhappy. I'm sure there are adjustments. They 
were not unhappy, except for my daughter. My

02:43.672 --> 02:47.656
children always attended a private school the 
first years. They went to Mrs. Ellis, and she was a

02:48.357 --> 02:51.139
wonderful teacher. So they did first and second 
grade, or first grade at least. Then from there on,

02:55.703 --> 02:59.206
they would put them in the public schools. But not 
my daughter. She went to Ersinine. which is run by

03:02.669 --> 03:03.830
nuns. And Mariangela started getting sick, and 
she was sick. And every day they would call me at

03:09.777 --> 03:14.502
Montrose and say, Mariangela is sick. So I would 
ask Mr. Barris, he said, all right. Of course, I was

03:16.805 --> 03:17.966
in the office. If I go pick her up, yes, go right 
ahead. So I'd come and pick her up and bring her

03:20.469 --> 03:22.511
home. Or she would, she even walked to my sister's, 
which was about five blocks. And I said, I'm going

03:27.847 --> 03:30.371
to get to the bottom of this. There's something. 
There definitely is something, because she would

03:31.692 --> 03:36.860
actually get sick. The nun, the sister who was 
teaching her the first half year, was fine. But

03:45.893 --> 03:51.421
there was a sister, Ana Maria, who was a great big, 
and she had a heart of gold. But she was very big,

03:51.821 --> 03:56.588
very tall, dressed in black, And the girls, the 
older girls, made her think that Sister Ana Maria

03:57.074 --> 04:06.087
was very, very mean. And if her teacher would walk 
out of the room, the older girls knew what would

04:06.949 --> 04:13.618
scare her. So they told her, Sister Ana Maria is 
going to take our class. And that just petrified

04:18.205 --> 04:21.550
her. I really had to search. and get to the bottom of 
it. And so I decided, I went to the sisters and I told

04:29.254 --> 04:35.161
them what my problem was. And I said, I want you, 
would you please, would you consider coming over

04:35.821 --> 04:55.903
to the house, and it was during more or less around 
Christmas time, and let Maria Angela show you the

04:35.821 --> 04:55.903
Christmas tree and the,

04:35.821 --> 04:55.903
we always put the nacimiento.

04:56.812 --> 04:58.994
And I told Maria Angela, we're going to have 
guests. You know who's coming? Sister Cornelius,

05:00.375 --> 05:02.757
I believe that was her name. Sister, I can't 
remember the other one. And Sister Ana Maria. And I

05:06.320 --> 05:08.922
said, yes, she's coming to see us. And so they came. 
And they sat in our living room over there. And

05:15.388 --> 05:23.715
Sister Ana Maria held her little hand, which I'm 
sure was like a piece of ice. She was frozen. She

05:26.579 --> 05:31.346
realized that Sister Ana Maria was just a big 
woman. But she wasn't going to hurt anybody. And

05:35.211 --> 05:37.574
she finished high school. She went to a whole 
school there. Then she went to Incarnate Work

05:40.538 --> 05:44.844
College. And then during her senior year, when she 
lacked, oh I'd say about a semester and maybe a

05:46.146 --> 05:55.759
summer. She decided she wanted to get married.

06:02.469 --> 06:07.056
We tried to talk sense into her, but no, she 
wouldn't have it any other way. My son-in-law,

06:08.197 --> 06:14.506
whom I'm very happy that she married, was in the 
Army. In fact, he still is in the Army. Is he from

06:16.969 --> 06:17.650
here? No, he is from Canada, but his family came to 
Florida. Then Bob became an American citizen and

06:26.738 --> 06:32.446
as soon as he was out of college, he was drafted. And 
he went into the Army and he met Maria Angela in San

06:33.267 --> 06:36.771
Antonio. He was in Kellyfield, I think. Yeah, 
Kellyfield is Army. And that's where he met her and

06:43.841 --> 06:53.093
that's where they met and then he was transferred 
to the state of Washington.

06:53.153 --> 06:55.817
And that's when they decided they wanted to get 
married. So my husband said, well, go to San

06:56.303 --> 07:00.889
Antonio and see if you can convince her. I said, no, 
I can't. Couldn't do it. So we came home and she got

07:03.432 --> 07:10.281
married in a big hurry and left for Washington and 
then came back. And then Bob was sent to Vietnam.

07:19.287 --> 07:21.450
And those were very trying days for her. I know they 
were. And her baby was born while he was in Vietnam.

07:25.295 --> 07:28.459
Mary Catherine was born while my husband was in 
Korea. Is that right? Mm-hmm. The war was not going

07:29.921 --> 07:35.129
on at the time, but 13 months separation is very 
bad. Very bad. Anyway. And so that was it. And then

07:42.298 --> 07:44.621
he came... Oh, he was... He's two years old. 
Mm-hmm. So he... decided that he was going to do

07:49.055 --> 07:51.038
something else. And he found a position, or John, 
if you want to call it, with IBM in Houston. Well, my

07:59.551 --> 08:06.142
second son lived and still lives in Houston, and 
he'll always be there. He's a psychiatrist. Oh,

08:08.626 --> 08:09.167
really? He is.

08:13.540 --> 08:17.806
She thought that the fact that her brother was 
there would make it easier for her. In fact, they

08:17.846 --> 08:22.092
found an apartment in the same complex where he was 
living. But naturally, he was going out all the

08:22.693 --> 08:25.838
time. And they had absolutely no social life. She 
didn't know who lived next door. Houston is a

08:32.287 --> 08:34.129
tremendously big city. It's very big. Much too big 
for me. It's much too big for most people. So we went

08:39.477 --> 08:50.368
to spend Thanksgiving with them and Renata, my 
husband, came home and said, now I'm really,

08:39.477 --> 08:50.368
really broken hearted to see the way our daughter 
lives. Her home is very well kept and a very nice

08:51.049 --> 08:55.393
apartment. Everything was perfect. But she had 
nothing to do except wait for Bob to come home in the

08:57.755 --> 09:05.263
evening, eat, and go to bed. And that was it. Monday 
through Friday. No hail, which she was used to. So

09:14.507 --> 09:20.339
anyway, they decided they were going back into the 
Army. And she wrote to him. No, she called long

09:22.764 --> 09:24.047
distance. They were having a party. And a friend of 
mine, Hazel Skinner, answered the phone and says,

09:25.630 --> 09:32.164
Miss Skinner, what are you doing at Mother's? Oh, 
we're having a good time. Your mother's having a

09:34.341 --> 09:35.923
cocktail party. We're all having a good time. So 
they visited for a little while, and then Jesus

09:37.926 --> 09:41.531
says, Angela, it's for you. It's Maria. So I went 
and answered the phone. I said, well, hello,

09:44.135 --> 09:46.137
honey. So glad you're calling. Anything wrong? 
No, mother, nothing. There's nothing wrong. So

09:50.303 --> 09:52.526
next morning, the phone rings, and it was Jesus. 
Angela, call Maria. The reason she called you last

09:54.710 --> 09:59.196
night was because God has joined the army again. 
And she wanted to tell you, but she knew that You

10:02.367 --> 10:06.052
would be upset by it, so she didn't want to tell you 
that. So, because I had already told them that it

10:06.072 --> 10:19.612
was so ridiculous for them to go get right back into 
the lion's mouth and this and the other, and they

10:06.072 --> 10:19.612
would always live like gypsies with not having a 
home. I tried to make it as dark as I possibly could.

10:26.242 --> 10:30.568
But she says, Mother, you taught me that whatever 
made Daddy happy would make you happy. So he was

10:32.000 --> 10:35.783
sent to El Paso, which was fine. We visited with 
him. And then from El Paso,

10:38.766 --> 10:47.634
he was sent to Tokyo. And she's with him in Tokyo? 
No, no, no. She's here now. They lived in Tokyo for

10:52.939 --> 10:54.640
three years. Her baby was born, her second child 
was born in Tokyo. And we visited them. Well, there

11:00.822 --> 11:06.890
was an alliance convention, national 
convention, and it was in the Orient, so we went. Of

11:06.910 --> 11:21.649
course, my main attraction was going to Tokyo to 
see her, and she was very, very upset about leaving

11:06.910 --> 11:21.649
us again, and she wrote very interesting letters 
from Tokyo. In fact, I say them all, and I told her,

11:21.882 --> 11:32.598
someday you might be able to do something, because 
she has a

11:21.882 --> 11:32.598
tremendous...

11:35.002 --> 11:39.328
I guess it's something inborn with her, in her 
riding. Well, these experiences and the travel

11:41.211 --> 11:47.781
perhaps will be good, because this will develop 
her ability to ride. Yes, I'm sure. But anyway...

11:50.519 --> 11:55.324
After the three years in Tokyo, they sent them to 
San Antonio, which was wonderful. Oh, yeah. In San

11:56.024 --> 12:00.208
Antonio, they were going to be there six months. 
And then from there, Bob went back to Vietnam. So

12:06.094 --> 12:08.856
when he went to Vietnam, he came back to Laredo. And 
they live in a house that belongs to us. Could I

12:12.920 --> 12:14.802
offer you some fruit juice or something? Oh, that 
would be very nice. Would you care for some?

12:21.434 --> 12:27.520
Mr. Bonnie Leyendecker, who was a very close 
friend of my grandfather. And so Daddy was trying

12:28.561 --> 12:31.423
to find something. So he went to Mr. Leyendecker 
and said, I don't have nothing to offer.

12:36.528 --> 12:38.070
Absolutely nothing to offer. The only thing that I 
could tell you would be that you could kind of watch

12:39.711 --> 12:48.119
over my cotton pickers. And Daddy said, all right, 
I'll do it. And when he'd come home, my grandmother

12:52.130 --> 12:57.995
was just crying. To see her own son, I mean her 
child, have to do that kind of a work just to

12:58.656 --> 13:08.245
survive. Because actually that's what he was 
trying to do, keep us from going hungry. So they

13:17.994 --> 13:19.916
would do anything. And I believe that if they would 
If they would have told him, the only thing there is

13:22.201 --> 13:28.308
for you to do is pick cotton, he would say, all 
right, I'll do it. Maybe he wouldn't have picked,

13:29.049 --> 13:46.791
but...

13:29.049 --> 13:46.791
Well, there were, in fact, I guess two, well, one 
very wealthy family that I've talked to in El Paso

13:29.049 --> 13:46.791
was never able to recover, really. And then some 
who were poorer in Mexico have done quite well. So

13:51.729 --> 13:54.772
there's been a lot of variation. But just the fact 
that people have represented every faction of the

13:54.832 --> 14:09.265
revolution, the winners and the losers, I think 
this... Well, there was one thing that, in my

13:54.832 --> 14:09.265
opinion, was a great salvation to our family. And 
that was the fact that, as I told you, both

14:09.725 --> 14:16.812
societies, the Nuevo Laredo and Laredo, lived as 
one. Daddy would come to the, well the people from

14:19.395 --> 14:26.746
this side would go to the casino and all that. And 
Daddy was everybody's friend. And by the same

14:32.395 --> 14:38.204
token he would come to dances on this side with the 
best of people. So you already had contact. Oh yes,

14:40.287 --> 14:42.250
everybody knew him. And so we didn't have anything 
But we still were who we were. And this can make

14:50.676 --> 14:52.160
quite a difference. Well, this is so important, I 
think, in Mexico, much more so than it is in the

14:52.180 --> 14:57.895
United States. Your name, who you were. It didn't 
really matter what you had. It was who you were, you

15:03.400 --> 15:05.803
know. This is true in some parts of the United 
States, too. New Orleans is a classic example. And

15:12.372 --> 15:16.157
a lot of the little towns. My mother's family 
founded a little town in southeast Missouri. And

15:22.665 --> 15:26.691
there's very definitely this who you are. But it's 
not thought of in connection with the United

15:26.731 --> 15:33.019
States. But you know, in my case, it didn't bother 
me to know that my friends, who are the best girls

15:33.421 --> 15:47.846
here, had better clothes than I did. Well, we 
couldn't afford them, and that was all there was to

15:48.327 --> 15:50.812
it. But nobody dressed to the point where you felt 
very much inferior. In other words, there was not

15:56.984 --> 16:05.395
that crazy spending that has taken us over. Well, 
if you're sure enough of your status, there's no

16:05.835 --> 16:09.861
need for this kind of display. Because I remember a 
very, very dear friend of mine, Alice, she used to

16:09.921 --> 16:21.076
sometimes come home and she would cry and say, you 
know what, I don't think Daddy loves me at all. They

16:21.696 --> 16:22.738
gave me sisters. There were three girls. 
Virginia, Esther, and Alice. And the middle one

16:27.726 --> 16:30.271
was sister. They always would stick on her sister.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.567
There are two things that I want to ask you about 
that I've been trying. I hope I can answer. Oh, I'm

16:40.168 --> 16:41.130
sure you can. The first one relates to your 
teaching. And I guess it's a little off the

16:43.834 --> 16:49.885
subject, but I know growing up myself, society 
where I was supposed to get married and stay home

16:50.000 --> 16:54.489
and keep house. And this was just the only, I was to 
go to college, but that was to be an educated

16:55.572 --> 17:01.344
mother. And I know that my parents and my husband's 
parents were both somewhat disapproving of me

17:01.404 --> 17:11.485
being what I became. Now, did you have any, with 
your career, did you face any of this? You mean the

17:16.158 --> 17:19.724
fact that you were getting married and yet having 
to keep on? Well, that you were working, that you

17:19.924 --> 17:24.932
had a career, even though you were married and had 
children. Did you have any? Did people ever accuse

17:26.715 --> 17:29.840
you of being improper? Yes, I'll tell you. I'll 
never forget one time. that a friend of mine, I had a

17:33.284 --> 17:51.169
party for somebody, and this very, very dear 
friend of mine who was also a teacher, Cecilia, and

17:33.284 --> 17:51.169
this other friend says, oh, some of my friends call 
me Angelita. Angelita's house is so pretty, her

17:51.229 --> 18:00.102
home is so pretty, but you know, it's a shame 
because of course she doesn't enjoy having to

17:51.229 --> 18:00.102
teach. And so my friend jumped at her and says, 
well, you'd be surprised how much she enjoys it.

18:07.748 --> 18:14.318
And one thing I can tell you, her children are not 
neglected in any way because of the fact that she

18:07.748 --> 18:14.318
teaches. But I've always said this. You know, when 
I got married and started teaching, they said,

18:16.761 --> 18:21.288
poor Angela. She has to keep on working. And now, 
girls get married. And they say, isn't it

18:26.896 --> 18:28.538
wonderful? She's going to keep on teaching. Yes, 
it's changed a lot. Even since, I think, even in 10

18:33.784 --> 18:36.286
or 12 years. They used to feel sorry for us, and now 
we think, isn't it wonderful? She still can teach.

18:41.792 --> 18:48.079
You know, another thing that makes it different 
here is the fact that we have helped so readily with

18:41.792 --> 18:48.079
everything. That would make it different. It 
makes it very different because you're able to

18:50.322 --> 18:54.887
leave your house. Yeah, I had a maid. who raised my 
children, we kept her for seventeen years. And if

19:01.068 --> 19:03.392
you had something else, you always had two. I 
always had two. One was absolutely dedicated to

19:04.753 --> 19:08.459
the children. Walked them to school. You remember 
that Cata used to walk you to Miss Ellis? She and

19:14.847 --> 19:19.113
Blackie and Mariangela.

19:19.854 --> 19:24.561
And she'd go pick her up because our hours didn't 
coincide. But you weren't really here under

19:25.233 --> 19:31.421
strong social pressures, not because it was an 
improper thing to do. This is interesting,

19:32.322 --> 19:37.669
because actually I experienced some of that 
earlier. What was the other question? The other

19:39.792 --> 19:43.337
question was, how did you happen to meet your 
husband?

19:46.721 --> 19:50.346
As we say in Spanish, lo conocí en un baile.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.063
Well, she knows what that means. Yeah, but you did. 
And yes, and actually I did. But of course, mother

20:00.729 --> 20:05.055
took us to the dance. Uh-huh. And your daddy came, 
and then who would I dance with? Yes, yes. Because

20:09.521 --> 20:12.725
mother was keeping an eye on me. And I think your 
daddy was chewing gum. Was he really? And my mother

20:17.312 --> 20:20.215
disapproved terribly. She says, who was that? gum 
chore that I was dancing with. Really? And, well,

20:28.678 --> 20:31.301
we started going. Daddy never knew. Oh, I couldn't 
have, nobody could come to my house and, I mean,

20:33.384 --> 20:39.851
nobody could ask me for a date. Because... When you 
were telling me about your schooling, I thought he

20:41.934 --> 20:46.139
was probably rather strict. Very, very much so. In 
fact, I think, not I think, I know he overdid it. But

20:53.337 --> 20:59.584
that was the way he believed, and I don't know, that 
we had to accept it. How did you manage then to?

21:02.267 --> 21:14.319
Well, we kept on going together for several years, 
and then when Mother died, I couldn't see him

21:02.267 --> 21:14.319
because we were in mourning, and I didn't want to go 
anyplace. And so a man of ours who came to spend some

21:15.361 --> 21:21.387
weeks, some days with us, I told her, I said, Tia 
Lolita, Renato wants to come and see me, and I don't

21:21.603 --> 21:27.388
know what to do. She said, well, you two and your 
father, well, he wants to talk to Daddy. So I told

21:30.931 --> 21:34.535
Daddy, I said, Daddy, he already knew. Renato 
wants to talk to you. He says, I have nothing to talk

21:37.457 --> 21:39.239
to him about. I said, well, Daddy, he wants to talk 
to you because he wants to ask permission to come

21:39.259 --> 21:45.605
and see me here. He says, well, no, I don't want to 
talk to him. I said, all right, then I have to. I'd

21:50.459 --> 21:51.981
have to see him on the corner. That was the first 
time that I ever said anything that I knew would

21:53.844 --> 22:01.334
kind of be disrespectful. And so that evening he 
came home, and he didn't tell me. He told Tia Lolita

22:08.024 --> 22:13.271
to tell me, to tell Renato that it was all right. He 
could come see me twice a week. So you became

22:17.290 --> 22:18.992
novios. Yeah, yeah. We already were novios. But 
this was official? Yes. And then Daddy went to work

22:25.482 --> 22:27.505
in Mexico. Business got bad and he went to the state 
of Guerrero. He was a very close friend of the

22:33.474 --> 22:38.120
governor of Guerrero at that time. And I remember 
so distinctly that I had gone to school in the

22:39.142 --> 22:44.850
evening. to the Escuela Amarilla Central School 
because I was taking one of those extension

22:45.067 --> 22:51.635
courses. And Renato met me on the way, and he gave me 
a letter. He said, I want you to read this. He had

22:59.745 --> 23:04.992
written Daddy asking me for my hand. And so Daddy 
wrote me and asked me, I mean, did I love him enough

23:07.195 --> 23:14.584
to want to marry him? And of course, I said, yes. He 
came over for the wedding. And then we went on a

23:20.274 --> 23:22.678
short honeymoon to Monterey. And Daddy was so 
jealous. I remember when I was getting dressed, a

23:24.620 --> 23:31.791
lady friend of ours says, doesn't she look pretty 
in her wedding gown? And Daddy says, I liked her

23:32.713 --> 23:39.142
better without

23:32.713 --> 23:39.142
it. Did he really? What year was it that you 
married? We were married in... In 1934. What sort

23:46.063 --> 23:49.667
of work was your father doing in Guerrero? I don't 
know. He was working with the government.

23:56.815 --> 23:58.476
It was government work. This would have been right 
before. This would have been during, oh my

24:00.779 --> 24:06.846
goodness, he was president before Lázaro 
Cárdenas. It would have been right before Lázaro

24:07.687 --> 24:10.610
Cárdenas. I don't know. My husband could tell you, 
but I couldn't. I can't remember his name either.

24:16.034 --> 24:18.858
So anyway, Daddy was going back to Guerrero. So he 
sent a wire to the hotel where we were staying. Was

24:22.602 --> 24:25.586
this Guerrero-Tamalipas or Guerrero-Guerrero? 
Instead of Guerrero. Right, okay. In

24:27.548 --> 24:28.970
Chilpancingo. Oh, mm-hmm. I've been there. And so 
Daddy sent his wire to Renato. And he was going by

24:36.720 --> 24:41.085
train, and this is the way he worded the wire. going 
through Monterey, I would like to see my daughter.

24:46.605 --> 24:49.510
My daughter? In other words, you can stay in the 
hotel.

24:57.081 --> 24:59.966
He was very, very extremely jealous. But then 
afterwards he realized that Renata was a good

25:00.166 --> 25:06.516
husband, a good provider, and a A good man. And you 
say your husband is a customs broker? Yes. He's a

25:13.806 --> 25:18.635
forwarding agent.

25:18.655 --> 25:19.677
Well, let's see. One more question. How do you feel 
about the revolution now, looking at it? Do you

25:24.926 --> 25:27.511
think it has been a good thing for Mexico or bad? Or 
what? Oh, it definitely has been a good thing for

25:28.874 --> 25:31.238
Mexico. I think revolutions, well-meant 
revolutions, are always for the best. And even

25:42.386 --> 25:56.483
though Don Porfirio Diaz was such a wonderful man 
and everything else, he did keep the people of

25:42.386 --> 25:56.483
Mexico in a tremendous ignorance. It was very 
hard. He didn't do it because he didn't want them to

25:59.616 --> 26:09.248
be educated, but it was too much of a, too big a 
project. And the difference in classes in those

26:10.971 --> 26:18.420
years I imagine must have been tremendous. Do you 
feel like this has, as far as classes are

26:19.902 --> 26:26.211
concerned, that Mexico has changed? I think so. I 
think so. Servants used to be, if not mistreated,

26:30.778 --> 26:37.046
in some cases, yes, they were. But they were looked 
upon as, she's just my servant. Now you don't dare

26:43.676 --> 26:47.922
do it, because if you do, you'll be without one. 
Yeah. And they have the right, in other words, now

26:49.079 --> 26:53.125
they can speak. But it's still so much more 
evident. The class system is so much more evident

26:55.649 --> 27:01.678
in Mexico than here.

27:04.061 --> 27:06.144
At least I've found it so. You haven't been in 
Mexico. I've been in Mexico enough to see a great,

27:10.491 --> 27:15.238
great difference between the way people act and 
say the way they would act in another part of the

27:16.670 --> 27:28.546
United States, I find it very, very evident. I 
really do. Just look at the other side, all of them.

27:34.314 --> 27:40.342
It's... Well, they live the way they live because 
they have a means of it.

27:45.168 --> 27:46.390
Yes, but still... The means doesn't always give 
you the right to look down. I don't think you can

27:52.673 --> 27:55.015
look down anymore. Maybe not consciously put. Not 
Luisa. All right, maybe not the Luisa foot. I still

28:06.006 --> 28:07.047
find it. I mean, I still notice it. Hello? Dr. 
Nolan, this is my husband. How do you do? How do you

28:13.973 --> 28:14.554
do? That's so nice to meet you. This is her 
daughter, Mary Catherine. Hello there. Hi. How

28:22.508 --> 28:22.949
are you doing? Where are you going? She's going to 
Rio. Good day. Good night. Oh, I'm keeping you.

28:28.818 --> 28:31.582
Better get on down the road. This has been... What 
do you think of the revolution, Mr. Zapata? Oh, the

28:38.292 --> 28:43.039
revolution has brought tremendous progress for 
Mexico. You compare Mexico today with Mexico 40

28:43.930 --> 28:52.020
years ago, there's a tremendous difference. You 
see, for instance, the city of Mexico City, you

28:53.662 --> 29:00.771
know, when Porfirio Diaz left, the population was 
300,000 people. No, no, but let's say about

29:02.253 --> 29:03.494
500,000. The population now is about 11 million. 
Monterey, the population of Monterey was 70,000.

29:12.481 --> 29:16.471
Now it's close to a million and a half. The 
population of Mexico as a whole was 13 million. Now

29:21.143 --> 29:22.948
it's 55 million people. Well, but that's not due 
to... Well, it's the province, you know. That's

29:29.191 --> 29:31.093
due to something else. No, no, no. It is a 
tremendous province, not only... All right,

29:32.294 --> 29:37.359
well, better medical care. Economically. But 
Senior Doug told a joke last night. He's very, very

29:42.304 --> 29:49.771
quiet, but nevertheless, we're leaving the 
Cardinals. We went to a cocktail of the Cardinals,

29:50.111 --> 29:52.834
the consulate, American Council had, and 
somebody made a joke about so many children, very

29:53.928 --> 30:02.396
good Catholics. He says, well, no, there was the 
one that they asked him, how many children do you

30:02.416 --> 30:07.481
have? Well, we have seven. You must be Catholics. 
No, we're Baptists. So what was the answer? Well,

30:17.191 --> 30:20.374
you must be very Catholic. Passionate baptism.

30:26.275 --> 30:31.180
That's an interesting way of putting it. Well, 
I've noticed the changes. I was first in Mexico in

30:33.282 --> 30:35.144
1955. I lived in Mexico City for seven weeks. I met 
my husband on that student trip to learn Spanish.

30:43.332 --> 30:47.597
Didn't learn much Spanish, but I did get a husband 
out of it. Oh, yeah, eventually, two years later.

30:50.932 --> 30:55.278
And we've been going back ever since. And we've 
actually, well, we lived in Monterey three

30:55.358 --> 31:05.873
months, one summer, and in Urapan three months, 
two summers ago, and have traveled over fairly

30:55.358 --> 31:05.873
long periods of time. So we've been watching the 
changes. That's a very interesting

31:07.635 --> 31:20.753
incident about, not incident, but during the time 
that right after , she had lived in, It's Uruapan.

31:22.899 --> 31:23.419
Uruapan. Uruapan. Uruapan. Uruapan. And so 
there's Uruapan and what is the name of the...

31:26.744 --> 31:31.631
Well, Zakan was the little name. Zakan. Zakan. But 
she says that most of the... About what percentage

31:33.273 --> 31:38.099
of the population doesn't speak Spanish? Oh. 
Well, the one where they don't speak Spanish is

31:40.242 --> 31:44.007
Angahuan. And I would say probably about... Oh, a 
third to half of them don't speak Spanish. This is

31:51.217 --> 31:52.659
predominantly the women. But then 30 years ago, 
hardly anyone spoke Spanish. And still, Tarasco.

31:59.349 --> 32:00.591
Tarasco. Tarasco Indians. Do you know the history 
of the Tarasco Indians? Yeah, some.

32:09.564 --> 32:10.506
Vasco de Quiroga. He was the one that organized the 
Indians.

32:19.880 --> 32:23.928
He was quite a remarkable man. He's very highly 
respected in Michoacan.

32:31.482 --> 32:42.563
But her knowledge of Mexico is very, very 
interesting.

32:42.965 --> 32:48.591
Your wife got me talking about my dissertation, 
and that's dangerous. When I do that, I can't show

32:48.891 --> 32:52.314
you. That fell into the revolutionary hands, you 
know. Old Guerrero was the first one? How did that

32:58.320 --> 32:59.341
happen? Well, it just happened, you know, that the 
Collector of Customs was very close to Don

33:00.482 --> 33:09.171
Francisco Madero, who was the president, was 
assassinated. Mm-hmm. As collector of customs,

33:13.103 --> 33:28.946
you know, he organized an uprising in the old town, 
you know, fell into the hands of the

33:13.103 --> 33:28.946
revolutionaries. And he was the 
commander-in-chief of that particular group. So

33:36.637 --> 33:40.022
the federalists, you know, what they used to call 
it, They were never able to recapture the town, you

33:41.403 --> 33:46.891
know. And so through Guerrero, you know, the 
rebels, they imported everything, you know,

33:47.773 --> 33:53.822
ammunition. Oh, that's very interesting. Yes, it 
was one of their key—this was in the uprising

33:55.625 --> 34:01.193
against Huerta. Mm-hmm. Well, what about—had 
your family already left Guerrero? Well, we left

34:05.720 --> 34:08.844
for a little while, you know, about two years. We 
moved from Guerrero to Zapata. When was that? When

34:12.269 --> 34:15.113
that particular time, you know. Oh, at that 
particular time. So we went back to the old town and

34:16.655 --> 34:24.866
we stayed most of the time, you know, spent most of 
the revolution there. In Guerrero? In Guerrero.

34:27.289 --> 34:31.475
Because there were no, no, there were no battles 
there. No. It was a quiet... But it was already held

34:35.005 --> 34:37.849
by the Caranzistas. The Caranzistas, you know, 
about two or three years later, they organized an

34:38.109 --> 34:47.380
army from Nuevo Laredo. They tried to recapture 
the town, you know, but the Federales were

34:47.420 --> 34:52.126
defeated. And later on, you know, the rebels, they 
captured Nuevo Laredo. No regular particular

35:00.293 --> 35:01.715
time. It was a small, very small population. It was 
probably about 13,000.

35:11.648 --> 35:17.416
Well, you can judge the progress of Mexico, you 
know, by just looking at the size of the cities. And

35:18.538 --> 35:19.539
a lot of other things. Don't you believe also that a 
lot of the people who live in the country, so to

35:19.559 --> 35:29.693
speak, I mean in places where, remote places, were 
not accounted for? Oh, you mean before? I mean in

35:34.552 --> 35:35.735
taking census. Earlier? Yes. This is entirely 
possible. But there has been... They don't have

35:41.350 --> 35:44.458
any means to know exactly. You can see the progress 
too in the villages where people have electricity

35:45.215 --> 36:07.494
and they have used it to establish, you know, 
crafts of course are lovely but they have now small

35:45.215 --> 36:07.494
local industries that bring in more return and you 
can see it in housing and in sanitation and all

35:45.215 --> 36:07.494
kinds of other things all through many of the 
villages. Highways, you know. And in this

36:10.342 --> 36:12.746
education. This is the thing that impresses me 
most, is the knowledge that children and

36:12.786 --> 36:31.219
grandchildren of people who not only were peasant 
farmers, but who were linguistic Indians, are now

36:12.786 --> 36:31.219
university graduates. are well established in 
the Mexican middle class. From one little town of a

36:35.059 --> 36:43.329
thousand people, there have, in 28 years, that 
town has produced 88 professionals. Every one of

36:44.350 --> 36:48.976
whom had to leave town for further education at the 
end of the sixth grade. Which, you know, there are a

36:50.217 --> 36:54.903
lot of towns in Texas that don't have that record, I 
don't think. You know, for the time, probably

36:55.704 --> 36:59.248
already was published in the Reader's Digest, a 
very interesting article about education in

37:00.089 --> 37:05.923
Mexico. Probably you will remember that they 
mentioned the fact that they were building a

37:06.224 --> 37:13.823
school a day in Mexico. I believe that. They're 
doing a lot. There's still a lot to be done, but

37:19.107 --> 37:22.331
they're making quite an effort. And it's not just 
the government can't do it all. The one town has

37:25.494 --> 37:30.801
done it even with only six years of school. The 
Indian town, that is the ones who are

37:31.402 --> 37:39.992
psychologically Indian, they have the schools, 
but they won't send their children. So you can't,

37:40.413 --> 37:45.739
you know, education for two, to achieve when it's 
available, apparently, from the towns I've

37:46.040 --> 37:52.967
studied, it has to come from inside you. It's one 
thing for the opportunity to be there, but you have

37:53.027 --> 38:01.054
to be willing to take it and to desire to take it. At 
least this is what I found in these little towns

38:01.235 --> 38:05.219
that I was studying. And they varied in that some 
towns were not only willing to, but eager to, and

38:05.299 --> 38:15.068
succeeded in not actually accomplishing a great 
deal. And others just either rejected the

38:18.379 --> 38:22.525
opportunity or ignored it. Or, well, there were 
both. There was just not paying much attention to

38:27.012 --> 38:29.115
it. And there were some pounds like this. And then 
there was the one pound that actually rejected

38:31.959 --> 38:40.752
opportunity because it came from a larger society 
that they resumed. So there's a lot of choice

38:41.069 --> 38:46.600
involved with those people in town. Well, I have 
one more question for you. When did you happen to

38:49.285 --> 38:51.369
come to Laredo? Well, I came to Laredo, let us say, 
about

38:52.671 --> 39:00.726
1922. 1922. Always. Why? Well, I came to Nuevo 
Laredo first, and then I moved to Laredo, Texas. In

39:10.218 --> 39:15.345
those days, you know, there were no immigration 
requirements. All you had to do is cross the

39:15.365 --> 39:18.669
border. So it really didn't make much difference. 
Now I started myself here in Laredo.

39:32.606 --> 39:33.908
I've been here quite a time. She's from Nuevo 
Laredo, too. Yeah, now she knows. She was not a

39:40.880 --> 39:45.005
refugee, she was exiled. Well, that's true, 
really, in this particular case. They exiled

39:49.171 --> 39:51.253
themselves. They were self-exiled.

39:57.541 --> 40:04.350
Most of the people, the revolution that came to the 
United States, it was the best kind of people in

39:57.541 --> 40:04.350
Mexico. The wealthy people, the poor people, they 
didn't have to move. Some did. Some did. Yes.

40:12.366 --> 40:15.836
Mostly just to get away from the turmoil. Yes. 
let's say, exiled people were the best kind of

40:17.206 --> 40:22.031
people, you know. The ones that fled during the 
early stages, the refugees from the Madero and

40:22.051 --> 40:34.362
then the first stages of the Karenciste 
revolution were definitely this group. And it was

40:34.543 --> 40:40.909
what I found is that the poorer people tended to 
come later. And they were reacting to just the

40:41.069 --> 40:45.593
years and years and years of warfare. Or many 
Villistas, you know, a price was put on the head of a

40:45.860 --> 40:51.528
lot of the men who had fought with Villa. And so 
there are a lot of people who had fought with the

40:52.269 --> 41:02.663
Villa armies and that fled, say, by 1916 or 1917 to 
escape Carranza's government. So there was that

41:03.444 --> 41:05.046
too. Carranza is considered one of the, he is the 
creator of the New Mexico. Monero, you know, he

41:14.193 --> 41:19.239
belonged to one of the wealthiest families in, 
well, I think you're familiar with. So he honestly

41:20.180 --> 41:28.109
believed, you know, that changing the president 
of Mexico, everything was to be changed. But

41:28.129 --> 41:33.395
unfortunately, he didn't make any changes. He 
changed the figures of the personalities of the

41:34.897 --> 41:42.546
government, but made no social changes. Carranza 
is the one that changed, created the new

41:43.538 --> 41:49.276
constitution, 1917 constitution. So it's 
considered one of the main

41:59.468 --> 42:03.373
person, you know, in the creation of the New 
Mexico. You know, I saw the table where the

42:03.393 --> 42:09.640
constitution, the new constitution was signed. 
No, it was not. It was not a new constitution. What

42:13.825 --> 42:14.326
was it? It was a table, a very rustic table, you 
know. When the plan of Guadalupe was signed. Oh,

42:22.816 --> 42:24.779
beyond the end of Guadalupe. All right, that I see 
now belonged to an uncle of mine. Oh, it did? And he

42:29.422 --> 42:33.406
had that table there, and that's where they all 
met, Puebla and Saltillo. And here's Saltillo.

42:34.147 --> 42:34.928
Yes, I've been there. It's a fascinating place. 
And the table had the names. What was his name? Your

42:43.077 --> 42:45.580
uncle's name? Oscar Garza, but her name was 
Angela, last name. You were named after? Amaya.

42:54.369 --> 42:59.395
You know Carranza, that particular time, he was 
the governor of the state of Puebla. And when

42:59.982 --> 43:12.878
Madero was assassinated, he assumed, you know, 
the command of the revolution against Huerta. And

43:12.978 --> 43:18.384
he was appointed the commander in chief. He was not 
general, you know. the government state. As some

43:24.434 --> 43:37.512
people have analyzed it since, there was some 
feeling that a military man shouldn't become

43:24.434 --> 43:37.512
president, and that's why Carranza called 
himself first chief, so that he would be eligible

43:24.434 --> 43:37.512
to be. This is what one historian I've read has 
suggested as a possibility for his party. Well, he

43:44.542 --> 43:48.688
was his civilian, you know. He maintained his 
civilian status.

43:53.999 --> 43:55.621
Carranza was very interesting. One of my 
favorites, well, I've always liked Obregón. No.

44:00.067 --> 44:00.267
No? You don't like Obregón? Why not? Oh, he was very 
mean, you know. Was he really? Yeah. In your

44:08.457 --> 44:09.619
opinion. Not in my opinion, you know. He 
assassinated most of his friends, you know. He had

44:13.624 --> 44:16.708
no heart whatsoever.

44:19.351 --> 44:23.837
You know, so that you can have an idea, you know, 
Obregón, was one of the signers, you know, on the

44:25.302 --> 44:31.389
Constitution, because in Mexico there must be no 
re-election. President's elected for six years,

44:31.409 --> 44:33.992
and that's the end of it. And he was so ambitious 
that he changed the Constitution. Yes, yes. He

44:40.819 --> 44:42.201
used to be re-elected. That's the reason he was 
killed. Yeah, he didn't survive it, did he? It was a

44:47.727 --> 44:48.688
bad choice. What do you think of Lázaro Cárdenas? 
Well, Lázaro Cárdenas was very... He was a good

44:55.998 --> 44:59.223
president, nationalistic president.

45:01.947 --> 45:04.591
Oh, you know, he's a folk hero in Michoacán. Oh, 
they love him there. Oh, my goodness. They call it a

45:08.537 --> 45:10.119
pita, pata. Yeah, he's... He had a very good 
president, some very progressive. Cayus

45:16.989 --> 45:20.014
Putarco, yes, Cayus was a very good president. 
Then why do we have now? It's a matter of opinion,

45:23.708 --> 45:28.364
you know. He's trying to change everything. At the 
same time, you know, there's a turmoil.
