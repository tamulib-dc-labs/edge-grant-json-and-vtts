WEBVTT

00:01.853 --> 00:07.461
In 1997, we were in Bandon, Oregon. And would you 
please tell me your full name, rank, and serial

00:08.342 --> 00:12.648
number? Okay, my name is Lloyd G. Lyman, Jr. I was 
born May 16, 1923. Where?

00:25.266 --> 00:26.207
In Medford, Oregon. And your family, father, what 
were they doing? My father was a bull of the woods.

00:33.927 --> 00:43.839
He was a logging superintendent for the 
California Fruit Growers Exchange, which is the

00:33.927 --> 00:43.839
Sunkist Orange. They made boxes for Sunkist 
Orange. Is that right? That was the excuse they had

00:47.764 --> 00:52.389
for getting into the lumber business. And did you 
have brothers and sisters? I had one sister who was

00:54.171 --> 00:57.595
three years younger than I had. She lives in 
Ashland today. And did you spend your young life in

01:01.275 --> 01:04.199
Medford? I grew up in Medford, yes. I never left 
home until I was left to go to college. And where did

01:11.007 --> 01:12.189
you go to college? I went to Reed College in 
Portland. R-E-E-I-D. No, double E. R-E-E-D,

01:14.932 --> 01:20.199
okay. How did you get to Reed College? On a 
scholarship. Is that a presidential?

01:25.205 --> 01:26.687
Non-denominational, yeah. It's like... It's a 
good school. It's similar to Swarthmore, or to the

01:29.000 --> 01:38.821
little Ivy League schools, or something like 
that. It's a good school. What is it, about 1,200,

01:40.545 --> 01:42.589
1,400, 1,500, or more? I think it's about 1,200 
now, but when I went there, it was less than... 500.

01:49.566 --> 01:51.048
Oh, is that right? Yeah, the entering classes were 
limited to 100, and they never graduated more than

01:51.128 --> 01:56.897
about 70. So, but that all changed with World War 
II, because for one thing, people like myself, it

01:57.858 --> 02:08.134
took me eight years to get through school. When did 
you start? 1940. Okay, you entered the class in

02:10.947 --> 02:14.695
1940, and then what happened? Then, three years 
into that, I went into the Navy, and I was in the Navy

02:14.716 --> 02:22.012
for a couple of years. You enlisted, drafted, all 
of your bombs. I was a 90-day wonder. Oh, is that

02:29.273 --> 02:30.334
right? Yeah. I started out as a naval aviation 
cadet, got washed out, and got a commission as a

02:30.715 --> 02:39.267
deck officer. Did you go to sea? I went to, I spent 
about a year and a half in the Pacific, at the end of

02:41.210 --> 02:47.478
the war in the South Pacific, on a landing craft. I 
was a landing boat officer on the A.K.A. 71. Okay.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.133
I tell you, Of course, I came along a bit later, but 
you know, he said, for assignment I wanted sea duty

02:59.058 --> 03:08.011
in the Pacific. I got shore duty in the Atlantic. I 
really did. I really wanted to destroy it. Oh, what

03:12.978 --> 03:14.721
a great life that would have been. Well, I tried to, 
I think I saved my life by getting washed out of the

03:21.670 --> 03:23.892
Naval Aviation, I couldn't land to a spot. If I was 
in the Air Force, I could have been okay, because

03:24.893 --> 03:31.420
they come in and they don't stall out over us. I was 
stationed in Jacksonville Naval Air Station.

03:34.903 --> 03:37.706
Those guys are insane. They drink all night and

03:38.006 --> 03:43.712
cry all day. So you're in service, you go to, you're 
in Tokyo, in Japan. We were in the first, at the end

03:48.076 --> 03:51.660
of the war, we were in Subic Bay, practicing to land 
in Japan, to attack Japan when the war ended. So we

03:58.334 --> 03:59.659
were all loaded up. And we were the first task force 
into Japan when the war ended. And we were in Japan

04:04.880 --> 04:09.888
the day that MacArthur was on the Missouri. We went 
to sail right past the stern of the Iowa that he was

04:10.068 --> 04:15.838
on. I forget the name of the battleship. Missouri. 
It was the Missouri, yes. Yeah, it was the

04:20.886 --> 04:22.328
Missouri. And I remember seeing that peglated 
little Japanese guy that surrendered. It was one

04:27.996 --> 04:30.879
of the officers that surrendered. He only had one 
leg. And we went right, our ship went right up past

04:32.821 --> 04:40.248
the stern during all these ceremonies. That's 
memorable. Yeah, that was memorable. And then how

04:43.832 --> 04:46.034
long did you stay in Japan? Well, after that we took 
Japanese troops that were in Manchuria back to

04:46.054 --> 04:54.182
Japan. evacuated them. On American ships? Yes, on 
the A.K.A.s. A.K.A. is the Cargo Attack. And then

05:03.805 --> 05:14.200
we took Chinese nationalist troops out of Hong 
Kong to North China to feed them to the communists.

05:15.162 --> 05:17.585
We unloaded. We made about five or six trips to 
places like Tsingtao

05:25.786 --> 05:31.493
Tsing-Wang-Tao, and a whole bunch of northern 
ports. You don't think about that? That would have

05:34.336 --> 05:39.141
been part of the end of the war? Well, no, they were 
fighting. This was when the communists were

05:40.483 --> 05:43.686
coming out of it. Oh, okay. That war had already 
started. Yes, they were headed for trouble.

05:51.275 --> 05:54.679
Anyhow, that's when we came home. And so you got out 
of service in Muscovado, where you probably went.

06:02.773 --> 06:16.617
Well, it must have been 1946,

06:02.773 --> 06:16.617
and then I went back to Reed, and another year and a 
half was all done. to graduate school. What'd you

06:18.093 --> 06:18.954
finish in? American history.

06:27.384 --> 06:31.168
I went to graduate school at Berkeley. I was in 
history there. And after I got a master's degree,

06:35.593 --> 06:45.344
and in the process of doing that, I knew I didn't 
want to become a teacher. This guy that I got my

06:48.220 --> 07:03.338
master's with was, he kept asking me what I was 
going to do, because I told him I didn't want to be a

06:48.220 --> 07:03.338
teacher, and he told me that the library school was 
looking for men. So I went to the library school,

07:03.358 --> 07:12.169
and I got a library degree in 1950.

07:14.326 --> 07:19.991
And then I went to work at Caltech, and I was the 
assistant librarian there for a couple of years. I

07:20.012 --> 07:22.494
was there for five years. And the library school 
started a doctoral program, and I was invited to

07:22.514 --> 07:31.423
come back to participate in that. And they gave me 
a, I was a teaching fellow or something at that sort

07:33.765 --> 07:40.131
of library school. really bored, I decided I 
didn't want to do it. For one thing, I didn't

07:43.905 --> 07:46.910
believe in a doctorate for librarians. That was a 
waste of time. So, one of the instructors in the

07:49.736 --> 07:59.914
library school was the ex-wife of the director of 
the University of California Press. And she told

08:00.855 --> 08:05.123
me that they were looking for people And I went down 
and talked to the director, and he hired me, and I

08:05.710 --> 08:14.961
was the assistant to the director.

08:14.981 --> 08:16.102
And the director was? August Peruget. F-R-U-G-E 
with an accent over the E. And tell me something

08:18.685 --> 08:25.933
about the University of California Press. Okay. 
It was founded, I believe, in 1893, and And it would

08:34.145 --> 08:36.267
have been one of the earliest? It was among the 
earliest, yes, along with Chicago, Johns

08:36.527 --> 08:41.973
Hopkins, and Columbia. So it could have been one of 
the first public universities. It may have been

08:46.577 --> 08:50.261
the first public. I think that's right. That's 
interesting. Yeah. Chicago is the oldest.

08:53.284 --> 08:53.964
Oldest, yeah. It's a couple of years older. Well, 
Chicago was founded in 1893. Well,

09:02.309 --> 09:23.558
maybe I've got Cal five years too soon, but I know 
that Cal was started before the turn of the

09:02.309 --> 09:23.558
century, and I know Chicago is the oldest 
university press in the United States. and

09:24.179 --> 09:30.109
Thorstein Bedman, and Bedman went to teach at 
Chicago in 93 when it opened, I believe is correct.

09:30.129 --> 09:33.074
I think that's correct. I'll have to check that. 
Anyway, okay. So, and what kind of format or what

09:35.078 --> 09:40.146
was the California Press doing? Anything in terms 
of characterizing it? Well, this was, I went there

09:42.110 --> 09:45.175
in 1956. And this was a big time for university 
presses. There was this legislation that federal

09:50.686 --> 10:00.157
money was going into libraries to support book 
purchases. And university presses were

10:00.918 --> 10:04.823
expanding at a ferocious rate. This was a great 
decade. The 50s into the 60s was a great time for

10:08.267 --> 10:14.875
university presses.

10:15.445 --> 10:24.814
Among other things, I think that the University of 
Texas was founded in this period.

10:24.874 --> 10:31.620
And many other universities began their 
publishing programs in this period. For South

10:31.640 --> 10:33.422
Carolina and Texas also. Yes. I think South 
Carolina was already established by then. LSU was

10:37.145 --> 10:37.766
older. LSU was 20s or 30s. Do you know? It's 
possible. We'll come back to that in a minute. But

10:41.810 --> 10:42.390
anyway. I think we can look for some of that stuff. 
So this was good. That's a way to mention that. This

10:50.388 --> 10:54.134
was a good time for the university press expansion 
and so forth. And there were a great number of

10:54.235 --> 11:02.870
people my age who were recruited at this time. Most 
of us had no previous publishing experience. We

11:08.359 --> 11:10.022
learned on the job. And that's what I got. I started 
out as assistant to the director and I became an

11:14.496 --> 11:19.963
assistant director. And I had, I got to do 
everything. For a while I was a copy editor. I did

11:27.633 --> 11:31.619
everything but the actual direct sale and 
selling. I never hit the bookstore. But I ended up

11:34.623 --> 11:41.612
being responsible for, as assistant director, I 
was responsible for all the activities except the

11:42.419 --> 11:44.141
editing. But I was also an editor. They had what 
they called sponsoring editors in California.

11:49.628 --> 11:55.496
And these people were responsible for certain 
areas, subject areas. And I had the local history

11:56.397 --> 12:00.061
mostly. I had the stuff, most of the stuff I had was 
what no one else wanted. California had a big list.

12:05.208 --> 12:11.616
California became one of the top two or three in 
terms of quantity. Chicago has always been the

12:12.153 --> 12:14.536
first. And

12:14.917 --> 12:22.026
Harvard, Cal were next.

12:26.332 --> 12:29.816
Columbia, Princeton, Yale. Hopkins wasn't very 
big, but it became big, and it is now. It's a lot

12:35.243 --> 12:39.629
bigger

12:35.243 --> 12:39.629
now. And how long were you in California? 16 years. 
Is that right? Yes. So you left... In the 70s, in the

12:46.155 --> 12:50.763
72 or something like that. Why? Well... And you 
went to LSU? More or less, yeah. Okay, well, okay,

12:56.193 --> 12:57.736
hold on, okay. For personal reasons, let's leave 
that. I'll tell you after Trinity. All right. And

13:04.427 --> 13:05.068
then... In 1970... four, three or four, I went to 
LSU. And I was the executive editor and the sales

13:12.122 --> 13:18.669
and promotion manager. Under? Under Les Filabal. 
Charles East had already resigned, and Dick

13:22.193 --> 13:29.882
Wentworth had already gone to Illinois. Philomon 
is P-H-I-L-L-I-V-A-U-N? That's close. We can

13:36.001 --> 13:36.823
check this. I have an AAUP

13:36.903 --> 13:41.390
directory. Yeah, I can really get addicted to all 
of them. I like these. Turn it off a minute, and I'll

13:44.475 --> 13:48.601
get to that directly. So you go to LSU about 73, and 
you're a... I was assistant editor, associate

13:54.989 --> 13:58.052
director. I was executive editor. Executive 
editor. And sales and promotion manager. Sales

14:05.299 --> 14:07.962
and promotion. I got it. And what's going on at LSU? 
Well, at this time, LSU was growing, was going

14:10.964 --> 14:17.871
fast. And they had the... The old style series. 
Yeah, but what's that book called? Something of

14:24.588 --> 14:25.489
fools. Ship of fools. No, not the ship, the other 
one. Yeah.

14:32.117 --> 14:33.438
OK, let's turn it back on. OK, so LSU's leading book 
right at the moment was The Confederacy of Dunces.

14:39.125 --> 14:41.607
And were you there when that book was published? 
Yes. Well, we were negotiating when I was there.

14:48.495 --> 14:52.079
But I think it got published later, in 1980 or 
something like that. Or it got the prize in 1980. So

14:54.862 --> 14:57.185
those were good years for LSU. LSU had good years, 
50s, 60s, 70s, and maybe still is. And the Old South

15:01.910 --> 15:05.333
series was really classy. Yes.

15:09.458 --> 15:22.692
I think under Philip Baum's direction, the press 
has flourished, and it's continued as far as I

15:09.458 --> 15:22.692
know.

15:23.110 --> 15:27.615
You're at LSU now, 73 until when? I was there about a 
year and a half. And I believe it was 1974 that Frank

15:29.917 --> 15:43.892
Gordloff approached me about coming to A&M to be 
his successor.

15:44.793 --> 15:46.795
Can you tell me a little bit about that approach? He 
and I attended one of the national meetings And I

15:53.367 --> 15:55.910
believe this was one that was at Yale. I think 
that's what it was. And during that meeting, he

15:59.254 --> 16:15.094
backed me into a corner and told me that he would 
like me to apply for the job of associate director

15:59.254 --> 16:15.094
at A&M with the idea of becoming his successor. He 
was planning to retire in a couple of years. OK. Why

16:21.442 --> 16:22.463
you? He was a very good friend of August Truget's, 
and I, although I never can prove this, I suspect

16:22.966 --> 16:41.937
that he had some conversation at some point with 
August Truget about finding a successor, and

16:22.966 --> 16:41.937
August must have recommended me.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.065
He came highly recommended. I got some very good 
recommendations from both August Pruget and the

16:48.920 --> 17:00.655
other assistant director at Cal, Bill Lilley, who 
was a demon editor. He was terrific as a painter.

17:02.978 --> 17:11.048
But those two both gave me... And let's see, so what 
do you think about this approach? Are you

17:11.188 --> 17:12.430
receptive? You can't really say no. Well, you 
can't say no to Frank Wardlaw under any

17:14.969 --> 17:19.534
circumstances. And shortly after that, I... And 
Phil Vaughan was... In fact, I still have...

17:27.864 --> 17:31.248
Because Frank had written him first. Yes, yes, I 
think that's right. I didn't know that. Yeah, I

17:34.211 --> 17:34.892
did. I did. You've got the documents, yeah. 
Anyway, then we... Leigh and I went to College

17:42.937 --> 17:51.805
Station, which neither of us had the faintest, 
really, idea of where College Station was. The

17:51.905 --> 18:03.936
only thing I knew about College Station was that 
that's where John Kimbrough came from for the

17:51.905 --> 18:03.936
national championship football team sometime 
before. But I had no idea where it was, where

18:03.956 --> 18:07.579
College Station was. I had a vague idea of where 
Austin was, but I'd never been to Texas, ever. And

18:13.396 --> 18:21.787
I'm sure it would have seemed more unusual if we 
hadn't spent close to two years in Louisiana.

18:22.168 --> 18:22.388
Yeah. Because that was our first experience with 
any southwest, southern, whatever. Yeah, that's

18:27.936 --> 18:29.798
a different world. Both of them are different. Oh, 
yes. I'd probably stay in a really different place

18:31.781 --> 18:34.605
than South Louisiana. Oh, yeah. Because we know we 
went there from Lafayette. Yeah. Still getting

18:37.989 --> 18:39.792
adjusted. No. Of course, Lafayette's a totally 
different place. Oh, yes. Okay, so you came to

18:43.619 --> 18:49.447
College Station, and what happened when you got 
there? This is your exploratory. Had you already

18:50.868 --> 18:51.870
accepted? We'd accepted. We came over and were 
interviewed again by Frank and Jack Williams. We

19:04.346 --> 19:11.415
were formally offered the job, and we accepted. 
What was Williams' role in that positive reviews?

19:16.892 --> 19:17.372
I believe... He was watching and listening and 
supporting? Yes, I believe that it would have been

19:19.555 --> 19:27.123
impossible to have gotten the job unless he 
concurred. I think that he was very interested in

19:27.604 --> 19:31.187
the press. Yeah, that's what, you know, Joe 
Morris, I was reading one of them, and that was one

19:31.207 --> 19:41.959
of the most impressive things with him, is when he 
wasn't praying so much, but Williams' great

19:31.207 --> 19:41.959
interest, that really reassured me. Well, I doubt 
that it could have happened, that Frank could have

19:42.158 --> 19:50.866
even gone there without William's interest and 
strong support. And he did, I don't know whether we

19:50.886 --> 20:10.765
should also mention the fact that several times 
during the time that I was there, at the end of

19:50.886 --> 20:10.765
William's career there, he diverted some 
donations that came to his office, small amounts

19:50.886 --> 20:10.765
of money, like $10,000, $15,000, and handed them 
to the press. Let's reiterate that and make it

20:13.775 --> 20:17.218
clear. So any immediate impression of any of the 
press situation at that time? That's a good

20:24.765 --> 20:26.346
question. Sometimes you get interesting 
answers. I've got something I'll show you. I wrote

20:32.652 --> 20:39.418
back to one of the people, one of the assistants. 
administrative assistant at LSU, my impression

20:40.073 --> 20:46.601
of Texas.

20:49.304 --> 20:57.674
But it was, it was a total, it was completely 
outside my experience, and it certainly was

20:49.304 --> 20:57.674
outside Leah's experience. She had never been 
exposed to this kind of like world at all. One of the

21:07.286 --> 21:09.388
things that impressed me And I remember the very 
first was the extreme, I guess you'd call it,

21:09.655 --> 21:16.845
formality. All the, all the, you could identify 
all the faculty members, I thought, because they

21:16.866 --> 21:23.936
all wore black suits and white ties. Did you 
remember that? Well, I certainly, that was, you

21:27.621 --> 21:34.411
could, just every one of them, it seemed like. And 
it began to change. during the decade that I was

21:36.200 --> 21:39.565
there, pretty soon it wasn't, you couldn't do that 
anymore. But it seemed like... That's

21:39.605 --> 21:42.208
interesting, yeah. It was almost like a uniform, 
for heaven's sake. Yeah. No, I don't mean that. I

21:47.916 --> 21:56.448
guess I keep thinking of Lloyd Taylor in history, 
who was so different, you know, I guess. But

21:56.548 --> 21:59.853
anyway, history was a different problem the rest 
of it. That's interesting. And the other thing

22:02.637 --> 22:05.160
that the... The thing that neither of us was aware 
of was... Of course, you had been in California.

22:11.170 --> 22:12.233
Yes, yes. And A&M was in the backwater of all the 
social, cultural change. Yes. That's true.

22:18.005 --> 22:18.606
That's correct. Okay, I got you. Yeah. The other 
thing that I couldn't, that was odd, was that

22:19.708 --> 22:23.757
every... faculty member with, there was a very 
insistence on doctor. And at California, it was

22:30.236 --> 22:33.760
all Mr. or Miss or Mrs. There was never, no matter 
how many degrees a person had, they never used

22:33.980 --> 22:43.111
them, used the designation job. Yeah, Missouri 
was kind of getting in that vogue and all those

22:43.131 --> 22:49.719
things. Yeah, yeah. That's interesting. Okay. So 
you and Leah will move to College Station. Yes. Or

22:56.579 --> 22:57.760
Brian, whichever. Yes. When? In September. It had 
to be in September, probably. Yeah, I believe it

23:02.665 --> 23:03.726
was September. And it must have been 70. You 
probably started September the 1st, 1977? No. Oh,

23:11.133 --> 23:11.594
no, no. 70. 75 or something like that. I'll check up 
there. I know that. That's got to be on the record. I

23:19.902 --> 23:21.243
don't know. Yeah, it is. I keep Seventy, it must 
have been seventy-five. Yeah, it had to be. I think

23:26.585 --> 23:27.446
it was seventy-five. Yeah, because the pressed 
artists that came the first, seventy-four.

23:30.570 --> 23:32.332
That's, see that, yeah. I mean, and Frank Fedow 
wrote that nice piece. Thank goodness he wrote

23:34.856 --> 23:36.979
that in the beginning. That's with chapter one. 
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, I think that sounds more like

23:39.942 --> 23:43.667
it, Henry. I think it was seventy-five. Okay, and 
now when you came, were there any instructions

23:46.471 --> 23:53.160
or... directions or format that the Whitehall 
laid out, that here's what we're going to do? No,

24:01.121 --> 24:03.464
there wasn't anything like that. It was either he 
assumed

24:04.124 --> 24:21.562
that I was aware of what they wanted to do, or he just 
assumed or took all that under his own hat. The

24:21.802 --> 24:22.843
thing he did that I really helped a great deal. He 
took me around and introduced me to dozens of

24:26.611 --> 24:34.445
people all over the state. Businessmen, 
politicians, other faculty people, authors, and

24:43.225 --> 24:53.656
he also got me into the Texas Institute of Letters, 
which I had no reason. I mean,

24:53.716 --> 25:04.087
I think at the time that I was there, there were only 
a couple of other people in the Institute of

24:53.716 --> 25:04.087
Letters. One of them was Vandiver. Vandiver hated 
it. He had nothing to do with it. And the other was

25:07.731 --> 25:09.012
your colleague. Milton. And as far as I know, those 
are the only other ones. And Frank.

25:19.562 --> 25:22.590
Frank was . Was there anything unique or 
distinctive or peculiar you thought about?

25:29.817 --> 25:33.743
Wardlaw's relationship to the rest of the world in 
Texas. I'm not sure what question I'm asking. I

25:35.926 --> 25:40.393
think he would have been a perfectly successful 
politician. I think he had a wider acquaintance

25:40.473 --> 25:44.619
than most politicians. He told me once that one of 
the people that impressed him most in his whole

25:44.759 --> 25:53.292
life was LBJ. LBJ kind of overwhelmed him, 
frankly. came out second man in that

25:57.205 --> 26:02.751
confrontation. That's good. But he was very 
impressed by LBJ, and he had numerous encounters

26:03.031 --> 26:11.381
with him, apparently. Yeah, because that world 
seems so unique and pure and distinct, and you

26:12.201 --> 26:23.234
know, there's just a little charisma or something 
going there that's strange, and you don't see

26:12.201 --> 26:23.234
that. Frank had a knack for or people for important 
people. Important. And he just had a way.

26:33.125 --> 26:33.746
Instinct. Yeah, somehow he could get to it, and I 
don't know how the heck he did it. Oh, obviously. Do

26:38.353 --> 26:47.206
you think, what was his role as a director when you 
came, and also, I want to define your role as an

26:38.353 --> 26:47.206
associate? Well, there wasn't any question. He 
was in charge, and he was really the catalyst of

26:53.348 --> 27:13.855
establishing the reputation of

26:53.348 --> 27:13.855
getting the, he was looking for the authors, and 
directing, he raised a lot of And do you think that

27:14.088 --> 27:21.318
was, what was uppermost on his mind in terms of, was 
it funding, was he building the funding? I think

27:21.398 --> 27:36.600
funding was, yeah, because he had no, an unlimited 
amount of capital to work with, and he had no

27:21.398 --> 27:36.600
assurance of more so far as... No, no, he didn't. 
The point about this revolving funding, was that

27:36.920 --> 27:41.226
unique in the publishing business? you know, 
setting up those series with all these funds. Oh,

27:45.652 --> 27:48.075
yes, this was all in the wind. This happened over 
and over again in that period in the late 50s into

27:48.176 --> 27:56.266
the 60s into the 70s. And he had had tremendous 
experience doing this at Texas especially, not so

27:58.129 --> 28:05.098
much South Carolina. That was too early. But this 
is all, it was part of the whole of university

28:12.104 --> 28:13.486
presses everywhere. That was a characteristic of 
the university press business at that time. That

28:17.292 --> 28:19.897
was not something unique or distinctive to Frank 
Washington. No, no, no. Harvard, there's the

28:20.878 --> 28:31.696
Bancroft series in Harvard, and all sorts of odd 
things happened with the way the money came.

28:32.156 --> 28:36.323
Sometimes it was sought, and sometimes people 
just brought it in and That Bancroft thing at

28:36.556 --> 29:02.400
Harvard, somebody, I think it's Bancroft, 
anyway, some couple whose son was killed in World

28:36.556 --> 29:02.400
War II just walked in the door of Wilson's office 
and said, we'd like to make a memorial to our son who

28:36.556 --> 29:02.400
loved books.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.302
For that time, it was enormous. Now, Frank's 
solicitations were almost invariably $75,000 to

29:04.720 --> 29:13.592
the nation. Why? I don't know. I wish he had been a 
little more aggressive, because I think,

29:15.935 --> 29:28.251
considering the influence he had with some of 
these people, he could have gotten a lot more. But

29:28.892 --> 29:29.933
that was the number. Any time you saw it? Yes. 75 you 
need 75 and then 75 over there he he usually would

29:31.822 --> 29:58.082
would look at it i think his perspective was to say 
you need enough to us to do the first book or the

29:31.822 --> 29:58.082
first two books a couple of books and then depend on 
income from sales and

29:31.822 --> 29:58.082
some of these uh series it was unrealistic it would 
have been better if he'd had bigger amount that

29:58.518 --> 30:04.784
would have allowed a longer term development, a 
series of developments. Yeah, because you can

30:04.804 --> 30:08.528
send things bombs, you know, they do that. But he 
was an absolute ace at going out and getting, like

30:10.030 --> 30:17.618
you say, 75, 50,000 bucks. Now, and what is your 
primary function when you first arrived?

30:20.981 --> 30:21.341
Everything? I was in a learning mode, mostly, and I 
The difference between my experience at Cal, the

30:28.640 --> 30:43.415
biggest difference, and at Texas A&M, was that at 
Cal, it was a big organization by when it was

30:28.640 --> 30:43.415
depressed then. There were a hundred employees. I 
don't think there are that many now, but there

30:46.177 --> 30:49.220
were. It was very diffused. People had little 
compartmentalized

30:57.732 --> 31:19.943
responsibilities and the director there was more 
of a juggler more of a he was running he was handling

30:57.732 --> 31:19.943
all the sub departments whereas frank ran 
everything frank was his own production manager

30:57.732 --> 31:19.943
frank was his own acquisitions frank was his own 
salesman
