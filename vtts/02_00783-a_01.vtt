00:03.560 --> 00:10.580
This is Debra Beale and I am interviewing Dr. 
Richard Thomas on the history of the Texas

00:03.560 --> 00:10.580
Engineering Experiment Station. The date is June 
15th, 1984. ...section on here already, so tell us

00:14.560 --> 00:19.580
who you are. I'd like to

00:19.560 --> 00:26.460
put some background on your education and how you 
came down here. Well, I wouldn't say how far back in

00:26.440 --> 00:30.301
it. You talked about university education in 
Richmond. I did all my work up at Ohio State,

00:33.660 --> 00:43.940
finished, or left there rather, in 64. My

00:43.920 --> 01:01.070
background is basically aerospace engineering, 
that's where my PhD is, but also studied

01:01.050 --> 01:06.890
mathematics and math too. But I was brought into 
the Department of Aerospace Engineering here

01:06.870 --> 01:14.390
back in 1964. You were gone for a few years, right? 
Yeah, I made the mistake of leaving Texas A&M at one

01:17.370 --> 01:23.390
time. I was offered a job as a department head at 
Maryland and left and went up there. My

01:31.560 --> 01:42.410
family and I discovered that some hard-bitten old 
Midwestern conservatives didn't fit well into

01:42.390 --> 01:48.410
the heartland of the liberal eastern 
establishment. And... And it was really

01:48.390 --> 01:52.880
principally Washington. It wasn't the 
University of Maryland. I enjoyed the university

01:54.390 --> 02:00.320
and had a great time there. But it was just the 
general mood and environment of Washington, D.C.

02:00.300 --> 02:08.760
itself that we didn't fit into. And so after we were 
there a couple of years, I determined that I had

02:08.740 --> 02:14.760
made a mistake and

02:14.740 --> 02:22.540
taken the family there and decided to go 
elsewhere. And I actually was pursuing some jobs

02:22.520 --> 02:30.730
in some other areas. And I thought, well, I would 
contact Fred Benson, who was dean here. And he was

02:36.890 --> 02:43.910
kind enough to offer me an opportunity to come back 
to Texas A&M. And so we did come back then in the

02:43.890 --> 02:47.910
early 70s. That was a right move, incidentally. 
When you first came here, what type of research was

02:51.460 --> 02:56.480
going on? Well, that's a very relevant question 
regarding the history and general impact of TEAS.

03:05.540 --> 03:16.720
Because

03:05.540 --> 03:16.720
within the Aero Department, there wasn't any 
research

03:05.540 --> 03:16.720
going on. Mr. Rutter was our president then. He 
recognized that research was key to the image of an

03:18.700 --> 03:30.540
institution that aspired to greatness. But

03:30.520 --> 03:36.210
any of the so-called... Great universities,

03:37.190 --> 03:52.610
their reputation is built more on their research 
than on their academic programs. In my view, the

03:52.590 --> 03:57.730
undergraduate program at MIT, for example, is 
rather pedestrian. And I just assumed if I had a

03:57.710 --> 04:03.290
student who wanted to study... A son who wanted to 
study aerospace engineering, I'd just...

04:06.270 --> 04:09.290
Frankly, I'd rather have him here than MIT. And 
when you get into graduate work, that's something

04:09.270 --> 04:12.290
else again. It's a different story. But it is 
research that... That

04:16.270 --> 04:21.500
makes the image of an institution. I

04:21.480 --> 04:28.050
once heard that Mr. Rutter had said, I don't know 
whether it's true or not, that he was going to make

04:28.030 --> 04:32.580
Texas A&M the MIT of the Southwest, or I guess that 
would also mean possibly make MIT the Texas A&M of

04:32.560 --> 04:37.580
the Northeast or something, although they'd have 
to go a bit to do that. But

04:40.560 --> 04:49.970
it was clear that when I was hired here in 64, they 
didn't ask whether I could teach or not. They were

04:54.870 --> 05:01.640
interested in the fact that I had been involved in a 
very active research program, and above all, I

05:01.620 --> 05:06.070
knew how to hustle money and

05:06.050 --> 05:13.230
convince sponsors that they ought to give me money 
for research. There wasn't any... It was...

05:16.640 --> 05:24.230
That's what I was supposed to do. Because, as I say, 
when I came into the aerial department, as I

05:27.210 --> 05:39.100
recall,

05:27.210 --> 05:39.100
there was not anyone at that

05:27.210 --> 05:39.100
time. Now, they had had some off and on, but there 
wasn't any... There wasn't any large, consistent

05:43.770 --> 05:49.060
program. You did mostly aeronautical research 
versus aerospace, too. Well, it wasn't even...

05:55.710 --> 05:58.730
No, I don't make any distinction there. Oh, okay. 
Yeah. Now, shortly after I came here, there was

06:00.960 --> 06:07.220
another group within AERO and coupled with ME that 
had a piece of research dealing with propeller

06:07.200 --> 06:17.540
thrust studies.

06:17.520 --> 06:34.410
And I'm sure they would have gotten that,

06:17.520 --> 06:34.410
had...

06:34.390 --> 06:42.420
That was the directive that was given to

06:34.390 --> 06:42.420
me. And... But did it change much between the time 
you came and... No. No. It hasn't

06:52.560 --> 07:04.710
changed all that much today. Now, the structure 
has changed a bit. It was what it is now and what it

07:08.160 --> 07:15.530
was then.

07:15.510 --> 07:29.160
And this gets into some of the personnel changes 
that were in since 64.

07:29.140 --> 07:30.231
I cannot... I cannot overemphasize the 
importance of TEA. In that whole process. And as a

07:36.480 --> 07:41.500
matter of fact, the importance of TEA's in my 
decision to come to Texas A&M. And

07:41.480 --> 07:49.290
if you want to get into that now, we can. But it 
wasn't absolutely critical. Because quite

07:52.270 --> 07:59.390
frankly, I think if there hadn't been TEA's, I 
wouldn't have come to Texas A&M. It's that simple.

08:00.370 --> 08:15.850
And

08:00.370 --> 08:15.850
I well remember

08:00.370 --> 08:15.850
what a very positive reaction that I had after

08:00.370 --> 08:15.850
my interview. Because I thought, these people 
know how it's done. And the positive reaction came

08:20.900 --> 08:25.920
largely from two men. Al Kronk, who was then the 
head of the Aerospace Department. And above all,

08:29.900 --> 08:31.920
Harry Whitmore. Who had just come in, I think, in 
what, 63, I think? Just a year before to head up the

08:36.900 --> 08:41.920
Space Technology Division, so-called. Now, I'm 
going to say some... Make some comments here that

08:45.210 --> 08:48.230
would appear to be critical of Al Kronk. But they 
should not be interpreted that way. He was, and

08:54.210 --> 09:02.500
still is, although he's in poor health now, a hell 
of a guy. And I really came to love that man.

09:06.480 --> 09:13.500
However, Al was like so many of our engineering 
department heads back in those days. In that he was

09:13.480 --> 09:17.500
not research-oriented. He did not promote 
research. He did not push faculty to do research.

09:26.100 --> 09:34.330
Texas A&M's image back in the 50s, I think, 
although it's not here. But I think it was one of the

09:34.310 --> 09:44.230
super undergraduate educational institutions.

09:44.210 --> 09:52.230
And in the engineering, it turned out people that 
were very well equipped to go into industry. And do

09:52.210 --> 09:54.830
the job. But as I say, when Mr. Rutter came aboard in 
about 58, I guess, as chancellor, I think, or

09:54.810 --> 10:03.780
president. I'm not really sure how that all 
happened. But he was the one who really started to

10:06.760 --> 10:17.180
promote research activities at Texas A&M. Well, 
we had, as I say, we had a number of engineering

10:17.160 --> 10:23.180
department heads. Cliff Semang in mechanical 
engineering. Bob Whiting in petroleum

10:27.160 --> 10:29.180
engineering. And on and on. Burgess in industrial 
engineering. Great guys. Super teachers. Super

10:38.940 --> 10:41.450
educators. But researchers,

10:41.470 --> 10:49.500
quite honestly, it was always my perception. 
Nobody ever told me this. But it was always my

10:50.480 --> 10:58.060
perception that the space technology division 
and Mr. Whitmore were set up. To, well, one might

10:58.040 --> 11:04.420
say to go around Al Kronk. And I suppose, you know, 
that wouldn't be too far off base. But really it was

11:07.400 --> 11:16.340
more to supplement what was Kronk, what Professor 
Kronk was doing in the educational arena. And get a

11:16.320 --> 11:21.190
very definite research thrust going. To

11:21.170 --> 11:38.900
me, when I came down here in the spring of 64, TEAS

11:21.170 --> 11:38.900
had money to spend in the promotion of research. 
And above all, they knew what that meant. This had

11:42.410 --> 11:50.540
just a tremendous impact on it. Because I was, I had 
determined, although I looked at industry when I

11:50.520 --> 11:57.910
decided to leave Ohio State. I had determined I was 
going to stay in the academic world. I

12:02.040 --> 12:11.400
went over, well, among the institutions that I 
interviewed was Georgia Tech. And they had a

12:11.380 --> 12:15.160
pretty good research program. But I was 
absolutely turned off by their attitude. They

12:20.480 --> 12:23.500
wanted me to promote research. They wanted me to 
hustle money. And I said to them, well, do you have

12:26.050 --> 12:33.930
money to travel, you know, to go visit research 
funds? And they said, well, you can take that out of

12:33.910 --> 12:36.930
your research money. I said, wait a minute. You 
can't, you know, you're asking me to pull myself up

12:40.490 --> 12:45.370
by my boot straps. You've got to prime the pump a bit 
here, you know. And it was clear they weren't all

12:49.200 --> 12:53.980
that willing to do that. But Mr. Whitmore and TEAS. 
Were willing. And he understood. And keep in mind,

13:00.430 --> 13:05.620
of course, not a lot of that credit goes to Fred 
Benson. Because he understands, too, what is

13:05.600 --> 13:11.450
involved in building a program. And it's 
something that you just don't do overnight. So

13:16.000 --> 13:29.550
they understood that in the promotion of 
research, one does not sit down and write out a

13:16.000 --> 13:29.550
proposal. However technically excellent it 
might be. And send it to the sponsor, the potential

13:33.040 --> 13:37.210
sponsor. And say, send money by return made. It 
just does not happen that way. You must go there.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.520
You must sell yourself. You

13:46.500 --> 13:51.070
have to hustle. And that, to some, is sort of the 
senior side of academia. But you've got to do it.

13:59.080 --> 14:03.100
And there's just no substitute for having support 
of that type. And

14:03.080 --> 14:08.690
I think that, and having the Research Foundation. 
Of course, it was a great thing. Of course, it was a

14:09.670 --> 14:12.100
great asset, too. Because there you could get a 
professional-looking proposal turned out.

14:17.080 --> 14:25.020
Obviously, they, coupled with TEAS, would help 
you manage your project, your money, once you got

14:17.080 --> 14:25.020
it. And that's essential. Because when I went, 
again, just to illustrate. When I went to the

14:30.280 --> 14:34.180
University of Maryland. Again, I went into a 
department, if you can believe this, 20 minutes

14:34.160 --> 14:41.200
from downtown Washington. Where many of the 
research sponsors were located. And again, when I

14:45.810 --> 14:50.830
went to Maryland, that department had not paid 
anyone a research. And

14:50.810 --> 14:56.500
they did not have a research foundation. They did 
not have a research foundation. And I lucked out

14:59.480 --> 15:06.500
and rather quickly got a nice grant from NASA to do 
some wind tunnel studies. And I had to hire a gal

15:06.480 --> 15:12.500
into the department office there to keep books on 
this project. You know, the very sorts of things

15:12.480 --> 15:22.000
that the Research Foundation and TEAS do for you. 
Well, that kind of support, you see, is just

15:21.980 --> 15:30.540
inestimable value in the promotion of research. 
And

15:30.520 --> 15:36.010
so all of that infrastructure was here. And of 
course, Ohio State had had a very strong research

15:35.990 --> 15:40.260
foundation. Their engineering experiment 
station was nothing

15:40.240 --> 15:47.060
like this. So I had some appreciation of what these 
support institutions could do for you. And that

15:54.040 --> 15:55.621
was all here. And that was all in place. And to have 
that, you see, coupled with Mr. Whitmore's

15:57.040 --> 16:04.480
attitude. You know, yeah, I got some money for you. 
You need help. You come see me. And it was just too

16:10.680 --> 16:15.550
good to pass up. Of course, you know, I'd have to say 
that there were some other factors. And I

16:19.780 --> 16:35.270
liked the attitude of the people.

16:35.250 --> 16:51.150
But in terms

16:35.250 --> 16:51.150
of Dick Thomas' professional development, I 
don't think I could have found, and frankly, I tell

16:51.130 --> 16:58.270
young people today, I don't think they could find 
today any better atmosphere. Although the

16:58.250 --> 17:02.270
teaching loans, of course, have increased 
substantially in recent years. And that's, I

17:02.250 --> 17:06.490
know, a very negative factor in recruiting 
people. But in terms of promoting research, it's

17:06.470 --> 17:11.470
difficult to find a better atmosphere. They have 
to find a better environment, a better atmosphere

17:11.450 --> 17:18.620
in which to do that. So T's contributed heavily, I 
think, to the elevation of Texas A&M's image as a

17:18.600 --> 17:30.100
research institution. We've still got a ways to 
go. But when you look, when you consider about 26

17:32.710 --> 17:44.850
years since Mr. Rutter took over and set us on this 
path, if you look back at what we've accomplished

17:44.830 --> 17:50.540
in those 25 years, it's really quite incredible. 
It really is. A lot of people don't appreciate

17:52.324 --> 17:53.540
that. But T's contributed heavily to that. When 
you first came, was the wind tunnel still housing

17:55.520 --> 18:02.030
hay? Was it still what? Was it still a hay barn? 
Well, not quite. Almost.

18:12.670 --> 18:14.690
They know where to start. My, that brings back a lot 
of memories.

18:25.320 --> 18:32.340
The wind tunnel was there and had recently, that 
is, I say recently, but I think, I'm not sure when it

18:25.320 --> 18:32.340
was, I think in the late 50s and early 60s, had been 
upgraded. Because initially it was an open

18:35.340 --> 18:41.670
circuit or an open throat type wind tunnel. And 
that, you just have difficulty doing precise

18:41.650 --> 18:50.460
research in a facility like that. And so they had 
put in the, they had closed it, they had put in the

18:50.440 --> 18:55.490
return leg. And Joe Bruce and his crew had a 
magnificent job of ferreting out sources of

18:55.470 --> 19:09.610
turbulence and instability in the tunnel. And 
they had put in the balance to measure forces on

19:09.590 --> 19:16.360
models. And,

19:16.340 --> 19:27.370
but it had kind of fallen on hard times because I 
think, although they had put in the balance, they

19:27.350 --> 19:29.370
did not put in a data system. A system that would 
more or less automatically, excuse me,

19:29.350 --> 19:42.460
automatically

19:29.350 --> 19:42.460
process the data coming out of the balance and out 
of the wind tunnel. And I don't know whether that

19:42.440 --> 19:46.740
was, well, there was another problem too. I should 
back up here a bit and say, as you've probably

19:46.720 --> 19:53.740
already been told,

19:53.720 --> 20:05.890
it was hoped that by upgrading the tunnel could do, 
it could support itself with commercial testing

20:05.870 --> 20:10.650
for like LTD and general dynamics and others. And 
it also, of course, it would provide a basis for

20:10.630 --> 20:18.930
some good aerodynamic research. Well, at about 
that time, for whatever reason,

20:18.910 --> 20:32.580
building its own wind tunnel facilities and other 
organizations did too. And I think that, coupled

20:32.560 --> 20:49.900
with the fact that we weren't really wind tunnel

20:32.560 --> 20:49.900
data,

20:49.880 --> 20:56.100
it just led to the circumstance that occurred when 
I came in, and that was that the wind tunnel had been

20:56.080 --> 20:59.100
shut down basically. We were just sitting there 
gathering dust. And so, to that extent, it was, I

21:02.740 --> 21:17.700
think,

21:02.740 --> 21:17.700
I remember one of the first groups of students that 
I had. The first courses I taught dealt with

21:17.680 --> 21:24.180
low-speed aerodynamics. And so, I went across

21:24.160 --> 21:33.940
and used the wind tunnel for some student 
demonstrations.

21:37.310 --> 21:44.330
And so, I took a bunch of students out there, and 
down in the basement of the tunnel, we found a big

21:44.310 --> 21:47.330
box that looked rather like a coffin. But in that 
box, we found a model, a wind tunnel model. And it

21:51.360 --> 22:02.760
had been, it was a,

21:51.360 --> 22:02.760
that's the T in LTV.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.020
Temco, back, I don't know, back in the 50s, was 
preparing a bid on the, development and

22:14.000 --> 22:20.070
production of a cargo airplane for the Air Force or 
something. And they had this model. And

22:23.050 --> 22:27.070
apparently, they were unsuccessful in their bid. 
And then, of course, were then absorbed by, and

22:35.200 --> 22:39.600
apparently never took the model back. And so, the 
traditional Aggie enthusiasm, my students tore

22:47.910 --> 22:49.930
into that thing. They assembled the model. We 
installed it in the wind tunnel with Mr. Bruce's

22:52.910 --> 22:58.080
invaluable assistance. And we ran a series of 
tests on that model. And again, this was just

23:02.060 --> 23:10.070
principally for the educational.

23:10.050 --> 23:14.070
But we sort of blew the dust out of the tunnel at that 
time. And I guess it was through that experience

23:14.050 --> 23:23.260
that I

23:14.050 --> 23:23.260
became convinced that it was a fine facility. 
Excellent flow characteristics.

23:34.880 --> 23:39.900
And I thought it, you know, I thought it was 
possible to do some research. And although that,

23:39.880 --> 23:44.580
it was out of my area. I mean, I was trained 
principally in hypersonic aerodynamics

23:44.560 --> 23:58.900
and not in M number.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.900
But I learned to fly during World War II. And I still 
enjoy flying. And so, you know, to that extent,

24:01.880 --> 24:09.380
because of the airplanes I fly, they'll go. And I, 
we

24:09.360 --> 24:23.060
were fortunate then in the mid-60s to get some work 
for NASA. From NASA. For work in the wind tunnel.

24:28.040 --> 24:34.910
But here again, you see, this, I well remember a 
trip that I took to NASA Langley after having done

24:34.890 --> 24:38.910
what ground work I could do by phone. And I went up 
there and talked to a guy who eventually became a

24:38.890 --> 24:44.770
very good friend, Mr. Jerry Rainey. And

24:46.960 --> 24:54.030
essentially convinced him that he ought to give 
some money to Texas A&M. And he did. And you see, if

24:55.010 --> 25:00.340
I'd been at Georgia Tech, for example, or some 
other institution that didn't have that support

25:00.320 --> 25:04.340
for you, it would have just been impossible. And

25:06.320 --> 25:14.000
there was another element to that, incidentally, 
thinking back on it. The aero department has a

25:13.980 --> 25:18.000
small wind tunnel, a two foot by three foot, I think 
it is. Yeah, I've seen that. That's not anywhere

25:19.980 --> 25:22.000
near the same wind tunnel. Right. Okay. However. 
We were doing some work on dust generator. We were

25:27.980 --> 25:33.630
proposing for Langley to do some work on dust 
generation. And we built a little prototype of our

25:33.610 --> 25:40.720
dust generator and put it in that tunnel, in that 
small tunnel, to prove the concept. And that

25:44.300 --> 25:52.240
construction of that little prototype was done 
with key's money. And I'm sure that when I went to

25:52.220 --> 25:56.240
see Mr. Rainey at Langley and I showed him, I said, 
you know, here we did a little, very crude

25:56.220 --> 26:04.710
improvisation of what we wanted to do in the big 
tunnel. And

26:04.690 --> 26:09.070
he was impressed with that. And so here, this is 
just the way, just the way T's work, you see, the T's

26:09.050 --> 26:17.150
money works. Just absolutely invaluable. When 
you came back in 1971, did you become involved in

26:22.960 --> 26:29.980
the shuttle research? In what? Shuttle research? 
No. No. No. What were you doing? When I, you see, in

26:35.960 --> 26:51.610
1970 or, well, 69, when Neil Armstrong set foot on 
the moon, the space program started downhill. And

26:53.590 --> 27:03.960
also, for the first time in history, all three of 
the support areas generally active in aerospace

27:03.940 --> 27:05.960
engineering went downhill. And that's because 
aerospace engineering in the 60's and so forth,

27:05.940 --> 27:12.960
70's, rested on a three legged stool. One is 
commercial and general aviation. Another one is

27:19.340 --> 27:24.510
military aviation and the third is space. And 
generally, in times past, those things would not

27:24.490 --> 27:30.300
be synchronized. That is, if one went down, one of 
the other would be going up and things were

27:30.280 --> 27:35.300
relatively balanced. In the 60's and early 70's, 
for the first time in history, they all three went

27:37.505 --> 27:47.530
down together. It was not a good time for an 
aerospace engineer to be out looking for a job.

27:55.440 --> 28:04.780
Research

27:55.440 --> 28:04.780
money had dried

27:55.440 --> 28:04.780
up. The student enrollments went down in the early 
70's because engineers couldn't get jobs.

28:14.660 --> 28:18.680
The department over here had more faculty than it 
needed. Norton

28:18.660 --> 28:27.850
and others will tell you, Jim Strickland, when he 
was in the lot. They were urged to go out and hustle

28:27.830 --> 28:34.850
the research money in order to keep themselves 
afloat financially. Because they just, I think by

28:36.797 --> 28:43.700
1973 or 4, I think the total number of graduates out 
of the department is something like 20. They

28:45.680 --> 28:51.240
get dried up and hurt. And so, when I came back, Mr.

28:51.220 --> 29:05.690
Benson put me in a position as a special assistant 
to him. Uh. And so, after that, I was able to take the

29:06.984 --> 29:08.480
job. And so, that was really off the task of simply 
promoting some new research for the 14's and for

29:13.460 --> 29:16.480
the College of Engineering. And

29:16.460 --> 29:25.300
I did not, as a matter of fact, my title at that time, 
my academic title was professor of engineering,

29:25.280 --> 29:29.340
professor of aerospace engineering. And so, it 
was only later on when the enrollments came back

29:29.320 --> 29:44.750
that I got to say, no,

29:29.320 --> 29:44.750
not anything to do a test.

29:53.600 --> 30:02.570
Prior to those tests, we did get the wind tunnel 
back in operation, and we had a going facility. And

30:02.550 --> 30:11.490
then, of course, NASA came in and bought us a data 
system, bought us a computer to do the processing,

30:11.470 --> 30:15.490
and that's the kind of a facility we should have had 
back in the early 60s. Did they have those types of

30:15.470 --> 30:19.490
things developed in the early 60s? Yeah, they were 
mostly analog computers. But, yeah,

30:24.197 --> 30:39.140
they had facilities

30:24.197 --> 30:39.140
that made it. And that was the big problem.

30:46.654 --> 30:55.750
You see, when a guy runs a wind tunnel test, he wants 
the results right now. Because, of course,

30:55.730 --> 31:06.150
oftentimes, if you look at the data, the way that 
looks and his interpretation of that, that will

31:06.130 --> 31:09.150
determine what the next test is going to be. Well, 
you see, the setup they had in the late 50s and early

31:09.130 --> 31:14.150
60s was such that . . . . . . they could take data in a 
very raw form, and they had to bring it into the DPC,

31:15.773 --> 31:24.270
punch it into CARMS, and then process it the next 
day. You know, the sponsors . . .

31:38.600 --> 31:46.279
When you came back as the assistant, were other 
departments besides aerospace having . . . Were

31:46.480 --> 31:49.020
they what? Were other departments having trouble 
getting research money, too? Was there a slope in

31:52.044 --> 31:54.020
any of the others? Oh, no, dear, I don't think I'd 
say that.

32:01.100 --> 32:10.120
Incidentally, we're skipping over some other 
things here that occurred in the late 60s that

32:01.100 --> 32:10.120
would involve TEAS, and I guess we ought to come 
back and talk about those. Because, you see, we

32:13.100 --> 32:19.380
haven't talked about the flight lab, we haven't 
talked about the shock tube, both of which

32:19.360 --> 32:30.020
resulted

32:19.360 --> 32:30.020
totally from what TEAS did.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.435
But to answer your question, no, there . . . . . . in 
the 60s and 70s,

32:42.070 --> 32:48.780
there was a general push toward the hiring of 
faculty that had research capability. And so,

32:48.760 --> 32:51.557
just as I had been hired into AERO to . . . and had

32:51.760 --> 33:04.960
been successful in hiring other people in other 
departments. And so, I think Texas A&M was moving

33:04.940 --> 33:16.410
on a fairly broad front

33:04.940 --> 33:16.410
in research. Now, these were mainly in what you 
might call the traditional.

33:23.940 --> 33:32.254
And so, when I came back,

33:23.940 --> 33:32.254
I had a . . . before I came back, I had a conversation 
with . . . a conversation I'll never forget. And he .

33:44.673 --> 33:45.296
. . and incidentally, I was not an assistant dean. I 
was a special assistant to the dean. And so, it was

33:54.800 --> 34:00.670
purely a research. It had no academic . . . and I 
didn't work with . . . But

34:05.080 --> 34:30.940
Mr. Benson,

34:05.080 --> 34:30.940
a lot

34:05.080 --> 34:30.940
of

34:05.080 --> 34:30.940
people think that he's a staid

34:05.080 --> 34:30.940
outreach. Because

34:30.920 --> 34:39.329
. . . and here again, this was . . . this was a kind of a 
typical TEAS operation. He just simply wanted me

34:46.710 --> 34:51.529
to find some new areas in which . . . in which TEAS and 
the college of engineering could work.

34:54.710 --> 35:01.169
Non-traditional

34:54.710 --> 35:01.169
areas. And as far as he was concerned,

35:01.189 --> 35:08.370
I had carte blanche to move in any direction I 
wanted. It was as if he had given me a little chunk of

35:08.350 --> 35:15.410
money, which he did. And said, in effect, here, go 
do something great with this. And it was

35:19.510 --> 35:22.449
absolutely one of the most exhilarating 
experiences . . . I've ever had in my life. He . . . and

35:27.897 --> 35:33.690
he just ran some things by me, you know, the way he 
was thinking. He said that . . . he thought that . . .

35:39.200 --> 35:49.380
Of course, keep in mind, we were in the midst of the 
Vietnam debacle at that time. He said, you know,

35:49.360 --> 36:03.400
for the first time in history, our technology has

35:49.360 --> 36:03.400
failed us. But he suggested that . . . that we might 
do a piece of research . . . looking at why

36:08.380 --> 36:11.339
technology failed . . . or if technology had . . . and 
if it had, why it had. That . . . and I nosed into it a

36:22.772 --> 36:31.290
little bit to find out that . . . at that point, there 
was so much stonewalling going on. Of course, you

36:33.350 --> 36:36.705
had . . . you'd have to have access to classified 
data. So, we didn't pursue that. He was very

36:43.970 --> 36:50.820
concerned about advanced transportation 
systems. And that kind of surprised me, because,

36:50.800 --> 36:54.820
of course, he had been the founder of TTO. But he was 
concerned . . . he was concerned that TTI was not

36:58.740 --> 37:02.760
reaching out far enough. And they were too content 
to sit here doing highway research. I mean, good

37:06.990 --> 37:08.011
stuff. Don't misunderstand. Good stuff. But . . . 
But research that was, again, pretty traditional

37:10.990 --> 37:15.010
stuff. And at that time, there was great interest 
in some of these people-mover systems . . . and

37:20.330 --> 37:29.140
old things like the air trans up at Dallas . . . the 
DFW airport . . . you know, unmanned, automated . . .

37:32.200 --> 37:37.600
kinds of systems.

37:37.580 --> 37:39.600
And he thought we ought to be getting into that. And 
so, we did mount some efforts in that. The

37:44.630 --> 38:01.287
whole issue of productivity and to use new 
technology

37:44.630 --> 38:01.287
. . . to increase the efficiency of manufacturing 
and production . . . is still, of course, very, very

38:06.850 --> 38:14.190
hot to Mr. Benson . . . that he saw that coming down 
the road.

38:21.080 --> 38:30.750
So, as I say, he just

38:21.080 --> 38:30.750
wanted me to sort of follow my nose . . . and try to 
develop some new research areas for the . . . That

38:40.470 --> 38:44.020
was my assignment when I came here. You said 
productivity developed into being here. What

38:49.040 --> 38:52.060
group was it that was doing this? Well, there 
wasn't any group doing it at the time. Yeah, when

38:54.040 --> 38:54.894
you said . . . And

38:55.040 --> 38:59.763
so, the . . . well, the people that we drew on . . . to 
folks out of industrial engineering . . . there

39:09.030 --> 39:16.349
were some other folks in ME and EE . . . that put the 
involvement principle . . . came out of industrial

39:21.660 --> 39:23.700
engineering. But the thrust of that, as it turned 
out, was . . . well, I guess there were two things.

39:37.620 --> 39:43.700
One major thrust dealt with technology transfer. 
That has a different connotation today than it did

39:43.680 --> 39:46.700
then. Those words nowadays, when you say 
technology transfer . . . generally talk . . .

39:53.608 --> 39:54.439
people are talking about . . . the movement of 
technology from the U.S. to the Soviet Union . . .

40:01.180 --> 40:03.610
and a vital question. But back in those days . . . it 
had to do with what might better be called . . . the

40:08.160 --> 40:10.180
diffusion of technology. That is to say, one of the 
things we studied . . . dealt with numerically

40:14.500 --> 40:18.520
controlled machines. These are machine tools . . . 
Lays, milling machines, and so forth . . . that

40:23.500 --> 40:27.679
early on were controlled by . . . what you might call 
a very crude computer. It was a numerical system . .

40:34.770 --> 40:34.790
. an automated system . . . based on punched paper 
tapes . . . paper tape with holes in it . . . that

40:40.770 --> 40:43.790
contained signals that would guide the machine. 
And so, instead of having a machinist sit there . . .

40:46.770 --> 40:49.689
with his eye twisting the knobs very carefully . . . 
and so forth . . . it was all automated. If you went up

40:54.240 --> 40:57.098
to General Dynamics . . . for example, and bought . . 
. aerospace manufacturers, for example . . . you'd

41:03.110 --> 41:05.130
find lots of NC machines. You'd go to Hughes Tool . . 
. or Cameron Ironworks . . . or some of the smaller

41:09.580 --> 41:11.519
machine shops . . . that populated Houston

41:11.580 --> 41:19.198
. . . which indicated that, for some reason or other 
. . . that technology had not diffused . . . had not

41:25.680 --> 41:30.360
moved through American industry. And the belief 
was, quite properly . . . that if we could do that . . .

41:34.340 --> 41:36.619
if we could somehow stimulate that . . . that we 
could help industry increase its productivity . .

41:38.680 --> 41:38.700
. become more efficient . . . become more 
competitive with Japan and Germany. So, that was

41:44.050 --> 41:46.989
the general idea . . . that it headed much toward the 
. . . Was

41:51.190 --> 41:56.700
there a particular center? No.

41:59.975 --> 42:01.260
No. It never evolved into that. We just simply 
called it the Productivity Program. And

42:06.890 --> 42:14.920
we had a problem emerge there . . . quite honestly, 
that we still have today. And

42:16.980 --> 42:22.889
this is . . . I guess here I'm going . . . I'm about to 
utter my first critical remark . . . of Tease.

42:36.215 --> 42:37.320
The kinds of work that I . . . was attempting to 
promote there . . . as I've already indicated . . .

42:40.720 --> 42:42.454
was interdisciplinary. That is to say, we needed 
to get . . . industrial, mechanical, and

42:45.640 --> 42:51.950
electrical engineers. The reward system as it is 
set up now . . . and Tease has been part of this . . . is

42:57.930 --> 43:02.059
one wherein a department head . . . and a faculty 
member . . . is credited . . . literally credited . . .

43:08.150 --> 43:11.420
with the money he brings to his department. And . . . 
if a guy . . . let's suppose that a program . . . is

43:18.440 --> 43:23.070
focused in some external center . . . in this 
center, for example . . . we still have this

43:25.130 --> 43:27.400
problem. If I get a half million dollars . . . to do a 
piece of research . . . and I go to mechanical

43:34.760 --> 43:37.699
engineering . . . and electrical engineering . . . 
and any engineering . . . simply

43:40.760 --> 43:47.196
because the work is attractive . . . I get, say, 
three million dollars . . . one from each one of

43:49.700 --> 43:52.619
those departments . . . to work with me on the 
project . . . they don't get any credit for that. And

43:58.800 --> 44:04.417
a portion . . . although they would deserve . . . the 
department would be . . . would deserve credit . . .

44:11.430 --> 44:13.348
for a portion of that money . . . that I've gotten . . . 
because I got the money . . . based on the

44:15.430 --> 44:16.347
capabilities . . . that exist over there in the city 
. . . but the way the reward structure is set up . . . it

44:22.600 --> 44:24.620
doesn't address that. And so that's a . . . that's a 
real severe problem . . . that, as I say, exists . . .

44:32.510 --> 44:38.467
and tease

44:32.510 --> 44:38.467
about this . . . and they nod

44:38.950 --> 44:43.800
every time . . . I complain . . .

44:50.920 --> 44:51.858
so what . . . the productivity program . . . that

44:53.920 --> 45:04.970
when

44:53.920 --> 45:04.970
I got some money . . . we got some money . . . from the 
National Science Foundation . . . industrial

45:08.310 --> 45:09.247
engineering . . . took their little chunk of money . 
. . and went back to industrial engineering . . . and

45:13.310 --> 45:14.247
did their little thing . . . and they said to hell . . . 
with these other guys . . . and I was just . . . I was

45:18.400 --> 45:19.338
just . . . absolutely unable . . . to bring any kind . . 
. of an interdisciplinary . . . and

45:26.940 --> 45:33.998
so . . . there's a real problem there . . . that 
somehow . . . someway we have to . . . it's not a . . .

45:45.760 --> 45:46.698
it's not an easy thing . . . and Texas A&M and TEAS . . . 
is not the only one . . . that has that problem . . .

45:50.760 --> 45:51.698
it's a universal problem . . . but the . . . the 
productivity . . .
