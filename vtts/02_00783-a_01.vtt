00:04.030 --> 00:10.440
This is Deborah Beale, and I am interviewing Dr. 
Richard Thomas on the history of the Texas

00:04.030 --> 00:10.440
Engineering Experiment Station. The date is June 
15, 1984. Factory section on here already. So tell

00:17.951 --> 00:19.213
us who you are. But I'd like to get

00:19.273 --> 00:28.047
some background on your education and how you came 
down here. Well, let me say how far back in it you

00:28.507 --> 00:32.333
talked about the university education 
principle. I did all my work up at Ohio State and

00:33.460 --> 00:51.846
left there in 1964 and came to Texas A&M at that 
time.

00:53.288 --> 00:59.698
My background is basically aerospace 
engineering. That's the area in which my PhD is. I

01:03.532 --> 01:07.798
also studied mathematics and math, too. But I was 
brought into the Department of Aerospace

01:07.818 --> 01:14.908
Engineering here back in 1964. You were gone for a 
few years, right? You went to Maryland? Yeah,

01:19.854 --> 01:20.175
yeah. I made the mistake of leaving Texas A&M at one 
time, and I was offered a job as a department head at

01:20.195 --> 01:31.851
Maryland, and left and went up there. My family and 
I discovered that some hard-bitten old

01:33.012 --> 01:48.890
Midwestern conservatives didn't fit well into 
the heartland of the liberal eastern

01:33.012 --> 01:48.890
establishment. And it was really principally 
Washington. It wasn't the University of

01:52.915 --> 01:54.957
Maryland. I enjoyed the university and had a great 
time there, but it was just the the general mood and

02:03.455 --> 02:08.841
environment of Washington, D.C. itself that we 
didn't fit into. And so after we were there a couple

02:08.921 --> 02:30.846
of years, I determined that I had made a mistake in

02:08.921 --> 02:30.846
taking the family there and decided to go 
elsewhere and actually was pursuing some jobs in

02:08.921 --> 02:30.846
some other areas. and thought, well, I would 
contact Fred Benson, who was deemed here. And he

02:38.098 --> 02:43.967
was kind enough to offer me an opportunity to come 
back to Texas A&M. And so we did come back then in the

02:43.987 --> 02:46.972
early 70s. That was a right move, incidentally. 
When you first came here, what type of research was

02:52.902 --> 02:56.648
going on? Well, that's a very relevant question 
regarding the history and the impact of TEAS

02:58.045 --> 03:15.272
because

02:58.045 --> 03:15.272
within the Aero Department there wasn't any 
research going on. And, of course, Mr. Rutter was

03:15.292 --> 03:24.947
our president

03:15.292 --> 03:24.947
then and he recognized that that research was key 
to the image of an institution that aspired to

03:25.400 --> 03:32.311
greatness.

03:34.595 --> 03:51.222
I think if we take a look at any of the so-called 
great universities, particularly

03:34.595 --> 03:51.222
technological universities like MIT or Stanford 
or Caltech or any of those, their reputation is

03:34.595 --> 03:51.222
built more on their research than on their 
academic programs. In my view, the undergraduate

03:52.130 --> 03:58.058
programs at MIT, for example, are rather 
pedestrian.

03:59.620 --> 04:08.973
And I just assume if I had a student who wanted to 
study, a son who wanted to study aerospace

03:59.620 --> 04:08.973
engineering, I'd just, frankly, I'd rather have 
him here than at MIT. But when you get into graduate

04:08.993 --> 04:11.577
work, that's something else again. It's a 
different story. But it is research that makes the

04:14.100 --> 04:21.310
image of an institution And I once heard that Mr. 
Rutter had said, I don't know whether it's true or

04:21.644 --> 04:40.883
not, that he was going to make Texas A&M the MIT of 
the Southwest, or I guess that would also mean

04:21.644 --> 04:40.883
possibly make MIT the Texas A&M of the Northeast or 
something, although they'd have to go a bit to do

04:21.644 --> 04:40.883
that.

04:45.247 --> 04:49.491
But it was clear that when I was hired here in 64, 
They didn't ask whether I could teach or not. They

04:57.062 --> 05:02.971
were interested in the fact that I had been 
involved in a very active research program at Ohio

04:57.062 --> 05:02.971
State. And above all, I knew how to hustle money. I 
knew how to go out and convince sponsors that they

05:06.897 --> 05:14.448
ought to give me money for research. And there 
wasn't any, it was very clear, But when I was

05:19.576 --> 05:24.845
brought in, that's what I was supposed to do. 
Because, as I say, when I came into the Air

05:24.905 --> 05:39.709
Department, as I recall,

05:24.905 --> 05:39.709
there was not any one of those sponsored research 
work underway in that department at that time.

05:39.729 --> 05:42.073
Now, they had had some off and on. But there wasn't 
any large, consistent program.

05:52.820 --> 06:00.849
Well, it wasn't even... No, I don't make any 
distinction there.

06:00.889 --> 06:03.893
Shortly after I came here, there was another 
group. within Arrow and coupled with ME that had a

06:05.307 --> 06:15.298
piece of research dealing with propeller thrust 
studies.

06:17.460 --> 06:26.229
And I'm sure they would have gotten that had I not 
been there. But

06:26.249 --> 06:33.677
the directive that was given to me was to go bring

06:34.180 --> 06:43.694
money. And, but did it change much between

06:43.714 --> 06:51.145
the time you came and the 7th? No, no, uh-uh, no. I 
don't think it, I don't think it had changed much

06:53.388 --> 06:59.817
and moreover I don't think that I don't think it's 
changed all that much today. Now, the structure

07:04.437 --> 07:12.607
has changed a bit between what it was, what it is 
now, and what it was then.

07:15.290 --> 07:27.846
And this gets into some of the personnel changes 
that have occurred between, since 64

07:15.290 --> 07:27.846
and now. I cannot overemphasize the importance of 
TEAS in that whole process. And as a matter of fact,

07:37.134 --> 07:44.841
the importance of TEAS in my decision to come to 
Texas A&M.

07:44.861 --> 07:47.864
And if you want to get into that now, we can. But it 
was an absolutely critical thing. Because quite

07:53.510 --> 07:55.352
frankly, I think if If there hadn't been T's, I 
wouldn't have come to Texas A&M. It's that simple.

08:04.064 --> 08:21.749
And I well remember

08:04.064 --> 08:21.749
what a very positive reaction that I had after my 
interview here, because I thought, these people

08:04.064 --> 08:21.749
know how it's done. And the positive reaction came 
largely from two men, Al Kronk, who was then the

08:24.087 --> 08:43.345
head of the Aerospace Department, and above all, 
Harry Whitmore, who had just come in, I think, in,

08:24.087 --> 08:43.345
what, 63, I think, just a year before, to head up the 
Space Technology Division, so-called.

08:44.226 --> 08:53.335
Now, I'm going to make some comments here that 
would appear to be critical of Al Kronk, but they

08:44.226 --> 08:53.335
should not be interpreted that way. He was and 
still is, although he's in poor health now, a hell

08:54.209 --> 09:02.898
of a guy. And I really came to love that man. 
However, Al was like so many of our engineering

09:07.442 --> 09:17.152
department heads back in those days in that he was 
not research-oriented. He did not promote

09:18.434 --> 09:21.837
research. push faculty to do research. Texas 
A&M's image back in the 50s, I think, although I was

09:26.105 --> 09:41.722
not here, but I think it was one of a super 
undergraduate educational institution. And in

09:43.864 --> 09:52.093
the engineering, it turned out people that were 
very well equipped to go into industry and do the

09:52.360 --> 09:56.306
job.

09:57.768 --> 10:16.494
But as I say, when Mr. Rutter came aboard in 58, I 
guess, as chancellor, I think, or president, I'm

09:57.768 --> 10:16.494
not really sure how that all happened, but he was 
the one who really started to promote research

09:57.768 --> 10:16.494
activities at Texas A&M. Well, we had As I say, we 
had a number of engineering department heads,

10:19.360 --> 10:36.466
Cliff Semang in mechanical engineering, Bob 
Whiting in petroleum engineering, and on and on,

10:19.360 --> 10:36.466
Art Burgess in industrial engineering. Great 
guys, super teachers, super educators, but

10:36.486 --> 10:45.520
researchers,

10:36.486 --> 10:45.520
no. Quite honestly, it was always my perception, 
nobody ever told me this, but it was always my

10:46.293 --> 11:03.120
perception that the Space Technology Division 
and Mr. Whitmore were set up to, well, one might say

10:46.293 --> 11:03.120
to go around Alcron. in the matter of research. And 
I suppose that wouldn't be too far off base. But

11:08.149 --> 11:22.432
really, it was more to supplement what Professor 
Cronk was doing in the educational arena and get a

11:08.149 --> 11:22.432
very definite research thrust going. And it was 
clear to me when I came down here in the spring of 64,

11:31.838 --> 11:38.786
that

11:31.838 --> 11:38.786
TEAS had money to spend in the promotion of 
research. And above all, they knew what that

11:39.988 --> 11:44.773
meant. And this had just a tremendous impact on me. 
Because I had determined, although I looked at

11:50.320 --> 11:59.230
industry initially when I decided to leave Ohio 
State, I had determined I was going to stay in the

11:59.446 --> 12:06.332
academic

11:59.446 --> 12:06.332
ranks. And I went over, well, among the 
institutions that I interviewed was Georgia

12:06.352 --> 12:13.238
Tech. And they had a pretty good research program. 
But I was absolutely turned off by their attitude.

12:21.205 --> 12:23.347
They wanted me to promote research. They wanted me 
to hustle more. And I said to them, well, do you have

12:28.572 --> 12:34.240
money to travel, you know, to go visit research 
farms? And they said, well, you can take that out of

12:34.260 --> 12:37.644
your research money. I said, wait a minute. You 
can't, you know, you're asking me to pull myself up

12:40.368 --> 12:45.435
by my brood straps. You've got to prime the pump a 
bit here, you know. And it was clear they weren't

12:49.340 --> 12:53.826
all that willing to do that. But Mr. Whitmore and 
Tease were willing. And he understood. And

12:59.749 --> 13:11.604
keep in mind, of course, not a lot of that credit 
goes to Fred Benson because he understands, too,

12:59.749 --> 13:11.604
what is involved in building a program. And it's 
something that you just don't do overnight. So

13:16.470 --> 13:26.743
they understood that in the promotion of 
research, one does not sit down and write out a

13:26.926 --> 13:39.663
proposal, however technically excellent it 
might be, and send it to the sponsor, the potential

13:26.926 --> 13:39.663
sponsor, and say, send money by return made. It 
just does not happen that way. You must go there.

13:44.789 --> 13:46.391
You must sell yourself.

13:49.455 --> 13:50.376
You have to hustle. And that, to some, is sort of the 
senior side of academia. But you've got to do it.

13:58.970 --> 14:03.373
And there's just no substitute for having support 
of that type.

14:06.276 --> 14:16.524
And I think that having the Research Foundation, 
of course, was a great asset, too, because there

14:06.276 --> 14:16.524
you could get a professional-looking proposal 
turned out. Obviously, they, coupled with TEAS,

14:17.605 --> 14:25.212
would help you manage your project, your money, 
once you got it. And that's essential. When I went,

14:27.406 --> 14:45.829
again, just to illustrate the counterpoint, when 
I went to the University of Maryland, again, I went

14:27.406 --> 14:45.829
into a department, if you can believe this, 20 
minutes from downtown Washington, where many of

14:27.406 --> 14:45.829
the research sponsors were located. And again, 
when I went to Maryland, that department had

14:45.849 --> 14:52.958
knocked anyone in research when I went there. And 
they did not have an engineering expert station.

14:56.592 --> 14:59.575
They did not have a research foundation. And I 
lucked out and rather quickly got a nice grant from

14:59.595 --> 15:05.783
NASA to do some wind tunnel studies. And I had to 
hire a gal into the department office there to keep

15:06.544 --> 15:13.973
books on this project. You know, the various sorts 
of things that the research foundation and MTs do

15:14.814 --> 15:21.983
for me. Well, that kind of support, you see, is just 
of inestimable value in the promotion of

15:22.790 --> 15:32.026
research. And so all of that infrastructure was 
here. And of course, Ohio State had had a very

15:36.394 --> 15:40.962
strong research foundation. Their engineering 
experiment station was nothing like this one

15:40.982 --> 15:46.772
here. So I had some appreciation of what these 
support institutions could do for you. And that

15:54.519 --> 15:56.882
was all here, and that was all in place. And to have 
that, you see, coupled with Mr. Whitmore's

15:57.423 --> 16:09.781
attitude, you know, yeah, I got some money for you, 
and if you need help, you come see me. And it was just

16:10.562 --> 16:15.409
too good to pass up. Of course, I'd have to say that 
there were some other factors involved in coming

16:15.811 --> 16:24.120
to Texas A&M. I was born and raised in small towns, 
and so I liked the kind of small town atmosphere.

16:33.290 --> 16:39.757
And I liked the attitude of the people, and I 
thought it was a good place to raise my kids. And so

16:39.837 --> 16:42.460
that, too, was a major concern. But in terms of Dick 
Thomas' professional development, I don't think

16:43.132 --> 16:58.014
I could have found, and frankly, I tell young 
people today, I don't think they could find today

16:43.132 --> 16:58.014
any better atmosphere. Although the teaching 
loans, of course, have increased substantially

16:58.574 --> 17:03.301
in recent years. And that's, I know, a very 
negative factor in recruiting people. But in

17:06.926 --> 17:12.835
terms of promoting research, it's difficult to 
find a better environment, a better atmosphere in

17:13.658 --> 17:19.867
which to do that. So T's contributed heavily, I 
think, to the elevation of Texas A&M's image as a

17:19.927 --> 17:30.083
research institution. We've still got a ways to 
go, but when you look When you look, when you

17:33.824 --> 17:40.451
consider the, what, 25, 26 years since Mr. Rudder 
took over and set us on this path, and if you look

17:40.651 --> 17:51.242
back at what we've accomplished in those 25 years, 
it's really quite incredible. It really is. A lot

17:52.163 --> 17:57.508
of people don't appreciate that, but he's 
contributed heavily to that. When you first came,

17:57.528 --> 18:02.613
was the wind tunnel still housing hay? Was it still 
what? Was it still a hay barn? Well, not quite.

18:08.050 --> 18:10.293
Almost.

18:12.817 --> 18:22.512
That brings back a lot of

18:12.817 --> 18:22.512
memories.

18:25.597 --> 18:42.536
The wind tunnel was there and had recently, that 
is, I say recently, but I think, I'm not sure when it

18:25.597 --> 18:42.536
was, I think in the late 50s and early 60s, had been 
upgraded because initially it was an open circuit

18:25.597 --> 18:42.536
or an open throat type wind tunnel. And that, you 
just have difficulty doing precise research in a

18:42.596 --> 18:49.985
facility like that. And so they had put in the, they 
had closed it, they had put in the return leg And Joe

18:55.398 --> 19:10.197
Bruce and his crew had just done a magnificent job 
of going in and ferreting out sources of

18:55.398 --> 19:10.197
turbulence and instability in the tunnel. And 
they had put in the balance to measure forces on

19:10.217 --> 19:15.323
models.

19:19.569 --> 19:23.734
But it had kind of fallen on hard times. Because I 
think, although they had put in the balance, they

19:24.541 --> 19:42.284
did not put in a data system, a system that would 
more or less automatically

19:24.541 --> 19:42.284
process the data coming out of the balance and out 
of the wind tunnel. And I don't know whether that

19:42.304 --> 19:45.808
was, well, there was another problem, too. I 
should back up here a bit and say, as you've

19:47.090 --> 19:53.198
probably already been told by others, It was hoped 
that by upgrading the tunnel that it could do, it

19:53.482 --> 20:10.359
could support itself with a lot of commercial 
testing for people like LTV and General Dynamics

19:53.482 --> 20:10.359
and others. And it also, of course, it would 
provide a basis for some good aerodynamic

20:11.360 --> 20:18.848
research. Well, at about that time, for whatever 
reason,

20:20.009 --> 20:34.666
General Dynamics started building its own wind 
tunnel facilities, and other organizations did

20:20.009 --> 20:34.666
too. And I think that, coupled with the fact that we 
weren't really equipped to do commercial

20:34.846 --> 20:48.362
processing of wind tunnel data, commercial 
testing,

20:49.793 --> 21:02.769
It just led to the circumstance that occurred when 
I came in, and that was that the wind tunnel had been

20:49.793 --> 21:02.769
shut down, basically, and we're just sitting 
there gathering dust. And so to that extent, it was

21:03.470 --> 21:11.160
a big one.

21:12.929 --> 21:24.239
I remember one of the first groups of students that 
I had, one of the first courses I taught that dealt

21:12.929 --> 21:24.239
with low-speed aerodynamics. And so I went to Mr. 
Cronk and Mr. Whitmore and I said, can we use the

21:24.259 --> 21:35.690
wind tunnel for some student demonstrations? And 
so I took a bunch of students out there And down in

21:42.190 --> 21:48.299
the basement of the tunnel, we found a big box that 
looked rather like a coffin. But in that box, we

21:48.319 --> 21:51.123
found a model, a wind tunnel model. And it had been, 
it was a

21:51.804 --> 22:05.803
Temco, that's the T in LTV, used to be LTV. And 
Temco, back, I don't know, back in the 50s, was

22:10.996 --> 22:20.545
preparing a bid on the development and production 
of a cargo airplane for the Air Force or something.

22:20.565 --> 22:40.024
And they had this model, and apparently they were 
unsuccessful in their bid, and then of course were

22:20.565 --> 22:40.024
then absorbed by Ling and his operation, and 
apparently never took the model back. With

22:40.747 --> 22:49.759
the traditional Aggie enthusiasm, my students 
tore into that thing. They assembled the model. We

22:53.084 --> 22:58.631
installed it in the wind tunnel with Mr. Bruce's 
invaluable assistance. And we ran a series of

22:58.651 --> 23:01.756
tests on that model. And again, this was just 
principally for the educational

23:01.776 --> 23:08.745
enlightenment of the students. But we sort of blew 
the dust out of the tunnel at that time, and I guess

23:09.451 --> 23:31.772
it was through that experience that

23:09.451 --> 23:31.772
I became convinced that it was a fine facility, 
excellent flow characteristics in it, again, due

23:09.451 --> 23:31.772
to Mr. Bruce's careful work. And I thought it I 
thought it was possible to do some research with

23:36.029 --> 23:42.438
it. And although it was out of my area, I was trained 
principally in hypersonic aerodynamics and

23:42.458 --> 23:52.371
reentry processes. So I was not and am not a 
low-speed

23:52.391 --> 23:58.800
guy. But I learned to fly during World War II, and I 
still enjoy flying. And so to that extent, I'm

24:02.104 --> 24:05.108
interested in low-speed. because the airplanes I 
fly don't go very fast. And I had done some crop

24:09.228 --> 24:15.878
testing and things

24:09.228 --> 24:15.878
like that. So we were fortunate then in the 
mid-'60s to get some work for NASA, from NASA, for

24:15.898 --> 24:27.855
work in the wind tunnel. But here again, you see, I 
well remember a trip that I took to NASA Langley

24:29.371 --> 24:38.683
after having done what groundwork I could do by 
phone. And I went up there and talked to a guy who

24:40.345 --> 24:54.923
eventually became a very good friend, Jerry 
Rainey, and essentially convinced him that he

24:40.345 --> 24:54.923
ought to give some money to Texas A&M. And you see, 
if I'd been at Georgia Tech, for example, or some

24:56.017 --> 25:07.757
other institution that didn't have that support 
for you, it would have just been impossible.

25:08.698 --> 25:11.663
And there was another element to that, 
incidentally. Thinking back on it, the Aero

25:12.419 --> 25:18.645
Department has a small wind tunnel, a two foot by 
three foot, I think it is. Yeah, I've seen that.

25:19.966 --> 25:24.010
That's not anywhere near the same wind tunnel. 
Right. However, we were doing some work on dust

25:24.991 --> 25:27.954
generators. We were proposing for Langley to do 
some work on dust generators. And we built a little

25:34.401 --> 25:37.684
prototype of our dust generator. and put it in that 
tunnel in that small tunnel to prove the concept

25:38.693 --> 26:07.198
and uh and that that construction of that little 
prototype was done with t's money and i'm sure that

25:38.693 --> 26:07.198
when i went to see mr rainey at langley and i showed 
him i said you know here we we did we did a little very

25:38.693 --> 26:07.198
crude improvisation of what we wanted to do in the 
big tunnel and uh And he was impressed with that.

26:10.978 --> 26:18.809
And so here, this is just the way, just the way T's, 
the T's work, you see, the T's money works. Just

26:19.390 --> 26:23.296
absolutely invaluable. When you came back in 71,

26:23.316 --> 26:30.546
did you become involved in the shuttle research? 
In what? Shuttle research? No, no. What were you

26:33.751 --> 26:34.933
doing? When I... You see, in 1970 or, well, 69,

26:38.971 --> 26:53.313
when Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon, the space 
program started downhill. And also, for the first

26:54.474 --> 27:05.771
time in history, all three of the support areas 
generally active in aerospace engineering went

26:54.474 --> 27:05.771
downhill. That is, aerospace engineering in the 
60s and so forth, 70s, rested on a three-legged

27:08.671 --> 27:15.477
stool. One is commercial and general aviation. 
Another one is military aviation, and the third is

27:20.302 --> 27:23.985
space. And generally, in times past, those things 
would not be synchronized. That is, if one went

27:31.071 --> 27:36.096
down, one of the other would be going up, and things 
were relatively balanced. Well, in the late 60s

27:37.223 --> 27:46.862
and early 70s, for the first time in history, they 
all, three, went down together. And it was not a

27:47.022 --> 27:52.353
good time for an aerospace engineer to be out 
looking for a job.

27:55.098 --> 27:59.687
Research money had dried up.

28:04.088 --> 28:11.457
The student enrollments went down in the early 70s 
because engineers couldn't get jobs. It was a

28:11.477 --> 28:13.599
tough situation. The department over here had 
more faculty than it needed. And Dr. Norton and

28:19.987 --> 28:28.577
others will tell you, Jim Strickland, when he was 
alive and was here, they were urged to go out and

28:29.266 --> 28:36.773
hustle the research money in order to keep 
themselves afloat financially. Because I think

28:36.793 --> 28:48.283
by 1973 or 4, I think the total number of graduates 
out of the department was something like

28:36.793 --> 28:48.283
20. Just, boy, it dried up and hurt. And so when I 
came back then,

28:59.303 --> 29:17.967
Mr. Benson put me in a position as a special 
assistant to him with the task of simply promoting

28:59.303 --> 29:17.967
some new research for the 14s and for the College of 
Engineering. And I did not, as a matter of fact, my

29:18.167 --> 29:28.180
title at that time, my academic title was 
professor of engineering, not professor of

29:18.167 --> 29:28.180
aerospace engineering. And so it was only later on 
when the enrollments came back that I got involved

29:28.902 --> 29:41.319
again with the aero

29:28.902 --> 29:41.319
department. And so, no, I had not anything to do 
with the shuttle test. I think the only thing I

29:48.248 --> 29:58.622
could claim credit for was that prior to those 
tests, we did get the wind tunnel back in

29:48.248 --> 29:58.622
operation. And we had a going facility. And then, 
of course, NASA came in and bought us a data system,

30:01.816 --> 30:11.432
bought us a computer to do the processing. And 
that's the kind of a facility we should have had

30:11.672 --> 30:15.238
back in the early 60s. Did they have those types of 
things developed in the early 60s? Mm-hmm. Yeah.

30:20.928 --> 30:23.892
Yeah, they were mostly analog computers. We had 
one in Ohio State

30:23.932 --> 30:32.464
in the 1950s, and other facilities had them too. 
Nothing like what you have today. But yeah, they

30:35.949 --> 30:47.745
had facilities that made

30:35.949 --> 30:47.745
it possible to look at the data very quickly. And 
that was the big problem. You see, when a guy runs a

30:50.244 --> 30:55.535
wind tunnel test, he wants the results right now. 
Because, of course, oftentimes he'll look at the

30:56.918 --> 31:01.127
data And depending on the way that looks and his 
interpretation of that, that will determine what

31:01.883 --> 31:09.775
the next test is going to be. Well, you see, the 
setup they had in the late 50s and early 60s was such

31:09.795 --> 31:19.811
that they could take data in a very raw form. And 
they had to bring it into the DPC, punch it into

31:19.831 --> 31:25.399
CARBs, and then process it. And so, shoot, you were 
lucky if you got it the next day. And, of course,

31:30.773 --> 31:35.759
those guys wanted, you know, the sponsors wanted 
it right now. And that was the problem. When you

31:38.903 --> 31:51.558
came back as the assistant,

31:38.903 --> 31:51.558
were other departments besides aerospace

31:38.903 --> 31:51.558
having, were other departments having trouble 
getting research money too? Was there a slope in

31:52.059 --> 31:53.961
the others? Oh, no, dear, I don't think I'd say 
that.

32:00.878 --> 32:13.373
Well, incidentally, we're skipping over some 
other things here that occurred in the late 60s

32:00.878 --> 32:13.373
that would involve T's, and I guess we ought to come 
back and talk about those. But because, you see, we

32:13.393 --> 32:29.232
haven't talked about the flight lab, we haven't 
talked about the shock tube, both of which were –

32:13.393 --> 32:29.232
resulted totally from what T's did.

32:30.207 --> 32:32.530
But to answer your question, no. In the 60s

32:35.294 --> 32:48.854
and 70s,

32:35.294 --> 32:48.854
there was a general push toward the hiring of 
faculty that had research capabilities. And so

32:48.874 --> 32:59.910
just as I had been hired into Arrow to promote a 
research

32:48.874 --> 32:59.910
program, they had attempted and had been 
successful in hiring other people in other

33:00.717 --> 33:04.821
departments. And so

33:04.841 --> 33:16.292
I think Texas A&M was moving ahead on a fairly broad 
front

33:04.841 --> 33:16.292
in research. Now, these were mainly in what you 
might call the traditional areas of research. And

33:23.779 --> 33:30.285
so when I came back,

33:31.750 --> 33:47.905
I had a conversation, or before I came back, I had a 
conversation with Mr. Benson, a conversation I

33:31.750 --> 33:47.905
would never forget, wherein he outlined for me 
what he thought he wanted me to do. And

33:47.925 --> 33:52.109
incidentally, I was not an assistant dean at that 
point. I was a special assistant to the dean. And so

33:57.094 --> 34:01.538
it was purely a research endeavor. I had no 
academic functions and I didn't work with

34:01.889 --> 34:07.976
students at all. But Mr. Benson, and of course it 
will be clear to you that I revere that man greatly.

34:21.512 --> 34:31.204
A lot of people think that he's kind of a staid 
thinker,

34:21.512 --> 34:31.204
you know, doesn't have much outreach. looking for 
new ideas, and nothing could be further from the

34:31.454 --> 34:38.385
truth. Because, and here again,

34:38.405 --> 34:46.938
this was kind of a typical Tease operation. He just 
simply wanted me to find some new areas in which

34:46.978 --> 34:59.217
Tease and the College of Engineering could work, 
non-traditional

34:46.978 --> 34:59.217
areas. And as far as he was concerned,

35:01.070 --> 35:10.901
I had carte blanche to move in any direction I 
wanted to move in. It was as if he had given me a

35:10.921 --> 35:19.610
little chunk of money, which he did, and said, in 
effect, here, go do something great with this. And

35:19.630 --> 35:25.356
it was absolutely one of the most exhilarating 
experiences I ever had in my life. And he just ran

35:26.568 --> 35:33.514
some things by me the way he was thinking. He said 
that

35:33.794 --> 35:48.327
he thought that, of course, keep in mind we were in 
the midst of the Vietnam debacle

35:33.794 --> 35:48.327
at that time. And he said, for the first time in 
history, our technology has failed us in Vietnam.

35:56.977 --> 36:03.425
Of course, we know now why that happened. But he 
suggested that we might do a piece of research

36:03.445 --> 36:19.226
looking at why technology failed, or if 
technology had failed in Vietnam, and if it had,

36:03.445 --> 36:19.226
why it had. That blew my mind. It, of course, would 
have been a tremendously interesting piece of

36:22.089 --> 36:26.595
research And I nosed into it a little bit to find out 
that at that point there was so much stonewalling

36:27.605 --> 36:35.417
going on. And, of course, you have to get access to 
classified

36:35.437 --> 36:42.387
information. And so we didn't pursue that very 
much. He was very concerned about advanced

36:46.473 --> 36:51.040
transportation systems. And that kind of 
surprised me because, of course, he had been the

36:51.060 --> 36:55.907
founder of TTI. and uh but he was concerned that tti 
was not reaching out far enough and they were too

36:56.579 --> 37:24.679
content to sit here doing highway research i mean 
good stuff don't misunderstand good stuff but but

36:56.579 --> 37:24.679
research that was again pretty traditional stuff 
and at that time you know there was great interest

36:56.579 --> 37:24.679
in some of these people mover systems and the

37:25.621 --> 37:33.430
things like the Air Trans of Dallas, the DFW 
airport, unmanned, automated kinds of systems.

37:35.272 --> 37:41.479
And he thought we ought to be getting into that. And 
so we did mount some efforts in

37:41.499 --> 37:47.546
that direction. The whole issue of productivity. 
was beginning to emerge then. And that later

37:53.265 --> 38:08.878
developed into a fairly substantial program, of 
course, trying to find ways to use new technology

37:53.265 --> 38:08.878
to increase the efficiency of manufacturing and 
production within the United States. So still, of

38:08.898 --> 38:13.342
course, a very, very hot issue. And I think it's a 
tribute to Mr. Benson that he saw that coming down

38:13.362 --> 38:19.607
the road.

38:21.393 --> 38:40.415
So as I say, he just

38:21.393 --> 38:40.415
wanted me to sort of follow my nose and try to 
develop some new research areas for the Four Keys

38:21.393 --> 38:40.415
and for the College of Engineering. So that was my 
assignment

38:40.435 --> 38:44.920
when I came back. You said productivity developed 
into big studies, but here, what group was it that

38:50.148 --> 38:54.052
was doing this? Well, there wasn't any group doing

38:54.072 --> 39:01.179
it at the time. So the people that we drew on to 
develop that program were folks out of industrial

39:01.199 --> 39:13.793
engineering and I guess principally out of IT. 
There were some other folks in ME and EE that were

39:13.813 --> 39:19.058
interested. but the involvement principally 
came out of that. But the thrust of that, as it

39:26.101 --> 39:37.077
turned out, was, well, I guess there were two 
things. One major thrust dealt with technology

39:38.038 --> 39:42.865
transfer. Now, that has a different connotation 
today than it did then, those words. uh nowadays

39:48.198 --> 40:18.137
when you say technology transfer generally 
people are talking about the movement of

39:48.198 --> 40:18.137
technology from the u.s to the soviet union which 
is an interesting and vital question but back in

39:48.198 --> 40:18.137
those days it had to do with what might better be 
called the diffusion of technology that is to say

39:48.198 --> 40:18.137
one of the things we studied dealt with 
numerically controlled machines These are

40:18.640 --> 40:27.942
machine tools, lathes, milling machines, and so 
forth, that early on were controlled what you

40:28.934 --> 40:32.300
might call a very crude computer. But it was a 
numerical system, an automated system, really

40:32.740 --> 40:43.598
based on punched paper tapes, paper tape with 
holes in it that contained signals that would

40:32.740 --> 40:43.598
guide the machine. And so instead of having a 
machinist sit there with his eye twisting the

40:44.280 --> 40:50.169
knobs very carefully, it's open. It was all 
automated. If you went up to General Dynamics, for

40:53.909 --> 41:04.839
example, and Vaught, and other aerospace 
manufacturers, for example, you'd find lots of NC

40:53.909 --> 41:04.839
machines. You'd go to Hughes Tool, or Cameron 
Ironworks, or some of the smaller machine shops

41:05.840 --> 41:18.673
that populate Houston and Dallas, you'd find 
nothing, or very little. Which indicated that for

41:19.573 --> 41:22.296
some reason or other, That technology had not 
diffused, had not moved through American

41:22.732 --> 41:29.971
industry. And the belief was, quite properly, 
that if we could do that, if we could somehow

41:30.813 --> 41:39.576
stimulate that, that we could help industry 
increase its productivity. become more

41:40.282 --> 41:44.326
efficient, become more competitive with Japan 
and Germany. So that was the general move. It

41:48.450 --> 41:54.476
headed much toward the manufacturing. Was there a 
particular

41:54.496 --> 41:59.962
center or division established to handle this? 
No. No. It never evolved into that. We just simply

42:04.427 --> 42:09.732
called it the Productivity Program.

42:12.175 --> 42:19.604
And we had a problem emerge there, quite honestly, 
that we still have today.

42:21.786 --> 42:29.696
And this is, I guess here I'm going, I'm about to 
utter my first critical remark of Teed's.

42:36.223 --> 42:37.525
The kinds of work that I was attempting to promote 
there, as I've already indicated, was

42:38.737 --> 42:44.123
interdisciplinary. That is to say, we needed to 
get industrial, mechanical, and electrical

42:44.323 --> 42:52.371
engineers involved. The reward system as it is set 
up now, and TEAS has been part of this, is one

42:52.391 --> 43:08.608
wherein a department head and a faculty member is 
credited, literally credited, with the money he

43:09.466 --> 43:11.670
brings to his department.

43:14.335 --> 43:28.440
And if a guy, let's suppose that a program is 
focused in some external center, in this center,

43:14.335 --> 43:28.440
for example, we still have this problem. If I get a 
half million dollars to do a piece of research, And

43:35.082 --> 43:43.151
I go to mechanical engineering and industrial 
engineering and any engineering department. And

43:43.171 --> 43:49.617
I pull simply because the work is attractive. I 
get, say, three professors, one from each one of

43:49.637 --> 43:54.422
those departments, to work with me on the project. 
They didn't get any credit for that.

44:00.309 --> 44:03.452
And...

44:04.242 --> 44:18.840
A portion, you know, although they would deserve, 
the department would be, would deserve credit for

44:04.242 --> 44:18.840
a portion of that money that I've gotten because I 
got the money based on the capabilities that exist

44:04.242 --> 44:18.840
over there, you see. But the way the reward 
structure is set up, it doesn't address that. And

44:26.570 --> 44:31.836
so that's a real severe problem that, as I say, 
exists today. and tease, and I've bitched at Dr.

44:32.204 --> 44:48.289
Porter and others about this, and

44:32.204 --> 44:48.289
they nod every time I complain, and say, oh yes, 
here's Thomas in his usual gripe. But it is a real

44:49.711 --> 44:51.153
severe problem. So the productivity program 
never really blossomed. And the reason that it

45:00.132 --> 45:08.463
didn't blossom was that when I got some money, we 
got some money from the National Science

45:00.132 --> 45:08.463
Foundation. Industrial Engineering took their 
little chunk of money and went back to Industrial

45:08.483 --> 45:16.914
Engineering and did their little thing and they 
said to hell with these other guys. And I was just

45:17.876 --> 45:30.072
absolutely unable to

45:17.876 --> 45:30.072
bring any kind of an interdisciplinary effort

45:30.659 --> 45:45.263
And so

45:30.659 --> 45:45.263
there's a real problem there that somehow, 
someway, we have to surmount.

45:45.583 --> 45:46.865
And it's not an easy thing. And Texas A&M and TEAS is 
not the only one that has that problem. It's a

45:51.052 --> 45:55.339
universal

45:51.052 --> 45:55.339
problem. But the productivity...
