00:03.560 --> 00:10.580
This is Debra Beale and I am interviewing Dr. 
Richard Thomas on the history of the Texas

00:03.560 --> 00:10.580
Engineering Experiment Station. The date is June 
15th, 1984. ...section on here already, so tell us

00:14.560 --> 00:19.580
who you are. I'd like to

00:19.560 --> 00:26.460
put some background on your education and how you 
came down here. Well, I wouldn't say how far back in

00:26.440 --> 00:30.301
it. You talked about university education in 
Richmond. I did all my work up at Ohio State,

00:33.660 --> 00:43.940
finished, or left there rather, in 64. My

00:43.920 --> 01:01.070
background is basically aerospace engineering, 
that's where my PhD is, but also studied

01:01.050 --> 01:06.890
mathematics and math too. But I was brought into 
the Department of Aerospace Engineering here

01:06.870 --> 01:14.390
back in 1964. You were gone for a few years, right? 
Yeah, I made the mistake of leaving Texas A&M at one

01:17.370 --> 01:23.390
time. I was offered a job as a department head at 
Maryland and left and went up there. My

01:31.560 --> 01:42.410
family and I discovered that some hard-bitten old 
Midwestern conservatives didn't fit well into

01:42.390 --> 01:48.410
the heartland of the liberal eastern 
establishment. And... And it was really

01:48.390 --> 01:52.880
principally Washington. It wasn't the 
University of Maryland. I enjoyed the university

01:54.390 --> 02:00.320
and had a great time there. But it was just the 
general mood and environment of Washington, D.C.

02:00.300 --> 02:08.760
itself that we didn't fit into. And so after we were 
there a couple of years, I determined that I had

02:08.740 --> 02:14.760
made a mistake and

02:14.740 --> 02:22.540
taken the family there and decided to go 
elsewhere. And I actually was pursuing some jobs

02:22.520 --> 02:30.730
in some other areas. And I thought, well, I would 
contact Fred Benson, who was dean here. And he was

02:36.890 --> 02:43.910
kind enough to offer me an opportunity to come back 
to Texas A&M. And so we did come back then in the

02:43.890 --> 02:47.910
early 70s. That was a right move, incidentally. 
When you first came here, what type of research was

02:51.460 --> 02:56.480
going on? Well, that's a very relevant question 
regarding the history and general impact of TEAS.

03:05.540 --> 03:16.720
Because

03:05.540 --> 03:16.720
within the Aero Department, there wasn't any 
research

03:05.540 --> 03:16.720
going on. Mr. Rutter was our president then. He 
recognized that research was key to the image of an

03:18.700 --> 03:30.540
institution that aspired to greatness. But

03:30.520 --> 03:36.210
any of the so-called... Great universities,

03:37.190 --> 03:52.610
their reputation is built more on their research 
than on their academic programs. In my view, the

03:52.590 --> 03:57.730
undergraduate program at MIT, for example, is 
rather pedestrian. And I just assumed if I had a

03:57.710 --> 04:03.290
student who wanted to study... A son who wanted to 
study aerospace engineering, I'd just...

04:06.270 --> 04:09.290
Frankly, I'd rather have him here than MIT. And 
when you get into graduate work, that's something

04:09.270 --> 04:12.290
else again. It's a different story. But it is 
research that... That

04:16.270 --> 04:21.500
makes the image of an institution. I

04:21.480 --> 04:28.050
once heard that Mr. Rutter had said, I don't know 
whether it's true or not, that he was going to make

04:28.030 --> 04:32.580
Texas A&M the MIT of the Southwest, or I guess that 
would also mean possibly make MIT the Texas A&M of

04:32.560 --> 04:37.580
the Northeast or something, although they'd have 
to go a bit to do that. But

04:40.560 --> 04:49.970
it was clear that when I was hired here in 64, they 
didn't ask whether I could teach or not. They were

04:54.870 --> 05:01.640
interested in the fact that I had been involved in a 
very active research program, and above all, I

05:01.620 --> 05:06.070
knew how to hustle money and

05:06.050 --> 05:13.230
convince sponsors that they ought to give me money 
for research. There wasn't any... It was...

05:16.640 --> 05:24.230
That's what I was supposed to do. Because, as I say, 
when I came into the aerial department, as I

05:27.210 --> 05:39.100
recall,

05:27.210 --> 05:39.100
there was not anyone at that

05:27.210 --> 05:39.100
time. Now, they had had some off and on, but there 
wasn't any... There wasn't any large, consistent

05:43.770 --> 05:49.060
program. You did mostly aeronautical research 
versus aerospace, too. Well, it wasn't even...

05:55.710 --> 05:58.730
No, I don't make any distinction there. Oh, okay. 
Yeah. Now, shortly after I came here, there was

06:00.960 --> 06:07.220
another group within AERO and coupled with ME that 
had a piece of research dealing with propeller

06:07.200 --> 06:17.540
thrust studies.

06:17.520 --> 06:34.410
And I'm sure they would have gotten that,

06:17.520 --> 06:34.410
had...

06:34.390 --> 06:42.420
That was the directive that was given to

06:34.390 --> 06:42.420
me. And... But did it change much between the time 
you came and... No. No. It hasn't

06:52.560 --> 07:04.710
changed all that much today. Now, the structure 
has changed a bit. It was what it is now and what it

07:08.160 --> 07:15.530
was then.

07:15.510 --> 07:29.160
And this gets into some of the personnel changes 
that were in since 64.

07:29.140 --> 07:30.231
I cannot... I cannot overemphasize the 
importance of TEA. In that whole process. And as a

07:36.480 --> 07:41.500
matter of fact, the importance of TEA's in my 
decision to come to Texas A&M. And

07:41.480 --> 07:49.290
if you want to get into that now, we can. But it 
wasn't absolutely critical. Because quite

07:52.270 --> 07:59.390
frankly, I think if there hadn't been TEA's, I 
wouldn't have come to Texas A&M. It's that simple.

08:00.370 --> 08:15.850
And

08:00.370 --> 08:15.850
I well remember

08:00.370 --> 08:15.850
what a very positive reaction that I had after

08:00.370 --> 08:15.850
my interview. Because I thought, these people 
know how it's done. And the positive reaction came

08:20.900 --> 08:25.920
largely from two men. Al Kronk, who was then the 
head of the Aerospace Department. And above all,

08:29.900 --> 08:31.920
Harry Whitmore. Who had just come in, I think, in 
what, 63, I think? Just a year before to head up the

08:36.900 --> 08:41.920
Space Technology Division, so-called. Now, I'm 
going to say some... Make some comments here that

08:45.210 --> 08:48.230
would appear to be critical of Al Kronk. But they 
should not be interpreted that way. He was, and

08:54.210 --> 09:02.500
still is, although he's in poor health now, a hell 
of a guy. And I really came to love that man.

09:06.480 --> 09:13.500
However, Al was like so many of our engineering 
department heads back in those days. In that he was

09:13.480 --> 09:17.500
not research-oriented. He did not promote 
research. He did not push faculty to do research.

09:26.100 --> 09:34.330
Texas A&M's image back in the 50s, I think, 
although it's not here. But I think it was one of the

09:34.310 --> 09:44.230
super undergraduate educational institutions.

09:44.210 --> 09:52.230
And in the engineering, it turned out people that 
were very well equipped to go into industry. And do

09:52.210 --> 09:54.830
the job. But as I say, when Mr. Rutter came aboard in 
about 58, I guess, as chancellor, I think, or

09:54.810 --> 10:03.780
president. I'm not really sure how that all 
happened. But he was the one who really started to

10:06.760 --> 10:17.180
promote research activities at Texas A&M. Well, 
we had, as I say, we had a number of engineering

10:17.160 --> 10:23.180
department heads. Cliff Semang in mechanical 
engineering. Bob Whiting in petroleum

10:27.160 --> 10:29.180
engineering. And on and on. Burgess in industrial 
engineering. Great guys. Super teachers. Super

10:38.940 --> 10:41.450
educators. But researchers,

10:41.470 --> 10:49.500
quite honestly, it was always my perception. 
Nobody ever told me this. But it was always my

10:50.480 --> 10:58.060
perception that the space technology division 
and Mr. Whitmore were set up. To, well, one might

10:58.040 --> 11:04.420
say to go around Al Kronk. And I suppose, you know, 
that wouldn't be too far off base. But really it was

11:07.400 --> 11:16.340
more to supplement what was Kronk, what Professor 
Kronk was doing in the educational arena. And get a

11:16.320 --> 11:21.190
very definite research thrust going. To

11:21.170 --> 11:38.900
me, when I came down here in the spring of 64, TEAS

11:21.170 --> 11:38.900
had money to spend in the promotion of research. 
And above all, they knew what that meant. This had

11:42.410 --> 11:50.540
just a tremendous impact on it. Because I was, I had 
determined, although I looked at industry when I

11:50.520 --> 11:57.910
decided to leave Ohio State. I had determined I was 
going to stay in the academic world. I

12:02.040 --> 12:11.400
went over, well, among the institutions that I 
interviewed was Georgia Tech. And they had a

12:11.380 --> 12:15.160
pretty good research program. But I was 
absolutely turned off by their attitude. They

12:20.480 --> 12:23.500
wanted me to promote research. They wanted me to 
hustle money. And I said to them, well, do you have

12:26.050 --> 12:33.930
money to travel, you know, to go visit research 
funds? And they said, well, you can take that out of

12:33.910 --> 12:36.930
your research money. I said, wait a minute. You 
can't, you know, you're asking me to pull myself up

12:40.490 --> 12:45.370
by my boot straps. You've got to prime the pump a bit 
here, you know. And it was clear they weren't all

12:49.200 --> 12:53.980
that willing to do that. But Mr. Whitmore and TEAS. 
Were willing. And he understood. And keep in mind,

13:00.430 --> 13:05.620
of course, not a lot of that credit goes to Fred 
Benson. Because he understands, too, what is

13:05.600 --> 13:11.450
involved in building a program. And it's 
something that you just don't do overnight. So

13:16.000 --> 13:29.550
they understood that in the promotion of 
research, one does not sit down and write out a

13:16.000 --> 13:29.550
proposal. However technically excellent it 
might be. And send it to the sponsor, the potential

13:33.040 --> 13:37.210
sponsor. And say, send money by return made. It 
just does not happen that way. You must go there.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.520
You must sell yourself. You

13:46.500 --> 13:51.070
have to hustle. And that, to some, is sort of the 
senior side of academia. But you've got to do it.

13:59.080 --> 14:03.100
And there's just no substitute for having support 
of that type. And

14:03.080 --> 14:08.690
I think that, and having the Research Foundation. 
Of course, it was a great thing. Of course, it was a

14:09.670 --> 14:12.100
great asset, too. Because there you could get a 
professional-looking proposal turned out.

14:17.080 --> 14:25.020
Obviously, they, coupled with TEAS, would help 
you manage your project, your money, once you got

14:17.080 --> 14:25.020
it. And that's essential. Because when I went, 
again, just to illustrate. When I went to the

14:30.280 --> 14:34.180
University of Maryland. Again, I went into a 
department, if you can believe this, 20 minutes

14:34.160 --> 14:41.200
from downtown Washington. Where many of the 
research sponsors were located. And again, when I

14:45.810 --> 14:50.830
went to Maryland, that department had not paid 
anyone a research. And

14:50.810 --> 14:56.500
they did not have a research foundation. They did 
not have a research foundation. And I lucked out

14:59.480 --> 15:06.500
and rather quickly got a nice grant from NASA to do 
some wind tunnel studies. And I had to hire a gal

15:06.480 --> 15:12.500
into the department office there to keep books on 
this project. You know, the very sorts of things

15:12.480 --> 15:22.000
that the Research Foundation and TEAS do for you. 
Well, that kind of support, you see, is just

15:21.980 --> 15:30.540
inestimable value in the promotion of research. 
And

15:30.520 --> 15:36.010
so all of that infrastructure was here. And of 
course, Ohio State had had a very strong research

15:35.990 --> 15:40.260
foundation. Their engineering experiment 
station was nothing

15:40.240 --> 15:47.060
like this. So I had some appreciation of what these 
support institutions could do for you. And that

15:54.040 --> 15:55.621
was all here. And that was all in place. And to have 
that, you see, coupled with Mr. Whitmore's

15:57.040 --> 16:04.480
attitude. You know, yeah, I got some money for you. 
You need help. You come see me. And it was just too

16:10.680 --> 16:15.550
good to pass up. Of course, you know, I'd have to say 
that there were some other factors. And I

16:19.780 --> 16:35.270
liked the attitude of the people.

16:35.250 --> 16:51.150
But in terms

16:35.250 --> 16:51.150
of Dick Thomas' professional development, I 
don't think I could have found, and frankly, I tell

16:51.130 --> 16:58.270
young people today, I don't think they could find 
today any better atmosphere. Although the

16:58.250 --> 17:02.270
teaching loans, of course, have increased 
substantially in recent years. And that's, I

17:02.250 --> 17:06.490
know, a very negative factor in recruiting 
people. But in terms of promoting research, it's

17:06.470 --> 17:11.470
difficult to find a better atmosphere. They have 
to find a better environment, a better atmosphere

17:11.450 --> 17:18.620
in which to do that. So T's contributed heavily, I 
think, to the elevation of Texas A&M's image as a

17:18.600 --> 17:30.100
research institution. We've still got a ways to 
go. But when you look, when you consider about 26

17:32.710 --> 17:44.850
years since Mr. Rutter took over and set us on this 
path, if you look back at what we've accomplished

17:44.830 --> 17:50.540
in those 25 years, it's really quite incredible. 
It really is. A lot of people don't appreciate

17:52.324 --> 17:53.540
that. But T's contributed heavily to that. When 
you first came, was the wind tunnel still housing

17:55.520 --> 18:02.030
hay? Was it still what? Was it still a hay barn? 
Well, not quite. Almost.

18:12.670 --> 18:14.690
They know where to start. My, that brings back a lot 
of memories.

18:25.320 --> 18:32.340
The wind tunnel was there and had recently, that 
is, I say recently, but I think, I'm not sure when it

18:25.320 --> 18:32.340
was, I think in the late 50s and early 60s, had been 
upgraded. Because initially it was an open

18:35.340 --> 18:41.670
circuit or an open throat type wind tunnel. And 
that, you just have difficulty doing precise

18:41.650 --> 18:50.460
research in a facility like that. And so they had 
put in the, they had closed it, they had put in the

18:50.440 --> 18:55.490
return leg. And Joe Bruce and his crew had a 
magnificent job of ferreting out sources of

18:55.470 --> 19:09.610
turbulence and instability in the tunnel. And 
they had put in the balance to measure forces on

19:09.590 --> 19:16.360
models. And,

19:16.340 --> 19:27.370
but it had kind of fallen on hard times because I 
think, although they had put in the balance, they

19:27.350 --> 19:29.370
did not put in a data system. A system that would 
more or less automatically, excuse me,

19:29.350 --> 19:42.460
automatically

19:29.350 --> 19:42.460
process the data coming out of the balance and out 
of the wind tunnel. And I don't know whether that

19:42.440 --> 19:46.740
was, well, there was another problem too. I should 
back up here a bit and say, as you've probably

19:46.720 --> 19:53.740
already been told,

19:53.720 --> 20:05.890
it was hoped that by upgrading the tunnel could do, 
it could support itself with commercial testing

20:05.870 --> 20:10.650
for like LTD and general dynamics and others. And 
it also, of course, it would provide a basis for

20:10.630 --> 20:18.930
some good aerodynamic research. Well, at about 
that time, for whatever reason,

20:18.910 --> 20:32.580
building its own wind tunnel facilities and other 
organizations did too. And I think that, coupled

20:32.560 --> 20:49.900
with the fact that we weren't really wind tunnel

20:32.560 --> 20:49.900
data,

20:49.880 --> 20:56.100
it just led to the circumstance that occurred when 
I came in, and that was that the wind tunnel had been

20:56.080 --> 20:59.100
shut down basically. We were just sitting there 
gathering dust. And so, to that extent, it was, I

21:02.740 --> 21:17.700
think,

21:02.740 --> 21:17.700
I remember one of the first groups of students that 
I had. The first courses I taught dealt with

21:17.680 --> 21:24.180
low-speed aerodynamics. And so, I went across

21:24.160 --> 21:33.940
and used the wind tunnel for some student 
demonstrations. And

21:33.920 --> 21:44.330
so, I took a bunch of students out there, and down in 
the basement of the tunnel, we found a big box that

21:44.310 --> 21:47.330
looked rather like a coffin. But in that box, we 
found a model, a wind tunnel model. And it had been,

21:51.360 --> 22:02.760
it was a,

21:51.360 --> 22:02.760
that's the T in LinkedIn and LTV.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.020
Temco, back, I don't know, back in the 50s, was 
preparing a bid on, on the development and

22:13.000 --> 22:20.070
production of a cargo airplane for the Air Force or 
something. And they had this, this model. And

22:23.050 --> 22:27.070
apparently, they were unsuccessful in their bid. 
And, and of course, were then, were then absorbed

22:27.050 --> 22:35.220
by, and apparently never took the model back. And 
so, the traditional Aggie enthusiasm, my

22:47.910 --> 22:50.930
students tore into that thing. They assembled the 
model. We installed it in the wind tunnel with Mr.

22:52.910 --> 22:58.080
Bruce's invaluable assistance. And we ran a 
series of tests on that model. And again, this was

23:02.060 --> 23:10.070
just principally for the educational.

23:10.050 --> 23:14.070
But we sort of blew the dust out of the tunnel at that 
time. And, and I guess it was through that

23:14.050 --> 23:18.480
experience that I, I

23:18.460 --> 23:24.260
became convinced that it was a fine facility. It 
had excellent flow characteristics.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.900
And I thought it, you know, I thought it was 
possible to, to do some research. And although

23:39.880 --> 23:44.580
that, it was out of my area. I mean, I was trained 
principally in hypersonic aerodynamics

23:44.560 --> 23:58.900
and not in M number.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.900
But I learned to fly during World War II. And I still 
enjoy flying. And so, you know, to that extent, I'm

24:01.880 --> 24:03.900
interested. Because the airplanes I fly, they'll 
go. And, and I, we

24:09.360 --> 24:19.360
were fortunate then in the, in the mid-60s to, to 
get some work for NASA, from NASA, for work in the

24:26.040 --> 24:28.060
wind tunnel. But here again, you see, this, I, I 
well remember a trip that I took to NASA Langley

24:34.890 --> 24:38.910
after having done what groundwork I could do by 
phone. And I went up there and talked to a guy who

24:38.890 --> 24:44.770
eventually became a very good friend, Jerry 
Rainey. And, and essentially convinced him that

24:47.522 --> 24:54.030
he ought to give some money to Texas A&M. And, and 
you see, if, if, if I'd been at Georgia Tech, for

24:55.010 --> 25:00.340
example, or some other institution that didn't 
have that, that support for you, it would have just

25:03.320 --> 25:06.340
been impossible. And, and there was another 
element to that, incidentally. Thinking back on

25:11.730 --> 25:17.000
it, the aero department has a small wind tunnel, a 
two foot by three foot, I think it is. Yeah, I've

25:18.980 --> 25:20.001
seen that. That's not anywhere near the same wind 
tunnel. Right. Okay. We, we were doing some work on

25:24.980 --> 25:28.000
dust genera, we were proposing for Langley to do 
some work on dust generations. And, and we built a

25:33.610 --> 25:38.720
little prototype of our dust generator and put it 
in that tunnel, in that small tunnel to prove the

25:38.700 --> 25:44.320
concept. And, and that, that construction of that 
little prototype was done with key's money. And

25:52.220 --> 25:55.240
I'm sure that when I went to see Mr. Rainey at 
Langley, and, and I showed him, I said, you know, we

25:57.220 --> 26:02.710
did a, we did a little very crude improvisation of, 
of what we wanted to do in the big tunnel.

26:08.050 --> 26:11.150
And he was impressed with that. And so here, this is 
just the way, just the way T's, the T's work, you

26:15.130 --> 26:19.550
see, the T's money works. Just absolutely 
invaluable. When you came back in 71, did, did you

26:22.960 --> 26:29.980
become involved in the shuttle research? In what? 
Shuttle research? No, no. What were you doing?

26:34.960 --> 26:44.760
When I, you see, in 1970 or, well, 69, when, when 
Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon, the space

26:48.740 --> 26:53.610
program started downhill. And also, for the first 
time in history, all three of the support areas

26:58.820 --> 27:05.960
generally active in aerospace engineering went 
downhill. That is, aerospace engineering, in the

27:07.940 --> 27:16.360
60s and so forth, 70s, rested on a three-legged 
stool. One is commercial and general aviation.

27:19.340 --> 27:24.510
Another one is military aviation and the third is 
space. And generally, in times past, those things

27:24.490 --> 27:31.300
would not be synchronized. That is, if one went 
down, one of the other would be going up, and things

27:34.280 --> 27:37.860
were relatively bad. In the late 60s and early 70s, 
for the first time in history, they all three went

27:39.840 --> 27:47.530
down together. It was not a good time for, for an 
aerospace engineer to be out looking for a job.

27:52.600 --> 27:56.460
Research money had dried up. The

27:56.440 --> 28:07.780
student enrollments went down in the early 70s 
because engineers couldn't get

28:07.760 --> 28:14.680
jobs, you know. The department over here had, had 
more faculty than it needed. Norton

28:18.660 --> 28:23.330
and others will tell you. Jim Strickland, when he 
was in the lot, they, they were urged to go out and

28:28.830 --> 28:31.850
hustle and research money in order to keep 
themselves afloat financially. Because they

28:35.830 --> 28:40.700
just, I think in, by 1973 or 4, I think the total 
number of graduates out of the department was

28:43.680 --> 28:45.700
something like 20. It

28:45.680 --> 28:51.240
had dried up incredibly. And so, when I came back, 
Mr.

28:54.530 --> 29:05.690
Benson put me in a position as a, as a special 
assistant to him with the task of simply promoting

29:08.460 --> 29:14.480
some new research for the 14s and for the College of 
Engineering. And, and I did not, as a matter of

29:16.460 --> 29:22.300
fact, my title at that time was, my academic title 
was professor of engineering, professor of

29:25.280 --> 29:27.990
aerospace engineering. And so it was only later on 
when the enrollments came back that I got a so,

29:32.460 --> 29:47.280
no, not anything to do test. Prior to

29:47.260 --> 29:55.620
those tests, we did get the wind tunnel back in 
operation and, and we had a going facility. And

30:02.550 --> 30:07.570
then, of course, NASA came in and bought us a data 
system, bought us a computer to do the, the

30:07.550 --> 30:11.490
processing. And that's the kind of a facility we 
should have had back in the, in the early 60s. Did

30:15.470 --> 30:19.490
they have those types of things developed in the 
early 60s? Yeah, they weren't, they were mostly

30:19.470 --> 30:23.220
analog computers. They were not, but yeah,

30:23.200 --> 30:39.140
they had, they had facilities that made it. And

30:39.120 --> 30:50.410
that was the

30:39.120 --> 30:50.410
big problem. You see, when a guy runs a wind tunnel 
test, he wants the results right now. Because, of

30:55.730 --> 31:00.700
course, oftentimes the look at the data, the

31:00.680 --> 31:06.150
way that looks and his interpretation of that, 
that will determine what the next test is going to

31:06.130 --> 31:09.150
be. Well, you see the, the setup they had in the late 
50s and early 60s was such that they could take data

31:13.130 --> 31:19.150
in a very raw form and they had to bring it in to the 
DPC. Punch it into CARMS and then process it the

31:21.250 --> 31:28.380
next day, you know, the sponsored movie.

31:38.600 --> 31:43.500
When you came back as the assistant, were other 
departments besides aerospace having, were

31:46.480 --> 31:52.020
other departments having trouble getting 
research money too? Was there a slope in any of the

31:52.000 --> 31:54.020
others? Oh, no, dear, I don't, I don't think I'd say 
that. Incidentally,

31:57.000 --> 32:03.120
we're skipping over some other, some other things 
here that occurred in the late 60s that, that would

32:07.100 --> 32:10.120
involve TEAS, and I guess we ought to come back and 
talk about those. Because, you see, we haven't

32:13.100 --> 32:17.380
talked about the flight lab, we haven't talked 
about the shock tube, both of which resulted

32:19.360 --> 32:30.020
totally from what TEAS did.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.020
But to answer your question, no, there, in the, in 
the 60s and 70s,

32:42.070 --> 32:46.090
there was a general push toward the hiring of 
faculty that had research capability. And so just

32:48.760 --> 32:49.781
as I had been hired in, I had been hired into Aero to, 
and had

32:51.760 --> 33:04.960
been successful in hiring other people in other 
departments. And so I think Texas A&M was moving on

33:04.940 --> 33:16.410
a fairly broad front

33:04.940 --> 33:16.410
in research. Now, these were mainly in what you 
might call the traditional.

33:23.940 --> 33:31.740
And so when I came back,

33:31.720 --> 33:33.740
I had a conversation, or before I came back, I had a 
conversation

33:33.720 --> 33:38.010
with, with a conversation I will never forget. And 
he, and incidentally, I was not an assistant dean.

33:49.660 --> 33:54.820
I was a special assistant to the dean. And so, and it 
was, and it was purely a research. It had no

34:00.650 --> 34:05.100
academic, and I didn't work with, but

34:05.080 --> 34:30.940
Mr. Benson,

34:05.080 --> 34:30.940
a lot

34:05.080 --> 34:30.940
of

34:05.080 --> 34:30.940
people think that he's a staid

34:05.080 --> 34:30.940
outreach, because,

34:30.920 --> 34:42.740
and here again, this was, this was a kind of a 
typical TEAS operation. He, he just simply wanted

34:46.710 --> 34:50.730
me to find some new areas in which, in which TEAS and 
the College of Engineering could work,

34:54.710 --> 34:59.186
non-traditional

34:54.710 --> 34:59.186
areas. And as far as he was concerned, I had carte 
blanche to move in any direction I wanted. It was as

35:08.350 --> 35:14.410
if he had given me a little chunk of money, which he 
did, and said, in effect, here, go do something

35:17.390 --> 35:19.530
great with this. And it was absolutely one of the 
most exhilarating experiences I ever had in my

35:19.510 --> 35:26.630
life. He, and he just, he just ran some things by me, 
you know, the way he was thinking. He said that he

35:33.670 --> 35:39.220
thought that, of course, keep in mind we were, we 
were in the midst of the Vietnam debacle at that

35:41.380 --> 35:49.380
time. He said, you know, for the first time in 
history, our technology has failed

35:52.360 --> 36:03.400
us. But he suggested that, that we might do a piece 
of research looking at why technology failed, or

36:11.400 --> 36:17.420
if technology had, and if it had, why it had. That, 
and I, I nosed into it a little bit to find out that,

36:31.350 --> 36:35.960
at that point, there was so much stonewalling 
going on. Of course, you had, you'd have to have

36:35.940 --> 36:40.140
access to classified data. So we didn't pursue 
that. He was very concerned about advanced

36:43.970 --> 36:50.820
transportation systems. And that kind of 
surprised me, because, of course, he had been the

36:52.800 --> 36:54.820
founder of TTIP. But

36:54.800 --> 37:01.760
he was concerned that TTI was not reaching out far 
enough, and they were too content to sit here doing

37:04.740 --> 37:06.915
highway research. I mean, good stuff, don't 
misunderstand. Good stuff, but, but research

37:10.990 --> 37:15.010
that was, again, pretty traditional stuff. And at 
that time, there was great interest in some of

37:14.990 --> 37:19.350
these people-mover systems and old

37:21.330 --> 37:29.220
things like the Air Trans up at Dallas, the DFW 
airport, you know, unmanned, automated kinds of

37:29.200 --> 37:37.600
systems.

37:37.580 --> 37:41.650
And he thought we ought to be getting into that. And 
so we, we did mount some efforts in that. The

37:44.630 --> 38:02.870
whole issue of productivity and to use new

37:44.630 --> 38:02.870
technology

38:02.850 --> 38:06.870
to increase the efficiency of manufacturing and 
production was still, of course, very, very hot to

38:06.850 --> 38:14.270
Mr. Benson, but that he saw that coming down the 
road.

38:21.080 --> 38:30.830
So, as I say, he just

38:21.080 --> 38:30.830
wanted me to sort of follow my nose and try to 
develop some new research areas for the, that was

38:40.470 --> 38:41.491
my assignment when I came here. You said 
productivity developed into being here. What

38:49.040 --> 38:52.060
group was it that was doing this? Well, there 
wasn't any group doing it at the time. And

38:55.040 --> 39:01.120
so the, well, the people that we drew on to folks out 
of industrial engineering were

39:09.030 --> 39:15.726
some other folks in M.E. and W.E. that put the 
involvement principle came out of industrial

39:16.470 --> 39:23.700
engineering. But the thrust of that, as it turned 
out, was, well, I guess there were, there were two

39:30.860 --> 39:37.640
things. One major thrust dealt with technology 
transfer. That has a different connotation today

39:43.680 --> 39:46.700
than it did then. Those words nowadays, when you 
say technology transfer, generally talk, people

39:51.500 --> 39:55.520
are talking about the movement of technology from 
the U.S. to the Soviet Union, and a vital question.

40:03.590 --> 40:08.180
But back in those days, it had to do with what might 
better be called the diffusion of technology.

40:10.160 --> 40:14.520
That is to say, one of the things we studied dealt 
with numerically controlled machines. These are

40:18.500 --> 40:23.520
machine tools, lathes, milling machines, and so 
forth, that early on were controlled by what you

40:23.500 --> 40:31.650
might call a very crude computer. It was a 
numerical system, an automated system, really

40:35.770 --> 40:38.790
based on punched paper tapes, paper tape with 
holes in it that contained signals that would

40:41.770 --> 40:43.790
guide the machine. And so instead of having a 
machinist sit there with his eye, you know,

40:46.770 --> 40:49.790
twisting the knobs very carefully and so forth, it 
was all automated. If you went up to General

40:51.770 --> 40:57.260
Dynamics, for example, and bought an aerospace 
manufacturer's, for example, you'd find lots of

41:00.550 --> 41:05.130
NC machines. You'd go to Hughes Tool or Cameron 
Ironworks or some of the smaller machine shops

41:08.580 --> 41:12.600
that populate Hughes, which

41:12.580 --> 41:21.700
indicated that, for some reason, or other, that 
technology had not diffused, had not moved

41:25.680 --> 41:30.360
through American industry. And the belief was, 
quite properly, that if we could do that, if we

41:34.340 --> 41:36.700
could somehow stimulate that, that we could help 
industry increase its productivity, become more

41:41.050 --> 41:45.070
efficient, become more competitive with Japan 
and Germany. So that was the general idea. It

41:48.460 --> 41:54.700
headed much toward the... Was there a particular 
center? No,

41:56.680 --> 42:01.260
no. It never evolved into that. We just simply 
called it the Productivity Program. And

42:06.890 --> 42:15.000
we had a problem emerge there, quite honestly, 
that we still have today. And

42:16.980 --> 42:25.520
this is, I guess, here I'm going, I'm about to utter 
my first critical remark of T's. The

42:29.500 --> 42:39.740
kinds of work that I was attempting to promote 
there, as I've already indicated, was

42:39.720 --> 42:42.740
interdisciplinary. That is to say, we needed to 
get industrial, mechanical, and electrical

42:44.640 --> 42:51.950
engineers. The reward system as it is set up now, 
and T's has been part of this, is one wherein a

42:57.930 --> 43:04.660
department head and a faculty member is credited, 
literally credited, with the money he brings to

43:09.400 --> 43:14.460
his department.

43:14.440 --> 43:20.460
And if a guy, let's suppose that a program is 
focused in some external center, in this center,

43:20.440 --> 43:25.150
for example, we still have this problem. If I get a 
half million dollars to do a piece of research, and

43:34.760 --> 43:39.780
I go to mechanical engineering and industrial 
engineering, any engineering,

43:39.760 --> 43:47.900
simply because the work is attractive, I get, say, 
three professors, one from each one of those

43:50.700 --> 43:52.720
departments, to work with me on the project. They 
don't get any credit for that. And

43:57.140 --> 44:06.880
a

43:57.140 --> 44:06.880
portion, you know, although they would deserve, 
the department would be, would deserve credit for

44:11.430 --> 44:14.450
a portion of that money that I've gotten, because I 
got the money based on the capabilities that exist

44:16.430 --> 44:18.450
over there, you see. But the way the reward 
structure is set up, it doesn't address that. And

44:24.600 --> 44:30.060
so that's a real severe problem that, as I say, 
exists. And T's, about

44:33.510 --> 44:50.940
this, and they

44:33.510 --> 44:50.940
nod every time I complain.

44:50.920 --> 45:04.090
So what the productivity program,

45:04.070 --> 45:05.091
that when I got some money, we got some money from 
the National Science Foundation, industrial

45:08.310 --> 45:11.330
engineering took their little chunk of money and 
went back to industrial engineering and did their

45:13.310 --> 45:15.330
little thing, and they said to hell with these 
other guys. And I was just absolutely unable to

45:21.400 --> 45:33.420
bring any kind of an interdisciplinary.

45:33.400 --> 45:38.720
And

45:33.400 --> 45:38.720
so there's a real problem there. But somehow, 
someway, we have to. It's

45:40.700 --> 45:46.780
not an easy thing. And Texas A&M and T's is not the 
only one that has that problem. It's a universal

45:50.760 --> 45:55.460
problem. But the productivity.
