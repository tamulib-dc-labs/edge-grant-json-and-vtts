00:03.997 --> 00:11.088
This is Deborah Beale, and I am interviewing Dr. 
Richard Thomas on the history of the Texas

00:03.997 --> 00:11.088
Engineering Experiment Station. The date is June 
15th, 1984. Factory section on here already, so

00:15.314 --> 00:27.973
tell us who you are, but I'd like to put some 
background on the history of education and how it

00:15.314 --> 00:27.973
came down here. Well, let me say how far back in it 
you talked about the university education

00:28.433 --> 00:32.299
principle. I did all my work up at Ohio State and 
left there in 1964 and came to Texas

00:33.427 --> 00:54.138
A&M at that time. My background is basically

00:54.158 --> 01:00.007
aerospace engineering. That's the area in which 
my Ph.D. is. also studied mathematics and math,

01:03.498 --> 01:07.784
too. But I was brought into the Department of 
Aerospace Engineering here back in 1964. You were

01:15.115 --> 01:18.761
gone for a few years, right? You went to Maryland? 
Yeah, yeah. I made the mistake of leaving Texas A&M

01:20.283 --> 01:31.800
at one time, and I was offered a job as a department 
head at Maryland, and left and went up there. My

01:32.995 --> 01:49.295
family and I discovered that some hard-bitten old 
Midwestern conservatives didn't fit well into

01:32.995 --> 01:49.295
the heartland of the liberal Eastern 
establishment.

01:51.117 --> 01:52.880
And it was really principally Washington. It 
wasn't the University of Maryland. I enjoyed the

01:54.902 --> 02:02.091
university

01:54.902 --> 02:02.091
and had a great time there, but it was just the of the 
general mood and environment of Washington, D.C.

02:03.421 --> 02:08.807
itself that we didn't fit into. And so after we were 
there a couple of years, I determined that I had

02:08.927 --> 02:30.829
made a mistake in

02:08.927 --> 02:30.829
taking the family there and decided to go 
elsewhere and actually was pursuing some jobs in

02:08.927 --> 02:30.829
some other areas. I thought, well, I would contact 
Fred Benson, who was deemed here. And he was kind

02:38.297 --> 02:43.924
enough to offer me an opportunity to come back to 
Texas A&M. And so we did come back then in the early

02:43.944 --> 02:50.531
70s. That was a right move, incidentally. When you 
first came here, what type of research was going

02:52.774 --> 02:56.698
on? Well, that's a very, very relevant question 
regarding the history and the impact of TEAS

02:58.028 --> 03:14.493
because

02:58.028 --> 03:14.493
within the Aero Department there wasn't any 
research going on. And, of course, Mr. Rutter was

03:14.513 --> 03:24.508
our president

03:14.513 --> 03:24.508
then, and he recognized that that research was key 
to the image of an institution that aspired to

03:25.383 --> 03:32.270
greatness.

03:34.873 --> 03:51.171
I think if we take a look at any of the so-called 
great universities, particularly

03:34.873 --> 03:51.171
technological universities like MIT or Stanford 
or Caltech or any of those, their reputation is

03:34.873 --> 03:51.171
built more on their research than on their 
academic programs. In my view, the undergraduate

03:52.113 --> 03:58.019
programs at MIT, for example, are rather 
pedestrian. And I just assumed if I had a student

03:59.580 --> 04:08.589
who wanted to study, a son who wanted to study 
aerospace engineering, I'd just, frankly, I'd

03:59.580 --> 04:08.589
rather have him here than at MIT. But when you get 
into graduate work, that's something else again.

04:11.733 --> 04:13.775
It's a different story. But it is research that 
makes the image of an institution. And I once heard

04:21.627 --> 04:32.377
that Mr. Rutter had said, I don't know whether it's 
true or not, that he was going to make Texas A&M the

04:21.627 --> 04:32.377
MIT of the Southwest. Or I guess that would also 
mean possibly make MIT the Texas A&M of the

04:32.498 --> 04:40.866
Northeast or something, although they'd have to 
go a bit to do that.

04:45.230 --> 04:49.474
But it was clear that when I was hired here in 64, 
They didn't ask whether I could teach or not. They

04:57.046 --> 05:03.916
were interested in the fact that I had been 
involved in a very active research program at Ohio

04:57.046 --> 05:03.916
State. And above all, I knew how to hustle money. I 
knew how to go out and convince sponsors that they

05:06.981 --> 05:14.411
ought to give me money for research. And there 
wasn't any, it was very clear, that when I was

05:19.559 --> 05:24.848
brought in, that's what I was supposed to do. 
Because, as I say, when I came into the Air

05:24.888 --> 05:39.713
Department, as I recall,

05:24.888 --> 05:39.713
there was not penny one of sponsored research work 
underway in that department at that time. Now,

05:39.733 --> 05:42.057
they had had some off and on. But there wasn't any 
large, consistent program. You've been mostly

05:49.107 --> 05:52.915
aeronautical research versus aerospace, too. 
Well, it wasn't even... No, I don't make any

05:52.935 --> 05:58.325
distinction there. Oh, okay. Yeah. Now, shortly 
after I came here, there was another group. within

06:05.290 --> 06:08.173
Arrow and coupled with M.E. that had a piece of 
research dealing with propeller thrust studies.

06:17.424 --> 06:26.294
And I'm sure they would have gotten that had I not 
been there.

06:33.503 --> 06:33.643
But the directive that was given to me was to go 
bring

06:34.163 --> 06:59.783
money and but did it change much between

06:34.163 --> 06:59.783
the time it came and seven no no no i don't think it i 
don't think it had changed much and uh and moreover

06:34.163 --> 06:59.783
i don't think that uh I don't think it's changed all 
that much today. Now the structure has changed a

07:04.400 --> 07:14.233
bit between what it was, what it is now, and what it 
was then.

07:15.255 --> 07:27.812
And this gets into some of the personnel changes 
that have occurred between, since 64

07:15.255 --> 07:27.812
and now. I cannot overemphasize the importance of 
teas in that whole process. And as a matter of fact,

07:37.059 --> 07:44.829
the importance of teas in my decision to come to 
Texas A&M. And if you want to get into that now, we

07:44.849 --> 07:47.812
can. But it was an absolutely critical thing. 
Because quite frankly, I think if If there hadn't

07:55.957 --> 07:59.801
been teas, I wouldn't have come to Texas A&M. It's 
that simple.

08:04.265 --> 08:21.101
And I well remember

08:04.265 --> 08:21.101
what a very positive reaction that I had after my 
interview here, because I thought, these people

08:04.265 --> 08:21.101
know how it's done. And the positive reaction came 
largely from two men, Al Kronk, who was then the

08:24.070 --> 08:43.330
head of the Aerospace Department, and above all, 
Harry Whitmore, who had just come in, I think, in,

08:24.070 --> 08:43.330
what, 63, I think, just a year before, to head up the 
Space Technology Division, so-called.

08:44.211 --> 08:53.301
Now, I'm going to make some comments here that 
would appear to be critical of Al Kronk, but they

08:44.211 --> 08:53.301
should not be interpreted that way. He was and 
still is, although he's in poor health

08:54.192 --> 09:03.668
now, a hell of a guy. And I really came to love that 
man. However, Al was like so many of our

09:07.414 --> 09:17.230
engineering department heads back in those days 
in that he was not research-oriented. He did not

09:18.323 --> 09:20.585
promote research. He did not push faculty to do 
research. Texas A&M's image back in the 50s, I

09:26.091 --> 09:43.990
think, although I was not here, but I think it was 
one of a super undergraduate educational

09:26.091 --> 09:43.990
institution.

09:44.291 --> 09:45.512
And in the engineering, It turned out people that 
were very well equipped to go into industry and do

09:45.813 --> 09:56.284
the job.

09:57.805 --> 10:13.221
But as I say, when Mr. Rutter came aboard in 1958, I 
guess, as Chancellor, I think, or President, I'm

09:57.805 --> 10:13.221
not really sure how that all happened, but he was 
the one who really started to promote research

10:13.893 --> 10:16.476
activities at Texas A&M. Well, we had, as I say, we 
had a number of engineering department heads,

10:17.236 --> 10:36.455
Cliff Semang in mechanical engineering, Bob 
Whiting in petroleum engineering, and on and on,

10:17.236 --> 10:36.455
Art Burgess in industrial engineering. Great 
guys, super teachers, super educators, but

10:36.475 --> 10:43.242
researchers, no. and quite honestly it was always 
my perception nobody ever told me this but it was

10:44.740 --> 11:03.070
always my perception that the space technology 
division and mr whitmore were set up to well one

10:44.740 --> 11:03.070
might say to go around al crumb in the matter of 
research. And I suppose that wouldn't be too far

11:04.643 --> 11:07.426
off base. But really, it was more to supplement 
what Professor Crump was doing in the educational

11:08.127 --> 11:22.403
arena and get a very definite research thrust 
going. And it was clear to me when I came down here in

11:22.623 --> 11:30.812
the spring of 64 that

11:31.822 --> 11:39.933
TEAS had money to spend in the promotion of 
research. And above all, they knew what that

11:39.953 --> 11:44.739
meant. And this had just a tremendous impact on me. 
Because I had determined, although I looked at

11:50.307 --> 11:59.179
industry initially when I decided to leave Ohio 
State, I had determined I was going to stay in the

11:59.429 --> 12:06.319
academic

11:59.429 --> 12:06.319
ranks. And I went over, well, among the 
institutions that I interviewed was Georgia

12:06.339 --> 12:13.229
Tech. And they had a pretty good research program. 
But I was absolutely turned off by their attitude.

12:21.201 --> 12:23.344
They wanted me to promote research. They wanted me 
to hustle money. And I said to them, well, do you

12:28.555 --> 12:33.261
have money to travel, you know, to go visit 
research funds? And they said, well, you can take

12:34.222 --> 12:37.627
that out of your research money. I said, wait a 
minute. You can't, you know, you're asking me to

12:40.290 --> 12:45.377
pull myself up by my bootstraps. You've got to 
prime the pump a bit here, you know. And it was clear

12:49.302 --> 12:53.787
they weren't all that willing to do that. But Mr. 
Whitmore and Tease were willing. And he

12:58.694 --> 12:59.675
understood. And keep in mind, of course, an awful 
lot of that credit goes to Fred Benson, because he

12:59.695 --> 13:11.810
understands, too, what is involved in building a 
program. And it's something that you just don't do

13:11.830 --> 13:16.416
overnight. So

13:16.436 --> 13:24.145
they understood that in the promotion of 
research, One does not sit down and write out a

13:25.711 --> 13:39.632
proposal, however technically excellent it 
might be, and send it to the sponsor, the potential

13:25.711 --> 13:39.632
sponsor, and say, send money by return made. It 
just does not happen that way. You must go there.

13:44.779 --> 13:49.126
You must sell yourself.

13:49.186 --> 13:50.367
You have to hustle. And that, to some, is sort of the 
senior side of academia. But you've got to do it,

13:55.529 --> 14:03.360
and there's just no substitute for having support 
of that type. And I think that having the Research

14:04.882 --> 14:16.518
Foundation, of course, was a great asset, too, 
because there you could get a

14:04.882 --> 14:16.518
professional-looking proposal turned out. 
Obviously, they, coupled with TEAS, would help

14:17.580 --> 14:22.667
you manage your research. your project, your 
money, once you got it. And that's essential

14:25.232 --> 14:45.818
because when I went, again, just to illustrate the 
counterpoint, when I went to the University of

14:25.232 --> 14:45.818
Maryland, again, I went into a department, if you 
can believe this, 20 minutes from downtown

14:25.232 --> 14:45.818
Washington, where many of the research sponsors 
were located. And again, when I went to Maryland,

14:45.838 --> 14:52.907
that department had not paid anyone in research 
when I went there. And they did not have an

14:53.512 --> 14:56.556
engineering experiment station. They did not 
have a research foundation. And I lucked out and

14:59.579 --> 15:05.766
rather quickly got a nice grant from NASA to do some 
wind tunnel studies. And I had to hire a gal into the

15:06.507 --> 15:14.757
department office there to keep books on this 
project. You know, the very sorts of things that

15:14.777 --> 15:21.865
the research foundation and MPs do for you. Well, 
that kind of support, you see, is just of

15:22.756 --> 15:30.638
inestimable value in the promotion of research. 
And so all of that infrastructure was here. And, of

15:37.640 --> 15:40.924
course, Ohio State had had a very strong research 
foundation. Their engineering experiment

15:40.944 --> 15:45.870
station was nothing like this one here. So I had 
some appreciation of what these support

15:47.292 --> 15:54.140
institutions could do for you. And that was all 
here, and that was all in place. And to have that,

15:57.424 --> 15:59.867
you see, coupled with With Mr. Whitmore's 
attitude, you know, yeah, I got some money for you.

16:06.824 --> 16:09.728
And if you need help, you come see me. And it was just 
too good to pass up. And of course, I'd have to say

16:15.035 --> 16:25.230
that there were some other factors involved in 
coming to Texas A&M. I was born and raised in small

16:26.003 --> 16:32.712
towns, and so I liked the kind of small town 
atmosphere. And I liked the attitude of the

16:33.273 --> 16:39.702
people, and I thought it was a good place to raise my 
kids. And so that, too, was a major concern. But in

16:43.167 --> 16:51.538
terms of Dick Thomas's professional 
development, I don't think I could have found And

16:52.160 --> 16:57.965
frankly, I tell young people today, I don't think 
they could find today any better atmosphere.

16:58.526 --> 17:03.310
Although the teaching loans, of course, have 
increased substantially in recent years. And

17:03.330 --> 17:06.854
that's, I know, a very negative factor in 
recruiting people. But in terms of promoting

17:06.874 --> 17:18.024
research, it's difficult to find a better 
environment, a better atmosphere in which to do

17:06.874 --> 17:18.024
that. So please... He's contributed heavily, I 
think, to the elevation of Texas A&M's image as a

17:20.982 --> 17:29.578
research institution. We've still got a ways to 
go. But when you look, when you consider that,

17:32.143 --> 17:43.986
what, 25, 26 years since Mr. Rutter took over and 
set us on this path, If you look back at what we've

17:44.590 --> 17:52.177
accomplished in those 25 years, it's really quite 
incredible. It really is. A lot of people don't

17:52.518 --> 17:57.483
appreciate that, but he's contributed heavily to 
that. When you first came, was the wind tunnel

17:57.503 --> 18:01.607
still housing hay? Was it still what? Was it still a 
hay barn? Well, not quite. Almost. That brings

18:12.569 --> 18:22.379
back a lot of memories.

18:25.662 --> 18:40.517
The wind tunnel was there, and had recently, that 
is, I say recently, but I think, I'm not sure when it

18:25.662 --> 18:40.517
was, I think in the late 50s and early 60s, had been 
upgraded, because initially it was an open

18:25.662 --> 18:40.517
circuit, or an open throat type wind tunnel, And 
you just have difficulty doing precise research

18:41.375 --> 18:50.566
in a facility like that. And so they had closed it. 
They had put in the return leg. And Joe Bruce and his

18:55.672 --> 19:09.289
crew had just done a magnificent job of going in and 
ferreting out sources of turbulence and

18:55.672 --> 19:09.289
instability in the tunnel. And they had put in the 
balance to measure forces on models.

19:19.540 --> 19:36.137
But it had kind of fallen on hard times, because I 
think although they had put in the balance, they

19:19.540 --> 19:36.137
did not put in a data system, a system that would 
more or less automatically

19:37.670 --> 19:42.255
process the data coming out of the balance and out 
of the one tunnel. And I don't know whether that

19:42.275 --> 19:45.779
was, well, there was another problem, too. I 
should back up here a bit and say, as you've

19:47.060 --> 20:06.681
probably already been told by others, that it was 
hoped that by upgrading the tunnel, that it could

19:47.060 --> 20:06.681
do, it could support itself with a lot of 
commercial testing for people like LTD and

20:07.488 --> 20:11.472
General Dynamics and others. And it also, of 
course, it would provide a basis for some good

20:11.793 --> 20:20.021
aerodynamic research. Well, at about that time, 
for whatever reason,

20:20.041 --> 20:32.955
General Dynamics started building its own wind 
tunneling facilities, and other organizations

20:20.041 --> 20:32.955
did too. And I think that, coupled with the fact 
that we weren't really equipped to do commercial

20:33.728 --> 21:02.773
processing of wind tunnel data, commercial 
testing, just led to the circumstance that

20:33.728 --> 21:02.773
occurred when I came in, and that was that the wind 
tunnel had been shut down, basically, and we're

20:33.728 --> 21:02.773
just sitting there gathering dust. And so to that 
extent, it was a big one. And I remember one of the

21:10.809 --> 21:23.007
first groups of students that I had, one of the 
first courses I taught that dealt with low-speed

21:10.809 --> 21:23.007
aerodynamics. And so I went to Mr. Kronk and Mr. 
Whitmore, and I said, you know, Can we use the wind

21:30.648 --> 21:35.695
tunnel for some student demonstrations? And so I 
took a bunch of students out there, and down in the

21:35.835 --> 21:48.292
basement of the tunnel, we found a big box that 
looked rather like a coffin. But in that box, we

21:48.312 --> 21:51.797
found a model, a wind tunnel model. And it had been, 
it was a Temco, that's the T in LTV, used to be

21:58.306 --> 22:05.335
Lintemco Walk. And Temco, back, I don't know, back 
in the 50s, was preparing a bid on the development

22:05.356 --> 22:20.536
and production of a cargo airplane for the Air 
Force or something. And they had this model. And

22:23.460 --> 22:26.524
apparently they were unsuccessful in their bid. 
And then, of course, were then absorbed by Ling and

22:27.280 --> 22:35.669
his operation. And apparently never took the 
model back. And so

22:39.233 --> 22:50.706
with the traditional Aggie enthusiasm, my 
students tore into that thing. They assembled the

22:50.726 --> 22:51.887
model. We installed it in the wind tunnel with Mr. 
Bruce's invaluable assistance, and we ran a

22:52.660 --> 23:01.693
series of tests on that model. And again, this was 
just principally for the educational

23:01.713 --> 23:08.543
enlightenment of the students. But we sort of blew 
the dust out of the tunnel at that time, and I guess

23:09.865 --> 23:19.900
it was through that experience that I...

23:21.736 --> 23:35.597
I became convinced that it was a fine facility, 
excellent flow characteristics in it, again, due

23:21.736 --> 23:35.597
to Mr. Bruce's

23:21.736 --> 23:35.597
terrible work. And I thought it was possible to do 
some research with it. And although it was out of my

23:42.467 --> 23:51.000
area, I was trained principally in hypersonic 
aerodynamics and reentry processes. I was not,

23:51.638 --> 23:58.807
and am not, a low-speed

23:51.638 --> 23:58.807
guy. But I learned to fly during World War II, and I 
still enjoy flying. And so, you know,

24:02.051 --> 24:14.086
to that extent, I'm interested in low-speed. 
Because the airplanes I fly, they'll go very fast.

24:15.127 --> 24:17.490
And I had done some crop testing and things like 
that. We were fortunate then in the in the mid-60s

24:19.988 --> 24:29.596
to get some work from NASA for work in the wind 
tunnel. But here again, you see, I well remember a

24:29.616 --> 24:38.704
trip that I took to NASA Langley after having done 
what groundwork I could do by phone. And I went up

24:40.306 --> 24:48.493
there and talked to a guy who eventually became a 
very good friend, Jerry Rainey.

24:49.840 --> 24:54.746
and essentially convinced him that he ought to 
give some money to Texas A&M. And you see, if I'd

24:56.308 --> 25:07.741
been at Georgia Tech, for example, or some other 
institution that didn't have that support for

24:56.308 --> 25:07.741
you, it would have just been impossible.

25:08.682 --> 25:11.646
And there was another element to that incident 
thinking back on it. The aero department has a

25:14.565 --> 25:18.631
small wind tunnel, a two foot by three foot, I think 
it is. Yeah, it seemed that. That's not anywhere

25:20.613 --> 25:24.899
near the same wind tunnel. Right. However, we were 
doing some work on gust generators. We were

25:27.983 --> 25:34.052
proposing for Langley to do some work on gust 
generations. And we built a little prototype of

25:34.372 --> 25:39.439
our gust generator and put it in that tunnel, in 
that small tunnel, to prove the concept. And that

25:44.578 --> 25:52.226
construction of that little prototype was done 
with T's money. And I'm sure that when I went to see

25:52.246 --> 26:07.121
Mr. Rainey at Langley, and I showed him, I said, you 
know, here we did a little very crude

25:52.246 --> 26:07.121
improvisation of what we wanted to do in the big 
tunnel.

26:07.982 --> 26:09.223
And he was impressed with it. And so here, this is 
just the way, just the way tea's, tea's work, you

26:10.722 --> 26:16.968
see, the tea's money works. Just, just absolutely 
invaluable. When you came back in,

26:23.254 --> 26:31.962
uh, 71, did you become involved in the shuttle 
research? In what? Shuttle research? No, no. What

26:33.884 --> 26:34.905
were you doing? Uh, uh, when I, uh, You see, in 1970, 
or well, 69,

26:38.954 --> 26:54.658
when Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon, the space 
program started downhill. And also, for the first

26:56.320 --> 27:05.734
time in history, all three of the support areas 
generally active in aerospace engineering went

26:56.320 --> 27:05.734
downhill. That is, aerospace engineering in the 
60s and so forth, 70s, rested on a three-legged

27:08.637 --> 27:16.608
stool. One is commercial and general aviation. 
Another one is military aviation, and the third is

27:20.294 --> 27:23.979
space. And generally, in times past, those things 
would not be synchronized. That is, if one went

27:31.329 --> 27:36.096
down, one of the other would be going up, and things 
were relatively balanced. Well, in the late 60s

27:37.207 --> 27:47.280
and early 70s, for the first time in history, they 
all three went down together. And it was not a good

27:47.301 --> 27:54.170
time for an aerospace engineer to be out looking 
for a job.

27:55.071 --> 27:59.637
Research money had dried up.

28:04.055 --> 28:12.968
The student enrollments went down in the early 70s 
because engineers couldn't get jobs.

28:12.988 --> 28:14.309
It was a tough situation. The department over here 
had more faculty than it needed. And Dr. Norton and

28:19.977 --> 28:33.977
others will tell you, Jim Strickland, when he was 
alive and was here, they were urged to go out and

28:19.977 --> 28:33.977
hustle research money in order to keep themselves 
afloat financially, because I think by 1973 or 4, I

28:34.210 --> 28:49.784
think the total number of graduates out of the 
department

28:34.210 --> 28:49.784
was something like 20. And so when I came back, then 
Mr. Benson put me in a position as a special

29:02.003 --> 29:17.967
assistant to him with the task of simply promoting 
some new research for the 14s and for the College of

29:02.003 --> 29:17.967
Engineering. And I did not, as a matter of fact, my 
title at that time, my academic title was

29:19.389 --> 29:29.024
professor of engineering, not professor of 
aerospace engineering. And so it was only later on

29:30.640 --> 29:41.293
when the enrollments came back that I got involved 
again with the aero

29:30.640 --> 29:41.293
department. And so, no, I had not anything to do 
with the shuttle test. I think the only thing I

29:48.221 --> 29:58.453
could claim credit for was that prior to those 
tests we did get the wind tunnel back in operation

29:48.221 --> 29:58.453
and And we had a going facility. And then, of 
course, NASA came in and bought us a data system,

30:01.916 --> 30:11.692
bought us a computer to do the processing. And 
that's the kind of a facility we should have had

30:11.712 --> 30:15.639
back in the early 60s. Did they have those types of 
things developed in the early 60s? Yeah. Yeah,

30:20.894 --> 30:24.520
they were mostly analog computers. We had one in 
Ohio State

30:24.560 --> 30:32.273
in the 1950s, and other facilities had them too. 
They're nothing

30:32.293 --> 30:37.862
like, of course, you have today. But yeah, they had 
facilities that made

30:37.882 --> 30:47.678
it possible to look at the data very quickly. And 
that was the big problem. You see, when a guy runs a

30:50.229 --> 30:55.566
wind tunnel test, he wants the results right now. 
Because, of course, oftentimes he'll look at the

30:56.910 --> 31:01.144
data And depending on the way that looks and his 
interpretation of that, that will determine what

31:01.850 --> 31:10.118
the next test is going to be. Well, you see the setup 
they had in the late 50s and early 60s was such that

31:10.178 --> 31:18.886
they could take data in a very raw form. And they had 
to bring it into the DPC, punch it into CARBs, and

31:19.787 --> 31:25.372
then process it. And so, shoot, you were lucky if 
you got it the next day. And, of course, those guys

31:30.757 --> 31:35.723
wanted to, you know, the sponsors wanted it right 
now. And that was the problem. When you came back as

31:38.867 --> 31:48.578
the assistant, were other departments besides 
aerospace having... Were they what? Were other

31:49.059 --> 31:52.022
departments having trouble getting research 
money, too? Was there a slope in the others? Oh, no,

31:54.565 --> 31:58.570
dear, I don't think I'd say that.

32:00.862 --> 32:13.399
Incidentally, we're skipping over some other 
things here that occurred in the late 60s that

32:00.862 --> 32:13.399
would involve teas, and I guess we ought to come 
back and talk about those. But because, you see, we

32:13.419 --> 32:28.039
haven't talked about the flight lab, we haven't 
talked about the shock tube, both of which were...

32:13.419 --> 32:28.039
resulted totally from what teas did. But... But to 
answer your question, no. In the 60s and 70s, there

32:32.672 --> 32:48.807
was a general push toward the hiring of faculty 
that had research capabilities. And so just as I

32:48.827 --> 32:59.877
had been hired into Arrow to promote a research

32:48.827 --> 32:59.877
program, they had attempted and had been 
successful in hiring other people in other

33:00.683 --> 33:04.847
departments. And so

33:04.867 --> 33:16.258
I think Texas A&M was moving ahead on a fairly broad 
front

33:04.867 --> 33:16.258
in research. Now, these were mainly in what you 
might call the traditional areas of research. And

33:23.766 --> 33:30.252
so when I came back,

33:31.733 --> 33:47.873
I had a conversation, before I came back, I had a 
conversation with Mr. Benson, a conversation I

33:31.733 --> 33:47.873
will never forget, wherein he outlined for me what 
he thought he wanted me to do. And incidentally, I

33:47.893 --> 33:52.038
was not an assistant dean at that point. I was a 
special assistant to the dean. And so it was purely

33:56.945 --> 34:01.291
a research endeavor. It had no academic 
functions, and I didn't work with students at all.

34:08.041 --> 34:21.479
But Mr. Benson,

34:08.041 --> 34:21.479
and of course it will be clear to you that I revere 
that man greatly. A lot of people think that he's

34:21.499 --> 34:24.083
kind of a a staid

34:24.451 --> 34:39.358
thinker, you know, who doesn't have much 
outreach, or looking for new ideas, and nothing

34:24.451 --> 34:39.358
could be further from the truth. Because, and here 
again, this was This was kind of a typical TEAS

34:44.178 --> 34:46.903
operation. He just simply wanted me to find some 
new areas in which TEAS and the College of

34:46.923 --> 35:01.167
Engineering could work, non-traditional

34:46.923 --> 35:01.167
areas. And as far as he was concerned,

35:01.187 --> 35:08.700
I had carte blanche to move in any direction I 
wanted to move. It was as if he had given me a little

35:10.402 --> 35:20.917
chunk of money, which he did, and said, in effect, 
here, go do something great with this. And it was

35:20.937 --> 35:27.366
absolutely one of the most exhilarating 
experiences I ever had in my life. And he just ran

35:27.707 --> 35:33.775
some things by me, you know, the way he was 
thinking. He said that...

35:37.469 --> 35:49.183
He thought that, of course, keep in mind, we were in 
the midst of the Vietnam debacle

35:37.469 --> 35:49.183
at that time. And he said, you know, for the first 
time in history, our technology has failed us in

35:49.203 --> 35:57.693
Vietnam. Of course, we know now why

35:57.713 --> 36:02.438
that happened. It was a political thing. But he 
suggested that we might do a piece of research

36:05.448 --> 36:19.140
looking at why technology failed, or if 
technology had failed in Vietnam, and if it had,

36:05.448 --> 36:19.140
why it had. That blew my mind. It, of course, would 
have been a tremendously interesting piece of

36:22.062 --> 36:34.273
research, and I nosed into it a little bit to find 
out that at that point there was so much

36:22.062 --> 36:34.273
stonewalling going on And, of course, you'd have

36:35.131 --> 36:42.239
to get access to classified information. And so we 
didn't pursue that very much. He was very

36:46.343 --> 36:53.090
concerned about advanced transportation

36:46.343 --> 36:53.090
systems. And that kind of surprised me because, of 
course, he had been the founder of TTI. But he was

36:58.176 --> 37:03.461
concerned that TTI was not reaching out far 
enough. And they were too content to sit here doing

37:05.675 --> 37:06.996
highway research. I mean, good stuff, don't 
misunderstand, good stuff, but research that

37:07.016 --> 37:14.804
was, again, pretty traditional stuff. And at that 
time, you know, there was great interest in some of

37:14.824 --> 37:33.522
these people-mover systems and the

37:14.824 --> 37:33.522
old things like the Air Trans up at Dallas, the DFW 
airport, you know, unmanned, automated kinds of

37:14.824 --> 37:33.522
systems. And he thought we ought to be getting into 
that. And so we did mount some efforts in

37:41.460 --> 37:47.527
that direction. The whole issue of productivity 
was beginning to emerge then. And that later

37:53.273 --> 37:59.880
developed

37:53.273 --> 37:59.880
into a fairly substantial program for us, to find 
ways to use new technology to increase the

38:00.299 --> 38:12.715
efficiency

38:00.299 --> 38:12.715
of manufacturing and production within the 
United States. So still, of course, a very, very

38:12.735 --> 38:13.736
hot issue. And I think it's a tribute to Mr. Benson 
that he saw that coming down the road.

38:21.526 --> 38:27.353
So as I say, he just

38:28.531 --> 38:41.026
wanted me to sort of follow my nose and try to 
develop some new research areas for the 14s and

38:28.531 --> 38:41.026
45s. So that was my assignment when I came back. You 
said productivity developed into big studies,

38:44.910 --> 38:53.120
but here, what group was it that was doing this? 
Well, there wasn't any group doing it at the time.

38:58.687 --> 39:13.763
So the people that we drew on to develop that 
program were folks out of industrial engineering

38:58.687 --> 39:13.763
and I guess principally out of IT. There were some 
other folks in ME and W that were interested, but

39:13.783 --> 39:25.996
the involvement principally came out of 
industrial engineering. But the thrust of that as

39:28.673 --> 39:37.062
it turned out, was, well, I guess there were two 
things. One major thrust dealt with technology

39:38.023 --> 39:42.828
transfer. Now, that has a different connotation 
today than it did then, those words. Nowadays,

39:48.994 --> 39:57.803
when you say technology transfer, people are 
talking about the movement of technology from the

39:48.994 --> 39:57.803
U.S. to the Soviet Union. which is an interesting 
and vital question. But back in those days, it had

40:03.562 --> 40:10.989
to do with what might better be called the 
diffusion of technology. That is to say, one of the

40:11.029 --> 40:18.896
things we studied dealt with numerically 
controlled machines. These are machine tools,

40:18.937 --> 40:27.925
lathes, milling machines, and so forth, that 
early on were controlled what you might call a very

40:28.900 --> 40:32.526
crude computer. But it was a numerical system, an 
automated system, really based on punched paper

40:32.546 --> 40:44.226
tapes, paper tape with holes in it that contained 
signals that would guide the machine. And so

40:44.246 --> 40:53.541
instead of having a machinist sit there with his 
eye twisting the knobs very carefully and so

40:44.246 --> 40:53.541
forth, it was all automated. If you went up to 
General Dynamics, for example, and bought, and

40:53.892 --> 41:04.807
other aerospace manufacturers, for example, 
you'd find lots of NC machines. You'd go to Hughes

41:05.829 --> 41:19.548
Tool, or Cameron Ironworks, or some of the smaller 
machine shops that populate Houston and Dallas,

41:05.829 --> 41:19.548
you'd find nothing, or very little. Which 
indicated that, for some reason or other, That

41:22.715 --> 41:29.926
technology had not diffused, had not moved 
through American industry. And the belief was,

41:30.788 --> 41:39.441
quite properly, that if we could do that, if we 
could somehow stimulate that, that we could help

41:30.788 --> 41:39.441
industry increase its productivity. become more 
efficient, become more competitive with Japan

41:40.298 --> 41:44.584
and Germany. So that was the general move. It 
headed much toward the manufacturing. Was there a

41:54.519 --> 41:59.947
particular center or division established to 
handle this? No, no. It never evolved into that. We

42:04.413 --> 42:09.681
just simply called it the Productivity Program.

42:12.142 --> 42:21.752
And we had a problem emerge there, quite honestly, 
that we still have today. And this is, I guess here

42:21.772 --> 42:29.660
I'm going, I'm about to utter my first critical 
remark of Teade's.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.508
The kinds of work that I was attempting to promote 
there, as I've already indicated, was

42:38.720 --> 42:44.288
interdisciplinary. That is to say, we needed to 
get industrial, mechanical, and electrical

42:44.308 --> 42:52.359
engineers involved. The reward system as it is set 
up now, and TEAS has been part of this, is one

42:52.379 --> 43:08.541
wherein a department head and a faculty member is 
credited, literally credited, with the money he

43:09.466 --> 43:11.669
brings to his department.

43:14.312 --> 43:28.410
And if a guy, let's suppose that a program is 
focused in some external center, in this center,

43:14.312 --> 43:28.410
for example, we still have this problem. If I get a 
half million dollars to do a piece of research, And

43:35.048 --> 43:43.121
I go to mechanical engineering and industrial 
engineering and any engineering department. And

43:43.141 --> 43:49.611
I pull simply because the work is attractive. I 
get, say, three professors, one from each one of

43:49.631 --> 43:54.418
those departments, to work with me on the project. 
They didn't get any credit for that.

44:04.225 --> 44:18.789
A portion, you know, although they would deserve, 
the department would deserve credit for a portion

44:04.225 --> 44:18.789
of that money that I've gotten because I got the 
money based on the capabilities that exist over

44:04.225 --> 44:18.789
there, you see. But the way the reward structure is 
set up, it doesn't address that. And so that's a

44:25.538 --> 44:31.646
real severe problem that, as I say, exists today. 
And tease, and I've bitched at Dr. Porter and

44:32.287 --> 44:49.390
others about this, and

44:32.287 --> 44:49.390
they nod every time I complain, and say, oh, yes, 
well, here's Thomas and his usual gripe. But it is a

44:49.690 --> 44:53.055
real severe problem. So the productivity program 
never really blossomed. And the reason that it

45:00.278 --> 45:08.488
didn't blossom was that when I got some money, we 
got some money from the National Science

45:00.278 --> 45:08.488
Foundation. Industrial Engineering took their 
little chunk of money and went back to Industrial

45:08.508 --> 45:16.877
Engineering and did their little thing and they 
said to hell with these other guys. And I was just

45:17.858 --> 45:22.984
absolutely unable to to bring any kind of an 
interdisciplinary effort

45:24.550 --> 45:32.265
there. And so there's

45:32.525 --> 45:42.103
a real problem there that somehow, someway, we 
have to surmount. And it's not an easy thing. And

45:46.864 --> 45:50.814
Texas A&M and Tees is not the only one that has that 
problem. It's a universal problem. But the

45:55.306 --> 45:57.291
productivity...
