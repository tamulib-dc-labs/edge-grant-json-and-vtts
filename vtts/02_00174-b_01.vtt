WEBVTT

00:04.553 --> 00:11.321
I did not do well in Frigg, that

00:04.553 --> 00:11.321
pole. How big were the classes?

00:17.149 --> 00:25.399
Well, in that class, it

00:17.149 --> 00:25.399
would have been 25 or 30, probably. But none of 
these huge ones? Not in Frigg. Now, in chemistry,

00:31.975 --> 00:37.001
Well, in organic chemistry, that was a large, very 
large lecture. The lecture part was large, and

00:37.202 --> 00:43.990
then we broke up, you know, and recitation was a 
somewhat smaller class. Did you have any of the

00:44.010 --> 00:49.117
legendary faculty member teachers that freshman 
year?

00:58.849 --> 01:01.392
I can't remember the name of the guy in Trigg, but 
I've always felt that

01:01.658 --> 01:23.387
his approach was not helpful for me because he 
really expected you to get it yourself, as a

01:01.658 --> 01:23.387
student, I mean. He just left you. Floundering 
right now routine of the day described a class day a

01:26.245 --> 01:39.419
typical routine y'all got up at 6 6 30 Fill out went 
to went to chow. Yeah in the morning and back to

01:39.520 --> 01:49.030
through the room pick up books and go go to class and 
And did you fall out for lunch? Yes, we fell out for

01:54.644 --> 01:57.168
each meal. We had meal formation. Thursday 
afternoons were all TC or drill anyway. And where

02:03.517 --> 02:05.540
did y'all drill?

02:08.424 --> 02:20.080
My freshman year, we drilled on the,

02:08.424 --> 02:20.080
in the area, by Welburn Road, and

02:21.511 --> 02:37.606
also in that open area between Walton, just due 
west of Sabeasa. That was our basic area to drill.

02:41.329 --> 02:48.936
Then

02:41.329 --> 02:48.936
come back and get ready for our evening chow. then 
did you come back to your dorm room every night for

02:49.574 --> 03:18.147
study yeah uh where did could you or any other fish 
escape from that routine during the day where

02:49.574 --> 03:18.147
could you kind of hide out relax well we had the uh 
see the memorial student center was new and uh That

03:18.633 --> 03:20.475
was a popular place. Also, you could go to Guyon 
Hall and go to the movies in the afternoon. In the

03:25.359 --> 03:26.480
afternoon? Mm-hmm. Oh, I didn't know they had 
afternoon movies. Well, maybe this was on the

03:30.924 --> 03:32.705
weekend. Okay. Because I didn't go except on the 
weekend, I can think. And did you all go to the

03:40.993 --> 03:42.394
library? I think maybe it was just a Saturday. Did 
you go to the library as a hideout? during the day?

03:48.761 --> 03:52.586
Sometimes, uh-huh. But we had a pretty small 
library at that time. If you were sleepy and wanted

03:55.751 --> 04:10.611
to take a nap, where could you do that?

04:16.075 --> 04:23.303
The library was probably the safest place, but 
that was not something. I

04:23.323 --> 04:35.996
know that that's something that some of the 
students would do, but that wasn't my forte, I

04:23.323 --> 04:35.996
guess. Typical behavior in class. Did you all go to 
class regularly? Were you wide awake? Yeah,

04:43.733 --> 04:45.516
except after lunch. Well, in the summertime, 
especially. No, but in the long semesters. In the

04:49.722 --> 04:52.446
long semester, yeah. Well,

04:54.468 --> 05:01.278
I have much less recall of classes. I remember 
animal husbandry, 107. I remember that class

05:05.324 --> 05:09.470
because it was from my background. I had just been 
looking forward. having a real easy class. Surely

05:20.333 --> 05:25.949
there would be one that would be really 
interesting and really easy, and so I'd look

05:20.333 --> 05:25.949
forward to that. Boy, it was pretty tough. Maurice 
Shelton was teaching it. Maurice retired from the

05:34.422 --> 05:43.455
Texas Agricultural Experiment Station out at San 
Angelo, goat specialist. But Maurice was

05:45.138 --> 05:51.367
finishing his PhD, so he was really a keen sort of an 
individual. And he just, man, he really worked us.

05:55.894 --> 05:59.539
Did that add to your veterinary medicine desire? 
that course

06:00.211 --> 06:22.793
well it helped focus it a little bit i had as i 
remember that was something that i i did find that

06:00.211 --> 06:22.793
aspect refreshing that at least i was getting to be 
around animals a little bit and uh so that that was

06:00.211 --> 06:22.793
helping because all of this other would have been 
pretty foreign to veterinary medicine as far as I

06:24.528 --> 06:27.251
could see. I couldn't understand why in the world a 
veterinarian had needed to do all of this stuff.

06:32.237 --> 06:34.840
You know, typical college freshman. And you never 
thought about changing your major? Not that year.

06:41.327 --> 06:54.062
But see, we're getting to a point now at the end of 
this semester because of my problem with organic

06:41.327 --> 06:54.062
chemistry and that intrigue.

06:54.464 --> 07:11.494
I became had become pretty frustrated with 
academia and when I went home at Christmas time of

06:54.464 --> 07:11.494
course this was not the end of the semester this was 
a Christmas break talked to some guys about my age

07:11.997 --> 07:19.166
out there that were really hauling it in, working 
in the oil field. And so I just decided that, well,

07:20.868 --> 07:30.799
at the very least I needed to work, try that for a 
while. And I could always go back to school in the

07:32.361 --> 07:39.810
fall and I'd still be on schedule. and so i i laid out 
after oh you dropped out i dropped out of school my

07:41.714 --> 08:08.127
dad really tongue-lashed me and my mother cried 
you know did did you talk to anybody here and no

07:41.714 --> 08:08.127
advisor or anything here about whether or not that 
was a good idea you decided it and did you stay at

07:41.714 --> 08:08.127
home yeah i lived at home and worked uh went to work 
for uh a roustabout company that was owned by Dr.

08:09.271 --> 08:15.540
John Milliff's brother. I didn't know that at the 
time, of course, that they were. What kind of big

08:20.767 --> 08:22.289
money did you make? Well, I made, starting as a 
roustabout, I think I made $1.10 an hour, which was

08:23.150 --> 08:34.566
really pretty good. And I was able to put in a lot of 
hours. And before then in the summer, after, well,

08:38.887 --> 09:01.823
maybe this isn't about school, but see, I had made 
this decision that I was going to lay out and take a

08:38.887 --> 09:01.823
look at the oil business as a life, you know, 
occupation. and so I did and I got this job with this

09:03.946 --> 09:30.122
this roustabout company and my first morning the 
first task that that my crew had was to string

09:03.946 --> 09:30.122
a water line for a well that was to be drilled out in a 
new oil field that was being developed between

09:31.216 --> 09:38.967
Winters and Coleman. And they got me up, woke me up 
about four o'clock that morning, and it was

09:40.489 --> 09:50.683
snowing. And we went out, there were four of us in 
the cab of this truck, just sitting on top of one

09:52.366 --> 10:01.138
another, everybody except the driver. And we had a 
load of, it was a semi-truck loaded with pipe that

10:01.979 --> 10:18.582
was to be two-inch pipe that was to be, I didn't know 
it at the time, but we were going to scatter it over

10:01.979 --> 10:18.582
this rocky terrain. And the first step was for 
someone to walk along behind and grab one of them

10:19.884 --> 10:29.978
and pull it off as the truck kind of winded its way 
across this ranch land. And then we would come back

10:37.350 --> 10:41.576
and join them together, you know, and do it that 
way. Well, guess who got to unload the pipe? The new

10:45.041 --> 10:46.623
guy on the crew. And so that was a real jolt to me, you 
know, reality, a lesson in reality. I mean, this

10:53.573 --> 10:57.518
was not what I thought working in the oil field 
would be like. nearly froze to death that morning.

11:01.417 --> 11:05.701
And so you did that for spring and summer. In the 
summer I started roughnecking. Got a job working

11:09.625 --> 11:17.753
on a drilling rig and making a dollar fifty an hour, 
you know. And I thought long and hard about staying

11:17.773 --> 11:23.058
with that company. It was a drilling company out of 
Fort Worth and they wanted me to stay. and of course

11:29.797 --> 11:52.699
naturally they would as I look back on it because it 
was real hard to find workers all right and but then

11:29.797 --> 11:52.699
anyway I think one of the biggest things 
influences was my mother's crying and she was not a

11:29.797 --> 11:52.699
person that did that often but I knew that it I had 
really disappointed her by laying out, so I did

11:53.405 --> 12:02.978
come back to A&M to start my sophomore year. Right, 
and you're back in the Corps, and you are a few hours

12:03.499 --> 12:10.990
behind being a sophomore? No, I had 30,

12:13.433 --> 12:19.902
maybe 32 hours. I did, I should have had 36, I think.

12:26.792 --> 12:30.697
But I... You're back in the Corps. Uh-huh. In the 
same outfit? No, but I cannot remember. It was a

12:37.845 --> 12:43.412
squadron over in the, in the regular Corps area. 
What kind of a sophomore were you in your relations

12:43.952 --> 12:47.897
with the fish?

12:50.493 --> 13:11.151
Well, I thought I was pretty benign, but I've had, 
there were two or three that I had went to class

12:50.493 --> 13:11.151
with, two or three freshmen who went to class

12:50.493 --> 13:11.151
with me in botany class that thought that I was 
Pretty tough sophomore. And how were you fairly

13:15.721 --> 13:26.797
sure that you were taking the right classes that 
sophomore year to be sure you were going to be ready

13:15.721 --> 13:26.797
for vet school? Who advised you?

13:40.337 --> 13:41.779
I did not have a... contact with the vet school 
until the spring semester. So you're still on your

13:48.288 --> 13:49.369
own. So I guess I'm still in general studies.

13:57.938 --> 14:05.346
And I just do not have the name, you know, there's 
not a name there that was influential. Was it

14:05.586 --> 14:10.772
better to be a sophomore in the Corps than it had 
been to be a freshman? Yeah, much better in that Of

14:13.147 --> 14:28.108
course, at that point, when I came back, I had

14:13.147 --> 14:28.108
my own agenda pretty well set in my mind as to what I 
was going to do and how it was going to be. And I had

14:28.889 --> 14:34.817
resolved that it was veterinary medicine over the 
Corps. And so I would participate in the Corps and

14:35.438 --> 14:42.748
meet my obligations, but I wasn't going to get 
caught up in it. I think I had to a certain extent as a

14:45.546 --> 14:50.314
freshman. It had become something of a diversion. 
What did you do with all of that money that you had

14:54.321 --> 15:00.492
made as a Love Hill employee? Well, it didn't last 
very long. You didn't have a car? Yeah, yeah. Oh. I

15:08.176 --> 15:13.141
came back with a 1941 Club Coupe Pontiac. Sure did. 
And the average student didn't have a car then.

15:18.267 --> 15:18.827
That's right. Yeah. And I remember two things with 
that Club Coupe Pontiac. One was, it was the only

15:24.734 --> 15:33.022
car I ever had where the universal joint broke on 
the drive shaft, you know. Talk about a helpless

15:33.623 --> 15:36.526
feeling. But that happened. out in the open 
highway between here and Winters. And the other

15:41.598 --> 15:52.793
was brake

15:41.598 --> 15:52.793
line leakage, you know, the old rubber diaphragms 
at each wheel, one of those that come off. And we had

15:54.295 --> 16:01.224
gone uptown to, up into downtown Bryan to the, I 
guess, the Palace of the Queen and gone to a movie.

16:01.244 --> 16:04.508
There were myself and... two or three buddies. And 
we started back and coming out South College, and I

16:09.137 --> 16:20.811
had not even checked the brake pedal, I guess, 
until the traffic light there at Hillcrest.

16:22.713 --> 16:28.400
This is a,

16:22.713 --> 16:28.400
not Colter. Oh, there's a mobile station there. 
Now, there's a Hillcrest grocery store that's

16:34.255 --> 16:40.943
been there for a long time. But anyway, there was a 
traffic light there then, and there still is. And I

16:45.828 --> 16:48.952
put on the brake, and there was nothing. I never 
will forget that sensation either. Did you hit

16:52.075 --> 16:52.956
anything? No. But I remember

17:02.251 --> 17:14.885
I just remember turning left onto that street, 
whatever the name of it is, that goes on down to what

17:02.251 --> 17:14.885
eventually then where Townshire eventually was 
built. During those years, as far as you and your

17:15.266 --> 17:22.474
buddies were aware, were there any Crip courses, 
any easy giveaway courses?

17:26.339 --> 17:31.144
Well,

17:26.339 --> 17:31.144
you know, The major, a major that was generally 
regarded as kind of sniffed at by a lot of the other

17:33.132 --> 17:46.553
majors was business administration. If you were a 
BA major, that usually did not. That was supposed

17:50.659 --> 17:52.402
to be easy. Yeah, that was supposedly an easy 
major. I don't know whether that was true or not. As

17:59.211 --> 18:03.257
far as you and your buddies were aware, were there 
any giveaway courses for athletes? Well, I don't

18:04.760 --> 18:06.042
know. You know, this is one of the things that

18:06.503 --> 18:19.103
I've been thinking about as I was reflecting back. 
One of the things I'd forgotten from a long time ago

18:19.704 --> 18:24.351
was that You know, we used to have valedictorian, a 
stated valedictorian here, at least through the

18:24.803 --> 18:33.051
time it was an A&M college. Now, I don't know when 
that practice might have stopped. But the

18:36.935 --> 18:43.401
valedictorian of the class of 52 was a football 
player. And he

18:44.562 --> 18:49.247
was a . I mean, he was a sharp guy. And something 
else. that I think is

18:55.060 --> 19:19.892
different about that, well, that we saw at that 
time was that about a fourth or so of the members,

18:55.060 --> 19:19.892
the inductees into Who's Who in America, American 
colleges, would be athletes. Now this is not, I

19:20.773 --> 19:24.578
don't think this reflects catering to them so much 
as it did that there were some pretty top flight

19:24.929 --> 19:40.989
individuals as individuals that were, they were 
athletes and they were also scholars and they were

19:24.929 --> 19:40.989
also leaders. Who were the, were there some famous 
students when you were an undergraduate? that

19:48.942 --> 19:52.407
everybody knew who they were when they walked down 
the sidewalk? Well, yeah. In my freshman year, of

19:53.389 --> 20:04.005
course, Bob Smith was an All-American

19:53.389 --> 20:04.005
running back or fullback. I can't remember which. 
But everybody recognized him. Darryl Hooper,

20:08.753 --> 20:17.346
Olympian, and also a football player. Now, were 
they in uniform during the day? I've seen, yeah,

20:20.731 --> 20:28.585
I've seen both of them in uniform now, but I've also 
seen them not in uniform during the day. Were they?

20:30.789 --> 20:38.322
They generally, when you saw them out of uniform in 
non-reg, when you saw them non-reg, it was usually

20:39.871 --> 20:45.957
between Hart Hall and the athletic complex. And as 
far as y'all remember, those highly, those famous

20:46.238 --> 20:58.090
athletes were pleasant students. They said hello 
and they chatted with other people. Yeah, there

21:02.495 --> 21:08.241
were, I

21:02.495 --> 21:08.241
found that, impressive. I see there was a, what was 
the guy's name, he was a basketball player that

21:10.162 --> 21:18.132
made an honorable mention in All America, I think. 
And he was just a very approachable, just a very

21:20.695 --> 21:27.104
outgoing sort of a guy. Now Bob Smith was pretty 
aloof. I remember, one of the things I remember is

21:29.647 --> 21:37.738
going to a movie at the campus theater, One night, I 
can't remember what the movie was. It was full.

21:42.082 --> 21:45.646
There was some, I guess it was a special movie or 
something. And Bob Smith came in after the house

21:46.547 --> 21:52.335
was pretty well packed. The lights were still on, 
though. And his date was one Miss Harrison, Dick

21:54.598 --> 22:02.868
Harrison's sister. And I think maybe they married 
eventually. But she was an eye-catcher, too, and a

22:07.773 --> 22:16.785
lot of catcall-type things, you know. And during 
that sophomore year, you and your buddies were

22:19.489 --> 22:29.262
involved in all kinds of the traditions. What was 
silver taps like for you when you first attended?

22:36.231 --> 22:37.493
Very, very... somber occasions, really, really 
emotional to me. Touched your feelings? Yeah.

22:48.710 --> 22:50.972
What about Bonfire? What was Bonfire effort like 
then? How long did you and your buddies work on it?

22:57.698 --> 22:58.599
Seemed like forever. Really?

23:04.505 --> 23:08.188
In that particular era of time,

23:09.586 --> 23:20.001
Of course the bonfire, I guess, it was kind of 
looked on as a freshman endeavor and a senior

23:09.586 --> 23:20.001
endeavor. Those were the two classes that seemed 
to have some identity with any given bonfire. And

23:27.171 --> 23:32.438
so we, our bonfire, our fish bonfire was built on 
the, across from the MSC there. Drill field? Drill

23:37.325 --> 23:37.945
field. And it was the TP type that we're going back 
to, I think. And no mechanization, none. You know,

23:49.619 --> 23:53.884
I mean, everything was done by hand and slave labor 
type. Long lines of students with huge ropes, you

23:54.484 --> 23:57.868
know. Did you, were you in the cut area or the stack 
area? Both. I worked more in the stack area than I

24:03.940 --> 24:07.684
did at the cut area. Do you remember, was it rainy? 
It was weeks. It was weeks of effort. Yeah, as I

24:13.489 --> 24:22.538
remember now, when I say it seemed like forever, I 
understand that was with everything else that was

24:13.489 --> 24:22.538
going on. And no serious injuries. Not that I 
recall. Right, then

24:27.123 --> 24:32.648
yell practice. At the Grove, yeah, we went to yell 
practice. See, then we had yell practice. You left

24:43.557 --> 24:54.870
the dining room and went to yell practice twice

24:43.557 --> 24:54.870
a week. Was there also a midnight yell practice the 
night before the game in the stadium?

25:06.901 --> 25:07.822
I don't remember it. See, I don't think there was. I 
don't think so. Do you remember going to Muster as

25:09.765 --> 25:16.535
an undergraduate?

25:16.555 --> 25:20.600
Yeah, but it was, as an upperclassman, quite...

25:23.825 --> 25:28.892
I

25:23.825 --> 25:28.892
believe that was my...

25:31.842 --> 25:35.787
Fifth year here, the year before I finished vet 
school. Describe

25:36.027 --> 25:40.953
your freshman year. You all did go through final 
review and all that. Well, my freshman year in the

25:45.558 --> 25:48.242
spring. Oh, that you were here, yeah. As your 
sophomore, you went through all of that. Yeah, I

25:53.788 --> 25:54.569
went through. But I have very little recollection 
of it. Did you and your buddies attend the social

26:00.884 --> 26:04.308
events, the dances and all that? Some of them, 
yeah. And did you have some dates? Yeah. Where'd

26:09.193 --> 26:10.415
you get your date from? Well, TWU,

26:13.118 --> 26:24.971
and then there were, I dated, had dates with local 
girls two or three times. Where'd you meet them?

26:31.073 --> 26:44.928
church, and at that time I was,

26:31.073 --> 26:44.928
well it was the Baptist Student Union, that was the 
college. And that was an important Sunday night

26:45.148 --> 26:47.571
event, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah, and it was. Because 
there was food. And girls. And girls. And no

26:53.677 --> 26:55.139
hazing. Yeah. Held at the North Gate. Yeah. Do you 
remember Religious Emphasis Week? Yeah, very

27:01.345 --> 27:02.467
well. What was that like? Well, it was hectic in 
that everything, you know, if you attended these,

27:04.830 --> 27:24.216
many of the events, like in the dorms, and I 
remember, not my sophomore, Well, my sophomore

27:24.635 --> 27:35.548
year, we had a series leader, and I was in dorm two. 
And dorm two was one of the dorms that had a lounge

27:37.490 --> 27:41.175
area. And so that's where one of the religious week 
series was held. I can't tell you what was

27:49.084 --> 27:54.270
discussed, but I remember it. The thing I remember 
about it was that it was thought-provoking. And I

28:01.342 --> 28:12.597
must say that up to that point, you know, I really 
hadn't given any depth of thought to religious

28:01.342 --> 28:12.597
matters. So that religious emphasis week did have 
some positive results for you. Yeah, it sure did.

28:21.130 --> 28:24.274
My sophomore and... I guess I was more affected or 
more, I participated more or attended more my

28:26.077 --> 28:38.489
sophomore, junior, and senior years. Now, went to 
movies at Guyon Hall. Were there other events?

28:45.255 --> 28:49.139
There were programs, the equivalent of Opus. 
Okay. This was a student. Do you remember any

28:51.581 --> 28:52.582
famous? Town Hall was just started, I guess, 
probably. Guyon was still- Do you remember any

28:55.895 --> 29:00.001
famous celebrities that came to perform? Joni 
James and-

29:01.984 --> 29:14.783
Were the big bands still coming for the dances? 
Yeah, we had some of the dances. I can't remember-

29:18.629 --> 29:22.695
And G. Raleigh was already built? G. Raleigh 
White? He was built in 56, I think. Oh, really? 55 or

29:30.546 --> 29:31.328
56. So we're still over. We were at DeWare. At 
DeWare.

29:38.297 --> 29:41.241
Describe going to an Aggie football game. What was 
the routine on a Saturday?

29:48.492 --> 29:49.753
Y'all went to class all morning. We had class in the 
morning, yeah, and... And we just keyed on when we

29:54.333 --> 30:01.243
had to fall in formation to go to the game, to march 
into the game. And you did a march in. Yeah. And if

30:06.430 --> 30:10.696
you had a date, you met her in the stadium?

30:13.560 --> 30:15.042
Because she couldn't march in with you. That's 
right.

30:23.088 --> 30:30.197
And then what happened during the games for you 
fish and sophomores?

30:32.601 --> 30:33.622
Just lots of yelling. I don't think, while I was in 
the Corps, I don't think I had a day to do any games.

30:40.651 --> 30:43.855
Then when it was over, did you and your buddies 
participate in? As freshmen, we participated in

30:44.696 --> 30:49.503
hauling the yell leaders out. Then what did you all 
do on a Saturday night after a game?

30:55.927 --> 31:04.215
Oh, a big thing for us was just to not eat at the 
channel, go to North Gate or something like that.

31:04.315 --> 31:15.246
As a freshman, I remember we'd eat at one of the 
North Gate places, which, boy, were certainly

31:04.315 --> 31:15.246
not, that wasn't a memorable experience at all. 
All right, now, if somebody really wanted to party

31:15.907 --> 31:21.192
in those days, those nights, where did they go?
