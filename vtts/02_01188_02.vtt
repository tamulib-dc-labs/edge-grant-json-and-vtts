WEBVTT

00:06.781 --> 00:07.983
Well, can I talk? Sure. OK. So I really enjoyed 
visiting in their home.

00:16.273 --> 00:22.221
I remember when I first met Hannah, they adopted 
her after they came here. And so there she was. And

00:26.967 --> 00:35.158
she's a real sweet person.

00:35.178 --> 00:35.438
In fact, At that occasion, it also happened that 
Harlan's dissertation advisors, Cecilia

00:36.076 --> 00:46.526
Payne-Gaposchkin and Sergei, were visiting the 
family at that time. Oh, that must have been

00:46.546 --> 00:47.367
interesting. That was very interesting, because 
Sergei was telling all about his escape across the

00:47.387 --> 00:57.156
Black Sea after the revolution, and landing in 
Turkey. He had some strange ideas about Turkish

00:57.196 --> 01:05.644
language, which I knew were wrong, but I let him 
know. persistent as Polly, so to speak.

01:20.299 --> 01:31.834
Do you think, I think we'll probably all agree that 
Harlan is not what the general public expects from

01:20.299 --> 01:31.834
an observatory director in appearance, right? Do 
you think that in Texas, though, he's considered

01:32.287 --> 01:36.072
now? Oh, well, he fit into the Texas lifestyle 
quite easily, apparently.

01:45.265 --> 01:55.560
If you just take a look at all the people in Texas who 
seem to have had a high regard for Harlan, He knew

01:56.266 --> 02:05.702
how to get along with people, and he knew how to get 
them interested in astronomy, get them

01:56.266 --> 02:05.702
interested in what the observatory was doing. He 
was really great in that regard.

02:12.093 --> 02:15.439
Let me ask you first a question pertaining to you. 
you meet people and tell them what you do, what do

02:15.638 --> 02:19.603
they think? I mean, do they think astronomers are 
sponging off productive elements, or do they

02:19.623 --> 02:25.932
think it's a neat job? I have very seldom had a 
reaction such as you describe. Usually it's, oh,

02:30.038 --> 02:32.000
how interesting. And when I tell them about 
Hubble, they say, oh, well, what went wrong? Or,

02:38.670 --> 02:39.471
oh, yeah. But there's clearly a lot of interest in 
astronomy as astronomy. You know, people I've

02:45.558 --> 03:01.162
talked to on the planes, I'll get a picture or an 
article, they'll send me in the mail, you know,

02:45.558 --> 03:01.162
some insurance executive or what have you will 
say, this I thought you'd be interested in this.

03:01.823 --> 03:08.513
Because of course I give them my card, because 
that's how one does it, right? Exchange cards

03:08.613 --> 03:09.995
here, Ron?

03:14.182 --> 03:14.282
Okay. That's the cheapest form of advertisement 
that there is. Occasionally

03:19.358 --> 03:30.471
there'll be somebody who couldn't care less, but 
that's not the usual reaction. I ask that because

03:30.491 --> 03:35.036
one time I was trapped on a plane with Shirley 
MacLaine's advance lady. Oh dear. That was a

03:37.920 --> 03:41.704
difficult four hours.

03:45.278 --> 03:53.367
Well, you know, it's the sort of thing that I'm not 
going to justify astronomy on the basis of all the

03:45.278 --> 03:53.367
things that it does for mankind. It satisfies 
people's curiosity, and I think that's really its

03:53.987 --> 04:00.955
justification. Now, I've been asking this about 
planetary astronomy, but it applies in two other

04:00.975 --> 04:06.100
ways. One is the University of Texas Astronomy 
Department, and astronomers generally in this

04:06.280 --> 04:14.509
country There's no question that McDonald's and 
UT Austin have sold themselves well in this state.

04:19.807 --> 04:25.692
And, well, really, through Stardate, that's what 
people in Boston think of. They never heard. I

04:27.194 --> 04:29.936
don't know if UT has a medical school or a law school 
or anything. Probably don't care that it has a

04:31.237 --> 04:34.420
football team, but they know Stardate. But do you 
think American astronomers have sold as well as

04:36.763 --> 04:43.669
they have in Texas? As well as? What should they be 
doing? I don't know. I mean, this is personal

04:51.881 --> 04:58.468
opinion stuff, but I want to lighten up the book 
with some stuff. I really don't know how to answer

04:58.488 --> 05:00.510
that question. I've been asking everyone, this is 
their one chance, what do you think is the most

05:02.792 --> 05:10.500
important work you've done so far?

05:13.720 --> 05:15.943
They're going to carve something on your 
tombstone.

05:39.657 --> 05:40.318
Well, I... Keeping the astrometry team going 
through all the thick and thin of this problems

05:41.497 --> 05:54.510
that the telescope has had from the very 
beginning, I think, has been important. And

05:54.730 --> 05:56.773
finally starting to get some results. It's been 
the hardest thing that I've ever done, to put it

05:56.813 --> 06:01.537
that way. In terms of ultimate value to science, 
it's hard to say because we've still have our

06:08.412 --> 06:10.054
results to get. If we discover a planet around some 
star, that would be very interesting. That's a

06:19.323 --> 06:24.228
roll

06:19.323 --> 06:24.228
of the dice kind of situation. Some of my earlier 
stuff,

06:25.990 --> 06:37.322
well, I've done some interesting work in 
statistics in connection with the space

06:25.990 --> 06:37.322
telescope work, in fact. We have a very 
interesting computer program, which we

06:37.910 --> 06:52.492
developed, that really makes doing least squares 
problems extremely easy. Oh, well that sounds

06:52.512 --> 06:56.238
like a great boom to mankind. And it's got, there 
have been a lot of people, you know, that have been

06:56.258 --> 07:01.005
using it, and with profit. You can imagine, it's 
got, I mean, you can apply it to all sorts of things.

07:06.901 --> 07:08.824
So I'm kind of proud of that work. And

07:09.184 --> 07:29.576
the other things that have been sort of a 
cumulative thing, I don't know if there's any

07:09.184 --> 07:29.576
particular one paper that I could point to in some 
of my work on celestial mechanics. But taken

07:29.616 --> 07:34.984
together, I think that there's a lot of 
interesting research there. What do you think is

07:36.179 --> 07:47.602
going to happen to planetary astronomy, 
celestial mechanics, that sort of stuff now that

07:36.179 --> 07:47.602
budgets have leveled off or are decreasing? Well, 
celestial mechanics doesn't need a whole lot of

07:48.584 --> 07:52.011
money. in the sense that you need access to a 
computer primarily. Most of the interesting

07:58.984 --> 08:05.111
research is being done by massaging, you know, 
running computer programs these days. Well, I

08:05.191 --> 08:13.139
mean, I'm talking particularly here about are you 
still encouraging graduate students to enter the

08:05.191 --> 08:13.139
field or not? I encourage people to enter fields 
that they have interest in. I don't I've never, you

08:17.793 --> 08:29.887
know, either encouraged or discouraged a student 
from going into a particular area of astronomy or

08:17.793 --> 08:29.887
into astronomy itself based on whether or not 
they'll find a job at the end of it. I think that if

08:29.907 --> 08:33.891
you're good, there'll be a job. And the only way to 
find out if you're good is to try it and see.

08:41.780 --> 08:44.323
So I've had Several graduate students, they all 
have jobs at the moment. Gene Bird and Bob

08:49.733 --> 08:54.542
Harrington was my student also. I was going to say, 
I didn't mention this, but my grandfather had been

08:55.283 --> 09:09.028
a doctor in China from 1900 to Now there's some 
conflict about this, whether it was 1911 or 1913

09:09.312 --> 09:14.138
that he came back. My father always said 1913, but 
his older sister, who's still alive, Adelaide,

09:14.198 --> 09:22.608
said that it was 1911. So probably it was 1911. 
Interesting years in China. Right. This was just

09:30.037 --> 09:37.125
after the Boxer Revolution and just up until the 
1911 revolution. Anyhow, because of that China

09:38.101 --> 09:57.325
connection, and also because of the connection 
with my mother's roommate in college who had also

09:38.101 --> 09:57.325
grown up, been born and grown up in China, and three 
of my aunts born and grown up in China, or at least

09:38.101 --> 09:57.325
partly grown up in China, and going to my 
grandfather's house and seeing all these

09:57.963 --> 10:06.073
wonderful Chinese chinoiserie and stuff like 
that that he brought back with him. I have always

10:06.173 --> 10:14.282
been interested in China, studied Chinese when I 
was in college, studied it some more when I got

10:06.173 --> 10:14.282
here. And so that was yet another connection with 
Joan and Harlem, which I always was very fond of.

10:25.604 --> 10:30.030
Now, I know Harlan took a trip, at least, well, I 
remember the first one he took to China's

10:25.604 --> 10:30.030
Jonestown back there. Okay. Harlan went to China 
in, was it 77 or 78? That was the first trip of all the

10:36.860 --> 10:40.084
official astronomers. Schwarzschild went on the 
trip. All these other people went on the trip.

10:43.709 --> 10:44.951
Harlan was on that trip. Harlan and Joan went to 
China. And Joan will have to tell you when, but they

10:52.655 --> 10:57.260
did go to China, I think twice. Once in the 
mid-'80s. Because I remember him showing us

11:00.283 --> 11:08.632
pictures of this long, red colonnade garden, what 
do you call it? Gallery or something. And Joan used

11:09.093 --> 11:11.816
to play there as a kid.

11:14.338 --> 11:20.485
But they went there a second time, and I think it was 
like mid-'80s. And then they went there. in 1980.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.855
No, it would be 1990. They didn't go in 1989. They'd 
been thinking of going, but then Tiananmen

11:29.579 --> 11:32.544
happened. So I think they went the following year. 
That last trip, they climbed Tai Shan, or Mount

11:34.727 --> 11:41.477
Tai. which is a famous, one of the three famous 
sacred mountains in China. Is that the one where

11:46.409 --> 11:52.195
the two provinces are, east of the mountain and 
west of the mountain, you know, Shantan and

11:46.409 --> 11:52.195
Shaanxi? It could be. It could be. I'm not certain 
about that. Joan would know. I have not been to

11:56.700 --> 11:58.281
Taishan. But it is, it's a famous pilgrimage site. 
And, of course, during, for a long time people

12:02.145 --> 12:08.712
weren't going to it because, you know, one wasn't 
supposed to practice religion. Now that they've

12:08.772 --> 12:11.835
eased up on certain practices of religion, 
although China is still, you know, a totalitarian

12:12.440 --> 12:19.270
country, and one has to watch what one says. 
Nevertheless, people now do go in great numbers to

12:19.671 --> 12:24.097
that place. They climbed the mountain, as I 
understand, while they were there. So she has been

12:31.589 --> 12:32.730
there. She has been to her childhood home in China,

12:40.537 --> 12:42.379
I think it's Changsha.

12:45.784 --> 12:49.509
I think Changsha is where it was, but Joan will tell 
you about that. And in fact, I visited my

12:50.510 --> 12:55.998
grandfather's home in Shanghai when I was there 
the last time. Because, again, this is one of these

12:56.539 --> 12:59.903
funny things. I was at friends' meeting one day. 
Joan Smith was there. After the rise of meeting,

13:03.248 --> 13:07.894
Joan was talking with an elderly lady And she, I 
went over and it turned out they were talking about

13:08.566 --> 13:15.273
China. And it turned out that this lady had been 
born in Shanghai. And I said, oh, well, you know,

13:19.337 --> 13:22.681
three of my aunts were born in Shanghai. And she 
said, oh, well, who were they? And I said, well, I

13:24.342 --> 13:26.164
don't think you probably know them. Oh, well, I 
didn't know at that time how well connected all

13:26.184 --> 13:30.729
these old China people were. I said, well, 
they're, you know, Jeffries was the name. Oh, she

13:33.832 --> 13:36.615
said, I grew up in the Jeffries house. And she had in 
fact, her father had in fact taken my

13:37.473 --> 13:46.808
grandfather's job after my grandfather came back 
from China for health reasons. And so she knew

13:47.990 --> 13:50.374
where the house was. She had been to that house. She 
sent me detailed instructions on how to find it.

13:55.162 --> 13:56.384
Her name was Alice Walker. She lives in Hawaii or 
did it the last time I wrote her. And so she and

14:04.793 --> 14:11.088
enabled me to find this house, which is now a school 
in the old hospital compound. There's too many

14:11.268 --> 14:13.113
coincidences in this world. Isn't it? It's 
amazing. Let me tell you a story that doesn't have

14:14.576 --> 14:17.503
anything to do with China, but it has to.
