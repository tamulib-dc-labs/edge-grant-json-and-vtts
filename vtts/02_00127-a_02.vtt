WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:04.993
So while the mic was off on a half-time teaching. 
And on a half-time teaching appointment. Now

00:07.196 --> 00:13.725
officially then you were to be half-time 
research, half-time teaching. Right. For the

00:14.306 --> 00:15.187
nine months? For the 12 months. For the 12 months. I 
had a 12-month appointment. I did not teach during

00:18.291 --> 00:19.433
the summer. And what research facilities were you 
provided in those early years? We had a

00:26.525 --> 00:30.712
laboratory, a small laboratory, one desk and 
things of the sort. Provided some animal.

00:37.743 --> 00:41.550
And your, was your funding for the research? My 
funding for the research was, I had a good funding

00:42.111 --> 00:52.127
because researchers in this project, what they 
call S-10 Animal Breeding Project, It was a

00:52.681 --> 01:10.741
regional breeding project and I

00:52.681 --> 01:10.741
had most of my animals that I was dealing with were 
either at McGregor or on the high plains of Texas.

01:12.202 --> 01:15.786
I had some animals here and then I started going 
into sheep. nutrition and because I could get a

01:16.222 --> 01:30.600
grant in antibiotics, I was the first, I think, in 
the country to feed oriomycin or

01:16.222 --> 01:30.600
chlorotetracycline to sheep. That's an 
interesting anecdote that I'd like to tell about

01:32.783 --> 01:37.489
that first. Please, please do.

01:43.525 --> 01:59.119
One of the disease problems of sheep is that you... 
Well, at the time that I began most of my large

01:43.525 --> 01:59.119
animal work, there was what is known as the eye of 
the master fattens the animal. In other words, you

02:00.440 --> 02:08.827
have to have a person that goes in and observes 
animals, and particularly each animal, and then

02:00.440 --> 02:08.827
pulls feed away from them and do this kind of thing. 
And so we decided to self-feed. a fellow professor

02:12.618 --> 02:17.846
in animal science, a young man by the name of Bill 
Comlottie. He was the son of the famed Bill

02:19.308 --> 02:23.916
Comlottie in Illinois. He knew more about sheep 
than I ever knew in the rest of my life, but we got

02:23.936 --> 02:30.887
together and he said, let's self-feed him. And I 
said, okay. Now, nobody had ever self-fed a sheep

02:33.631 --> 02:36.295
before. So we brought the sheep in and divided them 
up and dumped the feed into some feeders. And sure

02:45.614 --> 02:48.962
enough, what happened was they died. They died of 
enterotoxemia, overeating disease.

02:57.040 --> 03:00.748
Well, Dr. Miller, Jack Miller, was head of the 
department at that particular point. And he

03:01.454 --> 03:05.198
called me in because he was supporting my 
research. He'd buy the animals and he'd hoped when

03:05.238 --> 03:10.563
I got through with them I could get the money back by 
selling them.

03:14.167 --> 03:15.628
We didn't mind anything. We fed them whatever we 
fed them and then took them to market. And we

03:21.114 --> 03:29.622
weren't worried about that particular point of 
things that might go and get into the food chain or

03:21.114 --> 03:29.622
things of that sort. At any rate, the animals died, 
and so he stood me up in the corner, and Bill

03:30.260 --> 03:41.421
Comlottie was in there, and he said, Harry, you 
don't know how to feed sheep. He says, I don't want

03:42.142 --> 03:45.107
you to do anything about feeding sheep again. I 
don't want you to ever feed sheep unless you go with

03:45.508 --> 03:48.413
Bill Comlottie. Well, Bill Comlottie had been 
absolutely quiet in the situation. So after Dr.

03:55.724 --> 04:00.627
Miller got through, I said, well, Dr. Miller, 
there's one thing you need to know. The only sheep

04:01.471 --> 04:04.384
that died were in the controls.

04:08.448 --> 04:18.823
we had now come up with a way which that went faster 
than anything else and even today they still use

04:08.448 --> 04:18.823
the same material. So a controlled self-feeding 
is that what you're saying? It was a controlled

04:22.468 --> 04:29.578
well the self-feeding everything was self-fed 
but the only animals that died Oh, and from

04:30.115 --> 04:36.146
anaerotoxemia were those that received no 
antibiotic. Oh, okay. And the antibiotic

04:37.769 --> 04:40.253
completely prevented disease. In those early 
years, how did a faculty member get evaluated and

04:41.756 --> 04:52.174
get any feedback from the department head or the 
dean about his performance? How did you know

04:53.403 --> 04:59.748
whether you were being viewed as mostly, I think, 
because of salary and promotion? But nobody

05:01.590 --> 05:10.598
called you in and as far as you knew, there was no 
written report. As far as I know, there was no

05:11.298 --> 05:15.262
written report as far as that's concerned. You 
see, I thought it was a little slow. I was promoted

05:19.926 --> 05:22.768
to assistant professor after four years here. You 
were an instructor. I was an associate professor.

05:26.116 --> 05:27.237
I mean, associate, okay. So you came as an 
assistant. I came as an assistant. Then four

05:30.260 --> 05:30.901
years. I was an associate after four years. And 
then two years later, I was a full professor. Six

05:35.065 --> 05:37.308
years out of, oh, that's fast. Yeah. And so I've 
spent, since that time, 1958 on, I have spent my

05:40.211 --> 05:46.878
life as a full professor. You may be the senior full 
professor around here. in terms of number of years

05:51.385 --> 05:54.047
as a full professor. As a full professor,

05:54.067 --> 06:01.053
yeah.

06:01.233 --> 06:18.588
During those years, was it like after I got here 
that normally the salary increases that mattered

06:01.233 --> 06:18.588
came the first year after the legislature met and 
then the second year of the biennium there wasn't

06:01.233 --> 06:18.588
much money for salary increases? That's about 
right. And your research and teaching continued.

06:25.353 --> 06:28.997
When did you begin to get in and headed toward the 
administration? Well, it started with the

06:29.017 --> 06:31.760
Century Study. Oh, okay. The Aspirations Report. 
The Aspirations Report. Oh, that's great. How did

06:37.106 --> 06:39.108
you get appointed? Do you have any idea? I have no 
idea. I just woke up one day and they said you were

06:40.890 --> 06:43.353
it. And I was chairman of the research committee. 
And yours truly was the secretary of the other part

06:49.216 --> 06:52.784
and he doesn't know how he got appointed either. It 
just and so we wrote the report and apparently it

06:55.109 --> 07:05.453
was strong enough that

06:55.109 --> 07:05.453
in Well, there was one other thing that happened. 
You see, up until 1960, I was single. Mm-hm. And I

07:13.034 --> 07:14.355
married in 1960. Okay. And the summer of 1962, I was 
invited to be a visiting professor at Cornell

07:15.236 --> 07:27.991
University to teach a course in biochemistry. 
Mm-hm. Well, I borrowed the notes from Mac

07:29.253 --> 07:36.802
Prescott and went on up and had a good time during 
the summer. Mm-hm. And they were looking at me

07:37.090 --> 07:40.736
pretty heavily. And I

07:40.956 --> 07:48.528
don't know, it wasn't anything formal or anything 
of a sort. But the day before I left, the head of

07:49.109 --> 07:53.195
department calls me up and says, we'd like to hire 
you. So I came back with a job offer. Again, there

07:59.665 --> 08:04.633
was no interview or anything in particular, any 
review or anything of a sort. Well, at that point,

08:05.710 --> 08:08.397
R.E. Patterson says, I want you to be, and Earl 
Rudder says, I want you to be associate director of

08:08.417 --> 08:14.754
the Experiment Station. This is 1962. And so by 
December 1, it was... associate director of the

08:23.243 --> 08:47.901
experiment station and so hey I was teaching you 
see at that particular point so Bill Ellis came

08:23.243 --> 08:47.901
down and taught my 303 of course and I was teaching 
the biochemical genetics course and I kept on with

08:23.243 --> 08:47.901
that until I finished but there was no one that 
could pick that one up until you know the semesters

08:23.243 --> 08:47.901
went on into January at that particular point in 
time. All right, now let's back up on the campus

08:51.345 --> 08:54.169
administration. When you came, who was the Dean of 
Agriculture? Charles Shepardson. Shepardson?

09:00.257 --> 09:00.758
Shepardson. Spell, I don't know that name. 
S-H-E-P... H-S-H-E-P-A-R-D-S-O-N, I think it

09:05.404 --> 09:10.912
is, Shepardson. And then when, who follows him?

09:21.682 --> 09:22.343
Jack Miller.

09:25.786 --> 09:27.408
And then Patterson? No. Gus Watkins as dean. Oh, 
okay. And Gus Watkins was demoted to, well, his

09:34.976 --> 09:46.187
title was demoted to director of agricultural 
instruction, and Patterson assumed the title of

09:34.976 --> 09:46.187
dean.

09:47.433 --> 10:04.714
And then when Artie Lewis, Don Lewis retired, he 
assumed the title of Director of the Experiment

09:47.433 --> 10:04.714
Station and I went in as Associate Dean, Associate 
Director. Alright, when in those, in the early

10:05.435 --> 10:14.807
50s,

10:05.435 --> 10:14.807
the administrative structure at that point The 
dean of agriculture, did the Experiment Station

10:15.715 --> 10:22.945
and Extension Service report to the dean in the 
early 50s? No. They were separate. They were

10:25.429 --> 10:27.352
separate. And for you and your colleagues in the 
50s, did you all have a perception of the president

10:27.973 --> 10:38.648
and how he was getting along? Who was president 
when you got here

10:39.489 --> 10:44.537
in the 50s? I don't recall. Gilchrist or Bolton?

10:50.700 --> 10:54.846
No, I think Gilchrist was chancellor at that 
particular point. Bolton probably. Mary Trax,

10:56.950 --> 10:57.871
Bolton. Yeah. Did you all see much of the entire 
administration? I saw. I paid little or no

11:02.598 --> 11:04.802
attention to the presidency. And did you see much 
of the board of directors it was then called? I saw

11:09.189 --> 11:10.871
absolutely nothing of it. And then Morgan, was 
here in the... David Morgan, yes. And he had some

11:18.467 --> 11:24.960
plans for changing A&M, but he didn't survive. Was 
there much sentiment among the faculty at that

11:26.664 --> 11:31.374
point? I didn't sense anything. Because you see, 
generally, I was doing my duty and I was trying to do

11:33.678 --> 11:38.846
this. And then when we had the opportunity for the 
central study, the centennial study, that was a

11:39.066 --> 11:50.583
point in which we could get our ideas put together. 
And of course, at that point, Earl Rudder was

11:51.003 --> 11:53.066
president. Do you remember any reaction when he 
was appointed president among faculty types?

12:01.707 --> 12:07.957
Well, I wondered what a guy who didn't have a PhD was 
going to do. You weren't acquainted with him at

12:08.037 --> 12:10.161
that time, were you? No, I was acquainted with him. 
How? I was

12:13.446 --> 12:17.673
in the Army Reserves. Oh, sure, sure. And I was in 
his division. Describe him as a reserve general.

12:27.070 --> 12:33.680
He was a magnificent reserve general, and so I 
began to know him, and we became acquainted there.

12:34.741 --> 12:40.330
And in a sense, I was one of the cronies that he 
appointed. And let's see, did you all go to Austin

12:42.312 --> 12:46.158
for meetings? No, we had our local meetings here, 
but for summer camp, we'd go to Fort Hood, North

12:47.600 --> 12:55.592
Fort Hood. And now your your appointment by him in 
the reserve was after he got here or did you know

12:55.825 --> 13:02.513
him? No no I knew him before he got here so I was well 
acquainted with him before he arrived and as a

13:02.754 --> 13:15.130
matter of fact they people would call me up and said 
what do you know about this guy Earl Rudder? And

13:15.150 --> 13:16.371
what would you have told them? I told them he's all 
right he'll work out describe him in personality

13:19.636 --> 13:26.236
and style and manner before he became president? I 
don't think it was much different from what that

13:27.620 --> 13:31.030
was because he was a politician then. And

13:32.663 --> 13:45.709
his remarkable situation was that he was doing 
things that he thought he could sell as a political

13:32.663 --> 13:45.709
man. Now, he didn't have to do that because he was a 
military man. And in the military, he was the boss.

13:51.461 --> 13:52.984
He was a commanding officer. He was a colonel when I 
first knew him and he got a star soon thereafter and

13:53.656 --> 14:14.770
I'm not sure when he got the second star but in the 
process it would but we'd run into him and he was

13:53.656 --> 14:14.770
then he was running for land commissioner I have a 
chance to run into him up there and we'd chat. I

14:19.594 --> 14:27.702
learned to know Margaret, and so I knew him before 
he came. All right, and when he came here, do you

14:28.283 --> 14:37.893
remember any early speeches or anything public 
that he did as the new president? Not really, no.

14:40.923 --> 14:41.884
No, I don't remember. Because I got here in the fall 
of 59 and I don't remember seeing much of him. No.

14:48.751 --> 14:58.302
And I remember him some, am I correct in 
remembering that he sometimes would mention that

14:48.751 --> 14:58.302
he didn't, wasn't very good at making speeches and 
he knew it? I suspect I've heard him say that, but I

14:59.763 --> 15:03.487
never paid much attention. That didn't bother me. 
Did he, did you all see him ever come around in the

15:04.809 --> 15:09.634
animal sciences building? No. Or should I say 
Animal Industries Building? Animal Industries.

15:14.173 --> 15:15.536
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't. But of course, 
O.D. Butler was a colonel, you know, a lieutenant

15:16.258 --> 15:20.127
colonel at that particular point. He was 
commanding officer and I was in O.D.' 's

15:25.700 --> 15:26.843
battalion. Was O.D. the department head of animal 
science by then? He became department head, I

15:30.478 --> 15:32.760
think, in 1956. Oh, okay. So he's department head. 
Yeah, that's when Jack Miller went over to be dean.

15:40.990 --> 15:50.040
All right, this committee, this century study and 
the aspirations report and so forth, describe as

15:40.990 --> 15:50.040
much as you can remember about that. Who, how, 
what, where, and so forth. Well,

15:58.531 --> 16:16.033
I remember meeting, and several times, Bill 
Barzac, the late Bill Barzac, was appointed, I

15:58.531 --> 16:16.033
called the Dean of Liberal Arts and asked for a 
person to work with me. And he appointed Bill

16:17.515 --> 16:23.801
Bartak, so Bill Bartak was the secretary and the 
guy who put it all together. And the person that

16:24.923 --> 16:33.371
seemed to stand out more than anybody else or two 
was Bruno Swalinski.

16:41.980 --> 16:43.522
Mm-hm. And The general consensus of that 
situation was that what we had to do was to move

16:44.633 --> 16:52.463
basically into science. And then at that point in 
time, I wrote a section on that on the research and

16:54.505 --> 17:06.179
extension centers that I call them research 
stations now or substations. That they needed to

17:07.040 --> 17:13.408
have extension people with them as well as they 
need to be education units as well as anything

17:07.040 --> 17:13.408
else. And that report

17:15.869 --> 17:34.215
was accepted, and I think pretty well accepted in 
total. It didn't have the conflicts that the

17:34.556 --> 17:37.240
teaching did.

17:40.164 --> 17:44.290
Because I was the secretary of that other half, I 
remember that. And your committee met about how

17:44.843 --> 17:46.787
often? Once a week? Once every week or once every 
couple of weeks or something of that sort. Eight,

17:53.761 --> 17:55.264
fifteen, eighteen members? About that. Was there 
any dissension that you remember at all in the...

17:57.949 --> 18:04.422
No, but there was some vigorous discussion. With 
Bruno there, obviously. And one of them said,

18:07.899 --> 18:10.842
we've got to do this kind of a thing. And I would sort 
of look up and wonder about it. Was there ever any

18:15.846 --> 18:28.777
attempt by any outside administrator, board 
member, a former student, or anybody else to

18:15.846 --> 18:28.777
interject something into the committee's 
actions? Not that I know of. I never heard of it

18:31.139 --> 18:32.700
either. Not that I know of. And no reporters? No 
reporters. And the report was given, summarized,

18:38.099 --> 18:54.702
and...

18:38.099 --> 18:54.702
And how did you all feel when officially, finally, 
all of this was, of the report was accepted? I

18:55.583 --> 18:58.287
thought we felt, we were, we expected it to be. What 
did you and your colleagues, what was the reaction

18:58.874 --> 19:12.495
when you heard about the recommendations of 
co-education, non-compulsory core, racial

18:58.874 --> 19:12.495
integration, broadened curriculum? I think 
fundamentally we were all in agreement with it. At

19:16.722 --> 19:17.403
least I was. I don't remember any campus. About 
that time the A&M Mothers Club had named me

19:22.050 --> 19:26.637
professor of at the time, and they had a luncheon 
for me here. And after the luncheon, Beverly made a

19:31.623 --> 19:40.217
few of them very angry because she was definitely 
for co-education. And of course, these mothers

19:41.560 --> 19:43.783
said, no, they wouldn't do that. So finally, 
Beverly said to these ladies, she said, suppose

19:44.384 --> 19:51.696
your daughter married one of these people. Would 
you deny her an education? The conversation

19:55.996 --> 19:57.238
stopped. I reported it to Errol Rudder and he says, 
good. But I think there were some other problems or

20:00.862 --> 20:10.495
some other situations that you know more about 
than I do. Did anyone ever in any manner contact you

20:10.856 --> 20:19.287
about the outside opposition to some of these 
changes? Never.

20:24.243 --> 20:24.303
No. How did you and your colleagues feel when the 
board officially adopted those changes? I think

20:32.221 --> 20:33.343
we were happy with it. Now the official 
recommendation was to change the name, as it had

20:35.247 --> 20:44.477
been in many other states, to Texas State 
University. I know. What did you all think about

20:46.039 --> 20:47.180
that? I think Texas A&M, good, why don't they get 
rid of that name? Come on, come on, let's go with it,

20:50.804 --> 20:54.869
what everybody else does. That was my, I think, the 
reaction generally. Do you know who made the

20:59.033 --> 21:04.039
actual recommendation of what we now have as the 
name? I think it was Earl Rutter, wasn't it? Wayne

21:06.863 --> 21:07.403
Hall. Wayne Hall. Mr. Rutter was very, very 
opposed to dropping the A&M. Hall's the one that

21:13.670 --> 21:25.221
came up with the variety that we now, that the A&M is 
not an abbreviation, but in effect a logo with an

21:13.670 --> 21:25.221
ampersand, not the A&D. And that the A and M are not 
abbreviations for agriculture and mechanical.

21:31.768 --> 21:34.330
Well, in the year 2001, I'm damn glad it happened. 
Yes. It is a unique situation. Well, after that, I

21:40.415 --> 21:46.176
said, well, you know, Texas A&M, Cornell,

21:47.911 --> 21:52.015
They were the two I could think of as far as names are 
concerned, a straight university. All right,

21:52.495 --> 21:58.781
now, and you were, began your administrative 
career now in 58? No, I began it at 62. 62, 62, okay.

22:04.246 --> 22:05.908
And what were your duties when you first? I was 
associate director of the agricultural

22:06.328 --> 22:08.490
experiments. And what did the associate director 
really do? Well, you began to approve projects,

22:10.512 --> 22:17.378
and you began to line up, and you suddenly realized 
that they were in charge of the budget. And one of

22:17.358 --> 22:28.436
the biggest things you did was prepare the budgets 
and I ended up doing the budgets for both teaching

22:17.358 --> 22:28.436
and research for the Experiment Station. I was 
really an assistant dean, associate dean as well.

22:32.984 --> 22:34.547
Although I didn't have the title. You reported to 
whom? Patterson. To Patterson. And he was

22:38.533 --> 22:40.617
director of the Experiment Station. He was 
director of the Experiment Station. And your

22:42.200 --> 22:43.562
offices were? In the Jack Williams Building. What 
we used to call the System Building. The System

22:48.651 --> 22:49.572
Building. And the Dean of Agriculture at that time 
Was that Gus? That was Gus and he was maneuvered

22:56.124 --> 23:04.633
into a position that took him to the Dominican 
Republic.

23:07.676 --> 23:17.125
And so Richard Potts, Dick Potts, came over as an 
assistant dean at that point and handled the

23:07.676 --> 23:17.125
students. So the dean's office actually moved 
over And Patterson then became director and dean?

23:24.128 --> 23:25.730
Director, dean and director. Dean and director. 
Now Extension Service remained separate and they

23:27.432 --> 23:47.878
were across the hall and they were in almost an 
autonomous kind of a thing and Patterson had his

23:27.432 --> 23:47.878
problems with that more than anything else 
because he was trying to downgrade the power of the

23:27.432 --> 23:47.878
county agent. And that didn't work, and the county 
ignored the boom on him. And so I don't know. He and

23:54.723 --> 24:01.058
Earl Rudder became cross with each other, and so he 
resigned in 1967. As the associate director of the

24:02.320 --> 24:10.631
Experiment Station, what were the problems that 
you had to cope with? Well, my problem was, and I

24:11.212 --> 24:23.569
guess I was a little nasty, because we took a trip by 
airplane.

24:25.355 --> 24:26.736
with the Board of Regents. And I was asked 
essentially to make a description of where we were

24:26.776 --> 24:34.504
going, and Patterson was sitting there doing it. 
So here we was, you know, I was separating it out.

24:41.550 --> 24:52.881
And Patterson, I guess he was, but he never, well,

24:41.550 --> 24:52.881
he wanted me to, incorporate the extension 
service under this and as you know that was never

24:53.165 --> 25:04.022
accomplished until year before last or last year. 
Now during those same years in the early 60s Mr.

25:04.042 --> 25:15.900
Rutter in fact became the chief executive officer 
of not only the campus but also the system. He was

25:15.920 --> 25:17.282
president of both. Yes. When that occurred, did 
that make the administrative task of you and your

25:18.555 --> 25:25.624
colleagues easier or more difficult? It made it 
different in the sense that the academic vice

25:27.347 --> 25:41.245
president, I reported to the academic vice 
president relative to the teaching end of things

25:27.347 --> 25:41.245
and the budget situation there. and all other 
matters I reported directly to Earl Rudder.

25:46.597 --> 25:54.425
Right, and although you were associate director 
at that time, were you in fact the chief academic

25:46.597 --> 25:54.425
officer for the Experiment Station? I think so. 
And you reported to Wayne Hall? For that

26:02.213 --> 26:03.855
Experiment Station, the dean. Oh, you reported to 
the dean. No, I did not become the chief executive

26:07.060 --> 26:26.989
officer of the college then, until the School of 
Agriculture, until September 1967, when I became

26:07.060 --> 26:26.989
acting dean and acting director. All right, now 
what led to that change? Well, Patterson's

26:30.334 --> 26:31.776
resignation. Oh, okay, all right. And as far as you 
know, what was the process that led to your being

26:33.487 --> 26:39.016
selected at that point? It was an interesting 
process because I was told by Earl Rudder I did not

26:41.099 --> 26:47.048
have a chance to become dean. He said, we're not 
going to make you dean. We're not going to make you

26:50.413 --> 26:51.815
dean and director. And

26:54.099 --> 27:00.709
said, then he followed up and says, who should we 
look at? Well, I gave Earl Rudder a number of names,

27:02.326 --> 27:10.536
several names, and I think every one of them they 
brought in for interview. As far as you know, who

27:12.018 --> 27:13.780
did the interviewing?

27:16.623 --> 27:17.604
Was it Clyde Wells? No, he wasn't chairman of the 
board at that point. I bet it was. It might have

27:23.151 --> 27:23.571
been. At any rate, it was board members. Board 
members. And Rudder? Rudder. And they, since that

27:32.691 --> 27:42.045
time, at least two of them have become chancellors 
or presidents of universities and things of that

27:32.691 --> 27:42.045
sort. So they weren't idled. And the last one that 
they interviewed simply told Rudder, said, hell,

27:44.929 --> 27:53.241
you got Harry Kunkel here, why don't you pick him? 
He's the most scholarly of them all. That was the

27:58.192 --> 27:58.973
process. Again, I never interviewed anybody for 
it. Earl Rudder just called me up one day and said,

28:04.144 --> 28:07.270
I'd like to make you the dean. And I said, well, give 
me a little time to think about it. So I went down,

28:10.917 --> 28:14.284
and Beverly walked in about that point, and I told 
her that. Describe, and so when you went over to

28:15.952 --> 28:20.440
chat with him, can you... Went up. His office. 
That's right. Can you describe the conversation

28:23.105 --> 28:28.175
when you chatted with him seriously about the 
task? No, he says, I want to make a dean as far as this

28:28.896 --> 28:31.401
is concerned. Did he give you any directions, 
guidance, advice? Yeah, I think so. He says,

28:37.097 --> 28:38.018
you're a young man. You ought to do so-and-so. He'd 
occasionally pop out. He says, you're a young man.

28:41.825 --> 28:42.746
You ought to do so-and-so. He'd pop up with certain 
directions, specifics of his advice. I don't

28:47.274 --> 28:50.819
remember, but generally they were good. Did he 
give you any don'ts? Don't do this, don't do that?

28:55.046 --> 28:55.527
No. Well, he'd just do something good. Now, this is 
1967. This is 1967. Well, by that time it was 1968.

29:03.824 --> 29:05.186
68. And so March the 1st, 1968.

29:10.634 --> 29:13.779
As far as you were aware at that point, was Mr. 
Rutter in good health? I thought he was.

29:19.126 --> 29:21.750
And who was the vice president for academic 
affairs then? Because Hall had gone, hadn't he?

29:25.245 --> 29:25.425
Who? Wayne Hall had gone to Washington, D.C. Bill 
Graff? Bill Graff, yeah. Was Bill Graff ever vice

29:34.719 --> 29:36.282
president? He was dean of... No, no, that's right. 
He was, yeah. Who? Dean of faculty. The

29:43.813 --> 29:46.337
geoscientists? that came from Chicago was he the 
he was he was academic vice president and describe

29:47.785 --> 30:02.605
the scope of your responsibilities as dean I mean 
as director I was chief executive officer of the

30:03.428 --> 30:08.414
college, or that was the college at that 
particular point in time. I was chief executive

30:09.155 --> 30:17.545
officer as acting

30:09.155 --> 30:17.545
director, and I remained acting director for five 
years. I was never officially appointed

30:17.846 --> 30:19.588
director. I never asked for it. But you still had 
the responsibility. I still had the

30:23.953 --> 30:25.215
responsibility. For five years I was an acting 
director. And so the experiment station

30:27.796 --> 30:33.422
essentially was under eye. And Hutchison, who was 
then, when I was named dean, was named associate

30:34.143 --> 30:48.860
dean, and he essentially was told to rip a port to 
me, which essentially worked out because he did.

30:48.880 --> 30:56.368
And

30:48.880 --> 30:56.368
did you inherit any particular problems that 
needed quick solution? No. I created the problem

31:01.796 --> 31:06.884
shortly thereafter. I asked Jarvis Miller to 
become assistant director. And why did you select

31:14.817 --> 31:16.420
Jarvis? Well, he was a freshman. He was a faculty 
member and he didn't have anything else to do.

31:22.927 --> 31:24.231
Okay. And so he was associate director reporting 
to you. He was assistant director. Assistant

31:30.046 --> 31:30.908
director. And then as he worked along, he seemed 
to, he and I seemed to get along very well, so I

31:31.029 --> 31:38.168
appointed him as associate.
