WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:09.005
in the office in the 8th floor of the Rudder Tower 
and I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with

00:02.377 --> 00:09.005
Weldon Kruger. Now I'm going to stop the machine 
and see if it's working.

00:16.215 --> 00:22.483
A minute ago I did not get on the machine that this is 
March 24. Weldon, why did you come to A&M in the

00:23.384 --> 00:27.028
first place? What led you here instead of 
somewhere else? Well, that's a good question. I

00:34.586 --> 00:35.748
grew up in Brenham. I wasn't sure I could go to 
college anywhere. I didn't realize that you could

00:40.074 --> 00:46.142
really work your way through a place like A&M like 
you could back in those days. And I was sort of

00:47.323 --> 01:01.122
oriented toward TU because my sister's husband, a 
veteran from World War II, was a student there, and

00:47.323 --> 01:01.122
they were particularly impressed with the 
university, I guess, and kept working on me. But

01:02.114 --> 01:09.001
there's a fellow by the name of Howard Perry who 
worked for A&M for a long time in Utah not too many

01:02.114 --> 01:09.001
years ago. He was a high school teacher of mine for a 
couple of years. And he kept talking about A&M. And

01:15.627 --> 01:25.137
I'm not sure whether he was the one in the end, but 
someone showed me or told me about the opportunity

01:15.627 --> 01:25.137
awards at A&M. And I remember that I got the forms to 
fill out quite late. I had to go over to the

01:28.960 --> 01:31.783
principal's house one evening get him to sign it so 
I could get it in the mail on time. And I won an

01:36.107 --> 01:43.454
opportunity award, and that was really, I guess, 
the final kicker that got me in this direction.

01:44.095 --> 01:45.777
That big award was how much money? Well, it was 
$1,000 over four years, so it was $250 a year, which

01:45.797 --> 01:56.207
was enough at that time to get me through school 
pretty well. I worked during the summers, and with

01:56.247 --> 02:01.753
that and the opportunity award, I didn't have to 
work when I was here on the campus. So that was good.

02:04.302 --> 02:08.566
Had you been to visit the campus before you decided 
you wanted to attend here? Well, as I say, I grew up

02:08.646 --> 02:13.291
in Brenham, so I'd been over here to the football 
games primarily. I hadn't really visited any of

02:13.311 --> 02:16.975
the academic things. I knew some other people at 
the Aggies. I also had made up my mind the same year

02:18.817 --> 02:27.145
in high school I wanted to be an engineer, a civil 
engineer, because that's the only engineer I knew

02:18.817 --> 02:27.145
about. Mainly I wanted to get some kind of 
education, and I wanted to go. So I knew Anand had a

02:31.990 --> 02:35.956
great engineering experience. This question 
won't be as meaningful to you as it is to other

02:36.917 --> 02:39.801
people. When you came the first time to enroll, how 
did you get here? Well, I came with a friend of mine

02:46.050 --> 02:49.294
from Brenham. And I drove over. My dad ran a 
business and had a truck. And so he and I came over in

02:56.885 --> 02:58.487
that truck. My dad was very sick that summer, and I 
was really running his business for him. So

03:02.877 --> 03:04.879
anyway, a friend of mine from high school came 
over. And I don't remember now whether we came to

03:06.021 --> 03:11.307
the campus, because we were going to be at the 
annex. That year, the so-called Riverside Campus

03:11.627 --> 03:16.994
was annexed. And I can't remember, but I think 
that's where we went and sort of signed up papers

03:17.014 --> 03:22.060
and everything. And then a couple of weeks later, 
when it was actually time to come over here to start

03:22.160 --> 03:27.546
school, his parents, both the two of us. What did 
you bring when you came to stay? What did you bring

03:34.651 --> 03:36.373
physically? What items? I didn't bring very much. 
I had a footlocker because that was one of the

03:40.199 --> 03:45.166
things that they told us that we had to have in the 
barracks. I didn't have really a very good, really

03:45.206 --> 03:55.000
wasn't a footlocker, it was sort of an oversized 
suitcase that I had. So whatever was in that, I

03:55.020 --> 03:57.163
guess, was what I had. I didn't have any TVs or 
radios or anything like that. I didn't need very

04:02.199 --> 04:04.723
much spare equipment. No typewriter or anything 
like that? No typewriter, no. All right. Please,

04:08.569 --> 04:16.020
because you're the first one we've chatted with 
about the Riverside campaign, about, you all

04:08.569 --> 04:16.020
called it the annex, didn't you? The annex, yeah. 
Yeah, yeah. Give me as great a picture of the annex

04:16.621 --> 04:20.988
and life at the annex and the routine as you can. 
Well, the annex was... An air force base during

04:25.728 --> 04:33.900
World War II had been built, one of these 
temporary, I mean, I guess the government knew it

04:25.728 --> 04:33.900
wasn't going to last. There were a series of 
barracks that were, we called them tarpaulin

04:33.920 --> 04:45.258
shacks, because the outside, well, they were 
wooden barracks, and the outside was covered with

04:33.920 --> 04:45.258
tarpaulin for the weather. They were very 
substantially built, quite warm in the winter.

04:52.812 --> 05:06.753
Behind the line of barracks were a line of 
latrines, and in the front was sort of a parade

04:52.812 --> 05:06.753
ground, and across from the parade ground was the 
assembly hall and a mess hall, several other

04:52.812 --> 05:06.753
buildings. And then we were fairly close to the 
hangars and the flight line, the hard stand in

05:07.854 --> 05:20.693
front of the hangars and all that, and every now and 
then that's where we would go out and march. But

05:21.517 --> 05:30.146
there was a road that went right down in front of all 
these barracks and that's where we had our morning

05:21.517 --> 05:30.146
and evening formations and march to the mess hall 
and that kind of thing. How many and how many of whom

05:30.166 --> 05:32.969
were out there? Well it was essentially all of the 
freshman class as far as students go. There were of

05:39.777 --> 05:48.607
course obviously a staff and there were faculty 
members that taught the classes, a military

05:39.777 --> 05:48.607
staff. I don't really know how many freshmen there 
were but the only freshmen that were not out there

05:50.238 --> 06:11.371
were I suppose people that had maybe military 
veterans and athletes because that's why I

05:50.238 --> 06:11.371
remember meeting several of my classmates that 
were athletes living in Hart Hall and places that

05:50.238 --> 06:11.371
would come out on the weekends to see friends of 
them. There were no sophomores? There were no

06:12.673 --> 06:13.915
sophomores. We had The freshman class out there 
was organized into military units, very similar

06:16.141 --> 06:21.527
to the Corps here. But we had our own officers. We 
sort of rotated, being platoon leaders or flight

06:23.730 --> 06:37.326
leaders or squadron leaders, company

06:23.730 --> 06:37.326
leaders, whatever. And they had a fish band out 
there that was formed, and you could start

06:37.346 --> 06:42.972
playing. It was quite interesting. We were 
bothered by sophomores and upperclassmen on

06:45.807 --> 06:50.775
weekends and other times. I think they were 
restricted, if I remember right, as to when they

06:50.855 --> 06:55.722
could come out. But I remember, I still remember a 
few names of particular ones that would come out,

06:55.742 --> 07:02.753
it seemed like, every weekend of the races. Let's 
see, a fish drill team. Didn't it get started out

07:06.686 --> 07:08.128
there? Fish band and the fish drill team? Yeah, I 
can't really remember. I think there was a fish

07:12.252 --> 07:14.034
drill team. Were there yell eaters? Did y'all? We 
had our own fish yell eaters, yeah. We had our own.

07:19.520 --> 07:24.245
Essentially, we followed the organization on the 
campus, but everything was done by freshmen. And

07:24.705 --> 07:28.049
all the courses that freshmen took? Every course I 
took that year, I took out there. Do you remember

07:32.028 --> 07:34.310
what those courses were? Well, I remember 
particularly taking English, 103 and 104. And in

07:38.634 --> 07:42.297
one of those classes, I had a lady professor. That 
was very unusual. It was the only one I ever had

07:43.418 --> 07:46.721
while I was here. Do you remember any of those 
teachers by name and qualities? I don't remember

07:52.686 --> 07:54.367
any names. I remember one professor that taught 
trigonometry. that had sort of a different

08:02.200 --> 08:08.586
approach to it, and he told us what he was going to 
do, and I thought it was marvelous the way he would

08:02.200 --> 08:08.586
do it. He told us that after about two weeks, he 
would go back and review what had been taught, and

08:10.008 --> 08:27.625
sort of, as he said, he found that people tend to lag 
behind the teacher sometimes, and they get

08:10.008 --> 08:27.625
completely lost. Anyway, he was very nice, and I 
thought he was an excellent professor. I can still

08:31.546 --> 08:34.710
sort of see him in my mind, but I don't remember his 
name at all. Harrison Hurth was one of the English

08:34.790 --> 08:38.374
teachers I know out there. They still live over 
here at Southside. Happy Harry would be his later

08:40.958 --> 08:43.461
nickname. I don't know whether... There's a man by 
the name, I believe, of Randolph that was sort of

08:44.923 --> 08:56.477
the head of the freshman orientation program and 
gave a lot of the talks, and he's still out there.

08:56.497 --> 09:00.642
But he was the one that said, I guess this is famous 
around here, but... He told us one first week we

09:01.482 --> 09:08.830
were there, all right, everybody look to your 
right and look to your left. And by the time you

09:08.850 --> 09:11.032
graduate, half of you will be gone. Just make sure 
you're one of the ones that's still here. So there

09:15.877 --> 09:18.019
was very little hazing. Very little. Y'all didn't 
do the duck walks and the push-ups and all that that

09:20.441 --> 09:25.927
would later be normal for freshmen. No. Push-ups 
and all that came much later. We didn't do that kind

09:29.523 --> 09:32.667
of thing. Describe a typical weekday, class day, 
from whenever getting up. Go through a whole day

09:41.980 --> 09:44.523
describing it, please. Well, I don't remember the 
time, but we were, I guess, awakened at a certain

09:47.087 --> 09:55.418
time in the morning by a bugle. And I had a morning 
formation, marched off to ,, came back and took

09:56.275 --> 10:10.588
care of whatever we needed to do, and then went to 
our classes, which were all during the week, plus

09:56.275 --> 10:10.588
Saturday morning. All the time I was at A&M, we had 
Saturday classes. And it depended out there on

10:14.251 --> 10:18.755
what your class schedule was. But they were all 
pretty compact, so you could move around pretty

10:18.795 --> 10:24.901
well from classroom to classroom. It wasn't like 
the big campus here. I do remember that it rained a

10:27.663 --> 10:30.185
heck of a lot. We all issued these ponchos that we 
called moving pup tents. And we had these helmet

10:35.451 --> 10:41.396
liners that we all issued. So it seemed like it 
rained an awful lot that year. Did you march to all

10:44.459 --> 10:45.701
meals? I'm not sure about the noon meal. I know we 
marched to morning and evening. What did you all do

10:52.687 --> 10:57.332
in the afternoons if you weren't in class?

10:57.852 --> 11:04.800
We had some core activities, core drills, just 
like they would at campus, like they do these days.

11:05.881 --> 11:09.085
And if you were in the band, you had band practice. 
You mentioned the fish drill team. I think there

11:10.287 --> 11:14.171
was a starter one out there, and they did that. 
Other than that, we would play ball, have our own

11:14.211 --> 11:23.522
little pick-up games, basketball and football in 
between the barracks. That kind of thing. What did

11:25.881 --> 11:29.427
you all do in the evenings once the sun went down? 
Well, after the noon meal and once the sun went

11:29.748 --> 11:40.668
down, I'm not sure that's the exact time, but soon 
thereafter, we were supposed to be in the barracks

11:29.748 --> 11:40.668
studying, and we were. And the, what we called 
attack officers, the military cavalry, they were

11:40.688 --> 11:48.582
out there and made sure that we were. And they would 
come around and check on things. And you were

11:52.218 --> 11:57.064
either in the barracks to study or you had to go out 
to the latrine. That was an excuse. And that went on

11:59.127 --> 12:02.351
until taps. And then you had about 30 minutes to get 
yourself ready for bed and be in bed with the lights

12:02.372 --> 12:08.159
out. And where did you all go on the weekends or any 
other time when you were off? When could you

12:16.962 --> 12:23.831
legally be off that campus? Legally, I'm not sure, 
but I think just on the weekends for court trips, we

12:23.851 --> 12:31.500
made those. We were very much encouraged to make 
them. I can't really remember for sure. I didn't

12:38.409 --> 12:41.814
have a vehicle, a car. Very few of us had a car when we 
were out there. There were very few cars. And I

12:46.865 --> 12:52.332
really didn't

12:46.865 --> 12:52.332
go. So I can't really remember for sure what the 
restrictions were. I do remember my dad passed

12:56.017 --> 13:02.285
away during that semester. And I guess maybe 
because I was going to have to miss some classes, I

13:02.305 --> 13:10.115
remember going down and talking to the military 
advisor and giving them essentially a pass. And I

13:10.135 --> 13:12.838
don't know whether he had to do that. I'm sure you 
would have to do that to leave during the middle of

13:13.426 --> 13:17.191
the week. I'm not sure about you. All right. Were 
there any kind of wild places where Aggie freshmen

13:17.932 --> 13:26.443
would go, whether legal or otherwise?

13:29.908 --> 13:35.335
You know, I really... Where did somebody go to buy 
whiskey? Buy whiskey? Well, I think Brazos County

13:37.698 --> 13:39.921
was dry. Mm-hmm. And... I don't remember anything 
across the bridge there on Highway 21, but there

13:43.632 --> 13:51.762
may have been something there. You could go to 
Caldwell and get

13:51.782 --> 13:59.492
whatever they did. I'm not sure they did. That's a 
pretty good piece. It wasn't like Whiskey Bridge

14:04.217 --> 14:06.200
out here on Highway 50. I don't remember anything 
like that anywhere. Now, did you all have Aggie

14:09.324 --> 14:11.226
slang? out there for food? Yeah, we were taught the 
typical Aggies course line that part of it's still

14:14.104 --> 14:24.695
used today. But you all didn't whip out? We whipped 
out. We were taught to whip out. No, but to each

14:28.820 --> 14:31.062
other out there? We were taught pretty early on to 
whip out to each other, get to know all your

14:31.182 --> 14:36.128
classmates. And we were certainly taught to whip 
out when the sophomores came out there on the

14:36.148 --> 14:41.213
weekend. You know, in that whipping out business, 
of course, that's the real basis for it, going way

14:41.935 --> 14:50.563
back, is to get to know everybody. Know where 
they're from and what they're taking, what their

14:50.583 --> 14:56.729
major is, that kind of thing. But I wanted to say 
this earlier. Looking back on it, and I've talked

15:00.333 --> 15:05.678
to a number of my classmates, our class is very 
close still. We're coming up on our 45th reunion.

15:09.627 --> 15:12.972
And a good part of that, I'm sure, is because we were 
all out there together. We got to know practically

15:13.593 --> 15:20.963
every one of us, most everybody, as opposed to 
being scattered on the campus. Even if you're in

15:22.145 --> 15:29.876
the Corps, you still don't get to know kids in the 
other units like you would when you're all out

15:22.145 --> 15:29.876
there and all those together. Discuss the 
diversity in that group. Were there any

15:32.820 --> 15:35.263
Hispanics? There were a number of Hispanics in our 
class. We didn't even think about diversity or

15:39.361 --> 15:42.324
minorities or anything. It was just they were 
there, and they were good friends and good people.

15:46.069 --> 15:46.469
Jewish? I'm sure they were. Yeah, in fact, I can 
think of a couple of those that were Jewish. Any

15:51.795 --> 15:55.159
Asian, Chinese? I don't remember any by 
appearance. There may have been some with foreign

15:58.643 --> 16:00.846
extraction. Any from another country? I don't 
remember any foreign students at that time. Let's

16:07.390 --> 16:09.012
see. How did you all dress for class? We dressed in 
the uniform of the day. And, you know, I didn't

16:14.720 --> 16:23.192
realize until just a few months ago that there were 
some civilian freshmen out there with us. And one

16:25.515 --> 16:29.120
boy that I ended up graduating with, I didn't 
realize it. I knew he wasn't in the Corps the whole

16:29.641 --> 16:32.004
time. I knew he had a physical disability. But when 
he came back, down here in Amon as a question with

16:36.787 --> 16:50.588
that disability, he and two or three friends of 
his, all from the same high school, convinced the

16:36.787 --> 16:50.588
authorities to let him come out there to the annex 
and be a part of everything and live with those

16:36.787 --> 16:50.588
other boys. And they sort of watched him and took 
care of him and all that. And so there were some

16:55.656 --> 16:57.859
civilians out there. And he didn't wear a uniform? 
He didn't. He was not in the corps because he

16:59.822 --> 17:03.267
couldn't pass the visitation. Can you describe 
any of the jokes or pranks or other good bull that

17:04.057 --> 17:11.764
you knew about during those days? Well, let me see 
if I can remember the right chemistry here, but I

17:12.906 --> 17:20.913
remember one time I blew up one of the latrines by 
flushing something down the toilet. And now I

17:20.933 --> 17:28.000
can't remember what the compound is, but it reacts 
pretty violently with water. And all you've got to

17:28.721 --> 17:33.085
do is drop it in there and flush and run about as fast 
as you can do, I guess, to get out of it. So that kind

17:33.892 --> 17:35.314
of thing went on. Were there any tricks played on 
other students? Yeah, there were always people

17:39.359 --> 17:43.665
that were mentioned earlier. The so-called 
bulls, the military advisors, they were trying to

17:43.725 --> 17:51.756
keep all the things under control.

17:54.479 --> 17:59.686
They had their hands full every now and then with 
one barracks trying to do something to the other

17:54.479 --> 17:59.686
barracks. All good, clean phone, but Now, did 
students out there have part-time jobs the way

18:02.714 --> 18:07.179
some on the campus did? I'm sure some, yeah. Some 
worked in the mess hall, I remember that. But there

18:10.002 --> 18:14.506
weren't too many, you know, if you think about it, 
there weren't too many jobs out there. I'm sure

18:15.027 --> 18:25.097
they worked a little bit with the ground 
maintenance crews and maybe even some of the

18:15.027 --> 18:25.097
repair crews, because like anything, you have to 
keep everything functioning. Now, this was the

18:25.117 --> 18:26.259
fall of? This would have been the fall of 1949. And 
that, was that, how many years had that, That

18:32.802 --> 18:36.407
wasn't the first year, was it? That wasn't the 
first year, but it was the last. Oh, it was the last

18:40.393 --> 18:41.514
year. It was the last year because that air base was 
reactivated in the Korean War. Then you came to the

18:47.383 --> 18:51.809
main campus as a sophomore. Tell about being a 
sophomore in the Corps. Okay. I thought I was very

18:56.696 --> 18:58.699
lucky. There was a... a junior in what at that time 
was called H-Air Force. It later became Squadron

19:08.398 --> 19:11.281
10, a core unit. And he came around talking to 
people. He said, I want to have the best unit on the

19:15.846 --> 19:19.691
campus next year. We want to win the General Moore 
trophy for the outstanding unit overall,

19:19.751 --> 19:27.981
academic, athletics, everything, marching, 
whatever. And so he recruited. with that in mind,

19:32.793 --> 19:39.943
and he made it known that, you know, if you wanted a 
bunch of bull, you weren't, you didn't need to come

19:32.793 --> 19:39.943
to that meeting. And I've always looked back on 
that and thought, isn't that marvelous? That guy

19:44.089 --> 19:54.685
had foresight, and we did win the general board 
that year, and two more years after that, three

19:44.089 --> 19:54.685
years running, and maybe beyond that, I don't 
know. I don't want to find out about that, because I

19:55.166 --> 19:58.851
remember talking one time to around Ray Bowen and 
mentioned Squadron 10. And he said, well, I was in

20:01.792 --> 20:03.294
Squadron 10. And I said, well, I don't know. Class 
of 58? And he said, well, you won the general

20:05.778 --> 20:07.841
military. So I've got to do some checking on it. But 
I know the three years I was in the Corps on the

20:09.624 --> 20:15.131
campus here, we won it. And I look back and say it was 
all due to that fellow that really got it started.

20:19.518 --> 20:20.459
Do you remember his name? Doug Hearn, down over in 
Blanco or somewhere around Blanco or something

20:22.883 --> 20:28.190
like that. Oh, now that might be important. In 
those days, it was the Air Force. It was just Army.

20:37.468 --> 20:38.169
It was just Army. And Air Force. So already there 
were Army, I mean already there were Air Force.

20:45.356 --> 20:46.217
Yes, yes. It was about, I'd say, roughly maybe a 
third or a little bit much of Air Force and Army. And

20:52.384 --> 20:55.127
the Army had all the branches. They had artillery, 
armor. How did the typical sophomore, your

20:59.817 --> 21:06.387
sophomore year, relate to freshman? Well, okay, 
we came to the campus and we were, you might say, we

21:07.308 --> 21:28.339
were the freshmen in the units in the main corps 
because the annex was closed down, but they

21:07.308 --> 21:28.339
brought the freshmen in to the northern part of the 
campus and kept them separate from the rest of the

21:07.308 --> 21:28.339
corps, sophomores, juniors, and seniors that 
were in what's called the new area in South

21:28.522 --> 21:50.222
Portland and they did have they did change though 
they they put a cadre of upperclassmen over with

21:28.522 --> 21:50.222
the freshmen and that went on the whole time that I 
was yeah even when my senior year that was still

21:28.522 --> 21:50.222
going on. Did you sophomores get to serve the 
juniors and seniors the way freshmen would have?

21:56.619 --> 21:58.882
No, not in my particular unit. There was some of 
that because we were the lowest classmen, and

21:58.902 --> 22:08.395
there was a little bit during meals and that kind of 
thing, but not very much. So, as I say, my

22:08.415 --> 22:21.293
particular unit, our company commander and first 
sergeant were so intent on excellence in all

22:08.415 --> 22:21.293
things, they weren't too pushy on a lot of the 
little stuff that All right, so then your unit

22:21.813 --> 22:28.601
didn't have much pranking and good bull and 
stunts? We had some. Do you remember any? Do you

22:32.125 --> 22:34.347
remember any here on the campus that are tellable? 
Well, you know, you always have the drown outs

22:34.848 --> 22:51.246
where somebody would come in your room and while 
you were asleep and gradually, sometimes

22:34.848 --> 22:51.246
gradually, sometimes just pour it on top of you, 
but usually just slide some water under you and let

22:34.848 --> 22:51.246
you sink in, that kind of thing. I remember one time 
when there was some tear gas used in the dormitory.

22:58.549 --> 23:08.699
And the deal there was you just, I don't know how 
people got tear gas, but you could just walk down

22:58.549 --> 23:08.699
the hall trailing it behind you and it took a while 
to vaporize and you'd be out of there before. And

23:08.719 --> 23:13.224
then you look back and all the people were coming 
out of the door and was crying. That kind of thing

23:13.244 --> 23:17.008
went on. But we didn't do a lot of things like I heard 
about when you came. Who were some of the memorable

23:21.972 --> 23:32.467
teachers, advisors, counselors, staff members 
that you remember from your student years? Well, I

23:33.649 --> 23:36.413
remember, I mentioned earlier Howard Perry. I 
remember he, I guess it was my sophomore year, he

23:36.433 --> 23:44.824
left Brenham and came over here and became a tack 
officer in the Corps. And I thought he became quite

23:46.086 --> 23:51.574
popular because he just had the knack of working 
with people and working with cadets. Some of the

23:52.229 --> 24:01.904
TAC officers weren't too popular, but he had the 
knack of giving you demerits and you'd smile about

23:52.229 --> 24:01.904
it. A little bit later, the dean of engineering, a 
fellow named Barlow, Dr. Barlow, who left before I

24:01.924 --> 24:18.291
graduated, but he did a lot of things with the 
students and they all thought he was top-notch. Of

24:18.311 --> 24:19.232
course, the president, Tom Harrington, he's very 
well known. Describe Dr. Harrington. Well, Dr.

24:24.623 --> 24:31.793
Harrington was a tall, angular kind of guy, very 
friendly. Had been a, I guess made his name in the

24:31.813 --> 24:38.583
first place as being an excellent chemistry 
professor. But by the time I got to know him, he was a

24:38.603 --> 24:41.467
top administrator. And I remember introducing 
him to my dad, who's now my wife, She was from

24:48.777 --> 24:52.221
McKinney, and he said, oh, a Collin County girl. 
And it turned out he had grown up in a little town of

24:53.463 --> 24:57.848
Plano up there. So they got along just fine. But I 
always liked Tom Harrington very much. I thought

25:05.197 --> 25:09.963
he did an outstanding job.

25:09.983 --> 25:12.086
Other faculty and staff? Well, I don't remember. 
Well, I do remember. I sort of said I don't remember

25:16.992 --> 25:18.514
any sophomore But I do remember a man that taught 
calculus in my sophomore year. And again, I can't

25:26.510 --> 25:27.891
remember his name. I can sort of see him in my mind. 
But I thought he was an excellent teacher. I can

25:35.958 --> 25:41.663
remember all the professors that I had over at 
Petroleum Engineering, because that was a fairly

25:35.958 --> 25:41.663
small department. And there were four or five 
professors, essentially. And I got to know them

25:48.245 --> 25:52.109
all very well. And when I stayed over the next few 
years and got my master's, I got to know them even

25:52.129 --> 25:55.733
better. So still. Why did you pick petroleum 
engineering? Well, I said way back there, I came

26:03.461 --> 26:06.765
over and wanted to be a civil engineer. And I got 
this opportunity award. And it was given by a man by

26:10.569 --> 26:15.214
the name of Toddy Lee Wynn from Dallas, who was in 
the petroleum bit. And it was for a petroleum

26:16.949 --> 26:20.973
engineer, and that bothered me. So I went to see 
E.E. McQuillan, who had been around the campus

26:22.595 --> 26:26.839
forever. He'd been the executive director of the 
Performing Students Association at one point. At

26:33.045 --> 26:40.712
that time was, I don't know what all he was doing, 
but at least he was in charge of the scholarships.

26:40.732 --> 26:46.618
So I went in to see Mr. McQuillan, and I said, I want 
to be a civil engineer. not a petroleum engineer.

26:49.152 --> 26:51.235
And this is for a petroleum engineer. And he said, 
well, my understanding is that all engineering

26:51.255 --> 26:59.666
students take the same courses the first year, 
probably the first two years. Is that right? And I

27:00.828 --> 27:03.531
said, well, that's what I think that's right. 
Well, why don't you just keep on going here, take

27:03.551 --> 27:14.966
those courses, and at the end, at some point, if you 
still want to be a civil engineer, we'll talk to Mr.

27:03.551 --> 27:14.966
Wynn about it and see what he did. Well, just the 
fact that I had this thing I got to looking around

27:17.142 --> 27:21.427
and thinking about petroleum. I even went over and 
talked to some people in the petroleum

27:21.447 --> 27:25.051
department. I got very interested in it and 
decided I went back to Mr. McClellan at the end of my

27:25.071 --> 27:31.038
freshman year and said, don't bother Mr. 
McClellan. I'm happy. I'm going to stay with

27:32.099 --> 27:35.002
petroleum and see how that goes. I've never 
regretted that at all. It turned out to be

27:37.325 --> 27:39.347
marvelous. Do you remember any of the faculty 
nicknames? Yes. There were quite a few. There was

27:47.686 --> 27:50.690
Cube Root Kent, Square Root Jackson. The 
nicknames and why? Well, I suppose those first two

27:55.115 --> 27:58.218
I mentioned were in the mathematics program. I'm 
not sure of that. I just remember the nickname.

28:02.544 --> 28:03.304
There was another guy. I won't even mention his 
last name, but he was known as Hose Nose for obvious

28:03.324 --> 28:07.069
reasons. He had a big, long nose. Another fellow, I 
won't mention his last name either. He was called

28:11.454 --> 28:14.858
Plumbob because he was sort of shaped like 
Plumbob. There were a number of names like that.

28:19.706 --> 28:23.670
Did you have any of the history teachers that had 
those nicknames? I don't think, I hate to tell you

28:24.271 --> 28:28.395
this, but I don't think I took a history course 
here. In those days it wasn't required. Well it

28:30.337 --> 28:37.424
was, but I took American history and I guess we have 
to take Texas history. I took them by

28:39.006 --> 28:40.728
correspondence in the summer. What were the rules

28:45.702 --> 28:55.212
of classroom attendance and behavior that you and 
your fellow students assumed? Well, attendance

28:55.232 --> 29:00.538
was very much encouraged by the different units in 
the Corps. And I should say, some encouraged it

29:00.658 --> 29:09.167
very much, the one I was in very, very much, and 
others not so much, unfortunately.

29:09.187 --> 29:13.431
But as far as if you were in the classroom,

29:14.170 --> 29:20.259
The professors made damn sure that you were 
behaving yourself, let's say that. Early on in

29:20.940 --> 29:30.374
some of the big lecture halls, chemistry and so on, 
two or three hundred students listening to a

29:20.940 --> 29:30.374
lecture, there were some people dozing and 
sleeping and whatever. And I guess the professor

29:31.335 --> 29:32.978
couldn't see everybody. But when you got into 
other classes, I know over in the petroleum

29:32.998 --> 29:41.711
department, if you nodded off, people walked down 
the aisle and waked you up. Make sure you were

29:41.731 --> 29:42.692
listening. Let's see, MSC, did it come into being? 
The MSC opened, it seemed like it was my freshman

29:52.028 --> 30:00.259
year, but it may have been my sophomore year when we 
had the grand opening. So we were very lucky to have

30:00.299 --> 30:02.041
that. What role did it play in student life? Well, 
it became sort of the living room of the campus, and

30:04.224 --> 30:08.730
that's the place you could go in. or fight to eat in 
the cafeteria, a different kind of thing from the

30:09.841 --> 30:16.309
mess hall. You could go there and the parents came 
and you could meet them there and take them there if

30:16.329 --> 30:22.537
they were here visiting. A girlfriend came, that 
would be a place, this kind of thing. It was also, at

30:25.321 --> 30:36.355
that time, we didn't have telephones in any of the 
rooms or any of the dorms, so if you wanted to make a

30:25.321 --> 30:36.355
telephone call or got a telephone call from 
somebody, The messenger came to get you if you got

30:36.740 --> 30:40.504
one, and you'd go to MSC. You had a bank of 
telephones there. It was always very much used in

30:42.787 --> 30:44.889
MSC. That's where you made your telephone calls. 
And MSC activities, what was included in the

30:48.073 --> 30:54.760
activities within there? Well, there was an MSC 
council, just like there is today. And I remember

31:00.086 --> 31:06.493
Lamar McLuhan, my class, was an MSC council 
chairman. I don't remember too much of the

31:07.790 --> 31:10.594
activities. I wasn't, I guess, directly 
involved. I wasn't on the council, I don't

31:14.219 --> 31:18.526
believe, my senior year. And I wasn't too much 
directly involved. I don't think it was just

31:20.168 --> 31:23.653
getting rolling, just getting started. We didn't 
have the number of programs that we have now. But we

31:26.798 --> 31:34.809
did have a cultural program called the Town Hall, 
which I think came under the MSC organization. And

31:34.829 --> 31:36.632
I was on the Town Hall committee.
