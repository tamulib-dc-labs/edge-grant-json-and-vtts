WEBVTT

00:01.290 --> 00:14.050
The innovation

00:01.290 --> 00:14.050
program, they had a thing called the TIG, 
Technology Innovation Group, and the thrust of

00:14.030 --> 00:21.460
this was to try to develop new technologies, and as 
it turned out, this focused largely on computer

00:21.440 --> 00:23.340
technology.

00:33.170 --> 00:40.690
And we had, I don't know how many cities we 
eventually worked with. I think it was something

00:40.750 --> 00:45.690
between 50 and 60 cities in the state of Texas. In 
addition to that, we had, through the NSF program,

00:45.670 --> 00:53.280
we became the backup agency to help Little Rock, 
Arkansas,

00:53.260 --> 01:08.890
and

00:53.260 --> 01:08.890
it was a tremendously successful program. And 
then in the, what, about 76, I guess it was, then we

01:09.870 --> 01:18.970
hired Don Moore, who replaced me as the director of 
the center. Of course, it went on up until... The

01:26.070 --> 01:36.620
early 80s, the federal funding report 
disappeared,

01:26.070 --> 01:36.620
things went downhill pretty rapidly. It was a 
separate center at that time, and I had nothing to

01:37.300 --> 01:42.920
do with it. I

01:43.140 --> 01:57.030
had to

01:43.140 --> 01:57.030
dry it up, and NSF supported dry it. And I guess, to 
me, one of the saddest elements of that whole thing

01:57.190 --> 02:09.720
was that the cities,

01:57.190 --> 02:09.720
I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised at 
that, but I was.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.120
We had, over the decade, in the 70s... It was the 
last half of it, and we had developed, I thought,

02:18.840 --> 02:28.300
excellent rapport with the cities. You know, 
they're very applied in their concerns, and you

02:28.280 --> 02:38.000
have to be careful about the words that you use in 
working with them. For example, we learned rather

02:39.980 --> 02:46.120
quickly, you don't say research, because when you 
say research, a city councilman in Abilene or

02:46.100 --> 02:52.340
whatever will conjure up some guy in a white coat 
surrounded by testicles. And they're not always

02:55.003 --> 02:57.060
going to find one. So we called

02:57.040 --> 03:01.360
it property solving. But in spite of that, and in 
spite of the fact that we had done, I thought, a hell

03:01.340 --> 03:05.360
of a lot of good things for the cities, Don Moore, 
and I was never a more able guy, would draw any

03:11.900 --> 03:18.850
support from the Texas cities to continue that. 
And when Dr. Porter took over TEAS,

03:18.830 --> 03:30.860
his edict was, if it can't be self-supporting, I'm 
not in

03:30.840 --> 03:38.550
the wrong view, frankly, but because this still is 
a land grant. I went to college. I

03:41.590 --> 03:51.880
think we still have. I went to him when the center 
was essentially giving, the program operation

03:51.860 --> 03:55.880
was essentially giving back to me with a 
recommendation that put some TEAS money into it to

03:55.860 --> 04:03.880
keep it going, because I thought that the federal 
funding would eventually swing, the pendulum

04:03.860 --> 04:08.880
would swing back the other way, and there would be 
money coming. I've seen these oscillations

04:13.860 --> 04:18.820
within the federal establishment before, and I 
thought it would be a good idea to do it again. But

04:22.340 --> 04:26.980
Skip wasn't interested in that. And with his 
background, I mean. So it, although it still

04:31.130 --> 04:48.470
exists on paper, and we still do thrust, but as

04:31.130 --> 04:48.470
you're aware, there is now a new center for affairs 
set up, which incidentally draws on some of the

04:54.450 --> 04:59.470
faculty that were involved with us in the Old Urban 
Program Center. And that's great. I think that

05:02.360 --> 05:04.950
will, it's nice to have that. The problem it will 
have is that there is no TEAS involved, so they

05:04.930 --> 05:10.950
don't have that money.

05:19.009 --> 05:27.930
So

05:19.009 --> 05:27.930
they're going to be scraping along with, and of 
course some of the liberal arts faculty and others

05:27.910 --> 05:33.930
are empowered to use some of their academic time 
for research. Professors

05:33.910 --> 05:50.680
are given release time from their teaching chores 
to do research. And so they can do, you know, so

05:50.660 --> 05:55.560
there are some guys in liberal arts that want to do 
that work with the cities.

05:59.540 --> 06:03.050
So in any event, that was too much detail, I'm sure, 
on the Center for. You hadn't really gotten enough

06:03.030 --> 06:04.051
on that. It was a fascinating time. Fascinating 
experience. The Center for Strategic

06:05.948 --> 06:07.050
Technology. How did that come about? Oh my land, 
how many more TEAS did you have? How much time did

06:09.030 --> 06:10.051
you have? We've got another hour. We've

06:11.030 --> 06:15.980
got another hour. We've got another hour. We've 
got another hour. We've got another hour. We've

06:19.620 --> 06:22.010
got another hour. We've got another hour. We've 
got another hour. We've got another hour. We've

06:26.390 --> 06:27.820
got another hour. We've got another hour. We've 
got another hour. We've got another hour. We've

06:30.800 --> 06:31.821
got another hour. Hours were a thing. You want the 
full story on that? Is this your idea? I'm sorry? Is

06:37.804 --> 06:38.640
this your idea? Oh

06:38.620 --> 06:45.080
yeah. Again, coupled with Mr.

06:45.120 --> 06:51.820
Benson. I guess the original ideas sprang from

06:51.800 --> 07:15.640
some things that Mr. Benson talked

06:51.800 --> 07:15.640
about. But before we started, we got several 
things done. We decided to record a video. We

07:18.100 --> 07:21.900
recorded a video. I had to do all three together. 
Alright. Let's go back. that began to occur in the

07:23.560 --> 07:30.060
mid-'70s, as I think the first time we started even 
verbalizing, he

07:30.040 --> 07:38.930
and I, notions that gradually, over a period of 
time, shaped themselves into what is now the

07:42.910 --> 07:45.930
Senate. I guess that was probably late-'74 and 
mid-'75. And the thrust of it was the following. It

07:56.790 --> 08:01.840
was clear that Texas A&M aspired to greatness. It 
wants to be a great university. And it was also

08:04.160 --> 08:09.450
clear that, as I've already said, back in the 50s it 
was a great educational institution, but it was a

08:13.430 --> 08:21.870
kind of insular sort of...

08:21.850 --> 08:26.870
It had very limited viewpoints, very limited 
outlook and outreach. And, of course, as the

08:26.850 --> 08:29.870
research program was started by Mr. Rutherford, 
and Mr. Benson had flowered, and, of course, that

08:33.850 --> 08:38.430
outreach effort expanded, and our worldly 
awareness, if you will, expanded. And there was

08:43.810 --> 08:47.830
also a realization that every greatness, again,

08:47.810 --> 08:59.430
if you look at it, what makes them great? Well, as 
we've already said, it's not their academics.

09:02.410 --> 09:04.430
It's part of the whole, yeah. The research

09:04.410 --> 09:14.490
program, yeah. But more than that, they apply 
their expertise to

09:17.100 --> 09:23.880
solve problems that are sort of like the old RAIN 
program, problems that are associated with

09:26.860 --> 09:31.440
national needs. And

09:31.420 --> 09:45.240
it also helps to have people appointed to high 
places. So you see Henry Kissinger come in the

09:45.220 --> 09:48.240
compartment, and

09:48.220 --> 10:00.130
that helps

09:48.220 --> 10:00.130
the image of greatness. And what this all boiled 
down to was that we wanted tribes to try to insert

10:05.610 --> 10:12.630
Texas A&M more into national and international 
affairs, more into attacking the great problems

10:14.610 --> 10:19.630
of our time, if you will. And it was just felt that in 
addition to having a damn good academic program,

10:28.550 --> 10:30.570
undergraduate and graduate, in addition to 
having a damn good research program, we wanted to,

10:36.550 --> 10:40.570
we wanted to insert ourselves into some of the 
national decision-making processes. And

10:43.550 --> 10:51.410
I remember writing Mr. Benson a memo back

10:51.390 --> 10:55.110
in, I think, 75, where I told him I was concerned 
about Texas A&M's image as, I think my words were, a

11:03.090 --> 11:08.280
football, military-oriented Cal College. An 
image that, to some extent, was deserved, but to a

11:10.260 --> 11:14.660
large extent was not deserved. And that I thought 
we needed to have a, I just called it a special

11:17.640 --> 11:23.760
research

11:17.640 --> 11:23.760
program, to be aimed at dispelling that image and 
creating a new image. And so I told him I had some

11:27.740 --> 11:32.190
notions I had about how to proceed with this. And so 
he,

11:34.420 --> 11:43.320
as I surveyed the faculty that was appropriate to 
it, and this has to be guys, I mean these have to be

11:47.380 --> 11:48.401
faculty members who have national

11:48.380 --> 11:55.880
or international reputation, people that were 
sort of our EF Hutton, you know, when they taught

11:57.860 --> 11:58.881
folks, listen,

11:58.860 --> 12:06.870
within the College of Engineering, I could count 
them again on the fingers of one finger. And so I

12:10.850 --> 12:15.300
told him that I thought we ought to get some money 
from our affluent graduates, Mr. Sackler and

12:19.280 --> 12:20.301
others, we

12:20.280 --> 12:28.310
always knew Mr. Sackler. And I thought we ought to 
get a little bundle of cash, well, maybe not such a

12:31.290 --> 12:34.130
little bundle, but we ought to go by the people that 
had it. And

12:37.490 --> 12:43.020
it doesn't take many, you know, you need some sort 
of critical mass, I mean, one guy's not going to get

12:45.700 --> 12:49.510
three or four, again, if you, if they were working 
in complementary areas, you

12:54.490 --> 12:59.890
couldn't have a guy who was, to some extent, you 
know, and,

13:00.870 --> 13:05.020
well, in any event, that was the thrust of that, and 
he thought that was great. And so he marched

13:11.810 --> 13:13.830
promptly over to the Dr. Williams office, laid it 
on him, and Dr. Williams thought it was great, but

13:18.600 --> 13:20.860
he said, it needs to be focused. Well, over the 
next, next few weeks and months, he focused it. And

13:31.500 --> 13:32.521
it now exists as the Center for Free Enterprise 
Research. And

13:36.500 --> 13:41.110
I'll never forget the day that that decision was 
made that it was going to be given to economics.

13:46.140 --> 13:49.080
Benson came into my office and with 
characteristic full head esteem knowing

13:52.400 --> 13:58.600
he was, and kind of as a sop, why,

13:59.580 --> 14:04.790
Benson, on

14:04.770 --> 14:09.790
the board. And don't misunderstand. We couldn't 
fault, and do not fault, the thrust of that center.

14:15.950 --> 14:19.970
It is, it is a very worthwhile thing to do. It's a job 
that needs to be done. It

14:23.350 --> 14:30.840
should be pursued. But

14:30.820 --> 14:41.510
nonetheless,

14:30.820 --> 14:41.510
operations sort of missed the target that we, and 
so during, that was set up about, what, 76, I think,

14:49.970 --> 14:50.991
or maybe 77, I can't remember. But over that next 
year, I can remember Mr. Benson would go to these

14:56.240 --> 14:58.260
meetings of that board of advisors and he would 
come back boiling every, because again, you know,

15:09.100 --> 15:11.120
it was sort of our idea that had been perverted. 
And,

15:13.100 --> 15:18.640
and so by, by 1977 then, he and I had agreed that we 
were going to make another run. Of course, the

15:26.800 --> 15:30.000
administration at that time, and, and Dr. 
Williams was out of the scene, out of the picture,

15:34.420 --> 15:44.310
and everything would have been

15:34.420 --> 15:44.310
taken over. And then some other, some other 
interesting things began to happen in 77. We had,

15:50.590 --> 15:54.610
we had begun to talk with various government 
people about this idea,

16:03.100 --> 16:05.120
trying to get them to help us shape the thing. So, we 
were visited in 77 by some fairly high-ranking

16:13.350 --> 16:19.890
Air Force men. They said that, you know, we need, I

16:23.870 --> 16:34.900
mean, to do several things. But the reason we need a 
new one is that most of the existing think tanks

16:39.970 --> 16:43.680
have become too institutionalized, or as they put 
it, one Air Force officer said, they have become so

16:48.820 --> 16:51.840
much a part of the Washington scene that they have 
begun to feed on one. We need a

16:54.030 --> 17:01.160
think tank that will do Soviet

17:01.140 --> 17:06.830
stuff. A lot of our Soviet, existing Soviet 
studies are too much based on the mirror image

17:10.810 --> 17:15.070
syndrome. And what that means is that a 
philosophical viewpoint which looks at the

17:19.300 --> 17:22.320
Soviets as mirror images of us, that, you know, 
fundamentally they're just like us. They, they

17:27.320 --> 17:29.340
think like us. They want the same things in the 
world as we do. They respond to pressures in the

17:32.540 --> 17:34.560
world as

17:34.540 --> 17:39.930
we do that. But it did,

17:50.150 --> 17:53.000
you know, take the graduate market. And so I've 
seen the mirror image syndrome in action now. I

17:55.980 --> 17:58.210
mean, it was exactly right. That's, because I 
remember thinking that myself when I was young

18:01.660 --> 18:02.681
again. And

18:02.660 --> 18:09.130
so, they then suggested that, that this new 
center, that we, still somewhat ill-formed in our

18:11.110 --> 18:15.880
mind, ought to have a very definite national 
security. And

18:18.860 --> 18:26.210
so

18:18.860 --> 18:26.210
that, that was reflected in the way the center was 
finally shaped. But, if you look at our charter,

18:32.470 --> 18:37.210
you will find that we are empowered in

18:37.190 --> 18:46.040
the urban system. Mr. Benson, bless his heart,

18:54.700 --> 18:56.720
and indeed, in the first year of our, and,

18:56.700 --> 19:07.580
and

18:56.700 --> 19:07.580
incidentally, he was, was and is, of the opinion 
that the state of Texas sort of lurches from crisis

19:12.560 --> 19:15.920
to crisis without any long-range police. The 
center's charter, an

19:21.040 --> 19:34.570
incredibly

19:21.040 --> 19:34.570
broad charter, here again, it's sort of a, and he 
gave us some money to get it started. And,

19:39.020 --> 19:50.170
he

19:39.020 --> 19:50.170
had his characteristic viewpoint about this. But 
he knew we were tackling, we were trying to slay a

19:52.150 --> 19:56.350
much larger dragon. And here, he

19:56.330 --> 20:17.600
said,

20:17.580 --> 20:19.600
so, it was really with that, with that, charter, 
that he took to the, to the Board of Regents in, in

20:26.410 --> 20:32.160
the spring of 78. I was, I'd been a, a visiting 
professor over at the American University in

20:35.140 --> 20:37.160
Cairo. And we didn't even have a name for the damn 
thing. We had seven names. And I remember when I was

20:41.630 --> 20:43.650
still in Cairo, he,

20:43.630 --> 20:48.280
we telexed back and forth. He had some other name 
for it. And, and I remember telexing, telexing and

20:54.020 --> 20:56.040
telling him that, that it ought to be called the 
Center Force. And so that was the name it went for.

21:04.100 --> 21:09.420
But he, he talked about the input we'd had from the 
Air Force officers and the national security

21:10.400 --> 21:12.420
issues. He told them that it was our intention to do 
classified work. It was our intention to work with

21:16.400 --> 21:18.420
the intelligence agencies. Well,

21:18.400 --> 21:23.790
can you imagine going to the Board of Regents of 
Berkeley and UC Berkeley with a proposal like

21:26.770 --> 21:28.790
that? Never in Christ's name. But with the rich 
military tradition in other words, Texas A&M. The

21:36.820 --> 21:38.481
Regents, two of them, said, Amen and Avenue. And 
so, set about building yet another new program.

21:48.580 --> 21:58.630
Then,

21:48.580 --> 21:58.630
Mr. Benson

21:48.580 --> 21:58.630
retired. And,

21:58.610 --> 22:12.520
to

21:58.610 --> 22:12.520
me,

22:12.500 --> 22:13.521
was maybe self-supporting. He

22:13.500 --> 22:20.120
didn't say that specifically, but that was the 
message. Well, um, the place where there is money

22:24.910 --> 22:27.074
is DOD. And so, uh, scrap. No

22:30.690 --> 22:47.350
credibility.

22:47.370 --> 22:47.450
And, and again, you know, the internet vision 
couldn't

22:53.420 --> 22:58.880
have happened without Teasman. And so now we, uh, 
we bring in about a million bucks a year. Uh, we have

23:03.230 --> 23:07.360
about a million dollars a year. Of that, I've got 
$90,000.

23:11.380 --> 23:13.400
And, and, and, and, I think the, uh, as of

23:17.160 --> 23:26.400
the 1st of August, the center will be five years 
old. We've had a fair amount of success. But again,

23:28.380 --> 23:30.400
it all starts with Teas. Now,

23:30.380 --> 23:34.440
the, the

23:34.420 --> 23:38.700
center's focus has narrowed, right? Because of, 
because of funding problems? Temporarily, yes. I

23:48.810 --> 23:50.830
mean, but, uh, but it is my intention to broaden it 
as I can. So, once you've got one area financially

23:52.810 --> 23:54.830
solvent, so. Right. And, and, and, and, and, and, 
and get Teas money to broaden that to the rural

24:02.810 --> 24:04.830
area. Well, uh, I don't know that we can, we can get 
Teas money to the, uh, I did get a, uh, this

24:10.810 --> 24:14.740
next year, they will give me $100.5, And that's a 
very, very

24:17.720 --> 24:22.990
slow process. I'm trying

24:22.970 --> 24:33.230
to pursue this, uh, we have had a couple little 
things, and see the, uh, when the

24:38.020 --> 24:43.910
center was formed, and,

24:44.890 --> 24:51.090
and, and, and,

24:58.560 --> 25:00.860
and, and, and, and, research division to take over 
TEKS. And so that was brought in to the Center for

25:12.740 --> 25:14.283
Education. Again, the thought being that that 
could be the focus of the economic

25:14.303 --> 25:27.690
development, industrial development.

25:45.732 --> 25:55.624
But yes, we will

25:45.732 --> 25:55.624
try to live up to the charter. I think our defense 
program is in relatively good shape. It's just a

26:06.546 --> 26:15.730
question of establishing credibility to get 
involved in these other areas. You

26:18.800 --> 26:27.481
talk about interdisciplinary.

26:28.363 --> 26:31.050
Mostly you're dealing with engineering before, 
but in this center you have to go outside of

26:31.030 --> 26:35.375
engineering as well. Is that a bigger problem, or 
is it pretty much the same as just getting

26:38.030 --> 26:41.050
engineers to go? It's

26:41.030 --> 26:55.780
basically the same problem there, but it has a 
little bit different connotation to it. Yeah,

26:58.682 --> 27:01.604
you're right. We have had in the center,

27:01.684 --> 27:37.650
in this

27:01.684 --> 27:37.650
center,

27:01.684 --> 27:37.650
people from the problems

27:01.684 --> 27:37.650
we encounter

27:37.630 --> 28:00.840
in that are,

27:37.630 --> 28:00.840
we still have this problem of,

27:37.630 --> 28:00.840
say we have a, he

27:37.630 --> 28:00.840
or she comes over and just does some really 
outstanding work for us. Our promotion is handled

28:10.510 --> 28:13.940
through the sociology department. So the only 
damn thing I can do, or do do, is to get them to work in

28:18.550 --> 28:32.200
the fall of the year when tenure and promotion 
concerns are operational, I write the dean and the

28:32.180 --> 28:40.680
department head of the program and give them an 
accounting of how that person has performed. And

28:43.450 --> 28:44.674
that's the most I can do.

28:49.370 --> 28:52.320
So I guess that's the most difficult problem we 
have. The other problem deals with classifying.

29:02.093 --> 29:04.200
And here again, you have to assess the attitude of 
the dean and department head. If they want, then

29:06.180 --> 29:21.000
you do that and get them involved in classifying.

29:26.728 --> 29:27.890
So on those, when we encounter that situation, 
we've had a few circumstances,

29:27.870 --> 29:35.420
political science, whom I will not, getting 
involved with us may be hazardous

29:35.400 --> 29:48.563
to your academic health. Of course, in that case, 
we have a department that is controlled not by the

29:52.450 --> 30:03.540
dean, none of

29:52.450 --> 30:03.540
whom are Soviet experts, none of whom give a flip 
for Soviet work. And so a young man ain't going to

30:07.925 --> 30:10.480
ride Soviet war to promotion and tenure.

30:18.768 --> 30:22.480
And so he has to be, in effect, a traitor to his own 
cause and over the hurdles that they set up for him,

30:22.460 --> 30:28.150
namely, you know, you will do such and such kind of 
work, you will publish in this journal and that

30:28.130 --> 30:40.028
journal,

30:28.130 --> 30:40.028
but not in... So in that case, then, go to a tenured 
full professor

30:40.510 --> 31:00.500
who has all of these things, and we have some of 
those. He's

31:03.244 --> 31:14.822
from Kansas State. Tremendous

31:14.842 --> 31:23.495
guy.

31:23.515 --> 31:26.980
Because he has, you know, he's got a summer fellow 
in his program, because many of these guys have

31:26.960 --> 31:38.559
nine months. And so he is here for his second 
summer. And then we support him in the National

31:41.767 --> 31:55.280
Research Center and in sponsoring work at 
Harvard, if it happens. Dr. Bill Zimmerman, the

32:02.084 --> 32:03.830
University of Michigan, Dr. Lee Bunton. He's 
going to Scotland. Oh, Erickson. Erickson.

32:22.296 --> 32:24.860
Well, I wasn't... He's not summer fellow, but 
that's a... That's a special case. But in any

32:28.072 --> 32:28.860
event, that's

32:28.840 --> 33:01.418
the general way we've solved that problem.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.400
Now, let me pursue this, because it may be of 
interest to

33:03.380 --> 33:19.860
whomever has suggested that we might go hire 
full-time research people instead of using

33:19.840 --> 33:24.875
faculty to staff our research teams. And he and I 
have had another rather serious disagreement

33:29.910 --> 33:34.940
over that, and don't misunderstand.

33:47.020 --> 33:51.180
But I have trouble with that, because, you know, my 
view is if we're going to have... Then why the hell

33:51.160 --> 33:56.957
not have a Southwest Research Institute? Or 
putting it the other way, my view is that anybody

34:01.390 --> 34:08.440
that our principal job as an institution is to... 
And you can talk about the research program, and

34:08.420 --> 34:14.300
you can influence international 
decision-making processes, but all of that. And

34:17.945 --> 34:34.850
so having a bunch of people that never see

34:17.945 --> 34:34.850
a student, never go into a classroom, I don't dig 
that enough. Great philosophical debate.

34:46.910 --> 34:54.930
But if we can't solve some of these other problems, 
if I can't get my hands on the faculty, then

34:54.910 --> 34:59.282
what am I to do? I guess I can either say, well, you 
know, we will attenuate the growth of the center to

35:05.640 --> 35:11.391
fit whatever we can draw on. We can go out and hire 
full-time. He

35:13.000 --> 35:30.280
and I had a rather serious discussion about that 
about six months ago, and I was ready to submit my

35:30.260 --> 35:36.390
resignation letter, because it was just 
philosophically not acceptable to me. But we came

35:36.370 --> 35:49.680
to an accommodation that as

35:36.370 --> 35:49.680
long as 50% of the program somehow impacts the 
teacher. So

35:49.660 --> 36:02.625
that's...

36:05.090 --> 36:09.758
The interdisciplinary problem is a far-reaching 
one. It has a lot of impact, as you can see from this

36:10.580 --> 36:14.649
discussion.

36:18.338 --> 36:23.690
And I don't know how to solve it, because certainly 
other colleges, other departments, have

36:23.670 --> 36:26.690
different views. Of

36:27.670 --> 36:40.330
course, there are those who think, you know, there 
are those who think that the center is a wrong

36:27.670 --> 36:40.330
operation. In other words, they will say, as soon 
as you take money from DOD, your soul, and I'll say

36:40.310 --> 36:49.240
your ass, is bought, that you're dancing to their 
tune. Well, I suppose with some

36:56.240 --> 37:03.080
that may be true. Now, it's true that

37:03.060 --> 37:10.776
DOD will do a specific piece of research. I mean, 
they will give you... Well, incredible as it may

37:11.700 --> 37:26.530
seem, I have got the literature. That's not 
strictly true. It has to be related to space

37:27.795 --> 37:36.190
things, within the space arena.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.912
Most of it. So

37:39.994 --> 37:55.473
they do specify the topics that we study.

37:57.835 --> 38:01.880
And I don't have any problem. So,

38:01.860 --> 38:25.100
clearly, if... And already, because of this test, 
we have never been again. How big do you want to be?

38:27.507 --> 38:35.710
Because I think he perceives that we could 
probably be almost as big as we wanted to be. And

38:35.690 --> 38:36.741
that's a good question. I don't know. My answer to 
him was a kind of a pat answer. An evasive answer,

38:40.690 --> 38:48.120
because I said to him that I want to be as big as we 
have to be to meet our service needs to Texas A&M.

38:56.527 --> 38:57.490
And I don't really know about that. There's

38:57.470 --> 39:13.290
no decision-making.

39:13.310 --> 39:21.000
I want to see more Texas A&M faculty testifying 
before it comes in Maryland. And it still works in

39:20.980 --> 39:27.841
Washington. And when Congress needs expertise, 
and law would be involved, there would be some guy

39:33.860 --> 39:42.290
for that.

39:42.270 --> 39:49.910
And there are times when a southwestern viewpoint 
on certain national... And that's not to say that

39:49.890 --> 39:55.610
we've got all the right answers. But

39:55.590 --> 40:12.850
you know, we've...

39:55.590 --> 40:12.850
You know, back in 20 years ago, we had guys like 
Lyndon Johnson, John Connery, and many others

40:12.830 --> 40:20.250
represented this area. Now, I wouldn't want to say 
that I supported those guys in everything they did

40:20.230 --> 40:30.200
or said, because I didn't. On the other hand, 
representing the area, they inserted

40:31.180 --> 40:47.760
points

40:31.180 --> 40:47.760
into the national. And

40:47.740 --> 40:55.334
now they're gone. They're still around, of 
course, but it's not influential anymore. And

40:56.660 --> 41:06.910
I think to some extent, you know, we can't fill 
those shoes. But to some extent, we ought to try. I

41:11.740 --> 41:16.970
think one of the things we can do is to represent the 
people of the state of Texas. In some of these

41:17.950 --> 41:23.090
matters.

41:23.070 --> 41:34.600
So,

41:23.070 --> 41:34.600
I want us to pursue them as aggressively as we can. 
You know, I've testified before Congress, but

41:34.580 --> 41:38.600
it's been a situation where I was sitting here, and 
a phone rang, and a friend of mine in Washington who

41:38.580 --> 41:46.920
knew that I had certain kinds of offers of 
testimony. Yeah, well, that's a passive system.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.818
And Aggies ain't passive. We're active. And so 
what I would like to do is to have a situation where

42:00.480 --> 42:08.820
we could understand what was going on in Congress 
and the issues that everybody confronted. And a

42:08.800 --> 42:17.840
certain area came up in which we had expertise 
within the center, within the college. We could

42:17.820 --> 42:23.130
put a guy on an airplane and get him up there. We 
could do research and do studies that, well,

42:23.110 --> 42:33.420
I don't know how big we could get. But clearly, one 
way or another, we are going to have to solve that.

42:37.550 --> 42:43.600
There aren't any of these issues. They almost

42:43.580 --> 42:56.370
always

42:43.580 --> 42:56.370
were breadth of disciplines. And so some of them 
we've got. What about Erickson? Well, of course,

43:03.470 --> 43:28.370
Erickson deserves a lot of credit for the success

43:03.470 --> 43:28.370
that

43:03.470 --> 43:28.370
he's

43:03.470 --> 43:28.370
done.

43:28.350 --> 43:39.390
I don't know how much you know about him.

43:39.370 --> 43:52.900
If you listed the top, he's a brilliant

43:39.370 --> 43:52.900
man. A genius. Speaks six languages full

43:56.409 --> 44:04.370
fine. His way through the DFW airport unaided. And 
just when a relationship

44:07.350 --> 44:19.930
with Erickson began, really,

44:19.910 --> 44:28.000
it had its roots in the productivity program, if 
you put it that way. I had been appointed to this Air

44:27.980 --> 44:34.400
Force oversight committee to look over the 
information. And

44:34.380 --> 44:50.010
a young Air Force captain who lived next door to a 
guy by the name of Colonel Lynn Henson, who is on our

44:49.990 --> 44:57.930
staff here,

44:49.990 --> 44:57.930
but he is on me. And Lynn had been selected as an Air 
Force research associate and had spent a year with

44:57.910 --> 45:06.110
John. And

45:06.090 --> 45:14.960
so through Air Force Captain, I got Lynn's name. 
And he was in the Pentagon at that time. He stopped

45:17.940 --> 45:23.600
by to see him. John was visiting. And then an 
interesting incident happened. You know, you

45:30.210 --> 45:32.230
look at these things, dear. You have to conclude 
that somebody upstairs is looking

45:32.210 --> 45:43.730
out for you. Has enjoyed support from

45:43.710 --> 45:54.460
the Pentagon. Of course, the Pentagon cannot give 
money directly to it. And so it has to be laundered,

45:59.640 --> 46:04.390
channeled through. At that time,

46:04.370 --> 46:11.790
the organization was...
