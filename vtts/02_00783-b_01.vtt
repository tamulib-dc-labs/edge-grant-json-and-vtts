WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:24.419
Seth,

00:01.634 --> 00:24.419
with the

00:01.634 --> 00:24.419
innovation

00:01.634 --> 00:24.419
program,

00:01.634 --> 00:24.419
they had a thing called

00:01.634 --> 00:24.419
the TIG, Technology Innovation Group. And the 
thrust of this was to try to develop new

00:24.439 --> 00:25.680
technologies. And as it turned out, this focused 
largely on computer technology in all those

00:25.700 --> 00:27.422
cities. waste

00:28.668 --> 00:46.285
disposal

00:28.668 --> 00:46.285
technologies and stuff like that. And we had I 
don't know how many cities we eventually worked

00:46.305 --> 00:50.229
with. I think it was something between 50 and 60 
cities in the state of Texas. In addition to that,

00:52.831 --> 00:58.557
we had through the NSF program, we created the 
backup agency to help Little Rock, Arkansas and So

00:59.093 --> 01:11.669
it was a tremendously successful program. And 
then in the, what, about 76, I guess it was, then we

01:11.689 --> 01:23.905
hired Don Moore, who replaced

01:11.689 --> 01:23.905
me as the director of the center. And of course, it 
went on up until the early 80s, and the federal

01:26.313 --> 01:38.328
funding report disappeared, and things went 
downhill pretty rapidly. It was a separate center

01:38.348 --> 01:53.106
at that time,

01:38.348 --> 01:53.106
and I

01:38.348 --> 01:53.106
had nothing to do with it. And then the HUD support 
dried up, and NSF support dried up, And I guess, to

01:57.211 --> 02:08.866
me, one of the saddest elements of that whole thing 
was that the

01:57.211 --> 02:08.866
cities wouldn't support us. And I guess I 
shouldn't have been too surprised at that, but I

02:08.886 --> 02:14.453
was.

02:15.835 --> 02:25.227
We had, over the decade

02:15.835 --> 02:25.227
of the 70s and certainly the last half of it, we had 
developed I thought excellent

02:26.185 --> 02:36.700
rapport with

02:26.185 --> 02:36.700
the cities. You know, they're very applied in 
their concerns. And you have to be careful about

02:41.447 --> 02:45.212
the words that you use in working with them. For 
example, we learned rather quickly, you don't say

02:45.232 --> 02:47.615
research. Because when you say research, a city 
councilman in Abilene or whatever will conjure up

02:47.635 --> 02:53.644
some guy in a white coat surrounded by test tubes. 
And they're not

02:54.839 --> 03:08.596
interested in

02:54.839 --> 03:08.596
funding any of it. So we called

03:08.616 --> 03:14.444
it property assault. But in spite of that, and in 
spite of the fact that we had done, I thought, a hell

03:14.464 --> 03:21.713
of a lot of good things for the cities, Don Moore, 
and I was never a more able guy, Don Moore was just

03:14.464 --> 03:21.713
unable to draw any support from the Texas cities to 
continue that. And when Dr. Porter took over TEAS,

03:25.484 --> 03:45.907
His

03:25.484 --> 03:45.907
edict was,

03:25.484 --> 03:45.907
if it can't be self-supporting, I'm not 
interested in supporting it. And I think it's

03:45.927 --> 03:50.192
wrong of you, frankly, but because this still is a 
land grant college, I think we still have a duty to

03:45.927 --> 03:50.192
help the people of the state of Texas, and I think 
that's one of the ways that we've done it. But I

03:51.168 --> 04:17.180
went

03:51.168 --> 04:17.180
to him

03:51.168 --> 04:17.180
when the Center was essentially giving, the 
program operation was essentially giving back to

03:51.168 --> 04:17.180
me with a recommendation that they would put some 
T's money into it to keep it going, because I

03:51.168 --> 04:17.180
thought that the federal funding would 
eventually swing, the pendulum would swing back

03:51.168 --> 04:17.180
the other way, and there would be money coming. I 
mean, I've seen these oscillations within the

04:17.200 --> 04:19.403
federal establishment before, and I thought it 
would work out. But Skip wasn't interested in

04:20.395 --> 04:26.802
that. And with his background, I do not understand 
that. So it, although it still exists on paper, and

04:32.108 --> 04:40.957
we still do a few little things. We did, a couple of 
years ago, we did some things for the City of

04:40.977 --> 04:44.361
Edinburgh and South Texas. So we still have that 
thrust. But as you're aware, there is now a new

04:47.254 --> 05:01.949
center for affairs set up, which incidentally 
draws on some of the faculty that were involved

04:47.254 --> 05:01.949
with us in the old urban program center. And that's 
great. I think that will, it's nice to have that.

05:06.233 --> 05:10.077
The problem it will have is that there is no P's 
involved. So they won't have that money. And

05:12.100 --> 05:37.806
so they're going to be scraping along with, you 
know, the organized research and the Office of

05:12.100 --> 05:37.806
University Research for operation. And, of 
course, some of the liberal arts faculty and

05:37.826 --> 05:40.269
others are empowered to use some of their academic 
time for research. It's different than it is here

05:40.289 --> 05:41.290
at TEAS, of course. We want to do research. But over 
there, professors are given release time from

05:42.644 --> 05:51.486
their teaching chores to do research. And so they 
can do some things. So there are some guys in

05:54.273 --> 05:57.341
liberal arts that want to do that work with the 
cities. There are a couple, three guys in business

05:57.361 --> 06:00.028
administration And, of course, Rossler in urban 
planning and urban architecture. And these are

06:06.964 --> 06:15.654
the same people, at least the same organizations

06:06.964 --> 06:15.654
that we have involved in the arts of the city. So, in 
any event, that's too much detail, I'm sure, on the

06:15.674 --> 06:25.065
Center for Rural Affairs. Hadn't really gotten 
enough on that 2%. It was a fascinating time,

06:28.570 --> 06:29.831
fascinating experience. The Center for 
Strategic Technology, How did that come about?

06:34.200 --> 06:34.661
Oh, my land. How many more takes did you have? How 
much time did you have? We've got another hour.

06:38.064 --> 06:38.805
Hours worth of things. So...

06:39.706 --> 06:44.832
Oh, my land. Do you want the full story on that? I 
don't want to

06:47.935 --> 06:52.039
get that. Well... Is this your idea? I'm sorry? Was 
this your idea? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I guess. Again,

07:01.349 --> 07:07.455
coupled with Mr. Benson, he deserves credit.

07:12.600 --> 07:27.795
Well, I guess the original ideas

07:12.600 --> 07:27.795
sprang from some things that began to occur in the 
mid-70s. Because I think the first time we started

07:30.037 --> 07:46.214
even verbalizing he and

07:30.037 --> 07:46.214
I, notions that gradually over a period of time 
shaped themselves into what is now the center. I

07:46.234 --> 07:50.518
guess that was probably late 74 and mid-75. And the 
thrust of it was the following. It was clear that

07:56.311 --> 08:02.241
Texas A&M aspired to greatness. It wants to be a 
great university. And it was also clear that, you

08:06.568 --> 08:20.530
know, as I've already said, back in the 50s it was a 
great educational institution, but it was a kind

08:06.568 --> 08:20.530
of an insular sort of had very limited viewpoints, 
very limited outlook and outreach. And, of

08:27.662 --> 08:43.568
course, as the research program was started by Mr. 
Rutter and Mr. Parson and flowered, of course,

08:27.662 --> 08:43.568
that outreach effort expanded, and our worldly 
awareness,

08:27.662 --> 08:43.568
if you will, expanded. And there was also a 
realization that every great man Again,

08:47.645 --> 09:10.491
if you look

08:47.645 --> 09:10.491
at MIT and Stanford, it's kind of different. What 
makes them great? Well, as we've already said,

09:10.971 --> 09:14.776
it's not their academic programs, but most part of 
the old, yeah, graduate programs, but certainly

09:10.971 --> 09:14.776
not undergraduate programs, where you just get a 
list of them. And research programs, yeah, but

09:14.796 --> 09:15.897
more than that, They apply their expertise

09:17.260 --> 09:37.243
to solve problems that are sort of like the old RAIN 
program, problems that are associated with

09:17.260 --> 09:37.243
national

09:17.260 --> 09:37.243
needs.

09:40.430 --> 09:58.373
And it also helps to have people

09:40.430 --> 09:58.373
appointed to high places. So you see Henry 
Kissinger coming from Harvard, and the

09:58.393 --> 10:00.936
secretaries of defense from MIT, and that helps 
the image of greatness. And what this all boiled

10:02.266 --> 10:23.756
down to was that we wanted to try to insert Texas A&M 
more into national and international affairs,

10:02.266 --> 10:23.756
more into attacking the great

10:02.266 --> 10:23.756
problems of our time, if you want to be that 
grandiose about it. And it was just felt that in

10:23.776 --> 10:30.045
addition to having a damn good academic program, 
undergraduate and graduate, In addition to

10:30.548 --> 10:49.851
having a damn good research program, we wanted to 
insert ourselves into some of the national

10:30.548 --> 10:49.851
decision

10:30.548 --> 10:49.851
making processes. And I remember writing Mr. 
Benson a memo back

10:49.871 --> 11:00.184
in, I think, 75, where I told him I was concerned 
about Texas A&M's image think

11:01.109 --> 11:24.278
my words were

11:01.109 --> 11:24.278
a football, military-oriented Cal College. An 
image that to some extent was deserved, but to a

11:24.298 --> 11:26.961
large extent was not deserved. And that I thought 
we needed to have a, I just called it a special

11:26.981 --> 11:30.325
research program that would be aimed at 
dispelling that image and creating a new image.

11:30.345 --> 11:30.846
And so I told him I'd some

11:31.231 --> 11:53.004
mentions

11:31.231 --> 11:53.004
I had

11:31.231 --> 11:53.004
about

11:31.231 --> 11:53.004
how to proceed with this. And so he, I told him that 
as I surveyed the faculty that was appropriate to

11:53.024 --> 11:57.611
this effort, and this has to be guys, I mean these 
have to be faculty members who have national or

11:53.024 --> 11:57.611
international reputation. People that were sort 
of like E.F. Hutton, you know, when they talk,

11:57.631 --> 11:59.854
folks listen. We

12:01.336 --> 12:17.320
didn't

12:01.336 --> 12:17.320
have them. Within the College of Engineering, I 
could count

12:17.340 --> 12:25.232
them again on the things that went down. And so I 
told him that I thought we ought to get some money

12:25.252 --> 12:27.435
from our affluent graduates, like Mr. Sackler. In 
other words, we always knew Mr. Sackler would know

12:27.455 --> 12:29.518
that we needed money, and he always gives it. And I 
thought we ought to get a little bundle of cash

12:31.103 --> 12:51.050
Well,

12:31.103 --> 12:51.050
maybe not such

12:31.103 --> 12:51.050
a little bunch. And we ought to go by people. People 
that have clout, people that have international

12:51.671 --> 12:53.774
expertise. And it doesn't take many. You need some 
sort of critical mass. I mean, one guy's not going

12:55.636 --> 12:56.918
to make it, but three or four, yeah. Again, if they 
were working in complementary areas, you

12:56.938 --> 12:59.001
couldn't have a guy here and another guy there. to 
some extent

12:59.690 --> 13:09.484
of Milwaukee

12:59.690 --> 13:09.484
tea. Well, in any event, that was the thrust of that 
memo. And he thought that was great. And so he

13:18.677 --> 13:21.241
marched promptly over to the Dr. Williams office, 
laid it on him, and Dr. Williams thought it was

13:18.677 --> 13:21.241
great. But he said, it needs to be focused. Well, 
over the next... the

13:26.673 --> 13:48.804
next few

13:26.673 --> 13:48.804
weeks

13:26.673 --> 13:48.804
and months defocused it. And it now exists as the 
Center for Free Enterprise Research and

13:48.865 --> 13:51.809
Education. And I'll never forget the day that that 
decision was made that it was going to be given to

13:51.829 --> 13:53.852
economics. Mr. Benson came into my office and with 
a characteristic full head esteem, he was livid.

13:58.870 --> 14:11.403
And kind of as a sop, why

13:58.870 --> 14:11.403
Dr. Williams

13:58.870 --> 14:11.403
had put Mr. Benson on the Board of Advisors or 
something before that. And don't misunderstand.

14:11.923 --> 14:17.129
We couldn't fault and do not fault the thrust of 
that Senate. It is a very worthwhile thing to do,

14:17.149 --> 14:25.317
and it's a job that needs to be done.

14:27.980 --> 14:31.685
It should be pursued. It should be pursued more 
aggressively, frankly, than I think it would be

14:31.705 --> 14:36.753
pursued right now. But nonetheless, that 
operation sort of missed the target that we had

14:36.773 --> 14:46.186
originally identified. And so during, that was 
set up about, what, 76, I think, or maybe 77, I can't

14:46.206 --> 14:53.196
remember. But over that next year, I can remember 
Mr. Benson would go to these meetings of that board

14:55.385 --> 15:07.660
of advisors, and he would come back boiling every 
time. And because, again, it was sort of our idea

15:07.680 --> 15:15.749
that had been perverted.

15:16.971 --> 15:22.337
And so by 1977,

15:16.971 --> 15:22.337
then, He and I had agreed

15:23.195 --> 15:36.587
that we

15:23.195 --> 15:36.587
were going

15:23.195 --> 15:36.587
to make another run. Of course, we

15:36.607 --> 15:49.458
had a new administration at that time, and Dr. 
Williams was out of the scene, out of the picture,

15:36.607 --> 15:49.458
and Barry Smith had taken over. And then some other 
interesting things began to happen in 1977. We had

15:52.237 --> 16:07.838
we had begun to talk with various government 
people about this idea,

15:52.237 --> 16:07.838
and trying to get them to help us shape the thing. 
And so we were visited in 77 by some fairly

16:07.858 --> 16:21.417
high-ranking Air Force men, and they said that You 
know, we

16:21.734 --> 16:44.402
need a new think tank, a new defense-related think 
tank to do several things. But the reason we need a

16:44.422 --> 16:51.471
new one is that most of the existing think tanks 
have become too institutionalized, or as they put

16:44.422 --> 16:51.471
it, one Air Force officer said, they have become so 
much a part of the Washington scene that they have

16:52.295 --> 17:04.127
begun to feed on, and we're not getting any fresh 
things out of them. We need a think tank that will do

17:04.147 --> 17:15.619
Soviet studies because a lot of our Soviet, 
existing Soviet studies are too much based on the

17:04.147 --> 17:15.619
mirror image

17:04.147 --> 17:15.619
syndrome. And what that means is that a

17:17.202 --> 17:42.453
philosophical

17:17.202 --> 17:42.453
viewpoint which looks at the Soviets as mirror 
images of us, that fundamentally they're just

17:17.202 --> 17:42.453
like us. They think like us. They want the same 
things in the world as we do. They respond to

17:43.854 --> 17:44.816
pressures in the world as we do. Of course, that's 
not true. But it did. And I did my first Soviet piece

17:45.637 --> 17:46.838
of Soviet work back in 1952. and

17:47.425 --> 18:08.397
before

17:47.425 --> 18:08.397
I went back to Ohio State for graduate work, and so 
I'd seen the Mirror

17:47.425 --> 18:08.397
Image Syndrome in action, and it was exactly 
right. Because I remember thinking that myself

18:08.417 --> 18:09.819
when I was young and ignorant. And so they then 
suggested that this new center that we had still

18:12.704 --> 18:29.492
somewhat

18:12.704 --> 18:29.492
ill-formed

18:12.704 --> 18:29.492
in our mind, ought to have a very definite national 
security thrust to it. And so that was reflected in

18:29.512 --> 18:31.475
the way the Senate was finally shaped. But if you 
look at our charter, you will find that we are

18:34.844 --> 18:59.729
empowered to

18:34.844 --> 18:59.729
look at energy

18:34.844 --> 18:59.729
systems, transportation systems, urban 
systems. Mr. Benson, bless his heart, thought

18:59.749 --> 19:01.511
that the Santa Rosa knew all kinds of great things. 
And indeed, in the first year of our operation, we

19:01.531 --> 19:02.812
were focused. We had a fairly broad focus. And 
incidentally,

19:06.029 --> 19:31.034
he was and is

19:06.029 --> 19:31.034
of

19:06.029 --> 19:31.034
the opinion that the state of Texas sort of lurches 
from crisis to crisis without any long-range

19:06.029 --> 19:31.034
planning. And so the center's charter states that 
we will do strategic studies for the state of

19:31.054 --> 19:34.257
Texas, long-range planning studies. An 
incredibly broad charter. Here

19:35.932 --> 19:53.356
again, it's sort

19:35.932 --> 19:53.356
of, and he

19:35.932 --> 19:53.356
gave us some money to get it started, of course. And 
he had his characteristic viewpoint about this.

19:57.281 --> 20:00.706
But he knew we were tackling, we were trying to slay 
a much larger dragon. And here, he said, you have

20:00.726 --> 20:02.108
that thing, self-supporting for 10 years. And 
that's what it would

20:03.421 --> 20:20.187
have taken

20:03.421 --> 20:20.187
to have functioned the way we had originally 
started. And so it was really with that charter

20:20.207 --> 20:30.964
that he took to the Board of Regents in the spring of 
78. I've been a

20:31.754 --> 20:53.668
visiting

20:31.754 --> 20:53.668
professor

20:31.754 --> 20:53.668
over at the American University in Cairo. And we 
didn't even have a name for the damn thing at that

20:53.688 --> 20:56.692
time, at least that we had settled on. And I 
remember when I was still in Cairo, we telexed back

20:56.712 --> 20:58.074
and forth. He had some other name for it. And I 
remember telexing him and telling him that it

20:58.715 --> 21:00.478
ought to be called the Center Force And so that

21:02.551 --> 21:23.752
was the name of it

21:02.551 --> 21:23.752
for

21:02.551 --> 21:23.752
the Board of Regents. But he talked about the input 
we'd had from the Air Force officers in the

21:23.772 --> 21:25.874
national security issues. He told them that it was 
our intention to do classified work. It was our

21:27.135 --> 21:28.356
intention to work with the intelligence 
agencies. Well, can you imagine going to the Board

21:28.376 --> 21:30.519
of Regents of Berkeley, UC Berkeley, with a 
proposal like that? Never in Christ's name. but

21:31.778 --> 21:47.819
with the rich

21:31.778 --> 21:47.819
military

21:31.778 --> 21:47.819
tradition that undergirds Texas A&M. The 
regents,

21:47.839 --> 21:54.147
two of them, said amen and added it. And so we set 
about building yet another new program. And then,

21:55.989 --> 21:56.790
of course, one year into that, Mr.

21:57.580 --> 22:20.325
Benson retired and Dr. Porter

21:57.580 --> 22:20.325
took over. And again, Dr. Porter was never fit in 
long-term pay off. His directive to me was make it

22:21.506 --> 22:22.908
self-supporting as quickly as you can. And so I'll 
give you three years. He didn't say that

22:23.609 --> 22:25.611
specifically, but that was the message that I got. 
Well, The place where there is money is DOD. And so

22:30.866 --> 22:48.076
we focused

22:30.866 --> 22:48.076
our efforts almost totally on DOD. And we were 
self-supporting it for years. Again, starting

22:48.937 --> 22:50.520
from scratch and starting to know credibility. 
And

22:52.492 --> 23:19.021
again,

22:52.492 --> 23:19.021
you know, even though the program took some turns 
that were not originally envisioned, it wouldn't

22:52.492 --> 23:19.021
have happened without T's money. And so now we 
bring in about a million bucks a year. We have about

23:20.102 --> 23:20.883
a million dollars a year. Of that, I get $90,000 
from T's. And the rest of it is hustle.

23:25.769 --> 23:46.680
i think the as of

23:25.769 --> 23:46.680
the

23:25.769 --> 23:46.680
first of august the center will be five years old 
and we've had a fair amount of success but again it

23:25.769 --> 23:46.680
all starts with

23:25.769 --> 23:46.680
teeth The center's focus

23:48.449 --> 23:54.098
has narrowed, right? Because of funding 
problems? Temporarily, yes. But it is my

23:55.981 --> 23:59.627
intention to broaden it as I can. So once you've got 
one area financially solvent, then you can get T's

23:59.647 --> 24:07.980
money to broaden it? Well, I don't know that we can 
get T's money to do that. I did get

24:14.065 --> 24:37.991
a, this next year they will give me $120,000.

24:38.011 --> 24:39.853
And I intend to use that additional $30,000 to 
track them all down. One of my colleagues, Dr.

24:39.873 --> 24:41.455
Bragg, is now interacting with the governor's 
office. And that's a very, very slow process. But

24:42.702 --> 24:57.606
we are trying

24:42.702 --> 24:57.606
to pursue this

24:42.702 --> 24:57.606
responsibility that we have to do some advanced 
planning for the state. We have had a couple little

24:57.626 --> 24:58.327
things. We did an incredible study for the state of 
Texas and see the, when the center was formed, Mr.

24:58.347 --> 25:08.524
Bradley had left the Industrial Economics 
Research Division to take over TEKS. And so that

25:09.348 --> 25:29.307
was brought

25:09.348 --> 25:29.307
into the Center for

25:09.348 --> 25:29.307
Strategic Technology. Again, the thought being 
that that could be the focus for our state efforts.

25:33.151 --> 25:34.892
And if we'd had a little bit more key support, we 
could have made that fly. But the economic

25:34.912 --> 25:36.434
development, industrial development, began to 
dry out then. And so we've lost most of the people

25:36.454 --> 25:37.735
that populated that effort. But

25:39.487 --> 26:07.145
yes, we

25:39.487 --> 26:07.145
will

25:39.487 --> 26:07.145
try to live up to the charter that was originally 
described to the Senate. And I think our defense

26:07.165 --> 26:08.447
program is in relatively good shape now. It's just 
a

26:09.018 --> 26:29.830
question of doing

26:09.018 --> 26:29.830
the

26:09.018 --> 26:29.830
necessary promotion and establishing 
credibility to get involved in these other areas.

26:29.850 --> 26:30.351
And I think we can do it. You talked about 
interdisciplinary work problems. And mostly

26:32.374 --> 26:33.396
you're dealing with engineering before. But in 
this center, you have to go outside of

26:33.416 --> 26:34.638
engineering. Yes. Is that a bigger problem, or

26:35.225 --> 26:50.861
is it pretty much the same as just getting 
engineers to work? Oh, it's basically the same

26:50.881 --> 27:00.411
problem there, but it has a little bit different 
connotation to it, a little bit different

26:50.881 --> 27:00.411
complexion to it, I guess I should say. Yeah, 
you're right. We have

27:03.237 --> 27:30.490
had in the

27:03.237 --> 27:30.490
center, in this center, people

27:03.237 --> 27:30.490
from folks in sociology working for us right now. 
We've had people from history, from business

27:30.510 --> 27:32.653
administration, from architecture, and a few 
from engineering. The problems we encounter

27:34.777 --> 27:57.291
in that are, well, we still have this problem of,

27:34.777 --> 27:57.291
say we have a person from sociology who's going to 
work for us. okay, suppose he or she comes over and

27:57.963 --> 28:11.199
just

27:57.963 --> 28:11.199
does some really outstanding work for us. I can't 
affect their promotion. Their promotion is

28:12.360 --> 28:16.706
handled through the sociology department. So the 
only damn thing I can do, and do do, is to, in the fall

28:16.726 --> 28:27.919
of the year, when tenure and promotion concerns 
are operational,

28:28.152 --> 28:43.430
I write the dean and the department head of the 
appropriate college and give them an accounting

28:28.152 --> 28:43.430
of how that person has performed. And that's the 
most I can do. So I guess that's the most difficult

28:49.357 --> 28:53.982
problem we have. The other problem deals with 
class factors.

29:01.885 --> 29:15.692
And here again, you have to assess the

29:01.885 --> 29:15.692
attitude of the dean and department

29:01.885 --> 29:15.692
head in question. If they want a young man or a young 
woman to publish, then you,

29:15.712 --> 29:22.425
you dastardly get them involved in classified 
work.

29:26.573 --> 29:34.521
So on those, when we encounter that situation, 
we've had a few circumstances.

29:34.722 --> 29:45.613
There's

29:34.722 --> 29:45.613
a man in political

29:34.722 --> 29:45.613
science, whom I will not name, who has been 
interested in our work. But I have had to take him

29:45.633 --> 29:50.218
aside and tell him that getting involved with us 
may be hazardous to your academic health. And of

29:51.312 --> 30:10.072
course

29:51.312 --> 30:10.072
in that case we have a department that is 
controlled not by the dean, not by the department

29:51.312 --> 30:10.072
head, but by a committee of four professors. And 
none of whom are Soviet experts, none of whom give a

30:10.092 --> 30:13.055
flip for Soviet work. And so a young man ain't going 
to ride Soviet work to promotion and tenure in that

30:13.075 --> 30:17.860
department because it has to be approved by the 
four profs. And so he has to be, in effect, a traitor

30:18.481 --> 30:40.817
to his own cause, and go over the hurdles that they 
set up for him, namely, you know, you will do such

30:18.481 --> 30:40.817
and such kind of work, you will publish in this 
journal and that journal, but not in those, and you

30:18.481 --> 30:40.817
won't publish things through the South, which is 
completely unfortunate. And so in that case,

30:40.837 --> 30:46.125
then, what we tend to do, we tend to do two things. We 
will go to

30:46.730 --> 31:11.798
a

30:46.730 --> 31:11.798
tenured full

30:46.730 --> 31:11.798
professor who has all of these things and can tell 
the department head or the dean to go ahead and get

30:46.730 --> 31:11.798
him involved. And we have some of those. Or we'll go 
outside. And if you walk across the hall, across

31:12.779 --> 31:14.461
the office here, you'll meet Dr. Jamie Kidd. He's 
from Kansas State. A historian. Tremendous guy.

31:16.210 --> 31:37.068
He's

31:16.210 --> 31:37.068
an expert

31:16.210 --> 31:37.068
on the Soviet

31:16.210 --> 31:37.068
Navy, an expert on the Soviet military, doing the 
Soviet Navy. Incredible man. And he has, he has, we

31:37.409 --> 31:38.570
have a summer fellows program here. Because many 
of these guys have nine months contracts for

31:38.590 --> 31:42.113
things to do during the summer. And so he is here for 
his second summer. And then we support him and his

31:43.314 --> 31:44.715
graduate students during the year. This

31:45.725 --> 32:02.508
is

31:45.725 --> 32:02.508
with federal money,

31:45.725 --> 32:02.508
not

31:45.725 --> 32:02.508
the T's. And,

32:02.528 --> 32:09.038
oh, we've had Dr. Bill Fuller of the Harvard 
Russian Research Center. Can you imagine Texas

32:09.058 --> 32:10.119
A&M sponsoring work at Harvard? It happens. Dr. 
Bill Zimmerman, the University of Michigan, Dr.

32:10.700 --> 32:12.542
Ivan Volkis, the University of Nebraska. We will 
have two gentlemen from the Air Force Academy with

32:12.563 --> 32:14.365
us this summer for short stays. Oh,

32:15.307 --> 32:23.817
Erickson. Well, I wasn't... He's not 
Summerfellow, but that's another... That's a

32:25.398 --> 32:28.262
special case.

32:33.528 --> 32:40.756
We have to talk

32:33.528 --> 32:40.756
about John. But there's somebody else. I don't 
know their U.S. But in any event,

32:50.221 --> 33:01.555
That's the

32:50.221 --> 33:01.555
general way we've solved that

32:50.221 --> 33:01.555
problem. Now let me pursue this, because it may be 
of interest to whomever is listening to this tape

33:01.575 --> 33:14.351
100

33:01.575 --> 33:14.351
years from now. Doug Porter has suggested that we 
might go hire full-time research people. instead

33:19.837 --> 33:27.325
of using faculty to staff our research teams. And 
he and I have had another rather serious

33:27.345 --> 33:34.612
disagreement over that. And don't

33:34.632 --> 33:44.202
misunderstand. We just have different points of 
view here. We're not the wild-eyed enemies of one

33:45.103 --> 33:46.044
another. I think we have a great deal of respect for 
one another. But I have trouble with that.

33:48.963 --> 34:09.387
Because, you

33:48.963 --> 34:09.387
know, my view is

33:48.963 --> 34:09.387
if you're going to have full-time research 
people, then why the hell not have a Southwest

33:48.963 --> 34:09.387
Research Institute or a Battelle or whatever? Or 
putting it the other way, my view is that anybody

34:09.407 --> 34:17.316
that our principal job at this institution is 
teaching still, and you can talk about the

34:09.407 --> 34:17.316
research program and you can talk about 
influencing national decision-making

34:09.407 --> 34:17.316
processes, but all of that ought to impact

34:17.684 --> 34:29.616
the teaching and educational process, the 
intellectual development of the young people,

34:17.684 --> 34:29.616
because that's why we're here, first and 
fundamentally. And so, having a bunch of people

34:29.636 --> 34:40.887
that never see a student, never go into a 
classroom, I don't dig that at all. I have great

34:40.907 --> 34:47.514
philosophical

34:40.907 --> 34:47.514
difficulty with that. But it if we can't solve some 
of these other problems, if I can't get my hands on

34:47.992 --> 34:59.805
the

34:47.992 --> 34:59.805
faculty that I need, then what am I to do? I guess I 
can either say, well, you know, we will attenuate

34:59.885 --> 35:12.579
the growth of the center to fit whatever we can draw 
on, or we can go out and have the answer.

35:17.645 --> 35:17.965
Well,

35:20.797 --> 35:41.903
He and I

35:20.797 --> 35:41.903
had

35:20.797 --> 35:41.903
a rather serious discussion about that about six 
months ago, and I was ready to submit my

35:20.797 --> 35:41.903
resignation letter, because it was just 
philosophically not acceptable to me. But we came

35:41.923 --> 35:45.387
to an accommodation, and what we agreed was that as 
long as 50% of the program would somehow impact

35:46.312 --> 36:01.209
the teaching function.

36:01.229 --> 36:01.329
Fine. When it gets to be 51%, that's when I leave. So 
that's the interdisciplinary problem is a

36:05.154 --> 36:10.140
far-reaching one. It has a lot of impact,

36:10.160 --> 36:14.665
as you can see from this discussion.

36:17.615 --> 36:22.940
And I don't know how to solve it. Because certainly 
other colleges, other departments

36:22.960 --> 36:33.591
have different views. And of course, there are 
those who think that the center is a wrong

36:33.611 --> 36:39.817
operation. In other words, they will say, as soon 
as you take money from DOD, you're sold. And I say,

36:48.057 --> 36:51.943
your ass is bought. That you're dancing to their

36:51.963 --> 36:56.590
tune. Well, I suppose

36:56.610 --> 37:08.609
with some that may be true, but there's no proof 
here. And now it's true the DOD will tell us, they

37:08.629 --> 37:13.156
will give us the money to do a specific piece of 
research. I mean, they will give you. Well,

37:13.797 --> 37:16.461
incredible as it may seem, I have got the little 
chunk of money And

37:17.977 --> 37:34.258
the guy said,

37:17.977 --> 37:34.258
and I asked him, I said, what do you want to do with 
it? He said, anything you want to, which is a

37:34.278 --> 37:36.301
reference. But that's not strictly true. It has to 
be related to space. Within the space of anything

37:40.566 --> 37:41.427
that you want. But most of it, most of it, all the 
rest of the money that we can have is specifically

37:41.447 --> 37:43.410
the record. So they do specify the topics

37:44.268 --> 38:01.175
that we study,

37:44.268 --> 38:01.175
but they don't specify the way we do our research. 
And above

38:01.195 --> 38:10.570
all, they don't specify the results of the 
research. And I don't have any problem with that. I

38:11.391 --> 38:12.132
don't think it restricts us at all. So, but clearly 
if, and already because of the success we've

38:13.073 --> 38:33.632
had, Dr. Porter has asked me,

38:13.073 --> 38:33.632
how big is the center going to get? How big do you 
want to be? Because I think he perceives that we

38:35.173 --> 38:38.476
could probably be almost as big as we wanted to be. 
And that's a good question. I don't know. My answer

38:39.337 --> 38:40.498
to him was a kind of a pat answer. an evasive

38:41.086 --> 39:01.332
answer because I said to him that I want to be as big 
as we have to be to meet our

38:41.086 --> 39:01.332
service needs to Texas A&M. And I don't really know 
what that is. I don't know how many faculty might

39:02.113 --> 39:03.415
want to get involved with us. When it comes to

39:04.036 --> 39:27.392
influence international

39:04.036 --> 39:27.392
decision-making processes, I do want to insert 
Texas A&M into that process, into that whole

39:04.036 --> 39:27.392
business. I want to see more Texas A&M faculty 
testifying before Congress. When I was at

39:28.995 --> 39:29.816
Maryland, it just irked me. It still irks me to go to 
Washington and when Congress needs expertise,

39:29.836 --> 39:32.440
and all we bring, most

39:32.723 --> 39:50.850
of

39:32.723 --> 39:50.850
the time

39:32.723 --> 39:50.850
will be some guy from MIT or Stanford. And that just 
gripes me badly. And there are times when a

39:51.491 --> 39:54.536
southwestern viewpoint on certain national 
issues needs to be inserted. And that's not to say

39:54.556 --> 39:59.202
that we've got all the right answers or anything. 
But you know, we've

40:05.410 --> 40:28.261
You know,

40:05.410 --> 40:28.261
back

40:05.410 --> 40:28.261
in 20

40:05.410 --> 40:28.261
years ago, we had guys like Lyndon Johnson and John 
Conway and Olden Teague and many others who

40:05.410 --> 40:28.261
represented this area. Now, I wouldn't, you know, 
I wouldn't want to say that I supported those guys

40:28.281 --> 40:32.086
in everything they did or said, because I didn't. 
On the other hand, represented

40:34.030 --> 40:53.327
the

40:34.030 --> 40:53.327
area

40:34.030 --> 40:53.327
well.

40:53.347 --> 40:56.029
They inserted regional viewpoints into the 
national decision-making processes. And now

40:56.049 --> 40:58.111
they're gone. And we're calling this down now, of 
course, but I mean, he's not influential anymore

40:58.131 --> 41:00.693
in a national sense. And I think to some extent, we 
can't We can't fill those shoes. But to some

41:07.580 --> 41:10.604
extent, we ought to try. I think one of the things we 
can do is to represent the people of the state of

41:11.845 --> 41:22.497
Texas in some of these matters. And so I

41:23.098 --> 41:33.670
want us to pursue that as aggressively as we can. 
I've testified before Congress, but it's been a

41:34.477 --> 41:50.021
situation

41:34.477 --> 41:50.021
where I'm sitting here and the phone rang and a 
friend of mine in Washington who knew that I had

41:34.477 --> 41:50.021
certain kinds of expertise would say, hey, Dick, 
would you like to offer some testimony? Well,

41:50.041 --> 41:52.846
that's a passive system. And Aggies ain't 
passive. We're active. And so what I would like to

41:56.431 --> 42:02.661
do is to have a situation where we could understand 
what was going on

42:02.894 --> 42:30.380
in Congress and the issues that they were going to 
be confronting when a certain

42:02.894 --> 42:30.380
area came up in which we had expertise within the 
college or within the university that we could put

42:02.894 --> 42:30.380
a guy on an airplane and get him up there before 
Congress and that we could do research and do

42:02.894 --> 42:30.380
studies that would influence some of the national 
security agencies. Well, I don't know how big

42:30.400 --> 42:32.142
we're going to grow. That clearly, one way or 
another, we are going to have to solve that problem

42:33.168 --> 42:42.359
of doing interdisciplinary work. Because there 
aren't any of these issues that are narrowly

42:42.379 --> 42:49.408
focused. They almost always

42:49.428 --> 42:57.657
involve a breadth of disciplines. So sometimes 
we've got to solve that problem. What

43:01.619 --> 43:06.906
about Erickson? Well, of

43:07.126 --> 43:19.944
course,

43:07.126 --> 43:19.944
Erickson deserves a lot of credit for the success 
that the cinema has had. I first met John in 1971,

43:19.964 --> 43:26.773
just about the time that the cinema was formed. And 
I don't know how much you know about John Erickson.

43:30.863 --> 43:36.751
Oh, I know a little to the history part. Yeah, 
hopefully. Well, he's, if you listed the top five

43:39.034 --> 43:55.517
or six Western criminologists

43:39.034 --> 43:55.517
or experts on the Soviet military, he would have to 
be among them. He's brilliant. A genius by any

43:55.858 --> 43:56.379
standard. Speaks six languages fully. as

43:59.855 --> 44:06.043
a photographic memory. Couldn't find his way 
through the DFW airport, unaided, if his life

44:06.104 --> 44:18.621
depended on it, you know. He's a thorough-going

44:18.641 --> 44:24.789
academician, and just one public man. The 
relationship with Erickson began, really, it had

44:24.809 --> 44:29.035
its roots in the productivity program, if you 
believe. I had been

44:29.892 --> 44:54.125
appointed

44:29.892 --> 44:54.125
to

44:29.892 --> 44:54.125
this Air Force Oversight Committee to look over 
the I can't program. And a young Air Force captain

44:54.145 --> 44:57.190
who was involved in that program lived next door to 
a guy who was on our staff here, but he was on me. And

44:57.210 --> 44:59.713
Lynn had been selected as an Air Force research 
associate and had spent a year with John over in

45:00.048 --> 45:09.841
England. And so through this Air Force captain, I 
got Lynn's name, and he was in the Pentagon at that

45:09.861 --> 45:21.335
time and stopped by to see him. And that led to 
John's visiting Texas Airmen. And then an

45:27.217 --> 45:38.451
interesting

45:27.217 --> 45:38.451
incident happened. It's just, you know, you look 
at these things, Gary, you have to, you have to

45:38.471 --> 45:47.022
conclude that somebody upstairs is looking out 
for you. It's incredible how these things happen.

45:47.863 --> 45:50.406
Uh, John has enjoyed support from the Pentagon for 
many years because of his incredible

45:47.863 --> 45:50.406
understanding of the circle. And, but of course 
the Pentagon cannot give money directly to a

45:52.090 --> 45:59.402
foreign institution. And so it has to be 
laundered. It has to be channeled through another

46:02.246 --> 46:07.394
organization. And one of the, at that time the 
organization was one of the,
