WEBVTT

00:01.290 --> 00:14.050
The innovation

00:01.290 --> 00:14.050
program, they had a thing called the TIG, 
Technology Innovation Group, and the thrust of

00:14.030 --> 00:21.460
this was to try to develop new technologies, and as 
it turned out, this focused largely on computer

00:21.440 --> 00:23.340
technology.

00:33.170 --> 00:40.690
And we had, I don't know how many cities we 
eventually worked with. I think it was something

00:40.750 --> 00:45.690
between 50 and 60 cities in the state of Texas. In 
addition to that, we had, through the NSF program,

00:45.670 --> 00:53.280
we became the backup agency to help Little Rock, 
Arkansas,

00:53.260 --> 01:08.890
and

00:53.260 --> 01:08.890
it was a tremendously successful program. And 
then in the, what, about 76, I guess it was, then we

01:09.870 --> 01:18.970
hired Don Moore, who replaced me as the director of 
the center. Of course, it went on up until... The

01:26.070 --> 01:36.620
early 80s, the federal funding report 
disappeared,

01:26.070 --> 01:36.620
things went downhill pretty rapidly. It was a 
separate center at that time, and I had nothing to

01:37.300 --> 01:42.920
do with it. I

01:43.140 --> 01:57.030
had to

01:43.140 --> 01:57.030
dry it up, and NSF supported dry it. And I guess, to 
me, one of the saddest elements of that whole thing

01:57.190 --> 02:09.720
was that the cities,

01:57.190 --> 02:09.720
I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised at 
that, but I was.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.120
We had, over the decade, in the 70s... It was the 
last half of it, and we had developed, I thought,

02:18.840 --> 02:28.300
excellent rapport with the cities. You know, 
they're very applied in their concerns, and you

02:28.280 --> 02:38.000
have to be careful about the words that you use in 
working with them. For example, we learned rather

02:39.980 --> 02:46.120
quickly, you don't say research, because when you 
say research, a city councilman in Abilene or

02:46.100 --> 02:52.340
whatever will conjure up some guy in a white coat 
surrounded by testicles. And they're not always

02:55.003 --> 02:57.060
going to find one. So we called

02:57.040 --> 03:01.360
it property solving. But in spite of that, and in 
spite of the fact that we had done, I thought, a hell

03:01.340 --> 03:05.360
of a lot of good things for the cities, Don Moore, 
and I was never a more able guy, would draw any

03:11.900 --> 03:18.850
support from the Texas cities to continue that. 
And when Dr. Porter took over TEAS,

03:18.830 --> 03:30.860
his edict was, if it can't be self-supporting, I'm 
not in

03:30.840 --> 03:38.550
the wrong view, frankly, but because this still is 
a land grant. I went to college. I

03:41.590 --> 03:51.880
think we still have. I went to him when the center 
was essentially giving, the program operation

03:51.860 --> 03:55.880
was essentially giving back to me with a 
recommendation that put some TEAS money into it to

03:55.860 --> 04:03.880
keep it going, because I thought that the federal 
funding would eventually swing, the pendulum

04:03.860 --> 04:08.880
would swing back the other way, and there would be 
money coming. I've seen these oscillations

04:13.860 --> 04:18.820
within the federal establishment before, and I 
thought it would be a good idea to do it again. But

04:22.340 --> 04:26.980
Skip wasn't interested in that. And with his 
background, I mean. So it, although it still

04:31.130 --> 04:48.470
exists on paper, and we still do thrust, but as

04:31.130 --> 04:48.470
you're aware, there is now a new center for affairs 
set up, which incidentally draws on some of the

04:54.450 --> 04:59.470
faculty that were involved with us in the Old Urban 
Program Center. And that's great. I think that

05:02.360 --> 05:04.950
will, it's nice to have that. The problem it will 
have is that there is no TEAS involved, so they

05:04.930 --> 05:10.950
don't have that money.

05:19.009 --> 05:27.930
So

05:19.009 --> 05:27.930
they're going to be scraping along with, and of 
course some of the liberal arts faculty and others

05:27.910 --> 05:33.930
are empowered to use some of their academic time 
for research. Professors

05:33.910 --> 05:50.680
are given release time from their teaching chores 
to do research. And so they can do, you know, so

05:50.660 --> 05:55.560
there are some guys in liberal arts that want to do 
that work with the cities.

05:59.540 --> 06:03.050
So in any event, that was too much detail, I'm sure, 
on the Center for. You hadn't really gotten enough

06:03.030 --> 06:04.051
on that. It was a fascinating time. Fascinating 
experience. The Center for Strategic

06:05.948 --> 06:07.050
Technology. How did that come about? Oh my land. 
How many more TEAS did you have? How much time did

06:10.030 --> 06:11.051
you have? We've

06:11.030 --> 06:15.980
got another hour. We've got another hour. We've 
got another hour. We've got another hour. We've

06:19.620 --> 06:22.010
got another hour. We've got another hour. We've 
got another hour. We've got another hour. We've

06:26.390 --> 06:27.820
got another hour. We've got another hour. We've 
got another hour. Hours were a thing. You want the

06:30.800 --> 06:31.821
full story on that? Well. Is this your idea? I'm 
sorry? Is this your idea? Oh yeah. Again, coupled

06:36.964 --> 06:39.880
with Mr. Benson. I

06:39.860 --> 06:56.130
guess the original idea sprang

06:39.860 --> 06:56.130
from some things that didn't fit into the original 
idea. That's right. That's

06:58.170 --> 07:02.156
right. The original idea is that you are not going

07:02.196 --> 07:17.800
to save the city. That's

07:17.780 --> 07:21.592
right. You're going to save the city. In fact, 
you're going to save the city. that began to occur

07:23.560 --> 07:30.060
in the mid-'70s, as I think the first time we 
started even verbalizing, he

07:30.040 --> 07:38.930
and I, notions that gradually, over a period of 
time, shaped themselves into what is now the

07:42.910 --> 07:45.930
Senate. I guess that was probably late-'74 and 
mid-'75. And the thrust of it was the following. It

07:56.790 --> 08:01.840
was clear that Texas A&M aspired to greatness. It 
wants to be a great university. And it was also

08:04.160 --> 08:09.450
clear that, as I've already said, back in the 50s it 
was a great educational institution, but it was a

08:13.430 --> 08:21.870
kind of insular sort of...

08:21.850 --> 08:26.870
It had very limited viewpoints, very limited 
outlook and outreach. And, of course, as the

08:26.850 --> 08:29.870
research program was started by Mr. Rutherford, 
and Mr. Benson had flowered, and, of course, that

08:33.850 --> 08:38.430
outreach effort expanded, and our worldly 
awareness, if you will, expanded. And there was

08:43.810 --> 08:47.830
also a realization that every greatness, again,

08:47.810 --> 08:59.430
if you look at it, what makes them great? Well, as 
we've already said, it's not their academics.

09:02.410 --> 09:04.430
It's part of the whole, yeah. The research

09:04.410 --> 09:14.490
program, yeah. But more than that, they apply 
their expertise to

09:17.100 --> 09:23.880
solve problems that are sort of like the old RAIN 
program, problems that are associated with

09:26.860 --> 09:31.440
national needs. And

09:31.420 --> 09:45.240
it also helps to have people appointed to high 
places. So you see Henry Kissinger come in the

09:45.220 --> 09:48.240
compartment, and

09:48.220 --> 10:00.130
that helps

09:48.220 --> 10:00.130
the image of greatness. And what this all boiled 
down to was that we wanted tribes to try to insert

10:05.610 --> 10:12.630
Texas A&M more into national and international 
affairs, more into attacking the great problems

10:14.610 --> 10:19.630
of our time, if you will. And it was just felt that in 
addition to having a damn good academic program,

10:28.550 --> 10:30.570
undergraduate and graduate, in addition to 
having a damn good research program, we wanted to,

10:36.550 --> 10:40.570
we wanted to insert ourselves into some of the 
national decision-making processes. And

10:43.550 --> 10:51.410
I remember writing Mr. Benson a memo back

10:51.390 --> 10:55.110
in, I think, 75, where I told him I was concerned 
about Texas A&M's image as, I think my words were, a

11:03.090 --> 11:08.280
football, military-oriented Cal College. An 
image that, to some extent, was deserved, but to a

11:10.260 --> 11:14.660
large extent was not deserved. And that I thought 
we needed to have a, I just called it a special

11:17.640 --> 11:23.760
research

11:17.640 --> 11:23.760
program, to be aimed at dispelling that image and 
creating a new image. And so I told him I had some

11:27.740 --> 11:32.190
notions I had about how to proceed with this. And so 
he,

11:34.420 --> 11:43.320
as I surveyed the faculty that was appropriate to 
it, and this has to be guys, I mean these have to be

11:47.380 --> 11:48.401
faculty members who have national

11:48.380 --> 11:55.880
or international reputation, people that were 
sort of like E.F. Hutton, you know, when they

11:57.860 --> 11:58.881
taught folks, listen,

11:58.860 --> 12:06.870
within the College of Engineering, I could count 
them again on the fingers of one finger. And so I

12:10.850 --> 12:15.300
told him that I thought we ought to get some money 
from our affluent graduates, Mr. Sackler and

12:19.280 --> 12:20.301
others, we

12:20.280 --> 12:28.310
always knew Mr. Sackler. And I thought we ought to 
get a little bundle of cash, well, maybe not such a

12:31.290 --> 12:34.130
little bundle, but we ought to go by the people that 
had it. And

12:37.490 --> 12:43.020
it doesn't take any, you know, you need some sort of 
critical mass, I mean, one guy's not going to get

12:45.700 --> 12:49.510
three or four, again, if you, if they were working 
in complementary areas, you

12:54.490 --> 12:59.890
couldn't have a guy who was, to some extent, you 
know, and,

13:00.870 --> 13:05.020
well, in any event, that was the thrust of that, and 
he thought that was great. And so he marched

13:11.810 --> 13:13.830
promptly over to the Dr. Williams office, laid it 
on him, and Dr. Williams thought it was great, but

13:18.600 --> 13:20.860
he said, it needs to be focused. Well, over the 
next, next few weeks and months, he focused it. And

13:31.500 --> 13:32.521
it now exists as the Center for Free Enterprise 
Research. And

13:36.500 --> 13:41.110
I'll never forget the day that that decision was 
made that it was going to be given to economics.

13:46.140 --> 13:49.080
Benson came into my office and with 
characteristic full head esteem knowing

13:52.400 --> 13:58.600
he was, and kind of as a sop, why,

13:59.580 --> 14:04.790
Benson, on

14:04.770 --> 14:09.790
the board. And don't misunderstand. We couldn't 
fault, and do not fault, the thrust of that center.

14:15.950 --> 14:19.970
It is, it is a very worthwhile thing to do. It is a job 
that needs to be done. It

14:23.350 --> 14:30.840
should be pursued. But

14:30.820 --> 14:41.510
nonetheless,

14:30.820 --> 14:41.510
operations sort of missed the target that we, and 
so during, that was set up about, what, 76, I think,

14:49.970 --> 14:50.991
or maybe 77, I can't remember. But over that next 
year, I can remember Mr. Benson would go to these

14:56.240 --> 14:58.260
meetings of that board of advisors and he would 
come back boiling every, because again, you know,

15:09.100 --> 15:11.120
it was sort of our idea that had been perverted. 
And,

15:13.100 --> 15:18.640
and so by, by 1977 then, he and I had agreed that we 
were going to make another run. Of course, the

15:26.800 --> 15:30.000
administration at that time, and, and Dr. 
Williams was out of the scene, out of the picture,

15:34.420 --> 15:44.310
and everything would have been

15:34.420 --> 15:44.310
taken over. And then some other, some other 
interesting things began to happen in 77. We had,

15:50.590 --> 15:54.610
we had begun to talk with various government 
people about this idea,

16:03.100 --> 16:05.120
trying to get them to help us shape the thing. So, we 
were visited in 77 by some fairly high-ranking

16:13.350 --> 16:19.890
Air Force men. They said that, you know, we need, I

16:23.870 --> 16:34.900
mean, to do several things. But the reason we need a 
new one is that most of the existing think tanks

16:39.970 --> 16:43.680
have become too institutionalized, or as they put 
it, one Air Force officer said, they have become so

16:48.820 --> 16:51.840
much a part of the Washington scene that they have 
begun to feed on one. We need a

16:54.030 --> 17:01.160
think tank that will do Soviet

17:01.140 --> 17:06.830
stuff. A lot of our Soviet, existing Soviet 
studies are too much based on the mirror image

17:10.810 --> 17:15.070
syndrome. And what that means is that a 
philosophical viewpoint which looks at the

17:19.300 --> 17:22.320
Soviets as mirror images of us, that, you know, 
fundamentally they're just like us. They, they

17:27.320 --> 17:29.340
think like us. They want the same things in the 
world as we do. They respond to pressures in the

17:32.540 --> 17:34.560
world as

17:34.540 --> 17:39.930
we do that. But it did,

17:50.150 --> 17:53.000
you know, take the graduate market. And so I've 
seen the mirror image syndrome in action now. I

17:55.980 --> 17:58.210
mean, it was exactly right. That's, because I 
remember thinking that myself when I was young

18:01.660 --> 18:02.681
again. And

18:02.660 --> 18:09.130
so, they then suggested that, that this new 
center, that we, still somewhat ill-formed in our

18:11.110 --> 18:15.880
mind, ought to have a very definite national 
security. And

18:18.860 --> 18:26.210
so

18:18.860 --> 18:26.210
that, that was reflected in the way the center was 
finally shaped. But, if you look at our charter,

18:32.470 --> 18:37.210
you will find that we are empowered in

18:37.190 --> 18:46.040
the urban system. Mr. Benson, bless his heart,

18:54.700 --> 18:56.720
and indeed, in the first year of our, and,

18:56.700 --> 19:07.580
and

18:56.700 --> 19:07.580
incidentally, he was, was and is, of the opinion 
that the state of Texas sort of lurches from crisis

19:12.560 --> 19:15.920
to crisis without any long-range police. The 
center's charter, an

19:21.040 --> 19:34.570
incredibly

19:21.040 --> 19:34.570
broad charter, here again, it's sort of a, and he 
gave us some money to get it started. And,

19:39.020 --> 19:50.170
he

19:39.020 --> 19:50.170
had his characteristic viewpoint about this. 
But, he knew we were tackling, we were trying to

19:52.150 --> 19:56.350
slay a much larger dragon. And here, he

19:56.330 --> 20:17.600
said,

20:17.580 --> 20:19.600
so, it was really with that, with that, charter, 
that he took to the, to the Board of Regents in, in

20:28.360 --> 20:32.160
the spring of 78. I was, I'd been a, a visiting 
professor over at the American University in

20:35.140 --> 20:37.160
Cairo. And we didn't even have a name for the damn 
thing. But, and I remember when I was still in

20:39.780 --> 20:43.650
Cairo, he,

20:43.630 --> 20:48.280
we telexed back and forth. He had some other name 
for it. And, and I remember telexing, telexing and

20:54.020 --> 20:56.040
telling him that, that it ought to be called the 
Center Force. And so that was the name it went for.

21:04.100 --> 21:09.420
But he, he talked about the input we'd had from the 
Air Force officers and the national security

21:10.400 --> 21:12.420
issues. He told them that it was our intention to do 
classified work. It was our intention to work with

21:16.400 --> 21:18.420
the intelligence agencies. Well,

21:18.400 --> 21:23.790
can you imagine going to the Board of Regents of 
Berkeley and UC Berkeley with a proposal like

21:25.770 --> 21:27.790
that? Never in Christ's name. But with the rich 
military tradition in other words, Texas A&M. The

21:34.330 --> 21:34.840
Regents, two of them, said, Amen and Avenue. And 
so, set about building yet another new program.

21:43.150 --> 21:46.600
Then, Mr. Benson retired. And, and, and, and, and,

21:52.720 --> 21:59.630
and, and,

21:59.610 --> 22:13.520
and,

22:13.500 --> 22:20.979
and

22:13.500 --> 22:20.979
retired. To me, to me, was maybe self-supporting. 
He didn't say that specifically, but that's the

22:24.910 --> 22:26.600
message. Well, ah, um, the place where there is 
money is

22:31.690 --> 22:41.171
DOD. And so,

22:49.610 --> 22:53.440
ah,

22:49.610 --> 22:53.440
scrap! It

22:53.420 --> 22:58.880
starts with no credibility. And, and again, you 
know, the end to the end vision couldn't have

23:06.340 --> 23:07.361
happened without ties minimum. And, so now we, we 
bring in about a million bucks a year. Ah, we have I

23:15.430 --> 23:39.041
think the,

23:15.430 --> 23:39.041
as of the 1st of August, the center will be five 
years old and a fair amount

23:15.430 --> 23:39.041
of success. But again, it all starts with teeth.

23:45.950 --> 23:52.182
Now, the center's focus has narrowed, right? 
Because of funding problems? Temporarily, yes.

23:55.322 --> 23:58.830
But it is my intention to broaden it as I can. So once 
you've got one area financially solvent, you can

23:58.810 --> 24:06.830
get T's money to broaden it? Well, I don't know that 
we can get T's money to broaden it. I did get, this

24:14.881 --> 24:35.230
next year they will give me $100.1010

24:14.881 --> 24:35.230
to

24:14.881 --> 24:35.230
use that is now interacting with the governor's 
office. That's

24:35.210 --> 24:43.504
a very, very slow process. I'm going to pursue 
this. We have

24:44.890 --> 24:51.090
had a couple little things. And see,

24:51.070 --> 24:59.580
when the center was formed, Mr. Bradley had left 
the industrial economics research division to

24:59.560 --> 25:07.420
take over T's. And so that was brought in to the 
center. Again, the thought being that that could

25:12.740 --> 25:28.690
be the focus of

25:12.740 --> 25:28.690
the economic

25:12.740 --> 25:28.690
development, industrial development. But yes,

25:28.670 --> 25:54.000
we will try to

25:28.670 --> 25:54.000
live

25:28.670 --> 25:54.000
up to the charter. I think our defense program is in 
relatively good shape. It's

26:04.410 --> 26:14.730
just a question of establishment. It's a question 
of establishing credibility to get involved in

26:14.710 --> 26:18.820
these other areas. You

26:18.800 --> 26:27.050
talk about interdisciplinary. Again, mostly 
you're dealing with engineering. But in this

26:30.030 --> 26:35.050
center, you have to go outside of engineering as 
well. Is that a bigger problem, or is it pretty much

26:35.030 --> 26:41.050
the same as just getting engineers to vote? It's

26:41.030 --> 26:53.630
basically the same problem there, but it has a 
little bit different content. Yeah, you're

26:53.610 --> 27:00.880
right.

27:00.860 --> 27:07.190
We have had in the center, in this center of people, 
the

27:07.170 --> 27:48.440
problems we encounter

27:07.170 --> 27:48.440
in that are,

27:07.170 --> 27:48.440
we still have this problem of, say

27:48.420 --> 28:04.840
we have a, he or

27:48.420 --> 28:04.840
she comes over and just does some really 
outstanding work for us. Our

28:04.820 --> 28:14.940
promotion

28:04.820 --> 28:14.940
is handled through the sociology department. So 
the only damn thing I can do, do-do, is to when, in

28:14.920 --> 28:22.570
the fall of the year, when tenure and promotion 
concerns are operational,

28:31.060 --> 28:43.520
I write the dean and the department

28:31.060 --> 28:43.520
head and give them an accounting of how that person 
has performed. And that's the most I can do.

28:49.300 --> 28:52.320
So I guess that's the most difficult problem we 
have. The other problem deals with classifying.

29:02.180 --> 29:06.200
Here again, you have to assess the attitude of the 
dean and department head. If they want, then you,

29:06.180 --> 29:26.890
you'd ask them to get them involved

29:06.180 --> 29:26.890
in

29:06.180 --> 29:26.890
classifying. So on those, when we encounter that 
situation, we've had a few circumstances,

29:31.870 --> 29:49.810
political

29:31.870 --> 29:49.810
science,

29:31.870 --> 29:49.810
whom I will not, getting involved with us may be 
hazardous to your academic health. Of course, in

29:49.790 --> 29:55.470
that case, we have a department that is controlled 
not by the dean, none of whom are Soviet experts,

29:55.450 --> 30:05.560
none of whom give a flip for Soviet work. And so a 
young man ain't gonna write Soviet work to

30:06.540 --> 30:19.480
promotion intent.

30:19.460 --> 30:22.480
And so he has to be, in effect, a traitor to his own 
cause, and over the hurdles that they set up for

30:22.460 --> 30:27.150
him, namely, you know, you will do such and such 
kind of work, you will publish in this journal and

30:27.130 --> 30:40.530
that journal,

30:27.130 --> 30:40.530
but not in... So in that case, then, go to a tenured 
full professor

30:40.510 --> 30:53.840
who has all of these things, and,

30:53.820 --> 31:12.440
and we have some of those,

30:53.820 --> 31:12.440
especially

30:53.820 --> 31:12.440
in Kansas State. He's

31:12.420 --> 31:29.980
a tremendous

31:12.420 --> 31:29.980
guy, because he has, we have a summer fellow in this 
program, because many of these guys have nine

31:29.960 --> 31:34.120
months. And

31:34.100 --> 31:41.760
so he is here for his second summer. And then we 
support him in the Christian

31:41.740 --> 31:57.320
Research Center,

31:57.300 --> 32:01.830
and then sponsoring work at Harvard, if it 
happens. Dr. Bill Zimmerman, the University of

32:01.810 --> 32:19.860
Michigan, Dr.

32:01.810 --> 32:19.860
Lee Bunton. He's the one that's in Scotland. I'm 
sorry, oh, Erickson. Well, I wasn't, yeah,

32:23.840 --> 32:25.860
that's... He's a summer fellow, but that's... 
That's a special case. But

32:28.840 --> 32:57.560
in any event,

32:28.840 --> 32:57.560
that's,

32:28.840 --> 32:57.560
that's the general way we've solved that problem. 
Now

32:57.540 --> 33:05.400
let me, let me pursue this, because it may be of 
interest to whomever the list

33:05.380 --> 33:19.860
has suggested that we might go hire full-time 
research people, instead of using faculty to

33:19.840 --> 33:26.930
staff our research teams. And he and I have had 
another rather serious disagreement, over that,

33:30.910 --> 33:47.040
and don't

33:30.910 --> 33:47.040
misunderstand. But I have trouble with that, 
because, you know, my view is, if we're going to

33:51.160 --> 34:00.410
have, then why the hell not have a Southwest 
Research Institute?

34:00.390 --> 34:03.410
Or putting it the other way, my view is that 
anybody, that our principal job as an institution

34:03.390 --> 34:08.440
is to, and you can talk about the research program, 
and you can influence international

34:10.420 --> 34:14.300
decision-making processes, but all of that.

34:29.390 --> 34:33.410
And so having a bunch of people that never see a 
student, never go into a classroom, I, I don't do

34:35.830 --> 34:46.930
that in a great philosophical

34:35.830 --> 34:46.930
way. But if, if we can't solve some of these other 
problems, if I can't get my hands on the faculty,

34:54.910 --> 34:59.100
then what am I to do? I guess I can either say, well, 
we'll just, you know, we will attenuate the growth

35:02.080 --> 35:06.660
of the center, or we could fit whatever we can draw 
on, we can

35:12.000 --> 35:21.120
draw on half

35:12.000 --> 35:21.120
of it. He, he and I had a rather serious discussion 
about that, about six months ago. And I was ready to

35:25.570 --> 35:31.280
submit my resignation letter, because I just, it 
was just philosophically not acceptable to me.

35:36.370 --> 35:44.960
But, but we came to an accommodation that

35:36.370 --> 35:44.960
as long as 50% of the program somehow

35:44.940 --> 35:49.680
impacted the teacher. So that's,

35:49.660 --> 36:08.600
the interdisciplinary

35:49.660 --> 36:08.600
problem is a far-reaching one. It has a lot of 
impact, as you can see from this discussion. And I

36:12.640 --> 36:20.290
don't know,

36:12.640 --> 36:20.290
I don't know how to solve it. Because certainly, 
because certainly other colleges, other

36:20.270 --> 36:27.690
departments have different views. Of

36:27.670 --> 36:34.200
course, there are those who think, you know, there 
are those who think that the center is a wrong

36:34.180 --> 36:40.330
operation. In other words, they will say, as soon 
as you take money from DOD, your soul, and I say your

36:45.460 --> 36:50.240
ass, is bought. That you're dancing to their tune. 
Well, I suppose with some

36:56.050 --> 37:03.080
that may be true. Now, it's true that

37:03.060 --> 37:10.720
DOD will, a specific piece of research, they will 
give you, well, as incredible

37:12.700 --> 37:26.530
as it may seem, I have got the literature. That's 
not strictly true. It has to be related to space

37:27.510 --> 37:29.530
things, within the space

37:29.510 --> 37:36.190
arena. Most of it.

37:44.420 --> 37:47.440
So they do specify the topics that we study. And I, I 
don't have

37:47.420 --> 38:01.880
any

37:47.420 --> 38:01.880
problem. So,

38:01.860 --> 38:15.200
but clearly if, and already because of this 
testimony, I have never been again. How big do you

38:25.080 --> 38:27.190
want to be? Because I think he perceives that we 
could probably be almost as big as we wanted to be.

38:32.170 --> 38:36.710
And

38:32.170 --> 38:36.710
that's a good question. I don't know. My answer to 
him was a kind of a pat answer. An evasive answer

38:40.690 --> 38:44.710
because I said to him that I want to be as big as we 
have to be to meet our service needs to Texas A&M.

38:54.810 --> 38:57.490
And I don't really know about that. There's

38:57.470 --> 39:06.580
no decision making. I want to see more Texas A&M 
faculty testifying before it comes in Maryland.

39:20.980 --> 39:24.790
It still works in Washington. And when Congress, 
Congress needs expertise. And

39:31.390 --> 39:48.910
there are

39:31.390 --> 39:48.910
times when a southwestern viewpoint on certain

39:48.890 --> 39:54.610
national, and

39:54.590 --> 39:59.450
that's not to say that we've got all the right 
answers. But you know we've, we've, you

40:00.430 --> 40:08.250
know back in 20 years ago, we had guys like Lyndon 
Johnson and John Connery and many others

40:12.830 --> 40:22.140
represented this area. Now I wouldn't, I wouldn't 
want to say that I, supported those guys in

40:26.180 --> 40:30.200
everything they did or said. Because they did it. 
On the other hand, there are things in the area they

40:37.350 --> 40:47.760
inserted points

40:37.350 --> 40:47.760
into the national. And now they're gone. They're

40:48.740 --> 40:53.300
still around of course, but it's not influential 
anymore. And,

40:56.660 --> 41:02.910
and I think to some extent, you know we can't, we 
can't fill those shoes. But to some extent, we

41:08.890 --> 41:11.760
ought to try. I think one of the things we can do is to 
represent the state, the people of the state of

41:14.740 --> 41:17.970
Texas in some of these matters.

41:23.070 --> 41:30.120
So,

41:23.070 --> 41:30.120
I want us to pursue them as aggressively as we can. 
You know I've testified before Congress, but it's

41:36.580 --> 41:38.600
been a situation where I was sitting here and a 
friend of mine in Washington who knew that I had

41:40.580 --> 41:46.920
certain kinds of offers of testimony. Yeah. Well, 
that's a passive system. And Aggies ain't

41:52.480 --> 41:54.500
passive. We're active. And so what I would like to 
do is to have a situation where we could understand

42:02.920 --> 42:04.940
what was going on in Congress and the issues that 
everybody confronted. And a certain area came up

42:09.800 --> 42:11.820
in which we had expertise within the center, 
within the college. We could put a guy on an

42:14.400 --> 42:18.840
airplane and

42:18.820 --> 42:23.130
get him up there to do research and do studies that, 
well

42:25.110 --> 42:33.420
I don't know how big we could get, but clearly, one 
way or another, we are going to have to solve that.

42:37.550 --> 42:43.600
There aren't any of these issues. They almost

42:43.580 --> 42:51.030
always are

42:51.010 --> 42:56.370
a breadth of disciplines. And so some of them we've 
done. What about Erickson? Well, of course,

43:06.000 --> 43:07.021
Erickson deserves a lot of credit for the success 
that he's done. I

43:10.430 --> 43:29.370
don't

43:10.430 --> 43:29.370
know how much you know about him. If you listed

43:29.350 --> 43:40.390
the top, he's brilliant.

43:49.913 --> 43:52.900
A genius. He speaks

43:52.880 --> 43:57.940
six languages, will find

43:57.920 --> 44:04.370
his way through the DFW airport unaided. And

44:07.350 --> 44:17.930
just when a public

44:07.350 --> 44:17.930
relationship with Erickson began, really it

44:18.910 --> 44:25.000
had its roots in the productivity program, if you 
will. I had been appointed to this Air Force

44:31.380 --> 44:33.400
oversight committee to look over the aircraft. 
And

44:34.380 --> 44:42.760
a

44:34.380 --> 44:42.760
young Air Force captain who lived next door to a guy 
by the name of Colonel Lynn Pinson, who is on our

44:49.990 --> 44:53.060
staff here, but

44:53.040 --> 44:57.930
he is on me. And Lynn had been selected as an Air 
Force research associate and had spent a year with

45:04.090 --> 45:06.110
John. And

45:06.090 --> 45:13.960
so through the Air Force captain, I got Lynn's 
name, and he was in the Pentagon at that time and

45:16.940 --> 45:18.960
stopped by to see him. John was visiting.

45:27.290 --> 45:30.230
And then an interesting incident happened. You 
know, you look at these things, dear, and you have

45:32.210 --> 45:33.231
to conclude that somebody upstairs is looking out 
for them, or has enjoyed support from the

45:35.650 --> 45:44.730
Pentagon. Of course, the Pentagon

45:54.440 --> 45:56.460
cannot give money directly to it. And

45:56.440 --> 46:01.660
so it has to be laundered, channeled through. At 
that time, the Air Force was the organization.
