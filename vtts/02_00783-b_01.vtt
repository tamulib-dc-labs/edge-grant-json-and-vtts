WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:16.507
So with the innovation program, they had a thing 
called the TIG, Technology Innovation Group.

00:19.112 --> 00:22.498
And the thrust of this was to try to develop new 
technologies. And as it turned out, this focused

00:22.518 --> 00:25.684
largely on computer technology in all the cities. 
and

00:26.035 --> 00:35.683
waste

00:26.035 --> 00:35.683
disposal technologies and stuff like that. And we 
had I don't know how many cities we eventually

00:37.485 --> 00:43.170
worked with. I think it was something between 50 
and 60 cities in the state of Texas. In addition to

00:48.775 --> 00:54.760
that, we had, through the NSF program, we created a 
backup agency to help Little Rock, Arkansas, and

00:55.634 --> 01:06.092
Boulder, Colorado.

01:06.112 --> 01:09.858
So it was a tremendously successful program. And 
then in the, what, about 76, I guess it was, then we

01:09.979 --> 01:20.697
hired Don Moore, who replaced me as the director of 
the center. And of course it went on up until the

01:22.195 --> 01:36.794
early 80s, and the federal funding report 
disappeared, and things went downhill pretty

01:22.195 --> 01:36.794
rapidly. It was a separate center at that time, and 
I had nothing to do with it. And then

01:46.606 --> 01:52.033
the HUD support dried up and NSF support dried up. 
And I guess, to me, one of the saddest elements of

01:57.305 --> 02:08.736
that whole thing was that the cities wouldn't

01:57.305 --> 02:08.736
support us. And I guess I shouldn't have been too 
surprised at that, but I was.

02:15.863 --> 02:21.008
We had, over the decade of the 70s or the last half of 
it, We had developed,

02:21.815 --> 02:28.428
I thought, excellent rapport with the cities. 
They're very applied in their concerns. And you

02:34.539 --> 02:40.891
have to be careful about the words that you use in 
working with them. For example, we learned rather

02:40.911 --> 02:43.857
quickly, you don't say research. Because when you 
say research, a city councilman in Abilene or

02:44.647 --> 02:57.002
whatever will conjure up some guy in a white coat 
surrounded by test tubes. And they're not

02:57.022 --> 03:01.408
interested in funding anyone, so we called it 
property-solving. But in spite of that, and in

03:01.428 --> 03:12.882
spite of the fact that we had done, I thought, a hell 
of a lot of good things for the cities, Don Moore,

03:01.428 --> 03:12.882
and there was never a more able guy, Don Moore was

03:13.823 --> 03:27.777
just unable to draw any support from Texas cities 
to continue

03:13.823 --> 03:27.777
that. And when Dr. Porter took over TEAS, his edict 
was, if it can't be self-supporting,

03:27.798 --> 03:36.166
I'm not interested in supporting it. And I think 
it's wrong of you, frankly, but because this still

03:36.226 --> 03:41.772
is a land grant college, I think we still have duty

03:44.587 --> 04:04.327
to

03:44.587 --> 04:04.327
help

03:44.587 --> 04:04.327
the people of the state of Texas, and I think that's 
one of the things that we've done. But I went to him

04:04.347 --> 04:10.493
when the Center was essentially given, the 
program operation was essentially given back to

04:04.347 --> 04:10.493
me with a recommendation that put some T's money 
into it to keep it going, because I thought that the

04:04.347 --> 04:10.493
federal funding would eventually swing the 
pendulum and swing back the other way. And there

04:10.844 --> 04:15.170
would be money coming. I've seen these 
oscillations within the

04:15.190 --> 04:26.125
federal staff before, and I thought it would occur 
again. But Skip wasn't interested in that. And

04:26.866 --> 04:31.292
with his background, I didn't understand that. So 
although it still exists on paper, And we still do a

04:36.089 --> 04:40.334
few little things. A

04:40.354 --> 04:46.402
couple of years ago, we did some things for the City 
of Edinburgh in South Texas. And so we still have

04:46.522 --> 04:47.263
that thrust. But as you're aware, there is now a new 
center for affairs set up, which incidentally

04:47.283 --> 05:01.281
draws on some of the faculty that were involved 
with us in the Old Urban Program Center. And that's

05:02.002 --> 05:02.603
great. I think it's nice to have that. The problem 
it will have is that there is no keys

05:06.160 --> 05:15.398
involved, so they won't have any. And so they're 
going to be scraping along with what they can. and

05:17.315 --> 05:42.418
of course

05:17.315 --> 05:42.418
some of the liberal arts faculty and others are 
empowered to use some of their academic time for

05:17.315 --> 05:42.418
research. It's different than it is here at the 
Tees, of course. We want to do research, so we have

05:44.460 --> 05:45.501
to invest in one. But over there, professors are 
given release time from their teaching chores to

05:46.508 --> 05:51.074
do research. And so they can do, you know, they can 
do some things. So there are some guys in liberal

05:54.338 --> 05:57.362
arts that want to do that work with the cities. 
There are a couple, three guys in business

05:57.382 --> 06:02.148
administration. And, of course, Rossler in urban 
planning and architecture. And these are the same

06:07.014 --> 06:13.782
people, at least the same organizations that we 
have involved in the arts of the city. So in any

06:15.550 --> 06:24.663
event, that was too much detail, I'm sure, on the 
Center for Integral Arts. I hadn't really gotten

06:24.743 --> 06:28.749
enough on that chapter or something. It was a 
fascinating time, fascinating experience. The

06:33.015 --> 06:34.397
Center for Strategic Technology, how did that 
come about? Oh, my land. How many more takes did you

06:34.757 --> 06:36.420
have? How much time did you have? We got another 
hour. Hours were a thing. Oh, my. Do you want the

06:44.862 --> 06:46.484
full story on that? I guess so.

06:52.071 --> 06:54.594
Well... Is this your idea? I'm sorry? Is this your 
idea? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I guess. Again, coupled with

07:01.922 --> 07:04.205
Mr. Benson. He deserves credit. Um...

07:07.389 --> 07:12.895
Well... I guess the original ideas

07:14.765 --> 07:30.346
sprang from some things that began to occur in the 
mid-70s.

07:30.366 --> 07:42.122
I think the first time we started even 
verbalizing, he and I, notions that gradually

07:30.366 --> 07:42.122
over a period of time shape themselves into what is 
now the center. I guess that was probably late 74

07:46.223 --> 07:48.566
and mid-75. And the thrust of it was the following. 
It was clear that Texas A&M aspired to greatness.

08:01.524 --> 08:04.348
It wants to be a great university. And it was also 
clear that, you know, as I've already said, back in

08:04.368 --> 08:12.700
the 50s it was a great educational institution. 
But it was a kind of insular sort of,

08:13.220 --> 08:26.774
had very limited viewpoints, very limited 
outlook and outreach. And of course, as the

08:26.794 --> 08:30.777
research program was started by Mr. Rudder and Mr. 
Parson, it flowered. And of course, that outreach

08:33.700 --> 08:37.985
effort expanded. And our worldly awareness, if 
you will, expanded. And there was also a

08:43.578 --> 08:59.011
realization that every great

08:43.578 --> 08:59.011
news, again, if you look at MIT and Stanford and 
Telecom, what makes them great? Well, as we've

08:59.031 --> 09:10.761
already said, it's not their

08:59.031 --> 09:10.761
academic programs.

09:10.781 --> 09:12.702
It's part of the old graduate programs, but 
certainly not undergraduate programs. And

09:12.722 --> 09:13.483
research programs, yeah. But more than that, they 
apply their expertise to

09:13.835 --> 09:37.260
solve problems that are sort of like the old RAIN 
program, problems that are associated with

09:13.835 --> 09:37.260
national

09:13.835 --> 09:37.260
needs.

09:40.447 --> 09:52.459
So, and it also helps to have people appointed

09:40.447 --> 09:52.459
to high places. So you see Henry Kissinger come in 
from Harvard, and the

09:52.479 --> 09:58.205
Secretaries of Defense from MIT and Stanford. And 
that

09:58.225 --> 10:02.750
helps the image of greatness. And what this all 
boiled down to was that we wanted to try to insert

10:02.770 --> 10:09.677
Texas A&M more into national and international 
affairs, more into attacking the great

10:10.028 --> 10:23.709
problems of our time, if you want to be that 
grandiose about it. And it was just felt that in

10:23.729 --> 10:37.690
addition to having a damn good academic program, 
undergraduate and graduate, in addition to

10:23.729 --> 10:37.690
having a damn good research program,

10:23.729 --> 10:37.690
we wanted to do more. we wanted to insert ourselves 
into some of the national decision-making

10:38.243 --> 10:47.071
processes. And I remember writing Mr. Benson a 
memo back in, I think, 75, where I told him I was

10:47.092 --> 11:06.310
concerned about Texas A&M's image as, I think my 
words were, a football, military-oriented Cal

10:47.092 --> 11:06.310
College. an image that

11:07.994 --> 11:26.800
to some extent was

11:07.994 --> 11:26.800
deserved, but to a large extent was not deserved. 
And that I thought we needed to have a, I just called

11:26.820 --> 11:32.848
it a special research program, that would be aimed 
at dispelling that image and creating a new image.

11:32.868 --> 11:36.313
And so I told him some notions I had about how to 
proceed with this. He, I told him that as I surveyed

11:37.880 --> 11:55.947
the faculty that was appropriate to this effort, 
and this has to be guys, I mean these have to be

11:37.880 --> 11:55.947
faculty members who have

11:37.880 --> 11:55.947
national or international reputation. People 
that were sort of like E.F. Hutton, you know, when

11:55.967 --> 12:03.718
they taught folks, listen,

11:55.967 --> 12:03.718
we didn't have them. within

12:04.981 --> 12:16.394
the College of Engineering. I could count them,

12:16.414 --> 12:26.666
again, on the things of my family. And so I told him 
that I thought we ought to get some money from our

12:26.686 --> 12:29.269
affluent graduates, Mr. Sackler and others. We 
always were Mr. Sackler. We always needed money,

12:29.850 --> 12:30.771
and he always used it. And I thought we ought to get a 
little bundle of cash. Well, maybe not such a

12:31.952 --> 12:32.693
little bundle. And we

12:33.922 --> 12:51.664
ought to go by people, people that have clout, 
people that have international expertise. And it

12:51.684 --> 12:52.845
doesn't take many. You need some sort of critical 
mass. I mean, one guy's not going to make it, but

12:57.611 --> 12:58.892
three or four, yeah. Again, if they were working in 
complementary areas, you couldn't have a guy here

12:58.912 --> 13:01.035
and another guy there. To some extent, I'm here 
walking teeth. and uh well in any event that was the

13:04.195 --> 13:30.135
thrust of that memo and he thought that was great 
and so he marched promptly over to the dr williams

13:04.195 --> 13:30.135
office laid it on him and dr williams thought it was 
great but he said it needs to be focused well over

13:04.195 --> 13:30.135
the next uh next few weeks and months he focused it 
And it now exists

13:31.685 --> 13:48.382
as the Center

13:31.685 --> 13:48.382
for Free Enterprise Research and Education. And 
I'll never forget the day that that decision was

13:48.402 --> 13:51.165
made that it was going to be given to economics. Mr. 
Benson came into my office with a characteristic

13:51.185 --> 13:59.193
full of esteem,

13:51.185 --> 13:59.193
and he was livid. And kind of as a sop, why, Dr. 
Williams had put Mr. Madison on the

14:01.638 --> 14:11.430
Board of Advisors or something like that. And 
don't misunderstand. We couldn't fault and do not

14:11.950 --> 14:17.157
fault the thrust of that Senate. It is a very 
worthwhile thing to do, and it's a job that needs to

14:17.177 --> 14:30.953
be done,

14:17.177 --> 14:30.953
and it should be pursued. should be pursued more 
aggressively, frankly, than I think it was

14:31.220 --> 14:36.908
pursued right now. But nonetheless, that 
operation sort of missed the target that we had

14:36.928 --> 14:46.020
originally identified. And so during, that was 
set up about, what, 76, I think, or maybe 77, I can't

14:46.040 --> 14:53.230
remember. But over that next year, I can remember 
Mr. Benson would go to these meetings of that board

14:55.418 --> 15:07.435
of advisors, and he would come back boiling every 
time. And because, again, it was sort of our idea

15:07.455 --> 15:14.906
that had been perverted.

15:17.009 --> 15:22.337
And so by 1977 then, He and I had agreed that we were 
going to make another run. Of course, we had a new

15:31.083 --> 15:44.723
administration at that time, and Dr. Williams was 
out of the scene, out of the picture, and Garvey was

15:31.083 --> 15:44.723
going to have

15:31.083 --> 15:44.723
been taken over. And then some other interesting 
things began to happen in 1977. we had begun to talk

15:52.253 --> 16:07.853
with various government people about this idea,

15:52.253 --> 16:07.853
and trying to get them to help us shape the thing. 
And so we were visited in 77 by some fairly

16:07.873 --> 16:21.450
high-ranking

16:07.873 --> 16:21.450
Air Force men, and they said that You know, we need a 
new

16:21.734 --> 16:35.048
think

16:21.734 --> 16:35.048
tank, a new defense-related think tank to do 
several things. But the reason we need a new one is

16:35.068 --> 16:51.606
that most of the existing think tanks have become 
too institutionalized, or as they put it, one Air

16:35.068 --> 16:51.606
Force officer said, they have become so much a part 
of the Washington scene that they have begun to

16:52.312 --> 17:02.504
feed on, and

16:52.312 --> 17:02.504
we're not getting any fresh things out in any time. 
We need a think tank that will do Soviet studies,

17:02.524 --> 17:16.800
because a lot of our Soviet, existing Soviet 
studies are too much based on the mirror image

17:02.524 --> 17:16.800
syndrome, and what that means is that a 
philosophical

17:17.270 --> 17:33.427
viewpoint which looks at the Soviets as mirror 
images of us, that fundamentally they're just

17:17.270 --> 17:33.427
like us. They think like us. They want the same 
things in the world as we do. They respond to

17:39.113 --> 17:40.915
pressures in the world as we do. Of course, that's 
just not true. But it did, and I did my first Soviet

17:42.136 --> 17:46.821
piece of Soviet work back in 1942. before

17:47.442 --> 18:00.279
I went back to Ohio State for graduate work. And so 
I've seen the mirror

18:00.339 --> 18:08.430
image syndrome in action, and it was exactly 
right. Because I remember thinking that myself

18:08.450 --> 18:09.852
when I was young and ignorant. And so they then 
suggested that this new center, that we had still

18:09.872 --> 18:15.559
somewhat ill-formed in our ought to have a very

18:15.877 --> 18:25.786
definite national security thrust to it. And so 
that was reflected in the way the Senate was

18:25.806 --> 18:31.471
finally shaped. But if you look at our charter, you 
will find that we are empowered

18:31.491 --> 18:43.842
to look at energy systems, transportation 
systems, urban systems. Mr. Benson, bless his

18:45.728 --> 19:07.716
heart, fought

18:45.728 --> 19:07.716
with the center

18:45.728 --> 19:07.716
out and did all kinds of great things. And indeed, 
in the first year of our operation, we were

19:07.736 --> 19:10.780
focused, we had a fairly broad focus. And 
incidentally, he was, was and is of the opinion

19:10.800 --> 19:12.462
that the state of Texas sort of lurches from crisis 
to crisis without any long-range planning. And so

19:20.166 --> 19:38.126
the center's charter states that we will do 
strategic

19:20.166 --> 19:38.126
studies for the state of Texas, long-range 
planning studies for the state of Texas. An

19:38.146 --> 19:38.907
incredibly broad charter. Here again, it's sort 
of, and he gave us some money to get it started, of

19:38.927 --> 19:42.832
course. And he And he had his

19:44.082 --> 20:02.765
characteristic viewpoint about this.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.267
But he knew we were tackling, we were trying to slay 
a much larger dragon. And here, he said, you have

20:04.287 --> 20:06.750
that thing self-supporting for 10 years. And 
that's what it would have taken to have functioned

20:06.770 --> 20:12.958
the way

20:06.770 --> 20:12.958
we had originally started.

20:16.685 --> 20:32.602
So it was really with that charter that he took to 
the Board of Regents in the spring of 78. And I'd

20:33.103 --> 20:36.606
been a visiting professor over at the American 
University in Cairo. And we didn't even have a name

20:38.168 --> 20:43.834
for the damn thing at that time, at least that we had 
settled on. And I remember when I was still in

20:43.854 --> 20:46.557
Cairo, We telexed back and forth, and he had some 
other name for it. And I remember telexing him and

20:53.294 --> 21:04.699
telling him that it ought to be called

20:53.294 --> 21:04.699
the Center for Strategic Technology. And so that 
was the name that went forth to the Board of

21:04.719 --> 21:06.182
Regents. But he talked about the input we'd had 
from the Air Force officers

21:06.837 --> 21:26.980
and the national security issues. He told them 
that it was our intention to do classified work. It

21:28.842 --> 21:30.043
was our intention to work with the intelligence 
agencies. Well, can you imagine going to the Board

21:30.063 --> 21:32.967
of Regents of Berkeley, UC Berkeley, with a 
proposal like that? Never in Christ's name. But

21:33.467 --> 21:35.089
with the rich military traditions, And

21:35.491 --> 21:51.415
so we set about building yet another new program. 
And then, of course, one

21:52.256 --> 22:04.975
year into that,

21:52.256 --> 22:04.975
Mr. Manson retired and Dr. Porter took over. 
Again,

22:05.444 --> 22:19.505
Dr. Porter wasn't interested

22:05.444 --> 22:19.505
in long-term payoff. His directive to me was make 
it self-supporting

22:19.525 --> 22:27.877
as quickly as you can. And he said, I'll give you 
three years. He didn't say that specifically, but

22:30.701 --> 22:33.445
that was the message that I got. Well, the place 
where there is money is DOD. And so we focused our

22:34.667 --> 22:35.248
efforts almost

22:35.718 --> 22:58.766
totally that opportunity. And we were 
self-supporting it for years. Again, starting

22:59.627 --> 23:00.809
from scratch, starting with no credibility. And 
again, you know, even though the program took some

23:00.829 --> 23:03.632
turns that were not originally envisioned, it 
couldn't have happened without Teasman. And so

23:05.468 --> 23:25.354
now we bring

23:05.468 --> 23:25.354
in about a million

23:05.468 --> 23:25.354
bucks

23:05.468 --> 23:25.354
a year. We have about a million dollars a year. Of 
that, I get $90,000 from teams. And the rest of it is

23:28.077 --> 23:28.898
hustle. And I think as of the 1st of August, the 
center will be five years old. And we've had a fair

23:33.304 --> 23:34.986
amount of success. But again, it all starts with 
T's.

23:48.607 --> 23:52.333
Now, the center's focus has merit, right? Because 
of funding? Temporarily, yes. But it is my

23:55.358 --> 23:59.665
intention to broaden it as I can. So once you've got 
one area financially solvent, so... Right. and

24:04.261 --> 24:11.408
then get T's money to broaden that to New York? 
Well,

24:11.428 --> 24:25.681
I don't know that we

24:11.428 --> 24:25.681
can get T's money to New York. I did get a, this next 
year they will give me $120,000. And I intend to use

24:28.564 --> 24:30.085
that additional $30,000 to try to broaden that. 
One of my colleagues, Dr. Bragg, is now

24:33.100 --> 24:59.766
interacting with the governor's office and 
that's a very very slow process but but we are

24:33.100 --> 24:59.766
trying to pursue this responsibility that we have 
to do some advanced planning for the state we have

24:33.100 --> 24:59.766
had a couple little things we did an incredible 
study for the state of texas and see the when the

24:33.100 --> 24:59.766
center was formed Mr. Bradley had left the 
Industrial Economics

25:00.488 --> 25:09.562
Research Division to take over TEKS. And so that 
was brought in to the Center for Strategic

25:09.582 --> 25:14.289
Technology. Again, the thought being that that 
could be the focus for our state efforts. And if

25:22.442 --> 25:23.644
we'd had a little bit more But the economic

25:25.058 --> 25:40.334
development,

25:25.058 --> 25:40.334
industrial development monies began

25:25.058 --> 25:40.334
to dry up. And so we've lost most of the people that

25:40.354 --> 25:46.160
populated that effort. And as a matter of fact, Dr. 
Bragg, I guess, is the only one that's left. But

25:50.645 --> 25:50.965
yes, we will try to live up to the charter

25:51.788 --> 26:01.657
that was originally described for the center. And 
I think our defense program is in relatively good

26:01.677 --> 26:19.874
shape now, and it's just a question of doing the 
necessary promotion and establishing

26:01.677 --> 26:19.874
credibility to get involved in these other areas. 
And I think we can do it. You talk about

26:22.619 --> 26:30.110
interdisciplinary work problems. Mostly you're 
dealing with engineering, but in this center you

26:30.130 --> 26:41.226
have to

26:30.130 --> 26:41.226
go outside of engineering. Is that a bigger 
problem, or is it pretty much the same as just

26:41.246 --> 26:45.572
getting engineers to work? Oh, it's basically the 
same problem there, but it's... It has a little bit

26:52.336 --> 27:00.425
different connotation to it, a little bit 
different complexion to it, I guess I should say.

27:00.945 --> 27:01.947
Yeah, you're right. We have had in the center, in 
this center, people from folks in sociology

27:03.348 --> 27:16.943
working for us right now. We've had people from 
history, from

27:21.007 --> 27:42.489
business

27:21.007 --> 27:42.489
administration, one guy from architecture, and a 
few from engineering. The problems we encounter

27:42.509 --> 27:48.735
in that are, well, we still have this problem of Say 
we have a person from sociology who's going to work

27:50.943 --> 27:57.012
for us. Well, okay, suppose he or she comes over and 
just does some really outstanding work for us. I

28:08.248 --> 28:12.374
can't affect their promotion. Their promotion is 
handled through the sociology department. So the

28:16.540 --> 28:19.684
only damn thing I can do, do-do, is to, in the fall of 
the year, when tenure and promotion concerns

28:20.187 --> 28:43.483
are operational, I write the dean and the 
department head of the appropriate college and

28:20.187 --> 28:43.483
department head and give them an accounting of how 
that person has performed. And that's the most I

28:43.503 --> 28:47.089
can do. So I guess that's the most difficult 
problem we have. The other problem deals with

28:53.988 --> 29:02.057
classified work. And here again, you have to 
assess the attitude

29:02.077 --> 29:11.167
of the dean and department head in question. If 
they want a young man or a young woman to publish,

29:11.187 --> 29:18.375
then you dastardly get them involved in 
classified work. And

29:19.840 --> 29:31.475
so on those, when we encounter that situation, 
we've had a few circumstances. There's a man in

29:31.495 --> 29:41.027
political science, whom I will not name, who has 
been interested in our work. But I have had to take

29:41.047 --> 29:45.392
him aside and tell him, look, getting involved 
with us may be hazardous to your academic health.

29:51.528 --> 30:00.524
And of course in that case we have a department that 
is controlled not by the dean, not by the

29:51.528 --> 30:00.524
department head, but by a committee of four 
professors. And none of whom are Soviet experts,

30:02.007 --> 30:08.519
none of whom give a flip for Soviet work. And so A 
young man ain't going to ride Soviet boat

30:09.250 --> 30:21.607
to promotion and tenure in that department 
because it has to be approved by the full press. And

30:21.627 --> 30:38.650
so he has to be, in effect, a traitor to his own cause 
and go over the hurdles that they set up for him,

30:21.627 --> 30:38.650
namely, you know, you will do such and such kind of 
work, you will publish in this journal and that

30:21.627 --> 30:38.650
journal, but not in those, and you won't publish 
things through the Senate, which would be in the

30:21.627 --> 30:38.650
court, you know. And so in that case, then, what we 
tend to do, we tend to do two things. We will go to a

30:46.997 --> 31:00.231
tenured full professor who has all of these things 
and can tell the department head or the dean to go to

30:46.997 --> 31:00.231
him and get him involved. And we have some of those. 
Or we'll go outside. If

31:05.596 --> 31:29.120
you walk across the hall, across the office area, 
you'll meet Dr. Jamie Kipp. He's from Kansas

31:29.140 --> 31:29.600
State. A historian. Tremendous guy. He's an 
expert on the Soviet Navy, an expert on the Soviet

31:30.201 --> 31:32.023
military, doing the Soviet Navy. Incredible guy. 
And he has, he has, we have a summer fellows program

31:32.363 --> 31:33.524
here. Because many of these guys have nine months 
And

31:34.722 --> 31:44.192
so he is here for his second summer. And then we 
support him and his graduating students during

31:44.212 --> 31:51.660
the year. This is with federal money. And we've had 
Dr. Bill Fuller at the Harvard Russian Research

31:54.984 --> 31:57.887
Center. Can you imagine Texas A&M sponsoring work 
at Harvard? It happens. Dr. Bill Zimmerman,

32:01.655 --> 32:17.419
the University of Michigan, Dr. Ivan Volkis,

32:01.655 --> 32:17.419
the University of Nebraska. We will have two 
gentlemen from the Air Force Academy with us this

32:17.439 --> 32:19.242
summer for short stays. He's going to Scotland. 
Oh, Erickson. Well, I wasn't... He's not Summer

32:25.086 --> 32:28.291
Phillip, but that's a... That's a special case. We 
have to talk about John.

32:37.985 --> 32:41.150
But, you know, there's somebody else... I don't 
know their U.S. But in any event...

32:50.238 --> 33:00.467
That's

32:50.238 --> 33:00.467
the general way we've solved that problem.

33:01.108 --> 33:13.939
Now, let me pursue this, because it may be of 
interest to whomever is listening to this tape a

33:01.108 --> 33:13.939
hundred years from

33:01.108 --> 33:13.939
now. Dr. Porter has suggested that we might go hire 
a full-time research instead of using faculty to

33:19.870 --> 33:27.259
staff our research teams. And he and I have had 
another rather serious disagreement over

33:27.279 --> 33:34.749
that. And

33:34.829 --> 33:43.239
don't misunderstand me. We just have different 
points of view here. We're not wild-eyed enemies

33:44.141 --> 33:45.002
of one another. I think we have a great deal of 
respect for one another. But I have trouble with

33:47.265 --> 33:48.426
that. because my view is if you're going to have 
full-time research people, then why the hell not

33:48.997 --> 34:00.495
have a Southwest Research Institute or a Battelle 
or whatever? Or putting it the other way, my view is

34:00.515 --> 34:17.181
that anybody that our principal job as an 
institution is teaching still, and you can talk

34:00.515 --> 34:17.181
about the research program and you can talk about 
influencing national decision-making

34:00.515 --> 34:17.181
processes, but all of that ought to impact the 
teaching and educational process, the

34:17.718 --> 34:29.496
intellectual development of the young people, 
because that's why we're here, first and

34:17.718 --> 34:29.496
fundamentally.

34:29.516 --> 34:40.913
And so having a bunch of people that never see a 
student, never go into a classroom, I don't dig

34:29.516 --> 34:40.913
that at all. I have great philosophical

34:47.013 --> 34:59.388
But if we can't solve some of these other problems, 
if I can't get my hands on the faculty

34:47.013 --> 34:59.388
that I need, then what am I to do? I guess I can either 
say, well, you know, we will attenuate the growth

34:59.929 --> 35:14.286
of the center to fit whatever we can draw on, or we 
can go out and have the answer.

35:17.573 --> 35:28.385
Well,

35:17.573 --> 35:28.385
he and I had a rather serious discussion about that 
about six months ago. And I was ready to submit

35:28.405 --> 35:37.315
my resignation letter because it was just 
philosophically not acceptable to me. But we came

35:37.335 --> 35:39.056
to an accommodation. And what we agreed

35:39.277 --> 35:46.905
was that as long as 50% of the program would somehow 
impact the

35:47.392 --> 35:55.239
teaching function. Fine. When

35:55.380 --> 36:01.726
it gets to be 51%, that's when I leave. So that's

36:01.746 --> 36:10.634
the interdisciplinary problem is a far reaching 
one. It has a lot of impact, as you can see from this

36:10.674 --> 36:14.698
discussion.

36:17.665 --> 36:20.328
And I don't know how to solve it. Because certainly 
other colleges, other departments

36:22.971 --> 36:33.522
have

36:22.971 --> 36:33.522
different views. And of course, there are those 
who think that the center is a wrong operation. In

36:41.070 --> 36:47.217
other words, they will say, as soon as you take 
money from DOD, you're sold. and I say, your ass is

36:48.091 --> 36:56.621
bought, that you're dancing to their tune. Well, I 
suppose

36:56.641 --> 37:07.274
with some that may be true, but it's not true here. 
And now it's true that DOD will tell us, they will

37:07.294 --> 37:11.199
give us money to do a specific piece of research. I 
mean, they will give you, well, incredible as it

37:11.219 --> 37:16.545
may seem, I have got a little chunk of money And

37:17.993 --> 37:35.056
the guy said, I asked

37:17.993 --> 37:35.056
him, I said, what do you want to do with it? Is there 
anything you want to do with it? Which is . That's

37:38.882 --> 37:39.382
not strictly true. It has to be related to space 
things, but within the space of anything that you

37:39.402 --> 37:41.405
want to do. But most of it, most of them, all the rest 
of the money that we get out of it is specifically

37:41.425 --> 37:43.528
the record. So they do specify the topics that we 
study, but they don't specify the way we do our

37:44.285 --> 37:59.927
research. And above all, they don't specify the 
results of our research.

38:06.677 --> 38:11.404
And I don't have

38:06.677 --> 38:11.404
any problem with that. I don't think it restricts 
us at all. So, but clearly if, and already because

38:13.090 --> 38:25.121
of the success we have had, Dr. Porter has asked me, 
how big is the center going to get? How big do you

38:25.141 --> 38:27.483
want to be? Because I think he perceives that we 
could probably be almost as big as we wanted to be.

38:35.670 --> 38:37.152
And that's a good question. I don't know. My answer 
to him was a kind of a pat answer. an evasive answer

38:41.103 --> 38:56.511
because I said to him that I want to be as big as we 
have to be to meet our service needs to Texas A&M.

38:56.531 --> 39:01.941
And I

38:56.531 --> 39:01.941
don't really know what that is. I don't know how 
many faculty might want to get involved with us.

39:04.087 --> 39:14.198
when it comes to influence any national 
decision-making processes, I do want to insert

39:04.087 --> 39:14.198
Texas A&M into that process, into that whole 
business. I want to see more Texas A&M faculty

39:14.903 --> 39:20.850
testifying before Congress. When I was at 
Maryland, it just hurt me. It still hurts me to go to

39:23.613 --> 39:42.754
Washington and when Congress needs expertise, 
and law would be not always, but most of the time

39:23.613 --> 39:42.754
will be some guy from MIT or Stanford, and that just 
gripes

39:23.613 --> 39:42.754
me badly. And there are times when when a 
southwestern

39:45.127 --> 40:07.098
viewpoint on

39:45.127 --> 40:07.098
certain national issues needs to

39:45.127 --> 40:07.098
be inserted. And that's not to say that we've got 
all the right answers or anything. But you know,

40:11.545 --> 40:14.509
we've, you know, back in 20 years ago, we had guys 
like Lyndon Johnson and John Connery and Holden

40:11.545 --> 40:14.509
Teague and

40:15.147 --> 40:23.823
many others who represented this area. Now, I 
wouldn't want to say that I supported those guys in

40:23.843 --> 40:36.807
everything they did or said, because I didn't. On 
the other hand, they represented the area well.

40:37.849 --> 40:39.231
They inserted regional

40:40.662 --> 40:57.779
viewpoints into the national decision-making 
processes. And now they're gone. And Conley's

40:58.240 --> 41:00.702
still around, of course, but he's not influential 
anymore in the national sense. And I think to some

41:00.722 --> 41:08.610
extent, we can't fill those shoes, but to some 
extent, We ought to try. I think one of the things we

41:11.866 --> 41:23.805
can do is to represent the people of the state of 
Texas in some of these matters. And

41:23.825 --> 41:33.720
so I want us to pursue that as aggressively as we 
can. Well, I've testified before Congress, but

41:34.510 --> 41:48.564
it's been a situation where I'm sitting here in the 
fold around a friend of mine in Washington who knew

41:34.510 --> 41:48.564
that I had certain kinds of expertise, would say, 
hey, Dick, could you come on and offer some

41:34.510 --> 41:48.564
testimony? Yeah. Well, that's a passive system. 
And Aggies ain't passive. We're active. And so

41:56.352 --> 42:02.678
what I would like to do is to have a situation where 
we could understand what was going on in Congress

42:02.945 --> 42:11.476
and the issues that they were going to be 
confronting. When a certain area came up in which

42:11.556 --> 42:25.033
we had expertise, not here within the center, but 
within the college or within the university, that

42:11.556 --> 42:25.033
we could put a guy on an airplane and get him up there 
before Congress. And that we could do research and

42:25.053 --> 42:30.420
do studies that would influence some of the 
actions. So I don't know how big we're going to

42:30.440 --> 42:32.142
grow. that clearly one way or another we are going 
to have to solve that problem of doing

42:33.168 --> 42:41.822
interdisciplinary work. Because there aren't 
any of these issues that are narrowly focused.

42:49.575 --> 42:57.568
They almost always

42:49.575 --> 42:57.568
involve a breadth of disciplines. So somehow 
we've got to solve that problem. Well,

43:01.653 --> 43:19.673
of course, Erickson deserves a lot of credit for 
the success

43:01.653 --> 43:19.673
that

43:01.653 --> 43:19.673
the cinema has had. I first met John in 1979, just 
about the time that the cinema was formed. I don't

43:28.130 --> 43:31.254
know how much you know about John Erickson. Oh, I 
know a little to the history part. Yeah,

43:33.797 --> 43:35.579
hopefully. Well, he's, if you listed the top five 
or six Western criminologists

43:35.979 --> 43:50.897
or experts on the Soviet military, that he would 
have to be among them. He's a brilliant man, a

43:50.917 --> 43:54.762
genius by any standard. speaks six languages 
fully as a

43:55.332 --> 44:03.845
photographic memory. Couldn't find his way 
through the DFW airport unaided if his life

44:03.865 --> 44:17.386
depended on it, you know, he's a thoroughgoing 
academician and just one public man. The

44:17.406 --> 44:20.310
relationship with Erickson began

44:23.463 --> 44:30.211
Really, it had its roots in the productivity 
program, if you believe. I had been appointed to

44:30.411 --> 44:39.921
this Air Force oversight committee

44:30.411 --> 44:39.921
to look over the equipment for the whole program. 
You see, the ICANN program, the manufacturing

44:39.941 --> 44:41.023
program. And a young Air Force captain who was 
involved in that program lived next door to a guy

44:41.043 --> 44:50.213
who had been a member of the Colonel Lynn Kelsey. 
who is on our staff here, but he is on Lynn. And Lynn

44:58.073 --> 45:09.323
had been selected as an Air Force Research 
Associate and had spent a year with John over in

44:58.073 --> 45:09.323
Illinois. And so, through this Air Force Captain, 
I got Lynn's name and he was in the Pentagon at that

45:09.343 --> 45:19.272
time and stopped by to see him. And that led to 
John's visiting Texas A&M. And then an

45:28.033 --> 45:32.240
interesting incident happened. You know, you 
look at these things, dear, and you have to prove

45:32.260 --> 45:38.611
that somebody upstairs is looking out for you. 
It's incredible how these things happen. John has

45:42.370 --> 45:53.203
enjoyed support from the Pentagon for many years 
because of his incredible

45:42.370 --> 45:53.203
understanding of the Second Posture. But of 
course the Pentagon cannot give money directly to

45:53.864 --> 45:59.430
