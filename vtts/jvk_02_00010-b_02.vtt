00:00:02.326 --> 00:00:24.756
particular is we should be more broad in our acceptance of things and less, I think there's too much of a

00:00:25.782 --> 00:00:27.164
hang the guilty bastard.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:32.553
I mean, you have to have some more tolerance, I believe, in the programs.

00:00:32.573 --> 00:00:44.112
I've seen young people here that thought they were doing right, and they were crucified, and they lost their commissions, they lost their

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:53.662
Well, they were actually given a chance to get their degree, but they did not get their commissions.

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:59.910
They did not because of the Corps and its hard approach to things.

00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:10.523
Is A&M on a correct path in trying to emphasize the practical instead of the theoretical?

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:15.870
Well, I think myself that

00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:20.392
We need the theory.

00:01:20.512 --> 00:01:24.380
We need to put the theory into practice.

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:31.215
But when we make a mistake, let's go back and correct it and not cry about that forever.

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:36.306
So I think that you need to have a can-do attitude.

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:45.364
Produce what you can in a theoretical way and then correct the mistakes as you go.

00:01:48.387 --> 00:01:50.348
I've got about three questions left.

00:01:50.408 --> 00:02:03.139
If someone walked up to you and handed you a check for a million dollars for you to pass on to Texas A&M, what would you want that money used for?

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:06.462
If you could make a major gift to A&M, what would you want to

00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:16.515
Well, I think I'd put about half of it in recruiting for the Corps.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:29.977
I think that's very important, getting along with people, to learn organization, to learn management, to learn what all needs to go into getting along with people.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:37.549
I think I'd put the other half into supporting research.

00:02:39.011 --> 00:02:39.452
In what?

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:48.741
In general academics.

00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:51.744
So you're not saying limit it to a certain major?

00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:57.249
I'm not going to limit it to energy and mineral resources that I ran for 10 years.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.731
I'm not going to do that.

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:04.056
Because I think there are many disciplines in the liberal arts area.

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:06.038
I think we need a music program here.

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.140
I understand we're getting one.

00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:11.249
We need arts programs.

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:18.816
We need a very liberal and wide-ranging curriculum.

00:03:18.836 --> 00:03:27.585
To what A&M former students, faculty, staff, et cetera, do you feel most indebted, grateful, and why?

00:03:29.847 --> 00:03:30.808
Would you say that again?

00:03:30.828 --> 00:03:31.489
To whom?

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.933
What people related to A&M do you feel most grateful?

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:41.195
Could be a student, a faculty, a staff, anybody.

00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:47.843
Well, I think I'm most grateful for my professors.

00:03:49.105 --> 00:04:01.279
And I think that the fact that we have a close camaraderie with guys that we came here with and had throughout the time here.

00:04:02.187 --> 00:04:06.999
and I think continued camaraderie through the Association of Former Students.

00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:09.485
I think that's very important.

00:04:10.548 --> 00:04:11.250
Last question.

00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:16.062
What feelings do you have in your heart for Texas A&M today?

00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:17.885
I love it.

00:04:18.606 --> 00:04:19.327
I still do.

00:04:20.608 --> 00:04:30.922
I still love Texas A&M, and if I had a million dollars, I'd probably give them part of it, like giving to the church, you know, 10% or more.

00:04:32.384 --> 00:04:46.723
But I love the days I had here, and even though I went on to Caltech and got my Ph.D. and all of that, I think my undergraduate days are what formed me as a person.

00:04:47.497 --> 00:04:51.921
and taught me the value of living and being a good person.

00:04:53.082 --> 00:04:54.163
I took in candy.

00:04:54.383 --> 00:04:59.368
I sold candy in the dormitory also to help.

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:09.538
As a matter of fact, I bought some bonds, war bonds, you know, with the money I made from taking in cleaning and pressing and from selling candy.

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:12.681
And that's the money I got buried on.

00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:17.385
That's the only money I had.

00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:19.227
But that was a great life.

00:05:20.252 --> 00:05:21.597
I've had a great life.

00:05:21.678 --> 00:05:27.021
I don't think I'd change very much if I had to do over again.
