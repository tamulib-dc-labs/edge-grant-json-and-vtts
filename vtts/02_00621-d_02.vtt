WEBVTT

00:17.378 --> 00:30.570
institutional idea, man, to realize that there 
were two constraints on what was going on in Navy

00:17.378 --> 00:30.570
research. If you had a private industry, that 
company had to make profit.

00:37.856 --> 00:45.683
If you had the Navy, you had to have something to go 
on a ship to fight a war with.

00:45.703 --> 00:45.883
And This did put constraint on people's thinking.

00:51.985 --> 01:00.957
The worst case that I had was in a certain 
laboratory where when I'd go down to talk about the

00:51.985 --> 01:00.957
research program, they would put the comptroller 
in his head at the table. And just the fact of the

01:02.859 --> 01:16.157
man's presence there with the dollar sign 
swinging from his neck almost made the fellows in

01:02.859 --> 01:16.157
the laboratory very cautious and even cut down on 
what I thought I wanted to see. The biggest single

01:18.112 --> 01:40.823
thing that I know of, two biggest single things 
that I know of to handle this problem was Gordon

01:18.112 --> 01:40.823
Lill's beginning the informal coordinating 
committee on oceanography and Finn and Jennings

01:18.112 --> 01:40.823
and Fetter and Lill and Maxwell and others 
initiating the Tannock plans. At least This

01:44.639 --> 01:49.547
answers the criticism of the Navy that we were just 
asking for carte blanche. At least we indicated

01:50.389 --> 01:55.117
where we hoped to go, and they could buy it or not buy 
it. Unfortunately, they didn't buy it.

02:05.574 --> 02:10.022
While working in Scripps, while you were involved 
in doing research,

02:14.457 --> 02:41.967
Well, they let me work on bathy thermographs a 
little bit, and things of that kind, and little

02:14.457 --> 02:41.967
projects of measuring temperature in the sea, but 
really the GI Bill of Rights carried the tuition,

02:14.457 --> 02:41.967
and I was so unfitted to be a scientist that it took 
all my time really to keep up at all. Dr. on the final

02:42.993 --> 02:47.117
verbal exam. He gave us a lecture on the Gulf Stream 
the day before. And the next day, my examination in

02:52.702 --> 02:59.949
French was the exact text that he had coded from. 
The text of the Gulf Stream. That's where his

03:02.812 --> 03:12.561
genius lay, that he knew I'd never get through my 
language requirement otherwise.

03:13.081 --> 03:18.108
Now, while you're though at Scripps, now Ravel 
comes back, doesn't he? Ravel came back as

03:19.750 --> 03:33.930
director of MPL, it seems to me, and a co-director 
with Carl Eckert at one time. I remember just about

03:34.010 --> 03:38.616
the time we left Scripps, he came back, yes. I don't 
know what, I'm confused as to what he was, where he

03:39.119 --> 03:46.329
was, 46 to 48, I don't know. Okay. Do you seem to 
remember, was his return back to Scripps welcomed

03:49.153 --> 03:55.642
with enthusiasm or not welcomed with enthusiasm? 
Oh, I think so. I think so, and I, with all due

03:57.665 --> 04:04.315
respect to... Carl Eckhart? No, the director, 
present director of Scripps. Nirenberg?

04:08.140 --> 04:08.721
Nirenberg. who has

04:09.157 --> 04:16.230
made, I think, a very, very wonderful record. It 
was something of a surprise, though, that when the

04:17.492 --> 04:29.434
big university campus was established, to many of 
us, that Roger didn't get it. Throughout the

04:29.454 --> 04:32.059
University of California at San Diego? Now, here 
again, it could be... It's a difference in aim and

04:36.085 --> 04:39.309
the necessities of the case. The University of 
California had, what, 20,000 students they had to

04:40.010 --> 04:48.782
take care of, whereas Roger wanted to make Scripps 
an ivory tower of excellence. And as a matter of

04:49.683 --> 04:53.628
fact, the compromise worked out pretty well, I 
think. But you can see what the very strong

04:54.329 --> 05:01.819
feelings must have been at the time, and who was 
right, I don't know. Well... The whole point of

05:03.123 --> 05:11.210
this being is that in this period of time, several 
oceanographic institutions are rising into

05:03.123 --> 05:11.210
periods of excellence. As a matter of fact, 
Challengers to Woodhull, turning out competent

05:11.270 --> 05:15.613
PhDs. What was your impression of the sudden 
implosion and explosion of oceanography between

05:15.633 --> 05:26.102
about 45, really 48 and 56, first of all? I thought 
it was terribly exciting sitting over at the

05:27.984 --> 05:31.066
Bureau of Ships. I was called in on... as

05:33.447 --> 05:37.873
a representative to watch it. I remember the 
International Geophysical Year was such a

05:38.153 --> 05:53.112
wonderful move forward, and yet you'll have to 
look at that we had some very practical men at the

05:38.153 --> 05:53.112
head of it. There were four institutions who got 
the majority of the funding of that year. On the

05:59.942 --> 06:02.987
east coast it was Columbus, Island, and Woods 
Hole. On the west coast it was Revelle and Scripps.

06:05.070 --> 06:12.000
And I won't say satellites, but Miami on one side, 
Texas A&M on the other. That's the way it went. And

06:13.822 --> 06:18.829
as soon as that had been decided, then they got down 
to basic research. As soon as they split the funds

06:18.849 --> 06:20.772
up. I didn't say that.

06:25.399 --> 06:25.459
The In the early days, it was a very lucky thing that 
people who had the broad vision and also the

06:26.401 --> 06:40.533
ability to write these papers on which large 
amounts of money were transferred were still

06:26.401 --> 06:40.533
around. Plus Wakelin over in R&D there. It was just 
a bunch of wonderful coincidences, plus a devoted

06:45.457 --> 06:53.925
effort on the part of everybody involved. These 
people were... were dead serious. They had a

06:56.864 --> 06:57.625
dream. And, uh, Morris Ewing had his, Ravel had 
his, Spitter had his, and the, Columbus had his.

07:08.784 --> 07:19.763
The, the great leaders of that old Harrison 
Brown's Oceanographic, uh, National

07:08.784 --> 07:19.763
Oceanographic Committee, marvelous. the job 
that they did. Did you seem to think that Sputnik in

07:21.684 --> 07:27.109
57 put much input into the development of 
oceanography? Yes, it did from the popular mind.

07:28.951 --> 07:34.176
Very, very decidedly so, as Rechnitz and the 
others will tell you, and I've talked it over with

07:28.951 --> 07:34.176
him. I had him down here to talk about it. The 
Trieste deep dive to the Marianas Trench was the

07:37.599 --> 07:50.172
only big outstanding scientific event that we 
could show in the earth sciences field that in

07:37.599 --> 07:50.172
magnitude came anywhere close to Sputnik. And it 
was our only answer to it for some time then. I think

07:55.550 --> 07:59.414
the Trieste Diver was completely justified on 
that one basis. That has to be the only basis. What

08:02.957 --> 08:03.818
about Moho? Moho got mixed up in the politics.

08:13.066 --> 08:16.669
Perhaps it's well that it didn't go through with 
all the expense because of the plate theory. Now it

08:16.709 --> 08:19.331
seems to say that they wouldn't have found too much 
anyhow. I don't know. But I would have liked to have

08:20.527 --> 08:24.852
seen it done. There's a cute story in connection 
with that. Gordon Little had to answer a letter to

08:28.177 --> 08:31.681
ONR from an old Navy chief. Please don't let them 
bore that hole in the ocean because you know what's

08:31.701 --> 08:35.105
going to happen. All gravity is going to leak out of 
it and we'll all be out and out of space.

08:42.110 --> 08:50.686
How do you explain the politics that were 
obviously involved in Moho vis-a-vis what seems

08:42.110 --> 08:50.686
to be a lack of politics in the Trieste mission? Am I 
misconstruing those two missions? No, not at all.

08:57.619 --> 09:00.424
The Trieste was a single agency thing. Bob Dietz 
went over there and came back with a wonderful

09:01.126 --> 09:05.113
report.

09:06.562 --> 09:16.176
When I bought the view, I remember sitting around 
at the conference table, about nine people, and

09:06.562 --> 09:16.176
me, I'm scared of the dark and all that sort of 
stuff. And I said, well, who in the world would go

09:16.196 --> 09:19.080
down in the dark thing anyhow? And to my amazement, 
nine people's hands, who I highly respected as

09:19.401 --> 09:25.990
scientists as well as administrators, went up. 
And with that encouragement, O&R had it. Now, O&R,

09:28.734 --> 09:36.125
after that big dive, though, it was a white 
elephant to them. Yeah. And we took it over, and it

09:36.683 --> 09:50.225
was a white elephant to us to a certain extent, 
except that what we learned from it about deep

09:36.683 --> 09:50.225
submergence and the hull stuff, which is a whole 
area in itself that I think more than justified

09:36.683 --> 09:50.225
doing it. But again, it was two agencies, not more 
than two agencies talking, where my captain could

09:50.726 --> 09:58.919
say, yes, we'll put $800,000 on the line. And in 
Mohul, there's more than two agencies,

10:00.241 --> 10:02.725
certainly. Well, AMSOC was a social drinking 
society and a good time society taken over by

10:03.194 --> 10:15.431
Bascom and his group as the name of their 
committee. And you had people from the scientific

10:16.112 --> 10:21.981
as well as the industrial. You had to bring in the 
industrial people. The Navy couldn't do it all by

10:24.544 --> 10:30.012
themselves, even on the survey part of it. And so 
your politics got into it, and then, of course, it

10:30.818 --> 10:38.607
got into Brown and Root, and there you are. Would 
you like to make any comments about Brown and Root?

10:43.473 --> 10:47.338
No, I won't make any comments, because I didn't 
know anything about it, except what I read in the

10:43.473 --> 10:47.338
papers. I just thought that it ballooned quite a 
lot.

10:54.747 --> 10:59.172
Now, after 57, when the first expansion of... 
Well, between 57 and 63, you create oceanography

11:00.569 --> 11:09.002
departments all across the country, largely with 
funds aided by ONR. ONR directed and affected the

11:09.102 --> 11:12.748
development of those old departments of 
oceanography. What about the Bureau of Ships'

11:13.128 --> 11:15.031
role in that?

11:17.855 --> 11:27.370
Well, I think that's when my programs began to 
become solely dependent upon ONR in support of

11:27.890 --> 11:33.418
good research like Waldo Lyon and Gene Lafon and 
others in the Navy laboratories. There was a

11:33.438 --> 11:49.480
function of support of research wherever it was 
that ONR had to fulfill and of course you had to take

11:33.438 --> 11:49.480
care of its own parent organization's outfits and 
with few exceptions we had good scientists on

11:33.438 --> 11:49.480
those programs. The use Another thing that was 
occurring at that time was that the old know-how

11:54.552 --> 12:11.654
was going out of the Bureau of Ships, and actually 
out of the Navy, being contracted to industrial

11:54.552 --> 12:11.654
firms, and this called for more and more 
reorganization and more diversification. It had

12:11.674 --> 12:21.606
to be, for instance, people in the landlocked 
states of Idaho and places like that began to get

12:11.674 --> 12:21.606
into oceanography. study programs, well, that's 
all right. Some of the best geologists came out of

12:24.762 --> 12:29.147
Arizona. Now, what's your reaction to your 
reorganization now as your bureau changes,

12:30.769 --> 12:38.820
really, in this period?

12:43.186 --> 12:49.534
What really changed and what ended my program as I 
knew it, and it was time for me to retire when it did,

12:50.881 --> 12:55.505
was when the source of funds at ONR were changed. 
There is a category called 6.1, which is the

12:55.866 --> 13:03.693
research end of the whole research and 
development testing material train. And as long

13:04.794 --> 13:16.124
as I had the money from ONR, I could have this 20% and 
30% freedom of basic research in my laboratory

13:04.794 --> 13:16.124
programs. But after that went out, And I think it 
was in order to support the MISAR that year. And

13:23.461 --> 13:29.167
I've gotten over all bitterness about the 
decision. This left only the next category, which

13:30.128 --> 13:36.434
administrators could not apply to research. They 
had to apply to development. And this meant that a

13:39.578 --> 13:48.647
great many of the people I had ceased to be funded or 
were turned on to projects, which were, what is Mr.

13:49.488 --> 13:53.492
Mansfield's relevance. Funding based upon 
relevance. And I think that perhaps this division

13:55.693 --> 14:05.222
of authority, certainly they have carried it out 
to the Hydrographic Office even right now. That's

14:06.403 --> 14:07.304
my next question. It seems to me that after the 
Mansfield Amendment, as it's called, there

14:07.384 --> 14:19.174
seemed to be a retiring in the upper echelons of all 
the agencies involved in oceanography. is that

14:19.610 --> 14:25.995
because of age factors or because of the change in 
the direction of the bureaucratic institutions?

14:28.438 --> 14:30.199
Well, I think it was a lot of things. I think the 
main, perhaps to me, the main thing was the change

14:30.219 --> 14:45.692
of administration just as the

14:30.219 --> 14:45.692
Stratton Report came out. I think if the Stratton 
Report had come out at the beginning of, say, Jack

14:49.259 --> 14:52.504
Kennedy's administration, you would have seen a 
completely different picture. Okay. Did you find

14:53.526 --> 14:59.675
the Nixon administration less receptive to 
research and development than the Kennedy

14:53.526 --> 14:59.675
administration? I wasn't then under Nixon for 
very long.

15:05.644 --> 15:17.663
Did you notice a... Do you understand any 
political climate before the Mansfield

15:05.644 --> 15:17.663
Amendment that seems to indicate that direction 
towards applied research on it? In other words,

15:19.837 --> 15:22.100
did the Mansfield Amendment take you by surprise?

15:26.927 --> 15:36.460
Well, I'm a person who has to get his news filtered 
down because I don't like to be shocked every

15:26.927 --> 15:36.460
morning by the reversals of decisions. So I was so 
far out of the politics of the thing, and really my

15:37.501 --> 15:43.850
opinion would be absolutely worthless on that. I 
do think that this... proliferation that you've

15:49.587 --> 16:19.155
spoken of had already gone on and the types of 
research for which well you can always nitpick and

15:49.587 --> 16:19.155
I think the climate changed because I don't in my 
opinion

15:49.587 --> 16:19.155
I don't believe the administration under 
President Johnson understood oceanography to

15:49.587 --> 16:19.155
the same extent that the seagoing, yachting-type 
people of Kennedy did. And

16:24.077 --> 16:39.399
for what it's worth, it's my opinion, there's a 
change of administration, and then the, well, you

16:24.077 --> 16:39.399
had the Vietnam War on top of your work. The money 
was, the armed services were needing every nickel

16:39.459 --> 16:49.092
to keep going, and there were some, some things had 
to be and I think I have no objection to what

16:49.561 --> 16:53.986
Mansfield said at that time. I do hope that it will 
not be always so literally applied. While you were

16:59.432 --> 17:10.123
at the Bureau of Ships, did you seem to, did there 
seem to be an increase in international

16:59.432 --> 17:10.123
oceanography, if I coin a word for you, 
international cooperation that you were aware

16:59.432 --> 17:10.123
of? I was aware of it simply because of the people 
that were involved. Gene Lafon, who was my man at

17:14.328 --> 17:17.391
NUC, I was over as a secretary of the

17:17.860 --> 17:25.169
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Committee. 
Warren Worcester, who was my classmate at

17:25.189 --> 17:29.394
Scripps, was over there for a long while. And such 
international meetings as, well, the big one, of

17:30.436 --> 17:37.424
course, was the 1959 International Congress in 
New York. And I didn't get in on all the others, but I

17:38.145 --> 17:41.209
got in on a few of them. And yes, I would say among 
them, Well, even to some extent with the Russians,

17:44.438 --> 17:49.747
I thought there was a great increase of 
information. Did this come as a surprise to you as a

17:50.147 --> 17:55.396
man largely always attached to naval 
functionaries? Not really, because as far as I can

17:56.778 --> 18:01.947
see, the pattern is that when they know more than we 
do, we don't hear from them. When we know more than

18:01.967 --> 18:04.150
they do, they're always there. So I'm rather 
cynical on that question. Many accomplished, you

18:10.696 --> 18:18.527
know, there are no shows in certain fields.

18:20.530 --> 18:33.229
Finally, tell me what you think were the great 
instrumentational breakthroughs

18:20.530 --> 18:33.229
which seemed to shape oceanography, or change the 
nature of oceanography for you, beside the BT.

18:34.791 --> 18:36.413
Precision depth recorder. Precision depth 
recorder. That is what you think... They

18:40.868 --> 18:50.380
started Woods Hole and perfected it much more, the 
oceanographic tower. This is inshore stuff.

19:01.974 --> 19:06.640
You have to give airborne heat surveys to their 
proper place.

19:12.138 --> 19:20.126
The oceanographic ship as an entity and as a tool, 
not just here and there, but as a necessary tool for

19:12.138 --> 19:20.126
each institution.

19:26.813 --> 19:32.779
The satellite navigation and the underwater 
sound positioning.

19:35.402 --> 19:41.588
And you have to go back, this is a system, but it was 
the development of, we paid for the first ones. the

19:42.665 --> 19:58.615
underwater beepers and bottom location, and 
above all, the unclassified little three-point

19:42.665 --> 19:58.615
station in the Pacific of Ewing's called the SOFAR 
system. Now, all those things you've listed have

19:58.635 --> 20:03.103
been primarily... measuring devices and devices 
attached to what I would call exploration of the

20:04.079 --> 20:09.725
seas. Do you see that the kind of work continuing in 
the future of oceanography, or do you think those

20:10.486 --> 20:19.136
devices were so effective that that sort of 
oceanography is ending? Well, I have a friend up in

20:21.758 --> 20:29.547
Cambridge who's working on an airborne altimeter 
using a laser beam. And they aren't satisfied

20:29.965 --> 20:35.053
until they get that kind of precision. So you think 
the precision measurements then will continue?

20:38.559 --> 20:44.348
The big problem in the whole thing is the 
condensation of data. You've got data running out

20:44.508 --> 20:53.543
of your ears now, some of it biased and some of it... 
I would like to see, at this time, when there is a

20:55.312 --> 21:19.024
little bit of a doldrum in research and people 
looking at the way they should go, a review of the

20:55.312 --> 21:19.024
Stratton Report and also a down to earth, maybe by 
the National Science Foundation or National

20:55.312 --> 21:19.024
Academy, some crowd like that, is to say, now, 
where do we stop taking data? and spend a couple of

21:19.257 --> 21:28.849
years and the money consolidating it until we have 
weaned out of it all we can get before we go into a new

21:19.257 --> 21:28.849
instrumentation program. At the same time, there 
has to be an ongoing project to apply to the oceans

21:29.911 --> 21:45.330
all of the marvelous developments in electronics 
that are going on and in the nuclear field that are

21:29.911 --> 21:45.330
going on so fast that the average oceanographer 
doesn't know what tools are available again. I

21:47.453 --> 21:49.095
don't know how to put that together. I should think 
it would be a function of NOAA.

21:56.716 --> 22:02.604
So you don't... Make sure I'm inferring this 
correctly, but you feel... I do not think that we

22:02.624 --> 22:16.243
should spend a lot of money on ships today 
surveying, continually getting additional

22:02.624 --> 22:16.243
data, until we have cooked what we have and gotten 
an essence out of it. Good, that's exactly what I

22:16.263 --> 22:17.545
want to know. What about the computer? You can't, 
it's got to be there. There's certain problems

22:21.797 --> 22:24.280
that you can't take the wave problem. Now, there's 
where your ivory tower comes in. I think Walter

22:30.167 --> 22:40.138
Monk's group on waves, I wish he'd stay with the 
waves instead of going out and earth wobbling and

22:30.167 --> 22:40.138
all that, but he's too big a man to tie down. But I'd 
like to see that thing worked out theoretically to

22:40.158 --> 22:48.968
the limit before we go out and take any more wave 
measurements.

22:51.243 --> 23:03.479
Now you could sell a great deal more of this if you 
would get a good tsunami prediction system that

22:51.243 --> 23:03.479
isn't dependent upon whether or not the 
lighthouse keeper gets drunk that night. I'd like

23:03.499 --> 23:10.669
to see a better, a better, a great deal, I'm 
delighted to see all this work on earthquake

23:03.499 --> 23:10.669
prediction. Because the public needs this. You 
can go along just so long before the democracy

23:13.192 --> 23:19.360
demands its pound of flesh.

23:21.854 --> 23:26.743
Now, only on this line, I have one more question. 
The use of glamour fields has sort of come and gone

23:27.124 --> 23:35.960
in the last several years in oceanography, you 
know, nuclear physics, physical oceanography.

23:36.662 --> 23:40.749
Some, of course, never came in, like marine 
biology and oceanography. What do you think will

23:41.130 --> 23:44.436
be the glamour field in oceanography in the 
future?

23:53.326 --> 24:00.938
Sometime we're going to have to pay the bill of all 
this advertising about what the oceans can do for

23:53.326 --> 24:00.938
humanity. And how are we going to do that with 77 
nations saying, get off my back?

24:09.171 --> 24:15.621
Somehow you've got to bring back the dream of the 
oceans as something useful to the man in the

24:09.171 --> 24:15.621
street. How are we doing, Paul? Good. Now, that's 
the last series of questions I want to ask you. I

24:21.980 --> 24:25.884
have four specific questions I want you to offer 
your opinion on. You don't have to pretend to be an

24:25.904 --> 24:28.226
expert on this. Aquaculture, are you optimistic? 
Yes, I am. I've been reading the Marine Letter of

24:33.611 --> 24:39.457
the Tri-State, Virginia, North and South 
Carolina. I believe that out of that is going to

24:39.637 --> 24:45.102
come something that will be commercial success. 
And certainly it'll be the only way of saving what

24:45.942 --> 24:48.505
we have got. Okay. In terms of aquaculture, do you 
think it'll produce anything but specialty foods

24:50.007 --> 24:57.155
like shellfish or crustaceans? Do you think 
it'll? No, I think it's going to have to be for the

24:59.117 --> 25:02.080
next 20 years. We're lucky if we get one line of mass 
production out of it. Okay. Do you see any hope for

25:07.466 --> 25:12.692
such things as plankton and kelp, for example, in 
mariculture? I was thinking mainly of my

25:14.528 --> 25:17.832
particular love of the marshes. No, I don't know 
anything about the deep sea. Okay. Secondly,

25:20.997 --> 25:25.923
mining the sea for minerals other than manganese 
and oil, I suppose. Are you optimistic about any of

25:26.804 --> 25:29.768
that in terms of being productive? Not except in 
special cases of sands and different types of...

25:31.951 --> 25:38.460
certain types of... chalks and things of that 
kind, where it is economically useful in the area

25:39.284 --> 25:44.514
where they do it. So for example, phosphates off 
North Carolina, you'd be optimistic about that,

25:45.496 --> 25:54.994
but not if it can bring the cost down where it's 
competitive, yes. Thirdly, the sea and

25:55.334 --> 25:58.440
pollution. this is a discussion now on most 
people, involving both nuclear waste and the

25:59.095 --> 26:08.407
alleged dying sea and so forth. Do you have any 
reaction to that? Yeah. It scared me at first, but I

26:11.831 --> 26:14.254
think I got over-scared. The same way that people 
got over-scared about automobile exhausts.

26:23.426 --> 26:27.972
I think it was Columbus, isn't it, once said that 
the human being is over 10 million years have been

26:28.880 --> 26:35.286
adapting to change after change after change, ice 
age and everything else conditions. I'm not going

26:35.967 --> 26:39.510
to be too frightened of having to adapt to others. I 
do think this, this is one area in which I think

26:41.813 --> 26:49.520
emphasis should be given. Just how close are we to a 
critical condition in the ocean? Is it all fear of

26:53.364 --> 26:57.368
people who love the ocean and Or is it a physical 
fact? It's like the ozone layer. Let's get the fact

27:01.500 --> 27:03.122
on the thing. Well, do you think that publicists in 
opposition to pollution, people who are not

27:05.765 --> 27:22.285
really scientists, for example, like Jacques 
Cousteau, do you think they are a positive good or

27:05.765 --> 27:22.285
moderately positive good, or do they hurt the 
cause of acquiring the facts? Well, as Rosamund

27:22.305 --> 27:25.268
said, never mind what they say about me. Every time 
they publish my name, it helps. Yeah. Well, those

27:27.723 --> 27:32.290
are not against us as far as I'm focused on. I think 
his lectures and his movies have done more to bring

27:32.730 --> 27:40.241
people back to a knowledge of what's really in the 
sea. I think his educational programs are fine. Of

27:43.406 --> 27:44.788
course, he's a master showman. Why shouldn't they 
be? I'm for him. You have no other. You have NATO,

27:48.293 --> 27:56.886
for instance, in the other area is pretty well 
damned by the man who has to buy an exhaust control.

27:57.507 --> 28:04.513
Who else is speaking for this on an international 
worldwide basis any better? And that leads to my

28:04.533 --> 28:07.596
last question in an international worldwide way. 
What is your opinion on the rising political

28:09.618 --> 28:13.321
problems in oceanography? 200-mile limits, 
international conferences that are occurring

28:13.341 --> 28:16.504
now. Do you think that threatens the academic 
discipline? Yes, I think it threatens the

28:20.808 --> 28:25.232
untrammeled collection of information. In other 
words, In the old days, Ewing could send a vessel

28:26.701 --> 28:31.528
off the coast to any coast he wanted to and take his 
seismic reading. Now he's got to go through a lot of

28:31.548 --> 28:33.030
red tape. It's going to be more difficult. If it's 
handled correctly, well, if it can be handled

28:35.494 --> 28:44.688
where the national business...

28:44.708 --> 28:45.209
I'm torn. I'm torn between the one world of 
scientific control and my complete fear of

28:45.750 --> 28:53.121
dictatorship.

28:53.141 --> 28:54.042
I think perhaps... Hayek, whatever his name is, 
has it better, that the untrammeled minds of free

28:55.186 --> 29:09.386
men working together, even from a selfish basis, 
can do more and will be better for humanity than any

28:55.186 --> 29:09.386
controlled oligarchy dictatorship on the thing.

29:13.632 --> 29:21.963
The Law of the Sea Conference is a perfect mirror of 
the old international situation, I think. At the

29:22.644 --> 29:23.826
present time, I'm a nationalist. I don't believe 
that we should necessarily subsidize the man

29:26.817 --> 29:33.083
who's going to go out and make a profit mining the 
ocean. We should know what his interests are,

29:34.845 --> 29:44.875
though, and protect them to the extent that we can, 
and perhaps even to our advantage. But I would like

29:45.476 --> 29:51.822
to see absolutely free research if the 
information is given to the other countries.

29:52.325 --> 29:57.455
without the necessity of having to go through all 
kind of customs of having people on board and that

29:52.325 --> 29:57.455
sort of business.

30:01.462 --> 30:09.477
Okay, now, would you list in the major items that 
you think of importance very quickly before? The

30:09.497 --> 30:12.443
first was the writing of the oceans by...
