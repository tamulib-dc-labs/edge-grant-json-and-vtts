WEBVTT

00:01.853 --> 00:05.759
Second, let's see if we've got anything on that. 
We're here today to try to get what I have in

00:07.061 --> 00:14.351
background information in my 18 years with the 
association. Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and turn

00:15.152 --> 00:21.862
it on. We're trying what I really would like to talk 
to you about. Well, anyway, that was the way the

00:23.504 --> 00:25.988
book is going to develop. with the county agent, 
animal husbandry problem, and probably deal a lot

00:26.609 --> 00:37.106
with, I noticed in the literature over there, the 
quacks or whatever they want to call them. Been

00:37.126 --> 00:39.133
through all the files. thing. So that brings us up 
to about World War II. And then I think the next

00:43.837 --> 00:54.931
chapter is going to deal probably just with the 
concept of urbanization, modern contemporary

00:43.837 --> 00:54.931
developments, and so forth, changing profile of 
the profession. Somewhere along there, and I

00:56.052 --> 01:06.946
don't know quite what chapter it's going to fall 
into, will be new technology and techniques and

00:56.052 --> 01:06.946
problems within the profession, women coming in. 
All of this is going to go somewhere. And then you

01:08.948 --> 01:22.215
probably got your TVMA newsletter and there's an 
insert going out in that thing to all the vets

01:08.948 --> 01:22.215
asking them to send in any information or 
experiences or something and so we're going to try

01:22.668 --> 01:50.346
to run about two chapters which will really be a 
personality profile I think it'd be fun you know

01:22.668 --> 01:50.346
because everybody has a good story sure so what and 
what I'd like to talk to you about you tell me too

01:22.668 --> 01:50.346
because I'm getting my feet wet but one thing I want 
to know is simply your personal background and how

01:22.668 --> 01:50.346
you got in associated with the Texas Veterinary 
Medical Association Then maybe some sort of broad

01:51.237 --> 02:01.087
comment about what you think is historically 
important in doing a study like this or a book. What

02:01.167 --> 02:02.669
do you think people need to know? And then maybe get 
into, you might say, some specific information

02:02.709 --> 02:12.719
regarding your tenure as director. One theme I 
want to try to pursue throughout all this thing I

02:18.305 --> 02:21.429
don't know quite how we're going to define it yet, 
but the human-animal bond. This has always been

02:21.489 --> 02:23.451
with us as part of life. And here is how we handled it 
in early Texas and modern Texas and so forth. And

02:30.760 --> 02:31.962
it's still very much with us. So there's going to be

02:32.222 --> 02:41.133
a caring theme, I hope, that will come out of all 
this. That's very, very good. So tell me where you

02:42.790 --> 02:45.152
got started. Well, I got started, of course, I have 
an agricultural background as far as education.

02:50.957 --> 02:52.058
From A&M? From Texas A&M. I'm a 1954 graduate of 
Texas A&M, and I got a degree in agricultural

02:53.119 --> 02:59.805
education, as a matter of fact. And, of course, I 
had an agricultural background being reared on a

02:59.826 --> 03:06.432
farm and kind of a diversified farm and ranch. My 
daddy had eight children, so he did everything in

03:06.452 --> 03:12.477
agriculture from trade cattle to farm peanuts, 
cotton, grew hogs and horses and so forth. Where

03:17.722 --> 03:18.805
were you? Houston County, Texas, which is a little 
town called Grape Land, Texas. Where I went to high

03:22.914 --> 03:28.006
school, I grew up about four and a half miles out of 
the country. South of Jasper? Where is Grape Land?

03:29.610 --> 03:31.815
Grape Land is in Houston County, north of 
Crockett. South of Palestine. It's just across

03:33.321 --> 03:34.782
the Trinity River. You know, East Texas begins and 
ends at the Trinity River. At least in that part of

03:38.327 --> 03:41.591
the state. And I grew up on a small, diversified 
farm. I grew up on a small farm, several hundred

03:44.635 --> 03:49.641
acre farm, but we did all the small things in 
agriculture. We weren't big operators. And the

03:51.303 --> 03:52.805
county agent was an important man. Oh, 
absolutely. And so was the ag teacher. Probably in

03:54.968 --> 03:59.934
my community, the ag culture teacher was the most 
prominent person in agriculture. He did some of

03:59.954 --> 04:00.975
this old They looked to the ag teacher to be the 
authority that knew more than the producer did. Of

04:09.376 --> 04:18.330
course, the county agent was too, but in fact, my 
greatest influence to do what I did was to call in my

04:09.376 --> 04:18.330
vocational agriculture teacher. His name was 
J.C. Schultz, and he was an old pioneer. And he

04:22.397 --> 04:27.385
encouraged me because he wanted me to be a teacher 
like he was. into vocational agriculture and

04:27.702 --> 04:37.015
future farmer work and I became a public speaker 
for the chapter. In fact, I won second in the state

04:37.496 --> 04:43.465
public speaking contest in 1947. That's a long way 
back. I was only about 14, 15 years old. But then, of

04:48.211 --> 04:56.443
course, I was never anything that I was going to do 
except be a vocational agriculture teacher

04:48.211 --> 04:56.443
because that's That was my motivation, and I went 
to Texas A&M and graduated in 1954 with a degree in

04:57.065 --> 05:04.134
ag education. At that time, the Korean War was on, 
and all the older guys that had already graduated

05:04.154 --> 05:13.406
two or three years ago were coming back from the 
war. So it made it pretty hard for a young man 22

05:14.587 --> 05:19.794
years old to get a job in teaching. So Extension was 
doing some expansion in those days. So I went into

05:23.238 --> 05:26.903
Extension, and I was in county agricultural work. 
in Anderson County in Palestine as an assistant,

05:27.710 --> 05:40.707
and then I was an associate agent in Panola County, 
which was working with adult farm and ranch

05:27.710 --> 05:40.707
people. At that time... My dad was an old county 
agent. Oh, really? Yeah, he was in Plaquemine

05:45.378 --> 05:49.123
Parish, Louisiana in the 1920s and early 30s. 
Another world. He had a lot of stories, didn't he?

05:52.527 --> 05:53.087
Yes, he did. But anyway, I got involved in farm 
organization work. The Texas Farm Bureau was

05:57.693 --> 06:01.197
beginning to expand into East Texas. They had 
never really had any members in East Texas. And

06:04.514 --> 06:09.441
they were beginning to expand their membership 
over there, and it was a very slow proposition. I

06:09.501 --> 06:22.900
got very interested in farm organization work, 
and about that time they offered me an opportunity

06:09.501 --> 06:22.900
to become a field representative for the Texas 
Farm Bureau, which would be organizing and

06:09.501 --> 06:22.900
working with county farm bureaus. And the only 
locations they had were one in Austin and one in

06:23.621 --> 06:27.467
Lubbock. I didn't have much trouble with that, so I 
came to Austin. Eventually, I moved to Taylor and

06:33.093 --> 06:35.936
then came to Austin. And as it would work out, they 
asked me if I'd work in the legislative office

06:35.956 --> 06:48.271
during the session to help out the legislative 
director because they needed somebody to come in

06:35.956 --> 06:48.271
and help. So I got very, very interested in 
government repairs and legislative work. And

06:55.319 --> 06:57.842
back to the point, I was just fascinated with it. 
So, anyway, I told them that I wanted to go back. I

07:01.010 --> 07:05.814
didn't know how I was doing that work, but I wanted 
to go back to the field and if it worked out fine. If

07:05.874 --> 07:08.136
it didn't, I still, but I enjoy it and I like it. So, 
as luck would have it, the person that I worked with

07:08.157 --> 07:17.785
at the legislative office at Farm Bureau decided 
to take another job in the Valley, running another

07:08.157 --> 07:17.785
organization. And at that time, I pretty much 
settled out that I was going to stay where I was. But

07:22.950 --> 07:25.973
then, to make a long story short, they influenced 
me to come back. to take the legislative office

07:26.290 --> 07:29.193
over. I was 29 years old. That's a nice job. And I was 
a little scared to death, but I think that's what

07:32.656 --> 07:40.803
made me succeed, because I knew that I had a pretty 
big responsibility. And I stayed with them for two

07:40.823 --> 07:50.931
sessions, a 63

07:40.823 --> 07:50.931
and 65 session, 1963 and 1965. And that's when my 
acquaintance struck up with the Veterinary

07:51.712 --> 07:56.196
Medical Association. That time, 1962, was the 
first year that Texas passed a sales tax. It was a 2%

08:03.877 --> 08:06.439
limited sales tax. Well, there was a big push on to 
exempt certain items, including food and drugs.

08:14.287 --> 08:27.060
Well, it turned out that veterinary drugs did not 
meet the definition of drugs

08:14.287 --> 08:27.060
that they were going to exempt.

08:28.171 --> 08:34.059
The executive director at that time was Glenn 
Savage, who you'll run across somewhere in the

08:28.171 --> 08:34.059
history of this organization. And he was down here 
from Fort Worth where the office was at that time.

08:38.626 --> 08:54.668
And I was with the Farm Bureau, and he asked me if I 
would help him try to secure an exemption for

08:38.626 --> 08:54.668
veterinary drugs, because the definition of 
drugs was for, was human drugs, for a practitioner

08:38.626 --> 08:54.668
of the healing arts. The definition didn't fit the 
veterinarian. The veterinarian at that time, and

08:57.220 --> 09:07.873
I don't know where they are yet, was not described 
as a practitioner of the healing arts, so that's

08:57.220 --> 09:07.873
the way the exemption read in the tax bill in 1962. 
So they asked me, and at that time it was a big fight

09:08.674 --> 09:13.800
to not take any amendments on the floor. Everybody 
agreed that we were going to have a tax bill, but

09:14.240 --> 09:20.087
they took one amendment and were afraid to destroy 
the bill. So they asked me, and I said, well, I think

09:20.688 --> 09:24.452
the only chance we've got is to go to the 
comptroller's office and see if he would make an

09:24.820 --> 09:36.820
interpretation, if he on his own would make an 
interpretation that veterinary drug did indeed

09:24.820 --> 09:36.820
fit the exemption. So we got a comptroller's 
ruling on that for that session. And that was the

09:41.528 --> 09:45.734
beginning of my, even my knowledge of the 
association. And that was their big, that was

09:46.576 --> 09:50.963
their big bag in 1962. So you did get that 
interpretation from the Comptroller? We did get

09:53.909 --> 09:54.469
it. And then that stuck basically there? Yeah, 
what we did later, of course, was write it. We did

09:57.993 --> 10:05.161
get a rewrite of the bill, but at that time, as I 
said, we could have... Nobody was really... I

10:05.181 --> 10:09.906
think we could have gotten it, but the deal was made 
that we weren't going to change the tax bill. So

10:10.106 --> 10:11.287
that means we left out. When you left out, you're 
always left out. Chances are. So anyway... We got

10:17.032 --> 10:24.064
that done, and then, of course, they were very nice 
to me and appreciated it. And, of course, it was in

10:24.085 --> 10:30.416
my interest, too, but I represented people who had 
cattle, you know, and kind of worked together. So

10:31.057 --> 10:37.909
anyhow, about in the 1965 session, we came back and 
rewrote the tax bill to make it clear. other than

10:38.429 --> 10:46.821
just the comptroller's ruling that the 
veterinary drug indeed was exempt, along with

10:38.429 --> 10:46.821
other prescription drugs. It had to be a 
prescription drug. And so, anyway, about old July

10:49.185 --> 11:06.630
of 1965, Glenn Savage, the executive secretary at 
that time they called him, called me up and wanted

10:49.185 --> 11:06.630
to know if I wanted to be considered for the 
executive secretary of the Texas Veterinary

10:49.185 --> 11:06.630
Medicine Association. I told them I did not 
because I had a job and I wasn't looking for one. And

11:10.784 --> 11:15.349
they said, well, would you just agree to interview 
with the committee? And they had put this thing in

11:16.270 --> 11:19.233
the Wall Street Journal. You can't believe how 
many hundreds of applications they had even then.

11:24.639 --> 11:30.865
But they weeded it down to about, I don't know, 20 or 
so, and I agreed to come. And like a lot of things

11:30.885 --> 11:34.609
happen, I did agree to... to accept their offer 
which really was a substantial raise for me at that

11:35.635 --> 12:04.073
time and I had to make a decision and I did and I never 
regretted it because I made a lot of friends and I

11:35.635 --> 12:04.073
was really didn't know it at the time but I was 
taking on a developing organization I was taking

11:35.635 --> 12:04.073
on a developing organization

11:35.635 --> 12:04.073
that really was fixing to get into its own. In other 
words, it had come to the point in 1965, they were at

12:08.329 --> 12:15.880
the place where the growth could really occur. In 
other words, if certain things were plugged in,

12:16.541 --> 12:23.231
and fortunately we were able to do that, that the 
growth was going to be there. We called it a very

12:23.351 --> 12:28.238
progressive era that we were in. veterinarians 
were beginning to be more accepted, the

12:28.910 --> 12:43.162
sophistication of small animal practice, the 
growth of cities, and the fact that the

12:28.910 --> 12:43.162
veterinarian in the country was taking on a 
different and better image. And we were getting

12:44.003 --> 12:47.906
more quality trained, smart people out in the 
field. We were getting somebody that was above the

12:47.926 --> 12:58.275
average agricultural type person that might wind 
up in ag ed or or animal husbandry. We were getting a

13:00.087 --> 13:04.673
real the real sharp kids coming in. So I had just a 
good time. And I had had enough experience, I guess

13:07.076 --> 13:15.086
that organization that I knew some things that had 
to be done. In other words, you had to start doing

13:15.106 --> 13:22.255
some new things, some things that were not being 
done just when I came Henry We pretty much

13:22.910 --> 13:26.914
concentrated, it was a one-man office, one 
secretary office. It was in Fort Worth. I went up

13:28.656 --> 13:33.261
and personally moved it down myself with the help 
of a trucker. And that was one of the

13:34.362 --> 13:42.911
considerations that I made, that I would not be 
interested in the job if I hadn't moved to Fort

13:34.362 --> 13:42.911
Worth. Okay, that's what I'm wondering. So that 
was part of the deal. That was part of the deal that I

13:45.394 --> 13:49.558
struck, and I really cut across a lot of... a lot of 
emotions when we did this because the office had

13:49.808 --> 13:53.131
always been there. The treasurer had been 
treasurer for, Dr. Cloud had been treasurer for

13:57.035 --> 14:03.121
many, many years, very much respected, and that 
meant that he would no longer be treasurer. Who was

14:03.482 --> 14:03.982
that? Dr. Cloud. I believe it was E.G. Cloud. I saw 
that literature. He was a very, very great man. I

14:12.731 --> 14:16.995
think he was a graduate of the old Kansas City 
Veterinary College. And at that time, he was in his

14:17.015 --> 14:19.157
70s, and Of course, he seemed like a very, very old 
person to me. Of course, it doesn't seem like he's

14:22.411 --> 14:25.193
quite that old anymore at that age. But a very nice 
person. But I was the person that, and with Dr.

14:27.015 --> 14:32.621
Wallace Cardwell was president then. Dr. 
Cardwell said, I'll take care of it. I'll talk to

14:34.642 --> 14:35.243
Dr. Cloud. And I'll talk to the Fort Worth 
veterinarians. And I will clear the air for you.

14:42.030 --> 14:44.772
And the board has agreed to go along with what I 
recommend. And that won't be your problem. And I

14:46.834 --> 14:48.756
said, Bill. That's the deal. So anyway, to tell you 
the story and short it down, I went up and visited

14:50.304 --> 14:56.013
Dr. Plow. We went over to the bank, got all the 
records.

15:03.505 --> 15:05.267
If you need to stop and do something else, go ahead. 
No, no, no. I've got the next phone call. I've got a

15:10.175 --> 15:12.519
bill I'm trying to get introduced today. It's the 
last day to introduce it, so it's been hanging in

15:12.539 --> 15:16.465
the senator's office over there. That's an 
orange. Yeah, it's going. Go ahead. Where would

15:20.679 --> 15:22.581
you like for me to pick that up? Go ahead. You're 
moving from Fort Worth to Austin. Right. And where

15:25.464 --> 15:27.365
did you locate in Austin? Well, that's an 
interesting story. I guess that's not important.

15:29.787 --> 15:30.468
That's an interesting story. I'd always office 
downtown because at that time I was still a fairly

15:30.568 --> 15:34.251
young person. I was 33 years old at that time. And I 
was assuming that they'd say, well, let's move

15:36.493 --> 15:40.937
back to downtown. But I think they felt that the 
change of me moving to the suburbs, which... could

15:46.398 --> 15:53.566
hardly be called a suburb now without Hancock's 
Shopping Center, which is out on Interstate 35

15:46.398 --> 15:53.566
north. You'll see a Sears store out there. But 
anyway, they had a small office building out

15:55.929 --> 15:58.672
there. So we negotiated for a very small space, 
three little offices in it, reception room, kind

15:59.513 --> 16:10.185
of a work area, storage area, and then my office in 
that. And I think they thought it would be good for

16:10.206 --> 16:14.110
me to get away from my... the influence of 
agriculture and the people that were around there

16:14.360 --> 16:23.995
thought maybe change would be good to get me 
thinking maybe more veterinary matters away from

16:14.360 --> 16:23.995
the old. And I accepted that, and that certainly 
wasn't a consideration in me coming to work. We

16:30.925 --> 16:37.435
stayed out there for two years and tried to 
renegotiate a contract. And it turned out that

16:37.455 --> 16:41.802
Sears owned that building, Homework 
Corporation. And they gave us some very, very

16:42.558 --> 16:48.426
stringent terms that we couldn't afford. We were 
still struggling. When we started, we had a

16:51.189 --> 16:55.996
$25,000 budget.

16:56.356 --> 16:57.678
I've got some notes on that. I think it was, I know it 
was less than $30,000, but something like a

16:57.698 --> 17:03.386
$25,000 annual budget. We had only about between 
600 and 700 members. So at that time, we were only

17:05.889 --> 17:09.814
getting, I believe, $25 or head for members so you 
can figure out the budget pretty quick. Anyway, we

17:15.756 --> 17:18.659
decided then to move back downtown. We moved down 
on Browder Street and stayed there for three or

17:18.679 --> 17:38.502
four years and that building was leased to the 
state and we moved over to 6th and Congress, which

17:18.679 --> 17:38.502
is called the Scarborough Building, and we began 
to try to expand the size of our offices and add to

17:18.679 --> 17:38.502
our staff at that time. because we were adding 
programs all this time. We were adding new things.

17:43.697 --> 18:02.834
When I first came, it was the convention, it was 
membership, it was editing the Texas Veterinary

17:43.697 --> 18:02.834
Medical Journal, and it was a summer seminar, and 
maybe one or two specialized seminars at other

17:43.697 --> 18:02.834
times during the year. But it really was the base of 
the activity. Say that again. So TVMA convention,

18:08.266 --> 18:15.538
summer seminars,

18:08.266 --> 18:15.538
the journal, the TVMA journal. Right, 
convention, membership, of course, retention

18:15.819 --> 18:22.851
and development.

18:22.911 --> 18:29.862
Journal editing, which was a six-time-a-year 
publication that came out every month, which

18:22.911 --> 18:29.862
still does, I guess. And... ready to continue 
education program convention at the convention

18:32.245 --> 18:59.282
both continuing education and the business 
meeting type of situation and then we would have a

18:32.245 --> 18:59.282
summer seminar which was our semi-annual meeting 
more or less where the boards got together and then

18:32.245 --> 18:59.282
we would put on a maybe special seminar too for say 
the dairy practitioner or the small animal

18:32.245 --> 18:59.282
practitioner this was before the local 
associations developed strongly before they

18:32.245 --> 18:59.282
could put on their own seminars They were 
beginning to develop what I call the local

18:59.785 --> 19:03.990
association like Harris County. Was that going on 
before you came in? There were some local

19:06.072 --> 19:09.696
associations then. Had that been basically 
sponsored by the Texas? No, it was more... Or was

19:12.400 --> 19:15.804
that just a local spontaneous type... Right, we 
were supportive of it and the association had been

19:15.824 --> 19:18.647
supportive. But it was pretty much a social event 
for the local people to stay together and to talk.

19:24.490 --> 19:29.497
more talk about problems, and then later on they 
got on into continuing education. I want to come

19:29.877 --> 19:35.224
back to that a little bit and talk about the 
relations between the local association and the

19:29.877 --> 19:35.224
state. Excuse me, go ahead. So when I came, as I say, 
we were beginning to expand. At that time, I had

19:43.034 --> 19:51.966
seen the fact that we had to get... One reason they 
hired me, of course, is that they knew I knew

19:43.034 --> 19:51.966
something about the legislative process. and 
they knew that they would never ever be completely

19:52.486 --> 20:13.870
free of the legislative process because of the 
practice act and because of other things like tax

19:52.486 --> 20:13.870
taxes and things that affect veterinarians in the 
legislative process and of course I've had enough

19:52.486 --> 20:13.870
of an association background to I guess to get a 
little credibility on that side so But I began to

20:14.069 --> 20:21.700
see... Had Savage or any of your predecessors 
actively really been involved with the

20:14.069 --> 20:21.700
legislature? They always hired somebody. They 
hired a lobbyist, kind of like I am now, to come in

20:24.423 --> 20:30.973
and handle certain bills and certain defensive 
measures. Savage didn't know anything about

20:31.313 --> 20:36.120
legislation and didn't want to. That was not his 
bag, and that was acceptable. But he knew that it

20:39.164 --> 20:42.068
had to be done, so he hired... people on the spot. 
Okay, so your retention was with full knowledge

20:43.990 --> 20:49.837
that this is what we need to do. We need to focus in 
this direction. Right. It was a very strong point.

20:53.701 --> 21:03.513
And, of course, I knew that, and I still believe 
this, that all associations, you've got to have an

20:53.701 --> 21:03.513
association manager first, and you've got to have 
a lobbyist second. I mean, that may sound like I'm

21:03.533 --> 21:07.077
talking against my profession, but The 
management association legislation is just one

21:07.546 --> 21:10.730
part of it. It's very, very important. And it's 
real good that you get somebody that's what we call

21:12.513 --> 21:20.003
a double-deed that can do association management 
and legislation. And of course, I had a keen

21:20.123 --> 21:24.429
interest in the legislation, and I wanted to do it. 
But it's very, very time-consuming to be both. It

21:28.154 --> 21:29.495
takes away from time. So you have to have a very good 
number two person in the office sometimes to try to

21:29.515 --> 21:35.123
do both. I always did. I never spent a dollar on a 
lobbyist for an association. I never spent any

21:41.089 --> 21:44.013
money on an attorney. I did the whole thing. But we 
hired a CPA to be our auditor of our books like

21:46.176 --> 21:50.742
always. Did you hire an assistant director or 
anything? I hired a real good number one girl

21:57.111 --> 22:02.038
Friday night. It took me two or three people to find 
that girl. But she was from a military family and

22:05.427 --> 22:13.035
needed a job and was very intelligent and had a lot 
of experience in typing. And I later made her

22:13.055 --> 22:17.980
office manager and started personnel. Who was 
that man? Her name was Virginia Houghton,

22:19.161 --> 22:24.066
H-O-U-G-H-T-O-N. Everybody called her Jenny. 
She was an Iowa girl, an Iowa boy in the Air Force.

22:29.832 --> 22:33.836
Found out at Berkshire, here in Austin. And... 
She's very, very loyal, very supportive to me over

22:35.532 --> 22:42.740
those years and pretty much ran the office. And I 
can say for years, Henry, there was not anybody but

22:43.540 --> 22:48.325
Jenny. We did it all. And I can say we're beginning 
to see the need to expand into new areas. For

22:57.695 --> 23:04.122
instance, I set up a political action committee 
called VPAT, Veterans Political Action

22:57.695 --> 23:04.122
Committee. I set that up to try to get the 
veterinarians involved in the financial end of

23:04.844 --> 23:11.972
legislation. You know, the story is that you can't 
play the legislative game unless you play in the

23:11.992 --> 23:19.720
political game. Yeah. So I was trying to promote 
that and did, and we began to raise a little money to

23:20.941 --> 23:31.993
help certain people that had helped us, you know, 
pass bills and kill things. Yeah. I can't remember

23:32.975 --> 23:36.045
the year, but you'll find it in the history of the 
organization. We set it up prior to 1970,

23:36.085 --> 23:43.930
somewhere between 1965 and 1970, we set up the 
Veterinary Political Action Committee. The idea

23:44.433 --> 23:47.878
being that you would make an extra dollar 
contribution. We never did say it had to be $50. We

23:49.600 --> 23:52.744
never did refuse to accept any amount. But it was 
kind of a volunteer assessment, not an

23:52.765 --> 23:58.773
assessment, but a request on the membership. It 
didn't come out on the membership. It was just an

24:00.575 --> 24:07.945
appeal that we made every so often to give to the... 
As you would any political action committee any

24:00.575 --> 24:07.945
time. And it had to be personal contributions. 
Right, yeah. That made it a little tougher, but...

24:13.947 --> 24:17.431
We had an influence of enough people to get it 
started. Most of them are board members, past

24:17.551 --> 24:24.360
presidents, officers, or those that were real 
active in the local association. Is that still

24:24.480 --> 24:26.082
going? They still have it running. I think they've 
been able to raise pretty good money lately. Their

24:32.429 --> 24:41.220
practice act was up last session before the 
sunset, and they needed some friends, and they

24:32.429 --> 24:41.220
needed radical action to So we set that up. Really, 
I did that for two reasons. One was to try to... Did

24:44.730 --> 24:47.414
you work for them on that incident? All around it. 
All around it? You mean the BPAC? Yeah, no, I mean

24:50.238 --> 24:51.580
now. I mean the last session of the legislature. I 
worked around and with them. That's kind of

24:56.868 --> 24:58.210
another story. Okay, I want to ask you that. The 
agricultural groups were... or a little bit

25:00.623 --> 25:06.612
concerned about some of the things, then they were 
putting me in a very tough position. Anyway, I was

25:06.692 --> 25:08.735
able to do some things. But anyway, we set that up, 
and it became apparent that still we needed some

25:09.316 --> 25:16.267
other things. At that time, the late 60s, there was 
a big push on to require mandatory continuing

25:16.387 --> 25:28.606
education for professionals.

25:28.626 --> 25:29.567
And we were scared to death. As a matter of fact, we 
didn't know how to get a handle on it. But there was a

25:31.813 --> 25:39.002
lot of pressure coming down from the federal 
people to require mandatory continuing

25:31.813 --> 25:39.002
education. So we set up the Texas Academy of 
Veterinary Practice, Texas Academy of

25:39.022 --> 25:46.371
Veterinary Practice. OK, my next question. Yeah, 
it sounded like it. TABP, Texas Academy of

25:48.614 --> 25:54.061
Veterinary Practice, which Billy Tremere from 
San Antonio was the first president. And Billy

25:54.722 --> 25:56.905
asked me when he came in, he said, I want to do 
something. I was sending him a blank. The Texas

26:01.085 --> 26:04.751
Academy of Veterinary Practice. Texas Academy of 
Veterinary Practice. He said, what is the most

26:07.475 --> 26:10.058
needed thing we need to do? We've been in 
legislation. We've broadened our continuing

26:11.701 --> 26:13.904
education program. What do we need to do? This 
thing scares me about mandatory CE. What can we do?

26:21.295 --> 26:27.364
I said, I think what the professionals need to do, 
the veterinarians, is to establish some image

26:28.238 --> 26:31.101
that we're already doing a lot voluntarily. And I 
said, you know, the physicians have what they call

26:31.121 --> 26:37.609
an academy of physicians. These are the people 
that go a step beyond. And I said, I'm not talking

26:39.631 --> 26:48.781
about, you know, getting into the issuing of some 
certificate for some school that you're going to a

26:39.631 --> 26:48.781
lot of advanced things. We're talking about 
practical things that practitioners

26:48.881 --> 26:54.568
do. And he said, well, let's look into that. So we 
talked to some people, including the Texas

26:56.217 --> 27:24.908
Medical Association and the Texas Academy of 
Medicine and some of those, and he said, why don't

26:56.217 --> 27:24.908
we look at the possibility of setting up an academy 
where we've set some standards where you have to

26:56.217 --> 27:24.908
have so many hours of continuing education before 
you can belong to the academy, and you have to keep

26:56.217 --> 27:24.908
so many hours up so you can maintain your 
membership, and that way we can demonstrate not

26:56.217 --> 27:24.908
only to the regulators but to the public. that we 
already you know we didn't we didn't leave school

27:25.563 --> 27:50.693
and forget learning you know we we left the school 
and we're continuing so we set that up in 1970 that

27:25.563 --> 27:50.693
was five years after i got there i guess that was the 
second outside second other group that we blended

27:25.563 --> 27:50.693
in and we're very careful that all of these are all 
all these things are under the umbrella of tbma

27:25.563 --> 27:50.693
they were never Yeah, because you would create a 
monster there, couldn't you? Oh, yeah. And it

27:53.785 --> 27:55.867
still is that way. You can't be an academy if you're 
not a TVA. You have to be the way the bylaws were

27:58.790 --> 28:03.094
drawn, and I'm sure they're going to change a 
little bit. So we set that up, and then we began to

28:04.516 --> 28:15.367
get more deeply involved in stepping up our 
activity and continuing education. At that time,

28:15.387 --> 28:20.292
insurance was another thing that began to surface 
as being a need. And everybody in the association

28:21.048 --> 28:26.716
business that was in the insurance business made 
money, unlike today. You know, there's just

28:27.237 --> 28:30.562
plenty of people that don't want to be in the 
insurance business and shouldn't be. And I got

28:30.602 --> 28:32.404
into the association. I would warn them to be 
careful about getting into the insurance. But we

28:36.350 --> 28:46.104
got into the insurance business, set up our own 
hospital program, our own life insurance thing,

28:36.350 --> 28:46.104
you know, through companies. We sponsored them, 
by the way. So it's a group insurance for all

28:47.828 --> 28:56.501
purposes, medical, for liability, disability. 
Workers' comp, set up the whole gauntlet of a

28:57.223 --> 29:02.070
general insurance coverage. That's when we 
really hired our third person, our next member of

29:02.110 --> 29:11.625
the staff, named Claire Trautman, 
T-R-O-U-T-M-A, Claire again. for some reason had

29:12.010 --> 29:13.933
a military background, too. Her husband was in the 
military and they retired here. Spell that again,

29:16.217 --> 29:17.579
Clara. Clara, C-L-A-R-E-T-R-O-U-T-M-A-N, 
Troutman. And we hired her to administer the

29:22.246 --> 29:37.090
insurance program in cooperation with our 
sponsor, the insurance

29:22.246 --> 29:37.090
organization of the company that we represented 
for us. And in addition, that gave us another staff

29:37.930 --> 29:42.358
member to help on other things. She wasn't hired 
exclusively for the purpose, but it gave us

29:42.378 --> 29:51.814
another person to work in convention work, 
another hand, another person to put out work. But

29:53.838 --> 30:01.812
that lasted, it went down with the story of the 
insurance, business in general, it just got

30:02.332 --> 30:04.495
horrible. We did another thing too to raise money. 
We were looking for supplemental income. We were

30:08.821 --> 30:11.585
trying to keep them raising dues. Okay, so you were 
taking kind of a fee on the policies. We were taking

30:14.249 --> 30:25.766
a commission out of the company, the sponsoring 
agency that we worked with was giving us a

30:14.249 --> 30:25.766
percentage of the premium that was paid in. Did you 
sell your policy to different carriers or...

30:30.715 --> 30:31.236
Right. What we did, we got an agency out of Fort 
Worth to set it up. And he was in complete control of

30:36.985 --> 30:39.689
finding the source. The only heat we put on him was 
that it had to be competitive. AVMA also had an

30:47.401 --> 30:49.324
insurance program. And some of our members are 
already in AVMA. But I have to be honest, we did

30:52.108 --> 30:53.871
it... Two reasons. One is to get some extra income. 
Two was to get some extra staff. I mean, I'm talking

30:59.166 --> 31:00.467
like a manager now. Yeah, sure. I don't know 
whether the board saw it that way completely, but

31:01.108 --> 31:05.252
at least they supported it. Well, it should have 
been a benefit to the members, too. It was a member

31:09.736 --> 31:14.521
service, and that's another thing we were getting 
to stress was member services. You know, we

31:14.681 --> 31:22.609
stressed CE, we stressed political action, we 
stressed the academy through CE, CE through the

31:14.681 --> 31:22.609
academy. And we began to get more involved in 
member services. At that point, we began to put in a

31:26.375 --> 31:36.487
few products that large animal practices could 
use, like vials and needles for brucellosis

31:26.375 --> 31:36.487
testing. We were the source of that. You know, they 
could only get the federal program testing for

31:38.349 --> 31:42.593
brucellosis. And I don't know how many years I was a 
disease brucellosis because it was contagious

31:42.794 --> 31:47.759
abortion. And federal people had a program that 
went through the state animal health commission

31:53.403 --> 31:59.071
practitioner was authorized to do all the health 
testing and blood testing. But they would not

31:59.091 --> 32:03.557
release the materials to just anybody. They 
wanted them to go through an agency type

32:04.118 --> 32:08.625
situation, either through the government or 
through us. So we convinced them to go through the

32:08.805 --> 32:12.730
association. And that gave us another small 
source of income. And let me ask you this. think

32:19.643 --> 32:24.771
about or try to develop this into a broader 
cooperative type of supply? No, we didn't. We

32:25.913 --> 32:27.094
thought about it some. Because that's a danger. 
Yeah, we ran into too many potential conflicts.

32:31.081 --> 32:35.608
You know, the veterinarian likes to and should do 
business in his community. So we didn't go into the

32:35.628 --> 32:37.771
cooperative. We didn't go into trying to sell him 
all of his needs for his hospital. So this is a

32:41.917 --> 32:45.763
specialty product that's really controlled 
basically through that. The only one that we were

32:46.484 --> 32:48.267
really into. We did have some pamphlets that we 
made available. They'd been into that before I

32:51.186 --> 32:55.931
came, some pamphlets on client pamphlets. We were 
into that somewhat.

33:01.276 --> 33:04.640
But that gave us some more incomes, another 
source. And by that time, we were beginning to need

33:05.321 --> 33:12.028
some more staff. We began to hire more 
clerical-type staff, people that could get in.

33:18.520 --> 33:19.281
turnout work. We had three people, myself, Jenny, 
and Claire, that were pretty much the upper level

33:19.321 --> 33:25.490
staff. Then we began to hire support people, in 
which when I left, before I left, there'd be nine,

33:25.610 --> 33:42.233
we had nine people there, including we hired a 
publications person, that person to do our

33:25.610 --> 33:42.233
printing, to lay out our publications. See, I did 
all that myself. I laid out the publication. I

33:46.986 --> 33:48.228
wrote the publication. I laid it down. I did 
everything except printing. And then we hired a

33:52.094 --> 33:57.121
young man to come in to run our printing. At that 
time, we were real deep in those new entities. We

34:01.868 --> 34:04.031
were producing a lot of material. As you might 
imagine, Academy had a lot of material. BPAC had a

34:07.316 --> 34:09.840
lot of material. insurance program and all that so 
we were getting kind of getting bogged down into a

34:10.107 --> 34:39.405
workload

34:10.107 --> 34:39.405
then about that time we uh got interested in 
developing a foundation i don't know whether this

34:10.107 --> 34:39.405
follows in the sequence here go right on because 
these are key uh areas of development that's

34:10.107 --> 34:39.405
that's fine i'll straighten them out so we decided 
that uh what can we do that would augment all the

34:39.605 --> 34:41.928
things that we're already doing. So we came up with 
the idea of a non-profit C3 foundation. It wanted

34:48.577 --> 34:51.601
to be tax exempt and it could raise money. It could 
also go to other groups who had money and dedicate

34:52.281 --> 34:59.731
money to things like continuing education, 
research. We had a long-range plan of a foundation

35:06.301 --> 35:11.146
building a building, you know, a museum and some of 
these other things you probably heard talked

35:06.301 --> 35:11.146
about. They were way back. But we were trying to 
establish another organization that could be

35:12.308 --> 35:21.158
supported not only by veterinarians but by 
others. People in the drug business, people who

35:21.178 --> 35:25.963
had other foundations who wanted to support. It 
also gave us a non-profit status that we really

35:25.983 --> 35:31.209
didn't need. In other words, we could legally run 
all of our A lot of our printing, a lot of our CE could

35:35.427 --> 35:40.054
go through the foundation if we wanted to. And it 
would give us a break on things. See, the C6

35:44.441 --> 35:49.048
Corporation was what the association is. And it 
had certain things that were a little different

35:49.268 --> 35:57.300
from the foundation, although we were also A tax 
exempt, there were some things that we could not do

35:57.888 --> 36:02.597
like we could do on the foundation. We did the 
foundation primarily to do some things the

36:02.617 --> 36:09.369
association couldn't do. And it floundered for a 
while. All foundations do, and I've been involved

36:11.053 --> 36:14.158
in some. We've been in them. They're slow to 
develop. People come pretty impatient with them.

36:19.649 --> 36:20.470
But you can't do that. that has to be allowed to 
grow. And I guess we did the foundation probably in

36:22.629 --> 36:31.158
the middle of the late 70s when we got into 
developing the foundation. Now, who took

36:31.178 --> 36:34.842
leadership in that among the membership? Were 
there people who really got into that? Yeah, what

36:36.663 --> 36:45.913
we did on that is we set it up to where we'd have some 
past presidents of the organization. Okay, yeah.

36:47.154 --> 36:49.236
Set it up where they could be elected. But we had 
some slots in there where The treasurer had to be on

36:51.466 --> 36:54.589
the foundation. The president had to be on the 
foundation. And then we went out and picked, I

36:56.792 --> 36:59.795
think we had a seven-member board. I think we had 
five veterinarians and two public. So we went and

37:03.539 --> 37:08.264
got a banker, got a livestock man on there. I 
believe it was a seven-member board. The reason

37:12.448 --> 37:17.314
for it, we wanted to expand and bring in the other 
areas that are around us. But it was really still

37:19.316 --> 37:21.338
all under the umbrella. You notice that the 
Foundation, the one that's going to unwrap his

37:21.925 --> 37:28.353
book, I wanted that too. Those kinds are perfect. 
And I guess that was most of the new things we added.

37:37.704 --> 37:44.052
I thought I had a file here with a few of the things in 
it, but they're in storage.

37:47.626 --> 37:49.849
What other area do we need to cover? OK, so again, 
this is expansion, basically, from 65 on. All this

37:55.716 --> 37:57.077
time. Now, we were growing about 100 members a year 
all the time I was here. That was the time when I

38:02.764 --> 38:06.489
came, we were graduating, what, 68? Yes, that's 
steady. I remember that number. I should remember

38:08.391 --> 38:09.172
it. Yeah. And then all of a sudden, we went to 
trimester system. Yeah. They were going 130, 140.

38:15.442 --> 38:17.425
I mean, it was just out of sight. And they were going 
a year round. Instead of getting out in four years,

38:19.848 --> 38:24.074
they were getting out in three or whatever. Oh, 
man, they were clamoring, and they still are to get

38:24.094 --> 38:27.799
into that program. So veterinary medicine was in a 
real romance situation. Everybody wanted to be a

38:34.127 --> 38:37.852
veterinarian, including a lot of women. So about 
1965, I mean about 1967 or 8, We had our first woman

38:44.157 --> 38:49.904
come in, too, and graduate. And then it got to be 
where half or more of them were women. But we were

38:54.450 --> 39:00.517
growing... Now, I was supposed to interview one of 
those early women in San Antonio. I can't remember

39:00.777 --> 39:04.362
her name either now, but... Mary Mainstrom. She's 
a Georgia graduate. Are you trying to interview a

39:06.524 --> 39:09.608
TMA, TMU grad tech being a graduate? No, she was 
just one of the Billy Tremere's that said, you've

39:10.111 --> 39:13.457
got to talk to her. Mary, I guess. She's a graduate. 
See, they were admitting women way before we were.

39:19.788 --> 39:20.229
Yeah. Oklahoma State was admitting women back in 
that World War II. Yeah. Oh, yeah, and in fact, his

39:25.097 --> 39:32.550
comment was, you know, she always felt like she had 
to act like a man in order to get accepted around

39:25.097 --> 39:32.550
here or something like that. So I'm looking 
forward to meeting her. Yeah. But we were growing.

39:35.732 --> 39:42.661
See, we were down, when I came, about 600 members, 
and we left, when I left, it was something around

39:35.732 --> 39:42.661
2,300. 22, 23 hundred. I can't remember exactly 
what the exact number, but that's how much. My goal

39:47.248 --> 39:52.915
was to grow 100 members a year, and we almost did 
that. I mean, that's pretty much the way it wound

39:52.935 --> 39:55.078
up. But, and we should have grown. Yeah. potential 
was there. We went in a program where we gave

39:59.549 --> 40:02.974
everybody a membership for the first year. Okay, 
that's what I wanted to add. Let's work on this just

40:04.496 --> 40:06.118
a second. You did get most of the people coming out 
of A&M, for example, joined the TVMA, and that was

40:07.100 --> 40:17.073
one way you enticed them is by giving them the first 
year membership. That's good. That's a good

40:17.594 --> 40:18.595
strategy. We gave them complimentary 
registration when they were seniors to the

40:18.615 --> 40:23.141
convention. They could come as senior students, 
complimentary, and I think they still Maybe a

40:27.533 --> 40:31.218
little surcharge or maybe $10, $20. We started 
that, giving them a free registration and three

40:31.839 --> 40:37.226
years membership. We put them in the same status as 
we did a regular member when they got out. That's

40:41.472 --> 40:42.533
great. Yeah. And so how was your retention? It 
should have been substantial. It was real, real

40:46.899 --> 40:51.946
good because of the fact that we did show about 100. 
Yeah. See, also, Henry, in those days, we're

40:52.887 --> 40:57.253
beginning people. moving out of the state. You can 
imagine doubling the size of your veterinary

40:59.291 --> 41:10.726
school and that everybody couldn't get a job in 
Texas. A little town like Austin, for instance,

41:10.846 --> 41:21.680
they went from half a dozen veterinarians to 17 or 
18 in a matter of four or five years. And it's

41:21.980 --> 41:24.203
beginning to be a situation where where we're 
going to put all these people. And I think the

41:26.147 --> 41:30.453
students sensed that maybe we've got to go to the 
other states. We began to lose some that way. Of

41:32.496 --> 41:34.158
course, we brought some in, too. We brought 
everything we could to get the people that came in,

41:34.178 --> 41:39.525
especially the military. At that time, the draft 
of the military requirements was more than what

41:39.605 --> 41:44.652
they are now. And most of them went on to service the 
eligible people. And we tried to romance them by

41:51.098 --> 41:55.184
keeping them in the association as long as they 
were in the service. And then when they came back,

41:55.204 --> 41:59.451
we tried to nab them. So we, I don't know, I never put 
a percentage figure on it, but you also got your

41:59.471 --> 42:08.205
backdoor loss. You're always going to lose a few 
people by death, retirement, and you'll get a few,

42:08.225 --> 42:16.117
I guess, disgruntled. But the counting was good. 
Time was perfect. Let's talk about why this was

42:20.117 --> 42:24.925
such a nice time for the vet profession in Texas. 
The economy was booming. I would be very unfair if I

42:27.229 --> 42:35.823
took complete credit for doing all this without 
the type of economy that we had. It was a romance

42:35.903 --> 42:37.346
time. It was a time when veterinary medicine took 
on a much better image, and I'd like to think that we

42:37.386 --> 42:43.676
had some part in that. Okay. Oh, another thing we 
sponsored during that time, Henry, was the Mark

42:44.373 --> 42:52.023
Francis Award, which recognized media, the 
media. Now, this was done about early 70s. That was

42:54.746 --> 43:02.016
done to recognize the media that did the best 
reporting about veterinary medicine in their

42:54.746 --> 43:02.016
local community. And we routed TV stations, radio 
stations, newspaper writers, small and large. We

43:08.183 --> 43:09.385
had it set up where So many people could be from a 
newspaper with a circulation of X number and some

43:09.871 --> 43:19.522
of them in another category if they were like a 
Houston Post or a Dallas News. We also had a radio TV

43:20.043 --> 43:26.670
section that we put in and we honored anybody that 
did the reporting. As I say, the image of

43:26.690 --> 43:33.438
veterinary medicine, they were aware of the 
veterinarian. Like I say, it was a great time.

43:38.845 --> 43:48.115
After I left in 83, the economy, the worst year in 
the economy had been since then, you know. You

43:48.135 --> 43:50.938
don't have to explain what's happened since 83. I 
think about 84 is when it really all set in, you

43:51.038 --> 43:54.361
know. The real estate business went to hell. So it 
all impacted, and of course, livestock prices

43:56.644 --> 44:07.215
were always up and down, but a small animal 
practitioner, I think, had to feel perhaps more of

43:56.644 --> 44:07.215
the economy. But Houston was growing, Dallas was 
growing, the metroplex was growing, the suburbs

44:07.617 --> 44:18.286
and the little towns and people becoming more 
sophisticated with their animals, their pet

44:07.617 --> 44:18.286
animals. We had a lot of influx of the new breeds of 
cattle. Yeah, right. By the way, that's another

44:22.810 --> 44:27.855
thing we set up was the Southwestern Animal Health 
Conference for Livestock Men. That's a long name,

44:27.875 --> 44:29.676
isn't it? We did that in the early... Animal Health 
Conference for... Yeah, Animal Health

44:30.817 --> 44:33.840
Conference for Livestock Men. That was a direct 
effort to put the veterinarian on stage, for

44:38.144 --> 44:43.629
instance, and we broke it up into sections. We'd 
have an equine section, we'd have a provine

44:43.649 --> 44:52.297
section, we'd have a dairy section, we'd have a 
horse-like equine. But anyway, we broke that down

44:52.317 --> 44:59.003
and we would take a weekend and started doing it 
before the convention each time. It got to be a

44:59.023 --> 45:01.105
nightmare for the staff. Yeah, we had to handle two 
conventions. Two conventions almost at once. So

45:04.508 --> 45:08.151
what we did is we would take topics that the that 
were new topics or things that veterinarians

45:08.705 --> 45:37.345
wanted to their livestock people needed to know 
about if it were an embryo transfer or if it was a new

45:08.705 --> 45:37.345
surgical procedure in horses or if it was a new 
practice in the dairy industry trying to get

45:08.705 --> 45:37.345
people interested in what the qualifications of 
the veterinarian was what he could do if they would

45:08.705 --> 45:37.345
really come and listen so we put on seminars on all 
day Saturday, all day Sunday, every year for about

45:37.561 --> 45:44.108
a whole half dozen years, I guess. And the client, 
the veterinarian would invite their clients in.

45:48.192 --> 45:51.836
And they would take them, the dairy clients, to the 
dairy section. We'd use our own members most of the

45:51.876 --> 45:55.640
time to teach these classes. And we'd get other 
people. If we needed somebody that had the

45:57.222 --> 46:03.028
expertise we needed, we'd go to other 
universities or other practitioners in other

45:57.222 --> 46:03.028
states. And we would put on a showcase, more or 
less, of what the veterinarian can do. If you're a

46:08.386 --> 46:14.457
beef cattle man, here's some of the things that we 
can help you with. And herd health was a real big

46:14.537 --> 46:16.921
name. It was a buzzword, herd health management. 
And that was real big in the dairy business because

46:19.706 --> 46:28.341
if you get a dairyman on herd health management, in 
other words, you took care of his nutrition, You

46:28.827 --> 46:31.490
pregnancy tested animals so often. You checked 
their milking equipment and their mammary

46:31.651 --> 46:39.641
systems and how they were buying their 
replacements. The veterinarian became a manager

46:39.681 --> 46:43.486
in the dairy and also in herd health. Of course, 
feedlot got to be a big thing. That was another one.

46:46.069 --> 46:49.033
Feedlot was beginning to make its mark. We had a 
feedlot section. We'd bring in the feeders, both

46:51.176 --> 46:56.202
the big ones and those who had cattle that they just 
put in feedlots. So we try to educate the producers

46:56.975 --> 47:03.790
on what the veterinary professionals do.

47:07.538 --> 47:08.841
What do you think the...
