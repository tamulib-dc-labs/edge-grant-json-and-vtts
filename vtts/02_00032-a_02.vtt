00:02.613 --> 00:10.544
Did anybody advise you, Fish, on how to study, how to succeed as a student?

00:10.564 --> 00:12.346
If they did, I don't recall it.

00:12.526 --> 00:15.170
I've never heard of anybody of that having been done.

00:15.390 --> 00:18.795
Yes, I don't recall that being done.

00:19.556 --> 00:26.004
As you're beginning as a student, what kind of messages were you sending back home about being an Aggie?

00:26.705 --> 00:27.827
What did you tell your parents?

00:29.489 --> 00:31.692
Of course, it was during football season.

00:32.768 --> 00:38.374
And we had Jari and John Kimbrough, and we had a good team.

00:38.475 --> 00:46.103
And I was veryâ€”I had tried to play football in high school, but I was always small.

00:46.223 --> 01:00.700
And I went out for football for four years, and the only time I'd get to play is when we'd be 30 or 40 points ahead in the last two minutes of the game in high school.

01:01.928 --> 01:05.372
And then I'd worked, worked in the oil fields for two years.

01:07.395 --> 01:16.225
And uh, but I, I was never a, a first stringer.

01:16.385 --> 01:21.131
I was never a, anything except a last minute substitution.

01:23.334 --> 01:28.560
And uh, and football is really the only uh,

01:29.924 --> 01:33.009
sport that I cared anything about.

01:33.630 --> 01:58.648
I boxed, and I boxed down at A&M, and I had boxed, uh, started out boxing for the Y when I was in, uh, high school, and we used to have, uh, boxing matches with the Dallas Athletic Club boxers at all of the country clubs around, and I was a good boxer.

01:59.793 --> 02:13.633
And so Dallas Athletic Club gave me an honorary membership to box for them and I got to wear silk trunks instead of my cotton khaki shorts.

02:13.653 --> 02:16.658
And a bunch of the upperclassmen knew it.

02:17.859 --> 02:26.492
And so I always was, I boxed down at A&M in the spring.

02:27.974 --> 02:33.324
Boxing, really, that's about the only sport I tried to participate in.

02:34.246 --> 02:42.582
But as you began to become a real student at A&M, what did you tell your parents about how it was going?

02:43.163 --> 02:45.468
Did you write them or call them on the phone?

02:45.608 --> 02:46.389
No, I wrote.

02:46.790 --> 02:46.991
How often?

02:47.051 --> 02:48.754
And I was required to write every day.

02:48.994 --> 02:49.736
Every day?

02:49.756 --> 02:50.337
Every day.

02:50.924 --> 02:52.266
What did you tell your parents?

02:52.526 --> 03:12.875
Well I told them what was going what I was doing and the friends I was making and that somebody else I met from Dallas and they'd gone to Woodrow Wilson High School or they'd gone to North Dallas or they'd gone to another high school but that they were becoming good friends.

03:14.036 --> 03:16.720
If we had those letters today would they be positive?

03:16.800 --> 03:17.421
Would you be

03:17.907 --> 03:20.270
Did you reflect that you liked A&M?

03:20.290 --> 03:21.251
You were glad you were there?

03:21.572 --> 03:22.072
Oh, yes.

03:22.773 --> 03:32.926
I was glad to get that and could see the seniors that I thought were going to be successes.

03:34.188 --> 03:38.213
And I thought I'd try to mimic those and do like they did.

03:39.594 --> 03:44.100
Did you make some early friends that lasted a long time?

03:44.603 --> 03:46.805
Yes, I did.

03:47.426 --> 03:50.669
Who were some of those dear friends?

03:54.113 --> 04:12.332
Well, let me think, well of course Herbert was, Hank Martin, gosh I can't call the guy that went to Annapolis, he was

04:13.426 --> 04:17.591
He started out at A&M and then got an appointment to Annapolis.

04:17.691 --> 04:22.317
Dick Van Orden is still a good friend of mine.

04:22.337 --> 04:29.066
I said Hank Martin, a very good friend.

04:31.409 --> 04:35.434
Chink, call him Chink.

04:37.136 --> 04:41.982
He's from Texarkana, Keene.

04:43.447 --> 04:49.814
I hadn't thought about some of these people in 30 years.

04:51.255 --> 04:55.120
When you and your buddies went to class, how did you all behave in class?

04:57.722 --> 04:59.825
Were there any pranks that you all tried in class?

05:00.986 --> 05:02.728
I don't recall any of that.

05:03.228 --> 05:05.291
At least I didn't.

05:05.551 --> 05:09.195
It may have happened and I just... Did you go to class regularly?

05:09.635 --> 05:11.617
Yes, I never missed a class.

05:11.858 --> 05:12.238
I was...

05:13.568 --> 05:20.258
During the, working in the oil fields two years, I was anxious to get an education.

05:20.458 --> 05:21.560
You had a good incentive.

05:21.940 --> 05:31.915
Yes, and it was a very good thing for me to, I applied myself and I made pretty good grades too.

05:32.384 --> 05:41.033
that first fall, describe what it was like for a freshman to go see that Aggie football team play football.

05:41.513 --> 05:54.246
What was a... Oh, it was very exciting and we, on Friday, on Saturday morning, we met and we marched to the stadium.

05:55.948 --> 06:00.012
And, of course, freshmen sat at the bottom

06:00.464 --> 06:02.406
sophomores, juniors, seniors.

06:03.788 --> 06:11.377
And we all tried to get either on the first row or the top row of the freshman line.

06:13.260 --> 06:16.203
And you wore uniform to the game?

06:16.524 --> 06:16.904
Yes.

06:18.947 --> 06:23.412
And were there yell practices then?

06:23.753 --> 06:24.173
Oh, yes.

06:24.293 --> 06:25.314
Where did you have those?

06:25.475 --> 06:29.880
On the steps of the Y. They were not at midnight though, were they?

06:30.181 --> 06:40.616
Well, you may have had two a year at midnight yell practice, but the majority of them were after the evening meal and on the steps of the wide.

06:40.736 --> 06:44.702
That first year, did you have any dates come down for a football game?

06:46.404 --> 06:50.350
No, because my girl was going to Stevens.

06:51.325 --> 06:52.927
In Columbia, Missouri?

06:53.047 --> 06:53.427
Yes.

06:53.708 --> 06:54.188
Oh really?

06:54.369 --> 06:54.789
Yes.

06:55.650 --> 07:17.175
And she was my girl in high school, you know, and she was up there and so we didn't have, Stevens was an all-girls school and they, we'd see each other at Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter.

07:18.617 --> 07:20.539
Let me give you a bit of trivia I learned

07:21.008 --> 07:32.019
when I was chancellor at the University of Missouri, that they would gather the Stevens girls in the big Union stations in St.

07:32.039 --> 07:35.422
Louis and in Kansas City in September.

07:35.803 --> 07:36.163
Yes.

07:36.263 --> 07:46.273
Then they would charter two entire trains and bring two train loads of Stevens girls to Columbia by sheer accident.

07:46.658 --> 07:59.490
By sheer coincidence, all of the Missouri fraternity boys would just happen to be at the railroad station to carry those girls' bags and to get their names and their room number.

08:01.111 --> 08:04.134
That was the way they would get their first dates with her.

08:04.695 --> 08:13.543
Well, she went, and this was my first wife, she went to Stevens and

08:14.654 --> 08:17.098
You had met her at Highland Park?

08:17.198 --> 08:17.579
Yes.

08:17.839 --> 08:18.120
Okay.

08:18.661 --> 08:21.325
And did you start writing to her regularly also?

08:21.345 --> 08:21.585
Oh, yes.

08:21.806 --> 08:33.124
I wrote probably three times a week and got mail from her and we'd see each other in the summer.

08:33.144 --> 08:34.447
All right.

08:34.507 --> 08:36.269
So you didn't have a date at football game.

08:37.732 --> 08:42.079
Did you guys behave yourselves at the football game or did you sometimes...

08:42.835 --> 08:52.950
Oh we pretty well watched, I think it was our freshman year that we were national champs.

08:52.970 --> 09:03.265
And we were, Jari and John, and we had one of the football players that lived with us, Baby Ron, Leon Ron.

09:04.307 --> 09:05.048
R-O-N-N?

09:05.208 --> 09:08.413
No, R-O-E-N, I believe, R-O-H-N.

09:08.593 --> 09:10.716
R-O-H-N, that's right.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.988
And he was in our outfit.

09:16.993 --> 09:20.398
Did those star athletes go to class and make their grades?

09:20.919 --> 09:21.299
Yes.

09:21.940 --> 09:25.145
There weren't any phony?

09:25.846 --> 09:27.148
Baby's the only one I knew.

09:27.168 --> 09:28.530
We called him Baby Ron.

09:30.152 --> 09:36.061
He was very serious about doing what he did.

09:37.924 --> 09:39.927
He was serious about his class.

09:40.919 --> 10:05.290
work and of course he was a junior or senior when I was a freshman I think he's probably a junior because I had baby was there for two years describe John Kimbrough as a person as far as you what was your impression of him as a person that he was a very nice guy

10:06.350 --> 10:17.149
but I had only met him once or twice and he didn't know who I was and I didn't know who he was really other than by reputation.

10:17.731 --> 10:19.734
Did you all see much of Coach Norton?

10:19.754 --> 10:21.878
Was he very visible on campus?

10:22.229 --> 10:28.775
Not to me he wasn't, but of course I was taking a... You were taking a heavy load.

10:29.015 --> 10:38.764
Yeah, and I was in school, I was in classroom probably seven hours of every day and four hours on Saturdays.

10:41.727 --> 10:50.515
The, did that, early that first semester did you come home to visit?

10:52.115 --> 10:54.758
Yes, probably twice in the semester, though.

10:55.239 --> 10:56.180
No more than that.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.141
How did you get back?

10:59.003 --> 11:03.068
Well, there was a non-reg guy named Duck Florence.

11:04.589 --> 11:11.257
We had two guys from A&M from Dallas that both had cars down there.

11:11.317 --> 11:17.104
There were only about seven or eight cars on the whole campus, Chiefy Butler and Duck Florence.

11:18.305 --> 11:20.147
And they were not in our outfit.

11:21.393 --> 11:33.845
And neither, both of them were juniors and seniors, and they, uh, were not in our outfit, but I used to go to the post office.

11:33.905 --> 11:35.187
I got to know they were there.

11:35.847 --> 11:43.415
I'd pick their mail up and bring their mail back to them and drop it off back on my way to Hart Hall.

11:44.696 --> 11:46.658
Uh, they, they live right

11:48.241 --> 11:53.787
The dormitory right here where the mess hall was there, they lived in this, what was that?

11:54.487 --> 12:00.594
Wasn't legged, but that dormitory there in Hart Hall was down here.

12:00.634 --> 12:03.897
And I'd pick their mail up for them.

12:04.798 --> 12:13.607
And as a consequence, when I ever wanted to go home on the weekend, I had a ride to and from Dallas with either the chief here.

12:14.748 --> 12:16.830
About how long the drive was it then?

12:18.076 --> 12:26.007
It was about a good three and a half hour drive.

12:26.248 --> 12:27.489
What route did you all take?

12:31.315 --> 12:33.959
We went through Corsicana.

12:35.501 --> 12:40.828
Down through Mejia and Grossbeck and Calvert and Hearn.

12:41.029 --> 12:41.369
Right.

12:44.033 --> 12:47.678
Did you ever hitchhike when you were at A&M?

12:48.890 --> 12:54.096
Yeah, when I couldn't get a ride that I didn't have a friend that I could get a ride from, I'd hitchhike.

12:54.497 --> 13:00.864
And we'd hitchhike going to Houston on a weekend when we got to be upperclassmen.

13:01.685 --> 13:05.490
Describe how an Aggie, what was the routine for an Aggie hitchhiker?

13:06.391 --> 13:16.163
Well, you'd get out there and you'd get in line and wait your turn and just, it was unreal.

13:16.868 --> 13:23.577
Out of ten cars that went by, seven of them would stop to pick up an Aggie.

13:23.597 --> 13:27.202
Did you ever have a bad Aggie hitchhiking experience?

13:28.343 --> 13:31.547
Did anything bad ever happen to you?

13:31.808 --> 13:32.749
No, not to me.

13:33.230 --> 13:37.816
So far, no one has had any bad experience.

13:37.836 --> 13:42.522
Did anything amusing, goofy ever happen to you?

13:45.286 --> 13:46.708
Oh I don't remember.

13:46.768 --> 14:07.834
We tried to be very polite and uh cooperative and occasionally uh particularly going from school to Dallas uh a guy would stop and say, I want a senior to drive me.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.231
And regardless of where the senior was, the first senior got in.

14:14.271 --> 14:31.341
And they'd frequently, I'd say that would happen, one out of ten guys that would stop to let you in, they'd want a senior to drive.

14:32.097 --> 14:39.707
If you were leaving Dallas to go back to College Station, where in the Dallas area was the best place to get a ride?

14:41.109 --> 14:43.392
I don't know because I never hitchhiked down.

14:43.652 --> 14:44.433
Oh, okay.

14:44.654 --> 14:47.517
Because I always came home with either Duck or Chiefy.

14:48.819 --> 14:49.760
They had cars.

14:50.601 --> 14:54.927
Those were the, I don't believe there were seven or eight guys that had cars.

14:55.027 --> 15:00.855
Two of them were from Dallas, and I made friends with both of them, and they were upperclassmen.

15:01.882 --> 15:06.486
That first fall, do you remember going on a court trip?

15:06.506 --> 15:06.907
Yes.

15:07.487 --> 15:08.308
Describe that.

15:10.350 --> 15:13.813
Fort Worth was the court trip I went to.

15:14.213 --> 15:19.338
I was in Dallas and just went over for the game.

15:20.939 --> 15:26.144
How did you feel marching down that street as an Aggie?

15:26.684 --> 15:27.565
I felt proud.

15:27.605 --> 15:31.669
I was glad to be an Aggie and thought we looked good.

15:32.324 --> 15:42.601
The crowds always were very appreciative of the A&M Corps as it marched for whatever purpose.

15:42.701 --> 15:44.163
And did you all behave yourselves?

15:44.544 --> 15:45.385
Yes, we did.

15:47.048 --> 15:47.328
I see.

15:47.349 --> 15:52.577
That would have been an interesting game because Davey O'Brien would have been the TCU quarterback.

15:53.452 --> 16:16.573
good show and let's see the SMU game that year Preston Johnson would have been the SMU star I remember that name I but I don't remember much about the game at that game when

16:17.347 --> 16:21.175
Well, this would be in my junior and senior years.

16:22.297 --> 16:23.058
I'd have a date.

16:23.119 --> 16:26.305
At this time, Cherry was back at home, and I'd have a date with her.

16:29.151 --> 16:31.596
What would you all do after the game?

16:31.696 --> 16:33.820
Where would you all go for a good time?

16:34.137 --> 16:37.922
Generally we'd go to Dallas Country Club.

16:38.643 --> 16:39.604
She was a member.

16:39.984 --> 16:46.112
Our family weren't members of the country club, but Cherry's family was members of the country club.

16:47.193 --> 17:00.229
And we'd go over there and on Friday evening and Saturday evening they'd have a band playing and we'd dance and we knew a lot of the people that were there.

17:01.272 --> 17:12.446
Back that freshman year was the court trip, do you remember when the court trip was to Austin or Houston?

17:14.008 --> 17:14.990
Fort Worth up here?

17:16.852 --> 17:28.427
I think it was probably Houston because I stayed with Rosie Townsend

17:29.555 --> 17:35.304
his at his house and it would have been my freshman year that I'd have done that.

17:35.945 --> 17:39.089
And you hadn't been to Houston before had you?

17:39.109 --> 17:50.386
Probably driving through when we were kids going to Galveston but I hadn't been as a grown-up that I knew anything about.

17:50.426 --> 17:53.571
How did you do academically that first semester?

17:54.175 --> 17:56.178
I made pretty good grades.

17:56.839 --> 18:00.263
I was a good student.

18:00.744 --> 18:03.487
So that you felt good when you came home for Christmas.

18:03.848 --> 18:04.188
Yeah.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.432
And Mom and Dad, they were pleased.

18:07.993 --> 18:09.455
They were very pleased.

18:11.938 --> 18:16.044
But see, I worked two years and I got a little matured.

18:16.064 --> 18:17.185
That's what I was thinking.

18:17.686 --> 18:22.292
And the time I went to school, I recognized that

18:23.285 --> 18:29.954
The guys that had an education and knew something were the guys that I had been working for.

18:30.575 --> 18:38.786
All right, at the end of your freshman year, the spring of 1940, the war is on in Europe.

18:39.307 --> 18:39.648
Right.

18:39.948 --> 18:42.552
Did you and your buddies talk about that much?

18:42.672 --> 18:46.136
No, no, the war was on in Europe, but we weren't in it.

18:46.156 --> 18:46.777
Yes, sir.

18:46.797 --> 18:48.179
Did you all talk about that much?

18:48.560 --> 18:49.461
Very little.

18:50.082 --> 18:52.625
What did you do at the end of your first year in the summer?

18:52.885 --> 18:56.509
You didn't go to summer camp, ROTC camp, did you?

18:56.609 --> 18:58.130
No, I did not.

18:58.150 --> 18:58.871
Who'd you work for?

18:59.832 --> 19:02.695
Continental Supply Company.

19:03.756 --> 19:07.800
And I was, I worked for Continental Supply Company.

19:09.262 --> 19:18.992
And my job was helping to set pumping units,

19:20.103 --> 19:28.712
and on the Roustabout Gang, and we were setting pumping units and building tank batteries.

19:29.632 --> 19:32.135
Where did that take you?

19:32.275 --> 19:41.444
I was primarily working out of Wichita Falls, and we were in the Wichita Falls area.

19:42.025 --> 19:45.368
Where it never gets hot in the summer.

19:46.563 --> 19:49.667
We lived in Wichita Falls in the summer and fall of 41.

19:49.727 --> 19:51.049
Oh, you did?

19:51.109 --> 19:51.469
Yes, sir.

19:51.670 --> 19:58.719
Well, I was probably there living in a bunkhouse for Continental Supply Company.

19:58.739 --> 20:07.090
Right, you go back in the fall then of 1940, you're still a petroleum engineer, and you're pleased at being at A&M.

20:10.434 --> 20:13.498
You stayed on petroleum, you stayed on that same major.

20:14.860 --> 20:15.220
Right.

20:15.520 --> 20:19.345
Who did you turn to for advice as to what courses to take?

20:20.626 --> 20:44.076
Well pretty well you had required courses and you said on there you may have had one optional course a semester and I probably took advice from my freshman year Bill Slayton who was a company commander or battery commander

20:44.714 --> 20:52.161
And he had dated Betty, my sister, and had gone to high school.

20:52.221 --> 20:55.884
He was ahead of me, but I knew who he was, and he knew who I was.

20:57.906 --> 21:13.641
And my sister was a real popular girl, so all of the older people in her class knew me as Betty's little brother, and they treated me very nicely.

21:15.308 --> 21:24.918
The routine there, so you're studying, you're doing well.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.843
Who were the campus leaders at that time?

21:30.184 --> 21:33.688
Was Gib Gilchrist was dean of engineering?

21:34.449 --> 21:36.291
I think he was dean of engineering.

21:36.511 --> 21:37.532
I didn't know him.

21:37.892 --> 21:39.594
Who was president?

21:39.614 --> 21:41.056
I think it was Walton.

21:42.097 --> 21:43.138
Did y'all ever see?

21:43.709 --> 21:45.631
Dr. Walton?

21:46.192 --> 21:46.793
Never did.

21:46.813 --> 21:47.654
I never did.

21:47.674 --> 21:51.458
And nobody played any jokes on the president's house or anything like that?

21:51.618 --> 21:55.223
No, his house was on campus.

21:56.825 --> 22:04.013
But to my knowledge, and let me say this, my freshman year was when we opened what we call the new area.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.455
That's the new dorm.

22:05.615 --> 22:06.396
What were they like?

22:07.838 --> 22:09.320
You very seldom got over there.

22:09.380 --> 22:12.163
They were so far away from

22:12.751 --> 22:19.220
Hart Hall, but they were in a line and they were all grouped together.

22:19.260 --> 22:22.325
Did you all think those were pretty fancy dorms?

22:22.465 --> 22:26.851
We thought they were very fancy dorms.

22:27.052 --> 22:34.122
As you were settling in as a sophomore, how did you treat freshmen?

22:34.142 --> 22:35.604
What kind of a sophomore were you?

22:40.912 --> 22:42.454
I was

22:45.860 --> 22:56.113
I recognized early that some of the kids that came there were young.

22:56.493 --> 23:03.562
Now see, I had worked two years before I had gotten out of high school to work two years before I went to A&M.

23:05.044 --> 23:13.234
And some of the kids were young and inexperienced and you tried to

23:15.172 --> 23:37.301
tell them it was, uh, their parents were spending a lot of money to send them down there and it was their duty to do the right thing and be attentive and attend class and, uh, do their work and make it worthwhile for their parents and that their parents were counting on them to do that and those kind of lectures.

23:38.002 --> 23:39.283
Did you use the board ever?

23:39.744 --> 23:40.305
Yes, sir.

23:40.705 --> 23:42.588
What kind of board did you use?

23:42.608 --> 23:45.111
I had a baseball bat that was, uh,

23:45.985 --> 23:50.615
flattened off like that, slap happy.

23:52.559 --> 23:57.610
You would be most likely to use that paddle after they'd done what?

23:59.334 --> 24:05.968
If they had made bad grades.

24:08.024 --> 24:08.865
I'd use it.

24:09.306 --> 24:13.593
If they were skipping class, going to class, I'd use the board.

24:14.455 --> 24:16.178
And this is my sophomore year.

24:16.278 --> 24:16.598
Yes, sir.

24:17.920 --> 24:22.728
My junior year, I was first sergeant, and I used it for a lot of things then.

24:24.031 --> 24:31.483
And I was CEO of the Outfit my senior year, and didn't really do use it much my senior year.

24:32.392 --> 24:38.541
Were those students in classes behind you, were they allowed to call you by your nickname?

24:38.982 --> 24:40.444
No.

24:40.504 --> 24:41.486
Mr. Bright.

24:41.506 --> 24:41.786
Did they?

24:41.846 --> 24:43.348
Well, now sophomores were.

24:43.689 --> 24:44.009
Okay.

24:44.690 --> 24:47.795
But freshmen couldn't.

24:47.815 --> 24:50.780
Did they sometimes do it to see how you would react?

24:51.841 --> 24:52.963
I don't recall that.

24:53.143 --> 24:53.784
Okay, that one.

24:55.747 --> 24:59.192
Describe the student body of the four years you were at A&M.

24:59.212 --> 25:01.015
Describe the student body in general.

25:01.433 --> 25:02.715
Where did they come from?

25:03.055 --> 25:04.197
What kind of families?

25:04.257 --> 25:05.239
What kind of income?

25:05.719 --> 25:06.861
What kind of attitudes?

25:08.744 --> 25:16.756
Well, generally I think the good 90 to 95 percent were from Texas.

25:18.058 --> 25:21.383
A few from Louisiana.

25:22.713 --> 25:25.797
Oklahoma and New Mexico.

25:25.817 --> 25:37.173
It seemed that they had a group from Mexico always, but by that group I'm talking about 15 or 20 people.

25:37.914 --> 25:41.839
And what, as far as you know, what led them to be at A&M?

25:42.900 --> 25:46.425
Did they come up to major in certain subjects?

25:48.788 --> 25:50.511
I don't know what led them.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.213
I don't know whether they,

25:53.307 --> 25:55.469
We never had one of them in our outfit.

25:55.549 --> 25:57.431
They took mostly ag courses.

25:57.651 --> 25:59.092
And they were not poor boys, were they?

25:59.492 --> 25:59.733
No.

26:01.374 --> 26:05.337
But they took mostly agricultural courses and they were over in the new area.

26:06.559 --> 26:11.183
And ours were primarily engineers in the coast artillery.

26:12.143 --> 26:15.266
All right, they were, the student, most of them were from Texas.

26:15.306 --> 26:17.868
Were they country boys or city boys or what?

26:19.350 --> 26:22.032
In the... No, in general.

26:22.838 --> 26:24.460
The people that came to Indian?

26:24.480 --> 26:26.342
Yes, sir.

26:26.362 --> 26:49.268
Uh, I'd say they were prime, they were probably, uh, 60 to 65 percent, uh, country and maybe 25, 30 percent, uh, city, Dallas, Houston, uh, Wichita Falls, Midland, Lubbock,

26:50.159 --> 26:55.107
What kinds of family income did they come from?

27:01.176 --> 27:02.798
Mostly middle to lower.

27:06.184 --> 27:07.746
Did they know what hard work was?

27:09.515 --> 27:14.260
Not the kind of hard work that I'd done, you know.

27:15.941 --> 27:23.549
You had very few people that were out two years before they went to college.

27:24.590 --> 27:31.197
And I was out because my sister was in school and our family couldn't afford but one in school at a time.

27:32.438 --> 27:39.285
And were there some, in terms of their national ancestry,

27:39.569 --> 27:40.491
Was there a mix?

27:41.312 --> 27:45.620
Were there German and Czech and Polish?

27:47.243 --> 28:02.472
Was there a wide variety of... Oh, I think there were, and now that you mention that, I think you used to tease them about where they might be from.

28:03.548 --> 28:08.395
And this was primarily European and Mexican.

28:10.678 --> 28:16.526
I don't recall any Central Americans, but there may have been a few from Panama.

28:17.027 --> 28:18.228
Were there any Jewish boys?

28:19.770 --> 28:20.151
Yes.

28:21.112 --> 28:26.300
Actually, my roommate, of course, Herbert, he had gone a year at SMU.

28:26.700 --> 28:27.882
He was half Jewish.

28:28.102 --> 28:32.408
He couldn't get in the fraternity, and that's why he switched to A&M.

28:32.928 --> 29:00.623
uh now and were were all of these different people accepted as real Aggies yeah that's so marvelous why was that true what did oh I don't know it seemed like uh it was A&M against the world you know and you were uh Aggie born and Aggie bred and when I die being Aggie dead that

29:03.303 --> 29:06.677
Do you remember going to your first Silver Taps?

29:07.323 --> 29:07.727
Yeah.

29:08.247 --> 29:35.773
describe that how describe the routine well I did not know what it was but they told me we're having silver taps tonight and I think it was happened at 10 o'clock or something like I don't remember what it was but you went out and stood and they did silver taps from the academic building I guess they still do I don't know and it was an Aggie and he had died and uh

29:36.800 --> 29:39.805
Everybody was supposed to say a prayer for him.

29:40.907 --> 29:47.036
And Bill Slayton said he was better commander then my freshman year.

29:48.419 --> 29:51.283
And he said, no horseplay, no nothing.

29:52.385 --> 29:54.228
We're honoring the memory of an Aggie.

29:55.270 --> 30:02.942
And so we go out and stand outside of Hart Hall and they play silver taps.

30:04.407 --> 30:14.464
And you get through, and you say a little prayer, and the guys that were, I guess, real realistic, they'd go, you know, say a little cross, say a little prayer.

30:14.505 --> 30:20.695
And everybody took it seriously.

30:20.735 --> 30:22.438
Nobody did any pranks.

30:22.458 --> 30:23.640
Oh, no.

30:24.722 --> 30:28.609
In your years as an A&M student, did you ever lose a close friend?

30:30.698 --> 30:33.565
No, I never lost a close friend.

30:33.605 --> 30:40.463
I lost a lot of people I knew, but never real that were running mates.

30:40.483 --> 30:42.648
And that tradition did not vary, did it?

30:43.170 --> 30:45.315
No, not during my career.

30:46.055 --> 30:56.486
That was a unifying event.

30:58.068 --> 31:01.812
Did you go to any kind of religious activities while you were at A&M?

31:02.953 --> 31:15.927
Yes, we were Episcopalians and I went to the church either once or twice but it was a little bit out of the way and it was inconvenient to go to and

31:17.425 --> 31:18.089
I didn't.

31:18.411 --> 31:20.565
So you didn't go regularly on Sunday?

31:20.646 --> 31:20.807
No.

31:20.968 --> 31:22.357
What was your routine on a Sunday?

31:22.377 --> 31:24.229
Did you sleep in?
