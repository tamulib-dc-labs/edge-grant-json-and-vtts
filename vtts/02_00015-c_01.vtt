00:02.174 --> 00:04.617
Proudest moments.

00:06.239 --> 00:07.421
Proudest moments.

00:07.541 --> 00:08.402
Proudest moments.

00:13.669 --> 00:14.470
As you look back.

00:17.795 --> 00:19.277
Proudest moments.

00:20.959 --> 00:24.023
There have been a couple and they're equal.

00:27.808 --> 00:29.110
When I watched

00:30.878 --> 00:54.844
One of the students that had graduated from A&M, that I had taught, become president of the state organization, awarded a high AVMA award, elected to AVMA executive board, something like that, where somebody

00:55.043 --> 01:02.497
that I was a little tiny part of their life succeeded in some grand and glowing acknowledgement.

01:03.639 --> 01:07.045
It was like that was probably the warmest, proudest thing you could see.

01:08.167 --> 01:16.883
Okay, now on the comedy side, goofiest or funniest or most incredible.

01:25.773 --> 01:32.264
Such a good time all the time, it's hard.

01:32.284 --> 01:40.798
So, for example, I had a student in History 105 one year, and this was the first meeting of the third week of the class.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.044
And I said, before I began, are there any questions?

01:44.184 --> 01:44.845
He said,

01:45.905 --> 01:49.591
Is this physics 201?

01:49.631 --> 01:50.693
I said, no.

01:51.634 --> 01:54.459
He folded up his notes and he said, I thought so.

01:55.561 --> 01:57.925
He had been there for six class weeks.

01:57.945 --> 02:02.713
I figured it out.

02:02.993 --> 02:03.274
Nothing?

02:03.294 --> 02:07.120
I can't think of one funny one.

02:07.268 --> 02:16.179
Students would always be doing stuff in the gross anatomy lab, so I guess walking into the lab and there's somebody sitting on one of the mounted horses that's being hung and that kind of stuff.

02:17.080 --> 02:34.580
I would say when I think of most disappointing, catching students cheating in class.

02:35.361 --> 02:35.942
How often?

02:36.597 --> 02:37.959
I have probably the record.

02:39.121 --> 02:40.384
No, but... I'm serious.

02:40.925 --> 02:50.982
Would that be once... I have... I can think of four separate instances right off the top of my head.

02:51.002 --> 02:54.769
But you're saying four in 30 years.

02:54.789 --> 02:55.450
Yeah.

02:56.003 --> 02:59.148
Yeah, I mean, no, it isn't running rampant.

03:00.050 --> 03:08.444
And I guess that's probably why it stands out, because most of these students really are working very hard to do a good job.

03:09.346 --> 03:13.793
And I can remember one where a student came and reported it to me.

03:13.773 --> 03:16.557
And they said, well, we don't want to mention any names.

03:16.637 --> 03:26.750
And I said, you tell me so I can get you out of the loop and I can be the one to find out so I could get the pressure off that student.

03:27.771 --> 03:30.795
And I was able to nail them on the next exam.

03:31.416 --> 03:34.440
Were the situations handled appropriately?

03:35.161 --> 03:35.982
Yeah, yeah.

03:36.803 --> 03:38.565
You know, it's one of those things.

03:40.452 --> 03:48.146
I loved the old days because, man, if I caught them, I'd slam them and embarrass the heck out of them right then and there and get them out.

03:48.307 --> 03:49.890
And you didn't have to go through all the red tape.

03:49.910 --> 03:52.134
And I didn't have to worry about anything else.

03:52.935 --> 03:59.828
And nowadays, even if you prove it within, I mean, to the hilt, and you can show.

04:00.145 --> 04:02.390
they still give the benefit to the student.

04:02.511 --> 04:05.518
And I'm sorry, but that wasn't the way I was raised.

04:05.898 --> 04:11.451
And I've got to deal with a narcotics license, and I don't want that sucker out there with a narcotics license, too.

04:11.471 --> 04:12.353
I agree with you.

04:12.373 --> 04:14.358
I agree with you.

04:15.260 --> 04:16.483
Two questions left.

04:17.425 --> 04:27.234
First of those two is somebody walks up to you and hands you a check for a million dollars with one requirement.

04:27.595 --> 04:34.682
You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you get to decide what A&M is to do with the million dollars.

04:35.542 --> 04:36.423
Oh, that's easy.

04:36.684 --> 04:36.784
What?

04:36.804 --> 04:38.826
That's the easiest question in the whole world.

04:39.066 --> 04:41.008
We're going to establish a chair in animal behavior.

04:41.048 --> 04:45.492
I'm going to get that sucker as a permanent part of this college.

04:45.539 --> 04:46.861
Okay.

04:46.881 --> 04:47.541
Last question.

04:47.622 --> 04:50.645
What feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M today?

04:50.665 --> 04:51.867
I love Texas A&M.

04:53.469 --> 04:55.531
I absolutely love Texas A&M.

04:56.092 --> 04:56.833
I am an Aggie.

04:57.254 --> 05:02.420
I don't quite bleed maroon, although Minnesota was maroon and gold, so it's part of me.

05:03.842 --> 05:12.913
But when I realized the importance that A&M has always had for the student, based on muster,

05:16.555 --> 05:16.984
That's it.

05:17.373 --> 05:17.740
That's it.
