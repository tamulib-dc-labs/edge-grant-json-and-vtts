WEBVTT

00:03.760 --> 00:25.633
of us and you know eliminate who they want to get over here and even work with and I was never in the get over here and work with group so that when you went to A&M under Coach Bryant if you had any kind of an athletic scholarship you were out for football if you were a track man if you were a golfer you were out for football Bobby Nichols who became PGA champion

00:25.613 --> 00:32.039
He had been a football player under Coach Ryan up in Kentucky, and he brought him down on a golf scholarship.

00:32.059 --> 00:34.761
So I was in the mullet patrol, you know.

00:34.781 --> 00:40.166
In fact, don't even write anything about me being an athlete because it's a missed note.

00:40.187 --> 00:40.767
Carolyn, sit down.

00:40.827 --> 00:42.268
We're telling some great tales.

00:44.010 --> 00:44.210
Okay.

00:46.332 --> 00:50.296
Describe Colonel Indy as a person, as a coach.

00:51.157 --> 00:52.198
He was pretty aloof.

00:52.258 --> 00:54.760
I mean, he had...

00:55.094 --> 01:00.395
He'd talk to you when he was ready to and he'd stand out there and walk around practice and watch everything.

01:01.239 --> 01:04.733
You know, there was not a lot of direct coaching on his part.

01:05.320 --> 01:08.724
Okay.

01:08.964 --> 01:11.507
He was a, you didn't play any jokes with him.

01:11.787 --> 01:12.147
Oh, no.

01:12.308 --> 01:14.310
He was all busy.

01:14.670 --> 01:15.771
Describe him physically.

01:16.152 --> 01:17.593
We don't know much about him.

01:17.974 --> 01:19.956
He just, you know, slight little guy.

01:20.677 --> 01:20.957
Five?

01:21.698 --> 01:22.178
I don't know.

01:22.198 --> 01:26.583
I mean, he seemed big as a house, you know, to me at that time.

01:29.286 --> 01:30.147
Get out the door.

01:33.738 --> 02:00.235
uh did did you all have respect for colonel and of course he was a legend now putman you know was the uh he was really more the hands-on coach he and when you had a lot of those things he drew they had these old long maroon chevrolet we used to call them the uh the gooses and they had a lot of them were white with maroon things they had one or two that were just terrible pieces of crap

02:00.215 --> 02:02.819
Is that what y'all rode into the track meets?

02:02.839 --> 02:02.939
Yeah.

02:03.040 --> 02:07.206
Sometime you'd go to, you know, like the cross-country team would go and those.

02:07.948 --> 02:12.014
It was... Describe a typical track team trip.

02:12.776 --> 02:21.410
Well, my favorite recollection, the one we used to laugh about, Bones was the athletic director.

02:21.450 --> 02:23.253
Bones Irwin, you remember him?

02:23.273 --> 02:23.553
Barlow Irwin.

02:23.593 --> 02:25.176
Yeah.

02:26.422 --> 02:50.843
he would give you like two dollars and fifty cents and tell you one of the receipts and the change back that was your real money well even then two dollars and fifty cents was not a lot of money and and you know we didn't stay anywhere you know you finished and loaded up and drove to go back so they didn't have to pay for a hotel or motel range

02:51.430 --> 02:55.035
In Port Arthur, we had our own buses.

02:56.678 --> 03:01.585
We traveled first class, and I ask you, and you go to A&M, and it was pretty ratty.

03:01.865 --> 03:04.790
All right, now the football team, by comparison.

03:05.391 --> 03:08.295
Oh, that was, you know, they were first class by comparison.

03:08.595 --> 03:12.862
But the football team was way down on the totem pole compared to other schools.

03:12.882 --> 03:19.672
But under Bryant, all the other sports got much less attention, didn't they?

03:19.812 --> 03:20.593
Sure.

03:20.843 --> 03:21.644
I mean, that's what I said.

03:21.684 --> 03:24.529
Everyone was out for football.

03:24.609 --> 03:27.173
You know, it was because he understood.

03:27.193 --> 03:33.322
I mean, that's why the football team played four home games and everything else on the road.

03:33.362 --> 03:40.392
We played Rice every year in Houston and LSU every year in Baton Rouge, and it was a money thing.

03:41.033 --> 03:48.825
That's why when I became active in the former students and the Aggie Club, which became the 12th man,

03:49.447 --> 03:55.213
You know, the first thing that when Biebs came down there, you know, he said, well, what do you think we ought to do?

03:55.253 --> 04:03.421
I said, you know, we've got to expand that stadium because nobody's going to play us home and home until, you know, we got out of that 40,000-seat cracker box.

04:03.921 --> 04:07.845
And we had to stretch to get that upper deck on the other side.

04:08.006 --> 04:14.492
And I tell people, Emery Ballard, by expanding that stadium,

04:14.675 --> 04:18.961
And getting that program turned around, they ought to erect a statue to him down there.

04:18.981 --> 04:23.568
Now, Jackie Sherrill came in and he took it to the next level and gets a lot of credit.

04:24.450 --> 04:30.218
And people say, well, you know, Reigns, you've devoted too much time and attention to athletics.

04:30.238 --> 04:31.780
And I said, let me show you a little chart.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.762
And I put this together.

04:32.782 --> 04:33.884
I used to make this argument.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.227
I said, here is.

04:37.372 --> 04:42.679
the performance of your football team and the giving to the university.

04:43.240 --> 04:47.006
And it follows the same thing at every major university.

04:47.026 --> 04:51.031
And when the University of California, they finally figured that out.

04:52.373 --> 04:53.915
Stanford has figured it out.

04:54.616 --> 04:57.700
And I'm not saying it's right, wrong, or indifferent.

04:57.721 --> 04:58.742
I'm just a weatherman.

04:59.203 --> 05:02.367
You know, there is a correlation between these two.

05:02.920 --> 05:11.550
And a big part of A&M, and I think the thing that, and the reason athletics brings everyone together is one common denominator.

05:11.910 --> 05:18.357
And the larger the school gets, you know, the core used to be the common experience.

05:19.278 --> 05:27.427
And the common experience that we have, we have a lot of things going for us, but I still think athletics is important as a unifier.

05:27.667 --> 05:28.388
Cities have it.

05:28.969 --> 05:31.071
One of the arguments I made when, hush,

05:31.692 --> 05:46.314
when we built the stadiums down here because cities need, you know, from the times of the Coliseum in Rome and the games of bringing, give them a circus.

05:47.796 --> 05:55.608
That freshman year, describe a typical class day routine for you.

05:55.668 --> 05:56.890
What time did you get up?

05:57.308 --> 05:59.511
Well, you know, you had Reveille.

06:00.112 --> 06:00.753
Did you guys?

06:01.775 --> 06:03.036
Sure you had Reveille.

06:03.076 --> 06:03.757
You know, there's a lot.

06:03.838 --> 06:05.240
Whose room did you take care of?

06:06.361 --> 06:13.311
Well, when I was over in the Corps, you know, whoever they assigned you to, and I was, come here.

06:13.732 --> 06:19.220
I'm sorry, I've got a dog that is a puppy that is acting upset.

06:19.941 --> 06:26.571
Okay, sit.

06:26.591 --> 06:26.691
Okay.

06:28.375 --> 06:50.603
There was, in our outfit, we had certain sand duties that we did, and, you know, all those things rotated around, and we lived right down by the crapper, and my job was to get in and, you know, tidy up the crappers every morning.

06:51.157 --> 06:56.222
Which, you know, I'd much rather do that than have some guy's room to take care of.

06:56.242 --> 06:59.185
Over in the dining hall, did your outfit have cush questions?

06:59.686 --> 07:00.126
Oh, yeah.

07:00.166 --> 07:02.529
You know, I mean, you didn't eat until everyone left the table.

07:02.549 --> 07:03.350
That was another thing.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.991
I was losing weight like crazy.

07:06.713 --> 07:09.436
And they said, boy, you know, you need to eat.

07:10.257 --> 07:15.122
And by the time, you know, everybody left, you got about that long to eat.

07:15.322 --> 07:17.785
What were some of your favorite Cush questions you remember?

07:17.886 --> 07:42.780
Oh, well, campusology was, you know, there were all kinds of things you had to recite and remember and recitations and how many steps led to this and, you know, what was the horse's name and, you know, all kinds of just bullshit that at night you're studying that so you can eat as opposed to studying freshman English or,

07:43.385 --> 07:48.143
Where did you and your buddies go when you had any unscheduled time during the day?

07:48.364 --> 07:49.508
What did y'all do?

07:49.528 --> 07:54.407
We went to the MSC in the spring, I mean in the summer,

07:54.893 --> 07:59.960
In May and September, for sure, the MSC, because it was the only air-conditioned building on campus.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.745
But during the rest of the time, what did you do if you had two hours free?

08:03.765 --> 08:07.009
If I had two hours free, the MSC was literally the living room of the campus.

08:07.090 --> 08:08.051
Everyone went over there.

08:08.071 --> 08:12.277
That's where I met J. Wayne Stark, and he had a big influence on my life.

08:12.497 --> 08:13.598
How so?

08:13.618 --> 08:20.648
Well, Stark was, Stark ran the only cultural oasis in a wasteland down there.

08:20.628 --> 08:25.092
And from the performing arts to the visual arts, there's always something going on over there.

08:25.512 --> 08:27.855
And there was some kind of an exhibit.

08:28.095 --> 08:36.322
And you could go down and bowl a game or get a good ping pong game going with someone or have a great bowl session.

08:36.362 --> 08:41.146
Did he ever give you a lecture on that green couch about doing your best?

08:41.387 --> 08:45.090
Oh, I don't think anyone ever worked in any of that stuff.

08:45.110 --> 08:48.253
And Stark and I got to be really close.

08:48.293 --> 08:50.635
And afterwards,

08:50.615 --> 08:56.982
When I was down at the University of Houston, I led the Houston delegation back down to Skona.

08:57.523 --> 09:03.489
And I hadn't participated in Skona when I was at A&M, but I did represent the University of Houston.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.413
And thank you, Nana.

09:08.395 --> 09:11.619
How did you and your buddies dress when you went to class?

09:12.640 --> 09:14.682
Fatigues, if we could get away with it.

09:15.404 --> 09:21.222
But you're supposed to be in uniform all the time.

09:21.242 --> 09:23.649
First year or two, did you attend class regularly?

09:24.111 --> 09:24.953
Oh, no.

09:25.334 --> 09:25.896
Where did you?

09:26.297 --> 09:29.768
Well, once I didn't have to go to practice,

09:30.760 --> 09:34.785
I would be on campus for the major quizzes.

09:35.986 --> 09:37.448
I was dating a girl in Austin.

09:37.588 --> 09:46.119
In fact, the state rep down there, he got me in trouble because he asked my father in Port Arthur how I was doing at the University of Texas.

09:46.179 --> 09:47.501
He said, well, I only have one son.

09:47.521 --> 09:48.402
He said, A&M.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.765
He said, well, I see him in Austin all the time.

09:54.930 --> 09:55.030
Yeah.

09:55.010 --> 10:02.741
I didn't have a car up there, but you could always find somebody that was dating a girl down there.

10:03.122 --> 10:09.231
I mean, there were cars going back and forth to Austin, to Waco, to Huntsville, to Houston.

10:10.032 --> 10:15.280
I mean, going somewhere because there's a certain...

10:15.260 --> 10:18.345
urges that make young men want to be where young women are.

10:18.545 --> 10:19.607
Did you hitchhike ever?

10:19.908 --> 10:20.809
Oh, absolutely.

10:20.889 --> 10:22.492
Describe Aggie hitchhiking.

10:22.512 --> 10:27.340
Well, you go out and hit the lion out there and line up and stick your thumb in.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.883
I hitchhiked all over the country.

10:28.983 --> 10:30.545
I've got a great hitchhiking story.

10:31.066 --> 10:38.899
The summer before I got in A&M when I wasn't at Junction, they had a big strike going to Port Arthur.

10:38.919 --> 10:40.542
They always had strikes.

10:40.910 --> 10:46.720
So my buddy Jack Clark, he went to Rice to play ball up there, but we ran around.

10:46.760 --> 10:53.091
In fact, my mother called me by my last name until her death to distinguish me from Jack Clark.

10:53.612 --> 11:01.226
She referred to us as our two Jacks, and he practices the law and lives not far from here, and we're still close friends.

11:01.907 --> 11:05.533
But Jack Clark and I said, well, we're going to hitchhike to

11:05.513 --> 11:28.585
California and get work out there and so we started hitchhiking and we had a we wound up I take it back it was after I guess it was my sophomore junior year because I had a freshman from Tucumcari New Mexico

11:30.674 --> 11:35.620
Charlie Preston, and we got to Amarillo where my brother was.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.482
My brother lived in Amarillo.

11:37.542 --> 11:38.383
We stayed with him.

11:39.224 --> 11:42.128
So I called Charlie Preston, who lived in Tucumcari.

11:42.148 --> 11:46.693
I said, we're coming that way, going out to California, and we're going to be on Route 66.

11:47.114 --> 11:48.636
He said, hell, I've got to come to Amarillo.

11:48.656 --> 11:50.157
So he came over and picked us up.

11:50.718 --> 11:53.982
We got to Tucumcari.

11:55.936 --> 12:00.663
We met some guys over there that would come back from California, so there's absolutely no jobs out there.

12:02.045 --> 12:11.480
So Clark said, well, hell, he had a guy that, because he had been at Rice, he had a guy named Kahn, K-A-H-N.

12:11.560 --> 12:16.628
He later became a beer distributor in El Paso and then up in Dallas.

12:17.418 --> 12:20.705
And we hitchhiked down to El Paso.

12:21.367 --> 12:24.253
We stayed with him a few days, couldn't get work down there.

12:24.313 --> 12:27.661
So we said, well, you know, we're going to starve to death out here.

12:27.721 --> 12:30.126
We better at least get back home where we can eat.

12:31.189 --> 12:32.872
So we started hitchhiking.

12:32.912 --> 12:35.899
I had my little ditty bag that had a Texas Aggie sticker on it.

12:36.841 --> 12:38.983
And, you know, I mean, you think nothing about it.

12:39.023 --> 12:44.288
We left home with like $5 each in our pocket and what we could get in that ditty bag and our thumb.

12:44.368 --> 12:46.129
And, you know, we were out to see the world.

12:47.230 --> 12:52.395
And we were out at $10, $2 out there, you know, in the great desert.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.158
And some guy comes highballing it through.

12:56.318 --> 12:57.580
And, I mean, he passed us.

12:57.620 --> 12:59.421
He must have been doing 90 miles an hour.

12:59.441 --> 13:01.263
And it took him a mile, I think.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.224
Shut that car down.

13:02.244 --> 13:04.806
When we started running, he started backing.

13:04.786 --> 13:07.290
And we got there, and I think his name was Roy.

13:07.410 --> 13:08.732
Clark still remembers his name.

13:08.752 --> 13:11.236
I think it was Roy Wilkins or something like that.

13:12.058 --> 13:15.263
I've tried several times to find him through all the former student stuff.

13:15.283 --> 13:16.605
We've never been able to run him down.

13:17.907 --> 13:24.638
He gave us a ride, and he said, well, boy, it's as far as I go.

13:24.678 --> 13:27.823
And we were out just still in the middle of nowhere.

13:28.394 --> 13:32.259
And he said, you're not going to get a ride because it's like 9 o'clock at night.

13:32.359 --> 13:34.201
He said, now you come on home with me.

13:34.261 --> 13:35.703
He said, I got a garage apartment.

13:35.743 --> 13:36.704
Y'all can stay out there.

13:37.645 --> 13:41.070
We got in and just fixed some sandwiches, went to bed.

13:41.090 --> 13:43.112
We had a place to sleep and a full belly.

13:43.933 --> 13:52.123
He got us up the next morning about 5 o'clock, and he took us down to a truck terminal where he knew the guy down there, and he said, these are pretty good boys.

13:52.103 --> 13:54.046
They had a rig that was going to Houston.

13:54.226 --> 13:59.895
We traveled on that rig all day, and we got into Houston out of the ship channel at 2 a.m.

14:00.656 --> 14:08.908
Guy dropped us off out there on the old 90 out in the middle of the, out by Channel View, and we started hijacking.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.310
Now we've been traveling a lot.

14:10.330 --> 14:11.412
We're getting foot weary.

14:11.830 --> 14:13.612
We finally got another truck fixed up.

14:13.672 --> 14:19.239
We got into Port Arthur at 530 on the outskirts of Port Arthur, and we walked in.

14:19.460 --> 14:24.406
We got to Clark's house at 7 o'clock, and his mother opened the back door in there.

14:24.426 --> 14:24.907
We stood.

14:24.927 --> 14:27.029
I guess we looked like death warmed over.

14:27.610 --> 14:29.272
She fed us, and I didn't even go home.

14:29.473 --> 14:31.375
I just walked in.

14:31.355 --> 14:36.823
crashed on the couch and she called my mother who came over to get me that afternoon.

14:37.384 --> 14:39.647
I've never been so tired in my life.

14:39.667 --> 14:43.253
Did you ever have a negative experience as an Aggie hitchhiker?

14:43.273 --> 14:43.934
Never.

14:44.354 --> 14:46.337
I had, you know, people would pick you up.

14:46.437 --> 14:53.047
You had that A&M sticker on there and they'd stop and pick you up and you just visited with everyone.

14:53.087 --> 14:54.549
I'd no more get out there on the road.

14:54.689 --> 14:56.292
I used to pick up hitchhikers too.

14:56.352 --> 14:57.193
I don't anymore.

14:57.815 --> 15:00.080
Okay, you're hitchhiking.

15:01.623 --> 15:03.628
You said no negative experiences.

15:04.550 --> 15:07.937
And what were the rules about Aggie hitchhiking?

15:09.139 --> 15:17.798
Well, if you were leaving from the campus, you know, you went down to the line, you got in line, and, you know, just every car came through loaded up on a Friday afternoon.

15:18.385 --> 15:24.512
If most of my hitchhiking was done out of Houston or Austin and you just, you went out there and got on the side of the road.

15:24.772 --> 15:27.375
Where in Houston was the best place to catch you?

15:27.715 --> 15:34.543
Out here on 290, just past Post Oak, what was Post Oak Road that's now 610.

15:35.424 --> 15:47.397
And the old Post Oak, the old Hempstead Highway is a few blocks from here and runs under, runs parallel to the railroad tracks that go down to College Station.

15:47.377 --> 15:53.108
All right, when you went from College Station to Port Arthur or vice versa, what route did you take?

15:53.248 --> 15:54.029
You couldn't get there.

15:54.089 --> 15:56.073
I mean, you had to have somebody.

15:56.634 --> 16:01.503
When I had a car, we came out of Port Arthur on 69 up through Beaumont.

16:01.523 --> 16:08.997
Then you went up to Cleveland and came across from Cleveland down in through Navasota and into College Station.

16:09.466 --> 16:14.754
Was it common when an Aggie rode with another Aggie who had a car?

16:15.114 --> 16:15.835
You shared.

16:15.855 --> 16:16.957
Everybody shared the cost.

16:17.097 --> 16:17.638
Sure.

16:17.718 --> 16:23.126
Gardner LaBeouf and Jack Harthorn and Sammy Meyer, we all went back and forth together a lot.

16:24.028 --> 16:31.619
Although I got to where I didn't like to go with LaBeouf because LaBeouf was crazy and we'd, you know, he'd get a six pack when we left Port Arthur.

16:32.420 --> 16:36.486
Well, we'd be out of beer by the time we got, there was a place up in East Texas

16:37.208 --> 16:50.650
up there somewhere around Cleveland, where out in the middle of nowhere where the county line was, just like the Whiskey Bridge was, you cross this line across, you know, some creek or river, and on the other side, well, all these beer joints.

16:50.670 --> 16:56.560
Well, everybody would get out, you know, relieve themselves, and we'd go in to get more beer.

16:57.322 --> 16:59.385
And LaBeouf would look around, and he'd say,

17:00.530 --> 17:02.654
You know, we can whip anybody's ass that's in here.

17:02.794 --> 17:10.608
And you had all these big old boys that, you know, didn't have anything to do but sit around up there and cut down trees and drink beer.

17:10.768 --> 17:13.573
And that was before you had power saws.

17:13.794 --> 17:15.497
They did all that with a crosscut.

17:15.938 --> 17:21.728
And if you ever spend any time on the end of a crosscut saw, you're either dead or you have one hell of a right hand.

17:21.708 --> 17:28.877
And the thing that you learned to do was always circle them so they couldn't get, so that right was going away from you.

17:29.338 --> 17:31.721
Because if they ever hit you with that right hand, they'd kill you.

17:33.283 --> 17:38.590
If you could ever get them to miss, you could get over the top of it, you know, you were okay.

17:38.610 --> 17:40.172
But God, help you.

17:40.332 --> 17:46.040
How easy was it for a person under age 21 to buy beer then?

17:46.480 --> 17:51.006
Well, you see in Port Arthur, the rules down there,

17:52.015 --> 18:04.653
On the main street of Port Arthur, you went into the Keyhole Club, and they had all the odds up on the wall, and it was open, and there was prostitution upstairs.

18:04.993 --> 18:09.239
So buying beer illegally was the least of the sins that went on there.

18:09.639 --> 18:14.166
Their rules were if you could reach the bar with 20 cents, they gave you a beer.

18:14.246 --> 18:19.373
Beer was 19 cents, and you were expected to leave the penny for the bartender.

18:19.353 --> 18:22.578
Back on the campus.

18:22.698 --> 18:26.604
And, of course, you go to Louisiana and it was legal then, you see.

18:26.624 --> 18:33.434
But you didn't, legal niceties were not closely observed as they are now.

18:33.454 --> 18:37.180
Back on the campus, you got there in the fall of 56.

18:38.863 --> 18:41.266
About how long was it before you went home the first time?

18:41.847 --> 18:42.508
Thanksgiving?

18:43.113 --> 18:45.878
Yeah, Thanksgiving was the first time I went home.

18:45.978 --> 18:53.651
I dated that girl down in Texas, and we went down to Austin and whipped their ass, and she had a car, and I rode home with her.

18:54.252 --> 18:57.357
That was probably one of the highlights of my entire life.

18:57.717 --> 19:01.584
What did you tell your folks about what it was like to be an Aggie?

19:02.525 --> 19:05.290
Well, Mother was very proud of me.

19:05.894 --> 19:15.028
She said, you know, when you were born, we were in a garage apartment in Waco, Texas, and there was the Kendricks family who owned the house.

19:15.248 --> 19:16.050
He was an Aggie.

19:17.171 --> 19:28.329
And they had a son at the same time named Gid, and Gid Kendrick and I played together, and evidently he brainwashed my mother about how great A&M was.

19:28.389 --> 19:31.193
Now my father, on the other hand, who had not attended college,

19:31.730 --> 19:36.882
He had one teacher in Malone, Texas from the time he started school, he graduated.

19:38.024 --> 19:43.276
And she went on to Baylor and became the dean of women there, Dr. Lorena Stretch.

19:43.376 --> 19:44.820
I don't know if you ever ran across her.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.664
She was kind of a legend down in Baylor.

19:46.824 --> 19:50.312
Well, when I was a boy, we always made this pilgrimage to see Dr. Stretch.

19:51.946 --> 20:00.175
But Dad had been working in Waco before he and Mother married when A&M played Waco and they had a big riot.

20:00.235 --> 20:02.498
They never finished the second half of the game.

20:02.898 --> 20:05.521
Well, his sympathies lay with the Baylor Bears.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.143
He always pulled for Baylor.

20:07.664 --> 20:12.889
My brother, who is 12 years older, came back from World War II, he went and graduated from Baylor.

20:13.350 --> 20:15.152
Baylor was my father's school.

20:15.132 --> 20:24.753
And he, you know, wanted me to go anywhere except Texas A&M University, the one school he despised, one school mother really liked.

20:25.074 --> 20:31.909
They both agreed they didn't think Texas was the right place for me because it was a rich kid's school, and we weren't rich.

20:34.167 --> 20:44.160
As you look back on it, did you have some teachers that first semester or first year at A&M that were important to you?

20:45.582 --> 20:54.994
Well, all of them were important because I was, you know, that's when you had all these freshman courses, you know, you had

20:54.974 --> 21:09.174
It seemed like 1,000 people in a biology class and 1,000 people in this, and you had, they, Kutesh and Denton got me in, you know, you had to have so many science credits, and they got me in rocks for jocks, which, you know, they.

21:10.115 --> 21:10.576
Who taught that?

21:11.176 --> 21:13.139
I can't remember, you know.

21:13.159 --> 21:14.641
Was it supposedly an easy course?

21:14.701 --> 21:19.648
Yeah, but they taught you how to lick the rocks and what they tasted like, you could identify them.

21:19.628 --> 21:25.261
And Kutash and Denton had some unique ways of helping you.

21:25.722 --> 21:36.608
But my first, the profs that really had an influence on me,

21:36.588 --> 21:40.451
Scoot ran the business school.

21:41.612 --> 21:43.494
And... Where's his last name?

21:43.514 --> 21:44.375
Scooter Harrison.

21:44.535 --> 21:45.656
No, it's not Scooter Harrison.

21:46.457 --> 21:49.920
Scooter... No, that's a new nickname.

21:50.260 --> 21:54.604
Well, he was before... He was dean of the business school.

21:54.644 --> 21:55.925
We were in Francis Hall.

21:56.926 --> 22:05.413
And... But they had an old alcoholic judge who was a lawyer who taught business law.

22:06.102 --> 22:11.982
They had a three-fingered dozer, and he taught some courses over there.

22:12.163 --> 22:12.404
B.J.

22:12.504 --> 22:12.906
Adams?

22:13.628 --> 22:14.792
Adams was there.

22:14.812 --> 22:16.197
I was trying to think who else was there.

22:16.868 --> 22:19.292
And got taught salesmanship.

22:21.376 --> 22:23.700
And was business your major from the first?

22:23.940 --> 22:26.505
Yeah, I wanted to go to law school.

22:26.745 --> 22:27.366
So that was?

22:27.787 --> 22:30.632
Yeah, and I wanted to get a business degree and eventually go to law school.

22:30.652 --> 22:31.533
That was my dream.

22:32.174 --> 22:32.375
Right.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.799
That and flying airplanes in the Air Force.

22:34.819 --> 22:34.999
Right.

22:35.180 --> 22:37.604
I was really more interested in flying airplanes in the Air Force.

22:37.644 --> 22:39.467
I thought I might make that a career.

22:39.447 --> 22:43.277
That first semester, do you remember going to Silver Taps?

22:43.739 --> 22:44.862
Oh, yeah.

22:44.882 --> 22:45.403
You know, you.

22:45.724 --> 22:48.010
Describe what that was.

22:48.471 --> 22:54.267
Well, we got there, and of course, you know, you had campusology and this, that, and the other, and, you know, you knew what it was.

22:55.597 --> 23:04.490
There was a kid, there were two core areas, the new core area and the old core area, and I was over in the new core area when I was in the core.

23:04.530 --> 23:06.753
I mean, it was like the first week or so we were there.

23:07.414 --> 23:12.481
And some kid was driving back, went to sleep in the car, and you know, bam.

23:12.501 --> 23:14.064
Aggies used to die like flies.

23:14.464 --> 23:19.832
The percentage, you know, there's more Aggies now, but the percentage of the student body

23:19.812 --> 23:24.158
because everyone was traveling everywhere, you know, all the time.

23:24.779 --> 23:25.760
Just greater odds.

23:28.003 --> 23:41.902
So they said it's going to be Silver Taps tonight, and they called, you know, the outfit together and said, you know, freshman, this is first Silver Taps, you know, you know, this is a very serious thing, and it's one of our greatest traditions.

23:42.643 --> 23:45.887
You know, I outlined it all, and so it, uh,

23:47.251 --> 23:51.618
The guys just walked down the hall and said, fall out for silver taps.

23:52.319 --> 23:59.030
Well, you know, I thought maybe we marched over, you know, I'd never, we hadn't gotten into the mechanics.

23:59.571 --> 24:13.714
You're used to falling out every one while, catting and lining up and all this noise, and suddenly it's dark, and people are just filing out, and I wrote a poem that night when I got back.

24:14.926 --> 24:17.033
I can remember the first few.

24:17.514 --> 24:28.227
They shuffled along in streams, and the streams became rivers, and the rivers flowed into a silent sea that stood and stared at nothing.

24:31.868 --> 24:34.491
And that was, you know, the impression that I had.

24:35.091 --> 24:36.813
And you and your buddies took it seriously?

24:37.454 --> 24:38.655
Oh, very seriously.

24:38.675 --> 24:42.079
And nobody played any jokes after it was over or anything like that?

24:42.099 --> 24:42.799
Absolutely not.

24:43.020 --> 24:47.945
I mean, that was a, it was a very somber, solemn occasion.

24:47.965 --> 24:53.891
Well, I went back and put pen to paper, which you're running a risk and anything, every light's out.

24:53.951 --> 24:58.095
But I spent most of my life running a risk.

24:58.115 --> 24:59.597
I felt compelled to.

25:00.742 --> 25:02.048
required my impression.

25:03.032 --> 25:08.997
Not that it was great prose, but it was something that I wanted to do.

25:09.550 --> 25:12.093
Another tradition, then, would be bonfire.

25:12.193 --> 25:13.695
Did you, as a fish?

25:13.715 --> 25:13.995
Oh, yeah.

25:14.295 --> 25:15.937
Everybody participated in the bonfire.

25:15.957 --> 25:18.139
When I was there, athletes participated in everything.

25:18.199 --> 25:19.821
I mean, it was— What did you do as a fish?

25:20.082 --> 25:24.226
Well, first thing, you know, you went out to the cutting area, and— Do you remember where it was?

25:24.747 --> 25:25.027
No.

25:25.327 --> 25:29.612
Hell, you just, you know, you got in the back of a truck, and it's hard to tell where you're going looking backwards.

25:30.713 --> 25:34.157
And, you know, you went out to the cutting area, and—

25:34.137 --> 25:42.693
they had these sticks that the first letter began with an F, and which were young saplings.

25:42.713 --> 25:53.513
And, you know, the freshman, you start off, you know, your jobs, they put those on the logs, you get there and, you know, the one, two, three, uh, well,

25:54.202 --> 25:58.566
I never could have enough sense to get next to some guy that was my size.

25:58.606 --> 26:01.669
I always had some guy that couldn't reach the sticks.

26:01.709 --> 26:04.332
So basically, you're toting one side of it.

26:04.352 --> 26:06.914
You got a little guy hopping along besides you getting underfoot.

26:07.755 --> 26:13.501
And then the other things, once they found out, you know, I'd spent all my summers in East Texas.

26:14.602 --> 26:21.188
And I started on a crosscut saw when I was, you know, a little boy.

26:22.028 --> 26:24.311
And I knew how to use an axe and a crosscut.

26:24.431 --> 26:27.536
And there were, you know, everything was done by hand back then.

26:27.656 --> 26:35.006
And so once they discovered that you had a talent for those things, they quickly moved you into another line of work out there.

26:35.787 --> 26:41.134
And, which I enjoy, you know, using a crosscut's rhythm.

26:41.502 --> 26:47.153
You know, you get going if you got a good partner on the other side, you can really make that thing hum.

26:47.173 --> 26:51.001
About how long did y'all work on the bonfire?

26:51.021 --> 26:59.097
Well, if you had afternoon classes off, you know, they, you'd take off and go out and work in the afternoon, and then you'd come back, you know, for chow.

26:59.438 --> 27:02.143
And then how many, but how many days or weeks?

27:02.900 --> 27:06.665
Well, it seemed like bonfire went on forever then, and then it started raining.

27:06.705 --> 27:10.329
It always rained during bonfire, and you were just mucking around out there.

27:10.830 --> 27:21.764
And once you got out of the cutting area and you got everything into the stack area and, you know, you started up, it was, it was, the logistics were easier because if you had an hour off, you know, they'd clean the darms out.

27:21.804 --> 27:24.628
Somebody would be, you know, they'd just, they'd send people through the darms.

27:25.228 --> 27:27.571
You know, if you had a quiz, you know, forget that quiz, man.

27:27.611 --> 27:28.793
We got a bonfire to build.

27:29.654 --> 27:31.236
Now, you went out there riding a truck?

27:31.688 --> 27:34.271
Well, that was when you go to the cutting areas.

27:34.291 --> 27:34.972
That's what I mean.

27:35.492 --> 27:35.592
Yeah.

27:35.613 --> 27:39.937
And you went, you know, there were places where there were pickup points.

27:40.498 --> 27:49.529
Your job was to, you know, get in your combat boots and get in your grubbies and get over there and get at that pickup point and go out.

27:49.789 --> 27:54.975
Did anybody during your years at A&M, did anybody seriously get injured during that?

27:54.995 --> 27:55.395
Oh, yeah.

27:55.415 --> 27:55.676
Sure.

27:56.016 --> 27:56.937
How seriously?

27:57.423 --> 28:04.130
Well, he dropped a tree on one kid, and the trunk didn't hit him, but some major branches did.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.905
Everybody ran over there, and we were cutting him out.

28:08.172 --> 28:14.040
And I was with guys when I said, you know, I'm screaming, wait, you know, everybody's running in here with us.

28:14.761 --> 28:18.126
You know, don't, we're going to decapitate this guy.

28:18.146 --> 28:20.169
You know, get a cross cut in, cut this one.

28:20.690 --> 28:22.332
That's when I got on the cutting.

28:23.273 --> 28:27.579
You know, some upperclassmen said, there is a guy that knows what he's doing.

28:27.599 --> 28:28.240
But it didn't kill him.

28:28.521 --> 28:29.041
It didn't kill him.

28:29.081 --> 28:29.642
He was hurt.

28:30.123 --> 28:33.167
He had, you know, he's just beat all to hell.

28:33.147 --> 28:37.333
And he had, I think, a broken arm or something like that.

28:37.353 --> 28:37.874
Scared him.

28:37.934 --> 28:39.676
I mean, a damn tree falls on you.

28:39.997 --> 28:40.938
I'd have died of fright.

28:41.159 --> 28:43.822
Now, in those days, Bonfire was on the drill field.

28:44.143 --> 28:45.605
Right, behind Duncan Messonk.

28:46.086 --> 28:50.853
What kind of jokes or pranks did you guys play during Bonfire time?

28:50.873 --> 29:00.066
Well, you know, there were, it was kind of a, you know, you've had a lot of discipline, so everybody's lots looser and, you know,

29:00.687 --> 29:05.195
There's more camaraderie between the classes than there were at other times.

29:05.236 --> 29:06.077
Nobody got drunk.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.205
None of us could afford to get drunk back then.

29:10.225 --> 29:17.278
I mean, you drank on a weekend, but there was no, maybe some of them did.

29:18.153 --> 29:21.778
I just didn't see a lot of drinking except on the weekends.

29:21.958 --> 29:27.346
And, you know, you worked hard and then you played hard.

29:27.867 --> 29:33.996
And the bonfire during your years, nobody ever successfully bombed it or?

29:34.897 --> 29:35.858
Well, hell no.

29:36.299 --> 29:37.961
We had some kids were hurt.

29:38.061 --> 29:41.967
Someone drove a car through a checkpoint and hurt some kids.

29:43.212 --> 29:46.177
And there was rumor that that was somebody coming to burn.

29:46.558 --> 29:50.024
But I never separated the fact from the fiction on all that.

29:50.504 --> 29:55.693
I mean, a guy would have to be absolutely out of his mind to try to get in and set that bonfire on fire.

29:55.994 --> 29:59.820
Why is bonfire important to Aggie traditions?

29:59.840 --> 30:03.727
Well, again, it's a shared experience.

30:04.067 --> 30:07.954
It's a coming together of a group of people

30:10.280 --> 30:17.718
You know, I thought about Bonfire watching the rescue effort in New York, because it's that same thing.

30:17.818 --> 30:25.437
People that are not firemen, not cops, just, I want to do something.

30:25.417 --> 30:31.288
Okay, then let's go to your freshman year, go to Aggie football game.

30:31.328 --> 30:33.592
Was that, had you ever been to an Aggie game before?

30:33.913 --> 30:39.703
Well, you know, I told you about coming down to Rice to see how you didn't play Rice, but I hadn't been on campus.

30:40.104 --> 30:45.113
So what, describe a football Saturday for a freshman.

30:45.093 --> 30:54.249
You know, I wanted to watch the football game, and you're, you know, if you're sitting with a court, it's a hard place to watch a football game because you're supposed to be doing something all the time.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.694
And you've got to date if you're lucky.

30:58.135 --> 31:00.339
And I always dated girls.

31:00.419 --> 31:06.409
One of my prerequisites, I couldn't date a girl unless she had her own car because she had to come up and bring her car.

31:07.491 --> 31:08.653
And...

31:08.633 --> 31:14.666
So you've got a date up there that's got a car, and you know you're going to go out and do a little heavy necking.

31:14.686 --> 31:15.989
And I was interested.

31:16.009 --> 31:23.466
The football game first, the girls second, and all the stuff that the Corps was doing was third, and I was constantly getting in trouble.

31:23.867 --> 31:25.731
Fish rains, hump it down there.

31:26.814 --> 31:28.397
Pass those yells back.
