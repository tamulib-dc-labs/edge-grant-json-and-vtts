WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:20.429
We

00:00.031 --> 00:20.429
were talking about the trolley

00:00.031 --> 00:20.429
coming in from Bryan and I believe you mentioned on 
busy days they pulled a trailer. Where did they

00:21.010 --> 00:22.631
store that trailer? In Bryan just east of the 
Location of the Brown Eagle,

00:30.507 --> 00:36.557
where the Brown Eagle is at present.

00:39.122 --> 00:42.748
Do you remember how long that trolley continued to 
run? I do not recall. I know it was after you

00:45.913 --> 00:48.398
graduated. I thought maybe since you had remained 
in the area, you would have perhaps remembered.

00:54.268 --> 00:55.570
But that's a, it's not. I remember when it 
discontinued, but I don't recall the year. OK.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.214
Were there other things that students did? We've 
talked about going to Bryan. We've talked about

01:15.656 --> 01:24.831
the movies, that there was a swimming pool in

01:15.656 --> 01:24.831
Hawaii. There were sports, intramural sports or 
battalion sports. What about inside their

01:30.427 --> 01:32.492
dormitories? I know that they had a quiet hour 
during the evening when they had to study, but

01:34.476 --> 01:42.634
during the day, did they do anything inside for 
entertainment?

01:51.878 --> 01:57.125
I don't recall, except perhaps card games, a few.

02:02.732 --> 02:04.394
Some did a lot of sleeping, of course. I had one 
roommate who had that reputation, but I guess

02:06.257 --> 02:15.068
that's what caused me to think about that. Well, I 
know when I was in school, there were a number of

02:16.853 --> 02:22.037
boys who did a fair amount of sleeping during the 
afternoons. Of course, at that point, they could

02:22.618 --> 02:30.725
do carousing at night, but I imagine you were 
controlled, so you really couldn't do much

02:22.618 --> 02:30.725
carousing at night. It seems to me that the study 
was from 7.30 until

02:30.745 --> 02:38.531
11 o'clock. Taps are 11 o'clock. Did you not have 
a... tattoo and then a free period of a few minutes

02:46.958 --> 02:50.704
and then taps, or? Yes. You had that, huh? Okay, so 
that was primarily kind of a preliminary warning

02:55.811 --> 03:01.940
that it was about time to go to bed, is that it? 
That's right. Okay. Did you have any favorite

03:07.068 --> 03:10.373
instructors during your student days? And if so, 
who were they and why?

03:18.464 --> 03:23.271
Dr. Silvey, to me, was one of the outstanding 
instructors. He was head of physics department,

03:23.311 --> 03:30.281
and I was fortunate in having him. But I had many 
good instructors, I thought. And

03:35.329 --> 03:47.847
in veterinary medicine, of course. after I came 
back in the fall of 23 to take veterinary medicine,

03:48.383 --> 04:00.293
I thought Dr. Francis and Dr. Leonard were 
outstanding as instructors.

04:06.199 --> 04:08.461
You mentioned coming back to vet medicine.

04:11.063 --> 04:16.888
Before I finished, Dr. Biltsing, head of 
entomology, I thought was an excellent

04:11.063 --> 04:16.888
instructor.

04:20.733 --> 04:33.066
Mr. Stangle, frequently

04:20.733 --> 04:33.066
called Runt Stangle, who is a retired dean of 
agriculture at Texas Tech, was outstanding.

04:36.469 --> 04:37.290
There were many others.

04:40.593 --> 04:47.280
What I was about to ask, at what point did you decide 
to go on for your degree in vet medicine?

04:52.492 --> 05:07.672
I had a course under Dr. Francis in

04:52.492 --> 05:07.672
my junior year in animal husbandry and a course 
under Dr. Marsteller and Dr. Leonard in my senior

04:52.492 --> 05:07.672
year. Those courses

05:09.234 --> 05:19.647
caused me to think that I would like to. take 
veterinary medicine mainly as a good combination

05:20.808 --> 05:30.440
with animal husbandry,

05:20.808 --> 05:30.440
especially the course of Dr. Francis.

05:36.568 --> 05:50.005
Then I finished in January 1926 and went to 
Beaumont until September the 10th, 1926.

05:51.048 --> 05:56.193
You received your bachelor's in the spring of 23, 
right? That's right, May 19, 23. And came back the

05:58.556 --> 06:01.679
following fall and enrolled in vet medicine. 
That's right. Did you have to apply well in advance

06:03.561 --> 06:10.489
for vet medicine, or was there not the competition 
then as there is now? Well, I don't know whether

06:12.050 --> 06:19.198
I've gotten in on the present conditions, but, 
requirements, but No, I don't recall

06:20.613 --> 06:29.389
writing about it. I just came in. I knew that they 
would like to have some students.

06:40.669 --> 06:45.237
I didn't have any difficulty at all.

06:49.672 --> 06:55.019
Okay, let's get back to your undergraduate day for 
a minute. We know that a lot of students had

06:55.520 --> 07:00.105
part-time employment while they were here. Did 
you have any jobs of any sort? Not while I was taking

07:04.111 --> 07:06.193
animal husbandry. I did work and lived at the 
veterinary hospital

07:06.293 --> 07:19.290
from 1925-26.

07:21.228 --> 07:26.053
So one year you lived in the hospital and worked 
there? From

07:26.333 --> 07:36.723
June 1924 through January 1926. At

07:36.844 --> 07:49.416
the point that you were in the school of vet 
medicine, were their semesters the same as the

07:36.844 --> 07:49.416
rest of the college? Yes. Okay, so you had summer 
off then? Yes. Did you have employment during the

07:56.699 --> 07:58.601
summers?

08:01.584 --> 08:21.424
Well, in the summer of, I worked at home

08:01.584 --> 08:21.424
in the, except the summer of 21, I worked for 
Lackawanna Farms owned by Frank Schofield at

08:01.584 --> 08:21.424
Hillsboro on a shorthand. farm. It was a show herd. 
I worked up there to gain some experience.

08:35.995 --> 08:43.626
The other summers I worked at home on the

08:35.995 --> 08:43.626
farm.

08:50.695 --> 08:52.137
One of the things that I have felt that makes Texas 
A&M a somewhat unique institution of the

08:52.488 --> 09:10.504
traditions that are carried on by the student 
body, and now I suppose more by the Corps of Cadets

08:52.488 --> 09:10.504
than anybody else. I think of things like y'all 
practice, silver taps, bonfire, such things as

09:10.524 --> 09:17.711
that. Did you have these things during your 
student days? Yes. We had silver taps and we had

09:24.790 --> 09:27.093
bonfires. Where was the bonfire at the time you 
were a student? Held in the center of the, what we

09:33.341 --> 09:43.214
called the old drill field out in front of the MSC, 
between MSC and Law and Prairie. Was that all four

09:43.875 --> 09:45.136
years? Yes. What was the nature of the bonfire at 
that point? What kind of materials did you make it

09:50.977 --> 09:55.003
out of? A little of everything, but not on the big 
scale that they do now.

10:03.596 --> 10:08.203
Was it done primarily by the freshmen, or did 
everybody pitch in and do some of it? No, I think all

10:08.323 --> 10:11.888
the classes helped on it.

10:15.393 --> 10:19.279
But it was a very small-scale affair, more of a 
trash fire. A big bonfire. Well, but even then it

10:21.080 --> 10:25.027
was for the University of Texas at Thanksgiving. 
That is right. Preceded the University of Texas.

10:30.295 --> 10:31.477
What about a muster? Did you have a muster on campus 
during your student days? Not that I recall.

10:51.710 --> 10:56.297
I noted in your senior yearbook that you were 
president of the Turkey Trot Club. What was that

10:58.280 --> 11:00.102
organization? Of course, being from Cuero, we 
were known as, that's where the original Turkey

11:01.825 --> 11:11.099
Trot was held, and the first one was held in 1912. 
It's just the name of the county or the A&M Club. It

11:21.325 --> 11:24.910
was actually a DeWitt County club. So it was a 
hometown club? Yes, a hometown club.

11:50.067 --> 11:50.387
So you indicated you finished your vet medicine 
degree in January? January 1926. 1926.

12:01.247 --> 12:03.449
Did you join the faculty here immediately then? 
No, I went to Beaumont where I was in veterinary

12:03.789 --> 12:11.437
practice with Dr. J.G. Kerr.

12:15.841 --> 12:16.442
For how long? until September the 10th. I was 
supposed to

12:20.531 --> 12:34.427
start here in September the 1st, but Dr. Kerr was on 
vacation, the first vacation he had taken in

12:20.531 --> 12:34.427
years, and I didn't want to interrupt that. I had 
had a letter from Dr. Francis

12:34.447 --> 12:42.756
in the middle of August. He had a resignation. in 
the staff and asked if I was interested. He said,

12:51.910 --> 12:56.635
don't use the telephone. He, of course, was hard of 
hearing. So I got busy. I was going from 5 or 6 in the

13:03.721 --> 13:09.307
morning till 11 o'clock at night. And then I had a 
telephone call from Dr. Marsteller asking me when

13:09.487 --> 13:15.893
I was going to answer that letter. Or when I 
decided, I said, I'm not qualified, Dr.

13:16.767 --> 13:21.152
Marsteller. I'd like to take some graduate work. 
And I'd like to take it for about three years.

13:29.581 --> 13:34.386
And

13:29.581 --> 13:34.386
so he said, well, I'll tell the dean. And I said, 
well, I'll get a note off time. And after he talked

13:39.852 --> 13:41.494
to me. So I've been here ever since. How did you 
resolve your feeling that you weren't qualified

13:46.585 --> 13:56.060
and your decision finally to accept the position? 
Well, I took some

13:57.402 --> 14:12.205
summers off and went to Iowa State, what is now Iowa 
State University at Ames and the University of

13:57.402 --> 14:12.205
Chicago. the University of Michigan and the 
University of Texas, and took some specialized

14:13.737 --> 14:20.244
courses. In vet medicine? No. At

14:23.087 --> 14:38.745
Iowa State, I took poisonous plants and physical 
chemistry

14:23.087 --> 14:38.745
and the biochemistry that was offered to 
veterinary students.

14:41.428 --> 14:43.170
They had a summer class that year.

14:45.985 --> 14:55.999
And the physical chemistry was really 
biophysical, which I used a great deal after I came

14:45.985 --> 14:55.999
back.

14:59.724 --> 15:09.057
At the University of Michigan, I took courses in 
physiology

14:59.724 --> 15:09.057
and physiological chemistry, those two courses.

15:16.327 --> 15:27.858
At the University of Chicago, I took physiology

15:16.327 --> 15:27.858
and biochemistry.

15:32.303 --> 15:36.287
At the University of Texas, I took physics. Having 
had physics here with Dr. Silvey, I thought

15:36.307 --> 15:44.595
perhaps that I was going a little bit too strong in 
biochemistry for our physiology students, and I

15:45.824 --> 16:09.655
decided I'd take a course in physics

15:45.824 --> 16:09.655
to see if there were any new developments so that I 
wouldn't lean too heavily on the chemistry part.

16:10.937 --> 16:14.802
After all, physiology is a combination of physics 
and chemistry. that's applied, physics and

16:15.271 --> 16:17.695
chemistry.

16:23.685 --> 16:34.343
I still didn't think I had enough graduate work, 
but I got too busy.

16:38.002 --> 16:46.734
I believe, what, you've been here, what, nine 
years when you became head of the, no, yeah, head of

16:38.002 --> 16:46.734
the department and professor. 35, yes. In 
veterinary physiology and pharmacology. That's

16:51.621 --> 16:53.404
right. And you held that position until you 
retired then in 67.

16:59.953 --> 17:02.858
Well, I was head until through 1966. Uh-huh. And 
then I was a professor in the department from

17:05.120 --> 17:18.336
September 1, 1966 through August 31, 1967. So you 
stepped down as head and taught one more year. Yes.

17:24.183 --> 17:29.589
As head of the department, how much teaching did 
you do?

17:29.609 --> 17:31.291
I don't recall the number of hours. In some cases, 
over 20 hours. sometimes with as many as four

17:35.393 --> 17:37.476
courses. We had heavy teaching loads.

17:43.366 --> 17:51.819
With a smaller... And later on, as I got help, the 
first help I got was in 1936.

17:54.223 --> 18:02.937
And

17:54.223 --> 18:02.937
then when I retired in 66, I think there were Four of 
us, as I recall. So the department grew from one to

18:07.800 --> 18:09.683
four? Oh yes, now it's about 15 or 16 of them. Oh 
gracious. Has the student body increased that

18:15.250 --> 18:20.756
much since 67 to justify that? Well, they've gone 
from 64 students to 128. So it's doubled. Yes.

18:29.367 --> 18:31.810
In just, since 66?

18:35.857 --> 18:46.132
At least more

18:35.857 --> 18:46.132
than double, I'd say.

18:47.875 --> 19:03.158
What I was starting to say earlier, since you have a 
smaller student body in the School of Appomattox

18:47.875 --> 19:03.158
and now the College of Appomattox, and you did not 
have as much administrative responsibility,

18:47.875 --> 19:03.158
say, as the head of the Department of Civil 
Engineering. Oh, no, far from it. If a

19:05.607 --> 19:19.987
student in medicine, does he major in one of the 
departments in the school or college? No, not

19:21.629 --> 19:29.620
through the three

19:21.629 --> 19:29.620
years of trimesters. No, there's no 
specialization. Specialization.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.467
Specialization will come only in graduate work. 
In other words, if he would come back for a PhD in vet

19:34.868 --> 19:51.870
medicine, then he would come back for, say, a PhD 
major in physiology and pharmacology or

19:34.868 --> 19:51.870
veterinary surgery? Well, it's physiology and 
toxicology now. Toxicology is handled in the

19:55.514 --> 19:59.880
physiology department.

20:00.670 --> 20:04.534
There's a Ph.D. in Physiology and there's a Ph.D. 
in Toxicology.

20:10.380 --> 20:21.932
And then they have Ph.D.s in the other 
departments, Anatomy and Microbiology,

20:10.380 --> 20:21.932
Pathology, Public Health. But when you joined the 
Vet Medicine faculty in 26, you were the only one in

20:27.653 --> 20:30.337
the area of physiology and pharmacology. 
Correct. And you remained that for ten years,

20:31.238 --> 20:34.722
right? I believe you said in 1936 you finally got 
some help.

20:52.166 --> 20:56.091
That's

20:52.166 --> 20:56.091
right. Let me start all over again.

21:02.167 --> 21:16.703
When you, particularly in your early years of 
teaching, did you have some research

21:02.167 --> 21:16.703
responsibilities in addition to your teaching 
load? No. What about during the summers? Did you do

21:19.366 --> 21:20.327
research then? Yes, yes we could. We had courses 
sometimes offered in the summer. One summer, I

21:31.767 --> 21:43.257
taught a course for Dr. Francis and two

21:31.767 --> 21:43.257
students, a course on anatomy and physiology. 
This would be not medicine students. No. This

21:47.740 --> 21:55.727
would be like animal husbandry or students in 
Texas A&M College. As opposed to the School of Vet

21:56.163 --> 21:57.905
Medicine? That's right, service courses. 
Uh-huh. Did, while you were... However, we had

22:04.011 --> 22:09.417
some courses offered in the summer for repeaters.

22:13.301 --> 22:15.223
I do not recall how many. I think it took five to get a 
course in the summertime. We had some summer

22:20.709 --> 22:23.352
classes that way. That would have been fairly 
infrequent, though, I take it. Yes.

22:36.163 --> 22:40.830
Well, let me back this up again. You mentioned 
earlier having like maybe as many as 20 hours of

22:40.850 --> 22:45.777
teaching load. More than 20. More than 20. How much 
of that was in the School of Vet Medicine and how

22:47.740 --> 22:52.967
much of that was to undergraduates?

22:55.107 --> 22:56.769
Most of it in veterinary medicine. I had

22:57.209 --> 23:03.036
one service course for animal husbandry 
students.

23:06.621 --> 23:19.596
And then

23:06.621 --> 23:19.596
Dr. Ball wanted to offer a course in physiology for 
biology majors and pre-med students.

23:22.107 --> 23:26.130
And we had a double entry on those two courses, 341, 
342. They were in biology 341, biology 342. And the

23:31.095 --> 23:36.019
same course was VPP 341, VPP 342. But I did the 
teaching entirely, except one year, I think that

23:37.180 --> 23:46.588
was in 32, I believe, John Milliff handled it that 
year.

23:50.431 --> 23:51.692
And then...

23:54.693 --> 24:07.795
When Penberthy came here in the fall of 26,

23:54.693 --> 24:07.795
they got interested in developing a curriculum 
for physical education.

24:10.761 --> 24:20.397
And Mr. Friely, who was registrar and dean of the 
graduate college, asked me to work up a course

24:22.975 --> 24:29.661
And I work up the course, and

24:22.975 --> 24:29.661
he said, now will you teach it?

24:32.624 --> 24:40.291
So I fell out to the physical ed, the way I handled 
it. We signed them up for 341.

24:44.275 --> 24:47.278
And then they would drop out after one semester. 
And then the science students and pre-med

24:47.378 --> 24:52.543
students would continue into 342.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.042
So that didn't make it so hard. Did you continue 
teaching in both medicine students and

24:58.165 --> 25:05.957
undergraduates through your whole career?

25:09.022 --> 25:10.143
That's right. Right. However, in the last few 
years, I handled the animal husbandry, the

25:12.667 --> 25:23.644
service course to animal husbandry majors and 
dairy science majors and poultry science majors.

25:25.801 --> 25:27.963
and the course in toxicology.

25:32.929 --> 25:51.010
I think the last course in veterinary physiology I 
handled was to the class that graduated in 53

25:32.929 --> 25:51.010
or 54, something like that. Is that a general 
practice throughout the current College of Vet

25:55.771 --> 26:06.046
Medicine that people out there teach both vet 
students and undergraduates? Not necessarily,

26:06.066 --> 26:07.167
no. Some of them teach solely veterinary 
students.

26:12.235 --> 26:18.083
In the physiology department, for example, I 
think Dr. Claiborne handles the ag students.

26:21.648 --> 26:24.833
And some of them teach pharmacology alone. And

26:26.281 --> 26:36.712
some teach only physiology and have several in 
that category. Well, of course, with the

26:36.732 --> 26:48.044
tremendous growth in

26:36.732 --> 26:48.044
student enrollment, why I think this probably 
permits more specialization of the faculty. It's

26:48.344 --> 26:49.966
much better now than it used to be. And you 
mentioned earlier there were

26:56.369 --> 27:01.294
Did you say a hundred and how many students?

27:01.955 --> 27:03.316
We went from 64 to 128. And then

27:03.637 --> 27:13.647
do you have people working on a PhD in vet medicine 
in addition to that? Oh yes,

27:15.249 --> 27:20.695
they are not counted in that 128. Those are the ones 
who enter on the trimester basis. Working on their

27:26.137 --> 27:29.483
PhD, they would work on the semester basis. I see. 
They enrolled through the regular graduate

27:31.487 --> 27:34.011
school? Yes. I see. Okay.

27:42.808 --> 27:47.436
We teach the service courses like town husbandry. 
or Animal Science now. That's on a semester basis.

27:52.333 --> 27:54.437
I teach on semester and trimester both. So you kind 
of have to keep your time straight. That's right.

27:59.725 --> 28:05.975
And graduate courses on semester.

28:06.416 --> 28:13.086
Are your service courses that you taught for both 
graduates and undergraduates?

28:18.027 --> 28:36.798
Yes, I had a graduate course on

28:18.027 --> 28:36.798
several occasions, but most of them were 
undergraduates.

28:36.818 --> 28:41.706
I had an old newspaper clipping, I think, about the 
time you retired. I think it was a write-up about a

28:42.277 --> 29:00.437
party which they gave for you, and I believe I've 
got this quoted fairly directly here that said,

28:42.277 --> 29:00.437
you were best known for development of toxicology 
through which you made national contributions

28:42.277 --> 29:00.437
and designed a reference system made available to 
students. What kind of reference system was this?

29:08.106 --> 29:09.988
Mainly a card index file. that was free for 
students to use. And they would come in and use it.

29:19.963 --> 29:21.144
They were free to use it. I had it on my desk. They 
were as free to use it as I was. This would be a file

29:29.472 --> 29:38.741
where if they had needed information on a specific 
topic, they could come check the index file, and

29:29.472 --> 29:38.741
this would guide them to the source material. 
That's right.

29:42.301 --> 29:46.606
Does that system still exist over in the School of 
Medicine? I do not know. You didn't take it with you

29:48.407 --> 29:49.849
when you left? Yes, I took it with me because I have 
been on several consulting cases. I see. And that

29:56.596 --> 29:59.960
was my source of information. And one was a court 
case, and the other one was, I don't know whether

29:59.980 --> 30:09.810
it's still pending or not, But

30:11.630 --> 30:20.982
I needed those cards for that purpose or they'll 
eventually end up out there.
