WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:06.667
nice pants or blue jeans or things like that and 
look nice, well, I think they're fine. But I don't

00:07.488 --> 00:13.636
like these slouchy ones that just anything's all 
right because nowadays people wear pants. I went

00:14.818 --> 00:22.728
to the doctor's office in Houston with my sister 
the other day, and honey, you just wouldn't

00:14.818 --> 00:22.728
realize the people came in there dressed like they 
did. There was about four of us in that office, and

00:23.429 --> 00:28.536
it was full that were dressed decent. And the rest 
of them wear the slouchiest things. They just wear

00:31.279 --> 00:33.101
any kind of old sandals. Some of them wear their 
house shoes. House shoes, my God. That's going a

00:36.746 --> 00:37.807
little too far. That's true. And they just don't 
dress like they should for young girls, I don't

00:39.209 --> 00:43.974
think. Now, as far as pants, I'm all for them. I 
think they're nice when they're nice and clean and

00:47.078 --> 00:50.903
all. And I do like them. But I do not like them. 
People just take for granted, well, everybody

00:56.022 --> 00:59.106
wears pants. Well, I can just stick on anything. 
Tie your shirt tail around your stomach and go on.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.513
They think that's all right, but I don't. I just 
don't think we ought to do that, not out in public.

01:15.585 --> 01:21.152
Mrs. Presnell,

01:15.585 --> 01:21.152
what kind of entertainment did y'all have when 
y'all were younger? Well, in those days, you see,

01:22.077 --> 01:28.868
we had no cars or anything like that, so we went on 
foot or horseback or something like that. So we

01:29.268 --> 01:34.657
just had our entertainment around in the 
neighborhood, and we had what they called play

01:29.268 --> 01:34.657
parties. It's kind of like square dancing. And we 
made the music ourselves. We sang instead of

01:39.003 --> 01:40.446
having them. Y'all didn't have any instruments to 
play? No, we sang as we played. So then... We would

01:46.580 --> 01:52.873
meet at the homes and have singings, religious 
songs. Whoever had organ or piano in the home,

01:53.054 --> 01:56.421
that's where we'd meet. And we always did that lots 
of times, maybe once a week. And then we had ice

02:00.008 --> 02:02.293
cream suppers. My daddy was always big on giving 
ice cream supper for all the people in the

02:03.320 --> 02:07.908
community. And everybody would come and bring 
homemade ice cream. I love homemade ice cream.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.446
Everybody would make cakes, and everybody 
pitched in and brought stuff. But we really had a

02:17.566 --> 02:21.413
good time when we had those big ice cream suppers. 
And we always, and when we have those parties, you

02:22.643 --> 02:31.079
know those days in the community you had no place 
for recreation or anything. That's right. But

02:31.861 --> 02:39.756
we'd just take a bedroom, we'd take everything out 
of that bedroom and store it somewhere else and

02:31.861 --> 02:39.756
just clean that room out and that's where we had our 
party in that room. And then when it was over with,

02:39.736 --> 02:43.720
of course, it all had to be put back. But still, it 
was lots of fun, and it was good, clean fun. And I'll

02:47.925 --> 02:50.408
never forget one night. Go ahead. I went to a party, 
and I really liked this boy. It was the first boy I

02:56.794 --> 02:59.337
ever had. And somebody had their violin there, and 
they got to playing the violin. And he came over and

03:05.656 --> 03:09.401
asked me, he said, won't you come on and dance with 
me? I said, I can't. He said, oh, you can. I said, no,

03:12.164 --> 03:13.326
I can't. I said, I wouldn't get home before Papa 
would know it. And he didn't let us dance now. Papa

03:18.051 --> 03:18.572
didn't. He didn't believe in it. We could go to 
these play parties and make our own music, but we

03:19.533 --> 03:23.578
didn't dance by other music. So I just couldn't 
turn him down. So I got up and danced with him. But

03:29.365 --> 03:31.008
Papa knew it before I got home. And I didn't go 
anywhere for a month. We were penalized when we did

03:33.871 --> 03:38.818
things that we knew that we shouldn't do. And, of 
course, I didn't see any harm in it. And I said,

03:40.955 --> 03:43.658
well, it was worth it to get to dance with him. 
Because you liked him, right? Yeah, I really did.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.183
Well, did y'all ride? I mean, was a lot of y'all do 
horseback riding? Yeah, we did lots of horseback

03:50.345 --> 03:52.127
riding. Did y'all play games on horses? Like, my 
mother used to do that. No, I don't think we did. And

03:56.792 --> 03:58.474
we used to play basketball. We'd meet on Sunday and 
play basketball. We'd play baseball, things like

04:00.196 --> 04:02.719
that. Boys and girls all played together and just 
had a big time. And we just... I'll never forget one

04:08.127 --> 04:12.493
time, another girl and I were going somewhere 
horseback. And I was riding a horse that belonged

04:13.434 --> 04:15.638
to my brother. And she wouldn't let nobody outrun 
her. Now, no horse was going to outrun her. And we

04:21.265 --> 04:24.129
was just trotting along, and she thought we was 
fixing her. This other horse was going to outrun

04:24.810 --> 04:26.172
her. And she took off down through that winding 
road through the woods. And I'm going to tell you, I

04:29.918 --> 04:31.880
just did stay on. I'd like to never stopped her. She 
was crazy as she could be. And finally. Her coat was

04:38.249 --> 04:41.674
the cause of this boy that I liked so well's death. 
She ran into a tree with him and killed him. The

04:44.037 --> 04:44.458
horse? The horse's coat was. We had sold her to him. 
My brother had sold him to him, and this horse ran

04:48.824 --> 04:52.569
into a tree. He was racing him. And how do you say how 
he could run into a tree? He just didn't look? I

04:57.535 --> 04:58.397
don't know how come. I don't know anything about 
it. The horse must have been blind. That's what

05:01.561 --> 05:03.223
happened. It just killed him. He died just a day or 
so. It's too bad. Mm-hmm. So that was the kind of

05:08.405 --> 05:10.848
entertainment we had. It was good coon fun. We 
enjoyed it. Because that's all we knew. We didn't

05:14.754 --> 05:16.977
have picture shows to go to. Well, we didn't have 
transportation to go to picture shows. No

05:18.999 --> 05:19.880
television either. No, we didn't have no 
television. No radio? No. The only way was we'd

05:22.544 --> 05:28.472
have these Edison record players, you know, that 
you wind up. We had one of those. Had lots of records

05:29.959 --> 05:31.321
for that. We enjoyed that a lot. And I'd give 
anything now if I had that. I bet you would. Anybody

05:36.086 --> 05:36.687
would. It's antique right now. It used to cylinder 
type records, you know. It had a big horn on it.

05:44.755 --> 05:45.176
Yeah. We have one at the house. I just wonder 
sometimes why they went with it. The one we went

05:49.841 --> 05:51.363
with, my mother's got one at the house. But it's not 
the wind-up. It has a horn. It was real pretty.
