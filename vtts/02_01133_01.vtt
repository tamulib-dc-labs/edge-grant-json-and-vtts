WEBVTT

00:01.448 --> 00:05.993
B for Boy, R as in Robert, OT, MAN, Rotman. And I'm a 
former newspaper man who went into the public

00:06.834 --> 00:17.928
relations field and ultimately built a large 
public relations counseling firm headquartered

00:06.834 --> 00:17.928
in Chicago. And we ended up with five offices in 
five cities and abroad in London. I was CEO and

00:26.658 --> 00:30.983
chairman of that company. up until about five 
years ago when I merged it with a New York firm. Our

00:36.800 --> 00:43.629
firm was called Hershey, Rotman & Druck, and then I 
merged it with another firm, and I became

00:36.800 --> 00:43.629
president of that firm. Then I decided to retire 
three years ago. I now have a company called Morris

00:50.559 --> 00:58.911
B. Rotman Associates, although I still serve as a 
consultant to that combined firm. For all intents

00:59.228 --> 01:03.111
and purposes, I'm no longer involved with my 
previous firm. I'm retired from there. And I do my

01:05.073 --> 01:06.394
own thing. And included in my own thing is 
relationships with about six companies that know

01:06.775 --> 01:17.164
me very well, know me for a long time, where I give 
them some of my time. And most of the time, however,

01:17.865 --> 01:21.548
I do my own thing, whatever that may be. Where was 
your residence for the most part? My residence is

01:24.330 --> 01:25.671
still in Chicago. In Chicago, OK. where my wife and 
I spent six months, and where the headquarters of

01:27.815 --> 01:32.200
our company was. I also have a residence in Palm 
Springs, California, where I spend six months of

01:33.422 --> 01:49.821
the year, from approximately November to May, and 
from which, it's really not Palm Springs, it's

01:33.422 --> 01:49.821
Rancho Mirage, but I refer to Palm Springs as 
that's the one most people understand. They say

01:49.881 --> 01:53.986
Rancho Mirage, they wonder which state it's in. 
Best known for Gerald Ford, And Frank Sinatra and

01:55.895 --> 01:58.757
people like that, not me. But I commute from Palm 
Springs to my various client relationships.

02:05.183 --> 02:06.624
During those months, I'm there. And I move all my 
equipment, my files, and all that stuff. So in

02:11.048 --> 02:14.351
effect, I set up an office for six months. And now 
we're going to make the return to Chicago in May.

02:19.796 --> 02:21.577
This is pretty much a regular routine? Yeah. How 
much time do you spend here in this area? Houston

02:25.156 --> 02:27.839
area? Well, I come down every couple months for 
three days. Most of the time it's on a three-month

02:32.585 --> 02:36.649
interval, about four times a year. But I also come 
down for very special events, mostly involved

02:36.729 --> 02:45.800
with my personal relationship with the Mitchell 
family. Sometimes I come down for celebrations,

02:45.880 --> 02:50.265
family things, opening of the pavilion. So I would 
say I get to Houston or Galveston. maybe six times a

02:54.113 --> 02:55.896
year. And as a result of our professional 
relationship, George and I have become close

02:57.558 --> 03:07.052
friends, and our families are close to one 
another. So that we consider both of us, both our

03:07.994 --> 03:14.644
families, extended families in a way. And we've 
gotten to know all the kids. They know our kids. And

03:19.431 --> 03:22.956
it's been a wonderful relationship of a true 
friend. Where did you do your journalism work? I

03:27.794 --> 03:31.800
assume your background is in journalism? Well, 
the kind of background I have, I wouldn't

03:31.820 --> 03:37.648
recommend to my son, nor to anybody else's son. If 
you wanted to break into journalism or public

03:37.668 --> 03:45.019
relations, don't do it the way I did it, because it 
would be almost impossible today. I've only had a

03:45.780 --> 03:50.527
year and a half of college work. I was in junior 
college in Chicago. And there was economic

03:54.982 --> 04:01.147
uncertainty in my family, and I was the only one to 
help resolve that. So I went to work, even though I

04:01.328 --> 04:05.852
had other brothers. I had an opportunity when I was 
in college. I was editor of the paper, and a weekly

04:08.834 --> 04:13.719
newspaper chain gave me a chance to work for two 
weeks. And they were impressed with what I did, and

04:13.799 --> 04:18.243
the publisher finally said, hey, you can finish 
your college work at night. We're going to start a

04:18.523 --> 04:21.626
new newspaper, and we'll make you the editor. 
That's great. I was all of them. I think I must have

04:24.816 --> 04:27.218
been eighteen or nineteen at that time. That's 
great. That's exciting. And I became editor of a

04:28.799 --> 04:34.945
paper called the Lakeview Booster in Chicago, a 
neighborhood newspaper. And I've never stopped

04:35.705 --> 04:37.607
working since. I went from there to being- are you 
interested in my- Yes, sir. Yeah, we really are. I

04:44.473 --> 04:52.900
worked for the newspaper for about a year, and then 
they started a newspaper out in a place called

04:44.473 --> 04:52.900
Cistro, Illinois. home base of the gangsters at 
one time, Al Capone's headquarters. And the same

04:57.859 --> 05:05.887
group of people who owned the paper I worked for 
started a newspaper in Cicero, Berwyn, and Oak

04:57.859 --> 05:05.887
Park, the three suburbs there. And they really 
needed an editor and a circulation manager, jack

05:06.567 --> 05:11.151
of all trades. And I went out there to do that kind of 
work. And I worked there for about a year. It was a

05:17.457 --> 05:21.621
very unusual experience because I wore at least 
ten hats. Yeah, you got to pick up the business side

05:21.736 --> 05:26.221
of it very quickly, too, I'm sure. Well, I sold ads. 
I was circulation manager. I was editor. I was

05:32.388 --> 05:33.109
reporter. I was proofreader. I ran a travel bureau 
when I had a free day on Wednesday. I'd be waiting on

05:39.536 --> 05:40.617
the bus. You know, you make money wherever you can, 
so I used to sell tickets. And then Wednesday

05:44.181 --> 05:46.644
nights I ran a tour of Chinatown. Is that right? For 
the club ladies. All for, I think, I was making $28 a

05:49.630 --> 05:51.793
week. And then from then, they started a newspaper 
on the west side of Chicago. And I went there as

05:55.939 --> 05:59.544
editor and publisher, in a way. I did everything 
again. And then I went to the City News Bureau of

06:01.287 --> 06:07.616
Chicago, which is a famed training ground for 
journalists. And I became, I think, the first man

06:07.636 --> 06:16.289
or woman, first employee they ever hired who 
wasn't on the dean's list of a journalism school.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.333
But the managing editor there took a chance on me 
based on my background and I rose very rapidly

06:19.735 --> 06:25.423
there from reporter to rewrite man to editor. And 
from there I went to the Community Fund of Chicago,

06:26.444 --> 06:32.112
which is a fundraising red feather agency. 
They're raising funds for all the health and

06:32.853 --> 06:35.617
welfare agencies in Chicago. I became public 
relations director there for two years and I met a

06:35.637 --> 06:47.413
lot of important executives in the business 
community, met most of the top newspaper men

06:35.637 --> 06:47.413
because I was representing You know, a cohesive 
community interest there. And a man who had a

06:50.721 --> 06:58.087
little public relations for him by the name of Bill 
Hershey was impressed with my work. We had

06:58.688 --> 07:00.149
something to do with one another. He came in, asked 
my help, and my boss gave me. And he went to my boss

07:03.752 --> 07:06.074
and said, I'd like to hire that young man. And I was 
very upset. I didn't want to leave, because I had a

07:07.976 --> 07:10.338
pretty good job there. But he kept after me. And I 
finally said, listen, I'll come in as you make me a

07:13.981 --> 07:17.164
partner. So I came in as a partner of his firm in 
1949, and we worked together. Well, it was 1946,

07:24.697 --> 07:28.362
and we worked together for a couple of years, and 
then he died. He had a stroke, and luckily we were by

07:28.943 --> 07:34.251
then a corporation, and I had the right to buy his 
stock. The firm was $74,000 a year in gross. That's

07:40.139 --> 07:42.342
the kind of fees we had. Making no money at all. And I 
built it. into a six million dollar firm. You know,

07:50.935 --> 07:56.301
just maybe desperation, whatever it was, maybe I 
was there at the right time. Until we, we were the

07:56.321 --> 08:00.185
largest public relations firm in Chicago. What 
kind of accounts did you, were you developing in

08:00.886 --> 08:03.990
those days? Well in the early days, I guess the 
first tent strike I had was I got a small division of

08:04.010 --> 08:11.738
General Motors called the Hertz Rent-A-Car. 
Hertz was an obscure little company. Most people

08:15.430 --> 08:17.352
don't know it was owned by General Motors. And GM 
tried to hide it under a bushel basket, so to speak,

08:17.572 --> 08:25.239
because they felt there was a conflict between 
renting and selling cars. And they were concerned

08:25.939 --> 08:27.841
too many people knew about it. And so Hertz 
merchandised on its own without too much support

08:29.162 --> 08:34.066
from General Motors. And ultimately, General 
Motors sold it off. They wanted to get rid of an

08:36.368 --> 08:37.930
embarrassment. I think it was a mistake in a way, 
maybe. When I was working for Hertz, it was a $20

08:42.025 --> 08:45.971
million company, something like that. And now it 
must be close to a billion, a large company. But

08:50.357 --> 08:56.926
that was a very important breakthrough for me, 
because I sold a national account. And I would say

08:56.946 --> 09:11.307
that it had another element that I liked, in that 
Hertz was so small that there was a merchandising

08:56.946 --> 09:11.307
committee, a marketing committee, so to speak, 
made up of the principal licensees around the

08:56.946 --> 09:11.307
country. And they ran the company. And I was on that 
committee. See, Hertz was a kind of an association

09:16.394 --> 09:21.901
in a way. The central organization, Hertz 
Incorporated, owned what they call stations of

09:22.522 --> 09:26.989
their own. And there were a handful of them, 
leading cities. But the best cities were in Miami

09:30.454 --> 09:36.042
and Denver and I think Los Angeles. And those 
weren't owned by Hertz. And when Hertz ultimately

09:39.587 --> 09:41.209
went public, They would then start one by one to buy 
out most of the independent licensees. In those

09:46.895 --> 09:52.000
days, it was these buccaneers, these 
entrepreneurs that were running the company. And

09:52.020 --> 09:53.382
I sat in with them. And they respected my opinion, 
even though I was quite a young man. And that really

09:57.246 --> 10:02.132
helped me develop as an individual, as a 
professional. And I really enjoyed that. Then,

10:05.175 --> 10:07.638
little by little, I began to sell accounts. We had 
an office in Rochester, New York. When my partner

10:11.598 --> 10:14.101
was alive, we had a couple of accounts there. And I 
built that office, though, where we had about 14

10:14.742 --> 10:18.567
people working for us there. We had all the leading 
business in Rochester. We had the Bausch & Lomb,

10:21.351 --> 10:26.598
Graflex Company, the makers of the camera. That's 
headquarters of Kodak as well. Pardon? That used

10:29.301 --> 10:30.883
to be the headquarters of Kodak as well. It is still 
the headquarters of Kodak, sure. But we had a

10:33.106 --> 10:34.108
handful. Taylor Instruments had some wonderful 
accounts there. And then we... We had an

10:39.982 --> 10:58.425
affiliation in New York, but when I sold an account 
in New York City and opened my own office

10:39.982 --> 10:58.425
ultimately, from a half-time employee working 
for us, you know, to the point where I guess when I

10:39.982 --> 10:58.425
hung up my shingle, we had about 150 employees 
there, you know. An aside, I was thinking about the

10:59.647 --> 11:06.776
other day when I was talking to the staff here, 
Taylor Instruments. I was called over. by the PR

11:08.956 --> 11:09.937
director. He wanted to get us in there. Been trying 
for a year. He knew I was in town. He said, listen,

11:13.841 --> 11:16.985
he's having a meeting today, and they agreed to see 
you. I said, I'm not even prepared. I don't have

11:18.046 --> 11:18.887
anything. I don't have an easel or anything like 
that. He said, come over, do the best you can. So I

11:23.812 --> 11:24.233
came. All I had was a handful of flippings, you 
know, illustrating what we did for Bausch and

11:24.313 --> 11:28.197
Lund. And I got into this room, and it was kind of 
fall, and the red ear was on. And it was so hot. And of

11:36.821 --> 11:38.002
course, I was nervous. I was perspiring for juice. 
And I started to say to the chairman of the company,

11:41.426 --> 11:45.551
he said, what kind of organization are you? I said, 
well, we're kind of a shirt sleeves organization,

11:45.571 --> 11:48.294
you know. Get down the brass tacks and all that 
stuff. Principled and honest and all that. And I

11:53.740 --> 11:54.541
was perspiring. And I said, do you mind if I take off 
my coat? So I took off my jacket and I hung it up on

11:57.063 --> 11:59.346
something. Everybody else was suited up. And they 
told me the turning point was I dramatically

12:03.310 --> 12:06.574
illustrated how sure you were. And I did it 
unconsciously. I didn't do it for that reason. And

12:09.557 --> 12:20.911
the other account, of course, Bausch & Lomb was a 
tremendous coup because we were selected from

12:09.557 --> 12:20.911
competition. All other major agencies wanted 
that account. I think the reason we got it was we had

12:24.675 --> 12:27.839
another account in Rochester. We had a little 
office there, finally. Bausch & Lomb became very

12:31.019 --> 12:44.637
important to me in my whole professional career 
because at one time they developed the

12:31.019 --> 12:44.637
cinemascope lens with Spiros Skouras and 20th 
Century Fox. And they did the first film,

12:44.657 --> 12:49.083
cinemascope film, The Rope, if you remember that. 
Yeah, sure. And President Bausch & Lomb called me

12:50.144 --> 12:59.997
in one day and said, you know, we deserve a special 
award from the Academy for our development in that

12:50.144 --> 12:59.997
scientific field. optics system, and he said, all 
of our people have tried to talk to the academy. In

13:05.778 --> 13:12.646
fact, the head of the academy's technical 
advisory committee has tried to get it for us, and

13:05.778 --> 13:12.646
maybe you can do something. Do you know anybody out 
there? I said, no, but I'll sure as hell try. So I

13:17.351 --> 13:22.397
contacted a number of people, and I found out who 
the head of the academy was. It was a woman named

13:22.417 --> 13:24.939
Margaret Herrick. Do you want to know all this? 
Yeah, go ahead. This is fun. This is fascinating.

13:28.704 --> 13:30.085
And Margaret Herrick... I got an appointment with 
her through a contact, and she said, when she

13:30.638 --> 13:36.827
talked to me, she said, I'm only going to give you a 
half hour. So she knew what I wanted. So I sat down

13:39.772 --> 13:43.057
and I said, how do you go about getting an award? I 
think they deserve it. She said, you don't ask for

13:44.078 --> 13:45.080
it. They've made the mistake of asking for an award 
through the years. So I did something that was

13:49.366 --> 13:54.995
unconsciously brilliant. I said to her, do you 
mind if I destroy the file? That wasn't, again, it

13:58.060 --> 14:02.187
isn't a device that I invented. It was just an idea. 
Why not start fresh? It's a conscious reaction.

14:06.453 --> 14:08.617
She had a kind of a wry look to her face. She was kind 
of bemused. She reached in her phone. She gave it to

14:10.980 --> 14:11.641
me. I tore it up and I threw it in her wastebasket. I 
said, okay, let's start fresh. The half hour

14:18.793 --> 14:21.978
extended to about three and a half hours. She's a 
very busy lady. She told me how people have gotten

14:25.482 --> 14:29.529
awards for contributions to the motion picture 
industry. Honest contributions. And I said to

14:32.574 --> 14:40.266
her, is there anything that's needed in the motion 
picture industry I might be able to influence my

14:32.574 --> 14:40.266
client to do on a long-range basis? And they were 
looking for a means of copying all those films that

14:41.047 --> 14:51.945
were copied on paper and were turning into dust in 
the Library of Congress. You look at history and

14:52.297 --> 14:54.980
motion picture, a lot of that stuff's on paper. And 
it's disappearing. You know, a national

14:56.662 --> 14:57.943
treasure. And Bausch & Lomb had copying equipment 
of all kinds. And I convinced Bausch & Lomb to

15:02.208 --> 15:06.472
contribute all that copying equipment. And then 
the whole process started, which still goes on to

15:06.632 --> 15:09.135
this day. Now, they didn't get an award for that. 
No. But the climate was right, so that the Academy

15:11.958 --> 15:14.501
felt... Appreciated what they were doing. Knew 
them. All of a sudden, they looked at Bausch & Lomb

15:16.143 --> 15:19.126
in a different light. And about a year later, The 
head of the academy called me and says, can you get

15:21.423 --> 15:29.111
your client to Hollywood on such and such a date? I 
know it was the day of the Oscar. I said, what's the

15:30.452 --> 15:31.793
purpose? Just get them there. Now, what happened 
there, the reason it was a turning point in my life,

15:33.835 --> 15:49.911
was that lady, a very smart lady, was looking at me, 
as well as my client, and she was saying to herself,

15:33.835 --> 15:49.911
this guy may be the guy who can handle our public 
relations, which is on a thought that never

15:51.241 --> 15:54.445
occurred to me. You know, it was a dream. Small 
agency in Chicago to get the famous Academy of

15:55.866 --> 16:00.431
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Yeah, so she 
said to me in her first, what would you think about

16:00.471 --> 16:06.698
handling an account like this? I said, well, I 
think it would be fantastic. I said, but I don't

16:10.122 --> 16:14.146
know, number one, I don't know too much about the 
agency. Number two, I guess I'd have to open an

16:14.227 --> 16:18.371
office here, and I don't know if I could afford to. 
And number three, I understand you have an

16:19.810 --> 16:25.798
incumbent, and I never take business away from 
anybody unless they've been informed that

16:19.810 --> 16:25.798
they're going out. I said, have you informed the 
incumbent? She said, no. I said, when you do, if you

16:29.522 --> 16:32.466
want me to, I'll come back. Well, that impressed 
her. It's, again, one of these unconscious things

16:34.369 --> 16:36.371
you do. Now, maybe it's part of your basic morality 
that you do the right thing under certain

16:36.712 --> 16:42.339
circumstances. And my morality has never been to 
take an account away from anybody, an incumbent.

16:47.426 --> 16:47.826
I've done it. client asked me to come in, I always 
see that the circumstances are such that they're

16:48.532 --> 16:57.763
totally dissatisfied and have informed the other 
agency that they're going to interview us.

16:58.124 --> 16:59.886
Because I don't want people to do that to me either. 
No, you're right. So about three months later, six

17:01.668 --> 17:06.734
months later, whatever the case may be, she called 
me. Would you come back and talk? Have you

17:08.416 --> 17:09.117
informed? Yes. Okay, I came back and I made a 
presentation. And she told her directors that we

17:13.362 --> 17:17.087
were going to get the accounts. Well, all hell 
broke out in Hollywood, because there must be 50

17:17.759 --> 17:25.007
firms that wanted it, and they were all insiders, 
and I was an outsider. My advantage was that there

17:25.908 --> 17:29.512
would be no conflicts. And if I had the Academy 
account, I wouldn't handle motion. PictureStars

17:32.015 --> 17:34.558
or studios didn't want them. And I told them, when I 
made my presentation, I wouldn't take any

17:34.578 --> 17:38.102
conflicts. Again, it was an unconscious, or maybe 
it was deliberate, move on my part that was right.

17:44.523 --> 17:46.245
And there was such a hullabaloo. I saw telegrams 
from Samuel Goldwyn, all kinds of people. How can

17:49.610 --> 17:50.992
you select an outsider? Here's a firm you want to 
select. But they called us back, and they

17:52.954 --> 17:55.418
interviewed 20 agencies. And when I went in there, 
I decided I wasn't going to make a presentation. I

18:01.666 --> 18:02.948
was going to talk about integrity. And I closed my 
presentation, which I did. And I talked about our

18:07.334 --> 18:10.999
agencies and my principles and what I believed in 
and all that. And we got the accounts. And it's

18:12.620 --> 18:14.142
lasted to this day. Is that right? My agency still 
has it, sure. Is that right? And about three years

18:16.964 --> 18:24.192
ago, I was elected an associate member of the 
Academy, which is a rare honor for a layman. I'm not

18:24.212 --> 18:26.594
in the motion picture business. And I still go to 
the Academy Awards. I've gone to 35. That's

18:29.137 --> 18:30.559
exciting. That's quite a career. So I'm most 
prominently identified, because that's such a

18:33.041 --> 18:40.669
celebrity account, I'm most prominently 
identified with the Academy. in public relations

18:40.987 --> 18:42.168
circles. You ask people about me, they say, oh 
yeah, he worked with the Academy so many years. But

18:46.994 --> 18:53.140
actually our agency was a corporate public 
relations firm with only one show business

18:46.994 --> 18:53.140
account. Yeah, that was the Academy. We did handle 
the Tournament of Roses for a number of years. That

18:58.787 --> 18:59.868
was the only other one. But that's kind of show 
business. But all our other accounts, as it

19:03.612 --> 19:08.918
developed, were major corporations. And we grew 
from our Chicago office. We already had a

19:12.945 --> 19:15.808
Rochester office, but we opened in New York. And 
then when I got the Academy, I opened in Los Angeles

19:16.588 --> 19:23.775
with, again, a one-man office. And then I got the 
Mattel account out there. Barbie doll and all

19:26.938 --> 19:28.019
that. That became a very large account. Then we got 
the Avocado Board out there. Who was the Avocado

19:34.364 --> 19:35.906
Board then? Avocados. Oh, yeah, sure, food 
production. Yeah, yeah. And marketing advisory

19:42.485 --> 19:43.927
boards. And they have budgets and they hire PR 
firms. So we did a program to get more people to use

19:47.351 --> 19:53.980
avocados in a variety of ways. And we had the Kiwi 
account and the California pistachios and, you

19:54.881 --> 20:07.238
know, all those things need public relations 
activity. It occurred to me that our firm had

20:07.741 --> 20:36.718
service capabilities in Europe, and I bought into 
a British firm, and they added our name to theirs,

20:07.741 --> 20:36.718
and then we developed a network of firms 
throughout the world, so that we had an associated

20:07.741 --> 20:36.718
firm, where we referred business to one another, 
and in some cases they used our name on the door, and

20:07.741 --> 20:36.718
it was closer than just a loose affiliation, and we 
had a a relationship in Tokyo, and in Milan, and

20:37.306 --> 20:46.059
Rome, and Paris, and Scandinavian countries, and 
South America. You know, where our clients might

20:46.520 --> 20:49.344
need services. You did a history of your firm done. 
That sounds like a good project. Well, yeah. I

20:55.172 --> 21:00.320
started to write, make some notes on, not so much 
history of the firm. You know, that's, I don't know

21:01.041 --> 21:02.944
how interesting that is. What's interesting I 
would say is some of the campaigns that I've been

21:04.728 --> 21:15.477
in, and some of the extraordinary people that I've 
worked with, like George, a fellow who invented

21:04.728 --> 21:15.477
the idea of the rent-a-car business. Or I worked 
for Harold Janine at ITT. Those are some of the

21:20.662 --> 21:23.304
great men of American industry. And I worked with 
some prominent politicians, like Stevenson.

21:27.208 --> 21:33.553
Yeah, those are...

21:34.242 --> 21:38.207
Now, how did I get involved with George? Is that 
what you want to know? Yes, sir. I became a member in

21:42.072 --> 21:47.299
1950, I became a member of a group called Young 
Presidents Organization. Are you familiar with

21:47.319 --> 21:48.641
YPO? We know, we've heard of it. If you would 
elaborate a bit, that would be very useful. Well,

21:53.847 --> 22:02.038
there was a fellow by the name of Ray Hickok, Hickok 
Belt, who became president father's company,

22:02.356 --> 22:08.601
tender age, maybe he was in his 20s, and he realized 
he needed to talk to peers. You know, you could talk

22:09.342 --> 22:13.445
to an attorney, talk to an accountant, but nobody 
was a contemporary. So they start talking to a

22:13.485 --> 22:17.409
couple of fellows he knew who had the same 
predicament he had. And before you knew it, there

22:18.049 --> 22:22.213
were five guys who were meeting together on a 
regular basis. Well, today there are probably

22:22.913 --> 22:27.397
6,000 members of the Young Presidents 
Organization. And the criteria for admission to

22:28.438 --> 22:31.941
YPO was that you In those days, you had to have 50 
employees, a million dollars in gross value, not

22:32.073 --> 22:38.663
net worth, but gross value. And you had to be under 
40 years of age when you became president of your

22:39.725 --> 22:44.733
company. And you retired. You retired into Never 
Never Land when you were 49. You became what we call

22:51.784 --> 22:55.149
49ers. And after that, there are two senior 
organizations now. the World Business Council,

22:59.208 --> 23:05.979
and the Chief Executives Organization, which 
George Mitchell and I belong to also. And CEO, the

23:06.720 --> 23:20.262
latter one, Chief Executives Organization, you 
have to be voted into on a basis of your popularity,

23:06.720 --> 23:20.262
prominence, or your activities. If you were 
active and CEO, a lot of people knew you and voted

23:20.723 --> 23:26.312
for you to come in. George had a very prominent 
position. He was chairman a couple years back. And

23:31.294 --> 23:35.318
I've been on the board and all that kind of stuff. 
And more than that, I've run conventions. And

23:38.882 --> 23:44.107
frankly, whenever George got a difficult job to do 
and he didn't have time for it, he gave it to me.

23:45.789 --> 23:53.557
Because he was the director and I was not, he was 
named to do a convention in Phoenix. That must have

23:54.618 --> 23:56.620
been about 10 years ago now. And he made me his vice 
chairman or something like that. And I pulled the

24:02.094 --> 24:03.856
whole thing together. And it was quite an 
extraordinary event. We had a thing called

24:06.761 --> 24:11.828
Encounters, Strange Encounters with the Fourth 
Estate. And we had Dan Rather and Rook Kaiser and

24:13.410 --> 24:26.168
Ted Koppel and Paul Conrad, the cartoonist. The 
fellow who used to do sports. He had a loud voice.

24:32.156 --> 24:32.877
What was his name? He's retired now.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.105
Boxing and all that stuff. I forget his name. I know 
the voice. You know the voice, yeah. But we had an

24:41.430 --> 24:49.182
all-star aggregation of people talking about the 
relationship between business and the Fourth

24:41.430 --> 24:49.182
Estate. It was fascinating. George was the 
chairman of it, really. But I did it. He did it. I got

24:55.793 --> 24:56.073
it. He's pretty good at delegating things. Yeah. 
And George and I have been involved in things like

25:00.038 --> 25:02.421
that. Wherever he gets involved in something, or I 
get involved in something, and I bring him into the

25:02.962 --> 25:08.569
thing, because of our friendship. So we were on a 
mission once, on a journey. YPO has had

25:12.433 --> 25:17.660
conventions, one domestic and one local. And it's 
called the University for Presidents. where you

25:20.182 --> 25:31.078
go to a site, either internationally or locally, 
you get a syllabus and a curriculum book, and you

25:20.182 --> 25:31.078
look through it and you select courses. You and 
your wife can take the courses. And it's gotten to a

25:33.722 --> 25:43.797
point now where it's an all-star faculty, because 
the best people from the universities and the best

25:33.722 --> 25:43.797
people in politics and literature want to speak to 
us. You're such an influential group. And we have a

25:46.240 --> 25:49.345
turn-down request from people. But we've had 
Presidents of the United States, the top

25:49.983 --> 25:55.410
senators, the top scientists, you name them. And 
I've become good friends with a number of people

25:55.430 --> 25:58.734
who've come that way. And George and I were going to 
Greece.

26:05.683 --> 26:09.488
He was actually going to the conference in Athens, 
and I was. And George, as you may or may not know,

26:09.569 --> 26:15.176
seldom travels with his wife because they're 
brood. They have 10 children. It's a risky

26:17.339 --> 26:19.922
business when you've got that kind of a big family. 
My wife and I always traveled together, although

26:20.577 --> 26:25.064
we only have three children. That's a small family 
compared to the Mitchell family. But George and I

26:29.491 --> 26:31.554
sat next to each other. And he's a friendly guy, and 
we kept talking. And he asked me what I do, and I

26:36.222 --> 26:41.230
asked what he does, and he said he's in the energy 
business. He's such an unassuming guy, in a way,

26:41.250 --> 26:48.441
and an old shoe type of personality. He said he was 
in the energy business. I figured he had a couple of

26:50.387 --> 26:51.869
gas stations. I didn't know where he had. And he 
said, someday we're going to go public with my

26:52.930 --> 26:57.055
company. Again, I realized it was a small company. 
And he said, you know, we probably need public

27:00.019 --> 27:02.222
relations. I'll give you a call. And I guess we 
didn't talk for about six months or a year. And he

27:06.948 --> 27:07.849
called me one day. And he said, can you come down and 
talk to our people? And I talked to his people. And

27:13.837 --> 27:15.399
they interviewed. They interviewed maybe six 
firms at that time. Because they weren't going to

27:17.969 --> 27:21.955
accept somebody that George just met on a plane. 
And we got the accounts. And, of course, I would

27:23.978 --> 27:29.686
come down here on a very frequent basis as I 
realized some of the things George was doing. What

27:30.767 --> 27:31.588
was his charge? What was his interest in public 
relations at that point when you made that first

27:31.608 --> 27:37.797
contact? Was it energy, selling energy? Well, 
when you go public, you have a disclosure

27:41.242 --> 27:46.069
obligation. So that was the motive, really, that 
he used? Well, probably in the back of his mind, he

27:49.625 --> 27:56.395
said to himself, I'm going public, and I want to be 
sure there's an appreciation of my stock. But you

27:57.236 --> 27:59.519
think first of disclosure obligations. You know, 
it's really a pain in the neck to go public. You've

28:02.484 --> 28:03.465
got responsibility. You've got to turn on any 
report, quarterly reports. You've got to

28:06.249 --> 28:09.113
interface with the security analysts. You've got 
to be prone to certain kind of publicity, which

28:10.195 --> 28:13.960
George wasn't previously. He was a very private 
person. And you need some expert guidance in that

28:16.205 --> 28:19.409
mine field. So that's number one. I don't think 
George ever said to me, I wanted my stock to go up.

28:24.815 --> 28:25.736
No, of course not. No, I think most people don't do 
that. But there's no question if you add good

28:27.298 --> 28:33.545
communications to a good profit picture, your 
stock's going to go up. The public will appreciate

28:33.605 --> 28:35.988
it. How did you evaluate or analyze, what was your 
impression of Mitchell Energy at that time, and of

28:36.809 --> 28:46.060
George Mitchell as a public corporation, let's 
say? Well, I saw that he had great leadership

28:47.221 --> 28:50.144
potential. I saw something that intrigued me that 
he was so brilliant and far-reaching and so

28:51.906 --> 28:58.855
visionary. I hadn't run into anybody like that in a 
long time. Out of my whole clientele, I probably

29:01.398 --> 29:06.443
dealt with maybe 500 chief executives through the 
years. He was way ahead of them because there's

29:07.024 --> 29:14.713
only a couple of people I can think of in the United 
States that function in the same league as George

29:15.098 --> 29:17.941
Mitchell. Another dear friend of mine, Bob 
Galvin, who owns Motorola Company. He's now

29:24.569 --> 29:28.194
become chairman of the executive committee. He 
was chairman and chief executive for many years.

29:30.636 --> 29:34.701
Motorola went from $200 million to about $6 
billion today. It takes that kind of vision and

29:34.721 --> 29:43.772
drive and ability to pull people around you, 
ability to take chances with people, a whole

29:34.721 --> 29:43.772
variety of things. I could see that George's mind 
worked so rapidly. The reason George talks fast is

29:47.068 --> 29:50.951
because he's trying to keep up with his mind. It's 
moving very, very rapidly. Yeah, we interviewed

29:54.755 --> 29:56.537
him. It was very difficult to transcribe that 
interview. I know, I know. He moves so fast. In a

30:03.444 --> 30:08.389
way, I guess he saw a kinship in me that I shared his 
dream. Whatever it is, I got on the

30:09.630 --> 30:14.215
merry-go-round. and went with him.

30:19.086 --> 30:26.836
What I lent to that was, along the line, there were 
opportunities for dramatic execution of his

30:19.086 --> 30:26.836
ideas.

30:29.760 --> 30:38.591
He sees me as a visionary, too, in terms of public 
relations, communications. He kids that I'm his

30:38.652 --> 30:42.356
guru, I'm his public relations guru. Well, it 
really isn't that. He's got a staff and all that.

30:45.647 --> 30:55.422
But we talk and communicate, and I throw ideas at 
him, and sometimes he goes with them, sometimes he

30:45.647 --> 30:55.422
can't go with them, even if he wants to. And I am 
unprecedented about bringing big ideas to him. So

31:01.030 --> 31:13.868
about eight, I kicked myself, I couldn't sell it, 
but about, what was it, eight, ten years ago, I went

31:01.030 --> 31:13.868
to a man named Noguchi, a famous sculptor. The 
Garden in Israel. And somewhere along the line, I

31:17.642 --> 31:22.789
saw in one of his books that he did a children's 
playground out of sculpture. I said, my God, what a

31:23.951 --> 31:27.156
thing that would be for the Woodlands. And have 
Noguchi do a children's playground. I think

31:31.081 --> 31:33.104
people come from all over the world to see it here. 
Well, I think they would. Yeah. And I had a deal

31:34.746 --> 31:36.869
worked out with him. And Noguchi asked me. It would 
take about a quarter of a million dollars to do it. I

31:43.345 --> 31:44.526
went to George with him. He was very interested, in 
fact, to the extent where he started collecting

31:44.546 --> 31:49.090
books on Noguchi and all that. But there was a 
decline right at that point in the energy market.

31:54.014 --> 31:54.855
And he couldn't do it. Cynthia Mitchell said to me 
recently, why didn't you tell me about it? You

31:58.818 --> 32:00.920
know? It may not be too late. Well, he's dead. And 
maybe the concept is still. Well, I'm not giving an

32:07.525 --> 32:09.807
illustration of my brilliance. I'm saying I was 
unhesitant about coming to George with a big idea,

32:13.518 --> 32:21.231
because I know that he would listen, and he 
wouldn't deprecate you for thinking along those

32:13.518 --> 32:21.231
lines. But my work was really not essentially big 
ideas. My work was, first of all, to set the

32:26.139 --> 32:37.679
groundwork for a professional public relations 
firm, a program to communicate what Mitchell

32:26.139 --> 32:37.679
Energy was, essentially to the financial public. 
How did you do that? Well, what I'd like to know in a

32:40.147 --> 32:58.253
way, because neither of us are really all that 
familiar with what a professional public

32:40.147 --> 32:58.253
relations person does, if you could sort of 
outline in general terms what you would do given

32:40.147 --> 32:58.253
that situation and then reflect how that worked in 
the Woodlands, for example, and with Mitchell

32:40.147 --> 32:58.253
Energy and Development. Whenever you're ready.

33:05.023 --> 33:09.630
When you think of what we call financial public 
relations, there are various. arenas that public

33:10.167 --> 33:12.631
relations people work in. One is marketing public 
relations, where you try to sell a product and use

33:12.891 --> 33:20.162
certain techniques along those lines. And I would 
say, in the case of the Woodlands, marketing

33:21.183 --> 33:27.372
public relations mostly comes to bear. Do you want 
a Coke or something? where you try to

33:30.198 --> 33:41.950
get publicity so people will come out here and see 
the project and hopefully buy. You precondition

33:42.450 --> 33:45.954
the audience with exposure. In the case of 
financial public relations, it's a different

33:47.295 --> 33:52.901
approach, yet some of the same techniques apply. 
You have to think of financial public relations as

33:53.301 --> 34:00.188
a distribution system, and out there, are 
security analysts who are really sales promotion

34:00.370 --> 34:04.877
then. Security analyst has stock that he sells. 
And then the consumer is a customer. And so you have

34:14.370 --> 34:17.675
a whole distribution system. You have to get 
information to those people. And it's written, or

34:21.120 --> 34:25.326
it's personal identification, face to face. It's 
annual reports, which they all depend upon and

34:26.167 --> 34:28.871
read. And it's the interim reports. So our 
function was to lay out that kind of a program

34:30.323 --> 34:37.431
first, and then to start doing the things that had 
to be done, mechanical or otherwise. So it meant

34:37.972 --> 34:44.419
help with the preparation of the annual report, 
which is the most important document that goes out

34:37.972 --> 34:44.419
every year. In addition to that, those interim 
statements have to go out. You do publicity in

34:48.764 --> 34:52.408
newspapers, and you have an earnings report. You 
report the earnings to the Dow Jones. It gets on the

34:55.271 --> 34:58.575
broad tape, and it goes out to the newspapers. And 
then you back that up with personal visits,

34:59.112 --> 35:10.667
presentations before security analysts, the 
analyst societies in the major cities, New York

34:59.112 --> 35:10.667
Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange. 
And that meant we had to get George, however

35:10.687 --> 35:18.177
reluctant he felt about it, we had to get him on the 
road to go out and talk to some of those people. We

35:18.237 --> 35:20.019
knew his personality would come to bear. And 
there's nothing that's unprofessional or

35:20.900 --> 35:25.506
improper. It's all part of the distribution. 
setup that we have that's so efficient in the

35:27.968 --> 35:34.455
United States for bringing financial 
information to the people who should know. And of

35:34.496 --> 35:42.164
course the stockholders get the same reports and 
they also read the newspapers. It was important

35:42.305 --> 35:49.513
that we talked to the financial publications like 
Finance and Forbes and other publications like

35:42.305 --> 35:49.513
that. So before long we had a man on our staff who 
traveled the country to the secondary markets And

35:58.242 --> 36:01.927
there are certain markets who are never visited by 
a CEO. Let's say in Lexington, Kentucky, or

36:02.909 --> 36:08.677
Jacksonville, Florida, where there are pockets 
of investors. So what you do is you take a look at the

36:09.538 --> 36:14.024
transfer sheets, and you see where your investors 
are. And you say, well, we've got 20 investors in

36:14.986 --> 36:18.370
Jacksonville. It means they have friends. Maybe 
we ought to go down there and make a report on what

36:19.592 --> 36:23.558
Mitchell is doing now. And there are some 
communities where we know that there are very

36:27.250 --> 36:31.376
important investors, and they don't own any 
shares in Mitchell. And we may select that as the

36:31.977 --> 36:35.803
market that we should make a presentation. And 
what you do sometimes is you approach the security

36:35.823 --> 36:45.217
firm that's making the market for you, your 
principal, underwriter, and say, well, you set up

36:35.823 --> 36:45.217
a meeting for us. Or you go to your bank and say, 
well, you have your affiliate bank in Boston set up

36:46.078 --> 36:50.725
a meeting. Or you go directly to the analyst 
society and say, we can bring George Mitchell

36:51.586 --> 36:56.093
down. and would be happy to make a presentation. 
And we help with the preparation of the

36:59.010 --> 37:05.476
presentation, so that when he goes there, he gives 
the right kind of speech. And we don't write

37:06.377 --> 37:08.459
George's speech. We may help with it. Sure. I don't 
want to give the impression that this is a talking

37:10.762 --> 37:14.705
head. Yeah, that it's canned. Yes, canned, or that 
he doesn't have his own thoughts about it. George

37:19.049 --> 37:22.873
is very, very careful, very critical about things 
people want him to say. Because he has his own

37:24.980 --> 37:30.729
intellectual acuity that he applies to 
everything that you ask him to do. So that was that

37:30.749 --> 37:32.151
program. Then the other program that was parallel 
was reporting on the energy business itself. New

37:39.241 --> 37:40.022
developments. You know, what you do is you write 
news stories or you do brochures or you start to

37:40.904 --> 37:46.252
analyze. Let me put it this way. In every public 
relations campaign, the first thing you do is to do

37:48.495 --> 37:53.923
some research to find out what the public 
perception is of the company. Then you do some

37:57.272 --> 38:01.136
internal interviews to find out the internal 
perception. You work out some kind of adjustment

38:01.736 --> 38:04.779
between the two. If there's an incorrect 
alignment between the two perceptions, you make

38:06.000 --> 38:14.207
an adjustment there. Then you find out what the 
company feels it stands for, how it wants to be

38:15.388 --> 38:23.235
known, what its publics are. make a very careful 
analysis of the people we have to reach. Then we

38:27.108 --> 38:32.134
decide what the most effective means of 
communicating with those publics are. Do you have

38:32.154 --> 38:40.223
difficulty, for example, often maybe, finding 
out what a company really wants to present itself

38:32.154 --> 38:40.223
as and helping to shape that? Well, we use a variety 
of devices. One is we may do focus groups, which we

38:44.889 --> 38:49.554
do frequently, to find out what they really mean. 
Not what they're saying, but what they really

38:49.975 --> 38:51.957
mean. We've used psychologists. We've used a 
whole variety of devices. Or sometimes it gets

38:58.211 --> 39:04.780
down to a one-on-one confrontation between me and 
the CEO. Many times a CEO will hire us, and he's not

39:05.240 --> 39:10.647
quite sure where he's done it, but he thinks he 
needs it. And then he resists it right away. I

39:13.511 --> 39:16.335
assume that might have been the role of George 
Mitchell. Was it, by chance? Well, some of the

39:18.110 --> 39:19.431
things were at play. He knew he needed you, but did 
he know what he wanted you to do? Well, George has

39:21.993 --> 39:27.078
profound perceptions about a lot of things. He 
knew he needed contact with the financial

39:27.378 --> 39:35.325
community, probably his brokerage firm, his 
underwriter told him. And he had certain ideas

39:35.465 --> 39:39.048
about what he wasn't willing to do. Even to this 
day, George doesn't like to go on the road. That's

39:43.532 --> 39:46.615
the last thing in the world that he wants to do is go 
out and be a salesman. for his company, but he will

39:47.017 --> 39:50.782
do it if it's urgent or important. Like the New York 
Stock Exchange, the society there, or Chicago Key

39:50.802 --> 39:57.891
Markets, he will do maybe once a year. But there was 
a time we had a man full-time doing that. And now

40:01.756 --> 40:07.543
there still is a man in the company who's not on my 
staff, on the company staff. Over the years,

40:08.064 --> 40:13.851
Mitchell Energy built up a very capable public 
relations staff whose head until recently was Joe

40:14.337 --> 40:17.520
Cutchin, who was a member of our staff. And 
George's people want to hire him. I'll tell you

40:22.565 --> 40:23.866
that as an aside. That's been reflective of 
George's personality and sense of integrity. At

40:29.072 --> 40:33.276
one point, they decided they needed a public 
relations man internally. His staff was pushing

40:33.336 --> 40:34.717
for it. And George agreed to it. Because there's so 
much going on. Our agency couldn't handle it from

40:37.920 --> 40:40.463
the outside. And I agreed with the concept. They 
interviewed about 20 or 30 people. Finally, one

40:44.573 --> 40:46.034
day George called me. He said, you know, they've 
interviewed all kinds of people. He's the only one

40:48.597 --> 40:51.580
they like is the guy on your staff, like Joe. And I 
said, well, George, what do you want to do? And he

40:54.763 --> 40:58.426
said, well, I told him they can't hire him unless 
you agree. I think that was the benefit of our

40:59.907 --> 41:03.391
personal relationship. He was protecting me. And 
I said, George, what are you going to do for him? Are

41:08.337 --> 41:11.544
you going to enhance his future? Is he going to make 
more money? Does he have stock options? He says,

41:14.750 --> 41:15.211
yes. I said, well, what can I say? I said, are you 
going to keep the agency? He said, of course. And I

41:20.983 --> 41:27.978
said, well, why don't you just give me, maybe 
guarantee our contract at the end of the year or

41:20.983 --> 41:27.978
something. He said, oh, no, that won't be enough. 
He said, at the end of the year, they're going to

41:29.448 --> 41:34.633
come to me and say, well, we got this guy, we got Joe, 
we don't need the agency. So I said, well, what do

41:34.673 --> 41:38.457
you want to do, George? He said, I'm going to give 
you a long-term contract. I think he gave me a

41:41.440 --> 41:48.567
three-year contract at that time, which lasted 
for 20 years, you know, until I retired, you know.

41:50.148 --> 41:57.936
But Joe came in here from our staff, and then we 
appointed another executive who they liked very

41:50.148 --> 41:57.936
well, and we worked on the accounts. And then 
somewhere along the line, I think when I merged my

41:58.709 --> 42:08.604
company and all that, or maybe slightly before 
that, there was no longer need for the company and

41:58.709 --> 42:08.604
the competent staff here. So the firm didn't 
continue except on a sporadic basis. And then when

42:13.952 --> 42:24.328
I retired, George came to me and said, do you think 
you could come down here and help us review what we

42:13.952 --> 42:24.328
do and all that stuff on a regular basis? Yeah, I 
said, I don't have any conflict at that point

42:24.747 --> 42:29.453
because you haven't been a client for a number of 
years. So, you know, my contract stipulates I

42:30.254 --> 42:37.824
guess I can't take an account until after two years 
or something, something crazy. And I'm still on

42:37.844 --> 42:41.028
the payroll of my old agency for another two more 
years. So I've come down there, and first he gave me

42:42.009 --> 42:52.663
the assignment of meeting with energy and with 
real estate, and then little by little I've gotten

42:42.009 --> 42:52.663
into HARC. You know HARC? Yeah, sure. And 
yesterday I ran a seminar for the executives at

42:54.194 --> 42:58.521
Harc on public relations. Did you? Yeah, which is 
fascinating. But going back, switching back,

43:01.025 --> 43:09.197
when George began to talk to me about the 
woodlands, to me it was a fascinating concept. And

43:09.317 --> 43:11.040
when did that occur? Do you remember when this new 
community woodlands idea really emerged? All

43:16.402 --> 43:19.145
during the time I knew him, he talked about it. He 
said that this came in part out of his New

43:19.866 --> 43:27.835
Presidents Association contacts.

43:28.616 --> 43:31.360
I think Woodlands is what? You probably know 
better than I. It's probably in this book. I can

43:35.524 --> 43:36.706
give you an idea. He started turning this over 
somewhere in the 60s. Of course, the Woodlands, I

43:39.950 --> 43:45.396
guess, as an entity, began about 1969, 1974. But 
somewhere before that, he's . Oh, before that, he

43:48.803 --> 43:51.145
was talking about it, sure. If you tell me, if I can 
remember when they went public, which I can't at

43:51.906 --> 43:56.490
the moment. We can find that out. That's all right. 
That was about the time I'll find it. But as we spent

44:00.214 --> 44:15.889
time together and began to talk about the concept, 
and what amazed me, absolutely amazed me, was how

44:00.214 --> 44:15.889
he was approaching it from a standpoint of 
safeguarding the environment and bringing the

44:00.214 --> 44:15.889
best people that he could find. you know, that deal 
with the preservation of the environment, the way

44:15.987 --> 44:24.456
out of the woodlands, the safety, safe streets. He 
was creating a perfect home environment. If I were

44:27.159 --> 44:30.763
fresh at that point in my life, I'd have moved into 
the woodlands. My God, plenty offered there.

44:33.025 --> 44:41.434
Perfect schooling for the kids, you know, and for 
preservation of flora and fauna, recreation,

44:33.025 --> 44:41.434
unlimited recreational activities. I'm a 
golfer. My God, they have three golf courses that

44:42.174 --> 44:44.577
are available, you know. And you can buy a house 
down here for half the price of what I have to pay

44:44.995 --> 44:50.260
elsewhere. Beautiful homes. I know what I get for 
3,000 feet in the Palm Springs area. If you're

44:59.470 --> 45:07.398
spending anywhere from $700,000 to a million, 
3,000 feet, or you might spend $350,000 at the most

44:59.470 --> 45:07.398
here. At least I think so. Yeah, but at any rate, I 
was just so excited about what he was doing, so

45:11.101 --> 45:21.092
that's where he turned down the juices, and I tried 
to give as many ideas as I could and as much

45:11.101 --> 45:21.092
leadership. I would say George got something out 
of me that I couldn't give to a lot of our clients. At

45:25.637 --> 45:32.885
one point we had 150 clients, and I would only 
select a handful of clients I would personally

45:25.637 --> 45:32.885
work with. In all cases, on the Mitchell account, I 
was on the top of the heap, because I was

45:32.925 --> 45:41.074
interfacing with George and with the executives 
here. At times it was rough going because people

45:41.341 --> 45:50.009
were concerned about my close personal 
relationship with George if they had to work with

45:41.341 --> 45:50.009
me.

45:53.293 --> 46:06.105
Because I had George's ear more than some people 
could get, and his confidence, and sometimes they

45:53.293 --> 46:06.105
were reluctant to talk to me about things that they 
wouldn't want George to hear. So that's always the

46:06.485 --> 46:11.230
case. You mean within the company? Within a 
company, when you're very close to the top. I very

46:16.991 --> 46:20.757
seldom had familial relationships with clients. 
We didn't try to achieve that at all. Just a small

46:24.122 --> 46:25.424
handful of people. And it had to develop 
automatically. The wives had to like each other

46:27.427 --> 46:29.110
first. If they don't, then you're dead. You're 
going to be killed. And then you have to want to do

46:32.916 --> 46:38.324
things with one another, with the CEO, out of the 
business. You want to spend time. George and I have

46:40.302 --> 46:43.085
traveled the world together, our families. I'm 
not only George's PR guru, I'm his restaurant

46:45.367 --> 46:49.331
grazer.

46:53.856 --> 46:55.278
I'm his grazer. When we go on a trip, first of all, 
George doesn't like to travel, and since we have a

46:55.298 --> 47:09.212
comfortable relationship, if he finds out that 
we're thinking of doing it too, it's mostly in

46:55.298 --> 47:09.212
connection meetings of the senior YPO 
organization CEO. We know a convention is going on

47:13.673 --> 47:20.089
and my wife will say, maybe we ought to take a 
post-convention trip. They frequently offer

47:20.109 --> 47:22.094
trips. After the five-day convention, you might 
go off somewhere with the group.
