00:01.904 --> 00:10.414
This is Eric Norgello talking with Evelyn Butler 
at Austin City Planning Department concerning

00:01.904 --> 00:10.414
planning history in Austin. You've been with 
Austin City Planning Department for how long now,

00:11.876 --> 00:16.141
Ms. Butler? About 25 and a half years. 25 and a half 
years, all right. And prior to that, had you worked

00:20.526 --> 00:23.270
in any other planning departments? Has all your 
experience been with Austin? All of it has been

00:25.012 --> 00:26.353
with Austin. I did work one summer while I was at the 
University of Texas with the Planning Department

00:30.676 --> 00:34.764
here in Austin. Beginning with these preliminary 
questions, which we are just now looking over,

00:34.784 --> 00:44.923
could you tell me when the first legislative 
authorization of a comprehensive plan was in

00:34.784 --> 00:44.923
Austin? When you're talking about legislative 
authorization, I'm sure that you consider that to

00:45.524 --> 00:50.894
be the state. And I do not have that date. And the 
same would go for legislative authorization of

00:54.942 --> 01:01.533
planning, not just the document for Austin. Well, 
we have the city charter, which established the

01:01.553 --> 01:16.697
planning commission and the authority of the 
planning commission to authorize

01:01.553 --> 01:16.697
and have a master plan prepared. I don't have that 
exact date, but I might be able to pick that up for

01:17.200 --> 01:26.512
you. I do have the charter here. And

01:31.458 --> 01:41.071
they have the amendments here, but I don't think 
they have the date on when that first went into

01:31.458 --> 01:41.071
effect. But it was authorized by the city charter.

01:46.698 --> 01:50.423
Throughout the years, Austin City has adopted a 
number of comprehensive plans. Could you tell me

01:50.923 --> 01:53.627
what the dates of these various plans were? There 
have been a number of plans that have been

01:53.687 --> 01:56.971
prepared. There was no comprehensive plan 
adopted until June 8, 1961. We had pieces that were

02:06.424 --> 02:08.146
adopted. We had pieces that were used some, but 
were never adopted. We had a plan that was prepared

02:12.772 --> 02:15.996
by Cook and Fowler in 19... 27, 28, and I think that 
that was used as a guide even though there was no

02:16.195 --> 02:25.004
official action taken that I can find. Then in 1950 
there was a plan that was generally prepared by

02:26.786 --> 02:46.185
Farron Granger and I think as a result of the work 
that they did the City Council adopted a

02:26.786 --> 02:46.185
thoroughfare plan and that just set out the 
widths, the right-of-way widths and locations of

02:46.756 --> 02:52.905
a limited number of thoroughfares. After that 
date, nothing was done until the city authorized

02:54.187 --> 03:09.591
consultants to be hired to prepare a new 
comprehensive plan or master plan for Austin.

03:10.448 --> 03:20.780
Work was started on it in the mid-50s, and the work 
was completed, I believe, in 1958. The plan went

03:22.061 --> 03:24.845
through a series of public hearings. It was 
modified substantially before it was adopted in

03:26.206 --> 03:32.654
1961.

03:34.776 --> 03:39.882
After that date, we have ended up with a new 
comprehensive plan But prior to that plan coming

03:40.587 --> 03:51.813
about, there were two amendments to the 
transportation section of the 61 plan. The

03:53.537 --> 03:56.925
highway department jointly with the city and the 
county conducted a transportation study and this

03:58.441 --> 04:20.168
transportation study resulted in the expressway 
and major arterial plan for Austin which replaced

03:58.441 --> 04:20.168
the 61 thoroughfare plan and it was first adopted 
in 67 and it was updated and adopted again with

03:58.441 --> 04:20.168
revisions in 1969. That plan has been used up until 
The new comprehensive plan came out, and we have

04:26.386 --> 04:37.763
now a roadway, Austin Metropolitan roadway plan 
that was adopted just a few months ago.

04:41.069 --> 04:41.509
Let's see. You mentioned that the adopted 
comprehensive plans in Austin have been revised

04:42.471 --> 04:47.719
from time to time. Could you tell me how this 
revision takes place? Any applicant or city

04:50.095 --> 05:06.456
agency who might feel that change is in order for 
the plan, whether the 61 plan covered land use as

04:50.095 --> 05:06.456
well as the transportation system. Whenever we 
had a proposal for deviation from that plan

05:06.596 --> 05:19.613
covering a fairly major area, we came through with 
what we called a master plan change.

05:22.090 --> 05:26.958
accepted an application from whoever wanted to 
change the plan. We prepared maps. We sent out

05:30.283 --> 05:39.318
memos to all the departments to find out how that 
would affect their area of responsibility. Then

05:40.920 --> 05:42.583
we held the public hearing. We would have the 
individual notices to people immediately around

05:42.924 --> 05:49.414
the area. and newspaper notice for the hearing. 
The hearing would be held before the Planning

05:54.965 --> 06:03.594
Commission and then their recommendation would 
be passed on to the City Council and the City

05:54.965 --> 06:03.594
Council would take action.

06:06.858 --> 06:15.807
We

06:06.858 --> 06:15.807
have had a series of changes both in land use and in 
thoroughfare locations. Is there any

06:17.491 --> 06:22.960
systematic, periodic review of the city's 
comprehensive plan? It was scheduled to be

06:22.980 --> 06:42.110
reviewed annually, but it was not followed 
through in that sense for the simple reason that as

06:22.980 --> 06:42.110
people saw problems with the plan, the amendments 
were brought up whenever the need arose rather

06:22.980 --> 06:42.110
than waiting for an annual review. The new plan, 
there will be I think review of that, I think we'll

06:45.554 --> 06:55.767
be following a schedule in regard to reevaluating 
the new comprehensive plan. So Austin's found

06:56.167 --> 07:02.936
that it's more feasible to revise a plan as needed 
rather than on a regularly scheduled basis? Not

07:02.956 --> 07:03.917
necessarily. We have always felt that review 
would be the best because that way then you can look

07:04.678 --> 07:15.291
at the overall picture rather than at just one 
area. Now, there are some modifications that

07:15.676 --> 07:34.079
would not call for a complete review, but there are 
others that can be very, very influential

07:15.676 --> 07:34.079
on other areas, and it should not be done on a 
piecemeal basis. How is this review undertaken,

07:34.680 --> 07:38.164
then? The review... The process itself. The 
process itself would be that if we had an area that

07:45.680 --> 07:55.830
was developing with development pressures that 
would not, say, meet the comprehensive plan. And

07:57.031 --> 08:15.568
we would feel as though that maybe the 
comprehensive plan did not take some of these

07:57.031 --> 08:15.568
things into consideration, possibly because we 
did not have the knowledge at the time it was

07:57.031 --> 08:15.568
prepared, or possibly because we've had other 
pressures from outside investments. that were

08:15.869 --> 08:18.833
not known at the time the plan was prepared. I think 
that this can be evidenced by the number of

08:19.914 --> 08:28.985
environmental concerns that have been raised in 
recent years. We have come up with a series of new

08:29.605 --> 08:40.138
ordinances that have covered, say, our Lake 
Austin watershed in order to maintain our safe

08:40.439 --> 08:47.048
water supply because Lake Austin provides Austin 
with the drinking water. We have some very

08:48.250 --> 08:59.545
sensitive aquifers in the Austin area and we have 
had a series of ordinances that are

09:02.528 --> 09:11.957
key to the environmental issue and the 
maintaining of the aquifers so that we do not end up

09:02.528 --> 09:11.957
with pollutants entering the aquifer. So in those 
areas, even though the plans as we've gone through

09:13.259 --> 09:24.090
them through the years, some of this information 
was not readily available. We've had new

09:24.290 --> 09:25.591
technology. We've had new interests as far as 
environmental concerns.

09:31.638 --> 09:32.479
have been raised. And so I think we ended up, even 
though our plan, the 61 plan, I think, was intended

09:32.980 --> 09:41.251
to go into the 80s. And of course, we didn't adopt 
the new plan, I don't believe, until 79. No, let's

09:44.795 --> 09:47.880
see, it might have been early 1980. But we'd had so 
many changes in the interim that a number of the

09:49.522 --> 10:01.037
land uses, for instance, were really no longer 
valid.

10:04.763 --> 10:19.376
Would you say that looking at past history of 
planning here, that Austin conducts its planning

10:04.763 --> 10:19.376
in a comprehensive manner, or would you 
characterize it in a different type of way, such as

10:04.763 --> 10:19.376
incremental planning, radical planning, 
response to crises, or something like that? Well,

10:20.216 --> 10:25.201
I don't think that we can put it into one specific 
category. Austin, I think, has made every effort

10:25.961 --> 10:31.446
to go in for the comprehensive planning for the 
city. We have... had the review of, for instance,

10:35.003 --> 10:47.943
the plans, as I've mentioned, the thoroughfare 
plan, and we have tried to do that on an entire city

10:35.003 --> 10:47.943
and area-wide basis. We have worked with other 
communities that abut our ETJ or where we might

10:48.064 --> 10:58.520
have overlaps of ETJ. We have worked with them on a 
long-range concept to where we can work together.

11:06.832 --> 11:18.946
I think that we generally would fall into the 
category of the comprehensive rather than the

11:06.832 --> 11:18.946
either radical or incremental. Now there are 
times when we have, say, some development

11:19.346 --> 11:26.054
pressures when an industry wants to come in. And I 
feel as though that that is where we... might

11:31.130 --> 11:45.051
consider the incremental for the simple reason 
that if the industry had not been anticipated in

11:31.130 --> 11:45.051
the early stages, then we find that that industry 
can have quite an impact on the community. And we

11:45.652 --> 11:55.487
many times have a very short review time of how that 
industry would impact the community. We make

11:55.867 --> 11:58.892
every effort to go into review of the utility 
situation, the traffic situation that would be

11:59.480 --> 12:07.610
generated by it, and the effect on existing 
development. And I think that the work that has

12:07.630 --> 12:16.761
been done in regard to a number of these industries 
has been fairly comprehensive. Do you happen to

12:18.243 --> 12:21.246
recall when the first zoning ordinance was in 
Austin? I think that it was in the mid-20s. I don't

12:25.832 --> 12:29.436
have the exact date for you, and I would like to get 
that for you. Would you happen to know if zoning

12:31.306 --> 12:38.776
ordinances happened to be enacted before the city 
had a comprehensive plan? I think they were. What

12:41.820 --> 12:45.304
would be the basis of that kind of authority for 
zoning then? That, I can't give you the history. I

12:48.709 --> 12:49.490
wish I could. But I think the idea was that there 
would be certain places that businesses were

12:51.493 --> 13:00.925
located on major streets and I think that some of 
the early zoning took place by strip zoning

13:01.040 --> 13:08.092
because they felt as though this is where the 
activity would take place. What administrative

13:09.715 --> 13:16.306
procedures and planning program elements does 
your community presently have for implementing

13:09.715 --> 13:16.306
community plans? What do you mean by community 
plans? Comprehensive plans. All right. The

13:23.298 --> 13:27.064
implementation of the comprehensive plan goes 
back to zoning ordinance, subdivision

13:27.483 --> 13:52.395
ordinance, the capital improvements program, 
and then there are a number of individual plans

13:27.483 --> 13:52.395
like public facilities plan, fire service, or I'm 
not sure what the title is, but fire station

13:27.483 --> 13:52.395
location plan, and we have a parks and recreation 
plan. And all of these tie back into the CIP

13:52.856 --> 13:57.422
program, and the funding that would be required to 
implement these plans. When did Austin City first

14:04.165 --> 14:06.908
establish a planning department?

14:14.175 --> 14:23.865
I believe the planning department was 
established in 1949 or 50.

14:26.663 --> 14:31.630
And at present, could you tell me approximately 
how many professional planners the city employs?

14:32.611 --> 14:33.132
At this time?

14:37.838 --> 14:39.200
I'd have to check the number. I think that I 
could... Could I give this to you a little later in

14:39.700 --> 14:45.188
the interview? Sure. Or could you cut this off, and 
I think I can get... The number of planners,

14:49.732 --> 15:07.974
professional planners, that we have on staff now, 
including our administration, would be 24, and

14:49.732 --> 15:07.974
this can fluctuate 24, 26, right in that area 
because we are short two at the present time. And

15:08.955 --> 15:15.283
this

15:08.955 --> 15:15.283
covers advanced planning and current planning. 
Has the size of the department over the years

15:15.736 --> 15:20.541
expanded to meet the needs of the city? We had a 
little expansion, not very much. Our workload has

15:23.964 --> 15:33.052
continued to grow, and actually our staff has not 
grown as much as our workload has grown. So you

15:33.633 --> 15:37.757
would say you had approximately the same size 
staff five years ago? Oh, it might vary two or

15:37.777 --> 15:41.360
three, not very many. We were authorized a new 
person just within the last couple of months

15:44.744 --> 16:05.034
because we have added a new section to the zoning 
ordinance which calls for review of all site plans

15:44.744 --> 16:05.034
for development along some of our major roadways. 
We also had the Barton Creek ordinance which was

16:05.895 --> 16:14.548
implemented and we were authorized a new position 
to help implement that ordinance. So we have

16:17.081 --> 16:23.118
expanded a little, but not as rapidly as our 
workload has expanded. Could you give me some

16:24.001 --> 16:28.453
information on the organizational structure of 
the planning department here? We actually have

16:28.872 --> 16:33.700
two sections within the department at this time. 
We have the current planning section and the

16:34.121 --> 16:37.287
advanced planning section. And we consider the 
administration, our director, assistant

16:38.268 --> 16:48.366
director, and the supporting staff for that 
administrative function. The advanced planning

16:48.650 --> 17:05.631
section normally carries through, say, the 
writing and preparation of the comprehensive

16:48.650 --> 17:05.631
plan, and they are responsible for a number of 
studies in relation to implementing that plan.

17:06.612 --> 17:11.818
The current planning section takes care of the 
day-to-day operation. The current planning

17:13.420 --> 17:17.425
section actually is divided up into three 
subsections. subdivision processing,

17:18.299 --> 17:24.185
subdivision design, and zoning. Now, I do have 
another more or less support section for both of

17:24.645 --> 17:30.611
those, which is the drafting section. And that 
gives me an idea on chain of command within each of

17:32.012 --> 17:35.035
the sections. Right. But within the current 
planning, there are, in other words, all the

17:36.056 --> 17:41.421
day-to-day operations. Now, we do have some 
crossover, even though the drafting section is

17:41.481 --> 17:47.327
under the supervision of current planning. It 
still does some work for advanced planning.

17:50.713 --> 17:54.279
Advanced planning carries out some studies that 
benefit us. They have an artist on their staff, and

17:55.221 --> 18:06.941
so some preparation in regard to some of our 
publications might be done by advanced planning,

17:55.221 --> 18:06.941
so we do have quite a bit of crossover. Could you 
give me an idea as to relationship of the planning

18:08.564 --> 18:12.471
department and its legislative body, that is the 
Planning Commission, and what type of member

18:12.873 --> 18:25.576
within the department acts as liaison and some 
ideas to communication within the two bodies? All

18:25.957 --> 18:26.298
right. Actually, the Planning Department is the 
staff for the Planning Commission. Mr. Lilly, our

18:32.289 --> 18:35.775
director, is the executive secretary of the 
Planning Commission, and we're responsible for

18:36.245 --> 18:47.361
maintaining all the records, minutes, and the 
support for the public hearings conducted by the

18:36.245 --> 18:47.361
Planning Commission. So, actually, Mr. Lilly 
appears at, I'd say, the majority of the Planning

18:47.462 --> 18:54.352
Commission meetings. We do have other staff. We 
have subdivision processing planner appearing

19:02.333 --> 19:03.634
in regard to subdivisions. We have several zoning 
staff members appearing for the Planning

19:04.175 --> 19:24.078
Commission meetings that hold the public 
hearings on zoning, special permits, the

19:04.175 --> 19:24.078
principal roadway area, historic zoning, which 
also goes through the Landmark Commission.

19:26.761 --> 19:28.543
How would you describe the relationship of the 
Planning Department and various citizen groups

19:29.148 --> 19:35.059
that try to impact the advice that's given to the 
Planning Commission? I think it's excellent. We,

19:37.564 --> 19:48.625
of course, have had some concerns raised by 
citizen groups at times that they feel as though

19:37.564 --> 19:48.625
they don't get as much information as they would 
like to have.

19:50.309 --> 19:52.237
send out information to them. We have a list of 
neighborhood associations that I think total

19:52.920 --> 19:59.307
close to 100. And we notify the neighborhood 
association affected on each zoning case if there

20:00.198 --> 20:09.028
is one. I mean, if there is an association, they're 
given a notice just like a property owner would be

20:09.929 --> 20:14.854
given notice. How well organized are these 
neighborhood action groups? Some of them are very

20:18.418 --> 20:20.480
well organized. Others have organized as a result 
of, say, a zoning issue that they are unhappy with.

20:28.629 --> 20:30.171
And so that... many times initiates the 
development of the neighborhood association. Do

20:35.560 --> 20:53.205
you find that in your contact with these 
neighborhood groups, they seem to be interested

20:35.560 --> 20:53.205
in specific neighborhood aerial interests, or 
they have a broader perspective, let's say a

20:35.560 --> 20:53.205
comprehensive view of the city and its city's 
needs in that? I would say that a few of them have

20:53.225 --> 20:57.812
indicated that they have an interest in the entire 
city. There are some that have appeared on issues

21:00.767 --> 21:18.012
that are outside of their immediate 
neighborhood, but there are others who are just

21:00.767 --> 21:18.012
very neighborhood-oriented and they're 
concerned only when their own area is threatened.

21:20.438 --> 21:27.891
Within any city, significant events 
historically will impact the city in many ways,

21:20.438 --> 21:27.891
planning being one of them. Looking at some of the 
different types of events that can impact a city's

21:28.933 --> 21:42.075
planning, could you tell me something about the 
founding of the city of Boston and whether it was

21:28.933 --> 21:42.075
planned and how planning was later affected by its 
founding? Well, I think that when Austin was first

21:44.283 --> 21:50.313
laid out, we had some very... This was when? I wish 
you had not asked me that question. In checking

21:56.202 --> 22:02.292
records, I find that it was actually, the city was 
incorporated in December of 1839.

22:04.617 --> 22:09.809
Do you happen to know if the city was planned at that 
time, whether there was any kind of a layout for

22:04.617 --> 22:09.809
streets or design? There was a layout. I think that 
that might have come a little bit later, because I

22:11.493 --> 22:20.314
vaguely remember a map that's labeled 1840. that 
shows the downtown area. It shows out the laying

22:24.360 --> 22:35.556
out of Congress, East Avenue, West Avenue, and the 
original outlocks for the city of Austin. And I

22:35.576 --> 22:45.610
believe that's, it might be dated 1839, but 
somewhere or other I feel as though, and it could be

22:35.576 --> 22:45.610
tied to the date that it was officially built. 
settled, and I could get that information for you

22:45.893 --> 22:50.338
and maybe provide you with a copy of that map. Has 
the city of Austin been influenced in a planning

22:52.301 --> 23:02.292
sense by city fairs or county fairs or larger 
expositions or major conventions over the years?

23:03.534 --> 23:06.057
Not in, I don't think, a major sense. I think that 
there were some celebrations in the early days,

23:06.157 --> 23:15.428
but I don't think that they were that extensive, 
and I just don't recall enough history on that to be

23:15.796 --> 23:23.447
able to respond adequately. During the frontier 
period, could you tell me what functions the city

23:24.950 --> 23:32.641
of Austin performed in relationship to the state 
or to the West? Of course, the capital of the state.

23:35.485 --> 23:37.048
That's the primary function. I think that because 
it had a very central location being located on the

23:37.769 --> 23:44.098
Colorado River, It was one of the trading posts for 
a lot of areas around Austin. I feel as though that

23:53.891 --> 24:03.503
with the railroad coming to Austin, it really 
functioned as a hub for Central Texas. That's my

24:04.044 --> 24:06.066
next question on the coming of the railroad. How 
did this impact planning in Austin? Well, one

24:08.429 --> 24:21.367
thing, because our transportation system was 
keyed more to railroad than anything else, the

24:08.429 --> 24:21.367
very best homes in Austin were built close to the 
railroad. That's not the way it is today, but it was

24:22.769 --> 24:32.783
then, and we have some very old historic homes that 
were constructed close to the railroad facility.

24:34.670 --> 24:41.585
During world wars, typically, United States 
governments have established military bases

24:34.670 --> 24:41.585
that didn't exist previously. An influx of 
population will impact the area. Did Austin have

24:44.933 --> 24:48.561
any problems with this and have to plan for that? 
Austin actually, I think, participated in as much

24:49.132 --> 25:03.010
as I understand that the Bergstrom Air Force Base, 
that the land was given by the city of Austin to the

24:49.132 --> 25:03.010
government for the base. And I think that there's 
always been a very good relationship between the

25:03.791 --> 25:10.380
city of Austin and the Air Force Base. We have, of 
course, a number of people who have been brought

25:10.917 --> 25:30.590
here as a result of it, and it has had, I think, a very 
long-range effect on Austin, inasmuch as so many

25:10.917 --> 25:30.590
people who come to Austin by way of Bergstrom find 
that Austin is one of the most delightful places to

25:10.917 --> 25:30.590
live. And when they retire, even though they might 
have been transferred to another section of the

25:31.552 --> 25:36.300
country, We have a number of people, military 
people, who have come back to Austin to retire. It

25:43.416 --> 25:46.680
also affects our employment. This department has 
a number of retired Air Force

25:47.942 --> 25:56.914
people working in it at the present time. They have 
gone on to start a second profession after they

25:57.494 --> 26:05.545
have completed their training well, tour of duty 
or whatever you might want to call it. And they have

26:09.522 --> 26:20.359
started a second career, and they are, I think, 
functioning very well in the employment market as

26:09.522 --> 26:20.359
well as in the retirement. Did the number of people 
coming with Bergstrom Air Force Base entail any

26:21.601 --> 26:32.258
special planning needs as regards that area of the 
city and service provision?

26:35.343 --> 26:40.353
I'm sure it did affect a good bit of planning in the 
early days. It was before I came here, and I'm not

26:40.554 --> 26:49.251
sure how much of an impact it had at that time when it 
first came. In later years, it has affected

26:49.535 --> 27:03.113
housing development because the personnel had to 
be on call so that they could reach the base within a

26:49.535 --> 27:03.113
certain number of minutes, I believe. And so I 
think that it helped increase the population in

27:03.653 --> 27:10.362
the South Austin area. I think that is another 
reason that since we had so many military people

27:10.797 --> 27:34.054
living in that area, there was a delay in getting as 
many, say, shopping centers in South Austin as we

27:10.797 --> 27:34.054
had in North Austin and other areas because a lot of 
their shopping was done on the base, and even

27:10.797 --> 27:34.054
though we had the residential development, The 
commercial development really did not quite meet

27:34.304 --> 27:41.231
the same standards as it did in other areas. Now, I 
don't think that that is quite the case anymore

27:41.671 --> 27:56.326
because as our population has grown, I don't think 
the Bergstrom population has grown as fast as the

27:41.671 --> 27:56.326
other population, so that's beginning to balance 
out. Can you see even at this point or the point

27:57.467 --> 28:00.750
where you... in the 1950s when you joined the 
department, any transportation needs that were

28:01.220 --> 28:09.553
impacted by coming to the Air Force Base, 
thoroughfares widening? Well, we did have, for

28:09.854 --> 28:20.491
instance, Riverside Drive was a county lane, and 
that was one of the main streets that was used by

28:09.854 --> 28:20.491
Bergstrom personnel to come into Austin. And, of 
course, I think that More than likely, the

28:25.098 --> 28:33.909
Montopolis interchange had the need for it, was 
generated partially by Bergstrom. And I think

28:33.929 --> 28:41.099
that the need for building up Riverside Drive was 
partially by Bergstrom. But again, it's just a

28:41.419 --> 28:44.423
small percentage in the overall. The Great 
Depression in the 1930s and the New Deal programs

28:46.529 --> 28:54.449
that were enacted to deal with the problem had a 
great impact on many cities. For example, WPA

28:54.510 --> 29:00.545
projects, funding for planning and development. 
What role did this play in planning in Austin? The

29:04.231 --> 29:11.199
only thing that I can give you without doing some 
research is that we did have a number of WPA

29:04.231 --> 29:11.199
projects. I think that some of the facilities out 
in Zilker Park were built at that time.

29:20.411 --> 29:32.145
I know that there were a number of things that 
happened throughout Austin during that period,

29:20.411 --> 29:32.145
and I do not have the exact locations, but we did 
benefit, I think, indirectly from the WPA

29:32.682 --> 29:35.947
activity. Can you think of any public buildings or 
city buildings that were constructed as a result

29:36.548 --> 29:41.936
of WPA funding? Well, I think the ones in Zilker 
Park are the main ones that I can think of. City

29:46.903 --> 29:50.168
administration buildings or city hall or 
anything like that? I don't think so. I don't

29:51.410 --> 29:53.914
believe so. The urban renewal era in late 60s and 
early to mid 1970s, what impact did that have on

29:55.784 --> 30:04.390
planning in Austin and development here? Well, I 
would say that it had quite a bit of impact inasmuch

30:08.980 --> 30:12.886
as urban renewal was used in a number of areas. We 
had a series of projects. One was called the

30:15.349 --> 30:19.235
Bracken Ridge Urban Renewal Area. That was for the 
expansion of Bracken Ridge Hospital and the

30:19.315 --> 30:24.603
related area. We used urban renewal for the 
expansion of the university. Then there were

30:30.652 --> 30:37.502
several projects in East Austin that did not tie 
into the public agency need. that were for the

30:38.528 --> 30:40.150
neighborhoods.

30:43.394 --> 30:51.424
I think urban renewal has mixed

30:43.394 --> 30:51.424
reception here in Austin.

30:52.926 --> 31:00.956
We had a number of people who were

30:52.926 --> 31:00.956
displaced in the university area. They would have 
been displaced whether it had come under urban

31:02.077 --> 31:06.983
renewal or otherwise because the university did 
have the right of eminent domain and they could

31:07.418 --> 31:19.742
have expanded and the legislature had already

31:07.418 --> 31:19.742
decided that the property would be acquired. And 
one reason that urban renewal was used...
