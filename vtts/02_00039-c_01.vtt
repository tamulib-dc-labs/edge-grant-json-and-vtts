00:02.056 --> 00:26.014
In hindsight, now given the benefit of your experience, you think that organization of having the two, are there any, in looking back on that total experience, are there any agencies or units that were not under one of those two vice presidents today, as far as you know?

00:26.074 --> 00:27.256
Not that I can think of.

00:27.276 --> 00:27.937
That ought to be.

00:28.538 --> 00:29.700
Oh, that ought to be?

00:30.743 --> 00:41.946
No, I really don't think so, because if you rule out the other vice presidential areas, such as your academics and Bob Walker's operation and what have you, everything else is under one of those two.

00:42.708 --> 00:44.090
And is the other true?

00:44.111 --> 00:50.203
Is there anything under one of those two that ought to be reporting something?

00:50.892 --> 00:51.894
Not that I can think of.

00:51.994 --> 01:06.355
I think the organization the way it's established now as I understand it and the way it was before is I think as good as you can get because you got a check and balance.

01:06.375 --> 01:09.079
Before there was no check and balance when they were combined.

01:09.861 --> 01:16.731
Now the reason it worked so well because Tom Cherry and Howard Vestal were there was because of Tom Cherry and Howard Vestal.

01:17.318 --> 01:21.603
Do you remember any particular crises that they dealt with and how they dealt with them?

01:24.526 --> 01:26.588
Of course the budget was always our big problem.

01:26.988 --> 01:33.956
We had a budget battle every session and every biennium we had to go to Austin to do testifying.

01:35.418 --> 01:40.423
But getting our budgets approved was always a big problem.

01:41.213 --> 01:47.513
And, of course, we had to justify it to them, and they, in turn, had to justify it to higher-ups, and ultimately to the board.

01:47.895 --> 01:53.232
And I'm assuming that one of the central factors in those problems was the growth of the enrollment

01:53.701 --> 01:56.184
and appropriations coming after.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.467
Chicken and egg situation, absolutely.

01:58.648 --> 02:06.258
You know, you can't get the appropriations without the enrollment, but once you get the enrollment, it's too late to build the infrastructure.

02:06.779 --> 02:11.925
Our deferred maintenance program in the physical plant, for example, was just horrendous, and I'm sure it probably still is till this day.

02:12.747 --> 02:22.780
Do you remember anything, any way money was spent or for what it was spent, which now in hindsight

02:23.637 --> 02:28.303
would cause you to say, if I hadn't realized it then, we wouldn't have done it that way?

02:29.184 --> 02:36.894
Was there any place where NM was spending some money that perhaps we shouldn't have spent money from this source for that purpose?

02:36.914 --> 02:38.796
Nothing that stands out in my mind, Haskell.

02:40.939 --> 02:44.163
I'm not aware of anything that we would have done a whole lot differently.

02:44.663 --> 02:48.328
Did we take any auxiliary enterprise money

02:48.950 --> 02:53.995
and spend it somewhere outside auxiliary enterprises area, which I presume would have been legal.

02:54.596 --> 02:56.798
It would have been legal, but I'm not aware that it ever happened.

02:57.439 --> 03:11.274
I do know that if within auxiliary enterprise areas that you needed to transfer some funds, I don't remember any specific examples, but that would be probably a very reasonable thing to do.

03:11.674 --> 03:18.822
Which of the enterprises, auxiliary enterprises, was the most likely to have trouble paying it some way?

03:21.282 --> 03:24.546
Shuttle bus operation was touch and go for a long time.

03:25.467 --> 03:40.403
I remember when I made that presentation to the board, Dean Hubert was in the meeting and he says, you know, of all my years in public education, the thing that I have nightmares about is the bus operation.

03:41.885 --> 03:45.569
And, but he said, but I'll, I think that, go ahead and give it a try.

03:45.589 --> 03:47.511
But he said, I don't think it's ever going to work.

03:48.492 --> 03:51.255
Which was always the most constant

03:52.197 --> 03:55.861
positive operation financially?

03:55.881 --> 03:56.521
Food service.

03:57.242 --> 03:59.524
And I would say so primarily because of Fred Dollar.

03:59.805 --> 04:03.668
Fred was just an unbelievably fine administrator.

04:04.850 --> 04:10.816
And, of course, he could set the board rates to make sure that he always had adequate funds.

04:11.616 --> 04:11.897
All right.

04:12.717 --> 04:18.163
In the beginning of this question, I'm giving you omnipotence in this matter.

04:18.203 --> 04:20.365
When I interviewed him, he said one of the

04:21.205 --> 04:45.222
proposals that he always had tucked away in his insides that he wished the A&M academic leadership would have approved would have been an academic program in food service because we were so big, so many students worked in it, and the market for those people would have been so good.

04:45.792 --> 04:50.820
Do you remember that ever being discussed at the higher level?

04:51.361 --> 04:52.723
Not food service per se.

04:52.743 --> 04:58.092
Now, University of Houston has a hotel and food service management course.

04:59.033 --> 05:08.188
Also, Fred always had, I think he called it a bakery seminar or something where people would come in and it was a very successful program, but that was almost

05:08.573 --> 05:11.977
like training people that were already in the food service business.

05:12.037 --> 05:18.844
But I don't remember that ever being discussed as a possible academic endeavor.

05:19.225 --> 05:22.348
The way he told it to me was not the hotel management.

05:22.629 --> 05:23.990
Yes, it was strictly food service.

05:24.010 --> 05:24.591
Food service.

05:24.871 --> 05:28.355
I don't remember that ever being proposed as an academic endeavor.

05:28.555 --> 05:37.585
Well, what he threw out to me was, think how logical it would be for someone to have worked in the food service program here,

05:37.919 --> 05:45.571
to have got a major in that and then to go to work for one of the fast food places or one of the restaurant chains and so forth.

05:46.172 --> 05:53.945
Okay, do you remember your first impressions of Jack Williams?

05:53.965 --> 06:04.281
I would say that my first impression would be that he was a highly intelligent, very compassionate person that almost

06:06.488 --> 06:16.261
as I would picture somebody being in the men's of society, that he was such a brain that he was just kind of above the rest of us earthlings.

06:17.903 --> 06:24.071
Not an arrogant person, but still, I don't even want to use the word aloof because that's not a good word.

06:24.812 --> 06:33.203
But he was just, you know, he was for real what I considered just an outstanding administrator, but also a highly intelligent individual.

06:35.406 --> 06:36.187
All right.

06:36.207 --> 06:36.327
Any...

06:36.863 --> 06:46.954
in your responsibility, regardless of what level it was during his years, can you give any examples of his decision making, his judgment and so forth?

06:48.175 --> 06:55.924
Not really, because when he was there, I was far enough down on the totem pole that I really didn't have any occasion to really know.

06:57.405 --> 07:00.969
I'm sure Howard Vestal and Tom Cherry would have a lot to say in that area.

07:01.109 --> 07:03.732
Now, does Mr. Cherry retire during the Williams years?

07:06.142 --> 07:11.787
I believe he does because when I went in as Howard Vessels, Associate Vice President, Ludicke was in.

07:13.529 --> 07:15.170
And you said, oh, oh, okay.

07:15.190 --> 07:15.731
All right.

07:15.751 --> 07:32.867
And now when I'm working for Calhoun in, over in the Teague Building, where were you officer?

07:33.427 --> 07:34.208
What year was that?

07:34.448 --> 07:35.389
This is under Williams.

07:36.787 --> 07:40.755
I was officeing on the ground floor of Rudder Tower, behind the elevators.

07:40.916 --> 07:41.697
Oh, yeah, that's right.

07:41.718 --> 07:44.143
The little office snuggled in behind there.

07:44.383 --> 07:49.133
Because Dr. Williams' office was in the now Jack Williams' building, the system building.

07:49.153 --> 07:50.336
Yes, yes.

07:50.356 --> 07:56.449
Okay, and all right, did, in your routine, did you have

07:56.817 --> 08:21.390
meetings were you part of the group that met with Williams no all right so that would have been Howard I sat in on a couple meetings in Howard's absence when maybe Howard would be on vacation or something but only once or twice did you have any impression of his style of dealing with committees no not really it's so vague that I just don't recall did you

08:21.657 --> 08:24.159
And did you ever get any direct calls from him?

08:24.440 --> 08:24.920
Never did.

08:25.500 --> 08:25.601
Okay.

08:25.621 --> 08:27.422
Never did, uh-huh.

08:27.442 --> 08:29.944
All right.

08:32.687 --> 08:50.483
With William's illness in 76, and then the board kicks him upstairs, Jarvis Miller becomes the president, and then he serves through 1980.

08:51.138 --> 08:59.373
Any memories you have of those years of how things were operating in the business area?

09:00.335 --> 09:07.628
No, not really because my contact primarily was with Howard Vestal and Tom Cherry and of course I'm sure they interfaced.

09:08.369 --> 09:09.872
I know that I took

09:10.628 --> 09:17.819
After Jarvis had been given the boot, before while he was still in the President's home, I took some papers over for him to sign one time.

09:17.859 --> 09:25.631
And I had just been promoted to Brigadier General at the time, and I was able to tell him about that, and he was very pleased over that.

09:26.873 --> 09:30.078
But that's, I've never had any contact with him.

09:30.619 --> 09:39.032
All right, now let's turn the corner on the, how were you able to keep going

09:39.788 --> 09:44.092
very, very demanding professional job and your reserve.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.054
Very carefully.

09:48.255 --> 09:54.260
We had, of course, we were authorized two weeks a year military leave and then whatever vacation time we had coming.

09:56.142 --> 10:01.086
I spent all of that time for years and years and years on active duty in the military.

10:01.326 --> 10:01.907
All of both?

10:02.307 --> 10:02.867
All of both.

10:03.348 --> 10:04.529
We didn't have a vacation.

10:05.249 --> 10:07.611
My kids grew up without knowing what a vacation was.

10:07.812 --> 10:09.593
So you spent about a month

10:09.826 --> 10:17.979
A month a year on active duty and then plus at least one and sometimes two weekends a month in addition to that.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.644
Where would those weeks normally be spent?

10:21.764 --> 10:24.589
I had on numerous assignments.

10:24.969 --> 10:32.661
My first one was at Ellington Air Force Base in Houston and then I moved to Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin and then to

10:33.890 --> 10:47.422
Denver, Colorado, the Lowry Air Force Base, and then Oklahoma City for a couple of years, and then to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, and then finally to Randolph Air Force Base where I finished my career.

10:48.223 --> 10:50.045
Did the Air Force come pick you up?

10:50.065 --> 10:59.453
Some of the time they did, and other times I would, if I was on orders for active duty, then I would get reimbursed by the government for my travel, air travel.

11:00.154 --> 11:03.357
Other times I'd have to pay for it out of my pocket.

11:03.843 --> 11:06.686
During the calendar year, when did this month usually fall?

11:06.846 --> 11:07.787
In the summer, usually.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.851
Usually in the summer, which is a slack time for us in auxiliary enterprises.

11:13.493 --> 11:17.477
When I was at Maxwell, it was when I was promoted to Major General, got my second star there.

11:18.117 --> 11:26.245
So then when I moved to Randolph as the assistant to the commander of Air Training Command, I already had my second star when I went down there.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.127
And that's as high as you can go in the reserve.

11:28.448 --> 11:30.930
Even the chief of the Air Force Reserve is only a two star.

11:31.467 --> 11:39.237
Any Aggie experiences in your reserve duty that you recall?

11:39.277 --> 11:47.066
I recall that I was known far and wide in the Air Force Reserve community as the Aggie, you know.

11:47.386 --> 11:47.667
Really?

11:47.947 --> 11:52.733
Not too many Aggies in the reserves at that level, you know.

11:52.915 --> 12:02.091
Now, there are a lot of people that are in flying units that love to fly, and if you know anything about pilots, they'd rather fly an airplane than be the president.

12:02.111 --> 12:05.197
I mean, it's almost an addiction with them.

12:05.938 --> 12:08.643
But I was never able to fly because my eyes were always so bad.

12:09.765 --> 12:17.539
I was always in the logistics support activities and what have you, and there are not too many Aggies that are in that

12:18.110 --> 12:21.274
activity, especially at, say, full kernel and above.

12:21.955 --> 12:23.337
So I was always known as the Aggie.

12:23.357 --> 12:24.138
There comes the Aggie.

12:24.699 --> 12:26.401
And I took a great deal of pride in that.

12:27.603 --> 12:28.925
All right.

12:29.406 --> 12:40.641
After Dr. Miller sent some interim for a year, were there any particular changes during his time in business affairs?

12:41.768 --> 12:42.569
Not really.

12:43.169 --> 12:45.732
It was a pretty steady organization.

12:45.952 --> 12:58.745
Of course, Howard being vice president and me being his associate, that's when I first got my introduction to the Board of Regents, was when I moved in as associate vice president for business fairs under Howard, and that was a two-year period.

12:58.765 --> 13:01.588
Was that during the interim time?

13:01.828 --> 13:05.452
Chuck Samson was there, and then later on Frank came in.

13:06.313 --> 13:09.396
Let's just briefly.

13:09.967 --> 13:11.649
Dr. Miller is terminated.

13:11.669 --> 13:19.379
I learned it the night I got to El Paso to begin service out there as UTEP president.

13:20.720 --> 13:26.848
Where, how did you hear the news of what had happened to him?

13:27.188 --> 13:28.310
It was a Wednesday night.

13:30.192 --> 13:30.833
I don't remember.

13:32.134 --> 13:34.337
The only thing I remember is that

13:34.520 --> 13:36.684
At that time I was attending all the board meetings.

13:37.085 --> 13:43.538
Howard always wanted me to go so I'd stay up to date on what was happening so that in his absence I'd be able to carry on.

13:44.680 --> 13:50.692
And I do remember that Ross Weisenbecker used to have some very derogatory remarks about Jarvis Miller.

13:50.712 --> 13:53.237
Called him Porky was his nickname because he was

13:53.437 --> 13:55.140
at that time was a little bit overweight.

13:55.381 --> 13:56.463
I don't know if he is now or not.

13:56.483 --> 13:57.966
I haven't seen Jarvis in a long time.

13:59.208 --> 14:08.105
But I thought at that time there's trouble a-brewin' because Weisenbaker at that time had a great deal of power on the board.

14:08.145 --> 14:11.091
He was the chairman of the building committee.

14:11.830 --> 14:15.776
I don't think that he ever wanted to be chairman of the board because he didn't want to take the demotion.

14:17.880 --> 14:26.053
But I felt at that time that there was a problem ahead for Jarvis because of Weisenbaker's obvious dislike for him, and I never knew why.

14:26.754 --> 14:36.330
Were you aware of any other board members that took sides for or against personalities at that particular time?

14:36.510 --> 14:37.011
Not really.

14:37.582 --> 14:39.744
When I started going, Bob Bright was chairman.

14:39.985 --> 14:45.711
And, of course, I would sit on the end of the hall, onto the end of the boardroom right opposite him.

14:45.791 --> 14:50.997
And I got to know all the board members on a personal basis and did the whole time I was there.

14:51.337 --> 14:54.781
I was associate for two years and then vice president for four and a half years.

14:54.801 --> 14:56.043
So I had six and a half years.

14:56.824 --> 14:59.346
And I never missed a board meeting during that time as far as I know.

14:59.366 --> 15:05.293
During those years, as far as you were aware, which board members were the most influential?

15:06.607 --> 15:08.155
I'm not gonna ask you to leave.

15:09.562 --> 15:13.260
Well, of course the chairman, whoever the chairman is, has to have a great deal of influence.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.828
And Bum was a very strong,

15:15.297 --> 15:17.739
a will person and a very strong person.

15:18.380 --> 15:21.964
David Eller, on the other hand, had a completely different style, but it was very effective.

15:22.024 --> 15:23.906
I thought a very effective chairman.

15:25.047 --> 15:28.931
I'd have to say Royce Weisenbecker would probably come very close.

15:29.171 --> 15:31.594
Billy Mac McKenzie was a very strong personality.

15:31.614 --> 15:33.656
He and Weisenbecker had some clashes.

15:36.298 --> 15:39.862
But I would say those are the ones that pop into my mind.

15:39.882 --> 15:41.524
A lot of just super nice.

15:41.704 --> 15:44.747
Joe Richardson was one of my favorites, just a super guy.

15:45.284 --> 15:55.299
Now, I've heard some people offer the opinion that Mr. Eisenbaker seemed to have a bias in favor of anything engineering.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.622
No question about it.

15:57.642 --> 16:00.787
And negative of anything agriculture.

16:02.530 --> 16:11.283
I can't speak to the negative on the agriculture side, but by process elimination, you could probably say, yes, that's a true statement.

16:11.303 --> 16:14.127
But there's no question that he was very...

16:14.765 --> 16:24.456
very partial to engineering, I think that Herb Richardson would have never surfaced to the level that he did without Royce's support, for example.

16:26.438 --> 16:37.110
When Chuck Sampson took over as interim president, were there any particular briefing sessions to orient him for the business affairs area?

16:38.660 --> 16:41.345
We gave him briefings, but I don't remember to what extent.

16:41.405 --> 16:44.851
They were not in-depth briefings at all, no.

16:45.192 --> 16:49.240
Were there any changes in routine for business affairs during his year?

16:51.143 --> 16:52.706
Not to my knowledge.

16:53.948 --> 16:57.134
Everything was going well, so we didn't make any changes.

16:58.737 --> 17:02.524
Are you aware of how you first heard that Frank Vander was going to be the new president?

17:04.563 --> 17:10.388
Howard's office was, of course we were all in the Koch building at that time,

17:10.739 --> 17:15.143
Howard's office was a mirror of the president's office only on the other side.

17:15.163 --> 17:17.266
Of course, you know where Mac Prescott's office was.

17:18.267 --> 17:25.354
And my office was, well, I was kind of nestled in, I've forgotten exactly where it was.

17:25.434 --> 17:26.996
It was nestled somewhere in between there.

17:28.337 --> 17:39.328
But I remember when they were interviewing people for the job that a tall gentleman came in and he looked so familiar that I couldn't place where I'd seen him before.

17:39.595 --> 17:48.848
And he came in to visit with Howard because it was customary at that time for all the vice presidents to talk to the prospects.

17:48.868 --> 17:53.174
And after he left, Howard came into my office and he had a grin on his face.

17:53.194 --> 17:56.359
He said, did you recognize that fellow that just left?

17:56.960 --> 18:00.805
I said, I did, but I cannot for the life of me picture who he was.

18:01.046 --> 18:03.409
He said, think of him with a uniform on me.

18:04.081 --> 18:05.424
And I said, that was Lou Allen.

18:05.724 --> 18:11.536
He was the chairman of, he was the chief of staff of the United States Air Force, four-star, and just retired.

18:12.438 --> 18:13.480
And I know he was interviewed.

18:13.540 --> 18:17.728
And I thought, you know, they're going to have to go some to beat that guy.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.013
Well, then Frank Vandiver was announced.

18:20.073 --> 18:21.335
I never heard of Frank Vandiver.

18:21.816 --> 18:24.682
Didn't know him until I saw him the first time.

18:25.704 --> 18:26.325
But...

18:26.913 --> 18:29.758
He was my dissertation advisor at Rice.

18:29.778 --> 18:30.539
Is that a fact?

18:33.464 --> 18:37.791
For the Rudder Memorial Service, he was the interim president at Rice at that point.

18:38.673 --> 18:41.437
And he asked me if I would take him to the service.

18:42.138 --> 18:43.581
He wanted to represent Rice.

18:43.941 --> 18:48.409
And he said, I don't know how far away the airport is from G.Y.I.

18:48.489 --> 18:50.632
I said, well, I can drive that car.

18:50.652 --> 18:52.836
We can make it in a half a day or so.

18:53.305 --> 18:58.430
And so I go back a long way with him.

18:59.031 --> 19:09.581
He called me the night before his appointment was announced and said, don't let it out until it is announced tomorrow.

19:10.142 --> 19:11.363
And he said, what do you think?

19:11.543 --> 19:18.430
And I said, Dr. Andrew, I can't think of anyone I've ever known who will have a harder time understanding Texas A&M than you will.

19:18.891 --> 19:19.712
He said, what do you mean?

19:20.132 --> 19:22.114
And I said, you are so brilliant intellectually.

19:22.786 --> 19:27.252
that you never had to go through all of the routine that us ordinary folks did.

19:27.272 --> 19:33.702
You didn't go to organized classes until you began your master's degree at age 15, I think it was.

19:33.722 --> 19:37.287
And I said, A&M is a very routine place.

19:37.547 --> 19:39.029
You go through the routine.

19:39.230 --> 19:40.291
Extremely conservative.

19:40.351 --> 19:41.413
Extremely conservative.

19:41.713 --> 19:47.882
And I said, I mean by that word, hesitant to change, whether for better or for worse.

19:48.470 --> 19:52.677
And I said, you're one who is willing to change anything, anytime.

19:54.199 --> 19:54.900
Very prophetic.

19:55.542 --> 20:01.992
Now, when he came, how did you all make him aware of A&M business affairs?

20:02.012 --> 20:07.120
Well, of course, as I say, Howard was still the vice president, and I was the associate vice president.

20:07.140 --> 20:08.723
But Howard included me.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.078
in almost everything he did.

20:11.098 --> 20:14.283
That was his style and I really appreciated that very much.

20:15.205 --> 20:35.757
But there were, as I recall, we took him on a tour of all the various business activities and he was very impressed with the size of the physical plant and the magnitude of the business operations and the millions and millions of dollars of monies that were handled in the business affairs area.

20:35.737 --> 20:45.446
But, no, it was a, as I recall, we had a whole week that we took him and introduced him to people and what have you.

20:45.466 --> 20:45.686
Okay.

20:47.187 --> 20:58.097
Then, is it during his administration that you, that things are divided and that there are two vice presidents?

20:58.898 --> 21:00.780
They were all together under Howard.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.123
When Howard retired is when they were divided.

21:04.255 --> 21:06.438
And who's president there?

21:06.458 --> 21:07.720
Frank Vandenberg is, yeah.

21:08.401 --> 21:25.145
And this, I would think that most people don't realize it, but Art Blair had a tremendous amount of influence over Frank as far as organizational structure and day-to-day operations were concerned.

21:25.725 --> 21:28.189
And for the purposes of this tape, just identify him.

21:28.710 --> 21:33.857
Art Blair was the, I believe his title was assistant to the president.

21:34.934 --> 21:43.665
One little bit of trivia that we cooked up, all the vice presidents were in line of chain of command to assume the presidency in the president's absence.

21:43.685 --> 21:53.978
Well, I think first was the vice president of academic affairs and then Eddie Joe and I think there were five of us all together.

21:54.439 --> 21:56.141
I think I was about fourth on the list.

21:56.642 --> 22:01.448
Well, one day for a two-day period, everyone was gone.

22:01.968 --> 22:04.491
So Art called up, and he says, guess what?

22:04.652 --> 22:06.454
He said, you're the acting president.

22:06.474 --> 22:07.776
I said, put it in writing.

22:08.437 --> 22:17.208
So he wrote a letter, and I have it framed hanging on the wall, designating me as the acting president of Texas A&M University for a two-day period.

22:17.849 --> 22:20.212
So it's nothing, but it's a bit of trivia.

22:20.833 --> 22:27.722
But Art Blair had a whole lot to do with this organizational structure, and they brought me into quite a bit of it before it was put in concrete.

22:27.837 --> 22:30.587
Now, was Art military in background?

22:30.767 --> 22:39.197
Retired military, he was a professor of English at West Point for many years, and at the Citadel before that.

22:39.717 --> 22:43.404
But he was career military, retired as a full colonel, Army full colonel.

22:44.326 --> 22:48.974
And he and Frank, I think, met at the Citadel, but I don't know in what capacity.

22:49.856 --> 22:55.085
But when Howard announced his retirement, Frank asked me to come in.

22:56.909 --> 23:01.337
That was along about the time I'd made my first star, and Frank was very,

23:02.144 --> 23:07.772
appreciative of that, very complimentary of the fact that he had a general on his staff.

23:07.792 --> 23:14.020
He brought me in, sat me down, shut the door, and he said, Chuck, I got something I want you to, a little job I want you to take on for me.

23:14.841 --> 23:16.944
I said, well, sure, sir, what can I do for you?

23:16.964 --> 23:20.308
Thought maybe he was going to be United Way Drive chairman or something.

23:20.609 --> 23:31.223
He said, well, we're considering the reorganization of the business affairs area, and we're going to create a new position called Vice President for Operations, and he said, I'd like you to take that position.

23:31.574 --> 23:41.624
Of course, he could have knocked me over the feather, because I had no idea that, first of all, there's going to be a reorganization, or that I would even be considered as Howard's replacement.

23:41.644 --> 23:53.136
And so, in any event... As far as you know, had that reorganization change been cleared with Chancellor Huber?

23:53.156 --> 23:54.218
I do not know.

23:55.058 --> 24:01.345
I do know that one of the things that Frank had almost insisted upon...

24:01.612 --> 24:06.719
was a free hand on doing whatever reorganization he felt was appropriate at the university level.

24:07.440 --> 24:16.673
So I feel, you know, out of courtesy, I'm sure that he ran it by Hubert, but I'm sure that he felt at that stage of the game that he had the decision-making authority to do that.

24:18.055 --> 24:27.287
And so then after that organizational structure was put into place, then, of course, then we needed the vice president for finance, and that's where Eddie Joe came in.

24:28.108 --> 24:29.190
All right.

24:29.210 --> 24:31.433
During those years as vice president,

24:31.970 --> 24:35.770
What were the major decisions that they all made?

24:37.268 --> 24:39.011
A lot of it had to do with construction.

24:39.231 --> 24:58.482
I almost lived with General Peel for a long period of time because there was so much construction going on during that period of time, all of which involved business affairs and operations and physical plant and the interaction between General Peel's operation and at that time Joe Estill's operation at the physical plant where they just almost lived together.

24:59.043 --> 25:00.686
Of course, Joe's working for General Peel now.

25:00.706 --> 25:02.128
I don't know if you knew that or not.

25:02.733 --> 25:09.402
Robert Smith fired him as director of the physical plant and he was probably one of the best physical plant directors in the entire United States at the time.

25:10.022 --> 25:12.706
President of their national association at the time he was fired.

25:13.867 --> 25:22.939
And that was a bad mistake in my opinion but of course I was retired and I'm not going to second judge somebody else's judgment.

25:22.959 --> 25:25.382
But in any event, General Peel

25:25.767 --> 25:51.066
hired joe and he has him in a very responsible position now and so but i forgot what the question was well the major decisions oh yes other than construction i'd say just day-to-day operation of all the activities and they were varied well you know we had so many activities going and all of them growing like topsy do you remember any decision major minor which

25:51.383 --> 25:55.869
You now say, gee, if I had known then what I now know, we would have done it differently?

26:00.234 --> 26:00.935
No, not really.

26:01.596 --> 26:09.545
I think that the decisions we made were appropriate for the time, and I don't know of anything that we did that was too sharp.

26:09.605 --> 26:10.847
Parking was always a problem.

26:10.887 --> 26:14.151
I felt we should have probably accelerated our parking garage program.

26:15.177 --> 26:20.522
If you'd known then what you know now, would you put the parking structures in the same places?

26:20.542 --> 26:21.103
I think so.

26:21.123 --> 26:21.984
I would have made them bigger.

26:22.645 --> 26:26.108
I would have made them larger than they are now, especially the one behind Rudder Tower.

26:28.551 --> 26:31.253
Why can't that one be expanded to the south?

26:31.273 --> 26:31.814
It could be.

26:32.515 --> 26:38.521
That property is almost wasted property in there and it's prime location.

26:38.721 --> 26:39.381
It's prime.

26:40.963 --> 26:44.847
You can build another structure the size of that one behind it and

26:45.535 --> 27:15.070
and it would not there's a little draw in there but that's no that's no engineering problem and uh in terms of appearance it would not be could just look like an extension of that but if you consider the the parking garage behind the coldest building the parking garage over on university drive and the parking garage on the west campus that's the only place visitors have to park now if you wanted to go to the library for example someone

27:15.370 --> 27:18.195
of my age or older, you can't get there from here.

27:18.355 --> 27:18.715
That's right.

27:18.735 --> 27:25.887
You know, you're prohibited from going on the campus because it's too far to walk and you can't park close enough for a reasonable.

27:26.968 --> 27:35.542
My office is on the sixth floor of the Evans Library and two or three people have said, well, let me come to your office.

27:35.562 --> 27:36.864
And I tell them, no, it'd be simple.

27:36.884 --> 27:37.345
Forget it.

27:37.595 --> 27:37.895
Yeah.

27:37.915 --> 27:39.077
I need to meet you somewhere else.

27:39.097 --> 27:40.880
And I don't know a solution to that now.

27:40.900 --> 27:41.621
No, not now.

27:41.961 --> 27:42.682
We're landlocked.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.304
Okay.

27:44.925 --> 28:06.775
Can you remember any, was there any, in any of your years, whether as vice president or were there any attempts that you can share by some former student, some legislator, some outsider to try to influence something like that?

28:08.392 --> 28:09.393
Only in two areas.

28:10.795 --> 28:18.446
Trying to get somebody a dormitory room or trying to get somebody football tickets.

28:18.466 --> 28:25.555
Neither of which I could influence because we had responsibility for the dormitories but not what happened in the dormitories.

28:25.595 --> 28:26.997
That was all under John Coldest.

28:27.217 --> 28:29.360
The housing office was always under John.

28:30.181 --> 28:33.486
No calls to you about parking tickets?

28:34.327 --> 28:35.749
Yes, I had a few of those.

28:36.134 --> 28:36.715
A few of those.

28:36.775 --> 28:41.763
From anybody of any supposed potent position?

28:41.923 --> 28:44.106
No, no.

28:44.487 --> 28:51.938
Bob always took the stance that if you're going to have a policy, you've got to enforce it across the board.

28:52.619 --> 28:54.843
He even towed Vandiver's car one day.

28:55.103 --> 29:00.772
He was illegally parked and he knew it was Vandiver's car, but he was illegally parked and he towed it.

29:01.393 --> 29:03.576
Made him pay 50 bucks to get it out of the compound.

29:04.045 --> 29:06.328
Oh, now you remind me of one I want to put on this tape.

29:07.230 --> 29:13.058
The anecdote way back about that black man that was kind of Mr. Rudder's errand runner.

29:13.979 --> 29:15.061
I can't remember his name.

29:15.722 --> 29:16.803
No, I don't know.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.786
It was a very mature man.

29:20.609 --> 29:25.797
And he got stopped on the campus by a campus policeman for speeding.

29:25.937 --> 29:28.661
Because he was really scared.

29:28.681 --> 29:33.167
And as I understood the story, he told the campus policeman, you can't give me a ticket.

29:33.187 --> 29:33.748
Why can't?

29:34.420 --> 29:37.347
Well, I work for President Rutter, and I'm his number one man.

29:38.450 --> 29:41.959
And as I understand, the campus policeman said, I work for Mr. Rutter, too.

29:42.019 --> 29:47.653
And I think he would want me to give you a ticket because you've been speeding too much.

29:48.292 --> 30:18.231
uh and later i understood that when mr under heard about that he said that's right give him the ticket yeah um all right so then vandiver and now you serve under what other presidents he's the only one he's all right so he's the last one right i went in as vice president fairly soon after he got there and he was there as i recall seven and a half years and i was there four and a half so he was the only president i ever worked for as vice president in building construction or any other

30:18.920 --> 30:23.648
were there ever any system bureaucracy interferences that were frustrating?

30:25.792 --> 30:26.954
Not from the system, no.

30:27.655 --> 30:35.690
There was one positive deal that I thought was an interesting story having to do with the extension of runway 1634 at Easterwood.

30:36.591 --> 30:39.797
It was a 5,500 foot long runway.

30:40.435 --> 30:43.839
And we made the proposal that we need to extend it.

30:44.200 --> 30:47.885
FAA came in and studied the situation.

30:47.925 --> 30:59.760
They were going to fund some aviation dollars, and we had some money from our auxiliary enterprise we were going to put in, and we were going to make it a 7,500-foot runway.

31:00.972 --> 31:02.094
Got to the building committee.

31:02.174 --> 31:05.140
We had it all proposed and all funded and ready to go.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.526
And Mr. Weisenbecker said, no, so that's not going to work.

31:09.728 --> 31:12.573
He said, we need a 10,000 foot runway.

31:13.996 --> 31:17.282
And we all said, yes, sir, we know we need that, but we can't afford it.

31:17.683 --> 31:19.727
He says, you're not listening.

31:20.227 --> 31:23.233
We need a 10,000 foot runway.
