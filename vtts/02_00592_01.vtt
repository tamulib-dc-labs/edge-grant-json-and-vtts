00:28.229 --> 00:34.917
The answer to your question is both yes and no. And 
the first thing is the ambassadors did not attend

00:36.618 --> 00:42.065
the bond group. This is a technical matter, but in 
answer to your question.

00:48.472 --> 00:54.979
The people who actually attended the bond group 
were people at the level of a political counselor.

01:06.974 --> 01:26.018
And

01:06.974 --> 01:26.018
it's very difficult to be precise because when you 
go to meetings over a long period of time, there are

01:06.974 --> 01:26.018
sort of ebbs and flows of events. Some days there's 
one approach and another day another approach or

01:27.399 --> 01:34.348
even on specific items. the attitude of the 
various governments

01:35.003 --> 01:40.511
might change. Whether the French were becoming 
more friendly with the Russians than the British,

01:41.052 --> 01:50.646
it's kind of hard to say. I wouldn't try to answer it 
that way. In the preparation, in actual work,

01:54.051 --> 02:01.061
things are not all that clear. And even for the 
governments, more a case of

02:04.653 --> 02:16.491
broad policies or broad efforts, you'll decide 
that it's time to try to negotiate. And all of this

02:17.213 --> 02:28.450
was taking place against a background where an 
effort was being made to decide whether or not we

02:17.213 --> 02:28.450
could

02:35.112 --> 03:03.972
with the Russians or that the notion of they talk 
had just started and we thought that the best way to

02:35.112 --> 03:03.972
bring that into reality was to see what it really 
meant to the Russians and our thesis was well let's

02:35.112 --> 03:03.972
test it out on Berlin Berlin is a good test case or 
the most important case if they want they talk so

02:35.112 --> 03:03.972
let's see if we can negotiate there so that 
everybody was following this thesis It wasn't

03:04.947 --> 03:06.068
just the French. And I would not recall, I don't 
think that just spelling the Soviet spy had any

03:08.070 --> 03:21.484
effect on the British. I think we were all 
following the same line, which was what people now

03:21.584 --> 03:29.292
call their tongue. Your second question? About 
Egon Barth.

03:42.460 --> 03:46.648
back to the question of Shade's attitude. I think 
some people felt that Barr was perhaps a little bit

03:47.430 --> 04:00.094
farther to the left than the people he was dealing 
with. And in a case like that,

04:12.835 --> 04:33.634
of internal

04:12.835 --> 04:33.634
subjective evaluations of people and events that 
mean that in dealing with Barr, you would be rather

04:12.835 --> 04:33.634
skeptical, hesitant, and so forth. He was the 
political advisor, you might say, or the

04:34.095 --> 04:41.762
intellectual advisor.

04:46.703 --> 05:16.103
so I wouldn't say that the reservations took the 
form of lack of trust although there was this

04:46.703 --> 05:16.103
speculation about Barr that he was a little

04:46.703 --> 05:16.103
a little too far to the left to be you know totally 
relied on but this is just a question of judgment do

04:46.703 --> 05:16.103
you trust somebody's judgment and you may his 
judgment more or less without it being a case of

05:17.399 --> 05:23.129
trust of the individual.

05:25.995 --> 05:27.097
Is that clear, Adam? Mm-hmm. Are you saying, um, I 
brought him up under early negotiating

05:30.062 --> 05:37.095
with the, uh,

05:54.524 --> 06:06.756
I don't

05:54.524 --> 06:06.756
remember to tell you the truth. I can't remember 
what the... It may have been. I would guess

06:13.082 --> 06:16.706
probably it's along this line. I think it was a 
step. We were trying to demonstrate good faith.

06:35.513 --> 06:46.466
this was something that we came up with as a 
demonstration of goodwill, of good faith, of

06:35.513 --> 06:46.466
being ready to get on with it, and so forth. And I 
can't remember... I think that for some reason the

06:48.388 --> 06:59.221
Soviets must have wanted this to take place, and we 
agreed to do this as a concession. But I can't

06:59.241 --> 07:01.683
remember now the details. I think it was in that 
category of... of demonstrating good faith and

07:05.922 --> 07:13.977
demonstrating that we are serious in our intent at 
this meeting to show our good faith. We have today

07:14.017 --> 07:19.447
decided to blah, blah, blah, whatever it is.

07:19.467 --> 07:25.197
Well, that's good, because why did these Germans 
do that then?

07:38.339 --> 07:43.024
It could have been, again, I don't remember that 
occurring. See, part of the problem is that time

07:43.524 --> 07:59.861
passes, and unless you continue to review the 
material why these items get away from you, I would

07:43.524 --> 07:59.861
guess that that's probably what it was. Unless 
something else had happened, the way that they

08:00.061 --> 08:08.329
demonstrated the fact that they had us around the 
throat was by doing these things, increasing the

08:09.322 --> 08:14.674
tolls and so forth. It seems like it would have been 
a bad time for them to do it. They should have been

08:21.310 --> 08:24.377
showing some signs

08:55.559 --> 09:07.116
No,

08:55.559 --> 09:07.116
I wouldn't describe anything that occurred 
during that time as a sellout. I'm going to take the

09:08.799 --> 09:16.470
right wing of the journalist term.

09:26.677 --> 09:39.344
of the chancellor

09:26.677 --> 09:39.344
as his political advisor and also as a negotiator 
in a sense. Frequently, you will find a president

09:40.546 --> 09:44.635
or a chancellor, someone

10:12.796 --> 10:14.278
giving up a lot here. What he was doing was 
indicating that at this point, Bonn, the federal

10:14.599 --> 10:37.335
public, was ready and willing to negotiate an 
agreement which would recognize and establish

10:14.599 --> 10:37.335
some legitimacy to the government in East 
Germany.

10:49.482 --> 11:04.859
Yeah, I didn't understand

10:49.482 --> 11:04.859
that,

10:49.482 --> 11:04.859
signed by the Russians.

11:06.501 --> 11:11.327
Again,

11:06.501 --> 11:11.327
I don't remember that incident.

11:14.911 --> 11:15.552
What did they say? Do you remember what the front 
letter said? What did they say? What did they do?

11:23.995 --> 11:25.057
They didn't say. They just said that, you know, I 
was just wondering mainly why, how you could

11:26.119 --> 11:35.416
negotiate something and then not ever have to sign 
it. The reason is that

11:59.783 --> 12:17.228
If you only were willing to operate on the basis of 
agreeing to something on the basis of a written

11:59.783 --> 12:17.228
piece of paper, you would be very restricted in 
what you could accomplish. So at a certain point,

12:17.248 --> 12:26.061
politicians have to decide whether they're 
willing to accept something less than a written

12:17.248 --> 12:26.061
piece of paper

12:41.043 --> 12:45.674
is the deal you've got acceptable to the other 
side? Are they willing to tolerate it and abide by

12:45.694 --> 12:48.601
it? And if so, why, presumably, the deal will work. 
So it would have been something that

13:22.758 --> 13:31.196
and how the Russians felt about it, they probably 
said okay or just shook their head or said, well, we

13:22.758 --> 13:31.196
won't send it back to you or so forth. But they 
indicated they would accept that approach. So

13:34.703 --> 13:39.012
this is just a technique which they used in that 
circumstance.

14:05.722 --> 14:14.861
written down, translated very carefully, and all 
the texts gone over carefully, and all the work.

14:15.623 --> 14:24.321
But this may have been one of those cases where in a 
preliminary negotiation, he felt this was

14:15.623 --> 14:24.321
desirable.

14:35.759 --> 14:38.002
They were essential. They were basic. They were 
it. As I said before,

14:41.508 --> 14:50.181
the notion was, can there be such a thing as 
Daytona? And we, at that time, felt we should move

14:52.104 --> 14:58.633
in the direction of Daytona. Brant had taken the 
lead, and we were responsive to it. in Europe has

15:04.531 --> 15:07.005
rocked on for too many years. We've not had any 
breakthrough. We haven't had any development.

15:50.937 --> 16:04.178
Again, I just have to tell you, frankly, that I 
don't remember the state of play in where the

15:50.937 --> 16:04.178
European Security Conference... Was that the one 
that met in Geneva? I

16:04.699 --> 16:11.369
think, again, I can't quite remember. I did not go 
to that thing. And I think I did write a few items

16:14.174 --> 16:18.801
that were... used there. I'm sure I wrote some 
speeches or wrote some

16:54.944 --> 17:04.481
that any particular conference was important in 
influencing their decision to reach a

16:54.944 --> 17:04.481
settlement. Because that act in and of itself, the 
settlement, was important to them. It was very

17:09.630 --> 17:18.606
clear, very understandable, and they didn't need 
to go to a European security conference to

17:09.630 --> 17:18.606
influence their decision.

17:33.740 --> 17:43.586
Yeah, I think they were doing a music security 
conference on what they called the Russian heat

17:33.740 --> 17:43.586
movement. They were trying to pick up a different, 
you know, that...

18:01.482 --> 18:13.343
They're playing that same card right now, all 
these demonstrations in Europe, to the extent

18:01.482 --> 18:13.343
that they have Soviet encouragement or support. 
The assumption is that a lot of people who

18:13.363 --> 18:16.268
participate in these

18:40.683 --> 18:47.410
of the people, some of the encouragement and so 
forth, does have Soviet encouragement at least.

18:48.552 --> 19:02.447
So, but even so, I don't think that that's a major, I 
don't think the Soviets think that's going to

18:48.552 --> 19:02.447
determine the course of our affairs immediately 
or not. I don't think so.

19:29.047 --> 19:32.432
It seems it would no longer serve as an obstacle.

19:37.940 --> 19:55.105
Well, again,

19:37.940 --> 19:55.105
how important it was is very hard to say, because 
you're asking for a quantification, which

19:37.940 --> 19:55.105
frequently is not possible. At that stage, all 
other signs were negative, and this was suddenly a

19:55.810 --> 20:01.061
positive one. You might say it was very important. 
Usually, it's a case of building up. Things don't

20:08.998 --> 20:12.546
usually happen that there's a direct turnaround. 
So we probably would have been getting

20:12.566 --> 20:15.793
indications.

20:31.788 --> 20:46.149
this meeting could have been just, you know, 
another encounter where, among other subjects,

20:31.788 --> 20:46.149
they discussed this and they confirmed, yeah, we 
think it's time to try to get together and so forth.

20:46.169 --> 20:49.955
Usually the conversations are in rather general 
terms. They don't try to avoid getting very

20:49.995 --> 20:56.644
specific at the presidential level. So I would 
say...

21:03.175 --> 21:18.032
A little bit like the comment on the European 
Security Conference, part of the developments of

21:03.175 --> 21:18.032
the time, but not anything that turned the tide, in 
effect.

21:23.918 --> 21:31.967
You say, what effect did a sniper attack at the 
Soviet Memorial have on the negotiations when

21:23.918 --> 21:31.967
they resumed?

21:50.965 --> 21:58.613
Did it disturb you that the West Germans did not 
initially link the Bonn-Warsaw Treaty with any

21:50.965 --> 21:58.613
Berlin settlement? I don't remember. The answer 
is probably not. The reason would have been that I

22:04.580 --> 22:15.792
would guess before they did it, there would have 
been certain consultations that they would have

22:04.580 --> 22:15.792
told the three British, French, and Irish.

22:21.053 --> 22:28.303
If they didn't do it, I would guess there would have 
been consultation, some sort of thing they should

22:21.053 --> 22:28.303
have consulted about. If for any reason they 
didn't do it, they had some explanation which was

22:29.084 --> 22:36.996
considered acceptable. And we have not tried 
to...

22:52.407 --> 22:53.744
They're grown men. They know what the facts of life 
are.

23:28.064 --> 23:39.101
Yeah, they were saying in the book that somebody 
was upset in the State Department because they

23:28.064 --> 23:39.101
were just negotiating without more power. Yeah, 
that gets a little dicey because the problem there

23:40.223 --> 23:56.248
could be if they, for their own reasons, made some 
arrangement or entered into an agreement,

23:59.519 --> 24:23.468
We are the power that is ultimately responsible in 
West Berlin, and we would have wanted to be sure

23:59.519 --> 24:23.468
that any discussions or any actions taken would 
have been consistent with all sorts of things of

23:59.519 --> 24:23.468
importance to us, not compromise our legal 
position,

24:29.371 --> 24:36.890
not make us appear to be something that we didn't 
want to appear to be. And so forth. So we certainly

24:38.514 --> 24:46.654
would not, I think, have wanted to just turn them 
loose without them.
