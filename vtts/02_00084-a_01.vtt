00:03.929 --> 00:21.297
This is May 7, a beautiful day in Kerrville, Texas, 
and sitting in the living room looking out on the

00:03.929 --> 00:21.297
golf course with Mr. Porter Garner, Jr. And I 
should have held this mic up near where I am. Mr.

00:21.357 --> 00:24.562
Garner, say a sentence and let's check yours. Yes, 
is it coming through all right?

00:32.178 --> 00:41.712
Let's begin with a brief review of where you were 
born and grew up and went to high school before you

00:32.178 --> 00:41.712
thought about going to A&M. All right. I was born in 
Carnes County, a little community out between

00:42.954 --> 00:53.130
Carnes City and Nixon called Mound Creek. My 
father was a schoolteacher. He had a two teacher

00:59.633 --> 01:04.238
school at that time at Mound Creek. And

01:04.258 --> 01:14.448
we moved when I was a babe in arms to Rivera, Texas, 
down below Kingsville. It was quite a promotion

01:15.830 --> 01:17.992
for my father. He got about a seven teacher school 
where he was superintendent there. After

01:22.697 --> 01:27.582
two or three years there, they built the college in 
Kingsville, which at that time was called South

01:27.967 --> 01:34.914
Texas State Teachers College. And my father was 
the first male student to enroll when they built

01:35.915 --> 01:41.621
that college. And because prior to this time, all 
he had was a teacher's certificate, which he had

01:42.522 --> 01:55.155
gained in one semester at, it was not called 
Southwest, texas state then it was i believe it was

01:55.253 --> 02:24.872
southwest texas normal in san marcos in san marcos 
he attended there one semester and passed the

01:55.253 --> 02:24.872
requirements for a teacher certificate anyway he 
decided if he was going to stay in the profession he

01:55.253 --> 02:24.872
better get him a formal education i know this is 
kind of running a no no way but anyway he did he

01:55.253 --> 02:24.872
finished there in Kingsville. He was the night 
watchman, janitor, did some tutoring on the side

02:25.994 --> 02:47.819
and raised a family and finished there in three and 
a half years and went from there to the little town

02:25.994 --> 02:47.819
of Premont as superintendent. From there to Corn 
City, Corn City to Robstown, and Robstown to

02:55.295 --> 03:04.870
Victoria and that's where he retired from 
teaching and we moved to Laredo where he went into

02:55.295 --> 03:04.870
private business.

03:08.515 --> 03:23.698
Robstown was dear to me for quite a few reasons but 
that's where my father first became involved in

03:08.515 --> 03:23.698
any way with Lyndon Johnson and that was strictly 
because of the Kleberg in Kingsville room Lyndon

03:25.400 --> 03:55.407
Johnson worked for Bob Kleberg back at that time as 
I believe it was called an administrative

03:25.400 --> 03:55.407
assistant and it stood well for my father later on 
because of being able to get things for the schools

03:25.400 --> 03:55.407
to the National Youth Administration and which 
Johnson was, I would, hold on just a moment.

04:05.628 --> 04:08.472
Anyway, back to the deal. He got a lot of programs 
for the different schools where he was located

04:10.534 --> 04:25.512
through the National Youth Administration to 
create jobs for kids that were going to school and

04:10.534 --> 04:25.512
had a little problem because we're talking about 
the, depression years, and everybody was anxious

04:25.812 --> 04:34.500
for all the help they could get. I'll say that I was 
quite young at that time, but I do remember a lot of

04:36.422 --> 04:55.380
things that at the time didn't necessarily make 
sense to me, but as I look back I could understand

04:55.917 --> 04:56.719
what took place. One little thing in, in Robstown, 
for instance, one of the first schools to ever have

04:56.779 --> 05:05.996
a, in South Texas, to have a cafeteria on site. And 
all of us in the elementary grades were forced to

05:07.359 --> 05:14.353
have lunch at the cafeteria. And

05:19.627 --> 05:26.898
And the reason for it was to ensure that all 
children got a hot meal, one hot meal a day, good

05:19.627 --> 05:26.898
meal. And you didn't pay at the cafeteria. Your 
homeroom teacher took up the money because she

05:31.385 --> 05:39.517
knew who could afford that nickel or dime and who 
couldn't. And no one ever knew who paid and who

05:40.179 --> 05:43.664
didn't pay. But anyway, that's neither here nor 
there. It's just a little background.

05:48.770 --> 05:49.611
information. My father, who was my ideal, he was

05:49.691 --> 06:04.051
my ideal. That's the best thing I can say. Anyway, 
when I finished high school in Laredo, Texas,

06:16.006 --> 06:19.670
Exactly why I went to Texas A&M, I can't tell you. Do 
you know when you first thought about it?

06:26.116 --> 06:29.580
Probably in 1939 and 40. And it wasn't because of 
the football team, even though I'm a great

06:29.900 --> 06:34.505
football fan. We had some boys from Laredo who had 
been friends of mine but were a year ahead of me in

06:36.126 --> 06:44.815
school. and a couple of them that I knew quite well 
had gone to A&M as freshmen and come home and

06:45.352 --> 07:02.715
the things they would talk about and so on just 
impressed me so that I thought this ought to be a

06:45.352 --> 07:02.715
pretty good deal. Do you remember what it was that 
they said attracted you? the camaraderie of the

07:08.352 --> 07:17.083
cohesiveness of the students and just so many 
things like that. It certainly wasn't the

07:18.024 --> 07:24.732
academics because I was like a lot of young kids at 
that time.

07:27.555 --> 07:29.938
I didn't know what in the world I wanted to do. My 
daddy had talked about how being a doctor would be

07:32.872 --> 07:35.255
such a nice thing. I thought, well, that would be a 
nice thing to be as a doctor. I'll just think about

07:38.579 --> 07:40.742
that. Well, these boys, I don't know, if they would 
have told me everything about being a freshman at

07:42.084 --> 07:52.136
A&M, I might not have gone. But anyway, it was the 
camaraderie and everything that just, It was just

07:59.500 --> 08:02.944
the thing to do as far as I was concerned. Did you go 
visit before you went to enroll? The first time I

08:06.348 --> 08:21.466
ever saw Texas A&M was when my father helped me 
unload my footlocker out of the back of the car over

08:06.348 --> 08:21.466
in what was called at that time the new area. Now I 
think they call it the quad or something. He helped

08:26.551 --> 08:29.715
me, set it on the ground there. We shook hands, and 
he said, son, you're on your own. And he drove off.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.950
And it was a rude awakening. It was different. 
Describe those first few hours and days. Well,

08:46.796 --> 08:54.145
when I first looked, I knew, found out that that was 
dorm... I mean, dorm four, and that's where I was,

08:54.985 --> 09:03.833
no, let's see, dorm six, and that's where I was 
supposed to be. I said, well, I can't handle all

09:03.853 --> 09:10.780
this I've got here. So I saw a fella going over 
towards that door and I said, hey, I said, and

09:10.840 --> 09:22.090
fortunately I did introduce myself to him. And I 
asked him if he'd help me take that trunk I was

09:23.032 --> 09:27.596
supposed to be there. And so he said, sure. And so he 
picked up one end of the trunk, and I had the trunk

09:30.279 --> 09:34.362
and a suitcase. And he helped me carry it in. And it 
so happened that I had a corner room assigned to me

09:37.485 --> 09:43.571
on the second floor. And he went right along with me 
and helped me put that trunk down in that corner

09:43.651 --> 09:51.418
room. I started to unpack and put things around and 
so on and so forth and all of a sudden a couple of

09:52.748 --> 10:09.312
fellas came in and asked me what I was doing and I 
said well I was just unpacking and he says why here?

10:09.372 --> 10:14.520
And well to make a long story short I was it was 
explained to me that I was not going to be in that

10:14.956 --> 10:32.141
room, that there had been a mistake in some way, and 
it would be better for the time being if I just put my

10:14.956 --> 10:32.141
things out in the hall and I would be told later 
where to put them. Well, that was just, that was my

10:33.163 --> 10:41.655
first awakening at being a freshman at Texas A&M 
University. So happened that different ones were

10:43.795 --> 11:10.579
drifting in and a lot of them in my same shape and it 
didn't take very long however for us to understand

10:43.795 --> 11:10.579
that just take it easy and don't let the mouth get to 
working too much and see what happens.

11:11.588 --> 11:34.862
Well one thing led to another and we were assigned 
to different, to roommates and to different rooms

11:11.588 --> 11:34.862
and in fact the first night we were there I was 
initiated in what they called a bleed meeting and

11:36.496 --> 11:38.499
I'm sure you're familiar with it. Describe yours. 
Well, this first one was all the freshmen that were

11:39.761 --> 11:50.095
there at the time, and I would say there was, had to 
be at least 20 of us. We were in a room, all sitting on

11:51.998 --> 11:56.565
the floor.

11:59.589 --> 12:05.878
Sardines had never been packed any tighter than 
that.

12:06.719 --> 12:19.112
That room is approximately 10

12:06.719 --> 12:19.112
or 12 by 14. I would, and that's given a little bit. 
It certainly wasn't any bigger than that. And

12:27.020 --> 12:35.308
there was a double deck bed in there, a dresser,

12:40.435 --> 12:52.852
two desks, it wasn't a dresser either, there was a 
medicine cabinet and a sink, and two tables for

12:40.435 --> 12:52.852
desks, two chairs. This

12:53.934 --> 13:10.257
doesn't sound like it's possible, but on top of 
that, there was at least 20 freshmen on the floor,

12:53.934 --> 13:10.257
sitting on the beds and on the tables, for this were 
sophomores, or pissheads. And I

13:18.317 --> 13:25.126
learned real quick, don't look down, look up. Even 
if, whatever, you look right at one of them, don't

13:25.326 --> 13:31.634
let your eyes stray away. And we were given to 
understand real quick that

13:42.620 --> 14:12.508
I believe the saying went, a freshman

13:42.620 --> 14:12.508
was lower than,

13:42.620 --> 14:12.508
if you'll just pardon the vernacular because 
you're going to edit this out, says if a freshman,

13:42.620 --> 14:12.508
sir,

13:42.620 --> 14:12.508
is the lowest thing imaginable, it's ten times 
lower than whales shed on the bottom of the ocean.

14:14.227 --> 14:19.854
yet it's 100 times higher than a graduate of Texas 
University. And there were a few other little

14:21.396 --> 14:31.908
things, but it always ended up with, that, sir, is 
the definition of a freshman. Well,

14:31.928 --> 14:43.542
it was quickly to be understood that we were there 
for the, at the pleasure and for the pleasure of the

14:44.011 --> 14:53.685
upperclassmen, and what happened to us was 
strictly immaterial, supposedly. It was a full

14:55.808 --> 15:12.972
year or more before I learned that these people 
really and truly cared for us, and that with

14:55.808 --> 15:12.972
possibly one or two exceptions, they all turned 
out to be great great fellas what was your outfit i

15:13.458 --> 15:41.068
was in i battery field artillery did it have a 
nickname no no it didn't prior the year prior or two

15:13.458 --> 15:41.068
years prior it had been called third combat train 
but they we had to look at our time had the largest

15:13.458 --> 15:41.068
freshman class that had ever come to texas a m we 
had, if I'm not mistaken, around

15:41.555 --> 15:51.114
1,600 or something in our freshman class. Now that 
might miss it a little, but that's pretty close.

15:57.130 --> 16:00.333
you didn't make any choice as to field artillery. 
It was selected for you? No, no. We had a, we could

16:02.636 --> 16:07.681
put down choices. You didn't necessarily get what 
you put down, but if your application got in early

16:08.221 --> 16:16.770
enough, you probably got what you put down. And the 
reason I put field artillery down was the friends

16:16.830 --> 16:25.078
of mine from Laredo had said that's probably the 
best thing. How do I know? Now, as you were making

16:27.030 --> 16:40.687
that choice, did it ever occur to you that the 
events that were occurring in Europe might have,

16:27.030 --> 16:40.687
wartime events, might have an impact on you? Let me 
tell you something about that.

16:47.556 --> 16:50.880
And this is going to be hard for you to believe, but 
it's the truth. The majority of students coming in

16:55.822 --> 17:11.485
to Texas A&M at that time were

16:55.822 --> 17:11.485
really unconcerned.

17:13.869 --> 17:18.395
Not, didn't, sure we knew that there was problems 
over there. We knew that Poland had been invaded.

17:22.421 --> 17:23.483
We knew that France had been invaded. But

17:26.080 --> 17:47.985
it's very difficult for today's people to,

17:26.080 --> 17:47.985
with our instant, instant knowledge and 
communication of everything all over, to realize

17:26.080 --> 17:47.985
back at that time how something that was taking 
place in Europe, which was a century away, how it

17:48.590 --> 17:58.080
really affected us. And sure, we knew that it was 
going on and so on and so forth, but weren't really

17:59.421 --> 18:07.810
that concerned. It was not really truly, truly 
brought home to us, even though they had started

18:07.870 --> 18:16.639
with the peacetime draft. But it was not truly 
brought home to us until Pearl Harbor happened.

18:25.060 --> 18:34.613
Describe how you as a freshman got your uniforms 
and how you and your roommates settled down in your

18:25.060 --> 18:34.613
room and so forth. Well,

18:35.374 --> 18:47.470
my roommate was a young man named James Collins 
from Gonzales, Texas. Jimmy left after, oh, I

18:49.542 --> 18:56.149
don't think he even stayed till midterm.

18:59.073 --> 18:59.633
Let's see. I guess he did. He stayed until midterm 
and went home and never came back after midterm.

19:10.205 --> 19:16.933
And he joined the Air Force and was killed very 
shortly first went overseas and was killed almost

19:17.588 --> 19:21.854
immediately. But anyway, we got our issue, all 
being naturally an ROTC, we got two, let's see, two

19:23.496 --> 19:46.347
pair of wool pants, two pair of khaki pants, I 
believe two khaki shirts, And as

19:46.934 --> 19:55.165
I remember it, that's about the size of the issue. 
Now, were shoes part of the issue? No, no. You had to

19:58.029 --> 19:58.830
buy your shoes. You had to buy your shoes. And they 
were what? Black? Oh, no, they were brown. Brown,

20:06.781 --> 20:07.282
okay. You had to buy a brown shoe, yes, sir. And? 
Hat, you bought your hat. I came to school with my

20:12.095 --> 20:15.258
hat. I bought my hat in Laredo. And let's see. In 
fact, I think that that was about the only issue

20:22.926 --> 20:33.936
that we had, even though we only wore khakis and 
uniform. I mean, there was no such thing,

20:33.996 --> 20:37.680
especially for a freshman, to not wear anything 
but the uniform. Did the clothes fit your uniform?

20:45.831 --> 20:46.572
Pretty closely. I was of about a normal size, I 
would say, at that time, and I didn't have a lot of

20:47.674 --> 20:55.283
problems that way. Clothes fit pretty well. But, 
you know, as well as they're going to fit. But

21:03.472 --> 21:07.397
anyway, we didn't have too much problem there. And

21:08.069 --> 21:15.239
things went along pretty normal. It was one thing 
to learn about being set on details and all of this

21:15.899 --> 21:21.948
stuff. And the fact was that your life just wasn't 
your own, that's all. But they were very, very

21:28.657 --> 21:36.507
protective when it came to school

21:37.583 --> 22:07.168
from seven o'clock in the evening until eleven 
o'clock or no no eleven o'clock that's right

21:37.583 --> 22:07.168
eleven o'clock until the grades came out you had to 
be sitting at your desk whether you were studying

21:37.583 --> 22:07.168
or what you had to be sitting there and if you're 
going to be sitting there you might as well be

21:37.583 --> 22:07.168
studying or reading something after the grades 
came out big concession. If you were passing, had

22:10.107 --> 22:19.682
17 hours and 17 grade points, you could go to bed at 
10 o'clock. So that was a big concession.

22:24.665 --> 22:32.933
That was your, in the Aggie lingo, then your fish 
old lady left fairly soon. Right. Were you then

22:33.654 --> 22:35.115
without a roommate? No, no, no, no, no. There was 
quite a few left. But a lot of them left when the

22:39.259 --> 22:43.123
grades came out. And there was no problem in 
filling up the space there. So I got... In fact,

22:53.268 --> 23:08.726
during my time at A&M, I had, before I went into the 
service, which we were there a long time after we

22:53.268 --> 23:08.726
went in the service, before I went in the service, I 
had three different roommates. And

23:08.746 --> 23:22.161
the one left at midterm, the next one left at the end 
of the long term, And then we had a, we went over to

23:23.322 --> 23:39.220
three semesters a year,

23:23.322 --> 23:39.220
starting in September of 42,

23:23.322 --> 23:39.220
I guess it was. Not September, May, around May of 
42. And that boy left then and went into the Navy.

23:53.242 --> 23:54.303
Then we went in.

23:57.628 --> 23:59.350
We were inducted, let's say. No, we weren't 
inducted until early

23:59.571 --> 24:04.858
43. Officially, we were inducted December of 
1942. We had joined what was called the Enlisted

24:12.468 --> 24:17.815
Reserve Corps. They came to A&M with different 
propositions. The Navy had a V-12 program. And, of

24:27.422 --> 24:31.888
course, we always asked, how long can we stay in 
school? Can't promise you a thing, boys, but we'd

24:33.370 --> 24:39.018
like to have you in our program. The Marines came 
with a program called, I don't know, V-something

24:40.540 --> 24:47.970
else. and how long can we stay in school? I said, I 
can't promise you a thing. The Army came with the

24:55.700 --> 25:00.225
Enlisted Reserve Corps. How long can we stay in 
school? As long as you keep your grades up. Where do

25:06.432 --> 25:07.253
we sign? As far as I know, the Navy boys and the 
Marines might still be down there at College

25:09.275 --> 25:18.345
Station, but they pulled us out. they didn't 
adhere to their promise that they made, which I can

25:18.545 --> 25:26.095
understand those things. And we were pulled out 
and sent to different places to be inducted. I

25:40.414 --> 25:47.083
happened to be sent to Louisiana to... Polk?

25:48.228 --> 25:48.709
Livingston? Livingston, Camp Livingston. 
Actually, it was Camp Beauregard, which was just a

25:51.012 --> 25:59.425
few miles from Livingston, and they inducted us 
there. They took us over to Livingston to do

26:00.526 --> 26:07.917
everything, but we were actually sleeping at Camp 
Beauregard. Let's go back to this freshman year,

26:08.498 --> 26:10.501
first of all. Did you have a major? Yes. a major in 
zoology and with a minor in chemistry. I was taking

26:20.549 --> 26:22.311
a pre-medical. Do you remember what courses you 
had that first fall? I guess. I had English,

26:27.617 --> 26:40.813
Algebra, Biology, Chemistry,

26:27.617 --> 26:40.813
English, English, algebra, math. Math, history. 
The what? Math or history. I had algebra. Oh,

26:49.888 --> 26:50.368
algebra. Okay. You mentioned it. And let's see. I 
had one other.

27:01.523 --> 27:02.285
Oh, and German. German. I was thinking German. And 
physical education. Do you remember some of those

27:05.309 --> 27:06.751
teachers? Yes. Describe them, please. All right. 
I had a... biology teacher that I can't call his

27:14.172 --> 27:24.528
name, but he was a wonderful, wonderful teacher. I 
had an algebra teacher that was horrible. I say

27:35.333 --> 27:40.522
that without any rancor towards him. The story was 
that he had always taught advanced calculus, but

27:41.924 --> 28:00.615
with the terrific influx of students, he was 
pressed into service to teach freshman algebra.

28:02.857 --> 28:07.001
I question not his abilities as a mathematician. 
He was brilliant. But to teach a bunch of us

28:10.525 --> 28:18.914
freshman algebra, it was something else. I hadn't 
had enough in high school to begin with. And his

28:23.699 --> 28:30.366
name was Halperin, Dutch Halperin. Somebody made 
the mistake of saying Dr. Halperin. He was not Dr.

28:33.777 --> 28:35.601
Halperin. He would let you know that. He had a lot of 
little idiosyncrasies. He could draw a line

28:42.033 --> 28:49.388
across that board like that that you couldn't draw 
with a straightedge. But up and down, it was

28:50.229 --> 28:53.215
like...

28:55.068 --> 29:03.076
He,

28:55.068 --> 29:03.076
you know, tells us very often, he says, you are 
dumb. You are so dumb. He says, you should be in

29:05.979 --> 29:10.103
kindergarten. Now, the Dutch came from his 
Germanic right. And he would, he'd say, you know,

29:14.107 --> 29:20.313
he says, you ought to be like me. Well, I'm getting 
ahead of myself, but there was a boy in our class

29:23.873 --> 29:24.734
named Dean. His last name was Dean. He was from 
Austin, Texas. Pretty smart boy, but he was having

29:29.518 --> 29:33.302
a hard time as a freshman. He was in the cavalry, and 
he was in, I believe, C Troop, and they were

29:33.322 --> 29:42.070
notorious for the way the freshmen were treated. 
And Dean was having trouble staying awake in

29:43.411 --> 29:52.159
class, and he had been to sleep several times in 
Halpert's class, Finally Halperin one day just

29:52.730 --> 30:02.786
started reading a riot act to him and told him 
about, says, says, Dean said, you are so dumb. And

30:02.906 --> 30:05.831
he says, you should be like me. He says, I speak six 
different languages. Dean said, and if you could

30:09.397 --> 30:14.445
speak English, you'd make seven. Well, Halperin 
would just fall about that big. Dean got up. He was

30:20.041 --> 30:21.202
smart. He got up, got his books, and walked right 
out of the class. But he went right straight to Dean

30:25.827 --> 30:30.591
Brooks' office. Dean Brooks was a fine man.

30:34.896 --> 30:43.304
Got in to see Dean Brooks, told him the whole story 
of what happened, and told him, and he convinced

30:34.896 --> 30:43.304
him. He said, Dean Brooks says, I'm not as dumb as 
this fellow thinks. and says, if you will take a

30:48.012 --> 30:57.601
chance on me and assign me to another section, he 
says, I'll show you what I can do. And Dean Brooks

30:58.261 --> 31:03.626
did, and Dean did, and Dean turned out to be a very 
good student. That's just one little thing that

31:03.666 --> 31:07.189
happened. Let's see, what about the other 
classes? I had a... Chemistry? Chemistry was a

31:13.855 --> 31:15.977
lecture. And then the one that was in charge of our 
section, well, we had a lab.
