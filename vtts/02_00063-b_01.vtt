00:02.444 --> 00:25.600
out with a diagram that the support material for 
the course would be made up of several different

00:02.444 --> 00:25.600
disciplines and if they had two out of the six that 
was usually adequate and that they shouldn't be

00:02.444 --> 00:25.600
shouldn't have difficulty catching up on the 
others but that if they had more than two out of the

00:02.444 --> 00:25.600
six they would probably find it much easier. 
Describe the course and its makeup. You taught it

00:32.644 --> 00:35.067
how many times per year? This course is taught 
every fall semester. And about how many normally

00:38.592 --> 00:41.777
in their first years? How many students? The 
student numbers, usually 10 or 12. It was usually

00:49.147 --> 00:53.713
larger than some of our other graduate courses. 
But it changed through the years because each of

00:53.693 --> 01:09.475
these areas are influenced by economic factors 
and when the geologists were getting more jobs,

00:53.693 --> 01:09.475
well the students went out in the field and that 
type of factor entered in. It's a course that

01:12.019 --> 01:23.515
combines crystallography and mineralogy and 
chemistry and physics looking at the at the solid

01:24.119 --> 01:27.244
materials of soils. And that means everything 
from glass out of a volcano to the oldest, rustiest

01:27.625 --> 01:40.287
soils you can think of in the most highly weathered 
landscapes in the world. Compare the course

01:40.868 --> 01:46.398
content then, 30 years ago, and now. How has it 
changed? It's changed mostly in exactness. We

01:53.691 --> 01:58.399
used to make generalizations where the data were 
inadequate. We would say in early textbooks you

01:58.439 --> 02:05.652
would find people writing about amorphous iron 
oxides Well, amorphous iron oxides were really

02:05.783 --> 02:19.944
not amorphous, most always, but we didn't have 
electron microscopes that were good enough to

02:05.783 --> 02:19.944
identify those very tiny crystals with very small 
spacings. And so today, that word amorphous has

02:20.725 --> 02:25.632
gotten smaller and smaller through the through 
the decades. And in general, we've gotten much

02:27.542 --> 02:31.185
more exact. We can deal with bonding somewhat, 
chemical bonding with infrared more than we used

02:31.245 --> 02:36.651
to. And the data set has expanded so much. Some of 
the basics, of course, Roentgen invented,

02:44.819 --> 02:51.045
discovered x-rays about 100 years ago. And that 
put clay mineralogy in, which is much of soil

02:51.582 --> 02:56.475
mineralogy. And so we've had x-ray machines. I use 
an x-ray machine that's 30 years old. So in a sense,

03:03.132 --> 03:07.583
but with the computers and with the visuals, Many 
of them now, of course, we do in color and do

03:07.985 --> 03:12.836
electronically and all that. Those are 
technological advances. Did this course, when

03:16.744 --> 03:23.800
you started it here, did it meet once a week, three 
times a week, seminar, lecture, or what? Through

03:25.433 --> 03:36.024
the years, it's a heavy laboratory course because 
we teach several different instrumental

03:25.433 --> 03:36.024
methods, chemical methods, and physical 
methods. So the students work very hard in the lab.

03:42.131 --> 03:48.878
And usually we, starting in the early days, we had 
three lectures a week and we had two laboratory

03:42.131 --> 03:48.878
sessions. Later in the term, we might narrow it 
down to one laboratory session. But they spent a

03:55.100 --> 04:03.375
lot of extra hours in the laboratory just because 
we couldn't figure out any way to do the job more

03:55.100 --> 04:03.375
efficiently. A couple of years ago, or more than 
that, some years ago, five years or so ago, I

04:04.817 --> 04:12.311
decided we're now on the west campus. Many of these 
students come back and forth to the building. And I

04:15.856 --> 04:23.545
thought it would be better if we get those students 
in and teach them all in two afternoons a week. And

04:23.565 --> 04:24.887
that's the way we do it now. We teach them a lecture, 
have a long lecture, then we have a break, and then

04:25.467 --> 04:33.937
we have a laboratory from two to five. And that is 
better for the students and for the faculty. So I

04:40.866 --> 04:42.808
like that. Of course, we don't just use 
instruments in our laboratories. We also use

04:45.812 --> 04:48.976
instruments in the electron mic laboratory. 
Compare the facilities in the old state chemist

04:49.837 --> 04:53.542
building. Did you all go straight over west of the 
track? Compare that and that. Well, it's a lot of

04:59.070 --> 05:01.593
overlap. The centrifuges that we bought years 
before I came even, we're still using some of

05:01.613 --> 05:06.940
those. And the x-ray machine that Kunze bought, 
I'm still using it. But we computerized that, oh,

05:10.910 --> 05:16.006
15 years ago or something. And now, instead of 
having... strip charts and such. We have, all of

05:22.494 --> 05:33.658
our data comes out on a disk and we move it around 
electronically and plot it as we want to

05:22.494 --> 05:33.658
electronically. In other words, we get a lot more 
out of the instrument because the computer can run

05:38.088 --> 05:44.966
the instrument for us and help us to get the data in a 
manageable form. And that's been a tremendous

05:44.987 --> 05:47.353
asset. We saved $100,000 on the instrument simply 
by buying a computer and some data. processing

05:52.735 --> 06:18.034
equipment that's made in a research laboratory in 
california by a small firm out there and and and now

05:52.735 --> 06:18.034
when we were working for example with the rice land 
poorly crystalline materials we just set the

05:52.735 --> 06:18.034
computer up to run that instrument for 10 hours if 
that's what it needed and and this is random

05:52.735 --> 06:18.034
particle statistics that we use in case of x-rays, 
and therefore if we can integrate over 10 hours

06:18.014 --> 06:34.337
data sort of step by step, then our statistics are 
much better and we can get definitive data on

06:18.014 --> 06:34.337
things that we had never even found before. Does 
each student have the same research task plus a

06:36.460 --> 06:43.870
special project? Like in history, they'd do a term 
paper and it'd be a different term paper for each

06:44.761 --> 06:49.947
youngster. What would be their laboratory 
research project? In our case, each student is

06:54.893 --> 07:13.115
encouraged and they very, very consistently 
follow through, bring a sample from their thesis

06:54.893 --> 07:13.115
or dissertation research and we take it apart. If 
it's a rock, they grind it up and we pursue it if it's

07:15.423 --> 07:33.921
a soil clay that's wet or dry well we we deal with 
that or any soil uh of course most all of our

07:15.423 --> 07:33.921
procedures are directed toward soils because 
that's that's the main thrust of the course And so

07:33.901 --> 07:46.605
they, this is a wonderful course, I think, and I 
think the students do too, in spite of the fact they

07:33.901 --> 07:46.605
work so long, they never really complain about the 
lab.

07:49.390 --> 07:53.918
We take the soil apart, physically and 
chemically. and then we analyze these

07:53.898 --> 07:56.401
components. And then we put those data back 
together again, and they interpret those data in

07:56.801 --> 08:15.461
terms of if it's from two miles deep in an oil well, 
or if it's from the surface soil in a rice paddy, or

07:56.801 --> 08:15.461
it's from anywhere, any type of sample. And if it's 
a treated material they're making for roadbed,

08:16.042 --> 08:20.547
that sort of thing. So the students work on their 
own material, and I've served on many committees

08:20.527 --> 08:35.648
in geology and civil engineering, and the only 
mineralogy data that many of those students had in

08:20.527 --> 08:35.648
their thesis was what they got in our class. Now, 
what we do now, and we've done in the last months,

08:35.668 --> 08:44.761
like from oceanography, they have a lot of fine 
equipment, but they don't have what we have. So

08:45.181 --> 08:47.985
they send their student over, Bill Bryant, for 
example, And we had this young lady from Italy who

08:48.607 --> 08:52.754
is a student of his. She spent like two or three 
months taking the soils, the sediments from the

08:53.314 --> 09:04.472
Gulf apart and then X-raying them and so on and 
making the analyses. And then that basis, she was

09:04.520 --> 09:09.687
writing her dissertation. So that's one of the 
beauties of it. It's an interactive course that

09:12.411 --> 09:17.517
goes on for quite some time, often. But back to this 
comparing, in terms of the laboratory equipment

09:23.926 --> 09:28.912
and space per student in the old and new buildings. 
How did those compare? We have a very adequate

09:31.135 --> 09:34.980
laboratory space. Now we have shrunk through the 
years. There was a time when we kept these students

09:37.423 --> 09:44.412
in the course separate from our own research 
laboratories. We can't afford that luxury

09:44.752 --> 09:46.495
anymore. So we now teach them in our research 
laboratories and we teach them also to respect

09:51.382 --> 09:55.770
what's going on otherwise in the laboratory. And 
this has worked out very well. We fabricate a

09:59.136 --> 10:08.513
significant amount of our equipment and modify 
quite a lot of our equipment so we don't have showy

09:59.136 --> 10:08.513
laboratories. but they're very functional. We 
use a magnet to separate the iron minerals from the

10:10.397 --> 10:14.865
other minerals. This was a cast off from chemistry 
that I traded an old spectrometer for that I

10:15.286 --> 10:24.342
couldn't use anymore. And yet this magnet has 
served us very well. That's the kind of things we

10:28.490 --> 10:30.754
sometimes do. Now, when you got here, did you feel 
that the students you had here, that their

10:30.734 --> 10:40.238
capability was as good as what you had known at the 
other two schools, or better, or what?

10:43.426 --> 10:48.118
I think the first student I had had a little problem 
in that we were sort of emerging from one type of

10:50.090 --> 10:59.042
research to more modern research. And he 
struggled quite a bit. And of course, he was

11:00.784 --> 11:04.149
changing from one advisor to another. That didn't 
make it any easier. But he ended up finishing here,

11:06.152 --> 11:13.722
doing a post-doctoral in Louisiana, and then 
going back and being a leader in India. And I even

11:14.283 --> 11:15.725
visited him there. So he... Against odds, he was 
not the most brilliant and effective student we

11:18.119 --> 11:24.306
ever had. But he had a lot of thrust, and it all 
turned out very well. But in general, those

11:29.231 --> 11:32.755
students that were in your course? We had good 
students. We've had good students throughout.

11:37.641 --> 11:40.044
This is a complex mix, as I've said. Not only of 
professions, but ethnically it's complex. I

11:44.288 --> 11:47.552
presume you had fewer international students 30 
years ago. Definitely so, yeah. Were most of the

11:49.876 --> 11:51.158
American? No, and there weren't any girls in those 
first days either. But now my course is probably a

11:54.682 --> 11:59.928
third girls, young ladies. Do you remember any 
events that had anything to do with the first girls

11:59.988 --> 12:07.697
in the courses? Were there any awkward moments or 
amusing moments? How did the other students

12:10.600 --> 12:14.544
relate to the young ladies? I think at times we 
rather soft-pedaled around the young ladies

12:15.165 --> 12:24.995
because we weren't quite sure how that was going to 
work out. But there's so many surprises in

12:25.015 --> 12:28.800
students. We had a case a few years ago when we had a 
little Chinese girl, didn't say very much, and

12:28.820 --> 12:40.472
very attentive. And then later when she was 
writing, we realized that she was a perfectionist

12:41.633 --> 12:49.530
in English. And she had actually grown up in New 
York. And then we would talk to her freely and it was

12:54.762 --> 13:00.655
a revelation, you know. She was really a very 
exceptional student. And then we've had some

13:04.578 --> 13:18.627
others who just got here and they really struggled 
because the English wasn't... One thing that I

13:04.578 --> 13:18.627
learned, the English taught in Taiwan is 
unfortunately not very good. The only student

13:22.776 --> 13:48.698
that I had from Taiwan who had excellent English 
served in their military, as an officer in the

13:22.776 --> 13:48.698
military, and he had had a lot of exposure of 
English, and that was Tsai Chin, who got his

13:22.776 --> 13:48.698
master's here, his doctor's here, both under my 
advice, and now he is an executive in the

13:22.776 --> 13:48.698
environmental branch of the industry in Taiwan. 
He started with humble beginnings with no

13:48.678 --> 13:58.492
support, but he eventually, and he's been back 
here to visit us from time to time. In general, I'm

13:58.512 --> 14:07.264
not going to ask the negative, in general, the best 
international students come from what country

13:58.512 --> 14:07.264
and or areas of the world? The best that you've had.

14:14.210 --> 14:20.396
Pretty hard question to answer in view of the 
diversity of them. The student I have right now

14:22.337 --> 14:28.063
from China, mainland China, is one of the best I've 
ever had. And partly because he developed his

14:29.023 --> 14:35.890
English very well, and he had his sights. I have 
corresponded with him for seven years, and he's

14:35.910 --> 14:39.553
been here four years. So he prepared himself for 
this. And the Taiwanese student who did well, he

14:43.420 --> 14:50.370
came from zero. It's very slow to emerge, but in the 
end was quite good. So,

14:56.238 --> 15:05.371
you know, we don't have a very good sampling of 
students from Germany and Britain. And so it's, I

15:06.873 --> 15:10.778
would say, the Chinese students would be one of the 
better groups. Now, in the department as a whole,

15:16.406 --> 15:26.364
we've had people from more other disciplines and 
different other countries, Scandinavia and so

15:16.406 --> 15:26.364
on. But

15:28.668 --> 15:36.141
it's a complex subject and And I try to examine 
students in such a way that I cut across what they

15:36.948 --> 15:43.880
learn. And therefore, by the end of the term, I have 
a whole page of data on what their performance is.

15:53.456 --> 15:58.104
And they don't spread out as much as it would be in 
some other grading systems. And therefore, Well,

16:01.349 --> 16:09.699
I've had some excellent students from the USA that 
certainly did better than others, but they had

16:01.349 --> 16:09.699
more going for them, I think. What has been your 
philosophy about grading? Did you grade on a

16:12.882 --> 16:14.564
curve, or? I grade on a curve, and I grade, and 
students have taught me something about grading,

16:14.584 --> 16:20.591
too. I didn't used to give much of the grade for lab, 
because it's so hard to grade laboratory. But one

16:26.698 --> 16:29.061
of the students, pointed that out to me once, so I 
then changed it. I developed a more formal,

16:34.000 --> 16:45.780
structured grading system and a lab manual, put it 
in there along with all the other course

16:34.000 --> 16:45.780
materials.

16:47.943 --> 16:50.768
I grade on the curve. I grade a small percentage for 
daily work. mainly just to stimulate their

16:57.560 --> 17:01.562
activity. usually have three major exams and then 
two grades in the laboratory at least. One would be

17:09.189 --> 17:10.770
their final report. They submit reports on 
certain of the instruments and the work they did

17:10.830 --> 17:28.849
with them, but their final report is really kind of 
a mini research paper on their sample and what they

17:10.830 --> 17:28.849
learned about it and what they learned from the 
scientific literature about it. and how that

17:29.673 --> 17:30.855
applies. You said you had 10, 12 normally in the 
course. Does grading on the curve imply only a

17:36.143 --> 17:43.455
certain number are going to get an A and a certain 
number are going to flunk? No. It's such a diverse

17:44.676 --> 17:48.222
population.

17:50.024 --> 17:57.077
I normally gave As and Bs and maybe one C 
occasionally. That's pretty much the grade. And

17:59.342 --> 18:09.320
if I had graded them just on the written exams, for 
example, well, I would have probably had a wider

17:59.342 --> 18:09.320
distribution. But when you put together the 
recitation on an exam along with a laboratory

18:13.447 --> 18:17.433
report. Some people do a much, the engineers write 
great reports because they're trained to do that.

18:24.764 --> 18:33.417
And so those things tend to balance out so the 
students get closer together as the course gets on

18:24.764 --> 18:33.417
further. And let's face it, that's a basic course 
for their thesis research and I was really mostly

18:39.856 --> 18:43.702
concerned that they'd be able to do the work 
properly. If I thought that they could not

18:44.424 --> 18:53.879
interpret an X-ray diffraction pattern and tell 
what the crystal phases were that were there, then

18:44.424 --> 18:53.879
they wouldn't get a B in the course, or an A, 
certainly. In fact, do you work the students

18:55.121 --> 19:02.674
harder now than you did 30 years ago? Does the 
course require more effort? We try not to do that

19:06.415 --> 19:11.101
because it is a heavy course.

19:13.524 --> 19:18.150
I think what we do is we give them more service and 
they go further. That's the way I see it. And I have a

19:19.712 --> 19:22.736
research associate who works with me in the 
course. And with the advent of the computer and all

19:22.796 --> 19:28.003
the efficiencies that that brings, We go much 
further with more methods, and they're better

19:28.473 --> 19:35.627
trained than they used to be. Now, in recent years, 
these two days where the course meets and the

19:36.048 --> 19:41.258
inaudibles are, what day? Tuesday, Thursday. 
Tuesday and Thursday. And it's from what hour to

19:45.065 --> 19:46.788
what hour? The lecture is 12. Let's see, 1245 to, 
when I'm doing it, I get used to it, but it's odd.

19:57.914 --> 20:08.484
It's a 75-minute lecture, overlaps part of the 
noon hour, and then we have a 15-minute break, as I

19:57.914 --> 20:08.484
remember, and then I believe it's at 2 o'clock when 
we start the lab. And it goes till? Till 5, 10,

20:09.745 --> 20:13.328
according to the clock. In a normal day, what time 
would you leave after lab, though? Or you're here

20:17.912 --> 20:19.253
till about what? Well, I would be here till five, 
and usually a little later, but my lab is mostly

20:19.604 --> 20:30.895
taught by my research associate, and he would 
definitely be here. And in what setting do you do

20:33.137 --> 20:36.661
the lecture? Is it in a seminar room around a table, 
or? I like the open forum room. Actually, the room I

20:44.989 --> 20:47.451
use is a room that my colleague Tom Hallmark uses to 
teach soil morphology. I chose it because we have

20:52.002 --> 20:57.972
these tables, and the students can sit close. I use 
a lot of models and a lot of visuals, so the surface

20:58.133 --> 21:06.527
is all bare, and I don't have a lectern sitting in 
front of me. I use an overhead projector some. And

21:09.773 --> 21:30.803
along the walls, they have soil profiles from 
Texas and Hawaii and some other states and special

21:09.773 --> 21:30.803
soil maps, the periodic table of the elements, and 
some maps to show different soil regions, the

21:09.773 --> 21:30.803
taxonomy of the soils, which This being a graduate 
course, we use quite a bit of soil science, but we

21:31.373 --> 21:37.346
don't have all soil science students. So 
therefore, I have to have some visuals that they

21:37.827 --> 21:48.049
can just pick up all by looking up on the ceiling 
there.

21:48.215 --> 21:54.225
And there are specimens lying around in there that 
occasionally I use in addition to the ones that I

21:48.215 --> 21:54.225
take in. There's

21:54.947 --> 22:01.558
a little indoctrination there, I guess you could 
say. The taxonomy of soils is kind of like the

22:01.578 --> 22:05.124
taxonomy of plants. It's familiar to people who 
use it, but not very familiar to the public. And

22:11.502 --> 22:16.589
then soil taxonomy is based on analytical data to a 
very significant extent. So to keep from

22:17.010 --> 22:25.041
burdening the student with more taxonomy than 
they want, I use that display of soils. Otherwise,

22:25.622 --> 22:30.068
when I said you notice the color of the iron oxides 
in this soil, they wouldn't have a visual image at

22:30.470 --> 22:32.732
all. And these profiles are one meter high or so. 
Now almost every student in there is there very

22:37.077 --> 22:44.705
much by their choice because of their thesis or 
dissertation. Did the course, the official title

22:45.366 --> 22:50.311
is of the course? I think it's just called Soil 
Mineralogy. Does it have a nickname? Do the

22:56.978 --> 22:59.160
students, have they come up with anything? 
Probably they have some that I haven't ever heard

22:59.967 --> 23:04.755
about. It's called clay mineralogy or soil 
mineralogy, depending on who you ask. And it's a

23:09.963 --> 23:16.373
heavily instrumented course. I don't know if 
they've ever coined an expression for it or not. Do

23:21.281 --> 23:25.468
you remember any kinds of pranks or jokes? in the 
lab or anything they've ever done for fun?

23:33.987 --> 23:34.828
They're pretty busy. They probably have, but I

23:35.148 --> 23:43.059
don't really recall any of them. What about 
something going wrong? Oh, well, as they go in the

23:45.122 --> 23:54.274
room the first day, we have a big centrifuge cover. 
with much of the paint scoured off of it. And a note

24:00.679 --> 24:03.222
under, this is an object lesson. You always check 
the cover on the centrifuge before you turn it on,

24:04.223 --> 24:15.374
because someone failed to do that once, and that 
cost us a lot. And centrifuges are, you know,

24:15.874 --> 24:24.683
they're kind of the workhorse of this lab, and 
they're really not serious threats to anyone, but

24:24.663 --> 24:29.428
they have tremendous power. And they're like 
these automobile tires that have fallen apart. At

24:33.953 --> 24:38.618
the speeds they run, they're dangerous if not used 
correctly. And so we spend a little time on that,

24:38.638 --> 24:45.826
and we've used centrifuges with just a few minor 
cases like that. We occasionally have an

24:45.946 --> 24:48.529
accident, but not very often. What other 
cautionary advice do you give the class?

24:52.777 --> 24:53.398
Chemicals. We deal with hydrogen peroxide, which 
is much more concentrated than bleach for the

24:53.758 --> 24:59.304
hair. And we deal with some solvents 
occasionally. Through the years, we have put

25:05.411 --> 25:10.697
aside most of the toxic things that we used to use. 
We don't use benzene anymore. We used to use

25:13.240 --> 25:15.582
benzene, think much about it. We used to use 
alcohol and acetone quite a lot. We've largely put

25:19.526 --> 25:21.889
those aside. Substituted

25:21.937 --> 25:26.842
other things. Let's see.

25:31.346 --> 25:39.795
Was there a significant early graduate student, 
one that you particular, in your earliest years,

25:31.346 --> 25:39.795
you now look back on with great pride?

25:42.457 --> 25:45.500
Oh yes, yes. I would say, More than one. Well, 
describe some of those. One of those students. I

25:53.994 --> 26:03.944
had a professor from Colorado State University 
who wanted to come down for, as I recall, one term.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.926
He was still on the faculty there. He came and spent 
his term, and he was not so special. But then he went

26:15.920 --> 26:22.410
back home and he sent me a graduate student of his 
named Doug Ming. M-I-N-G? Ming. M-I-N-G. It's not

26:25.455 --> 26:26.897
oriental. It's probably a shortening of the 
German, I imagine. And Doug had been a soils

26:31.544 --> 26:41.179
consultant on summers and he had been an athlete in 
Colorado State as well as a soils student. Gotten

26:41.540 --> 26:43.142
his master's degree with his gentleman who had 
been here briefly. And we had a, he was a kind of

26:47.460 --> 26:57.734
student that you didn't have to give much 
instruction to, we just kind of discussed things

26:47.460 --> 26:57.734
on an even level. And from time to time out on the 
atrium we would stop and talk in the morning about

26:58.675 --> 27:05.224
what he might work on. He was taking a lot of 
courses. And finally, we concluded that he ought

27:07.607 --> 27:11.492
to work on zeolites. And the reasons that we had was 
that nobody really knew anything about zeolites

27:12.569 --> 27:22.118
in soils, because they don't occur in many soils. 
And they are being sold to the ranchers and farmers

27:22.999 --> 27:27.984
down in the valley. And we knew that there were some 
in those soils from the geology information that

27:28.605 --> 27:34.490
was available. Well, in the end, Doug, as he went 
on, once he got motivated, well, he did several

27:43.332 --> 28:06.876
things uh he did his literature review as we start 
things and i was doing the second of our three books

27:43.332 --> 28:06.876
and i said well doug would you like to do that as a as a 
chapter in the book and you could get publication

27:43.332 --> 28:06.876
of your of your review and so he liked that idea so i 
asked colleague from New York who is a zeolite

28:07.379 --> 28:13.542
professional in a geologist sense. to team with 
him, and they wrote that. And as he got further

28:18.382 --> 28:23.970
along, he began to say, well, nobody uses zeolites 
much in soils. I don't know whether I'm going to be

28:24.531 --> 28:27.275
able to get a job or not. And it was the kind of time 
when jobs weren't so abundant. And then one day, he

28:31.020 --> 28:43.478
got a call from this geologist, Mumpton, and said, 
would you like to come and give a paper on your

28:31.020 --> 28:43.478
dissertation? to an international meeting. He's 
going to meet in one of the Eastern Bloc countries.

28:50.200 --> 28:59.593
And Doug said, well, I'd like to do that, but I'm 
writing my dissertation, and I don't have any

28:50.200 --> 28:59.593
money to go over there. And so they just kept upping 
the ante. And finally they said, all right, we'll

29:03.758 --> 29:06.962
pay you away. You're the only person we've been 
able to find who can address zeolites in soils with

29:07.002 --> 29:12.790
the experience base that you have. He had gone down 
in southwest Texas and studied them in the field,

29:13.327 --> 29:19.575
and we had gone down there and sampled and so on. So 
he'd gotten quite a bit of experience. So he went

29:22.880 --> 29:28.067
and gave a paper, which was published, and along 
with several others. And then he got a

29:29.088 --> 29:36.638
postdoctoral, yes, with NASA. And then after a 
while, well, he just stayed and stayed. And they

29:41.980 --> 29:44.367
made a position for him. He's now a space 
scientist. And they developed two systems to

29:46.433 --> 29:52.731
support man for long journeys in space. And one of 
them is called Zeoponics. And that grew out of Doug

29:56.003 --> 29:59.829
Ming's dissertation. Of course, it's come a long 
way, but that's what got him started. And I

30:03.976 --> 30:06.460
remember distinctly him coming one night. I was 
working in the Electron Night Center alone, and he

30:06.540 --> 30:20.664
came in and said, Dr. Dixon, I'm thinking about 
dropping out of school and going back and

30:06.540 --> 30:20.664
consulting like I used to this summer. What do you 
think about that?

30:26.075 --> 30:37.713
I said, well, Doug, you see what I'm doing and when 
I'm doing it, so that's all the way I feel about you.

30:38.073 --> 30:41.218
If you give this your best, you'll get a job. We 
don't know where it's going to be, but you'll get a

30:41.378 --> 30:43.922
job. And so he never asked that question anymore. 
And now he's He organizes sessions and national

30:50.712 --> 31:01.467
scientific meetings, and he travels all over the 
country speaking for NASA, promoting their

30:50.712 --> 31:01.467
programs, and he has a research program there.

31:04.311 --> 31:06.134
Done exceptionally well. So you're obviously 
proud of him. Others you want to mention?
