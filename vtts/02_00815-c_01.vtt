WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:25.650
After the pledges for Speaker were pretty well 
secured for Mr. Clayton, and everyone was

00:01.938 --> 00:25.650
resigned to the fact that he would be elected 
Speaker in January of 1975 when the legislature

00:01.938 --> 00:25.650
convened, I was in the Capitol,

00:01.938 --> 00:25.650
two people that

00:28.094 --> 00:45.010
associated with education stopped me to 
congratulate me on the fact that I was going to be

00:28.094 --> 00:45.010
appointed chairman of the Education Committee 
when the legislature convened and the Speaker

00:28.094 --> 00:45.010
made his appointments. I had served on the 
Education Committee in the previous session and

00:46.452 --> 00:57.983
then served on the Education Committee during the 
Constitutional Convention. the second person

00:59.077 --> 01:17.585
had told me this, I immediately proceeded to Mr. 
Clayton's office and spoke

00:59.077 --> 01:17.585
to him for the first time since

00:59.077 --> 01:17.585
day blitz. I told him of the rumor that I had heard in 
the Capitol, and I wanted him to understand that I

01:26.161 --> 01:31.848
would rather serve on the Appropriations 
Committee than be chairman of the Education

01:26.161 --> 01:31.848
Committee. Of course, I did not get a commitment 
from Speaker-elect Clayton at that time and did

01:33.289 --> 01:41.319
not expect to. Shortly thereafter, I run into one 
of his early supporters. In our discussions, He

01:51.878 --> 02:02.011
indicated to me that he had an interest in 
education and would like to serve on that

01:51.878 --> 02:02.011
committee or to chair the committee. I asked him if 
he had shared that with Mr. Clayton, and he said no,

02:02.031 --> 02:08.119
they had not talked about it. I suggested to him 
that he should do that and do it very soon. That was a

02:15.328 --> 02:18.612
turning point or not, I do not know.

02:20.735 --> 02:24.500
and was appointed Chairman of the Education 
Committee. After our meetings I began to think

02:26.643 --> 02:39.340
about my appointments and I thought maybe I will be 
appointed as Vice Chairman of the House

02:26.643 --> 02:39.340
Appropriations Committee since I was an early 
supporter. Never occurred to me that I might have a

02:40.701 --> 02:47.991
shot at being Chairman of the House 
Appropriations Committee. I did not to say any

02:49.810 --> 02:59.465
more to the speaker about it and leave it in his 
hands as to what the appointment might be. That

03:01.949 --> 03:09.861
committee appointments were being discussed in 
his office on a daily basis. A constant source of

03:11.223 --> 03:17.353
conversation once the legislature convened in 
January and He was elected and committee

03:18.633 --> 03:23.999
appointments were still pending. It wasn't until 
the night before the committee assignments were

03:25.261 --> 03:46.986
announced that the speaker pulled me aside at a 
reception and told me that he was appointing me

03:25.261 --> 03:46.986
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, 
that he had been under extreme pressure to name the

03:48.552 --> 03:57.063
person who had turned the tide in the speaker's 
race, but he just was not going to make that

03:48.552 --> 03:57.063
appointment.

03:59.727 --> 04:10.000
He did admonish me that I'd give A&M everything 
they wanted, but between the two of us, we'd take

03:59.727 --> 04:10.000
care of A&M. I told him he could always trust me to do 
what was right. Later there was not only a great

04:16.835 --> 04:28.470
deal of discussion about who would chair the 
Appropriations Committee, but probably more

04:16.835 --> 04:28.470
discussion about who would be the vice chairman. 
Baker at one point wanted to name the former

04:29.752 --> 04:37.281
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee 
as my vice chairman.

04:40.485 --> 04:41.847
Fortunately for me, he was talked out of that and 
said that it would not be fair to me as chairman to

04:43.092 --> 04:52.585
have a former chairman serving as my vice 
chairman. I did serve on the committee, but not as

04:54.567 --> 04:57.611
vice chairman. That first session in 1975 that I 
served as chairman of the Appropriations

04:59.774 --> 05:10.669
Committee was a very challenging one and a bigger 
tasks than I had imagined. Working under the new

05:16.409 --> 05:23.217
rules and in the open, the agencies of the state had 
become much more aggressive.

05:29.003 --> 05:37.273
Numerous members of the committee that had more 
seniority than I had in the serving in the

05:29.003 --> 05:37.273
legislature. Number five, chairman of major 
committees that served on the Appropriations

05:40.501 --> 05:46.188
Committee with me.

05:50.733 --> 06:08.955
The first major challenge that I faced from Fred 
Head, who had

05:50.733 --> 06:08.955
helped the Speaker get elected by throwing his 
support

05:50.733 --> 06:08.955
behind him,

06:12.108 --> 06:25.441
Prior to Labor Day, the

06:12.108 --> 06:25.441
named chairman of the Higher Education 
Committee, after his campaign to become chairman

06:12.108 --> 06:25.441
of the House Appropriations Committee, had fell 
short. In addition, he was a member of the House

06:27.664 --> 06:31.047
Appropriations Committee. As chairman of the 
Higher Education Committee, he had put together a

06:32.629 --> 06:40.917
proposal for funding higher education that

06:43.124 --> 06:46.349
was a severe attack on the Permanent University 
Fund. He had taken Permanent University Fund

06:47.671 --> 07:09.925
proceeds and appropriated for

06:47.671 --> 07:09.925
operations at Texas A&M University, which gutted 
the excellence fund that Texas A&M and the

06:47.671 --> 07:09.925
University of Texas had enjoyed over the years. 
Once I saw what Mr. Head was doing with his

07:11.221 --> 07:22.897
proposal, I decided that I had to pick an issue that 
I could beat him on. His proposal, he had refused to

07:22.917 --> 07:38.038
use updated enrollments because this would take 
another $17 million in general revenue funds to

07:22.917 --> 07:38.038
fund the updated enrollments. Mr. Head laid out 
his proposal. I asked if he had used updated

07:41.095 --> 07:43.918
enrollments. He said he had not. I immediately 
moved to use updated enrollments. He vehemently

07:51.446 --> 07:58.394
opposed it, saying that it was going to cost us $17 
million more to do so. And we took a vote, and he was

07:59.635 --> 08:04.380
resoundingly defeated. I then announced that the

08:04.799 --> 08:31.705
was adjourned pending the arrival of officials 
from the Texas A&M system and the University of

08:04.799 --> 08:31.705
Texas system who would appear before the 
Appropriations Committee to give testimony with

08:04.799 --> 08:31.705
regards to the use of the permanent university 
fund. We had not had a

08:33.959 --> 08:51.934
relation of the use of those proceeds and that Mr. 
Head was attempting to fund those without the

08:33.959 --> 08:51.934
committee having any knowledge of how those funds 
were being expended. The next day, the House

08:52.792 --> 09:16.506
Appropriations Committee convened with the 
chairman of the board of the University of Texas

08:52.792 --> 09:16.506
System, the former governor, Alan Shivers, and 
Jack Williams, chancellor of the Texas A&M

08:52.792 --> 09:16.506
University System, appearing before the 
committee explaining how the proceeds of the

08:52.792 --> 09:16.506
permanent university fund were being expended at 
the two institutions. Once those explanations

09:17.587 --> 09:19.390
were given,

09:22.171 --> 09:34.390
had little problem in rejecting Mr. Head's 
proposal that those funds be used for normal

09:22.171 --> 09:34.390
operations at Texas A&M and University of Texas. 
One of the lessons I learned in chairing the House

09:36.353 --> 09:50.575
Appropriations Committee that first year was the 
little attention sometimes that is paid to riders

09:36.353 --> 09:50.575
that are placed in the appropriations bill. The 
new rider placed in the bill by a House member that

09:51.972 --> 10:11.922
provided that a person who accrued sick leave when 
they left employment with the state could receive

09:51.972 --> 10:11.922
a payment for that sick leave. I was concerned 
about the rider when it went in, but decided that we

10:14.197 --> 10:30.758
could handle it in conference committee and was 
hopeful that the Senate would object to the rider

10:14.197 --> 10:30.758
and insist that it be taken out of the bill. 
Instead, little attention was given to it and the

10:32.220 --> 10:37.707
rider stayed in the bill. And as a result, many of 
the small agencies had difficulty in raising

10:38.294 --> 10:52.890
funds to pay for sick leave when some of their 
employees retired or left office. Not a workable

10:54.612 --> 11:06.765
provision because most agencies do not keep 
accurate records regarding sick leave days of the

10:54.612 --> 11:06.765
executive officials. they were getting paid for 
all of the sick leave days that they had accrued

11:08.011 --> 11:17.623
with very few sick leave days taken off. Another 
rider that became a problem and I had hoped would be

11:19.285 --> 11:37.528
overlooked was one that authorized Texas A&M 
University to cooperate with the South Texas

11:37.964 --> 11:41.587
College of Law with affiliation agreements. I was 
approached on a one-on-one basis by a senator on

11:43.689 --> 12:07.009
the conference committee who had asked me to 
support the rider and I agreed to if he would talk to

11:43.689 --> 12:07.009
the Speaker of the House and get his agreement. The 
speaker agreed. I showed the rider to my

12:09.633 --> 12:19.624
conferees, and of course they acceded to my wishes 
and said whatever I wanted to do. So the rider was

12:19.804 --> 12:26.412
placed in the appropriations bill at the 
conference committee level. Under the new rules

12:27.613 --> 12:37.384
of the House, any new language had to be placed on a 
resolution and passed in the House and the Senate.

12:38.579 --> 12:45.788
The Senate passes these resolutions, still to 
this day, passes the resolutions with little

12:38.579 --> 12:45.788
debate.

12:49.292 --> 13:08.316
The House might have done the same thing with 
regards to this particular provision, but in the

12:49.292 --> 13:08.316
process of putting it in the bill, one of the 
legislators overheard what we were doing and

13:09.089 --> 13:13.375
reported it to his legislator boss.

13:17.360 --> 13:33.662
When the resolution was presented, which is a 
rather thick document that shows all the changes

13:17.360 --> 13:33.662
in the bill, this one item was flagged for 
discussion.

13:36.308 --> 13:43.199
They had given very little thought to the rider and 
did not know exactly what it did. I knew that it did

13:43.239 --> 13:53.917
not create a law school, but there was no 
convincing the members of the legislature that it

13:43.239 --> 13:53.917
wasn't the first step to creating a law school. And 
a vote was taken and the provision was stricken.

14:02.684 --> 14:12.240
During the legislative session in 1975, Robert 
Preston, a half-brother, died suddenly of a heart

14:02.684 --> 14:12.240
attack. Robert was about ready to retire from 
Humble Oil and Refining Company in Baytown when

14:13.102 --> 14:22.498
this occurred. Father's first wife was Della Edge 
Presnell, and Robert was an offspring of that

14:23.508 --> 14:33.663
marriage. She died shortly after Robert's birth.

14:40.774 --> 14:44.379
My father subsequently married my mother. Della 
Edge Presnell was a twin sister to Ella Benbow.

14:54.625 --> 14:57.368
whose husband, Tom, ran a grocery store in Bryan. 
And Robert stayed with the Benbos much of the time

14:58.630 --> 15:06.699
as a young man. Thought of Aunt Ella and Uncle Tom 
Benbo as members of the family. All of us personal

15:15.810 --> 15:17.071
boys. September of 1975, shortly after that After 
the legislative session, my father died at the age

15:24.325 --> 15:28.711
of 83. He

15:28.811 --> 15:40.147
has a distinction of being the only man in Brazos 
County to have two sons serve in the legislature.

15:40.889 --> 15:47.017
There have only been two or three sets of brothers, 
to my knowledge, that have served in the

15:40.889 --> 15:47.017
legislature. I don't know the numbers, but there 
have been very few. My father always enjoyed

15:52.726 --> 16:05.218
politics and I think he enjoyed campaigning, that 
first campaign that I had in 1968. I'm glad that he

16:05.378 --> 16:14.847
lived to see me serve in a leadership position in 
the legislature before his death. I also lived to

16:14.867 --> 16:21.653
see the family farm that I operated and still 
operate under the family land heritage program of

16:22.392 --> 16:50.222
the department of agriculture requires the same 
family to operate the farm for over a hundred years

16:22.392 --> 16:50.222
my farm is part of the twenty three hundred and ten 
acres that great grandfather robert hutchpeth

16:22.392 --> 16:50.222
had acquired in eighteen sixty six nineteen 
seventy six the Texas Public Employees

16:50.725 --> 17:03.160
Association came to me and asked me to carry 
legislation that would provide that the state pay

16:50.725 --> 17:03.160
the employee portion of the Social Security tax. 
They had discussed this matter with former

17:04.261 --> 17:13.712
Secretary of Labor Marshall, who was a member of 
the University of Texas faculty, And he had

17:14.215 --> 17:28.050
assured them that this would be tax-free money to 
the employee

17:14.215 --> 17:28.050
by the state paying the employee's portion. 
Produced the bill in the House along with Senator

17:29.252 --> 17:38.262
Doggett introducing a companion bill, Senate 
Bill 20, in the Senate. With the bill passed, we had

17:39.884 --> 17:43.007
to make some concessions. we had to cap the payment 
at the then current rate of 5.85% and at the current

17:44.590 --> 18:01.031
level of $16,500 that the state would pay. When we 
passed the bill, we still did not know whether or

18:03.254 --> 18:11.965
not

18:03.254 --> 18:11.965
these funds would be tax-free to the employee. out 
later that they were not tax-free and very little

18:13.801 --> 18:26.860
advantage was received by the employees being 
paid this way. Fortunately, it took a long time to

18:28.041 --> 18:43.403
get the statute off the books because of the 
mechanics of backing out the payment in a fair and

18:28.041 --> 18:43.403
equitable way to the state employees. finally 
repealed in the mid-1990s. The issue that we spent

18:47.749 --> 19:03.411
a great deal of time trying to resolve was how to 
control off-campus programs within our

18:47.749 --> 19:03.411
community college system. Voices were being 
taught in

19:04.693 --> 19:12.023
various locations

19:14.281 --> 19:29.941
The state was having to pick up the tab, yet there 
was no control of the quality of these programs,

19:14.281 --> 19:29.941
and there were certainly a lot of questions 
regarding the

19:14.281 --> 19:29.941
standards that existed in a lot of them.

19:32.824 --> 19:39.633
Leadership positions of speaker, lieutenant 
governor, and governor did not change in 1977. We

19:40.174 --> 19:42.837
still had Bill Clayton as speaker, Bill Hobby as 
Lieutenant Governor and Dolph Briscoe as

19:43.458 --> 19:59.093
Governor, did see a rather dramatic change in the 
makeup of the membership of the House

19:43.458 --> 19:59.093
Appropriations Committee. The Speaker had 
decided that Chairman of the Committee would not

20:00.395 --> 20:12.807
serve concurrently on the Appropriations 
Committee. It's created a lot of vacancies, which

20:13.192 --> 20:21.421
he was more than happy to fill with people that 
wanted to serve on the Appropriations Committee.

20:22.903 --> 20:40.903
Because of these changes, I ended up with a 
majority of big spenders,

20:22.903 --> 20:40.903
lost control and committee of any ability to write 
a bill that would viable should it be sent directly

20:42.115 --> 20:45.398
to the comptroller. I rationalized to myself that 
this was not a problem, that I would have control in

20:45.418 --> 20:56.568
the conference committee and we could make the 
bill certify at that point. The problem that I ran

20:58.690 --> 21:10.401
into was that once we got the bill to the floor of the 
House, I had very little support for its passage.

21:12.440 --> 21:24.335
So we had to come up with some creative way to gain 
support of the bill and get it passed and over to the

21:12.440 --> 21:24.335
Senate and then to a conference committee. Had I 
known we would have the problems we had on the

21:24.355 --> 21:36.270
floor, I would have probably taken some positive 
action to reduce the total amount of the bill in

21:37.533 --> 21:43.942
committee just so that we could get the bill passed 
in the House and in a conference committee.

21:48.449 --> 22:00.125
The first three days we debated a bill making no 
progress in reducing the size of the bill which

21:48.449 --> 22:00.125
would be necessary to get the votes that we needed 
to pass it. On the evening of the third day, As I was

22:07.250 --> 22:27.618
preparing to get some rest

22:07.250 --> 22:27.618
alone in my apartment in the old Stephen F. Austin 
Hotel, when I heard this voice say, the author has

22:07.250 --> 22:27.618
the right to perfect his own bill. I put my head on my 
pillow. I realized that was the answer. that I had

22:36.815 --> 22:53.371
to offer

22:36.815 --> 22:53.371
perfecting amendments as the author of the bill to 
reduce the amount to a level that would be

22:36.815 --> 22:53.371
acceptable to the majority of the legislators. 
The next morning, I arrived at the Capitol early

22:54.732 --> 23:05.843
and directed staff to amend the bill back to the 
level that was approved originally by the

23:06.295 --> 23:13.405
Legislative Budget Board. In other words, cut out 
everything that the committee had put in the bill.

23:22.056 --> 23:26.162
We'd have to add some of it back in, but I thought we 
could get reductions that way. My first estimate

23:28.685 --> 23:35.695
was that we'd get about $200 million out of the bill 
and hope that that would get us the votes that we

23:28.685 --> 23:35.695
needed. As it turned out, we cut about $400 million 
out of the bill on the floor of the House through the

23:36.805 --> 23:46.844
author's perfecting amendments. This was 
unpopular and unprecedented and caused a lot of

23:48.667 --> 23:59.387
unrest, but it did get the bill approved. out of the 
house and into conference committee where we were

23:59.502 --> 24:06.771
able to make the necessary changes. I thought I had 
met head on one of the most difficult challenges

24:09.014 --> 24:15.002
that I had ever faced. Unfortunately, Texas 
Monthly did not view it that way.

24:26.789 --> 24:30.275
They came out with their list of the worst 10. My 
name was on it. The speaker assured me that in the

24:34.401 --> 24:43.296
future I would have more members that would 
support me on the Appropriations Committee.

24:45.459 --> 24:52.290
Depending upon the issue, about five votes out of 
the 21 is all that I had during that entire session.

24:54.515 --> 25:15.666
Later that year, during the interim, the Speaker 
had asked a friend of mine and I to travel to

24:54.515 --> 25:15.666
Olympia, Washington to review the

24:54.515 --> 25:15.666
interactive budget monitoring system that had 
been put in at the State Capitol in Olympia. The

25:17.068 --> 25:23.678
Capitol had hired a number of former Boeing 
aircraft employees that had intimate knowledge

25:24.535 --> 25:44.974
of how

25:24.535 --> 25:44.974
systems could be devised to provide support to the 
legislature with regards to budgetary matters.

25:47.517 --> 25:54.323
We were quite impressed with the system and came 
back to the Legislative Budget Board and proposed

25:54.961 --> 26:09.696
a feasibility study by Coopers and Libran to 
determine what it would take to put in a system in

25:54.961 --> 26:09.696
Texas. Things that would be required would be a 
uniform system of accounting, which Texas did not

26:11.638 --> 26:20.127
have within state government. And we realized 
that this would be required. The prison librarian

26:25.842 --> 26:33.772
did the study, and for a while that was, we thought, 
the end of it. Surprisingly, we found out that they

26:35.434 --> 26:54.077
were continuing to work and had ran up a $300,000 
bill that they presented to us without the

26:35.434 --> 26:54.077
legislature or the speaker or the lieutenant 
governor or anyone authorizing such an

26:54.175 --> 26:56.739
expenditure. I urged them that they should not be 
doing this, that we had no authorization to

26:56.799 --> 27:08.659
proceed.

27:13.346 --> 27:18.715
The program was never approved and probably 
should not have been. And the principles that

27:20.095 --> 27:31.148
authorized this work and by the Cooper's and 
Librand organization, I understand, were later

27:20.095 --> 27:31.148
fired. We did have in 1979

27:32.049 --> 27:43.723
or 81 had a resolution that would allow Cooper's 
and Librand to sue the state of Texas for their

27:44.311 --> 27:47.575
money that they had expended on this project. Of 
course, the legislature did not approve a

27:48.236 --> 27:59.370
resolution to sue itself, to allow itself to be 
sued, I mean, and so Coopers and Libran remains

27:48.236 --> 27:59.370
unpaid. In 1979, Bill Clayton continued to serve 
as Speaker and Bill Hobby as Lieutenant Governor,

28:01.073 --> 28:12.968
and we had the election of the first Republican 
governor in 100 years. Bill Clements was elected

28:16.745 --> 28:19.288
governor. Inflation rampant. It was necessary or 
prudent to give the state employees a pay raise. Do

28:33.164 --> 28:40.913
it on an emergency basis so that we could start 
catching up on where we had fallen behind. Senator

28:42.226 --> 28:49.655
Lloyd Doggett, a liberal Democrat, introduced 
the bill in the Senate at 6.8%. At that time,

28:49.755 --> 29:01.208
Governor Clements had given the bill to a freshman 
state representative in the House for

28:49.755 --> 29:01.208
introduction there.

29:05.132 --> 29:09.938
The Senate quickly passed its bill and sent it over 
to the House. I, in turn, asked the freshman House

29:12.095 --> 29:25.106
member to pick up the Senate bill, but that we would 
hold a hearing on his bill as well. Understood the

29:26.527 --> 29:33.753
protocol that the bill that passed first would be 
the one that would be used as a vehicle. Hearing was

29:35.394 --> 29:42.000
held, but before we reported the bill out of 
committee with any amendments, A conference was

29:43.313 --> 29:58.366
held in the governor's office, and agreement was 
reached that we would reduce the increase

29:43.313 --> 29:58.366
to state employees from 6.8% to 5.1%. There was a 
great deal of publicity given to the reduction

29:58.607 --> 30:11.498
that was made, and even though the leadership was 
all in concurrence,

30:14.650 --> 30:21.457
their

30:14.650 --> 30:21.457
mention ever made by this by the press. Two 
significant appropriations in the 1979 session,

30:23.499 --> 30:40.776
as far as Texas A&M University's system is 
concerned, was an appropriation to the vet clinic

30:23.499 --> 30:40.776
for its operations. In the past, the vet clinic was 
expected to be self-supporting and not receive

30:41.937 --> 30:55.673
any general revenue monies to operate the clinic. 
It was also the session that the purchase money for

30:55.693 --> 31:07.506
purchasing the Herman Professional Building in 
Houston for the Prairie View Nursing Program was

30:55.693 --> 31:07.506
provided. was always difficult to make decisions 
regarding

31:08.735 --> 31:20.356
private buildings for state use or to construct 
new buildings.

31:23.862 --> 31:31.536
Legislature just does not have a good handle on 
doing these kinds of things. How do you decide on a

31:32.883 --> 31:40.033
building in one part of the state versus a building 
in another part of the state? These are decisions

31:41.135 --> 31:48.946
that should be made at some other level rather than 
at the legislature level. Where in 1980 it was

31:48.966 --> 31:57.878
proposed that there be an appreciation dinner at 
the Brazos Center to make a show of support and

31:59.461 --> 32:08.513
raise some funds for my reelection campaign later 
that year, should there be one. My supporters

32:10.256 --> 32:14.161
decided that it should be a fish fry.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.748
Sounded like a great idea. The only problem is it 
turned out to be the coldest night of the year, and

32:19.788 --> 32:29.181
the fish would not thaw. When the fish that was 
frozen hit the grease, it would cool it down so fast

32:30.072 --> 32:45.567
that we could not buy fish fast enough for the crowd 
that we had that evening. the people that stayed at

32:47.285 --> 33:04.192
home and watched the appreciation dinner or saw 
the appreciation dinner on TV thought we had a huge

32:47.285 --> 33:04.192
overflow crowd because people were standing in 
line waiting to get their fish. The TV viewing

33:06.395 --> 33:13.326
audience did not know was that we couldn't get the 
fish to fry fast enough. I did file for reelection

33:14.875 --> 33:23.286
in 1980 in

33:14.875 --> 33:23.286
opposition.

33:25.509 --> 33:31.978
There were several major issues that faced the 
legislature in 1981.

33:34.741 --> 33:44.494
Bill had Bill Clayton as Speaker, Bill Hobby as 
Lieutenant Governor, and Bill Clements as

33:34.741 --> 33:44.494
Governor. The issue at the end of each decade is 
legislative redistricting. This indicated that

33:51.577 --> 33:59.909
Brazos County now represented a perfect 
district, population-wise. At first glance, one

34:01.091 --> 34:15.291
would think this would make it quite simple,

34:01.091 --> 34:15.291
but having a county with the exact population 
required for a legislative district does create

34:15.524 --> 34:16.725
problems. It removes flexibility that the 
writers of the redistricting bill would like to

34:18.647 --> 34:36.606
have in working with districts that surround the 
county with the right population. I know Brazos

34:37.707 --> 34:45.075
County was the only county that had such a 
population. The fact of Brazos County having a

34:46.439 --> 35:03.239
perfect population meant that two incumbent 
colleagues in the legislature just west of Brazos

34:46.439 --> 35:03.239
County ended up being paired. And the legislator 
to the east had some difficulty in getting the kind

35:04.020 --> 35:10.388
of district that he wanted. In the 1981 session, we 
once again met the challenge of constitutional

35:11.465 --> 35:21.198
amendment to the permanent university fund. 
There was an effort to rewrite the higher

35:22.540 --> 35:40.965
education portion of the constitution

35:22.540 --> 35:40.965
to deal primarily with the issue of how the schools 
outside of the permanent university fund are

35:22.540 --> 35:40.965
provided their construction funding.

35:45.360 --> 35:51.369
They had been using the 10 cent tax, i.e. 10 cents on 
a $100 valuation,

35:51.389 --> 36:02.886
to generate the revenues used by schools outside 
of the permanent university fund. There was a

36:04.823 --> 36:21.688
challenge to this fund as being 
unconstitutional, and it was one that we were

36:04.823 --> 36:21.688
likely to lose in the courts, thereby leaving 
these schools with no source of funds.

36:25.234 --> 36:29.380
Amendments are required to get 100 votes.

36:31.975 --> 36:42.766
An amendment to the proposal was offered to put 
Prairie View into the Permanent University Fund

36:31.975 --> 36:42.766
for 1-6. I

36:42.986 --> 36:59.383
felt like this was not

36:42.986 --> 36:59.383
in our best interest since Prairie View was 
actually over-built at the time and A&M was

36:42.986 --> 36:59.383
under-built. And to put a formula in the 
Constitution did not

37:00.241 --> 37:08.014
sense.

37:10.838 --> 37:18.551
I was defeated with regards to the amendment since 
it took only a majority vote. But I was able to

37:19.653 --> 37:26.063
garner enough votes in opposition to the 
amendment to keep it from getting the necessary

37:26.802 --> 37:31.386
100 votes required to pass. That brought a call 
from Governor Clements to meet in his office and

37:33.248 --> 37:40.514
discuss the issue. Governor Clements proceeded 
to advise me that Prairie View had not been treated

37:42.095 --> 37:56.708
fairly and started giving examples of 
construction items that had not been funded at

37:42.095 --> 37:56.708
Prairie View. I proceeded to point out to Governor 
Clements that all of the construction items that

37:58.392 --> 38:12.949
he had mentioned were items that only the 
legislature could provide the funds and not the

37:58.392 --> 38:12.949
A&M System Board of Regents. It is difficult to win 
an argument with the governor and particularly

38:14.311 --> 38:20.518
Governor Clements, I think I was able to persuade 
him that we were not going to give in on the issue and

38:20.954 --> 38:29.683
that there had to be some other resolution.

38:32.406 --> 38:42.877
The session adjourned without addressing the 
question of education funding in the

38:32.406 --> 38:42.877
Constitution. The issues that I have dealt with 
during my legislative years, the one that I caught

38:50.030 --> 39:01.121
the most flack from my colleagues was the one 
dealing with the teacher retirement system.

39:03.183 --> 39:19.378
Prior to the session in 1981, I had asked the 
Legislative Budget Board to consider what the

39:03.183 --> 39:19.378
ramifications would be if we passed a statute that 
required the teacher's retirement system to

39:19.865 --> 39:27.017
implement the rule of 85. The rule of 85 being that 
if your years toward retirement and your age

39:27.518 --> 39:42.244
totaled to be 85, you could draw full retirement. 
This was the system that was used in the state

39:43.203 --> 39:54.700
employee's retirement system, and I had had 
requests for this to be applied to the teacher

39:43.203 --> 39:54.700
retirement system. I quickly learned that the 
Legislative Budget Board did not get very good

39:56.503 --> 40:09.042
information from the teacher retirement system, 
and this had been a real problem.

40:11.823 --> 40:28.608
This request of mine gave them the impetus to seek 
information from outside sources regarding the

40:11.823 --> 40:28.608
viability of the teacher retirement system. The 
result of the study the Legislative Budget Board

40:29.870 --> 40:38.944
made, it was determined that the teacher 
retirement system could use their requirement

40:41.253 --> 40:54.449
for general revenue appropriations by $217 
million and still be the most viable retirement

40:41.253 --> 40:54.449
system in the nation. The budget board met just 
prior to the legislative session.

41:00.997 --> 41:08.847
It was decided to go ahead and expend those funds 
through the appropriations process on the

41:08.962 --> 41:20.655
assumption that a bill would be passed that would 
reduce the money flowing into the teacher's

41:08.962 --> 41:20.655
retirement system by $217 million. I had made all 
kinds of compromises with the teacher retirement

41:22.397 --> 41:30.506
system to get the bill passed. The Retired 
Teachers Association, they continued to hammer

41:30.846 --> 41:35.391
away on their own legislators to the point it was 
extremely difficult to get the bill passed.

41:47.288 --> 42:00.949
Members that supported me on the issue to get it 
passed apparently heard from their retirees into

41:47.288 --> 42:00.949
the teacher retirement system for years to come. 
In 1981, Ross Perot was heading up a program called

42:05.645 --> 42:13.676
War on Drugs. This was to get some bills passed in 
the legislature that would help curb the drug

42:13.697 --> 42:21.548
traffic in Texas. I met with Mr. Perot

42:22.830 --> 42:35.027
prior to the session in College Station here and 
was supportive of what he was trying to do.

42:38.129 --> 42:52.808
He had asked me to carry several of the bills, but I 
declined on a basis that, as chairman of the House

42:38.129 --> 42:52.808
Appropriations Committee, I just did not have the 
time to carry additional bills. But I would help in

42:54.069 --> 43:01.278
every way that I could to see that, to help get the 
bills passed through the legislature. I asked him

43:03.021 --> 43:07.326
to take to a friend of mine And I told this friend I 
would help him with it. It was a bill that required a

43:12.062 --> 43:25.780
triplicate prescription of all drugs that were 
considered dangerous. I had a bill in the

43:26.080 --> 43:35.052
Appropriations Committee to make Martin Luther 
King's birthday a holiday. The members of the

43:36.685 --> 43:45.259
committee were not supportive at all of this bill, 
and I knew that the votes were not there. I did want

43:47.082 --> 43:53.413
to do something with regards to holidays because 
it had been something somewhat controversial.

43:55.756 --> 44:02.187
I kept telling the author of the Martin Luther King 
birthday bill that I... was working on something

44:03.280 --> 44:31.870
and that i would uh... give him a hearing at the time 
i got the other bill worked up and i found out that he

44:03.280 --> 44:31.870
was uh... not letting the triplicate 
prescription bill come out of his committee even

44:03.280 --> 44:31.870
though the votes in the committee were there the 
triplicate prescription bill uh... was a concept

44:03.280 --> 44:31.870
that would hopefully reduce dangerous drugs by a 
considerable amount. Finally, the author of the

44:38.592 --> 44:47.648
bill brought the speaker to my desk and said, we 
want to get the bill out of committee. And I said,

44:48.489 --> 44:54.700
fine, I'll give you a hearing on your bill if you'll 
pass out the triplicate prescription bill. His

44:56.783 --> 44:58.566
reaction was, no way. that lasted about ten 
seconds, and he came back and said, okay, it's a

44:59.727 --> 45:03.953
deal. So I attempted to get his bill out once he had 
passed the triplicate prescription bill out, and

45:05.555 --> 45:19.794
of course I could not get the bill, necessary votes 
to pass the bill. Understand that the triplicate

45:21.897 --> 45:29.667
prescription bill has reduced drug trafficking 
by a significant amount. 1981 was one of the first

45:30.676 --> 45:36.764
years we had to deal with teachers' pay in the 
Appropriations Committee.

45:39.809 --> 45:51.064
We're falling behind in their pay because of the 
high rate of inflation and the fact that teachers

45:39.809 --> 45:51.064
have always been underpaid. One thing that I 
wanted to avoid was the bill

46:02.722 --> 46:05.968
more funds than the comptroller could certify. 
The member who was handling the education portion

46:07.752 --> 46:18.233
of the appropriations bill made a proposal to 
provide a 28.5% increase for school teachers. I

46:24.934 --> 46:33.743
knew what the fiscal implications were and did not 
support his proposal. Consequently, it was

46:35.685 --> 46:37.186
killed.

46:40.450 --> 46:48.118
The speaker immediately contacted me and said 
that was his proposal and He wanted it brought up. I

46:49.858 --> 46:51.202
said, we don't have the money. He said, I've got the 
money for you. I said, okay, if you assure me we've

46:53.910 --> 47:01.492
got the money for you, I'll find a way to bring it 
back up and we'll get it passed. So after a few

47:01.512 --> 47:03.357
hours, it passed.
