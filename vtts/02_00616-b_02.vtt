WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:10.716
stuck to that that in effect we organize our 
lecture and our instruction ecologically rather

00:02.022 --> 00:10.716
than many other places have done. we can, and 
deliberately so, but it is in Seattle especially

00:11.455 --> 00:34.155
easy because the departments of zoology and of 
botany have strong marine programs or have

00:11.455 --> 00:34.155
faculty with strong marine interests so that we 
don't have to teach our students algology for

00:11.455 --> 00:34.155
oceanographers or invertebrates for 
oceanographers. So we send them to the basic

00:34.175 --> 00:41.462
sciences and let them pick it up there and we can 
afford them to talk about the ocean as inhabited

00:41.442 --> 01:08.867
for marine organisms talk about benthos or 
plankton I began to lecture on the upper division

00:41.442 --> 01:08.867
level about general biological oceanography 
along the lines I had indicated earlier along the

00:41.442 --> 01:08.867
lines of my training although the first time 
around or the first one and a half times around I

00:41.442 --> 01:08.867
think it was still three quarters or so biology of 
marine organisms but Since then, it was

01:09.151 --> 01:28.577
biological oceanography proper, with strong 
emphasis on production biology, very little on

01:09.151 --> 01:28.577
zoogeography, or biogeography, which I consider 
to be another legitimate part of biological

01:09.151 --> 01:28.577
oceanography, but I didn't know much about it, so 
it was primarily production biology. And I

01:30.211 --> 01:41.287
lectured to biologists and non-biologists, that 
is, biological oceanographers and

01:30.211 --> 01:41.287
non-biological oceanographers, who in those 
years all were sitting through the same courses.

01:41.407 --> 01:51.883
And these upper division lectures were 
prescribed in our undergraduate curriculum, but

01:41.407 --> 01:51.883
all graduate students who came from the outside 
had to take them, too. So it was a very mixed

01:52.063 --> 01:54.987
audience. The biologists in those years often 
accused me of that I really did not address them,

01:55.760 --> 02:23.404
but I was addressing the other ones, the 
non-biologists, because I treated life in the

01:55.760 --> 02:23.404
ocean, which they had come to study, I treated life 
in the ocean strictly in terms of carbon or

01:55.760 --> 02:23.404
chlorophyll and so on, which is very easy then for 
physical and say chemical oceanographers to

01:55.760 --> 02:23.404
understand, but not very not firing up the 
imagination of the biologists but this emphasis

02:24.008 --> 02:47.333
was not really to please the non-biologists or to 
make it easy for them but it was really my way of

02:24.008 --> 02:47.333
outlook that I thought that in terms of 
chlorophyll you can compare the North Pacific

02:24.008 --> 02:47.333
with the North Atlantic or the North Pacific in the 
temperate North Pacific with the tropical North

02:47.920 --> 02:51.972
Pacific. Whereas if you had species lists, well, 
you couldn't really. So it was designed. But many

02:57.789 --> 03:00.256
bollushes were very unhappy and still are. But 
that is just my way of looking at the world. At that

03:04.559 --> 03:09.143
time, I thought already of writing it up, writing a 
textbook. The lecture notes, at least, were

03:09.464 --> 03:20.194
organized such that they were proper referencing 
where did I get this idea from and where did that

03:09.464 --> 03:20.194
slide come from, because there was no book which 
treated the ocean. There was no book on biological

03:20.214 --> 03:22.055
oceanography. The oceans were way outdated 
already then. I think they were outdated when they

03:24.978 --> 03:28.101
were written, as far as biology is concerned. 
Otherwise, a very good book, but in biology, quite

03:28.241 --> 03:32.305
so so. Well, I will come back to that book later. I 
didn't get to it yet.

03:38.740 --> 03:50.749
I did draw early on the results of model studies, of 
theoretical studies in biological

03:38.740 --> 03:50.749
oceanography, which also was done rarely in those 
years. But because I was not trained

03:51.202 --> 04:01.054
mathematically enough, I could not really teach 
by means of models, which would be the most elegant

03:51.202 --> 04:01.054
way. Nobody did it in those years except Reilly 
himself. But at least I used the results and said,

04:04.058 --> 04:11.447
look, students, that is the future. And again, 
until very recently, until Parsons' textbook

04:13.690 --> 04:20.719
came about, there was no text on which you could 
draw.

04:25.508 --> 04:31.296
As far as research is concerned, I emphasize 
plankton methods. I continue to be interested in

04:31.376 --> 04:37.544
methods, and especially of the assessment of 
phytoplankton standing stock. That is the

04:38.145 --> 04:40.669
inheritance from cry. I was a little disenchanted 
with the chemical method, but I also did not want to

04:42.111 --> 04:47.618
have phytoplankton theses and phytoplankton 
written which just had long species lists. So in

04:52.843 --> 05:01.573
the first years, very much on my mind was the 
problem of how to convert from species lists into

04:52.843 --> 05:01.573
mass estimates. And the theses by Lawrence, for 
example, and by Hobson, the master theses by both,

05:01.593 --> 05:12.525
and also by Strathman were very much concerned 
with those issues. In a way, I did not continue with

05:15.104 --> 05:34.699
zooplankton work, and the reason is that in 1961, 
there was a symposium held in Copenhagen on

05:15.104 --> 05:34.699
zooplankton, which was to be the successor to that 
mentioned 1957 symposium on primal production.

05:35.810 --> 05:40.919
The zooplankton symposium was not nearly as good 
as the phytoplankton symposium, but that's

05:35.810 --> 05:40.919
besides the point. I was invited, no, I think I 
contributed a paper on the role of the small

05:41.760 --> 05:54.582
zooplankton, which nobody on this continent at 
that time talked about, which is again bringing

05:41.760 --> 05:54.582
up, reminding the people of the Lohmann idea. I 
just reviewed literature and said, now look,

05:54.602 --> 06:01.193
there are many, many organisms which slip through 
the meshes you use. and I was invited to give a

06:02.489 --> 06:14.507
review on the vertical distribution of 
soroplankton, which I did, but that was not well

06:02.489 --> 06:14.507
done in my opinion, so I rewrote it and re-expanded 
it and finished that in 1963 and that was published

06:15.517 --> 06:21.626
in 1964. And in that review, of course I reviewed 
among other things the vertical migration issue,

06:22.547 --> 06:33.102
pointing out that very often organisms don't 
migrate, which I had mentioned before. But I also

06:34.263 --> 06:44.798
elaborated on, or I touched upon, the problem of 
the vertical distribution of very small

06:34.263 --> 06:44.798
zooplankton, say CLJs and nauplii, in the mixed 
layer. and When I finished that review, I thought

06:47.208 --> 07:09.618
the only really interesting aspect in 
zooplankton work, besides biogeography, which

06:47.208 --> 07:09.618
is a different issue, but otherwise the only 
really important issue before us is this question

06:47.208 --> 07:09.618
of the zooplankton as a mixed layer, which ties 
into production studies, and I can't go into this.

07:10.739 --> 07:16.827
The upshot as far as my own scientific future is 
concerned was that I realized that I couldn't do it

07:10.739 --> 07:16.827
myself. First, it involved revisiting of 
populations, which is objectively difficult to

07:17.262 --> 07:26.625
come back to the same population in the open sea. It 
can't be done even now. But the other issue is of the

07:29.051 --> 07:33.482
statistical problems. to which I can't go into 
either, but at any rate I realized that I didn't

07:34.137 --> 07:48.970
have the equipment, training-wise, nor the 
logistics behind me, and so I just left it at that,

07:34.137 --> 07:48.970
and it is only beginning to be picked up now. Well, 
people begin to think about along these lines now.

07:53.995 --> 08:02.743
But I was so discouraged that I just left 
zooplankton work, distribution work, and have

07:53.995 --> 08:02.743
never done it ever since, although, of course, I 
still lecture about it.

08:05.693 --> 08:12.202
the, what shall I say, I was to say major 
accomplishment, but that is a little too much.

08:13.104 --> 08:20.073
What I had to do here is teach oceanography, of 
course, and get biological oceanography and get

08:13.104 --> 08:20.073
the research going. And what I realized very early 
was that the teaching of biological

08:21.876 --> 08:35.295
oceanography, whatever there was, was directed 
at the open ocean entirely, that biological

08:21.876 --> 08:35.295
oceanography or the interaction of life with the 
sea was treated as if there was no bottom but of

08:35.917 --> 08:59.038
course it is obvious and was obvious then that much 
of the research amid much of the interaction

08:35.917 --> 08:59.038
between man and the sea and much of the research our 
students would have to do would be concerned with

08:35.917 --> 08:59.038
the ocean on the shelf and on the shelf of course you 
can't neglect the seabed So I began to introduce

08:59.575 --> 09:10.579
benthic teaching, teaching on the benthos, and 
also to bring in, to build up a research effort. The

09:11.841 --> 09:14.968
research effort was in part In expansion of the 
Plumpton work, I wanted to try to apply chemical

09:16.889 --> 09:29.843
methods, quick methods, to an assessment of the 
overall activity of the community and the overall

09:16.889 --> 09:29.843
concentration. And out of this attempt came 
Pramatma's work, who is one of my best students, I

09:30.684 --> 09:37.071
think. Very much independent, but still my 
student. He introduced the determination of

09:41.864 --> 09:48.899
oxygen consumption by the seabed. It had been 
invented by somebody else, but he really made a

09:49.099 --> 09:53.629
golden proposition out of it. We realized, of 
course, that we could not, this is early 1960s now,

09:55.465 --> 10:16.359
we realized that we would have to work on the 
organisms too, and so I looked around for money to

09:55.465 --> 10:16.359
take up classical benthic quantitative work and 
invited, advertised for it, and we invited a

09:55.465 --> 10:16.359
Norwegian, Mr. Lee, to come here. And Lee then 
very, who was originally a plantologist but

10:17.501 --> 10:22.249
learned the literature very, very quickly and 
again was very independent, but in effect he

10:22.904 --> 10:33.910
started our Benthic work here and then very 
quickly got ahead of many other concurrent

10:34.565 --> 10:57.387
workers by introducing methods in plant 
sociology into well-developed mathematical

10:34.565 --> 10:57.387
methods into the marine domain, and therefore 
advanced the field very much beyond what was done

10:34.565 --> 10:57.387
by the Danish school, which dominated the east 
coast of this country until ten years later

10:34.565 --> 10:57.387
almost. Lee, if I remember correctly, came in late 
1962.

11:04.973 --> 11:07.498
For Lee, I identified the polychaetes. I sort of, I 
agreed to identify the polychaetes because, of

11:07.578 --> 11:20.081
course, that's always an issue now if you take 
these many samples, who is going to identify,

11:07.578 --> 11:20.081
recognize the species, and then count them before 
you can start thinking about them. And Lee took the

11:20.702 --> 11:25.311
Causatians and a colleague of... a professional, 
Mr. Kiska, took the bivalves and the cannadomes,

11:25.612 --> 11:31.641
and there were a few others helping in the minor 
groups. I said, well, sure, I take the polykids

11:32.242 --> 11:35.426
because I knew them. I also had looked at a few 
samples here, and uninhabited, in sand, where

11:43.955 --> 11:46.879
usually you find new species. If you want to find 
new species, that was the lesson learned in Kiel by

11:46.939 --> 11:54.570
Remane, look at clean sand and you will find just 
one species after another. And so I had done here

11:54.610 --> 12:02.281
just to find out how well known is this region, 
using the clean sand as sort of the yardstick. If

12:02.702 --> 12:08.410
many species were unknown, then who knows what 
kind of surprises would wait on Markbottom, say. I

12:08.896 --> 12:19.473
took a few samples, two I believe, and there was 
only one new species and so I was quite relaxed and

12:08.896 --> 12:19.473
certainly sure I can identify for using 
polychaetes, of course through research

12:08.896 --> 12:19.473
assistance students. It turned out that was a 
great mistake. The polychaete fauna wasn't well

12:23.339 --> 12:32.895
known and in the years since then, since 1962 or 3, 
we have added all

12:34.630 --> 12:39.661
The polycate found 170% of what it was when we 
started out. And in effect, I have been trapped

12:40.603 --> 12:45.253
since then in identifying polycates. Not 
identifying, but describing polycates, making

12:46.396 --> 12:52.048
revisions, and writing keys. together with one of 
my students. And I'm just now in the process of

12:54.736 --> 12:57.980
winding that up. I hope in another year I will 
finish this second volume to the polykids of

12:58.100 --> 13:04.268
British Columbia and Washington. That's a 
natural unit. And then get rid of it because

13:06.150 --> 13:14.340
the initial excitement has worn off, which always 
it does. But more importantly, In an oceanography

13:16.953 --> 13:21.342
department, this is a little out of place. Of 
course, biological oceanographers have to know

13:21.823 --> 13:24.108
organisms. Otherwise, if they don't tack on the 
name or pin on the name to the organisms, they can't

13:24.188 --> 13:32.246
use the literature because the name only opens to 
the literature. But to spend much time on working

13:36.106 --> 13:39.835
on the taxonomy, that is really what the ologists 
are being paid for. And the disadvantage then is

13:40.938 --> 13:52.326
that I do the logical work here, which is fine, 
nobody is against it, but I can't train students in

13:40.938 --> 13:52.326
it. Because if I say, where to train poly-kid 
students in oceanography, they still would have

13:52.306 --> 14:06.201
to take all the physical courses and all the 
chemical oceanography and what have you, and in

13:52.306 --> 14:06.201
consequence wouldn't have enough knowledge of 
entomology and of physiology and what have you.

14:06.802 --> 14:09.025
And so they would not be really competitive. Which 
jobs would they take? They would not be full

14:10.987 --> 14:16.693
zoologists, but they wouldn't be full 
oceanographers either. I think it's not good for

14:17.652 --> 14:38.880
my role as a teacher to continue to work on the 
polygates, even if I enjoyed it, which I don't

14:17.652 --> 14:38.880
anymore, because keys are just tools, very 
important tools, but you never get them in a

14:17.652 --> 14:38.880
textbook, you never become famous, because you 
just sharpen tools for the others. And so when I'm

14:39.882 --> 14:43.547
through these keys, I will not regret it. As I said, 
very important, but I don't say anything about the

14:43.847 --> 14:47.592
ocean. So that was really a trap into which I got 
half of my papers now on polychaetes, not about the

14:48.922 --> 14:57.632
ocean or plankton methods at all.

15:02.050 --> 15:16.565
Now, to finish this treatment of what we did in the 
Bentos, we added, of course, a Bentos faculty, but

15:02.050 --> 15:16.565
on a faculty, teaching faculty, so that I didn't 
have to lecture about it. But again, we had

15:17.145 --> 15:21.850
somebody who didn't stick to it, who didn't 
publish. That happens, of course. And because of

15:23.152 --> 15:30.319
the funding problems for and for Lee, who were on 
soft money, We just couldn't keep them here

15:31.278 --> 15:39.807
because they were receiving offers all the time 
and said, well, if you people can't give me a

15:31.278 --> 15:39.807
tenured position, well, I will just leave. And so 
they did. And after Parmakmat left, who was the

15:41.109 --> 15:49.858
last one, in 72 or 73, the whole Bento's effort was 
really for naught. We had been on the map for a

15:50.339 --> 15:54.383
while, but that was it. People still write here and 
want to study Bentos, but of course that is for

15:56.033 --> 16:04.502
reasons of publications done ten years ago. And if 
now somebody speaks about theater, work on

16:05.603 --> 16:21.079
Bentos, he usually means, or she usually means 
Paine's work in the zoology department, which

16:05.603 --> 16:21.079
has, or who, Paine rather, who since the mid-60s 
has really developed new ideas which have

16:21.599 --> 16:34.936
fertilized, so to speak, ecology in general, not 
just marine work, but ecology in general. And that

16:35.557 --> 16:41.464
is why one ought to come here to study Inventor's 
work. Although I must make him a qualifier, now we

16:41.832 --> 17:10.320
have hired somebody new a year ago, Peter, or two 
years ago, Peter Jumas, who is this young

16:41.832 --> 17:10.320
generation, first of all, he's very good, but also 
this young generation where the training is so

16:41.832 --> 17:10.320
much better that all the time I'm just embarrassed 
in talking to him, which happens to all older

16:41.832 --> 17:10.320
people, I suppose, that the younger generation is 
better trained, and the only... handicap they

17:10.503 --> 17:25.727
have is that they don't have enough experience 
that I know just by experience what the answer is

17:10.503 --> 17:25.727
whereas they have to derive it and it takes them 
half a minute for the derivation but once they have

17:10.503 --> 17:25.727
the experience of course we are the old people are 
just old well So my work in Bentos, in a way, has not

17:26.298 --> 17:40.291
been too successful because of these 
institutional restraints or accidents, if you

17:26.298 --> 17:40.291
want to put it this way, that you hire somebody and 
he doesn't pan out.

17:44.235 --> 17:46.177
That was through the 60s. During the mid-60s, I

17:46.677 --> 17:54.685
began to become interested in national ocean 
politics. I was, from 1964 to 1970, the biologist

17:55.880 --> 18:04.631
on NASCO, the Academy Committee on Oceanography, 
about which I don't have to tell you anything, I

17:55.880 --> 18:04.631
suppose. I was the successor of Dixie Lee Ray, who 
now is our governor. And I also participated in

18:11.339 --> 18:25.296
those years on other committees, on national 
levels, visiting committees and advisory boards

18:11.339 --> 18:25.296
and what have you, and also was active in 
university self-governance here.

18:26.052 --> 18:30.821
It was only a sort of temporary love affair. After a 
few years, during which I learned very, very much.

18:34.107 --> 18:35.389
These were very interesting years. After a few 
years, I began to become disenchanted, perhaps

18:35.910 --> 18:44.787
through my own development, further 
development, but also because NASCO, was not

18:45.340 --> 18:51.706
longer a very effective speaker in the late 60s on 
the national stage. There were so many others now

18:51.726 --> 19:00.534
speaking for oceanography, and, of course, owing 
to the war, the general national scene was

18:51.726 --> 19:00.534
slightly confused, to put it mildly. So it wasn't 
very interesting anymore, and Nazgul only had to

19:00.574 --> 19:07.760
speak, address politics, question, kill brush 
fires here and there. There was no science

19:07.800 --> 19:08.961
anymore. So when they were dissolved under 
Calhoun's leadership, Calhoun saw to it that it

19:13.623 --> 19:18.450
was restructured, and I was glad to be rotated off. 
And I guess it had to do with my development, too.

19:24.719 --> 19:27.883
Since those years, I have sort of withdrawn. I've 
withdrawn a little too strong, but I'm not so long

19:29.045 --> 19:35.935
as interested in working on this committee and 
that university panel. which in part is my own

19:37.231 --> 19:50.712
development, but many other colleagues after the 
Vietnam experience, on this campus at least, have

19:37.231 --> 19:50.712
withdrawn and are not longer so active helping to 
run the university, but just leave it to the

19:37.231 --> 19:50.712
president or administrators to the dean. So in a 
way, I'm a child of my age, of course, and that I

19:51.653 --> 20:00.387
have, in other words, I have returned to research 
and teaching. I certainly am not interested in

20:00.788 --> 20:09.737
administration as a profession, although I see 
the virtue and the challenge to it. But right now,

20:09.757 --> 20:14.382
I'm still an active scientist. And of course, 10 
years later, who knows? But during the 60s, I had

20:16.744 --> 20:21.969
the choice several times to become largely the 
administrator. And I said, no. And still, 10 years

20:23.350 --> 20:25.753
later, I don't regret it. But as I said, another 10 
years, who knows? So what is really left now is to

20:30.202 --> 20:37.091
say what kind of research I have done in the 70s. 
Part of the research, half of the papers is

20:38.593 --> 20:45.382
polykids, as I mentioned, and I hope to wind it up 
soon.

20:49.007 --> 20:54.594
I do have the textbook still on my mind, and I will 
come back to this later.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.141
There was the... Let me say that I mentioned that 
symposium on primary productivity in 1957, which

21:02.180 --> 21:23.358
was the first summary of what was going on, but 
which also was a milestone and led us on for a few

21:02.180 --> 21:23.358
very active years in primary productivity 
research, which was all done by chemical methods.

21:23.378 --> 21:25.943
Carbon-14, in a way, is a chemical method. 
chlorophyll is a chemical method, nobody looked

21:25.923 --> 21:47.982
through the microscope anymore, but by 1965 or so 
the cream was off, sort of, and many people,

21:25.923 --> 21:47.982
including me, thought that the demise is inside 
and so get off and do something better, and I got

21:25.923 --> 21:47.982
into the force by the circumstances, got into the 
bentos, more or less.

21:50.729 --> 22:03.709
And for others it appeared clear, and I agreed at 
that time, that secondary production, animal

21:50.729 --> 22:03.709
production, would now be the most important 
theme, which would, of course, bring us back to

21:50.729 --> 22:03.709
zooplankton, but it was not so much so plant and 
distribution, but it was clear that we would have

22:03.959 --> 22:19.568
to do very much work in the lab on grazing rates, on 
growth rates, and so on and so forth, which several

22:03.959 --> 22:19.568
people then did, but I didn't join because it 
didn't interest me so much. But that was in the

22:19.928 --> 22:27.402
mid-60s what seemed to be the important part, and I 
tried to push it on the national level, too, and

22:19.928 --> 22:27.402
secondary product on the bottom. get away from 
just counting animals but say now what do they do,

22:27.668 --> 22:33.818
how fast do they grow, what do they do to each other. 
What do they do to each other is what pain is doing

22:34.239 --> 22:40.009
and I try to push now how fast is it being done. And 
what does a mud bottom do to the overlying sea water

22:40.790 --> 22:46.460
in contrast to a sand bottom? What's the 
difference between sand and mud bottom when you

22:46.480 --> 22:51.909
view it from above, from the water? Is there any 
difference? So these kinds of issues of secondary

22:53.791 --> 23:00.848
production I thought would be interesting, but I 
largely talked about it without doing very much.

23:05.587 --> 23:10.953
It turned out then that the assessment of the 
primary production of that demise was not quite

23:05.587 --> 23:10.953
right. Primarily under Dugdale's leadership, 
the field has been reopened and is now really

23:11.594 --> 23:17.601
moving again. We realized, and Dugdale has done 
that before he came here, but he was, Dugdale was

23:18.782 --> 23:28.954
here for quite a while, and you ought to talk to 
Dugdale, really, history of oceanography in

23:18.782 --> 23:28.954
Maine. You might want to note that down. Duckdale 
put modern plant physiology together with what we

23:32.857 --> 23:38.825
have done so before. What he tried to do, and still 
is, to predict plant growth from, that is, a rate,

23:38.905 --> 23:51.762
from the nutrient concentrations, which we had 
looked at in a far too simple-minded way before.

23:51.862 --> 23:59.792
And it turned out that this involves a lot of lab 
work, which is still going on, but also very much

23:51.862 --> 23:59.792
more sophisticated sampling at sea. So that he 
built up here, and I'm sorry, he also pointed out

24:00.481 --> 24:19.437
and did do something about it, that more 
mathematical modeling is needed, which he didn't

24:00.481 --> 24:19.437
invent, but he tried to build up a group where 
everything was done at the same time. So there was a

24:19.557 --> 24:22.523
lot of interaction about it. But I guess because of 
different temperaments, I think that's the

24:23.870 --> 24:36.073
principal reason, but also because of the way we 
are spread through different buildings. We

24:36.796 --> 24:38.899
really never cooperated. This building did its 
thing, and Duckdale and the other building did his

24:38.939 --> 24:56.543
thing, and they had different coffee pots, met 
every day, and when the interests diverged, went

24:38.939 --> 24:56.543
on different expeditions, so we developed really 
in a different manner. so much that when people

24:57.046 --> 25:13.034
here on this floor looked for mathematicians and 
hired a very good mathematician, Winter, to work

24:57.046 --> 25:13.034
on productivity data, local productivity data in 
Puget Sound, whereas Duckville never looked at

24:57.046 --> 25:13.034
local water. They always had thought of 
subtropical regions for good reasons. So when we

25:17.482 --> 25:23.368
hired this new man, even our modeling approach was 
different from theirs. So there were really two

25:23.508 --> 25:28.753
modeling groups in Seattle, which must have 
looked very strange to the outside. But that is the

25:29.434 --> 25:31.316
way it went. Different traditions within the same 
place, which is a function of size and script that

25:31.776 --> 25:39.904
happens, too, that people don't know what Miller 
does in the other one. Because they never eat with

25:40.365 --> 25:42.447
each other. One has his lunch group, the other one 
this one. So in a way, we were a... victim of size. At

25:49.506 --> 26:07.992
any rate, by introducing Winter into the field, he 
taught in the first year primarily to me, I learned

25:49.506 --> 26:07.992
a great deal about modeling and what good it can do, 
which reinforced my youth really, but I also came

25:49.506 --> 26:07.992
back to primary production in a way. and also 
realized that what was missing in oceanography to

26:09.423 --> 26:25.272
really make the big next step after the 
introduction of the carbon-14 method was, yes,

26:09.423 --> 26:25.272
all right, more secondary production, but more 
importantly, to have more theory. Not to have more

26:25.252 --> 26:39.189
expedition, more data, and El Said in Texas A&M is 
the one who says we need more data and continues to

26:25.252 --> 26:39.189
go to the Antarctic Ocean, which I very much admire 
because it's an awful place to go. But I think, in my

26:39.790 --> 26:45.657
opinion, that is an opinion, we need more theory. 
into which to fit new data. There are enough data

26:47.439 --> 26:59.375
laying around to construct theory and then try to 
test the theory or discard or substantiate it,

26:47.439 --> 26:59.375
rather than to continue to take observations at 
sea. That is what I learned from Winter, among

26:59.395 --> 27:02.659
other things. So in a way, then, we are again

27:04.922 --> 27:15.576
back to primary production, in a way, but we don't 
do it very actively. Winter was hired in 1970, and

27:17.227 --> 27:23.192
the big paper came out in 74, the big paper on Puget 
Sound. And in the meantime, we have another paper

27:23.212 --> 27:25.655
in press. But this development was interrupted by 
a sabbatical, which I spent at Scripps in, yeah,

27:26.095 --> 27:37.525
now I don't know, 71 to 72, I guess so. Or 72 to 73, I 
don't recall. At any rate, I went there not only to

27:40.568 --> 27:44.972
have the sabbatical, but to write the textbook. 
But because I didn't know how to spend a

27:46.285 --> 27:51.293
sabbatical, I didn't manage quite. The mistake I 
made was that I had an obligation here to finish an

27:51.513 --> 28:11.365
article with a co-author, and there was another 
manuscript which was almost ready and had been

27:51.513 --> 28:11.365
sitting on my desk for a year, and when I came to 
Scripps and for the first time had time to think

27:51.513 --> 28:11.365
about it leisurely without all the time somebody 
coming in or hurrying away to lectures, I saw how

27:51.513 --> 28:11.365
bad it was. There was a month gone for this and for 
that. So I really wrote only for two or three

28:13.989 --> 28:16.993
months. Now I know how to write it, and I also know 
that I have to restrict my scope considerably.

28:25.906 --> 28:29.191
Originally, I wanted to write a textbook for 
biological oceanography. All of it. And there is

28:33.217 --> 28:35.421
no book yet which does it. Although there are a few 
multi-author books, it is still not a book you can

28:35.561 --> 28:40.508
use in class.
