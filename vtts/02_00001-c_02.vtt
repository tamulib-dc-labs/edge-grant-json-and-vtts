WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:08.085
Any information to share with this machine about how the Big 12 came to be formed?

00:08.105 --> 00:08.446
Oh, yes.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.968
There's some interesting stories there.

00:12.711 --> 00:18.959
This was turmoil going on for several years, and were you in Missouri at the time?

00:19.319 --> 00:19.540
Okay.

00:20.220 --> 00:26.308
So, you know the inside story.

00:27.655 --> 00:41.031
The Big 12 was a compromise, of course, and the first get-together for this group was a very sterile affair.

00:41.872 --> 00:53.325
Several years before it happened, the Southwest Conference was thinking that we needed to do something, and so somebody, probably Fred Jacoby, made contact with the Big 8.

00:54.638 --> 01:03.536
And we had a dinner session where we all sort of sat around and wondered what we were doing there.

01:03.996 --> 01:07.684
I don't know that any interesting exchange took place.

01:07.704 --> 01:11.010
So then we all go off and two years later we've all forgotten about it.

01:11.892 --> 01:14.397
And now then, all kinds of turmoil is going on.

01:15.579 --> 01:16.461
The Pac-10,

01:17.403 --> 01:18.545
I was thinking of expanding.

01:18.605 --> 01:22.913
I think the Big Ten had just taken in Penn State.

01:24.276 --> 01:27.762
And Arkansas had just left to go to the Southeast Conference.

01:27.802 --> 01:33.032
So now then, the Southwest Conference, without Arkansas now,

01:33.012 --> 01:34.133
So wondering, what are we going to do?

01:34.173 --> 01:36.256
We're going to die on the vine.

01:36.356 --> 01:37.117
Something's going to happen.

01:37.498 --> 01:41.243
Well, most everybody, I think, just said, well, let's just stay together.

01:41.263 --> 01:41.963
We've got to stay together.

01:41.983 --> 01:43.325
We've been together forever.

01:43.345 --> 01:46.229
But other people were thinking other things.

01:46.249 --> 01:50.474
The University of Texas wasn't going to want to die on the vine, and Texas A&M didn't want to die on the vine.

01:50.554 --> 01:55.581
So the University of Texas was involved in negotiation with the Pac-10.

01:56.682 --> 01:58.024
Texas A&M.

01:58.730 --> 02:04.297
at some level was involved, and all these levels were at board level, not at my level.

02:05.358 --> 02:23.421
And some board members were talking to Southeast Conference people, and so lots of talk, lots of talk, and then finally the legislature's in session, and

02:25.308 --> 02:32.181
Texas A&M and University of Texas presidents go to the governor and say, we're not going anywhere.

02:33.784 --> 02:36.088
We're going to stay where we are.

02:36.108 --> 02:40.736
So everybody bought into that, and so we didn't.

02:40.837 --> 02:43.822
We cooled it for a year and just stayed put.

02:44.523 --> 02:45.966
Then it all boiled up again.

02:47.397 --> 03:01.197
Pac-10 was actively pursuing the University of Texas and Southeast Conference, pursuing Texas A&M and vice versa.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.603
The rest of Southwest Conference was out in the co.

03:06.925 --> 03:15.717
The governor, in her infinite wisdom, called the chancellor of the University of Texas in.

03:17.266 --> 03:18.448
Was he chancellor at that time?

03:18.528 --> 03:19.028
Bill Cunningham.

03:19.048 --> 03:20.250
He called Bill Cunningham in.

03:20.290 --> 03:22.233
Now, was he president or was he chancellor at that time?

03:22.393 --> 03:23.194
We've forgotten.

03:23.214 --> 03:37.873
But she called Bill Cunningham in and said, Mr. President, I don't care where the University of Texas goes, but whatever you all do, you better take care of Texas Tech and Baylor.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.967
Yes, ma'am.

03:41.987 --> 03:52.798
And so then, the University of Texas people called the Pac-10 and said, we can't come unless you'll take Texas Tech.

03:52.818 --> 04:01.346
At the same time, Texas A&M people called the Southeast Conference people and said, we can't come unless you'll take Baylor.

04:03.068 --> 04:04.609
Southeast Conference people said, fine.

04:05.590 --> 04:08.333
Pac-10 Conference people said, no way.

04:10.169 --> 04:15.117
Texas A&M people then called Southeast Conference and said, we can't come unless you'll take Baylor and Texas Tech.

04:15.137 --> 04:17.631
They said, no way.

04:18.893 --> 04:26.242
made that deal where it wasn't gonna work, because nobody was gonna fly in the face of the governor and the Speaker of the House at that time, or?

04:26.742 --> 04:27.423
Lieutenant Governor.

04:27.483 --> 04:28.204
The Lieutenant Governor.

04:28.244 --> 04:29.105
Bob Bullock.

04:29.125 --> 04:29.986
Okay, was it Bullock?

04:30.066 --> 04:31.408
Okay, yes, okay.

04:31.428 --> 04:32.930
So nobody was gonna challenge that.

04:32.950 --> 04:46.926
So that then squelched those two possibilities, which then meant that the only way we were gonna put together a viable conference was North-South.

04:47.429 --> 04:55.578
Were you as the faculty rep and athletic council chairman, were you involved at all in this?

04:55.598 --> 04:56.159
Peripheral.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.582
Did anybody ask you for advice?

04:59.283 --> 05:00.744
President, yeah.

05:02.066 --> 05:17.183
But these negotiations were going on at the present level and there was certainly a lot of politicking going on that I wasn't involved in or even very aware of that picked four out of the

05:17.821 --> 05:21.985
eight Southwest Conference schools to, and that certainly caused turmoil.

05:23.327 --> 05:38.963
And, but it, when it started looking about like it was definitely going to go with the 12 schools and the other four were going to be left out in the cold, about that time the WAC came along and took three and that relieved the pressure there.

05:39.123 --> 05:41.265
So everybody thought everybody was going to come out happy.

05:41.826 --> 05:45.229
Houston wasn't too happy, but of course they were

05:45.547 --> 05:48.270
in the least enviable position of anybody.

05:48.290 --> 05:56.058
They were a dead broke legislator after them for spending money in the wrong way on athletics and all that kind of stuff.

05:56.078 --> 05:59.943
And so they then finally teamed up with Conference USA.

06:00.063 --> 06:02.225
And then everybody seemed as if they were going to be happy.

06:03.226 --> 06:06.029
And I think everybody was happy until the whack fell apart.

06:06.990 --> 06:15.199
And so then from the time the decision was made, then we were involved.

06:16.057 --> 06:19.083
We were involved in writing the rules and the compromises.

06:19.904 --> 06:31.926
We were certainly involved in the academic compromises, but it did take the president of the University of Texas to come in heavy-handedly with the partial qualifier rule to beat down Nebraska on that issue.

06:33.509 --> 06:35.753
But then it finally came around to where

06:36.577 --> 06:42.906
At least 11 of the 12 schools were in agreement on the academic issues.

06:43.186 --> 06:54.341
It was best summed up by the faculty rep from Oklahoma and Dan Gibbons, and some meetings said, look, we have a difference of opinion here.

06:54.361 --> 06:55.462
We need a compromise.

06:55.923 --> 07:04.795
The Southwest Conference doesn't want to admit partial qualifiers, and the eight from the big eight

07:04.775 --> 07:10.763
or split on the issue, so we need a compromise, so letting in a limited number of partial qualifiers is a compromise.

07:11.344 --> 07:12.766
Now, live with it.

07:14.107 --> 07:22.298
And I think that at least got on the surface Nebraska to agree to live with it, although every meeting I'm at I have to fight on that issue.

07:24.241 --> 07:33.533
In hindsight, on all this athletic experience, any opportunities we missed for progress, success,

07:37.023 --> 07:37.904
I don't think so.

07:37.924 --> 07:48.875
There's certainly a lot of things we should have done differently and didn't, but as far as opportunities that missed, I think we've come out as well as we could possibly come out.

07:49.335 --> 07:51.497
I always opposed going with southeast Congress.

07:51.517 --> 07:52.659
Oh, that would have been awful.

07:52.679 --> 07:59.145
I always opposed that and would oppose it to anybody who would listen, but of course nobody was listening to me in those days.

07:59.165 --> 08:02.709
I thought that was a very, very wrong way to go.

08:02.729 --> 08:06.152
I would not have objected academically to the Pac-10

08:06.588 --> 08:09.392
alliance, but they never were very interested in us.

08:09.929 --> 08:22.842
And I argue that the average person that's concerned about going to an A&M game is not very interested in going to a game in Starkville or Auburn or Columbia, South Carolina.

08:23.523 --> 08:23.803
No, no, no.

08:23.823 --> 08:25.745
Or Corvillis or Eugene.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.349
No, no, no, no.

08:29.369 --> 08:29.429
No.

08:29.449 --> 08:29.709
Right, right.

08:29.729 --> 08:36.096
So I think the way it has come out, now then, my first preference would have been to retain the Southwest Conference.

08:36.156 --> 08:37.978
I love the Southwest Conference.

08:37.958 --> 08:45.168
But there was no way that 6% of the television sets were going to survive in a world driven by television.

08:45.889 --> 09:00.530
We had to have a larger fraction of the television sets, and teaming up with the eight teams from the Big Eight has made us a very strong conference.

09:00.550 --> 09:04.135
All right, let's â€“ have we missed any important topics?

09:07.287 --> 09:08.949
I can't think of anything.

09:09.590 --> 09:09.690
Okay.

09:09.711 --> 09:20.346
Let's make believe that you now are the new consultant to Texas A&M's leadership.

09:21.127 --> 09:26.595
What advice would you give them about going from here to the future on whatever topic you want?

09:28.798 --> 09:31.422
Well, I'm very prejudiced.

09:33.747 --> 09:42.360
Our major problems, as I've alluded to in the sciences, certainly in physics, are quality students.

09:43.542 --> 09:53.037
And I'm not sure there's much that can be done about undergraduate students, but graduate students, we are desperately in need of graduate students.

09:53.558 --> 10:01.510
We rank last on most any academic, on most any financial issue that has to do with graduate students.

10:01.777 --> 10:03.400
You mean in compensation and so forth?

10:03.420 --> 10:05.444
Compensation, yeah.

10:05.464 --> 10:09.632
Almost all of our competing universities waive tuitions for graduate students.

10:10.313 --> 10:11.596
We don't.

10:11.616 --> 10:18.469
Almost all of our competing institutions pay a higher stipend to the graduate students than we do.

10:19.782 --> 10:25.051
And we plead this case time and time again, and nobody's interested.

10:26.855 --> 10:31.844
I think it's because the college, I think this is a problem unique to the College of Science.

10:31.864 --> 10:38.335
I think College of Business, College of Liberal Arts, Education, I think they're getting all the graduate students they want.

10:39.037 --> 10:43.765
Their stipends, competitive or not competitive, they're getting what they want.

10:43.745 --> 10:47.831
Engineering, they don't even give stipends to their first-year graduate students.

10:47.851 --> 10:49.674
A lot of our graduate students come over here.

10:50.555 --> 10:52.398
We hire them for a year and then they're gone over to there.

10:53.760 --> 11:00.910
And so we need, in the sciences, we desperately need help to be competitive

11:00.890 --> 11:04.295
for graduate students, for top quality graduate students.

11:05.117 --> 11:08.462
But that's sort of a narrow, selfish view.

11:09.363 --> 11:10.144
Any other advice?

11:10.805 --> 11:11.246
Pardon?

11:11.266 --> 11:12.828
Any other advice to the leadership?

11:13.690 --> 11:15.192
I think admissions.

11:15.873 --> 11:18.277
I would love to see admissions reworked.

11:18.337 --> 11:22.223
I don't think high school grades

11:22.203 --> 11:26.389
and SAT scores are going to give us the type student I want to see here.

11:27.551 --> 11:30.335
How large could the enrollment be though?

11:30.355 --> 11:32.098
How many more students can we accommodate?

11:32.418 --> 11:33.480
That's my point though.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.203
I'd like to throw them out the back door.

11:35.783 --> 11:39.128
I think we're letting a lot of them stay that should not stay.

11:40.070 --> 11:42.894
And so I would open that back door.

11:42.914 --> 11:46.059
I want to let them in and give them a chance.

11:46.660 --> 11:49.043
I would like to see that go to the college level too.

11:49.144 --> 11:50.826
The colleges now are

11:50.806 --> 11:54.311
going to 2.5 GPA or we won't talk to you.

11:54.992 --> 11:57.315
I'd like to see some exceptions.

11:57.335 --> 12:06.587
Let those associate deans make some decisions not based on grades but based on the attitude, the background of the kid.

12:06.667 --> 12:10.512
Let them in the door and tell them they're out the next year if they don't perform.

12:11.213 --> 12:13.116
Right now you can't get in the door.

12:13.136 --> 12:17.742
I think that's a mistake.

12:19.274 --> 12:26.185
Dr. Williams said, rank in class is the best way to judge success in college.

12:26.546 --> 12:30.252
I haven't seen anything since those days that convinced me he was wrong.

12:31.093 --> 12:32.455
I think that's right.

12:32.535 --> 12:38.565
If you're going to fight your way to the top of your class, even if it's a mediocre class, that tells me something

12:39.271 --> 12:45.280
So you're not talking to someone who's opposed to this legislative 10% rule that a lot of people are fighting about.

12:46.201 --> 12:56.036
I think we need a program here for, maybe I can't say weaker students, but I think we need programs for students who are less sophisticated in math.

12:56.056 --> 13:04.969
There are very few programs at Texas A&M where you can go in and perform unless you have a sophistication in math that's higher.

13:04.989 --> 13:09.075
You look at the University of Texas, they have programs where they can put students who

13:09.055 --> 13:17.107
I couldn't compete in a world that requires some reasonable mathematics from my standpoint.

13:17.127 --> 13:18.610
You look at all the schools.

13:20.352 --> 13:28.405
It's difficult when I make such statements because I get accused of being this way because of athletics, and I'm not.

13:28.625 --> 13:29.066
I am not.

13:29.747 --> 13:36.497
It certainly would benefit the athletic program if there were some less sophisticated programs.

13:36.477 --> 13:46.833
But there are a number of academic things that I just flat disagree with the majority of our faculty on.

13:46.853 --> 13:52.682
The first one was doing away with exemption for finals for seniors.

13:52.702 --> 13:55.567
That was a Vandiver mistake also.

13:55.587 --> 13:57.570
Well, no, that was a faculty senate mistake.

13:57.750 --> 13:58.131
Oh, was it?

13:58.331 --> 13:58.632
Oh.

13:58.652 --> 14:00.715
That was the first action of our faculty senate.

14:00.735 --> 14:01.015
Oh, really?

14:01.777 --> 14:01.837
Oh.

14:01.857 --> 14:04.020
Led by Murray Milford.

14:04.000 --> 14:04.621
Really?

14:04.681 --> 14:06.023
Which really surprised me.

14:06.043 --> 14:06.685
I didn't know that.

14:06.945 --> 14:08.187
Really surprised me.

14:08.207 --> 14:14.057
My position was we usually have them for 10 sets of final exams, so what if they miss 10 percent?

14:14.077 --> 14:15.359
That's right.

14:15.379 --> 14:21.570
And how many people change their semester grade on a final exam very much?

14:21.550 --> 14:22.611
So I oppose that.

14:23.212 --> 14:29.818
I am very, very opposed to not replacing a lower grade when you take the course over again.

14:29.839 --> 14:40.249
You make an F or a D, you come back and make a B, along with this guy over here who had never taken it before and made a B. Why don't you deserve a B, and let's forget about that D that you made?

14:40.910 --> 14:43.392
But you can't convince this faculty to get rid of that.

14:43.412 --> 14:49.819
Whereas the universities around the country, some very, very classy universities around the country, operate that way.

14:49.799 --> 15:03.764
If someone walked up to you and gave you a check for a million dollars with one requirement, that it be passed on to Texas A&M and you decide the use to be made of your gift.

15:04.987 --> 15:05.808
You know the answer to this.

15:06.029 --> 15:06.549
What would it be?

15:07.251 --> 15:09.996
Stipends for graduate students in science.

15:10.016 --> 15:10.216
Okay.

15:10.817 --> 15:12.921
That's part of my complaint.

15:12.901 --> 15:26.593
We go in front of the provost and the president annually, and we talk about our major problem in the College of Science, stipends for graduate students, and faculty salaries too.

15:26.693 --> 15:33.159
But physics faculty are paid at 87% of competing peer institutions.

15:33.179 --> 15:42.908
But stipends are of more concern than faculty salaries, because without the graduate students, we don't have a graduate program in physics.

15:45.082 --> 15:58.821
Every meeting we have, we go over these things, stipend, stipend.

15:59.020 --> 16:05.730
eventually evolves to what we're going to do with extra money, like the new $17 million, $20 million we're getting because of the change in the law.

16:06.672 --> 16:12.581
And we immediately start talking about endowed chairs, endowed fellowships, and things like this.

16:13.622 --> 16:26.682
And so the priorities don't include something that is basic to our program, the very foundation of our program, and that's graduate students, good, solid graduate students.

16:28.973 --> 16:34.839
I had forgotten that you were an A&M undergraduate, or I might have done your student days first.

16:34.859 --> 16:35.660
We'll do that later.

16:37.042 --> 16:38.103
Next, the last question.

16:38.583 --> 16:46.211
What did you learn at Texas A&M while you were a student that has made a difference in your life?

16:46.231 --> 16:49.495
What has it, having been an Aggie?

16:51.417 --> 16:57.343
Oh, I'm sure that, well, I think

16:58.538 --> 17:15.464
The leadership work within the Corps of Cadets that I was involved in, I think that certainly shaped the way I look at things and do things.

17:16.827 --> 17:20.272
So that was a positive experience.

17:20.392 --> 17:25.440
I am fairly critical of that organization now.

17:25.825 --> 17:39.160
I think in those days it served a good purpose and that was the only

17:40.844 --> 17:47.254
outside classroom learning experience you could have at this university in those days.

17:47.274 --> 17:53.263
Nowadays, there are many more opportunities for expanding your horizons beyond the classroom.

17:55.105 --> 17:58.490
So that was important.

18:04.219 --> 18:05.381
Last question.

18:05.401 --> 18:08.185
What feelings do you hold in your heart for Texas A&M today?

18:09.464 --> 18:13.209
Oh, I'm certainly very fond of the place.

18:13.609 --> 18:19.216
It's been my life for 30-some odd years.

18:22.900 --> 18:28.467
But I think that I live so close to it, I see the warts.

18:28.828 --> 18:36.417
It's much more pleasant, I think, for my buddies who don't live here in town and don't see

18:37.747 --> 18:39.571
all of the things.

18:39.631 --> 18:42.036
I think it's like anything else.

18:42.056 --> 18:44.902
There's so many positives and so many negatives.

18:44.922 --> 18:48.610
You've got to keep telling yourself, let's just focus on the positives.

18:48.690 --> 18:54.102
We've got so many positives around here, but I'm afraid I'm like, I'll never, you taught me a very important lesson.

18:55.634 --> 19:02.642
You'll never remember this, but I was just absolutely astounded at your criticism.

19:03.923 --> 19:06.086
And then it dawned on me, well, that's our job.

19:06.106 --> 19:06.907
We're faculty.

19:06.927 --> 19:08.529
We don't look for the positives.

19:08.549 --> 19:09.570
We look for the negatives.

19:10.371 --> 19:16.398
But you and somebody else and I walked through Kane Hall when it first opened.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.705
And I was, yeah, I was brand new in the job up there.

19:24.288 --> 19:34.244
And you and the other person, I forgot who it was, were very critical of all the little details in this building.

19:34.725 --> 19:36.070
And that stuck in my mind.

19:37.366 --> 19:39.370
And I thought, geez, this beautiful dorm.

19:39.390 --> 19:45.120
And I lived in that dump across campus that's still a dump, as a matter of fact.

19:45.941 --> 19:52.073
And this beautiful temple here, these people are picking the pieces.

19:52.093 --> 19:53.796
Okay, so that sunk in.

19:53.816 --> 19:58.925
And then the next year, see it opened.

19:58.945 --> 20:01.770
Barb Sears, one of the first students to live in that dorm.

20:01.750 --> 20:10.662
And she and another group from that dorm came to see me as assistant to the president to complain about the dorm.

20:10.683 --> 20:14.668
And their complaints were just, to me, completely trivial.

20:14.969 --> 20:22.459
Here they're living in this beautiful, beautiful place and they're complaining because the carpeting doesn't go all the way in the hallway.

20:22.810 --> 20:25.096
They're complaining because the windows are too narrow?

20:25.317 --> 20:26.059
They're complaining?

20:26.540 --> 20:27.222
I mean, I just was.

20:27.844 --> 20:32.978
So, the same thing here.

20:34.482 --> 20:38.794
We've got tons of positive things around here, but I'm surrounded by faculty.

20:38.774 --> 20:42.200
who pick at the negatives, and we have plenty of those.

20:43.863 --> 20:54.161
But it's a great university, and it's certainly been good to me, and I love the place and all that, but I have worked hard not to let losing football games bother me.

20:55.984 --> 20:56.665
Let's quit on that.
