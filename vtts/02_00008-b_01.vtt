00:01.930 --> 00:32.260
About

00:01.930 --> 00:32.260
how many times did you go home during the academic 
year? How many

00:32.240 --> 01:11.650
times did you

00:32.240 --> 01:11.650
go home

00:32.240 --> 01:11.650
during the academic

00:32.240 --> 01:11.650
year?

01:11.630 --> 01:25.100
How

01:11.630 --> 01:25.100
many

01:11.630 --> 01:25.100
times

01:11.630 --> 01:25.100
did you go home during the academic year? 58 How 
many times did you go home during the academic

01:25.080 --> 01:33.580
year? Hellah

01:33.560 --> 02:01.780
Heail

02:01.760 --> 02:14.030
88

02:01.760 --> 02:14.030
By that time, I was doing, I was a brother, so I was a 
little bit younger, about four. So I traveled back

02:14.010 --> 02:22.600
and forth, I guess, maybe 15 or 20 times as a senior. 
Let's see, we were doing the Y. All right, Guyon

02:25.173 --> 02:26.942
Hall. What did Guyon Hall, what did it, what role 
did it play? Well, very little to an interview,

02:30.580 --> 02:35.580
because that's the place where you got your 
diploma. Did you go to a movie over there, or a

02:35.560 --> 02:40.600
speech? How

02:40.580 --> 02:52.610
often did you

02:40.580 --> 02:52.610
go to a movie? It

02:52.590 --> 03:00.010
cost money. All right, let's go then on, let's say 
it's Saturday night. What would you and your

03:06.190 --> 03:15.210
buddies do for a good time on a Saturday night if 
there's not a football weekend or anything like

03:06.190 --> 03:15.210
that? I'd

03:15.190 --> 03:32.300
shoot in the bowl.

03:32.280 --> 03:39.790
Where would you go to do that,

03:32.280 --> 03:39.790
really? You'd just walk, just take a walk. And 
after softball, of course, it'd be Saturday

03:43.050 --> 03:47.690
night. I'd shoot in the bowl. I'd shoot in the bowl. 
I'd shoot in the bowl. So

03:52.520 --> 04:03.790
you seldom ate off campus for fun, just to go eat 
somewhere. Okay. I

04:05.736 --> 04:16.670
really don't

04:05.736 --> 04:16.670
went to home. I've heard of Hard Liquor's, where 
was Hard Liquor's?

04:44.040 --> 04:45.061
The Whiskey Bridge. Did, now

04:45.040 --> 05:11.240
somebody

04:45.040 --> 05:11.240
mentioned to me running wood and water, and I've 
never found anybody, somebody said, ask them

05:13.440 --> 05:15.460
about that one. And I've not heard. Running wood 
and water. Yeah. What about Uncle Ed's? Was it, was

05:19.440 --> 05:21.460
Hard Liquor's Uncle Ed's? Yeah. Was that a 
respectable place? Or if you went to Hard

05:27.090 --> 05:31.770
Liquor's, would you not admit it? Oh, you would. 
Okay, to your buddies. Okay. All right. All right,

05:39.260 --> 05:40.281
describe what was. You wouldn't tell your 
professors that you did. Describe what was at

05:42.260 --> 05:46.650
Northgate when you were a freshman. I mean, when 
you were an undergraduate. Well. What was over

05:49.671 --> 05:50.650
there? On

05:50.630 --> 05:54.460
the corner. On the corner?

06:16.480 --> 06:16.703
Yeah. Campus Theater. Was there a theater there 
then?

06:25.010 --> 06:31.020
Was there anything at Southgate?

06:31.000 --> 06:31.983
Eastgate? If

06:33.509 --> 06:42.680
you came or went on the bus, you got off there. Yeah. 
The railroad station.

06:58.100 --> 07:02.120
All right, describe the routine of an Aggie 
hitchhiking. When

07:02.100 --> 07:37.840
you got there, you had

07:02.100 --> 07:37.840
your

07:02.100 --> 07:37.840
place. And then you had to use good judgment. Some 
kind of truck would come by and say, go into

07:42.390 --> 07:43.411
Navasola.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.501
Or closer to Houston. Or all the way to Houston. 
It's amazing. Almost everyone would come by there

07:49.697 --> 07:50.650
to see you. And you never had an incident or a 
problem?

08:12.480 --> 08:18.230
Do you remember any unusual characters? Any 
unusual characters that gave you a ride? Yeah.

08:27.625 --> 08:28.470
You know, they'd take them down to B-Down. They

08:29.450 --> 08:50.460
were trained to the whole deal. So they all took a 
spot where they wanted to. But I didn't have any

08:51.440 --> 08:52.461
money. Did you ever ride? Then I did. I did. I did. I 
did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I

09:05.760 --> 09:07.948
did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I 
did. I did. That's something. It's just like one of

09:17.993 --> 09:19.340
those videos that letzte to all society. A 
message. And is it going to get any better? Yes.

09:21.816 --> 09:23.530
What do you get at the end, G lettuce? We get better 
demands. Yeah. Yeah. You see, I saw that . You know,

09:29.920 --> 09:30.961
college station that you . What is it? I went to a 
brown road college station. And that is a pretty

09:32.940 --> 09:33.961
popular place. And then down were do and . Wow, 
those wereي ...

09:40.489 --> 09:48.530
He had

09:40.489 --> 09:48.530
a convention somewhere in that area, had a car full 
and the guy was trippin, There

09:48.510 --> 09:57.005
was a car full of them driving, funding to drive a 
car. See, I remember those. They apparently had

10:00.291 --> 10:05.040
more funding than they should have. They couldn't 
make a fine with these people who were right or

10:05.020 --> 10:12.027
left, so they went right at us. And you talk about 
Aggie's there now. We all managed to get out of the

10:15.520 --> 10:25.173
way. He ran that thing up

10:26.776 --> 10:40.014
there,

10:26.776 --> 10:40.014
a bunch of bushes. Got in high center. And they got 
out there and they were stupid. And we remember

10:44.400 --> 10:48.038
those. But finally, we all got together and we set 
his car back on the road. It was a pretty strange

10:52.340 --> 10:57.586
experience to see this car from the right. We 
thought he turned right or left, but he came

10:57.908 --> 11:00.360
straight on. Uh,

11:00.340 --> 11:05.950
it's important personality. Were there any 
celebrities that visited the campus while you

11:05.930 --> 11:08.602
were a student? Were there any famous people? 
Entertainers? Politicians? Government?

11:12.499 --> 11:13.062
Generals? Anybody? That's

11:14.930 --> 11:27.928
an impression on me. You know, we didn't have the 
student government there. We didn't have a place

11:33.375 --> 11:36.660
for them to come to entertain. There was a general 
out of the Office of Chief Engineers. Came. And

11:46.924 --> 11:56.110
they went there by their ... some kind of review of 
the military, which is the only thing that they

11:46.924 --> 11:56.110
did. Mm-hmm.

11:59.916 --> 12:00.540
And I don't remember his name. Religious 
activities on the campus. What were they and where

12:02.697 --> 12:04.653
were they? On or around? Most of

12:05.520 --> 12:12.659
them. Most of them. Did you and your buddies go to 
church on Sunday? Or go to chapel? I usually ...

12:23.740 --> 12:24.852
What did you do on Sunday morning? Sleep late? Try

12:27.340 --> 12:34.640
to step off the list. was the what happened there

12:34.620 --> 13:01.150
describe about an Aggie basketball game

12:34.620 --> 13:01.150
did y'all go to the games all right then let's talk 
about important football tell me about Aggie

13:01.130 --> 13:25.060
football in the late 30s

13:01.130 --> 13:25.060
who

13:25.040 --> 13:34.620
who were the favorites as human beings among those 
football stars who did who did y'all like best as a

13:34.600 --> 14:00.790
person

13:34.600 --> 14:00.790
Marshall that

13:34.600 --> 14:00.790
where was was Marion Pew from he wasn't a native of I 
know he would live there afterward and

14:00.770 --> 14:23.760
the coach tell me about him oh you really

14:00.770 --> 14:23.760
court trips describe a court trip during

14:23.740 --> 14:46.420
your

15:02.480 --> 15:14.460
now

15:02.480 --> 15:14.460
how did you get up there back

15:19.490 --> 15:31.000
so it'd be Dallas and Fort Worth and alternate 
years in Austin and Houston

15:19.490 --> 15:31.000
do you remember any court trip events 
particularly snafus,

15:35.160 --> 15:41.680
jokes, big events? Engineer

15:41.660 --> 16:00.516
events.

16:09.183 --> 16:28.800
My junior year,

16:09.183 --> 16:28.800
Rice

16:09.183 --> 16:28.800
left something to no one else. So they were very 
concerned when we came back, not seeing any other

16:34.480 --> 16:36.500
thing. And then they retaliated, and they kept us. 
So,

16:40.040 --> 16:44.120
we had no more of that. And they worked without me, 
and

16:46.100 --> 16:51.310
they probably promised. They were concerned that 
we would get aid, and so

16:55.730 --> 17:08.280
we went down there Friday afternoon. We go up to the 
big campus. The kids just couldn't care less about

17:12.240 --> 17:17.440
the administration. They just hated it. Right 
there, we were on the campus. We were all over the

17:22.420 --> 17:24.440
building, you know. Here were Aggies standing? 
Yeah, all seniors and boots. We were, it must have

17:28.920 --> 17:30.940
been about No,

17:30.920 --> 17:35.820
not that they were there. Rice, he was just hated 
it. He hated the fact that we were only policing

17:40.800 --> 17:43.580
their campus for them. How did an Aggie get a date 
for a court trip weekend? There

17:49.560 --> 17:55.690
were many different ways. Of

17:55.670 --> 18:20.780
course,

17:55.670 --> 18:20.780
the Dallas,

17:55.670 --> 18:20.780
I guess,

18:20.760 --> 18:22.780
two-thirds of the dates were blind dates. And some 
of them were real blind, too. Did y'all have

18:24.760 --> 18:28.800
nicknames for an ugly date? Were

18:28.780 --> 18:34.790
there moose pots? Yeah. Describe that.

18:41.440 --> 18:45.460
I've heard that you and your buddies would all chip 
in and whoever had the worst date got the money.

18:50.440 --> 18:54.980
That sounds like a good idea. There always was a 
worse date. Are there any blind date experiences

18:57.960 --> 19:02.980
you had that you can share? Let's

19:02.960 --> 19:24.460
go then to a football game day in College Station. 
Take me through the whole day. Either

19:26.440 --> 19:29.834
way. Well, let's do both. My mom

19:33.750 --> 20:45.550
would dance. There

20:45.530 --> 20:51.960
was some type of dance. Maybe.

20:58.523 --> 21:03.180
Describe the conduct of people at a dance. Where 
was it held and how did people act? Such

21:06.160 --> 21:20.210
as?

21:21.511 --> 21:47.550
How

21:21.511 --> 21:47.550
did people? More slow music. And

21:49.530 --> 21:58.260
how did the young men and women dress for the dance? 
And what would they wear?

22:05.180 --> 22:11.500
And did they behave well?

22:11.480 --> 22:17.943
Alcohol.

22:20.151 --> 22:22.700
Do you remember anybody getting drunk? Because

22:22.680 --> 22:31.310
what I've heard, things seem comparatively 
orderly. Let's see. All right. During the game,

22:35.570 --> 22:38.590
where did you fish sit? Or where did y'all stand 
during football? If we had dates, then

22:45.090 --> 23:07.370
they'd

22:45.090 --> 23:07.370
want you to stand right in the mud. Did y'all, was 
there a pass by before the game? Did y'all march in

23:12.370 --> 23:14.390
by units? During

23:14.370 --> 23:27.050
your, particularly your junior and senior year, 
y'all won a lot of games. What happened at the end of

23:28.030 --> 23:32.050
a game that y'all won on campus? Now, who was to 
capture the young leaders and throw them? Were

23:43.660 --> 23:49.260
there yells, were the same yells given then as now? 
And has much changed during the game? The

23:52.240 --> 23:58.810
band and so forth that you remember? Did y'all 
respect, you students not in the band, did

24:01.790 --> 24:18.970
y'all

24:01.790 --> 24:18.970
respect the band? There were some of them. Other

24:20.950 --> 24:40.220
student

24:20.950 --> 24:40.220
organizations of prestige other than the band? 
What were those local clubs, what did they do? They

24:43.200 --> 24:57.350
were just, they

24:43.200 --> 24:57.350
were just, they were just, they were just, But 
other

24:59.330 --> 25:15.920
local clubs, what did

24:59.330 --> 25:15.920
they do?

25:18.120 --> 25:20.140
We were just...

25:31.980 --> 25:40.850
Would this be for, just for that group primarily? 
Well… This would be at college station? No,

25:44.830 --> 25:59.490
they went back,

25:44.830 --> 25:59.490
back in the college station,

26:02.970 --> 26:04.990
It would be Jim, wishing quickly we'd be there, was 
that was that place to go to get help and with

26:04.970 --> 26:19.020
homework and

26:04.970 --> 26:19.020
maybe a ride home occasionally let's

26:19.000 --> 26:38.810
see other student-organized singing cadets were 
they all

26:38.790 --> 27:07.780
right

26:38.790 --> 27:07.780
so intramurals were important and

26:38.790 --> 27:07.780
they were by core outfit what

27:07.760 --> 27:44.380
sports were included

27:07.760 --> 27:44.380
touch touch foot touch football

27:07.760 --> 27:44.380
swimming waterfall

27:44.360 --> 28:05.360
muster do you remember muster when you were a 
student what about final review

28:05.340 --> 28:39.440
describe it

28:05.340 --> 28:39.440
held

28:05.340 --> 28:39.440
MSC on the drill feeler right now so final review 
for you is held in the spring of 1941 what did you and

28:43.520 --> 29:00.490
your classmates think was ahead for you

28:43.520 --> 29:00.490
did y'all grant in the dormitories did y'all talk 
much about what was going on in Europe did y'all

29:10.120 --> 29:29.980
anticipate

29:10.120 --> 29:29.980
so

29:10.120 --> 29:29.980
you didn't you weren't assuming that the US would 
certainly be in

29:29.960 --> 29:52.370
the war

29:29.960 --> 29:52.370
let's see remember any world events that caught 
your attention while you were student I kept

29:59.210 --> 30:32.410
up with the seeing

29:59.210 --> 30:32.410
how this one

29:59.210 --> 30:32.410
did you and your fellow students assume that if we 
had a problem it would be in Europe or in the Far East

30:32.390 --> 30:46.940
see I

30:32.390 --> 30:46.940
tell I tell students that people of our age once we 
get to December 7th we remember where we were when

30:54.160 --> 30:56.240
we heard that news Franklin Roosevelt's death and 
so forth but I can't think of any event that would

31:03.280 --> 31:10.260
have caused you and your folk and your fellow 
students before the spring of 41 I can't think of

31:10.240 --> 31:16.040
any thing that would stop you in your tracks like 
the Germans invading Poland no that they wouldn't

31:16.020 --> 31:19.760
know there wouldn't have been an interruption of 
every radio station

31:19.740 --> 31:27.070
let's see what a the biggest effect of the
