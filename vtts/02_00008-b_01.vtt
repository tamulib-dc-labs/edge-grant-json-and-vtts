00:01.930 --> 00:32.260
About

00:01.930 --> 00:32.260
how many times did you go home during the academic 
year? How many

00:32.240 --> 01:11.650
times did you

00:32.240 --> 01:11.650
go home

00:32.240 --> 01:11.650
during the academic

00:32.240 --> 01:11.650
year?

01:11.630 --> 01:25.100
How

01:11.630 --> 01:25.100
many

01:11.630 --> 01:25.100
times

01:11.630 --> 01:25.100
did you go home during the academic year? How many 
times

01:25.080 --> 01:46.440
did you

01:25.080 --> 01:46.440
go home during the academic

01:25.080 --> 01:46.440
year? How

01:46.420 --> 02:03.780
many times did

01:46.420 --> 02:03.780
you go home during the academic year? So

02:03.760 --> 02:18.030
I traveled

02:03.760 --> 02:18.030
back and forth, I guess, maybe 15 or 20 times. 
Senior. Senior. Let's see, we were doing the Y. All

02:24.872 --> 02:26.600
right, Guyon Hall. What did Guyon Hall, what did 
it, what role did it play? Well, very little.

02:32.580 --> 02:35.580
That's the place where you got your diploma. Did 
you go to a movie over there or a speech? How

02:40.580 --> 02:52.610
often did you

02:40.580 --> 02:52.610
go to a movie? It

02:52.590 --> 03:00.010
cost money. All right, let's go then on, let's say 
it's Saturday night. What would you and your

03:06.190 --> 03:11.210
buddies do for a good time on a Saturday night if 
there's not a football weekend or anything like

03:11.190 --> 03:15.210
that? Where

03:15.190 --> 03:39.790
would

03:15.190 --> 03:39.790
you go to do that,

03:15.190 --> 03:39.790
really? You'd just walk, just take a walk. And 
after sophomore, of course, it'd be Saturday

03:43.050 --> 03:47.690
night. I mean, we had one freshman who started back 
in the day at a whiskey bar. Right. So you seldom ate

03:58.555 --> 04:03.790
off-campus for fun, just to go eat somewhere. 
Okay. I

04:05.736 --> 04:16.670
really don't

04:05.736 --> 04:16.670
went for a walk. I've heard of Hard Liquors. Where 
was Hard Liquors? The

04:21.930 --> 04:44.060
Whiskey

04:21.930 --> 04:44.060
Bridge.

04:44.040 --> 04:44.381
Yeah.

04:56.678 --> 04:57.320
Did. I didn't go. Now

04:58.300 --> 05:12.240
somebody

04:58.300 --> 05:12.240
mentioned to me running wood and water, and I've 
never found anybody who somebody said, ask them

05:12.220 --> 05:16.141
about that one. And I've not heard of it. What about 
Uncle Ed's? Was it, was Hard Liquor's Uncle Ed's?

05:23.771 --> 05:26.699
Was that a respectable place? Or if you went to Hard 
Liquor's would you not admit it? Oh you, okay, to

05:33.176 --> 05:36.466
your buddies. Okay, all right. Describe what, 
what was,

05:39.795 --> 05:44.970
describe what was at Northgate when you were a 
freshman. I mean, when you were an undergraduate.

05:49.707 --> 05:50.150
What was over there?

05:54.094 --> 05:54.595
On the corner. Campus

05:56.197 --> 06:17.360
Theater.

06:19.122 --> 06:24.548
Was there a theater there

06:19.122 --> 06:24.548
then? Was there anything at Southgate? Eastgate?

06:33.497 --> 06:42.585
If

06:33.497 --> 06:42.585
you came or went on the bus, you got off there.

06:45.327 --> 06:46.428
The railroad station.

06:55.617 --> 06:59.500
Describe

06:55.617 --> 06:59.500
the routine of an Aggie hitchhiking.

07:42.890 --> 07:46.738
going to Navasola. Then you have to decide whether 
you want to go to Navasola, or you want to stay

07:46.758 --> 08:01.330
there, and maybe get a ride that will take you 
closer to Halstead, or closer to Houston, or all

07:46.758 --> 08:01.330
the way to Houston. It's

08:01.310 --> 08:06.017
amazing. Almost everyone would come by there to 
see me. And

08:08.310 --> 08:17.277
you've never had an incident or a problem. Do you 
remember any unusual characters that gave you a

08:17.297 --> 08:21.730
ride? Yes.

08:35.322 --> 08:56.960
You

08:35.322 --> 08:56.960
know,

08:35.322 --> 08:56.960
they'd take me down to Baton Rouge, and they were 
intrigued with the aqua and the pollution, and

08:35.322 --> 08:56.960
they were intrigued with the whole deal. So,

08:56.940 --> 09:03.280
they all took responsibility for it. You know, but 
I didn't have any money. So, that's it. I missed one

09:08.570 --> 09:11.640
last great opportunity, I guess. Did you ever 
ride? Then I, then I, I remember one thing very

09:14.100 --> 09:19.840
much. You're talking about a site I do at Y at 
Halstead. It's in the college station where you Y

09:25.010 --> 09:28.440
off to a ground road. College station. And that is a 
pretty popular place. And see, at that point, I had

09:32.440 --> 09:35.460
to go to a ground road. And then down to LaGrange, 
and that was for Lyons. Lyons. And they

09:41.888 --> 09:48.310
had a convention somewhere in that area. There

09:48.290 --> 09:53.630
was a car full of them. They were driving, funding 
to drive a car. See? I remember those. They

09:59.210 --> 10:04.350
apparently had more fun than they should have. 
They couldn't make me fly with them. They were

10:09.300 --> 10:10.321
right or left. So, they went right at us. And you 
talk about Aggie favor now. We all, we all managed

10:15.300 --> 10:18.340
to get out of the way. He ran that thing up there, a 
bunch of bushes. Got in the high center. And they

10:25.420 --> 10:28.040
got out there. And they were stupid. They

10:29.020 --> 10:46.600
don't remember any of those.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.600
But finally, we all got together. We sat in the car 
back on the road. We were going down. It was a pretty

10:53.120 --> 10:56.140
strange experience to see this. They thought he 
turned right or left, but he came straight on.

11:00.120 --> 11:08.730
Important

11:00.120 --> 11:08.730
personalities that visited the campus while you 
were a student. Were there any famous people?

11:09.710 --> 11:10.894
Entertainers? Politicians? Government? 
Generals? Anybody?

11:24.983 --> 11:27.350
But that's an impression on me. Okay. Go ahead. You 
know, we didn't have the student government deal.

11:31.420 --> 11:38.440
We didn't have the entertaining place for them to 
come to entertain. There was a, there was a, that's

11:38.420 --> 11:46.440
a, a general out of the Office of Chief Engineers 
came by there with some type of a review of the

11:46.420 --> 11:50.440
military. What's his name? Not really an out of the 
Office of Chief Engineers. But it's one of the

11:54.870 --> 11:55.891
things that they did. I don't remember his name. 
Uh,

11:56.870 --> 12:03.320
religious activities on the campus. What were 
they and where were they? On or around? Most of

12:06.300 --> 12:07.321
them. Most

12:07.300 --> 12:13.720
of them. Did you and your buddies go to church on 
Sunday? Or go to chapel? I usually, I usually...

12:19.140 --> 12:23.540
What'd you do on Sunday morning? Sleep late? Try to 
step off of the roof. Do where? Field House was the,

12:26.569 --> 12:28.140
uh, what happened there? Describe an Aggie 
basketball game. The Aggie basketball game. what

12:35.400 --> 13:03.970
happened there

12:35.400 --> 13:03.970
describe about an Aggie basketball game

12:35.400 --> 13:03.970
did y'all go to the games all right then let's talk 
about important football tell me about Aggie

13:03.950 --> 13:25.080
football in the late 30s

13:03.950 --> 13:25.080
who

13:25.060 --> 13:34.320
who were the favorites as human beings among those 
football stars who didn't who did y'all like best

13:34.300 --> 14:00.790
as a person

13:34.300 --> 14:00.790
Marshall where

13:34.300 --> 14:00.790
was was Marion Pugh from he wasn't a native of I know 
he would live there afterward and

14:00.770 --> 14:23.760
the coach tell me about him oh you really

14:00.770 --> 14:23.760
court trips describe a court trip during

14:23.740 --> 14:46.420
your

15:02.180 --> 15:14.440
how

15:02.180 --> 15:14.440
did you get up there back so

15:14.420 --> 15:27.480
it'd be Dallas and Fort Worth in alternate years 
and Austin and Houston do you remember any court

15:27.460 --> 15:34.780
trip events particularly snafus

15:34.860 --> 16:25.810
jokes big events

16:25.790 --> 16:28.457
nothing another to annoy us. So they were very 
concerned when we came back to see the other baby.

16:36.900 --> 16:45.075
And then they were tallying in the campus. So we 
told them that they weren't without us.

17:05.815 --> 17:07.639
They were concerned that we would get an insult. We 
went down there Friday afternoon. We go up to the

17:08.360 --> 17:11.916
big campus. The kids just couldn't care less about 
the administration. They just hated it. Right

17:21.080 --> 17:24.540
there, we were on the campus. Here were Aggies 
standing? Yeah, old seniors and boots. There must

17:29.020 --> 17:31.040
have been about six to seven of them. No,

17:31.020 --> 17:37.312
not that they were there. The rice dealers just 
hated it. The fact that we were on that police and

17:38.900 --> 17:43.680
their campers' farm. How did an Aggie get a date for 
a court trip weekend?

17:52.430 --> 18:01.599
There were many different

17:52.430 --> 18:01.599
ways. Of course,

18:02.760 --> 18:22.880
the Dallas,

18:02.760 --> 18:22.880
I guess two-thirds of the days were blind dates. 
And some of them were real blind, too. Did y'all

18:24.860 --> 18:28.992
have nicknames for an ugly date?

18:33.947 --> 18:34.890
Were there moose pots? Yeah. Describe that. I've

18:37.790 --> 18:50.560
heard that you and your buddies would all chip in 
and whoever had the worst date got the money. That

18:50.540 --> 18:55.080
sounds like a good idea. There always was a worst 
date. Are there any blind date experiences you had

18:58.060 --> 19:03.080
that you can share? Let's

19:03.060 --> 19:24.522
go then to a football game day in College Station. 
Take me through the whole day.

19:31.850 --> 19:32.891
Either way. Well. Let's do both. My mom

19:34.850 --> 20:58.280
would

19:34.850 --> 20:58.280
die

19:34.850 --> 20:58.280
in

19:34.850 --> 20:58.280
some

19:34.850 --> 20:58.280
type

19:34.850 --> 20:58.280
of

19:34.850 --> 20:58.280
dance.

20:58.260 --> 21:03.703
Describe the conduct of people at a dance. Where 
was it held and how did people act

21:03.723 --> 21:45.650
such as?

21:45.630 --> 21:47.650
How did people... More slow music. And

21:49.630 --> 21:57.360
how did y'all, did the men, young men and women 
dress for the dance? Well. And what would they

21:59.967 --> 22:00.789
wear?

22:05.902 --> 22:12.600
And did they behave well?

22:12.580 --> 22:17.941
Alcohol.

22:20.150 --> 22:22.800
Do you remember anybody getting drunk that day? 
Because

22:22.780 --> 22:31.410
what I've heard, things seem comparatively 
orderly. Let's see. All right. During the game,

22:34.670 --> 22:38.146
where did you fish sit? Or where did y'all stand 
during football? If we had dates,

22:43.190 --> 23:08.490
then

22:43.190 --> 23:08.490
they'd want you to stand right in the mud. Did 
y'all, was there a pass by before the game? Did

23:13.041 --> 23:25.150
y'all march in by units?

23:25.130 --> 23:28.656
During your, particularly your junior and senior 
year, y'all won a lot of games. What happened at the

23:28.716 --> 23:41.780
end of a game that y'all won on campus?

23:41.760 --> 23:44.780
Now who was to capture the yell leaders and throw 
them in the pond? Were

23:44.760 --> 23:52.360
there yells, were the same yells given then as now? 
And

23:52.340 --> 24:00.910
has much changed during the game, the band and so 
forth, that you remember? Did

24:00.890 --> 24:22.070
y'all respect, you students not in the band, did 
y'all respect the band? There

24:22.050 --> 24:27.590
was some in, some of them. Other

24:27.570 --> 24:45.320
student organizations of prestige other than the 
band? What

24:45.300 --> 24:57.450
were those local

24:45.300 --> 24:57.450
clubs? What were those local clubs, what did they 
do? They

24:59.430 --> 25:31.100
were just, for Christmas holiday, they all of us 
would sponsor a dance. Would this be for, just for

25:31.080 --> 25:34.100
that group, primarily? Well.

25:40.702 --> 25:42.950
This would be at College Station? No. Oh, back,

25:44.553 --> 26:02.090
oh, okay. Now, when the hometown club members, was 
that, was that a place to go to get help with

26:05.070 --> 26:11.650
homework? A lot of times you would get help. And

26:13.630 --> 26:20.640
maybe a ride home occasionally? Let's

26:20.620 --> 26:39.430
see, other student

26:20.620 --> 26:39.430
organizations,

26:20.620 --> 26:39.430
singing cadets, were they? Alright,

26:39.410 --> 26:59.990
so intramurals were important. And

26:59.970 --> 27:08.200
they were by core outfit. What

27:08.180 --> 27:23.660
sports were included? Touch,

27:23.640 --> 27:36.120
touch foot, touch football? Touch football.

27:40.635 --> 27:41.280
Swimming? Water polo? Okay. Mustard.

27:50.472 --> 27:58.290
Do you remember

27:50.472 --> 27:58.290
mustard when you were a student? What about final 
review?

28:04.940 --> 28:05.688
Describe it.

28:08.457 --> 28:08.780
Held? MSE? On the

28:10.583 --> 28:34.960
drill

28:10.583 --> 28:34.960
field where?

28:34.940 --> 28:37.960
Alright, now, so final review for you is held in the 
spring of 1941. What did you and your classmates

28:37.940 --> 28:42.960
think was ahead for you? Did you all get along? Did 
you all, did you all have fun? Did you all have fun?

28:50.560 --> 28:56.690
Did

28:50.560 --> 28:56.690
you all get along? Did you all have fun? In the 
dormitories, did you all talk much about what was

28:57.670 --> 29:04.250
going on in Europe? Some, but not as much as you'd 
think. Did you all anticipate? We weren't

29:10.800 --> 29:23.420
really very, didn't go near much, by the way. So, 
you didn't, you weren't assuming that the U.S.

29:23.400 --> 29:50.490
would certainly be in the war.

29:50.470 --> 30:02.580
Let's see, do you remember any world events that 
caught your attention while you were a student? I

30:02.560 --> 30:28.710
kept up with the seeing

30:02.560 --> 30:28.710
how this would

30:02.560 --> 30:28.710
run away.

30:28.690 --> 30:45.860
Did you and your fellow students assume that if we 
had a problem, it would be in Europe or in the Far

30:28.690 --> 30:45.860
East?

30:45.840 --> 30:56.860
See, I tell students that people of our age, once we 
get to December 7th, we remember where we were when

30:45.840 --> 30:56.860
we heard that news. Franklin Roosevelt's death 
and so forth, but I can't think of any event that

30:56.840 --> 31:03.860
would have caused you and your fellow students 
before the spring of 1941, I can't think of

31:03.840 --> 31:14.860
anything that would have stopped you in your 
tracks. Like the Germans invading Poland, no,

31:14.840 --> 31:21.860
there wouldn't have been an interruption of every 
radio station. No, not that. Let's see. I'll tell

31:25.769 --> 31:27.330
you the biggest effect would be.
