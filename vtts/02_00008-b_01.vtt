00:02.343 --> 00:32.248
About how

00:02.343 --> 00:32.248
many times did you go home during the academic 
year? Freshman, sophomore, Thanksgiving,

00:33.292 --> 00:42.663
Christmas, maybe Easter, I don't know. That's 
all. That was largely the fact that I had this mess

00:44.845 --> 00:49.631
all around me. No Sergeant King did not like me to 
ask for meals, particularly if you were a freshman

00:49.651 --> 00:58.040
or something. I just got to be a junior. That's 
another thing. After I got to be a lot of part of my

01:02.975 --> 01:12.715
junior year and senior year, I took another job. 
Senior

01:13.522 --> 01:36.762
year.

01:37.484 --> 02:03.195
Bupo,

01:37.484 --> 02:03.195
who

01:37.484 --> 02:03.195
died recently,

01:37.484 --> 02:03.195
and married Evelyn Lacey from Dunmore, Newtown. 
And senior year, I bet Bupo a dollar against a rifle

02:03.215 --> 02:04.797
on all the football games. And, of course, I wiped 
him out, and he hauled me back to Dallas for about a

02:04.817 --> 02:06.599
second week. By that time, I was doing So I traveled 
back and forth, I guess, maybe 15 or 20 times.

02:18.677 --> 02:19.338
Senior. Senior.

02:22.763 --> 02:23.363
Let's see. We were doing the Y. All right, Guyon 
Hall. What did Guyon Hall, what did it, what role

02:26.948 --> 02:30.853
did it play? Well, very little. It was an engineer. 
That's the place where you got your diploma. Did

02:37.222 --> 02:40.345
you go to a movie over there or a speech? How

02:40.606 --> 02:57.725
often did you go to a movie? That costs money.

03:02.652 --> 03:06.356
All right, let's go then on, let's say it's 
Saturday night. What would you and your buddies do

03:07.176 --> 03:14.864
for a good time on a Saturday night if there's not a 
football weekend or anything like that? Well,

03:17.306 --> 03:28.957
maybe the freshman, you try to get the buddy to step 
away somewhere to get out of the

03:17.306 --> 03:28.957
dormitory area. And they mostly talk. Where would 
you go to do that?

03:37.727 --> 03:45.095
Really?

03:45.656 --> 03:57.870
Right.

03:58.238 --> 04:04.668
So you seldom ate off campus for fun, just to go eat 
somewhere? Seldom. Never. Never. Okay. I really

04:08.294 --> 04:16.146
don't

04:08.294 --> 04:16.146
went to home until I was a junior, never leaving the 
campus to go eat. I've heard of Hardlickers. Where

04:21.434 --> 04:24.639
was Hardlickers? Hardlickers was... I think down 
at 12 and a little east. And they had to see, there's

04:33.077 --> 04:38.963
a dry county there, part of it. And you'd have to go 
across the road to the other side of Bradless Road.

04:43.989 --> 04:44.910
To Whiskey Bridge. Yeah. And it wasn't that old 
until just about three or four years ago. That old

04:50.155 --> 04:54.059
building was still there. It's gone now. I didn't 
drink Hard Liquor. So I didn't get into too much

05:02.013 --> 05:06.561
Hard Liquor. Now somebody mentioned to me running 
wood and water and I've never found anybody,

05:07.703 --> 05:16.937
somebody said ask them about that one and I'm not 
hurting. What about Uncle Ed's? Was Hard Liquor's

05:19.522 --> 05:21.164
Uncle Ed? They had Hard Liquor. Was that a 
respectable place? Well, it's a... Or if you went

05:28.258 --> 05:31.562
to Hardlickers, would you not admit it? You 
wouldn't admit it to your folks, but you'd admit it

05:33.164 --> 05:36.347
to all the rest of the people in the campus. Oh, you 
would? Okay, to your buddies. Okay. All right.

05:39.791 --> 05:43.475
Describe what was... You wouldn't tell your 
professors that you'd been hanging out at

05:39.791 --> 05:43.475
Hardlickers. Describe what was at Northgate when 
you were a freshman. I mean, when you were an

05:47.359 --> 05:49.602
undergraduate. What was over there? Well, Luco 
had his place there. On the corner? Campus

05:55.366 --> 06:17.370
theater?

06:19.112 --> 06:20.413
Was there a theater there then?

06:23.296 --> 06:26.442
Was there anything at Southgate?

06:29.407 --> 06:32.011
Eastgate?

06:33.494 --> 06:46.637
If

06:33.494 --> 06:46.637
you came or went on the bus, you got off there,

06:33.494 --> 06:46.637
the railroad station That carried a lot of people 
in that time. Usually the hitchhiking started at

06:53.313 --> 06:58.200
the East Gate. Alright, describe the routine of an 
Aggie hitchhiking.

07:04.990 --> 07:05.671
You wanted to go somewhere. You didn't have the 
money. You got a bus. And besides that, the bus

07:10.038 --> 07:15.005
schedule was awful. You hitchhiked. I could take, 
I don't know, 1,000, 1,000, maybe 10,000, 15,000

07:18.089 --> 07:27.142
miles. And that was the thing, when you got there, 
you lined up. And that wasn't by, that was one thing

07:32.028 --> 07:36.675
where there was no rank. When you got there, you had 
your place. And then you had to use good judgment.

07:40.941 --> 07:45.447
Some kind of truck would come by and say, man, go 
into Navasota. Then you have to decide whether you

07:46.523 --> 08:06.043
want to go to Mappasota, and hitchhike to 
Mappasota, or whether you want to stay there and

07:46.523 --> 08:06.043
maybe get a ride that'll take you closer to 
Halstead, or closer to Houston, or all the

07:46.523 --> 08:06.043
way to Houston. It's amazing, almost everyone 
would come by at 8 a.m. to see me.

08:12.850 --> 08:15.653
And you never had an incident or a problem? Do you 
remember any unusual characters that gave you a

08:17.253 --> 08:39.700
ride?

08:40.135 --> 08:55.379
and

08:40.135 --> 08:55.379
a couple of hostages picked me up and they were used 
to getting laid down. And they were trained with

08:55.399 --> 08:59.646
the aqua and the pollution and they were trained 
with the whole deal. They all took

09:00.250 --> 09:04.154
responsibility. No, but I didn't

09:04.174 --> 09:09.139
have any money. So, that's just one of the last 
great opportunities for me, I guess. Did you ever

09:13.643 --> 09:14.324
run? Then I, then I, I remember one thing very

09:14.344 --> 09:21.671
much. At, you're talking outside that building, 
that Y at Houston State, the college station where

09:21.751 --> 09:29.599
your Y off to the ground, the college station. And 
that was a pretty popular place, and see at that

09:30.237 --> 09:46.713
point I had to go to Fort Brown, and then down to 
McRae's, and that

09:30.237 --> 09:46.713
was fun. We

09:46.993 --> 09:54.821
were there, and there was some lions, and they had a 
convention somewhere in that area. And there was a

09:54.841 --> 09:58.344
car full of them driving, funding to drive a car. 
See what I mean? I remember those. They apparently

10:00.173 --> 10:07.701
had more fun than they should have. They came in and 
couldn't make me smile with them. We were right or

10:09.523 --> 10:10.424
left. So we went right at us. And you talk about 
Aggies there now. We all managed to get out of the

10:17.011 --> 10:18.593
way. He ran that thing up there with a bunch of 
bushes. Got in high center. And they got out there

10:26.662 --> 10:29.505
and they were stupid.

10:32.793 --> 10:40.742
So, we would give him hell for gambling all those.

10:41.884 --> 10:45.268
But finally, we all got together. We sat his car 
back on the road and waited for him to come back. It

10:53.618 --> 10:55.560
was a pretty strange experience to see this. And 
the car came right, and we thought he turned left,

10:55.980 --> 10:59.965
but he came straight on. important personalities 
that visited the campus while you were a student?

11:08.625 --> 11:13.052
Were there any famous people, entertainers, 
politicians, government, generals? Anybody?

11:25.050 --> 11:27.954
They have been, but that's an impression on me. You 
know, we didn't have the the student government

11:30.640 --> 11:46.181
did, we didn't have the entertaining,

11:30.640 --> 11:46.181
that place for them to come to entertain.

11:48.003 --> 11:57.596
There were, there was a professor, a general out of 
the Office of Chief Engineers came by there for

11:48.003 --> 11:57.596
some type of a review of the military, which is, you 
know, that's one of the things that they did. And I

11:57.616 --> 11:58.217
don't remember his name. Religious activities on 
the campus. What were they and where were they? On

12:05.156 --> 12:13.165
or around?

12:13.185 --> 12:15.627
Did you and your buddies go to church on Sunday? Or 
go to chapel? What did you do on Sunday morning?

12:26.459 --> 12:27.040
Sleep late? The

12:27.762 --> 12:37.881
Ware Field House was the, what happened there?

12:42.409 --> 12:51.205
Describe an Aggie basketball game

12:42.409 --> 12:51.205
then. Did

12:51.590 --> 13:02.106
y'all go to the games? All right, then let's talk 
about important football. Tell me about Aggie

13:05.935 --> 13:08.359
football in the late 30s. That was important. We 
had some bottom teams. I didn't want you to see me

13:13.186 --> 13:15.088
there. We lost one game. I had the great football 
experience.

13:25.243 --> 13:30.591
Who were the favorites as human beings among those 
football stars? Who did y'all like best as a

13:32.528 --> 13:39.215
person?

13:39.235 --> 13:42.459
A lot of people liked Ron Nett. Marshall Foote. Joe 
Roberts was a favorite. I liked Willie Knesset. I

13:50.387 --> 13:55.132
liked John Kimbrough, and they had a good 
computer. Where was Marion Pugh from? He wasn't a

13:58.035 --> 14:01.759
native of, I know he would live there afterward. 
And the coach, tell me about him. Oh, you really?

14:21.236 --> 14:21.857
Court trips. Describe a court trip during your...

14:30.545 --> 14:34.369
ones that I remember. Of course, we had Cotrip 
Dallas and

14:34.530 --> 14:45.182
Cotrip Houston. Houston, I had relatives that 
stayed there. Dallas,

14:46.884 --> 14:51.209
I stayed with friends that lived in Dallas. There. 
And someone, like one friend, last Cotrip we took

14:51.449 --> 14:56.755
to Dallas, his family had put up six of us. How

14:59.148 --> 15:19.810
did you get up there and

14:59.148 --> 15:19.810
back?

15:20.811 --> 15:27.838
So it'd be Dallas and Fort Worth in alternate years 
and Austin and Houston. Do you remember any court

15:28.207 --> 15:34.813
trip events particularly?

15:37.755 --> 15:41.438
Snafus, jokes, big events?

15:47.844 --> 15:56.211
Oh yes,

15:47.844 --> 15:56.211
a few. See the microphone. run around,

15:57.805 --> 16:07.058
night clubbing. One thing that was real funny,

16:07.078 --> 16:27.087
my junior year, the Rice

16:07.078 --> 16:27.087
kids that, that's something you know, And so they 
were very concerned

16:27.590 --> 16:50.517
that when we came back on senior year, that we were

16:27.590 --> 16:50.517
going to retaliate on the campus. So we had told 
them that we were concerned that we would get a unit

16:57.728 --> 17:07.743
of seniors

16:57.728 --> 17:07.743
and guard their campers. And they did it. And so we 
went down there Friday afternoon and we guarded

17:10.307 --> 17:14.013
their campers. And the kids just could have killed 
it in the administration. They just hated it. They

17:20.442 --> 17:23.026
were, I mean, right there we brought our campers. 
We brought all the buildings, you know. Here were

17:24.949 --> 17:26.071
Aggies standing? Yeah, all seniors and boots. How

17:27.918 --> 17:49.146
did an Aggie get a date for a court trip weekend?

17:52.310 --> 17:55.174
Probably many different ways. Of course, the

17:55.475 --> 18:04.484
Dallas KCW was some of my sister's group. And there 
were a lot of mutual connections there. And we'd

18:10.010 --> 18:12.172
get blind dates. And I don't know, Aiden Rice would 
go to Rice games. They'd let somebody know

18:15.896 --> 18:17.798
somebody, and then get somebody else. And about, I 
guess, two-thirds of the dates were blind dates.

18:23.003 --> 18:24.705
And some of them were real blind, too. Did y'all 
have nicknames for an ugly date? I don't remember

18:31.307 --> 18:33.850
that. Were there moose pots? Yeah. Describe that. 
I don't know for sure what a moose pot was. I've

18:41.821 --> 18:50.372
heard that you and your buddies would all chip in 
and whoever had the worst date got the money. I

18:51.714 --> 18:53.356
didn't anticipate that. That sounded like a good 
idea. There always was a worse date. Are there any

18:59.138 --> 19:02.523
blind date experiences you had that you can share? 
I avoided them. Basically I avoided blind dates.

19:08.853 --> 19:13.981
But one or two I had, it would have turned out pretty 
well. I didn't have to get really hung like some of

19:14.002 --> 19:18.148
the guys. All right, let's go then to a football 
game day in College Station. Take me through the

19:25.032 --> 19:26.654
whole day. Well, one of the days when you had a date. 
Either way. Well, let's do both. My normal day was

19:34.546 --> 19:42.077
I'd go down and start lining things up. and work on 
the concession stands, or party popcorn, or

19:42.732 --> 19:51.785
peanuts in the stands. That is freshman and 
sophomore. In junior year, I sort of ran the

19:54.108 --> 20:05.244
concession stands and we would dish out the stuff 
and collect the bananas and the freshman and

19:54.108 --> 20:05.244
sophomore. On the rare occasion when I did do that, 
you'd meet and

20:12.078 --> 20:31.016
walk around campus showing everything there was. 
They'd usually come up and we'd make in some of the

20:31.036 --> 20:33.040
domiciles and go through the state of that site.

20:42.622 --> 20:57.115
Almost every, some type of dance

20:42.622 --> 20:57.115
I think that we have ever gained, which we won't get 
this week. Maybe, by the way, it would be the same

20:57.135 --> 20:58.496
with something we've gained. Describe the 
conduct of people at a dance. Where was it held, and

21:03.741 --> 21:06.944
how did people act? A

21:06.964 --> 21:10.907
lot of the dance was a muscle. I thought it was kind 
of like a tour. You would have every year great

21:16.119 --> 21:19.504
bands. Such as? You know, Dolce,

21:21.708 --> 21:34.751
the Galatines, and

21:21.708 --> 21:34.751
all that. I know at least one or two of those, but 
they're things on campus. And that music, you

21:36.273 --> 21:37.215
know, went on. How

21:37.465 --> 21:57.463
did people... And

21:37.465 --> 21:57.463
how did the young men and women dress for the dance? 
And what would they wear?

22:05.910 --> 22:06.831
And... Did they behave well? Well, compared to the 
present situation,

22:10.166 --> 22:17.935
I'd say conduct was absolutely... Alcohol? Some. 
Do you remember anybody getting drunk that day?

22:23.802 --> 22:26.565
Rare.

22:26.805 --> 22:30.529
Because what I've heard, things seem 
comparatively orderly. Yeah. Let's see, all

22:32.632 --> 22:35.535
right, during the game, Where did you fish sit? Or 
where did y'all stand during football? If we had

22:43.918 --> 23:03.464
dates,

22:43.918 --> 23:03.464
we'd either go high up in the stands, a little bit 
separated, but if you had a date, the

22:43.918 --> 23:03.464
upperclassmen would treat you a little better. 
Particularly if you had a good-looking date. Then

23:05.688 --> 23:07.791
they'd want you to stand right in the middle. Did 
y'all, was there a pass by before the game? Did

23:13.038 --> 23:14.499
y'all march in by units?

23:25.133 --> 23:28.678
During your, particularly your junior and senior 
year, y'all won a lot of games. What happened at the

23:28.738 --> 23:32.623
end of a game that y'all won on campus? Now

23:34.223 --> 23:48.776
who was to capture the yell leaders and throw them 
in the pond? Were there yells, were the same yells

23:49.076 --> 23:52.459
given then as now?

23:57.103 --> 24:03.589
Has much changed during the game, the band and so 
forth that you remember?

24:04.902 --> 24:20.403
Did

24:04.902 --> 24:20.403
y'all

24:04.902 --> 24:20.403
respect you students not in the band? Did y'all 
respect the band? I did. There were some of them We

24:28.612 --> 24:40.027
were a little anti-band because the band didn't 
have to participate in the classes. Other student

24:40.047 --> 24:48.439
organizations of prestige other than the band?

24:48.459 --> 24:54.707
We had, you know, all the, there were lots of local 
clubs. Like in the back of the county, A&M Club. So

24:57.063 --> 24:59.285
what were those local clubs, what did they do? 
Well, we just, we'd meet, maybe on

24:59.806 --> 25:23.051
Sunday

24:59.806 --> 25:23.051
afternoon, or Saturday afternoon or something, 
and just get together. And over Christmas

25:23.071 --> 25:24.372
holiday, all of us would sponsor a dance. We'd play 
a dance, and the colors would still shine. Would

25:28.231 --> 25:33.699
this be just for that group primarily? Well, we 
would invite all the students and other people.

25:40.709 --> 25:42.712
This would be at College Station? No. Oh, back. Oh, 
okay. And I know I've got a lot of people in Sweden.

25:49.782 --> 25:54.128
They're making silver and money for something 
like that. It would be a good time to charge them.

25:56.935 --> 26:10.733
Now,

25:56.935 --> 26:10.733
when the hometown club members, was that a place to 
go to get help with homework? And

26:12.795 --> 26:20.065
maybe a ride home occasionally? That

26:20.105 --> 26:26.453
wasn't a There wasn't enough cars to fill

26:27.327 --> 26:39.085
a two-car garage at home. I'm

26:39.125 --> 26:50.483
not sure

26:39.125 --> 26:50.483
which district it was from.

26:57.466 --> 27:00.329
All right, so intramurals were important. 
Intramurals were extremely

27:01.611 --> 27:06.356
important. And they were by core outfit.

27:22.133 --> 27:25.937
What sports were included?

27:27.318 --> 27:35.209
Touch

27:27.318 --> 27:35.209
football. Touch football.

27:41.458 --> 27:41.858
Swimming.

27:45.123 --> 27:54.877
Water polo.

27:56.779 --> 27:57.240
Mustard. Do you remember muster when you were a 
student? What about final review?

28:08.407 --> 28:09.068
Describe it.

28:20.661 --> 28:27.008
Held

28:27.916 --> 28:28.276
Where?

28:34.542 --> 28:34.962
MSC? On the drill field where? Right. So final 
review for you is held in the spring of 1941.

28:45.471 --> 28:53.298
What did you and your classmates think was ahead 
for you?

28:56.981 --> 28:57.602
Did you all? In the dormitories, did y'all talk 
much about what was going on in Europe? Some, but

29:06.615 --> 29:09.799
not as much as you'd think. Did y'all anticipate? 
We weren't really very sophisticated in, you

29:11.000 --> 29:16.906
know, our outlook on foreign affairs and that. 
Didn't know nearly as much about it as the kids

29:16.926 --> 29:20.390
could remember. Of course, that isn't very much 
because the kids and I were people of the farm. You

29:25.578 --> 29:30.483
didn't, you weren't assuming that the U.S. would 
certainly be in the war.

29:35.328 --> 29:37.570
I did. Listen to that. Some of our, you know, 
military instructors know. They were convinced

29:42.556 --> 29:47.000
that we would go into it.

29:50.464 --> 29:50.884
Let's see. Do you remember any... world events 
that caught your attention while you were a

29:54.873 --> 30:01.161
student?

30:02.864 --> 30:04.326
I kept up with the U.P. War very closely. I've 
always been an interested student in geography

30:07.029 --> 30:17.864
and seeing how this was unwinding things and 
changing things. Newspapers were always

30:17.884 --> 30:22.770
publishing new maps and all showing them the 
boundaries were. Did

30:23.105 --> 30:36.121
you and your fellow students assume that if we had a 
problem it would be in Europe or in the Far East?

30:39.926 --> 30:46.534
I know I wasn't sophisticated enough to try to sort 
something like that out. See I tell students that

30:46.574 --> 30:48.657
people of our age, once we get to December 7th, we 
remember where we were when we heard that news.

30:57.649 --> 30:59.572
Franklin Roosevelt's death and so forth. But I 
can't think of any event that would have caused you

31:00.173 --> 31:14.393
and your fellow students before the spring of 41, I 
can't think of anything that would have stopped

31:00.173 --> 31:14.393
you in your tracks. Like the Germans invading 
Poland. No, that wouldn't have. there wouldn't

31:19.062 --> 31:21.732
have been an interruption of every radio station. 
No, not that. Let's see. I'd say the biggest effect

31:25.867 --> 31:31.266
of the war in Europe and L.A.
