WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:32.232
About how many times did you go home during the academic year?

00:33.275 --> 00:48.730
freshman, sophomore, Thanksgiving, Christmas, maybe Easter, I don't know, I'm sure.

00:48.750 --> 00:49.251
That's all.

00:49.271 --> 00:49.912
That's all.

00:49.932 --> 00:54.216
And that's largely the fact that I had this vessel down.

00:54.236 --> 01:00.722
The old Sergeant King did not like me to ask me about it, particularly if you were a freshman or something.

01:00.742 --> 01:01.383
That's got to be a junior.

01:01.743 --> 01:02.404
That's another thing.

01:02.924 --> 01:19.049
After I got to be a lot of employment during the year and the same year, I took another job.

01:19.069 --> 01:20.511
I had a job at the fiscal department, Charlie Raven News.

01:21.183 --> 01:32.038
around the house with Arianna's family.

01:32.058 --> 01:32.699
He was in the fiscal department.

01:32.719 --> 01:33.200
He got a job down there.

01:33.220 --> 01:38.487
I gave him more revenue as far as he came to the center.

01:38.507 --> 01:47.600
Senior year, Bupo died recently and married, had a little license from down my own town.

01:47.620 --> 01:48.321
And senior year, I've had Bupo

01:49.381 --> 02:10.764
a dollar against a rifle on all the football games.

02:10.784 --> 02:12.626
And of course I wiped them out and he hauled me back to Fort Harrisville by the second week.

02:12.646 --> 02:13.347
By that time I was going back home.

02:14.255 --> 02:18.622
So I traveled back and forth, I guess, maybe 15 or 20 times.

02:18.642 --> 02:19.303
Senior.

02:19.323 --> 02:22.709
Senior.

02:22.729 --> 02:26.916
Let's see, we were doing Y. All right, Guyon Hall.

02:26.936 --> 02:30.541
What did Guyon Hall, what role did it play?

02:30.842 --> 02:34.227
Well, very little to an engineer.

02:34.248 --> 02:35.790
That's the place where you got some diploma.

02:37.205 --> 02:40.748
Did you go to a movie over there or a speech?

02:42.490 --> 02:54.142
How often did you go to a movie?

02:56.824 --> 02:57.705
Maybe twice a year.

02:58.826 --> 02:59.527
That cost money.

03:02.249 --> 03:06.874
Alright, let's go then on, let's say it's Saturday night.

03:07.073 --> 03:14.841
What would you and your buddies do for a good time on a Saturday night if there's not a football weekend or anything like that?

03:17.284 --> 03:28.997
Well, if he was a freshman, he'd try to get his buddies to step away somewhere to get out of the dormitory area.

03:29.017 --> 03:32.100
And it would get the emotional talk to sit down and shoot the ball.

03:32.260 --> 03:34.903
Where would you go to do that?

03:37.060 --> 03:41.385
Sometimes we'd walk for the way it was real.

03:41.405 --> 03:41.545
Really?

03:41.565 --> 03:44.629
You'd just walk.

03:44.649 --> 03:45.630
Just take a walk.

03:45.650 --> 03:50.015
And after sophomore, of course, there'd be such a big room.

03:50.035 --> 03:58.185
But then we'd go first and start after dinner and just keep on going, you know, until everybody ready to go to bed.

03:58.205 --> 03:58.325
Right.

03:58.345 --> 04:03.752
So you seldom ate off campus for fun, just to go eat somewhere?

04:04.693 --> 04:05.053
Seldom.

04:05.594 --> 04:05.734
Ever.

04:05.900 --> 04:16.089
I really don't recall until I was a junior, never leaving the campus.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.912
I've heard of Hard Liquors.

04:21.394 --> 04:34.185
Where was Hard Liquors?

04:34.672 --> 04:43.942
There's a dry county there, part of it, and you'd have to go across over to the other side of Bradley's River.

04:43.962 --> 04:45.063
The Whiskey Bridge.

04:45.343 --> 04:45.984
Yeah.

04:46.004 --> 04:53.251
And it was that old, until just about three or four years ago, that old building was still there.

04:53.872 --> 04:56.635
Yeah, it's done now.

04:56.655 --> 04:58.637
I didn't drink that.

04:59.056 --> 05:07.307
So I didn't get involved too much hard liquor in Boston.

05:07.667 --> 05:16.119
Now somebody mentioned to me running wood and water and I've never found anybody, somebody said ask them about that one.

05:16.139 --> 05:16.780
And I've not heard.

05:16.940 --> 05:19.623
What about Uncle Ed's?

05:19.844 --> 05:21.125
Was hard liquor's Uncle Ed?

05:23.789 --> 05:26.953
Was that a respectable place?

05:28.081 --> 05:31.526
Or if you went to Hard Lakers, would you not admit it?

05:33.149 --> 05:36.735
You wouldn't admit it to your folks, but she admitted to all the rest of the people in the campus.

05:36.755 --> 05:37.977
Oh, okay, to your buddies.

05:37.997 --> 05:38.678
Okay, all right.

05:38.698 --> 05:43.445
All right, describe what was... You wouldn't tell your professors that you'd been hanging out at the Hard Lakers.

05:44.267 --> 05:47.311
Describe what was at Northgate when you were a freshman.

05:47.331 --> 05:49.575
I mean, when you were an undergraduate.

05:49.675 --> 05:50.356
What was over there?

05:50.557 --> 05:53.381
Well, Luke O'Headers Place Center.

05:54.102 --> 05:54.603
On the corner?

05:55.044 --> 05:55.945
Yep, all at Luke.

05:56.093 --> 05:58.816
company had a place there.

05:58.836 --> 06:02.120
The post office is there now.

06:02.140 --> 06:05.504
It had just been built new.

06:05.524 --> 06:08.427
So it was there.

06:08.447 --> 06:13.453
And there was a couple of short order joints.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.156
I don't know what that names anymore.

06:16.617 --> 06:17.378
And... Campus theater?

06:19.060 --> 06:23.705
Was there a theater there then?

06:23.725 --> 06:24.666
I don't recall.

06:25.068 --> 06:26.390
Was there anything at Southgate?

06:29.354 --> 06:31.417
Fortunately not.

06:31.437 --> 06:31.957
Eastgate?

06:33.460 --> 06:34.160
Eastgate.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.125
That was out of the booths.

06:37.145 --> 06:37.325
Right.

06:37.485 --> 06:42.572
If you came or went on the bus, you got off there.

06:43.613 --> 06:43.834
Yeah.

06:45.316 --> 06:46.437
The railroad station.

06:48.760 --> 06:54.248
That carried a lot of people in that time.

06:55.358 --> 06:58.162
Hitchhiking started at the East Gate.

06:58.182 --> 07:04.853
Alright, describe the routine of an Aggie hitchhiking.

07:04.873 --> 07:16.551
You wanted to go somewhere, you didn't have the money, you got a bus, and besides that the bus schedule was followed, you hitchhiked.

07:16.571 --> 07:19.476
And I hitchhiked, I don't know,

07:19.996 --> 07:30.229
1,000, 1,000, maybe 10, 15,000 miles.

07:30.249 --> 07:37.298
And that was the thing, when you got there, you lined up.

07:37.318 --> 07:41.223
And that wasn't my, that was one thing where there was no rank.

07:41.243 --> 07:44.207
When you got there, you had your place.

07:44.227 --> 07:45.128
And then you had to use good judgment.

07:45.148 --> 07:47.571
Sometimes a truck would come by and say, man, go into Navisola.

07:47.591 --> 07:48.973
Then you had to decide whether you wanted to go to Navisola.

07:50.033 --> 08:15.636
And you never had an incident or a problem?

08:17.219 --> 08:42.940
Do you remember any unusual characters that gave you a ride?

08:43.325 --> 09:10.231
And they were trained with the whole deal, so they offered to stop their money.

09:10.251 --> 09:12.133
You know, but I didn't have any money, so that's one of the last great opportunities, I guess.

09:13.514 --> 09:14.635
Did you ever run?

09:14.715 --> 09:21.824
Then I remember one thing very much.

09:22.164 --> 09:27.170
It's like I saw that Y-A instead.

09:27.190 --> 09:29.553
It's in College Station where you run off to a ground in College Station.

09:30.574 --> 09:32.597
And that was a pretty popular place.

09:32.617 --> 09:38.904
And see at that point I had to go to the ground and then down to the grounds.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.829
We were there and

09:44.328 --> 10:05.036
and lot humps that had a convention somewhere in that area.

10:05.056 --> 10:07.639
And there was a car full of driving, a funding drive, a car.

10:07.659 --> 10:08.280
Mm-hmm, I remember those.

10:08.300 --> 10:09.322
They apparently had more fun than they should have.

10:09.342 --> 10:13.407
They came in and couldn't make the time whether they were going right or left, so they went right at us.

10:13.690 --> 10:34.495
We all managed to get out of the way.

10:38.380 --> 10:38.921
He ran that thing up there.

10:38.941 --> 10:39.301
A bunch of bushes.

10:39.321 --> 10:39.701
Got in high center.

10:39.722 --> 10:40.963
And they got out there and they were a stupid guitar.

10:41.213 --> 10:53.275
But finally we all got together, we set his car back on the road, and we were going.

10:53.295 --> 11:03.694
It was a strange experience to see this car coming right, and we thought he'd turn right or left, but he came straight on.

11:04.265 --> 11:14.480
Important personalities that visited the campus while you were a student, were there any famous people, entertainers, politicians, government, generals, anybody?

11:19.928 --> 11:20.008
Hmm.

11:25.056 --> 11:27.800
They may have been, but that's an impression on me.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.783
And, you know, we didn't have any.

11:30.607 --> 11:48.290
the student government there, we didn't have the place for them to come to entertain.

11:48.310 --> 11:58.504
There was a general out of the office of chief engineers came by there on some type of a review of the military, which is the only thing that they did, and I don't remember his name.

12:00.037 --> 12:02.359
Religious activities on the campus.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.602
What were they and where were they?

12:05.142 --> 12:06.464
Or on or around?

12:06.624 --> 12:13.151
Most of them off campus.

12:13.171 --> 12:15.574
Did you and your buddies go to church on Sunday?

12:17.976 --> 12:18.777
Or go to chapel?

12:19.918 --> 12:23.682
I usually attended the service Sunday night.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.405
What did you do on Sunday morning?

12:26.425 --> 12:27.006
Sleep late?

12:27.745 --> 12:32.370
and try to step off and take them out before they get away from it.

12:33.591 --> 12:37.856
The Warefield House was the... What happened there?

12:38.897 --> 12:41.640
It's where they had basketball.

12:41.660 --> 12:42.361
It's where you practice basketball.

12:42.381 --> 12:48.708
Describe an Aggie basketball game then.

12:48.728 --> 12:52.352
There weren't very many seats in the White House.

12:52.619 --> 12:59.744
A&M, as it is now, was not the greatest basketball school in the world.

12:59.764 --> 13:02.072
Did y'all go to the games?

13:03.858 --> 13:05.841
Alright then let's talk about important football.

13:05.921 --> 13:08.424
Tell me about Aggie football in the late 30's.

13:08.444 --> 13:10.226
That was important.

13:10.246 --> 13:13.451
We had some bottom of the teams.

13:13.471 --> 13:15.073
I had my junior senior there.

13:15.093 --> 13:18.117
We lost one game.

13:18.137 --> 13:19.699
So I had that one.

13:19.859 --> 13:25.186
Had the great football experience for us winning for some.

13:25.426 --> 13:30.473
Who were the favorites as human beings among those football stars?

13:32.528 --> 13:39.197
Who did y'all like best as a person?

13:39.217 --> 13:42.442
A lot of people like Rodney Allen.

13:42.482 --> 13:43.823
Marshall Fuller.

13:46.167 --> 13:48.009
Joe Robb.

13:48.029 --> 13:52.916
I liked Willie Connetson.

13:52.936 --> 13:55.099
I liked John Kimbrough and David Pugh.

13:55.139 --> 13:57.202
Where was Marion Pugh from?

13:58.023 --> 14:01.708
He wasn't a native of, I know he would live there afterward.

14:03.055 --> 14:04.757
Okay.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.019
And the coach, tell me about him.

14:07.720 --> 14:14.407
No, we didn't get to know him.

14:14.427 --> 14:15.628
Oh, you really?

14:15.648 --> 14:16.869
No, we didn't have to.

14:16.890 --> 14:19.632
Of course, we didn't have to promise all the games they won the firing and did.

14:20.814 --> 14:22.756
Uh, court trips.

14:22.776 --> 14:26.920
Describe a court trip during Europe.

14:30.477 --> 14:34.502
ones that I remember.

14:34.522 --> 14:40.890
Of course we had Co-Trip Dallas and Co-Trip Houston.

14:44.495 --> 14:45.376
Houston I had relatives to stay there.

14:45.396 --> 14:50.522
Dallas, our state of France, and Dallas.

14:50.542 --> 14:56.670
And someone, like one friend, last Co-Trip we took to Dallas, his family had put up six of us.

14:59.131 --> 15:12.904
and mostly we went up the afternoon before, Marching in the morning, went to the football stadium game, and back to the other station.

15:12.924 --> 15:14.546
Now how did you get up there and back?

15:17.168 --> 15:19.070
Hitchhiked mainly.

15:19.090 --> 15:19.790
A few cars.

15:20.791 --> 15:27.838
So it'd be Dallas and Fort Worth in alternate years, and Austin and Houston.

15:28.173 --> 15:29.475
Yeah, two court trips a year.

15:30.076 --> 15:34.782
Do you remember any court trip events particularly?

15:37.746 --> 15:38.727
Snafus?

15:38.847 --> 15:39.408
Jokes?

15:40.650 --> 15:41.411
Big events?

15:41.791 --> 15:55.911
Engineers did snafu.

15:55.931 --> 15:56.631
Oh yeah, a few.

15:56.652 --> 15:57.032
See the microphone.

15:57.822 --> 16:11.256
a lot of fun running around, night clubbing.

16:11.276 --> 16:24.049
One thing that was real funny, my junior year, the Rice kids that

16:25.345 --> 16:37.241
That's something another to annoy us.

16:37.261 --> 16:46.954
And so they were very concerned that when we came back, we were going to retaliate on campus.

16:46.974 --> 16:47.995
So, we had done a war, and they worked as I did it.

16:48.548 --> 17:13.333
They were concerned that we would get a unit of seniors and go to the campus.

17:13.353 --> 17:13.734
And they'd do that.

17:13.754 --> 17:15.656
And so we went down there Friday afternoon and we'd go to the campus.

17:15.676 --> 17:17.037
And the kids just could have killed the administration.

17:17.270 --> 17:23.597
They just hated it.

17:24.899 --> 17:26.000
Here were Aggies standing?

17:26.140 --> 17:29.163
Yeah, all seniors and boots.

17:29.183 --> 17:35.230
It must have been about six to seven months.

17:35.250 --> 17:38.574
Not that they were the right students just hated it.

17:39.575 --> 17:42.298
In fact, we only had police in their campus for them.

17:43.949 --> 17:49.097
How did an Aggie get a date for a court trip weekend?

17:52.262 --> 18:03.479
Probably many different ways in there.

18:03.499 --> 18:08.347
Also, at Port of Dallas, a guest together with some of my sisters.

18:08.367 --> 18:10.650
And there are a lot of little mutual connections there.

18:10.670 --> 18:11.712
And you can get blind dates.

18:11.995 --> 18:14.719
I don't know, even rice, the good rice games.

18:15.259 --> 18:18.444
They had somebody to know somebody and they had somebody else.

18:18.464 --> 18:22.229
And about, I guess, two-thirds of the dates were blind dates.

18:22.970 --> 18:24.552
And some of them were real blind, too.

18:26.575 --> 18:28.958
Did y'all have nicknames for an ugly date?

18:31.301 --> 18:33.865
Oh, yeah, bad.

18:33.925 --> 18:34.886
Were there moose pots?

18:35.707 --> 18:37.329
Yeah.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.030
Describe that.

18:38.050 --> 18:41.275
I don't know for sure what a moose pot was.

18:41.295 --> 18:41.395
Okay.

18:41.662 --> 18:50.335
I've heard that you and your buddies would all chip in and whoever had the worst date got the money.

18:51.637 --> 18:52.298
I didn't.

18:52.318 --> 18:56.163
That sounded like a hell of a good idea.

18:56.183 --> 18:58.146
There always was a worst date.

18:59.148 --> 19:05.577
Are there any blind date experiences you had that you can share?

19:06.130 --> 19:09.594
Basically, I wasn't playing ace.

19:09.614 --> 19:13.860
But in one or two ahead, it turned up pretty well.

19:13.880 --> 19:19.407
I didn't have to get really hung like some of the guys.

19:19.427 --> 19:24.474
Alright, let's go then to a football game day in College Station.

19:25.014 --> 19:26.636
Take me through the whole day.

19:28.579 --> 19:31.783
Well, one of the days when you had a date.

19:31.882 --> 19:32.883
Either way.

19:33.604 --> 19:34.564
Let's do both.

19:34.584 --> 19:46.535
My normal time was I'd go down and start lining things up.

19:46.555 --> 19:54.002
Work on the concession stands or popcorn or peanuts in the stands.

19:54.182 --> 19:57.825
That's a freshman and sophomore.

19:57.845 --> 20:01.028
In the junior year, I sort of ran on the concession stands and he released out the stuff and collected the money.

20:01.565 --> 20:26.756
Freshman, sophomore.

20:26.776 --> 20:29.420
On a rare occasion when I visited the office down, you'd meet Dave in Hawaii and walk around campus showing everything in the woods.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.441
They usually come up with some of the dormitories.

20:31.467 --> 20:45.522
It goes through the state of the last life.

20:45.542 --> 20:52.789
When you're in dance as well, it's a good person.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.012
Almost every, there was some type of dance.

20:55.032 --> 20:56.293
Maybe find a way to put the same look or something we're doing.

20:57.674 --> 21:03.485
Describe the conduct of people at a dance.

21:03.725 --> 21:08.233
Where was it held and how did people act?

21:19.774 --> 21:20.796
Such as?

21:21.299 --> 21:24.083
and all that.

21:24.203 --> 21:45.530
I know there's one or two of those different times on campus.

21:45.550 --> 21:47.512
And then rock and everything.

21:47.712 --> 21:50.496
How did people- More slow music.

21:51.607 --> 21:57.212
And how did y'all, did the men, young men and women dress for the dance?

21:57.232 --> 21:59.915
Well, we used to be uniform.

21:59.935 --> 22:00.735
And what would they wear?

22:05.860 --> 22:08.362
And did they behave well?

22:10.164 --> 22:17.431
Well, compared to the present situation, I'd say I'm not, absolutely.

22:17.451 --> 22:17.911
Alcohol?

22:18.712 --> 22:18.812
Some.

22:19.855 --> 22:22.679
Do you remember anybody getting drunk that day?

22:23.320 --> 22:23.761
Yeah.

22:23.781 --> 22:24.081
Rare.

22:26.325 --> 22:30.491
Because what I've heard, things seem comparatively orderly.

22:30.912 --> 22:32.574
Yeah.

22:32.594 --> 22:33.015
Let's see.

22:34.097 --> 22:38.143
During the game, where did you fish sit?

22:40.126 --> 22:43.431
Or where did y'all stand during football?

22:43.451 --> 22:45.694
We had dates.

22:47.429 --> 22:59.983
If you had a date, the other class would treat you a little better.

23:00.003 --> 23:05.730
Particularly if you had a good looking date.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.772
Then they'd want you to stand right in the moment.

23:08.653 --> 23:12.337
Did y'all, was there a pass by before the game?

23:13.038 --> 23:14.820
Did y'all march in by units?

23:21.398 --> 23:25.323
I think we did it back then.

23:25.403 --> 23:28.667
Now, particularly your junior and senior year, y'all won a lot of games.

23:28.808 --> 23:32.352
What happened at the end of a game that y'all won on campus?

23:34.595 --> 23:42.365
And then usually there was some kind of dance.

23:42.385 --> 23:46.891
Now, who was to capture the L leaders and throw them in the pond?

23:46.911 --> 23:47.592
That's the way it was.

23:48.398 --> 23:52.424
Were there yells, were the same yells given then as now?

23:53.665 --> 23:54.366
Basically yes.

23:56.589 --> 24:01.256
And has much changed during the game, the band and so forth, that you remember?

24:02.377 --> 24:08.406
No, the band then did just like they did now.

24:08.426 --> 24:09.327
Always wins ahead.

24:10.285 --> 24:12.567
That's one of the things that they used to get.

24:13.248 --> 24:16.872
They know that they won the football games, they lose the football games, they just won the hand.

24:17.493 --> 24:20.376
Did y'all respect you students not in the band?

24:20.396 --> 24:21.717
Did y'all respect the band?

24:23.239 --> 24:24.841
I did.

24:25.361 --> 24:33.129
There was some in, some of them were a little anti-band for the band.

24:33.149 --> 24:34.591
Didn't have to participate.

24:34.611 --> 24:36.333
And that's the way it goes.

24:36.353 --> 24:38.335
There were a few bands that year.

24:39.395 --> 24:45.083
Other student organizations of prestige other than the band?

24:48.628 --> 24:57.380
Well, we had all the... there were lots of local clubs, like the Black County Alien Club.

24:57.540 --> 24:58.702
What were those local clubs?

24:58.722 --> 24:59.283
What did they do?

24:59.823 --> 25:06.853
Well, we just... we met on Sunday afternoon.

25:07.458 --> 25:30.028
and just get together.

25:30.048 --> 25:31.430
And over the Christmas holidays, we had all of us to sponsor a dance.

25:31.450 --> 25:33.773
Would this be just for that group, primarily?

25:34.093 --> 25:36.216
Well, we would invite

25:36.736 --> 25:40.120
former students and other people.

25:40.661 --> 25:42.683
This would be at College Station?

25:43.024 --> 25:43.184
No.

25:43.204 --> 25:44.525
Oh, back.

25:44.545 --> 25:48.450
Oh, okay.

25:53.856 --> 26:06.051
Now, when the hometown club members, was that

26:07.313 --> 26:10.657
Was that a place to go to get help with homework?

26:12.639 --> 26:18.366
A lot of times you get stuff.

26:18.386 --> 26:20.007
And maybe a ride home occasionally?

26:20.047 --> 26:32.882
There wasn't enough cars to fill a two-car garage at home.

26:34.246 --> 26:39.052
Let's see, other student organizations, singing cadets, were they?

26:39.073 --> 26:44.420
They were there.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.201
I'm not sure.

26:48.385 --> 26:59.840
All right, so intramurals were important.

26:59.901 --> 27:03.966
No, intramurals were extremely important.

27:05.093 --> 27:11.082
And they were by core outfit.

27:22.098 --> 27:25.903
What sports were included?

27:33.595 --> 27:35.979
Touch football.

27:41.427 --> 27:41.847
Swimming.

27:45.092 --> 27:46.354
Waterfall.

27:50.540 --> 27:57.150
Muster.

27:58.211 --> 28:00.054
Do you remember Muster when you were a student?

28:02.418 --> 28:02.758
Not really.

28:04.662 --> 28:05.723
What about final review?

28:08.366 --> 28:09.047
Describe it.

28:20.661 --> 28:31.935
Held where?

28:34.362 --> 28:34.562
MSC?

28:34.582 --> 28:34.923
MSC.

28:35.663 --> 28:36.504
Oh, in the drill field where?

28:37.445 --> 28:37.545
Yeah.

28:37.565 --> 28:42.049
All right, now, so final review for you is held in the spring of 1941.

28:42.330 --> 28:42.590
Early.

28:45.453 --> 28:55.963
What did you and your classmates think was ahead for you?

28:56.964 --> 29:04.251
Did y'all, in the dormitories, did y'all talk much about what was going on in Europe?

29:06.442 --> 29:09.786
Some, but not as much as you'd think.

29:09.806 --> 29:10.947
Did you all anticipate?

29:10.967 --> 29:15.892
No, we weren't really very sophisticated in, you know, outlook on foreign affairs and that.

29:16.313 --> 29:19.276
Didn't know near much about his kids.

29:19.296 --> 29:26.644
Of course, that isn't very much because kids and I don't keep up with foreign affairs.

29:26.664 --> 29:29.147
So you weren't assuming that the U.S.

29:29.207 --> 29:30.468
would certainly be in the war?

29:35.434 --> 29:35.554
I did.

29:36.783 --> 30:01.170
Uh, let's see, uh, do you remember any world events that caught your attention while you were a student?

30:02.737 --> 30:04.299
I kept up with the U.S.

30:04.359 --> 30:06.421
War very closely.

30:07.001 --> 30:18.213
I've always been an interesting student in geography and seeing how this was unwinding things and changing things and all.

30:18.373 --> 30:28.043
Usually it was always publishing new maps and showing where the boundaries were and then Beijing for a few years and those stuff.

30:28.063 --> 30:28.684
I kept up with that quite well.

30:28.704 --> 30:30.786
Did you and your fellow students

30:31.593 --> 30:36.078
assume that if we had a problem, it would be in Europe or in the Far East?

30:39.883 --> 30:46.371
I know I wasn't sophisticated enough to try to sort something like that out.

30:46.531 --> 30:56.583
See, I tell students that people of our age, once we get to December 7th, we remember where we were when we heard that news.

30:57.645 --> 30:59.727
Franklin Roosevelt's death and so forth.

31:00.010 --> 31:14.329
But I can't think of any event that would have caused you and your fellow students before the spring of 41, I can't think of anything that would have stopped you in your tracks.

31:15.030 --> 31:17.073
Like the Germans invading Poland.

31:17.133 --> 31:21.740
No, there wouldn't have been an interruption of every radio station.

31:22.060 --> 31:23.382
No, not that.

31:25.104 --> 31:25.485
Let's see.

31:25.525 --> 31:29.410
I'd say the biggest effect of the foreign European army
