WEBVTT

00:01.853 --> 00:05.136
Yeah, you were standing next to MacArthur at a 
parade at West Point. Yeah, shoulder to shoulder,

00:05.236 --> 00:08.980
and he's no taller than I am. He's not as tall. I'm 
5'10 1⁄2". He's probably about the same. I'm going

00:14.104 --> 00:15.726
by his shoulder. And I was really surprised 
because he, of course, he's old, was then, but he's

00:15.806 --> 00:22.392
dead now. And one, as you get old, kind of, you know, 
you just don't look as robust and kind of stoop

00:22.412 --> 00:28.958
maybe to the shoulders, but... I always thought, 
because all of his pictures, he controlled that.

00:32.668 --> 00:42.303
You could do that in World War II, that he would 
never take a picture next to someone that he was

00:32.668 --> 00:42.303
considerable shorter than. And he'd always have 
the pictures taken at a lower angle.

00:51.699 --> 00:53.882
But he was a brilliant, particular writer. but not 
quite the total individual either. So in your

00:59.224 --> 01:04.492
opinion, Marshall would be the finest later in the 
war. He even agreed to or wanted, you know,

01:04.512 --> 01:17.572
Churchill wanted him to take Eisenhower's job or 
to be that meaningful. But Marshall, of course

01:17.592 --> 01:24.443
Roosevelt wanted to keep him in Washington, but 
didn't discourage him, but Marshall just felt

01:17.592 --> 01:24.443
that He could do more for the effort here. He had 
already started, you know, and got all this going

01:26.780 --> 01:29.463
support.

01:33.248 --> 01:40.777
But Marshall, all through the years, not only 
that, not only was he a leader, but he trained and

01:33.248 --> 01:40.777
developed people.

01:46.023 --> 01:51.329
If you look at some of these others, by that I mean he 
groomed them. And he had a knack of He selected all

01:55.051 --> 01:57.614
of our generals in World War II. Of course, he had 
recommendations of others. But he knew all of

02:00.998 --> 02:04.662
them. But mainly because of being such a 
statesman, Akers sort of proves to me that he had

02:04.682 --> 02:19.057
qualities and a depth of character and 
personality that you don't find in very many

02:04.682 --> 02:19.057
people. He probably would have made a great 
president, for example. Certainly much better

02:22.862 --> 02:25.024
than Eisenhower. Oh, Eisenhower wasn't a bad one, 
but I don't think history would judge him as being,

02:26.337 --> 02:39.012
I think he's probably a mediocre one, which most of 
them are. For sure. It isn't half the truth. Well,

02:43.256 --> 02:46.240
let's finish up on the German campaign. Once you 
got into Germany and once you crossed the Rhine,

02:46.260 --> 02:53.408
got into Germany, how did you get along with the 
German civilians? They were our enemies. Yeah,

02:56.063 --> 03:00.670
and we weren't permitted to fraternize.

03:01.711 --> 03:12.568
And I left on VE Day, so I hardly, I got along because 
they cooperated very well. And the Burgermeister

03:12.969 --> 03:17.556
had the town, if you told that Burgermeister that 
to get this street cleared here. You know, they had

03:19.772 --> 03:21.294
debris and so forth. Man, he'd have women and 
children out there doing it. He didn't say, oh, but

03:26.001 --> 03:28.064
there's no men. I just got women and children. Did 
you liberate any of the concentration camps?

03:36.335 --> 03:37.357
Unfortunately, yes. Which ones? I didn't think 
there was any. Not one of the big ones, but this is a

03:44.924 --> 03:48.028
journey. Just a minute, I think I've got my own 
world. I have quite a few females that are... The

03:54.578 --> 04:02.810
name is Landsberg, L-A-N-D-S-B-E-R-G. Yeah.

04:02.830 --> 04:06.956
That's not the album I'm looking for, but that's 
the information I'm looking for. And...

04:16.143 --> 04:17.905
And those females there. Tell me about, yeah, tell 
me, what was it like going into Landsberg?

04:24.851 --> 04:32.898
Well, it's very similar to all these other 
pictures you've seen of the larger ones with ovens

04:24.851 --> 04:32.898
for burning. But they had what I would call chicken 
cooks. They're low where a person can't stand and

04:39.785 --> 04:42.847
kneel. Mm-hmm. And they would put those people in 
there, and they would die. You'd think they're all

04:48.285 --> 04:55.413
dead, but you look real close, and you could barely 
see pulsation, you know, about like this in the

04:48.285 --> 04:55.413
stomach. Nothing but skin and bones. And they had 
some women, like the ones that you see there, that

04:58.296 --> 05:12.812
the only thing I can figure that they fed them and 
maintained them for sex purposes, because they

04:58.296 --> 05:12.812
had a lot of women with them. perfectly normal 
looking. And they were inside enclosure, but they

05:16.691 --> 05:20.815
had freedom. But they had cars like you saw that 
stacked with bodies, and the stench was just

05:21.816 --> 05:29.342
terrible. They had some who were still skin and 
bones that walked around but didn't know where

05:29.362 --> 05:36.709
they were, couldn't talk.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.035
What did you do for these people? There wasn't much 
we could do. The division, I think, got the German

05:48.029 --> 05:55.437
stuff, particularly in the villages around. They 
brought in a whole fleet of doctors and

05:57.239 --> 06:01.403
specialists. But there isn't much you can do for 
those that are already in the past. It's just a hell

06:07.049 --> 06:12.735
of a humane thing to get them out of their misery. 
But they tried to sort through them just like you

06:13.795 --> 06:21.883
would to find out those that are salvageable, 
those that need immediate medical attention. But

06:22.864 --> 06:25.667
except for those women, none of them were in good 
condition. You didn't see any health of male

06:25.687 --> 06:28.070
prisoners. It's just as if they were, which is 
better to go ahead and use the oven and get rid of

06:28.090 --> 06:35.417
them than to torture these people. Well, sure. 
Starve them to death. And the Germans claimed they

06:39.580 --> 06:44.307
knew nothing about it, but the stink, you could 
smell it for miles. They must have known something

06:44.347 --> 06:47.292
like that. Because they'd say, what is that bad 
smell?

06:51.778 --> 07:05.579
Plus, the Germans must have, the men that guarded 
the barracks, or guarded Landsberg, must have

06:51.778 --> 07:05.579
gone into town

06:51.778 --> 07:05.579
sometime. But the civilians... They just said 
that they didn't know anything about it. Yeah, I

07:10.341 --> 07:12.703
have to admit, this was a way. You could see 
Landsberg from where this camp was, but it wasn't

07:12.823 --> 07:18.369
right in the outskirts. It was a distance, but I 
don't see any keeping smelling that.

07:30.342 --> 07:37.650
Then we had trouble after, once again, those poor

07:30.342 --> 07:37.650
individuals that could walk. Of course, they all 
wanted to leave. Go wandering out to the

07:43.188 --> 07:45.710
community, and you couldn't have that. Those you 
had to try to get to a hospital. So you had to keep

07:49.073 --> 07:53.718
almost them under guard, which that was even 
pitiful. After finally getting freedom, still

07:53.938 --> 08:00.424
keep them under guard. Just for reference, we 
should cite this book, The Pictorial History of

08:06.520 --> 08:13.708
the 36th Texas Infantry Division. Who wrote this?

08:17.412 --> 08:18.853
Published in Austin, Texas. Edited by Staff 
Sergeant Richard A. Huff, H-U-F-F. Yeah, that was

08:19.935 --> 08:31.968
done as an

08:19.935 --> 08:31.968
official, you know, it wasn't any group work, 
though. That was an active duty type of thing. And

08:34.617 --> 08:40.623
we should have this in a footnote.

08:40.643 --> 08:45.308
That's a nice book.

08:45.328 --> 08:46.850
Now, you continued on. And at this time, you 
caught, not you, but you caught Gehring, Herman

08:48.351 --> 08:58.182
Gehring. Tell me about that. He has pictures in the 
back. Right there. Well, I wasn't there when that

09:03.059 --> 09:04.660
happened. Oh, you weren't? And von Rundstedt 
surrendered. You weren't there either? No. Okay.

09:09.966 --> 09:10.346
I left. This all happened after VE Day. Right, when 
they were trying to get into it. And I left. Well, I

09:15.771 --> 09:20.236
was in England, London on VE Day, so I left a day or 
two before that. Okay. But that was a big flap about

09:20.396 --> 09:22.218
this. Did you get into Austria? Did you get into 
Austria? Into Brooklyn. Mm-hmm. Yeah, into

09:27.263 --> 09:29.225
Brooklyn. Mm-hmm. In fact, we ended the war 
just... They were going not too far from where we

09:32.347 --> 09:36.271
left Italy to come back around. They had to go all 
through France.

09:41.558 --> 09:45.582
On the menu the day that they had him, they had fried 
chicken. And they fed Goring the same meal that

09:46.603 --> 09:52.390
everybody else had. But the press really jumped on 
about entertaining this filthy Nazi. And of

09:57.155 --> 10:00.379
course, they were treating him as a fellow 
officer. He had no purpose or reason to treat him as

10:06.629 --> 10:13.596
a convicted Nazi like a lay owner in a war trial. Of 
course, they never got him jailed, but he

10:13.616 --> 10:16.018
committed suicide. He was a prisoner.

10:23.506 --> 10:25.147
And so you got into Austria. And at this time, did 
you ever have any opportunity to meet any of the

10:26.208 --> 10:30.152
Russians? No. You never met any Russians at all. 
Was there any difference between how you were

10:35.395 --> 10:41.843
treated by the German people and how you were 
treated by the Austrians?

10:45.588 --> 10:48.572
I really wasn't in Austria long enough. When you 
left on VE Day, were you eager to go home or to the

10:50.274 --> 10:57.684
Pacific, or what were your thoughts? Well, I was 
eager to go home. But I knew that I was going to the

11:01.750 --> 11:11.720
school to Command General Staff College to 
prepare for really

11:01.750 --> 11:11.720
the invasion of Japan. In fact, our course there 
used the, it was classified, although it wasn't

11:13.121 --> 11:27.956
identified what it was, because it didn't use the 
Japanese home island by name. But it was really

11:28.677 --> 11:31.099
taking General MacArthur's plan for the ground 
invasion of the home of Japan. And after we had

11:36.522 --> 11:43.691
finished, then we were prepared to go join General 
MacArthur's staff or other staff.

11:47.996 --> 11:51.681
What did you think of the command in General Staff 
College? Oh, it was a six-month course in 1945? No,

11:54.444 --> 11:56.927
this too was about three months. But it was still a 
short war course. Yeah. Okay, what did you think

12:01.100 --> 12:04.685
about that college? I thought it was very good 
because I'd had all of the basic training, and I had

12:04.705 --> 12:15.781
all of the World War II experience from a second 
lieutenant to a... I was a regimental executive

12:15.801 --> 12:23.132
officer at the end of the war, a lieutenant 
colonel, regimental executive officer. And I

12:23.152 --> 12:30.162
wanted to, of course, get the experience of the 
command and stuff. Sure. Had you made up your mind

12:33.119 --> 12:44.089
when you heard on VJ Day that the war was over, were 
you convinced that you wanted to continue in the

12:33.119 --> 12:44.089
service and complete the career?

12:47.452 --> 12:48.072
Yeah. Did you ever think of any other alternative? 
Maybe after five years, maybe you wanted to go back

12:50.194 --> 12:57.661
to dairy husbandry or anything like that? Yeah, 
well, as I said earlier, If I hadn't gotten a

12:59.774 --> 13:08.287
regular commission, see, because that would have 
meant, after all of this experience, I'm still a

12:59.774 --> 13:08.287
young man. As I recall, I was only 28 years old, 
seeing a lieutenant colonel. If I wasn't

13:13.254 --> 13:19.664
qualified for a regular army commission, well, I 
certainly didn't think I was qualified to stay on

13:13.254 --> 13:19.664
in the reserve also. It was time to get. So I 
planned, if I didn't get a regular commission, I'd

13:22.007 --> 13:29.258
go back to A&M and probably a couple better

13:29.525 --> 13:33.897
there. And during this time, of course, this is 
rapid demobilization. America's army just

13:40.055 --> 13:43.264
shrinks in 12, military shrinks in 12 million to a 
million and a half in just a year and a half, and a

13:43.565 --> 13:57.257
number of officers are losing ground as far as rank 
because it was a temporary promotion. Did you go

13:57.317 --> 14:05.544
from a lieutenant colonel down a grade?

14:05.564 --> 14:11.850
We were very fortunate because Sweet Larson, who 
later on became a Lieutenant General commanded

14:12.961 --> 14:17.628
the Army out to Presidio, California. He was the 
aid to the Chief of Staff. And Eisenhower had

14:23.818 --> 14:37.939
indicated that for morale purposes,

14:23.818 --> 14:37.939
we should move from temporary rank back to 
permanent rank. Well, Swede Larson was the aid to

14:39.361 --> 14:41.685
the I forgot who the chief of staff was. In fact, 
some had already been moved from a colonel to a

14:48.779 --> 14:54.965
lieutenant colonel. They thought at the time that 
you'd lose your colonel, but you would become a

14:54.985 --> 15:01.511
senior lieutenant colonel. But they found out by 
law, after they'd already reduced that colonel,

15:02.732 --> 15:07.196
he couldn't. He had to go way back to what he was as a 
lieutenant colonel. And so that meant that He had

15:14.538 --> 15:19.723
attained rank, most of them battlefield 
promotions, like mine. He would be working for

15:20.704 --> 15:29.251
someone who never got to be colonel, who maybe 
hadn't even fought in World War II. He would be

15:29.271 --> 15:31.073
junior to him. Well, old Swede Larson convinced 
his boss that this is going to have a tremendous

15:31.894 --> 15:42.503
effect on the Army, because it's going to affect 
more people On the upper end, those whose morale is

15:42.837 --> 15:50.766
enhanced or boosted because of the reduction of 
the junior, although I can see their point. They

15:50.806 --> 16:06.024
say, my gosh, this guy here went, in my case, from a 
second lieutenant to a lieutenant colonel, and

15:50.806 --> 16:06.024
quite a senior lieutenant colonel by that time, in 
about two and a half years. Here, I've been in the

16:06.845 --> 16:12.372
Army, they say, 20 years, 22, maybe even longer. 
And I'm a lieutenant colonel. Why should I be

16:15.178 --> 16:20.045
serving under this young guy the rest of my career? 
It's not my fault, says he, that I was kept at

16:21.487 --> 16:35.527
Leavenworth or somewhere like Major Orr I told you 
about when he was at A&M. He was the prison officer

16:35.587 --> 16:42.797
at Leavenworth because he was over age for combat. 
Because combat has to be, as a young, I could never

16:43.098 --> 16:51.046
pull it as a battalion commander if I hadn't been 
young, up in those holes. So

16:51.286 --> 17:04.498
you can see, in fact, the first time I saw him, while 
I was a student at the Command and Staff College, I

16:51.286 --> 17:04.498
ran across, he's a lieutenant colonel then. And he 
looked at me and he said, Andrew, You're a

17:14.553 --> 17:15.915
lieutenant colonel. And he looked at his own 
shoulder. And I'm a lieutenant. You were a cadet

17:21.764 --> 17:26.070
student in my class. Here you rank the same rank as

17:26.150 --> 17:35.304
I am.

17:35.324 --> 17:38.669
But fortunately, it didn't get down to me. A lot of 
colonels were reduced to lieutenant colonels.

17:41.713 --> 17:44.357
But they stopped after they found out was going to 
have on those, because those were, some of them

17:45.637 --> 17:53.609
were as young as I was, but they ended up awarding 
the colonels. I almost was the colonels. I was a

17:54.991 --> 17:56.473
regimental executive. I was going to be promoted 
pretty soon to regimental commander.

18:06.663 --> 18:09.648
And also had a lot of other morale to be young. At 
Fort Benning, I was an instructor there. Right,

18:11.851 --> 18:18.922
and that's where you went right after September 
1945 and stayed there until 1948 at Fort Benning.

18:18.942 --> 18:28.156
And you see, I was a 28-year-old lieutenant 
colonel, and I rated because of rank, a big set of

18:18.942 --> 18:28.156
quarters. On each side of me were officers. When I 
was a lieutenant colonel, who much older in most

18:34.270 --> 18:36.333
service, you know.

18:40.338 --> 18:44.223
So some of them felt that some of us got promoted too 
fast, too soon. Well, once again, the only reason

18:44.283 --> 18:52.194
we got promoted fast, so soon, so quickly, was 
because of the war. The survival of the fittest,

18:52.234 --> 18:56.820
not the fittest, the luckiest. Yeah, that was a 
very interesting assignment because I was in the

19:04.358 --> 19:08.162
training management part. And that was part of the 
general section. And what exactly is that? Well,

19:11.265 --> 19:15.969
in the general section, which I remember, we had 
leadership, map reading. Training management

19:17.711 --> 19:27.360
was

19:17.711 --> 19:27.360
methods of instruction, training to be an 
instructor. We ran the course on all new

19:27.380 --> 19:34.247
instructors had to take just about a week's 
course.

19:36.218 --> 19:42.327
Then we were graduating about

19:36.218 --> 19:42.327
one OCS class a day. It was really this peak. Of 
course, it cut back at the BJ day. But we still had

19:48.416 --> 19:52.822
all of these in the pipeline. And so most of our load 
was also candidate school.

20:00.434 --> 20:02.817
And as soon as BJ day, did you immediately cut down? 
Well, it gradually cut down to one every other day,

20:03.404 --> 20:19.067
and then finally one a week, and then cut back on it.

20:19.087 --> 20:30.323
But besides the methods of instruction, or how to 
be an instructor and the technique of

20:19.087 --> 20:30.323
instruction,

20:19.087 --> 20:30.323
the management of Training in as an S3, for 
example, how do you make out a training schedule?

20:36.609 --> 20:44.378
How you should schedule certain subjects, those 
which involve physical activity after lunch, for

20:36.609 --> 20:44.378
example. And although they ought to say now you 
shouldn't do that, you should have something

20:44.398 --> 20:49.123
else. But you go to sleep after lunch, 
particularly young guys that have been working

20:49.143 --> 20:55.630
hard, that type of thing.

20:59.013 --> 20:59.854
Training aids. the types, how do you make them and 
how you use them, techniques and so on. That sounds

21:06.234 --> 21:08.458
more educational than military. Yeah, it was a,

21:08.718 --> 21:26.888
it was a, but very important on techniques on the 
stage and the, you even got people who don't even,

21:08.718 --> 21:26.888
just don't think they'll, they'll believe the 
troops out in the sun or face in the sun. So the

21:27.475 --> 21:29.497
instructor doesn't have to look in the sun. Here, 
those poor devils got to sit there and stand. At

21:31.579 --> 21:39.908
least you can see them where both of them have some 
sun and no sun.

21:39.928 --> 21:43.431
It was during this time that you attended glider 
school. Why? Well, because we

21:44.713 --> 21:55.904
were teaching not in ours, but out in yours. There 
they taught us. how to load and lash gliders. You

22:02.587 --> 22:04.209
know, we were still using them then. Sure, 
absolutely. We used them in France. We would even

22:06.271 --> 22:10.537
use dual tow with the C-47. And so, since we were 
involved with that, we had their department

22:11.998 --> 22:17.065
involved with us. We taught classes down there. I 
just wanted to broaden myself and know about it.

22:24.154 --> 22:26.116
Plus, you got glider badges. That's just 
another... So it's partially ambitious, part

22:28.445 --> 22:32.873
ego, part adventure, I guess.

22:36.960 --> 22:43.973
During this time, right when you were about to 
leave in 1948, President Truman

22:46.315 --> 22:58.006
had an executive order, pronounced an executive 
order, in which he integrated the armed services

22:46.315 --> 22:58.006
and started to have all the units integrated in the 
army. Do you remember that? What was your opinion

23:00.968 --> 23:05.713
of that?

23:05.733 --> 23:15.141
Well,

23:05.733 --> 23:15.141
it was

23:21.432 --> 23:24.797
It was inefficient, really, to have all black 
units.

23:28.983 --> 23:46.747
Not only was it inefficient for the military 
structure,

23:28.983 --> 23:46.747
but it contributed to a disciplinary

23:28.983 --> 23:46.747
problem.

23:46.767 --> 23:47.929
And it tended to highlight because you did have 
this one with all those blacks together and so

23:48.280 --> 24:13.174
forth that the blacks were troublemakers because 
all you had to have one or two to get into trouble and

23:48.280 --> 24:13.174
of course they said what's that damn black unit you 
know again they can't trust them

23:48.280 --> 24:13.174
so i thought that was a good step now there's one 
thing that i don't think that the military should

24:15.635 --> 24:24.106
be used for, and that's to solve social problems in 
our society. Now, Truman made the military guinea

24:24.126 --> 24:28.531
pigs on this, see? And it worked out fairly well. We 
still had colored units and black units in the

24:32.236 --> 24:37.984
Korea War. They

24:38.144 --> 24:44.612
did better, for example. with white officers than 
they did with black officers. Now, that doesn't

24:47.854 --> 24:50.877
mean that the black officer is not as good as the 
white officer. It just means that the blacks seem

24:50.897 --> 25:01.887
to respond better to white officers because

24:50.897 --> 25:01.887
they're one of us, and I'm a second-class citizen. 
In other words, our prestigious stature will be

25:01.948 --> 25:10.616
enhanced by having white officers. That was their 
feeling. I'm told. I never served with one, but I

25:13.014 --> 25:16.298
spent some time in Korea. And as a staff visit or an 
observer, when I went to check on their cadets who

25:17.580 --> 25:33.080
were in Korea and survived at that time.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.423
And since then, it's just been proven. We've got so 
many outstanding black officers, for example,

25:39.807 --> 25:41.269
particularly the Air Force. I can't call his name 
now, but he's really a top fighter pilot and

25:42.110 --> 25:51.123
leader.

25:51.143 --> 25:57.091
But we're facing the same thing now with using 
females in the armed forces. We'll get to that

25:57.131 --> 25:58.112
later. As far as the blacks are concerned, did you 
ever, when you were in Europe in the campaign in

25:58.152 --> 26:08.246
Europe, did you ever work with or alongside any 
totally black units? No. Because most of them were

26:09.102 --> 26:13.846
service units, water master, transportation. 
And they were back in the supply areas. And I don't

26:17.130 --> 26:25.597
remember ever seeing the black up in the area in the 
forward position. Well, I've seen the truck

26:25.617 --> 26:30.902
drivers, because we used a long haul, had a name for 
it. Red Ball Express went all across France and

26:30.922 --> 26:34.125
then Germany. A lot of those drivers were black. In 
fact, many of them were, some of them. But no, I

26:40.526 --> 26:45.012
never did have any.

26:45.032 --> 26:47.836
Of course, I was raised with black. Some of my 
friends, good friends in Caldwell were black. Of

26:52.301 --> 26:54.484
course, they didn't go to school with us. We had 
black schools. But that was so stupid and

26:56.567 --> 27:03.055
inefficient to run two facilities. But it's 
turned out it does. It's worked to the

27:05.060 --> 27:17.715
disadvantage to the black, because the black 
teachers have great difficulty here in Austin,

27:05.060 --> 27:17.715
same way, to compete with white teachers and 
coaches, you know, that sort of thing. And if

27:17.735 --> 27:24.364
they've been discriminated against, it's just 
that at least they appear not to be as well

27:17.735 --> 27:24.364
qualified. So in Cowell, when they integrated the 
school, they lost a bandmaster. They lost a coach.

27:30.085 --> 27:39.580
They lost some teaching and administrative 
people who were functioning on that because you

27:30.085 --> 27:39.580
just didn't need them, which makes it so 
inefficient, of course, to operate two systems.

27:39.600 --> 27:44.989
You've got to have

27:39.600 --> 27:44.989
management people. Were you happy when you got the 
assignment to West Point? Oh,

27:50.378 --> 27:54.564
yeah. Yeah. Because I wanted to be a cadet.

28:00.258 --> 28:03.923
didn't make it, so I figured this would be the 
second best thing. Of course, the cadets said,

28:03.963 --> 28:06.947
this is the best thing. They said, did you get here? 
You're up here for four years. Of course, it was a

28:11.292 --> 28:12.414
assignment. It was three years. I've extended a 
year. They said, here you are. You're going

28:16.499 --> 28:23.007
through the same thing we are, and you're going 
through as a lieutenant colonel, and we have to go

28:16.499 --> 28:23.007
through as a cadet. Now, there's one thing that I 
have often heard about the West Point. versus the

28:26.836 --> 28:38.427
Aggie officers, and that is that some people have 
charged that there is a sort of West Point

28:26.836 --> 28:38.427
protective agency or whatever. And I was 
wondering, is that what you found in your military

28:38.447 --> 28:43.553
group? Just the opposite. Just the opposite. They 
had to lean over backwards. Well, of course, I

28:50.680 --> 28:56.185
admit that you have to... You can't goof off. I 
mean, if you're a problem guy, of course, West

28:59.096 --> 29:02.859
Point has nothing to do with that. I mean, 
everybody certainly is. Thank you. Oh, yes, I

29:09.625 --> 29:11.167
always heard that. Most of that is a sour grapes 
type of thing. They call them the ring knockers.

29:16.391 --> 29:23.137
Whenever they get together, the first thing they 
do, and that's to let everybody know I'm a West

29:16.391 --> 29:23.137
Pointer, you know, for the rest of them. So all of 
the ring knockers can excuse themselves and go in

29:23.157 --> 29:26.340
there. plot how they're going to run the army and 
run the military. No. Just the opposite.

29:38.203 --> 29:45.813
Besides the luck I keep preaching about, I have 
been helped by West Point all through my career. I

29:46.955 --> 29:53.543
mentioned about Denholm, for example, coming and 
replacing the battalion commander Jones that was

29:46.955 --> 29:53.543
captured. He taught me so much, and I often thought 
that if I hadn't had the experience with him, if I'd

29:54.434 --> 30:06.427
had Jones to continue on. Nothing I have means to 
say derogatory against National Guard officers.

30:10.231 --> 30:11.112
I was one myself. But some of those officers had 
never been trained. Some of them, even up in New

30:15.257 --> 30:19.301
York, it was a social club. They played polo, and it 
was just like a... It's very difficult to get in. It

30:23.874 --> 30:25.335
was a closed type of thing. You had others who, in 
the community, they had been, for example, life

30:27.838 --> 30:33.584
insurance business. So they weren't 
professionals. They had solicited from all the

30:35.386 --> 30:39.511
people they were commanding, and they weren't 
about to offend them. They didn't like to

30:39.551 --> 30:41.033
discipline anybody. A professional officer, a 
regular army officer, if he's fair and if he has

30:42.254 --> 30:51.424
duty in our country, he'd go to look at everybody 
the same way. And then on came in, and I'd had more

30:52.501 --> 31:02.253
experience than most of the National Guard 
officers, because I'd been in the Army, the

30:52.501 --> 31:02.253
regular Army unit, for a year. Plus, I'd had a 
couple of summer camps, one summer camp before I

31:02.874 --> 31:11.865
went on Thomas tonight, two weeks.

31:11.885 --> 31:16.471
But I hadn't been to the basic school of competing 
until as a National Guard officer. So everything

31:16.751 --> 31:21.377
I'd learned, but I learned about morning report 
and all the other things. a lot of management, such

31:21.678 --> 31:27.064
as supply, mess, how to inventory things. So at 
least I had some knowledge, but I still had a lot to

31:27.965 --> 31:33.531
learn from Denholm. Now, Denholm ended up a major 
general, but he was a real intellectual. He wasn't

31:39.917 --> 31:41.579
a spit and polish guy. In fact, he even wore his 
uniform kind of like most people would put their

31:41.739 --> 31:49.828
trousers and their boots and blouses. Not 
Denholm. He puts them in and crimps them. I don't

31:53.988 --> 32:03.437
mean he didn't shine his brass and all that, but I 
just meant that he wasn't like Captain Moses I

31:53.988 --> 32:03.437
mentioned. You could just take his picture and put 
it in a magazine and say, here's how a uniform

32:04.178 --> 32:11.465
should be worn. What did you learn from Denholm? 
The main thing I learned was standards.

32:21.888 --> 32:31.318
If a soldier, for some reason or another, ran off 
and left his rifle or radio, well, the trucking

32:21.888 --> 32:31.318
officer said, well, this is combat. The guy said, 
you know, people get killed, not dental. He called

32:37.024 --> 32:40.527
in the guy and he says, where did you leave it? Oh, 
what was the situation? Oh, gosh, they were firing

32:42.189 --> 32:45.232
and that sort of thing. He says, all right, you're 
going back and get it. Well, I can't do that. He

32:51.417 --> 32:54.061
said, Art, you need a court martial there. 
Government equipment costs the taxpayers a lot of

32:54.902 --> 32:57.325
money. And you have a responsibility to safeguard 
it. If you could get out safely, you could have

33:01.270 --> 33:04.674
brought out your rifle or a radio. In this case, I 
think it was a radio. And so he sent him back and got

33:08.559 --> 33:10.101
it. He didn't get hurt. He came back with 
equipment. And boy, the word spread all around

33:12.224 --> 33:14.046
him. You better not leave it in the lake with that 
guy. He'll send you back to get it. Of course, he was

33:19.837 --> 33:20.898
doing that. He was a real leader. He knew it 
impressive. Another thing, we had people who

33:23.600 --> 33:35.011
would pitch their tent, and because they'd be too 
lazy to use a tent peg and put it in, they would tie it

33:23.600 --> 33:35.011
to a tree. And, of course, the wind blows a tree, and 
it strikes a tent, and any fool knows that. With

33:40.335 --> 33:47.402
Denholm, he would have them lined up, and if they 
weren't lined up, we're talking about out of the

33:40.335 --> 33:47.402
line now, see? But he knew that's Standards must be 
established away from combat. And he was, and he

33:54.025 --> 33:58.609
built that unit up morale. See, this is after the 
Soleil-Colore

33:58.970 --> 34:04.015
deal, you know. And they were feeling sorry for 
themselves, those who survived. We had some who

34:06.238 --> 34:09.601
made it out across, and they lost their friends, 
you know. Boy, this is really tough. And he really

34:11.764 --> 34:13.145
bucked them up. So he had standards. And he set the 
example. Yet he was fair and he would listen, but he

34:20.165 --> 34:26.631
expected you to do the same thing that he did. And 
pretty soon you saw the unit. They just stood up a

34:29.113 --> 34:31.776
little tall. You saw that they were. And this is 
what makes you feel good as a commander. You'd be

34:37.180 --> 34:43.466
marching down the road, and there are other units 
there. Those units look just like us before

34:43.486 --> 34:48.771
Denholm, and you'll hear the soldiers say, He 
said, look at that area. How do they get by with

34:51.180 --> 34:52.361
that? You know, they're the only ones that have 
standards. Now they're comparing it. Before

34:55.624 --> 34:56.745
then, they didn't know it. Well, everybody does 
that. But see, once again, living above the level

34:58.667 --> 35:02.751
of the common mass. So he worked with us, and they 
responded to people that respected him at first.

35:11.178 --> 35:13.581
They thought he was a West Pointer. You know, 
that's who he's bred. Well, he's one of those. But

35:17.284 --> 35:18.285
pretty soon, they... recognized that Denholm was 
a leader. He had standards. He expected us. What he

35:25.717 --> 35:27.500
was doing was for our own good. The mess improved, 
because he supervised the mess. He'd come around.

35:32.749 --> 35:33.771
There's a battalion commander. He goes, those 
messes. And he knew what was on the daily menu. He

35:38.059 --> 35:39.301
says, all right, let me see. You've got potatoes in 
there. And of course, they were dehydrated

35:40.443 --> 35:43.328
potatoes. And he'd go take a look at it. Of course, 
it cooked and ruined them by adding so much water.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.282
You know, it's not even tomato soup. It would be 
some kind of a problem. And he found things, and he

35:53.687 --> 35:55.369
knew how. He'd been to a cook's and baker's school. 
And why he did it, it's like I went to glider school.

36:00.115 --> 36:05.682
Not that he was ever going to be a cook or baker, but 
he would be a better judge, apparently. And so he

36:05.702 --> 36:07.925
knew about it. And he'd get the package out and say, 
you're just not preparing this properly. And it

36:12.630 --> 36:13.872
isn't fair to the men. I don't care about you, but 
they're the ones that have to eat it. And I could go

36:18.463 --> 36:20.245
on and on. And so the next time we went into combat, 
we did much better and carried this work as high. We

36:31.637 --> 36:33.839
didn't lose any equipment. We didn't leave 
anybody on the so-called battlefield.

36:39.565 --> 36:43.369
I know that people have criticized the Marines 
because they'll go out and risk life more life to

36:43.855 --> 36:47.480
save, try to save somebody that's needed. But it's 
not the bodies in it count, it's just like the Aggie

36:47.500 --> 36:52.646
spirit, it's the spirit of the thing. Knowing that 
if I'm out there, somebody's going to come and get

36:52.706 --> 36:59.876
me, or try their damnedest thing. So it really 
helps the unit. So then after we came out of the line

37:01.558 --> 37:07.766
again, we were surprised we were going training. 
Oh, we're combat troops, you know, we don't train.

37:13.420 --> 37:14.041
Oh, yes. We would have village training, see. So I 
was out training, and this was good. It got their

37:20.567 --> 37:25.713
mind off of all their problems, you know, the 
family at home and the ones in law. And they used to

37:25.733 --> 37:27.895
smoke and all the other things. They used to take 
infantry coordination. And we got to be village

37:30.998 --> 37:34.222
experts. And you don't have as many cases, because 
everybody knows what they're doing. And it's a

37:37.105 --> 37:37.826
team. It's just like a Dallas Cowboys working out 
and working. So that's what I say. He was a real

37:42.884 --> 37:45.126
leader, and he was fair. The next one was Paul D. 
Adams, who retired now as a general.

37:55.117 --> 37:56.058
Was he a West Point? Yeah. So he was a regimental 
commander that replaced Martin, the one who was so

37:57.600 --> 38:07.251
unhappy about everything. The one who met me at the 
train and so forth. Paul D. Adams, same thing. Now,

38:11.977 --> 38:15.081
I came to Paul D.M. I'd never known him before, 
potentially.

38:21.591 --> 38:23.033
And he was a regimental commander. And I was in 
Denholm's battalion, see. But I knew what was

38:28.921 --> 38:31.906
going on. I got to be Denholm's S3. In fact, I was his 
S3 at the Rapido River. I wasn't the company

38:37.193 --> 38:40.498
commander there.

38:46.351 --> 39:00.809
I give you an example of the fairness of where the

38:46.351 --> 39:00.809
Denholm and also Paul D. Adams contributed to my 
success, at least by promoting

38:46.351 --> 39:00.809
me. We had some officers coming from the United 
States. Paul D. Adams' classmate was coming over.

39:11.022 --> 39:13.725
He was in the . personnel pooh, particularly the 
senior officers when they placed them. So he was

39:19.090 --> 39:26.360
looking for a position, he wanted a battalion, of 
course everybody did, was supposed to be a

39:19.090 --> 39:26.360
battalion commander. And so he came to see Paul D. 
Adams, and Paul D. Adams said, well, yeah, I'll

39:28.043 --> 39:34.913
take you. But he says, I want you to know that you're 
not coming as my classmate, you're coming to me as a

39:43.237 --> 39:48.645
Lieutenant Colonel Replacement Battalion come 
in and you're not going to get any favors from me. Oh

39:50.268 --> 39:52.711
yes, he understood that and so he went off. So he 
came and he took the battalion. Denholm went to

39:56.057 --> 40:01.505
another job and he took Denholm's battalion. I 
guess Denholm became executive officer to Paul

40:01.905 --> 40:04.750
Neatom. Yeah, that was it. And he was a good guy. We 
liked him. Everything's going along fine. He

40:11.603 --> 40:15.930
didn't quite have the standards, and he was kind of 
nervous a little bit. But we were in Italy, outside

40:17.232 --> 40:23.221
of Rome, and I was up with the troops. We were 
attacking. And Paul D. Adams came up there. He

40:29.570 --> 40:34.938
said, right now I can't call the battalion 
commander. He says, where are the, I called the

40:34.958 --> 40:38.183
battalion commander. And he said, I said, well, I 
don't know. He was here just a short time ago. He may

40:43.998 --> 40:45.440
be back at the CP. I don't know. Why isn't he up here? 
Here he's kind of chewing me out, you know, me and

40:48.083 --> 40:50.466
the exec. In other words, he said, what the hell are 
you doing up here with the exec? If anybody's back

40:52.709 --> 40:54.772
at the CP, it ought to be the exec. And I said, well, 
he was just up here. I thought I'd stay up here

40:57.074 --> 41:01.160
because there's some German tanks up ahead up 
here. He says, all right. So he left. And Later on, I

41:09.704 --> 41:17.294
don't know where he went, but later on, he had both 
of us as CP. I guess I came back then. Now, these are

41:21.540 --> 41:23.302
very mature individuals. They're old. He's a 
class of 30, 27, I believe. And he called me in, I

41:29.630 --> 41:37.381
guess, as a witness, because it's a kind of poor 
leadership technique. But he wanted me in there.

41:39.792 --> 41:41.835
And he started chewing him out. He gave him hell. 
The commander, the battalion commander, he

41:44.598 --> 41:47.382
started chewing him out. Yeah, and so he reacted 
by, of course, he was kind of relaxed, you know,

41:47.422 --> 41:52.668
with an attempt. And he could see that old Paul Lee 
was really mad, so he came to the attention and put

41:53.550 --> 42:00.238
those heels together. And he said, you came here as 
a battalion commander. I told you that you

42:04.083 --> 42:05.925
wouldn't have any favoritism. I'm not going to 
have a battalion commander that stays back in the

42:05.945 --> 42:09.630
CP. while his unit is in attack, and certainly to 
have the exec up there instead of you. At least

42:19.051 --> 42:22.094
you've got an exec that will go up there and see 
what's going on. And he tried to tell him that I was

42:23.235 --> 42:28.601
just there and just left. He was trying to tell him 
that he had a mission. He had a legitimate reason.

42:32.946 --> 42:35.588
No need for both of us to be up there. And he 
interrupted me and said, I don't want to hear an

42:35.608 --> 42:38.031
excuse. I know what I saw, and I don't want to ever 
see it again. Now, you understand that. I'm going

42:42.058 --> 42:44.381
to give you one more chance. I'm going to relieve 
you and save you back. Yes, sir. And he saluted

42:48.247 --> 42:50.330
Boyle and marched him out.

42:55.797 --> 42:57.420
So then we went into Southern France.

43:00.825 --> 43:06.853
Meantime, Paul D. had moved me over to get me a 3rd 
Battalion, not the 2nd that I'd been in all the

43:00.825 --> 43:06.853
time. And we've already talked about that. Now, 
he's got the second battalion. He happened to go in

43:13.958 --> 43:19.845
down by that airstrip where the Germans were. And 
he led the attack as a lieutenant colonel out in

43:19.865 --> 43:27.235
front or with a two-lead company. And the machine 
gun boy just got him from the shoulder all the way

43:27.255 --> 43:32.622
down like that. He survived, no, but he's all shot 
up. He can't walk in a wheelchair. And there's no

43:39.277 --> 43:51.458
doubt in my mind that that chewing out by his 
classmate caused him to take undue chances that he

43:39.277 --> 43:51.458
shouldn't have taken and probably wouldn't have 
taken if he hadn't got this. And so you don't find

43:51.478 --> 43:53.080
that at all. You find just the opposite. See, here I 
get praised and get promoted and given a

43:54.823 --> 43:58.930
battalion. There's one West Pointer taken off 
after another West Pointer. Yeah, and a

44:03.447 --> 44:05.850
classmate, see? And I've seen many other, those 
experiences that I've had.

44:12.657 --> 44:18.042
In other words, they're so interested, they're 
very interested in upholding the standards of

44:12.657 --> 44:18.042
West Point. That's right. The real ones. And two, I 
got promoted to general officer in these other 70s

44:21.746 --> 44:28.293
or something. Wow. He's just amazed how many West 
Point graduates never make general losses.

44:35.667 --> 44:38.270
Retires currently.

44:39.672 --> 44:49.466
And the chief of staff we've had, non-West Point, 
that were selected by a West Point graduate.

44:50.027 --> 44:51.289
So that doesn't give them it all. I found just the 
option. I said, I could go on and on. So that's an

44:53.712 --> 44:56.336
unjust allegation. Now, I'm sure that there are 
examples. Sure, just like I was telling you about

45:00.031 --> 45:11.082
the Spirit of Agon and going and buying tires from 
Phoenix Data, there's some that would probably

45:00.031 --> 45:11.082
give somebody a break there. But the real leaders 
that we have, they're not about to ever, they're

45:11.102 --> 45:18.089
bent over backwards the other way. Now my boss at 
West Point, for example, was G, Ned G, West Point

45:18.109 --> 45:23.774
Accord. There's only about three of us there that 
weren't driving. Well, later on he got five. And he

45:31.169 --> 45:35.254
has helped me through all my... He's the one who 
made me the deputy head of the department or

45:35.274 --> 45:40.361
whatever the hell they call it, assistant. He 
asked for me for another year, extension, see,

45:41.142 --> 45:53.778
four years, and gave me outstanding official 
reports, as Denholm did and all the others did. And

45:54.940 --> 45:56.582
nearly every commander I've had had been West 
Point graduate that I worked for. Now what did you

46:01.790 --> 46:03.673
teach when you were at West Point? Military 
psychology and leadership? Leadership. I went to

46:06.577 --> 46:12.044
Queens College for a while to take several courses 
in psychology. Went

46:13.827 --> 46:22.959
there and we had a newly organized department. We 
had it once before. You know who organized it once

46:23.961 --> 46:27.025
before and then they finally phased it out? 
General MacArthur. Really? And then they phased

46:29.694 --> 46:30.895
out. Then they decided to do it. See, they weren't 
teaching a course in psychology, basic

46:36.000 --> 46:39.783
psychology. And they felt truly so that that was a 
void in the cadet's education. Because from then

46:47.430 --> 46:54.457
on, it was all, of course, the other disciplines. 
But there wasn't enough humanity. So.
