00:03.052 --> 00:05.314
You ask me a question like this, it sounds like a lot 
of ego. Well, it's true, but I dare say

00:05.354 --> 00:16.404
most of it by far was sincere ego on the parts of all 
the rivals. Or sincere concern. Some.

00:18.906 --> 00:22.209
Picky-oonish and absolutely unreasonable. 
Okay. Who were those some? I'd say the lesser

00:26.353 --> 00:32.518
informed and lesser capable.

00:36.177 --> 00:42.267
It'd be hard to pick out an individual by name, and 
I'd say it's unreasonable. It's the old story,

00:42.908 --> 00:58.894
just a man is, by the time you spent your whole 
career in the service and been indoctrinated in

00:42.908 --> 00:58.894
the

00:42.908 --> 00:58.894
doctrines and principles

01:04.797 --> 01:11.645
It's difficult to

01:04.797 --> 01:11.645
make a man change his mind. Now, one of the things we 
were taught in Air War College is there's certain

01:12.326 --> 01:19.695
doctrines and principles and strategies. Now, 
the question that's always raised, and this was

01:19.715 --> 01:32.290
obvious in the Southeast Asian War, because a lot 
of technological advances were made, is does

01:33.569 --> 01:44.461
weapon systems and new innovations in weapon 
systems dictate strategy, or does strategy

01:33.569 --> 01:44.461
dictate weapon systems? This isn't a black and 
white, this doesn't require a black and white

01:45.022 --> 01:52.350
answer, and there is no black and white answer. The 
actual answer is both. It just depends.

02:00.459 --> 02:03.542
Now, certainly, the atomic bomb a nuclear 
armament, there's no doubt it dictates strategy.

02:13.213 --> 02:16.516
A laser-guided bomb, let's say that is a little bit 
different. Let's say that

02:16.536 --> 02:22.301
has an impact on tactics. But there's always this 
question here in which the generals are going to

02:22.701 --> 02:29.748
disagree and discuss or debate or argue. Right. 
But this doesn't change principles in command and

02:31.028 --> 02:40.260
the influence of people and the use of people who 
make decisions. For instance, you can induce all

02:41.061 --> 02:44.425
the computers you want, but they handle data. It's 
the decision the man makes, the commander makes.

02:51.354 --> 02:55.879
I'm getting to the specific part of the commander 
of all air. One man has to do all these things. And

02:59.142 --> 03:00.885
there's one man that should do it. Now, he can 
delegate certain things to certain areas and

03:00.905 --> 03:09.298
certain times, but one man has to do that, one air 
commander.

03:13.765 --> 03:26.685
The solution that was finally arrived at in 
Southeast Asia, to the best of my knowledge, was

03:13.765 --> 03:26.685
that all coordination was done at AT, at 7th Air 
Force. I don't remember, I believe, I think

03:28.066 --> 03:39.360
General O'Meara did get a naval guy in his 
headquarters, if you will, a naval liaison

03:28.066 --> 03:39.360
officer. Now, I know there was one at- By the way, I 
think you said this before, but his headquarters

03:39.380 --> 03:46.509
was in Saigon, wasn't it? Where was his 
headquarters? At Tonsenute Air Base in Saigon.

03:50.234 --> 03:51.175
Okay. As well as General Westmoreland. Oh, yeah, 
yeah. He was right with Westmoreland. Right,

03:56.682 --> 03:57.263
right. There was practically Jason one of them. 
But the coordination of, for instance, the

04:02.036 --> 04:08.663
selection of targets and all. Now, this was 
primarily done by General . And the man that

04:13.808 --> 04:23.397
selects the targets and sets up the rules of 
engagement, now that, you might say, is the

04:13.808 --> 04:23.397
commander. He really has command then.

04:28.799 --> 04:30.661
Well, let's talk about Mollmeyer. We've talked 
about him, and I want to talk about some of his

04:30.982 --> 04:34.447
personalities here. We've mentioned a lot of very 
important people here, and I want to talk about

04:34.467 --> 04:40.895
them and get your impressions or opinions of them. 
And let's start with him, Mollmeyer. Well, I knew

04:42.838 --> 04:43.899
him. What type of person was he? He was a very 
private person, very dedicated. Matter of fact, a

04:54.073 --> 04:57.878
hard man to meet. I often thought Spike must have 
been an awful, awful lonely person. Now, a

05:04.823 --> 05:08.388
commander is a lonely person. Speaking 
generally, he is a lonely man, a commander is. But

05:11.051 --> 05:14.575
General Moltmeyer was, he didn't mix well. He 
didn't have a engaging personality at all. He was

05:19.581 --> 05:26.329
just plain old

05:19.581 --> 05:26.329
devoted, I mean, Is there a stronger word than 
devoted or dedicated? You name it. That's what he

05:30.381 --> 05:33.504
was to his job. He literally lived, ate, slept his 
job.

05:43.833 --> 05:46.876
Did he have a sense of humor? Yeah, he did. As a 
matter of fact, I knew him personally. And we'd sit

05:49.959 --> 05:52.801
down, we'd laugh, and we'd make jokes. And we'd 
laugh about some of the things. He'd laugh about

05:54.703 --> 05:57.025
some of his problems. really. But when it got down 
to, you know, solving the problem or all, he's all

05:58.076 --> 06:01.842
business. He's all business. And particularly in 
staff meetings. He wouldn't prevent smoking in

06:08.551 --> 06:11.756
staff meetings. There's a lot of them like that. He 
drank very little.

06:18.125 --> 06:24.614
He was, he had an unusually good memory. He had 
Facts and figures at hand that would just astound

06:25.827 --> 06:29.914
you. To give you an example of how good he was, when 
General Ryan took over command of the Pacific Air

06:30.835 --> 06:46.722
Forces, see in effect, Seventh Air Force had a 
certain responsibility to him, but in a chain of

06:47.123 --> 06:57.318
command, and General Ryan was a very strong man, 
and of course was General Momar, extremely

06:47.123 --> 06:57.318
strong, strong will. And General Ryan and General 
Momar clashed immediately, and to the point

06:57.338 --> 07:11.118
where, through General Ryan's orders, Momar took 
a trip back to USAF headquarters. Really? Yes,

07:11.678 --> 07:12.039
sir. It is called by General McConnell. to report 
General McConnell. And talk about this? Yes, sir.

07:21.742 --> 07:25.366
And if I went back, you know, feeling ill, I'm going 
to be relieved. Was he? No. Matter of fact, to make a

07:27.668 --> 07:40.382
long story short, before General Mulmire left 
Washington, DC, he got clear up to the level and

07:27.668 --> 07:40.382
briefed President Roosevelt personally on the 
war. Johnson? Johnson. Johnson. I'm sorry. And

07:45.181 --> 07:48.764
went back to his job for the blessings of General 
McConnell. And General McConnell called General

07:48.784 --> 07:55.210
Ryan Person on the phone and said, Jack, you forget 
about General McConnell. He went over there and

07:55.230 --> 08:07.942
says, this is the first man I've ever seen that 
could out-talk and out-reason McNamara. No

08:07.962 --> 08:08.663
kidding? Yes, sir. He had more facts and figures 
and could talk statistics better than that.

08:15.738 --> 08:17.681
That's how good he was. Okay, let's talk about 
Mollmeyer's relations with Westmoreland. I'm

08:22.449 --> 08:24.793
sure you met Westmoreland a number of times. He and 
General Westmoreland had a very healthy respect

08:25.073 --> 08:31.944
for General Mollmeyer, and General Mollmeyer was 
instrumental. As a matter of fact, he and General

08:32.345 --> 08:35.650
Westmoreland were completely together on, you 
know, how to control SACS missions in South

08:36.389 --> 08:44.802
Vietnam, the giant strikes, you know, against the 
Viet Cong camps. So, and also, General

08:44.822 --> 09:00.485
Westmoreland and Ambassador Sullivan were, I 
don't think two people could be more hostile and

08:44.822 --> 09:00.485
hated each other more than those two did. And I 
actually used my headquarters one time for a

09:00.825 --> 09:05.232
meeting at directions of for

09:06.697 --> 09:14.908
their meeting about coordination of operations 
in Laos. They came to my headquarters. General

09:18.333 --> 09:26.704
Sullivan wouldn't permit him to come in Laos. 
Why'd they hate each other so much? Well, General

09:31.098 --> 09:36.046
Ed, well, to quote, I sat in on the meeting because I 
was the host, if you will. And General Mowmeyer, by

09:36.066 --> 09:42.396
the way, accompanied Admiral General 
Westmoreland and sat there. And

09:42.596 --> 09:49.086
it was obvious, you know, Mowmeyer said- When they 
met each other, would they shake hands? Oh, yeah.

09:49.587 --> 09:49.867
Oh, yeah. They were, you know, civil to each other. 
But when you get to the meeting and start talking

09:51.790 --> 09:56.157
about things, and this is where the- Recount the 
meeting. I'm going to do that.

10:02.401 --> 10:13.639
To make a long story short, they started arguing 
about

10:02.401 --> 10:13.639
General Westmoreland wanting to put forces into 
Laos. He had to expand the area against Viet Cong

10:13.999 --> 10:19.228
and hit the supply bases. See, he reasoned, like 
any general, you've got to hit him at his source and

10:19.248 --> 10:27.561
interdict his supply line. This got over into 
Laos.

10:31.358 --> 11:00.606
and said, well, there's certain things, you know, 
that I'm boss in Laos, and there's certain rules,

10:31.358 --> 11:00.606
you know, we've got to follow, and we don't want to 
spread this war, and then, you know, this got into

10:31.358 --> 11:00.606
really argument, and both were expounding their 
views and trying to settle a problem, and General

10:31.358 --> 11:00.606
Westmoreland said, well, I'm the commander over 
here, and I've got authority to do this." And

11:04.066 --> 11:12.118
Ambassador Sullivan says, well, I'm the 
commander and the boss in Laos and nobody does

11:04.066 --> 11:12.118
anything in Laos without my approval. Well, this 
is how. No kidding. And this just turned out to be an

11:13.620 --> 11:16.545
impasse and that's what left. Did they start 
shouting at each other? Oh yeah. They both got real

11:20.671 --> 11:22.494
heated. Oh yeah. Well, it was a very heated debate. 
But they left civility to one another, naturally.

11:33.733 --> 11:35.235
And they couldn't resolve the issue. No. It would 
go to a higher level anyway, didn't it? It did go up

11:38.379 --> 11:40.562
to a higher level, and that's the way it was 
resolved. And Sullivan won? Well, the decision

11:42.345 --> 11:49.836
was eventually to put forces into Laos after I went 
home. Yeah, later. Later. When Nixon became

11:51.558 --> 11:52.820
president. Nixon was president. As a matter of 
fact, General Stilwell at Matai was all for this

11:55.404 --> 11:59.770
idea, too. But, see, he was trained by General 
Westmoreland. At one time, he was chief of staff of

12:06.764 --> 12:14.635
Armed Forces South Vietnam under Westmoreland. 
And when this job came open in Thailand,

12:14.775 --> 12:23.207
Westmoreland sent him over there with the idea of 
controlling what's going on in Thailand also.

12:23.688 --> 12:26.211
Now, during this meeting, were they swearing at 
each other? No, no.

12:29.990 --> 12:31.532
And every once in a while. Did you have to cool them 
down? Oh, no. I didn't open my mouth in this

12:33.514 --> 12:36.797
meeting. I just provided my office, coffee, and a 
chair. And very highly entertained and amused.

12:46.347 --> 12:51.872
And once all over, of course, the gentleman 
O'Meara didn't pass. And I was escorting him to the

12:51.892 --> 12:53.314
airplane. And actually, we laughed and grinned 
about it. In front of Westmoreland you're

12:58.525 --> 13:02.030
laughing? Oh yeah. I think actually in, I think, 
well I actually think they shook hands and left.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.223
Sullivan and Westmoreland. And Spike and I, 
General O'Meara and I were laughing about it. And

13:15.868 --> 13:20.174
of course General O'Meara, you know he, General 
O'Meara supported General Westmoreland. So to

13:20.274 --> 13:26.302
get back to your basic question, in a lot of ways, 
see, Westmoreland and General O'Meara were in the

13:20.274 --> 13:26.302
same boat. So they got along okay. What was your 
opinion of Westmoreland? Very controversial

13:32.381 --> 13:35.064
figure in America at this time. I think he was a very 
egotistical

13:35.865 --> 13:52.444
person and vain type of a person, but I even think it 
turned out, you know, he had aspirations to be

13:35.865 --> 13:52.444
President of the United States. You think he did? 
Oh, yes.

13:57.109 --> 13:57.810
But, uh, I learned to know General Westmoreland in 
exercises in the United States way before he went

13:58.077 --> 14:19.021
over to Southeast Asia, and he was a very 
controversial man in those exercises about who

13:58.077 --> 14:19.021
would control the air transport in the landing 
zone of the Florida area of exercise, the Army or

13:58.077 --> 14:19.021
the Air Force. He was definitely an Army man, died 
in the World Army. all of the philosophy of the Air

14:24.790 --> 14:30.880
Force, particularly for close air support.

14:32.122 --> 14:39.635
He was instrumental in a lot in the Army getting on 
to their current helicopter combat operations.

14:39.655 --> 14:43.261
Do you think that he was a pompous man? He

14:45.224 --> 14:50.072
wasn't as pompous as

14:53.360 --> 14:56.805
For instance, the Ambassador Graham Martin. 
Okay, well we're going to get into him. Did he have a

15:00.590 --> 15:01.931
sense of humor? Oh, yeah. Westmoreland did? He was 
articulate, very articulate. He was

15:06.758 --> 15:10.803
strong-willed. He wasn't as quiet

15:22.773 --> 15:28.163
He mixed more easily with, he was more of a social 
man than Mowmire was. He was more of a diplomat. He

15:30.186 --> 15:31.689
had diplomacy. General Mowmire would never be a 
diplomat in the State Department. Never.

15:37.098 --> 15:38.781
Westmoreland could be a diplomat. He could be an 
ambassador. General Mowmire could.

15:47.356 --> 15:47.717
OK.

15:56.236 --> 16:02.463
Who was the ambassador in Thailand, later became 
the ambassador, and the last ambassador in

15:56.236 --> 16:02.463
Vietnam?

16:07.268 --> 16:14.356
Ambassador Grant Martin was a career diplomat and 
a very capable person, in my opinion. And you might

16:15.097 --> 16:23.847
say he was, I won't say he was a typical member of the 
State Department,

16:25.143 --> 16:28.367
Many people have a different idea of what a State 
Department man is. He was a good ambassador.

16:34.175 --> 16:36.318
He did wonders for Thailand. They loved him. He was 
really dedicated to his mission to help the Thais.

16:43.427 --> 16:45.911
And I agreed with everything he wanted to do. What 
did he want to do? He wanted to give the Thai Armed

16:47.513 --> 16:51.999
Forces more capability. He sincerely believed 
that there was encroachment of North Vietnamese

16:55.282 --> 17:01.872
insurgents across the border from Laos into 
Thailand. I agreed with him. He wanted to give the

17:06.159 --> 17:13.209
Thai air forces and the Thai police a capability 
with helicopters to combat them. He fought the

17:14.451 --> 17:24.006
certain elements of the, well, he fought McNamara 
primarily and his thoughts in Washington because

17:24.391 --> 17:41.895
McNamara primarily thought that the threat to 
Thailand was way under overdone by the Thais and

17:24.391 --> 17:41.895
their demand for military aid, and that 
Ambassador Martin supported them. Therefore, he

17:41.915 --> 17:42.977
didn't agree with it. It came so intense that

17:43.157 --> 17:51.529
Secretary McNamara would never come to Thailand. 
He wouldn't enter Thailand. Graham Martin didn't

17:52.927 --> 17:54.589
want him in Thailand. Matter of fact, whether 
Graham Martin had the authority to keep him from

17:55.030 --> 18:07.506
coming to Thailand, I don't know, but I know he 
never did come, and I know that's exactly the way

17:55.030 --> 18:07.506
the ambassador felt about him. There was extreme 
hostility there, and it showed in wires that I was

18:07.966 --> 18:15.716
privy to read that he sent back to Washington. 
Ambassador Martin, and perhaps rightly so, he

18:15.736 --> 18:22.545
felt he was the representative of the president He 
was not a representative of the State Department.

18:25.860 --> 18:33.290
He was a representative of the President, and he 
did what he thought the President would do in

18:25.860 --> 18:33.290
Thailand. This was not too apparent in the way 
Ambassador Sullivan felt.

18:43.384 --> 18:47.950
I guess Ambassador Sullivan didn't feel that 
strongly about his responsibility. He honored

18:47.970 --> 18:52.836
the Secretary of State, perhaps, let's say, 
That's the impression I got, much more so than did

18:53.137 --> 18:58.446
Ambassador Grant Martin. Now, I asked about 
pomposity, and you said Martin. Yes, he was. He was

19:01.592 --> 19:16.157
a, in my opinion, and I don't say this critically, 
but pompous describes his personality in a lot of

19:01.592 --> 19:16.157
cases, particularly when dealing with 
subordinates. I have observed him in the presence

19:16.795 --> 19:22.842
of the king and queen and the ministers and high 
officials of Thailand. And he was a very polite and

19:23.603 --> 19:39.943
courteous and, oh, not servile, but very proper, 
if you will, diplomat-wise, very proper. But to

19:39.963 --> 19:41.925
subordinate, definitely pompous. He, as much as 
he liked and respected me, and that man wrote wires

19:42.682 --> 19:52.016
on me recommending me for promotion on the spot. 
That's how much he admired me. No kidding? Yes,

19:53.838 --> 19:54.219
sir. Why? He admired me. Why? Because I supported 
him. In my respect to him as my boss, I supported

19:59.887 --> 20:04.674
him. I actually argued for some of his desires and 
ideas with my other bosses. He knew I was there. He

20:12.497 --> 20:13.919
trusted me completely. And one of my other bosses, 
like General Wilson, 13th Air Force Commander, I

20:15.140 --> 20:36.367
actually heard him say to General McConnell and to 
General Ryan, General Harris, the Pacific Air

20:15.140 --> 20:36.367
Force Commander, that this guy has got the 
ambassadors eating out of his hand. You did?

20:37.288 --> 20:37.688
That's what he said. He said that to me. I mean, he 
said that to them about me. He said, this guy,

20:41.660 --> 20:44.906
Charlie, he got these ambassadors. He handed his 
hand. Well, be that as it may, let's say I was just

20:46.589 --> 20:50.716
doing my job. But both Ambassador Sullivan and 
Ambassador Martin, I have to say I respect them

20:51.618 --> 20:59.652
because they They admired me and we established a 
rapport and friendship. Now there's something,

21:04.217 --> 21:08.304
the way they did and operate, I didn't agree with. 
Like what? I don't agree with the way,

21:09.285 --> 21:23.869
I don't agree with the way, the abruptness of 
Ambassador Grant Martin with his subordinates

21:09.285 --> 21:23.869
and staff. I don't think he knew how to handle 
people properly. At least he didn't handle them

21:28.420 --> 21:31.724
the way I would handle people. He

21:32.746 --> 21:37.692
was too jealous of his prerogatives. I feel, 
Terry, that a man that has authority, when he has to

21:38.894 --> 21:56.217
exercise it to get things done with people he's 
talking to, when he has to exercise his authority

21:38.894 --> 21:56.217
to get things done, then I don't consider this real 
leadership. And I take General Eisenhower. Oh,

22:03.101 --> 22:05.023
we're going to talk about leaders later. Okay. But 
I agree. I mean, I have read accounts of when Graham

22:07.445 --> 22:20.520
Martin was ambassador of Vietnam, written by his 
subordinates, and they bring out these things how

22:07.445 --> 22:20.520
they didn't like the man being his subordinate. I 
can understand that. You can understand. Okay,

22:22.862 --> 22:25.545
now let's compare Graham Martin with Bill 
Sullivan. Well, Graham Martin, of course, was a

22:25.913 --> 22:28.917
much older man. And

22:30.019 --> 22:38.732
in physical stature, he was a much taller man and 
looked more elderly. And in a lot of ways, the way he

22:39.393 --> 22:48.547
appeared, let's say, a little bit more 
statesman-like. Statesmanship, if you will.

22:51.772 --> 22:55.397
Ambassador Sullivan was a younger man, very 
ambitious. but equally as zealous of his

22:56.153 --> 23:02.361
authority as Ambassador Martin. Equally, both of 
them, very zealous of his authority. But so was

23:05.445 --> 23:17.981
Beaumont, so was Westmoreland, so was General 
Stilwell, and who knows, maybe Charlie Bond. But

23:18.142 --> 23:21.486
nevertheless, to answer your question, 
ambitious. He was extremely articulate.

23:33.229 --> 23:41.543
He was known for his sarcasm and his wires to 
Washington, D.C.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.334
It was strange the way why he did it, I don't know, 
but maybe it was a characteristic that identified

23:48.500 --> 23:55.992
him and separated him apart from other people. But 
many people talked about the characteristics of

23:56.032 --> 24:04.246
his cables going back to Washington. Very 
satirical or sarcastic or describing his

24:17.913 --> 24:23.160
Feelings about a problem or a relationship with 
other people. It's difficult for me to think right

24:23.460 --> 24:26.844
now of an example. How did he get along with other 
people? 7th Air Force staff hated his guts. As a

24:36.156 --> 24:40.281
matter of fact, they made a comment to me on one 
visit where I was trying to coordinate efforts.

24:40.301 --> 24:42.885
And I think I made the comment. And President 
General Lamar and his staff You see, I was

24:45.352 --> 24:48.996
responsible for General Momar as Water Sullivan. 
And I said to somebody, well, now you've got to put

24:49.056 --> 24:53.040
yourself in Ambassador Sullivan's position. 
He's got his responsibility. He's got to do

24:54.722 --> 24:58.346
certain things. And I think, sincerely, he 
realizes General Momar's responsibilities. And

25:02.090 --> 25:04.493
he recognizes them. What did Momar say to that? 
Momar didn't say anything. But one of his staff

25:08.297 --> 25:12.522
said, well, I'll tell you this. How did he put it? if

25:15.423 --> 25:24.916
we need more friends like him, I'd rather have 
enemies or something to that extent. That was

25:24.936 --> 25:28.260
indicative of how much they had a distaste for him. 
There's a staff for him. But this, again, was, you

25:30.182 --> 25:35.089
know, supporting Don Omar and what they knew of his 
function. These are understandable remarks for

25:35.109 --> 25:38.273
people who don't know the entire story. Sure. 
Sounds like you're balancing that because it took

25:39.355 --> 25:45.042
up most of your time. It did. That's the reason I was 
given the job. Okay, now did Rusk ever come over

25:49.407 --> 25:55.775
there, Dean Rusk, Secretary of State under 
Johnson? Did he ever come over? No. You never met

25:57.356 --> 25:57.997
him? I never met him in time. Okay, let's talk about 
a man who's very controversial, especially with

25:59.139 --> 26:05.747
the military, and that's Secretary of Defense 
McNamara. Oh, indeed, I can understand that. I've

26:08.310 --> 26:11.113
already told you a story about General Lamar. You 
already told me about him and McNamara, and you

26:11.701 --> 26:17.508
also told me that Graham Martin wouldn't even let 
him into the country. Did you ever meet McNamara?

26:25.697 --> 26:31.964
No, not to shake his hand or meet him in a social 
gathering, but I have seen him at a site. I only know

26:33.025 --> 26:35.768
him by what I by hearing him on TV or radio or by 
reading his wires or reading about him. Well, I'm

26:43.031 --> 26:51.039
sure that Momar must have had some words to you 
about McNamara.

26:53.181 --> 26:56.124
And Westmoreland, they must have made some 
comments about McNamara. I think General

26:56.324 --> 27:02.650
Westmoreland, if I remember correctly, I think 
General Westmoreland probably

27:08.401 --> 27:09.102
I'm not going to say. I don't know how General 
Westmoreland felt about McNamara, but General

27:09.182 --> 27:15.211
Momar- He never made a statement? Westmoreland 
never made a statement about McNamara? Not in my

27:17.774 --> 27:18.916
presence. Oh, okay. Oh, I've read a lot about him. 
Yeah, okay. But you want what I know. Yeah. What did

27:25.966 --> 27:28.269
Momar say in your presence? In my, best of my 
memory, Momar, well, I know he did not like

27:28.289 --> 27:35.519
McNamara.

27:37.122 --> 27:37.262
Mm-hmm. And- And you recall, I told you, he briefed 
McNamara. He went from McConnell to the JCS

27:41.424 --> 27:47.713
chairman to McNamara to President Johnson. And I 
think McNamara had respect for Omar. He must have

27:52.020 --> 27:53.722
after that meeting. But Spike didn't care for him. 
And for the reasons that you and I have read about

27:56.366 --> 28:01.314
McNamara. Secretary, and this again is my 
opinion, I've never met the man, but based on

28:06.147 --> 28:11.834
hearing other people talk who had been in meetings 
with him and knowing him and talking about him. I

28:11.854 --> 28:17.140
guess the best way to drive it, Secretary McNamara 
wasn't near as smart as he thought he was. And I

28:17.941 --> 28:21.646
think history proved that statement. And there 
again is a man that's put in charge of a job that goes

28:21.666 --> 28:30.737
out on his own without accepting the experience 
and know-how of people who've been in the business

28:31.612 --> 28:38.840
and made serious mistakes. I think that's very 
important. And I'll bet you, if you talked to

28:42.044 --> 28:45.488
Secretary McNamara today, I bet you he'd admit it. 
In other words, listening to people like Momar and

28:47.250 --> 28:59.164
other generals, it appeared that McNamara just 
didn't listen to the professionals in the

28:47.250 --> 28:59.164
service. Is that true? Anybody. He listened to 
anybody, in my opinion. And he certainly didn't

29:04.448 --> 29:08.492
take advice of the professionals in the field. 
Neither did his so-called whiz kid gang. There

29:12.657 --> 29:17.362
seems to be a lot of tension between the whiz kids 
and McNamara and the generals. Is that true? In

29:18.923 --> 29:19.944
those days, too. The way information's hefted 
down to me during those years, I bet it's true. And

29:28.073 --> 29:30.255
the things that you heard and the... read, you 
know, you reach much of it where the smoke is fire.

29:35.037 --> 29:36.159
It had to be there.

29:39.444 --> 29:57.711
There's no doubt Secretary McNamara had to be a 
very capable man as far as memory is concerned,

29:39.444 --> 29:57.711
analyzing a problem, and dedicated to his job, 
ability to absorb facts. I just think his biggest

29:58.467 --> 30:15.632
deficiency is that he just didn't accept the fact 
that experienced military men under him did know

29:58.467 --> 30:15.632
what was going on and actually were honest. 
Sometimes I must think he doubted the honesty of a

30:16.673 --> 30:22.602
lot of people under him.

30:28.049 --> 30:37.319
Did you ever receive a survey by a Brigadier 
General in the Army named Douglas Kinnard about

30:28.049 --> 30:37.319
your role in Southeast Asia? Kinnard? 
K-I-N-N-A-R-D.

30:42.524 --> 30:43.625
Ask me that question again. Did you ever receive a 
survey after you retired by a Brigadier General

30:43.685 --> 30:52.655
who served in Vietnam named Douglas Kinnard? 
There was another major... But you said about me.

30:55.977 --> 30:58.280
No, about America's role in Vietnam. Oh, no. I've 
heard the word, but no, I don't know. I don't think I

31:02.846 --> 31:03.688
have. Because this man wrote a book entitled The 
War Managers based on a number of generals who

31:04.088 --> 31:19.149
served in Vietnam and their answers to his long 
question here about what went wrong in Vietnam.

31:19.169 --> 31:20.350
And I was just wondering. No, I've never seen it. 
The big question here, of course, and this is a

31:21.232 --> 31:25.157
question for historians and military military 
professionals and for future planning is why did

31:25.492 --> 31:30.496
we lose that war? What's your opinion?

31:42.207 --> 31:53.777
Well, I can certainly understand the question and 
it rightfully should be asked.

31:57.605 --> 32:23.235
There's probably a lot of facts that I don't know 
that cause people at higher levels, and I'm

31:57.605 --> 32:23.235
talking about presidential and secretary 
levels, civilian,

31:57.605 --> 32:23.235
presidential and secretary levels in 
Washington, D.C.,

31:57.605 --> 32:23.235
that I don't know. I'm sure there are some things I 
don't know, many things. I've had enough

32:26.039 --> 32:50.697
experience in my Russian tour and my Southeast 
Asian tour in dealing with high level civilian

32:26.039 --> 32:50.697
authorities to know that there's things that are 
going on at higher levels that we at the lower

32:26.039 --> 32:50.697
levels never get word of. based on what I know and 
analysis and I've asked myself this question many

32:50.896 --> 33:19.080
many times and gone through a lot of soul touching 
about it and I think the best way to try to

32:50.896 --> 33:19.080
categorically answer your question is that had 
the had the

32:50.896 --> 33:19.080
will from the president right on down been made and 
existed that we're in a war and we're going to win it

33:21.473 --> 33:38.089
and I'm going to tell the military to win this war 
and let them go and do it, that war would have been

33:21.473 --> 33:38.089
over easily in six months. Easily in six months. 
This was not done. There may be a reason for it.

33:43.354 --> 33:50.181
Namely, maybe there was justification for fear of 
China. being brought in across into North Vietnam

33:50.583 --> 33:54.710
and broadening the war. Maybe there was 
justification for it. At my level, and as

33:57.836 --> 34:06.291
hindsight proves now, definitely there was none. 
I don't think China would have.

34:13.803 --> 34:19.390
And I'm sure at a presidential level, I've been in 
command position to know that you have

34:13.803 --> 34:19.390
responsibility. I'm sure that you have to 
consider that it's my job not to let this war

34:20.171 --> 34:25.138
spread. It's my job to keep my people from being 
killed and save lives as much as possible. But it

34:33.990 --> 34:38.055
must be also his responsibility to win that war and 
bring it to a close as soon as possible. I think this

34:42.545 --> 34:43.947
was a no-er. That's the best way I can 
categorically answer. So you put your

34:49.635 --> 34:53.401
responsibility on the politicians? I do, 
categorically. And it's one of the blackest spots

34:55.423 --> 34:59.509
on the history of this country in my life. Now watch 
your opinion. What do you think? that you could

35:05.542 --> 35:11.691
have done from Thailand, which would have 
expedited the victory? From Thailand, in my

35:11.711 --> 35:13.393
position? In your position. Practically 
nothing. But if I had been put in a position, let's

35:16.137 --> 35:31.219
say, higher up, maybe as Biden's President of the 
United States, let's say, as Secretary of

35:16.137 --> 35:31.219
Defense, or as Secretary of State, or as Chairman 
of the JCS. Then maybe you could have done

35:31.239 --> 35:33.141
something. I would have certainly recommended 
something. Okay, and as far as, but as far as

35:35.343 --> 35:45.116
Thailand, and as far as your job, your position in 
Thailand, you did everything, everything

35:35.343 --> 35:45.116
possible to win. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. 
Matter of fact. And there couldn't have been

35:48.721 --> 35:50.584
anything else more. I mean, you couldn't have done 
anything else, expand the effort or anything.

35:56.031 --> 36:01.418
There was no politicians holding you back, right?

36:01.438 --> 36:02.960
Politicians holding me back? No. No. No. OK, so you 
did everything possible. But if you're asked a

36:07.322 --> 36:17.577
question like this, if I violated instructions 
and scrambled, OK, I know you're not. Because some

36:17.597 --> 36:32.097
military men, like we just talked about, like 
Westmoreland, these people complained,

36:17.597 --> 36:32.097
especially after they came back to the United 
States, that they were not allowed to win the war.

36:35.553 --> 36:47.493
I did

36:35.553 --> 36:47.493
everything I could without violating orders.

36:48.054 --> 36:56.709
What were some of the orders that you would have 
liked to have seen withdrawn?

36:58.832 --> 37:01.577
I would have liked to have seen the Reins, 
R-E-I-N-S, taken off of air power. And General

37:07.128 --> 37:20.840
Mollmeyer given instructions to hit the enemy the 
way you think best to stop this supply of South

37:07.128 --> 37:20.840
Vietnam and stop this war. You go. That's the way 
I'd like to see it done. It would have been over in

37:25.584 --> 37:28.406
six months. What targets did Mollmeyer hit, then? 
He would have hit... uh well the uh obviously the

37:32.945 --> 38:01.602
dams for instance he had been turned loose on the 
dams he'd been turned loose on the uh haiphong port

37:32.945 --> 38:01.602
you know which we one president finally said hit it 
uh see we got close to using their power the way we

37:32.945 --> 38:01.602
should have used it he would have choked off the the 
railroad from china proper down into hanoi into

37:32.945 --> 38:01.602
north vietnam He would have completely 
interdicted the supply of North Vietnam, cut them

38:02.020 --> 38:17.809
off from the supply of all of their supporters, 
China, Russia, and whoever chipped stuff in from

38:02.020 --> 38:17.809
ports. As a matter of fact, you look back now, and 
it's been said by many who apparently know the

38:22.658 --> 38:33.430
facts better than I, that had we continued the B-52 
bombing of North Vietnam another few months, it

38:22.658 --> 38:33.430
would probably change the course of the entire 
war. Have you ever heard that? Yeah, I've heard

38:35.692 --> 38:36.814
that. Ain't no doubt in my mind it would have. 
Listen, as a supposition, it's hard to say. Well,

38:42.000 --> 38:47.526
we don't want to get into a probable debate here. I 
just wanted to know your opinion on that. Yes, sir.

38:51.717 --> 38:54.339
Could you all eat a bowl of chili with your 
sandwich, Jerry? Do you like chili? Sure, I'd love

38:55.040 --> 38:58.083
it. Oh, another thing. Let me tell you. I would have 
changed the rules of engagement to take off all of

39:00.365 --> 39:10.374
the restrictions for the fighter bombers. I 
quoted a couple of these to you. I would have given

39:13.196 --> 39:21.083
the Air Force much more freedom to hit the enemy no 
matter where they were in Laos. I would have given

39:21.620 --> 39:27.506
Westmoreland the right to send forces into Laos.

39:33.572 --> 39:40.019
I would have engaged forces and laid on an invasion 
plan of North Vietnam instead of fighting in South

39:33.572 --> 39:40.019
Vietnam in a jungle. That's what I would have done. 
Like MacArthur did in North Vietnam, I mean Korea.

39:45.024 --> 39:49.149
He invaded the place up there. How about the use of 
nuclear weapons?

39:59.639 --> 40:12.377
There wasn't a target in

39:59.639 --> 40:12.377
North Vietnam worthy of a nuclear weapon.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.203
Psychologically, I think it would have been 
abused.

40:21.790 --> 40:23.793
That, now, is one thing I would not agree to. Were I 
the president, I would never agree to use a nuclear

40:23.853 --> 40:27.638
weapon in North Vietnam. I mean in the Southeast 
Asia. Have you ever heard of this so-called

40:29.750 --> 40:32.333
McNamara Wall? Oh, yeah. I think I know what you're 
talking about. Deploying a wall of troops across

40:35.778 --> 40:41.126
from the coast over into Laos into Thailand? 
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I've heard of it. Most asinine thing

40:45.332 --> 40:47.114
I've ever heard in my life. Matter of fact, I'm not 
sure it's called a McNamara Wall. I think this was

40:51.120 --> 40:57.068
pushed to a certain extent by the Army in... forces 
of John Westmoreland. Okay.

41:05.606 --> 41:06.727
What did you think of it? You thought of it. Why? 
Why?

41:13.837 --> 41:22.309
I'm sure that had that been done, that, well, there 
wouldn't have been enough forces left to do any

41:13.837 --> 41:22.309
fighting in the jungle then. Plus the fact, once 
you see the area, I think you'd agree with me, Plus

41:27.102 --> 41:34.369
the fact that then, I guess, the North Vietnamese 
just went around the corner and flew Thailand. If

41:35.591 --> 41:38.153
necessary, it goes right through the border in 
Burma. There's not enough forces. That just

41:41.216 --> 41:43.439
reminds me of the marginal wall in France. OK. We 
all know how good that worked.

41:50.085 --> 41:52.688
Now, I think we've covered this job. of yours in 
Southeast Asia. Was there anything else before we

41:55.454 --> 42:03.983
used to talk about why you left?

42:04.343 --> 42:07.366
No, I think we spent enough time on it. OK, why did 
you leave? It was time to rotate me back home and

42:10.169 --> 42:16.856
give some more Air Force generals the experience 
I'd had. Matter of fact, I stayed over there a tour

42:17.497 --> 42:21.721
and a half. Really, I stayed over there.

42:26.047 --> 42:33.098
From January 1966 to July 1967, you were in 
Thailand. And in July 1967, you took on your last

42:33.118 --> 42:42.512
tour of duty to August 68 as the commander's 
headquarters 12th Air Force in Waco. Now, what

42:43.233 --> 42:48.882
were your feelings when you left Southeast Asia? 
Well, being a human being, I was glad to leave, get

42:49.334 --> 42:55.483
back home, and particularly get back to my family. 
I left with a great deal of pride in what I had

42:57.226 --> 43:02.414
accomplished. I felt that I had done, under the 
circumstances, quite frankly and not

43:02.614 --> 43:17.637
egotistically, I think I had done a better job than 
even General McConnell had asked me to do, when I

43:02.614 --> 43:17.637
think back. described my job to many general 
officers, my cohorts, and they, to them it's the

43:18.190 --> 43:28.044
most comical thing in the world, and I think, how in 
the world did you do it?

43:31.109 --> 43:32.431
I was proud of what I'd done. As a matter of fact, 
General McConnell subsequently gave me the

43:32.871 --> 43:46.611
Distinguished Service

43:32.871 --> 43:46.611
Medal, Air Force, for my

43:32.871 --> 43:46.611
job. God bless him. He awarded me for the job I did. 
He gave me my first Air Force command, 12th Air

43:49.504 --> 43:53.388
Force. Okay, now, when you came back from the 
Flying Tigers, you came back pretty much as a hero

43:53.408 --> 44:00.876
in America. When you came back from Vietnam, how 
did you come back? Oh, it's far different. I came

44:07.684 --> 44:09.966
back home and

44:15.970 --> 44:22.356
And I was on leave for about 30 days in the Dallas 
area. But it was considerably different. I was

44:24.818 --> 44:34.226
just another officer that had returned from 
Southeast Asian War and done my tour of duty.

44:34.327 --> 44:36.769
Let's move then into the 12th Air Force. 
Tremendous command responsibility. What was the

44:41.393 --> 44:45.977
size of the Air Force in Waco? The headquarters was 
probably around 300, 400 people, but my entire

44:46.227 --> 44:57.600
command was about, if I remember right, I think it 
was about 44,500 people. And it extended from the

44:58.682 --> 45:00.724
Mississippi. How many? 44,500. 44,000. And it 
extended over a geographical area from the

45:03.347 --> 45:11.256
Mississippi to California. And up as high as 
Mountain Home, Idaho. And of course, in effect, I

45:16.417 --> 45:27.190
had operational control, supervision, and 
training of all national guard and reserve air

45:16.417 --> 45:27.190
forces in that area, together with the regular 
forces. Fighters, reconnaissance, troop

45:27.210 --> 45:40.247
carrier,

45:27.210 --> 45:40.247
tactical air control type forces, all tactical 
air warfare type forces. The 12th Air Force was one

45:40.347 --> 45:44.432
of the two air forces in the United States under the 
Tactical Air Command. 12th and then the 9th Air

45:45.273 --> 45:49.748
Force and Shore Air Force Base.
