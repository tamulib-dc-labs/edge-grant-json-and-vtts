00:02.444 --> 00:07.073
It is Tuesday the 26th, testing, testing.

00:08.395 --> 00:11.641
This is Wade Birch, Director of Student Counseling Services.

00:15.408 --> 00:16.230
I was in error.

00:16.410 --> 00:19.355
It's the 27th, and we are in Henderson Hall.

00:21.079 --> 00:25.667
And I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with Wade Birch.

00:26.204 --> 00:39.940
the director of the Student Counseling Center for almost three decades and hope to record as much as possible about his experience in that very important task.

00:40.501 --> 00:45.547
Wade, please introduce yourself to the reader or the hearer of this material.

00:47.048 --> 00:51.013
Give us a biographical summary of background growing up,

00:50.993 --> 00:51.975
What did mom and dad do?

00:51.995 --> 00:53.377
Where did you go to high school, college?

00:53.657 --> 00:55.040
What did you do before you came here?

00:55.280 --> 00:55.641
Okay.

00:56.242 --> 01:06.919
Well, I was born in New York City and attended early elementary school in Queens, PS 134, which will get your loyal blood rolling.

01:08.301 --> 01:11.987
However, grew up most of my life out in suburban Long Island, Nassau County.

01:13.229 --> 01:17.997
Attended the University of Tampa in Florida where I was a history major.

01:18.382 --> 01:30.906
graduated from there in 1960, then went to Florida State University during the summers primarily and received a Master of Science degree in Counseling and Guidance.

01:31.561 --> 01:46.978
And then the other part of my academic training was a second master's degree at Indiana University in Educational Psychology in 1968, and then finally a Doctor of Education degree in Counseling and Guidance in 1970.

01:47.098 --> 01:49.140
Where'd you do that?

01:49.981 --> 01:50.922
Doctorate at Indiana?

01:51.022 --> 01:52.684
Yes, at Indiana University, right.

01:52.884 --> 02:01.534
And professional experience prior to coming had been, I was a junior high school teacher in Tampa, Florida, taught history, government, and geography.

02:02.037 --> 02:05.543
and at Stranahan High School in Fort Lauderdale.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.346
I was a high school counselor for two years.

02:08.467 --> 02:20.066
Then I was a graduate assistant at Indiana University in the Reading and Study Skills Center, and then finally moved over to work full-time in the counseling service at Indiana University.

02:21.949 --> 02:25.615
And is that where you were when you came here?

02:25.730 --> 02:29.016
No, I actually was at East Texas State University.

02:29.056 --> 02:43.239
John Koldis hired me out of Indiana University to become director of counseling at East Texas State University in Commerce, which is now Texas A&M University Commerce, which is very interesting because in retrospect I've worked for the A&M system for 30 years.

02:44.602 --> 02:49.510
So I met John in 1971 when he hired me.

02:50.114 --> 02:59.088
And he came to A&M in 1973, and I remember what a din it cast over all of us in student affairs when he left to come to A&M.

02:59.548 --> 03:04.937
We were not happy with A&M at that point, but understood his move and that kind of thing.

03:07.520 --> 03:12.428
Who contacted whom about the A&M position for you?

03:12.829 --> 03:14.451
John Koldis.

03:14.988 --> 03:22.822
discovered after he had been here for a while that A&M did not have much in the way of personal counseling for students.

03:23.964 --> 03:31.999
And he tried to get Austin Curley and the old Counseling and Testing Center in under Student Affairs.

03:32.119 --> 03:33.722
He had gone to President Williams,

03:34.411 --> 03:40.380
and proposed a reorganization of Student Affairs that would have included the Counseling and Testing Center.

03:40.981 --> 03:46.911
My understanding, and this is second hand, my understanding is that Mr. Curley wanted to remain in Academic Affairs.

03:48.413 --> 03:55.845
I would presume, A, because of the clout of Academic Affairs and probably the funding of Academic Affairs, and so that was not going to happen.

03:56.450 --> 04:04.503
And John told me then in a letter that he was actually spending time counseling students as a vice president.

04:04.563 --> 04:11.535
And he said, and while I think he was probably very naturally good at it, that was not why he was hired.

04:11.715 --> 04:18.306
So he asked me to author a proposal for the development of a personal counseling service.

04:18.775 --> 04:25.706
And I sent him about a 10-page document about a month and a half later, which he took to President Williams.

04:27.048 --> 04:38.306
And President Williams then agreed with the idea of setting up a companion counseling service alongside of the Counseling and Testing Center.

04:38.887 --> 04:42.994
I was then asked to come down and interview with President Williams.

04:43.632 --> 04:48.758
And before I came, John told me two things.

04:49.179 --> 04:50.340
One was to cut my hair.

04:50.380 --> 04:53.324
It was slightly halfway over my ears.

04:54.185 --> 04:59.151
And the other one was to not tell Dr. Williams that I had been through a divorce.

04:59.171 --> 05:00.653
And those were the two things.

05:00.693 --> 05:06.581
He said, once you get the position, he said, then, you know, you can do what you wish with your hair and that kind of thing.

05:06.601 --> 05:09.364
He said, but that will be appropriate.

05:09.545 --> 05:11.547
So I did so.

05:12.151 --> 05:17.837
I remember walking into what was the old administration building in the front of the campus.

05:18.818 --> 05:31.891
I remember setting foot in Dr. Williams' office and I can to this day feel the depth of the carpet in that office and the heavy wood furnishings.

05:32.772 --> 05:35.975
It clearly reeked of power.

05:36.656 --> 05:38.057
There was no question about it.

05:38.037 --> 05:42.444
Dr. Williams was very civil and kind.

05:43.826 --> 05:45.589
He was also very much to the point.

05:46.851 --> 05:49.455
I remember he said three things to me.

05:50.437 --> 05:53.722
He said, number one, if you don't like students, you shouldn't be at Texas A&M.

05:54.744 --> 05:57.548
And I had been in education all my life, so that was not a problem.

05:57.950 --> 06:02.722
He said, if you're anti-military, you would find it very difficult to be at A&M.

06:02.762 --> 06:06.771
Well, I was in ROTC and was not anti-military.

06:07.453 --> 06:12.465
And then the third thing he said sort of just to me revealed Dr. Williams'

06:13.407 --> 06:22.645
understandable lack of knowledge about college counseling because he said something to the effect of we do not want to turn Texas A&M University into a state mental health facility.

06:23.687 --> 06:28.235
And of course we, you know, institutions of higher education are not here for that purpose.

06:28.275 --> 06:32.083
The state has mental health centers, state mental hospitals, all of those other things.

06:32.123 --> 06:36.411
But he wanted to make those three points clear to me and he did.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.797
And it was probably a 15 or 20-minute conversation.

06:41.478 --> 06:43.159
And then John Koldis and I left.

06:43.439 --> 06:49.165
And shortly thereafter, I guess, John got the word from Dr. Williams that it was satisfactory that I'd be hired.

06:49.966 --> 06:51.808
And so that's the way that happened.

06:52.268 --> 06:54.570
As far as you're aware, there was no search committee.

06:55.231 --> 06:55.491
Right.

06:56.232 --> 06:57.914
And there was no advertisement.

06:58.134 --> 06:58.634
That's right.

06:58.815 --> 07:00.176
Was there even a job description?

07:01.377 --> 07:02.398
I don't recall one.

07:02.682 --> 07:09.229
I've talked to John about that and of course today it's very different.

07:09.650 --> 07:16.658
John's premise was that he had gone through a search for a counseling center director two years ago at East Texas State.

07:17.198 --> 07:23.045
He was very happy with me and the search that he had made therefore he saw no reason to go back and initiate another search.

07:23.085 --> 07:30.293
Now that would not fly today but in those days it did and so that was his response.

07:30.593 --> 07:33.417
In that conversation did you see any of the Williams humor?

07:34.999 --> 07:36.882
I honestly don't recall that.

07:36.942 --> 07:45.535
I remember him being very affable and it's amazing.

07:45.615 --> 07:56.230
I have frequently not felt totally comfortable around college presidents and I was aware of the enormous power that he had but he didn't seem to

07:56.750 --> 08:01.255
invoke it in any outward manifestations or anything.

08:01.875 --> 08:05.619
You were just aware that this was a man with a lot of power.

08:05.940 --> 08:10.304
But he did his best to make me feel very comfortable.

08:11.505 --> 08:20.975
And you had the impression that his mind was open when you went in the room as to whether or not you were the appropriate person.

08:21.396 --> 08:22.397
I really didn't know.

08:22.417 --> 08:25.440
I just presumed that

08:25.859 --> 08:44.127
Dr. Koldis had talked with Dr. Williams and they had had conversations and that sort of that groundwork was laid so that he was just interested in probably casting his eyes on me and seeing if I had just two eyes and one nose and two ears and that sort of thing and you know didn't behave oddly and that sort of thing.

08:44.287 --> 08:54.162
In some ways it may have been a pro forma interview but on the other hand I doubt that Dr. Williams ever engaged in things that didn't have meaning to them.

08:54.310 --> 08:57.534
And he didn't give you any directions, don't do this or don't do that?

08:57.614 --> 08:58.275
No, he did not.

08:58.876 --> 09:03.381
Other than that one thing of we don't want A&M turned into a state mental health facility.

09:03.922 --> 09:08.107
All right, and then about how long before you learned of the result?

09:08.908 --> 09:10.630
I don't remember the exact time.

09:10.710 --> 09:18.259
It was very shortly thereafter that John called me and said everything was fine, that he would have a letter of offer of the position.

09:18.579 --> 09:21.583
And as I reflect back,

09:22.036 --> 09:39.142
When John asked me to write the proposal that was shared with Dr. Williams, I remember John's letter said, I hope you understand the implications of this, meaning that if the proposal was agreed upon, that he would like me to come down and start the service.

09:39.162 --> 09:45.512
And the position that was offered you matched pretty well what you had described.

09:46.032 --> 09:46.373
Yes.

09:46.975 --> 09:47.556
Yes, it did.

09:48.118 --> 09:48.759
Very much so.

09:49.281 --> 09:49.943
Very much so.

09:49.963 --> 09:51.808
These will be the only dollar question.

09:51.928 --> 09:52.249
Okay.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.553
Beginning salary?

09:53.673 --> 09:53.994
Yes.

09:54.315 --> 09:54.676
How much?

09:55.618 --> 09:58.506
I earned $23,000 a year.

09:58.925 --> 10:05.933
And I was given two staff positions, actually three, and they were paid, I think, at 19.

10:06.934 --> 10:14.963
And the 23,000 was, compared to East Texas State, I think I was making about, oh, 18,500 or something.

10:14.983 --> 10:17.946
So this was an enormous windfall, just enormous.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.948
Where were you to be quartered?

10:21.250 --> 10:22.071
That was interesting.

10:22.691 --> 10:25.995
John's office was in the first floor of the YMCA building.

10:26.532 --> 10:32.058
I was sent up to the third floor of the YMCA building.

10:32.118 --> 10:40.168
Bob Melcher and some other people who were in student affairs were to evacuate the space on the third floor of the Y building so that we could have it.

10:40.608 --> 10:44.793
But I actually spent six weeks sitting in a conference room, in John's conference room.

10:45.454 --> 10:50.920
I brought with me a staff member that I had had at East Texas State who was a priest.

10:51.203 --> 11:02.428
Actually he had gotten his second doctoral degree up at East Texas State and so he joined me and then I inherited the assistant dean of women whose name was Tish Self, Dr. Patricia Self.

11:03.189 --> 11:07.238
And so the three of us for a while sat in that conference room

11:07.724 --> 11:35.039
organizing intake forms, you know, all kinds of demographic kinds of information forms, a lot of things that I'd used at Indiana and East Texas and massaged them and I remember the very first day we were on duty we had a student referred to us and Michael Jamel, Dr. Michael Jamel, the priest, actually counseled the students sitting on the stairs that led up to the third floor the building because we had no private offices.

11:35.199 --> 11:36.060
I got an office

11:36.563 --> 11:44.411
Six weeks after I came here and Michael and Patricia got an office about another four weeks after that.

11:45.392 --> 11:49.076
When I came here, I did not have a pencil, a paper clip, a secretary, anything.

11:49.597 --> 11:58.887
Ran into a wonderful young woman, 23 years old, extremely mature, 23 going on 40, who made my life just so much easier.

11:59.107 --> 11:59.888
It was really good.

12:00.475 --> 12:06.721
and describe the task as you perceived it and planned it at that time.

12:07.522 --> 12:12.667
Yeah, I ran into some interesting conversations.

12:15.169 --> 12:28.862
You know, being a psychologist, I'm very attuned to listening to people's humor because a lot of truth comes out in humor, and it's easier for people to say things that they wouldn't say in a very direct, serious tone.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.363
but it's more palatable through humor.

12:31.863 --> 12:48.663
And I remember one faculty member sort of intoning that, well, now that you psychologists are here, you're probably going to be recruiting all these crazy students to come to A&M, as if I were out on Texas Avenue Highway 6 saying, hey, come on, if you're a little off balance, come to A&M.

12:48.683 --> 12:51.366
You know, we need business, which, of course, was ridiculous.

12:52.287 --> 12:53.989
I do remember an ag professor.

12:54.391 --> 13:10.257
saying to me that he understood the work I did because he had a young man recently who was not doing well in some particular course and it was due to the fact that he'd broken up with his girlfriend and his concentration was impaired.

13:10.523 --> 13:18.736
And I kept waiting for something else, and it never came.

13:18.776 --> 13:24.505
And he described that as kind of weird, and I thought, that's mom and apple pie.

13:24.745 --> 13:26.187
So it was interesting.

13:26.227 --> 13:35.181
The other thing I used to hear bantered around when we got here, and people scratched their head about the three of us being here, was that Aggie women didn't get pregnant.

13:35.920 --> 13:43.877
So another thing that happened, John took me on the road to a number of Aggie clubs, and I described the counseling service.

13:44.679 --> 13:53.338
And I remember vividly one Aggie coming up and proudly showing me his hand that there was no Aggie ring on it.

13:53.875 --> 13:57.900
because women had been admitted, and by God, he was not going to be wearing the ring.

13:58.901 --> 14:05.830
And my honest reaction having a son and daughter was, geez, I want as good for my daughter as I want for my son.

14:05.870 --> 14:09.895
I didn't say anything, but that's, you know, I sort of looked strangely at him.

14:11.337 --> 14:12.419
It was very interesting.

14:12.699 --> 14:18.887
May I digress back to the interview part just for a moment?

14:19.127 --> 14:23.713
I was told a little about the conservatism of Texas A&M,

14:24.098 --> 14:37.045
When I had breaks in my interview process that John had me go through after seeing Dr. Williams, I remember one of the things I did in my free time was to stop any male that had a mustache or a beard.

14:37.717 --> 14:41.623
just to ask them how they were being treated and that kind of thing.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.887
And I actually got favorable responses.

14:43.947 --> 14:46.051
They said in essence nobody was hassling them.

14:46.351 --> 14:55.787
But it was my way of checking out just exactly how far does this conservatism go and was pleasantly relieved when I found that out.

14:58.211 --> 15:00.855
So going back to the original point,

15:01.561 --> 15:16.123
All of those little experiences sort of drove home to me that what we ought to be doing was to do our work very well and probably pretty quietly and just gradually become part of the environment.

15:16.764 --> 15:19.368
And that was essentially the modus operandi that we used.

15:20.450 --> 15:29.003
As you settled in, were there many opportunities where someone asked, what in the world are you all about?

15:29.860 --> 15:31.022
Oh, yeah.

15:31.122 --> 15:39.394
People have a... It's amazing the perceptions and misconceptions that people have of counseling services.

15:39.474 --> 15:48.687
I mean, all the way from they think you're going to be brought in a room and lay you down on a Freudian couch or use some kind of medication on you or something like that.

15:48.767 --> 15:52.893
And so there's so much to dispel, so many myths to dispel.

15:52.953 --> 15:59.563
Now, I will say this, the current generation, what I'm finding is in my professional life,

16:01.180 --> 16:08.452
Less and less do you have to dispel those myths because counseling is now so pervasive in our society and in the schools that it's not a big deal.

16:09.754 --> 16:16.304
But in the earlier days, you were constantly trying to say, this is kind of what happens in a counseling session.

16:17.346 --> 16:19.129
This is the kind of thing we talk about.

16:19.149 --> 16:22.414
This is what we expect of a client.

16:22.434 --> 16:24.357
This is what the client can expect of me.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.542
This is how we dress.

16:27.944 --> 16:34.671
a number of sessions, just explaining, trying to demystify the experience.

16:34.712 --> 16:45.283
That happened, and if it didn't happen, if I wasn't questioned about it, I would always address it in any presentation I made because I knew there were people in the audience who those thoughts were lurking.

16:46.805 --> 16:57.597
And you assumed that the primary kinds of services you were going to offer would include what?

16:58.167 --> 16:59.589
That was interesting.

17:00.691 --> 17:07.642
We had, as I mentioned, you had the Counseling and Testing Center, which I understand historically was established around 1960.

17:07.683 --> 17:20.884
I understand that it was an outgrowth of the fact that some faculty in the smaller colleges were a little bit upset, well more than upset, about undecided students who came to A&M or assigned faculty advisors

17:21.522 --> 17:30.512
And of course the preponderance of them would go to the larger colleges like engineering and agriculture and surprisingly they would wind up being agricultural and engineering majors.

17:30.572 --> 17:44.408
And so liberal arts was very uptight about that and so I understood in 1960 they decided to set up this neutral and also professionally prepared group of people to help students make a choice of major and that sort of thing.

17:44.388 --> 17:57.948
So that Counseling and Testing Center, when I came here as Director of the Personal Counseling Service, they retitled themselves the Academic Counseling Center, and we functioned side by side until 1982.

17:58.008 --> 18:01.814
I have just realized I lost the drift of your question.

18:01.854 --> 18:03.036
I got into so much detail.

18:03.256 --> 18:08.063
What you thought the primary... Oh, the primary, yeah.

18:08.083 --> 18:08.904
It was interesting.

18:09.165 --> 18:14.192
I presume because of our titles, and I went and met with Mr. Austin Curley, the Director,

18:14.712 --> 18:22.361
I presume that we would do strictly personal counseling and they would do strictly choice of major, choice of career, learning skills, testing.

18:23.162 --> 18:27.207
And when I met with Mr. Curley in his office, he sort of threw me a curve ball.

18:27.347 --> 18:28.789
I was surprised.

18:28.809 --> 18:29.429
He said, no.

18:29.469 --> 18:34.756
He said, I presume you'll be doing some career counseling and some of those kinds of things that we do over here.

18:35.376 --> 18:38.560
It's just that the source of the students, he thought, should be different.

18:38.793 --> 18:58.573
any referrals from academic affairs since he was in the division of academic affairs ought to go to the academic counseling center any referrals from student affairs student life or whatever the rest of you ought to come to the personal counseling service so that was a that was a conceptual thing that i was not prepared for and uh i i was a little relieved at it because

18:59.077 --> 19:02.521
Philosophically, I hate to dichotomize a student.

19:02.562 --> 19:10.892
That's why our current student counseling service, you can get learning skills help, choice of major, choice of career, personal counseling, and crisis intervention all in one place.

19:11.774 --> 19:20.545
And so this enabled us not to dichotomize a student, not to say, okay, now that we've talked about this relationship you've been in going amok,

19:21.048 --> 19:23.471
I understand you're having trouble choosing a major.

19:23.511 --> 19:24.712
I'm sorry, we can't talk to you.

19:24.732 --> 19:26.074
You've got to go over to that other center.

19:27.035 --> 19:30.479
So this allowed us not to have to do that, which was wonderful.

19:31.360 --> 19:41.751
Did John Koldis or anyone else give you any guidelines, any do's and don'ts, any advice as you were beginning?

19:42.893 --> 19:43.914
No, not really.

19:44.695 --> 19:49.300
John, I think John, because he'd worked with me for two years, knew that I was...

19:49.786 --> 19:57.014
a pretty prudent individual, not likely to go off in any odd tangents.

19:58.095 --> 20:05.423
John really was pretty much hands-off, but I think that's because he had worked with me for two years.

20:06.204 --> 20:13.532
Up at East Texas State, frankly, they had a center that needed healing and rehabilitating, and he saw the work that I did there.

20:14.120 --> 20:29.085
I mean, I'm sure that when I had meetings with him that he may have warned me about certain kinds of politics in the institution or certain sacred cows or certain things to be careful of, but that was not a focal point at all of our conversations.

20:29.125 --> 20:32.972
He really turned me loose to build a professional psychological service.

20:32.952 --> 20:37.043
Now, this is a real diversion.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.471
He didn't give me any information on this, and I don't know.

20:40.672 --> 20:42.597
I was among those who interviewed him.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.006
How did he and A&M link up?

20:46.046 --> 20:47.068
Do you have any idea?

20:47.189 --> 20:48.111
I don't.

20:48.352 --> 20:50.016
I understand.

20:51.852 --> 21:10.840
I understand that through meetings of like the Texas Association of College and University Student Personnel Administrators to CUSPA that John began having interaction with A&M people and apparently somehow his reputation and his personhood

21:11.545 --> 21:20.077
became known, and I think Jack Williams already knew who he was seeking out when he hired him.

21:20.097 --> 21:20.498
I think so.

21:20.518 --> 21:21.279
Because he had heard that.

21:21.499 --> 21:27.348
Because I and a few other skeptics are saying, golly, we can find somebody that's in a real university.

21:27.368 --> 21:28.069
Right, yeah.

21:28.089 --> 21:29.912
Why don't we go into little old East Texas State?

21:29.932 --> 21:31.774
Right, sure, sure.

21:32.776 --> 21:41.248
By the way, John, interestingly, I'm told that John's claim to fame at East Texas State, one of his claims to fame was that he designed a

21:41.228 --> 21:43.311
massive campus parking system.

21:43.391 --> 21:55.348
He was an instructor in the physical education department and or professor and and did a wonderful job and of course then his relationships with students caused him to be selected as dean of students and all that sort of thing.

21:55.608 --> 21:59.513
Describe John Koldis as a as a leader.

21:59.954 --> 22:01.176
Make believe that I didn't know him.

22:01.376 --> 22:01.797
Yeah.

22:01.817 --> 22:04.160
Personality and attitudes and values.

22:04.621 --> 22:09.227
An exceptionally extremely engaging individual.

22:09.899 --> 22:23.233
Someone who, while he would have a point of business to take care of, he would do it in an extremely affable manner.

22:25.396 --> 22:34.305
Really put a person at ease, but also you never forgot what his position was, etc.

22:34.365 --> 22:35.907
So it was an interesting kind of

22:36.224 --> 22:37.706
of balance that I saw.

22:37.767 --> 22:49.786
You never were lulled into that this was a casual coffee shop conversation you were having, but on the other hand, he was extremely attentive.

22:49.886 --> 22:52.090
I alluded before to the fact that

22:52.306 --> 22:56.090
that John would have made a master therapist.

22:56.171 --> 23:00.896
His listening skills and patience are exceptional.

23:03.820 --> 23:06.643
Did you ever see him lose that affability?

23:06.743 --> 23:07.043
Yes.

23:07.864 --> 23:09.727
I saw him lose it twice with me.

23:10.047 --> 23:14.012
I didn't think that was bad over 20 some odd years of working with him.

23:14.032 --> 23:14.953
Over what?

23:15.153 --> 23:20.980
One of them was that I quickly realized that our staff,

23:21.601 --> 23:33.399
were dealing with students who had problems of a psychiatric proportion and that we were getting into, very mixed up into suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and that.

23:34.300 --> 23:38.246
And I really saw the need for psychiatric backup or consultation.

23:39.167 --> 23:51.085
And at that time, I think it was pretty clear to me that John was tiptoeing into that area because it was one thing to bring psychologists to A&M,

23:52.128 --> 24:04.025
in my estimation, then if he were now quickly going to say, hey, we need some kind of psychiatric backup, that the administration might wonder, whoa, what kind of direction are we going in, you know, and that kind of thing.

24:04.786 --> 24:14.459
And so I got worried because it was a bunch of psychologists who were making decisions sometimes that were quasi-psychiatric medical decisions.

24:14.519 --> 24:20.127
And I thought that really set the staff up for liability, expressed that to John, asked for some part-time help,

24:20.663 --> 24:28.676
And John would say, well, something like, well, timing's not quite right, or this, that, and the other thing.

24:29.357 --> 24:32.322
And this would drag on into months and months and months.

24:32.422 --> 24:37.610
And we had a staff retreat once, right near lunchtime.

24:37.630 --> 24:40.875
And John said, well, are there any other issues anyone wants to throw out?

24:40.895 --> 24:42.638
And I said, yeah, John.

24:42.678 --> 24:47.025
I said, I'm still very anxious to get some psychiatric backup.

24:47.495 --> 24:50.900
And he came forth with, well, the timing isn't quite right.

24:50.940 --> 24:52.443
It was the same thing I'd been hearing.

24:53.364 --> 24:56.409
And I just lost it.

24:56.589 --> 25:03.761
And I blurted out, OK, I've kept my memos to you, meaning I've got in writing, there's a need.

25:03.801 --> 25:07.327
And if anybody kills himself, it's not going to come back on me.

25:07.367 --> 25:08.488
And he knew what I was saying.

25:09.250 --> 25:12.775
And he said something like, what the hell good is that going to do you?

25:12.795 --> 25:15.139
Or something like that just flashed a moment of anger.

25:15.457 --> 25:21.244
The meeting broke for lunch shortly thereafter and he came up to me in the lunch line and said, hey, he used to call me Wado.

25:21.305 --> 25:22.686
He said, Wado, I'm sorry.

25:22.706 --> 25:25.250
He said, I understand how critical this is to you.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.312
So it was a very, very quick thing.

25:27.773 --> 25:41.751
The other time that he got upset with me, we had a student, a male student client here that was somewhat psychologically unstable, but we had him...

25:42.170 --> 25:49.902
We had him in good control, and then we went into spring break and we lost contact with him for nine days, the weekend before and after spring break and that whole week.

25:50.503 --> 26:03.883
He proceeded to go into one of the female Corps residence rooms with rope and that, not with weapons, but with ropes and that, and barricaded himself in a room with two women.

26:04.985 --> 26:10.573
And, of course, interestingly, the women overpowered him.

26:11.110 --> 26:39.987
and later we John immediately debriefed with everyone involved and when it came my turn to talk I said well I said you know legally because I'm licensed by the state of Texas I can break confidentiality only with medical personnel and law enforcement personnel I said there was no reason to break any confidentiality with any medical authorities because it wasn't on medication or anything like that and and his behavior had

26:40.591 --> 26:56.862
previously been reported to police so you know there was there was really nothing that that I could have done more and he said something the effect of Wade if those two women had been killed you know

26:57.196 --> 27:03.906
what in the heck is all of that, you know, that professional law and all that, what good is all that stuff?

27:03.926 --> 27:08.674
You know, he was upset, understandably upset about the welfare of the women.

27:08.694 --> 27:14.643
Out of that actually came a very good policy and procedure where, that our staff still operates on here today.

27:15.164 --> 27:23.997
We strongly encourage, not require a student who's had made a threat made against them, to go to the vice president's office and report that to one member of that staff.

27:23.977 --> 27:30.483
they're not encumbered by the confidentiality laws and therefore they can set in motion a whole range of protective things.

27:30.583 --> 27:35.127
So those were the two times, the only two times that I can remember.

27:35.167 --> 27:46.077
The only other time I remember was once on a golf course at a division golf tournament where I was having a terrible, I was doing so badly that I was shooting worse than Malin Sutherland.

27:46.097 --> 27:51.942
And John knew I was frustrated and he came up to me in my face and quietly said,

27:52.732 --> 27:56.718
When my game starts going bad, the first thing I do is just slow everything down.

27:57.459 --> 27:59.502
And I looked at him and I said, uh-huh.

28:00.423 --> 28:02.766
And he knew I wasn't ready to receive anything.

28:02.846 --> 28:06.712
And he said, hey, you're nothing but a GD stubborn Yankee.

28:07.773 --> 28:11.418
You know, those are the only times I, but that was said in good humor.

28:12.600 --> 28:12.840
All right.

28:12.980 --> 28:17.927
As you, as you moved in to the quarter slowly.

28:18.108 --> 28:18.368
Yeah.

28:18.854 --> 28:22.681
Administratively, you reported directly to Koldis?

28:22.701 --> 28:23.422
To Koldis, yes.

28:23.483 --> 28:24.444
He was the vice president.

28:24.545 --> 28:24.825
Right.

28:25.086 --> 28:30.656
Describe the senior, who were the other senior people reporting to him?

28:31.197 --> 28:36.246
Oh, the first year I was here, Charles Powell was, I think they still had the dean of men.

28:36.687 --> 28:37.268
No, no.

28:37.248 --> 28:44.619
Now, one of the things when John Colas came here that he gave up were the Dean of Women and Dean of Men titles.

28:45.019 --> 28:50.668
Because I think, as I understood it, the Academic Affairs folks didn't like the idea of Dean titles being in Student Affairs.

28:50.688 --> 28:52.871
So I think that concession was made.

28:53.352 --> 28:59.701
But Charles Powell was the Director of Student Affairs, I think it was called at that time.

29:00.282 --> 29:02.345
Toby Reeves was the Assistant Director.

29:02.365 --> 29:03.947
She had been the Dean of Women.

29:03.927 --> 29:06.253
He had been the Dean of Men, I believe.

29:06.854 --> 29:08.237
So they were two of the principals.

29:08.859 --> 29:11.164
Wayne Stark was here as head of the MSC.

29:11.706 --> 29:15.996
I'm trying to think the University Police Department that we had in the division.

29:16.111 --> 29:23.803
I know Tom Parsons was one of the early ones, but I can't... No, it was another gentleman, a trained law enforcement officer.

29:24.805 --> 29:29.272
Gosh, I cannot recall his name, but very, very pleasant, very kind gentleman.

29:29.312 --> 29:29.793
He was there.

29:30.133 --> 29:34.360
Carolyn Adair was the Director of Student Activities, and she was fairly new at that position.

29:36.924 --> 29:42.793
Claude Goswick was the Director of the Student Health Service.

29:44.647 --> 29:50.555
What was, of that group, were they generally optimistic, pessimistic?

29:50.575 --> 29:57.906
Oh, with Coldest, you couldn't be, pessimism was not permitted, and I say that benignly.

29:58.947 --> 30:10.063
Carolyn Dare was extremely bubbly and effervescent, younger certainly than she is now, and full of energy, and Claude Goswick was very good to work with.

30:10.769 --> 30:13.495
Toby Reeves was very positive.

30:13.555 --> 30:29.267
No, it was an upbeat group, and John was really... I think John at that time was really trying to fashion a more professional student affairs group than had previously existed under General Hannigan, which had been more...

30:29.669 --> 30:34.036
I think quasi-military cronies who were put in certain, you know, offices.

30:34.316 --> 30:40.486
I remember seeing the Office of Civilian Student Activities and thought, boy, that's really different.

30:40.506 --> 30:45.755
You know, being at Florida State and Indiana, I'd never seen that designation, but I understood it in the context of A&M.

30:46.276 --> 30:55.170
But John really was, and I remember this, I remember that John, I don't know that he'd admit it,

30:55.606 --> 31:04.456
But I think he had to be somewhat stressed by the very delicate balance of hiring A&M people in student affairs versus outside people.

31:05.277 --> 31:18.571
And I know particularly in the residence halls, my impression was that there was a lot of pressure put on him to hire Aggies to keep, again, to keep the spirit going, not take any chances with that lapse.

31:18.591 --> 31:24.938
And I think John sort of did some Aggies and then he grabbed some outsiders and, you know, he sort of walked the line.

31:25.340 --> 31:28.689
And did those of you reporting to him, you all met once a week?

31:29.030 --> 31:31.938
Yes, once a week, just as we had when I was at East Texas State.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.884
He continued that tradition.

31:34.245 --> 31:40.041
And as you began, did you have some other institution as a model for...
