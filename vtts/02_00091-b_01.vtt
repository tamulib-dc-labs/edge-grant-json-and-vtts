WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:04.514
I really didn't know what was going on.

00:04.974 --> 00:07.919
I forget what my last words were.

00:07.940 --> 00:09.462
I don't want to hear them again.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.269
How well did you know the Williams at that point?

00:18.778 --> 00:25.650
Gee whiz, I knew Jack, of course.

00:27.098 --> 00:27.939
Moderately well.

00:28.199 --> 00:31.264
And your impressions of him in personality and sociology?

00:31.284 --> 00:33.747
Oh, I thought he was a wonderful person.

00:33.767 --> 00:34.248
Still do.

00:36.351 --> 00:37.452
Can't ever get over that.

00:37.913 --> 00:41.618
Did you know that he had any heart worries?

00:43.560 --> 00:43.721
No, no.

00:44.281 --> 00:50.710
Nor had he any history like what he was telling me about that day and what she described.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.412
It had never happened before.

00:52.432 --> 00:53.914
It was an arrhythmia.

00:53.934 --> 00:56.297
Describe that conversation.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.599
I had the same thing myself.

00:57.699 --> 00:59.701
I can tell you exactly how it feels.

00:59.721 --> 01:00.783
Describe the conversation.

01:02.044 --> 01:11.196
The conversation was such that we were sitting side by side on a sofa, and all of a sudden, and we were just talking about how he felt.

01:11.176 --> 01:16.484
And all of a sudden, he wasn't there.

01:16.504 --> 01:22.113
He was just like that, lost consciousness.

01:22.955 --> 01:25.238
And I had no idea what it was.

01:25.459 --> 01:29.525
We hadn't really gotten around to that, except I sort of guessed hard.

01:30.527 --> 01:35.935
And the first thing I thought of doing was just getting him on the chest.

01:35.915 --> 01:37.298
And I did exactly that.

01:37.639 --> 01:44.373
And when I did that, he came back and he was talking then as if nothing had ever happened.

01:45.796 --> 01:49.063
And that probably happened

01:50.663 --> 01:53.347
Two or three times.

01:54.168 --> 01:57.033
And all times I would give him the thump.

01:57.273 --> 01:57.894
That afternoon?

01:57.974 --> 01:58.655
That afternoon.

01:59.817 --> 02:03.222
And he would come to and he would be okay.

02:03.883 --> 02:13.497
And that's when I got on the phone and talked to Francis Goff at the health center and said, get some, get the ambulance over here, get some oxygen over in the meantime.

02:13.557 --> 02:18.004
And there was no 911 then and call,

02:17.984 --> 02:21.988
the ambulance, we want to go to the St.

02:22.008 --> 02:22.769
Joseph Hospital.

02:23.870 --> 02:29.477
And I'd forgotten that my car was parked out in the, in the Oval driveway.

02:29.517 --> 02:35.744
And when, consequently, when the ambulance came in, they came in behind my car.

02:36.805 --> 02:47.957
And when the, the, we were sitting there talking, it happened again, and Francis was on the way, and I hit him again.

02:49.203 --> 02:53.931
And he came to and I said, let's get out of here.

02:55.314 --> 02:59.822
And by this time, Francis had just walked in and I said, let's get out of here.

03:00.803 --> 03:03.909
And she understood what was going on.

03:04.450 --> 03:10.380
So we got him in the ambulance and all of a sudden the ambulance couldn't get out.

03:11.282 --> 03:13.185
You know, they didn't want to go across the grass.

03:16.473 --> 03:16.773
Excuse me.

03:17.734 --> 03:20.358
Margaret said, go right across that grass.

03:20.738 --> 03:23.902
And so they did in the ambulance and they made ruts that deep.

03:24.943 --> 03:25.744
I'll never forget that.

03:25.764 --> 03:28.708
I'm sure the grounds maintenance was mad at them for that.

03:30.189 --> 03:31.911
But then of course we brought him on over to St.

03:31.931 --> 03:32.652
Joseph Hospital.

03:32.933 --> 03:35.476
Then I saw very little of him after that.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.479
Nelda Green was over there.

03:38.499 --> 03:43.425
And I guess Nelda had brought Margaret.

03:43.405 --> 03:54.037
But I stayed over there for the whole afternoon because I remember when the helicopter, I was there when the helicopter took off with him going to Houston and it was dark.

03:58.461 --> 04:04.989
So I really don't know much about his course once we got him over there.

04:05.749 --> 04:07.311
I don't know who treated him.

04:09.714 --> 04:10.635
Who could it have been?

04:10.675 --> 04:12.737
Harry Lipscomb maybe?

04:13.375 --> 04:19.301
And as far as you know, what had he been doing before that afternoon immediately?

04:21.903 --> 04:24.346
Nothing that I don't remember.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.329
Certainly nothing exertional.

04:28.690 --> 04:36.037
I don't think he was under any greater emotional tension than usual.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.682
I do recall that Margaret

04:42.248 --> 04:44.711
blamed it on the board right at the very start.

04:46.573 --> 04:49.496
I must have known her well enough that she would say that to me.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.762
Because she was just fighting mad about that.

04:56.063 --> 05:01.029
And as you said, and I wasn't even aware, didn't get over it for a long, long time.

05:01.830 --> 05:06.695
And you didn't give him any medication?

05:06.715 --> 05:08.577
I didn't give him any medication, no.

05:09.130 --> 05:10.692
There was really nothing.

05:10.712 --> 05:11.993
I had nothing.

05:12.133 --> 05:19.061
I had my little black bag, which just had the basic stuff in there, and nothing else.

05:19.942 --> 05:25.547
I don't even recall that I had a chance.

05:25.568 --> 05:34.497
Well, I must have had a chance to take his blood pressure, at least when he was conscious right at first, although I don't remember it.

05:34.679 --> 05:37.663
When you all leave the house, he's unconscious?

05:37.763 --> 05:38.664
He's unconscious.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.268
We're doing CPR.

05:42.569 --> 06:00.653
Actually, that crossing the grass, if you will, was so rough that Francis held me while I did CPR on him when it was rough.

06:00.633 --> 06:04.637
than I held her when we alternated as we did.

06:04.997 --> 06:10.223
We didn't have to do the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation because we had the bag, the oxygen bag.

06:11.644 --> 06:12.565
Was he conscious?

06:13.126 --> 06:14.027
No, he wasn't conscious.

06:14.287 --> 06:15.288
Okay.

06:18.331 --> 06:22.736
Were you concerned that he had died?

06:22.756 --> 06:25.799
Or was it close?

06:27.380 --> 06:28.442
It was certainly close.

06:28.762 --> 06:29.863
It was certainly close.

06:30.282 --> 06:49.377
If in fact, he may very well have been dead with the very first episode, for all I know, if I hadn't been there.

06:49.397 --> 06:52.763
I was very fortunate to have been there and considered myself.

06:52.743 --> 06:58.450
I had a similar situation with that at the health center.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.353
I had a ventricular tachycardia.

07:02.274 --> 07:15.730
It had been a terribly rough day, a lot of emotional problems, and I remember getting up and from my desk and walking out to Patsy Luce's desk, she was the secretary,

07:16.722 --> 07:18.383
And I said, I feel faint.

07:18.884 --> 07:22.367
And I fainted into a chair beside her desk.

07:24.108 --> 07:30.614
And Peggy Shelton, I was unconscious of course.

07:31.915 --> 07:36.599
And Peggy Shelton came up and I was sort of leaning over.

07:36.659 --> 07:39.122
I don't remember it, they told me this.

07:39.602 --> 07:41.764
And she hit me in the chest with her knee.

07:42.565 --> 07:45.227
And that hurt too, afterward.

07:46.287 --> 08:04.488
But I remember coming too and from then I was perfectly conscious as a matter of fact so much so that they put me on a stretcher and with a sheet over me and they wanted to roll me through the waiting room and I didn't want to roll through the waiting room.

08:06.310 --> 08:11.036
So I said how am I going to do this situation?

08:11.416 --> 08:13.138
So I ended up covering my head up.

08:14.502 --> 08:22.896
And then I went through, so I don't know, I didn't see anybody, but I didn't want anybody to see me.

08:24.278 --> 08:25.801
You rode with to St.

08:26.081 --> 08:26.502
Joseph.

08:27.323 --> 08:27.564
Yes.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.727
In the current location, St.

08:29.767 --> 08:30.168
Joseph.

08:30.208 --> 08:31.711
In the current location, exactly.

08:32.111 --> 08:36.679
And you stayed with him, and who decided to call Houston?

08:37.857 --> 08:39.459
Was that you or?

08:40.221 --> 08:48.493
No, it wasn't me because I don't remember who was, I'm thinking maybe, I know Harry Lipscomb treated me.

08:51.357 --> 08:52.799
Dr. Williams is still unconscious.

08:53.020 --> 08:55.283
He's still unconscious as far as I know.

08:55.303 --> 09:00.250
Oh, I'm sure he had some external defibrillation, you know, the paddles.

09:00.711 --> 09:02.774
I'm sure he must have had that by that time.

09:03.295 --> 09:07.341
Do you remember who was on the, was there anybody particular on the helicopter from,

09:07.490 --> 09:08.814
It wasn't Red Duke, I presume.

09:08.895 --> 09:09.978
On the helicopter.

09:09.998 --> 09:11.644
No, no, it wasn't Red.

09:12.968 --> 09:14.975
And they flew him to where?

09:15.116 --> 09:15.658
To what?

09:15.678 --> 09:19.390
To, oh, where's the pad?

09:21.040 --> 09:22.563
He ended up at St.

09:22.623 --> 09:24.688
Luke's.

09:25.630 --> 09:39.420
But I think the helicopter pad in the trauma center, at least it is now I know, is in, what's the old hospital down there?

09:40.160 --> 09:40.741
With Herman.

09:41.202 --> 09:46.052
And this was what time of night when they left St.

09:46.073 --> 09:46.513
Joseph's?

09:46.534 --> 09:48.878
It was dark, I remember.

09:48.899 --> 09:54.811
I don't, I really don't remember the time.

09:55.352 --> 09:58.118
And Mrs. Williams, how did she get down there?

09:59.313 --> 10:00.054
I don't know.

10:00.114 --> 10:03.477
She may have gone on the helicopter.

10:03.657 --> 10:05.178
Through those three?

10:05.279 --> 10:11.885
Only thing, I remember that Nelda and I were left together and watching the helicopter disappear.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.308
Remember any conversation that the two of you had about it?

10:16.329 --> 10:16.609
No.

10:17.190 --> 10:17.890
No, I don't.

10:19.171 --> 10:20.072
It's a funny thing.

10:20.232 --> 10:26.198
I can see their car, Nelda driving their car.

10:28.338 --> 10:49.384
that new model Cadillac whatever it happened to be and I can see in my mind as vividly as I'm sitting here right now pulling into the garage at the president's house and seeing the lights of the car on the back wall of the garage and and that's my memories

10:50.410 --> 10:57.557
I stopped a little before that and after that, but I remember specifically that, and I don't know why I remember that.

10:58.638 --> 11:01.300
And he's down there in Houston about how long?

11:03.603 --> 11:05.605
Boy, he was down there I'm sure for weeks.

11:06.946 --> 11:09.508
And DeBakey gets involved, doesn't he?

11:09.528 --> 11:10.649
DeBakey got involved.

11:12.431 --> 11:19.658
In order to do his surgery, you know nowadays, of course, for so-called open-heart surgery,

11:19.638 --> 11:38.625
coronary artery surgery they don't they don't pack in ice they don't lower metabolism to the point that so what if the heart doesn't beat it's a bypass machine now but they did that for him and

11:40.107 --> 11:53.728
As far as I know, he never complained of frostbite or being cold, or it seemed to have any, but he was most certainly packed in the ice for the surgery and afterward, and nobody

11:54.738 --> 12:00.989
visitor wise or from up here to my knowledge maybe you saw him during that period of time.

12:02.992 --> 12:16.155
But as far as I know I was the first one to see him and it was because I was dumb enough to that we were down in Houston and I said well I'll just drop in and see Jack Williams and I did.

12:16.215 --> 12:17.978
Describe that please.

12:17.958 --> 12:24.587
I just simply told nurses or someone, whoever asked where he was, went there.

12:24.607 --> 12:26.650
This was when he was recovering now.

12:26.730 --> 12:28.772
He's in his private room.

12:30.054 --> 12:33.519
And I said, I'm Dr. Goswick.

12:34.440 --> 12:40.388
And I said, I treated Dr. Williams at A&M.

12:40.537 --> 12:48.829
You know, I presented it to them so matter-of-factly, and so this is the way it's going to be.

12:48.949 --> 12:50.131
I'd like to see them, you know.

12:50.872 --> 12:52.754
And so in they ushered me.

12:53.615 --> 12:55.238
And Margaret was the only one in there.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.242
And I stood at the foot of the bed.

12:58.222 --> 13:08.102
And Margaret said to Jack, Jack was a little bit groggy I think maybe as for instance he would be sleepy.

13:10.427 --> 13:15.657
But he also may have been sedated as well.

13:16.598 --> 13:22.085
pointed out to him that there I was, that I had saved his life, and that embarrassed me so much.

13:23.046 --> 13:24.388
Oh, that embarrassed me to death.

13:26.771 --> 13:30.836
But that is, that may be the reason.

13:31.156 --> 13:32.278
And then I came back.

13:34.300 --> 13:37.564
I realized that he was doing well, you know.

13:38.425 --> 13:40.768
Was he able to converse with you at all?

13:40.969 --> 13:43.292
Yes, yes, uh-huh.

13:43.492 --> 13:46.015
But in a sedative, sleepy sort of way.

13:46.737 --> 14:03.615
Um, and it may have been a combination, but I came back here and I told John at staff meeting, uh, I'm not sure John had his meetings on Wednesdays or Mondays, but in any case, the first staff meeting I went to, I hadn't told anybody.

14:04.136 --> 14:08.240
I told John, and Perry in particular, that I had gone to see Jack.

14:09.362 --> 14:13.386
And their mouths dropped open and they said, nobody goes to see him.

14:13.366 --> 14:23.480
I said, I stupidly went in, you know, and I just barged right in, and nobody got me by the shirt tail and pulled me out, so there I was.

14:25.483 --> 14:29.188
But that's really how it happened.

14:30.149 --> 14:35.516
Then when he came back home, did you see him pretty soon after that?

14:38.140 --> 14:41.044
I can't remember precisely when I saw him.

14:42.408 --> 14:43.450
But I'm sure I did.

14:48.059 --> 14:50.885
But I can't, I don't, I remember none of those details.

14:51.366 --> 14:54.592
All right, this is an editorial note to be added to this.

14:55.995 --> 15:04.011
Soon after Dr. Williams came back, and I believe before he officially was going to his office,

15:04.463 --> 15:08.991
My wife and I were invited over to their house on the campus, the president's house, for supper.

15:09.893 --> 15:10.774
Just the two of us.

15:11.495 --> 15:19.349
He greeted us at the front door and I think had on a guayabera shirt.

15:20.110 --> 15:26.742
And I thought that he looked thinner than he did before the surgery.

15:27.447 --> 15:36.659
And after we went in and congratulated him on his energy and his appearance and so forth, he asked, would you like to see my scar?

15:37.340 --> 15:49.837
And he then unbuttoned his shirt and I saw this very long scar that began right up near the base of his neck and went, I think, almost all the way down to the middle of his stomach, almost to his navel.

15:49.857 --> 15:51.379
Yeah.

15:51.399 --> 15:56.526
And he seemed to be pretty darn much like the Jack

15:56.860 --> 16:00.365
Williams that I had so admired before him.

16:00.385 --> 16:10.540
You know, it was a long time that he was, after he was in the ice, and I'm not sure how long after the surgery they kept him in the ice, that he was unconscious.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.524
Are you talking about days?

16:13.985 --> 16:15.467
Yeah, days, days.

16:17.610 --> 16:18.491
Maybe even more.

16:19.753 --> 16:25.922
And really, no one knew whether he was going to recover from the surgery or not.

16:25.902 --> 16:37.802
Now, I heard a, you know, this is 99th hand, that Dr. DeBakey one morning asked Mrs. Williams to sign a permission form

16:38.187 --> 16:43.995
for him to do some comparatively new surgery.

16:45.717 --> 16:49.442
And that she asked him, well, if she... Is this after the surgery?

16:49.602 --> 16:51.845
No, no, this is before the... Oh, okay.

16:52.827 --> 16:56.091
And that she said, well, if we don't do it, what are the choices?

16:56.632 --> 17:00.357
And what I heard was that Dr. Bakey said he may be dead by daylight.

17:00.958 --> 17:01.058
Yeah.

17:01.078 --> 17:04.903
And that then he was unconscious for...

17:05.474 --> 17:06.636
Maybe two or three weeks.

17:06.976 --> 17:08.839
Yes, yes, after that.

17:09.600 --> 17:13.124
And finally regained, so it's no wonder that he would have lost weight.

17:14.286 --> 17:30.908
All right, as you began then to have any contact with him after he, quote, recovers, did you see any difference in his personality, his energy?

17:32.575 --> 17:33.596
No, not really.

17:33.837 --> 17:35.098
No, no.

17:35.218 --> 17:41.626
Now, then I didn't continue to have really close contact with him after that.

17:42.948 --> 17:49.396
So perhaps it's not a completely fair judgment to make, but I didn't see any difference.

17:50.897 --> 17:53.841
And they then, after he became chancellor,

17:54.445 --> 17:59.610
They move over to the old board house and it burned.

18:00.171 --> 18:02.473
Did you ever get called over there?

18:02.533 --> 18:02.954
Never.

18:03.354 --> 18:08.919
Matter of fact, it had burned before June of 73.

18:08.940 --> 18:11.822
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:12.043 --> 18:13.424
You're talking about the old president's house.

18:13.444 --> 18:14.165
Old president's house.

18:14.185 --> 18:16.847
This old board house over north of Sabisa.

18:17.868 --> 18:21.432
And they were living downstairs and the NM Press was upstairs.

18:22.213 --> 18:24.435
And it burned while Jarvis was president

18:25.006 --> 18:29.632
and Dr. Williams was chancellor, the old board of directors house.

18:29.652 --> 18:31.674
Yes, I should remember that, shouldn't I?

18:32.795 --> 18:33.536
Where was that?

18:33.556 --> 18:36.440
I don't know.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.901
This is about 77 or 80.

18:38.362 --> 18:44.249
It had to be 80 because Jarvis was president when I got the former student's award.

18:44.629 --> 18:49.275
See, Jarvis becomes president in 77 through 80.

18:51.955 --> 18:56.726
All right, well, as you... I've got to remember a second fire, but I don't.

18:57.729 --> 19:06.229
All right, when Dr. Miller becomes president, did that have any effect on you and the health center?

19:07.051 --> 19:07.332
No.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.481
Did you have any interaction with the Millers?

19:10.881 --> 19:11.663
Much less.

19:11.903 --> 19:12.284
Some.

19:12.945 --> 19:14.287
Football games.

19:14.968 --> 19:18.714
Well, I think maybe a football game or two sitting in the booth.

19:20.256 --> 19:25.965
But bonfires, special occasions like that, yes.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.492
But that was, you know, just very social.

19:30.592 --> 19:32.755
Chuck Simpson is interim president.

19:33.296 --> 19:35.800
And then Frank Vandiver comes in 81.

19:35.780 --> 19:41.626
What about your interaction with Frank and his wife?

19:41.646 --> 19:57.403
Frank much more because of his bigger family and he they tended to call on me for things more illnesses and so forth and so on and I never minded.

19:58.524 --> 20:04.150
We did a little surgery on him I think I've mentioned in the

20:04.130 --> 20:19.774
treatment room in the health center incising the thrombosed hemorrhoids and I would go over there when Renee was ill and in bed.

20:19.794 --> 20:22.518
I treated the children.

20:23.660 --> 20:26.745
I'll never forget

20:28.362 --> 20:39.207
One of the younger boys, Rene's boy, he didn't like injections and he had to go to school and he had to get an injection.

20:39.247 --> 20:41.933
So they sent him over to the health center

20:45.102 --> 20:53.095
I'm sure they couldn't possibly have known that how he was going to act, but he ran away.

20:53.155 --> 20:57.642
And I went out with the syringe in my hand.

20:58.543 --> 21:01.508
I went out and sat on the front steps of the health center.

21:01.488 --> 21:09.158
And I looked, because I knew he was on the side of the house, and I'd look, and I'd see him out of the corner of my eyes.

21:09.258 --> 21:10.620
He'd stick his head out.

21:10.640 --> 21:14.045
Finally, he came out, and he let me give him the injection on the front steps.

21:15.367 --> 21:16.829
I forget his name.

21:17.389 --> 21:21.615
But I had had problems giving him injections, but I did that for them.

21:22.096 --> 21:24.319
And there were so many kids in the family then.

21:24.339 --> 21:26.922
And I...

21:28.724 --> 21:37.432
House calls to the Vandivers were a little bit closer together than anybody else's had been.

21:37.492 --> 21:42.957
Then he's followed by Bill Mobley?

21:44.438 --> 21:45.839
Yes, and I didn't even know him.

21:46.960 --> 21:53.106
Because, you see, a year after Jack had his heart problem, I had mine.

21:53.126 --> 21:58.090
In January of 88, I had mine.

21:58.880 --> 22:02.769
I had surgery and I have the scar to show for it.

22:02.830 --> 22:03.611
You said 88, you mean 78.

22:05.035 --> 22:05.797
Do I mean 78?

22:06.538 --> 22:08.824
No, I lost 10 years somewhere.

22:10.668 --> 22:13.014
When you had your heart problems?

22:13.034 --> 22:13.154
In 88.

22:13.174 --> 22:14.678
88, okay.

22:14.911 --> 22:16.113
Because that's when I retired.

22:16.194 --> 22:17.456
Oh, okay.

22:17.476 --> 22:18.679
I've lost 10 years there.

22:20.021 --> 22:20.863
All right.

22:20.883 --> 22:21.765
And I missed a flyer.

22:22.847 --> 22:23.488
Doggone it.

22:23.629 --> 22:26.795
We don't want to get to that at this point.

22:27.557 --> 22:34.050
Give some of the extreme experiences of all the years at the health center

22:34.672 --> 22:39.017
in some of the high points, low points, goofy things, serious things?

22:40.138 --> 22:43.581
Share some of the... Oh, let's see, goodness.

22:44.282 --> 22:54.193
Certainly one of the high points was the weekend of the dedication of the health center, the new... Well, actually it was a new party.

22:54.213 --> 22:58.317
There was no dedication of the add-on.

22:58.904 --> 23:07.749
when I got to meet Mrs. Boydle and her son, or at least one of her sons.

23:09.092 --> 23:12.542
And that, I think, is the first time I ever saw Jack.

23:14.530 --> 23:20.322
Maybe it wasn't the first time I ever saw him, but, you know, related to him in any way.

23:21.023 --> 23:31.464
I even, in my little acceptance speech, I even was describing the services that the health center was going to offer.

23:32.186 --> 23:35.172
And I said one of them was going to be obstetrics.

23:35.152 --> 23:41.719
And I immediately realized, I mean orthopedics, not obstetrics, and said that.

23:42.780 --> 23:54.572
And he got a kick out of it and sent me a note later on to the effect, the next week maybe, to the effect that I did that with great humor or something to that effect.

23:54.592 --> 23:56.675
It was a total accident.

23:57.796 --> 24:03.842
That was a memorable time, showing them around the health center and being so proud of it and the art exhibit and so forth.

24:05.324 --> 24:17.899
I was always proud of the new addition to the Health Center that I helped with and the fact, and this is something we didn't say anything about, that Bill Fife

24:18.352 --> 24:22.841
had his hyperbaric chamber down in the basement of the health center.

24:23.241 --> 24:30.736
We had space down there that we weren't using, had no plans for, and the biology department was kicking him out.

24:32.139 --> 24:35.605
And he had no place to go with the hyperbaric chamber.

24:36.167 --> 24:39.533
So I suggested that we put it in the health center.

24:39.513 --> 24:46.965
And then he used it for his experiments, not animal experiments, but human, you know, where people could go in there.

24:48.348 --> 24:56.140
And I forgot now what I was going to say.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.983
All right.

24:58.043 --> 25:02.691
With Jack Williams, we both share this deep respect for him and so forth.

25:03.352 --> 25:05.115
What was it about Williams that

25:05.686 --> 25:07.610
caused people to feel so positive?

25:07.631 --> 25:10.317
Why did you respect him so much?

25:10.597 --> 25:18.315
When he came to the health center, I would walk through the waiting area.

25:18.556 --> 25:20.140
The waiting area was in the very front.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.024
The students were all sitting there.

25:22.004 --> 25:27.834
And he would come, and it took me 10 minutes to get him through the waiting room.

25:27.854 --> 25:35.186
He would stop and speak with everybody, shake hands, smile, you know, from ear to ear, literally.

25:36.088 --> 25:41.918
And there was not a stranger in the group, and they all knew who he was, is.

25:42.358 --> 25:48.028
And those notes, those notes he would send that were truly personal,

25:48.447 --> 25:54.878
He would almost always send notes, and I never kept all of them, except there's some in those books.

25:55.379 --> 25:57.081
There's one of those books I put them in.

25:57.101 --> 26:07.459
As a matter of fact, I shared that with one of my sons when he started up his company and used them because I thought he could benefit by what Jack said.

26:08.601 --> 26:10.724
But anyway, you're welcome to read those.

26:10.744 --> 26:13.088
And Mrs. Williams and her personality.

26:13.861 --> 26:15.365
I loved her too.

26:16.950 --> 26:17.893
I loved her honesty.

26:19.076 --> 26:25.997
How should I say?

26:27.665 --> 26:30.972
I questioned the wisdom of her being so honest.

26:32.054 --> 26:32.615
Her candor.

26:32.916 --> 26:35.622
Her candor, to say the least.

26:37.345 --> 26:38.528
But I loved her for that.

26:39.570 --> 26:43.979
You were talking about some of the high points and proudest moments.

26:44.781 --> 26:48.829
The health center itself, the new building and the addition of the new building,

26:49.518 --> 26:56.730
My relationship with Frances Goff, the supervisor of marriages, was always good at tops.

26:57.371 --> 26:58.253
I could trust her.

26:58.313 --> 26:59.876
She could trust me.

27:01.679 --> 27:05.084
We, I guess you might say we had some secrets.

27:05.225 --> 27:11.295
I don't know what they were, but a wonderful relationship, work relationship with her.

27:12.577 --> 27:15.542
Fantastic work ethic.

27:18.526 --> 27:28.232
How often did a student and or a relative of a student ever come back and show any appreciation to the health center?

27:29.731 --> 27:34.336
I'd have to say honestly very seldom, but there were some.

27:35.358 --> 27:38.141
Certainly the mother who gave us the car.

27:38.622 --> 27:43.027
I don't remember ever seeing her, but she gave us the car.

27:45.610 --> 27:55.722
I think Francis probably heard more expressions of thanks than I did.

27:55.702 --> 28:06.876
I was sued one time while I was out there, and it's the only time ever in my life for that matter.

28:08.138 --> 28:18.030
A boy who developed an osteomyelitis because of an infection in his skin, Larry Coleman, our orthopedist, our consultant, was treating him at the time.

28:18.010 --> 28:30.501
And I don't blame Larry for it, but Larry was in effect responsible because I had tried to mention to him

28:32.050 --> 28:38.483
tactfully that this guy had this skin infection.

28:38.783 --> 28:54.514
We had a culture of a staphylococcus and that was a little bit of, and he had a fracture of, had had a compound fracture and had a fracture, it was his leg and that I was afraid of it and leery of it and

28:55.507 --> 29:00.177
it just sort of slipped by and didn't really get treated adequately.

29:01.159 --> 29:08.233
And so he was sued and so was I because I had part in his treatment.

29:09.445 --> 29:14.873
I think that, well, I know that the insurance company settled it.

29:15.173 --> 29:19.579
The state settled the thing.

29:20.761 --> 29:21.982
All right.

29:22.002 --> 29:33.478
Do you remember some situations where you all were very, very proud of the service you were able to render for this student in that situation?

29:35.181 --> 29:36.142
The way with the aides?

29:37.824 --> 29:38.305
Mm-hmm.

29:39.010 --> 29:42.234
Oh, you mean in the guy with osteomyelitis?

29:42.254 --> 29:43.676
Well, no, no, anything.

29:44.417 --> 29:45.658
Oh, gracious.

29:45.859 --> 29:51.826
I was extremely proud that we could do all that we did do.

29:54.209 --> 30:03.381
Since I worked in the treatment room a lot, suturing of lasperations and just simply being able to, with good nurses and good equipment,

30:03.361 --> 30:07.047
being able to do good jobs.

30:07.828 --> 30:16.441
And plastic, plastic in the sense of very meticulous work so that there's little or no scarring.

30:18.064 --> 30:20.227
Being able to do that kind of work on students.

30:21.088 --> 30:22.290
Gus, Gus.

30:23.132 --> 30:25.836
Were there any, did y'all ever recall?

30:25.856 --> 30:26.797
Bet you hate cats.

30:26.817 --> 30:29.942
Did y'all ever recall any of the goofy,

30:30.175 --> 30:35.868
excuses that students gave for how they had their problem, their injury?

30:37.932 --> 30:39.235
Surely there must have been some.

30:39.255 --> 30:43.645
Oh, there must have been thousands.

30:46.190 --> 30:49.295
And you know, Frances would know a lot more of those than I do.

30:49.335 --> 30:53.342
Frances, incidentally, has Parkinson's disease now.

30:54.183 --> 31:01.395
And I think her memory is not nearly as good as it has been.

31:01.415 --> 31:05.401
I would even suggest that you might even want to talk with her.

31:05.802 --> 31:07.304
You say, maybe I could?

31:07.324 --> 31:12.012
I would suggest that, but I don't know how she...

31:11.992 --> 31:14.620
Her memory is not too good.

31:15.222 --> 31:23.588
For example, did illnesses and injuries increase as final exams approached?
