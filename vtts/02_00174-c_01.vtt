WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:21.712
I went to class that afternoon with a Western shirt 
on that I had cut the sleeves out of because, you

00:03.035 --> 00:21.712
know, working in the oil field while I was bustled 
up and everything and had on a pair of Levi's and

00:03.035 --> 00:21.712
boots, Western boots. And we had the first hour. 
Everything went along just fine and took our

00:26.676 --> 00:30.780
break. in this was in a little anatomy building out

00:32.077 --> 00:42.103
behind the

00:44.750 --> 00:49.455
TTI, I don't know if you know which building I'm 
referring to. Over on the main campus. Yeah, it's

00:51.357 --> 00:57.484
on the main campus there between Zachary and TTI, 
that little building. And so we were on the second

00:58.365 --> 01:01.809
floor of that for that lab. And so we went out in the 
hall to take our break. And he joined in, which was

01:05.794 --> 01:13.963
very commonplace among several of the faculty. 
that was a part of the routine that they join the

01:14.213 --> 01:43.933
students in the hall in a very unobtrusive manner 
but still interact and get to know students and so

01:14.213 --> 01:43.933
first thing I knew in that hall here was this man 
standing right at me you know I mean he was up about

01:14.213 --> 01:43.933
like this and he was looked and he touched my shirt 
some way And I got, and he,

01:45.027 --> 02:00.649
I don't remember exactly what he said, but, in 
words, but what he communicated was, you're not

01:45.027 --> 02:00.649
dressed right, and I don't want to see you this way 
again. So he didn't. But he didn't have to make a big

02:04.295 --> 02:13.568
thing of it, but he made his way through all, I mean, 
he didn't just slug me out. He... dressed up the

02:15.250 --> 02:20.977
whole class within that first week. The first 
week, we covered subject matter, but he also kind

02:20.997 --> 02:33.672
of set the tone for us going through school as to the 
way that he expected. His unforgettable speech

02:33.692 --> 02:38.537
was the first day of a class, of a course? Yes. And 
what was the course? Well, it was the, we had one

02:40.520 --> 02:45.105
lecture and 12 hours of lab in the gross anatomy for 
the fall semester. We're all 64 in that. They all

02:56.518 --> 02:59.081
heard it from him. In lecture. That was the 
baptism. Yeah. OK. And then

03:05.369 --> 03:14.620
what were some other important first year 
courses, experiences?

03:17.367 --> 03:31.999
Well, he had Raymond Reiser for biochemistry, an 
extremely knowledgeable man, but not a very

03:17.367 --> 03:31.999
effective

03:17.367 --> 03:31.999
teacher at the undergraduate level. I had him 
later in a graduate course and found him to be at

03:32.039 --> 03:38.905
that was his level. He was a graduate teacher. He 
was from arts and sciences. Was he full time in the

03:43.889 --> 03:46.492
vet school then? No. See, we also had Harry Kunkel. 
They were both from agriculture. Biochemistry

03:54.181 --> 03:58.645
was in agriculture at that time. And as it turns 
out, see, Harry Kunkel is one of the teachers

03:59.065 --> 04:14.219
that's pretty high on, you know, he's pretty high 
on the pinnacle in my view. Now, what was special

04:15.580 --> 04:17.682
about his teachings? Well, he was very well 
informed and very interested in new things, new

04:18.877 --> 04:30.974
information. And a

04:32.155 --> 04:43.471
good lecturer, very well organized in the way he 
presented his subject matter. He presented a very

04:43.511 --> 04:48.057
complex subject matter in a very clear way. And of 
course, one of the ways that he endeared himself to

04:48.661 --> 05:06.863
my class, well, to me, and I think most, if not all, 
of my class was that he clarified Dr. Reiser's

04:48.661 --> 05:06.863
lectures

04:48.661 --> 05:06.863
to us. Did you all have nicknames for Kunkel and 
Reiser? Because over on the other campus, Uncle

05:13.070 --> 05:16.474
Kunkel's Mystery Hour. was the course he taught. 
And I've never heard one for Riser. I don't

05:23.001 --> 05:32.171
remember a nickname, but he was a source of great 
frustration to us. He would try to do things, you

05:34.113 --> 05:46.545
know, there were things that were thought to be 
important to teach beginning biochemistry

05:34.113 --> 05:46.545
students that were way long since uh uh he he had 
long since gotten away from that like telling

05:47.977 --> 06:11.436
enantiomorphs two chemicals and that are almost 
mirror images of each other well that i guess are

05:47.977 --> 06:11.436
mirror images and uh he He just bum-puzzled us with 
that, with his illustrations. He was like physics

06:18.103 --> 06:36.585
potter in that he would go to great lengths to

06:18.103 --> 06:36.585
devote a lot of thought to how he was going to 
approach explaining this so that we would know or

06:18.103 --> 06:36.585
it would be understanding to us, and yet we just 
couldn't get it. Were you all aware that he was

06:36.765 --> 06:38.407
Jewish? Yeah. Did that matter? I don't think, it 
may have to some, but I don't think so. You were in

06:46.800 --> 06:52.886
class or lab all day, five and a half days, did you 
all have Saturday classes too? Yeah. Five and a

06:53.646 --> 06:54.527
half days? It's pretty full, see Benny Kemp was a 
lab instructor in biochemistry, so he was working

06:56.409 --> 07:08.980
on his PhD at that time, and Benny helped 
tremendously with to fill in the gaps for us with

07:09.770 --> 07:13.176
the Bible camp. Now, you all refer to yourselves as 
first year vet students? Yeah. You didn't say

07:18.886 --> 07:19.848
freshman? Uh-uh. First year. And did you all begin 
to refer to yourselves as we're in the vet class of

07:28.855 --> 07:29.356
50? 57. Is that right? Okay, that's right. And so 
two years of pre-vet, normally, and then? Four

07:38.026 --> 07:39.568
years. Four, okay.

07:44.014 --> 07:45.475
That first year, where were you living? I lived on 
campus in the core area. We had a dorm, we were in

07:50.682 --> 07:53.305
dorm two. Were you still in the core? No. So you ate 
in... We ate in Duncan Hall. Duncan, in civilian

08:03.374 --> 08:05.617
outfits. Yeah. And you were free of all of that. 
Mm-hmm. And how did you feel about that, about

08:10.845 --> 08:14.050
being free of the court? Yeah, it was a good feeling 
just to watch them fall out. Usually,

08:21.921 --> 08:28.090
like for lunch, we were... typically we would get 
there after they had marched in. And as you look

08:34.509 --> 08:48.409
back that lecture from Dr. Price and that course, 
what were some other important experiences that

08:34.509 --> 08:48.409
first year for you as a future veterinarian?

08:54.999 --> 08:57.823
Well,

08:59.423 --> 09:29.194
I think the animal

08:59.423 --> 09:29.194
nutrition course that Harry Kunkel taught was

08:59.423 --> 09:29.194
very, well it excited me because this was, to me 
this was very detailed, involved information.

09:29.933 --> 09:39.587
But it was a clear advancement of information 
about animals that I had not known. And I thought,

09:39.667 --> 09:44.554
well, this is what vet school is going to be about 
when I get beyond these basics. And

09:46.257 --> 09:57.493
so that was a very important positive

09:46.257 --> 09:57.493
development. Now, in the spring, we had large 
animal gross anatomy, and that was taught by a man

09:57.946 --> 10:15.128
by the name of Gibbs, Leon Gibbs, who later fell 
into, had some disciplinary difficulties.

10:17.892 --> 10:22.117
And he was in the same department. Of course, the 
Department of Veterinary Anatomy consisted of

10:22.137 --> 10:26.603
Dr. Miliff Head, Al Price and Leon Gibbs and Al 
Price was obviously the fair-haired boy and Leon

10:27.241 --> 10:50.363
just was not oriented he was not an outgoing sort of 
a person and

10:27.241 --> 10:50.363
so he wound up being kind of the the black sheep of 
the faculty at least from our experience and

10:52.216 --> 11:22.071
students tried to play pranks you know to catch him 
you know for example when we were see we dissected

10:52.216 --> 11:22.071
equine cadavers and the students would different 
groups of course you know each each of us were

10:52.216 --> 11:22.071
assigned to a group that had a particular cadaver 
and during the first half of the semester well

11:22.473 --> 11:48.447
these would be suspended by chain or heavy rope 
from the ceiling and they were standing there and

11:22.473 --> 11:48.447
so we did a great deal of the dissection of the 
standing animal and students would go to very

11:22.473 --> 11:48.447
elaborate means to put a nerve inside of artery or 
something like that and if we found a parasite in

11:49.675 --> 12:11.548
the digestive tract we'll take that out and put it 
in the heart and then call him over and want to know

11:49.675 --> 12:11.548
you know very innocently well what's this so it 
just just uh bedeviled the poor man. Did he ever

12:14.185 --> 12:18.110
fall prey to those? Did he ever believe? Well, 
sometimes it would just about get him in. There

12:26.361 --> 12:40.540
were the most flagrant and the one that really just 
we didn't know there for a week or two whether any of

12:26.361 --> 12:40.540
us were going to pass the course. that were in that 
section, but one of our classmates, and he's a

12:41.752 --> 13:10.695
friend of mine, lives in Kerrville now, retired 
there,

12:41.752 --> 13:10.695
and he, after we had, this was pretty far into the 
semester, and his horse was a gelding, and so he cut

12:41.752 --> 13:10.695
the penis off, this particular day and then went 
over to a neighboring one that was a mare and it was

13:12.312 --> 13:41.509
quite a chore but he stuffed that into the tract of 
the mare and left it there till

13:12.312 --> 13:41.509
I think another it was another lab and he he got the 
students to that had that and maybe he was over

13:42.012 --> 14:09.758
there and he yeah I think that's the way it was he 
they were all milling around and he called held up

13:42.012 --> 14:09.758
his hand Dr. Gibbs would you come over and help us 
with this we can't figure out what this is right

13:42.012 --> 14:09.758
here and so Dr. Gibbs pulled that out you know and it 
just caught him you know and went all over him it

13:42.012 --> 14:09.758
wasn't that bad a thing but it He was really, really 
angry. And he was an individual who got very red.

14:20.797 --> 14:23.740
When he got angry, he got red in the face. And he 
really got, and he just left and didn't come back in

14:23.900 --> 14:30.447
for the lab. That, how academically demanding was 
that first year of vet school compared to what

14:31.388 --> 14:40.217
you'd had before?

14:43.117 --> 14:57.531
Well, it was, for me, it was easier than the, well, 
that summer with inorganic chemistry because of

14:43.117 --> 14:57.531
the time crunch. And then in the sophomore year, I 
did well in organic chemistry and made B's in

14:57.551 --> 15:12.465
physics, but I made a B and an A in organic, the two 
courses. But I really had to work at them. And that

15:17.612 --> 15:24.445
was just a matter of disciplining yourself to work 
on something that really wasn't your primary

15:17.612 --> 15:24.445
interest. But this stuff, you know, these things 
were all really quite interesting. And I found

15:29.234 --> 15:32.801
them to be. Based on what you now know,

15:37.420 --> 15:41.708
How would you rate the quality of the instruction 
that first year? Was it up to date for that era?

15:45.394 --> 15:45.715
Yeah. What about the applied compared to the 
theoretical?

15:55.031 --> 15:57.235
Did it have an appropriate blend of those two? 
Yeah.

16:02.868 --> 16:19.756
Not to the extent that the students receive now, 
but I thought there was enough applied in it to

16:02.868 --> 16:19.756
serve as a teaser just to kind of keep your interest 
up. But there still was just a tremendous amount.

16:23.081 --> 16:26.547
We were expected to learn so much more anatomy so 
many more terms than they are now they they just

16:27.202 --> 16:56.500
don't worry that much with with total 
comprehensive anatomy they'll like you know

16:27.202 --> 16:56.500
around a joint they don't we had to know we were 
expected to know any and every structure now that

16:27.202 --> 16:56.500
was an impossibility but still that was the 
challenge to us and we were given access to all of

16:57.813 --> 17:01.377
that information. Now the point will be that this 
is the

17:01.878 --> 17:19.338
knee joint or the stifle joint, and these are the 
important structures you should know about, and

17:01.878 --> 17:19.338
so that's the approach that's used. As far as you 
could tell at that time and in looking back, Was

17:25.218 --> 17:32.389
there any attempt to intimidate y'all, like the 
old thing, look on left and right, that they used to

17:25.218 --> 17:32.389
do with fish? Left and right, one of you's not going 
to be here three years from now. Was there any of

17:35.854 --> 17:38.317
that in vet school? Or did you feel they were 
encouraging all of you? Dr. Turk would do this

17:42.744 --> 17:48.733
occasionally, but he wasn't serious about it. Did 
you have him as a freshman? No. No. So you were

17:52.505 --> 17:55.950
encouraged. Was there any effort to emphasize 
small animal, large animal, applied or

17:57.312 --> 18:07.226
theoretical? Not until you got... The emphasis 
the first three years was in total veterinary

18:11.993 --> 18:18.042
education. And the goal... The goal of that 
faculty was to educate an individual to be as

18:21.125 --> 18:38.357
well-rounded a veterinarian as possible with no 
deficiencies, no areas of glaring deficiency.

18:38.877 --> 18:58.017
and the expectation was that the individual would 
be functional

18:38.877 --> 18:58.017
in both in treating both pets and livestock

18:38.877 --> 18:58.017
but would acquire the real finesse and so on after 
graduation. And you continued to think of a large

19:04.910 --> 19:12.179
animal as your goal?

19:15.903 --> 19:28.999
Well, no, I did until I worked after, in a practice, 
but after my third year in vet school and before my

19:29.907 --> 19:56.809
senior year but you know that was a large fire 
engine practice as i call it and as many of them were

19:29.907 --> 19:56.809
and uh

19:29.907 --> 19:56.809
i saw the the not so fun side of livestock working 
with livestock right uh but back at the at the vet

19:29.907 --> 19:56.809
school as far as y'all knew they hoped everybody 
would would survive academically and there was

19:57.143 --> 20:24.602
encouragement there was positive encouragement

19:57.143 --> 20:24.602
generalize about your class where were they from 
what were their family background

19:57.143 --> 20:24.602
geographically their attitudes their values

19:57.143 --> 20:24.602
well we had uh

20:27.873 --> 20:34.462
The majority of my class was from smaller towns. In 
Texas? In Texas. We had a cluster of probably on the

20:38.186 --> 20:49.521
order of eight to ten Houstonians in the class.

20:53.026 --> 20:54.488
First generation college students? Well, a lot of 
of particularly the ones from smaller towns was

20:58.855 --> 21:05.404
the case. There were a number of first generation 
type. Now we did, in our class we had five or six

21:10.071 --> 21:22.408
older, somewhat older students who were 25

21:10.071 --> 21:22.408
to 35 years of age. And some of them had been in the 
service before, and there were various reasons, I

21:27.492 --> 21:36.926
guess, for their coming on when they did. We had 
several from the class before us. That is, they

21:40.772 --> 21:43.717
spent three years in pre-vet.

21:48.864 --> 21:53.972
But I would say at least half of the class was a 
two-year had gone through two-year pre-vet?

21:56.718 --> 21:59.861
About how many of them were farmer ranch boys in 
background? Oh,

22:00.642 --> 22:08.492
I would have guessed probably on the order of 40. So 
maybe two-thirds. Yeah. And how many had gone to

22:13.177 --> 22:17.162
A&M for their pre-vet?

22:20.826 --> 22:22.168
Probably about two-thirds. Any out-of-staters 
then? Yeah, we had the Louisiana crews. Oh, that

22:26.685 --> 22:28.791
was already? Uh-huh. How did they fare? Well,

22:30.295 --> 22:40.682
my class was a little different, a little unusual 
in that we had a large number of students, people

22:41.675 --> 22:53.427
who started out with us who went to medical school, 
dropped out and went to medical school, and a

22:41.675 --> 22:53.427
couple went to dental school. I think of 64, I think 
there were 13 that did that. And so our class was

23:01.896 --> 23:09.184
referred to for a few years as being that that 
particular class where so many of them and what

23:09.890 --> 23:37.990
were they and this included about uh see we we i 
think we had nine from louisiana and i think three

23:09.890 --> 23:37.990
of them did that went into medical school were 
there were there any activities early in that

23:09.890 --> 23:37.990
first year to bring you all together any social or 
any other kind of well we had the What at that time

23:39.809 --> 23:51.402
was a glorified, it was a barbecue and a beer bust 
that the class before us put on for us. And that's

23:51.582 --> 23:54.225
the way it was done for many, many years. And then 
probably you may remember the

23:55.166 --> 24:07.200
barbecue that this had really expanded by the 
seventies in but we still had one in the first week

24:11.433 --> 24:14.537
or two of classes. And the second year class always 
was responsible for it. In your first year, where

24:22.128 --> 24:24.151
was it held? At the VFW grounds on 21, Highway 21. 
And

24:31.842 --> 24:39.573
faculty and all students came, not just your 
class? That's right. No, no, this was just our

24:40.711 --> 24:46.958
class and the sophomore class, the two classes. 
And

24:47.979 --> 24:55.447
there was a feeling of warmth? Yeah, we had, there

24:56.088 --> 25:07.360
was good rapport established during that.

25:07.508 --> 25:15.421
The faculty all, particularly the faculty who 
were teaching those classes, it was, you just saw

25:07.508 --> 25:15.421
them there. They didn't, it wasn't something that 
maybe one or two faculty would show up. But, you

25:21.891 --> 25:35.372
know, with Al Price's value system being around a 
bunch of beard up students would not have been his

25:21.891 --> 25:35.372
idea of a pleasant evening. But he was there, and he 
would really join in telling stories and enjoying

25:35.892 --> 25:48.083
the stories and things like that. And

25:48.123 --> 26:03.517
so for you and your buddies going through that fall 
semester, what was, or that whole first year you

25:48.123 --> 26:03.517
lived on campus, what was your, what was a typical 
routine? You got up, went to chow. went over to the

26:06.217 --> 26:12.786
vet school, and we had a lot of labs. The labs, you 
know, the gross anatomy class, for example, just

26:13.607 --> 26:27.666
use that as an example, we had three four-hour labs 
a week.

26:28.847 --> 26:32.593
So for each four hours, we got one hour of credit. 
See, that was a four-hour course. We got We had one

26:35.039 --> 26:39.185
hour of lecture and three, four hour labs. So that 
was a four hour course. 13 hours of contact time

26:42.370 --> 26:46.016
with that. That was cut back then a little later on 
in the scheme of things. I'm not talking about

26:52.266 --> 26:56.452
while I was a student, but while I was on the 
faculty. When we went through the trimester, see,

26:57.193 --> 27:02.802
everything, all the four hour labs were reduced to 
a three hour lab. And then in the 70s, well, most of

27:03.811 --> 27:10.783
the three-hour labs were reduced to a two-hour 
lab.

27:13.588 --> 27:16.152
You went over to the vet school. You were there all 
morning. Did you all go back to Duncan for supper? I

27:19.939 --> 27:20.680
mean, for lunch? For lunch, uh-huh. And we'd get 
there. Usually, we were 12, 10, 12, 15 getting

27:23.124 --> 27:27.272
there. We had to eat. And then be right back. For a 
one o'clock. Uh-huh. Then you're there all

27:32.337 --> 27:33.638
afternoon. Then back to Chow where there are some 
labs at night. But did you go back to the vet school

27:39.104 --> 27:42.508
at night or did you study in your room? Both. As we 
began to prepare for exams, well, we'd often go

27:45.091 --> 27:49.436
back.

27:52.900 --> 27:57.645
But, see, we were a large... number of us were 
living in dorm two, and so we were really

27:57.895 --> 28:17.720
concentrated, and the class ahead of us were 
living in that particular dorm, so we had a

27:57.895 --> 28:17.720
concentration of vet students. Was there good 
bull going on elsewhere in the dorm?

28:23.225 --> 28:26.028
There'd be some nights, yeah, there'd be. But the 
vet students, y'all weren't involved in that? Not

28:29.552 --> 28:30.333
too much. OK, so wasn't any drown outs and all that. 
Then Saturday in class or lab till noon. Yeah. And

28:41.805 --> 28:48.493
by and large, then you took Saturday afternoon and 
Sunday off.

28:49.013 --> 28:50.395
That was pretty much the routine. Now, we didn't 
have, you know, we'd have an hour free time in the

28:53.718 --> 28:59.324
morning maybe or maybe two hours sometimes. What 
would you do with that? Well when we were I remember

29:00.705 --> 29:19.945
when we were sophomores or our second year in vet 
school we were living in I lived in law hall with a

29:00.705 --> 29:19.945
group and we would bust it back if we sometimes when 
we had an hour but especially if we had a two hour and

29:00.705 --> 29:19.945
I think there was a maybe Tuesdays and Thursdays, 
we may have had a two-hour break in the middle of the

29:21.393 --> 29:27.240
morning. And we'd go back to the room and play shoot 
the moon. That just got to be a big thing with the

29:32.788 --> 29:40.017
group, and we were very competitive with it. So 
rather than studying like theoretically you

29:40.097 --> 29:51.231
would, and like we were more inclined to do as 
freshmen, I mean, our first year, we... Right, and

29:54.542 --> 29:59.910
you vet students attended Silver Taps, and you 
went to Bonfire. The ones that lived on campus,

29:59.970 --> 30:02.013
uh-huh. But when you were a vet student, you all 
didn't work on... Didn't work on Bonfire, uh-uh.

30:09.624 --> 30:14.211
Academically, the first year, how did it go?

30:17.576 --> 30:19.058
It went well. And were grades then posted publicly 
in vet school? Oh, yeah. I did well in vet school. I

30:28.778 --> 30:29.839
thought you had. There were five of us that kind of 
built a little, well, there was a gap anyway

30:29.859 --> 30:40.093
between. Did the five of y'all get a nickname?

30:44.980 --> 30:45.320
Well. That's tellable? Trying to think of the 
group.

30:56.540 --> 31:02.627
We had, the top student in our class was a guy by the 
name of Wallace Klebb. Wally was the captain of the

31:03.428 --> 31:06.853
track team his senior year. And he's been, and he 
was president of the Letterman's, he's been

31:06.913 --> 31:14.662
president of the Letterman's. CLEB or KLEB? KLEB. 
Wallace Klebb. He practiced for many, many years

31:19.045 --> 31:24.499
in Houston, small animal practice, in his 
century.
