WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:09.679
Life is pretty much dominated by the dean and the director of the Ag Experiment Station.

00:10.060 --> 00:12.265
Which one mattered most?

00:12.285 --> 00:15.171
Well, the director of the Ag Experiment Station had the money.

00:16.433 --> 00:26.069
And you need to get along both of them, but the Experiment Station Director had the most part, the biggest part of your budget.

00:26.289 --> 00:27.251
All right, now that was R.D.

00:27.291 --> 00:28.333
Lewis when you started?

00:28.353 --> 00:29.274
That's when I started.

00:29.334 --> 00:29.955
Then who?

00:30.176 --> 00:31.738
Jarvis.

00:31.758 --> 00:32.560
Did he follow?

00:32.580 --> 00:35.344
Well, Jarvis was an associate under Harry for a while.

00:36.346 --> 00:37.908
Did Jarvis follow R.D.

00:38.109 --> 00:40.212
exactly?

00:40.232 --> 00:41.935
Was there no in-between?

00:42.877 --> 00:43.919
Well, R.D.

00:43.959 --> 00:47.264
Lewis was dean and director and Harry was associate director.

00:47.304 --> 00:50.329
And so Harry, in a sense, ran the experiment station.

00:51.471 --> 00:59.584
And then when Harry became dean and director, he made Jarvis associate director and then eventually made Jarvis director.

01:00.325 --> 01:05.273
And then when Jarvis became director, they had a little split.

01:05.253 --> 01:10.077
All right, were there any notable times?

01:10.097 --> 01:13.941
And the other person you had to deal with more than anybody else is provost.

01:15.062 --> 01:17.624
See, department heads, you had to deal a lot with provost.

01:17.644 --> 01:21.307
In your experience, who did you go see first?

01:21.368 --> 01:22.368
Oh, the dean and director.

01:22.769 --> 01:23.870
The dean and director.

01:23.890 --> 01:25.711
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25.731 --> 01:35.260
And did you ever have any situations you can share where there was a difference of the two people?

01:36.168 --> 01:38.835
When something got hung up?

01:39.196 --> 01:40.038
Yeah.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.524
There were some differences.

01:42.604 --> 01:43.667
It sometimes happened?

01:43.908 --> 01:45.431
Yeah.

01:48.539 --> 01:50.785
Especially when you had a

01:54.848 --> 02:05.781
independent directors like John Hutchison and Jarvis, who are strong-minded and independent, and you'd have some problems maneuvering between John, Jarvis, and Harry.

02:06.702 --> 02:08.104
Because you had to work with all three.

02:08.124 --> 02:09.846
All of them, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:09.866 --> 02:11.728
I had a three-way reporting relationship.

02:11.808 --> 02:17.295
And the biggest share of the money came from the experiment station.

02:17.435 --> 02:17.956
Okay.

02:19.197 --> 02:20.839
In a personnel decision,

02:22.102 --> 02:29.278
to employ or to terminate, which of those three opinions counted most?

02:29.298 --> 02:34.711
Well, his faculty member, Harry, they deferred.

02:35.232 --> 02:37.056
If it's an extension person, John,

02:38.369 --> 02:40.992
Hutchison passed on every extension employee.

02:41.272 --> 02:43.515
I mean, he made the final decision.

02:43.535 --> 02:46.598
You made a recommendation, but he made the decision.

02:46.618 --> 02:48.380
Describe his management style.

02:48.761 --> 02:50.843
Well, he was an elephant dictator, too.

02:52.485 --> 02:52.645
Okay.

02:52.985 --> 02:54.527
And could be autocratic.

02:55.368 --> 02:56.769
But he's a very reasonable man.

02:56.830 --> 03:01.795
I had a great relationship with John Hutchison.

03:02.382 --> 03:17.163
A lot of department heads here complained in the College of Agriculture that they didn't have control of the extension program, and that there were only two department heads that had control of the extension programs, and that was O.D.

03:17.183 --> 03:17.844
Butler and me.

03:19.026 --> 03:25.976
And so I never had any problem, but I always considered I was an extension, you know.

03:26.277 --> 03:32.085
I figured that I was an extension employee, and I acted like one.

03:33.500 --> 03:38.404
I also put extension on par with everything else.

03:38.524 --> 03:41.167
We didn't have any, I tried not to have any second class citizens.

03:41.207 --> 03:49.734
A lot of departments, extension would be second class, but I tried to always keep them up first class and always try to hire really good people.

03:49.894 --> 03:53.938
So I never had any, I ran my extension program.

03:54.979 --> 04:00.203
I never had John Hutchison never reversed the recommendation I ever made.

04:00.664 --> 04:02.325
What about Harry's management style?

04:04.297 --> 04:12.146
Well, I'd say Harry's management style is even more in tune with Jack Williams.

04:12.166 --> 04:17.332
Harry's very academic, appreciates good faculty.

04:17.352 --> 04:18.253
He's intellectual.

04:19.334 --> 04:26.823
And he's not autocratic.

04:27.023 --> 04:28.405
He's not autocratic.

04:28.805 --> 04:33.831
Now, Jarvis becomes Experiment Station Director in the early 70s?

04:36.950 --> 04:38.692
I can't remember the time frame.

04:38.792 --> 04:42.296
Because he becomes president in 77, early seven.

04:42.317 --> 04:43.017
Yeah.

04:43.037 --> 04:46.542
So he became Experimental Station Director probably in the mid-70s.

04:46.802 --> 04:47.142
Okay.

04:48.284 --> 04:49.485
In 75 or so.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.048
Describe his style.

04:53.690 --> 05:03.362
Well, Jarvis could be more autocratic certainly than Harry.

05:06.110 --> 05:11.421
Jarvis was more territorial in some ways, I think.

05:11.441 --> 05:17.593
But I had a good relationship with Jarvis, and I never had any problem.

05:17.653 --> 05:25.789
And I've heard Jarvis described, and I think that's right, that he's a heck of a good boss, but he's sometimes not a very good employee.

05:27.153 --> 05:46.882
When you were department head, was it advantageous to you at that level that the CEO, chief executive officer of the Texas A&M University was also the chief executive officer of the system?

05:46.902 --> 05:48.565
It didn't make any difference to me.

05:50.908 --> 05:55.455
I was asked that question after I became chancellor.

05:58.220 --> 06:03.088
And in fact, I was asked at one point, why don't you just be chancellor and president?

06:04.671 --> 06:11.822
And I said, you got two people in the cemetery now that did that.

06:12.624 --> 06:17.612
And I don't think you ought to combine those offices.

06:19.043 --> 06:22.829
because chancellor's got one function.

06:22.869 --> 06:25.573
If you do that job well, you can't be president of A&M.

06:25.633 --> 06:28.337
If you do the job president of A&M, you can't do the chancellor.

06:29.218 --> 06:35.587
And the other part is I don't want to be president of Texas A&M.

06:35.607 --> 06:39.653
There's no way I'd ever be president of Texas A&M.

06:39.673 --> 06:42.958
And I was asked why, and I said, well, I'll tell you why.

06:44.474 --> 06:47.518
The president of Texas A&M has no life of his own.

06:49.240 --> 07:04.641
He's on constant call to the faculty, to the students and the former students, and I don't want to, I don't, I'm too much of a private individual to do that.

07:04.661 --> 07:13.873
I don't want to spend my days meeting with student groups, faculty groups, and former student groups seven days a week.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.403
I don't even want to do it two or three days a week.

07:16.463 --> 07:24.775
So because of those kinds of pressures, I wouldn't ever want to be a university president.

07:24.795 --> 07:26.457
And my wife would divorce me.

07:28.039 --> 07:32.065
And the chancellor doesn't have to do that.

07:32.213 --> 07:37.207
Chancellor works with the board and doesn't have to do a little bit of it, but not much.

07:37.809 --> 07:40.496
And you can dictate pretty much what you want to do and not.

07:41.579 --> 07:47.877
But the president of a university like A&M is the ceremonial

07:47.857 --> 07:50.540
Ceremonial stuff is so demanding.

07:51.161 --> 07:54.204
You don't have time to do anything else.

07:54.224 --> 07:59.451
But put those two jobs together is the impossible.

07:59.951 --> 08:06.459
As a department head, did you have any ceremonial responsibilities?

08:06.479 --> 08:09.502
Were there any places you had to show up for something?

08:09.562 --> 08:11.585
Well, you had to show up at the dean's meetings.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.466
Yeah, yeah.

08:12.486 --> 08:14.028
Yeah.

08:14.048 --> 08:16.851
And not much, not much.

08:18.569 --> 08:32.990
I thought the department head, fiscally, the fiscal demands of being department head and intermology department is, and it's probably true of the other ag departments, is really high.

08:33.070 --> 08:35.754
It's the hardest job that I ever did.

08:35.774 --> 08:38.518
It's much harder than being vice president or even chancellor.

08:39.207 --> 08:48.398
Because you have to spend your days listening to faculty and students and their complaints and whatever.

08:48.438 --> 08:52.903
And in our case, you've got 14 centers across the state you've got to deal with.

08:53.544 --> 08:59.331
So it's a tremendous amount of travel and dealing with commodity groups.

08:59.351 --> 09:01.974
And so you can't set your own schedule.

09:02.054 --> 09:05.839
As chancellor, I found I could set my schedule if I told Vicki.

09:06.663 --> 09:10.548
I don't see anybody today unless it's a Regent.

09:11.028 --> 09:21.261
You don't have to see it so you can control your life so that you can get, you know, what I was doing as department head, I sat up here all day listening to the faculty and my door was open.

09:21.301 --> 09:23.004
I didn't want to keep a closed door.

09:23.024 --> 09:24.666
Then I'd come back at night and do the work.

09:24.706 --> 09:26.528
I'd get up here real early in the morning.

09:27.065 --> 09:32.446
During those years, you were department head within the College of Agriculture.

09:32.467 --> 09:37.125
Which of the other department heads were the most influential with the dean and the director?

09:39.468 --> 09:40.309
I think O.D.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.490
and I were.

09:41.510 --> 09:42.371
Who?

09:42.512 --> 09:42.772
O.D.

09:42.792 --> 09:43.092
Butler.

09:43.673 --> 09:43.773
Yeah.

09:43.793 --> 09:44.734
And animal science.

09:44.794 --> 09:45.816
Describe O.D.'

09:45.796 --> 09:47.978
's manner and style.

09:47.998 --> 09:49.941
Well, O.D.

09:50.001 --> 10:00.053
was of the same school style as General Rudder, but he was a team player.

10:01.014 --> 10:05.980
Once a decision was made, he would execute it.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.783
He was extremely well-liked.

10:09.100 --> 10:13.886
by people out in the state in the animal business.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.850
I think he was well liked by his faculty.

10:17.511 --> 10:22.057
If not, he was respected by those who maybe didn't like him, they respected him because he was fair.

10:23.299 --> 10:25.642
And he was a guy who produced results.

10:27.224 --> 10:31.249
And he was open to change.

10:32.211 --> 10:33.252
He was open to change.

10:35.223 --> 10:45.975
And so I'd say in the process of the evolution of A&M, O.D.

10:46.015 --> 10:55.625
and I were, I don't know whether he was the first department head or member of the faculty to become president of the National Professional Society or I was.

10:56.466 --> 11:04.335
But we both were professional, were, I was elected president of the Entomological Society of America in 19,

11:04.771 --> 11:16.547
I was the first person from the southwestern branch and the first person from Texas A&M, and he was elected president of the Animal Science Society about that time.

11:17.588 --> 11:31.387
Were there any other department heads that you think that the dean or the director would have been very quick to hear them after you and OD?

11:32.368 --> 11:33.630
Is there anybody else?

11:33.610 --> 11:35.132
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:35.152 --> 11:39.799
Bob Merrifield was a good department head and then Morris Budworth and Joe Schuster.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.122
Schuster was in what department?

11:42.142 --> 11:42.963
Rains of Sciences.

11:43.344 --> 11:48.651
And John Hopkins over in Ag E. Co.

11:48.671 --> 11:51.315
We had a lot of good department heads and they, they,

11:51.295 --> 11:56.784
I'm not going to ask the negative on this one either.

11:56.804 --> 12:07.803
Which ag departments during the 60s and 70s, other than entomology, do you think made the greatest progress in reputation, quality, etc.?

12:10.448 --> 12:12.932
Which others were moving forward rapidly?

12:13.621 --> 12:16.185
Animal science I think did well.

12:20.330 --> 12:21.512
Soil and crop sciences.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.062
I think ag eco has come on pretty good too.

12:32.928 --> 12:38.295
Biochemistry has had its ups and downs.

12:39.423 --> 12:45.775
Animal science and entomology and soil crop sciences be considered strong departments.

12:45.795 --> 12:48.520
What have we not covered that's on your list there?

12:51.206 --> 12:57.718
Well, as a faculty member,

13:06.777 --> 13:10.262
I was, I received the Alexander Von Humboldt Award.

13:12.084 --> 13:13.686
Let me talk a little bit about that.

13:15.389 --> 13:29.128
In about 1980 for outstanding contributions to agriculture, which is first national, really national, international type award.

13:30.289 --> 13:35.957
And I was first person at A&M to receive that and probably the only one to this day.

13:37.287 --> 13:50.102
And then in 1994 I received the Wolf Prize in agriculture from Israel, first Texan to receive a Wolf Prize.

13:51.704 --> 13:59.474
There are no Nobel Prizes in agriculture, so a Wolf Prize is one of the top international prizes.

13:59.534 --> 14:03.919
And then in 1997 I got the World Food Prize.

14:06.532 --> 14:09.821
I'm the only person at A&M that received those prizes.

14:09.861 --> 14:13.511
In fact, I'm the only person right now that's ever received all three of them.

14:14.754 --> 14:17.622
And I take quite a bit of pride in that.

14:18.063 --> 14:22.836
Justifiably.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.194
and my election to the National Academy.

14:27.755 --> 14:36.666
And, of course, I think it, one, reflects the kind of faculty we have in A&M now.

14:38.208 --> 14:50.782
And I think it also says that if Prairie can be recognized in that way, it means anybody on the faculty has that possibility.

14:50.883 --> 14:53.025
We have elected some more people in the academy.

14:53.900 --> 14:57.163
And we do have some people nominated for the Wolf Prize.

14:58.104 --> 15:12.159
So I'd say one of the things we haven't done well here is getting faculty members recognized at national and international level.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.680
The university doesn't do that well.

15:14.701 --> 15:17.144
I'm going to give you a couple of examples right quick.

15:17.864 --> 15:18.145
O.D.

15:18.185 --> 15:22.489
Butler taught me.

15:22.857 --> 15:28.985
was wondering why in the world all the people in animal science were getting these former student awards and we weren't getting any.

15:30.828 --> 15:34.713
And because I said, hell, my people are better than yours.

15:34.733 --> 15:37.257
But I found out he was nominating them and we weren't.

15:37.978 --> 15:46.930
I said, you know, you got to get people nominated and you got to develop a package and somebody has to do that because these awards don't just fall out of heaven on you.

15:46.950 --> 15:47.210
That's right.

15:47.230 --> 15:48.392
And the university is not

15:49.250 --> 15:51.553
has not and is not doing a good job.

15:52.154 --> 15:57.202
And that's where national, international prestige comes from.

15:57.222 --> 15:57.602
Comes from.

15:57.622 --> 16:00.967
I'm going to give you three examples of what I'm talking about.

16:03.751 --> 16:15.088
Sir Derek Barton was a Nobel Prize winner, died here of a heart attack working in chemistry up to the day he died.

16:15.108 --> 16:18.092
He got a little notice in the obituary column

16:18.916 --> 16:23.781
of Brian Eagle about this long.

16:23.801 --> 16:40.459
Peter O'Donnell in Dallas, who has the O'Donnell Foundation, who's endowed some chairs here anonymously and he's done a lot of work in higher education, sent me a copy of that obituary notice.

16:42.401 --> 16:48.788
Then he put in the same letter, the obituary notice on the New York Times for Sir Derek Martin.

16:51.586 --> 17:08.313
This year, Norman Borlaug received the Vandiver Bush Award for the National Science Foundation.

17:08.333 --> 17:14.303
Next to the National Medal of Science or the Nobel Prize, the Vandiver Bush Award is one of the

17:16.713 --> 17:25.083
You read the list of people who have received that award and it's like reading the who's who of science and the world of the U.S.

17:25.103 --> 17:28.948
which is of the world because Nobel Prize winner after Nobel Prize winner.

17:31.651 --> 17:35.575
Vocal paper didn't have one, there's not been one line about it.

17:37.117 --> 17:39.480
I don't know whether the president of the university

17:40.540 --> 17:41.982
received a notice of that.

17:42.202 --> 17:58.880
Surely must have received an invitation to go to that presentation because it was made in the State Department of the, and probably was attended by the Vice President.

17:58.900 --> 18:04.006
Again, the New York Times carried quite a nice article about that.

18:04.026 --> 18:06.088
Now, we're not even honoring our own people.

18:06.349 --> 18:07.910
That's right.

18:07.931 --> 18:10.193
And you can't go out and recruit some people.

18:11.236 --> 18:12.698
for that reason.

18:12.718 --> 18:16.762
And I had one, one experience I want to relate.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.929
It tells you why this is important.

18:22.949 --> 18:26.633
I always operated on the view that we could recruit anybody.

18:27.894 --> 18:38.746
So I'd say, folks, as I've said earlier in this conversation, let's let the person we're trying to recruit make that judgment about whether they want to come here or not.

18:40.809 --> 18:41.209
Well,

18:44.986 --> 18:54.622
We were recruiting when I was deputy chancellor for agriculture a fellow, the Phil Wolf Welch chair, which is a nice chair.

18:56.084 --> 19:06.261
And we were spending quite a bit of time and money to build up Department of Biochemistry and we had a very dynamic head named Eugene Sander.

19:06.541 --> 19:08.344
You remember Eugene Sander?

19:09.758 --> 19:13.443
Well, Gene knew talent and he knew how to identify it.

19:13.483 --> 19:26.701
So he identified a fellow, a young man at Harvard who was not a tenured professor and came and said, we ought to get somebody working on photosynthesis.

19:28.203 --> 19:30.426
And I said, Gene, I think that's great.

19:30.446 --> 19:33.990
Photosynthesis drives all plant growth and development.

19:35.232 --> 19:39.698
And that I'd say do that if you could find really a,

19:39.914 --> 19:44.679
top person, if you can't find a top person, don't get any."

19:44.699 --> 19:46.321
And he said, I've got one identified.

19:46.962 --> 19:52.127
He said, Harvard, and he is good, and he's not tenured.

19:52.147 --> 19:55.130
He's just starting, but he's done enough post-doc.

19:56.332 --> 20:01.377
And he said, I'll need your help to recruit this person.

20:01.397 --> 20:04.280
I said, you got it.

20:04.300 --> 20:07.404
Let's go get him.

20:07.424 --> 20:08.605
Well, we started on him.

20:10.576 --> 20:22.193
And we had him down here, offered him everything that you could imagine and much more than I knew because Carol Williams was still at Harvard.

20:22.233 --> 20:23.534
I checked him out with Carol.

20:25.217 --> 20:36.533
And so he came down and we couldn't get an answer out of him.

20:39.061 --> 20:42.047
So I said, Gene, let's go.

20:42.548 --> 20:45.735
I'm going to go to Harvard and talk to him.

20:45.755 --> 20:52.649
I'd become acquainted with him, and I said, I'll just go up there and nail this deal.

20:52.669 --> 20:56.817
So I went up there.

20:57.117 --> 21:03.964
He had gotten from Carroll enough background to know what his situation was in Harvard.

21:03.984 --> 21:12.152
But Carroll had already told me, he said, this guy is a cinch to be elected to the academy and probably win a Nobel Prize before he finishes.

21:14.154 --> 21:17.617
So his name is Fred Ausubel.

21:18.498 --> 21:23.243
And I said, Fred, I didn't come up here to take no now.

21:25.670 --> 21:33.044
I know that our offer for salary, for facilities, everything is much better than what you got here.

21:34.066 --> 21:38.374
And hell, you don't even know where you're going to get tenure, you know?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.223
And he said, well, Perry,

21:45.802 --> 21:57.700
everything you say is true, that y'all have offered me a lot more than I'm worth and certainly more than Harvard's offered me.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.082
He says, I think I'll get tenure.

21:59.162 --> 22:00.824
I'm not worried about that.

22:02.106 --> 22:04.510
But he says, I'm not coming to Texas A&M.

22:06.773 --> 22:07.995
And I said, Fred?

22:09.595 --> 22:13.242
tell me why you're not coming to Texas A&M.

22:13.763 --> 22:16.729
Is it location or what?"

22:16.749 --> 22:18.993
No, it's got nothing to do with that.

22:20.636 --> 22:27.469
He said, if I came to Texas A&M and started my career there and stayed there,

22:30.183 --> 22:43.860
I'm kissing goodbye to my chances of being elected to the National Academy of Sciences or any other recognition above that because you guys don't have people.

22:43.901 --> 22:51.330
You can't get elected down there and you can't get the kind of recognition, I believe, that I won't.

22:52.087 --> 22:56.291
And the people you most want to have as colleagues are folks that have those ambitions.

22:56.391 --> 22:58.293
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:58.313 --> 23:02.357
So I said, okay, I can buy that.

23:02.377 --> 23:03.458
That's a valid reason.

23:04.499 --> 23:08.602
And we won't worry you anymore.

23:08.983 --> 23:11.365
If you change your mind, give us a call.

23:11.385 --> 23:13.087
But that's a valid reason.

23:13.187 --> 23:14.048
I understand that.

23:15.369 --> 23:18.752
And I came back and I told Gene, I said, well,

23:18.833 --> 23:27.467
I had said that I believe we could compete for anybody, but there are some people we can't compete with.

23:27.487 --> 23:28.692
What else have we left out?

23:30.072 --> 23:34.939
Well, we haven't talked about being chancellor.

23:35.079 --> 23:36.881
No, no, that we'll do another day.

23:36.901 --> 23:38.884
And we haven't talked about the Bush Library.

23:39.105 --> 23:41.748
No, we'll do that another day, and we'll do the deputy.

23:41.768 --> 23:42.870
And the deputy chancellor.

23:42.890 --> 23:44.011
We'll do that another day.

23:44.292 --> 23:44.953
Yeah, okay.

23:44.973 --> 23:58.932
All right, so let's conclude today about faculty with, as you were getting ready to move up in the administrative ladder, of what were you most proud about your years in the Department of Entomology?

24:07.366 --> 24:17.202
Well, I was proud of my personal accomplishments and research and the recognition that I got.

24:18.083 --> 24:21.589
The thing I'm most proud of is being elected National Academy of Sciences.

24:21.649 --> 24:22.971
Sure, sure.

24:22.991 --> 24:30.403
And, but in terms of the department, I was, I'm proud of the department.

24:31.092 --> 24:53.378
and the people I brought here and of the directions we've, the changes we've been able to make so that the entomology department now is not only one of the largest entomology departments in the U.S., but it's also rated, ranked as one of the best.

24:53.398 --> 24:59.766
And we've got faculty members who are internationally known

25:01.062 --> 25:03.425
and highly respected in their fields.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.388
And we've got more than one.

25:05.408 --> 25:06.629
We've got a number of them.

25:08.151 --> 25:21.348
So I've taken a great deal of pride in seeing the people that I was instrumental in recruiting, that they have done in the department what I'd hoped they'd do.

25:22.029 --> 25:23.050
They brought us breath.

25:23.110 --> 25:24.973
They brought us recognition.

25:24.993 --> 25:28.217
They put their students out in other faculty positions.

25:28.990 --> 25:38.660
are now leading people in the field so that you don't have to apologize.

25:41.383 --> 25:51.353
And that's one thing that bothered me about A&M in the early days is you sometimes sort of had to apologize for being at Texas A&M.

25:53.055 --> 25:54.717
But I don't think we have to do that anymore.

25:55.398 --> 25:56.719
Let's quit with that.
