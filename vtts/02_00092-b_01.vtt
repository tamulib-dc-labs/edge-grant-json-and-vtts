WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:07.110
So we were guarding it, and my roommate and I were out.

00:08.772 --> 00:11.676
Well, in one corner, they'd bring coffee and sandwiches by.

00:11.816 --> 00:17.082
The food service would make coffee and sandwiches, and they had a pickup truck.

00:17.102 --> 00:20.586
They brought the food by at night, and so we were out there all night.

00:21.307 --> 00:23.890
Now, I don't know why they don't guard it now, I don't think, do they?

00:23.910 --> 00:27.475
I don't know whether they do or not, but we were on all corners of the campus.

00:27.515 --> 00:30.618
We were out here.

00:30.638 --> 00:31.219
But anyway.

00:31.705 --> 00:33.609
And in fact, was it fun?

00:34.351 --> 00:36.917
Yes, uh-huh, yeah.

00:36.937 --> 00:43.010
I think it was all fun then, and the reason I say that is because you couldn't lock your room.

00:44.694 --> 00:50.507
So as a result, if they were bad to us, then we'd drown them out that night.

00:50.673 --> 00:53.177
So you've got to give and a take with everybody.

00:53.217 --> 01:07.121
You know, it wasn't a fact that today they, the students feel it's personal when a sophomore, junior yells at them or stands them on the wall, whatever they call it.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.908
And in those days, we didn't take it personal.

01:12.210 --> 01:13.913
You know, we just said, fine, go ahead.

01:14.939 --> 01:19.386
just watch out for tonight or tomorrow night or the next night, you know, and sure enough, he'd come.

01:20.848 --> 01:28.580
Can you share any of the best Good Bull events you recall, whether you were involved in them or not, they were during your time?

01:29.481 --> 01:31.765
What were some of the most distinctive, unusual?

01:32.105 --> 01:39.276
Well, the one that comes to mind, they had just, two juniors had borrowed a board.

01:40.808 --> 01:46.776
from A Infantry from downstairs, which was their pride and joy board.

01:48.419 --> 02:03.340
And that day at noon, I think it was at noon, or that evening anyway, they proceeded to have a

02:06.357 --> 02:10.522
board contest with us sophomores, with my classmates.

02:12.605 --> 02:14.928
And so they put the board up and went to the movie.

02:16.450 --> 02:23.539
And so my roommate and I, who were very nice all-around cadets, went in and got the board.

02:23.559 --> 02:32.010
They'd hit it, they'd pulled out their cabinet, their medicine cabinet, and hung it down in the wall behind their medicine cabinet.

02:34.032 --> 02:39.741
So we went in and got it, and I took it out and put it in a bush at the corner of the dorm.

02:40.222 --> 02:42.786
How did John Noble look about behind the cabinet?

02:43.007 --> 02:46.172
Well, we just searched two or three places and finally found it.

02:47.254 --> 02:58.612
And so I took it out and put it in a bush, stuffed it down in a bush in front of the dorm, on one corner of the dorm.

02:58.632 --> 03:00.495
So when they came back,

03:01.252 --> 03:08.030
The next day, A Infantry wanted their board back and our friends couldn't find it.

03:10.055 --> 03:11.559
And they really got it.

03:11.579 --> 03:16.392
I mean, they, because they had some seniors in that outfit that were bloody.

03:17.232 --> 03:19.435
Very bloody people.

03:19.455 --> 03:29.229
And so that next night, I put on my dungarees and put it in my pants leg and took it over to Hart Hall where I had a friend that was going home that weekend.

03:30.551 --> 03:31.773
I'd gone to high school with him.

03:32.154 --> 03:33.255
He was a year behind me.

03:34.056 --> 03:35.899
So he took it home and gave it to my mother.

03:37.261 --> 03:44.151
And I kept that board until just about three years ago and I gave it to the guy that we stole it from.

03:46.443 --> 03:47.765
And he gave it to his son.

03:47.785 --> 03:54.476
I don't have any heirs to give it to, and he had a son, so he could pass it on to his son.

03:54.857 --> 03:57.481
See, that's a precious story.

03:57.581 --> 03:58.523
That's a precious story.

03:58.543 --> 04:00.626
But I guess I had that thing 45 years.

04:00.686 --> 04:05.454
My mother kept it, and I kept it, and didn't really know what to do with it.

04:05.474 --> 04:06.516
I just never did throw it away.

04:07.457 --> 04:09.160
So I finally gave it to him.

04:10.034 --> 04:12.217
so he could give it to his son to pass on.

04:13.298 --> 04:16.722
What about some one-of-a-kind drown outs?

04:18.745 --> 04:21.548
Oh, well, my roommate and I, we drowned the same two guys out.

04:22.169 --> 04:24.832
They were pretty bad guys.

04:24.852 --> 04:27.676
And we didn't get away with that one, though.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.378
I think they caught us.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.503
What was your planned routine on these?

04:35.585 --> 04:36.987
Well, the plan is just

04:37.507 --> 04:39.332
to sneak in and throw the water.

04:39.713 --> 04:40.996
There's one guy at the door.

04:42.640 --> 04:48.495
I can't tell this story really, but there's one guy at the door and one guy throws the water.

04:49.910 --> 05:06.229
you put it in your trash can, you pull the door to, and the doors open in, and there's a stick that has a little cutout on it that fits the door knob, and you put the stick on it, then you have time to run and hopefully clean your trash can out.

05:06.890 --> 05:14.519
Because if they find water in it or drops of water in it, then you're dead, dead meat to them.

05:14.539 --> 05:17.402
So we did that once or twice to those guys, you know.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.181
So it was good.

05:21.721 --> 05:26.248
That's what I mean by having fun, you know.

05:26.388 --> 05:27.209
Did you get caught?

05:27.650 --> 05:28.211
Oh, yeah.

05:28.231 --> 05:29.413
And then what was the punishment?

05:29.793 --> 05:33.178
Well, they just gave us the board again.

05:33.238 --> 05:36.764
They didn't give us many demerits, you know, put us on a bull ring.

05:36.784 --> 05:40.048
That wasn't their deal in my outfit.

05:40.088 --> 05:43.554
They just, they loved to beat our rear ends more than.

05:44.615 --> 05:49.262
All right, that fall, did you go on court trips that first year?

05:51.065 --> 05:52.527
I think I went to Fort Worth.

05:52.587 --> 05:54.629
I think I went to the Fort Worth court trip.

05:54.709 --> 05:55.690
I went to one, I know.

05:56.031 --> 05:56.812
How did you get up there?

05:57.613 --> 05:58.534
I have no idea.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.297
I just have no idea whether.

06:01.617 --> 06:02.578
Do you remember where you stayed?

06:02.939 --> 06:05.222
No.

06:05.242 --> 06:08.065
My recollection of all those days are just.

06:08.085 --> 06:15.013
And how were Aggies, when they marched down the main street of a town on a court trip, how were they treated?

06:15.466 --> 06:17.150
Well, they were treated pretty good, you know.

06:17.370 --> 06:18.813
I've never heard anything but positive.

06:18.954 --> 06:20.196
No, they were all treated.

06:20.337 --> 06:22.020
People really liked to see us, you know.

06:22.621 --> 06:23.624
Did you ever hitchhike?

06:24.425 --> 06:28.855
Yeah.

06:28.875 --> 06:32.142
Living in Houston, of course, we went out here to the East Gate.

06:33.100 --> 06:37.826
which is where the line started, in Houston anyway, and would hitchhike home.

06:37.846 --> 06:41.250
And the line at home from Houston started out on Shepherd and Washington.

06:42.472 --> 06:44.214
So I'd have somebody take us out there.

06:44.234 --> 06:48.879
We were about four blocks from the Southern Pacific train station.

06:51.082 --> 06:54.366
And the last train left about 11 o'clock.

06:54.386 --> 06:55.868
The Owl, they called it.

06:57.552 --> 07:04.279
And so if we hadn't caught a ride by 10.30, we'd get out there before dark, sometimes about 7.

07:05.080 --> 07:11.186
But if we hadn't caught a ride by 10.30, we'd start running to the train station and get on the Al.

07:11.606 --> 07:15.070
And the Al would leave there at 11 and get in here at 4.30.

07:16.971 --> 07:24.859
Because it was the Houston Post run and the milk run, so it stopped at every telephone pole, you know, to drop off the milk and the paper.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.542
But we'd get back in time to...

07:28.906 --> 07:30.608
go to class or get to the dorm.

07:31.630 --> 07:34.153
Didn't have to do that too often.

07:34.874 --> 07:38.378
Did you or any of your buddies ever have a bad experience hitchhiking?

07:41.382 --> 07:49.513
No, the only one I heard about, I wasn't with them, but they were telling me that they caught a ride out of Houston

07:50.962 --> 07:55.188
And at the bridge on this side of Navasota is a deep gully.

07:56.089 --> 07:56.910
You remember that?

07:58.112 --> 08:02.538
The guy was drunk and ran right off down in that gully.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.103
So they all got out, went back up on the road.

08:06.123 --> 08:08.987
I left him down there.

08:12.680 --> 08:21.450
Let's see.

08:22.031 --> 08:24.814
Getting dates for Aggies.

08:25.475 --> 08:28.199
Did you ever do the routine with the Tessies?

08:28.679 --> 08:29.961
No, I didn't do that.

08:30.101 --> 08:34.486
I was dating one or two girls in high school and I'd have my mother bring them up.

08:34.526 --> 08:41.995
They had several little widow ladies that had

08:41.975 --> 08:52.980
right here to South Gate that I would have my mother stay with and my date.

08:54.091 --> 08:55.093
So it was pretty nice.

08:55.113 --> 09:00.563
They'd have two or three bedrooms or maybe four bedrooms, you know, from a big home and family, and they were all gone.

09:00.603 --> 09:05.491
Do you have any idea what the fee was for that bed and breakfast?

09:05.572 --> 09:08.377
I don't know that the little lady, I didn't pay it.

09:08.397 --> 09:13.606
I left my mother gave her something, but I don't remember paying anything.

09:13.626 --> 09:15.289
It might have been free in my mind.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.505
Might have been because I don't remember or she might have charged $5 or something.

09:19.545 --> 09:20.166
I'm not sure.

09:20.286 --> 09:20.947
I don't remember.

09:21.248 --> 09:21.368
Right.

09:21.388 --> 09:24.652
When they came up, was it usually for Friday and Saturday night?

09:25.033 --> 09:25.934
Yes.

09:25.954 --> 09:27.376
Uh-huh.

09:27.396 --> 09:28.718
And for what kind of events?

09:30.140 --> 09:32.403
Well, just military balls.

09:32.423 --> 09:34.246
You know, that's, of course, all we had then.

09:34.286 --> 09:36.028
We didn't have the, so.

09:36.529 --> 09:41.175
How did Aggies behave at those events?

09:41.965 --> 09:50.860
If you had a real attractive young lady, the seniors would try to take over if you were a sophomore or freshman, which would happen a lot.

09:51.040 --> 09:56.309
And there was a lot of stories about the seniors leaving with your date and all that.

09:57.010 --> 10:01.237
I never had that happen, but anyway, there was a lot of stories about that.

10:01.317 --> 10:01.838
And how was it?

10:01.858 --> 10:03.761
But the girls were treated like what?

10:04.723 --> 10:06.606
Well, they were treated pretty good, you know.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.619
One or two people said like royalty.

10:08.940 --> 10:09.741
Yeah, they were.

10:10.443 --> 10:17.496
And because they had enough people hawking after them, you know, because everybody couldn't bring dates.

10:17.536 --> 10:19.560
I don't guess I had more than one or two up here.

10:20.722 --> 10:27.936
You know, when you just, and I'm not bragging about this, but when you just don't have the money to do those things, you know, and so it's,

10:28.979 --> 10:31.822
People were poor in those days, you know, in the 40s.

10:31.842 --> 10:33.084
Well, you grew up in those days.

10:34.365 --> 10:37.269
I'm the first person in the family who ever finished high school, let alone go to college.

10:37.409 --> 10:38.350
Right, you know.

10:40.853 --> 10:42.695
And this was big band music?

10:42.716 --> 10:43.597
Oh, yeah.

10:43.617 --> 10:44.998
Yeah, it was the big band stuff.

10:45.639 --> 10:48.723
And the dance lasted from until about what time?

10:48.743 --> 10:51.786
Until about 12, 12 or 1 sometimes, you know.

10:52.127 --> 10:55.611
Then where would the, where would the,

10:55.591 --> 11:02.125
After a dance, where did Aggies and their dates go?

11:03.269 --> 11:10.360
Normally in my instance, that's who you're interviewing, I just took them back to the dorm.

11:10.380 --> 11:17.110
I mean back to wherever they were staying because it wasn't without any transportation basically speaking.

11:18.913 --> 11:20.596
Wasn't too many places to go.

11:21.557 --> 11:28.568
Too many places stayed open that late around here except the old honky-tonks down in North Bryan someplace, you know.

11:28.801 --> 11:40.212
Now the kinds of bands that, what were some of the big bands that came to A&M in your ... I think they had Harry James and Glenn Miller and some of those people that came through here in those days.

11:40.792 --> 11:41.853
They had the big bands.

11:43.255 --> 11:44.276
They enjoyed playing here.

11:44.576 --> 11:45.897
You mentioned the Honky Tonks.

11:45.957 --> 11:46.778
Where were they?

11:47.198 --> 11:48.460
They were out on Highway 21.

11:49.581 --> 11:56.327
You know, we had Franklin's right down the road here, and Uncle Ed's over here on Welburn Road.

11:56.695 --> 11:59.144
Where was Uncle Ed's located for me?

11:59.927 --> 12:03.600
It's where that Chinese place is down there right now.

12:05.639 --> 12:09.183
By the Goodwill or wherever that place is, they sell it.

12:09.203 --> 12:09.723
Oh, okay.

12:10.204 --> 12:12.186
That brick, that little brick, you told them.

12:13.487 --> 12:15.709
Used to sell Chinese food in there or something.

12:16.810 --> 12:18.872
And Uncle Ed sold beer.

12:20.014 --> 12:21.035
Uh-huh.

12:21.135 --> 12:21.876
Nothing stronger.

12:22.176 --> 12:23.377
No.

12:24.198 --> 12:25.239
This was a dry county.

12:25.579 --> 12:26.460
Yeah.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.523
And students walked down there.

12:29.744 --> 12:32.186
Oh, yeah.

12:32.927 --> 12:34.328
Did he close at midnight?

12:34.528 --> 12:35.089
He wasn't open.

12:35.272 --> 12:36.474
Yeah, I think they had a law.

12:36.534 --> 12:39.458
He had to close at midnight or something like that.

12:39.478 --> 12:44.005
But the funny story about Uncle Ed, you could order a lone star.

12:44.025 --> 12:46.669
It had all long neck bottles then.

12:48.292 --> 12:51.597
And they were all in a big ice chest with water and all.

12:51.617 --> 12:54.361
And they had those paper labels on them.

12:54.381 --> 12:57.185
So you'd order a lone star and he'd go through.

12:57.205 --> 12:58.267
It'd be a Budweiser.

12:58.287 --> 12:58.868
Then he'd go through.

12:58.888 --> 13:00.891
It'd be a grand prize and it'd be...

13:01.343 --> 13:10.455
slits and then so he'd just go back to the Budweiser and slip the paper off and say Lone Star.

13:12.779 --> 13:14.501
So he always had what you wanted.

13:14.761 --> 13:18.627
All right then where was Franklin's?

13:19.688 --> 13:24.094
Franklin's was on Highway 60 about

13:24.597 --> 13:28.321
Just past the vet school before you got to 2818.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.684
And that was also beer only.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.947
Did either of those serve hamburgers, hot dogs?

13:33.987 --> 13:34.888
Franklin's did.

13:35.549 --> 13:36.750
But Uncle Ed's was only?

13:36.930 --> 13:39.373
I think it was just a beer joint, yeah.

13:39.393 --> 13:40.194
Best I remember.

13:41.055 --> 13:48.243
And did the place at Whiskey Bridge, did the place, everybody called Whiskey Bridge, did it have a name?

13:49.404 --> 13:50.385
Not to my knowledge.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.468
And it was just a little... Liquor store.

13:53.808 --> 13:56.852
It was there when you... It was just a little liquor store, yeah.

13:57.913 --> 14:00.537
That little building on the right as you cross the Brazos River.

14:01.738 --> 14:04.161
That got leveled within the last year and a half.

14:04.181 --> 14:04.421
Right, yeah.

14:04.762 --> 14:08.366
It was empty for a long time, but anyway, that's where it was.

14:09.207 --> 14:14.874
Now, the MSC was being planned... Uh-huh, and being built.

14:15.715 --> 14:16.997
It was completed in...

14:18.968 --> 14:21.691
52, I think, or maybe the latter part of 52.

14:23.313 --> 14:25.156
Was it completed while you were a student?

14:25.616 --> 14:25.797
No.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.541
I think we had gotten out before it was completed.

14:31.784 --> 14:36.870
Describe then what the YMCA was for students then.

14:37.952 --> 14:39.674
Well, the YMCA was about everything.

14:39.874 --> 14:43.879
It had a little soda place in it.

14:45.462 --> 14:49.347
and where you get coffee and sodas and hamburgers and that.

14:49.467 --> 14:54.794
And I think in the basement was a bowling alley, a one or two alley or three alley or something, bowling alley.

14:55.896 --> 15:05.868
And that's where the corps chaplain was, or not the corps, not the cadet, but just the chaplain was.

15:06.890 --> 15:13.258
So it was pretty handy to have and where a lot of us went there and then over on the,

15:14.437 --> 15:39.465
corner let me see about where the about where the Sammy Sanders building is there was a little place not any bigger than a mobile home where it was a I think they called it George's

15:41.082 --> 15:46.670
That was a coffee shop that we stopped a lot and drank coffee in there at the dorm area.

15:47.231 --> 15:48.492
I think they called it George's.

15:48.532 --> 15:49.133
I'm not sure.

15:50.275 --> 15:51.156
I think that's what it was.

15:51.737 --> 15:52.878
You said I drank coffee.

15:52.959 --> 15:54.561
Were you a coffee drinker at home?

15:55.001 --> 15:55.342
Oh, yeah.

15:55.602 --> 15:58.246
Okay, so you didn't become a coffee drinker up here?

15:58.266 --> 16:03.373
No, no, since I was about six years old, I guess, or seven or whatever it was when my daddy let me.

16:03.693 --> 16:07.479
Was it kind of masculine then pretty well for Aggies to drink coffee?

16:07.959 --> 16:08.440
Oh, yeah.

16:08.858 --> 16:09.199
Yeah.

16:09.841 --> 16:15.420
Well, they had soft drinks and all that in there too, but coffee was the main thing that everybody drank.

16:15.621 --> 16:18.430
Did you ever meet Mr. Cashin?

16:19.574 --> 16:21.256
No, I didn't meet him.

16:21.517 --> 16:23.319
I was going to ask you to describe him.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.101
Did you know either of his sons?

16:26.083 --> 16:26.904
Not in school.

16:27.184 --> 16:27.525
Oh, really?

16:27.685 --> 16:28.126
No.

16:28.146 --> 16:28.967
Were they before you?

16:30.228 --> 16:31.190
Or is Red after him?

16:31.210 --> 16:32.131
Jim was before me.

16:32.211 --> 16:33.312
Red was after me.

16:33.333 --> 16:33.673
Okay.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.896
Yeah, so I didn't get to meet them while I was here.

16:36.717 --> 16:42.645
The Quack Shack, did you ever have to go to the...

16:43.486 --> 16:45.168
I never went to the Quack Shack.

16:45.489 --> 16:56.585
What they used to do, though, is they would, before review, they'd fill their mouths with hot water and run to the Quack Shack, and when they'd get there, there'd be a fever.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.091
You know, they'd have a temperature when they got there, so they'd put them in bed.

17:00.151 --> 17:03.115
And the craziest story I heard,

17:04.462 --> 17:09.031
They put one guy back in the back of the hospital there.

17:09.051 --> 17:15.243
I forgot what he had, but anyway, it was like a week before they went back and found him back in there.

17:15.263 --> 17:17.667
A lot of stories like that.

17:17.688 --> 17:18.549
Guy in Hall.

17:19.611 --> 17:22.998
Guy in Hall.

17:23.018 --> 17:24.681
Graduated in Guy in Hall.

17:26.382 --> 17:35.937
It was a nice, well, it was starting to get old when we got out of school, but Hart Hall, of course, was right across the street.

17:36.799 --> 17:42.348
There was a window that they couldn't lock in the back, so we'd try to sneak in, and the guy would catch us most every time.

17:42.448 --> 17:43.910
We'd come out the front.

17:44.812 --> 17:45.994
Had all the movies in there.

17:46.014 --> 17:47.115
It was the movie theater.

17:47.817 --> 17:51.242
Wasn't but 20 cents or 10 cents or something like that.

17:52.252 --> 17:54.215
But we still try to sneak in the back.

17:55.176 --> 17:58.620
Did Aggies make any noise during movies and going home?

17:59.622 --> 18:02.686
They helped the players along.

18:02.746 --> 18:06.070
If it was getting rowdy or something, they'd chime in with them.

18:08.994 --> 18:12.218
But the noise they made was never... Turn that off a minute.

18:13.278 --> 18:14.380
But anyway, so.

18:15.321 --> 18:22.492
At Guyon Hall, did you or anybody else ever pull off any stunts or good bull in there?

18:23.073 --> 18:23.694
I never did.

18:23.714 --> 18:26.458
I don't think too many of us over there did.

18:26.498 --> 18:28.441
I didn't hear any real good stunts.

18:29.022 --> 18:33.609
But sometimes did cheer and sing and shout?

18:33.629 --> 18:35.572
Oh, yeah.

18:35.832 --> 18:36.413
Here you go.

18:37.675 --> 18:38.897
Let me think a minute.

18:43.332 --> 18:51.400
Ignorance is the curse of God.

18:52.561 --> 19:02.892
Wings, let's see, wings wherewith we fly to heaven.

19:04.934 --> 19:09.018
I missed a word or two in there, but that's what was the inscription on Guy and Hall.

19:09.038 --> 19:10.019
I used to remember that.

19:10.039 --> 19:13.002
That used to be the big Cush question.

19:14.365 --> 19:22.758
Ignorance is a curse of God and wings wherewith we fly to heaven, I think, or something like that.

19:23.119 --> 19:24.721
And it's all gone by the wayside.

19:24.761 --> 19:28.027
And that was a great saying, in my opinion.

19:28.047 --> 19:30.270
I wanted them to put it on the Bush Library.

19:30.891 --> 19:37.121
He was looking for something to put on the Bush Library, President Bush was.

19:38.163 --> 19:42.229
And I told somebody about it, which probably never got to him, but anyway.

19:43.677 --> 19:46.082
Would have been a great inscription on that library.

19:46.342 --> 20:01.230
And I've always thought that we made a blunder when we demolished Guyon and didn't leave those columns, that facade there, looking straight up military walk, and that would have been a marvelous north

20:02.155 --> 20:04.979
symbolic face of Rudder Tower.

20:05.219 --> 20:07.241
Yeah.

20:07.261 --> 20:07.462
Yeah.

20:07.642 --> 20:15.151
Do you remember seeing any famous people who came to appear or perform at Guyon?

20:16.133 --> 20:18.015
Bob Hope came here.

20:19.457 --> 20:21.559
I believe Bob Hope did one time.

20:21.579 --> 20:22.220
Did you see him?

20:22.280 --> 20:22.781
Do you remember?

20:22.801 --> 20:26.125
I can't remember whether I did or not.

20:27.887 --> 20:29.730
Did you see We've Never Been Licked?

20:30.070 --> 20:30.711
Yeah.

20:30.731 --> 20:31.572
Saw that here.

20:32.682 --> 20:33.705
And still have it.

20:36.835 --> 20:43.054
In general, the other thing we had here that they don't have any longer is we had Religious Emphasis Week.

20:43.074 --> 20:44.177
Yes, describe that.

20:45.237 --> 21:00.927
Religious emphasis week was in February and every day, Monday to Friday during that week, they'd have it Monday maybe 9 o'clock, Tuesday at 10, Wednesday at 1, so forth.

21:00.947 --> 21:04.393
There was a different hour each day so you wouldn't miss the same class.

21:05.318 --> 21:11.146
You'd go to Guy and Hall, and they had an hour of singing and religious, and they'd have a sermon.

21:11.406 --> 21:19.918
But we had Religious Emphasis Week here, and somebody would sing, you know, or anyway, it was a, which they don't have anymore.

21:20.178 --> 21:24.163
But anyway, I thought that was a very impressive deal, you know.

21:27.908 --> 21:29.971
Religious Emphasis Week, did you attend?

21:30.372 --> 21:30.752
Yes.

21:31.373 --> 21:36.924
Was there any kind of, in the Corps, was there any kind of compulsion that you had?

21:37.405 --> 21:37.465
No.

21:37.486 --> 21:38.989
No, no.

21:39.009 --> 21:40.512
Wasn't anything like that.

21:40.692 --> 21:45.903
It was just strictly a self attitude.

21:46.865 --> 21:50.412
And it was, I don't say it was full every time, but it was.

21:51.438 --> 21:52.379
well attended.

21:55.503 --> 21:57.606
Back to athletics for a second.

21:59.769 --> 22:06.537
Of all the football games that you saw as a student, were there any unforgettable moments?

22:08.460 --> 22:13.586
Just the big storm that came through here at the TCU game.

22:15.328 --> 22:16.750
I think that I went to that game.

22:16.790 --> 22:18.272
I'm trying to think now if that was

22:19.552 --> 22:22.158
I might have been out of school by then when that came through here.

22:22.338 --> 22:23.440
That might have been a little later.

22:23.460 --> 22:24.723
That was almost a tornado, wasn't it?

22:24.984 --> 22:25.244
Yeah.

22:28.150 --> 22:30.034
Describe Kyle Field at that time.

22:31.457 --> 22:33.662
Well it was one story.

22:34.469 --> 22:39.575
So all concrete in one story, it wasn't a big impressive.

22:39.956 --> 22:40.817
A little horseshoe.

22:40.977 --> 22:41.758
A little horseshoe.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.380
Were there any lights at all?

22:44.021 --> 22:45.042
No.

22:45.062 --> 22:46.204
Well, there were some lights.

22:46.484 --> 22:47.866
I don't know how good they were.

22:48.006 --> 22:49.528
But did they play any night games?

22:49.848 --> 22:49.908
No.

22:49.928 --> 22:50.929
It was all day games?

22:51.911 --> 22:52.271
Yeah.

22:52.291 --> 22:55.415
And you went to basketball games where?

22:55.695 --> 22:56.616
DeWear Fieldhouse.

22:56.636 --> 22:59.700
Describe DeWear, a typical Aggie game.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.704
DeWear had probably the best floor.

23:04.304 --> 23:15.438
anywhere in the country and it was so small that we had to go every other game.

23:16.058 --> 23:28.033
We were divided by alphabet so they took A to Z or A to L and L to Z or whatever because we couldn't all get in at one time.

23:28.452 --> 23:30.154
It was a lot of fun in there.

23:30.194 --> 23:34.158
The old field house was good, old, rickety, you know.

23:34.278 --> 23:36.500
It was old when we were here, you know.

23:36.581 --> 23:45.910
But anyway, we enjoyed it, but only half the troops could go at a time because it wasn't big enough for all of us to go.

23:46.691 --> 23:49.114
Who was the basketball coach then?

23:51.336 --> 23:56.481
I'm trying to think.

23:56.501 --> 23:58.003
I can't remember who.

23:59.097 --> 24:00.960
Let's see, was it Marty Corot?

24:01.500 --> 24:02.101
I believe it was.

24:02.201 --> 24:02.802
I believe it was.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.044
And were there?

24:04.364 --> 24:09.471
Yeah, my classmate's dad was the swimming coach, and I think Marty Corot was the basketball coach.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.212
I believe that's right.

24:11.754 --> 24:13.817
Yeah.

24:13.837 --> 24:18.364
And did you guys ever attempt any good bull or pranks at a basketball game?

24:18.584 --> 24:19.505
No, I don't think so.

24:19.525 --> 24:22.029
It was pretty well down the line.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.273
And baseball?

24:26.131 --> 24:28.634
Baseball was that little old field out there.

24:28.654 --> 24:29.515
Hadn't had very few.

24:29.755 --> 24:31.176
Probably could seat maybe a hundred.

24:31.517 --> 24:34.320
Right behind the football?

24:34.820 --> 24:36.062
Yeah.

24:36.082 --> 24:38.604
About where a parking lot is right now.

24:39.325 --> 24:42.008
And the fence was up here toward Kyle Field.

24:43.029 --> 24:45.712
And the home plate was out toward the highway.

24:46.913 --> 24:47.694
Face this way.

24:47.754 --> 24:50.477
Maybe a hundred seats out there or something like that.

24:50.537 --> 24:52.099
It wasn't very big.

24:52.119 --> 24:55.783
But it might have been.

24:56.270 --> 24:58.533
What was the status of a Yale leader then?

24:59.695 --> 25:00.576
Were they campus?

25:01.277 --> 25:02.319
Well, they were big time.

25:02.519 --> 25:03.240
They were big time?

25:03.260 --> 25:04.542
Yeah, they were very big time.

25:05.964 --> 25:14.396
Red Duke was the head Yale leader in 50, along with Glenn Kaufman, the past senator from San Antonio.

25:14.957 --> 25:16.499
They were the two senior Yale leaders.

25:16.619 --> 25:20.565
Describe Red Duke as an undergraduate Aggie.

25:21.787 --> 25:23.610
Well, he was in B troop jocks.

25:24.311 --> 25:25.973
B troop jocks.

25:26.138 --> 25:34.427
was disbanded about every other semester for frolicking around and getting themselves in trouble.

25:34.447 --> 25:39.593
And then they'd farm them up again and they would be... Disbanded again?

25:39.613 --> 25:40.614
Disbanded again.

25:41.536 --> 25:49.024
But they were, you never did notice it, but the cavalry

25:51.012 --> 26:01.365
insignia or their trademark was wearing their little caps down over their left eye, those little caps over their left eye.

26:02.627 --> 26:11.839
And if you've ever watched a, when he first got started when Red Duke was doing his TV,

26:12.292 --> 26:15.478
He had that scrub cap over that left eye, you know.

26:16.540 --> 26:25.475
And no one would have ever thought that Red Duke, in due respect to him, would have ever gone to missionary school or to medical school when he was a cadet here.

26:26.818 --> 26:29.042
Now, he was from, where was home?

26:29.543 --> 26:30.965
I do not know where he was from.

26:32.668 --> 26:36.595
Well, I don't think it was from any of the big cities, but I do not know where.

26:36.575 --> 26:44.387
And was he known as an academic leader, as a scholar?

26:44.467 --> 26:46.450
Not exactly.

26:48.252 --> 26:50.355
He was known as Good Time Charlie.

26:51.116 --> 26:54.101
You know, he was a... And did he have red hair in those days?

26:54.181 --> 26:54.782
Yes, oh yeah.

26:55.082 --> 26:56.504
So the red came naturally?

26:57.626 --> 26:59.629
Yes, and what happened is on...

27:00.925 --> 27:12.478
The building that was next door to where the Koch Building is now, there was a red brick building next to that.

27:14.280 --> 27:17.383
I can't think of the name of that, but it faced the Koch Building.

27:17.403 --> 27:18.444
It didn't face the streets.

27:19.225 --> 27:22.549
It faced the Koch Building.

27:22.569 --> 27:24.551
What's the name of that hall?

27:24.571 --> 27:25.692
It wasn't Bezell, was it?

27:27.775 --> 27:29.076
It might have been Bezell.

27:30.338 --> 27:34.162
But anyway, the steps were about this wide, going up and down.

27:35.884 --> 27:44.614
And that's where the Yale leaders would have Yale practice on occasion there in front of that building, because the Koch building, none of that was there from there to the YMCA.

27:46.876 --> 27:54.625
So what they had to do when they turned to talk through their deal, they had to bring one foot over because of that narrow step.

27:55.803 --> 28:08.460
Well, now that's where this funny thing is that Yale leaders do today of putting that one foot behind them, but in those days they had to step up and put it in front of it because of that narrow step.

28:09.201 --> 28:19.195
So from that has evolved whatever they do today, the Yale leaders, from some weird stance that they have, you know.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.479
And there wasn't any overalls in those days.

28:21.539 --> 28:23.482
There wasn't any of that stuff.

28:23.522 --> 28:33.358
It was all very, you know, the white uniforms and they were very, very respected in those days.

28:33.558 --> 28:36.864
Fulbright and red and all that punch.

28:36.884 --> 28:46.279
In the, in that, in your student days, what student office position carried the most prestige?

28:48.284 --> 28:51.028
I think in my day it was the Yale leaders, I'd have to say.

28:51.208 --> 28:52.230
More than corps commander?

28:53.592 --> 29:00.863
Well, no, the corps commander was probably the most outstanding ever, but the Yale leaders were probably next.

29:03.287 --> 29:10.478
Corps staff, the common, the corps commander was good.

29:12.500 --> 29:20.357
had McClure was one corps commander, 49 I think, and then in 50 was A.D.

29:20.397 --> 29:26.070
Martin from Dallas.

29:27.383 --> 29:29.026
He was very outstanding.

29:29.266 --> 29:38.804
He flew his own airplane in here in 47 when he entered school, so he was earmarked for the Corps commander when he landed, you know.

29:38.824 --> 29:41.108
Not really, but anyway, he's just a good guy.

29:41.770 --> 29:47.400
Was there even an office known as President of the Student Body?

29:51.886 --> 29:52.908
I can't remember.

29:53.369 --> 29:54.411
There probably was.

29:54.571 --> 29:57.217
But there was a senior, there was a class president.

29:57.237 --> 30:01.345
There was a class president, and then I think the Corps commander was just the big time.

30:01.545 --> 30:03.489
There might not have been a student body president.

30:04.431 --> 30:09.962
Were you aware at that era, were you aware of the existence of secret fraternities?

30:10.938 --> 30:12.320
No, because I wasn't in one.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.262
There was something called the TTs.

30:15.163 --> 30:17.426
I don't really know what that was.

30:17.606 --> 30:23.634
I wasn't involved in it, so I tried not to be, you know, but I don't know what that was.

30:23.794 --> 30:28.760
I know there were some kids kicked out of school because they were in it or lost their commissions anyway.

30:29.281 --> 30:29.481
All right.

30:29.501 --> 30:31.784
Did you ever hear anything about the stickers in that era?

30:31.864 --> 30:32.025
No.

30:33.486 --> 30:34.768
You know what I'm talking about, too?

30:36.605 --> 30:37.746
Okay.

30:37.767 --> 30:38.868
What about steam tunnels?

30:38.948 --> 30:41.131
Did you and your buddies know about steam tunnels?

30:41.151 --> 30:42.553
Yeah, we knew about the steam tunnels.

30:42.593 --> 30:49.061
That's the way you drowned out the dorm because you'd go through the steam tunnels and turn on all the water.

30:49.101 --> 30:53.226
First, you'd go up and turn the water off in the steam tunnels.

30:53.246 --> 31:01.397
Then you'd go up and uncap all the commodes and then go back down in the tunnel and turn the water on and then run like heck.

31:02.963 --> 31:05.508
In those days, there wasn't but five or six KKs.

31:06.330 --> 31:08.374
So they didn't have much of a chance on catching you.

31:10.158 --> 31:11.401
But there's a lot different today.

31:11.421 --> 31:13.425
I don't know what they've done.

31:13.445 --> 31:16.872
As far as you know, a person could have gone into the steam.
