WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:06.615
with General Joe Hanover. Today's date is 29 of 
July, 1980. This is part of the project of Aggies to

00:12.264 --> 00:17.572
General. This is Terry Anderson. This is a test.

00:25.544 --> 00:30.151
This is an interview with Brigadier General Joe G. 
Hanover. Today is Tuesday, July 29th. This is

00:33.275 --> 00:34.336
Terry Anderson. Let's start with your upbringing 
and your parents. You were born in McGregor,

00:36.478 --> 00:41.203
Texas, February 10, 1918. Could you tell me about 
your father? Well, my father was Grady Hanover,

00:44.646 --> 00:50.492
which I've taken my middle name from. In fact, I'm a 
junior. My father was a hardworking laborer in

00:53.896 --> 01:00.362
McGregor, Texas. part owner of a cotton gin and 
also in a grain elevator type operation which

01:01.844 --> 01:27.700
serviced the local economy down there in McLennan 
County he worked hard at this gin which everybody

01:01.844 --> 01:27.700
does it is seasonal very seasonal and I don't 
remember a great deal about the early years in

01:28.203 --> 01:32.509
McGregor because I left there when I was seven 
years old. The cause of our leaving was my father's

01:33.771 --> 01:57.383
gin burned and he and his partner I'm sure owed a 
good bit of money on it and according to my father he

01:33.771 --> 01:57.383
told his partner that if he would take the 
assumption of the debt and take the insurance that

01:33.771 --> 01:57.383
was available and just free him that he would turn 
his part over to him. And then his father lived in

01:58.274 --> 02:04.601
Wheelock, Texas, which is just north of Bryan or 
northeast of Bryan. So your grandfather did.

02:06.243 --> 02:07.765
That's right, my grandfather. And he was getting 
to the point that he needed someone to help him with

02:07.925 --> 02:13.231
his farm. He had about a 1,400-acre farm that had 
cattle and sharecroppers. So my father moved to

02:18.897 --> 02:22.982
Wheelock in 1925. to assist his father with the 
operation of the cattle farm and the sharecropper

02:23.266 --> 02:34.979
farming and that's how we got down back down in this 
area. My father was a hard-working fellow and he

02:35.060 --> 02:42.929
raised us four children. I'm the oldest of four. I 
have two brothers and one sister and we lived on

02:44.310 --> 02:50.337
this farm for many, many years, in fact, until I 
started to A&M. My mother was a very devout

02:56.093 --> 03:11.649
Christian lady who gave all of us the loving, 
tender care that a mother should and provided the

02:56.093 --> 03:11.649
type of home life that you think you should grow up 
in. She and my father had a very wholesome

03:13.171 --> 03:20.138
household, and we think we were very fortunate in 
the heritage that we had. Now, does your heritage

03:20.641 --> 03:27.191
in Texas go way back into the 1900s or before? Oh, 
yes, before that. I mean the 1800s. Yeah, let me. My

03:33.281 --> 03:44.078
great-grandfather came to Texas in the 1830s from 
the Maine area.

03:44.519 --> 03:48.505
His parents had migrated from England. the name 
Hanover started in Germany went to England and

03:48.704 --> 04:15.910
then I guess it's my great-great-grandparents my 
great-great-grandfather came from England to

03:48.704 --> 04:15.910
Maine he was in the Navy in the English Navy the 
story is that he retired of the Navy and jumped

03:48.704 --> 04:15.910
overboard and walked ashore swam ashore or 
something but anyhow that up in the Maine and

03:48.704 --> 04:15.910
Massachusetts area But he came to Texas in 1835, 
1836, somewhere in the middle 1800s. He was a

04:22.926 --> 04:29.174
surveyor, and he came this way following the 
railroads and doing survey work. So where my

04:30.215 --> 04:34.080
heritage goes. About the time of the Texas 
Revolution. That's right, to the early 1800s.

04:38.485 --> 04:44.192
Now, when you say that your mother was religious, 
Was she more religious than your father? And what

04:47.417 --> 04:48.538
religion was it? My mother was a Baptist.

04:53.625 --> 04:57.349
My father never really belonged to any church, per 
se. He was a kind and loving father, but he just

04:57.550 --> 05:06.861
never saw fit to be a member of the church. My mother 
was, but they still had a very wholesome

05:07.162 --> 05:12.829
relationship. Could you tell me about your 
mother's heritage? Yes, in fact, my mother was

05:16.434 --> 05:20.719
born at Allen Farm. You know where Allen Farm is? 
It's about 15 miles south of College Station, down

05:22.241 --> 05:27.146
in Brazos County. The Moore brothers have big 
farms down there at this particular time. But she

05:33.873 --> 05:42.462
was born right here in Brazos County, in the lower 
part of the county.

05:43.049 --> 05:49.816
When she was very young, her mother and father 
moved to Belton, but they were in Texas. I think her

05:51.158 --> 05:54.742
father was born here, but I'm not real sure about 
that. But they had been here for a good few years.

05:58.786 --> 06:02.090
Okay.

06:02.110 --> 06:06.174
If your mother was religious, did religion play a 
large role in your upbringing? Yes. Some of my

06:09.398 --> 06:11.520
earliest memories of the church my mother was a 
pianist she played the church yes and i've told the

06:12.732 --> 06:41.473
in fact the preacher that was our our preacher 
there at that in mcgregor at that time has died

06:12.732 --> 06:41.473
within the last year here in bryan and i've told him 
many times my early remembrance of church is

06:12.732 --> 06:41.473
laying on the bench behind the piano because my 
mother put me there while she played, but my father

06:41.791 --> 07:03.051
used to say every time the doors of the church 
opened my mother was there, but we were all taught

06:41.791 --> 07:03.051
that we needed to be in church and Sunday school on 
Sunday, so my mother usually had us there. Could

07:03.672 --> 07:05.954
you tell me about your parents' education? My 
mother had little formal education. She was

07:12.213 --> 07:21.987
fortunate enough to go to Baylor, Mary Hardin 
Baylor in Belton, which was a girls' school at that

07:12.213 --> 07:21.987
time. And I think for a year or some such thing that 
I'm sure finances kept her from going to school.

07:29.477 --> 07:37.929
But somewhere down the line, she learned to play 
the piano and was quite a musician and taught music

07:29.477 --> 07:37.929
many years later on. My father had formal 
education of a business school which was pretty

07:40.381 --> 07:47.349
prevalent during those times back there. He went 
to a business school in Waco and- Did he go to high-

07:48.410 --> 07:53.796
did he finish high school and then go to a business 
school? I'm sure it was about a 10th grade high

07:54.137 --> 08:01.425
school or some such thing but they called it high 
school. He finished what was available out in the

08:04.512 --> 08:18.127
rural area which was probably in the 10th grade or 
some such thing and then took a business college

08:04.512 --> 08:18.127
business course so that was the extent of his 
formal education. Uh could you tell me about uh how

08:18.147 --> 08:32.362
would you characterize your father I mean you say 
he's hard working could you

08:18.147 --> 08:32.362
continue on that thing? Well What kind of person 
was he?

08:39.275 --> 08:45.463
He was a fellow that was very concerned about the 
welfare of his family.

08:48.027 --> 09:01.485
His many years that I knew him and beginning with 
this work at the gin and this grain elevator in

08:48.027 --> 09:01.485
McGregor he personally was there to see that the 
work was being done the employees that worked for

09:02.157 --> 09:09.429
him he was always there to be helpful and tell them 
what he expected. Of course out on the farm it was

09:09.449 --> 09:27.861
basically he and we boys plus the sharecroppers 
who back in those days if the farm owner owned the

09:09.449 --> 09:27.861
teams and tools the sharecroppers worked on the 
hay. if the sharecroppers had their own teams and

09:28.567 --> 09:54.034
tools they worked on what they called third and 
fourth they got a third of the cotton and a fourth of

09:28.567 --> 09:54.034
the corn a lesser amount because they I mean a more 
amount because they finished their own equipment

09:28.567 --> 09:54.034
but my dad was up early he uh he tried to instill in us 
the necessity for being diligent and dependable

09:54.436 --> 10:00.362
and know how to work even though we were not the Red 
Winners. We had our chores. We had to bring the wood

10:02.445 --> 10:14.678
in and we had to milk the cows and we had to feed the 
horses and, you know, the farm type chores, but he

10:02.445 --> 10:14.678
expected us to do our part and... He put 
responsibility on you early then? He did, yes. In

10:18.241 --> 10:23.447
fact, I started milking cows or helping milk when I 
was seven years old. and uh but he gave us the chores

10:23.714 --> 10:48.658
and he wasn't one of these that stand right over you 
know and tell you everything to do but he'd tell you

10:23.714 --> 10:48.658
what he expected and the end product and then if you 
didn't get it well you know he'd talk to you but he he

10:23.714 --> 10:48.658
could be a pretty stern when he needs to be I

10:23.714 --> 10:48.658
don't remember being punished by him very many 
times, but the time he did, well, you know, he

10:49.448 --> 10:57.179
didn't laugh at all.

10:57.200 --> 10:57.260
No. He was a disciplinarian when it came to the 
parents. My mother, I guess typical of boys, they

11:00.224 --> 11:06.954
always thought their mothers were joking. He was 
the authority in the family then? Well, that's

11:10.519 --> 11:12.222
probably right. As far as you know, what had to be 
done, and if there was some law laid down, well, he

11:14.170 --> 11:19.821
was the one that did it. My mother was kind and 
gentle, and she might give you a little switching

11:20.041 --> 11:28.958
of the peach limb, but that wasn't the way it was, 
and Daddy did it. Yeah, right. And you tell me about

11:31.202 --> 11:33.526
the sharecroppers that you mentioned. How many 
sharecroppers did you have? Well, I look back on it

11:36.766 --> 11:40.672
now and I really don't see how they did it. These 
1,400 acres that they had, there were probably,

11:40.692 --> 11:49.146
I'd say, 300 acres that were cultivation. The rest 
of it was grass and they ran cattle on it. But I can

11:53.172 --> 11:59.802
remember one time there were 12 families that were 
sharecroppers on that 300 acres. And that sounds

12:00.183 --> 12:01.825
incredible. I just don't know. But a lot of them is 
one colored family that all seem like they must

12:04.289 --> 12:11.076
have eight or 10 children. Think about where they 
all black, all the sharecroppers. But to think

12:17.423 --> 12:27.554
about 12 families making their living on these 300 
couldn't have been over 400 or 400 acres. But I just

12:28.756 --> 12:31.799
it's just almost incredible. My father, operated 
a little commissary farm that's a little store

12:33.854 --> 12:52.572
that where they provided the beans and coffee and 
flour and this sort of thing and the sharecroppers

12:33.854 --> 12:52.572
reimbursed them in the fall. and their crops were 
gathered. So really it was a sort of a little store

12:55.233 --> 12:59.158
on a credit farm. They got their staple goods 
there. And there was one thing that I guess helped a

13:02.462 --> 13:05.085
little. Most of those sharecroppers, my father 
would let them raise pigs or chickens or maybe

13:05.105 --> 13:13.616
raise a cow or two around their home. So it wasn't 
totally from the land, I mean from the cultivation

13:13.716 --> 13:21.445
that they made their living. so where they were 
enterprising sharecroppers they had an

13:21.998 --> 13:29.788
opportunity to grow a lot of what they eat. How long 
did sharecroppers last? How long did you own the

13:31.751 --> 13:34.094
farm and did they last? Well the farm was owned 
clear up until 1942 and my grandfather had

13:34.374 --> 13:50.655
acquired this 1400 acres over the years by 100 
acres and 200 and you know put together this 1400

13:51.445 --> 14:02.538
acres over, I would say probably a good many years, 
but I know that he had owned a lot of it since the

13:51.445 --> 14:02.538
early 1900s. So he had started acquiring it back in 
the 1800s and it was finally sold in 1942. But the

14:12.469 --> 14:20.659
sharecroppers had begun to dwindle prior to their 
selling and he had turned most of that into

14:12.469 --> 14:20.659
grazing. where you could just raise stock. Why'd 
they do them though? They went to town. They went to

14:26.165 --> 14:28.328
places and got jobs. Just the same thing that 
countrywide people have left the farm. Yeah,

14:34.717 --> 14:35.478
right. Looking for an easier life. Must have been a 
tough life for those people. And they worked hard.

14:45.452 --> 14:49.718
Of course, they'd get up, you know, they were in the 
fields when daylight came. They were in the fields

14:50.137 --> 14:53.082
to dark. That's just what it took. Yeah.

15:01.276 --> 15:04.521
Could you tell me about your two brothers and one 
sister? How'd you get along with them? Well, what

15:06.845 --> 15:07.767
were their ages? Let's start with that first, and 
then how'd you get along with them? The next

15:11.674 --> 15:15.520
brother under me is two years younger than I am. and 
the brother under him is five years younger than

15:16.495 --> 15:35.424
he, which is seven years younger than I am, and then 
her sister was four years younger than the third

15:16.495 --> 15:35.424
brother, so we were within an 11 year span.

15:36.565 --> 15:41.693
Oh, I guess we had the usual differences the 
brothers did. Generally, we got along well. We had

15:44.899 --> 15:48.282
our little spats and arguments and whatnot. It was 
real strange. We also had a cousin, a first cousin,

15:51.925 --> 15:58.652
who was orphaned. And my grandfather took him in to 
raise him. And he was a year older than I. And it's

16:08.862 --> 16:09.943
real strange. We three boys would have our 
arguments and differences. But when we had

16:14.292 --> 16:20.400
arguments with the cousins, the three of us pooled 
together. But we had quite an interesting

16:20.420 --> 16:25.147
upbringing. And we had a bunch of other cousins 
that lived out in the rural area, and we'd get

16:25.167 --> 16:31.937
together and just have great times. So I'd say we 
were average congenial and had on well. Of course,

16:39.048 --> 16:43.174
we were all real proud when her little sister came 
home. We said she was spoiled and petted and

16:43.194 --> 16:48.623
whatnot, but we had a pretty congenial family. 
What happened to your two brothers? What did they

16:50.766 --> 16:53.330
do in later life? Well, the second oldest went to 
A&M for a couple three years, dropped out. He

17:03.706 --> 17:07.452
changed courses a time or two and got behind, I 
guess, his other constituents and so he dropped

17:08.444 --> 17:32.545
out and and went to work and subsequently went in 
the service he was an armor soldier got a

17:08.444 --> 17:32.545
battlefield commission was uh when was this 
during the war he was he got his battlefield

17:08.444 --> 17:32.545
commission on in December of 45, which was right in 
the height of the last phases of the war. 44. You're

17:41.061 --> 17:45.568
right. 44, of course. 44. December 44. And got a 
battlefield commission, and shortly

17:51.057 --> 18:00.912
thereafter, he was in a tank that got three German 
88 shells through it. three of the five out of the

18:01.853 --> 18:30.831
tank were killed and he fortunately was not killed 
but was severely wounded and lost an eye and had

18:01.853 --> 18:30.831
shrapnel all over him and got superficial burns 
not you know something detrimental to him and was

18:01.853 --> 18:30.831
brought back to the states for recovery and then he 
subsequently went in law enforcement but as a

18:01.853 --> 18:30.831
deputy sheriff here in this county and still lives 
here in brian The second brother, who was the

18:32.262 --> 18:40.452
youngest of all of us, was the first one in the 
service, the first one in the war. He left high

18:40.553 --> 18:43.697
school and joined the Navy. Really? He got in 
before you did? That's right. That's real

18:48.323 --> 18:50.145
strange. Yeah, that is. Well, let me take that 
back. He got in the combat area before I left. Oh, I

18:58.530 --> 18:58.890
see. He went in, he must have gone in in 42. I was 
actually in the service, but I was in the States

19:02.916 --> 19:08.084
training soldiers. But he had the good fortune of 
serving on the battleship New Jersey. that was the

19:20.525 --> 19:43.292
flagship of Spruance and Halsey and whatnot and he 
was a fire control NCO or a fire control technician

19:20.525 --> 19:43.292
right and I had a very I would I would guess a very 
interesting World War II service of course he's in

19:20.525 --> 19:43.292
the Pacific most of the time but service on those 
big battle wagons must have been much better than

19:43.677 --> 20:12.908
the dog faces laying in the trenches but he stayed 
in fact he went in I guess he was he was only about 17

19:43.677 --> 20:12.908
or 18 when he went in so he was in the new on the New 
Jersey throughout the entire he went to I guess

19:43.677 --> 20:12.908
Norfolk or somewhere over there where it was 
actually built and went on it from Shakedown

20:13.158 --> 20:15.821
Cruise. So he was on it from its maiden voyage right 
on to the time he got this church out of service.

20:25.634 --> 20:29.319
And then the sister uh what did he do later in life? 
Uh he he came back to this area and uh he went in the

20:30.040 --> 20:34.946
lumber business. Oh really? He first traveled and 
sold lumber for a good many years for a big concern

20:36.007 --> 20:42.135
out of San Antonio and then decided that he could 
sell to other people except himself so a number of

20:42.892 --> 20:57.713
years later he actually went into the lumber 
business and has his own business now and has had it

20:42.892 --> 20:57.713
for a number of years in Austin. Oh really? Which 
one is it? It's called Hanover Lumber Company. In

21:01.839 --> 21:02.380
Austin? It's uh well it's out to the east of Austin 
but it's had a very interesting career in the

21:11.613 --> 21:13.915
business for himself. He has four children and 
three of them work with him in the business. That's

21:19.680 --> 21:23.604
sort of interesting.

21:23.624 --> 21:34.594
And the sister went to Texas University, got her 
degree and went to Corpus, I mean went to... What

21:23.624 --> 21:34.594
was her degree? Education. She was a school 
teacher. Went down to Port Arthur. and went into

21:42.646 --> 21:55.528
the school system down there and met a young man who 
was working for Guff Oil Company and they were

21:42.646 --> 21:55.528
married subsequently and she taught a year or two 
and then she became a housewife. So she's

21:56.510 --> 21:59.034
continued living in Port Arthur ever since. The 
youngest brother, the one who went in the Navy,

22:00.437 --> 22:04.063
never did go to college. So there really were three 
of us, two of us graduated the second and had a

22:05.714 --> 22:13.306
limited amount of college work. Now there must 
have been some episodes earlier in your life that

22:14.828 --> 22:24.543
you feel had sort of a significant impact on your 
later life or your career. Were there? Yes, and

22:26.987 --> 22:33.477
it's real funny I think, I hear so many people talk 
about They never didn't know what they wanted to do

22:34.064 --> 22:41.656
until they actually got out of school or even 
halfway through college. I had a specific college

22:42.658 --> 22:48.086
career in mind before I got out of high school. 
Really? That is unusual. Well long before that in

22:51.612 --> 22:59.785
1929 and at that time I was 11 years old The Old San 
Antonio Road, which is the borderline between

23:02.127 --> 23:08.676
these two counties. Are you familiar with what 
road that is? It's about halfway from here to

23:11.800 --> 23:13.503
Hearn. Is that Old Service Road or OSR now? That's 
right. The OSR. Is that? I've been on that road. Is

23:20.853 --> 23:21.213
that? That's what it is. What is it? OSR? Old San 
Antonio Road. Old San Antonio? I just thought it

23:25.719 --> 23:27.562
said for Old Service Road. Old San Antonio. Old San 
Antonio Road. It was called in the Spanish times El

23:30.781 --> 23:37.450
Camino Real but later became what you call the old 
San Antonio. It was San Antonio to Nacogdoches

23:37.470 --> 23:39.753
Trail. Sure sure which was one of the oldest. 
That's right. In fact it's built in the 1700s. Way

23:45.680 --> 23:51.488
back way back yeah and our home was was adjacent to 
that. It followed our property for about two

23:51.568 --> 23:53.811
miles. A little side issue you're talking about 
OSR that's the only road in the state of Texas

23:57.308 --> 24:25.982
that's referred to by that type of designation 
every other is a number but it is OSR officially but

23:57.308 --> 24:25.982
we lived on this road in 1929 the highway 
department undertook to regrade it gravel it and

23:57.308 --> 24:25.982
put a surface on it in other words make a highway out 
of it And I got fascinated with the survey crew that

24:26.907 --> 24:37.582
was doing the survey work on that road and said to my 
people and everybody, I want to be a civil

24:26.907 --> 24:37.582
engineer. That was 11 years old. I graduated from 
high school, went to A&M, enrolled in civil

24:42.508 --> 24:47.515
engineering and got a degree. So when I was 11 years 
old, I said what I was going to take in college and

24:48.406 --> 24:55.821
did it. And that's a little unusual. And basically 
it was because you were stimulated right there on

24:58.245 --> 25:02.754
the road. I followed that survey crew as far as I 
could walk, you know, and then come back home, but

25:02.815 --> 25:10.650
just was fascinated with them. Why do you think 
that was? Because, you know, kids see firemen who

25:12.025 --> 25:23.941
are 11 and say, gee, I'd like to be a fireman when I 
grow up, or they, you know, they might see an

25:12.025 --> 25:23.941
engineer crew, or they might see a number of, they 
might see a man in uniform and say, I'd love to be a

25:12.025 --> 25:23.941
general. Why do you think that was? I really don't 
know. It just, just one of those things that, that

25:28.027 --> 25:39.523
the work they were doing, and then the subsequent 
work that followed it, building that road, I

25:28.027 --> 25:39.523
stayed out there just, days upon the end, you know, 
and it was crude as compared to today's methods.

25:45.587 --> 25:45.928
Sure. Mule-drawn scrapers. Were they? Yes, sir. 
Mule-drawn scrapers. They had some mechanical

25:52.839 --> 26:04.498
tractors, I mean tractors with motors and 
whatnot, but most of the dirt work was done with

25:52.839 --> 26:04.498
mule-drawn scrapers, and that fascinated me. And 
I knew it all started with this survey crew. That's

26:09.819 --> 26:11.702
just the kind of thing I wanted to do. Did you talk to 
any of the workers? Oh, gosh, I was just right in

26:13.365 --> 26:16.571
their hair. We even provided a place for them to 
board their mules and horses. My father provided a

26:25.690 --> 26:36.327
corral where they could come up at night as long as 
they were within commuting distance, you know,

26:25.690 --> 26:36.327
long, within a three or four mile area. He'd 
provide them a corral and a place for them to keep

26:36.347 --> 26:44.440
their feed and they could water and bed down their 
work animals at night. And further than that, And

26:47.527 --> 26:51.592
he provided them an area to put their tent up where 
they could stay. See, they lived in tents at that

26:51.612 --> 26:54.997
time because they couldn't commute anywhere. It 
was too far. And my mother boarded these road

26:56.699 --> 27:03.909
hands, fed them for a price, you know. She fed them 
for weeks at a time. And, you know, gosh, I thought

27:06.993 --> 27:10.598
they'd made for me. and I talked with them and lived 
with them and I'd go down their tent at night and

27:11.152 --> 27:19.944
we'd sit around and they'd tell me the biggest bull 
story, you know. So it's just... What kind of

27:21.706 --> 27:23.368
people were they? Just, just across the board 
laborers. There were, there were, there were some

27:28.094 --> 27:33.662
whites, some blacks. They worked an integrated 
crew then? Oh yes, oh yes. And just, just real

27:41.105 --> 27:47.313
down-to-earth, hard-working people that were 
trying to make a living. And as I say, they'd be gone

27:47.534 --> 27:51.339
from home a week at a time. They'd come out there and 
stay all week, live in this tent. My mother would

27:56.225 --> 28:08.462
feed them, and on weekends, they'd pull five of 
them and get them all day forward and commute back

27:56.225 --> 28:08.462
to wherever their home was and spend the day with 
their folks and then come back. So I guess it just

28:08.932 --> 28:15.378
ingrained it in me, I don't know. But the 
construction aspect of it just didn't seem to suit

28:15.398 --> 28:19.422
me.

28:22.666 --> 28:31.775
It seems to me that you and your two brothers and 
sister all have had successful careers. In which

28:32.415 --> 28:37.200
ways do you think that your parents are 
responsible for that? Well, when I got ready to go

28:38.952 --> 28:52.450
to A&M, my father told me, he said, I do not have the 
financial means to send you to A&M. See, I started

28:52.470 --> 28:58.498
in 1936, which was just coming out of the 
Depression. But he said, I'll tell you what I can

28:58.518 --> 29:00.420
do. He said, you can stay at home. I can board you. I 
can provide you with food and a place to live if you

29:04.837 --> 29:12.473
can find some way to commute back and forth. My 
grandfather had an old 1929 Chevrolet. He told me,

29:17.343 --> 29:22.273
he said, if you can get enough people to ride with 
you to help pay your expenses, I was sort of

29:22.962 --> 29:26.389
mechanically inclined. He said, I believe you 
could keep the old car up, and you can take that car

29:26.430 --> 29:37.714
and use it if you can commute back and forth and use 
it for your transportation. Well, I did. I got

29:39.312 --> 29:41.936
people that were interested in going back for it. 
Some of them were students. Some of them worked at

29:43.920 --> 29:44.461
A&M. Triple A was in B&M. That was part of the 
agriculture program. And I always had a load of

29:50.191 --> 29:53.216
people that wanted to go. And I'd gather them up in 
the morning after I milked seven cows, gather them

29:53.296 --> 29:59.247
up, head to A&M. go to school all day, and I worked. I 
worked for the landscape department on the

30:02.177 --> 30:05.380
grounds. Doing anything I had to do. I picked 
mealybugs off the chrysanthemums, I dug in the

30:08.543 --> 30:19.612
flowerbeds, I hauled compost out of the Calvary 
stables. You know, whatever there was to do, I was

30:19.632 --> 30:25.358
ready, because I wanted to go to school. And I got 30 
cents an hour. And I was allowed to work. Which was

30:32.036 --> 30:33.998
above minimum wage actually. I think it was. It 
was. The first minimum wage went in in 37 and that

30:36.241 --> 30:42.308
was only 25 cents an hour. Well we were paid. Or 38, 
1938. Well we were getting 30 at that time and I was

30:44.831 --> 30:49.816
allowed to work 40 hours a month. A day student 
could work 40 hours a month. That's right. And that

30:54.402 --> 30:57.145
gave me $12 a month. And that made the difference in 
homeschool. Had I not gotten that $12 a month, I

31:00.955 --> 31:05.400
couldn't have made it. Because that brought my 
little books and paper and pencils and whatnot.

31:12.087 --> 31:15.531
And I owned one cow that my grandfather had given 
me. She had one calf a year. And I sold that calf in

31:18.554 --> 31:26.322
time each year to pay my $50 or whatever it was for 
the... what do you call it
