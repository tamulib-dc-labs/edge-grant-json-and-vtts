WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:04.943
of College Station, July 11th, 1983. Okay.

00:08.086 --> 00:17.695
You were saying that on, what was right here at the, 
I guess the east end of A&M, what was that like? Pig

00:19.156 --> 00:19.857
Farm was up there. Was it, did it belong to the A&M 
campus? Yes, it was. Here where the golf course is,

00:25.202 --> 00:28.485
cows was there.

00:31.807 --> 00:33.349
Did they have horses or? Well, the horse bond was up 
on the other side of the main building up here. Mr.

00:41.139 --> 00:43.943
Garrigan was the horse man. D.W. Williams was the 
head of the animal husbandry.

00:52.574 --> 00:56.539
And all of that walk put down on the other side of the 
main building. Mr. McNew's brother-in-law laid

00:58.402 --> 01:00.885
that. His name was Murray. He was in Middlewell, 
Texas. When the chemistry building was built, I

01:07.003 --> 01:12.595
remember that.

01:12.615 --> 01:21.574
Well, did the hogs and the cows, were they used to 
feed people on campus, or was it more like an

01:12.615 --> 01:21.574
experiment station? Well, I imagine they 
experimented on them, with them, and I imagine

01:21.638 --> 01:26.824
they killed some. But it wasn't nothing but hogs. 
They used to get all the garbage from the mess hole

01:27.985 --> 01:31.529
and feed those hogs. I mean hogs, big hogs. Were 
hogs raised in the community around College

01:34.532 --> 01:40.419
Station? Anywhere else? Well, outlying people, 
like down on the other side of Washington Chapel.

01:47.406 --> 01:48.928
Well, all of that land

01:53.313 --> 01:57.499
It's down there, uh-huh. All that land back down on 
the side of where you read them, that belonged to

01:57.519 --> 02:03.547
blacks.

02:06.651 --> 02:07.873
Along the chapel? It belonged to blacks. 
Washington Chapel. Mm-hmm. There was black name

02:11.017 --> 02:15.083
after black name. The land behind it was 
Richardson. D. Richardson. All the way back to the

02:20.531 --> 02:22.273
bypass. Oh, really? Richardson, was he black 
also? He died. His wife died.

02:32.237 --> 02:33.679
The house was given away. The land was? In a way. Did 
these people farm? Yes, they farmed. Did they

02:40.585 --> 02:46.391
trade their crops with A&M, or did they take them 
into Bryan? They had cotton,

02:46.411 --> 02:50.995
etc. Had to take it to the gym. Well crops that they 
raised, whatever vegetables. Corn and stuff like

02:58.858 --> 03:01.202
that. Did they ever sell that to A&M College? No, it 
wasn't. They raised just enough to supply the

03:05.088 --> 03:08.693
family. Oh, I see. Okay, but what they made their 
money from was cotton. And working on the campus.

03:18.789 --> 03:18.889
Okay. I guess we were also talking about Bryan, and 
you made a good point that the A&M College provided

03:19.358 --> 03:31.251
jobs for people who lived in Bryan. Is that right? 
Still do. They still do, right. Did Bryan, do you

03:37.959 --> 03:48.471
feel like they treated the people differently 
that lived around the college? The bribed people?

03:51.740 --> 03:52.180
Well, yes. Because they felt like they had better 
paying jobs than the bribed.

04:03.815 --> 04:07.459
So there was a sense of rivalry between the two 
people? Well, no. They just seemed as if they had a

04:08.580 --> 04:16.450
little more respect for the guys out here on the 
campus Mr. Redwood beat up guys down in Brown. He

04:20.455 --> 04:21.236
didn't do nothing. He was on the campus. He worked. 
He had a job. He made money.

04:28.724 --> 04:30.065
And you're talking about all people. You're not 
just talking about the black community? Well, I

04:34.090 --> 04:36.272
can only answer for the black community. Oh, OK. 
Because I didn't know too much about the white

04:36.933 --> 04:41.117
community in Brown. But I knew about the white 
community here. That's right. That's right.

04:51.938 --> 05:04.036
Well, the reason I was asking these questions is, 
you know, it could have easily have gone this way,

04:51.938 --> 05:04.036
that Bryan had incorporated this land into their 
city, and yet it didn't. It became its own town, and

05:04.257 --> 05:08.523
I was just curious as to why that happened. I'm glad 
you didn't. Why is that?

05:15.273 --> 05:22.900
A person, at least I do, I feel like each individual 
would like something of their own. They can say,

05:24.181 --> 05:27.685
mine. And I can say, mine, when I come in. Although I 
don't own everything.

05:40.597 --> 05:43.340
I tell a lot of the students, you're not an Aggie. 
What you mean? So you just attended school here. I

05:48.750 --> 05:49.772
said, I'm an Aggie. I'm a born Aggie. But you ain't. 
And I explained it to her. Don't believe me. You

05:57.863 --> 05:59.706
were going to Kyle Field. I don't believe you. But 
you know what I mean, until I really get serious.

06:06.816 --> 06:13.887
Now, back to this town, Richardson, probably, 
down there, Washington Chapel. I begged. I said,

06:15.129 --> 06:16.110
please don't. He sold that land $200 an acre. He 
could have got $200 a foot

06:19.970 --> 06:26.516
for it. Oh, boy. If you don't know, you don't know. 
That's big money. That's right.

06:40.429 --> 06:45.253
It wasn't to me.

06:46.094 --> 06:55.643
and you see something around the people, and you 
see around people all

06:46.094 --> 06:55.643
the time. Also, when you were talking about 
Washington Chapel, you were saying an elementary

06:56.644 --> 07:04.351
school was there. One room. One room. And how many 
grades did that serve?

07:12.458 --> 07:13.519
I think about the seventh. Did you have to walk from 
A&M campus to there? Well, a lot of people probably

07:20.287 --> 07:23.051
think that's pretty far today.

07:30.062 --> 07:35.090
Did it meet all year long? No, no, no. I meant nine 
months. Did it meet all the nine months? Was it a

07:39.376 --> 07:41.499
county school then? It had to be, yes. I'm not quite 
sure. Even when the weather was bad, you had to walk

07:44.600 --> 07:47.685
it. And even if it was raining, you would just have 
to come wet. Is that right? Do you remember after

07:54.596 --> 08:07.315
Consolidated was built over here off the campus on 
the Hollick land, was there a black school that was

07:54.596 --> 08:07.315
also developed around there for the black 
children to go to? Sure, that I know of. See, that

08:08.177 --> 08:09.038
was developed. On the harlot land, I wasn't there. 
I was there when I was. I see. So you don't know. I

08:17.203 --> 08:19.185
really couldn't tell. And you've heard of Lincoln 
Center and Lincoln School? I knew all the harlots,

08:22.429 --> 08:25.914
the old ladies. I knew all of them, the mama and the 
papa. I knew all of them.

08:34.284 --> 08:38.670
Well, can you tell me a little bit about that, the 
bohemian, bohemian? Community? Yes, they're

08:40.802 --> 08:44.125
very liberal people. You don't lie to them, you get 
along with them. Tell them the truth, it's OK.

08:47.209 --> 08:56.378
Kopchinsky, right up there by the tower, he used to 
own that. I'd sit down at his table so many times

08:56.398 --> 09:02.425
with him and his family. I knew him before. He sat in 
the chair. do him before he married. He was mother

09:10.649 --> 09:13.812
and father. They called him Mo-pop, or Mo-cop, and 
Po-cop. That's cute.

09:23.563 --> 09:28.249
And John Stastny down the lower, on the same side.

09:31.813 --> 09:36.518
Victor Bariski on the other side had a chicken 
farm. The Krennicks. Were you familiar with the

09:41.060 --> 09:42.362
Krennicks? The Krennicks. The Riskies. The 
Riskies.

09:51.871 --> 09:53.452
Nice people. How did you meet these people? 
They... Well, just... Because they farmed,

09:55.334 --> 10:01.800
didn't they? They didn't come... Excuse me. Did 
they come to A&M campus? Well, not really. Well,

10:07.396 --> 10:15.624
Felix and I would work up there a week or two or 
something, you know, when he'd get caught up doing

10:07.396 --> 10:15.624
the construction work. He was raising his family. 
And Rick and I would work up there. The old man John

10:20.569 --> 10:23.091
Stassman never did work. Frank David Vaughan 
never did work, but he had 10 or 12 shotgun houses

10:23.932 --> 10:29.597
over there. He was running. And he would farm.

10:36.004 --> 10:36.424
And that was it. And what were the years of the 
shotgun houses? Do you remember? Around the 30s.

10:42.986 --> 10:44.247
He built them around the 30s? He built them 
himself. It was for black people? Yes.

10:53.577 --> 11:01.945
Some of these men would come and work on campus, but 
you must have gotten off of campus and associated

10:53.577 --> 11:01.945
with them also. Is that right? Yes, for sure. Just 
being friendly. That's where I met a lot of these

11:08.076 --> 11:12.562
people from the rural. I mean, when I mean rural, I 
say, well, from around Rome, Chapel Weldon, or

11:12.683 --> 11:19.613
Berkshire. Look, I know more people. I know more 
white people than every client. Because I'm on the

11:26.082 --> 11:29.327
campus. When I started working at Standard Oil, I 
wasn't around nothing but Caucasian people. I

11:36.496 --> 11:40.921
could shower in, Ali Khan, all that much. Jane 
Russell. I knew all of them personally. The

11:45.206 --> 11:45.927
Kennedys. Because of working with Standard Oil? 
Close to them. Talk with them just like I'm talking

11:51.613 --> 11:54.937
with you. Frank Sinatra. That's wonderful. 
That's great. Jim DiMaggio. That's great. And

12:02.036 --> 12:10.888
then there's brothers and sisters, father, 
mother.

12:10.948 --> 12:13.412
There's lots of different men in these. Is it? Very 
much.

12:17.898 --> 12:19.800
What was the character of the town? Apparently, it 
must have been very close-knit so that if you would

12:21.182 --> 12:28.312
go and eat with different families. Here? Uh-huh. 
Uh-huh. To carry yourself in a respectable way.

12:39.638 --> 12:43.502
And didn't get that bill. Or clean, was clean. And 
he was alone with that children.

12:54.254 --> 12:57.858
Fine.

12:57.878 --> 13:01.482
There's some, I won't name them. It's just out 
there. Some of them are from Florida. And if you

13:08.421 --> 13:16.470
work for them,

13:08.421 --> 13:16.470
come get your food out the back door you sit on the 
steps and eat. That's not right. I know their

13:21.556 --> 13:22.737
names. If I call their name, you probably know 
them. I love them, but how are you going to do that?

13:28.630 --> 13:30.592
No, that's probably not right. But for the most 
part, people were not like that. Can you take the

13:35.839 --> 13:37.040
Maslens?

13:40.284 --> 13:45.230
One hundred and seven.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.011
Mr. Lewis? One hundred

13:46.612 --> 13:52.119
and seven. Dr. Walden? One hundred and seven. 
He'll be in the kitchen. I understand. Don't get me

13:56.524 --> 13:57.085
wrong. Bolton, he lived

13:58.702 --> 14:05.652
in the kitchen. But he up there in the dining room, 
he lived out here. And Connors,

14:09.638 --> 14:16.888
same thing. Winklers, same thing. Bryson, same 
thing.

14:25.340 --> 14:25.941
Langford, McNeely, same thing. Todd.

14:32.975 --> 14:36.520
And just so many, I can't think of all of them. 
Marsteller, same thing. Quillens, same thing.

14:43.430 --> 14:50.621
Did Mr. Langford, he helped you provide financing 
for college. Did he do this for other people, too?

14:52.984 --> 14:54.747
Not that I know of. It was just that they knew you 
because you lived on campus. Were there other

15:04.373 --> 15:07.917
black children that grew up on campus with you? Oh, 
a gang of them.

15:14.364 --> 15:16.206
I just guess they took a liking to me. After he died, 
I never did go see her before she passed. Not that I

15:22.612 --> 15:26.016
didn't want to, but I had a reason. It didn't make 
sense for me to go there and break down.

15:34.782 --> 15:35.783
She's old. She would break down.

15:39.548 --> 15:40.089
I wanted to. When I ran into everybody, she would 
die. When she had passed, I cried. That's my

15:43.913 --> 15:44.514
mother. So apparently, Mr. Langford was a very 
wonderful person, very unique, very... He was a

15:53.085 --> 15:54.406
peach. He was a prince. Well, his language was a 
prince. Press? P-R-E-S? P-R-I-N-C-E. Oh, a

16:02.774 --> 16:04.956
prince. Oh, a prince.

16:08.621 --> 16:17.051
You know, that's important because he was the 
mayor for so long, and he had such an influence on

16:08.621 --> 16:17.051
how College Station came to be. So College Station 
was very lucky to have him as their mayor. J.K.

16:23.118 --> 16:24.780
Walker was another man. Walker? J.K. Walker, Knox 
Walker.

16:31.183 --> 16:31.763
Nice people. My mother worked raising these boys.

16:38.251 --> 16:41.475
She worked for them all the time. F.R. Bryson. New 
Bryson still lives. She raised these boys. And

16:48.843 --> 16:52.327
they have one child. Do you like the way that 
College Station has developed? I do. Very proud of

16:56.395 --> 16:58.278
it. Although I'm lost if I get up there. But I can get 
down walking and, you know, find my way. But in a

17:03.785 --> 17:08.632
car, one-way streets, you know, and all that, I 
guess I'll turn around. Do you think it's growing

17:09.594 --> 17:14.441
too fast, or do you feel like that's the best for it? 
I think it's the best. It's progress. Do you find

17:18.006 --> 17:23.213
that because it's gotten larger that you don't 
have that closeness between people? That

17:23.682 --> 17:25.805
apparently you did when you were growing up here? 
Oh, I don't know any of the people there now. Right.

17:32.192 --> 17:36.858
But now, I'll get on the telephone and call Mrs. 
Brass, Mrs. Walker. This is Jim.

17:42.525 --> 17:43.666
Oh, Jim, you know. They remember you. Sure they 
know me. My mother passed in the 70s. I came here. I

17:49.956 --> 17:51.098
called Mrs. Bryson. She came over to Brian's and 
brought me some food. Oh, that was nice. My mother.

17:58.287 --> 17:59.208
Was she buried here? Yes. In this cemetery? No, she 
was buried in that. Brian? Mm-hmm. She died March

18:05.537 --> 18:07.619
11, 1907. And I had to stay there three weeks. As 
long as I had ever stayed in there, I found out.

18:16.231 --> 18:22.039
After your mother, I guess she had lived in the 
shotgun houses, did she move to Bryan later on?

18:22.220 --> 18:24.062
Yes, and built a home and everything. And still 
work as a domestic, or did she? She used to come out

18:27.547 --> 18:36.060
here, buy a car, and work as a domestic.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.047
What was her name? Stella. Stella White? Roan. 
Roan? R-H-O-N-E. R-H-O-N-E.

18:45.138 --> 18:53.448
Ms. Bryson knows her. Ms. Walker knew her. And

18:57.413 --> 19:05.243
I don't know if Ms. Wankler remembers her or not. I 
understand she's still alive. She's still

19:08.627 --> 19:10.229
someplace back over there. I think they told me 
where that someplace close to where Mr. Burgess

19:14.500 --> 19:20.086
used to live or live now. I know where that is, Lee 
Street. Lee Street is where Mr. Burgess lives.

19:30.958 --> 19:41.249
Do you remember the, apparently there was some 
kind of rural housing for boys that really didn't

19:30.958 --> 19:41.249
have the money and they came and it was kind of a 
co-op housing. Do you remember those? Since my

19:43.211 --> 19:44.372
time. Past your time? I mean, I went here. Right, 
right. But I think they were here. I don't know. I

19:52.489 --> 19:54.353
came here on a vacation. I saw. On University? I 
think so. I don't know what they were, but I think

20:00.445 --> 20:02.710
that's what it was. Was. I'm probably seeing.

20:11.538 --> 20:18.866
I probably am forgetting a lot of things, but is 
there anything that you would like to add that

20:11.538 --> 20:18.866
maybe I haven't talked about? Well, no, not in 
particular. And if you think of something else,

20:20.808 --> 20:26.014
well, you can get in touch with me. OK. My main point 
was just to know what College Station was like when

20:26.034 --> 20:35.765
you were growing up here, and what the character of 
the town was. It was very nice. I had more clothes

20:38.468 --> 20:40.330
then than I've gotten now. Because did you get them 
from kids living on campus? Students from school,

20:45.118 --> 20:46.339
yeah. They would give you their clothes? Oh, gee, 
money. Clothes.

20:55.770 --> 20:56.951
Nothing but clothes. Did they give them to other 
black children, too? Oh, yes. If they knew them,

21:00.595 --> 21:03.498
they'd let them in the dormitory.

21:06.942 --> 21:09.405
Shoes, shirts, socks, coats. Everything you can 
name. Not one thing, everything. I

21:15.411 --> 21:20.739
made out of 20, 21 seeds of clove. Did you take any of 
these and take them to your relatives in Navasota,

21:21.420 --> 21:27.769
like the food that we were talking about earlier? 
Well, I didn't have any relatives. I mean, my

21:30.893 --> 21:33.457
grandfather and things like that, you know. Or any 
of the other kids? I didn't, you know, other

21:35.900 --> 21:38.764
people. I couldn't eat all of it. So you also gave 
them away to people in the community. So it helped

21:44.425 --> 21:46.067
not only you, but others. That's great. Well, they 
didn't have the opportunity to go. To live on the

21:50.574 --> 21:51.515
campus. And get what I got. Well, you had such an 
interesting upbringing, being on the campus,

21:53.718 --> 22:03.212
being a part of everything, being part of the core 
activities. And you went to the football games.

22:06.637 --> 22:08.940
Never paid to go to a football game in life. But you 
went? Right. And what about baseball? Neither

22:12.232 --> 22:12.772
one. Did you go to them? Sure. Any time they had any 
kind of support? Dick Carr and all that group. I

22:17.938 --> 22:21.142
imagine they had any someplace. Knew them all. So 
for your recreation, you would go and watch the

22:22.223 --> 22:30.212
Aggies play sports. And for your own involvement, 
you and other blacks would play against, form your

22:30.232 --> 22:38.421
own teams? Were these kids that lived on the campus 
or kids you went to school with? Around the campus,

22:42.185 --> 22:48.714
you know, in walking distance, around hot liquor 
stores, places like that. Did you ever play

22:48.734 --> 22:50.076
basketball? I talked to Mr. Krennic, and he said 
he's older than you are, I believe. I'm not sure.

22:57.265 --> 23:00.069
But he said that they played basketball. Did you 
play basketball? I never played basketball. You

23:02.993 --> 23:04.976
didn't play basketball? I used to go up to the 
country club and carry. I liked golf. But

23:09.687 --> 23:11.909
basketball was all right. I really didn't like it, 
so I didn't play much other than baseball and

23:11.930 --> 23:17.115
football. I loved it.

23:22.962 --> 23:23.222
Okay. Well, is there anything else you'd like to 
add? No, not in particular. Okay. Well, I

23:27.567 --> 23:31.632
appreciate you having this interview with me. It 
certainly helped me a lot in writing. I'm glad I'll

23:35.296 --> 23:37.298
be able to help you. And those pictures there, 
after you have them blowed up, you can mail them to

23:39.269 --> 23:45.563
me. Okay. I'll mail these, and I'll mail a blown-up 
picture, too. All right. Thank you. Okay. Thank

23:53.259 --> 23:53.900
you very much. Let me turn this off.
