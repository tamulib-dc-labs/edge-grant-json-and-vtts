WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:06.018
students doing partying and what were they 
smoking and drinking? Well, a lot of the students

00:06.859 --> 00:16.593
smoked and a lot of them drank and often we would 
attend parties where there would be a lot of beer or

00:06.859 --> 00:16.593
it seems to me I don't drink. I mean, I didn't drink 
then. I seldom drink now and I don't like beer at

00:18.817 --> 00:23.684
all. So, it seems to me that most of them drank beer. 
I know my husband drank beer and had nearly had a

00:26.448 --> 00:32.316
real serious accident out on that bridge, going 
the wrong way on the bridge that didn't exist out

00:32.633 --> 00:39.123
there over the river. And margaritas, I think, 
they drank margaritas. And at some of the parties

00:45.913 --> 00:50.019
we would have, we'd have cookouts sometimes. That 
was the only time that we would entertain each

00:50.039 --> 01:02.337
other and have food other than just desserts was 
hamburgers and hot dogs because that was less

00:50.039 --> 01:02.337
expensive.

01:02.452 --> 01:04.535
You said smoking, but they were smoking what? Just 
regular tobacco. Just regular tobacco. But a lot

01:10.225 --> 01:11.286
of them did. But then I knew a lot of people that 
didn't smoke and all. We had friends who lived in, I

01:17.296 --> 01:24.848
don't even know whether they do this anymore, but 
there were a lot of garage apartments around town.

01:25.317 --> 01:30.222
You know, you have to find the, you know, okay, 
there's the garage upstairs and there's the

01:25.317 --> 01:30.222
apartment. And we had a lot of friends that lived in 
those kind of situations because people had

01:30.983 --> 01:40.353
realized that there weren't enough places for 
young couples. Now, as a veterinary student wife,

01:41.214 --> 01:49.022
you all didn't go to any of the big dances that year, 
did you? Not that year, but I had gone to, I dated my

01:51.878 --> 02:01.171
husband for two years before, and I was here for the 
senior ring dance when he was a junior. Describe

02:01.551 --> 02:03.934
going to the senior ring dance. Well, he was an 
officer that year, and the dance was held, I

02:05.416 --> 02:15.490
believe, in Sabisa Hall, and so it was a much, much 
smaller group of people who were attending it. It

02:15.706 --> 02:16.788
was very formal. What did you wear? I wore a long 
dress. It was a silk,

02:21.855 --> 02:29.947
not brocade, I believe it was a silk, well it was 
silk anyway. And it was,

02:30.528 --> 02:38.760
you know, he was dressed up in his uniform. And I 
believe I even had a tiara on that year. I think if I

02:42.573 --> 02:45.457
look at the picture, I might be able to see it. And 
white gloves, you know, the girls with the white

02:46.117 --> 02:50.683
gloves. And we would have a meal. We had our meal 
first in the dining hall. And we had a program with a

02:56.269 --> 03:00.394
tassel and very formal. and then they had the dance 
right there in Sivisa. And the orchestra was

03:05.921 --> 03:08.785
playing big band music? Pretty much so, but we're 
beginning to do, not the Beatles yet, I mean

03:09.146 --> 03:23.007
although that was the year that the Beatles were 
becoming very popular, but rock and roll was also

03:09.146 --> 03:23.007
very popular. was very popular, but it was a lot of 
big band, but some rock and roll, you know. I know

03:32.881 --> 03:44.576
that my husband had to disappear because he had to 
do some kind of business for the class, for his

03:32.881 --> 03:44.576
class, and so I was there for a while, for a few 
minutes by myself. But it was interesting. I also

03:46.157 --> 03:52.285
went to dances that they had at the football games 
in Dallas and in Fort Worth. because very often the

03:52.568 --> 04:04.051
outfits would have parties and you would, the 
previous members of the outfit would also attend

03:52.568 --> 04:04.051
those, so it was a kind of mixed crowd. And how were 
you young ladies treated to those dances? Very, I

04:08.110 --> 04:12.296
mean, I never had any problem with any time the way I 
was. I've never had anything but, like most of the

04:12.316 --> 04:16.221
guys you say, we treated them like queens. Right. I 
mean, you know, we were honored guests. And the

04:19.425 --> 04:24.552
only thing, I mean, there were occasionally, 
there were some guys that drank too much. But

04:24.572 --> 04:27.917
generally nothing else happened other than that. 
And some guys trying to get home to places where

04:27.977 --> 04:33.865
they weren't familiar with it. you know, five of 
them were staying in one of their buddies' house in

04:34.199 --> 04:50.644
Dallas or in Fort Worth and, you know, they might 
have gotten lost or they might, I know there was one

04:34.199 --> 04:50.644
time when a couple of them ended up sleeping 
outside in the car because they, once they got

04:34.199 --> 04:50.644
home, it was a good thing they got home, but they 
couldn't get in, so. But we, but those were, those

04:51.625 --> 04:56.292
were interesting parties and they were usually 
very formal also. I mean, not that we necessarily

04:56.312 --> 05:03.463
wore long dresses, but we did dress up for those, 
for those parties and, And I don't remember ever

05:03.832 --> 05:10.938
going to one in Houston, but I do remember going to 
one in Dallas, and I believe one in Fort Worth. Now,

05:11.939 --> 05:18.565
in the 60s, drugs were not even, the words weren't 
even known, were they? No, we didn't know anything

05:18.905 --> 05:32.117
about drugs, and the campus was very 
conservative, so I don't think that even though

05:18.905 --> 05:32.117
that was the beginning of the change, and I don't 
think that anybody here would have even thought

05:18.905 --> 05:32.117
about that. In the 60s, did you and your husband 
even know about the business establishments that

05:32.317 --> 05:39.793
supposedly existed over in LaGrange? I think we 
probably had heard about that, but not... Do you

05:42.098 --> 05:49.735
remember hearing Aggies ever talk about going 
over there? I didn't hear anybody specifically

05:49.883 --> 05:52.867
talk about that. I never did either. That's right. 
Because now the legend is growing. Although

05:57.292 --> 06:03.680
you're going to interview my friend and he can tell 
you about that because I believe he went. Okay.

06:06.003 --> 06:06.364
Let's see. We did racial integration and da, da, 
da, da, da. And I presume there was no one that you

06:09.948 --> 06:18.705
and other co-eds knew was a special person to y'all 
to turn to for advice? No, and that was, and looking

06:18.865 --> 06:32.412
back, I mean I don't know how many of the other 
co-eds were like me who were transient and who were

06:18.865 --> 06:32.412
going to be here only a year or two because they 
married somebody who was already a student here

06:32.712 --> 06:40.103
and we're going to leave but they had not made those 
kind of arrangements for us. I assume that within a

06:40.885 --> 06:54.906
couple of years that they did do that but they just 
didn't and when I say they the administration was

06:40.885 --> 06:54.906
in such a hurry I believe to go ahead and implement 
what they decided that they needed to do it. And

07:00.880 --> 07:07.728
even if there were things that got left out, that 
that was better than not and putting it off.

07:07.808 --> 07:13.414
Because once they did it, I mean, I guess it would be 
possible to go backwards. But if they had said, OK,

07:14.055 --> 07:23.526
we're going to do it in two years, and we're going to 
make all these arrangements beforehand, I think

07:14.055 --> 07:23.526
there could have been things And I think that, I 
mean, you probably know this better than I would,

07:23.675 --> 07:35.849
but I would guess that they wanted to do it as 
quickly as possible so that it couldn't be undone.

07:40.074 --> 07:47.623
Who were the other, as far as you know in that time, 
who were the other people that really made a

07:40.074 --> 07:47.623
difference on this campus? Well, we talked about 
Pinky Downs, and he was the spirit raiser. And I

07:52.016 --> 08:02.552
can't think of another specific person, but I know 
that just as now, the yell leaders were very, very

07:52.016 --> 08:02.552
important. To the boys that were in the Corps, all 
their outfit leaders were important. I don't

08:14.148 --> 08:23.160
remember talking to any other person that was 
important to me or that I knew of as far as

08:14.148 --> 08:23.160
administrators. I personally knew that, even 
though I didn't know him, but that Earl Rudder had

08:23.700 --> 08:35.035
made a difference in my life because I was able to 
come here because of that. And I did know a few of the

08:35.596 --> 08:40.442
people in the vet school at that time. All right, 
any other things in your list? I think I've covered

08:43.265 --> 08:50.676
just about everything else that I had talked about 
because we've gone over the things that I thought

08:43.265 --> 08:50.676
were so important. Silver taps and the muster were 
very important, and I participated in those since

08:51.057 --> 08:58.128
then. I think the Former Students Association 
became

08:58.148 --> 09:08.083
important to almost every Aggie also and because 
you wanted to be a member of the former students

09:08.401 --> 09:27.793
association what creates this aggie spirit aggie 
pride originally

09:08.401 --> 09:27.793
i think part of it was because you're different and 
when you're different that forces you even if you

09:08.401 --> 09:27.793
are have differences among yourself that forces 
you to be one unit. And now I think a lot of it has to do

09:33.750 --> 09:40.759
with the traditions and the history of A&M. Which 
traditions do you think are the most important?

09:43.362 --> 09:46.605
Well, I think muster and silver taps are very 
important. I think that there are some things that

09:47.346 --> 09:55.536
I think that we need to perhaps look at I think 
everybody's looking at him now. If being in the

09:59.011 --> 10:20.755
Corps is causing a student to not be able to succeed 
academically, then I don't think that the Corps

09:59.011 --> 10:20.755
should be, that they should do away with the Corps, 
but the Corps needs to facilitate the academics,

09:59.011 --> 10:20.755
because the students overwhelmingly are here for 
an education. I mean, I don't have anything, I

10:20.775 --> 10:25.320
think, like those two are the most important. I 
think participating in football games is

10:29.325 --> 10:33.269
important. And even as a graduate student and as a 
much older graduate student, I went to football

10:33.409 --> 10:38.633
games and I stood. And I always said that I wouldn't 
stand in the rain, but I did, you know, if it was 85

10:38.653 --> 10:49.182
degrees or 90 degrees, I did that. So all those kind 
of things are very important, but I think the

10:49.282 --> 10:55.628
things that make us different are muster and 
silver towels. What did you learn at A&M that's

10:56.080 --> 11:00.484
been important in your life? Did it have any effect 
on you, the fact that you had some years here? I

11:04.428 --> 11:22.304
think that being perhaps being part of an 
institution that is different made me cherish the

11:04.428 --> 11:22.304
differences and respect those differences in 
every way, in every person. And I think that that's

11:23.065 --> 11:25.227
one of the things. And it made me proud to be an 
Aggie, and I always wanted to be considered an

11:25.460 --> 11:31.951
Aggie. Even though at this point I don't have a 
degree from A&M, I always consider myself an

11:32.491 --> 11:37.419
Aggie.

11:40.164 --> 11:43.830
Should female Aggies have a different title? No. I 
think that even to consider it, I realize that In 64

11:49.793 --> 11:56.000
they really didn't know what to do, but there's no 
difference and we're Aggies. If you were a

11:57.541 --> 12:07.272
consultant to A&M today, what advice would you 
give them regarding the path to future even

11:57.541 --> 12:07.272
greater success? I think we have to respect 
everybody's differences. Although we are proud

12:12.458 --> 12:16.442
of our traditions and our history, and we don't 
want this not to be Texas A&M. I think that we have to

12:20.787 --> 12:46.362
realize that this is not the same school it was in 
1964 or in 1930 and that we have graduate students

12:20.787 --> 12:46.362
and that our emphasis in some ways has broadened, 
not necessarily changed, but we have broadened

12:20.787 --> 12:46.362
ourselves and that we have to emphasize that 
diversity makes us stronger. Do you have any, my

12:48.755 --> 12:58.063
question, if you could make a major gift to A&M, for 
what purpose would you want that gift used? Do you

12:58.444 --> 13:03.608
have any special interest areas of A&M? I think 
that I realized that at one time the library was

13:05.230 --> 13:12.737
very lacking. I must admit that at this point I 
think that Dean Heath's done a marvelous job over

13:12.917 --> 13:18.762
the 10 years or however long he's been here, 
because I know what it was like before he came. And

13:24.065 --> 13:29.710
I've always encouraged people to make donations 
to the library. The other thing that I, the other

13:30.111 --> 13:49.069
area that I think is important is, not necessarily 
because we're going down this road to a school of

13:30.111 --> 13:49.069
art, but I think that it's important to know that we 
do have some fine pieces of art on the campus and to

13:30.111 --> 13:49.069
promote that. Are there any people connected to 
this institution to whom you feel particularly

13:50.855 --> 13:56.622
grateful? Well, I've already said that I think 
that Earl Rudder changed my life and because I

13:57.623 --> 14:07.195
would have lived a different life if it hadn't been 
for him. Other than that, I'm not sure. I've been

14:09.317 --> 14:13.302
mentored recently by some of the administrators. 
I've had some wonderful relationships. Dean

14:16.706 --> 14:20.170
Stout is a friend. has always had time to listen to 
me. So there are some other administrators that I

14:24.429 --> 14:32.998
think that I stopped and spoke with Bill Perry last 
week. Good God. And I made a suggestion, and he

14:33.819 --> 14:37.523
said, well, why don't you take care of it? I think 
that one of the things that needs to be done is that

14:37.643 --> 14:46.512
the iconography of some of the buildings needs to 
be researched. And he said, why don't you talk to

14:46.846 --> 14:51.370
Dr. Woodcock about that? And unfortunately, his 
project is not going to do that. But we have some

14:54.473 --> 15:04.423
beautiful buildings with some very unusual 
artwork and I think that it needs to be explained

14:54.473 --> 15:04.423
and we need to know why we have these things. Last 
things then. What feelings do you hold in your

15:07.466 --> 15:09.688
heart for A&M? I wanted to come back here. I chose to 
come back to A&M in 1995. And I think that it's a

15:17.272 --> 15:23.683
wonderful place to live and I'd be happy to stay 
here even after I graduate. So I think A&M is a

15:24.905 --> 15:26.708
special place. I recognize that it's not perfect, 
but there's not any place that's perfect and I do

15:27.048 --> 15:34.440
like A&M and College Station. And you have to see 
its strengths and realize, you know, fight to

15:34.841 --> 15:42.233
change what needs to be changed.
