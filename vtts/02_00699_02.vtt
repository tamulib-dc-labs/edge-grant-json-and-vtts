00:03.693 --> 00:13.105
Professor Katz, tell us about how the entry of 
women affected

00:03.693 --> 00:13.105
Texas A&M women's students. Well, I think that had 
considerable, that happened, that came about

00:13.125 --> 00:25.841
much more smoothly than the matter of dropping the 
core as a requirement. When the girls first came

00:25.861 --> 00:33.210
in, why they came in is they had to be the wife of a GI,

00:35.570 --> 00:47.381
or the wife of any student, of course, or they'd be 
in the family of some professor or employee of the

00:35.570 --> 00:47.381
state. And then it got to where they... I think they 
actually had a lawsuit that never came to trial,

00:51.685 --> 01:02.995
but

00:51.685 --> 01:02.995
if it was good for... If it was good for this young 
lady because of her circumstance of being born in

01:03.329 --> 01:16.883
the right family or married to the right fellow, 
why, here's another one over here equally

01:03.329 --> 01:16.883
deserving, they think, and why couldn't she go? 
Why should she have to travel over to Sam Houston or

01:16.903 --> 01:20.867
some other place? So they put the heat on and 
brought the wide-open...

01:32.405 --> 01:35.049
admission of coeds. Did you have many female 
students in your engineering classes? A few, yes.

01:39.294 --> 01:44.281
How did their performance measure against their 
male counterparts? By and large, they were above

01:44.962 --> 01:47.105
average.

01:50.149 --> 01:55.476
Like spatial abilities supposedly attributed to 
females didn't enter in? In my opinion, the bulk of

01:55.692 --> 02:05.587
them wouldn't undertake engineering unless they 
had excelled in their high school work. They were

02:06.187 --> 02:13.719
above average students or they would not have 
tackled engineering. And they were still above

02:13.739 --> 02:19.006
average students.

02:19.387 --> 02:24.214
I

02:19.387 --> 02:24.214
had a few. What do you think was the reason for such 
small numbers of black students enrolled in

02:24.599 --> 02:30.407
engineering? Well, it's preparation. 
Preparation. One, they would get in and a lot more

02:36.815 --> 02:46.708
started than stayed.

02:47.296 --> 02:56.249
By and large, they would avoid engineering 
because the propaganda was that this is a real

02:47.296 --> 02:56.249
difficult course. You've got to have 
mathematics, you've got to do this, you've got to

02:57.191 --> 03:02.098
do that. You've got to speak thermodynamics

03:03.360 --> 03:11.312
in order to succeed in engineering. And they would 
take the path of least resistance, either go to

03:11.545 --> 03:19.991
prayer with you or go to work. And a little later on, 
they'd get in the Army. You mentioned that while

03:26.395 --> 03:34.346
you were at A&M from 58 to 76, most of your time was 
put into heavy teaching loads rather than the

03:26.395 --> 03:34.346
research. Do you think that the trend has changed 
too much as for professors to spend more time on

03:34.366 --> 03:39.754
research than they do on teaching? Yes. Do you 
think that can be detrimental to a university?

03:49.468 --> 03:50.629
That's a moot question. Research works. if 
associated with teaching, can very much improve

03:55.555 --> 04:00.760
teaching. For instance, my teaching down at Kelly 
Air Force Base, I was teaching...

04:10.549 --> 04:15.854
I was teaching metallurgy here, and I was teaching 
metallurgy down there. Well, the people I was

04:16.094 --> 04:23.841
teaching down there were the people that were 
actually doing the metallurgical work, working

04:16.094 --> 04:23.841
in the metallurgical laboratory And when they had 
failures on aircraft, they would bring the parts

04:24.395 --> 04:32.161
in there to be examined. Why did this fail? And then 
I was giving them a general background so that they

04:35.084 --> 04:47.694
would know not only how something failed, but why. 
Why the material was treated as it was and how it

04:49.496 --> 04:54.300
might have been otherwise. heat-treated or 
alloyed or whatnot. And the association I had

04:59.874 --> 05:08.024
there very much enriched the classes that I taught 
here, because I had examples. I would bring pieces

05:09.365 --> 05:14.331
and parts up there and show them, and you get the 
attention when you do that.

05:17.415 --> 05:19.157
It's not just something out of the book. What 
about, can some research though be detrimental as

05:21.280 --> 05:26.486
far as teaching goes? If a fellow gets himself in a 
bind in research, most all of that has got to, they

05:26.506 --> 05:48.250
have to make proposals, and they have deadlines on 
getting those proposals in, and they have to work,

05:26.506 --> 05:48.250
work, work day and night to make the goals on 
getting the proposals in. And when they're

05:49.208 --> 05:56.938
working 15 hours a day on that, they're not going to 
work too much on their teaching. They're going to

05:56.958 --> 05:59.061
get by as best they can. And the same thing's true 
when they start making their reports and

06:00.603 --> 06:18.287
getting... Or when the research work gets into a 
critical phase where they're getting such good

06:00.603 --> 06:18.287
results or bad results, as the case may be, 
because... Some research says they yield bad

06:18.740 --> 06:21.404
results. If it's going to be bad, well, you want to 
find out.

06:28.534 --> 06:38.288
But there are critical phases in that that make for 
neglect of the teaching work. Another thing is

06:38.308 --> 06:45.979
that they put a fellow in and say he's half-time 
teaching and he's half-time research. And it

06:47.309 --> 06:54.303
turns out both of them are about a three-quarter 
time job.

06:54.323 --> 07:01.939
Because as a half-time researcher, he's got the 
same kind of reports that a full-time researcher

06:54.323 --> 07:01.939
has. He's got the same kind of proposals to write 
up. As a teacher, he's got the students coming in

07:07.323 --> 07:13.232
for contact, for help. He's got the same 
extracurricular things to look out for that a

07:13.252 --> 07:21.364
full-time teacher has. And it turns out that a half 
and half deal is about a three-quarter and

07:21.384 --> 07:30.377
three-quarter, and that turns out to be about a job 
and a half. And I stand to be corrected on that. I've

07:37.177 --> 07:43.346
done some research for it, by the

07:37.177 --> 07:43.346
way. As you end your teaching career at A&M, how do 
changes occur as far as job opportunities for

07:44.528 --> 07:55.205
graduates over the years? Oh, there's an ebb and 
flow. you spoke of that you graduated in 1970,

07:57.492 --> 08:07.546
there was a low in employment opportunities along 
about then. Well, by the time I retired, there was,

08:07.566 --> 08:22.226
all they had to do was have your name on a diploma, 
and it was a choice of jobs. And it's still that way,

08:22.246 --> 08:26.993
although I understand. A good engineering 
student has a typical four, five, or six, or as many

08:27.310 --> 08:43.016
offers as he's able to interview and solicit.

08:45.240 --> 08:52.812
It is cyclical, and sometimes the need for more 
engineers and less engineers. Right now, the

08:54.841 --> 09:05.314
economic situation is such that these companies, 
they're still hiring, but they're cutting back on

08:54.841 --> 09:05.314
the numbers that they hire right now. And that may 
serve to throttle a number of people who take

09:06.475 --> 09:13.604
engineering. And eventually, when the economic 
situation comes into full bloom again, Then,

09:23.707 --> 09:30.755
there may not be as many engineers as there is 
opportunities to go to work. It cycles that way. I

09:35.219 --> 09:38.463
don't know what we can do about it. Russia hadn't 
figured out a good thing except to have too many

09:38.483 --> 09:42.968
engineers. Oh, Russia has too many? Oh, they have 
an enormous number of engineers.

09:49.998 --> 09:56.207
Japan, as little as it is, graduates more 
engineers, I think, than the United States does.

10:00.634 --> 10:06.783
And the bulk of these foreign students that come in 
here take engineering. Aren't they mainly

10:06.803 --> 10:11.009
subsidized by their governments, the ones that 
come in? Well, too many of them are subsidized by

10:11.029 --> 10:14.354
our government. How's that?

10:18.460 --> 10:19.161
Oh, one... one deal or another. See, after all, I 
worked on this Foreign Service thing for four

10:21.330 --> 10:35.087
years, and I was personally instrumental in 
sending a number of people over here for higher

10:21.330 --> 10:35.087
education, they called it. And the ones I sent over 
were under a contract they had to go back. But their

10:41.315 --> 10:49.485
way was paid over here by the American government 
under our foreign aid program.

10:51.845 --> 11:12.958
And a lot of those countries,

10:51.845 --> 11:12.958
although they pay the students way over here, 
they're getting foreign aid from the United

10:51.845 --> 11:12.958
States

10:51.845 --> 11:12.958
in a treasury to treasury situation. And part of 
the thing is that they send that people over here

11:13.411 --> 11:17.455
for education. What was your experience as an 
engineering faculty member regarding

11:17.475 --> 11:22.581
international students? Were they any different 
than regular American students? Well, of course,

11:27.666 --> 11:35.775
various ones of them have various language 
problems. And according to where they came from,

11:35.795 --> 11:41.781
they had The reality of engineering facts or 
equipment or machinery and all,

11:43.111 --> 11:57.371
they had not been exposed to it. It had been 
something that was academic.

12:02.973 --> 12:14.143
Getting them to put their hands on the stuff and 
really get with it was a little more difficult, but

12:02.973 --> 12:14.143
by and large, most of them who come are superior 
students. They've got a good mind.

12:18.486 --> 12:23.551
You get them to get their hands dirty or something 
else. Not

12:24.071 --> 12:31.798
really. Not really. I've had some of them try.

12:42.898 --> 12:46.762
And some of them may have gotten away with it more 
than I think they got away with.

12:50.846 --> 12:57.633
Do you ever see any of your farmers used to say, do 
you go somewhere, go to Houston or Dallas, do you

12:50.846 --> 12:57.633
ever run into them constantly? Some of them come 
here sometimes.

13:03.031 --> 13:06.356
I see my old students all the time. When I go to 
meetings like the American Society of

13:07.177 --> 13:20.016
Engineering Education or the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers, meetings like that, I

13:07.177 --> 13:20.016
always run into my old students. While you were at 
university, were you ever under any pressure to

13:22.420 --> 13:26.085
work on a doctorate? Yeah, well, yes.

13:31.911 --> 13:51.111
The reason I had to make a choice between accepting 
an associate professor promotion, which was

13:31.911 --> 13:51.111
timely and I thought deserved and they thought 
deserved and so forth, if I had accepted that, Then

13:53.116 --> 14:00.928
I would bar myself from getting a PhD at A&M.

14:00.988 --> 14:02.350
That restriction. Now, on that, I had some 24 hours 
to order a PhD or beyond a master's at that

14:02.370 --> 14:12.184
particular time. Also, that opportunity to go 
overseas occurred about that same time. And

14:22.327 --> 14:40.827
either I accepted those two things and got on with 
what I was doing, or I chucked the whole works there

14:22.327 --> 14:40.827
and refused the promotion and refused the 
overseas assignment and concentrated on the PhD.

14:44.831 --> 14:49.836
While you were there, was there a lot of pressure 
for faculty members to publish their findings?

14:50.795 --> 14:52.237
Oh, yes. But I got around that by actually doing it.

15:02.772 --> 15:10.023
You remember the book by Virgil Boring-Ferris 
called Thermodynamics? Or the one called FAIRES?

15:16.993 --> 15:18.996
Or the one in machine design? textbook by Ferris. 
He also wrote a book on mechanics.

15:27.801 --> 15:41.068
He was a very prolific writer and a prolific 
researcher at the library level and he I helped him

15:41.943 --> 15:51.772
revise a mechanics book, and I revised about 1,600 
problems in that book. I added new ones and so

15:52.052 --> 15:56.176
forth. So, the publication business I got around 
there. At least when I retired, when I got

16:01.882 --> 16:06.986
Professor Emeritus. When did A&M become a 
publisher-parish institution as it is today?

16:13.465 --> 16:26.640
Oh, I would say back through the 50s, 50s and 60s, 
the 60s more particularly.

16:26.660 --> 16:31.985
And you remember when you said you got out in 1970? 
And along then, why, there was a lull in

16:33.167 --> 16:41.616
opportunities to go into engineering or hiring 
The numbers being hired was much less and the

16:42.153 --> 16:48.099
salaries offered was much less. Along about that 
time, the academic institutions, A&M being one of

16:48.119 --> 17:10.962
them in particular here, they were able to go in and 
force their faculty to do writing do research and

17:11.887 --> 17:19.838
whatnot, because they had such a high and 
privileged job. And to hold that, they must excel.

17:23.002 --> 17:34.859
And that of excelling was they must get the name 
before the public and research and write.

17:34.879 --> 17:37.202
And the pressure came. The pressure on that came 
right along with it. Now, if you'll check up right

17:41.782 --> 17:55.641
now, there's been a lessening of that pressure 
because right now there's a scarcity of people in

17:41.782 --> 17:55.641
the engineering teaching profession. Scarcity 
in engineering, not in other fields. No. And with

18:00.047 --> 18:07.898
that scarcity, you won't hear the wheels squeak on 
that publish or perish There's

18:09.329 --> 18:39.167
some other area, Professor Katz, that you could 
elaborate on that might be of interest

18:09.329 --> 18:39.167
to this interview or

18:09.329 --> 18:39.167
this interview.

18:42.016 --> 18:59.020
Oh, I think that some of the young faculty we have 
now come to us with their PhDs, their expertise,

18:42.016 --> 18:59.020
their know-how in the use of certain experimental 
equipment. They come to us and one of the first

18:59.040 --> 19:10.116
things they must do is to carry on their research 
work and to carry on their research work they must

19:10.889 --> 19:14.833
have some of that particular experimental 
equipment. Most of it's expensive. Whereas, the

19:20.419 --> 19:34.615
equipment that's already on hand might be able to 
do the same job, but these young experts don't know

19:20.419 --> 19:34.615
how to use this other equipment. But they want 
something on which they are the expert. And that is

19:38.716 --> 19:53.354
an expensive proposition from the standpoint of 
money, the standpoint of building use, the

19:38.716 --> 19:53.354
standpoint of utilization of equipment that's 
already on hand. And those same people tend to have

19:53.474 --> 20:04.808
an inferiority that they hide.

20:05.294 --> 20:10.040
don't want to get into an area in which they are not 
expert. After all, they have a PhD. And they hate to

20:12.784 --> 20:15.868
admit they don't know something. So they go around 
trying to confine themselves to teaching a very

20:15.888 --> 20:34.052
few courses and using a relatively limited 
variety of equipment and doing a limited variety

20:15.888 --> 20:34.052
of research work. And they're unfairly limiting 
themselves because they're afraid somebody will

20:34.657 --> 20:44.327
say he doesn't know everything. An old-timer like 
me that taught 28 different courses in my time,

20:46.129 --> 21:03.246
when they needed a course taught, if I knew 
something at all about the field, I got with it and

20:46.129 --> 21:03.246
dug it out. I've taught some courses I never had. 
That's correct.

21:10.459 --> 21:12.584
That's correct. Has this made cost of engineering 
research much higher than it could be otherwise?

21:17.193 --> 21:23.766
And with the scarcity of faculty applications, 
why these applicants come in and they demand that

21:24.151 --> 21:32.122
they be permitted to do research in this 
particular field. They teach these particular

21:32.142 --> 21:34.425
courses. They must teach graduate courses. And 
most of them, a lot of those that are teaching a

21:39.011 --> 21:51.768
graduate course would fall on their face trying to 
teach the undergraduate course that backs up that

21:39.011 --> 21:51.768
graduate course. What do you mean by that? Well, 
the most difficult courses in engineering are not

21:55.184 --> 22:02.936
the graduate courses. They're the undergraduate 
courses that are the foundation, the

22:02.976 --> 22:09.807
fundamentals for those graduate courses. You 
mean it's possible to teach some of the more

22:10.207 --> 22:15.436
advanced courses without really knowing those 
fundamentals? Have them really taught those

22:15.456 --> 22:19.322
fundamentals. And when you have not taught a 
course, old father time comes in and takes away

22:22.775 --> 22:38.320
your expertise if you ever had any

22:22.775 --> 22:38.320
yeah

22:22.775 --> 22:38.320
i found that when you teach something you have to 
learn it

22:42.248 --> 22:57.566
What I had asked earlier regarding this type of 
attitude toward my faculty members, does this

22:42.248 --> 22:57.566
increase the cost of engineering research and 
what it would be otherwise, the requirement for

22:42.248 --> 22:57.566
special equipment and so forth? It increases the 
cost of teaching. It increases the cost of some of

22:59.549 --> 23:07.378
those faculty members, the younger faculty 
members are promoted. on the basis of their, well,

23:08.371 --> 23:13.396
on the basis of need, really. You need somebody, 
and you've got to have, you've got so many

23:14.737 --> 23:31.975
applicants, and they won't come unless he gets an 
associate or an assistant professorship, or some

23:14.737 --> 23:31.975
of them demand that if they've got a little 
experience, they may only come in as a full

23:14.737 --> 23:31.975
professor. And the only way you can get them is to do 
that. And those Those things are not in an orderly

23:39.252 --> 23:44.523
step-by-step process. Of course, on the other 
hand, you can go for years and years, and a fellow

23:44.723 --> 23:53.802
stay in grade and use him up. I probably had a life 
full of experience in that line. I taught courses

24:03.343 --> 24:16.858
that full professors taught, and I was an 
associate professor for a long time there until,

24:03.343 --> 24:16.858
of course, I retired as a professor emeritus. But 
the salary was kind of low in that job.

24:23.786 --> 24:24.447
All honors.

24:27.177 --> 24:52.088
well with all these changes then what you're 
implying or at least what i'm inferring is that the

24:27.177 --> 24:52.088
quality of the teaching has not changed in the last 
30 years only the research may have souped up the

24:27.177 --> 24:52.088
progress but this really hasn't been that much 
change in the quality of teaching is that true and

24:27.177 --> 24:52.088
you find another thing they when there's been so 
much stuff added in the last You're given any

24:53.587 --> 24:57.793
number of years you please to call out. Five years, 
10 years, or 50 years. We're doing things now. We

25:04.183 --> 25:15.900
have levels of technology, expertise in 
mathematics and computer work and so forth now

25:04.183 --> 25:15.900
that didn't exist then. Now, if they're going to 
teach about those things,

25:23.202 --> 25:24.444
What are they going to leave out?

25:29.751 --> 25:31.614
It accumulates like history.

25:36.060 --> 25:39.205
Something has to be left out.

25:41.248 --> 25:49.800
When I was a student, 1928 to 1932, we didn't have 
any jet engines. We didn't have any rocket

25:51.535 --> 25:54.379
engines. Only rockets and fireworks. We didn't 
have any radar. We didn't have any antibiotics. We

26:03.471 --> 26:06.375
didn't have any...

26:10.340 --> 26:17.029
When I get my mind to it, I can name about 10 
different major fields. There was no digital

26:17.109 --> 26:19.332
computer.

26:23.277 --> 26:27.042
The digital computer had just not been conceived 
at that time. And the slide rule didn't go out of

26:29.405 --> 26:36.155
style until a year, 10 years, 10, 15 years ago, 
about 10 years ago.

26:40.020 --> 26:47.310
And when you bring in the teaching of all of these 
new things, somehow you must. And now they're

26:49.535 --> 26:53.219
telling us they must get into the field of robots. 
And if you're going to teach all about robots, why,

26:54.961 --> 26:59.086
that's something extra. What are you going to 
leave out?

27:03.512 --> 27:07.276
A four-year college course is still a four-year 
college course. And I'll cite one more thing. When

27:08.938 --> 27:13.323
I was a student, we had 18-week semesters.

27:16.587 --> 27:17.348
Now... You don't have over about 15 weeks of actual 
classwork, and not even that in the fall semester.

27:31.314 --> 27:37.522
15 weeks of actual classwork.

27:37.602 --> 27:40.625
The time applied has decreased. The number of 
student credit hours that a student takes has

27:42.628 --> 27:46.693
decreased.

27:50.048 --> 27:57.577
And the number of weeks it takes has decreased, and 
at the same time, the amount of information that he

27:50.048 --> 27:57.577
needs to gather has exploded.

28:01.782 --> 28:18.823
Consequently, I'd say that when a fella gets his 
degree,

28:01.782 --> 28:18.823
nowadays, he's in a position to learn something 
about whatever work he goes into. So he won't know

28:19.630 --> 28:24.135
what you're buying. Looking back on your long 
teaching career, Professor Cassidy, have you

28:24.155 --> 28:31.123
ever regretted coming to A&M back in 1932? No, 
never. 28, rather? No, never. Never regretted it?

28:35.468 --> 28:39.612
You must not have got to go back to Mississippi too 
much back in the 30s. No, I didn't. My freshman

28:41.775 --> 28:45.739
year, I went back at the end of the whole year. Then 
on I went home on Christmas, but that's all.

28:52.526 --> 28:54.247
Hitchhiking back home? Yeah. Back then it was easy 
to hitchhike, compared to now. Yeah, it was. When

28:58.552 --> 29:00.594
did it become so difficult to hitchhike? Thugs. 
When? About what time?

29:06.620 --> 29:07.541
The 60s or 50s? I guess some of that coincides with 
all of the Berkeley activities. where they no

29:15.250 --> 29:30.573
longer, a student was no longer

29:15.250 --> 29:30.573
recognized as a person following an honorable, 
with honorable intentions.

29:30.593 --> 29:37.323
But back in my day, people picked you up, glad to 
pick you up if you have company on a long trip. No

29:39.586 --> 29:40.347
problem.

29:44.883 --> 30:02.790
Well, it

29:44.883 --> 30:02.790
may be about time

29:44.883 --> 30:02.790
for me to get back to my retirement. I didn't think 
of anything in particular. What were you doing in

30:08.281 --> 30:11.705
retirement, by the way? Were you doing anything in 
particular? Well, for about the first four years

30:13.326 --> 30:19.552
of that period, I did considerable consulting. I 
did some consulting long before I retired. I went

30:25.278 --> 30:29.322
to consulting about more so than the research 
route. I was working on real problems for real

30:31.044 --> 30:34.667
people, and not on something hypothetical.

30:45.931 --> 31:04.536
I could get all of the research work I could handle 
and would either go into it as a full business or

30:45.931 --> 31:04.536
when I found out that I would have to keep the same 
set of books as though I were General Motors or

30:45.931 --> 31:04.536
something, on withholding tax,

31:05.157 --> 31:17.395
the workman's compensation, social security 
deductions. He had to keep all of those books and

31:17.415 --> 31:19.678
all. If a fella doesn't have a pretty sizable staff 
the way he has a secretary who does the bulk of all of

31:20.079 --> 31:28.431
that filing work for him, You have to have a pretty 
big operation or else confine yourself to a

31:28.883 --> 31:38.415
strictly one-man operation. And I throttled back 
after that. And then, after so long a time, I had a

31:45.044 --> 31:50.752
heart attack and that throttled it back. I still do 
a little research. I mean, still a little

31:52.614 --> 31:55.718
consulting. When did you have your appointment? 
In September of 79.

32:06.863 --> 32:11.431
Looking back on it, not necessarily from an 
engineering standpoint.

32:13.796 --> 32:14.717
There was July.

32:17.542 --> 32:20.608
Looking back on your life, Professor Cassidy, 
Could you say, has there been any particular

32:21.230 --> 32:42.716
decade in which you've been alive that you thought 
was better than the other decades, not

32:21.230 --> 32:42.716
necessarily

32:21.230 --> 32:42.716
related to engineering? The 60s could have been. I 
think maybe the 50s were. You think the 50s were a

32:48.909 --> 32:55.699
better time to live in than

32:48.909 --> 32:55.699
the 80s? Well, now, in the 80s, right now, it all 
depends. The people that have jobs, that have a

33:00.646 --> 33:06.415
living, insurance somehow, they're doing fine. 
But the people that are unemployed, they're not

33:06.435 --> 33:10.120
doing so well. What do you think is the cause of the 
high rate of unemployment? Do you think there's

33:15.438 --> 33:20.004
any one single cause?

33:20.024 --> 33:34.385
We can't go along with an unbalanced budget year 
after year after year, getting worse and worse and

33:20.024 --> 33:34.385
more worse without the chips falling someplace. 
Furthermore, In our foreign trade, we have had a

33:37.387 --> 33:40.752
deficit. Foreign trade now, year after year after 
year, and when you buy more than you sell, foreign

33:40.892 --> 33:48.965
countries. I think that even includes the 
giveaways.

33:56.957 --> 34:05.470
You can't do that without some time or another, 
otherwise the chips are going to fall. and they're

34:06.614 --> 34:08.976
falling right now. Do you think there's any 
solution to the economic problem today? They've

34:16.665 --> 34:20.428
got to cut out all this throwing money. They've got 
a problem, what do they do? They throw money at it

34:22.911 --> 34:25.934
just like you're throwing baseball. Some people 
claim that too much has already been cut out of

34:26.775 --> 34:31.440
things and delivered today.

34:35.133 --> 34:45.430
I think some of those same people get out and go to 
work, why, that would help solve the problem too.

34:45.450 --> 34:50.938
I would like to see a little Americanism preached.

34:50.959 --> 35:00.253
I got a son, we got a son that has a Datsun pickup. I 
call that a Pearl Harbor pickup.

35:06.942 --> 35:25.333
Sometimes

35:06.942 --> 35:25.333
it's an illusion that the foreign product is 
better. Just wait until that day comes around when

35:25.354 --> 35:28.579
you need to repair it.

35:31.293 --> 35:49.707
sometimes that's a real illusion right i've heard 
some people say that i've heard others

35:31.293 --> 35:49.707
say that until

35:31.293 --> 35:49.707
we have a balance and what we take in and what we 
spend. The government's no different than what

35:53.640 --> 35:57.386
you are or what I am. Well, you think that President 
Reagan probably is on the right track. He's trying

36:01.913 --> 36:05.779
to be.

36:05.799 --> 36:12.149
He's never going to pull any Congress to deal with.

36:12.229 --> 36:14.513
Congress more nearly than the Senate.

36:24.280 --> 36:28.166
I'm a recipient of Social Security. But if they 
keep on increasing the Social Security with this

36:29.429 --> 36:41.749
so-called consumer price index route, it is going 
to exponentially

36:44.294 --> 36:46.916
It will go beyond all imagination. There's no way. 
I think that probably more than anything else,

36:47.717 --> 36:55.163
maybe the cost of living increases coming on that. 
Like you said, an exponential increase. I think

36:58.766 --> 37:01.048
it's nearly double what it was 10 years ago. The 
cost of living goes to all of the government

37:01.068 --> 37:06.673
employees. It goes to all

37:06.693 --> 37:13.879
of the

37:16.897 --> 37:17.999
It goes to all of us. It goes to all retirees

37:18.119 --> 37:23.646
in the military. It goes to all the active duty in 
the military. It goes to all of the bureaucrats.

37:30.716 --> 37:36.103
And one of the bureaucracies is the worst thing in 
the world that we've got. You get a little pimp

37:36.224 --> 37:41.571
going here, and it wants to enlarge itself, king 
the belly. Well, we've kind of gotten off the topic

37:42.749 --> 37:47.058
there quite a ways with engineering. Is there 
anything else you want to say before we close? No,

37:50.766 --> 37:59.425
but when you go to other institutions, you can come 
back and take pride in A&M is what it is.

38:07.454 --> 38:10.311
Thank you very much for spending the afternoon 
with us, Professor Cass. I enjoyed visiting with

38:10.331 --> 38:12.302
you. Appreciate your time.
