WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:06.549
be they performers or speakers or politicians who 
made appearances on campus? Well, as I was just

00:07.110 --> 00:13.899
talking about Town Hall, I remember that Ray 
Armstrong and his band came here. Ray Anthony. Ray

00:15.941 --> 00:21.549
Anthony, you're right, Ray Anthony. And a couple 
of singers, it seemed like one of them's name was

00:22.350 --> 00:27.377
Cummings. Charles Lawton came and had readings. 
Yeah. I remember that very well because it came

00:32.431 --> 00:37.256
time for the performance. Spike White, who was 
head of student activities, well, part of student

00:38.357 --> 00:50.228
activities and head of all that business, came 
around and told us, we've got a real problem.

00:50.248 --> 00:51.749
What's the problem? Mr. White said, well, Mr. 
Lawton says he's not going to perform tonight.

00:56.574 --> 00:59.957
We've got the whole down hall filled with people. 
Well, he's paid here to come. Well, he's not

01:05.271 --> 01:09.095
feeling too well. But they finally convinced him 
to go out about 30 minutes later, and he put on a

01:09.115 --> 01:15.221
magnificent performance. So that kind of thing 
sort of sticks in my mind. All right, the other

01:18.684 --> 01:25.451
thing, talking about who came, Rod Eisenhower 
came a couple times when I was here on the campus.

01:25.691 --> 01:31.497
One, well, mainly he came to inaugurate Dr. 
Harrington was president of the university.

01:36.411 --> 01:41.779
Guyon Hall, what role did it play as a facility in 
student life? Guyon Hall was an assembly hall at

01:41.799 --> 01:49.831
the end, at the south end of Middle Cary Walk, 
located about where Rudder Tower is now. And it was

01:51.313 --> 01:55.599
the place where we had various assemblies. When we 
had religious emphasis week, that's where those

01:55.639 --> 02:01.888
that wanted to go, that's where the speakers were. 
on cultural kind of things like I was just

02:02.797 --> 02:06.883
mentioning. That's where the performances were. 
It was the largest place on campus in the form of an

02:10.168 --> 02:16.998
auditorium kind of thing. And movies. That was 
used. And then, yeah, movies, you're right. On

02:22.186 --> 02:28.175
campus, the movies that were given on campus were 
shown in Grand Hall. Please describe Religious

02:28.576 --> 02:31.420
Emphasis Week as you remember it. Well, that was a 
week set aside. I remember particularly my senior

02:36.917 --> 02:44.866
year, the people that came, but we had three or four 
excellent speakers that came. One was a chaplain

02:44.886 --> 02:50.973
from Washington, D.C., one was a minister from 
Dallas, and several others. And they just, they

02:52.215 --> 02:57.441
would have main speeches, they would have a number 
of sort of workshops where we talked about various

02:58.298 --> 03:04.607
things, different topics. It was an affair that 
lasted a whole week. I thought it was an excellent

03:07.211 --> 03:13.561
program.

03:15.584 --> 03:17.927
G. Raleigh, was it built? G. Raleigh White? That's 
a blank in my memory. G. Raleigh White apparently

03:22.193 --> 03:25.318
was being built when I was here on the campus. 
Whether it opened by the time I left tonight, I

03:25.990 --> 03:29.294
don't really remember that at all. It's just 
blank. Where was commencement held? Where'd you

03:33.881 --> 03:35.903
graduate? I think we graduated from Kyle Peel.

03:40.710 --> 03:44.014
Do you, can you describe what commencement was? 
You know, I'm sort of blank on that. I remember a

03:49.361 --> 03:52.926
commission, we had a commission Ceremony in Gine 
Hall. In Gine. But I think we were too big for Gine,

03:56.160 --> 04:03.128
and I don't know necessarily, I'm blank on T. 
Raleigh White. We may have had the commencement in

04:03.148 --> 04:06.452
there, but it seemed like it was kind of people. Was 
the commissioning speaker some notable, famous

04:06.592 --> 04:10.576
person? I don't remember any. So it wasn't Dwight 
Eisenhower or somebody like that, you would. No.

04:15.982 --> 04:22.930
What were the major student activity groups, MSC 
Council and what else? Well, it was Corps of

04:23.618 --> 04:30.909
Cadets, which at that time still was the main 
organization here on the campus. It was the MSC

04:30.929 --> 04:33.693
Council. There were various clubs, hometown 
clubs. There were radio clubs, photography

04:37.518 --> 04:42.105
clubs, various things. What about singing 
cadets? There was singing cadets. There was a

04:46.511 --> 04:51.398
band, and like today, they've played for the games 
during the fall, but during the spring they sort of

04:51.800 --> 04:59.109
played a different kind of music.

05:04.055 --> 05:04.475
Where's that? I'm not asking now if you were a 
member. Were there, as far as you know, any secret

05:07.279 --> 05:11.924
fraternities then? There apparently were, 
because I remember my junior year, a number of

05:11.944 --> 05:20.895
cadets got in trouble for At least the authorities 
thought they belonged to the secret

05:22.377 --> 05:28.564
organization. And at that time, that was against 
the universal rules. What were the names or name of

05:32.848 --> 05:35.871
those? The only name I remember was called the TTs 
or the True Texans. And I've since heard about

05:41.998 --> 05:49.586
swastikas and stickers or whatever, but that may 
be all the same thing. I don't know. Let's see. And

05:52.904 --> 05:57.510
they, as far as you know, what was their purpose? I 
don't know. I don't really know. Let's see,

06:01.556 --> 06:04.880
project houses, were they still in use in those 
days? Those houses down at Southgate that had been

06:05.722 --> 06:19.941
built during the Depression for... No, at the 
Southgate, when I was a student here, what I

06:05.722 --> 06:19.941
remember is they were... They were married 
students' houses. A series of them all looked

06:22.179 --> 06:28.124
alike, and they were there until not too long ago. 
Now, what's just now been torn down the police

06:28.545 --> 06:37.193
station was originally a project house, but I 
don't remember what it was when I was here.

06:38.694 --> 06:39.115
Let's see. There were still some veterans here on 
the campus when you... There were a number of

06:45.421 --> 06:47.042
veterans, and... They didn't have to be in the 
Corps, but there were a number in my graduating

06:48.288 --> 06:55.335
petroleum engineering class. We had, I guess, 
eight or ten veterans. Did you all think of them as

06:59.700 --> 07:02.903
old students? I suppose we probably did early on, 
but once we got to know them and by the time we were in

07:04.004 --> 07:15.696
our fourth year of graduating, or fifth year, they 
were just part of the class. What role did

07:17.397 --> 07:25.064
international events play in your thoughts about 
life after graduation? In my own particular

07:26.345 --> 07:28.467
thoughts, very little. I don't remember too much 
about it. The international events that were

07:33.051 --> 07:37.275
impacting, I guess, were like the Korean War. I 
joined the National Guard when I was in high

07:38.036 --> 07:42.380
school. And after my freshman year here, summer of 
1950 we were at summer camp and we thought we were

07:47.418 --> 08:14.657
going to never come home from summer camp but that 
didn't turn out that way but that would be the

07:47.418 --> 08:14.657
international kind of event and then as I went into 
the when I got an advanced contract in the Air Force

07:47.418 --> 08:14.657
I had to drop out of the National Guard because I was 
in the Army at that time but you know we thought

07:47.418 --> 08:14.657
about in terms of conflicts overseas and that kind 
of thing that's where we might go as far as going

08:15.582 --> 08:21.890
into business, so I didn't give it much thought. 
Did A&M help you with summer jobs?

08:27.718 --> 08:28.900
The A&M did one year. See, I guess that

08:28.920 --> 08:36.230
was after my freshman year. Again, I went to . My dad 
had died, and my mother had moved to Austin. And I

08:43.460 --> 08:45.302
didn't know anybody in Austin, be home for the 
summer and work. I had to work. So I went to Mr.

08:49.019 --> 09:01.056
McQuillan again and asked him if he thought that 
Mr. Wynne could help me get a job in Austin.

09:02.859 --> 09:04.121
And should I write him? He said, well, let me just 
take care of that for you. And it turned out that

09:07.606 --> 09:09.588
that's what happened. He cut word back to go see a 
couple of people in Austin. went out and put me to

09:15.083 --> 09:22.171
work with a moving company, working all summer, 
which is great. Now, what routine did you and other

09:22.191 --> 09:28.758
students have for going home or other places on 
weekends when you didn't have a car? We had a great

09:29.699 --> 09:38.409
hitchhiking system that had developed over the 
years at A&M, and we used it extensively if you

09:29.699 --> 09:38.409
wanted to go anywhere. I wanted to go anywhere at 
least for the first two or three years because I

09:39.270 --> 09:42.494
didn't have a car. I didn't know anybody with a car. 
and the system was most anywhere you went there was

09:44.851 --> 10:12.310
a certain spot that had been selected and like out 
at the annex you'd go out to the main gate on highway

09:44.851 --> 10:12.310
21 and if you if you were heading west you were okay 
because if you were you got a ride you could keep

09:44.851 --> 10:12.310
that ride but if you're going east you had to 
hitchhike in the brown and then in the direction

09:44.851 --> 10:12.310
from there you had to go the aggie hitchhiking 
place And where was that in Bryan? I don't remember

10:14.042 --> 10:15.784
exactly where it was. I never really early on went 
that direction, but it must have been about where

10:15.904 --> 10:30.480
Highway 21 and Highway 6 cross, not the new bypass, 
but the old Highway 6. Once you got to the camp? Once

10:32.322 --> 10:36.587
you got to that hitchhiking place, then there was a 
protocol that you went through. In the first

10:36.607 --> 10:40.491
place, you knew you were going to be at the end of the 
line because that was in the album. But you went up

10:41.213 --> 10:46.518
to the man that was first in line, and you met 
everybody all the way down the line. And then you

10:46.538 --> 10:47.579
took your place. But it didn't go by classes. It 
went by who got there, first come, first serve kind

10:50.162 --> 10:55.327
of thing. And if you were in line and four seniors 
came up behind you, that was OK. They wouldn't go to

10:59.911 --> 11:01.093
bunk you out of line. Where, from the main campus, 
where was that hitchhiking location? Out of what

11:05.817 --> 11:10.562
we called the East Gate. On that time, Highway 6, 
the bypass wasn't here, so we went out to the main

11:10.897 --> 11:19.871
gate and drove south and north. That's where we 
were going. What did you wear and what gear did you

11:22.595 --> 11:26.662
take with you hitchhiking? Well, the best thing to 
wear if you were hitchhiking was a uniform,

11:26.682 --> 11:34.694
because people anywhere, if they saw an Aggie 
standing on the road hitchhiking, they'd pick him

11:26.682 --> 11:34.694
up. And usually, I took very little gear. I had a 
little shaving kit, a toothbrush, and cestas in

11:38.504 --> 11:47.435
there, and maybe a little small bag with a change of 
clothes. That was about it. Let's see, how did an

11:51.661 --> 11:53.743
Aggie get a date? Get her to and from the campus and 
so forth? Sometimes wonder about that. The way you

12:02.274 --> 12:07.060
got dates, well, obviously people that you knew, 
mainly to meet other girls and so on through

12:08.255 --> 12:11.520
friends. We were going to another town like my 
freshman year. I didn't have a roommate in the

12:16.427 --> 12:21.494
barracks because there were 20 of us, I think, in 
one barracks, but we had bunkmates. We had

12:21.634 --> 12:33.691
double-decker bunks and so my bunkmate was a 
fellow from Waco and when we went on a court trip to

12:21.634 --> 12:33.691
Waco, obviously he got me and several other people 
mates with friends of his. So that was the main way

12:33.711 --> 12:36.355
we met people. If girls were coming to the campus, 
they would either come by bus or train. They were

12:44.556 --> 12:47.260
coming from a distance, or some of them, if they had 
friends. A lot of them, like, if they were coming

12:47.280 --> 12:54.913
from Austin, would more than likely come with 
friends that had college. So it was a little

12:54.993 --> 12:58.739
difficult to get Austin over here by bus. Where did 
they stay here? They stayed all over the place.

13:02.963 --> 13:06.870
with faculty members, with anybody that you knew 
that you could get a room. A lot of people would rent

13:06.910 --> 13:08.973
rooms on weekends. Did you ever hear of moose pots 
and beast buckets? No, I don't think so. Those

13:17.527 --> 13:18.890
terms would be used later. You and your buddies 
would have blind dates with a group of girls. Yeah,

13:22.716 --> 13:24.118
okay. And there would be a pot here as to which one 
got stuck with the worst one. They, meanwhile,

13:28.145 --> 13:29.207
would have and I'd forgotten which was male and 
which was female, and each group thought they were

13:29.508 --> 13:35.095
the only ones worried about getting stuck. I don't 
remember those particular terms, but there were

13:35.496 --> 13:39.761
other terms. Now, on a Saturday night, if an Aggie 
had a date, where would he take her? To what kind of

13:45.429 --> 13:49.394
place or event? Normally, the reason you'd bring a 
date here to the campus was because there was a

13:49.414 --> 13:59.447
dance or something like that that you were 
bringing her here for. other than that people

14:00.119 --> 14:05.867
would go to their hometown or wherever the date was 
and have a date there. Please describe one of those

14:05.887 --> 14:07.530
dances. Well the one I remember the most I guess was 
military ball my senior year and that was military

14:09.713 --> 14:25.095
weekend so there were a number of distinguished 
people here on the campus. The ranking officer

14:25.155 --> 14:28.860
that came down was General McCullough famous in 
World War II, Battle of the Bulge time, for saying

14:29.195 --> 14:36.145
nuts to the Germans. But they were, I remember 
going out to Eastwood when they came flying in on a

14:36.165 --> 14:52.349
converted B-17 that had been made to a transport, 
and they must have been about 20 people or so that

14:36.165 --> 14:52.349
came in. So that was, the ball was just part of the 
overall weekend, where we had a lunch and a parade

14:52.369 --> 14:58.678
and The combat ball had been the night before. So it 
was a big weekend. So where was that dance held? The

15:05.947 --> 15:13.858
dance, like normal, was held in Sevesa where they 
would clear out all the tables and everything and

15:05.947 --> 15:13.858
have a big floor for dancing. And what did people 
wear? The cadets would wear their uniforms and the

15:17.743 --> 15:27.196
girls usually had on their evening gowns and the 
finery that they had brought with them. Big bands?

15:28.493 --> 15:33.079
We had, for that military ball, I'm sure it was the 
Aggieland orchestra that played. I'm not

15:33.099 --> 15:34.421
absolutely sure of that. But there was an 
orchestra, which we didn't mention

15:34.441 --> 15:39.968
earlier. Describe the community of College 
Station that surrounded the campus. What was

15:47.137 --> 15:48.779
here, and where was it? There wasn't a whole lot 
around College Station. The north gate area was

15:55.768 --> 15:58.011
the central. If you went off campus for 
businesses, and if you didn't go downtown Bryan,

15:58.497 --> 16:05.804
then the Northgate area was essentially where the 
businesses were. There were housing that a number

16:07.987 --> 16:13.572
of the factory lived in to the south. Those homes 
are still there. To the east of Eastgate, the older

16:20.399 --> 16:25.244
part of that was there at the time. And a number of 
the factory that I knew, two of them two of my

16:28.585 --> 16:30.828
petroleum professors lived over there. When I was 
a graduate student here, we rented, two friends of

16:31.889 --> 16:40.421
mine and I rented an apartment over near the East 
Gate. We used to go off campus to a Mexican

16:40.441 --> 16:43.665
restaurant. It was somewhere over about the 
Chimney Hill area. Maybe not quite that far, but,

16:48.972 --> 16:55.921
you know, that, it wasn't that far to drive, but it 
was sort of far out as far as it was concerned. It was

16:56.762 --> 16:58.204
sort of beyond the houses and That's what I thought 
so. What businesses were at Northgate?

17:05.522 --> 17:07.144
Lippox had a bookstore there. The campus theater 
was there and operating very well as a movie

17:08.586 --> 17:16.258
theater. I mean, it was a nice place to go. I can't 
remember the name, but the university bookstore

17:20.484 --> 17:23.548
was there. Later branched out to those places and 
called it a station. I think that photography shop

17:29.032 --> 17:32.478
on the corner was there. The boot shop was there. 
And a photographer came under name back on old

17:36.425 --> 17:48.485
college back off of the University block or two and 
was in there, still there I think. I haven't been in

17:48.505 --> 17:51.330
there in a number of years. That's about all I can 
remember. Must have been a couple of eating

17:53.534 --> 17:55.838
places, though. If you and I came by bus, where did 
we arrive and depart? Where was the bus station for

18:01.286 --> 18:06.134
College Station? I don't remember. I think it was 
Eastgate. What about the railroad? Well, the

18:09.038 --> 18:19.595
railroad is where the railroad is now, but the 
depot

18:09.038 --> 18:19.595
was right opposite the Grove in that area. That's 
the best way of describing it. and the creamery was

18:22.441 --> 18:24.703
nearby. Where, if you and I wanted to get an 
alcoholic beverage, where could we have gotten a

18:25.484 --> 18:32.330
drink? Well, for an old German from Brunham, 
they'd say this, but I don't really remember

18:33.391 --> 18:43.121
trying to find an alcoholic drink around here. I 
think I drank something when we'd go off on

18:44.902 --> 18:48.105
weekends to Houston or whatever. I drank beer or 
whatever, but I don't remember particularly

18:51.314 --> 18:54.379
searching for any around here. But there was the 
famous Whiskey Bridge out off of Highway, what is

18:54.399 --> 19:01.189
that, 50? 60. Going west on the campus, University 
Extension. As far as I know, that was legal and

19:07.799 --> 19:09.802
everything. Yeah, that was legal. That was over in 
Burleson County, which is, having had to be of age.

19:18.315 --> 19:19.617
Let's see, were there any... I can't think of any 
campus,

19:20.035 --> 19:29.243
big campus catastrophes, fires, or anything like 
that. There were no big campus events during your

19:29.263 --> 19:37.710
five years here, were

19:29.263 --> 19:37.710
there? No catastrophes like that that I can 
recall. At the inauguration of Dr. Harrington,

19:41.213 --> 19:46.377
were there any other big, special, one-of-a-kind 
events? The opening of the MSC was a big and Dr.

19:50.039 --> 19:55.267
Harrington's inauguration. Before I left here, 
before I graduated, Dr. Morgan, the president, I

19:55.808 --> 20:06.464
don't recall that there was an inauguration 
ceremony for him. I guess maybe Dr. Harrington's

20:06.484 --> 20:11.452
was the one. We had

20:16.735 --> 20:18.397
We had our problems. I was Colonel of the Corps my 
senior year, and it seemed like there was a problem

20:19.078 --> 20:26.209
every week of some sort or another. I didn't know 
that. So describe for me the process of going from

20:27.250 --> 20:37.065
the annex to becoming Corps Commander. When did 
you begin to realize you might have that potential

20:37.606 --> 20:44.416
and so forth? Well, you know, looking back on it, It 
was quite interesting. I didn't, you know, I came

20:48.253 --> 20:58.607
here from a tiny school and was awed by all these 
worldly people from Houston and places like that.

20:58.867 --> 21:15.008
And while I became really dear friends with three 
or four guys from Dallas, we started out in the

20:58.867 --> 21:15.008
barracks out there in Phoenix together and went to 
the unit that I mentioned earlier, Squadron 10 and

20:58.867 --> 21:15.008
the Corps together. And

21:16.540 --> 21:37.992
I guess, you know, in my sophomore year in Squadron 
10, toward the end of the year, when people were

21:16.540 --> 21:37.992
being picked for

21:16.540 --> 21:37.992
positions the coming year, when I was asked if I 
wanted to go into the Corps of Staff. And, you know,

21:39.374 --> 21:41.256
that was an honor. So, yeah, sure, I did. And then, I 
don't remember now, there were six or eight

21:44.418 --> 21:49.425
juniors that were put on the Coast Staff. I mean, as 
juniors who were on the Coast Staff. Maybe more,

21:54.131 --> 21:55.213
but I think about eight. And I didn't really expect 
to be a Corps Commander. I just thought, well, I'd

22:00.420 --> 22:05.587
go there and get that experience. And then maybe my 
senior year, I'd probably not go back to be a unit

22:05.607 --> 22:13.378
commander. There'd probably be a staff 
commander, or wing, or battalion, or something

22:14.202 --> 22:22.631
like that. I couldn't say battalion, too. We 
didn't have battalions in the Air Force. But we

22:29.638 --> 22:35.524
rotated, being what was called a sergeant major, 
the chief junior in the corps. And I was about the

22:35.544 --> 22:38.127
third or fourth one to rotate. I forget now how long 
we kept that job, about six weeks or something.

22:43.598 --> 22:54.128
During my rotation, I felt like I'd done a good job, 
and I felt like I was doing as well and maybe better

22:43.598 --> 22:54.128
than a couple of the others that I'd fought early 
on. Anyway, I don't know how it all happened. I was

22:57.211 --> 22:58.172
really surprised in the end. We went through, I

22:58.232 --> 23:07.822
don't recall exactly what it was, but we went 
before panels. Back in that time, as opposed to

23:08.702 --> 23:13.487
today, today people put their own name in if they 
want to. want that job, which was fine. Back at that

23:16.068 --> 23:19.613
time, we didn't, you know. People would, you know, 
I don't know how I was picked to be, to go before the

23:19.633 --> 23:23.057
panel. But anyway, I remember the interviews with 
some of the other cadets, seniors, and a number of

23:23.077 --> 23:36.355
the military officers on the panel, and talking to 
them, answering questions, and that kind of

23:23.077 --> 23:36.355
thing. And I guess, you know, in the end, I was 
surprised to be the one that was picked. And I'm

23:41.429 --> 23:50.742
assuming then as a senior you were part of the 
screening review group. As you now think of it from

23:51.703 --> 24:06.964
both sides of having been selected and having been 
one of those who would later help make the next

23:51.703 --> 24:06.964
selection, what were the key qualities that you 
think they were looking for?

24:10.049 --> 24:13.714
Certainly leadership, because that's a key 
thing. But a good part of leadership is

24:13.915 --> 24:31.199
personality, being able to get along with people, 
and not being able to leave without getting

24:13.915 --> 24:31.199
everybody all upset about what orders you have to 
give,

24:13.915 --> 24:31.199
that kind of thing. Academics certainly play the 
role, because this is an academic institution,

24:31.219 --> 24:38.790
and you don't necessarily want to pick a guy that's 
just about to bunk out. But I remember the fellow

24:39.648 --> 24:52.947
that followed me, who was picked, was on the poor 
staff also when I was a senior. You know, he was

24:52.967 --> 25:00.698
obviously of that group of juniors, the one that 
could do the best job.

25:00.718 --> 25:07.447
Do you think geography, parentage, family income 
played any part? Geography certainly didn't. My

25:10.242 --> 25:17.412
family income when I was here had no part at all.

25:19.314 --> 25:22.499
And parentage, of course, parentage does have a 
big role. Oh, no, but I mean the fact that you were

25:22.519 --> 25:28.327
Germanic or rich or poor. No, no, no. But the way 
your parents raised you and all that has

25:29.629 --> 25:34.996
tremendous . . . Of course. That was the thing that 
always impressed me about A&M. And in fact, it was

25:40.639 --> 25:51.091
one of the reasons that I, even before I got the 
opportunity or the scholarship to come here, that

25:40.639 --> 25:51.091
I was leaning toward A&M. Because I had been told 
some things about Texas University. And I had been

25:56.457 --> 26:01.203
told that if you go to A&M, you make it strictly on 
your own merit. It doesn't matter. And I saw that in

26:02.464 --> 26:07.570
action because in my barracks at the annex of a very 
wealthy man in Houston, a very, very big Aggie, and

26:07.853 --> 26:25.796
we all knew that early on, but you know, and I became 
great friends with him, but that had absolutely

26:07.853 --> 26:25.796
nothing to do with anything else. He got kidded 
some, we all got kidded about something early, so

26:25.816 --> 26:31.684
he was strictly on the and what you yourself could 
do. And I hope it's still that way. It is still your

26:37.712 --> 26:39.173
target. Let's stay with your senior year as Corps 
Commander. Describe a typical week's routine for

26:43.356 --> 26:48.801
the Corps Commander your senior year. Well, I 
think the main part of it was sort of the early few

26:50.482 --> 27:01.772
weeks getting started, getting things, I 
wouldn't say necessarily organized, because all

27:02.782 --> 27:16.474
of the cadet leaders had been picked and they were 
in place and all that, but it still takes a little

27:02.782 --> 27:16.474
bit for an organization to get functioning, 
getting used to each other, and getting used to

27:02.782 --> 27:16.474
your new role and that kind of thing. We had new 
freshmen on campus, getting all that going. Once

27:22.880 --> 27:26.043
beyond that, it became sort of a routine. You're 
all, your classes, you're still taking a, you

27:26.063 --> 27:32.569
know, in those days you took a heavy load of 
classes. I finished building a degree in four

27:33.528 --> 27:38.995
years, and I think I finished with about 156 hours. 
So I was taking 18, 19, 20 hours. And so had that go.

27:47.525 --> 27:51.490
Sort of typical was during the day, no particular 
problem. We were early morning formation, get our

27:51.510 --> 27:59.619
meal, go back to our room. We had a class, which you 
usually get fairly early, going off to class. It

28:04.578 --> 28:09.242
was after the classes where things really 
happened. A lot of core activities, always late in

28:10.904 --> 28:14.407
the afternoon. The units are practicing their 
marching, their drills, doing various things.

28:20.333 --> 28:24.537
Part of the military science classes are various 
labs. But as corps commander in the evenings,

28:24.557 --> 28:32.745
there were a number of people that generally 
stopped by. particularly right after we'd have

28:34.953 --> 28:37.717
our evening meal. They'd come over to my room and 
they had either something that, some bright idea

28:37.757 --> 28:47.870
that they wanted to try out or some gripe that they 
had about something or other. Some of them

28:47.890 --> 28:50.233
wouldn't even wait that long. They'd come up to the 
table. At that time, we served family style in

28:51.935 --> 28:56.541
Duncan. And so each unit had its own tables and the 
core staff sat at one particular table. Two

29:01.607 --> 29:03.610
tables, I guess, there in one place. And so 
everybody knew where we were. We'd take care of

29:07.790 --> 29:10.154
some of the business during the meal. Do you 
remember any particular incident or problem you

29:10.875 --> 29:14.781
had to cope with? You know, it's funny what sticks 
in your mind or pops back, but a kid, a good friend of

29:14.801 --> 29:26.960
mine, every time I see him now, because it sort of 
saved my, I wouldn't say my skin, but it saved

29:14.801 --> 29:26.960
embarrassment. At one point, we were eating, and I 
was sitting at the head of the table, and he was just

29:30.303 --> 29:35.389
to my right, so our legs were so close together. 
This senior friend of mine came up, and he was, I was

29:36.631 --> 29:48.144
Air Force, and the previous corps commander had 
been Air Force out of the same unit. And this guy

29:48.164 --> 29:59.618
came over with the drive, and this was, I don't 
know, this was well into the fall semester, way

29:48.164 --> 29:59.618
past everything happening, but he just said, well 
then it's not right, but Corps Commander, two

29:59.834 --> 30:07.922
years in a row, out of the Air Force, out of the same 
unit. Or out of the Army, and so on. And he said

30:09.023 --> 30:16.470
something else, which I don't really remember now 
exactly what happened, but it sort of irritated

30:09.023 --> 30:16.470
me, and I started to stand up and argue with him. And 
when I started to go up, my friend to my right jammed

30:16.490 --> 30:23.777
my legs, and I couldn't get up. It made me sit back 
down, and so I sort of, that broke my tension. I

30:28.081 --> 30:28.862
almost had to laugh. So I just sort of said, oh, you 
know, Jimmy, forget about it. We're going back

30:33.631 --> 30:36.033
here. So, you know, things like that. But it's a 
great learning experience. Really a tremendous

30:39.297 --> 30:40.378
learning experience. So you didn't have any 
hazing, nothing caught fire? We had hazing

30:44.202 --> 30:46.805
incidents. We had one unit shut down early on. One 
unit actually disbanded. What did they do? They

30:54.853 --> 30:57.076
were hazing. They had a board, I think. And

30:59.251 --> 31:09.466
I know that was a learning experience, 
particularly for the unit commander at that time.

31:09.486 --> 31:11.609
Unfortunately, he should have learned a little 
earlier. But he and several people came over to the

31:12.831 --> 31:18.399
Corps staff area and said, well, you've got to 
help. What's the problem? Well, we're being

31:20.903 --> 31:22.245
disbanded. Well, what happened? Well, they 
caught us with a bullet. What can I do? What do you

31:29.054 --> 31:30.861
think I can do about that? Well, you've got to help. 
I said, listen, there's nothing I can do. You guys

31:35.340 --> 31:36.565
knew the rules.
