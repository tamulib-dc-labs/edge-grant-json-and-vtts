WEBVTT

00:06.629 --> 00:14.761
The plan was particularly effective and accepted 
by the vast majority of the people in the city. And

00:15.983 --> 00:29.823
not only that, whenever we had a bond issue and it 
was known that the bond issue was in accordance

00:15.983 --> 00:29.823
with the plan, it passed overwhelmingly. And 
every time We approached a state or federal

00:33.308 --> 00:37.974
agency. We showed them the plan, showed them what 
the city was doing, and then outlined the part that

00:39.897 --> 00:53.055
we thought that particular agency should be 
responsible for. And invariably, we came away

00:57.372 --> 01:06.942
with the acceptance of the agency of our request 
and they granted the request and they followed the

00:57.372 --> 01:06.942
plan. So the plan was followed very 
conscientiously from the very beginning. The

01:13.389 --> 01:22.659
only thing that was not done was the community 
would not accept urban renewal. So the plan was

01:22.679 --> 01:26.923
implemented

01:28.051 --> 01:38.465
financed

01:28.051 --> 01:38.465
with all the different agencies participating.

01:46.977 --> 01:57.552
The Area Development Committee decided in 1949 
and 1950

01:46.977 --> 01:57.552
to proceed with the plan. It took three years to 
complete the plan, and it was published in 1953.

02:03.655 --> 02:17.327
The

02:03.655 --> 02:17.327
plan was

02:03.655 --> 02:17.327
virtually completed in the early 1960s. All of the 
proposals had been accomplished

02:18.208 --> 02:28.517
in the early 1960s. And so the Area Development 
Committee, which remained active the full time,

02:29.442 --> 02:50.927
decided that an update of the plan was needed, that 
they needed new goals and objectives. So they went

02:52.489 --> 02:55.973
back again to the Bartholomew Organization, and 
asked them to update the plan. That

03:01.646 --> 03:15.886
firm went to work and completed their plan and 
submitted the final report in December 1967. The

03:16.066 --> 03:24.778
second plan was technically very well done. The 
goals and objectives were not as clear as in the

03:30.173 --> 03:38.921
original plan. That

03:38.961 --> 03:50.371
plan is still being used as a guide. And a number of 
the things have been accomplished. one of which

03:56.990 --> 04:16.778
was Corpus Christi Beach, or North Beach, the area 
north of the ship channel

03:56.990 --> 04:16.778
to Nueces and

03:56.990 --> 04:16.778
Nueces Bay.

04:21.324 --> 04:25.410
A request was made to the Corps of Engineers to 
restore the beach. A great deal of

04:27.128 --> 04:43.969
demolition of substandard dwellings, Corpus 
Christi's own version of urban renewal without

04:27.128 --> 04:43.969
federal assistance, was undertaken. And a great 
many of the substandard housing that existed on

04:44.049 --> 04:50.037
that beach was eliminated.

04:53.140 --> 04:56.865
An act was secured. through Congress for the use of 
the Beach Erosion Act to restore the sand beach in

04:57.368 --> 05:19.277
this area that had eroded back to and even under 
some of the buildings. It took 10 years of constant

05:21.680 --> 05:25.485
effort to get this plan

05:27.457 --> 05:37.167
completed and implemented through the Corps of 
Engineers. The

05:39.249 --> 05:54.865
restoration of the beach was accomplished in 
about 1978 or 1979.

05:58.473 --> 06:27.788
Another one of the objectives was the 
construction of a dam, another water supply,

05:58.473 --> 06:27.788
because the lake at Mathis had a limited capacity 
and could not accommodate the expanding

05:58.473 --> 06:27.788
industrial and domestic demand

05:58.473 --> 06:27.788
for water.

06:30.755 --> 06:35.240
Controversy arose as to the location of this dam. 
The area development plan did recommend the site

06:35.260 --> 06:58.905
that is now being completed for

06:35.260 --> 06:58.905
the new dam at Cho Canyon.

07:00.083 --> 07:12.219
The dam was

07:00.083 --> 07:12.219
partially financed through the Bureau of 
Reclamation.

07:12.239 --> 07:28.420
The gates of this dam are going to be closed within 
the next two months, and this lake will furnish a

07:12.239 --> 07:28.420
water supply

07:12.239 --> 07:28.420
well into the 2020s.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.564
This is just finished now. That's just finished. 
That's another accomplishment of the plan.

07:41.996 --> 07:49.887
Bill, tell me, how did this project that I don't 
know very much about, the goals for Corpus

07:41.996 --> 07:49.887
Christi, how did that relate? The what? Goals for 
Corpus Christi project. Goals for Corpus

07:52.370 --> 07:53.652
Christi? How did that relate to the Area 
Development Committee's work? Well, the Area

07:57.237 --> 07:59.740
Development Committee did support the program 
for the goals of Corpus Christi. A number of

08:07.389 --> 08:15.280
committees were established, and the goals were 
outlined and published. But unfortunately,

08:17.102 --> 08:27.516
not very much has been done to follow up on it. It's a 
nice book, and quite a few people have it, but very

08:30.010 --> 08:39.704
little reference is ever made to it now. Not nearly 
as effective as the one they had in Dallas.

08:46.753 --> 08:49.477
The Area Development Committee did give support 
to that. It was a more or less independent effort,

08:51.620 --> 08:56.627
aside from the Area Development Committee. Yes. 
They had their own They had their own employee that

08:59.322 --> 09:07.233
did all the groundwork and assembled it and put it 
together. Did it have any direct relationship to

09:08.215 --> 09:12.481
the planning department?

09:16.466 --> 09:16.606
No, no. And what about any direct relationship to 
municipal government? Well, the mayor and the

09:23.036 --> 09:27.642
council gave it encouragement. But I don't think 
they did anything to really implement it. Nor the

09:37.302 --> 09:40.347
county government, nor the school district. 
Neither of them did anything very spectacular to

09:40.367 --> 09:46.275
support it. This comprehensive plan did contain 
several things that had a program for the

09:57.153 --> 09:58.815
restoration of the central city.

10:03.260 --> 10:17.898
It had a plan for an outer belt parkway system at the 
Cayo del Oso, which is a creek on the perimeter of

10:03.260 --> 10:17.898
the city. Nothing has been done with that except 
there have been some committees that have been

10:19.299 --> 10:24.966
working at it. But that's one of the goals and one of 
the challenges that still remain for the city to

10:25.722 --> 10:33.589
do.

10:41.616 --> 10:46.800
Major changes in land use or the school system.

10:50.464 --> 10:54.447
There was a plan for

10:55.895 --> 11:07.052
the

10:55.895 --> 11:07.052
Oso Bay to fill in sections of it and develop it. 
This was unacceptable to the environmental

11:07.072 --> 11:17.046
interests and has not been accomplished. There 
was a feasibility study made to determine if a

11:24.734 --> 11:31.682
offshore roadway could be built from downtown to 
the south end of the city. This proved to be not

11:33.283 --> 11:43.555
feasible.

11:43.575 --> 11:50.522
Offshore road

11:43.575 --> 11:50.522
was several thousand feet off the shore. It had 
islands in connection with it that were could be

11:55.582 --> 12:05.356
developed, both as residential and 
recreational,

11:55.582 --> 12:05.356
with connections into the shoreline. But the plan 
was entirely too expensive and was

12:07.438 --> 12:18.554
environmentally not acceptable.

12:18.574 --> 12:25.183
In 1962,

12:18.574 --> 12:25.183
thereabouts,

12:26.227 --> 12:53.382
The federal government enacted the

12:26.227 --> 12:53.382
federal government provided through the

12:26.227 --> 12:53.382
U.S. Bureau of Public Roads

12:26.227 --> 12:53.382
federal highway agency the opportunity to 
prepare transportation plans for cities. Corpus

12:58.842 --> 13:04.010
Christi was the first city in the United States to 
apply for such a plan. The local district

13:06.574 --> 13:21.597
engineer, Theo Foster, was entirely sympathetic 
and agreed to help us go before the State Highway

13:06.574 --> 13:21.597
Commission and seek approval of the preparation 
of this plan.

13:31.157 --> 13:36.124
Local people went there, the political leaders. 
The Area Development Committee was interested

13:36.966 --> 13:44.917
and helped, but did not take an active part.

13:49.043 --> 13:52.107
We did get approval of the State Highway 
Department. to proceed. The State Highway

13:57.406 --> 14:20.073
Department had no planners on the staff, but 
assigned some very good engineers that were

13:57.406 --> 14:20.073
progressive and wanted to prepare a good plan. The 
city and the county the navigation district, and

14:25.060 --> 14:44.557
all agreed to assist

14:25.060 --> 14:44.557
in the preparation of this plan by providing 
technical assistance and staff.

14:45.498 --> 14:54.105
As city planner, I was assigned to this committee, 
and we had at least two members of our planning

14:54.743 --> 15:04.574
staff that worked with the highway engineers that 
were assigned to this. Do you remember their

15:05.736 --> 15:10.481
names? One of them was

15:10.501 --> 15:15.487
Earl Goetsch. How does he spell that? 
G-O-E-T-S-C-H. He was a senior planner. And we had

15:24.562 --> 15:30.549
the traffic engineer, Tom Stewart. We had public 
works director. And

15:38.299 --> 15:53.117
we had the right to call in as we needed them. of the 
other city staff. The county engineer was on this,

15:56.662 --> 16:06.835
Jesse Lawrence

15:56.662 --> 16:06.835
participated, and we had regular meetings.

16:10.059 --> 16:20.893
And we outlined what should be in the 
transportation plan. And this was a pioneering

16:21.920 --> 16:27.248
effort because it was, and we were considered the 
guinea pig. And so we prepared our outline, which

16:28.890 --> 16:51.522
contained such subjects as economic factors, 
population, land use,

16:28.890 --> 16:51.522
the inventory of transportation facilities, 
studies on travel patterns, terminals and

16:52.463 --> 17:13.972
transfer facilities, traffic engineering, 
community controls, financial resources, and

16:52.463 --> 17:13.972
methods of financing the

16:52.463 --> 17:13.972
plan. And then there was a long range plan for the 
major street system. proposed.

17:25.775 --> 17:31.443
This plan was prepared and completed in 1964. And 
as required by the federal legislation, the city

17:32.224 --> 17:42.778
council was asked to adopt it. And they did. And

17:44.681 --> 17:50.449
they The plan was very well followed, 
particularly as to major streets

17:50.885 --> 17:59.315
and thoroughfares.

18:02.119 --> 18:09.388
But each year, in accordance with the federal 
legislation, this plan was to be updated. So a

18:09.448 --> 18:16.757
supplement was prepared each year on this plan.

18:20.045 --> 18:44.300
Today, very little is being done with updating the 
comprehensive city plan,

18:20.045 --> 18:44.300
but through the transportation planning and the 
various committees that were established at that

18:20.045 --> 18:44.300
time, there has been some updating done. The city 
manager during

18:49.981 --> 19:09.069
the period from 1967 to 1980,

18:49.981 --> 19:09.069
was

18:49.981 --> 19:09.069
not interested in updating the comprehensive 
plan. Why was that? Well,

19:12.033 --> 19:18.182
he felt that Most of the updating could be done on an 
administrative basis through the city manager's

19:18.584 --> 19:26.476
office. Why did you feel that the city manager's 
office was qualified to do the updating of

19:26.516 --> 19:36.731
professional planning material? Well, the city 
manager himself was a

19:38.213 --> 19:46.245
graduate of a planning school. His degree was in 
administration, but he had taken all of the

19:48.031 --> 19:56.479
comprehensive planning at Cornell.

20:01.423 --> 20:09.150
Well, what did the planning director have to say 
about this arrangement?

20:09.170 --> 20:18.038
The planning director informally

20:09.170 --> 20:18.038
did proceed with some updating of the plans that 
was me

20:18.524 --> 20:47.535
but as separate reports as not as part of the 
comprehensive plan

20:18.524 --> 20:47.535
separate report on specific projects mostly

20:18.524 --> 20:47.535
Marvin Townsend he was a very competent city 
manager When did he—was he hired by the city? Yes,

20:51.776 --> 20:53.718
he was hired by the city. When? Oh, he was started 
out

20:55.640 --> 21:12.279
in

20:55.640 --> 21:12.279
the fifties, and he came up through the ranks to be 
city manager. And then he left about— He left in

21:12.299 --> 21:16.324
1981.

21:18.211 --> 21:20.133
Who is the city manager now? The city manager now is 
Mr. Martin, who was brought in here and formerly

21:20.153 --> 21:31.805
city manager for Evanston, Illinois.

21:31.825 --> 21:36.529
He's just getting started.

21:36.549 --> 21:45.679
I know nothing about his interest in planning.

21:45.699 --> 21:47.020
Today, Michael Gunning. who is the 
transportation planner, does a great deal of

21:48.383 --> 21:58.837
planning through that. For instance, all 
subdivisions have to be approved by the

21:58.877 --> 22:17.361
transportation planning section as it relates to 
streets and highways. a generation of traffic and

22:17.678 --> 22:30.032
land use.

22:30.052 --> 22:43.908
I retired in 1973

22:30.052 --> 22:43.908
from the city after 27 years of continuous 
services director of planning. My successor was

22:48.357 --> 22:50.519
Mr. Larry Winger. But there was this change in the 
administrative

22:52.061 --> 22:58.007
organization. There was a man that was called

22:59.869 --> 23:10.739
Director of Planning and Urban Development. And 
this man's

23:16.572 --> 23:37.161
principal responsibilities were to implement 
the federal

23:16.572 --> 23:37.161
programs that were

23:16.572 --> 23:37.161
being used by the city, housing programs and 
welfare programs and programs of that kind. Mr.

23:38.483 --> 23:44.031
Wenger, who was called the planner, continued to 
do essentially what I had done for 27 years. There

23:54.225 --> 24:04.240
has been a later revision of the administrative 
plan, and Mr. Wenger is now the director of

23:54.225 --> 24:04.240
planning again.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.087
Very little is being done now. Do they still have a 
director of urban development? Well, yes,

24:14.032 --> 24:21.200
there's still one there, and that's at a higher 
level. I see. That's in the manager's office?

24:24.443 --> 24:28.007
That's in the manager's office, and Mr. Winger is 
responsible to him.

24:31.471 --> 24:37.457
Prior to that time, when I was director of 
planning, I was directly responsible to the city

24:31.471 --> 24:37.457
manager.

24:44.373 --> 24:48.639
The Area Development Committee is still in 
existence.

24:50.542 --> 24:56.611
It is an autonomous committee of the Chamber of 
Commerce. They select their own membership, and

24:58.574 --> 25:12.675
they're appointed for long terms, six years, I 
think.

25:13.837 --> 25:17.521
They provide their own financing for anything 
they do. The only thing that I know of recently that

25:17.741 --> 25:35.998
they have done, they supported a review of the plan 
for the Bayfront

25:17.741 --> 25:35.998
by Sasaki Walker Organization.

25:39.381 --> 25:41.143
Their man came down here. and made some study and 
made a few suggestions which

25:41.765 --> 25:56.487
were constructive.

25:56.507 --> 25:56.567
OK. Bill,

25:57.003 --> 26:21.405
I'm going to be interviewing several other people 
in Corpus Christi, and I'd like to have any of your

25:57.003 --> 26:21.405
ideas on any additional persons. But one person 
that comes to mind is Ruth Gill, who was on the city

26:21.425 --> 26:23.787
council for some time, and now she's with the COG. 
And then Tom Brown, for his role as executive

26:23.807 --> 26:25.129
director of the COG. And I understand that he's 
going to be transferring over to the navigation

26:25.149 --> 26:26.790
system. To where? Navigation

26:28.110 --> 26:31.815
District. And I was thinking I should probably 
interview Larry and Michael Gunning. Yeah. And

26:40.488 --> 26:43.393
just get their views on things. Yeah, they're both 
very good people to get their views on. Ruth Gill

26:49.001 --> 26:54.870
was a very active person on the city council. She 
was very sympathetic to the planning programs.

27:00.491 --> 27:11.872
She eventually became active in the Council of 
Governments, and she

27:00.491 --> 27:11.872
has been chairman of a good many committees. One of 
the committees she was chairman of was the Oso

27:11.912 --> 27:18.985
Parkway Committee. And she was trying to find a 
means to implement that plan. And as far as I know,

27:27.843 --> 27:30.886
the committee is still active. I'm a member of that

27:30.906 --> 27:39.454
committee. Well, I think the city is a much better 
place because we had a city plan, a good

27:39.475 --> 27:50.305
comprehensive plan that was

27:51.668 --> 28:10.325
a plan of the people, the leadership, both 
economic and political, were able to work

27:51.668 --> 28:10.325
together, as well as a big segment of the citizens. 
And as far as I have been able to learn, that they're

28:12.127 --> 28:18.773
very happy with the results of the

28:19.917 --> 28:35.815
plan.

28:35.835 --> 28:41.961
We're in the office of Michael Gunning, senior 
planner for the planning department of Corpus

28:35.835 --> 28:41.961
Christi. This is the 29th of May, 1982. and Michael 
is going to tell us a little bit about his personal,

28:45.685 --> 28:59.189
professional history, how he came to be in Corpus 
Christi, and then go on with some topics that have

28:45.685 --> 28:59.189
already been discussed. Michael? Bob, I happen to 
be one of those planners who walked into a, a

29:10.424 --> 29:12.427
temporary job. It was at least temporary in my mind 
when I first took the job under Jonathan

29:12.487 --> 29:18.976
Cunningham with the Department of Planning with 
the city of El Paso. I had graduated from Texas

29:19.897 --> 29:27.548
Western College, now the University of Texas at El 
Paso in 1966. I went ahead and completed one year of

29:27.728 --> 29:38.423
law school at Texas Tech University and returned 
home in the summer of 68 and married and shortly

29:38.842 --> 29:45.711
thereafter my wife became pregnant with her first 
child, not wanting to go back to law school,

29:38.842 --> 29:45.711
completely broke. I ran into a few friends of mine 
who had started work with the Department of

29:47.714 --> 29:56.486
Planning, Jim Sorensen primarily, who told me 
that I ought to come in and speak with Jonathan

29:47.714 --> 29:56.486
Cunningham. And I did, and Jonathan hired me 
basically on the spot to to work with some

30:05.234 --> 30:12.002
projects, special research projects that he had 
set up. And I started the Department of Planning as

30:12.803 --> 30:17.489
a planning technician for $425 a month. And that 
was back in September of 1968. I stayed with the

30:23.476 --> 30:29.484
city of El Paso until March of 1973. And during my 
years with El Paso, working with John Cunningham

30:33.331 --> 30:40.664
and under his senior planners and assistant 
director, Bill Adams, and at one time Nestor

30:33.331 --> 30:40.664
Valencia. He had moved me through every aspect of 
planning that one could imagine. My first job was

30:48.117 --> 30:57.634
to update to a community facilities inventory for 
the city of El Paso, which was very surprising

30:48.117 --> 30:57.634
being a life, a long resident of El Paso and and 
having to do the community facilities inventory

30:58.120 --> 31:06.792
taught me that I really didn't know as much about 
the city as I originally thought. And the second

31:07.613 --> 31:19.771
project John put me on was to coordinate the 
updating of all the land uses in El Paso, which was a

31:07.613 --> 31:19.771
very eye-opening type of assignment. And it 
really made me very familiar with the city and some

31:20.732 --> 31:27.081
of its problems. And with the completion of the 
plan.
