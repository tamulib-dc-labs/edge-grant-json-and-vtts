00:01.533 --> 00:04.115
Three, two, one.

00:09.460 --> 00:18.768
Tape interview, Donald Ouellette interviewing 
Hoyt Haddock, December 23, 1982, Washington, DC.

00:19.829 --> 00:25.894
Mr. Haddock, could you please give me some general 
biographical background as to your date of birth?

00:27.075 --> 00:30.898
Well, I was born May 5, 1907.

00:31.807 --> 00:36.672
on a farm about four miles from Boyd, Texas. That's 
in Wise County. Decatur is the county seat.

00:48.363 --> 00:59.113
And my father was a sharecropper, and we lived on 
the farm until

01:01.034 --> 01:14.691
Oh, I guess,

01:01.034 --> 01:14.691
as I remember, we moved from a farm to Decatur and 
lived in Decatur a while. Then we moved from

01:14.731 --> 01:29.910
Decatur to Greenwood, back on another farm, and 
then from Greenwood to Lubbock, Lubbock back to

01:14.731 --> 01:29.910
Fort Worth, where I really grew up. I lived in Fort 
Worth until I left there in 1927 to go to Galveston

01:31.612 --> 01:40.825
to take a ship. In Fort Worth I went to, well, may as 
well tell you about the schooling I didn't have. I

01:48.837 --> 01:57.670
finished grade school and I think it was in the 
tenth grade of high school when I quit high school

01:48.837 --> 01:57.670
for economic reasons. Basically, I didn't have 
shoes to wear or clothes to wear to school.

02:07.598 --> 02:17.992
I quit, quit there, quit school and took a job at 
Armour and Company in their fancy meat cooler. I

02:19.194 --> 02:29.007
was a,

02:19.194 --> 02:29.007
my job was called box boy. I put boxes together and 
then put lids on them when they would fill them up

02:29.813 --> 02:45.810
with the fancy meats, fancy meats being tongues 
and livers and hearts and this sort of thing, the

02:29.813 --> 02:45.810
various organs.

02:50.155 --> 02:56.682
That job petered out because of the economic 
conditions then prevalent in the area. and I got a

02:58.619 --> 03:01.322
job at Montgomery Wards.

03:04.385 --> 03:11.953
There I was a stockman for several divisions 
before I left there. Again, I was laid off because

03:12.773 --> 03:17.138
of economic conditions. This was about in the 
mid-20s,

03:17.598 --> 03:26.027
and I guess The economic conditions in Texas were 
worse than anywhere in the country at the time. I

03:32.007 --> 03:40.239
can recall my father going literally for two years 
without a day's work. He was a cabinetmaker.

03:45.145 --> 03:48.690
He also did some contracting and carpenter work. 
He'd do anything he could get to do. Things were

03:51.134 --> 03:55.660
that bad in Texas at that time.

03:56.365 --> 04:02.875
As I recall, this was about 1922 or 23 when he was out 
of work for so long. So we've seen some hard times on

04:05.439 --> 04:08.764
the farm and off the farm. The last farm that we were 
on was the one in Greenwood. We had 100 acres, and

04:15.695 --> 04:20.162
practically the whole 100 acres were put in 
cotton. and I guess for the first time the family

04:21.577 --> 04:35.958
got out of debt on that cotton because it was during 
a war time, World War I, and cotton prices went up

04:21.577 --> 04:35.958
and did pretty good on it.

04:42.587 --> 04:48.816
In Fort Worth, after getting laid off from 
Brantley, from

04:51.277 --> 04:55.761
Montgomery

04:51.277 --> 04:55.761
Wards. I had gotten interested in radio and 
decided I wanted to be a radio operator on a ship. So

05:03.950 --> 05:19.545
I went to Bratley Drawn, which was a commercial 
school, private school, and took radio for the

05:03.950 --> 05:19.545
purpose of getting my commercial radio officers, 
radio operators license, it was called at that

05:03.950 --> 05:19.545
time, And after having gotten that, I went to 
Galveston and shipped out. My first ship was in

05:26.563 --> 05:31.111
December the 27th.

05:40.227 --> 05:41.048
I think 1927. I'm not sure of that date. I'll have to 
check that date. I have it at home. And I relieved

05:49.208 --> 05:53.194
someone who wanted to be home for Christmas. And I 
stayed on the Tilly Likes until I

05:55.317 --> 06:03.128
really don't know how long. But the company wanted 
me to take the West Comac. This was a government

06:08.837 --> 06:16.768
ship operated by Likes Brothers, shipping board 
that was called at that time, the government

06:08.837 --> 06:16.768
agency. And I took that ship west come back and 
spent a little time on her. And I don't remember

06:27.053 --> 06:34.826
whether I got off because the ship laid up or for 
what reason now. But I went from there to the ER camp

06:36.128 --> 06:45.102
of the Sinclair Navigation Company, Sinclair 
Refining.

06:47.782 --> 06:55.311
And from that ship I came ashore as a radio operator 
at WPA, Port Arthur, Texas. It's a station that was

06:55.331 --> 07:12.350
originally built by the Gulf Refining Company but 
later taken over by the Radio Marine Corporation

06:55.331 --> 07:12.350
of America as a result of a contract they made with 
the Gulf to furnish their radio equipment and

06:55.331 --> 07:12.350
service it and so forth.

07:15.294 --> 07:17.316
And I was there until Shipping really went bad. 
About 50% of the ships got tied up, and the station

07:22.553 --> 07:34.024
had to cut back on its

07:22.553 --> 07:34.024
personnel. And I shipped out again on a Gulf tanker 
for a few months. I don't remember how long. And

07:41.771 --> 07:46.155
then Port Arthur wanted me back, and I came back to 
Port Arthur. And I stayed there until 1933. In

07:50.575 --> 08:15.113
1930,

07:50.575 --> 08:15.113
I

07:50.575 --> 08:15.113
had been soliciting

07:50.575 --> 08:15.113
members, getting radio officers to join the 
American Radio Telegraphist Association, of

07:50.575 --> 08:15.113
which I became a member. This was a union of radio 
operators. What was it? Did it have a national

08:23.292 --> 08:24.793
affiliation? No affiliation. American Radio 
Telegraphist Association.

08:32.882 --> 08:44.155
And

08:32.882 --> 08:44.155
they asked me to run for president, and I told them 
that I would run for president, provided the they

08:45.367 --> 08:52.275
would let me stay in Port Arthur because I didn't 
want to act as, didn't want an active presidency in

08:45.367 --> 08:52.275
the Union.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.282
And I didn't want to go to New York.

09:01.306 --> 09:05.751
So, 1931,

09:01.306 --> 09:05.751
there was an election. I was elected president. 
They counted the ballots at night and sent me a

09:08.975 --> 09:14.361
telegram, which I got the next morning. long 
telegram telling me that the, if I wanted a union,

09:15.320 --> 09:35.417
I'd better come to New York and take over because 
the then secretary treasurer had not been in the

09:15.320 --> 09:35.417
office in six or seven weeks and was frequently 
seen drunk in the gutter in New York. And they

09:36.398 --> 09:44.145
didn't think that he would ever be able to keep the 
union together. So I, my wife and I packed our stuff

09:46.454 --> 09:55.624
and we went to, got in our little Ford and drove up to 
New York. And I became an active unionist at that

09:58.066 --> 10:02.711
time. I became president, in fact. And 
interesting enough, when I got to New York, there

10:07.476 --> 10:15.465
were 31 paid up members of the union.

10:18.652 --> 10:32.470
And I stayed with the Union until 1937

10:18.652 --> 10:32.470
and I'm told the membership at least a year ahead of 
that that I did not want to run again for

10:18.652 --> 10:32.470
presidency. That I wanted to

10:34.412 --> 10:41.161
stay in the industry and I wanted to do other 
things.

10:45.807 --> 10:47.950
Actually, I had set a timetable on what I wanted to 
do. I had wanted to go to sea for two years. Then I had

10:56.505 --> 11:03.114
wanted to come ashore for three or four years as an 
operator in a coastal station. Incidentally,

11:05.478 --> 11:12.668
while I was at Port Arthur, I changed from an 
operator to maintenance and repair and

11:05.478 --> 11:12.668
installation. In other words, installing radio 
equipment electronic equipment on ships,

11:16.330 --> 11:20.155
servicing it, maintaining it. And after three or 
four years in that work, I wanted to become part of

11:22.898 --> 11:34.732
the Federal Communications Commission in 
Washington. It wasn't the Federal

11:35.954 --> 11:41.260
Communications Commission then, it was the radio 
division of the Department of Commerce. Anyway,

11:42.281 --> 11:45.325
that was the steps that I had set out for myself to 
take. Anyway, the union changed all of that. I had

11:54.900 --> 11:58.547
not planned to be a trade unionist. It wasn't in my 
schedule at all. It was just one of these quirks in

12:01.772 --> 12:06.039
life that come along.

12:08.764 --> 12:10.266
Anyway, in New York,

12:13.267 --> 12:25.880
I became, of course, president of the American 
Radio-Telegraph Association, and that led into,

12:13.267 --> 12:25.880
of course, my association with the National 
Maritime Union.

12:29.163 --> 12:41.316
In 1936, the, I think this was 36, I'm not sure of 
these dates, you'll have to check these dates

12:29.163 --> 12:41.316
against material which you have. These records 
will show the dates.

12:51.352 --> 13:10.476
The famous California strike and them coming back 
to New York and trying to set up a viable trade

12:51.352 --> 13:10.476
union, which of course was fought hand in tooth by 
the then

13:11.418 --> 13:26.601
International Seaman's Union's hierarchy, 
which were basically in cahoots with the

13:11.418 --> 13:26.601
steamship companies and not interested really in 
the membership. The only thing they were

13:26.681 --> 13:31.108
interested in is controlling the membership so 
that they could make money. Did you ever have any

13:32.890 --> 13:38.318
dealings with the presidents of the different 
divisions? I had dealings with all of them. We

13:42.147 --> 13:48.115
tried, of course, to get the cooperation of all of 
the maritime unions. And we could get that

13:49.297 --> 13:53.402
cooperation as long as it was coming from us to 
them. But the other way, we never got it from any of

13:54.163 --> 14:02.755
them, including the Longshoremen's Association 
at that time. Joe Ryan was head of the

14:04.277 --> 14:07.301
Longshoremen's Association. I can remember the 
first strike we had.

14:13.957 --> 14:24.207
United States lines cut the wages of the radio 
operators on their ships

14:13.957 --> 14:24.207
a very large sum. I don't remember what the figures 
were, but there was a very large cut in the wages of

14:24.267 --> 14:30.053
the radio operators.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.258
This was when? This would have been 1934

14:35.278 --> 14:40.723
or 35.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.653
I'm not sure when.

14:50.679 --> 15:02.816
If you want those dates, you will have to try the 
American Radio Association office in New York for

14:50.679 --> 15:02.816
them because they would have all the back issues of 
the publications that we put out at that time.

15:08.243 --> 15:13.090
It became apparent to me that we were probably 
going to have to strike that company because we

15:13.762 --> 15:21.833
could not get a meeting with any of the officials of 
the United States lines.

15:25.759 --> 15:41.862
So I sent out an invitation, a written invitation 
to all of the unions that I had any association with

15:25.759 --> 15:41.862
or thought should be involved in this because it 
was going to affect them. for a meeting called at

15:43.495 --> 15:51.665
our then headquarters, which was 20 Irving Place 
in New York.

15:55.610 --> 16:01.137
We addressed a letter to all of the divisions of the 
International Seaman's Union. They had a

16:01.177 --> 16:05.202
stewards department, a deck department, and an 
engine department.

16:08.346 --> 16:09.688
Then there was a master mates and pilots, marine 
engineers,

16:10.951 --> 16:30.292
the ILA, of course, International 
Longshoremen's Association, and there was a

16:10.951 --> 16:30.292
Marine Workers Industrial Union, which was 
commie-controlled. I did not know that at the

16:31.373 --> 16:37.920
time, but anyway, they were commie-controlled, 
and no They didn't try to maintain it a secret. They

16:41.203 --> 16:46.068
made it very plain the officers were communists. 
They told me outright they were communists.

16:50.253 --> 16:57.260
Anyway, I did invite them also because they were 
one of the unions in the maritime field. And

16:59.643 --> 17:07.992
strange as it may seem, although I had frequent 
meetings with the ISU,

17:08.630 --> 17:20.567
officials, and we were supposed to be 
cooperating, the only union that showed up

17:08.630 --> 17:20.567
willing to help us was this Marine Workers 
Industrial Union. So, I laid out what I was, what I

17:20.587 --> 17:27.476
thought we ought to do, and they had some ideas on 
what should be done. And anyway, we, we called a

17:27.597 --> 17:36.409
strike, and they were the only ones that really 
gave us any help in that strike.

17:46.227 --> 18:07.226
The next, I guess the next really important thing 
in the marine field was then the California and it

17:46.227 --> 18:07.226
coming back to New York and them trying to set up a 
headquarters and it turned out that they could not

17:46.227 --> 18:07.226
rent a place for headquarters because everyone 
was putting in a plug against them. If they found

18:07.306 --> 18:14.192
that they were about to rent some place, the 
company would call, call the

18:16.889 --> 18:32.833
Steamship industry people would call up, and the 
old SIU unions and the ILA would call up the people

18:16.889 --> 18:32.833
who owned the place and tell them not to rent to that 
bunch of communists. It turned out that I went and

18:34.795 --> 18:42.767
rented a place for them in the name of the ARA and got 
phones in. It was American Radio Telegraph

18:42.787 --> 18:46.052
Association. at that time and got telephones for 
them, which we paid for, and

18:46.673 --> 18:58.631
set up a headquarters for the strikers, the 
seamen. Why would your union want to get involved

19:00.093 --> 19:05.481
with these striking factions? Because it was 
perfectly plain to me that if we were going to have a

19:06.362 --> 19:15.195
union that meant anything, we were going to have to 
worked with seamen who were interested in better

19:15.817 --> 19:22.366
conditions for the seafaring people. Why do you 
think at this time, late 35, early 36, why all of a

19:24.288 --> 19:42.973
sudden were seamen getting involved in the unions 
again since the unions per se hadn't been strong

19:24.288 --> 19:42.973
since after the 1921 maritime strike? Why all of a 
sudden 1935, 36?

19:47.137 --> 19:54.168
Why did a large amount of seamen become 
politically active and union active? Well, I

19:54.188 --> 20:09.031
think it was basically because this

19:54.188 --> 20:09.031
was really sort of an age of social conscience of 
people. Not only seamen, but a lot of people.

20:12.500 --> 20:18.646
became more social conscious, more conscious of 
the needs of the working people.

20:23.892 --> 20:33.201
There was a movement of the whole population, 
really.

20:36.104 --> 20:40.228
You will recall that in that time period, The whole 
movement of liberals in the country

20:41.120 --> 20:52.431
started to try to help working people. We had, of 
course, all of the

20:53.472 --> 21:02.281
government laws that were designed to help 
working people. The National Labor Relations Act

21:03.342 --> 21:08.207
was an outgrowth of this whole thing. There was a 
lot of labor legislation at that time. And I think

21:14.818 --> 21:22.286
basically it was just,

21:14.818 --> 21:22.286
I can't pin it down to any one thing. I just think 
there was a general awareness of the need of change

21:23.247 --> 21:31.277
amongst the population really. Now what caused 
it, I don't know. You can say it was the man up there

21:33.900 --> 21:36.242
or anything. I don't know what it was. I

21:39.845 --> 21:51.821
do know that something was guiding me because I was 
going where I had not planned to go at all. So

21:54.405 --> 21:58.510
whether it was the man up there or what, I really 
don't know. Because my schedule had not called for

21:59.712 --> 22:06.561
me to be active in trade union work.

22:10.658 --> 22:37.898
my sole interest in getting involved in it in Port 
Arthur was to try to help to elevate the horrible

22:10.658 --> 22:37.898
conditions that did exist

22:10.658 --> 22:37.898
and of course when I got to New York to continue to 
work to eliminate those horrible conditions

22:10.658 --> 22:37.898
and getting affiliated with the then, I guess you 
would call it, rebel group. It was clear to me that

22:47.846 --> 22:55.598
if there was going to be any success in the trade 
union movement, it would have to be through the

22:47.846 --> 22:55.598
rebel group. It was not coming from the corrupt, 
what I considered.

23:03.672 --> 23:04.493
Then

23:06.734 --> 23:17.225
I guess I shouldn't use the word corrupt because I 
can't prove that any of these people took money

23:06.734 --> 23:17.225
from anyone.

23:20.749 --> 23:34.243
I guess I had better simply say that to me they did 
not display a

23:20.749 --> 23:34.243
concern for the people that they were elected to 
represent.

23:37.396 --> 23:42.984
Why didn't your union, the ARTA, ever try to 
affiliate with the AFL? We did. We did try to

23:45.207 --> 23:48.331
affiliate, and they would not let us affiliate. 
They insisted that we had to become part of the...

23:48.391 --> 23:57.423
Oh, what was the name of it? Communication 
workers.

24:06.893 --> 24:08.775
I can't think of the name of the union. Again, I 
think there, I'm not sure that the union is still in

24:08.936 --> 24:25.516
existence, but you would have to get the name of it 
from

24:08.936 --> 24:25.516
the AFL-CIO. I just don't remember the name of the 
old communication workers. It's not the, not the

24:29.461 --> 24:34.447
communication workers of America. It's the old 
union that was affiliated with the AFL-CIO. The

24:38.798 --> 24:42.462
communication workers of America came through 
the CIO. So the AFL didn't want a maritime-based

24:43.263 --> 24:47.509
radio operators union. They wanted to be 
affiliated with a land-based. They insisted on

24:50.112 --> 24:55.960
that because that union had the charter for 
communication workers. So they felt there'd be a

24:55.980 --> 24:58.623
jurisdictional boundary? Oh, that union 
insisted that the AFLs not give a charter to us.

25:06.665 --> 25:11.353
Retrogressing a bit back to the Marine Workers 
Industrial Union. Right. Why do you think it

25:13.957 --> 25:24.335
failed and the old ISU continued to survive from 34 
on?

25:24.355 --> 25:28.842
Basically, I think it failed because of its

25:33.918 --> 25:35.240
communist affiliation. I think that's the basic 
reason because basically,

25:35.500 --> 25:52.144
well basically Americans were not oriented 
towards dictatorships.

25:54.487 --> 26:02.018
While the communists at that time of course 
preached that it was a dictatorship of the

25:54.487 --> 26:02.018
proletariat, Anyone with very much sense had to 
soon learn that it was not a dictatorship of the

26:03.871 --> 26:15.346
proletariat, it was a dictatorship of the 
Communist Party. And that the Communist Party, no

26:16.608 --> 26:31.988
totalitarian

26:16.608 --> 26:31.988
government can exist without having control over 
the workers. Workers have to be slaves to the party

26:33.436 --> 26:38.123
in control or they can't maintain it. And of 
course, the building of their armies and their

26:39.585 --> 26:49.959
power to maintain that control is power to control 
the working force. That's basically the only way

26:50.139 --> 26:56.288
that they can stay in existence.

26:59.609 --> 27:13.728
Moving back to the time when the California 
returned to New York after the strike in Pedro,

26:59.609 --> 27:13.728
who began to support the rebel faction besides 
your union? Basically the Communists really were

27:14.550 --> 27:21.419
the only outward support there was. There was 
plenty of liberal support, liberals in the New

27:22.460 --> 27:29.430
York area, As a matter of fact, a lot of money was 
raised as a result of liberal help, people not

27:30.811 --> 27:50.237
affiliated with the communists who were liberals 
and recognized the need for changing the

27:30.811 --> 27:50.237
conditions which exist. For example, I can 
remember a wife of one of the presidents of one of

27:57.878 --> 28:09.373
the steamship companies giving a very large sum of 
money to this movement at that time to help the

27:57.878 --> 28:09.373
seamen.

28:09.393 --> 28:18.025
And that was typical, you know, amongst a lot of 
fairly well-to-do liberal people who wanted to

28:09.393 --> 28:18.025
help.

28:23.032 --> 28:27.177
But I really think that the Communists were not 
successful because

28:31.882 --> 28:44.674
The people recognized that their allegiance was 
to the Communist Party, and the Communist Party

28:31.882 --> 28:44.674
was, at that time, the Communist Party of Russia. 
Everything flowed back there. The orders came

28:46.856 --> 28:52.521
down from there, and the orders went back there. 
And I know that as far as Joe and I were concerned,

28:52.541 --> 28:59.307
Joe Curran, We recognized that the Communists 
were only interested in building the unions for

29:00.417 --> 29:11.772
the purpose of building a power base for 
themselves. They were really not interested in

29:12.893 --> 29:19.862
improving the conditions except for that 
purpose, to build a power base. How early do you

29:20.383 --> 29:24.068
think Curran was aware of this, or became aware of 
this? I would say from the first. From the moment he

29:26.771 --> 29:28.213
arrived in New York? or even earlier than that? 
Well, I know that he and I started discussing this

29:33.046 --> 29:43.037
when immediately we got

29:33.046 --> 29:43.037
acquainted with each other. When was the first 
time that you met Joe Curran? I think the first time

29:46.641 --> 29:52.828
I met Joe Curran was in an apartment, in his 
apartment, in New York. I think it was on 23rd,

29:52.989 --> 29:57.434
pardon me, 23rd Street. I went to a meeting there 
that I was invited to. I guess there were five or six

30:02.770 --> 30:06.914
of us in that meeting. And I think that's the first 
time I met Joe, I'm not sure. Before or after the

30:10.158 --> 30:12.841
California incident? Well this was after. I 
didn't know Joe. You didn't know him before? No.

30:18.447 --> 30:27.056
This was after the California came back to New York 
and of course they were all dumped on the street and

30:18.447 --> 30:27.056
they started striking the ships. And the men 
started piling off the ships.

30:32.977 --> 30:41.530
The seamen needed someone to give them 
leadership, and Joe started providing that

30:32.977 --> 30:41.530
leadership. Did Joe actively seek out this 
position as leader, or did it just happen that way?

30:51.004 --> 30:53.568
It happened with Joe the same way it happened with 
me. He had no idea of becoming an active president

30:55.511 --> 31:00.739
of a union. This was the farthest from his 
thoughts. All he wanted to do was to be a good member

31:05.183 --> 31:12.091
of Reunion and follow his calling as a seaman. So 
you felt then, in 36, he just wanted to help reform

31:14.134 --> 31:24.167
the ISU and then go back to sea? No. I think once that 
he got in the leadership position that he wanted to

31:31.955 --> 31:35.258
go back to sea. I think that he wanted to stay in that 
position, that he wanted to continue that.

31:43.727 --> 31:45.709
I didn't want to go back to sea to begin with. I had 
no, two years was all I wanted to spend at sea,

31:45.909 --> 31:52.736
except as a first-class passenger.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.042
The life of a seaman did not fit my personality at 
all. It's too restrictive. You're a prisoner

32:09.177 --> 32:13.201
aboard that ship all the time you're at sea. You 
have no,

32:14.242 --> 32:28.135
can't think of the right word, you have no 
intercourse with the political economic and

32:28.874 --> 32:32.078
social life of the nation.

32:36.884 --> 32:55.388
You

32:36.884 --> 32:55.388
see the same people at breakfast, dinner, and 
supper, and any recreation that you can

32:56.819 --> 32:58.862
get started are with the same people.

33:01.585 --> 33:19.809
And if there happen to be people on that ship who are 
not socially inclined, or what I would call for

33:01.585 --> 33:19.809
simplification, troublemakers, you have to see 
them every day in and out. You cannot pick your

33:19.829 --> 33:21.491
friends. Your friends are picked for you. And it is 
just not a

33:25.135 --> 33:32.587
life that fits my personality.

33:35.332 --> 33:50.417
There's a lot to be said for going to sea for someone 
who wants to

33:35.332 --> 33:50.417
spend a lot of time reading and educating himself, 
and I took advantage of that while I was at sea. I

33:51.460 --> 33:57.809
found that that was the best outlet for me because I 
was not a gambler. I did not play cards. I did not

33:59.712 --> 34:00.753
drink. And playing cards or checkers or something 
like that was about the only recreation at that

34:02.295 --> 34:14.332
time that existed on the ship.

34:14.352 --> 34:19.459
But it is a good place to get yourself some 
self-education. And goodness knows I needed

34:20.333 --> 34:22.395
plenty of it. And I did take advantage of it. I 
continued my mathematics. It so happens that I was

34:29.881 --> 34:38.449
particularly good in mathematics when I got into 
high school. And that's one of the things that I did

34:40.210 --> 34:43.813
continue. Incidentally, we were graded at that 
time from 1 to 100, you know. And in plane geometry,

34:51.923 --> 35:03.837
I believe it was plane geometry, I'm sure it was, we 
had a teacher. And she gave us all a problem and

35:03.857 --> 35:17.172
said, now that anyone who can work that problem, I 
will give seven points extra on their report card.

35:18.569 --> 35:28.381
Well, I had been getting 99 on my report card all 
along, so

35:18.569 --> 35:28.381
I wanted to see what happened. So I worked the 
problem and brought it in, and I got the usual 99. So

35:35.650 --> 35:47.665
I went to her and she said, well, Hoyt, you know that 
no one is perfect, and that's why I always give a 99

35:35.650 --> 35:47.665
to anyone who passes all the tests and does the work 
in class. as you have been doing it. So if I give 106,

35:50.393 --> 36:01.966
which you would be entitled to, that means you're 
better than perfect, and that isn't so. I said,

36:02.066 --> 36:07.031
well, that may not be so, but you promised me seven 
points, and I want them. And if I don't get them, I'm

36:07.091 --> 36:09.914
going to the principal. She said, well, I said, I 
understand your position. And I'm not going to

36:14.948 --> 36:18.732
give them to you, and you're perfectly free to go to 
the principal. So I went to the principal. The

36:19.793 --> 36:22.275
principal ordered her to give me the seven points.

36:25.478 --> 36:28.301
Stupid, but that's the way it happened anyway. But 
I was particularly interested in that, and I did

36:29.502 --> 36:33.185
continue on it. And I was not good in history in 
school simply because I didn't understand the

36:34.066 --> 36:42.154
importance of it. But when I got to C, I did 
understand the importance of it, and I started

36:43.349 --> 36:49.958
studying history. Another subject I was not good 
in in school was English. Here again, I did not

36:56.045 --> 37:08.401
understand the importance of learning all of the 
technique involved in English, for example.

37:08.421 --> 37:10.504
Not having understood it, I wasn't good in it. 
That's one of the things I did learn in the little

37:12.003 --> 37:28.240
time in high school I was there, was to be good in any 
subject you have to understand the reason for

37:12.003 --> 37:28.240
being good in it, the importance of it. And this 
mathematics teacher that I had, and also the head

37:31.043 --> 37:39.512
of mathematics in that school, used the students 
who were particularly good in it to help other

37:40.032 --> 37:45.259
students. And I learned right away that it was a 
very simple approach to the situation. You had to

37:53.289 --> 38:05.024
learn the basics of all these subjects in order to 
understand the importance of them, or to even work

37:53.289 --> 38:05.024
the problems. For example, in algebra, as you 
know, there are certain basic rules that you must

38:09.631 --> 38:12.214
learn. These are facts which you learn as a basis of 
solving the problem. The same thing goes on all

38:18.500 --> 38:33.075
through any part of mathematics starting with 
addition, subtraction, division,

38:18.500 --> 38:33.075
multiplication, all of them, all the way up. And 
basically all that I had to do was to get the people

38:38.673 --> 38:45.164
that were assigned to me to help to go back and 
memorize those things you had to memorize. And

38:47.007 --> 38:52.175
that's another thing that I wish I had done in 
school was realize the importance of memory. And I

38:52.857 --> 38:57.424
didn't realize the importance of memory until I 
got into high school, really. The result has been

38:59.688 --> 39:05.237
that my memory has always been bad and still is.

39:07.816 --> 39:23.453
Going back to 36 and shortly after the California 
dock, who do you think was responsible for

39:07.816 --> 39:23.453
grooming Joe Kern, turning him in from an A.B. to a 
union leader, as far as speaking abilities? I

39:29.579 --> 39:31.321
think the Communist Party was. Any persons in 
particular that you... Well, I remember Roy

39:35.305 --> 39:40.593
Hudson, who was very active during all of this. At 
that time, he was the head man in the Marine end of

39:40.693 --> 39:47.584
the Communist Party. He was head of the Marine 
Workers Industrial Union, and I guess that made

39:47.604 --> 39:53.273
him the head. I don't know whether he became head of 
Marine Workers Industrial Union because he was a

39:53.793 --> 40:01.385
communist, or whether he became a communist 
because he was there. I don't know what happened.

40:03.487 --> 40:14.703
But he was at the time the head man, and of course he 
was interested in trying to build the strength of

40:03.487 --> 40:14.703
the Communist Party in the marine industry. In 
your opinion, did the Communists seek out Joe

40:14.723 --> 40:19.270
Curran or vice versa? They sought out Joe Curran. 
Just like they sought out me when they learned that

40:22.634 --> 40:28.302
I was in New York. They sought me out and tried to 
influence me on everything that I did. And they

40:33.508 --> 40:38.233
tried to influence Joe on everything that he did. 
And it was up to Joe and it was up to me to listen to

40:39.134 --> 40:51.586
their pitch and make a decision as to what part of it 
you could use and what part of it you couldn't use.

40:52.908 --> 40:57.152
When these rebels went out on strike, did you have 
your union members obey their picket lines? This

40:59.872 --> 41:01.555
is in the spring strike of 36. I

41:01.735 --> 41:08.607
don't think we did. I think they told us to stay 
aboard the ships. I think this is a decision we made

41:11.912 --> 41:18.063
for the radio operators to stay aboard the ship. 
And not actively participate in the strike or

41:18.083 --> 41:21.849
actively back? That's right. In other words, if 
the ship And

41:24.689 --> 41:30.835
if the ship sailed, we were to sail with it. This 
way, we always had communication. Communication

41:33.178 --> 41:37.482
was as important then as it is now. And I'm sure that 
that was what we decided to do, although I don't

41:38.823 --> 41:53.278
remember the details or the discussions and so 
forth that led up to this, because we actually went

41:38.823 --> 41:53.278
off the ships with the seamen to begin with. and 
then decided that this was the wrong tactic for the

41:54.288 --> 42:09.504
radio operator, that one man was not going to 
contribute anything to the ship, to being ashore

41:54.288 --> 42:09.504
if the ship was going to sail. That man was more 
important aboard the ship, and it turned out that

42:10.425 --> 42:18.253
we were the most important man aboard the ship as 
far as the strike was concerned. So then your union

42:20.039 --> 42:24.807
members kind of passively supported Kieran and 
his followers? We don't more than passively

42:24.888 --> 42:27.352
supported it. We were, we supported him with 
finances. I assigned our vice president to the, to

42:31.379 --> 42:37.009
the group full-time. That's all he did. And do you 
remember this gentleman's name? Yeah, his name

42:40.315 --> 42:44.562
was Roy Pyle.

42:46.516 --> 42:50.541
Why do you think that the spring strike of 36 
failed? Or do you think it failed? I don't think it

42:54.145 --> 42:55.146
failed. No, I don't think at all it failed. It built 
up the understanding of the need for strong union

43:00.753 --> 43:14.970
in the industry,

43:00.753 --> 43:14.970
made everyone aware of what the conditions were. 
and made the seamen aware that if those conditions

43:15.929 --> 43:26.243
were ever going to be changed, there had to be a 
union, which they controlled, the seamen

43:15.929 --> 43:26.243
themselves. How did the Kieran's group get such a 
large media following? Well, the media is always

43:36.017 --> 43:42.426
interested in any news that there is. And there 
were a lot of liberals associated with the

43:43.283 --> 43:47.989
newspapers. Haywood Broon, did he support you at 
this time? He surely did. Do you think he might have

43:54.558 --> 44:02.949
been able to give Seaman more newspaper space than 
they might have under, say, another personality?

44:02.969 --> 44:07.435
No, Haywood Broon really didn't give the Seaman 
any newspaper space any more than he would give

44:08.022 --> 44:12.247
anyone else. He wrote some stuff about the 
situation when it was appropriate for him to do so,

44:12.287 --> 44:21.918
but he really didn't change his style in any way.

44:24.782 --> 44:32.190
Haywood Bruin...

44:24.782 --> 44:32.190
Did he ever meet with Karen or anything? Oh yes, 
yes. He met with every leader of every union in the

44:37.486 --> 44:38.607
trade union movement. And he would give his 
personal help wherever he could. So he advised

44:48.000 --> 44:49.361
Karen at times? No, I don't think he ever advised 
anyone. I don't think he had that. His role was

44:56.010 --> 44:58.053
advising. His role was speaking to the people, to 
the mass group. One of my jobs was to keep Haywood

45:07.304 --> 45:21.283
Bruin in a condition so he could speak to the 
people, to stay with him when he was invited to

45:07.304 --> 45:21.283
speak at meetings, not just of Seaman, but of other 
trade unions. This was true with the transport

45:21.364 --> 45:25.009
workers in New York. It was true of the ILGWU in New 
York. He spoke at practically every meeting that

45:31.978 --> 45:36.805
there was in New York. He made himself available to 
speak at these meetings. And

45:43.320 --> 45:54.287
I would say about at least 75% of the time, one of the 
things that I had to do really was...
