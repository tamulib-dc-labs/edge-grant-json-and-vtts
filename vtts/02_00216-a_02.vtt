WEBVTT

00:01.364 --> 00:05.409
know that I was leaving him there because he was 
going through. I left him alongside the road. I

00:08.013 --> 00:15.502
pulled him into a nice parking area where he 
wouldn't get run over by somebody, but as far as I

00:08.013 --> 00:15.502
know, he may not have ever made it to Sonora. But had 
several good experiences. In fact, I've had

00:20.429 --> 00:29.380
people go out of their way as far as 30 or 40 miles to 
take you further along to where you could pick up a

00:20.429 --> 00:29.380
ride or get you closer to home. If somebody was 
going through there, going to Junction, or wasn't

00:31.453 --> 00:40.626
going to Junction, they'd be going to someplace 
like Menard. It was only 30 miles away. I was

00:41.908 --> 00:42.969
running you over there. And we'll do that. It'll be 
a very nice fun day. I have not yet had anybody share

00:46.675 --> 00:54.085
a truly bad Aggie hitchhiking experience. In 
other words, a number like you, they were drinking

00:54.402 --> 01:00.849
too much, driving too fast, but nothing worse than 
that. No, I never had a real bad experience, not

01:00.869 --> 01:09.919
having any sort of a threatening problem with 
anyone. Describe, after being in the service for

01:10.180 --> 01:17.107
those years, describe having to buckle down to 
study. What was it like that first fall? Scared to

01:19.550 --> 01:21.572
death. First place, nearly all of us, had been out 
of school or had never either been to school or had

01:24.355 --> 01:29.922
been out for a long time. But most of the ones that I 
all knew, none of them had ever been to college

01:29.942 --> 01:34.767
before. They'd been out. They knew that they were 
behind in terms of their peer groups. These kids

01:40.854 --> 01:47.743
that they'd graduated from high school with and 
went on to college were already juniors or seniors

01:40.854 --> 01:47.743
or maybe some of them already out of school. So we 
were older, although I was still not all that old at

01:52.942 --> 01:58.047
that time, but it was very serious. You studied and 
we were not really greatly appreciated by the rest

01:58.107 --> 02:09.418
of the student body because we raised the curve. We 
did make much better grades. And really the first

02:13.963 --> 02:19.168
year I was here, Of course, everybody here was 
Corps. They really didn't know what to do with us.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.887
They didn't know how to treat us. Here we were, we'd 
been in the military, had been in service, and most

02:27.269 --> 02:45.356
of us had been in combat before, and they were just 
trying to get in it, and they had their own sets of

02:27.269 --> 02:45.356
rules and protocols and the systems that they had 
grown up with or had developed here. So we were sort

02:46.137 --> 02:48.801
of an anomaly for them. for the rest of the student 
body, particularly the upperclassmen. Did any of

02:52.844 --> 03:03.417
the Corps come out there the first fall to try to 
teach y'all Aggie myths and legends and all that?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.439
They did originally. They didn't last very long. 
They didn't do it. They found out that we were not

03:10.645 --> 03:16.392
really, as a group, all that interested in raw, raw 
part of going to school, of the university life,

03:17.249 --> 03:27.406
that we were primarily interested in getting our 
studies done, getting our grades done, getting,

03:17.249 --> 03:27.406
progressing on through and getting out. Alright, 
did y'all come into football games? Yeah.

03:31.072 --> 03:35.680
Describe your first, if you remember, what it was 
like to go to an Aggie football game that fall. One

03:36.140 --> 03:43.813
thing they did do, they convinced me that A&M was 
invisible, invincible in football, and I was

03:36.140 --> 03:43.813
greatly shocked to find out how Badly, I was 
misled. I think in my four years at A&M, we won a

03:49.372 --> 03:54.422
total of eight ballgames. But every weekend, 
every week, we was darn sure we were going to be here

03:56.105 --> 04:04.741
when we were playing that week. You know, one of the 
things Bernie Welch told me that helps explain

04:06.003 --> 04:09.109
that, and he very very proud and grateful to coach 
norton he said coach norton promised every single

04:10.473 --> 04:25.292
person that had played for him if you serve on 
active duty you have a scholarship And he said,

04:25.593 --> 04:32.802
when we came back, we weren't nearly as good 
athletes and we weren't ready to concentrate on

04:25.593 --> 04:32.802
that. We had, you know, we were more serious now. 
But he honored that commitment and he said, as a

04:35.105 --> 04:39.891
result, we didn't win many games and he lost his 
job. Yeah. Well, I saw Barney Wells score the first

04:41.092 --> 04:46.379
touchdown at the University of Texas. We went to 
that game every year as well. Even when they played

04:49.262 --> 04:52.707
it in San Antonio. So that... Now, when y'all went 
to the game, did you sit as a group, you veterans?

04:59.342 --> 05:02.827
Generally did, because we all had tickets in the 
same general. Did y'all stand up like all the other

05:03.208 --> 05:05.671
students? Oh, yeah. Okay, so you did. And did the 
L's. Did the L's, yeah. They taught us that. But you

05:11.860 --> 05:20.091
would have been the only civilian freshman and 
sophomore students, wouldn't you? In other

05:20.111 --> 05:22.034
words, the only ones not in uniform. Not in 
uniform. They had a few what they called day

05:23.204 --> 05:32.116
dodgers that were in the regular corps but did not 
participate in anything but the drills. As far as

05:32.136 --> 05:38.104
you can recall, who was running the vet outfit? Who 
was in charge, do you know? On

05:41.589 --> 05:49.279
site control, I really don't remember. As I 
recall, Tom Harrington had as much to do with it as

05:50.187 --> 05:59.081
anyone, but he wasn't out there all the time. Of 
course, he was in here most of the time. Did you have

06:02.045 --> 06:07.013
anybody that you as an individual turned to for 
advice out there? How did you know what courses to

06:08.094 --> 06:09.597
take?

06:12.962 --> 06:13.883
That's a good question. you sort of had the catalog 
and decided what it was that you thought you needed

06:14.369 --> 06:21.520
and just sort of went in and signed up for those 
courses. There wasn't a whole lot of guidance in

06:21.540 --> 06:36.924
terms of curriculum in terms of for future until 
well we got we got in here on back in here on campus

06:21.540 --> 06:36.924
then the next year and then we got more involved. 
Did you have any social life in those days? I did.

06:41.652 --> 06:42.553
Dated

06:45.672 --> 06:49.681
A couple of girls that, of course, none of them 
local. Again, having to hitchhike to San Marcos to

06:49.761 --> 06:56.055
talk.

06:56.857 --> 06:57.118
T.W. and my wife, who I later married, was going to 
the University of Texas at the time. Now, when do

07:02.630 --> 07:03.833
you meet her? In the end of my junior year. Oh, so 
that's later. And

07:07.880 --> 07:16.248
then you go home, Thanksgiving, Christmas. 
Thanksgiving, Christmas. Do you remember giving

07:17.088 --> 07:22.053
your family or anybody there any description of 
what it was like? What were you telling them A&M

07:22.113 --> 07:24.074
was? Well, of course, I was real proud to be going to 
A&M, to go to any school, but particularly A&M, and

07:24.535 --> 07:34.123
we were Of course, we had a ranch and a farm, and my 
dad was always interested in the new developments

07:34.660 --> 07:51.483
in agriculture and the new types of grasses that we 
might grow that would do better in that darn rocky

07:34.660 --> 07:51.483
hill country than what we already had up there. Of 
course, what we really needed to do was take about

07:52.224 --> 07:58.412
half the stock off of it for a few years, but we 
didn't think we could afford to do that. But A&M was

07:59.454 --> 08:04.060
quite respected. in our rural part of the world. I 
don't know why I had not heard more about A&M before

08:09.124 --> 08:15.954
I went in to the Marine Corps. And you never thought 
about dropping out? No. So you're, all right, and

08:19.960 --> 08:27.031
you come back then the spring semester, things go 
well. Yeah. Did your grades both, the first two

08:27.913 --> 08:31.037
semesters, were those were good? Good grades. I 
made, uh, Well, we were on the three-point system

08:33.908 --> 08:41.316
then, so I was about a 2.7 and doing well. And did you 
zero in on economics in the spring? No, I didn't do

08:45.061 --> 08:56.414
that until I got back in on campus, and then I 
decided that, in fact, it was ag economics that I

08:45.061 --> 08:56.414
went into and never regretted doing it. It was a 
very broad-based course, curriculum, and gave

08:56.514 --> 09:02.160
you a lot of insight into it. a whole bunch of things 
that I don't think I would have gotten. I got very

09:06.171 --> 09:10.434
interested in things like geology and just 
fascinating. Paleontology, I wish I could be a

09:10.975 --> 09:14.057
paleontologist. That would be great. I don't 
think I could make a living doing that. All right,

09:18.041 --> 09:22.004
so you're out there all year, and then you go home 
for the summer? I went home for the summer, worked

09:22.024 --> 09:24.466
in the summer, every summer. Doing what? Well, I 
either worked the first summer, I worked on our

09:25.727 --> 09:32.333
range and various ranges. And then on the second 
one, the second summer, and the third, let's see,

09:33.781 --> 09:43.913
the second summer, I worked for Exxon, or Umbalo at 
that time. They had, at that time, all of their

09:43.933 --> 10:03.737
pipeline operations were staffed at service 
points, and I was, I spent the summer out between

09:43.933 --> 10:03.737
Sonora and El Dorado at what they called Station A, 
where they had a, you lived out there, they had a

09:43.933 --> 10:03.737
crew, a five-person crew with enough people to be 
sure there was 24-hour coverage on everything.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.145
And good experience. They had one provision I 
thought was real odd in their requirement. They'd

10:14.570 --> 10:24.382
be happy to hire anybody going to school that they 
could place, but you had to agree that you would not

10:14.570 --> 10:24.382
come back as a full employee. That this was, you 
were purely a temporary employee for the summer.

10:29.553 --> 10:32.396
And when the summer was over, you had to go back to 
school. And you had to agree to do that before

10:33.157 --> 10:36.922
they'd hire you. All right, so you came back here 
then your sophomore year. Yeah. And on the campus,

10:42.768 --> 10:44.430
main campus? On the main campus, up on the dorm next 
to the dormitory. All right, describe that

10:48.695 --> 10:51.438
routine for an old veteran. An old veteran, again, 
that's where we really got most of our interface

10:51.538 --> 10:57.265
with the existing student body. because now we 
were in with them all the time. And while there was

11:00.705 --> 11:09.774
some getting used to of each other, it never 
really, as far as I could tell, there was never any

11:00.705 --> 11:09.774
real problem with it. I think probably, let's get 
another up to the next year, when it joined the

11:10.815 --> 11:19.144
Corps the next year, and we had our own outfit. We 
had our own,

11:19.184 --> 11:27.252
what do they call it, the wing. with their own 
structure in it. There was a little friction then

11:30.548 --> 11:53.513
between the younger members of our group, the 
sophomores and freshmen that had come in to the

11:30.548 --> 11:53.513
Corps there, and the regular seniors and juniors 
in the regular Corps, because we didn't think we

11:30.548 --> 11:53.513
needed to snap two every time we saw one of them and 
that sort of thing. But that got worked out. That

11:54.774 --> 11:57.677
got worked out pretty well. Wait, still on that 
second year, your sophomore year,

11:59.429 --> 12:10.559
was there a good retention rate of those who had 
been freshmen out at Bryan Field? Not as good as I

12:11.480 --> 12:29.217
would have thought there would have been, because 
for several reasons, I think, and not just because

12:11.480 --> 12:29.217
of grades, although we did have a few that just were 
not capable of doing the work. did not make it past

12:29.585 --> 12:31.388
that first year. But we also had those that figured 
they were already too far behind. They needed to

12:36.916 --> 12:38.698
get married and settle down. Some of them, you 
know, up in their mid-20s that decided it was time

12:39.019 --> 12:48.753
to go out and try to earn a living and support their 
wife and get married and have a family. So we lost a

12:48.833 --> 12:50.996
few that way. But I'd say the losses were not as 
great as they were in the regular population of the

12:58.660 --> 13:00.823
school. Looking back on that year, was that, given 
the realities they had to deal with, was that a good

13:01.564 --> 13:10.518
solution to the situation? Had lots of veterans, 
couldn't build the housing that quickly?

13:18.129 --> 13:22.115
I don't think, I think they did the best thing they 
could do. I think that the Bryan Air Force Base,

13:22.135 --> 13:27.283
while we bitched about it, and moving out there,

13:31.567 --> 13:35.532
was better than most of us had come from. I'd lived 
in a pup tent for a whole lot of months that were a

13:37.073 --> 13:43.321
whole lot worse than that. And while it was not as 
what I was looking forward to, it was not bad at all.

13:48.367 --> 13:49.268
It really wasn't bad. All right. Now, then here on 
the campus, your sophomore year, you lived where?

13:56.817 --> 13:57.898
I think at dorm 17. And I had a brother. by the way, at 
that time, who had come out of the, he had been on the

14:00.001 --> 14:06.127
Signal Corps, Pat, I don't know if you remember 
Pat. He was head of the Real Estate Research

14:06.147 --> 14:07.768
Center. Oh, yes. And he and I shared a room one year, 
that sophomore year. And you were still referred

14:13.534 --> 14:17.137
to as vets. Yep. And you wore civilian clothes to 
class. Right. What was, what did a typical

14:20.961 --> 14:24.885
undergraduate male wear then? What were, what was 
normal Aggie clothing? Blue jeans. or khaki pants

14:29.954 --> 14:35.801
and a sports shirt of some type. Those of us who came 
from out in rural countries generally had a denim

14:36.983 --> 14:47.436
jacket that we wore. What kind of foot gear? Boots. 
Not cowboy boots, though? Yeah. Oh, they were?

14:54.613 --> 14:55.154
Yeah. I was going to get work boots. Well, we also 
had those, the cowboy boots, too, because most of

14:56.515 --> 15:04.424
you out there grew up with cowboy boots on the 
high-top boots. Did you wear a hat at all during the

15:04.444 --> 15:06.787
day? I would have never really been a big hat 
wearer. Most people did wear hats, but I did not

15:10.231 --> 15:16.518
wear a hat. How was the routine in the classroom 
here compared to what it had been out there at Bryan

15:16.538 --> 15:23.265
Field? Of course it was a little easier to get to 
classes here because you knew where things were.

15:29.126 --> 15:39.098
The professors here were more oriented

15:29.126 --> 15:39.098
at what they were doing and the way they were doing 
it here. So they were probably less flexibility in

15:39.719 --> 15:48.850
dealing with the student population that they had 
than we had out there. But overall,

15:53.722 --> 15:59.729
I think it, I think we transformed pretty well into 
the general student body here. We became, we were

15:59.809 --> 16:10.642
not considered to be a big anomaly as far as the 
student body was concerned. We were vets, they

16:10.662 --> 16:20.674
still complained about, we were running the 
curves on all the classes and that sort of thing,

16:10.662 --> 16:20.674
but But not in a bitter way. Now, did a freshman whip 
out to you vets? He would when

16:29.637 --> 16:35.746
we were in the Corps. No, but when you were a 
sophomore, did anybody expect y'all to go to Yale

16:35.866 --> 16:45.840
practice that sophomore year? No, you went to 
the... silver taps and things like that, but you

16:48.160 --> 16:56.493
could go to Yale practice if you wanted to, but it 
wasn't a requirement. Silver taps was not held out

16:56.513 --> 16:59.217
at Bryan Field, or was it? No. So here. Do you 
remember your impression of silver taps when you

17:00.238 --> 17:04.024
first? Very impressed with it, and still am. I 
still, that just sends cold chills down my back

17:06.768 --> 17:13.138
every time I hear that. Do you think it was more 
meaningful to you and your fellow veterans than it

17:13.793 --> 17:22.341
would have been to the non-veterans? I think so. I 
think it was. We'd heard it for real a lot of times.

17:30.349 --> 17:32.771
It was always a very impressive thing. Okay, now I 
want to really hope you have some thoughts about

17:32.791 --> 17:38.356
Bonfire. This would have been the fall of 47. 
describe Bonfire that year, as far as you

17:41.873 --> 17:46.879
remember, your first year on campus? I'm not sure 
whether it was that year or the next year that we got

17:48.921 --> 17:56.349
it bombed. Do you remember that? I've heard about 
it. But it was on the, Bonfire was on the drill

17:58.171 --> 18:01.655
field. On the drill field. And it was nothing like 
the Bonfire now in structure. But it was all logs.

18:09.043 --> 18:09.544
All logs. And it was TPed up. Just like this. And 
about how long did they work on it? Seemed to be like

18:17.282 --> 18:19.286
maybe two or three weeks. It was not the long period 
of time that they spend on it now. My grandson just

18:22.652 --> 18:24.916
graduated. They spent a lot of time cutting and 
hauling. So one of the things I haven't been able to

18:29.444 --> 18:32.890
get much information on yet is apparently before 
the war it was all just trash and clutter. And how

18:40.105 --> 18:43.169
did it suddenly become logs? I haven't found 
anybody with any know-how on that yet. I don't know

18:47.093 --> 18:47.813
how it changed. I think it was logs the first time 
that we were involved in it here. Oh, I think 46 even

18:52.138 --> 18:55.101
it may have been logs. Do you remember whether 
y'all came in for bonfire or not from out at the

18:55.582 --> 18:59.446
base? Yeah, we did. It was logs? I think it was logs, 
the best I can recall. And I know it was when I was in

19:04.308 --> 19:19.450
here about 47 and 48, because then we were, even 
though that's when I was in the Corps, and we were

19:04.308 --> 19:19.450
guarding it, and we were guarding the bonfire. You 
know, they're hard enough to set a fire with all

19:20.351 --> 19:27.481
that diesel fuel on them, but we guarded it, and we 
had it bombed one year. Yeah, describe that. I

19:30.045 --> 19:33.049
wasn't out there at the time, but... Two kids from 
UT flew over in a small airplane and dropped some,

19:33.282 --> 19:47.739
what do you call it, Molotov cocktail things, a 
gallon jug of gasoline with a wick in it. And they

19:49.000 --> 20:02.496
were so enthralled in dropping that on the stack of 
logs that we had up there that they grounded right

19:49.000 --> 20:02.496
out on the other side of the airport out there. But 
it caused great excitement. Oh, everybody

20:04.676 --> 20:08.480
couldn't believe, you know, that they were trying 
to burn our bonfire. Did you guys, did any Aggie

20:08.960 --> 20:14.705
students get to them after they grounded? I don't 
think so. I don't think we even knew that they had

20:15.867 --> 20:18.749
grounded until way after that. I think they... 
Were they able to take it off and then... Well, I

20:20.431 --> 20:25.476
think what they were doing, they weren't paying 
attention. They were looking back to see if they

20:25.496 --> 20:30.140
really set it afire and just almost flew it into the 
ground. And it didn't kill either one of them, no.

20:32.800 --> 20:37.526
Of course, I know it didn't hurt anyone, but it was a 
good story in a way. All right. Here on the campus

20:39.109 --> 20:47.760
now, as a non-core member sophomore, what was your 
routine for a typical class day? Generally up and

20:48.701 --> 20:53.648
have breakfast early. I always try to schedule 
early classes. And then I had to study during the

20:56.652 --> 21:01.018
day, too. Where did you study? Studying primarily 
in my room. Again,

21:06.560 --> 21:17.420
in the sophomore year we were over there and nearly 
all the veterans in that area over there and

21:06.560 --> 21:17.420
everybody sort of followed the same procedure. 
You studied when you got a chance to during the day.

21:23.054 --> 21:37.251
Then we probably had a little more nightlife then 
than we had out there because it was a little easier

21:23.054 --> 21:37.251
to get together and go out to someplace and have a 
cold beverage. Was there much going on at

21:37.271 --> 21:40.535
Northgate in those nights then? Not nearly like it 
is now. Northgate was sort of, in fact, Northgate

21:42.518 --> 21:48.285
was pretty trashy at that time. Was the movie 
theater even there? Yeah, the movie theater was

21:51.053 --> 21:52.455
there. And

21:53.416 --> 22:03.569
the photo outfit was there. Then you go to Gine 
Hall. Yeah, at Gine Hall. At that time, the name of

22:09.536 --> 22:16.585
the building where they had the board's quarters, 
And

22:17.442 --> 22:32.983
you ate in Sabeasa.

22:36.127 --> 22:37.729
What was your impression of Aggie food? Good. Now I 
thought our food at A&M was Did you veterans pick up

22:45.370 --> 22:49.135
Aggie slang for food and all that? Yeah, we finally 
did, yeah. You finally had to if you were eating a

22:52.820 --> 22:57.206
mess all morning. And I'm assuming that y'all 
didn't have any pranks in your dorm. Not much, not

23:03.254 --> 23:04.836
much. Not like they had over, of course, the jocks, 
the cavalry groups over there, they always had

23:06.118 --> 23:13.588
something going on. But in our dorms, it was pretty 
quiet. They didn't have just a whole lot of... No,

23:18.223 --> 23:21.487
it was an all-civilian dorm. Yeah. By that time, 
who were the, as far as you were aware, who were the

23:25.111 --> 23:30.857
key campus administrators? Who was running 
things? Jim Gilchrist was the chancellor.

23:34.961 --> 23:37.444
President and then chancellor. Of course, the 
class of 46, I mean, the class of 50 was such a big

23:37.464 --> 23:42.630
class. Let's say the biggest one we'd ever had for 
some ten years after that was still the biggest

23:42.847 --> 23:49.095
class they'd had here. But I can't really remember 
what the rules were that had come down that a number

23:50.056 --> 24:02.492
of the Corps leadership had objected to, and they 
had a march on Mr. Gilchrist's house. Did you, by

24:04.619 --> 24:06.744
chance, were you present to observe? I was not. 
Didn't even know what was going on until it was over

24:07.245 --> 24:09.690
with. But I then, of course, heard that they had it. 
As I understand it, it was, and he was telling them,

24:14.201 --> 24:20.756
no more hazing after Thanksgiving, period. 
That's it. That's probably what it was. And then

24:22.740 --> 24:28.387
they marched on his house and turned in their 
resignations, and he accepted their

24:22.740 --> 24:28.387
resignation. Shocked them. Yes, and as I 
understand it, he also told them that if we have any

24:30.229 --> 24:43.246
more hazing, then he would not sign for anybody a 
recommendation that they be commissioned. I

24:43.266 --> 24:46.390
think that was what was really the thing that 
brought them to it. Did you as an undergraduate see

24:46.891 --> 24:50.856
much of President Gilchrist? Not really. I got to 
know him quite well after I got back here, but I did

24:53.619 --> 24:58.764
not really see him. I saw Dr. Harrington more than I 
did Mr. Gilchrist. What was your impression of Dr.

25:01.907 --> 25:04.530
Harrington in those days? I thought he was a very 
impressive fellow, well-spoken, made a very good

25:04.690 --> 25:15.741
impression, handled himself very well. As far as 
his philosophy and politics and that sort of

25:16.642 --> 25:21.467
thing, I wasn't a very good judge, but I was quite 
impressed with him. Now you, and you, had you

25:25.136 --> 25:30.224
gotten into your major for sure by this time? 
Sophomore year. Sophomore year? Yeah. And it

25:32.508 --> 25:35.332
ended up being ag economics. Who did you turn to, 
who were the key people for you on the faculty in

25:35.933 --> 25:41.643
economics? Tyrus Tim, who became head of the 
department during that period. Did you have any

25:48.213 --> 25:49.495
courses with him? Yes, I did. Describe him as a 
teacher for us. He was a good teacher. He brought in

25:55.321 --> 26:10.438
a lot of external

25:55.321 --> 26:10.438
information that you did not normally get in a 
classroom because he'd come out with an extension

25:55.321 --> 26:10.438
background, as you probably know, had a good feel 
for the people that we were trying to deal with and

26:11.026 --> 26:15.552
help. Now, the head of the department at that time 
was Mr. L.P. Gabbard, a very fine gentleman. I knew

26:23.101 --> 26:35.056
him better as a graduate student, but he was also a 
very impressive fellow. Were there student

26:35.076 --> 26:40.463
nicknames for either of them, like there were for 
many other faculty? No. Not for either of them that

26:41.452 --> 26:43.634
I can recall. Who did you turn to for advice about 
your major? Primarily John McNeely. Do you

26:50.760 --> 26:52.361
remember John McNeely? Describe him. John was a 
good old South Dakota boy who swore if he ever went

26:53.843 --> 27:02.410
back to South Dakota, he wanted to have somebody 
put him in an institution somewhere. But he was a

27:03.811 --> 27:08.916
livestock marketing man. I worked with him for 
years. He was my major professor. And very, very

27:11.928 --> 27:25.706
considerate, a very effective teacher, I 
thought, and one that was well liked by the

27:11.928 --> 27:25.706
students that he taught. And I think well 
respected within the department and within his

27:26.687 --> 27:30.332
field. He had done a lot of research work, and he was 
my major professor in both my master's and Ph.D.

27:30.352 --> 27:40.905
programs. Can you remember any examples of very 
important advice that he gave you? Primarily,

27:47.507 --> 28:00.226
Haskell, John worked on the principle that 
progress was not necessarily made by the smartest

27:47.507 --> 28:00.226
people in the world. It was made by the people that 
worked hard and studied and kept trying to get it

28:00.326 --> 28:05.473
done. And if you had a problem, you got that problem 
resolved and moved on to the next one. I think that

28:10.602 --> 28:30.145
was about the most useful kind of direction and 
advice that I got from him, was that you're not

28:10.602 --> 28:30.145
always going to solve the problem the first time 
you run into it, but the time you work it over a few

28:10.602 --> 28:30.145
times, you've got a much better chance of moving 
forward with it. What did you think, sophomore,

28:30.165 --> 28:35.631
junior year or so, what did you think you were going 
to do professionally? I thought I might go into the

28:36.522 --> 28:42.508
academic world on the one hand. I'd had an 
opportunity to

28:42.909 --> 28:52.059
go manage a large ranch up in Virginia, of all 
places. I had a Roanoke, Virginia, a horse ranch

28:52.900 --> 29:00.828
that was very attractive to me until I thought 
about it again and again. But I decided that I would

29:00.848 --> 29:05.213
really like to get involved more in research. And 
of course, at that time, basically all economic

29:08.425 --> 29:18.681
research was really done in the ag-eco field. The 
new developments really came out of the ag-eco

29:19.682 --> 29:33.985
work, primarily, as opposed to the pure 
economics, who were primarily interested in

29:19.682 --> 29:33.985
theoretical economics as opposed to the 
problem-solving types of work. Were there any

29:34.893 --> 29:43.943
other faculty members that were in your 
undergraduate days that were key to your future as

29:34.893 --> 29:43.943
you now realize it? McNeely was probably the most 
key particular one. A

29:53.794 --> 30:04.225
fellow named Bob Halpin, H-A-L-P-I-N, who has 
been gone for several years. I'm sure he's dead,

30:04.610 --> 30:08.916
but now he moved off here probably 20 years ago. But 
he was also a very good mentor. He took time to work

30:14.664 --> 30:16.687
with students.

30:19.691 --> 30:22.896
If necessary, he'd do it at night. He'd invite you 
out to his house to work on a particular problem

30:22.916 --> 30:27.242
that you might have. He was also a very good 
influence, I think. on me but on others that were in

30:32.723 --> 30:36.628
the department. All right and now then as a junior 
You decided to be in the Corps. Saturday I was going

30:41.124 --> 30:42.426
to get a commission. Why? Oh, that was that 
commission. Yeah, I wanted the commission. That

30:46.251 --> 30:46.952
was the thing. Were your status in the Corps, you 
were academically a junior, what was your status

30:48.174 --> 30:54.162
in the Corps? Junior. You were junior, okay. 
Junior privileges, all of that sort of thing. So

30:58.948 --> 31:01.552
you didn't have to go through all that fish 
baloney. Were you then assigned to a unit? that had

31:05.039 --> 31:11.810
freshmen and sophomores and juniors and seniors 
that had been through the, were you veterans

31:05.039 --> 31:11.810
scattered out? No. We were all in the, the units 
were all veteran. Ah. So it was a vet unit. E-Vet was

31:18.580 --> 31:20.583
my company. And we had a vet wing.
