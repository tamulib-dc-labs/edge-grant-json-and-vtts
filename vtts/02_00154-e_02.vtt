WEBVTT

00:03.052 --> 00:08.877
...aimed specifically at the rice owls was 
simple. The head yell leaders ask,

00:11.440 --> 00:20.828
quote, what comes out of a Chinaman's eyes?

00:24.031 --> 00:25.632
Question mark, quote. And then the

00:26.894 --> 00:32.839
maroon student, the maroon section, Everyone 
sitting in the rune section yelled back, rise,

00:34.456 --> 00:43.169
rise, rise.

00:43.189 --> 01:00.514
Similarly,

00:43.189 --> 01:00.514
the tradition of a, quote, court trip,

00:43.189 --> 01:00.514
where all members of the Corps of Cadets

01:04.544 --> 01:19.477
went in alternate years to the Aggie football 
games in Houston or Austin

01:04.544 --> 01:19.477
and Dallas or Fort Worth.

01:24.082 --> 01:34.551
Hitchhiking, we're getting there by 
hitchhiking,

01:24.082 --> 01:34.551
riding the train or buses, crowding into 10 to 12 
youngsters

01:36.303 --> 02:05.871
into individual hotel rooms,

01:36.303 --> 02:05.871
sleeping on the floor at a friend's house, and or 
reaching their destination just as the march

01:36.303 --> 02:05.871
began for the whole corps

01:36.303 --> 02:05.871
headed down Main Street in Houston,

02:07.960 --> 02:25.155
Congress Avenue in Austin,

02:07.960 --> 02:25.155
are the main thoroughfires in Dallas and Fort 
Worth.

02:25.175 --> 02:37.326
In fact, I had literally prayed

02:25.175 --> 02:37.326
for God's help in finding

02:25.175 --> 02:37.326
a good faculty appointment

02:41.137 --> 02:42.899
But had asked. For his assistance. And not sending 
me. To either Baylor. Or.

03:02.645 --> 03:03.246
A&M

03:10.702 --> 03:12.825
Prince up paragraph part of that. Negative

03:12.865 --> 03:20.277
feeling. Began to disappear.

03:24.364 --> 03:26.888
What one of the major steps? And the 
disappearance. Of that negative feeling toward

03:29.492 --> 03:31.355
A&M.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.844
Came with the appointment.

03:40.182 --> 03:59.779
to

03:40.182 --> 03:59.779
the Aspirations Committee,

03:40.182 --> 03:59.779
a part of what was labeled the Century Study.

03:59.799 --> 04:10.088
That study was the

03:59.799 --> 04:10.088
climax of a plan

04:15.670 --> 04:39.690
instituted instigated by some key former 
students

04:15.670 --> 04:39.690
and others who yearn for A&M to become more of a pace 
setter in higher education first in the state and

04:15.670 --> 04:39.690
then possibly even at the national level.

04:42.813 --> 04:45.255
One of the first steps in that dream had been the 
recruitment of Earl Rudder as president. But now

04:53.003 --> 05:15.445
the idea was for

04:53.003 --> 05:15.445
some people, a large number of people, faculty, 
staff, former students and others, to begin to

04:53.003 --> 05:15.445
dream of what the Agricultural Mechanical 
College of Texas could become by the time of its

05:16.083 --> 05:21.810
centennial anniversary in 1976. I

05:21.970 --> 05:40.774
was appointed to the Aspirations Committee, 
particularly to the segment of that group to look

05:21.970 --> 05:40.774
at Resident Instruction and Student Life, RISL.

05:49.833 --> 06:17.545
In hindsight,

05:49.833 --> 06:17.545
it is pleasantly astonishing to note that I was 
just about the only junior faculty member in that

05:49.833 --> 06:17.545
group,

05:49.833 --> 06:17.545
which included all

05:49.833 --> 06:17.545
of the other key campus leaders, deans, senior 
faculty member, directors,

06:18.790 --> 06:38.501
and the most recognized faculty.

06:38.521 --> 06:46.553
As the junior person in the room, in years,

06:38.521 --> 06:46.553
faculty rank and accomplishments,

06:48.237 --> 07:01.033
it was easy to understand how I became the 
secretary

06:48.237 --> 07:01.033
and note-taker for RISL.

07:03.736 --> 07:10.965
Soon we began the routine to meet every Tuesday 
afternoon, almost every Tuesday afternoon, for

07:03.736 --> 07:10.965
18 months.

07:15.331 --> 07:17.113
As we tried to plan our pathway

07:17.768 --> 07:46.105
many quote working parties quote were appointed

07:17.768 --> 07:46.105
to review specific

07:17.768 --> 07:46.105
topics

07:17.768 --> 07:46.105
including such notable issues as co-education 
racial integration, admission requirements,

07:47.907 --> 08:14.994
the Corps of Cadets, intramurals, student life, 
campus housing,

07:47.907 --> 08:14.994
curriculum,

07:47.907 --> 08:14.994
et cetera.

08:15.014 --> 08:17.897
At least one member of the RISL committee served 
with each working party, so there was splendid

08:18.907 --> 08:33.788
collaboration

08:18.907 --> 08:33.788
and communication.

08:39.275 --> 08:39.756
Paragraph. Among the most interesting of those 
groups was the working party that tried to

08:48.387 --> 09:11.995
understand

08:48.387 --> 09:11.995
more clearly

08:48.387 --> 09:11.995
the status of A&M as it was perceived by Texas high 
school students.

09:12.015 --> 09:16.420
That group led by Bardin, B-A-R-D-I-N, Nelson, a 
highly respected professor of rural sociology

09:17.733 --> 09:45.360
was able to survey almost

09:17.733 --> 09:45.360
all the high school juniors and seniors in a 32 
county area extending from Conroe just north of

09:17.733 --> 09:45.360
Houston

09:47.348 --> 09:59.240
in an arc up to East Dallas through East Texas, up 
through East Texas to the eastern edge of Dallas.

10:02.944 --> 10:15.077
He and Harold Brown,

10:02.944 --> 10:15.077
one of Dr. Nelson's young colleagues who happen to 
live directly across the street from us on Bolton,

10:16.778 --> 10:46.549
in the Eastgate area

10:16.778 --> 10:46.549
placed before these students questions

10:16.778 --> 10:46.549
which included inquiries about all of the eight 
major institutions in the state including SMU,

10:16.778 --> 10:46.549
TCU, Texas Tech, Baylor, Rice, the University of 
Texas, TSCW,

10:47.069 --> 11:02.473
the University of Texas at Austin, and A&M.

11:02.493 --> 11:10.866
They had to ask questions about all of the schools 
in order to gain access to the students.

11:14.828 --> 11:25.980
who had no idea that this was an A&M

11:14.828 --> 11:25.980
effort.

11:26.000 --> 11:44.160
They learned quickly that this survey quickly 
reflected

11:26.000 --> 11:44.160
the fact that the average student had a very 
limited knowledge of the academic areas offered

11:26.000 --> 11:44.160
at A&M. other than agriculture, engineering, and 
veterinary medicine.

11:51.378 --> 12:10.097
These prospective undergraduates were 
particularly unaware that majors were offered at

11:51.378 --> 12:10.097
College Station in the humanities, social 
sciences, business, education, et cetera.

12:14.313 --> 12:35.357
They also were well aware that

12:14.313 --> 12:35.357
A&M required every student to be male

12:14.313 --> 12:35.357
and to serve in the Corps of Cadets for the first two 
years.

12:35.377 --> 12:43.847
One young man, one anonymous young man, 
summarized his view in an unforgettable style.

12:46.072 --> 13:02.774
When he wrote, no girls, no fraternities, no fun, 
dash, no way, period, quote.

13:02.794 --> 13:12.366
On a far more positive basis, when the students 
were asked to identify the, quote,

13:14.202 --> 13:17.045
most outstanding schools in the state.

13:24.974 --> 13:25.895
They responded. Their responses were rice. 72% of 
them identified rice as one of that trio. Texas

13:35.986 --> 13:39.170
followed with 71 and A&M was third with 58. Then

13:39.330 --> 13:43.855
there was a surprisingly large gap to the number 
four choice SMU at 32%. Thus,

13:51.737 --> 14:14.145
A&M had the great advantage of having a 
comparatively strong profile for quality,

13:51.737 --> 14:14.145
but the difficulty of a lack of perception of what 
it offered. Another impressive result of the

14:16.302 --> 14:43.238
questionnaires was the overwhelming 
correlation between the students' class rank and

14:16.302 --> 14:43.238
other quality measurements

14:16.302 --> 14:43.238
and the absence of any interest by that student in 
going to an all-male institution.

14:56.162 --> 15:13.866
Perhaps that can be phrased better as the strong 
correlation between the students with high

14:56.162 --> 15:13.866
grades and class rank and their desire to go to a 
coeducational school.

15:18.250 --> 15:32.145
They were not, the best students were not 
interested in going to an all-male institution

15:18.250 --> 15:32.145
such as A&M or all-female such as the Texas State 
College for Women. Similarly, there was also a

15:33.727 --> 15:47.903
very clear link between the

15:48.541 --> 16:16.776
achieving students

15:48.541 --> 16:16.776
and their

15:48.541 --> 16:16.776
lack of interest in anything that was compulsory 
are required.

16:18.241 --> 16:47.623
Our SL work also caused us to look at A&M's official 
admission requirements

16:18.241 --> 16:47.623
and we learned that in fact those

16:18.241 --> 16:47.623
requirements included prohibited

16:18.241 --> 16:47.623
anyone

16:18.241 --> 16:47.623
with quote, a felony conviction, quote, or a 
quote, communicable disease, period, quote.

16:58.518 --> 17:16.783
Then, other than being white

16:58.518 --> 17:16.783
and male,

16:58.518 --> 17:16.783
each applicant had to have simply

17:20.442 --> 17:23.327
a high school diploma. There were no

17:23.347 --> 17:40.534
requirements

17:23.347 --> 17:40.534
of class rank,

17:23.347 --> 17:40.534
special courses

17:23.347 --> 17:40.534
and or admission scores.

17:46.644 --> 17:47.125
Obviously,

17:50.429 --> 18:14.631
That non-selective

17:50.429 --> 18:14.631
set of criterion permitted many students to 
enroll who were not well prepared

17:50.429 --> 18:14.631
for the rigor

17:50.429 --> 18:14.631
of college studies.

18:23.015 --> 18:46.440
After many months of hearing working party 
reports, studying their findings,

18:23.015 --> 18:46.440
and trying to look to the future,

18:23.015 --> 18:46.440
the RISL group met.

18:49.846 --> 19:11.218
And in what we later agreed was a truly 
unforgettable day,

18:49.846 --> 19:11.218
we voted on what our general recommendations 
would be in

18:49.846 --> 19:11.218
the aspirations report.

19:14.543 --> 19:16.225
Meanwhile, we were teasing our friends on the 
research and extension segment of the century

19:17.352 --> 19:42.904
study

19:17.352 --> 19:42.904
because it seemed to us that they simply had the 
easy task of recommending, quote, more and better

19:17.352 --> 19:42.904
of everything.

19:48.149 --> 20:09.904
During our deliberations, we had long agreed that 
we were to keep

19:48.149 --> 20:09.904
all of the reports, our deliberations, and any 
tentative recommendations in the conference of

19:48.149 --> 20:09.904
the committee's meeting room.

20:17.073 --> 20:40.539
Similarly, without agreeing upon such policy, we 
did not discuss with our committee colleagues

20:17.073 --> 20:40.539
our personal leanings.

20:40.559 --> 20:45.865
One reason for that reservation became obvious 
later when most of us admitted that we had feared we

20:47.212 --> 21:11.858
were the only one, that we were in a small majority 
of the committee

20:47.212 --> 21:11.858
who would vote in favor of change.

21:11.878 --> 21:15.902
That apprehension proved to be without 
foundation. when on one momentous day the

21:17.671 --> 21:42.801
RISL committee voted

21:17.671 --> 21:42.801
in what I believe, now recall, was a unanimous 
decision

21:17.671 --> 21:42.801
to favor

21:46.443 --> 22:12.400
making the Corps of Cadets optional to admit 
women,

21:46.443 --> 22:12.400
terminate racial integration,

21:46.443 --> 22:12.400
broaden the curriculum into an increasing 
horizon

21:46.443 --> 22:12.400
of disciplines,

21:46.443 --> 22:12.400
and add many more graduate and professional 
programs.

22:24.492 --> 22:39.838
As that session terminated and we walked away,

22:24.492 --> 22:39.838
we seemed to reflect proud

22:44.915 --> 22:48.819
and optimistic

22:44.915 --> 22:48.819
caution.

22:52.824 --> 23:10.783
Dash, because we wondered what

22:52.824 --> 23:10.783
the true decision makers would recommend.

23:10.803 --> 23:11.344
Another

23:17.382 --> 23:26.995
vote we took was to recommend that the title of the 
Agricultural and Mechanical College be changed.

23:32.101 --> 23:47.001
We had looked at other land grant institutions 
during the period of the century study

23:32.101 --> 23:47.001
and had invited

23:51.233 --> 24:02.049
Individuals familiar with those institutions to 
come and give us the benefit of their experience

23:51.233 --> 24:02.049
and judgment.

24:02.069 --> 24:03.211
These guests included. Mark

24:03.251 --> 24:11.183
Eric Walker, the president of Pennsylvania State 
University.

24:19.550 --> 24:48.072
and Dr. Derwood T. Verner, the number two man

24:19.550 --> 24:48.072
at Michigan State University,

24:19.550 --> 24:48.072
who had compiled a marvelous record at A&M in the 
class of 1940.

24:50.262 --> 24:54.727
a native of Cottonwood, Texas, a small crossroads 
junction near Abilene. He was Woody Varner to all

24:56.990 --> 25:01.715
Aggies. And he described for us how

25:01.735 --> 25:15.932
what had been the Michigan State College of 
Agriculture

25:01.735 --> 25:15.932
had within

25:19.507 --> 25:39.574
a decade and a half following World War II become 
Michigan State University,

25:19.507 --> 25:39.574
as it notably ascended in quality and fame.

25:53.695 --> 26:22.572
As we reviewed the separate land grant 
institutions,

25:53.695 --> 26:22.572
we learned that a number of those schools had once

25:53.695 --> 26:22.572
been titled

25:53.695 --> 26:22.572
for their state, plus the words Agricultural and 
Mechanical College, and then became

26:27.530 --> 26:42.147
the

26:27.530 --> 26:42.147
capital letter State University

26:27.530 --> 26:42.147
in their state. Thus, we recommended that the 
title of the separate land grant school for Texas

26:42.167 --> 26:55.242
be changed from the Agricultural Mechanical 
College of Texas to Texas State University,

26:55.947 --> 27:20.436
a title which we thought had worked, a shift which 
we thought had worked well in Oklahoma, Kansas,

26:55.947 --> 27:20.436
Mississippi,

26:55.947 --> 27:20.436
in comparatively recent years.

27:26.677 --> 27:56.228
Being the secretary of the committee, it became my 
responsibility to actually write and phrase the

27:26.677 --> 27:56.228
committee's findings,

27:26.677 --> 27:56.228
report, and recommendations for transmission

27:26.677 --> 27:56.228
to the campus administration. In that role, I was 
reporting to Dr. Wayne C. Hall,

27:58.030 --> 28:19.110
a marvelously talented scholar in plant 
pathology who was then the vice president for

27:58.030 --> 28:19.110
academic affairs and dean of the graduate school.

28:24.154 --> 28:27.177
When we completed our report, we turned it in.

28:30.565 --> 28:57.923
And we're a bit surprised to learn that instead of 
perhaps thousands of copies of the

28:30.565 --> 28:57.923
recommendations being made for statewide 
distribution, that there would be only four

28:30.565 --> 28:57.923
copies and they would be kept under very guarded 
and kept in very guarded privacy. Within a few

28:59.962 --> 29:27.977
days, I was summoned, received a call to report to 
Dr. Hall, and he handed me a copy of the report,

28:59.962 --> 29:27.977
which he said had been read by President Rutter, 
who had annotated it and added a number of

28:59.962 --> 29:27.977
questions.

29:30.556 --> 29:44.977
Dr. Hall then asked me to quote, revise the report 
to bring it in line with President Rutter's wishes

29:30.556 --> 29:44.977
and to get it back to him as soon as I could do so. As I 
turned the pages, I noticed such statements as no

29:47.060 --> 29:58.116
way, hell no, where did you get this stuff? can't do 
it.

30:05.082 --> 30:25.825
Thus, with a troubled fear in my mind and deep 
concern in my heart, I returned to the vice

30:05.082 --> 30:25.825
president's office

30:05.082 --> 30:25.825
and attempted to tell him but I could not in good 
faith make most of those changes.

30:34.223 --> 30:54.090
He inquired why I could not do so, and I told him it 
was because President Rutter was disagreeing in

30:34.223 --> 30:54.090
most instances with the committee's

30:34.223 --> 30:54.090
subjective judgments. which I verified might be 
incorrect. But the committee did truly believe

31:04.251 --> 31:24.634
that unless we modified the policies of 
segregation,

31:04.251 --> 31:24.634
of sexual

31:04.251 --> 31:24.634
segregation,

31:28.141 --> 31:29.629
unless we modified the power.
