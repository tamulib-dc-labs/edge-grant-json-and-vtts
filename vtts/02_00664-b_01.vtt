00:12.552 --> 00:14.094
Is Admiral Redfield still alive? Yes. Is he 
somewhere around this area? Yes, he is. Lives

00:16.496 --> 00:17.197
right up here. Wonderful person. I want to go see 
him. Okay. All right. You're at Pearl Harbor,

00:21.923 --> 00:22.984
then? At Pearl Harbor. This is at Pearl Harbor in 
the spring of 1944. Having been sent there as a

00:29.411 --> 00:39.943
representative of the Bureau of Ships to offer my 
services to Commander Submarine's Pacific Fleet

00:29.411 --> 00:39.943
in largely in connection with the bath 
demographic, but in any way one can be useful. This

00:45.949 --> 00:50.796
entailed one or two trips, side trips, to Midway to 
catch submarines there. There was a large number

00:50.836 --> 00:54.781
of submarines at Pearl. What I tried to do was to see 
as many people as I could to

00:55.602 --> 01:05.695
distribute

01:08.375 --> 01:11.439
Really, it was an educational trip, both for them 
and for us. And I tried to report pretty regularly

01:12.901 --> 01:23.655
back to both the Woods Hole and to Revell in 
Washington to let them know what we might be able to

01:12.901 --> 01:23.655
do better.

01:26.539 --> 01:28.922
Admiral Lockwood was sub-pac.

01:31.665 --> 01:36.171
His assistant operations officer was then 
Commander Grenfell, who was the most senior

01:37.282 --> 01:51.878
oceanographer, who was the most senior submarine 
man I had had any long acquaintance with because he

01:37.282 --> 01:51.878
had been involved in the Bureau of Ships in 
Washington.

01:54.781 --> 02:01.829
I would like to relate one discussion I had with 
Admiral Grenfell when I arrived out there. And

02:02.290 --> 02:07.035
incidentally, I had great respect for Grenfell 
then and have continued to over the many years that

02:07.606 --> 02:16.136
I have known him as being a man who works very hard 
for his boys, the submarine people. Well, when I

02:17.518 --> 02:36.921
got out there, I looked up Grenfell and said, 
Commander, I'd like very much to have you listen to

02:17.518 --> 02:36.921
what I have to say because I don't know very much 
about submarines, and I know that I know a great

02:17.518 --> 02:36.921
deal more about than any of my bosses did in 
Washington or at Woods Hole, and when I give them a

02:37.188 --> 02:54.535
line of patter in the Atlantic, that's one thing, 
but when you talk to them at Pearl or Midway when

02:37.188 --> 02:54.535
they're about to start out on a patrol, one feels a 
little bit more serious. Well, Grenfell listened

02:56.719 --> 02:59.483
for a little while, and then He said, Alan, I 
wouldn't really worry very much. He said, first, I

03:03.443 --> 03:07.389
think most of what you have to say makes pretty good 
sense. And for the rest of it, I think

03:08.570 --> 03:16.381
oceanography, the rest of it, I think submarine 
people are smart enough not to pay any attention to

03:08.570 --> 03:16.381
it. Well, many times since, when I have been giving 
a talk or something like that, and my nerve has kind

03:18.224 --> 03:28.137
of wavered, I remember what Grenfell have said. 
said, and felt, you're talking to adults. You tell

03:33.826 --> 03:37.330
them what you think they ought to know, and let them 
make up their own mind. Well, this general sense

03:38.591 --> 03:42.976
prevailed in Pearl Harbor. We took many manuals 
with us,

03:45.419 --> 03:58.292
and we had a magnificent opportunity to teach. And 
this was real teaching. One of the things we

04:01.478 --> 04:14.840
quickly found out was you go through the ship, 
inspect their apparatus, and see if it was

04:01.478 --> 04:14.840
working, and if not, do whatever was necessary to 
get the people on the beach to fix anything that you

04:01.478 --> 04:14.840
couldn't. Then you go to the junior officer and 
find out what reports he had, a piece of paper he had

04:16.583 --> 04:22.913
to do with the bath thermograph. And you might find 
that he had not all very little, or you might find

04:23.922 --> 04:31.875
that he had a lot of junk that was obsolete, and you 
could help him throw it away. One of the most

04:32.236 --> 04:38.446
important things you could do was to get stuff off 
the ship. Then, if somebody was going out on

04:38.466 --> 04:44.817
patrol, you seldom knew exactly what they were 
doing, because... People like technicians were

04:45.758 --> 05:00.384
not cleared for such information unless what they 
were working on affected

04:45.758 --> 05:00.384
the expedition very much. But you quickly found 
out that after the captain knew where he was sent,

05:05.654 --> 05:17.477
Then you sit down with he and his sonar officer and 
by this time you knew the month that was involved.

05:18.539 --> 05:27.156
You knew the general area either from what he sort 
of blocked it out or which particular areas that he

05:18.539 --> 05:27.156
was paying the most attention to. Then you could 
take a red grease pencil, and you could start

05:27.423 --> 05:36.254
circling the few paragraphs in a thick document 
that might really affect him. You could circle,

05:36.774 --> 05:39.358
indicate the graphs. You were doing him the most 
favor if you tore all the other pages out of the book

05:39.818 --> 05:51.152
and threw them away, and then wrote about a 
one-page addendum that would be most pertinent

05:51.740 --> 06:00.674
for him and what he sometimes felt was his 
particular way that he liked to make an attack or

05:51.740 --> 06:00.674
some such thing as this.

06:01.855 --> 06:07.985
Brevity, brevity, brevity, and fundamentalism, 
because these were smart people. And if you could

06:08.005 --> 06:16.077
give them the principle of what you were after, 
they were apt to, about a half of them or a third of

06:08.005 --> 06:16.077
them would do very well.

06:19.567 --> 06:30.721
As I've said earlier, these were the people that at 
later dates and later jobs, they were some of the

06:19.567 --> 06:30.721
best friends that oceanography and science ever 
had. Over the years, they frequently had much

06:33.344 --> 06:38.710
higher standards for oceanography than the 
oceanographers themselves. And many times when

06:40.373 --> 06:48.122
we used their submarines, whether they were 
operational officers on the staffs who were there

06:48.659 --> 06:52.683
running the submarines themselves. They went 
beyond the call of duty to see that things got done.

06:58.330 --> 07:04.276
Well, we come to

06:58.330 --> 07:04.276
the end of the war. And here, of course, it was the 
end of the war in the Pacific that counted, because

07:04.416 --> 07:13.266
in the submarine navy, it was almost entirely the 
Pacific.

07:14.948 --> 07:17.130
This was a period, of course, in which We visited 
quite a few of the laboratories. The Navy

07:21.912 --> 07:33.247
laboratories, oceanographic laboratories were 
involved in a good deal of touring around amongst

07:21.912 --> 07:33.247
each other's laboratories, helping each other 
out. The cooperation was wonderful.

07:43.279 --> 07:45.582
Let me short one thing here. You have three papers 
that really come out of this submarine work in

07:45.747 --> 07:49.711
1946, don't you? Yes. Okay. Well... The one on 
underwater photography comes out in 1946. Yes.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.081
And then two that come out on the submarines. I 
think this was from data you collected here at

07:59.761 --> 08:01.923
Woodrow? Most of the work that was... Most of the 
submarine work that was done never really came out

08:05.968 --> 08:15.197
as a report except it came out most in the 
summary... In the technical reports, in the bound

08:16.291 --> 08:27.903
technical reports that the NDRC published at the 
end of the war, these have been declassified.

08:28.023 --> 08:30.926
There aren't very many of them around. We took the 
general trend that, in my own case,

08:30.946 --> 08:44.020
it seemed like it was a better thing not to publish 
too much of that stuff. Because when you make

08:45.772 --> 08:58.939
friends with a few hundred people in the silent 
service, you develop a tendency to respect their

08:45.772 --> 08:58.939
general thoughts and way of operation.

09:02.586 --> 09:07.476
The sound channel work and some of the acoustics 
work that was done done by Ewing and Warzel, of

09:07.945 --> 09:13.651
which I was in on much in the beginning, but only the 
periphery at the end. These were things which

09:15.373 --> 09:24.522
really the Navy wasn't particularly interested 
in at the end of the war, because they felt it was not

09:15.373 --> 09:24.522
important to anti-submarine warfare work and so 
forth. So that was published rather quickly.

09:30.488 --> 09:37.615
At the end of the war,

09:30.488 --> 09:37.615
Project Crossroads the concept of testing of 
these new nuclear devices came along. Revell was a

09:43.945 --> 09:48.590
great ringleader in that in Washington. And for 
the Bikini tests in the summer of 46, Project

09:50.152 --> 10:02.525
Crossroads, quite a large number of 
oceanographers got out there. In fact, at one

10:03.747 --> 10:06.690
time, there were about 40 people from Woods Hole 
Many of these were hired for the job on

10:07.278 --> 10:12.286
radiological safety work. But my involvement was 
largely through Revell, but it was with a wave

10:13.067 --> 10:34.399
measurement group in which we were trying to see 
how high the waves would be that were caused by the

10:13.067 --> 10:34.399
atomic blast, both the air blast and the 
underwater blast.

10:39.290 --> 10:45.638
From Woods Hole, an engineer, Otis Hunt, who 
worked with me on instruments, went. Sever

10:46.819 --> 10:55.129
Harlow, who was a mechanic

10:46.819 --> 10:55.129
over at the Marine Biological Laboratory and quit 
to go out with us. He also was a very junior sailor

10:56.411 --> 11:08.185
mechanic at the time the NC boats flew across the 
Atlantic. So He was interested in this sort of

11:08.939 --> 11:10.922
thing. And John Parkinson, who was sort of a junior 
Harvard classmate of Columbus's and had been a DE

11:11.122 --> 11:29.068
skipper during the war, and he felt it would be very 
interesting to see this bomb and its effects. We

11:31.172 --> 11:35.638
were attached to the submarine tender Fulton out 
in Pearl and to go out to Bikini. They worked very

11:42.587 --> 12:03.217
hard getting ready with our equipment, which our 
primary equipment consisted of about a dozen

11:42.587 --> 12:03.217
instruments which we called turtles that were 
steel cases with recording clocks and pressure

11:42.587 --> 12:03.217
gauges that would basically try and measure the 
height of the wave that passed over them.

12:06.341 --> 12:06.722
The important part of these instruments, where 
they were completely self-contained. There was

12:12.014 --> 12:14.237
no electronics associated with them. And we felt 
that they might not give the best data in the world,

12:15.178 --> 12:22.465
but they would give data. And knowing that so many 
things could go wrong, we felt that was important.

12:28.752 --> 12:32.676
On the Fulton, they had a variety of people from 
other laboratories. I was particularly

12:33.668 --> 12:50.851
interested to get to know better people like John 
Isaacs from Scripps and then at the University of

12:33.668 --> 12:50.851
California and Scripps, who were measured in the 
wave measurement group. This whole thing has

12:52.814 --> 13:02.207
slowed up a little bit because just after we sailed 
from California, we received word that the tests

12:52.814 --> 13:02.207
were going to be postponed for about a month. 
Rather than turning around and going back with all

13:03.925 --> 13:14.876
the confusion, I decided to stay out in Pearl for 
that time, as most of the others. This gave us a

13:15.316 --> 13:25.887
chance to give some proper testing to our 
apparatus, which had received only a disgraceful

13:15.316 --> 13:25.887
small amount of testing before we left Woods Hole. 
And it also gave me a chance to... go to the

13:31.955 --> 13:43.312
submarine base and see what the chances were of 
continuing some of the tests on particularly the

13:31.955 --> 13:43.312
submerged performance characteristics of 
submarines. We had done a bit of this during the

13:44.053 --> 13:55.950
war, which came about because really

13:44.053 --> 13:55.950
of the density layers. We would tell submarines 
that a dense layer would amount to a ton, and some of

13:58.128 --> 14:07.419
them would laugh and say, but we have other 
problems with our boats, which are much more

13:58.128 --> 14:07.419
important than that. And it was very clear that 
they had no document that told them how their

14:08.420 --> 14:15.208
submarine operated underwater. They had no sets 
of curves or vertical motions. vertical turning

14:22.225 --> 14:25.989
circles, things like this. And much of their 
folklore was very good. Much of their folklore was

14:31.254 --> 14:33.135
very bad. And it was extremely difficult for 
junior officers to learn to dive their boat

14:34.336 --> 14:47.409
quickly because they had no sound, reasonably 
sound, even thumb rules to go by. This was a little

14:47.449 --> 14:50.832
flabbergasting. to us. We'd run into it early and 
did some things about it. In fact, we helped the

14:56.707 --> 15:18.962
Ascania Regulator Company make modifications to 
the submarine diving trainer so they could put

14:56.707 --> 15:18.962
temperature gradients into the fictitious ocean 
which these submarine trainers

14:56.707 --> 15:18.962
dove into.

15:24.072 --> 15:34.302
Of the kinds of things we were interested in here 
was,

15:24.072 --> 15:34.302
could a submarine sit on a density layer? For 
example, if they lost all power in the war zone,

15:36.684 --> 15:53.860
would they have to surface and surrender or shoot 
it out when they were outgunned a hundredfold or

15:36.684 --> 15:53.860
surrender, or would they Let her sink to the 
bottom, or might they be able to set out on a density

15:54.464 --> 15:59.269
layer? And we had experiments. One of the first 
ones was on the darter, in

16:02.051 --> 16:21.431
which we got the submarine skipper to get a stop 
trim at periscope depth, flood in about a ton of

16:02.051 --> 16:21.431
water when he was dead in the water, and let it sink. 
At that time, we had a density. fairly good thermal

16:23.843 --> 16:28.589
layer at about 180 feet. All the time we were 
sinking, the way the crew was trying to lay bets

16:30.631 --> 16:42.526
with you is how high would you bet that the 
submarine would stop when it hit the density layer

16:30.631 --> 16:42.526
or keep on sinking. And we had a good density layer. 
It was just like falling into a feather bed. But the

16:50.056 --> 16:53.580
nice thing that it showed was that we only exceeded 
the neutral depth by about 10 or 12 feet. And this

17:00.617 --> 17:06.826
was one of the early tests that showed us that the 
submarines could rely on this density layer.

17:12.195 --> 17:22.150
We did other tests like this, one on the batfish, in 
which we flooded in water at about, flooded in

17:23.210 --> 17:31.361
about 5,000 pounds at periscope depth when we were 
stopped to see how rapidly we would fall. And a

17:31.401 --> 17:35.407
submarine has a lot of resistance when you try and 
push it sideways. So you really have a couple of

17:36.769 --> 17:50.668
minutes, even though you're perhaps 10,000 
pounds heavy, a submarine without any propulsion

17:36.769 --> 17:50.668
at all, if it is dead in the water, has one and a half 
or two minutes before it gets to collapse depth. So

17:56.431 --> 18:19.643
if a skipper can take advantage of this extra time 
and find out what is wrong with a submarine,

17:56.431 --> 18:19.643
then he may be able to fix something or have a bright 
idea before he

17:56.431 --> 18:19.643
gets into real extremis and before he surfaces, 
which is one of the most dangerous things they can

17:56.431 --> 18:19.643
do. Well, this particular time on the Batfish was 
very interesting because it tells something

18:21.631 --> 18:28.841
about the submarine operator's character. The 
captain turned the dive over to me, and we fell

18:29.662 --> 18:38.855
gracefully and smoothly, taking the date as we 
went, down to about 200 feet. And then we went down

18:39.116 --> 18:49.410
to about

18:39.116 --> 18:49.410
300 feet.

18:52.529 --> 18:55.573
The data was coming along very well, and I had about 
all I wanted. I sort of indicated to the captain

18:55.593 --> 18:59.778
that he could take over, and he indicated, no, keep 
going. So we got down to test depth, and then we went

18:59.918 --> 19:09.609
a little bit deeper, and I figured there's no point 
in playing chicken with that particular

18:59.918 --> 19:09.609
commanding officer. So in a loud, clear voice, I 
said, Captain, the test is satisfactorily

19:10.530 --> 19:18.620
completed. I turn the boat back over to you. And the 
captain, quick as a wink, picked up the general

19:21.824 --> 19:30.517
communication system in the submarine. And as 
part of his education program, he said, attention

19:30.577 --> 19:34.483
all hands. Our visiting scientist oceanographer 
friend,

19:35.845 --> 19:50.346
he said, now that we are past test depth, 8,000 
pounds heavy, dead in the water, falling past test

19:52.317 --> 20:22.037
depth our oceanographer scientist friend has 
turned the submarine back to the captain I thank

19:52.317 --> 20:22.037
him blow safety well this was a magnificent 
opportunity the captain wanted everybody on the

19:52.317 --> 20:22.037
ship to know the status he had been advising them so 
that when he blew safety and we started going back

19:52.317 --> 20:22.037
up again they could say hey Everybody

20:22.523 --> 20:50.033
on the ship would know that this was something 
which was foreseen, predictable, and when it

20:22.523 --> 20:50.033
happened, it was something they could count on in 
the future.

20:52.240 --> 21:01.431
We're back out at Operations Crossroads at Pearl 
Harbor while we were waiting for Operations

20:52.240 --> 21:01.431
Crossroads.

21:03.974 --> 21:17.250
Captain Grenfell had by this time become a captain 
of squadron commander, and he turned the boat over

21:03.974 --> 21:17.250
to us for about a week to go out and do testing of what 
we would do each morning. We would...

21:21.755 --> 21:40.919
We would do testing of free falls, such things, and 
such things as telling how much the boat would tilt

21:21.755 --> 21:40.919
as people moved back and forth in it, and trying to 
quantify the motions of the boat underwater. And

21:41.720 --> 21:49.990
then in the afternoon, we would plan everything so 
the battery would be run pretty well dead by late

21:41.720 --> 21:49.990
afternoon. And we would try and see what 
combinations of bow and stern planes would give

21:50.442 --> 22:04.841
what diving characteristics, how quickly one 
could pull out of deep dives, high angles, and so

21:50.442 --> 22:04.841
forth. Perhaps the most important part about this 
was not that the tests themselves, because they

22:05.022 --> 22:18.019
were fairly simple and fundamental, but the 
report was written up In one week, the report was

22:18.742 --> 22:24.808
written up, duplicated, and sent out to every 
submarine in the Pacific Fleet. So this was an

22:24.828 --> 22:27.871
indication of the fact that communication was 
working. In this discussion of submarine

22:30.093 --> 22:40.703
performance, I don't want to leave the impression 
that some of us at Woods Hole knew more about

22:30.093 --> 22:40.703
submarines than the operators. This was not the 
case at all. What it amounted to... was that we

22:45.320 --> 22:56.757
would sometimes talk some of their bosses into 
getting some time so the submarine people could do

22:45.320 --> 22:56.757
some tests, which many of them would like to have 
done anyhow. What we tended to do was to systemize

22:56.777 --> 23:11.378
the approach so that the things that were done 
could come out with a little bit simpler thumb

22:56.777 --> 23:11.378
rolls so the junior people could learn a little 
faster. And what we felt was equally important,

23:11.628 --> 23:31.176
that the senior people might be able to take these 
same ground rules and, in cases of extremis, could

23:11.628 --> 23:31.176
estimate a little further how far the design of 
their boat and the constitution of the ocean would

23:11.628 --> 23:31.176
permit them to go.

23:35.983 --> 23:40.369
Getting back to Crossroads.

23:42.273 --> 23:46.078
It was, in my way of thinking, a really wonderful 
set of tests. And the fact that the vast majority of

23:48.622 --> 24:07.888
the work was unclassified, that they had foreign 
observers, and the fact that this information of

23:48.622 --> 24:07.888
this new device got out into the world at large in a 
quantitative fashion. I think the job of the

24:07.908 --> 24:10.491
Defense Department and the Atomic Energy 
Commission and so forth did in writing this

24:11.163 --> 24:19.033
information up was really a great service to 
mankind. I'm

24:19.053 --> 24:30.787
not approving of the fact that it would be just as 
nice if we didn't have the bomb, but that is a matter

24:19.053 --> 24:30.787
of reality. It is very important that people know 
what they have. Military people and civilians all

24:36.104 --> 24:41.993
over the world realize they have a different kind 
of beast than they had before.

24:45.899 --> 24:52.489
In general, the tests out there were fairly 
successful, the tests we were involved with. But

24:52.970 --> 24:57.697
it was an opportunity to work with a good many 
people. Some very simple instrumentation. We had

25:00.541 --> 25:03.546
our one set of instrumentation at the bottom. Some 
of you may notice, if you see the most common

25:05.365 --> 25:26.944
picture of the underwater blast, showing this 
great mushroom going up in the water, going up the

25:05.365 --> 25:26.944
column of water, going up in the air, that in some of 
these pictures, there's a pine, there's a palm

25:05.365 --> 25:26.944
tree in the foreground. And on the palm tree, next 
to the palm tree, there's a stepladder. And on the

25:31.028 --> 25:33.870
palm tree, there are some tin cans nailed. These 
are wave gauges in case the water got so high that it

25:34.778 --> 25:42.528
went up over the land and tried to cover up the palm 
tree.

25:46.353 --> 25:57.968
Only reason I mention that is because we tried 
there, as most of the field workers I have

25:46.353 --> 25:57.968
acquainted with, whom I have great respect for, 
know perfectly well that in the field almost

25:58.640 --> 26:03.431
anything can happen. And one should aim an 
experiment so that you get some kind of data almost

26:03.451 --> 26:17.644
no matter how the experiment goes or what 
particularly casually fate plays on you at the

26:03.451 --> 26:17.644
moment.

26:22.838 --> 26:36.915
Coming back to Woods Hole in the fall of 46, summer 
of 46 after Crossroads,

26:22.838 --> 26:36.915
there were several changes. One, Ewing had gone to 
Columbia University with Warzel. A good many of

26:42.522 --> 26:52.474
the wartime people were pulling out to bracket 
Hersey, Columbus University, Columbus Island

26:52.927 --> 27:01.375
got Brackett Hersey to come in and head up an 
acoustics group, head up the acoustics group. At

27:01.415 --> 27:06.761
that time, I believe I was listed as, started off as 
a physicist. I think along about that time,

27:06.841 --> 27:11.285
Columbus classified me as a physical 
oceanographer. I suppose largely because I'd

27:11.445 --> 27:20.554
been spending a lot of my time on physical 
oceanography, but principally because he was

27:11.445 --> 27:20.554
into the kind of work we were doing. He was a 
physical oceanographer, and he probably thought

27:20.888 --> 27:26.134
that the best work was done by physical 
oceanographers. So he'd just put his little clan

27:26.194 --> 27:31.140
and call them physical oceanographers.

27:35.364 --> 27:44.635
Fritz Fuglester

27:35.364 --> 27:44.635
was far more of a physical oceanographer and had 
been. spending nearly all of his time on that kind

27:45.543 --> 27:51.108
of thing, where I'd only been spending a 
peripheral length of time. But on the other hand,

27:51.128 --> 28:03.339
as

27:51.128 --> 28:03.339
I indicated earlier, one of the relationships 
that we had in jobs ahead was, how do you talk to

27:51.128 --> 28:03.339
submarine people? How do you think about 
oceanography and underwater sound on a global

28:03.720 --> 28:15.010
basis, at least a Western Pacific basis?

28:19.597 --> 28:30.690
About this time after Crossroads, Roger Revelle 
left the Bureau of Ships and moved over to the newly

28:19.597 --> 28:30.690
formed Office of Naval Research. It asked me if I 
would take over his job in the Bureau of Ships.

28:39.501 --> 28:45.148
This I did not want to do, but I said I would do it half 
time.

28:47.069 --> 28:57.763
My personal position was that I had just bought a 
house only about 200 yards from the Oceanographic

28:47.069 --> 28:57.763
Institution. I had the feeling that, well, I 
really should solve the commuting problem. Then I

29:03.651 --> 29:12.823
signed on for three years, spending every other 
week in Washington, which shows you win some, you

29:03.651 --> 29:12.823
lose some. Working in Washington was extremely 
interesting, and I was very glad that I did it, and I

29:14.035 --> 29:35.243
heartily recommend that many more people get a job 
in Washington, also

29:14.035 --> 29:35.243
particularly in the formative period of their 
lives.

29:39.228 --> 29:43.333
Roger was administering the bulk of oceanography 
at that time in the country, And for a while there,

29:44.528 --> 29:52.816
well, he was administering the bulk of 
oceanography in the country. So for a while, I was

29:52.856 --> 30:07.749
in this desk, was probably administering, in 
fact, I think probably a higher percentage of the

29:52.856 --> 30:07.749
funding of civilian oceanography than anybody 
has since, because there wasn't much other. That

30:07.789 --> 30:08.790
was that simple. Roger left. a great deal of 
unfinished business about a whole file cabinet

30:13.047 --> 30:20.514
full of unanswered correspondence. And the only 
stipulation I made with Roger when I took the job

30:20.534 --> 30:38.811
was that it would not be necessary for him to pass on 
anything, that I would not have to wait for him to do

30:20.534 --> 30:38.811
anything because he tended to be slow and 
meticulous. I knew I'd never get through that

30:38.851 --> 30:40.793
cabinet. This was no problem. Roger was a 
wonderful person to deal with, and I spent a great

30:42.763 --> 30:49.012
deal of time with him while he was in ONR.

30:54.059 --> 31:01.110
The several things that I got out of that job was, 
first, one thing.
