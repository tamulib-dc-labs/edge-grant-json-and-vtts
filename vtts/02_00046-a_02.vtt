00:02.883 --> 00:04.504
Court trip to Fort Worth. Fort Worth. Describe 
that. Oh, that was hectic. I was just a young kid. No

00:08.949 --> 00:12.332
money or anything like that, but I had tickets to 
the football game. Well, we get there in this room,

00:12.832 --> 00:17.997
and we had all these Aggies, all freshmen. We were 
all in there, and, you know, there wasn't much

00:18.017 --> 00:20.800
drinking. Hardly any drinking at all. There was 
some that liked it at that age, and I never drank at

00:23.422 --> 00:32.130
all at A&M except when we had the fish party. And 
that's the last time I drank at A&M, believe me. My

00:36.594 --> 00:41.743
whole four years I never drank any alcohol at all, 
or smoked cigarettes. But at TCU, in the same hotel

00:43.225 --> 00:51.840
with girls from Tissy, from Denton. and TSCW and 
they were there and so it was really a nice party and

00:52.259 --> 01:00.071
nothing permissive was about it at all. It was just 
wholesome fun and they knew we didn't have any

01:00.531 --> 01:09.064
money so they didn't care about making demands on 
us. We all went to the game together and we all came

01:09.745 --> 01:18.418
back and we had good bull session with the girls and 
everything. And then about 3 o'clock in the

01:18.905 --> 01:23.459
morning, 2 o'clock in the morning, everybody 
decided they better go to sleep. Everybody left.

01:25.465 --> 01:30.479
And you marched down the street in the review. Yes, 
sir. Any negative? Did anything ever happen badly

01:32.763 --> 01:36.730
during a formal review? I can't recall anything. 
The crowd cheered us every time we'd come by. They

01:43.081 --> 01:50.093
cheered and cheered and cheered and it just made 
you feel proud to be an Aggie. That fall, there must

01:50.427 --> 01:59.241
have been some special football moments that you 
remember because we had a pretty good team that

01:50.427 --> 01:59.241
fall. We had a good team, great national 
champions. Yes. What were some favorite moments

02:03.528 --> 02:05.351
you remember? Well, every game we had at College 
Station was a great moment because we had this guy

02:06.954 --> 02:17.751
named Jordan John Kimbrough.

02:18.052 --> 02:20.537
We'd holler for Joran John, Joran John. So even the 
Texas game, we were never worried about it. But we

02:28.295 --> 02:37.174
used to farm, we used to have, we farmed the tea, 
block tea, which they don't do now. And the Yale

02:37.559 --> 02:43.969
leaders would get on top of the press box and we'd be 
on the cow field, farmed in tea. And I think that was

02:44.530 --> 02:46.974
just great. Now, during that year, that fall,

02:46.994 --> 03:00.254
describe a typical home Saturday. You got up 
and... Oh, Saturday morning, the day of the game.

03:05.150 --> 03:06.252
Everybody's excited. Go to breakfast, wait 
tables, and then go back. And noon was a great

03:12.361 --> 03:18.871
occasion because here comes, well, yeah, my fish 
year. I was just a freshman with a white jacket on,

03:20.193 --> 03:23.938
and the girls were all there. But my senior year, 
when I was waiting tables for a typical football

03:25.681 --> 03:32.912
game, had the boots on, and the girls admired the 
boots, and you come up with those. starchy white

03:32.892 --> 03:37.940
jackets, you know, you really made a nice 
presentation. And the girls would go, oh, oh, oh,

03:37.960 --> 03:40.604
you know. But a typical day, everybody was in a 
hurry to get to the game, and we all sat together,

03:41.125 --> 03:52.863
just like they do today. And then we watched the 
ball game, and of course, Was there a Friday night

03:58.812 --> 04:00.935
Yale practice? Midnight, yes, we had midnight 
Yale practice. And it was held at the Y? At the Y, on

04:06.202 --> 04:11.989
the steps of the YMCA, sure were, right there by the 
bugle stand. Describe your memory of some of these

04:12.991 --> 04:18.238
famous football, Aggie football players. What 
was John Kimbrough like as a person? John

04:21.041 --> 04:26.068
Kimbrough as a person, and I really got to know him 
because I was a freshman football player. but as a

04:26.622 --> 04:31.631
person was genuinely one of the finest persons 
I've met from Haskell, Texas. Always

04:32.693 --> 04:40.969
accommodating, always smiling, and always doing 
the right thing and never bad mouthing anybody.

04:41.405 --> 04:45.772
great All-American guard A&M had, tough as they 
make them boy. He was just opposite of John. But he

04:47.755 --> 04:48.857
was pleasant too. He was a nice guy. He never abused 
anybody. And Jim Thomason was sort of a quiet

04:52.943 --> 05:00.175
person, but he was the leading blocker for 
Kimbrough. Herb Smith was the end. And just Cotton

05:02.178 --> 05:04.662
Price was a quarterback. And did all those 
football players go to class? They all went to

05:08.204 --> 05:09.306
class. They lived in dorms. If they didn't live 
with their unit, and I lived with my unit, A

05:10.989 --> 05:16.557
battery, then I got transferred to H battery. But 
we had dorm 12, was the athletic dorm. And if the

05:22.527 --> 05:25.692
athletes didn't want to live with the unit, they 
lived over there. Now they were kind of a rowdy

05:25.712 --> 05:27.915
bunch over there. Yeah, he couldn't study in 
there.

05:34.343 --> 05:36.328
But they didn't get any give-away grades. No. They 
had to go to class like everybody else. Oh, no. In

05:41.594 --> 05:46.241
fact, I think the profs made it tougher on us.

05:47.262 --> 05:51.429
Who were some of the other famous students when you 
were here? Kimbrough and, you mentioned

05:52.510 --> 05:54.734
Kimbrough and Robinette. Who were some of the 
other celebrities? Celebrities? Today, you

05:57.498 --> 05:58.259
mean? Uh-huh. Bob Bright. Went from Dallas. He 
happened, his name was Bright and my name was

06:02.388 --> 06:11.602
Cocono so when we stood in line alphabetically he 
was always in front of me and I said, what's your

06:02.388 --> 06:11.602
name? He said Bright. Where you from, Dallas? 
Where you from, Beaumont? So we became dear

06:15.813 --> 06:17.095
friends. I didn't know who he was. He didn't know 
who I was. Did he have that nickname then? Oh, yeah.

06:23.923 --> 06:25.185
How did he get that, do you know? I have no idea how 
Bum got that name. But what a fine person. Who were

06:30.692 --> 06:35.037
some other famous Aggies that you knew as 
students? At that time, other than athletes, I'm

06:35.457 --> 06:41.625
trying to think. Well, who were your best buddies, 
your best friends, when you were a student? Well,

06:47.261 --> 07:05.588
my basketball comrade were friends, Raymond 
Clutch, Pete Watkins, who held the high jump

06:47.261 --> 07:05.588
record at Drake for 20-some odd years, and who

06:47.261 --> 07:05.588
else? Daddy Green, the swimming All-American. 
You want to hear that story? Yes, please. I'm

07:14.361 --> 07:21.970
sitting on the basketball bench one afternoon my 
junior year when I was resting. We were practicing

07:22.370 --> 07:27.897
and Coach Art Adamson You know, he wasn't a very 
outgoing person, but he was a nice guy, really

07:28.754 --> 07:34.120
nice. Never said much to anybody, but he always put 
out winners. World champion water polo team and

07:38.024 --> 07:43.470
swimmers and Danny Green, All-American. And he 
comes sitting down beside me. I looked at him and

07:48.076 --> 07:50.718
said to myself, that's unusual. He never sits by 
anybody, you know. So next thing I know, he's

07:53.782 --> 07:58.407
asking me, he says, Mike, I understand you're 
quite a swimmer. And, you know, I'm thinking,

07:59.939 --> 08:03.946
what's he going, what's he leading up to? I said, 
no, I'm not, coach. I'm a terrible swimmer. I

08:07.231 --> 08:09.535
hadn't swam since I've been here. He said, well, I 
didn't come to ask you to be on the swimming team. I

08:13.081 --> 08:14.583
come to ask you to be my diver. I said, what? Diver? 
How did you know I dive? He said, I looked it up in the

08:20.358 --> 08:27.985
Beaumont, Texas YMCA office, they told me you won 
the state championship diving and everything. He

08:28.686 --> 08:33.430
said, he said, my diver quit and I need a diver. 
Won't you help me? Boy, and I was coming from Coach

08:35.712 --> 08:39.355
Adamson, that's something. He said, sure coach. 
So I was the diver for the A&M swimming team and then

08:41.197 --> 08:50.145
I think the record will reflect that out of eight 
colleges at the conference meet, came out fifth.

08:55.358 --> 08:55.859
Pretty good. Now, did he give you any scholarship? 
No, sir. It was all for free? All free, volunteer.

09:03.828 --> 09:07.512
What year was that that you joined swimming? It was 
41-42 year. So, your third year. My third year.

09:13.839 --> 09:19.525
When you first got here, the YMCA was the social 
center? It was a gathering point. Yeah. Describe

09:21.885 --> 09:24.410
what all y'all did at the YMCA. Well they had, I 
didn't go there very often because I was too busy

09:24.430 --> 09:36.838
doing other things, but they had a pool table and 
people playing pool and ping pong. And it was there

09:36.818 --> 09:41.924
where the Y, I think it's still there, in that same 
building. Only they didn't have very many, they

09:42.184 --> 09:49.812
didn't have much room, but I think they've 
accumulated more room today. But it was, I'm

09:50.393 --> 09:55.758
trying to remember the director of the Y. Cashin. 
Cashin. Mr. Cashin. He sure was. And it was just, a

10:03.667 --> 10:09.236
small area to go to and get away from everything and 
it was nice. Mr. Cashin, that's right. Did you ever

10:10.538 --> 10:15.966
see his two little boys, Red and Jim? Let me tell you 
about Red. When I was a varsity basketball player,

10:18.490 --> 10:22.636
Red was about 12 years old. And he would, somehow we 
got to be dear friends. And he would wait for me the

10:27.950 --> 10:31.874
day of the game at the front. I said, you wait for me 
at the gate when I get there and I'll take you into

10:31.894 --> 10:36.659
the game. He said, yes sir. And so he'd wait, when 
I'd come up he'd be there waiting. I said, come on in

10:41.425 --> 10:43.106
Red, come on in. Let him in, he's with me. And so we'd 
go to the locker room and he'd get my sweat clothes

10:45.209 --> 10:52.877
and he'd get my tape and make sure my ankles were 
taped right. What an experience and what a guy he is

10:53.684 --> 10:57.010
today. But every game, Red was waiting for me at the 
gate. Share some memories of that first

11:03.061 --> 11:07.450
basketball season here for you. For me? I was a 
sophomore. Oh, so freshmen, you all didn't play

11:09.293 --> 11:12.517
games? We didn't play a scheduled game. I was a 
sophomore. And

11:18.065 --> 11:23.732
start practicing, practice, practice. For some 
reason or another, Coach McQuillan let me be the

11:23.752 --> 11:29.580
point guard. And the point guard was a senior named 
Sammy Dwyer. He was a senior. I don't know if I was

11:37.034 --> 11:39.677
hurting his feelings or not. I was kind of 
concerned about that. But anyway, I played quite a

11:42.241 --> 11:46.447
bit my sophomore year. And in my junior year, I 
completely took over the point guard. And in my

11:51.034 --> 11:55.480
senior year, Marty Corot had got called up in the 
service. And Manning Smith was our coach. And

11:57.964 --> 11:58.845
Manning came to me. I was captain of the team. He 
said, Mike, I never played basketball. I never

12:04.014 --> 12:05.256
coached basketball. I don't think about it. I need 
help. I said, it's OK, coach. Here's our plays. And

12:09.002 --> 12:10.905
I diagrammed them for him. And we went over the 
roster and became acquainted. But it was a nice

12:16.033 --> 12:21.121
year of basketball for me. What were some of the 
favorite games that you have in your heart, in your

12:22.163 --> 12:25.448
memory? Kentucky and A&M. We were on a trip during 
the Christmas holiday. This was back in 42. We were

12:32.163 --> 12:35.586
on the way to the Madison Square Garden. We were 
going to play Oregon State in Madison Square

12:35.806 --> 12:39.149
Garden. And we started off playing

12:40.010 --> 12:45.836
LSU. Anyway we finally wind up playing Bradley 
Tech and we got to Kentucky and we played eight in

12:46.636 --> 12:53.282
Kentucky. Well at the half they were beating us 
pretty bad. And so the team rallied, and I was

12:56.990 --> 13:03.979
pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing. And it 
scared Adolph Rupp, the coach. Scared him, man.

13:10.347 --> 13:13.492
Going to get beat by that old college down in Texas. 
And so anyway, they beat us not bad but they beat us

13:20.092 --> 13:39.231
and after the game he went to shake manning smith's 
hand and he said no coach i want to shake that little

13:20.092 --> 13:39.231
bitty guy's hand he scared me i thought he was going 
to tear us up and so coach rupp came over to shut my

13:20.092 --> 13:39.231
hand i have not watched it since Oh yeah, that's a 
memorable memory for me. And playing in Madison

13:43.578 --> 13:45.821
Square Garden, who'd you all play? Oh, they 
canceled it. So we played Oregon State and

13:47.884 --> 13:53.012
Springfield, Illinois. Now did you make that trip 
on the train or on bus? On the train. On the train. We

13:56.457 --> 13:57.979
stayed on the Pullman. And about how many teams? It 
was ten of us. Ten? Yes, sir. And we all stayed on. We

14:08.103 --> 14:14.297
played Kentucky, LSU, Bradley Tech, Purdue. 
Piggy Lamberth was the co-chair. And then we swung

14:17.054 --> 14:22.584
around and played Oregon State and Springfield, 
Illinois. Then we swung around and played George

14:22.985 --> 14:25.510
Washington University. And then we'd come on 
home. I was going to tell you a story about Oh, we

14:31.135 --> 14:36.802
were playing SMU one day, one night, my senior 
year. And we were having a tough time with them. You

14:43.751 --> 14:47.876
know, we didn't have an outstanding club, but we 
had a good fighting bunch. And at the half, they

14:48.617 --> 14:53.984
were ahead of us about six points. And we rallied 
and played and played hard. And in fact, I made a

14:59.519 --> 15:04.105
couple of buckets. If you made more than six 
points, you were quite a scorer, you know. But I

15:09.272 --> 15:11.234
wasn't a scorer, I was a ball handler. And I played 
so hard, and we won the game, that I just sat down in

15:12.156 --> 15:17.823
the middle of the floor. I was just so tired. And 
here comes a coed out of the grandstand. and gives

15:23.870 --> 15:26.273
me a big hug and a kiss. Next morning, Dallas Times 
Herald, Darling of the Courts. And they had a

15:31.378 --> 15:32.440
picture of it. And the caption was, Darling of the 
Courts beat SMU. And that, you know, it was Bob

15:39.227 --> 15:43.272
Smith out of Houston's niece. Yeah. Did you get 
teased by your teammates? Oh yeah, they always

15:47.136 --> 15:49.098
called me Darling. Hey Darling, come on Darling. 
But it was all in fun.

15:55.899 --> 15:58.322
But we had a nice group. Marty Corot was called up 
and went to Corpus Christi on active duty and we

15:58.623 --> 16:08.216
played his team there at the Naval Station. And

16:09.377 --> 16:16.607
you were doing basketball strictly for fun, 
right? Did you ever get a full scholarship? Never

16:19.793 --> 16:20.414
did. I don't know why. So you continued to wait 
tables. Wait tables and do odd jobs around. And I

16:26.624 --> 16:32.433
don't know why I didn't make a demand since I was 
captain of the team to get a full scholarship. If

16:34.556 --> 16:42.969
y'all had a full muscle or a health problem, who 
took care of that while you were an athlete? We had a

16:43.109 --> 16:45.413
trainer named Little Demmon. I called him Bubba 
Little. He used to coach at Beaumont High School

16:47.985 --> 16:51.449
when I was there. And he was the trainer. If we had a 
big problem, we had to go to the hospital here. Dr.

16:56.374 --> 16:58.096
Marsh was the doctor. Very fine person. Describe 
your memory of Dr. Marsh. Oh, that rascal. He was,

17:03.743 --> 17:07.327
you know, he was much older than we were. But he got 
along great with the students. I got along good

17:11.591 --> 17:12.672
with him. And I never had any problems with him at 
all i mean any any medical problems let me say did

17:15.700 --> 17:39.480
y'all call it the quack shack no we didn't call it 
later that would be the nickname yeah i know that

17:15.700 --> 17:39.480
that's what they call the clinic here or something 
who was the when you got here who was the president a

17:15.700 --> 17:39.480
m president walton teal walton describe him Well 
he was, we didn't get, we weren't very much in touch

17:40.135 --> 17:44.944
with him. And I don't want to, he lived in the 
President's house which was behind dorm ten in the

17:45.886 --> 17:55.104
corps area. And he was pretty rough on the corps and 
stuff like that. And one of my roommates drowned

18:00.942 --> 18:07.318
him out through the window of his home. And of 
course, they caught him, suspended him, and told

18:07.398 --> 18:13.895
him they can never come back to A&M. But I think a 
year later, they let him be in there. Did you know

18:17.243 --> 18:18.485
the Gilchrists? Gib Gilchrist was president, I 
think, after Mr. Walton. And one year, I think, my

18:24.294 --> 18:27.058
senior year. All right. And then Henry was growing 
up on the campus. They got here, I think, in 37 or 38.

18:34.490 --> 18:37.594
and Henry was about ten, he told me, when he got 
here. Oh, really? So he would have been probably

18:38.355 --> 18:43.741
junior high, senior high when you got here. Let's 
see. Henry. Henry Gilchrist. Gilchrist, I see.

18:50.088 --> 18:50.409
The son. He's a lawyer in Dallas now. Yeah. Guyon 
Hall. Guyon Hall was a musical hall, theater hall.

19:00.160 --> 19:00.540
Yeah. Didn't have money. to go often, but when I did 
it was a treat. Oh yeah, Guy and Hall. Now I've heard

19:06.922 --> 19:12.768
that Aggies made noise during the movie 
sometimes, would cheer and laugh. If that comes

19:15.051 --> 19:15.872
later? That comes later. During those first, 
particularly that first year or two, how did you

19:18.955 --> 19:26.383
communicate with your parents? Did you all write 
letters? Did you call on the phone? Called

19:29.505 --> 19:29.886
letters. Never called on the phone. I don't recall 
calling on the phone. How often would you write?

19:34.733 --> 19:36.495
Write maybe at least once a week. And one weekend I 
came home, and I'd been home several times, and my

19:37.657 --> 19:46.469
mother says, come, Andrew doesn't come home. 
That's my brother. He was a freshman behind me. I

19:51.096 --> 19:53.299
said, well, Mama, he's studying. And I said, she 
said, well, I wanted him to come home. I hadn't seen

19:56.444 --> 19:57.205
him. I said, OK, Mama, we'll get him here. About the 
second month, we were in school. And I had been home

20:02.594 --> 20:04.077
a couple of times. The reason Andrew didn't get 
home, he was on a bull ring. Every weekend, he was

20:10.066 --> 20:11.889
here at A&M. So what happened? I said, Andrew, 
let's do this. I'm going to walk the bull ring for

20:16.837 --> 20:19.742
you. weekend and you go home and see mama." So he 
said, okay. So I get down to the bullring, which is

20:24.688 --> 20:30.655
held behind the petroleum building, geology 
building. They call it Coconose AP. I had my

20:33.058 --> 20:36.062
campaign hat on and I looked down, here sir. And 
they said, okay, and we start marching. The first

20:41.008 --> 20:42.209
hour went well. Then the second hour, here comes 
Captain Elwood, our professor of military

20:45.254 --> 20:50.621
science, Red Elwood. And he was watching us all, 
and he sent a sergeant over at the break, 10-minute

20:50.641 --> 21:01.515
break, and he said, go get Kokonos. I want to talk to 
him. So I get up in front of him, and I salute him and

21:03.037 --> 21:05.079
everything. And he says, what in the H-E-L-L-U 
doing on this bullring? He says, you don't have a

21:11.748 --> 21:15.216
demerit at all. I know. I've checked your record. I 
said, sir, my brother Andrew is walking in the pool

21:17.741 --> 21:23.955
and I'm walking in his place. Yeah, I know. So Mama 
hadn't seen him since he came in there in September

21:25.754 --> 21:30.902
and this was about November. And I said, Andrew, 
you go home and see Mama and I'll walk the bullring

21:31.543 --> 21:34.567
for you. He looked at me and he looked at me. Get back 
in line. That's all he said. But he turned out to be

21:39.915 --> 21:46.024
one of my finest friends and my mentor here at A&M. 
He came to every basketball game. He hollered for

21:48.087 --> 21:51.392
me at every play and every time I got the ball. And he 
taught me how to fire field artillery weapons as a

21:56.433 --> 22:00.066
forward observer that I used in combat. And I 
really have a very dear spot in my heart for Well,

22:06.929 --> 22:08.952
Colonel Elwood, when he left here. Because he and I 
were very good friends. All right. And you

22:15.562 --> 22:17.626
mentioned combat. Let's go back. You got here as a 
freshman almost exactly when the war began in

22:19.208 --> 22:25.758
Europe in the fall of 1939. That's right. Did you 
and your buddies, did you all start talking much

22:27.601 --> 22:32.046
about the war in Europe? Never said anything about 
it. We didn't even consider it. When I came to A&M, I

22:35.230 --> 22:38.434
couldn't do right face from left face. I didn't 
know what military was really. But I learned

22:42.459 --> 22:44.841
pretty quick. What hurt us more, and I say us 
because it involves the basketball team, In

22:51.766 --> 23:07.023
December of 41, we were practicing basketball and 
December 7, Coach Corot, I think it was a Sunday,

22:51.766 --> 23:07.023
called us all in the middle of the floor of D-Ware 
Gym. He said, sit down fellas, I got something to

23:07.824 --> 23:09.906
tell you. He said, Pearl Harbor was attacked by the 
Japanese and we're at war. And would you believe

23:15.973 --> 23:17.635
it? It wasn't a dry eye in the bunch. They all were so 
mad and so hit hard by that that Coach Corot

23:20.504 --> 23:30.581
canceled the basketball practice and said come 
back Monday and we'll practice and sent us home.

23:32.164 --> 23:38.675
What did you and, when you and your buddies as you 
went into the shower and went back to your room,

23:32.164 --> 23:38.675
what were you all saying to each other? Not much. We 
were really solemn. We didn't know what to say.

23:42.762 --> 23:44.065
Didn't know what to do, really. But we knew if we 
stayed at A&M, we'd be trained to go wherever they

23:44.446 --> 23:50.480
wanted us to go. And so we didn't say much. There 
wasn't any big discussion. They were all mad at the

23:55.070 --> 23:58.999
Japs for what they did. As a history teacher, I can 
tell you that one of the now amusing things is to

24:00.194 --> 24:10.332
have a student ask, well, what about the opponents 
of the war? We always tell them, there were none.

24:14.139 --> 24:14.800
There were none. And did some of your 
acquaintances leave quickly? Yeah some of them

24:20.630 --> 24:22.154
did leave. They joined up, they went to Canada and 
joined the Air Force. But most of them stayed here.

24:29.531 --> 24:38.352
And then we thought we were going to get our 
commission and be commissioned as second

24:29.531 --> 24:38.352
lieutenant, like they had done the other classes. 
But they didn't do that to our class. We went to

24:40.892 --> 24:49.384
school 12 months out of the year, and we didn't go to 
that summer training, six-week training. That's

24:49.784 --> 24:52.107
where you get your commission and everything. 
Now, had you gone to, after your freshman year,

24:52.127 --> 24:56.513
let's back up. After your freshman year, what did 
you do that summer? Did you go to summer camp after

24:59.718 --> 25:02.361
your freshman year? No, sir. You went back to 
Beaumont? Went back to Beaumont and went to work.

25:05.426 --> 25:07.849
What did you do? Worked out the mobile oil 
refinery. Good job. Yeah, it was a water bar. But

25:15.018 --> 25:15.879
they wouldn't keep it. They wouldn't keep us. And 
then next summer I worked for a pure oil company

25:17.942 --> 25:27.273
working on the labor gang out at Port Natchez. And 
academically, how were you doing here? Average. I

25:33.970 --> 25:39.236
wasn't the brightest thing that came to A&M, but I 
was average. And you changed your major from

25:39.596 --> 25:41.999
pre-med? From engineering to pre-med. Oh, you 
changed from engineering to pre-med. Yes, sir.

25:47.205 --> 25:50.108
And did you really think you were going to go to 
medical school? I really thought I would go to

25:50.388 --> 25:52.290
medical school. I sure did. Who did you turn to for 
academic advice? what to take and what

25:56.935 --> 26:01.112
instructors. Who did you... You see, my advisor at 
the time

26:08.782 --> 26:10.704
I didn't seek his advice. He didn't ask me either. 
He didn't call me in. I was trying to think of the

26:14.268 --> 26:19.875
prof's name in the biology department, a little 
short fellow. Anyway I visited with him and he told

26:20.615 --> 26:28.464
me what courses to take like genetics and 
histology and comparative anatomy. But it was

26:28.925 --> 26:30.807
pretty well spelled out. Take all the chemistry 
there was. I took every chemistry course they had.

26:36.271 --> 26:45.146
And I could have got a degree in chemistry if I'd 
have taken calculus or thermodynamics or

26:36.271 --> 26:45.146
something like that, but I wasn't very good at 
math, and so I avoided it. But I really didn't seek

26:47.349 --> 26:50.675
anybody. I just followed the course at A&M and sat 
down for pre-med. Now, did you turn to an older

26:53.920 --> 26:56.845
brother for advice sometimes? Yeah, my older 
brother was the one that talked me into taking

26:57.989 --> 27:05.201
engineering, which I didn't want to do it, so I 
didn't talk to him anymore.

27:08.727 --> 27:13.395
You mentioned baptism a while ago, baptism in the 
Greek Orthodox Church. Yes, sir. Is that the

27:14.857 --> 27:18.263
church you, did you attend Greek Orthodox back in 
Beaumont? Back in Beaumont, yes. All right, now

27:19.144 --> 27:21.909
when you came up here, what did you do on Sundays? I 
went to the Episcopalian Church. down on behind

27:24.702 --> 27:26.605
Duncan Hall. Right over here. Right over here, 
yes, sir. And I was a lay reader. Did the typical

27:30.972 --> 27:34.077
Aggie go to church in those days? Yes, they did.

27:37.943 --> 27:43.451
Two or three of us used to march across the field 
behind Duncan Hall and go to church together. In

27:43.691 --> 27:48.519
fact, Reverend Houser was the priest, the pastor, 
and he's a handball player. So I'm a handball

27:48.980 --> 27:50.161
player. So we got acquainted real quick. good and 
bonded and so I went for four years. Where did you

27:57.790 --> 27:59.694
play handball? Behind DeWare Gym. Outdoors? No 
sir. Oh in a little? In a little shack behind it and

28:04.365 --> 28:08.715
the roof was The ceiling was made of chicken wire, 
so you couldn't get a ceiling shot. You familiar

28:13.783 --> 28:14.784
with handball? I play handball today. Hey, that's 
why you're in good shape. Yes, sir. I hope so.

28:23.898 --> 28:27.102
Describe the religious activities on the campus. 
Was there a religious emphasis week then in the

28:27.223 --> 28:31.028
spring? They had them, but they weren't 
publicized very much. We didn't have the chapel

28:33.732 --> 28:36.897
like they have here now. My other roommate, Bobby 
Woodham, was a Baptist, and he went to the Baptist

28:37.501 --> 28:47.274
church, and I went with him a couple of times just to 
accommodate him. And the same Catholic church

28:47.915 --> 28:55.165
outside of Bryan, what is it, St. Joseph? St. 
Joseph. They were the only Catholic church I can

28:56.747 --> 29:01.534
remember. Well, normally the cadets kept to 
themselves about their religion. Now, the fact

29:08.586 --> 29:15.694
that you were of Greek ancestry, did that ever, did 
anybody ever tease you about that? No, sir. Never

29:16.675 --> 29:17.135
did. And describe the variety of acquaintances 
you had here as to where they came from and what

29:17.936 --> 29:25.404
their family did. Well, one of my Battery Mates was 
Cantu, Peter Cantu. He was from San Antonio and his

29:31.917 --> 29:44.447
family

29:31.917 --> 29:44.447
had a grocery store if I'm not mistaken.

29:44.427 --> 29:56.179
Normally,

29:44.427 --> 29:56.179
generally, Cadet Corps was a great mixture of 
different religion, different nationality, and

29:44.427 --> 29:56.179
no one ever questioned. No one. Like, did you know 
some Jewish boys? Oh, yeah. Bob Epstein, and I knew

30:01.224 --> 30:14.097
some Italian boys named Cantina from Galveston, 
Novelli, and some Jewish. But we were all friends.

30:15.762 --> 30:16.724
No one ever questioned. Were any of those Japanese 
American boys from Orange County here when you

30:17.124 --> 30:23.015
were here? Oh, Kishi. No, they were before my time. 
They were rice farmers down in Viter, Texas,

30:27.363 --> 30:30.309
Orange County. That's correct. Got a good memory, 
Dr. Monroe. Let's see.

30:39.743 --> 30:44.522
When the war started, did everything become more 
serious on campus? I can't say that it was a change

30:46.898 --> 30:57.009
of pace or anything like that because to me A&M was 
always a serious situation you know. There wasn't

30:57.029 --> 31:10.763
no hell raising much and silver taps just sobered 
you up so quickly and made you realize that life is

30:57.029 --> 31:10.763
so precious you know.

31:10.743 --> 31:22.041
Yeah, the activity has begun to pick up in the 
military and fellows, classmates were leaving

31:10.743 --> 31:22.041
before they finished the semester. Did all of 
y'all take Silver Tap seriously? Yes, sir. That

31:26.387 --> 31:29.072
was the most serious thing that was on this campus. 
Today, I can tell you
