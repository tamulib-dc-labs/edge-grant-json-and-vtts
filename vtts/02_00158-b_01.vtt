WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:10.870
We had another young man in his band named Boyd 
Rabin. And actually, the dance was over. One of the

00:13.293 --> 00:19.580
other band members, his girlfriend was going 
riding around. And Rabin went along, and I went

00:20.321 --> 00:22.784
along. He said he had David with the band.

00:30.423 --> 00:31.244
What was he like? Describe him. He was a young man, 
probably early 30s. He had a good band, but you

00:36.571 --> 00:41.237
didn't hear much of it. He hadn't gotten up to the 
top yet. Did Glenn Miller come here during your

00:44.541 --> 00:47.144
time? I believe he was here one time. But we had very 
good bands coming here. But not often, because

00:55.955 --> 00:59.940
mainly the people who wanted to get What

01:00.275 --> 01:15.596
were the biggest dances on the campus that

01:00.275 --> 01:15.596
y'all did? Did

01:15.877 --> 01:28.915
y'all do the cotton ball?

01:33.704 --> 02:02.715
what about ring dances or boot

01:33.704 --> 02:02.715
the

01:33.704 --> 02:02.715
during

01:33.704 --> 02:02.715
during this time who was the president

01:33.704 --> 02:02.715
gilchrist yet or was he dean bolton the president 
Bear

02:03.505 --> 02:08.810
tracks both of them? I didn't know that. He had big 
feet.

02:14.055 --> 02:16.017
Did you all see the president much? No. I don't 
think he attended.

02:22.844 --> 02:28.609
When you and your buddies wanted to have a good 
time, where did you go and what did you all do? We

02:29.570 --> 02:30.531
went out to Edmond. Thank you. Describe his place. 
Well, there was a frame building. But the main

02:39.909 --> 02:44.276
attraction was the bar. You'd get off campus in 
order to drink beer. You didn't have much money to

02:48.383 --> 02:53.411
drink beer, but we'd go out there and have it 
fraternized. It's the guy that we had to walk from

02:53.431 --> 02:58.740
the campus down the edge, and it was right away. 
What was the favorite brand of beer that you all

02:59.176 --> 03:03.803
drank? Grand Prize, Southern Select? Grand 
Prize, and what was that other one? Southern

03:10.454 --> 03:11.856
Select? Yeah, that was one of them. I had forgotten 
that name, but it was Budweiser. Oh, sure. Yeah,

03:21.431 --> 03:24.797
but some of the beers were cheaper than others, 
were they not? You probably drank the cheap beers.

03:27.610 --> 03:31.517
I don't recall ever getting bruised off out there. 
They just went out there just for the company, you

03:31.537 --> 03:35.024
know. And most people walked. Right. Did you and 
your buddies ever go out to the clay pits swimming?

03:45.964 --> 03:51.694
I didn't go out there, but I know there's a lot of 
guys that did go out there to the clay pits. Was

03:53.716 --> 03:58.082
there a bootlegger anywhere around that anybody 
knew about? I don't remember one. Did any of the

04:02.028 --> 04:07.696
guys in the project house ever have beer or whiskey 
in their room? No. No, there was a clean place. We

04:11.662 --> 04:13.624
didn't bring anything in there. Was it okay to 
smoke in the room? It seemed like I don't ever

04:15.727 --> 04:20.895
remember having to go outside to smoke. I don't 
know. I know there was maybe one or two guys in my

04:22.302 --> 04:28.349
room that smoked. Where did y'all go for a movie? 
Oh, at the campus. DeGuyen Hall? DeGuyen Hall? No,

04:38.882 --> 04:40.844
not very often. I don't recall that they had 
movies.

04:47.532 --> 04:47.873
Oh, I'm sorry. You mean the campus theater? Yeah. 
Yes, yes. Yeah.

04:54.230 --> 04:57.834
They're not doing movies. They're doing country 
music. That's a big thing nowadays. That's where

05:04.002 --> 05:07.586
we used to go to see a movie. Do you remember where 
you were on December 7, 1941? Yes. Please describe

05:14.674 --> 05:17.337
that. That was Sunday. And we didn't go to church 
that day. We were just lounging around in the rooms

05:21.719 --> 05:24.904
and everything. Some guys had this radio on and 
there was great excitement about the bombing of

05:26.247 --> 05:33.218
Pearl Harbor.

05:36.384 --> 05:40.791
I was listening to that thing and I went down the 
hall and I said, well, we're into it now. And I knew

05:42.256 --> 05:47.463
then that we were involved in a big war. And I'm sure 
we all were pretty silent and listening to the news

05:48.504 --> 05:59.659
and being really scared, I guess you might say. 
Although it wasn't frightening per se, but it was

05:59.819 --> 06:07.970
solemn, one of the solemn things. We are now 
involved in it. And then I said to these guys, Well,

06:12.074 --> 06:13.456
we're into it now. Because, you know, there's been 
a lot of, not a lot, but reluctance for the United

06:14.398 --> 06:20.869
States to get into this business. But we didn't 
have any choice after that happened. And so, I

06:24.515 --> 06:34.813
guess that kind

06:24.515 --> 06:34.813
of determined my future, you know, more or less. 
People thought I was reneging on military things

06:37.792 --> 06:47.027
because here I am, 30 years old, and wearing 
civilian clothes. And that was one of the

06:47.047 --> 06:51.514
influences in putting me into service in 1942. 
Now, did you volunteer? Yes. I volunteered, but I

06:55.801 --> 06:57.744
wanted to join the Navy. I don't know why. I just 
thought it was romantic, and I had some friends who

07:00.950 --> 07:04.896
were in the Navy. But they weren't taking any 
volunteers. So I really did the best thing not

07:09.356 --> 07:15.384
going into the Navy when I volunteered with the Air 
Force. And they had no trouble taking me there.

07:18.167 --> 07:19.469
Now, when did you sign up? Do you remember? October 
1942. October 1942. So you had finished two full

07:24.074 --> 07:27.038
years. Did you go here in the summer of 1942? Yes, I 
did. And I had signed up. to go to the fall. Things

07:35.820 --> 07:38.283
were in a turmoil. Nothing was the same as it was 
before. I mean, I didn't know whether the band

07:42.649 --> 07:45.573
would continue or not. And people were, men were 
leaving by the door being either drafted or going

07:45.613 --> 07:55.186
for some reason other than maybe because of the 
military. That's the kind of turmoil. And you get

08:00.631 --> 08:04.818
involved in that kind of thing. And you wonder why, 
well, what am I going to do about this thing? And I'd

08:08.964 --> 08:12.390
say, well, how do you stand out of the service? 
Well, that was one of the reasons why I

08:12.410 --> 08:16.897
volunteered. Another reason was I just got picked 
up in it. And I told my mother that I was

08:20.182 --> 08:22.847
volunteering. She said, you were too old to go to 
the military. I said, well.

08:29.842 --> 08:33.547
And where did you go to enlist? I went to Waco.

08:38.354 --> 08:44.724
I can't pull up these boards.

08:44.784 --> 08:52.575
I went up there and volunteered. And they sent me up 
to Dallas.

08:59.266 --> 09:00.868
They involved you. They signed you up. And you were 
sent back.

09:11.919 --> 09:16.063
I was sent back to Waco. I worked in a state in 
Dallas. Not too many days. I know there's a bunch of

09:17.085 --> 09:18.546
us here in Oregon.

09:22.205 --> 09:26.110
And I ended up at Mineral Wells, one of the places 
out there. And then they sent me back to Waco. And I

09:29.314 --> 09:35.922
stayed in Waco, this was October when I went in, and 
I stayed in Waco until February. And then I was

09:36.643 --> 09:43.832
enrolled in an Air Corps maintenance thing. And 
they sent me to Nebraska, to the Nebraska Air Base

09:43.852 --> 09:50.440
up there for training as a mechanic. And thence, 
from there I was shipped to California and

09:51.938 --> 10:01.729
assigned to a group in the 363rd Fighter Group. 
From there I ended up in Europe.

10:09.798 --> 10:20.410
These years are most impressive to me because I was 
involved in the thing.

10:21.267 --> 10:24.171
involved in maintenance to a fighter. What kind of 
fighters were in your squad? B-51. B-51? And that

10:28.638 --> 10:29.840
was the big. Mustangs. Yeah, that was the big 
fighter thing in the big area. They had the 47s and

10:35.709 --> 10:40.516
they had the 51s, and they both were fighter 
things. But if anything, the 51 was probably a

10:41.097 --> 10:49.570
superior product because it had the speed of 750 
miles an hour. When the war started, you said

10:51.187 --> 10:56.912
things changed around here. Describe how it 
changed. How did attitudes change among the

10:59.214 --> 11:02.237
students? Everybody was excited. You know, and it 
felt like everything you did, you had to do in a

11:04.439 --> 11:10.865
hurry. And you go here, and I had already signed up 
for classes. And I'd gone to some classes, but I had

11:15.289 --> 11:20.113
to go to the... When

11:20.515 --> 11:38.473
the war started, who did you and your friends think 
was going to win the war? Do

11:39.434 --> 11:46.742
you remember anybody arguing against? No. It 
seemed like You know, everybody was into the

11:50.806 --> 12:00.878
thing, and they went into it voluntarily, so to 
speak. Well, everybody was really . You know, the

12:03.941 --> 12:06.784
Japanese were doing something like that. And so we 
. Everybody,

12:09.247 --> 12:17.557
I don't remember anybody ever objecting to it. 
Now, during that second, your sophomore year

12:17.577 --> 12:20.560
here, though, when the war started, the Aggieland 
Orchestra is still going strong. Did some of the

12:26.341 --> 12:29.284
members of the orchestra leave early? I think some 
of them did, but I think I was the first one that they

12:29.825 --> 12:35.171
called. But I'm sure that some of the other two were 
in the military out at A&M. They probably called

12:39.315 --> 12:40.336
up. Did you all change your repertoire when the war 
started? Did you all play some different songs?

12:47.384 --> 12:50.007
Well, some of them we did. Some

12:51.067 --> 12:58.153
of those English

12:51.067 --> 12:58.153
songs. White Cliffs of Dover. That's the one I was 
trying to think of. And the one about the

13:03.338 --> 13:05.140
Mockingbird Sands. On Blueberry Hill. No, but 
that was another one. Blueberry Hill. The

13:12.146 --> 13:15.229
Mockingbird Sands. On some street. And there was 
about four or five of those songs that were being

13:16.550 --> 13:19.673
popularized. I'll be seeing you.

13:25.116 --> 13:43.095
We lost contact with one strong in the United

13:25.116 --> 13:43.095
States.

13:44.036 --> 13:49.862
During that second year here, did any of the 
faculty leave, faculty and staff? I don't

13:50.146 --> 13:53.631
remember whether it was or not. Of course, you 
know, you didn't know very many of the staff I was

13:53.651 --> 13:59.500
working with. And I think I was probably one of the 
first ones to pay off, so I don't know who left that

13:59.520 --> 14:06.731
job. They had that movie made here, you know, that 
stuff. Was that while you were here? No, it was

14:11.538 --> 14:13.141
after I left. Oh, boy. Oh, I was hoping that you 
would have recalled that. I said it. We've never

14:18.479 --> 14:20.041
been whipped, I think. Never been licked. Never 
been licked. They said that really changed the

14:23.406 --> 14:27.192
campus. Cables running here and there and all that 
stuff. Now, you came back here then after the war.

14:35.244 --> 14:35.444
Yes. When did you get back? I got out of service 
September of 1945. And I didn't realize it, but I

14:42.205 --> 14:52.554
could come

14:42.205 --> 14:52.554
back to A&M. I thought,

14:52.574 --> 15:05.926
well, I've got

14:52.574 --> 15:05.926
time on my hands. I could count the year that, you 
know, the student year that I started. So before I

15:07.388 --> 15:08.889
decided to leave the military, I was at home. I told 
my mother, she was going to be 30 or something like

15:08.909 --> 15:10.190
that. I thought I was going to stay in the military, 
stay in the Air Force. She said, well, I hope you do.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.747
college education. And so I

15:17.787 --> 15:34.453
didn't know really what I wanted to do, but I went 
back and I said I couldn't get into school now, but I

15:17.787 --> 15:34.453
got out of the military just in time to get enrolled 
in the fall semester.

15:40.053 --> 16:08.912
And

15:40.053 --> 16:08.912
how... How had your attitude

16:09.247 --> 16:21.985
about college,

16:09.247 --> 16:21.985
how has it changed by the years? Well, I guess not 
many of them. The military gave you

16:26.331 --> 16:32.740
$69. But were you more determined? Well, I was more 
into it.

16:45.323 --> 16:52.016
Oh

16:45.323 --> 16:52.016
yeah, I made better grades. I was older. What was 
your major? What were you dreaming of doing with

16:52.718 --> 16:55.403
that degree? Thank

16:56.041 --> 17:09.325
you. ... ... ...

17:10.013 --> 17:29.845
... ... ...

17:30.044 --> 17:42.585
Thank

17:30.044 --> 17:42.585
you. And

17:43.949 --> 18:08.282
where did you live? Did you play in the orchestra 
again? Well,

18:10.510 --> 18:31.952
it's pretty much the same as something he made. 
Before, the management of the Arc Park Center

18:31.972 --> 18:33.714
didn't have a steering director. But they got a man 
named Bill Stringer. I don't know if he's on that

18:34.535 --> 18:35.496
page on the campus. He was either head or director 
of Agri. And they didn't have a director. Mr.

18:38.168 --> 18:57.309
Turner, was he a faculty member? I think that he 
was. San

18:59.482 --> 19:27.226
Luis, Texas, and San Marcos? No, no, it's the one up 
at East Texas. East Texas? Yeah. Yeah. When was

19:28.507 --> 19:28.787
that? After you left? Yeah. Mr.

19:29.468 --> 19:49.502
Turner here, did

19:29.468 --> 19:49.502
he conduct the Aggieland Orchestra? Did

19:50.579 --> 20:01.091
the instrumentation change after the war?

20:05.216 --> 20:07.919
The big band there was dying. And the big band, you 
couldn't afford them. And they just didn't get out

20:13.285 --> 20:16.629
and threw around like they used to do. We didn't get 
to bring any of them down here. Did you all get paid

20:19.300 --> 20:23.906
when you, were you still getting paid cash when you 
did play? Yes, I was. Do you remember what the pay

20:25.148 --> 20:26.990
was after the war? No, I sure don't. I didn't depend 
on that as much because I had the GI Bill. But that

20:35.361 --> 20:41.709
didn't cut it either anymore because of the higher 
costs and everything. Now, back before the war,

20:41.729 --> 20:47.977
did someone conduct the orchestra or did you all 
just play together? We just played together. and

20:50.958 --> 21:19.007
uh... after the war or most of the concerts uh... 
most y'all played mostly on-campus didn't travel

20:50.958 --> 21:19.007
marley or really how did you travel thing but 
there's more more read well the same as it was

20:50.958 --> 21:19.007
before things under different hospices her still 
an employee of the university

21:19.274 --> 21:39.561
You

21:19.274 --> 21:39.561
said that you didn't read music much. Do

21:39.980 --> 22:07.827
you remember any tune that was very difficult for 
you to... to learn and one that was very easy. What

22:11.269 --> 22:24.569
was the easiest

22:11.269 --> 22:24.569
or the hardest? Well, the hardest one was . Those 
were easy?

22:31.700 --> 22:31.800
Yeah. . I

22:32.680 --> 22:58.118
think most of them are students who had not gotten 
involved. Were they newcomers? Some of them were.

23:01.064 --> 23:01.845
Yes, they were. I'd say that maybe 50% were new. Who 
was your closest Aggieland Orchestra friend?

23:11.198 --> 23:12.640
Well, I guess Murray Evans. Murray Evans? Yeah, 
the guitar. He was the man that got me down here. Of

23:17.868 --> 23:21.212
course, he was graduated, I think, well before I 
did. And there was several of those guys. Where was

23:24.036 --> 23:24.717
he from? He was from McKinney. Okay. We were both 
from McKinney. And then after the war, you were the

23:29.448 --> 23:32.891
oldest man in the group? I'm sure. Did they look to 
you for advice? No. They're pretty independent

23:38.636 --> 23:39.977
people. All right. After the war, how different 
was the behavior pattern of the students? They

23:49.305 --> 23:49.965
did. They did? Because, you know, the enlisted man 
was not allowed to drink in the service. You did not

23:59.249 --> 24:13.366
get any quota, you know, like the, where the 
aviators or other people with rank, you know, they

23:59.249 --> 24:13.366
were issued overseas, they were issued drinks. 
And some of them, sometimes they would give their

24:14.567 --> 24:22.636
drinks, you know, some of them didn't drink, 
they'd give it to their people who were under them.

24:22.656 --> 24:24.298
So some drinking in the service. Of course, if you 
got off to London, or Paris or someplace, you know.

24:31.889 --> 24:33.831
Then you let your hair down, you know. But back on 
the campus, there was no control, and you could buy

24:35.132 --> 24:40.918
all the whiskey you wanted, you could do anything. 
Well, we didn't drink a lot. I didn't drink a lot,

24:43.981 --> 24:45.763
but I drank. You may not want to put this on, but 
there was a group of people in Bryan who were

24:47.425 --> 24:54.872
civilians

24:57.147 --> 25:04.615
They'd bring drinks out there, and we'd all go out 
and sit under a tree and shoot the bull, you know,

24:57.147 --> 25:04.615
and have a few. All right, now, was this beer or 
whiskey? Mostly beer. Beer. Now, was Whiskey

25:08.879 --> 25:12.002
Bridge yet operating? Drove out towards Snook 
just beyond the... Yeah. Yeah, that's where the

25:16.227 --> 25:18.629
whiskey was bought. You know, this was a dry 
county. Right. We used to go out on Friday, drive

25:21.032 --> 25:26.057
out and get a pint or a quart or something, you know, 
and we'd... Now, so Uncle Ed's was there before the

25:26.510 --> 25:32.536
war, but there also after the war. I don't remember 
ever going to Uncle Ed's after the war. I remember,

25:36.159 --> 25:39.002
let me think about this. Well, I believe it was 
still there because I was involved with a young

25:40.863 --> 25:46.969
lady from out of Waco. And one time her parents 
brought her down for a dance or something. And we

25:52.794 --> 25:55.757
would probably have another band in at the end, you 
know. But anyway, I can remember she and I

25:56.260 --> 25:59.964
hitchhiked down to the edge one day. So I'm sure he 
was still out there by that time.

26:07.893 --> 26:11.977
On the south edge of the campus, the project houses 
were filled with veterans. And were there lots of

26:12.698 --> 26:15.001
trailers there also? I don't remember the 
trailers. But, you know, they converted it, you

26:16.823 --> 26:23.550
know, to quarters for married students, you know. 
So they lived in the project houses.

26:28.811 --> 26:31.614
What did the married students' wives, what did 
they do? Did they work around? I think some of them

26:32.856 --> 26:37.221
did, but I don't recall anything in particular. Of 
course, they kind of had their own cliques, you

26:38.463 --> 26:43.389
know, the married students did. And we didn't 
fraternize, you know, with them very much, or know

26:44.390 --> 26:48.896
them, for that matter. What did you and your 
buddies think about the Aggie band? Oh, we loved

26:54.023 --> 26:56.345
it. Of course, we had, nobody didn't have to, but, 
you know, we got a lot of members of the bands in the

26:56.385 --> 27:03.953
orchestra. I see. Several of the trumpet band, and 
I know that maybe it might have been, say, 60% of the

27:05.214 --> 27:15.084
Aggieland Orchestra were band members. Of 
course, they had the advantage of being good

27:16.425 --> 27:21.550
musicians, you know, and they were, they were 
chosen. from out of the band to play in the

27:22.272 --> 27:24.975
orchestra. And let's see, every instrument y'all 
had except the piano, the band... I don't think the

27:32.121 --> 27:34.063
band furnished them. No, no, I mean, but those 
instruments, the people could play those

27:34.203 --> 27:41.110
instruments in the marching band. Oh, yes. Yeah, 
they got those guys from over there who probably

27:42.851 --> 27:49.157
maybe had had orchestra experience somewhere in 
their civilian life. When you came back from the

27:54.490 --> 28:00.359
war, describe going to an Aggie football game. How 
did things change

28:00.619 --> 28:05.887
before the war and after the war? I'm sorry to say, 
but I was not much of a football man. So I don't know

28:12.762 --> 28:16.326
whether it would be any difference or not. Of 
course, you know, the Corps has always supported

28:17.247 --> 28:23.174
athletic things, pretty much. I was not in the 
Corps either time, so I guess I didn't get that, you

28:23.615 --> 28:32.025
know, I don't know what you call it. As far as you 
were aware, what student officials corps

28:41.416 --> 28:43.859
commander, band commander, whatever. What 
student leaders had the highest prestige? Well,

28:49.247 --> 28:59.061
of course, the military was pretty... Now, at one 
time, after I was graduated, I went to work in the

28:49.247 --> 28:59.061
military department over there keeping records. 
Oh, really? Yeah. But they didn't pay. Meantime, I

29:01.745 --> 29:02.967
had gotten married. And I couldn't feed a wife 
on... the records keeper's salary, so that's when

29:07.319 --> 29:11.866
I left A&M. All right. When did you start going 
steady with this future wife? Was it while you were

29:17.173 --> 29:18.275
a student? Yes. How did you meet? Oh, let's see. We 
were downtown. No, I guess the first time I met her,

29:24.804 --> 29:34.238
I was going to Caldwell on the bus, and she was going 
to Giddings on the bus, and that's when I met her.

29:35.399 --> 29:40.506
And then I found out that she worked at the fiscal 
department. At that time, she'd been working over

29:40.767 --> 29:43.030
there for a couple of years. And I used to meet her at 
lunch, you know, at the cafe. She'd come over to

29:47.897 --> 29:50.781
cafes on the north side for lunch. What cafe? Where 
would you all meet? I don't remember the names of

29:54.707 --> 29:58.352
them, but they were right along in that. right 
across from the post office there. They changed

30:00.921 --> 30:07.831
the names, you know, and it'd be one name this time, 
the next time you went, somebody else owned it. But

30:08.773 --> 30:13.700
we used to go over there, and I'd beat her over 
there, and we'd have lunch together. When you went

30:14.561 --> 30:16.544
out on date, where did you go? To the Boogamies. 
There wasn't very much to do, you know, around

30:20.069 --> 30:22.112
here. Campus or downtown? Downtown. She lived 
with her sister and brother-in-law down on East

30:24.561 --> 30:32.817
29th Street. Which was the best movie downtown? 
The Palace. And then, of course, they had the

30:38.900 --> 30:40.602
Queen. And another, I don't remember what that 
other name was, but they were all owned by the same

30:40.662 --> 30:47.933
people. The Shieldmans, I think. Yes. Yeah, Bill 
Shieldman. Did you have a car by that time? No, I

30:54.001 --> 30:54.802
didn't. I didn't get a car until after I went into 
the insurance business. Well, how did you all get

30:57.646 --> 31:01.993
around when you were seeing her? Well, we had a bus. 
Okay. We had a bus to get into town. Okay. She'd

31:06.254 --> 31:13.425
either come out here and we'd louse around on the 
campus or else we'd, you know, various places, yak

31:06.254 --> 31:13.425
and, you know. Did y'all go to dances? Yes, uh-huh. 
Occasionally, when sometime a big band had come

31:18.093 --> 31:21.238
into town. Having been in the orchestra, 
sometimes I didn't have to pay. Uh-huh. Let's see.

31:31.713 --> 31:38.107
One of the questions I should have asked earlier, 
when you were a student, did you attend any

31:31.713 --> 31:38.107
religious services here? We used to go to church 
over at First Baptist Church in College State.
