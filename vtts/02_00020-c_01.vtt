WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:15.231
We know that students who have been involved in the traditions and the culture of the institution, they succeed better, they donate more back to the institution, all of those kinds of things.

00:16.453 --> 00:22.765
I think all the camaraderie is just hard to measure how important it is.

00:24.095 --> 00:26.700
calling every name at commencement and shaking every hand?

00:26.841 --> 00:26.921
Yes.

00:27.342 --> 00:30.568
Yeah, that's personalization in an impersonal time.

00:31.029 --> 00:31.650
It really is.

00:32.612 --> 00:34.897
Let's see, trying to think of some goofy.

00:35.177 --> 00:35.578
Yeah.

00:35.598 --> 00:41.530
Do you remember any examples of where somebody misunderstood the advice they'd received here?

00:41.510 --> 00:42.551
Oh, goodness.

00:43.352 --> 00:49.357
And did something that was completely contrary to what, but I thought you told me to do this, that, or the other?

00:49.678 --> 00:51.279
Well, let me correct something.

00:51.579 --> 00:53.962
I've noticed you've used the word advice a number of times.

00:54.562 --> 00:56.063
And we don't do that, actually.

00:57.365 --> 00:59.967
We honestly don't.

01:00.668 --> 01:03.931
Well, there's several premise, you know, that first of all, we're all fallible.

01:04.231 --> 01:09.576
And what we really try to do is make counseling a learning experience in that we

01:10.012 --> 01:16.280
We really try to help people understand better what their problem situation is.

01:16.360 --> 01:24.771
Sometimes people only have a 60% understanding of the nuances of what's lurking under that problem.

01:25.452 --> 01:32.541
So we really try to illuminate all of the features of a problem area so a person has a comprehensive understanding.

01:33.061 --> 01:36.846
And then what you do is you're really trying to

01:37.568 --> 01:41.614
get an idea what their thoughts and feelings are about it, and then what their options are.

01:42.315 --> 01:47.663
And we know in similar problem situations, option A may be good for one student, option D may be good for another.

01:48.324 --> 02:03.087
And then what we try to do is once we make them rigorously ferret out what's best for them in terms of the consequences, then we work at supporting them in beginning to change their behavior and act on that plan.

02:04.079 --> 02:08.308
But we don't select the plan for them or advise them in a certain way.

02:08.689 --> 02:11.796
And the whole idea is they're the ones who have to make the change.

02:11.876 --> 02:16.165
They're the ones who suffer the consequences of changing something.

02:16.550 --> 02:19.493
And we don't have to live inside their skin if it goes badly.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.055
So we're real careful.

02:21.855 --> 02:31.425
A good example is we get students from alcoholic families where alcohol is a major player in family life and there are issues the family never talks about.

02:31.786 --> 02:34.648
Call them like the dead elephants laying in the living room.

02:34.729 --> 02:36.490
Everybody walks around them.

02:36.510 --> 02:41.275
And students will come here and they learn to relate in odd ways then.

02:41.736 --> 02:44.839
And then they try to do it here at A&M and it's not working for them.

02:44.859 --> 02:46.000
And that brings them in.

02:46.503 --> 02:55.693
And then you find that out and they finally say, I'm going to really start talking to my family about all this alcohol abuse and what it's doing to our family.

02:56.254 --> 03:09.228
Well, I'll tell you, you get into a sick family scenario and all of the people who are participants in that sick family will work very hard to put you back into your former role and not allow this to happen.

03:09.328 --> 03:13.152
So that's where the support of students becomes so important.

03:13.756 --> 03:14.697
We don't advise them.

03:14.717 --> 03:20.985
I mean, obviously, if they say, well, I think the way for me to solve this is to kill myself, we're naturally going to have an opinion about that.

03:21.566 --> 03:25.610
But we really try to help people work through and think through.

03:25.651 --> 03:38.346
The idea is that the next problem they come up against, hopefully they can use that as a learning experience to handle themselves, as opposed to having come back to us and say, well, what do you advise me to do this time, you know?

03:38.765 --> 03:41.729
We don't want to make people dependent, so that's kind of the philosophy.

03:41.769 --> 03:47.016
How often does a parent say thank you?

03:47.337 --> 03:48.098
Periodically.

03:48.398 --> 03:49.179
Periodically.

03:51.743 --> 04:00.655
We have an interesting relationship with parents because we want to respond to them

04:01.732 --> 04:19.675
in ways that we would want to be responded to if we were a parent and we were worried about our child, yet short of them continuing some kind of a parental control that restricts the student from learning and from handling their own affairs.

04:21.117 --> 04:29.427
We really, of course by state law, we can't break confidentiality except in certain cases.

04:29.997 --> 04:32.441
Child abuse, and I had one of those.

04:32.582 --> 04:39.574
I got a report that an 18-year-old female was sexually abusing a 15-year-old male in an adjacent county.

04:39.615 --> 04:40.536
I had to call the sheriff.

04:41.658 --> 04:43.241
The one I like is elderly abuse.

04:43.301 --> 04:46.487
You can't abuse me and you and get away with it.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.064
Another one, of course, is threat to life.

04:50.184 --> 04:51.465
You have the option of that.

04:51.906 --> 04:56.151
But short of that, the student has to give us written permission to break confidentiality.

04:56.211 --> 04:59.935
And so we're very respectful of that student.

04:59.955 --> 05:01.417
See, we try to treat them as an adult.

05:02.218 --> 05:08.785
And sometimes that's... I remember vividly I had a parent in my early years say, has my son John been in?

05:08.805 --> 05:10.247
And I said, well, ma'am, I said, we have...

05:10.902 --> 05:14.789
In those days, I said, we have 30 or 40 students coming in a day, so I don't know exactly.

05:14.849 --> 05:16.231
I said, I could find out, but I don't know.

05:16.251 --> 05:22.101
And she said, well, what was it she said to me?

05:22.141 --> 05:25.406
Well, I'm his mother and I want to know.

05:25.427 --> 05:27.510
And I said, well, ma'am, I said,

05:27.811 --> 05:30.156
Boy, you try to do this delicately.

05:31.138 --> 05:41.019
I said, you know, I said, please understand that if somebody called over the phone and wanted information about you, I have no way of corroborating who you are.

05:41.059 --> 05:45.769
And then we have a state law that we have to be worried about.

05:45.749 --> 05:53.517
And she said something about, well, yes, I wouldn't want my personal business discussed with somebody.

05:53.557 --> 05:54.879
And I said, yes, ma'am.

05:54.919 --> 05:59.764
I said, by the way, I said, if you really want to know, why don't you ask him?

06:00.625 --> 06:03.488
And that was my way of trying to get the communication going.

06:03.788 --> 06:05.710
I had a faculty member raise hell with me one day.

06:06.551 --> 06:08.093
He wanted information about a student.

06:08.113 --> 06:09.254
And I said, I can't give that.

06:09.794 --> 06:14.119
I said, but if you'll have the student come over, they can sign a permission release, and then I can talk with you.

06:14.420 --> 06:16.703
I don't want to go through all that stuff.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.406
He said, who do you work for?

06:18.426 --> 06:19.828
I said, Texas A&M University.

06:19.868 --> 06:22.432
He said, so do I. He said, you know, I'm going to call President Vandervyrn.

06:22.492 --> 06:23.594
I said, no, Mobley.

06:24.515 --> 06:27.099
And Mobley was an American Psychological Association.

06:27.119 --> 06:28.882
He was an industrial organizational psychologist.

06:28.902 --> 06:32.447
And I said, hey, I encourage you to call the president.

06:32.467 --> 06:37.355
Please call the president, because I want to hear him tell me that I'm going to break the law of the state of Texas.

06:37.435 --> 06:38.516
I really want to hear that.

06:38.717 --> 06:41.541
And so you get into those interesting things, you know.

06:41.521 --> 06:43.023
Fascinating.

06:43.043 --> 06:51.735
But does a parent ever call up and just say, I want to thank you for the assistance you gave?

06:51.975 --> 06:52.736
Yeah.

06:52.756 --> 06:53.958
We get that occasionally.

06:54.438 --> 07:00.566
Not too often because a lot of times the parents don't even know their kids are in counseling.

07:00.707 --> 07:01.368
Periodically.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.951
How does a person then in this profession

07:04.252 --> 07:09.878
What are their measurements of their success, their feel-good experiences?

07:10.118 --> 07:10.419
Yeah.

07:10.859 --> 07:17.106
We do, once every two years, we do a major client satisfaction survey is what we call it.

07:17.126 --> 07:22.332
And that's done on a pretty good sample size of our clients.

07:23.333 --> 07:30.681
And the feedback, and in fact, we just got our last report, the feedback is that not only were we

07:32.163 --> 07:41.173
quite successful in helping people ameliorate the presenting problem they brought to us, but that the resolution has lasted.

07:42.335 --> 07:47.861
It hasn't gone away, it hasn't dissipated, which you worry about that sometimes.

07:48.682 --> 07:51.105
So that's the feedback we're getting directly from our clients.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.907
And you've been doing that for how long?

07:52.927 --> 07:57.412
Oh, probably 14 years, every other year.

07:57.672 --> 08:00.135
How would the comparative report now?

08:00.155 --> 08:01.697
It's staying pretty similar.

08:01.677 --> 08:23.398
pretty high degree of what changes we have a whole lot of items like how did the receptionist greet you what did you think of the waiting area was it comfortable you know you get all those those variables will sometimes change but the essential quality of the counseling service that has stayed really high and and and boy like I said at East Texas State I had three people who were not

08:24.425 --> 08:27.350
Well, they were good in their own way, but they were not good for a counseling center.

08:27.791 --> 08:29.614
And it shows kids don't come in.

08:29.914 --> 08:32.018
Or if they come in, they come in one time and they never come back.

08:33.460 --> 08:38.949
During all these years, who have been the key, I'm not going to ask you anything but the positive.

08:38.969 --> 08:42.154
Who have been the key members of the counseling staff?

08:43.737 --> 08:47.884
Well, first of all, I would have to say Carrie Hope has been, she's been with me.

08:49.518 --> 08:54.884
For 26 years, she's lived through the history of this center as much as I have.

08:54.984 --> 09:01.131
She's been an intern here, a psychologist, an assistant director, an associate director.

09:01.911 --> 09:05.135
She's physically designed the three centers we've been in.

09:07.277 --> 09:10.401
She's a terribly bright and creative person.

09:12.423 --> 09:15.106
She's been like a jack of all trades.

09:15.186 --> 09:17.348
She does a wonderful job with the helpline.

09:17.750 --> 09:18.971
upstairs that we have.

09:19.832 --> 09:20.793
She's been very good.

09:22.314 --> 09:23.756
Is she related to Landis?

09:23.836 --> 09:24.637
Yeah, she's a daughter.

09:24.957 --> 09:25.457
Oh, oh.

09:25.478 --> 09:26.378
Yeah, she's a daughter.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.963
Gosh, we've had a host of such good people.

09:32.464 --> 09:37.189
We've got about 17 directors in the United States who have come out of this center.

09:37.629 --> 09:38.170
Really?

09:38.250 --> 09:38.891
Probably, yeah.

09:38.931 --> 09:46.558
We probably, I wouldn't doubt that more directors in recent years have come from this center than any center in the United States.

09:47.028 --> 09:56.945
We've had a, and I hope that's, you know, initially we've made good hiring decisions, but like the director of counseling at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Terry DiNuzzo, she's been wonderful.

09:58.789 --> 10:02.495
Laura Betor was a psychologist here for six years, great.

10:02.896 --> 10:08.766
An African-American woman, Bernadine Duncan, who's now associate director of counseling at UH downtown.

10:09.100 --> 10:12.083
She did a lot for the African-American students.

10:12.704 --> 10:13.365
I used to kid her.

10:14.226 --> 10:22.034
She had an African-American women's group that I would attend once in a while, and I once kid her, and I said, when are you going to have something for the men?

10:22.915 --> 10:28.061
And she was kind of foxy anyway, and she said, boss, she always called me boss, boss, you want an African-American?

10:28.081 --> 10:28.822
She said, I'll get you one.

10:29.503 --> 10:33.066
And a week later, she went over the MSC and just started talking to those African-American males.

10:33.327 --> 10:38.112
A week later, we had a group of African-American males over here, and minorities tend

10:39.138 --> 10:41.901
statistically not to use counseling services very well.

10:42.341 --> 10:48.968
We're very unique in that our proportion of minority students reflects their proportion in the student population.

10:49.729 --> 10:50.750
Most campuses don't.

10:52.893 --> 11:04.405
There, gee whiz, Ted Stachowiak on the current staff, he has created a new service delivery system to where we're not on the waiting list like we used to be.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.327
Now we're working the staff harder.

11:07.437 --> 11:09.283
But we don't have this.

11:09.564 --> 11:12.835
I remember one year we had 95 students waiting to get in here.

11:13.999 --> 11:19.658
And that used to worry me sick because we always get them in for one interview right away.

11:19.739 --> 11:21.761
because we want to make sure nothing serious is going on.

11:21.821 --> 11:25.325
And then they're told to call back if their situation deteriorates.

11:25.905 --> 11:29.669
But you always worry about that 95 sitting out there, what might be going on.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.691
And that used to make me crazy.

11:33.393 --> 11:39.439
Normally, about how long would it take if a student called and said, I need help now?

11:39.679 --> 11:39.939
Yeah.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.562
If it's an emergency, they're going to be seen right away.

11:42.922 --> 11:43.282
Oh, OK.

11:43.302 --> 11:43.903
Yeah.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.426
If we say to them, do you view this?

11:46.506 --> 11:47.807
Do you see this as an emergency?

11:47.847 --> 11:48.868
And they say yes.

11:48.848 --> 11:50.010
So they define it.

11:50.030 --> 11:50.871
They define, yes.

11:50.931 --> 11:52.914
Student always defines what an emergency is.

11:53.034 --> 11:55.578
Whether we agree or not, it's what they say.

11:56.218 --> 12:08.596
Because I don't want to make the slip of saying, well, because we, I remember vividly one student about five years after I was here, who I remember standing at the receptionist counter and the student, the receptionist was saying, well, is this an emergency?

12:08.656 --> 12:11.380
I said, well, probably I'll keep till Monday, you know.

12:11.881 --> 12:14.344
Little kid overdosed that weekend.

12:14.364 --> 12:16.948
See, I don't want to have to deal with that.

12:17.637 --> 12:29.749
And are those who want immediate help, are they likely to communicate by telephone or in person?

12:29.770 --> 12:30.030
Both.

12:30.891 --> 12:31.131
Both.

12:31.211 --> 12:33.814
We get them various ways.

12:34.655 --> 12:42.062
More often they're going to come in here bodily, physically, and that would be the clear majority.

12:42.122 --> 12:46.767
But we'll get them over the phone too, and sometimes that's tough because sometimes they won't reveal who they are.

12:47.135 --> 12:51.242
Now, up in the help line at night, we have the ability to trace the phone number.

12:52.184 --> 12:57.834
And of course, those people up there do not deal with suicide calls.

12:57.934 --> 13:05.848
I pay five of our psychologists 3,000 a year extra to serve as backup duty.

13:06.669 --> 13:11.117
And they immediately, the call is patched in to their phone, and they talk to the student directly.

13:11.587 --> 13:30.734
And in all of these three decades, you must have, I presume, have coped with a student threatening another student's life, someone who has already attempted to take their own life.

13:32.557 --> 13:35.981
What about somebody saying they're going to jump off a building?

13:37.003 --> 13:38.505
Yeah, I had that happen to me.

13:38.738 --> 13:39.259
directly.

13:39.339 --> 13:41.882
I had a young man, very bright.

13:44.305 --> 13:51.635
Physical stature was one that was sort of frail and sort of meek and bright.

13:52.576 --> 13:56.882
And when he came to A&M, I requested his mental health records.

13:56.942 --> 14:00.506
And he had to file that fat from a psychiatrist already.

14:00.566 --> 14:03.430
And we were doing pretty good work.

14:04.000 --> 14:13.013
And I remember one session where he suddenly jumped up out of the chair and said, I'm heading for the rotunda in the academic building.

14:13.033 --> 14:14.415
I'm going to jump off the rotunda.

14:14.916 --> 14:15.797
And he flew out the door.

14:16.819 --> 14:18.762
And I remember I chased him down the hall.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.444
And it wasn't hard for me.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.305
I'm not a big guy.

14:21.325 --> 14:23.408
But I pinned him up against the wall.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.353
And I remember saying to him, I don't know why I did this.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.035
It was totally spontaneous.

14:28.095 --> 14:31.100
I said, you are not going to kill yourself on my campus.

14:31.801 --> 14:33.383
Now get back in here, you know.

14:33.363 --> 14:40.349
I remember, too, another situation, one of our consulting psychiatrists, we had a homicide threat.

14:40.369 --> 14:44.973
By the way, homicide threats most typically come from graduate students.

14:45.734 --> 14:53.861
They are either going to send the committee out in a box if they don't get the degree, PhD, or they accuse some faculty member of fooling out their wife.

14:53.921 --> 14:55.663
Those are the two principles.

14:55.683 --> 14:58.826
Undergraduates are less prone to do the homicide thing, although it happens.

14:59.626 --> 15:02.509
And I remember we met the...

15:02.725 --> 15:07.791
We had the husband come over who was very upset and we positioned him in the back of the office.

15:08.351 --> 15:15.759
Me and the psychiatrist sat here and we arranged it where the woman came in 15 minutes later and she sat in a chair near the door.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.002
And we were strategically positioned.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.346
If he went at her, we would intercept and she could flee.

15:23.067 --> 15:23.688
We did that.

15:24.629 --> 15:26.211
That happened.

15:26.251 --> 15:30.676
Oh, we had some of the other things.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.698
We had a woman come in with a knife in her sock.

15:33.252 --> 15:36.904
and become just belligerent and acting out.

15:37.546 --> 15:38.971
We called the university police.

15:39.011 --> 15:40.917
She needed the counselor in the groin.

15:41.335 --> 15:42.817
We got her out to the elevator.

15:44.159 --> 15:46.923
The police, she tried to knee one of the policemen in the groin.

15:47.423 --> 15:54.633
They did the wonderful practical thing of standing on her feet, taking her down the elevator.

15:55.474 --> 16:03.445
I had a Vietnamese student threaten to kill his wife who was living in Louisiana.

16:04.100 --> 16:10.373
And so I, while he stayed in the room, I called her and warned her of that.

16:11.274 --> 16:24.100
We used to follow, going off on a bad tangent, we used to follow the big California court case, the Tarasoff case, where a psychiatrist had failed to warn an intended victim that his client had made a threat against them.

16:24.434 --> 16:25.977
And so we always operate on it.

16:26.017 --> 16:31.708
The state of Texas, just two years ago, the Supreme Court had a case, and it's different in Texas.

16:32.149 --> 16:37.600
You may or may not warn the intended victim, but whatever you do, you're responsible.

16:40.280 --> 16:45.849
Yeah, we've had all manner of stuff that happened.

16:46.690 --> 16:47.651
Better than soap operas.

16:49.474 --> 16:56.425
And let's see, have you been called where somebody had a whole crowd in a room?

17:00.050 --> 17:06.360
Let's see, at East Texas I was called where a kid had a knife and he was in the bushes outside of a house.

17:07.141 --> 17:08.363
I'm trying to think.

17:09.389 --> 17:16.439
No, we've had kids bring in weapons, but they haven't been agitated, obligeant, or hostile.

17:16.499 --> 17:21.786
In fact, I've had a number of them give me the weapons and I've turned them over to the university police.

17:22.207 --> 17:29.677
In fact, I had a funny incident with Elmer Schneider, who was, I don't know what his title is now, but he was chief then and under Bob Wyatt.

17:30.479 --> 17:34.384
And I got a shotgun, got a kid to give me a shotgun.

17:34.837 --> 17:38.102
Then we did counseling with him and had him under one of our two psychiatrists.

17:38.122 --> 17:39.605
We have two full-time psychiatrists here.

17:40.366 --> 17:46.957
And six months later, the psychiatrist wrote me a formal letter that, in his opinion, it was safe for him to have the weapon.

17:46.997 --> 17:54.128
Well, when I turned the weapon over, first of all, Elmer said, you know, we can't have firearms on state property.

17:54.269 --> 17:58.836
And I said, well, I said, I don't know what we're going to do with this, and I don't want this kid using it on himself.

17:59.407 --> 18:01.149
And he said, well, okay, I'll take it.

18:01.930 --> 18:03.492
He said, whose is it?

18:03.552 --> 18:04.834
I said, Elmer, I can't tell you.

18:05.034 --> 18:07.037
I said, you know, I can't break confidentiality.

18:07.077 --> 18:08.839
And he said, well, all right, I'll take it.

18:08.859 --> 18:11.863
Well, then doggone, I get the note from the psychiatrist six months later.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.725
I said, Elmer, I need a shotgun.

18:13.745 --> 18:15.968
He said, well, he said, how do I identify it?

18:17.429 --> 18:18.170
Oh, God.

18:18.791 --> 18:20.954
So he kids me about that all the time.

18:21.735 --> 18:23.457
Yeah, we've had many interesting things happen.

18:23.521 --> 18:25.023
All right.

18:25.044 --> 18:30.272
In giving support and encouragement, John Colas deserves high credit.

18:30.292 --> 18:30.773
Who else?

18:30.973 --> 18:31.674
Oh, absolutely.

18:32.536 --> 18:37.264
Really, the Student Affairs Department heads have always been extremely supportive.

18:37.845 --> 18:48.162
Dennis Corrington, Carolyn Adair, Jim Reynolds, because they've all made referrals here, and I think they understand.

18:48.622 --> 18:50.305
We're kind of a service where

18:51.027 --> 18:58.682
I don't think we're in people's everyday awareness, but boy, when these department heads all of a sudden come across a kid, they want it right now.

18:59.263 --> 19:05.796
And that's why we have people on emergency, you just spring into action quickly.

19:06.417 --> 19:10.747
I don't have very many other questions.

19:10.787 --> 19:12.852
What topics have we not?

19:13.554 --> 19:25.000
I was historically, because I had tried to do my homework here and we've covered a lot of what I had.

19:24.980 --> 19:37.170
One of the interesting things was when the old academic counseling center and the personal counseling service merged.

19:37.972 --> 19:41.200
That was the result of a committee that Chuck McCandless headed.

19:41.787 --> 19:46.072
And it was to study the role and scope of the Academic Counseling Center.

19:46.532 --> 19:52.899
Interestingly, since that center reported to Academic Affairs, the committee was composed of all academic people.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.461
Nobody on Student Affairs was on it.

19:55.302 --> 20:01.188
And the bottom line was that they decided to dissolve that center.

20:02.189 --> 20:05.033
And I don't know.

20:05.073 --> 20:09.077
The director of the center then was Dr. Art Tollefson.

20:10.458 --> 20:13.061
I have sometimes wondered, but I don't know if it's true.

20:13.441 --> 20:19.487
I don't know if the institution wanted to get rid of him and that was the way they got rid of him or not, was to wipe out the department.

20:19.527 --> 20:20.308
I have no idea.

20:20.729 --> 20:35.824
I know he was crotchety and persnickety and difficult to deal with, but Chuck, I used to, when I played a lot of racquetball, I used to, you know, be changing clothes with Chuck in the locker room and got to know him real well, and he was

20:36.479 --> 20:47.825
I just thoroughly enjoyed him and was tickled to death when we, I hope it doesn't show grabbing for power, but I was so glad when we finally could have one comprehensive center on the campus and that.

20:47.845 --> 20:51.754
And that academic affairs group that did that, that was

20:52.679 --> 20:58.245
That was a big thing because our center for college counseling centers is pretty comprehensive.

20:58.565 --> 21:02.208
A lot of counseling centers in the United States are purely psychological services.

21:03.049 --> 21:05.692
And I don't agree with that limited model.

21:05.752 --> 21:16.463
I want a kid to be able to come in here if they're not making their grades and they're having trouble reading textbooks, taking objective exams, writing essay questions, time management, math anxiety.

21:16.523 --> 21:17.764
I want them to be able to get help here.

21:18.945 --> 21:22.028
If they're changing their major for the fifth time, we want to be able to help them.

21:22.244 --> 21:27.012
If they're looking for an initial career direction, then we want to help them.

21:27.152 --> 21:29.515
We also get them over to the career center.

21:29.596 --> 21:31.959
The personal problems, the crisis intervention.

21:31.999 --> 21:36.406
Now, we're not as comprehensive as like University of Maryland that has a child guidance clinic.

21:36.827 --> 21:38.630
It has a speech and hearing clinic.

21:39.171 --> 21:40.793
But we're a pretty comprehensive center.

21:40.933 --> 21:46.362
And Chuck really, through that committee's work, allowed us to...

21:48.063 --> 21:48.784
to become that.

21:51.087 --> 22:11.792
We've just had, geez, and Malin Sutherland, Malin and I, I think he would admit, I'd say it right to him in the room, personality-wise we're probably very far apart, but, and the guy doesn't support me to support Wade Burch, he supports the center because of what it does for students, and he has been

22:12.194 --> 22:21.245
Malin has been an unexpected and surprisingly beneficial person to this counseling center.

22:21.345 --> 22:32.358
Now, we like to think it's because I think, I don't know if this is public knowledge, but one semester he did have academic trouble here at dear old A&M, and so I think he appreciates some of the things we did, but he has been wonderful.

22:32.799 --> 22:37.324
Kibler, Bill Kibler has been, I always thought that after I worked for Coldus for 20 years,

22:37.304 --> 22:43.376
that God would say, okay, Birch, you've had it good, now we're going to screw you for the next last seven years of your professional life.

22:43.396 --> 22:46.602
And I've been reporting directly to Bill Kibler, and he's been wonderful.

22:47.945 --> 22:49.408
When I need his help, he gives it to me.

22:49.488 --> 22:50.790
He never micromanages.

22:51.271 --> 22:53.776
He's never had to clean up, come over here and clean up anything.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.844
They've been great.

23:00.254 --> 23:09.067
And I, something I said in some of my retirement remarks, I mean, I will admit when I came to A&M, I heard this was a special place, but I thought, yeah, sure.

23:09.107 --> 23:16.218
And having lived it now, I really do believe A&M is unique and different and special.

23:16.498 --> 23:19.583
I really, and I'm not a graduate, but I really believe that.

23:19.643 --> 23:28.877
And I believe, I believe A&M, it's, I mean, early when I was here, I was a little put off by if you don't have the Aggie ring, you know, you can never be.

23:29.380 --> 23:43.727
I think that has lessened over the years and I think that's been good to be more inclusive in that because I think a lot of us who come here from the outside want to very much become part of A&M and it used to be that there were those roadblocks thrown up

23:44.230 --> 23:48.036
I see that really dissipating over the years, and I think that's really good.

23:49.598 --> 23:56.890
Sometimes I say to one of the hyper-conservatives on that point, I say, how long were you at A&M?

23:56.910 --> 23:58.032
Well, I was here four and a half years.

23:58.112 --> 23:59.714
I said, well, I got here in 1959.

24:01.197 --> 24:09.089
How long does it take to become someone who understands or deserves to at least have an opinion?

24:09.350 --> 24:10.812
Right.

24:11.078 --> 24:16.063
What else have we... Oh, I think that's pretty much... Well, let's see.

24:16.403 --> 24:22.308
I'm assuming that one of the most severe matters you all ever had to cope with was bonfire.

24:22.328 --> 24:23.450
Oh, yes.

24:23.530 --> 24:23.810
Yes.

24:23.830 --> 24:28.274
Did that affect the people that you all counseled?

24:29.075 --> 24:29.715
Yeah.

24:32.818 --> 24:37.963
We saw a limited number of students in counseling, pure official counseling.

24:38.467 --> 24:41.810
And they were the ones that were most dramatically affected.

24:42.951 --> 25:00.207
And we did that because many of them suffered post-traumatic stress disorder where, you know, usually after about 30 days you presume people's appetites, concentration, ability to have fun and pursue fun experiences in life, that that's going to begin to come back.

25:00.307 --> 25:04.671
But when they don't after a month, then you may have PTSD, maybe a parent.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.313
And we saw some of the tougher

25:06.682 --> 25:07.724
tougher cases of that.

25:08.225 --> 25:13.714
But we also, well, I don't know how much you want to chat about that.

25:14.836 --> 25:19.584
I got the call from Malin at about 4.45 a.m.

25:19.644 --> 25:22.850
and he said, Wade, we've had a real bad accident out here at Bonfire.

25:23.531 --> 25:24.352
Need you to come out.

25:24.693 --> 25:25.454
I said, okay.

25:26.035 --> 25:28.199
I called Ted Stachowiak, our associate director.

25:28.219 --> 25:28.740
I said, Ted,

25:29.125 --> 25:30.346
Why don't you come meet me?"

25:30.366 --> 25:37.234
You know, and we went out there and we mingled among some of the students who had been and seen witness to that.

25:37.935 --> 25:40.478
And then I immediately called an emergency 8 a.m.

25:40.518 --> 25:41.159
staff meeting.

25:41.940 --> 25:46.004
And we knew the university was going to have MSC 145 for the parents.

25:46.745 --> 25:51.651
We knew they were going to set TVs up in the flag room of the MSC.

25:52.211 --> 25:53.833
So I dispatched

25:54.893 --> 26:06.315
about four or five of our psychologists out to the site to co-mingle with students, sent two to the room where the parents were, sent three to where the kids would be watching the TV reports.

26:06.355 --> 26:13.729
So we scattered out and that was great for me because it allowed me to move from place to place and watch what was going on.

26:14.198 --> 26:22.819
we immediately got a hold of groups of students in the Cadet Corps and in this North Residence Hall area because those were the two most affected groups.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.986
So right away we got with groups of those students.

26:27.049 --> 26:31.600
Our helpline kids, bless their hearts, instead of being on duty from four,

26:31.850 --> 26:32.311
p.m.

26:32.351 --> 26:32.852
to 8 a.m.

26:32.872 --> 26:33.533
the next morning.

26:34.054 --> 26:40.824
They voted, they elected, they came and told us they wanted to work the telephones 24 hours a day, 10 days in a row.

26:41.105 --> 26:42.247
Did it over Thanksgiving.

26:42.687 --> 26:45.151
Their parents brought up Thanksgiving meals to them here.

26:45.792 --> 26:50.500
We normally get, you know, 15 to 30 calls a week.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.444
We got 350 during that period.

26:55.426 --> 26:58.911
We had the interesting phenomena of other groups coming in to help us.

27:00.413 --> 27:09.985
And we had 68 mental health people from around the state, local and outside of our local community, volunteer to come in and help us.

27:10.005 --> 27:16.673
We had a psychiatrist fly in from San Antonio, flew in here and just started working.

27:16.906 --> 27:23.642
And it was interesting because all of a sudden you've got this cadre of people that can help,

27:24.162 --> 27:29.068
But what we decided was we would try to use the locals first because they knew the A&M culture.

27:29.109 --> 27:29.829
They were here.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.713
If we needed to debrief with them, they'd be more accessible.

27:33.154 --> 27:42.927
And then after the local people on campus, then we went to the private practitioners in Bryan College Station and then finally more to people who called from around the state.

27:44.349 --> 27:47.773
We were out at the memorial services.

27:48.344 --> 27:51.108
We were in the MSC at night.

27:52.410 --> 27:54.794
We worked with the campus ministers in the chapel.

27:56.576 --> 27:59.861
The staff just, boy, they were marvelous.

28:01.083 --> 28:04.969
Looking back with the clear vision of hindsight.

28:05.489 --> 28:09.334
Is there anything we didn't do that we might have done?

28:09.374 --> 28:10.976
On the bonfire thing?

28:11.377 --> 28:18.105
Well, I think the commission report and the actions that the president is taking are, I think, all of those.

28:18.245 --> 28:18.866
Of us?

28:18.946 --> 28:19.567
Yeah.

28:19.587 --> 28:19.807
Yeah.

28:20.088 --> 28:23.492
I think, honestly, I think we were ill-prepared.

28:23.913 --> 28:24.774
Not ill-prepared.

28:25.354 --> 28:28.999
We weren't as prepared as we should have been for a...

28:28.979 --> 28:49.873
tragedy of that size I mean we had dealt with you know the flying club where they lost some students or the young man who fell asleep and ran over the people going into the fraternity party I mean things where it's you know three to six students but the enormity of this I don't think we were at all ready in fact one of the recommendations I made

28:50.461 --> 29:16.958
internally to Malin was that the director of this center ought to be formally in charge of all of the mental health kinds of services that are rendered on that site because we had people like that had done the Oklahoma bombing they came in that was a Texas group that came in and that but you need some coordination of that we were I'll tell you my opinion of that was

29:17.630 --> 29:24.675
that maybe all of us were not as well prepared as we should, but somehow everybody did their job professionally and it worked out very well.

29:25.638 --> 29:27.083
And in that way we were very lucky.

29:27.434 --> 29:37.684
Now, the people who came for counseling regarding Bonfire, were they most likely to have been the students that were present when the collapse?

29:37.704 --> 29:39.946
Present or a very dear close friend.

29:40.106 --> 29:41.327
Yeah, absolutely.

29:41.607 --> 29:42.408
Oh yeah, yeah.

29:42.448 --> 29:48.113
In fact, I had the unfortunate experience of telling one of the 12 families that their daughter had died.

29:48.193 --> 29:49.495
I had never done that before.

29:50.295 --> 29:55.180
College age population, you don't think of death, you know, and I remember

29:55.160 --> 30:19.345
they they insisted on leaving the msc 145 where which was the protected area to keep the press away from them which was good and they had come out and were waiting as the firemen you know took the thing apart and for a while one of the methodist church brought a bus over here it was air conditioned and they had a bunch of people from the family and friends there and

30:19.325 --> 30:41.535
chatted with them before we knew anything and then they went out again and sat behind those yellow tapes and finally the fireman came over to me and said somebody needs to tell the family that their daughter is dead and said but tell them, dissuade them from looking at the body because the body was so mangled we couldn't tell what gender the body was until we found a social security card and

30:41.515 --> 30:46.901
So I said to the family, this was one of the two hard points for me.

30:46.981 --> 30:51.186
I just walked over to them and I said, I need you to come with me back to the bus.

30:52.127 --> 30:56.713
And I said it with some degree of authority in my voice because I didn't want them quibbling with me.

30:57.313 --> 30:58.475
Fortunately, they followed me.

30:58.515 --> 31:00.537
And then, you know, they all sat down.

31:00.557 --> 31:02.079
I think they had an inkling what was coming.

31:02.099 --> 31:03.861
And I finally, I just said,

31:03.841 --> 31:08.208
I don't know how to tell you this, and then they knew, you know, and that kind of thing.

31:08.508 --> 31:17.222
And then immediately, I and my secretary, interestingly, went right to the roommate over here in this residence hall complex and met with the roommate.

31:17.402 --> 31:21.008
And we continued to follow students for a number of months.

31:21.969 --> 31:24.593
One great thing was the Texas Psychological Association.

31:24.653 --> 31:25.815
We put out a call.
