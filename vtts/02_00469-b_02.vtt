WEBVTT

00:01.499 --> 00:05.182
No, I sure don't. I haven't found any positive 
responses to that question. Now, often people,

00:10.507 --> 00:17.213
sometimes journalists talk about a military 
mentality. Do you think there's a military

00:17.233 --> 00:20.515
mentality, and if so, what is it? I don't really 
know about that.

00:28.082 --> 00:30.544
That would be hard for me to really. distinguish 
that.

00:38.203 --> 00:40.806
I'm a little lost on that one. I just can't see where 
they, I don't see why, how they get that. You've

00:45.673 --> 00:47.896
heard of that term though haven't you? I'm not sure 
I have. Yeah I guess, I guess I know what you're

00:52.081 --> 00:55.165
talking about. I might not have heard it called 
military mentality. I may have heard it say that

00:59.702 --> 01:12.100
he's got a military way or some such thing, which to 
me is not really a fault. It may be an attribute. No,

01:14.904 --> 01:16.886
I'm not saying that at all. Okay, let's move on 
then. When you became an A&M graduate officer, Did

01:26.566 --> 01:35.859
you find that the what did you find was the quality 
of the officers that graduated?

01:38.463 --> 01:39.865
Especially after you got out in the field. Now do 
you mean after I How good was the training here at

01:41.848 --> 01:50.881
A&M for officers? I think a good a good description 
of it was what I told you a while ago this colonel

01:52.891 --> 02:21.379
comes back who's not an Aggie and picks vast 
majority of Aggies for this particular unit that

01:52.891 --> 02:21.379
he commanded when he was given the selection of who 
he wanted to serve in this unit and I think

01:52.891 --> 02:21.379
everywhere that I went the feeling was that the 
Aggies were well trained ROTC officers.

02:25.791 --> 02:42.948
In fact, I've heard some remarks, not personally, 
but in printed materials and whatnot, of some of

02:25.791 --> 02:42.948
the top men in World War II, the top military 
people, that have had most high remarks from A&M

02:25.791 --> 02:42.948
officers. What do you think West Pointers think of 
A&M officers? I can tell you what they think. They

02:47.953 --> 02:49.395
don't think very highly of them. They don't? I 
mean, it's a jealousy. I think if they were real

02:52.831 --> 03:10.569
sincere, they would tell you that they've made 
good officers, but there's a jealousy between the

02:52.831 --> 03:10.569
West Point and the ROTCs, at least that's what I 
found. Did you explain this jealousy?

03:14.633 --> 03:17.416
Why are they jealous? Well, one thing I think, 
because there's so darn many more of us, and uh well

03:22.177 --> 03:51.340
Aggie officers were down-to-earth officers I 
mean I think we had a lot of good common sense and a

03:22.177 --> 03:51.340
lot of the West Pointers were so military oriented 
and so so the West Point oriented and all of them I

03:22.177 --> 03:51.340
mean Every one of them are trying their darndest to 
get up another one on the ladder. And every

03:57.091 --> 04:06.925
cockeyed thing they do is, I mean, it's headed for 
what's in the future for them. And I think the

04:08.287 --> 04:18.222
philosophy of that is even though we always wanted 
to excel and get to be higher levels, I think our aim

04:20.193 --> 04:26.463
more was to do a good job and then those things would 
take care of themselves. The West Pointer, he

04:26.483 --> 04:30.229
can't think of anything but the darn star. And I 
mean, he'll trample you to death to get there.

04:38.082 --> 04:46.555
And their social activities, their whole life is 
centered around, you know, Kissing the general's

04:47.851 --> 04:50.855
wife or whatever, you know. Promotion? Yeah, 
sure. I mean, that's from morning till night. Now,

04:56.423 --> 05:03.553
there are exceptions, I'm sure, but their general 
philosophy is, boy, how high can I get? And I think

05:03.573 --> 05:14.348
the ROTC officer is the only thing about doing a 
good job and those things take care of themselves.

05:15.695 --> 05:17.236
Did you know a lot of West Pointers? Yes, I did. I 
suppose you have. And how could you compare the

05:18.538 --> 05:25.825
training that they've had versus our training? 
Well, all the ones that I saw, of course, their

05:25.845 --> 05:36.175
technical training probably exceeded ours. Your 
technical military training? Yes, that's

05:39.718 --> 05:42.281
correct. Their technical... civilian training 
or their technical administrative training or

05:44.416 --> 06:13.849
their

05:44.416 --> 06:13.849
day-to-day courses that they took probably were 
not to the level of ours but of course the service

05:44.416 --> 06:13.849
academies of course dwell on the military 
subjects they did a great deal more military

05:44.416 --> 06:13.849
subjects than ROTC officers so So they've been 
exposed to a great deal more. But the general rule

06:18.427 --> 06:22.131
of them, they feel that too. And they want you to 
know that too. They don't make any bones about it.

06:28.636 --> 06:32.200
And that's darn near without exception. That is 
the ones I've run into. In other words, you think

06:33.801 --> 06:37.424
there's some friction between the A&M men and the 
West Point men? There sure were. There was

06:39.526 --> 06:41.167
throughout your career. Yeah. Something that's 
real funny, and it's part of the

06:43.732 --> 06:51.023
down-to-earthness that I'm talking about. Of 
course, the Aggies have always been known for

06:51.183 --> 07:06.667
their table manners in the mess halls, which are 
not according to Emily Post or some of those, and

06:51.183 --> 07:06.667
the West Pointers despise that. Well, you know, 
it's not...

07:13.381 --> 07:18.830
It's not the best in the world, but it's part of that 
camaraderie and esprit de corps and all this. They

07:19.311 --> 07:21.294
have their own way of doing this sort of thing. When 
we first went on active duty, if you used the mess

07:22.215 --> 07:39.523
hall lingo and asked a West Pointer to shoot the 
gunwiden or to pass the sandan or whatever, he

07:22.215 --> 07:39.523
would absolutely ignore you. Now, he knew exactly 
what you were saying, but they would not only just,

07:40.668 --> 08:01.275
you know, you would think they'd just pass it and 
sort of ignore you and all this, but I mean, they

07:40.668 --> 08:01.275
wouldn't pass you anything unless you asked them 
to pass the bread or pass the salt and pepper. And

08:01.295 --> 08:07.083
that sort of thing just really put us on different 
courses. And when I was first called active duty,

08:07.103 --> 08:10.287
we had out of the hundred officers in this regiment 
we had about five west pointers and they were

08:11.161 --> 08:39.885
really with one exception they were just sort of 
outcasts we just would not have much to do with them

08:11.161 --> 08:39.885
and it's bad that is a bad situation and we are much 
to blame as they are but we were one direction and

08:11.161 --> 08:39.885
they're the other see they're they're you know 
just Straight down the line, and of course we, you

08:40.152 --> 08:44.457
know. In other words, you'd say that we're 
probably more pragmatic. Is that what we're

08:47.660 --> 08:49.983
grasping for? I guess. Or is that, I don't want to 
put words in your mouth. Well, the,

08:54.127 --> 09:04.759
we were always so, so close to each other that that 
we you know whatever it took to get along and to help

09:05.144 --> 09:31.371
you fellow man and to to be a down-to-earth person 
this is what you're saying and they're instilled

09:05.144 --> 09:31.371
that you know they're they're officers and 
gentlemen by an act of congress and yeah

09:05.144 --> 09:31.371
and I think I just never really saw a great deal of 
exception to that I mean after they after they got

09:31.925 --> 09:53.888
on up to be generals and whatnot they lost a little 
bit of that separation but we used to we used to have

09:31.925 --> 09:53.888
lots of discussion about it and we did it in a 
friendly manner but there is a difference a great

09:31.925 --> 09:53.888
difference. Now when you graduated let's talk 
about when you graduated did you have did you have

09:53.908 --> 10:00.615
firm aims to go into civilian engineering? Yes. No 
thought about going into the military as a

10:05.870 --> 10:08.614
profession?

10:11.659 --> 10:18.970
Uh, there were not, first place, there were not but 
very few opportunities at that time. There were

10:18.990 --> 10:26.422
some officers that went in under what they called a 
Thomas Nag, which was a one-year program. Yeah.

10:27.393 --> 10:44.895
and many of them ultimately became regular army 
but I didn't really have any aspirations for that

10:27.393 --> 10:44.895
at all and I guess with my thinking military might 
wonder why but I was interested in getting out and

10:45.432 --> 10:50.298
starting engineering and get on that course. If 
there had been numerous Thomason Act

10:51.640 --> 11:09.381
opportunities, it might have been different, but 
and I think they took probably the top ROTC

10:51.640 --> 11:09.381
students as far as the military subjects they'd 
taken and there was probably a little politics in

10:51.640 --> 11:09.381
it too, I expect. but I really never gave it up. Then 
let's start with your academic career. We haven't

11:14.215 --> 11:19.204
even started talking about your academics here at 
A&M. We know why you wanted to go into engineering

11:19.224 --> 11:24.934
school and why you came here. What, what some of the 
faculty, who are some of the faculty or staff that

11:26.117 --> 11:31.446
had an impact on you? Well there was a Well in the 
C.E. department named McNew. McNew. Right. And

11:41.952 --> 11:50.283
there was an old gentleman who was just in the last 
year passed away named Sandstedt.

11:50.323 --> 11:58.353
S-A-N-D-S-T-E-D-T

11:50.323 --> 11:58.353
who was a great old gentleman. All the C.E. 
students loved him. I had a math professor named

12:03.108 --> 12:12.078
McGee, Roger McGee, that I thought was real 
terrific. And of course we got on up into the

12:12.098 --> 12:17.885
structures and hydraulics and this sort of thing. 
Fred Benson out there at A&M was a young, I presume

12:18.065 --> 12:28.938
he was a graduate student about the time I was 
there. Everybody thought Fred Benson was a fine

12:28.958 --> 12:32.642
teacher. Uh there was an old fellow that uh that ran 
the mechanical engineering shops that taught me a

12:33.584 --> 12:57.030
class or two named

12:33.584 --> 12:57.030
Walter Downer that was you know you had people that 
you think golly I sure wish I could do that sort of

12:33.584 --> 12:57.030
thing sometime you know. They were that tight? 
Yeah and then the man who was head of ME department

13:00.162 --> 13:28.684
at that time uh it's still here in Bryan that taught 
me a few classes that you remember you remember

13:00.162 --> 13:28.684
them well like we always thought that they were 
interested in teaching you that they were

13:00.162 --> 13:28.684
interested in you you're grasping their subjects 
and not not just being there for spend an hour with

13:00.162 --> 13:28.684
you so they were I had a great many of them Had 
another one that taught me history. Count

13:34.124 --> 13:35.126
Chigarth. Have you ever heard of him? Yeah. 
General Butler was telling me about him. The

13:39.796 --> 13:43.364
clown. Well you know he got his subjects over well 
because he remembered him.

13:51.682 --> 14:19.933
and and Jolly he was a Russian actually he was a 
immigrant I think he had to get out of some part of

13:51.682 --> 14:19.933
Russia for the Sadie's Island or whatever where he 
got the name Count I really don't know but uh

13:51.682 --> 14:19.933
talking holy lords Mr. Hanover

13:51.682 --> 14:19.933
but some of those you know that really I don't know 
that that was any attribute they had, but darn you

14:20.538 --> 14:26.004
remember the fellow. You ask him a question that 
happened to be wrong, he'd say, Mr. Hanover, where

14:26.024 --> 14:36.496
did you get that answer? Well, I thought I got it out 
of the book count. The book's no damn good. throw it

14:43.437 --> 14:51.228
out the window and say, well, you know, it's just 
wild, but you learn from it. What

14:51.248 --> 14:56.736
did you think of the quality of education?

14:59.519 --> 15:05.648
Well, I'm not sure that I was evaluating it at that 
time. Well, let's say after you got out in the field

15:06.337 --> 15:09.742
of being a professional engineer. I thought it was 
pretty darn good. Okay, and you met people from

15:11.884 --> 15:16.370
other engineering schools across the state and 
country. That's right. And, you know, I've talked

15:17.792 --> 15:23.039
with a lot of people who've gone to other schools. 
You know, what did you do in summer survey? How did

15:26.303 --> 15:30.008
you get along in analytic geometry and this sort of 
thing? I think we stacked up very well. I was always

15:35.733 --> 15:45.247
pleased to see how he graduated me

15:35.733 --> 15:45.247
and him. There were a lot of there were a good many 
teachers that I had back in those times that that I

15:45.908 --> 15:55.041
thought

15:57.080 --> 16:25.011
knew their subjects well but were a little a little 
weak on being able to present it which gosh you're

15:57.080 --> 16:25.011
going to have that any time but then the ones who who 
did either I got it well or they put it over well

15:57.080 --> 16:25.011
those are the ones you remember and I had a 
chemistry teacher who knew his subject I'm sure

15:57.080 --> 16:25.011
backward and forward But he had a heavy German 
brogue, and I had not had any chemistry in high

16:25.295 --> 16:32.184
school. And I knew from the time I'd been in there, 
two weeks, that I wasn't gonna pass it.

16:40.736 --> 16:45.683
And he geared his education to those who had had 
high school chemistry. and I presume if I had asked

16:47.047 --> 17:13.375
him to spend some extra time with me he probably 
would have but a freshman you're reluctant to ask

16:47.047 --> 17:13.375
them to do this sort of thing or at least I sure seem 
to be sure and I failed it I knew I was going to fail it

16:47.047 --> 17:13.375
but I stayed in there and I know I learned something 
turned right around in the summer and took it again

16:47.047 --> 17:13.375
and made a B out of it but I got a different professor 
You know I laid a lot of that failure to

17:14.232 --> 17:18.697
communication. Yeah.

17:22.581 --> 17:31.330
And I've told a lot of people about that over the 
years and I was several others that had that same

17:22.581 --> 17:31.330
fellow experienced the same thing I did. Of course 
when I was a freshman so they told me they were 60

17:33.072 --> 17:43.002
percent of my freshman class that failed freshman 
chemistry and that is too high. Yeah. there's some

17:44.877 --> 18:10.176
problems that ain't all the students yeah but 
anyway speaking speaking of the students what do

17:44.877 --> 18:10.176
you think of the quality of the student colleagues 
that you have well I thought of course at that time

17:44.877 --> 18:10.176
uh not everybody wanted to go to college and win I'm 
sure oh yeah so I guess maybe we had a little cut

17:44.877 --> 18:10.176
above what you would say was just across the board 
desire to go to college. And I was, I thought we had

18:15.334 --> 18:24.228
an awfully good group of students. The ones I came 
in direct contact with, I made some friends that I

18:24.248 --> 18:30.578
still have today. So, you know, I think we, I think 
we did pretty well. I guess, I guess they were a

18:38.659 --> 18:43.906
good, better than average.

18:45.469 --> 18:55.903
Now often, I've heard coming down to Texas A&M that 
there's, that this is more than an institution of

18:45.469 --> 18:55.903
higher learning, that it's something special. 
What do you think about that? Yeah, I really think

18:59.768 --> 19:00.991
it is. Could you define what it is that's special 
about it, about your feelings? Yeah, I think part

19:07.008 --> 19:14.588
of it is the students that go there, and the 
relationship that develops when they're there.

19:15.597 --> 19:42.027
and the relationship now I've got to be speaking 
from back yonder because we're talking about the

19:15.597 --> 19:42.027
late 30s and I think there was a there was a 
relationship between students and the teachers

19:15.597 --> 19:42.027
that was good I think that as I said a while ago these 
these folks that that had a keen interest in me They

19:42.260 --> 20:09.617
wanted to see you do what held you up and of course as 
I moved up through the years most of my work was in

19:42.260 --> 20:09.617
the CE department and we had people that had been 
out in the industry and they were able to tell you

19:42.260 --> 20:09.617
firsthand about construction problems and 
financial problems and public relations

19:42.260 --> 20:09.617
problems

20:11.302 --> 20:34.035
production problems and this sort of thing so I 
think that that relationship

20:11.302 --> 20:34.035
generated this closeness to the students and then 
you know as a snowball rolls it gets bigger and it it

20:11.302 --> 20:34.035
makes itself and I think from way back there This 
relationship that the students have and the

20:34.758 --> 20:46.554
former students with the university, I think that 
makes it a unique university. I think it's just got

20:46.674 --> 20:58.470
qualities that, at least from back in my family, I 
think it's got qualities that stay with you. and

20:59.041 --> 21:20.442
makes you want to meet others that have been there 
and when you see one you feel you've really got

20:59.041 --> 21:20.442
something coming

20:59.041 --> 21:20.442
so it's sort of a camaraderie there too that's 
right is that what they mean when they talk about

20:59.041 --> 21:20.442
spirit yeah that's right are there other aspects 
of this spirit Oh, of course it would have lots of

21:20.624 --> 21:36.700
aspects to it, but I think it's that thing that

21:20.624 --> 21:36.700
this ring is the trademark. You can see an Aggie 
across the room, if you've got a ring on you

21:36.780 --> 21:44.667
recognize it and know something about it that you 
look for. In fact, every time I meet anybody with a

21:44.687 --> 21:49.332
class ring on, I have to take a look at it. and it 
doesn't matter if this whole top's worn off you see

21:50.138 --> 22:05.582
it's an Aggie ring and I don't know they just there 
are people that that condemn that aspect saying

21:50.138 --> 22:05.582
you know you're clannish and you're If you're not 
an Aggie, you're not any part of the crowd and all

22:06.187 --> 22:10.591
this sort of thing. I guess I can understand why 
people say that, but we on the inside feel that it's

22:10.611 --> 22:16.517
great. Okay. To each his own, you know. Right. And 
what way do you think that A&M changed your life?

22:27.166 --> 22:35.434
Oh, of course it gave me a degree and put me on the 
road to a career that was very satisfying, of

22:27.166 --> 22:35.434
course. It started my military career. It gave me 
an appreciation for work because I had a job there

22:39.932 --> 22:51.224
when I needed it to go to school. It taught me the 
value of work. It taught me the value of people who

22:53.186 --> 22:58.151
were interested in me. We had a fellow who 
supervised student labor out there. His name was

23:04.017 --> 23:05.218
Horsley. And that man treated us like we were his 
boys. I mean, he wanted you to work, but he was the

23:12.289 --> 23:18.576
coordinator of all the student labor. And he had 
just as much interest in me as he would if I hadn't

23:20.378 --> 23:25.824
been Horsley. And that that just has stayed with me 
and here's people that are interested in

23:29.718 --> 23:50.545
students, interested in people getting along, 
getting a job, doing something that makes it

23:29.718 --> 23:50.545
available for them to go to school and of course the 
some of the professors down there as I say are still

23:50.963 --> 23:58.331
still treasures to me and it just I guess gave me the 
platform to spring from. Of course

23:58.351 --> 24:19.553
the academic experiences gave me the it didn't 
make me a darn bit better than a man out there who who

23:58.351 --> 24:19.553
had worked and come up through the ranks but it gave 
me something an ability to excel and get past that

23:58.351 --> 24:19.553
fellow down the road. When I got out and went to 
work, I was put under the supervision of a fellow

24:23.570 --> 24:33.703
who was seven, eight, ten years older than I. Never 
had a day of college in his life, didn't graduate

24:34.565 --> 24:44.538
from high school, but he was, he could figure in his 
head faster than I could figure on a calculator.

24:45.820 --> 24:47.262
And he ran a survey crew, and he knew a world of the 
basics of engineering and he taught them to me. He

24:56.913 --> 25:10.508
learned his through the hard knock school and he 
couldn't take a book and work a calculus problem,

24:56.913 --> 25:10.508
he couldn't take a book and work a trigonometry 
problem, but he could work any problem he needed to

24:56.913 --> 25:10.508
run a survey crew. But I was put under him and what he 
told me to do by George I did. or I would have been out

25:18.983 --> 25:21.546
on the street. And I learned to respect

25:22.747 --> 25:28.733
the grandfather people. I'm talking about the 
people who come up here that way. But it wasn't long

25:32.537 --> 25:38.383
until he was under me, and I was directing him, and 
he respected that. Because he knew that I had

25:39.284 --> 25:44.789
technical training, I had college training, and 
we had no problem. But I started out right under

25:45.510 --> 25:47.472
him. And I think and I saw a number of people who did 
not come from A&M that went to work for us put him

25:48.194 --> 26:10.928
under that fella and they thought right off that 
that was a degradation of their abilities and

25:48.194 --> 26:10.928
capabilities and they took offense to it and it 
didn't last long. now that's there are exceptions

26:11.718 --> 26:32.443
to that too but we learned as I've indicated a time 
or two we learned to respect authority and

26:11.718 --> 26:32.443
jurisdiction and when the higher man said you're 
working for this fellow that's what he was I didn't

26:11.718 --> 26:32.443
question it but my technical ability and my will to 
excel it wasn't long before I moved on. Okay as soon

26:39.657 --> 26:49.528
as you graduated and and then the period before you 
went into the service before you were called back

26:39.657 --> 26:49.528
to duty tell me about that occupation. Well I went 
to work for the highway department. Okay. As a they

26:53.853 --> 27:01.722
called it a rodman I was just a flunky to the to the 
survey crew and we were We were going out and we were

27:02.073 --> 27:22.177
chaining and cutting brush and staking out 
highway construction projects and just wanted to

27:02.073 --> 27:22.177
follow the group you know and learn it from the 
ground even though I had taken surveys in the

27:02.073 --> 27:22.177
evening. That's right just like putting a

27:27.503 --> 27:32.328
a man on an oil rig who graduated from A&M, you know, 
you want him to learn it from the floor up. My boss

27:32.468 --> 27:34.950
said, you're starting at the ground. So I did that 
and then after a few months, my boss put me in the

27:35.631 --> 27:53.769
office and I was doing a little plan work because I 
could calculate and I could balance dirt and I

27:35.631 --> 27:53.769
could lay grade lines and I could calculate 
estimates and this sort of thing. But that's about

27:53.789 --> 27:57.392
as far as I got because I only worked nine months. 
and what called the service. So I really just sort

28:00.700 --> 28:16.498
of got in on the ground floor and was able to sort of 
establish myself and show him that I wanted to work

28:00.700 --> 28:16.498
and that whatever he gave me to do, I wanted to try to 
learn it. And what responsibility he said I was to

28:17.380 --> 28:21.124
take, that was it. Now this is 1940 and the economy 
was starting to pick up with the war going on in

28:21.705 --> 28:26.991
Europe. Were there other alternatives besides 
the highway, any other alternatives for jobs that

28:27.359 --> 28:33.906
you might have had any opportunities? There were a 
good many, I say a good many, there were some

28:34.586 --> 28:42.894
contractors that came to A&M to hire civil 
engineers. Several of the steel fabricating

28:43.075 --> 28:47.199
companies wanted engineers. A lot of them working 
on defense industries? I presume, and then just

28:50.642 --> 28:55.527
designers, The aircraft industry was beginning 
to hire engineers. The highway department had a

29:00.614 --> 29:03.138
standing offer. They would take all the engineers 
who graduated from A&M in Texas. Really? Yeah, see

29:07.545 --> 29:14.836
they were, we were, the highway department was 
beginning to get monies to expand their

29:07.545 --> 29:14.836
operations after World War II. But we, anybody, 
any civil engineer that wanted to go to work for the

29:15.857 --> 29:23.168
highway department when I graduated could go to 
work. Why'd you decide on them instead of other

29:23.840 --> 29:27.586
occupations? Because of this thing that I was 
telling you before, road work fascinated me.

29:31.733 --> 29:33.235
Yeah, okay, okay. Seeing something done from 
nothing to a finished product. Right, right. And I

29:40.807 --> 29:45.915
really never even gave a thought to any other type 
of engineering but highway. and I took a good many

29:46.250 --> 29:58.689
elective highway engineering courses so my air 
was just headed in that direction. Okay I say let's

29:58.709 --> 30:01.573
continue tomorrow. That's great. Okay.
