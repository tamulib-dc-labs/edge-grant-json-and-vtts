WEBVTT

00:03.575 --> 00:07.840
That's really what we like to

00:03.575 --> 00:07.840
do. Sometimes we go as far as trying to define the 
problem. Most times, the ordinary engineer is

00:13.486 --> 00:22.155
involved in solving other people's problems. 
Science thinks that there is a... science is

00:22.175 --> 00:31.185
something in itself. It doesn't need 
application. In fact, if it has application,

00:34.213 --> 00:42.787
perhaps it's already limited or hated.

00:42.807 --> 00:47.715
I once heard a toast given on pure mathematics. The 
toast was, here's to pure mathematics. May it

00:50.198 --> 00:53.283
never be of any use to anybody. And that, in the 
context of freedom of thought, not constrained by

00:53.303 --> 00:59.333
application. So if you want to define pure science 
in that way, that's not what we're involved in. Do

01:09.983 --> 01:12.606
you think you're just doing it by application? Not 
by application, but to function or purpose.

01:18.915 --> 01:25.303
I always have a bottom line that I'm doing this 
because it's going to affect this result.

01:28.979 --> 01:37.512
I think science is a very valuable, you've got to 
have pure, applied, basic, whatever you want to

01:28.979 --> 01:37.512
call it. And I don't know, I don't use the word pure 
science very much. People use the word basic

01:42.079 --> 01:44.443
science. And in basic science, at the research 
level, PhD level, there's not much difference

01:45.805 --> 01:55.881
between what an engineer does and what a scientist 
does. But I think the bottom line is an engineering

01:56.789 --> 02:05.600
research person would have the application or the 
bottom line purpose in mind as he does it. So he

02:06.281 --> 02:08.064
starts out to do a problem. And in going along, he 
finds he doesn't have all the answers. He can't

02:13.451 --> 02:16.635
solve the problem. So then he looks beyond. And he 
doesn't look... He looks beyond what he's doing

02:20.680 --> 02:25.446
and tries to find... more knowledge about to bring 
to bear on the problem. That's what he does. And so

02:32.233 --> 02:40.043
he would expand and hopefully encompass the body 
of knowledge that will allow him to solve his

02:32.233 --> 02:40.043
problem. If he does, then that's it. If he doesn't, 
he'll go as far into magnetic theory or crystal

02:42.847 --> 02:51.919
structure or whatever needs to be done in his 
discipline. The engineer is working in solid

02:51.959 --> 02:53.982
state electronics. over there doing the same kind 
of basic stuff as the guys in physics who are in the

02:54.586 --> 03:04.355
same field, crystallography. They're looking at 
the structure of crystals and how the electrons go

03:04.375 --> 03:08.439
over here and over there. Those guys over in 
engineering are doing the same thing. But it's

03:12.003 --> 03:13.064
just the perspective. In science, they're maybe 
doing it just to understand what's going on. And in

03:17.748 --> 03:21.331
engineering, we're trying to make the circuit 
work faster. We're looking for ways to do it. In my

03:25.163 --> 03:45.446
opinion, there's plenty of opportunity to do 
either one, but generally, in engineering, we're

03:25.163 --> 03:45.446
trying to get a job done cost-effectively that 
sets our,

03:25.163 --> 03:45.446
what we're doing, motion. As an engineer, did you 
find working with T's cost-effective?

03:50.122 --> 03:52.966
Basically, I didn't know much about cheese. I 
mean, I knew of cheese, I knew Harry Whitmore, I

03:53.086 --> 04:05.283
knew, you know, but that didn't, I was just my own, 
the typical engineering faculty member involved

03:53.086 --> 04:05.283
in research in a company. It's a vertically 
integrated company. He draws his own crafts, he

04:07.425 --> 04:18.981
writes his own proposals, he executes those 
proposals, he goes to Washington to sell them,

04:07.425 --> 04:18.981
takes the money, he spends it, and he testifies to 
Congress, and he lectures internationally. He

04:24.354 --> 04:29.260
does all those things, like drawing his own graphs 
to go into an international forum. He's in his

04:30.302 --> 04:33.787
area, and he's just like this, a slice. And he's out 
doing that all around the world. Now,

04:38.413 --> 04:44.361
you come to a point in your career where you would 
like to take what you're doing and involve maybe

04:45.151 --> 05:13.403
more people or give it some structure and say what i 
need is a laboratory and what i need is this piece of

04:45.151 --> 05:13.403
equipment to make this laboratory go where am i 
going to generate that that money you say my

04:45.151 --> 05:13.403
contracts specify that i'm going to do this kind of 
research and i'm going to employ these kind of

04:45.151 --> 05:13.403
people they almost never have large equipment or 
space so now you need to go see somebody is helping

05:14.058 --> 05:16.440
you and saying, gee, here's my problem. I need to 
have $100,000 worth of equipment. If I had this

05:20.585 --> 05:24.769
$100,000 of equipment, I can generate $500,000 of 
research a year. This is going to educate this many

05:25.529 --> 05:28.052
kids, this much overhead. It sounds like a good 
deal. Here's your money. Go do it. And then you

05:31.515 --> 05:36.140
never see them again, except if you don't do it. 
Well, how do the researchers come to find out that

05:36.701 --> 05:43.187
TEAS exists to do that? Some astute people find 
that out in three or four years. Some dummies like

05:50.130 --> 05:55.336
me, it takes seven or eight years that there is the 
opportunity to do that. It kind of depends on your

05:55.356 --> 05:58.860
own personal... If you've come here to get that, 
then you've exposed yourself. You've asked for

06:03.345 --> 06:07.730
assistance, and now the eye is on you. You've asked 
for $100,000? Okay, you've got it. Now let's see

06:10.813 --> 06:11.994
what you can do, fellas. We're watching. So... You 
want to risk that kind of exposure when you do that.

06:19.655 --> 06:24.600
So that's a certain side of it. It just depends how 
mature you are. Generally, you don't come here

06:26.441 --> 06:31.726
anyway without your department head. So 
generally, T's would say, OK, go back. If your

06:36.750 --> 06:44.697
department head believes in this as much as you 
believe in this, you both come to me, and we'll talk

06:36.750 --> 06:44.697
about what the opportunities are. You really 
can't afford to deal with 500 different faculty

06:46.145 --> 06:54.192
members on a day-to-day, personal basis until you 
deal with the department head. That's really been

06:54.632 --> 06:58.075
the key that you can't be affected. The department 
head then makes some judgment and say, you know,

06:58.656 --> 07:06.563
I'm doing about a million dollars worth of 
research. TEAS probably shouldn't be able to

07:06.583 --> 07:10.146
support me about 10% of that or something. So this 
year I might be able to ask for $100,000 to make new

07:10.727 --> 07:14.650
things happen. And if I ask for it all for this guy, 
then I'm not going to be able to come back again. So I

07:19.488 --> 07:22.092
better believe in it. And if the department head 
believes in it, and then comes with you to get the

07:22.112 --> 07:35.170
money, and the faculty member knows it's a 
worthwhile thing, the department head dies, and

07:22.112 --> 07:35.170
he can

07:22.112 --> 07:35.170
get . As

07:35.190 --> 07:43.641
an engineer, and as someone doing research,

07:46.709 --> 07:53.401
Did you, how did you personally realize that TUES 
was here?

07:53.421 --> 08:07.908
Well, in my case, we were one of the departments 
that had a separate, every department head is a

07:53.421 --> 08:07.908
TUES division head. In engineering. In 
engineering, right. So the department head of

08:10.334 --> 08:15.201
electrical engineering is the department head 
and the division head for TEAS research. So you

08:16.002 --> 08:20.728
know, and he's the main interface. You really work 
with the department head. And the department head

08:22.270 --> 08:24.673
works for two people. When he wants to get research 
money, he works for the experimentation. When he

08:28.018 --> 08:33.085
wants to get some new courses, he works for the 
dean. So you know that. In some departments'

08:34.987 --> 08:38.552
cases, in the early days, There was somebody from 
this office who was really the division head. And

08:44.061 --> 08:47.665
the department head wasn't interested in 
research, for example. He said, we don't really

08:47.685 --> 08:49.267
need too much research. Then there was another 
person. And Dr. Bain was the representative from

08:50.408 --> 08:58.075
the Ingenic Experiment Station who helped us with 
research. So he would visit every month or so and

08:58.095 --> 09:05.983
come around

08:58.095 --> 09:05.983
and talk to you. So that was the structure. money 
paid to the director or to the heads of the

09:09.633 --> 09:14.899
departments coming from TEAS? Sure, right. 
Generally, one quarter of the salary is put aside.

09:20.946 --> 09:23.489
And it's up to them if they would like to. They get so 
much money. And if they would like to put

09:26.513 --> 09:29.356
themselves on the payroll, that's fine. If they 
would like to save that money and teach more

09:29.376 --> 09:35.163
courses themselves and give that money to junior 
faculty, that's great. But if they do put

09:35.183 --> 09:37.846
themselves on time and get release time to do this. 
Right. But it's there. And in part of his case, he

09:41.558 --> 09:44.002
releases himself. Yeah. But he feels that his time 
is best invested. Sure. How do you feel the role of

09:51.774 --> 10:03.311
teams has changed in terms of dissemination

09:51.774 --> 10:03.311
of information? There was a period of time many, 
many years ago when engineering experimentation

10:06.603 --> 10:14.292
used to make official publications on the work 
they did. And as far as I could tell in the 70s, that

10:14.312 --> 10:21.581
wasn't done.

10:21.641 --> 10:29.490
I think in 81, we got Penny Beaumont to come over and 
reestablish our information services. And I

10:30.351 --> 10:35.057
think the dissemination of information has 
improved vastly, but I think it's nowhere near

10:35.645 --> 10:46.835
Have we been able to disseminate information

10:35.645 --> 10:46.835
on the level we should, and as effectively as we 
should? We're now doing a number of things. For

10:48.917 --> 10:54.642
example, we have abstracts in our Windows 
publication of recent Keyes' publications. We

10:54.662 --> 10:58.045
started a research library that we're going to 
catalog and house. We started the Keyes monograph

10:58.926 --> 11:03.390
series, which is going to see a report or a paper 
dealing with a single topic. And while it may be

11:09.325 --> 11:24.008
technically very advanced and very interesting, 
to be really useful to the next level of working

11:09.325 --> 11:24.008
person, such as a consulting engineer or whoever 
it might be, it needs to be put together a little

11:09.325 --> 11:24.008
bit. So what I've been looking for is 
opportunities to take those people working in an

11:24.028 --> 11:28.956
area four or five years. that understand that 
they've written four or five papers, put that

11:29.560 --> 11:39.836
together in a format that's going to be useful from 
then on, but not just be isolated topics. So that's

11:40.738 --> 11:52.817
what the purpose of the Thieves Monograph Series 
is, to take this mature research body of work, put

11:40.738 --> 11:52.817
it together in a form that is now permanent and 
useful as reference material for the rest of the

11:40.738 --> 11:52.817
world. So we're just trying different niches and 
trying to fill those niches. And we've started on

11:56.990 --> 12:03.061
several areas, but I think there's a lot more we 
have

11:56.990 --> 12:03.061
to do. Are there any other particular programs 
that I haven't asked you about that you remember as

12:03.081 --> 12:12.579
being partisan? Over the years? Mm-hmm.

12:20.388 --> 12:23.771
No, I really can't think of too many. The one that's 
recent is our T-cells program. I don't know if

12:31.920 --> 12:33.481
you've heard of that. I've read about it, but no 
one's ever told me about it before.

12:39.647 --> 12:45.433
Again, in the structure that we're in, very often 
it's easy to have a situation where a guy's been

12:47.337 --> 12:54.044
working his heart out for 10, 20 years, and nobody 
really knows.

12:57.828 --> 12:59.749
And on the one hand, he worked for TEAS. And on the 
one hand, he worked for the university. And the

13:01.852 --> 13:05.836
university says, well, he does his research at 
TEAS. So TEAS should do whatever recognition

13:05.876 --> 13:09.900
should be done. And on the other hand, TEAS says, 
well, he's a faculty member. We're just here to

13:15.325 --> 13:17.327
provide a few opportunities. So when I came over, 
one of the things that I thought might be useful in

13:18.235 --> 13:42.201
making everybody feel like there was a team and 
that research over the long period was valuable

13:18.235 --> 13:42.201
and rewardable is I started the Monograph Series 
and I started the Teeth Fellows Program. The Teeth

13:42.221 --> 13:45.424
Fellows Program was endowed tease money at a 
million dollars to produce roughly $100,000 a

13:45.843 --> 13:53.512
year. And what we do with that is look for the top 20 
researchers in the experiment station and give

13:53.532 --> 14:12.694
them a $5,000 award for anything they want to do 
that is legal in the state. Many of them are buying

14:13.450 --> 14:22.080
their own computers that they take home, and then 
they work at home, plug into, you know, really it's

14:13.450 --> 14:22.080
a great investment. Some of them do international 
travel, or both. But the point is, they don't have

14:27.706 --> 14:36.857
to, when an opportunity comes up, they don't have 
to ask the department head for money, they don't

14:27.706 --> 14:36.857
have to ask us for money, they don't have to ask 
anybody for money. They just go and do it. This is

14:38.780 --> 14:41.903
$5,000 to apply to their research? Research and 
professional development, right. And $5,000 of

14:44.685 --> 14:53.253
the flexible money is, say, worth a $50,000 
contract because it is entirely flexible. And so

14:53.273 --> 14:56.897
we have done two years now of this. We started out 
with 12, and then we now have 20. About two of those

15:04.383 --> 15:06.205
are... visiting people, so it gives an 
opportunity to attract people to come here from

15:06.539 --> 15:15.069
Germany or France, wherever the coverage are. 
Most of those are for the senior type researchers

15:15.089 --> 15:21.176
that I've already explained that have given a 
lifetime of research, and this is a reward. And

15:21.997 --> 15:27.404
then a small amount of them for Bible, to recognize 
extremely bright young kids. And give them a

15:27.944 --> 15:33.711
little, say, gee, you're doing good, you know, 
you're not perfect, but go do some more. And so

15:34.501 --> 15:35.802
that's what we've been using it for. And we meet two 
or three times a year with them, have luncheon and

15:36.163 --> 15:39.346
so forth. And we have no pressure on them to perform 
anything. Just to give them a feeling they're part

15:43.350 --> 15:50.357
of a professional team and their work is 
recognized and appreciated. And I think it's

15:50.377 --> 16:02.449
built a lot of good feeling and helped to develop a 
less competitive environment for them to be

15:50.377 --> 16:02.449
working together. We charge those fellows, 
especially the senior ones, their job, if

16:02.952 --> 16:12.822
anything, is to act like a steward to the younger 
faculty and bring them along. If they're looking

16:12.842 --> 16:17.207
for something to do, be a mentor. So that's what we 
approach them with. I think that has helped the

16:20.811 --> 16:22.132
visibility team. Yes. Right. These two things 
were ideas that I had that I thought would improve

16:24.435 --> 16:32.183
the visibility, improve prove the fact that, you 
know, a lot of people would say, well, geez, all

16:34.154 --> 16:42.984
they want to do is just get a lot of research, and 
they're not really interested in what the

16:34.154 --> 16:42.984
research is. And, you know, in the bottom line, 
there's always that element to it, but I thought

16:43.004 --> 16:54.016
that might break that a little bit and give a little 
better feeling about that. Who chooses these

16:54.036 --> 16:55.257
folks? We have a system-wide committee. It's a 
proposed representative of the president's

16:57.339 --> 17:02.625
office using Charlie McCann and Chuck McCann. I'm 
a representative of the dean's office.

17:08.765 --> 17:14.632
Two TEAS division heads, which I rotate, and 
myself. And we take in 40, 50 nominations from the

17:14.652 --> 17:19.377
division heads. We evaluate it. And it's not only 
open to faculty. We have a senior researcher. His

17:28.067 --> 17:29.689
name is Reed. He's a Korean guy that's been here 
many years and worked for the Food Protein Center.

17:33.740 --> 17:35.703
We have two from the College of Business. We have a 
business technology group. We have Dr. Daft, and

17:38.486 --> 17:51.183
Dr. who stays in director of that thing.

17:52.745 --> 17:53.867
We have two from there. So it's not just 
engineering, it's T's wide, but it's mainly

17:53.887 --> 17:57.992
engineering. Has the interdisciplinary aspect

17:59.558 --> 18:05.785
changed much? Well, it's a very difficult thing to 
do. You probably know. But it is a unique thing that

18:11.191 --> 18:17.639
we can do that never fails to excite people from the 
outside. If you tell them that you're capable of

18:17.659 --> 18:24.667
involving multidisciplinary teams, they just 
think that's terrific. They don't see that at

18:24.687 --> 18:27.630
other universities. Frankly, it's a very 
difficult thing to do. If we do do it, we don't do it

18:30.406 --> 18:35.071
as successfully as we'd like to. There's a lot of 
pressures to compartmentalize things. But it's a

18:41.678 --> 18:47.184
very valuable and useful thing, certainly in 
engineering, to be able to do this. You can begin to

18:47.204 --> 18:53.931
look at much more complex, more meaningful 
problems if you're able to do that. You can't look

18:53.951 --> 18:56.093
at a problem like water. Has this

18:57.845 --> 19:16.815
striving

18:57.845 --> 19:16.815
for interdisciplinary

18:57.845 --> 19:16.815
cooperation been here since you've been here? 
more strong lately. It's something that we're

19:20.342 --> 19:22.664
trying to do. I think it's beginning to be 
recognized that we're trying to keep those paths

19:22.684 --> 19:28.750
open. Like I said, it's difficult. Is there 
anything else you'd like to add about TEAS or its

19:31.432 --> 19:38.178
role or anything that I haven't asked you about? I 
think you asked some good questions.

19:42.122 --> 19:47.747
No, I don't know if there's anything useful and I 
think, I hope I've told what I think is the real

19:48.082 --> 20:00.273
story of research and how TEAS is not. TEAS is 
basically individual faculty members doing what

20:01.454 --> 20:04.857
they want to do. And we provide the umbrella. The 
university is the same thing, way too. The

20:12.263 --> 20:14.125
university may say they're doing a whole bunch of 
stuff. What it is is a bunch of individuals working

20:14.145 --> 20:17.768
for themselves in more or less loosely connected 
areas. And that's not bad. But that's easy the same

20:24.272 --> 20:33.383
way,

20:24.272 --> 20:33.383
except even more so, because the element of proof 
is the international and national competition.

20:36.447 --> 20:38.229
We direct very little. But the amount that we do 
have to direct, we unfailingly do in a very

20:38.249 --> 20:44.776
leveraged way. In other words, we start things. 
get them going, but we never stand back and say

20:48.241 --> 20:58.696
we're going to pay for this operation for the next 
20 years out of our limited resources. It can't

21:00.118 --> 21:11.876
really fly its own one way or the other, and it 
probably doesn't need to be here, or it needs to be

21:00.118 --> 21:11.876
at the University of Columbia, and they'll make it 
free. Okay. Thank you for your time.
