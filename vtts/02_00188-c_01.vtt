WEBVTT

00:06.511 --> 00:09.373
No, too, because we were only 11 grades. Yeah. And 
what, were you planning to go to college? Oh, yeah.

00:13.998 --> 00:14.218
All right. I went there. How did you get back and 
forth from here to Bryan High? Driving a first one,

00:21.384 --> 00:26.168
I was driving a 28 Hummel sedan. You drove the car 
yourself? Yeah. How many other kids drove their

00:29.311 --> 00:31.573
car to school? I don't know. Not that one. And 
describe that Hupmobile. A big old six-cylinder,

00:39.631 --> 00:45.041
four-door. What color? Blue. And let's see, did it 
have a regular gear shift? Yeah. Cloth top or hard

00:56.502 --> 00:57.865
top? That's what I thought. The first one to come in 
with that hardtop would be a 37 Ford. And did

01:11.422 --> 01:14.184
anybody ride with you, or did you go by yourself? 
Well, I drove it all by myself for the first year.

01:19.729 --> 01:22.792
And then, of course, my sister came on, too. And so 
we drove together there. The other sister came

01:29.587 --> 01:32.171
along. Did anybody fuss at your parents or at you 
about your not going to A&M Consolidated? No. That

01:39.403 --> 01:41.547
didn't matter? No problem at all. Did you think 
that this was a better school than what you had

01:47.697 --> 01:51.583
gotten? Yeah, quite a lot better. Because they 
didn't have any manual training. What about

02:00.516 --> 02:02.698
science courses? What science courses did you 
take in high school? Oh, I don't know what that lady

02:06.202 --> 02:10.687
was. Her name was Klein. She taught the science. 
Did you have physics, biology, chemistry?

02:19.397 --> 02:22.881
Well, it was just a general Physics, I guess you 
would call it. How much math? We had all the math.

02:33.884 --> 02:38.190
Were there some teachers you had that you now 
realize were very effective? Yeah, particularly

02:39.232 --> 02:41.936
in English. Who?

02:47.836 --> 02:56.044
Whether

02:47.836 --> 02:56.044
I can remember that woman's name or not, but she's 
kind of a small woman. She was tough.

02:59.788 --> 03:00.709
She was tough. Did you and your Bryan High School 
buddies ever do any pranks or tricks? I never was

03:07.697 --> 03:09.098
around up there. I was admitted to school because I 
went. So you didn't get involved in any mischief?

03:14.023 --> 03:15.885
No, I didn't get involved in any mischief. Did you 
take part in any extracurricular activities?

03:21.610 --> 03:22.771
Athletics, band? No, see, I couldn't. As I told 
you, I couldn't. In my younger years, I couldn't do

03:29.659 --> 03:32.302
much or anything. I can today. And in those high 
school age years, what did you do in the summer? We

03:41.813 --> 03:44.517
traveled. Where? Well, let's see, in 1928 we went 
to the ASHV, no, not the

03:46.831 --> 04:15.032
ASHV, the ASAE, ASAE society, on the train to Salt 
Lake City to,

03:46.831 --> 04:15.032
what's the one up in there? Lake Tahoe. We were 
there in 28. My, my. And Rockefeller was on the

04:25.661 --> 04:32.069
campus. You can see that on the wind, yeah. I was 
walking around there with a high collar, old and

04:33.872 --> 04:38.037
black. What kind of personality did he seem to 
have? We wouldn't even touch him. The only thing

04:46.940 --> 04:52.549
about that place was that you couldn't swim.

04:55.234 --> 05:04.228
What we did, we went out to the end of the pier, and 
you could read a damn newspaper down there, I don't

04:55.234 --> 05:04.228
know how far down. The water was that clear? That 
clear. And all you had to do was, you just made up

05:08.135 --> 05:13.183
your mind, and you just, You dove off into that 
thing, and then you turned around, and you climbed

05:13.687 --> 05:20.256
back that ladder as quick as you could. Water was 
that cold? Cold. Deliciously cold. All right, so

05:26.064 --> 05:28.047
where, and you went there. Where else did you go in 
the summers? We went to, that year we went to

05:30.190 --> 05:40.825
San Francisco, and we stayed there a while. And 
then we got on a boat, a coastal steamer, and went to

05:41.041 --> 05:51.031
Portland. And I was the only one that didn't get 
seasick out of all of us. We got to Portland, and

05:57.297 --> 06:10.170
then we went to—on the train from Portland, we went 
to Vancouver, and then across the—across the

06:11.365 --> 06:12.747
an island out there. And then we went back to 
Canadian Vancouver.

06:25.521 --> 06:40.377
Well, first we went to Seattle and then we came back 
to

06:25.521 --> 06:40.377
Vancouver. And we got on the Canadian Railway

06:40.795 --> 06:46.960
and went to Banff. Have you been there? No. There's 
one more place you ought to go. All right, other

06:53.586 --> 06:56.108
summers, where did you go?

06:59.571 --> 07:09.300
Well,

06:59.571 --> 07:09.300
the next year we go at...

07:12.908 --> 07:40.840
hub mobile to up to northern Minnesota two harbors 
on the north side of the up there and then we went to

07:12.908 --> 07:40.840
Canada one day came back with a bunch of Canadian 
blankets have you seen one of those black, some of

07:41.967 --> 07:49.818
them black, some had some white ones with the 
stripe all the way across the top. Those things, we

07:49.838 --> 08:10.506
were all, we had a hell of a time getting them back in 
there because we went across there to port, Huron I

07:49.838 --> 08:10.506
guess it is or some port and then we turned around 
almost too quick and people that didn't like it.

08:14.458 --> 08:15.780
Daddy talked them out of it. So then we came back 
from that and we drove down to

08:17.362 --> 08:29.657
Redwood Falls, Minnesota. My father had his

08:29.677 --> 08:38.367
brother, his uncle. was living in Redwood Falls, 
Minnesota. So you got to see some family. Yeah, the

08:44.013 --> 08:45.215
old man, yeah. And he had gone out there after my 
grandfather had died. And

08:55.028 --> 09:02.278
they had tuberculosis, and they had Cromwell. and 
they all split and so he had gone to out there in east

09:03.473 --> 09:22.116
western Minnesota and I remember that to this day. 
Walked up there and there's a young man there and

09:22.917 --> 09:32.248
later we've seen him since and He asked if it's 
Elmer. Is Elmer here? Told him who we were and he

09:40.686 --> 09:43.008
understood. And so we went in there and the old man 
was raising honey. What he loved to do was he had a

09:50.836 --> 09:59.164
bunch of honeybees and he was raising honey for

10:02.283 --> 10:04.025
Oh, it's clover honey. It's very sweet. And so we 
walked in there and I can hear dad yell, I'm Will's

10:08.809 --> 10:15.254
boy. Will's boy. Just yelling at him. Just yelling 
at him on top of his voice. And finally the old man

10:24.142 --> 10:26.024
lightened up.

10:29.166 --> 10:31.108
And he sure got it. he come out of there and of course 
he was he was in his he was quite old i don't know how

10:31.645 --> 10:58.227
old he would have been but anyways he was just uh 
finally got warmed up to where dad who dad was and he

10:31.645 --> 10:58.227
was so glad to see him We've kept up with those 
people. See, that's what this is from. All this

11:05.204 --> 11:06.265
stuff here. Now, you traveled some in the summer. 
Did you have summer jobs also? Yeah, I had one.

11:12.170 --> 11:13.231
What'd you do? Well, Dad got it in 1934. Dad got me a 
job at South Dakota State at Brookings for the

11:17.415 --> 11:26.164
whole summer. What'd you do? Well, they were... 
They were interested in rammed earth

11:30.826 --> 11:39.879
construction, where you ram the earth and then you 
just let her stand. And they had gone all over South

11:41.461 --> 11:51.976
Dakota and picked up all the different types of 
soil that they had there. And they brought them

11:52.657 --> 11:54.659
back into this one. And they had rammed them into 
this one great big old wall that they had up there

11:56.162 --> 12:00.748
that they built. and uh so my job for that was that's 
what i really and i had to go out there and cut some of

12:02.129 --> 12:31.427
that dirt out of the way and where they had rods 
through there and stick and put concrete in there

12:02.129 --> 12:31.427
and seal it off so that hole that rod that went 
through that He had two walls and they had these

12:32.470 --> 12:36.235
rods between them. And they ran those things. And 
they pulled in and they pulled the bolt out. My job

12:43.526 --> 12:51.737
was to fix that up and get it ready to, they were 
going to struggle with it. So that was one thing.

12:55.022 --> 12:59.929
And then the other thing was that I just worked in 
the shops there. And one morning,

13:01.208 --> 13:15.403
I was just sitting there, working around in there 
and straightening up things. And this man came in

13:16.984 --> 13:18.626
through there. And I've never seen a man so mad hot. 
Oh, that man was hot. He was really hot. He says,

13:31.870 --> 13:36.615
come fix this damn tractor.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.118
What had happened? He'd gone out there and he was 
plowing that field that night before. And he was

13:45.243 --> 13:51.330
plowing it with a Case cross-engine tractor. Big 
old four-cylinder cross-engine. It sticked

13:53.151 --> 13:55.634
crossways a little bit. And so he had just stopped 
out there, cut the engine off, and then he went, the

14:00.220 --> 14:16.403
next morning when he went out there, he

14:00.220 --> 14:16.403
just, well, I'll just go start it up again. He was 
already fueled up and everything, I guess. So he

14:21.891 --> 14:26.177
went out there and that crank was about 42 inches 
off the ground. Very big old thing. And so he had to

14:34.372 --> 14:41.038
stand out there and just crank it off his hand like 
that. Well, some of their people there in the

14:43.120 --> 14:52.570
department had rebuilt the magneto on that 
tractor. And they used ordinary shellac, not

14:54.727 --> 15:00.614
electrical shellac. It wouldn't stand the heat. 
So when he stopped that tractor and that heat got

15:05.801 --> 15:17.074
all over that mag, it stuck the rotor.

15:17.094 --> 15:19.557
Between the mag and the rotor. And when he was 
cranking it, That impulse coupling that's on

15:24.241 --> 15:34.470
there,

15:24.241 --> 15:34.470
it's a wind-up arrangement on the spring, is what 
it went to. And you just wind it, and you hear it

15:35.551 --> 15:37.532
click. And you're supposed to fire that cylinder. 
Well, it didn't until the last time. And all of a

15:46.040 --> 15:50.504
sudden, it turned loose. And it backfired on all 
four cylinders. And he just went up from there, and

15:53.823 --> 16:07.684
about 30 yards out there in the field, I found two 
handprints and two knee prints. Luckily, he had

16:07.704 --> 16:12.050
fallen on the soft earth again. Now, was that job in 
1934, was that while you were in college? Yeah. All

16:17.578 --> 16:18.520
right, let's back up. Well, let me finish this. Oh, 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well. They were so poor. I

16:26.205 --> 16:30.230
took it all apart, the tractor apart. And they had 
used Model A spark plugs in them, which were too

16:30.250 --> 16:35.877
long. And they were burning the tips off of them. 
And so then I had to go. They were so poor that I had to

16:44.088 --> 16:49.835
go to the president of the college. And he had to go 
downtown and buy the... Those spark plugs. My

16:55.647 --> 16:56.408
goodness. That's how poor they were up there. And 
they had a whole dormitory full of women over

17:02.916 --> 17:07.462
there. Right now, you mentioned poor. Describe as 
fully as you can what depression, what the

17:12.187 --> 17:20.758
depression was like here at Texas A&M. It was not 
bad. You see, we got the Texas A&M people, the

17:25.370 --> 17:37.385
students and the professors were lucky. See, 
Texas has a, we have a biannual appropriation, all

17:37.405 --> 17:43.933
right. They had already made the appropriation. 
They couldn't change it and so what happened was

17:52.049 --> 18:21.853
that we dead had a pretty good salary there for 
quite a while and so then what happened was that

17:52.049 --> 18:21.853
they reduced it down in the next biennium and so the 
legislature made a tone that that the women and the

18:22.188 --> 18:36.140
The

18:22.188 --> 18:36.140
daughters and the women of

18:22.188 --> 18:36.140
the professors could go here to school. And there 
were 15 to 17 of them that did. Now this is what, do

18:40.423 --> 18:42.785
you remember about when that was? That would be in 
about 1933.

18:49.291 --> 18:50.572
Did any of your sisters go? Yes, both of them. How 
were they treated? Wonderful.

18:57.712 --> 18:59.054
They got along real good. They liked it? They liked 
it. They made some real good friends. And the boys

19:03.359 --> 19:06.203
liked it, to have girls in the class? I don't know. I 
never had a girl in mine, but

19:09.247 --> 19:16.937
they did. I know a bunch of them. My sister, we were 
talking about it the other night, the other

19:22.398 --> 19:27.745
afternoon. We were over at Luby's. She was talking 
about it. And she told me, and there was a, in the

19:32.992 --> 19:41.724
battalion, there was, right in the middle, there 
was a page in there with all her pictures. And she's

19:43.306 --> 19:46.650
still got that battalion. Now we're, and these 
were faculty daughters. Faculty daughters or...

19:50.427 --> 19:52.970
Staff daughters. Staff daughters. But nobody, no 
other women were allowed. But they did

19:58.437 --> 20:11.273
immediately, I think after that, they did let the, 
in summer school, let women go.

20:12.415 --> 20:15.659
Now, were you all still living on the campus when 
the Depression hit? No. You had moved off. We moved

20:18.503 --> 20:19.624
off, yes. Dad

20:20.347 --> 20:49.071
he designed the house that we're living in and I 
remember him going we went all over this town there

20:20.347 --> 20:49.071
were several houses in here that he was looking at 
he wanted an overhang on that house it's three feet

20:20.347 --> 20:49.071
sticks out three feet this way flat and then of 
course you got the big roof on top of it but then He

20:50.418 --> 20:54.283
designed it, and then he got a contractor. And it 
was a whole turnkey job. And see, that has a

20:59.791 --> 21:02.014
basement under it, too. It had a furnace in it. All 
of that was $75 million. Do you remember what year

21:10.206 --> 21:11.528
that was?

21:14.752 --> 21:19.759
That would be in 20, that would be in 24, because 
that's when we moved into it. Okay, okay. We moved

21:20.607 --> 21:29.576
into it on the 17th of November in 1924. And so... 
December. It would be December, not November. All

21:33.339 --> 21:40.186
right, so you all are off campus, and the house is 
paid for and all, and the Depression hits. But what

21:41.407 --> 21:46.091
about the effects of the Depression on the 
community here? Oh, for any of them, not any. What

21:50.408 --> 21:51.289
about in Bryan? There was quite a lot of problems. 
There were a lot of problems there. We never

21:59.020 --> 22:10.016
were...

21:59.020 --> 22:10.016
We never did know too much about them. They didn't 
have any people. Well, the people just took care of

22:14.442 --> 22:19.369
other people, not doctors, for one thing. The 
doctor never turned down a patient. And then some

22:24.615 --> 22:40.914
of the Negro, some of the, one of them I know, they'd 
bring him up there to his house, and he would never

22:24.615 --> 22:40.914
take it in the house, but he'd, some Negro gets 
hurt, you know. He'd just lay one of us on the

22:40.934 --> 22:47.922
driveway out there and patch him up.

22:48.188 --> 22:56.096
The hospital was the old St. Joseph's north of the 
business district? No, you know, Horton and

22:56.116 --> 23:01.361
Bryan? No, it was that one that's on near the, I 
don't know what the name of that street is, goes

23:01.501 --> 23:10.890
west. That's where it is. It's not I think they 
converted that into some sort of a... Retirement

23:18.074 --> 23:22.380
home. Retirement home. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that 
one. The building there. Yeah. But before that, it

23:27.847 --> 23:35.236
was down there near the courthouse. You know, 
there's a building down there. That's where they

23:37.660 --> 23:39.061
took my father. He had his gallbladder out in 1932. 
Now, here on the campus... Were you faculty

23:48.770 --> 23:55.597
youngsters, were you eligible to go to the quack 
shack on the campus? The hospital? Oh, yeah. Dr.

24:00.202 --> 24:03.005
Ellinger treated me. Dr. Marsh treated me. There

24:05.788 --> 24:15.317
were two of the Ellingers. The old man. Now he was a 
specialist in

24:17.609 --> 24:32.148
respiratory disease, principally pneumonia. 
Now I've heard that Dr. Marsh delivered some

24:32.168 --> 24:40.919
children at the homes on the campus. Well that was 
done all over the country. Matter of fact, My wife,

24:48.406 --> 24:51.729
I'm sure, was on there. What they usually did, they 
went into the living room or the dining room. You

25:00.737 --> 25:02.059
had a big old table. And put the mother on the table? 
Yeah. They made a bed on top of the table and put her

25:06.703 --> 25:11.467
up there. And that was the usual procedure. One of 
the Cashion boys told me that Dr. Marsh and his wife

25:15.878 --> 25:32.281
had a commitment for dinner, and his mother went 
into labor, and so Dr. Marsh came over to their

25:15.878 --> 25:32.281
house and delivered him a little early so they 
could still make it to the dinner party. Describe

25:34.544 --> 25:36.627
Dr. Marsh as you remember him. I never did. You 
didn't? Dr. Ellinger. But you think highly of him.

25:43.722 --> 25:45.144
Dr. Ellinger? Dr. Marsh was the one. I was talking 
about Schultz.

25:54.435 --> 26:04.348
His

25:54.435 --> 26:04.348
father told me that South Oakwood, he lived right 
there. We knew each other because we backed up to

26:04.428 --> 26:09.013
his property. He was down there. He got hurt one 
day. And somehow or another, I don't know what it

26:13.287 --> 26:26.626
was, something they had these, they made

26:13.287 --> 26:26.626
syrup.

26:29.450 --> 26:34.437
You took sorghum

26:29.450 --> 26:34.437
and run it through a mill. And then you took it in 
there and cooked it off. Made molasses. Well, you

26:39.964 --> 26:42.568
also made sorghum. Well, sorghum molasses is what 
we called it. Well, somehow or another, he got his

26:48.237 --> 26:54.527
arm into this machine. And Dr. Morris was a young 
doctor then. Just come to town. I asked him about it

27:03.861 --> 27:08.128
here just not more than a couple years ago. I asked 
him about the whole thing. I said, I knew you were

27:12.367 --> 27:15.111
you're injured, but I didn't know what it was at 
all. But he said Dr. Marsh was in there. And Dr.

27:19.397 --> 27:25.567
Marsh wouldn't, the doctors wanted to cut his arm 
off. He was a regular doctor. And Dr. Marsh went in

27:28.731 --> 27:33.979
there and he said, don't cut that man's arm off. And 
he worked with it. and worked with him until they

27:39.957 --> 27:44.583
got the bone back in the place. And that man served 
in the Air Force. Good. Never requested it. Oh,

27:53.714 --> 27:54.935
good. So you understand what his...

28:03.045 --> 28:07.330
So I always thought that he was a good man. And there 
were others... I don't know, they just seemed to,

28:10.805 --> 28:19.516
they had a good staff. And another thing they had 
was, there was the nurses.

28:27.126 --> 28:27.707
Were they good? Excellent. And one of them one day, 
they couldn't find a doctor, and this kid had come

28:31.311 --> 28:39.782
down with a, a hell of a hurt in the right side, and 
she knew what was wrong. She

28:48.432 --> 29:04.757
took all her help that she could find and some more, 
and she went in there and cut that appendix out all

28:48.432 --> 29:04.757
by herself. My, my. Who was that youngster? Do you 
know? I don't know the name of the youngster. But it

29:11.765 --> 29:13.628
worked successfully. Yeah, and I remember she was 
at the American Legion when I first went out there.

29:28.407 --> 29:29.989
There were some tough women around. Take on 
responsibility. Another thing I always found,

29:34.302 --> 29:57.977
that the wife of

29:34.302 --> 29:57.977
an officer or men in service, I mean, where the 
woman had to do a lot of even shipping or taking care

29:34.302 --> 29:57.977
of things. Sure. They made the best people you 
could find, even if they were in the... I kind of,

30:03.817 --> 30:12.352
well, they were supposed to work, but they didn't 
work. In the 20s and early 30s, what did your mother

30:13.594 --> 30:19.625
do for pleasure? What social groups did she... Oh, 
she went with...

30:33.128 --> 30:41.258
civic clubs and the women around on the campus had a 
bunch of civic clubs that they worked with. But in

30:42.920 --> 30:58.240
addition, my father realized that she was going to 
have some problems and so he got her interested in

30:42.920 --> 30:58.240
birds. In what? Birds.

31:03.925 --> 31:17.223
And we have some birds in our, I've not found them 
yet, but he bought all the books that you could find

31:03.925 --> 31:17.223
on birds. Oh, how marvelous. Including the 
ottomans. He had some of the big original models.

31:30.181 --> 31:32.464
I think my sister's got it. All right, a 
suggestion. If the family is ever willing to part

31:37.210 --> 31:47.259
with any of those, please give them to this library 
so that your family's name would always be there.

31:48.299 --> 31:53.504
If y'all ever want to pass them on outside the 
family, give them to the Texas A&M Library. We've

31:54.205 --> 31:56.326
done that to a number of things. Well, that's 
great, because...

31:56.346 --> 32:02.772
We discovered... a

32:04.473 --> 32:28.236
book that the

32:04.473 --> 32:28.236
cemetery had out there, at the Bryan Cemetery, and 
it describes all, what the only problem is, it

32:04.473 --> 32:28.236
shouldn't be, I'm glad that colleges got it, 
because you could get sued over it.
