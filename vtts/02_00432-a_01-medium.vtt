00:01.550 --> 00:08.758
General George Beverly, United States Air Force, 
retired. Today is Thursday, July 16, 1981. This is

00:16.807 --> 00:22.633
Terry Anderson in Del Rio, Texas. This is a test.

00:33.275 --> 00:36.981
Today's interview is with Brigadier General 
George Beverly. It is July 16, 1981. This is Terry

00:39.785 --> 00:41.548
Henderson. You were born? Amarillo, Texas. Back 
in May 27, 1897. Okay.

00:54.467 --> 00:57.612
Let's start by talking about your grandfather and 
your parents. Tell me about your family. Well,

01:03.135 --> 01:21.980
family history goes way back into England, but my 
grandfather moved

01:03.135 --> 01:21.980
from Henderson, Kentucky to Goliad, near Goliad, 
Texas by ox cart in 1853. Brought along all his

01:23.643 --> 01:26.907
household goods and his slaves acquired two 
plantations near Goliad, Texas, and he prospered

01:27.562 --> 01:54.733
very well there until the Civil War, which time he 
lost his slaves and the family had a little

01:27.562 --> 01:54.733
difficulty adjusting, of course, and moved up to 
San Antonio to put the children in school. And my

01:56.232 --> 02:09.891
older brother, I mean his oldest son, my father, 
had to go to work to help the family out when he was

01:56.232 --> 02:09.891
about 12 years old. So he didn't get a great deal of 
schooling. But he became a trail driver when

02:14.817 --> 02:25.412
he was about 17. He went up the trail the first time 
in 1871 with the herd and then he went up. Where were

02:32.885 --> 02:34.026
they driving the herds? To Kansas at that time. I 
believe they were going into Abilene and the last

02:36.248 --> 02:48.242
herd he took up was several years later about I 
would guess 1877. He was trail boss at that time.

02:53.354 --> 02:59.460
about 23 years old, which speaks pretty well for 
his ability. Sure. I expect to have about 4,000

03:02.063 --> 03:06.267
head of cattle. Did he ever tell you about those 
conditions? Well yes, he talked about, he didn't

03:11.132 --> 03:14.916
talk much about it. He said they were stopped by 
Indians in Indian territory and They would not

03:22.227 --> 03:36.482
give the Indians a beef or a steer because that 
would denote to the Indians that they were worried

03:22.227 --> 03:36.482
and maybe afraid of them. They made the Indians 
trade blankets for any steers that they gave them.

03:45.291 --> 03:49.315
But otherwise they had no trouble with the 
Indians.

03:52.754 --> 04:12.196
On his last trip, on the way back, he and his cowboys 
ran into a bunch of about nine buffalo and they shot

03:52.754 --> 04:12.196
some of them and roped some of them and I think they 
wiped out the whole nine head.

04:17.282 --> 04:19.605
What trail? Yeah, I think it was the Chisholm 
Trail, and my grandfather moved to Dodge City with

04:19.906 --> 04:40.243
the family in 18, about 1880,

04:19.906 --> 04:40.243
or 1870 sometime, and We went into partnership 
with Bob Wright, who was mayor of Dodge City and we

04:41.152 --> 04:58.959
opened a mercantile store called Wright and 
Beverly and did a flourishing business with the

04:41.152 --> 04:58.959
Texas Trail Drivers there for several years. 
That's where my father met my mother. She lived in

05:05.409 --> 05:09.876
Cairo, Illinois and came out to Dodge City to visit 
some of her relatives during the summer and that's

05:10.733 --> 05:18.246
where they had met her. Your grandfather met her? 
That my father met her. Oh, okay. Okay. My mother,

05:25.718 --> 05:32.810
they were married in 1992, moved to Amarillo, 
Texas. That's where I was born. And why'd they

05:34.773 --> 05:35.695
move? Well I don't know. He was looking for a job I 
guess and he got a job as manager of the row ranch,

05:39.065 --> 06:04.652
R-O-W-E, row ranch at several thousands of acres 
north of Clarendon and I don't know how many

05:39.065 --> 06:04.652
thousand head of cattle they had but it was quite 
one of the largest ranches in the Panhandle. He got

06:05.172 --> 06:15.946
the job as manager of that, but he moved the family 
to Amarillo and bought a home there. And that's

06:15.966 --> 06:22.574
where I was born and my older brother and one of my 
younger brothers.

06:25.398 --> 06:27.160
How many children in the family? There were five of 
us. My father's family, there were eight. He had

06:32.988 --> 06:38.554
seven brothers and sisters.

06:38.574 --> 06:42.839
Our family, I had three brothers and one sister.

06:45.802 --> 06:48.685
How'd you get along with them when you were growing 
up? Oh, I didn't get along too well with my older

06:48.705 --> 06:56.273
brother, but he was bossy. And I knocked the front 
tooth out for him one time when he had me down on the

06:57.637 --> 07:05.425
road. And I just reached back and got a rock and 
knocked the front tooth out. And he had to have it

07:08.968 --> 07:10.249
replaced. It cost him about $10, $15 at that time.

07:16.535 --> 07:20.780
But I got along fine with my younger brother. He was 
a year and a half younger than I am. And then my

07:25.164 --> 07:27.306
sister was born. Carlsbad, New Mexico, where 
after the family had moved from Amarillo to

07:27.860 --> 07:32.205
Carlsbad. Why'd they move down there? They moved 
down there on account of my mother's health. She

07:38.011 --> 07:44.779
had tuberculosis and she thought it would be 
better in climate for her down there and he did too.

07:45.199 --> 07:53.749
So he went to, the whole family moved to Carlsbad in 
1902 and Dad got the job down there as manager of the

07:55.366 --> 08:05.760
Turkey Truck Ranch, which was a large ranch 
between Carlsbad and Roswell, New Mexico. I don't

08:07.423 --> 08:12.409
know if it's still in existence or not, but it was 
quite a large ranch. While he was manager of that

08:13.491 --> 08:23.685
ranch, he had some trouble with a couple of cowboys 
and he fired and they threatened to kill him. So he

08:25.133 --> 08:41.658
rode into Roswell and bought himself a .45 single 
action, and he had to wear that while those boys

08:25.133 --> 08:41.658
were in their vicinity, those young, two young men 
that he fired, but they never did go through with

08:25.133 --> 08:41.658
their threat to killing. Then in 1906, my Uncle Jim 
and my father bought a ranch and 12 miles west of

08:52.943 --> 09:02.805
Channing, Texas, which is close to Dalhart there, 
between Amarillo and Dalhart. And it was 12 miles

09:04.047 --> 09:10.181
south of Dalhart and 12 miles west of Channing in 
the Rita Blanca Canyon. It's called the Old

09:11.043 --> 09:12.927
Marshall Place. and it was right next door to the 
XIT main headquarters. Why'd they decide to move

09:18.881 --> 09:20.803
back to Texas? How was your mother's health at that 
time? Dad just wanted to get back to Pan Am, I guess,

09:25.228 --> 09:31.295
in the ranching business. Well, they followed 
along,

09:31.315 --> 09:41.766
but while from 1906 to 1910,

09:43.687 --> 10:13.407
mother stayed at Carlsbad and my younger brother 
Henry and I and the first year in 1906 we went by

09:43.687 --> 10:13.407
train up to Channing and stayed on the ranch that 
summer

09:43.687 --> 10:13.407
and my older brother James and mother stayed in 
Carlsbad where she gave birth to my only sister

09:43.687 --> 10:13.407
Beatrice Then in 1907, 8 and 9, why the whole family 
went up to Willis Springs Ranch for the summer and

10:14.703 --> 10:26.288
went back to Carlsbad for the winter school term. 
Then in 1910, why he moved the whole family up to

10:28.272 --> 10:32.942
Dalhart, Texas. That's where I went to high 
school.

10:40.724 --> 10:44.509
Could you tell me about the type of man your father 
was? Well, he always said that his word was as good

10:45.751 --> 10:51.338
as his bond. He was strictly honest and never tried 
to beat anybody out of anything. He was not too

10:58.948 --> 11:07.219
smart as a businessman or money wise. We never had 
much money. We had enough to eat, and from the time I

11:09.817 --> 11:26.663
was eight or 10, I was out helping with the family 
finances by selling Saturday evening posts and

11:09.817 --> 11:26.663
anything else I could, job I could get. And I

11:28.686 --> 11:36.178
took stenography,

11:37.120 --> 11:56.226
in high school and earned money typing for the 
county clerk and typing up leads at that time and

11:37.120 --> 11:56.226
worked for various businessmen there, an 
abstract company,

11:37.120 --> 11:56.226
Ballard Abstract Company.

11:58.689 --> 12:06.520
I saved my money and after I graduated from high 
school at Ballard, I went to Texas A&M for two years

12:06.938 --> 12:08.520
I paid all my own expenses. Did you tell me a little 
bit about your mother? What type of person she was?

12:14.149 --> 12:16.292
Well, mother was a very beautiful woman. She was

12:17.614 --> 12:27.108
handicapped by the fact that she had a rude, hungry 
children to feed and didn't have much money. But

12:28.429 --> 12:36.321
she used to buy cornflakes, for instance, by the 
crate. feed us on skim milk. We couldn't afford

12:39.391 --> 12:43.678
fresh milk, whole milk. So the dairyman would sell 
us a gallon of skim milk for 10 cents and

12:43.698 --> 13:04.350
occasionally if he had extra whole milk why he'd 
just pour in the whole milk instead of the skim milk

12:43.698 --> 13:04.350
and that was a real treat for us but that's about 
that gives you some idea of the struggles she had in

13:06.085 --> 13:09.369
paying the bills. She played, well at Carlsbad she 
played the organ for the Episcopal Church and made

13:10.670 --> 13:19.060
some money that way. And at Dalhart she was one time 
telephone operator up there in the switchboard

13:20.701 --> 13:34.557
room with the hardware store at Dalhart. Was she a 
hard working woman? Well, oh yeah,

13:36.964 --> 13:46.397
she was a hard worker.

13:46.457 --> 13:50.342
She was a very fine bridge player. She belonged to 
the bridge club there in Dalhart and was probably

13:50.482 --> 13:58.834
the best bridge player in Dalhart. She was a pretty 
good piano player. She tried to teach me how to play

14:01.959 --> 14:04.442
the piano. but she just didn't have the nervous 
energy to force me to practice. I'd rather be out on

14:11.844 --> 14:23.384
the sandlot playing football with the boys and 
sitting in there practicing piano, so I never did

14:11.844 --> 14:23.384
learn to play. I did learn to play the cornet, 
played in the dial art. Dan played second coronet,

14:28.874 --> 14:33.321
I think. Who was the authority in the family, your 
mother or your father? Mother. Dad was

14:39.692 --> 14:44.800
somebody on the ranch. Whenever us boys got out of 
hand to where mother couldn't handle us, she'd get

14:47.064 --> 14:54.696
dad to come in and he'd Of course, he'd give us a 
licking that would last at least a year. He had a

14:58.947 --> 15:06.677
piece of leather trace, I don't know if you know 
what they are. It runs from the horse's collar back

15:06.837 --> 15:13.625
to the single tree or double tree. He had a piece of 
it about that thick, about that long. About 18

15:20.326 --> 15:24.271
inches long and about an inch thick? Oh no, he's 
about half an inch thick.

15:30.098 --> 15:37.147
Anyway, it was terrific licking he'd give each one 
of us and that would do us for a year at least. Mother

15:38.850 --> 15:49.303
had a rawhide riding crop that she applied to 
proper places whenever she got so exasperated she

15:38.850 --> 15:49.303
couldn't stand it any longer, but on the whole I 
guess we were an average kid. No meaner than the

15:55.243 --> 15:59.347
average. We were... You mentioned the Episcopal 
Church. Was religion important in your

16:02.531 --> 16:04.433
upbringing? Uh, yes. My mother sent us to Sunday 
school, and we Presbyterians way back in 400

16:05.654 --> 16:18.548
years. in Scotland,

16:20.384 --> 16:46.695
and we also were, went to the young man, people's,

16:20.384 --> 16:46.695
Epworth League, I believe they call it, something 
like that, the Presbyterian Church,

16:20.384 --> 16:46.695
and we went evening service sometime. I'm not too, 
I don't remember too much about that except that I

16:47.705 --> 17:04.166
do remember I joined the church when I was I guess 
about 16 or 17

16:47.705 --> 17:04.166
by confession of faith. We were all baptized when 
we were babies. Later on when I quit the

17:09.413 --> 17:17.644
Presbyterian on account of the National Council 
of Churches I went to a Christian church, the North

17:18.704 --> 17:25.377
American Christian Convention, but that was 
later. But I had to be dumped, I had to be baptized

17:26.900 --> 17:35.397
again, immersed.

17:38.093 --> 17:39.875
Getting back to Texas A&M. Well, before we move to 
Texas A&M, I want to ask you another question about

17:40.195 --> 17:45.181
your parents. You had a very successful career 
rising to the rank of general, and I was wondering

17:45.241 --> 17:53.890
in what ways do you think your parents were 
responsible for that? Well, I think that both my

17:53.910 --> 18:04.422
father and my mother instilled an idea of 
integrity. and that we wouldn't lie. We, in some

18:08.440 --> 18:27.680
cases, did occasionally lie, but that was drilled 
into us to be truthful and honest and have respect

18:08.440 --> 18:27.680
for authority.

18:27.700 --> 18:33.666
That's about all I can think of at this time that 
they instilled into us. Okay, now let's go to your

18:34.388 --> 18:40.840
education, but before we get to A&M, let's talk a 
little bit about your high school. What were your

18:40.860 --> 18:42.042
favorite subjects?

18:47.351 --> 18:51.840
Well, I was smarter than the average student. I 
don't say that egotistically, but I didn't have

18:54.588 --> 19:00.534
enough to keep me interested, to keep up with the 
class. I didn't try to excel because I'd rather be

19:01.235 --> 19:16.430
out playing baseball or football or something or 
maybe dreaming, daydreaming, but I breezed

19:01.235 --> 19:16.430
through the courses with no trouble at all. I took 
up shorthand and typewriting so I could make extra

19:17.271 --> 19:23.397
money It took a year of German. I liked my German 
teacher and I enjoyed that course. I enjoyed

19:35.773 --> 19:47.573
ancient history and

19:35.773 --> 19:47.573
I liked mathematics. Would you consider yourself 
a good student in high school? I would consider

19:51.963 --> 19:59.835
myself a non-problems student. The teachers had 
no trouble with me. I had no trouble keeping up.

20:04.602 --> 20:07.666
Were you involved with a lot of activities and 
sports? Uh, Dalhart at that time had about 3,000

20:08.808 --> 20:13.695
people. Our high school teams were I played 
football with a team for instance. We went down to

20:22.416 --> 20:29.328
Amarillo one time to play Amarillo and they beat us 
127 to nothing. Isn't that amazing? I got kicked

20:33.615 --> 20:36.460
behind the ear. 127 to nothing? I got kicked behind 
the ear, and I don't remember playing most of the

20:39.972 --> 20:54.466
game, but I have a hazy recollection of seeing 
them, they put their ends way out on the sideline,

20:39.972 --> 20:54.466
you know, and then it snapped the ball. It would go 
this end down to the, and the ball would go through

20:55.067 --> 21:03.355
there, and he'd pick it out and try to cross the goal 
line for a score. And we were just helpless. We were

21:06.378 --> 21:09.321
like a bunch of babes in their hands. At that time, I 
guess they were about as good as any team in Texas,

21:09.706 --> 21:21.822
but in baseball, I was a pretty good high school 
player. I played on the Dallard Municipal Team as a

21:21.842 --> 21:31.195
catcher in baseball. As I said, I played in a band 
and that's about the extent of my activities

21:34.748 --> 21:37.111
there. Did you consider your work, did you lead, 
did you consider yourself a leader at that time?

21:43.178 --> 21:45.741
Yes in high school, yeah. Well in grammar school 
too. I was always taking up for mistreated kids,

21:47.143 --> 22:04.063
some bullies, there's always bullies you know, 
and I was a good fighter and I was always protecting

21:47.143 --> 22:04.063
the kids who were The bullies were picking on me, 
and these bullies were afraid of me. Why do you

22:08.711 --> 22:15.161
think you'd be the one who would stand up for these 
kids? I think it's just the nature that I was born in

22:15.181 --> 22:19.808
with. I just hate injustice forcing anything on 
Eric. Of course, that comes under injustice to

22:23.813 --> 22:29.061
those kids. Anything in this world I hate, it's 
injustice. non-justice.

22:38.825 --> 22:49.221
And so you consider yourself, you see that you 
started your leadership, your long career of

22:38.825 --> 22:49.221
leadership way back when you were a teenager. In 
the first grade, I started it back in the first

22:51.260 --> 23:00.031
grade at La Huerta, New Mexico which is suburb of 
Carlsbad, New Mexico. We had a one-room

23:00.131 --> 23:19.917
schoolhouse there and about 20 students from that 
area and I think one teacher and their grades over

23:00.131 --> 23:19.917
there from the first grade on up to about the 
seventh and one thing these older boys decided

23:00.131 --> 23:19.917
that they're going to find out which one of the the 
first and second graders were the best fighters so

23:20.572 --> 23:49.077
they cleaned out a pig pen there and this this was a 
private home they cleaned out this pig pen and then

23:20.572 --> 23:49.077
they put two of us in there and we'd fight it make us 
fight so go over go to it and whoever won why he was in

23:20.572 --> 23:49.077
there against the next one and I wound up the winner 
against all the kids by anywhere near my age Then I

23:50.508 --> 23:53.151
had the first and second grade. Then I went into 
Carlsbad to school. Now were these boxing and

24:00.620 --> 24:06.787
kicking matches or were they more wrestling or 
were you just hitting and elbowing? Oh, it was just

24:06.807 --> 24:08.509
fist cuffs. When I went into Carlsbad to enter the 
third grade they gave me a test made me skip the

24:17.947 --> 24:46.266
third grade and put me in the fourth grade with the 
champion fighter there at Carlsbad I heard about

24:17.947 --> 24:46.266
me being the best fighter from the Werda area so he 
kept pestering me to fight it out see who was the

24:17.947 --> 24:46.266
best fighter and he was about that much taller than 
I was and I dodged him as long as I could but he

24:17.947 --> 24:46.266
finally got me cornered in an alley one time and 
proceeded to beat me up pretty good. I finally just

24:51.751 --> 24:54.855
quit. But he was too much for me. He later became an 
amateur champion in New Mexico,

24:57.239 --> 25:04.769
I think. But I enjoyed fighting. I enjoyed 
anything physical.

25:15.604 --> 25:17.046
Now let's go back to A&M. Why did you decide to go to 
Hampton? I had the reputation down heart of being

25:21.651 --> 25:28.761
the toughest school in Texas. The reputation of 
making it tough on anybody that would want to try to

25:28.922 --> 25:36.253
get in there. Tough on the freshmen. And I decided 
I'd like to go down and try it out. I got down there

25:44.565 --> 25:45.987
and they Did you ever think of any other 
alternative schools? No, I can't think of any. You

25:55.922 --> 25:57.784
never considered going some other place? No. Were 
you interested in the military at this time? No. So

26:04.032 --> 26:06.495
you never thought of going to West Point? No. As a 
matter of fact, I wasn't much interested in

26:08.358 --> 26:13.324
further education, I recall. I guess mother 
probably told me I should get a college education,

26:13.793 --> 26:21.762
so I always obeyed her. What did you think when you 
arrived? Well, I was a green country boy down there

26:28.169 --> 26:39.741
among all those kids from the cities and so forth. I 
was on my toes. I said, what course? I thought you'd

26:46.035 --> 26:55.711
go to college, or you'd take just whatever they 
gave you, you know, the whole business, just like

26:46.035 --> 26:55.711
you would in high school. You don't go to high 
school now, but at that time, I took everything I

26:55.731 --> 27:05.166
had in high school, and I thought I'd take 
everything I had in A&M. I said, well, someone

27:05.186 --> 27:09.413
asked me what course I was going to take, and I said, 
well, I don't know. What have they got? Somebody

27:11.422 --> 27:17.107
said, well Animal Husbandry is supposed to be the 
easiest course. I said, well I believe I'll take

27:18.569 --> 27:20.190
that. I didn't know what it was.

27:25.235 --> 27:27.317
You didn't know what Animal Husbandry was? No. I 
found out later it was out of form.

27:33.923 --> 27:41.310
So I took Animal Husbandry and I immediately tried 
to get in the band as a cornet player. So I had the

27:41.982 --> 27:44.705
tryouts there in old Pfeiffer Hall. I got torn down 
years and years ago. I was playing, the bandmaster

27:49.089 --> 27:57.998
was a master sergeant at that time, retired master 
sergeant, big fat guy. He was trying out cornet

27:59.439 --> 28:04.124
players among the freshmen. And I couldn't read 
music even. But I could memorize a tune, so. He had

28:11.041 --> 28:20.093
these freshmen come in and play the same tune, you 
know, and he'd either reject them or keep them. It

28:20.213 --> 28:21.335
finally came my turn. I knew the tune by heart, so I 
went in and rattled it off, and it's cornet, so I was

28:21.535 --> 28:27.363
accepted. You were accepted to the band. Yeah, 
couldn't read the music. That's pretty good. Now,

28:34.552 --> 28:36.795
before you came to A&M, You had, in other words, you 
had no idea whatsoever what you wanted to be, I mean

28:37.045 --> 28:45.896
as far as a profession was concerned? I can't, I 
can't recall any. One time I thought I'd like to be a

28:51.523 --> 28:56.709
doctor, that's about all I remember. So you didn't 
really have any firm goals or anything? I didn't

28:59.472 --> 29:05.179
have anything in mind when I went down there, 
except to get away from Dial Art and get some more

29:05.800 --> 29:10.925
education, that's all.

29:14.408 --> 29:21.616
Okay, so then

29:14.408 --> 29:21.616
you went down there, what year did you go down 
there, was it 1917? 1915. 1915, that's right,

29:23.177 --> 29:24.679
1915.

29:28.242 --> 29:33.327
At this time had you formed, or during your time at 
A&M, had you formed any ideas about politics? I

29:36.254 --> 29:39.838
mean, had you given any thought to political 
parties, or? Well, my dad was, died in the World

29:40.338 --> 29:44.602
Democrat. He lived through the Civil War, and so 
the slaves freed, and the family impoverished,

29:44.622 --> 29:54.931
and he was- You mean your grandfather? No, my 
father. My father was born in 1854. See, he was 12

29:58.134 --> 30:04.360
years old when the Civil War was over. I thought

30:05.538 --> 30:17.995
you said that your grandfather built up in Dodge 
City. Yeah, my grandfather moved from Goliad, or

30:18.415 --> 30:29.250
Floresville I believe at that time, up to Dodge 
City. and took my father and the other children,

30:30.361 --> 30:37.850
you see. Some of the other children.

30:43.877 --> 30:48.802
So your father was a Democrat? Yeah, he always said 
I'd vote. He hated Yankees and he hated

30:54.661 --> 31:02.328
Republicans, and he said, I'd vote for a yellow dog 
on a Democratic ticket before I'd vote for a black

30:54.661 --> 31:02.328
Republican. Well, of course that influenced the 
kids.

31:08.233 --> 31:24.128
Later on, when my older brother was appointed 
governor of Puerto Rico by Republican Hoover, Dad

31:08.233 --> 31:24.128
said, I just can't believe you're a Republican at 
heart.

31:24.952 --> 31:29.899
And what political philosophy do you interpret 
here, too? And now, I'm a Republican. My wife

31:33.565 --> 31:39.734
signed up as a Democrat and I signed up as a 
Republican, but I'm actually an independent. I

31:39.854 --> 31:42.979
vote for the man, I don't vote for the party. Do you 
consider yourself a liberal or a moderate or a

31:42.999 --> 31:47.606
conservative? I consider myself conservative.

31:52.323 --> 31:54.546
I was drawn to Reagan. Reagan and I worked pretty 
hard for Goldwater in 1964. I was on the committee

31:59.934 --> 32:10.630
at Clearwater, Florida working for him. And I 
contributed money to conservative causes until

32:10.670 --> 32:19.343
I'm inundated with letters.

32:21.162 --> 32:39.765
I even get telephone calls from the NCAPAC, 
National Conservative Political Action

32:21.162 --> 32:39.765
Committee, Conservative Caucus, and a dozen 
others, and I've got this big filing cabinet here.

32:39.886 --> 32:49.718
That's where most of it goes, but I have 
contributed several hundred dollars towards

32:39.886 --> 32:49.718
Republicans in the last two years. Okay, now let's 
go back to the A&M. Okay. And the military then, did

32:54.865 --> 33:05.937
that have, the fact that it was a corps 
institution, did that have any impact on you for

32:54.865 --> 33:05.937
going to A&M? No. I had no idea I'd ever be in the 
Army.

33:16.407 --> 33:21.072
When we got in the war, I came home to help Dad on the 
ranch. Before the war, let's talk about what corps

33:21.203 --> 33:25.730
or unit were you in? I was in the band. I lived in 
Pfeiffer Hall. What did you think about, I mean did

33:30.837 --> 33:35.844
you work while you were in them? Did you have any 
opportunity to? Yes, I had to work in order to pay

33:37.567 --> 33:45.719
for my uniforms and food and so forth. I worked as a 
janitor. I was the janitor in Mitchell Hall for I

33:51.055 --> 34:10.404
think about two or three days and then the man in 
charge called me in and put me in charge of the whole

33:51.055 --> 34:10.404
building and I had about six or seven other 
students under me

33:51.055 --> 34:10.404
do the janitorial work on that building. I did 
stenographic work for the secretary of the YMCA

34:23.118 --> 34:29.888
I

34:23.118 --> 34:29.888
can't think of any other work I did. Were you 
employed most of the time when you were there?

34:32.311 --> 34:33.112
Yeah, all the time. Do you remember how much they 
paid you? Do you remember what the wages were back

34:36.938 --> 34:39.942
then? I got two dollars a month first year for 
playing in the band and they raised it to three

34:39.962 --> 34:45.830
dollars. That was fifty percent increase. Three 
dollars a month the second year I was there. The

34:53.662 --> 35:00.429
janitor work seemed to me like I made about $20 a 
month, but I wouldn't swear to that. Working for

35:02.051 --> 35:10.359
the secretary doing his typing and stenographic 
work, I can't remember what I was getting. What did

35:10.379 --> 35:11.860
you think of the accommodations? Oh, that was 
okay. After all, it was the oldest hall there, I

35:17.186 --> 35:22.251
think. Yeah, I had one big shower in the building 
and three of us had a room built for two and things

35:22.923 --> 35:33.913
like that, but it didn't bother us. Were they 
camping out on that? Were they in tents out there on

35:37.036 --> 35:39.718
the drill field? No, none of us were in tents. We 
were all hours in the building. How about the food?

35:49.167 --> 35:52.710
The food was good compared to what I was used to.

35:55.289 --> 36:00.214
I got fat on it.

36:00.234 --> 36:01.155
What core outfit? Oh, you were in the band. Were you 
in another outfit too? No, no. The band, while the

36:07.662 --> 36:16.250
rest were, while the core was drilling, the band 
was practicing music. Did you ever learn to read

36:16.270 --> 36:18.553
music? Not much, no. Still can't.

36:25.276 --> 36:32.386
And make good bandmasters sorry every... What's 
that, lemonade, honey? Yes, it's lemonade. I'll

36:34.048 --> 36:36.552
give you something stronger later on. You're 
talking to who's normally a very quiet man. I

36:42.420 --> 36:44.483
thought I'd better give you something.

36:51.820 --> 36:52.801
I did. I sure enjoyed being in the band because I got 
to travel around with the football team. See

36:58.610 --> 37:04.499
places that I'd heard about from other students, 
but never been around. I'd never been around much

37:04.579 --> 37:08.005
at that time.

37:13.072 --> 37:13.713
I didn't play. I played intramural baseball. I 
wasn't good enough to be on varsity. What about the

37:22.516 --> 37:24.779
hazing? Can you tell me about the hazing? Well, I 
avoided that quite a bit. They didn't pick on me,

37:31.790 --> 37:35.756
maybe because I was little. I just kept my mouth 
shut and tried to be a good fish.

37:47.727 --> 37:56.637
I'd see my roommate one time had his fanny massive 
bruises from being off with a broomstick. I

37:56.717 --> 38:00.822
thought that was awful. Did you think that hazing 
served any purpose? No, none whatever I think of

38:05.066 --> 38:09.351
this.

38:10.533 --> 38:17.160
There's no place there at all, no good purpose that 
I could see.

38:20.971 --> 38:28.040
Some of those kids, well I know one kid that went 
crazy. Tied him to a railroad track. There's a

38:33.646 --> 38:38.332
double track, you see, and the train was coming 
down the main track. They tied him to the railroad?

38:40.615 --> 38:48.244
They blindfolded him, tied him to the track where 
the train was not coming, you see. But he thought

38:48.264 --> 38:50.927
the train was coming around on him. He went nuts. He 
did really? Did they have to send him home? I don't

38:56.626 --> 38:59.609
know what happened to him. But he dropped out of 
A&M? There was quite a stink about it, I know, at

39:03.512 --> 39:14.061
A&M, but he never seemed to be able to stop the 
hazing there.

39:19.946 --> 39:21.707
I thought that was hazing was out of place

39:22.750 --> 39:30.179
in the university. They didn't do it over at Texas 
University where my older brother went. One of my

39:35.966 --> 39:41.213
younger brothers

39:35.966 --> 39:41.213
went. There were four of us going and two of us went 
to A&M and two to Texas. There was no hazing value of

39:46.279 --> 39:48.842
that over in Texas.

39:52.197 --> 39:54.359
Did you like or dislike being in the Corps? I liked 
my two years there. What did you like about being in

39:59.684 --> 40:01.546
the Corps of Cadets? I got good fellowship, made 
some good friends. I got away from that stinging

40:10.814 --> 40:14.618
place, Dalhart. I didn't like Dalhart. I got to see 
a lot of places in Texas I'd never had, never seen,

40:20.902 --> 40:27.890
but had heard about.

40:27.950 --> 40:30.913
Had good food. I had one or two instructors that I 
was very fond of, especially the English

40:32.215 --> 40:39.483
instructor. Okay, who were they? Boy, I couldn't 
call them any now. I just remember that He taught me

40:47.783 --> 40:54.352
how to write a composition.

40:54.372 --> 40:57.957
I learned a lot from him. The mathematics I liked 
until I got into trigonometry.

41:10.153 --> 41:14.719
There's unknown equations in trigonometry that 
remain unknown to me. From then on, I never could

41:16.690 --> 41:21.574
figure out those things, but I could. In the final 
examination, there were 10 questions. You had to

41:24.877 --> 41:26.458
make 70 to pass it. Three of them were unknown 
equations. The three I missed, I made my 70. I got

41:33.644 --> 41:40.750
the other seven right, so I got through all that.

41:44.333 --> 41:46.495
Oh, I liked the...

41:50.626 --> 41:57.857
cutting up the cattle and horses and things like 
that, what do you call it? Animal husbandry? Yeah.

42:02.024 --> 42:03.466
Dissecting? Yeah, dissecting animals. That was 
part of animal husbandry. So you liked the

42:08.414 --> 42:12.200
curriculum in animal husbandry then? Yeah. I 
liked it. I was glad I chose that course because I

42:17.963 --> 42:22.570
don't think I would have been a good engineer.

42:25.454 --> 42:30.622
I don't have a mathematical mind exactly.

42:30.642 --> 42:36.131
Did you dislike anything about being in the Corps? 
Only the hazing.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.422
I liked the drills. I liked the dress parades. I 
liked the Yale practice, going to football games.

42:56.482 --> 42:59.866
The only thing I disliked was hazing. Were you ever 
in any position of leadership when you

42:59.886 --> 43:09.840
were at A&M? made a sergeant in the band for the 
third year, but I didn't go back. I was notified

43:17.162 --> 43:24.489
that I'd been chosen to be sergeant, but I didn't go 
back the third year. I got into the Army. When you

43:28.193 --> 43:40.705
think back on your career and becoming a general, 
what ways do you think that going to A&M helped you,

43:28.193 --> 43:40.705
and what ways do you think it hurt you?

43:44.093 --> 43:46.495
I don't think it had any effect. You don't think A&M 
had any effect? I can't remember thinking of any

43:48.797 --> 43:57.605
effect that my two years at A&M had on it. If I didn't 
drill, I didn't drill enough to know how to get from

43:57.625 --> 44:12.919
here to there, but I went in the aviation section of 
the Signal Corps in the Army and I can't

44:14.772 --> 44:32.456
say that A&M had any effect either way, except it 
taught me how to study, since I had to go to ground

44:14.772 --> 44:32.456
school for eight weeks before I started flying. It

44:33.117 --> 44:38.805
taught me how to study.

44:42.008 --> 44:46.795
taught me to obey orders. Discipline, I think I got 
very good discipline at A&M. The band was

44:54.124 --> 44:57.629
disciplined just the same as the rest of the corps. 
So it seems then that it did have some effect. Yeah.

45:02.356 --> 45:04.459
So now you're saying that it did have some effect. 
Yeah, yeah. It had a good effect in that way. It

45:09.527 --> 45:16.675
taught me discipline and how to study

45:09.527 --> 45:16.675
them. Do you think it had any effect on the fact that 
you became a leader? Yes,

45:21.581 --> 45:33.615
because I watched what the other leaders did at A&M 
and I became well enough like we made a sergeant,

45:35.047 --> 46:00.454
which is about as high as you can get as a junior,

45:35.047 --> 46:00.454
but I've always been a leader among the kids, but 
except at A&M, I can't remember having any

45:35.047 --> 46:00.454
followers there. I had some very fine friends, but 
I can't remember any leadership that I did there.

46:09.280 --> 46:14.987
Were there any professional soldiers at A&M that 
had an effect on you? They taught me discipline.

46:16.309 --> 46:19.793
There was Colonel Muller, M-U-L-L-E-R. 
Lieutenant.

46:28.865 --> 46:30.407
Later became Major General. I can't think of 
anyone. That's my name and some retired sergeants

46:34.160 --> 46:38.185
who worked there. I've

46:38.526 --> 46:52.925
been disciplined ever since I was a kid and my 
parents disciplined me. So I've learned to be a

46:52.945 --> 46:57.932
follower and obey orders. That's what you have to 
learn first before you can be a leader.
