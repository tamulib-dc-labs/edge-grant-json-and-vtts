WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:09.665
pretty much to stay within the field of demography and so, or population kinds of things.

00:10.907 --> 00:21.384
And pretty well, and got, oh by the way, we were part of a national study of farm population trends.

00:21.404 --> 00:29.818
You know, how many people are on farms and what they were doing, that kind of stuff, and how that was declining and all that, so got into that in a big way, and so that led to other things.

00:31.705 --> 00:33.427
Or worked out fine as far as I'm concerned.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.792
You joined the faculty in 1949 and served for how many years?

00:40.393 --> 00:42.595
That's correct.

00:42.615 --> 00:44.597
When did you retire?

00:44.617 --> 00:44.837
1984.

00:46.859 --> 00:47.600
Thirty-five years.

00:48.420 --> 00:49.421
Thirty-five years.

00:53.545 --> 00:53.685
Uh-huh.

00:53.705 --> 00:59.330
General, describe generally the students when you began.

00:59.390 --> 00:59.991
Uh-huh.

01:00.916 --> 01:12.773
And the students in your latter years, how, what, contrast those and compare them?

01:12.793 --> 01:13.994
I would compare them this way.

01:14.034 --> 01:18.080
The big change was the introduction of women.

01:20.263 --> 01:23.127
That was really the big change.

01:24.507 --> 01:32.281
I was one of those, even though I was an OLAG, I was always in favor of women being at A&M.

01:33.784 --> 01:44.743
And I just saw a tremendous, of course I may have been biased by that to some degree, but I was simply very pleased with what really happened.

01:45.162 --> 01:51.732
With the introduction of women, there was just a lot of, it's hard to kind of put your finger on.

01:52.193 --> 02:03.970
I would say this, that the women, I think, brought out more of the good side of the males.

02:05.493 --> 02:11.001
Not only behaviorally, but as students.

02:11.960 --> 02:19.429
I really think that the first group of women we had in, I think, were really committed to saying, we're going to show these guys.

02:19.609 --> 02:20.210
And they did.

02:21.552 --> 02:28.580
And in our department, for example, we had by then established a little awards kind of a thing.

02:29.582 --> 02:33.266
We chose the outstanding student of the year.

02:34.588 --> 02:40.515
And I remember the first three years that the women were here, women won that award each year.

02:40.900 --> 02:46.086
And you know the boys just, I think it just really did wonders for them too.

02:46.346 --> 02:50.791
And I think the girls that we got in here first were really dedicated.

02:50.831 --> 02:52.552
Were they going to show these guys?

02:52.592 --> 02:53.994
They kept us out here for so long.

02:54.815 --> 03:08.089
It just gave the university a boost I think academically, culturally, and just every way that you could put it.

03:09.402 --> 03:20.573
I'd say this, that in the day when I was, for example, an undergraduate, I feel like that, of course I was among the students, the old ags were kind of crude kind of guys.

03:22.055 --> 03:28.561
They would use, you know, not really foul language, you know.

03:29.302 --> 03:34.347
I just saw a big transformation I think, of which I'm really, really pleased with.

03:35.018 --> 03:41.247
In the early 60s, I was part of the Aspirations Committee study and so forth.

03:41.267 --> 03:49.439
Were you involved in some of that effort that led to the recommendations of Co-education and Volunteer Corps and so forth?

03:50.280 --> 03:53.425
No, not really in that sense.

03:54.927 --> 04:00.655
But I do remember something that happened, and that is that

04:01.867 --> 04:10.157
A little bit before then, after Mr. Gabbard retired, Ty Tim was my department head.

04:10.958 --> 04:12.140
Oh yeah, we won't talk about him.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.962
And he was a very, very good person.

04:14.142 --> 04:17.346
He was just great in a sense.

04:17.366 --> 04:20.991
Anyway, and he was pretty close to Mr. Rudder.

04:22.352 --> 04:31.063
And I think Rudder really asked him about, and as I recall, and I don't know if this is exactly right,

04:32.917 --> 04:45.573
Ty was asked if we could do a study, somehow, of students of, how shall I say it, their view of how they viewed Texas A&M as a school.

04:47.315 --> 04:55.965
And Ty, as I recall, asked me to do that.

04:55.985 --> 05:02.113
And I wanted to do it except in the meantime I was tied up with a whole lot of other things with experimentation.

05:02.836 --> 05:08.722
And so we had a guy here by the name of Harold Brown, C. Harold Brown, and Barton Nelson.

05:10.163 --> 05:12.145
And I think they conducted this study.

05:13.426 --> 05:29.822
And as I recall, and this is all secondhand now, they found that typically the East Texas students, we didn't rate worth a darn with them for several reasons, among being all military and all that sort of stuff.

05:29.802 --> 05:41.278
And I really felt, you know, personally that Barton really kind of suffered from that a little bit, that he, some other Mr. Rudder, you know, I don't know, you know, didn't take that very well.

05:42.279 --> 05:45.464
Although it must have impressed him, among other things, of course.

05:45.484 --> 05:47.226
And I've heard other things being said.

05:47.667 --> 05:47.927
Anyway.

05:49.990 --> 05:56.098
Was that, as far as you know, was that study funded by the experiment station?

05:56.118 --> 05:57.380
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:57.420 --> 05:58.562
That was, I think, Mr. Rudder's.

05:58.782 --> 05:59.122
Okay.

05:59.363 --> 05:59.623
No, no.

05:59.603 --> 06:02.327
Harold Brown lived across the street from us at that time.

06:02.347 --> 06:04.229
Oh, he did, yeah, yeah, yeah, C. Harold.

06:04.249 --> 06:21.211
And among the results that I remember, they found a correlation between the students with high grades and a disinterest in going to an all-male or an all-female school.

06:21.331 --> 06:23.014
I think that is correct.

06:23.034 --> 06:27.940
They found that the students thought that A&M had high standards,

06:29.219 --> 06:35.270
But they did not know that A&M offered anything other than agriculture and engineering and veterinary medicine.

06:36.793 --> 06:47.151
And one that I have used many times as a summary, they asked them to generalize, what do you think about Baylor?

06:47.211 --> 06:50.117
What do you think about Texas Tech?

06:50.137 --> 06:53.623
And one of the boys wrote as his summary about A&M.

06:55.814 --> 07:01.283
No girls, no fraternities, no fun, no way.

07:01.844 --> 07:03.748
Yeah, it could be.

07:04.890 --> 07:16.590
So part of our, when we recommended that women be admitted and the Corps be volunteer, one of our arguments was if we are going to be attractive,

07:17.245 --> 07:21.610
To the brightest students, we're going to have to make some modifications.

07:23.553 --> 07:26.837
Now, let's see, those were both your colleagues, weren't they, Barden and?

07:26.857 --> 07:28.739
Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes, you bet.

07:28.759 --> 07:38.551
Matter of fact, I was responsible for Barden coming here because I came here in 49, and Barden and I were grad students at LSU at that time.

07:38.791 --> 07:38.911
Oh.

07:39.572 --> 07:44.738
And so after I was here that first year,

07:45.106 --> 07:48.470
We were given permission, however it was, to add a faculty member.

07:48.950 --> 07:53.556
And again, in those days, we didn't write a bunch of letters and all that, just say, hey, who do you know?

07:54.257 --> 07:58.361
So I recommended Barton, and Barton came here and got the job.

07:59.683 --> 08:07.072
As you began, about how many majors were there in rural sociology?

08:07.092 --> 08:10.415
Do you remember how big they were?

08:10.436 --> 08:11.757
I really don't.

08:11.777 --> 08:13.459
We had a sizable number.

08:13.979 --> 08:17.324
But as I began in those years, I just don't know.

08:18.145 --> 08:18.505
I just don't know.

08:18.525 --> 08:19.747
Well, let's go back to Ty Tim.

08:19.987 --> 08:21.890
Make believe I had never met him.

08:21.930 --> 08:22.671
Describe him.

08:24.554 --> 08:30.422
Ty was a very, I think, able department head.

08:31.243 --> 08:35.148
One of the most able that I've been around among that group anyway.

08:37.071 --> 08:38.012
Interesting enough,

08:39.207 --> 08:47.477
When Mr. Gabbard was going to retire, see I was a member of that department at that time, and I was very close with the ag economists.

08:49.319 --> 08:56.547
And the ag economists did not want to have Ty as the department head because Ty was an extension person.

08:57.849 --> 09:03.135
And you know, they thought this guy is not a researcher, all that kind of stuff, and so we don't want him.

09:03.155 --> 09:04.196
But anyway, he got the job.

09:04.316 --> 09:04.557
Anyway.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.421
And Ty, I think, was a very, very good administrator.

09:08.722 --> 09:20.220
And they sort of I think felt, Ty was, his degree was a DPA, I believe it was Doctor of Public Administration, something like that.

09:20.480 --> 09:26.089
They felt like that was sort of below the level of what they wanted anyway.

09:27.571 --> 09:31.035
in a very short time, I think, convinced people he was really, he had it.

09:31.635 --> 09:32.096
And he did.

09:32.136 --> 09:35.860
He was excellent politically and otherwise.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.782
He was just very, very good.

09:37.982 --> 09:38.743
That's all I can say.

09:38.763 --> 09:42.767
And he was very, always prepared.

09:42.807 --> 09:51.857
And he made, since we had the two disciplines, he, as

09:53.204 --> 10:04.954
When Professor Russell got to be older, he said, okay, you know, Dr. Dan, you finish out your years, but Bob's going to be the chairman of that group now.

10:06.137 --> 10:08.884
And so I used to go to him, with him.

10:10.349 --> 10:14.475
meetings with the dean of agriculture and people like that.

10:15.456 --> 10:17.039
And he was always prepared.

10:17.079 --> 10:34.163
He always had a plan A, a plan B, and he just, the minute we would walk in, the two of us, to discuss something dealing with, let's say, the rural society part of it, or maybe the department, he was the kind of guy who could just spot how the director or whoever it was felt that day.

10:34.868 --> 10:42.735
Now, he's always struck me from a distance, way over in the history department, as one of the most potent department heads in agriculture.

10:42.915 --> 10:43.536
Yeah, I think so.

10:44.237 --> 10:50.463
Anyway, and he always had plant A and plant A. So we walk in and the dean wasn't feeling just right that day or something.

10:50.943 --> 10:54.206
He would immediately go, you know, he'd jump that and he'd go the southern direction.

10:54.486 --> 10:55.487
But yes, he was.

10:56.268 --> 11:01.753
I also felt that, honestly, that many of the department heads in agriculture

11:03.286 --> 11:06.242
He wasn't the most popular with them.

11:07.808 --> 11:10.392
partly because again he didn't have a Ph.D.

11:10.412 --> 11:12.094
you know, he was one of these other guys.

11:13.496 --> 11:21.146
And I think partly because he was gaining so much favor with the deans and whoever ran the College of Agriculture at that time.

11:22.989 --> 11:34.084
And I think they saw him as kind of a slick politician type rather than a guy who keeps the reins on the department members and stuff like that.

11:34.164 --> 11:35.706
But Ty was very, very good.

11:36.310 --> 11:43.237
From your point of view, who were the other key department heads in the College of Agriculture?

11:45.419 --> 11:46.080
At that time?

11:46.921 --> 11:49.443
Mm-hmm.

11:49.804 --> 11:51.886
John Quisenberry, poultry science.

11:53.187 --> 11:56.530
He was rather influential.

12:01.495 --> 12:05.119
What about that animal science fellow from Orange named Butler?

12:07.799 --> 12:10.082
I don't know, at that time he wasn't there.

12:10.342 --> 12:10.642
Oh, O.D.

12:10.662 --> 12:11.704
wasn't there?

12:11.744 --> 12:13.185
But I don't think he was there at that point.

12:13.205 --> 12:13.666
Oh, okay.

12:13.686 --> 12:14.267
He came later.

12:15.047 --> 12:15.989
I believe D.W.

12:16.009 --> 12:18.271
Williams was the head of department.

12:18.992 --> 12:19.252
Okay.

12:19.332 --> 12:21.655
Which I didn't know too much about.

12:23.097 --> 12:26.481
All right, move on forward then into the 60s and 70s.

12:27.202 --> 12:36.152
Who were the... Well, one of them was Wayne Hall.

12:37.516 --> 12:39.879
I think he was department head.

12:39.899 --> 12:46.288
And he was, I think, very, very good, very good administrator, well liked all that sort of stuff.

12:46.308 --> 12:49.573
He later became dean of the graduate college.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.241
I'm sure O.D.

12:55.261 --> 12:58.205
was one of those who had a lot of influence.

12:58.225 --> 13:01.610
All right, let's move to the 60s with Mr. Rudder here.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.633
Did you ever work with Mr. Rudder?

13:04.815 --> 13:06.477
Did you form an opinion of him?

13:08.988 --> 13:11.111
I'm going to say, let me go back before then.

13:12.894 --> 13:32.903
When he got appointed I was one of those who felt like, no, this guy is a military man, he has nothing, sure he's a good administrator at the level that he was at, but he's just not going to be on the campus to do that job.

13:34.334 --> 13:36.257
Maybe Ty had something to do with it, I don't know.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.220
But they were, he and Ty were very good friends.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.763
They may have been classmates, I'm not sure.

13:40.965 --> 13:46.053
But he wasn't here very long before it began to change my opinion.

13:46.433 --> 13:51.782
And I thought just a lot of him.

13:52.343 --> 13:56.930
And as the years progressed, my evaluation went up and up.

13:57.992 --> 14:01.337
And particularly when he brought the women in.

14:02.566 --> 14:06.431
You know, there was just a little icing on the cake.

14:08.133 --> 14:17.264
You've seen the 20-minute tape that they have on the history of College Station, okay.

14:17.284 --> 14:18.466
If you remember, Ms.

14:18.486 --> 14:23.292
Rudder makes a comment about the football and that kind of thing, how that fit in.

14:23.332 --> 14:23.713
Anyway, yeah.

14:23.793 --> 14:27.257
But anyway, no, I really thought it was quite good.

14:27.440 --> 14:37.302
Like I offer over and over in speeches the idea that only Earl Rudder could have politically made those changes.

14:37.322 --> 14:37.963
I believe that's right.

14:38.444 --> 14:44.858
Because Dr. Morgan, I believe it was, had some of the same ideas, but he didn't survive.

14:44.878 --> 14:45.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:46.222 --> 14:59.355
During those years, as you continued your work, as you look back now on those 35 years on the faculty, what are you most proud of personally?

14:59.395 --> 15:01.237
What are your proudest accomplishments?

15:03.459 --> 15:05.241
Well, you're talking about for me personally?

15:06.982 --> 15:15.891
Well, I guess the thing I'm most proud of is that I was in the very first group that received the

15:16.732 --> 15:20.216
Distinguished Teaching Awards, that group.

15:20.756 --> 15:21.758
That's probably the highlight.

15:21.778 --> 15:22.398
The first year?

15:22.819 --> 15:23.499
The very first year.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.240
That's marvelous.

15:24.461 --> 15:27.704
There was Wayne Hall and somebody else was in that group, I forget.

15:29.206 --> 15:39.537
And then the second thing was that in 82, I guess it was, I got the same award for research.

15:42.440 --> 15:46.705
Also been very proud of the fact that

15:48.457 --> 15:53.468
I still have a pretty good close relationship with a number of former students.

15:54.369 --> 16:00.442
You know, not totally, as I get older that changed, but that's another thing I'm very proud of.

16:00.502 --> 16:08.018
And I'm proud of the kids that I had in class that I knew fairly well, how well they have done.

16:09.230 --> 16:13.415
I have only very happy thoughts about the whole thing.

16:13.495 --> 16:16.939
It has just been marvelous from beginning to end.

16:18.100 --> 16:33.297
And I'm proud of the fact that I had the freedom to, well I don't know, somewhere along the line it seemed to me I was pretty much given free reign to say go ahead and do what you want to do, more or less.

16:33.968 --> 16:41.215
And that the administrators, whoever they might have been, whether it was Maxwell or whoever it was, got encouraged from everybody.

16:41.275 --> 16:49.343
And this is kind of bragging, I guess, but I have over 200 publications that I'm very, very proud of.

16:49.423 --> 16:53.227
And they're in all kinds of popular magazines and so forth.

16:53.247 --> 16:57.271
And they're in some of the better known academic things.

16:58.072 --> 17:00.955
Of which of those publications are you most proud?

17:02.588 --> 17:16.390
Well, if you want to talk about the one I like the best, it's the one that I did, I'm not, you know, the one I like the best that I've done was the one that I did in American Demographics.

17:17.551 --> 17:29.490
It was written in, I'm not sure what year now, but it was about the time that, what's her name, was running for, was going to be the vice presidential candidate, Lady.

17:30.247 --> 17:35.315
You know, I'm talking about the United States.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.576
The Kansas Senators.

17:37.137 --> 17:39.140
Yeah, yeah, anyway.

17:39.160 --> 17:39.541
Anyway, yeah.

17:40.362 --> 17:47.833
I wrote it very well accepted and it just got really international press from the fact that

17:47.813 --> 17:54.764
I was saying at that time, of course it's written from a particular viewpoint, saying hey, better watch out for these women.

17:55.124 --> 17:58.309
They're going to gain power and so forth and so forth.

17:58.409 --> 18:12.150
And it's kind of, it's really a very cute piece about the gaining power, political power of women eventually, and how it has progressed and

18:12.451 --> 18:18.058
and with supporting data about that kind of stuff and why this is so and all that kind of stuff.

18:18.078 --> 18:21.221
I guess that's one of our most popular, it's by far the most popular.

18:21.582 --> 18:28.209
All right, now I know of your, some of your fine work about the Czech population in Texas.

18:29.070 --> 18:41.665
Did they always respect what you were doing or did some of them want to be restrictive about sharing their information with you?

18:42.978 --> 18:45.101
No, they were very open, very open, always.

18:46.443 --> 18:47.885
They were good and proud of?

18:47.905 --> 19:01.625
Oh yes, yes, I have no, now let me say, it could be that after I left talking to somebody they probably said, you know, that old boy, you know, but I know I really had a tremendously fine relationship with them.

19:01.645 --> 19:03.307
I never heard anything but positive.

19:03.467 --> 19:08.254
They have just been great, and life has just been so good it just couldn't be any better.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.858
And Texas A&M has got a lot to do with it.

19:11.513 --> 19:19.625
And I think that Czech background got a lot to do with just, and I would say this, that nothing was ever planned.

19:20.245 --> 19:30.860
It just unfolded, and particular points in my life of just certain decisions were made for some, whatever reason, I don't know, but it just turned out fine.

19:30.880 --> 19:31.101
Right.

19:31.722 --> 19:36.188
Over these 35, now 45 or so years,

19:36.843 --> 19:44.314
What key decisions did A&M make that now look to be good?

19:44.614 --> 19:45.776
One was the admission of women.

19:46.036 --> 19:53.146
What are some other key decisions that you can think of made in agriculture and or in general about A&M?

19:53.426 --> 19:54.548
What were the big steps?

19:54.865 --> 20:07.086
The big steps for me I think were again, you mentioned the women, but I think become a Sea Grant, become a

20:09.479 --> 20:12.623
Well, we were at a land grant.

20:13.224 --> 20:14.046
What's the third one?

20:14.066 --> 20:16.129
You know, that part of it.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.113
Those are really the big steps, I think.

20:20.174 --> 20:23.479
And I'm just as proud as I can be of things that have happened.

20:23.499 --> 20:25.542
Can you think of any mistakes that we made?

20:25.582 --> 20:33.293
Not really.

20:34.724 --> 20:44.116
I don't know if we call them mistakes, but among the people that I've served under, I just regarded Jack Williams as the tops.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.046
And if you want to talk about a mistake,

20:48.511 --> 20:59.822
I felt like that, and I don't know anything about the circumstances, after all, I'm not in the inner circle, but I just really felt like that Jack kind of got not too good a treatment.

21:00.482 --> 21:05.687
If you'd call that a mistake, I don't know, but I just thought he was just terrific, just terrific, just terrific.

21:05.827 --> 21:07.329
I agree with you on both points.

21:09.671 --> 21:12.674
Why do you feel so positive about him?

21:12.754 --> 21:17.218
What do you think were his skills and talents?

21:17.958 --> 21:25.730
I think in point of time if I'd track and say what's happened that really did, made A&M great, and I do think it's great, I really do.

21:26.992 --> 21:28.013
And I know it's great.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.699
Earl Rudder brought it to a certain level.

21:33.281 --> 21:40.472
I may be wrong, but my evaluation of Rudder is I really feel like he may have taken it about as far as he could have, maybe not.

21:41.802 --> 21:46.046
But Jack was the big thing that really hit here, that really did it.

21:47.147 --> 22:02.942
And he just had such leadership skills and of course I'm just a little guy on the sideline, tuned in as little as I could by talking to people who might know something, might not, they might even be giving me false information.

22:03.683 --> 22:07.607
I just had the impression that he was the guy that really made this place.

22:08.397 --> 22:10.446
really what it is today.

22:10.928 --> 22:17.496
I mean there have been people who succeeded him and they've done great things but he's been the guy.

22:17.712 --> 22:18.934
I think those were the two.

22:19.856 --> 22:24.145
And my theme is only they could have done what they did.

22:24.205 --> 22:26.930
If you reverse them, neither one of them succeeds.

22:27.411 --> 22:27.852
Probably not.

22:28.072 --> 22:34.665
Because Williams would have had political trouble with co-education because he wasn't a Texan and all that.

22:34.685 --> 22:38.573
Mr. Rutter would have had academic trouble trying to do what Williams did.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.865
So God or somebody was kind to us.

22:43.147 --> 22:43.687
They sure were.

22:46.711 --> 22:53.200
Down in agriculture at the college level, who would you give key credit to?

22:58.006 --> 23:01.330
I'd have to think about, well, one I would have to give key credit to is R.D.

23:01.370 --> 23:02.011
Lewis.

23:02.031 --> 23:04.134
He was the director of the experiment station.

23:05.055 --> 23:06.417
And I think he...

23:06.903 --> 23:08.827
even though he wasn't the dean.

23:08.887 --> 23:16.343
Another one I would give credit to, although I don't know just how much influence he had, was Gus Watkins.

23:18.287 --> 23:26.785
He was really good in his day for what he was, but I never did understand the

23:27.676 --> 23:30.579
division of power among those in agriculture.

23:30.659 --> 23:37.007
Another guy that I give great credit to was John Hutchison, Director of the Extension Service.

23:40.431 --> 23:48.540
Individually I guess those would be probably the big names, to me I guess, but R.D.

23:48.580 --> 23:50.562
Lewis and John Hutchison and

23:52.820 --> 23:55.322
Gus Watkins, I guess.

23:55.462 --> 24:00.026
If I thought about that long and hard, I might come up with something different.

24:00.647 --> 24:13.459
In rural sociology, we were, correct me if I'm wrong, when you joined the department, we were an average program, I presume.

24:15.460 --> 24:16.401
Maybe below average.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.065
How good did we become?

24:21.186 --> 24:22.827
How competitive did we become?

24:25.169 --> 24:38.837
Well that's kind of difficult to, you have to kind of separate these things out a little bit because we became, right now, in my opinion, we are quite good.

24:38.997 --> 24:45.270
We're among the, you know, the top, I don't know, maybe 20 or 30 or something like that, yes.

24:46.752 --> 25:03.715
And now by measuring that, however, I would have to measure that basically by the quality of the faculty, which is really measured by how big a research grant and how big a name they have.

25:04.505 --> 25:06.507
And we have some really big names here.

25:06.587 --> 25:09.310
I mean, they're really something, some of these people.

25:09.330 --> 25:15.477
We have about three or four, I guess, that really are somebodies in the sociological world, whatever that means.

25:15.658 --> 25:17.500
They're just idiots out there.

25:17.800 --> 25:25.249
And also I might say that I've been retired for so long, I don't really know what's going on in the world in the sociology field.

25:26.950 --> 25:29.213
But I think that I would put it this way.

25:29.800 --> 25:43.336
The big step, really, some of the big steps that came along was when we finally got the change from the College of Agriculture to the liberal arts.

25:43.376 --> 25:46.100
I think that was the big step again.

25:46.901 --> 25:51.727
And the fact that simultaneously at that time they permitted us to offer the Ph.D.

25:51.927 --> 25:53.168
degree and that kind of thing.

25:53.689 --> 25:57.934
Who deserves particular credit for that Ph.D., do you know?

25:59.213 --> 26:03.140
I think I do, and I guess I'm at liberty to kind of say.

26:08.650 --> 26:13.058
Several people, one of them was Wayne Hall.

26:13.078 --> 26:19.129
He was dean of the graduate college, but he, you know, I'll go back and say this.

26:20.510 --> 26:24.499
I lost some friends in agriculture who were my big, big buddies.

26:24.780 --> 26:33.140
But I think once we got transferred over there, those guys lost me as a friend.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.924
I mean I lost them as a friend.

26:35.815 --> 26:41.605
And they're very, they guard their own territory very, very well.

26:41.705 --> 26:47.695
And that's one of my, I'd say, feelings about agriculture.

26:47.735 --> 26:51.661
They're a very closely knit group and always have been in Extension Service.

26:52.002 --> 26:59.815
But anyway, there were certain key people, I'm trying to think of the

27:02.360 --> 27:08.028
gentleman's name that was the, I guess he had the title of provost, although that name probably wasn't at that time.

27:08.048 --> 27:08.668
What was his name?

27:09.690 --> 27:13.355
Same time that Hall was in the graduate college, this guy was.

27:14.456 --> 27:20.023
All right, now, when I went to work for Hall, he had, in the late 60s, he had both titles.

27:20.925 --> 27:25.330
He was vice president of academic affairs and dean of the graduate school.

27:25.351 --> 27:28.755
Well, he had a lot to do with it, but the guy that followed him,

27:28.955 --> 27:31.079
And Horace Byers?

27:31.139 --> 27:32.883
That's it, that's it, that's it.

27:32.903 --> 27:36.970
He was, he was, he was, I just, my head is off to him.

27:38.113 --> 27:42.441
Because he really, really did, I think, wonders for us.

27:42.455 --> 27:45.478
And then Calhoun followed him as the vice president.

27:45.898 --> 27:51.563
Well, I didn't know Calhoun that well, but, you know, there were little bitty battle lines drawn, you know.

27:51.943 --> 27:59.689
And I remember that, well, people in College of Agriculture were very, very unhappy with us moving out.

27:59.990 --> 28:00.530
Very unhappy.

28:00.630 --> 28:01.671
Y'all had sold out.

28:02.051 --> 28:02.932
Yeah, that's right.

28:03.312 --> 28:06.815
And I remember some little things that took place.

28:07.316 --> 28:12.360
For example, when it came to the question of

28:13.825 --> 28:15.796
whether or not we should have a PhD program.

28:16.661 --> 28:21.388
We were still in the College of Agriculture.

28:22.938 --> 28:29.747
Dr. Barris asked me to go with him to appear before the coordinating board to try to make our case.

28:31.470 --> 28:46.971
And at that time the dean of agriculture, as I recall, I'm not sure if it was straight, pretty well let me know that I was overstepping my bounds, that somebody else should do that.

28:46.951 --> 28:56.706
And I also got the, well anyway, Dr. Byers, in effect, I think he really kind of stepped in and said, hey, you know, I'm running this shop and you're the one that's going to go.

28:57.066 --> 29:03.115
So, and that was, you know, but I respect Byers for that.

29:03.175 --> 29:10.727
He really, anyway, really, right, but the two big guys I think were Hall and then Byers.

29:11.268 --> 29:16.215
Now when you all moved over to liberal arts, were you fairly treated?

29:17.056 --> 29:18.117
Oh yes, very good.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.940
And Maxwell was the dean then?

29:20.960 --> 29:21.401
That's correct.

29:21.521 --> 29:27.508
I was appointed the, not the department head, but the acting head.

29:27.528 --> 29:29.830
And Maxwell treated us very, very well.

29:29.971 --> 29:41.043
Now one other thing that happened, however, simultaneously, there were just one or two courses in anthropology taught by different units, professors on their own.

29:42.204 --> 29:44.447
And when we made this change,

29:44.714 --> 29:49.439
whoever the powers that be, said there will be a Department of Sociology and Anthropology.

29:50.820 --> 30:03.072
And having sort of been under the thumb of ag-economics, and I take nothing away from Ty now, I'm just saying, we were the second-class citizens in India.

30:03.092 --> 30:06.415
And I just felt like that we didn't want that.

30:07.876 --> 30:13.742
So when we got over there, one of the first things I did, I got to Kevin Maxwell, I said,

30:15.848 --> 30:18.392
We want to do everything we can for anthropology.

30:18.573 --> 30:19.614
I'm in sociology.

30:19.694 --> 30:21.057
I've been in other situations.

30:22.699 --> 30:28.209
I would like us to find somebody who can really run the anthropology part of the program.

30:29.230 --> 30:30.513
And boy, was I fortunate.

30:31.634 --> 30:32.877
We find Vaughn Bryant.

30:33.598 --> 30:36.883
And I'm telling you, that guy, he is something.

30:37.364 --> 30:38.266
How did you find him?

30:39.087 --> 30:40.169
How did you locate him?

30:40.269 --> 30:42.092
It was an interesting kind of a thing.

30:43.979 --> 30:47.283
I had kind of felt around here and there.

30:47.303 --> 30:50.948
SMU had a good program in anthropology.

30:51.068 --> 30:52.891
The University of Texas had a good program.

30:52.911 --> 30:54.272
And I sort of talked to some of those guys.

30:54.333 --> 30:58.358
Anyway, he was at Washington State I do believe at the time.

30:59.760 --> 31:05.447
And his name kind of surfaced and I've got a, I've got a.
