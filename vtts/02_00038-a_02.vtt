WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:07.839
member of the chow hall slam? Oh, gosh. Bread, 
butter, milk, gravy, beans?

00:16.888 --> 00:18.029
Let me think a little bit. It's been a long time that 
I don't remember that. Do I remember any of those

00:21.752 --> 00:24.055
things? I'll have to deal one if you want a piece of 
bread. Milk?

00:32.903 --> 00:36.587
It was cow.

00:40.551 --> 00:41.131
Meat. Meat. I'm sorry. Bull neck. Bull neck. Bull 
neck. All right. See, you know all of these things.

00:48.659 --> 00:50.081
I don't remember. Did you ever, when you were home, 
did you ever forget and say some of the things? You

00:59.370 --> 01:00.832
want some shit on the shingle? Yeah. Yeah. And what 
was the reaction of your family?

01:07.184 --> 01:14.113
Again, by that time my father was dead and only my 
mother, and she was not one to be shocked. It did not

01:15.175 --> 01:16.937
bother her. Am I not correct that that was not an 
uncommon thing for an Aggie to forget? Not

01:21.623 --> 01:23.365
uncommon at all, no, no. It would be very common. 
No, it would be quite common. And in my particular

01:28.916 --> 01:33.701
case, it would not have come as a shock at all. All 
right. Now let's talk about academics.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.871
You ended up majoring in? Industrial 
engineering. Industrial engineering. Help

01:47.596 --> 01:54.683
please try to recall key faculty, counselors, 
advisors, et cetera. Who were the people that made

01:55.118 --> 01:58.684
a difference for you? The head of the... I started 
out in a... When I went into the course, it was

02:03.231 --> 02:11.204
called Management Engineering, and its name 
changed to Industrial. And Arch Burgess was the

02:12.246 --> 02:18.436
head of the department, and he was a... I... I can't 
describe how wonderful a department head he could

02:21.342 --> 02:29.415
be because he would work for his students. He would 
do anything. He would come. He would work nights

02:32.099 --> 02:34.643
with you on projects. He would come in and help you 
individually.

02:40.373 --> 02:41.815
When I was a senior, I had to, I again went to him and I 
said, I have to have a course, and I don't even

02:42.638 --> 02:54.573
remember what course it was, in order to graduate. 
And it is not offered in this semester, which means

02:54.593 --> 03:02.343
I will have to go another entire year. And he went to 
the, I guess, academic council, and he agreed. He

03:07.449 --> 03:11.835
said, all right, I have gotten them to authorize 
the course for you. I will meet with you, and we will

03:12.322 --> 03:16.866
discuss it. And if you need any help, you call me for 
an appointment, and we will discuss it. I will give

03:23.052 --> 03:25.574
you a mid-semester quiz. I'll give you a project 
and an end-of-semester quiz. And I ended up

03:30.539 --> 03:33.282
getting a B in the course. I was the only enrollee. I 
think that would be difficult today. There are

03:37.846 --> 03:39.207
just too many students. But he would do that. He did 
it not only for me, he did it for other people that

03:41.124 --> 03:45.890
had the same kind of problem. Others, add to that. 
Oh. God, I

03:48.433 --> 03:54.961
can see the man's face, but I can't remember his 
name. He taught us statistics. He was an older man.

04:00.588 --> 04:03.252
And he taught us statistics. And he... He really, I 
guess, taught us to think. What in the world is a

04:07.495 --> 04:09.517
man's name? I can see his face. I'll think of it in a 
minute. He taught us statistics. But while

04:17.146 --> 04:25.535
teaching us, he taught us statistics, but he 
taught us how to think. What

04:27.658 --> 04:31.842
is his name? Captain, Captain, Captain.

04:37.237 --> 04:39.980
He was addressed by his military title. Well, 
let's go on. Other, chemistry, physics, math,

04:43.904 --> 04:47.628
English? English. A man by the name of Creswell who 
taught us literature and really, again, took some

04:49.650 --> 05:01.303
not very couth kids from Waco and taught him to 
enjoy literature so that still today at any one

05:01.621 --> 05:14.453
time I'm reading two books at least and maybe three 
at any one time. But he taught us to appreciate and

05:14.473 --> 05:22.500
enjoy reading.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.865
I don't remember anything outstanding in math. 
Chemistry, I enjoyed it every time I took it. I had

05:31.000 --> 05:34.003
difficulty with chemistry. Do you

05:34.043 --> 05:38.988
remember any of the instructions? No. Sorry. But I 
just could not, chemistry never made sense to me

05:39.228 --> 05:51.941
and I think it took me three semesters to get a D. And 
I was so pleased with the D that it went home. It was

05:51.961 --> 05:59.168
one of the mysteries of life.

06:00.312 --> 06:08.020
over in a mechanical drawing slash et cetera shop. 
We had to take shop as engineering in those days.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.106
You had to be able to run a lathe. You had to work in a 
foundry. Engineers, I don't think, do that

06:15.829 --> 06:17.691
anymore. They simulate it, perhaps, on a computer 
screen. But we had to go do it hands-on. And we

06:25.840 --> 06:29.003
always called the guys slide rule. I can't 
remember the slide rule. Can you remember any of

06:33.496 --> 06:41.267
the other faculty nicknames?

06:41.307 --> 06:41.467
Sorry? Cube Root Kent, Square Root Jackson. 
Square Root Jackson is bigger than math. That's

06:49.519 --> 06:51.001
something I've heard. Supposedly, the number of 
students that have passed the course was the

06:51.061 --> 06:58.070
square root of . Did you have any history? Oh, yes, 
we had to take history, but again, nothing. In

07:02.413 --> 07:08.158
those days, engineering, you took history 
courses because you had to take history courses.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.439
You don't remember who you were. No. I had an 
elective in senior year, and I took a salesmanship

07:10.360 --> 07:20.008
course from a man by the name of Thompson.

07:25.694 --> 07:29.517
And I took public speaking, which is one that 
Something that I enjoyed. I felt it was something

07:31.277 --> 07:33.019
that I need. The other thing that I took, and his 
name was Spriggs.

07:39.887 --> 07:41.609
That comes trippingly from the tongue. I hope it's 
accurate. But he taught public speaking, and I

07:43.672 --> 07:48.618
wanted that course. These were electives in the 
engineering courses. What were the unwritten

07:52.763 --> 07:59.031
rules about class attendance and behavior? for 
you and your buddies? Well, not to attend class and

08:02.440 --> 08:19.633
not to have a good excuse was a zero value for the day 
and anything that was homework that was late

08:02.440 --> 08:19.633
didn't matter. If it was due on the day you didn't 
attend, You got a zero. You might attend and not

08:23.864 --> 08:28.791
have it done and get a dispensation to turn it in 
later. But if you didn't come to class, it didn't

08:28.811 --> 08:35.100
matter.

08:36.703 --> 08:48.981
You always addressed the instructor by the title, 
whether they were Mr. or Professor or Doctor.

08:50.108 --> 08:53.071
you addressed always by title with a question. It 
was formal, formal in those days. And that's just

08:59.538 --> 09:01.520
the way it was done. A teaching assistant, which 
you would see as a lab assistant in laboratories,

09:01.540 --> 09:11.251
could be addressed by a first name. He's a doctoral 
candidate or a master candidate. As you recall,

09:14.425 --> 09:19.933
were the faculty members accessible to you? Yes. 
Yes. Anytime. Anytime. At home, office, on the

09:23.358 --> 09:25.341
campus. Yes, they were. They did a tremendous 
amount of one-on-one. Yes. Do you have any idea

09:32.232 --> 09:37.800
what it cost for you to go for a year or semester? I 
have one thing that I've always enjoyed, and it's a

09:38.675 --> 09:46.301
story I've told so many times, and yes, I remember 
it. When I enrolled as a freshman, you had to have

09:46.322 --> 09:58.092
$200, a diploma from an accredited high school, 
and be free of communicable disease. That was the

09:58.752 --> 10:01.374
only requirement, but you had to have $200. And 
that paid for a semester? I guess it paid for a

10:02.976 --> 10:04.877
semester. In your case, did you ever have an 
on-campus job? Yes. Where? I worked for... I spent

10:13.273 --> 10:17.058
most of my time working in the College of 
Agriculture. The most memorable job being they

10:17.118 --> 10:24.187
were developing, spraying from aircraft. And 
back over across the river in one of the fields, we

10:25.508 --> 10:33.859
would take eight and a half by eleven pieces of 
paper. put them on little platforms across a field

10:34.413 --> 10:45.527
for maybe 200 yards and the aircraft would come in 
and would pass and spray back and forth. Then you

10:45.927 --> 10:59.163
gather up all the pieces of paper where they were 
located and you took them in and you put them on a

10:45.927 --> 10:59.163
grid and then you counted the spots in the grid and 
you had to decide what was a big spot and what was a

10:45.927 --> 10:59.163
little spot. And it was the decisions that killed 
me with the job. But it was a good job and it paid

11:03.539 --> 11:08.066
well. I don't remember how much it was, but it was a 
good paying job for that time. It was a good paying

11:14.035 --> 11:16.439
job. I worked for them for three years. As far as you 
can recall, about how much spending money did you

11:22.929 --> 11:31.082
have to spend casually? Oh, no more than five 
dollars a week, if that much. No more than that.

11:39.794 --> 11:44.059
What would you spend on casual food? Junk food, 
entertainment. Where did you get that? Well, they

11:48.102 --> 11:54.388
had drink machines were there and so forth. 
Vending apparatus were there. both on campus and

11:59.935 --> 12:02.319
at the Air Force Base. And then at Northgate, there 
were always places to spend your money. And it

12:08.270 --> 12:12.517
didn't go to grind very much. You could do anything 
you wanted to do at Northgate. The YMCA was there.

12:18.408 --> 12:18.728
Oh, yes. What would it do? What was that for? Why? I 
was never active in the YMCA, but they generally

12:22.058 --> 12:37.241
did, you know, to the best of my knowledge, if you 
had a problem or trouble, you would go to the Y, and

12:22.058 --> 12:37.241
they would find ways to help you, but I'm sorry. Was 
Mr. Cashin still?

12:41.267 --> 12:41.908
I don't know. No, Ray Cashin. Yeah, Ray Cashin. MSC 
opened? I think in the spring of my sophomore year,

12:46.915 --> 13:01.314
I

12:46.915 --> 13:01.314
went in the fall of 48, spring of 49. I don't 
remember whether it was spring of 49 or the spring

13:01.874 --> 13:07.582
of 50 that it opened. And it was wonderful with 
Bowling Alley and all of that.

13:16.463 --> 13:23.572
It was something badly needed by the university 
and something that needs to be about 10 times its

13:16.463 --> 13:23.572
size today. You have to understand that the

13:24.573 --> 13:34.746
basic building is unchanged from then. You have 
40,000 students trying to get into that building.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.336
We had five. What did the MSC mean in motion in 10X? 
Did the word memorial, was that an important part

13:46.208 --> 13:51.055
of it? The Memorial Student Center, yes. It was 
important that it was a memorial because we were

13:54.119 --> 14:00.767
much closer to a major war than they are today. We 
were much closer to the war that generated it.

14:07.898 --> 14:12.782
There were even people who were students who were 
over there and had been shot in that war. And then

14:13.543 --> 14:18.727
there were we younger people who had relatives 
that had died in that war. And so the memorial park

14:19.448 --> 14:25.293
was more important to us than I'm sure it is today. 
You and I are almost exactly the same age. These old

14:29.936 --> 14:33.740
veterans from World War II. You're talking about 
my brother. They were living where? Where did the

14:38.206 --> 14:41.269
vets live? They lived in the older dorms, Law, 
Currier, the dorms, some that are gone now. Then

14:53.381 --> 14:56.824
the married ones, where did they live? The married 
ones lived down there on the south corner in the

14:56.844 --> 15:04.872
projects, and then across up the... What do they 
call it up there behind what used to be the Ramada?

15:14.245 --> 15:16.428
They were up in there. There were two areas for 
married students. What did you youngsters think

15:20.034 --> 15:25.703
about the veterans as fellow students? They were 
just students. Didn't think anything about them

15:27.366 --> 15:29.950
one way or the other. They were just students. It 
was fine. Did they work hard? Were they... They

15:33.725 --> 15:36.769
were a challenge to us. They were more dedicated. 
We were

15:39.593 --> 15:46.363
still teenagers. We were 18 and 19. And they were in 
their upper ends of their 20s and usually in a hurry

15:48.686 --> 15:55.656
to get on with their lives. And we weren't. As far as 
you can recall, what did their lives do? I wasn't. I

16:03.654 --> 16:04.575
have no idea. At 18, I probably didn't care. I was 
assuming that many of them worked on campus at

16:07.939 --> 16:12.083
various places. Oh, I'm sure they were the 
secretaries and so forth on campus. I feel

16:16.287 --> 16:17.529
confident of that. Did the MSC have a lot of 
activities early in its existence? Yes. Upstairs

16:28.180 --> 16:29.922
in the I don't know what they call it now. It was an 
auditorium at that time. It had a stage and a

16:33.741 --> 16:35.584
ballroom. But it had a stage and all of that. And 
yes, they brought in the big bands of the day. They

16:45.339 --> 16:46.801
played on that stage. I

16:47.021 --> 16:52.690
can't remember any of the big bands. But they were 
all well known. And they came in. You could dance

16:58.015 --> 17:00.599
there and on out. It opened on to the roof of the 
building next to Terry's. So you could handle

17:04.345 --> 17:09.272
several hundred up there at any one time. Yes, it 
was the university, I think, worked hard to keep

17:09.332 --> 17:19.708
things going in that building. And I think they did 
a very good job. Were you aware of Wayne Stark then?

17:25.557 --> 17:26.959
Wayne Stark was there. You know, for me, he and I did 
not, we did not have any interaction at all. What

17:34.532 --> 17:36.454
happened at Guy and Hall? Well, that was movie 
theater. Yes, there were movies there. Guy, of

17:40.760 --> 17:42.122
course, is gone. He's across the street from the 
park. How often were there movies? All the time.

17:47.409 --> 17:47.930
Every day. Every day. It was just a running movie 
theater. Did y'all go much? Oh, yes. Because you

17:52.336 --> 17:53.638
could go for... nickels and dimes i don't remember 
the price but it was no cost and the movies changed

17:54.412 --> 18:22.832
twice a week and normally the audience was only 
students well you again you're running pretty

17:54.412 --> 18:22.832
much the first run movies so the this faculty and 
staff is there too they came oh yes because you're

17:54.412 --> 18:22.832
seeing whatever the first run yeah they've 
already played houston and dallas But now they're

18:23.487 --> 18:28.553
in College Station at Guyon Hall and changing 
twice a week. So faculty and staff and the local

18:29.574 --> 18:35.141
people, anybody want to come see a movie? But sure, 
the big volume of people in the building would be

18:35.161 --> 18:38.465
students. Let's see. Let's talk about the student 
body in general. If liberal means receptive

18:44.252 --> 18:52.161
change and conservative means hesitant 
acceptance of change, Describe the student body

18:53.035 --> 18:55.978
in general. We were conservative. We were 
hesitant to change. Hesitant to change

19:01.183 --> 19:03.365
tradition.

19:06.789 --> 19:15.838
We came mostly from rural backgrounds, which are 
fought change. Rich or poor? Poor for the most

19:18.261 --> 19:20.663
part. Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, what? 
Protestant. Heavily Protestant. Very, very

19:28.709 --> 19:31.312
heavily Protestant. Let's describe the student. 
Do you remember some non-Anglo Protestant

19:34.255 --> 19:39.221
students? A few Mexicans.

19:45.527 --> 19:46.528
Mexican-American? Mexican-American. And how 
were they treated? They were just students. Now,

19:52.216 --> 19:58.202
we had black prejudice, perhaps, in those days. We 
would not have wanted a black student there. But

20:03.187 --> 20:12.436
most of us had gone to high school, and the 
Mexican-Americans were just students in high

20:03.187 --> 20:12.436
school. And so they were just students there. Did 
you have any Jewish

20:15.439 --> 20:21.345
students there? I can't remember a name there as 
freshman. We had, I do as junior and senior. Yes, as

20:31.420 --> 20:33.122
junior and senior, yes. And how were they treated? 
It was just another guy. Just another student. I

20:40.390 --> 20:44.274
mean, again, I didn't find any religious 
prejudice. And we're now talking about a

20:45.575 --> 20:48.999
religious prejudice. And no, I think that There 
was no Catholic prejudice. Maybe I didn't see it.

20:56.191 --> 21:01.598
Maybe it didn't occur to me to be prejudiced 
because of my upbringing. But I knew nothing of

21:01.618 --> 21:10.329
prejudice for Catholic or for Jewish or for Mormon 
or whatever else you might say. Were there any

21:10.369 --> 21:14.614
students from another country? Were there any 
international undergraduate students? I did not

21:17.498 --> 21:20.982
interact with them if there were. They were not in 
my outfit and they were not in industrial

21:21.232 --> 21:25.840
engineering. And in those days, as you narrowed 
down into junior and senior, you closed most of the

21:26.462 --> 21:39.966
rest of the world out from, except for your outfit 
and your department.

21:40.739 --> 21:51.275
Let's see,

21:40.739 --> 21:51.275
we said, well to do or not, okay. Religion. There 
were a few wealthy ones. A friend of mine from Fort

21:55.561 --> 22:02.812
Worth, Cullen Davis, came from a very wealthy 
family. And Cullen was wealthy and his father sent

22:02.832 --> 22:09.902
he and his brothers to A&M because he wanted them to 
be jerked up short from being rich kids. And that's

22:18.121 --> 22:19.903
why he sent them down there. They were nice guys. 
And Cullen was in industrial engineering with me.

22:26.671 --> 22:29.694
And that's, you know, we became friends there.

22:32.958 --> 22:33.579
Let's see. G. Raleigh is built after you? Yes. Yes. 
So DeWare was the basketball game? DeWare was the

22:39.946 --> 22:40.827
field. Describe DeWare,

22:41.047 --> 22:48.193
kind of basketball game setting. Did y'all go? Oh, 
yes. Yes. Physically small. As I recall, seats on

22:54.158 --> 22:58.162
only one side of the basketball court.

23:01.665 --> 23:03.286
It was an old, old building. But DeWare was not 
there yet, no. The assembly hall still existed.

23:12.850 --> 23:20.083
Where the chapel is now, right behind Law and 
Puryear, was the assembly hall. It was a wooden

23:20.143 --> 23:25.232
building.

23:26.292 --> 23:27.974
It still existed. I was in the Aggie Players and we 
performed in the assembly hall. Describe the

23:33.721 --> 23:35.664
Aggie Players. What did they do? It was, we did 
everything. We did comedy, we did Greek, we did

23:40.490 --> 23:48.660
Oedipus and comedy. Who was the director?

23:52.484 --> 23:53.025
Or advisor? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a 
minute. He announced football games for

23:57.259 --> 24:00.082
everybody. C.K.S. C.K.S. Describe him. All 
right, you guys. You guys are so damn stupid you

24:07.512 --> 24:11.417
couldn't learn anything. I like C.K. He was 
straightforward. He didn't mince any words. He

24:16.864 --> 24:17.845
wasn't polite. He used whatever word was most 
appropriate. He didn't care whether you liked it

24:21.470 --> 24:23.653
or not. Is that a fair description of CK? Where was 
his heart? Everywhere. You're inferring he cared

24:31.611 --> 24:33.213
about students? Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Now, as 
long as you did good, he'd say, ah, that's OK. But if

24:43.144 --> 24:47.088
you did bad, he'd tell you everything you did 
wrong. Now, was he the PA announcer at football?

24:54.937 --> 24:55.478
I don't know. I don't want to tell you the truth. 
Forever after that. Ten years later he was, I

24:58.462 --> 25:00.044
believe. Yes, and forever after that he was. 
Because I was there, but one day when he forgot to

25:03.269 --> 25:08.516
flip, he thought he'd flip the switch off. He might 
have said anything. I don't know what he said. He

25:12.462 --> 25:13.604
did, and Mr. Rudder sent a note for him to come to his 
office Monday morning. And C.K. went into the

25:19.692 --> 25:21.495
general's office. Scared. and let her stare the 
hole through it, and then burst out laughing. And

25:28.814 --> 25:36.506
then said, now come on, C. Describe the, we're now 
on the main campus, and you're a sophomore or

25:28.814 --> 25:36.506
higher. Describe the routine of a home football 
weekend. What happened on Friday afternoon,

25:42.856 --> 25:45.460
night, and all day Saturday? After class on 
Friday, you had dinner, and then there was Yelp, I

25:45.580 --> 25:50.728
guess. And everybody formed up and marched to Yale 
practice at the Grove.

25:57.780 --> 25:59.883
Is the bank shell still over at the Grove? I think 
so. Is it still there at the end of the drill field? I

26:03.428 --> 26:03.708
think so. I don't know. I don't know. I haven't 
noticed in years, to tell you the truth. But you

26:07.733 --> 26:11.478
went to the Grove for Yale practice. And with or 
without date, you might have a date. If so, she was

26:15.643 --> 26:16.885
there. And of course I got married while I was going 
to school. So Mary Sue was there for Yale practice.

26:23.852 --> 26:24.694
Now at what time? Was this at midnight? Yes. Okay. 
Yes. And then it was usually back to the Student

26:28.679 --> 26:37.432
Center where there was some kind of entertainment 
going on. And that was Friday night. There

26:42.700 --> 26:44.222
generally were By upperclassman time, you 
weren't scheduling Saturday classes. You

26:49.680 --> 26:51.945
figured out how to get out of that track. And so 
Saturday was a fairly sleep late day. And you would

27:00.014 --> 27:07.762
then get ready for the game, which would normally 
be at 1 o'clock. Because we wanted to get that game

27:08.563 --> 27:12.047
played without lights. Lights. I'm not even sure 
Kyle Field had lights. I'm not certain of it. It may

27:18.354 --> 27:20.156
have. But I don't remember a game. And you played a 
football game at 1 o'clock. so that you were

27:26.356 --> 27:35.871
through by four o'clock and it's still light even 
late into the season and there's plenty of light

27:26.356 --> 27:35.871
for everything. And that went, you went to the 
game. If there was no game, if it was an away game and

27:39.156 --> 27:47.228
not a court trip, you probably didn't go to the 
game. Again, transportation being difficult,

27:47.308 --> 27:50.473
expensive, etc right now but let's go back 
saturday morning slept late you ate the noon meal

27:51.112 --> 28:18.334
about what time oh it was always served early 
probably by 11. and so you would then meet your date

27:51.112 --> 28:18.334
where oh depending on where she stayed you had to 
arrange for her to stay i was lucky in that i could

27:51.112 --> 28:18.334
generally get get Mary Sue into a room at the 
Student Center. You would plan ahead enough to

28:22.367 --> 28:27.054
make sure that you could get her into one there. So 
we'd meet there. And then go down to Duncan and eat.

28:32.322 --> 28:33.724
And then go to the game. You marched in. I had to 
march in. You took your date to the game, got her

28:36.689 --> 28:41.496
inside Playster. Usually you then had to go back 
and you would catch your outfit en route. just in

28:47.018 --> 28:51.563
time to march in, march around the thing. As 
upperclassmen, you'd get away with that,

28:51.703 --> 28:54.667
freshman, sophomore, but. Then as a Saturday 
night, what did y'all eat?

29:02.476 --> 29:06.701
The usual things, maybe a movie, maybe if there was 
something on campus. On a game night, they would

29:08.723 --> 29:14.950
usually, if it was good weather, have something at 
the Grove. which could spill out again, some kind

29:15.520 --> 29:20.688
of music. And you might dance, you might do 
nothing, you know, just one of those things. It

29:27.017 --> 29:31.664
was... Do you remember going to the Cotton Ball? Oh 
yes, yes.

29:37.252 --> 29:38.834
Where was it? The Cotton Ball was held in Sbisa 
because it was physically large. And the Cotton

29:45.187 --> 30:00.863
Queen and so forth, there were delegates elected 
from other, girls elected from other

29:45.187 --> 30:00.863
universities to be delegates to the Cotton Ball. 
And

30:01.824 --> 30:06.729
it went on. And some girl ended up as the Cotton 
Queen. And I don't even know what the selection

30:13.115 --> 30:18.460
process was. What did a young man and young woman 
wear to the cotton ball? A young man wore his

30:22.845 --> 30:25.367
uniform. And a young woman would usually be in a 
long evening dress. Full, you know, full evening

30:32.474 --> 30:36.578
dress. How would you describe the behavior of 
people at the cotton ball? Very formal. Very

30:41.423 --> 30:42.244
formal. As you would expect of the era. How were 
young ladies treated? Oh, my goodness. As queens,

30:50.768 --> 30:53.892
they were of great respect. Oh, yes.

30:57.355 --> 30:58.556
They got a seat. They had a drink. They were taken 
care of. They were waited on hand and foot. Now,

31:04.282 --> 31:07.806
let's make believe you're dating a young lady. 
Would you dance every dance with her? Not

31:10.909 --> 31:11.910
necessarily. How did you dance with someone else? 
Usually you would interchange with a friend's

31:16.807 --> 31:32.890
date, and occasionally, the men always 
outnumbered the men, some of your friends who did

31:16.807 --> 31:32.890
not have dates would probably dance with yours

31:16.807 --> 31:32.890
at the time. And the big bands were there. Oh, yeah. 
What were the other big dances? There was a

31:40.220 --> 31:41.121
military...
