WEBVTT

00:03.997 --> 00:12.145
go get something to eat, and we're driving down the road there, and the whole front end of the car just collapses on the wheels.

00:12.205 --> 00:15.808
And I said, man, I broke his Cadillac, you know.

00:15.828 --> 00:16.729
And I hated to call him.

00:16.789 --> 00:24.517
I called him, and he, boy, he comes over and apologizes about that old car he gave me and everything.

00:24.537 --> 00:30.983
I've never been in a car like that except when they recruited me to pick me up down there, but I was driving, and boy, I felt terrible about it.

00:31.621 --> 00:38.441
And years later, his son, Andy Elliott, was on my board at the association.

00:39.323 --> 00:40.888
Banker, Austin.

00:41.375 --> 00:54.619
and we're talking about that car and he said yeah my brother and I used to get that car and go out and hunt jackrabbits in it and we messed those springs up out there and we didn't want to tell mother about it and I said I could have killed him you know.

00:54.639 --> 01:04.277
But anyway that's that was our first date we'd kind of been an Aggie in those days you didn't get to have much contact with females so

01:04.257 --> 01:10.426
We'd try to see each other once in a while and finally after my junior year at A&M we married.

01:10.666 --> 01:11.547
Then it got serious.

01:12.348 --> 01:14.631
So you come back to school the spring of your sophomore year?

01:14.652 --> 01:22.182
I come back to spring and it was a, at that point I'd been trained all through the

01:22.567 --> 01:28.916
went to the Olympics in the fall, and I'm really in good shape, and I start out throwing well.

01:29.036 --> 01:34.784
And then early that year, I meet in College Station, I throw 67-11, which breaks the world record.

01:36.967 --> 01:39.370
And that kind of took the pressure off then.

01:40.872 --> 01:45.158
So two weeks later, I'm throwing in Austin.

01:46.860 --> 01:50.565
Without that pressure, I've had the record, and I throw 69.

01:51.237 --> 01:56.823
and it's not going to count because they didn't have a, the ring was not official.

01:58.325 --> 02:00.607
And that's typical of their deals over there, you know.

02:00.787 --> 02:04.291
But I mean, I really threw well over and Austin was a great place to throw.

02:04.311 --> 02:06.814
I told them it was because of that orange wall out there I wanted to tear down.

02:06.854 --> 02:14.762
And so before, they're going to submit it, but it's probably not going to count because it didn't have a metal raised rimmer in it.

02:15.663 --> 02:21.109
And we come back for the Southwest Conference meeting in Kyle Field.

02:22.456 --> 02:31.168
And I threw 70 feet 5 1⁄2 inches, which is the first 70-foot throw, and broke the world records.

02:31.188 --> 02:32.349
I didn't have to worry about the Austin.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.292
They never submitted it as a record.

02:36.034 --> 02:40.460
The problem with that was, I mean, that was a great relief.

02:40.520 --> 02:51.535
I think if I had been throwing 69 and set, you know, right close to it, the pressure would have probably been a lot greater than it was because it kind of, I really didn't think I would throw 70 feet that year.

02:51.515 --> 02:55.200
But because of that, everywhere I went after that, they expected me to throw 70.

02:55.260 --> 03:07.095
And I remember a week later, I'm at the Coliseum Relays in Los Angeles, a big crowd, and I threw 67, 11, which is still fun than anybody had ever thrown before, except me.

03:07.736 --> 03:10.600
And they booed when I didn't throw 70 feet.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.883
So they kind of put it all in perspective.

03:12.983 --> 03:15.126
I knew the pressure was going to be on from then on.

03:15.106 --> 03:19.091
When you threw 70, did you call anybody special?

03:19.351 --> 03:21.073
Well, my mother and dad.

03:21.354 --> 03:21.934
What'd they say?

03:22.455 --> 03:26.179
Well, they were thrilled, but they never got too high about stuff, you know.

03:26.239 --> 03:28.802
They were happy for me and kept up with me.

03:30.505 --> 03:33.228
But, you know, they handled it just right.

03:33.288 --> 03:39.736
They never made it so that they thought they would be disappointed if I didn't do well.

03:39.796 --> 03:41.097
They'd just be disappointed for me.

03:41.197 --> 03:42.959
But they always knew what I was doing.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.062
Everywhere I went, I called them in front.

03:45.042 --> 03:51.014
Now, when you came back to school here, did you live on the campus?

03:51.034 --> 03:51.815
Yes, I stayed in the dorm.

03:51.915 --> 03:52.677
Still in Hart?

03:53.017 --> 03:57.246
Yeah, they moved us over to Dorm 15, they called it then, Fowler.

03:57.406 --> 04:06.223
They moved to Spring Sports and we all grumbled because it was air conditioned and carpeted, but they had all these rules and stuff and we were old Hart Hall guys.

04:06.473 --> 04:10.798
I used to like to take my shot put and roll it down the steps late at night.

04:11.259 --> 04:13.041
There's old concrete and metal, you couldn't hurt it.

04:13.462 --> 04:22.092
And so you had these ramps and you get your shot put up there and you start to see how far it'd go down and listen to everybody hollering and complaining that you'd wake up.

04:22.172 --> 04:24.035
And we were able to do things like that.

04:24.075 --> 04:25.256
We couldn't do it the other place.

04:27.018 --> 04:34.528
What kind of jokes or pranks or good bull did you athletes gauge in?

04:34.548 --> 04:36.430
Oh, there was always, there was always

04:37.490 --> 04:38.472
something going on.

04:38.512 --> 04:54.697
They found out or it became pretty common that I was afraid of snakes and it's strange because my youngest son is one of his fields in genetics is snakes.

04:54.757 --> 05:01.388
I mean at one time we had 20 snakes in our house since then but I was afraid of snakes and

05:01.520 --> 05:26.143
I even got me a rubber snake trying to get used to them and laid out there and I'd jump every time I'd walk in my room you know so I was trying to get like a phobia almost you know I see a picture of them so well some of the guys they had this swimmer that lived in the dorm and said Matson would think it'd be good bull if you go catch him a snake down there you know they're always going down the river and swimming and so he called it it was a pretty good size water snake wouldn't hurt you

05:26.123 --> 05:34.218
And he came to the front door and I opened that door and he's holding that snake and hands it to me and I about had a heart attack.

05:34.899 --> 05:43.575
But I got him the next day and Hart, I mean Fowler then or his dorm 15, all the doors open like a motel out and we're on the fourth floor.

05:44.213 --> 05:49.978
And I picked him up and held him out over that edge and said, I don't want to see any more snakes up here, you know.

05:49.998 --> 05:55.003
So the swimmers got the message, I don't want to see any more snakes up there, because I was scared to death of them.

05:55.023 --> 06:04.792
I remember one time in the dorm, the Corps guys used to have to march by there, and people, every once in a while, non-regs would throw water on them when they were marching to chow over there.

06:04.852 --> 06:09.597
And we weren't involved in it, we were just sitting watching, but there was a little of that going on.

06:09.617 --> 06:10.778
Well, some upperclassmen,

06:12.023 --> 06:16.450
have a freshman run over there and throw a bucket of water on me.

06:16.770 --> 06:17.972
And I'm just sitting over watching.

06:19.094 --> 06:23.641
And he comes over there and just hits me with this water, you know.

06:23.701 --> 06:27.307
He doesn't know who I am or anything, so I take you out after him.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.612
And I catch him and tackle him.

06:30.632 --> 06:34.998
And the bucket, his trash can falls over and it's all mashed up.

06:35.018 --> 06:37.562
And I pick him up and, you know, what am I gonna do?

06:37.622 --> 06:40.647
I mean, the guy was sent over there and I just pat him on the head.

06:41.133 --> 06:50.879
and he went on his way you know and the next day he shows up at my front door with his trash can all mashed up and wanted me to autograph it.

06:52.463 --> 06:54.548
So I thought that was a good bull so I autographed it.

06:55.050 --> 06:56.273
Next day I get a call from

06:57.164 --> 07:03.876
I think they called them Dean of Students in those days or whatever they called them, Dean of Men or whatever they called them.

07:04.037 --> 07:08.305
Bridge of Brazil, I think who it was when you come see him, which is not a good thing.

07:09.186 --> 07:14.075
They never called you to come over and just see how you're feeling and everything going okay.

07:14.937 --> 07:19.425
So I go over and he said, now you're not in trouble or anything, but I just have heard this story.

07:20.570 --> 07:25.457
that this freshman threw water on you, and when you caught him, he bent the trash can over his head.

07:26.038 --> 07:27.159
And that story still lives.

07:27.219 --> 07:38.495
I mean, I've had people swear that they saw me do it, and that trash can fell off down there and got all mashed up, but it made a better story that I took it and bent it over that freshman's head.

07:39.176 --> 07:40.998
Did Mr. Brazil breathe?

07:41.038 --> 07:46.746
I don't know whether he believed in me or not, but there was no punishment attached to it, so.

07:46.726 --> 07:48.089
I got off of that.

07:48.570 --> 07:56.630
Where did, if you and your friends wanted to relax on a Saturday night in those months, what did y'all do?

07:56.790 --> 07:58.614
Well, not much.

07:58.634 --> 08:02.063
We'd go to the drive-in movie or the campus theater.

08:02.103 --> 08:05.190
There was a circle drive-in or the campus theater.

08:05.609 --> 08:13.217
A lot of Saturday nights you know we're going to track meets and when the indoor season started getting and then outdoor there wasn't a whole lot of time.

08:13.257 --> 08:16.100
The year I played basketball the whole year I was tied up.

08:16.180 --> 08:23.087
But you know we'd go to Houston with somebody or Austin some, a little I don't remember a lot of that.

08:23.447 --> 08:27.812
Thursday night was a night we might go to Sam Houston State to see if we could get a date.

08:28.432 --> 08:33.017
The way you had to do it in those days is somebody had to have a contact and you'd drive over with them.

08:32.997 --> 08:39.066
They'd go in the dorm, they'd call upstairs, and then you'd kind of jockey for position as they came down.

08:40.168 --> 08:44.374
And if you were a little slow, then you got the last pick.

08:44.394 --> 08:47.539
And we did that a few times, but that didn't work out too well for us.

08:47.559 --> 08:50.904
But that was a common thing for Aggies to go over there.

08:50.924 --> 08:56.032
Right, then once you had that date, where did y'all go in Huntsville?

08:56.052 --> 09:00.118
Just get something, there wasn't much to do, you know, get something to eat.

09:00.098 --> 09:01.740
There wasn't a whole lot to do.

09:01.800 --> 09:02.621
I don't remember what we did.

09:03.663 --> 09:05.245
Just to be around girls, you know.

09:05.265 --> 09:09.290
And I'm assuming some of the girls were probably pretty bored too with the dates they ended up with.

09:09.310 --> 09:15.378
Yeah, I don't think they thought they had any, you know, because there was kind of a stigma on the girls that would date Aggies anyway over, you know.

09:15.398 --> 09:19.003
Now who, you didn't have a car yet, or did you?

09:19.023 --> 09:20.005
No, well.

09:20.545 --> 09:21.306
Who had wheels?

09:22.027 --> 09:22.368
Donnie?

09:22.408 --> 09:23.629
Donnie had had a car.

09:23.870 --> 09:24.891
Okay.

09:24.871 --> 09:43.825
and his parents checked the speedometer on it so we had to disconnect that because they they were pretty it wasn't even being serious and then I bought a 56 Chevrolet from my dad probably my sophomore year and brought it back and it wasn't real

09:44.564 --> 10:00.025
reliable it would and so there's always somebody could work on it but the way i financed the gas was and the gas was like a dollar and a quarter gallon in those days i mean excuse me 25 cents a gallon in those days about 26 25 cents

10:00.005 --> 10:08.917
And the way I financed it, I left the keys and the floorboard and parked it under a tree by Guyon Hall, which wasn't an official spot.

10:09.437 --> 10:13.643
And I made it almost that year without getting a ticket, finding out that it wasn't registered.

10:13.663 --> 10:14.884
We never registered.

10:14.965 --> 10:19.110
But anybody in the dorm that wanted to go to

10:19.090 --> 10:45.435
only place you went really was to go get something at the mall which the manor east mall or gibson's go to gibson's or maybe it's a roppy's on sunday but you just go get it and drive it and put a dollar's worth of gas in it which give me about four gallons and so it was kind of the community deal i took it out to easterwood one time and somebody stole the transmission out of it while i was going and i gave it to a guy to fix it could work on them and

10:45.415 --> 10:49.039
And then he fixed it up and finally sold it.

10:49.080 --> 10:55.928
But it got to be kind of a clunker, but that's the only transportation we had.

10:55.968 --> 10:56.789
But we didn't need a lot.

10:57.570 --> 11:00.894
If you all were going to go eat, where did you go off campus?

11:00.914 --> 11:01.855
Where did you all go?

11:01.875 --> 11:03.898
Well you had about three choices.

11:03.918 --> 11:07.322
You'd go to Underwoods, which is an old college.

11:08.737 --> 11:10.859
And they had the Aggie Special.

11:10.979 --> 11:11.980
Underwoods or Youngbloods?

11:12.020 --> 11:13.061
Youngbloods.

11:13.081 --> 11:13.321
Youngbloods.

11:13.341 --> 11:14.643
Youngbloods, not Underwood.

11:14.663 --> 11:15.984
Underwood is a barbecue place.

11:16.064 --> 11:18.626
It wasn't here.

11:18.646 --> 11:24.953
It was Youngbloods or Wormans, which is out off of 21, I guess, or over in Bryan.

11:25.113 --> 11:26.094
It was a long way over there.

11:26.554 --> 11:28.936
Ours are Rappi's.

11:28.956 --> 11:29.937
Or Coach Norton's.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.820
Now that was a, but the general couldn't afford to do that.

11:33.301 --> 11:34.862
After I married later on, we had,

11:35.095 --> 11:58.875
upgraded and went to coach norton right and as you and this young lady get serious how do y'all communicate did you call telephone letters didn't get to see each other too much she'd get to come a little bit and uh now she she was serious about going church is that right right and did you get serious yeah because the only ways on sunday nights or wednesday nights i could ever when we

11:58.855 --> 12:05.691
went home in the summer and could be with her if I had to go to church first and got doing that and then started going on my own here.

12:06.453 --> 12:12.848
All right, now I have always assumed that with your basic attitudes about life,

12:13.638 --> 12:16.704
that denomination fit in well.

12:16.824 --> 12:17.685
Do you think that's right?

12:19.729 --> 12:20.130
Probably.

12:20.931 --> 12:29.126
It probably did because it's pretty disciplined, conservative, and, you know, I think so.

12:29.327 --> 12:36.760
I think it was, in spite of, you know, just wanting to be with her, I think it all fit in well.

12:36.740 --> 12:40.645
So you started going to the Church of Christ here at Northgate?

12:41.727 --> 12:43.850
Were there any special friends that went with you?

12:44.811 --> 12:45.812
No, not really.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.975
There were some people over I knew.

12:50.178 --> 12:50.599
Such as?

12:50.679 --> 12:52.622
Well, Coach Stalin went there.

12:55.085 --> 12:58.109
But you got to know people over there.

13:00.672 --> 13:06.240
I got to know a number of people I'm still close to today from my student days there.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.403
if there were students or otherwise.

13:08.723 --> 13:11.286
Was this young fellow named Robert Walker yet back?

13:13.289 --> 13:15.191
No, I think he was in California then.

13:15.251 --> 13:16.953
I did not know him then.

13:16.973 --> 13:19.176
I think he was still at Pepperdine in California.

13:19.276 --> 13:23.041
Then he kind of came back after I'd kind of left him there.

13:23.802 --> 13:27.927
What did you and your buddies, how did y'all dress for class since you weren't in the Corps?

13:27.947 --> 13:34.455
Well we had to wear, generally wore jeans and a shirt, usually with a collar on it.

13:35.431 --> 13:43.730
In the summer some classes you could wear Bermuda shorts in, you never wore workout stuff.

13:43.790 --> 13:44.451
What kind of shoes?

13:45.995 --> 13:48.621
Never wore athletic shoes, you wore regular shoes.

13:48.641 --> 13:53.271
And I remember I had a speech professor.

13:53.251 --> 13:57.656
I'm trying to think of his name.

13:57.757 --> 13:59.138
It wasn't C.K.S.

13:59.198 --> 14:01.441
No, but it was just about like him.

14:05.186 --> 14:10.432
He wrote me a poem, I still have, that would really touch me because I was scared to death of the guy.

14:10.452 --> 14:11.013
He was rough.

14:11.674 --> 14:15.799
Anyway, I came in in shorts and whites.

14:16.184 --> 14:19.211
socks with my regular loafer shoes.

14:20.935 --> 14:29.556
And I don't know why, I didn't have a tendency to be a smart aleck, but he said, Mr. Matt, you know there's a university regulation that says you can wear them in shorts, but you have to have long socks.

14:31.220 --> 14:34.227
And I had them come to the bottom of my calf and I said, well,

14:35.455 --> 14:38.721
For a regular guy, those socks would be longer than me."

14:38.741 --> 14:39.722
He said, that's a good answer.

14:40.464 --> 14:41.585
And let me wear them, you know.

14:42.166 --> 14:47.856
But I thought I could have gotten in big trouble because I think I was being a smart addict, but I was just trying to figure out how to get out of this.

14:47.956 --> 14:55.489
But anyway it was, you know,

14:57.933 --> 15:00.618
You know, I don't ever remember, I see them now wearing athletic stuff.

15:00.659 --> 15:02.863
I don't know if there's any ruling in it.

15:02.883 --> 15:08.534
Now we, at A&M, you didn't wear any of your high school jackets or anything like that.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.158
You had to take the letters off of them if you did.

15:10.979 --> 15:13.765
Did you even bring any of your... No.

15:13.745 --> 15:18.711
And then you didn't wear, like you wouldn't wear another school's T-shirt like they do now.

15:18.731 --> 15:20.733
I mean I really get on with kids when I see them.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.517
They'll be wearing an SMU or Notre Dame or something.

15:24.537 --> 15:27.941
I said man you'd be in big trouble back in our day and they'd think we're crazy.

15:29.062 --> 15:32.085
And you stayed with your major, you never thought about changing.

15:32.125 --> 15:38.132
Did you have any course that really gave you a problem?

15:38.112 --> 15:40.877
That was a real difficult?

15:41.117 --> 15:42.901
Well, not in my major so much.

15:42.981 --> 15:50.093
I mean there were, I had some professors that were challenged, you know, that I have good memories of.

15:50.133 --> 15:53.860
Herb Thompson was the one that I mean, you know,

15:53.840 --> 15:58.186
He was one of those guys that was a little intimidating, you know, to you.

15:59.407 --> 16:04.854
And he understood that he expected you to act a certain way in class and there was a factor in his grade.

16:04.894 --> 16:07.117
He wasn't sure exactly what it was that could determine.

16:07.878 --> 16:11.843
That could influence your final grade by how you sat in your chair and how you acted.

16:11.883 --> 16:16.289
So he said just keep that in mind, which you did, you know.

16:17.290 --> 16:20.775
But he basically expected you to learn

16:21.903 --> 16:45.531
what he taught you and he told you what was most important and it was a lot of rote to it you just had to almost memorize and you do a lot of it but today I remember some of those things he taught me about marketing research and which is not a particularly glamorous or exciting kind of class you would think but he was an excellent teacher and

16:45.511 --> 17:06.500
and helped a lot of students later on you know I mean he had tremendous contacts in the business world and helped people with jobs and they called him and looking for uh Aggies would call and looking for uh employees you know anybody he recommended would do well and and and he was a good good teacher he was hard and demanding a lot.

17:06.860 --> 17:12.328
Who were some of the other teachers that you now look back on with great appreciation?

17:12.848 --> 17:20.500
Well you know it's been so long I'd probably forget some that I would think of.

17:24.246 --> 17:37.827
Well there's a marketing professor, Jerry DeHaye, he later became a dean at, oh I guess he was, I guess he ended up at North Texas maybe, a dean at Tarleton for a while.

17:39.646 --> 17:49.660
I had about two or three marketing classes and he had a real interest in the students and he worked for Procter & Gamble so he could relate the real life thing to you.

17:53.786 --> 18:06.463
I remember I had a graduate student who didn't like any of them, wasn't playing on a stand and taught a math survey class, the last math hurdle I had to get through and so I put it off as long as I could.

18:07.051 --> 18:11.209
And he didn't like having to teach.

18:11.772 --> 18:13.821
He was just out of sorts with the whole thing.

18:14.442 --> 18:17.386
And had very few graduate students that actually taught us in those days.

18:17.947 --> 18:22.714
And this was kind of a basic survey class, that's why you had him doing it.

18:22.734 --> 18:26.520
And I really struggled because you had a little of everything in there.

18:27.201 --> 18:33.410
And when I left I knew I'd fail that class and I'm going to have to work out something to get back on my schedule, you know.

18:33.771 --> 18:39.960
So I mean I went home and told Mother and Dad I may have to go to summer school, you know, and I don't know how I'm going to do that with all the track meets coming up.

18:41.071 --> 18:44.562
a grade report in the mail a few days after I got home.

18:44.602 --> 18:46.970
It said I made a D, which I was the happiest.

18:46.990 --> 18:50.541
It was the only D I made and was the happiest grade I had.

18:51.635 --> 18:54.960
And I got back and I just had to go ask if he gave it to me, you know.

18:56.242 --> 19:06.818
And he looked at him and said no, he pulled out his book and said you had a 48 average and I'm a straight curve guy and 47 is a F and you made a D. I said that's all I want to know.

19:06.838 --> 19:10.804
And I was glad to get good out of there and he didn't give me a thing.

19:11.004 --> 19:18.115
But of course you know Fred Smith who taught me geology and some of those guys I got to know

19:19.310 --> 19:22.174
you know, later on, you know.

19:23.656 --> 19:29.764
Looking back, do you remember any courses in which you got a grade that you felt you didn't deserve, either plus or minus?

19:31.166 --> 19:32.868
No, I really don't.

19:33.969 --> 19:37.994
You know, I... Nobody graded you higher or lower than you?

19:38.055 --> 19:39.296
Not that I know of, you know.

19:40.117 --> 19:43.782
I had one professor, an English professor, I can't remember his name now,

19:44.504 --> 19:53.276
that we were told that you know if you got in there you're in trouble if you're an athlete and I drew it and in those days you didn't know who your professor was.

19:53.356 --> 20:07.795
I mean you spent more time trying to figure out who your professor was if there's any way and in some departments you couldn't find out at all and so you went in there and sat down and he's writing his name on the board

20:08.180 --> 20:16.332
and talking to us and he said, by the way, if I've got any athletes in here, it's not impossible to pass, but I've never had one.

20:16.352 --> 20:29.692
And we got, there was four of us back there, and we got up and just backed out, you know, keeping our eyes, not even afraid he was going to turn around, and went out the door and went down and got us, said we can't take that class at that time, we've got to work out, and had to talk our way out of getting out of it.

20:29.712 --> 20:32.737
It wasn't an easy thing to get out of a class and get in another one in those days.

20:33.698 --> 20:37.444
But, you know, I think that...

20:37.424 --> 20:47.362
You know I would assume I guess with the more knowledge and the kind of faculty they have it may be harder today but I think the faculty members challenged you in those days pretty good and expected a lot out of you.

20:48.344 --> 21:01.288
Not just what you learned but you know you expected you to show up and and like some of them said you know PR is going to be part of your life so you better practice a little bit of it with me you know.

21:01.505 --> 21:07.655
Were there any, as far as you and your buddies were aware, were there any giveaway courses in that era?

21:07.675 --> 21:08.456
Yes.

21:08.476 --> 21:09.037
Where were they?

21:09.258 --> 21:15.247
There was music appreciation, but I was afraid to try it because I figured they'd switch on it.

21:15.788 --> 21:19.935
There was one math course and I got in there.

21:20.303 --> 21:39.122
because math was my challenge and it was a lot of old quizzes floating around so all the athletes would try to get in that math class and the first day I woke in and the regular professor I mean we had it right but he's sick

21:40.722 --> 21:46.451
And we about flunked out after that first test and he finally got back and finally got out of it.

21:46.491 --> 21:54.224
But, you know, it was the first semester that everybody didn't make an A. There was a few classes like that, but not very many.

21:54.825 --> 21:58.711
There wasn't any basket weaving kind of deals that you used to have for athletes.

21:58.731 --> 22:00.334
They didn't have special classes, you know.

22:00.314 --> 22:02.017
There weren't any for athletes?

22:02.037 --> 22:02.217
No.

22:02.938 --> 22:10.131
And this one where you said there's an old test, what you're saying is that he didn't change the quiz as much from year to year.

22:10.171 --> 22:11.032
No, and didn't care.

22:11.773 --> 22:17.563
You know, I mean, so it wasn't like, I guess you rationalize and not cheat him, because he would say, you know.

22:17.543 --> 22:24.362
You know, if you're resourceful enough to help me, and the Corps guys had tremendous quiz files in those days.

22:24.783 --> 22:30.218
And so you, it was to your benefit to, not just to find the old quiz, but to study for a quiz, you know.

22:30.940 --> 22:32.143
They had a lot of

22:32.630 --> 22:42.340
A lot of files and access to classes, you know, and information on what kind of quiz, you know, you may have six of the professor's old quizzes and the odds of you having a lot of questions the same.

22:43.121 --> 22:47.506
And so we had a lot of friends in the Corps, you know, that would come over and study it.

22:47.526 --> 22:52.551
At first they wanted to get away from where they were at, you know, and so they could come over to our dorm where they're not hassled.

22:53.172 --> 22:56.816
And then, you know, we had access to some of their quiz files.

22:57.136 --> 23:00.460
Who did you turn to for academic advice counsel?

23:00.440 --> 23:06.805
My brother, I just talked to him the other day.

23:08.641 --> 23:09.402
You know who it is.

23:09.442 --> 23:11.564
Not McCandless.

23:11.684 --> 23:12.044
No, no.

23:12.204 --> 23:18.910
They hired an academic advisor, and he went out to consolidate it for a long time.

23:18.930 --> 23:19.231
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

23:19.251 --> 23:21.853
Yes, yes, yes.

23:21.873 --> 23:22.473
Buddy Denton.

23:22.493 --> 23:24.275
Buddy Denton.

23:24.415 --> 23:34.604
But basically, you know, and he would try to advise you on, basically advise you on professors and stuff and, you know, what you need to graduate, and he would do that.

23:34.745 --> 23:36.006
You had to make the initiative.

23:36.046 --> 23:38.648
They didn't babysit you, you know, especially if you were a

23:38.628 --> 24:07.707
track guy you know or something if you're a football player they want to make sure you went to class and they check on you that way you're on your own to do that which was best but he would he was a good guy and really cared and tried there's one guy now they have a whole staff of people that and computers to keep up with it basically it was to help you get the schedule they let you in the side door and and then you you know you know you knew what you had to take to stay on track

24:08.176 --> 24:11.360
And that was most of the academic advising.

24:11.380 --> 24:14.865
And if you had a problem you could go see them, which you did from time to time.

24:14.885 --> 24:18.770
But generally in those days you wouldn't see your professor, you know what I mean.

24:18.790 --> 24:23.296
Very few professors I had I was uncomfortable not going in or they acted like they didn't want you to come by.

24:24.318 --> 24:26.240
And I think that helped.

24:26.380 --> 24:30.566
Not that it made them grade you any different, but they knew you were interested in trying.

24:31.567 --> 24:34.732
Do you remember anybody trying to pull off any pranks in class?

24:36.474 --> 24:37.255
Any good bull?

24:39.968 --> 24:41.490
You know, I don't remember a lot of that.

24:41.851 --> 25:08.929
We were about half afraid of, you know, we had a bunch of old retired colonels as professors and stuff, you know, and I don't know, there was just kind of, in our day it seemed like, you know, I know there was some stuff, you know, that went on and, but you know, I don't, I'm sure we had some of that, but you know, I had Judge Stewart in class, you know, and that was always interesting and he harassed everybody, you know, that was part of his style, but he was a good teacher.

25:08.909 --> 25:11.233
and taught business law.

25:12.435 --> 25:17.142
And other than snakes, you all didn't have much dormitory pranks?

25:17.223 --> 25:21.450
Oh, water fights and all that kind of stuff.

25:21.510 --> 25:23.373
A water fight, describe a water fight.

25:23.653 --> 25:25.416
Well, it was just

25:25.396 --> 25:31.205
It wasn't quite like the core fights, but we'd get trash cans full of water and throw on each other.

25:31.245 --> 25:35.271
They kind of cut a lot of that out when we moved over to Dorm 15.

25:35.431 --> 25:37.835
Who had to clean up the mess?

25:39.017 --> 25:41.200
Well, you just cleaned up your own room.

25:41.220 --> 25:43.123
Nobody came in and did that.

25:43.564 --> 25:48.291
Over in Dorm 15, describe what was in it.

25:49.253 --> 25:50.595
Well, Dorm 15 was nice.

25:50.635 --> 25:52.197
It was carpeted and had a bed.

25:52.177 --> 25:55.162
Each one had a desk and had a bath in between the two rooms.

25:55.202 --> 25:56.804
That was like moving to a motel.

25:56.904 --> 26:06.740
Now Hart Halls, where we started out, was cinder block, concrete floor, and one bathroom to a floor and had three rooms to a floor.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.384
And you had to go all the way down to go to the next ramp.

26:10.486 --> 26:14.472
Which was really nice, you know, you had a lot more privacy and stuff that way.

26:14.452 --> 26:22.701
So, but we liked it because they didn't care if you stuck stuff on the wall and the new place had wall coverings and stuff and you couldn't, couldn't do anything to it.

26:22.721 --> 26:25.363
Now you and Donnie roomed together over there.

26:25.383 --> 26:28.527
And what kind of, y'all have radio, didn't have TV?

26:28.647 --> 26:29.928
No TV, had radio.

26:30.869 --> 26:34.533
Wouldn't let you have stuff to cook with and stuff in your dorms and afraid you'd burn it down.

26:35.154 --> 26:36.235
Didn't have little refrigerators.

26:36.255 --> 26:39.318
Some of them had TVs, some of them started to get, started to have little TVs.

26:39.338 --> 26:43.182
And no micro, no, and no little refrigerator.

26:43.422 --> 26:44.003
No.

26:44.287 --> 26:47.996
Did anybody in the dorm have any alcohol in their room?

26:49.079 --> 26:53.269
You know they might bring it in on Saturday night but they didn't keep it in the room up there too much.

26:53.931 --> 26:54.873
What about smoking?

26:54.893 --> 26:56.437
Did they smoke in the dorms then?

26:57.500 --> 26:58.903
Not in the track you know.

26:59.187 --> 27:03.795
I'm sure that there's guys that did, but I, you know, I didn't, I don't remember a lot of that.

27:03.936 --> 27:07.222
Were you even aware of the word marijuana?

27:07.242 --> 27:08.484
No.

27:08.504 --> 27:09.827
And you hadn't heard of heroin?

27:09.867 --> 27:11.750
Not then, no, not then.

27:12.672 --> 27:19.825
Drugs were really something we maybe heard about, but as far as seeing, it was a long time after I got out of school for it.

27:19.845 --> 27:22.630
As far as you were aware, where did people buy beer?

27:23.774 --> 27:25.396
and campus kids?

27:26.057 --> 27:28.961
Well I think in those days they still went across the river down here.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.305
I think that was just before the end of that.

27:32.286 --> 27:38.014
But then they could start you know by then they started having beer in 7-Elevens and stuff I think a little bit.

27:40.277 --> 27:42.340
Did you ever go to the clay pits?

27:42.556 --> 27:44.439
Where some of them went swimming?

27:45.200 --> 27:45.300
Yeah.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.924
Did you ever go on one of the parties out at, down at the river?

27:48.946 --> 27:53.633
Well, there was, yeah, I went down to the river some before school started every year.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.656
Describe that.

27:55.777 --> 27:57.479
It's all kind of, that's kind of hazy to me.

27:57.519 --> 28:05.312
I wasn't a big party person and I'd go down there, you know, and those guys would drink beer and stuff, but I was pretty serious, you know.

28:05.332 --> 28:06.053
I didn't want to do anything.

28:06.073 --> 28:08.817
I was going to get myself hurt, get myself in trouble.

28:09.202 --> 28:15.590
I felt like I had a little bit of obligation or quite a bit of obligation to to not get in trouble.

28:16.811 --> 28:37.015
I remember I found out we went out to one thing I did we we left my freshman year during the season right the first part we we had a weekend off coach had to go recruit so we're supposed to work out well

28:36.995 --> 28:47.112
a high jumper named Woods that had a car, a good car, and Sebastian, Jim Sebastian, knew some girls in Lubbock, four of us, and Donnie and I, we drove to Lubbock for a day.

28:47.272 --> 28:48.694
I mean, that's pretty bad shape.

28:48.714 --> 28:49.375
From here to Lubbock?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.439
Yeah, drive eight hours, you know, to have a day.

28:52.460 --> 28:53.302
So we drive out there.

28:53.362 --> 28:57.128
Sebastian doesn't show up the next day, and he's been in a serious automobile accident.

28:57.589 --> 29:03.238
They got out of a car, and somebody crushed him between it and about lost his legs and could have killed him.

29:03.826 --> 29:17.015
Well by the time we tracked him down, he's in the hospital and it's been on the radio that I was in an accident out there, my parents have heard it, General Rutter's heard it, he calls Coach Thomas.

29:17.876 --> 29:21.885
Coach Thomas said no they've got to be there working out, they ain't not out there at Lubbock you know.

29:22.135 --> 29:34.053
And coach never said anything to me about not being here, but when we got back we were pretty, the three of us, and Jim took him a long time to rehabilitate and, you know, really had serious injuries.

29:34.073 --> 29:34.995
He was a real tough guy.

29:35.015 --> 29:36.177
He wouldn't have done as well as he did.

29:36.898 --> 29:43.047
But I learned right then that I just got to be extra careful, you know, because, you know,

29:44.849 --> 29:47.175
the publicity and stuff.

29:47.215 --> 29:52.307
You just have to maybe give up some things that people normally do, you know, to have fun, maybe.

29:52.327 --> 29:58.622
Did any reporter ever allege any wrongdoing, scandal or anything connected with you?

30:00.408 --> 30:02.550
No, you know, I don't think so.

30:02.810 --> 30:04.572
I don't remember anything like that.

30:04.652 --> 30:09.277
I know I stayed mad at some sometime, but it was usually, you know, some other.

30:09.818 --> 30:17.085
Because I don't remember any stories where you allegedly took any money, where you allegedly were drinking or anything like that.

30:17.205 --> 30:17.986
No, I never.

30:19.127 --> 30:22.791
They probably made fun of me because I was so squeaky clean or something.

30:24.913 --> 30:27.216
Surely you must have sampled alcohol at some point.

30:27.236 --> 30:27.756
Yes, I did.

30:28.117 --> 30:29.318
In high school or where?

30:29.298 --> 30:30.972
No, I'm mostly here at A&M.

30:31.557 --> 30:34.482
That's about the only time that I read, but not a lot.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.278
Was it that you didn't like it?

30:36.479 --> 30:44.267
Well I didn't really like it, but also everything I did in those days I evaluated is it going to help me get a world record or not.

30:44.287 --> 30:45.187
That's the impression I had.

30:45.207 --> 30:49.732
And so, you know, I was kind of single minded on that, maybe too much in some ways.

30:50.433 --> 31:00.503
You know as a kid I remember not wanting to go skiing and stuff like that when I was competing, you know, because I couldn't take a chance on an injury, you know.

31:01.006 --> 31:02.127
But, you know, I enjoyed it.

31:02.227 --> 31:03.108
I enjoyed training.

31:03.148 --> 31:04.630
I enjoyed working out.

31:04.650 --> 31:07.453
The worst part was having to get on an airplane and go to a track meet somewhere.

31:07.513 --> 31:12.779
But I enjoyed trying to do a little better and lifting weights over on Saturday morning.

31:12.839 --> 31:14.541
Everybody said, you know, you're really dedicated.

31:14.901 --> 31:17.043
That's nothing I'd rather have been doing, you know.

31:29.831 --> 31:31.534
If I didn't, I wouldn't go to breakfast.

31:31.554 --> 31:36.162
And then every once in a while they'd get on a kick of requiring, you know, a scholarship to go to breakfast.

31:37.004 --> 31:37.906
So you all ate in?

31:38.406 --> 31:39.328
Usually you get up at seven.

31:39.789 --> 31:42.353
And you ate in Cebisa?

31:42.794 --> 31:43.015
Yes.

31:43.355 --> 31:44.257
What was the typical breakfast?

31:44.277 --> 31:45.479
