00:02.883 --> 00:08.789
I'm Sean interviewing Carl Sagan on October 19, 
1993, at Boulder, Colorado. Now, Carl, for the

00:10.171 --> 00:13.054
record, would you give us your full name? My name is 
Carl Edward Sagan. Okay, and when and where were

00:17.559 --> 00:18.941
you born? November 9, 1934, Brooklyn, New York.

00:25.568 --> 00:29.272
When did you first get interested in astronomy? 
About age five.

00:33.646 --> 00:36.310
What part of astronomy did you get interested in, 
and how did that happen? I describe this in my book,

00:37.892 --> 00:44.200
Cosmos, and it's done much better there than I can 
do it here. It's chapter six, I think. Where

00:47.926 --> 00:53.573
did you go to undergraduate school? I got all my 
earned degrees, all four of them, at the

00:53.754 --> 00:56.658
University of Chicago. When did you get your 
bachelor's degree? I got... A BA in 1954 and a BS in

01:01.507 --> 01:07.236
physics in 1955. Did you ever take any astronomy 
classes as an undergraduate? As an

01:11.823 --> 01:12.784
undergraduate?

01:18.032 --> 01:18.913
No, I did not. Why did you go to Chicago? I went to 
Chicago because it had the only planetary

01:22.699 --> 01:29.910
astronomer in the United States and I wanted to do 
planets. That was Gerard Kuiper, and also because

01:30.346 --> 01:35.915
the physics and chemistry departments were 
extremely good. The names Enrico Fermi and Harold

01:37.157 --> 01:40.842
Urey attracted me. But what I didn't realize is 
that on showing up, I was subjecting myself to the

01:41.543 --> 01:58.530
Hutchins

01:41.543 --> 01:58.530
baccalaureate program in which they said that my 
showing up showed that I didn't know any subjects.

01:59.000 --> 02:18.205
and therefore it was up to them to tell me what to 
study, and so they had 14-year-long courses that

01:59.000 --> 02:18.205
were required for the bachelor's degree, which 
had almost nothing to do with professional

01:59.000 --> 02:18.205
pursuit of mathematics, physics, and astronomy, 
and it was the best thing that ever happened to me

01:59.000 --> 02:18.205
because I was too narrowly focused, and it 
broadened me up. You'll recall there was a little

02:18.525 --> 02:22.791
to-do about some magazine. You mentioned that 
Kuiper was the only practicing planetary

02:22.831 --> 02:28.618
astrophysicist in the 50s or whatever, and 
someone said, Why did you say that? You said,

02:30.050 --> 02:31.192
because it's true. Could you give us the detail? 
Well, I learned this from talking to other

02:34.197 --> 02:42.792
astronomers, which I did before going to, you 
know, before applying. But, you know, think about

02:44.455 --> 02:46.518
it. Who else was anything close to a full-time 
planetary astronomer in the United States? At the

02:51.076 --> 03:00.713
time, not John Strong, Robert Richardson at Mount 
Wilson. I just don't think there were any others,

03:01.695 --> 03:06.784
but there was Kuiper. This is 1951 I'm talking 
about. Darius Kuiper had just edited the

03:09.436 --> 03:36.642
atmospheres of the Earth and planets, had 
discovered CO2 on Mars, methane on Titan, was

03:09.436 --> 03:36.642
trying to understand the origin of the solar 
system, was involved in theory and observation,

03:09.436 --> 03:36.642
and was also not completely hostile to the idea of 
life elsewhere. He was doing great guns, and there

03:37.128 --> 03:41.933
was, as far as I know then or now, nobody else. Were 
you aware that, let's put it this way, at least some

03:43.215 --> 03:57.271
part of the astronomical establishment, 
anywhere from half to 99%, considered planetary

03:43.215 --> 03:57.271
astronomy a third-rate field at that time? I can't 
remember if I was truly aware of that at the time. I

04:01.936 --> 04:06.882
certainly became aware of it quickly thereafter. 
the people who I asked for advice, for example,

04:07.334 --> 04:23.702
Lyman Spitzer at Princeton, did not think 
planetary science was a third-rate field, maybe

04:07.334 --> 04:23.702
in part because Lyman had done some planetary 
science himself. He was, for example, the source

04:24.544 --> 04:32.818
of the then primary objection to the jean's 
jeffrey's view of the origin of the solar system by

04:33.389 --> 04:46.690
the close encounter of two stars and had also been 
doing work on the escape of planetary atmospheres

04:47.412 --> 04:56.140
So maybe I had to buy a sample, but in any case, by the 
time I got to Chicago and talked to some of the

04:47.412 --> 04:56.140
stellar astronomers there, it got across to me 
very strongly. If I had known about it beforehand,

04:56.520 --> 05:09.872
it wouldn't have affected me in the least, because 
I knew exactly what I was interested in, and no

04:56.520 --> 05:09.872
rational argument would have dissuaded me, much 
less an irrational argument. So what was your

05:10.592 --> 05:13.675
doctoral dissertation? My doctoral 
dissertation was called... physical studies of

05:17.045 --> 05:24.475
planets, which was very broad to encompass a bunch 
of things. The main part of it, by far, was

05:24.495 --> 05:46.866
something called the radiation balance of Venus, 
which was an attempt to show that the high

05:24.495 --> 05:46.866
microwave brightness temperature of Venus, as 
found by Cornell Mayer and others, by

05:24.495 --> 05:46.866
ground-based radio telescopes, had, as its most 
natural explanation, a massive greenhouse

05:47.234 --> 05:57.047
effect in which carbon dioxide and water vapor 
played the main role. And there were some

05:57.067 --> 06:11.766
subsidiary parts to it, one of which was work I had 
done partly with Stanley Miller on the radiation

05:57.067 --> 06:11.766
chemistry of a simulated Jovian atmosphere in 
which we... I think it's the first time anyone had

06:11.786 --> 06:17.173
done a laboratory study of... jovian atmosphere 
in which we made simple organic molecules, almost

06:17.356 --> 06:23.903
all of which have now been discovered on Jupiter. 
Who was your thesis advisor? Koepper. What was he

06:27.227 --> 06:27.867
like? That's a very complicated question. No, the 
question is very simple. It's a very complicated

06:33.493 --> 06:34.835
answer. For me, he was, as far as the science goes, 
tremendously stimulating, a source of

06:45.672 --> 06:54.862
information on absolutely everything from the 
Tisserand criterion in celestial mechanics to

06:45.672 --> 06:54.862
the lifestyles of lichens. He was the first person 
I ever saw given a fresh problem to literally do a

06:57.205 --> 07:04.933
back-of-the-envelope calculation. I mean 
literally on the back of an envelope. The power of

07:08.677 --> 07:10.279
knowing enough first principles physics to 
address a new problem just off the top of your head

07:10.765 --> 07:22.684
and see if proposed solutions came anywhere close 
was truly breathtaking to me. And this was before I

07:23.425 --> 07:27.832
had seen it in any of my physics classes. I saw it in 
Gerard's hands. And he was a strongly supportive

07:30.697 --> 07:34.022
person. of my interests, as strange as some of them 
were. I was interested in extraterrestrial life,

07:39.893 --> 07:42.195
among other things. He was temperamental. He had 
his quarrels with other scientists, but he was

07:48.501 --> 08:03.756
entirely supportive of me, including finding 
ways for me to supplement my income.

08:04.124 --> 08:09.872
And another thing which I very much appreciate is 
that he did not force a doctoral thesis on me. He let

08:10.493 --> 08:19.825
me generate my own topics, which I, especially in 
retrospect, very much appreciate.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.772
I want to skip now because we don't have very much 
time.

08:28.837 --> 08:32.342
Well, I remember when the journal Icarus first 
came out. It seemed to me it was full of mostly

08:32.845 --> 08:39.833
celestial mechanics from former East Block 
astronomers that I never heard of. And then you

08:40.754 --> 08:42.857
became editor in the early 60s. How did that 
happen? How did they talk you into it, or did you

08:46.782 --> 08:50.066
talk yourself into it? No, no, I didn't talk myself 
into it. I don't fully understand why Zdenek Kopal

08:53.369 --> 08:59.697
and A.G. Wilson... decided not to be editors 
anymore, or were asked by academic press not to be

09:00.048 --> 09:07.498
editors. I just don't know that information, and I 
never asked. But what I do know is I was asked. They

09:14.408 --> 09:18.553
had asked me to be an associate editor from the 
beginning, and I was happy to do that. That was fun.

09:19.995 --> 09:22.238
And I published a few papers in there. I did not do 
anything in the way of editorial function. And

09:26.153 --> 09:31.360
then they came to me together and asked if I would be 
interested in replacing them as editor. And I was

09:31.420 --> 09:34.725
really quite young and very flattered. It seemed 
to me to be a great thing to do, a wonderful way to

09:34.845 --> 09:39.932
find out what's happening in the field. And I had 
very definite ideas about how to improve the

09:40.012 --> 09:53.730
journal, one of which was to have referees, which, 
while not a novel idea in general, was novel for

09:40.012 --> 09:53.730
Icarus. And for some reason, which I don't know, I 
mean, I generally don't know, and it wasn't a thing

09:54.014 --> 10:02.925
that I felt comfortable asking, I don't know why 
they chose me. There was a feeling, a very strong

10:05.027 --> 10:20.005
feeling among the few people who were doing 
planetary astronomy at that time, that the

10:05.027 --> 10:20.005
Astrophysical Journal just didn't want to 
publish any astronomy, and this held for radio

10:05.027 --> 10:20.005
astronomy too, planetary astronomy. And it 
helped for radio as well. My first publication was

10:21.591 --> 10:25.515
in the Proceedings of the IRE.

10:26.997 --> 10:28.879
So there was a definite need for Icarus. How did you 
go about getting the papers? Okay, let me say, I

10:33.443 --> 10:45.655
mean, I've heard this about Apjay, but my 
experience was that, I mean, I sent a bunch of

10:33.443 --> 10:45.655
papers to Apjay in the 60s, and they were all 
refereed and accepted and There was one wild paper

10:46.377 --> 10:57.394
that Russ Walker and I sent called On the 
Detectability of Dyson Civilizations, which was

10:46.377 --> 10:57.394
also published. So I never experienced that 
hostility at Apchang. But others have mentioned

11:03.464 --> 11:08.892
it, and I can't make rhyme or reason of it. But as to 
how I solicited papers for Icarus, well, you know,

11:09.665 --> 11:22.481
there was a small number of people, and I said to 
them, look, we're doing well, we're

11:09.665 --> 11:22.481
concentrating on planetary science. Here is a 
journal in which you find only planetary science

11:22.562 --> 11:31.613
papers, not diluted by a vast array of papers on 
quite different subjects. And there are no paid

11:31.633 --> 11:34.677
charges, and We have glossy stock, and that means 
we can print nice renditions of photographs. And

11:42.150 --> 11:43.693
some papers I solicited. I said to someone, so 
you're the right person to review this subject. It

11:49.404 --> 11:52.089
needs a broad perspective. Why don't you do that 
for Icarus?

11:56.273 --> 11:57.917
But a lot of papers came unsolicited. And, you 
know, as soon as a few good papers were published,

11:58.338 --> 12:01.806
then other people noticed it. And it prospered. 
There's a sort of exponential built into it. What

12:07.659 --> 12:12.831
do you think the status of planetary astronomy is 
today among, quote, real, unquote, astronomers?

12:14.313 --> 12:20.381
Well, I think the degree of respectability has 
improved dramatically. Nevertheless, there is

12:21.142 --> 12:36.281
still the sense in many people's mind of 
respectability being directly proportional to

12:21.142 --> 12:36.281
distance or maybe to a high power of the distance of 
the astronomical object examined. And since the

12:36.942 --> 12:40.266
planets are nearby, they're considered 
disreputable. In part, this is I think due to

12:42.140 --> 12:46.231
excesses by such people as Percival Lowell. But 
it's a kind of snooty attitude, which... I think is

12:51.455 --> 12:54.558
best to simply avoid. I mean, just ignore. One 
thing I noticed is that when the government

12:57.381 --> 13:12.135
started spending large amounts of money on 
planetary science, especially sending

12:57.381 --> 13:12.135
spacecraft to the planets, the respectability of 
planetary science made a dramatic increment.

13:13.216 --> 13:18.741
While you were editor of Vickers, what fraction of 
your time did you spend on the journal? It wasn't

13:18.761 --> 13:19.662
vast. Maybe... I don't know. It's hard to 
estimate. If I were to give very broad limits, I

13:24.433 --> 13:28.539
would say between 10% and 25%, something like 
that. And it varied from month to month and year to

13:28.639 --> 13:30.882
year. I should say that at a critical time, I had the

13:32.385 --> 13:42.219
luck to have Steve Soder as assistant editor, and 
that really helped a lot. How did Icarus get to be

13:43.501 --> 13:50.031
the official journal of the Division for 
Planetary Science of the American Astronomical

13:43.501 --> 13:50.031
Society? Well, here was Icarus just being 
published by a commercial publisher, and here was

13:50.315 --> 14:01.791
DBS, which I had helped found, having no journal 
affiliated with it. And there were other

14:02.532 --> 14:07.699
institutions, professional societies that had 
their journals, lots of them. American

14:07.959 --> 14:11.985
Geophysical Union had Journal of Geophysical 
Research and so on. It was such a natural idea, and

14:12.421 --> 14:32.713
so I pushed it, and then there was a time when I was 
president of the DPS, and I had a chance to push it

14:12.421 --> 14:32.713
harder, and people saw the wisdom of it, and nobody 
was trying to force any editorial policy down

14:12.421 --> 14:32.713
people's throats. There's an appointed advisory 
board that has a lot to say about what happens, and

14:38.662 --> 14:46.471
It was just an obvious marriage to be made, and I had 
the pleasure of being the marriage broker. What do

14:48.293 --> 14:54.540
you think is the current status and the outlook for 
the near future for planetary astronomy? Up,

14:54.560 --> 14:55.841
down, hanging in there? Planetary astronomy or 
planetary science? Both. Well,

15:00.927 --> 15:08.095
you know, it depends very much on funding. And 
funding depends very much on Congress, and

15:09.020 --> 15:22.299
Congress depends very much on the health of the 
national economy and also the sense that

15:09.020 --> 15:22.299
taxpayers have about this being something worth 
spending money on. And all these items are very

15:23.701 --> 15:27.927
hard to predict.

15:30.911 --> 15:37.120
The practical question is if a bright, young, 
motivated, scientist comes to me starting

15:38.635 --> 15:45.801
graduate school and says, I want to be a planetary 
scientist, would you recommend that I do it or not?

15:47.483 --> 15:49.885
I still, by and large, recommend that they do it. 
And so that's...

15:50.626 --> 15:55.890
Well, that's true. That's absolutely right. And 
certainly the number, absolute number of jobs

15:57.352 --> 16:06.600
available today is vastly more than it was in the 
50s in any kind of astronomy. But still, if you

16:06.918 --> 16:17.012
thought the thing was headed towards some 
free-fall collapse, you wouldn't recommend that

16:06.918 --> 16:17.012
students pursue their interest there. I don't 
think we're in desperate straits, although it's

16:17.713 --> 16:31.212
very hard when you don't know about continuity of 
funding and all sorts of programs started and

16:17.713 --> 16:31.212
stopped seemingly whimsically. It's very tough, 
especially for the younger people. You know, if

16:34.737 --> 16:35.338
you have If you have tenure or you've been 
successful in research programs, you have some

16:36.078 --> 16:46.796
likelihood of continuity, but young people 
don't. And the thing I'm most worried about is not

16:46.896 --> 16:52.946
the older folks, but the really young people. 
There I'm worried that we're not preserving our

16:53.006 --> 17:01.039
options for the future as we ought. Do you think 
that planetary scientists and planetary

17:01.947 --> 17:11.598
astronomers have done a good job in selling 
themselves to the public and to the Congress? No

17:12.859 --> 17:13.920
and no. I think that planetary missions have done 
an excellent job of selling planetary science to

17:16.323 --> 17:24.592
the public and the Congress. Of course, in the 
context of the Cold War, Many people understood

17:29.302 --> 17:45.801
each planetary mission triumph as another way 
that we beat the Russians, and that put a

17:29.302 --> 17:45.801
particular skew to public appreciation. But 
despite that, I think understanding these

17:45.861 --> 17:53.470
missions for their own sake, for their true merit, 
did get through. Now that we have lots of improved

17:54.277 --> 18:11.847
visual techniques,

17:54.277 --> 18:11.847
including false color photography and

17:54.277 --> 18:11.847
virtual reality movies, in which we dive down to a 
planetary surface, we have extraordinary tools

18:12.468 --> 18:22.965
to interest the public in what we do, which I still 
think we don't use adequately enough. And I think

18:23.846 --> 18:37.648
many scientists, if the funding dried up, would 
suddenly say, oh my goodness, I wish we had spent

18:23.846 --> 18:37.648
more time on popularizing what we do with the 
general public. What impact, if any, do you think

18:39.097 --> 18:50.633
the fact that we haven't found any traces of life 
anywhere else in the solar system, and in

18:39.097 --> 18:50.633
particular not on Mars, what effect, if any, do you 
think that's had on funding?

18:54.077 --> 18:57.862
I don't think it's had any perceptible effect on 
funding. If you look at the NASA expenditures for

18:57.942 --> 19:07.315
robotic missions, you see a big blip for Viking. 
But if you subtract, which I think is attributable

19:07.852 --> 19:14.742
to the interest in the search for life, but apart 
from that, it's reasonably flat. So I don't think

19:15.643 --> 19:18.867
there was a depression after Viking. We just 
returned to where we were in any case. And I think if

19:22.693 --> 19:37.133
NASA had had the courage to follow up Viking with 
further searches for life or life-oriented

19:22.693 --> 19:37.133
understanding of the past environment of Mars, 
they could have maintained the Viking blip. This

19:38.767 --> 19:40.609
is a different sort of a question. The former 
Soviet Union had a lot of people called

19:41.410 --> 19:48.178
astronomers and space scientists and all this, 
and they really didn't do much. Do you have an

19:50.000 --> 19:51.682
opinion as to why? Yeah, because they were living 
in the former Soviet Union. I mean, you know, you

19:54.966 --> 20:05.398
can criticize some people didn't get a good 
education and there wasn't adequate peer review.

20:05.800 --> 20:16.070
especially with people who were politically 
connected, and Soviet scientists weren't

20:05.800 --> 20:16.070
willing to criticize each other in international 
forums for patriotic reasons, and all of that. But

20:16.491 --> 20:21.455
the fundamental reason, I believe, is that the 
living conditions were impossibly hard. And I was

20:22.176 --> 20:32.506
continually amazed when we go over there to see the 
circumstances in which not just any astronomers,

20:22.176 --> 20:32.506
the best astronomers were living. And I remember 
seeing the little... alcove that Shklovsky and P.

20:35.872 --> 20:45.824
Kellner and Kaplan had to share at the...

20:49.809 --> 20:52.553
Sorry, I've forgotten the Astronomical 
Institute of the University of Moscow. It's named

20:54.175 --> 20:55.296
after somebody. Sternberg. The Sternberg 
Astronomical Institute. And that was very good

20:58.260 --> 21:03.887
conditions compared to living arrangements. 
standing in line for food and all of that. It is

21:07.460 --> 21:11.704
remarkable that anything was accomplished by 
Soviet astronomers. What do you think is the best

21:12.965 --> 21:16.508
piece of work you've done so far? I tend not to try to 
pick out bests and worsts. Maybe one thing that I'm

21:22.914 --> 21:32.423
pleased about is that my interest in the search for 
life elsewhere led me to all sorts of things

21:33.247 --> 21:37.933
completely unconnected with life. In trying to 
understand the habitability of Venus, I was drawn

21:38.754 --> 21:49.106
irresistibly to the conclusion that the surface 
was far too hot for life. In trying to understand

21:49.166 --> 21:58.798
the seasonal changes on Mars, which had been 
widely attributed to the growth and seasonal

21:49.166 --> 21:58.798
decay of vegetation, led irresistibly to 
windblown dust. So I guess one thing I'm pleased

22:04.163 --> 22:17.047
about is that my interest in extraterrestrial 
life did not prevent me, in fact led me to a wide

22:04.163 --> 22:17.047
range of other subjects with quite different 
physics. Look at the difference between aeolian

22:17.068 --> 22:22.137
transport and And greenhouse radiative balance 
and search for life are quite different. But I've

22:30.047 --> 22:35.817
done a whole lot of things, and some of them I'm very 
pleased with, and others I wish I had done better

22:30.047 --> 22:35.817
on. I may have asked you this, but I'll ask again. Do 
you think planetary astronomy is part of

22:39.204 --> 22:41.087
astronomy? Sure, sure. And you might say that 
spacecraft make it somewhat non-astronomical.

22:51.110 --> 22:58.698
If you can fly to orbit, land on a world, then why 
would you spend any time peering at it through a

22:51.110 --> 22:58.698
ground-based telescope? And to a large extent, 
that's true. But there are lots of worlds we can't

23:02.702 --> 23:06.906
fly to, or can't fly to often. And we are shortly 
going, I think very likely, going to be...

23:11.763 --> 23:16.511
examining planets around other stars that we 
surely are not going to be flying to shortly. And

23:17.312 --> 23:24.503
that means that ground-based and 
near-Earth-based planetary science is going to

23:17.312 --> 23:24.503
be with us for a very long time. And that kind of 
stuff, that kind of science, is a part of

23:25.645 --> 23:29.151
astronomy. What's the role of NASA money been in 
resurrecting what was essentially a dead field?

23:37.565 --> 23:38.707
absolutely fundamental. NASA, as far as funding 
goes and other kinds of support, never mind space

23:38.747 --> 23:46.541
missions. Just on the ground-based end of things 
and the theoretical end of things and the

23:47.543 --> 23:58.101
laboratory simulation end of things has been 
absolutely essential in the renaissance of this

23:47.543 --> 23:58.101
field. And then if you add this astonishing 
capability that we now have to go to other planets

23:59.671 --> 24:06.257
and see what they're like. NASA's role is key, 
central, and historic for all the

24:06.277 --> 24:15.666
arteriosclerotic problems with NASA these days. 
What's your opinion of how NSA manages the

24:18.169 --> 24:22.293
planetary program? Do they micromanage? Do they 
do about the right thing? Again, a personal view.

24:29.759 --> 24:39.350
There's so many aspects, and it's been so variable 
over the years, it's really hard to give a one-bit

24:29.759 --> 24:39.350
yes or no answer. I would say that given the 
existing funding constraints, NASA has not been

24:41.333 --> 24:51.745
orders of magnitude too generous or too 
impecunious. But if you ask me whether it's made

24:52.426 --> 24:58.753
wrong decisions, and fail to see something which 
was tremendously promising or spend lots of money

24:59.307 --> 25:11.622
on something which was a dead end or 
scientifically not very exciting, of course

24:59.307 --> 25:11.622
that's happened. It's happened a lot, perhaps too 
much. But overall, I think for all its flaws, NASA

25:14.045 --> 25:22.395
has done a fantastic job in the support of 
planetary science.
