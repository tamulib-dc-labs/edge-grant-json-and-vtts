WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:08.342
The study is underway of what A&M should aspire to 
be. What do you think the typical cross-section

00:08.362 --> 00:17.483
attitude was of the student body at that time 
regarding women, volunteer corps, and racial

00:18.104 --> 00:19.606
integration. If we'd had a student body 
referendum. Well, I'll tell you, let me just go

00:22.930 --> 00:33.523
back and I probably can't talk on the racial issue 
because I don't think it was really even, I don't

00:22.930 --> 00:33.523
even remember it being considered or discussed. I 
do know the two areas that was very, very touching

00:34.664 --> 00:46.238
my senior year in which seemed to be the most 
discussions around the dorm or the dining hall

00:34.664 --> 00:46.238
dealt with the change in the name of the school. 
because I knew it was coming, and then letting

00:46.218 --> 00:50.283
young ladies come here. And I think everybody 
publicly, any discussions was against it, but I

00:51.064 --> 01:03.501
think if you talk one-on-one or you had buddies 
talking, it wasn't such a bad idea. But I can

01:03.581 --> 01:09.188
remember the dining hall one time when we had this 
meeting, yay maroon yay white texas state fight

01:09.674 --> 01:21.692
fight fight you know because they thought we might 
be going to change our names to that i think that

01:09.674 --> 01:21.692
just about everybody that I dealt with or anything 
I ever heard had the old saying, the old army's

01:22.415 --> 01:28.484
going to hell, you know. And I don't know that I 
remember like I did when I worked in the

01:29.085 --> 01:40.322
Commandant's office or when I came back again and 
worked in the Commandant's office where you had

01:29.085 --> 01:40.322
all this vocal

01:40.302 --> 01:55.442
just just drive you crazy as we'd say the redneck 
Aggies out there raising hell about you know alarm

01:40.302 --> 01:55.442
is changing that's good traditions are going to 
hell everything's everything's wrong and And

01:55.422 --> 02:01.112
then I found out just how strong the former 
students are, a portion of the former students

01:55.422 --> 02:01.112
are. And usually the one thing I observe later on, 
it's the person that complains about one thing,

02:02.254 --> 02:11.450
he's also going to be complaining about the next 
time something comes up. But I think that I was

02:12.152 --> 02:16.840
probably... not into the mainstream of what was 
going on because I worked intramural department

02:17.697 --> 02:28.720
for four years and I didn't, usually didn't read 
the battalion because, you know, get always get

02:29.189 --> 02:51.703
back in time for CQ or this or that but but I do know 
that most everybody felt that that that we dealt

02:29.189 --> 02:51.703
with felt like it's terrible that they're going to 
let females that was the one big big problem and I

02:29.189 --> 02:51.703
remember when I graduated the chairman of the 
board of regents who had been pretty well

02:51.953 --> 02:59.983
responsible, was giving out diplomas and there 
were two or three people saying, I hope that

02:51.953 --> 02:59.983
blankety blank doesn't give me my diploma. Was 
that Sterling Evans? No, no. That was out of a

03:02.306 --> 03:07.171
gentleman out of Fort Worth, Mr. White Peterson. 
And against him, as I mentioned earlier, you know,

03:07.332 --> 03:20.087
we can see again how wrong we were, you know, and 
thank goodness that there were people like him and

03:07.332 --> 03:20.087
General Rutter that did have the views of the 
future. in terms of ethnicity and so forth, there

03:21.113 --> 03:31.620
was some ethnic variety in the student body when 
you were a student. How did... How were Hispanics?

03:35.817 --> 03:44.369
Oh, I think there was a limited number of Hispanics 
here and they came in and they were accepted. I

03:44.489 --> 03:53.702
mean, I think everybody and probably the main 
point about coming to Texas A&M was You came in here

03:53.682 --> 03:58.087
and you were treated equally. If you were a 
freshman, it didn't make any difference whether

03:59.268 --> 04:02.952
mommy or daddy were rich. You were Fish Jones or 
Fish Smith. But what was even more important with

04:05.395 --> 04:20.331
your class, which is very important, you earned 
your respect of your fellow classmates or you lost

04:05.395 --> 04:20.331
your respect of your fellow classmates by doing 
something dumb or stupid or not being bonded or

04:05.395 --> 04:20.331
part of the team. and that's why again it changed so 
much when we had girls here because all of a sudden

04:20.783 --> 04:46.082
you don't have five guys going out to a movie 
together going out to eat together once in a while

04:20.783 --> 04:46.082
going to ball games together which did help in the 
old days bond the people together and but were you

04:20.783 --> 04:46.082
all even aware of the family income of your of your 
outfit mates? You had a general idea just based on

04:49.919 --> 04:54.928
discussions because you lived so close. You knew 
if somebody was a little rich boy or whatever, but

04:54.948 --> 05:08.053
most of the time if the guy got out there and 
participated in intramurals, for an example, or

05:08.303 --> 05:13.411
He was a sharp dresser, just as long as you were part 
of the effort. If you were going to babble-bomb an

05:13.951 --> 05:22.905
upperclassman, it was an effort, and it meant that 
all the freshmen paid the price together because

05:13.951 --> 05:22.905
you knew it was going to come. Or you did something 
which was considered good bull. You knew you were

05:27.171 --> 05:28.874
going to get in trouble. Who were, and I've got it 
phrased here, the notable campus personalities?

05:34.943 --> 05:35.644
Who were they? Well, I think at the time when I was 
here, I said back, and again, it'd be different for

05:36.755 --> 05:44.067
the different people. You know, if you were in the 
singing cadets, definitely the director would

05:44.127 --> 05:53.402
have, you know, would have been the Bob Boone type 
of person, would have been very, very important in

05:44.127 --> 05:53.402
some people's lives. I think overall,

05:53.442 --> 06:00.754
there was, I was not in engineering, but Dean 
Ranstall, was later Basic Division, was a name

06:00.734 --> 06:04.520
that you go see. If you had a problem, Mr. Gay in the 
YMCA was another person that was really, really a

06:06.423 --> 06:13.375
first-class human being. Everybody, of course, 
was scared of General Rutter, but General Rutter

06:14.176 --> 06:19.464
was respected. You know, he was respected. Did 
anybody ever play any, attempt to play any pranks

06:23.130 --> 06:27.197
on him? Only on his dog. Only on Ranger that would 
get painted up with every type of...

06:28.697 --> 06:37.111
Well, some of it would have slogans. Sometimes 
somebody would be an artist and do a picture on the

06:37.151 --> 06:40.516
dog. Just like Ranger would show up here, there, 
and everywhere. Just like we had Tripod and then,

06:45.444 --> 06:48.088
of course, Reveille. Nobody ever attended any 
Frank's present house. I don't know if they did. I

06:54.472 --> 06:54.952
never knew. I lived in the other area where his 
house was my last three years, and I remember, of

06:55.373 --> 07:02.206
course, when the house burned down. Were you here? 
Mm-hmm. Let's see. Was I not? I thought I was here.

07:10.440 --> 07:11.322
What year did it burn? I don't know. maybe maybe 
maybe i had just come back and he was living over

07:12.554 --> 07:36.334
there i'd haskell i don't know i'll tell you what i 
do know uh my junior senior year uh lived in dorm 16

07:12.554 --> 07:36.334
and and their youngest child who was quite a bit 
younger than bud being the oldest and then linda

07:12.554 --> 07:36.334
and jane and anne bobby Bobby would come to my and my 
roommate's room every afternoon he adopted us and

07:36.314 --> 07:58.609
then the maid would come down there and yell for 
Bobby and I remember sitting in church one time

07:36.314 --> 07:58.609
when the rudders were going down to the front 
second pew where they always sit and Bobby yells

07:36.314 --> 07:58.609
mommy there's buck and I wanted to crawl under but I 
remember when the rudder's house uh burned and

07:59.534 --> 08:05.584
they lived over on Lee Street and so I'd have to go 
back and look and see what year that was. What about

08:05.804 --> 08:06.826
P.L. Downs Jr.? Pinky was just of course we all at 
that time I think most of us thought that something

08:09.090 --> 08:22.251
was wrong with him and he was just this funny old 
skinny guy that looked like he was going to

08:09.090 --> 08:22.251
collapse up there when he pulled his tie off to 
throw it at Yale practice but It was quite a bit

08:22.231 --> 08:49.048
later before I think any of us ever found out what an 
outstanding individual he was and and his record

08:22.231 --> 08:49.048
and Oh, yes, everybody Lupo had a had a tremendous 
reputation because if there was a problem

08:22.231 --> 08:49.048
Especially if someone really got in problem you 
could go see Lupo and I think it was John Adams told

08:49.028 --> 09:06.615
me that, and I know Red Duke worked for Lew and John 
Adams worked for him, but I think it was John that

08:49.028 --> 09:06.615
told me that he'd pick up the mail and lots of times 
there'd be just a check, somebody paying Lew many,

08:49.028 --> 09:06.615
many years later for borrowing money from him. I 
heard Mr. Lupo say one time that he didn't think any

09:07.321 --> 09:12.770
Aggie ever had failed to pay you. He didn't 
elaborate on having kept the books that accurate

09:14.053 --> 09:17.959
or anything. For you, who were the key teachers, 
advisors, as you think about it. Right. Oh, I think

09:25.371 --> 09:26.633
it's real. I mentioned to you two or three times 
that I was involved in intramurals. I was

09:30.838 --> 09:43.094
fortunate to

09:30.838 --> 09:43.094
work with Barney Welch and Mr. Penn Berthy, and 
then the last two years, my fourth and fifth year,

09:30.838 --> 09:43.094
Chuck McCandless came down here. So with the 
intramural, that was very, very just

09:43.114 --> 09:49.583
outstanding. What did those people teach you? 
Well, I think they were just, all of them took an

09:51.500 --> 09:57.386
interest in you. And you can't imagine when you're 
down here and first you're a country boy and you're

09:57.966 --> 10:12.121
treated and then all of a sudden somebody takes 
time to just want to know about you, how you're

09:57.966 --> 10:12.121
doing and all of this. And then in the intramurals 
we had where you could be sophomore intramural

10:12.201 --> 10:20.629
manager and then junior and then senior and they 
had four seniors every year. But if you had any

10:20.609 --> 10:30.756
problems, but the most important thing I remember 
about any of them, if you ever were in their office

10:20.609 --> 10:30.756
or anything, they'd talk to you. And they didn't 
seem to be rushed. And I know I mentioned Randall. I

10:36.141 --> 10:40.067
was also in my undergraduate in rural sociology. 
Well, I had Dr. Russell, Dr. Davis,

10:40.087 --> 10:47.417
Dr. Brown, Dr. Nelson. These people were just 
outstanding human beings. A lot of them had served

10:52.404 --> 10:56.730
in World War II, but a number of them were Aggies. 
But they just took an interest in the students. And

10:59.293 --> 11:02.918
if you were doing poorly in class, they'd talk to 
you about it. How did Dan Russell describe him? He

11:08.343 --> 11:15.777
was, a lot of people didn't give him credit, the 
students, for being as outstanding as an

11:08.343 --> 11:15.777
individual as he was. You know, of course, he had 
been in Chicago in the Al Capone days and had gone to

11:15.818 --> 11:24.214
graduate school, but his He was just involved in 
everything. He got a lot of publicity, of course,

11:25.797 --> 11:35.412
from the project houses, but I think the thing I 
remember the most about him is helping students. I

11:36.314 --> 11:49.155
know I had a thought that I might want to go into 
recreational work or scout work, and his

11:36.314 --> 11:49.155
brother-in-law was in charge of the City of Dallas 
Parks and Recreation Service, but just the kind of

11:49.895 --> 11:52.723
individual you could go talk with. And there were 
certain professors. You had the outstanding

11:54.648 --> 11:59.781
professors in your arena, Ashcroft. Dr. 
Ashcroft's probably my favorite professor of all

11:59.801 --> 12:06.098
times at A&M because Although I would have a hard 
time saying Don Barker is another one. Of course, I

12:12.916 --> 12:21.454
had Chuck McCandless for a couple, and just had so 
many in the second time around in educational

12:12.916 --> 12:21.454
psychology. But I think Dr. Ashcroft was probably 
one of the most interesting professors. Probably

12:28.100 --> 12:38.245
the worst professors were the chemistry with the 
standardized exam, because you could have a good

12:28.100 --> 12:38.245
professor, but then you'd have the exam when you go 
take it, and you'd wonder, where did this come

12:28.100 --> 12:38.245
from? If you needed academic advice, where did you 
turn? We had the Basic Division, which had a good

12:42.653 --> 12:45.497
reputation here. It was kind of like General 
Studies, but it had some older men that worked

12:45.658 --> 12:49.904
there. Were there some individuals you would call 
in the Basic Division? Let's see, who would have,

12:57.695 --> 13:03.743
I'm trying to think who the names would be. Austin 
Curley was there. I had Dr. Curley in graduate

13:05.504 --> 13:13.694
school for a couple classes, and of course he's 
just a very outstanding human being. What about

13:13.714 --> 13:15.316
R.C. Potts? I had, now you're talking about Dr. 
Potts in agriculture? Yes, I got to meet Dr. Potts

13:18.860 --> 13:32.717
when I was a junior because I was going to drop out 
the end of my sophomore year and join the Marine

13:18.860 --> 13:32.717
Corps and then come back to school, and I quit going 
to class, and then my daddy decided I was coming

13:18.860 --> 13:32.717
back to school, and Only time in my life he ever said 
anything to me, I guess. And I came down, and Dr.

13:35.376 --> 13:42.664
Potts called me in and called me Mr. Henderson and 
said he was going to put me on probation. And I said,

13:42.705 --> 13:44.527
Dr. Potts, I've got to see average. He says, Mr. 
Henderson, I'm putting you on a no-cut probation

13:44.567 --> 13:48.411
for a full year. And I didn't miss a class my junior 
year. And when I came back here, teach ROTC and as

13:54.314 --> 14:01.309
assistant commandant, I sat across the table from 
him one time at a meeting and I was just saying, I

13:54.314 --> 14:01.309
wonder if he remembered. I know he remembered very 
well, but no. I think that is shining, a shining

14:04.476 --> 14:08.104
example of most of the professors here, wherever 
you were, they took an interest in the students.

14:12.833 --> 14:13.093
C.K. Esten, what an experience. Was he a good 
teacher? He was a good teacher, but, you know, if

14:18.882 --> 14:30.398
you went in there and you were kind of a country boy, 
you're about half scared of him and his language,

14:18.882 --> 14:30.398
and it's like a screaming Al Nelson, you know. I 
mean, once you got by the first couple of weeks, you

14:30.418 --> 14:34.644
understood. Yeah. Those two, Nelson and Esten, 
would have trouble today in politically correct.

14:41.462 --> 14:44.406
For more than language, too. But I guess Don Barker 
would be, if I had to say one professor that I've had

14:44.426 --> 14:54.662
experience with that was... the kind of man that 
would stay up here all night or come back up here and

14:56.667 --> 14:59.790
help you. He was probably on the cutting edge of the 
computer industry at the time, and he helped more

14:59.830 --> 15:09.179
people with their dissertations and their 
thesis. As you think back to your student days, did

15:09.780 --> 15:25.375
you ever feel you didn't get what you deserved in 
terms of grades and so forth?

15:25.979 --> 15:26.480
we knew. You pretty well got what you deserved. 
I'll always remember in Ashcraft, Dr. Ashcraft's

15:30.043 --> 15:33.867
class, I had a 91. It was the highest grade in the 
class, and I got a B. And that's back when 92 was an A,

15:37.391 --> 15:40.635
and I always thought that was terrible. And if I'd 
have just gotten on that last exam, who patented

15:41.275 --> 15:47.422
the barbed wire, I would have gotten an A. No, I 
think to answer your question that... Most of the

15:50.077 --> 16:01.233
time, I think the biggest problem, though, the 
biggest problem in my days, there was help, but you

15:50.077 --> 16:01.233
had to go look for it. And I think Texas A&M now, 
especially the Corps of Cadets over here, they

16:01.293 --> 16:13.570
emphasize over and over and over, we've got all of 
these tools available, and we've got help

16:01.293 --> 16:13.570
available, and we've got counseling. The average 
student seems to think they've got to go to Mr.

16:13.550 --> 16:20.741
Bill's the night before an exam or two nights 
before and pay all this money. But I think a lot of

16:23.004 --> 16:34.641
it, if I had had the upperclassman or somebody when 
I started off, when I started having some

16:23.004 --> 16:34.641
problems, direct me instead of me having to go 
myself. Because I was so wrapped up like most

16:35.022 --> 16:38.747
students, the core was more important than 
school. Or it was to me. And that's why I've always

16:42.071 --> 16:51.789
admired the students that come in here and they 
want to major in nuclear physics or something. And

16:51.829 --> 16:54.213
they know they've got to start off and do well.

16:56.958 --> 16:58.862
You never were in grade troubles, were you? I know, 
but I never was really what you call really, really

16:59.332 --> 17:03.679
outstanding. See, that's why I enjoyed being able 
to come back to graduate school. And then I had

17:08.207 --> 17:19.406
completed five courses, I guess, on my Ph.D. and 
had all As, but then there was just three of us in the

17:08.207 --> 17:19.406
Commandant's office, and that's when I quit going 
to graduate school. Now, when did you and your

17:20.107 --> 17:21.610
buddies study? What was your typical study? We 
were required freshman and sophomore year to

17:23.445 --> 17:27.050
study three hours a night. Did you really do it? Oh, 
yes. Well, you sat at your desk, and let me tell you,

17:28.972 --> 17:32.798
it's hard to study. It's hard to study when you've 
got the window open and it's 98 degrees, it's

17:33.278 --> 17:47.678
humid, or even if it's 88 degrees and humid, and 
you're sitting there and you and your roommate in

17:33.278 --> 17:47.678
those straight back chairs. So it was hard to 
study. The main thing is it's hard to stay awake.

17:52.150 --> 17:53.651
How did you all keep the room cool? Did you have a 
fan? The best way to keep the room cool was that you

17:55.673 --> 18:03.081
were fortunate enough to have an upperclassman 
across the hall that left their window open. We

18:04.082 --> 18:06.284
didn't have a fan freshman year, no. But if you had 
that ventilation of just going straight through,

18:06.764 --> 18:11.629
you sometimes get a little air. It just sometimes 
was miserable. And I think everybody should go

18:13.531 --> 18:21.178
over to the Hart Hall today, where it's about $600 
and something a semester, and see what it was like.

18:22.475 --> 18:27.028
During your era, Korean War was over. Were there 
any national or international events that were so

18:28.492 --> 18:36.855
striking that you remember where you were when you 
heard the news? I think going back to your

18:38.827 --> 18:49.000
statement the Korean War was over with, we had a 
large number of NCOs, and most of those NCOs had

18:38.827 --> 18:49.000
been officers. And that was always interesting 
because even though your ROTC class just met two or

18:49.801 --> 19:01.797
three times a week, those sergeants were very, 
very important. And we were shocked to find out

19:01.777 --> 19:07.881
this was a major or lieutenant colonel or 
whatever. But I think during my time, I know the one

19:13.387 --> 19:23.296
event that stands out the most in my life was I was 
second lieutenant at Fort Bragg when Kennedy was

19:13.387 --> 19:23.296
assassinated, President Kennedy. But I think

19:24.057 --> 19:32.365
if I go back and think about things that happened, 
I'd have a hard time really telling you. I can't

19:32.425 --> 19:34.727
think of any. That's why I think 9-1-1 was such a 
shock to this country. We'd been a number of years

19:38.070 --> 19:41.453
without such. that yes, you and I did watch the TV 
the night Desert Storm started. And we got the

19:46.079 --> 19:55.168
commentary there from the hotel room, but I don't 
think it is. It's not like our parents, when they

19:55.268 --> 20:07.980
had the many, many things from Roosevelt dying to 
victories in either theater or D-Day or I'm

20:09.530 --> 20:12.477
getting ready to talk about traditions now. 
Describe for you and your buddies a typical home

20:12.939 --> 20:20.057
football day or weekend. What happened when and 
what all did you all do? Well, the upperclassmen

20:23.063 --> 20:30.394
were usually pretty good about if you had a date, 
you were left alone. Of course, your date would

20:30.894 --> 20:49.341
have to go down and be on the cement benches outside 
the dorm so everybody could look out the window at

20:30.894 --> 20:49.341
the girls, but the freshmen would usually, 
starting off your freshman year, unless unless

20:49.321 --> 20:57.151
you had a blind date or a date with some sophomore or 
junior's girlfriend that was bringing one. And

20:57.611 --> 21:01.055
that usually never happened because people 
usually stayed with their classes. But midnight

21:01.656 --> 21:05.360
yell practice was always a big deal. And you'd 
still have to be back at the dorm at a certain time in

21:05.481 --> 21:11.208
most of the outfits. You know, they'd have it like 1 
o'clock. And then we'd have drill on Saturday

21:13.470 --> 21:18.056
mornings, which was football. Was it held at? And 
your day, it's held? We were at the Grove, and then I

21:21.969 --> 21:32.320
guess it, and Bo could tell you on this, but I guess 
it was our junior, it seemed like our junior or

21:21.969 --> 21:32.320
senior year it went to Kyle Field. But when it was at 
the Grove? It was wild. Oh, was it at 8 o'clock? We

21:37.686 --> 21:38.587
had it earlier. It was not the midnight yell. But we 
also had two yell practices a week, you know, like

21:40.249 --> 21:49.399
you'd rush out a chow to get over there, and it was 
a... black belt privilege to go to Yale practice,

21:50.071 --> 21:53.715
not the freshman, sophomore. A large number of the 
juniors and seniors didn't go, and probably the

21:54.716 --> 22:05.389
best typical picture of that is what you see in the 
Bear Bryant movie when you see them in there and

21:54.716 --> 22:05.389
everybody just squeezed up. And finally, because 
of safety, I would guess that was probably the

22:05.429 --> 22:11.115
reason they moved us out of the Grove. But it was 
wild. Of course, if we won the game, you know, you

22:15.400 --> 22:21.589
had the tradition of the yell practice. We 
outscored the game, I should say, and we didn't in

22:21.669 --> 22:28.760
my five years here at college, we didn't have a 
50-50 season. So we hit the Myers and Fulberg era.

22:34.689 --> 22:43.602
Now, as a fish, if you were to go down and try to grab 
the yell eaters and throw them in the pond, where

22:34.689 --> 22:43.602
did the date wait for you? That was one of those 
deals in the stands you'd say, okay, you always had

22:44.172 --> 22:57.544
to walk in wounded, never outfit, and they'd 
gather up the dates, and then you'd meet

22:44.172 --> 22:57.544
somewhere, you know, and it was kind of like in the 
dorm. Lots of times you'd gather up, because we'd

22:57.584 --> 23:05.211
march into the game, you'd gather up the gals and 
bring them to the stadium, you know, and you'd sit.

23:05.832 --> 23:11.056
I often think how those girls must have thought, 
what they must have thought. Yeah, did you? Were

23:12.252 --> 23:14.715
you, did you have a steady date with her? No, no, I 
never did. I was one of those guys that probably

23:15.676 --> 23:21.524
didn't have a dozen dates in five years here, you 
know. Did, if a guy had a first date with a young lady

23:22.104 --> 23:31.116
at a football game, did he still kiss her after? Oh, 
yes, yes, yes. And how did she, was she well aware of

23:33.278 --> 23:35.681
that? Oh, yes, everybody was well aware of that, 
you know. And would you practice that at Yale

23:38.765 --> 23:41.128
practice? I can't remember. I can't remember. Do 
you remember any important football game pranks

23:45.104 --> 23:52.890
other than the turning the armadillos loose?

23:56.954 --> 24:04.475
But the only thing I really, and it's terrible, 
that's why I have a problem talking to some of my

23:56.954 --> 24:04.475
classmates that can remember all this trivia. I 
remember, not a prank, but I do remember going to

24:05.358 --> 24:11.976
Dallas for the SMU game my junior year when it was so 
foggy in the night that Johnny Harton got killed,

24:11.956 --> 24:23.055
and the guy that had to wreck with him was set across 
from me in biology lab. And so, and he was not

24:23.817 --> 24:33.053
injured very badly at all, but of course Johnny 
Harton was killed. Pranks at football games, one

24:33.033 --> 24:49.814
of the things I always remember is when we were 
having the court trip, we'd always get briefs,

24:33.033 --> 24:49.814
start your freshman year, if they're throwing 
anything out from the tops of the buildings, you

24:33.033 --> 24:49.814
know, the back two ranks and the first rank breaks 
off and you're going, you know, and all of this. And

24:49.874 --> 24:56.442
we were just gobbled up with the dumb tail, I guess, 
you know, we really thought.

24:58.328 --> 25:13.451
There were just a lot of times we'd go to the games 
and we always remembered that the bulls were

24:58.328 --> 25:13.451
always around, so you were very careful if you did 
anything wrong. It seemed like they were always in

25:13.511 --> 25:19.100
view of you during the day or something like that. 
Among the great traditions, silver tabs. Do you by

25:25.261 --> 25:31.122
chance remember anything about your first silver 
taps and the impression it made on you? No.

25:33.277 --> 25:46.851
numerous articles and I just Can remember going 
like we always went in it and I guess the one thing I

25:33.277 --> 25:46.851
remember then It was silent. It was silent and the 
lights were out and I think of course nowadays It is

25:46.871 --> 26:00.044
still basically silent and you you you can see 
lights and you can hear people talking a little bit

25:46.871 --> 26:00.044
But it's still it's amazing. I think probably the 
most interesting thing is I I think we went even as

26:05.980 --> 26:07.442
seniors. And now, we went to Silver Taps as a 
senior. I mean, I think we all basically, of

26:12.628 --> 26:15.952
course, I think we all went. And now, Silver Taps, 
if you go the first of the year or the first couple,

26:16.072 --> 26:20.977
it's usually crowded. And then the numbers start 
dwelling. And I know I've been a number of times

26:23.140 --> 26:28.186
myself since I've been back. And usually, it's 
when you know someone or something like that is the

26:28.206 --> 26:32.030
reason you go. But the students. with the 
exception of the Corps or people that know

26:34.313 --> 26:55.584
something, I think, I don't think you have the 
turnout that you should, although I'm the first to

26:34.313 --> 26:55.584
tell you, and I've told you before, that I think the 
traditions are mainly kept and new ones come about

26:34.313 --> 26:55.584
because of the civilian girls, you know, here on 
this campus. Did you ever hear of anybody even

27:00.065 --> 27:02.867
thinking about a prank during the Silvertapes? 
No. I've never heard one. That's kind of the sacred

27:05.910 --> 27:08.893
cow I've always thought. The Silvertapes and 
Muster. Of course, we had Muster. Muster then, we

27:12.716 --> 27:16.119
had it and it was over with. Now it's turned into 
such a big, big event, which is great. When you

27:20.663 --> 27:26.388
first attended Muster, was it held out on the MFC? 
MFC lawns, if I remember right, you know. And do you

27:29.697 --> 27:37.029
have any feeling of what your first muster 
reaction was? What did you think? No, I don't. I

27:39.694 --> 27:46.345
think it was just a, to be very honest with you, I 
think it was probably just another formation and

27:39.694 --> 27:46.345
another thing that we had to go to. But I think 
somewhere along the first or second year, it

27:46.986 --> 27:53.697
became important to you, you know,

27:55.837 --> 28:00.402
And we didn't have the large number of names called 
or things like you have now, too. And now you see

28:02.204 --> 28:09.132
where Muster is really oriented towards the 
family of the deceased. And they do so much for

28:09.232 --> 28:11.815
them. And there's so much publicity. But it's like 
everything else. The student committees are so

28:15.639 --> 28:19.003
involved. And it's a year-long program. Okay, 
back on.

28:31.614 --> 28:32.175
Bonfire. How long did you and your buddies work on 
bonfire? Well we, if I remember right, we had three

28:36.202 --> 28:41.331
day holiday here during the bonfire. We went out 
and we went out to the cutting area. now there were

28:45.078 --> 28:59.577
outfits that worked the stacking area and the band 
was always over there but we always went to the

28:45.078 --> 28:59.577
cutting area and it seemed like there was might 
have been one or two other Saturdays we worked but

28:45.078 --> 28:59.577
there were three days when we were out of school it 
was just a holiday went out and worked on it, cut,

29:00.012 --> 29:07.083
and the logs were brought in, and that was just 
about it. We might have one night when they'd call

29:07.163 --> 29:20.083
us out there to stack logs, but it was just really, a 
bonfire only lasted a very, very short time, and

29:07.163 --> 29:20.083
now it turned into, recent years, it turned into a 
full year. And bonfire, in your era, was held on the

29:20.103 --> 29:22.827
drill field? Duncan. Oh, was it? Oh, it was already 
over? Okay. And what kind of stack? It was just

29:31.116 --> 29:34.400
the... One level. And I think we may have started 
going into the second level by the time I

29:35.201 --> 29:39.827
graduated. And... It would always rain out there, 
and Duncan was muddy.

29:48.819 --> 29:51.282
Did anybody ever get hurt that you remember? It was 
a junior privilege to the cutting area to swing an

29:52.173 --> 30:10.256
axe and and we didn't have all of the machinery of 
course there was always a few bulldozers and it was

29:52.173 --> 30:10.256
seemed like my freshman sophomore year the two 
years you participated in it it it was just muddy as

29:52.173 --> 30:10.256
could be. I know my junior year I was still involved 
and I've got some good pictures I've taken

30:10.937 --> 30:17.185
photography class we got good pictures of the You 
could see at least 12 or 13 groups bringing logs out

30:17.165 --> 30:24.051
because you couldn't get a vehicle in, just 
carrying them. But the worst thing was... Maybe a

30:25.973 --> 30:34.461
broken arm or something like that, but I don't 
remember any deaths or minor cuts. I just don't

30:36.082 --> 30:39.225
remember us having any accidents. And the worst 
behavior was somebody drinking a little? I don't

30:45.785 --> 30:50.230
know that we ever had any in the outfit I was in. But 
it was the night of the bonfire. There was, of

30:53.173 --> 30:55.916
course, quite a few people getting drunk. It seems 
like, if I can really remember right, my first two

30:56.237 --> 31:02.644
years bonfire, we went out there and watched it. 
Then we went back to the Darm study. It wasn't the

31:05.086 --> 31:12.655
production that it turned into once you start 
having young ladies here and young ladies

31:05.086 --> 31:12.655
involved in building. From your era, what was the 
value Oh, I think the real value
