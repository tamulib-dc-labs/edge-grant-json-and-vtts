WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:06.870
He helped his father in the paint shop at the time. 
And also, there was a, he called it a livery stable

00:07.951 --> 00:12.537
here. And Daddy said he loved horses. And he said 
that the man who had the livery stable would hire

00:16.362 --> 00:20.527
Daddy to go out. People who came to town wouldn't 
have transportation sometimes. And so they'd

00:24.733 --> 00:27.957
rent a buggy, a horse and buggy. Well, they'd hire 
Daddy to go along to see they didn't abuse the horse

00:28.137 --> 00:31.742
and buggy And he said he'd just ride all over the 
country, you know, and had a good time. Said he

00:35.703 --> 00:36.804
loved doing that. And I think that's interesting 
to me that he did that. Now, some of those things

00:39.809 --> 00:45.979
I've almost forgotten that Daddy, in the last 
years, I'd ask him about, you know. He told about

00:45.999 --> 00:55.995
how they'd go by relay, you know, they'd take some 
horses to, like, to Normandy or somewhere and then

00:45.999 --> 00:55.995
change horses and go on. And he told about that, 
too, in his lifetime. They did that. That was

01:00.359 --> 01:01.100
interesting. And I rode in a Surrey with a fringe on 
top. Yeah, oh yeah. I was at a meeting recently, and

01:05.486 --> 01:12.075
I said, I rode in a Surrey with a fringe on the top, 
and my sister said, you did not? And I said, well, I

01:12.175 --> 01:13.597
certainly did. I said, the Swinecoats had one 
across the street from us on 29th Street. She says,

01:19.045 --> 01:22.970
well, I was going to say, ever since you were born, 
we had a car. I said, but these people have a... But

01:26.448 --> 01:29.112
our cars were in our barns then. We didn't have 
garages, you know. Do you ever remember anything

01:31.335 --> 01:42.349
when you were, you know, little or anything, you 
know, father and uncle remember that was really a

01:31.335 --> 01:42.349
luxury or something that, you know, something 
uncommon? Like, let's say, you know, back then,

01:42.369 --> 01:49.559
you know, like women, it was, you know, silk or 
something like that and garments, you know,

01:42.369 --> 01:49.559
trying to get at. Something that you thought was 
really something that was a... That I thought was a

01:50.040 --> 01:54.145
luxury? Yeah. Yeah. It

01:55.473 --> 02:03.262
was something I thought of the other day. Several 
of us were talking about what we used to think were

02:04.083 --> 02:08.448
rich people, you know? Oh, yeah. And my husband 
said, well, the people that he thought were rich

02:08.849 --> 02:13.915
when he was a boy were those who ordered... He 
worked in the grocery store, and those who

02:13.935 --> 02:16.738
ordered... asparagus were the rich people. Let me 
see. We think about that. We all were laughing

02:21.962 --> 02:24.326
about who we thought were rich. He said nobody but 
rich people used to eat asparagus.

02:30.213 --> 02:35.440
What was the more wealthier people in Bryan's 
College Station here, what was their type of work?

02:36.141 --> 02:37.262
What was the difference in their? What was their 
type of income? Oh, I think most of them had

02:38.825 --> 02:43.030
property down there.

02:47.245 --> 02:50.512
Or some of them were owners of stores. And some of 
the doctors were well. The doctors here, I always

02:54.340 --> 02:57.507
thought were well off. They're famous and dressed 
well and had a lot of advantages. Did you ever hear

03:07.816 --> 03:13.943
anybody say about, you know, when the first car 
they ever saw come through dry or something like

03:07.816 --> 03:13.943
that? No. Daddy owned the second car that was ever 
in dry. Oh, really? What kind was it? But he owned it

03:17.807 --> 03:19.990
second-hand. Uh-huh. I believe it was an EMF. An 
EMF? I remember the EMF. He kept several cars, and

03:24.835 --> 03:29.341
we wished he'd get rid of them, and now I wish we had 
them. Yeah. Oh, they were marvelous. They sat way

03:31.283 --> 03:34.547
up high, and they had these little lanterns on 
them. You know, he kept them in the garage things.

03:36.942 --> 03:39.305
When he'd get a new car, he'd keep those old ones. 
Daddy liked things. He understood about things

03:41.187 --> 03:42.949
like that. We talk him out of it, you know, now. And 
he had a Flanders. I don't know if you ever heard of a

03:46.954 --> 03:48.316
Flanders. No, I sure haven't. That was a Flanders 
Roadster. Yeah. It was cute. I think it was sort of

03:52.481 --> 03:55.225
like a sports roadster, if I remember. But I 
remember those two were some of the first cars that

03:55.865 --> 03:59.910
ever came to mind. They were, I guess then they had 
gas pumps or something like that. I don't remember

04:05.410 --> 04:14.638
where we, everybody, everybody mended

04:05.410 --> 04:14.638
their own tires.

04:17.161 --> 04:20.103
Nobody, as far as I know, mended your tire for you. 
And they have, Daddy always patched his own tires.

04:22.665 --> 04:24.267
And that was real exciting. And he could do 
anything. And he didn't like, didn't mind us

04:25.648 --> 04:28.150
watching him. You know, we'd stand around and he'd 
patch this tire and he'd put this glue on it, you

04:28.170 --> 04:33.375
know, and. Then he'd blow it up and see if it worked, 
you know. Oh, men could do anything, you know,

04:37.593 --> 04:40.057
then. And they practically had to, you know, 
survive. That was interesting, though. I think.

04:46.046 --> 04:50.172
And then they put it in water to see if air was coming 
out, you know. Sure, yeah, just like we do nowadays

04:50.332 --> 04:52.796
with bicycle tires. Those things just entertain 
kids, you know, to watch that. And Mother had a

04:55.520 --> 05:01.209
washing machine that Daddy bought her one time, 
and that was the funniest thing you ever saw. It

05:01.610 --> 05:02.451
had... wooden pegs in it like the end of a 
broomstick. And you turn it around and it was lots

05:08.550 --> 05:11.553
harder work than washing by hand. And it didn't do 
any good anyway. It was a wooden tub. I remember

05:15.698 --> 05:16.499
that. And then I remember too we had, everybody had 
a cow or two. Everybody lived far enough apart. Oh

05:25.149 --> 05:25.550
really? You didn't live jam up against each other. 
And so you had a lot and where we lived We lived at the

05:31.810 --> 05:33.613
other end of Haswell. I keep moving back to Haswell 
here. And when I, later after we left this house,

05:35.996 --> 05:39.381
that house. And we had two or three lots around 
there. You know, big areas. And Daddy loved to

05:45.990 --> 05:47.773
garden. He worked in the office in the daytime at 
night. He had a beautiful garden. He'd plow by me

05:52.519 --> 05:54.522
and my wife. Was it a flower garden or more of a 
vegetable garden? Well, we had flowers in the

05:57.086 --> 05:58.768
yard. Pear trees and plum trees. Oh, I like pears. 
And we had grapes, and we had blueberries, and

06:01.612 --> 06:09.024
Daddy grew lettuce and every kind of vegetable. 
And then he grew peanuts and kept them in the barn,

06:09.044 --> 06:13.551
and the kids would go in there and get those peanuts 
out. Did a lot of people have their own gardens like

06:13.571 --> 06:16.335
that? Oh, everybody had their own garden. 
Everybody. So the grocery store just carried the

06:20.242 --> 06:23.046
main staple. I guess so, uh-huh. Everybody had 
their own garden. You remember the prices of

06:27.177 --> 06:33.004
things as compared to now, way back then, that your 
father talked about? No, I can't remember that too

06:33.905 --> 06:36.047
much. Because I know, you know, I remember my dad 
telling, my grandpa telling us about the prices

06:36.067 --> 06:41.714
and stuff. I don't have any idea what the price is. 
It's really... And I know somebody was saying what

06:44.057 --> 06:52.046
the price of bread was in relationship and what the 
size of the loaf was. Well, I can't even remember if

06:52.406 --> 06:55.590
the loaves were smaller or bigger. Mm-hmm. But I 
remember Daddy used to buy five loaves a day. Five

06:59.653 --> 07:01.757
loaves a day. I said, Daddy, it looks like that 
would have made you go broke. But they must have

07:05.083 --> 07:06.906
been smaller than that. Sure, they must have been 
pretty. And they'd be hot. We'd get them at that

07:09.251 --> 07:10.573
bakery. Yeah, uh-huh. They'd be hot. Was Brian 
mainly just centered around this one big street,

07:13.297 --> 07:32.645
you know, or was it kind of a network type, you know, 
or streets, you know, like we've been studying the

07:13.297 --> 07:32.645
different kinds of settlements, you know, they 
have linear settlements that were along a basic

07:13.297 --> 07:32.645
mode of, you know, a major mode of travel, you know, 
such as a railroad or road. Yeah, they were just

07:32.705 --> 07:37.872
main streets, but then there were always people 
scattered out between Brian and college, you

07:32.705 --> 07:37.872
know. Did they ever have a city square or anything 
like that? I don't think you're at all, Brian

07:40.769 --> 07:47.839
didn't have a city square unless the courthouse 
would have been counted one, and I don't think we

07:40.769 --> 07:47.839
ever, you know, we didn't have one. Was the 
courthouse counted right at the center of the

07:47.879 --> 07:50.523
city, though? No. It wasn't? See, downtown, 
usually the square is in the middle of the stores,

07:53.187 --> 08:00.157
and we always had the courthouse on this side. 
That's interesting, isn't it? Yeah, that is. That

08:04.303 --> 08:06.106
really is.

08:08.509 --> 08:10.472
You remember talking about different, the 
different parts of Bryan as, you know, like upper

08:10.756 --> 08:17.186
Bryan, lower Bryan, stuff like that. Was it ever 
termed like that? What do you mean by that? You

08:19.609 --> 08:29.484
know, like... Like the caste system or like the... 
Well, like, you know, I'm going into town or I'm

08:19.609 --> 08:29.484
going, you know, you're... Well, it was just all 
one town. And, like, when we lived in this house,

08:29.684 --> 08:35.613
that was the main part of town. On 29th Street. On 
the west side was the main part of town. Then it came

08:39.292 --> 08:40.654
east. Because of the highway? I don't know why. 
Well, I know Highway 6. I never have understood

08:45.439 --> 08:47.301
why, but it did. Highway 6 came through, and that 
shot everything over towards Texas Avenue.

08:54.489 --> 08:58.433
You've got me interested in this, and I ask my 
sister a lot of questions. So today I said, let's go

08:59.054 --> 09:03.979
by and see where that house was because I want to be 
sure what the address is. And she says, all right,

09:04.500 --> 09:07.223
and I'll show you the house we lived in before. You 
were born, and I said, you mean that's still

09:07.439 --> 09:09.983
standing? I said, I didn't even know it. We went by 
there, and it is beautiful. The people who have

09:14.030 --> 09:19.059
bought it have kept it up, and it's just perfect. 
That house is just gorgeous. It's way over on the

09:20.441 --> 09:28.255
west side of town, and they've got the yard 
beautiful, and they still have that gingerbread

09:20.441 --> 09:28.255
on it that's in the picture, you know what I mean? I 
don't have a picture of it, but anyway. Isn't that

09:31.199 --> 09:33.702
wonderful that somebody's kept a house like that? 
Yeah, that's... And she said, I'm going to go over

09:33.722 --> 09:37.867
there and ask them to let me see it. Because I said, 
the lady we bought this house from moved to

09:37.887 --> 09:41.051
California. She came back and we told her to come 
over and see us. And so she says, oh, she's so glad to

09:44.095 --> 09:47.519
get to come back and see us. Well, how big is your 
family? How many brothers and sisters? There were

09:50.883 --> 09:51.624
five. Five of you all? Five children. Two of them 
are dead. My two brothers are dead. They died when

09:56.049 --> 09:58.152
we were like, since 19... Sixty-nine, one brother 
in 1973. And you and your sister? Three sisters. My

10:03.867 --> 10:05.190
two sisters live here. They both live here in 
Bryan? Uh-huh. What do they do? Montgomery works

10:12.948 --> 10:20.416
for the federal government, and Ms. Hudson lost 
her husband about two years ago, and she travels.

10:22.478 --> 10:28.864
She's going to Europe next summer, and see some of 
Northern Europe. Last summer they went to Japan

10:29.084 --> 10:40.095
and several places she'd been to, but she liked 
this man that takes them, and his wife. They're

10:40.115 --> 10:41.757
just wonderful, pure guys. And then she went to the 
Middle East with them one time. And before then,

10:46.096 --> 10:52.944
she and her husband had an airstream, and they just 
traveled to Mexico and Canada with that group. Do

10:53.745 --> 11:01.253
you ever remember your father ever talking about 
the impact when A&M was opened? Did it have any type

11:01.273 --> 11:08.622
of impact on the city, on O'Brien at that time, as 
far as having a college there? I don't know. You

11:12.118 --> 11:19.229
know, when I was in high school, Daddy didn't want 
me to go with Brian Morris, but he didn't mind me

11:12.118 --> 11:19.229
going with Aggies. Isn't that funny? He was an 
Aggie, wasn't he? No, he wasn't. See, he studied

11:24.677 --> 11:27.421
law just on his own. Oh, I see. But he didn't mind my 
having to go with Aggies, but I thought that was

11:28.663 --> 11:33.970
funny. Now kids go with... You know, the Aggies 
were older than I was, but he said he just thought

11:35.365 --> 11:41.892
they were more responsible.

11:43.674 --> 11:46.638
Mostly I went with Aggies rather than... I went 
with one Bryan boy. High school boy. That's

11:52.564 --> 11:54.246
interesting. Everybody didn't have steadies 
then. You just went with everybody that asked you.

11:59.192 --> 12:01.895
That was fun then. How was the... I know it's quite 
different now when you take someone out on a date.

12:07.345 --> 12:11.111
You had to go over and meet their parents and all 
that stuff. Was it pretty conservative back then?

12:12.914 --> 12:13.315
Yes. And of course, all the Aggies were broke, and 
none of them had cars, so they were safe.

12:22.431 --> 12:23.873
You walked to the picture show. Where was the main 
theater, the picture show? It was down where it is

12:26.478 --> 12:28.862
now.

12:34.664 --> 12:40.533
It's exactly where it was, the palace. Was that the 
main... It was the main one, and then they had the

12:42.716 --> 12:48.144
Dixie and the Queen, and I don't even know what 
shows they have now. That's how much I know. Yeah,

12:50.708 --> 12:52.811
it's quite different now. I don't know whether 
they have those two shows or not, the Queen and the

12:52.831 --> 12:57.718
Dixie. See, they had, the queen used to have good 
shows, and the palace would have good shows, and

12:58.913 --> 13:17.855
the Dixie had, I don't know, maybe things kids went 
to on Saturday or something, but one of the first,

12:58.913 --> 13:17.855
the very first picture I ever saw that was in color 
was Madame Butterfly. And, you know, I believe

13:18.796 --> 13:21.759
that was hand-colored, if I remember right. That 
was years ago. Years ago. Before the red card

13:24.496 --> 13:26.280
pictures. When do you remember the first TV you 
had?

13:32.573 --> 13:34.978
I believe they got TV while we were overseas. 
Because I wouldn't have it in the house for years. I

13:39.287 --> 13:40.069
didn't want one. Why do you still want to be 
bothered? I finally... Well, I remember way back

13:44.257 --> 13:50.023
then everyone used to... We just listened to the 
news mostly. Well, I remember before they had the

13:50.323 --> 13:59.432
TV, a lot of people, the family would sit around the 
radio and listen to it. I don't know. We've always

14:00.093 --> 14:06.459
been a pretty active family and we've always been 
doing something. Besides we're either reading or

14:06.479 --> 14:12.205
studying or painting or doing something else. So 
we didn't ever listen to the radio too much. I

14:15.655 --> 14:18.599
listened to the radio during the daytime. All the 
time? No. What do you do right now? Oh. I'm sorry, I

14:23.347 --> 14:24.489
forgot. Well, what I've been doing, was why Jen 
said this, was I said,

14:24.509 --> 14:32.842
in 1973, I went to Blinn College. I decided I was 
going to go back to college. And so I went back,

14:35.105 --> 14:36.808
and... There was another woman that was about 14 
years younger than I was, and she was so glad

14:37.295 --> 14:45.295
because she says she was the oldest, and now 
somebody older than her was going. And so she said

14:45.836 --> 14:48.944
she was thrilled to death to have somebody old. 
Grandma, you know. I took English in history.

14:52.172 --> 14:52.553
English in history. I thought it was going to go on, 
but my house kept getting dirtier and dirtier. You

14:56.069 --> 14:58.693
know, I needed to get things organized. So I did 
that. Well, then I decided for about three years I

14:59.434 --> 15:09.088
was going to start studying family history and get 
it so that my son and all of them can get their hands

14:59.434 --> 15:09.088
on it. You know, that's why you and I sent you to me. 
I've been trying to get these facts in a way that...

15:17.710 --> 15:22.535
some of these young people are beginning to be 
interested, and unless somebody does it now, it's

15:17.710 --> 15:22.535
going to be too late. Was there any type of, I guess 
the only type of industry they really had was

15:22.976 --> 15:30.184
cotton here then, right? I believe so, yeah. 
That's just about all, as far as I know. I know that

15:37.152 --> 15:38.253
you know what... It just was a little, just a small 
town. I used to, I remember when we went up to

15:41.416 --> 15:44.680
Wisconsin, that's where all my family's from. 
They used to let us smoke. I have three brothers and

15:47.239 --> 15:54.009
we used to go over in the attic in my grandpa's house 
and just spend hours up in that attic looking at old

15:47.239 --> 15:54.009
stuff. When my grandfather on my mother's side 
passed away she brought back a lot of his stuff and

15:54.670 --> 16:05.065
it was a will dated 1793.

16:05.348 --> 16:08.553
a will, and it said, you know, to my first son, I 
bequeathed. You know, it was really... And, you

16:08.573 --> 16:12.659
know, they used to make family trees, too. They 
used to have these big old lists, and they'd make up

16:12.960 --> 16:15.864
a family tree, you know. Thy first son, you know, 
thus named. And it was really interesting, you

16:19.370 --> 16:22.114
know, that's why... What name was that? Was that 
Friedli? Bradfield. That was my mother's name.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.242
That's British, isn't it? Yeah, I believe so. 
Sounds kind of British. Yeah. And Friedli is

16:29.906 --> 16:31.609
German. My grandfather on my dad's side 
immigrated from Switzerland. They were real

16:36.603 --> 16:38.266
German. My dad grew up in a little town. He was born 
in a cheese factory. He was? Yeah. He grew up around

16:44.597 --> 16:46.761
cheese, butter, and milk. When he went to the 
University of Wisconsin, he studied dairy

16:47.382 --> 16:51.489
science. That's what brought my parents to 
Mexico.

16:57.307 --> 17:03.193
A man named Murchison was trying to start a dairy 
industry down in Monterrey. Well, not in

17:03.353 --> 17:04.514
Monterrey, Mexico. They lived in Tampico. And

17:05.775 --> 17:10.100
that's why they were down there. And they lived 
there for 13 years. And me and my younger brother

17:12.162 --> 17:15.445
were born there while they lived in Monterrey. And 
you pretty good speak Spanish. Yeah, uh-huh. My

17:19.529 --> 17:21.511
son loves Spanish. Right now, my mom's a Spanish 
teacher. She teaches Spanish in high school. They

17:25.875 --> 17:26.976
just left for Europe. My dad works for Summers Drug 
Stores, Rexall Drug Stores in San Antonio. They

17:33.298 --> 17:36.203
have a big drug convention in Switzerland. And 
that's where all my dad's relatives are. And he's

17:38.187 --> 17:39.730
going to see them for the very first time. And they 
just left last Monday, in fact. They're going to be

17:43.797 --> 17:46.663
gone for three weeks. Well, that's good. Yeah. I 
know a lot about my parents' background up in

17:48.893 --> 17:53.460
Wisconsin. My mom, she's a DAR. She wanted to, but 
she never had enough time to join it. But one of her

17:58.107 --> 18:02.735
ancestors was a corporal in the American 
Revolution and stuff like that. Well, my husband

18:02.755 --> 18:05.178
is from Mississippi. So while I was making a bunch 
of family trees for my family, trying to get it,

18:11.422 --> 18:14.186
Also, I'm trying to get to all my nephews and 
nieces. I'm trying to just make a little booklet

18:14.266 --> 18:21.898
for each of them, and those who want it can preserve 
it, and that way it won't be, if one house burns up,

18:14.266 --> 18:21.898
it won't all be gone. So I took my husband's family, 
and I started, I hadn't even looked at his, and I

18:22.739 --> 18:34.257
started looking at it, and I found out that two of 
his ancestors married each other, and both of

18:22.739 --> 18:34.257
their fathers were in the... Revolutionary War. 
And I said, hey, you're more elite than I am. And he

18:38.638 --> 18:40.761
says, I'm going to join the D.A.R. when we get to 
life. Because he had a daughter of one of the

18:42.303 --> 18:48.832
Revolutionary soldiers and a son. Some of his 
relatives had looked it up, but I hadn't bothered

18:48.953 --> 18:55.282
with it because until recently, I didn't have time 
to fool around with it. What kind of background did

18:55.302 --> 18:57.765
your husband come from? Oh, his father had a 
grocery store in Mississippi. And did his father

19:01.851 --> 19:04.395
come out here, or did No, my husband came through in 
1928, after he graduated from high school, and he

19:04.426 --> 19:12.954
saw A&M. He did like my grandfather's son. He saw 
A&M, he decided to go to A&M. And so I met him when he

19:19.280 --> 19:20.681
was a freshman. Yeah, all the way from 
Mississippi, I didn't even know. To Texas. And he

19:24.344 --> 19:26.186
heard about A&M in Mississippi? He heard about it, 
and he decided he'd look it over. He looked it over.

19:30.790 --> 19:31.851
He came and... So I don't know what, do they still on 
the freshman have a, I don't think they do that.

19:37.489 --> 19:40.295
They had a white band they made him wear on the 
sleeve. And so I took his white band off the last

19:41.016 --> 19:44.663
night he was a freshman. He was 18 and I was 15, I 
think. 18, huh? Oh, wow. Want me to let your dog in?

19:51.404 --> 19:52.647
He graduated real early. Want me to go ahead and let 
your dog in? No, let it go. Yeah, I didn't, you know,

19:56.616 --> 20:03.593
back then, I didn't even think A&M was that known, 
that much known about it. Well, for some reason, he

20:03.742 --> 20:07.025
liked it, and he still likes it. That's great. You 
can't say it. He doesn't want anybody sitting in

20:08.466 --> 20:10.628
against him. We laugh, and anybody comes, he takes 
them on a tour. I said they ought to make him pinky

20:14.372 --> 20:16.453
down. Have you ever heard of pinky down? Yes, I 
have. Well, my husband's dad is pinky down. He

20:21.218 --> 20:23.840
takes them all and shows them all the fat pigs. He's 
in the mechanical engineering department. Oh.

20:27.383 --> 20:30.366
But he shows them the engineering things, and he 
shows them all everything. Yeah, well, see,

20:30.386 --> 20:31.707
I'm... We're four brothers, and my oldest brother 
graduated in 72, and my other brother graduated in

20:32.412 --> 20:39.319
74, and I'll graduate next year in 76. And my other 
brother's a freshman right now. And you all went to

20:43.684 --> 20:45.546
A&M? Uh-huh. My dad went to the University of 
Wisconsin, but he feels like he's in A&M. Does he?

20:50.531 --> 20:53.935
Because all his sons have gone to A&M, and they 
really love it. Well, that's good. Your husband's

20:56.157 --> 20:59.180
grandparents, were they from around the 
Mississippi area? Let me see. What? I'll have to

21:01.910 --> 21:07.435
find out about his immediate grandparents.

21:07.575 --> 21:11.398
His mother's parents were from the town. He can't 
find one on the Mississippi. And his mother's

21:13.220 --> 21:17.543
father was a teacher there. I think he was a county 
official at times. I've forgotten. I have to go

21:21.607 --> 21:22.608
look that up. I'm going to look up his side after I 
get through with mine. But anyway, he has a lot of

21:26.191 --> 21:31.275
relatives there. Do you remember,

21:32.605 --> 21:44.445
what's his name, I can't remember his name, this 
man right here. W.H. Minkert. Minkert. Did both of

21:47.129 --> 21:49.032
his parents die? Both of them died. Both of them 
died? I think he was about 12. Oh, really? And he had

21:53.159 --> 21:54.782
a guardian appointed. This is something that 
someone told me and now there's nobody to ask. You

21:59.082 --> 22:03.768
know, like maybe Daddy would tell me something and 
somebody else, he didn't tell them that. So when I

22:03.828 --> 22:07.774
try to verify it, you know, they'll say, no, we 
didn't talk about that. I'd ask Daddy questions

22:07.854 --> 22:12.961
and different ones would, but maybe we didn't ask 
him the same questions. So, but my memory was that

22:12.981 --> 22:28.802
he

22:12.981 --> 22:28.802
decided he wasn't, I don't know if he thought he was 
mistreated or what, but anyway, bereft of what his

22:12.981 --> 22:28.802
problem was, but he just left. What kind of a name is 
that? M-I-N-K-E-R-T. We can't find anybody past

22:31.291 --> 22:35.757
his parents, you see. They show his parents in the 
Bible that he was born to these people. His

22:40.264 --> 22:41.706
father's name was W.H. Manfred II. What did his 
father do? We don't know. That's all I know about

22:45.592 --> 22:47.936
him, see, because they died. Daddy would have 
known if we had asked him. There wasn't anybody

22:51.221 --> 22:52.663
else in his family? We can't find another Nippert 
in the United States. And somebody said that they

22:56.155 --> 22:58.376
are in Holland. That we can find them in Holland. 
And he spoke Dutch. He could speak Dutch and

23:02.820 --> 23:04.101
English. And I don't know if he looks Dutch or not. I 
can't say that he does. But he does a little bit. And

23:09.986 --> 23:11.247
she's English. And she had a private school here 
about 10 years ago. Ms. W.H. Nippert did. They had

23:20.635 --> 23:22.937
in 18... She had a private school, and a lot of, some 
of the prominent people sent their children

23:23.795 --> 23:30.525
there. And I asked Daddy why people would send 
their children to her private school, and he said

23:30.725 --> 23:37.355
it was like it is now. They were getting too tough, 
you know, and they were afraid the children, there

23:37.415 --> 23:44.706
were too many things happening in public schools. 
And so she taught it in her home, and she taught it in

23:45.192 --> 23:54.903
Masonic Hall, and I guess it's the same one that's 
here now, in the bottom floor of it, and had about 25

23:45.192 --> 23:54.903
pupils. And I know, even in my lifetime, some of 
those people would say that she was a really

23:55.984 --> 24:02.431
wonderful teacher. I'm bragging on it, but 
anyway, she deserved bragging on it. And they said

24:05.435 --> 24:07.817
that she taught them just wonderful. And see, she 
taught her own children, too, and she taught music

24:08.378 --> 24:12.162
also. And I know one time I went with Daddy out to the 
cemetery, and he used to have the clearest tie. He

24:19.108 --> 24:22.271
said, my mother was the most wonderful woman in the 
world. And he never had talked about her much, so

24:23.372 --> 24:26.995
she must have been pretty wonderful. And Daddy 
said one time that he never had a recess in his life.

24:32.040 --> 24:36.364
He said, I never did get to play because Mother 
taught school and I had to do all the chores. He

24:36.744 --> 24:39.566
says, the others sloughed off, you know how some 
mothers are. And he says, and Daddy was real

24:39.767 --> 24:42.469
conscientious, you know. and he was like this 
about everything. If somebody was stuck in the

24:44.977 --> 24:52.046
mud, Daddy would go push them out, and everybody 
was stuck in the mud a long time ago, as you said back

24:44.977 --> 24:52.046
then. Daddy would go push them out, and maybe 
they'd splatter his clothes when they pushed them

24:52.066 --> 24:59.576
out, and he'd come home all splattered up, and 
Mother would say, yeah, that's just like you. They

24:59.616 --> 25:01.739
wouldn't pay for your clothes to be cleaned. Well, 
I had to help them get out of the mud, and he just was

25:02.100 --> 25:12.253
always, had somebody he was helping, some family 
one time, and our Sunday school class decided we

25:02.100 --> 25:12.253
were going to help them. take a family to help. And 
we'd help. Every Christmas, you know, you'd take

25:17.571 --> 25:21.136
somebody and you'd take them fruit and 
everything. So we got over there and when we went

25:21.196 --> 25:31.710
inside, well, I saw this lady and she said, she 
didn't recognize me at first, I guess, but she

25:21.196 --> 25:31.710
says, I don't know what we'd have done if Mr. 
Minkert hadn't been helping us. And says he's just

25:32.191 --> 25:34.414
kept us alive. Well, what Daddy would do was he'd 
try to find work for him. Was it pretty hard to find

25:38.419 --> 25:40.722
anything? Well, this was a man that was older, and 
he'd married a younger woman and had this little

25:40.938 --> 25:49.497
boy, and his health wasn't too good, but he was a 
worker. And so Daddy, if he couldn't find anything

25:49.679 --> 25:56.286
for him to do at his yard, he'd come over and have him 
work in our yard and pay him to work in our yard. You

25:56.306 --> 25:58.088
know, we don't need life. Maybe we didn't even need 
him, you know. But Daddy didn't want to hurt his

26:00.010 --> 26:01.672
pride. That's really great. And he also, one day he 
says, you know, little boy's about four or five

26:02.673 --> 26:06.897
years old. He says, I paid him. He says, that's the 
first time he ever got paid. He says, I bet he'll

26:10.341 --> 26:12.523
remember that all his life. He was like that. He 
always said, he and Mother, and Mother would fuss,

26:14.185 --> 26:17.649
but she did too. They both always had a... two, 
three families. We weren't that rich, but that was

26:20.866 --> 26:23.349
the way to go. That's nice. They were unusual 
people, really. You said you went to East

26:30.415 --> 26:33.078
Pakistan? Yeah. For aiming? My husband was, I 
guess you'd call a counterpart there to the

26:35.921 --> 26:47.692
president of the engineering college there. He 
helped him organized different courses there.

26:52.100 --> 26:55.717
And he wrote a book once over there and donated it to 
them. I typed it and he read it eight times. Didn't

26:58.630 --> 27:02.295
get any money for it. I'm a built-in secretary. 
Everybody asks me what I do. I'm a built-in

27:05.239 --> 27:06.741
secretary. I keep killing myself because I should 
have taken typing in high school. You can still

27:12.950 --> 27:14.913
take it. I just got to find the time. But boy, this 
year especially, I've had three term papers in my

27:16.194 --> 27:18.758
life. You've got to take it for about six weeks. 
That's all I need. Sometime after you get out. But

27:24.506 --> 27:25.988
it sure would have helped you in college. Oh, boy. 
Well, I might learn this summer. I'll go to summer

27:29.422 --> 27:31.084
camp for the Army. Yeah. You can teach yourself if 
you get a book. That's what my mom already bought it

27:34.167 --> 27:35.989
for me. If you just take five minutes a day. Well, 
anyway, he went over there to help. A&M had a

27:43.478 --> 27:48.003
cooperating program with them. And they sent 
somebody to the engineering college, the

27:48.283 --> 27:53.149
agricultural college, to a teacher's college. 
Let me see what else. Anyway, we were with the

27:56.815 --> 28:13.963
engineering college, and so, you know, we mostly, 
we didn't try to be a place with many people outside

27:56.815 --> 28:13.963
the college, because that kept you busy, because 
they'd invite you, you know, to the socials. Yeah,

28:13.983 --> 28:15.065
well, how long were you over there? Four years. 
Four years. And so we got to know pretty good. Did

28:21.215 --> 28:22.637
you like it over there? Privations, you never 
heard of them. I guess you heard of them if you've

28:25.426 --> 28:27.608
been in Mexico then. But they had, see, we went 
there in 54, and India and Pakistan were divided in

28:28.790 --> 28:38.261
47. So that was seven years later. And all these 
people were like the poor little old Vietnamese.

28:44.420 --> 28:47.805
They were refugees, those in East Pakistan. Most 
of them were refugees. And so there was no industry

28:49.427 --> 28:51.710
or anything. And they had come there with just the 
clothes on their back. And they were sweet people.

28:58.399 --> 29:08.153
And the man who was our chief servant, you know 
everybody has about 10 servants, the man who was

28:58.399 --> 29:08.153
our chief servant could speak five languages. Can 
you imagine that having to be a servant? He said,

29:11.457 --> 29:13.380
one time I talked to him, he says, The first time 
when I knew I had to be a servant, I hated it.

29:21.401 --> 29:27.829
And I thought, a man that brilliant

29:21.401 --> 29:27.829
hurt my feelings. But he could do anything. I just 
remembered that they had a yellow fever epidemic

29:30.692 --> 29:36.499
that came through here in the late 1890s. Maybe 
that was, when you, when I was talking to you, I

29:37.154 --> 29:43.461
thought that's what Uncle Willie died with, 
yellow fever. Because back then, yes. Willie

29:45.243 --> 29:45.823
Minkert. Mm-hmm. Daddy said he was very 
successful in this grocery store and was young.

29:50.949 --> 29:54.272
But, you know, men branched out early when they had 
to. Sure, sure. And so they would become a man and be

29:55.774 --> 30:02.301
on their own when they were real men. Oh, yeah, 
nowadays. Well, it's just people have to prepare

30:04.796 --> 30:08.522
longer. They've got changing times

30:08.622 --> 30:13.329
now. I was just thinking of that. Yeah, I thought 
that was what I thought. Then I thought, well,

30:18.717 --> 30:22.282
maybe they didn't have yellow fever, but that was 
what I thought I remembered. You died from yellow

30:22.302 --> 30:23.965
fever. I thought it was. Probably was. It was some 
epidemic. Did you ever know anything about...

30:33.095 --> 30:38.510
them using, uh, navigating on the Brazos River 
back here? You probably do, you know? I can't

30:41.478 --> 30:43.202
remember. Because they used to, uh, at one time 
they were gonna, you know, make it navigable and

30:43.222 --> 30:48.336
everything, and then right after They decided, 
they were working on it, then they had the big

30:48.687 --> 30:52.995
flood, and the Bradstown was rerouted. It took a 
different route. Well, I see, I don't know, I can't

30:55.199 --> 30:57.363
remember. And it's, you know, and you don't know, 
you can't see it until you look at aerial

30:57.643 --> 31:03.253
photographs of the Bradstown bottom.
