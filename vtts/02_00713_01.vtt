00:03.068 --> 00:10.959
This is an interview with Dr. J. George H. 
Thompson, professor emeritus of mechanical

00:03.068 --> 00:10.959
engineering at Texas A&M. Today's date is 
November 5th, 1981. Let's begin, Dr. Thompson, by

00:14.423 --> 00:17.888
you telling us something about your early years. 
Where and when were you born, and what we hear

00:18.168 --> 00:23.315
growing up your life. How do I speak? Well, just 
leave it there. Stop my fussing. I was born in

00:28.904 --> 00:34.357
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, April 11, 1911, 70 
years ago. I had a very happy childhood as I'm

00:35.300 --> 00:40.091
having a very happy retirement. I was brought up in 
an industrial city. I spent most of my time in shops

00:42.116 --> 00:46.086
when I wasn't in school. I worked in every sort of 
shop around the city. I worked in a drawing room. I

00:53.126 --> 00:54.288
worked in a machine shop. I worked in a foundry. And 
I became somewhat skilled in use of my hands in all

00:56.851 --> 01:02.820
the various shops. I worked in a tin shop. I took a 
mechanical arts course in high school and also a

01:05.489 --> 01:13.479
college preparatory course, a double course in 
high school. I then went to Penn State where I got a

01:13.499 --> 01:19.546
baccalaureate degree in mechanical engineering 
in June of 1933. Tell us about your father. What was

01:21.529 --> 01:24.212
his occupation? My father was a foundryman. He was 
the part owner and manager of a cast iron foundry.

01:31.342 --> 01:38.028
And in later years, he developed the business to 
include iron, aluminum, brass, bronze, and all

01:31.342 --> 01:38.028
sorts of metals. He would take a job, a large job, 
and he would break it up and give each foundry and

01:38.809 --> 01:49.198
each shop that portion it could do well and deliver 
the finished product, whatever it be, to the

01:38.809 --> 01:49.198
customer. Sometimes a series of castings, 
sometimes machine parts, sometimes assembled

01:49.679 --> 01:54.403
machines. And he had some 50 years experience in 
the Philadelphia region as a foundry. And I grew to

02:00.181 --> 02:07.563
learn and love machinery as a result of my contact 
with my father and all the people with whom he

02:00.181 --> 02:07.563
dealt. About six years old, I knew I was either 
going to be a preacher or a teacher. and I loved

02:11.892 --> 02:14.075
machinery. So I decided to take mechanical 
engineering, learn machine design, which I've

02:14.095 --> 02:22.165
taught ever since, and I have never regretted the 
choice. I knew I'd better be a teacher instead of a

02:23.046 --> 02:31.316
preacher because I think I'd gotten kicked out of 
the churches because I have a sense of humor that's

02:23.046 --> 02:31.316
a little flippant for a preacher. But it's been a 
good life, and I found at A&M a rewarding

02:36.513 --> 02:53.657
experience in which you feel that you seriously 
have contributed and you can respect and at the

02:36.513 --> 02:53.657
same time I found no end of love on the part of my 
colleagues and my superiors and my students and

02:36.513 --> 02:53.657
it's been a great life, period. Tell us about when 
you went to Penn State in 1933. I went in 1929, was

02:58.463 --> 03:02.689
graduated in 33.

03:06.331 --> 03:09.755
Now let's see, what sort of things would you like to 
know about Penn State? What kind of school it was?

03:11.918 --> 03:13.259
It was a wonderful school. We had about 4,000 
students at the time. It was in what might be called

03:16.664 --> 03:19.908
a crude stage. All the streets did not have lights. 
There were only four lighted blocks in the whole

03:22.611 --> 03:26.656
city and the campus combined. And in my freshman 
year, if you went out after dark, you had to carry a

03:27.737 --> 03:35.967
flashlight because that's the only way you could 
tell whether you're going to walk into a ditch.

03:36.267 --> 03:38.552
Those were the old sort of primitive days. Penn 
State is way up in the mountains, and it is now a

03:38.652 --> 03:45.408
40,000 campus, very sophisticated. But in 1929, 
it was very primitive. What city is it in? It's in

03:49.156 --> 03:52.504
its own city of college, State College, 
Pennsylvania. And the name has been changed to

03:53.092 --> 03:56.797
College Park, Pennsylvania since. Both names are 
still used. It's 38 miles from the nearest

03:58.700 --> 04:01.344
railroad station. And on cold days when the snow 
was heavy, people couldn't get over the mountain

04:01.625 --> 04:07.493
from the trains. And we would sometimes be 
isolated for a couple of days. We had a very

04:11.317 --> 04:13.780
wonderful faculty. We had an excellent college of 
engineering, and it was a very rich experience. I

04:18.886 --> 04:23.951
was a fraternity man, and I was very active in 
student affairs. I was vice president of the Penn

04:24.091 --> 04:27.856
State Christian Association in my senior year. 
And I feel that we had a very, very rich four years of

04:28.937 --> 04:38.708
student activities and academic instruction. 
How were you affected by the Depression? We were

04:42.029 --> 04:43.672
completely wiped out. My father's business went 
bankrupt. The bank in which we had our life savings

04:48.059 --> 04:54.429
went bankrupt, and the building alone in which we 
had a nest egg went bankrupt. Daddy had $50,000

04:54.449 --> 05:01.681
saved up, and the idea was that I was to go to Germany 
and get a master's or maybe a doctorate degree. We

05:02.322 --> 05:04.105
had the money in the bank. And in a matter of a couple 
of weeks, we lost every penny we had, including

05:04.304 --> 05:08.390
that. So I was transformed from the son of someone 
who had prepared financially for his son to

05:09.191 --> 05:17.724
someone who had no money. For some time each 
morning, Father and I would put a new piece of

05:18.926 --> 05:28.000
cardboard in our shoes because we had a hole in the 
soles and we couldn't afford to have them

05:18.926 --> 05:28.000
repaired. Later on we found that Woolworth had a 
little 10 cent kit with a little rubber sole and a

05:28.537 --> 05:40.255
little scraper and a little tube of cement and we'd 
put those on our shoes because we couldn't afford

05:28.537 --> 05:40.255
to take them to the shoemaker. Daddy couldn't 
afford a medical doctor so for a while he would go to

05:40.335 --> 05:45.563
a free clinic in the city. All of his business 
companions, I believe, went legally bankrupt. My

05:51.171 --> 05:52.112
father would not. He spent about 11 years paying 
his debts and finally paid everyone off. So the

05:56.379 --> 05:57.160
bank The depression hit us very hard financially, 
but it did not affect us spiritually. I think our

06:03.638 --> 06:09.806
family was as strong and probably as happy after 
the loss as before. The money really didn't matter

06:09.826 --> 06:11.629
that much. I went back to my senior year in college 
with a total of $11 cash. I got a job waiting tables,

06:17.336 --> 06:23.184
and I got no money for that, but I got all the food I 
could eat. And I got odd jobs doing carpentry work.

06:26.148 --> 06:37.942
and helping professors put on their storm doors 
for the winter and earn enough money that way to

06:26.148 --> 06:37.942
take care of my other needs, I borrowed $300 from a 
foundation to take care of my tuition and books.

06:38.763 --> 06:45.031
And I had a very lean senior year financially, but a 
very rich senior year in all other ways. So the

06:45.051 --> 06:48.475
Depression wasn't all bad for us. Did your father 
finally recover from the financial loss? He

06:51.393 --> 06:57.161
recovered, but he never again had any money ahead 
as he had had before. He recovered in the sense that

06:57.862 --> 07:04.811
he paid all his bills, and he earned enough money to 
pay his own way. And so he could take care of

07:05.672 --> 07:13.042
himself, but he never again was able to collect the 
kinds of money he had collected before. What year

07:13.062 --> 07:15.165
did he die? He was 85.

07:21.160 --> 07:25.366
I was very sickly as a child, barely surviving 
childbirth. And at approximately age 20, I seemed

07:26.287 --> 07:33.918
to take a turn, and I have grown much stronger ever 
since. And at the present time, I would say I'm in

07:34.158 --> 07:37.603
excellent health.

07:41.368 --> 07:42.209
What about your mother? What did she do to help the 
family during the Depression? She was a loving

07:46.696 --> 07:50.661
mother and wife and a good housewife. And she gave 
both father and myself great strength, wisdom,

07:51.687 --> 07:56.633
and support.

08:00.257 --> 08:06.564
After you completed a degree at Penn State in 1933, 
what did you do then? I worked for six months

08:06.584 --> 08:12.130
building a machine myself, there being no jobs 
available. Several machine shops in

08:13.351 --> 08:17.055
Philadelphia permitted me to use their 
facilities. And I made a machine which I gave to the

08:18.136 --> 08:21.340
college. And shortly thereafter, the college 
recommended me for a job. And in January of 1934, I

08:26.619 --> 08:32.786
went to work in Ludlow, Massachusetts. 
L-U-D-L-O-W. It's next to Springfield in

08:34.208 --> 08:37.051
southwestern Massachusetts. And I was a design 
engineer there for approximately four years. I

08:42.518 --> 08:47.884
designed all sorts of machinery, some for local 
and some for international use. At the end of that

08:48.286 --> 09:01.040
period, I got a professional degree of mechanical 
engineering from Penn State based on my

08:48.286 --> 09:01.040
experience, and I came down to Texas A&M in 
September 1938 to teach machine design. In later

09:02.041 --> 09:07.567
years, I got first the master's and then the Ph.D. 
from Texas A&M. I'm a registered professional

09:07.587 --> 09:13.933
engineer in the state of Texas, and I'm doing 
consulting for a major corporation today. When

09:15.075 --> 09:17.297
did you get the advanced degrees? I got the 
master's in 1950 and the doctorate in 1962. What

09:22.437 --> 09:26.203
was the subject of your dissertation research? A 
three-dimensional photoelastic study

09:26.703 --> 09:32.772
involving photoelasticity and computer 
analysis. It involved beam-on-elastic

09:33.933 --> 09:40.963
foundation theory and some other topics that 
perhaps are more technical than you need to worry

09:33.933 --> 09:40.963
about now. You've been at A&M since 1938. This is my 
44th year teaching at A&M. How did you happen to

09:48.175 --> 09:52.150
decide to come here all the way from 
Massachusetts? I wanted very much to get into

09:52.170 --> 09:56.506
teaching because I knew I wanted that for life 
work. I was engaged, but I wanted my job before I got

09:56.788 --> 09:59.839
married. I wrote between 90 and 100 letters of 
application. This was another, in 1938, was

10:03.788 --> 10:08.895
another recession of some severity. Of the 90 to 
100 letters of application, I received only one

10:09.756 --> 10:14.964
favorable answer. That was from Texas A&M. So I 
came here knowing nothing about the school,

10:17.147 --> 10:23.777
simply because it was the only place that had a job. 
Other colleges were letting professors go. We

10:26.566 --> 10:34.013
were mushrooming and ever since we have had 
prosperity at A&M to much greater measure than

10:26.566 --> 10:34.013
many, many colleges in the country. I think the two 
most important things in my life were coming to A&M

10:34.814 --> 10:39.438
and getting married. When did you get married? I 
got married in June of 1939. What about your wife's

10:42.781 --> 10:45.484
background? She came from Ludlow, Massachusetts 
where her father was town attorney and had other

10:45.504 --> 10:56.134
offices in the town and was very active in all the 
life of that town. She come from a family very

10:56.637 --> 11:02.864
active in the church work of the town. And I met her 
partly through Sunday school activity. And being

11:08.671 --> 11:11.774
a small town, we were thrown together quite a bit. 
Does she regret moving all the way from

11:12.655 --> 11:15.318
Massachusetts? Oh, no. She fell in love with 
Texas. And she especially liked the friendliness

11:17.280 --> 11:23.387
of the people here in Texas. as a Yankee yourself, 
and you found the Texans are friendly? Yes, but I

11:28.380 --> 11:31.684
wasn't a Yankee at the first. I'm a Yankee almost 
now. A little while ago, I was a damn Yankee, but

11:34.327 --> 11:50.185
when I first came here, there were two words before 
the Yankee, and I found that the people here are

11:34.327 --> 11:50.185
friendly, are friendly deep inside, and I never 
want to leave this part of the country. OK, what

11:52.831 --> 11:55.494
about your teaching career over all this time? 
Would you elaborate a little more on that? I would

11:58.978 --> 12:07.148
say that I'm a teacher who loves a subject, in my 
case, machine design, and who loves each student

11:58.978 --> 12:07.148
equally well. And I have loved the teaching. It's 
been a very rewarding experience. And I

12:12.554 --> 12:18.962
practically never find myself in a big city 
airport on a trip but that I come across a former

12:12.554 --> 12:18.962
student. And the former students are simply 
wonderful. I think I love them, and they love me,

12:22.666 --> 12:28.431
and I think I have reached some students in a modest 
way. I love them. They're wonderful people, and to

12:29.492 --> 12:36.218
share my life with these fine people has been a very 
wonderful life. Period. You've taught machine

12:38.120 --> 12:40.442
design all through this time. Yes, sir. I have 
taught many other courses, but my main course is

12:40.922 --> 12:44.745
machine design. I do a marvelous job. When did you 
become a full professor? That I cannot... tell you

12:52.568 --> 13:18.778
I don't remember but I can find no I don't I just 
don't remember oh goodness gracious this was I'd

12:52.568 --> 13:18.778
say 20 or 30 years ago no yeah I

12:52.568 --> 13:18.778
did when I was younger and now I'm glad I didn't 
because I think I'm happiest although I had a touch

12:52.568 --> 13:18.778
of administration in In the years that I had, for 
six or seven years, I had a three-month summer

13:19.805 --> 13:29.322
program sponsored by the National Science 
Foundation for talented secondary students. And

13:30.565 --> 13:36.575
then the college chose to name me the director of 
the All-University Honors Program. And I

13:37.177 --> 13:42.927
occupied that post for six or seven years until I 
retired in August of 77. And that was very

13:43.835 --> 13:45.237
rewarding. And to some little extent, that was 
administrative. At one time, I thought of such

13:48.840 --> 13:54.326
things as department heads and deans. Now I'm very 
happy that it's worked out the way it is. I've been

13:58.151 --> 14:02.415
able to meet more wonderful students, and I've had 
the time to work with the students. And I'm very

14:03.276 --> 14:06.940
grateful for the way things have worked out. What 
are some of the changes that you've seen on this

14:08.152 --> 14:13.580
campus over this 40-something year period? I 
think I see a change not on this campus alone but

14:14.261 --> 14:30.724
nationally from a primary emphasis on teaching of 
undergraduate individuals to a primary emphasis

14:14.261 --> 14:30.724
on scientific recognition on the part of the 
professors. This is national, not just A&M. I

14:33.948 --> 14:38.074
think at A&M I find an increasing The excellence of 
equipment, of facilities, far better academic

14:38.054 --> 14:48.290
training of the professors than we used to have. I 
think we probably are doing our best technical job

14:48.310 --> 14:52.697
today. The teachers are better equipped than they 
used to be academically. They have better tools to

14:57.224 --> 14:58.847
work with. They've had more training before they 
started teaching. I would say that A&M is becoming

15:03.493 --> 15:20.177
a very creditable institution, honored 
internationally, whereas 50 years ago we were

15:03.493 --> 15:20.177
known in Texas, but people did not take us 
seriously out of Texas.

15:23.735 --> 15:28.042
Have you mostly concentrated on teaching or what 
about your research activities? I've had seven

15:28.062 --> 15:33.911
years full time in industry doing machine design 
in addition to my teaching. I have done very little

15:34.873 --> 15:44.388
research because my field happens to be machine 
design where the end product is to make a piece of

15:34.873 --> 15:44.388
hardware that works. And my consulting at the 
present time is in that field. where rather than

15:48.878 --> 15:53.646
write a paper about something, I actually build 
something that works. In my opinion, it's no more

15:54.447 --> 16:00.737
worthy and no less worthy than the writing of 
papers. But it's a characteristic of my kind of

16:00.757 --> 16:14.278
engineering that you devote your attention to 
creating, building, and perfecting a total

16:00.757 --> 16:14.278
machine.

16:14.748 --> 16:19.736
engineering college began to devote so much 
attention to research and what caused this to

16:14.748 --> 16:19.736
occur?

16:24.143 --> 16:29.311
I think, did you say engineering colleges or our 
engineering college? Both. Okay. Colleges in

16:31.455 --> 16:40.249
general, colleges like MIT, Harvard, Princeton, 
University of Pennsylvania, always put

16:40.702 --> 16:45.608
engineering research on a very, very high 
priority level. A&M evidently now seeks to become

16:46.769 --> 16:54.718
recognized as what we call a first-class 
university, whatever that means. I'm not sure

16:54.798 --> 16:55.979
what that means. And such universities all put the 
publication of scholarly paper or important

16:56.640 --> 17:03.688
practical work on a high level in engineering or 
whatever the subject as increasingly important

17:03.871 --> 17:25.002
and this is good it's not all bad and this took this 
came about gradually I would say since World War II

17:03.871 --> 17:25.002
we have seen it accelerate and at the present time 
the general feeling is that we ought to become

17:25.623 --> 17:30.509
expert in our field of knowledge on a higher 
technical level than before. This is a blending of

17:31.090 --> 17:37.979
our thoughts with the international trends all 
over the world. Now the reason for this is that when

17:38.520 --> 17:47.391
you design a 747 aircraft, the consequences of 
failure are exceedingly serious. Fifty years

17:48.212 --> 17:52.778
ago, we just didn't design equipment that would 
hurt many people if it broke down. Today we design

17:54.547 --> 17:58.272
much equipment that would kill people if it breaks 
down. So we're having, all over the world, we're

17:58.812 --> 18:07.223
having to be more careful since we're going to 
higher pressures, higher temperatures, and

17:58.812 --> 18:07.223
higher speeds. It's that simple.

18:18.237 --> 18:19.879
What changes have you seen in the engineering 
program at A&M with the enrollment of women in the

18:20.129 --> 18:25.256
program? The women are increasing the academic 
quality of the program in most cases. They do their

18:34.648 --> 18:36.690
homework more regularly. They study harder. They 
make better grades. So I would say that the women,

18:40.876 --> 18:47.284
who I feel are a most wholesome and praiseworthy 
group, are contributing in increasing the

18:47.618 --> 18:54.160
academic quality of the teaching of the student 
work at A&M. The biggest liability these girls

18:55.003 --> 18:58.455
suffer is their inability to visualize spatially 
and their inability to visualize hardware. This

19:07.616 --> 19:11.722
does not in any way suggest that the women aren't 
smart. It simply says that when they were playing

19:11.842 --> 19:16.811
with dolls, boys were fixing their cars. And so the 
boys have heard what a wrench is, what a spanner is.

19:21.739 --> 19:22.620
It's a wrench. what a gear is, what a bearing is, 
what spark advance means. And the little girls at

19:27.098 --> 19:31.423
the same age never had an opportunity to learn 
those things. So when we get into serious

19:31.943 --> 19:42.716
engineering problems, you have to explain and 
draw pictures of many, many machine elements with

19:31.943 --> 19:42.716
which the girls are not familiar and the boys are. 
So I would say that the girls are wholesome. They

19:46.512 --> 20:00.644
have every quality that the boys have 
ability-wise, but that their background has not

19:46.512 --> 20:00.644
provided them with as ample a knowledge of current 
hardware and conventional terms. What about the

20:00.664 --> 20:02.469
black steelers? Are there any black steelers in 
engineering? And if so, why? I think that A&M has

20:07.758 --> 20:13.743
been particularly forward in being fair to the 
black students. We don't have time to go into many

20:14.003 --> 20:20.789
specific cases, but I feel that I'm proud of A&M's 
part in that. I've had black students in class. I

20:23.652 --> 20:30.098
had a delightful conversation with one who now is 
with General Electric and doing a fine job. And

20:31.058 --> 20:36.263
I've had some excellent ones up to whom I have not 
been able to give equally high grades. The thing

20:36.361 --> 20:50.049
holding them back now is not in any way any attitude 
or performance at A&M but simply that usually they

20:36.361 --> 20:50.049
come with an inferior background from their 
previous schools. They simply do not know their

20:50.249 --> 20:57.103
algebra as well as our people do and in graduate 
work in particular they haven't had the

20:57.556 --> 21:00.820
opportunity to have equal education. Now, as a 
people, they're just as capable as we are, and when

21:01.601 --> 21:16.819
we give them equal education, as is taking place 
today, more every day, they will excel and we'll

21:01.601 --> 21:16.819
have just as many black people succeed as white 
people. There's no question about that. It's

21:18.000 --> 21:19.362
simply a question that Many of them went through a 
period of their life where they didn't get as good

21:20.438 --> 21:29.928
education as the white people living in the same 
town. I'm proud of A&M. I think A&M has been more

21:31.309 --> 21:33.171
than fair. I don't want to go to too many cases, but I 
remember one case of a black boy who acted

21:34.072 --> 21:41.000
strangely. And I finally had pinned him down. And 
it seemed that Pytos Sigma had not taken him in. And

21:46.105 --> 21:48.167
he felt he was discriminated against. We found it 
had nothing to do with his color, but he had come

21:48.772 --> 21:57.976
from Lamar, and somehow the big computer had not 
credited him with the credit hours he transferred

21:48.772 --> 21:57.976
from Lamar. This happens every now and then, black 
or white. And so on the eligibility list, his name

22:01.606 --> 22:04.975
never appeared. The instant I pointed this out to 
the Pythos Sigma officers, they held a special

22:05.191 --> 22:15.103
meeting, they elected in membership, and they 
initiated him within, I think, a week or so later.

22:15.824 --> 22:18.407
And so we can cite many cases. I'm proud of A&M. I 
think we have welcomed the black people, not

22:19.568 --> 22:25.055
because they're black, but just because they're 
people. And I think we have been very fair. I'm real

22:28.664 --> 22:30.747
proud of the way we're going. I think as soon as 
these people get the training necessary, that

22:30.787 --> 22:43.001
they'll find in A&M a place to do serious work 
without any regard to race. Are you involved in

22:43.021 --> 22:45.825
teaching graduates and undergraduates? No 
longer. Since the day I retired, I was removed from

22:46.446 --> 22:50.811
the graduate faculty. Because after 65, you're 
senile and you no longer are capable of such

22:50.831 --> 22:57.439
advanced work. I have had Ph.D. students and 
master's students in my earlier years, and some of

22:58.516 --> 23:05.002
them are doing beautifully today. Well, you're 
younger than the present. Sure, sure.

23:14.291 --> 23:26.143
Would you recommend that a bachelor's degree 
holder in mechanical engineering pursue

23:14.291 --> 23:26.143
graduate studies today if their goal were to work 
in the industry, or would you recommend that they

23:14.291 --> 23:26.143
just work? I think it would be inappropriate to 
make a blanket statement. That's something like,

23:32.086 --> 23:36.155
do people like apple pie? Some people do, some do 
not. Now, specifically, if they go with

23:38.019 --> 23:44.191
Westinghouse, say, Westinghouse would rather 
have them not have even a master's. They'd like to

23:44.251 --> 23:47.558
have them go and get a baccalaureate degree only. 
And then I'm thinking the South Philadelphia

23:48.145 --> 23:50.748
works. And then spend about a semester or so 
getting their place in the company. Then the

23:57.718 --> 24:05.588
company will help them financially and in other 
ways to blend a master's program into their work at

23:57.718 --> 24:05.588
Westinghouse. This way, the company can afford to 
very substantially assist them. And they, in

24:10.434 --> 24:16.903
turn, can take courses so their master's program 
they take at, say, University of Pennsylvania at

24:10.434 --> 24:16.903
night will tie in with the work they're doing a day 
at the plant. And they'll come out with a very rich

24:21.218 --> 24:24.649
master's program. There are a number of companies 
who like to do that. They like to have them

24:27.319 --> 24:32.528
integrate their master's program with the work at 
the plant. Westinghouse in Pittsburgh and other

24:32.548 --> 24:47.312
companies I know of also will substantially 
contribute to the PhD program if you will

24:32.548 --> 24:47.312
integrate it so there's a possibility that you 
might bring your PhD training back to the company

24:32.548 --> 24:47.312
later. And they expect that a few will come and many 
won't come. But I'd say that it depends on the

24:51.613 --> 24:56.140
individual case. I know a company in Houston that 
doesn't want you unless you have a PhD. And I know

25:01.106 --> 25:05.232
other companies that can't use you as well unless 
you have only the baccalaureate. They'd like to

25:05.252 --> 25:09.037
have a hand in your training. How do you think the 
mechanical engineering program at A&M compares

25:09.057 --> 25:14.565
with such programs at other universities? Well, 
there again, you've asked in a short interview a

25:14.815 --> 25:23.825
20-hour discussion, because every college is 
quite different. I would say that the master's

25:24.826 --> 25:36.879
program at A&M, as it was when I retired when I was 
acquainted with it, was quite a superior program

25:24.826 --> 25:36.879
and represented one of the better schools. I would 
say that as of the day I retired that our PhD program

25:42.946 --> 25:50.602
did not have the faculty, the equipment, or the 
ongoing research to be as rewarding to the student

25:42.946 --> 25:50.602
as MIT or Stanford. I think that we are growing, and 
with the passage of time, I think we will grow into

25:52.065 --> 26:00.803
being a very fine graduate school in engineering. 
MIT and Stanford and certain of those schools have

26:01.897 --> 26:14.128
a little advantage in that they have millions and 
millions of dollars of equipment, staff, and

26:01.897 --> 26:14.128
ongoing research. And I believe that we are going 
to be just as good as those schools in time.

26:29.962 --> 26:31.684
Could you discuss any changes in the

26:35.242 --> 26:36.103
Oh, yes, yes. The students know more book learning 
today than they did 40 years ago. The students do

26:43.090 --> 26:50.477
not possess the common sense nor the personal 
resourcefulness that their predecessors knew.

26:51.438 --> 26:52.539
Now, this is simple. 40, 50 years ago, a boy in Texas 
had to be careful to not be bitten by a rattlesnake.

26:57.605 --> 27:05.012
If he lived in West Texas, he had many adventures in 
his daily life that involved danger. Today, we're

27:05.600 --> 27:08.384
getting concrete roads everywhere. We're having 
policemen everywhere. I remember when there were

27:10.046 --> 27:12.970
no policemen in College Station. I went to the 
district judge to ask him what to do, and he said,

27:12.990 --> 27:17.416
get a Colt 38. And that's a little different than 
the attitude today. So in the old days, from

27:21.782 --> 27:29.413
childhood, a boy in Texas learned to rely upon his 
wits and keep his eyes open against danger. Today

27:30.288 --> 27:36.539
we're becoming more cultured, more civilized, 
subject to many, many more rules and regulations.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.244
People look out for us more. High schools today 
look out for the kids a lot more than they did 40

27:39.264 --> 27:44.333
years ago. That means that the kids are getting 
better academic training, but they're not as

27:45.094 --> 27:55.452
resourceful, they're not as tough in themselves 
because they don't have to fend for themselves

27:45.094 --> 27:55.452
quite as much. These people today will be just as 
successful as their predecessors, but they're

27:56.697 --> 28:04.327
going to get their capabilities in a different 
sequence. They're going to get their jolts after

28:05.148 --> 28:07.010
college. The other kids had quite a few jolts 
before they came. Has there been any period of

28:10.875 --> 28:19.906
time, any particular year, that the quality of the 
students that you were involved with was superior

28:10.875 --> 28:19.906
to those above all of the others? Oh, yes. The first 
couple of groups of combat veterans who came back

28:25.975 --> 28:29.860
were tough, eager, worked very hard. I remember 
one boy in particular who had flown a hundred

28:31.042 --> 28:35.849
combat missions. He would sit on the front row, 
McGuire was his last name, and he would listen. I

28:43.520 --> 28:45.482
never saw him take a note. And I believe two months 
later he could recite word for word everything I

28:45.502 --> 28:50.970
said. He wouldn't have been able to survive 100 
combat missions if he hadn't developed the

28:51.355 --> 29:00.208
capacity for tremendous observation and memory. 
And he remembered the dangers and was attentive to

29:01.089 --> 29:04.214
them. And in class, he made A every time. Because 
those first groups after the combat, they and some

29:07.659 --> 29:16.091
who didn't come back paid heavily for their 
learning. The only way they got back alive was to

29:16.131 --> 29:18.595
become alert. And when they come back, they were 
mature, they were alert, and they were aware that

29:19.132 --> 29:24.479
they lost a couple of years. They were great. They 
were great. They weren't any better individuals

29:27.704 --> 29:35.735
than students today, but the students today 
haven't had such a painful price to pay to get

29:27.704 --> 29:35.735
maturity fast. Have there been any specific 
instances that you can cite in other cases in which

29:37.137 --> 29:48.413
students on an individual basis show great talent 
or resourcefulness that you Oh, yes. I don't want

29:50.461 --> 29:54.827
to have to pull names out of the hat today. Toppy 
Pierce was one, but we have had a number of cases of

29:55.548 --> 30:04.160
extremely brilliant students. Carl, oh, fudge, 
Carl, oh, I can't think of his last name now. Oh,

30:13.857 --> 30:19.104
he's now just doing tremendously with General 
Dynamics in Fort Worth. He is in charge of all

30:19.865 --> 30:25.573
automatic controls on the modern airplanes in 
Fort Worth. He's got a tremendous job. He got a

30:27.756 --> 30:37.649
recognition as the outstanding master's student 
when I was his master's chairman, and later he won a

30:27.756 --> 30:37.649
prize as the outstanding doctoral student at 
Texas A&M. And Carl has justified that. He has gone

30:40.891 --> 30:45.377
right up the ladder, and he's making major 
contributions today. Yes, I don't know whether

30:46.679 --> 30:49.222
I've answered your question. I haven't given you 
enough details, but we have had some very, very

30:49.262 --> 30:57.934
unusual students and students who have 
contributed much to their profession. Have there

30:57.994 --> 31:07.607
been any that you've been associated with who 
overcame great handicaps from poor family

30:57.994 --> 31:07.607
backgrounds and so forth? Yes, there was a black 
boy, and I'm not going to mention his name. I think

31:12.523 --> 31:13.605
it would be improper. Because of his race and 
because of the low income level of his family and

31:15.587 --> 31:31.806
the kind of clothes he wore, he was arrested going 
through one of our modern cities, one of our big

31:15.587 --> 31:31.806
cities in Texas, simply because he looked out of 
place in the nice neighborhood. And this was an

31:32.579 --> 31:38.328
improper action on the part of the police, I 
believe, the way they arrested him. But

31:38.388 --> 31:42.374
nevertheless, he came to A&M with a chip on his 
shoulder. And he was clearly of a minority. He had

31:45.358 --> 31:50.265
much against him, mental attitude, everything. 
And we worked on that boy. And we challenged him. I

31:53.851 --> 31:55.713
remember several ways we challenged him. We 
turned him around. And he became impressed with

31:58.887 --> 32:01.471
our set of values. He's with a major corporation 
today. He has a nice family. He's going right up the

32:06.219 --> 32:07.561
ladder. He's a complete success. He overcome not 
only the lack of money, the lack of social graces,

32:09.023 --> 32:17.537
but he overcome his bad attitudes. And I'm proud 
again, I'm very proud of A&M. This was one of many

32:21.218 --> 32:31.367
boys that A&M turned around because we have given 
many students a good, what I'm proud to call,

32:21.218 --> 32:31.367
American set of values. They raise good families, 
they're good clean living people, and they

32:31.608 --> 32:40.816
contribute much to the world about them.

32:40.876 --> 32:44.339
I remember another boy that came back with lost an 
arm at Okinawa. This isn't what you asked me, but

32:44.380 --> 32:47.102
it's another case. And I remember that boy very 
well. He had every reason to be a handicap. And what

32:53.597 --> 32:59.466
happened there, it was critical that he not whine 
or complain. And we got another student who had

33:00.207 --> 33:06.677
lost the same arm in Austria and got them in a room 
together. And I couldn't speak to the boy who lost

33:07.636 --> 33:20.034
his arm because I didn't lose my arm, but the other 
boy who lost his arm could, and I could hear through

33:07.636 --> 33:20.034
the door some unprintable words, well, you 
so-and-so, don't you have guts enough to take care

33:07.636 --> 33:20.034
of your problems? And that changed this boy's 
life, and this happened at A&M. And the boy who was

33:24.901 --> 33:29.067
just wavering decided he better be a man. I graded 
him just as harshly for four drawings as if he'd had

33:29.707 --> 33:34.594
two arms. I didn't relent a bit. And so he got 
toughened up to face the world as it was, as he was.

33:40.597 --> 33:43.343
And he went into industry and was a good success. 
A&M has contributed so much that's wholesome and

33:44.326 --> 33:48.254
good to many people. I hope we keep that strength 
that's A&M. And I think we have a greater measure of

33:50.840 --> 33:54.248
that strength in many, many schools. What about 
the rivalry between the University of Texas at

33:56.135 --> 33:59.723
Austin and A&M? What do you have to comment about 
that? Yes, I think I have a delightful true story on

34:01.508 --> 34:04.595
that. I had a small part in the forming of a society 
here called Pito Sigma, a branch of a National

34:05.377 --> 34:11.511
Honor Society. And I told our boys who were 
interested in forming our society that I was going

34:12.419 --> 34:22.193
over to Austin to see if their chapter would help us 
get started. And I remember vividly one of our boys

34:22.834 --> 34:29.123
said, well, sir, don't drive over there with a 
college station license plate. They'll throw

34:29.164 --> 34:31.787
bricks at you, which was so silly. In other words, 
our undergraduates really had a rivalry that was

34:32.048 --> 34:36.334
almost unwholesome. I went over there, and the 
first thing their boys said when I said what I was

34:36.854 --> 34:49.736
there for, one boy raised his hand and was 
recognized by the chair and said, Sir, I wish that

34:36.854 --> 34:49.736
we would make it unanimous to support Texas A&M. 
The Aggies are very fine people, and I, for one,

34:49.796 --> 34:55.565
would be proud to have them in our honor society. 
And they even went so far as to elect all our

34:56.307 --> 35:03.098
candidates, so if we didn't get our charter, they 
would elect them. Through their group, they would

35:03.601 --> 35:07.607
elect them into Paito Sigma. And the University of 
Texas at Austin staff and student body alike just

35:08.248 --> 35:14.817
went out of their way to help us. Now, our students 
didn't understand it at the time, but I think later

35:15.398 --> 35:25.092
when they reflected on it, they found that there is 
a normal, wholesome rivalry which I hope never

35:15.398 --> 35:25.092
subsides. But beyond that, there is a camaraderie 
that says we are all one.

35:37.334 --> 35:42.501
What are some of your observations about the rapid 
growth of the university in the last 43 years? When

35:42.521 --> 35:44.644
did this growth start? This started as far as I was 
concerned in 1938 because the reason I got my job

35:46.166 --> 35:59.764
here was that when other colleges over the nation 
were actually letting professors go because

35:46.166 --> 35:59.764
they're Their enrollment had dwindled. We had so 
many new students here that we took on seven new

36:02.268 --> 36:09.077
instructors in mechanical engineering alone in 
September of 1938. We were mushrooming. We were a

36:11.860 --> 36:14.824
very small school then, but we were rapidly 
increasing. And I suspect that we have grown more

36:15.705 --> 36:20.371
rapidly than many other colleges. We just never 
seemed to stop. Of course, there was a time in World

36:23.195 --> 36:28.722
War II when they just took practically every boy on 
the campus into the Army. Pardon me, but that's not

36:29.309 --> 36:32.412
an ordinary circumstance. I don't really know why 
we have such an increase in enrollment. It may be

36:38.657 --> 36:46.044
that so many people of high caliber are moving down 
here to the Sun Belt that their children want to go

36:38.657 --> 36:46.044
to college. It may be, and it could well be, that 
they respect what students get here. I don't know

36:50.308 --> 36:50.949
that. I really think, even though I'm one of the 
staff, that we give a more rigorous course here

36:51.649 --> 36:58.135
than many engineering colleges. And I do know that 
many companies pay more for an Aggie than they

36:58.756 --> 37:04.264
would for many other schools. And I also know that 
it's harder to get great points here than at some of

37:04.985 --> 37:09.132
the other schools. I would say that Rice, Austin, 
and A&M are each an excellent school, each has a

37:10.494 --> 37:22.452
slightly different end desire, and that all three 
are worthy of greatest respect.

37:28.760 --> 37:48.660
I have been

37:28.760 --> 37:48.660
too far removed from that level of activity to make 
any intelligent comment. I'm not trying to get out

37:48.700 --> 37:50.122
of commenting. It's just that that's rather far 
removed from a classroom teacher.

37:58.240 --> 38:05.452
Do you have any other amusing stories to tell about 
former students or instances that have occurred

37:58.240 --> 38:05.452
here over this long period of time? Well, I guess it 
was amusing. Yes, I guess we could have several.

38:16.567 --> 38:24.202
I think I'd better not get these down on tape, but 
there were some funny things, including the time

38:16.567 --> 38:24.202
when we all came in 1938. Professor Berryman and I 
each had one suit with two pair of pants. We were

38:28.931 --> 38:32.398
poor then, very poor. He had his one pair of pants 
and his coat and vest in at the cleaner. He was in

38:37.430 --> 38:41.855
taking a shower, so I hid his only other pair of 
pants under his mattress. And I come to class and

38:42.316 --> 38:43.798
forgot. So Professor Berryman couldn't find his 
pants, so he called the department to tell the

38:44.438 --> 38:52.928
secretary that he couldn't come to class because 
he couldn't find his pants. And she being a girl, he

38:52.948 --> 38:56.612
was embarrassed and hung up. So he called a few 
minutes later, and Professor Crawford, who was

38:56.933 --> 39:01.558
then head of the department... immediately said, 
Mr. Berryman, just hold the line and I'll ask Mr.

39:01.758 --> 39:07.867
Thompson where your trousers are. Now, why he 
thought of me, I'll never know, but he came over and

39:07.907 --> 39:16.761
knocked at my door and he said, Mr. Thompson, have 
you taken Mr. Berryman's trousers? And I said,

39:17.142 --> 39:18.524
yes, sir. They're under the mattress, sir, in his 
room. And he said, thank you, Mr. Thompson. I

39:23.532 --> 39:26.076
thought I might as well buy a ticket back to 
Pennsylvania. I'd been here about a month and I was

39:26.096 --> 39:28.980
already in trouble. And there were several other 
little incidents that happened like that that

39:29.618 --> 39:36.326
sound pretty silly, but they did happen. Isn't

39:37.167 --> 39:42.434
he delightful? Yes,

39:44.076 --> 39:50.243
several other things have happened. I think old 
Jelly Belly was the fondest term with which I am

39:51.016 --> 39:56.043
referred.

39:59.187 --> 40:00.348
We have a lot of fun. We have had an awful lot of fun. I 
think usually when the boys play a trick on me, I

40:02.151 --> 40:06.016
laugh as hard as they do. I think it's fun. There 
were a number of, I think before we go, I'd like to

40:08.880 --> 40:15.268
tell something that wasn't funny, but it's 
touching. The president of Pytos Sigma had been in

40:16.210 --> 40:19.654
the army one year. He'd been in the army, and his 
tummy was pretty well damaged. And he collapsed

40:24.939 --> 40:29.884
one day on his way home to near Temple, Texas, where 
they lived. He and his wife come from there. And she

40:32.006 --> 40:38.953
took him to Scott and White immediately, and they 
found that Morris was a pretty sick boy and he

40:32.006 --> 40:38.953
needed some blood. So within two or three days came 
a Saturday, and two carload of Aggies went up

40:39.774 --> 40:45.660
immediately to give blood for Mars. The promise 
with which they did it and the sincerity with which

40:48.642 --> 40:55.553
they did it almost would bring tears. We have 
something here at A&M. We have a spirit of

40:59.980 --> 41:02.885
brotherhood that we don't talk about. Aggies 
think it's not manly to say nice things, but our

41:03.546 --> 41:09.455
hearts are very warm. I've seen many, many 
instances where people did things for their

41:13.568 --> 41:15.270
buddies. And I'm proud of that aspect also of our 
fine school. This is a great school. It's not an

41:21.155 --> 41:24.518
ordinary school. Was there any other thing you 
need to say before we close? No, I've enjoyed

41:27.300 --> 41:28.862
talking with you. I would say that anybody that's 
had the privilege of spending a lifetime at A&M is

41:29.782 --> 41:36.869
far richer for the experience. And I think, again, 
A&M is a wonderful place to work, partly because

41:36.889 --> 41:42.934
it's fun. but more because you seriously respect 
yourself for being a part of this kind of a serious

41:43.690 --> 41:49.745
environment. Period. Thank you very much. Thank 
you. And thank you very much for postponing it from

41:53.735 --> 41:56.822
Tuesday.
