WEBVTT

00:03.153 --> 00:14.744
If we would, at the beginning, Mr. Davis, tell us 
something about your early life, including the

00:03.153 --> 00:14.744
names of your parents, the dates and places of 
their birth and death. You know, I don't know.

00:17.988 --> 00:25.135
Well, my dad was born in North Alabama, and my 
mother, I believe, came from Mississippi. My

00:25.996 --> 00:28.578
mother died in 1918. My dad and I died about 63. I 
guess I know it. Okay, and where were you born then?

00:35.627 --> 00:40.772
I was really born at McGregor, just west of Waco 
there in 1900. 1900. And where did you move to after

00:41.573 --> 00:44.736
that? We moved to La Mesa in 1906, February 1906. At 
that time, there were five children in the family.

00:55.907 --> 00:59.451
We moved in a room with my uncle. who was living east 
of La Mesa on a farm in a half dugout. So they was, and

01:07.268 --> 01:18.421
he had five children in his family, so there's 14 of 
us that stayed in that one-room half dugout for

01:07.268 --> 01:18.421
several months. How did you make that move? We made 
the move by coming out of what we called the

01:20.324 --> 01:25.810
immigrant car to Big Springs. from McGregor to Big 
Springs, and then of course we came in a covered

01:26.617 --> 01:33.265
wagon or freight wagon from Big Springs to La Mesa. 
And the immigrant car was on the train? Yes. Which

01:36.750 --> 01:37.671
would that have been? 2P. Texas and Pacific. And so 
did you attend schools then in La Mesa? No, I

01:47.583 --> 01:49.306
attended school. In fact, the first year that we 
went out here in 1906, there were no schools, no

01:49.506 --> 01:55.273
rural schools at all. It was long about 1978. They 
put a one-room school out called the Key School. It

02:02.648 --> 02:05.532
was on Jim Key's land, so it was called the Key 
School. The only school east of La Mesa. So we kids

02:08.615 --> 02:13.060
attended a one-room school there for some years. 
Later we moved to the McCarty community, which was

02:13.861 --> 02:18.746
a little near La Mesa. But we didn't go to La Mesa. We 
had our country, our rural schools. And did you go

02:24.127 --> 02:26.850
there for how many years? Well, I went there. The 
trouble is, we had to work for a living. You know, I

02:31.995 --> 02:38.141
didn't know you'd go to school at Christmas until I 
was 21 years old. And I'd come up to Lubbock and stay

02:38.161 --> 02:44.306
with my uncle, and I had to do that, you know, 
because I was busy at home. There got to be ten of us

02:44.346 --> 02:51.113
children in the family,

02:44.346 --> 02:51.113
compared to small farmers. I limped to that, so we 
children had to work. So after the crops were all

02:56.576 --> 02:59.339
in, then you could go to school? Then we'd go to 
school, which would usually be after Christmas.

03:02.743 --> 03:04.986
And then you'd go until what time then in the 
spring? Well, we'd go until about April or May in

03:05.307 --> 03:10.653
the spring. Then you'd go back to the farm? We'd go 
to the farm. We was out there planting cotton,

03:13.757 --> 03:18.383
hoeing cotton, chopping cotton. What were your 
principal crops on your farm then? Cotton and corn

03:22.128 --> 03:25.152
to start with. But we found out that the dry summers 
was not good for growing corn. That's when I first

03:32.642 --> 03:36.928
became acquainted with the A&M services. They 
introduced milo, or maize as we called it. Then it

03:40.652 --> 03:44.117
would stand a drought and still make grain. Then 
pretty soon after that, the Experiment Station

03:44.941 --> 03:57.833
here at Lubbock introduced Sudan grass, which was 
a good grass for cattle and all, when the grass out

03:44.941 --> 03:57.833
on the pastures would dry up. So that was my first 
introduction to Texas A&M, took to the Experiment

03:58.714 --> 04:12.467
Station, and I would say, without any question at 
all, it turned this country out here from an

04:13.021 --> 04:26.359
in-and-out farming country to a continuous 
farming country because we could depend on that

04:13.021 --> 04:26.359
maize to make, and that would feed our horses and 
our mules. It was all done by horsepower. By

04:30.024 --> 04:35.292
in-and-out, you mean people coming in and moving 
out because they failed? They dried out, and they

04:35.652 --> 04:39.317
had no feed to feed their horses. They would move 
downstate. and so forth, we stayed with it. But

04:45.672 --> 04:47.334
we'd just come and go. In fact, where we lived out 
east of Mesa, about 10 or 12 miles, we lived right at

04:47.354 --> 04:56.344
the crossroad on the north and south traffic. And 
the east and west is just wagon roads. And you could

05:01.169 --> 05:04.432
see wagons any time that you wanted to look out. And 
generally, on the dry years, they were going east.

05:08.897 --> 05:11.580
On the better years, they were coming west. But 
then after the introduction of sorghum or Milo

05:12.353 --> 05:29.100
maize, there was less of this in and out and more of a 
steady

05:12.353 --> 05:29.100
same people staying here. That's right. People 
began to be able to each year growing up grain to

05:29.841 --> 05:38.175
feed their horses and cattle. So the grain then 
became the subsistence crop and the cotton the

05:38.813 --> 05:45.664
money crop? That's right. You

05:47.267 --> 05:55.901
then finished high school at Lubbock, did you? I 
finished high school at Lubbock in 23. I spent two

05:58.024 --> 06:01.530
years, junior and senior year. What activities 
were you involved in there that were, say, of an

06:02.067 --> 06:07.272
agricultural nature? Well, I belonged to the 
vocational agriculture class here, but Mr. Ray

06:07.292 --> 06:17.061
Mowery, who had just finished A&M, came out here in 
21. Incidentally, he was the first vocational

06:17.202 --> 06:23.388
agriculture teacher on the South Plains in 21. So 
through a two-year study and work with Mr. Mowery,

06:30.029 --> 06:35.956
Well, we members of his class, I believe there's 
five of us, went to A&M in the fall of 23. Had you had

06:36.056 --> 06:40.581
some experience, say, in the 4-H club? Yes, about 
1919, I believe it was. I was a member of the 4-H club

06:44.005 --> 06:47.650
in Dawson County. Mr. C.T. Watson was a county 
agent. Incidentally, I don't think Mr. Watson

06:50.893 --> 06:53.617
had. He was a graduate of an agricultural school, 
but he was a good county agent. And I was in the pig

06:59.830 --> 07:05.565
club, and I was in the cotton club, and I was in the 
milo club. By having something of my own, it really

07:05.625 --> 07:15.831
developed an interest on my part in agriculture.

07:16.402 --> 07:28.619
Through the county agent and the experiment 
station and your vocational agricultural

07:16.402 --> 07:28.619
teacher, you had some prior knowledge of Texas A&M 
by the time you graduated from Lubbock High

07:16.402 --> 07:28.619
School. That's right. And this was a basic basis 
for your deciding to go to school there. Yes, sir.

07:34.547 --> 07:41.237
There was no question, and I had about four 
classmates who went with me. Uh-huh. Did you go

07:41.883 --> 07:46.307
through any type of special procedures to be 
admitted to A&M? Not that I recall. We were just

07:48.309 --> 07:50.210
admitted down there. No problem to it at all. They 
just looked at your high school record or whatever

07:52.733 --> 07:56.936
took with us, you know. And nothing to tell. Of 
course, there were no scholarships then, to my

07:59.058 --> 08:03.302
knowledge or whatnot. Coming from a very poor 
family, I worked my way through A&M. So I milked

08:07.966 --> 08:10.388
cows down there. I was down at A&M there, four 
years. You milked cows for four years? Yes, sir.

08:18.042 --> 08:24.051
Well, I noticed you were in a dairy husbandry 
major, so were you working in the dairy barns then?

08:24.272 --> 08:30.281
That's the reason I majored in dairy husbandry, 
because I could get a job milking cows and

08:24.272 --> 08:30.281
delivering milk. I delivered milk to the mess 
hall, and I would always leave a jug of milk at the

08:37.165 --> 08:40.330
President's home, which was Dr. Bazell's at that 
time. On my way to the mess hall, I would leave a can

08:40.430 --> 08:47.141
of milk there on Dr. Bazell's back porch. Did you 
deliver milk to any of the other professors? No.

08:53.191 --> 08:56.436
But now I did milk the cows some for Dean Kyle. Dean 
was a bad coach at the time. He had a cow he kept in his

08:58.560 --> 09:01.705
yard. Was that a fairly common practice that the 
faculty members who lived on campus had to cow?

09:06.933 --> 09:09.496
They either had a cow or they had a garden or 
whatnot. I know I worked in the garden for

09:09.576 --> 09:16.726
Professor Stangle, who later became Dean Stangle 
out here. I kept up his garden as side work. Do you

09:21.492 --> 09:25.878
have any recollection of what you were paid per 
hour or per week? Yes, sir. I remember very well.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.802
Twenty-five cents an hour. This was for milking 
and delivering milk? Working in the gardens and

09:31.469 --> 09:33.873
whatever you did. That was standard wages then? 
One, five, six hours. But you know, I could go to

09:37.019 --> 09:42.889
school then, including everything, for just a 
little over $30 a month. And you could make that

09:43.791 --> 09:46.556
much then, I take it? Yes, I could. I did. I didn't 
get any help. What was your first reaction to the

09:51.064 --> 09:54.169
school when you arrived there?

09:57.203 --> 10:01.871
Well, it was good, but the freshman came down a few 
days early. So we were having a freshman party in

10:03.854 --> 10:14.130
the Land of the Hood rebuilding, the show building 
there, Texas A&M. And the sophomores run in on us

10:14.912 --> 10:18.918
about dark and said, air out. We didn't know what 
that was, but they were swinging belts.

10:24.862 --> 10:29.347
paddles, so we hired out there and steered to 
death. I'll never forget that I run right down to

10:29.367 --> 10:38.197
the railroad track just behind where Kyle Field 
was there then. Well, I run off into the water there

10:39.939 --> 10:45.845
that was up to my waist, but I got out of it and kept 
running. Ended up down there in a farmhouse in the

10:46.586 --> 10:52.152
chicken house of a farmer. And I stayed there 
probably till 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. I

10:57.103 --> 10:58.964
decided I'd go back to campus. But you know, if I'd 
had the money to pull a ticket home, I'd left there.

11:05.690 --> 11:07.572
But then they got back to campus. Well, the 
sophomore said, well, where you been? We didn't

11:10.695 --> 11:13.638
know anything about this. They kid me. So after 
that, I never was freed of it. Was there anybody

11:17.982 --> 11:22.746
there at the station? to meet you when you got to 
town or to the campus? They could have been, but I

11:27.060 --> 11:30.364
don't remember that they had been in by there. It 
was just about a walk, about a quarter mile to a half

11:30.384 --> 11:40.297
mile walk from the station down to the main 
building, and we found our way down there. I don't

11:40.397 --> 11:41.158
recall. It could have been, but I don't remember.

11:45.644 --> 11:52.412
How did you receive

11:45.644 --> 11:52.412
the assignment to your military company when 
you... Frankly, I don't know that either. All I

11:55.746 --> 12:04.658
know is I was placed in Company H infantry, and I 
don't know that that had been recommended to me or

11:55.746 --> 12:04.658
not. I don't know how I got to that. I had no 
knowledge of it. I know Ray Mowry was in the cadet

12:09.625 --> 12:13.010
corps. It was like you had to be almost then. That's 
a tale I'll say here and probably later. To me, it

12:18.437 --> 12:21.842
was one of the best parts of my college training, I 
wouldn't give a dime for a military career, but it

12:22.244 --> 12:26.188
was just excellent. But I don't know. I signed a 
couple of dates. And incidentally, my classmates

12:30.011 --> 12:33.795
from Lubbock were, too. And our first year was in 
Bazell Hall. And four of us roomed in one room there

12:37.058 --> 12:40.261
in Bazell Hall. That room then was probably 
designed for two, wasn't it? It was designed for

12:44.104 --> 12:44.985
two. And of course, after a good many freshmen 
bumped out or went home. Well, it was cut down to

12:50.746 --> 12:52.308
two. I presume there were some who had the money to 
buy a ticket home after that first airing out.

12:57.115 --> 13:01.581
Well, we didn't lose many on that, but I was scared 
to death. You know what they called me, and I told

13:02.563 --> 13:07.029
them I stayed out there in that chicken house. They 
called me Chicken House Davis. How long did that

13:10.654 --> 13:12.297
nickname stay with you? Oh, I'll never forget it. 
But just as soon as it got back to me, dormitory and

13:21.256 --> 13:26.302
saw that the sophomores were good boys, you know, 
and everything. Now they'd come in every once in a

13:26.903 --> 13:36.515
while, you know, make us bend over under the bed, 
hit us a time or two with their bells, but it was good

13:26.903 --> 13:36.515
boys. Just sort of let you know they were still 
there. That's right. And I believe in it still.

13:41.522 --> 13:45.387
What do they call it?

13:45.407 --> 13:50.453
I don't know what that is, but it'll come to mind 
after a while. But anyway, I think it was very good

13:50.888 --> 13:53.030
in its time. Well, hazing is the term that's 
commonly referred to that punishment of that

13:53.771 --> 14:02.579
charge. It was one of the best courses we had there. 
And of course, when we became sophomores, well, we

14:06.162 --> 14:14.150
took care of the freshmen and taught them how to be a 
man. Would you describe a typical day while you

14:20.588 --> 14:21.629
were in school? Well, my day was a little bit 
different from some. One thing to say, we all lived

14:27.556 --> 14:45.857
along Military Walk, and we marched to our meals 
every day of the week, including Sunday, and of

14:27.556 --> 14:45.857
course we marched to Gwine Hall on Sunday for the 
services there. But I would generally, as I say, I

14:45.877 --> 14:49.802
worked in the dairy down there, I would deliver 
milk in the morning. So I would go back. But the day

14:54.509 --> 14:59.656
down there to me was all of us were dressed as we 
should be. And we always had on a black necktie. And

15:05.544 --> 15:10.330
whenever you met anybody, if you didn't know them, 
you stuck out your hand or introduced yourself.

15:10.350 --> 15:11.572
I'm Freshman Davis. And if you didn't know them, 
and if you met an officer, you would salute him. And

15:19.077 --> 15:21.079
those things were good. They were very, very good. 
I just wish we had them today. But go to classes.

15:29.787 --> 15:31.608
Enjoy the classes thoroughly. And we would, 
generally, you'd have revelry, you know. And

15:40.676 --> 15:49.084
you had to have your lights out by a certain time 
before midnight. So we just pretty well stayed in

15:50.178 --> 15:53.782
our rooms the whole night. And since you had the job 
at the dairy barn, did you have to get up early and

15:54.323 --> 15:59.589
then milk the cows before breakfast? Yes, I did. I 
did. And did you have to report back to the dorm at

16:00.410 --> 16:02.612
Reveille? No. No, the Reveille was by night, 
wasn't it? Was it morning? Well, morning was

16:08.299 --> 16:09.600
usually Reveille. Morning Reveille, that's 
right. Anyway, yeah, we'd have taps by night. We'd

16:14.806 --> 16:16.067
have it both ways. But anyway, I... would carry the 
meal down to the mess hall and I would eat in the

16:18.325 --> 16:22.369
kitchen. But at noon, at dinner, lunch and dinner, 
I marched with the company down Military Walk.

16:36.905 --> 16:38.526
There was not a whole lot. Now we had the YMCA there 
then. We called it the Y, you know. do most anything

16:47.367 --> 16:52.832
there that read or study or visit or whatnot. You'd 
buy soft drinks there in the first floor of it. And

16:59.719 --> 17:01.801
was the swimming pool in there when you were there? 
No, the swimming pool, to my knowledge, was not

17:01.901 --> 17:04.524
there. Was there any place at all that you could 
swim if you were so inclined? Well, the only place

17:09.289 --> 17:13.813
I'd know would be Sealaw and go up to Browse River.

17:16.763 --> 17:20.427
You hiked down to the Brazos and take a swim, huh? 
Yeah, I hiked down to the Brazos and take a swim.

17:22.269 --> 17:22.709
Okay. Because we had our showers there. I believe 
you said you lived in Bazell. First year. First

17:29.076 --> 17:29.616
year. Where else did you live? Well, let's see. 
Bazell Hall and the dormitory right next to it.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.128
Goodwin? Goodwin, I believe. But the last year I 
was there, I was in Austin Hall, which is a

17:43.747 --> 17:49.514
two-story, one of the oldest. That's one of the old 
ones.

17:54.459 --> 17:57.743
That one probably didn't have central heat then, 
did it? Oh, no. We carried wood and water. Did you

18:01.147 --> 18:03.490
have a freshman to carry the wood and the water for 
you? Yes, sir. You bet. But as a freshman living in

18:05.512 --> 18:09.016
Bazell, you didn't have to do that then, did you? 
No, I don't believe we did. I believe some of the

18:10.698 --> 18:13.281
boys who lived in the older dorms had to. How

18:14.105 --> 18:19.512
was the life in the dormitories? I imagine it 
varied from building to building. Probably so,

18:22.477 --> 18:26.041
but I would say, generally speaking, it was quiet. 
We were down there to get an education. In those

18:31.309 --> 18:35.534
days, you know, you couldn't have a car on the 
campus. You would be automatically expelled if

18:35.555 --> 18:38.579
you owned a car. So the few that had them kept them 
very carefully hid over in Bryant. But very few

18:45.222 --> 18:47.405
people could own one. It had no parking problem. It 
had no parking lots. And another thing, you

18:51.993 --> 18:58.643
couldn't leave campus except on a court trip 
unless you got special permission. You just

18:59.024 --> 19:01.989
couldn't get in your car and drive to Houston or 
Dallas. We was there and we had our Sunday program

19:02.970 --> 19:09.120
just like we had our everyday class program. And 
you say your Sunday program, what would your

19:09.488 --> 19:12.811
Sunday program consist of? Well, generally about 
9, 30, or 10 o'clock, we would march down to Gwine

19:12.831 --> 19:18.457
Hall. And they would have a special sermon there 
for us. They'd get visiting pastors and people to

19:22.341 --> 19:29.849
come in. There would be some singing. I never did 
participate in any choir. But it was just like

19:35.314 --> 19:39.158
going to a church service here normally. But we all 
went to the same church. We marched down there, and

19:42.607 --> 19:46.410
we marched out. Did you have anything else on 
Sunday to occupy your time other than studying? I

19:51.955 --> 19:53.296
don't remember anything. I said occasionally 
we'd go down to Bryan's. I'll have to tell you one

19:55.338 --> 19:59.582
story about a trip down there pretty early in my 
freshman year. We went down there to Bryan's

20:00.763 --> 20:02.965
River, you know. We'd never been down there 
before. In fact, to come to this country, we just

20:04.406 --> 20:08.790
didn't have running rivers. We got real thirsty. 
We saw a house there and went up and asked if we could

20:11.906 --> 20:17.894
have a drink of water. We had a sister, you know, or a 
well with a bucket. Said we could and it was the home

20:22.760 --> 20:26.705
of a colored family. So me and my classmates or 
roommates We'd had a drink of water, you know, so I

20:32.767 --> 20:36.271
asked the man what his name was. He said his name was 
Davis.

20:40.415 --> 20:42.417
So I got quite a bit of river down there. My 
kinfolk's living down there in the Brazos

20:42.457 --> 20:45.960
Bottoms. I didn't even know about

20:45.980 --> 20:52.307
it. So you'd go down to the Brazos River for an 
occasional swim. That's right. And go into Bryan

20:55.370 --> 20:57.132
occasionally. Yes, go in. We went in on the 
trolley, you know. That's the only way you get in

21:00.495 --> 21:02.217
there. Being short of money, I didn't go in for 
picture shows. But that would be one of the things

21:07.124 --> 21:11.570
that students would go into Bryan for, the picture 
shows. We didn't have it on the campus when I was

21:11.590 --> 21:14.074
there. Now later they did, but in my time there. Did 
you have any much in the way of visiting lecturers

21:20.343 --> 21:28.815
to come in and speak about anything in particular? 
Not that I recall.

21:33.247 --> 21:41.776
Did you have any of the classes put on plays or 
anything of that nature for recreation? No, they

21:41.897 --> 21:44.920
could have, but at least I wasn't a part of it. And 
mind you, I didn't have what you might call a fool

21:45.601 --> 21:52.448
out there, because I worked part-time. But I don't 
recall that, and I was pretty active in the Lubbock

21:52.468 --> 21:57.394
High School in plays. But down there, well, I just 
happened to be there, and and the cadet corps I'd

22:03.267 --> 22:32.228
say repeatedly there's nothing I enjoyed anymore 
and I thought contributed more to my education

22:03.267 --> 22:32.228
than the cadet corps did but I was a first 
lieutenant but now my roommate or McCoy was

22:03.267 --> 22:32.228
captain of the company but it and I still have my 
sword or saber in there that 27 but uh We had a good

22:33.558 --> 22:36.200
life. Mine was a busy life, working my way through, 
and I was always stood up well in the classes and so

22:36.321 --> 22:45.349
forth. Today we generally think of students who 
work part-time working a maximum of 20 hours a

22:45.369 --> 22:51.795
week. About how much time did you put in in work, if 
you can remember? It probably wouldn't be a whole

22:57.140 --> 23:00.763
lot more than that, some more. But I tell you what, 
I've had to go down to the dairy barn again many

23:01.418 --> 23:12.135
evenings after dark and milk cows, because we'd 
have them on three times milking them. And I walked

23:12.155 --> 23:16.522
back to the dairy barn, which is just across the 
tracks there. We didn't have any pavement there or

23:17.884 --> 23:21.430
drainage. I stepped in those water holes. I 
remember them very distinctly. Yeah, I can

23:28.080 --> 23:29.282
imagine. It was probably not much in the way of 
outdoor lighting either, was there? No, very

23:32.747 --> 23:37.974
little or no lighting.

23:37.994 --> 23:41.398
But that time, I want to go back to Cadet Corps if you 
don't mind. Okay. That was, in those days, we had a

23:42.680 --> 23:45.663
horse cavalry. We had a horse artillery. And their 
barns, too, was across the tracks, not too far from

23:49.328 --> 23:53.854
the dairy barn. I didn't help take care of them. But 
at finished times, And then that was pretty soon

23:59.890 --> 24:17.327
after World War I, and A&M had contributed more 
officers, I believe, to World War I than any other

23:59.890 --> 24:17.327
school had, including West Point.

24:17.387 --> 24:29.458
I thoroughly enjoyed our military and our parades 
out there. What was the food like in the mess hall?

24:32.164 --> 24:40.551
Well, of course, it was good to me, but the common 
name down there for any kind of meat was bull neck.

24:41.832 --> 24:44.675
And the common name for any kind of dessert was 
kush. So I would say general was good. Of course,

24:47.797 --> 24:52.061
the students served us food. I never did work in the 
mess hall except deliver milk. The students would

24:56.585 --> 24:58.787
bring our plates to us. And I'd say we was well fed on 
a variety of foods and on a good diet. While you

25:08.310 --> 25:18.344
would hear complaints and all, but as a whole it was 
nutritional and well balanced and so forth, so I

25:08.310 --> 25:18.344
don't think there's any complaints. Complaints 
were probably more because of the lack of variety

25:18.364 --> 25:22.530
than... Well, probably so, but I think people 
would complain anyway, regardless of what they

25:22.882 --> 25:29.093
had. But I think it was good. Generally, you had 
your breakfast in the kitchen, though, I believe.

25:36.606 --> 25:45.362
I generally did, because I would bring the milk in 
the back door, and the cook would fix me a plate, and

25:36.606 --> 25:45.362
I'd sit over there. Incidentally, I'd sit at a 
table that wasn't too far from the football clubs.

25:50.698 --> 25:53.220
They had their tables back there. I think they 
would get a little better breakfast than I would,

25:53.240 --> 25:56.824
but the cook took care of me. Well, it's always good 
to have a friend in the cook, I would say.

26:04.591 --> 26:09.416
Did the upperclassmen have certain privileges 
that were denied to the freshmen? Well, not a whole

26:11.198 --> 26:14.421
lot that I recall. Of course, we had this hazing, 
which we mentioned. And there's no question of

26:20.000 --> 26:27.951
what the freshmen had to recognize in 
upperclassmen, particularly sophomores. But as

26:28.852 --> 26:34.600
a whole, I would say that it was a very cooperative 
and congenial group. And frankly, I didn't miss

26:35.541 --> 26:43.632
anything as a freshman or a sophomore that 
somebody else had. If he had more, I didn't know

26:44.303 --> 26:46.547
him. So our officers would eat right at the same 
table with us. But I presume it probably was a

26:51.436 --> 26:57.306
little easier for a sophomore or a junior to get off 
campus than it was for a freshman. Well, it could

26:57.326 --> 26:59.490
have been, but not very much. It's pretty tight on 
all of them. Those days and times, you just

27:01.794 --> 27:04.779
couldn't run off the date. Maybe could you have a 
date down there?

27:13.902 --> 27:17.446
We've talked a little bit about, say, 
entertainment and recreation. Are there, such as

27:17.486 --> 27:29.280
swimming and going down to Bryan for the movies, 
and a few things you could do at the Y, presumably

27:17.486 --> 27:29.280
games of dominoes or cards of some sort, or were 
cards allowed? Well, if there were, I never did see

27:30.201 --> 27:32.364
any. You sure had to keep them hid. There's no 
question now about what. We were not taken care of

27:38.691 --> 27:43.116
on an entertainment level. then that you would be 
today. But frankly, I didn't miss it because I

27:45.360 --> 27:49.986
hadn't been used to it and so forth. But there's 
just no question at all about this difference

27:50.006 --> 27:53.571
today. Well, there certainly are lots of 
opportunities for entertainment and recreation

27:54.693 --> 27:58.458
today. What would the students say? You could have 
a radio and a television today, but we didn't have

28:00.120 --> 28:04.546
anything. You couldn't even have a radio. No, we 
didn't have a radio. They didn't even know what

28:07.771 --> 28:11.095
they were.

28:12.982 --> 28:23.555
Did the cadet officers enjoy any special 
privileges that were not available to the normal

28:12.982 --> 28:23.555
cadets? I don't think so. I know as I became a senior 
and a first lieutenant, I don't remember having

28:24.556 --> 28:35.710
any particular privileges which I didn't have and 
sort of fit in. As we come along, I came up on Dairy

28:38.986 --> 28:41.749
100. We had our judging team, went to Chicago, went 
to Detroit, and went to different dairy shows and

28:41.789 --> 28:53.123
judging contests and so forth. But that was not in 
my senior year. That was back in my sophomore or

28:57.228 --> 29:02.074
junior year. One person I talked to mentioned that 
the company commanders, the captains, each had a

29:02.797 --> 29:12.692
pass to the theater in Bryan. If you did, I didn't 
know it. Well, you weren't a company commander. My

29:16.158 --> 29:19.603
roommate, I believe, would have told me about it if 
he ever had my room. Well, that might not have been a

29:19.623 --> 29:21.606
regular thing. If you did, I didn't know.

29:27.295 --> 29:29.378
Did you have any favorite instructors? Well, no, I 
tell you, actually, I enjoyed all my instructors.

29:35.220 --> 29:45.475
I would have to say a dear hundred that Professor 
Darnell, I thought, was the strongest, the late

29:35.220 --> 29:45.475
Darnell, who died a few years ago. But these two men 
and their statements I'll always remember. One

29:49.381 --> 29:53.927
was the dean of agriculture, and incidentally, I 
believe he taught some classes. He also had been

29:53.947 --> 29:55.690
dean. One statement he made was, He said, remember 
this, if you always work hard enough and wait long

29:58.282 --> 30:03.748
enough, you'll come out all right. And that's been 
true all along. The other statement was made by Dr.

30:07.272 --> 30:12.799
Virgil P. Lee, who was in economics class. He said 
this, he said, sure, we need, not we need

30:13.580 --> 30:23.071
management, we need capital, those things, but 
remember the most important thing is people. That

30:23.892 --> 30:26.515
has meant a lot to me since then, too. Those are the 
two statements that I recall mostly when I was down

30:28.538 --> 30:31.265
there. Of course, I not only took care of Dean 
Stangle's yard while he was there and he came out

30:31.285 --> 30:41.490
here, but I enjoyed him as a teacher and others down 
there. The dean you mentioned would have been Dean

30:41.871 --> 30:44.597
Kyle. Dean Kyle, yes, Dean Kyle.
