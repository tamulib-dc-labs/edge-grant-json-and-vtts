00:14.138 --> 00:28.398
Now, first

00:14.138 --> 00:28.398
I'd like you to explain to me your educational 
background. How and why did you acquire your

00:29.059 --> 00:33.385
degree? Where did you go to school? What were your 
interests? Well, I was born over in eastern

00:37.751 --> 00:42.357
Washington in 1905. on a farm between two trout 
streams.

00:51.103 --> 01:03.120
I went to the proverbial one-room schoolhouse for 
a number of years until I got to about the eighth

00:51.103 --> 01:03.120
grade when I went to high school. The eighth grade I 
took in town to prepare for the high school, which I

01:03.640 --> 01:12.613
attended and graduated in 19. Well, this is just 
after, shortly after World War I. At times, we

01:21.134 --> 01:32.070
weren't quite in the Depression then, but times 
weren't too good.

01:39.863 --> 01:45.489
decided when I got through high school, which was 
1922, that I was going to go on to university. I

01:45.509 --> 01:52.216
thought that I could better myself by going to 
university. But first I had to go out and make a

01:54.258 --> 01:58.902
little bit of money before I could do that. So I 
worked in the lumber mills and harvest fields and

02:07.032 --> 02:13.942
on concrete gangs and section gangs and what not.

02:15.144 --> 02:19.130
In a couple of years I had enough of a stake to come on 
to university. Well in high school I sort of liked

02:19.931 --> 02:26.380
physics

02:19.931 --> 02:26.380
and sciences. One thing we didn't have was 
chemistry. So I looked over the field then and it

02:29.645 --> 02:36.735
looked to me as though if you took chemistry and did 
fairly well in it why you had a broad spectrum that

02:37.019 --> 03:04.630
you could later go into and so I took chemistry

02:37.019 --> 03:04.630
and but I wasn't able to go full-time too long I'd 
work on the side and lay off and from school and

03:05.302 --> 03:10.910
work, so I didn't finish up my bachelor's until 
about 1930.

03:16.137 --> 03:32.440
During this time, I continued my work in different 
manual

03:16.137 --> 03:32.440
endeavors. piling lumber and a few things like 
that. As a matter of fact, I made more money piling

03:36.237 --> 03:48.013
lumber than I did for many years after I had my Ph.D.

03:48.033 --> 03:54.522
But one of the chemistry professors here was 
Professor Honesty Thompson. And so I

03:56.585 --> 04:01.752
was in his quant class in chemistry and 
qualitative analysis class. Later on, I was his

04:10.610 --> 04:12.933
teaching fellow. And he got me interested in some 
of the work that was going on. One of the first

04:19.919 --> 04:31.890
things we did that he was concerned with was a 
saltwater intrusion into Lake Washington and

04:19.919 --> 04:31.890
Lake Union system through the ship canal. And so we 
went there with a bunch of us as students, graduate

04:32.528 --> 04:38.975
students. We worked on this problem to see the 
efficiency of the locks and getting rid of the salt

04:41.137 --> 04:59.717
water that they brought back into the lake and into 
the canal system.

05:00.288 --> 05:08.497
This started me, got me interested in water 
movements, water chemistry, water flow. So, I

05:09.879 --> 05:30.042
ended up by getting a, finally got a master's, or 
finally got a doctorate in the fall of 36. here at

05:30.190 --> 05:37.400
the university in chemistry with a minor in 
physics.

05:38.602 --> 05:54.544
But before that time, I was at Friday Harbor with 
Dr. Thompson in 1931 and 1932 when this building

05:38.602 --> 05:54.544
was was built. He had gotten some Rockefeller 
funds to build this building here on the campus

05:56.579 --> 06:03.665
with. And he had organized the oceanographic 
laboratories.

06:11.111 --> 06:24.683
And so we worked out of Friday Harbor in the summer 
outside the school year from June through August.

06:25.625 --> 06:35.234
working on the waters of the system from the Strait 
of Juan de Fuca into the Strait of Georgia and into

06:25.625 --> 06:35.234
Puget Sound. Then in 1933, the opportunity

06:37.196 --> 06:55.294
came to go with the Navy up to Adak and make some 
oceanographic observations. making a survey of

06:55.865 --> 07:00.432
the harbors, the waters around Adak. And so this 
gave me an opportunity to go out in the field. And

07:04.378 --> 07:11.689
then I left my teaching fellowship here. I got 
someone else to pinch hit for me. And I went up in May

07:14.633 --> 07:18.940
and didn't get back until, oh, long in September. 
And I did some of the first oceanographic work. by

07:25.396 --> 07:30.562
U.S. up in the Bering Sea. And next summer, I went up 
on a Coast Guard vessel and worked from the

07:32.244 --> 07:50.065
Aleutian Islands up through Bering Strait and the 
eastern part of Bering Sea. And this material, was

07:55.484 --> 07:59.448
the basis of my doctoral dissertation.

08:03.412 --> 08:12.241
By the time I got through, there were really no jobs 
in oceanography in that day. No one knew of

08:12.281 --> 08:16.125
oceanographers. In fact,

08:16.185 --> 08:23.753
one well-known man, from Texas and Fisheries that 
I knew said that he didn't have any use for

08:24.374 --> 08:38.308
oceanography and he wouldn't know an 
oceanographer if he saw one. And what's more, he

08:38.328 --> 08:45.315
never expected a need or hire one.

08:45.335 --> 08:53.824
Well, this was along in the Depression days.

08:54.226 --> 09:07.664
And

08:54.226 --> 09:07.664
as a part-time work, before I got my degree, I also 
joined some other labs and set up a spray residue

08:54.226 --> 09:07.664
laboratory. Then people were becoming concerned 
with the arsenic and the lead on apples. So I worked

09:14.573 --> 09:18.698
with the pure food and drugs. and then I had our own 
private lab. It didn't make too much money because

09:21.053 --> 09:28.205
it was seasonal, but that gave me a little boost. 
And then when I finally finished up in 1936, the

09:28.947 --> 09:42.610
depression was still pretty strong, but one of my 
co-teaching fellows, Bert Thomas, who was later

09:43.484 --> 09:58.277
president and director of Battelle Memorial 
Institute, had gone back to Columbus and was just

09:43.484 --> 09:58.277
getting pretty well established. And when I came 
along, he urged me to come back to Columbus, Ohio at

09:58.918 --> 10:11.449
Battelle, which I did from late 1936. through 
until 1940. But I was still looking for some way to

10:14.306 --> 10:18.031
get back out to sea.

10:20.975 --> 10:24.160
As you know, Columbus is pretty well landlocked.

10:28.286 --> 10:37.960
And a civil service announcement came through for 
someone,

10:28.286 --> 10:37.960
a physical oceanographer, work with the 
International Ice Patrol. And so I applied,

10:43.408 --> 10:59.010
filled in my application for that, sent in my 
resume, and I was chosen to fill that billet. And at

10:59.030 --> 11:06.360
the time, I think, I ended up, at that time, I think I 
was one of three physical oceanographers and

10:59.030 --> 11:06.360
employee of the United States government. The 
other one, Floyd Sowell, also being up, another

11:07.808 --> 11:16.201
one being on the International Ice Board all 
night, and the other one, I guess, was down in

11:07.808 --> 11:16.201
Washington. So I went to Woods Hole in 1940, and a 
typical New England blizzard drove up from

11:18.484 --> 11:33.327
Columbus, Ohio, and it was the last car on the road 
before I finally got into a Falmouth Mass and took a

11:33.475 --> 11:43.888
night's lodging before I pushed on to Woods Hole 
because the drifts were three and four feet deep

11:33.475 --> 11:43.888
across the road.

11:46.991 --> 11:50.856
And then I joined Floyd's Soul on the 
International Ice Patrol. This was in February of

11:50.876 --> 11:54.500
1940. In March, we pushed off for the Grand Banks 
with the summer base at Newfoundland, St. John's,

12:01.943 --> 12:31.866
to work out the dynamics of the flow patterns in the 
ice patrol area so that we could predict about

12:01.943 --> 12:31.866
where the birds would move and to afford guidance 
to the

12:01.943 --> 12:31.866
maritime interests so they could avoid the 
iceberg areas as a basis of changing the routes

12:32.133 --> 12:43.649
depending on how much ice we had and how many birds 
we had down in the area and so on. Well, I was on that

12:45.692 --> 12:57.389
job in 1940, but things were beginning to get a 
little sticky along in 1940. So we... I cruised the

13:01.175 --> 13:15.890
east and west coasts of Greenland, up as far as Cape 
York on the west coast, throughout Baffin Bay, and

13:01.175 --> 13:15.890
doing a little bit of seeing how things were going. 
You weren't hunting for German submarines? Not

13:18.833 --> 13:20.574
submarines. We did pick up a few people. One of them 
was a good Norwegian, Willie Knudsen, who had We

13:30.740 --> 13:35.566
picked up in East Greenland and brought him out to 
the States. The Knudsen family is famous in

13:35.786 --> 13:40.051
oceanography. And I saw him some years later when 
he was a captain in the Air Force.

13:48.802 --> 14:00.055
But then in 1941, it was more or less a repeat of 
1940.

14:03.826 --> 14:23.970
One of the things that we did do

14:03.826 --> 14:23.970
was do, in 1940, we

14:03.826 --> 14:23.970
heard a number of SOS's when we were out on ice 
patrol. So we put in St. John's and I cruised up

14:29.279 --> 14:50.719
towards Denmark's strait where the ships had been 
torpedoed, and with Sol and the skipper and the

14:29.279 --> 14:50.719
staff, we worked out the probable position of 
where the drifting boats might be, and we got up

14:29.279 --> 14:50.719
into the area. On one day, I think it was Sunday, we 
heard the planes overhead, which is very unusual

14:57.747 --> 15:04.897
for that part of the

14:57.747 --> 15:04.897
North Atlantic. We couldn't dope it out, and our 
codes wouldn't break any of the messages, so we

15:06.259 --> 15:12.227
didn't have high enough classification for that.

15:15.151 --> 15:17.654
During the night, we heard that the hood had been 
sunk.

15:21.179 --> 15:22.641
Did you find any survivors? We picked up two 
lifeboats, not from this supply, but from the

15:22.739 --> 15:34.356
torpedoed ships, TS Marconi. We picked up their 
SOS and got their approximate position. We picked

15:39.724 --> 15:41.547
up two of those lifeboats. It was in dense fog. And 
we'd run a little ways and stop. And one time when we

15:47.484 --> 15:52.468
were stopped, we heard voices out on the sea. And 
one of the boats, we kept blasting our new whistle.

15:58.593 --> 16:02.137
And one of the boats came right up alongside us. We 
took them aboard. They went out about six, seven

16:03.178 --> 16:06.500
days then, because we had to come in from patrol. 
And we fueled and provisioned to go up and pick them

16:06.821 --> 16:10.984
up. And then during that. a break while we were 
continuing our search. We heard some very heavy

16:19.848 --> 16:24.554
cannonading going on. But being on a 125-footer 
painted white, we didn't have any particular

16:25.155 --> 16:31.983
qualms about that. And so on the breaks, we found 
another lifeboat. We picked it up. So we picked up

16:37.210 --> 16:39.313
39 survivors. We had 36 aboard our own ship, and we 
brought them back to St. John's. Well, at the end of

16:45.629 --> 16:54.987
1941, of course, by that time, we were getting 
involved.

16:56.951 --> 17:07.772
So instead of working out of Woods Hole and getting 
back once in a while, was assigned to Argentia and

17:08.326 --> 17:12.470
slapped into a uniform.

17:17.495 --> 17:31.289
Spent from then until about 1946,

17:17.495 --> 17:31.289
early 1946, on the scouting for eyes. First I 
hitchhiked on the different planes, then I got

17:31.349 --> 17:36.915
some planes and finally a few ships to run around up 
there. Played around in the North Atlantic and

17:41.380 --> 17:54.755
covered the area from the Nova Scotian and Grand 
Banks up through Baffin Bay, Ungava Bay, and west

17:41.380 --> 17:54.755
to Churchill. So that was my area. Were

17:58.278 --> 18:04.185
you trying to trace the sea lanes open for the Navy? 
What we were doing was two things. First, we were

18:09.841 --> 18:33.936
trying to be able to predict ahead of time where the 
ice edge would be

18:09.841 --> 18:33.936
found so that we could try to keep them close to it 
but not into it so that we could cover the ships by

18:09.841 --> 18:33.936
plane from a land base to keep the subs down.

18:34.473 --> 18:53.094
then be able to have enough flexibility to make the 
convoy routings so that we wouldn't cross paths

18:34.473 --> 18:53.094
with convoys and all these things that you have to 
be aware of besides the ice in the area. And then the

18:53.815 --> 19:01.003
problem also was being able to predict as soon as we 
could get the ships into where we were... putting

19:01.372 --> 19:13.410
the bases in

19:01.372 --> 19:13.410
for running small planes, because at that time it 
appeared as though we might have to fly a lot of

19:01.372 --> 19:13.410
small planes across to Europe. And so we had bases, 
airstrips,

19:13.430 --> 19:30.535
through a part of the area over in Greenland and up 
in the Canadian, northern Canada.

19:31.527 --> 19:49.797
Part of the problem was to be able to predict just 
when the ice would open up so you could get the ships

19:31.527 --> 19:49.797
into the base without them setting off the ice edge 
and setting docks for any protracted period where

19:31.527 --> 19:49.797
they were vulnerable. And so this

19:51.360 --> 19:57.670
was the... the sequence there. And then... Were 
you trying to base your predictions on ocean

20:01.330 --> 20:03.733
currents? We used, yes. Insofar as around Grand 
Banks, we always made our dynamic charts. And in

20:14.683 --> 20:27.015
the days pre-calculator or pre the modern 
electronic devices,

20:27.552 --> 20:39.224
Sol and myself would get out a chart of the dynamic 
topography, which would give us some idea of the

20:27.552 --> 20:39.224
probable ice drift. And we generally completed 
the chart within two hours after we took our last

20:39.244 --> 20:45.410
oceanographic station.

20:48.272 --> 20:56.901
And so we had a good picture of where the icebergs 
would tend to come down on the eastern edge of the

20:48.272 --> 20:56.901
Grand Banks. where they would switch over into the 
extension of the Gulf Stream, the North Atlantic

20:57.151 --> 21:04.860
Current, and start off to the Northeast. And it was 
this important part that enabled

21:05.801 --> 21:23.361
us to set the shipping lanes and convoy routes, 
because you The shortest way, by great circle,

21:24.320 --> 21:29.825
would cut right across the banks, right through 
the ice area. And so we liked to be able to route them

21:30.887 --> 21:41.877
as close as possible without getting into ice 
difficulty.

21:46.062 --> 21:52.588
So along came 1936, and we were through with this 
particular job and I got orders to go to Washington

21:53.362 --> 22:02.595
and the Marshall Islands. Ah, okay.

22:07.482 --> 22:21.782
And so I went from Argentia, Newfoundland through 
Frisco to Hawaii at the Marshall Islands without

22:07.482 --> 22:21.782
coming back through Seattle. the family being in 
Seattle when I was away for about five years. And

22:26.588 --> 22:46.015
so we were out on the bow ditch to make the 
pre-survey of Bikini, to find out something about

22:26.588 --> 22:46.015
the currents, to establish the...

22:49.066 --> 23:12.819
the biological regimes, to get a survey of those, 
both on shore on the different islands of the

22:49.066 --> 23:12.819
atolls, both at Bikini and at Inuitak and at 
Ronzeland. Who worked with you in measuring the

23:12.839 --> 23:15.883
currents here? Well, I had some of the then, I would 
say, the young bloods in the game with me on the

23:17.146 --> 23:30.022
Bowditch. Roger Revell was on another ship that 
had sort of an overall project, but I was on the

23:32.205 --> 23:45.381
physical subgroup that was on the Bowditch that 
did the preliminary survey. So we had Walter Monk,

23:45.732 --> 24:13.005
Gordon Riley, Martin Johnson,

23:45.732 --> 24:13.005
Marston Sargent, and Bill Van Arks, Bill Ford, one 
of the Canadian chaps

23:45.732 --> 24:13.005
with us, Tommy Austin, Hal Turner from Woods Hole. 
Most of the people were from Woods Hole. One,

24:19.876 --> 24:25.678
except for Walter Monk and some of the others, we 
had William Randolph Taylor from Michigan,

24:25.945 --> 24:33.817
Leonard P. Schultz from the National Museum. We 
picked up several people who are still in the

24:34.478 --> 24:42.230
service one way or the other, one service or 
another. Mel Traylor had been with the Marines. He

24:44.493 --> 24:52.746
was one of my assistants.

24:54.177 --> 25:03.171
We had Vern Brock from Hawaii,

24:54.177 --> 25:03.171
and a number of others. Ken Emery from USC and 
Scripps. So we had a

25:10.122 --> 25:15.831
fairly sizable group. that we used in this survey 
starting in about February when we got out there

25:16.435 --> 25:28.647
and all set up in 1946.

25:31.830 --> 25:44.303
We carried through Project Abel and Baker and I got 
back to Washington D.C. along about September of

25:31.830 --> 25:44.303
that year. Had you known any of those guys before? 
Some I had known. Of course, Martin Johnson was

25:50.306 --> 25:54.050
originally from the University of Washington. I 
knew him. Schultz had been here for a while.

25:57.214 --> 25:59.997
Donaldson over in fisheries was on one of the other 
ships. So I knew some of that group. It

26:03.301 --> 26:09.308
was my first meeting with some of the younger 
people. That was the first time you met Walter

26:09.569 --> 26:11.551
Mook, wasn't it? I met... I think so, although I've 
been down at...

26:24.222 --> 26:27.686
I believe this was the first time that I actually 
met Walter.

26:30.850 --> 26:34.835
What did you expect to happen when you discovered 
they were going to drop a bomb? Did you have any

26:34.875 --> 26:42.484
anticipation of events?

26:43.578 --> 26:55.176
I think, as you know, there's lots of things we 
didn't know, just what the bomb would do and all.

26:56.137 --> 27:10.058
But

26:56.137 --> 27:10.058
we did, I think, come up with a pretty fair analysis 
of what was likely to happen with the radiation

26:56.137 --> 27:10.058
that got into the water. We had, in fact, built on 
arcs, went back to Woods Hole and built a little

27:10.544 --> 27:18.892
model to help out some of our studies. He

27:20.393 --> 27:31.003
was able to

27:20.393 --> 27:31.003
make enough checks with our field measurements. 
We had a pretty good feeling of what was going to

27:32.084 --> 27:40.112
happen to the stuff that got into the water.

27:40.430 --> 27:49.423
a job to really look at that that went into the 
atmosphere, because we didn't know that. But if it

27:49.563 --> 27:57.774
did come down in the water in the area, we knew 
enough about the general currents and so on to know

27:49.563 --> 27:57.774
a little bit about where to expect it to go. So I 
believe that we had a good feeling for the limits of

28:10.417 --> 28:14.081
what might be put on it. And nothing came amiss as 
far

28:14.321 --> 28:26.793
as what wasn't within the realm of what we knew.

28:26.913 --> 28:38.905
And afterwards, of course, we had to go in and do a 
little bit of some measurements to get an idea of

28:26.913 --> 28:38.905
how it had obeyed what we thought might happen. And 
also to take a reassessment of some of the biota in

28:43.471 --> 28:55.869
the system.

28:55.889 --> 28:58.013
And you were reasonably satisfied with the 
results? You think you did a pretty good job when

28:58.033 --> 29:00.016
you went back in? I think we did a reasonable job. 
Now, with our with our group there. And I have a

29:08.200 --> 29:13.467
picture of that group that was with me that I'll 
show you later that you may be interested in.

29:16.411 --> 29:36.297
But it seemed to be pretty well in hand by the time 
along

29:16.411 --> 29:36.297
about the first of September, late August, when I 
finally felt that I could leave. and get back to

29:36.783 --> 29:40.287
Washington, D.C.

29:43.210 --> 30:05.035
So I returned to Washington, D.C. and wound up some 
of my immediate duties there and made

29:43.210 --> 30:05.035
arrangements to move my family possessions from 
Woods Hole to Washington, DC. And I came back and

30:11.771 --> 30:31.562
took a little time off before I went back to 
Washington to join Dick Fleming in the

30:11.771 --> 30:31.562
Hydrographic Office. oceanography section 
there, which was just being set up at that time. So I

30:38.818 --> 30:51.393
was in hydro with Dick Fleming, and we had two 
people that had been out with us, two or three

30:38.818 --> 30:51.393
people that had actually been out with us on the 
Bikini. I came back, John Lyman was one of them, and

30:52.014 --> 31:00.925
Tommy Austin.

31:01.259 --> 31:12.248
another and

31:01.259 --> 31:12.248
Horace Whaley was another and later went to 
Chesapeake Bay Institute.
