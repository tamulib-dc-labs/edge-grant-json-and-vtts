WEBVTT

00:02.984 --> 00:12.495
during the election which in hindsight you think 
was unkind or anything like that? No, we were

00:12.855 --> 00:24.889
pretty good friends and we didn't, we didn't, if it 
was I didn't, if it was Roger got away with it

00:12.855 --> 00:24.889
because I didn't find out about it. So you won and 
what was the margin or do you remember? I think it

00:29.174 --> 00:29.835
was 55-60%, something like that. Did Dean 
Hannigan or anyone else call you in and give you any

00:34.381 --> 00:41.830
guidance or direction or? Afterward?

00:45.355 --> 00:45.495
Mm-hmm. Uh-uh. All right, what did you think your 
role was as president of the student body? Well, I

00:50.781 --> 00:58.371
looked at it kind of from, we looked at it a little 
bit from a point of view of trying to get people to

01:00.325 --> 01:06.751
think that it meant something instead of just 
holding office and voting on a new constitution or

01:00.325 --> 01:06.751
whatever. And so that's when we decided to do the 
refrigerator deal. We knew that a lot of students

01:10.875 --> 01:19.743
couldn't afford to pay $300

01:10.875 --> 01:19.743
for a little refrigerator in their dorm. And we 
didn't have permission from the administration

01:21.224 --> 01:26.289
to put the refrigerators in the dorm because of the 
electricity they would use anyway. But we found

01:27.350 --> 01:30.012
this company that sold refrigerators and they 
didn't want to sell them for 10 or 15 bucks a month

01:30.751 --> 01:58.058
payment but they said if we can do two or three 
thousand of them we can do them for 10 or 15 bucks a

01:30.751 --> 01:58.058
month and then take them back at the end of the year 
and stuff like that so we went we got permission

01:30.751 --> 01:58.058
from dr williams to put the refrigerators in and 
use the extra juice and then we got brought the

01:30.751 --> 01:58.058
company in to

01:58.257 --> 02:09.050
start selling them and we sold them, we leased them 
through the student government and so thousands

01:58.257 --> 02:09.050
of them, I mean almost every dorm room eventually 
wound up having one. It turned into the huge cash

02:09.070 --> 02:27.673
flow deal for for student government even to the 
point where we wouldn't have needed any money from

02:09.070 --> 02:27.673
the university or MSC to to finance operations and 
then that's when we moved started working on the

02:27.957 --> 02:28.678
two other things. We started working on the buses 
which eventually like six months afterwards came

02:28.698 --> 02:38.712
into being and we started working on a student 
credit union. We wanted to bring a student credit

02:39.132 --> 02:42.918
union in and the banks locally just went crazy. I 
mean they just screamed and hollered and started

02:43.318 --> 02:50.488
putting students on their boards, all those kinds 
of stuff to offset that. I think eventually a

02:51.816 --> 03:02.990
credit union came in, but it was pretty seriously 
opposed by financial institutions around

02:51.816 --> 03:02.990
College Station and Bryan when we were trying to 
bring a student credit union in. Did you have any

03:03.010 --> 03:10.119
dreams, plans that obviously in hindsight 
weren't any good? That weren't any good? I'm sure I

03:13.663 --> 03:14.765
forgot. I'm sure I did, but I worked hard to forget 
them. Who did you turn to for advice? Probably

03:22.109 --> 03:31.517
just a little cabinet I had. There was a guy named 
Randy Ross, and there was a guy named Mike Esmeyer,

03:31.537 --> 03:37.383
who was really a hard worker. He's the one that did 
the refrigerators. And I lived with the Corps

03:38.984 --> 03:45.970
staff and the Corps commander and all those folks. 
So the closest people to me were my fellow members

03:45.990 --> 03:50.074
of Corps staff. Was there a kind of an unofficial 
campus student inner circle? Yeah. Who were they?

03:58.939 --> 03:59.400
What were they? Well, it was, it was, it was core 
staff, the head of civilian student council, the

04:05.815 --> 04:11.622
cabinet of student government and Kirk Hawkins 
and the folks at the MSC. They kind of got together

04:11.642 --> 04:15.166
pretty regularly to do stuff. And did y'all ever go 
as a group to present any master plan of any sort to

04:17.408 --> 04:24.576
Dr. Williams? Yeah, we wanted to do a, we revised 
the student constitution to allow more civilian

04:26.138 --> 04:34.948
input. We thought that And the Corps was not real 
crazy about that. But it turned out good, because

04:40.146 --> 04:51.425
if we had kept it like it was, it was almost 
impossible to ever get any serious number of

04:40.146 --> 04:51.425
civilians into student government. It's 
probably like a little Nixon gone to China deal.

04:54.329 --> 04:58.116
Somebody in the Corps could do that, but Capernaum 
couldn't, or somebody like that. And so we devised

04:58.136 --> 05:01.962
a new constitution that allowed allowed people 
within student government to be elected from

05:03.308 --> 05:22.169
dormitories instead of popular vote just you know 
because we could one area could could block work

05:03.308 --> 05:22.169
the whole thing and I think that wound up helping 
because it got everybody involved in stuff at

05:03.308 --> 05:22.169
school. What in hindsight what did you learn from 
that year that would be important to you in your

05:22.970 --> 05:31.780
public leadership years after that? I guess, you 
know, I thought back to that time a lot. I got a real

05:39.407 --> 05:42.210
charge out of doing stuff. I mean, the 
refrigerator sounded like, you know, not a very

05:43.271 --> 05:54.502
big deal, but to a lot of students, that is a big 
deal, because they no longer had to walk all the way

05:43.271 --> 05:54.502
to Northgate or somewhere to get food that night if 
they wanted to eat in the dorm. They could have

05:54.522 --> 06:00.568
something right there, and they never had that 
before, and that, I remember We get calls, we get

06:01.105 --> 06:05.870
letters from people saying, hey, that was a neat 
deal and stuff like that. And I like that feeling. I

06:08.352 --> 06:10.314
like that part of it. I think it did a lot to make me 
think public service might be something I want to

06:10.434 --> 06:15.720
get into. All right. Did you learn some negative 
things, some things not to try, not to do in later

06:16.320 --> 06:21.406
life? Yeah, I'm sure. But I can't think of them at 
the time. You don't remember? Yeah, don't talk to

06:30.115 --> 06:31.377
the press. Hayden Whitsitt. I remember the editor 
of the battalion was, we were all very wary of him

06:34.341 --> 06:41.572
and that's a feeling that hasn't left me. Dealing 
with the press. When you were getting ready to

06:46.078 --> 06:55.772
leave the campus as an Aggie graduate, how well 
prepared did you think A&M had made you? Oh, I think

06:56.653 --> 06:58.416
good. But as good as the academic part of it was, I 
have always believed that from what I have done in

06:58.683 --> 07:15.323
life, the outside of academic stuff was at least as 
important. The student government service, the

07:15.423 --> 07:20.910
core, and things like that were I mean, I think you 
have an opportunity at A&M, even if you're not in

07:23.017 --> 07:39.221
the Corps because of the opportunities the MSC 
avails you, that you have an opportunity to get two

07:23.017 --> 07:39.221
degrees, every kid does, one in academics and one 
in leadership, and the second one's free if you

07:23.017 --> 07:39.221
choose it.

07:43.267 --> 07:50.458
What is it, maybe this is repetitive, what has it 
meant to you that you are an Aggie? Well, it's meant

07:51.147 --> 07:53.649
an awful lot. I mean, I think if, God, I try to think 
of what would happen if I had not gone to A&M and had

07:53.829 --> 08:05.120
gone to some other college. I just get the 
impression that in most instances, some other

08:05.600 --> 08:19.973
college gives you a degree, a few people that 
you've known, and that's a wonderful deal, and I'm

08:05.600 --> 08:19.973
sure you'll make a great accountant and go down the 
road. What I got here was just as good or better,

08:20.813 --> 08:29.923
probably a better degree, particularly as A&M's 
stature has grown. I mean, it's kind of like the

08:29.983 --> 08:31.544
stock market. Every year A&M gets better and 
better nationally, and my degree is worth more and

08:31.604 --> 08:35.388
more. But aside from that, I think I've got a little 
share of stock in an entire network of people. If I

08:46.100 --> 08:49.183
need to go, if I need to talk about It's an 
accounting firm that I own part of now. If I need to

08:52.363 --> 09:15.193
talk to somebody in Frito-Lay about tax policy or 
accounting or something like that, I'll find

08:52.363 --> 09:15.193
somebody in there that's got dash 73 or something 
by their name in the directory, and that's who I go

08:52.363 --> 09:15.193
to and say, who's the head duck and tell me how to get 
there. And nine times out of ten, they can tell me

09:15.233 --> 09:19.339
how to get there or they are the head duck. Let's 
make believe that you were hired now as a

09:20.669 --> 09:26.160
consultant to the Texas A&M leadership today. 
That I was what? That you're hiring out as a

09:28.064 --> 09:29.747
consultant? Yeah. What advice would you give them 
about Texas A&M right now?

09:38.344 --> 09:39.226
To do or not do? I would tell them that you are under 
utilizing your assets and getting money out of the

09:43.585 --> 09:49.653
state and federal government for this 
institution. That's what I tell them. I tell them

09:51.936 --> 09:55.580
you're sitting there with 254 county agents. 
You're sitting there with God knows how many

09:56.702 --> 10:03.070
captains or vice captains of industry all over the 
place. All of which tomorrow would call a

10:07.531 --> 10:15.218
legislator and say, let me talk to you about 
scholarship program at A&M, or let me talk to you

10:07.531 --> 10:15.218
about this line item, and all those kinds of 
things. I mean, you could, you could bury them in,

10:16.119 --> 10:25.607
in goodwill, and we have never done that. What 
else? Anything you'd advise them to change or

10:27.048 --> 10:29.811
never change? Well, I'll tell you what, they've 
done a lot better in the, in the spirit category

10:32.053 --> 10:36.897
than I thought was going to happen in 1972 when I saw 
it in the rear view mirror that day. And so I sure

10:41.967 --> 10:45.731
wouldn't change that. I think they're doing a good 
job in recruiting kids and every kid I know wants to

10:45.811 --> 10:53.498
come here except mine. Let's make believe that 
someone walked up to you and handed you a check for a

10:55.380 --> 11:01.786
million dollars with one restriction on it. You 
must pass it on to Texas A&M But you can decide to use

11:04.501 --> 11:07.425
to be made of that money. If you could make a major 
gift to A&M, what would it be for? Core. To do what?

11:13.753 --> 11:15.135
Recruitment. To use for core scholarships and 
recruitment. To pay for tutors and stuff like

11:18.519 --> 11:20.702
that. To convince mom and dad. Their tutoring 
program is starting good. But to convince mom and

11:24.987 --> 11:34.339
dad that if you go there, you're going to get a... 
We've got enough money here to pay for the very best

11:34.623 --> 11:37.946
tutors that are going to come in to these kids and do 
it. Because that's the biggest concern of mom and

11:37.966 --> 11:42.370
dad when they get into the Corps. Not that I think 
the Corps can ever be or should ever be the majority

11:42.551 --> 11:50.919
population of the campus, but I don't ever want it 
to go away. I want there always to be a significant

11:51.019 --> 11:54.802
presence there. And I think if kids that are coming 
here that may want to get in the Corps, that there

11:55.263 --> 12:03.651
are a lot of parents that are going, You know, they 
remember back to my days or before me, and that's

12:04.238 --> 12:09.927
the place where they don't let you study. You ought 
not do it. And I'd put the money into making sure

12:11.630 --> 12:17.399
they had the best academic tutors they could get. 
Allay the fears of mom and daddy. What have we left

12:20.203 --> 12:21.124
out? What topics have we not touched on that we 
should have? Well, I don't know. I can't imagine

12:26.353 --> 12:27.795
anything we missed. All right. I've got then one 
last question. What feelings do you hold in your

12:30.513 --> 12:34.377
heart for Texas A&M today? Nothing but good. I do 
wish I could get the students to vote for one

12:36.800 --> 12:46.551
Democrat every now

12:36.800 --> 12:46.551
and then. But I have nothing but warm feelings. I 
believe that whatever little I have accomplished

12:57.867 --> 13:00.570
I would have done none of it had I not had the 
experience at A&M. I believe that. I don't think, I

13:02.232 --> 13:14.385
don't think, I think if I had never gone to A&M, I 
would never have been a railroad commissioner, a

13:02.232 --> 13:14.385
comptroller of public accounts, a state senator, 
or a state representative. I don't believe that

13:14.665 --> 13:15.646
would happen. Not just because it wound up helping 
me get elected, but because the experiences led me

13:16.787 --> 13:23.795
that way to begin with. That's a good conclusion.
