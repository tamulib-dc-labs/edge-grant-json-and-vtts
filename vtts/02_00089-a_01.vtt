WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:05.113
And that will interrupt us every once in a while. 
This is August the 2nd. We're in the MSC and I have

00:07.306 --> 00:23.210
the honor and pleasure of chatting with Mrs. 
Rachel Gonzalez about her memories of being a very

00:07.306 --> 00:23.210
proud and loyal Aggie wife and mother. Say a 
sentence or two and let's chat. Just to check this.

00:28.658 --> 00:33.025
Yeah, I am a very proud Aggie mom and mother.

00:35.452 --> 00:44.395
To begin with, please tell this machine to 
acquaint someone who might hear this or read it

00:35.452 --> 00:44.395
many years in the future. Describe your family 
background, parents, where they grew up, Well, my

00:49.205 --> 00:51.748
father came from Durango, Mexico. He was educated 
in a Methodist school from pre-kinder all the way

00:51.788 --> 00:57.715
up through college. He had a degree in public 
accounting, and he came to Texas in 1915 when he was

00:58.396 --> 01:11.972
run out of Mexico by Pancho Villa. He came to and got 
acquainted with some people that knew Mr. Saurus

01:11.952 --> 01:26.991
Lucas who had a big ranch and owned a lot of land, 
owned the Berkley and had a mercantile. And my

01:30.958 --> 01:38.711
father, who was an accountant, got a job as the bank 
accountant and the manager of the Berclair

01:30.958 --> 01:38.711
Mercantile. And that's where he met my mother, who 
was living in Berclair. and her education was a

01:45.787 --> 02:09.583
private done at home by tutors because there was no 
public school in the motel and so my grandfather

01:45.787 --> 02:09.583
had tutors from Goliad come in and I would say she 
may have gone up to the eighth grade got an eighth

01:45.787 --> 02:09.583
grade education and that's where he she met my 
father they got married and We had a family of 14.

02:13.206 --> 02:17.435
They lived next door to my grandfather and 
grandmother.

02:20.242 --> 02:21.444
What about your father's family? Where did they 
come from? My father's family was from Durango,

02:22.767 --> 02:25.293
Mexico. They stayed in Durango. Oh, so both your 
mother and father? Were from Durango? No. Oh, I'm

02:32.045 --> 02:33.126
sorry. My mother's all family were from Goliad. 
Oh, I'm sorry. My grandmother was born inside the

02:38.772 --> 02:50.382
mission, La Bahia Mission, and that's where she 
was baptized and had her confirmation, was

02:38.772 --> 02:50.382
married, and was buried from that mission. How 
many generations had they lived there? Do you

02:52.945 --> 02:53.365
know? Oh, well, I guess all their... by four or five 
generations because uh my grandmother

02:59.429 --> 03:27.529
originally the people all her people were from 
goliad around lava hill so they may be older your

02:59.429 --> 03:27.529
family may predate texas as a state that's on that 
side of the thing on my mother's side of the family

02:59.429 --> 03:27.529
grandmother's side of the family my father's 
family and when he came to the united states they

02:59.429 --> 03:27.529
remained in mexico My grandmother, my father's 
mother, was a widow. Her husband had died in their

03:34.582 --> 03:38.498
own minds, but She doesn't know how she signed 
those mines over to a lawyer. And, of course, she

03:45.260 --> 03:50.807
was well taken care of, and her children all were 
educated. Like I said, they were educated in a

03:50.827 --> 04:05.245
Methodist missionary school, because these 
missionaries had come from England to Durango,

03:50.827 --> 04:05.245
established that school, and that's where my 
father got all his education. And during Pancho

04:05.225 --> 04:14.593
Villa's time, he was an officer in the Mexican 
army, so then Pancho Villa captured him. And my

04:15.586 --> 04:22.775
grandmother, knowing Panchavilla's mother, 
appealed to her. And then one of my father's

04:22.895 --> 04:35.450
cousins, first cousin, joined Panchavilla's 
army because he had four sisters, just like my

04:22.895 --> 04:35.450
father had five sisters and he had four sisters. 
And usually Panchavilla would come into a town and

04:36.231 --> 04:41.978
take, and the soldiers would take advantage of the 
women. And so that way, His cousin joined

04:44.392 --> 04:48.929
Panchayat's army so that- To protect the sisters. 
To protect the sisters and the cousins. But my dad

04:52.036 --> 04:56.801
was captured by Pancho Villa because he was in the 
Mexican Army. And so through this cousin and

04:56.981 --> 05:08.712
through my grandmother's appeal to Pancho Villa, 
he told them that he would not execute him, but he

04:56.981 --> 05:08.712
had to get out of the country. And that's when my 
daddy came to San Antonio, and eventually he wound

05:08.832 --> 05:19.242
up as a bookkeeper and accountant for Mr. Cyrus 
Lucas in Berclair. Do you have any idea why he came

05:19.390 --> 05:23.838
to San Antonio instead of some other town? Well, 
usually all those people that were being put out by

05:23.858 --> 05:30.670
Pancho Villa usually would end up in San Antonio. 
And he was sitting in the hotel lobby of the Blue

05:30.710 --> 05:43.373
Bunny Hotel in San Antonio, and Mr. Lucas had room 
there when he would go do business with the banks in

05:30.710 --> 05:43.373
San Antonio. And the man that had driven him there 
was his manager of one of the big ranches. And he got

05:51.859 --> 05:57.426
to talking to my dad and asked my father, how do you 
know English so well? And I told him and he said,

05:57.526 --> 06:03.373
well, you know, he said, we're here, we're looking 
for cowboys. And my dad said, well, I can, I know how

06:03.514 --> 06:10.322
to ride a horse because he knew how to, says I can do 
that. So that's when he told Mr. Lucas, well, I got

06:10.302 --> 06:18.826
you a ranch hand, a cowboy, and took him to the 
ranch. And then the man realized that my dad didn't

06:18.886 --> 06:23.299
know how to cut cattle. But in talking to him, my dad 
showed him all his credentials. So he said, you

06:27.959 --> 06:34.428
know, Mr. Lucas is looking for a bookkeeper, and 
I'm going to tell him about you. So he had an

06:35.890 --> 06:39.215
interview with Mr. Lucas, and he hired him. And he 
worked for him until 19...

06:47.157 --> 06:55.489
Well, after Mr. Lucas died, he kept with his son, 
Mr. Pryor Lucas, and then with his daughter, Mr.

06:47.157 --> 06:55.489
Lucas's daughter. They too had big ranches, and he 
had all those accounts and everything. So my dad

06:59.375 --> 07:05.824
stayed with that family as an accountant until 
1948. I think in 1945 he opened up his own

07:06.952 --> 07:12.781
accounting business in Beeville. And of course he 
kept the Lucas's accounts, but he got more

07:13.762 --> 07:27.743
accounts like the drugstores in Beeville and 
several businesses and of course income tax time

07:13.762 --> 07:27.743
he... Now your parents met in... In Beauclair. In 
Beauclair. And that's where they lived for a

07:29.817 --> 07:32.540
while. We lived there until 1945. 1946 they moved 
to Beeville. Did you start school in Beauclair? We

07:39.467 --> 07:50.959
went to school, elementary school in Beauclair, 
and I, we didn't have a high school, I mean, there

07:39.467 --> 07:50.959
was a high school, but it was only for Anglos. And 
the Mexican school was up to the seventh grade, and

07:52.421 --> 07:59.048
also the black school. But there was no way we could 
go to high school, but my father would, my two older

08:00.260 --> 08:13.374
brothers, three older brothers would room and 
board in Beeville, and they went to high school

08:00.260 --> 08:13.374
there, and from there they came to A&M. But I didn't 
know, my father didn't know what he was gonna do

08:14.535 --> 08:25.187
with me, because he didn't want me to room and board 
where I didn't know anybody. But Mrs. R.A. Hall,

08:25.538 --> 08:38.636
whose husband was the superintendent of the 
Experiment Station, A&M Experiment and BUL, was a

08:25.538 --> 08:38.636
homemaking teacher and she had taught my brothers 
and knew my family. So she said that she could keep

08:38.917 --> 08:44.625
me at her house and I could go to school with her. And 
I lived with her four years. I lived in their home

08:49.391 --> 08:52.035
four years while going to school. Right now the, 
forgive me for this naivete, in Beeville there was

08:52.150 --> 08:59.017
only one high school? No. Oh, there was a separate? 
Separate school. For Hispanic? For Hispanic, the

09:02.601 --> 09:06.525
Westside High School, and that's where my 
brothers graduated. It was in my sophomore year of

09:07.526 --> 09:21.280
1940, 1938, 39.

09:22.576 --> 09:25.524
that we were integrated into the high school. And I 
graduated from A.C. Jones High School in 1941.

09:29.616 --> 09:32.103
About how many in your senior class? Oh, I would say 
there were about 80. And among your brothers and

09:35.941 --> 09:39.825
sisters, you're number what? Number four. You're 
number four. Or the 14. And growing up at home, did

09:43.349 --> 09:47.214
you all speak English or Spanish? We spoke both 
English and Spanish. And it was so funny because we

09:50.437 --> 09:53.921
did the studying. The cooking was done in my 
grandmother's house because she lived next door.

09:59.347 --> 10:02.196
And we did the studying there. She had a great big 
old piano, almost as big as this, this grand piano

10:02.257 --> 10:11.668
that had this black big in the living room. And we 
would get on top of that and we would study. She had a

10:16.065 --> 10:27.163
table in the dining room and if our writing was not 
done right or she thought it was messy or

10:16.065 --> 10:27.163
something, she said, you made too many mistakes. 
You have to do your work over again. We didn't

10:29.386 --> 10:33.032
realize that she didn't know how to read English. 
But just because of the writing and the messy

10:33.012 --> 10:38.459
paper, we had to do over again. And she and my 
grandfather were very instrumental in helping my

10:38.680 --> 10:45.689
mother and father go to school. As you were growing 
up, did you understand that girls were to be just as

10:45.709 --> 10:53.880
educated as boys? Well, no, because a lot of my 
cousins We were about the same age because my

10:59.978 --> 11:10.297
grandmother had an adopted daughter and then she 
had a daughter, my mother and another daughter.

11:10.998 --> 11:14.084
And their children were kind of about the same age 
as we were. But they, as soon as they got to the

11:15.106 --> 11:19.654
seventh grade, they didn't pursue anyway. It was 
through my father that... He said that we all had to

11:22.422 --> 11:25.027
be educated. Well, that's what I was meaning. In 
your family, with your parents, yes, you were

11:25.888 --> 11:28.753
going to be. I mean, there was no, they said, well, 
we're going to quit or we're going to stop or we're

11:28.774 --> 11:34.424
not going to go to school. That never did enter our 
mind because my father and mother were, and my

11:34.484 --> 11:43.941
grandmother and grandfather were very 
persistent that we went to school. And do you

11:43.988 --> 11:48.532
remember which language you learned first? 
Spanish. Spanish first. Spanish first. Because I

11:52.737 --> 11:57.321
certainly don't detect an accent in your English. 
Well, by the time we were going to school, we knew

11:57.581 --> 12:01.625
English. And we could, you know, understand. All 
right, so you graduate from high school in

12:07.151 --> 12:09.753
Beeville. In Beeville. And when do you start 
getting letters from this young man that's in the

12:11.090 --> 12:15.420
Air Force? Well, I went on to college, San Antonio 
College, and I got a teaching certificate because

12:15.581 --> 12:28.913
he was doing the war, and they needed teachers, and 
they needed a teacher there in my little hometown,

12:15.581 --> 12:28.913
and my father said, Well, you need to get a teaching 
certificate and come teach. We need somebody to

12:35.672 --> 12:37.174
teach. I was teaching the first and second grade, 
and then they went home at 3 o'clock, and then I

12:37.194 --> 12:46.327
taught social studies to the seventh grade. This 
is in Berkeley. In Berkeley. And then a job came

12:49.792 --> 12:58.444
open at the Experiment Station for a secretary. 
and he'd pay more. So I went to, because I was

13:00.634 --> 13:08.206
helping with some of the family, because we had 
some in high school, some in college. So I went to

13:09.448 --> 13:19.945
work at the Experiment Station, and that's when I 
got a letter from Ralph, which was like in 1944. I

13:20.005 --> 13:26.575
think 44 or 43,

13:20.005 --> 13:26.575
I believe. Because I went to the University of 
Mexico that summer, and I remember writing

13:27.618 --> 13:37.471
letters to all different, some of our hometown 
boys that were in the service. And I know I was

13:38.954 --> 13:43.700
writing to Richard Bazan, who was stationed with 
Ralph. And I was writing to, well, about four or

13:45.122 --> 13:54.655
five of the boys that were overseas that we knew, 
the families knew each other. And so I was writing,

13:54.854 --> 14:01.632
I wrote Ralph a letter and told him all about me, and 
we just kept writing. And when I came home from the

14:01.712 --> 14:09.994
University of Mexico, like I said, I was working at 
the Experiment Station, and that was in 45. And I

14:11.307 --> 14:17.537
kept on writing to Ralph and the other people. 
Well, the girls that he, because he was writing to

14:18.078 --> 14:23.607
five of the girls in BUL. So Charlotte Murray and I 
kept writing to him, and we kept a race of who was

14:24.167 --> 14:34.564
going to be the last one, I mean, the first one to 
quit. So I don't know why Charlotte put a write-in

14:35.236 --> 14:40.562
to him, but I kept on, you know, writing. Did you all 
exchange pictures? Yes. Letters and pictures.

14:44.066 --> 14:45.829
Letters and pictures. And so when war was over in, 
well, I had visited with his mother before, during

14:45.849 --> 14:58.864
1945, because he had been over there since 42. and 
had not come home. And I remember the first time I

15:00.828 --> 15:08.279
walked into her living room, the Christmas tree 
was up and it was like in April. And she said, I've

15:09.241 --> 15:15.270
been keeping that Christmas tree because Ralph's 
been writing that he's been, will come home

15:09.241 --> 15:15.270
Christmas. And he said in 44, he didn't come home. 
And I'm hoping that this year he will come. Well,

15:21.639 --> 15:26.325
then war with Germany was over and then the war with 
Japan. And so he was coming home and he wrote and

15:26.365 --> 15:31.652
said that he would like to meet me. So we didn't have 
transportation, but the Greyhound, I mean, we had

15:32.874 --> 15:40.103
a car, but we, I didn't, we just had only two cars. My 
brother, oldest brother had a car and my father had

15:40.303 --> 15:43.768
a car. So I rode the bus to San Antonio because I had 
an aunt that lived there. And whenever we went to

15:48.435 --> 15:52.682
San Antonio, we stayed at her home. So I wrote her 
and told her that this young man was picking me up

15:53.503 --> 16:01.656
and taking me to her house. recognized me right 
away and of course let himself known and he took me

16:01.771 --> 16:29.533
to my aunt's house then he took me to his house his 
mother had prepared a meal and and no i think he took

16:01.771 --> 16:29.533
me to a cafe yeah that's the second time we went to 
sleep he took me to a cafe and we had dinner and i

16:01.771 --> 16:29.533
think we went to him we went to a movie and then he 
took me home to my aunt And then the next day he

16:29.513 --> 16:48.360
picked me up and we went over to his house and that's 
when we had a Sunday dinner at his house and he took

16:29.513 --> 16:48.360
me back to my aunt and I picked up my things and my 
suitcase and he took me to the bus station and I went

16:29.513 --> 16:48.360
home. And then he came to visit my family and the 
third time he came that's when he asked Oh. Now,

16:57.272 --> 17:01.160
what did your family think at first about your 
writing to these boys? Well, my dad knew that

17:01.842 --> 17:06.592
because, you know, the mayor came to his office. 
And he knew I was writing to all these boys because

17:07.394 --> 17:13.106
it was, you know, the thing to do. Patriotic. Yeah. 
But he didn't, I mean, there was nothing. We'd just

17:17.581 --> 17:20.405
write about what was happening in the family. And, 
of course, David, it was David Alanis, and he was

17:20.465 --> 17:27.174
taken prisoner in Germany. And, you know, the 
families just were close together. Is there

17:32.942 --> 17:38.990
anything that you have teased him about since then 
that he didn't tell you about in advance? Oh, I

17:41.434 --> 17:42.535
don't know. what it be okay I don't I don't think I 
think he told everything and then his mother would

17:43.848 --> 18:12.032
great so now that's in the fall of 45 that's in 
October I think we he came home in October 45 is he

17:43.848 --> 18:12.032
discharged yes okay he's discharged and we got 
married in December right and what did you at that

17:43.848 --> 18:12.032
point what did you think he was going to do 
professionally Well, he had worked for Milam

18:17.024 --> 18:24.334
Chevrolet, and he had the job back. I mean, that was 
the understanding when he went in the service that

18:24.554 --> 18:31.283
Mr. Freeman would give him the job back. So he had a 
job with Mr. Freeman in the parts department, and

18:31.343 --> 18:42.998
we got married and went on our honeymoon, and when 
we got back, he went to work. with Mr., at Milam

18:43.822 --> 18:46.706
Chevrolet. And then in September, we got married 
in December. September 29th, we had our son, and he

18:53.354 --> 19:01.604
kept working at Milam, but then Smith Motor Sales 
offered him a better job. So he went to work in the

19:02.305 --> 19:07.772
parts department at Smith's as part salesman. And 
we, that's when we bought our home. What part of San

19:14.467 --> 19:16.411
Antonio? In Palm Heights, what was called Palm 
Heights. Had you quit teaching? Yes. I was a

19:24.446 --> 19:26.630
homemaker. I was staying home with my son. And so we 
bought the home in 1946.

19:34.953 --> 19:42.442
And we furnished it, and we were doing pretty good. 
Better than a lot of them, because my husband had a

19:42.802 --> 19:46.106
steady job. But then my two brothers had graduated 
from A&M, and then Bert and Carlos were here. And so

19:57.399 --> 20:01.264
he wanted to go on to school, Carlos talked him into 
trying A&M, so we came up here to find out what he

20:09.412 --> 20:13.700
needed and they told him he had to take the 
chemistry and the math in the summertime. So that

20:13.740 --> 20:21.694
summer we got busy and we decided what we were going 
to sell, what furniture we were going to sell and

20:13.740 --> 20:21.694
what to keep. Well, they let us know that we 
couldn't have housing at A&M that year. So I was

20:26.964 --> 20:33.175
telling my parents and they said, well, stay with 
us the first year. So we sold, we decided what

20:33.155 --> 20:40.306
furnish to sell and we sold the house and I think we 
sold it with a stove and a refrigerator. And

20:40.366 --> 20:49.319
stove, refrigerator and the couch and the living 
room furniture. We kept the dining room table and

20:49.399 --> 20:57.171
the chairs because that was kind of like an antique 
that I had gotten. And we kept one bedroom, no, we

20:57.151 --> 21:03.863
kept the bedroom furniture. And my brother in 
Berkeley had a vacant room in his home, so we put our

21:04.364 --> 21:13.641
bedroom furniture in there. And the dining table, 
my mother kept it in her living room because it was a

21:14.583 --> 21:20.410
drop-leaf table. She said, we can always use it 
because we had a long table in the dining room, but

21:20.430 --> 21:27.698
when we had more family, well, we could use it. So I 
stayed with them a year and did substitute, and my

21:28.559 --> 21:33.144
sister was teaching in Berclair. And so I did 
substitute in there for her and then for some of the

21:34.325 --> 21:38.330
other. There were three, it was a three-teacher 
school. And then he was able to get, he stayed at

21:42.578 --> 21:48.144
Bryan Air Force Base because it's freshman year. 
All right, with that freshman year, when he came up

21:48.765 --> 21:56.934
here to enroll, did he bring the car? Yes. So you 
were without wheels. No, no. Yes, he brought the

22:03.061 --> 22:04.382
car, yeah. That's right. And the baby was three 
years old? he was three well he yeah Ralph came the

22:08.667 --> 22:36.987
first of September and Robert was three on the 29th 
okay uh and you're living with your my parents your

22:08.667 --> 22:36.987
parents uh and uh so you were a stay-at-home mother 
well I did have my father in his office oh oh okay

22:08.667 --> 22:36.987
okay whenever he needed me uh he asked me would you 
know and how often did your husband come home Well,

22:37.625 --> 22:41.733
he tried to come home every weekend, but then every 
other weekend. Then he sold

22:41.753 --> 22:50.571
his car, and we were able to get another one. He came 
home almost every other weekend. And of course,

22:55.122 --> 23:00.750
holidays, we spent some time with his parents in 
San Antonio and the rest with my parents. And then

23:01.390 --> 23:05.376
somehow, some holidays, he would work. I mean, 
Miss Morisette was real good about giving him two

23:05.496 --> 23:12.104
weeks job, make extra money. And we were able to 
make ends meet. And of course, my parents helped a

23:18.372 --> 23:21.216
lot. Then, the end of his freshman year, he found 
out that he had a place and they assigned us to Vet

23:22.546 --> 23:31.146
Village. During that first year, do you remember 
any emergencies where you had to locate him by

23:31.787 --> 23:38.142
telephone? No. When

23:40.701 --> 23:52.775
I was in high school, I had Dr. Lancaster, who was a 
very young man doctor there. And so after I got

23:53.596 --> 23:59.282
married, I kept going back to him. And of course, 
when I got pregnant, he told me I had needed to find

23:59.342 --> 24:06.610
somebody in San Antonio for that. But for checkups 
and everything, Ralph and I would go to him. So when

24:10.595 --> 24:20.109
we started school and I took Robert, our son, for 
shots and things, he didn't charge me. And so he

24:21.051 --> 24:25.958
said, just if you get sick, he gave us the name of a 
doctor. His last name was Smith, Dr. Smith here.

24:30.165 --> 24:32.428
And he says, go to him. But we didn't have any 
emergencies that first. No, I was thinking about

24:39.449 --> 24:44.493
while you were in San Antonio and he was up here. Oh, 
no, in Beeville. I was in Beeville. Yeah, in

24:46.495 --> 24:48.056
Beeville. Did you ever have to? No. Okay, because I 
thought he didn't have a telephone in his room. And

24:56.944 --> 25:01.808
do you remember what Christmas was like that first 
year when he came home? What did you all do to

25:02.193 --> 25:03.697
celebrate? Well, we were at my parents' home, and 
we just did what we always have done because my

25:04.098 --> 25:14.988
parents always had all the kids. And so we... 
remember that my mother helped me with buying

25:18.511 --> 25:43.084
things for Robert and my grandmother who was had 
had a stroke when we just before we got married and

25:18.511 --> 25:43.084
my mother kept her in a hospital bed in fact they 
lived they built a bedroom and bathroom for her in

25:18.511 --> 25:43.084
Beeville and she was

25:44.819 --> 25:53.812
Robert was very dear to her because it was not the 
first great grandchild, but she just fell. And so

25:54.353 --> 25:58.479
we always celebrated Christmas with her. And in 
that summer, before we came up here to Red Village,

25:58.519 --> 26:05.609
that's when she passed away. And...

26:09.980 --> 26:14.206
That was one of the saddest things because Robert 
was so used to her. And it was the Fourth of July

26:15.348 --> 26:21.256
weekend and we were going to spend it in Beeville. 
Robert Ralph had gotten a job with Smith Motor

26:21.576 --> 26:26.223
Sales in the parts for the summer. And we were going 
to spend it in Beeville and she was waiting for him.

26:31.450 --> 26:38.400
And finally she said, I just wish Robert would get, 
they would get here. because she wanted to see him,

26:38.887 --> 26:42.011
but she died. We were leaving San Antonio that 
evening, but she died about 2 o'clock. I mean, she

26:47.859 --> 26:49.201
just had another. All right. And during that year 
when you were down there by yourself, I believe he

26:51.324 --> 26:58.053
said he sent you money? Yes, out of his paycheck. So 
what was your budget, your spending budget? Well,

27:02.639 --> 27:05.383
he would send me, I think it was $60. A month? A 
month. And I would give my mother, I insisted on

27:09.194 --> 27:18.748
paying and my mother wouldn't think about it, but I 
think I gave my mother $30. And I kept 30 and out of

27:19.538 --> 27:43.880
that 30 we budgeted to buy, you know, clothes and if 
we had to, of course the drugstore, Daddy had to

27:19.538 --> 27:43.880
account for Joe and Joe was very good to us, the 
pharmacist, because he was a friend and he would

27:19.538 --> 27:43.880
always do discount on our medication or whatever 
we needed. All right, and as you're getting ready

27:43.900 --> 27:46.963
to move into Vet Village, Did y'all call it Vet, 
what did y'all call it? Vet Village. You called it

27:50.681 --> 27:51.622
Vet Village. Did you have any choice or did they 
assign you to? No, they assigned you, we were

27:57.570 --> 28:04.619
assigned a two-little bedroom and living area and 
kitchen. Describe that apartment. Well, it was

28:07.160 --> 28:10.407
just like this, maybe a little larger. It was just a 
barracks that was divided in half, had a wall, and

28:10.467 --> 28:17.242
it had two bedrooms in the back. Then he had a living 
room in an open place where they had a little dining

28:18.023 --> 28:27.784
table in the kitchen and a place for your washing 
machine. It had deep sinks because you used your

28:27.764 --> 28:33.313
washing machine there. It was a roll-type washing 
machine, and you used the sinks to rinse the

28:33.433 --> 28:38.140
clothes. We moved there. Of course, we had the 
two-bedroom furniture that we moved. in we had the

28:46.900 --> 29:14.038
washing machine and it was furnished with a stove 
and refrigerator in the dining table and so uh we uh

28:46.900 --> 29:14.038
they had a kind of like a day bed but it what it was it 
was just a kind of like a cot with a wooden and it had a

28:46.900 --> 29:14.038
mattress and i fixed it to where it looked like a 
couch for the living room I think we had a rocking

29:14.963 --> 29:21.791
chair that we brought from home and another little 
living room chair. And we moved in. When they

29:25.115 --> 29:30.101
assigned it, they wrote him and told him. So we came 
up one weekend and cleaned it out. I mean, did

29:33.004 --> 29:38.811
everything and put little curtains and got it all 
fixed up. Then we moved the furniture before

29:38.871 --> 29:41.494
school started. And when we got through finishing 
and school started, then the neighbors, Helen,

29:42.554 --> 29:53.811
Darren, and... D-A-R-R. D-A-R-I-E-N. I believe 
we have it on there. Okay. And Lippincott. I can't

29:59.539 --> 30:01.522
think of her first name. And Francis Cantrell. 
They were already there. And Mary and Nance, they

30:07.107 --> 30:11.976
were already there. And so they came in and 
welcomed us home. And we would, in the evening, of

30:16.464 --> 30:21.353
course school started in And we were getting the 
kids up like feeding them breakfast and getting

30:22.953 --> 30:48.437
them ready and they would go out and play and we'd 
clean the little place and we'd straighten it out

30:22.953 --> 30:48.437
and then in the evening we would sit outside on the 
grass across and we'd talk about the family and the

30:22.953 --> 30:48.437
kids would play and We did washing and of course 
ironing. The washing, we were, every time we wore,

30:53.779 --> 31:03.085
well we were assigned days to hang the clothes out 
because I think four or five families used the same

31:03.554 --> 31:07.818
clothesline. So there wasn't enough space for 
everybody. No. So you had to ask them if you had

31:10.721 --> 31:19.650
washing to do and you wanted to do it a certain day, 
you would ask them to trade with you. So it was a lot

31:20.511 --> 31:22.313
of fun doing that. And, of course, we joined the 
First Baptist Church as soon as we got in and joined

31:22.373 --> 31:29.080
WMU. And we attended Sunday school. And then Ralph 
was an usher.
