WEBVTT

00:03.575 --> 00:20.979
to use our experience as a launching platform 
where perhaps we might

00:03.575 --> 00:20.979
reach an even higher level of achievement in the 
future.

00:31.574 --> 00:32.535
It was at that It was at the last of those three 
commencements on Saturday morning that Dr.

00:33.612 --> 00:48.426
Miller failed to shake hands with Melanie 
Zentgraf.

00:54.251 --> 01:01.037
An action dash or lack thereof dash on his part 
which would later be thrust at him by the Board of

01:02.705 --> 01:11.938
Regents less than two months later.

01:35.898 --> 02:00.471
In the 70s, I continued to speak at Musters and many 
other A&M related events, such as former student

01:35.898 --> 02:00.471
meetings in various Texas communities and A&M 
Mothers Club sessions as well.

02:05.108 --> 02:14.658
Each of those muster were special and quite often 
unique.

02:14.678 --> 02:33.799
For example, at an outdoor session on the beach 
near Galveston, our biggest problems included

02:14.678 --> 02:33.799
the noises of waves

02:14.678 --> 02:33.799
and the constant irritation

02:36.091 --> 02:50.131
of mosquitoes and other bugs.

02:50.171 --> 03:05.372
On another occasion,

02:50.171 --> 03:05.372
at a West Texas muster,

02:50.171 --> 03:05.372
which was intended to be an old-fashioned Texas 
potluck, event where everybody was to bring

03:05.892 --> 03:09.096
something.

03:15.364 --> 03:34.749
Someone forgot to bring plates and tableware

03:15.364 --> 03:34.749
and then they realized that no one had made iced 
tea.

03:34.769 --> 03:35.730
A very special

03:38.900 --> 03:56.446
Aggie memory that could come only at an A&M event 
occurred in one of my early years when I spoke at the

03:38.900 --> 03:56.446
muster in Fort Worth.

04:00.011 --> 04:04.418
Before I was very far into my remarks,

04:11.418 --> 04:20.228
A senior former student called out from the back of 
the room, quote, what kind of Aggie are you? You

04:20.908 --> 04:23.011
didn't even go to school there.

04:28.336 --> 04:39.248
Being challenged with a truly unanticipated 
question, I paused and attempted to escape his

04:41.354 --> 04:58.759
possible scorn

04:41.354 --> 04:58.759
by pointing out that although I had not attended 
A&M,

04:41.354 --> 04:58.759
I was an Aggie by choice.

05:02.245 --> 05:08.053
He sprang to his feet and responded, what the hell 
does that mean?

05:11.088 --> 05:37.011
And I attempted to explain that although I

05:11.088 --> 05:37.011
had not gone to A&M, I had had

05:11.088 --> 05:37.011
other offers of employment at various times, but 
had made the decision to remain there.

05:41.665 --> 06:06.897
And then an idea

05:41.665 --> 06:06.897
popped in my brain, which I voiced when I looked at 
him and said, but I have understood that some

05:41.665 --> 06:06.897
people didn't have a choice about whether or not 
they attended A&M.

06:12.462 --> 06:14.684
Back on his feet, this time with a smile.

06:18.968 --> 06:19.268
He. Agreed.

06:24.113 --> 06:25.094
Quote you're right. In the fall of 28. My dad called 
me into our house on a farm. Up near Jacksboro.

06:38.066 --> 06:40.748
And told me I could stay there that fall. and pick 
cotton,

06:41.707 --> 06:51.678
or I could go to College Station and maybe they'd 
straighten me out."

06:55.482 --> 07:08.997
Period quote.

07:10.748 --> 07:34.803
A&M club meetings,

07:10.748 --> 07:34.803
former student club meetings, Aggie Mothers 
sessions,

07:10.748 --> 07:34.803
meeting with high school counselors when they 
came to the campus,

07:10.748 --> 07:34.803
and many other appearances of that sort. Now in 
hindsight,

07:45.983 --> 08:11.046
appear to have been, appear

07:45.983 --> 08:11.046
to have been excellent

07:45.983 --> 08:11.046
preparation for

07:45.983 --> 08:11.046
the off-campus responsibilities of a senior 
academic administrator, especially a campus

07:45.983 --> 08:11.046
CEO.

08:16.898 --> 08:31.254
I remember going to Aggie Fish Camp almost every 
year at their gathering at a Methodist youth

08:16.898 --> 08:31.254
retreat not far from Palestine.

08:35.238 --> 08:40.324
My normal assignment was to try to explain

08:44.168 --> 09:07.256
the philosophy of land grant education

08:44.168 --> 09:07.256
and Texas A&M's

08:44.168 --> 09:07.256
role

08:44.168 --> 09:07.256
in meeting the challenges of the Morrill Act, 
M-O-R-R-I-L-L.

09:11.241 --> 09:12.302
In those remarks,

09:16.096 --> 09:33.594
I attempted to emphasize that the Morrill Act 
passed by the Federal Congress in 1862 was adopted

09:16.096 --> 09:33.594
by the Texas legislature in the early 1870s.

09:37.478 --> 09:42.863
And then those

09:37.478 --> 09:42.863
representatives and senators

09:45.290 --> 10:04.509
identified Brazos County as the location for the 
Agricultural Mechanical College of Texas, the

09:45.290 --> 10:04.509
first public institution in the Lone Star State.

10:04.529 --> 10:15.280
I tried to

10:04.529 --> 10:15.280
assure these incoming students that the federal 
Act

10:15.749 --> 10:45.250
mandated that all

10:15.749 --> 10:45.250
land grant schools must offer preparation in 
agriculture,

10:15.749 --> 10:45.250
comma, quote, the mechanic arts, quote, which I 
always interpreted as in today's lingo as

10:45.550 --> 11:05.883
engineering and technology,

10:45.550 --> 11:05.883
comma, and military instruction, which today we 
label as ROTC training.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.334
Then I was very careful to try to proceed beyond 
that and to indicate that in no way did the Morrill

11:13.546 --> 11:33.031
Act limit land-grant schools to only those three 
areas of opportunity.

11:33.051 --> 11:42.844
And I tried to make

11:33.051 --> 11:42.844
these incoming freshmen aware that Texas A&M 
hoped to be far

11:44.343 --> 12:02.469
more inclusive and was on its way

11:44.343 --> 12:02.469
and was striving to add to its breadth and depth 
every year.

12:06.155 --> 12:13.185
Fish Camp, quote, paragraph, Fish Camp always 
seemed to be a very meaningful

12:15.663 --> 12:27.562
and splendid introduction to incoming freshmen 
from all backgrounds with a wide variety of goals.

12:28.925 --> 12:40.303
Male and female, civilian and corps,

12:28.925 --> 12:40.303
urban, rural, domestic and international,

12:44.249 --> 13:07.810
Similarly, when they left

12:44.249 --> 13:07.810
the two or three days of fish camp,

12:44.249 --> 13:07.810
there seemed to be already a foundation of

12:44.249 --> 13:07.810
spirit and togetherness.

13:14.236 --> 13:20.063
held together by an increasing flow of 
maroon-tinted blood.

13:26.811 --> 13:42.150
Another of those bonding events, of course, was 
Bonfire,

13:26.811 --> 13:42.150
which in our first years was held In the early 60s on 
the drill field. And then moved over to the area

13:49.241 --> 13:57.854
south of Duncan Dining Hall.

13:57.874 --> 13:58.875
Students worked on. That

13:58.935 --> 14:04.544
on building that stack of logs.

14:08.930 --> 14:09.471
To be. Ignited the night before. Home games with 
the Longhorns.

14:17.879 --> 14:19.461
Or on Tuesday night. If the game was in Austin.

14:29.951 --> 14:32.073
The stacks did not seem very high.

14:35.036 --> 14:38.539
Back.

14:38.559 --> 14:39.340
View from.

14:42.678 --> 14:49.806
the elevation of the night bonfires in the late 
1990s.

15:01.159 --> 15:02.440
Students worked there. And those of us who lived in 
the area and had fireplaces would quite often go

15:05.063 --> 15:12.111
over a day or two after bonfire was over and cut up

15:14.538 --> 15:43.617
the remainder of the small timber that had been 
left out of the big stack

15:14.538 --> 15:43.617
and towed it home

15:14.538 --> 15:43.617
very much with the permission and encouragement 
of campus authorities who were grateful not to

15:44.305 --> 15:50.793
have to haul that rubbish to a landfill.

15:58.763 --> 16:13.941
Paragraph, during those same years I

15:58.763 --> 16:13.941
felt an increasing obligation

15:58.763 --> 16:13.941
as I rose in

16:18.106 --> 16:30.201
in responsibility on the campus to become even 
more involved in the community.

16:34.145 --> 16:48.062
This particularly included

16:34.145 --> 16:48.062
service at the First Presbyterian Church in Bryan 
as a deacon and elder and for a number of years as a

16:34.145 --> 16:48.062
Sunday school class. as Sunday school class 
teacher.

16:54.326 --> 17:14.218
We had a very, a group that gathered early in the 
1960s

16:54.326 --> 17:14.218
of young couples

16:54.326 --> 17:14.218
with an apparent, almost uncountable sum of

17:17.860 --> 17:22.765
children from infants into elementary school.

17:25.669 --> 17:41.286
As we organized that group, we made one 
congregationally

17:25.669 --> 17:41.286
impolitic decision when we named ourselves the

17:46.008 --> 17:48.211
Okay, gonna stop and look at peaches.

17:52.819 --> 18:00.270
Had to stop east of Fredericksburg to buy some 
peaches at an orchard run, believe it or not, by a

17:52.819 --> 18:00.270
German. His name is George Peel, P-E-H-L.

18:06.960 --> 18:14.412
Somehow, somebody I think could make some fun out 
of the fact that he was selling that his peaches had

18:15.185 --> 18:25.657
peelings or that they were,

18:15.185 --> 18:25.657
he grew them and therefore they had been peeled.

18:34.588 --> 18:43.538
That impolitic

18:34.588 --> 18:43.538
step we made was to name our Sunday school class the 
young couples class.

18:46.471 --> 18:52.979
Most of us were well below the age of 35 years or so. 
And

18:52.999 --> 19:15.448
therefore, we did not anticipate the frustration

18:52.999 --> 19:15.448
and clear disappointment

18:52.999 --> 19:15.448
by some older married folks who attended who

19:17.403 --> 19:36.742
were members of, quote, the couples class, quote,

19:17.403 --> 19:36.742
because they thought we were deliberately trying 
to infer that they were old and we were young.

19:39.665 --> 19:40.166
Paragraph.

19:43.229 --> 19:46.752
In that Sunday school group of friends, were a 
number of folks who would become true life

19:47.609 --> 20:00.464
acquaintances and who we would count as among our 
closest friends forever.

20:03.888 --> 20:12.418
As my wife and others often said, we had the joy of 
being poor and raising children together.

20:18.524 --> 20:22.168
Another similar paragraph. Another community 
experience was to serve on the board of the City

20:22.188 --> 20:32.958
National Bank

20:22.188 --> 20:32.958
in Bryan.

20:36.802 --> 20:48.413
That relationship came almost entirely because 
of

20:36.802 --> 20:48.413
our acquaintance with Bookman Peters.

20:51.295 --> 21:09.724
whom I first remember encountering in the hallway 
of the First Presbyterian Church one day in Bryan,

20:51.295 --> 21:09.724
one day between Sunday school and worship 
service. He was then at the first bank and trust in

21:09.744 --> 21:18.518
Bryan, and he urged me to consider moving our 
account downtown.

21:27.516 --> 21:47.425
I tried to remind him

21:27.516 --> 21:47.425
that I was only an instructor

21:27.516 --> 21:47.425
and certainly our account would not make much 
profit for any financial institution.

21:50.290 --> 21:59.644
He optimistically predicted that I would not 
always be at that rank.

21:59.664 --> 22:03.229
And his encouragement led me to move the account. 
Then when his family purchased the city national,

22:04.951 --> 22:12.522
we moved our account there. And then in the 70s, I 
was honored to be invited to join the board of that

22:14.405 --> 22:19.993
bank.

22:23.197 --> 22:24.739
Paragraph now in hindsight. One of the most. Now in 
sad hindsight, one of the most memorable. Events.

22:36.294 --> 22:36.715
Of that. Community involvement. Was the day when 
we? Voted. To accept what seemed to be a very

22:44.785 --> 22:49.351
generous stock swap merger offer. Between the 
City National Bank. of Bryan and the First City

22:53.977 --> 22:58.661
National Bank of Houston.

23:01.444 --> 23:15.497
We had other offers at that time from the Republic

23:01.444 --> 23:15.497
Bank and the Mercantile National Bank, both of 
Dallas. And as I later told my colleagues, On that

23:22.141 --> 23:33.906
particular day, we couldn't miss by accepting any 
of those three dash

23:22.141 --> 23:33.906
because they all went bankrupt.

23:59.215 --> 23:59.775
In the. Paragraph.

24:09.964 --> 24:13.948
After duck as after Doctor Williams moved up to be 
Chancellor of the system. We sadly did not see.

24:20.053 --> 24:21.134
Very much of him.

24:23.996 --> 24:24.857
And Mrs Williams.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.260
They. Had moved from the. New what we still thought 
of as the new president's house on the South edge of

24:32.965 --> 24:37.730
the campus.

24:41.454 --> 24:43.456
To make that available for. Jarvis and Alma 
Miller. First, I believe they rented.

24:50.023 --> 24:53.968
Accommodations

24:50.023 --> 24:53.968
in College Station.

24:56.631 --> 24:58.753
And then moved to the first floor. of the old Board 
of Regents house just north of Sabeasa

24:59.847 --> 25:22.520
and lived beneath the quarters for the Texas A&M 
Press on the second floor of that old structure.

25:22.540 --> 25:29.010
That peace and quiet

25:22.540 --> 25:29.010
was destroyed one night when Mrs. Williams said 
she heard an A&M campus fireman yelling, y'all get

25:31.302 --> 25:42.332
out, your house is on fire.

25:42.352 --> 25:52.000
They dashed out to their personal safety, but lost 
many of their sentimentally irreplaceable

25:42.352 --> 25:52.000
belongings. The press suffered great damage 
also, even losing much of the original drafts of

26:01.694 --> 26:19.315
the A&M Press mark, which had been created

26:01.694 --> 26:19.315
by Tom Lee, the great El Paso artist.

26:23.579 --> 26:30.047
The press found temporary quarters

26:23.579 --> 26:30.047
in a warehouse, And the Williams moved off campus.

26:37.112 --> 26:40.457
Before too long they relocated to Houston. When 
Doctor Williams became the president of the Texas

26:41.718 --> 26:45.404
Medical Center.

26:50.230 --> 26:51.692
In which he became the.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.300
Cooperation builder. And coordinator. for all of 
the medical

27:01.347 --> 27:26.226
facilities and instructional

27:01.347 --> 27:26.226
institutions in that great conglomeration in 
Houston.

27:26.246 --> 27:29.751
Now, with the benefit of hindsight, I am deeply 
frustrated at myself

27:32.077 --> 27:54.160
that I did not remain in closer contact with that 
one of a kind role model for me as an academic

27:32.077 --> 27:54.160
administrator.

27:57.543 --> 27:59.485
He will always be for me The splendid leader. To 
whom all others will be. Compared.

28:14.310 --> 28:16.634
His passing not long after. His death not long 
after. We moved to El Paso. Was a deep personal

28:20.981 --> 28:23.245
loss.

28:32.438 --> 28:47.917
The board selected Frank Hubert, Dean of 
Education, to replace Dr. Williams as the chief

28:32.438 --> 28:47.917
executive of the system.

28:47.937 --> 29:01.213
So he moved into the

28:47.937 --> 29:01.213
system administration building,

28:47.937 --> 29:01.213
now named the Jack Williams building. on the east 
end of the campus facing Texas Avenue. Soon we

29:09.644 --> 29:29.428
became aware of a deep disagreement between the 
new chancellor and President Miller

29:09.644 --> 29:29.428
over the reporting location

29:09.644 --> 29:29.428
of the various system agencies, including the 
Agricultural and Mechanical

29:30.100 --> 29:48.363
Experiment Stations,

29:30.100 --> 29:48.363
Extension Services and the Texas Forest Service.

29:52.989 --> 29:55.652
Dr. Miller, who as Director of the Agricultural 
Experiment Station had not want to report to the

29:56.257 --> 30:02.946
campus. But now as president, he urged the board to 
place those agencies under his administrative

30:05.009 --> 30:15.725
review.

30:21.072 --> 30:21.673
He had some reason to do so because so much of the 
budget for the colleges of agriculture,

30:23.645 --> 30:43.766
engineering, and veterinary medicine

30:23.645 --> 30:43.766
came from the stations and the services.

30:47.550 --> 30:52.015
Naturally, the heads of those agencies did not 
want to report to the campus

30:55.150 --> 30:55.951
But preferred. To go to the head man. Of the system.

31:04.461 --> 31:06.604
Dr Hubert and his always. Calm.

31:11.109 --> 31:13.372
Quietly determined manner.

31:16.635 --> 31:18.778
Set out to ensure.
