WEBVTT

00:06.730 --> 00:14.322
Can you discuss the time that you spent in Vietnam?

00:15.063 --> 00:20.472
Well, okay, in 65, I went over to the advisor. I 
served with the unit that was very poorly trained.

00:27.863 --> 00:30.467
There were three of us Americans. There was an 
officer. There was two non-commissioned

00:32.802 --> 00:36.907
officers from America, and there was one 
Australian officer. And we advised this infantry

00:38.369 --> 00:41.493
battalion. We were in an area that was very 
critical in defense of the Vietnamese army and of

00:41.513 --> 00:52.908
the territory. We were in the Quang Ngai area, up in 
the I Corps, up where Da Nang and Tam Kee and all

00:52.929 --> 01:02.421
those places are. And that was in what you call a 
tribe country of Vietnamese, Laos, and Cambodian

01:03.076 --> 01:11.505
they met. So we conducted operations around it. 
But remember that some of these Vietnamese

01:17.652 --> 01:25.140
officers were sympathizers with the Viet Cong. 
And so therefore, they wouldn't fight against

01:25.160 --> 01:32.188
their own brother and cousin, just like any horse 
else. uh it's pretty rough for us to live pretty

01:32.995 --> 01:56.455
rough for us to live with those people and advise 
them and then it was even rougher tough for us to be

01:32.995 --> 01:56.455
with them because we'd never know when they're 
putting us out and we'd be killed when we go out in

01:32.995 --> 01:56.455
operation We had to live, sleep with them, and 
everything. We had to follow their costumes. I

02:01.211 --> 02:02.793
went to church with some of them. I went to Catholic 
Mass with them on Sundays. I ate their food. I spoke

02:07.141 --> 02:08.964
their language. I visited their villages. I 
visited their relatives. And I look on in on

02:12.330 --> 02:13.953
myself. So therefore, you know, I had it made in a 
way, you know, and I was real slim in those days.

02:21.173 --> 02:24.378
They were confused. They didn't know if I was a 
Hawaiian or Filipino or what. And at one time I told

02:28.846 --> 02:33.073
them I was a war orphan. And so they believed it. But 
I stayed there and I attended the Bob Hope Prison

02:36.238 --> 02:44.532
Show in 1965.

02:46.992 --> 02:50.657
And then in 1966, I was wounded. I stepped on a 
landmine. I was paralyzed on the way down. I was

02:55.703 --> 02:57.846
declared never to walk again. And then that team 
that I was with was overrun and completely

02:57.866 --> 03:03.553
demolished. None of those people are alive now. 
And I landed in the hospital in the Philippines. I

03:14.046 --> 03:15.548
was in Clark Air Force Base. and I was paralyzed. I 
was declared never to walk again. But I did it.

03:23.422 --> 03:32.115
Thank God, you know, I was a paratrooper, and I was a 
gun-holed airborne ranger and everything. And I

03:32.135 --> 03:35.079
had faith, and I wanted to walk. So I did. After 10 
months of struggling, kneeling and dragging

03:36.140 --> 03:44.893
myself and getting up to a wall, I walked, and I 
walked out of the hospital. And then I went back to

03:52.234 --> 03:58.440
Fort Brand, North Carolina, and I went back to jump 
status, and I made three faster jumps in one day. My

03:59.601 --> 04:00.982
wife thought I was crazy. She was going to divorce 
me and everything. She thought, you know, a bug

04:03.165 --> 04:06.668
done hit my mind. She didn't think I was all there. 
And I went with Special Forces, and I started

04:11.272 --> 04:15.977
training with Special Forces. Then it was known as 
the Green Berets. In 1962, the late President

04:19.689 --> 04:31.225
Kennedy, of course, he observed the training of 
the special forces. And Vietnam was developed and

04:31.245 --> 04:35.571
developed. And of course, Korean classic just 
came about in the Dominican Republic. And the

04:43.401 --> 04:45.424
President thought that his advisors, as I 
understand the story goes, that this was a sort of,

04:47.311 --> 05:16.947
I don't know what they called that, counter 
guerrilla warfare tactic, that we'd have to be

04:47.311 --> 05:16.947
trained and you'd have to have special people in 
this qualification

04:47.311 --> 05:16.947
for training. counterinsurgency and

05:18.175 --> 05:26.007
guerrilla warfare tactics and all. So then he 
thought about the Special Forces. And so

05:29.012 --> 05:34.822
President Kennedy said, hey look, what about 
these Special Forces people? Let's

05:35.583 --> 05:44.136
have them be identified as the Green Berets. And 
that's Let's let the public know that we have

05:45.057 --> 05:54.211
special people trained for the 
counterinsurgency tactic. So then he authorized

05:54.231 --> 05:56.815
us to wear the Green Beret. And then he said that the 
Green Beret was a symbol of excellence, mark of

05:57.776 --> 06:06.149
distinction, badge of courage, and fight for 
freedom. So then we proved it to the world and to

06:07.151 --> 06:14.001
every country that we were assigned to. that we are 
instructors, we're teachers to their militia, to

06:15.010 --> 06:22.161
their military. We're linguists, we're trained.

06:30.153 --> 06:34.299
Someone said that we were a special breed of men. 
Special forces are a special breed of men. We train

06:37.204 --> 06:43.313
in our way to train others. to learn the meaning of 
freedom. And we train them. We know weaponry. We

06:51.426 --> 07:04.345
know operational intelligence, which includes 
meteorology, fingerprinting, interpretation

06:51.426 --> 07:04.345
of photography, interrogation for linguists. We 
know medical training. Some of the medics are

07:08.430 --> 07:11.595
trained almost like doctors. We're trained in 
communications. We can communicate all around

07:14.112 --> 07:20.263
the world in Morse codes and in engineering. We can 
build, destroy. We're trained in

07:23.389 --> 07:30.983
light and heavy weapons. We know every weapon in 
the system. from the BB gun to the 105 holster. We

07:40.136 --> 07:55.278
can operate any weapon, and we can not destroy, but 
we can disassemble and assemble any weapon. And

07:56.079 --> 07:59.404
some of these fellows can assemble them 
blindfolded. That's amazing. So that's what a

08:02.709 --> 08:05.072
special force can do. So, in 1968, then I went back 
again with Special Forces and I was assigned to an

08:05.491 --> 08:24.407
operation intelligence team to gather 
intelligence information of the enemy. I was

08:24.427 --> 08:25.609
trained I didn't have a weapon. I know all about all 
the weapons that I just mentioned. I guess one

08:31.703 --> 08:36.990
thing, it was hard to tell who the enemy was, wasn't 
it? Well, in a way, for the other conventional

08:37.010 --> 08:43.919
soldiers, remember the Special Forces are 
unconventional. We live out there with them. The

08:46.717 --> 08:52.123
conventional soldiers are these other soldiers 
that stayed together. Being here in South Vietnam

08:52.424 --> 08:55.648
and North Vietnam, all of them looked alike. Well, 
that's where the intelligence came in. But you're

09:01.815 --> 09:04.057
right. We didn't know. I had a long story. You hear 
all kinds of stories. I had a couple of boys I went to

09:10.205 --> 09:13.809
high school with served over there. And they said 
that even the young children at times could be your

09:17.007 --> 09:18.570
enemy. A little kid would come up and throw a hand in 
the air. You never know who your enemy was. But they

09:29.888 --> 09:31.170
were wonderful people. And they were confused as 
we were. They were just more confused than we were.

09:38.301 --> 09:39.704
Because they wanted liberty. They wanted 
freedom. But yet their own brothers would not give

09:41.146 --> 09:43.850
it to them. Their own their own cousins that were in 
office. I'm sorry that that pencil went down. It's

09:50.991 --> 09:53.874
not going down. Do you think the Soviets had a lot, 
were behind a lot of it? I think that in some way they

09:59.499 --> 10:03.002
had some influence, yeah. They did, just like they 
have in Cuba. Just like they have in Central

10:08.327 --> 10:12.211
America. Have you ever stopped to think And why 
there's no Hispanic in Saskatoon Central

10:14.652 --> 10:21.519
America? Is it an advisory? No, I never thought 
about that. You know the news? They talk about Army

10:25.964 --> 10:28.587
advisors, right? But they never talk about a 
Hispanic in the Army being an advisor.

10:36.375 --> 10:37.136
Why is it? Come to think about it.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.459
How long did you stay in Vietnam? Well, the first 
time, I stayed five months, almost six.

10:57.253 --> 10:59.155
I was wounded. And the second time, in 1968, I 
stayed almost four months. Is this the time when

11:05.202 --> 11:08.846
you saved the other men? And the second time in 
1968, yes. That was the time that I volunteered for

11:12.432 --> 11:16.078
this mission.

11:18.862 --> 11:20.485
May 2nd, 1968. And this was the time that you 
eventually got the Congressional Medal of Honor,

11:22.167 --> 11:27.035
is that right? Well, I was recommended for the 
medal then. My commander didn't know the full

11:30.500 --> 11:33.825
extent of the operation. And, of course, it was 
so... Excuse me, it was so... The mission was so

11:40.748 --> 11:47.874
classified that I didn't even know about that. I 
didn't know the full extent because those men that

11:48.315 --> 11:58.104
were asking for assistance, they were denied 
assistance. That's how classified the mission

11:58.124 --> 12:01.927
was. There was no helicopter going in there once 
they let them in until after the operation. But

12:10.094 --> 12:35.241
since I was in a different launch area, launch side 
area,

12:10.094 --> 12:35.241
I went up with my helicopter and I asked the forward 
air controller, had been an assistant to us, an

12:10.094 --> 12:35.241
assistant to us, and he said that, you know, that 
we, that he was at loss because he couldn't support

12:35.508 --> 12:42.139
any information. He couldn't support any 
information because there was a secret operation

12:42.159 --> 12:47.327
mission. However, he pinpointed an area where we 
could get to, knowing that these people were in

12:47.347 --> 13:00.469
desire of help, in desire of need of help. You know, 
you just can't neglect your brother. And I'm glad

13:05.051 --> 13:12.801
that that person acknowledged his location. 
However, I can't find him. I don't know him. And

13:16.325 --> 13:18.588
maybe he wants it that way. There's others that 
have changed their name that don't want to be

13:18.628 --> 13:25.296
located because of a sacred mission operation. 
But I'm glad that I that I was able, it could have

13:30.453 --> 13:33.857
been anyone else. A lot of people asked me, why did I 
do it? You know, I couldn't, those people could

13:40.664 --> 13:46.210
have done the same for me. I knew some of the men. In 
fact, I just got a letter

13:49.334 --> 13:54.540
from one of them. It was a pretty tough day. It was a 
day that you can honestly say that you earned your

13:56.221 --> 14:02.910
money. It was very sad.

14:07.315 --> 14:19.652
One of the hardest things for a recipient of the 
Medal of Honor is to know that you wear the medal and

14:07.315 --> 14:19.652
you're able to talk about your experience. That's 
when I wondered if it was really maybe too painful

14:19.852 --> 14:26.160
to talk about, you know. Well, in a way it is, you 
know, but in a way the public has to know. Because

14:32.768 --> 14:42.197
the public has to know.

14:42.217 --> 14:47.101
I tell you what, cut that off.

14:47.121 --> 14:52.766
When were you first nominated or brought up to get 
the Congressional Medal of Honor? Well, 1968.

14:55.823 --> 15:01.428
after the action of May 2nd. And I didn't know. I 
didn't have any knowledge of it. I was wounded. I

15:10.336 --> 15:12.297
came through hospitals. I came through two 
hospitals in Vietnam and Japan and the United

15:12.317 --> 15:19.924
States. I received a nation's second highest 
award. It was an interim award, but no one knew

15:26.688 --> 15:32.734
about it.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.998
My commander didn't even know that I was alive. 
What is the second highest honor? The nation's

15:39.341 --> 15:43.345
second highest award is Distinguished Service 
Prize. And I wore that for seven years, for five

15:43.365 --> 15:50.953
years.

15:50.973 --> 15:55.378
And other people, other servicemen that remember 
me, that served in Vietnam and that served with

15:56.337 --> 16:04.827
special forces, they questioned me about the 
Medal of Honor. I had no knowledge of it. And my

16:07.249 --> 16:21.466
commander, who didn't think that I was still 
alive, had recommended me for the Medal of Honor,

16:07.249 --> 16:21.466
but had given me an interim award of the 
Distinguished Service Corps.

16:21.906 --> 16:25.230
He had made a recommendation for the Medal of 
Honor. which I have documentation.

16:29.790 --> 16:32.654
And that went on until 1973, 74. And then I found out 
the full extent of the opera, of the

16:32.674 --> 16:41.849
recommendation, everything. And I... It still 
took how many years before you got it? Thirteen.

16:46.757 --> 16:47.538
Thirteen years. That's a long time. It is. It was. 
And there was a lot of frustration. But, you know,

16:56.962 --> 17:03.850
in the military, the military is one big family. 
And thank God you have so many people that help you,

17:03.870 --> 17:12.139
you know, that take so much interest in you. I have 
some of the greatest friends that I have met. My

17:18.086 --> 17:20.749
wife and I and the kids.

17:22.518 --> 17:30.848
that these people would have never rested until 
they saw that justice was done. Would you have to

17:32.330 --> 17:39.760
say that that's one of the proudest days of your 
life, when the president gave you that medal?

17:40.020 --> 17:44.746
Well, yes, because the president recognized me. 
Or because the president, what he says in that tape

17:44.766 --> 17:50.533
about the Vietnam veterans. Because that was 
really the first praise that the Vietnam veterans

17:51.408 --> 17:55.792
had ever gotten, really? I think, yes. From the 
government or the public or anybody? But still, we

17:59.877 --> 18:09.686
have to think that we have the POW and MIA and the 
Agent Andre. I have spoken with the president

18:09.706 --> 18:16.093
after he gave me the award and later. There's one of 
the highlights of mine. career or the lifetime in

18:22.694 --> 18:31.045
my

18:22.694 --> 18:31.045
career. But I keep thinking my buddies, they're 
still behind the bamboo curtain. And their

18:37.834 --> 18:42.180
children, which I have letters, I receive letters 
from. You work a lot with the MIA and POW cause? I do,

18:46.065 --> 18:46.786
I do. I'm very deeply involved with it. I'm 
religiously involved with it. and any of the

18:52.934 --> 19:01.447
veterans that are wounded, I try to help as much as I 
can. In fact, sometimes I even ask my wife if she

19:01.467 --> 19:09.860
thinks that she's neglected by the children 
because of my travel. What about the Agent Orange

19:11.343 --> 19:14.167
controversy? Do you have any feelings about that? 
Well, yes, I think I'm going to make them obey Agent

19:17.953 --> 19:21.338
Orange. I flew a lot with those range hands, with 
the foliation planes.

19:33.751 --> 19:45.486
It was made, the veterans, the victims of the Asian 
War were given an option of accepting 180 million

19:33.751 --> 19:45.486
dollars. And to me, this was an insult. In fact, I 
went to Houston to testify before the federal

19:52.216 --> 20:04.707
judge because we took an oath to defend this 
country, and this country didn't set a price tag.

20:06.529 --> 20:11.773
Yet, they're setting a price tag for us after we 
defend this country. They're saying, hey, look,

20:11.794 --> 20:20.181
we're giving you 180 million bucks because we 
think that, or you think that you was injured

20:20.600 --> 20:23.964
Because there's defoliation.

20:24.405 --> 20:28.290
These lawyers that have these people that are 
injured in car accidents get millions of dollars.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.131
That's right. Well, that goes back to what I said 
earlier. Way back in the day. These people have too

20:35.580 --> 20:40.246
much education to have enough common sense. I 
mean, they are the ones that are enjoying freedom

20:40.266 --> 20:47.355
at the expense of our body's life. So... By taking 
our soldiers and defending these other

20:49.658 --> 21:00.572
countries, it's keeping them from having the 
people invade our country where we don't have to

20:49.658 --> 21:00.572
see the war sites. We will never have this country, 
ma'am. We will never have this country invaded.

21:05.337 --> 21:05.878
You know why? No. Because this country has got too 
much pride. This country has got too much

21:12.747 --> 21:16.812
self-respect. Yet, these people... that are 
upholding us to keep the self-respect in this

21:19.392 --> 21:27.661
prime, they're lowering this country. And 
they're the ones that are getting these other

21:27.701 --> 21:33.908
people to fight against them. Those are the ones 
that are doing it. The monetarys are strong.

21:41.456 --> 21:48.083
You'd be surprised how many people, once they know 
that you're an American, they would love to talk to

21:41.456 --> 21:48.083
you, to touch you. Because you come from a free 
world. This country is the freest of all. Yet those

21:55.729 --> 22:05.080
people in the Pentagon, in those high-level 
offices, they're the ones that are destroying us,

21:55.729 --> 22:05.080
not us.

22:08.284 --> 22:12.810
And that's why I have been to Congress. And I have 
asked them to leave that jungle of

22:12.830 --> 22:18.357
air-conditioned offices to come down here. and 
see us they don't know how we live they make the

22:18.556 --> 22:47.449
rules and regulations up there they don't know 
what it is you know to go across the mud they don't

22:18.556 --> 22:47.449
they have forgotten

22:18.556 --> 22:47.449
but then who's going to suffer our children the 
future leaders of this country and who's going to

22:18.556 --> 22:47.449
make them suffer Our own leader.
