00:02.647 --> 00:07.033
Bill Tift at the University of California, 
University of Arizona. Well, he's from the

00:07.474 --> 00:14.263
University of Arizona, but we're currently at the 
Student Union of the University of California.

00:14.283 --> 00:19.650
Okay, so let's get started at the beginning, and 
Bill, for the record, give your full name. William

00:20.391 --> 00:21.533
Grant Tift. And where and when were you born? April 
5th, 1932 in Derby, Connecticut. How did you first

00:29.043 --> 00:31.506
get interested in astronomy? This has to do with 
the history of planetary astronomy. I never

00:37.261 --> 00:38.643
wanted to be anything else. I became interested in 
science or knew I was going to be a scientist about

00:40.245 --> 00:49.517
fourth grade in school in astronomy by the time I 
was in eighth grade. And through a local amateur

00:49.537 --> 01:02.995
astronomer, elderly lady in my hometown, I met 
Dirk Brouwer at Yale.

01:03.852 --> 01:11.382
for the next major step, well, in various amateur 
activities, AAVSO, things like that,

01:03.852 --> 01:11.382
Westinghouse Science Talent Search. I was one of 
the trip winners in 1950 to Washington and got to

01:11.443 --> 01:16.089
know Harlow Shapley. Harvard was the obvious 
place to go to get undergraduate training, and so I

01:17.451 --> 01:24.000
went to Harvard as an undergraduate. And you were 
an astronomy major. I was an astronomy major.

01:26.463 --> 01:27.204
Which is kind of rare. Well, there were a number of 
us. Several other names that are Well, one in

01:33.687 --> 01:42.498
planetary astronomy is one of my roommates was 
Fred Franklin at CFA. He's, I believe, in

01:43.759 --> 01:46.202
planetary astronomy. Yes, and I interviewed him 
in England. We were roommates at Harvard. And Dick

01:53.151 --> 01:58.518
Sears, who's known in astronomy, was one of the... 
So we had astronomy majors in those days. When did

02:00.881 --> 02:02.783
you get your bachelor's degree? 1954. Okay, and 
then where'd you go to grad school? Caltech. Why

02:07.409 --> 02:08.410
did you pick Caltech? Because astronomy was 
disintegrating at Harvard. That was when Bach

02:11.855 --> 02:22.209
left Harvard and it switched from an 
observational institution in the Shapley

02:11.855 --> 02:22.209
Revolution. When Shapley resigned and the 
Southern Hemisphere Observatory was

02:22.229 --> 02:32.803
potentially being closed and things like that, it 
was not a time to go on in observational astronomy

02:22.229 --> 02:32.803
and Caltech was the obvious place where 
first-rate observational astronomy was being

02:33.340 --> 02:39.828
done. So I went to Caltech. And

02:43.392 --> 02:49.860
what was your thesis and who was your thesis 
advisor for your PhD? OK. My thesis was on the

02:50.481 --> 03:02.115
photometry of the nuclei, nuclear regions of 
galaxies, well, photometry of galaxies on an

02:50.481 --> 03:02.115
eight-color system. My advisor was Art Code. But 
he was at Wisconsin, wasn't he? He was at Caltech at

03:08.013 --> 03:19.390
that time, and then

03:08.013 --> 03:19.390
later left Caltech. I guess he went back to 
Wisconsin as director at that time. Bill Baum was

03:24.357 --> 03:28.643
my other sort of advisor. I say sort of advisor 
because I actually saw art code only twice during

03:29.146 --> 03:35.813
my thesis, the beginning and at one intermediate 
point. I had one discussion with Bill Baum.

03:38.796 --> 03:40.478
Otherwise, I pretty much did it myself. When did 
you get your PhD? 1958. Okay, and what did you do

03:45.403 --> 03:47.826
then? I went as a postdoc to Australia to work on 
Magellanic Cloud problems. With Bach? Well, Bach

03:55.741 --> 04:00.225
was director then, and it was through Bach that I 
made the arrangements. But again, it was a program

04:00.726 --> 04:03.509
I designed myself. I wasn't working specifically 
with anyone. Okay, now, so when did you leave

04:06.732 --> 04:09.254
Australia? Okay, Australia, I was a two-year 
National Science Foundation postdoc. I left

04:17.302 --> 04:25.410
there in 1959

04:17.302 --> 04:25.410
and finished the last few months of the postdoc 
at... Caltech, and then I had arranged a job in

04:25.778 --> 04:45.557
Nashville with Carl Seifert at the University of, 
well, at Vanderbilt University, Dyer

04:25.778 --> 04:45.557
Observatory. Unfortunately, Carl Seifert had 
been killed in an automobile accident. As a matter

04:52.103 --> 04:53.524
of fact, it was It happened an hour before I arrived 
in Nashville for my first visit. I was met by a

04:59.778 --> 05:09.952
graduate student, in fact, Charles Tolbert, 
well-known in astronomy, who told me that Carol

04:59.778 --> 05:09.952
had just been killed in an automobile accident. I 
went to Seaford's funeral.

05:15.339 --> 05:21.047
But that changed what was to be a three-year 
appointment working in high-latitude blue stars

05:21.955 --> 05:35.717
to a one-year appointment immediately looking 
for a job, which is when, well, I had previously met

05:21.955 --> 05:35.717
John Hall and was interested in possibilities at 
Lowell. And so I immediately picked up that

05:35.817 --> 05:38.080
thread. And since Harold Johnson had just left 
Lowell and they had just acquired the Ohio State

05:39.623 --> 05:49.178
69-inch telescope, And I had the kind of 
credentials both in photometry and experience

05:49.597 --> 05:56.027
with large telescopes. So basically I was offered 
Errol Johnson's job at Lowell. So I was actually at

06:01.516 --> 06:03.880
Vanderbilt then only for one year. Okay, when you 
got to Lowell, what was the place like?

06:12.648 --> 06:25.504
Well, it's a beautiful place to live and a 
beautiful place to enjoy yourself in perhaps one

06:12.648 --> 06:25.504
of the most wonderful settings and pleasant 
places to live. But I think the one thing which is

06:26.405 --> 06:36.117
most obvious about Lowell was obvious then was the 
extremely tight budget under which they

06:26.405 --> 06:36.117
operated. The question of the controls of the 
lowell estate and a fairly small section portion

06:41.015 --> 07:05.284
of which was devoted to maintaining the 
observatory and although i don't know many of the

06:41.015 --> 07:05.284
details i know there was a lot of concern about 
whether the any of the additional estate money

06:41.015 --> 07:05.284
would would become available to astronomy the

06:41.015 --> 07:05.284
uh I never really went into any discussions on 
this, but there was a lot of concern as to how

07:07.643 --> 07:21.186
you could operate an effective modern 
observatory on the extremely small amounts of

07:07.643 --> 07:21.186
money which were available. You mentioned 
yesterday that early on in the space program, it

07:23.430 --> 07:30.462
was about time, you were getting old. the powers 
that be or whoever decided that they really didn't

07:30.661 --> 07:42.157
want to get involved with the space program 
because it didn't have the base on which to do it,

07:30.661 --> 07:42.157
which is kind of surprising in that later that they 
did get the Planetary Data Center and everything.

07:42.177 --> 07:43.379
Could you say that for the record? Right, that's 
correct. Well, for various reasons, part of them

07:46.744 --> 07:58.360
personal in my own life, I was going through 
approaching divorce and so on, there was a certain

07:46.744 --> 07:58.360
feeling on my part that I needed some change. The 
space program was developing. And I wrote a letter

08:00.732 --> 08:25.545
at one point to the Institute of Astrophysics or 
whatever it is, the NASA Institute in New York

08:00.732 --> 08:25.545
City, I believe, and expressing interest in space 
astronomy and was referred to Jocelyn Gill and I

08:00.732 --> 08:25.545
forget his first name, Foster's division in NASA 
on manned space astronomy. And They invited me

08:29.740 --> 08:31.943
back to Washington for a while. I went back as a 
consultant for a couple of months. What year was

08:34.365 --> 08:36.167
this, roughly? It would have been around 19... 
Well, I went to Lowell in 61. Probably the original

08:39.792 --> 08:45.298
correspondence here was in 62, possibly as late as 
63. When I came back from Washington, I was quite

08:46.479 --> 08:55.230
interested in the space program and potentially 
interested in applying to the astronaut program.

08:55.250 --> 08:58.093
In fact, I did apply later in 1965. But I remember 
having discussions with John Hall and expressing

08:59.069 --> 09:20.971
my interest in the space program and getting this 
feedback or concern that, well, this really was

08:59.069 --> 09:20.971
not the kind of direction that they felt that they 
could support the program. But if I was interested

09:21.011 --> 09:27.557
in going into this, that perhaps this wasn't the 
proper base to operate from. And, of course, they

09:28.043 --> 09:44.567
had hired me in a completely different context, 
basically, to use, I mean, to do photometry with

09:28.043 --> 09:44.567
some of the large, their newer large telescope, 
well, the 6090s. Not that it was that great a

09:44.928 --> 09:51.958
telescope, because it wasn't at that time until 
they redid it a few years later. and made it into a

09:52.073 --> 09:55.817
72-inch with a quality mirror. I spent a lot of 
time... Well, there were two problems. One, the

09:59.260 --> 10:01.743
69-inch was not a high-quality telescope. You 
couldn't do imagery with it. The images tended to

10:07.949 --> 10:12.514
distort rapidly as a function of temperature 
changes. I remember doing a lot of installation

10:13.415 --> 10:18.300
work on the telescope, trying to control the 
figure on the mirror. And also, because of the very

10:18.938 --> 10:24.946
low budgets at Lowell, they had very little 
instrumentation. There was no equipment,

10:24.966 --> 10:27.069
really, to go with it. One reason they had hired me 
was I did have my own part of my own photometer.

10:33.137 --> 10:37.403
Harold Johnson had taken all the equipment with 
him when he left. And there really was no working

10:37.423 --> 10:42.470
equipment. I got a small ONR grant with which I 
built up a working photometer and did use the

10:47.913 --> 10:55.521
69-inch to extend the work that I had done as my 
dissertation. That was my main new scientific

10:55.561 --> 11:00.326
research that I did at Lowell. But in parallel, I 
was developing this interest in the space

11:01.607 --> 11:05.631
program. And it was that aspect that,

11:05.651 --> 11:16.502
well, John Wall specifically was a little 
apprehensive about whether this was an

11:16.938 --> 11:23.447
appropriate type of development that Lowell 
wanted to support. Let me just get something in for

11:24.188 --> 11:25.851
the record. When did you leave Lowell? 1964, 
essentially. Initially, it was half time, I

11:31.919 --> 11:37.608
think, from July to October of 64. I was half time at 
Lowell and half time at Arizona. And then in

11:41.727 --> 11:45.493
October of 64, I was full-time at Arizona. Where 
you have been since then. Where I've been there

11:47.135 --> 11:48.758
since then, that's correct. I went there as 
associate professor and was promoted to full

11:48.798 --> 11:54.146
professor in 1973. When you were at Lowell,

11:56.750 --> 12:05.563
Lowell is, of course, famous to the public for its 
planetary and particularly Mars studies. But, of

12:05.623 --> 12:10.030
course, they always did, right from the very 
beginning, a lot of stellar and galactic work. for

12:10.718 --> 12:15.444
which, of course, they didn't get the credit that 
they deserved. But when you were there, what was

12:15.664 --> 12:24.556
the attitude towards planetary versus stellar 
and galactic and extragalactic work? I mean, you

12:24.576 --> 12:27.760
were there for this life. Well, there was a strong 
support, I think, or a feeling that the work that

12:27.780 --> 12:36.051
Harold had done and the study of star clusters, 
There wasn't much experience there in galaxies,

12:37.128 --> 12:44.177
although I remember having discussions with some 
of the U.S. Naval Observatory people. There had

12:45.539 --> 13:00.958
been some interesting work that had been done by,

12:45.539 --> 13:00.958
what was his name, some multicolor photography or 
multicolor imagery that had been done on galaxies

12:45.539 --> 13:00.958
at Naval Observatory. I think they were quite 
enthusiastic, actually, about the work that I was

13:01.715 --> 13:07.783
doing on galaxy photometry. It fit rather nicely 
into the kind of things that Harold had been

13:07.843 --> 13:14.813
initially exploring. I'd also done work in star 
clusters and things, so I had a lot in common in

13:15.313 --> 13:25.928
principle with the kinds of things that Harold 
Johnson had been doing, and I think they were very

13:15.313 --> 13:25.928
enthusiastic about that kind of work. I was 
never... I encountered very little feeling that

13:29.508 --> 13:44.456
Lowell had a planetary orientation or there 
certainly was no pressure in any sense to be doing

13:29.508 --> 13:44.456
anything that was connected with planetary work. 
I think they considered their work potentially

13:44.476 --> 13:53.372
quite broad-based.

13:54.517 --> 14:13.086
One of the very visible programs there was Henry 
Giklis' work on proper motions of red faint stars,

13:54.517 --> 14:13.086
and I actually was considering some observations 
of some of the proper motion stars. I'd say it was a

14:13.747 --> 14:17.132
fairly broad-based program, stellar, 
extra-galactic, Obviously planetary, but that

14:17.298 --> 14:20.702
wasn't an aspect that I had much connection to. Did 
you ever feel that you were considered by real

14:20.722 --> 14:27.950
astronomers to be second rate because you were at 
Lowell instead of, say, Mount Wilson? No, I didn't

14:28.411 --> 14:30.033
have that feeling at all. I thought Lowell was a 
highly respected observatory. It was recognized

14:33.597 --> 14:37.381
that they had budgetary or monetary problems.

14:39.884 --> 14:46.512
But, for example, my request for an ONR grant was 
very well received. And Lowell, I think, was a very

14:47.200 --> 14:50.443
respected observatory. And the people that were 
there, not that there weren't very many of us, but

14:50.463 --> 14:56.029
Bill Sinton was well known. And of course, Harold 
Johnson had been extremely well known. It was a

15:02.516 --> 15:09.063
small group, but I think my general impression was 
highly regarded. You overlapped with some of the

15:10.745 --> 15:13.968
real old timers there. And that's what I want to hit 
you for. OK.

15:20.900 --> 15:32.374
I saw,

15:20.900 --> 15:32.374
well, of the Slipher brothers, I knew EC 
moderately. That is, I met him a couple of times,

15:32.454 --> 15:35.818
had a few discussions with him. Vesto, I saw a few 
times. He was not around the observatory very

15:42.726 --> 15:45.169
much. And that was really before I got into my 
modern work in galaxies. In a way, I wish I'd had a

15:50.737 --> 15:57.868
chance to have actually talked to some of them 
about some of the early redshift work that they

15:50.737 --> 15:57.868
did. I never actually had any direct contact with 
them on that. For the record, of the two brothers,

16:00.792 --> 16:05.359
EC was the one who did what? The two Slipher 
brothers. Bestow, Melman, and EC. Yeah, you

16:10.687 --> 16:11.828
probably know. I mean, I don't know the history 
quite as well. Which one was the Mars guy? Well, I

16:15.592 --> 16:22.566
assume EC was more of the planetary oriented, and 
Vesto a little more. Well, I know Vesto, I believe,

16:23.427 --> 16:31.423
was the one who did the actual

16:23.427 --> 16:31.423
rich of observations. interesting in that if you 
go back into elementary textbooks of 10 or 20 years

16:31.758 --> 16:42.693
ago, it's always Hubble, Hubble, Hubble, and now 
people have been getting their act together, and

16:31.758 --> 16:42.693
they note that it was really Slipher that did it. 
Slipher did the actual first observations.

16:44.756 --> 16:45.397
That's correct. Slipher was the one who made the 
observations, though I believe it's fair to say it

16:45.697 --> 16:56.432
was Hubble that recognized the significance, and 
I don't really know what the communication chains

16:45.697 --> 16:56.432
were. I mean, they obviously knew each other, 
and... I think any material or information that

17:00.648 --> 17:12.124
was collected by Slipher became known and was 
used, at least as a starting point, for Hubble.

17:12.185 --> 17:16.230
What exactly how it influenced Hubble's 
beginning, I have really no idea. But it puzzles me

17:17.372 --> 17:28.528
in a way, and that's why I wish I had known at the time 
what I was going to be doing later, because it would

17:17.372 --> 17:28.528
have been very interesting to talk to the Slipher 
brothers about What were their original

17:28.728 --> 17:31.111
motivations for doing this? And what were their 
impressions? Unfortunately, I have no idea. They

17:37.339 --> 17:42.927
obviously didn't pursue it or follow it up the way 
Hubble did. So whether they considered it just a

17:43.668 --> 17:51.278
curiosity or whether they really thought deeply 
about what this might mean, I don't know. But they

17:51.558 --> 17:56.625
preceded the knowledge of what they were looking 
at. And I believe part of the original motivation

17:57.095 --> 18:04.043
for their observations were undoubtedly the idea 
that perhaps galaxies were... I mean, we've seen

18:04.063 --> 18:16.097
this in the literature, but again, I don't have it 
as a direct statement for mislifers that galaxies

18:04.063 --> 18:16.097
were considered as possible solar systems in 
formation. That was one of the old concepts. Did

18:19.001 --> 18:20.362
you ever meet Lamplin? No. No. Because there was a 
lot of... radiometry that went on in the 20s and 30s

18:24.753 --> 18:44.331
I knew Edison Pettit but that was back through in 
fact Edison Pettit was the man who built the

18:24.753 --> 18:44.331
photometer that I took to Australia or built the 
Kolbach to my specifications but he was the only

18:24.753 --> 18:44.331
really old uh uh I guess he was retired from Mount 
Wilson, but he was still running his machine shop

18:44.800 --> 18:55.092
in Pasadena, and I was referred to him and made 
arrangements for him to build my photometer. But

18:55.512 --> 18:59.717
again, I never had any in-depth conversations 
with these people. I've heard various stories

19:00.698 --> 19:05.643
about how the old work was done, but... Well, let's 
hear an old story. Well, like the first

19:06.484 --> 19:14.233
observations of photometry on the 100-inch 
telescope when... They used a ballistic

19:14.753 --> 19:35.115
galvanometer operating

19:14.753 --> 19:35.115
across the 10-foot width of the Newtonian 
platform on the 100-inch telescope to get the

19:14.753 --> 19:35.115
first photometric deflections that were used in 
some of the early galaxy photometry that people

19:14.753 --> 19:35.115
like Pettit and Stevens and Whitford and so on were 
doing. At Lowell, when you were there, what did the

19:36.236 --> 19:41.402
people on the staff think of Percival Lowell?

19:44.774 --> 19:54.909
Well, I had the impression that he was a very highly 
respected founder of the observatory. I never

19:54.929 --> 19:56.271
heard anything negative. And the old library 
there, the tours that they held, his founding of

19:57.673 --> 20:09.870
the observatory, his original connection with 
Mars and so on was always very highly regarded, as

20:10.964 --> 20:13.027
far as I could tell. I was never directly, I say, 
involved in any of this. I never remember any

20:17.553 --> 20:22.340
conversations relating to Lowell. I had a number 
of conversations with the

20:22.380 --> 20:34.356
man who administered the estate. executor, not 
executor, but sole trustee or something, wasn't

20:34.910 --> 20:39.878
it? Sole trustee, yes. Was his nephew or something 
like that? Yes, his nephew, Roger Lowell Putnam

20:42.262 --> 20:56.765
was the trustee, and I remember going for a hike up 
Mount Humphreys. We didn't get to the top, but I

20:56.785 --> 21:01.032
remember I went on a hike with him. I said, Again, 
the main theme that came through was lack of money.

21:07.046 --> 21:17.563
I never detected anything but enthusiasm for 
doing the best astronomy we can at this

21:07.046 --> 21:17.563
institution, but we don't have much money. How did 
the townsfolk treat the observatory and the

21:18.945 --> 21:22.931
astronomers there? My impression, again, was 
that this was a highly respected institution.

21:31.660 --> 21:41.753
Again, I never detected any animosity or any 
feeling that this

21:31.660 --> 21:41.753
was anything but a real nice thing to have in town. 
And it was a standard viewing place. People would

21:44.617 --> 21:52.267
drive up the drive, and it was always considered 
one of the best places to look over the surrounding

21:44.617 --> 21:52.267
area. I just flew over it Saturday, and there was a 
hole in the clouds. The only one between... I think

21:59.318 --> 22:06.147
San Antonio and San Francisco, and there was 
Flagstaff, and there was Mars Hill with the little

21:59.318 --> 22:06.147
white domes on top. Of course, Anderson Mesa 
development had just started, and there were a

22:06.187 --> 22:27.756
couple of, well, there was, I guess, there was a 
telescope down there, and I can't remember the

22:06.187 --> 22:27.756
exact sequence in which these were moved or built, 
which was the one connected with the lunar mapping

22:06.187 --> 22:27.756
program. which was going on there. And that was 
being done by, what, the Air Force or NASA? That was

22:33.562 --> 22:34.603
the Air Force. It was an Air Force program, and it 
was specifically oriented towards

22:34.623 --> 22:51.198
preparing best maps of the moon for the moon 
landings, future moon landings. The USGS, I guess

22:51.218 --> 22:56.983
it was, and Gene Shoemaker's program, They were in 
Flagstaff around that time. They were located on

23:01.418 --> 23:04.582
the north side of town, a different location. 
Yeah, I knew Gene Shoemaker, or got to know him

23:05.303 --> 23:12.613
later, because we were both astronaut candidates 
in 1965. But again, I had no direct connection,

23:12.733 --> 23:18.621
just these were interesting programs which were 
going on in the area. There was interest in

23:19.061 --> 23:23.447
specifically the preparation for the moon 
landing. I didn't associate... Any of this work

23:25.313 --> 23:33.266
with any of the other aspects or any other parts of 
the solar system was all very much moon-oriented.

23:33.286 --> 23:49.633
Now, I want to take you to Arizona and then your 
involvement with NASA because the title of this

23:33.286 --> 23:49.633
book, God Willing the Creek Don't Rise, it gets 
printed, is Phoenix, NASA and the Rebirth of

23:33.286 --> 23:49.633
Planetary Astronomy. And you did have a strong 
connection with NASA, which is how I first got to

23:49.900 --> 23:55.668
meet you. When did this start? Well, I'd say it 
started with this letter to NASA Space Science

23:58.732 --> 24:17.899
Institute in New York City and then was referred to 
Jocelyn Gill, OSS, that branch of OSSA,

24:18.689 --> 24:25.476
Because I was interested in the space program, and 
I wanted to find out, well, was there any way of

24:18.689 --> 24:25.476
getting more closely involved in it? That's why 
Jocelyn Gill then invited me to come to

24:25.676 --> 24:42.333
Washington, be a consultant in her office, 
specifically preparing some training manuals or

24:25.676 --> 24:42.333
answering questions for the astronauts. I 
remember writing a little paper for Jocelyn on...

24:46.820 --> 25:01.497
meteors as a little information paper to go to the 
then Mercury and I guess by then Gemini

24:46.820 --> 25:01.497
astronauts.

25:01.757 --> 25:14.312
Out of this meeting with our original contacts 
with Jocelyn, and I don't remember the details,

25:01.757 --> 25:14.312
and I'd always kind of expressed interest in the 
lunar program, I was referred to a

25:14.798 --> 25:23.352
conference that was being held in Chicago. At 
O'Hare Airport. At O'Hare Airport. And I was the

25:25.235 --> 25:27.418
guy that arranged it and chaired it. Right. It was 
on the military orbiting laboratory. And at this

25:30.583 --> 25:42.342
time, there were discussions about merging the 
Air Force orbiting laboratory program and NASA's

25:30.583 --> 25:42.342
plans for orbiting laboratories. And this was 
called the MOL Conference or something. And I

25:47.013 --> 25:53.559
don't remember exactly how I got invited to it, but 
I'm sure it was in one way connected with out of

25:47.013 --> 25:53.559
Jocelyn Gill's office. That's where the size of 
the original space telescope, which is now called

25:53.659 --> 26:03.128
Light Space Telescope, got to be 120 inches 
because Aidan Meinel was there. And I asked him,

26:03.168 --> 26:06.691
what's the biggest diffraction thing we could 
have in 10 years? And he said 120 inches. It was at

26:08.052 --> 26:13.197
that meeting that I came in knowing very little 
about what was going on. I, of course, had heard of

26:13.337 --> 26:16.260
the Air Force program and I knew there were general 
long-range plans on the part of NASA, and it

26:17.000 --> 26:39.642
was at that meeting that basically I met Aiden 
Meinel, who recognized my interest, and it was

26:17.000 --> 26:39.642
then, and I believe, was Harlan Smith at that 
meeting? Yes. Both Harlan Smith and Aiden Meinel

26:40.723 --> 26:45.167
were at that meeting, recognized this as a 
potential field of development, apparently

26:45.468 --> 26:53.598
recognized me as somebody who was interested in 
working in it. And I got job offers very shortly

26:54.079 --> 27:01.648
from both Aden to come to Arizona and from Harlan to 
come to Texas. And

27:03.030 --> 27:11.020
went to basically begin developing manned space 
science programs to help them in developing that

27:11.523 --> 27:18.333
kind of program. And I like the atmosphere at 
Arizona, particularly when I visited one right

27:19.254 --> 27:30.690
after the other and accepted Aidan's offer to, 
again, I hated to leave Lowell. It was a beautiful

27:30.710 --> 27:38.981
place, and I was doing good work in galaxy 
photometry, but I say I needed a change for several

27:30.710 --> 27:38.981
reasons. One was personal with my I was coming 
divorced, I was divorced in 1964, with custody of

27:41.105 --> 27:50.701
two children, and then aged two and a half and three 
and a half. I needed a change, and I was very

27:51.201 --> 27:58.393
interested in the space program, and I said, well, 
this is a good time to go do something else. Hayden

27:58.874 --> 28:04.543
offered an atmosphere, and he's a remarkable 
person. Well, so, of course, was Harlan. I learned

28:08.982 --> 28:15.269
photometry from Harlan at Harvard, which was 
where I learned how to do photoelectric

28:08.982 --> 28:15.269
photometry. But Arizona offered the 
opportunity. The new space sciences building had

28:18.953 --> 28:21.576
just been completed. The section was dedicated to 
space astronomy that I helped to lay out and built

28:21.656 --> 28:29.465
up. Well, we obtained a NASA grant, initial grant, 
I guess, I'm not sure whether I'd have to go back and

28:38.260 --> 28:46.269
look at the papers, exactly how my name and Aiden 
Meinl's name were combined. His philosophy was he

28:46.689 --> 28:56.601
would run the classified military side of things, 
and I would handle the NASA civilian side. What was

28:56.621 --> 28:58.783
NASA giving you the money to do? Initially, it was 
experiment or possible design. I think our

29:05.711 --> 29:07.693
original proposal was a telescope that would 
float beside Gemini or be carried on Gemini

29:08.112 --> 29:19.246
spacecraft and be operated possibly remotely, 
maybe connected to it. We wanted to investigate

29:19.326 --> 29:28.758
the possibility of carrying a small telescope 
attached or slightly detached from Gemini and

29:19.326 --> 29:28.758
operated in real time. This then later led to the 
development of, well, I had two fundamental

29:29.298 --> 29:36.988
programs that I worked on. three, actually, that 
were funded, some out of NASA headquarters and

29:38.234 --> 29:46.383
some later out of Marshall Space Flight Center. 
One was to develop a ultraviolet camera that would

29:47.364 --> 29:59.177
operate on a stable platform, stabilized 
platform, for ultraviolet photography with film

29:47.364 --> 29:59.177
recovery. The idea was to bring back a as complete a 
survey of the sky in the UV as possible. We were

30:10.899 --> 30:26.553
developing reflecting filter, interference 
filter type coatings and design of a very compact

30:10.899 --> 30:26.553
aspheric system for wide field imaging. And the 
idea was to do a sky survey, photographic and bring

30:26.573 --> 30:31.858
back the film. That was one of our key programs. 
Here's one thing I've got written down, and I want

30:34.293 --> 30:37.578
to ask you before I forget it. In your opinion, 
what's NASA like today compared to what it was in

30:38.279 --> 30:45.010
the early 60s? Well, if it was like it was in the 
early 60s, I would probably still be in it. What's

30:50.258 --> 30:50.859
changed?

30:53.543 --> 31:02.477
Well, as our programs developed, as we got further 
into experiment development and possibilities,

31:02.828 --> 31:14.486
It became clear that there was, and you'll find 
this in my discussion with Joe Terowitz, that

31:02.828 --> 31:14.486
there was an intense conflict between the manned 
and the unmanned side of NASA. And I was interested

31:15.909 --> 31:20.175
in the manned side. I felt that man had a role in 
space. I was also strongly oriented toward the

31:22.519 --> 31:25.123
lunar program. and felt that we should get a base on 
the moon as soon as possible and begin to develop

31:26.217 --> 31:33.505
some self-sufficient. I thought the long range in 
astronomy really should be founded on the moon.

31:39.672 --> 31:54.148
But

31:39.672 --> 31:54.148
what I saw progressively happening was a lot of, 
well, I was being lost in this battle between

31:39.672 --> 31:54.148
manned and unmanned astronomy.

31:55.597 --> 32:03.869
Ultimately, when the things like the Vietnam War 
developed and so on, everything seemed to be

31:55.597 --> 32:03.869
turning downhill. I didn't see... We didn't get 
our mission, for example. We would have flown on

32:07.354 --> 32:10.238
Skylab 2. There had been a Skylab 2, but it was cut 
off. We saw the follow-on OIO programs being cut

32:12.802 --> 32:17.368
back. And it looked like, well, yes, one could hang 
on in the field, but The future really didn't look

32:24.554 --> 32:29.041
very bright, and especially didn't look very 
bright for manned astronomy. So I basically,

32:29.722 --> 32:41.439
after spending quite a bit of NASA money, simply 
decided that wasn't a profitable field to work in.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.944
I was on the original planning group for the Large 
Space Telescope. I was a member of the Woods Hole

32:45.044 --> 32:53.076
study group that led to the

32:53.242 --> 32:57.586
planning for HST, but it was a long way downstream. 
And I didn't see much opportunity in the interim

32:57.606 --> 33:00.048
period. When you were getting NASA money, how did 
headquarters handle you? Did they micromanage?

33:06.954 --> 33:09.076
Do you think they knew what you were doing? Well, 
they knew what I was doing, but I was supported for

33:09.336 --> 33:13.099
funny reasons. I was in the manned space program, 
and I had very strong connections with

33:13.880 --> 33:22.928
particularly people at Marshall Space Flight 
Center. They were interested in developing

33:23.397 --> 33:31.990
basically packages for some of their large 
rockets. They were interested in basically the

33:32.110 --> 33:38.420
origin of the Skylab program, and they wanted 
packages to put on them. They weren't getting

33:38.761 --> 33:42.566
cooperation from NASA headquarters.

33:45.170 --> 33:50.198
But I was well enough supported that there was a 
feeling at headquarters that, They had better

33:51.713 --> 33:56.681
support me, better fund me, so that they would have 
some control over what was going on. I received

33:57.282 --> 34:07.117
money from Nancy Roman's office, not because my 
programs were especially favored by them, but so

33:57.282 --> 34:07.117
that they could retain some control of what I was 
doing. And instead of being funded entirely out of

34:07.818 --> 34:18.615
Marshall Space Flight Center, which is where 
about half of my money came from, there was a lot

34:07.818 --> 34:18.615
of... That's what I mean by this conflict 
between... the headquarters and the stations,

34:19.203 --> 34:27.015
this was very apparent in the work that I was doing. 
It did play a role in the way I was funded.

34:37.572 --> 34:43.742
Do you think that astronomers in general do a good 
job of selling themselves to the public?

34:46.490 --> 34:50.895
And this includes planetary astronomy, because I 
assume that that's part of astronomy. Well, I

34:51.576 --> 34:55.961
think people have become much more aware of this 
now than they were in the past. I think in the past,

34:56.021 --> 35:07.434
astronomy has really been pretty naive in 
assuming that just the fact that it's good

34:56.021 --> 35:07.434
academic science should be sufficient. So 
basically, I know. I don't think astronomers have

35:09.176 --> 35:14.742
done a very good job of selling themselves to the 
public. And it takes a lot of time to do it. And the

35:17.000 --> 35:23.510
problem is, we'll say, the kind of work that I do.

35:26.695 --> 35:38.353
When you work as an individual scientist, you 
don't have a lot of support, particularly if you do

35:26.695 --> 35:38.353
controversial science like I do with no support, 
or practically no support. You don't have time. to

35:41.806 --> 35:44.269
spend a lot of time doing the popularizing. What 
you need is a large enough base and the kind of

35:44.329 --> 35:52.138
support that you can have a public relations 
person.

35:52.879 --> 35:57.905
You need the kind of people around you who can 
provide the interface. And that's an area we have

35:57.925 --> 36:01.950
not seen, I don't think, well enough supported. 
Scientists have got to be given enough support

36:02.671 --> 36:10.260
that they can have some PR people who know how to 
construct this interface. Because most of us

36:10.645 --> 36:17.617
don't have the time to do it ourselves, nor the 
knowledge to do it ourselves, to do the proper kind

36:10.645 --> 36:17.617
of interface. And so I think there's been a lot of 
very naive scientists who think that all they've

36:18.077 --> 36:26.191
got to say is, well, I mean, everybody knows good 
science should be done. That should be

36:26.231 --> 36:27.132
sufficient. It isn't sufficient. You've got to 
popularize it. You've got to present it in a way

36:30.498 --> 36:36.568
that you'll be... the public would be more 
enthusiastic about. Very few scientists know how

36:39.499 --> 36:42.102
to do that. Of course, if you go way back, you know, 
to the turn of the century, there were some really

36:42.122 --> 36:48.989
great promoters around in astronomy, George 
Orwell. Now, that all seemed to die, and what I

36:49.049 --> 36:55.676
always call the Mount Wilson, the public be damned 
attitude took over. Yes, I would agree very much

36:56.096 --> 36:58.519
with that. And we have seen the basic, well, it's 
often called the Mount Wilson or Caltech,

37:05.877 --> 37:10.321
Princeton Access

37:05.877 --> 37:10.321
developed. And one had a feeling that, well, if 
they thought something should be done, that

37:10.501 --> 37:20.851
supposedly was all that was necessary. And there

37:20.911 --> 37:26.857
were plenty of us out there who didn't agree with 
that philosophy. I mean, Aidan Meinl and I were a

37:26.877 --> 37:34.804
good example of who felt that we could have done a 
lot more science in the man space program. than, in

37:35.611 --> 37:44.659
fact, we ever got a chance to do because

37:35.611 --> 37:44.659
the decisions had been made that it was to be done 
one particular way. And the man space program,

37:44.919 --> 37:49.423
well, give us your money. We don't really care 
about this program. Just give us the money and

37:51.925 --> 37:54.047
we'll go ahead and do the astronomy. Do you think 
that attitude is changing now?

38:01.494 --> 38:02.334
Not entirely. I mean, we still see the same... 
fundamental disagreement that astronomy

38:05.885 --> 38:21.421
divides into, or science divides into, those who 
are willing to work with the manned program and

38:05.885 --> 38:21.421
those who just want unmanned spacecraft. And 
there's a role for both. I've always felt, and I

38:23.863 --> 38:35.875
think that the public, in many respects, is more 
enthusiastic, or there's a lot of enthusiasm

38:23.863 --> 38:35.875
still for manned space-type activity. and I don't 
think that resource was ever properly supported

38:36.665 --> 38:44.096
by science, that approach. I can't interview any 
of the participants in this, so I'm asking

38:45.538 --> 38:50.906
everybody that might have an opinion. What do you 
think killed planetary astronomy in the early

38:50.946 --> 38:54.812
part of this century?

38:57.856 --> 38:58.277
Killed it? I don't think it was ever killed. Sure, 
there was some stuff being done in the 20s and 30s,

39:01.602 --> 39:04.326
but But planetary astronomy was a big part of 
astronomy at the turn of the century. And then by

39:07.538 --> 39:10.601
the time you get to 1920s, it's not. Oh. Well, OK. I 
mean, there was a big shift in interest because the

39:12.362 --> 39:22.992
capabilities came along and the knowledge came 
along to explore stellar astronomy and then extra

39:12.362 --> 39:22.992
galactic astronomy. I mean, there's always a 
tendency to move, certainly, or I feel, to move

39:23.012 --> 39:28.357
where the frontier is. And the frontier is usually 
near the limits of detection. And when the planets

39:34.917 --> 39:41.607
are bright and easy to look at. And I think a lot of 
the reason that people turned back to planetary

39:42.328 --> 40:02.157
astronomy, though, was when the close planetary 
flybys started coming along and people suddenly

39:42.328 --> 40:02.157
realized how much more detail and interest or 
interesting subjects there were that that It is

40:02.542 --> 40:11.451
the space program itself that swung the interest 
back in the direction of planetary astronomy,

40:02.542 --> 40:11.451
because it became clear that so much more could in 
fact be done. And then we had the new generations of

40:11.511 --> 40:13.713
detectors. And it's kind of interesting. I think 
you see these new techniques being focused on very

40:16.216 --> 40:23.663
nearby things, like the solar system, and very 
distant things. And there's a gap now. The gap is

40:25.465 --> 40:29.089
now in between, where For example, we're looking 
at very distant galaxies and ignoring the nearby

40:29.525 --> 40:36.716
ones, except for distance scale calibration and 
so on. We're making the assumption, again, that we

40:36.756 --> 40:41.283
understand the nearby thing. And I disagree very 
strongly on that. The nearby galaxies, I think,

40:43.165 --> 40:55.684
harbor some very interesting,

40:43.165 --> 40:55.684
well, my own work on the question, of course, is 
directly relevant there. you see this

40:56.373 --> 40:58.935
leapfrogging technique. Z equals zero to Z equals 
five. We focus your attention on the nearby

41:01.058 --> 41:03.600
things. I think the space program did that. The 
primitive early investigations, beginning as

41:05.182 --> 41:17.514
early as, say, the Ranger spacecraft, which 
focused attention again on the detailed surface

41:05.182 --> 41:17.514
of the moon or the properties of the surface of the 
moon. You see that once a spacecraft had studied

41:18.154 --> 41:24.220
the Jupiter system and Now a lot of interest in 
ground-based observations of the satellites, of

41:24.942 --> 41:36.779
the studies of EO and so on was refocused by the 
space program. I don't think the astronomers

41:37.820 --> 41:49.937
themselves would have ever, by themselves, would 
have ever gotten as enthusiastic about the solar

41:37.820 --> 41:49.937
system if it hadn't been for the space program. 
Recently, so you think that NASA money, really,

41:51.031 --> 41:59.620
for probes and supporting ground-based 
astronomy really brought back monetary

41:51.031 --> 41:59.620
strongman? Yes, I think I feel that very strongly. 
I don't think it was the astronomers themselves,

42:01.462 --> 42:07.388
even given the detectors. Well, some, I'm sure, 
would have looked at the planets, but it was the

42:07.708 --> 42:19.300
excitement generated by the space program that 
brought, well, probably a lot of people had been

42:07.708 --> 42:19.300
trained or Their job opportunities were 
conditional upon the availability of space

42:19.769 --> 42:25.416
money. The number of astronomers trained was 
increased considerably because of the space

42:25.476 --> 42:33.927
program. Recently, a lot of people have been 
getting a lot of publicity and evidently money.

42:41.808 --> 43:00.101
By working on topics such as search for 
extraterrestrial intelligence, search for

42:41.808 --> 43:00.101
other solar systems, the ozone hole in the Earth's 
atmosphere, and killer comets and asteroids, you

42:41.808 --> 43:00.101
think they're overdoing it? Well, I think these 
are all valid fields of investigation. The reason

43:06.310 --> 43:14.677
why some of these are emphasized or why the focus is 
there is because they are programs which you can

43:06.310 --> 43:14.677
popularize. Now, I don't think that should be the 
judge of how you support science. And in a sense,

43:20.442 --> 43:23.465
yeah, I think I would agree with you. I think some of 
these are overemphasized in the sense of, well,

43:23.505 --> 43:36.216
the public will support this, or we can put it in 
such a way that the public will recognize its,

43:23.505 --> 43:36.216
quote, importance. So OK, that's a good way to go. I 
think part of this work is motivated by we need

43:41.940 --> 43:49.532
money, and this is a way to get money. And not 
necessarily because it's necessarily the best

43:50.534 --> 43:53.058
science. I'm sure that if you ask a general 
cross-section of scientists what are the best

43:53.118 --> 44:01.191
problems to concentrate on, that these would be 
mentioned, but they certainly wouldn't be the

44:02.268 --> 44:08.114
unique ones. And I think things like the SETI 
program,

44:08.134 --> 44:21.348
there's a lot of interest in this, and it is 
scientifically important.

44:21.368 --> 44:24.632
On the other hand, it's a little bit like the search 
for missing mass. You can put an awful lot of effort

44:26.214 --> 44:29.457
into it for very little return. And there's some 
balance point in terms of what is the reasonable

44:30.635 --> 44:44.392
amount of resource and effort to put into this 
until you get some indication that there's

44:30.635 --> 44:44.392
something that really needs to be followed up. The 
program should not become ends in themselves.

44:49.178 --> 44:56.848
There's a little bit of a tendency, or more than a 
little bit of a tendency, for them to become simply

44:49.178 --> 44:56.848
a means of continuing support. And it's Without 
the proper checks and balances, are we getting

44:59.795 --> 45:05.941
something back, or are we really making progress? 
What do you think the state of astronomy is now? And

45:07.782 --> 45:11.345
this includes planetary astronomy, because we 
all sink or swim in the same ocean.

45:15.449 --> 45:16.330
Are we sinking? I think astronomy needs a...

45:17.111 --> 45:26.879
Well, I think it has stagnated a little bit. We see 
too much...

45:33.460 --> 45:35.142
Well, I think there's a little bit of fear out 
there. Nobody really knows how we're going to

45:35.162 --> 45:40.348
continue to support this institution.

45:45.975 --> 45:55.026
I think there's a feeling that we're going to see a 
retraction, and everybody is kind of scrabbling

45:45.975 --> 45:55.026
to make sure that they're not the parts that are 
cut. And in facing this retraction of support, uh i

46:02.418 --> 46:29.792
think people are not looking objectively at the 
science anymore but they're saying well what can i

46:02.418 --> 46:29.792
get money for there's too much focus on what can i 
get money for and too little on regardless of the

46:02.418 --> 46:29.792
money what science should we what are the what are 
the things that we must preserve in terms of

46:02.418 --> 46:29.792
science there are a few odd people like myself who 
would i will pursue what i think should be done in

46:30.262 --> 46:33.045
science, I don't have outside support. So I can 
speak a little bit objectively. I don't worry

46:34.647 --> 46:40.314
about protecting my resources because my 
resources are my own salary. And I mean, I came to

46:40.334 --> 46:44.159
this meeting, I paid my own way. And I go observing 
at National Radio Observatory, I pay my own way. I

46:49.185 --> 46:52.268
don't have support even from my own institution. 
Well, the institution doesn't have the money to

46:53.049 --> 46:54.872
give me. Everything comes from these outside 
grants. And when you do controversial work, it's

46:59.641 --> 47:01.744
very difficult to get these outside grants. I 
think that's wrong. And in that sense, I say our

47:03.987 --> 47:18.146
science is being driven by

47:03.987 --> 47:18.146
large money programs rather than supporting 
scientific ideas. Now, of course, you were at

47:19.228 --> 47:26.998
Lowell when it was still in the bailing wire and 
sealing wax era.
