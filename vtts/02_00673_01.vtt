00:01.533 --> 00:13.508
It's November the 13th, Friday, and I am visiting 
with Dr. Jack Campbell, who has been in the

00:01.533 --> 00:13.508
Department of Curriculum and Instruction since 
1970. And Dr. Campbell is going to share a few of his

00:13.528 --> 00:30.308
thoughts and perceptions about the changes that 
have occurred at Texas A&M since he arrived,

00:13.528 --> 00:30.308
perhaps something about what might have caused 
some of these great changes and how it has affected

00:30.777 --> 00:32.461
the growth of the college. And do you have a 
particular change or a series of changes that have

00:33.262 --> 00:41.640
occurred that stand out as the most important?

00:45.529 --> 00:47.132
I think if I could just point out some of the things 
as I've gone back over my notes that maybe some of

00:48.226 --> 01:00.283
which you can use later on. The most important 
changes I may not be in a position to know, but I've

01:01.484 --> 01:15.904
learned about Texas A&M and the need for a 
professor of foundations at the Annual meeting in

01:16.677 --> 01:22.603
Chicago, 1970, February 28th and 29th. I was 
attending the History of Education Society, John

01:24.825 --> 01:34.555
Dewey Society, and saw the flyer, which I believe I 
have given you. And I was surprised. Excuse me. At

01:38.959 --> 01:40.160
the convention in February. I believe I have given 
you a copy of it. I have a copy, yes.

01:48.723 --> 01:54.069
Earl Jones was associate to

01:48.723 --> 01:54.069
Dean Hill. Glenn Johnson was the chairman of the 
PDCI. Paul Hensarling was with the Ed Ed

01:57.933 --> 02:13.971
department and I think had, at one time, been a 
candidate

01:57.933 --> 02:13.971
for dean. Let's see, as I moved into the 
university, the first one, the first big

02:16.027 --> 02:38.357
committees I was on was the Rutter Lecture 
Committee, which was a series of lectures to honor

02:16.027 --> 02:38.357
the president who died shortly before I arrived at 
Texas A&M. He was in the hospital. I had some notes,

02:39.398 --> 02:44.245
but by the time I arrived for the August beginning 
of the 1970s session. On this committee, there

02:50.986 --> 02:53.530
were a number of people. I remember Professor 
Chalk, especially, with economics. And I can go

02:59.979 --> 03:09.753
back and find that material if you are interested 
in the first lecture. I'm interested in

03:09.833 --> 03:14.299
everything right now, Dr. Campbell, because 
everything has so many tie-ins to a lot of the other

03:14.583 --> 03:17.407
things that I'm hearing. And then again, 
everybody saw everything from different

03:17.467 --> 03:22.353
viewpoints. And of course, it illustrates the 
interaction with other parts of the committee.

03:26.499 --> 03:35.250
Our first speaker was Jacques Barzun, the former 
president of Columbia. Did you say these lectures

03:35.431 --> 03:40.217
were in honor of the president's brother? Yes. We 
only had two of them, and then it just died out. But

03:46.349 --> 03:59.040
Bar-Zoon, if we were going to pay, I think we were 
going to pay them something like $10,000 for a

03:46.349 --> 03:59.040
series of lectures, and then we would publish 
them. The Bar-Zoon, Jacques Bar-Zoon, he has

03:59.060 --> 04:12.012
noticed he's called the Cultural History of 
Columbia Observation Saturday on the third final

03:59.060 --> 04:12.012
session of the lecture. Are these to talk about 
Rutter himself? No, nothing to do with Rutter. His

04:18.730 --> 04:22.476
lecture was on manners, on the history of manners. 
However, he never sent us the manuscript. It's

04:26.201 --> 04:40.083
also an interesting anecdote-wise that

04:26.201 --> 04:40.083
our president at this time was our new president,

04:26.201 --> 04:40.083
Williams. And Barzun never flew. So he was coming 
by train, and we were all in the auditorium waiting

04:44.493 --> 04:55.940
for his lecture, and he hadn't arrived yet. His 
train was stuck somewhere in Waco. And I was

04:58.837 --> 05:06.906
sitting with President Williams, and Mr. Eskel 
Monroe got in his car and had driven me to Waco. We

05:06.926 --> 05:10.530
had Barzun somewhere between here and there. 
Well, Williams was regaling the audience. But

05:13.913 --> 05:15.094
Barzun finally came. That was his first of three 
lectures. The series was on manners.

05:22.342 --> 05:23.123
The committee. came through with a second letter 
lecture the following year. Of course, now this is

05:28.592 --> 05:35.381
April of

05:28.592 --> 05:35.381
1972. In 1972, it was also important because we 
established the chapter of Kappa Delta Pi, which

05:35.401 --> 05:53.025
was the honorary society in education that 
included women. Kappa Delta Pi. Kappa Delta Pi.

05:56.939 --> 06:01.324
I'll make a copy of this, which gives you the names 
of the first people. I had long been a member of that

06:01.664 --> 06:10.233
society and was one of the installing officers for 
the initiation team. At that time, Frank Huber was

06:10.253 --> 06:17.781
also initiated into Kappa Delta Pi first.

06:19.752 --> 06:21.013
Is that still in? Is that an active chapter? Yes, 
that is still active. It's more or less serving our

06:23.696 --> 06:31.063
undergraduates now because Phi Delta Kappa has 
now admitted women. But in 1972, it did not. And as a

06:34.226 --> 06:40.432
new college of education, we had mostly women. A 
little anecdote wise, I asked one of the corps

06:40.592 --> 06:49.320
members one time, how many corps members were in my 
education classes? And they said they wanted to

06:50.077 --> 06:53.582
see what girls looked like. Anyway, we had the 
monopoly on girls. Oh, that's cute. So we

06:59.430 --> 07:01.774
established Kappa Delta Phi. We also had a 
civilian student council at that time, which was .

07:12.469 --> 07:19.459
I was also appointed in 1972 by President William 
A. Centineo committee, and a little bit later for

07:20.468 --> 07:29.579
the centennial committee for the diversity. What 
were the duties in that committee? Well, in the

07:33.063 --> 07:41.332
bicentennial committee, we never really did a 
lot. But with the centennial committee, we made

07:41.493 --> 07:46.999
arrangements to develop that film. that certain 
spirit or whatever, I forgot what it was. We also

07:53.008 --> 07:59.735
got Hill to do the carvings. That was

07:59.796 --> 08:05.201
one of the things our committee did. And we 
arranged for countless lectures. The 1976

08:07.544 --> 08:16.513
lecture that I was mainly responsible for was when 
R. Freeman Butts, who was a leader in the history of

08:07.544 --> 08:16.513
education and was the co-chairman of my 
doctorate, I came here from Columbia to speak.

08:23.901 --> 08:33.292
I had to check on this, but I was active in the Texas 
Association of College Teachers since coming

08:23.901 --> 08:33.292
here. I was twice president.

08:38.258 --> 08:41.181
I was president at the centennial. I think I was 
president again when the Senate was developed.

08:46.531 --> 09:00.354
Texas Association of College Teachers spoke for 
officers and administrators in Austin.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.536
President Miller was inaugurated. I was a host of 
that. I can't remember. I

09:07.422 --> 09:12.351
remember that. I was here for that one. I do 
remember. Miller's? There was one. That escapes

09:16.618 --> 09:19.163
me. And Miller was also the only person, to my 
knowledge, who joined TACT.

09:27.807 --> 09:38.668
Mr. Campbell, when were the women admitted to Phi 
Delta Kappa, and was that a local decision, or was

09:27.807 --> 09:38.668
it the national association?

09:38.688 --> 09:46.943
It was a national, and it came as a result of court 
cases. I think you can confirm that. And Mark, in

09:47.565 --> 09:48.887
our department, is the president this year. I was 
just initiated into it last Monday night. Oh,

09:53.714 --> 10:07.049
well, I just don't have time because I have three 
night classes, and by Thursday I'm so tired I can

09:53.714 --> 10:07.049
hardly think of going up.

10:07.069 --> 10:11.854
But back in the early 70s, you see, the women had 
that. Don't wait. I really think Kappa Delta Pi,

10:12.175 --> 10:19.583
it's just as old as Phi Delta Kappa, and in my way of 
thinking, it was a greater... organization that

10:20.103 --> 10:35.091
had admitted

10:20.103 --> 10:35.091
first honor societies to blacks and women, and 
that was an honorary member. When we look at all of

10:35.543 --> 10:52.843
these things that were happening back when you 
just first got here in the 70s, and you were

10:35.543 --> 10:52.843
instrumental in working very actively in a lot of 
committees, the mission of the college was still

10:35.543 --> 10:52.843
the same as it is now, or as it was for any land grant 
university, not just the College of Education.

10:52.923 --> 10:56.828
But teaching, research, and service have been the 
focal point. Has that changed, or has the emphasis

10:56.848 --> 11:03.576
changed on those, in your perception, within this 
college? like more pressure or more emphasis on

11:03.910 --> 11:09.597
research versus teaching or survey. No different 
departments concentrate more on one. I think that

11:15.785 --> 11:28.602
under Dean Buber, that as far as tenure and 
promotion is concerned, the stress was on

11:15.785 --> 11:28.602
publication, which It's easy to measure,

11:29.442 --> 11:50.427
and of course it gives national knowledge, and 
that was important, because teachers came here,

11:29.442 --> 11:50.427
even in Texas, nobody knew that they were going to 
be taught with a parent-teacher. That was

11:50.447 --> 11:52.189
probably the biggest supplier and most respected 
supplier of teachers. So we had to get visibility.

11:53.692 --> 11:58.811
How can I document that about it being the most 
respected supplier of teachers? I know I've heard

11:58.892 --> 12:00.658
it a couple of times. Well, I think you can. the best 
place to find out first how many you're producing.

12:08.276 --> 12:16.906
And it's possible that TEA would be the best source 
there for how many we're producing. I think you're

12:16.926 --> 12:21.050
also maybe even leading the nation in math and 
science. That's what I heard. But this is just

12:22.672 --> 12:26.837
hearsay, of course. I'm more conscious of the now, 
you know, since visiting with you, about

12:27.172 --> 12:36.284
verifying, you know, historically some of these 
things, and that's the thing that I'm not sure. Of

12:36.304 --> 12:42.852
course, I don't see this as much historical as an 
oral history. It is. So when somebody else can use

12:44.774 --> 12:49.040
this data for what it might be worth in terms of... 
So it's not absolutely essential that I have, if I

12:49.060 --> 12:54.006
say something like what you just said, I don't have 
to, you know, come back and triangulate in such a

12:54.458 --> 13:04.093
way that it's verified right here that we do 
produce the most or that... Well, you can say that I

12:54.458 --> 13:04.093
said that. Now, I may be wrong. Well, whoever, 
several other people have said it, and I've seen

13:04.734 --> 13:09.402
it, and I've heard the dean say it at meetings. Our 
memories are tricky. You're not... Oh, sure. And

13:12.066 --> 13:16.833
that's why we need to, just like in our income tax, 
we have to keep records. And, but... I would say

13:20.986 --> 13:46.523
that Dean Corrigan's style is

13:20.986 --> 13:46.523
quite different

13:20.986 --> 13:46.523
and feels that the worth of a person should

13:20.986 --> 13:46.523
be considered, not just publication, so that we 
could put someone forward for them as a

13:20.986 --> 13:46.523
distinguished publication list as we used to. 
What is this person's contributions and get along

13:48.644 --> 13:52.650
without this person, and that's sort of the 
criteria. There still is a penalty, so to speak,

13:52.670 --> 13:56.196
for not publishing. I know I had at least one person 
say that they have paid the price by not getting a

13:56.296 --> 14:05.391
full professorship because they have not 
published, even though they've been here for 30

13:56.296 --> 14:05.391
years. Yes, you see, the publication record is the 
easiest thing to measure, and it's the one thing

14:05.531 --> 14:12.542
that Well, what about

14:13.602 --> 14:20.676
service, though? I'm seeing a lot of visibility on 
the people that are out there working with, you

14:21.357 --> 14:29.232
know, things like the principal center, all those 
different conferences. I'm happy because that's

14:32.735 --> 14:35.720
where I've been. But doesn't that also provide a 
lot of visibility for the college? What kind of

14:39.367 --> 14:41.310
service do you mean? Well, like going out into the 
educational field and doing some collaborative.

14:46.019 --> 14:50.687
I guess maybe that's part of, is it part of service 
or part of teaching? Yes, yes it is. And I think,

14:52.150 --> 14:56.096
here for instance, I have a few things in the 
folder. I used to, when I, this is 1973, have

14:56.116 --> 15:02.948
students go out to the the girls club, the boys 
club, child development centers, and contribute

15:03.670 --> 15:10.820
their time. This was before we had a lot of field 
services. Now, of course, this is done to a greater

15:14.685 --> 15:18.010
extent. How did that change? It helped the 
community. Sure. It really got the community

15:19.993 --> 15:21.575
involved. The field service activities, and I 
know they have changed, but when did they start

15:21.675 --> 15:26.201
changing? Because I know teachers would never 
even get in the classroom. We didn't until it was

15:29.877 --> 15:34.722
time for student teaching after we'd already been 
three or four years in school. That's why I taught

15:35.042 --> 15:37.465
the foundation courses. I'd get them at the 
beginning and I would make arrangements. I

15:40.728 --> 15:43.991
couldn't get them into public schools very 
easily. It was very complicated to get them into

15:44.011 --> 15:48.676
observe. And so I got them into the girls club, the 
boys club, all the various church education. Is it

15:54.953 --> 15:59.160
easier now to get into the public schools? Oh, yes. 
We have someone who's in charge of that. But they

16:02.365 --> 16:06.111
didn't have that when I started here in the early 
70s. And in order to get them into the school, I

16:06.311 --> 16:16.067
would have to make rather detailed arrangements 
and then sometimes relationships. Who's in

16:16.840 --> 16:18.922
charge of that kind of activity? Tim Blair. He's 
student teacher. Yeah, that's the field

16:22.585 --> 16:24.487
experience. Oh, I see. We get people out earlier 
now. But it was a big administrative position. And

16:31.294 --> 16:34.657
while I was teaching classes, I couldn't do that so 
well. And it was not good to give weeks in advance.

16:41.283 --> 16:44.586
But if they were contributing to the girls club, 
the boys club, some of these time going on a regular

16:44.971 --> 16:49.876
basis. It wasn't as bad if they didn't show up 
sometime. In this work that you did, like these

16:55.561 --> 17:10.876
things with students, Dr. Campbell, what about 
because of the growth of the college, has that

16:55.561 --> 17:10.876
affected your ability to, not your ability, but 
how you're able to work and interact with students

16:55.561 --> 17:10.876
just because of the sheer numbers? Oh, I don't 
really feel that way at all. A&M has been

17:12.598 --> 17:14.860
remarkable. I've never been anywhere that, 
especially with students, from my own doctoral

17:15.312 --> 17:26.284
experience, very self-determining. One of the 
things that Dean Hubert had, which still I bet was

17:26.404 --> 17:39.818
this, you had to be here after you were here, 
whereas I taught at Brooklyn very often, faculty

17:40.118 --> 17:45.483
came in for their classes and maybe one or two hours 
of office. Is that a policy of the college, or does

17:45.543 --> 17:48.045
it go by department? Or is it an understood thing? 
It's not just... Well, I think it came with the

17:50.047 --> 17:55.312
Corps and with the military. I mean, even now, when 
you say that the faculty are expected to be, are

17:55.332 --> 18:02.319
normally here, is it, are you told by the 
department? No, no, no. It's just sort of a habit. I

18:06.523 --> 18:09.906
even feel a little bit guilty if I go to the dentist. 
Because you're used to being there. So we do have a

18:15.240 --> 18:17.242
lot of time. As always, though, students very 
often hesitate to come in. We have this mentor

18:23.629 --> 18:25.632
service. It's voluntary, is it not? It's 
voluntary. Are you one of the mentors? Yes, but I

18:30.998 --> 18:35.683
just started this year, and I haven't had a single 
mentoree. OK, but that's interesting. How many

18:39.738 --> 18:43.402
graduate students committees do you serve on 
average? I would say 50. And I think I'm just well

18:46.224 --> 18:51.910
over-subscribed. And the last couple of years, 
I've been trying to cut back, because I do not share

18:52.090 --> 19:06.825
very many, because people do not do historical 
dissertations. But since I teach the

19:07.970 --> 19:15.480
foundations,

19:07.970 --> 19:15.480
I get them early. I don't want to do historical 
visitations. They're hard. They're very

19:22.128 --> 19:22.809
time-consuming. Now, we've talked about the 
different things that have affected the

19:22.929 --> 19:29.598
different changes and so forth. How do you see the 
college now versus at the beginning? as it is

19:34.548 --> 19:38.337
viewed by others or by outsiders. I've had some 
strong comments about, you know, not a put down

19:38.357 --> 19:47.359
necessarily, but that the College of Education 
was I don't know what you mean. Oh, I see what you

19:49.825 --> 19:50.666
mean. How do people view the college, and how has 
that changed? When I first came here, I was quite

19:54.671 --> 20:02.021
delighted, because it seemed that education was 
respected. Of course, that's very unusual. You

20:05.205 --> 20:10.513
had the respect of all of the colleges. And I think 
that Corrigan has the respect of everyone who

20:10.533 --> 20:14.578
knows him. I think the problem with education

20:15.487 --> 20:27.160
and its respect is that, historically, there's 
been a profession for slaves. The politicians

20:27.180 --> 20:32.767
themselves have not been happy about it. It took a 
long time for them to accept the lawyers as

20:32.787 --> 20:37.512
optional workers for expanding the mind and so on. 
but

20:38.116 --> 21:04.275
education

20:38.116 --> 21:04.275
is probably the most complex, and we don't have the 
hope, and I think we do make claims that we're a

20:38.116 --> 21:04.275
science, but my feeling is essentially we're 
doing the best we can, and I think there's been a lot

20:38.116 --> 21:04.275
of progress in expanding several phases since

21:05.723 --> 21:16.596
I've

21:05.723 --> 21:16.596
been here. When I came back to develop 
competency-based programs, that was the main

21:16.616 --> 21:29.110
point that we put everything to spell out the 
terminal behaviors, present a number of

21:16.616 --> 21:29.110
competencies. Is that not the case now? But we've 
been developing all of our courses on that. And I

21:35.947 --> 21:54.293
can't remember the year, but it started to affect 
other parts of the university, where if we were

21:35.947 --> 21:54.293
going to produce history, we would also have to 
develop courses around competencies that was in

21:35.947 --> 21:54.293
education that you can't hit the other 
departments. When you say you can't hit, who was

21:54.914 --> 21:58.943
doing the hitting? Well, that was the state. Oh, 
okay. The state was, all of our programs had to be

22:01.989 --> 22:06.699
competency-based. Now, the Attorney General, 
and this is a date you have to verify if you're

22:07.902 --> 22:14.416
interested. Thank you. I had a

22:17.054 --> 22:24.929
great deal to do with this, how to teach, 
professions, how to teach. And after that settled

22:24.949 --> 22:35.991
down, and

22:24.949 --> 22:35.991
right now, of course, we're involved in 
completely dismantling. the climate or the, you

22:36.865 --> 22:44.196
know, within this department, because this is the 
department that will be the hardest hit, I'm

22:36.865 --> 22:44.196
assuming. Yes, we are working on what might be 
superior programs if we can develop a five-year

22:44.216 --> 22:57.036
certification program. Are you involved in this 
process? No, I am not involved. I'm on one service.

23:03.545 --> 23:11.658
slightly active in one community, which is 
developing. If we could get

23:11.678 --> 23:22.595
interdisciplinary majors to truly liberal arts, 
I think this would... But we're working on a

23:22.615 --> 23:26.441
five-year plan, which the state may not approve 
of. Oh, that'd be decided. We have... To get this

23:28.874 --> 23:51.056
new program online

23:28.874 --> 23:51.056
by January, the

23:28.874 --> 23:51.056
sheets are

23:28.874 --> 23:51.056
quite unreasonable as to say to dismantle and 
restructure a program that allows no more than 18

23:28.874 --> 23:51.056
hours. I think this will not include reading 
courses. But that you would major in another

23:53.438 --> 23:56.181
field, it has put a great deal of pressure on us. 
We've gone through before. And survived. And

24:00.968 --> 24:04.011
survived. I think people are thinking very well of 
teachers, although I don't have undergraduate

24:04.031 --> 24:10.358
seminar. Oh, okay. I do not teach students. I just 
period people off. And these will not really

24:12.040 --> 24:16.084
affect any of the graduate programs? Not unless 
they abolish the major in education at all. There

24:20.169 --> 24:23.232
is the possibility, you see, that... It would be 
abolished

24:23.853 --> 24:31.626
completely. I did some research on the history of, 
more or less chronicled the attitude of teachers

24:32.107 --> 24:41.742
in the ancient world. And when you see they were, 
they isolated teachers. They said, okay, when we

24:45.108 --> 24:48.173
start meeting teachers in public schools, we'll 
put them in normal It's voice activated. I guess

24:49.991 --> 24:51.053
I've been taking too much of your time. No, it's 
voice activated. No, that's fine. No, we're doing

24:52.875 --> 24:55.899
great. Anyway, we're in another phase here where I 
think that... A lot of changes, again, that we're

24:56.640 --> 25:08.937
looking at that are going to carry us perhaps, 
well, for sure, into the 20th or 21st century with

24:56.640 --> 25:08.937
possibly a whole new model. It could be that we'll 
have a terrible teacher shortage. I'm hearing

25:11.821 --> 25:13.603
that a lot. And we already have one on the way, you 
know. And also teacher retention, which is

25:18.730 --> 25:32.623
something that bothers me a lot, because maybe 
we're putting out all these teachers, but are they

25:18.730 --> 25:32.623
staying out there? Well, I think the best ones 
aren't. And the problem is, you're a

25:34.085 --> 25:39.410
conscientious person doing teacher education, 
but we're not reforming the schools. I think it's

25:39.430 --> 25:43.373
immoral to take that kind of training. And the 
people that will stay are the ones that are going to

25:43.393 --> 25:47.157
find the easiest way in class, so they don't have to 
talk to them. Burnout. I mean, of course, I'm not in

25:48.093 --> 25:53.179
the field, but you can't both be on that. I think 
that if you're going to perform teacher

25:53.199 --> 26:01.949
education, you just can't perform teacher 
training. I feel we can change the whole system.

26:03.511 --> 26:04.332
But they have tried to reduce class size. Yes. Dr. 
Campbell, since you arrived at Texas A&M, because

26:04.512 --> 26:15.585
you've worked under two administrations, plus 
the interim in between, what are some of the

26:04.512 --> 26:15.585
highlights, maybe a highlight of each? of each 
era. I'm calling it an era because it was very

26:17.386 --> 26:20.149
distinct. You know, half has been Dean Hubert 
within the life of the College of Education. Now,

26:25.375 --> 26:33.383
this second half, which will be hitting 20 years 
pretty soon, is, you know, just a little bit about,

26:25.375 --> 26:33.383
you know, the highlights. I also am going to ask you 
about, you know, your own contribution and what

26:33.403 --> 26:38.469
you feel the best about. But you have a lot of 
insights and with your historical background,

26:39.270 --> 26:45.336
you know, your anecdotes are priceless. But is 
there something that stands out? Well, we've been

26:50.742 --> 26:56.673
on 12-month appointments from the beginning.

26:59.438 --> 27:07.594
And we don't have the summer or semester, once in a 
while, talk of things. Did you have sabbatical

27:07.962 --> 27:10.005
leave any time? No, no. No, I took the spring of 86 
off without pay. I was just worn out. My brother

27:18.138 --> 27:20.522
died, and my mother needed a little bit of 
attention. And I was just worn out. It was probably

27:23.246 --> 27:30.077
kind of burnout, so I arranged to take the spring

27:23.246 --> 27:30.077
off. So I, you know, it seems as though I've been 
involved semester after semester, pretty much

27:35.789 --> 27:39.034
the same thing. I always do my teaching 
differently. I'm continuing revising what I'm

27:42.639 --> 27:55.218
doing, but I think I'm more like an enlisted man 
peeking over the top of the trench, and I don't see

27:42.639 --> 27:55.218
the whole picture. So the administrators would be 
better to see the campaign.

28:03.329 --> 28:18.024
I'm

28:03.329 --> 28:18.024
meeting the class

28:03.329 --> 28:18.024
that's going to do it. We're all leaders to our 
campus. It's a very exciting time. I know you might

28:22.148 --> 28:24.611
say that we haven't trained. I think that's the 
year I got to be a professor, too. That would have

28:25.712 --> 28:29.055
been about six years after you arrived, right? 
Yes. Is that the average for our tenure? I got

28:32.118 --> 28:39.269
tenured earlier, but I didn't get promoted at that 
time. Now we usually have tenure and promotion at

28:39.289 --> 28:42.514
the same time. The guy was tenured a few years 
earlier. That's another thing that I was going to

28:44.156 --> 28:46.800
ask you about. Interacting and collaborating 
with your colleagues or within departments or

28:46.820 --> 28:56.655
even outside of this department. Do you have an 
opportunity to do very much of that? Quite a bit. I

28:59.558 --> 29:03.863
don't think there's as much as there used to be. 
There's not as much there anymore because we're

29:03.883 --> 29:12.914
getting so big. But our department is such a hard 
working department. Glenn Johnson, his health

29:19.282 --> 29:21.725
broke down under the strain. He had a heart attack 
under the strain. this department do to people? We

29:26.903 --> 29:27.584
knocked them off. I think they worked very hard.

29:40.620 --> 29:49.491
But there's so many certification programs,

29:40.620 --> 29:49.491
so much work to do. We had David David temporarily. 
He's been in our department ever since. I think he

29:50.953 --> 29:51.754
came in 1980. A typical choice. Well, I was on one of 
the breakfast luncheons with Corbin. I was trying

29:53.436 --> 29:54.518
to remember some of the other candidates. One of 
them I think I had known him because he was from

29:56.273 --> 30:05.567
Kentucky, and I knew him because he'd gotten the 
other two candidates we brought before him. And I

30:05.667 --> 30:08.392
understand they were all pretty... All very good. 
I can remember as a little anecdote why someone

30:08.412 --> 30:17.245
said, well, why don't we go

30:08.412 --> 30:17.245
to Maryland? Well, that's not the same. Oh, that's 
great. Oh, another thing that might be of interest

30:19.709 --> 30:22.213
is that... In 1982, I had proposed that we just have 
study abroad. Donna Norton and I developed

30:30.244 --> 30:35.911
courses.

30:37.112 --> 30:47.945
And Donna Norton got a grant from

30:37.112 --> 30:47.945
Conoco,

30:37.112 --> 30:47.945
which was lost. And we had to get to the 
coordination board. And believe it or not, there

30:49.948 --> 30:51.930
was the feeling What can anybody learn? The 
students were taken from here to go study there?

30:58.162 --> 31:04.349
Yes, and we took 30 students in 1982 from the 
National Affairs. It's changed so many times. But

31:06.631 --> 31:14.079
they found this college very reasonable, and they 
had contacts. So we got the foreign development

31:14.179 --> 31:16.682
here. The study abroad. and I think comparative 
education. Was this the first department to

31:19.740 --> 31:22.124
initiate that? Well, it's the first in education, 
as far as I know, and less agriculture. The Ag Ed, of

31:32.017 --> 31:34.480
course, had extension programs. There's been a 
lot of international work with other parts of

31:34.500 --> 31:38.826
college, but I know we have more courses in the 
summer. I don't know if I asked you this earlier.

31:40.888 --> 31:42.150
I'm in another conversation. about how you felt 
that the college was achieving its mission on the

31:42.417 --> 31:50.419
teaching and research.
