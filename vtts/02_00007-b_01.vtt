00:02.579 --> 00:13.839
Well, during Religious Emphasis Week, a speaker or speakers, ministers, were brought to the campus.

00:14.059 --> 00:17.806
Ordinarily there was one minister and a different one each year.

00:19.008 --> 00:25.279
And he would give a certain number of lectures or talks.

00:25.259 --> 00:31.485
during the week, as I recall, every day, you know, two or three hours.

00:32.747 --> 00:51.165
And I recall one very vividly because mother and dad both came up to me, and I was sitting, and handed me a letter, and it was my acceptance for Baylor Medical School.

00:51.145 --> 00:56.252
which was a very spiritual event.

00:57.874 --> 00:59.556
Reckon the Lord was at work that day.

00:59.876 --> 01:03.621
That's right.

01:03.681 --> 01:19.482
Was there ever any... The talks were excellent, and they were such that it would appeal to a broad spectrum of Christians, and not just for one segment or something else.

01:19.462 --> 01:25.030
Do you remember ever anyone objecting to religious emphasis week at a public university?

01:25.111 --> 01:32.341
No, I don't recall any individual or group complaint.

01:34.825 --> 01:36.548
And it was held in Guyon Hall?

01:36.568 --> 01:38.130
Guyon Hall.

01:38.290 --> 01:41.816
Let's see, movies, other lectures.

01:42.777 --> 01:43.699
Graduations.

01:44.179 --> 01:45.942
Graduations.

01:47.812 --> 01:53.884
Let's see, and the basketball arena then was DeWare.

01:55.307 --> 01:55.868
Yes.

01:55.888 --> 01:57.050
Gee, Riley wasn't better.

01:57.070 --> 01:57.371
That's correct.

01:58.012 --> 02:03.002
And did you students go to just about every basketball game and football game?

02:04.889 --> 02:08.313
Many students did.

02:08.474 --> 02:12.419
I went to most of the football games.

02:17.325 --> 02:27.758
Bill Eccles and I sat with the Corps the first game as freshmen, and fortunately Hank Fullberg's younger brother, Hank Fullberg was later football coach,

02:27.738 --> 02:31.262
His younger brother was a sophomore in death battery.

02:31.342 --> 02:34.766
We sat with our unit.

02:35.046 --> 02:46.218
And usually the freshmen had the sophomores behind them, which meant that they were constantly encouraged or more than constantly encouraged to make a yell.

02:47.139 --> 02:51.163
Well, anyway, Hank Fullberg's brother was a good football player.

02:51.143 --> 02:55.588
And he wanted to watch the football game and luckily he sat behind me at the game.

02:56.349 --> 03:04.179
Anyway, Bill and I decided that there were better ways to watch a football game than be a freshman.

03:04.199 --> 03:09.705
And so we got a job taking tickets at the gate.

03:10.346 --> 03:12.809
Oh, and then once you finished taking tickets.

03:13.270 --> 03:14.451
Yeah.

03:14.431 --> 03:21.310
The gates were just open and no one was checking people.

03:21.330 --> 03:29.993
So then he and I would sort of meander down toward the very southwest part of the stadium.

03:29.973 --> 03:32.977
The Corps sat on the east side in the middle part.

03:32.997 --> 03:43.831
And we would go down to the southwest corner and sit with the guys who were the ground keepers and stuff like that down there.

03:43.851 --> 03:50.640
Because in those years, the A&M football games would have about 30,000 people.

03:50.660 --> 03:53.484
And so there was always a lot of vacant space.

03:53.524 --> 03:56.107
Now, did you have on your Corps uniform?

03:56.287 --> 03:58.410
I can't remember.

03:58.390 --> 04:05.301
And you give me the impression that no one ever gave you a hard time for that?

04:05.441 --> 04:06.283
No.

04:06.303 --> 04:07.465
Oh, okay.

04:08.286 --> 04:10.750
Midnight yell practice, was it held in that era?

04:11.271 --> 04:14.717
Yes, before the games.

04:15.157 --> 04:18.062
And we had yell practice every week.

04:18.963 --> 04:24.853
Usually it was just after we'd had our evening supper.

04:24.833 --> 04:30.679
And, of course, we'd have to run over there, you know, not be last.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.442
We were always, the freshmen were always on the first two or three rows.

04:34.063 --> 04:45.796
And it was at Goodwin Hall on the north steps that the yellow leaders stood on the top of them.

04:45.816 --> 04:51.162
And then we would be, the freshmen would be on the first three or four or five rows, six rows.

04:51.142 --> 04:58.673
And we'd be sure, you know, and there'd be a sort of an umbrella of upperclassmen in the background and sides and so forth.

04:59.755 --> 05:03.020
And actually Yale practice was okay.

05:03.561 --> 05:11.192
Summarize, if you can, the impact the World War II veterans made on the campus.

05:11.172 --> 05:13.819
Well, they, of course, were more mature.

05:15.304 --> 05:19.295
Not most, but probably half of them were married.

05:21.822 --> 05:26.194
And they lived in some housing, apartment housing.

05:26.174 --> 05:43.033
It was old army barracks converted, primarily north of University Drive, across from the expanse where the soccer games and the bonfire are held.

05:44.254 --> 05:51.642
And then, of course, they lived all over both communities in apartments and houses.

05:51.622 --> 05:56.755
A certain number of the dormitories were set aside for single veterans.

05:57.578 --> 06:09.329
And the cadet corps occupied the dorm 1 through 12 area, but the other dorms were set aside for single veterans.

06:10.209 --> 06:27.585
The veterans, as a group, were obviously more mature and had had, you know, one to four years of military duty, and many of them came back as very dedicated students.

06:27.565 --> 06:46.003
And, which I might add was a difficult group to compete with for those of us who were freshmen living in the Corps, because we had our freshman duties and we were younger too, but.

06:46.964 --> 06:56.513
Now, if I had looked at a, at the cross-section of the student body, I would have seen then more than half of the student body in civilian clothing?

06:56.533 --> 06:57.454
That's correct.

06:57.434 --> 07:00.600
Because almost none of these veterans were in the Corps, were they?

07:00.620 --> 07:02.804
That's right, yeah.

07:02.824 --> 07:11.721
There was one unit of veterans who wanted to go ahead and get a military commission, and I think only one unit.

07:11.742 --> 07:19.797
There may have been two, but they represented, meaning one floor, one dormitory, 12 dormitories.

07:19.777 --> 07:27.606
And there may have been a few veterans, the band or something, but the veterans were, most of them were civilian students.

07:29.067 --> 07:32.451
Now, if a man had been an officer, he could not be a cadet.

07:32.471 --> 07:33.152
Oh, could not be.

07:33.172 --> 07:37.437
Or if you had been a lieutenant or above, you could not be a cadet.

07:37.777 --> 07:43.303
If you had been an enlisted man, you could then take officer training if you wanted to, you know.

07:43.283 --> 07:49.755
All right, sophomore year on, you live at home, so you walk to and from the campus.

07:49.775 --> 07:50.437
And bicycle.

07:50.577 --> 07:51.779
Okay, bicycle.

07:52.961 --> 07:56.989
And when you weren't in class, what was your routine then?

07:58.488 --> 08:00.610
Where did you spend that extra time?

08:02.112 --> 08:05.135
Well, actually, as a pre-med student, you were in class most of the time.

08:05.816 --> 08:11.863
Because your laboratories, you were taking, as a sophomore, you were taking physics, chemistry.

08:11.883 --> 08:15.527
I'd taken comparative anatomy and biology that summer.

08:15.607 --> 08:19.492
But, you know, these represented a half day each.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.175
And then, plus your lectures.

08:22.195 --> 08:24.858
So you really were in class most of the time.

08:24.898 --> 08:27.921
Now, I would go to the library some.

08:27.901 --> 08:40.267
And I guess if we had a little time between classes, we might sit out on the portico of the porch of the old science hall or something.

08:40.888 --> 08:46.500
Where'd you eat lunch?

08:46.818 --> 09:08.539
Of course, as a freshman in the Duncan Hall, after that, there was a little hamburger stand, a wooden structure behind the exchange store.

09:08.992 --> 09:12.698
And that apparently dated back to the 1920s.

09:12.918 --> 09:17.104
And it was still operational in the 1940s.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.848
And you could get a hamburger or a sandwich or something there.

09:20.569 --> 09:31.506
And I guess that's where I'd usually, if I were on campus, you know, at 11 o'clock class, finished at 12 and then was going back at 1.

09:33.022 --> 09:35.889
Let's see.

09:37.131 --> 09:37.552
And you?

09:38.134 --> 09:50.001
There was also something called Casey's in the bottom of the YMCA, in one of the semicircular sides, basement level.

09:50.791 --> 09:57.097
And I can remember that mainly as a child, because we'd go in and get a chocolate milk or something.

09:57.958 --> 10:00.641
And I think it was still open when I was a freshman.

10:00.681 --> 10:02.743
We could go there, too.

10:02.763 --> 10:05.846
It closed as time went on.

10:05.866 --> 10:17.558
In terms of make up the student body, using a currently politically correct word, diversity, what kind of diversity was there in the student body then?

10:20.390 --> 10:21.592
Very little.

10:22.112 --> 10:23.294
Were there some Jewish students?

10:24.696 --> 10:24.976
Yes.

10:25.717 --> 10:27.760
There was one pre-med I went through with.

10:27.820 --> 10:28.421
He was Jewish.

10:28.621 --> 10:34.550
Do you remember anybody ever giving that youngster anything negative by being Jewish?

10:35.070 --> 10:37.474
No, I do not remember ever having that happen.

10:37.494 --> 10:38.415
Hispanic?

10:39.290 --> 10:41.073
Yes, some.

10:41.613 --> 10:43.817
Not many, but some.

10:43.837 --> 10:44.878
International students?

10:47.001 --> 11:03.205
Some, but most of them were graduate level, and any of them always had graduate students from overseas, but not a lot of undergraduate students at that point.

11:03.185 --> 11:25.530
We'll comment on the one Jewish student, Archie Leder, who could verbally handle himself very well, but I don't think he ever had any, in my presence, any, you know, unfortunate people who were negative toward him.

11:25.690 --> 11:29.074
Many students then had a nickname, did you?

11:29.054 --> 11:33.161
Of course my nickname was Rusty from on, and I was still called Rusty.

11:33.181 --> 11:34.883
So you were Rusty?

11:34.903 --> 11:35.544
Yeah.

11:35.564 --> 11:41.374
Melvin Maltz told me that he was Jew boy, but he did not see it as a put down.

11:41.394 --> 11:41.654
Yeah.

11:42.555 --> 11:50.488
Do you remember any others that in today's circumstances somebody would say, oh, that was negative, but they would say, no, no, it wasn't intended to be negative?

11:53.523 --> 11:56.066
Well, you know, I don't remember.

11:56.106 --> 12:01.613
Once you put the uniform on, you pretty much were all the same.

12:01.673 --> 12:02.474
You were included.

12:03.094 --> 12:10.063
In my outfit, Herschel Maltz, speaking of Melvin, Herschel was in my outfit as a freshman.

12:10.523 --> 12:20.475
And Herschel was not a shrinking violet at all and was well accepted.

12:20.455 --> 12:24.662
And I'm assuming it would be, okay, so he's Jewish, so what?

12:24.762 --> 12:26.886
You're Presbyterian, so what?

12:26.906 --> 12:40.830
Now the student body at that time was, did anyone really even know whether this young man was a white collar or a blue collar, poor or well-to-do, did he?

12:41.431 --> 12:41.772
No.

12:43.017 --> 12:48.844
And yes, most Texans then lived in small towns.

12:49.085 --> 12:52.709
We were in rural states, so I presume the student body reflected that.

12:53.671 --> 12:58.457
And pre-med, but your major was what?

12:58.477 --> 12:59.098
Biology.

12:59.138 --> 12:59.618
Biology.

13:00.299 --> 13:01.941
And you went the full four years.

13:02.142 --> 13:03.423
Correct.

13:05.105 --> 13:05.546
Let's see.

13:05.826 --> 13:10.212
And you didn't spend your year out at Bryan Field.

13:10.232 --> 13:11.033
That comes later.

13:11.013 --> 13:26.136
No, Brian Field, my first year, half the freshman cadets were here at the main campus and half were at Brian Field.

13:26.116 --> 13:46.682
And one of the things that so skylighted it, but anyway pointed out the problems in the Cadet Corps was that 44 percent of the freshmen in upper class units on campus did not come back for the second semester.

13:47.102 --> 13:47.903
Forty-four percent.

13:48.003 --> 13:51.027
For the second semester, not the second year.

13:51.007 --> 13:52.248
That was in 46?

13:52.488 --> 13:54.310
That fall of 46, yeah.

13:54.430 --> 14:02.397
Only about 6% or the amount of the freshmen at Bryan Field did not come back.

14:04.559 --> 14:08.222
And so there was a lot of, actually there was a lot of turmoil.

14:08.442 --> 14:20.052
And I might add some of the veterans who were not cadets necessarily were among those who, you know, wanted the system as it was and they were sort of,

14:20.993 --> 14:30.090
I think influencing the cadet corps company commanders and battery commanders to be tougher and that sort of thing.

14:30.110 --> 14:38.125
Anyway, there was a lot of turmoil, and that led to the investigation by the legislature that spring.

14:38.105 --> 14:42.314
Now, when is that famous march on President Gilchrist's house?

14:43.115 --> 14:45.620
You know, it was in the cooler part of the year.

14:47.163 --> 14:49.368
Was it your 46, 47 year?

14:49.448 --> 14:49.689
Yes.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.234
And I can't remember if it was.

14:52.254 --> 14:57.244
I think it was after Christmas in January of 47, I think.

14:57.224 --> 15:19.005
It would have been sort of that time, and I know we were all, the Cadet Corps was formed in their units in the area where we're normally formed to march into the West Hall, and then we marched instead of the West Hall to the President's home.

15:19.806 --> 15:25.071
And I was actually in a position, just by chance, my unit was in a position to see

15:25.051 --> 15:27.994
whoever it was walk up to give interest.

15:28.014 --> 15:32.338
He walked out of the front door on the porch of the old president's house.

15:33.018 --> 15:36.241
And I presume they were resigning their commissions.

15:36.701 --> 15:39.584
I mean, those of us who were freshmen, we didn't know what was happening.

15:39.984 --> 15:46.350
I mean, this was just sort of a, we knew that it was a protest of some sort, but we didn't know the details of it.

15:46.370 --> 15:55.058
Based on what you now know about that event, what did he do that was positive and what

15:55.038 --> 15:57.521
Did he make any mistakes in his handling of it?

15:58.442 --> 15:59.743
He was pretty firm, wasn't he?

15:59.763 --> 16:00.384
Yes, very.

16:02.006 --> 16:03.067
I know he told me once.

16:04.889 --> 16:08.853
He was a person, a great planter and a great executor of plans.

16:09.814 --> 16:11.316
A very fine administrator.

16:12.217 --> 16:21.147
And if he had an Achilles heel, it was public relations.

16:22.004 --> 16:35.063
And I might add, I think that's one reason the chancellor's position was set up, that he could do what he could do and somebody like Tom Harrington, who loved people, could meet the public.

16:36.845 --> 16:44.316
But Gibb Yelchrist once told me, he said that one of the, I think, board people had told him, Gibb,

16:45.443 --> 16:55.817
Rather than just cutting some reporter off short, just say, I have nothing to say, and then add, at this time.

16:56.658 --> 16:59.241
Because that meant I might talk to you later.

17:00.763 --> 17:02.385
But I still remember that.

17:02.405 --> 17:04.308
But his public relations were not good.

17:04.348 --> 17:06.891
And he was quite firm as dean of engineering.

17:06.931 --> 17:13.560
If a student had done poorly and went in to complain to the dean, he could not expect a lot of sympathy.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.002
And the grade would stand.

17:15.203 --> 17:20.512
This march occurred at the President's house across the street from Sbisa Hall.

17:22.014 --> 17:28.606
And so we have many hundreds of students out there milling around outside.

17:29.227 --> 17:29.868
Let's see.

17:29.888 --> 17:32.933
This was in front of the President's home, not Sbisa.

17:32.973 --> 17:33.374
No, no.

17:33.394 --> 17:34.415
Near Sbisa.

17:34.736 --> 17:35.397
Yes.

17:35.377 --> 17:39.965
And it was... We were more or less where the chapel is now, in the streets there.

17:40.045 --> 17:41.648
And it was in the evening, wasn't it?

17:41.788 --> 17:43.691
Yes, it was after dark.

17:44.973 --> 17:45.995
All right.

17:46.035 --> 17:47.818
Life on an all-male campus.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.765
Where did a young undergraduate find a date?

17:53.129 --> 17:58.094
Well, of course, if you grew up here, then you knew some of the girls in town.

17:58.434 --> 18:08.003
And for the other youngsters, they would have dates come down from TFCW or Baylor or up from Navasota or places like that.

18:08.063 --> 18:16.491
And, of course, there were student dances and that sort of thing and football games when people, dates would be there and so on.

18:16.511 --> 18:19.474
Would the local high school age girls

18:19.893 --> 18:23.321
at A&M Consolidated or Bryan High, did they date the campus?

18:23.341 --> 18:24.244
Some did, yes.

18:24.264 --> 18:25.547
Not all, but some did, yeah.

18:26.790 --> 18:33.005
And quite often when the young ladies from out of town came to town, they stayed at faculty.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.509
That's right.

18:34.529 --> 18:36.754
Did your family ever have any?

18:36.734 --> 18:47.798
I can remember my mother grew up in Navasota, so parents who mother knew if their daughter was coming up, they would often stay with us, yeah.

18:48.058 --> 18:51.265
Would faculty families charge rent or was it just a favor?

18:51.566 --> 18:54.372
I think it was just a favor, yeah.

18:54.392 --> 18:56.717
I don't think rent was charged, yeah.

18:56.697 --> 19:05.274
And I know at least once or twice a student would come to the door and say, Mrs. Anderson, I have my date coming, and would you please let her stay?

19:05.354 --> 19:17.659
And I know there was a watercolor painting in our home that one of the, I guess, architecture students had given the mother after she had said yes, you know, to that.

19:18.888 --> 19:22.874
Let's see, they came normally by the train?

19:22.894 --> 19:24.236
Yes.

19:24.256 --> 19:32.649
Of course, later, really after the war, there was a lot that came by train still, but there was also automobile transportation.

19:32.929 --> 19:33.050
Right.

19:33.070 --> 19:35.293
Now, was it during that era that

19:36.067 --> 19:41.695
a whole trainload of TSCW students would come down on a certain weekend?

19:42.836 --> 19:43.397
I guess so.

19:43.958 --> 19:48.584
I didn't date any of the TSCW students, so I don't, but yes, I think so.

19:49.004 --> 19:55.233
What would have been the events that would have been particularly special date events?

19:55.253 --> 19:57.055
The ring dance was the big dance, yeah.

19:57.075 --> 19:57.396
Okay.

19:58.978 --> 20:02.282
And the cotton ball?

20:02.342 --> 20:05.787
Cotton ball was another.

20:05.767 --> 20:14.565
My big experience with the cotton ball was as about a six-year-old, Helen Mackey and I were the two little ones.

20:15.186 --> 20:21.840
I don't know if we carried the rings or the crowns or what, but it was a photo.

20:22.441 --> 20:26.610
We used to continue to get a Christmas card from

20:26.590 --> 20:36.088
The Stefan daughter of a seal, sale, she was the queen or a duchess or something.

20:37.771 --> 20:43.121
But I think because of that, for many years we got a Christmas card from that.

20:43.141 --> 20:43.602
Right.

20:43.622 --> 20:45.966
If you didn't have a car, how did you get to Bryan?

20:48.545 --> 20:54.332
Well, living here, I had something like that available to me.

20:54.352 --> 20:56.414
Now, I don't really know how everybody else got there.

20:56.434 --> 20:57.275
I guess there was a bus.

20:57.355 --> 20:58.176
I don't know.

20:58.196 --> 21:01.500
Because they didn't hitchhike much to Bryan.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.623
I presume it was longer distance.

21:03.643 --> 21:06.426
I imagine you, I'm sure there was a bus, I'm sure.

21:07.107 --> 21:13.114
But, oh, many years ago before, I remember before I was born, there was an interurban trolley sort of thing.

21:13.154 --> 21:14.155
But that has gone.

21:14.175 --> 21:15.217
It faded out by the 20s.

21:15.237 --> 21:18.180
Is that right?

21:18.160 --> 21:28.423
If you were going off campus for fun, respectable fun, where did students go?

21:31.053 --> 21:36.802
Well, Franklin's was sort of a dance nightclub sort of place.

21:36.822 --> 21:37.624
Where was it?

21:37.644 --> 21:52.748
It was more or less where the West Bypass crosses University Drive out in the west.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.272
Near where the airport is.

21:55.252 --> 21:56.860
Near where the airport is?

21:56.980 --> 21:59.030
Yes, on the north side of the road.

21:59.512 --> 21:59.954
Franklin.

22:00.638 --> 22:03.692
Was that a, would we today call it a dance hall?

22:04.465 --> 22:06.849
Well, it was not called a dance hall.

22:06.909 --> 22:09.613
It was sort of, it might have been called a club.

22:09.693 --> 22:10.354
I don't know.

22:10.855 --> 22:15.302
It had interior areas for dining and a bar.

22:15.582 --> 22:21.051
And it had sort of a semicircular dance area outside too.

22:21.592 --> 22:26.119
Was there any place where there was a band every weekend?

22:26.099 --> 22:28.142
Alive music?

22:30.506 --> 22:32.550
Gosh, Haskell, I don't remember on a weekly basis.

22:32.570 --> 22:33.431
I've never heard of it.

22:33.652 --> 22:43.288
Now, the Grove area on campus, just west of the drill field, had movies and dances and that sort of thing.

22:43.829 --> 22:43.929
Yeah.

22:43.949 --> 22:44.871
Outside sort of things.

22:44.991 --> 22:45.231
Right.

22:45.972 --> 22:51.702
What off-campus places of questionable reputation were there where students went?

22:53.825 --> 23:01.736
There really weren't many places, but there was a place called Hardlicker's, H-R-D-L-I-C-K-A.

23:01.756 --> 23:02.878
Uncle Ed's.

23:03.098 --> 23:04.380
Wasn't that also Uncle Ed's?

23:04.460 --> 23:06.283
Yeah.

23:06.363 --> 23:12.171
When we moved off campus, we moved to 501 Fairview.

23:13.838 --> 23:29.791
And we were not on the direct route between the campus and Hard Liquors, but sometimes some of the kids who maybe had had a few extra beers deviated from the shortest course back home and wandered over to Fairview, and you could hear them singing or making a little noise.

23:30.393 --> 23:33.339
But that was just a place you could get a few beers.

23:33.359 --> 23:34.902
It wasn't too much on that.

23:34.882 --> 23:36.527
It was over on the Welburn Road.

23:36.607 --> 23:37.951
Yes.

23:37.971 --> 23:42.122
And it wasn't a, he didn't run a bootleg opera.

23:42.162 --> 23:44.308
He didn't, it was just beer.

23:44.328 --> 23:45.572
That's right, yeah.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.457
Was Whiskey Bridge yet

23:48.145 --> 23:52.730
a reality going to Burleson County to buy something just across the river?

23:53.391 --> 23:56.455
Yes, that was a reality in the 1930s.

23:58.597 --> 24:06.106
Because I think there may have been more than one store over there, sort of one went broke and another one succeeded it.

24:06.166 --> 24:08.729
So I mean they date back at least to the 1930s.

24:10.851 --> 24:14.035
Was there a bootlegger that anybody knew of here in

24:14.673 --> 24:18.264
Not an official one.

24:18.284 --> 24:21.232
I think I told you a story about my dad making some beer once.

24:21.493 --> 24:21.894
Yes, yes.

24:21.914 --> 24:27.872
But there may have been somebody who was trying to make a dollar out of it.

24:28.342 --> 24:35.895
But I think otherwise people just occasionally brood something at home, maybe on campus.

24:36.817 --> 24:42.928
All right, let me refer briefly to an anecdote about my Missouri experience.

24:43.549 --> 24:53.286
I learned after I got up there that the fellow who wrote, I wonder what's going on behind the green door, that famous song, had attended the University of Missouri.

24:53.705 --> 25:00.892
and there was a place at a certain location downtown up a flight of steps and there was a green door.

25:00.912 --> 25:01.012
Yeah.

25:01.032 --> 25:03.875
And there was a lot that went on behind the green door.

25:03.915 --> 25:04.155
Yeah, yeah.

25:04.435 --> 25:10.501
Now, was there any house of ill repute in Brazos County that... Not that I know of.

25:10.521 --> 25:13.204
Now, there may have been something in North Bryan or someplace.

25:13.284 --> 25:16.948
I don't know, but... Let's see.

25:19.190 --> 25:19.290
Okay.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.665
See, students drank beer.

25:27.149 --> 25:29.174
Did they drink much of anything else?

25:29.635 --> 25:32.421
Not much, no.

25:32.441 --> 25:32.622
Okay.

25:32.642 --> 25:40.540
I'm sure that somebody would have a whiskey or a highball or a mixed drink, but I think beer was the main item, yeah.

25:40.841 --> 25:41.683
And beer.

25:42.102 --> 25:46.532
the only one wherever I went on first-year occasions.

25:46.592 --> 25:49.699
And they would have to hide it if they had it in their room.

25:51.062 --> 25:51.624
All right.

25:51.744 --> 25:55.352
Tobacco, how common was smoking among young men then?

25:57.779 --> 26:00.763
Well, I don't remember a lot of people smoking, frankly.

26:02.706 --> 26:07.533
I just don't remember people smoking.

26:08.635 --> 26:12.220
I didn't smoke, so, you know, I just didn't notice it.

26:12.240 --> 26:16.626
And in almost every case, it was cigarettes, not cigars.

26:17.587 --> 26:19.450
Did students smoke pipes?

26:20.746 --> 26:30.081
I don't remember, and I think one of my 1950 or so annual, it showed, is it?

26:30.922 --> 26:39.431
a fellow named Lindley, who was a little older veteran with a pipe in his hand, or if not his mouth.

26:40.432 --> 26:49.301
He was, I think, the co-editor of the Aggieland, or editor of the battalion one of the two.

26:49.441 --> 26:54.866
But, I mean, I remember that picture because it was sort of unusual, you know, to see a student with a pipe.

26:55.107 --> 26:57.469
Did students chew tobacco, dip snuff?

26:59.153 --> 27:08.627
Some chewed tobacco, but not, you know, some of the guys from the agricultural areas, but not much.

27:09.288 --> 27:16.158
What did you and your friends know about what we would today call drugs?

27:16.178 --> 27:17.179
Well, I knew zero.

27:17.860 --> 27:19.643
Did you even know the terminology?

27:20.990 --> 27:23.674
Did you know what a heroin or marijuana was?

27:23.814 --> 27:25.777
I didn't know the word.

27:25.797 --> 27:28.801
Well, I don't know that I did either, really, when I think of it.

27:29.422 --> 27:32.286
But it just didn't exist as far as I was concerned.

27:32.306 --> 27:36.372
And I'm sure that I would have had some idea of it happening if it had been used.

27:40.198 --> 27:41.139
Let's see, court trips.

27:41.219 --> 27:43.723
Did you make some court trips?

27:44.598 --> 27:47.241
A few, yes.

27:47.261 --> 27:51.287
Well, the story of the first court trip when I was a freshman was the TCU game.

27:53.009 --> 27:59.638
And so, of course, all the guys in the outfit were supposed to go, and so I mentioned that to Dad.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.600
He said, no, you'll stay here and study.

28:04.404 --> 28:05.405
This is a former coach.

28:05.425 --> 28:06.146
This is a coach.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.568
Yes, yes, yes.

28:08.307 --> 28:10.590
But yeah, I went to some court trips.

28:10.991 --> 28:15.357
I can remember marching up Congress Avenue in Austin and that sort of thing.

28:16.438 --> 28:26.532
You know, we marched up from more or less the river to the capital, which is, I might add, an incline upward, too.

28:27.533 --> 28:35.344
In general, what was the reaction on all the court trips of the people standing on the curbs watching?

28:37.822 --> 28:39.425
Well, I think it was positive.

28:39.445 --> 28:40.868
They were interested, yeah.

28:40.888 --> 28:42.452
That's what I assumed it would be.

28:44.516 --> 28:49.406
You know, we weren't just being, there wasn't a standing ovation or anything of that sort.

28:49.446 --> 28:51.310
But I mean, yeah, people were interested in it.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.132
Now, how did you get?

28:52.152 --> 28:53.775
Particularly when the band would go by.

28:53.796 --> 28:56.421
How did you get to those places?

28:57.177 --> 29:05.631
Well, actually, you were just told to be somewhere at a certain time, and you arranged your own transportation.

29:06.092 --> 29:12.724
And usually somebody would, you know, not many people really had cars, but for those occasions somebody would have a car.

29:13.846 --> 29:19.195
It may have come from somebody's parents' home or something, and then everybody would pile in and go, you know.

29:19.816 --> 29:22.881
And you'd spend the Friday night there.

29:23.452 --> 29:30.366
Well, actually, yes you could, or you could, you know, you might just drive over early in the morning.

29:31.248 --> 29:33.733
I was thinking, yeah, Austin or Houston.

29:34.014 --> 29:37.140
Austin and Baylor, they were close by.

29:38.383 --> 29:44.616
Fort Worth was a little different, of course.

29:44.596 --> 29:45.037
All right.

29:45.117 --> 29:56.338
Football game day, you told me that you and a friend learned to beat the system by working so that you didn't have all of that quite the same routine.

29:56.358 --> 29:58.102
We didn't get as much voice training.

29:58.122 --> 29:58.602
Yeah.

29:58.623 --> 29:58.883
All right.

29:58.903 --> 30:01.708
As a junior and senior, were you in the Corps or did you?

30:02.330 --> 30:03.071
No.

30:03.091 --> 30:06.317
I applied for a field artillery.

30:06.297 --> 30:14.365
contract is not commission, but contract, which would lead to a commission.

30:15.148 --> 30:17.978
And I actually didn't pass the physical examination.

30:19.139 --> 30:23.366
And they were going to waver me with the artillery.

30:23.406 --> 30:34.885
Didn't want anybody who was a pre-med who wasn't, you know, perfect physically.

30:34.905 --> 30:42.497
And so I remember the young officer said to me, well, why don't you

30:42.477 --> 30:50.869
try, since you're pre-med, not going to be a line officer, why don't you try the quartermaster?"

30:50.889 --> 30:58.580
I thought, good gosh, my dad would throw me out if I weren't in something related to being a line officer.

30:58.600 --> 31:11.438
So I went by the Irr-Murder cavalry office, since my uncle had been in the cavalry, to see if

31:11.418 --> 31:13.924
That could be arranged and nobody was there.

31:13.945 --> 31:18.336
And I decided, well, heck, I just won't be anything, you know.

31:18.356 --> 31:21.163
So I was not a cadet the last two years.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.727
And your dad didn't object?

31:22.747 --> 31:23.790
No.
