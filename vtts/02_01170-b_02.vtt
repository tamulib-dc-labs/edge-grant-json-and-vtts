WEBVTT

00:03.558 --> 00:16.236
about the low level of support when, in these 
restricted times, there's vastly more money

00:03.558 --> 00:16.236
available than the old bailing wire and sealing 
wax days at Lowell. Yeah. I mean, when I went to

00:17.177 --> 00:32.839
Lowell, I mean, typical salary level, I don't 
remember what I was paid, but it's less than we pay a

00:17.177 --> 00:32.839
graduate student assistant coming in now

00:17.177 --> 00:32.839
who's supposedly spending most of his time just 
studying. so uh yeah and those of us who've held

00:33.393 --> 01:01.088
positions for a long time i've been 30 years now or 
going on 30 years at university of arizona our

00:33.393 --> 01:01.088
salaries have fallen behind uh so it's called the 
compression effect uh considerably behind uh new

00:33.393 --> 01:01.088
appointees so it's only because well i've been in i 
mean my house is paid for so i don't have to pay a big

00:33.393 --> 01:01.088
mortgage and so in a sense i feel that i'm I can 
afford to draw this salary, but

01:01.439 --> 01:13.653
I think there's too much focus and too much 
attention on short-term science, new people

01:01.439 --> 01:13.653
coming in. They have to move very rapidly. You've 
got to publish results very quickly, pick up, I

01:16.936 --> 01:26.387
think, many, many superficial things. In-depth 
science has suffered. And I don't think there's a

01:28.793 --> 01:37.321
proper balance of support for deeper studies, 
more controversial studies.

01:41.484 --> 01:46.969
So I don't have a lot of sympathy for the complaints 
of many of the younger scientists. I don't think

01:47.409 --> 01:58.159
that's the

01:47.409 --> 01:58.159
central problem that we face in astronomy. I think 
we're overpopulated with astronomy, and I think

01:59.000 --> 02:05.126
we're driven by to produce results quickly. I'm an 
old-fashioned astronomer who believes that the

02:06.187 --> 02:16.578
way Mount Wilson and places like that worked years 
ago, where you could study a problem, think about

02:06.187 --> 02:16.578
it, and publish a definitive analysis. I mean, the 
kind of work that Merrill did and Joy and so on,

02:16.598 --> 02:27.910
those I think, that's the way I still think there's 
room for that kind of support in astronomy. And we

02:28.058 --> 02:30.601
see very little of it. I want to ask you one general, 
one specific question. The specific one is,

02:34.566 --> 02:41.595
what's the reaction of people that you meet when 
they find out you're an astronomer? Good, bad, and

02:41.615 --> 02:43.077
different surprises? I think the general public 
is well attuned to astronomy. And I don't think

02:47.002 --> 02:48.784
we've ever had a problem selling astronomy 
fundamentally, gee, there's a lot of

02:49.456 --> 03:05.398
misunderstanding of what astronomy is, but I 
think there's an automatic, fairly positive

02:49.456 --> 03:05.398
reaction to astronomy because, gee, yeah, I mean, 
it's telling us what's out there, and there's a

02:49.456 --> 03:05.398
natural interest in that. I don't think there's 
any problem at that level with getting an initial

03:05.979 --> 03:13.489
positive reaction to astronomy. It's at the next 
level when you start asking for money or

03:14.482 --> 03:21.332
explaining how expensive it is to run this 
business that people get a little puzzled. And

03:21.412 --> 03:31.307
well, even then, well, just if you give us the 
proper information or proper justification,

03:21.412 --> 03:31.307
maybe we're not fundamentally objecting to it. I 
think we have more problem internally in

03:31.327 --> 03:37.116
astronomy in the way we've decided to allocate our 
resources. And I can be perfectly honest in making

03:37.136 --> 03:43.105
one of the strong comparisons I'm sure has been 
made many times between the way say NRAO and NOAO

03:43.338 --> 03:47.362
are run. NRAO is a real service institution that 
really helps astronomers with individual ideas.

03:53.387 --> 03:55.669
And it doesn't get any complaints either. Right. 
It's a great institution. And the controversy

03:57.851 --> 04:04.537
that revolves around NOAO, I'm not an authority on 
that, but it's an entirely different situation.

04:04.557 --> 04:07.520
But you live in Tucson, right?

04:10.762 --> 04:12.484
That's the way things are funded now. I mean, if you 
want to do a research program or do an observing

04:12.565 --> 04:25.337
program or apply for a grant, you have got to say 
exactly what you're going to do and exactly what

04:12.565 --> 04:25.337
you're going to find. But of course, in the kind of 
work that I do, you can't do that. I mean, we're

04:29.401 --> 04:32.464
investigating a phenomena that we don't 
understand. And historically, that's where the

04:32.524 --> 04:37.670
major advances in science have come. I think if you 
look at the history of science, and I'm no

04:41.742 --> 04:46.529
authority on history of science like you are, Ron, 
but... Not yet. It's not out of these big

04:46.589 --> 05:00.951
institutions, necessarily, that the real 
advances come, because the proposals are

04:46.589 --> 05:00.951
reviewed in such microscopic detail that there 
really isn't any question left. It's just

05:00.971 --> 05:04.856
refining the next significant figure or 
something like that. It's only the tenured

05:05.437 --> 05:10.585
professors with some far-out idea or people that 
are willing to take a big risk they can investigate

05:10.750 --> 05:34.969
the unknown and take on an observing program or do 
an observing program where they don't know what

05:10.750 --> 05:34.969
they're gonna find because you can't write that 
kind of proposal nobody's gonna fund it nobody's

05:10.750 --> 05:34.969
gonna support it Galileo wouldn't stand a chance 
today no I mean to build a telescope I mean

05:10.750 --> 05:34.969
everybody knew what you're gonna see when you 
looked at Jupiter or something It wasn't going to

05:35.675 --> 05:38.599
have moon circling around it. There was nothing 
unknown out there. So you can't write that kind of

05:42.645 --> 05:45.168
proposal. And I think that's exactly the kind of 
proposal that we need. The same is true for

05:51.417 --> 05:52.939
publication. When you send a paper in to the 
Astrophysical Journal or to a main journal, I've

05:52.979 --> 06:04.315
had plenty of experience with this, where you try 
to develop a new idea. or suggest a new

06:05.088 --> 06:07.111
interpretation. If it's inconsistent with what 
is, quote, presently known or presently being

06:08.013 --> 06:19.391
modeled, you're going to meet immense 
resistance. And to introduce a new or a different

06:19.411 --> 06:24.139
idea is very, very difficult. You can't do it. I 
can't work with graduate students or people that

06:26.162 --> 06:32.192
future depend upon their being able to get a job 
that having connection with TIFF is not wise. I can

06:39.702 --> 06:57.880
do it because I've got tenure, because I've got 
security, and because my salary is big enough that

06:39.702 --> 06:57.880
my expenses aren't that big, I can afford to go to 
the AAS meeting and have my own home computer and a

06:39.702 --> 06:57.880
few computer programs so I can generate poster 
papers, I can write papers. I may even end up having

06:57.981 --> 07:02.365
to pick up some of my publication charges. There 
aren't many people in a position to do that.

07:06.722 --> 07:10.625
There's something wrong with the way science is 
being supported and funded. I don't think we need a

07:10.706 --> 07:18.612
lot of money for this, but I think there ought to be 
means of handling new ideas. We ought to somehow

07:19.273 --> 07:30.623
try to create a means of supporting new ideas based 
upon just the experience with the people. People

07:31.724 --> 07:32.925
know that I do good observational work.

07:37.258 --> 07:40.321
There ought to be a means of supporting these kinds 
of things. I'm not speaking specifically for

07:40.361 --> 07:43.905
myself, but I know there are a lot of people out 
there. I assume this criticism applies to NSF and

07:43.925 --> 07:54.338
NASA together in that they are both unwilling to 
take any chances whatsoever. Right. I mean,

07:54.918 --> 07:59.824
Jocelyn Gill's office, for example, and this was 
an aspect of the older NASA, was willing to take

08:00.125 --> 08:05.831
this kind of risk in the Lunar Programs Lab and 
Marshall Space Flight Center. They said, yeah. I

08:07.212 --> 08:09.014
mean, sure, they were vested interest in this. But 
on the other hand, there were no strings attached

08:09.195 --> 08:11.797
to the support. They say, go out and build some good 
programs that we can fly. Sure, they were

08:16.102 --> 08:17.043
interested. They wanted programs developed. But 
they gave the support to people who were motivated

08:18.544 --> 08:24.831
to try something new. We don't see much of that now. 
and this collecting of everybody into teams to do a

08:27.817 --> 08:34.103
specific job, there's no flexibility. There's no 
ability of the scientists to develop a completely

08:34.483 --> 08:39.088
new idea. We've seen these plateaus in the history 
of science frequently. Everything is known, and

08:42.711 --> 08:50.399
all we've got to do is work out the next details. We 
aren't any closer to the final answers than we were

08:54.563 --> 08:59.376
We're in the 18th century, but a lot of people think 
we are.
