00:00.841 --> 00:12.760
And she sees the struggle of our times as a struggle 
for survival and whether we're going to go on to

00:00.841 --> 00:12.760
become that kind of grand human species implicit 
in what we already are. It's interesting to those,

00:14.082 --> 00:24.598
I'm sure, people who've had similar experiences 
who've taught the book, what students' responses

00:14.082 --> 00:24.598
are to a work like Starmaker. What typically What I 
get when I teach it, first of all, there's a lot of

00:26.221 --> 00:29.626
moaning and groaning. I warn people about it. I 
say, you know, this is a very difficult work. It

00:33.392 --> 00:35.736
makes tremendous demands on your imagination. I 
can only read about 15 or 20 pages of Star Maker at a

00:36.096 --> 00:40.503
time. I just start getting dizzy from the demands 
that the book makes on me. So one, you've got to read

00:46.993 --> 00:48.376
this slow. You've got to take your time. You have to 
think about it. So you get a lot of complaints. Why

00:51.681 --> 00:52.762
did you sign this book? It's so... long, it's so 
slow, there's no plot, there are no characters, et

00:53.744 --> 00:59.398
cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And then every year 
that I've taught that book, I also have, right

00:59.418 --> 01:08.901
away, there's a small minority that get very 
excited about the book. gradually more people

01:08.881 --> 01:10.563
have won over. And I find later on, months later, 
and sometimes years later, when it's not a matter

01:10.643 --> 01:23.318
of currying favor to get a good grade, years later, 
people come back to see me and say, you remember

01:10.643 --> 01:23.318
that book by Stapleton that you assigned, Star 
Maker? I've never read anything like that. That

01:25.100 --> 01:26.622
book changed my life. It changed the whole way I 
look at myself and human beings and where we are,

01:26.702 --> 01:34.631
what we are, and so on. That book changed my life. 
Well, how many people who've taught paradise laws

01:36.691 --> 01:44.479
have had a response like that from the students? As 
I say, our job is critical. We scholars and critics

01:50.645 --> 01:59.334
of science fiction may help make the choice, and it 
is a critical distinction. It is helping to make a

01:59.834 --> 02:01.416
choice. between the values of the futures 
exchange and the values of, say, the space

02:01.700 --> 02:14.501
merchants, between starship troopers and the 
forever war. Our scholarship and criticism may,

02:16.445 --> 02:26.982
in fact, have an influence on the future that the 
human race chooses to create.

02:56.847 --> 02:57.448
Thank you, Bruce. That was a very good speech. And 
let me personally thank you, not thank you, but

02:58.970 --> 03:12.449
congratulate you on winning this award, a 
well-deserved, well-merited award winner for

02:58.970 --> 03:12.449
our distinguished list of pilgrims. Before we 
leave, I want to discuss just one small matter for a

03:14.031 --> 03:20.340
couple of minutes. I wish I would have had the 
opportunity today to thank another set of guests

03:20.894 --> 03:31.310
that we invited, but unfortunately they could not 
come, and these were the guests from the Soviet

03:20.894 --> 03:31.310
Union. I'd ask for the Strogatzky brothers, of 
course. We met Boris in Leningrad last year, and I

03:36.417 --> 03:45.771
had high hopes that, since a number of science 
fiction people had gone through, that the

03:45.751 --> 03:48.935
writers' union houses there that they might 
reciprocate. And also, that was a means to pry

03:49.015 --> 04:04.331
loose another distinguished Pilgrim winner, a 
world specialist, Julius Kargaletsky, one of our

03:49.015 --> 04:04.331
early Pilgrim winners, who was set to come to pick 
up his award at Penn State, I believe, wasn't it?

04:04.392 --> 04:04.932
Was that 1972? Around in there? And at the last 
moment was sent to Stockholm, I believe, or

04:08.556 --> 04:13.902
someplace like that. And I was hoping this time he 
could get here and we could give him a belated

04:14.388 --> 04:23.917
observance for his winning. But he could not come. 
As a euphemism, they say he has family troubles. A

04:33.767 --> 04:39.653
member of his family apparently is in disfavor and 
that is reflected, of course, on him. So I'm sorry

04:40.325 --> 04:46.230
that our Russian science fiction writers and 
critics and editors did not show up. Since some of

04:47.111 --> 04:54.097
us were written up in Pravda last December, I had 
high hopes that they would show up. But that was not

04:55.078 --> 04:56.339
the case. And so since I can't thank them for 
coming, I will say that I am sorry they couldn't be

04:58.541 --> 05:05.787
here. And perhaps sometime in the future, the 
Soviet government may allow us to finally present

05:09.215 --> 05:16.006
our wayward pilgrim. Thank you very much, and have 
a good time at the rest of the

05:16.527 --> 05:34.817
meeting.
