WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:10.356
things that I recall that were important to him and 
things that he considered important. I made a

00:11.357 --> 00:33.025
speech to the Sol Ross group in March of 91, and I'm 
looking at my notes now, and I had under his

00:11.357 --> 00:33.025
accomplishments in the mid-60s coeducation, 
integration, the name change, the

00:11.357 --> 00:33.025
non-compulsory core, and my comment here was he 
felt he had to sacrifice some of his own

00:33.798 --> 00:37.182
deep-rooted feelings to do what was best for the 
school. And then I told a little story about LBJ and

00:37.682 --> 00:42.888
what his remarks were. I had notes here that 
Beaumont Aggies threatened to burn all their

00:43.689 --> 00:48.314
diplomas. I think one or two actually did. There 
were a few rings and diplomas mailed back. Then I

00:57.864 --> 01:02.910
had state and federal support look at his 
connections, LBJ and the White House, John

00:57.864 --> 01:02.910
Connolly. I had land office to A&M, then Tiger 
Teague and Bill Moore as far as financing. And I

01:11.530 --> 01:16.556
wrote with these connections, A&M had support 
like no other school in America. In the 60s, we were

01:17.798 --> 01:20.641
put on the map of higher education. He was very 
proud of beginning the faculty buildup, the first

01:21.743 --> 01:30.113
National Academy of Sciences faculty member. At 
the time that the Students for a Democratic

01:30.599 --> 01:47.054
Society were disrupting the campus in Colorado 
and at Berkeley, he had Bob Melcher say, Melcher,

01:30.599 --> 01:47.054
oh, some bitch is going to send somebody down here 
to stir us up. And I want you to tell me exactly who

01:48.296 --> 01:51.679
the first one is. And it turns out it was a little 
redheaded boy. And Melcher said, here's your SDS

01:57.584 --> 02:00.387
leader. And he said, I want him in my office 
tomorrow morning. And the little boy was very

02:05.485 --> 02:07.347
nervous. I saw him. And after a discussion which 
went something like this, son, I know who you are. I

02:17.220 --> 02:18.421
know why you're here. And I want you to know that 
what you're hoping to do here is not going to work.

02:27.072 --> 02:31.538
And this fat old man here that's president of this 
school is going to be the first one after you with a

02:31.855 --> 02:36.361
club if you start any kind of disruption. And then 
later, word got out that some SDS colleagues from

02:36.881 --> 02:48.556
Austin were going to come over and disrupt final 
review. And Mr. Rutter saw to it that a story got

02:50.818 --> 02:53.462
out. It did not come from the president's office. 
But it got to the SDS, the little handful that we

02:56.445 --> 03:00.310
had. to the effect that at final review, there 
would be some unmarked vans parked around the

03:00.931 --> 03:06.783
drill field. And the school had nothing to do with 
it. This is just a rumor that they would be filled

03:09.168 --> 03:17.866
with Aggie football players with baseball bats 
just aching to find someone to disrupt final

03:09.168 --> 03:17.866
review. And then no disruption took place. The 
enrollment explosion began, and I did some little

03:21.637 --> 03:27.123
figures here that might be interesting. In the 
decade of the 50s, the total enrollment was up 546

03:27.463 --> 03:32.168
students. Decade of the 60s, it went up to 7,095 
students. In the decade of the 70s, it went up

03:40.557 --> 03:44.461
19,183 students. And I had a little note that I 
signed while I was dean of admissions, 15 years.

03:52.180 --> 03:59.907
90,121 diplomas, which was 58.8% of those awarded 
since 1878. So that was just an example of the

04:00.007 --> 04:04.951
growth. Then on his habits, thoughts, and 
feelings, rudder now. Motto for Aggies, the

04:10.356 --> 04:16.141
difficult we do immediately, the impossible 
takes just a bit longer. I mentioned the smooth

04:17.863 --> 04:20.145
operations with the board. deep and abiding faith 
in former students, closeness unparalleled. And

04:26.237 --> 04:42.197
I remember that one day Mr. Zachary was in his 
office, and things were kind of tough at the time,

04:26.237 --> 04:42.197
and I remember Mr. Zachary stood and said, Earl, 
there'll be times when you're present here that

04:26.237 --> 04:42.197
you're going to need something badly. He said, 
when you want something very badly, whatever it

04:43.920 --> 04:50.588
is, then you call me. As far as you know, did he ever 
do that?

04:58.048 --> 05:02.011
Probably on political support for funding, yes. 
Probably so. Used him for political . Are you aware

05:06.895 --> 05:21.388
of any major

05:06.895 --> 05:21.388
frustrations he had with the board where maybe he 
and the board did not end up agreeing? No. I've

05:23.052 --> 05:24.594
never heard of any. If they had them, they worked 
them out. Things were going really so well, and he

05:28.860 --> 05:34.307
and the board got along so well. They're real, as I 
remember, and I was over there at that building,

05:35.108 --> 05:43.439
you'd hear little comments from Wells or whoever. 
The comments would be things like, Earl, what can

05:45.942 --> 05:50.889
we do for you at this meeting? It was for you. you the 
universal. Now, describe his process, his

05:55.193 --> 06:02.182
political process, for Austin or Washington. How 
did he go about getting things done there? Well, he

06:09.371 --> 06:20.785
had the most marvelous set of contacts you could 
possibly imagine, starting at the top and going

06:09.371 --> 06:20.785
down through the governor and the state senators 
and what have you. I think to start with, he would

06:22.334 --> 06:31.264
call them up and tell them what he had in mind and 
say, is this going to fly? And if it's not, you tell

06:31.585 --> 06:35.649
me what I have to do to make it fly. And he would do it 
directly, not through an intermediary. Usually

06:39.594 --> 06:40.415
not. He knew them as well as. Oh, yeah. Did we have 
anybody officially then representing us? In

06:50.306 --> 06:52.088
Austin, you mean, or Washington? I can't think of 
it. No, no, no, it was one on one as best I can

06:54.533 --> 06:59.838
remember. The, uh, one other little thing on my 
notes here about rudder that I told those boys that

07:00.759 --> 07:20.438
would be a good story for you to have is I was in his 
office one day and I may have told you this before

07:00.759 --> 07:20.438
and Abner McCall called him and he just did like 
this meant to stay there in my chair and they

07:00.759 --> 07:20.438
finished their business on the phone. And 
finally, we were playing Baylor at College

07:20.738 --> 07:25.745
Station that week, and this was like Thursday. And 
he said, Abner, what are those damned old mean

07:27.047 --> 07:35.379
bears of yours going to do to our poor little old 
Aggie Saturday? And he paused, and he nearly fell

07:35.960 --> 07:39.445
out. I've never seen him laugh that hard. But Abner 
McCall, he told me, said, Earl? We're going to beat

07:45.410 --> 07:53.503
the hell out of you, but we're going to do it in a 
Christian-like way.

07:56.448 --> 07:58.331
Your basic question, what was he proudest of? 
Construction of the facilities that we needed. He

08:02.237 --> 08:03.199
got that started. He began the program for getting 
the first few stellar type of faculty. always with

08:12.359 --> 08:20.167
the hope that we could have really good ones that 
kept at the classroom level. He kept harping at

08:20.227 --> 08:21.789
that. And the funding in Austin and otherwise, and 
including former students. He was a marvel with

08:32.080 --> 08:34.702
former students. He would go to their, and not many 
presidents have done this since then, he would go

08:35.183 --> 08:41.910
to their Annual meetings, the executive 
committees, and he would sit there and talk to them

08:42.278 --> 08:52.691
just like we're talking right now. And I don't 
think anyone has really done that that

08:52.711 --> 08:56.556
effectively since then. He paid attention to them 
and made them feel very good, and in turn, he could

08:56.956 --> 09:03.564
call them. You name Beaumont, you name Port 
Arthur, you name a town, he had somebody

09:03.584 --> 09:11.374
influential there that he could call because he 
made himself one of them. And one of the things that

09:12.046 --> 09:18.013
he looked to me for, and Williams did it even more 
than, than Rutter. He wanted me at those meetings,

09:19.375 --> 09:22.618
especially when he couldn't be there. He wanted 
someone from his office there that had his ear. To

09:26.603 --> 09:27.324
represent.

09:29.927 --> 09:30.027
Yeah. Now, uh, during the early sixties, uh, I 
understood that at first, uh, particularly that

09:30.047 --> 09:41.901
year when Marion Pugh was running for the Senate 
against Bill Moore, that supposedly President

09:42.640 --> 09:47.365
Rutter and Moore supposedly were not completely 
in agreement. That's right. But they worked out.

09:51.849 --> 09:52.570
Do you know how that? They kind of clashed on this, 
that, and the other. But they got along well enough

09:57.475 --> 10:07.344
that Moore could say, Earl, I'm going to vote this 
way on a given subject, and here's why. And you're

10:08.906 --> 10:09.947
just going to have to. Bear with me on that. I know 
you don't like it, but I've got to vote. And, but,

10:14.630 --> 10:19.778
but they would talk and say, well, we disagree on 
this, but here's what we're going to do now. Here's

10:19.818 --> 10:22.322
a, where does that thing? I was just going, yeah, 
here's a, was an interesting meeting right here.

10:28.792 --> 10:32.858
That's Evans rudder. And this is when they 
legislature decided they were going to get

10:33.739 --> 10:37.926
involved. and whether or not A&M was 
coeducational. And I am telling you the truth.

10:42.557 --> 10:43.258
What is it? That's my birthday. Oh, it is? That was a 
tough time because they allowed people up in the

10:45.922 --> 10:56.936
bleacher seat, what do you call it, balcony, get up 
and make impassioned talks and this, that, and the

10:45.922 --> 10:56.936
other. But the,

10:57.817 --> 11:07.710
let me get this straight, a very pretty lady set up a 
desk in the hallway leading to the Senate chamber.

11:16.285 --> 11:22.893
And she knew how every one of the senators, what 
position they were going to take on coeducation.

11:22.913 --> 11:27.918
And this lady represented a group opposed to it. 
And as a senator would come up, she would call him

11:30.041 --> 11:38.811
over and suggest that if he needed entertainment 
that night, that if he would vote the right way,

11:39.702 --> 11:43.768
that she could sure damn sure arrange that. That 
was a standing joke. And she was opposed to

11:47.633 --> 11:51.778
coeducation. Now, do you remember? She was with a 
mother's club. Was there a vote? Did they vote? I

11:57.226 --> 11:58.167
think they took. A non-binding? Yeah, a 
non-binding kind of vote. And that's what this

12:03.446 --> 12:07.389
terrible night was there, because it just went 
back and forth. It was just terrible. When it

12:09.471 --> 12:12.574
turned out, what was that non-binding vote? Do you 
remember? No, I don't remember. No,

12:14.415 --> 12:19.540
I better not say. I don't remember. But it was such a 
wishy-washy thing, so mixed up, that it didn't

12:20.240 --> 12:25.084
amount to a hill of beans. And they knew they didn't 
have the rightful authority to make that

12:25.164 --> 12:29.588
decision. Now, I have heard that during that 
period, just by sheer coincidence, that on

12:30.057 --> 12:51.747
certain nights at about 10 o'clock at night, two 
cars would pull up beside each other facing

12:30.057 --> 12:51.747
opposite directions with the driver's side 
windows almost touching in the parking lot just on

12:30.057 --> 12:51.747
the north side of the campus theater. And with 
their lights off, these two total strangers would

12:52.689 --> 12:56.554
chat with each other that one of them happened to be 
a state senator and the other one happened to be a

12:57.277 --> 13:23.453
university president have you ever heard that no i 
heard that that that bill moore and mr rutter

12:57.277 --> 13:23.453
sometimes would chat their person to person face 
to face no i did not if that happened i don't know

12:57.277 --> 13:23.453
about it uh let's see was there any important 
person that mr rudder listened to uh who was a

13:23.905 --> 13:28.909
pronounced opponent of those changes? Any of his 
close friends, advisors?

13:38.458 --> 13:40.259
I've never heard of one. And there was no board 
member who became well known for his opposition.

13:51.029 --> 13:52.410
Once a word came back from LBJ, the way that it did, I 
think people just said, well, what the hell?

13:59.449 --> 13:59.749
Mrs. Rudder's role during those years, describe 
her as the wife and mother.

14:08.119 --> 14:17.170
Whenever I'm around her and there's someone new 
between us there, she will tell them. Edwin here

14:18.291 --> 14:20.794
was the first person at A&M that paid any attention 
to the president's wife. And on his first

14:25.021 --> 14:34.610
function, which was some kind of a little coffee or 
something, he came over to me and said,

14:25.021 --> 14:34.610
everybody's paying attention to the president 
over there. Is anyone paying any attention to you?

14:36.852 --> 14:38.233
And she never forgot that. We had a close 
relationship, the four of us. We went out to their

14:43.298 --> 14:50.224
ranch a couple, three times, dove hunting, the 
four of us, when he just needed to get away. She was

14:50.693 --> 15:01.990
frustrated at him because he did not want to look 
bad on paper in terms of what it cost to operate that

14:50.693 --> 15:01.990
president's home. He tried valiantly and 
succeeded to a large extent to get most of it given.

15:09.361 --> 15:12.946
I think that president's home cost the state of 
Texas $63,000. And he took great pride in that. She

15:18.474 --> 15:20.397
had to operate on a just threadbare basis and the 
board never did appropriate enough money to

15:20.900 --> 15:48.122
operate that thing and yet they they expected to be 
wind and dying there when they when the spirit

15:20.900 --> 15:48.122
moved them and it's it was tough on williams as well 
as rudder now the they were living when you became

15:20.900 --> 15:48.122
the system they were living in the old president's 
house they were the one that burned burned and my

15:20.900 --> 15:48.122
best story about that is when Tiger T, in 
particular, came to see them. He had to have a

15:51.529 --> 15:53.371
bottle of whiskey. That's just the way it is. So Mr. 
Rudder had a Pan Am flight bag with a couple of

15:56.895 --> 16:05.024
bottles of bourbon in it that he hid way back in his 
closet. And he was desperately afraid that the

16:05.124 --> 16:12.572
students or faculty would find out that the 
president had whiskey in his house. And so he hid it

16:13.713 --> 16:16.236
in that Pan Am bag in the night. that Joe and Peggy 
Hollingsworth were married across the street in

16:17.262 --> 16:21.507
the all-face chapel. We were there. And that 
night, later, that place burned. Yes, ma'am? Are

16:25.832 --> 16:26.113
you? OK. You going where? I'm going to a mess. A 
mess? Reunion group. OK. All right. See you later.

16:37.667 --> 16:37.947
Be right back. The fire started between the 
chimney and the frame. And the rudders got back

16:42.572 --> 16:47.218
from wherever they were while she was really 
boiling up in flame and in spite of warnings from

16:47.435 --> 17:01.755
the fire people, he roared into that house and 
retrieved that Pan Am bag and got out of there. I

17:01.935 --> 17:14.192
think he had actually burned hair in his effort to 
prevent the scandal of whiskey being found on that

17:01.935 --> 17:14.192
campus. He's later i think the board said now look 
earl when they built the new house uh you've got to

17:14.924 --> 17:39.750
entertain so just forget about this phobia about 
whiskey because when we come over we want it too and

17:14.924 --> 17:39.750
so he he he finally set up a little bar there but he 
sure was careful about who saw it now in the old

17:14.924 --> 17:39.750
house did they lose a lot of their furniture and 
possessions they sure did The students went in and

17:39.983 --> 17:43.827
saved a lot of things. One was a piano that I 
remember. But they really lost a lot of personal

17:46.911 --> 17:50.756
things. They really did. And it was a hardship on 
them. It really was. Now, where did they live after

17:54.139 --> 17:56.102
the fire? On Lee Street. In a two-story White House 
in the first block of Lee Street on the left-hand

17:57.644 --> 18:03.570
side as you go south. And the school just rented 
that for them until they built the other one. He

18:10.088 --> 18:17.901
went to great lengths to get as much of the new and 
built free of charge as he could, and donations

18:10.088 --> 18:17.901
from alumni. And he did a tremendous job on that. He 
wanted it facing east. He did that. And John, I

18:25.353 --> 18:30.862
mean, Connolly. What's his from? Connolly Moving 
and Storage. Donald and Doug. Moved him from Lee

18:35.570 --> 18:40.517
Street to his home at no cost. That was his gift. And 
then a few months later, Peg and I finished our

18:43.120 --> 18:48.187
little home down Pershing Street. And Conley 
Brothers moved us, and I said, OK, what's the bill?

18:55.505 --> 18:57.988
And he said, the same thing that Mr. Rutter got. Oh, 
how nice. How nice. And in those days, $10 was a, I

19:00.130 --> 19:04.796
mean, we had kids out at the kazoo. And that was 
really a generous kind of a thing.

19:11.624 --> 19:23.278
Those are really the things to me that he was 
proudest of, the beginning of a new faculty, the

19:11.624 --> 19:23.278
higher caliber faculty, the financial support 
required to really move the school, the

19:11.624 --> 19:23.278
connections to get big time people like Werner Von 
Braun and the first astronauts here. He took great

19:29.926 --> 19:39.298
pride in those kind of things, associating the 
students with what was great, who was great in

19:29.926 --> 19:39.298
America at that particular time.

19:42.683 --> 19:52.776
There have got to be some memories tucked away in 
your brain of some of the lighter moments and some

19:42.683 --> 19:52.776
of the more serious moments of the Rudder years. 
The funniest thing that ever happened was that

19:53.313 --> 20:13.091
daughter Jane, I believe it was Jane, fell in love 
with a real good-looking old boy that was as poor as

19:53.313 --> 20:13.091
a church mouse, but handsome, who was a student in 
veterinary medicine. And in order to survive, he

20:14.972 --> 20:18.055
had to get a job. He didn't have a car, so it had to be a 
job on campus. and he ended up with the grounds

20:23.232 --> 20:26.236
maintenance crew. Do you know this story? And the 
grounds maintenance crew had a chalkboard, and

20:29.740 --> 20:39.012
they'd say, okay, on Thursday, we're going to be 
trimming the hedges around the Coke building. On

20:39.032 --> 20:42.516
Tuesday, we're going to be at the library doing 
this or that. Well, he looked on there and said,

20:43.377 --> 20:49.785
Thursday, you're going to be working in the 
president's rose garden. And he was going with

20:49.805 --> 20:52.609
Jane and Mr. Rudder, was out of town. And he called 
Jane and he said, sweetie, I'm going to be working

20:56.844 --> 21:03.151
in your Rose Garden Thursday. Where is your daddy 
going to be? And she looked it up and said, he's

21:05.813 --> 21:07.975
going to be out of town. He said, let me have lunch 
with you there at the house. You fix lunch for us.

21:13.781 --> 21:15.763
And she readily agreed. And they came over in an old 
dump truck. And I can still see the foreman wore one

21:18.606 --> 21:24.171
of those old Texaco hats and khakis buttoned up 
here. the 12 o'clock whistle blew. And he said,

21:27.880 --> 21:29.041
come on, boys. We're going back for lunch. And this 
boy threw his hoe down. He says, I think I'll just

21:32.385 --> 21:35.789
have lunch here and walked into the front door. The 
poor old man. The former didn't know whether to shh

21:38.612 --> 21:42.216
or go blind. He didn't know what to do. And the boy 
just walked in. Another thing that was funny that

21:47.863 --> 21:54.951
happened, it sure wasn't funny at the time, with 
his phobia about whiskey on campus. And we had a

21:57.125 --> 21:59.729
deal where I could go to Austin. When I was in 
Austin, he said, go by the Liquor Association. And

22:07.440 --> 22:10.445
they have a building in Austin. And they had a 
standing offer that I could come over there or

22:10.645 --> 22:22.563
someone from Rutter's office and pick up case 
after case of booze and to bring it back for

22:10.645 --> 22:22.563
official purposes. And so I did that several 
times. He would not allow it to be kept at his house,

22:27.162 --> 22:31.427
so I kept it in a closet at my house. And one time, we 
got down to one bottle. It was time for another trip

22:35.452 --> 22:38.115
to Austin. Had one good bottle left, and his rule 
with me was always keep one good bottle. When he

22:42.800 --> 22:53.473
called me, he'd meet me, and I'd give him this 
bottle, and he would go over to Ramada Inn and give

22:42.800 --> 22:53.473
it to Olin E.T., of which they would sit down and 
drink the entire thing. So he calls me one Sunday

22:53.943 --> 22:56.086
afternoon. He said, Edwin, get the bottle ready. 
I'll be over there in about half an hour. Tiger's

22:59.511 --> 23:00.512
here. And I had had a party of my own at the house. And 
we had consumed most of that bottle, knowing full

23:04.758 --> 23:12.609
well it'd be replaced before he'd need it. So here 
was the president of the university coming over to

23:12.629 --> 23:16.655
get his congressman his bottle of whiskey. And I 
was out. So I ran over to Carl Butler's house by car.

23:22.782 --> 23:25.284
I said, Carl, give me the best bottle of bourbon 
you've got. I'll pay you back later. And boy, he saw

23:26.866 --> 23:29.328
the urgency, gave it to me. And as I drove back onto 
Texas Avenue, College Avenue, Mr. Rutter and his

23:30.169 --> 23:38.136
wife passed by, going straight for my house. So I 
came up right behind them. And I came out with a

23:41.419 --> 23:42.720
brown bag. And I said, I'm embarrassed about the 
kind of whiskey that we had for the Congressman. So

23:47.365 --> 23:52.249
I prevailed on one of my friends to give us this 
really top dollar, Paul. Well, how very nice. And I

23:55.174 --> 23:58.199
never did tell him the difference. Let me add an 
anecdote that I heard in Washington, and I cannot

23:58.219 --> 24:04.628
remember from what member of the Texas delegation 
it was. It was in the 60s, and I was up there doing

24:05.970 --> 24:14.202
research on Jefferson Davis, and I went by two or 
three different Texas congressmen's offices.

24:14.222 --> 24:16.064
Oh, it was Jack Brooks. And I told him how helpful 
the Library of Congress had been and so forth. He

24:20.343 --> 24:24.810
knew my A&M connection and that I knew Mr. Rutter 
and so forth. And he said that, one, he had

24:25.552 --> 24:45.945
witnessed part of, and it's heard the rest of it, 
that Mr. Rutter was in Washington and that Teague

24:25.552 --> 24:45.945
was going to, because he was a committee chairman, 
he had a big office, and he was going to cook some

24:25.552 --> 24:45.945
steaks for certain members of the Texas 
delegation. And he had also laid in some alcoholic

24:46.178 --> 24:49.382
refreshment. Mr. Rutter was there. And while 
they're cooking and waiting for the others to

24:51.365 --> 24:56.552
come, they have a few refreshments. And they look, 
and where are all the people? It's late. It's late.

25:02.100 --> 25:13.215
And according to Brooks, when he went to his office 
earlier than usual the next morning, here was the

25:02.100 --> 25:13.215
chairman of the House Veterans Affairs 
Committee. and the president of Texas A&M coming

25:13.448 --> 25:22.560
down the hallway with their arms around each other 
singing, goodbye to Texas, because they had

25:13.448 --> 25:22.560
gotten mixed up on the night. It was the wrong 
night. And so they said they weren't about to

25:24.643 --> 25:27.046
cancel the party. They didn't cancel the party. 
Probably the most emotional

25:30.510 --> 25:38.140
thing that ever happened to me was the day that 
President Kennedy was killed in Dallas, and I was

25:39.352 --> 25:45.521
his assistant. And every administrator in the 
Koch building was either in Dallas or somewhere.

25:55.575 --> 26:03.887
And the lowly assistant to the president was the 
highest-ranking officer in that office that day,

25:55.575 --> 26:03.887
and I don't think that had ever happened before. 
There's always at least a vice president, or they

26:03.947 --> 26:07.232
weren't there. They were all because of 
Kennedy's. So the word flashed that he'd been

26:11.350 --> 26:14.113
shot. And Mr. Rutter was at that Coliseum waiting 
to be there. And of course, the word came. And I ran

26:22.863 --> 26:25.165
over to the MSC. There was no television in that 
building at that time. And watched what was on the

26:33.094 --> 26:37.118
air and started crying. Went back to the Koch 
building, and the first thing I got was a call from

26:37.638 --> 26:47.908
one

26:37.638 --> 26:47.908
of the deans.

26:51.112 --> 26:57.298
And he

26:51.112 --> 26:57.298
was crying, just openly crying on the phone. He 
said, I called to find out what we're supposed to

26:57.318 --> 27:00.481
do. I said, I'll tell you what we're going to do. I'm 
the only one here. And that places me in authority.

27:09.192 --> 27:13.056
I said, we're going to close this damn thing down. 
And I said, I will call all the other deans and the

27:13.076 --> 27:20.063
chief vice presidents all across campus. And I 
said, you just consider this school closed as of

27:20.143 --> 27:24.267
right now. And that's what we did. And probably it 
was the best thing to do. And we, if I'm not

27:28.591 --> 27:31.454
mistaken, we canceled Bonfire. Bonfire, right. 
And almost beat the Longhorns. Yeah. a national

27:34.692 --> 27:37.095
championship year. Let's see. His relationship 
with Mr. Teague. Describe that. Classmates. It

27:45.404 --> 27:48.628
went way back all the way.

27:57.257 --> 28:04.125
Mr. Teague

27:57.257 --> 28:04.125
had a job shoveling manure out at the cattle and 
livestock, I'll just say livestock barns,

28:04.713 --> 28:15.925
as a way to make money. And Rudder was a transfer 
student from Tarleton, but somehow they

28:18.147 --> 28:29.239
immediately became friends, classmates, I mean, 
roommates, I guess. And Rudder got permission

28:37.552 --> 28:50.855
to stake out a cow somewhere close to where the 
tennis courts are and sold the milk,

28:37.552 --> 28:50.855
I think, to the athletic dorm or something like 
that. But they had a great camaraderie going about

28:51.837 --> 28:56.184
which one had the most. Teague claimed that Rudder 
watered down the milk, and Rudder said, would

29:02.932 --> 29:06.295
always come back with, well, you were out there 
shoveling shit. How would you know what I was doing

29:06.315 --> 29:08.277
with the milk? But they were nearly like teenage 
boys growing up together. And of course, they had

29:16.625 --> 29:19.608
the war experience. And Teague was made 
postmaster. Do you remember that? And I remember

29:24.213 --> 29:31.420
one day I was with him, and he was combing his hair. 
And of all things, a little piece of shrapnel had

29:32.648 --> 29:35.771
come through the skin. He got a blast up above him. 
And he had shrapnel under the surface. And he said,

29:42.057 --> 29:44.139
that's one of my damn problems. Every time I comb my 
hair, a piece of steel comes out my comb. This while

29:47.702 --> 29:49.464
he was a congressman? Yeah.

29:54.309 --> 29:55.990
But they couldn't have been closer. And they were 
always together.

30:03.648 --> 30:09.074
Mr. Teague never had any problems politically as 
far as I know, you know, getting reelected. That

30:09.094 --> 30:10.916
just wasn't a problem at all. Judson E. Leupold was 
his campaign manager always, and people used to

30:11.517 --> 30:21.207
say, Tiger, old Lou, he's just kind of a joke. Why 
don't you let him do all this stuff for you? He said,

30:24.791 --> 30:28.896
would you go out to be nice, Texas, and take 
students out there and nail up posters for me.

30:32.506 --> 30:33.266
Would you do that? He does. He does it. And when I 
need money, Lupo gets it for me. So it was a school

30:41.153 --> 30:49.341
experience reinforced by military experience, 
though they weren't together. And then the

30:50.502 --> 30:57.128
relationship between a person in Austin and then 
College Station and a man in Washington. It just

31:00.010 --> 31:02.012
couldn't have been closer. Tiger would argue with 
him. I think they had Tiger's biggest problem ever

31:04.716 --> 31:11.804
with his constituency. Guess what? It was a 
proposed dam on the Navasota River. And part of

31:16.810 --> 31:25.900
that, I have learned since then, was complicated 
by a man named Colter Hoppus, who was the

31:16.810 --> 31:25.900
originator of Camp Creek Lake, and this was going 
to be a country club for the good citizens of Bryan.

31:34.192 --> 31:47.280
And that didn't quite pan out, but right at the end 
of this road, south entrance road, is the Coulter

31:34.192 --> 31:47.280
Office Ranch, which is approximately one-fourth 
of a mile.
