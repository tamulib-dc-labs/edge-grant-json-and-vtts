WEBVTT

00:12.552 --> 00:25.492
So,

00:12.552 --> 00:25.492
after my leave, my terminal leave, I came out to 
Seattle for a while. I went on inactive duty and

00:25.512 --> 00:36.248
then back to Washington, D.C., and I thought we'd 
try it the first few months with Washington. I

00:44.839 --> 00:46.140
wanted to see how I would like it. I'd been there 
many times, but didn't particularly care for the

00:46.160 --> 00:53.967
East Coast. The trout and salmon fishing was not 
very

00:54.027 --> 01:06.538
good in Washington, D.C. and Barnes, so I was 
concerned about getting back to the West Coast.

01:06.957 --> 01:31.986
And so the next year, in September of 47, I resigned 
my position with the Civil Service and came to the

01:06.957 --> 01:31.986
University of Washington as associate professor 
in oceanography.

01:34.362 --> 01:48.842
Dr. Thompson had just gotten back from his tour of 
duty the preceding year at the Chemical Warfare

01:34.362 --> 01:48.842
Service because he was also involved.

01:50.224 --> 02:02.361
And we began to try to put the oceanographic group 
back together again after the war. and the problem

02:04.720 --> 02:11.847
of getting a ship and getting things organized and 
set up. And it meant that for the first year, 47 and

02:12.827 --> 02:34.187
48 and 49, I was at Friday Harbor in the summer 
times, generally teaching a class up there and

02:12.827 --> 02:34.187
down here. in the rest of the year, teaching and 
looking for a ship and getting things organized

02:34.437 --> 02:50.556
for our

02:34.437 --> 02:50.556
post-war expansion. The following year, in 1951,

02:52.118 --> 03:04.292
Dr. Thompson felt that he had put in a long and hard 
enough duty as...

03:19.264 --> 03:24.611
Pardon

03:19.264 --> 03:24.611
me. So, in 1951, we got together and got Dick 
Fleming to come out to head up the new department of

03:35.035 --> 03:40.402
oceanography. So he took over from then a fairly 
rapidly expanding system. Did you already have a

03:51.536 --> 03:53.318
ship by 51? At first we hired

03:54.620 --> 04:02.990
small ships. We always had small a ship to work out 
in Friday Harbor, either a modified fishing boat.

04:12.226 --> 04:23.240
And then we got the school of fisheries here that

04:12.226 --> 04:23.240
built up a small boat. And so we worked out an 
agreement with them so that we could use their

04:24.241 --> 04:31.350
small boat. to cruise and work in the Puget Sound 
waters. And then we got the Brown Bear, a former

04:37.094 --> 04:55.715
Fish and Wildlife Service vessel, to

04:37.094 --> 04:55.715
carry on for our work that we could get out into the 
North Pacific. And the catalyst had gone over to

04:58.651 --> 05:06.160
private hands and first had gone over into 
government service and then private hands and it

04:58.651 --> 05:06.160
was too small for our purposes. So we got the Brown 
Bear. Did you already have some ideas in mind when

05:10.125 --> 05:13.549
you started to outfit this ship? Did you know about 
what you thought you wanted on it? Yes, we knew

05:19.417 --> 05:26.886
pretty well what we what we wanted. I was a little 
bit in double duty at those times, because in 1950,

05:28.646 --> 05:57.278
51, and 52, I was working with the icebreakers 
north of Alaska, from north of Bering Strait to

05:28.646 --> 05:57.278
Banks Island. and up farther north. In fact, 
there's my North Pole certificate up there in

06:02.690 --> 06:06.135
1948.

06:12.204 --> 06:23.721
So this meant that I'd have to leave Friday Harbor 
before the end of the school to take advantage of

06:12.204 --> 06:23.721
the good ice conditions. in August and September, 
which is the best time of the year to work up in that

06:24.038 --> 06:29.684
area. When you worked with an icebreaker then, 
exactly what did you do? Well, we were still

06:34.149 --> 06:50.907
working to get an idea of the currents for one 
thing, the water properties for another, and the

06:51.410 --> 06:56.214
movements of the ice. And this is, of course, 
preceding the days when submarines went under the

06:56.234 --> 07:04.641
ice. How long could you usually anticipate being 
out at a time? How many days? Well, I

07:11.487 --> 07:20.235
would generally leave on three years. all 
sometime in August, early August, and get back

07:21.076 --> 07:30.810
about the latter part of September. And I worked on 
those cruises a great deal with Waldo Lyons. who

07:41.579 --> 07:52.031
was looking out after the particular interests of 
the navigation operations in that area. And I was

07:52.472 --> 08:07.529
more or less looking at some of the needed 
scientific information that we sort of needed to

07:52.472 --> 08:07.529
give a better hand on Arctic operations.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.573
So that worked out for about three years and then I 
would send up some of my people each year after I

08:10.891 --> 08:27.870
stopped going up personally, although I would get 
an occasional brief. trip in.

08:32.805 --> 08:38.130
And I think I probably have more North Pole covers 
than most people.

08:42.294 --> 08:56.187
For philatelists, which I am not, but these are 
quite a prized set of covers that were stamped with

08:42.294 --> 08:56.187
the North Pole.

08:57.027 --> 09:12.670
And so this... And during this time, while we 
built, starting in about 1950, we built a model of

08:57.027 --> 09:12.670
Puget Sound. And we got Professor Ratray from 
Caltech up here to do some of our theoretical work

09:13.852 --> 09:26.410
in hydrodynamics. And so on, and he's our present 
chairman

09:26.660 --> 09:33.388
here. So this was the story up until about the 
mid-50s.

09:46.763 --> 09:54.152
And I continued going up to Friday Harbor, I guess, 
the last year was 1957. But it became quite a rat

09:55.027 --> 10:05.602
race to run back and forth when we were trying to 
operate a ship out of Seattle and teach a class at

09:55.027 --> 10:05.602
Friday Harbor in the summertime.

10:09.788 --> 10:24.409
So we

10:09.788 --> 10:24.409
continued to expand and grow along through the 
60s. And we got a larger ship, the Thomas T.

10:25.402 --> 10:49.435
Thompson, disposed of the Brown Bear that had done 
us much good in the local open sea, and which we

10:25.402 --> 10:49.435
actually got up beyond the Arctic Circle with it. 
How large was it? It couldn't have been— 125 feet.

10:56.297 --> 11:01.765
Or

10:56.297 --> 11:01.765
is it 114? I forget. Too small to be up at the Arctic 
Circle. Well, it's nice in the summertime, but

11:06.172 --> 11:16.789
certainly no icebreaker.

11:18.389 --> 11:40.710
That, that, that continued in the 19, about the 
time we got the Thompson, when Dr. Fleming went

11:18.389 --> 11:40.710
over to Turkey for a year and I sort of chaperoned 
the department for a year in his absence. And then

11:42.732 --> 11:46.776
in 1948,

11:47.583 --> 12:02.376
or 1968,

11:47.583 --> 12:02.376
Dr. Rattray relieved Dr. Fleming as chairman of 
the department, and still is. And I retired as

12:02.396 --> 12:08.442
professor emeritus in 1973. And

12:08.662 --> 12:17.590
I'm still working. I have several questions I'd 
like to ask now. In your first and early work up in

12:21.745 --> 12:35.907
the Arctic,

12:21.745 --> 12:35.907
was it always simply charting what you thought 
would be the current flow and ice flow of the

12:21.745 --> 12:35.907
Arctic?

12:40.073 --> 12:44.720
You mean in the Arctic beyond the Arctic Circle? 
Yeah, right. Well, and the chemical

12:46.358 --> 12:48.443
measurements. We always took our routine 
chemical measurements, the more or less

12:48.463 --> 13:00.133
customary suite of properties in those days. We 
would get dissolved oxygen. the phosphates, the

13:02.778 --> 13:07.625
silicates, and the nitrites. This was the 
carryover from my days in 1933 and 1934 up there,

13:07.645 --> 13:21.707
although in 1934 I just did get beyond the Arctic 
Circle. But the common properties, which are

13:21.727 --> 13:29.258
oftentimes very good indicators, aside from 
the... the other direct physical measurements

13:29.609 --> 13:31.791
you made. We always make the salinity temperature 
measurements from which we get the density and the

13:31.851 --> 13:56.578
dynamic topography, just like we did on the Grand 
Banks, which I'd done a little bit when I was

13:31.851 --> 13:56.578
working on my doctorate in 1933

13:31.851 --> 13:56.578
and 1934. We were interested in

13:57.217 --> 14:25.063
movements, not only of the ice pack up there, but we 
were interested in the movements of some of the

13:57.217 --> 14:25.063
chunks that broke off the glacier north of 
Ellesmere Island and was drifting around the

13:57.217 --> 14:25.063
Arctic, the T. ones, T2s, T3s, the ones that Joe 
Fletcher, Colonel Fletcher, had sort of

14:25.465 --> 14:34.119
pioneered on. And we were interested in the flows 
there. We were interested in the, very much

14:40.008 --> 14:47.600
interested, of course, in the bathymetry.

14:48.521 --> 14:53.329
And we actually found the Chukchi rice. out 
northwest of Barrow and charted it. And it almost

15:01.678 --> 15:23.890
broke my heart when the schedule was such that we 
couldn't work it out in full detail during the year

15:01.678 --> 15:23.890
when we had the ice the farthest north and probably 
one of the best years ever to work it out.

15:29.489 --> 15:31.631
Why did you decide to come back to the University of 
Washington? It was home? Well, it was home. It gave

15:36.677 --> 15:38.740
me a chance to get out and see. And then I also, as I 
say, like to get out with the fly for steelhead and

15:39.961 --> 15:58.382
salmon and trout.

15:58.649 --> 16:00.752
it's just a nice place to live. And then my wife was a 
native of Seattle, and so there were two minds bent

16:00.832 --> 16:12.588
towards the same end of getting back here.

16:15.852 --> 16:22.902
The two other places I liked really best was either 
Newfoundland or British Columbia.

16:25.514 --> 16:28.317
Well, it's pretty hard to operate Scripps or Woods 
Hole, either one of those.

16:35.603 --> 16:42.250
It almost seems as if, from hearing your story, 
that you almost drift into oceanography. Well,

16:42.590 --> 16:48.996
you can see the situation.

16:51.759 --> 16:55.302
Oceanography is made up of contributing 
disciplines. And it was my early feeling that if

16:58.565 --> 17:19.668
you had chemistry and physics,

16:58.565 --> 17:19.668
you could handle a lot of what went on, whether you 
were dealing with the environment, whether

16:58.565 --> 17:19.668
you're dealing with an engineering problem of a 
shore. I was a research engineer at Battelle

17:19.728 --> 17:24.293
Memorial Institute, worked on combustion. and 
gasification and corrosion and so on. And then in

17:34.015 --> 17:41.763
partnership with some other students, I had my own 
chemical lab running on spray residues. And so I

17:42.683 --> 17:46.467
think I was fortunate in some ways. There was never 
a time in my life that I didn't have two or three jobs

17:46.527 --> 17:53.875
that I could have stepped into ahead of me. I think 
another

17:54.293 --> 18:07.872
phase of it might have been to have gone more into 
the organic chemical side. Then you might have

18:08.272 --> 18:16.023
ended up as an MD or something like that in some 
other area. But if you had a strong base, you then

18:22.846 --> 18:43.217
whatever came up and it suited your fancy why you 
could sort of turn to it and I did like the sea life

18:22.846 --> 18:43.217
going out to sea and the old trips didn't have the 
modern communications that we do now where you can

18:43.602 --> 18:52.214
send a crew out to join the ship in the Indian Ocean 
and bring them back in a few weeks. But there, as I

18:52.975 --> 18:58.182
mentioned, my trip in 1933 was five months.

19:01.025 --> 19:11.820
And during the time when I was officially signed at 
Woods Hole,

19:01.025 --> 19:11.820
during that period, I don't think that I was at 
Woods Hole more than

19:12.374 --> 19:25.894
five, maybe six months in the years from 1940 to 
1946.

19:32.103 --> 19:42.178
But the work is very much the same in oceanography, 
whether you're working in the Atlantic or the

19:32.103 --> 19:42.178
Pacific or the Arctic. For the tropics, you have 
similar problems. The same principles apply, but

19:48.228 --> 19:54.076
to a different degree. That's right. I think you'd 
be a little colder than one might like it. Yes. I

20:00.666 --> 20:05.693
noticed the last few years I was in the Arctic why it 
didn't seem quite as warm as it had in my youth. How

20:08.077 --> 20:12.082
many people usually staffed this ship in terms of 
oceanographers in the early ships you went on? Did

20:12.243 --> 20:13.144
you have to take... Two oceanographers? Three 
oceanographers? Well, in a five-month cruise, I

20:15.751 --> 20:20.598
was the only oceanographer. And I had to set up my 
own stuff on the ship. And generally, I was

20:26.506 --> 20:32.494
assigned ship personnel that I could teach to run 
some of the routine analysis. You'd get a

20:32.534 --> 20:34.677
pharmacist made or something like that. But I 
would put on and take off all the water bottles,

20:35.318 --> 20:41.446
read all the thermometers. Hmm. And this became a 
little bit hairy when the stations were coming up

20:42.554 --> 20:52.205
at three or four hours of bark. And

20:52.225 --> 21:07.282
I could always catch a few winks between stations 
in the middle of the night. But in those days, with

21:07.943 --> 21:11.447
some of our materials

21:13.722 --> 21:28.305
The way we ran some of our chemical 
determinations, the color metric using the old

21:13.722 --> 21:28.305
fashioned Nessler tools before the modern 
optical devices,

21:13.722 --> 21:28.305
you found that you had During the night you would 
accumulate enough samples that had to be run

21:28.690 --> 21:34.558
promptly as soon as it was light enough to see.

21:37.543 --> 21:48.598
So the full daylight hours, even in the northern 
latitudes, were pretty well saturated with

21:37.543 --> 21:48.598
either taking stations or running samples. And 
would you just train a member of the crew to help

21:49.139 --> 21:51.523
you? Is that the way you approached it? That's the 
way I approached it. And that was both on the Navy

21:55.133 --> 22:00.119
and with the Coast Guard. And when did you analyze 
all your data? Did you do that when you got back? Had

22:04.564 --> 22:06.747
to do that when we got back. But the point in the 
field was to ensure that we got the information

22:08.569 --> 22:21.124
that we wanted, the quick checks to know that that 
the bottles had worked, that we didn't have any

22:21.492 --> 22:27.962
leaks or mishaps on it. And so this was part of the 
problem. And this was true, I think, with many of

22:33.631 --> 22:40.141
the early oceanographers.

22:41.182 --> 22:48.073
You really had to be a one-man scientist.

22:49.184 --> 22:57.997
One of your contemporaries has complained that 
what's wrong, he says, with modern oceanography

22:49.184 --> 22:57.997
is you don't get your feet wet any longer, meaning 
not enough oceanographers go to sea. Do you think

22:58.538 --> 23:01.061
it's essential to go to sea to be an oceanographer? 
Well, let's put it this way. There's no one that can

23:06.269 --> 23:18.246
really appreciate the problems of the oceans to 
their full extent unless he goes out and sees the

23:19.627 --> 23:30.202
environment firsthand. That is, he knows then 
some of the limitations here. And it's true that

23:35.829 --> 23:42.799
many of the theory and so on can be done ashore. But 
given the same capabilities, a person that has

23:43.133 --> 24:10.913
experience firsthand what goes on in nature, I 
think, is better equipped to handle some of the

23:43.133 --> 24:10.913
problems than someone that looks at one 
particular aspect,

23:43.133 --> 24:10.913
say, on the theoretical side, for example, 
without having this experience. He knows what

24:11.332 --> 24:27.251
then can be done to make the field measurements 
better, what the limitations are, and it makes for

24:11.332 --> 24:27.251
a better-rounded scientist.

24:30.074 --> 24:36.522
What would you consider the most amazing 
innovation, if you had to name just one, which has

24:30.074 --> 24:36.522
taken place in oceanography over the last 40 
years? Technically, I mean.

24:43.478 --> 25:04.258
Well, it's hard to separate that

24:43.478 --> 25:04.258
which takes place in oceanography from that which 
takes place in science as a whole, because we must

24:43.478 --> 25:04.258
borrow from the different contributing 
disciplines of science. A lot of the things that we

25:06.000 --> 25:13.367
have borrowed have not been essentially those of 
themselves have put us far ahead in new channels in

25:13.803 --> 25:31.005
oceanography, but they've enabled us to carry out 
much more precise measurements on a continuing

25:13.803 --> 25:31.005
base that we were otherwise not able to do. We've 
seen tremendous developments in means for

25:31.025 --> 25:38.815
measuring ocean currents. tremendous 
developments in looking at the sea from the air and

25:38.997 --> 25:52.851
being able to get an overall view that was not 
possible in the early days. We have many new

25:52.951 --> 26:05.224
chemical techniques that are higher precision, 
so always extending

26:06.183 --> 26:26.440
to the lower limits of detection and accuracy and 
measurements for a number of different compounds

26:06.183 --> 26:26.440
and

26:06.183 --> 26:26.440
different elements

26:06.183 --> 26:26.440
that we could not do in the early days. And

26:27.861 --> 26:36.088
with this ability, then you can make a much more 
illuminating analysis.

26:44.187 --> 27:06.447
If you look at what is different now in 
oceanography than it was in the early days, and if

26:44.187 --> 27:06.447
you go through and read the oceans that Svardrop 
masterminded, you will see that there's very few

26:44.187 --> 27:06.447
things in that framework that have changed in the 
gross picture. There's been a lot that has been

27:15.361 --> 27:19.444
picked up in the detail. And we're always going 
more on that way. And we have to do so.

27:29.234 --> 27:35.640
So there's a combination of things.

27:37.207 --> 27:51.441
of detecting from a distance, and making 
measurements from a distance, whether they be

27:37.207 --> 27:51.441
from air, or through underwater sound, or what 
have you. These have all advanced greatly. I might

27:57.407 --> 28:00.149
tell you a little story, if I might. Yes, well, 
meet. It happened when we were under radio silence

28:08.645 --> 28:38.483
that one of my the ships in which we were conducting 
some iceberg detection made for measurements by

28:08.645 --> 28:38.483
radar on the Grand Banks was situated where we had 
four bergs and in the typical dense fog at the Grand

28:39.138 --> 28:53.134
Banks, one of the coastal steamers there that had 
never heard of radar.

28:55.076 --> 28:59.081
It was steaming out of St. John's and going on a 
certain course. And it observed the skipper of the

29:00.322 --> 29:08.672
ship I had doing the studies. saw that it was 
running right into, dead ahead into an iceberg and

29:10.542 --> 29:31.538
he didn't want the ship to have a collision and so he 
opened up on an emergency signal and said unknown

29:10.542 --> 29:31.538
ship going on such and such a course at such and such 
a speed, you are headed directly for a large

29:31.788 --> 29:40.118
iceberg. Suggest you change course."

29:47.688 --> 29:50.111
And no response, of course.

29:55.057 --> 29:57.660
He got a pretty- pretty close to this berg. We 
opened up again and told him that the berg was now

30:00.685 --> 30:13.221
such and such a distance, and he was right on course 
for it to suggest you change course to such and

30:00.685 --> 30:13.221
such. Well, he still didn't believe it until he saw 
it. And he turned around and set another course.

30:22.894 --> 30:27.580
And being in the middle of a square of about four 
bergs, why he chose another course that took him

30:27.998 --> 30:32.063
towards another iceberg. And so we let him go along 
for a while. And then finally, we opened up and told

30:36.708 --> 30:42.895
him he was heading for a second iceberg and 
suggested that he change course. And he was still

30:44.557 --> 30:50.244
bullheaded, would not change course. And believe 
it or not, he tried a third.

30:57.209 --> 31:13.409
And we finally told him when he got close to it, he 
says, that if you will please change course to such

30:57.209 --> 31:13.409
and such a direction and continue for a certain 
distance, why you will be clear of all birds and can

30:57.209 --> 31:13.409
proceed. And he did. But I've often wondered what 
that fellow... Thought you had eyes?
