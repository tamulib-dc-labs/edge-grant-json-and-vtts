WEBVTT

00:05.667 --> 00:11.814
His

00:05.667 --> 00:11.814
age might have been a factor. His health might have 
been a factor. These leaders in the communist bloc

00:13.415 --> 00:31.995
tend to be elderly men who have survived in very 
rough political failures, and they tend to be not

00:13.415 --> 00:31.995
robust in their health. He also, Hillbrook, was 
also a very hardline communist, a very

00:34.068 --> 00:48.174
unpresentable in a way, someone that people in the 
West didn't like. And it may have been just decided

00:48.875 --> 00:55.688
that as a response of the time that it was a good

01:02.063 --> 01:08.132
somebody else come on, but I don't remember that it 
was a dispute over an issue or anything like that.

01:10.435 --> 01:15.603
Do you think the Russians used Berlin as an 
incentive for the U.S. to get involved in SALT? No,

01:16.264 --> 01:17.225
I don't think so. I think Berlin, as an issue, stood 
on its own merits, had to do with their long-term

01:18.207 --> 01:31.446
stabilization of of Eastern Europe and so forth. 
To some extent, you might say, these things are all

01:36.678 --> 01:44.288
interrelated, but I just don't

02:04.838 --> 02:16.259
I'm not sure it would have anything directly

02:04.838 --> 02:16.259
involved as impact. I think it would indicate at 
the highest strategic level to the Soviets that

02:16.279 --> 02:26.357
events were unfolding

02:36.209 --> 02:50.504
And that any sign of a ruckus or coming together of 
the Chinese and the Americans and so forth was not a

02:36.209 --> 02:50.504
good thing for the Soviets. So they would have not 
liked it and so forth. But what they were doing in

02:54.669 --> 03:03.178
Europe, particularly with reference to Berlin, 
was moving in the right direction anyway.

03:34.462 --> 03:36.265
made a big cooptie-doo out of this. They thought 
this was something great. Whether it was wise or

03:39.850 --> 03:44.658
not, it's hard to say. Because you see, you have a 
lot of Soviet presence anyway, as far as security

03:44.718 --> 03:51.788
is concerned. You have to assume that they've got 
millions, not millions, but lots of spies there, a

03:52.349 --> 03:58.318
lot of agents there. They come in there.

04:08.397 --> 04:20.836
So it appeared to be necessary or something that 
was going to make the agreement possible. And it

04:20.856 --> 04:23.440
could have been a lot worse than that, I think. We 
could have probably given up a lot more than that. I

04:25.483 --> 04:28.328
don't know what they've gotten out of it. I don't 
know what they get out of that.

04:35.699 --> 04:36.801
What are the secret protocols?

04:52.087 --> 05:14.668
the russians that that group there was neo-nazis 
or something oh yeah okay yeah okay well these are

04:52.087 --> 05:14.668
some crazy people over there crazy political 
agitators uh and i can't remember what they were

04:52.087 --> 05:14.668
doing but uh it it would have been all right see we 
have

05:24.132 --> 05:38.913
that we would try to restrict the travel of these 
bad people, sort of like the Ku Klux Klan, but

05:24.132 --> 05:38.913
politically, you know, neo-Nazis. I can't 
remember that, but again, it would have been quite

05:38.933 --> 05:44.301
a

06:43.495 --> 07:02.314
I think that it was whether all the governments 
agreed that they were prepared to act to implement

06:43.495 --> 07:02.314
the concept that they taught in a real way, in a 
practical way. We all had problems. Assuringly,

07:05.257 --> 07:10.262
we had problems with Berlin.

07:23.033 --> 07:25.576
issue arose was valuable to us. Also, as I said, we 
had been pursuing the other policy that Germany

07:26.657 --> 07:45.276
was only one Germany, Germany was undivided, 
etc., that East Germany was not a real government,

07:26.657 --> 07:45.276
and so forth. And we really hadn't gotten very far 
with it. Both sides were stonewalling. And I think

07:59.062 --> 08:02.608
and come up with an agreement that did in effect

09:13.447 --> 09:31.038
was so much greater than you got from an individual 
spy that they felt it was

09:13.447 --> 09:31.038
important to us to have our man back. They had not, 
Abel had not spoken, he had not

09:45.796 --> 09:50.518
was an important agent, very important. And he was 
cooperating as a

10:47.795 --> 10:53.929
that if he had revealed them to the Soviets, 
something would have been compromised. Somebody

10:53.949 --> 11:00.323
would have been harmed, or certain installations 
would have been compromised. So they were

11:00.343 --> 11:04.993
confident at that time

11:18.710 --> 11:21.710
and do something he would not normally. So there 
are a lot of factors involved,

12:01.606 --> 12:06.882
not accept or they were tried out on us. Now this 
young man Mackinnon was an army captain and he did

12:06.902 --> 12:16.290
work for either the counter intelligence

12:39.372 --> 12:40.954
and power. Power was what we really wanted. But we 
thought we could, we thought we had the Soviets

12:42.956 --> 12:50.065
where they would give us more than one. We thought 
we could get more than power. We thought they

12:53.048 --> 12:56.693
wanted them badly enough. So that's the way we 
maneuvered. What happened to Mackinac? They

12:59.917 --> 13:01.038
eventually got him out. Oh, did they? Yeah. I can't 
remember the circumstances

13:04.122 --> 13:08.687
whether they

14:05.890 --> 14:07.804
So we did that. All right.
