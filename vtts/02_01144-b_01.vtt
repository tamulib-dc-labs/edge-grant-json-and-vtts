00:08.047 --> 00:15.375
OK, this is Ron Shorn in Boulder, Colorado, 
interviewing Rita F. Beebe on October 21, 1993.

00:16.035 --> 00:21.101
Rita, for the record, could you give your full 
name?

00:23.924 --> 00:25.666
Rita Faye Jenkins Beebe. And when and where were 
you born? In Pritchett, Colorado, October 10,

00:29.349 --> 00:34.395
1936. How do you spell Pritchett? 
P-R-I-T-C-H-E-T-T, but I don't believe it exists

00:36.852 --> 00:41.178
anymore. Where did you get interested in 
astronomy at the beginning?

00:48.709 --> 00:50.732
I had a strange childhood. I grew up near Boulder, 
Colorado. My father was 54 years old when I was

00:55.138 --> 00:59.164
born. He was a cowpuncher in his younger days and 
had settled into ranching and farming by the time I

01:00.055 --> 01:06.962
came along. As a cowpuncher, he spent a 
considerable number of winters with remittance

01:08.183 --> 01:17.813
men in line shacks. And these people were people 
who were very well-schooled dropouts from

01:19.115 --> 01:27.543
Eastern culture in those days. My father's 
interest having had only a third-grade

01:30.076 --> 01:40.612
education, was in nature, and the knowledge he had 
accumulated was that of a naturalist in the

01:30.076 --> 01:40.612
old-fashioned sense. So I grew up believing 
everybody knew about constellations and

01:41.393 --> 01:48.984
everybody asked questions about stars. I had 
mechanical tendencies and was frequently

01:50.266 --> 01:58.699
accused of stealing my father's tools when he lost 
them and that sort of thing and having no brothers

01:50.266 --> 01:58.699
to compete with. I was allowed to develop my 
interests. I developed sort of a two-pronged

02:03.150 --> 02:14.764
interest in the fact that I also wanted to be an 
artist, and I actually spent the first two years of

02:03.150 --> 02:14.764
my college days majoring in art before I turned 
back to the physical sciences. Where did you go to

02:15.425 --> 02:17.027
undergraduate school? I went to art school at 
Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas, and the

02:18.008 --> 02:27.420
Kansas City Art Institute, and then returned to 
Colorado University Why did you go to Kansas?

02:30.245 --> 02:30.725
Fellowships. All right, so then you went back 
after you left art school and went to? Colorado

02:36.691 --> 02:38.112
University. Okay, in Boulder. Yes. And what did 
you major in there? Chemistry. Chemistry. Why

02:42.777 --> 02:44.418
chemistry? Because at that time I was going to be a 
veterinarian, and I couldn't put the financial

02:44.439 --> 02:50.444
package together for that. So then I moved into 
teaching junior high school. Junior high school.

02:57.016 --> 03:06.365
We went into an extensive curriculum 
development, and I moved into teaching earth

02:57.016 --> 03:06.365
science, and after three years of that, then I came 
back to graduate school. Okay, when did you get

03:06.905 --> 03:09.748
your bachelor's degree? Fifty-nine. Okay, and 
when did you enter graduate school? In 62, I guess?

03:14.712 --> 03:15.713
Yeah. Where did you go to grad school? Indiana 
University. Why did you pick Indiana? Previous to

03:19.757 --> 03:25.622
Indiana University, I went back to the University 
of Idaho for two years to upgrade my physics and

03:19.757 --> 03:25.622
mathematics. and then did a survey of graduate 
schools. And I got married in 59. So that parallel

03:34.341 --> 03:38.667
to my development, my husband was doing the same 
thing. So we were going to enter graduate school

03:38.727 --> 03:40.549
together. And we picked Indiana because they gave 
us a double financial package that we needed. How

03:46.878 --> 03:50.182
long did you stay at Indiana as a grad student? When 
did you get out? 69. 69. What was your doctoral

03:52.786 --> 03:55.710
dissertation and who was your The work was on R. 
Cygnus, a red giant star with anomalous heavy

03:56.652 --> 04:07.209
metal abundance. My thesis advisor was Benjamin 
Franklin Peary.

04:14.641 --> 04:17.406
Okay, so you got your Ph.D. in when? October of 69. 
Okay, I covered that. So where did you go after

04:22.943 --> 04:25.366
that? When did your husband get his degree? He got 
his in September of 69. He got a position at New

04:32.276 --> 04:38.045
Mexico State University as an assistant 
professor in astronomy. I had worked as a graduate

04:39.627 --> 04:46.757
student at Los Alamos, and at that time there were 
not two jobs available. But I was well enough

04:47.446 --> 04:53.395
established at Los Alamos that I could continue to 
consult part-time. And we were working on

04:53.655 --> 04:59.323
molecular opacities calculations. And that was 
quite compatible. The New Mexico State

05:01.827 --> 05:08.977
University gave me office space and computer 
access free of charge. So it was quite a

05:09.899 --> 05:14.205
comfortable arrangement. Okay. And what were you 
working on there? I was interacting with the Los

05:16.690 --> 05:21.575
Alamos group working on opacities. Then in 
January of that year, I began to work with Brad

05:22.076 --> 05:25.900
Smith. OK. How did that come about? Elmer Reese had 
developed quite a few measurements of drift rates

05:30.145 --> 05:38.894
of clouds in the atmosphere of Jupiter. And he had 
lost his collaborator, Gordon Solberg, to

05:45.175 --> 05:49.280
controversial political issues and needed some 
assistance. So I started working just part time on

05:49.360 --> 06:00.334
the Los Alamos situation and part time for Brad 
Smith to help Elmer Reese with that

05:49.360 --> 06:00.334
interpretation.

06:03.057 --> 06:07.322
OK. How long did that happen? I mean, how long did 
you stay in that position doing that kind of work?

06:11.548 --> 06:13.410
After about a year. We wrote new proposals, and I 
became fully funded in the study of Jupiter's

06:13.846 --> 06:25.301
atmosphere and worked as a research associate 
until 1974.

06:27.564 --> 06:30.108
And what did you do research on until 1974? Jupiter 
and Venus ground-based data. What kind of data?

06:37.517 --> 06:39.740
Photographic. And what happened in 1974? 1974, 
Brad Smith left New Mexico State, moved to the

06:42.888 --> 06:57.792
University of Arizona, and I was selected to 
replace him as a tender track assistant professor

06:42.888 --> 06:57.792
of astronomy. And what's happened to your career 
since then? We continued to study Jupiter, and in

07:01.959 --> 07:09.351
1977, I joined the Voyager team to assist in the 
targeting of the imaging and continue to work on

07:10.192 --> 07:16.318
that project. Since Voyager wound down, what have 
your interests been? I moved over to Hubble Space

07:20.662 --> 07:25.747
Telescope. I've been principal investigator on 
teams that are utilizing the WIFPIC planetary

07:36.584 --> 07:59.892
camera mode and the faint object spectrograph to 
do correlative studies of changes in wind fields

07:36.584 --> 07:59.892
cloud wave formation and spectroscopic data when 
you first got into planetary astronomy did you

07:36.584 --> 07:59.892
feel that real quote unquote astronomers 
considered its second rate

08:03.314 --> 08:07.720
I have been known to say that I haven't experienced 
sexual discrimination. I've experienced racial

08:07.780 --> 08:10.343
discrimination. Yes, there has been a general 
tendency to do that. I consider it a lack of ego on

08:17.012 --> 08:21.077
their part. I think they feel grossly challenged 
because when we attempt to do our work, we have

08:21.158 --> 08:29.669
higher spatial resolution. We have more 
information. Our physical interpretations are

08:33.402 --> 08:39.689
frequently more sophisticated than theirs. Do 
you think planetary astronomy is a little more

08:39.929 --> 08:45.215
respected now than it was when you first got into 
the game? Yes, I think so.

08:50.321 --> 08:54.265
What was planetary astronomy like when you first 
got into it? I mean, size, attitudes, the kind of

08:54.366 --> 09:00.152
people that were in it as compared to now?

09:05.583 --> 09:17.737
Actually, by the time I really started 
participating in activities outside of New

09:05.583 --> 09:17.737
Mexico State, there was a fair amount of 
excitement about it.

09:20.621 --> 09:30.072
I remember the second Division of Planetary 
Sciences meeting was in Tallahassee.

09:33.410 --> 09:35.952
I found that meeting extremely exciting. I found 
another thing about it rather strange in the sense

09:36.973 --> 09:45.580
that I encountered strange discrimination. I was 
not allowed to buy my own drinks in that state at

09:45.600 --> 09:56.009
that time as a female, although I was at that point 
in time becoming recognized as a working

09:45.600 --> 09:56.009
scientist. Culture hadn't caught up with it yet, 
definitely. What's the best piece of work you've

10:01.373 --> 10:03.315
done?

10:07.193 --> 10:18.270
The

10:07.193 --> 10:18.270
coordination, the targeting, and the 
interpretation of Voyager 1 Jupiter encounter.

10:19.932 --> 10:29.286
The really satisfying thing about that encounter 
was, yes, we did know a lot about these clouds, and

10:19.932 --> 10:29.286
yes, we did know how to find them. And much of the 
work that we had done before that, that people felt

10:29.570 --> 10:37.660
might be over-interpreting the limited 
ground-based resolution, then became accepted.

10:38.361 --> 10:47.633
So that in retrospect, we could go backward and put 
even more physical constraints on the atmosphere

10:38.361 --> 10:47.633
than the Voyager data itself allows. Did anything 
about the Voyager information about Jupiter

10:48.715 --> 10:55.864
surprise you?

11:04.400 --> 11:13.659
I hadn't done a lot of consideration about the 
magnetic field or the surface conditions of the

11:04.400 --> 11:13.659
satellites before we arrived. Those were 
surprising to me, and part of it was that I hadn't

11:14.200 --> 11:24.602
pushed as hard as I probably should have in those 
areas.

11:25.105 --> 11:29.112
the atmospheric results, I would say satisfied 
me. That was wonderful to see that much of what we

11:30.514 --> 11:37.787
thought was true really was and to just gain higher 
and higher resolution. Voyager 1 was wonderful

11:38.569 --> 11:49.628
because we had almost 90 days of that trip in the 
sense that every day I went in I was seeing a little

11:38.569 --> 11:49.628
higher resolution, a little more of the 
understanding. So it really was a wonderful

11:52.241 --> 11:53.964
thing. I'll never live through another trip like 
that. Have you had any dead ends or fiascos or

11:56.590 --> 12:03.544
things that you wish you wouldn't have gotten 
involved with? I wish I had the time back. that I

12:06.702 --> 12:12.891
have spent trying to figure out what triggers 
disturbances in Jupiter's atmosphere. I've

12:12.971 --> 12:21.022
looked at almost every combination of 
satellites, tides, all sorts of things, and every

12:12.971 --> 12:21.022
one of them is just pulled up as a dead end. If I had 
that time back, I'd probably do some very nice

12:21.122 --> 12:27.090
stuff with it. Where was your first encounter with 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration?

12:31.998 --> 12:36.702
When did they first give you money or put you on a 
board or something? 74. And that was? That was a

12:38.283 --> 12:42.347
grant.

12:42.367 --> 12:42.747
OK. All right. And you've had frequent contact 
with NASA since then. Quite so. How do you think

12:48.692 --> 12:55.217
they handle the management of planetary science 
in general? My feeling is that the people who have

12:55.277 --> 13:01.903
been managing my contracts are excellent. It's a 
structure above that. And the

13:06.181 --> 13:12.547
financial structures have become very 
complicated. Gerard de Bacallure was very strong

13:13.648 --> 13:29.444
in saying that he was really annoyed at the fact 
that NASA would get some pretty pictures out of a

13:13.648 --> 13:29.444
probe and then not support the follow-on 
research, just cut things off. Did you find that

13:30.125 --> 13:31.266
was true? I have aggressively worked to keep M.O. 
and D.A. financed over the years. And yes, it's a

13:42.686 --> 13:46.129
constant problem. And it's a real problem simply 
because it is the one thing that can be delayed. So

13:52.976 --> 13:59.582
that it's sitting there always vulnerable for any 
sort of a taxation or a budget cut It's the one

14:00.170 --> 14:04.254
that's sticking out in the wind ready to be clipped 
off. And that's not just NASA. That happens

14:08.777 --> 14:13.482
everywhere, in business and everywhere. You can 
always delay the fine analysis of the project so

14:13.502 --> 14:21.849
that it's just an ongoing problem. And people who 
are involved in it will continually have to fight.

14:28.475 --> 14:28.995
Where do you think planetary astronomy today 
would be if it wasn't for the money that NASA put

14:29.650 --> 14:39.183
into it in the last 30 years?

14:39.203 --> 14:42.929
Well, I suppose it would still be back in the realm 
of astrology, quite frankly. Because there

14:44.731 --> 14:50.780
really was a huge resistance to letting it grow 
academically. And that came not only from the

14:50.960 --> 14:56.147
classical astronomers, but it also came from the 
classical physicists. because it was their

14:56.752 --> 15:00.418
territory that would be encroached in academia. 
And without NASA, this area would have been

15:01.099 --> 15:06.788
expected to exist in academia. There were several 
big funding crunches in ASA history. One was in 73,

15:12.497 --> 15:16.744
one was in 81, and it looks like we're getting 
another one now. And things have been tight for a

15:18.126 --> 15:21.011
number of years. When you get an intelligent 
student They're intelligent students who say,

15:24.882 --> 15:29.827
gee, I want to go into grad school and be a planetary 
astronomer. What do you tell them now? Well, I have

15:35.633 --> 15:48.626
a discussion with them about the potential, but my 
own attitude, which I convey to them, is that if

15:35.633 --> 15:48.626
they are good enough, they will probably be able to 
survive in it. And quite frankly, if they wanted to

15:49.727 --> 15:54.332
become an architect or any of the other applied 
physical sciences where your real survival is

15:55.038 --> 16:03.969
your own creativity, they'll have the same kind of 
tough time. Now, if they're second rate, I will do

16:03.989 --> 16:13.280
my best to encourage them to decide that they 
really would rather do something else. There's

16:13.740 --> 16:21.990
been some talk lately of turning NASA into the 
National Aeronautics Administration and giving

16:22.493 --> 16:25.978
space research to the Air Force, who already does a 
lot. And of course, before there was an NSA, the Air

16:27.059 --> 16:38.274
Force poured a lot of money into planetary 
astronomy and related topics.

16:38.494 --> 16:41.238
If that happened, would you mind working for the 
Air Force? No.

16:46.665 --> 16:49.108
Don't forget, I've already worked for Los Alamos. 
I like the idea that there are a few intelligent

16:49.949 --> 16:58.940
people working for the agencies who develop our 
ability to go to war. I don't want that left to

16:59.381 --> 17:03.506
people who are warriors by nature.

17:06.250 --> 17:17.003
We're at the Division for Planetary Sciences of 
the American Astronomical Society meeting, and

17:06.250 --> 17:17.003
25 years ago, 26 years ago, there was no special 
organization for planetary astronomy. And in

17:21.186 --> 17:24.290
fact, there was no special journal for planetary 
astronomy. And now there's Icarus and also the

17:24.310 --> 17:29.939
Journal for Geophysical Research-Planet. Do you 
think that this specialization has been good,

17:29.999 --> 17:38.170
bad, indifferent, inevitable? What's your 
opinion? I think the specialization has been

17:40.033 --> 17:42.957
good. I think the fact that it's been recognized as 
an area that should have been pursued and

17:44.118 --> 17:55.355
developed has changed the basic attitude of 
ordinary people. When you walk into an elementary

17:55.375 --> 18:07.493
classroom or a group of freshman students, their 
concept of their surroundings has been grossly

17:55.375 --> 18:07.493
modified by the space program. and it's been 
modified in a constructive way in the sense that

18:08.468 --> 18:17.841
they have been able to see more than one planet. 
They have seen things that are as spectacular as

18:18.582 --> 18:37.108
science fiction can deliver to them, and they have 
been introduced to the concept of cause and effect

18:18.582 --> 18:37.108
in a very graphical way that has led them not only to 
know that this sort of logic exists but to expect it

18:38.185 --> 19:06.690
to expect there to be an explanation of the 
spectacular since you've done both you're an

18:38.185 --> 19:06.690
appropriate person to ask do you ever get annoyed 
when some popular book or tv show claims that

18:38.185 --> 19:06.690
spacecraft discovered everything we know about 
the solar

18:38.185 --> 19:06.690
system it doesn't bother me that much Because 
quite honestly, spacecraft

19:07.362 --> 19:19.737
has brought it to the attention of the public. I 
certainly attempt to correct that over time. Do

19:24.363 --> 19:27.867
you think that planetary astronomy is a part of 
astronomy? Definitely. There's one other thing I

19:30.230 --> 19:33.354
don't know. Astronomy is a part of NASA. The 
traditional astronomy is by a very large part now

19:36.337 --> 19:43.186
funded by NASA. The breakdown between NSF and NASA 
is shocking to me. I mean, the entire field of

19:50.997 --> 19:56.745
astronomy is now dependent for most of its support 
from NASA. This came with the development of the

19:57.166 --> 20:02.513
great observatory projects and that sort of 
thing. Like the Hubble Space Telescope. The shift

20:03.793 --> 20:05.015
is huge. NSF is supporting very little of the whole 
astronomical academic community at this point.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.454
Do you think that's good or bad? I think it's bad. I 
think we've slid into a situation. Any time you

20:20.222 --> 20:26.914
have federal funding for projects that are 
pushing technology, the number of people in the

20:27.620 --> 20:35.591
field will expand to the limit that those projects 
can accept. And we've had this major expansion in

20:36.613 --> 20:39.857
all of the areas. And it can't continue to expand. 
The fact that we're suffering a budget crunch is

20:43.803 --> 20:51.874
caused by many different aspects. And one is 25 
years of expansion of these fields. Let me ask you,

20:57.151 --> 21:04.097
how old do you consider planetary astronomy to be? 
Because there's two schools of thought. One says

21:07.000 --> 21:12.685
it didn't really begin until Galileo looked at the 
sky with a telescope. And others would say, well,

21:13.626 --> 21:23.394
it started back when the first Swiss lake dweller 
looked at the sky and saw that Venus was this bright

21:13.626 --> 21:23.394
thing in the sky after sunset. What's your 
opinion? Actually, I think Planetary science, as

21:26.885 --> 21:33.616
such, really started in the 50s. Before that, it 
was a part of our natural science lore. And in the

21:43.531 --> 21:53.787
1950s, people began to understand spectroscopy 
enough to realize that they could do some very

21:43.531 --> 21:53.787
significant remote sensing. They began to look 
for general physical explanations. They began to

21:59.156 --> 22:01.459
do detailed studies. A classical one is Kuiper's 
study of trying to understand the red spot. A

22:06.807 --> 22:18.383
beautiful study in the sense that, again, here was 
the real realization that we could expand

22:06.807 --> 22:18.383
ourselves, stretch ourselves, and really push 
the concept of cause and effect.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.149
To me, that was the point that the field that we call 
planetary science, where we're really relating

22:23.669 --> 22:35.779
other planets to the Earth instead of saying these 
are wonderful things with some mystic properties

22:23.669 --> 22:35.779
associated with them. We're saying these are 
different cases of the same thing we have here. To

22:40.503 --> 22:44.987
me, that's when planetary science, as I see 
planetary science, began. Of all the discoveries

22:47.589 --> 22:53.254
that have come about in the last 30 years, what Was 
it really most astounding to you, the one that

22:53.909 --> 23:00.216
you'd say, I never would have thought of that, or I 
never would have believed that? The volcanoes on

23:00.657 --> 23:02.178
Mars. There was just something wonderful about 
them. I was ready to accept that Mars had never had

23:07.324 --> 23:11.789
plate tectonics. But it had never occurred to me 
that instead of plate tectonics, you would have

23:13.711 --> 23:23.342
activity that just sat there and piled up. And that 
concept is just neat. Do you think planetary

23:30.493 --> 23:42.485
astronomers and planetary scientists have done a 
good job in selling themselves, or as good a job as

23:30.493 --> 23:42.485
they could have, to the public and to the Congress? 
I think they've done an excellent job of selling

23:42.505 --> 23:47.190
themselves to the public. I travel a lot. I'm on a 
lot of committees. And if I'm on a plane and

23:51.841 --> 24:02.033
somebody opens a conversation that I really don't 
want to pursue, asking me what I do, I tell them I'm

23:51.841 --> 24:02.033
an astrophysicist and that's the end of that 
conversation. I tell them I work in planetary

24:03.315 --> 24:08.261
science and the conversation will last until the 
plane lands. I think that's a good measure of the

24:08.281 --> 24:10.524
fact we've done it. Selling ourselves to 
Congress. That's another question.

24:21.541 --> 24:27.149
I think we have probably done a better job of that 
than most of the other physical sciences.

24:33.158 --> 24:48.780
What effect, if any, do you think on public 
interest and funding is the fact that we found no

24:33.158 --> 24:48.780
trace whatsoever of light anywhere in the solar 
system, except in particular not on Mars?

24:50.212 --> 24:57.762
I think that stimulated our funding during the 
period of time that we were on our survey of the

24:50.212 --> 24:57.762
solar system. We're now past that. I think it may 
actually curtail our funding now because I think

25:00.106 --> 25:09.819
what we have done with that is that we have made 
people more aware that this is all we got and we

25:00.106 --> 25:09.819
better save it. So I think in the long run, our 
efforts have actually done a better job of selling

25:15.862 --> 25:25.812
the need to really understand this planet as a 
unit, so that we probably enhanced the area we now

25:15.862 --> 25:25.812
refer to as our sciences.

25:28.755 --> 25:34.702
How did planetary studies get started at New 
Mexico State? In the 50s, Clyde W. Tombaugh, who

25:34.722 --> 25:42.730
had moved to White Sands, At White Sands, he set up 
tracking cameras for studying the ballistic

25:43.148 --> 25:53.224
trajectories of various test rockets and that 
sort of thing. And in the mid-50s, he decided that

25:54.025 --> 26:09.510
he wanted to free himself up from some of the 
details that he was forced to accept if he

25:54.025 --> 26:09.510
continued to live at the White Sands Proving 
Grounds. So he requested the right from the

26:09.980 --> 26:17.530
military to move his contracts to New Mexico State 
University, which was a small university. Its

26:18.391 --> 26:25.140
research was very centered in the central office, 
which would give him first-class service. So he

26:25.160 --> 26:26.963
moved to New Mexico State. Among the people that he 
had acquired to work with him at White Sands was

26:27.924 --> 26:35.173
Frederick Smith. And after they moved to New 
Mexico State, and the two of them worked as a team to

26:39.562 --> 26:57.328
develop ground-based monitoring of basically 
Mars when they first started, with an eye toward

26:39.562 --> 26:57.328
understanding the seasonal aspects for space 
exploration. And then later they acquired the

26:57.969 --> 27:05.080
services of Elmer Rees, a gifted amateur 
astronomer all of the right attributes to be an

27:05.633 --> 27:10.484
outstanding observational scientist. Where did 
they get the money to do this? At first it was Air

27:14.032 --> 27:21.229
Force, and then they moved to NASA for

27:14.032 --> 27:21.229
me. Were you the next hire that came along? No. 
Clyde had a faculty slot in earth sciences. And he

27:31.251 --> 27:42.990
expanded his contracts to the point that he had an 
observing team, which I think he had as many as five

27:31.251 --> 27:42.990
observers on staff at a time. I was the first PhD to 
join his staff. And Clyde was still the PI of the

27:47.669 --> 27:55.398
group when I joined, although he retired soon 
after that, and Brad Smith became the PI. Now, what

27:56.680 --> 27:59.423
happened then? I mean, what department were you 
in? I was in earth science. And in 1969, the

28:05.450 --> 28:16.984
astronomy separated from earth science and 
became an individual department.

28:18.955 --> 28:22.080
William Reitmeyer was the department head. And by 
the time I arrived, there were three

28:22.140 --> 28:32.076
stellar galactic type astronomers. And Herb 
Beebe was the theoretician. He was actually a

28:38.205 --> 28:40.609
solar astronomer. So the fact that the Sacramento 
Peak Observatory was there was extremely

28:41.078 --> 28:52.069
attractive to him, because he could do his 
observing there and then do his modeling at the

28:41.078 --> 28:52.069
university. Well, what's happened since then? I 
mean, what's happened to the astronomy

28:55.112 --> 28:59.216
department? Has it grown much? Over the years, we 
attempted several times to set up an effective

29:01.579 --> 29:10.528
consortium to build a large telescope. We have 
managed to do that. University

29:13.197 --> 29:25.990
of Chicago, Princeton University, University of 
Washington and Washington State and New Mexico

29:13.197 --> 29:25.990
State have developed a consortium. Recently, 
Johns Hopkins and the Institute of Advanced

29:26.991 --> 29:33.497
Studies at Princeton have come in. We have a 3 and 1 
half meter honeycomb type Naismith-focused

29:40.816 --> 29:47.604
telescope that will be coming online within the 
next six months. It's now waiting for its

29:47.724 --> 29:49.386
secondary. Everything else is in position and 
tested. And it will be located, it is located at?

29:54.992 --> 30:02.401
Apache Peak, which is 100 miles from the campus on 
paved, maintained roads. And we have remote

30:03.522 --> 30:06.185
observing capabilities. How many faculty do you 
have now on the university campus? in the

30:08.980 --> 30:12.064
astronomy department? We have two planetary 
astronomers that are on tenure track. Myself is

30:17.192 --> 30:22.700
tenured and we have a junior person who has been 
with us for a year and a half. That's Mark Marley.

30:25.464 --> 30:32.053
Then we have Jack Burns is our current department 
head and he is a radio astronomer. Interacts

30:32.114 --> 30:35.138
considerably with the VLA. Renee Walterbos 
galactic astronomy. Walt Sanders and

30:41.951 --> 30:57.274
Kurt Anderson, both stellar population galactic 
structure types. Bernie McNamara, variable

30:58.436 --> 31:05.667
stars, catastrophic variable stars.

31:07.047 --> 31:09.870
That's the tenure track group. We have Bill Weber, 
retired from New Hampshire, high energy

31:11.191 --> 31:18.019
astrophysics. He's a university professor. Nick 
Devereaux, a young NASA investigator, galactic

31:22.163 --> 31:28.790
astronomy. Andre Klippen, the We have developed 
an endowment in honor of Clyde Tombaugh, and

31:33.592 --> 31:44.969
Andrei, a Soviet cosmologist, is our first 
fellow.

31:49.615 --> 31:53.121
Do you planetary types talk with the other 
astronomers much? Oh, yes, yes. As a matter of

31:55.704 --> 31:57.507
fact, The major thrust that's developing in 
galactic astronomy at New Mexico State is

31:57.841 --> 32:05.251
hydrodynamics.

32:07.014 --> 32:12.501
Yes, because hydrodynamics is quite well 
developed in planetary astronomy. Mark Marley is

32:12.601 --> 32:17.788
quite interested in energy balance in the upper 
atmosphere, and so am I. So the overlaps with the

32:21.652 --> 32:28.040
Most newly acquired galactic people are open, 
friendly, and very collaborative. Some of the

32:28.061 --> 32:38.534
older traditional astronomers are still sitting 
off in their stuffy corners, but they're

32:28.061 --> 32:38.534
literally isolated from both sides now. Well, 
Chris, do you have the advantage that you don't

32:38.554 --> 32:44.322
just have a snapshot, which is all you get? Well, 
you can actually see things changing on Jupiter,

32:44.342 --> 32:49.549
which makes it a little more tricky to... make 
predictions. Actually, our radio astronomers

32:51.231 --> 32:55.678
can see things changing, too. These supersonic 
jets change with time, too. So the concepts of

33:00.425 --> 33:06.915
modeling and displaying time changes and that 
sort of thing really do overlap. That brings me to

33:06.935 --> 33:18.372
another point, which is that radio astronomy, 
which is what I started out in, was really founded

33:06.935 --> 33:18.372
not by astronomers but by engineers. And in the 
50s, well, 40s and 50s, it had a hard time getting

33:18.571 --> 33:35.435
started in this country because the astronomers 
at the time had about the same attitude towards the

33:18.571 --> 33:35.435
dirty engineering work as they did towards 
looking at the planets. And radio astronomy has

33:36.616 --> 33:44.587
never had a bias, as far as I know, against 
planetary astronomy. How do you get along with the

33:44.727 --> 33:46.570
radio astronomers now? because it's a new 
generation of people. The old timers are mostly

33:50.570 --> 33:52.033
gone. But I wanted your opinion on that. And many of 
the numerics are so parallel. Around

33:57.783 --> 34:07.099
the turn of this century, planetary astronomy was 
still a significant part of astronomy. Henry

34:08.502 --> 34:12.068
Norris Russell did papers on the atmosphere of 
Venus and so forth. But by the end of World War I, it

34:13.094 --> 34:16.679
was basically dead. I mean, there were a few people 
still working, but it was basically dead. Who or

34:21.307 --> 34:26.014
what killed it, in your opinion?

34:28.838 --> 34:35.288
OK, thanks for your question.

34:36.500 --> 34:40.947
And probably the lack of infrared observations 
coming along at the right time. We really had a

34:42.129 --> 34:50.201
dearth of new observational input.

34:50.221 --> 34:54.207
And most of the interesting spectral features are 
in the infrared, unfortunately. The development

34:54.227 --> 35:04.583
of large telescopes that did not enhance our 
spatial resolution sort of made the planets not

34:54.227 --> 35:04.583
that desirable. And then the fact that we weren't 
able to use those large light buckets to reach into

35:05.120 --> 35:16.793
another frequency domain and give us some more 
constraints is probably what really put it down.

35:16.813 --> 35:21.598
Gerard de Baccalaure has a vehement two-word 
answer to that question. Percival law. Do you

35:24.401 --> 35:29.767
think that had an effect?

35:29.787 --> 35:30.408
No, I don't. I think the fact that you see too many 
bubbles of air, Earth's air, in a big telescope had

35:35.731 --> 35:47.410
the biggest effect, because much of the money was 
being recruited to support the big telescopes.

35:47.430 --> 35:50.475
And we really weren't competitive on them. We 
really couldn't pull new, exciting information

35:50.495 --> 35:53.560
out. If the spatial resolution had been directly 
proportional to the diameter of the telescope,

35:54.281 --> 36:02.515
Percival Lowell couldn't have touched us. The 
idea of what we would have seen on Mars would have

36:03.102 --> 36:11.311
just been so intriguing that... I wanted to ask 
you, this is a detail that may not get in the book,

36:11.472 --> 36:16.237
but I want your opinion. You know, now with CCDs you 
can beat the scene and take pictures of, in

36:17.398 --> 36:31.995
particular Mars, that look like the sort of stuff 
that those of us who have looked at Mars through

36:17.398 --> 36:31.995
telescopes will occasionally see but could never 
photograph or even draw. Were

36:32.448 --> 36:46.805
you relieved to see that those images actually 
were just like what you'd been seeing in the past?

36:46.825 --> 36:47.906
Sure. The idea of being able to record and then go 
back and analyze is always exciting. Sure, you

36:53.913 --> 36:55.314
believe what you see. After you understand how the 
human eye interprets things, you know that those

36:55.495 --> 37:01.982
details are there. But you can't remember them. 
You can't intercompare them. The classical

37:08.405 --> 37:13.815
example of this is Elmer Rees, who had observed an 
excellent observer. And when he was finally

37:14.797 --> 37:22.873
allowed to have the A Mountain, the Tortugas 
Mountain, photographic record, So he could go

37:23.107 --> 37:30.096
back and see what a south equatorial belt storm 
looked like in 71 and compare it to 75. It was like,

37:30.136 --> 37:37.825
you know, manna from heaven.

37:39.347 --> 37:48.979
One thing that's been a petty annoyance of mine, 
and I wonder if it's been of yours, is that the

37:39.347 --> 37:48.979
pictures they release of Mars and the whole disk 
from various spacecraft don't look like it looks

37:49.465 --> 37:52.669
when you look directly at it. They fiddle around 
with the data. Does that kind of tick you off? Yes,

37:59.258 --> 38:00.660
it kind of ticks me off. And there's a fair amount of 
it going on now in ground base, too. High pass

38:05.106 --> 38:16.722
filtering, edge finders being used to really 
enhance the edge structures, total destruction

38:05.106 --> 38:16.722
of the photometry. One of the things that bothers 
me a little bit about the Voyager representation

38:17.258 --> 38:35.027
of Jupiter is the fact that in order to get high 
contrast images into the American living room, we

38:17.258 --> 38:35.027
grossly enhance the color. And we have left the 
public with a concept of the appearance of these

38:35.888 --> 38:42.459
cloud decks. It's wrong. Lately, there's been a 
fair amount of effort to make planetary science

38:44.427 --> 38:57.661
practical, and there's certainly been a lot of 
publicity about killer asteroids and comets, the

38:44.427 --> 38:57.661
ozone layer, global warming. Do you think that's 
gone too far, or do you think it's just about right,

38:59.924 --> 39:05.450
or not enough? I think it's gone too far. I don't 
think that that is the real application of

39:07.191 --> 39:13.198
planetary science. I think that The real 
application of planetary science in the field of

39:14.566 --> 39:27.168
education is the idea of physical processes. More 
than one laboratory to understand what has gone on

39:29.132 --> 39:34.802
over time. developing the general understanding 
of time dependence on Earth. We could do real

39:40.165 --> 39:42.247
structures there. Killer asteroids is, I don't 
think planetary people invented that. I think SDI

39:47.572 --> 39:51.396
people invented that, looking for a home. And I 
think that's appalling. I think it's misleading.

39:59.324 --> 40:03.388
I think it's asking the American public to pay 
attention to something that is not as likely to

40:04.195 --> 40:12.948
happen as some of the other pending catastrophes 
that we should be expending resources on.

40:14.651 --> 40:15.853
What do you think is going to happen? Well, first of 
all, do you think planetary astronomy is kind of

40:15.873 --> 40:22.263
mined out now or not? No, I don't think so. I think 
that,

40:24.947 --> 40:30.996
well, I talk to elementary students a lot 
Elementary students are ready to go to the moon,

40:32.528 --> 40:37.232
even if they have to live in a hole. As long as I will 
let them have television, they would love to go to

40:37.313 --> 40:41.877
the moon. The concept of a 14-day day is 
fascinating to them. Sixth graders would like to

40:49.624 --> 41:01.135
take pregnant women to the moon so they can watch 
the children grow up under low G.

41:01.503 --> 41:06.208
It's this concept of just a little different 
environment. I think we've still got a lot of very

41:08.111 --> 41:14.178
interesting, stimulating stuff. And this is 
aiming toward really improving education,

41:14.238 --> 41:22.848
really improving the critical ability of the next 
generation. Do you think there will be money to

41:24.270 --> 41:29.856
support planetary astronomy in any significant 
amount in the next few years? No, I think we're

41:31.726 --> 41:39.276
headed toward a period of time where the support 
really is going to decrease. And then I think that

41:40.357 --> 41:49.068
maybe 20 years from now, we'll see an increase in 
interest in it again, and it'll come back. I forgot

41:50.230 --> 41:54.515
to ask you one thing about the situation in New 
Mexico State. Now, it was a small college 30 years

41:54.575 --> 42:00.062
ago.

42:01.325 --> 42:14.183
How would you characterize the attitude of the 
higher-ups there, you know, whatever they are,

42:01.325 --> 42:14.183
the regents or the deans or the presidents or 
chancellors, towards having, you know, a real

42:01.325 --> 42:14.183
research group, and in particular astronomy? 
Were they amazed that there was such a subject? No,

42:17.688 --> 42:29.745
not at all, because the proper people of Pasadena

42:17.688 --> 42:29.745
chased the Caltech people out of Arroyo Seque. to 
the White Sands Proving Ground so that the

42:30.367 --> 42:43.439
development of the space program is very closely 
associated with New Mexico in the minds of most of

42:30.367 --> 42:43.439
the people there. The first

42:44.520 --> 42:57.572
satellite that was to go into Earth orbit that 
didn't get off the launch pad carried a

42:44.520 --> 42:57.572
communications package that had been built at New 
Mexico State. New Mexico State has been very

42:58.463 --> 43:15.525
strong in telemetry and communications, so that 
we came in to this area from the technological

42:58.463 --> 43:15.525
side, and the physical science was second to 
develop there, but it was natural that it did

42:58.463 --> 43:15.525
develop there. New Mexico State has a very large 
involvement in military funding.

43:26.680 --> 43:28.082
They entrapped process and deliver a large 
portion of the data that's acquired at the White

43:29.210 --> 43:39.766
Sands Missile Range.

43:41.068 --> 43:54.208
You're undoubtedly aware of the fact that 
astronomy is, I guess without, astronomy in

43:41.068 --> 43:54.208
general and planetary astronomy in particular, 
is the most popular science with the general

43:41.068 --> 43:54.208
public. How come

43:59.467 --> 44:03.913
Well, it's not quite as mundane as Earth-based 
science. There's still a little bit of the

44:03.993 --> 44:07.918
fascination of science fiction in it. But at the 
same time, because people have been living on a

44:09.920 --> 44:16.548
planet, they've got all the fundamental basis for 
understanding it. So it's something that's

44:16.689 --> 44:21.334
familiar but mind-stretching at the same time. 
It's been my opinion that astronomy is the best

44:23.697 --> 44:27.482
carrot that you can use as a teacher to get people to 
learn science. Do you agree?

44:37.386 --> 44:37.726
No. And elementary students like bugs just as 
well. When does that start to change? About the

44:47.038 --> 44:48.139
sixth grade. Any idea why?

44:53.206 --> 44:55.208
I guess they get tired of bugs. When you've done 
Grasshoppers 2, how far can you go?
