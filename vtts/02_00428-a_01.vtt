00:04.705 --> 00:07.888
This is the second interview with General Becker. 
Today is July 2nd, 1981, and last time we were

00:07.908 --> 00:16.997
talking about, I think we finished a conversation 
on the Philippines. Is that true? Well, we got into

00:20.200 --> 00:24.103
the invasion of the Philippines. Yeah, we were 
talking about that. We could wind that up by

00:26.266 --> 00:31.611
briefly concluding the campaign in the 
Philippines. We haven't done that. Of course, my

00:35.654 --> 00:45.487
entire World War II experience was with the 1st 
Cavalry Division, which had been organized,

00:35.654 --> 00:45.487
reorganized really as a light infantry division. 
And from that invasion of the Lady Islands, the

00:47.931 --> 01:00.809
division went on up to Luzon,

00:47.931 --> 01:00.809
the major island, you know. Right. And some of our 
proudest accomplishments resulted from that

01:02.249 --> 01:07.974
operation. We went into after the invasion of 
Luzon by other forces. And General Walsh Kruger,

01:16.202 --> 01:32.037
the 6th Army Commander,

01:16.202 --> 01:32.037
gave the first count on the mission to proceed 
through all other units straight to Manila, which

01:16.202 --> 01:32.037
was 300 kilometers away. to

01:32.793 --> 01:39.059
seize the seat of government, the Malacanon 
Palace. Our first objective was to liberate the

01:39.760 --> 01:45.465
prisoners at Santa Tomas University. And the 
division was provided tanks and trucks to put

01:47.587 --> 01:59.138
everybody on wheels or tracks and just set go. In 
three days we were there and those missions were

02:00.518 --> 02:05.023
accomplished. In three days you went 300 
kilometers? Yeah. How was the fighting? Well, it

02:08.466 --> 02:15.393
was only very light because we just completely 
surprised the enemy. It was very light until we'd

02:15.593 --> 02:18.756
actually seized the objective. Of course, there 
were some small battles along the way. But it was

02:25.583 --> 02:29.327
very successful because of the element of 
surprise and speed of the And they'd never seen

02:30.185 --> 02:36.815
anything like that, of course, in the war, in the 
jungles. Well, of course, in Luzon, you had a

02:37.055 --> 02:41.622
fairly decent road net, and this was possible. And 
then, of course, the laborious process of

02:43.485 --> 02:58.707
cleaning the enemy out of Manila followed, 
because as time went on, of course, they step in

02:43.485 --> 02:58.707
there, resolve in resistance, and it took some 
months. to get that job done before we aimed at

03:00.037 --> 03:09.265
invasion of Japan, which will come later I'm 
guessing here, which thankfully never occurred.

03:09.426 --> 03:09.746
Right. In the Philippines, the Japanese had a 
General Yamashita, who was a so-called Tiger of

03:10.687 --> 03:28.643
Manila, and he was the first man after the Second 
World War to be

03:29.078 --> 03:33.923
to be found guilty of war crimes and then executed. 
You were right there on the scene and of course this

03:35.625 --> 03:43.192
caused a flap early in 1946 and it has since. You 
were right there on the scene. How did the Jap- how

03:44.533 --> 03:49.939
did the Japanese soldiers behave? Were they 
committing war crimes in your opinion? Well I

03:54.183 --> 03:55.204
think this evidence used against Jim Ashita 
related to the initial battle of the Philippines.

04:06.915 --> 04:16.931
In which our troops at Corregidor Baton in the 
Philippines surrendered to the Japanese and then

04:06.915 --> 04:16.931
were so badly mistreated from then to the end of the 
war. But the death march, for example, occurred

04:17.032 --> 04:22.761
then.

04:24.580 --> 04:37.599
But to answer your question, I have no, I did not 
witness,

04:24.580 --> 04:37.599
of course, I wouldn't witness directly any 
Japanese atrocities. I think we saw evidence of

04:38.300 --> 04:40.483
atrocities. For example? Well. The Filipinos, of 
course, they were supposed to be. Yeah, it's that

04:44.509 --> 04:49.816
sort of thing, it's a surmise because you don't see 
it. But when you see mutilations, for example, of

04:49.956 --> 04:53.862
certain types. There were bodies mutilated along 
the road when you were going to Manila? At times.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.871
You'd see this in different areas. Now, it's a 
gruesome thing to get into, but was the person dead

05:03.813 --> 05:11.200
before or after? But I think the thing we all 
recognized was that the individual Japanese

05:12.001 --> 05:23.612
soldier was a very good fighting soldier.

05:24.250 --> 05:33.061
I think as you got up to their larger units, they 
were less a match for our corresponding units. But

05:33.081 --> 05:45.095
the one thing that made the Japanese soldier so 
effective was that he was trained and conditioned

05:33.081 --> 05:45.095
and motivated to fight to the death. And given that 
conviction, he'll do anything until he's killed.

05:54.710 --> 06:01.899
And very few of them didn't have the courage to do 
that, you know, fight to the death. More so than

06:02.920 --> 06:05.984
Americans? Well,

06:06.004 --> 06:11.651
we at least didn't teach that philosophy. But I 
don't think you'll find any more courageous

06:13.193 --> 06:18.080
soldiers anywhere than the American soldiers. I 
think our particulates as larger units, but even

06:18.100 --> 06:23.907
on the small unit level, our tactics were so 
superior to the Japanese that the fact was we

06:24.393 --> 06:52.948
usually won our battles and our soldiers were very 
seldom found in such desperate situations that

06:24.393 --> 06:52.948
they'd ever have to make a choice like that well you 
said before we didn't teach that philosophy

06:24.393 --> 06:52.948
toward

06:24.393 --> 06:52.948
well the philosophy taught the Japanese fight to 
the death or do yourself in what did we teach Well, I

06:53.485 --> 07:15.291
think we concentrated on preparing soldiers for 
battle and certainly any

06:53.485 --> 07:15.291
soldier, particularly the doughboy, whose job is 
to close with the enemy and seize critical

06:53.485 --> 07:15.291
terrain, recognizes that You don't have to tell 
him he'll fight to the death. He knows that he'll go

07:18.505 --> 07:21.828
to the objective, whatever is required. He is 
committed to the objective. Now, no commander is

07:25.851 --> 07:31.376
going to waste life intentionally. He's not going 
to get people in a situation where the casualties

07:31.436 --> 07:41.545
are going to be

07:31.436 --> 07:41.545
unexpected or unreasonable. But you can't define 
those things in any given situation. to the finite

07:46.557 --> 08:14.168
point

07:46.557 --> 08:14.168
but I think

07:46.557 --> 08:14.168
there's no apology to be made for the American 
soldier in any war that I've no I just wanted a

07:46.557 --> 08:14.168
difference between the two his individual 
courage to do whatever is necessary to the death

07:46.557 --> 08:14.168
what were the conditions when he got to Manila when 
we got to Manila of course it was intact run down

08:15.633 --> 08:19.600
some because the economy had been affected so 
much. The General MacArthur's orders were that we

08:20.862 --> 08:42.417
would not use artillery or bombing within the city 
unless it was an absolutely essential thing and

08:20.862 --> 08:42.417
then our headquarters would help decide that 
because he wanted to retake the city without

08:44.017 --> 08:48.442
serious damage and devastation. But of course, 
that didn't work because the Japanese just

08:48.462 --> 09:01.216
started systematically demolishing the areas in 
the areas in which they retained control until

08:48.462 --> 09:01.216
they were pushed out. So in the end, the city was 
pretty badly destroyed, parts of it were. And some

09:06.161 --> 09:09.805
parts we had to lift that policy, of course.

09:13.379 --> 09:21.487
So both sides contributed to destruction in the 
areas which we had to fight. Were the Filipinos

09:21.507 --> 09:23.490
happy to see you coming? Oh, they certainly were.

09:27.273 --> 09:28.014
They certainly were. I guess, you know, our troops 
having come through so many hundreds and hundreds

09:28.194 --> 09:43.150
of miles of jungles to get there and to see that 
reaction, even in Leyte, in that initial invasion

09:28.194 --> 09:43.150
of the Philippines, uh kind of made you realize 
better what what you were fighting for you know

09:44.176 --> 10:11.753
it was a boost to the troops it really was of course a 
tremendous boost to the people of the Philippines

09:44.176 --> 10:11.753
when they realized that we were back

09:44.176 --> 10:11.753
were there other problems with securing the area 
of course we left we left the Philippines before

09:44.176 --> 10:11.753
the enemy was totally defeated to move on

10:14.804 --> 10:15.325
That's true. As a matter of fact, our

10:15.385 --> 10:32.404
division, 1st Cavalry Division, wound up in 
southern Luzon

10:15.385 --> 10:32.404
in a camp preparing to go into the invasion of 
Japan. Let's see, I guess it was August we came and

10:33.245 --> 10:41.554
assembled there, August of 45.

10:45.095 --> 10:55.208
And

10:45.095 --> 10:55.208
then, of course, the atomic bomb was dropped in 
late August, or in August. July and August, we

10:55.529 --> 10:56.950
assembled there. And the war was over. But we were 
immediately put on ships to go out to move into

11:00.916 --> 11:12.030
Yokohama and Tokyo, our division was, to secure 
the area for occupation. Do you remember what you

11:12.601 --> 11:15.164
were feeling? Shortly after we left, and after the 
surrender, I understand that there were some

11:15.184 --> 11:29.741
4,000 Japanese troops surrendered very near 
where our division camp had been in the mountains

11:15.184 --> 11:29.741
above there. We'd been fighting, but we really 
didn't realize there were that many troops in

11:29.761 --> 11:34.747
there. So you're right. We certainly hadn't wiped 
them out. Do you remember your feelings? In

11:41.288 --> 11:43.571
August, when you heard about the atomic bomb? I 
sure do. I thought

11:45.554 --> 11:53.966
it was a very courageous decision of President 
Truman to do this. Of course, it was just the fact

11:54.026 --> 11:58.192
that we had the thing. This was our first 
knowledge. It was just almost unbelievable. And

12:03.220 --> 12:09.709
then to hear the

12:03.220 --> 12:09.709
description of the effects of it was just beyond 
because it was such a great leap from any measure of

12:10.617 --> 12:16.765
effectiveness that we'd ever known. It was 
awe-inspiring,

12:19.149 --> 12:23.254
I would say. And then, of course, we were, after the 
news of the first bomb, we just couldn't see how

12:24.676 --> 12:40.017
anyone could, any enemy could continue, and sure 
enough, it wasn't long until that was a fact, and

12:41.026 --> 12:58.941
Everybody was relieved we didn't have to fight in 
Japan, because I think that would have been

12:41.026 --> 12:58.941
extremely... Having seen how the individual 
Japanese fought in the jungles, thousands of

12:41.026 --> 12:58.941
miles away from home, we could see some measure of 
the task ahead in defeating the Japanese on their

12:41.026 --> 12:58.941
home ground. Now, since the dropping of the bomb, 
that maneuver by, or that action by Truman has

13:01.443 --> 13:10.611
caused a lot of a lot of debate among different 
groups in America, people saying that, well, we

13:10.912 --> 13:22.147
shouldn't have done it, and other people saying 
that we should have, some saying it was against

13:10.912 --> 13:22.147
humanitarian law, whatever that is. What was your 
opinion? Oh, no question. I've never felt that it

13:26.373 --> 13:29.957
was a mistake. It's a shame that those people had to 
be sacrificed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But at

13:38.228 --> 13:39.450
the same time, great multiples of Japanese lives 
in excess of that would have been lost, in my

13:40.865 --> 13:49.375
opinion, had we had to invade Japan. Not to mention 
our losses, which I think President Truman was

13:51.858 --> 14:00.367
absolutely correct. He was in a position to 
estimate. He had estimates, I'm sure. He was in a

14:04.132 --> 14:05.353
position to know. In general, what the prospects 
were for the alternative invasion. And I've never

14:13.041 --> 14:14.944
seen those figures. I may have heard them at some 
time, but I'm sure that he couldn't in good

14:15.425 --> 14:24.718
conscience sacrifice that many American lives 
when he had the tool in his hand to prevent it. No

14:26.680 --> 14:27.562
president could. Do you remember where you were on 
B.J. Day? On V-J Day,

14:36.265 --> 14:53.742
I was, I don't remember the exact spot, but I was,

14:36.265 --> 14:53.742
you talking about the surrender day? Yeah. The 
actual surrender day of the ceremony. Oh, I

14:56.905 --> 14:58.026
remember that very well. I finally recall where I 
was when I first learned that the emperors said we

14:58.126 --> 15:02.710
were going to quit. September the 1st? It was early 
September. September the 1st, I believe, or the

15:06.274 --> 15:07.996
3rd. Yes. I was aboard a naval ship with the major 
elements in a convoy that consisted of the major

15:11.340 --> 15:30.340
elements of our 1st Cavalry Division sailing into 
Tokyo

15:11.340 --> 15:30.340
Bay Harbor. And as a matter of fact, we had coming 
over our ship's radio broadcast of General

15:37.184 --> 15:42.490
MacArthur's ceremony on the battleship Missouri 
just across the water there. So you were in the bay,

15:43.171 --> 15:44.192
actually? So we were coming in to land at the time 
they were actually signing that ceremony. See,

15:50.059 --> 15:52.883
we'd been alerted to come on up. Now, the 11th 
Airborne Division had flown elements into

15:52.903 --> 16:01.573
Yokohama ahead of us. And when we arrived, they 
went on inland to another area. and uh but yes that

16:07.542 --> 16:32.436
was a very dramatic moment for all of us who I'm sure 
all of these ships were receiving that broadcast

16:07.542 --> 16:32.436
and we were right there physically passing the 
Missouri at the time I bet you they really had the

16:07.542 --> 16:32.436
Missouri decked out well we couldn't see too well 
But, of course, having seen later the movies of it,

16:33.462 --> 16:41.249
you know, the moving pictures of it, it was a 
tremendously dramatic moment of history. Were

16:41.269 --> 16:42.470
there a lot of ships in the bay? Yes, there were 
quite a number. Of course, a lot of Navy in there at

16:45.153 --> 16:46.874
that time. What were you on? We were on a LST, my 
outfit was.

16:55.742 --> 16:57.143
And we were very lightly equipped. We left much of 
our heavier equipment back because they wanted us

16:57.183 --> 17:03.469
up there real fast and put us- I said LST, we were on a 
an APA I'm sorry the LST was considered to be too

17:04.090 --> 17:33.372
slow and they came later with the rest of the 
division bringing the heavier equipment but we

17:04.090 --> 17:33.372
came all that whole convoy was APA or faster and so 
we moved very rapidly in there and then it was very

17:04.090 --> 17:33.372
interesting and a rather puzzling thing we went so 
hurriedly because all this occurred you know

17:04.090 --> 17:33.372
after the atomic bomb was dropped and moved so 
rapidly. I'm sure John MacArthur's headquarters

17:38.131 --> 17:51.110
had long had tentative plans for occupation of 
Japan, but it would have appeared before August of

17:38.131 --> 17:51.110
1945 that that date was way in the future. But when 
we loaded up the light elements of our division to

17:52.592 --> 18:03.527
go to Tokyo, Yokohama, after we got aboard, we were 
given general plan and instructions for the

18:04.722 --> 18:11.089
occupation of the areas we were to be assigned once 
we got there. Once we got there our division was

18:12.891 --> 18:24.623
told to go ashore in the dock areas of Yokohama and 
remain there and not move out of the dock area until

18:12.891 --> 18:24.623
further orders. We knew that there were about a 
quarter million Japanese troops in this area at

18:26.845 --> 18:33.092
the time and this surrender everyone was very 
hopeful of course that it would stick and that this

18:34.338 --> 18:59.164
meant everybody was going to surrender and that 
turned out of course to be the case so you had no

18:34.338 --> 18:59.164
incidents in which a troop would start shooting at 
Americans I know of none it was a remarkable thing

18:34.338 --> 18:59.164
I must say that I some others were so curious I got in 
a jeep and I'll never forget this I got in a jeep with

19:00.393 --> 19:28.763
one of my officers I was commanding the 6th 1st 
People's Artillery Battalion at that time

19:00.393 --> 19:28.763
and a driver and just drove out a bit to just have a 
little bit of a look at the city and the Japanese had

19:00.393 --> 19:28.763
been instructed to continue their normal routine 
we came out at about quitting time in the afternoon

19:29.789 --> 19:33.393
Masses of people were out on the street waiting for 
streetcars. And as we would drive by, they would

19:35.134 --> 19:42.402
all turn their backs to us. No kidding. They'd turn 
their backs. If they were in the bus and someone

19:44.984 --> 19:49.749
looked out and saw us, they'd turn their faces 
away. And yet there was never a, this was their, I

19:51.971 --> 19:58.598
guess, a way of showing their embarrassment.

20:02.746 --> 20:32.584
that is fascinating there was in those early days 
and thereafter there was never any really

20:02.746 --> 20:32.584
hostility it was an amazing experience

20:02.746 --> 20:32.584
I think the of course one thing he shows is the great 
discipline of the Japanese

20:02.746 --> 20:32.584
and all those troops in the months weeks and months 
later all those troops were disarmed disbanded

20:32.969 --> 20:34.811
Japanese. All that equipment gathered up. That 
was a tremendous task. You can't imagine what a

20:40.398 --> 20:49.369
task the occupation forces had initially in 
gathering up all this. There were ammunition

20:49.649 --> 20:54.535
dumps with thousands of tons of ammunition. What 
do you do with all that stuff? What did you do? Well,

20:57.298 --> 20:58.960
I think most of it went into the ocean. airplanes on 
airfields. How do you destroy them? My unit, the

21:04.009 --> 21:11.737
direct support field artillery battalion, had 
the mission of putting out of action hundreds of

21:04.009 --> 21:11.737
aircraft on an airfield. How'd you do it? Well, we 
did it with,

21:14.480 --> 21:19.865
what do you call that stuff? What we do is try to get 
into the engine with a, it's not an explosive, but

21:20.486 --> 21:30.516
it's a very hot burning material. and you know melt 
enough of it to be inoperable

21:31.475 --> 22:00.604
and of course all kinds of weapons and things to be 
done so uh and what'd you do with the weapons well

21:31.475 --> 22:00.604
did you destroy them all or did you decide to just 
keep them in the armory or no the uh most of them were

21:31.475 --> 22:00.604
destroyed or dumped was there a fear that we should 
hurry up and destroy them before the Japanese well

21:31.475 --> 22:00.604
you can imagine Japan was uh while they had a lot of 
troops in the islands that had challenged us down

22:01.597 --> 22:09.488
there, they still had their main forces at home. 
And they had a quarter million troops right around

22:10.810 --> 22:15.116
Tokyo. And you can imagine how urgent it seemed to 
our commanders, our senior commanders, Joe

22:15.136 --> 22:29.477
MacArthur and others, that this calm surrender is 
great, but we need to gather the means

22:31.229 --> 22:59.413
of equipping these people and control it so uh we 
were very busy I can imagine of course uh we were in

22:31.229 --> 22:59.413
Yokohama just a few days and then uh entered Manila 
our division uh first guy division has the pride

22:31.229 --> 22:59.413
proud uh history of being the first in Manila the 
first in Tokyo and

23:03.173 --> 23:13.365
and the first to reach the 38th parallel in Korea in 
the Korean War. But going into Tokyo was quite a

23:13.425 --> 23:16.769
dramatic moment. Tell me about that. Well, of 
course, the whole division didn't march in. The

23:21.214 --> 23:30.885
division commander with General MacArthur, 
Admiral Halsey, and a combat unit of the division

23:32.013 --> 23:34.717
As I recall, it was a- So about how many men? It 
seemed to me it was about 500 men, very small. It was

23:38.462 --> 23:41.887
relatively, of course, the rest of the division is 
right there. Made that initial entry and

23:42.768 --> 23:49.218
proceeded to the US Embassy and raised the 
American flag.

23:52.062 --> 23:53.824
And I've got a picture here somewhere of that. And 
you all marched. And these troops, I was not among

23:56.148 --> 24:01.395
those troops, and these troops marched in 
vehicles. into Tokyo and of course the Japanese

24:02.455 --> 24:28.311
were cooperative from the very beginning and this 
really signaled the commencement of the

24:02.455 --> 24:28.311
occupation then troops kept coming in of other 
divisions and being deployed to various parts of

24:02.455 --> 24:28.311
the country to occupy and again disarm the troops 
the Japanese troops and take control of the

24:02.455 --> 24:28.311
equipment and

24:31.227 --> 24:58.332
Some very strange things happened because I 
mentioned earlier the occupation instructions,

24:31.227 --> 24:58.332
which included, for example, the usual things 
that historically have been done, like taking

24:31.227 --> 24:58.332
control of the government buildings and the post 
offices and the radio stations and the means of

24:31.227 --> 24:58.332
communication, in other words, and the airports.

25:01.366 --> 25:29.247
seaports

25:01.366 --> 25:29.247
before we actually landed in Yokohama that day 
that I described I guess the first I think first

25:01.366 --> 25:29.247
September we were instructed to disregard

25:01.366 --> 25:29.247
the plan and orders for occupation go ashore and 
await further instructions

25:01.366 --> 25:29.247
that's a that's a rather

25:32.517 --> 25:45.454
disturbing order when you're going ashore as one 
division with a piece of another division already

25:32.517 --> 25:45.454
there and 250,000 troops available to resist.

25:48.539 --> 25:59.233
But the reason that was done was because of course 
the Japanese authorities had been so clear that

25:48.539 --> 25:59.233
they did intend to surrender and that they would do 
what they were instructed to do. now how did you

26:00.530 --> 26:28.562
commence the surrender of these quarter of a 
million troops did you just pretty much line them

26:00.530 --> 26:28.562
up and tell them to hand how did how did this work 
many of them we would communicate basically it was

26:00.530 --> 26:28.562
a matter of communicating through their 
commanders and many of them actually disarmed

26:00.530 --> 26:28.562
themselves you know disarmed themselves 
disbanded without without there was such a vast

26:00.530 --> 26:28.562
number of them just sent home and we were just 
beginning to get in there you know we could not

26:00.530 --> 26:28.562
physically disarm It would have taken God knows 
how long. But so really, in many of those cases, the

26:32.548 --> 26:43.824
basic task for us was to get control of those arms 
that they laid down and weapons. For example, this

26:44.585 --> 26:48.330
airfield at my unit took over a matter of days after 
we got in there. I say days, probably a few weeks, as

26:51.013 --> 26:54.979
I recall. They'd already mustered out. The airmen 
just left this stuff. Left a few people in charge,

27:03.503 --> 27:10.352
of course, caretakers, security guards. But I 
never saw, by the way, I never saw any evidence of

27:11.533 --> 27:21.146
vandalism, theft, or cannibalizing equipment 
and so forth. In other words, the Japanese people

27:22.247 --> 27:27.574
were... Keep in mind, the Japanese people were 
totally demoralized. at the time we came in there.

27:31.226 --> 27:31.988
We can't imagine. I don't suppose any American can 
imagine, because we've never experienced it,

27:33.590 --> 27:46.451
what that bombing of nuclear weapons did to the 
population as a whole.

27:50.798 --> 27:56.447
And of course, the facts of the results of those 
bombings spread like wildfire through the

27:50.798 --> 27:56.447
population, you know.

27:59.583 --> 28:21.311
so they were not only disciplined and acceptable 
accepting the orders to surrender from their

27:59.583 --> 28:21.311
emperor but they were willing to surrender now 
what were the conditions like in Yokohama and

27:59.583 --> 28:21.311
Tokyo?

28:21.331 --> 28:23.454
you mean the devastation? yeah and the amount of 
food and supplies as you know they're very densely

28:30.093 --> 28:59.020
populated areas and of course the first thing you 
see all kinds of people but the cities had been very

28:30.093 --> 28:59.020
seriously damaged because you know these fire 
raids have been going on for a long long time and

28:30.093 --> 28:59.020
just vast areas of both cities were just totally 
destroyed you wondered how the cities continued

28:30.093 --> 28:59.020
to function you know with their utilities and 
their industries and their commerce but

29:00.046 --> 29:29.749
when I first went in there of course I wasn't too 
willing to even accept the Japanese as human

29:00.046 --> 29:29.749
beings because of the the kind of war they fought 
but of course you it doesn't take long to realize

29:00.046 --> 29:29.749
they are people are people wherever you find them 
in the world and most of them have the same basic

29:32.159 --> 29:59.972
mores you know but my first admiration for the 
Japanese came from observing them under these

29:32.159 --> 29:59.972
circumstances pitching in and restoring their 
homes their buildings going on about their

29:32.159 --> 29:59.972
business working hard you never saw such industry

30:01.420 --> 30:28.660
these terrible things that happened to them 
didn't stop them they just seemed to apply

30:01.420 --> 30:28.660
themselves absolutely completely to making a new 
world for themselves a new a new life

30:01.420 --> 30:28.660
I wasn't in Japan but well I left in January of 46 the 
soon after we came into Japan and And, of course, it

30:30.293 --> 30:39.426
was evident that there were other units being 
brought in, of course, in various parts of the

30:30.293 --> 30:39.426
country to conduct this occupation duty. And as it 
became absolutely clear that the Japanese were

30:39.446 --> 30:59.575
not going to resist the occupation and that we had 
control of their means of making war and of

30:39.446 --> 30:59.575
fighting locally, then, of course, our 
demobilization planning began in the U.S. Army

31:00.567 --> 31:07.395
and Navy, Air Force. So the so-called point system 
for rotation home was activated.

31:18.789 --> 31:28.701
And some of the most difficult times of my overseas 
duty during World War II came in those few months

31:18.789 --> 31:28.701
between September and January. Because all of a 
sudden, in November, all of my cohorts that I'd

31:30.115 --> 31:42.807
gone through the war with went home. General 
William C. Chase was commanding the division, and

31:44.669 --> 31:57.421
he asked all the battalion and regimental 
commanders, brigade commanders, to remain past

31:44.669 --> 31:57.421
their rotation eligibility period. All of us, of 
course, had points to go home. until we could get

31:59.967 --> 32:08.540
the division remanned and retrained to some 
degree. Well, of course, when he asked us to stay,

32:09.882 --> 32:14.168
we didn't know how long we were going to stay.

32:17.713 --> 32:21.799
It was not entirely voluntary, I might add, but he 
put it on that basis. And so we lost all of our

32:23.562 --> 32:27.628
people, just almost all of them suddenly. people 
that came into Japan with us that remained were

32:28.216 --> 32:46.112
those few replacements that had come in to replace 
casualties and

32:28.216 --> 32:46.112
losses, which would have been, oh, I don't know, 
probably not more than 15% of the troops in my

32:28.216 --> 32:46.112
battalion. And so, we got lower point men to 
replace those. But many of these were what were

32:54.600 --> 32:57.362
left in other divisions. In other words, we 
started consolidating units, you might say. But

33:04.641 --> 33:13.350
that first contingent that came in there to reman 
our units were a relatively high point, too, but

33:04.641 --> 33:13.350
not enough to go home. And then they lowered the 
point criteria, and so we'd lose practically

33:13.370 --> 33:21.497
everybody again and get another refill. It was a 
very, very turbulent period. made it extremely

33:26.705 --> 33:42.283
difficult to do this was officers and men made it 
extremely difficult to do that occupation work

33:26.705 --> 33:42.283
that had to be done but of course eventually they 
settled down and I came home in January of 46. How'd

33:43.564 --> 33:48.050
you get along and how'd your men get along with the 
Japanese people? Was there any fraternization

33:48.110 --> 33:50.472
whatsoever? Initially the instructions were 
there would be no fraternization and that was the

33:51.113 --> 33:56.239
case But, of course, as time went on,

33:56.793 --> 34:09.132
as far as my time there, let's see, I was there 
nearly six months. The fratrization, no

34:09.172 --> 34:14.259
fratrization policy was in. But later, of course, 
it changed. But we had very little access to the

34:18.165 --> 34:25.416
Japanese or contact with them, very little need 
to. because most of our work was on military

34:25.750 --> 34:31.895
installations. Very few of them were around. What 
about time off, liberty for your men? Was there a

34:37.620 --> 34:38.741
liberty schedule? Did they ever get off? Oh, yes. 
It wasn't an easy or frequent thing, but the Army

34:42.304 --> 34:55.015
immediately started setting up rest and 
recreation centers, you know, in hotels around

34:42.304 --> 34:55.015
the country. And I personally never took a day off, 
as I recall. But that was our way of giving the men a

34:59.556 --> 35:03.900
break. Send them to a fine hotel with good food and 
recreational facilities and good service, and

35:03.920 --> 35:15.431
just rest, do a little sightseeing. That seemed to 
meet those immediate needs. And of course, as time

35:19.835 --> 35:25.761
went on, after I left there, I believe frequent 
trips in places like Hong Kong things like that

35:26.720 --> 35:37.852
troops could do but basically they had recreation 
centers fairly locally. Now in 1945 when the war

35:39.594 --> 35:43.838
was over were you eager to go home? Yes, I was. The 
war was over.

35:54.090 --> 35:56.372
My old buddies had gone home I was really ready when 
that pole was lifted on me you bet did you entertain

35:57.145 --> 36:23.322
any thoughts of now getting out of the military and 
moving into banking well at this point I decided I

35:57.145 --> 36:23.322
was going to stay in the army and I guess the reason 
well uh I guess that uh It gets in your blood. That's

36:27.167 --> 36:28.268
one thing to say about it. Matter of fact, when I 
came back to A&M after the war on the staff, I saw

36:28.308 --> 36:34.173
many of my classmates over the course of three 
years. You know, they're coming back for football

36:34.534 --> 36:54.372
games or visits or whatever, and you'd be amazed 
how many of them who had, of course, served in the

36:34.534 --> 36:54.372
war and gotten out, whether they really would have 
done it or not, would say, gosh, I wish I'd stayed in

36:34.534 --> 36:54.372
the Army, which is simply evidence that it did get 
in their blood. but by this time I felt that it was a

36:55.313 --> 37:23.582
fine profession and I guess it's fair to say that 
you don't really experience

36:55.313 --> 37:23.582
the complete dedication of men to their task and 
the effectiveness of men that'll match what you

36:55.313 --> 37:23.582
see in wartime oh yeah it's a matter of life and 
death and I don't know I guess you I kind of felt that

37:25.553 --> 37:28.135
I'd kind of like to stay in an outfit that could 
demonstrate that. That was a part of it. So I never

37:32.979 --> 37:39.505
really, well, as I say, it just gets in your blood 
and you become a part of it. Were you married at the

37:40.426 --> 37:41.547
time? No, I was not. I married some years after the 
war. Married in 49.

37:50.334 --> 37:55.138
So I just kind of, without having to debate it, 
decided I'd stay in. I had the regular commission

37:57.228 --> 38:24.147
of course had been conscious that I was in the Army 
it wasn't a matter of staying in it was a matter of

37:57.228 --> 38:24.147
whether I got out or not whether I resigned or not 
not whether I'd be dismissed right because you had

37:57.228 --> 38:24.147
a regular commission a reserve commission so you 
came home in January of 1946 and became the staff

37:57.228 --> 38:24.147
officer of the field artillery school for the next 
six months Yes. Tell me about that. That was very

38:26.784 --> 38:27.885
interesting. You know, I told you I never had a bad 
job in the Army, but I hardly had a job at Fort Sill.

38:34.195 --> 38:36.077
Sure, that only lasted for six months. Because the 
fact was that the Army was demobilizing, and

38:36.098 --> 38:44.530
officers were arriving home from overseas faster 
than they could be placed in an assignment. So I was

38:46.813 --> 38:50.539
at Fort Sill really just being given, you might 
say... temporary jobs to do until they could find a

38:52.291 --> 39:20.830
permanent assignment for them which resulted in 
my being sent to Washington you might you see there

38:52.291 --> 39:20.830
after uh so you went to Washington in June of 46 but 
you only stayed there as the assistant G3

38:52.291 --> 39:20.830
headquarters army ground forces for three months 
until October 46 yeah was that another situation

38:52.291 --> 39:20.830
in which they were waiting for you to are waiting to 
find a opening for a colonel no uh I felt very

39:22.784 --> 39:38.468
fortunate to be assigned to that position and it 
was at a level that I'd never served at before and it

39:22.784 --> 39:38.468
was in Washington in the Pentagon but President 
Gib Gilchrist of Texas A&M came to Washington and

39:22.784 --> 39:38.468
said I want you to come to A&M. He did. And he said I'm 
up here to get you released from this job That's the

39:46.949 --> 39:49.212
president, Ann Emerson? Yes, indeed. He came to 
Washington just to get you? No, not just to get me,

39:51.695 --> 39:58.244
but he was in Washington on business, and he came to 
see me and told me that. Of course, I had known him

39:59.405 --> 40:01.568
well as a cadet. He was dean of the School of 
Engineering when I was at A&M. And what he was

40:07.576 --> 40:10.540
doing, and he succeeded. I agreed, and he 
succeeded in getting me released. what he was

40:16.767 --> 40:43.348
doing was realizing that A&M's cadet corps had to 
be rebuilt because after my class was ordered to

40:16.767 --> 40:43.348
active duty on graduation and then the next 
classes were they just simply didn't wait for

40:16.767 --> 40:43.348
graduation they just take them out of the classes 
and draft them sure or order them to duty if they

40:16.767 --> 40:43.348
were to the officer school or many of them went to 
officer school of course that were juniors or

40:43.565 --> 40:44.946
seniors. I don't recall in detail how that 
happened. But anyway, the Cadet Corps at A&M was

40:48.390 --> 40:58.860
basically of youngsters who were too young to be 
called or who had physical defects. And it really

40:58.880 --> 41:11.192
must have been very disruptive, to say the least, 
of the Cadet Corps functioning and perpetuation.

41:11.594 --> 41:33.707
President Gilchrist, with his staff, and I'm sure 
the military staff, attempted to find specific

41:11.594 --> 41:33.707
former students that could come in and join the 
military staff and help speed the rebuilding of

41:11.594 --> 41:33.707
that cadet corps, which was a very satisfying 
mission. Well, let's talk about that because it

41:34.688 --> 41:40.116
lasted for three years, from October 46 until 
September 49. you're a full colonel and you were

41:40.720 --> 42:10.390
made instructor of tactics I was a lieutenant 
colonel oh you were a lieutenant colonel yes well

41:40.720 --> 42:10.390
of course the primary duty there is the 
instructor's duty

41:40.720 --> 42:10.390
I was an instructor of field artillery in the 
military staff but the

41:40.720 --> 42:10.390
special duty you might say was the emphasis to 
guide that cadet corps rebuilding properly. And I

42:14.214 --> 42:40.022
think some of the things that were done that are of 
interest is

42:14.214 --> 42:40.022
that

42:14.214 --> 42:40.022
in addition to the old method of having the active 
duty military officers there act as tactical

42:14.214 --> 42:40.022
officers and advisors to the cadet commanders, we 
had some special things that we tried to do. be very

42:41.082 --> 42:44.427
familiar now with the Ross Volunteer 
Organization. The charter for the Ross

42:46.570 --> 42:58.306
Volunteers was rewritten to make it more a 
military and ceremonial unit and less a social

42:46.570 --> 42:58.306
unit. It really functioned as much as a social unit 
in its earlier form. And I think we can be very proud

43:05.216 --> 43:09.422
of the Ross Volunteers. We always were, but I think 
they're They're on a very fine and permanent

43:13.195 --> 43:15.838
basis. Now, would you not agree? And of course, we 
tried to get the matter of discipline and hazing in

43:20.102 --> 43:25.947
focus. And of course, hazing is a, you have to let 
those cadet officers run their outfits. There's

43:33.575 --> 43:35.176
no other way. And the only influence that that 
staff can influence is through some leadership

43:35.997 --> 43:43.084
and guidance. and gaining the confidence of those 
young people.

43:48.938 --> 43:50.500
And so a special effort was made. We had a very fine 
commandant there, General Guy S. Malloy, that

43:50.560 --> 43:57.729
many people remember. He was succeeded by General 
Hayden S. Bolton. They were both colonels at the

44:00.251 --> 44:01.653
time. General Malloy later became a four-star 
general. General Bolton became a two-star

44:06.799 --> 44:08.501
general. General Bolton, I think, was a great 
favorite former students because he went around

44:12.292 --> 44:21.084
talking to a lot of A&M clubs and he was a very 
colorful character anyway. But for this critical

44:21.805 --> 44:24.949
period it was Colonel Malloy, General Malloy.

44:27.673 --> 44:38.849
The President did direct some major changes in the 
policies regarding

44:27.673 --> 44:38.849
particularly hazing that affected the Corps. Of 
course, we were still all military at this time.

44:44.101 --> 44:50.668
And this was a very bitter pill for the cadet 
commanders. They felt that not only had tradition

44:50.688 --> 44:59.817
as they knew it been disturbed, but that some of 
their authority had been taken away from them. And

45:01.598 --> 45:03.300
we had a very serious situation there. As a matter 
of fact,

45:03.320 --> 45:13.230
the cadet officers marched to President 
Gilchrist's residence. and resigned

45:14.273 --> 45:18.258
en masse. And

45:19.981 --> 45:26.209
Colonel Malloy, this was a very serious thing. 
Absolutely. After a few days, and it seemed that

45:29.393 --> 45:34.119
this... What was your opinion of this move? Well, 
I'll describe that. But Colonel Malloy, having,

45:35.922 --> 45:43.572
after a few days and just a day, seeing that this was 
serious and that they meant it and so forth, I think

45:44.328 --> 46:12.951
we had an inspector general on his way from 
Washington very quickly and from a

45:44.328 --> 46:12.951
representative from Fort Sam Houston

45:44.328 --> 46:12.951
so of course Colonel Malloy instructed these 
young men to return and pick up their commissions

45:44.328 --> 46:12.951
and they didn't so what was at stake here all of 
those fellas most of those fellows were under

46:13.336 --> 46:20.285
contract with the U.S. government, the U.S. Army, 
for advanced ROTC. Well, the ultimate outcome of

46:21.586 --> 46:28.315
this could be that A&M would lose its ROTC unit. It 
could. Sure. And looking at it in the most serious

46:31.579 --> 46:35.464
light. So, of course,

46:35.484 --> 46:41.672
we were all very concerned about it.

46:43.340 --> 47:11.912
I don't know that this really had much to do with it, 
but

46:43.340 --> 47:11.912
about three of us former student officers on duty 
with the military department got Colonel

46:43.340 --> 47:11.912
Malloy's concurrence to allow us to attempt to 
assemble these cadet officers and talk some

46:43.340 --> 47:11.912
straightforward about the

46:43.340 --> 47:11.912
gravity of the situation as far as the Army was 
concerned.
