WEBVTT

00:07.456 --> 00:18.108
The big student organizations when you were here, 
the big student organizations, the band, what

00:07.456 --> 00:18.108
else were notable? Had the Royal Volunteers and 
the band. The only thing I recall that we had other

00:24.235 --> 00:30.081
than cadet units. The student leaders that 
everyone respected and admired, Corps

00:30.161 --> 00:36.028
Commander, who else? Well, regimental 
commanders were highly respected. General Ray

00:41.118 --> 00:46.285
Murray was my senior regimental commander. I was 
on his staff, and most of the Marine

00:46.445 --> 01:00.244
generals that we had, we had four or five, had 
prominent jobs. The cadet colonel was, went

01:03.262 --> 01:13.474
direct to the Marines, but never did get past the 
promotion, past the full colonel. But the other

01:14.415 --> 01:22.445
four of my class were two-star generals.

01:24.067 --> 01:28.172
Mayor General Holtmuth was killed in a air crash in 
Vietnam.

01:34.786 --> 01:38.412
There wasn't even a student body president then in 
those days, was there? He had a president of each

01:38.812 --> 01:40.395
class. That's what I thought. But if you could have 
had any student leadership position on the

01:41.737 --> 01:50.852
campus, would the highest prestige have gone to 
the corps commander? Well, the opinion of most

01:52.368 --> 02:07.064
cadets during my day, your highest job as far as 
prestige was being a unit commander. Oh,

02:07.304 --> 02:11.188
okay. Now, whether a guy had a choice of being a unit 
commander or a corps commander, it might vary with

02:11.208 --> 02:19.337
the individual, but that was the That was 
everybody's ambition, to be the unit commander.

02:25.590 --> 02:37.393
We had a young fellow that was our senior cadet 
commander that was born and raised in

02:38.757 --> 02:46.934
80 miles south of Douglas, Arizona in Mexico, 
where his dad was a superintendent of a copper

02:38.757 --> 02:46.934
mine. And he was educated in Douglas, Arizona. I 
visited with him one summer.

02:56.915 --> 03:12.797
He was our senior cadet commander and was killed in 
an airplane crash and was not in the service, but he

02:56.915 --> 03:12.797
was with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Hoof 
and Mouth Program. And he and his roommate roomed

03:13.942 --> 03:23.632
together four years, and they're the only two 
people I knew that lived together four years. And

03:24.333 --> 03:28.337
they met in a depot in Houston. One comes from 
Douglas, Arizona, and the other one comes from

03:28.357 --> 03:31.520
Louisiana. And they met in Houston to catch a train 
coming up here. They said since both of us are

03:36.726 --> 03:42.632
foreigners, let's room together and stay 
together four years. And we're still real close to

03:42.612 --> 03:50.046
the family from Louisiana because they were in the 
rice business, and they're both gone. Their

03:50.487 --> 03:55.416
daughter and granddaughter were here about three 
weeks ago, spent the weekend with us. Did you ever

03:56.718 --> 03:57.820
hitchhike? Very little. Didn't hitchhike much 
because they didn't have anywhere to go because

04:00.492 --> 04:13.345
it's too far to hitchhike back to Crockett because 
until they built the first river bridge about the

04:00.492 --> 04:13.345
beginning of my senior year, it wasn't good to 
hitchhike toward the ferry. You had to go from here

04:19.229 --> 04:26.457
to Rowan's Prairie and Huntsville and Riverside 
and Trinity to hitchhike, see, to go around. In

04:27.277 --> 04:36.227
fact, on several occasions, when that river, you 
could not cross the ferry boat, that's the way I had

04:27.277 --> 04:36.227
to go home. Didn't go home but twice a year, 
usually. Sometimes I'd go home on the RV holidays.

04:45.330 --> 04:48.034
It's entirely different now from what it was then. 
Can you describe a court trip during your

04:48.695 --> 04:53.802
undergraduate days? Yes, we had two court trips my 
freshman year. I think the official one was to

05:00.092 --> 05:03.897
Shreveport, Louisiana. We were playing 
centenary, and I believe That was the official

05:07.983 --> 05:27.635
court trip, and I think there was enough people in 
one year, in my freshman year, that we had an

05:07.983 --> 05:27.635
unofficial to the Thanksgiving game in Austin, 
and even paraded, and it was not recognized as an

05:07.983 --> 05:27.635
official trip. In fact, I have a picture 
somewhere. How did you get to Austin? Probably

05:34.358 --> 05:35.820
cars. So you crowded in? And some hitchhiking. All 
right. To Shreveport, do you remember how you got

05:38.783 --> 05:40.606
there? On a train. They run a special train. 
Where'd you spend the night? On the train. Oh, on

05:48.295 --> 05:48.796
the train. Spent the night on the train going and on 
the night coming back. All right. In your other

05:53.542 --> 06:00.871
three years, court trips to Dallas or Fort Worth, 
were there any Tessies that came to the game? Any

06:02.112 --> 06:04.315
girls from TSCW? Yes, there was a few 
acquaintances every year from TCU and SMU, TSCW,

06:04.700 --> 06:22.286
but not as full scale as it is now. Now, the fact that 
you were a student here, did that help you to meet

06:22.306 --> 06:26.472
this young lady? Well, I met her on a blind date 
because a gentleman worked at the post office with

06:27.802 --> 06:41.529
Tiger Teague that was her brother-in-law. No, 
Tiger Teague and Robert worked together. Yeah,

06:46.959 --> 06:50.586
but he was married to your sister. Freddie Teague 
and my sister were just like that. I see. And I came

06:56.400 --> 06:58.924
to visit my sister here. During the summer when I 
was trying to catch up with my lost scalpels. And we

07:04.833 --> 07:09.760
went on a picnic, the Brightest River, and that's 
how we met. Now, she mentioned going on a picnic.

07:15.808 --> 07:18.953
Where did you students go for a good time? While you 
were undergraduate? I don't recall any place.

07:23.232 --> 07:23.612
Now, wait. Don't tell me y'all never went out on a 
Saturday night. Well, now, there were a few that

07:26.496 --> 07:30.442
were addicted to hard liquors. I say a few. There 
wasn't as many as there would be now. Now, describe

07:37.011 --> 07:38.012
that. It was located on the Welborn Road about 
where? About where Holloman Street comes out. And

07:46.355 --> 07:50.560
Mr. Hardlicker is H-Y-R-D... I'm not sure. I 
presume it's a Czech name. Yeah. And he served beer

07:54.585 --> 07:56.887
legally. Legally. And was that, he didn't serve 
whiskey, did he? No. And did they also have food?

08:05.077 --> 08:06.619
Could you get a hamburger or a hot dog? I think they 
had a little miscellaneous food. Probably would

08:11.284 --> 08:12.666
have seated how many? Oh, probably 25 or 30 at a 
time. But if it was a Saturday night and things were

08:17.535 --> 08:23.388
loose enough, half of them were outside. But I was 
never one of their patrons. In your day, did

08:28.739 --> 08:33.169
students also go to what later would be called 
Whiskey Bridge? No, a few people that had cars

08:34.246 --> 08:43.517
might have gone out there, but I don't know whether 
Whiskey Bridge was there when I was a student. I

08:44.177 --> 08:45.839
believe that was after my time. What was there in 
Bryan that a student would go to enjoy? Movies.

08:53.588 --> 08:54.870
Movies was about the only thing. And a rare date. 
And we had this trolley run from about where the

08:58.563 --> 09:12.865
Capitol into Bryan. Ran maybe every 30 minutes. 
Did it run along parallel to the railroad?

09:18.915 --> 09:19.796
Remember what it cost? No. Very, very nominal. And 
people would go over the weekend probably to see a

09:24.271 --> 09:30.781
movie and a few were fortunate enough to have 
dates. Queen Theater and the Palace were the two of

09:32.463 --> 09:36.349
the big ones in those days. Was there a place, let's 
make believe that you had a date and you wanted to go

09:37.010 --> 09:43.239
eat at a fancy place. Where would that have been? I 
don't recall any at this time. I'm not gonna say

09:52.327 --> 09:57.003
there wasn't any, but I didn't have that occasion. 
The project houses that Dan Russell had helped

09:57.766 --> 10:04.851
create, they were in full No,

10:05.877 --> 10:10.782
that was after my time. Is that right? Now, the 
students from Houston County had their own

10:11.423 --> 10:19.311
project house where I left my car for a while. But 
that wasn't on the campus. I don't believe the

10:20.853 --> 10:25.558
project house was built when I was here as a 
student. It was soon after that. And I knew Dan

10:28.060 --> 10:34.467
Russell very, very well because he was born and 
raised in my county. Talk about him a minute.

10:36.902 --> 10:37.663
Describe him. We don't have anything yet in the 
file about Dan Russell. Well, he was a fine

10:40.428 --> 10:47.941
Christian gentleman and would help anybody any 
way he could. In fact, I expect he passed more

10:48.963 --> 10:58.800
people in real sociology that didn't deserve a 
passing grade than the ones he passed legally.

10:58.780 --> 11:02.368
Because am I correct that his nickname was Dr. Dan 
the Grade Point Man? Grade Point Man was his

11:02.388 --> 11:07.499
nickname, but he was a great gentleman. Why did he 
grade, why did he not flunk more? Why did he grade

11:10.505 --> 11:13.191
easy? I feel like at He knew that most of their 
courses were very difficult, and if they could

11:15.892 --> 11:31.729
listen to his lectures for a semester, that they 
got enough out of the course to get a passing grade.

11:31.789 --> 11:33.751
That's the best answer I can give you. But he was a 
great gentleman. But the project house was a

11:35.994 --> 11:39.998
project of his. All right, then the residential 
area. south of the campus was still quite small?

11:48.477 --> 11:59.269
Well, it would be probably

11:48.477 --> 11:59.269
from George Bush Drive to Park Place would be about 
it. Herschel Burgess developed most of that. And

12:03.133 --> 12:07.197
many, many of the faculty and staff lived on 
campus. That's right. And I understand from Rusty

12:09.159 --> 12:14.164
and

12:16.304 --> 12:25.035
Henry Gilchrist, that the A&M consolidated 
schools all did their instruction on campus until

12:16.304 --> 12:25.035
I believe 1937. I don't know when the change was 
made, but the high school was across the street

12:25.796 --> 12:41.316
from a confectionery called George 
McCullough's, about where Dormitory 2 is now.

12:42.224 --> 12:45.248
That was the high school. In fact, they taught some 
classes in old Pfeiffer Hall. Now, you college

12:50.213 --> 12:57.322
students didn't have any interaction with the 
high school students much at all. No. Now, would it

12:57.422 --> 13:03.709
have been acceptable for an Aggie undergraduate 
to have dated a named and consolidated girl? I

13:04.178 --> 13:06.482
think it had been left up to her parents. Oh, okay. 
Y'all wouldn't have made fun of him if he did. No, I

13:10.870 --> 13:11.792
don't think so. No, they were short of space over 
there, and Pfeiffer Hall had been condemned. And

13:20.167 --> 13:25.917
the engineers went there and put some rods about 
three-quarters of an inch on two horizontal and

13:25.897 --> 13:36.588
four crossways

13:25.897 --> 13:36.588
with flanges on the outside and made it safe. And 
they had classes in there, I think, until they

13:37.389 --> 13:42.054
built their first high school. In fact, I've 
helped a number of sessions on early school

13:43.115 --> 13:52.005
history and early residential here for the city 
college station. They're trying to put a book

13:54.128 --> 13:56.831
together on the whole thing. In fact, I carried a 
piece of one of those dials, one of those rods up to

13:57.852 --> 14:08.866
one of the meetings and told them what it was for, 
but there was nobody in the group that could spell

13:57.852 --> 14:08.866
Pfeiffer. P-F, I think it is, isn't it? I don't 
remember. I think it's P-F-E-I-F-F, I believe,

14:12.450 --> 14:15.755
but I'm not sure. Now, the Depression was in full 
swing by the time you were getting out of school,

14:22.698 --> 14:32.810
what did you think you were going to be doing with 
the rest of your life when you left, when you got

14:22.698 --> 14:32.810
ready to leave A&M? Well, my classroom work 
qualified me as a teacher of vocational subjects.

14:40.520 --> 14:48.269
And I thought if I could mix that with a coaching job 
that I'd be working with people and do a lot of good.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.114
And I got my first job During the RV holidays, the 
president of the A&M band was a friend of mine. And

15:02.472 --> 15:09.402
he lived in Luling, Texas, and he said, you got a job 
yet? And I said, no. He said, my school, high

15:10.323 --> 15:17.453
school's got an opening, and my mother's on the 
school board. Why don't you take your RV holidays

15:18.194 --> 15:21.959
and go home with me? So I did, and got my first job at 
Luling. They did not have a shop, but they were in

15:26.924 --> 15:31.335
the process of trying to put in a shop. They did not 
have a basketball team, but I had a full-time

15:31.436 --> 15:38.554
assignment three times a week officiating 
basketball. from the nearby town. And when the

15:41.693 --> 15:48.644
superintendent and principal interviewed me for 
the job, they said, what are you qualified to

15:41.693 --> 15:48.644
teach? And I said, I've got chemistry, I've got a 
minor in chemistry, and my major is vocational

15:48.684 --> 15:55.334
work. But if you give me a book and a weak start, I'll 
teach anything in the building. And I think that's

16:01.785 --> 16:03.968
what hired me. So you did get hired at Luling. Yeah, 
hired at Luling. Do you remember what the salary

16:07.548 --> 16:09.216
was? I believe it was $250 a month. Because I left 
there after one year to go to Isleta. It's now in the

16:19.895 --> 16:22.618
El Paso District. And it was a much better job, and I 
was assured a basketball coaching job. But the

16:34.135 --> 16:44.029
best story about my job was probably the one I got 
here, which you probably want to tie that to you. my

16:44.009 --> 16:46.373
staff job, how I got it. Yeah, let's hold on to that a 
second. Hold on, next time. Let's see, back to

16:50.079 --> 16:58.433
student days, did students try to smuggle alcohol 
into the dormitory in those days? I don't recall

16:58.774 --> 16:59.916
it. All right, what about smoking? Who smoked? I 
don't think there's any borderline on smoking. I

17:06.006 --> 17:06.727
don't remember. Did the average student smoke? 
No. I don't believe that every student smoked. But

17:15.519 --> 17:18.207
students were allowed to smoke in their room if 
they wanted to? I think so. They probably couldn't

17:19.751 --> 17:21.015
afford it. If you didn't like smoke, just don't 
visit them. What about chewing tobacco? Did

17:27.631 --> 17:29.394
students chew? The only thing I remember about 
chewing tobacco is it made all the freshman band

17:29.714 --> 17:37.726
members chew tobacco at the first baseball game. 
Have you heard that? No. They'd go to the first part

17:41.231 --> 17:49.403
of the baseball game, and every freshman in the 
band had to chew tobacco, dip snuff. And there were

17:49.383 --> 17:55.131
about 95% of them sick when the game was over. But 
that was for the first varsity baseball game.

17:59.277 --> 18:00.119
Nothing but band. Nobody else did it.

18:04.345 --> 18:04.725
Let's see. Describe for a typical undergraduate 
at A&M then, describe a typical football game day,

18:04.805 --> 18:18.445
what happened for you for a home football game. I 
don't ever remember of a march in. If we had a march

18:22.101 --> 18:24.304
in, I don't remember. Really? Now maybe they did. 
Maybe being an athlete I might have been excused

18:26.927 --> 18:33.155
because I might not have been able to stay in step. 
But you did sit on the east side. Yeah. I mean stand,

18:37.942 --> 18:39.344
excuse me, stand. Yeah. And the lower level is all 
we had. And y'all did kiss your dates. Yeah. And did

18:47.213 --> 18:50.736
the yell leaders dress then about like they do now? 
I think so. And the yells had signals? Yells had

18:55.081 --> 18:58.163
signals and no megaphones. And about the only 
thing I recall ever forming was a blocked T. I don't

18:59.164 --> 19:08.954
think there's any other formation ever 
attempted. What about some of the ritual events?

19:15.040 --> 19:16.461
Did you help with bonfire? Yes, bonfires were all 
together different. Bonfire in my day was a

19:20.203 --> 19:26.516
cleanup for Brazos County. They would call in the 
Commandant's Office if somebody had an old wooden

19:26.536 --> 19:33.410
building to tear down or something that would 
burn. And in most cases, there was not a green log on

19:34.252 --> 19:38.500
it. Were there some logs at all? If there were, they 
were probably dead and hauled in with this other

19:41.295 --> 19:45.378
stuff. But people knew that, and they'd call in, 
take the calls at the communist office, and they'd

19:45.939 --> 20:01.492
go out and get the stuff and had probably as big a 
fire, but not as hot and not as long and not as high.

20:02.193 --> 20:03.634
Was it on the drill field? Yeah. Was there a privy 
usually on top of it? Yeah. And that, quite often,

20:09.057 --> 20:12.162
was a real privy, wasn't it? Yeah, and got somebody 
in trouble. That's the reason they started making

20:14.866 --> 20:16.449
them. Did you all do silver taps? Yeah. Where was it 
held? It was held at Soros Monument, with the

20:22.038 --> 20:29.349
buglers on the top of the academic building. Do you 
remember your feelings when you went to your first

20:29.830 --> 20:34.958
silver taps, or any of the other? No.

20:38.622 --> 20:42.708
I don't believe it would be any different than it 
would now, but it was different. Do you remember

20:44.331 --> 20:50.621
any time going to Silver Taps for a close friend 
while you were a student? No, I don't believe I do.

20:53.205 --> 20:55.568
But it still meant the same. Was there muster in 
those days? Aggie muster? I believe so. Do you

21:01.437 --> 21:02.579
remember where it was held? No, I don't remember 
where it was held. Do you remember Final Review?

21:08.571 --> 21:09.272
Yeah. Final Review is about the same as it is now. 
We're changing command and going around twice,

21:13.900 --> 21:21.994
and most of the seniors had their next year's gear 
in Long Prairie Hall, and that's as far as they had

21:23.240 --> 21:31.208
to go to change it. So I remember that, remember 
them well, especially my last one, because I went

21:32.509 --> 21:46.884
from final review to active duty the next morning 
at Fort Sam Houston. I had asked for two weeks tour

21:46.904 --> 21:53.010
to get that out of the way before I got a job. Then my 
correspondence after two years, he could be a

21:52.990 --> 21:58.707
first lieutenant. By doing that, I was a first 
lieutenant when I was called before Pearl Harbor.

22:05.727 --> 22:07.793
By virtue of getting that first military 
assignment, which is something they don't have

22:08.937 --> 22:23.802
anymore, CMTC, Citizen Military Training Camp, 
out at Bullis, where I had been the summer before

22:08.937 --> 22:23.802
for junior camp, went to Bullis. Now, I'm assuming 
that when you were an undergraduate, you and your

22:23.822 --> 22:29.832
buddies did not expect something like World War 
II, that that was... No. That was the least of

22:34.748 --> 22:37.012
anybody's mind. And the Depression, I presume, 
was the big concern and worry. Well, because I was

22:42.062 --> 22:46.210
here in school during part of the Depression. We 
have even a lot of our graduates have never given

22:46.230 --> 22:54.165
more than $15, $20, $30 during their lifetime.

22:56.693 --> 23:21.688
I'm not supposed to know that, but every 
silver-taps notice I get shows the total amount

22:56.693 --> 23:21.688
that they donated to A&M since they graduated, and 
it's alarming, because it was during the

22:56.693 --> 23:21.688
Depression, and a lot of people didn't even join 
the association at the minimum low.

23:24.048 --> 23:28.376
How much did, do you remember how much your ring 
cost? No, I don't remember. It wasn't much. I still

23:31.282 --> 23:37.033
have somewhere, it might be in my annual, I still 
have a receipt for my ring. I'm telling you it's a

23:37.053 --> 23:40.320
far cry from what it is now. Do you have any ring 
stories to share? Did you ever lose it or? No.

23:45.310 --> 23:46.512
Nothing like that? No, the only ring story I could 
tell would be something that happened at the Iwo

23:47.217 --> 23:56.493
Jima, if you'd like me to tell you. Oh, yes. I helped 
organize the Aggie muster on Iwo Jima because

23:57.535 --> 24:04.347
things had settled down enough. Must be 45. Yeah, 
that we were just mopping up and cleaning up behind

24:05.813 --> 24:14.303
the Marines, and I was with a regimental combat 
team. And there was a Navy commander there in

24:15.684 --> 24:24.814
charge of all the construction people, a 27 A&M 
graduate. And he's the only person that had a

24:25.956 --> 24:31.602
dining hall big enough to get 40 people in. We 
didn't have 40 for mustard, but every Aggie except

24:32.459 --> 24:43.794
two, and they were on fighter duty that night, 
mustered in his dining hall. And before the eating

24:45.457 --> 24:54.869
meals started, his dining hall was about 150 yards 
from the coast. And everybody was changing vids

24:56.231 --> 24:59.776
and stories. A lot of people we'd never even met. on 
a sandbar out close to the water, probably 25 or 30

25:03.003 --> 25:08.912
of us. And we noticed a destroyer come over the 
hump, a small boat. It might have been something

25:14.300 --> 25:16.744
smaller than a destroyer. And they had sunk some 
small boats in the form of a U, trying to make a

25:17.566 --> 25:24.336
little harbor. and the tugboat or whatever it was, 
I believe it was a tugboat, come up close enough

25:25.480 --> 25:44.805
that a man jumped off of the tugboat up on these 
boats that they salvaged in the water and come out

25:25.480 --> 25:44.805
right in front of us. I think we had a little A&M flag 
stuck in the sand. And he said, is this an A&M

25:50.170 --> 25:53.173
gathering? And I said, yes. And he said, well, I'm 
sure glad to see civilization, especially Aggie.

26:01.762 --> 26:12.092
He had on his Aggie ring, and he parachuted into the 
Gulf from a plane the night before, and his tugboat

26:01.762 --> 26:12.092
had picked him up. And then you can talk about one 
proud person. And I'm sorry I didn't follow up on

26:15.776 --> 26:24.306
the story, because it would have been a good story 
for Cooper if I could have remembered who he was.

26:25.267 --> 26:31.074
But I have the original roster of everybody that 
was at that muster. I kind of have the impression

26:31.714 --> 26:41.185
now that World War II made muster more important as 
an Aggie tradition than it actually was.

26:41.536 --> 26:42.638
Absolutely. Because now it certainly is a key. As 
you were getting ready to leave the campus, what

26:46.303 --> 26:58.681
kind of world did you think you were going to be 
entering, working in? Well, I had this job at

27:00.042 --> 27:08.134
Luling as a teacher, but not coaching because they 
didn't have a basketball team. I could see myself

27:09.143 --> 27:19.624
as a high school teacher, but I didn't know whether 
they were beyond Luling or not, and I just stayed

27:09.143 --> 27:19.624
there a year. Did you feel that A&M had prepared you 
pretty well? I sure did. I felt like, and I've so

27:24.183 --> 27:34.801
stated that in an article in the June, Texas Aggie, 
have you read that story? Yes, sir. I just felt like

27:36.945 --> 27:42.314
I needed to give something back for the future. And 
I had this property and it was put together and

27:46.842 --> 28:07.341
willed to me by a World War I Navy veteran, and I have 
a cadet scholarship coming up for him, and I have a

27:46.842 --> 28:07.341
Dairy Science scholarship coming up in memory of 
my brother, because he was a Dairy Science student

27:46.842 --> 28:07.341
and was on the National Jerry Judging Team his 
senior year. And the rest of my A&M's half of the

28:08.342 --> 28:13.407
money goes to Opportunity Award Scholarship. the 
Consolidated School, because both of my children

28:14.095 --> 28:22.178
are over there, and my high school in Crockett, and 
hers in McClellan County in Moody. And any others

28:23.040 --> 28:29.117
that can be added will go back to here, maybe a rural 
school. We've got four rural high schools in

28:31.539 --> 28:35.644
Houston County. But that's pretty well. And I went 
to my church with the understanding that the doors

28:39.287 --> 28:46.514
would all be wide open in the future. I didn't know 
whether you'd seen that story or not.

28:52.560 --> 28:52.741
Yes, sir. What key qualities do you think A&M put 
into you. What is it that Aggies learn, develop? If

29:07.030 --> 29:09.232
they didn't learn it, they should have. Whatever 
you do, do it well, or a little better. And

29:15.759 --> 29:22.706
appreciate everything that you do for yourself 
and your fellow man, and everything they do for

29:15.759 --> 29:22.706
you. Be friendly, make friends, and contribute to 
your community. And I think athletics helped me,

29:28.852 --> 29:43.010
and my military training here helped me more 
toward that goal. What are the events

29:43.571 --> 29:52.783
in an undergraduate Aggies experience that helps 
to create this spirit? I think hometown clubs and

29:53.573 --> 29:59.722
clubs for your major. See, we had a Houston County 
A&M club. We had an industrial arts club. The Tea

30:05.331 --> 30:09.157
Association was a very, very active club. And the 
students now don't care much about the Tea

30:10.619 --> 30:15.827
Association. We can't even get it started. But RVs 
was a respected organization,

30:18.751 --> 30:44.742
but their routine now is entirely different from 
what it was when we got RV holidays before because

30:18.751 --> 30:44.742
it was something you wouldn't be proud of. the way 
they spent their three days in the early 30s, if you

30:44.722 --> 30:51.814
understand what I mean. But what about such 
activities as bonfire and taps and midnight yell

30:53.577 --> 31:01.370
practice? Are those important? Yes, I think 
they're all important because it gives you unity.

31:07.258 --> 31:22.862
And I think community projects, cleaning up 
Brazos County from river to river and building the

31:07.258 --> 31:22.862
bonfire, I think means more to the community then 
than it does now. Because everybody saved their

31:22.882 --> 31:29.933
old lumber, old buildings, and it was just, it 
didn't
