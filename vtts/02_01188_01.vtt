00:03.170 --> 00:16.282
Okay,

00:03.170 --> 00:16.282
this is Ron Shorn on Tuesday, June 1st, 1993, at the 
University of Texas at Austin Astronomy

00:03.170 --> 00:16.282
Department. And, well, to start off, why don't you 
introduce yourself, give your full name. Okay, my

00:21.807 --> 00:24.670
name is William Hamilton Jeffries. Actually, I'm 
the third in that line that bears that name. And I'm

00:31.165 --> 00:36.913
the Harlan J. Smith Professor of Astronomy, 
Centennial Professor of Astronomy at the

00:31.165 --> 00:36.913
University of Texas. OK. Just for the record, when 
were you born and where? OK. Born 1940, July 8, New

00:41.821 --> 00:47.048
Bedford, Massachusetts. OK. And when did you 
first get interested in astronomy? Oh, when I was

00:50.473 --> 00:53.879
quite young, probably around 10 or 11. What was the 
thing? Was there a thing? Well, there were a couple

00:57.123 --> 01:00.328
of incidents. My father, who is and was, of course, 
at the time a clergyman, always was interested in

01:00.933 --> 01:17.533
science, had taught at the Episcopal Academy 
outside Philadelphia, where he had also gone to

01:00.933 --> 01:17.533
school. And he was the chaplain there for a few 
years during the war, Second World War, for those

01:18.815 --> 01:29.067
of us that remember that sort of thing. And there 
was a colleague of his named Bob Nethery,

01:30.481 --> 01:47.339
N-E-A-T-H-E-R-Y, who was one of the science 
teachers at that school and who also moonlighted

01:30.481 --> 01:47.339
as a planetarium lecturer at the Fels Planetarium 
in Philadelphia. And one day, I recall, I was just

01:48.560 --> 01:55.948
thinking about this a few months ago, in fact, that 
my father took me to see the planetarium show, and

01:56.553 --> 02:09.144
he introduced me to his friend Bob Mithery after 
the show, who then proceeded to show me how the

01:56.553 --> 02:09.144
planetarium projector worked, which was quite 
impressive for me at that age. So that was one of the

02:10.064 --> 02:11.305
things. The other thing was that somebody, and I 
don't recall who it was, gave me a book on astronomy

02:12.446 --> 02:21.754
as a birthday present or a Christmas present. And 
so I read it through and found it fascinating.

02:27.738 --> 02:37.169
about the time that I decided that astronomy was 
pretty interesting stuff, although I didn't

02:27.738 --> 02:37.169
actually make up my mind to become an astronomer 
until probably mid-teens. Where'd you go to

02:37.889 --> 02:39.431
undergrad school? I went to Wesleyan University 
in Connecticut,

02:39.451 --> 02:56.310
worked for Charlie Gasteyer, who is now dead, 
measuring plates, and

02:39.451 --> 02:56.310
Leo Stern, I guess it was. Sterns? Was it Leo? Was 
the director of the observatory, or was at the

03:00.707 --> 03:04.612
observatory. And I actually came the year that 
Thornton Page joined the faculty at Wesleyan as

03:04.632 --> 03:15.985
the director of the observatory. What year was 
that? That was 1958. What was your major? I majored

03:20.050 --> 03:21.071
in astronomy. Took a bunch of physics. Spent a lot 
of time in the observatory. worked for Heinz

03:25.990 --> 03:27.232
Eichhorn. He got the first computer on campus, and 
we learned how to program that by reading the

03:28.895 --> 03:38.410
instruction manuals. Miles Standish was an 
undergraduate at Wesleyan during that period of

03:39.773 --> 03:50.310
time, had just graduated when that computer came, 
and he went to Westland as a graduate student for

03:50.712 --> 04:01.111
two years, took a master's degree in astronomy 
while I was finishing up my bachelor's degree, so

03:50.712 --> 04:01.111
we did this together pretty much. When did you 
graduate? Graduated in 62. Okay, and where'd you

04:04.377 --> 04:06.080
go to grad school? Went to Yale. Okay, why? Well, 
because I was interested in sort of classical

04:13.291 --> 04:14.532
aspects of astronomy. I'd done some astrometry 
for my honors paper at Wesleyan, and Heinz

04:14.572 --> 04:32.332
Eichhorn, whom I'd worked with fairly closely, 
suggested that Yale would be a good place to go, and

04:14.572 --> 04:32.332
in fact that was the only place I applied to. Good 
thing they accepted it. When did you get your

04:36.764 --> 04:38.206
Ph.D.? 65. And what was the topic of your thesis? I 
studied some dynamical systems of two degrees of

04:42.010 --> 04:49.397
freedom.

04:49.417 --> 04:50.819
Okay, then it's time to get a job. So what did you do? 
Well, to explain that, you've got to talk about

04:52.461 --> 05:00.189
Yale, because I was at Yale when Harlan was there. 
He left in 1963.

05:07.004 --> 05:10.948
Of course, therefore, my first year was the year 
that Harlan was still there. I remember the first

05:10.968 --> 05:17.696
time I saw Harlan, he had this crew cut, and he 
looked like a student. I thought he was just a

05:17.776 --> 05:19.438
graduate student. I didn't realize that he was 
about to become a director in a major observatory.

05:25.004 --> 05:35.796
And Harlan, in fact, one of the first things he did 
was to tell me that he had some there was this

05:36.282 --> 05:49.216
interesting object, 3C273, and that he had access 
to plates from the plate library at Harvard where,

05:36.282 --> 05:49.216
of course, he'd gone to school. And so he got access 
to those plates, said, you might want to measure

05:50.598 --> 06:04.213
the proper motion of this object because it's very 
strange and we don't know whether it's a galactic

05:50.598 --> 06:04.213
object or extragalactic or what. I had access to a 
plate measuring machine at Wesleyan and I

06:04.750 --> 06:33.981
measured the plates and I did photometry on the 
plates and

06:04.750 --> 06:33.981
computed the proper motion of 36273 and found that 
the proper motion was, as far as anybody could

06:04.750 --> 06:33.981
tell, zero, which was a pretty good indication 
that it wasn't too close by to us, certainly not a

06:04.750 --> 06:33.981
neutron star or something like that.

06:34.433 --> 06:47.792
Harlan then arranged for me to give a paper on this 
at the first Texas symposium on relativistic

06:34.433 --> 06:47.792
astrophysics and gravitational collapse, I 
guess it was. I gave my paper and said that I thought

06:50.096 --> 06:57.086
this object was at least such and such a number of 
parsecs away. And somebody in the audience said,

06:57.126 --> 07:01.993
how much is that in real units? Somebody else in the 
audience shouted back, three times ten to the

07:03.340 --> 07:09.187
eighteenth centimeters per parsec. Well, that 
was a number I didn't have in my head in those days,

07:09.207 --> 07:12.991
but I do now. Harlan also arranged for me to be one of 
three American students during the summer of 1963

07:14.774 --> 07:32.014
to get NATO scholarships to go to Turkey to attend a 
series of courses on mostly dynamical type

07:32.348 --> 07:39.596
subjects. George Kantopoulos was there. Sir 
Richard Woolley was there. Smart was there. He was

07:49.746 --> 07:50.968
still alive at the time. Gave lectures. I've got 
the lectures here somewhere. I don't know where.

07:55.012 --> 07:56.594
Boring writer. Oh, well, yeah. I didn't think too 
much of his lectures. Cantopoulos' lectures were

08:01.154 --> 08:03.356
very exciting. Michel Hénon was there. That was 
when he was just beginning to do his work on chaos.

08:12.384 --> 08:17.269
So it was a very worthwhile experience. The other 
two students were David Morrison, who is what now

08:18.330 --> 08:25.156
director of Ames, at Ames. Or something, yeah. 
Yeah. And Jerry Newsome. who's in Ohio somewhere,

08:30.803 --> 08:42.362
N-E-W-S-O-N-E.

08:30.803 --> 08:42.362
And the other thing that we were talking about, you 
mentioned Brian Marsden being at Yale. Brian, of

08:43.363 --> 08:55.984
course, married Nancy while he was still a student 
at Yale, decided that marriage was a pretty good

08:43.363 --> 08:55.984
thing, had a cousin, which he Nancy had a cousin 
that she thought she would like to fix up with one of

08:56.504 --> 09:04.799
the astronomers because she was kind of 
interested in astronomy, too. And I was the one

09:05.420 --> 09:12.192
that got picked, and my wife, in fact, is Nancy 
Morrison's cousin. And also,

09:12.212 --> 09:19.525
yeah, Eric Beaujean. B-O-Z-Y-A-N, Arikel, it's 
an Armenian name, who was a graduate student at

09:20.821 --> 09:26.790
Yale at the time. His sister married my second 
cousin, so there's another little connection

09:27.672 --> 09:33.601
there. Probably useless information, but there 
you are. You never know, you never know. Well, what

09:38.989 --> 09:43.656
went on with Harlem at Yale? Well, he sort of just 
was rather encouraging. I don't recall that I ever

09:48.723 --> 09:51.986
took any lectures from him. I don't think I did. But 
he was sort of an encouraging kind of a figure and

09:55.369 --> 10:04.897
encouraged me to keep at this work on 373. Clearly, 
he liked me. And I liked him. It was hard not to like.

10:15.378 --> 10:16.680
I went to their home once. They had a sort of a party 
for the graduate students. And we all sat around in

10:22.187 --> 10:31.059
the room and played various games of sorts, which 
he was very fond of, thought the family was very

10:22.187 --> 10:31.059
fond of. What was his position at the time? Was he an 
associate professor? He was an assistant

10:35.545 --> 10:39.310
professor, I think, possibly associate. I'm not 
sure about that. He did not have tenure. I guess. He

10:45.787 --> 10:47.129
would not have had tenure. That was one of the 
reasons why he came to Texas. Was he forced out of

10:49.914 --> 10:52.077
there or not? And the reason is that Art Code says 
that he wrote a very strong letter of

10:52.218 --> 11:03.477
recommendation for Harlem and wrote an even 
stronger letter back afterwards saying what

10:52.218 --> 11:03.477
fools there were to let him get away. Well, we 
graduate students, of course, weren't privy to a

11:05.099 --> 11:10.208
lot of information of that sort. The impression 
that we got, or at least that I got, was that he had

11:10.711 --> 11:32.759
not

11:10.711 --> 11:32.759
received tenure and that

11:10.711 --> 11:32.759
I know the graduate students were rather upset 
that he had left because they had a fairly good

11:10.711 --> 11:32.759
opinion of him. I heard somewhere that he almost 
took a job at the University of Virginia. I don't

11:39.668 --> 11:42.971
know anything about that. Sorry, Frederick might 
know. He's a good person to talk to. So that puts

11:48.336 --> 11:50.258
Harlan in Austin. That puts Harlan in Austin. Long 
about 1964, I kept in touch with him. He told me at

11:57.886 --> 12:09.557
the occasion of the Texas Symposium, which was 
November 1963, just after President Kennedy had

11:57.886 --> 12:09.557
been assassinated, and the worthies of Dallas 
were all worried about the image of their city,

12:09.841 --> 12:16.429
because of course that's where it was held. And 
after the meeting, he brought me down to Austin. We

12:28.082 --> 12:31.887
drove down in Frank Edmonds' old Peugeot 403. You 
remember that, don't you? And then I think that's,

12:39.507 --> 12:40.808
yeah, that's right. And then we flew out to West 
Texas, because he was trying to get Jim Douglas to

12:41.149 --> 12:47.176
come here at the time. And we flew around the 
Mitchell Flats area and saw where,

12:48.397 --> 12:56.326
was that on a different occasion? I'm not sure that 
that was that occasion or another occasion that I

12:58.128 --> 13:02.933
came to Texas. because I came here twice before I 
actually was hired. Visited Austin.

13:19.042 --> 13:25.187
I think that may have been that trip, but Jim might 
remember which two occasions it was. We sort of

13:25.247 --> 13:32.734
flew around, and then we drove out there, I guess, 
and looked at this optical flat at... this

13:32.950 --> 13:41.358
wavelength piece of land and

13:32.950 --> 13:41.358
saw the observatory. But anyway, on one of those 
occasions, Harlan said that he would like me to

13:42.159 --> 13:48.965
come here. This is before I finished my degree. And 
along in 1964, Thornton

13:52.348 --> 14:02.518
Page left about

14:03.848 --> 14:11.898
64. He left the observatory, that's right. And he 
went to Houston, I guess. I saw him in February.

14:22.150 --> 14:27.977
Because he had an accident in which he'd lost a good 
deal of the sight of one of his eyes. And I think that

14:28.017 --> 14:32.623
was difficult for him to continue at Wesleyan in 
the position that he was in. At any rate, he had

14:36.232 --> 14:38.114
left. And

14:38.715 --> 14:43.921
he was not there. And Heinz Eichhorn had gone. He 
had left also. And so there I was. They needed

14:52.993 --> 14:55.336
somebody to run the astrometry program. And so I 
ran the astrometry program during that last year

14:56.177 --> 15:02.104
when I was at Wesleyan. Harlan was afraid that I 
wouldn't finish my dissertation. He was somewhat

15:05.446 --> 15:07.308
trepidatious about it. So you were doing your 
dissertation at Yale, but you were spending most

15:07.328 --> 15:11.394
of your time at Wesleyan. A good deal of my time at 
Wesleyan. I taught a course there.

15:17.983 --> 15:20.486
But I did finish it up. And then Harlan had put my 
name in for a Sloan fellowship, which I got. And so

15:31.101 --> 15:32.563
the first year, Instead of going to Texas, I 
resigned from Yale and accepted this position as

15:32.965 --> 15:49.283
assistant professor here, but would leave for the 
first year, which was kind of an unusual

15:32.965 --> 15:49.283
arrangement. But so that I could take advantage of 
this post-doctoral fellowship and the Slum

15:49.583 --> 15:55.570
Fellowship. And what I did was I latched on to 
Juergen Moser was a mathematician at New York

16:01.568 --> 16:22.525
University at the Koran Institute, and who was one 
of the three people whose name is in the Kahn

16:01.568 --> 16:22.525
theory, the theory of the existence of

16:01.568 --> 16:22.525
toroidal solutions to dynamical systems. It's a 
very important theory these days. So, I studied

16:25.295 --> 16:26.997
with him. He was very, from my point of view, a very 
pure mathematician. Were you working on just

16:30.802 --> 16:32.764
systems in general? We were working on dynamical 
systems. When I was at NYU and also at Stanford,

16:34.606 --> 16:50.425
because he took a sabbatical at Stanford and I just 
followed him out there, we worked on a paper and

16:34.606 --> 16:50.425
published a paper on the three-body problem, in 
which we showed that certain There were solutions

16:50.827 --> 17:02.199
of the real full three-body problem that were not 
the standard triangular solutions that were

16:50.827 --> 17:02.199
stable, and we described their properties and so 
forth. I also worked on mercury. The fact that

17:06.083 --> 17:18.936
mercury rotated in 59 days had just been 
discovered, and we discussed that, and I

17:06.083 --> 17:18.936
discussed that in terms of some of Moser's work. I 
worked on some periodic... Solutions and the

17:21.320 --> 17:25.986
Restricted Problem with Miles Standish, which we 
published. And there were some other things, too.

17:27.869 --> 17:28.770
I forgot what they were. So I took the fall in New 
York City. The lights went out. Had a great time.

17:38.283 --> 17:41.288
Went out to Stanford for the spring semester. In 
this, what year was that? This was 1965, 66

17:43.931 --> 17:48.778
academic year.

17:49.906 --> 18:04.944
attended some lectures on quantum field theory 
that Sidney Drell was giving in the math

17:49.906 --> 18:04.944
department,

17:49.906 --> 18:04.944
met some famous mathematicians, and generally 
had a pretty good time. Then came here in the fall of

18:04.964 --> 18:10.210
66, just after Charles Whitten shot all those 
people off the tower. My father-in-law, we were

18:11.511 --> 18:14.875
sitting around the television set. My 
father-in-law turned to me after. Walter

18:19.336 --> 18:24.363
Cronkite came out with his news and said, Bill, 
isn't that where you're going with my daughter?

18:26.345 --> 18:29.910
Having just gotten married in 1966 in June. Now, 
since you've been here, what have you been working

18:32.013 --> 18:36.699
on in general? How's that changed? Well, first few 
years, I spent mostly working on various problems

18:37.680 --> 18:46.231
in celestial mechanics. I built... a program to 
study the surfaces of section in the restricted

18:49.711 --> 18:56.961
three-body problem. And it did some work on an 
atlas of those surfaces of section which give

18:57.221 --> 19:07.955
information about stability regimes. Got 
interested in non-numerical algebra

19:08.436 --> 19:16.326
calculations, symbolic algebra calculations, 
and wrote a processor to do that, and we used that on

19:16.846 --> 19:22.251
some dynamic systems, some satellites in 
particular. Did little observing, not a whole

19:24.373 --> 19:31.239
lot, but Darryl Mulholland was here at the time, 
Pete Shells was here at the time. Darryl and Pete

19:31.319 --> 19:41.288
sort of got involved in observing satellites of 
the outer planets, and I went out and did some of

19:31.319 --> 19:41.288
those observations. And then along 1970, Seven or 
eight, I've forgotten. Whenever the Space

19:51.673 --> 20:04.666
Telescope project got started, we proposed to the 
Space Telescope to be the astrometry team, and we

19:51.673 --> 20:04.666
got that contract. That's what I've been pretty 
much doing ever since. Haven't done so much

20:07.268 --> 20:10.651
dynamical astronomy since then. There are 
certain people that actually His name is David

20:15.858 --> 20:24.808
Dvorkin, here at the Space Museum, who claims that 
celestial mechanics isn't really astronomy.

20:24.828 --> 20:35.899
Well, I can appreciate

20:24.828 --> 20:35.899
that comment because celestial mechanics is very 
closely related to mathematics. A lot of

20:36.120 --> 20:43.047
mathematics has come out of it, but it's 
mathematics which is applied to problems

20:43.297 --> 20:49.163
planetary motion and also problems in stellar 
astronomy. It's hard to draw the line because a lot

20:49.183 --> 21:04.398
of what people have done in celestial mechanics is 
also applicable to questions in galactic

20:49.183 --> 21:04.398
structure or the structure of the rings of Saturn 
and other planetary rings and so forth. So to say

21:04.418 --> 21:11.785
that it is not astronomy at all I think is 
stretching the case but it is more mathematical in

21:12.794 --> 21:18.361
many ways than most areas of astronomy are. Well, 
I'm going to include it anyway because Simon

21:18.381 --> 21:23.688
Newcomb, after all, considered himself an 
astronomer. He certainly was not a

21:23.708 --> 21:27.433
spectroscopist. Right. Well, Brouwer 
considered the definitely astronomical area of

21:28.034 --> 21:40.190
astrometry to be the observational arm of 
celestial mechanics. That was his term for it.

21:42.494 --> 21:53.624
And, of course, Brower was responsible in large 
part for reviving celestial mechanics in this

21:42.494 --> 21:53.624
country and was pretty moribund. He came along and 
established a number of summer institutes and

21:54.745 --> 22:11.539
other opportunities for people to learn about 
celestial mechanics and established at Yale a

21:54.745 --> 22:11.539
very thriving group of people in celestial 
mechanics who are now out in the world doing their

21:54.745 --> 22:11.539
thing. Miles Standish, for example, has just 
demonstrated, fairly convincingly, that there

22:12.059 --> 22:19.008
is no Planet X. That was just within the past few 
weeks that it was announced. So, he was part of that

22:23.915 --> 22:27.560
group that was at Yale with me. You've mentioned an 
interesting point, which is that celestial

22:29.683 --> 22:39.957
mechanics was pretty dead feel in the, well even in 
the 50s and 60s. Until satellites came along.

22:41.393 --> 22:57.527
Until satellites came along, and then all of a 
sudden people realized that they had to have

22:41.393 --> 22:57.527
people that were trained in this area in order to 
support not only the civilian space program but

22:41.393 --> 22:57.527
also the military space program. Well, there was 
what? There were Brower and Clements, and who was

22:58.228 --> 22:59.949
it? Kurgut? Kurgut. And then a few people at the 
Naval Observatory. Yeah, that was pretty much it.

23:05.514 --> 23:09.758
Clements, of course, was at the Naval Observatory 
at the time and came to Yale after he retired. There

23:10.615 --> 23:21.807
was Boris Garfinkel, who's still active, at least 
it was the last time I looked.

23:23.770 --> 23:27.193
But Peter Musen, another one. You know, see, I did 
my doctoral dissertation on radiation pressure

23:28.175 --> 23:34.902
effects on our satellite

23:35.455 --> 23:37.798
Ah yes, McVitie was another one of those. Vinty, 
John Vinty, when he was at MIT. But that was, you

23:42.505 --> 23:45.108
know, basically that was it. Yeah, and these guys 
were all getting on in years. There were really no

23:48.934 --> 23:52.058
young people involved in that field. They'd all 
gone into astrophysics. And so what happened when

23:54.902 --> 24:00.670
satellites became important was that a number of 
people got interested in celestial mechanics and

24:00.937 --> 24:12.767
dynamical astronomy that probably would not have 
done so had it not been for that particular

24:00.937 --> 24:12.767
evidence.

24:14.449 --> 24:21.435
I want to get back to that, but I want to ask you now, 
when did you show up? I think you mentioned it here

24:21.455 --> 24:22.836
at UT. 66, August of 1966. Well, what was the 
faculty like then? How many folks were there? I

24:28.220 --> 24:29.121
think there were seven. Let me see. Let's see, Andy 
Young was here,

24:30.738 --> 24:52.504
Frank Edmonds was here, Bob Tull was here, Gerard 
de Beauvelure, Harlan, of course,

24:30.738 --> 24:52.504
Terry Deeney, myself. Is that seven? I think so. I 
think I would have. And Jim Douglas. So I was the

24:57.606 --> 24:58.426
eighth. I was the eighth person. There were seven 
before I came. There was eight afterwards. And

25:02.551 --> 25:04.072
this building hadn't been built. This building 
had not been built. We were in the old physics

25:05.514 --> 25:08.917
building, which is over near the tower.

25:14.142 --> 25:17.626
This department's a lot bigger now, so is the 
McDonald's staff. Better? Better. It is. Oh,

25:21.570 --> 25:22.231
yeah. The young people that we've brought into 
this department, some of them are really

25:22.251 --> 25:25.534
outstanding. You just take a look at the prizes 
that they've been taking home.

25:34.702 --> 25:37.426
Did you, well, it's an obvious question. You're 
taking NASA money now. Have you done so in the past

25:40.590 --> 25:44.415
before the HST? Not personally. I did take some 
NASA money. Indirectly,

25:53.105 --> 26:05.804
Byron Tapley had some which I was using to support 
some computing and also to support publication of

25:53.105 --> 26:05.804
papers. I was involved also with this outer planet 
satellite project that Darryl was the PI on.

26:15.198 --> 26:18.122
But that was pretty much it. Well, you have had 
recent experience.

26:25.596 --> 26:29.760
How do you think NSA handles these things, either 
in the past or today? I mean, do they micromanage?

26:31.642 --> 26:35.125
Do they… Well, I've not been micromanaged. I can 
only speak to my own experience. That's just

26:37.027 --> 26:39.489
exactly what I want. I've been given fairly free 
reign to do as I thought needed to be done. There

26:45.735 --> 26:50.820
have been the first twelve or so years, however, 
thirteen maybe, were a contract, not a grant. And

26:54.771 --> 26:59.896
so there were certain reporting requirements and 
so forth that were laid upon us. And there were

26:59.996 --> 27:02.039
certain things that had to be done. So what was the 
contract for? This was the contract

27:03.921 --> 27:13.551
for the HST's astrometry science team, is what it 
was called, something like that. Get the exact

27:13.911 --> 27:16.974
name over from the people there. But it was run out 
of Marshall. Most of the science team got their

27:20.095 --> 27:22.819
money from Goddard. But you know how the HST 
project was fragmented among several different

27:23.640 --> 27:34.013
centers so that they could sort of spread the money 
around. And Marshall had the prime contract with

27:34.053 --> 27:38.940
the Optical Telescope Assembly. And the Optical 
Telescope Assembly included the fine guidance

27:39.521 --> 27:42.805
sensors. And the fine guidance sensors were the 
astrometric instrument, in quotes. And

27:47.011 --> 27:52.416
therefore, my money came from Marshall and not 
from Goddard. Are you getting any results? Some.

27:56.480 --> 28:01.384
It's been a long, difficult period for us. Yeah, 
they can't show pretty pictures of what you're

28:01.404 --> 28:03.606
doing. Well, that's part of it. And part of it has 
been that not so much the optical problems,

28:05.248 --> 28:16.798
although the optical problems do pose 
difficulties for us, but they're of a different

28:05.248 --> 28:16.798
nature And they are not the principal problem that 
we have faced. The principal problem that we have

28:20.707 --> 28:29.159
faced is, until fairly recently, the telescope 
was not a very stable platform. The problems with

28:29.339 --> 28:40.855
the solar panels, which bend when you go in and out 
of the terminator, have caused a lot of stability

28:29.339 --> 28:40.855
problems for us, in particular loss of lock 
problems. And it wasn't until they finally got a

28:41.857 --> 28:46.363
much better pointing control system algorithm in 
the telescope that we were able to rely on it as a

28:46.968 --> 28:58.548
platform and actually take the calibration data 
that we needed to take. This parallel between

29:00.371 --> 29:09.567
planetary astronomy and celestial mechanics is 
pretty interesting in that both kind of died lousy

29:09.918 --> 29:18.190
early in this century, and they were represented 
by just a few people, and then when the space age

29:09.918 --> 29:18.190
came, bang.

29:21.114 --> 29:22.116
So let me ask you this. Let's talk about celestial 
mechanics now. What was NASA's influence on that

29:28.545 --> 29:33.512
the other day? Well, they've done pretty well 
without N.A.S.A. funding or did it work?

29:38.320 --> 29:39.021
Celestial Mechanics? Yeah. Oh, I don't think it 
would have done well at all without the funding

29:39.642 --> 29:47.313
that's come into it, particularly in the early 
years because most of that, well, D.O.D. also

29:47.393 --> 29:50.698
provided money for some of these efforts. Like to 
me. Yeah. As a pacifist, I would have had

29:54.924 --> 29:57.729
difficulty taking D.O.D. money and I've never 
accepted DOD money with the exception of that trip

29:59.429 --> 30:11.041
that I took to Turkey, which was actually under 
NATO and not under DOD itself, although probably

29:59.429 --> 30:11.041
the money originally originated there. Harlan

30:12.402 --> 30:28.339
was also a Quaker, as I am, but he felt that it was a 
good thing to take money from the Department of

30:12.402 --> 30:28.339
Defense because it then could not be used for other 
things. I don't think that that's a true

30:30.357 --> 30:37.687
perception of the way things actually work, but 
that's sometimes the excuse that he gave me.

30:39.349 --> 30:42.634
So we differed in that respect. But I think that a 
major portion of the money that went into

30:43.635 --> 30:52.867
celestial mechanics did come from NASA. An awful 
lot of, if you take a look at bibliographies and

30:58.120 --> 31:05.989
acknowledgments on papers, you'll very often see 
NASA support in many of those early papers. If you

31:07.731 --> 31:16.000
go look around 1900, here's your big-time 
astronomers, our celestial mechanicians, all

31:07.731 --> 31:16.000
right? Simon Newcomb,

31:18.203 --> 31:27.233
Moulton, Professor Moriarty.

31:27.584 --> 31:41.745
And then, I mean, that was really the in thing, just 
like gravitational

31:27.584 --> 31:41.745
waves are now, or the way astrophysics was in the 
1930s. Why did it die? I mean, did it run up against

31:43.588 --> 31:49.717
the wall, or was it just there were so many other 
things going on? Well, I don't know. That's an

31:50.999 --> 31:52.601
interesting question. I've not really thought 
about it terribly much. Clearly, fields only

31:57.537 --> 32:07.010
continue to prosper if you can get new students 
interested in those fields. I think that's a major

32:07.571 --> 32:20.068
situation because in the 20s and 30s, there was, as 
you correctly point out, a flowering of

32:07.571 --> 32:20.068
astrophysics and people were going into that 
field because now it was possible to learn things

32:07.571 --> 32:20.068
about stars. Yeah, the hot shots like Menzel and 
everything. It was possible to learn things about

32:22.131 --> 32:26.717
stars that could not have been learned before This 
was partly due to new instrumentation. It was also

32:29.590 --> 32:39.183
partly due to the fact that you had quantum 
mechanics, which enabled you to do correct

32:29.590 --> 32:39.183
physics in a way that was not possible. We began to 
understand why stars shine in a detailed way, and

32:39.643 --> 32:51.760
we were able to make detailed to get a detailed 
understanding of what the physics in the

32:52.313 --> 32:57.218
atmospheres of stars was. And so that's where the 
best minds went, because that's where the

32:58.199 --> 33:05.107
interest was. That's where the cutting edge was. 
And so people weren't going into celestial

33:08.430 --> 33:11.914
mechanics, mostly. And people weren't going into 
astrometry, mostly, even though there was and

33:12.955 --> 33:19.722
still is a very, very great need for basic 
astronomical data, they're not glamorous

33:19.938 --> 33:24.804
fields. It takes too long to get a parallax. It 
takes years and years to get the data to get a

33:27.687 --> 33:30.471
parallax. And then you look back on your life and 
you've published 30 parallaxes, or 40

33:30.491 --> 33:41.264
parallaxes, or 100 parallaxes, and that's it. 
When you could have

33:43.227 --> 33:49.354
done something much splashier. And so I think 
that's probably the reason. It's a combination of

33:55.002 --> 33:56.704
things. Well, it is odd, because I got in on it just 
while I went over to the astronomy department,

33:58.447 --> 34:10.484
because they had just started their PhD program in 
Illinois, and then the Russians put up

33:58.447 --> 34:10.484
satellites. Yeah, I watched that satellite from 
the roof of our house in 1957. We were doing it from

34:17.595 --> 34:19.678
the observatory, too. And I was always like a year 
or two behind the money. After a while an essay got

34:24.929 --> 34:36.342
going and I started handing out money, but I always 
just missed all that. Let me ask you about Harlem.

34:41.789 --> 34:43.050
What's the first time you met him? I think the first 
time I met him, I'm not absolutely certain of this,

34:44.026 --> 34:52.721
he may have come to Wesleyan, and I might have met 
him when he came to Wesleyan, but it didn't stick in

34:44.026 --> 34:52.721
my memory. The first time I remember meeting him 
was at the AAS meeting in 1965, which was held at

34:52.741 --> 35:00.635
Yale. Oh, and that reminds me, there was one other 
astronomical influence on my life that I don't

35:01.236 --> 35:09.510
think I told you, that I didn't tell you about. and I 
remember this because he was also at Yale. At

35:14.253 --> 35:18.900
Michigan, there was an astronomer named Dean 
McLaughlin. Now, in 1947, Dean McLaughlin, by the

35:20.402 --> 35:32.680
way, worked for, during the summertime, he 
moonlighted as a geologist for the Pennsylvania

35:20.402 --> 35:32.680
Geological Survey. And in 1946... He predicted 
volcanoes on Mars. Could very well be. I didn't.

35:39.325 --> 35:40.026
didn't know that. But at any rate, in 1947 we had, I 
was seven years old, we moved to a farm outside of

35:40.807 --> 35:56.984
Philadelphia near Doylestown, which was in a town 
called Chalfont, Quaker country. I do want to talk

35:57.645 --> 36:03.992
a bit about that because Harlem is a Quaker and so 
we've had some relationships along that line. But

36:04.012 --> 36:08.016
at any rate, we moved out there. And one day, Dean 
McLaughlin came wandering up the crypt bed that we

36:09.228 --> 36:21.322
owned half of, looking for rocks, came knocking on 
our door. Had my mother asking for some water or

36:22.023 --> 36:25.046
something like that. My mother invited him in and 
started to chat. It turned out he was an

36:29.171 --> 36:31.093
astronomer. Well, he had a most marvelous 
compass. You know, a magnetic compass with bells

36:35.992 --> 36:43.021
and whistles and all these things on it that 
geologists like to carry with them. And I was

36:43.041 --> 36:44.703
fascinated by that. That was the first real 
astronomer I ever met. We kept up with him, at least

36:48.027 --> 36:51.832
my parents did, until he died. You know, Christmas 
cards and stuff like that. But at any rate, that

36:55.316 --> 37:04.227
meeting at Yale, I think, was the first time that I 
actually met Harlan, although I'm not absolutely

36:55.316 --> 37:04.227
certain about that. Miles Standish and I both went 
to that meeting. We had a good time thinking about

37:07.257 --> 37:17.995
all the papers on polarization of radio sources, 
which was big in those days. We decided that all the

37:18.055 --> 37:21.160
papers were exactly alike. The only thing that 
changed was the name of the source and the percent

37:21.200 --> 37:26.889
of polarization. Do you think Arlen could have 
done even more if he'd done a little less? In what

37:34.160 --> 37:34.741
way? Well, he was always driven. Always. And, you 
know, one reason your heart muscle tends to last a

37:39.788 --> 37:46.659
fairly long time is that it rests most of the time. 
Or at least part of the time you cycle. And Harlan

37:49.944 --> 37:51.746
never seemed to do that. No, he was certainly 
always working. I don't know. I think that was just

37:56.694 --> 38:00.319
the way he was. He, I don't think, would have been 
comfortable not doing that stuff. Certainly, his

38:06.628 --> 38:11.615
longevity was not affected by that. And that was a 
completely different situation and just an

38:11.795 --> 38:21.489
unhappy chance that he got the virulent cancer 
that he did. So I don't think that that shortened

38:23.271 --> 38:27.437
his life in any way.

38:29.408 --> 38:42.329
Maybe one could argue that there are things he 
might have applied himself to that would have been

38:29.408 --> 38:42.329
more fruitful than some of the things that, in 
fact, he did spend a lot of time with. But that's a

38:42.390 --> 38:44.032
matter of judgment. And of course, anybody's 
career is going to have things that . He did a lot of

38:48.099 --> 38:50.784
things, so not everything is going to be at the same 
level. Right, right.

38:54.530 --> 38:55.872
Someone was saying the other day that Harlan was 
really loyal and maybe carried that a little bit

38:56.189 --> 39:01.915
too far in some cases. I think that that may be true, 
yeah. There were projects which should have been

39:05.138 --> 39:09.663
cut off sooner. You're talking Gribble Ball? I 
think we're talking Gribble Ball in particular. I

39:13.487 --> 39:24.778
think that was the one project that was most 
visible and to which a large amount of money, you

39:13.487 --> 39:24.778
know, a comparatively large amount of money went 
without any real What

39:25.113 --> 39:37.068
do you think is the status of astronomy at the 
University of Texas now? I think we're a pretty

39:37.088 --> 39:39.531
good department. Do the higher-ups care about 
that? You mean over in the tower? You mean the big

39:45.778 --> 39:46.539
shots? I think they do, to a certain degree. We've 
got a new president now, and I don't know how clued

39:56.011 --> 39:59.559
into the excellence of our program he is. And

39:59.599 --> 40:09.902
so we'll find out in due course, I suppose. I always 
felt that we got support from Bill Cunningham

40:10.304 --> 40:19.160
while he was president, and he's now down in the 
system, so I think he still does support us.

40:20.662 --> 40:31.882
They've put their prestige where their mouths are 
in the sense that they've decided to go ahead with

40:20.662 --> 40:31.882
the SST project, which is, I think, a very 
important project for our department. Now, I

40:31.922 --> 40:35.248
guess I should talk to the people at SST. And, well, 
I'm going to be talking with Tom Barton about that,

40:36.730 --> 40:42.116
too. But it always seemed to me weird, the way this 
thing's been going on, that, you know, well, you

40:42.597 --> 40:49.525
can't really go out and get money. I always thought 
that the way to run a place was to say, go get all the

40:49.545 --> 40:52.929
money you can get. And, you know, I mean, gee whiz. 
I'll tell you one thing. When I was in

40:57.894 --> 41:05.303
headquarters, when Harlan was here, when the 
107-inch telescope opportunity came along, What

41:05.924 --> 41:06.585
was his name? Dr. Death. You know, the president of 
Boston University. Oh, you mean John Silber, yes.

41:12.893 --> 41:14.335
John Silber was the dean. And he didn't go fooling 
around. What, NASA wants to give us $3 million for a

41:16.118 --> 41:18.781
telescope? Hell yes. That was it, you know. Well, 
the difference is that with the SST, the money has

41:21.946 --> 41:25.631
to be privately raised. And

41:26.912 --> 41:35.644
I think the administration was concerned that... 
the money that we, A, might not be able to raise all

41:36.772 --> 41:49.711
the money that we needed, or that, and this is 
another important thing, or that, B, we would

41:36.772 --> 41:49.711
raise the money that we said that we needed and it 
would turn out to cost more than we thought. And I

41:49.731 --> 41:58.585
still think that they do have in mind the 107-inch, 
which was well over budget. I remember that very

41:58.605 --> 41:59.927
well. Tell me, Harlan's One of the people I can't 
interview, the other one is Kuiper. Tell me

42:08.569 --> 42:12.314
something about

42:08.569 --> 42:12.314
Harlan. Tell me all you know about Harlan. All I 
know about Harlan, well, that's all. You know,

42:16.620 --> 42:18.763
please send me everything you have on this ground.

42:21.667 --> 42:24.751
I'm not interested in his great scientific 
accomplishments or anything. My fondest

42:24.771 --> 42:31.821
memories of Harlan are as a friend.

42:33.640 --> 42:44.073
He recognized my talents in a way more than I 
recognized my own, certainly when he first met me.

42:44.894 --> 42:51.383
And he laid opportunities in my path that I might 
not have had otherwise.

42:56.630 --> 43:01.656
He and Joan joined the friends meeting 
Connecticut. I don't know which monthly meeting

43:02.826 --> 43:04.910
it was. Joan would be able to tell you that. Back 
when they were there and in fact even today I think

43:08.937 --> 43:25.686
one of Joan's very closest friends is was a member 
of that meeting and

43:26.932 --> 43:28.574
They still live in Connecticut. They came down 
here during the time that Harlan was ill and then

43:28.874 --> 43:45.753
after he died and really played a very major role in

43:28.874 --> 43:45.753
helping the family through this crisis. Charles 
Chu and I've forgotten his wife's name. That's

43:51.860 --> 43:53.461
terrible.

43:55.604 --> 43:56.685
Betty, I think it is. but I'm not absolutely 
certain of that. But, again, you can ask Joan about

44:00.195 --> 44:03.320
that. By the way, I did see her in January at the AAS 
meeting, the DPS, too late, Dave Howland, the big

44:03.340 --> 44:10.452
award. And she's agreed to do some interviews. I'm 
going to see Jim Douglas tomorrow morning. He's

44:16.341 --> 44:17.823
going to bring what he has. Right. And so, at any 
rate, when we came to Austin, I had... When I was

44:24.847 --> 44:31.773
young, I had attended the Friends Meeting out in 
Doylestown, Pennsylvania, when we were out there

44:24.847 --> 44:31.773
in the countryside there. My father, although he 
was an Episcopal clergyman, he was going through a

44:31.874 --> 44:39.401
crisis at that point. And so we started attending 
the Friends Meeting there. And I got introduced

44:42.383 --> 44:44.846
and always liked the Quakers. And when we came 
here, we joined this meeting. Harlan and Joan had

44:49.030 --> 44:54.735
already transferred their membership down here. 
And we've been involved with Friends Meeting here

44:55.120 --> 45:01.590
for quite a long time, since about 25 years.

45:04.535 --> 45:16.895
So, you know,

45:04.535 --> 45:16.895
I have memories of Harlan making ice cream for the 
Friends Meeting. Peach ice cream, it always

45:16.995 --> 45:19.640
seemed to be. It could have been vanilla, but very 
often it was peach. He loved it. And he'd bring the

45:23.133 --> 45:41.996
old hand-wound ice cream freezer to meeting, and 
we'd all take turns cranking it, and then we'd have

45:23.133 --> 45:41.996
it for dessert after our potluck lunch on some 
Sunday, some hot Sunday. And that was wonderful.

45:44.499 --> 45:52.549
And he would have the meeting over to his home for 
Christmas on a number of occasions.

45:53.153 --> 45:56.256
They had wonderful toys in that house. Puzzles, 
really solid mathematical type puzzles that the

45:56.276 --> 46:02.863
kids owned. Real mind benders. Real mind benders. 
And they were the kind of puzzle that would last

46:05.125 --> 46:08.488
forever. Not something that would break five 
minutes after you got it. And

46:12.773 --> 46:23.143
so I always felt that that was a very wonderful kind 
of thing Well, why don't you just...
