WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:17.533
were cackled okay and uh bull neck was meat all 
right now was ham bull neck also as far as i can

00:03.068 --> 00:17.533
remember bacon was bull neck Yeah. Any meat. Any 
meat. As I recall, that's been a long time ago,

00:20.336 --> 00:23.520
Haskell. Was all dessert kush? Yes. That was the 
general term. Pie, cake. It was kush. Okay.

00:31.670 --> 00:33.693
Ketchup was blood. Tea was horse. Don't remember. 
I think I intentionally have forgotten some of

00:39.841 --> 00:47.250
that stuff because it wasn't something that I 
wanted to remember. Can you share with the machine

00:47.230 --> 00:57.912
any pranks, tricks you remember ever observing 
being played in the dining hall where somebody did

00:47.230 --> 00:57.912
something to somebody else's food? They were 
always throwing food, and you had biscuits on the

00:58.373 --> 01:03.663
ceiling. I thought that was part of the 
decoration. But there was always harassing going

01:08.003 --> 01:17.617
on between tables and involving the food or 
involving the individuals. But most people got in

01:19.059 --> 01:24.006
there and tried to get eaten and back to class.

01:27.091 --> 01:27.692
Let's see. We talked about your outfit. How 
important, as you look back on it, how important

01:33.130 --> 01:39.620
was BAAA to you in your life? Well, I think that was 
home, and you developed a very close relationship

01:41.062 --> 01:48.653
with the people that were in that unit. They were 
difficult on campus, but you always had the

01:51.217 --> 02:02.293
feeling when we'd go on court trips and like that, 
the upperclassmen took care of you. It became a

02:03.404 --> 02:09.297
very close-knit family unit, and certainly your 
fish buddies did. We still get together

02:10.760 --> 02:13.405
regularly. They come down here, Raul Fernandez, 
Billy Fernandez, Tommy Lowman, Wesley Heald, so

02:23.198 --> 02:31.336
those guys that were in that unit, very close 
friends even today. Do you remember any incident

02:31.857 --> 02:38.912
events during that freshman year that began to 
demonstrate that closeness?

02:41.727 --> 02:46.912
Well, of course, we had to stick together during 
these hazing sessions. And when we would go on

02:47.413 --> 02:55.121
court trips, those were the guys you stuck around 
with because you knew them well. They became just

02:56.582 --> 02:58.724
like family. And

02:59.926 --> 03:09.996
nobody, we had one car, Fish Burt had a pink 
Studebaker. and out of those 43 that freshman

03:10.550 --> 03:13.954
year. So we essentially had no car because 43 of us 
couldn't get in that pink Studebaker.

03:26.027 --> 03:28.229
But we hitchhiked to ball games. We had, every now 
and then you'd get a ride with an upperclassman.

03:34.956 --> 03:36.618
It was a, it was a different world. Can you describe 
your first court trip? I didn't go to California on

03:40.722 --> 03:44.305
that first game. I know a lot of the freshmen in the 
band went. But the first court trip we hitchhiked

03:47.808 --> 04:01.300
to

03:47.808 --> 04:01.300
Fort Worth, I believe it was TCU, and marched at the 
game. Of course, back then you went in as a unit to

04:01.540 --> 04:09.987
all the games, except basketball, where you had to 
alternate. Aircroppers got every other home

04:10.608 --> 04:19.599
basketball game, and Army got every other one. And 
we'd feel derogatory because you knew that you

04:20.621 --> 04:34.138
only had half the chance to see those games, and 
knowing that you were excluded made it important

04:20.621 --> 04:34.138
that you were there when you had the chance to be 
there. Now, how did you get to Fort Worth for that

04:35.660 --> 04:38.383
court trip, that first one? Hitchhiking. Went 
over to the stand over at Northgate by the post

04:40.055 --> 04:47.005
office and got in line. And you always made sure 
your bag had a Texas Aggie sticker on it. And you'd

04:53.434 --> 04:56.138
get rides. Sometimes you knew as soon as you got in 
you'd made a mistake. Other times it was a

05:01.065 --> 05:03.969
delightful experience. Met some very 
interesting people hitchhiking to Gaines and to

05:04.009 --> 05:08.155
Holm. We're now including all of your years of 
experience in hitchhiking. Share the highest and

05:13.548 --> 05:19.292
the lowest experience you remember in Aggie 
hitchhiking. What? Well, one Friday afternoon, I

05:20.353 --> 05:27.419
think it was just before Christmas because I knew I 
had some books with me. Caught a ride with a fellow

05:28.961 --> 05:37.348
who was a dealer at Galveston in one of the casinos 
down there, and he had just gotten a job in Las

05:38.240 --> 05:43.447
Vegas. And he picked me up and said, do you have a 
driver's license? Yes. Driving a Cadillac. I

05:55.384 --> 05:57.467
don't ever remember being in one until then. He had 
worked all day, and so he wanted me to drive. So I

06:01.853 --> 06:07.521
drove 428 miles to Wellington, We got there just 
about sun up and mama invited him in and he slept for

06:08.581 --> 06:22.159
a couple of hours in bed and fed him breakfast and on 
he went. Probably the most disappointing ride was

06:23.661 --> 06:31.551
when I caught a ride in a pickup with a farmer from 
Hearn. Took about three hours to get to her.

06:37.544 --> 06:40.007
And everything was passing us. And he let me out on 
this side of town. And you can't get a ride going

06:44.352 --> 06:50.859
north if you're on the south part of town. That and 
experiences of getting a ride with someone that's

06:50.899 --> 06:56.105
drunk that won't let you drive. And those are. Did 
that happen a few times? A couple. No accident, but

07:04.598 --> 07:08.148
it was quite knuckle time. But you never had a bad 
experience. Not really. I haven't found anybody

07:13.322 --> 07:15.949
yet that did. I started hitchhiking when I was in 
high school because I worked at Plainview when I

07:16.418 --> 07:31.333
lived at Wellington in the summers before my 
freshman year and then between freshman and

07:16.418 --> 07:31.333
sophomore and sophomore and junior years in high 
school. And I always hitchhiked over to Plainview

07:32.214 --> 07:35.037
and would hitchhike home. And never had a few scary 
instances where people were drunk. A couple that I

07:43.305 --> 07:46.088
vividly remember. But by and large, you met some 
very interesting people. Let's go back to court

07:51.051 --> 07:54.335
trips.

07:57.178 --> 08:07.131
During all of your undergraduate years, describe 
some of the court trips and where you all stayed and

07:57.178 --> 08:07.131
some of the good times that you had. Well, we nearly 
always stayed with the parent of one of the

08:07.769 --> 08:12.874
freshmen in our outfit. And, of course, we slept on 
the vans and in the floor and what have you, always

08:12.894 --> 08:21.282
ate well.

08:26.707 --> 08:31.732
And that might be how many, that one place? 10 to 15 
of us, just wherever we could find a... A open spot.

08:42.085 --> 08:44.669
But that was fairly common back then. Of the court 
trips, what was your favorite place? I

08:47.673 --> 08:54.244
don't think I really had one. I enjoyed the trip we 
drove when I was a senior to the Arkansas game. But

09:03.473 --> 09:06.218
that wasn't a court trip, but you still went. Yeah. 
And left on Friday afternoon after we got out of

09:07.641 --> 09:12.870
labs and drove all night. Stopped at Mount 
Pleasant Fish Messer's house and had breakfast.

09:21.085 --> 09:25.633
Got into Arkansas, oh, about 11. Dead tired and. 
Some of the Arkansas students invited us to. Come

09:33.271 --> 09:35.274
into the door. And we slept for about two hours. I 
was sleeping. They shined our boots as a senior

09:41.682 --> 09:46.107
and. Was just spectacular. And we made that and 
then drove back after the game. Can you remember

09:55.027 --> 10:05.663
any incredible, goofy, unbelievable events 
connected with going to some game somewhere?

10:06.824 --> 10:10.550
Well, yeah, the TCU game when I was a junior. 
Leaving the game, we got caught between the

10:12.773 --> 10:22.367
athletic dorm, and that's when the...

10:24.575 --> 10:27.460
editor of the Aggieland that year. He was a senior, 
got whooped. And we got in a

10:30.585 --> 10:47.494
group, the Aggies did, surrounded by TCU 
students, and it took us about an hour to work our

10:30.585 --> 10:47.494
way on about three blocks to our vehicles.

10:50.292 --> 11:01.143
I can't think of the military science professor, 
and he's still around here, that was kind of

10:50.292 --> 11:01.143
keeping us together. But we had some experiences 
like that that you remember as being rather

11:02.524 --> 11:10.211
incredible. All right, now let's go academic. 
Early on, who did you turn to for academic advice

11:14.115 --> 11:20.181
and counsel? uh dr gaines and dr little over in 
entomology g-a-i-n-e-s he was the head of the

11:21.123 --> 11:45.696
department dr little was the advisor student 
advisor for years and years i think he came here in

11:21.123 --> 11:45.696
about 1927. can you give some examples of the 
advice you got from them uh they just told you what

11:21.123 --> 11:45.696
courses you had to take needed to take And, of 
course, they advised you as far as what electives

11:46.165 --> 11:55.658
to take. They were good counsel when you got down, 
lonely when the whole world was picking on you.

12:06.567 --> 12:16.145
They were valuable advisors at that point, as well 
as the Wesley Foundation Director of the church.

12:16.786 --> 12:19.170
Were they available when you needed them? Yes.

12:24.600 --> 12:30.010
It was a much smaller place than it is nowadays. It 
was much like a high school situation. You could

12:33.921 --> 12:37.404
walk into their office and it was like talking to 
your dad. Do you remember that? You had respect for

12:38.766 --> 12:47.095
them and you had a little bit of, felt a little 
intimidated simply because of their position. Do

12:47.135 --> 12:48.816
you remember? Not the personality or how you were 
treated. Remember how many freshmen there were

12:51.920 --> 12:54.242
your freshman year? There were about 77 or 7800 
total students at A&M. And I

13:04.159 --> 13:16.955
would guess that when we first registered and 
official count was made is somewhere around 1200.

13:19.899 --> 13:22.703
Because we would lose about half of them. And you 
started out in entomology? Yes. You never changed

13:25.514 --> 13:27.677
your major. Which is really unusual because I 
think I was either the first or second because most

13:27.697 --> 13:34.786
people had no idea what entomology was. And most of 
them were recruited because entomology,

13:45.910 --> 13:52.879
101 with introductory entomology was a required 
course essentially by everyone, even engineers.

13:53.079 --> 13:56.783
Certain engineer majors took that as a science. 
Who taught that? Dr. Little. And what was it like?

14:00.848 --> 14:02.210
Describe that course. Well, it basically dealt 
with the classification of insects and what their

14:02.610 --> 14:12.863
role in society today and a little bit on controls 
and on behavior and habits. There was no

14:18.313 --> 14:21.418
collection or anything like that required. It was 
three hours of lecture. And then you had one

14:23.702 --> 14:33.700
three-hour lab that you looked at insects, 
identified them, studied the biology, looked at

14:23.702 --> 14:33.700
the different life stages. And you probably liked 
it. Yes, but I liked some of the later courses that

14:36.518 --> 14:54.638
were more specific in terms of the introductory 
course is very broad, very general, has a lot of the

14:36.518 --> 14:54.638
whiz, bang, wow type information. It was 
interesting. But it wasn't challenging like some

14:57.511 --> 15:03.020
of the later courses that you took. Some other 
courses that first year that were, you recall?

15:07.748 --> 15:16.363
Well, you could say that freshman chemistry was a 
course that most guys in my class majored in. They

15:18.183 --> 15:25.833
often took it each semester until they were 
seniors, and some of them never did pass it, but.

15:26.053 --> 15:30.439
Who taught that course?

15:30.459 --> 15:31.320
Was it Stubbs? I know he taught chemistry. I think 
that he taught. Did y'all have a nickname for him?

15:39.571 --> 15:43.496
Yes, but I don't remember it. And it was a tough 
course? For you? No. I was so scared of it going in

15:47.413 --> 15:52.337
that I spent a lot of time on it. And so I only took 
freshman chemistry, both the inorganic, which

15:53.278 --> 16:03.608
was the first semester, and the organic second 
semester one time. I was very fortunate. English?

16:10.654 --> 16:11.855
We had English literature. We had history. 
American history. Who taught it? Do you remember?

16:19.769 --> 16:29.679
Zingaro taught our

16:19.769 --> 16:29.679
physics class, but that was sophomore year when I 
took the physics. I took chemistry, history,

16:30.280 --> 16:36.226
English, biology.

16:39.429 --> 16:41.211
Dr. Baldorf taught it. in military science and PE. 
And do you remember how you did that first semester

16:47.357 --> 16:49.900
academically? I know that those first two exams 
tried to stay up all night and you don't do that

16:51.201 --> 16:57.809
because you go to sleep in the exams. Not very well. 
I made about a 42 on the chemistry exam

17:00.292 --> 17:11.485
and below 50 on

17:14.283 --> 17:15.344
the math exam. And

17:17.107 --> 17:27.922
figured out that there are better ways of 
approaching studying and getting rest and how to

17:17.107 --> 17:27.922
study. So there were some trials. But you passed 
everything the first semester? Yeah. I made one B.

17:37.295 --> 17:38.256
The rest of them were A's. Oh, oh. You said not very 
well. Oh, so you didn't spend it. Quiz A, like to

17:43.595 --> 17:46.299
kill me, scared the life out of me. I figured that I 
was probably going to be headed home at

17:46.419 --> 17:50.145
mid-semester. But I probably would have to have a 
new one because I wasn't going to be welcomed as the

17:51.447 --> 17:58.238
one I'd left. How often did you communicate with 
your parents? About once a week, I wrote. Mail was

18:04.809 --> 18:06.131
delivered in the door. They put it on your door. 
When I say they, we, as freshmen, the freshmen

18:09.413 --> 18:13.238
delivered mail. It was brought in a sack and dumped 
in the guard room in each dorm, and then it was mail

18:13.258 --> 18:21.409
called. They were delivered to the door. Did your 
parents write to you? Yes. Mama did. And Daddy told

18:27.657 --> 18:30.381
her what he wanted to say. And about how often were 
there any phone calls between you and them? I don't

18:35.768 --> 18:37.530
ever remember a phone call. And where was the 
nearest phone to your room? In the guard room.

18:43.334 --> 18:44.415
There was one in the dorm. And a freshman manned it, 
answered it, and another freshman was there. You

18:50.061 --> 18:50.862
had phone duty. And two people were assigned, two 
freshmen were assigned to be there. And the

18:55.727 --> 19:01.113
schedule was worked out from about 6 in the morning 
until about midnight. Surely you know that

19:01.533 --> 19:06.218
today's students cannot believe there wasn't a 
phone in every room. Well, there was. There was no

19:08.747 --> 19:12.552
air conditioning either. That's right. So you did 
well that first. What led you, was it the high

19:14.455 --> 19:19.441
school preparation? As you look back on it, what 
was the secret to your doing well academically?

19:25.649 --> 19:25.930
Fear.

19:30.395 --> 19:35.862
Someone asked me one time how I ended up going to 
college. Mm-hmm. And I really don't know. I think

19:40.887 --> 19:47.255
it was just an undiscussed expectation in our 
home. Both my mother, mother went to Tarleton and

19:49.178 --> 19:54.144
my dad went to Tarleton and then A&M. I think it was 
just an expectation. And I don't ever remember us

19:58.530 --> 20:04.217
discussing whether or not you would go to college. 
What do you think would have been the result if you

20:04.636 --> 20:14.867
had announced to them that you had decided you 
would not go to college?

20:14.887 --> 20:19.291
I think that I would have been overruled, but I 
don't know that. When I said that to my dad about

20:20.472 --> 20:28.821
five years ago, he looked at me and he said, you knew 
damn good and well you'd have found a place to sleep

20:20.472 --> 20:28.821
that night. But it was just an expectation, and it 
was not really discussed that that's what you,

20:29.527 --> 20:42.445
that was part of your getting an education. Share 
with, when you mention your dad and Tarleton,

20:42.465 --> 20:56.004
share with me this machine, all that you can recall 
that he ever shared about Earl Rudder, his

20:42.465 --> 20:56.004
roommate? Well, he and Earl... Both were their own 
athletic scholarships. And what an athletic

21:01.232 --> 21:07.061
scholarship was back then was the cow. Someone had 
donated a cow to Tarleton. And they, and this was

21:10.186 --> 21:18.780
the jersey, and they staked her out on the football 
field where she grazed. And then they would bring

21:20.042 --> 21:25.931
her into the shower and milk her into the bottles. 
Mm-hmm. milk bottles that were glass, that were

21:27.290 --> 21:37.022
delivered to the faculty who paid for that milk, 
and that's their scholarship. And they would wash

21:37.042 --> 21:39.805
the bottles out in the shower.

21:42.628 --> 21:52.780
I don't know, they never had any refrigeration or 
anything, but that was probably the most

21:42.628 --> 21:52.780
interesting thing that I can remember. Now, Mrs. 
Rudder, in sharing that story, story with me said

21:56.467 --> 22:04.444
that as she understood it from Earl the cow became 
available when Mr. Rudder in the spring of his

22:04.544 --> 22:17.631
first year told the coach he was going to go back to 
Eden gonna drop out because he needed some money

22:04.544 --> 22:17.631
and that the cow then was made available Does that 
say? I wasn't aware of those details. I just

22:25.240 --> 22:30.325
remember dad telling about their scholarship at 
Tarleton. Were they the same year? Yes. Okay.

22:34.229 --> 22:35.971
Graduated in 32, I believe. And your dad had gone to 
what high school?

22:42.618 --> 22:44.520
Roscoe, outside of Sweetwater. What position did 
he play? He was a halfback, and what he really was

22:46.585 --> 23:01.383
able to do at Tarleton to get enough money to stay 
there was he was a left-handed pitcher. And on

23:01.403 --> 23:03.926
weekends, he would go out to Sol Ross. There was a 
gentleman out there that was an avid baseball fan.

23:09.312 --> 23:14.719
He had a semi-pro team, and they would pay $25 a 
game. And so he would pitch either Saturday or

23:14.918 --> 23:17.764
Sunday. Did your dad also do that in the summers out 
there? Yeah. And that's the reason he got a job

23:23.797 --> 23:26.563
during the Depression. What position did, or 
football position, did Mr. Rutter play? Do you

23:30.752 --> 23:31.112
know? I don't. He was either a center or a tackle. 
Okay. Do you remember your dad talking about Mr.

23:38.494 --> 23:42.101
Rudder as a person, what kind of person he was like? 
Well, he had a great deal of respect and admiration

23:42.281 --> 23:45.968
for Earl Rudder. From his student? From his 
student years, and then they stayed in touch.

23:53.803 --> 23:57.229
He and Mrs. Rudder who, she told me that her name was 
Margaret, it wasn't Chick, so we better not put

23:59.097 --> 24:06.750
that in this text. But I didn't know what her name 
was until I babysat with, when I was a student here

24:07.110 --> 24:15.925
with their kids when they would be gone. And she was 
Chick, right? I didn't know anything else. That's

24:20.892 --> 24:22.915
what I've heard a number of others say. And she told 
me here about 10 years ago, don't you ever call me

24:22.935 --> 24:29.465
Chick. So I said, well, what do I call you? And she 
said, Margaret. She also told me that, she phrased

24:34.091 --> 24:42.283
it, Earl told her that one of the first times he 
delivered the milk to somebody, the bottle wasn't

24:42.432 --> 24:46.158
quite full, and the man complained about that. And 
she said that Earl said, well, there was a water

24:46.959 --> 24:51.766
faucet near where we, and from then on the bottle. 
Made sure that it was full. That it was full. Did

24:55.692 --> 25:02.222
your father have any, share any memories about Mr. 
Rutter as a student?

25:05.446 --> 25:07.169
Not that I ever recall. Was he one of the group 
thoroughly? Yes. personality-wise and from a

25:12.166 --> 25:17.091
leadership standpoint. Back then, he was one that 
led them in all kinds of trouble.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.603
And did he make good grades? I have no idea. Grades 
were not discussed. All right, let's come back

25:36.369 --> 25:41.734
then to academics for you. During that freshman 
year, your interest in entomology never wavered.

25:47.635 --> 25:48.456
It got stronger? Well, of course, as most kids, 
when you come down here, you're not real sure of

25:48.737 --> 25:54.245
what you want to major in. And I always 
entertained, thought, well, I might want to major

25:54.625 --> 26:01.716
in chemical engineering. And so I kept that in mind 
and looked at it through my sophomore year, but

26:02.337 --> 26:10.489
never took it seriously. And then in selecting 
electives, I took a number of economics courses,

26:11.279 --> 26:19.112
accounting, international finance, business 
law, as electives, and did get a degree in

26:19.362 --> 26:27.974
economics along with my entomology. Titium 
influenced that a lot, the actual getting a

26:30.096 --> 26:34.282
degree. I was taking the courses over there, so I 
had interaction with a number of the staff members

26:34.302 --> 26:40.671
in economics. Describe, summarize your 
recollections of Titium.

26:46.413 --> 26:50.319
A very impressive person and very active on 
campus. You heard and saw a lot of the man.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.632
Very personable, very friendly. Went out of his 
way to make sure that students were doing well. Did

27:07.385 --> 27:10.750
they have any needs, any problems that he could 
help with? Just someone that you said, now this is a

27:11.219 --> 27:18.795
mentor on this campus. Now you said you majored in 
economics or ag economics? Ag economics. Did you

27:24.747 --> 27:27.152
have any economics courses? Al Chalk, anybody 
like that? Well, I think about half the course.

27:30.958 --> 27:34.444
Accounting, I think, was taught over in economics 
rather than ag-eco. Business law was taught over

27:35.245 --> 27:38.470
in economics. Who was that? I don't remember.

27:45.982 --> 27:52.532
International finance was taught over in ag-eco.

27:55.448 --> 28:03.139
So at the end of your freshman year, how did you feel 
about being an Aggie and your chances of survival?

28:04.541 --> 28:10.669
Well, I was going to beat them before they could 
beat me. And I think it's simply a matter of being

28:11.691 --> 28:18.800
pleased that you were able to survive that. Always 
was impressed with the... reputation of A&M in the

28:23.393 --> 28:28.799
Ag arena, and that was the one that I was most 
familiar with. I got involved in a lot of campus

28:30.181 --> 28:37.449
activities outside the Corps and the outfit. I was 
freshman class president, got involved in MSC,

28:37.469 --> 28:49.123
SCONA, and those took up a lot of time. I was always

28:53.498 --> 28:59.886
impressed here with how student government is 
run. Go over there and you see the secretaries and

28:59.906 --> 29:04.192
you see these people's schedules. And I remember 
as student body president or student senate

29:04.853 --> 29:19.692
president, as it was called back then, getting 
ready for a meeting and typing your agenda on the

29:04.853 --> 29:19.692
hunt and peck typewriter in your dorm. and going 
over and getting Dean Penberthy to run off enough

29:20.903 --> 29:29.749
copies for all of the members of the Student 
Senate. And you go over there now and it's bigger

29:30.218 --> 29:42.117
than the president's office was back then when 
Harrington and Rudder and them were in the

29:30.218 --> 29:42.117
president's office. And it's run much more 
business-like and the amount of copies of stuff

29:42.217 --> 29:54.657
that are run off, the amount of help, the students, 
ability to organize and to plan activities, just

29:55.008 --> 30:04.765
impressive the kinds of exposure they get and what 
you can get done. Like comparing a manual

30:05.048 --> 30:08.473
typewriter to a computer today. That's good. 
That's very good. Because I can remember even when

30:10.356 --> 30:30.808
I worked down here in the 60s and 70s, you'd type a 
manuscript for a publication, whether it was

30:10.356 --> 30:30.808
controlling cotton insects in Texas or how to 
requeen a honeybee colony. You'd write the

30:31.368 --> 30:33.672
publication up, And if you found a sentence on page 
33 that was wrong, they had to retype pages 33 on the

30:34.225 --> 30:44.603
rest of the way. Now you find that sentence in 
there, and they can do it before you wait right

30:44.624 --> 30:55.002
there at the desk, and they'll hand you the redone 
copy. Let's zero in on the student leadership

30:55.943 --> 31:02.729
because that's the important part of the story. 
How did you get to be freshman president? Describe

31:06.833 --> 31:08.114
how that came. Well, you asked a question a while 
ago about how did you get away from the dorm. That's

31:13.359 --> 31:14.460
one way. I had several upperclassmen in my outfit 
suggested that I ought to run. I had someone

31:25.947 --> 31:30.152
running for every freshman class.
