WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:17.326
probably transit authority people, suggested 
that they assumed that this transit line, if you

00:01.583 --> 00:17.326
will, if it goes in the West Park corridor, really 
wouldn't disrupt much of anything else. And my

00:17.366 --> 00:22.434
problem was that... Did you try to convince them of 
this? Urge them? It seems to me that if you're

00:24.597 --> 00:30.105
putting in... Now, it runs... It's right here. 
From West University out to Alif? Well, they

00:36.917 --> 00:38.098
leave. It runs back over here somewhere. But 
anyway, it runs out that way. It picks up Greenway

00:42.363 --> 00:45.326
and everything else. But what I... They just... We 
had a lot of arguments about what the effects would

00:47.388 --> 00:50.972
be. And they're only looking at transportation 
issues. And I say, hold on. We have certain things

00:55.718 --> 00:58.481
we're going to be blamed for. Traffic congestion, 
inefficient sewer, inefficient water, solid

00:59.142 --> 01:05.229
waste. How are we going to deal with the 
development that occurs due to your putting in

01:05.449 --> 01:12.958
virtually in another mode another freeway? And 
where you've got those transit stations, you're

01:14.520 --> 01:24.952
going to have some activity because property 
value in there is going to go sky high, and you're

01:14.520 --> 01:24.952
going to have some intensive development. And... 
I think that they're going to be looking at that,

01:25.739 --> 01:28.563
but I'm not sure. And I'm a little concerned about 
that because we'll get blamed for it. You can't get

01:32.729 --> 01:36.134
to the goddamn station because there's not enough 
street. Well, you know. Rick, there are two

01:37.957 --> 01:45.327
excellent models that exist in the world for this 
sort of opportunity.

01:46.269 --> 01:51.516
One is in Toronto, and the other is in Stockholm. 
The mass transit planning in both cases has been

01:55.928 --> 02:01.254
done hand in hand with land use planning. And the 
land use planning

02:01.274 --> 02:16.852
proceeds in total sync with the mass transit 
planning, the underground, the subway systems,

02:01.274 --> 02:16.852
or the tunnel bond out of Stockholm and so forth. 
And they would not think of planning high density

02:17.813 --> 02:24.400
unless they knew they had a transit stop there. I 
understand that Toronto in the last 20 years has

02:24.785 --> 02:38.761
made a fantastic turnaround from being a nowhere 
city of North America to possibly the showcase of

02:24.785 --> 02:38.761
how to do it today. So maybe your people ought to 
make a couple field trips. Yeah. Yeah, I went to

02:43.968 --> 02:45.229
Germany. I don't know. That was a trip I missed. But 
I'm looking at it now. The other point that we did

02:52.477 --> 03:03.371
discuss briefly that I'd like to talk about is the 
absence, it seems, in planning of a generalist

02:52.477 --> 03:03.371
planner. And you find that everyone is diving off 
into a specialty, be it health systems or

03:03.391 --> 03:16.428
transportation or whatever. And it seems like the 
role of the generalist planner, which

03:22.126 --> 03:29.516
at least used to be what planners were, that they 
knew a process and therefore could apply it to

03:22.126 --> 03:29.516
anything. I think that we've been outrun by our 
legal people. I find that most planning decisions

03:35.885 --> 03:47.841
and policy decisions that are made in a number of 
cities, including this one, that are planning

03:35.885 --> 03:47.841
decisions, are being made by lawyers. And... I'm 
not sure that that's something that was in the long

03:51.522 --> 04:01.791
term

03:51.522 --> 04:01.791
good for cities. And you can adjudicate anything. 
But there are other issues involved that a more

04:04.633 --> 04:17.444
general type planning person could probably see a 
little more of. That's why I work with the lawyer

04:17.464 --> 04:21.327
that I work with, and he and I And I deal policy. He 
deals legal. But it's a shame. I have not met very

04:26.536 --> 04:28.719
many. I'm a transportation planner. I'm a health 
planner. I've never said shit. Well, you remember

04:33.345 --> 04:39.433
in comprehensive planning, you talked about the 
concept of the hyphenated planner. Yes. You'd

04:40.133 --> 04:44.859
have the transportation hyphen planner, the 
health hyphen planner, the whatever hyphen

04:40.133 --> 04:44.859
planner. But who are the planner planners? That's 
the question you're asking. Where have they gone?

04:51.513 --> 04:54.816
Are we training any today in the universities? 
What is your perception of the recent grads from

04:54.836 --> 05:04.386
the Texas planning schools? Well, most of them are 
specialists, and that's fine. I've not been very

05:10.492 --> 05:14.175
impressed with them. I have interviewed a number 
of people, They're very intense about what

05:17.298 --> 05:27.350
they're doing, but they're very myopic about what

05:17.298 --> 05:27.350
they're doing. It reminds me of engineers a little 
bit.

05:33.638 --> 05:37.763
You know, you give somebody a situation and then 
they'll say, well, what they need is this service.

05:37.803 --> 05:44.031
They may not need that service, but that's what 
they were taught to do. A health plan. Well, they

05:45.593 --> 05:46.714
need dental care. Low-income people need dental 
care. Low-income people need money. They don't

05:50.614 --> 05:51.515
need dental care. Fuck the dental care. Go get the 
money as it is. That's the kind of thing. I think

05:57.422 --> 06:00.045
people don't cut through the bullshit. I think 
we've become isolated unto ourselves with our own

06:00.886 --> 06:15.705
little vocabulary at a time when you've got to 
explain to people that a council person who may be a

06:00.886 --> 06:15.705
developer or maybe something doesn't understand 
the kinds of things that the planners talk about.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.069
And I think you pick up vocabularies. I speak HUD, a 
little EPA, and a little EDA. But they're very

06:26.854 --> 06:28.315
different dialects. And I think we need to get the 
whole planning profession in general needs to get

06:29.957 --> 06:35.282
down a little bit. And be political. And know what 
you're doing. Be able to explain. And know in your

06:46.128 --> 06:49.272
head and in your heart, you know, what you're 
doing. And be able to explain these things to

06:49.733 --> 06:51.174
people. Don't sit back and make recommendations 
because somebody said so. You know, but I would

06:55.400 --> 07:07.455
much rather see a more general

06:55.400 --> 07:07.455
plan or come out of some of these things. Because I 
feel all of us were. I don't think anybody had any

07:09.558 --> 07:12.962
special drinking beer, you know. But I think most 
of the people that I know are doing quite well. And

07:17.286 --> 07:18.908
we might get into a specialty. We might not. There 
have been three or four of us that have gotten

07:20.269 --> 07:25.916
straight into management positions. And nobody 
ever thought about being a city manager. Far be it

07:29.961 --> 07:34.867
for me to think about being an executive assistant 
to the mayor of Houston. Or like, found out, didn't

07:34.907 --> 07:37.269
know. City manager. Right. Crabtree's assistant 
city manager.

07:43.705 --> 07:46.408
There are several others, which I can't think of 
right now. Well, Dana Bennett, sure. Right, Dana

07:47.730 --> 07:50.393
Bennett. You know, but you're not going to have a 
unimodal transportation planner going anywhere

07:51.254 --> 07:59.825
except on the staff of that operation. And they're 
just other things to be considered. And I think a

08:02.368 --> 08:13.662
good comprehensive, not comprehensive, I never 
use that word, a general planning base where you

08:02.368 --> 08:13.662
learn the planning process and then go on if you 
want an area of specialization seems to me to be the

08:14.553 --> 08:17.998
route to go. Otherwise, you know, other than slugs 
on somebody's staff, the goddamn lawyers are

08:18.078 --> 08:25.448
going to run it. You're saying it's dangerous to 
tie an educational program into current federal

08:25.508 --> 08:32.437
mandated funded projects. Absolutely. Because, 
I mean, look, the transportation bills weren't

08:33.138 --> 08:36.442
funded. You know, all of a sudden, 701 went away. 
And then 208. 208 screwed up. So everybody's

08:44.270 --> 08:49.218
gearing to these federal programs rather than 
taking an overall view. Because you can learn the

08:49.258 --> 08:50.801
vocabulary. I mean, it doesn't take you very long. 
Well, this all gets back to the role of higher

08:53.666 --> 08:59.235
education in the professions.

09:02.160 --> 09:08.691
Rick, thanks very much for your time and your 
careful consideration to these questions

09:09.110 --> 09:15.257
involving the planning process as we have come to 
know it in Houston. And I want to thank you for the

09:15.277 --> 09:27.330
Texas chapter of the American Planning 
Association and for the Texas A&M University

09:15.277 --> 09:27.330
Department of Regional Planning. And we look 
forward to seeing you visit us in the near future.

09:31.674 --> 09:32.215
Thank you.
