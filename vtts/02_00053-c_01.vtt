WEBVTT

00:01.972 --> 00:02.754
Go ahead. You were talking about the problem. We 
probably had 20 somewhat significant things in 27

00:08.104 --> 00:14.377
years, and that's nothing. The story I was going to 
relate is we had a gentleman who had worked for us

00:14.397 --> 00:21.972
for probably four or five years while we were in 
school here. He went to Kentucky. He had still yet

00:28.870 --> 00:32.216
to graduate, I think. He went to Kentucky and was 
working in their program. He was going to work in

00:34.720 --> 00:37.986
their program because his wife was working full 
time for them. And he went out to officiate his

00:39.603 --> 00:41.945
first night of intramurals. And he called us in 
that night. He called Mike, who he worked with

00:46.270 --> 00:47.371
here. Mike was a full-time staff member. He called 
Mike. He says, it's a war zone up here. I can't

00:53.457 --> 00:55.639
believe how many fights we've had. And our kids 
take their sport seriously. But just like I was

00:59.303 --> 01:04.088
saying early on, they respect the game itself. 
They respect the people. we we have an opportunity

01:07.750 --> 01:22.654
for students to handle protests all the way 
there's an appeals process all the way up to the

01:07.750 --> 01:22.654
president really But one of the intermediate 
steps is to what we call the recreational course

01:23.528 --> 01:28.956
advisory committee. We haven't heard a protest in 
three or four years. And we've done better at

01:33.663 --> 01:39.312
accommodating and handling things on site, which 
is where it should be handled. But we always want to

01:39.332 --> 01:41.655
have that avenue of appeals there. You know, I can 
remember when we first started here, we'd have

01:42.412 --> 01:46.799
one, two cases a week. In Austin, when I was there, 
we had three hours of cases every week. Every week.

01:54.230 --> 01:56.234
It never stopped. And it has just dwindled. Part of 
it is we're looking better at handling things

01:58.277 --> 02:00.681
on-site. Part of it is, you know, our kids are just 
so good about working with us. Ever had a mama or a

02:06.450 --> 02:09.955
daddy call you, ask for a special favor? Not 
really, not really. It's not like a necessity of

02:13.485 --> 02:21.281
life, like the rest is all wrong or something. 
Yeah, yeah. Have there been any missed, now that

02:23.726 --> 02:28.535
you look back, any opportunities that were 
missed? Yeah, there was probably various times

02:29.838 --> 02:32.483
that I wish we had built this building earlier, but 
in retrospect, I'm glad we waited, because we

02:32.969 --> 02:38.096
learned a lot from other people. I mean, the missed 
opportunity was for all those students in the

02:38.817 --> 02:50.754
meantime that didn't have the opportunity to be in 
this facility, because what we had back then was by

02:38.817 --> 02:50.754
no means close to accommodating their need. And 
that showed up when we went from 250,000

02:51.695 --> 02:56.702
participations to 1,250,000. That's how huge the 
need was. We kind of knew it was there. We didn't

03:00.848 --> 03:02.250
think it was quite that big. And again, if you were 
building this building today, there are not many

03:03.226 --> 03:08.992
changes you'd make, if any. The only thing I, the 
only thing, one of the things that we tried very

03:10.574 --> 03:20.665
hard to do was to understand what facilities we 
had, what facilities we need, because there was a

03:10.574 --> 03:20.665
limit on money. And we tried to handle that. What 
we're seeing now is those facilities over there

03:23.308 --> 03:26.972
are are being remodeled into classrooms and 
laboratories will lose some space and we're

03:27.307 --> 03:35.701
probably going to have to add out here. But that's 
happened over time. We didn't know that was going

03:37.103 --> 03:41.631
to happen at that point in time. All right. I'm 
nearing the downside in terms of questions I can

03:41.871 --> 03:48.943
think of. Who are the key staff associates that 
you, over this 27 years, that you would want to

03:49.835 --> 03:57.485
thank most? Tom Reber. Tom Reber. R-E? R-E-B-E-R.

04:07.218 --> 04:08.880
He's my senior associate director now. He hasn't 
been here the longest, but he's really... He has a

04:16.852 --> 04:18.754
commitment to the profession. He has a commitment 
to Aggies in a big way. He's done an outstanding

04:21.957 --> 04:23.459
job. James Walford, who's been here the longest. 
Then Rick Hall, just celebrating, starting his

04:28.244 --> 04:32.748
21st or 22nd year.

04:36.032 --> 04:38.775
And Rick's doing an outstanding job for us now. 
Paula Opal. How do you spell that name? O-P-A-L.

04:47.345 --> 04:55.478
Mike Walter,

04:47.345 --> 04:55.478
James Nash, you can kind of go down the list. 
There's

04:55.558 --> 05:04.271
probably 15 people that have been here 12 or more 
years. All right, what about people outside the

05:04.291 --> 05:09.520
intramural force that you would? There's some 
other people that were here, Jim Jeter. Jim Jeter

05:12.640 --> 05:21.695
was an assistant director then an associate 
director and then he went to the association of

05:12.640 --> 05:21.695
former students, was with them for a long time. He 
gave us a lot. Tom Weiss was here and then went up to

05:26.403 --> 05:28.987
Texas Tech.

05:33.014 --> 05:34.176
Somebody have a message here?

05:38.155 --> 05:42.519
All right, and then the administrator types that 
you most would want to thank. John Colas, Carl

05:43.440 --> 05:47.524
Landis. Carl Landis is probably number one. He was 
a very special person. It was his decision to bring

05:54.170 --> 06:03.620
me here, and thank goodness he saw past my long hair 
that I was okay. But John Colas, Maryland

06:03.640 --> 06:07.183
Southerners. fantastic support since we since he 
came in things are really going smooth with him as

06:07.855 --> 06:26.843
our as our leader

06:07.855 --> 06:26.843
chuck mccann was for all the stuff that he did when 
he was in the vice president's office We would have

06:28.308 --> 06:38.144
had a hard time, both Carl Landis and I, and Leonard 
Ponder trying to get recreation and physical

06:28.308 --> 06:38.144
education happening without his support. We 
would have run out of space. Now, you and I would

06:40.711 --> 06:49.343
both agree, too, if we were a jury, we could accuse 
Chuck McCandless of being a biased observer. Of

06:49.623 --> 06:52.727
course he is. We like that. That's right. Let's 
see. Let's make believe now that you're the

06:59.376 --> 07:03.462
consultant that has been brought in to look 
forward for intramurals here at Texas A&M? What

07:07.728 --> 07:12.654
advice would you give to anyone regarding the 
future here?

07:20.345 --> 07:23.509
I think the groundwork is pretty well laid here. 
many people say that we have the best program and

07:24.282 --> 07:49.598
the best facility in the country i think what we 
have to guard against is complacency and i think i

07:24.282 --> 07:49.598
think this staff has to continue to ask students 
what it is that they need they have to continue to

07:24.282 --> 07:49.598
look outside of this realm and see what is good and 
what is happening i think they need to evaluate the

07:24.282 --> 07:49.598
needs for indoor facilities in relationship to 
what's happening with some of the other

07:49.882 --> 07:53.869
facilities we use. Do we add on to this facility or 
build satellite facilities? Some of those

07:58.939 --> 08:00.903
questions we're talking about right now. We need 
to continue to upgrade our outdoor facilities

08:01.624 --> 08:06.373
because they're not up to this standard. And we 
need to And the whole benchmarking thing is part of

08:14.418 --> 08:22.956
showing others what we probably already know.

08:27.044 --> 08:30.992
But that's important that you have the 
documentation for that. Okay, next last

08:32.390 --> 08:34.052
question. Let's make believe that someone walked 
up to you and gave you a check for a million dollars

08:34.933 --> 08:40.000
with one requirement. You must pass it on to A&M, 
but you decide what use would be made. What would

08:45.006 --> 08:46.307
you want that? In other

08:46.928 --> 08:57.862
words, if you could make a very meaningful gift to 
A&M, for what purpose would you want that gift

08:46.928 --> 08:57.862
used? Anything.

09:09.717 --> 09:15.704
You know, in reality, it's still the most 
important place to put money in these

09:09.717 --> 09:15.704
universities and scholarships. Okay. For how do 
you select ? Oh, it's still the most important. I

09:26.535 --> 09:34.043
just had an executive director search for student 
financial aid, and that's still the most

09:26.535 --> 09:34.043
important place. The students who We have the 
ability, but not the money for tenure. That's the

09:39.900 --> 09:42.003
most important question. The rest of us can... I 
think our students will

09:46.990 --> 10:01.708
endow this

09:46.990 --> 10:01.708
facility with their trust and their money in the 
future. I don't think that's something we need to

10:01.728 --> 10:03.671
worry about. That was a good line. Use that. Use 
that. Endow this with their trust. That's a good

10:13.172 --> 10:16.617
description of the feeling here. What feelings do 
you hold in your heart today for Texas A&M? It's the

10:23.006 --> 10:30.636
most important place in the world to me, other than 
my home.

10:36.252 --> 10:42.360
Texas A&M has given me a fantastic opportunity to 
do that. I think the work that I do is the most

10:44.462 --> 10:48.047
important work. And that's helping people to 
create a healthy lifestyle. I think the

10:54.255 --> 11:02.665
opportunity of doing that may be better than any of 
the physicians.

11:05.142 --> 11:09.589
It's given me the opportunity to express myself 
with very few limitations.

11:12.334 --> 11:23.873
It's the opportunity to deliver programs to them 
with very few limitations.

11:23.893 --> 11:31.065
I think we've kept that trust and for reasonable 
costs.

11:34.842 --> 11:43.174
I can't imagine anybody having a better run it at a 
job than I had. I plan on being here another 15 years

11:43.254 --> 11:47.179
too if my health holds up. Hopefully I'll be 
creative the whole time that I'm here. I've had the

11:51.085 --> 11:54.690
opportunity to

11:55.733 --> 12:09.336
to start with a good program and take it where I 
thought it needed to go based on my best and I've had

11:55.733 --> 12:09.336
the support of, without, I had support all the 27 
years. I anticipated the time to come. I don't know

12:12.602 --> 12:14.425
how much more you can ask out of a job than that. You 
know, I see to get to this point in their life when

12:20.455 --> 12:23.678
they're hoping to retire. I'm hoping to stay 
working. It's just too much fun. And that's the way

12:27.763 --> 12:30.646
it should be. That's the kind of thing we're trying 
to create here, too. But A&M has given me that. I'm

12:35.611 --> 12:37.293
not sure I could get that anyplace else. It's just a 
special place. It is an institution of higher

12:40.116 --> 12:48.285
education that has a family sense. that we're 
going to help each other and do for each other and if

12:48.552 --> 12:59.430
we work together, we can all be better. And that's 
just kind of what I feel about it. And that's where,

13:02.395 --> 13:06.662
you know, I probably didn't I didn't do this very 
well when I first came here, but after 25 years you

13:07.233 --> 13:14.184
get to the point where you can find, you can see wind 
winds. And that's been the real fun in the last few

13:15.206 --> 13:24.001
years is to see wind wind situations where other 
people see wind winds or nobody winds. And that's

13:24.161 --> 13:26.625
what's really becoming fun now.
