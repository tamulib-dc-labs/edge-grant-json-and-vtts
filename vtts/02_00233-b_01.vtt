00:01.938 --> 00:04.421
This is an interview with Norman Borlaug.

00:05.242 --> 00:09.707
Today's date is February 7th, 1986.

00:11.249 --> 00:18.959
This is a test.

00:18.979 --> 00:25.026
Last time, oh, today is February 7th, 1986.

00:25.411 --> 00:28.738
And this is another interview with Dr. Norman Borlaug.

00:29.119 --> 00:34.951
Last time we were talking about changes in the 1970s, and we talked about a number of them.

00:36.614 --> 00:41.083
And one of those is the development of tritracle.

00:42.526 --> 00:43.408
Triticale.

00:43.428 --> 00:44.731
Okay, triticale.

00:45.031 --> 00:45.833
Triticale.

00:47.905 --> 01:07.922
T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E T-R

01:08.695 --> 01:14.902
This has a long, painful process behind it.

01:15.042 --> 01:34.224
Way back in the 1890s, someone saw in a mixed field of wheat and rye, somewhere in Europe, I believe it was, something that looked like a cross between these, between rye and between wheat.

01:34.244 --> 01:36.947
The head was bigger.

01:38.311 --> 01:46.020
It turned out that despite the vigor of the plant, the grain was shriveled and formed.

01:46.040 --> 01:50.365
And now on the basis of what's known, this was a natural cross.

01:51.106 --> 02:04.521
And apparently, but when you make this cross, you get a seed that you plant.

02:05.024 --> 02:11.196
That plant in turn will be almost, if not entirely sterile.

02:11.216 --> 02:12.819
It won't produce seed.

02:12.839 --> 02:13.601
It'll have a big hit.

02:13.621 --> 02:16.206
It'll look beautiful.

02:16.226 --> 02:19.472
But once in a while,

02:21.629 --> 02:29.799
And the reason for this is that you have these sets of chromosomes from the Y and the wheat and they're not compatible.

02:30.199 --> 02:32.842
Like a dog and a cat in the same room.

02:32.862 --> 02:33.823
They won't breathe.

02:33.843 --> 02:35.886
They won't cross.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.989
And so each one goes in its own corner.

02:39.009 --> 02:47.299
And the result is that what should become a grain never sets in that.

02:48.022 --> 02:49.124
first hybrid plant.

02:49.504 --> 02:54.892
That is, you get the cross seed, you plant it, and quite often you get a plant.

02:54.912 --> 02:57.736
But the next generation, there's no seed.

02:57.756 --> 03:01.401
It's the same old story of the mule.

03:02.262 --> 03:08.431
The mule, you know, is a cross between a horse and a donkey, or an ass.

03:08.451 --> 03:13.017
But with the exception of one that was supposed to have

03:13.773 --> 03:17.817
been made fertile by hormones at Cornell about two years ago.

03:17.837 --> 03:23.243
No one has ever seen a colt or a young animal born from a mule.

03:24.425 --> 03:28.049
So you have these incompatibilities.

03:28.669 --> 03:43.105
But no one could even make these plants artificially because they were difficult to cross until about 1936 when

03:44.114 --> 04:00.779
and I think one of the first was done, and his name is gone right now, was at Iowa State, a cytogeneticist who moved on later to Penn State, crossed wheat and rye.

04:01.540 --> 04:13.378
And then by that time it was known that a certain extract from the spring crocus

04:14.017 --> 04:28.456
which is an alkaloid, when you put it at the right concentration on the growing tip of this new seedling, it would not affect chromosome division.

04:28.656 --> 04:29.958
They would go ahead and divide.

04:30.779 --> 04:39.110
But what should have become two cells in the apical growing point, the cell wall was never laid down.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.593
It interfered with cell wall deposition.

04:42.569 --> 04:48.797
The result was then the sets of the wheat chromosomes divided, duplicated themselves.

04:49.017 --> 04:52.281
The rye ones did also.

04:52.301 --> 04:56.766
And each one set of each should have gone into the new cell.

04:57.127 --> 05:10.784
But in this case, since there was no new cell division laid down or cell wall, you ended up with two sets of wheat, two sets of rye in that growing point.

05:10.804 --> 05:11.985
And when this happens,

05:12.235 --> 05:15.259
Then you will get partial seed.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.182
You'll get seed produced.

05:17.903 --> 05:20.687
So you can propagate this thing.

05:22.150 --> 05:27.397
There were several people who spent their lifetime trying from 1936 onward.

05:31.904 --> 05:37.592
Especially Sanchez Monque, a Spaniard who's still alive.

05:38.954 --> 05:40.556
How would you spell that?

05:40.577 --> 05:41.618
S-A-N-C-H-T.

05:42.053 --> 06:00.035
M-O-N-G-I-E, and Arne Munzing, M-U-N-Z-I-N-G, from Sweden, who passed away several years ago.

06:00.736 --> 06:10.288
They spent their career trying to make this into a commercial crop, but there were great difficulties.

06:11.078 --> 06:21.173
they got so that they could produce these seedlings that would produce some seeds so you could perpetuate it and you could select and improve it.

06:21.814 --> 06:24.999
But the progress was painfully slow.

06:28.024 --> 06:31.028
I first got interested in it in 19...

06:31.767 --> 06:42.458
Let's see, 1958 at the first international wheat genetic symposium in Winnipeg, Canada.

06:42.478 --> 06:57.893
When I saw it growing in what they called the Living Herbarium, they had a great collection of wheats for this international symposium.

06:58.565 --> 07:06.855
And it was there where we had some of the first semi-dwarf Mexican wheat that were growing there as exhibits.

07:07.837 --> 07:15.286
This was before they had become commercial, of course.

07:15.306 --> 07:18.991
They were still kind of ragged, but they were impressive.

07:19.011 --> 07:22.395
And right beside them were these tremendously

07:23.607 --> 07:39.887
headed criticalist that Dr. Shebesky, S-H-E-V-I-S-K-I, who was the dean, Len Shebesky, dean at the University of Manitoba, had brought together.

07:39.907 --> 07:44.873
And I looked at this, and my colleague, the late Joe Rupert,

07:45.072 --> 07:46.573
We were pretty impressed.

07:46.593 --> 07:53.039
We had seen some of these big sterile heads when we were graduate students, but I'd never seen the plant grow.

07:54.800 --> 08:14.117
And so Joe Rupert, who was then in charge of our weed program in Chile, arranged to get a few of these triticales to take with him to Chile, and he began to work on them because we in Mexico were up to our eyeballs trying to

08:14.840 --> 08:19.065
overcome many of these problems that still existed in these dwarf weeds.

08:19.265 --> 08:26.274
The grain was riveled and the disease resistance was not adequate, although they were very promising.

08:26.294 --> 08:33.663
See, in 58, it was about four years before the first commercial variety came out of the semi-dwar.

08:33.683 --> 08:44.796
And so Joe worked on these for about, Joe Rupert, for about, oh, I guess four or five years.

08:45.164 --> 09:11.914
when we were finally getting to a point where the wheat was going pretty good he sent us some of these back to Mexico and we began to work on it and it so happened that these plants would grow most of them were developed in northern climates in other words with long days

09:12.265 --> 09:15.989
As I pointed out, we got our first docks from Canada.

09:16.009 --> 09:30.786
But he was using primarily the ones from Spain, from Sanchez Monti, and from Moonsingh from Sweden, plus some new ones that he had made, that Chavesky had made.

09:30.806 --> 09:37.834
And when you grew these under Mexican conditions, it was like the Canadian weeds or the northern spring weeds.

09:38.455 --> 09:40.678
They're poorly adapted to the short days.

09:40.838 --> 09:44.382
That means they keep growing, growing, growing, growing, taller and taller.

09:45.324 --> 09:48.648
They never want to mature.

09:48.668 --> 09:51.311
But we had a lot of these grown.

09:51.351 --> 09:53.914
We were working with them.

09:53.934 --> 09:55.136
We were crossing them too.

09:56.157 --> 10:07.551
And in 1950, no, in 19... We saw...

10:08.189 --> 10:10.111
some reasonably good progress.

10:10.171 --> 10:13.315
We have been able to shorten them down.

10:15.097 --> 10:20.343
But the sterility or partial sterility in shrivel seed was still a bad problem.

10:20.363 --> 10:22.305
They were too late in maturity.

10:25.950 --> 10:35.901
It so happened that in 19, I suppose, 19,

10:36.522 --> 10:53.419
We had had a large number of these critticales, mostly sterile, poor types, but they were surrounded by all the fields of our breeding material in wheat.

10:53.439 --> 11:06.512
What must have happened was that with tongue-in-cheek, I always say this, some of my colleagues at that time

11:08.028 --> 11:34.002
dim point of view of expressing it that way, but I said, apparently some night when we were still asleep, some of these pretty aggressive little dwarf pollen grain from these dwarf Mexican weeds flying around and found a promiscuous tall triticale, and they crossed.

11:35.197 --> 11:38.121
And we were selecting many plants.

11:38.141 --> 11:39.083
We didn't see this.

11:39.103 --> 11:46.774
No evidence of this.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.035
They were regrown and multiplied.

11:48.055 --> 11:59.652
And then in the spring, or in the, yes, in the spring, so we must have selected them again in the fall of 67 and in the spring of 68, when I came back from

12:00.138 --> 12:19.553
I should say that, in the fall of 67, we had in Toluca Valley, which is close to Mexico City, High Valley, about five acres, at least tall, mostly late, but once in a while there was a short one in there.

12:21.717 --> 12:24.542
Most of them sterile, you'd just feel the head and it was empty.

12:25.552 --> 12:43.240
So after we'd finished all the wheat, selecting the wheat plants, I had about seven graduate students, mostly from Pakistan and Egypt, Argentina.

12:43.591 --> 12:47.555
I said, all right, we only got this half day to go through all of this.

12:47.635 --> 12:48.876
Most of it is garbage.

12:49.477 --> 13:00.748
So I had one rather experienced Argentinian with me, and I said, you take three of them over there, these young people, one on either side, two on one side.

13:00.768 --> 13:04.532
I have two on each side, and we go down through so many rows.

13:04.552 --> 13:08.777
Look at the healthy plants, but don't pull them out.

13:08.797 --> 13:09.597
It's too much work.

13:09.637 --> 13:11.880
Just feel if they've got grain in them.

13:12.080 --> 13:12.180
Yeah.

13:12.869 --> 13:17.114
It was just a slip shot way through it.

13:17.134 --> 13:28.747
We pulled out all of these plants, dried them, and by the time the harvest was finished, I left for India or Pakistan.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.868
Did any of them have grain?

13:30.769 --> 13:31.009
Yes.

13:31.850 --> 13:33.772
It was shrift.

13:33.892 --> 13:40.800
But my colleagues took them to

13:41.489 --> 13:46.001
By then I had two people who were going to work on tree kenny.

13:46.803 --> 13:53.581
One was there during the harvest but had left before we got to this.

13:53.861 --> 13:58.333
He was Canadian, Frank Zielinski.

13:59.056 --> 14:13.849
carried on this program for a number of years.

14:13.869 --> 14:18.033
And the other one was George Vargas, carrying Portuguese name, but he's from South India, from the old Goan enclave, originally.

14:18.053 --> 14:27.021
And so they planted these, and in the spring again, after spending some time in Sonora,

14:27.237 --> 14:29.319
for pollinating the wheat.

14:29.339 --> 14:30.781
I left for India and Pakistan.

14:31.161 --> 14:39.891
And when I came back to the experiment station in Sonora, I drove into the station.

14:39.911 --> 14:41.513
There was Zelensky and Barghese.

14:41.713 --> 14:49.161
Before I could turn off the motor on my car, they practically pulled me out and they said, come and see what we've got.

14:50.422 --> 14:51.263
There they were.

14:51.483 --> 14:53.886
There were seven short rows of

14:54.203 --> 14:59.269
Triticales, completely fertile, all the heads on every plant.

14:59.289 --> 15:02.012
Then there were another 20 that were segregating.

15:02.032 --> 15:09.440
In other words, some plants were completely fertile and others were completely sterile.

15:09.460 --> 15:12.523
Of course, when we thrashed the grain, it was all shriveled.

15:13.645 --> 15:16.187
Some less so.

15:16.207 --> 15:22.995
But those plants that had that complete fertility had acquired several other important characteristics.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.987
One, they were semi-dwarf.

15:26.207 --> 15:28.350
They'd inherited the dwarfing gene.

15:28.370 --> 15:28.691
Sure.

15:28.931 --> 15:31.535
Along with the fertility.

15:32.957 --> 15:50.282
And they were a month earlier than those tall Canadian triticales we started out, indicating that whatever that semi-dwarf Mexican week was, it must have been rather short, maybe even a triple dwarf, or at least a double dwarf.

15:51.224 --> 15:58.975
that was early maturing and that had the ability to restore the fertility.

16:00.677 --> 16:03.341
So then we began an active program, dressing.

16:03.742 --> 16:06.926
Both of these people worked for a number of years on this.

16:07.907 --> 16:13.696
Our guest was moved to Africa on the wheat program, and Savinsky carried on.

16:13.756 --> 16:16.860
To make a long story short,

16:18.275 --> 16:30.411
It was a long, painful agony to try to change the grain filling, that is the plumpness, the test weight, the milling quality.

16:30.431 --> 16:36.559
But gradually they have been getting better.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.241
They have the ability to grow

16:38.592 --> 16:41.236
on acid soil, poor soils.

16:41.256 --> 16:42.478
Yeah, that's what I want to talk about.

16:42.498 --> 16:43.059
Poor soils.

16:43.239 --> 16:44.982
That's what I want to talk about.

16:45.102 --> 16:47.325
Yeah, I want to find out, well, what are the benefits?

16:47.345 --> 16:48.266
All right.

16:48.286 --> 16:50.109
I mean, why do we want this to begin with?

16:50.430 --> 16:50.770
All right.

16:52.533 --> 17:05.813
First of all, rye has the ability to grow on soils that wheat grow poorly on, especially acid soils, sandy soils.

17:06.454 --> 17:07.435
In rye,

17:08.140 --> 17:28.480
From a nutritional standpoint, even though it's still debated as to what the real cost is, there's a toxic substance or a substance that affects the nutritional value.

17:28.501 --> 17:36.949
For example, in chickens or in monogastric animals like swine, if you add more than

17:38.009 --> 17:57.402
In the case of poultry, 68% egg production goes down, the body weight increase drops down, and swine it also cuts back on the growth rate, and the body weight gain.

17:57.787 --> 18:01.770
Then why doesn't this happen in human beings?

18:01.790 --> 18:14.421
The reason is that when you bake it in bread, you destroy whatever this metabolite is that affects the physiology of the monogastric animal.

18:14.441 --> 18:20.166
When we began to analyze these crosses, some of these weeds didn't have this.

18:20.246 --> 18:26.612
These trinicales seem to have better nutritional quality by far than the

18:27.385 --> 18:38.512
And considerably better for certain test animals than wheat.

18:39.514 --> 18:42.441
Also these plants have tremendous vigor.

18:42.758 --> 19:03.417
although there were many things wrong with them and so we finally got vigor in the sense of growing the plants yeah grow vigorous okay fast growers faster than wheat or rye and we began to test them also for forage production for grazing or for hay

19:03.397 --> 19:11.187
And the total amount of dry weight produced, some of them, indicated that they had good potential there also.

19:11.247 --> 19:15.313
So we started making a lot of crosses, sending materials around to collaborators.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.795
So in other words, they were easier.

19:16.935 --> 19:18.136
They could go back to about 70.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.759
They could be grown in porous soil.

19:20.019 --> 19:24.084
They had potentially higher nutritional value, and they grew faster.

19:25.406 --> 19:28.730
They grew more vigorously, let's say.

19:28.831 --> 19:30.653
You could see the seedings.

19:30.953 --> 19:33.419
jumped out of the ground and grew rapidly.

19:34.382 --> 19:41.841
But when you start with a crude species like this, it's highly improbable that you will make them.

19:42.293 --> 19:44.295
tremendous progress overnight.

19:44.996 --> 19:53.906
The euphoria now of biotechnology should take a lesson from the long struggle we've had in triticale.

19:54.787 --> 19:58.371
These things don't change overnight.

19:58.451 --> 20:11.406
And there's been a tremendous amount of publicity about what's coming from all of the new biotechnology, genetic engineering, and in some cases there have been substantial things that have

20:11.892 --> 20:36.111
are coming to the fore in medicine, better antibiotics, insulin produced by genetic engineering, which doesn't have the disadvantage of the side reactions that you get, insulin that's taken from the organs of swine, which used to be one of the main sources.

20:36.462 --> 20:40.129
from the slaughterhouse, if you will.

20:40.149 --> 20:42.653
So there are things that are happening.

20:43.114 --> 20:57.880
And I think that some of the things that look very promising, like the growth hormones in animals, offer a great deal of problems.

20:58.923 --> 21:12.217
But that doesn't mean that all of this biotechnology is suddenly going to change wheat production or corn production or rice production or any of our major crop species.

21:13.378 --> 21:25.470
Certain things that are spun off from this, although they preceded the so-called biotechnology that has its label today, this ability to

21:26.648 --> 21:54.073
use hormones to stimulate multiple ovulation in, let's say, beef cattle, so that rather than one of them coming down, there are several hormone injections and then artificial semination, then recovering that fertilized egg in a few days at the right stage.

21:54.340 --> 21:58.766
and transplanted to other cows that are low grade.

21:58.786 --> 22:03.872
But this would be used on unusually good dams and sires.

22:05.474 --> 22:12.083
And so you could recover several eggs at each fertilization.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.105
And this might go on several times a year.

22:14.566 --> 22:24.178
And now they've even got so that they can, at the early stage, split one of those four fertilized eggs

22:24.732 --> 22:29.037
into four and get four calves transplanted like that.

22:29.057 --> 22:33.221
Now that's been done experimentally, not on a commercial base.

22:33.402 --> 22:45.575
But they can transplant these multiple fertilized eggs to other surrogate cows and raise the calf.

22:45.595 --> 22:51.702
And the calf, of course, is like its mother genetically, true mother, and like the bull.

22:52.610 --> 23:07.793
And even though the surrogate mother is the one that nourished it in her innards during the whole period, genetically she has nothing in common.

23:07.813 --> 23:11.258
So there are many things that will come like this, but how did I get off on that track?

23:13.441 --> 23:20.271
The point is that we have now worked pretty intensively for, from 68

23:21.652 --> 23:23.134
So 86.

23:25.336 --> 23:26.157
That's a long time.

23:26.177 --> 23:28.120
68, 78.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.001
18 years.

23:29.021 --> 23:29.902
18 years.

23:29.922 --> 23:31.704
36 growing seasons.

23:32.204 --> 23:32.485
Right.

23:33.025 --> 23:35.688
And we have seen a lot of progress.

23:35.709 --> 23:49.785
Now, some of these triticales, when they're compared to wheat under certain conditions, produce as much as or more than the best wheat.

23:50.795 --> 23:53.359
Even the best one has still got problems.

23:53.459 --> 23:56.123
The straw is too weak, even though they're short.

23:56.384 --> 23:59.989
Or the short ones, the grain is still too shriveled.

24:00.650 --> 24:03.956
We have others where the grain is good and plump.

24:04.036 --> 24:12.068
Many of the grains from these new triticale sprout in the head if it's rainy at time of harvest.

24:12.088 --> 24:14.372
And of course that destroys the value.

24:14.673 --> 24:19.557
both from the standpoint of bread making or any other use.

24:19.577 --> 24:22.220
That is gradually being corrected.

24:22.240 --> 24:29.446
And probably we've collaborated with quite a few countries.

24:29.466 --> 24:41.017
My own personal belief is that Poland will probably become the first country to use these triticalis on a big commercial scale.

24:41.037 --> 24:43.279
We've had good collaboration with

24:44.390 --> 24:50.216
Dr. Wolski, their chief geneticist.

24:50.236 --> 24:53.040
He's visited us many times, and we've visited him.

24:53.060 --> 24:53.720
Why Holland?

24:53.760 --> 25:04.172
I mean, besides personnel, I mean, Holland has good soil, and it has plenty of rainfall, and it has... All right, let me tell you, Poland, because of this.

25:04.192 --> 25:05.213
Oh, Holland or Poland?

25:05.233 --> 25:05.513
Poland.

25:05.654 --> 25:06.434
Oh, Poland.

25:06.454 --> 25:07.436
I thought you said Holland.

25:07.456 --> 25:08.897
No, Poland.

25:08.917 --> 25:10.479
Okay.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.143
It produces seven million tons of rye.

25:15.743 --> 25:27.897
That rye can mostly only be used for bread because of these toxic metabolites, whatever they have.

25:29.530 --> 25:34.457
Their main interest in meat is swain.

25:34.758 --> 25:35.899
So they got real problems.

25:36.480 --> 25:42.188
It's too far north with the present corn varieties to grow corn.

25:42.949 --> 25:52.543
They got themselves into this economic crisis when they were importing large quantities of corn and soybeans.

25:52.683 --> 25:59.453
They had developed a very large poultry industry because they like chicken meat also.

26:00.479 --> 26:07.831
And part of this was used for swine.

26:08.291 --> 26:17.686
The main base of food feed for their swine production has always been potatoes, boiled or steamed potatoes.

26:19.790 --> 26:27.482
But you have to supplement this with protein, and so the soybean was the main source, but some from corn.

26:27.817 --> 26:40.535
But then when their military government, when they got removed from the favored trading partner, the whole poultry industry collapsed.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.718
Because they couldn't import from the United States.

26:43.800 --> 26:50.309
And the swine production has gone down greatly.

26:50.449 --> 26:54.235
Because they imported corn from us?

26:55.516 --> 26:55.917
Right.

26:56.622 --> 27:00.629
And so they're moving forward as fast as possible.

27:00.649 --> 27:12.207
When I was there a couple of times in 1982, they had one of these out in preliminary multiplication, one of these triticaleys.

27:12.227 --> 27:16.234
But it was an unusually cold winter and in some places the winter

27:16.754 --> 27:18.797
injury was quite severe.

27:19.477 --> 27:32.413
But it had been tested and was being tested not only in Poland, but in Western Germany, France, England, Holland, and all of those countries.

27:32.433 --> 27:36.398
And in those countries, winter was not so severe.

27:37.720 --> 27:38.621
They did very well.

27:39.943 --> 27:45.850
And it's being grown commercially in some of those countries, still on a rather modest scale.

27:46.268 --> 27:52.554
But now Wolski has got two new ones in multiplication that have better frost resistance.

27:52.874 --> 27:58.759
And I think within two or three years there will be substantial acreages.

27:58.919 --> 28:13.913
Australia has gone into rather sizable production of some of these as a feed grain because they do better than wheat.

28:14.635 --> 28:17.379
poor barley on some of the poor soils.

28:17.399 --> 28:24.588
And there's several hundred thousand acres.

28:24.608 --> 28:29.094
Argentina is starting to multiply a couple.

28:29.115 --> 28:38.327
They have also resistance to certain diseases, bettering resistance.

28:38.347 --> 28:44.355
For example, one of the smuts that's not an important problem worldwide, but it's called Carnal Bund.

28:44.960 --> 28:49.787
It's a minor disease, but one we know very little about.

28:50.509 --> 28:58.781
It's indigenous to India, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, most of the near Middle East.

28:59.582 --> 29:00.584
We've got it in Mexico.

29:00.624 --> 29:02.166
We've had it for a long time.

29:02.186 --> 29:04.089
How it moved around, we don't know.

29:04.109 --> 29:07.795
It has to have a special climate to survive.

29:07.775 --> 29:19.607
But most all of the wheat varieties are susceptible when ecological conditions are favorable for infection.

29:19.627 --> 29:26.935
So this may also help you to find another niche that will help promote it.

29:26.955 --> 29:33.782
Now the question is, will it become a crop to

29:34.336 --> 29:36.278
supplement the other small grains.

29:36.819 --> 29:39.802
My own feeling is there's enough evidence now that it will.

29:39.822 --> 29:49.714
How soon it will occupy that position because of these advantages I've mentioned remains to be seen.

29:52.617 --> 30:01.407
The original financing for this crop when we became involved came from this source.

30:03.192 --> 30:23.558
The Canadian financing was in an endowed chair at the University of Manitoba, and it came from the Bauchman family, which are really the owners of the Canadian distilleries.

30:23.579 --> 30:25.521
Anyway, this big distillery company.

30:26.294 --> 30:27.337
You mean, like beer?

30:28.038 --> 30:29.161
No, a ride.

30:29.542 --> 30:32.028
Oh, like Canadian Club, whiskey?

30:32.229 --> 30:33.672
Canadian Club, all of this.

30:33.693 --> 30:35.878
The Boston is the name of the company.

30:36.660 --> 30:37.502
I mean, of the family.

30:37.769 --> 30:41.454
And so their program was started from this endowed chair.

30:42.575 --> 30:49.845
And as Rupert and I looked at this, we weren't sure that we could justify spending any of our money.

30:49.865 --> 30:52.309
This was pre-Simmon.

30:52.329 --> 30:57.536
This was still Rock Color Foundation program in Mexico and Chile and Colombia.

30:58.657 --> 31:06.628
But we grabbed some of those seeds and Joe bootlegged it under the wheat.

31:07.452 --> 31:20.489
Then when he sent some of these back to me in 65 and I grew them in Mexico, I thought they were pretty impressive, still full of defects.

31:20.589 --> 31:25.275
So I went to the Rockefeller Foundation and I said, I think this is a horse that's worth betting.

31:26.116 --> 31:29.781
Why don't you give a little additional funds?

31:30.132 --> 31:33.757
University of Manitoba, and we will work with them.

31:33.777 --> 31:38.122
And I'm convinced enough, by then, Simit was coming into being.

31:38.142 --> 31:40.965
I'm convinced that it's got some merit.

31:40.986 --> 31:45.972
It should be studied, and I'll try to get a small budget in Simit.

31:45.992 --> 31:46.733
And this was done.

31:47.233 --> 31:48.975
That's the way we got started.

31:48.995 --> 31:55.764
Now, of course, this has been... And the Ford Foundation hired Zelinsky.

31:55.784 --> 31:58.668
He was the person who took over that.

31:58.688 --> 31:59.869
He spent...

32:00.524 --> 32:11.881
I guess about ten years before you retired on that program, under Ford Foundation sponsorship, but attached to SIMIT.

32:11.901 --> 32:18.651
Now, of course, the financing is under the general SIMIT budget, which means the whole

32:19.103 --> 32:30.595
So is that where the major research is being done now at CIMIT?

32:30.935 --> 32:34.219
But now there's a lot of research going on in certain other countries.

32:34.319 --> 32:40.265
For example, in Australia, in Poland, in Argentina.

32:40.285 --> 32:44.790
It's generated quite a bit of enthusiasm.

32:45.715 --> 32:51.827
The question always is asked, look, if it was so good, where are the results?

32:53.309 --> 33:04.230
My answer is, you know, when Neolithic women first domesticated wild wheat and wild barley and wild oats, not much happened probably for them.

33:04.497 --> 33:06.360
quite a few thousand years.

33:06.800 --> 33:10.366
And yet this has come this far in 18 years.

33:10.386 --> 33:19.559
So far that under certain conditions it can compete with wheat and have advantages which makes it more desirable.

33:19.579 --> 33:21.782
So give us a little time.

33:22.303 --> 33:29.493
But the point that I want to make also is that when you start in something entirely new, it takes time.

33:30.114 --> 33:32.057
And I go back again

33:32.729 --> 33:41.139
to the whole euphoria of biotechnology, genetic engineering, recombinant DNA.

33:41.880 --> 33:51.632
It's one thing in bacteria or lower forms of life where you can grow millions and billions of cells and turn them over in a few days' time.

33:52.193 --> 33:56.398
It's something entirely different when you can only grow two generations a year.

33:57.479 --> 33:59.682
And so the time frame

33:59.999 --> 34:10.952
that you'll have to work with in the higher plants, like our main commercial crops, or developing new commercial crops like Triticale.

34:12.574 --> 34:29.314
It's an agonizingly slow process, but progress is being made, and I hope to live to see, assuming they don't blow the whistle on me too soon, to see this become a substantial commercial crop to supplement

34:30.526 --> 34:42.220
wheat and other small grains for certain soil and ecological and climatological and perhaps nutritional uses.

34:42.401 --> 34:58.120
You know, we're talking about a really interesting topic that I wanted to get to eventually, and that is that whole idea of genetic manipulation and bioengineering and the hormone shots for animals to... Okay, if you want to do that on a different time, then we can...

34:58.100 --> 34:59.483
do it then.

34:59.643 --> 35:03.351
I just opened it up here not knowing whether you were interested.

35:03.371 --> 35:04.513
Oh yeah, I want to talk about that.

35:04.653 --> 35:06.217
I mean, would you like to address that now?

35:06.517 --> 35:13.432
I think it might be better if I kind of look through and get a little better focus in one of the later ones.

35:14.013 --> 35:14.374
Okay.

35:14.394 --> 35:16.137
We open the general picture here.

35:16.157 --> 35:18.522
Okay, okay, because those are topics that

35:18.502 --> 35:28.639
I mean, I have friends over in Agricultural Sciences, and they're doing all kinds of experiments on dairy production, and it's very interesting.

35:28.740 --> 35:31.865
The dairy production is very impressive.

35:32.887 --> 35:37.675
I've been visiting Professor Cornell for the last three years also.

35:37.655 --> 35:47.857
And I heard Bauman give his seminar when he first announced his fantastic results after completing a whole lactation cycle.

35:48.438 --> 35:50.442
I've forgotten the number of cows.

35:50.462 --> 35:52.647
But it was a sizable number.

35:52.667 --> 35:56.355
The most he could handle with the amounts of pure hormone that was available.

35:57.145 --> 36:06.339
And depending on the individual cow that was involved, the increased milk production was on the order of 30 to 38 percent.

36:06.479 --> 36:16.875
And yet with a surprisingly small reduction in body weight.

36:17.260 --> 36:25.172
I still don't understand all of its implications, how this is going about this.

36:25.192 --> 36:30.280
And after he'd made his presentation, it was very good, I was truly impressed.

36:30.300 --> 36:41.698
I said, Dr. Bowman, how much loss of body weight contributed to this increase in milk production?

36:42.218 --> 36:47.725
He says, it was not statistically significant.

36:47.745 --> 36:53.253
How much increase in food intake resulted from this?

36:53.273 --> 37:04.307
He said, again, it was marginal, but statistically, with the small number of animals that they were working with, not significantly.

37:04.327 --> 37:06.370
And I said, well, how do you explain this?

37:07.008 --> 37:15.641
He said, how did you explain this when you started working with those little short wheats and giving these results?

37:15.921 --> 37:17.704
I said, at that time, we didn't explain it.

37:19.006 --> 37:30.583
Now, of course, in the case of the wheat and the part, or these dwarf plants, more of the photosynthate goes into the grain than into growing all of that straw.

37:30.844 --> 37:36.492
That's in partitioning the photosynthes, photosynthate.

37:38.142 --> 37:59.661
And he says, well, maybe we have a small amount of this going on that might be part of the cow's fat storage, but it's marginal, that's been converted into milk, but there must have been a corresponding increase in muscle tissue in part, because otherwise you measure it in body weight changes.

38:00.333 --> 38:01.595
He says it's not clear.

38:01.735 --> 38:02.917
So they don't really know.

38:03.317 --> 38:06.321
But that's the way research on the frontier goes.

38:06.361 --> 38:09.546
You don't know what's going on a lot of times.

38:09.586 --> 38:11.589
You see the gross effect, but you don't know.

38:13.231 --> 38:28.753
You see in those dwarf weeds, when we were growing those, in the early part, nobody really knew what was going on.

38:31.619 --> 38:37.106
I guess that's the way we are in this milk situation with the animal corn bars.

38:37.126 --> 38:46.078
Okay, well, we'll talk about this another time, and we'll talk about this whole issue, because it has a lot of ethical issues that go right along with it.

38:46.940 --> 38:48.642
Just off the record, do you know Bob Blake?

38:49.643 --> 38:49.964
Blake?

38:50.945 --> 38:52.547
By name only.

38:52.828 --> 38:54.169
You'd like to meet him.

38:55.371 --> 38:56.553
He's doing that type of work here.

38:56.573 --> 38:57.854
He's a good friend of mine.

38:59.517 --> 39:00.638
But we'll talk about that later.

39:00.678 --> 39:01.339
I want to...

39:01.673 --> 39:18.602
change the topic then, there are a lot of newer organizations that were linked with CEMET during the 1970s and I'd like to talk about the organizational structure and how it changed and the cooperation or coordination between

39:18.886 --> 39:26.897
the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture, and the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations.

39:28.059 --> 39:29.080
How does it all relate?

39:29.140 --> 39:35.990
What kind of relationship did they have?

39:38.053 --> 39:44.522
Prior to 1970, the main forces

39:45.413 --> 39:58.774
behind foreign technical assistance programs in the higher concert were Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation was the primary organization.

39:58.794 --> 40:01.318
Ford Foundation seemed to join.

40:01.478 --> 40:06.966
Indirectly, mostly from a nutritional standpoint, also the Kellogg Foundation.

40:06.986 --> 40:08.769
They operated in a different way.

40:08.789 --> 40:10.792
They didn't have country programs.

40:10.812 --> 40:13.817
Mostly it was for fellowships and these sort of things.

40:13.797 --> 40:16.039
and USAID.

40:16.199 --> 40:24.307
USAID, let me go back to that, I don't know whether we covered this or not, the history of the Rockefeller program.

40:24.327 --> 40:28.131
It began in agriculture in 1943 in Mexico.

40:28.151 --> 40:28.812
Did we cover this?

40:28.832 --> 40:30.293
Yes, we have covered this.

40:30.854 --> 40:35.158
And we also have the other oral history that was done, that was done by, yeah, we have that.

40:35.338 --> 40:35.919
All right.

40:35.939 --> 40:42.285
Then just to stick in the timing sequence here.

40:42.265 --> 40:49.474
That program you see preceded the Marshall Plan by about

40:49.910 --> 40:59.560
six, seven years, and it preceded President Truman's .4 program by seven years.

40:59.641 --> 41:14.837
.4 evolved eventually into USAID, which became a very big promoter of improved technology in third world countries, especially after

41:16.876 --> 41:21.201
in the middle 50s.

41:21.221 --> 41:24.964
But they were not tied together in any way at all.

41:24.984 --> 41:33.153
And then other governments began to, Canadians especially, began to become interested in this.

41:33.173 --> 41:44.745
But there was, I think, one focal point that evolved after the Nobel Prize in 1970 that brought them all together.

41:44.765 --> 41:46.647
I think it's fair to say that

41:47.960 --> 41:54.640
Agriculture is the ugly duckling in most spheres.

41:55.683 --> 41:57.970
It's looked down as a science.

41:58.338 --> 42:05.185
It's second-rate, according to many of the elitists that are part of our university systems.

42:05.385 --> 42:11.552
I'm not talking about in the College of Agriculture, but even there you get the cleavage with the new biotechnology.

42:12.152 --> 42:16.797
They think they're going to solve all of these problems in agriculture's peripheral.

42:16.817 --> 42:19.299
They're damn well mistaken.

42:19.319 --> 42:21.542
They probably don't realize this.

42:21.562 --> 42:25.746
Whatever improvements that they make will have to be

42:25.726 --> 42:32.952
put into a commercial operation by means of the existing programs.

42:33.775 --> 42:36.445
They aren't going to modify

42:36.914 --> 42:44.426
the makeup of a cow and have her perfect from whatever manipulation they make, or any of these other discoveries, which are important.

42:44.446 --> 42:45.908
Don't get me wrong.

42:45.928 --> 42:51.116
But it will have to be incorporated into the total picture.

42:51.216 --> 43:04.356
Now, going back to this ugly duckling image of agriculture, I guess it's because incomes on the land

43:06.091 --> 43:21.595
in the industrial countries compared to and ease of life compared to that in the urban areas which enjoy by and large up until very recently.

43:21.615 --> 43:34.815
Better schools and opportunities in art and crafts and all of the rest of it, better housing for the most part, have contributed to this sort of

43:34.795 --> 43:42.283
looking at agriculture and agricultural science, for that matter, as a kind of second-rate opportunity.

43:42.303 --> 43:43.645
For a bunch of hicks.

43:43.665 --> 43:45.567
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

43:46.928 --> 44:02.305
And I think if one thing that helped refocus thinking about this was the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.

44:02.808 --> 44:08.617
because this was the first time that agricultural scientists had ever gotten a Nobel Prize.

44:08.697 --> 44:08.998
Really?

44:09.138 --> 44:09.919
You were the first one?

44:11.261 --> 44:14.546
I should amplify this in one way.

44:17.291 --> 44:26.605
Lord Boyd Orr, the founding father, the first director general of

44:27.732 --> 44:33.939
FAO, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, won the Nobel Peace Prize.

44:33.959 --> 44:51.240
For his contributions to nutrition during the war, he brought Britain with all its problems on food supplies coming in through the war in a surprisingly good state of nutrition, considering the handicapped.

44:51.600 --> 44:54.043
And he was awarded this.

44:54.648 --> 45:06.985
as well as for his interest in getting FAO, the ideas, focal ideas, and the thing going.

45:07.005 --> 45:22.326
But from the standpoint of a working agricultural scientist, when I received the Peace Prize, and it was a Peace Prize because there's no provisions made for agricultural science,

45:22.542 --> 45:26.148
in the Nobel Foundation.

45:26.168 --> 45:41.614
When I received the Peace Prize, this kind of focused attention because it came on the heels of this tremendous food shortage in South Asia.

45:42.438 --> 45:52.855
which in the middle 60s corresponded to what we've seen the last several years in foods and storage and hunger and misery in the African countries south of the Sahara.

45:53.876 --> 46:01.088
There were many at that time, starting with Bill Paddock, with Paul Ehrlich, with Holden,

46:01.726 --> 46:04.528
who said... Population bomb.

46:04.549 --> 46:05.669
Population bomb.

46:05.890 --> 46:07.711
Forget about them.

46:08.032 --> 46:10.274
They've overshot the population target.

46:11.335 --> 46:12.736
There's nothing can be done.

46:13.356 --> 46:25.287
The world has lost its capacity to produce the food that's needed for this rapidly expanding world population.

46:25.307 --> 46:28.850
You know the songs of gloom and doom.

46:30.191 --> 46:31.092
And it was then...

46:31.696 --> 46:45.597
that in the early 60s, when the program, late 59, when the program of the wheat program was being turned over to the Mexican scientist, Dr. Narraez, and his colleagues when we trained.

46:46.458 --> 46:52.928
And a year later, the whole Mexican program was turned over to the people we trained.

46:54.038 --> 46:56.302
And I think this is in the tape someplace.

46:57.464 --> 47:03.114
I traveled looking at what might be done to increase wheat production from Morocco to India.

47:06.200 --> 47:12.711
And I said we had to start training young people, interdisciplinary.

47:12.731 --> 47:17.700
And I proposed bringing them to Mexico where they could see what it

47:17.680 --> 47:22.026
taken place recently rather than to the U.S.

47:22.046 --> 47:36.246
where this change had been gradual and the agriculture was not very sophisticated and it had been evolving over 100 years of time.
