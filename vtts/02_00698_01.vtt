James R. Bradley, Director of the Texas 
Engineering Extension Service. Today's date is

00:09.440 --> 00:12.244
August 6, 1981. Mr. Bradley, could we begin by your 
telling us something about your early years in

00:12.264 --> 00:17.672
Galveston? Well, I was born in Galveston in 1923 
and was raised about two blocks from the beach and

00:19.014 --> 00:29.650
lived in Galveston until I was approximately 11 or 
12 years old. And when the Depression got my

00:31.745 --> 00:41.818
father's business and he had to go bankrupt, he had 
a small farm up in the country in Galveston County,

00:31.745 --> 00:41.818
in the little town of Altaloma. And we moved up 
there about in 1932. And I spent the rest of my high

00:44.901 --> 00:52.171
school days in the little town of Altaloma. And 
then in 1940, I started . Is that A-L-T-A-L-O-M-A?

00:56.296 --> 00:56.636
Right. A-L-T-A-L-O-M-A. That's in Galveston 
County, too. Okay, elaborate more on how your

00:59.870 --> 01:04.155
family was affected by the Depression, please. 
Well, my father was a concrete contractor, and he

01:05.096 --> 01:13.345
had built all the warehouses on Broadway and 
Galveston, the Kempner warehouses. And when the

01:13.506 --> 01:23.857
Depression hit him in 1929, he continued to stay in 
business until he went through all of his

01:13.506 --> 01:23.857
resources. And when he left in 1932, The only thing 
that he had was a home in this little town with about

01:28.642 --> 01:40.844
15 acres of land, and that was his total financial 
resources. I never felt the Depression myself

01:41.505 --> 01:48.177
because my father always provided for us. And I was 
at such an early age, I didn't, and first

01:53.600 --> 02:17.995
generation, my family's first generation in this 
country, my mother was born in Glasgow, Scotland,

01:53.600 --> 02:17.995
my father was born in Canada, and of course people 
like that don't tell their children problems, and

01:53.600 --> 02:17.995
I didn't even know there was a depression, I didn't 
even know there was a problem until after life,

01:53.600 --> 02:17.995
after later on in life, and so I wasn't really 
affected by it, that I could, I can look back now and

01:53.600 --> 02:17.995
see the hardships that they went through, but I 
didn't see it at the time. How far was it that, was it

02:18.175 --> 02:22.341
when you moved from the big chair? Yeah, we moved 
about, we lived on the west end of Galveston and we

02:23.030 --> 02:29.498
moved up to the Galveston counties about 15, 18 
miles.

02:32.582 --> 02:34.425
Okay, when did you finish high school? I finished 
high school in 1940 and I started A&M in September

02:34.445 --> 02:39.732
1940. Do you remember the famous visit that 
President Roosevelt made to Galveston in 1937? I

02:46.480 --> 02:52.328
remember it very vividly and had the opportunity 
to shake the President's hand when he was going

02:46.480 --> 02:52.328
down Broadway. And his car waved to him. Tell us 
more about that. Well, back those days, we didn't

02:57.314 --> 03:03.262
have a whole lot of entertaining activity. But 
whenever the president or the governor would come

03:03.282 --> 03:09.430
to your town or come close to your town, it was a 
family outing. And probably more so in my family

03:09.450 --> 03:16.960
than most families, because my parents were both 
extremely proud to be American citizens. They had

03:17.761 --> 03:21.606
worked extremely hard, and the United States had 
been extremely good to my daddy. and whenever we

03:22.598 --> 03:51.171
had these kind of occasions my daddy did 
everything in the world he could to get us exposed

03:22.598 --> 03:51.171
to opportunity to see him or shake their hand or if 
they were going to make a speech he made sure we was

03:22.598 --> 03:51.171
there to listen to it and this was not only the 
president this was the governor or this was any

03:22.598 --> 03:51.171
high official the day that the president come to 
galliviston we were down there bright and early my

03:22.598 --> 03:51.171
mother packed a lunch and we sat in a very good 
position was in a very good position when the

03:51.404 --> 04:04.949
president come by and basically because my father 
knew several people and we did have good good seats

03:51.404 --> 04:04.949
and I did actually touch President Roosevelt's 
hand when he come by in the car. Greatest thrill I

04:04.969 --> 04:07.573
guess I ever had in my life except riding with W.O. 
Daniels. At that time, I believe it was the then

04:09.848 --> 04:15.033
Congressman-elect Lyndon Johnson participated 
in that meeting. Did you see him also? Yes, I did.

04:16.935 --> 04:18.836
Was that the first time you had seen him? That was 
the first time I'd ever seen Lyndon Johnson. But

04:20.478 --> 04:21.639
not the last, I presume. No, it was not the last. No, 
I saw him many times. I was with him many times.

04:25.863 --> 04:29.747
Okay, in 1940, you came to A&M in what field? I came 
to A&M in 1940, and I was in what they called

04:30.287 --> 04:38.455
Agriculture Administration, which at that time 
we did not have a business school. And in the

04:39.127 --> 04:46.318
agriculture administration area, I was majoring 
in, you could go either accounting or you could go

04:39.127 --> 04:46.318
marketing and finance. And I selected to go 
marketing and finance rather. And you got a

04:50.385 --> 04:51.286
degree? I got, well, my class, I was in the class of 
44, and they called our class into the service one

04:51.787 --> 04:58.357
semester before we finished. And I went into the 
service in March. March 25, 1943, and we lacked one

05:02.414 --> 05:06.719
semester from graduating. A&M went on a 
year-round basis in 42, so even though we hadn't

05:06.739 --> 05:22.656
been here

05:06.739 --> 05:22.656
but seven semesters, because we got that full 
semester in summertime, they took us out in 43, and

05:06.739 --> 05:22.656
the university let us take examinations and give 
us credit for that semester. I lacked 12 hours from

05:23.437 --> 05:28.682
graduating along with just about everybody in my 
class. There were some 1,100 of us. And they took us

05:30.747 --> 05:39.780
off to Fort Sam Houston, and there we went on to 
Officer's Candidate School. Those that had

05:39.800 --> 05:43.966
contracts went to Officer's Candidate School, 
and I went to Fort Hood. This was the tank

05:44.707 --> 05:45.969
destroyer. We had a former student, a gentleman, 
A.D. Bruce, who was father of the tank destroyers.

05:52.078 --> 05:54.942
It was a new component in the Army. And John Bruce 
come to A&M, and he recruited 35 of us, to attend

06:00.397 --> 06:07.228
Tank Destroyers OCS, and that's where we went 
after we was fully inducted into the Army. And from

06:07.248 --> 06:16.702
the Tank Destroyers School, after graduation, I 
stayed in Tank Destroyers as Officer of Kansas

06:07.248 --> 06:16.702
School, taught for six months, taught .30 caliber 
machine gun. And then I joined the Line Outfit

06:17.804 --> 06:25.476
692nd Tank Destroyer Battalion, and they were in 
the process of getting ready to go overseas. So

06:29.462 --> 06:35.351
shortly after I joined them, 45 days after I joined 
them, we went to Fort Mary, Maryland. And from Fort

06:36.172 --> 06:40.118
Mary, Maryland we went to New York and shipped out 
for Europe. And we got over there in, oh it was about

06:40.138 --> 06:45.485
in October of 1944.

06:48.129 --> 06:52.956
After the D-Day landing, you landed, where did you 
go, France? Yes, we went to France and From France,

06:58.177 --> 07:00.139
we went on into southern Germany. We went into Le 
Havre, and then went on down into southern

07:00.979 --> 07:09.667
Germany, and into Stuttgart, across the 
Siegfried Line. Your group was serving under

07:11.348 --> 07:13.891
General Eisenhower? Well, yes. He was commander 
of all the troops in Europe.

07:20.677 --> 07:27.002
As a tank destroyer battalion, you had one platoon 
of tank destroyers assigned to an infantry

07:20.677 --> 07:27.002
battalion. So my battalion commander was never 
closer than 60 to 100 miles from me. So I was

07:32.639 --> 07:39.268
attached to, every tank destroyer platoon, I was a 
platoon leader, was attached to an infantry

07:32.639 --> 07:39.268
battalion. I was attached to the

07:39.288 --> 07:48.501
103rd Infantry Division, the 9th Battalion of the 
103rd Infantry Division. It was commanded by

07:48.541 --> 07:50.163
General Terry Allen. Never did see the man in my 
life, but I mean, that was our division commander.

07:55.535 --> 08:01.043
And we were assigned to an infantry battalion. And 
I stayed with that infantry battalion right on

08:01.583 --> 08:13.460
through until about,

08:01.583 --> 08:13.460
I guess it was about June of 1945, about a month 
after the war. And then they put us into

08:14.321 --> 08:19.268
occupation.

08:19.288 --> 08:24.175
And in the meantime, my platoon, along with the the 
45th Infantry Division, which was known as the

08:24.762 --> 08:28.127
Rainbow Division. The last combat we saw was in 
Munich. And my last assignment was we were put in to

08:33.234 --> 08:41.707
relieve concentration camp Dachau. And I stayed 
about 36 hours in Munich where concentration camp

08:41.727 --> 08:48.677
Dachau was located. Could you spell that? 
D-A-C-H-U-A. That was the camp where The police

08:54.580 --> 08:58.907
and the people were starved to death, literally 
just starved to death. And there was little big

08:59.629 --> 09:05.999
boxcars of people right outside the 
concentration camp. And as soon as we got that

09:06.620 --> 09:09.906
under control, At that time, I was a company 
commander. My company commander had his arm cut

09:11.914 --> 09:17.019
off, and I'd been a company commander. And then we 
were detailed to go from Concentration Camp

09:17.460 --> 09:24.708
Daukau to Concentration Camp Alok, which was 
about 40 miles away. And that was a typhus fever

09:24.728 --> 09:26.670
camp. Everybody in Concentration Camp Alok, and 
that's A-L-L-A-C-H, had typhus fever, both men

09:26.710 --> 09:34.098
and women. And it was basically just a wired-in 
encampment with little shelter-type cover. I

09:45.645 --> 09:53.694
don't remember the size, but it seemed to me like 
now it was probably 20 or 30 acres for the females

09:45.645 --> 09:53.694
and 20 or 30 acres for the males. They were joining 
each other. They were joining each other and they

09:55.156 --> 10:01.303
just had a little shelter-like type of cover. And 
of course they all had type of fever. They were all

10:03.225 --> 10:06.248
in real bad physical health. And we stayed there 
about We stayed there about five to seven days, and

10:09.083 --> 10:12.368
then we went on. So then our

10:12.468 --> 10:23.244
battalion, our attack destroyer battalion, was 
brought back together for the first time since

10:12.468 --> 10:23.244
we'd been overseas as a battalion. And we got 
together in Rosenheim, Germany. And we stayed in

10:27.731 --> 10:34.180
Rosenheim for about three days, and then each one 
of the companies was assigned a town to go into

10:27.731 --> 10:34.180
occupation. And I was assigned the town of 
Sohuben. That's S-O-L-H-U-E-B-E-N.

10:37.107 --> 10:43.395
Sohuben, Germany. It was a town of about 10,000 to 
12,000 population. And I stayed in occupation

10:46.218 --> 11:01.417
there from about May the 9th to 10th, somewhere 
along in there, to about July to August, to about

10:46.218 --> 11:01.417
July the 1st, somewhere along there. Because on 
the 4th of July, we were moving i remember fourth of

11:03.488 --> 11:29.260
july we was moving from seoul huben down to austria 
it's a little town of coast of austria and it was in

11:03.488 --> 11:29.260
bavaria it was a small town and we stayed there 
about three and a half weeks right near to the end of

11:03.488 --> 11:29.260
august and then we was shipped home we shipped to 
back to camp lucky strike right out of paris and we

11:03.488 --> 11:29.260
was processed to come home and we sailed We were 
three days out at sea when they dropped the first

11:30.117 --> 11:35.384
atomic bomb. When the first atomic bomb was 
dropped in Japan, we stayed on. The ship was

11:41.652 --> 11:43.615
stopped until we got further orders. We stayed, it 
seemed like, for about 36 hours. Then they barred

11:46.518 --> 11:50.604
us to the Boston port. It took us 17 days to get back. 
About two or three days of that we were there.

11:55.936 --> 11:58.063
waiting on instructions on where we should go. 
Were the men surprised when the bomb was dropped?

12:00.511 --> 12:02.578
Definitely. Were they not aware that such a thing 
was even going to happen? Oh, there's always

12:04.866 --> 12:06.070
rumors. During World War II, every day, you know, 
we heard there was a

12:12.322 --> 12:37.367
equipment coming out or they had new some type of 
chemical that was going to wipe out all the enemy

12:12.322 --> 12:37.367
but leave us all healthy you know it was constant 
this was constant but but yes we was shocked

12:12.322 --> 12:37.367
because that's what we had been hearing about 
really that's what all the rumors were about but we

12:12.322 --> 12:37.367
back then as far as I was concerned I was very young 
and didn't have a whole lot of imagination and I

12:37.887 --> 12:40.450
couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as an atomic 
bomb. I mean, it wasn't even my wildest

12:40.650 --> 12:53.446
imagination that there would be such a weapon that 
could destroy the human race, the human body, and

12:40.650 --> 12:53.446
the physical plants as an atomic bomb. I mean, I 
couldn't even have dreamed of something in my

12:53.506 --> 12:56.790
wildest imagination. So certainly we were 
extremely shocked. Do you think that the dropping

12:58.613 --> 13:02.177
of the bomb shortened the war in the Pacific? 
Pardon? Do you think the dropping of the bomb

13:02.437 --> 13:05.722
shortened the war in the Pacific? It stopped the 
war. It stopped the war. Do you think that the war

13:08.932 --> 13:11.415
would have continued indefinitely without the 
bombs? Well, I'm not going to say indefinitely,

13:11.435 --> 13:14.840
but it would have continued much longer than it 
did. The Japanese weren't whipped until we

13:16.422 --> 13:18.744
dropped that bomb. They were slightly bruised, 
but they weren't whipped. Well, most of the men

13:22.449 --> 13:28.296
that you served with, did they approve of seeing 
this bomb used? I wouldn't know. I wouldn't have

13:29.157 --> 13:30.139
the slightest idea. I was damn well pleased with 
it, I'll tell you for sure. And I would say that most

13:33.863 --> 13:36.987
of us was, because back those days, In my company, I 
didn't have anybody over probably 24 or 5 years of

13:37.743 --> 13:42.470
age. Most of my people in my company were from 18 to 
21 or 2 years of age. There was no young person who

13:48.238 --> 13:54.707
wanted to get killed by somebody they'd never seen 
or heard of, so we were damn glad for the water to

13:48.238 --> 13:54.707
stop. They were our enemy. Okay, you came back in 
1945 to the Port of Boston. Then you came back to

14:03.639 --> 14:04.881
Galveston. No, uh, well, I didn't get discharged. 
I got, they give us 45 days leave. Uh, they called it

14:11.336 --> 14:29.164
R&R, rest and recreation, and I did come home to the 
little town of Alcalon today with my folks and

14:11.336 --> 14:29.164
that, and then I didn't get discharged until, uh, I 
got discharged on January 13, 1946, and I was on

14:11.336 --> 14:29.164
annual leave until April 2nd, and, uh, April the 
7th, because I got married April the 2nd, but I was

14:30.325 --> 14:35.704
on annual leave until April the 7th. And then I 
started school, come back and got my 12 hours off

14:35.724 --> 14:39.557
starting in June. Where is your wife from? She's 
from Fort Worth. Okay, you came back to A&M in 46 and

14:42.813 --> 14:48.562
finished up the same year. Yes, I finished up in the 
summer. I got my 12 hours off and then I stayed on for

14:51.627 --> 14:57.958
one semester of graduate work and left in January 
of 47. What did you do your graduate work in? Same

15:00.281 --> 15:02.205
area, agriculture economics. I just went on to 
agriculture economics. Okay, then what about

15:04.709 --> 15:05.850
1947? What did you do? At that time, Mobile Oil 
Company was, the reason I left, Mobile Oil Company

15:07.973 --> 15:17.163
was starting an executive development training 
program, and they recruited three. They

15:17.183 --> 15:19.386
recruited a graduate from RISE. I was recruited 
from A&M, and I was recruited from the University

15:20.827 --> 15:25.793
of Oklahoma. And so they put us on a three-year 
training program, and it was the first time that

15:25.913 --> 15:31.139
they'd ever had one. It was Magnolia Petroleum 
Company at that time. It was the first program I

15:32.860 --> 15:36.124
had, the first executive training program I had. 
And during that three years, I was exposed to

15:36.728 --> 15:41.256
everything Magnolia Petroleum Company. That was 
their refineries, their gas, their headquarters

15:41.276 --> 15:46.665
office, the whole thing. And then after three 
years of that, I was made head of their liquefied

15:46.685 --> 15:51.072
petroleum gas department. What was his name? 
Dallas. Dallas. And I stayed there for about two

15:54.418 --> 15:56.982
years. a little less than two years as head of the 
department, and then they created this

15:57.468 --> 16:03.557
industrial economics research at Texas A&M 
University. And I was contacted with, I'd been

16:04.558 --> 16:09.605
interested in coming to work in this new area at 
that time. It was under the Engineering and

16:09.645 --> 16:12.529
Criminal Station. And I come down and interviewed 
Dr. Miller, who was the director of the

16:12.549 --> 16:18.237
Engineering and Criminal Station at that time. 
What was his first name? Arthur W. Miller. That's

16:20.941 --> 16:24.606
M-E-L-L-O-H. And, uh, interviewed him and it 
sounded interesting and I wanted to finish my

16:25.058 --> 16:28.723
graduate work. I just lacked, as well as I 
remember, about 14 or 15 hours to get my master's

16:28.763 --> 16:38.037
degree and they gave me an opportunity to work full 
time and take a course while I was going to school.

16:38.077 --> 16:45.208
I'd always wanted to finish my degree so I come back 
with an understanding that I'd stay until I got my

16:38.077 --> 16:45.208
master's degree and then I'd leave. That was in 
1951 and I never left. I went on and got my master's

16:48.973 --> 16:53.580
degree in 1954.

16:53.881 --> 17:03.757
This

16:53.881 --> 17:03.757
engineering extension service was established 
in 1948. What was the purpose of the organization

17:05.199 --> 17:07.703
when it was established? Well, the whole system 
was established in 1948. The activities, a lot of

17:11.489 --> 17:19.382
the activities in the engineering extension 
service had been going on since 1919. Vocational

17:19.514 --> 17:22.437
touch industrial teachers started in 1919. Our 
fire school started in 1931. Our supervisor

17:24.800 --> 17:28.484
training division started in 1940. And during the 
war years, a lot of the programs, a lot of the

17:29.084 --> 17:39.556
training that was done in your war class was done by 
that, at that time, by an organization known as the

17:29.084 --> 17:39.556
Industrial Extension Service. That was the 
forerunner of the Engineering Extension

17:40.437 --> 17:44.781
Service. And after the war, the Board of Regents, 
at that time it was the Board of Directors, created

17:46.953 --> 17:53.460
the Texas A&M College system. At that time they 
turned the Industrial Extension Service into the

17:53.580 --> 18:01.368
Texas Engineering Extension Service along with 
the other parts of the system at that time. Now the

18:01.388 --> 18:12.659
purpose of the mandate that we have from the 
legislature is to provide vocational technical

18:01.388 --> 18:12.659
training programs on an extension basis to the 
citizens of Texas. Now what they mean by that is

18:12.679 --> 18:15.222
this is training basically for the employed 
worker. A high percentage, upwards of 85% of all of

18:18.011 --> 18:23.957
our training programs are for the employed 
worker. That's to upgrade them so they'll be more

18:23.977 --> 18:31.344
productive and more qualified for promotion. Now 
since 1948, there's been quite a change in the

18:31.364 --> 18:40.553
Engineering Extension Service, and it'll be 
quite a change in the Engineering Extension

18:31.364 --> 18:40.553
Service the next 20 or 30 years, too. You've got to 
change. We stayed a very small organization up

18:43.822 --> 18:49.408
until about 1975. And I didn't join the 
Engineering Extension Service until 1973. I

18:54.254 --> 18:58.759
stayed as head of the Industrial Economics 
Research Division shortly after I joined the

18:54.254 --> 18:58.759
division. I joined in 51 and in 58 I made head of the 
Industrial Economics Research Division. And I

19:02.984 --> 19:08.971
stayed head of that until I become Director of 
Continuing Education and Director of

19:02.984 --> 19:08.971
Engineering Extension Service. It was a joint 
appointment in 1973. Up until that time, the

19:13.083 --> 19:16.929
university had never had a director of continuing 
education. But when we come in with our rudder tire

19:16.989 --> 19:27.003
and all of our continuing education facilities, 
Dr. Williams created the position of director of

19:16.989 --> 19:27.003
continuing education. And at the time, the 
director of the engineering extension service

19:27.724 --> 19:36.998
was retiring, Mr. Bearden, so he put me as director 
of both the office of continuing education and

19:27.724 --> 19:36.998
director of engineering extension service. And I 
stayed in that capacity until about 1978, and then

19:37.163 --> 19:46.332
I come full time with the Engineering Extension 
Service. But the period from 70, in 1973 we had,

19:46.352 --> 19:58.405
when I came into the organization, we had 72 
employees, and we had a $1,700,000 budget. And we

19:58.425 --> 20:01.568
had approximately seven or eight training 
divisions. The organization started to grow, and

20:02.088 --> 20:10.857
now we have in excess of 340 employees, and we're 
operating at about an $18 million budget. And when

20:10.877 --> 20:17.203
it got to this point, when it got to be about $12 
million, $13 million, I come in now. I think it's

20:17.564 --> 20:28.635
important that everyone that ever hears about the 
Engineering Extension Service realize that we

20:17.564 --> 20:28.635
only get 8% or 9% of our money from appropriated 
services. More than 90% of our operating budget

20:29.392 --> 20:33.138
comes from fees and contracts. So this is a 
self-support organization. People that use our

20:36.283 --> 20:38.206
services pay for it. So this is quite different 
than when you're on an appropriated, hard-money

20:40.930 --> 20:47.681
type organization. Also, all of our programs are 
oriented to the adult citizen. Our average age of

20:52.728 --> 20:55.553
our student would be in excess of 30 years of age. 
They're adult students. They come from every type

20:57.758 --> 21:04.045
of background, every type of educational 
background, every type of work background that

20:57.758 --> 21:04.045
you could possibly think of. They're sponsored by 
their companies in most cases. 95% of our

21:07.388 --> 21:11.032
students, their fees are paid for by the company 
they work for. And this type of adult student, if

21:12.133 --> 21:21.022
they don't get the type of training that they think 
is going to be helpful to them, they just get up and

21:12.133 --> 21:21.022
walk out. So the type of instructor that we have in 
the engineering detention service is a unique

21:27.121 --> 21:29.043
type of individual. First, they have to be highly 
qualified. And they're highly qualified because

21:32.586 --> 21:38.391
they're talking to people that's working with 
them every day of the week. They've got to be able to

21:38.431 --> 21:39.772
teach. They've got to be a good teacher. They've 
got to be able to communicate with this adult

21:41.754 --> 21:45.598
student, which is very difficult to do. And then 
the third thing is they've

21:46.739 --> 21:53.645
got to always be well prepared. They've got to have 
the latest training aids. They have

21:56.500 --> 21:58.243
well-prepared lesson plans. There's no such 
thing in our type of educational program as you

21:58.644 --> 22:04.133
have to take this. We don't have a kind of program 
like you have to take, like you have to take English

22:04.293 --> 22:09.663
103 to get a degree. None of our programs they have 
to take to get anything. They ain't taking them, so

22:11.766 --> 22:15.853
they'll upgrade themselves. And they're 
expensive. So it's just a real... real challenge

22:22.218 --> 22:24.762
to work with this type of student. How expensive is 
it to take these courses? We vary. We have all

22:27.185 --> 22:30.370
variations of expenses. We'll go from probably a 
high of $575 for a 36-hour course. It all has its

22:37.220 --> 22:45.913
materials to maybe

22:37.220 --> 22:45.913
probably we'll charge as low as $40 for a 20-hour 
course in water and wastewater. So it'll go

22:48.876 --> 22:53.844
anywhere from $40 to $575 for anywhere from a 20- to 
a 36-hour course. Most of these expenses are paid

22:54.084 --> 22:56.187
by the employer? Yes. The major portion, we have 
individuals take them that's not employed, but by

22:58.290 --> 23:13.913
far the largest, well, way up in the 90% would come 
from their employer.

23:13.933 --> 23:15.816
About how many instructors do we have? We have 
approximately 260, 270 instructors and we have

23:16.589 --> 23:24.344
about 70 or 80 support personnel. Are most of these 
instructors employed by trade schools

23:24.465 --> 23:27.691
throughout the state? No, they're all employed by 
the Engineering Intentional Service. We have a

23:30.316 --> 23:32.982
full-time staff. That's full-time staff. Where 
are these courses taught? All over the state of

23:35.707 --> 23:37.190
Texas. We teach in all 253 of the 254 counties. In 
other words, these people are full-time

23:40.281 --> 23:43.205
employees of the Extension Service? That is 
correct. Full-time staff. I see. Where are some of

23:46.070 --> 23:47.232
the... I know you have a branch in San Antonio. 
Where else do you have branches? We have four

23:49.575 --> 23:50.577
centers. We have four regional centers. We 
started in 76 creating centers. We have one center

23:54.763 --> 23:56.225
in San Antonio. We have about eight staff members 
assigned down there. We have a center in

23:59.190 --> 24:00.632
Arlington. We have about 20 staff members 
assigned in Arlington. We have about... We have

24:06.269 --> 24:13.496
eight or ten staff members out from West Texas and 
Florida in our regional center, what we call our

24:06.269 --> 24:13.496
West Texas Regional Strengthening Center. And 
we're right now just getting the fourth regional

24:13.516 --> 24:18.702
center off the ground, which we'll be in the 
process of fixing. We have two people. In addition

24:20.664 --> 24:23.046
to our centers, we have offices. We have an office 
in Houston with about 18 staff members. We have an

24:26.930 --> 24:30.454
office in Huntsville with about eight staff 
members.

24:36.037 --> 24:41.083
We have an office in Houston with about 18, 
Huntsville with about 8, 8 of 10. We have an office

24:42.785 --> 24:46.390
in Wesley Cole that's got two staff members. We've 
got an office in Lubbock with two staff members.

24:50.415 --> 24:54.781
And then in Abilene, we've got about five staff 
members in Abilene. Now, the difference between a

24:54.801 --> 25:00.728
center and an office is an office has not been 
approved by, it hadn't been presented to the

25:02.547 --> 25:05.510
legislature for approval. The center has 
legislative approval. Offices, you don't have to

25:07.992 --> 25:09.974
have legislative approval. However, when an 
office becomes big enough, they will go in for a

25:09.994 --> 25:13.858
center. Okay, how many instructing personnel do 
you have here on campus? Well, we've got about, the

25:19.943 --> 25:24.007
instructional personnel, probably 120. These 
are full-time? All full-time. Everybody in the

25:28.652 --> 25:30.614
engineering service is full-time. We do not use 
part-time. Could you give us some examples of some

25:32.399 --> 25:37.504
of the types of courses that are offered? We offer 
575 different courses. Just say give me half a

25:40.287 --> 25:42.669
dozen or so. Well, all types of supervisor 
training. We do all levels of supervisor training

25:45.252 --> 25:51.018
from the foreman right on up to top management. We 
do all types of telephone training from the

25:51.038 --> 26:00.567
installation, teaching installation of the 
telephone to the management of a complete

25:51.038 --> 26:00.567
telephone company. operation management. We do 
the same thing for our power companies and our

26:02.330 --> 26:05.314
electric power companies. We do everything from

26:05.354 --> 26:12.302
installation right on up to the generating plant. 
We go all through the electric power utilities. We

26:15.747 --> 26:22.775
do all types of electronic training, many 
computers, all types of electronic training

26:15.747 --> 26:22.775
programs. Marine electronics is a very popular 
field for us. Of course, everybody knows about our

26:26.300 --> 26:28.402
fire program. National and international are 
known for our fire program. We have probably the

26:31.529 --> 26:44.172
only hands-on training, all has its material 
training program in the world, and we go all over

26:31.529 --> 26:44.172
the world to put on our courses, by the way. We go all 
over Europe, Spain, and several other places to

26:44.192 --> 26:50.643
put on our oil spill school. We're very heavily 
involved in our vocational and industrial

26:51.144 --> 26:55.512
teachers. We train about 80% of all the vocational 
and industrial teachers in the state of Texas

26:55.998 --> 27:01.744
teaching the teacher how to teach. It's a six 
hours, three hour course. They get academic

27:05.007 --> 27:06.288
credit for it. It's a total of 18 hours. And this is 
just teaching the teacher how to teach. Lesson

27:10.372 --> 27:16.338
plans, use of visual aids,

27:10.372 --> 27:16.338
all types of construction equipment. We have just 
about every type of piece of equipment that you can

27:16.358 --> 27:23.305
get, heavy equipment.

27:23.993 --> 27:25.635
some 560 more. I can give you a catalog if you'd 
like. Yeah, I saw a catalog out in the lobby. Tell us

27:31.181 --> 27:34.004
a little more about the fire school. Well, fire 
school is one of the oldest programs we got. It was

27:36.326 --> 27:46.137
legislated, it become under the Texas A&M 
University in 1931 by the act of the legislature

27:36.326 --> 27:46.137
and we got our first appropriation in 1931. The 
fire school is

27:53.525 --> 27:55.549
started out by just training municipal firemen. 
And this was the only fire field that they could get

27:56.450 --> 28:00.017
in live training. And we believe in teaching 
people fire training about burning fire. You

28:04.605 --> 28:07.110
don't believe by showing them movies. We believe 
they've got to get out there and feel the heat of the

28:07.130 --> 28:16.006
fire, and get the smoke in their eyes, and at least 
realize what the danger of it is. We're for fire

28:16.687 --> 28:17.929
prevention. The fire program stayed reasonably 
small up until about 1973 and 71, 72, 73

28:19.462 --> 28:29.294
we started industrial fire school, started 
industrial training. Right now about probably

28:29.314 --> 28:35.301
80% of our training in the fire program is for the 
industrial sector. This is for your refinery,

28:35.321 --> 28:43.892
chemical companies, all your ship companies. We 
do an awful lot of training for the marine shipping

28:43.912 --> 28:46.735
industry. We do a lot of training for ports and 
things of this nature, offshore drilling and

28:47.525 --> 28:53.174
these kind of things. That program right now is 
about at a $4 million level. Their budget this year

28:58.323 --> 29:00.466
will be about $4 million. And about $3,700,000 of 
that comes from fees and contracts and basically

29:01.308 --> 29:06.937
from the industrial sector. The only programs 
that we do for municipalities is basically for the

29:08.640 --> 29:12.486
volunteer firemen. And we don't charge anything 
for that. We've got 12 extension instructors that

29:14.721 --> 29:20.431
don't do anything but go from one volunteer fire 
department to another throughout the state of

29:14.721 --> 29:20.431
Texas. Because these are the people, these people 
don't get anything for that service. That public

29:24.077 --> 29:27.984
service they provide to citizens of their city, 
they get nothing for it. So we don't charge them

29:28.625 --> 29:30.328
anything for their training. However, if they 
didn't have volunteer fire departments, the

29:31.029 --> 29:38.562
insurance key rate would go completely out of 
existence. Unbelievable. Since they provide

29:39.854 --> 29:48.542
their time free, the legislature gives me an 
appropriation, and we provide the training to the

29:39.854 --> 29:48.542
volunteer fire department. So you have them come 
here and then you also go to them. Right, we do it

29:51.164 --> 29:52.485
both ways. We have them come here once a year, 
basically. Now the local volunteer fire

29:55.728 --> 30:01.393
department sometimes come out here on the weekend 
and use our field, but basically we go to their

29:55.728 --> 30:01.393
department. And one week a year we have an annual 
municipal fire school here, and we have somewhere

30:01.514 --> 30:08.680
from 2,500 to 3,000 students participating. When 
is that held each year? It's held the second week in

30:10.925 --> 30:15.011
July. What about a little more on vocational 
agricultural training? We do no vocational

30:18.876 --> 30:22.962
agricultural training. That's done by the 
Agriculture Education Department. We don't get

30:25.586 --> 30:31.594
into agriculture

30:25.586 --> 30:31.594
at all. What about welding? We don't get into 
welding. The only thing that we do, that's Dunbag

30:36.858 --> 30:47.614
education, the only welding we do in San Antonio, 
in our San Antonio training division, we have one

30:36.858 --> 30:47.614
course in welding over there. That's our skill 
center, and that's a separate part of the

30:47.694 --> 30:51.440
engineering attention service. It's the only 
part that we have. We don't do it anyplace else. We

30:56.567 --> 30:59.011
have what we call the San Antonio training 
division. It has some six or seven skills. This is

31:00.954 --> 31:03.558
skill training rather than vocational technical 
training. This is skill training. Welding is

31:05.309 --> 31:11.535
taught over there on a very limited basis, and it's 
a nine-month program. And the student has to be a

31:11.555 --> 31:16.780
CEDA student, that's a Comprehensive Employment 
Training Act student. The government funds the

31:16.800 --> 31:23.067
program totally, pays the student $3, whatever 
the minimum wage is, while they're attending

31:16.800 --> 31:23.067
class. And they normally go for about nine months. 
Now, we teach them everything. There's more to

31:27.431 --> 31:30.294
teaching welding than just welding. Some of these 
people that we have, and lots of them, first you've

31:30.314 --> 31:34.438
got to teach them how to read instructions. 
They'll spend a lot of time in what we call

31:36.771 --> 31:45.043
job-related courses, which is how to read 
instructions, how to use certain tools, so forth

31:36.771 --> 31:45.043
and so on. But the program over there is a 
nine-month program, and welding is one of the

31:45.984 --> 31:52.834
programs, and we have others in business 
technology. We've got one in auto electronics.

31:57.421 --> 31:58.843
We've got one in sheet metal. We've got one in radio 
and television repair. But we've got some seven

32:05.418 --> 32:08.483
skill type. And they're all long-term paid. And 
that's paid for fully by the federal government.

32:12.529 --> 32:19.339
Do you have any figures on how many people in a given 
year take courses under the Extension Service

32:12.529 --> 32:19.339
auspices? Oh, yeah. We can tell you specifically. 
Last year, and it's important you have a copy of it,

32:22.044 --> 32:27.732
last year we had a little over 50,000 students. 
And... This gives you the number of student hours.

32:32.364 --> 32:34.867
We had 1,747,000 student hours. We had 2,094 
different classes. This gives you the programs,

32:38.651 --> 32:42.995
classes conducted, hours in session students 
enrolled. We can tell you every year, this year,

32:43.936 --> 32:48.822
we're going to be at about 55,000 students. We'll 
know around September. Do you have some people who

32:49.883 --> 32:53.867
take more than one course, or most of them just take 
one course? Most of them take one course.

32:55.469 --> 32:56.670
Occasionally, you'll find one that'll take more 
than one. You'll find some that maybe will take a

32:58.088 --> 33:05.738
telephone course and then two or three years later 
if it gets promoted to a supervisor, they'll come

32:58.088 --> 33:05.738
into our supervisor training program. 
Basically, they're within one or two areas. Could

33:10.504 --> 33:12.927
you elaborate a little more on the supervisor 
training program? Well, the supervisor training

33:13.809 --> 33:18.174
program is just a very, what we call a short course 
program. They'll range from 12 hours to 40 hours.

33:24.207 --> 33:27.873
The longest course we have in supervisor training 
is 40 hours. Most of them run in the 12 to 18 hour

33:28.954 --> 33:33.902
sections. We have about 10 or 12 different 
supervisor courses we start. We can start the man

33:39.430 --> 33:43.236
just before he becomes a foreman. Normally, the 
people we work with are the companies that have

33:43.256 --> 33:50.367
identified these people that they will be foremen 
or they will be a supervisor. And before they get in

33:50.431 --> 33:57.421
this position, they'll normally enroll them in 
our courses to get a little background on what

33:50.431 --> 33:57.421
supervisor training is. And we'll take them. 
We've taken the same person from the time he took

33:59.705 --> 34:09.940
the very basic supervisor training, the basic 
foreman training course right on through to the

33:59.705 --> 34:09.940
case of Alamo Steel. I think he's vice president of 
the company right now, and he's been to every one of

34:10.000 --> 34:15.508
them. But we take them on up. Most cases don't get 
that far. Most times they take one or two, and that

34:18.321 --> 34:23.987
ends it. What are some of the companies that hire 
the Extension Service to conduct courses for

34:24.007 --> 34:28.431
their employees?

34:31.974 --> 34:42.884
Some of them, Dow Chemical Company, Temple 
Industries, Lone Star Gas, Southwestern Bell

34:31.974 --> 34:42.884
Telephone, there's 10,000. I could go on and on and 
on. Does other states have an engineering

34:44.684 --> 34:48.568
extension service like Texas has? No, there's not 
another engineering extension service in the

34:48.588 --> 34:52.631
United States like the engineering extension 
service. There's several engineering extension

34:52.651 --> 35:03.261
services over the state of Texas, but they're 
basically related to just, they're very small,

34:52.651 --> 35:03.261
and basically they're related to just a 
professional engineer. Well, then Texas is a

35:04.322 --> 35:07.445
pioneer in this concept of an extension service. 
It sure is. It sure is. Why do you suppose that this

35:09.847 --> 35:12.970
developed in Texas and not other states? Oh, 
basically Texas, I would think, I can't answer

35:14.300 --> 35:22.072
your question specifically, but my opinion is 
that Texas was a rural state. Texas didn't have a

35:22.172 --> 35:25.617
great deal of industry in it until the last 10 or 15 
years. We have 67 rural electric co-ops. We have 82

35:30.104 --> 35:34.691
little family-owned rural telephone companies. 
We have thousands of little communities. And

35:39.798 --> 35:42.923
there was no way that these people could get any 
training. The cost would be prohibitive for them

35:44.337 --> 35:48.743
to go send their employees off to training. So I 
think the legislature, well I think the Board of

35:48.763 --> 35:58.077
Regents of the Texas Indian University System, 
you know, probably had numerous requests for

35:48.763 --> 35:58.077
these types of training programs. We are the land 
grant university in the state of Texas and this is a

35:58.097 --> 36:03.404
function of a land grant university. And to these 
requests and then one program got started and then

36:07.405 --> 36:09.728
A need would rise out here, and they'd contact us. 
And just like we're doing right now, the reason

36:09.788 --> 36:15.955
that we are in many things as we are now is because 
the people asked us to do it. They asked us to do it,

36:15.975 --> 36:18.979
and they paid for it. We're in, you know, every day 
we're practically opening up a new program area

36:19.459 --> 36:24.125
because there's a need. And people contact us 
because they know we have the capability of doing

36:24.325 --> 36:27.068
it. And one thing just leads to another. Now the 
state's becoming highly reasonably good

36:28.911 --> 36:32.715
industrialized. There's going to be more and more 
of it as the people come into the South. The more

36:36.717 --> 36:40.942
people that come here, the more companies come 
here, the more training we're going to have to do.

36:42.063 --> 36:53.215
And we're projecting that the next 10 or 15 years in 
our engineering attention service are going to be

36:42.063 --> 36:53.215
high growth years. And it might even extend much 
farther than that, but we can foresee that far out.

36:58.041 --> 36:59.983
And one thing led to another. It was a need after the 
rural electric co-op's music training, how to

37:01.064 --> 37:05.509
teach a man to climb a pole. And then when we started 
doing that, the Texas Department of Corrections

37:06.333 --> 37:10.679
said, well, you know, we've got inmates in here. 
We've got a lot of poles in our prison system, so why

37:10.719 --> 37:16.127
don't we send our inmates over there? Well, we do 
about a million and a half dollars' worth of

37:16.147 --> 37:20.913
training for the inmates over at the Texas 
Department of Corrections. They bring them over

37:21.975 --> 37:23.637
here, and we go over there. If it's a 
high-capitalized training program, they'll

37:24.579 --> 37:28.444
bring their people here. If we can do it with a 
little bit of capital goods, then we take the

37:28.504 --> 37:31.969
program there. Then you expect this program to 
continue to expand through the 80s. What are some

37:37.910 --> 37:39.932
of the ways that you think it will? Well, it's going 
to expand the electronic part of our program, the

37:40.373 --> 37:44.178
electronic training division. It's going to have 
rapid expansion. The public works training

37:46.480 --> 37:52.368
division, and this is training programs that we 
put on for all employees of municipalities and

37:46.480 --> 37:52.368
counties. It's going to expand rapidly. I'm 
saying that because people are going to have to

37:54.671 --> 38:01.399
produce more, and the only way they can produce 
more is to be better trained. That's the only way

38:02.206 --> 38:07.893
you can increase productivity is get better 
trained people, better equipment, better

38:02.206 --> 38:07.893
people. Public works is going to expand rapidly. 
The industrial fire school is going to expand

38:09.715 --> 38:12.278
rapidly. We know the oil and hazardous materials 
are growing at a very rapid rate, faster than we can

38:13.399 --> 38:19.106
get good people. We're just now getting inland. 
All of our training has been for our

38:21.188 --> 38:27.916
water-oriented oil and hazardous material 
training. We're now getting inland, and with all

38:28.176 --> 38:31.200
your railroads, Tank trucks, tank cars going 
through all these major cities, and the railroad

38:32.142 --> 38:38.709
runs right through the center of every city. 
That's going to take a tremendous amount of

38:38.729 --> 38:43.995
training to keep these people trained, because 
there are going to be accidents. And right now,

38:44.015 --> 38:47.158
it's void as far as training is concerned. And 
we've been in this for about a year, and we can't

38:47.179 --> 38:53.045
even come close to filling the request for our 
training programs. That's just for inland.

38:54.326 --> 38:56.749
That's for towns like Every town's got a railroad 
going through it. Every town's got a highway going

38:59.358 --> 39:00.660
through it. And every town's got one or the other 
and sometimes both. How do you keep your courses

39:05.187 --> 39:08.191
upgraded to meet the changing needs? Well, we try 
to keep our instructors on their feet, what I call

39:08.211 --> 39:12.779
on their feet, 40 weeks a year. And that gives them 
12 weeks a year for what we call professional

39:13.880 --> 39:22.073
development, course development, annual leave, 
sick leave, and so forth. So we try to keep our

39:22.093 --> 39:24.998
instructors out of the classroom at least 12 weeks 
a year to let them do this. What about the role of

39:32.508 --> 39:36.773
research in the Extension Service? We do no 
research at all. We do program development. I

39:40.719 --> 39:41.860
don't consider that research. We do program 
development. We use research organizations. We

39:47.127 --> 39:48.569
use our engineering experiments. They developed 
our all-school school. Our all-school school.

39:53.564 --> 39:59.211
The Engineering Experiment Station developed 
that whole program for us, and then when they got it

39:53.564 --> 39:59.211
developed, we took it over and implemented it. We 
use other organizations that have developed

39:59.231 --> 40:06.341
programs, and we develop our own. We use advisory 
committees an awful lot in this organization. In

40:09.385 --> 40:18.336
other words, if a company comes to us and says they 
want a program developed in marine electronics,

40:09.385 --> 40:18.336
we'll use that as an example. But we'll go to the 
marine industry, and we will get five or six people

40:18.356 --> 40:22.862
together and In this case, Dr. Fife worked with 
that committee anywhere from a week to six months

40:23.500 --> 40:32.549
in developing it correctly to make sure it gives 
them what they want and what they need. And once

40:33.651 --> 40:38.656
this is developed, then we start conducting it. 
There's numerous ways you do program

40:38.676 --> 40:42.099
development.

40:44.041 --> 40:53.271
And as I said, all of our people are, they have to be 
outstanding people in their areas of interest,

40:44.041 --> 40:53.271
and they have to keep current. So in doing this, we 
do a lot of in-house program development. We don't

40:57.936 --> 40:58.997
call it research. Do most of your teaching 
personnel hold master's degrees? No. I would say

41:03.864 --> 41:05.766
it depends on the area of interest. In my... All of 
them have this material. Yes, everybody in there

41:08.931 --> 41:11.214
has to have a master's degree or above. In my 
telephone program, we don't have any, I don't

41:12.015 --> 41:17.422
think, with a master's degree. Most of them are 
just good craftsmen. In our... In our teacher

41:22.225 --> 41:25.650
training program, they're all master's degree 
people or above. In our electronic program,

41:26.571 --> 41:29.375
they're all BS degree people or above. In our 
public works program, they're all practically

41:29.875 --> 41:34.221
master's degree. We have one or two bachelor's 
degrees. You go to our electric landing program,

41:36.384 --> 41:42.552
we've got one person in that division with a 
degree, and that's the division head. Maybe two.

41:42.953 --> 41:44.595
We've got two in that division with degrees. The 
rest of them are just good craftsmen. And it'll

41:47.605 --> 41:48.707
vary between programs. In our construction 
equipment, we have two people with master's

41:48.727 --> 41:51.571
degrees. The rest of them have no degrees. What 
about the teacher training section? Could you

41:54.916 --> 41:56.278
elaborate on that? Well, every one of those has to 
have a master's degree or above. I mean, as far as

41:59.383 --> 42:01.566
what this section does. Well, that section trains 
all the vocational technical teachers in high

42:01.586 --> 42:10.660
schools and community colleges and in companies 
as far as anybody that's going to teach. that's

42:11.095 --> 42:17.281
never had a teaching certificate, haven't gone 
through the basic courses of teaching in college.

42:17.661 --> 42:18.362
They're good craftsmen. Most cases, they're not 
even college graduates. Your vocational

42:20.984 --> 42:28.331
technical teachers in high schools are good 
craftsmen, like your carpenter, welder, and all

42:20.984 --> 42:28.331
that. So what we do is try to take the ability that 
they have and then teach them how to teach so they

42:28.351 --> 42:36.318
can convey it to the students. We do, I don't know 
what percent, it's a high percentage, probably

42:36.538 --> 42:41.102
75% to 90%. Of all the teacher training for high 
school teachers in the vocational and industrial

42:41.723 --> 42:57.082
teachers area, and the same thing we did for 
Southwestern Bell, any company that's got

42:41.723 --> 42:57.082
training programs, we normally take the people 
that's going to do the teaching and give them these

42:41.723 --> 42:57.082
teacher training courses.

43:00.206 --> 43:04.592
That goes for fire departments, police 
departments, anybody that's got a training

43:00.206 --> 43:04.592
program.

43:07.981 --> 43:10.263
Is there anything else we need to say before we 
conclude? Well, I don't know what you've come to

43:10.544 --> 43:14.748
get, but if I've given you what you want, then I 
conclude. If there's anything else you want, let

43:15.088 --> 43:17.351
me know. Well, I don't believe right off hand. I 
appreciate you taking the time to talk with me.

43:22.195 --> 43:24.818
Well, I'll be glad to give you any information you 
want. And if you want to take the annual report, if

43:25.058 --> 43:32.846
you want to take a course catalog, I think this 
makes you perfectly welcome to it. Thank you, Dan.

43:33.607 --> 43:34.528
Thank you very kindly.
