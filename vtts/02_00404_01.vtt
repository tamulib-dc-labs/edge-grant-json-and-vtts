WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:01.973
You all ready? Yes. And start, if you'll start with 
your name and the date you were born and where you

00:03.895 --> 00:08.521
were born. I am Florencio Gutierrez. I was born in 
Guerrero, Tamaulipas, Mexico in February 4th,

00:11.605 --> 00:18.615
1899. Guerrero

00:18.815 --> 00:28.047
lies two miles south of the old Zapata City, 60 
miles south of Laredo. The history begins in 1910

00:36.261 --> 00:42.728
when General Porfirio Diaz was president of 
Mexico. The history of the revolution begins

00:43.990 --> 00:46.293
then. At which time he had completed about 30 years 
of government. In 1910, Mexico celebrated the

00:56.326 --> 01:01.632
centenary. And soon afterward, a man named 
Francisco Madero from

01:03.013 --> 01:20.471
Parra, Coahuila, started a movement to change the 
government in Mexico.

01:23.174 --> 01:25.877
After a

01:34.953 --> 01:41.640
Well, there was a period of time when Díaz was 
fighting back, wasn't there?

01:44.203 --> 02:01.281
Francisco

01:44.203 --> 02:01.281
Madero started the political movement, and he was 
arrested by the Porfirio Diaz government was

02:01.632 --> 02:11.886
released, and then he started the actual 
revolution in the state of Chihuahua. After some

02:13.288 --> 02:23.403
time, his forces took over the city of Ciudad 
Juarez across from El Paso, Texas. After

02:24.464 --> 02:30.913
that event, General Porfirio Diaz resigned from 
his presidency and moved to Paris, France. After

02:39.685 --> 02:49.299
the elections were held, Francisco Madero was 
elected president and took office about 1912.

02:52.364 --> 02:58.032
In

02:52.364 --> 02:58.032
February 1913,

03:00.172 --> 03:01.634
He was assassinated. He and the Vice President.

03:11.087 --> 03:11.668
Pino Suarez. The Vice President Pino Suarez. And 
the

03:15.032 --> 03:24.205
former Secretary of War, Victoriano Huerta, took 
over the government.

03:28.623 --> 03:32.750
Now, how did it happen that your family left 
Mexico? What time was it during the revolution

03:33.171 --> 03:36.817
that your family left? Do you want me to follow that 
Mexico City events? Why don't you go ahead and tell

03:42.226 --> 03:47.475
me when your family left Guerrero? In April 1913, 
Due to the threat of the revolutionaries, we left

03:52.703 --> 04:09.305
Guerrero in April 1913 and

03:52.703 --> 04:09.305
crossed into Zapata, Texas. Did you all come 
together? The family, just my mother and five

04:11.909 --> 04:14.713
children. My father had gone at night with my 
uncle. Well, why did your father have to leave at

04:18.995 --> 04:20.978
night? On account of the threat of the 
Revolutionary War threatening to take the town

04:20.998 --> 04:36.900
and assassinate my uncle, Sinecio Gutierrez, who 
was then the president in the city, which is like

04:20.998 --> 04:36.900
the mayor here in the United States. So we moved to 
Zapata in April, and then in August we moved to

04:38.322 --> 04:45.171
Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. and then we could enter the 
school. Then on December 1st, we moved to Laredo,

04:50.346 --> 04:57.426
Texas, and have been living here since. Why did you 
move from Nueva Laredo to Laredo? On account of the

05:01.250 --> 05:09.242
threat of the revolution too, that they were 
threatening to take over, the Carranza forces

05:01.250 --> 05:09.242
were threatening to take the town. Of Nuevo 
Laredo? Of Nuevo Laredo. Uh-huh. And your father,

05:11.986 --> 05:16.592
had he been for the Huerta government? No, no. He 
was a civilian. He was just a civilian. My uncle was

05:19.917 --> 05:21.499
the politician. Your uncle. Well, whose side was 
he on? With the Porfirio Díaz, and then the Madero

05:24.098 --> 05:32.290
government, and then the Huerta government, they 
tried to follow the line. But these were the

05:32.531 --> 05:35.195
legitimate federal governments. Because he was 
the president, he tried to follow the existing

05:35.215 --> 05:38.500
government. And that meant that the people who 
were against Huerta were after your uncle. Were

05:44.008 --> 05:45.310
after my uncle. Right. Then from there, when we 
moved to Laredo, Texas, that was in December 1913.

05:53.765 --> 06:02.696
Then on the last day of December of 1913, the 
Carranza forces attacked the city of Nuevo

05:53.765 --> 06:02.696
Laredo. After three days of fighting, the 
revolutionary forces withdrew. And then on April

06:08.984 --> 06:22.641
14, 1914, the Huerta forces, military forces, 
burned the...

06:24.089 --> 06:29.861
government buildings, including the Kostrop's 
house, bought it and left the town. Then a few days

06:30.562 --> 06:35.132
afterward, the Carranza forces took over the 
town. And then... Well, during that period, what

06:37.858 --> 06:45.253
was one of the first things you did in Laredo? Did 
you go right to school in Laredo? When we came to

06:47.934 --> 06:54.801
Laredo in January 1914, I went to a private school 
to learn English. How many years had you been to

06:56.023 --> 06:59.186
school in Mexico? Up to and including fifth grade. 
Fifth grade. That's where I learned the basic

07:03.911 --> 07:08.095
subjects. Then from the private school, I changed 
to the public school and then stayed through the

07:13.178 --> 07:22.789
fifth grade and quit to get to work. You did? Yeah, 
get to work. Life was hard at the time. So you went

07:27.774 --> 07:33.080
through fifth grade in Mexico and then you went 
through fifth grade in the United States. Well

07:33.941 --> 07:35.963
how, what sort of work did you do? I used to work with 
one of these money exchange offices that were very

07:36.685 --> 07:43.499
popular. I was the cashier and the janitor and 
earning two dollars a week. How old were you then?

07:52.330 --> 07:55.934
Very happy because I had a job to do. Life, 
everything was cheap at that time, including meat

07:57.016 --> 08:02.763
was 9 cents a pound. Oh, how wonderful. Flour was 3 
cents a pound. A loaf of bread, 5 cents. A suit of

08:08.350 --> 08:11.614
cloth, 12, 15 dollars. A pair of shoes, 2 or 3 
dollars. Life was very simple then. There were no

08:18.039 --> 08:22.447
automobiles, just a few automobiles at that time, 
1914.

08:25.133 --> 08:28.539
You want me to mention about the exodus of people? 
Yes. When we were in Nuevo Laredo, Every time there

08:32.103 --> 08:53.833
was a threat that the revolutionary forces would 
come to Nuevo Laredo, people would move to the

08:32.103 --> 08:53.833
American side,

08:32.103 --> 08:53.833
with all their meager belongings, and without any 
hindrance from the American authorities. They

08:54.874 --> 08:56.476
had free movement, back and forth. And things 
settled down, they moved back to Nuevo Laredo. But

09:00.723 --> 09:05.030
we made only one movement in December and stayed 
here. Why did your family stay here? Do you know?

09:08.977 --> 09:10.519
Let me tell you a story. When we came to Laredo, we 
moved to that tenement house. We arrived at about

09:15.428 --> 09:17.972
noon. That's where I saw that loaf of bread. It was a 
tenement house and a loaf of bread in a garbage can.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.333
At a tenement house? Tenement house. My goodness. 
It's owned by Dr. Saffirini in downtown. Do you

09:33.104 --> 09:34.125
know Laredo? Not that well. The rent was $7.80 a 
month. We worked here about a three or four room

09:40.415 --> 09:44.061
house. and they had a gas stove with two burners and 
an oven. Well, mother prepared supper, we had

09:52.569 --> 10:14.217
supper, we were five children, and my father, 
after we had supper, my mother told me years later,

09:52.569 --> 10:14.217
she said, when we had supper, I told Juvenal, who 
was my father, she said, Juvenal, I don't know what

09:52.569 --> 10:14.217
your plans are, But I'm not going back to Mexico 
with all these conveniences. I'm not going back to

10:20.191 --> 10:21.494
Mexico. We used to cover this mesquite charcoal 
Chips and petroleum stoves. So she says, I'm not

10:32.845 --> 10:36.130
going back to Mexico. This is the first guy's stove 
she'd ever cooked up. With all these

10:37.853 --> 10:39.015
conveniences. Very happy to have that 
convenience. Well, what was your family life like

10:42.921 --> 10:47.308
in Guerrero before the revolution? What did your 
father do? Well,

10:48.990 --> 10:56.522
she had a butcher shop first. And then he had a 
saloon. But it was not quite like these saloons.

11:01.933 --> 11:08.858
No, it was a place of reunion for the medium class 
people. in Guerrero. Sort of a place for the men to

11:11.496 --> 11:13.199
get together. It was a respectful place. Like in 
many small towns in Mexico. They had a billiard,

11:20.428 --> 11:24.934
and then a little gambling just to entertain 
themselves. There was nothing else to do in

11:25.334 --> 11:27.897
Guerrero. And your father's name now was? 
Juvenal. Juvenal Gutierrez. How long had he lived

11:33.965 --> 11:40.031
in Querétaro? My ancestors came from the city of 
Querétaro many, many years ago. One of my

11:48.820 --> 11:55.707
ancestors, an uncle, was General Bernardo 
Gutiérrez de Lara. He was governor of Tamaulipas

11:57.008 --> 12:01.693
during the independence. He went to Washington on 
horseback to get aid. But he said that the price

12:06.562 --> 12:10.368
that they asked was too high and told him, thanks, 
no. And then came back. And then when the movement

12:12.631 --> 12:25.909
of independence ended in 1925, Agustín de Turbide 
became emperor. And then after a year or so, people

12:27.779 --> 12:31.303
were discontent. They wanted a republic. So they 
exiled him. And then in his absence, Mexico

12:36.468 --> 12:44.697
enacted a law that if he ever came to Mexico, that he 
would be executed. But he didn't know anything

12:46.278 --> 12:47.840
about it. After two or three years, he came from 
Spain and landed in a place between Matamoros and

12:47.860 --> 12:55.508
Tampico. My uncle Bernardo Gutierrez was gone. He 
captured that man and executed him right away. He

13:02.398 --> 13:04.942
was the one that actually executed him? My uncle. 
And then afterward, after he had landed, Mexico

13:07.606 --> 13:18.420
issued a decree to spare his life and to send him to 
Mexico City. Said that it was too late, that he was

13:20.463 --> 13:22.772
Six feet from the ground. Oh, I had never heard that 
he was later spared. He was already dead.

13:30.520 --> 13:31.921
That's too bad. That was one uncle. Another uncle 
was a priest. He surveyed lots of lands here in

13:35.385 --> 13:42.872
these counties, and they still respect his 
surveys. Oh, during this time, of course, all this

13:43.372 --> 13:45.675
part of Texas. That was in 1910, 160 years ago. 
1810. 1810, during the War of Independence.

13:52.041 --> 13:55.484
Right, and that's when all this part of the country 
was still part of Mexico. Yes, and we came from

13:55.564 --> 13:58.026
another man. Our great-grandfather was Antonio. 
And he settled down in Monterrey and then in

14:00.490 --> 14:04.154
Guerrero. That's where we come from. My 
grandfather's name was Florencio Gutierrez.

14:11.263 --> 14:12.625
Awesome. How come so many people moved to 
Guerrero? Guerrero, in about 1900, the Mexican

14:15.508 --> 14:27.122
government issued a decree, designated a, what do 
you call it, section around the, all along the

14:28.351 --> 14:37.340
American border as a free, free, what do you call 
it? Free trade. Free trade. And all those people

14:39.663 --> 14:41.224
prospered. Guerrero was a prosperous town. They 
had trade with Nuevo Laredo, with Hebronville,

14:43.167 --> 14:52.096
with Corpus, with Matamoros, and the Rio Grande 
was navigable at that time. And the people that

14:56.347 --> 15:02.273
from Guerrero that lived in the little ranch towns 
came to Guerrero to have their babies born there.

15:03.134 --> 15:04.956
Because of the better medical facilities? 
Facilities and then their loyalty to Mexicans.

15:08.961 --> 15:13.325
They want to... Oh, you mean people from the United 
States would go to Guerrero? Yes, but the Mexican

15:13.345 --> 15:15.087
people. People who were on this side of the Rio 
Grande would go there so their babies would be born

15:15.508 --> 15:20.874
in Mexico. Because they... lived part of the time 
in Herrera and then had ranches here. And that was

15:29.107 --> 15:30.889
the custom there. This was back before the 
revolution. Oh, it was in 1890. In 1890. And then

15:36.355 --> 15:47.888
Mexico found out that it was just encouraging 
smuggling because all the stores along the water

15:36.355 --> 15:47.888
were filled up with American merchandise and it 
was easy to smuggle them into Mexico. So they, what

15:47.908 --> 15:51.953
do you call it, they canceled that. that law, and 
they can never renew it again. Well then, what did

15:56.883 --> 15:59.046
that do to Guerrero? It started to decay. It 
started to decay, and this was before the

16:01.068 --> 16:03.872
revolution? About 1900. About 1900, and so after 
that there was a decline. It started to decay, and

16:09.158 --> 16:13.603
when we left it had a population of about 4,000. And 
how many had it been? How many people had lived

16:15.269 --> 16:17.031
there, say, in 1900? The thing is, it was not so many 
people. The trade, it was a trade center, trade

16:20.155 --> 16:31.467
center, to bring the merchandise, and from there, 
they smuggled it into the terrain, and now in the

16:20.155 --> 16:31.467
interior of Mexico. At that time, the smugglers 
used to cut their trade by horseback. And then at

16:39.723 --> 16:44.573
that time, the coin was all silver pesos. They 
carried it with them. But the trade was carried in

16:48.201 --> 16:53.412
silver coins. What was the housing like then when 
you were growing up? The housing? Yeah. Houses

17:01.531 --> 17:03.474
were built to last forever. It took about two or 
three years to build a house out of rock. About

17:08.741 --> 17:11.284
three feet wide, the walls. And then the ceilings 
were about three or four feet deep. And they used

17:19.818 --> 17:25.165
them as fortresses to arrest the Indians. Was 
there trouble with Indians all along? Yes, at that

17:27.228 --> 17:28.970
time, sure. They had trouble with Indians back in 
1900. So those houses were built forever. And your

17:36.180 --> 17:39.705
family house that you grew up in, was it one of these 
stone houses? All the houses were made of rock. All

17:42.228 --> 17:42.729
the houses. Of course, the old guerrillas' 
destroyed now, decayed. What happened to it?

17:50.276 --> 18:03.715
Well, when they built the dam, it flooded the town, 
half of the town, and it was abandoned and built a

17:50.276 --> 18:03.715
new town, new Guerrero, just across from Falcón. 
But all Guerrero's gone. Well, it's gone and very

18:05.237 --> 18:10.224
few people live there. But life was very, it was 
very quiet and people like commune. very

18:17.547 --> 18:34.155
simple very simple in those days and then the 
revolution came i don't have any idea what would

18:17.547 --> 18:34.155
have happened to me there cannot be in the 
revolution i could be there a patriarch with about

18:35.215 --> 18:40.263
12 children and 40 grandchildren with a long 
beard. You might be. Did your family own land? Did

18:42.867 --> 18:43.749
your father have land? No. He didn't have any land? 
No, just our house. So he was really more of a

18:47.836 --> 18:50.400
merchant than a farmer. A merchant. Well, was he 
able to get out of Mexico with anything when he fled

18:51.702 --> 18:55.989
to Zapata? That was only because we had on, because 
we moved in the horse carriage. That was my mother

19:01.068 --> 19:05.174
and five children. So you weren't able to take 
anything with you? Everything was left. How did

19:09.120 --> 19:10.582
you get across the river? It was a total loss for us, 
like a millionaire that has a half a million

19:10.602 --> 19:15.369
council lost. We are just as bad, just as bad off as 
we were because he lost everything and we lost

19:15.769 --> 19:23.160
everything. We moved by carriage to Zapata, to the 
river. There was one of those chalans, they call

19:29.766 --> 19:34.774
it, ferry boats, but flat. They moved in with those 
big sticks that the gondoliers used. They moved to

19:39.481 --> 19:41.264
the American side. The same thing on the American 
side. Well, how come you went to Zapata? Because it

19:47.812 --> 19:48.853
was the closest place. It was the closest. Did you 
have any family in Zapata? I bought a man named

19:53.257 --> 19:59.964
Spone, who was the political chief in Zapata. He 
had a store, and he very graciously gave us the

20:00.164 --> 20:06.571
house to live there. He sold the house and he moved 
to the store. And he just gave it to you? That was the

20:10.855 --> 20:12.276
kind of man that he was. My goodness. I'll never 
forget that man. He was a merchant, because he was

20:15.571 --> 20:23.927
an acquaintance of my papa and my uncle. And he told 
me, you move to our house, and we stay there one

20:23.947 --> 20:29.157
week, and then move to the ranch. What was the name 
of the ranch you moved to? San Bartolo. It was one

20:35.365 --> 20:38.490
mile or two miles off the river. We used to walk from 
the ranch to Zapata once a week to buy groceries.

20:43.558 --> 20:44.619
Walk, just walk. What did your father do during 
this period to make a living? At that time there was

20:48.245 --> 20:52.051
a business of money exchange. He exchanged 
Mexican money to American back and forth. In

20:55.616 --> 20:56.277
Zapata? No, right here in Laredo. No, in Zapata we 
did nothing. He did nothing. And then when you got

21:01.663 --> 21:05.448
to Nueva Laredo, was he exchanging money then? We 
were exchanging money. Well, so your father had

21:06.829 --> 21:08.992
had some education too. Well, yes. Normal 
education. Normal education. What would a normal

21:13.297 --> 21:16.661
education be in Mexico in his generation? How many 
years of school do you think? Six or seven years.

21:19.965 --> 21:21.447
Six or seven. Very few people went to college. And 
see, during the... people would go to France for

21:26.277 --> 21:31.306
their education. There's much French influence 
in Mexico. They prefer the French schools. So only

21:43.349 --> 21:49.821
the very rich could afford to send their children 
to France. That was that resentment in Mexico

21:50.054 --> 21:52.538
always. And it was fake to us in school, in the tests 
and everything. That resentment against the

21:57.966 --> 22:00.409
United States. Against the United States? Sure, 
because of the territory that they took. I can

22:07.420 --> 22:09.683
never forget that. That's during the Mexican War 
in 1845. In 1836, when they took

22:12.505 --> 22:18.031
Texas first. First, right. Three years later, the 
other part of... All the rest of it, all the way to

22:19.172 --> 22:27.561
California. But there's one fact. When the 
Spaniards came to Mexico, Mexico was just a piece

22:31.946 --> 22:37.392
of land from Mexico City to Veracruz and Tampico. 
That was Mexico. And the Spanish came here and took

22:42.754 --> 22:48.404
over all this land up to San Francisco. So, in fact, 
Mexico didn't have anything. They didn't lose

22:51.910 --> 22:52.711
anything. When Mexico won the war, Spain just left 
all this by default, left all these lands, and

22:53.933 --> 23:04.290
Mexico took it. But in fact, they were not Mexican 
lines, they were Spanish, Spanish lines. So

23:11.964 --> 23:14.868
that's two sides to every question. But you did 
grow up with the idea that the United States was

23:17.112 --> 23:23.483
sort of, well, how would you describe it? 
Well-grounded, land-grounded. Land-grounded.

23:28.587 --> 23:32.132
Well, how did you feel then when you actually moved 
to the United States? Did that bother you?

23:33.033 --> 23:33.714
Different opinion. We saw the peaceful, the 
freedom that we have here, and then the facilities

23:34.475 --> 23:41.825
for education. We changed the picture. Like my 
mother said, I don't want to go back to Israel. But

23:49.748 --> 23:51.670
now, how many children were there in you? You said 
there were five children. Five born in Guerrero,

23:53.012 --> 23:55.435
five born here. Five more born here. And two 
children that died in infancy. There were ten in

23:59.700 --> 24:01.101
the family. Who was the oldest? I was the oldest. 
You were the oldest. Ten years old when you left

24:04.265 --> 24:06.027
Mexico. I was nineteen, thirteen, fourteen years 
old. Fourteen years old. And then...

24:13.778 --> 24:24.368
My father died in 1927, and then my mother died

24:13.778 --> 24:24.368
40 years later, in 1967. She was about 89 years old, 
in good health, but she was very methodical in her

24:24.408 --> 24:40.444
life, in her diet and everything, very 
methodical. Well, you said when you got here, you

24:41.875 --> 24:47.405
went then through some more schooling. You went to 
private school. Private school first to learn

24:48.867 --> 24:50.350
English. How did your family afford to send you to 
private school? Because it cost $2 or $3 a month.

24:55.860 --> 24:56.982
Oh, it wasn't expensive. And I walked from my house 
to the school. It was five blocks from there. That

25:00.869 --> 25:03.293
was Instituto Dominguez. They have the other 
business now. And then from there I moved to

25:07.107 --> 25:09.330
central school. When you came by Matamoros, you 
see a big school there. It was newly built when I

25:12.996 --> 25:15.559
moved. When I went there, I stayed there one year 
and a half. And then after the fifth day, I quit to

25:19.405 --> 25:27.677
help the family expenses. And you went to work 
exchanging money. Exchanging money. Well, when

25:31.298 --> 25:32.500
did you meet your wife? Exchanging money and 
janitor too. Everything. And cleaning hospitals

25:36.308 --> 25:38.893
and everything. How long did you work at that job? 
About a few years and then, you see, at that time

25:42.420 --> 25:50.256
there was a big market for Mexican silver coins in 
New York. And these agents would buy it and ship it

25:54.445 --> 25:58.414
to New York. I used to do that work, count that 
money, pack it, seal it, and then take it to the

25:58.855 --> 26:11.181
space to ship it to Zimmermann and Fossey, what the 
company did. broke many years ago. And then I took

26:13.228 --> 26:20.757
those bags of money, eight or ten bags of money, 
every evening to the bank for safekeeping until

26:13.228 --> 26:20.757
the next day. And then one day the cashier of the 
bank told me, I want you to come and work with us. I

26:27.005 --> 26:29.087
told him, but I don't work with Mr. Cardenas. No, he 
said, I talked to him. He said, you can work with us.

26:32.612 --> 26:35.635
After you get through with us, you can go and work 
with him. And that's the arrangement we made. I

26:38.298 --> 26:41.202
started to work for $35 a month. And what year was 
that? 1918. 1918. Well, that was a pretty good

26:45.681 --> 26:48.985
salary in 1918, wasn't it? $30, $35. $35 a month. 
And then when they started the draft here, I raised

26:52.088 --> 27:01.497
it and it was placed in fifth class, which was 
clerical work. At that time it was very important,

27:01.657 --> 27:04.540
clerical work. So in November the work ended and I 
didn't sell it. And then in the next war, in 1941, I

27:10.240 --> 27:14.225
was 42 years old. I was married, I had four 
children. So I was placed in another fifth class or

27:16.287 --> 27:19.090
something. I never had to serve. But my boys, one of 
them, he was serving the reserve. And then the

27:28.040 --> 27:36.450
little one, the engineer, entered the Air Force in 
Lackland. But he broke a knee or something, and

27:36.920 --> 27:42.166
they told him, if we operate, we can keep to here. By 
that time, he had his degree in engineering. And we

27:45.410 --> 27:47.954
can keep, if you don't want, we'll have to 
discharge it. Said, give me the discharge.

27:52.299 --> 27:57.786
And then the other one, Carlos, was married with 
three children, so they didn't touch him. They

27:57.846 --> 27:59.888
didn't touch him. You've been lucky about that. 
Yes. Well, when did you meet your wife? You said you

28:05.661 --> 28:08.764
wouldn't have met your wife if it hadn't been for 
the revolution. Because we met here. They had a

28:10.426 --> 28:12.308
kindergarten. And my little sister was a student 
there. I started to see her. And then one Labor Day,

28:17.172 --> 28:30.786
back in 1933, we went to Monterey, my sister, 
herself, to Monterey. I had a little... Chevrolet

28:32.962 --> 28:35.386
car at that time, new car. We spent two or three days 
there. And when we came back, we became engaged.

28:40.793 --> 28:43.177
And in November, we got married. 1933. I thought we 
had a very good life. How did it happen that your

28:49.186 --> 28:52.270
wife had come to Laredo? You see, they were the 
Carranza people. So long as the revolution was

28:55.058 --> 28:57.702
going on, they were doing all right. That's her 
family. They were pro-Carranza. Because his

29:00.706 --> 29:04.932
father was with the Carranza administration. He 
was a collector of... What do you call this? State

29:11.902 --> 29:13.905
collector of taxes. No, federal collector of 
taxes in Monterrey. And what was his name?

29:20.915 --> 29:22.678
You see, you cut me there. Oh, what was his last 
name? His last name. Garza. Garza. Garza. Then

29:33.593 --> 29:36.575
when Carranza was killed, he died. He had a heart 
attack in Monterrey. So the family moved to Nuevo

29:40.859 --> 29:45.963
Laredo and opened a kindergarten. This was in 
Nuevo Laredo. Nuevo Laredo, kindergarten. Then

29:48.826 --> 29:53.830
from Nuevo Laredo, they moved to Laredo, Texas, 
and got the kindergarten downtown. Then they, you

29:54.687 --> 30:01.214
see I just, through my sister, I got to see them. 
There were five sisters and she was the prettiest

30:01.855 --> 30:06.380
one.

30:09.424 --> 30:13.949
But you don't think they would ever have moved to 
Nuevo Loreto if it hadn't been for the revolution?

30:14.009 --> 30:15.751
No, their father had lived. It was one of those 
circumstances. Just a matter of chance. Like I

30:19.475 --> 30:20.256
say. We lost everything in the revolution, but I 
gave my wife. And all three children, she raised

30:28.087 --> 30:31.831
them like gentlemen. Very obedient. They called 
us on telephone quite often, and we go and visit

30:34.754 --> 30:40.940
them. We have a good life. We have good 
daughters-in-law. You see, making allowances

30:47.006 --> 30:51.070
for everything. We have good relations. So your 
oldest son, let's see, what does he do now? He's

30:57.827 --> 31:02.835
with the Massachusetts Insurance Company in 
Houston. And his name is? Massachusetts is

31:03.917 --> 31:07.803
Florencio Gutierrez Jr. In the last four years, he 
has sold more than $1 million in insurance. My

31:14.173 --> 31:14.834
goodness. This was the president's club. Every 
year they send him to... Springfield,

31:19.349 --> 31:22.992
Massachusetts to take courses. And then every 
year they have a convention in San Francisco,

31:23.012 --> 31:32.802
Puerto Rico, and he takes his wife with him to have a 
week of fun. Oh, how wonderful. And he was an Aggie.

31:36.065 --> 31:37.065
He was A&M. He was about three years studying

31:37.126 --> 31:46.234
petroleum engineering. But he could not make it. 
He said, Father, I cannot make it. I'm going to

31:50.131 --> 31:50.832
quit. And then he moved to Houston. But he's a born, 
born safe man. He has been doing very well. And then

32:00.789 --> 32:03.514
your second son is Carlos. Carlos. He... went to 
the University of Houston. He first went to East

32:07.808 --> 32:11.593
Texas, I don't know. What's the name, Conroe or 
East Texas? It's Nacogdoches, I think. No, that's

32:17.400 --> 32:18.602
another town. Comer's. Comer's. Comer's. And 
then he went to the University of Texas. And then,

32:25.851 --> 32:31.037
while he was in high school, he knew this country. 
My wife's sister married Mr. Adolf Kahn, who used

32:31.658 --> 32:41.778
to be the assistant customs collector here in 
Laredo. And then Mr. Kahn, his first wife died and

32:42.920 --> 32:49.633
left him two boys and one girl. And then he married 
my wife's sister. And they have a boy and a girl. And

32:55.944 --> 33:01.711
then through that relationship we know the 
Luisa's parents. We got together during forest

33:02.132 --> 33:06.818
and everything and that's how they met. And then 
they got married when he was 20 years old.

33:12.530 --> 33:15.975
Fortunately, we had fathers on both sides. We had 
to tie them up. Finally, they are on their own now.

33:21.823 --> 33:22.885
And what does he do now? He's with the shipping 
agents there called Le Parc Blanc Company. They

33:34.180 --> 33:37.585
are shipping brokers. And he's the second man in 
the office. the owner and himself, and then

33:41.335 --> 33:45.899
personal 14 or 15 employees. And then your 
youngest son is? That's engineer, civil

33:47.841 --> 33:49.903
engineer. He started with the highway 
department. And then after four years, he got his

33:54.427 --> 33:59.131
license to be on his own. And then in Houston, he has 
a big

34:00.432 --> 34:11.342
part of the expressway that he designed in 
Houston. And then he left the highway department

34:12.048 --> 34:20.862
to be and went into partnership with a surveyor. 
They stayed to work two or three years. And then he

34:24.708 --> 34:28.053
did very well and they dissolved the partnership. 
And then went to work with the Dow Company. And then

34:33.401 --> 34:37.768
for a year or so and then he quit and now he joined 
another partner. of architects. And now he's

34:40.433 --> 34:41.955
doing very well. What is his name? Alberto. 
Alberto David Gutierrez. They are living now in

34:47.003 --> 34:49.688
Memorial Park. You know, in Houston. Yes, yes. 
That's a very nice section. They're renting a

34:54.756 --> 34:55.857
house. They have a house and they sold it. Now they 
want to buy another one, but it costs too much. The

35:02.107 --> 35:05.072
more you wait, the more it will cost you. That's 
true. Well, your brothers and sisters, did they

35:08.019 --> 35:12.966
all stay in the United States too? Yes, everyone. 
One brother, he moved to Mexico City with my boss, a

35:14.908 --> 35:22.298
man named Francisco Cárdenas. Mr. Cárdenas was 
from Nuevo León, and he became governor of Nuevo

35:23.740 --> 35:29.248
León. First he was a senator in the Congress, and 
then my brother moved with him just to help him and

35:29.268 --> 35:36.257
everything. and then he became governor of 
Malayalam. And then he died in Mexico, married

35:41.468 --> 35:45.153
there, and died in Mexico City. So there was one 
that went... All the rest of them lived here in the

35:45.453 --> 35:47.916
States. Was he one of the ones that had been born in 
Mexico? Yes. He was the second in the family. So he

35:54.425 --> 35:56.408
went back, but everybody else stayed. Well, do you 
ever go back to Mexico? Do you go to Mexico to visit

35:58.731 --> 36:00.593
much? Do you go to Mexico to visit? Yes, quite 
often, every year. To Mexico City several times.

36:07.878 --> 36:11.602
in conventions, bank conventions, and custom 
brokers conventions. We have been to different

36:12.022 --> 36:20.110
towns, to Guanajuato, Acapulco, Mazatlan, 
Mexico City, Guadalajara. We have visited all

36:20.591 --> 36:24.615
those places during the conventions. But we like 
it to go just for pleasure, not to live. Well, why

36:28.899 --> 36:30.400
wouldn't you want to live there? Because we are 
used to this kind of life, quiet life. all the

36:35.266 --> 36:44.778
freedom that we want, the freedom of expression, 
and then the security in our own lives. And then the

36:44.798 --> 36:47.081
sanitation. You go to Mexico City, you can get sick 
by drinking a glass of water or a salad or

36:47.101 --> 36:56.032
something. But do you feel like the revolution was 
a good thing in the long run for Mexico? It was

36:59.776 --> 37:00.677
justified. It cost too much in lives and property 
but it had to come. Like I said, General Porfirio

37:06.607 --> 37:23.245
Díaz maintained the country in peace, but the

37:06.607 --> 37:23.245
country could not develop because the main 
resources were in the hands of a few hands, his own

37:06.607 --> 37:23.245
general. Then the railroads and the mines were 
owned by the British and the oil companies.

37:29.733 --> 37:34.618
American companies owned the oil companies too, 
and then the The transportation was owned by

37:35.206 --> 37:43.534
Canadians and irrigation systems by Canadians 
and British. So all the main industries, basic

37:43.554 --> 37:49.160
industries, were owned by foreigners. So it was 
kept in the, what do you call it, in the undeveloped

37:50.181 --> 37:57.488
state. They wanted to get the riches, the profits 
from Mexico. So just ordinary people didn't have a

38:03.370 --> 38:05.613
chance. That's what I say. Not to get the 
opportunity for jobs. When Mexico expropriated

38:12.663 --> 38:17.410
the oil companies, they demanded indemnity. But 
in justice, the companies ought to have paid

38:17.690 --> 38:22.577
Mexico instead of getting... Why? Because during 
the revolution of Carranza, the American

38:22.977 --> 38:29.707
companies engaged a man, Mexican general. I don't 
remember what was his name. They recruited about

38:32.277 --> 38:42.206
two or three thousand men, well equipped, well 
armed and everything, to protect the oil

38:32.277 --> 38:42.206
companies. And that happened for about five or six 
years during the revolution. And that was during

38:47.410 --> 38:49.372
the World War. So they took all the oil from Mexico. 
Mexico never got a cent of revenue for that, for all

38:51.914 --> 38:56.498
those years. They just kept that money in power 
until things became stabilized. So injustice was

39:02.770 --> 39:07.316
a good move. The oil companies had to carry a better 
attitude or something. They never spent a cent for

39:15.767 --> 39:20.133
building schools, hospitals, or anything. And 
then the executives lived like kings, segregated

39:21.095 --> 39:26.942
from the rest of the people. So those conditions 
cannot last in any question. So one thing brought

39:31.424 --> 39:35.128
the other thing. And you feel like Lázaro Cárdenas 
was really justified in the expropriation. And he

39:40.195 --> 39:42.698
should not have paid them anything. Well, you've 
talked about some of these men. You were telling me

39:45.741 --> 39:51.448
that Villa wasn't, that he was sort of a bandit. 
What do you feel about Villa? That's what I say.

39:54.091 --> 39:54.532
Pancho Villa. You know, just a bandit. The 
revolution came, it was an opportunity for them

39:56.474 --> 40:01.380
to... to wage vengeance on the other people. He 
kept that fellow Luis Terrazas, that

40:07.155 --> 40:10.860
millionaire, with him always. And he blackmailed 
him, took all that he could with him. Finally he

40:19.934 --> 40:21.076
released him. But he was just a bandit like anybody 
else. And then they remember when Pancho Villa

40:26.744 --> 40:30.490
attacked Columbus. back in 1916, out of revenge 
for, it's said that the United States, President

40:30.740 --> 40:45.858
Wilson called, double-crossed him. As a result of 
that, Mexico and the United States had a treaty

40:46.358 --> 40:56.190
that in case of an invasion from bandits, each 
country had the right to invade the other country

40:56.542 --> 41:03.752
to, in hot, for Saudi people, but with a troop, 
troops not to exceed 500 men. So, American people

41:05.454 --> 41:13.144
sent Pershing with 500 men, but before you know, 
they had two or three thousand soldiers already.

41:14.145 --> 41:20.394
And Pancho Villa used to be in the mountains 
watching, watching them, looking for him. And

41:20.414 --> 41:25.080
then they went so deep in looking for him, they went 
to, to the state of Durango. Finally they had a

41:30.863 --> 41:34.068
clash with the Mexican troops. Then finally they 
recalled Pershing to make him commander of the

41:35.049 --> 41:43.239
expeditionary forces in Europe. And finally the 
United States withdrew the troops and Pancho

41:43.560 --> 41:49.988
Villa never was caught. Now, how did you learn so 
much about Mexican history? Because I was always

41:52.755 --> 41:54.217
interested. I read papers, magazines, and 
everything. So you just sort of kept up with it? I

41:59.703 --> 42:00.644
kept up with it. I like to keep pace with history, 
and then the European history, too. I remember it

42:06.711 --> 42:15.041
was in August 1914 when they killed that, what was 
the Russian general? Austrian. in Sarajevo that

42:17.778 --> 42:22.222
started the revolution. Of course, that was a 
pretext. The war had to come anyway. It was going to

42:25.725 --> 42:29.789
come because of Germany's ambition. You see, the 
ambition of Vienna was to have a line of

42:31.010 --> 42:40.378
communication through

42:31.010 --> 42:40.378
Constantinople. They wanted to build a railroad. 
There was the alliance between Germany Italy and

42:47.883 --> 42:55.837
Austria on one side, and then England, France and 
Russia on the other side. And then when the war

42:55.857 --> 43:10.903
came, then the United States just dashed his 
ambition to dominate the world, and again in 1941.

43:12.267 --> 43:17.413
And during that period, during World War I, 
though, there were a lot of German agents in

43:12.267 --> 43:17.413
Mexico, you were telling me. That's what I mean, 
because of the resentment. So they allowed them to

43:19.575 --> 43:24.421
operate in Mexico. You see, they had some sort of, 
when the ships left the port, they would sink them

43:24.441 --> 43:34.392
with U.S. U-boats, as they called them. So it was a 
thorn on the side for the United States. And during

43:41.478 --> 43:44.342
this period, of course, you were here in Laredo. 
One thing I didn't find out, did you actually see

43:44.622 --> 43:48.188
any battles? Did you actually see any battles when 
you were growing up? Well, in Laredo, we would just

43:52.974 --> 44:01.967
watch the shooting and everything, and the 
soldiers would go to houses and see them moving

43:52.974 --> 44:01.967
around. when they attacked Nuevo Lareo, but Nuevo 
Lareo was very well fortified. They never got too

44:08.084 --> 44:17.281
close to the... Of course at that time the 
revolutionaries didn't have any guns, just

44:08.084 --> 44:17.281
rifles. And this, the government troops, they had 
cannon, cavalry, infantry. So they could not take

44:24.408 --> 44:27.753
it. They killed about 3,000 Carrasistas and they 
burned them there in the big fire.

44:36.006 --> 44:43.017
Now it was very, very

44:36.006 --> 44:43.017
painful for Mexico to have this revolution. And 
economically it has grown. Politically it came

44:46.983 --> 44:49.687
back to the old regime. Oh, really? Same thing. 
political party that nominates all the

44:52.319 --> 44:56.686
candidates. They call the other opposition 
party. But it's only pretence to pretend that

45:00.693 --> 45:05.180
there is democracy. Politically the same thing, 
but economically it has grown. What do you think

45:13.213 --> 45:15.897
the reason for the economic growth is? Well, the 
position that it has in Mexico-Casa, the natural

45:16.855 --> 45:24.505
resources, then the people that are being 
educated.

45:30.433 --> 45:35.159
They've got a good practice building red road 
bridges. They've got so many. They're experts at

45:37.623 --> 45:38.644
that. This bridge over here, the one on the 
Mexicans, the new bridge was built by Mexicans,

45:39.012 --> 45:48.844
designed and built by Mexicans, the pedestrian 
bridge. So they are well experienced in that. Have

45:53.289 --> 45:58.436
you traveled on the Pacific from El Paso to 
Mazatlán? No, I haven't done that yet. They have a

46:00.138 --> 46:04.243
beautiful railroad there built by Mexicans too. 
So many tunnels and then canyons, big canyons.

46:08.948 --> 46:13.616
It's a civic route from Chihuahua to Mochis. We 
traveled that once. It's a beautiful city. All

46:17.824 --> 46:21.951
built by these Indians, what do you call them? 
Tarahumara Indians.

46:25.698 --> 46:27.902
Do you think the Indians are getting more 
educated?
