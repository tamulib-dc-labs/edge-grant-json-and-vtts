00:02.461 --> 00:13.015
And he was telling that the university 
administration thinks that McDonald either lies

00:02.461 --> 00:13.015
to them or is incompetent to give them a straight 
answer about how much something is going to cost.

00:13.035 --> 00:13.596
So continue. So in the early days of the 300-inch 
project, where Pete Flan was president and Harlan

00:14.037 --> 00:25.532
was pushing it very hard, the...

00:26.457 --> 00:38.316
In my opinion, and I've never had Pete Flawn say 
this one way or another, or Jerry Falcon say it, who

00:26.457 --> 00:38.316
had become Flawn's vice president for research 
and then later executive vice president provost.

00:39.879 --> 00:44.246
In my opinion, they made us jump through so many 
hoops. They wanted outside reviews on a number of

00:45.408 --> 00:50.676
occasions. were extraordinarily cautious in 
believing the information we sent up to them. And

00:55.971 --> 01:04.450
then in my opinion, that delayed the project so 
long that the oil crunch in Texas happened and

00:55.971 --> 01:04.450
killed it. And that, I've said to other people 
that, Without Harlan Smith, there would never,

01:10.062 --> 01:14.307
ever have been a 300-inch project. With Harlan 
Smith, it was impossible to accomplish a 300-inch

01:14.767 --> 01:26.721
telescope project because the relations between 
him and the administration were such that it took

01:14.767 --> 01:26.721
too damn long to develop it. We almost had the same 
problem with the SST. We began involvement in the

01:30.145 --> 01:32.988
SST in 1985. We started talking with Penn State. In 
1987, we entered into an agreement with them. But

01:42.889 --> 01:58.874
as late as 1992, the UT administration, with a new 
president, same vice president for research,

01:42.889 --> 01:58.874
were having difficulty believing anything we 
told them. And we almost lost the SST, even after

01:58.894 --> 02:05.044
Harlan, because of that history that had been 
built up. they i think quite literally they simply

02:05.497 --> 02:29.513
did not trust him they respected his his 
incredible entrepreneurial ability and they

02:05.497 --> 02:29.513
they respected his ability to communicate with 
the public they respected his ability to raise

02:05.497 --> 02:29.513
money and to convince people of the rightness of 
the programs he was pursuing but i literally

02:05.497 --> 02:29.513
believe they did not trust him uh After my wife and I 
lived most of the last 10 years up in New England,

02:30.050 --> 02:48.308
and frankly, what anybody knows about the 
University of Texas, not just from Stardate, but

02:30.050 --> 02:48.308
from McDonald Observatory, that's what the 
University of Texas is known for in that part of the

02:30.050 --> 02:48.308
country and in the Midwest, too, where all my 
ancestors are. Do you think the administration at

02:50.170 --> 02:55.095
UT appreciates that?

02:57.016 --> 02:58.878
Well, the administration at UT just changed. 
We're now on about the fifth president since I've

03:01.061 --> 03:04.546
been there. They come and they go. The new 
president, I can't say if he does or not, but I can

03:05.267 --> 03:20.847
tell you this, that I'm optimistic because at the 
first Board of Visitors meeting that we had in

03:05.267 --> 03:20.847
February, at which the new president took over in 
January, Robert Berdahl, who came from the

03:05.267 --> 03:20.847
University of Illinois, He stood up in front of it 
and he said, long before I ever knew that I would

03:21.552 --> 03:34.544
show up here at the University of Texas as 
president, I had enjoyed listening on the radio in

03:21.552 --> 03:34.544
Illinois to Stardate. And he said, I'm really 
appreciative of what the observatory does in that

03:35.946 --> 03:41.271
regard. So he obviously had started out on the 
right foot. The previous president, Bill

03:48.502 --> 03:52.968
Cunningham was very strongly supportive of us all 
during his term. And without him, the

03:53.809 --> 03:57.434
spectroscopic survey telescope would have died. 
The president before that was Pete Flan. And one of

04:00.058 --> 04:05.004
the first things he said, I can remember driving 
across town and hearing it on my radio in my car. He

04:05.104 --> 04:08.128
was giving a halftime talk at a football game. They 
were interviewing him at halftime, not a talk. He

04:12.294 --> 04:13.075
was being interviewed. And they asked that 
question, what are the preeminent programs at UT

04:13.527 --> 04:18.172
Austin now that you've just taken over as 
president? And the first one out of his mouth was

04:18.452 --> 04:29.164
the McDonald Observatory and the Department of 
Astronomy program is preeminent as a jewel in our

04:18.452 --> 04:29.164
crown, or some words to that effect. So I think the 
presidents have had an appreciation for the

04:29.184 --> 04:35.811
excellence of the program in astronomy at Texas. I 
think as money gets tighter and tighter, they

04:36.312 --> 04:42.859
are...

04:43.345 --> 04:49.256
There's a little bit of the climate, what have you 
done for us lately type of attitude, which they

04:43.345 --> 04:49.256
have to take. They have to decide what's strong 
today, not what was strong 10 or 20 years ago.

04:53.103 --> 04:54.165
What's strong today? And how is that going to help 
this university? And so we have to continually

04:56.830 --> 04:58.694
read. 50 years ago, Harvard was the preeminent 
astronomy department. But them days is gone

05:02.040 --> 05:05.286
forever.
