This

00:01.600 --> 00:10.409
is Marilee Nolan interviewing Frank Galvan.

00:13.172 --> 00:13.893
Where is your mic? You don't need one. It's right 
there. Very sensitive. All right, if you could

00:21.060 --> 00:25.445
begin with your name and where you were born, your 
age.

00:28.388 --> 00:31.371
My name is Frank J. Galvan, Jr. I was born in Santa 
Barbara, Chihuahua, Mexico on February the 8th,

00:32.313 --> 00:43.045
the 11th, 1908.

00:44.987 --> 00:47.971
And I am 65 years of age. And when did you leave 
Mexico? We left Mexico sometime in the middle of

00:52.476 --> 01:01.206
1913.

01:04.105 --> 01:17.142
We

01:04.105 --> 01:17.142
left Mexico from our point of origin, which was 
Santa Barbara, Chihuahua, Mexico. My father had

01:17.162 --> 01:29.978
been a government, federal employee

01:17.162 --> 01:29.978
in the city of Santa Barbara. and at the outbreak of 
the revolution he was branded as a uh

01:31.645 --> 02:00.640
things got a little dangerous for him so he fled 
from santa barbara to chihuahua incognito and

01:31.645 --> 02:00.640
from chihuahua it is believe that he left as far 
from Mexico as possible and I am under the

02:00.957 --> 02:23.129
impression that he finally reached his 
destination somewhere in Canada.

02:23.149 --> 02:26.955
Go on.

02:27.155 --> 02:29.158
Did you and your family go with him then? No.

02:32.458 --> 02:44.830
He left the family all in the city of the town of 
Santa Barbara, Chihuahua. And we had a home, a

02:45.070 --> 02:51.816
two-story home. And while he was away for some, it 
looked to me like it was years, We were penniless,

02:58.703 --> 03:19.165
poverty-stricken, and had to

02:58.703 --> 03:19.165
exist by converting the upper story of the house 
into a rooming house. There was a yard in the center

03:20.526 --> 03:27.934
of the house and a second yard to the rear that used 
to be called two patios. One for the servants and

03:33.804 --> 03:39.493
the other ones for the members of the household.

03:43.219 --> 03:54.015
Anyway, we managed to exist during the revolution 
by selling hierba buena. We used to, there was a

03:54.035 --> 03:56.419
farm nearby
