WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:31.843
Right, yeah, this was, I believe it was in 79 when 
Charlie Holland and I got together with Bob

00:01.988 --> 00:31.843
Walker, who was director of development here at 
A&M, still active, and we formed the Lindsay

00:01.988 --> 00:31.843
Lectures Committee, and we raised about $30,000

00:01.988 --> 00:31.843
from the former students in order that we could 
bring in top lectures in chemical engineering,

00:32.887 --> 00:49.843
and our real purpose was trying to get the 
department to be better known, because at that

00:32.887 --> 00:49.843
time the department had become reasonably 
strong, but it was still pretty much unknown

00:32.887 --> 00:49.843
throughout the North and East. And so we 
deliberately targeted all the chemical

00:51.564 --> 01:00.092
engineers that were members of the National 
Academy of Engineering, for example, to bring

00:51.564 --> 01:00.092
them in here. for a lecture so they would at least 
know where we were and who we were.

01:09.280 --> 01:25.928
But that was really the first committee of our 
outstanding former students, and it's the

01:09.280 --> 01:25.928
forerunner of the committee we have now that's 
actually called a, it's called an industrial

01:09.280 --> 01:25.928
advisory committee. The Lindsay Lecturers 
Committee was the forerunner of that, and it was

01:27.157 --> 01:37.869
sort of the first group of students, too, that went 
out to try to help us raise money. And then later, we

01:39.671 --> 01:48.641
used this group to raise more major money. We 
raised about, in total, about $250,000.

01:57.211 --> 01:59.174
later, but this was into the early 80s. And that's 
what set up the C.D. Holland Professorship that's

02:05.744 --> 02:10.591
held at Ray Anthony now. And also as part of that, 
there's the Brunner Barnes Graduate

02:10.611 --> 02:25.092
Assistantship,

02:10.611 --> 02:25.092
and there's another, I can just call it Chemical 
Engineering Alumni Graduate Fellowship. And

02:26.320 --> 02:37.774
that was back in the days when at Texas A&M, if you 
raised money from outside sources, the board of

02:26.320 --> 02:37.774
directors would match it. So those monies were all 
matched back for university money.

02:45.683 --> 02:47.625
That's good. The department really has done a good

02:47.645 --> 02:54.273
job in what I can tell. Building an industry 
connection, using the industry connection, And

02:56.257 --> 03:02.543
it's complimenting

02:56.257 --> 03:02.543
everybody. It's complimenting everyone.

03:09.870 --> 03:11.912
OK, that's really good to know. If you were going to 
suggest a striking difference or a character of

03:13.773 --> 03:26.145
Holland's style as opposed to Newton's, would you 
agree with that or not? Well, no, I worked very well

03:26.547 --> 03:33.216
with both of them. Of

03:33.917 --> 03:52.082
course, when I first came, Doc Winsley was in the 
latter part of his tenure as department head, and

03:33.917 --> 03:52.082
of course I was just a young professor. But I did 
almost immediately take on a lot of the odd jobs in

03:52.855 --> 03:58.041
the department. And that was Charlie Holland's 
relief, because Charlie was way behind writing

03:58.361 --> 04:07.451
research papers and doing a lot of other things. So 
when Charlie became head, the style is totally

04:09.012 --> 04:16.500
different.

04:20.565 --> 04:22.727
And I have one document in here that I I wrote up for 
Charlie Holland's retirement that says some

04:23.163 --> 04:32.011
things about Charlie.

04:36.696 --> 04:45.084
Charlie's way of writing the department was a 
little different in that Charlie really liked to

04:36.696 --> 04:45.084
write textbooks.

04:47.606 --> 04:51.550
Being head of the department, I don't think, was 
Charlie's great ambition. And he was quite good at

04:51.850 --> 04:54.636
it. But Charlie would get up at 3 o'clock every 
morning and write on textbooks until about 7 and

04:55.056 --> 05:03.894
would come in here. He liked to have 7 o'clock 
classes, which the students didn't appreciate.

05:09.525 --> 05:13.032
But Charlie was definitely a very early morning 
guy. And then by the afternoon, Charlie would have

05:14.125 --> 05:20.173
to go to all those damn department head meetings, 
and you name it. And by that time, it was evening for

05:20.193 --> 05:30.127
Charlie, and he could halfway sleep through them, 
which was just exactly part of his plan. Then he

05:30.187 --> 05:34.893
would go home, and he would be in bed bait upon. So 
anyway, that's the way Charlie ran things.

05:41.943 --> 05:42.664
And I became... I think after a few years, I became, 
well, Charlie's right-hand man, or maybe his

05:43.808 --> 05:51.375
hatchet man. But anyway, and so I started doing a 
lot of things that department heads often do. I

06:05.589 --> 06:11.335
became in charge of hiring all the faculty, which I 
did for a long time.

06:13.508 --> 06:25.084
I think I hired, the last time I counted, I still had 
hired 13 of the present 25, but almost all the,

06:13.508 --> 06:25.084
quote, older guys here, I think I hired.

06:26.906 --> 06:33.335
And that was another period where we started to 
hire, we hired a lot of people. And in about, it

06:34.096 --> 06:42.908
could be off by a year, but in about 1975,

06:43.411 --> 06:45.854
76, probably. In 75, I hired Dick Hall or Ken Hall 
here. But then Charlie said, you've got to hire

06:51.801 --> 06:58.168
five people in one year, and I about went berserk. I 
didn't think that could be done. But I did hire

07:01.152 --> 07:02.634
three people. I hired Ralph Light, Jim Holsey, and 
Charlie Glover. And those three all worked out

07:10.142 --> 07:12.405
extremely well. Ralph White's now department 
head at South Carolina, so he did leave A&M about

07:13.364 --> 07:22.814
three years ago, but they've all worked out. And 
then later I hired some people I shouldn't have,

07:24.376 --> 07:31.504
because I was trying to hire too many people. We 
were expanding very fast there in the late 70s. Our

07:38.551 --> 07:41.835
student population had gone completely out of 
hand. As a matter of fact, when I came back from

07:42.912 --> 07:51.003
sabbatical, I had a sabbatical at Imperial 
College in London from 1971 to 1972. When I came

07:51.063 --> 08:11.350
back from London, our student population was 
already getting out of hand, so one of the things I

07:51.063 --> 08:11.350
did in 1973, 1974, and 1975 and there, I brought in 
professors from England just to come here and

07:51.063 --> 08:11.350
teach for a year, because the salary structure in 
England was so terrible that We could pay them far

08:11.988 --> 08:13.450
more money. It still wasn't that much money. And 
they'd come in and teach three courses. And we were

08:17.314 --> 08:26.244
just trying to keep our heads above water, because 
we were faced with a tremendous number of

08:17.314 --> 08:26.244
students. And I think at one time, we actually got 
up to 1,400 undergraduates.

08:33.492 --> 08:38.437
And we were still a faculty that was around 12 
people. And it was just getting out of hand.

08:43.510 --> 08:49.166
So Charlie actually gave me almost parts of his 
job. Of course, this was all done under mutual

08:51.152 --> 08:58.954
agreement, but as Charlie and I laughed about this 
often, I told him, well, if you If you ever disagree

08:59.153 --> 09:02.757
with me on a major policy, I'll quit." So, I mean, 
you understand, you know, I do have to have your

09:02.777 --> 09:11.546
support, and, you know, if I'm going to do these 
jobs. Well, he said, I like to designate, to

09:11.566 --> 09:15.471
delegate my authority, you know. Well, Charlie 
was, he was really very good about that. And, of

09:18.033 --> 09:28.705
course, Charlie was very, you know, good at 
keeping the faculty happy and, you know, being,

09:18.033 --> 09:28.705
talking to them. But Charlie really didn't like a 
lot of the day-to-day operation and

09:29.832 --> 09:38.263
administration of the department. He didn't 
enjoy that. He liked to talk to people. He's a very

09:41.848 --> 09:48.997
extroverted person.

09:49.397 --> 09:53.362
We did a lot of things by committee. And I also 
started, I'm sure of the exact date, but started

09:57.777 --> 10:10.601
the tenure and promotion committee in that.

10:10.621 --> 10:17.254
That was,

10:10.621 --> 10:17.254
I think, it may have been in the early 80's.

10:28.118 --> 10:28.919
Right. No, that's further back. Sorry about that. 
Yeah, we started in 1974.

10:35.349 --> 10:41.339
I started as first chairman and all that. I'm 
chairman of it again, just this year.

10:43.682 --> 10:44.443
Congratulations. Again. Congratulations. Been 
away from it for a while. 25

10:47.448 --> 10:51.274
years later.

10:54.477 --> 10:59.542
And we did hire, at that time, a number of quite good 
people, too. We later hired Ted Watson, hired

10:59.923 --> 11:20.704
Drago Bucher here,

10:59.923 --> 11:20.704
and Iden Aukerman, also, who's now the social 
department head. He's also had a very good career.

11:26.433 --> 11:29.637
But yeah, we've hired quite a number of good 
people.

11:32.440 --> 11:41.329
Several of them have left to become department 
heads at other schools.

11:41.369 --> 11:43.271
Who is playing? Yes, that is almost a story within 
itself. And let me provide it, because I'm

11:47.650 --> 11:50.093
probably one of the few people. In fact, I'm 
probably the only person here that can provide the

11:50.113 --> 11:54.079
story. I'm trying to make it reasonably brief. But 
Dan Pham took a PhD at MIT. And he was also one of the

12:02.611 --> 12:07.378
early people that I hired. And Dan is

12:08.700 --> 12:14.928
technically a genius. I mean, really a bright guy. 
But anyway, Dan is, to say the least, a little

12:17.722 --> 12:22.689
abrasive. And he's a classic New York City boy, 
perhaps, but not to offend anybody. And I've

12:33.224 --> 12:36.949
always, myself, I sort of like that.

12:40.154 --> 12:45.501
But Dan did not get along with anybody else here too 
well. And we used to go over, Fred Benson would have

12:46.848 --> 12:55.120
us all come over once a year for sort of a review and 
just to chat with the dean. And I got along very well

12:56.182 --> 13:02.812
with Fred, who's another one of my really favorite 
people. And so Charlie Holland always would send

13:03.012 --> 13:09.221
me over right after Flam to try to repair the 
damage. And I remember the first time this

13:09.622 --> 13:16.652
happened, I walked into Fred Benson's office and 
he said, He said, Eubank, I've really just gotten

13:17.797 --> 13:21.562
an earful. That young man just told me that I had 
been running the college completely wrong here,

13:21.842 --> 13:31.755
and he gave me a lot of ideas how to get myself 
straight down and run this college a whole lot

13:21.842 --> 13:31.755
better.

13:37.702 --> 13:46.453
So anyway,

13:37.702 --> 13:46.453
we finally got Flamm to resign, because it got to 
the point where He was having major problems with,

13:47.362 --> 13:52.849
first of all, with all the students. The students 
didn't like him, and with the faculty. He

13:56.293 --> 14:02.921
basically just wasn't getting along with 
anybody, and it was partly because he liked to

13:56.293 --> 14:02.921
argue. And he considered that a way of life, and his 
wife was a professor over in the psychology

14:03.442 --> 14:15.597
department.

14:17.281 --> 14:23.610
And so anyway, and they argued all the time too, and 
it was just sort of their way of having fun. But it

14:25.292 --> 14:45.921
was not always appreciated here, and so Dan 
resigned finally, and I told him, and I didn't know

14:25.292 --> 14:45.921
that this was going to be processed, but I said, you 
ought to go work for somebody like Bell Labs and let

14:25.292 --> 14:45.921
them put you off in a corner where you can do 
research and don't have to interact with other

14:25.292 --> 14:45.921
people. Well, he went to work for Bell Labs. And 
now, Flam is a very famous person. Oh, is that

14:54.463 --> 14:54.864
right? Yeah. He later was really the first guy to 
invent... This is in making chips for computers,

15:02.613 --> 15:13.385
like electronic chips, semiconductors. And 
Dan... is really the father of what is called

15:15.010 --> 15:27.849
anisotropic

15:15.010 --> 15:27.849
etching, which is where you go in with 
anisotropic. It's A-N and then isotropic.

15:34.779 --> 15:36.481
Let me tell you what it means. It's where you go in 
and you want to etch out a square corner. If you just

15:42.635 --> 15:51.608
put in a chemical like hydrochloric acid, it'll 
etch, but it'll etch like in a sphere. It'll etch

15:51.628 --> 15:54.331
equally in sort of all directions. That's just 
natural. He developed the use of radio frequency

15:56.835 --> 16:11.916
plasma to shoot a plasma beam onto the device or 
onto the silicon or dope silicon and then it would

16:12.419 --> 16:14.602
make a square corner. So all the stuff you see on 
your computer chips are, you know, those things

16:14.702 --> 16:20.531
have all got these square corners. And so that 
etching was all developed at Bell Labs. And if you

16:25.398 --> 16:29.023
look at the original research papers, the first 
name was Phlam. And I was, because I'm involved in

16:31.467 --> 16:39.338
plasmas, I was at a meeting just a year and a half 
ago, International Plasma Chemistry meeting,

16:39.757 --> 16:52.769
And I talked to some of the people who were also on 
those papers who had worked with him, and they

16:39.757 --> 16:52.769
said, well, you know, it was difficult to work with 
him, but they had, and that had great success. And

16:53.690 --> 17:00.977
Dan is now a consultant, actually, to the chemical 
engineering department at Berkeley, at UC

16:53.690 --> 17:00.977
Berkeley. But I've also talked to some people out 
there, and they said, well, you know, he You have to

17:06.166 --> 17:13.617
keep him at arm's length, and we don't dare put him 
in the classroom, because he really is still

17:06.166 --> 17:13.617
pretty much, he has not mellowed. I thought he 
might mellow with years, like some of us, but

17:13.637 --> 17:19.085
apparently he hasn't mellowed too much.

17:21.990 --> 17:25.635
But anyway, he did something really wonderful. 
Some people don't care. They do. They do not. If he

17:30.122 --> 17:32.285
tried to stay here, it never would have worked. It 
would have never worked, though. Well, I better

17:34.330 --> 17:36.733
let you go. But one thing I might come back and ask 
you about later, Bill, is that you couldn't tell me

17:37.073 --> 17:44.602
there is a plan. Right. I'm probably going to go off 
over the more lasting, and I'm going to talk to Ray.

17:53.732 --> 17:55.133
This is something I didn't start. I mean, for sure. 
I started the... roll chapter of Omega Chi

18:00.233 --> 18:10.145
Epsilon, which was the National Chemical 
Engineering Honor Society in 1970 here at A&M.

18:10.165 --> 18:12.088
Again, I won't exactly say that I started it. At 
that time, I was the chief faculty advisor to Tau

18:12.228 --> 18:20.218
Beta Pi, which was the engineering honor society. 
But it takes into account everybody here in

18:20.478 --> 18:23.282
engineering. And some of the chemical 
engineering students in Tau Beta Pi came to me and

18:24.643 --> 18:29.970
said they wanted to form a separate honor just for 
chemical engineers. Because I could never get

18:33.772 --> 18:41.024
elected to office here in the Tall Bay to Pine, 
because they were always outvoted because they

18:33.772 --> 18:41.024
were more mechanical civil engineers. And so we 
formed the Roe chapter. And it later became the

18:45.110 --> 18:49.217
largest chapter in the country. And I was advisor 
until about six years ago. And then Ray Anthony

18:53.784 --> 18:56.869
took it for about four years. And when did that 
start? It started in 1970. And

19:00.874 --> 19:10.304
now Omega Chi Epsilon, the national honorary, has 
grown. We were about 18. We now have about 60

19:13.047 --> 19:19.094
chapters in Omega Chi. And as of the last year, I'm 
the national president of Omega Chi. And we are

19:25.857 --> 19:28.921
still growing at the rate of about five chapters a 
year. And we now have 20,000 total members, and

19:30.382 --> 19:35.368
we're initiating about 1,000. I just signed 1,000 
certificates over the Christmas holidays. So

19:40.414 --> 19:48.904
we're initiating about 1,000 people every year at 
about 20 campuses across the country. Is yours a

19:48.944 --> 19:51.908
one-year tenure for 96, 97? No, actually, it's a 
four-year tenure. stuck with it, I think, for

19:56.165 --> 20:10.502
about three more years, but it's a rather nice job 
being president because we have a

19:56.165 --> 20:10.502
secretary-treasurer who's at Kansas State who 
does all the work. I mean, as of the National

20:10.522 --> 20:22.335
Society, I mostly go to meetings and figure heads, 
so it's quite pleasant. But I wanted to bring that

20:22.356 --> 20:24.518
up because That's something that did start here. 
And

20:27.962 --> 20:39.856
I'm still trying to reactivate the Alpha chapter, 
because this was founded at the University of

20:27.962 --> 20:39.856
Illinois in the 1920s. And later, Illinois became 
inactive for the chapter.

20:47.264 --> 20:49.667
So I'm trying to get them back. But it's a real fine 
honorary.

20:58.737 --> 21:00.041
All right.
