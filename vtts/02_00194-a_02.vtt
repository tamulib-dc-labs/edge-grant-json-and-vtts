WEBVTT

00:03.524 --> 00:06.313
He was on the second floor of the YMCA building. And 
Rutter was in the Koch building,

00:14.678 --> 00:28.311
I guess, yeah, I guess through my senior year and 
then it was the next year that he moved up to the

00:14.678 --> 00:28.311
administration building because he became 
president of both the system and the college. As

00:28.931 --> 00:40.322
far as an undergraduate student in those days was 
concerned, who was the most active student

00:28.931 --> 00:40.322
administrator? Was it Dean Hannigan or was it the 
core commandant? I'd say as a student

00:45.526 --> 00:50.201
administrator, I would have listed Hannigan. The 
commandant was strictly business, core

00:50.562 --> 00:54.254
business. I don't think you would have gone there 
for a general purpose. I wouldn't have. Now, they

00:59.684 --> 01:08.637
had attack officers part of that time, and a man 
named Calvin Reese, class of 49, was one of those.

01:08.797 --> 01:20.755
He was also the drill team advisor, and he was 
absolutely my mentor and is why I graduated, and

01:08.797 --> 01:20.755
very close contact, you know, forever with him. 
Describe him, then. Well, he was a captain in the

01:23.378 --> 01:26.603
Air Force Reserve,

01:28.675 --> 01:39.597
had kind of a very soft family farm kind of look and 
attitude, soft spoken. not formal in military

01:39.880 --> 01:56.447
appearance, just extremely polite, extremely 
caring, but would listen and listen and listen and

01:39.880 --> 01:56.447
listen and let you come out with anything you 
wanted to come out with. And because of the Drill

01:57.529 --> 02:03.238
Team Connect, you know, I started going home for 
supper and Practically grew up with his young kids

02:03.218 --> 02:11.834
and just became a very major figure. Was totally 
influential in my finally having enough grade

02:13.196 --> 02:19.568
points to graduate. Did he give you some important 
advice? If so, summarize it. I can't verbally,

02:28.210 --> 02:49.915
nothing strikes me immediately, but what I got out 
of him was a soft mentoring relationship, role

02:28.210 --> 02:49.915
model of doing what's right, and no

02:28.210 --> 02:49.915
pretentiousness. at all. Were you aware of that 
impression then? I was then and have seen it better

02:53.564 --> 02:59.272
as time goes along. Right. That first year, how did 
you register for classes and what was your? You

03:06.463 --> 03:20.003
went through Sabisa Dining Hall and I think they, 
my memory is as a senior, I worked for housing or the

03:06.463 --> 03:20.003
Corps or somebody. And I was at one of the central 
tables where everybody had to go through, hand in

03:20.928 --> 03:27.516
something or collect something, I don't know 
what. And I'd just got my senior ring at the start of

03:27.536 --> 03:35.085
the fall of my senior year, first week in 
September. And of course, reversed, it meant that

03:35.105 --> 03:40.951
the star was on the inside where your little finger 
is. Well, I'd had it three days or something. I

03:44.536 --> 03:49.922
shook hands with every single person that came 
through there. At the end of the day, the star was

03:49.987 --> 03:57.540
embedded in my little finger, and it wasn't 
perfectly clear to me if it was going to ever come

03:49.987 --> 03:57.540
out. But, you know, you just lined up behind 
placards and saw some, you know, old guy named

03:59.984 --> 04:11.523
Monroe teaching history, and you wished that you 
could get in his class instead of Garland

03:59.984 --> 04:11.523
Bayless's class. But I wasn't so lucky. And I hope 
Garland hears this. What was your major? Do you

04:18.456 --> 04:19.518
remember that first year? I started pre-law, and 
then I went management, graduated management.

04:27.131 --> 04:29.476
Dan Lowe helped me graduate. Who were some of those 
first, in the first year, who were some of the

04:29.496 --> 04:35.486
instructors you can remember? Oh, I don't know 
about the first year. I think Garland was my

04:37.760 --> 04:40.043
history prof. There was a man named Clark who was 
biology.

04:53.880 --> 04:57.945
Were there some courses that quickly y'all were 
warned to stay clear of? Some tough. I wasn't

04:59.093 --> 05:00.154
warned enough.

05:03.759 --> 05:04.920
I got all those classes. And what did the routine 
seem like at A&M compared to what you had known at

05:06.142 --> 05:12.109
San Jacinto High School? It was busy, very busy. I 
wasn't a good student in high school. But I

05:19.390 --> 05:23.477
probably studied zero in high school. And so even 
at A&M you had to study some. I studied very little.

05:30.088 --> 05:37.821
I was excellent at procrastinating and thinking 
that I would do something and staying busy doing

05:30.088 --> 05:37.821
other things. Right, so you left school and then 
came back in the fall of 60, actually it was the

05:38.493 --> 05:44.984
spring of 63. 63. Made out a year and a half. Okay. 
And had, I don't remember how many, I had at least 15

05:49.031 --> 05:59.488
or 20 hours or something that I transferred from 
the University of Houston. And, you know, I hung

06:00.194 --> 06:04.922
around a sea from that point. As a result of being 
away for three semesters, was there any core

06:06.464 --> 06:14.457
identifier? Zero. Okay. I've heard of frogs being 
transfers. Well, but the key was I finished the

06:18.724 --> 06:21.368
entire freshman year. Okay. And so I wouldn't...

06:26.975 --> 06:33.626
Most people, there are a few people that know now, 
but most of the people in Class 65 assumed that I had

06:26.975 --> 06:33.626
been with them all the way. But a lot of guys in 64, 
while I was in school, knew that I had been with

06:34.668 --> 06:41.158
them. And it wasn't said very often, but I think I 
had a slightly different status. And then because

06:47.689 --> 06:50.974
of the relationship with Calvin Reese, At the 
start of that spring semester, they had lost one or

06:51.528 --> 06:57.777
two sophomore advisors to the drill team. And so I 
just became a sophomore advisor, one of three or

06:58.498 --> 07:03.105
four people. And then I was plugged back in again. 
And then lo and behold, the next year, I was the only

07:06.150 --> 07:13.581
junior advisor and then the only senior advisor. 
And you made the decision to identify with 65

07:13.821 --> 07:18.068
instead of 64. Yes. Well, it was sort of Reese's 
advice and the Commandant's advice. But I mean,

07:24.097 --> 07:30.665
you could have done the... Yeah, you could have 
probably gone back to F2, but you'd have been out of

07:24.097 --> 07:30.665
whack, I think. Like I learned to my pleasant 
surprise from Porter Garner, Jr., that he, in the

07:31.246 --> 07:44.422
class of 45, was one of those that left early. You 
remember they went on trimester and all. He never

07:46.845 --> 07:48.147
came back. and did not have quite enough hours to 
officially be a senior, but that because they were

07:49.291 --> 08:05.833
shipped out early, their entire group was given 
their senior rings, and that he never graduated. I

08:06.674 --> 08:08.076
had no problems. You know, I knew... I knew Frank 
Mueller, who was our student body president, was

08:13.203 --> 08:18.791
still very active, distinguished alumnus. I knew 
Ted Hopgood, who I hired as commandant to come back

08:19.112 --> 08:23.018
here. And

08:23.058 --> 08:31.290
there were just never any problems. I've been a 
co-class agent for Class of 65 for 10 years with

08:31.851 --> 08:37.399
Mueller and Bill Gimmons. And it's worked.

08:42.346 --> 08:46.391
For my personality and what I was doing, I think I 
had an advantage. What were the great advantages

08:47.952 --> 08:53.198
of being a senior in those days in the Corps?

08:56.622 --> 09:06.193
You had whatever freedom you needed or wanted as 
related to what you were doing with your personal

08:56.622 --> 09:06.193
time. You had the whatever ROTC or core functions 
things to do, but you basically had your own space

09:06.781 --> 09:16.836
in which to do that. It wasn't as common back then, 
but I wore my boots virtually every day, you know,

09:17.858 --> 09:34.543
that that was just something, you know, I was drill 
team, and so I think that, you know, I wore the

09:17.858 --> 09:34.543
uniform pretty well, and so that was something 
that I did most of the time. Where'd you get your

09:35.114 --> 09:37.778
boots, and how much did they cost? They were 
Horlicks boots, and I don't know where we got the

09:37.798 --> 09:45.230
$95, but we got the $95. Do you still have them? 
Still have them. Mother kept them, and so now I have

09:47.754 --> 09:50.519
them back. The Aggie ring was $32.50. And the myth 
existed then as it still exists that former

09:55.668 --> 10:01.857
students pays for half the rain. And as far as I 
know, it's untrue. But that's what people think.

10:08.245 --> 10:14.334
And you, like many of the rest of us, were not 
blessed with great family wealth. About how much

10:14.975 --> 10:19.120
extra spending money did you have in those student 
days? I went to school for $500 a semester. About

10:24.068 --> 10:28.297
$450 was room, board, tuition, books. So I had $50 
spending money. And then I was on contract, so I got

10:32.747 --> 10:36.496
$25 a month. And so that was all foo-foo money. I got 
$20 a month from my father in the divorce

10:40.758 --> 10:45.923
situation. And I didn't have a car. I didn't have 
any vehicles. So I was riding with people. And I

10:51.930 --> 10:56.154
don't remember. I was pinching pennies, but I 
don't remember having a problem. Where did you and

11:00.939 --> 11:04.083
your buddies go if you wanted to have a good time?

11:07.426 --> 11:09.128
You mean away? Well, most of the time we would go 
back home. We'd go to Houston. I had buddies that

11:13.697 --> 11:15.319
were in Houston. If you were going to stay here in 
the Brazos County area, where was a good Friday

11:17.321 --> 11:25.149
night or Saturday? You would just go to the show and 
go eat and tell stories. Where would you eat? There

11:33.578 --> 11:37.782
would be occasional beer busts on the Brazos 
River, but I I graduated from Texas A&M without

11:38.453 --> 11:44.178
having to drink beer, and it was okay that I didn't 
go to the beer bust. And so I usually did not go. Were

11:48.241 --> 11:50.143
people going to the clay pits when you were? That's 
basically the way I knew it. And as far as you know,

11:54.347 --> 11:56.749
where was that? I'd be danged if I know. I don't 
know. I'm not sure. Did you ever go to Uncle Ed's?

12:03.435 --> 12:03.595
No. Was it still going then? Hard Liquor's? I'm not 
sure those were still going. I think Ralph's Pizza

12:09.517 --> 12:12.962
Place was going. I didn't go to those places. 
Sparky's, was it there yet? I didn't drink beer, so

12:18.230 --> 12:19.612
I didn't go. And I didn't have the money to do 
anything extra, so I didn't go. In your outfit, as

12:26.783 --> 12:32.812
far as you knew, was there much alcohol in the 
dormitory? I have no significant recall of that.

12:37.803 --> 12:40.227
You couldn't say no, that there wasn't any. But if 
there was, it would have been probably hard liquor

12:40.487 --> 12:50.101
because refrigeration and all those issues. 
Everybody didn't have an icebox, a little

12:50.522 --> 12:54.327
refrigerator. Did you and your colleagues even 
know the terminology of drugs? I didn't. I don't

13:05.023 --> 13:05.704
think so. I don't think in the early 60s any of us Had 
heard of heroin and so forth. Not really. And so

13:12.927 --> 13:15.491
folks smoked cigarettes? Yeah, a lot of people 
smoked cigarettes. Cigars a little?

13:19.456 --> 13:21.058
Occasionally. I didn't smoke. Did anybody smoke a 
pipe? Occasionally. Yeah, I can remember a couple

13:25.124 --> 13:27.147
of guys that smoked a pipe. I had some juniors next 
to me when I was a fish that smoked a pipe, and it

13:27.607 --> 13:34.557
smelled good.

13:35.903 --> 13:40.830
In all of your undergraduate days, who were some of 
the memorable teachers, advisors? Well, I've

13:42.373 --> 13:48.823
already talked about Calvin Reese and James 
Hannigan. Denzel Baker was a good person. He was

13:53.049 --> 13:53.930
commandant. I knew Charlie Hornstein, who was a 
tech officer. I knew Bill Presnell.

14:03.933 --> 14:22.887
The Dan Lowe was the assistant dean of the College 
of Business and was like the typical style of the

14:03.933 --> 14:22.887
associate dean in those days in the 60s and to about 
mid 70s that there were very few rules written and

14:23.339 --> 14:35.216
they would cut you slack if they thought that you 
were deserving of it, and would work with you to get

14:23.339 --> 14:35.216
over whatever humps were there. I think they were 
very listening, very empathetic,

14:35.857 --> 14:47.815
stick to a rule if they thought it was right, but 
bend it a little bit if they thought that was right.

14:48.816 --> 14:51.220
And it didn't take a lot of pressure You know, that 
would happen, I think, with an individual student

14:51.605 --> 14:55.592
talking to them. You know, Mother didn't call, you 
know, in the 60s. There wasn't anybody ringing

15:01.002 --> 15:05.089
anybody's phone in the 60s. It was the student 
talking to the, and so you needed people that would

15:05.650 --> 15:10.980
listen to the student. Among my concern, I don't 
know. Beckham, John Beckham. Describe. People

15:16.015 --> 15:16.595
like that. Did you know John? I knew John. Describe 
him. A tall, professional-looking professor,

15:20.381 --> 15:29.615
very professorial, with that huge, booming 
voice. Incredible, deep, booming voice. Did the

15:33.140 --> 15:34.622
students give him a nickname? I don't remember. 
Because I've always thought it should have been

15:36.171 --> 15:38.795
Daddy Deep Throat. Yeah. I don't remember. Did you 
take a course from him? How did you get acquainted

15:42.021 --> 15:43.503
with him? Well, I know I knew him after I came back 
here in 68 very well. I don't recall for sure as a

15:50.615 --> 15:54.221
student. Because, see, I knew him at church and 
then. working registration, he was always one of

15:57.957 --> 16:24.943
the... Judge Stewart was a prof, taught law, you 
know, was reported to be an alcoholic or had

15:57.957 --> 16:24.943
alcoholic problems, but was also reported to be 
the quality of lawyer of Percy Forman, you know,

15:57.957 --> 16:24.943
who was a major, very major lawyer, national 
scope, you know, during that time period in the

15:57.957 --> 16:24.943
60s.

16:26.341 --> 16:30.967
And his classes were usually colorful and 
interesting, you know, very interesting. There

16:32.570 --> 16:35.934
was a guy named Satch Elkins who taught over there. 
George Rice, who was also very helpful to me in

16:37.076 --> 16:45.027
graduating, who taught management. So you 
changed business. Was that your major? From

16:49.033 --> 16:49.914
pre-law. From pre-law. Yeah, I'd stayed in 
business after. I think I only changed the once.

16:54.200 --> 16:54.340
Mm-hmm. Let's see, anybody in English you recall? 
Well, you remember

17:00.645 --> 17:07.093
the little quiet gentleman. Cofer? No, the little 
guy that lived to be pretty elderly, was around

17:08.715 --> 17:20.209
here well into his 80s, little bitty guy. Not Tommy 
Mayo. No. He was involved in Opus, very

17:23.421 --> 17:28.707
soft-spoken, white-headed.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.575
We'll think of his name when we edit it. It'll hit me 
in a minute. Well, it'll come back. What about

17:37.258 --> 17:37.999
math?

17:41.063 --> 17:42.905
No, I didn't have any good math profs. And you 
mentioned Garland. You had history. I think I had

17:45.508 --> 17:46.610
Garland for history. Garland. Goveron? I don't 
remember. No Blue Book Benton? No, I didn't have

17:52.450 --> 17:54.214
Blue Book Benton. I think the guy's name was 
Luther. He was in economics. I had ECO 311 with him.

18:03.213 --> 18:04.596
He was hard. I would say now I think he was fair, but 
he appeared to be very hard. So your major

18:11.202 --> 18:18.071
extracurricular activity was the drill team. As 
far as you were aware, what were the expected rules

18:19.233 --> 18:27.705
of classroom conduct and behavior at A&M? Go to 
class, be polite,

18:27.745 --> 18:34.574
take notes. Was the grading fair? No. I think it 
was. We were on the three-point system, which I

18:41.928 --> 18:58.643
think is pretty significant, because a 69 was an F. 
And I think an 83 was a C. So it would be different. I

18:59.444 --> 19:07.711
wouldn't have had my same level of grade point 
problems if a D had even given you one grade point.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.272
It wouldn't have been quite as tight. And so it 
wasn't hard to get an F. I didn't have the feeling

19:09.927 --> 19:18.662
that they did much curving. How did you and your 
buddies feel about those changes that came in the

19:20.044 --> 19:29.640
mid-60s regarding compulsory core, racial 
integration, co-education, and so forth? You

19:31.240 --> 19:35.964
know, on the surface, it was like, oh, gee, this is, 
you know, a new army. You know, you sort of would

19:36.164 --> 19:38.987
like for it to not happen. And I remember we, you 
know, I think we marched on General Rutter's house

19:40.047 --> 19:46.313
twice for both decisions. And, you know, it was 
after Chow and Duncan. And he came out on the front

19:49.135 --> 19:54.259
porch and said, thank you for your advice and go 
home. And everybody saluted and said, you know,

19:54.900 --> 19:56.841
yes, sir. And that was it. The riot was over. But I 
don't remember great animosity. It was certainly

20:03.868 --> 20:05.750
conversation. Neil Keltner was a corps commander 
and was somebody that I knew and bumped into

20:06.291 --> 20:12.079
occasionally. And he was going to Austin with 
Rutter regularly, you know, that legislative

20:12.640 --> 20:21.131
session in representing the issues. And so I knew 
that that was happening. Which of the changes

20:25.237 --> 20:29.082
caused the greatest concern? Was it the corps or 
women? Frankly, women was first, so I think I would

20:33.222 --> 20:37.627
say women. And then core, you're already, you 
know, you're right on the edge of the Vietnam

20:37.647 --> 20:45.517
business, getting ready to fire up pretty big. I 
don't think people realized the full impact of the

20:47.059 --> 20:55.849
decision right at that minute. Do you remember any 
event relating to the admission of black

21:01.454 --> 21:03.697
students? I don't. I remember seeing a couple of 
those first guys in the early 60s, but I don't

21:05.139 --> 21:12.709
remember it ever being an issue. I don't remember a 
single incident. I don't know of any. That was

21:16.455 --> 21:17.857
handled with great... I believe A&M did that as 
well as any school in the country. I'm unaware of it

21:21.061 --> 21:22.843
ever being an issue. Of course, there weren't very 
many of them. No, but still, it happened gradually

21:24.506 --> 21:29.132
and happened with great... Well, as it turns out, 
the Corps was essentially first in going female,

21:29.568 --> 21:35.456
too. You know, after that decision was made, they 
went female in 74. And only the last three years has

21:41.525 --> 21:47.213
VMI and the Citadel gone that way. And the military 
academies were after 74. So we were really first in

21:51.299 --> 21:53.642
that regard. It still struggled a long time, and 
there's always some bumps. But as far as saying,

21:58.205 --> 22:03.532
yeah, it's the right thing to do, that was done 
pretty quickly. And I've learned in these

22:03.672 --> 22:16.029
interviews that one of the things that Earl Rutter 
told Ford Albritton and John Lindsay on a trip to

22:03.672 --> 22:16.029
Chicago when they asked, well, what do we do if 
something happens to you, Earl? And he first said,

22:17.331 --> 22:21.837
well, I don't have anybody, and I've got to do that. 
That night they brought the subject back up. And he

22:24.513 --> 22:26.777
said, I've been thinking about it since you 
brought it up this afternoon. If something ever

22:26.837 --> 22:31.624
happened to me, you go to Tennessee and you get Jack 
Williams, first commissioner of higher

22:26.837 --> 22:31.624
education. And among the things he reminded him of 
is that he was at Clemson, a separate land-grant

22:32.045 --> 22:38.916
school in the South. When the changes were made. 
When the changes were made. And he went through

22:41.900 --> 22:49.011
that so he would be able to understand the culture 
here more clearly than most people would. Well,

22:49.312 --> 22:51.415
after graduation... I had two years of active 
duty. I was fortunate enough to be in Germany. I was

22:56.057 --> 22:56.758
in armor. And I was almost literally, I was one of 
the last 15 guys to go to Europe instead of Vietnam.

23:05.090 --> 23:09.016
And then you had almost no one, you know, go to 
Europe for a couple of years. And the good news of

23:10.358 --> 23:17.588
that was we had 10 officers when you're supposed to 
have 32 in an armor battalion. And as a second

23:18.209 --> 23:24.837
lieutenant, I was the only staff officer 
officially, the adjutant. And then as a first

23:25.818 --> 23:31.826
lieutenant, I was headquarters company 
commander, which was the hardest job because you

23:25.818 --> 23:31.826
had all the wild people. But had tremendous 
experience, but did decide to get out. And my

23:37.493 --> 23:40.316
mentor, Calvin Reese, was leaving. We were 
corresponding, writing. And he said, I think

23:43.560 --> 23:46.444
General Rudder will give you my job if you want it. 
And of course, when you change your mind and you're

23:46.778 --> 23:51.924
in Germany, a job sounds like a really good plan. So 
it's just like, yeah. So I wrote the letter. They

23:56.289 --> 24:00.414
said, you know, touch base as soon as you get back 
and there might be an opening. And I already knew

24:00.874 --> 24:04.198
Hannigan and I already knew Rutter. And they said, 
fine, you know, you're hired. You got to reach this

24:06.581 --> 24:08.744
job. I was leaving every year. you know, for four or 
five years. It was, I was on staff. The nature of the

24:18.463 --> 24:31.302
job that I had in the commandant's office, I was the 
yell leader, bonfire, fish drill team, Ross

24:18.463 --> 24:31.302
volunteer, all extra duty advisor. Colonel McCoy 
was the commandant. He didn't, He didn't like

24:36.256 --> 24:39.540
going to any university committee meetings. And I 
was somehow, at age 25, I was his senior university

24:40.721 --> 24:48.690
person over there. And so I was going to meetings I 
didn't have any business being at. But it proved to

24:52.834 --> 24:57.379
be extremely beneficial to me. And so I saw General 
Rutter pretty often. I saw Hannigan often. The

25:02.485 --> 25:04.407
associate deans I talked about. You know, the 
Beckhams and Potts and Ransdells and Lowe's and

25:05.011 --> 25:19.947
all those people were just, you know, I saw how good 
they were, and I was on the AOC and a lot of things.

25:20.748 --> 25:31.339
And Dan Lowe died young, but the very first year or 
so, he called me one day and said, I think he, the

25:32.197 --> 25:37.665
student was either with me or he was sending the 
student to see me. Or I was sending him to see him, I

25:38.786 --> 25:40.969
don't remember which. But anyway, we were talking 
and he said, I was telling him about this guy and

25:40.989 --> 25:49.201
it's like, you know, he needs a little help, you 
know, to graduate. And he said, well, I think I knew

25:50.643 --> 25:54.689
somebody else like that. Yes, I think you did. 
Well, are you telling me that you think this is the

26:00.614 --> 26:07.264
guy that I should do this for over anybody else?

26:10.529 --> 26:10.869
Yes, sir. I think I am. I think it'd be all right. 
Then you tell him to come see me and he will

26:14.775 --> 26:17.739
graduate.

26:20.463 --> 26:20.844
Okay.

26:23.668 --> 26:24.029
I will. All right. Back in those days, you're 
student days and your early days as a member of the

26:28.643 --> 26:38.996
professional staff, describe the activities of 
the MSC. What role did it play? I was never heavily

26:41.379 --> 26:44.323
connected to the MSC. I was heavily connected to 
all the core things. I knew who Stark was, but I

26:47.387 --> 26:52.394
never had any personal relationships with him. He 
mostly had under his wing the real bright stars.

26:57.280 --> 27:06.389
You know, the Corps Commander, student body 
president level people, people that could go to

26:57.280 --> 27:06.389
Harvard and Stanford and things like that, which 
we didn't have a big group. What was his pipeline to

27:07.730 --> 27:09.992
that connection? Former students. No, no, no, no, 
no. To get contact with those bright... Major

27:12.695 --> 27:16.799
student activities. You know, the major chiefs. 
Because I have the impression that he started

27:21.463 --> 27:27.169
identifying them first year they were here. And he 
got them... He may have. Kind of lined up and got

27:30.732 --> 27:32.155
them. Because it seemed to me that if you were... It 
had to be activities outside of the Corps. He

27:37.805 --> 27:41.171
wasn't going to identify you only because of Corps 
activities. You've had to show up somewhere else.

27:44.998 --> 27:48.785
With the possible exception of a Corps commander 
or somebody. He would still have known who those

27:48.865 --> 27:51.570
people were. It seemed to me that he would, in 
identifying, when he heard about a bright

27:52.006 --> 28:20.697
freshman, he would try to get that freshman to be 
the errand runner for the MSC council president or

27:52.006 --> 28:20.697
the SCONA chairman or the president of the student 
body and then that student would learn the ropes

27:52.006 --> 28:20.697
and they would work up and sometime later might 
have the same task. And all those processes, by

28:20.913 --> 28:25.307
today's standards, are very formalized. And the 
students do it with hundreds of students. Yes. Was

28:29.922 --> 28:34.095
the YMCA, was it active? in your day? Yeah. What 
went on there? Logan Weston and Gay, Gordon Gay.

28:40.507 --> 28:42.170
What did the, what happened at the one? Mostly the 
reason you knew them is they had steak fries, you

28:42.371 --> 28:47.662
know, at Hensel Park. And it was kind of a real thin 
kind of chicken fried steak like thing but they

28:52.773 --> 29:15.253
there's no telling how many thousands of steaks 
that they cook at various functions or outfit

28:52.773 --> 29:15.253
functions or whatever whatever you wanted there 
was somebody you could go talk to of course it had

28:52.773 --> 29:15.253
that little gym up there before it was renovated in 
79 and in the old days before the MSC it was the had

29:15.672 --> 29:23.522
the swimming pool and the bowling alley, and it 
really was the student center from it being built

29:15.672 --> 29:23.522
until the MSC was built. Now, Mr. Cashin had 
already died, hadn't he? I didn't know him. I don't

29:29.610 --> 29:30.832
remember him. The folks older than you and I I've 
chatted with remember him. H.L. Heaton was the

29:37.540 --> 29:39.683
registrar. Describe Mr. Heaton from your 
experiences. An interesting little man that

29:44.562 --> 30:01.878
seemed very business-like,

29:44.562 --> 30:01.878
in a hurry, lots to do, kind of fidgety, I think, but 
would do whatever he was polite.

30:05.701 --> 30:09.044
And when the general gave him an order, he followed 
it. Well, as far as I know, they all did that. Yes,

30:10.786 --> 30:13.388
but he particularly, I think, was... Like I know 
privately, he said in my presence more than once,

30:14.262 --> 30:21.933
over my dead body will we ever have black students 
here. Mr. Rudder told him to check the credentials

30:23.716 --> 30:35.013
of all of those first black active duty enlisted 
men that were coming here to finish their degree to

30:23.716 --> 30:35.013
be sure that they were in the right courses. He 
didn't want them to have to stand in line at Sabisa

30:35.914 --> 30:41.282
because there could be an incident there. for 
Heaton to get them in the right courses, then call

30:41.971 --> 30:50.380
each instructor and tell them that when they met 
their first class, those students were supposed

30:41.971 --> 30:50.380
to be there. Mr. Heaton. Yes, sir. And he did it. 
What was Guyon Hole? What role did it play? Well, it

31:00.831 --> 31:02.453
was a gorgeous old building. It was where you went 
to see old movies and the like. It was very

31:08.279 --> 31:10.341
dilapidated. When I came back was when they tore it 
down to start this facility over here. And the

31:16.441 --> 31:20.887
architects screwed up. They should have kept 
those columns. Yes, yes, yes. The front facade

31:25.212 --> 31:32.481
could have been, by today's standards, you would 
have saved it for sure.
