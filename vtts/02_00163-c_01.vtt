WEBVTT

00:04.081 --> 00:07.987
Those two I would consider guidebooks. For a book 
that I would identify as a narrative, that is, it's

00:08.628 --> 00:24.591
largely print with only a few illustrations,

00:08.628 --> 00:24.591
what are among the most successful and impressed 
books of that sort?

00:29.879 --> 00:32.383
I think the most successful ones are the most part 
are in our military history series okay and

00:33.123 --> 00:56.582
there's a good market and good demand for military 
history books and among those i think a dark and

00:33.123 --> 00:56.582
bloody ground by ed miller and doomed at the start 
by bill barch are two of the best sellers in

00:33.123 --> 00:56.582
military history And they probably sold around 
3,000 to 4,000 copies somewhere. Now what about

01:02.369 --> 01:08.478
the Centennial History of A&M and the updated, how 
did they do? The Pictorial History or the

01:10.240 --> 01:13.344
two-volume Centennial History? Well, both of 
them. How did the two of them do? Well, the

01:21.015 --> 01:23.498
Centennial History, I think, really sold very few 
copies. I think a lot of those were free copies to

01:25.646 --> 01:32.660
administration and alumni.

01:36.026 --> 01:38.171
The pictorial history did fairly well. I think the 
first edition, I believe, just off the top of my

01:38.191 --> 01:46.667
head, sold about 16,000 copies. And now we have the 
second edition, and I really don't know how it's

01:47.322 --> 01:50.587
done. I haven't checked those numbers in a long 
time. And the band book did well, didn't it? Well,

01:56.497 --> 02:02.807
it did well enough to justify its publication, 
although we were somewhat disappointed in that.

02:03.008 --> 02:14.106
We thought that every person who had ever been a 
member of the band and then a lot of the Corps people

02:03.008 --> 02:14.106
would want a copy of that book, but it didn't work 
out that way. Can you think of any that you or other

02:14.221 --> 02:24.598
members of the staff know, books that we might have 
done that got away that somebody else did that

02:14.221 --> 02:24.598
turned out to be? Oh, yeah, sure. I try to block 
those, though. No, but could you give them? If

02:30.748 --> 02:33.773
they're really good books, you know, I hate to see 
them go. But can you give an example of one that we

02:34.655 --> 02:39.823
might have done if we'd wanted to, but we I can't 
think of anything specifically right at the

02:40.934 --> 02:44.619
moment. I'll think for a second.

02:53.271 --> 02:54.833
I was thinking of the fish that got away. Yeah. 
Nothing that was really

03:02.433 --> 03:16.071
tremendous national literary interest that I 
would kick myself around the block if I lost, but

03:02.433 --> 03:16.071
there have been some books that I wish we had done 
that for one reason or another went to another

03:02.433 --> 03:16.071
press. I

03:16.091 --> 03:28.528
want to ask you some questions about being the 
editor now of a manuscript. A manuscript comes in

03:32.487 --> 03:37.824
And do you do any background preparation before 
you start editing that manuscript? Well... On the

03:40.071 --> 03:42.278
author or the topic? Well, um... It depends on what 
you mean by editing. At which stage? At the copy

03:52.207 --> 03:57.618
editing stage or acquisitions?

03:57.878 --> 03:59.221
Take me through the whole process. Okay, the first 
thing we get is a letter from the author suggesting

03:59.321 --> 04:08.620
that the author has this wonderful manuscript 
that he wants us to publish. And we ask for a full

04:09.983 --> 04:15.592
proposal with the description of the book and the 
sample chapters and so on. And we take a look at

04:15.652 --> 04:16.814
that. And if that looks like something that we 
could or should do, then we'll ask to see the

04:16.854 --> 04:24.806
manuscript at that stage. One of the problems with 
editing these days is that we're publishing so

04:26.068 --> 04:38.387
many books that it's almost impossible for the 
editor to read every one of the manuscripts that

04:26.068 --> 04:38.387
comes in. I'd love to if I had the time, but I just 
can't physically do it. So what we usually do is

04:44.688 --> 04:54.679
skim through as much of the manuscript as we can and 
see if it's well written. You can usually get a

04:55.100 --> 04:57.642
sense of the quality of the style.

05:00.365 --> 05:09.555
But we don't check technical details as to the 
author's research, the quality of the research at

05:00.365 --> 05:09.555
that point. If it looks feasible, we'll send it out 
for review to specialists. Do you normally get,

05:14.986 --> 05:23.219
for an author that's unknown to the press, do you 
normally get a chapter to look at first or the whole

05:14.986 --> 05:23.219
manuscript? We ask for samples first. If it's 
somebody we don't know, definitely we ask for a

05:27.786 --> 05:37.922
letter of proposal with sample chapters and an 
outline, a synopsis of the chapters. In general,

05:38.206 --> 05:49.377
about what percentage of those a chapter will lead 
you all to encourage them to later send the whole

05:38.206 --> 05:49.377
manuscript? One out of three? One out of three or 
four. Then you get the whole manuscript, send it

05:54.922 --> 05:59.426
out to how many readers? We have to have at least two 
readers. If both those readers' reports are

06:03.530 --> 06:06.373
positive, We don't need to go to a third reader. But 
if there's

06:08.694 --> 06:21.030
some controversy, conflict between the reader's 
reports, or if one of them is negative, then we may

06:08.694 --> 06:21.030
or may not go to a third reader. Is that standard 
industry-wide? Yes, it is. And then if the

06:26.998 --> 06:34.808
reader's reports are positive, then we'll 
present the manuscript with our recommendation

06:34.990 --> 06:40.061
and the reports and the author's response to the 
reports to the faculty committee. And it's their

06:40.702 --> 06:43.829
decision whether we should publish the book or 
not. But if we presented it to them right, if the

06:44.550 --> 06:53.910
reports are good, and if it obviously is a fit for 
our list, then they'll approve it generally. Can

06:54.194 --> 07:08.571
you think in your 25 years of experience here of any 
time when you all went contrary to the preliminary

06:54.194 --> 07:08.571
reader's report being negative and you all 
continued? Can you think of one that worked out

07:09.372 --> 07:11.795
well? Oh yes, we do that all the time. Is that right? 
Oh yeah. Many times you'll get a negative reader's

07:14.779 --> 07:22.648
report from one reader and you know that either 
that reader

07:25.632 --> 07:36.503
missed something in the manuscript, or over-read 
something, misconstrued information, or maybe

07:25.632 --> 07:36.503
even has a personal lax to grind. And so you go ahead 
and get the second report.

07:43.711 --> 07:54.722
Really, only I'd say 25% of the time, maybe even 
less, do I reject a manuscript on the basis of the

07:43.711 --> 07:54.722
first reader's report. I usually In most cases, 
I'll go ahead and get the second report before I'll

07:56.311 --> 08:01.418
send the manuscript back.

08:04.202 --> 08:12.053
Many times, when I do get a negative report 
initially like that, I'll go back and look at the

08:04.202 --> 08:12.053
manuscript myself. And if I disagree with the 
report especially, then I'll get a second report.

08:17.489 --> 08:21.615
Now you take then the reader's reports and your 
evaluation. And the author's responses to them.

08:23.678 --> 08:23.838
Right. You take that to the press committee. 
Right. And what is the official title we give to

08:26.903 --> 08:29.787
the? It's the Texas A&M University Press Faculty 
Advisory Committee. And how important is that

08:36.917 --> 08:38.820
group? Well, they are the group that decides on 
what is issued, what is published under the

08:39.101 --> 08:46.872
imprint of the press. So they are the editorial 
final deciders.

08:54.411 --> 09:08.868
It's their job to evaluate and debate the good and 
bad points brought out by the readers and to decide

08:54.411 --> 09:08.868
if we should publish the book or not. How important 
has that committee been in the years here?

09:15.877 --> 09:18.079
part of the press, really. We have a large 
committee compared to other university presses,

09:19.441 --> 09:36.499
but we've always had people on the committee who, 
for the most part, were very interested in what we

09:19.441 --> 09:36.499
were doing, very interested in publishing. And so 
they've always taking a strong interest in making

09:40.852 --> 09:44.015
good decisions. As you recall your 25 years here, 
who are some people on those committees that you

09:44.496 --> 09:51.683
would want to single out for appreciation?

09:54.546 --> 09:56.147
Well, you for one. You were the first chairman of 
the committee. Thank you. And

10:00.732 --> 10:10.622
some of the people on that, on the first committee, 
I didn't know very well because I wasn't working

10:00.732 --> 10:10.622
directly with them in that period, I know that

10:11.463 --> 10:23.425
I can't remember some of the people. I couldn't 
name all the people on the committee at that time.

10:28.695 --> 10:32.442
And perhaps you could, but I don't remember them 
all. I really didn't get involved with the

10:32.962 --> 10:40.051
committee until after you had gone on to El Paso. 
And Clint Phillips then became the chairman, and

10:40.131 --> 10:48.121
really worked more closely with the committee 
under Clint's term. And then more recently,

10:49.723 --> 10:53.047
Gentry Steele. All right, and Gentry's been the 
chairman about how long?

11:00.907 --> 11:04.050
Six, seven years, I think. I think it was about six 
years. And Clint were both deans of faculty.

11:10.216 --> 11:10.516
Right. Was there any reason why that was changed as 
far as you know? We had a change of the dean of

11:15.601 --> 11:25.631
faculty about the time that Tom Rotell started 
here. And I think that it was felt that it It would be

11:30.978 --> 11:38.367
easier for us to work with somebody who had already 
been on the committee and knew the operations on

11:30.978 --> 11:38.367
the committee. Because Bill Perry had not. And the 
new dean of faculty coming in, I think, was someone

11:40.670 --> 11:48.640
completely new, had never been on the committee or 
worked with him before. Bill Perry was a professor

11:48.861 --> 11:52.025
of math. Right. And Tom, it was set up that Tom and 
the press would report to Bill Perry. And so I think

12:02.505 --> 12:12.016
it was Bill's decision to put someone on as the 
committee chairman rather than himself. All

12:12.457 --> 12:23.129
right, as far as you know, the press in reality down 
through the years has reported to whom

12:12.457 --> 12:23.129
administratively? Well, initially it reported 
directly to the president. Frank Wardlaw went

12:26.553 --> 12:30.297
straight to Jack Williams. and then to Jarvis 
Miller, and then it was transferred to Frank

12:31.087 --> 12:43.123
Hubert, and then it went back to reporting 
directly to the President under Frank Vandiver.

12:43.804 --> 12:58.384
And then at some point, I think under Rick Studer in 
the early 90s,

12:43.804 --> 12:58.384
the President then... Bill Mobley? Mobley, Bill 
Mobley. decided to

13:00.787 --> 13:14.751
to transfer it to another office because he didn't 
have the time for the personal contact. And I think

13:14.771 --> 13:18.357
that on paper it was the provost, but in fact the 
dean of faculties. Well, it went to Dean Gage, and I

13:21.437 --> 13:27.703
think he was the provost. I know Rick worked 
directly with Dean for a while, and then I think

13:28.324 --> 13:43.960
that then perhaps when Mary Miller came in, it went 
on to the dean of faculty. As far as you at the

13:43.980 --> 13:46.723
working level were aware, Did the administration 
respond appropriately when the press needed a

13:47.277 --> 13:54.367
response?

13:57.551 --> 14:02.878
That is, did y'all ever, were y'all ever like, gee, 
we never get a response, we made a request? Did it

14:03.038 --> 14:10.028
seem that the- Well, yeah, I think there were some 
times when we would would prepare a report or a

14:11.932 --> 14:20.724
white paper or something and not hear from the 
administration. There was a scare during Rick's

14:21.885 --> 14:41.331
tour when we were in Austin for a Western 
University presses meeting, regional meeting of

14:21.885 --> 14:41.331
the association, and Rick got a message that he 
should get back to College Station immediately to

14:21.885 --> 14:41.331
justify the university's appropriation to the 
press. So there were times when we felt that we were

14:46.744 --> 14:53.599
not

14:53.782 --> 14:59.129
getting full attention or our message wasn't 
getting across to the administration. Alright,

14:59.149 --> 15:20.177
while we're on this side road about away from 
editing, were you at the working level aware ever

14:59.149 --> 15:20.177
of a regent or a politician or a former student ever 
trying to interfere in a press decision? Yes. Can

15:22.242 --> 15:23.904
you give any examples? There was a fellow from 
South Texas, I think he was an engineer, a retired

15:25.785 --> 15:50.468
Aggie, who had written some books and had 
contacted me and in fact had sent me a manuscript or

15:25.785 --> 15:50.468
two that I had reviewed.

15:53.587 --> 16:01.317
He had sent back to him and told him that it really 
wasn't the kind of manuscript we were looking for

15:53.587 --> 16:01.317
and the quality we were looking for. And although 
it was on a good topic, one of them was on the great

16:03.159 --> 16:08.006
wrenches of the American West. Tremendous topic, 
would have been an excellent book, but we felt that

16:08.546 --> 16:14.474
he just hadn't put it together well enough. And

16:16.176 --> 16:20.742
so... went for a few months and then we got a letter 
from the president's office saying who is this

16:22.544 --> 16:46.594
this fellow and why is he so upset that the 
university press hasn't published his book and

16:22.544 --> 16:46.594
they sent a copy of his letter and it was in effect 
what kind of idiots do you have working over there

16:22.544 --> 16:46.594
they they don't support the former students and we 
We support the university, and we don't get

16:48.110 --> 16:56.361
anything back, and they don't want to publish this 
good material by a former student. And we did get

16:57.883 --> 17:14.765
the president's support on that, and he stood by us 
and said, well, you know, the university press has

16:57.883 --> 17:14.765
to make these hard decisions, and they decided 
against your project, and I'm sorry, and that's

16:57.883 --> 17:14.765
that. But that wasn't that. this fellow wrote the 
president again and said, well, if that's the

17:17.118 --> 17:23.626
case, you're not getting any of my money. 
Apparently, he cut the university off because

17:25.348 --> 17:32.876
there must have been some money involved that he 
was planning to give the university. Were you, by

17:32.956 --> 17:39.104
chance, the editor of Clady Williams' father's 
book? No, I didn't work with that directly. But I

17:42.447 --> 17:44.490
was here, of course, when it was published. Do you 
remember all that story? A little bit. I knew sort

17:47.518 --> 17:50.083
of what was going on with that.

17:54.211 --> 17:56.655
We wanted to publish it. We knew it was important to 
the press that we publish it, and fortunately we

17:57.016 --> 18:05.552
were able to get Ernest Wallace to edit the book and 
get it into a shape that it was publishable, and it

18:06.207 --> 18:12.918
turned out to be a very good book. It was a good deal. 
Frank Wardlow, I think, deserves a good deal of

18:15.643 --> 18:22.454
that credit, doesn't he, for being able to work 
that alone? Yeah, I think Lloyd Lyman was mainly

18:22.474 --> 18:29.245
the person who is directly involved in 
negotiating that. All right, back to the work of

18:34.642 --> 18:39.228
editing a manuscript. Then you get the manuscript 
now ready for you to edit it. You mean after the

18:46.416 --> 18:48.799
committee's approved it for publication? Yes, 
yes. Well, generally, if the author has responded

18:49.920 --> 18:59.772
to the readers' reports and made any revisions 
that the readers suggest, anything that comes up

19:00.663 --> 19:21.473
in the discussion of the committee and anything 
that we see as editors that we see needs to be done to

19:00.663 --> 19:21.473
it if the author does all that then we'll go ahead 
with it at that point so there's really no more

19:00.663 --> 19:21.473
editing that we do at that point and we turn it over 
to copy editing And then let the copy editors worry

19:21.993 --> 19:25.637
about polishing it up. All right. Describe then 
what I, let's see, what phrase should I use for this

19:26.197 --> 19:33.705
first editing? Just editing? Well, it's 
developmental editing. It's, like I say, not much

19:40.192 --> 19:44.856
editing involved, really. It's just working with 
the authors and the readers and getting the author

19:44.937 --> 19:50.262
to make revisions that the readers recommend from 
their

19:51.203 --> 20:02.891
point of view as specialists in the field and 
knowledgeable people. Right, and the editor at

20:02.951 --> 20:07.322
that point does not read other books on the same 
topic to see if this person, this manuscript,

20:08.956 --> 20:16.663
makes sense or anything? That is, does this 
manuscript stand on its own feet? Is that right?

20:20.927 --> 20:24.590
Yeah, generally the readers are familiar with the 
literature in that particular. Oh, no, no, I was

20:24.610 --> 20:27.372
meaning you as the. Oh, the editor? No. Okay. No, 
not necessarily. It's generally in one of the

20:34.338 --> 20:38.322
topic areas that we cover in our acquisitions.

20:42.766 --> 20:55.839
I cover military history and natural history and 
Eastern European studies and

20:42.766 --> 20:55.839
environmental books and natural history books. 
And Mary Lynn covers Texas history, Western

20:55.859 --> 21:08.072
history, political science and presidential 
studies and Mexican-American studies and so on.

21:08.710 --> 21:11.595
So we divide up the chores that way. But we don't go 
out and try to educate ourselves in military

21:12.757 --> 21:22.092
history other than just the normal reading that 
we've done over the years. All right. Now, at

21:22.874 --> 21:30.306
first, you did that early reading of that early 
manuscript. Then you also did the copy editing.

21:35.778 --> 21:38.741
When I first came to work here, I only did copy 
editing. Oh, all right, okay. Right, but then you

21:40.282 --> 21:41.863
move on up. Yeah, for a while there, I was doing 
everything. All right, now the copy editor. Mary

21:47.549 --> 21:49.150
Lynn was, too. And the copy editor, what does the 
copy editor look for? Everything? Yeah,

21:57.197 --> 22:05.785
you look for everything from punctuation 
mistakes to the style of presentation and whether

22:06.727 --> 22:21.744
the book is going to be the language of the book, the 
style of the book is going to be understandable to

22:06.727 --> 22:21.744
the market at which it's aimed.

22:24.567 --> 22:36.480
Copy editing is an important job, and I'll always 
respect the people who do it, because it takes a

22:24.567 --> 22:36.480
special person to be able to focus on them. on a book 
like that. And the copy editor doesn't have to be a

22:39.267 --> 22:46.177
specialist in the field that he or she is working 
with. I edited many manuscripts in my time that I

22:47.719 --> 22:57.172
had no idea what they were talking about, 
technically. I mean, a book in

22:58.113 --> 23:06.585
French foreign policy, for example, I knew who de 
Gaulle was, and that was about it. But I could get

23:10.971 --> 23:21.562
into the book, and if the author said something 
that didn't make sense, I at least knew to query it

23:10.971 --> 23:21.562
and ask the author, do you really mean this? It's 
misleading to me, a layperson. Will it be clear to

23:26.147 --> 23:27.888
other readers? And I think that's the most 
important thing a copy editor can add to a book is to

23:34.865 --> 23:38.149
be able to recognize where other readers might 
stumble. And you used a blue pencil until about

23:39.251 --> 23:41.554
when? About 87, 88. Well, no, it was actually later 
than that. We started using computers here about

23:48.042 --> 23:51.707
87. Before that, of course, we used them in the 
business office, but then the editorial and

23:53.529 --> 24:04.804
marketing offices and design and production, we 
began using computers in the late 80s. And then we

24:05.527 --> 24:20.406
really began starting to get

24:05.527 --> 24:20.406
manuscripts on disk in the early 90s, say seven or 
eight years ago. And of course now practically

24:21.207 --> 24:26.013
every manuscript we get is on disk. Are there still 
some that come in? in the old-fashioned way. Very,

24:29.649 --> 24:30.571
very rarely. And usually you can spot those in the 
proposal material that they send. If it's still

24:35.457 --> 24:47.553
typewritten, it's someone who either has an old 
manuscript that they've dragged out of the closet

24:35.457 --> 24:47.553
or someone who doesn't know how to use a computer. 
And in a case like that, you wonder if they are

24:48.634 --> 24:55.463
up-to-date enough to to have a manuscript that's 
worthwhile. There are some people who are.

25:04.436 --> 25:05.418
What's his name? Skutch, the ornithologist and 
natural history man.

25:15.032 --> 25:16.454
I can't think of his first name. S-K-U-T-C-H, 
Skutch? Right, Skutch. He lives in Costa Rica, and

25:22.021 --> 25:29.549
he's very elderly, but he keeps putting out 
wonderful books on bird life. And we published two

25:30.029 --> 25:43.563
of his books, The Minds of Birds, and Trogon's 
Falcons, and another

25:30.029 --> 25:43.563
bird. And he still types everything out on a 
typewriter. He lives in Costa Rica, way back in the

25:48.868 --> 25:51.471
forest. And he pounds it out on typewriter. Now, 
for him, he's published books with many different

25:54.342 --> 26:03.153
publishers, and we feel honored and fortunate 
when we get one of his manuscripts. So for him,

26:03.173 --> 26:06.597
we're willing to have it transcribed to a 
computer. As you look back over these 25 years, can

26:07.559 --> 26:21.677
you remember one or more that from start to finish, 
it was a joy to work with, where that one kind of

26:07.559 --> 26:21.677
stood out? What would be some of your favorites? 
I'll tell you one that has always stood out in my

26:24.212 --> 26:30.681
mind is Lighthouses of Texas. This is one of the 
paintings, one of the illustrations from that

26:31.302 --> 26:35.468
book. And that book just clicked into place from 
start to finish. I was at the Oklahoma Historical

26:44.120 --> 26:49.808
Society meeting at their centennial meeting in 
Guthrie, Oklahoma. And I was so happy to be there,

26:53.828 --> 26:56.612
because that was my home state. And it was the 
centennial meeting, 100th year after the big land

26:56.812 --> 27:02.760
rush. And one of the speakers there was T. Lindsey 
Baker, who I'd known for years, Texas historian.

27:11.172 --> 27:13.195
He was speaking to them. And he and I got together, 
and we decided to go have a drink one of the old

27:20.365 --> 27:27.473
restored saloons in Guthrie, downtown Guthrie. 
And we picked up Jim Steeley along the way. Jim

27:31.238 --> 27:33.981
Steeley's with the Texas Historical Commission. 
I'd known Jim for years, too. And we went to the

27:37.645 --> 27:45.114
saloon, and we're sitting around talking, and I 
asked Lindsey what he was working on. And he said,

27:45.134 --> 27:50.220
well, I've been doing research on the lighthouses 
of Texas. And I said, well, that's really

27:51.500 --> 28:02.136
interesting because I've always wanted to 
publish a book on the lighthouses of Texas. We

28:02.236 --> 28:04.639
ought to discuss this more. And Jim Steele pipes up 
and he says, well, it really is interesting

28:06.562 --> 28:21.304
because the Texas Historical Commission has 
grant money from the National Park Service to

28:06.562 --> 28:21.304
publish a book on Texas lighthouses. So right 
there at the table, we all three came up with the

28:22.330 --> 28:28.720
project. Lindsey would write the text, and I would 
help him put it together and get the

28:28.740 --> 28:40.879
illustrations, and Jim would provide the 
funding. And I came back to the office and was

28:47.727 --> 29:00.686
walking through the halls and I saw Harold 
Phoenix's painting, it's in the Wardlaw

28:47.727 --> 29:00.686
collection here, his painting of an oil derrick. I 
think it's hanging in the director's office right

29:01.287 --> 29:04.732
now. And I thought, you know, that has exactly the 
proportions of a lighthouse, the derrick

29:04.752 --> 29:12.744
standing up there in the middle of an open field. 
And so I called Harold and asked him if he would be

29:16.027 --> 29:18.990
interested in doing these lighthouses. And he was 
delighted. And he traveled to every site on the

29:20.932 --> 29:28.759
Texas coast, whether the lighthouse was still 
standing there or not. He was there in person, even

29:29.400 --> 29:37.708
took the boat ride out to the old Sabine Pass 
lighthouse site. And then he went through old

29:38.008 --> 29:42.793
photographs did a lot of research before he did 
these paintings, and they were a wonderful

29:43.145 --> 29:51.134
addition to the book, beautiful things. Now, how 
many of the originals did we end up with in the

29:51.534 --> 29:54.838
press? Just this one. And what did he do, sell the 
others? He sold the others, yes. Well, actually,

30:03.027 --> 30:08.933
what happened was the Rockport Maritime Museum 
wanted to host an autographing. And so the opening

30:13.000 --> 30:16.746
for the book was there in Rockport at the museum. 
And then they purchased all of the original

30:17.447 --> 30:25.761
paintings except this one. And so they wanted this 
one, and he said, well, I've already promised it to

30:25.781 --> 30:33.874
the press for the Wardlaw collection. and so they 
they commissioned him to paint a replacement for

30:34.748 --> 30:57.567
it which is the same lighthouse just uh you know 
it's a little bit different and so he said well

30:34.748 --> 30:57.567
while he was doing that he just painted a whole new 
series and sold those for his for himself a trivia

30:34.748 --> 30:57.567
from my mandel rogers Is he still doing Texas art? 
Yes, he's still working in Sweetwater, still

30:59.971 --> 31:03.257
painting. Because there used to be a place in 
downtown Lubbock upstairs of what I'd call a big

31:11.182 --> 31:34.135
office supply place and when you were opening up 
and say you're opening up a new office they've got

31:11.182 --> 31:34.135
all the chairs and the tables and the desk 
everything but also they had art and we used to stop

31:11.182 --> 31:34.135
and some of his art would be there but the last few 
times we haven't seen it there but he's still

31:11.182 --> 31:34.135
active uh the last i heard he was i talked to someone 
From Sweetwater, it's been less than a year ago. So

31:39.205 --> 31:41.487
you'll be back out there. All right, back to 
manuscripts. Can you think of a manuscript or so,

31:43.629 --> 32:00.506
the wording, the written manuscript, that was 
marvelous for its quality and lacked little need

31:43.629 --> 32:00.506
of editing? Are there any you recall that were? oh, 
I remember one, and that's one of those that got

32:05.620 --> 32:10.433
away, too.
