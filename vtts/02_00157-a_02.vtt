WEBVTT

00:03.018 --> 00:06.363
Army guys, of course, still had some khakis left 
over. But, you know, it was cheap, whatever it was.

00:12.592 --> 00:14.915
And did you all get regular haircuts? Oh, yeah. 
Yeah, you didn't see any long hairs. What did you

00:19.041 --> 00:26.412
all come to assume were the unwritten but clearly 
understood rules for classroom behavior?

00:29.716 --> 00:30.257
I think... that certainly were unwritten, but I 
think they were a carryover from where you came

00:31.452 --> 00:41.146
from school, you know, your high school. And in 
those days, there weren't any rowdy classes. I

00:46.915 --> 00:52.083
think the veterans were there by and large to get an 
education. They weren't there to make any kind of

00:52.103 --> 00:54.106
post. I do think that the veterans probably had a 
quieting influence on anybody who wanted to be

01:01.304 --> 01:04.268
writing. I don't think we ever had any discipline 
problems in class. I never remember one. Do you

01:10.055 --> 01:14.761
remember some pranks or jokes that ever occurred 
in any class? Not in class, no. There were always

01:18.346 --> 01:20.088
stuff, you know, off campus. I mean, you know, out 
of class. But I don't, we were a pretty serious

01:22.571 --> 01:24.834
group. I don't remember any. What about some 
faculty members that you came to respect highly

01:29.013 --> 01:35.742
during all of your years there? During all my 
years? All your student years.

01:41.349 --> 01:47.296
I have good recollections of more of my 
junior-senior years. Not so much the business

01:47.417 --> 01:49.900
faculty. I would say they were, by and large, 
mediocre. But the liberal arts faculty, I

01:56.232 --> 02:05.506
remember a feeling that I was really learning 
something there. I liked English. I had some good

02:08.270 --> 02:09.752
English professors. I can't remember names right 
now. Who was the head of the English department?

02:15.501 --> 02:18.145
Gosh, I can't remember. Was it Cofer? No. D.B. 
Cofer?

02:24.177 --> 02:25.479
I can't remember. But I do have a distinct feeling 
that I got a good liberal arts education. Those

02:32.651 --> 02:37.899
guys, the liberal arts people, for some reason I 
had the feeling that they had been there. They had

02:37.939 --> 02:42.206
some tenure, more so than the business school. Do 
you remember some nicknames for some faculty

02:42.246 --> 02:46.092
members? No. There were some, but I just can't 
remember. Let's see, what about some student

02:52.510 --> 02:59.759
pranks in the dormitory or anywhere else that you 
knew about? About the only thing, people get

03:00.700 --> 03:06.387
drowned out occasionally, which I've already 
explained. Not much more than that, and there

03:08.730 --> 03:13.176
wasn't a whole lot of that. Occasionally guys come 
in drunk and raise a ruckus, but I expect less of

03:13.216 --> 03:22.467
that than a lot of other places. Where did you and 
your buddies that first year or so go on a Saturday

03:22.767 --> 03:27.433
night for a good time? Well, first of all, we were 
constrained by lack of money. But not having cars,

03:33.442 --> 03:35.865
we couldn't leave. We couldn't leave Bryan 
College Station. We would go to the movies. We

03:41.933 --> 03:44.256
would go out and drink some beer. Of course, those 
who were older could do that without a problem.

03:47.922 --> 03:49.023
Where did you go to drive? Oh, there was a little... 
beer joint halfway between Bryan and College

03:52.180 --> 03:59.829
Station, kind of at the Y down there, and we'd go 
down there and drink beer. There really wasn't a

03:59.890 --> 04:01.311
whole lot to do. Movies, and that's it. Did you go to 
Uncle Ed's? Hard Liquors? I went out to Hard

04:06.458 --> 04:08.540
Liquors, yeah. Describe it, as far as you 
remember. I really don't have much recollection

04:12.004 --> 04:13.907
of it. How many people could it seat?

04:18.673 --> 04:19.193
Oh, gosh. Was it a Maybe 40 or 50. Was it a wild, noisy 
place? No, just good times, but not wild and noisy.

04:27.394 --> 04:28.936
I don't remember it being wild and noisy. And did 
they attempt to not serve beer to underage people?

04:36.928 --> 04:41.936
Well, since we were of age, I never paid much 
attention to them not serving. I don't ever

04:41.956 --> 04:43.838
remember anybody being refused. Did people get 
drunk? Oh yeah, yeah, people got drunk, but I never

04:48.172 --> 04:52.900
got real bad. I do remember there was a, he was a 
fellow who had been on the team of, championship

04:53.781 --> 05:14.095
team of 39, and he was one of these guys who, he was 
apparently a great football player, but he could

04:53.781 --> 05:14.095
never get away from college, and he'd come back and 
he lived out there, and he was a drunk, and we used to

04:53.781 --> 05:14.095
feel so sorry for him. Did you, that first year or 
so, did you ever go to the clay pits? Don't know

05:20.231 --> 05:22.193
where they are. Okay. That's an area, I don't know 
in what era, but it was west, south of the campus,

05:22.333 --> 05:35.246
across the railroad in somebody's pasture, and it 
was an old pit where they had dug some clay for

05:22.333 --> 05:35.246
building purposes. And there was sleazy water in 
there, and apparently that's where they'd go,

05:35.907 --> 05:44.335
eight or ten guys, drink beer, maybe go skinny 
dipping, No, I don't know about that. In those

05:48.674 --> 05:54.262
years, all of your student years, were you ever 
aware of a bootlegger in Brazos County? I heard of

05:54.282 --> 05:56.044
him, but I didn't know about him. If anybody wanted 
liquor, he drove across the river. Did you all call

06:00.009 --> 06:01.191
it Whiskey Bridge? I don't think we called it. I 
know that name, but I don't think we had it. It was

06:05.757 --> 06:06.678
just over the river. Did any of the veterans bring 
alcohol back into the dormitory? Not much. There

06:13.106 --> 06:13.647
was some. but not much. And not hard liquor, 
really, that I remember.

06:21.059 --> 06:23.921
Occasionally some beer, but there really wasn't 
much of that. What were the, while we're on this

06:23.941 --> 06:29.886
point, what were the other, what were people 
smoking? There were a lot of pipe smoking,

06:29.987 --> 06:33.009
cigarette smoking, not much cigars. But a lot of 
people did smoke. Probably, you know, a lot more

06:36.052 --> 06:38.574
than they do now, I'm sure. Churned tobacco? The 
rodeo team did, yeah. I remember one time the rodeo

06:43.951 --> 06:48.859
guys all lived in one dormitory. I want to call it 
Pazell, but I don't know whether it was or not. It

06:51.323 --> 06:53.186
was right by Sabisa Hall. And they all lived in that 
same dormitory. And most of them did. And one time a

06:56.952 --> 07:01.079
guy had a rope that he wanted to stretch. And so he 
had a car. And he tied the rope around the bumper of

07:03.483 --> 07:10.735
the car and the other side to a tree and then took it 
up tight, you know, to stretch the rope. And the

07:11.204 --> 07:18.054
campus policemen at that time, the campus cops 
were not the caliber they are now. They were

07:18.074 --> 07:21.299
really, I don't know where they got them. But they 
ticketed this guy for having bad brakes because

07:21.319 --> 07:27.968
they thought he had tied his car up to keep him from 
rolling down the street. That was the mentality of

07:27.988 --> 07:31.994
the campus cops at that time. But the rodeo guys, 
they were a tough group. They were a lot of fun. But

07:36.501 --> 07:40.907
they dressed just the way rodeo guys always have 
dressed, I guess. The MSC didn't exist. Oh, Guy and

07:46.005 --> 07:46.866
Hall. There were movies there, too. Casual movies 
in Guy and Hall, yeah. That's where I first saw it.

07:51.693 --> 07:52.534
We've never been late.

07:55.438 --> 07:59.864
But I don't remember going to Guy and Hall a whole 
lot. And maybe one of the reasons is, of course, I

07:59.884 --> 08:04.390
worked at WTOL, and then I went to work on the 
battalion. I mean, working in the battalion, you

08:04.831 --> 08:09.477
just didn't have any time at all to go off to movies 
and do that. Alright, now why did you get involved

08:09.642 --> 08:14.048
with the battalion? You weren't going to be a 
journalist were you? No, I had no ambitions to be a

08:15.891 --> 08:17.533
journalist. I'm not sure how I got involved. I know 
I paid a little bit more. I think I was making like

08:23.901 --> 08:28.828
maybe 50 cents an hour at the radio station. Maybe I 
got 60 or 65 at the battalion. And for a while I

08:32.393 --> 08:34.015
worked at both places. I didn't get paid in the 
battalion the first time. But then The battalion

08:38.448 --> 08:43.274
offered to pay me, and so I quit the radio station 
and went on the battalion. And you were not getting

08:43.514 --> 08:47.178
any journalism course credit for either one? Oh, 
no, no. But that, I have said this before, that is

08:48.780 --> 08:56.970
probably the best experience I had with working on 
the battalion. Explain. The director of student

08:58.532 --> 09:03.598
publications, a man by the name of Roland Bing. 
Bing? Bing, B-I-N-G. He was an interesting man. He

09:07.777 --> 09:09.579
was, at that time, he was a bachelor. He worked, he 
had, he was slightly crippled, and he lived in

09:10.219 --> 09:35.944
YMCA, and he had been, he was an Aggie, and he had 
been in World War II, and because he was somewhat

09:10.219 --> 09:35.944
crippled, he had limited duty, and he ended up 
coaching a black football team at Randolph Field,

09:10.219 --> 09:35.944
which apparently, and he got all the good black 
football players And his team beat everybody. And

09:40.124 --> 09:43.469
he did not need to go into the Army. He went in. He had 
to fight his way to get in. Well, he came out and went

09:46.674 --> 09:48.978
to A&M. And he was in charge of student 
publication. And he ran that operation as well as

09:52.724 --> 09:57.872
anybody, I think, ever could. And he made it a 
challenge to us to put out a paper without mistakes

09:57.912 --> 10:02.860
in it. What did you all think the function of the 
battalion was? We were very independent. What was

10:08.979 --> 10:10.100
its importance? It's important. We were the 
newspaper, and we prided ourselves on being very

10:11.102 --> 10:15.929
independent. And we were. They never checked our 
editorials, our news stories. But Bing, we always

10:23.099 --> 10:33.454
called him Bing,

10:23.099 --> 10:33.454
conveyed to us the responsibility that we had of 
running our own newspaper. And he would say, as

10:33.738 --> 10:38.484
long as you do it responsibly, you don't need to 
worry about anything. Do it right. And we honored

10:39.545 --> 10:43.070
that. Did y'all print stories that were positive 
as often as you did negative? Yeah, we tried to be

10:47.796 --> 10:52.562
very, we won several college newspaper awards 
while we were there. And while we were, one of the

10:52.582 --> 11:01.433
things that we kicked off, I don't know whether 
they do it now, but we sponsored the Southwest

10:52.582 --> 11:01.433
Conference Sportsmanship Award. That was a first 
for the battalion. But we did win a number of

11:05.518 --> 11:07.120
awards. But he would put, Bing would take the paper 
and put it up on the bulletin board and circle in red

11:09.203 --> 11:24.403
any grammatical error that we made or where we were 
editorializing in something that should have

11:09.203 --> 11:24.403
been a news story or where it was obviously 
slanting the news. He would point it out. And our

11:25.565 --> 11:30.151
goal was to put up a paper that Bing couldn't put a 
red mark on. Where was the Where were the offices?

11:32.429 --> 11:33.150
Goodwin Hall. Goodwin Hall. And the press was in 
the basement of Goodwin Hall. So it was actually

11:36.834 --> 11:37.995
printed there? It was printed there, and we set our 
own, we didn't set our own type, we set our own

11:38.035 --> 11:48.426
headlines, and we made up the paper down there on 
our own. There were some really good fellows that

11:48.446 --> 11:52.630
worked down in the press, but we put the paper to 
bed. How many issues per week? Five a week. So just

11:56.194 --> 11:57.315
the weekdays? Weekdays only. Weekdays only. And 
it was morning or afternoon? Let's see. I should

12:05.906 --> 12:08.870
have that. It was afternoon, because it took us the 
whole evening to run the press roll. I think it came

12:15.298 --> 12:19.043
out in the afternoon, early, mid-afternoon. And 
did you say a while ago you don't remember how you

12:19.724 --> 12:22.989
exactly got involved? No, I really don't. I think 
it was maybe somebody on W-Talk. Also worked in the

12:27.290 --> 12:33.138
paper and said, hey, they need somebody over here 
who can do this, you know, and I went over and worked

12:27.290 --> 12:33.138
both places. But all student publications worked 
out of it. What were some important stories that

12:39.166 --> 12:41.650
you remember? Oh, gosh. I got in trouble with the 
administration one time, and I don't know, I guess

12:45.155 --> 12:53.346
it was when I was a junior, maybe. And for some 
reason or other, they cut the Christmas vacations

12:56.568 --> 13:01.714
You didn't get off on a Christmas vacation until 
like the 22nd or 23rd. You just had a few days. And my

13:03.396 --> 13:08.082
brother, who came the day after I did, he was 
married. He was an architect, and he could draw.

13:10.124 --> 13:13.829
And I got him to draw a cartoon, which we put on the 
front page. And it showed this Aggie standing

13:14.450 --> 13:20.257
knee-deep in the snow with his bag. And Santa Claus 
saying, you should have been home for Christmas by

13:20.837 --> 13:25.663
now. And he says, I couldn't. I go to A&M and they 
wouldn't let me out. And Dr. Harrington called me

13:29.388 --> 13:34.694
into his office and read me the riot act. But they 
were wrong. And I didn't worry about that. They

13:37.417 --> 13:39.439
never said anything about it. But it really upset 
the administration. Was it during that time when

13:43.143 --> 13:49.449
the Corps marched on Dr. Gilchrist? No, that was 
before. That was 46 or 47. I thought so. No, this was

13:54.094 --> 13:55.195
later. What were some other big issues that you 
all... Oh, well, I told you how I got in trouble

13:55.647 --> 14:03.655
editorializing against Midnight Yale practice. 
That was a mistake. And it was a signed editorial.

14:07.398 --> 14:10.561
Oh yeah, they knew who wrote the editorials. I 
don't remember any big stories. Of course, a big

14:13.764 --> 14:22.853
story was whenever the guys from the University of 
Texas came over and tried to firebomb the bonfire.

14:23.187 --> 14:29.033
which at that time was built on the parade ground 
outside of, I don't know what they call it now, but

14:23.187 --> 14:29.033
it was outside Goodwin Hall. The drill field. 
Drill field, okay. It's now Simpson Drill Field.

14:31.295 --> 14:33.157
Simpson, okay. Let's talk about Bonfire. Do you 
remember Bonfire your freshman year? Since it was

14:38.162 --> 14:40.003
in you, you didn't see it. Did you veterans get 
involved at all? Not as much as the Corps did, but it

14:42.666 --> 14:49.613
wasn't as big an organized thing then as it has been 
in recent years. What was the Bonfire made of? It

14:53.073 --> 14:55.936
wasn't big logs like they do now. It was more 
whatever they could gather up. It was pretty big,

14:58.879 --> 15:00.881
but I mean, compared to other schools. Where did 
they gather it? Down, you know, off campus. But I

15:05.586 --> 15:06.307
don't remember. And how did they procure that? I 
don't have any. I'm sure it was illegal. I don't

15:11.312 --> 15:12.013
remember. See, on the battalion, I didn't have 
time to do that. We just would comment on it. We

15:15.937 --> 15:16.878
didn't have to work on it. And what was the pinnacle 
of Bonfire? Oh, it was a night house. And it was

15:21.355 --> 15:24.938
supposedly, was it painted orange in your day? I 
don't remember it being painted. I'm sure it had

15:27.060 --> 15:32.145
marks from UT on it, but I don't specifically 
remember. Do you remember in any of your years did

15:32.185 --> 15:35.549
you help gather up any of the material? No, because 
I was working on it. All right, now describe this

15:38.952 --> 15:41.474
bombing. Well, the stack had been pretty well 
built, and battalion officers were up on the

15:41.494 --> 15:50.303
second floor of Goodman Hall overlooking the 
drill field. And It was just a day or two before, and

15:51.055 --> 15:55.300
we heard this airplane. Daytime? It was daytime. 
Oh, yeah. I heard this airplane, and it came over,

15:57.362 --> 16:00.705
and it came real low. And they were dropping things 
out, which turned out to be some kind of bottle-top

16:01.466 --> 16:05.651
cocktail. I don't know whether they were on fire. 
They had to have been on fire, I guess. Well, they

16:08.414 --> 16:11.157
thought they could set the thing off, and that was 
what they couldn't have. But we were all very

16:11.557 --> 16:20.927
frustrated, shaking fists in the air, because the 
airplane might have, as I remember, more than one

16:11.557 --> 16:20.927
pass over trying to drop things on it. And I mean, 
Pete, we were furious, you know, because we felt so

16:21.245 --> 16:25.891
impotent. And nobody got out a gun? No, no, nobody 
did anything like that. Was it a biplane? No, it was

16:33.041 --> 16:35.985
a single-wing plane. And the story we got was that, 
you know, you knew where it came from. So somebody

16:41.473 --> 16:47.421
in the administration called over to Austin and 
alerted the police over there, and they picked the

16:41.473 --> 16:47.421
guys up when they landed. I don't know what 
happened, but... But it was a big excitement. We

16:52.795 --> 16:54.757
didn't have many things happening. Who were the 
key administrative leaders of A&M during your

16:54.777 --> 17:00.285
undergraduate days? The one that I remember, of 
course, Dr. Harrington, Dean Penberthy. Spike

17:08.416 --> 17:15.785
White, he was the student activities athlete, all 
that sort of intramural sports type thing. Can you

17:16.486 --> 17:18.589
describe them in personality? Dr. Harrington? 
Yeah, he was... I have to be careful here to think of

17:22.963 --> 17:32.997
Dr. Harrington's name as I knew him later, but he 
was well respected. Chemistry faculty member?

17:35.601 --> 17:36.903
Yes, he was chemistry.

17:39.967 --> 17:47.698
And I think there was a feeling of respect for him 
and the office at that time. I presume that still

17:48.202 --> 17:50.385
exists. But he was, by that time, he's the 
president. I think he was, he may have been dean of

17:52.528 --> 17:55.332
arts and sciences. I didn't go that high up in the 
hierarchy at that time. But he was the one that, in

18:00.740 --> 18:08.691
my mind, stands out because he's the one that read 
the right act to me when I put that cartoon in the

18:00.740 --> 18:08.691
paper. And then Penberthy. Penberthy was 
director of, dean of management at that time, it

18:09.692 --> 18:17.483
was just Dean Penberthy.

18:18.138 --> 18:21.662
It wasn't a particularly forceful kind of fella. 
But did you respect him? I think we tolerated him.

18:27.669 --> 18:31.273
The veterans didn't pay much attention to him, to 
tell the truth. I think he felt the veterans were

18:31.293 --> 18:43.167
more than he could handle because they respected 
him, but if they wanted to do something, they

18:31.293 --> 18:43.167
didn't. A&M changed because they didn't have the 
control over the student body like they'd had

18:43.535 --> 18:48.622
before. And of course, then the commandant of 
cadets, he was a big factor. When I first got there,

18:56.692 --> 19:01.038
I think it was Joe Davis was the commandant. And Joe 
was a good fellow. But the administration didn't

19:03.321 --> 19:09.248
give him much slack. The better one, the best one, 
in my recollection, was Hayden Bogart. Describe

19:12.998 --> 19:13.879
him. Oh, he was a tiger. He'd been a Marine enlisted 
man in World War I. He was then, of course, went to

19:20.645 --> 19:22.767
West Point. He was tough. He ran, and my experience 
with him is when I, after I got into the Corps, he

19:25.570 --> 19:34.798
would not tolerate shoddiness in any respect. 
There'd been a good bit of hazing going on. He tried

19:37.881 --> 19:40.844
to put a lead on it, and it was fairly successful. He 
just wouldn't tolerate it. He was introduced to

19:42.817 --> 19:48.526
the honor code, which was well respected. He was 
tough as nails and swore like a Marine. The guys

19:55.657 --> 20:00.885
were kind of afraid of him, but he wanted them to be. 
But he was a good man. He was a good friend.

20:08.137 --> 20:11.001
He didn't kowtow to the administration like 
former Commandants had. Former Commandants were

20:14.090 --> 20:22.360
not, they were employees of the state, whereas the 
Boatner was active duty Army members. And that

20:22.380 --> 20:23.802
changed the relationship. And so he pretty well 
ran the Corps. Later, were you and your buddies

20:29.449 --> 20:39.661
surprised when he took over that Korean prisoner 
of war camp where there had been a riot and

20:29.449 --> 20:39.661
everything? I don't think we were surprised. but 
we felt that he was probably the best man for the

20:41.828 --> 20:44.732
job. A sidebar to that, I was, after I graduated, I 
went into the second division in Korea, and had

20:46.235 --> 20:59.615
been there about, oh, almost a year, and I was due to 
rotate home. I may have told you this story. I was

21:01.878 --> 21:02.959
due to rotate home. Unbeknownst to me, General 
Boatner, Colonel Boatner had been promoted to

21:04.101 --> 21:10.030
Brigadier General, and I was in Japan on R&R, And he 
got assigned to 2nd Division Command, Assistant

21:10.600 --> 21:13.864
Division Commander. So I went back to Korea from 
R&R. I didn't know he was there. And I arrived in my

21:18.490 --> 21:23.076
battalion, back of the truck, two day broke the 
beard, covered with dust. And I jumped out of the

21:24.037 --> 21:31.647
back and the battalion commander came up and he 
said, there's some general in our division who

21:24.037 --> 21:31.647
wants to see you right now. He said, take my jeep and 
get down to him. Went to the other battalion

21:34.770 --> 21:38.335
commander and gave the jeep to the lieutenant that 
he's living in. So I went down and I didn't I was

21:39.322 --> 21:44.168
trying to think what I'd done in Japan that would 
merit, you know, what I felt was coming. And I got

21:44.808 --> 21:49.494
down there and got a hold of his aide. And I told him 
who I was. And I said, the assistant division

21:51.436 --> 21:54.840
commander has asked to see me. And he said, yes, he 
wants to see you. I said, well, boy, I'm in trouble.

22:00.086 --> 22:05.672
So I went down and he was living in a truck, you know, 
with a bed on the back of it. And who comes out of the

22:06.774 --> 22:07.995
general boat? And he looked at me and I'm standing 
there and I have this dust all over me and I'm not

22:08.887 --> 22:12.311
shaved. And he tore me up one side and down the 
other. What kind of specter are you? What do you

22:19.359 --> 22:22.683
mean coming in and reporting to me looking like 
you've come out of a ditch? I mean, for about five

22:22.723 --> 22:24.405
minutes. Then he laughed. He said, come in and have 
a drink. So we went in and had a drink with him and he

22:28.389 --> 22:34.917
said, I've been given the job of having division 
history written. And he said, He knew me from the

22:37.777 --> 22:39.358
battalion. He said, I think that's something you 
could do. And I didn't want to do it because I was due

22:42.802 --> 22:45.344
to go home. And I scuffled around a little bit and he 
sensed that I was reluctant. And he said, go back

22:52.350 --> 22:54.472
and think about it and give me a call tomorrow. So I 
went back to the battalion. I got to the battalion

22:56.274 --> 22:57.936
and my bags were packed. I had already been 
transferred. And so I went back down and he laughed

22:59.937 --> 23:04.982
and he said, Now, this was about July or August of 
1951. And he said, you get this done, I'll see you

23:09.459 --> 23:12.724
get home for Christmas. So he gave me a driver, and 
just carte blanche to do it. And I ended up with a

23:18.151 --> 23:21.556
couple artists and photographers and what have 
you. And I drove all around the division, and I

23:21.576 --> 23:24.100
wrote that history. And so I carried it back. He 
never asked to see it. I carried it in, and I gave him

23:28.446 --> 23:30.830
the whole manuscript. And he said, okay. He said, 
they'll come back in about three days. I'm back

23:33.903 --> 23:34.744
three days. He said, okay. He said, now I want you to 
get published. And he gave me the name of a colonel

23:37.667 --> 23:41.370
going to the Far East Command. He said, you go over 
there and tell them Hayden Boatner said to put you

23:41.391 --> 23:45.955
together with somebody that can publish this book 
in Japan. So my entourage, we got over to Japan, put

23:47.016 --> 23:53.302
something with VIP quarters and gave us a staff 
car. I went in to see this colonel. And I said,

23:55.485 --> 23:58.227
Hayden Boatner said for me to tell you this. And so 
he said, be accustomed. He said, okay. And he put us

24:02.118 --> 24:06.805
with the Fari printing company that printed the 
Fari's edition of Newsweek magazine. And they had

24:07.285 --> 24:08.708
English line types. So they put the thing 
together, and we went in 10 o'clock in the morning,

24:09.449 --> 24:16.619
proofread until mid-afternoon, went out and went 
back. And we just lived our life a ride, you know,

24:16.799 --> 24:21.226
for about five, six weeks. And they put the thing 
on. I called on the phone, and by this time it was the

24:22.027 --> 24:26.934
middle of December. I called Boatner on the phone, 
and I said, we've got the first production, the

24:26.954 --> 24:31.180
first books off the line. And by this time, I had a 
captain working for me. Well, I was first

24:33.175 --> 24:36.078
lieutenant, but the captain worked for me. The 
captain ended up, he was living with some Japanese

24:36.098 --> 24:39.102
girl. But he said, you tell Captain, whatever his 
name was, he said, you tell him to stay there and

24:39.562 --> 24:48.673
make the arrangements to ship these books to the 
addresses that we're going to give him. And he

24:49.594 --> 24:51.697
said, you go over and see Colonel so-and-so. Far 
East Command said you're to get home by Christmas.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.943
In four hours, I was on an airplane. And then the 
follow-up to that is, I went to Fort Knox. And I did

25:00.640 --> 25:02.162
make it home for Christmas. I went to Fort Knox, 
finished armored school, and at that time he'd

25:02.182 --> 25:07.129
been sent to coaching. And he called me and wanted 
me to be his aide at coaching. But I'd already just

25:10.393 --> 25:14.238
taken another job as an aide to another officer at 
another job. So I couldn't do it. It was a big

25:16.121 --> 25:18.644
decision, because I really kind of wanted to go. 
But the guy I was aide to was the commander general

25:19.305 --> 25:24.993
of all the armored corps, and I figured I'd better 
stay with him. But anyway, we were good friends. I

25:26.575 --> 25:29.078
used to see him when he lived here, and then to a day 
he died. Let's see, back on campus. I got away from

25:35.314 --> 25:44.167
it a while ago, and if you have an answer to this, 
typist, put it back in chronological, go back in

25:35.314 --> 25:44.167
the right time. People smoked tobacco, and they 
drank some beer, and a little bit of strong

25:45.349 --> 25:52.760
alcohol. Yeah, but not much. What other, did y'all 
even know any other... Drugs existed? Absolutely

26:01.367 --> 26:02.788
not. I don't think there was a tea school full of 
drugs on the campus outside of the medics. It was

26:08.695 --> 26:10.137
just not there. And in that first year or so, where 
did you and your buddies get dates?

26:17.205 --> 26:19.228
I made a couple trips up to TSCW. There's something 
else now, I don't know what it is, but up there. TWU.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.216
TWU, okay. Mainly through there, I think. Because 
those girls would come down, you know. They'd

26:30.986 --> 26:33.349
empty out a dormitory and put the girls in there. 
Did you have any of those dates? Oh, yeah. Describe

26:37.475 --> 26:38.918
the routine. How would the girls get down there? 
I'm trying to think. Was it on the bus or the train?

26:44.766 --> 26:45.668
No, it wasn't the train. It must have been the bus or 
maybe cars. I don't remember how they got there. We

26:49.574 --> 26:52.238
didn't have a transportation. Many of us did. And I 
didn't. But... I don't remember how they got

26:56.403 --> 27:00.429
there, but anyway, most of them stayed in 
dormitories. They'd clear out a whole dormitory.

27:02.612 --> 27:04.114
You'd just have to go and move somewhere else. And, 
oh, it was a great time. How were those young women

27:08.260 --> 27:09.922
treated? Oh, marvelous. You know, because there 
were still relatively few of them on campus, even

27:12.165 --> 27:15.790
when they'd come in from the dances. And they'd 
bring their friends, too. Oh, they got the royal

27:20.357 --> 27:22.660
treatment. It's not like today where you take it 
for granted. Now, I've heard about Some routines

27:25.883 --> 27:34.151
in the dormitory of a moose pod or beast bucket 
where there would be a kind of a game. Who got stuck

27:34.531 --> 27:35.992
with the worst date? No, I don't remember that. All 
dates were good. There weren't any bad ones. And

27:40.897 --> 27:43.639
where were the dances held? Sabisa. Oh, yeah. 
Sabisa got all decorated up. They had a band. The

27:48.564 --> 27:50.946
Aggieland Orchestra would come in and play. What 
did you all think about the Aggieland Orchestra?

27:52.567 --> 27:53.608
Oh, we loved them. They were good. They played our 
kind of music. I keep thinking that ought to be

27:56.495 --> 27:58.979
recreated. They don't have it now? No. That would 
be a splendid thing. What was his name, Turner?

28:04.367 --> 28:04.647
Yeah. Bill Turner. I think it was. Oh, it was a very 
credible dance thing. Yeah, and they played

28:10.015 --> 28:12.599
concerts across the state, I've learned.

28:16.485 --> 28:18.929
Do you remember taking any dates to football 
games? No, I don't. I must have, but I don't

28:20.651 --> 28:24.477
remember. And you veterans didn't get involved 
with Reveley? Oh, you get up in the morning, you

28:31.508 --> 28:33.430
ain't got Reveley? Or the dog? Or the dog, either 
one. No, we didn't get involved. Of course, if

28:35.893 --> 28:41.038
Reveley came around, he got same treatment on our 
side of the fences. Is that right? Oh, yeah. Let's

28:44.361 --> 28:47.164
see, did you go to any basketball games? Yes, I know 
I did. And they were in... DeWare? DeWare, yeah.

28:53.290 --> 28:53.991
Describe them. noisy, hot, and we didn't win many. 
What did you and your buddies think about Yell

28:58.817 --> 29:01.160
Leaders? Oh, we liked them, yeah. They had 
civilian, non-reg Yell Leaders also, and they

29:04.785 --> 29:14.639
were a very closely knit group, and everybody 
liked them. We elected them, as I remember. And

29:16.542 --> 29:18.865
football and basketball games, did you veterans 
mix in with the core? Yeah, there wasn't any

29:21.729 --> 29:24.952
distinction.

29:28.476 --> 29:33.020
Were you all aware of any special courses or any 
kind of gimmicks for athletes? No. They took the

29:35.642 --> 29:36.583
same courses? They took the same courses, had the 
same props, everything. I don't even know that

29:39.886 --> 29:43.710
they got any kind of special counseling. They 
didn't make it. The married veterans, describe

29:47.077 --> 29:54.368
what you remember about where they were living and 
the routine for them. Okay. Well, their routine on

29:55.129 --> 30:00.517
campus was basically, you know, like the other 
non-regs. And their wives worked all over campus.

30:03.622 --> 30:13.236
I don't think the school could have gotten by 
without all those wives because the school had

30:03.622 --> 30:13.236
grown so rapidly and there were so many jobs to be 
done and those young girls, you know, they'd this

30:13.486 --> 30:15.108
field in every position you can think of. They 
lived, some of them lived in town, but most of them,

30:15.548 --> 30:28.283
I think, lived in the old converted army barracks 
that were over there, I don't know how to, off Texas

30:15.548 --> 30:28.283
Avenue, down from where the Ramada is, back in 
there. And they were abysmal buildings. All

30:31.827 --> 30:35.712
right, now, weren't there also some down near the 
south end of Kyle Field? There were some houses,

30:37.354 --> 30:39.596
but those were, I think, were the project houses. 
Oh, so they were that, all right. And were there

30:40.570 --> 30:45.537
some veterans housing also near the Northgate 
area, stuck in there? Not that I remember. Married

30:49.443 --> 30:51.066
veterans, not that I remember. I think it was all 
kind of down from the Ramada back in there. College

30:55.192 --> 30:55.472
Butte. Yeah, the College Butte. There were a lot of 
them. And it was great to go over there and get a home

30:58.617 --> 31:01.221
cooked meal once in a while. We had friends.

31:04.926 --> 31:08.772
Was there a veterans extracurricular 
organization? If there was, I don't remember, but

31:10.675 --> 31:16.382
they were pretty active.
