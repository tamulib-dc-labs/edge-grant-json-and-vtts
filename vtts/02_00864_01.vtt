Ruth Mendoza-Ordones, O-R-D-O-N-E-S.

00:09.314 --> 00:23.640
Ruth grew up in the John Boniva mines, and that's 
essentially what we'll be talking about this

00:09.314 --> 00:23.640
afternoon. Okay. What year were you born, Ruth? 
And the mines, and Gnevers Mines. And Gnevers

00:30.882 --> 00:33.707
Mines, and that was 1927? Right. Okay. Would you 
tell me the story of how you were born? Well, it's a

00:41.500 --> 00:43.122
big story.

00:46.348 --> 00:47.529
It's a horror story. I passed in the kind of days my 
mother and my daddy. And... I'm not going to school

00:55.668 --> 01:14.539
because my dad and my mother, he don't have no money 
to send me to school.

01:14.559 --> 01:16.483
Okay. Yeah, you were going to tell us a story about 
the chickens and the lady that helped your mother.

01:21.082 --> 01:26.950
Oh, one of my mother, he started playing with me, 
and at the time he told me I'm too cheap. And I put

01:28.652 --> 01:31.115
attention to my mother what he told me. Too cheap. 
Uh-huh. And he said, well, daughter, I tell you

01:33.959 --> 01:43.571
this because I don't have no money to pay the doctor 
to bring you. And I pay a lady to bring you for two

01:44.192 --> 01:47.376
chickens. So you were a cheap child, only costing 
two chickens.

01:56.502 --> 01:57.122
Right. Were you ever sick as a child out in the 
mines? No. You were a pretty healthy child. Yes. If

02:04.370 --> 02:10.697

time you left the mine area? Do you remember how old

02:10.717 --> 02:14.882
you were?

02:16.128 --> 02:16.549
22. About 22. So you lived at the mine site after it 
was closed down? Yes, right. I see. Do you remember

02:23.739 --> 02:28.486

living there? No. They didn't? No, he never paid

02:29.247 --> 02:31.270
anything. Okay, even while he was working in the 
mine? Right. I see. He had a lot of help from Mr.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.679
Ginniver. He had a lot of help? Mr. Ginniver gave 
your father a lot of help. Right, because my

02:41.585 --> 02:44.489
daddy's a boss man in the mines. I see. Would you 
like to answer the phone?

02:55.300 --> 02:58.588
If your father was a boss man and he worked on top of 
the mines, or did he go inside the mines? Inside the

03:01.578 --> 03:02.820
mines. I see. So he supervised the actual digging 
out of the lignite. Yes, sir. I see. As a child, did

03:08.687 --> 03:12.111

yes, about two times. I see. Did you like going down

the house. It's an awful house. Was it one room or

from the line of houses? Well, about ten feet.

05:29.338 --> 05:30.039
About ten feet? I see. And you were telling me the 
other day when we were walking over the mine site

05:33.443 --> 05:37.568
that you had to walk. to get your water? Yes. I had to 
get my water to the tanks. And that place had no

05:44.136 --> 05:46.539
water. Was that rainwater? Yes, it's the 
rainwater. So they didn't bring water? No, sir.

05:51.924 --> 05:54.087
Well, what would happen when it hadn't rained in a 
while? Was there ever water? Yes, everybody come

05:57.550 --> 05:59.953
to town and get the water. Come to town, I see. And 
get the water. In barrels? Yes, in barrels. And did

06:05.459 --> 06:07.282
Mr. Coniver pay for that? No, sir. You have to do it 
your own self. I see. And do you remember how much it

06:12.028 --> 06:15.513
cost to get a barrel of water? A nickel. A nickel a 
barrel. Okay. Okay, when your father Joe got up in

06:20.300 --> 06:26.048
the morning, would he have breakfast before he 
went to the mine? Yes, sir. He'd take a lunch. And he

06:27.991 --> 06:29.072
took a lunch with him. What usually did he eat for 
breakfast, and then what did he eat for lunch?

06:32.729 --> 06:35.934
Well, sometimes my mother, well, he don't have 
nothing to put in. Well, he put some business, and

06:35.954 --> 06:42.344
he put the lunch, too, because he don't have no 
more. I see. Well, when you did have food, what kind

06:43.806 --> 06:47.051
of food were you eating? Well, I mean, some 
potatoes, and sometimes with my mother, he had

06:47.632 --> 06:53.020
some chickens. Chickens? Yes. I see. And then you 
would have a dinner in the evening when you came

06:57.046 --> 07:01.611
home? Yes, three times a day. Now, did your father, 
when he came out of the mines at night, he must have

07:03.733 --> 07:09.019
been pretty dirty. Yes, sir. Did he clean up at the 
house, or did he clean up somewhere else? Yeah,

07:14.225 --> 07:18.449
well, before he came to the house, he cleaned by 
himself from the mines. I see. So they had bathing

07:19.470 --> 07:22.454
facilities there? Yes, sir. Okay. What about you 
and your sisters and mothers? Did you have a

07:25.482 --> 07:27.546
bathtub or anything like that? No, sir. Just a big 
towel. Everybody use it. A big shower? Yes, sir.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.177
Was there only one for the mine? Yes, sir. Right. I 
know you were kind of small, but maybe your parents

07:38.782 --> 07:42.428
told you this. How many miners and their families 
were there at the mine? The largest number at one

07:48.697 --> 07:52.483
time, would you say?

07:58.387 --> 07:59.188
You have no idea? Mm-mm. Do you know about how many 
houses there were?

08:09.320 --> 08:10.802
Oh, about 22 houses. About 22 houses. Yes, close to 
us. So that would mean at least 22 families. Right.

08:19.392 --> 08:22.856
OK. Now, were there any bachelors at the Boniva 
mines? Yes, sir. Did they live in the two-room

08:24.017 --> 08:25.980
houses? Yes, sir. They did? live in groups yes sir 
casino had no place to live i see they didn't have a

08:28.525 --> 08:52.710
boarding house right no sir do you remember about 
when the mines shut down you know for good no sir

08:28.525 --> 08:52.710
what what did your father joe do when the mines shut 
down did he become a farmer or No, sir. He come

08:53.640 --> 08:58.866
straight to town and find a job, and the job he find 
it to cut some wood. Cutting wood. Uh-huh. For a lot

09:00.268 --> 09:01.229
of people. And he finish that kind of job, and he 
started to find a job to picking cotton for the

09:02.171 --> 09:10.801
family. I see. It's one kind of job he do before the 
mines close. Before the mines or after the mines?

09:18.030 --> 09:18.591
After the mines. I see. So you went out and picked 
cotton? Yes. As a family. Right. Shopping and big

09:23.796 --> 09:25.519
time. Now that was only during, you know, August 
and September, wasn't it? Yes. And what did y'all

09:31.190 --> 09:37.242
do the rest of the months of the year when there 
wasn't any cotton to be picked? Well, my daddy, he

09:37.262 --> 09:42.171
started back to cotton woods for white people. 
And, of course, his daughters really couldn't do

09:42.573 --> 09:45.396
anything else. No, sir. My big sister, well, 
sometimes he worked for the white people to clean

09:46.878 --> 09:55.048
the house, and he pay a dollar a day. I see. Would she 
walk to town to do that? Yes, sir. I see. You didn't

09:59.793 --> 10:01.916
have any mules or carts or anything? No, sir. We 
didn't have anything. Did some of the other

10:03.898 --> 10:05.921
families have it? Yes, sir. I see. Now, I've heard 
that some of the miners were able to save money and

10:07.462 --> 10:12.208
have cars. Or did that happen at the Bonita Mines? 
Augustine told me that he was a taxi driver. Yes. He

10:18.942 --> 10:21.065
started to have a car. He saved some money, $2 or $3. 
It is nice enough. And he buy a new car. And well, he

10:27.072 --> 10:32.438
charged the other Spanish people to take it 
somewhere else. And he charged $0.98 to bring it to

10:32.598 --> 10:36.403
town. $0.98. I see. He told me a quarter. Must be 
inflation back then.

10:47.435 --> 10:50.179
Were you friendly with the other families in the 
mining camp? Yes. Did you have parties together?

10:52.321 --> 10:57.147
No, because he didn't have the money to support 
that kind of parties. He never had nothing,

10:57.908 --> 11:03.615
especially not my family, because it's a big 
family. Right, a big family without any brothers.

11:06.519 --> 11:06.759
Right. That must have. It's been a hardship 
because the brothers could have gone out and cut

11:08.112 --> 11:12.597
wood with the farmers. Yes, that's right. I see. 
What about the celebrations for Cinco de Mayo and

11:16.782 --> 11:21.808
Diaz Ciete? Well, my daddy is the one who 
celebrates for all the Spanish people. He

11:26.273 --> 11:30.498
celebrates about four times, and he can't support 
no more. I see. And that's why the reason he stopped

11:31.379 --> 11:34.603
to do that kind of job. I see. Do you remember any 
trips that you ever made to town, to Rock Bay? About

11:42.189 --> 11:43.110
three or four. That's all? Mm-hmm. I see. Now you 
said you lived in the mines or in the mining camp

11:46.953 --> 11:53.220
until you were 22. What happened when you were 22? 
Well, I started myself to work and I started to

11:55.542 --> 12:04.731
learn a little bit what I needed myself. And I 
worked for too many people. Doing what kind of

12:08.905 --> 12:10.007
jobs? Well, I started to clean the houses. And I 
worked for too many years in that kind of job. And I

12:18.839 --> 12:22.504
started back to work in a cafe, wash dishes. And 
that, when I started in a new job, is in a nursing

12:24.447 --> 12:29.093
home. In a nursing home? Yes, sir. About how old 
were you when you started in a nursing home? 28

12:36.773 --> 12:38.075
years. And I worked four years in a restaurant. And 
did you live at the rest home where you worked? No,

12:48.727 --> 12:49.508
sir. Did you live in town? I lived in town. Was it a 
boarding house? Yes, sir. My daddy, he paid some

12:55.075 --> 12:57.798
rent over there. And he continued to chop wood all 
this time? Yes, sir. Do you do any other kind of odd

13:02.052 --> 13:04.796
jobs? No, it's all the job he do because that's all 
the job over here right there

13:04.816 --> 13:22.643
Did your father was your father and mother were 
they born here in the United States or no my mother

13:04.816 --> 13:22.643
and my daddy he's from Mexico He brought in

13:32.275 --> 13:35.619
Did he come over during the revolution? Yes, sir. 
So it would have been after 1910 and probably

13:36.921 --> 13:42.488
before 1920? Yes, sir. Somewhere in there? Yes, 
sir. My daddy, he can talk English. My mother's the

13:48.996 --> 13:49.937
same. He can talk English. Do you know where they 
learned English? Well, my daddy's the one he

13:54.402 --> 13:56.945
learned a little bit. My mother, he can't. And he 
never learns anything. Did your parents leave any

14:03.798 --> 14:09.625
relatives in Mexico? No, sir. They didn't have 
just the two of them? Yes, my daddy and my mother.

14:13.950 --> 14:15.953
Did they ever talk to you about old Mexico? Well, 
sometime my daddy, he talked to us. He said he never

14:21.339 --> 14:26.886
going to forget it, the town he lived before. What 
did he mean by that exactly? Why he mean, because

14:32.553 --> 14:36.659
it's his own town. And he said over here in Texas, 
it's kind of hard when somebody he didn't know to

14:38.803 --> 14:47.736
talk English. And that's hard for him.

14:51.943 --> 14:53.245
I see. Did he ever say that he thought being in Texas 
was better than being in Mexico? No, sir. He loved

15:01.398 --> 15:02.659
Texas. The thing is hard for him because he can't 
have a good job. Here in Texas? And he couldn't do

15:09.726 --> 15:10.767
Mexico? Yes. I see. Because he talked on own 
language, Spanish. I see. And over here in Texas,

15:16.693 --> 15:21.257
he need a lot of English to have a good job. But the 
jobs that he had here in Texas, did they pay better

15:23.699 --> 15:29.425
than what he would have had in Mexico? Well, he said 
he paid the same. Paid the same? Yes. But he never

15:35.547 --> 15:37.210
wanted to go back to Mexico? No, sir. He promised 
he'd never come back to Mexico. Did he ever give you

15:40.474 --> 15:42.897
a reason for that? Well, he said he liked Texas, and 
he loved Texas, and he feel more better in Texas. I

15:51.428 --> 15:53.952
see.

15:54.953 --> 15:55.834
Was he... Glad to see the mine shut down, or was he 
upset? No, he's kind of sad when Mr. Guneva caused

15:59.520 --> 16:06.407
the mine, because there's no jobs over here in 
Rockdale. Because what? He don't have no jobs. No

16:09.270 --> 16:09.911
jobs. In Rockdale. I see. Were there many other 
families that were in the same situation? Yes,

16:16.117 --> 16:16.858
sir. There's a lot of people he said a little bit, 
because that's her fault. Did Mr. Coniver try to

16:22.409 --> 16:24.871
help them find jobs? No, sir. He left to San 
Antonio. He went to San Antonio. Yes, sir. He did

16:30.557 --> 16:35.081
let you live at the camp for free after he left? Yes, 
about three months, something like that. I see.

16:40.487 --> 16:42.709
And everybody moved to town. But you and your 
family stayed at the mining camp? Yes, a lot of

16:45.011 --> 16:46.553
them. Did anybody ever come through and tear down 
all the houses and take them away? Take the wood

16:51.957 --> 16:52.998
away? Yes. Somebody, I don't know who, he come and 
get all the houses. Do you remember about how old

16:59.748 --> 17:02.391
you were when that happened? No, sir. But he left 
your house? Yes, sir. I see. So you were the only

17:06.497 --> 17:11.144
family over there on that road that we saw the other 
day? Right. I see.

17:16.391 --> 17:17.172
Do...

17:20.307 --> 17:24.391
If we could go back to the cooking. I've gotten 
conflicting reports. Some people said they

17:26.053 --> 17:27.575
cooked inside. Some people said they had outside 
stoves. Yes, that's the truth. They had both. Yes,

17:32.260 --> 17:34.222
that is the truth. But my mother, he have a heater to 
cook. I see. And we noticed over another mining

17:42.050 --> 17:48.036
camp that we visited after you went home the other 
day, Yes. That there were little brick squares

17:48.572 --> 17:53.099
where the houses should be. Do you have any idea 
what those were? Did you build steps or anything

17:55.483 --> 17:59.209
like that around the houses? Well, the Spanish 
people, he built a lot of things to save some

17:59.790 --> 18:13.450
potatoes

17:59.790 --> 18:13.450
or save something else. I see. So did they put 
bricks around their little gardens? Yes, right. I

18:17.036 --> 18:17.196
see. Did they put little brick patios, for 
instance, in front of their wood houses? Right.

18:24.277 --> 18:28.482
Did the two-room wood houses have wooden floors, 
or were they dirt floors? Sometimes he put it, and

18:28.502 --> 18:32.326
sometimes not, because he no help. I see.

18:37.391 --> 18:38.773
This is going to be a weird question.

18:41.536 --> 18:46.221
Do you remember the so-called Great Depression at 
all? The way you described it, it seems like you

18:46.893 --> 18:51.503
were brought up in a poor family. So I guess you 
really don't know what the Great Depression was?

18:56.333 --> 18:56.573
No. Okay.

19:00.922 --> 19:01.143
All right. How old, if I could ask this, how old were 
you when you got married, and how did you meet your

19:01.203 --> 19:07.095
husband?

19:16.981 --> 19:20.526
If you don't want to answer, that's all right. Did 
you meet him in Rockdale? No, I miss him in Waco. In

19:25.714 --> 19:26.255
Waco. Yes, sir. He's the hometown of my husband. I 
see. He have all the family, all the brothers. He

19:35.068 --> 19:36.049
don't have no mother. He don't have no father, too. 
He pass away. I see. Did you travel to Waco to see

19:40.556 --> 19:42.399
friends? Yes, sir. I have a lot of friends and all 
the family, my husband. I see. But how did you get to

19:47.519 --> 19:50.462
Waco to meet your husband? Did you go there for a 
job? No, sir. He worked over here in Rockdale when I

19:53.567 --> 19:57.111
met my husband. I see. And I worked in a nursing 
home. Oh, I see. And the rest home is possible. I

20:03.059 --> 20:03.379
see. And his father was in the rest home, and that's 
how you met him? Yes, sir. I see. Okay.

20:12.511 --> 20:13.212
Did... Did you ever go to the commissary at the 
Beneath the Mine yourself? No, sir. I see. Your

20:20.396 --> 20:21.037
mother did. Yes, my mother, he did. And when she had 
some credit, she could go over there and buy food?

20:27.185 --> 20:27.826
Yes, sir. Mr. Guneva gave it to her. I see. Did she 
ever tell you any stories about the commissary?

20:35.576 --> 20:38.440
