WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:03.649
We're going to beat that rascal this year. We know 
that a number of the students who were in schools at

00:05.551 --> 00:13.682
the time you were there had various and sundry 
jobs. Were you ever employed while you were a

00:14.784 --> 00:17.647
student? Oh, for three months I calibrated 
electric meters there in the electrical

00:18.028 --> 00:23.495
engineering department. That was all. But quite a 
few of the boys did have that kind of thing. Can you

00:29.103 --> 00:31.506
recall some of the kinds of things that they did? 
old janitor work and that kind of thing and over in

00:32.347 --> 00:53.918
the creamery and probably in the dairy barn and and

00:32.347 --> 00:53.918
oh I don't know it seemed like it might have been a 
minority of those boys and they were probably busy

00:32.347 --> 00:53.918
at the job and off somewhere and you just didn't 
notice it too much. I was wondering did any of them

00:53.978 --> 00:56.301
ever work for any of the professors? You mean in the 
professor's home? Yeah, or do things around. Of

01:04.003 --> 01:07.106
course, I guess the college maintained the houses 
since they owned them. Oh, yes. Well, not in the

01:09.248 --> 01:11.150
professor's homes. They might have, but I don't 
know anything about it.

01:16.336 --> 01:19.519
At that point, I guess there wasn't a whole lot of 
babysitting to do. At a later period, I think some

01:19.879 --> 01:22.963
of them did babysitting for the faculty. Well, in 
that day and time, I don't think there's much

01:22.983 --> 01:29.910
babysitting going on because I didn't know about 
it. Did the students who played on the college

01:31.527 --> 01:43.262
football and baseball and basketball teams and so 
forth have privileges that the other students

01:31.527 --> 01:43.262
didn't have? Oh, yes. They had what they called, 
one thing was the mess hall. They called it the

01:46.706 --> 01:47.908
training table. And of course, they got special 
stakes and those kind of things, and that kind of

01:47.928 --> 01:53.755
thing. I don't believe they had to attend Reveille 
in the morning. You know, they had Reveille every

01:56.466 --> 01:58.715
morning, get out and exercise. I don't believe 
they had to go through that. And they were, a lot of

02:01.125 --> 02:04.639
times they were excused from the evening 
formation, you know, because they didn't get back

02:05.243 --> 02:10.074
in time in that kind of time. They were excused from 
quite a few things like that. They almost had to be

02:13.080 --> 02:14.984
in order to participate. What about, were they, 
were the officers as strict on them as far as their

02:15.826 --> 02:23.944
uniform inspection and so forth is concerned? Oh, 
yes, I think so. I was in the Signal Corps the last

02:25.393 --> 02:32.145
year I was there, and Ruby Drake was one of the 
greatest tackles we ever had down there. Well, he

02:32.205 --> 02:36.632
dressed just like the rest of us, and they 
inspected him just like they did the rest of us. I

02:36.652 --> 02:42.422
know about him because he was, you know, some of 
them, they might have been a little more lax on, but

02:36.652 --> 02:42.422
not Ruby Drake. Okay, during the, I guess this 
would have been what, during your junior year was

02:44.883 --> 02:56.595
when they had the most active participation in the 
First World War. What changes did this bring about

02:57.776 --> 03:04.023
as far as your experiences were concerned? Well, 
it brought about quite a few changes because it

03:05.124 --> 03:13.573
went back down in the

03:05.124 --> 03:13.573
fall of 1918. registered for school. That was when 
the World War was on then. And, you know, all the

03:18.651 --> 03:30.257
upperclassmen had gone to these training camps, 
these juniors and seniors, and that left just

03:18.651 --> 03:30.257
about all that was there was the freshmen and we 
sophomores. And Of course, they had these young

03:33.314 --> 03:39.445
lieutenants come in there to train us, that kind of 
thing, and some of them was only two, three years

03:33.314 --> 03:39.445
older than we were, you know. And it was different 
in a way. We tried to maintain all the customs and

03:43.272 --> 03:51.047
those kind of things, but it was a noticeable 
difference, I think, during that period. But it

03:51.428 --> 03:53.331
didn't last long, thank goodness. I believe it 
only lasted from like September of 1918 to what,

03:53.817 --> 03:59.522
the beginning of the next term. Yes, that's right, 
the next term. You know, we were all enlisted in the

04:01.304 --> 04:17.818
Army there, sworn in, probably about the first of 
October 1918, and then they discharged shortly

04:01.304 --> 04:17.818
after the Armistice, probably early December. I 
don't remember the exact date. Were you enlisted

04:19.399 --> 04:21.941
in what was called the SATC? SATC, Student Army 
Training Corps, yes, sir. And you still attended

04:24.530 --> 04:26.853
GLSIS, I take it? Oh yes, we did, and that's right, 
and we specialized on military, you know, and

04:26.873 --> 04:40.508
these officers would talk to us and train us, and 
they'd begin to sort us out to go to future training

04:26.873 --> 04:40.508
camps in case the war continued. I was slated to go 
to an artillery camp, but you know, the war ended

04:41.409 --> 04:45.633
before I reached that point. And I think the, 
particularly the seniors who came back were,

04:50.399 --> 04:54.263
enrolled in in January, and they did kind of a hurry 
up two semesters. Hurry up a semester. I think they

04:56.285 --> 04:58.067
ran over in June sometime. But it hurried up to get 
them through there and to graduate them. And so

05:01.972 --> 05:10.501
actually, you didn't really have any 
participation in the war effort other than being

05:01.972 --> 05:10.501
in the SATC for a couple months. That's right, on 
the campus, a couple months. Let's

05:14.225 --> 05:19.090
see.

05:25.229 --> 05:33.198
I noticed here from your senior yearbook, you were 
in G Company, what, the first regiment? Yes, sir.

05:35.000 --> 05:35.781
For three years? Yes, sir. And let's see. Company 
of Signal Corps after that. Okay. I have you being

05:40.967 --> 05:50.498
as a fish in Company G1 and a sophomore in Company 
G1, and then you were in a sergeant in G Company, and

05:40.967 --> 05:50.498
then you went to first sergeant in A Company Signal 
Corps. Right, right. When was that, when did you

05:52.162 --> 05:54.486
switch to the signal corps? Was that... That was 
January 1919 when the seniors came back. I was a

06:00.376 --> 06:02.419
first sergeant. That period from January to June. 
So it was kind of, so did all the students then go

06:05.224 --> 06:10.132
through June instead of not just the seniors? The 
whole college. The whole college went until June.

06:13.846 --> 06:17.412
And then a lot of us went to camp, military camp. I 
went back with a group back to Louisville,

06:17.492 --> 06:22.420
Kentucky to an infantry camp after the war, right 
after June. Right after June until then you came

06:22.501 --> 06:28.791
back in September again for the senior year, and 
then you were captain in the Signal Corps then.

06:28.811 --> 06:29.312
Company A. So that's when you got your free pass to 
the theater. Oh, yes. You were also, I take it, in

06:36.364 --> 06:38.948
the RVs. Yeah, I was in the RV, yes, sir. Fine 
organization. What? Fine organization. What was

06:44.742 --> 06:48.666
the procedure for becoming a member of the RVs? 
Well, it was a secret ballot. Of course, I didn't

06:51.249 --> 06:54.192
know my name written proposed. I don't know who 
proposed it. These RVs, they met and then they

06:55.973 --> 07:05.723
announced who they had elected to join the 
organization. And that was in the afternoon, they

07:06.091 --> 07:07.893
announced it. And of course, the RVs then went over 
cases, which was a confectionery in that Y, in

07:08.594 --> 07:18.304
order to box cigars or peas or drinks and charge it 
to the new RVs. And of course, we had to divide up and

07:18.364 --> 07:20.326
pay the bill. So I knew nothing about it until I was 
notified I'd been elected. A happy occasion. What

07:29.555 --> 07:32.318
sort of things did the RVs do? Well, of course, they 
had a dance every year. They called it the RV dance.

07:39.255 --> 07:43.441
And then we had special drills, military drills, 
precision drills. And then at the end of the year,

07:43.461 --> 07:50.250
we'd compete on these drills, who would be the best 
drill man, and that kind of thing. That was within

07:50.590 --> 07:51.632
the RVs? Yes, RVs. So you had kind of a double amount 
of drilling to do then, as you remember. Were you in

07:57.980 --> 08:00.944
the RVs as both a junior and a senior? No. No, my 
senior year, my senior year. But I believe both

08:05.762 --> 08:07.747
juniors and seniors were eligible. Yes, they 
were, but mine, junior year, I mean senior year.

08:11.395 --> 08:14.261
Was that generally the case, most of them were 
seniors? Well, I'd say... I'd say the majority of

08:18.586 --> 08:20.469
them were yes. Yes, I think so. Although, you know, 
they had a nucleus to come on next year to carry the

08:22.031 --> 08:26.598
organization on. I think there's more than 50% of 
them seniors, yes, as I recall. So then you had a

08:30.564 --> 08:35.391
special uniform which you wore just 
occasionally. Yes, that's right. He has a white

08:37.394 --> 08:41.119
uniform and gold braid and all that kind of stuff. 
You wore this to the RV hop and other occasions.

08:43.423 --> 08:46.467
Yeah, the RV hop, yeah, that's right, and the 
drills and... special occasions that we dressed

08:47.543 --> 08:49.947
in the Army uniform.

08:53.412 --> 08:56.156
And I noticed you were also a member of the senior 
court. Yes, I was. In those days, instead of the

08:58.340 --> 09:13.804
military office punishing boys, they decided for 
a while after this senior court made up of seniors

08:58.340 --> 09:13.804
to find out what was going on and the circumstances 
and mete out punishment. to these guilty persons.

09:17.061 --> 09:25.369
And we'd bring the boys in and question them and 
find out both sides, just like a regular court. And

09:25.950 --> 09:28.653
then they'd issue a punishment. And of course, the 
cadet colonel and some of those were on top of it.

09:32.276 --> 09:35.920
And they had a couple of commanders on the thing. 
They tried to get it all over so they'd have

09:35.940 --> 09:38.683
representation. But how many were on the senior 
court? Oh, I'd say Might have been 20, not over 20,

09:43.501 --> 09:47.166
as I recall. This would have been then, say, after 
the World War I, when they did the senior court?

09:51.411 --> 09:51.791
Yes, oh yes. That was my senior year. To my 
knowledge, they didn't have it before then. They

09:54.855 --> 09:55.276
might have. But what sort of infractions would the 
senior court work upon? The violations of

10:02.685 --> 10:04.427
military discipline? Well, yes, and then staying 
over in Brown, maybe without pass, or going

10:04.507 --> 10:12.597
without pass, or... Now I know one case, one of the 
upperclassmen made a very derogatory remark,

10:12.728 --> 10:20.558
there's company command there. Well, they, 
things like that, you know, bring that up and

10:20.578 --> 10:25.524
thrash that out. What did you do then? Did you, you 
would decide upon punishment, would this be

10:26.905 --> 10:31.791
issuing a certain amount of demerits? Demerits, 
that kind of thing, or yes, maybe sometimes they'd

10:31.811 --> 10:40.542
confine them to campus too, you know, and confine 
them to campus, demerits. Were these demerits

10:41.703 --> 10:48.289
then announced at the evening meal as had been the 
custom before? A couple of people I've talked to

10:49.991 --> 10:53.514
said every night at supper they read the RAM list 
for the day. I don't recall that they read the

10:53.534 --> 10:58.418
special. No, I don't recall that. And I don't 
recall the RAM list at mealtime. I don't recall

11:04.524 --> 11:05.925
that. I might do that another period, you know. Not 
in my time. I don't remember. Mm-hmm. I don't think

11:10.711 --> 11:12.153
they did. Okay. I noticed that you have a picture of 
Bevo there with the 13-0 branded on him. Yes, sir.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.909
And this incident occurred while you were there, I 
take it. No. Well, this branding did, yes. Yeah,

11:23.612 --> 11:24.113
yeah. Yeah, branding did. It was a 1915 game. 
That's why I was there. But seniors went over to him

11:27.238 --> 11:31.205
in 1916, I believe it was. They went over to Austin, 
cut old Bevo, and branded him there, 13-0. Mm-hmm.

11:38.555 --> 11:41.270
Yeah, I believe that was early in 1917 they did 
that. My assistant has talked with Hans... roadie

11:46.199 --> 12:12.612
from hondo oh yeah he was one of them i believe yeah 
he wielded the branding iron i believe oh well and

11:46.199 --> 12:12.612
here's um here's a picture there's um goodman hall 
and this is some this is gone yeah that's gone now

11:46.199 --> 12:12.612
that's the drill field nowadays you know back 
there here's the over see the old building

11:46.199 --> 12:12.612
entrance this view this way this was the main 
entrance back out of the old building is now was the

11:46.199 --> 12:12.612
sewer Now, did that fence go all the way around the 
campus? No, no, just the gate there, just the gate.

12:18.066 --> 12:21.715
Just the gate right there at the entranceway from 
near the railroad track. The railroad track's

12:21.735 --> 12:23.599
both right over here, two of them, you know. There 
was not a road between the railroad track and

12:23.619 --> 12:27.428
the... Today, there's a paved highway that runs 
from Bryan through Welburn, and I believe it runs

12:28.285 --> 12:34.173
all the way to Navasota. I believe there's a road 
between the railroad tracks and this gate, I

12:34.273 --> 12:39.561
believe, at that time, yes, coming from Bryan. 
Yes, because that's the only way to get to Bryan in

12:39.701 --> 12:41.463
those days. You didn't have that other road, no. 
Yeah, it wasn't paved. No, it was gravel probably.

12:46.250 --> 12:46.670
Okay. Here, did you ever see this picture? That's 
the Rye Sal. Did you ever see that? I have seen a

12:52.479 --> 12:54.061
different picture of it. I haven't seen this one. 
Well, that, you know, we got that in 1916. Here's a

12:58.068 --> 13:00.112
uniform we wore in 1916, see? This is Spieser Hall. 
And we had this thing locked up on the fourth floor,

13:02.977 --> 13:10.069
I believe, the Old Main, which was the Army at that 
time, and the sergeants guarded. But, you know, I

13:10.470 --> 13:12.353
guess you heard this story. The Rice boys came up 
there and captured this thing. And I've always

13:15.839 --> 13:17.462
thought that the... The feds at the university got 
together. They didn't want to keep this thing, so

13:20.378 --> 13:26.727
they said, you send your boys up and we'll make sure 
you get it. Well, our boys chased them, they said,

13:27.308 --> 13:34.417
all the way back to Houston trying to catch them, 
but they never caught them. Rodie, I think, told us

13:34.918 --> 13:36.740
a little bit about that. He said something about 
that Rice boys had hired a detective. to come over

13:42.029 --> 13:43.792
and investigate. And he supposedly posed as a 
sports writer and found out where it was and let the

13:43.812 --> 13:50.822
Rice boys know where it was. Well, I don't know the 
details. I always thought maybe Dr. Brazell got

13:53.025 --> 13:58.994
with the president of Rice and said, well, now 
we've had our fun. Come and get it. I don't know what

13:59.816 --> 14:00.637
he said. Well, it's always a possibility. That's 
right. Here's the, that's what you look like in

14:02.720 --> 14:07.547
those days. Let me ask you this question. Over here 
from the left, there's a track. Is this the

14:12.929 --> 14:15.014
Tunerville Trolley track through here?

14:17.920 --> 14:18.321
Let me see. Where's the mess hall? Let me see. The 
mess hall was on. Oh, yeah, right here. Yeah, right

14:25.771 --> 14:26.452
here. You boarded it right over here, just west of 
it. That was the termination of it. And then it went

14:31.181 --> 14:33.245
right out this way over to Bryan. And this was a spur 
from one or the other, either the INGN or the HNTC, I

14:34.828 --> 14:41.762
guess, to bring... I suppose so, yes, to bring the 
material and things into the station, college.

14:46.912 --> 14:47.052
Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's go back to this picture of Bevo 
for a minute, and let me ask you about this. We have

14:55.317 --> 15:06.333
on one copy, we have two or three copies of this 
picture in the archives, and on the back of one,

14:55.317 --> 15:06.333
there's a couple of clippings. One of the 
clippings indicates that sometime after this

15:06.994 --> 15:16.988
branding, Bevo was slaughtered. They had a 
banquet over at Austin in January of 1920, to which

15:17.339 --> 15:26.513
some people from A&M and people from the 
University of Texas were invited. They had a

15:27.134 --> 15:33.363
barbecue banquet over at the gymnasium in Austin. 
And since that supposedly occurred when you were

15:33.944 --> 15:41.676
there, I wondered if you heard anything about it. a 
banquet of that nature. No, if I knew about it, it

15:43.511 --> 15:46.053
would slip my mind. I don't recall that. Well, we 
have this clipping that's not dated, but we also

15:47.275 --> 16:06.094
have an invitation that's the size of a regular 
sheet of paper, 8 1⁄2 by 11, has a picture of Bevo

15:47.275 --> 16:06.094
before the branding, plus an invitation at the 
bottom which indicates that he was slaughtered,

15:47.275 --> 16:06.094
and he was January 22, 1920. I see. I don't recall 
that. I'll tell you one incident happened over at

16:10.066 --> 16:13.651
Austin, I remember, when I was about a sophomore. A 
whole bunch of them went over there. We were

16:15.753 --> 16:18.236
playing basketball at the University of Texas in 
their gym. And I believe it was between the half, we

16:19.257 --> 16:24.764
were on one side and the T-Sips on the other side. 
And they turned a possum loose on that court with

16:25.344 --> 16:28.328
our colors on it. Well, you know what happened. To 
my knowledge, the game was never finished. I

16:33.013 --> 16:34.535
wasn't there when it finished anyway. How we got 
back to College Station, I don't remember. But I

16:39.267 --> 16:41.451
imagine you had a general melee. A general 
meeting, anyway. Oh, boy, gosh.

16:50.008 --> 16:57.122
Okay, then you graduated then in the spring or May 
or June of 1920. May the 20th, 1920. And did you then

17:02.504 --> 17:07.052
have a job at the time you graduated, or did you 
enter the job market at that point? No, City

17:07.072 --> 17:15.526
Service sent a representative down to College 
Station in the spring of 1920 to interview people,

17:07.072 --> 17:15.526
and three of us in the class signed up. But when we 
got out of school in the May, we were committed to

17:20.780 --> 17:24.905
for our ROTC commitment to attend a signal corps 
camp back in Little Silver, New Jersey. So we went

17:25.485 --> 17:32.493
back there and I took up my employment in first 
September by agreement with city service. And

17:34.295 --> 17:36.537
where did you go for your first job? Bartleville, 
Oklahoma. That was the headquarters of the city

17:37.558 --> 17:40.221
service oil company at that time. Okay, and I think 
you said you were with city service? 42 years in

17:47.577 --> 17:48.459
711. 42 years in 711. So you never worked for 
anybody else? Nobody. Could you tell me a little

17:52.345 --> 17:57.855
bit about what you did for city service? Well, I 
worked in the other department, except the

17:57.875 --> 18:01.702
treasurer wouldn't trust me there. But I worked in 
the... We started out, we had a junior engineer's

18:01.722 --> 18:09.476
course, kind of a training course where they'd 
send you around to all the departments, kind of get

18:01.722 --> 18:09.476
acquainted and learn how. Then I was in the 
engineering department. surveying and drafting

18:12.265 --> 18:41.125
and things like that and then I was in the pipeline 
department kind of overseeing or supervising

18:12.265 --> 18:41.125
contractors who were laying pipelines for us and 
then at that time we had an appraisal department

18:12.265 --> 18:41.125
that appraised all of our properties and I was 
serving that department as an engineer and then I

18:12.265 --> 18:41.125
when I then in 19 then In the early 40s, the Federal 
Power Commission started cracking down all the

18:42.134 --> 18:50.446
utilities to get them to establish the original 
cost and that kind of thing. And I served in the

18:50.466 --> 18:58.918
rates department of our company several years, 
establishing original cost and that kind of thing

18:50.466 --> 18:58.918
with companies. And I put in the last 19 years my 
tenure as a subsidiary of the City Service Gas

19:00.520 --> 19:11.977
Company in Oklahoma City in the rates and sales 
department.

19:11.997 --> 19:12.057
OK. um

19:12.340 --> 19:22.898
then you you retired from city service uh what year 
60 and retired april 1st 1963. 63. did you move

19:22.918 --> 19:30.130
directly to amarillo at that point well when i 
retired we put our house for sale up in Oklahoma

19:30.565 --> 19:36.996
City and since I've been camping out for two years, 
native Texan, I want to get back to Texas. My wife,

19:37.517 --> 19:39.581
all her family lived here. Her son lived in Denver. 
Well, we put her house up for sale and in about five

19:41.885 --> 19:48.777
months we sold it and moved here and bought this 
house. So it was because of family then that you,

19:48.824 --> 19:53.553
family connections, that you moved down the road? 
Well, yes. I visited here many, many times, wife,

19:53.954 --> 19:58.583
brothers, and we loved the climate here. It was a 
wonderful climate. Best in the country. Best in

20:01.108 --> 20:02.470
the world. Where did you meet your wife? I met her in 
Bartlesville, Oklahoma. She was working for city

20:06.158 --> 20:11.608
service when I joined the organization, and I met 
her there. Okay, Bartlesville was the

20:11.740 --> 20:14.524
headquarters, national headquarters? Well, no, 
New York City was the national headquarters, but

20:14.544 --> 20:23.857
Bartlesville was the next headquarters for the 
oil company activities. Okay.

20:28.284 --> 20:34.713
What sort of things have you been involved in since 
you have come to Amarillo? Well, of course, I

20:36.315 --> 20:39.840
belong with the... local camera club in Oklahoma 
City and I've continued my activities in the

20:40.428 --> 20:46.316
camera club here. I put our slides up to judge and 
score. One year I was president of the American

20:49.120 --> 21:09.608
Association of Retired Persons organization 
here in town and I attend and take part in Sunday

20:49.120 --> 21:09.608
school and church activities every week and on 
politics I distribute pamphlets and call on the

20:49.120 --> 21:09.608
neighbors and that kind of thing to get them out to 
vote, and do a little gardening and keep up my yard.

21:16.819 --> 21:18.921
But you haven't actually entered politics 
yourself. No, no, I don't intend to. No, no.

21:21.723 --> 21:24.446
They'll deliver me. No, no. Well, I think you had 
one more picture there. Oh, here's the Aggie team

21:27.569 --> 21:31.773
in 1919, Southwest Champions. See, that's all the 
players we had. Well, that wouldn't even make the

21:33.294 --> 21:35.336
watering squad now. Yeah. You know, in 19... As I 
recall, DX, we played Texas University at College

21:38.444 --> 21:42.930
Station. We had one coach, DX, an assistant, and a 
colored ball for the rubdown. That's all we had.

21:48.778 --> 21:52.643
And he coached track or something else. I can't 
recall whether this is a fact, but DX put in 11

21:52.683 --> 21:56.087
players. And if I recall correctly, he didn't have 
a timeout or a substitution. You might check that

22:00.433 --> 22:01.895
someplace. Mm-hmm. Well, I think they were much 
stricter on what you could have in the, for, you

22:02.373 --> 22:09.143
know, I think at that point you couldn't call a 
timeout just because you wanted to. No, and if you

22:09.263 --> 22:14.952
played in one quarter and come out, you couldn't go 
back in that quarter. And we beat them seven to

22:14.972 --> 22:18.618
nothing, and we marched right on through. But, 
boy, we had some real old boys in those days. Here's

22:22.584 --> 22:25.328
old, here's old Kempmutter.

22:27.652 --> 22:27.992
Boy, yeah. What's that little figure written? 
Well, that looks like somebody standing way back

22:30.480 --> 22:34.606
there in the background, looks like. Let's see. 
Here's Harrison right here. You know, he lives

22:40.174 --> 22:41.476
over in Brown. Chick Harrison. You know Chick 
Harrison? R.H. Harrison? He's a class agent with

22:46.143 --> 22:47.485
the class of 20. He lives in Brown, isn't he? I don't 
know him personally. I probably have heard of him.

22:51.251 --> 22:52.412
Chick Harrison. R.H. Harrison.

22:57.420 --> 22:57.520
Yeah. Okay. Okay. I guess that was the high point in 
A&M athletics when they had... Well, in 1917, they

22:58.010 --> 23:03.736
weren't scored on either. Right here. That tells 
the story. This was... Well, that's 1919. Well, in

23:10.104 --> 23:12.566
1917, they weren't scored on either. So you had 
1917, and the 1919 football teams were not scored

23:12.827 --> 23:17.071
on at all? No, they weren't. We played LSU. This is 
my wife. This is Mr. Sheward. How you do? Well, he's

23:23.859 --> 23:25.724
been asking me all kinds of questions. Did you? 
Well, yeah, you want to fix one?
