WEBVTT

00:03.119 --> 00:05.362
Two, two, three, one, two, three.

00:08.907 --> 00:12.312
Three, two, one, three, two, one, three, two, one.

00:16.357 --> 00:16.457
Okay.

00:16.477 --> 00:18.380
First, we're checking this machine.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.384
This is October the first, 1999.

00:22.165 --> 00:30.156
We're on the seventh floor of the Rudder Tower, and I have the honor of chatting with Dr. Dale Leeper today about the

00:30.845 --> 00:41.214
beginning and great progress of the oceanography program here, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary at this time.

00:42.255 --> 00:46.419
Dr. Lieber, briefly, let's test your mic.

00:47.640 --> 00:53.465
Okay, I don't know what to say by way of a test, but I'm here, and I do remember a lot of these 50 years.

00:53.985 --> 00:54.606
Okay, that's good.

00:56.007 --> 00:59.350
By the way, do you have a card, a personal card?

01:02.350 --> 01:08.800
Dr. Lieber to start with, make believe that someone had not seen a resume for you.

01:08.820 --> 01:19.135
Would you briefly review your background, your experience growing up in college and so forth before you came to A&M?

01:20.477 --> 01:20.898
Briefly.

01:21.699 --> 01:23.802
Well, I wanted to be a,

01:24.946 --> 01:27.371
a high school teacher of mathematics.

01:27.993 --> 01:42.263
I headed that way and actually got a bachelor's from Wittenberg University in math with education and then a master's from Ohio State University and then went to California.

01:42.496 --> 01:50.193
I worked for a teacher credential in California and also later for a Ph.D.

01:50.213 --> 01:52.919
there in meteorology and oceanography.

01:52.959 --> 02:02.800
That was at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which is about 125 miles south of UCLA, but UCLA was the administrative office.

02:02.780 --> 02:13.119
So, then I was ready to teach, but it was February, so I worked in an airplane factory for about six months, got into the San Diego school systems.

02:13.781 --> 02:20.974
After teaching in Pacific Beach for one year, I was drafted and taken into the Army just

02:21.005 --> 02:22.968
about three months before the war started.

02:23.890 --> 02:32.463
So in the Army, I went to the infantry and the Signal Corps, and I found if you'd have math and physics, you could apply for meteorology.

02:32.503 --> 02:36.109
I didn't know what that was, but it was better than what I was doing, I'm sure.

02:36.129 --> 02:47.147
So I got one solid year of education during the war in the Air Force at UCLA University of Chicago and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

02:48.578 --> 02:54.327
Then in 1943, I got to come back from the Aleutian Islands where I was forecasting.

02:55.188 --> 02:58.774
Spent three months at Scripps and back up to Alaska.

02:59.495 --> 03:05.464
After Alaska, I had the opportunity of going to Berkeley University or to Scripps.

03:06.265 --> 03:09.991
Both offers were the same, half time, a chance to work toward a doctor's degree.

03:11.373 --> 03:15.700
The Berkeley one was in the Department of Civil Engineering to start a program in hydrology.

03:16.253 --> 03:29.010
I'd never had a course in civil engineering, so I was a little worried about that, plus the La Jolla Scripps Institution was close to where I'd lived, so I went back there and got a Ph.D.

03:29.030 --> 03:30.071
in 1950.

03:31.273 --> 03:40.565
Meantime, the opening came up in Texas, and I accepted that and came here in August of 1949.

03:40.605 --> 03:45.872
How did you know about A&M's

03:46.122 --> 03:48.926
dreams of having a program in oceanography?

03:50.508 --> 04:03.043
Well, the research foundation here had a director named A. A. Jekula, a civil engineer, author of a textbook in civil engineering, a very nice person and a very effective administrator.

04:04.025 --> 04:08.991
He had organized a research project to satisfy the oil company's need to know

04:09.443 --> 04:13.489
about what happened to the oysters on the coast, the great oyster mortality.

04:13.709 --> 04:15.412
He had 90 scientists involved.

04:16.213 --> 04:20.700
In doing that, the group of them decided the missing link was oceanography.

04:21.281 --> 04:27.049
Dr. Jackler proposed a department to the board of directors and the board set it up within two weeks.

04:27.430 --> 04:28.531
That was January 1949.

04:28.551 --> 04:37.645
Now, the way I heard about it was Dr. Jackler formed a committee to help him choose a department head.

04:38.333 --> 04:47.571
This committee consisted of the director of Scripps Institution, Harold Sverdrup, and a senior biologist there, Claude Zobel.

04:48.533 --> 04:56.528
Those two people recommended me and Robert O. Reed as possible chairman before we had our PhDs.

04:57.301 --> 05:05.569
Reed soon decided he did not want to go into administration, so I won the difficult contest for head of department.

05:06.029 --> 05:11.374
So I heard about it through Dr. Jack, the search for department head.

05:12.015 --> 05:17.039
Did they come to California to visit with you or did you meet them somewhere?

05:17.099 --> 05:19.702
What was the recruitment process?

05:21.423 --> 05:22.704
I don't even remember that.

05:23.105 --> 05:25.587
What I remember is being invited to A&M

05:26.039 --> 05:28.421
for an interview and this was in May 1949.

05:28.542 --> 05:36.049
So I came and the interview I had was with Dr. Jack then Dean Thomas Harrington, M.T.

05:36.069 --> 05:42.556
Harrington and President Bolton on just a short interview, no details.

05:43.237 --> 05:45.939
They wanted to start a department of oceanography.

05:46.660 --> 05:51.585
My main question was, are you interested in a regional approach or just a campus department?

05:52.086 --> 05:55.489
There was no question in their mind, the regional approach was wanted.

05:56.110 --> 06:00.877
and that was all we covered in that interview, no details about oceanography.

06:01.598 --> 06:04.222
Regional meant the entire Gulf Coast?

06:04.262 --> 06:06.144
We didn't say, that's what I meant.

06:09.109 --> 06:15.097
Describe your impression of Texas A&M at that first visit.

06:16.860 --> 06:18.883
Oh boy, that's a difficult question.

06:19.704 --> 06:25.392
The key thing I remember is it was hot and moist and that the people were awfully nice.

06:25.996 --> 06:30.204
And really, the only ones I talked to in any detail were the three whom I'd mentioned.

06:31.426 --> 06:37.456
But I found there was a campus-wide interest in this new program and getting a program started.

06:37.757 --> 06:42.225
And Dr. Jackley had laid a groundwork, which made it very easy for someone to jump in.

06:43.808 --> 06:45.591
My impression of Texas A&M?

06:47.242 --> 06:48.744
I didn't even try to make one.

06:48.844 --> 06:51.307
I decided it was a good place.

06:51.968 --> 06:58.477
You see, what had happened on the Gulf Coast before is people had tried to build an oceanographic institution on the coast.

06:58.938 --> 07:06.027
Florida State, Texas University, Louisiana State, they built laboratories on the coast.

07:06.833 --> 07:16.185
Well, that's near the water, but you don't have libraries, you don't have mechanical departments, you don't have physics departments or biology departments or administrative setup.

07:17.087 --> 07:21.352
So getting back from the coast to 150 miles was quite an advantage.

07:22.013 --> 07:26.579
You could then look at a broader scope and you had the facilities to tackle a big problem with.

07:27.721 --> 07:36.452
Did you sense a general, meaning broad, positive attitude about the creation of the program?

07:36.922 --> 07:37.823
Oh, I really did.

07:37.843 --> 07:53.607
And this came largely from the heads of the Department of Chemistry, Fred Jensen, the head of the Department of Biology, Doak, the Biochemistry Nutrition Department, the Physics Department.

07:54.428 --> 07:56.672
The whole university seemed interesting.

07:56.692 --> 08:03.081
The reason for this is that the old project had given people a chance to do an interesting kind of research.

08:03.302 --> 08:05.545
It had given them a source of income during the summer.

08:06.537 --> 08:13.847
And they'd gotten all these people involved in marine programs and they didn't know anything about the currents or the tides or the sea air interaction.

08:14.488 --> 08:17.892
So they wanted somebody to fill in that gap.

08:18.713 --> 08:21.517
I will not ask about salary except this one.

08:21.537 --> 08:24.061
Do you remember what your opening salary was?

08:24.081 --> 08:24.962
Oh sure, sure I do.

08:24.982 --> 08:25.663
$6,000.

08:25.683 --> 08:27.265
$6,000.

08:28.627 --> 08:29.608
That was a big deal.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.904
At Scripps, when I went there, it was for $3,000.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.067
That was halftime.

08:34.230 --> 08:37.718
But the salary looked okay.

08:37.738 --> 08:38.740
We had four children.

08:39.823 --> 08:45.235
I don't remember whether they were all there at that time or not, but the salary was fine.

08:45.620 --> 08:51.585
And when you arrived to begin your duties in June?

08:51.946 --> 08:52.686
No, in August.

08:52.867 --> 08:53.607
August of 59.

08:53.627 --> 08:54.768
49.

08:54.908 --> 08:55.169
I mean 49.

08:55.189 --> 08:56.070
49, right.

08:57.671 --> 09:03.496
Describe the department's physical facilities at that point.

09:04.237 --> 09:14.226
Well, we were given two rooms in Goodwin Hall, which is just across the field there, two rooms on the third floor, and I was the only employee.

09:14.763 --> 09:22.655
Down below, there were two other rooms, which were assigned to Wayne Stark, who had just come with the mission of creating the Memorial Student Center.

09:23.196 --> 09:26.661
Same time, same place, same opportunity.

09:27.983 --> 09:32.190
How marvelous that those were beginning there.

09:34.674 --> 09:41.985
Let's see, and as far as you're aware, the idea for oceanography originated with Dr. Jackula.

09:42.961 --> 09:49.574
through the project that he'd sponsored on the coast and contact with the scientists not only from A&M but from around the world.

09:51.017 --> 09:53.562
And he was a very wise individual.

09:54.904 --> 09:55.105
All right.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.730
How did you put that first faculty together?

09:58.165 --> 10:00.608
Oh, boy.

10:02.490 --> 10:11.079
My orders were, here are five full-time academic appointments, and here's $50,000.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.122
Build us an oceanography program.

10:15.644 --> 10:22.992
Now, there were no committees, no administrative controls, except the usual stuff.

10:23.798 --> 10:27.144
And I was perfectly free to do what I could with those appointments.

10:27.164 --> 10:31.372
But this is one of the nicest things that any university has ever done for a department.

10:31.432 --> 10:40.790
Just give five full-time academic appointments without regard to student-teacher ratio or research income or anything.

10:40.810 --> 10:41.892
I had those appointments.

10:42.175 --> 10:49.083
And I had them for 10 years, which is unheard of any place, I think, on the campus.

10:50.725 --> 10:54.109
So you ask how the faculty was going together.

10:54.930 --> 11:03.260
I decided instead of specializing, which many labs had done, for example, I think there were 69 marine labs around the coast.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.842
They were all biological.

11:05.294 --> 11:07.118
There were two or three that were geological.

11:07.820 --> 11:09.564
Physical oceanography, just a couple.

11:10.868 --> 11:14.757
So what I decided to do, we were interested in teaching.

11:14.817 --> 11:16.722
That was our prime goal.

11:17.714 --> 11:29.127
And I wanted our students to have contact with a real biologist, a solid biologist, a solid chemist, a solid geologist, and solid meteorology and physics.

11:30.769 --> 11:46.708
So I decided to assign one of these openings to each of those sciences, and one quarter of the $50,000, one fifth of the $50,000.

11:47.279 --> 11:49.341
The first person we hired was a secretary.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.587
This, maybe I can put this in before the faculty.

11:55.488 --> 11:59.793
I was interested in him pulling in all the meteorological capability I could.

11:59.873 --> 12:02.456
I'd had just three years in the Air Force in meteorology.

12:03.177 --> 12:10.245
So I was able to hire a graduate of UCLA with a bachelor's in meteorology to become a secretary.

12:11.266 --> 12:11.926
And she did.

12:13.588 --> 12:16.071
But we had no faculty member.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.459
the first term.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.642
I taught one course, Introduction to Oceanography.

12:21.922 --> 12:26.967
I think we had 54 people sign up for that, just for information.

12:28.309 --> 12:34.195
So this course had a field trip down to Corpus Christi along the coast.

12:34.595 --> 12:38.099
And one of the guides we'd asked for was W. Armstrong Price.

12:39.019 --> 12:46.547
A fellow 60 years old, spent all his life on the Gulf Coast, was well known and well respected in geology

12:47.033 --> 12:51.337
not a no-snuggler, but we made a deal.

12:51.377 --> 12:52.878
He came and he spent 50 years.

12:52.918 --> 12:57.302
Now, he arrived in February, in other words, the end of the first semester that I was there.

12:58.943 --> 13:09.273
Since he was 60, his office, we gave him one of the rooms, and they had to have a cot in the office so he could take his afternoon nap, but he was a very active person.

13:10.474 --> 13:15.538
He stayed until age 65 when he had to retire, and then he went on.

13:15.788 --> 13:21.994
given an honor by a symposium in his 80s, and he kept giving papers until he was in his 90s.

13:22.014 --> 13:22.775
He died in 93.

13:22.835 --> 13:26.359
That's the first appointment, a geological one.

13:26.859 --> 13:33.426
He was a good geologist, and we said, well, we'll help him learn the oceanography part.

13:33.986 --> 13:36.529
The next one was a biologist.

13:36.569 --> 13:45.778
Now here, Dr. Jackley had run this big project on the coast, a couple million dollars, and he asked me if I could find a place for

13:46.383 --> 13:49.508
the head of that project, who was John Mackin, a biologist.

13:50.449 --> 13:53.113
That's the only request that Jackula ever made of me.

13:53.393 --> 13:54.294
I said, sure we could.

13:54.314 --> 14:02.506
So we got a good, solid biologist with experience on the Gulf Coast who filled the biological place, could not report until the end of the first year.

14:05.290 --> 14:06.873
Now it came to chemistry.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.056
We announced the opening in chemistry.

14:10.137 --> 14:15.445
In the country at that time, I think there were two chemical oceanographers, one at Yale and one at the Scripps Institution.

14:16.066 --> 14:19.109
But a young fellow came wandering in one day.

14:19.129 --> 14:22.553
He says he's about to get his degree in biochemistry and nutrition.

14:23.073 --> 14:26.777
That was a very popular field, much in demand, especially at that time.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.520
But this fellow wanted to stay in a college station.

14:29.720 --> 14:33.324
He wanted a job which did not time to a desk or an office.

14:34.365 --> 14:36.988
And so he said, what's this oceanography stuff?

14:37.809 --> 14:39.971
Well, that was Donald Hood who's here tonight.

14:40.692 --> 14:41.773
That's part of my talk, see.

14:42.794 --> 14:45.297
And he became the chemical oceanographer.

14:45.918 --> 14:51.608
We were able to make a deal with him in the second semester, but he didn't come until the next year.

14:53.011 --> 15:00.624
So now I'm through the biological, the geological, the chemical, and I come to the physical and the meteorological.

15:01.185 --> 15:03.309
The meteorological is a new thing we define.

15:03.369 --> 15:07.977
What it means is you have a background, a bachelor's in meteorology, and then you come into oceanography.

15:09.087 --> 15:13.692
Well, the fellow at Scripps had been offered a chance at the headship, turned it down.

15:13.732 --> 15:21.600
I've been working with him for a couple of years out there, talking to him about coming to A&M, and he'd be, yes, he would, and then, no, they didn't teach him.

15:22.520 --> 15:27.626
The director of Scripps told me once that if they ever lost anybody, they should never lose Robert O. Reed.

15:28.887 --> 15:37.035
But he decided to come here, and, well, there's quite a story about

15:37.471 --> 15:39.434
how this happened, I don't know whether to go into that.

15:39.695 --> 15:39.915
Go ahead.

15:43.942 --> 15:52.397
Okay, and he decided to come and was ready to move, and this would now be in 1951, a couple years into the program.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.042
But Reed had a background in engineering.

15:55.222 --> 16:00.912
He had the three years of military meteorology, and then he had gone to Scripps to do oceanography.

16:01.013 --> 16:02.415
He had not gotten his degree.

16:02.783 --> 16:05.326
A German was giving bad time, give us all a bad time.

16:05.966 --> 16:10.251
They used these classical German paragraphs, and we just couldn't, I got through it.

16:10.751 --> 16:15.557
Bob, we even had him go back for a semester to work on that, and he still didn't.

16:15.577 --> 16:17.599
They wanted to keep him.

16:17.659 --> 16:21.062
They were ready to move to A&M.

16:21.983 --> 16:23.205
Their friendship was in a van.

16:23.805 --> 16:25.507
The director of Scripps was in Washington.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.289
He called up and said, hold that van.

16:27.995 --> 16:33.482
And then he called a meeting in Washington with me, who I happened to be there too, and he got two witnesses.

16:34.944 --> 16:38.248
And we talked about whether Bob should stay at Scripps or should come to A&M.

16:39.670 --> 16:43.955
And when the talk was finished, he turned to one of the witnesses, who was Richard Fleming.

16:43.975 --> 16:48.181
Fleming's one of the authors of The Oceans and the director of the program at University of Washington.

16:48.201 --> 16:50.463
He said, Dick, what do you think Bob Reed should do?

16:50.503 --> 16:53.327
And Dick said, I think he should go to Texas A&M.

16:55.838 --> 16:57.862
So they called up and released the van.

16:59.124 --> 17:09.683
And then, well, I told Marjorie, his wife, that College Station had the same annual average temperature as La Jolla, California did.

17:10.344 --> 17:13.450
And it had the same average annual wind speed as La Jolla did.

17:14.552 --> 17:16.395
And she's never forgiven me for that.

17:17.810 --> 17:20.776
And when they came, they had a house.

17:21.557 --> 17:23.000
We took them out to see their house.

17:23.762 --> 17:24.684
There was a hail storm.

17:25.365 --> 17:28.151
The hail was so big you could not move from the car to the house.

17:30.235 --> 17:31.036
So that was their start.

17:31.056 --> 17:36.848
But he, of course, has become a very distinguished professor, a member of the National Academy of Engineering.

17:37.503 --> 17:46.036
It turned out a group of students who were combination oceanographers, meteorologists, who have taken many key positions throughout the country.

17:46.637 --> 17:47.959
So he was the fifth person.

17:48.721 --> 18:01.000
What I did, in other words, instead of getting a physical oceanographer from physics and meteorological from meteorology, I got Reed and I both who had some meteorology and some physics, and he had the engineering too.

18:01.421 --> 18:02.903
So that's the original staff.

18:03.220 --> 18:10.429
Now, you began then in the fall of, the academic year beginning in the fall of 1960.

18:11.118 --> 18:14.843
You began to teach wider variety of courses?

18:14.863 --> 18:15.423
50, 50.

18:15.904 --> 18:18.728
I mean 50, again, yeah.

18:18.748 --> 18:23.113
So in 1950, you began to offer a variety of courses.

18:23.173 --> 18:27.278
Now what this means, you see, I'm there in fall of 49.

18:27.599 --> 18:33.706
If you're going to offer a curriculum the next year, you've got some work to do.

18:35.008 --> 18:35.809
I had to write.

18:36.464 --> 18:48.737
the abstracts and the course outlines for 13 graduate courses before the faculty was there in order to get them in the catalog and announce a curriculum for the following fall.

18:48.757 --> 18:56.806
Did you have any problems with the campus bureaucracy in getting the degree program and the courses approved?

18:57.587 --> 19:02.252
Normally, I would have had all kinds of problems, but in this case, like I told you,

19:03.059 --> 19:05.522
The groundwork had been laid by Dr. Jack.

19:05.722 --> 19:15.933
These department heads, those four departments, when you get them together, geology, physics, math, chemistry, and let's see, I left out one.

19:16.433 --> 19:20.257
But if you have the heads of those departments behind you, you have no problems.

19:20.758 --> 19:25.483
And the graduate dean likewise, Dean Ied Trotter, and he was very helpful.

19:25.943 --> 19:27.565
And the graduate council,

19:29.097 --> 19:29.898
Couldn't believe it.

19:29.918 --> 19:33.462
And the Dean of Arts and Sciences at that point was?

19:33.723 --> 19:34.263
Was M.T.

19:34.284 --> 19:34.804
Harrington.

19:34.844 --> 19:36.226
Dr. Harrington, a chemist.

19:36.747 --> 19:37.267
That's right.

19:37.508 --> 19:38.028
That's right.

19:38.909 --> 19:47.861
And if they could all be here today, which one would you thank most for their help in getting it started?

19:49.743 --> 19:53.648
Well, Jackula would thank most and M.T.

19:53.668 --> 19:54.649
Harrington for,

19:55.135 --> 19:59.039
understanding what Jackie was saying and allowing it or helping do it.

19:59.939 --> 20:00.140
All right.

20:00.200 --> 20:05.184
Then in the fall of 1950, did you have some students ready?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.265
Oh, yeah.

20:06.305 --> 20:07.226
That's the amazing thing.

20:08.167 --> 20:09.428
We put this in the catalog.

20:09.548 --> 20:11.790
We put up a flag and said, we're starting oceanography.

20:12.251 --> 20:15.554
Now, when you put up a flag, it doesn't matter much what it is or where it is.

20:16.174 --> 20:16.715
It pulls.

20:17.916 --> 20:22.700
So that fall, there were six students who signed up for a master's program in oceanography.

20:23.221 --> 20:24.822
Where did they come from primarily?

20:25.004 --> 20:26.406
They were mostly Texans.

20:26.446 --> 20:35.138
And every one of them got his masters within two years, which I'm very proud of, yeah.

20:35.158 --> 20:43.049
And you still had no oceanography labs yet.

20:43.750 --> 20:49.898
When did you begin to get some additional space other than those two rooms in Goodwin Hall?

20:51.059 --> 20:58.669
Well, first thing we got was a residence on the campus, a seven-room residence.

20:59.730 --> 21:03.455
And we put the hydrographic lab in the bedroom and the offices downstairs.

21:04.456 --> 21:08.121
And that was over here by G. Riley White, I think, somewhere.

21:08.821 --> 21:09.642
Just a residence.

21:10.383 --> 21:15.490
And then we went there so very long, old science became available.

21:15.550 --> 21:19.615
Now, old science was beside the library where biology is now.

21:19.595 --> 21:23.541
And I guess biology had moved out.

21:23.782 --> 21:24.382
It was empty.

21:25.144 --> 21:26.065
It was classrooms.

21:26.225 --> 21:28.088
There were 13 major classrooms.

21:28.769 --> 21:29.871
Nobody wanted that building.

21:30.392 --> 21:30.893
It was old.

21:32.355 --> 21:34.198
You'd look at a ceiling, you'd see a crack.

21:34.558 --> 21:37.423
A wall toward the library was out four inches from the ceiling.

21:38.224 --> 21:41.830
So we were given that building, 13 rooms, and we had 13 people.

21:43.052 --> 21:47.779
And that enabled us to grow quite a bit.

21:47.962 --> 21:51.767
We had a machinist who ordered a drill press that became available on surplus.

21:51.807 --> 21:56.654
The drill press arrived, and the driver came in, and he said, oh, I can't bring that in here.

21:56.674 --> 21:57.175
It's too heavy.

21:57.215 --> 21:58.436
You can't drive on these roads.

22:00.199 --> 22:01.921
It was surplus and free drill press.

22:02.502 --> 22:05.927
But anyhow, we made great use of the old science building.

22:07.469 --> 22:12.636
And then what happened after that, I believe, was when we moved back into Goodwin.

22:13.392 --> 22:19.518
And we took over the whole building this time, plus the whole building of Bazell next to it.

22:20.338 --> 22:22.961
And that was about seven years after we started the program.

22:23.381 --> 22:31.488
Did you have any off-campus requirements in terms of getting authority to do anything?

22:31.989 --> 22:33.890
Did you have to get any approval in Austin?

22:34.111 --> 22:34.311
Yeah.

22:35.572 --> 22:43.399
I don't know whether we had to or not, but we did.

22:44.476 --> 22:54.449
Commission on Higher Education, approved our programs in oceanography and meteorology as the lead programs in Texas.

22:54.489 --> 22:56.672
I guess that's what they designate them to be.

22:58.275 --> 23:01.359
And when did you begin to do doctoral level?

23:02.160 --> 23:04.283
We turned out our first doctoral people in 1953.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.568
So we had some kind of approval for them.

23:09.470 --> 23:14.196
And no campus or statewide handicap

23:14.834 --> 23:15.815
or obstacles there?

23:17.557 --> 23:20.641
No, not then, but about 1958 we hit one.

23:21.783 --> 23:22.323
How was that?

23:22.804 --> 23:23.304
What was that?

23:25.988 --> 23:33.857
We got a building on the beach in Galveston, a beautiful building, 60,000 square feet right on the beach.

23:35.479 --> 23:37.882
The federal agency was through with it.

23:38.663 --> 23:39.965
It was listed as surplus.

23:40.526 --> 23:42.428
No federal agency wanted it.

23:42.509 --> 23:44.251
Next state agencies had a chance.

23:44.772 --> 23:46.194
We bought it for $214.

23:47.977 --> 23:48.838
We had two people.

23:52.262 --> 23:55.086
Now, that's another story.

23:55.227 --> 24:01.395
The lab developed, but anyhow, Admiral Sherman Whitmore of Galveston was trying to start a maritime academy.

24:01.882 --> 24:03.103
And he walked by our building.

24:03.123 --> 24:04.365
He said, what's in that building?

24:05.446 --> 24:09.510
And he worked through our lab director and to me.

24:09.670 --> 24:16.037
And we arranged that half the building could be turned over for development of Texas Maritime Academy.

24:16.758 --> 24:18.880
I worked with him for a year and a half on this.

24:20.262 --> 24:22.384
And the people of Galveston were very enthused.

24:22.484 --> 24:25.187
They needed some activity of this sort.

24:26.048 --> 24:28.210
And we went to the...

24:28.578 --> 24:31.386
Oh, the various agencies that are interested.

24:31.427 --> 24:35.439
The other maritime academies did not want a new one in the country.

24:36.542 --> 24:42.199
And there was a meeting in Detroit, for example, where we had to wrestle through this.

24:43.411 --> 24:51.981
not a military retired admiral, but a Coast Guard, let's see, I don't know what agency it was, an admiral.

24:52.001 --> 25:00.891
But we finally got that going, and Galveston wanted A&M to be the host institution, the managing institution.

25:00.931 --> 25:07.159
Fine, Tom Harrington was chancellor then, and he appointed me as a university representative.

25:07.639 --> 25:10.903
Okay, I work with the people of Galveston, they got all enthused about this.

25:11.660 --> 25:18.988
And after a year and a half, Dr. Harrington called me in and he says, we got a problem, the legislature.

25:20.029 --> 25:22.252
At that time, it was a big budget crunch.

25:23.313 --> 25:31.683
And the legislature had forced Texas A&M and the University of Texas to agree not to start any new program.

25:33.445 --> 25:37.089
So Dr. Harrington says, you can tell those people we're not gonna be able to do this.

25:38.831 --> 25:39.912
And I had to do that.

25:40.364 --> 25:45.209
And they had really key people of Galveston there at this lunch, and I had to tell them that message.

25:46.811 --> 25:51.315
A&M was not able to start any new program or work with them anymore.

25:51.916 --> 25:56.481
Now this building, this surplus building, was part of old Fort Crockett?

25:56.501 --> 25:57.001
That's correct.

25:57.021 --> 25:57.942
There on the beach?

25:57.962 --> 25:58.623
Yes.

25:58.643 --> 25:59.984
So marvelous location.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.786
Oh, perfect, perfect.

26:01.806 --> 26:06.591
And in your work with Galveston people, you encountered

26:06.773 --> 26:10.840
You had a positive response almost always?

26:11.341 --> 26:12.222
Oh, yeah.

26:12.302 --> 26:15.167
They really, like I said, they needed something like this.

26:15.207 --> 26:16.530
They wanted something like this.

26:17.612 --> 26:20.717
But when I told them I had to pull back, that hurt.

26:20.797 --> 26:23.702
But they had two legislative representatives there.

26:24.223 --> 26:32.477
And those people went after the legislature and got this rule broken or an exemption to it so we could go ahead then with the Maritime Academy.

26:33.132 --> 26:41.647
Now, the purpose of the Maritime Academy was to produce professionals for maritime work.

26:41.667 --> 26:42.789
Service, yes.

26:42.809 --> 26:43.911
Right.

26:43.931 --> 26:48.478
And we need these people at sea.

26:48.979 --> 26:53.487
A lot of our ships are run by foreign registration, foreign crews.

26:54.580 --> 27:01.718
It turns out that the graduates of maritime academies will go to sea a couple of years and then they'll often have office jobs after that in management.

27:01.738 --> 27:06.169
But there was some question of whether we needed another maritime academy.

27:06.370 --> 27:08.455
I think there were four in existence.

27:09.008 --> 27:15.015
But Galveston really wanted it, and they did the political work necessary to allow A&M then to pick up again.

27:15.576 --> 27:29.413
So A&M people, President Rudder and the fiscal officer at the time, I've forgotten his name, took a plane load down to Galveston to inspire this thing and get it going good.

27:29.613 --> 27:30.935
You mentioned this man, Rudder.

27:31.055 --> 27:33.618
He came here about 10 years after you did.

27:33.638 --> 27:38.363
Do you remember any of your early meetings with him?

27:38.443 --> 27:40.265
What was your first impression of Mr. Rudder?

27:41.947 --> 27:45.231
Well, I didn't have many meetings with him, to tell you the truth.

27:45.812 --> 27:58.506
My impression was that here comes an A&M graduate, and Aggies have certain beliefs and ways of operating, and that's probably what's gonna happen in the future.

27:59.718 --> 28:02.821
Was he supportive of the oceanography program?

28:04.964 --> 28:06.445
He really didn't get into it.

28:06.485 --> 28:12.912
He didn't have to very much, although I remember one of his annual talks, he talked about oceanography.

28:14.134 --> 28:20.461
Yeah, even Governor Conley came over here and gave a talk, and he incorporated possibilities of oceanography.

28:22.062 --> 28:29.050
So in the beginning, I didn't have too much contact with Mr. Rudder.

28:30.835 --> 28:34.659
Dr. Harrington moved up from dean to president to chancellor.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.062
So you had an ally there.

28:38.163 --> 28:44.409
And then who followed him as dean?

28:44.469 --> 28:45.050
Do you remember?

28:45.611 --> 28:46.952
No, I can't.

28:46.972 --> 28:47.773
That's embarrassing.

28:47.933 --> 28:51.517
I remember we had an English professor who was very nice as dean.

28:51.677 --> 28:52.838
Oh, John Paul Abbott?

28:52.918 --> 28:53.499
That's the one.

28:53.679 --> 28:54.300
That's the one.

28:54.420 --> 28:55.261
He was very nice.

28:55.902 --> 29:00.066
And then we had the economics professor, Walter.

29:01.852 --> 29:04.595
I can't remember his last name either.

29:05.376 --> 29:06.377
Don't remember that one.

29:07.097 --> 29:18.409
And then Frank Hubert came in 59, and you all remained within arts and sciences until the mid-60s, wasn't it?

29:18.909 --> 29:22.273
64, right, yeah.

29:22.293 --> 29:29.580
Let's talk about how the division came to create a new college.

29:30.067 --> 29:31.349
I remember that in detail.

29:31.669 --> 29:32.110
Please do.

29:32.610 --> 29:36.235
And I've written that up in some notes here and stuff.

29:36.255 --> 29:37.716
Oh boy, that's a difficult one.

29:38.377 --> 29:44.805
When Dean Hubert became dean, his academic work had been the field of education.

29:46.948 --> 29:52.735
He had no experience in any of the sciences or apparently in any of the arts.

29:53.115 --> 29:55.298
He didn't understand research.

29:55.447 --> 29:56.828
at field research as ours.

29:57.989 --> 30:06.978
So for five years, he tried to make our oceanography meteorology department fit the mold, same mold as the history department, physics department, everything.

30:07.438 --> 30:08.900
And we were trying to operate ships.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.481
We had platforms offshore.

30:10.521 --> 30:15.886
We have full graduate programs in meteorology, full graduate programs in oceanography.

30:19.169 --> 30:22.232
Three, let's see, $2 million worth of research projects.

30:22.332 --> 30:25.015
I think we had 23% of all the research

30:25.619 --> 30:27.243
University-wide departments.

30:29.006 --> 30:29.969
23 percent?

30:30.269 --> 30:31.291
I think that's what it was.

30:31.813 --> 30:33.917
I might have to check this.

30:34.098 --> 30:36.563
What were the primary sources of that funding?

30:37.305 --> 30:39.730
Well, the beginning resource was the Navy.

30:40.132 --> 30:43.876
the Hydrographic Office, and then the Office of Naval Research.

30:43.956 --> 30:45.598
And they were steady all the way through.

30:46.299 --> 30:49.562
And then later, the National Science Foundation became a possibility.

30:50.243 --> 30:53.006
And each one of our faculty had different contacts.

30:53.627 --> 30:57.531
The Petroleum, Dr. Jekyll thought the Petroleum Institute would be the big thing.

30:58.031 --> 31:03.237
And he took me around to meet all the, well, we didn't get any money from any of them at the time.

31:03.277 --> 31:07.962
We had an API, I guess that's what it's called, Project, Petroleum Institute Project.

31:08.701 --> 31:11.444
But it was quite a spread of money.

31:12.446 --> 31:16.411
I know we had to write some, over the 15 years, some 400 proposals.

31:17.592 --> 31:30.369
So it's very interesting that if you get a group of projects together and a sympathetic research director, you can shuffle funds back and forth from projects to academics.

31:30.469 --> 31:37.037
And the way we were set up, we could put people on the academic payroll for part-time for a while.

31:37.962 --> 31:42.006
Bob Reed usually had a lot of income himself, and he didn't need his total appointment.

31:42.667 --> 31:48.513
So we had a wide variety of sponsors, and not too many from Texas.

31:48.533 --> 31:53.378
The Dow Chemical Company became one, and I was a consultant to them for a while.

31:55.761 --> 31:57.343
They set up a scholarship.

31:58.684 --> 32:02.949
In the beginning, we got a project with United Gas Pipeline Company.

32:03.449 --> 32:04.290
This came about.
