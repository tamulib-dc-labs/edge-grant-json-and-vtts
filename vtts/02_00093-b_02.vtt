WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:11.771
I can hardly remember his name, and I met the man, and he met a hundred people to see him that night before, and he knew my name and Mario's name.

00:12.452 --> 00:13.334
It was unbelievable.

00:13.374 --> 00:18.161
That's when I started really learning these politicians do have a unique ability.

00:20.885 --> 00:27.034
Were you aware of Mr. Rudder's health problems before his fatal illness?

00:27.194 --> 00:27.895
No.

00:27.875 --> 00:30.160
That was a jolt.

00:30.260 --> 00:30.961
Same for me.

00:31.081 --> 00:32.344
I was not aware either.

00:33.727 --> 00:35.350
Have you run across anyone who did?

00:35.370 --> 00:41.582
A couple of people that saw him day to day were aware that he was gaining weight.

00:41.602 --> 00:43.065
That's all I'd have heard of.

00:43.166 --> 00:46.913
And that he was losing some of his energy.

00:46.893 --> 00:49.996
that he would wear down quicker, but I was not.

00:50.176 --> 00:54.800
Now, Lindsey was a very close friend of his, if I'm not wrong and recall.

00:55.241 --> 00:56.802
I wonder if he did know anything.

00:56.822 --> 00:57.583
Have you talked to him?

00:57.983 --> 00:58.303
Oh, yes.

00:58.503 --> 01:01.987
I've gotten one, but I want to do some more interviews with John.

01:03.548 --> 01:16.900
Who were the former students that were most â€“ if you were identifying some former students who were most supportive of what you saw happening in economics, who would they be?

01:16.880 --> 01:23.659
Well this one fellow who Al Chalk had mesmerized, and I mean mesmerized, a fellow who worshiped Al.

01:24.341 --> 01:26.086
Al had to be one tremendous teacher.

01:27.229 --> 01:32.323
I can't recall his name, darn it, but he's in Houston, lives in Houston.

01:34.092 --> 01:38.766
I'll try to recall and call your secretary and give you... Not Hal Booty, not Lindsay.

01:39.127 --> 01:39.648
No, no.

01:40.511 --> 01:43.760
Not Les Appelt, not Appelt.

01:43.961 --> 01:48.253
Appelt was one, and there was also this fellow up in Waco.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.439
who became a politician.

01:51.799 --> 01:54.543
Gee, I wish I'd brought Maury with me.

01:54.924 --> 01:56.446
She's so good on these things.

01:56.546 --> 01:57.427
Well, we'll get that later.

01:58.569 --> 02:03.616
Yeah, maybe when we get you up in Rockwall, try to remember these things that I'm blanking out on.

02:03.916 --> 02:04.277
Okay.

02:05.839 --> 02:06.259
Let's see.

02:07.842 --> 02:08.903
Bill Moore.

02:09.364 --> 02:12.729
Oh, Bill Moore was fantastic.

02:12.749 --> 02:13.990
Can I give you a story on that one?

02:14.091 --> 02:15.152
Oh, yes, please do.

02:17.107 --> 02:18.568
I tried to recruit Bill Fouts.

02:18.588 --> 02:25.535
Remember I mentioned this fellow who I met, Charlie Ferguson, and Charlie was Bill's favorite Ph.D.

02:25.575 --> 02:25.995
candidate.

02:26.636 --> 02:33.903
Well Bill was one of my favorite colleagues, indirect colleague, friends in the profession shall I say.

02:34.563 --> 02:44.532
So I finally got Bill Fouts down here for a big party in his honor, trying to tell Bill it's time for you to leave North Carolina.

02:44.552 --> 02:46.354
You've been there for half of a century.

02:46.621 --> 02:51.970
come here to A&M and be happy, and really find a great department in university.

02:52.751 --> 03:01.947
So I had Bill Fouts here, and we're negotiating, and I said everything Bill said he wanted, I said, I'll match it, I'll match that.

03:02.112 --> 03:03.373
I didn't ask him what he was getting.

03:03.553 --> 03:13.564
I just knew what the name of the game was in academia, what the salaries were, what a person like Bill, to me, would be worth at Stanford or elsewhere.

03:14.545 --> 03:21.932
And everything Bill asked for was, gee whiz, if anything, less than I thought I would be willing to go myself.

03:23.514 --> 03:25.295
And I'm not running the department now.

03:25.315 --> 03:26.517
I don't believe it this time.

03:26.557 --> 03:31.782
I think I'd already been turned over to John Allen at this particular occasion.

03:33.567 --> 03:38.293
But in any event, oh God, I've got another story with R.C.

03:38.333 --> 03:39.295
Slocum, because R.C.

03:39.335 --> 03:40.757
Slocum was a coach then.

03:40.777 --> 03:48.968
So this is back in the late 70s at least.

03:48.988 --> 03:54.815
But anyway, so Bill Fouts is here, and finally we ran into the one stumbling block.

03:55.416 --> 04:00.583
He asked about retirement in the state of Texas, and I told him.

04:00.603 --> 04:02.005
He said, well, that's absurd.

04:02.930 --> 04:08.535
He said, Mill, don't you realize what we get in retirement in North Carolina?

04:08.555 --> 04:11.838
And he said, and I know Virginia and other states.

04:12.338 --> 04:15.261
What you guys have down there is pathetic.

04:17.483 --> 04:19.705
I said, well, you know, I really hadn't worried about it.

04:20.105 --> 04:32.937
I did make a deal with Murray that I'd be stuck on TRS instead of ORP, but I didn't let that be of real importance to me personally.

04:33.507 --> 04:39.334
So I decided, well I'm going to check on this thing because I'm not even having a chance for Bill Fouts because of retirement.

04:41.496 --> 04:52.329
I had a student, Bob Gillespie, Lynn Gillespie, we had two PhD candidates in the department.

04:52.830 --> 04:56.835
One was my assistant, Lynn, I think.

04:57.235 --> 04:58.757
I said, Lynn, I've got a job for you.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.181
I want you to go ahead and write to

05:03.460 --> 05:09.799
49 other states in the country and learn their retirement policies for academicians.

05:13.951 --> 05:16.137
I said, when you draft your letter,

05:16.488 --> 05:33.209
give it to me, I'll edit it and make sure I like what you're doing and when you get the information tabulate it and give it to me and let me know how you're doing and do it full speed, quickly."

05:33.229 --> 05:36.313
Well within about a month he gives his report to me.

05:37.375 --> 05:38.476
I was flabbergasted.

05:38.756 --> 05:43.963
There was only one state worse than the state of Texas, namely Mississippi.

05:45.901 --> 05:55.654
I went immediately to visit Bill Presnell and Bill Moore.

05:56.075 --> 06:10.474
I met with each separately, gave them a copy of the report, and I said, and this is when Phil Graham was running for Congress, by the way, because I then went to Auburn to give some lectures.

06:14.521 --> 06:22.748
I showed Bill Moore and Bill Pesnell, and also mentioned this to Bill Clayton one of those evenings that I landed up with him.

06:24.530 --> 06:28.654
I showed them the report that Mississippi was worse than Texas.

06:28.914 --> 06:41.686
The mighty state of Texas was the next worst in the country, and we weren't even close to some of the good states because we were limiting retirement funds on something like that $25,000 level.

06:41.786 --> 06:43.127
Remember that, Haskell?

06:43.900 --> 06:49.847
And I said, isn't this criminal to lose faculty because we are on the level of Mississippi?

06:51.749 --> 06:57.776
Several months later, I'm at Auburn giving lectures, and I received a phone call.

06:57.876 --> 07:01.820
This is obviously then in November, election time.

07:02.361 --> 07:03.602
I received a phone call.

07:04.724 --> 07:05.384
Guess what?

07:05.685 --> 07:08.608
Phil Graham was elected, but I've got better news for you, Mel.

07:09.331 --> 07:15.566
They have not only changed the retirement laws in the state of Texas, they made it retroactive as of a few years earlier.

07:15.626 --> 07:24.066
So for the fellow who retired a few years earlier and maybe was making $33,000, his retirement was based on $33,000.

07:24.586 --> 07:27.370
Bill Moore was then the head of the Senate.

07:27.890 --> 07:31.115
What did we call that fellow, the Speaker of the House?

07:31.215 --> 07:34.459
No, he was the Chairman of the State Affairs Committee.

07:34.639 --> 07:37.323
Well, bless you for knowing that.

07:37.503 --> 07:39.886
And President Pro Tem of the Senate.

07:39.926 --> 07:40.167
Yes.

07:41.408 --> 07:47.877
Anyway, he and Bill Pesnell wheeled and deal that through within a handful of months

07:48.565 --> 07:53.032
And change of law so that now our retirement laws are respectable.

07:53.513 --> 07:58.942
I don't think that they're even top flight yet compared to some things I've heard, but they're pretty darn good.

07:59.042 --> 08:00.064
I've got no complaint.

08:00.925 --> 08:02.228
But that's how that came about.

08:02.248 --> 08:03.550
All right, Nate.

08:03.570 --> 08:09.139
You stepped aside as department head in 69.

08:09.119 --> 08:12.023
But continued on the faculty for how much longer?

08:12.384 --> 08:16.289
Until 1992 active and then I went emeritus.

08:16.990 --> 08:22.759
During those years then, you saw the department continue to grow.

08:24.201 --> 08:28.948
You continued to write and do research.

08:28.968 --> 08:30.570
During all those years,

08:30.989 --> 08:36.427
What were your primary areas of academic emphasis in your own work?

08:36.828 --> 08:38.533
What were you working on most diligently?

08:38.694 --> 08:40.881
Well, what is called spatial microeconomics.

08:42.076 --> 08:54.235
And it adds distance to time, something the economist had not done, and that was based on August Lerch and location economics of his, the spatial ordering of production.

08:55.477 --> 09:02.849
And who else in the world are the other leading scholars in that specialty?

09:02.869 --> 09:04.331
Oh, now there are quite a number.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.835
George Norman, a friend of mine out of...

09:07.456 --> 09:13.962
Actually, he's a Scotsman who used to be at the University of Leicester and is now at Amherst.

09:14.422 --> 09:17.685
And that's Leicester, L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.808
L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R, that's right.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.551
And took his PhD out of Oxford.

09:24.371 --> 09:30.397
A fellow named Jacques Thisse, I think they call him, but it's T-H-I-S-S-E.

09:31.077 --> 09:32.959
He's out of Belgium.

09:32.979 --> 09:37.243
A fellow named Louis Flips, who's a Frenchman down in...

09:37.223 --> 09:41.969
In Italy right now, at least the last I heard, he was down there.

09:41.989 --> 09:49.398
A fellow named Martin Beckman, who goes back and forth from Bonn and Brown, oddly enough.

09:49.418 --> 09:52.863
It almost sounds contradictory, Bonn and Brown.

09:53.844 --> 09:58.970
And a lot of people in the Orient who have been in this field.

09:59.050 --> 10:05.138
One of them was a student of mine, Hiroshi Oda, who was recommended to

10:05.607 --> 10:16.276
study under me at A&M by a man who translated my plant location book, which was my old dissertation, upgraded a little bit.

10:17.397 --> 10:29.147
Can you summarize the central points in this specialty that I as a layman or anyone in the future could understand?

10:32.871 --> 10:34.672
Let me generalize beyond that a little bit.

10:34.692 --> 10:35.513
Okay, please do.

10:37.400 --> 10:41.465
I don't know if you would be interested in this, this may almost be tangential.

10:42.266 --> 10:55.360
My current interest in life, now that I cannot play golf, tennis, I'm here well, there for a lecture and so forth, is to write a book which I am doing with a son of mine, Science and God.

10:57.082 --> 11:01.247
I'm tired of people thinking that academicians are a bunch of liberal

11:02.898 --> 11:08.425
I'm personally tired of that event that happened to me in Florida State.

11:09.566 --> 11:14.733
You're the only major professor in our whole college who wanted Goldwater.

11:15.394 --> 11:29.732
That doesn't sound like an eclectic university, and of course it was a good one, but this is just a reflection even among academicians that we're all politically correct and so forth and so on.

11:30.100 --> 11:33.203
I don't buy any of this modern day bills, frankly.

11:33.223 --> 11:41.492
I am an old-fashioned conservative who's now found Phil Graham somewhat disappointing in some ways.

11:43.094 --> 11:57.289
Anyway, what I'm doing in this book is demonstrating that cosmologists, physicists, chemists, and mathematicians, philosophers in general, are not

11:58.315 --> 11:59.537
what most people think.

12:00.518 --> 12:10.293
There is Stephen Hawking and his group, you've heard of Stephen Hawking, who claims that what we have here on Earth is not created by God, it's all accidental.

12:13.057 --> 12:13.878
What's accidental?

12:14.119 --> 12:26.517
Well, the nuclear strong force, the nuclear weak force, the electromagnetism, gravity, the relationship in mass between the proton and the electron, and especially the proton and the neutron, ad infinitum.

12:27.931 --> 12:28.732
It's all accident.

12:28.993 --> 12:39.248
In fact, Hawking goes on to say, and do you mind if I get out my little soapbox again, Haskell, because it does tie in with spatial microeconomics.

12:40.610 --> 12:47.020
Hawking would say that in his world there are multiple universes well beyond that which we even know exist.

12:47.506 --> 12:50.690
Because all we can know is what our light years are telling us.

12:50.730 --> 12:56.037
For example, it takes 76 years for a round-trap signal from here to Arcturus and back.

12:56.418 --> 13:09.615
Well, there are ranges way beyond that of our greatest receipts of light that conceivably there are other universes besides those that we don't even know of within our own spectrum of light.

13:10.439 --> 13:25.562
And as a result, in any one of these universes, Hawking and his fellow cosmologists would say, there could be some planet just like ours with all of these unbelievable parameters, physically speaking, in which

13:25.542 --> 13:31.169
There are a bunch of monkeys living because they've got water, they've got all the things that we have on Earth.

13:31.489 --> 13:32.750
They don't have to look like us.

13:32.790 --> 13:33.972
They could be pure monkeys.

13:34.592 --> 13:46.186
And on these planets in the infinite space and time, some monkey could be typing tools that even the Bard of England, Shakespeare, would say, gosh, it's much better than anything I ever did.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.710
And it's pure accident, according to Hawking.

13:51.209 --> 14:00.401
A fellow named Brandon Carter back in the 70s, a physicist said, and he set up the Anthropic Principle, in which he said, boy, this is amazing.

14:00.962 --> 14:10.254
The world that we've got here on Earth alone that we do know of, we're not talking about worlds we don't know exist or might exist, but what we've got is unbelievable.

14:10.995 --> 14:15.520
It is so unbelievable that why not believe in God?

14:15.580 --> 14:19.866
Because, by gosh, what made all of these things combine and fine-tune?

14:19.998 --> 14:21.962
and we are in a fine-tuned world.

14:22.523 --> 14:27.151
The only trouble with all of that is we're talking only about our physical universe.

14:27.952 --> 14:31.238
Well in economics we've got a fine-tuned universe here.

14:31.298 --> 14:44.622
For example, in general equilibrium theory we could set up an infinite number almost of equations, all of which will yield at any given point in time a unique equilibrium.

14:44.939 --> 14:52.769
Leontief, one of the pioneers of matrix algebra in the use in economics, set up the input-output tables.

14:52.849 --> 14:55.312
I'm sure you've heard of and remembered even.

14:56.313 --> 15:05.845
These input-output tables, I know after World War II, the Pentagon was subsidizing so that we could pick out the optimal target in the Soviet Union.

15:06.846 --> 15:09.850
For a bombing run, should we go into war with them?

15:10.100 --> 15:12.603
And what did this input-output table involve?

15:13.063 --> 15:22.873
A whole batch of simultaneous equations with a unique solution which would show us which target might give us the greatest destruction of all possible.

15:23.413 --> 15:26.517
And it is not necessarily the one that looks like the best target.

15:26.537 --> 15:39.870
It might be one that just slips through with all of these other industries and destroys so many things that we cannot visualize without the knowledge that we have and the information that we have got to acquire.

15:40.475 --> 15:48.424
So in the world of economics now, we've got a whole bunch of equations, a whole bunch of those, a whole bunch of columns.

15:48.484 --> 15:50.026
We've got a matrix in other words.

15:50.086 --> 15:59.778
We can invert it easily on a computer and almost any mathematician, any economist can invert the matrix and come up with the unique solutions.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.103
How did we get a world like this in economics?

16:04.538 --> 16:07.348
It's fine-tuned just like the cosmologists tell me.

16:07.389 --> 16:14.515
The nuclear strong force is fine-tuned because it allows protons and neutrons to come together and even

16:15.997 --> 16:20.724
even many protons which otherwise would repulse each other because of their positive charge.

16:21.505 --> 16:28.034
And they come together because of the strong force, the binding energy in effect as a physicist would say, and et cetera.

16:28.575 --> 16:35.144
Well in economics we have almost the same world and that's what my son and I are trying to demonstrate.

16:35.284 --> 16:44.417
We are both talking about and just to provide the fundamental simplicity on this thing,

16:46.034 --> 16:59.513
Way, way back, several centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ, we had a group of philosophers called the atomists, A-T-O-M-I-S-T-S, as you know, Haskell.

17:00.094 --> 17:06.683
These atomists conceived of the atom that no one yet today, to this point in time, has ever been able to see directly.

17:07.204 --> 17:14.775
We know it exists because we've got so many experiments going on and so many ways of proving it by radium and half-lives and all of that.

17:15.515 --> 17:20.323
We know the atom exists, but how did they know this when those people were so doggone dumb?

17:20.743 --> 17:21.805
They didn't go to Harvard.

17:21.825 --> 17:22.927
They didn't go to Oxford.

17:22.967 --> 17:27.854
They didn't even know of Plato and Aristotle who came centuries after them.

17:29.657 --> 17:41.556
To me, the world that I'm living in, maybe because I'm becoming an old character, real old character, is so unbelievable, so amazing, and the human mind has been so amazing.

17:42.143 --> 17:52.497
The knowledge that, especially these physical scientists, more so than I think you and I in our fields, I'd like to believe that we do pretty solid work.

17:52.517 --> 18:05.434
But to me, whenever I learn that, gee whiz, not only is the atom formed by protons, neutrons, electrons, but then they start talking about neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and

18:06.663 --> 18:16.646
Ad infinitum, last I had a count with it, more than 20 sub-particles in the atom that no one yet can see because the atom itself is too small.

18:17.649 --> 18:22.039
And yet we know all about these things, the meson, the muon, what have you.

18:23.673 --> 18:26.381
What the physical scientist has done I think is unbelievable.

18:26.782 --> 18:29.991
I'd like to say what we've done in economics is pretty doggone good.

18:30.011 --> 18:38.695
And I see the same fine-tuned world in economics to say nothing other than the fact that in almost any home here they're gonna have eggs on them.

18:39.738 --> 18:41.380
table for breakfast tomorrow.

18:41.661 --> 18:46.047
How do we get everything so uniquely fine-tuned and combined?

18:47.349 --> 18:49.532
To me, it is just outstanding.

18:49.832 --> 18:59.806
Spatial microeconomics did to economics, or does to economics, what real outer space has been doing to physicists and cosmologists.

18:59.826 --> 19:01.448
It's giving us another dimension.

19:01.468 --> 19:09.019
Actually, in economics, we have basically the simplistic three-space world.

19:09.995 --> 19:16.843
In a sense, we did not include, let me put it more simply, we did not include distances.

19:18.025 --> 19:25.774
We imagine in effect what it boiled down to if you ever wanted to trace the philosophical roots of most of our theories like pure competition.

19:26.795 --> 19:31.141
We in effect are assuming that all buying is at a point, which is ridiculous.

19:31.161 --> 19:35.005
You spread people out over space and you don't have the purely competitive market.

19:35.386 --> 19:37.909
You have a world of oligopoly and oligopsony.

19:38.682 --> 19:46.851
and that means big business rather than a bunch of robots as was imagined in effect by classical economics.

19:46.871 --> 20:06.613
So all Spatial Micro is doing is just adding another problem, the problem of time plus distance, so that we have to include the fact that one seller is differentiated from another not only by his product but by his location, his space, and it just added a

20:07.387 --> 20:12.091
a little complication to the equations that we call our general equilibrium system.

20:12.932 --> 20:20.439
So when we have an equation, for example, to describe our economy, we have to adjust the equation.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.801
May I put it very bluntly?

20:23.042 --> 20:25.724
There is no such thing as a demand curve.

20:25.744 --> 20:26.725
Now who knows that?

20:28.267 --> 20:33.551
Every student on this campus who's taking a course right now in economics would say, now the demand curve is such and such.

20:34.092 --> 20:35.233
Frankly, it doesn't exist.

20:36.749 --> 20:46.050
But if that sounds shocking, the supply curve really doesn't exist the way it's drawn, and in the field of electrics.

20:47.195 --> 20:50.380
Faraday, fields of electrical force.

20:50.781 --> 20:51.462
They don't exist.

20:51.482 --> 20:53.025
He said this is all imaginary.

20:53.726 --> 21:00.177
We imagine things in the world of our minds, including the demand curve and the supply curve that everyone talks about glibly.

21:00.697 --> 21:03.162
It doesn't exist, yet we do it, we use it.

21:03.622 --> 21:05.405
But if we know what we're doing, it's fine.

21:05.546 --> 21:09.532
If we don't know what we're doing, well, then we can make a lot of mistakes.

21:09.712 --> 21:12.477
And politicians, frankly, oftentimes will take

21:12.457 --> 21:19.671
simplistics and make mistakes, but my ultimate point is the world we've got is so darn fine-tuned, so unbelievable.

21:20.533 --> 21:25.943
The older I get, the more I have a chance to learn what chemists have been doing and what have you.

21:26.581 --> 21:31.070
the more I am amazed that the human mind itself cannot be an accident.

21:31.851 --> 21:44.556
The fact that monkeys might type elsewhere would be an accident, I would imagine, but the fact that we are here, and we also have a fine-tuned economic universe, and frankly, I hope someday

21:44.536 --> 21:53.585
that if this book ever does come out and it's being written for the layman, because I'm not pretending to be able to really write physics and chemistry, nor is my son.

21:53.845 --> 21:55.447
We all have chapters.

21:55.487 --> 21:57.049
I'll give you an outline of it in a minute.

21:57.789 --> 22:06.638
We are writing chapters on such things as physics and chemistry, cosmology, relativity, theory, et cetera.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.340
I was talking to Al Cotton earlier today.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.083
I thought Al would say, hey Mel, you're being pretentious.

22:11.789 --> 22:14.553
He said, no, I agree with what you're saying and what I was saying.

22:14.894 --> 22:24.108
Sometimes you don't have to be, in fact, one of the worst things you could do is be a real expert and try to write for others to understand other than if you're writing for experts.

22:24.729 --> 22:29.136
If you're writing for experts on their level, then you're pushing the frontiers of science.

22:29.156 --> 22:34.084
And no way can I push the frontiers of anything, even economics anymore.

22:34.722 --> 22:45.390
But I could sure write to a layman and explain how unbelievable chemistry is, how unbelievable physics is, how unbelievable relativity theory is, and what it boils down to.

22:46.012 --> 22:59.548
And the hardest part of what John and I are doing, because John was a mathematician at A&M, took his bachelor's in math, and then there's econometrics, ECMT, via Bob Baseman here.

23:01.070 --> 23:06.897
He and I, our trouble is with economics, because we want to go beyond ourselves.

23:06.937 --> 23:10.421
We want to push the frontiers back, and that's not possible.

23:10.941 --> 23:15.867
And then when we don't, we think of, gee, this sentence really is not correct.

23:15.847 --> 23:20.317
But it's good enough, and it's hard to say it's good enough when you know it's not correct.

23:22.262 --> 23:26.692
That's what makes, from my standpoint, it relatively easy to be writing about relativity theory.

23:27.233 --> 23:33.788
I can't write about relativity theory the way a real physicist could or a man who's knowledgeable.

23:33.970 --> 23:45.419
and trained in it, but I could write about relativity theory so that presumably my wife, if she wanted to read it, she would find my description easier than anything she could read from an Albert Einstein.

23:45.579 --> 23:50.832
How could he ever write about it than anyone else could read but a great scholar in his area?

23:51.250 --> 23:59.060
As you are getting established as a scholar in economics, what was your first, I'll call it, keystone publication?

23:59.500 --> 24:03.786
What was the title or the topic?

24:04.206 --> 24:05.267
Do you know what I actually did?

24:05.868 --> 24:10.113
I wrote a dissertation on location in the state in Alabama.

24:10.554 --> 24:10.874
Why?

24:10.914 --> 24:19.485
My department head said, Mel, you move into the South, write a dissertation about the South,

24:20.073 --> 24:23.378
and pick your subject, but do something.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.741
Industry is moving to the south," he said.

24:26.242 --> 24:27.543
Write something along that line.

24:28.445 --> 24:37.096
So I learned in the Army, if you're not ready to go and say bad things to others, and if they count, you better do it their way.

24:37.357 --> 24:41.102
So I decided, well, I'll light it on industry in the south.

24:41.960 --> 24:51.170
And I was then with our church, with that German student, reading the spatial ordering of the economy in German.

24:51.870 --> 24:54.813
So I'll go on industrial location in Alabama.

24:55.094 --> 25:02.181
So I wrote my dissertation, which was essentially a rehashing of all of the literature on location economics up until that point in time.

25:02.722 --> 25:10.650
And I threw in some industry studies based on interviews in the state of Alabama of why did you locate here and all of that sort of thing.

25:11.356 --> 25:19.810
But the real guts of my interest was becoming August Lerch's, breaking up of the Soviet Union in the most efficient world.

25:19.830 --> 25:26.101
But I didn't want to include that in my dissertation because I would open up a Pandora's box during my oral exam.

25:26.802 --> 25:32.892
I just wanted a nice, easy, simplistic oral exam with a nice, easy, simplistic dissertation.

25:33.547 --> 25:43.661
So, when I finished that dissertation and got the doctorate, then I started revising it by adding August Lurch, really, into that book.

25:44.422 --> 25:55.757
And tried to, as I mentioned, these articles that I'd sent to a journal that was headed by a German economist, and who just grabbed my articles.

25:56.037 --> 25:58.120
And these articles I threw into this book.

25:58.943 --> 26:02.949
And that book came out and was called Plant Location in Theory and in Practice.

26:03.370 --> 26:07.977
Not Industrial Location in Alabama, but Plant Location in Theory and in Practice.

26:08.878 --> 26:11.582
And it was the first book in the English language since 1936.

26:11.602 --> 26:21.036
And this book came out around 1951, no, 55 rather, excuse me.

26:21.978 --> 26:23.963
And it was the first book in English.

26:24.043 --> 26:34.968
Within a year, two other books appeared on the same general subject, not duplicates in any form, quite dissimilar, but yet still the same basic subject.

26:34.989 --> 26:37.354
So here was a subject that was long overdue.

26:37.891 --> 26:51.201
And I lucked into it because of that German student and the fact that my department head back at Washington University said, write on the South location, industry, something, anything else, find a good subject for yourself.

26:52.123 --> 26:55.410
And I lucked into that subject and revised it, came out with a book.

26:55.998 --> 27:03.147
About two years later, it was translated into Japanese by this man who ultimately sent Oda into A&M to study under me.

27:04.249 --> 27:14.642
And it went in three volumes, and the Japanese and others in the Orient jumped on the bandwagon fairly quickly, and of course, in the United States and England.

27:15.523 --> 27:19.969
What was your next significant publication?

27:21.972 --> 27:23.794
We're talking about mountain peaks now.

27:25.343 --> 27:27.170
Well, a whole bunch of academic articles.

27:27.230 --> 27:36.906
I've put in over a hundred, and I kept wanting more realism in economics, less of this

27:38.303 --> 27:40.525
imagining simplistic worlds.

27:41.086 --> 27:46.752
Let's get down into the brass tacks of the world that we're living in, which of course is economic space.

27:46.772 --> 27:59.785
How can we talk about an economy without even including in one of our fundamental parameters the fact that people are located differentially over space, and that firms compete differently over their spaces.

27:59.865 --> 28:02.868
Some of them invade, for example, on predatory pricing.

28:03.869 --> 28:07.753
The typical clichÃ© still followed by

28:08.138 --> 28:12.684
politicians, shall I say, is the fairest pricing is not to discriminate.

28:13.124 --> 28:14.606
Well, what do they mean by discriminate?

28:15.066 --> 28:32.728
Well, they mean if, for example, I am located at A and I'm going to sell over in D and the cost of transportation from A to D is X, then I add X to my basic price at A and at D I'm charging my basic price plus X and that is

28:33.029 --> 28:38.555
linear pricing, linear in terms of cost of distance, and it is non-predatory.

28:39.155 --> 28:44.621
Well, my son and I, I think John was with me on this article, maybe it was someone else.

28:46.222 --> 28:59.155
John and I had this one on predatory pricing indicating that it could be a very natural phenomenon for the firm at A to price way below even its own price here

28:59.540 --> 29:09.792
at D if it wants to compete and sell and if it can profit maximize without being in the position of trying to destroy the competitor.

29:09.813 --> 29:16.381
It depends on, in other words, a whole conglomerate of forces that otherwise are lost sight of.

29:16.681 --> 29:27.454
So one of the worst things that we do in the world of politics is we glibly accept what looks to be very right, such as you add X to A and you have your price at D,

29:27.704 --> 29:30.912
but maybe the X is an illegitimate addition.

29:31.553 --> 29:46.388
Maybe in terms of the levels of competition, maybe in terms of the demand curve, the type of demand curve, mind you, I say it doesn't exist, but we can imagine a type of demand curve just like Faraday imagines his fields of electrical force.

29:46.823 --> 29:50.428
And it helps us, we humans who don't know too doggone much.

29:51.049 --> 29:53.653
It helps us come up with reasonable decisions.

29:54.314 --> 29:59.922
And if we cannot come up with a decision which we agree is reasonable, let's not even try it.

30:00.123 --> 30:02.206
Let's not try to mess with the economy.

30:02.726 --> 30:05.290
And that's what I think makes me a conservative.

30:05.851 --> 30:09.476
If I mess with the economy, I want to say to myself, I know exactly what I'm doing.

30:10.498 --> 30:15.345
And there are so many things we don't know exactly, especially in the world of the social sciences.

30:15.950 --> 30:45.535
And by gosh, I'm pretty sure any good chemists and physicists, in fact, Albert Carton and I talking earlier today, he was saying one difference between he and me is that I could leave my profession because I couldn't hear well and hence found teaching as a task that I didn't feel like I was up to anymore, that I would be a pretender trying to talk to kids and not let them ask me questions because I couldn't hear them.

30:46.088 --> 30:47.873
I thought, that's not the way to be a professor.

30:48.655 --> 30:51.262
So, therefore, I decided I'm going to retire.

30:51.583 --> 30:52.385
I'm emeritus.

30:53.127 --> 30:59.203
I doubt that the university would have ever fired me because, if anything, I was on the way up professionally all these years.

30:59.943 --> 31:03.749
And I had tenure, and there's no one who could challenge my confidence.

31:04.470 --> 31:07.935
But I fell embarrassed and decided to retire.

31:07.975 --> 31:14.265
And on top of that, I decided I'd better leave this environment because I can't get away from my office.

31:14.505 --> 31:16.649
While I lived here, I'm just so used to it.

31:17.670 --> 31:18.972
So I'm going up to Rockwell.

31:18.992 --> 31:20.495
I'm going to play tennis, play golf.

31:20.575 --> 31:23.259
Unfortunately, physically, that became impossible.

31:23.920 --> 31:27.165
So I landed up doing this sort of thing that I'm talking about.
