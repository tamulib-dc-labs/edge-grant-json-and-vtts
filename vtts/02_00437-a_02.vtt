WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:03.960
You and General Dean stayed with the plane. 
Actually, it's funny to talk about these things.

00:08.265 --> 00:10.628
And it's interesting, I think. It's fascinating.

00:15.854 --> 00:19.738
This is common, ordinary things that happen in a 
relation between nations. That's the reason to me

00:19.858 --> 00:24.503
that they're so meaningful looking back now. And 
in this particular case, I got to talk and live and

00:24.736 --> 00:30.664
eat and get drunk with almost. I was still a fine 
ambassador. I couldn't get drunk, but I had a lot of

00:32.467 --> 00:39.537
vodka that evening with the commander of a Red Air 
Force fighter squadron. No telling how many guys,

00:39.717 --> 00:43.222
Germans, this guy had to his credit. And through 
the interpreter sitting right between us, the

00:43.743 --> 00:49.551
interpreter for the ambassador, this Navy 
lieutenant. And by the way, he had time for his

00:50.132 --> 00:52.195
life, too. He didn't have flies, so he could drink. 
But he would interpret. And we talked like an Air

00:57.093 --> 01:01.077
Force man to another Air Force man. There was no 
problem whatsoever. So they took you into town.

01:04.220 --> 01:11.428
Yeah, took us into town and put us up in a dormitory 
that was fortunately still standing. Part of it

01:11.528 --> 01:13.110
had been blown to pieces. Every place was almost 
just cleared to the ground, razed to the ground,

01:13.130 --> 01:19.617
demolished. How about the people? Very few people 
I saw. I don't know where they were. I guess they

01:23.750 --> 01:24.992
were living in the ground. Even they had the P-39s 
around the field on alert. They had them backed off

01:30.559 --> 01:36.468
into sort of a dugout ramp, like you would have put a 
tank. Sure. They'd roll them down to at least get

01:37.569 --> 01:45.861
them with the wall levees around them, you know. A 
gun emplacement-like thing is what they had them

01:45.881 --> 01:48.945
parked in. And they still expected German attacks 
from them. Sure. They worried about us being

01:52.451 --> 01:53.913
there. There might be a German attack on us. And 
rightfully concerned about the Ambassador to the

01:56.035 --> 02:00.840
United States. But I had conversations with the 
squad. They gave us a deal. So that evening, all of

02:03.502 --> 02:08.327
you went, everybody on the plane went to dinner. 
Yeah. General Dean ended up finally took him over

02:08.968 --> 02:12.071
to where the Ambassador was staying. I don't know 
where it was. But my crew and me and the

02:13.372 --> 02:18.898
Ambassador's interpreter were somehow or 
another, he stayed with us. And through him, and

02:19.216 --> 02:29.045
actually I was talking with this

02:19.216 --> 02:29.045
Red Air Force pilot, fighter pilot. And typical, 
typical American fighter pilot. Typical. You

02:33.690 --> 02:35.512
mean he was like an American? Except for his 
language and his uniform, I would have thought I

02:36.052 --> 02:40.196
was talking to another American fighter pilot. No 
kidding. And even, you know, after two drinks, oh,

02:41.518 --> 02:48.244
he says, when we take care of the Germans, he said, 
don't worry, don't worry, we're going to take care

02:41.518 --> 02:48.244
of the Japanese. No problem. Don't worry. When we 
get to the Germans, and they kaput soon, and then

02:50.542 --> 02:56.708
that kaput Japan. What about, did you swap some 
stories about the flying tigers? Oh, yeah. Had he

03:03.455 --> 03:04.796
heard of the flying tigers? Yes, since you brought 
it up, I think he had heard about this. He had no

03:09.240 --> 03:11.343
respect for Japanese whatsoever. He thought it 
would be simple. No respect. It must have been easy

03:15.066 --> 03:17.809
over there, something like that, you know. But he 
and I just got along great. And I gave him my Zippo

03:21.740 --> 03:33.074
cigarette lighter and I think he gave me a little 
tiny ivory bone, I guess, type cigarette lighter.

03:33.094 --> 03:33.996
It didn't even work. We changed that as gifts to one 
another. Was he a colonel?

03:42.086 --> 03:42.547
No. I don't remember what his rank was. He couldn't 
have been over a major rank. But he was a squadron

03:47.877 --> 03:49.839
commander. And very young, very young, but a lot of 
combat experience, no doubt. And cocky, typical,

03:56.024 --> 03:59.267
typical fighter pilot. A tiger, if you will. And 
the next morning, of course then we went to bed, the

04:01.209 --> 04:08.516
next morning we got up, and for breakfast we had raw 
fish and vodka. Raw fish and vodka. And you had to

04:12.039 --> 04:16.163
chew on it a little to be courteous because the 
Russians, you know that old fighter pilot sat

04:16.396 --> 04:21.103
right next to me, just gobbling it up, and toasting 
me in vodka. You know, I had to, I felt free to tell

04:21.123 --> 04:29.316
him, look, I've got to fly the airplane, but I'll 
sip it with you.

04:31.099 --> 04:34.645
And most cordial, most cordial. No problem 
whatsoever, you know. Then you think back to the

04:37.168 --> 04:43.939
problem we're having in Russia now, compared to 
our discussion there with a Red Air Force fighter

04:37.168 --> 04:43.939
pilot.

04:47.902 --> 04:48.863
But that's the story. Isn't that incredible? Let 
me, the airplane picks the problem. But did you,

04:53.409 --> 05:02.941
because of this conversation with this fighter 
pilot, did you have different, did you come to

04:53.409 --> 05:02.941
different thoughts about the average Russian? 
No, as a matter of fact, it's been firm. I can't talk

05:07.046 --> 05:13.154
about the man on the street, on the lower strata of 
people, when you sit down and talk, communicate.

05:14.316 --> 05:15.377
Many times, in subsequent meetings with the Red 
Air Force who was supporting us at the shuttle

05:16.015 --> 05:25.967
bases, you know, staying there overnight on many 
meetings with them and talking to them. It was this

05:25.987 --> 05:29.090
same type of camaraderie, no problem whatsoever.

05:32.715 --> 05:34.877
Just very close feelings. To me, I felt closer to 
them than I would if I'd talked to a ramp pilot or air

05:35.558 --> 05:40.804
pilot. No kidding? Oh, yeah. Just like a 
typical... Matter of fact, I liked them. And

05:46.677 --> 05:48.179
utmost confidence. I was sure that guy could take 
on any German fighter pilot and whip him any day.

05:53.045 --> 05:55.488
That's how I felt about it. So you had a high regard 
then for the military man in the Russian Air Force.

06:02.417 --> 06:08.644
Like I say, it would be a terrible, terrible 
conflict.

06:08.664 --> 06:12.029
But, you know, those boys are gone now. They're 
like me. They're 16, 17, retired. Many of them are

06:14.452 --> 06:16.414
dead. Russia hasn't been fighting a war like we 
have, so I don't know how combat experience they

06:17.288 --> 06:27.941
have, how much they have in their current forces. I 
see evidence of it in pictures, but how much of it is

06:27.961 --> 06:31.065
propaganda? Did you leave the next morning then? 
Yeah, took off the next morning and went on down to

06:32.868 --> 06:35.231
Cairo. And the airplane was? No problem. Had a very 
good crew. I forget what problem, was it an oil

06:39.476 --> 06:42.720
valve or something? Where'd you get the part? 
Didn't need a part. Cleaning or something? Or a

06:48.169 --> 06:48.689
leak. One came loose, and I'm getting one of those. 
Now, tell me about some other field visits that you

06:52.352 --> 06:55.575
made. Well,

06:55.716 --> 07:00.900
most of the other visits were down at the shuttle 
bases. I go down there frequently. Piraeacan,

07:03.082 --> 07:07.266
Poltava, and- Poltava? Poltava. In Romania? 
Poltava and the Ukraine area. Okay, in the

07:12.411 --> 07:14.493
Ukraine. Yeah. The three of them. Two of them were 
bomber recovery bases and one was a fighter

07:16.018 --> 07:31.854
recovery base and it was just wide open field area 
where steel planking for runways were laid down by

07:16.018 --> 07:31.854
Red Army women. A force of Red Army women. And many 
of the support forces that they moved into the

07:36.039 --> 07:42.325
bases to take care of, you can tell they were

07:46.912 --> 07:48.393
typical Red Army uniform. Always that huge 
ankle-length overcoat. Just to see it every

07:54.398 --> 07:56.140
place. Every one of them. The girl, the man, the 
kid, all of them wore that same. Air Force guy, the

08:02.605 --> 08:10.872
Army guy, the Navy guy, they always wore that long 
overcoat.

08:12.313 --> 08:13.955
The, what were the fields? The field for the We had a 
permanent force of Americans at three bases and it

08:17.675 --> 08:27.973
took months. That was a problem. We were trying to 
get adequate force to run the bases in order to take

08:30.818 --> 08:41.758
care of the reception of the aircraft and where to 
park them and take care of them. And I think we were

08:41.975 --> 08:48.024
holding out for, oh, initially around 2,000, 
2,500, something like that. We ended up with

08:48.044 --> 08:50.027
1,200. Russians always said, no, we'll take care 
of it. We'll take care of it. We'll take care of

08:54.713 --> 08:55.594
that. So you had about 1,200 men at each one of 
these. 1,200 Americans. And each one of them had to

08:59.420 --> 09:01.162
have visas. That's another thing that held us up. 
Each one of them had to have visas. Generally

09:07.592 --> 09:08.573
stating. The difficulty we had in laying on these 
bases and laying on for military operations, we

09:09.869 --> 09:26.630
continually came face to face with the Red Army, 
with the communist bureaucracy of keeping

09:09.869 --> 09:26.630
foreigners out of the nation. Sure. Keep it at an 
absolute minimum. If the ones that are permitted,

09:29.633 --> 09:35.961
they must be documented and have visas and 
research and so forth and so on. And it took time,

09:36.160 --> 09:40.866
just interminable delays. Everything we did took 
delays. Very, very frustrating. But being

09:46.092 --> 09:49.376
determined, we did it. And I don't know how many 
Russians they had to support and supply and feed

09:49.977 --> 09:59.769
us, but they had enough. And they did the job. The 
bases were hit. And we lost a lot of B-17s over there

10:05.135 --> 10:08.219
one night. And this, they, part of the agreement 
was, they would provide the air defense. They

10:14.346 --> 10:19.633
would not permit us to have any air defense forces 
there at all. No fighters. No fighters at all. Only

10:21.315 --> 10:21.956
bombers. As a matter of fact, our fighters, the 
bombers, would not be permitted to take off in an

10:21.976 --> 10:27.823
air defense role. This was all understood before 
we even laid on any of the missions. But before we

10:33.637 --> 10:39.704
get to the attack, to go back to the support was 
adequate. But the time it took to do things is what

10:40.164 --> 10:46.231
was so frustrating. Tents were arranged and put up 
for the crew. The crew slept in tents. And they'd

10:52.338 --> 11:01.348
just stay long enough to rearm, refuel, and then 
take off on another mission and go back, really,

10:52.338 --> 11:01.348
about an overnight stay, weather familiar. 
Generally, that's the way the missions were run.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.523
And they had, you know, open mess with mess kits and 
all. They had to bring the mess kits. And they went

11:08.885 --> 11:17.874
so far at first to demand that the crew members on a 
flight must have visas before they made a shuttle

11:08.885 --> 11:17.874
mission. Well, eventually, up to ambassadorial 
level, and maybe even stalling above Molotov, I

11:18.554 --> 11:25.301
don't know, but we got that eliminated. That was 
just, you know, impossible. Plus, it made...

11:29.999 --> 11:33.402
jeopardize the mission by giving away some of the 
secrecy. Well, at times you almost came to the

11:33.842 --> 11:43.051
conclusion that they were purposely putting 
these obstacles in your path to discourage us from

11:33.842 --> 11:43.051
doing it. Looking back now, I don't think they 
really, matter of fact, I know they didn't want to

11:43.691 --> 11:57.944
do this because it exposed their country and their 
situation more to foreigners, a la the Berlin

11:43.691 --> 11:57.944
Wall. They just wanted us out. They didn't want 
foreigners in.

12:04.921 --> 12:07.165
So tell me about the conditions of these three 
bases. They were livable. The steel plank, of

12:09.188 --> 12:12.594
course, we had experience operating on them. We 
knew that there was no problem operating on those.

12:15.018 --> 12:15.919
On the steel planks? Yeah. Landing and take-offs. 
The parking, as long as it wasn't in In bad weather,

12:21.957 --> 12:32.170
if it rained, we'd have to cancel the mission 
because these airplanes, particularly loaded

12:21.957 --> 12:32.170
B-17s, couldn't taxi that mud, black mud of the 
Ukraine. Crimea, not Crimea, but the Ukraine

12:32.190 --> 12:34.212
area. No concrete, of course. But we had enough 
maintenance people locally just for turnaround,

12:39.399 --> 12:50.212
and 1,200 people we had, including— That's 1,200 
at each base. Totally. They had about 400 men at

12:51.961 --> 12:56.426
each base. Right, and a certain amount of that was 
staff to maintain relations with General

12:58.068 --> 13:07.959
Perminoff, who was a Russian general in charge. He 
supported the three bases. They had a little

13:09.401 --> 13:12.985
organization, and we had a little organization. I 
think they came out of the 8th Air Force.

13:22.066 --> 13:24.048
The food was adequate. Mostly flown in by the 
bombers? Mostly the food was flown in by the

13:26.731 --> 13:29.314
bombers? No, no. Matter of fact, we flew supplies 
in around through Tehran and up from Tehran in

13:29.955 --> 13:36.903
transport aircraft. One of the biggest problems 
was the belly tanks that we had to ferry in on each

13:37.164 --> 13:46.875
mission, or at least have ready at the base.

13:52.475 --> 13:57.642
I think it was about 30 or 40 of them, see, recovered 
in one base. And they'd dropped their tanks, see,

13:58.844 --> 14:01.908
on the flight across. They'd used up their fuel, 
and the only way to get back was to have more fuel

14:02.448 --> 14:06.754
tanks, belly tanks. So we had to ferry those in. And 
here they'd stop the transport at Tehran and say

14:09.077 --> 14:16.047
they had to wait to get visas for the crew. Well, 
that, of course, that actually caused several

14:16.067 --> 14:20.052
missions to be scrubbed. Many times, the protocol 
demands of the bureaucracy of Moscow caused us to

14:20.437 --> 14:29.346
struggle out of bombing missions. As time went on, 
we worked out some of these problems where things

14:29.366 --> 14:36.834
got a little more routine, and it worked a little 
bit more smoothly. Towards the end, it was working

14:37.154 --> 14:39.857
fairly well. But just with this containing 
persistence, did we ever get anything done.

14:49.799 --> 14:51.622
But eventually, it got done. So the food was 
adequate, and the men slumped in tents. And they'd

14:55.529 --> 15:05.786
come in off a mission over Germany, land in the 
Ukraine, stay there overnight, refuel, and

14:55.529 --> 15:05.786
rearm, and hit Germany on the way back to France. 
Yeah, on the way back, primarily Germany. And

15:10.033 --> 15:15.182
then, of course, 15th Air Force Midley began to 
make missions up. fly across and hit maybe Romania

15:15.905 --> 15:22.594
or Germany or some place, then recover and fly 
back. It was effective, and of course it made for

15:23.194 --> 15:36.051
closer coordination, supposedly, between 
Russia and us in the eventual pizza movement

15:23.194 --> 15:36.051
against Germany. But looking back now, I'm not too 
sure how effective it was because there was one

15:43.394 --> 15:54.210
colonel assigned to our mission in Moscow who was 
to coordinate targeting for the Red Air Force. And

15:54.230 --> 16:05.046
this was to always know exactly where the front 
lines of the Russians were so when we planned a

15:54.230 --> 16:05.046
target we didn't want to overrun. And they were 
advancing very rapidly and taking the big cities

16:05.466 --> 16:08.991
back. So we had to maintain close liaison with 
them. But this colonel who had that job initially

16:13.111 --> 16:25.168
met with a Red Air Force colonel in the Kremlin and 
met him and discussed what they were supposed to

16:13.111 --> 16:25.168
do. That's the only time he ever saw him. He 
remained over there for six months, never had

16:27.170 --> 16:32.838
another meeting, and got to the point where he 
said, boy, he almost became an alcoholic. They

16:33.699 --> 16:35.161
just sent him back. That was the amount of 
coordination between the forces for

16:35.181 --> 16:41.430
Pinsonville. So you never did bomb then? There was 
never an occasion. So you only bombed from the

16:45.677 --> 16:50.442
American side and you never bombed for the Red Army 
advancing? See, that's one of the things we wanted

16:50.462 --> 16:52.304
to do. We wanted to coordinate with the advances 
and make bomb targets really in effect, if you

16:52.644 --> 17:00.913
will, tactical support in advance of the oncoming 
Red Army. They never did work out that way. The

17:02.735 --> 17:10.303
Russians didn't want us to do it because they 
figured we'd destroy places and they wanted to

17:02.735 --> 17:10.303
take them intact and they didn't want want to 
destroy it. They didn't want to do it. So

17:13.935 --> 17:16.057
basically, they didn't want to work with us on it. 
They just worked with us on the surface. Follow

17:18.940 --> 17:22.284
General Book, General Dean Book, The Strange 
Alliance. Right. Now, what about, now there's

17:23.245 --> 17:36.419
been the issue of American air flyers and crews 
that went down right on or around behind the

17:23.245 --> 17:36.419
Russian lines. And after the war, the We were 
wondering if they had held any of those people, and

17:39.494 --> 17:58.745
I've read some of the dispatches from Harriman 
back to Roosevelt in which he says that the

17:39.494 --> 17:58.745
Russians weren't very forthcoming about getting 
our pilots back to the embassy and then we could fly

17:39.494 --> 17:58.745
them out again. Do you remember anything like 
that? I remember the Pacific Cape you're talking

18:00.307 --> 18:02.250
about. The Pacific Cape you're talking about, to a 
B-29 crew in a Japanese war, an attack against

18:06.882 --> 18:20.858
Japan where a B-29 had to recover in Russia, north 
of Vladivostok area, because of maintenance

18:06.882 --> 18:20.858
problems, or maybe damage. But some way or 
another, and this was sort of the early periods of

18:20.878 --> 18:30.169
this type of coordination relation with Russia.

18:33.533 --> 18:36.737
They held the crew, and some way or another, they 
just wouldn't cooperate with the ambassador in

18:36.937 --> 18:48.899
transferring them to Moscow, where if the 
ambassador didn't want to talk to them, they'd get

18:36.937 --> 18:48.899
them on home. For some reason or another, they just 
wouldn't do it, and it took the ambassador a long

18:49.520 --> 18:56.633
time, and personally, I think personally, 
Probably, Roosevelt eventually probably sent

18:56.765 --> 19:00.509
out a personal water stallion. I have an idea he 
must have. But eventually it broke loose, and all

19:01.850 --> 19:05.233
of a sudden it just broke loose, and no problem 
whatsoever. It was exactly the reverse. They

19:06.935 --> 19:10.978
couldn't do enough for us to cooperate, to get the 
crew back and all. Just outstanding, you know. But

19:13.701 --> 19:18.045
that's the only occasion I remember at first. 
After that, I guess after the decision was made,

19:18.365 --> 19:26.333
passed down to the chain, and there was no fear of 
superiors Maybe a Russian was doing something

19:27.038 --> 19:33.084
wrong, and the stage was set, and orders were 
given, and that thing worked all right after that.

19:33.104 --> 19:39.691
Now, the few Russians, the few Americans that were 
shot down behind a Russian mine were in the

19:33.104 --> 19:39.691
European theater of operation. Normally, there 
was a few occasions of that happening, and there

19:39.711 --> 19:47.940
was no particular problem getting those politics 
back. They were helpful. Yeah. Cooperative

19:49.742 --> 19:52.725
helpful.

19:53.549 --> 19:55.070
I say cooperative and helpful. In the way you and I 
look at it, you might say, well, reluctantly they

19:55.491 --> 20:03.217
did it, or with delaying tactics they did it.

20:06.340 --> 20:17.970
Just never, never been able to understand why 
this, except that maybe superstition and fear of

20:06.340 --> 20:17.970
doing something wrong from above. Discipline is 
a, discipline in Russia is a, in my opinion, a

20:17.990 --> 20:23.134
terrible thing. A mistake made in Russia, to me, 
must be a terrible thing. In time of war, I'm sure

20:31.892 --> 20:38.840
many of them were shot.

20:39.000 --> 20:45.847
On this flight I was telling you about, where I was a 
navigator back from out of the cockpit, it was

20:39.000 --> 20:45.847
after the Tehran conference. The ambassador 
wanted to get back to Moscow very fast. The weather

20:48.730 --> 20:50.953
was terrible, horrible. Snow stormed all the way 
up. And he couldn't fly above them? Yeah. Well, to

20:56.588 --> 21:09.582
fly above them, that's what I tried to do, but there 
was no nav agent in Moscow at that time, except for

20:56.588 --> 21:09.582
me trying to monitor a commercial radio station, 
maybe with my radio compass, and then there's

20:56.588 --> 21:09.582
still no letdown procedure. And whether there it 
goes clear, it goes around, zero, zero. But at any

21:14.227 --> 21:16.690
rate, I took off and said, we can try it. Well, I 
wanted to. I wanted to impress Molotov. Who sent

21:21.295 --> 21:22.416
out that message? impressed Molotov and says, do 
you think we can do it? And I said, well, we can try, I

21:26.398 --> 21:29.061
think we can. I remember General Dean was worried. 
Why did he want to impress Molotov? Well, see, one

21:32.104 --> 21:36.328
of our objectives was to build up the Air Transport 
Command routes. They showed that weather was no

21:37.069 --> 21:38.510
problem. We could get through, you know, with an 
airplane. Molotov went back by rail. And I took off

21:43.856 --> 21:46.438
and started back. And by the way, we had the British 
Ambassador aboard, too, in that flight. And I got

21:49.982 --> 21:51.743
Norris. Did you really? Yeah. take him back. It was 
after the Tehran conference, going back to

21:53.531 --> 21:58.296
Moscow. What was his name, Lord? He was a tall 
Scottish man. Well, Clark Carr was later, but this

22:03.802 --> 22:08.707
was not Clark Carr, this was a man before him. And I 
met him, by the way, and loved him. Love Clark Carr?

22:13.752 --> 22:15.615
Oh, that's true. But anyway, we took off and I got a 
little north of Donningrath.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.444
one of my checkpoints. And it was beginning to get 
over the overcast and I didn't want to do it. So I

22:28.130 --> 22:40.127
turned around, went back down to where the 
overcast ran out, let down and then came back and

22:28.130 --> 22:40.127
was going to fly under it all the way to Moscow.

22:41.849 --> 22:51.904
And it kept getting lower and lower and lower and 
finally I was, you know, over 500 feet above the

22:41.849 --> 22:51.904
ground. Fortunately, it was snowing, and as a 
result of continual snowing, not real dense snow,

22:52.137 --> 23:03.138
I could see forward visibility of maybe a couple of 
miles. But as a result of the snowing, the

23:03.158 --> 23:09.010
precipitation didn't fog up or anything, so I 
could see well enough. It was that way all the way up

23:09.030 --> 23:11.014
to Moscow. But I got lost. The navigator had no idea 
where I was, and I looked over at him, Russian

23:14.733 --> 23:23.543
navigator, and boy, his beads were swept around me 
as far as he was scared to death. And finally I

23:23.563 --> 23:30.291
looked over at my copilot and I said, get walked up 
there, my navigator. So I told him. First I had to

23:33.335 --> 23:36.859
get the interpreter up and tell him to get this 
Russian navigator back. Boy, he didn't want to go,

23:36.879 --> 23:39.602
but I said, back? First time I ever talked in a 
command directly to him, back. And we got back and

23:47.525 --> 23:51.549
got my navigator out there and we took him back. He 
says, we'll just find a double railroad. There's a

23:54.712 --> 23:56.734
double railroad here someplace. We find that. We 
know that leads to Moscow. And I found it. And got

24:01.098 --> 24:07.364
right down on top of that railroad, flying about 
1,500 feet above it. No kidding? With my head stuck

24:08.265 --> 24:13.410
out in a bubble on the side of my airplane, flying it 
manually all the way to Moscow. And as we came into

24:14.183 --> 24:17.247
Moscow— Of course, you knew the terrain. There 
weren't any mountains. Oh, no, it's flat. Wasn't

24:20.230 --> 24:21.011
anything. No mountains or no—it

24:21.932 --> 24:27.779
was sort of prairie land all the way down. And not 
even any rolling hills, just flat. And you know, as

24:32.524 --> 24:40.433
long as it stayed above that railroad, there 
couldn't be anything higher than the railroad

24:32.524 --> 24:40.433
poles, telephone poles. And finally hit— the city 
of Moscow and flew right square over the top of the,

24:42.719 --> 24:47.525
I buzzed the Kremlin. I guess it's the only time 
it's ever been buzzed. I couldn't have been over 50

24:49.527 --> 24:51.991
feet above it. And spied the airport and came in and 
landed. And I was, I admit, I was worried. Here I had

24:58.078 --> 25:05.447
the ambassador on board, daughter of General 
Dean, a British ambassador. And I must admit, I was

25:05.467 --> 25:07.209
real worried. I had visions of going down, you 
know, The responsibility was terrible. What a

25:15.018 --> 25:18.083
relief when I landed there. First guy that got off 
was this British, well of course he got off as the

25:18.103 --> 25:27.499
ambassador, but he may have gotten in his car and I 
understand he stayed in bed about a week. He was

25:27.519 --> 25:28.601
scared. No. He just got sick. And the ambassador of 
course he felt equally as I. I remember sending a

25:36.449 --> 25:41.937
message back to the ambassador telling him, we may 
have to land at Raman Skoy. That was a big air base

25:41.997 --> 25:45.182
just south of Moscow. And his, which is typical of 
him, he's back to the interpreter. Tell me exactly

25:51.110 --> 25:55.637
why you think we will have to land at Raman Skoy. He 
didn't pray. He said, tell me exactly why. And he

25:58.861 --> 26:06.372
told me, well, I'm not sure that I'll be able to fly 
over the city at low altitude and find Central

25:58.861 --> 26:06.372
Airport. But I will try to get it in Central 
Airport, where, you know, we're supposed to land,

26:06.638 --> 26:11.743
normally land. So he didn't question me anymore. 
But he was equally glad when we landed, I could

26:14.606 --> 26:19.492
tell. As a matter of fact, he came up and personally 
complimented me and said, you know, something

26:19.512 --> 26:26.719
like, I appreciate this. And I said, I'll tell Mr. 
Molotov. The next day, he had a meeting with Mr.

26:30.023 --> 26:33.226
Molotov. Mr. Molotov had heard. about me ordering 
this navigator in the back of the airplane. He told

26:40.345 --> 26:42.167
the ambassador all about this. He had heard that. 
Now, that's how it got to him. And expressed

26:45.853 --> 26:50.139
concern that we would take such a chance. And the 
ambassador told me, I just, he said, well, I just

26:51.081 --> 26:55.527
told him, well, it's typical flights of humor. We 
knew we'd make it. And of course, the ambassador,

26:59.453 --> 27:03.078
when he was telling me this, he was kind of grinning 
about it, too. He knew it was, but he, he, He had made

27:06.612 --> 27:09.616
a point, you know, with the ambassador. And he was 
quite proud of it. And he thought I was great, even

27:10.957 --> 27:14.362
greater than before. But incidentally, I never 
saw that navigator again. No kidding. They

27:18.727 --> 27:21.871
replaced him on the airplane. End of that story. 
Well, that's fascinating.

27:27.778 --> 27:34.847
Did you know Sir Clark, not Clark, Sir Frank 
Roberts, who was the assistant to Clark Kerr? in

27:35.603 --> 27:39.189
the British Embassy.

27:39.449 --> 27:44.057
He was Kennan's counterpart in the British 
Embassy. I'm sure I must have met him, but I don't

27:44.077 --> 27:48.885
know him, but I don't remember his name. Okay. Were 
there any other field visits, or have we covered

27:50.908 --> 27:54.955
all of those?

27:59.342 --> 28:00.625
Yeah, I think we have. That's all I've got to take. I 
almost got a chance to take a trip along the

28:02.215 --> 28:11.874
Transylvania Railroad to Vladivostok, but 
instead of me they sent an army colonel. I think it

28:11.894 --> 28:14.760
took him ten days to make that trip.

28:19.248 --> 28:21.152
Now let's talk about the conferences. that you 
went to, the wartime conferences. You went to the

28:24.577 --> 28:27.181
Tehran conference and the Cairo conference. Yes. 
When I say I went to the conference, I flew the

28:27.903 --> 28:30.547
ambassador down. I didn't actually participate 
at that level. No, I know. But I flew him down, the

28:33.912 --> 28:38.579
Tehran conference. You can imagine the time it 
took in arrangements that would take to make

28:39.260 --> 28:46.872
arrangements like that, and the secrecy of it. I 
didn't even know at that time I'd say until about 24

28:50.900 --> 28:58.350
hours before takeoff of what was going on. I just 
figured I was taking the ambassador on a trip to

28:58.370 --> 29:00.733
Iran. And I never did feel free to query the 
ambassador about anything about why I was going on

29:01.655 --> 29:11.047
this trip. So I didn't know why. That's how secret 
it was. I'm sure if Moscow proper only In our group,

29:19.081 --> 29:24.146
I guess, Harriman and General Dean knew about the 
planning. Probably counting until? Until 24, I'm

29:25.868 --> 29:28.290
sure. And of course, took him down with General 
Dean. General Dean attended with him. I remember

29:35.197 --> 29:44.647
the ambassador, it

29:35.197 --> 29:44.647
may have been General Dean who told me this, but I 
remember this comment. It sort of compares the

29:44.807 --> 29:48.531
three big leaders to you. Churchill, Darlene, and 
Roosevelt. At the opening of the conference, I

29:52.542 --> 30:04.436
believe it was Ambassador Herman telling General 
Dean about this, or then General Dean telling me,

29:52.542 --> 30:04.436
or maybe it was Ambassador Herman who told me about 
this. He said, Mr. Roosevelt stood up and made a

30:04.996 --> 30:15.328
very good opening speech, you know, very 
impressive as usual and all. It took five or six

30:16.355 --> 30:17.617
minutes. Then Mr. Churchill got up, and as usual, 
kicking English around. He did terrific. He made a

30:25.849 --> 30:28.232
wonderful speech and all, and sat down. And 
Staline got up and said to his interpreter,

30:29.173 --> 30:39.588
gentlemen, let's get to work, and sat down.

30:40.490 --> 30:42.953
Staline, I met him and shook hands with him. Tell me 
about that. When we presented our credentials

30:44.843 --> 30:53.516
initially, you know, when I first arrived in 
Moscow, when the ambassador presented his

30:44.843 --> 30:53.516
credentials, I went with him. I actually shook 
hands with Stalin, a little sharp guy, very

30:54.157 --> 30:59.385
impressive. And obviously to me, you know, here I 
am meeting Stalin. Tell me about that. Well, I was

31:06.115 --> 31:08.638
impressed with the man. He was sharp and another 
human being. When I look back now, but in the

31:13.139 --> 31:21.787
Kremlin, me, Charlie Baum, taking hands with Mr. 
Starling, I'll never forget it. And of course, I

31:22.348 --> 31:24.630
was impressed. I was impressed with the 
surroundings, just the occasion, and just

31:24.650 --> 31:29.855
overall. That's the closest that I ever got to him. 
I did see him a couple of times at the Bolshoi

31:34.099 --> 31:39.804
Theater on a special performance when Churchill 
visited. Incidentally, he hated Churchill's

31:39.824 --> 31:42.707
guts and vice versa. And Harriman and Roosevelt 
knew it. Roosevelt had to be sort of a temporal or

31:46.259 --> 31:55.250
the arbitrating type of a guy between them. They 
despised each other. Tell me about the Kremlin and

31:58.393 --> 32:04.060
Stalin's office. I was never in Stalin's office. 
We were in the reception room where Stalin came

32:06.222 --> 32:10.247
into.

32:11.881 --> 32:15.807
It's a typical government bureaucratic 
building, if you will. If I remember correctly,

32:16.167 --> 32:23.118
the walls, sort of a fortress wall around the 
entire Kremlin. The Kremlin is a group of

32:23.138 --> 32:26.263
buildings. Oh, yeah. Well, you've seen it. The 
inside of it is the grounds of manicure in the

32:30.008 --> 32:35.416
summertime. Of course, everything covers snow in 
the wintertime. But if I remember correctly, the

32:37.840 --> 32:41.145
buildings were cream plastered. And not bleak 
like right outside the walls of the Kremlin, like

32:41.851 --> 32:47.417
the city was. Bleak and dreary and unmaintained. 
Inside of it was immaculate. The inside of the

32:52.882 --> 33:04.093
buildings were, comparatively speaking, to our 
big office buildings and government buildings,

32:52.882 --> 33:04.093
very bare. Pictures on a wall, maybe of Lenin and 
Stalin.

33:12.547 --> 33:23.342
very, the furniture was just the plainest stuff in 
the world, even in the main conference room.

33:23.362 --> 33:28.088
Always the green velvet cover for the conference 
table. Felt, felt covered, green felt, like a pool

33:28.108 --> 33:31.392
table. That's the typical Russian conference 
table, with bottles of water, purified water, and

33:42.162 --> 33:54.175
vodka and goblets on the table, Russian 
cigarettes about, arranged for conferences,

33:42.162 --> 33:54.175
neatly, neat and clean inside. No flies in there, 
like in Winningfield. Not primitive in nature

33:59.441 --> 34:02.364
there. In other words, the best of Russia, but yet 
plain. No RNA. Austere is the word. Austere.

34:13.217 --> 34:18.323
Marble floors, that type of thing. And, of course, 
guards and sentries every place. And when you

34:23.811 --> 34:28.417
arrived at the Kremlin, how long did Stalin keep 
you and Mr. Harriman waiting? Was Dean with you?

34:30.119 --> 34:31.020
Yes. You three? Well, there may have been others, 
but I remember specifically Mr. Harriman,

34:32.022 --> 34:40.333
General Dean, And since I was the ambassador's 
aide, I was along. Now, also, the supply general

34:45.461 --> 34:52.392
may have been along, the Lindley supply general. I 
forget his name. Again, it would be in that book,

34:53.974 --> 34:56.017
The Stranger Lines. But he was there. And I think 
the reason

34:57.719 --> 35:09.477
Mr. Herman's approach, and we actually talked 
about this at times, it was very evident. He took

35:09.980 --> 35:12.264
all of us along. Normally, let's say, you know, 
maybe strictly diplomatically speaking, maybe

35:12.424 --> 35:20.659
just he personally, without even an interpreter, 
should have gone. But here, you know, I think he was

35:20.679 --> 35:33.642
trying to break the wall down between Russia and us 
from a standpoint of communication and try to get

35:20.679 --> 35:33.642
things on an informal basis and Look, in effect, 
look, I've got a lot of people here, and I want them

35:33.908 --> 35:38.353
to talk. They've got to talk to your people, and 
let's talk. This is always his objective. And for

35:44.701 --> 35:49.267
some reason or another, it didn't take. He 
generally got the audience of Molotov any time he

35:51.409 --> 35:55.875
asked for it. And many times, by the way, it's 
strange, I'd hear General Dean talk about this,

35:59.069 --> 36:09.519
and it always turned out to be even some of the minor 
conferences between some of the other liaison

35:59.069 --> 36:09.519
intelligence people and communications people. 
They'd have the conference at maybe 2 o'clock in

36:09.539 --> 36:11.761
the morning. Yeah, I know that.

36:20.389 --> 36:23.692
Stone and Molotov were night people. They were 
night people. Night people? Oh, yeah. Matter of

36:27.096 --> 36:28.637
fact, the hierarchy. at night people. And I dare 
say this may still be true. Definitely during the

36:33.138 --> 36:36.121
war it was. And when you went, let's get back to when 
you presented your credentials. When you went,

36:39.805 --> 36:43.789
you gentlemen went to the Kremlin. You went to the 
reception room. How long did you wait before

36:46.272 --> 36:48.274
Stalin came out? And then can you describe the 
situation and give me your impressions?

36:55.121 --> 36:56.502
How do we call this waiting too long? We did wait. 
Then he came in the opposite end of the room and made

36:57.406 --> 37:06.056
me walk across with an interpreter right next to 
him, an ambassador, a hairman. How was he dressed?

37:07.718 --> 37:11.722
I think he was dressed in tunic, military type 
uniform, army type uniform. The white one? No, no.

37:17.308 --> 37:24.156
The greenish gray and the slacks and the tunic 
buttons all the way at the top. He rode the Soviet

37:24.608 --> 37:31.097
Union, you know, that gold medal hanging from a, I 
mean the gold star hanging from a little red rivet.

37:31.938 --> 37:34.802
One of those, a mustache. So he didn't have, he 
didn't have- I had epaulettes on, but I don't even

37:35.623 --> 37:44.234
remember what was on the top of the

37:35.623 --> 37:44.234
epaulettes. Yeah, he had epaulettes on. I don't 
remember the insignia on the top. Well, you know, a

37:50.923 --> 37:53.687
lot of the time he was referred to as Marshall 
Stalin. Oh, yeah, I know. OK, so he walked in, and

37:56.263 --> 37:58.845
you all stood up? He walked in, made you walk across 
to shake hands with the ambassador. And

38:02.029 --> 38:08.196
obviously, I forget exactly what he said, but the 
interpreter then would tell Mr. Ambassador and

38:08.216 --> 38:15.644
airmen in English, you know, delighted to have 
you, and all of that type of stuff. And then right

38:15.724 --> 38:19.528
down the line, immediately, you know, going right 
down to me. I don't even say anything. He shook

38:20.810 --> 38:23.893
hands with me, and in effect, I don't even He may 
have looked at me, but I don't even remember him

38:24.498 --> 38:27.621
looking me straight in the eye. I looked him 
straight in the eye. I was impressed with the, you

38:31.785 --> 38:34.788
know, awed, if you will. I was awed down at him. Oh, 
yeah. He was shorter than I. How did he look up

38:40.754 --> 38:41.855
close?

38:44.998 --> 38:50.363
He looked heavy, a little, not fat, but stocky. 
Stocky is the word. Did he look tired or energetic?

38:54.250 --> 38:55.912
No, he looked tired. He definitely was not a 
sunburned man. No. He definitely was white.

39:03.503 --> 39:05.446
Closely shaven except for his mustache. 
Immaculate.

39:09.952 --> 39:11.214
Short hair. Gray.

39:16.601 --> 39:17.202
No glasses. I don't think we ever sat down. It was a 
short meeting, and that's what you do with those,

39:21.309 --> 39:24.994
you put out the credentials. And I think there were 
some actual papers that Harriman gave to one of his

39:25.014 --> 39:32.565
people with him. It eventually turned out two more 
people came in behind him. I forget who they were. A

39:37.772 --> 39:40.736
tennis, I guess, tape of papers, that type of 
thing. And after, it was only a few minutes, more

39:40.756 --> 39:45.222
than at the most. I think we did have a vodka. I think 
we did have a vodka. Well, in eight or ten minutes,

39:49.885 --> 39:55.272
we were leaving.

39:55.292 --> 39:57.815
And at that type of meeting, it's very short. No, of 
course, no business done. No. And we bid him

40:01.319 --> 40:11.572
goodbye, and I think we turned around and left him 
rather than him leaving us. In other words, he saw

40:11.592 --> 40:13.935
us through the door.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.381
conference room. Oh, 20 by 20 feet. One big table in 
the middle. And then you went back to the

40:23.907 --> 40:28.574
automobile, and what were the comments of your 
colleagues?

40:34.022 --> 40:41.333
I don't remember any particular comments except 
that all of us seemed to be impressed. I think it was

40:42.695 --> 40:47.922
more of thoughtful soul-searching and silence 
rather than discussion If I remember correctly. I

40:51.848 --> 40:53.911
don't remember anybody saying anything to me. I 
don't recall.

41:02.666 --> 41:06.392
I know the ambassador subsequently saw Charlene a 
lot of times. He was representing the President of

41:07.113 --> 41:12.062
the United States. He wasn't representing the 
Secretary of State. OK, so let's switch then from

41:15.914 --> 41:30.112
your meeting in Stalin to that conference that you 
went to, your first conference.

41:30.132 --> 41:32.117
We were talking about the Cairo, right? Oh, the 
Tehran conference. Oh, yeah, all right. We were

41:36.169 --> 41:40.056
talking about the Tehran conference, and you said 
you flew them down there. Then we flew back, you

41:40.076 --> 41:41.839
know. But while you were there, what did you do? Did 
you just wait for them? Well, I just waited a day. I

41:46.727 --> 41:49.752
think we stayed there about a week. And at one time I 
told you the story already of trying to, is this on

41:49.934 --> 41:54.701
your recording? Yeah, you've already told the 
story where you attempted to get up. To the guards,

41:57.585 --> 41:58.466
yeah. Yeah, okay. Then, well, that's just about 
all that. Did you have any opportunity to see any of

42:01.430 --> 42:04.094
these leaders? I never. You never got to see 
Roosevelt? No, never saw any dignitaries at all.

42:09.060 --> 42:11.003
Never got to see Churchill? No. I subsequently 
saw, several months later, on one of Churchill's

42:12.745 --> 42:18.253
visits, The Moscow. The Moscow. And 
incidentally, Churchill flew straight across

42:19.346 --> 42:26.517
Europe over Germany at night in his airplane to 
visit him. He didn't fly around the combat area.

42:32.686 --> 42:39.055
And I saw Churchill at the Bolshoi Theater with 
Staline, or Swan Lake, by the way. And he stood up

42:39.195 --> 42:43.321
to, you know, standing applause from the crowd. 
And Staline walked back, actually walked out of

42:43.341 --> 42:48.088
the Lodz area so that Churchill could take the 
honors. And he was dressed in his old

42:51.117 --> 42:55.383
parachute-type suit. That's the only time I've 
seen Churchill. Again, a very impressive person.

43:01.873 --> 43:03.055
Very impressive person. Did they give him a 
standing ovation?

43:09.384 --> 43:11.668
Oh, yeah. Then, of course, the Cairo Conference. 
It was later on. I think that must have been in

43:15.193 --> 43:17.316
October of 44. No, it was later than that. No, no, 
no, no. October of 44 when Churchill visited. He

43:25.694 --> 43:28.618
did visit for about 10 days in October of 1944. 
Well, he made, actually Stein made, I think, I

43:29.959 --> 43:38.732
mean, Churchill made at least two visits while I 
was over there. Yeah. Besides the Turin and Cairo,

43:39.974 --> 43:44.680
but the Moscow proper, I think he visited at least 
twice. Okay, okay. Now, What about the other

43:47.772 --> 43:49.794
conference? The Cairo conference, it's the same 
type of affair, except there,

43:49.814 --> 44:09.218
except there of course, we discussed the Japanese 
situation, and Chenault was there at that

43:49.814 --> 44:09.218
conference, and I got a chance to visit Chenault. 
But there again, I just flew them down, and they

44:09.498 --> 44:17.087
attended, and I waited, and it was about the same 
duration, but during the time I was waiting, of

44:09.498 --> 44:17.087
course, the generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was in 
Chicago, and Chennault was with him, so I got to

44:17.540 --> 44:39.671
visit with Chennault one evening after dinner, 
and I think I stayed there maybe a couple of hours,

44:17.540 --> 44:39.671
just talking about old times, discussing, of 
course, his situation. What did he have to say?

44:45.856 --> 44:48.278
I don't recall exactly. There was nothing 
outstanding it makes me recall other than the fact

44:48.299 --> 44:58.008
that he's sorry that I didn't get back to serve with 
him. And he wished I had. And I told him I wished I

44:59.410 --> 45:01.312
had. And I recounted for his experience what 
Arnold said. And he said, you'd be surprised. I

45:07.018 --> 45:11.302
heard that about 24 hours after it happened. And he 
got quite a kick out of that. And apparently by

45:14.307 --> 45:29.360
then, you know, the earlier distaste and 
hostility between Arnold and Chenault had faded

45:14.307 --> 45:29.360
because now, you know, Chenault was a major 
general commanding the 14th Air Force and the

45:14.307 --> 45:29.360
chain of command. And of course Arnold was his 
boss, so apparently they were getting along all

45:29.380 --> 45:35.505
right. He really looks typical, same as usual. No 
change whatsoever. As long as I've ever known him,

45:44.328 --> 45:47.151
Of course, I'd seen him over a period of about five 
years. He never changed his look. He always looked

45:48.932 --> 45:51.334
the same. He, of course, had his problems with 
supply. And he was always on the bottom of the

45:55.038 --> 45:59.222
priority list, forgetting anything. And he told 
me of those troubles. We talked in generalities.

46:06.088 --> 46:07.809
Was it a satisfying meeting? Oh, yeah. Except that 
I was glad to see him again. He asked me a lot of

46:11.935 --> 46:16.743
certain questions about the Russians. You see, he 
had had relations with Russian people, including

46:17.784 --> 46:24.555
some of the pilots in China earlier. They 
delivered Chinese aircraft, so he knew a little

46:24.595 --> 46:33.529
bit about it, which surprised me. I don't recall, I 
think his, he had a little bit

46:42.614 --> 46:48.164
So you flew back from the Cairo conference and you 
didn't have any problem as far as... No, we didn't

46:42.614 --> 46:48.164
have any. No more problem like that. And did the 
Ambassador ever make any statements to you on the

46:50.348 --> 46:59.325
way back about anything that was discussed? Oh, 
no.
