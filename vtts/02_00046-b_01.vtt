WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:04.793
on top of the Ag building. Oh, it was just so 
tremendous. Do you remember going to Muster when

00:07.458 --> 00:09.803
you were a student? The only time I remember going 
to Muster was when we mustered with Corregidor in

00:11.466 --> 00:17.459
1942. You mean? Corregidor.

00:23.251 --> 00:25.414
You mean when they came back after the war was over? 
No, sir. While they were on Corregidor. Describe

00:27.297 --> 00:28.098
that one. Oh, that was, we all went down.

00:35.069 --> 00:40.838
I was standing in front of the Ag building and they 
had speakers all over the place and General Moore,

00:41.577 --> 01:11.213
who was our commandant, got on the air, and he says 
how happy he was to address the Corps and A&M, and

00:41.577 --> 01:11.213
they're all doing fine and well, and that the 
Aggies, I think he said there were about 22 Aggies

00:41.577 --> 01:11.213
there, and

00:41.577 --> 01:11.213
they asked if any of the A&M graduates who were 
there on Corregidor if they had something to say

01:11.193 --> 01:20.344
and they would typical, hey Aggies, old Army, how 
you doing? We didn't say howdy then. It was old

01:23.427 --> 01:24.228
Army. But it was very solemn. Was there anyone on 
Corregidor that you had known personally? Carl

01:31.477 --> 01:32.678
Pipkin. Carl Pipkin? Pipkin. P-I-P-K-I-N. Yes, 
sir. He was there. And, of course, I knew Colonel

01:38.845 --> 01:41.749
Moore. Now, had he been the commandant here before 
he left? Left. He was a colonel. And he left and went

01:48.700 --> 01:52.605
to Pacific and became a general.

01:55.650 --> 02:00.437
But other than that, I can't recall any other 
names. Aggies that I knew, probably if I heard the

02:01.312 --> 02:05.817
names I would tell you yes or no that I knew. So

02:05.857 --> 02:16.249
you went to Yale practice regularly, Silver Taps, 
that muster you remember. What were some other

02:17.110 --> 02:26.020
events, serious or otherwise, that you and almost 
everybody felt you ought to go to? Everybody went

02:27.670 --> 02:30.252
to the football games. Everybody went to the 
basketball games. Deware Gym held, I think the

02:32.855 --> 02:38.140
seating capacity was around 4,500. There were 
7,000 of us here. I think every dadgum 7,000 cadet

02:41.383 --> 02:47.569
was in that Deware Gym.

02:49.591 --> 02:51.673
We helped make the movie, you know. We've never 
been late. We've never been late. Oh, describe

02:55.176 --> 02:56.277
that. Well, that was kind of a mass thing. I never 
individually, as handsome and good looking as I

03:00.159 --> 03:07.487
was, was never asked to pardon it. But it was all, it 
was good. We participated in it. How long were the,

03:11.431 --> 03:13.793
how long was that going on? It went on for several 
months. Really? Yeah, and they came into the mess

03:16.436 --> 03:20.340
hall and they took camera shots of us waiting 
tables and that was at Sabisa. And then we had to get

03:25.709 --> 03:36.152
down in front of the Y and have Yale practice where 
they took shots of that and they caught us marching

03:25.709 --> 03:36.152
and So that was over a period of several weeks or 
months or so. So it wasn't all done in a period of two

03:41.277 --> 03:43.959
or three days. Did you all get to see all those 
celebrities, Robert Mitchell? Oh, yeah. They'd

03:49.385 --> 03:52.828
shake hands with us and holler at us. And Gwen. 
Where did they live? Were they at the Aggieland? I

03:57.512 --> 03:59.594
think they were at the Aggieland Inn. Right. Yeah. 
And then do you remember when you saw the movie

04:01.576 --> 04:04.519
first? Yeah, what was that like? I can't believe 
that's A&M.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.697
They made it look better? They sure did. 
Glamorized it. But that was quite something. And

04:20.957 --> 04:22.138
it was nice for A&M. Did anybody, did any student or 
group of students attempt any kind of pranks or

04:22.338 --> 04:29.527
good bull while they were trying to film it? No, 
there was no demonstration of any kind. Everybody

04:33.431 --> 04:38.477
was very cooperative because they knew that it 
would help the image of the university. Now, as the

04:39.558 --> 04:43.703
war is going on, You and your buddies at night, did 
you all talk about the progress? We really didn't.

04:49.803 --> 04:51.205
We were all busy studying. We didn't talk too much 
about it. Did you think about dropping out of

04:54.670 --> 04:56.392
school? No. And volunteering? You were going to 
get your degree? I was going to get my degree before

05:00.317 --> 05:05.584
I was called up to service. Did you ever have any 
real financial problem where you had to turn to

05:06.045 --> 05:12.694
somebody to really help you out of a jam? Well, I 
know Papa went down to the bank and hocked himself

05:14.345 --> 05:20.921
up high. And my brother would send a few step-ins to 
us. But see, that was payback for me. I stayed out

05:29.783 --> 05:31.206
two years. and to help them while they were in 
college and then Papa while he was at home. I

05:36.635 --> 05:44.204
can't recall any anxieties. You're number three 
of your brothers who came to A&M. I was number three

05:50.751 --> 05:54.055
of the four of us. Oh, okay. And there are five 
brothers? No, four brothers and one sister. Oh,

05:59.903 --> 06:00.584
okay. One sister, my youngest sister. And I was 
number three. Okay, you were number three. Yeah.

06:11.159 --> 06:14.544
How did you get a date as a student? As a student? We 
never had any dates here. I had to invite them. I

06:21.457 --> 06:24.200
invited one young lady from Bay City. I'd met her 
when I worked there one summer, one winter. And I

06:28.544 --> 06:31.507
liked her and I invited her to come up. She brought 
her mother to be well chaperoned. And it was the

06:35.751 --> 06:37.473
artillery ball. And it was nice. But dates, we 
would write TSCW and say we got this infantry ball

06:40.876 --> 06:51.447
or whatever ball we had. How many girls could come 
and they would write back and say we've got 60, 70,

06:51.427 --> 06:56.814
100 girls. So we would vacate a dormitory and let 
them stay there. And how did you get a date from one

07:01.981 --> 07:05.325
of those girls? Just by picking the name. Is that 
right? That's all, yeah. And sometimes did end up

07:11.373 --> 07:16.505
with a dull girl? Well, sometimes they would end up 
with a dull cadet. I'll tell you one experience I

07:22.980 --> 07:30.377
had in my freshman year, one of my seniors, Slim 
Neely, he had made arrangements with a date with a

07:30.357 --> 07:37.692
girl from TSCW.

07:37.712 --> 07:50.037
And he said, now Fish Kokonos, I want you to go down 
there and you ask for Betty, I forget her name, and

07:37.712 --> 07:50.037
if she's good looking you come back and tell me. 
She's not good looking. Tell her I had to leave this

07:50.978 --> 07:53.942
weekend and I wouldn't be here." So I went down 
there. A couple of us went down there. They had the

07:58.308 --> 08:00.310
same assignment. And we decided if we were good 
looking, we were going to come back and say, oh man,

08:01.131 --> 08:07.039
it was horrible. And then we'd go have a date with 
them. Because they didn't care. They just had a

08:10.924 --> 08:14.468
date with a cadet. So we had a lot of fun with that. 
Describe

08:16.831 --> 08:23.560
one of the big dances, say the artillery dance. 
Sabisa Hall, really nice. Little Jack Little was

08:27.665 --> 08:39.461
the orchestra and they played real good music and 
we danced and just had real good fun. Did you all

08:39.981 --> 08:41.944
decorate Sabisa? We did. The cadets did. I don't 
know who did. But it was decorated? I don't think. A

08:47.355 --> 08:48.979
couple of times it might have been. And how did the 
Aggies conduct themselves at a dance? I don't

08:54.270 --> 08:58.960
recall any bad instance of anything at a dance. And 
how were the girls treated? Oh, like ladies,

09:00.824 --> 09:03.848
really were. I don't recall anything that ever 
happened to a girl that we invited down. All right

09:14.700 --> 09:22.309
now when the dance was over, would they ever go 
anywhere after the No, because it was a curfew and

09:22.289 --> 09:27.998
we had to get them back and a lot of us didn't have 
cars to go anywhere. And we'd walk around the

09:28.639 --> 09:43.642
campus and explain to the girls this is ag, this is 
the wine, this is law and prayer, and this is

09:28.639 --> 09:43.642
Mitchell Hall and Bazell and we'd walk around the 
campus. Where did, if anybody wanted to get a drink

09:45.144 --> 09:48.730
then, where did they go? You mean alcohol?

09:53.423 --> 10:02.096
You know, I really don't know because I really 
didn't drink, didn't smoke, but we had Uncle Ed

09:53.423 --> 10:02.096
Hard Liquor. It was a nice club that people went to 
have beer with. But it was out here on the highway.

10:08.926 --> 10:10.448
You had to have a car to get out there. And Brian, you 
could ride the bus into Brian. Other than that. Now

10:20.239 --> 10:28.689
after the war, I know, went out toward Snook and 
immediately crossed the river with a place with

10:20.239 --> 10:28.689
the nickname Whiskey Bridge. Whiskey Bridge, 
that's right. Yeah, we had that too. We didn't name

10:33.475 --> 10:34.476
it that. I know what you're talking about. Did an 
Aggie ever bring some whiskey brack to the dorm?

10:44.487 --> 10:46.350
They did, but I never witnessed it. Isn't that 
funny? I never, in my dorm, the guys I ran with

10:47.431 --> 10:51.858
never. All right, you mentioned smoking. About 
how many, about what percentage of cadets smoked?

10:59.169 --> 11:00.771
It wasn't a big percent. I would say the ones I knew, 
in fact my roommate Bobby Woodham smoked. And I

11:07.321 --> 11:10.866
wouldn't, you know, we had a discussion about 
smoking in the room. I would say ten percent.

11:13.970 --> 11:14.531
That's all? That's all. And they're smoking 
cigarettes? Cigarettes, but a lot of them were

11:17.195 --> 11:19.860
tobacco chewers. They chewed tobacco then. No 
snuff? No snuff. Did some of them roll their own?

11:28.375 --> 11:28.956
They did. Yeah, I guess a few of them did. What about 
pipes? Bullderm.

11:35.767 --> 11:37.410
Not many pipes. Was it legal for them to smoke in the 
dorm? There was no ordinance on it. There was no

11:43.704 --> 11:44.946
rules. It was just consideration. But I don't 
recall smoking in a dorm, now that you mention it.

11:51.025 --> 11:55.452
Had you and your buddies even heard the words that 
we now hear about drugs? Did you even know what?

11:57.616 --> 11:58.538
Didn't know what it was about. Marijuana? Never 
heard of it. Cocaine? Didn't know what that's all

12:02.504 --> 12:03.907
about. Let's see. What about card games in the 
dorms? Oh, yeah. I never was a card player, but that

12:09.696 --> 12:13.202
went on. I mean some of them would play all night. 
Poker? Poker. Oh yeah, that went on. Dominoes? Not

12:22.988 --> 12:23.749
too much. Just poker. Maybe at the Y they played 
dominoes. Was some of the poker for money? Oh yeah,

12:29.539 --> 12:33.385
yeah. Let's see, we did dates and

12:34.715 --> 12:44.549
you didn't go to summer school here, ever? One 
semester. Oh, you did? I'm trying to remember. One

12:49.516 --> 12:52.040
six-week course I went here. How was that 
different? It wasn't much different, just less

12:53.762 --> 13:00.672
students, more time for recreation, more time for 
handball. Me and Manny Smith. And were there,

13:01.934 --> 13:04.820
there were some girls then? Oh yeah. There were 
girls then. But not much, not much. Went in and

13:10.731 --> 13:13.437
mingling and socializing. Because normally the 
guy would come to summer school. He had an

13:17.307 --> 13:19.634
objective he wanted to get out of the way. What did 
you and your friends do for recreation, for fun?

13:26.614 --> 13:27.135
Not much. Well, Saturday night, I take it back, we 
would go to Bryan. He'd go to the Dixie Cafe and have

13:32.174 --> 13:53.625
a sandwich or something or go to the Wooden Dairy 
Queen Inn, it was another name, have an ice cream

13:32.174 --> 13:53.625
cone and walk around Bryan and just stand on the 
corner and have a bowl session and about 11 o'clock

13:32.174 --> 13:53.625
come on back. And did you hitchhike down there? I 
had a bus running. Oh, okay. Where was the bus? At

14:00.183 --> 14:00.844
the Northgate? Northgate. And I'm always closing 
the Northgate. The upperclassman says, too cold,

14:05.531 --> 14:08.214
go close the Northgate. That's where Lipscomb 
Drugstore was. We used to go there a lot. hang

14:13.383 --> 14:14.666
around the drug store. Did they have a soda 
fountain? Oh yes, a soda fountain. What else was

14:19.415 --> 14:20.838
there at Northgate? Well, Harlech Boots Shop was 
there, Lucchese was there, Campus Clothing Store

14:21.259 --> 14:33.905
was there, a few hamburger joints. Campus 
Theater. Campus Theater, oh yeah.

14:40.594 --> 14:42.496
But it's not like it is now. Now,

14:44.719 --> 14:48.864
Lewpott was there. Did you ever get a loan from old 
Army Lew? No, sir. I never did. He said he never had a

14:55.412 --> 14:59.757
student that failed to pay off his loan. I believe 
it. That they were all honest. Let's see, do you

15:05.189 --> 15:11.356
remember when you bought your senior ring? I sure 
do. Describe that please. I had accumulated

15:15.380 --> 15:18.864
enough money to buy my ring. How much did it cost? I 
want to say $90. I don't have any idea. I want to say

15:27.393 --> 15:28.234
$90. I think they're $300 or $400 now. And my boots 
were about $100. I still got my boots. But when I got

15:39.729 --> 15:41.136
my Aggie ring, I put that thing on and I was so proud. 
I took it home and showed it to Papa and Mama and they

15:44.857 --> 15:47.860
were so proud. Of course, I already had two of them, 
Pete and Jimmy. But my boots. Wait, let's stay with

15:56.388 --> 15:57.649
the ring. Have you ever lost your ring? No, sir. 
Have you had any good ring stories? I sure do.

16:04.836 --> 16:05.957
Please share some of those. One of the finest ring 
stories happened to me during the Battle of the

16:10.141 --> 16:12.784
Bulge. On the third day, we were fighting the 
Germans. We were trying to push them out, trying to

16:16.087 --> 16:19.050
straighten the line out. I was a forward observer 
with the infantry, and I was going to move from one

16:19.410 --> 16:29.961
OP across the field to another OP, which I thought 
would give me a better line of sight. And as I got

16:30.722 --> 16:35.407
halfway, the Germans counterattacked with 
artillery and I hit the ground. And I'm laying flat

16:36.808 --> 16:38.730
on my face on the ground with my arms outstretched. 
Next thing I knew somebody had thrown his arm on top

16:42.951 --> 16:50.363
of my arm and I looked at it and he had an Aggie ring 
on. And I looked up and there was a colonel,

16:50.904 --> 16:53.448
Lieutenant Colonel. I said, Colonel, my name's 
Coconose, Mike Coconose. Lieutenant Kokonos,

16:58.606 --> 17:01.632
you got a brother named Pete?" I said, yes sir, I 
sure do. He and I are classmates, good friends, we

17:03.296 --> 17:06.943
had a lot of classes together. I said, Colonel, get 
us out of here. He said, I wish I could, I'd leave

17:08.947 --> 17:11.152
myself. But we sat and chatted for a few minutes and 
He was with the 94th Division. His name was Colonel

17:16.662 --> 17:18.986
Berry. And he was on his way back to his battalion 
when he saw me laying on the ground. And he saw my

17:25.616 --> 17:30.584
ring, so he says, I thought I'd have some fun and 
throw my arm on top of your ring. And I saw him about

17:31.506 --> 17:35.532
two years, three years after the The war here at A&M 
at a football game, he had a heart attack after that

17:36.271 --> 17:41.621
and died. But that was quite a story. Oh, that's 
special. Any other Ring stories? Not really,

17:47.994 --> 17:50.599
except for that. I don't believe I could top that.

17:55.168 --> 17:58.735
Why are Aggie Rings so special and so treasured? It 
stands for a great institution. That's one of the

18:01.065 --> 18:04.008
reasons I love the ring. And I look at it, mine's 
being worn down now because I never take it off

18:04.128 --> 18:10.695
except maybe play handball.

18:14.639 --> 18:22.408
But it's special because it stands for a great 
college, great people, and your comrades, your

18:14.639 --> 18:22.408
classmates. That's what it stands for. Now, you 
mentioned this comrade. What is it that builds

18:27.894 --> 18:32.159
that feeling of togetherness? What is it that 
makes Aggies so proud? They're proud because,

18:37.205 --> 18:40.048
first, they want to get an education. Secondly, 
when they come up here, and when I came up here, we

18:40.809 --> 18:47.397
all put on the same uniform together. We look 
alike. There's no difference. And I use Bum Bright

18:50.438 --> 18:53.304
as a perfect example. Bum Bright who? You've got 
the same khaki shirt I've got on, same brown shoes I

18:56.611 --> 19:01.200
have. And that way it equalizes everybody. And 
everybody shares the same relationship here at

19:04.966 --> 19:10.354
A&M. Heartaches or troubles or things or 
happiness that no other college has. It's unique.

19:20.329 --> 19:21.170
It's unique here. And are

19:22.572 --> 19:33.589
there certain experiences or events that are key 
to building that unity?

19:36.927 --> 19:41.013
Well the bonfire is a deal. We had bonfires. Yale 
practice,

19:42.895 --> 19:48.763
silver taps.

19:51.407 --> 19:51.988
Commencements? Commencements. Football games? 
Football games, standing up at every people. The

19:57.576 --> 20:00.640
public are amazed that we never sit down. Even in 
those days, go back to Beaumont and say you guys

20:01.008 --> 20:06.054
never sit down. As long as that team's out on the 
field we never sit down. We're ready to go in if they

20:09.478 --> 20:12.441
need us. And

20:12.461 --> 20:24.474
we don't, at that time we didn't worry about the 
academic standing of A&M. We knew it was a good

20:25.475 --> 20:27.758
school. And we wanted to make it better. And this 
cohesion we had as a student body, I think, helped

20:30.434 --> 20:40.303
the former student association find a sink that 
happened to A&M. In general, describe the student

20:41.163 --> 20:44.266
body when you were here. Where were they from? What 
kind of families? What kind of background? And

20:48.670 --> 20:50.111
what kind of attitudes? I smile when you say that, 
because I never heard of Dobine. I never heard of

20:54.435 --> 20:57.998
Snook.

20:58.197 --> 21:00.300
Round Rock, I never heard of all these places. 
Linden, I never heard of Linden. And all these guys

21:04.247 --> 21:07.912
coming in from different parts of the state of 
Texas. And you know what? They're just like me.

21:11.959 --> 21:13.161
That was so nice. They're no different than I am. 
And he might have been bigger and taller or shorter

21:16.045 --> 21:21.133
and fatter. But his attitude was the same as mine. 
Wasn't getting an education. And I never heard of

21:26.482 --> 21:29.206
Hearn. I never heard of Caldwell.

21:34.615 --> 21:37.019
So that's what makes A&M so unique. All right, 
senior boots. Where'd you buy them? Luke Casey.

21:43.349 --> 21:44.050
Still got them. Got them underneath my clothes 
rack when I come in from the office. I put my coat in

21:48.288 --> 21:49.509
there. There's my boots. And I keep them there 
because my grandchildren come in. I have 19 of

21:54.075 --> 21:55.296
them. And they come in, and they're now 7, 8, 9, 10, 
11, 12 years old. They want to put them on and walk

22:01.964 --> 22:04.087
through the house. So I let them walk through the 
house with my spurs and everything. How did you

22:07.591 --> 22:10.255
feel when you first put those boots on? Oh, top of 
the world. They did. Had a waist about 32 inches.

22:19.315 --> 22:23.081
Good shape, felt good, put on them boots, boot 
britches. Now, were you yet going steady with this

22:24.804 --> 22:29.212
young lady? No, that finally went by the waist. I 
really never went steady with any girl. Okay, so

22:35.482 --> 22:38.928
your future wife, you had not? Oh, no. I met her at 
church, and that's how we got married. Let's see,

22:45.708 --> 22:48.071
final review. Did y'all... Grig Feely, not the 
owner of Drill Field. Describe that, please. Oh,

22:54.137 --> 23:03.328
he just, well, made several of them, as you know, 
but my final review...

23:03.868 --> 23:04.729
This spring of 40? 43. 1943.

23:08.233 --> 23:11.817
And it was kind of sad. because we knew everybody 
was going to go a different direction. Normally,

23:16.450 --> 23:28.486
when you graduate from college, you keep in touch 
with your classmates, but in this situation, we

23:16.450 --> 23:28.486
knew we were all going different directions and 
didn't know when we'd see each other again. It was

23:29.146 --> 23:30.748
very touching. Do you remember who the reviewing 
officer was? I don't remember. The commandant

23:36.416 --> 23:39.019
here was Colonel Welty. He was tough. Ooh, he was 
tough. Who came up for your final review and

23:43.484 --> 23:46.850
commencement from your family? I don't think 
anybody come up. Mom and dad didn't come? Mama

23:51.778 --> 23:53.341
couldn't come up. Papa couldn't come up. They 
couldn't come up. First place didn't have the

23:57.708 --> 24:01.435
transportation to get them up here. And my brother 
Pete was in Bay City. and he couldn't come. Jimmy

24:06.832 --> 24:12.888
was on his way to Australia and Andrew was already 
here. Now did you already have orders to report for

24:14.030 --> 24:17.479
active duty? Not at that time. Not at that time? I 
had a unique situation. I applied to medical

24:23.437 --> 24:38.330
school and the military told me here, Colonel 
Welty said, okay, you will delay your entry until

24:23.437 --> 24:38.330
you're here from medical school in May. My class 
left in December, I mean the first part of

24:39.391 --> 24:45.657
February, 43. They went en masse to OCS. Well, May 
came and I wasn't accepted to medical school, so I

24:49.520 --> 24:57.408
was told that I would have to go to the Army, and I 
said, okay. I said, I'll go to OCS like my

24:58.028 --> 25:03.053
classmates.

25:05.515 --> 25:08.198
They did not allow that for me. I had to go to basic 
training. Oh. Fourteen weeks. Oh. Colonel Welch

25:13.243 --> 25:15.645
would not turn loose my papers. He went, of course, 
I didn't go in February. I said, well, sir, you told

25:21.054 --> 25:22.357
me. You're the one that told me I could delay. Well, 
I made a mistake or something. OK. So I was called in

25:30.234 --> 25:32.318
and went to basic training. then went to OCS. I went 
with, I went to OCS with a class of 44 and 45. They

25:40.324 --> 25:44.469
were called up, sent back to A&M, then went to, so it 
was all that. Now this is Fort Sill? Fort Sill,

25:45.830 --> 25:46.931
Oklahoma. I went to OCS there. In the summer of 43? 
43, that's right. As you... Incidentally, Fort

25:53.279 --> 25:57.023
Sill Put me in the Hall of Fame. They have a Hall of 
Fame for their officers. Very good. Because I went

26:02.470 --> 26:06.897
in as a basic trainee and come out as a general. They 
like that.

26:12.364 --> 26:19.434
As you look back, what did you learn here that's 
been important and significant, important in

26:12.364 --> 26:19.434
your life?

26:22.738 --> 26:24.040
What did A&M teach you?

26:27.142 --> 26:38.874
I never really asked that particular question, 
but A&M, I'll start off by saying without A&M, I

26:27.142 --> 26:38.874
don't know where I'd be. I had no idea. But A&M set me 
in the right direction of what I wanted to do and how

26:40.136 --> 26:51.968
to do it in a dedicated, honest, with integrity way 
of doing things in life. And that's what A&M, to me,

26:54.822 --> 26:58.709
set me on that course. I could have been a 
politician, I could have been a vet, I could have

26:59.330 --> 27:14.715
been a doctor, I could have been an engineer, I 
could have been anything, but it told me this is how

26:59.330 --> 27:14.715
you do it and do it in the right way. had that with 
Papa and Mama at home. Discipline, honesty. But

27:20.558 --> 27:21.720
this reinforced it. This reinforced it, that's 
correct. And how was that done and what methods

27:23.364 --> 27:30.279
were those values perpetuated here? Well, the 
funny thing is I moved up from sophomore to

27:35.570 --> 27:41.827
junior-senior, I counseled a lot of freshmen in my 
battery. And I watched them and I could see they

27:41.847 --> 27:50.710
were being troubled by certain things and I would 
visit with them. And A&M helped me to counsel with

27:50.690 --> 27:56.857
them, and A&M helped me to try to help them. 
Actually,

27:57.938 --> 28:04.987
you can't really put your finger on what A&M does 
for you. Just do it. Did you become an officer in the

28:06.789 --> 28:08.331
Corps? Yes, I was a second lieutenant on H Battery. 
And what were your responsibilities there? Well,

28:16.475 --> 28:22.590
to just work with the battery personnel, 
counseling. That's probably the biggest one. And

28:27.161 --> 28:33.235
I'm trying to remember some direct duties I had, 
but I just I was an H battery officer. As you look

28:37.422 --> 28:54.753
back over those years, if all the people that had 
been helpful to you were available today for you

28:37.422 --> 28:54.753
personally to express your appreciation to them, 
to whom would you most want to say words of

28:37.422 --> 28:54.753
appreciation and why? Your A&M years.

29:01.295 --> 29:04.261
Talking about cadets, or are you talking about 
anybody? Anybody. Cadets, teachers, advisers.

29:08.069 --> 29:14.341
Well I think one of the dominating persons in my 
life was Barney Corot, my basketball coach.

29:15.343 --> 29:16.065
Really liked him. And Colonel Elwood. What did you 
learn from those people? I learned to do the best

29:23.148 --> 29:27.177
job I was possibly I could do. That's what I learned 
from Corot. As short as I was in basketball, he gave

29:29.804 --> 29:37.802
me the opportunity to compete against the tall 
guys, the best guys, and stuff like that. And

29:39.727 --> 29:41.511
Colonel Elwood instilled in me the military 
discipline that I needed to carry on in the war and

29:41.491 --> 29:53.616
in my military career along with that. Who else?

30:01.083 --> 30:06.790
I'm just, oh, there were so many guys that, there 
were really... Some teachers, some friends?

30:09.313 --> 30:22.990
Teachers, well, Dr. Hick felt, I mentioned his 
name before, but after that it became, I realized

30:09.313 --> 30:22.990
everything fell on me. as an individual that I 
better not depend on anybody, but I could go get

30:23.189 --> 30:29.956
counseling if I needed it.

30:36.824 --> 30:49.257
If you could be a consultant to A&M today, to the 
leadership, what advice would you give them about

30:36.824 --> 30:49.257
A&M's future? What would you advise them to do in 
the future? to make A&M become whatever it is you

30:53.108 --> 30:56.451
think it ought to be.

31:00.154 --> 31:03.698
That's a very challenging statement you're 
making. I think the management, and that's

31:06.240 --> 31:19.132
President Boyne and them and the board, need to 
really get down in touch with the former students

31:06.240 --> 31:19.132
more. I think the student body is okay.
