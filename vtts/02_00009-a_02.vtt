00:01.870 --> 00:28.958
The public opinions of the high school students was that AMM was just an agriculture college and they had some engineering, but it wasn't really the place that the leading high school students wanted to go.

00:29.191 --> 00:34.399
They always had the portfolio of Vice President of Public Relations.

00:34.419 --> 00:40.788
And this chapter solved, we were all really upset.

00:40.808 --> 00:52.765
So, the Association, on a big act of faith, commissioned a study to be done by a public relation.

00:52.925 --> 00:54.908
I said, I can't do the name right now.

00:54.928 --> 00:56.110
I thought it didn't take a lot of it to get it.

00:56.478 --> 00:59.843
But was involved in that.

01:00.063 --> 01:13.122
But our board was the study to determine the A&M's perception by the public.

01:13.162 --> 01:17.909
This was done before it came in and it was negative.

01:17.929 --> 01:19.912
It was very negative.

01:19.932 --> 01:25.320
I remember that I was one of the two people that had to take that to the board for reasons.

01:26.431 --> 01:38.924
I remember Mr. Peterson, maybe he was president of the board at that time, but he had, I'll just mention him because he was in the middle of it.

01:38.964 --> 01:42.328
I think he said something, there's no way you can make me believe all this.

01:43.148 --> 01:44.430
Yes.

01:45.991 --> 01:52.438
The report, actually the report was right on when it was completely accurate in the way the people felt about aliens.

01:53.802 --> 02:01.472
And the association undertook to do whatever it could to get away from that.

02:02.153 --> 02:03.154
I'll give you a little example.

02:04.216 --> 02:16.432
My son, Ken, was one of the followers on one of the basketball teams that was a power in Texas, high school basketball.

02:16.472 --> 02:20.637
They were playing in the regionals.

02:22.253 --> 02:31.083
There were a lot of leading dealers there, and they played that morning, and they were going to play in the finals, I think, that evening.

02:32.685 --> 02:36.188
And they said, Mr. Apfel, we know that you like A&M and all.

02:37.250 --> 02:38.731
Show us something there.

02:38.751 --> 02:39.492
It was Saturday.

02:40.834 --> 02:41.835
That place was a bar.

02:43.637 --> 02:49.724
The only thing I could find of interest to show them was a Mexican gun collection.

02:49.744 --> 02:50.504
In the MFC.

02:50.865 --> 02:51.045
Yeah.

02:52.645 --> 03:03.596
At that time, I vowed that somehow, someway, on that campus, we wanted a place where people could go and find out what ain't ever found.

03:03.976 --> 03:10.443
And that was the thing that shocked me into wanting to see that we had a visitor center.

03:11.584 --> 03:11.704
Right.

03:11.724 --> 03:16.109
So you're saying that's where the Appell Visitor Center idea was born?

03:16.229 --> 03:16.910
Absolutely.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.092
And that would have been about what year?

03:19.412 --> 03:22.315
That had been in...

03:23.830 --> 03:26.854
Probably the late 60s.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.778
It just took a long time to get around to that.

03:29.798 --> 03:31.380
I think we got it going.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.122
You know, we finally got it.

03:33.142 --> 03:43.836
With the rudder tower and the rudder tower there, that was a key thing.

03:44.136 --> 03:48.522
Alright, with that center, when the rudder tower is being planned,

03:48.991 --> 03:53.996
Did you step forward and say, I want to do the center, or did somebody come to you to ask for it?

03:55.218 --> 04:02.285
We had an association lobby for getting that space in the center.

04:02.305 --> 04:05.108
And it was a close call.

04:05.168 --> 04:08.111
Fort Albrecht was on board at that time.

04:08.131 --> 04:10.193
And Ford had the flu.

04:10.213 --> 04:13.217
And I remember Buck Wires called Ford.

04:13.237 --> 04:17.361
He said, Ford, if you don't get over there and support this, we're not going to be able to get this.

04:17.729 --> 04:25.965
information center and that's what we call it in the run of town.

04:25.985 --> 04:35.183
Because a lot of the board members are lukewarm, they don't understand what we're doing and that's a prime space and they just don't know where this is worth it.

04:35.203 --> 04:40.193
And Ford got up out there and went to where we prevailed and they gave us the space.

04:40.730 --> 05:01.981
And then we raised money from various friends of A&M, including the West Foundation and others that I had connections to.

05:02.001 --> 05:03.463
And we were able to get the appointed committee, which Bob Ladd moved on.

05:04.034 --> 05:16.713
I think you need to find out what that committee was there, because they were a whole bunch of really dedicated people that worked on all that.

05:16.733 --> 05:30.413
One of my favorite recollections was a few years after the Appelt Center opened, there was one little bit was interviewing, and I think it was a student from Indonesia,

05:31.760 --> 05:36.767
And he said, the Aggie spirit, it is a good thing, I think.

05:38.550 --> 05:43.397
And you could tell that he wasn't convinced completely about all of it.

05:43.417 --> 05:45.400
But see, it worked.

05:46.101 --> 05:50.408
We started out in time with the full map.

05:50.648 --> 05:55.696
And we had now, we had the little cassettes and all that.

05:55.716 --> 05:57.037
But it gave a lot of information.

05:57.098 --> 05:58.019
And it was used.

05:58.039 --> 05:59.421
It was used heavily.

05:59.806 --> 06:03.730
Every day when I go through there, I see people in there.

06:04.211 --> 06:13.500
But then in the early 90s is when we decided to really do it professionally.

06:13.520 --> 06:19.046
And actually it's one of the things I believe about.

06:19.066 --> 06:25.232
But it started back then.

06:25.252 --> 06:28.075
After this report,

06:28.713 --> 06:32.639
association in this high school relations.

06:32.659 --> 06:36.805
We started bringing people from the campus to the high schools.

06:37.486 --> 06:46.419
And in this way, I don't really understand how perception kept changing.

06:46.519 --> 06:51.526
But we're now, perception is that AMM is a place to go to.

06:52.628 --> 06:54.130
And that's a dramatic

06:54.397 --> 06:55.498
Thirty year change.

06:55.518 --> 06:56.199
Oh yes.

06:56.219 --> 06:57.981
1968 to 98.

06:59.262 --> 07:02.125
Believe me, I can't think of anything that's more changed.

07:05.348 --> 07:08.892
Anybody tells you a naked joke is tongue in cheek now.

07:10.914 --> 07:13.877
At 68 they believed it.

07:14.498 --> 07:16.040
Very true.

07:16.060 --> 07:16.680
Very true.

07:16.700 --> 07:22.607
Had you heard of Dr. Williams before his appointment as president was announced?

07:23.027 --> 07:23.087
No.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.616
Do you remember your first impressions of him?

07:29.439 --> 07:37.769
I think he was, see he came on board I think the year that I was on the field.

07:38.269 --> 07:51.505
I used to have a hand and then duck him and I had to make a little talk and all, but I became a fan of Dr. Williams on the committee.

07:52.075 --> 08:00.503
his personality and his vision for the one who's A&M appealed to him.

08:01.184 --> 08:07.270
As you were working for A&M's Progress, who were your key allies?

08:08.411 --> 08:09.392
Oh, there were so many.

08:09.812 --> 08:14.136
But who were, name some of them.

08:15.097 --> 08:19.502
I'd say everybody that was on the association boards for all the few years.

08:20.262 --> 08:21.964
Everyone that was on the foundation.

08:22.501 --> 08:30.231
the board after we got rid of the last 10 year deals was audit.

08:30.852 --> 08:49.515
I recall we had a meeting, the first meeting after I'd been elected chair foundation.

08:49.535 --> 08:51.057
We had seven trustees and they were, maybe it was five trustees.

08:51.475 --> 09:06.916
that were served in 10 year terms.

09:06.936 --> 09:09.439
And three of them showed up.

09:09.459 --> 09:14.846
And some of them still tell you that I got on the phone and told them, okay, this is serious business.

09:14.866 --> 09:19.272
If you don't think enough of this job and what we need to do here, and can't make the meetings through the University of Africa and stuff.

09:20.180 --> 09:24.487
And after that I had another absence.

09:24.507 --> 09:26.970
Oh good, good.

09:27.291 --> 09:29.915
Where was the foundation located physically?

09:30.917 --> 09:32.058
Where were its offices?

09:35.143 --> 09:38.188
Various places, the University gave a space.

09:38.368 --> 09:42.895
In the MSC, near the association on the west side of the MSC?

09:44.017 --> 09:46.761
I think that's one of the places.

09:47.045 --> 09:50.670
Then it was in the library building for a while.

09:51.672 --> 09:58.121
It took a while before you got a permanent location.

09:58.642 --> 10:04.471
In working with Dr. Williams, do you remember any other significant campaigns?

10:07.856 --> 10:16.208
I was mostly concerned in that period of foundational activities.

10:16.610 --> 10:34.856
really spent all my interests as far as ADM on the World of the Foundation Architects.

10:34.876 --> 10:36.578
And Dr. William was always very cooperative.

10:36.598 --> 10:39.342
And Bob Walker, as vice president there, was really appropriate.

10:39.362 --> 10:42.606
He worked very closely with the Foundation.

10:42.626 --> 10:45.891
And had he been trying to build his own empire, so to speak,

10:46.597 --> 10:56.869
and all, a lot of the donations that came to the foundation would very well have been going over to the university.

10:56.889 --> 11:12.267
So, and all during this period, we had a very touchable relationship with the regents.

11:12.820 --> 11:17.765
working with the regents, show them what we thought the foundation was going to be.

11:17.785 --> 11:19.266
They could see the money rolling in.

11:20.007 --> 11:26.473
And you always had that little situation there.

11:26.973 --> 11:28.514
Gosh, all this money's coming in here.

11:29.135 --> 11:33.319
And some of the regents said, but we don't control it.

11:33.339 --> 11:39.304
And there was a period in there where it was kind of dicey.

11:39.765 --> 11:42.287
The regents at one time even established

11:42.554 --> 11:52.327
a separate foundation, but it was supported by the association of law students.

11:52.347 --> 11:56.954
The biggest thing we had with that foundation, it was a child of the association.

11:56.974 --> 12:04.604
The directors, all the trustees were supported by the association, and there was tight working there.

12:04.624 --> 12:12.375
We had lots of negotiations saying, now what is the function of the association, that's against the foundation.

12:12.912 --> 12:21.365
Well, we decided that the association would be more than looking at the angel gifts.

12:23.108 --> 12:35.427
The foundation would be more looking at the one-time lifetime type gifts, requests, wills.

12:36.065 --> 12:39.170
That type of thing.

12:39.190 --> 12:40.692
And it's working like that to this day.

12:41.633 --> 12:52.209
It's just the association is possible, the foundation is possible, and between them, they're strong.

12:52.229 --> 13:05.869
We've got a tremendously strong former students association, and we now have developed a very, very good foundation, good leadership, dedicated trustees,

13:06.237 --> 13:14.307
I don't know just when, but the foundation will have a billion dollars in it in the next few years.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.149
Probably not over five years, I don't know.

13:16.169 --> 13:16.690
I think you're right.

13:17.071 --> 13:25.401
And I see that the working relationship between the foundation and the university... Boy, the regents, it's good now.

13:25.521 --> 13:25.962
It's good.

13:26.242 --> 13:26.823
It's very good.

13:26.843 --> 13:29.626
Between Eddie Joe and Walker is good.

13:30.407 --> 13:31.529
There's no jealousy.

13:31.589 --> 13:34.152
There's no territorial argument.

13:34.469 --> 13:36.391
And you gotta give Bob Walker a lot of credit for that.

13:36.411 --> 13:37.112
Oh yes, oh yes.

13:37.932 --> 13:45.700
And the morale of the foundation staff from the lowest to the highest is really good.

13:45.720 --> 13:52.907
Well, you know, that is demonstrated by the fact that the foundation staff made substantial contribution.

13:52.927 --> 13:53.227
Yes.

13:53.627 --> 13:57.952
Into the next drive.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.455
I'm not gonna ask the negative now,

14:01.790 --> 14:09.918
who were the regents during your period, who were the regents that you think deserve the most positive credit?

14:18.066 --> 14:22.491
As far as support of the foundation, that's where I was working.

14:22.511 --> 14:22.891
Okay.

14:23.011 --> 14:30.919
Well, I thought that they invested in

14:31.608 --> 14:36.961
You know, we're doing this period there.

14:36.981 --> 14:40.590
We've got the private... Enterprise.

14:40.610 --> 14:41.192
Enterprise research.

14:41.613 --> 14:47.828
And in that room, for instance, Joe Reynolds was exploring that.

14:48.652 --> 15:02.239
We had a lot of people that perceived the light, seeing what the possibilities were.

15:02.259 --> 15:09.293
I guess the only thing there was some lack of enthusiasm,

15:09.627 --> 15:30.056
part of some of the administration people, when they saw the Foundation of Mass and all this money, that they felt maybe I'd be right about every other, it'd be the worst of them.

15:30.076 --> 15:32.058
But they didn't realize that a lot of these donors did not have given it to the university.

15:32.078 --> 15:34.622
The fact that they could give it to any member of the Foundation really appealed to them.

15:36.003 --> 15:41.250
and they felt it would be better administrative and the best and better.

15:41.270 --> 15:44.535
And I think time has shown it, that's true.

15:44.555 --> 15:53.627
When you were working closely with Dr. Williams, did you work with John Calhoun, John Coldus, any of those people?

15:53.647 --> 15:55.209
Yeah, sure, all of those.

15:55.229 --> 15:57.593
It was all very positive people.

15:57.613 --> 15:59.716
Calhoun was strength.

16:00.156 --> 16:05.183
Coldus was absolutely one of a kind for his job.

16:06.125 --> 16:10.650
He's just about as good as I've ever been around in that student affairs job.

16:12.633 --> 16:23.125
Really, see a lot of that had so much to do with the, so we might say the new perception of AMF, people with that kind of strength.

16:24.807 --> 16:33.378
Now from Hervey to Wyrus, what kind of transition was that in the leadership of the foundation?

16:33.818 --> 16:35.220
Was that a smooth transition?

16:35.420 --> 16:36.461
Well, that went very easy.

16:36.942 --> 16:37.783
That went very easy.

16:38.865 --> 16:47.136
And then from- See, Herbie, Herbie, Herbie inherited the portfolio from, I think, there.

16:49.759 --> 17:03.358
Buck came at a time when, I guess, the Foundation, I mean, the Economic Association, the director started doing life, you know.

17:03.378 --> 17:04.920
And it was a result of,

17:06.773 --> 17:23.049
A lot of this study of the attitudes toward it again, perceptions, you know.

17:23.069 --> 17:24.693
And when we saw I made it to anywhere, there's some galvanized association board.

17:24.713 --> 17:25.234
We'd have to do something.

17:25.254 --> 17:25.795
We'd have to change things.

17:27.226 --> 17:28.908
We didn't know what to do.

17:28.928 --> 17:32.772
And actually different things were done and so happened.

17:33.112 --> 17:39.959
I don't know what finally caused the change in perception, but it did happen.

17:40.759 --> 17:48.147
What was the attitude of the typical A&M former student about racial integration at A&M?

17:50.629 --> 17:53.352
I didn't see any good opposition to that.

17:56.302 --> 17:57.604
I certainly had none.

17:58.024 --> 17:59.546
I really didn't see any opposition to that.

18:00.347 --> 18:06.034
Do you remember any action proposed by the association to oppose it?

18:07.536 --> 18:07.856
I don't.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.642
Nothing, certainly nothing of record.

18:12.722 --> 18:26.038
It might have been some individuals in the association that didn't like it, but the association, I feel that you got sales come out on affirmatively.

18:26.660 --> 18:30.244
Push forward.

18:31.325 --> 18:44.180
Were you by chance present at the association board meeting when Mr. Rudder came and asked them to endorse co-education and non-compulsory core?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.781
John Lindsay was the president.

18:46.042 --> 18:46.622
He's the president.

18:46.642 --> 18:48.404
Because Jack Creighton had moved up.

18:48.424 --> 18:50.126
Yeah.

18:50.146 --> 18:51.868
I was not on the board then.

18:51.888 --> 18:54.371
That's the point I was on the board.

18:54.391 --> 18:56.093
I was following up there.

18:56.461 --> 19:00.607
John can give you some very interesting real on that.

19:01.729 --> 19:11.464
He had to run that through, and so to speak, he had to run it through the month.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.587
John can give you some really interesting real on that.

19:13.607 --> 19:23.802
Alright, during your period of leadership with the association and the foundation, what statewide political figures

19:24.575 --> 19:27.178
do you recall that deserve a pat on the back?

19:28.620 --> 19:35.489
Were there governors and senators and members of the house that were helpful to A&M?

19:35.509 --> 19:43.078
Of course, all the members from around this county, particularly the then senator, were very, very helpful.

19:43.298 --> 19:43.899
What senator?

19:48.365 --> 19:49.226
I can't think of his name.

19:49.326 --> 19:49.907
Bill Moore?

19:50.067 --> 19:51.288
Bill Moore.

19:51.308 --> 19:54.312
Bill Moore had a lot of lots of

19:57.025 --> 20:03.532
lots of heft in the legislature.

20:04.613 --> 20:09.078
And he was strong.

20:09.098 --> 20:17.908
And all the representatives of that area, there were a lot of them out of Houston and San Antonio and all.

20:17.948 --> 20:20.911
NM had good pull in the legislature.

20:21.852 --> 20:24.315
I think a lot of that is attributable to the fact that we had the Extension Service.

20:26.573 --> 20:31.560
I don't think a lot of people realize how effective that was.

20:33.463 --> 20:34.505
Because we were everywhere.

20:36.347 --> 20:40.754
And we were able to get to Mexico's.

20:40.774 --> 20:48.846
Extension services, some of the things we were doing were invulgate, change the image.

20:48.866 --> 20:52.551
A lot of that was invulgated through this network extension.

20:52.972 --> 20:55.315
That's something we have as an advantage.

20:55.818 --> 20:59.722
as it relates to immunity.

20:59.842 --> 21:03.905
It puts us in every way.

21:03.925 --> 21:10.051
We're the only one that has a local person operating in every county.

21:11.272 --> 21:13.594
And in some cases, both a man and a woman.

21:13.855 --> 21:23.023
So that was something that was quite effective as we started

21:23.830 --> 21:32.119
putting out the materials and trying to change the perception and all, that was a great help.

21:33.340 --> 21:37.945
Do you remember when you heard that Dr. Williams had had a heart attack?

21:37.965 --> 21:38.766
I sure did.

21:38.786 --> 21:46.694
Describe that please, how you heard and- Well, it was an office in Houston when they told me I was devastated.

21:46.714 --> 21:47.655
Did someone call you?

21:48.036 --> 21:50.418
Yes.

21:50.458 --> 21:51.880
I didn't recall who it was or something like that.

21:52.636 --> 21:56.883
Did they give him, as you understood it, was he going to survive?

21:56.943 --> 22:03.453
As far as I recall, it was a very touching building there for a moment.

22:03.473 --> 22:08.120
And that was a very awkward period.

22:10.905 --> 22:14.931
I won't put anything, but I think the regents could have handled that situation now.

22:17.948 --> 22:23.995
without knowing who I'm talking about really.

22:24.015 --> 22:34.787
But I don't even recall the reason why it was not hammered very well enough.

22:34.887 --> 22:41.934
As far as you know, were there any regents that had become opposed to Dr. Williams?

22:41.954 --> 22:42.976
I didn't perceive that.

22:44.437 --> 22:46.099
At least they didn't take an open.

22:46.703 --> 22:49.106
posture of an opposition.

22:50.027 --> 22:59.437
As far as you know, why did they recreate the system bureaucracy and recreate the office of chancellor?

23:01.159 --> 23:03.702
Because Mr. Rudder and Dr. Williams had been both.

23:03.902 --> 23:13.453
Well, of course Earl was such a dominant person out there that it was obvious that he was going to be

23:18.293 --> 23:27.965
When Williams came, that had been done for so many years that it was, they just didn't, see.

23:27.985 --> 23:34.813
Then after we, then they started having a little bit of international warfare, if you please.

23:35.013 --> 23:40.640
And they ended up with the chancellor, president, assistant.

23:41.481 --> 23:44.284
And it probably was the best way to do it.

23:46.137 --> 23:58.472
8th was flagship because they needed to go to the system and the system was not going to function that well without 8th leadership.

23:58.492 --> 24:11.828
And that's going to continue to be a little area depending on the personalities of the people who are in those offices.

24:11.848 --> 24:14.271
Which governors, in your experience,

24:15.297 --> 24:19.041
have been the most supportive of higher education and of A&M?

24:19.061 --> 24:43.887
I think Bill Pemmiss was a good supporter of higher education.

24:45.503 --> 24:46.524
What about John Conley?

24:47.526 --> 24:53.434
John Conley was.

24:53.454 --> 25:03.669
I don't recall if there had any government come out and say anything negative about A&M, but that's too bad a politics.

25:03.689 --> 25:11.460
Do you remember any examples of UT-A&M cooperation at the statewide level?

25:11.693 --> 25:35.699
I've attended many sessions, three or four at least, every time I was in Asia.

25:35.720 --> 25:38.743
And we'll go to Austin, we'll go to Texas, and we'll go through this, and say, okay, we're going to have a different puff here, we're going to do that.

25:38.763 --> 25:39.904
That's been going on, and we've got to continue to go on.

25:39.924 --> 25:40.705
If we're going to be successful,

25:41.343 --> 25:45.208
and protect them.

25:45.229 --> 26:05.077
I remember one time being in Dr. Williams' office, and he got a call from Peter Flan, or Mickey LeMater, one or the other, and they needed the votes of two Houston legislators, and Dr. Williams asked me to call John Lindsay and see if he knew either one of those two.

26:06.078 --> 26:10.945
Well, he knew them both and served on committees with both, and

26:11.313 --> 26:20.710
Those two folks then voted the way we wanted them to, and that swung the vote in the legislature.

26:22.833 --> 26:32.190
We all were busy working on people that were here in our local areas, talking about that business.

26:32.727 --> 26:48.532
That was conducted very well and it still works.

26:49.313 --> 26:59.629
Looking back on these 30 years and more now of activity, what were your proudest moments

27:00.807 --> 27:03.329
as a former student leader?

27:09.575 --> 27:20.986
There was a lot of, I don't know that I can't.

27:21.006 --> 27:28.713
I was just, I was absolutely proud of the Cleveland Foundation.

27:28.733 --> 27:29.734
Exceeded the gold, over a hundred million dollars.

27:30.524 --> 27:49.648
set a pattern that's going to be very difficult for the body to meet.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.772
I've always had the idea that President Burdolph University signed that everybody is going to go out to California.

27:52.792 --> 27:58.759
They have to lead a drive to exceed that.

27:59.330 --> 28:02.282
They will, and they will exceed.

28:02.302 --> 28:08.125
But they've stumbled now for three years trying to get going.

28:08.392 --> 28:30.255
I think that's one of the critical things that happened when everybody got there.

28:30.275 --> 28:31.717
It took a while to explain the thing that got solidly behind that drive.

28:31.737 --> 28:34.720
And it's one of the things, I think, that had the most cooperation with anything I've seen back in the 80s in this last drive when I kept performing.

28:35.088 --> 28:39.695
What I like about something like that, it goes on.

28:39.715 --> 28:52.773
The level of contributions from the two years before the capital fund in the annual to the two years now after the capital fund, compare those.

28:52.793 --> 29:02.547
But the difference is largely because of the activity and the contacts that were made during the capital fund drive.

29:03.100 --> 29:14.055
I believe this last year was the Foundation's best year yet.

29:14.542 --> 29:29.636
Well, that's, in my opinion, is a trading-age benefit of doing that and, of course, staffing up, getting more in front of people, having more people out there to look at.

29:29.656 --> 29:31.378
That's one thing you have.

29:31.398 --> 29:32.359
You have more and more people to work with.

29:32.519 --> 29:40.667
Every year that goes by, there's a new group of affluent agents upon.

29:41.137 --> 29:50.029
then the people who moved up in their career and finally they get in the top levels.

29:50.049 --> 29:58.340
Well, the numbers that are doing that now are so much greater than they were back in the 60s.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.061
Just a few top level people.

29:59.522 --> 30:01.785
We had people in the president of the Gulf and the president.

30:01.805 --> 30:09.355
But now it's spread all around the great positions of authority and prestige all across the country.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.718
And they get to do more and more and more.

30:12.738 --> 30:20.666
See, people in the 60s now are the guys that are coming into leadership.

30:21.147 --> 30:22.708
And it amazes me.

30:22.728 --> 30:26.352
I read the papers, look at the contributions to the foundation.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.715
Who the hell is this guy?

30:28.735 --> 30:29.075
See?

30:30.536 --> 30:31.698
And I go back and look.

30:31.718 --> 30:35.702
And he has an illustrious business career.

30:35.722 --> 30:38.785
As we look at the student body today,

30:39.322 --> 30:43.166
It's almost 50% female.

30:45.047 --> 30:54.376
It must be 80% non-core.

30:56.478 --> 31:02.704
Do you see any change in the spirit, in the enthusiasm, in the pride?

31:02.744 --> 31:08.890
That's one of the things you asked me that I got the biggest kick out with that.

31:09.578 --> 31:16.484
because I kept saying, I kept thinking about the speech made in Houston and said, I think it would be a good thing.

31:16.504 --> 31:21.649
But I had some, some of those reservations as to whether the girls would make good eggs.

31:22.650 --> 31:28.476
But I don't have any reservations about that anymore.

31:28.516 --> 31:32.860
The fact is, to use the expression, some of those girls would kill the bunch of girls.

31:32.880 --> 31:38.405
The guys, as far as being good eggs.

31:38.425 --> 31:38.725
So, and

31:39.835 --> 31:41.104
Saturday on that party.
