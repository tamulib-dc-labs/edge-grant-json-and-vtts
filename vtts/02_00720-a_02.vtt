WEBVTT

00:04.233 --> 00:05.855
Okay, the captain of the team. And we're talking 
about, what are we talking about now, the captain?

00:11.260 --> 00:15.684
Yeah, he was the captain of that company. Oh, okay, 
the captain of that company. And the president of

00:18.988 --> 00:20.509
the class. I'm not going to call their names. And 
the president of the class now had those people

00:25.014 --> 00:32.181
come back here wearing a badge. we like Frank. This 
is twenty years later see. They changed a lot in

00:38.432 --> 00:40.235
twenty years. They mature a little bit.

00:46.705 --> 00:51.392
Now we'll take a little, just on the board paddling 
I'll do that. Well let's wait because we're going

00:51.412 --> 00:57.021
to, was that another one of the problems when you 
were commandant? What did you try to do when you

00:58.587 --> 01:01.850
were commandant? Well, yes, yes. Now, for...

01:07.376 --> 01:12.242
I, as chairman of the, the commandant is chairman 
of the discipline committee.

01:16.506 --> 01:22.453
I didn't want, I didn't give that discipline 
committee a chance to fire anybody. The law would

01:23.333 --> 01:26.637
fire somebody if he, If he was tasing, they didn't 
allow that. Legislature didn't allow that.

01:30.887 --> 01:31.227
Right. But I had to, in order to get them to give that 
up, I had to get pretty tough. One old boy, I

01:44.944 --> 01:48.829
remember he was a junior. He threw his own captain 
into the fish tank out here at the class picnic, and

01:49.670 --> 01:56.218
he was the meanest man in school with a paddle.

01:59.135 --> 02:03.861
Well, I told those people, you don't have to take 
abuse. You don't have to tell me who you are. But if

02:09.147 --> 02:15.014
you've got something that you want me to know, you 
can just drop me a line and tell me about it. This old

02:17.937 --> 02:21.582
boy was a junior now. He was real tough.

02:27.653 --> 02:31.317
I went to his place and I said, I want to see you in 
your trunk. He got his paddle out. It had so many

02:34.861 --> 02:36.663
notches on it. I said, you have done, you just got 
through throwing your own captain into the fish

02:37.844 --> 02:43.209
tank. You're a mean, big, tough guy that 
somebody's going to straighten you out. And I'm

02:52.599 --> 02:54.201
the guy to do it. You people are roughed up and mean 
tough but I'm tougher than any of you. You're going

03:01.808 --> 03:05.994
to move out of your outfit and you're going to live 
in Devil's Island. There was an old piece of a

03:06.014 --> 03:19.111
dormitory down yonder that the married 
professors used to live in but then when they

03:06.014 --> 03:19.111
abandoned that thing they just left it down there. 
It still had lights in it. I guess it had a few old

03:22.092 --> 03:26.896
beds or something. Now I said, boy, you're going to 
move out to Devil's Island. Now you can either do

03:33.342 --> 03:40.769
that or you're going to be shipped from A&M College 
because you've been mean as a son of a bitch. Now,

03:42.391 --> 03:45.453
what you want to do? You want to go move to Devil's 
Island or you want to leave school? Well, he went to

03:49.037 --> 03:50.378
Devil's Island. I didn't hurt him. That didn't 
embarrass his parents.

03:59.222 --> 04:03.567
I told you the same thing I did to these boys that 
carried these things out. I told you about the

04:05.850 --> 04:13.179
no toilet paper on the train. We went up to Fort 
Worth. That was the first court trip. I told you

04:17.825 --> 04:18.846
about that. I did. Well, I won't go into that 
anymore. I thought I didn't know for sure. Why did

04:26.748 --> 04:32.813
you resign in 1937 as Commandant? Well, they 
threatened to strike

04:34.474 --> 04:45.324
and of course the board of directors had to begin to 
take a hand. And why did they threaten to strike?

04:47.306 --> 04:48.867
Because you were clamping down? Oh yes, because I 
didn't live up to my promise. I told them if they

04:56.540 --> 05:02.208
would give up the paddle I would enforce their 
rams.

05:04.671 --> 05:08.056
And then after a year I thought something over. I 
said now here's a ram that I'm making this poor damn

05:08.236 --> 05:13.403
freshman carry food. when he gets caught when he's 
not guilty at all. And I don't like to do that. And so

05:20.697 --> 05:27.327
I got out an order that I would not enforce their 
round for that one thing. Well they wouldn't take

05:28.308 --> 05:29.931
it that way. You just didn't say that. You said you 
would enforce our rounds if we'd give up the

05:31.854 --> 05:35.239
paddle.

05:38.813 --> 05:40.996
I was the only one that ever felt that way about it. 
As far as I know, the board of directors, the

05:41.016 --> 05:53.412
president, and everybody else just figured that I 
ought to, evidently ought to have done, ought to

05:41.016 --> 05:53.412
have enforced those ramps and said nothing about 
it. But I'm just not that way. How can anybody be

05:57.438 --> 05:59.000
that way? You gotta be reasonable. And so that was 
it.

06:09.458 --> 06:13.924
The board of directors came up here to make an 
investigation. They talked to every senior that

06:14.524 --> 06:17.388
wanted to talk to them. They never did ask to see me. 
I went down there and I said, you haven't asked to

06:20.392 --> 06:24.637
see me, but now I'm asking to see you.

06:28.682 --> 06:31.806
And I went over this stuff with them. And they still 
couldn't figure that I should have done it. I said,

06:35.811 --> 06:39.415
well, now listen, if you don't want my program, you 
don't want me. I'm resigning. They said, oh no. No,

06:44.899 --> 06:45.720
no, no. We're not going to let you resign. You'll 
save us $15,000 on broken furniture and stuff like

06:47.743 --> 06:52.088
that. You made them pay for it. But that's the only 
thing they complimented me for. They could

06:56.554 --> 07:04.223
understand those dollars and the fact that I made 
those boys quit doing that stuff and things like

06:56.554 --> 07:04.223
that. Well, one old boy at the school just kicked 
all the slaps out of the window, out of the door. His

07:10.985 --> 07:12.808
name was John Crow. No, it wasn't John, it was his 
younger brother. Well, I just told him, I said, now

07:18.177 --> 07:35.406
Dr. Walton, I'm not going to stand for that stuff, 
but will you promise me, Dr. Walton, that you will

07:18.177 --> 07:35.406
spend everything I sent, that I saved this school 
this year, this coming year, will you give them

07:18.177 --> 07:35.406
better furniture? He said, I sure will. Now that's 
the only thing that board of directors

07:36.986 --> 07:42.192
complimented me on was saving them that money. And 
so I just resigned. And as I said, they wouldn't

07:46.216 --> 07:49.839
take my resignation. He says, we're going to come 
up here and straighten things out. Well, that

07:54.965 --> 07:56.746
sounded all right to me. That's all I wanted them to 
do. But you know what those darn people did? No,

08:02.412 --> 08:02.873
what? They double crossed me. They 
double-crossed me. Dr. Walton called me in the

08:07.873 --> 08:16.724
middle of the summer, or it might have been late in 
August. It had been here, it's been three months

08:16.744 --> 08:22.190
now since all this confrontation took place. 
Everybody that knew anything about A&M, that they

08:24.393 --> 08:35.346
didn't like at least, after all these thousands of 
freshmen that had run off, I had letters and

08:24.393 --> 08:35.346
telegrams from people like that. backing me up. 
The law of the state backed me up.

08:44.586 --> 08:56.298
So, by golly, they couldn't take my resignation 
because they're backing up people that were doing

08:44.586 --> 08:56.298
all these things that are not even legal. And here 
I'm trying to straighten it out and they have taken

08:57.500 --> 09:01.364
the side of senior class. And so I just quit. Then 
they said, no, we're not going to let you quit.

09:07.235 --> 09:16.968
You've done too much good and decided that $15,000 
had saved

09:07.235 --> 09:16.968
them. They couldn't afford to do it because if they 
took the side of these other people, they'd be on

09:17.008 --> 09:31.388
the spot because they're defending stuff that the 
state of Texas didn't want them to defend. That

09:32.178 --> 09:41.071
senior class got together with me before they 
struck over at the old line and pleaded with me,

09:32.178 --> 09:41.071
please don't change our school. We'd rather have 
1,500 good eggs than 15,000 tea suppers. I said,

09:49.503 --> 09:51.746
don't change our school. Please don't change our 
school. I said, it's not your school. You've taken

09:57.314 --> 10:00.058
it over and you think that you've run it. you're 
only allowed to come here. This is not your school.

10:06.062 --> 10:14.634
This school belongs to the University of the State 
of Texas, the people of the State of Texas, and I'm

10:06.062 --> 10:14.634
not going to let you keep doing what you're doing." 
All right. Then's when this struck. That had been

10:18.940 --> 10:22.445
followed by the incident of the Beale over here, 
you see. They just got together to talk things over

10:22.986 --> 10:28.273
with me that I had made them a promise. I finally had 
to walk out on them. I said, there's no use in you

10:32.399 --> 10:37.366
talking to me anymore, cause you, we're just miles 
and miles apart. And I just walked out. Well then

10:39.149 --> 10:43.756
that's when they decided they couldn't take any 
more of me. And I had decided that they didn't, it

10:45.699 --> 10:50.906
was me or nothing. And I'd already told the board of 
directors that. But they weren't men enough to

10:52.689 --> 10:55.493
take my resignation. They couldn't stand against 
all this backing that I had all over the state. They

11:00.872 --> 11:02.874
just wanted to ease me out. And after about three 
months, Dr. Walton called me in and said, now,

11:03.374 --> 11:14.904
Colonel Frank, you've got a lot of friends around 
here. A lot of people respect you pretty heavily,

11:15.905 --> 11:18.587
pretty deeply.

11:22.571 --> 11:25.193
But the board of directors feels it would be better 
just would be better for you to go on back down to the

11:25.527 --> 11:29.331
athletic field."

11:35.738 --> 11:37.080
I said, alright. Alright, Dr. Walton.

11:44.788 --> 11:49.493
I just love you, Dr. Walton, and you're an awful 
good friend of mine, but you just, he was getting

11:50.232 --> 11:54.478
ready to go to Europe for some, you know, their own 
business. And I said, you just have a good time now

11:54.558 --> 11:57.302
over in Europe. So everything's gonna be all right 
over here. And I just, I just boiling inside. I went

12:02.990 --> 12:13.445
to Dean Bolton and I said, Dean Bolton,

12:02.990 --> 12:13.445
I'm not through fighting. I don't like to be 
treated like that. I'm going to Houston right now

12:16.523 --> 12:25.497
and I'm going to run the

12:16.523 --> 12:25.497
chairman of the board of directors of this state if 
I can." He said, oh, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Anderson,

12:27.320 --> 12:34.270
please don't do that. He said, you set this school 
back ten years. Oh, Lordy Dean Bolton, I don't want

12:39.378 --> 12:43.324
to do that. But I said, Dean Bolton, you've got more 
sense than I have. I'll do what you said. He said,

12:52.442 --> 13:05.655
well, Mr. Anderson, he said, I'm on your side a 
whole lot, Mr. Anderson, but I think that you'd be

12:52.442 --> 13:05.655
better to do what they said. He said, Mr. Anderson, 
you believe in revolution, not evolution. That's

13:14.607 --> 13:19.234
what that good old dean told me. I guess he's right. 
Oh, Lord have mercy. Well. So you resigned in 1937.

13:32.532 --> 13:34.996
I go back down to the athletic field. We win six out 
of the seven of the first, my next year's. And then

13:44.459 --> 13:57.957
the

13:44.459 --> 13:57.957
former students under Coach Bryant got us in 
trouble.

13:57.977 --> 14:11.395
And I told him, I said, now I'm going to resign, I 
mean retire in a couple of years, Coach.

14:11.695 --> 14:14.438
I can't take my team to the Texas relays. I can't 
take my team to the Drake or the Kansas relays. I

14:21.284 --> 14:25.648
can't take them to the NCAA meet because we're on 
probation. And they put track on probation along

14:26.369 --> 14:31.894
with football and everything else. They 
shouldn't have done it. They ought to just punish

14:32.815 --> 14:37.940
the people that did this thing and your former 
students did it. Why? Tell me about this. I said, I

14:40.450 --> 14:42.853
have nothing to work for, coach. I haven't had a 
place to take my teams to. Please get a youngster

14:49.461 --> 14:53.526
and let me work with him for the next two years. He 
wouldn't give a darn about track. He was kind to me.

14:59.353 --> 15:03.118
I'm an old boy that's getting ready to retire. And 
who's this now? Who's this now? I was getting ready

15:08.497 --> 15:10.320
to retire. No, I know, but who were you talking to? 
Brown. Oh, okay. Bear Bryant. Okay. He didn't care

15:17.973 --> 15:20.156
about track either. Oh, well he had no, he wanted to 
play football in the spring. He wanted to play

15:23.982 --> 15:25.725
football all year round. He didn't care about any 
other sport but track. But football. And so, and I

15:30.473 --> 15:33.458
said, Now you do that because if you don't track's 
going to suffer because I'm leaving here after two

15:35.142 --> 15:42.149
years. I cannot afford to leave now because of my 
teacher's retirement and social security. I've

15:46.914 --> 15:52.120
got to get those up and I won't be old enough to 
retire. But there's things are why there's

15:53.621 --> 15:59.007
nothing to work for much.

16:03.745 --> 16:06.668
So he said, oh, coach, you're just doing fine. He 
said, we don't need it. He said, we don't need

16:08.711 --> 16:13.777
anything any better. You're just doing real fine. 
And so I couldn't get him to get anybody at all.

16:19.443 --> 16:23.288
Well, two years came around, and now I'm quitting. 
And I went to him, and I said, now, coach, I'm going

16:24.389 --> 16:27.993
now. And you haven't got anybody. nearly July and 
all the people had been recruited for next year.

16:37.285 --> 16:42.232
Why

16:37.285 --> 16:42.232
don't you just get Putnam? Putnam was a professor 
who used to come down and help me with the distance

16:42.973 --> 16:47.800
man. He was an old mile champion. About an old, I saw 
him run Lincoln, Nebraska. Win the mile. And he was

16:58.758 --> 17:03.024
down here, and I knew him, and I got him to come out 
there and help me a little bit. And he helped

17:03.044 --> 17:11.557
O'Ryland and on up to Charlie Thomas for a few years 
before he stopped.

17:11.577 --> 17:19.748
Well, then he just volunteered this statement 
when he hadn't got anybody. He says, Coach, they

17:19.788 --> 17:22.813
ought not to be a track coach. He says, as far as I'm 
concerned, they ought not to be a baseball coach.

17:28.390 --> 17:33.096
Two professors ought to come down here and run 
those on a part-time basis. Now that's what Barry

17:33.977 --> 17:36.200
Brown told me. Wow. That's incredible, isn't it? 
Yeah.

17:43.029 --> 17:46.414
And that explained why he didn't get anybody for 
those two years. And of course, Charlie Thomas

17:47.715 --> 17:53.864
followed Putnam and Putnam, he just didn't have 
any time to coach the team. No. He is a full-time

17:54.665 --> 17:56.207
professor. Here I am You know, I was a coach that had 
all the waiter jobs. I said we didn't have any help

18:03.603 --> 18:07.849
from the former students. You said that the former 
students got you in trouble in the 1950s. Will you

18:14.598 --> 18:16.040
tell me about that? How'd they get you in trouble? 
How'd they get you on probation? By, by, well, all

18:19.745 --> 18:27.456
the coaches in the conference teamed up on Barbara 
Brown. he was winning. And I just felt he had just

18:31.308 --> 18:35.195
raised the ante, you see. Because they were doing 
things about getting people in. But he gets people

18:39.243 --> 18:43.230
in that they couldn't get in, you see. And he's 
beaten them. And they didn't like that.

18:51.213 --> 18:59.525
I think he must have just given somebody or got, I 
don't think he did it, but I think some former

18:51.213 --> 18:59.525
students that had some money did it. And they 
teamed up on him and they finally got him. He left.

19:06.535 --> 19:10.841
Yeah.

19:10.861 --> 19:12.924
But how did you get on probation? But he

19:12.964 --> 19:18.992
got Putnam and Putnam was no time at all. couldn't 
do anything with that track team. He had them one

19:22.845 --> 19:26.209
year, and then they got Charlie Thomas. And it took 
Charlie some while to build up the team. And I

19:33.176 --> 19:34.537
helped Charlie Thomas. I helped him. I worked with 
those people for four or five or six years, just

19:36.299 --> 19:40.983
like I was coaching. He and Ted Nelson were both 
runners.

19:47.490 --> 19:48.591
And my strong point was in the field. My jumpers and 
falters and weight men and my hurdlers were better

19:52.911 --> 19:57.698
than my runners. I don't care whether they were 
short or long runners. But we did have a mile relay

20:00.401 --> 20:06.370
team that wasn't defeated for four years. I want to 
show you their picture. But I was a field man

20:08.754 --> 20:12.178
mostly. And then the people who run the Olympic 
Games were kind enough to make me an Olympic coach,

20:19.908 --> 20:23.653
and give me field events to coach. And I had a chance 
to work with some boys. Al Orter stills were on the

20:28.279 --> 20:30.282
discus. He threw it for me the first time he was ever 
in the Olympics. And he used the swing that I had for

20:36.370 --> 20:39.915
him. Rayford Johnson was the Catholic man. He used 
the swing that I gave him. And he won the decathlon

20:49.895 --> 20:55.502
second that year and then the next four years he won 
the darn thing. I had boys to win first and second

20:57.464 --> 21:06.856
in three events and first in two of them. On that 
team it went to Australia.

21:13.704 --> 21:16.628
That was an honor to get up to be an Olympic coach. 
And we were the only coaches that's ever done any

21:16.962 --> 21:23.833
coaching because that happened to be in the 
southern hemisphere. We have Olympics up here in

21:24.494 --> 21:27.739
August, late August. And down there they have them 
in late November. So we got that team together in

21:36.272 --> 21:39.257
September and coached them. actually worked with 
them. I had a chance to change somebody's form and

21:41.610 --> 21:47.014
teach them a better way. They can't do that now when 
you're a coach and then you get on the boat. The day

21:53.700 --> 21:57.143
you qualify, you get on the boat and here you go. And 
all they can do, coaches, all they can do is try to

21:57.923 --> 22:02.267
keep the men from going to sleep. One poor guy let 
his sprinter sleep while they were out there

22:03.728 --> 22:09.413
running the race. I have a question about your 
attempts to control hazing. Tell me about the

22:18.565 --> 22:20.347
hazing problem.

22:25.934 --> 22:37.408
Well, they

22:25.934 --> 22:37.408
hazed in a number of ways.

22:37.912 --> 22:45.559
A freshman was more or less, that's a little female 
red bird. If the male comes out there and you see the

22:45.939 --> 22:52.685
red one, you call my attention to it and I'll go out 
and feed him. He won't fly off. If she's out there to

22:55.328 --> 22:57.089
hear me, I'd call him in. Cardinal, now that's his 
daughter.

23:03.815 --> 23:06.838
He was out there yesterday feeding her. He'd take 
up a grain, he'd run across and she'd open her mouth

23:07.207 --> 23:11.491
and he'd put it in her mouth. Now that's a young one, 
a young cardinal, female. Alright now, is this

23:22.521 --> 23:24.843
thing still working? Sure is. That's okay. Where 
am I? You're talking about the number of different

23:28.987 --> 23:33.611
ways in which the Corps hazed. Yeah.

23:40.973 --> 23:42.935
Well, I've told you about drilling them at 
midnight. Yeah. I would like to give...

23:45.517 --> 23:56.228
Now, I'm now back in athletics. A year or two later, 
I go down to Corpus. A year or two later than what? I

24:03.014 --> 24:05.356
go to Corpus with my track team. During the... What 
year? Easter...

24:10.758 --> 24:11.559
period off. Well, this would be 46, 47, 48, 58, 59, 
60, 61,

24:12.160 --> 24:27.839
62, 63,

24:12.160 --> 24:27.839
those years. Down there was my team. Gibb is up here 
now struggling in what I'm doing, what I did. He

24:35.869 --> 24:38.773
took up the torch that I passed to him He's a 
University of Texas graduate who is now president

24:39.682 --> 24:44.827
of A&M College. He's trying to carry out what I 
started. He's trying to break up this business of

24:50.533 --> 24:59.462
running everybody off from A&M and keeping them 
here and graduating them and getting more people

24:50.533 --> 24:59.462
to come that are afraid to come. And he was an 
important character. He was a fine man but he had He

25:08.420 --> 25:11.423
didn't know how to make a lot of friends. He didn't 
make a lot of friends at A&M College. But to me, he is

25:15.206 --> 25:21.092
the best man that ever put a foot on this campus. 
Because he put my baby over. The legislature

25:28.920 --> 25:31.062
backed him. But now, before it came down to a crisis 
and they had to back him. I was down at Corpus now

25:38.558 --> 25:42.423
with my track team. He was in bad with the school 
because he was trying to carry out the program that

25:42.443 --> 25:47.269
I had started.

25:50.593 --> 26:05.813
Seniors, all the seniors went to different places 
to make a speech during that time, Easter break in

25:50.593 --> 26:05.813
school, to get Jeb Gilchrist out. The senior from 
Corpus Christi the son of the mother of the A&M

26:08.579 --> 26:13.405
Mother of the Year, fine people. He got up there and 
he rang all those people at that A&M club meeting in

26:14.627 --> 26:20.193
Corpus.

26:23.377 --> 26:37.455
Old Colonel Bill Sterling, a fine old,

26:23.377 --> 26:37.455
he's general now, just a fine character. a 
well-known one, he was there, the chairman of that

26:38.245 --> 26:43.574
meeting. Well, that man talked. Well, I was 
sitting there with old Cleo Buck, who was the

26:45.817 --> 26:49.784
captain of my team in 28. This is now a long time 
later. But he is an alumnus that lives in Corpus.

26:58.137 --> 27:02.364
Bill sees me out back there and he says, Colonel 
Anderson's here. I want to come up here and say a

27:02.444 --> 27:04.067
word. come on up here, Frank, come on up here now, 
don't, don't, don't, back row, other way, come on.

27:12.007 --> 27:17.253
And he said, now, this, you tell us what, what you 
think about all this stuff that this man's talked

27:12.007 --> 27:17.253
about. Well, I said, Bill, I just, I just 100% 
disagree with you. I just back, give Gilchrist to

27:23.741 --> 27:26.143
the limit. He's doing and has done what I couldn't 
try, I tried very hard to do. And, uh, He said, well,

27:34.675 --> 27:38.680
he said, well, just sit down here. He said, 
freshman, I want to ask you some questions. What do

27:44.446 --> 27:46.248
you think of A&M? Oh, I think it's fine. I think it's 
fine. He said, school's nearly out now. He says, I

27:51.755 --> 27:53.937
paid the price. I'll get it even next year. You'll 
get it even next year? What you mean? Well, I can

27:59.984 --> 28:04.429
give them the same treatment they gave me. And, 
well, what do you do? Well, they're not as bad as the

28:09.681 --> 28:25.044
paddlers as they said they used to be, but I guess 
not the worst thing as far as I'm concerned is

28:09.681 --> 28:25.044
having to take a cold bath about three o'clock in 
the morning.

28:30.412 --> 28:30.973
He said, But he says, it's all right, it's fine, I'm 
forever a bit of it, because when you're

28:32.405 --> 28:40.977
understood anyhow. Then Bill said, well listen,

28:40.997 --> 28:50.610
if they get you up to do that at 3 o'clock in the 
morning, when in the world do you sleep? He said, I

28:50.630 --> 28:52.172
always sleep in class. He's just saying what he 
shouldn't have said, don't you think? But that, I

28:59.877 --> 29:04.542
thought I'd bust right open when he said that. And 
Bill said, oh, shucks. Meeting adjourned.

29:07.686 --> 29:10.109
Meeting adjourned. So that senior didn't get 
anywhere down there. He didn't seem to get

29:13.312 --> 29:25.026
anywhere, too many places, because the 
legislature came out with laws and give gilches

29:13.312 --> 29:25.026
intended to enforce them. And when the, The 
captains went over and tendered their

29:26.607 --> 29:29.812
resignations. He said, I hate to see you boys do 
this to yourself, but all right, I'll accept them.

29:35.380 --> 29:36.842
They didn't say you'd do that. This is 1947? Huh? 
This is 1947 and the revolt?

29:47.036 --> 29:47.357
Yes. That would have been in 47. It could have been 
in the spring of 48.

29:56.881 --> 29:57.722
Spring of 47. Well,

29:57.862 --> 30:03.290
I guess it could have been the spring of 47. But I'm 
down at Corpus now and I wasn't the track coach

30:03.911 --> 30:11.022
until 46 and we didn't go down until that year. It 
could have been, I think it must have been at least

30:11.983 --> 30:16.850
48. Okay, 48 then.

30:21.136 --> 30:23.760
And so the captains tendered their resignation. 
The captains tendered The Corps captains

30:26.058 --> 30:28.622
tendered their resignations. Yeah, all the 
captains, every single captain presented their

30:29.984 --> 30:39.078
resignations.

30:40.120 --> 30:45.889
He just kind of hate to have to do it, but you're no 
longer the captain. If you want to quit, I'll take

30:47.912 --> 30:50.316
your resignation. Because we don't want you with 
what you want.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.402
We won't take you for what you want. We're just 
going to have to do about some of these things." And

31:05.589 --> 31:07.851
the law was back on us. And it happened. A&M started 
just blooming.

31:20.824 --> 31:21.885
And I started waiting.

31:24.607 --> 31:25.208
I picked up Because more students were coming. And 
I learned my lesson about recruiting. The first

31:32.793 --> 31:38.378
one I got, couldn't make my team. The third year in 
school, he couldn't even make my team. And he was

31:41.561 --> 31:45.164
the high school champion quarter miler, but he 
couldn't make my team. Why not? Because they had

31:46.846 --> 31:53.912
boys better than he was that didn't go to the state 
meet and win the darn thing. But they worked here

31:54.179 --> 31:56.582
hard enough to where they could. Let me show you 
that relay team. I can show you. You want to turn

32:01.267 --> 32:03.029
that off now, sir, while? Sure.

32:06.373 --> 32:14.543
Yeah, I'd like to ask you

32:06.373 --> 32:14.543
a couple more questions. Why were you appointed 
the first dean of men?

32:21.511 --> 32:24.034
That is a combination job. The commandant before 
my time was not the dean of men. I was the first dean

32:30.819 --> 32:35.566
of men, but I was still the commandant. Why did they 
decide to have a position of dean of men? All the big

32:40.934 --> 32:42.697
schools had them. They thought they might as well 
join. I used to go to the dean of men's meeting. Of

32:48.907 --> 32:54.375
course, I wasn't in the job very long, but one year 
it was in Austin, and I attended the dean of men's

32:48.907 --> 32:54.375
meeting.

32:58.304 --> 33:04.712
So I did the work of discipline plus the job of dean 
of men. It was just a kind of a job. And then I had a

33:09.558 --> 33:20.791
stenographer, a lady, and then two helpers.

33:23.895 --> 33:26.438
And now they have spread out all over. Between the 
DNM and the ComNet together, I mean, to have quite a

33:27.970 --> 33:34.316
spread of helpers. Do you remember when Franklin 
Roosevelt came to Texas A&M in 1937? I was in charge

33:41.723 --> 33:43.425
of that day. Could you tell me about it? Well, he 
came here on his special train. He got off. I had to

33:54.785 --> 33:59.151
take the responsibility of guarding that man.

34:02.094 --> 34:10.706
We had to submit a route that he would take a parade, 
and I had to see to it that not another car was parked

34:02.094 --> 34:10.706
on that thing. And

34:12.728 --> 34:23.442
then just generally

34:12.728 --> 34:23.442
see him in and out. of the talk he made. Of course he 
had to have a little platform to hold up on. My

34:30.093 --> 34:40.688
wife and my two young boys were there. I think 
Wally, the younger one, was about five, something

34:40.808 --> 34:47.337
like that probably. The other one was two years 
older. Did you get to talk to President Roosevelt?

34:56.049 --> 34:58.491
Did you get to talk with President Roosevelt? 
Nothing, just to say hello.

35:04.957 --> 35:11.002
I was not, I just, when I finally came in I just sat 
down with my wife and two boys. He stayed there, he

35:12.203 --> 35:23.213
had his own guards, but I was in charge and I had to 
keep, had to keep people off of that route. So I had

35:25.716 --> 35:39.395
some, I'd call them gray sergeants that worked

35:25.716 --> 35:39.395
for me full time, people. Now they were the people 
that when these people came back from Fort Worth

35:40.516 --> 35:52.052
and had plundered the Texas Hotel, I told you about 
that, I got those gray sergeants while these

35:52.488 --> 36:02.878
people were drilling on Thursday afternoon and I 
had written the hotel to the police. They told me

36:03.018 --> 36:18.293
they didn't want us to come there anymore and I 
wrote them back, just please tell me the names of

36:03.018 --> 36:18.293
the people who were in that room where the stuff was 
gone and we'll do what we can about it.

36:23.521 --> 36:35.080
So while they were drilling on Thursday 
afternoon, I got my gray sergeants together, and

36:23.521 --> 36:35.080
there were four regular army officers that worked 
for the commandant, not the PMS&T, but the

36:23.521 --> 36:35.080
commandant. That's me. And we had pass keys to all 
the rooms, and so we divided up by force, and we gave

36:36.442 --> 36:49.663
this man a list of stuff that's in this dormitory 
and this and this and this, And while they were

36:50.167 --> 36:53.251
drilling, we went there and we got all that stuff. 
Didn't I tell you that story? No. Well, I don't know

36:55.013 --> 36:59.279
if we overlooked that one. So while they were 
drilling, we went there, we unlocked their lock,

37:01.962 --> 37:08.471
we went in there and we found every bit of that 
stuff. One man had run off with a floor lamp. He was

37:12.956 --> 37:16.461
the senior and the...

37:17.740 --> 37:19.001
social secretary. He had run over the floor lamp. 
The balance of them had been satisfied with towels

37:20.984 --> 37:29.553
and blotters and a picture of something. But, oh 
golly, we got it all. And so I just sent for those

37:34.018 --> 37:36.560
boys one at a time. And I said, now, they have 
written to us that they don't want us to come up

37:37.621 --> 37:43.408
there anymore. We can't live with that. And I don't 
want to do anything to you that will hurt you

37:47.997 --> 37:53.244
deeply. You think you should have done that, I 
guess. It's all right with you to do those things.

37:59.593 --> 38:02.637
And a lot of people do and think nothing about it. 
But this hotel writes us that they don't want us

38:03.518 --> 38:07.022
anymore. So I've got to do something to you. You sit 
down here, I've got the wrapping paper, and you

38:13.748 --> 38:27.383
wrap this thing up, address it back to that hotel, 
sign this letter that you apologize and promise

38:13.748 --> 38:27.383
never to do such a thing like that again anywhere. 
We'll go over here and you'll buy the stamps and

38:28.945 --> 38:33.149
we'll mail you a package and stamp your letter.

38:36.633 --> 38:37.714
And then, boy, you're not going to go to any other 
football games away from home this year. And they

38:44.841 --> 38:46.724
always had court trips in those days. And that was 
the first one. And that's what did it at that hotel.

38:52.753 --> 38:57.620
Next couple of weeks, we went to Houston. And I 
wrote to Rice Hotel. I said, now, I'm working on

38:59.623 --> 39:04.630
something up here, and I want your help. They 
raided the Texas Hotel in Fort Worth pretty badly

39:06.854 --> 39:13.100
two weeks ago, and I popped it to them. I want you to 
be sure to get a record of everything that's gone

39:14.441 --> 39:20.447
from your hotel.

39:24.631 --> 39:25.292
And let me know. I got a letter from them a couple of 
days after the game was over, and they said, oh,

39:26.713 --> 39:32.659
don't bother about it. Don't bother. One fella 
took a towel, but please just forget it. I

39:37.813 --> 39:45.103
didn't tell you that story? That's what I did. 
Those things happened. Now,

39:48.147 --> 40:01.324
I talked against the toilet paper incident. I 
talked against

40:03.250 --> 40:13.124
the Yale leaders who would exhort these kids, you 
be there. If you can't do anything else but catch a

40:13.885 --> 40:18.010
freight train, you be there. If you can't get in a 
ticket, climb a fence. You be there. You've got to

40:21.956 --> 40:23.598
support this team. This

40:23.638 --> 40:30.928
school was nuts.

40:34.317 --> 40:36.419
Are you a Texan? No, I'm from Minnesota. Huh? 
Minnesota, remember I told you I was from

40:38.381 --> 40:41.665
Minnesota. Don't ever ask a man is he from Texas. 
I'm a Tennessean, but I've been living out here so

40:46.149 --> 40:50.894
darn long and I love it. I'm a Tennessean and we like 
Tennessee a lot. We popularize the north half of

40:55.939 --> 40:58.502
Texas. And a lot of my uncles, I remember an uncle of 
mine putting his wife and kids into a covering

40:59.056 --> 41:07.644
wagon on the head for Texas. And they're living up 
here at Wolf City now. And some of them went

41:11.989 --> 41:16.153
further, up to Chillicothe and on out to Quanah. 
But up that lane, they're Tennessee people. Just

41:20.357 --> 41:27.544
like my pioneer folks that came across the 
Alleghenies when nobody owned the land but the

41:20.357 --> 41:27.544
Indians. They did it coming on out here. Oh, I lose 
the train of thought. I get off on so many things. I

41:37.537 --> 41:41.745
was wondering about the relationship. You were in 
the physical education department for a while.

41:47.268 --> 41:54.698
And I was wondering about the relationship 
between physical education department and the

41:47.268 --> 41:54.698
athletic department. I had my privilege of doing 
what I wanted to do when I went down there. Coach

42:02.568 --> 42:04.670
Norton, I never did like him. I liked him all right. 
He was all right, but he fired all my friends. And I

42:12.020 --> 42:13.782
was coaching under him. And I wasn't enjoying it. 
And when Dr. Walton offered me that job, I took it

42:18.994 --> 42:22.721
for two reasons. I wanted to get away from there and 
I wanted to crack at this. Well, I don't know that I

42:28.292 --> 42:37.069
had my mind made up about wanting to crack at this, 
but I must have because I wasn't doing too well in

42:28.292 --> 42:37.069
track on account of what was happening up here. And 
I felt like maybe I could make a contribution to

42:38.433 --> 42:45.663
future track teams, future basketball and 
baseball teams. As I said before, they had a hard

42:46.364 --> 43:02.127
time maybe getting football players because boys 
like, as I've told you before now, people are on

42:46.364 --> 43:02.127
this, these football players go back and talk 
about all the way things happened down here. He

43:02.167 --> 43:05.312
kind of stared their nose off and they'd go 
somewhere else. Yeah. I just thought maybe I could

43:06.884 --> 43:11.291
help athletics by being the commandant of one. And 
I thought I'd give it a quarrel, kind of a challenge

43:13.554 --> 43:18.482
to me.

43:23.350 --> 43:24.431
But they didn't want me. The faculty wanted me.

43:31.083 --> 43:33.226
But the board of directors were all in them. I only 
had one man on the board of directors. He was from

43:35.569 --> 43:36.730
San Antonio. He was on my side.

43:42.497 --> 43:46.242
But they wouldn't let me quit until four months. 
And the furor order all passed over. And now here's

43:49.947 --> 43:52.370
another man. There was an explanation one way or 
another. They just had a new man. A man that I liked.

43:59.956 --> 44:04.943
Colonel Moore was a fine friend of mine, and he 
picked a commandant that I recommended too. He

44:05.984 --> 44:09.649
picked a commandant, I mean a cadet colonel.

44:13.334 --> 44:17.340
How did you get along with the former students? 
Tell me about your relationship with the former

44:17.360 --> 44:23.148
students, former student association.
