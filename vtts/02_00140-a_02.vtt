WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:04.758
Is that a grade point man?

00:04.778 --> 00:06.500
Probably, yeah.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.722
That's what it was later.

00:07.742 --> 00:09.424
That's probably what it was, yeah.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.326
He gives high grades like nobody can.

00:11.366 --> 00:11.466
Yeah.

00:11.486 --> 00:16.893
Alright, if you needed advice, counsel, who did you go to talk to?

00:21.558 --> 00:22.820
I talked to another fish.

00:26.244 --> 00:26.484
Really?

00:26.545 --> 00:26.825
Who?

00:26.845 --> 00:27.926
Just anybody.

00:28.046 --> 00:31.050
But did you have some special friends that

00:31.216 --> 00:38.847
Now you look back and realize... No, my special friends at Lamar were not my special friends my freshman year.

00:39.548 --> 00:41.912
Oh, no, wait, I'm talking about now all four years.

00:42.472 --> 00:43.574
Oh, all four years?

00:43.614 --> 00:44.876
Yes, yes.

00:44.896 --> 00:51.145
Yes, tell faculty, advisors, counselors.

00:51.305 --> 00:52.888
No, no.

00:52.908 --> 00:54.189
If we had that, I don't know.

00:54.630 --> 00:55.692
I didn't know about it, no.

00:55.792 --> 00:59.417
I never did go to any faculty member.

00:59.836 --> 01:19.964
Were there some upperclassmen that you now realize had an impact on your academic... Well, of course, you know, you can remember upperclassmen that probably didn't know.

01:23.449 --> 01:29.337
No, I didn't talk to them, but I mean, there are people that I remember seeing as freshmen.

01:29.789 --> 01:35.677
and sophomore when they come out with their boots on and you know, they look like gods.

01:37.299 --> 01:44.528
Who were, when you were an underclassman, who were the campus prominent personalities?

01:45.970 --> 01:53.240
Preston Bolton was, Preston Bolton was our battalion commander in my official year in 1941.

01:53.260 --> 01:54.481
Describe you.

01:54.501 --> 01:58.767
Well, Preston, he

01:59.590 --> 02:02.234
He was Dean Bolton's son, you know.

02:02.274 --> 02:05.218
You know Preston, don't you?

02:06.881 --> 02:09.485
Well, of course, I didn't know him then.

02:10.286 --> 02:13.691
I didn't know him until long after I'd gotten out of A&M.

02:13.851 --> 02:18.578
He didn't have anything to do with us, but his fish, our sophomores.

02:18.963 --> 02:26.250
You know, the class distinction between a junior and a senior and a sophomore and a fish were, you know, just, I mean, it was night and day.

02:26.270 --> 02:31.015
You didn't have any friends that were sophomores or juniors or seniors.

02:31.035 --> 02:32.857
There weren't any friends.

02:32.877 --> 02:41.025
And as a sophomore, you were just merely tolerated by the juniors and seniors.

02:41.045 --> 02:48.632
I mean, they wore the different uniforms, the beautiful, you know, and juniors had their own class distinction.

02:50.097 --> 02:53.460
You talk about discrimination, boy.

02:53.480 --> 02:56.323
People don't know what discrimination is until it's heard.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.087
Went through all that stuff.

03:00.107 --> 03:02.449
Did you ever think about leaving school, leaving any?

03:02.469 --> 03:03.050
Oh, God, yes.

03:03.470 --> 03:04.071
Many times.

03:06.814 --> 03:08.035
I've thought about it many times.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.296
We'd have these air outs.

03:10.778 --> 03:12.279
Tell me about an air out.

03:12.299 --> 03:20.087
An air out is, I don't know who decided when there would be one, but they could come at any time of the night.

03:20.810 --> 03:25.556
and they would just get the freshman and get them out.

03:25.756 --> 03:26.577
Was there a signal?

03:27.538 --> 03:28.739
Just air out.

03:28.779 --> 03:35.087
When you heard that sound, boy air out fish, and that freshman got the hell out of there.

03:35.107 --> 03:38.971
And then you better not be caught by anybody.

03:38.991 --> 03:43.597
And we found a house that was near Dormford.

03:43.617 --> 03:46.980
They had a lot of houses on the campus, professors' houses.

03:47.001 --> 03:49.163
And there was one that was...

03:50.290 --> 03:51.973
Bacon.

03:53.756 --> 04:06.578
And we, a couple of guys and myself, found a loose board where we could get under the house and then pull it back under there.

04:06.758 --> 04:07.920
And we got under the house.

04:08.642 --> 04:11.727
Codwebs, oh my god, it was just horrible.

04:11.747 --> 04:13.530
It smelled bad under there and everything.

04:14.101 --> 04:15.843
And now we'd be laying there.

04:16.024 --> 04:18.166
You know, what are we doing here?

04:18.347 --> 04:19.648
Why are we doing this?

04:20.750 --> 04:22.011
Are we having fun yet?

04:22.092 --> 04:24.294
Or, you know, when does this end?

04:25.416 --> 04:28.640
What was the signal that an air out was over that you could go back?

04:29.521 --> 04:30.543
Well, I don't remember.

04:31.444 --> 04:32.145
I don't remember.

04:32.846 --> 04:37.051
I think somebody yelled around, get back to the dorm, fish, or something like that.

04:37.111 --> 04:41.978
They'd go in yelling, get back to the dorm, air out's over, or something like that.

04:41.998 --> 04:43.720
When you, during the day...

04:44.189 --> 04:49.097
When you weren't in class during the day, where did you go?

04:49.137 --> 04:52.142
Where did I go?

04:54.806 --> 05:11.192
There were times, with 18 hours you had mostly in class, but I played tennis with a guy from Fort Worth.

05:12.083 --> 05:17.169
We would put on our shorts, and that was the only time we wore in uniform.

05:17.189 --> 05:19.913
You know, we'd wear shorts and a t-shirt.

05:19.933 --> 05:22.436
And later I learned to play handball at A&M.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.400
I'd never played handball before, but I learned how to play at A&M.

05:25.420 --> 05:28.303
I hadn't played tennis before.

05:28.323 --> 05:37.115
But I played a lot of handball down at, next to P.L.

05:37.135 --> 05:39.918
Downs in the auditorium, Charlie DeWare Fieldhouse.

05:39.938 --> 05:41.500
Yeah, describe DeWare Fieldhouse.

05:42.037 --> 05:45.661
Well, the Warefield House was one of the largest buildings on campus.

05:45.862 --> 05:46.823
It was huge.

05:46.943 --> 05:50.727
Well, it seated 2,000 people in there.

05:50.747 --> 05:51.989
You know, it was big.

05:52.009 --> 05:55.513
And I don't know how many handball courts they had.

05:55.553 --> 05:59.257
They must have had five or six hotels at the time.

05:59.838 --> 06:01.460
But not many people played handball.

06:02.281 --> 06:07.387
And I never seemed to have had much trouble getting the court.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.672
Now, did you students go to basketball games?

06:12.513 --> 06:14.835
Yeah, we went to everything.

06:14.855 --> 06:17.618
I mean, whatever A&M played, we were at everything.

06:18.159 --> 06:20.041
I went to every game that was played.

06:20.061 --> 06:21.102
Did y'all make any noise?

06:21.562 --> 06:22.443
Oh, God, yeah.

06:22.563 --> 06:23.484
We screamed all night.

06:23.945 --> 06:25.086
Couldn't talk the next day.

06:25.406 --> 06:33.555
If you could talk, they would really have some serious reservations about whether you supported the team or not the night before.

06:33.575 --> 06:39.261
All right, now your first fall, the football team had a fairly good year, I know.

06:39.561 --> 06:41.423
Yeah, they had a real good year.

06:41.757 --> 06:43.039
Describe that.

06:43.961 --> 06:45.483
Well, it was really fun.

06:45.523 --> 07:01.389
We had these, I don't know, the stationary that would come out with the team we were getting ready to play, but UCLA would be on it in color, and A&M would be, you know, beat the hell out of it and all.

07:01.409 --> 07:08.541
So I would write all my Sarah and a few other girlfriends that did that out.

07:09.601 --> 07:12.845
And you went to those games?

07:12.865 --> 07:14.547
Oh yeah, I went to every game.

07:14.567 --> 07:15.529
I went to every game.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.810
Did you go to some road games?

07:17.431 --> 07:18.713
I went to some road games.

07:19.073 --> 07:19.894
How did you get there?

07:20.375 --> 07:26.663
Hitchhiked to the Baylor and Fort Worth and Dallas and all.

07:26.683 --> 07:29.947
Stayed with other Aggies.

07:29.967 --> 07:31.349
They didn't have a lot of money.

07:31.630 --> 07:36.236
Describe the routine of a court trip during that era, during your four years.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.899
Well, a court trip was just a

07:39.166 --> 07:45.295
big mass exodus and it was a lot of fun.

07:45.475 --> 07:48.821
Everybody was there and we stayed together all the time.

07:48.841 --> 07:52.746
We would again stay with the people.

07:52.766 --> 08:03.022
When the Corps trip was in Houston, I'd have 12 Aggies maybe spending the night at my house with sleeping bags on the floor downstairs and I think my mother would feed them.

08:04.264 --> 08:07.148
And then you all would come downtown and the Corps

08:07.921 --> 08:12.767
The march would be on what street about what time?

08:12.988 --> 08:18.415
Bain Street, usually around then I think.

08:18.435 --> 08:19.556
March from the Rice Hotel.

08:20.617 --> 08:21.398
About how far?

08:24.923 --> 08:26.545
Six or eight blocks, look anyway.

08:27.566 --> 08:28.808
And then go to the game.

08:29.108 --> 08:30.210
And go to the game.

08:30.651 --> 08:37.219
Normally when the game was over, did you spend the Saturday night in that town on a court trip?

08:37.756 --> 08:52.836
Yes, if you had any money you could stay in a hotel room and a lot of times you'd go together and get two of them would sign up for the room, but quite a few more would be enough there.

08:53.597 --> 08:59.145
There was never anybody in a room by himself or a room for two or anything like that.

08:59.385 --> 09:03.370
I slept in bad tubs, I slept all over them.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.333
Court trips were held to what cities?

09:06.258 --> 09:12.487
In Fort Worth, Dallas, Waco, Austin, Arkansas, Houston.

09:12.507 --> 09:13.268
Arkansas?

09:13.288 --> 09:13.949
Yeah.

09:13.969 --> 09:17.895
But we never had a court trip to Arkansas, but of course that's where we played.

09:17.995 --> 09:18.696
No, we never had.

09:19.317 --> 09:26.447
No, they had, the court trips were Dallas and Fort Worth every other year.

09:26.487 --> 09:35.640
It was Dallas one year, Fort Worth one year, and Houston every other year, and then Austin every other year.

09:36.397 --> 09:44.649
If a student literally wasn't able to go on the court trip, was that bad or negative for that student?

09:45.270 --> 09:48.554
No, it wasn't.

09:50.377 --> 09:54.142
There were some that didn't, mostly because of money.

09:54.443 --> 09:58.989
In your four years, how many court trips do you think you missed?

09:59.009 --> 10:00.531
I know I missed one.

10:00.551 --> 10:01.673
You missed one in four years?

10:01.693 --> 10:03.876
I know I missed one.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.138
I missed one to Fort Worth.

10:06.991 --> 10:13.139
And I think that's the only one I missed.

10:13.159 --> 10:18.846
Alright, do you remember any particular incidents on court trips that are tellable?

10:25.374 --> 10:29.239
Gosh, they were all just mad houses.

10:29.259 --> 10:35.327
I mean, we used to think we owned the town when we would come to play football there.

10:36.202 --> 10:39.126
We'd be at the major hotel in all of them.

10:39.146 --> 10:40.888
In Houston, it was a rice hotel.

10:41.108 --> 10:44.612
We would have to yell to practice out there at midnight.

10:44.632 --> 10:46.214
And we didn't want anybody else around.

10:46.535 --> 10:49.739
You know, all the Houstonians would stay away.

10:49.759 --> 10:53.283
We didn't try to throw anybody out or anything, but we were making so much noise.

10:53.303 --> 10:56.507
Which hotel in Dallas do you remember?

10:56.527 --> 10:58.469
Yeah, it was the Adolphus.

10:58.490 --> 10:58.830
Adolphus.

10:59.511 --> 11:01.333
Austin?

11:01.353 --> 11:01.854
In Driscoll.

11:01.874 --> 11:02.294
Driscoll?

11:02.635 --> 11:02.895
Yeah.

11:02.915 --> 11:03.376
Fort Worth?

11:03.456 --> 11:05.398
Fort Worth, it was the- Blackstone?

11:06.779 --> 11:09.784
Texan?

11:09.804 --> 11:10.144
Rockstone.

11:10.164 --> 11:11.907
Texan, what else?

11:12.127 --> 11:13.990
You just ran out of my knowledge.

11:15.232 --> 11:15.653
Rockstone.

11:15.733 --> 11:20.280
All right, then on Saturday nights then, on court trips, what was the normal routine?

11:21.923 --> 11:28.974
Well, as I say, nobody had very much money, so you really didn't, we didn't do that.

11:28.994 --> 11:31.538
There wasn't one event for... No.

11:31.788 --> 11:37.295
If you brought some... Well, later on, when I became a sophomore, I was a freshman.

11:37.315 --> 11:38.416
We didn't do anything.

11:38.556 --> 11:39.598
No, but those other three years.

11:39.618 --> 11:40.459
Later on, we got dates.

11:40.779 --> 11:41.060
Okay.

11:41.120 --> 11:47.988
Yeah, we'd get dates and go out to... How did, let's say in Dallas or Fort Worth, how did you get a date?

11:48.008 --> 11:51.012
Well, I knew girls at Hockaday and at SMU.

11:51.052 --> 11:54.697
They were from Houston and gone up there to school.

11:54.717 --> 11:56.379
I knew them everywhere.

11:56.559 --> 11:59.683
Were you, as a good Aggie, supposed to get some dates?

11:59.703 --> 12:00.664
I never had a blind date.

12:01.336 --> 12:01.817
Oh, you didn't?

12:01.977 --> 12:02.137
No.

12:02.397 --> 12:05.862
Were you supposed to get dates for your buddies on a court trip to Houston?

12:06.322 --> 12:06.703
I did.

12:06.763 --> 12:06.883
I did.

12:06.903 --> 12:08.264
I got a lot of dates for them.

12:08.284 --> 12:16.254
I got some dates for some of my buddies that lived in smaller towns out that didn't know girls at Hockaday.

12:16.715 --> 12:18.617
I knew a lot of girls at Hockaday.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.499
Now, were you dating Sarah during those years?

12:20.680 --> 12:21.060
Yeah.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.241
She was away in school, though.

12:22.442 --> 12:22.962
Where?

12:23.143 --> 12:28.870
She was at Chatham Hall in Virginia and also Pine Manor in Boston.

12:28.890 --> 12:30.111
So she was always away.

12:30.327 --> 12:31.689
So you're writing to her.

12:32.751 --> 12:32.851
Yeah.

12:32.871 --> 12:35.895
But meanwhile, you might have had some dates also here.

12:36.056 --> 12:36.697
Might have had.

12:36.917 --> 12:37.618
Might have.

12:37.638 --> 12:41.123
I can't remember exactly, but might have.

12:41.504 --> 12:45.009
Alright, let's go back now to social life at A&M.

12:46.591 --> 12:54.102
Where did you and your friends go off campus for a good time in Brazos County?

12:54.122 --> 12:54.363
Ed's.

12:55.084 --> 12:55.344
What?

12:55.364 --> 12:56.847
Tell me about Ed's.

12:56.867 --> 12:59.170
Ed's was out there on Weldon Road.

12:59.555 --> 13:04.301
down the street you could walk to it.

13:04.321 --> 13:07.145
It wasn't a short distance, but we'd go to baseball games.

13:07.465 --> 13:18.140
That was, I guess, as much fun as I had as an upper class when I was going to baseball games and then walking down to Ed's after the game.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.022
What did Ed's serve?

13:20.042 --> 13:20.302
Beer.

13:22.605 --> 13:26.230
What was the favorite variety of beer for students then?

13:26.370 --> 13:27.292
Do you remember?

13:27.372 --> 13:28.313
Grand Prize.

13:29.018 --> 13:30.240
bottle then?

13:30.260 --> 13:32.062
Green Prize, as we later called it.

13:32.162 --> 13:34.205
Green Prize, huh?

13:34.225 --> 13:35.226
Now, was beer legal?

13:35.667 --> 13:36.067
Yeah.

13:36.087 --> 13:37.229
Okay, that wasn't good.

13:37.249 --> 13:37.509
No.

13:37.689 --> 13:43.297
As far as I know, did you have to be 21?

13:43.797 --> 13:44.678
They sold it to us.

13:45.359 --> 13:46.381
I don't think it did.

13:46.401 --> 13:47.542
I don't think you had to be 21.

13:47.642 --> 13:51.788
If somebody wanted some... Later it did.

13:52.008 --> 13:58.116
If somebody wanted a stronger liquor, whiskey or something, where did... Well, you had to go across the river.

13:58.136 --> 13:58.857
Well, that's...

13:59.174 --> 14:00.336
Way to have it gone.

14:00.356 --> 14:01.678
And what did y'all call it?

14:01.698 --> 14:02.119
Boston Highway.

14:02.239 --> 14:05.444
Did y'all have a name for that place?

14:05.524 --> 14:05.625
Yeah.

14:05.765 --> 14:07.047
Was it called Whiskey Bridge then?

14:07.488 --> 14:07.688
Yeah.

14:08.329 --> 14:08.950
Yeah.

14:08.970 --> 14:16.943
And was there... But we didn't know anybody had a car, so we didn't go as sophomores or freshmen or sophomores.

14:16.963 --> 14:25.958
We'd get to know later, especially if we had a girl that would come over from someplace that had a car to bring, and then we could go and get something to drink.

14:26.377 --> 14:29.542
But I didn't really know any, I didn't have a friend that had a car.

14:30.083 --> 14:33.969
All right, if there were any beverages like that, where did you drink them?

14:34.711 --> 14:37.335
In your... Just out of a bottle.

14:37.355 --> 14:40.119
No, no, but in the car or in the room or where?

14:40.760 --> 14:41.982
Never in the room, no.

14:42.002 --> 14:45.007
We never brought a girl shower.

14:45.728 --> 14:46.750
That was a no-no.

14:46.770 --> 14:49.034
Did you ever have... I don't know.

14:49.274 --> 14:51.558
There were times where people did that.

14:51.979 --> 14:52.840
You heard about it.

14:53.275 --> 14:59.404
But I didn't ever know anyone personally that ever brought a girl to their own.

14:59.424 --> 15:05.873
Did anybody ever keep any beer or other alcohol in the room?

15:05.893 --> 15:08.336
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:08.356 --> 15:20.413
Alright, were there some places in Bryan or College Station that were supposedly offering other services that... No, no, but there were other places.

15:20.917 --> 15:24.882
that my friend Prowl was going to.

15:24.902 --> 15:25.583
I don't know where.

15:26.985 --> 15:30.129
So there was no well-known house of ill repute?

15:30.149 --> 15:41.222
Well, there was in, well, no, it was close to the Chicken Ranch.

15:41.242 --> 15:41.343
Okay.

15:41.363 --> 15:42.404
That was going.

15:42.624 --> 15:43.986
Across the, oh, oh, yeah.

15:44.006 --> 15:47.470
We've heard of that at the Chicken Ranch, the one that- Down in the Grange.

15:47.550 --> 15:48.932
The Grange, yeah.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.343
That was heavily used by Austin people.

15:52.363 --> 15:55.707
Were there any rumors about Aggies going down there during your era?

15:55.727 --> 15:56.748
Yeah.

15:56.768 --> 16:02.774
I didn't go, but there were a lot of people that bragged about going.

16:02.794 --> 16:04.876
I think I drove by once.

16:05.076 --> 16:08.920
Do you think that their stories about their experiences there were accurate?

16:09.021 --> 16:11.763
Did they ever enlarge on the truth?

16:11.783 --> 16:15.207
I'm sure they were exaggerated.

16:15.811 --> 16:19.959
To a large degree, I'm sure it was expensive.

16:19.999 --> 16:21.061
We didn't have any money.

16:21.262 --> 16:25.309
I didn't have any money at all spent on anything.

16:26.111 --> 16:32.022
Do you have any recollection of the cost of the year in those days?

16:32.042 --> 16:32.123
No.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.427
How much spending money did you have?

16:35.740 --> 16:37.222
That, I don't remember that either.

16:37.242 --> 16:38.844
Did you get a kind of an allowance?

16:38.924 --> 16:40.105
I had an allowance, yeah.

16:40.445 --> 16:48.595
And it was enough to, you know, I could get a Coke and stuff like that on the side, but I couldn't really go and have a date.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.937
Did you have a job at A&M?

16:51.037 --> 16:52.860
No, no, I never did have to work.

16:52.880 --> 16:57.445
About what percentage of your classmates you think were, did have a program?

16:57.465 --> 16:59.828
Very few of my friends have jobs.

16:59.848 --> 17:01.009
But what about in general?

17:01.029 --> 17:04.633
But now, my friends today, a lot of them,

17:05.390 --> 17:10.836
But the ones I knew when I was there, none of them worked.

17:10.856 --> 17:12.779
I don't know where they are.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.983
But now I hear a lot of, of course I get to a lot of classes.

17:18.105 --> 17:28.938
My class, I really didn't know, have anybody as a friend that I saw on a regular basis that worked.

17:29.478 --> 17:32.522
But that, you know, I don't know how the world did it.

17:32.542 --> 17:35.025
Over the project houses, were they there then?

17:35.984 --> 17:38.447
Yeah, there were some day dodgers over there.

17:38.668 --> 17:39.048
Okay.

17:39.769 --> 17:42.653
Frogs and day dodgers, they were great.

17:42.673 --> 17:45.998
And about what percentage of the student body you think were day dodgers?

17:46.999 --> 17:47.520
Very small.

17:48.401 --> 17:48.501
Okay.

17:48.521 --> 17:50.243
Very small.

17:50.263 --> 17:51.145
I didn't know many.

17:51.165 --> 17:51.926
Okay.

17:52.126 --> 17:54.970
You had to be in the Corps the first two years.

17:56.192 --> 17:56.312
Right.

17:56.332 --> 17:58.495
But then you could be a civilian.

17:59.656 --> 17:59.897
No.

18:00.417 --> 18:03.261
In my time, the whole time, everybody was in the Corps.

18:03.421 --> 18:03.882
All four years?

18:04.165 --> 18:09.111
Yeah, and while I was only there for three, you know, we went the year-round.

18:11.633 --> 18:12.494
When did that start?

18:15.257 --> 18:19.302
Well, of course, on December the 7th of 1940.

18:19.542 --> 18:20.884
We'll get to that in a minute.

18:20.984 --> 18:21.544
Okay.

18:21.625 --> 18:23.126
That three semesters a year.

18:23.547 --> 18:30.615
Well, I'm just trying to get together on December 7th first, but that's when it started after that.

18:32.257 --> 18:33.598
I might have...

18:34.270 --> 18:42.479
That first year, my freshman year, yeah, I had a summer off.

18:43.860 --> 18:44.481
One summer off.

18:44.881 --> 18:45.863
Did you go to summer camp?

18:46.443 --> 18:47.965
No, I didn't do anything.

18:48.045 --> 18:52.470
I just had a summer free.

18:53.170 --> 19:00.318
I went and made up a couple of those engineering classes that I had failed.

19:00.518 --> 19:03.822
I went to the University of Houston and took two courses.

19:04.561 --> 19:08.145
that first summer, but that was the only summer from then on.

19:08.165 --> 19:12.769
42, 43 we went the year round.

19:13.049 --> 19:19.396
Now you're a freshman in September of 19...what?

19:19.416 --> 19:24.101
Your freshman year was September of 1940.

19:24.721 --> 19:34.551
Okay, then the years you're at A&M, what are the national or international events that you remember vividly

19:35.088 --> 19:37.551
when you heard those news reports?

19:39.553 --> 19:44.818
Well, the first one, of course, was the Pearl Harbor.

19:44.878 --> 19:46.820
How did you hear the news and where were you?

19:46.920 --> 19:48.362
I was at a movie at Guy and Hall.

19:49.483 --> 19:51.705
Guy and Hall is no longer there.

19:51.725 --> 19:56.350
It's where Rudder is now.

19:56.370 --> 19:58.693
What they had was a movie.

19:58.713 --> 19:59.714
Hall, they had movies there.

20:02.156 --> 20:04.639
Afternoons and at night.

20:05.598 --> 20:07.941
in the afternoons, on the weekends, I might say.

20:08.122 --> 20:13.830
You certainly never considered going to a movie during the week.

20:13.870 --> 20:17.295
There was never any time to go to a movie.

20:17.395 --> 20:20.820
I never went to a movie during the week.

20:21.882 --> 20:26.669
But they stopped the movie to announce about Pearl Harbor.

20:28.412 --> 20:31.256
And I don't remember what the movie was.

20:31.276 --> 20:31.877
I forgot what it was.

20:31.917 --> 20:34.120
Do you remember what that announcement said?

20:35.011 --> 20:52.717
I just remember that they broke in and didn't have any editorializing about it at all and said that reports had come across that there was no word from President Roosevelt.

20:52.737 --> 21:00.769
But the words had come to them, to A&M, that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor.

21:00.789 --> 21:02.711
Now, afternoon or night when you heard this?

21:02.852 --> 21:03.853
Throughout noon.

21:04.357 --> 21:05.600
So that's Sunday.

21:06.983 --> 21:12.495
Did you hear the Roosevelt speech the next day on the radio to Congress?

21:12.956 --> 21:13.417
Yeah.

21:13.437 --> 21:17.927
Where were you when you heard that?

21:19.747 --> 21:22.449
I don't remember, but I remember hearing it.

21:23.370 --> 21:24.932
I must have been in my room.

21:24.952 --> 21:30.337
Do you remember any discussion in your room or anywhere else that Sunday night or Monday night?

21:30.357 --> 21:34.661
Yeah, we talked about what effect that might have on us.

21:35.101 --> 21:36.322
What did you think it would?

21:36.502 --> 21:41.167
And it didn't really concern me that much.

21:42.348 --> 21:48.994
I knew that it was not good, but I didn't really think about how it would affect me.

21:49.919 --> 21:52.262
I was too busy trying to stay alive.

21:53.344 --> 22:02.636
What was the general opinion of you and your friends as to who was going to win that war?

22:02.656 --> 22:03.397
Were you in doubt?

22:03.797 --> 22:08.964
No, I just, I really, I don't recall what we said about that.

22:10.266 --> 22:17.495
I'm sure we had a Japanese in our outfit.

22:17.515 --> 22:18.677
Tell me about that.

22:19.518 --> 22:21.259
He was a nice guy.

22:21.680 --> 22:26.964
Was he American or Japanese national?

22:26.984 --> 22:31.388
He was American, but he was of Japanese descent.

22:31.408 --> 22:37.393
And I think they put his parents in jail.

22:37.413 --> 22:39.695
He was in California.

22:40.816 --> 22:43.378
How was he treated?

22:43.398 --> 22:45.700
I'm sure he was not treated very well.

22:45.720 --> 22:46.821
You don't remember?

22:46.901 --> 22:48.322
No, I really don't.

22:48.342 --> 22:49.103
I remember him.

22:49.977 --> 22:59.707
And I don't remember, I think he left school because of his parents and I don't know.

23:02.269 --> 23:07.214
Tell me about the protest organizations on the campus against the war.

23:09.316 --> 23:12.900
Oh shoot, are you kidding?

23:13.140 --> 23:17.945
There never has been a protest organization during my time at A&M.

23:18.085 --> 23:19.967
Alright, let's pursue them.

23:20.183 --> 23:26.872
How did your routine of the campus and so forth begin to change after December 7th?

23:30.476 --> 23:35.683
Well, nothing really changed the rest of that year.

23:39.928 --> 23:45.575
Of course, we kept up with the war every now and then.

23:45.655 --> 23:46.917
How'd you keep up with it?

23:47.555 --> 23:51.620
Newspapers are just talking about it.

23:51.641 --> 23:52.942
Radio, I guess.

23:54.965 --> 24:03.717
But we didn't, you know, I can't tell you how busy we were.

24:03.997 --> 24:16.654
I mean, how there was no time to sit down and reflect or think about anything other than your own life.

24:16.674 --> 24:17.275
You know, just...

24:17.525 --> 24:23.150
Just keeping up with what was going on.

24:23.431 --> 24:28.095
When did that three semester a year routine begin?

24:28.115 --> 24:45.051
Well, that... I really don't remember the exact time, but it was all confusing, you know.

24:45.487 --> 24:54.718
We got around and we were kind of excited because we were closer to boots, to wearing boots, you know.

24:55.859 --> 24:56.600
We had the juniors.

24:58.322 --> 25:05.530
I was a sergeant on the course staff.

25:05.550 --> 25:13.840
And we kept thinking, you know, we're going to...

25:14.393 --> 25:21.040
That was the main thing is when we were going to get those boots and we never got them.

25:21.060 --> 25:22.041
The boots went to war.

25:22.702 --> 25:42.544
I remember very distinctly going to a meeting in front of the chemistry building and Dean Bolton got out there and told us that there was a meeting of the junior class

25:43.790 --> 25:50.798
And he said that there would be no boots for the junior class and we could leather it going to war.

25:52.160 --> 25:56.085
So that was a blow, a big blow.

25:56.105 --> 25:57.326
All right, what about senior rings?

25:57.947 --> 25:59.589
We got the rings.

25:59.609 --> 26:01.191
We got the rings.

26:01.211 --> 26:02.492
We got the rings.

26:02.552 --> 26:05.836
You don't remember what it cost?

26:09.321 --> 26:10.842
I think it was $30.

26:10.862 --> 26:13.105
And how many seniors bought a ring?

26:13.709 --> 26:15.251
What percentage do you think?

26:15.271 --> 26:15.872
You know, I don't know.

26:15.892 --> 26:16.693
I think all of it.

26:16.773 --> 26:18.075
I think it's near 100%.

26:18.376 --> 26:22.081
Somehow or other they've got enough money to buy that name.

26:22.101 --> 26:23.944
And what jewelry store?

26:28.610 --> 26:29.612
You know, I don't know.

26:29.652 --> 26:31.554
Well, I think it was through the campus.

26:31.574 --> 26:32.876
I don't believe it ever.

26:32.916 --> 26:34.739
No, we didn't go to the stores yet.

26:35.119 --> 26:40.147
It was a place that you gave the school the money and the school had the rings.

26:40.227 --> 26:41.168
You can't just get them.

26:41.435 --> 26:43.638
You couldn't go in and buy any ring.

26:43.658 --> 26:47.643
When could you get your senior ring?

26:50.446 --> 26:52.188
When could you get them?

26:52.248 --> 26:55.853
When were you eligible to buy your senior ring?

26:55.873 --> 27:01.760
Well, at the end of our junior year, which was not a year.

27:01.820 --> 27:05.504
It was mixed up, you know, because we were around.

27:05.525 --> 27:05.945
Alright.

27:06.346 --> 27:10.851
In terms of behavior patterns and events,

27:11.354 --> 27:19.681
As the war progressed and you all got near it to graduation and departure, did things become more serious on the campus?

27:19.701 --> 27:22.044
Yeah, it became a lot more serious then.

27:22.224 --> 27:33.073
We understood that the seniors before us were getting close and they were going to get their commissions.

27:33.974 --> 27:40.500
And the next sweat was, were we going to be able to get our commissions?

27:41.206 --> 27:49.016
The word was, you know, an iffy situation.

27:49.036 --> 27:55.024
And if I'm not mistaken, it was the Battle of the Bulge that did it for us.

27:56.125 --> 28:05.458
When that happened, people going to school didn't count anymore.

28:06.779 --> 28:09.643
I mean, that was a nervous time for them.

28:10.822 --> 28:20.838
press in the Army and they decided that everybody going to school better get on with it.

28:20.858 --> 28:30.174
So they took the class of 44 and the class of 46, I mean 44 and 45 out.

28:31.135 --> 28:33.379
One night we got on the train.

28:33.399 --> 28:36.424
How did you learn that you were going?

28:39.020 --> 28:42.023
It was just, we were notified.

28:46.989 --> 28:48.670
No, I don't really remember how we were notified.

28:48.891 --> 28:51.554
Do you remember how much lead time you had?

28:51.594 --> 28:53.115
No, no time at all.

28:53.676 --> 28:55.137
It was no time at all.

28:55.157 --> 28:59.943
I mean, we were told one day, as I recall, we went the next evening.

28:59.963 --> 29:02.646
Do you remember what time of the year that was?

29:03.587 --> 29:03.947
Summer.

29:05.294 --> 29:07.316
It was in a summer period.

29:07.536 --> 29:10.320
1943.

29:10.620 --> 29:16.046
And so you had been at A&M three years.

29:16.126 --> 29:16.747
Three years.

29:18.469 --> 29:20.171
But I was 14 hours short.

29:21.212 --> 29:22.573
Of being a senior.

29:22.593 --> 29:22.834
Yeah.

29:23.294 --> 29:34.947
Actually, this was at the end of a semester because I didn't

29:35.281 --> 29:39.588
I don't, we had not gone to class in our last semester yet.

29:40.329 --> 29:42.252
This was the end of the semester.

29:42.272 --> 29:46.299
So the whole, I think the whole country had done what we had done.

29:46.379 --> 29:51.327
Everybody in ROTCs around the country were going full time to school.

29:51.667 --> 29:55.774
Right, and you all packed up and got on the train where?

29:56.615 --> 29:57.677
In College Station.

29:57.697 --> 29:59.179
The train pulled up right there.

29:59.750 --> 30:02.715
And the class of 44 and 45 got on board.

30:02.736 --> 30:04.579
We went to San Antonio.

30:04.879 --> 30:05.340
As a group?

30:05.621 --> 30:06.402
As a group.

30:06.422 --> 30:07.605
And you reported to where?

30:07.985 --> 30:09.228
San Antonio.

30:09.248 --> 30:09.708
One of them?

30:10.029 --> 30:10.530
Fort Sam.

30:10.650 --> 30:11.191
Fort Sam.

30:11.211 --> 30:12.293
Fort Sam Houston.

30:12.313 --> 30:12.634
Okay.

30:13.936 --> 30:16.401
What were your feelings as you were leaving?

30:16.421 --> 30:18.665
Well, it was just kind of a kick.

30:18.946 --> 30:19.767
We...

30:20.962 --> 30:26.208
Nobody really talked about going to war or anything like that.

30:26.228 --> 30:27.930
I mean, we were just going on another court trip.

30:27.950 --> 30:31.153
I mean, it was just, it was kind of fun.

30:31.214 --> 30:35.739
We had a great time and we got to San Antonio.

30:35.759 --> 30:38.762
They had never seen anything like us before over there.

30:38.782 --> 30:48.593
I mean, they were dealing with raw recruits off the farms in the big cities of Texas and they didn't know the first thing about anything.

30:48.613 --> 30:50.395
And when the sergeant said,

30:50.965 --> 30:54.108
hill to land that everybody did.

30:54.128 --> 30:56.351
Think about not doing that.

30:56.371 --> 30:59.895
Well, we certainly, it didn't take us very long to find the holes.

31:00.656 --> 31:04.560
And we found a lot of holes in the air security over there.

31:04.600 --> 31:12.529
And I bet you, the time I was there, after the first week, I spent very few nights at Port Sam.

31:12.549 --> 31:16.894
I stayed with my buddy, Travis Parker, in San Antonio.

31:16.914 --> 31:19.977
And his parents were so nice and

31:20.412 --> 31:23.218
John Hutchins was another good friend of mine from San Antonio.

31:23.258 --> 31:27.548
They lived next door to each other, and I was at one of those houses every night.

31:28.189 --> 31:36.227
And in the morning, there would be, say, 200 would meet here and 200 more.
