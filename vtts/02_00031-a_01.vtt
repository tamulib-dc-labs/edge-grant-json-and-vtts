WEBVTT

00:07.388 --> 00:09.928
One two, one two, one two, one two, one two. One two.

00:16.703 --> 00:40.211
This is October the 4th, and at Wednesday 
afternoon, sitting in the nice, quiet, cool

00:16.703 --> 00:40.211
living room, family room at 1502 Glade, getting 
ready to talk to Dr. Charles Bridges about his

00:16.703 --> 00:40.211
experiences, particularly as a faculty member 
here at Texas A&M. To introduce yourself, on tape

00:44.193 --> 00:52.902
and later in transcript, describe where you grew 
up, went to high school, then to college. In other

00:53.582 --> 00:58.107
words, quickly get us to where you come here to be a 
faculty member. I actually was a high school

00:59.829 --> 01:13.002
student at Webster, Texas, up through the ninth 
grade, and my father transferred to Jasper County

00:59.829 --> 01:13.002
in 1937. and where I finished two years there at 
Jasper High School. And that move was a little bit

01:21.503 --> 01:33.776
upsetting, as many would expect, and it took me two 
years before I could get at it. One day a friend of

01:35.518 --> 01:40.103
mine came by and said, come go with us. I said, where 
are you going? He said, we're going to A&M. I

01:45.998 --> 01:47.421
thought about that a while. I said, when are you 
doing this and what are you going to do?

01:54.351 --> 01:55.733
I decided I'd go with it. He said, what are you going 
to take? I said, what are you taking? He said,

02:00.000 --> 02:01.402
veterinary medicine. I said, okay. Now what year 
was that? That was 1941, September 1941. and

02:10.576 --> 02:16.484
things just took their own life from that point 
because it was a challenge to take. I'd always been

02:16.585 --> 02:25.397
interested in academia and I was interested in 
your experience as a Rice President. When I was at

02:25.417 --> 02:32.828
Webster, my mentor there would program me to go to 
Rice. My move then from there changed all that.

02:38.217 --> 02:39.358
Let's slow down then. If you got here in 41, that's 
too important.

02:44.925 --> 02:48.328
Let's concentrate on your student years. We might 
come back another day and do facts. What did you

02:51.752 --> 02:55.256
know about Texas A&M before you got here? I knew 
very little about Texas A&M. At Jasper, there was

03:00.823 --> 03:06.289
not a lot of promotion of the colleges. As a matter 
of fact, The students really promoted business

03:08.356 --> 03:14.026
schools in Beaumont and things like that. And a few 
of the classmates attended A&M because they were

03:15.289 --> 03:22.763
related. For example, two of them were involved by 
working in veterinary clinics and things like

03:22.803 --> 03:32.220
that and had more of a

03:35.373 --> 03:38.777
And I said, well, that might be all right. Had you 
ever been over here to visit? I'd never been here to

03:40.779 --> 03:42.741
visit. And I had made an application when I got the 
county judge to give me a letter of

03:42.761 --> 03:56.116
recommendation, which is not unusual in small 
towns like that. And I did not have a lot of family

03:56.136 --> 04:01.762
because they wanted me to stay around. I was the 
only kid. son. And what did your family do for a

04:05.556 --> 04:07.458
living? Well, my father worked for Harris County 
Probation Department for years until he went to

04:08.679 --> 04:33.004
Jasper and there he had built a home and he did the 
variety work, worked in carpentry and had his

04:08.679 --> 04:33.004
little farm, as a lot of people do, as kind of a 
supplement with working hours and things like

04:08.679 --> 04:33.004
this. Describe, you came over with some friends in 
a car? When we came to register, yes. That was the

04:41.356 --> 04:43.099
only time. What did you bring with you? Describe 
all of the, or how little, whatever it was. Well, I

04:49.967 --> 04:52.309
don't remember that I brought very much. I 
remember that I came in and this individual was the

04:52.510 --> 04:58.617
same straight as I was. He wasn't economically 
endowed and He had been working the student labor,

05:03.460 --> 05:16.995
and he had a room with Mr. Myers out at the East Gate 
in the attic, and that's where I spent the first few

05:03.460 --> 05:16.995
times. So then I went to, after that he introduced 
me to student employment. I forget the name of it

05:22.882 --> 05:26.506
now, man and gentleman. And so I went there, and he 
first gave me a job or two, I remember, One day

05:33.363 --> 05:46.984
during the ball game, I was mowing Peggy Down's 
yard and somebody just kind of, without a real

05:33.363 --> 05:46.984
strong support, would do. And then I later got a job 
with the housing office and Mr. Harry Boya and the

05:47.404 --> 05:57.700
commandant's office. where I worked and actually 
I don't know whether I have a guard group now or not,

05:59.013 --> 06:08.227
but I was one of the participants in controlling 
that. Do you remember what the pay was for those

06:09.690 --> 06:11.993
early jobs?

06:16.260 --> 06:17.922
Well, there was many jobs. I ran the newsstand at 
Sabeza. At the same time, worked and ran messages

06:24.443 --> 06:30.973
out of the guard room for students in the halls who 
kept their telephones down. This was all the time

06:32.094 --> 06:34.137
you were a freshman? Yeah. Now, and where were you 
living? I was in Ross Hall. Describe your room.

06:41.468 --> 06:45.795
What was in it and what furnishings and... We had a 
typical dorm room. We had the bunk beds with the

06:45.815 --> 06:53.927
hard wooden chairs and And that was a desk, it was a 
table mainly, and that was about it. And of course

07:00.616 --> 07:12.650
there was a telephone there, and we answered the 
telephone, because what happened was the

07:00.616 --> 07:12.650
Operation Brian would call and say, would you go 
get so-and-so to get done with the telephone?

07:12.670 --> 07:19.198
Because in those days, students would get 
adjusted to the telephone array in the dorms,

07:12.670 --> 07:19.198
they'd throw them off and tear them off the wall. 
Was that the only telephone on your floor? The

07:24.282 --> 07:45.238
telephone cordon, well the four involved the 
housing of the Commandant's office, and then our

07:24.282 --> 07:45.238
room, and I forget, the Commandant and the 
housing, Harry Boyer's office was the housing.

07:46.160 --> 07:46.881
Boyer?

07:49.358 --> 08:00.871
Describe how you got put into some outfit and how 
you and your fish buddies were treated in that

07:49.358 --> 08:00.871
outfit. I would have to tell you that it was 
different not being living in the dorm. I was an

08:08.781 --> 08:14.387
on-campus day student, you might say. And I was 
assigned to A Troop, 1st Cavalry, and later,

08:15.143 --> 08:27.657
probably out of disgrace, pushed into Machine Gun 
Troop. What, did it have a number, name? No, it was

08:29.760 --> 08:34.305
just Machine Gun Troop and A Troop.

08:36.487 --> 08:40.512
But you were in the Corps and wore a uniform, 
weren't you? Oh, yes. That's one reason I couldn't

08:41.072 --> 08:45.117
tell you how much I brought with me, We were issued a 
certain number of trousers and shirts and what

08:45.417 --> 08:52.925
have you. Otherwise, I participated. Other than 
that, I didn't live in a dorm. Describe your first

08:58.511 --> 09:01.113
fall. Describe a typical day. What times did you 
get up? What did you do when? Take from getting up

09:08.001 --> 09:13.146
all the way through that day.

09:16.602 --> 09:21.547
I used to go to the 80 out and have a little trouble 
with some of this.

09:24.690 --> 09:45.732
We would rise and clean straight up our rooms and 
take whatever's left there and then actually, as

09:24.690 --> 09:45.732
much as I was working multiple jobs, most of the 
time I would go and dust the Commandant's office

09:24.690 --> 09:45.732
because I'd swept it the night before. And then 
come back and go eat at Sabisa and then back to the

09:47.146 --> 09:58.302
room and go to classes. Did you fall in and march to 
Chao? No. But you ate in Sabisa. Did you eat with an

10:04.992 --> 10:06.454
outfit?

10:10.990 --> 10:11.290
No. The best restaurant I remember, but I don't 
remember. Okay. All right. Because most of the

10:15.174 --> 10:29.949
time, for example, I ate on the leg table, for 
example, in the evenings, and that was great

10:15.174 --> 10:29.949
because we would usually go to one of the athletes 
that had eaten and would have multiple pies and all

10:15.174 --> 10:29.949
the steaks we would eat. And that first fall, do you 
remember the courses, some of the courses, some of

10:29.969 --> 10:37.757
the teachers you had that first fall?

10:42.749 --> 10:44.991
English, math, science? Yes, I remember some of 
the English, and that was tough.

10:53.381 --> 10:58.747
I had always been a pretty good student, and yet not 
challenged very much. Those were different

10:59.027 --> 11:00.829
times. And as you know, the English department 
took no prisoners.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.402
I don't remember that. The

11:13.158 --> 11:20.649
math, I forget what it was, really. I remember more 
about the biology and the old building over there.

11:26.879 --> 11:28.481
Do you remember who the biology teacher was? I can 
remember him now. I can't put a name onto him. I just

11:35.092 --> 11:35.933
offhand. Were all the courses tough in terms of 
grades? Those, actually, I did much like I did in

11:42.875 --> 11:47.161
high school. I floated through because I had major 
problems and working schedule I had and not having

11:47.241 --> 11:55.512
the time for corrected glasses. I would go to eat on 
the lake table, eat too much, get a quart of coffee

11:55.532 --> 12:08.731
to bring back to the room and take a nap and get up and 
drink that quart of coffee almost and then study 30

11:55.532 --> 12:08.731
minutes and that was it. The rest of it I got to 
class. All right. In the afternoons, did you have

12:12.068 --> 12:15.633
any spare time? Or were you working just about all? 
Well, it was working most of the time, yeah. It was

12:24.427 --> 12:36.324
after they sent his classes over that it was to the 
janitor's job and most of that, and then back to the

12:24.427 --> 12:36.324
road and whatever came. Did you make some close 
friends that first year? Well, I had a lot of

12:41.043 --> 12:55.567
acquaintances, and yes,

12:41.043 --> 12:55.567
I kept so many of them that's gone by that I've 
continued to have relations with them. I don't

12:55.647 --> 13:00.655
remember a lot of them I had. There was not time for

13:01.096 --> 13:07.506
having fun, you might say. Did you and the other 
fish get hazed? Some, yes. Describe. Well, the

13:18.109 --> 13:24.076
hazing was usually, I have to say I was in a unique 
situation. Being working for the commandant's

13:24.216 --> 13:33.607
office, I had a certain unasked for immunity.

13:36.510 --> 13:38.893
So that made some difference, I think. Did you and 
your buddies ever pull off any pranks or play

13:40.139 --> 13:48.712
tricks on anybody? Oh, there was a little floating 
out of people, individuals, and stuff like that.

13:56.263 --> 14:00.309
But, say, my life as a cadet was not the usual. In 
other words, in a company, a troop, and what have

14:01.230 --> 14:09.623
you. Two years old. Older than anybody else. As a 
matter of fact, I was of the age of the juniors and

14:13.884 --> 14:16.387
seniors. And I guess my attitude may have 
reflected it. And not intentionally, but... And

14:22.296 --> 14:29.266
that fall, there was a good football team here. Did 
you go to all the games? Very few of them, really.

14:36.477 --> 14:37.419
How often did you go home? About once a month. How 
would you get there? I would go out to Eastgate and

14:41.831 --> 14:51.441
stand in line with a thumb, and I would get a ride 
into Houston, and with a dime, I'd go across

14:41.831 --> 14:51.441
Houston. I'd ride to get a ride to Beaumont, and 
with a dime, I'd get across Beaumont, and then I

14:52.763 --> 15:00.991
would hitchhike home. And sometimes getting out 
late, I had to look for a ride, and we were there five

15:01.011 --> 15:07.318
miles out of town. But it was, it was interesting. 
Reckon how long it took to catch a ride from here to

15:12.071 --> 15:15.675
Jasper?

15:18.457 --> 15:21.220
It was very, fairly fast considering. I'm saying 
this, there was no time much spent except standing

15:21.240 --> 15:26.705
in line. And of course sighted traffic was pretty 
good along that Highway 6. Did you ever have any

15:33.091 --> 15:37.575
interesting experiences hitchhiking? Well,

15:39.817 --> 15:46.666
occasionally. I had a few girls try to pick me up in 
Houston and places like that, and of course I was

15:47.647 --> 15:57.340
headed home and there were other interests there. 
But you never had any negative, no troubles, no

15:58.161 --> 16:03.548
problems? No, not yet. In other words, a young 
person, this is all new experience. I did get into

16:10.107 --> 16:19.600
outside of Beaumont one time and had a ride with a 
trucker and I asked him where he was going. He said,

16:19.700 --> 16:20.481
New Orleans. I said, can I go?

16:26.670 --> 16:29.854
So I ended up in New Orleans.

16:31.522 --> 16:37.969
So far, I've not recorded a single negative Aggie 
hitchhiking experience. No. And you always wore

16:38.870 --> 16:41.213
your uniform hitchhiking? Always. There was no 
other way. In those days, if you weren't in the

16:44.477 --> 16:52.285
service, at our age, there was a question about 
you. And I think that young men, particularly in

16:52.305 --> 16:59.233
those days, were very conscious of that. Now, did 
you and your buddies become part of the Aggie

17:00.530 --> 17:06.379
slang? Did you all have the names for food? Oh, yes, 
always. What was your favorite Aggie chow food,

17:11.026 --> 17:15.012
chow hall food? What was it? Steak. Chicken fried? 
A lot of times it was just grilled. Grilled?

17:22.763 --> 17:25.447
Anything that you didn't like? Yeah, ribs. The 
ribs? The ribs. And was there always plenty of

17:30.164 --> 17:32.226
food? Well, yes, always plenty of food. No problem 
there. Did your outfit get together and do

17:40.295 --> 17:47.202
anything as a group?

17:49.225 --> 17:50.466
I can't remember that part. What about December 7, 
1941? Do you remember that day? Yes, I was at Ross

17:57.035 --> 18:04.583
Hall, and we heard all the gods on the radio. 
Describe that as fully as you can. Well, I can't

18:07.506 --> 18:22.242
remember that well, except it came about, and we 
were concerned, you know, it had all come before

18:07.506 --> 18:22.242
actually conscription had started to mean 
things, and we all had our numbers with the drafts.

18:22.778 --> 18:50.929
and we're concerned about those things and I know 
that I remember when I went there and of course

18:22.778 --> 18:50.929
everybody had to get in the Corps or have a good 
excuse and I had to memorize the eye chart and I

18:22.778 --> 18:50.929
remember A-P-E-O-T-F-D-Z even this day I can 
remember that as being the critical line that one

18:51.618 --> 19:07.563
of my cohorts has helped me memorize and so we were 
concerned about that and I think pretty well

18:51.618 --> 19:07.563
concerned about what was going to happen. Of 
course, it turned out in the end that we were exempt

19:07.644 --> 19:18.621
as students of veterinary medicine and you may 
have known that and Then later, we actually, after

19:19.073 --> 19:28.446
a couple years, we were actually given a 
commission on the basis of our education. All

19:28.466 --> 19:32.451
right, now, but you were a freshman here that first 
year. And you started off majoring in veterinary.

19:39.861 --> 19:41.403
Did they call it pre-vet then? They called it 
pre-vet. Two years? Oh, just one year.

19:51.324 --> 19:59.011
Back to December 7, did you and your buddies listen 
to President Roosevelt when he talked to Congress

19:51.324 --> 19:59.011
that next day? I

19:59.031 --> 20:02.915
don't remember that. Do you remember any changes 
that happened in the routine after the war got

20:03.155 --> 20:10.682
going here?

20:13.665 --> 20:16.047
Were you part of the group that went on the 
trimester? Well, the trimester program, we went

20:16.921 --> 20:22.529
continuously, yes. And

20:22.890 --> 20:29.300
did you go on into the vet school then? Yes. See, I 
was in vet school only three and a half years. It was

20:34.488 --> 20:37.392
a five year program and we completed all that. I was 
a class of 45 as I signed up. And I graduated in

20:44.292 --> 20:47.455
February of 45. As far as you can recall, what kind 
of grades did it take to get into vet school then?

20:55.402 --> 21:07.632
Actually,

20:55.402 --> 21:07.632
as I remember it, you had to maintain a C average to 
make proper progress. And if you didn't flunk out,

21:07.653 --> 21:09.914
you went off. But the classes were restricted to 
100. And so when they adjusted for those that just

21:13.992 --> 21:24.943
didn't make it, then there was no selection 
committee, you could say, other than that. Do you

21:24.963 --> 21:27.465
remember how many entered with you?

21:30.789 --> 21:32.050
No, I don't. And that would have been the fall of 
1942? No, it was, well, actually we knew nothing

21:33.952 --> 21:43.341
about entry of any of them. to the veterinary 
school. You signed up for the program in

21:47.282 --> 21:49.664
veterinary medicine. Oh, and just went right on. 
He just went through. If you didn't flunk out, you

21:52.727 --> 21:55.469
made progress. As I remember it, and the faculties 
of mine in here may have been such a thing. Who was

22:02.135 --> 22:04.718
the dean then? Marsteller was the dean, yeah. 
Describe him, please, as you remember him. Dr.

22:09.763 --> 22:13.446
Marsteller was an aging individual at that time, 
and a very,

22:14.236 --> 22:20.023
well, old gentleman. He was sad and wore, as I 
remember, a mustache. And

22:28.172 --> 22:33.898
jovial at times and otherwise. And the students, 
like they always do, always have opinions. They

22:39.485 --> 22:42.268
say, well, he has good days or he has bad days. And 
that was down in the administration building. The

22:47.378 --> 22:52.023
old administration building on the second floor 
was where his offices were. Now, where and where

22:52.803 --> 22:57.108
was the, and it was the School of Veterinary 
Medicine, wasn't it? Yes. And where was it

22:57.648 --> 22:59.170
located? It occupied a good bit of Francis Hall, 
and a lot of the basic sciences were taught there,

23:01.232 --> 23:11.142
and then what is now, I think, civil engineering 
building down on that northeast corner. And where

23:17.965 --> 23:23.933
were the stalls and all for the animals? The stalls 
were actually to the north of the, and actually

23:24.573 --> 23:33.445
adjacent to the civil engineering building. 
Those buildings are basically there now. They've

23:35.147 --> 23:36.770
been converted. And then all of that area, this 
parking lot now was was horse pasture. And as I

23:44.115 --> 23:58.849
remember when I first came, University Drive was a 
gravel road, and you couldn't ride a bicycle very

23:44.115 --> 23:58.849
well on it because it was large river stones.

23:59.410 --> 24:07.998
And as you remember your classmates in veterinary 
medicine, were most of them country boys or city

23:59.410 --> 24:07.998
boys? I think it varied considerably, yeah. I 
never

24:11.956 --> 24:18.304
knew a lot. The only things I recognized, be it a 
country boy for example, would be the people from

24:18.364 --> 24:36.466
West Texas, which were ranchers and they actually 
were, set themselves apart because they were kind

24:18.364 --> 24:36.466
of cowboy types and what have you. Did you make some 
close friends early on in veterinary medicine?

24:42.871 --> 24:43.992
Who were some of those? Well, I had a boy named Mike 
who was recently deceased. What's his name? Born

24:50.261 --> 25:02.237
in Myatt, M-Y-A-T-T.

24:50.261 --> 25:02.237
Of course, I came over here with Leland Grumbles, 
who is now retired and was head of microbiology.

25:03.618 --> 25:10.988
Actually, I lived in the same community.

25:14.326 --> 25:18.730
Charlie Boyd was in my class. We were pretty close. 
We never did room together. Once you entered the

25:21.793 --> 25:28.158
vet school, did you remain in the Corps? Oh, yes. 
Well, we remained in the Corps until 43. Okay. And

25:34.444 --> 25:38.427
we completed all the basic ROTC. And then they 
developed this

25:45.072 --> 26:09.898
to, I think, some way or another, they got the, that 
the veterinary students, they were inactive,

25:45.072 --> 26:09.898
they had to conserve that because at that time they 
were, they had a heavy war over in India and China,

25:45.072 --> 26:09.898
and horse-drawn material, and the veterinarians 
were considered to be a kind of an important

25:45.072 --> 26:09.898
resource, according to that time. Plus the fact 
that food services, the food inspection service,

26:14.131 --> 26:31.517
that they, to form a way of giving them immunity

26:14.131 --> 26:31.517
from being called in, they were commissioned, 
second lieutenant in the medical administrative

26:14.131 --> 26:31.517
corps. Now, as you began your veterinary studies, 
was there any ceremony? to welcome you first-year

26:37.469 --> 26:39.391
students? No. You just started. We were there. You 
were there. To whom did you and your friends turn

26:44.657 --> 26:47.940
for advice? What courses to take? What to do about 
this? Who was there? We turned to each other, and

26:55.248 --> 27:00.073
actually the curriculum was pretty well set. It's 
in the catalog, and you took it. Okay. The only

27:04.604 --> 27:12.192
advice you could get is, what can I get away with, 
because I didn't make this course. I'd have had

27:12.212 --> 27:21.982
that problem, but there was no counseling as such 
that I know of. How rigorous, how demanding were

27:22.002 --> 27:32.333
the courses in medicine compared with what you'd 
had before?

27:33.899 --> 27:37.344
I never felt they were demanding in a way. A lot of 
them I did not excel in. But a lot of my problems was

27:41.530 --> 27:44.054
time. And I teetered along just on the brink a good 
bit.

27:57.093 --> 27:59.096
Were you paying your own way? Oh, yes. Okay. $23 a 
month, and that took care of it. I worked two years

28:04.679 --> 28:18.578
with the Agricultural Adjustment 
Administration in the county and saved money up

28:04.679 --> 28:18.578
and I gave my dad some and I talked him into buying a 
car and I gave him part of that to cover that and

28:04.679 --> 28:18.578
left. And they'd send me $15, $20 occasionally. 
About how many of your friends had enough money

28:26.262 --> 28:30.771
that they didn't have to work? About what 
percentage worked and didn't work? What percent

28:33.716 --> 28:35.239
had a job here? I would not want to be checked on 
that, but I would say that 30 or 40 percent of them

28:36.963 --> 28:43.215
had to work. Yeah, I'm going to at least that.

28:50.528 --> 29:04.267
All right, and so you all go year-round then to 
classes, and did any of many of your friends drop

28:50.528 --> 29:04.267
out and go volunteer, or did they stay pretty well? 
You all stayed pretty well together. There was an

29:07.732 --> 29:20.029
option there that was offered, and some of them did 
take that option to go on, and what happened was

29:07.732 --> 29:20.029
they had a... Most of them took the commissions and 
then when they developed the Army Student

29:22.439 --> 29:47.250
Training Program, the STP, they went for a year and 
then they decided that

29:22.439 --> 29:47.250
we're not going to be needing these people. That 
they all gave them the option of leaving that and

29:52.544 --> 30:00.038
going on to do the service from there, or else just 
dropping out and continuing school. And there

30:00.058 --> 30:06.229
were a few then that took that option, joining the 
Navy or what have you.

30:09.235 --> 30:14.805
Then you reported for active duty when?

30:16.878 --> 30:26.434
Well, after we resigned our commission and 
accepted this program, that was in June of 43. You

30:26.955 --> 30:30.200
had already graduated? No. Oh. We had a year to go. 
June of 43, I was two years to go.

30:47.118 --> 30:50.041
But in June of 43, this program started. And then in 
44, it ended. And then we got out and continued

30:54.967 --> 30:59.632
school. And we were all into a company, ASTP.

31:11.726 --> 31:13.007
So you graduated when?

31:15.890 --> 31:19.275
Was there a big ceremony, commencement? You know, 
I don't even remember being there. That's how

31:23.442 --> 31:25.165
significant it was. So you don't remember where 
the family came or? Oh, no, they didn't come. Okay.

31:30.413 --> 31:32.717
And then you reported for active duty?
