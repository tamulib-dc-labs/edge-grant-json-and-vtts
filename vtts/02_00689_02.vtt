WEBVTT

00:01.162 --> 00:31.050
I will have my outer office packed with those 
students whose names are in that little box and I

00:01.162 --> 00:31.050
need to see those students face to face 
individually and what I do with them then I say let

00:01.162 --> 00:31.050
me see your schedule let me see why you have to have 
this course and I try to substitute a course now

00:01.162 --> 00:31.050
this is after Donna Wiseman and Dave Armstrong 
have worked with these kids initially so you can

00:01.162 --> 00:31.050
see we have some layers but It gets to the point 
where I have to say, I'm sorry, I think that you'll

00:31.317 --> 00:43.709
need to take this course in the fall and try to find a 
substitute course because you're not going to be

00:31.317 --> 00:43.709
student teaching until the fall of 89. And isn't 
that adding another incredible burden to you

00:43.769 --> 00:50.255
right now, not knowing the outcome of this 
decision? I mean, how can you make those decisions

00:50.275 --> 00:54.138
without even knowing what kind of program you're 
going to have? We know our present program will be

00:54.459 --> 00:58.202
in place until 1991. And all of our students who 
came in in the fall must be graduated by 1991 under

00:58.672 --> 01:07.848
the old, under the present program. If they are 
not, they won't be able to be certified. What was I

01:12.757 --> 01:18.487
hearing about, you know, we have to have something 
by January because this new thing is going to have

01:12.757 --> 01:18.487
to be implemented in September? We have to have 
something in place by January. in order to get it

01:20.930 --> 01:28.861
through the university curriculum committees 
and be approved so we can have a new program in place

01:20.930 --> 01:28.861
by September. For the ones that are coming in in 88? 
Exactly. Because, you see, they will be the

01:33.106 --> 01:35.350
graduating class of 92. So our department will not 
only have the management problems we presently

01:37.032 --> 01:49.789
face, but we are going to be serving two programs at 
one time for the next three years. And this will be

01:52.301 --> 01:54.744
just your department, pretty much, won't it? I 
mean, it'll affect this one the majority. It'll

01:56.667 --> 02:03.657
affect, for example, educational psychology 
would be affected by those service courses that

01:56.667 --> 02:03.657
they have in our program. But our department is the 
greatest affected. And we all have dual programs

02:09.530 --> 02:11.512
going on. What has this done to the climate in your 
department as far as teacher morale or anxiety or

02:11.532 --> 02:19.642
the unknown? The fear of the unknown, I guess, is 
the worst. How do you deal with that as a department

02:23.406 --> 02:26.349
head and manager? How do you manage the people? 
Well, that's part of the management problem. I

02:32.637 --> 02:38.203
think that if you're perceived as trying to 
maintain a class load that is appropriate. For

02:41.873 --> 03:00.204
example, the time I spend with these kids who need 
to get into classes, I do not add a student to a class

02:41.873 --> 03:00.204
except in an emergency, unless a faculty member 
has signed a form accepting the student. Now let me

03:00.224 --> 03:01.005
explain that. If you came to me and you said you 
wanted to get into a class and it was closed I would

03:04.390 --> 03:31.360
say here is a form and you need to take this to 
Professor Alexander and her class is closed and if

03:04.390 --> 03:31.360
she signs her name on this accepting you into that 
class then I will admit you so Pat Alexander has

03:04.390 --> 03:31.360
made the decision that she will take that 31st 
student into her class then I put that person in now

03:04.390 --> 03:31.360
for those faculty who are too soft-hearted, I 
sometimes have to stop and say, you know, even the

03:32.150 --> 03:38.378
form isn't going to do. We simply can't. The 
instruction is going to be affected. So that I

03:41.743 --> 03:48.772
think in that way, the faculty understands that 
I'm just not sitting here and adding 47 kids to your

03:41.743 --> 03:48.772
class. It's their decision first. And if there's 
an emergency, then I may call and say, Pat, we have a

03:50.655 --> 03:57.825
student who's doing student teaching next 
semester. Yours is the only class. Is there any

03:59.507 --> 04:01.009
possibility we can get her in? And so I might do a 
face-to-face or a telephone conversation with a

04:01.563 --> 04:05.388
faculty member. Then that kind of leads me into all 
these changes and all the things that are

04:06.209 --> 04:17.845
happening are going to impact, obviously, the 
future and what the College of Education will be in

04:06.209 --> 04:17.845
the 21st century. And I see that you had some notes 
in there. Do you have a crystal ball to what you feel

04:19.948 --> 04:24.354
like? I think we've covered most of these. But let 
me share with you, first of all, One of the changes

04:32.596 --> 04:45.588
that I feel very positive about in regard to the 
institution,

04:32.596 --> 04:45.588
and that is the special effort that is being made 
for the recruitment of minorities. And I'm very,

04:47.891 --> 04:58.941
I'm going to be very point about that, I'm very 
proud of the fact that we now have in place an

05:00.524 --> 05:03.908
English as a second language teacher preparation 
program.

05:06.750 --> 05:09.353
Dean came here in 1980, I came here in 1981. I knew 
something about Texas and I knew something about

05:10.675 --> 05:14.138
the makeup of Texas. And so I was quite surprised, 
I'd say relatively surprised, that when I came

05:14.779 --> 05:30.295
here we did not have any program in the department 
that addressed the needs of the minorities in the

05:14.779 --> 05:30.295
state of Texas.

05:30.663 --> 05:35.068
The first individual that was recruited in this 
department was Dr. . And she was recruited to

05:35.088 --> 05:42.377
develop a program in ESL bilingual education. She 
has done a superb job in that regard. And she's

05:48.144 --> 05:49.206
another individual. She got the Outstanding New 
Faculty Award, and this year she got the Teaching

05:49.226 --> 05:54.392
Award. And do you know that she has submitted 13 
proposals in the short time she has been here? And

06:02.379 --> 06:05.482
has a number of those, I think eight of those were 
funded. We are now, we have Dr. Gracilia Pena

06:06.964 --> 06:14.312
Rosenberg, who will be coming to us in January to 
help us in our bilingual program. We've gotten

06:15.813 --> 06:18.096
that program off the ground. We had very few women 
in our department. We now have added women to our

06:24.342 --> 06:25.844
program. We have two black females. And we've 
added, I guess what I'm saying is that I feel very

06:31.231 --> 06:43.108
proud of the fact that we are addressing the kinds 
of needs that I think Texas has had for a long time in

06:31.231 --> 06:43.108
teacher preparation, and that is role models. And 
I think the institution is moving in that

06:43.128 --> 06:46.232
direction. And I'm very pleased with that. We have 
a minority mentorship program that we have just

06:48.835 --> 06:55.042
developed for our undergraduate teacher 
preparation program. And Dr. Patricia Lark, who

06:56.484 --> 07:03.592
is our minority, and Dr. Donna Wiseman have put 
this program together. And what that program

07:05.173 --> 07:15.645
entails is that we have enlisted the help of 
minority community leaders in the Bryan College

07:05.173 --> 07:15.645
Station area to help us screen about 30 elementary 
education majors into this program. And these

07:26.636 --> 07:42.611
elementary education majors will be serving as 
mentors to the same number of elementary students

07:26.636 --> 07:42.611
in Bryan College Station who are in the sixth, 
seventh, and eighth grades. They will be These

07:44.617 --> 07:53.286
students have been identified by these community 
leaders as having parental support for education

07:44.617 --> 07:53.286
and academic promise. And what we hope will happen 
is that our mentors, by working with them, will

07:54.487 --> 08:11.265
help them to achieve academic success in the 
sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, which will

07:54.487 --> 08:11.265
build them a foundation for having success in high 
school, which will bring them into the university

07:54.487 --> 08:11.265
level. And at the same time, it's going to 
sensitize our 30 elementary education majors to

08:11.617 --> 08:20.130
working in a multicultural classroom. I'm very 
proud of that program. Would you be willing to

08:20.992 --> 08:22.454
share that model? Because in my new job with this 
office in San Antonio, that's what I'm going to be

08:22.514 --> 08:30.547
doing is working with the 6th, 7th, and 8th 
graders. And that could be a wonderful launching

08:30.607 --> 08:32.470
thing. And we might be able to expand it. OK. Sure. 
Dr. Lahr. OK. Dr. Weitzman. Great. That would be

08:37.738 --> 08:38.940
wonderful. That's one of the things that I'm very 
proud of. I think

08:41.369 --> 09:00.133
another area that I'm very proud of, when I came 
here, we had one computer and one Diablo printer in

08:41.369 --> 09:00.133
this department.

09:00.153 --> 09:00.233
Wow. Every faculty member now has a computer in his 
or her office. Every secretary is computerized,

09:05.600 --> 09:08.944
has a computer. We are on a SIMS, obviously the 
SIMS, which the university now has moved to

09:09.548 --> 09:17.616
computerizing their registration and so forth. 
We have a laser printer. We have a, our curriculum

09:21.540 --> 09:27.947
and our instructional research lab have 
computers in them. What I'm particularly proud of

09:27.967 --> 09:37.817
is that we are on the cutting edge of technology in 
this department so that we are going to be moving to

09:27.967 --> 09:37.817
a new configuration in terms of our support staff 
and how it will be functioning in relation to our

09:38.523 --> 09:49.713
faculty needs that will bring our technology to 
play at the highest level of the state of art. And

09:51.375 --> 09:53.757
we're going to be doing that probably within the 
next year. How did you accomplish all this? With

09:56.860 --> 10:03.125
the help of the faculty, with the fact of using our 
resources wisely. And that's what I'm saying was a

10:03.746 --> 10:07.129
management type of thing. procedure that we went 
through. So I'm kind of proud of that, too. That was

10:10.701 --> 10:12.203
one of the other aspects. And I spoke about 
recruitment of minorities. So what do I see for the

10:17.589 --> 10:20.452
21st century? Well, I think I see something not too 
dissimilar from some ideas that I put forward. I

10:28.460 --> 10:34.267
had an article that I was invited to write for my 
specialty is English education. And an

10:34.867 --> 10:37.470
organization I belong to called Conference on 
English Education. And they had two journals that

10:40.898 --> 10:46.665
they devoted to invited articles, and one journal 
was on needed research. And they asked me to write

10:47.446 --> 10:50.610
an article in that regard. And one of the things I 
said was that I believed that in the very near

10:51.811 --> 11:03.205
future, one of the things that we would be doing in 
teacher education is to try to prepare teacher

11:04.653 --> 11:07.576
scholars who are also researchers. In other 
words, teacher researchers. And I believe that we

11:10.519 --> 11:17.526
are just on the horizon of doing that at Susannan 
University. And it's right in keeping with the

11:17.546 --> 11:29.998
Holmes Group agenda in terms of major research 
institutions becoming involved in teacher

11:17.546 --> 11:29.998
education. That's why I'm so proud of that. I'll 
take a copy of that article. And I think what's

11:34.589 --> 11:53.193
going to happen is that we're going to have much 
more collaboration of our faculty with public

11:34.589 --> 11:53.193
school teachers in the area of classroom research 
so that it's out there where it's taking place. And

11:54.094 --> 12:01.423
I think that we're going to find that our whole 
thrust will be in producing these teacher

12:01.977 --> 12:10.767
scholars who are also researchers, and that our 
faculty are going to build that research base that

12:01.977 --> 12:10.767
our teachers may not have. But the two of them 
together, with the practical experience of a

12:11.088 --> 12:18.496
teacher coupled with the research expertise of 
our faculty, could do wonders. Just do wonders. I

12:19.818 --> 12:21.219
think I see that on our horizon. So you're not 
apprehensive about this new program that is about

12:21.259 --> 12:26.546
to come about? You think that it has a positive? I 
mean, everybody's sold. I think we have an

12:29.469 --> 12:31.191
opportunity. I think I'm optimistic about it. And 
are you able to project that to your faculty? I

12:41.583 --> 12:42.825
think to some degree. I would be less than honest if 
I didn't tell you that there are some faculty that

12:43.025 --> 12:50.156
are reticent about what's happening. They're not 
certain that we have proven that one thing is

12:50.217 --> 12:56.166
better than another. My feeling is we could go on 
for years and never have proof. We have to move

13:00.425 --> 13:01.628
forward. I think the climate now, the educational 
reform is saying, as parents were saying, we

13:03.091 --> 13:14.155
expect our teachers to be fully prepared and to be 
scholars. and to be able to not only make a

13:14.523 --> 13:21.070
diagnosis, but be able to make a remediation if 
that's necessary. And you can't do that unless you

13:21.170 --> 13:23.132
have a scholar researcher. Do you think, though, 
that it's going to affect teacher shortage? I

13:26.215 --> 13:30.119
mean, we already have a teacher shortage, but is 
that going to make it worse? In other words,

13:30.199 --> 13:40.210
prevent people from going into teaching because 
they feel like it's, you know, five years and then

13:30.199 --> 13:40.210
you come out and you're not making as much as... 
That's what I'm hearing from a lot of people. How do

13:43.868 --> 13:45.089
you respond to that? Because I'm having trouble 
responding.

13:49.993 --> 13:55.078
I'm going to say this, and I hope it's taken the 
right way.

13:59.141 --> 14:04.166
I mentioned earlier about my career being spent in 
major research institutions. And I believe Texas

14:05.207 --> 14:09.150
A&M University is such an institution.

14:11.645 --> 14:15.711
And I believe teacher education is part of that 
research agenda.

14:18.735 --> 14:28.550
And our role is to produce the educational leaders 
of tomorrow.

14:32.135 --> 14:40.167
If it has some effect on the numbers that we are able 
to produce, then I say that must be balanced by the

14:41.817 --> 15:02.285
even higher quality of individual we will be 
putting out who will go out there and work with

14:41.817 --> 15:02.285
those people who didn't graduate from Texas A&M 
University and will lead in education and will be

14:41.817 --> 15:02.285
on the cutting edge of what happens. Now, just 
think about what that would mean to this

15:02.325 --> 15:07.412
institution and to education if that were to 
occur. Then we become the seed institution for

15:10.454 --> 15:15.942
educational reform for how many years to come? And 
that's why I'm optimistic. And I think that would

15:17.784 --> 15:30.722
be exciting for a faculty to begin to work with the 
high quality students that we have coming to us and

15:17.784 --> 15:30.722
follow them through into a professional career. 
That's my view. That's a very bright outlook. And I

15:34.307 --> 15:36.410
think that should be appreciated. And I hope that 
everybody would feel that way, because it is. so

15:40.087 --> 15:40.808
important. And I really appreciate your time and 
all of this very good insights because it's a

15:41.289 --> 15:47.501
totally different. No, I really appreciate it. 
And I hope that you let me come back and ask a few

15:49.645 --> 15:55.557
questions as I start to synthesize all of it. I know 
I'll have to.
