00:01.415 --> 00:04.823
Male homosexuals have equal rights. The Supreme 
Court in Bowers v. Hardwick in 1986 refused to

00:05.364 --> 00:19.997
extend the whole notion of the right of privacy to 
homosexual activity, upholding a state law from

00:05.364 --> 00:19.997
Georgia, which made it a crime. for people to 
engage in sexual relations with others of the same

00:20.433 --> 00:25.242
sex. And not all states have such laws. Texas does 
not. In fact, I think the majority of states no

00:30.631 --> 00:34.138
longer do. But they're being told they can't 
enforce them. Homosexuals face discrimination

00:37.844 --> 00:41.631
in child custody. women have lost custody of their 
children because they were lesbians. Now, in at

00:47.010 --> 00:52.297
least 90% of divorces, women retain custody of the 
kids. There just are not enough male homosexuals

00:52.497 --> 01:00.408
who actively sought custody to tell whether 
they're being discriminated against. But there

01:00.709 --> 01:03.973
was at least one case, for example, where a man 
who... had been divorced, was gay, and had

01:05.202 --> 01:26.299
visitation rights, was forbidden to take his 
children to the gay church he attended, even

01:05.202 --> 01:26.299
though that would seem to be in his First Amendment 
religious rights, and was forbidden to let them

01:05.202 --> 01:26.299
have any association with his gay male friends, as 
if they were going to rape his son, which is

01:05.202 --> 01:26.299
ridiculous. Homosexuals face discrimination in 
the workplace, and certainly that has not ever

01:26.701 --> 01:36.536
been addressed by federal laws. One of the 
cruelest forms of discrimination is what arises

01:37.077 --> 01:48.474
from the fact that there is no state anywhere in 
this country in which homosexuals may marry. And

01:48.915 --> 01:55.425
that means that unless you have ordinances or laws 
as we do now in San Francisco, If you are a

01:55.405 --> 01:58.581
homosexual living with your mother, your lover 
cannot be a beneficiary of your health insurance.

02:03.659 --> 02:09.765
Now, you can, with a life insurance policy, 
usually you can name whomever you wish as a

02:03.659 --> 02:09.765
beneficiary. But, for example, if, as often 
happens, two men, say, are living together, and

02:10.045 --> 02:26.982
one of them is employed full-time and the other one 
is a student and doesn't have good health

02:10.045 --> 02:26.982
insurance, the student cannot become, I mean, the 
employed man cannot buy a family insurance and let

02:27.552 --> 02:36.220
his lover be the beneficiary. Whereas if a couple 
are married and one of them is working and the other

02:36.500 --> 02:47.310
is a student, there's no problem at all.

02:47.730 --> 02:55.737
You very frequently have a situation if one

02:47.730 --> 02:55.737
partner dies, and dies without a will, who of 
course the family inherits and may very well push

02:56.189 --> 03:05.286
the lover out of the home in which they've been 
living. That can be remedied by will. There is a

03:07.551 --> 03:13.101
tragic case in Minnesota, although it's been 
resolved very well, fairly well now after a very

03:14.600 --> 03:22.675
long wait, but a couple, Karen Thompson and Sharon 
Kowalski were living together. And Sharon was in a

03:23.156 --> 03:28.946
bad automobile accident and in a coma. And her 
father went to court and got named her guardian. He

03:35.626 --> 03:46.500
forbade Thompson from seeing her, and he put his 
daughter in a nursing home and essentially let her

03:35.626 --> 03:46.500
walk for three and a half years. Not only couldn't 
she see her lover, she didn't even have

03:46.580 --> 03:54.109
rehabilitation, and all this precious time was 
simply lost. And now, a year ago, Thompson won the

03:54.189 --> 03:59.936
right to go to see her, and they were able to 
communicate. She cannot speak, but she does use a

04:00.337 --> 04:03.000
computer. Kowalski rather. Kowalski was able to 
communicate that she wanted to stay with Karen and

04:04.582 --> 04:19.584
then now the father has withdrawn his guardian and 
I think either Thompson is guardian or they've

04:04.582 --> 04:19.584
decided that Kowalski is confident to manage her 
own affairs. But that kind of thing has happened a

04:19.985 --> 04:22.829
lot. With AIDS, very frequently what has happened 
is that a man will get sick and his family

04:31.567 --> 04:45.161
essentially will take over and will treat him 
very, very badly because in some anti-gay

04:31.567 --> 04:45.161
families the attitude has been, you brought this 
on yourself, and they won't let the lovers see the

04:31.567 --> 04:45.161
man. These are things that people can take care of 
by drawing up wills, by drawing up legalized

04:46.283 --> 04:55.212
documents of what they want to happen, but of 
course most people don't do that. Homosexuals

04:55.478 --> 05:03.180
are, in many, many respects, second classes. They 
simply do not have the rights that heterosexuals,

05:03.200 --> 05:09.859
especially married heterosexuals, do as a matter 
of course. I'll let you do a little speculating on

05:11.088 --> 05:14.731
homosexual rights. What do you think 
legislatively will happen, and what do you think

05:14.951 --> 05:19.876
the courts will do about this? Oh, I think the 
courts will be uniform. Well, the federal courts,

05:21.537 --> 05:27.843
thanks to Reagan, will be hostile for a long, long 
time. Within states, it varies. You know, the only

05:31.746 --> 05:39.593
person really to look into homosexual voting 
strength was Mondale. when he got the Democratic

05:39.961 --> 05:45.253
nomination in 1984. And his people believe that 
there is in this country a core of about 400 million

05:52.567 --> 06:00.765
voters who will define themselves primarily as 
homosexuals and who will vote as a bloc. Now, most

06:00.905 --> 06:12.229
experts, and this is really since the dawn of 
civilization, believe that the incidence of

06:00.905 --> 06:12.229
homosexuality in any society is relatively 
constant, that it's about 10%. People are just

06:15.561 --> 06:16.884
born that way. And if that's true, of course, we 
don't have 4 million homosexuals. We have 25

06:19.931 --> 06:21.655
million. But he was talking about 4 million that 
would vote that way. Now, on a national level, I

06:26.527 --> 06:29.514
mean, that's really significant. If it's 
scattered, since many, many homosexuals still

06:32.830 --> 06:40.717
cannot identify themselves as such, you don't 
have that much voting strength. Now obviously in

06:40.778 --> 06:50.046
places like San Francisco you do, in New York City, 
but even in New York City it took them more than 10

06:40.778 --> 06:50.046
years to get a gay rights ordinance passed. I think 
that's going to be a very slow process. I hope

06:57.233 --> 06:59.175
eventually We're going to be at a place where 
homosexuals will have fully equal rights and will

06:59.813 --> 07:08.946
be able to marry, but that's going to be a slow one. 
Let's talk about your latest paper, or one of your

07:10.597 --> 07:16.844
latest papers, The Limits of Constitutional 
Doctrine in Women's Rights. That is a paper that

07:17.225 --> 07:21.349
has now been submitted for publication. I'm 
waiting to hear about it, and I delivered it at the

07:21.830 --> 07:26.595
Scott Press in Sweden I talked about. And 
basically I was looking at a very interesting

07:27.116 --> 07:37.768
phenomenon, which is that if you look at the cases 
since 1971 when the Supreme Court began Using the

07:37.934 --> 07:57.377
Equal Protection Clause to recognize women's 
rights, you find that the majority of, not the

07:37.934 --> 07:57.377
majority of successful plaintiffs, but the 
majority of plaintiffs and the most recent

07:37.934 --> 07:57.377
plaintiffs have been men, and that the primary 
beneficiaries of these new cases have been men,

07:57.695 --> 08:02.879
not women. And you begin asking yourself, why? And 
I think I came up with something very interesting,

08:05.902 --> 08:11.687
because the way that the court, well, we saw it in 
the Baki case. The court doesn't talk about

08:11.767 --> 08:16.371
oppression, inequality, subjection, 
inferiority. The court talks about

08:16.631 --> 08:18.793
discrimination. Its language is neutral. And 
that language is a lot of help to a man who has to pay

08:21.355 --> 08:27.600
alimony. in a state where only men have to do that. 
But if you have a woman who's trying to make a claim

08:31.674 --> 08:43.425
about divorce, for example, there's no question 
it doesn't relate very well into the terms that are

08:31.674 --> 08:43.425
set by the judges. And I look into the history of 
some of that. It's not that the justices sit down

08:45.988 --> 08:49.771
and say, OK, we're men. How can we develop law for 
men? It's the neutral concepts they have

08:52.053 --> 08:55.917
developed serve the status quo, whether it's 
male, whether it's white, whether it's upper

08:55.897 --> 09:03.177
class or bourgeois, whatever it is. And that 
constitutional language just does not work very

09:04.341 --> 09:11.340
well to satisfy women's aims this is going to be 
probably part of a book that i'm doing on what is

09:11.742 --> 09:35.202
called feminist jurisprudence and that's really 
a growing field in the discipline looking at law

09:11.742 --> 09:35.202
from the point of view not of men

09:11.742 --> 09:35.202
but correct me if i'm wrong there's been probably 
three doctrines used in in this uh constitutional

09:35.840 --> 09:38.866
doctrines used for sexuality cases. What do you 
mean? Up to 71, a certain doctrine was used.

09:44.316 --> 09:46.500
Through the 70s, we had a doctrine, then it 
changed. Oh, well, sort of. Okay, you're talking

09:48.183 --> 09:50.828
about sex discrimination. Up to 71... It was 
basically a blank check. Sex discrimination was

09:54.533 --> 09:57.337
okay if the states wanted to do it. After 1971, they 
kind of, between 71 and 76, they kind of toyed with

09:57.937 --> 10:04.786
it. Well, for a while, you had four justices who 
thought you should treat sex as a suspect by the way

10:04.826 --> 10:13.337
you treat race discrimination. That never got a 
majority of the court. And then in 76, they came out

10:15.580 --> 10:20.646
with the Intermediate Standard in favor of 
scoring. that sex discrimination had to bear a

10:20.626 --> 10:26.673
substantial relationship to an important 
governmental objective. And that's essentially

10:26.953 --> 10:28.956
where we are now. So it wasn't really three 
doctrines. It was two and a half, because they

10:31.339 --> 10:39.629
never actually decided to make sex a subject 
classification. So you said that men are

10:39.649 --> 10:45.115
benefiting right now from the constitutional 
doctrine. How about there are benefits from

10:45.702 --> 10:51.170
cultural reasons like, I mean, the economics, 
etc.? Well, sure. One of the things that I thought

10:52.231 --> 11:03.026
about was, hey, maybe men benefit because men just 
consume more often, go to court more often than

10:52.231 --> 11:03.026
women. Well, there are a few studies of 
litigation. Nobody asked that question. So I

11:08.934 --> 11:12.522
devised a very clumsy and very crude measure. My 
graduate assistant and I just went through the

11:13.004 --> 11:19.840
court cases and the applications for cert and 
counted names. And we left out the criminal cases

11:19.860 --> 11:23.809
because those are going to be all male. We left out 
the corporations because we knew the CEOs would be

11:23.789 --> 11:28.456
nearly all male. And we just looked at cases where 
we could identify a plaintiff and we found they

11:28.917 --> 11:35.648
were all male. The lowest ratio we got was 2 to 1. The 
highest was infinity because there was one set in

11:38.913 --> 11:45.223
which none of the plaintiffs were women. And I 
said, you know, I'm still waiting to see what's

11:45.727 --> 11:56.123
said about this now that I've sent it out for 
review, because this is crude, and I know it's

11:45.727 --> 11:56.123
crude. But it really does look at, okay, when the 
Supreme Court is meeting to decide what it's going

11:56.543 --> 12:08.081
to grant concern on, that most of the cases there 
are bought by males anyway. So, yes, I think there

12:08.101 --> 12:11.025
is an economic reason. A lot of studies have said 
litigation benefits the haves, not the

12:11.005 --> 12:18.811
have-nots. It takes money, it takes time, it takes 
resources to bring a case. You've got to get a

12:23.223 --> 12:24.205
lawyer. Well, most obviously, that means you've 
got to pay a lawyer. Even if through some miracle

12:27.771 --> 12:43.981
you get a lawyer who will take the case on a 
contingency fee basis, which means that he or she

12:27.771 --> 12:43.981
expects to win, if you bring any kind of suit, I 
assure you, you will do a lot of the work yourself.

12:44.622 --> 12:46.125
It takes money and time. In the 50s, the NAACP 
helped out the black movement by organizing and

12:46.797 --> 12:54.381
getting money together and having lawyers to do 
that. What is NOW doing? Now does have a legal

12:55.886 --> 12:59.457
defense in education fund. And they do help out 
some people. Now does not have an awful lot of

13:03.725 --> 13:08.591
money, at least for those purposes. But also 
another, you know, when I talk, when I said that

13:09.312 --> 13:21.867
about claims generally, I was not talking about, 
you know, when I say women bring suits to women, I

13:09.312 --> 13:21.867
was not saying they bring them more often in sex 
discrimination. I was saying they bring them,

13:21.948 --> 13:23.870
period. Right. So only a very small fraction of the 
cases brought before the court have to do with sex

13:24.243 --> 13:29.470
discrimination. And there's a lot of 
disagreement among feminists about, hey, are the

13:29.851 --> 13:36.040
courts the best place to look? Not right now 
they're not. I mean, when somebody has a claim, the

13:38.503 --> 13:44.952
best thing to do is to resolve it. between the two 
parties. The easiest and the cheapest thing is a

13:47.551 --> 13:51.598
conference between two lawyers. But of course 
now, the corporation that's being sued or the

13:52.800 --> 14:00.875
employer, it basically may say to the woman and her 
lawyer, screw you. I'm going to court. I may win.

14:03.199 --> 14:04.341
That's the difficulty. You had an interesting 
sentence in the paper about psychological

14:04.726 --> 14:10.214
reasons that men litigate more. Oh, yeah. Are they 
more... Okay, that's an old joke about...

14:14.220 --> 14:24.394
Bertrand Russell, the philosopher, wrote a 
little thing about how you conjugate irregular

14:14.220 --> 14:24.394
verbs. First person, I am firm. Second person, you 
are obstinate. Third person, He's pig-headed.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.925
Well, you know, maybe men are more assertive than 
women. Who knows? Does that mean they're more

14:39.887 --> 14:42.951
firm, more obstinate, or more pig-headed? Well, I 
leave that to the reader. But, of course, it's also

14:45.495 --> 14:48.639
maybe men are just kicked around more than women. 
But whichever of these are true, we really don't

14:49.300 --> 14:52.805
need to resolve it. Well, let's talk about what 
movement may go. Where does it want to go? What does

14:58.433 --> 14:59.595
it want to do now? Oh, boy. The movement... is not 
monolithic. There is this division basically

15:04.225 --> 15:20.242
between people like Schwartz and Hewlett, the 
ones who want to emphasize accommodating women's

15:04.225 --> 15:20.242
role in the family and those who want to question 
the role in the family. But I think, however, even

15:20.262 --> 15:27.449
guaranteeing that, there are some things that 
everybody's agreed on. I think all feminists,

15:30.451 --> 15:33.075
recognize the need for child care. Whether you're 
a mommy tracker or not, whether you believe that

15:33.996 --> 15:45.073
women have to choose one or the other, you are 
likely to believe that there need to be better

15:33.996 --> 15:45.073
maternity leaves. I mean, the average woman would 
look at six weeks You don't recover physically,

15:48.676 --> 15:57.788
the baby isn't sleeping through the night, you 
haven't established a feeding schedule, you go

15:48.676 --> 15:57.788
back to work and you're exhausted. And you need 
also parenting leaves for both

15:58.849 --> 16:08.161
men and women. Women, whether they're mothers or 
not, whether their family is more important to

16:08.181 --> 16:17.974
them than their job or not, women need an end to 
sexual harassment. They need equal opportunity.

16:20.530 --> 16:24.965
They don't really clearly have it, although we're 
getting toward that. Most feminists are agreed

16:25.668 --> 16:30.765
that the right to choose to continue or terminate 
pregnancy is a necessity. Now, there's a group

16:36.456 --> 16:41.486
that calls itself Feminists for Life, and there 
was an article about them being equal today. I

16:42.267 --> 16:53.209
basically think, I don't think that if you take 
that viewpoint, you can be a feminist, because

16:42.267 --> 16:53.209
those women always end up arguing, well, women 
have a special responsibility towards children.

16:53.189 --> 17:01.920
And I don't think that if you believe that women and 
men are equal, you can believe that women come with

16:53.189 --> 17:01.920
an extra load of responsibilities that men have. I 
don't think that's equality.

17:06.365 --> 17:14.295
Most feminists are united on that issue that 
reproductive choice is a necessity. But that, of

17:14.335 --> 17:20.462
course, is two-sided in European countries. 
mother who has custody of a child gets a subsidy

17:21.590 --> 17:26.758
from the state. We're a long way from having that, 
and I wouldn't say that the movement saw it as a

17:26.778 --> 17:38.295
goal, but it is one way that responsibilities 
toward children could be made easier. There are

17:38.355 --> 17:42.822
lots of ways that we need to aid and help women with 
children. Well, we've kind of established that

17:44.978 --> 17:52.889
the courts aren't going to be one of the methods 
used by the movement so legislatively. Well,

17:53.450 --> 17:55.613
they're not going to be used as much. State courts 
will be.

17:59.839 --> 18:00.740
Who's going to be doing this? Who's going to lead 
this movement? Who's going to be its core? Some

18:05.748 --> 18:06.028
people? New people? I think that you'll begin 
attracting new people. A lot of the people,

18:11.624 --> 18:24.457
certainly one of the leading feminists, Faye 
Waddleton of Planned Parenthood, who was

18:11.624 --> 18:24.457
speaking in Austin the other day, the women 
political officials that are elected are going to

18:11.624 --> 18:24.457
be very important. We have, I think, 27 to 28 
members of Congress. We have three women

18:29.142 --> 18:30.624
governors. Some of us are hoping there'll be four 
pretty soon. There are women judges, especially

18:34.968 --> 18:39.673
in the state courts. it's very hard to know who the 
leaders of the movement are going to be in 20 years

18:41.003 --> 18:47.540
or in 10 years. But there will be people. In fact, 
maybe some feminists would tell you, hey, this

18:49.364 --> 18:55.620
concentration on leaders is a bad thing. Because 
that's really hierarchical. You know, it was

18:59.162 --> 18:59.923
funny. Last night I went to a NOW meeting, and I was a 
little late. And when I walked in, everybody said,

19:03.588 --> 19:10.959
Judy, you've got to write a letter to the Eagle 
about that story about the Ann Richards thing. And

19:10.979 --> 19:12.301
I said, hey, wait a minute. I wrote the last letter. 
but you're so good at it. Hey, come on. You can't

19:17.843 --> 19:22.209
have one or two people grabbing all the publicity. 
Somebody else is going to write the letter. And I

19:24.973 --> 19:32.224
think that basically that's a better style of 
activity than the leadership. I hope that the

19:32.244 --> 19:36.610
women's movement will never have the equivalent 
of a Martin Luther King or a Mark Malcolm X. I mean,

19:36.927 --> 19:44.902
the black movement needed both of those people. Or 
a Jesse Jackson. Well, I don't know. We're

19:48.910 --> 19:51.715
obviously going to have the first woman candidate 
for president. Maybe it'll be Pat Schroeder, who

19:51.755 --> 19:55.723
wrote about it last time. And she's probably going 
to lose, the same way Jackson has. I think that King

19:59.000 --> 20:09.963
and Malcolm were essential to the black movement, 
don't get me wrong, but I am not sure the feminist

19:59.000 --> 20:09.963
movement has the same kind of keys. What are you 
going to do? I'm going to keep on being scholar

20:11.566 --> 20:15.674
first and activist second. I've got plans for this 
world to book on. Women in the Law, which is going to

20:17.697 --> 20:22.746
be an undergraduate text, should be out in the fall 
of 1990. And I'm going to write this feminist shirt

20:23.207 --> 20:25.632
for this thing. And I probably will continue to be 
active in feminist things in Brazos Valley. I

20:31.022 --> 20:34.508
mean, this is the smallest community I've ever 
lived in. And essentially, you know, I'm used to if

20:34.488 --> 20:42.123
you're in Chicago or Los Angeles or Albany, you 
know, there's going to be a demonstration.

20:42.143 --> 20:50.098
There's usually a sign that says, bus will be 
leaving such and such a place at such and such a

20:42.143 --> 20:50.098
time. Call this number to make a reservation. The 
cost is $10. What I have learned is that in Brazos

20:55.548 --> 20:59.835
County, if I don't do it, it doesn't get done. There 
are a few of us, and you know, we had to rent a van and

20:59.855 --> 21:02.959
all this stuff. And basically the nitty-gritty 
stuff has to be done by a few individuals. So

21:08.488 --> 21:17.321
probably I'll continue to be more prominent than I 
was ever before, simply because there are fewer of

21:08.488 --> 21:17.321
us here. Well, what about your textbook? Okay, 
that may be using that, most of it, because there's

21:20.337 --> 21:27.645
only one chapter that needs to be written. As a, you 
know, I'm going to send it to Kinko's and use it for

21:27.665 --> 21:34.172
my Women in the Law course this coming spring. I 
used part of it last time. It's not designed as a

21:36.474 --> 21:38.116
casebook. I have a casebook there. It's really 
designed as a general treatment of the subject of

21:39.358 --> 21:49.028
women in the law, both for students and for a 
general audience. is not original research. It's

21:52.345 --> 22:05.720
the only textbook of its kind so far, and the 
publisher assures me that they already have

21:52.345 --> 22:05.720
advance orders for it. So, of course, I'll 
probably end up revising it every year, but

22:06.701 --> 22:12.568
anyway, that's what happens when you write a text. 
When I was approached with that, I was at Cal Poly,

22:12.548 --> 22:25.187
California State Polytechnic University, 
Pomona, which has a horrendous teaching load, and

22:12.548 --> 22:25.187
I didn't think I would ever get any real research 
done. And I thought, why don't you just do this?

22:27.610 --> 22:30.034
It's the kind of thing you can do. without having to 
devote some really heavy thinking to it, and you

22:30.014 --> 22:37.427
might even get it done. So go ahead, and I did, and 
then I moved here, and I've got a lot more time to do

22:37.447 --> 22:42.857
research. Well, let's talk about A&M a little bit 
then. Okay, this is my second year here. This is a

22:48.688 --> 22:50.571
wonderful department to be in. very diverse, very 
bright, very hardworking, active, productive

22:51.327 --> 22:57.779
people.

23:01.927 --> 23:12.728
One of the things I could improve about the 
university was the law collection of the library,

23:01.927 --> 23:12.728
but it is a good place to work.

23:13.147 --> 23:21.316
The community is a small town, southern 
community, and that's very hard for a New

23:13.147 --> 23:21.316
Englander to live in. It's a long way from 
Cambridge. It's an interesting kind of

23:24.580 --> 23:28.404
adjustment. Does it seem like it's behind the 
times a little bit? Yes.

23:34.691 --> 23:36.673
I'll give an example. I'm on the Women's Studies 
Program Review Committee, and we had a retreat

23:37.227 --> 23:50.120
last spring, and we were talking about the same 
issue, basically, the relational feminism,

23:37.227 --> 23:50.120
mommy track, family issue. And somebody said, one 
of the women faculty in the College of Liberal Arts

23:50.240 --> 23:59.389
said, well, the movement can even include 
lesbians. And I had to bite my tongue. I just wanted

24:00.610 --> 24:05.715
to hear it, and say, the lesbians in Berkeley, 
Cambridge, Madison and Iowa City will really be

24:06.083 --> 24:09.247
very glad. It is just so totally beyond the time. 
That is not an issue.

24:18.197 --> 24:22.142
There's a lag time for things, like the black 
movement. They got legal rights. The movement was

24:24.104 --> 24:28.730
able to get legal rights through the courts, 
through legislation. And then, socially, it

24:29.531 --> 24:34.116
hasn't turned. What about this woman's view? 
There is an extent to which I am a Marxist. I accept

24:42.464 --> 24:48.154
the idea that there are economic classes in 
society, one of which exploits the other. Blacks,

24:49.536 --> 24:53.242
when there are workers, that's when they're 
lucky. Women are workers and wives. are owners,

25:00.421 --> 25:05.927
and I mean owners of means of production, they're 
not any longer owners of good means. Of course

25:07.249 --> 25:16.019
there's going to be a lag between the achievement 
of equal rights and full economic equality. The

25:16.379 --> 25:27.492
reason that most groups need equal rights is that 
they're economically unequal, and the reason

25:16.379 --> 25:27.492
that most groups are economically unequal is 
because they are exploited. The labor of blacks as

25:27.826 --> 25:32.934
slaves, as sharecroppers, as workers is 
exploited. The labor of women as unpaid house

25:33.295 --> 25:43.971
workers, as maids, as secretaries, as nurses, as 
school teachers has been exploited. Now, that's

25:45.454 --> 25:49.019
not true of all disadvantaged groups. The 
disabled are not exploited systematically,

25:49.540 --> 25:56.010
although certainly many of them, you know, You can 
work for Goodwill Industries if you're blind

25:56.243 --> 26:02.732
making light bulbs for 60 cents an hour. I mean, 
come on. But it's not a systematic economic

26:03.493 --> 26:06.737
exploitation. To some extent, the disabled are 
cut out of the exploitation situation at all. So

26:15.669 --> 26:16.951
are Native Americans. I mean, they've been 
encouraged. The tape player messed up. I came back

26:21.422 --> 26:24.847
the next day and continued the interview. We're on 
the same question. I'll let her close up. She's

26:27.551 --> 26:31.416
saying that this is true of the oppressed groups, 
of all oppressed groups. There'll still be a

26:32.257 --> 26:36.382
little bit of a break, but there's about 15 more 
minutes of interview. Many oppressed groups,

26:37.764 --> 26:47.277
that this oppression is economically feasible, 
and that is one reason that it continues. Another

26:48.286 --> 26:57.582
reason is that even when laws change, people do not 
necessarily think of doing anything different

26:48.286 --> 26:57.582
than what they have been doing. Most of the women my 
age, in the 40s and even in the 30s, really believe,

26:58.604 --> 27:11.526
that's age, not decade, of the century, really 
were encouraged to think in terms of such female

27:11.962 --> 27:19.659
occupations as being teachers, social workers, 
librarians. If you were working class, you were

27:20.200 --> 27:23.828
often encouraged to think of yourself as a nurse or 
a secretary. These are all clerical workers.

27:29.022 --> 27:36.398
These are all poorly paid, poorly rewarded, 
traditionally female professions. And to the

27:36.618 --> 27:43.352
extent that women go into those, whether they go 
into them voluntarily or not, they are really

27:43.771 --> 27:49.217
going into exploited jobs and things are not going 
to change very much. This is not only because they

27:49.338 --> 27:59.049
choose them, this is because they never really 
have the opportunity to choose anything else.

27:59.930 --> 28:12.445
Certainly, law cannot immediately change

27:59.930 --> 28:12.445
the behavior either of people who have been 
exploited or the behavior of people who have been

27:59.930 --> 28:12.445
doing the exploiting. Men are going to continue to 
treat women in certain ways, whites to treat

28:14.112 --> 28:19.223
blacks in certain ways, and so on. So it is very hard 
to affect permanent social change, and it's a

28:19.243 --> 28:26.760
long, long struggle to do that. One interesting 
thing, you know, there's a great, great deal of

28:27.401 --> 28:30.889
debate within social science professions as to 
whether blacks are oppressed by racism or that

28:31.223 --> 28:43.787
they are oppressed by factors within their own 
behavior. And the example always given is the

28:43.847 --> 28:46.873
family structure. You know that there are a lot of 
more black women than white women have jobs.

28:53.397 --> 28:57.002
children beginning at age 15 and don't get married 
and so on. It's suggested that the real problem is

28:57.042 --> 29:09.097
not racism, it's that so many people live in this 
way which virtually cuts them out of any kind of

28:57.042 --> 29:09.097
economic advancement. But of course the question 
has to be asked why anyone should be expected to

29:09.157 --> 29:15.625
conform their family structure to the white 
middle class norm. You know, essentially people

29:19.149 --> 29:32.564
may not be so much disadvantaged for being black as 
disadvantaged for a different kind of family

29:19.149 --> 29:32.564
structure, a different kind of choices which seem 
quite natural. And yes, it would be much better if

29:32.624 --> 29:44.498
black teenagers didn't have babies, but on the 
other hand, poverty is not a natural consequence

29:32.624 --> 29:44.498
of having a family which is headed by a young female 
single parent. It is a socially imposed

29:51.632 --> 29:56.201
consequence. I'm going to let you wrap this 
interview up on any point you'd like to make and

29:56.221 --> 30:05.440
just add anything you feel like you'd like to add. 
Actually, I think really this is about it. I got a

30:09.216 --> 30:12.019
lot said that day. I thought that that thing had 
really gone on the blink a lot earlier than it had.

30:18.547 --> 30:19.909
No, you got most of it. I really think there was only 
a minute or two that we didn't get. That's right. So

30:23.613 --> 30:25.776
I think really that's about it. We can wind that up. 
Thank you. Okay, now they're working.

45:49.492 --> 45:50.866
Come on, record something. Let me hear what you got 
to say.
