00:02.528 --> 00:18.383
Following the hearings on the Laredo Transfer 
Bill in the House Higher Education Committee, it

00:02.528 --> 00:18.383
was pretty obvious that the bill was not going 
anywhere as far as the Higher Education Committee

00:02.528 --> 00:18.383
was concerned. However, procedurally, there is a 
way to bypass the committee. Would the Senate

00:27.552 --> 00:32.417
amend a House bill and it be sent back to the House 
for concurrence, then the bill would not be going

00:33.427 --> 00:42.317
through committee. It would have to be a bill that 
would be ruled as germane. So we immediately set

00:48.944 --> 00:57.493
out to determine how many bills there might be that 
were germane or could be ruled germane. to the

00:58.503 --> 01:05.676
subject of transfer of Laredo from A&M system to 
the University of Texas system. One bill in

01:07.279 --> 01:14.352
particular that was germane was legislation that 
would transfer the Baylor College of Dentistry

01:15.800 --> 01:21.168
into the Texas A&M University system. This bill 
was out of committee in the Senate and was

01:22.109 --> 01:35.348
scheduled

01:22.109 --> 01:35.348
for debate on the Senate floor.

01:38.352 --> 01:45.402
Fortunately, the supporters of the Baylor 
College of Dentistry in Dallas became aware of the

01:45.938 --> 01:58.340
problem that could exist should their bill be 
amended and began to lobby to see that it was not

01:45.938 --> 01:58.340
amended. I understand that the Lieutenant 
Governor took the position that the Baylor

01:58.360 --> 02:08.959
College of Dentistry bill would not be amended. 
and later took the position that no amendments to

02:09.563 --> 02:22.002
transfer Laredo would be allowed on any of the 
bills as far as he was personally concerned.

02:25.568 --> 02:37.967
This was fortunate because I think that the 
transfer of Laredo would have been viewed as a

02:25.568 --> 02:37.967
weakness on the part of the Texas A&M University 
system to allow this to happen. and would have

02:38.690 --> 02:43.134
given the NM system a black eye for years to come. We 
gained a position of some strength and the

02:45.176 --> 02:55.946
system was not tarnished. In 1995, during the 
session, I was also asked to work with the new

02:57.808 --> 03:05.355
president of Prairie View to help him become 
introduced and indoctrinated as to the Texas

03:06.078 --> 03:14.591
legislature. I proceeded to introduce him to a 
number of key members of the legislature,

03:14.611 --> 03:28.571
one of which was the local state representative 
from Bryan. The local representative was on the

03:28.591 --> 03:35.882
conference committee of the appropriations bill 
and immediately took an interest in the programs

03:36.503 --> 03:56.371
at Prairie View and asked Dr. Hines to put together 
a proposal on very short notice to provide a summer

03:36.503 --> 03:56.371
intern program for high school students that 
wished to attend Prairie View. They convinced the

03:57.973 --> 04:06.105
president we had very little time to do this and 
that the best way to do it was to do it with our

04:09.545 --> 04:14.811
video telecommunication system hookup between 
Austin and Prairie View. We went to the office,

04:16.192 --> 04:37.476
got on the system, and he was able to work a program 
up with his committee that was back on the campus in

04:16.192 --> 04:37.476
Prairie View, and in a very short time, a matter of 
hours, get a proposal to our local state

04:38.283 --> 04:47.555
representative who was able to get it in the 
appropriations bill. This kind of response is

04:49.518 --> 04:56.067
very important in working with the Texas 
legislature. There's very little time in a

04:57.989 --> 05:05.860
legislative session to respond and react to 
desires and wishes of the legislature. A

05:09.339 --> 05:24.342
particular program and funding was not something 
that the president of Prairie View was asking for,

05:09.339 --> 05:24.342
but it was kind of dropped in his lap, so to speak. 
There are good things that can happen during a

05:26.285 --> 05:31.493
legislative session. if a person is there and is 
alert and understands the process and knows what

05:33.228 --> 05:40.959
he's doing. No substitute, however, for turning 
out good students

05:42.921 --> 06:00.906
that the moms and dads will tell state legislators 
about and

06:02.557 --> 06:11.314
therefore leaving an image of doing your work back 
home, i.e. producing good students. It's to be a

06:13.980 --> 06:17.747
cultivation of all members. so that they will 
discuss issues with you freely and openly and even

06:18.689 --> 06:25.535
seek you out. And this is something that takes a lot 
of time and effort to cultivate the members

06:26.296 --> 06:41.570
because there's a constant rotation of new 
members coming into the legislature each

06:26.296 --> 06:41.570
session. There's been a strong believer in the use 
of our university presidents in addition to the

06:48.136 --> 06:53.121
people that work at the system level. These CEOs 
know their programs better than anyone and can

06:54.042 --> 07:03.651
present them to members of the legislature. It 
should be a coordinated effort in that the system

07:04.873 --> 07:15.443
officials should be kept notified of what is going 
on. There are conflicts between our system

07:16.958 --> 07:46.813
agencies and a system university, particularly 
Texas A&M University, but in each case these can be

07:16.958 --> 07:46.813
worked out and avoided if the interested parties 
are willing to work toward a compromise and let the

07:16.958 --> 07:46.813
system officials handle the issue. The image of 
Texas A&M University affects all components of

07:47.975 --> 07:57.409
the system and for many years has been looked upon 
as the system. Therefore, it's important that

07:58.370 --> 08:13.172
Texas A&M University's image be one of very 
highest regard as it reflects on everyone else.

08:15.346 --> 08:25.518
On January 31, 1996, I

08:15.346 --> 08:25.518
retired from my position as director of public 
policy. And 30 days later, accepted a part-time

08:27.880 --> 08:40.695
position with an agreement to perform a number of 
tasks

08:42.262 --> 08:50.510
with regards to working with the legislators and 
maintaining the TAMIS Life program. The tasks

08:52.572 --> 09:01.340
that were originally agreed to were later 
rejected by my supervisor. And so for the past two

09:02.901 --> 09:08.927
years,

09:02.901 --> 09:08.927
time has been spent for whatever task might be 
asked to perform. In the meantime, I have found

09:17.055 --> 09:23.323
time to compile these memoirs. Otherwise, it 
probably would not have been possible.

09:30.813 --> 09:36.541
1996 was a red-letter year in another way. The 
early 1980s several members of my family, myself,

09:41.948 --> 09:59.651
and some friends chartered the Commerce National 
Bank in College Station

09:41.948 --> 09:59.651
and had been operating as a small independent bank 
since. In 1996,

10:01.794 --> 10:09.103
we were contacted by

10:10.315 --> 10:25.970
the Compass Bank Organization, headquartered in 
Birmingham, Alabama,

10:10.315 --> 10:25.970
and began negotiations with regards to a stock 
exchange merger. Compass is a publicly held stock

10:27.631 --> 10:39.462
company that has branches in Alabama, Florida, 
and the eastern part of Texas. The

10:41.230 --> 11:01.264
merger was finally consummated in April of 1997

10:41.230 --> 11:01.264
for some delays in the approval process that one 
must go through with the Securities and Exchange

10:41.230 --> 11:01.264
Commission. The 1997 session the legislature saw 
me staying in College Station and monitoring the

11:02.172 --> 11:19.053
session

11:02.172 --> 11:19.053
over the internet.

11:19.073 --> 11:30.407
The 1997 session was highlighted by the 
appropriations process going back to its

11:33.442 --> 11:37.848
old ways of being written in conference 
committee. No new dollars were added until the

11:40.011 --> 11:44.117
bill got to the conference committee. New 
formulas were adopted in the Senate for higher

11:46.020 --> 12:00.681
education and finally approved in the conference 
committee, so very little was known about what was

11:46.020 --> 12:00.681
in the appropriations bill until it was finally 
written. an old axiom that the more open

12:02.872 --> 12:09.038
government becomes, the more closed it will be. In 
1990, I'm sorry, 1979, we had been operating under

12:11.039 --> 12:32.018
a very open process in the conference committee, 
but we found a way to make the system work in

12:11.039 --> 12:32.018
conference committee when there needed to be some 
private discussions.

12:38.127 --> 12:48.204
I would meet with the Senate conferees in my 
office, and this did not constitute a quorum since

12:38.127 --> 12:48.204
I was only a member of one. From time to time, I would 
invite another member colleague in the house on

12:54.104 --> 13:15.268
the conference committee into the meeting always 
holding it no more than two of us so that there was

12:54.104 --> 13:15.268
never a quorum this was legal and we were able to 
conduct the business that needed to be conducted

12:54.104 --> 13:15.268
time a new legal approach was found for 1997 by 
delaying all decisions until the conference

13:16.413 --> 13:22.980
committee met. I seriously doubt that I could have 
gotten away, so to speak, with such a procedure in

13:24.462 --> 13:37.997
the time that I served as chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee. I'm sure that we would

13:38.057 --> 13:42.302
have had an uprising and rebellion in the House But 
times do change and legislators have become more

13:43.109 --> 13:50.223
tolerant. Some latitude needs to be provided to 
legislature to meet in private sessions to

13:51.786 --> 14:01.945
consult on certain issues. Under the present 
system, even salaries of key employees must be set

14:04.085 --> 14:14.624
in open session and discussed in such a setting.

14:17.629 --> 14:28.489
In this environment, very little discussion 
takes place, and this is not in the best interest of

14:17.629 --> 14:28.489
good government. The old saying that there are two 
things you don't want to watch, that is your

14:29.785 --> 14:55.405
sausage and your laws being made, was never truer 
than watching the appropriations process and how

14:29.785 --> 14:55.405
funds are allocated through the appropriations 
bill. This is the end of the very last tape.
