WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:03.969
Kruger and all. I will, Marshall Robinette? Oh, 
yeah. In fact, they were in a special class. The

00:14.279 --> 00:18.763
ones that were taking science were in a special 
algebra class. And that I happened to be in, I

00:20.024 --> 00:32.535
shouldn't have been in it really, but after laying 
out of school two years, when I looked at that

00:20.024 --> 00:32.535
second the year algebra that I was supposed to be 
going into, I discovered I didn't have a clue. So I

00:40.271 --> 00:47.200
dropped English and took first year algebra. And 
later on to my ultimate disgrace, the next summer I

00:48.562 --> 00:57.593
took a correspondence course in English from the 
University of Texas. So I had three credit hours

00:57.613 --> 01:00.497
that I made. Because you know how easy the UT 
courses are. So you have at least some lame

01:05.581 --> 01:09.144
Longhorn background. I had three hours at the 
University of Texas. But I was in this housing

01:14.409 --> 01:25.940
class, and we had a, I can't think of his name, an 
instructor that was absolutely outstanding. He

01:25.960 --> 01:28.162
could make anybody see it. And we had a bunch of 
these football players. in there that were taking

01:32.050 --> 01:34.554
science. And I was in that class and it was, after 
getting oriented a couple weeks, it was really a

01:35.155 --> 01:55.324
brutish thing for me because I'd taken two years 
out of high school and as a coach, so I had a lot of fun

01:35.155 --> 01:55.324
helping these guys through that course. Let's 
see, help me with nicknames for various food items

01:56.198 --> 02:01.605
in the dining hall. Kush, butter, milk, tea.

02:12.580 --> 02:13.000
Ketchup. That's blood.

02:22.608 --> 02:36.724
Milk

02:22.608 --> 02:36.724
was cow, wasn't it? Yeah.

02:41.610 --> 02:42.551
Bread was veal?

02:48.057 --> 02:48.157
Yeah. I'll think of some of those and go along. All 
right. Try to recall and share with me some of the

02:51.397 --> 03:01.747
pranks, the jokes, the good bull that you knew 
about, whether you were involved or not, that you

02:51.397 --> 03:01.747
knew. Well, I think I can tell you the ultimate 
practical joke. Great. That was put on the campus

03:07.612 --> 03:10.355
when I was in my senior year. The Baltimore women in 
training. I think it was a junior. I got a hold of one

03:17.281 --> 03:19.463
of the... makeup on this that

03:20.101 --> 03:37.598
you'd see in some of the movies, like Frankenstein 
and that type of stuff. Big teeth hanging out,

03:37.618 --> 03:45.967
grotesque eyes, the whole thing was a real trouble 
mask. And he was holding one of the infantry

03:49.717 --> 03:57.248
company. This is where the, uh, the infantry real 
body. And he said, Lester, he said, boy, this guy

04:04.559 --> 04:09.066
can scare the wits out of anybody, anybody. And, 
uh, uh, he said, uh, if you, he said, you know, you

04:09.086 --> 04:15.456
haven't passed Keeley up to any of that, that, that 
engineers. He said, I'll, I'll get him to come over

04:15.476 --> 04:16.638
there. He said, I'd like to come along myself. Uh, 
and If after everybody's asleep, if you let him in

04:18.539 --> 04:29.615
the room on the day, you'll have more fun. So I went 
to let his young break and this guy came over and I

04:29.635 --> 04:34.863
mean, he was something else. And he could fix it 
when he's sober. And he had a gate that says,

04:43.666 --> 04:48.472
trouble and he'd wash the clothes even worse, you 
know. And it looked like he was a maniac, which he

04:48.492 --> 04:52.197
actually did. And so I'd go in, let him in. His 
walk-in room would snap on blank, you see. And

05:02.130 --> 05:10.461
sometimes I'd wait for him to get in that room, and 
sometimes I wouldn't, you see. But if not, he'd go

05:10.481 --> 05:12.964
and shake the bed, you see. And there he'd be. He'd 
wake up and look into his face

05:14.699 --> 05:27.174
and you'd just think most of them would bolt past 
him and down the hall. Didn't even notice us

05:27.996 --> 05:32.001
laughing there in the hall and get out of the 
dormitory. They had one friend named Phil Potts.

05:35.926 --> 05:41.753
Phil was a good steward and a senior didn't have to 
turn the lights off. So Phil was doing some work he

05:42.256 --> 05:44.799
studied. So finally, I turned to meet on Phil while 
he was at his desk. He went over and kind of leaned

05:50.386 --> 05:51.928
over. Phil looked at me, and I went, wow, we walked 
in behind that. And I guarantee you, Phil had

05:57.014 --> 06:00.438
goosebumps on his leg. Had a little part of the 
eighth of an inch high, and some little goosebumps

06:00.899 --> 06:06.846
on top of those. And he bolted. He covered, he was on 
the third stoop and he was down on the ground floor

06:09.055 --> 06:14.880
so fast you couldn't even believe it. But we did 
this for two, three hours. I've never

06:20.866 --> 06:24.389
participated in a practical joke in such effect. 
And no harm done to anybody. Nobody did good,

06:26.391 --> 06:28.173
nobody. It's funny, I thought, and he had only two 
occasions somebody attacked him. Just got to

06:35.058 --> 06:39.043
fight and just go after them. But all these guys, 
all they wanted was running room. Get out of there.

06:43.889 --> 06:50.016
Did you and your buddies as fish ever play any jokes 
on a sophomore? Can you think of any retaliation? A

06:53.360 --> 06:55.203
little sabotage. Primarily things like short 
shooting and stuff like that. So we'd make it

06:59.248 --> 07:00.810
there. And of course, you'd... You never short 
sheet by who you were making

07:04.960 --> 07:13.008
them. But you could short sheet

07:13.028 --> 07:18.953
somebody. I'll mislead things for them, hide 
things for them. Did y'all ever do any drown outs of

07:22.997 --> 07:25.780
sophomores?

07:29.023 --> 07:31.305
Toward the end of the year, we tried that. That got 
us in a big bunch of trouble. Then we had, at the end

07:34.289 --> 07:54.812
of the year, we had a big beer, traditionally 
they'd come in these years, and a big beer bust at a

07:34.289 --> 07:54.812
little lake, actually a pond that was all maybe 
four or five feet deep and muddy and all. And we'd

07:59.461 --> 08:09.535
get in there and I'd try to see if we could drown the 
sophomores. This went on until my senior year,

08:10.536 --> 08:22.673
Colonel Watson, agreed that there

08:10.536 --> 08:22.673
wouldn't be any of those things occur. uh,

08:23.108 --> 08:50.206
uh, E Company, uh, which was commanded by, uh, 
Charlie McDonnell, uh, McDaniels, who was a real

08:23.108 --> 08:50.206
good friend of mine since, since deceased, uh, had 
a feast day. And uh, Colonel Watson was just

08:50.226 --> 08:51.407
absolutely out of his mind. He was just really with 
it. And

08:52.319 --> 09:09.518
he called everybody in, including

08:52.319 --> 09:09.518
me. And if anybody's connected with this, I'm 
going to break them. So we were all supposed to be

09:14.123 --> 09:17.147
able to connect ranks and have a chance to go in 
service. And so the order. for no fish

09:18.155 --> 09:27.532
steaks, you

09:18.155 --> 09:27.532
see. Instead of being rooted, to me, as regimental 
commander, I was only posted in

09:27.552 --> 09:40.054
the company commander's office, and I never did a 
company. So I'm reminded, Colonel Watson, that if

09:40.074 --> 09:42.458
you, and neither did the battalion commanders. 
that if he was

09:43.383 --> 10:04.397
dealing directly with these company commanders,

09:43.383 --> 10:04.397
that he'd put us out of the chain of command. Well, 
that made him get mad at him. But, so I had developed

10:05.138 --> 10:08.884
a friendship with the dean of engineering, and 
we'd get real close to him. So

10:09.185 --> 10:33.608
I hustled off to talk to Gabriel Preston about the 
situation. I said, you know, the colonel just

10:33.628 --> 10:34.849
needs somebody to talk to. He said he's about to 
bust about half the engineer officers. And I don't

10:36.090 --> 10:37.251
know how to give him that, but he got it done. And

10:37.703 --> 11:00.767
I know that at this big meeting, the dining room, he 
took his capitol board home and threw it on the

10:37.703 --> 11:00.767
floor. And everybody else got off that roof except 
for me. I think finally it made that Charlie had to

11:01.828 --> 11:02.749
do

11:06.070 --> 11:08.755
Now this beer bust, where was that? Where was it 
physically? Where was it? West of the tracks?

11:13.042 --> 11:15.266
Somewhere off of Highway 6, east of the campus. 
Northeast of the campus. Southeast of the campus,

11:17.890 --> 11:21.697
yes. And this was day or night? This was daytime. 
Day, okay. And so your outfit would be there? Yeah.

11:29.931 --> 11:30.913
I participated in the when I was a freshman or 
sophomore. The juniors and seniors didn't care

11:34.334 --> 11:35.516
for that. No dates. Now after that, then the 
freshmen took the stripes off and they were human

11:36.898 --> 11:42.968
beings again. Now this was primarily beer, was 
there food? Yeah, some food. Nobody else except

11:50.240 --> 11:51.702
the outfit? No girls, no parents? There might be 
some juniors and seniors kind of observing. Would

11:59.058 --> 12:04.424
there be other outfits having parties at 
different places, different times? Yeah. It was a

12:04.565 --> 12:07.568
pretty common thing to have a fish day. Do you 
remember any other pranks played on sophomores or

12:07.588 --> 12:14.196
seniors?

12:16.659 --> 12:19.462
Nothing as good as what I told you. Stealing 
somebody's footlocker, was that a... Oh, yeah.

12:24.408 --> 12:26.210
The whole gamut of hiding things. Where would you 
hide them? It wasn't really a whole lot of places to

12:28.724 --> 12:32.249
hide them. You'd usually hide them in somebody 
else's room. You might, for instance, if I wanted

12:36.194 --> 12:53.536
to steal a sophomore's shoes, you know, to get in 
with the problem, I might hide them under the bed of

12:36.194 --> 12:53.536
the senior whose newborn was taken care of.

12:53.776 --> 12:55.018
Did you all play hall hockey?

12:58.154 --> 13:11.646
That I know in the 60s they would play it with the 
ball in the hallway and you would kick it through

12:58.154 --> 13:11.646
the door at the end of the hallway and it was kind of 
like kickball. No, that must have been a new

13:11.846 --> 13:14.969
generation. Tell me about the bull ring. Where was 
it? What was it? Well, four infractions primarily

13:18.873 --> 13:26.980
involved with the military discipline. or

13:27.854 --> 13:53.084
other

13:27.854 --> 13:53.084
things, you were

13:27.854 --> 13:53.084
given a penalty which involved walking, that we 
had to do it and walk it off in the bullring. And an

13:53.104 --> 13:57.169
hour on the bullring, it was certainly a deal that 
had somebody watching and we'd walk the bullring

13:53.104 --> 13:57.169
to get these penalties off. When did you do that? 
Was there a specific time? A lot of times it was

14:00.323 --> 14:02.245
Saturday afternoon. In uniform? In uniform. In 
full uniform. Where was it? One

14:07.972 --> 14:19.647
of them

14:07.972 --> 14:19.647
was very close to where Abbelled Hall is. just off 
that edge. There's another one over I think near,

14:23.631 --> 14:34.847
right at the place where Keene

14:23.631 --> 14:34.847
is. But after my freshman year, I managed to figure 
out a way not to be on the program. What do you think

14:42.879 --> 14:47.305
the men in your outfit thought about you as a 
sophomore? What kind of a sophomore were you?

14:54.888 --> 15:03.158
I was, I probably had a high ranking with freshmen 
and sophomores, because I was still a basketball

14:54.888 --> 15:03.158
player. And so I didn't have time to harass them as 
much as others. And also, having been out of school

15:09.145 --> 15:15.132
for two years, I was a little bit more mature than 
the other sophomores. And it sort of arrived at the

15:20.340 --> 15:28.088
conclusion that some of this was a bunch of 
bullshit, so to speak. So I didn't harass the

15:28.529 --> 15:32.032
freshmen here as badly as the other sophomores. I 
was more popular with the freshmen than some of the

15:32.773 --> 15:35.816
other sophomores. However, the juniors and 
seniors ruled me pretty hard for not being tough

15:36.357 --> 15:44.325
enough on the freshmen. What were the incentives 
for you to succeed at A&M? The depression, family?

15:50.724 --> 15:51.945
Tell me about those.

15:54.868 --> 16:07.420
Well, my primary incentive, I suppose, was the 
fact that my parents expected all of their

15:54.868 --> 16:07.420
children to do well. And I often think that a lot of 
the parents are really, in these days, really

16:15.068 --> 16:33.419
messing up there

16:15.068 --> 16:33.419
by not having higher expectations for the 
children. My mother particularly had high

16:33.439 --> 16:40.011
expectations for us and we ended up, all three of 
us, I think I ended up with six in one place. And we

16:40.031 --> 16:40.772
were just expected to do well. And I think that over 
most everything else. All right. And you and your

16:46.657 --> 16:50.441
brothers are first-generation college 
students. Did either of your parents go to

16:50.481 --> 16:51.883
college? No. And you went to high school at 
Hallettsville? Yes. How many in your senior

16:56.389 --> 16:57.650
class? 32 of them. It wasn't a great thing to be in 
the class of 32. Do you remember anything about the

17:04.899 --> 17:12.328
retention rate in your freshman, sophomore 
years? Well, when the grades came out, the first

17:13.068 --> 17:24.281
grades came out,

17:13.068 --> 17:24.281
I think it was about the third, third of the 
freshman year. About how many would graduate in

17:24.301 --> 17:27.725
your outfit?

17:30.549 --> 17:32.992
I'd say less than half. Yeah, less than half. 
Important question. Who were some of the

17:37.577 --> 17:40.881
memorable teachers counselors, advisors, staff 
members. Tell me about as many of those as you can.

17:48.197 --> 17:53.904
Well, Dr. Wolfram

17:48.197 --> 17:53.904
was great. I thought he did a good job, 
particularly working

17:53.924 --> 18:04.998
with the student

17:53.924 --> 18:04.998
leaders. Mr. Crawford was outstanding.

18:13.582 --> 18:20.712
What

18:13.582 --> 18:20.712
did he do?

18:20.732 --> 18:29.485
He taught

18:20.732 --> 18:29.485
mechanics. Chemistry? Chemistry. Physics? I'm 
just trying to think about it. We had an

18:36.055 --> 18:38.138
outstanding lecture on chemistry. I didn't get

18:39.620 --> 18:46.368
down to Stanford. Well, I enjoyed physics, but I 
didn't get down to Stanford. English, math?

18:52.995 --> 18:53.816
I'm afraid I've forgotten most of them. Were there 
some characters that you remember? I can't

18:56.739 --> 19:09.053
remember either character. Describe

19:09.893 --> 19:16.823
him, please.

19:21.871 --> 19:25.135
Why was he Satch? I think it's because of carrying 
that satchel. Describe Dr. Walton, President

19:32.406 --> 19:37.774
Walton's personality and Well,

19:39.745 --> 19:47.897
he really had an easy going personality.

19:47.917 --> 19:58.472
You could say that he could get into a crowd and fit 
in anywhere he wanted to and the students liked

19:47.917 --> 19:58.472
T.O. Hawkins. Gilchrist, describe him please. 
Gilchrist was a little scientist. There again, he

20:09.327 --> 20:19.823
was a very well liked

20:09.327 --> 20:19.823
person.

20:19.963 --> 20:23.349
And he really stood in behind his engineers. And 
just like

20:23.369 --> 20:30.820
I was telling you, he was Colonel Watson. He 
managed to get that thing straightened out

20:30.840 --> 20:37.731
without all the darn things that Colonel Watson 
brought. In the Corps, were there some memorable

20:38.437 --> 20:42.401
Corps officials? We mostly knew the people that 
were there, like Colonel

20:44.382 --> 20:53.831
Adcock was head of the engineers, and I thought he 
did a good job. But later on, after he went to

20:53.851 --> 21:07.043
Lucian's and returned to train a rather easier 
maintenance company, Colonel Adcock found out I

20:53.851 --> 21:07.043
was in the States. got what we assigned as 
Engineering Reckoning. First thing you do is go

21:11.890 --> 21:15.014
back overseas and you're studying. Instead of 
saving the engineer maintenance company, but at

21:15.034 --> 21:23.144
that time we were very anxious to do this. I'm 
reciting this, you know, we were graduating

21:23.164 --> 21:26.028
early. Not too early, but a few, two, three weeks 
early. And all of the engineers went to San Houston

21:36.622 --> 21:48.039
Fort Salem used to move and

21:36.622 --> 21:48.039
there wasn't a single one that wanted not to get his 
commission. I remember very well, there was a

21:48.059 --> 21:55.710
classmate, E.E. Bird, he called E-Square.

22:00.638 --> 22:02.340
And I was appellate and he was E.E. Bird's, so we 
were next each other. They

22:05.326 --> 22:29.259
took, it was the very third physical examination, 
including a whole chest x-ray. And I was called in

22:29.279 --> 22:30.360
and told that I had physical pain. And I had 
evidence of having had some damage. Of course. Of

22:33.845 --> 22:54.113
course,

22:33.845 --> 22:54.113
I was

22:33.845 --> 22:54.113
begging robots to do it. I said, well, I had no 
mystery of this. I don't think it's that bad. I

22:55.515 --> 22:56.276
don't say I could possibly be right. And so one of 
the medical officers there took a look at my

22:56.296 --> 22:57.638
denture. He said, this isn't as big as I am. He said, 
his chest is 50% bigger than this. And it turned out

22:59.261 --> 22:59.961
it was E squared. And he busted out. And I mean, it 
was absolutely devastating. It wasn't like in . We

23:05.070 --> 23:09.156
did not want to be busted out. Now, this is the 
spring of 41. What was your nickname? They all call

23:14.424 --> 23:15.225
me this. Just last? You didn't have any?

23:20.373 --> 23:22.456
Let's go to classroom behavior. Oh, OK.

23:27.220 --> 23:31.724
What were the expectations of class? How did you 
all behave in class? Did you go to class regularly?

23:36.308 --> 23:37.129
Did you stay awake? We behaved fairly well.

23:44.415 --> 23:53.103
I think

23:44.415 --> 23:53.103
that was part of the effect of the military school. 
They were disciplined. The professors insisted.

23:57.427 --> 24:00.951
Was the roll checked?

24:03.814 --> 24:04.034
Absolutely. And grades went home. Did y'all even 
compute grade point ratios? Y'all didn't talk

24:13.043 --> 24:15.225
about GPA, did you?

24:23.694 --> 24:23.794
Yeah. OK. Now, you came? planning to major in 
engineering and you stayed with engineering the

24:26.519 --> 24:47.937
whole way

24:26.519 --> 24:47.937
looking back what were the most important courses 
that you took and why

24:53.249 --> 25:15.049
A

24:53.249 --> 25:15.049
mechanics course,

24:53.249 --> 25:15.049
physics

24:53.249 --> 25:15.049
courses. Of course, the English is really a high 
rating, but other than the English for economics,

25:15.069 --> 25:19.113
it all started very well. And the little writing 
and public speaking we had. Had

25:20.806 --> 25:45.409
you done slide rule in high school? So that began. 
Was there a cut? I still have the slide rule right

25:50.741 --> 25:53.765
down here. I don't know where it was. Where was the, 
who taught you how to use the slide rule? That was

26:00.914 --> 26:02.436
the portion, yeah. OK. And typical engineer 
freshmen took that. And how did you transport the

26:07.022 --> 26:12.589
slide rule from one place to another? Where did 
you? In the case, we hung it on the belt. And all the,

26:14.692 --> 26:18.977
you can tell engineers that way, all the 
engineers. All

26:19.278 --> 26:32.863
right, among

26:19.278 --> 26:32.863
you engineers, engineering was the prime major. 
Was there any major on the campus that y'all looked

26:33.323 --> 26:41.438
down on, made fun of, teased about?

26:44.320 --> 26:48.764
There were so few in it that they invested in 
liberal arts. We didn't have a liberal arts group.

26:51.167 --> 26:53.209
I don't think we even had a liberal arts college. So 
that almost everybody was either in ag. Or

26:56.292 --> 26:57.073
engineering. What was the most, did any 
particular field of engineering have the largest

26:57.093 --> 27:02.698
enrollment? Was there one that was most popular? 
Probably civil and mechanical. And we had

27:10.686 --> 27:12.268
electrical, chemical. Let's

27:14.037 --> 27:29.518
talk about the library. Did you all call it Cushing 
or just Cushing Library or just the library? And

27:37.289 --> 27:43.437
was it possible to go over there and find a corner to 
snooze and to sleep in? You can try it, but it's the

27:44.007 --> 27:52.379
sophomore who regularly leaves the library. And 
did you all... Since I had a face strike on freshman

27:54.943 --> 28:09.465
year, we've had sophomores from one of the 
infantry companies, I'll tell you a couple of

27:54.943 --> 28:09.465
them, he'd

27:54.943 --> 28:09.465
come to sleep and then he'd report it to my 
sophomore. And that's, that's bad. Typically, a

28:10.206 --> 28:12.529
network of The sophomore

28:13.454 --> 28:20.041
was working in the mess hall. And they had a mess 
hall. They

28:22.684 --> 28:39.022
had punished him by taking a knife, taking a 
flat-feathered knife and hitting it real rapidly

28:22.684 --> 28:39.022
in the palm of your hand. And it just really started 
smarting. Did

28:43.863 --> 28:52.892
that have a name doing that?

28:55.935 --> 28:57.297
See, I haven't heard that one before. Would that 
happen when you got caught? Right then?

29:06.346 --> 29:07.367
Back to the library. How much time did you spend in 
the library? Very little. Very little research.

29:14.727 --> 29:19.452
And your academic load per semester was normally 
what? Eighteen. And you graduated in what? Four

29:23.957 --> 29:26.079
years. I wouldn't have thought of anything else, 
my gosh. You spend money to do an extra semester.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.107
Here's the thought. All right, the YMCA. What role 
did it play in the campus? Well, we had the other

29:40.494 --> 29:43.637
practitioners. a

29:44.090 --> 29:53.222
Lutheran group for me Sunday evening on the second 
floor of the YMCA. And so were lots of other groups.

29:58.089 --> 30:00.993
Describe, let's go back, you said your Lutheran 
group. Mention what that was. Well, just a group

30:03.436 --> 30:12.628
of Lutheran affiliated students. Were there 
similar groups for other denominations? Who was

30:17.153 --> 30:18.815
the key leader? Was there an advisor? There was, I 
think, one of the local pastors. Okay. Who headed

30:27.566 --> 30:29.329
the YMCA then? Was it Mr. Cashin? Yeah, it was. Red 
Cashin's dad? Yeah, his dad, that's right. Sure

30:36.438 --> 30:39.202
was. And let's see, what else happened in the YD? 
Well, that was a place where if someone was going

30:43.709 --> 30:56.743
to come to the campus, you might tell them that you 
would meet them at the Y. But it was a central

30:56.763 --> 30:57.464
meeting place. And there was, you see the drill 
field was just dying across from the Y. And there

31:04.732 --> 31:08.856
was a, at that time there was a silver moon for 
Campbell's Park in the room. driveways and so

31:09.038 --> 31:11.903
forth. There weren't that many cars. This was my

31:16.151 --> 31:23.745
senior year. We had one

31:23.765 --> 31:29.035
car. It was an old Model A Ford Roadster with a 
rubber seat.
