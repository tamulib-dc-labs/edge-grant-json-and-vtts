WEBVTT

00:06.860 --> 00:07.661
I will, uh. Marshall Robinette? Oh yeah, in fact 
they were in a special, I shouldn't have been

00:11.883 --> 01:04.420
injured, after laying out of school two years, I 
dropped English and the next

00:11.883 --> 01:04.420
summer

00:11.883 --> 01:04.420
I took a correspondence

00:11.883 --> 01:04.420
course, so I had three credit hours that I made, but 
you know how easy the UT courses are. So you have at

01:04.400 --> 01:09.046
least some Lang Longhorn background. I had three 
hours of university

01:09.146 --> 01:14.613
time. I was in this housing school class, and I 
can't think of his name I wish that anybody

01:15.794 --> 01:28.910
would see him. They had a bunch of these football 
players

01:28.890 --> 01:55.940
in there that were taking science, and I was in that 
class and it was after a bloody cinch for me,

01:28.890 --> 01:55.940
because two years I was going to high school as a 
coach, so I had a lot of fun helping these guys.

01:55.920 --> 02:01.404
Let's see, help me with nicknames for various food 
items in the dining hall. Kush, butter, milk, tea,

02:01.624 --> 02:12.992
ketchup.

02:35.569 --> 02:36.950
Milk was cow, wasn't it? Yeah,

02:36.930 --> 02:40.995
yeah. Bread, bread was deal.

02:51.808 --> 03:02.140
Try to recall and share with me some of the pranks, 
the jokes, the good bull that you knew about,

02:51.808 --> 03:02.140
whether you were involved or not, that you knew. 
Well, I think I can tell you that. Okay. One of the

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
guys, the old thing, the real

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
type

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
of mask,

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
he was holding

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
one of the infantry companies

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
where the regimental

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
cannon for the infantry. He said, last week, he 
said, boy, this guy keeps scaring the wits out of

03:54.550 --> 04:02.060
anybody, anybody. He said, if you, he said, if you 
ever pass Keeley up leading, I'll get

04:02.040 --> 04:31.420
him to come over and play as a sleeper, but if you'll 
have him in,

04:02.040 --> 04:31.420
that is great. And this guy came over, and I mean, he 
was something. He was something else. He'd, he'd

04:34.400 --> 04:36.500
fix it when he's sloppy.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.501
And there he'd be. He'd wake up and looking into 
this face. I mean, it was, it was, it was, it was, it

04:43.120 --> 05:25.460
was, it was, it was, it was,

04:43.120 --> 05:25.460
it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, 
it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it

04:43.120 --> 05:25.460
was, it was, it was. I mean, that's the thing, 
that's the thing. at the door, he's laughing. I

05:29.440 --> 06:01.750
mean, this guy, he's, you know,

05:29.440 --> 06:01.750
I didn't even know

05:29.440 --> 06:01.750
what

05:29.440 --> 06:01.750
he was doing. there. And I'm going, oh, he hit the 
bench high. And some little goose bumps on top of

06:04.730 --> 06:07.280
those. And he bolted. He was on the third stoop, and 
he, he was down on the ground floor. So fast you can

06:14.470 --> 06:16.700
never believe it. But, we, we did this for 2, 3 
hours. participated

06:21.080 --> 06:47.260
and no harm done to anybody did

06:21.080 --> 06:47.260
you and your buddies as fish ever do any play any 
jokes on a sophomore can you think of any

06:47.240 --> 07:23.320
retaliation don't ever

07:23.300 --> 07:40.100
do it any drown outs of sophomores

08:54.230 --> 09:04.780
that

08:54.230 --> 09:04.780
anybody's connected with

08:54.230 --> 09:04.780
this we

09:04.760 --> 09:19.190
have a chance to

09:04.760 --> 09:19.190
go in service with no fish sticks instead of being 
rude to me as regimental

09:19.170 --> 09:40.450
commander I only posted him to remind him

09:19.170 --> 09:40.450
and neither did the battalion that

09:40.430 --> 09:56.340
if he was dealing directly with these company 
commanders well that made him get madder

09:56.320 --> 09:58.340
so I had developed a friendship you

09:58.320 --> 10:16.540
know I also love to talk to this situation the

10:16.520 --> 10:22.160
colonel just needs somebody to talk to him he said 
he's about to bust about half the I

10:26.140 --> 10:38.120
don't know how I

10:26.140 --> 10:38.120
give him that but and I know that at this big meeting 
like

10:40.100 --> 10:46.910
90 group capitol board on 314 everybody

10:48.890 --> 10:56.390
else got off that really good except for me I think 
finally they made it now

10:59.370 --> 11:08.060
this beer bust where was that where was it 
physically where was it west of the track

11:13.040 --> 11:15.060
somewhere off of highway six east of the campus 
northeast of the campus southeast of the campus

11:22.040 --> 11:24.060
and this was day or night it was in the daytime and so 
your outfit would be there no dates

11:28.040 --> 11:43.670
now after that

11:43.650 --> 11:45.670
now this was primarily beer was there food nobody 
else except the outfit no girls no parents would

11:53.110 --> 12:02.700
there be other outfits having parties at 
different places different times do

12:02.680 --> 12:20.800
you remember any other pranks played on 
sophomores or seniors or stealing somebody's

12:02.680 --> 12:20.800
footlocker was that a where

12:20.780 --> 12:27.050
would you hide them did you all

12:27.030 --> 12:54.160
play

12:27.030 --> 12:54.160
hall hockey

12:54.140 --> 13:02.700
that

12:54.140 --> 13:02.700
I know in the sixties they would play it with the 
ball in the locker room with the ball in the hallway

13:06.680 --> 13:08.700
and you would kick it through the door at the end of 
the hallway and it was kind of like like kickball no

13:10.680 --> 13:14.580
that's where what tell me about the bull ring where 
was it what was it you walked the bull ring four

13:20.640 --> 13:57.210
infractions

13:20.640 --> 13:57.210
somebody

13:20.640 --> 13:57.210
watching

13:57.190 --> 14:00.210
when did you do that was there a specific time a lot 
of times it was Saturday afternoon in uniform in

14:02.190 --> 14:05.520
uniform where was it after

14:06.500 --> 14:37.900
my

14:06.500 --> 14:37.900
freshman year I managed to figure out a way not to be 
on the bull ring what do you think the men in your

14:44.820 --> 14:47.840
outfit thought about you as a sophomore what kind 
of a sophomore were you I

14:51.840 --> 15:01.320
probably had a high rank because I was still a 
basketball player I had time to rest and also

15:08.790 --> 15:45.050
having

15:08.790 --> 15:45.050
been a solid

15:08.790 --> 15:45.050
rider

15:08.790 --> 15:45.050
to lose

15:45.030 --> 15:49.050
what were the incentives for you to succeed at A&M 
the depression family what tell me about those I

15:52.030 --> 16:45.790
think

15:52.030 --> 16:45.790
those

15:52.030 --> 16:45.790
were

15:52.030 --> 16:45.790
seven

15:52.030 --> 16:45.790
things alright and you and your brothers are first 
generation college students did either of your

16:49.770 --> 16:51.790
parents go to college and you went to high school at 
Hollisville how many in your senior class do

16:57.180 --> 17:08.460
you

16:57.180 --> 17:08.460
remember anything about the retention rate in 
your freshman sophomore years about how many

17:11.660 --> 17:27.820
would graduate in your outfit important

17:27.800 --> 17:37.820
question who were some of the men who were some of 
the memorable teachers counselors advisors

17:43.800 --> 17:48.420
staff members tell me about as many of those as you 
can well Dr.

17:48.400 --> 18:16.680
Walter

18:16.660 --> 18:29.870
what did

18:16.660 --> 18:29.870
he do chemistry

18:29.850 --> 18:34.360
physics I was just trying to think about we had

18:35.490 --> 18:47.160
an outstanding

18:35.490 --> 18:47.160
lecture English math

18:53.200 --> 18:54.221
I think I forgot most of them were there some 
characters that you remember I don't

18:57.200 --> 19:08.880
remember I had a character describe

19:08.860 --> 19:15.980
him please describe him please he was a foolish 
subject he could bring it to you why was he satch I

19:25.520 --> 19:29.130
think it was because carrying that satchel 
describe

19:30.110 --> 19:34.390
Dr. Walton President

19:34.370 --> 19:59.600
Walton

19:34.370 --> 19:59.600
personality

19:59.580 --> 20:31.340
Gilchrist describe him please

20:31.320 --> 20:34.340
that thing straightened out without all the all 
the dire things that there was in the core were

20:39.440 --> 20:44.460
there some memorable core officials we were some 
good

20:44.440 --> 20:53.070
job later

20:53.050 --> 20:57.240
on after went to Lucian's and returned to another 
engineering maintenance company in

21:02.880 --> 21:07.100
the states got what we assigned as engineering 
recognition first thing you do at the back of the

21:09.270 --> 21:13.340
season instead of instead of training 
engineering maintenance company but at that time

21:17.320 --> 21:18.341
we we were very anxious to do this I'm very excited 
to do this you know we we were graduating early not

21:26.320 --> 21:28.840
too early but a few two or three weeks early and all 
of the engineers went to Sam Houston Fort Sam went

21:35.820 --> 21:43.100
to Sam Houston there wasn't a single one that 
wanted not to get his commission I'm very

21:49.360 --> 22:09.220
fascinated

21:49.360 --> 22:09.220
with

21:49.360 --> 22:09.220
E-Square physical examination including I

22:12.200 --> 22:21.380
was

22:12.200 --> 22:21.380
called in and

22:21.360 --> 22:40.870
I said possibly and so one of the medical

22:45.000 --> 22:52.190
officers said his chest is fifty percent bigger 
than this and it turned out it was E-Square he was

22:56.990 --> 23:03.870
absolutely devastated it wasn't like in the war we 
did not want to be busted out now this is the spring

23:08.850 --> 23:10.870
of 41 what was your nickname just last you didn't 
have any let's go to let's go to classroom behavior

23:21.740 --> 23:23.760
oh okay what

23:23.740 --> 23:29.150
kind what were the expectations of class how did 
y'all behave in class did you go to class regularly

23:33.130 --> 23:34.151
did you stay awake very rude behavior roles was the 
role checked and grades

23:39.720 --> 24:01.020
went home did

24:01.000 --> 24:04.810
y'all did y'all even compute grade point ratios 
did y'all y'all didn't talk about GPA did you now

24:11.790 --> 24:13.810
are you came

24:13.790 --> 24:24.180
to the you came planning to major in engineering 
and you stayed with engineering the

24:32.250 --> 24:37.810
whole way all right looking back what were the most 
important courses that you took and

24:42.790 --> 25:44.000
why

24:42.790 --> 25:44.000
had

24:42.790 --> 25:44.000
you done slide rule in high school so that began was 
there a where

25:50.860 --> 25:58.150
where was the who taught you how to use the slide

26:00.130 --> 26:05.110
rule typical engineer freshman took that and how 
did you transport the slide rule from one place to

26:11.530 --> 26:12.551
another where did you all

26:13.530 --> 26:27.930
right

26:13.530 --> 26:27.930
among

26:13.530 --> 26:27.930
you engineers engineering was the the prime major 
was there any major on the campus that y'all looked

26:34.910 --> 26:36.930
down on made fun of teased about so

26:37.910 --> 26:53.650
that almost

26:37.910 --> 26:53.650
everybody was either an ag what was the most do you 
did any particular field of engineering have the

27:01.160 --> 27:03.180
largest enrollment was there one that was most 
popular uh

27:04.160 --> 27:28.700
let's talk about the library did y'all call it 
Cushing or did you just Cushing library or just the

27:35.440 --> 27:37.550
library uh and was it possible to go over there and 
find a corner to

27:42.530 --> 27:52.060
snooze and to sleep in and did y'all mm

27:53.040 --> 28:38.510
see

28:38.490 --> 28:39.511
and it just it just really started so

28:41.490 --> 28:51.380
did

28:41.490 --> 28:51.380
that have a name doing that well they called it a 
name see I haven't heard that one before but would

28:58.340 --> 29:01.310
that happen when you got caught right then right 
then right back to the library uh how by how much

29:08.890 --> 29:09.911
time did you spend in the library uh and your 
academic load per semester was normally what and

29:19.050 --> 29:22.380
you graduated in what four years uh we wouldn't 
have thought of that you spend the money to go to

29:34.300 --> 29:35.321
next time so right the YMCA uh describe

29:59.150 --> 30:00.171
let's go back you said your Lutheran group mention 
mention

30:03.150 --> 30:13.260
what what that was just were there were there 
similar groups for other who was the key leader was

30:21.240 --> 30:28.140
there an advisor or who who headed the YMCA then was 
it Mr. Cashion

30:34.760 --> 30:40.350
yeah Red Cashion's dad yeah and well that was a 
place where

31:17.590 --> 31:19.610
uh we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we
