WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:09.146
Marshall Robinette?

00:09.166 --> 00:09.666
Oh yeah.

00:09.686 --> 00:13.811
In fact, they were in a special class.

00:14.251 --> 00:22.300
The ones that were taking science were in a special algebra class that I happened to be in.

00:23.180 --> 00:32.350
I shouldn't have been in it really, but after laying out of school two years, when I looked at that second

00:33.022 --> 00:46.221
year algebra that I was supposed to be going into, I discovered I didn't have a clue.

00:46.241 --> 00:48.925
So I dropped English and took the first year algebra.

00:48.945 --> 00:57.578
And later on to my ultimate disgrace, I took, next time I took a correspondence course in English from New York to Texas.

00:57.598 --> 01:00.582
So I had three credit hours that I made

01:01.523 --> 01:05.166
You know how easy the UT courses are.

01:05.567 --> 01:09.110
So you have at least some Lang Longhorn background.

01:09.130 --> 01:12.953
I have three hours from the University of Texas.

01:14.375 --> 01:25.925
But I was in this algebra class and we had a, I can't think of his name, I wish I could, an instructor that was absolutely outstanding.

01:25.945 --> 01:28.147
He could make anybody see it.

01:28.668 --> 01:31.210
And we had a bunch of these football players.

01:31.628 --> 01:34.553
in there that were taking science.

01:35.134 --> 01:55.206
And I was in that class and it was, after getting oriented a couple of weeks, it was really a bloody cinch for me because I've taken two years of algebra in high school and as a coach, so I had a lot of fun helping these guys through that course.

01:56.182 --> 02:01.389
Let's help me with nicknames for various food items in the dining hall.

02:01.609 --> 02:06.095
Cush, butter, milk, tea.

02:12.564 --> 02:12.985
Ketchup.

02:13.946 --> 02:23.319
That's blood.

02:23.419 --> 02:23.539
Cedar.

02:24.498 --> 02:35.490
I see bullets or wings, I think.

02:35.510 --> 02:36.691
Milk was cow, wasn't it?

02:36.931 --> 02:41.516
Yeah, yeah.

02:41.576 --> 02:42.537
Bread was deal?

02:47.983 --> 02:48.083
Yeah.

02:48.103 --> 02:50.225
I'll think of some of those and that'll go along.

02:50.626 --> 02:50.826
All right.

02:51.380 --> 03:02.154
Try to recall and share with me some of the pranks, the jokes, the good bull that you knew about, whether you were involved or not, that you knew.

03:02.174 --> 03:12.247
Well, I think I can tell you the ultimate practical joke that was put on campus during my senior year.

03:13.089 --> 03:16.854
I think he was a junior.

03:16.934 --> 03:19.497
I got ahold of one of the

03:20.101 --> 03:37.200
make about this that you'd see in some of the movies like Frankenstein and that type of stuff.

03:37.220 --> 03:48.572
Big teeth hanging out, grotesque eyes, the whole thing with a real clever mask.

03:48.592 --> 03:49.213
And he was holding one of the

03:49.700 --> 04:14.297
And he said, boy, this guy keeps scaring the woods out of anybody, anybody.

04:14.317 --> 04:16.260
And he said, if you, he said, you have a past kid ever leaving that young doctor, that engineers.

04:16.280 --> 04:17.102
He said, I'll get him to come over there.

04:17.122 --> 04:18.103
He said, I'd like to come along with that.

04:18.505 --> 04:30.766
if after everybody's asleep there, if you let him in the room, I guarantee you, you'll have more fun.

04:30.786 --> 04:32.929
So I went for that.

04:32.949 --> 04:33.390
It sounded great.

04:33.410 --> 04:39.400
And this guy came over, and I mean, he was something else.

04:39.420 --> 04:40.362
And he could fix it when he slumped.

04:41.253 --> 04:49.443
And he had a gate that says, trouble in any worse clothes, it's even worse, you know.

04:49.744 --> 05:01.198
And he looked like he was a maniac, but he actually did.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.980
And so I'd go in, let him in, walk in the room and snap on the line, you see.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.009
And sometimes I'd wake up in that room, but sometimes I wouldn't, you see.

05:10.029 --> 05:10.770
But if not, he'd go over to

05:11.122 --> 05:12.004
and shake the lid.

05:12.024 --> 05:14.148
And there he'd be.

05:14.649 --> 05:17.074
He'd wake up and look into his face.

05:20.762 --> 05:25.832
And you'd just think, most of them would bolt.

05:25.852 --> 05:27.696
Pass him down off.

05:27.862 --> 05:31.928
Didn't even notice us laughingly in the hole and get out of the doctor.

05:32.849 --> 05:35.332
They had one friend named Phil Potts.

05:35.873 --> 05:38.216
Phil was a good student.

05:38.236 --> 05:41.681
And seniors didn't have to turn their lights off, see.

05:42.482 --> 05:44.765
So Phil was doing some work he studied.

05:44.785 --> 05:49.111
So finally I turned him in on Phil while he was at his desk.

05:50.593 --> 05:54.078
Even though it was kind of lean though, Phil looked at him.

05:54.138 --> 05:55.540
We walked in behind that.

05:55.874 --> 06:04.927
I guarantee you, Phil had goosebumps on his leg that were about an eighth inch high and some little goosebumps on top of those.

06:07.271 --> 06:08.032
And he bolted.

06:08.072 --> 06:15.503
He covered, he was on the third stoop and he was down on the ground floor so fast you couldn't ever believe it.

06:16.613 --> 06:20.799
But we did this for two, three hours.

06:20.819 --> 06:24.363
I've never participated in a practical joke in such a fact.

06:24.383 --> 06:25.925
And no harm done to anybody.

06:26.546 --> 06:27.087
Nobody's good.

06:27.127 --> 06:28.148
Nobody.

06:28.168 --> 06:36.319
It's funny, I thought, and he had on one or two occasions somebody attacked him, you see.

06:36.339 --> 06:39.463
Just got frightened, just go after him, you see.

06:39.483 --> 06:43.148
But all these guys, all they wanted was running home.

06:43.168 --> 06:43.869
Get out of there.

06:43.889 --> 06:46.232
Did you and your buddies as fish...

06:46.735 --> 06:49.978
ever do any, play any jokes on a sophomore?

06:51.099 --> 06:52.660
Can you think of any retaliation?

06:53.321 --> 06:55.903
A little sabotage.

06:55.923 --> 07:00.327
Primarily things like short sheeting and stuff like that, so we make them.

07:00.787 --> 07:12.998
And of course, you never short sheet by who you were making them.

07:13.018 --> 07:16.641
But you could short sheet somebody.

07:17.397 --> 07:22.946
Don't mislead things for them, hiding things for them.

07:22.966 --> 07:25.770
Did y'all ever do any drown outs of sophomores?

07:28.995 --> 07:31.279
Towards the end of the year, we tried that.

07:31.579 --> 07:34.403
That got us in big trouble.

07:34.423 --> 07:39.912
Then we had, at the end of the year, we had a big beer.

07:40.448 --> 07:58.210
Traditionally then, they'd come in these years and a big bare bust and a little lake.

08:00.233 --> 08:04.879
Actually, a pond that was all maybe four or five feet deep and muddy.

08:04.899 --> 08:09.865
And we'd get in there and I'd try to see if we could drive a soft horse.

08:10.435 --> 08:34.156
This went on until my senior year, Colonel Watson, agreed that there wouldn't be any of those things on Earth.

08:34.176 --> 08:40.341
So, the E-Company was just commanded by Charlie McDonald, McDaniels, who was a real good friend, deceased, had a fish day.

08:41.873 --> 09:04.378
And Colonel Watson was just absolutely out of his mind.

09:04.398 --> 09:05.039
He was just really with it.

09:05.059 --> 09:05.920
He called everybody in, including me.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.141
And if anybody's connected with us, I'm going to break them.

09:07.161 --> 09:08.202
So we were all supposed to be together and together.

09:08.468 --> 09:17.149
ranks and had a chance to go in service.

09:17.169 --> 09:26.190
And so the order for no fish days, you see, instead of being rude to me as regimental commander,

09:27.571 --> 09:47.820
was only posted in the company commander's box, and I never put a company.

09:47.840 --> 09:53.448
So, I reminded Colonel Watson that if he, and neither did the staff, the battalion commanders, that if he was dealing directly with these company commanders, that he put us out of the chain of command.

09:53.468 --> 09:54.169
Well, that made him get mad at him.

09:56.090 --> 10:17.084
So I had developed a friendship with the Dean of Engineering, who was Gabriel Preston.

10:17.104 --> 10:18.486
And so I hustled off to talk to Gabriel Preston about that situation.

10:18.922 --> 10:40.527
And the colonel just needs somebody to talk to him.

10:40.547 --> 10:41.809
He said he's about to bust about half the engineer's office.

10:41.829 --> 10:42.990
And I don't know how to give him that, but he got it done.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.592
And I know that at this big meeting, McDaddy group, he come and come out there.

10:45.027 --> 10:57.913
took his capitol court on the floor.

10:57.933 --> 11:03.565
And everybody else got off that really good, except for the name.

11:03.585 --> 11:05.128
I think, finally, it remained that Charlie had to do a little blowering walk.

11:06.037 --> 11:09.804
Now this beer bust, where was that little, where was it?

11:10.425 --> 11:12.067
Physically, where was it?

11:12.087 --> 11:12.989
West of the tracks?

11:13.009 --> 11:14.231
Somewhere off of Highway 6.

11:14.952 --> 11:17.537
East of the campus.

11:17.557 --> 11:19.721
Northeast of the campus.

11:19.801 --> 11:20.843
Southeast campus.

11:21.704 --> 11:23.948
And this was day or night?

11:24.589 --> 11:25.170
It was in that time.

11:25.190 --> 11:25.731
Day, okay.

11:25.891 --> 11:27.614
And so your outfit would be there?

11:29.037 --> 11:29.237
Yeah.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.880
I participated in

11:31.332 --> 11:34.295
Well, those were not a freshman, sophomore.

11:34.315 --> 11:35.676
The juniors and seniors didn't care for that.

11:35.696 --> 11:36.257
No dates.

11:36.878 --> 11:43.564
Now after that, then the freshmen took the stripes off and they were human beings again.

11:43.584 --> 11:45.927
Now this was primarily beer.

11:45.987 --> 11:46.667
Was there food?

11:47.328 --> 11:48.229
Yeah, some food.

11:48.369 --> 11:50.191
Okay.

11:50.211 --> 11:51.673
Nobody else except the outfit.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.374
No girls, no parents.

11:53.474 --> 11:55.857
Just the year there.

11:55.877 --> 11:58.099
There might be some juniors and seniors kind of observant.

11:59.024 --> 12:04.290
Would there be other outfits having parties at different places at different times?

12:04.310 --> 12:04.531
Yeah, yeah.

12:04.551 --> 12:07.134
It was a pretty common thing to have a fish day.

12:07.474 --> 12:08.655
Alright.

12:08.675 --> 12:14.182
Do you remember any other pranks played on sophomores or seniors?

12:16.645 --> 12:19.448
Nothing as good as what I told you.

12:19.468 --> 12:20.870
Stealing from somebody's footlocker?

12:21.050 --> 12:21.631
Oh yeah.

12:21.651 --> 12:26.837
The whole gamut of hiding things.

12:26.877 --> 12:27.698
Where would you hide them?

12:28.690 --> 12:32.234
There wasn't really a lot of places to hide them.

12:32.254 --> 12:36.139
You'd usually hide them in somebody else's room.

12:36.159 --> 12:53.500
You might, if I wanted to steal a sophomore's shoes, you know, to give him a problem, I might hide them under the bed of the senior whose room I was taking care of.

12:53.781 --> 12:55.002
Did you all play hall hockey?

12:58.087 --> 12:59.989
I don't recall.

13:00.009 --> 13:11.621
All right, that I know in the 60s, they would play it with a ball in the hallway and you would kick it through the door at the end of the hallway and it was kind of like kickball.

13:11.841 --> 13:14.924
No, that must have been a new generation.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.366
Tell me about the bull ring.

13:16.486 --> 13:17.067
Where was it?

13:17.147 --> 13:17.747
What was it?

13:18.849 --> 13:26.997
Well, four infractions, primarily involved with the military discipline.

13:27.803 --> 13:52.499
or other things, you were given a penalty which involved walking, that we had to walk it off in the bullring.

13:52.519 --> 13:54.402
And an hour on the bullring was in the circle of ill and had somebody watching and you walked.

13:54.905 --> 13:58.749
When did you do that?

13:58.929 --> 14:00.370
Was there a specific time?

14:00.631 --> 14:03.353
A lot of times on Saturday afternoon.

14:03.373 --> 14:04.014
In uniform?

14:05.015 --> 14:06.096
In uniform.

14:06.276 --> 14:08.058
Where was it?

14:10.541 --> 14:22.292
One of them was very close to where Appell Hall was.

14:22.312 --> 14:23.534
Just off that edge.

14:23.554 --> 14:24.895
There was another one over there.

14:25.364 --> 14:34.013
I think in here, right at the place with Keene's office.

14:34.033 --> 14:42.821
But after my freshman year, I managed to figure out a way not to be on the building.

14:42.841 --> 14:50.349
What do you think the men in your outfit thought about you as a sophomore?

14:50.369 --> 14:51.810
What kind of a sophomore were you?

14:54.727 --> 15:04.460
I probably had a high ranking with freshmen and sophomores, because I was still a basketball player.

15:04.480 --> 15:09.087
And so I didn't have time to wrestle as much as the other.

15:09.107 --> 15:20.903
And also, having been out of school for two years, I was a little bit more mature than the other sophomores.

15:21.355 --> 15:27.886
And it sort of arrived into losing to some of this was a bunch of bulls, so to speak.

15:27.906 --> 15:30.570
And so I didn't harass the freshman years badly.

15:31.011 --> 15:36.319
I suppose I was more popular with the freshmen than some of the other sophomores.

15:36.339 --> 15:44.292
However, the juniors and seniors ruled me pretty hard for not being tough enough on the freshmen.

15:45.065 --> 15:48.669
What were the incentives for you to succeed at A&M?

15:49.070 --> 15:51.913
The depression, family, tell me about those.

15:54.877 --> 16:07.432
Well, my primary incentive, I suppose, was the fact that my parents expected all of their children to do well.

16:07.452 --> 16:14.481
And I often think that a lot of the parents are really, in these days,

16:15.068 --> 16:35.804
really messing up there by not having higher expectations for the children.

16:35.824 --> 16:37.967
My mother particularly had high expectations for us and we ended up, all three of us, from Dalvin Corridor.

16:37.987 --> 16:39.109
I think I ended up sixth in one place.

16:39.129 --> 16:40.772
And we were just expected to do well.

16:42.929 --> 16:45.693
And I think that was almost everything else.

16:45.713 --> 16:45.933
All right.

16:46.233 --> 16:50.419
And you and your brothers are first-generation college students.

16:50.459 --> 16:51.901
Did either of your parents go to college?

16:51.921 --> 16:53.283
No.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.446
And you went to high school at Hallisville?

16:56.267 --> 16:56.347
Yes.

16:56.367 --> 16:57.608
How many in your senior class?

16:58.129 --> 17:00.512
Thirty-two.

17:00.933 --> 17:04.217
That wasn't a great thing to be in the class of thirty-two.

17:04.878 --> 17:12.328
Do you remember anything about the retention rate in your freshman, sophomore years?

17:13.034 --> 17:23.090
Well, when the grades came out, the first grades came out, I think we lose about a third, a third of the freshman.

17:24.271 --> 17:27.697
About how many would graduate in your outfit?

17:30.521 --> 17:32.985
I'd say less than half.

17:33.005 --> 17:35.188
Yeah, less than half.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.532
Important question.

17:37.552 --> 17:40.797
Who were some of the memorable teachers,

17:41.418 --> 17:44.401
Counselors, advisors, staff members.

17:45.102 --> 17:46.784
Tell me about as many of those as you can.

17:48.166 --> 17:54.373
Well, Dr. Wolfram was president.

17:54.393 --> 18:05.025
I thought he did a good job, particularly working with the student leaders at the time of junior and senior year.

18:05.045 --> 18:10.952
Mr. Crawford, who had been the guy in California here, was outstanding.

18:15.539 --> 18:17.282
What did he do?

18:19.125 --> 18:29.464
He taught the mechanics and engineering.

18:29.484 --> 18:32.049
Chemistry?

18:32.069 --> 18:32.750
Chemistry.

18:33.652 --> 18:34.132
Physics?

18:34.152 --> 18:35.355
He was trying to think about it.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.340
We had an outstanding lecture on chemistry.

18:39.586 --> 18:47.196
Physics, I didn't get that standard.

18:47.216 --> 18:53.484
I enjoyed physics, but I didn't get that standard.

18:53.504 --> 18:54.245
English, math?

18:54.265 --> 18:56.689
Were there some characters that you remember?

18:56.709 --> 19:09.205
I can't remember either character.

19:09.775 --> 19:15.564
that taught the economics, Satch Elkinson.

19:15.744 --> 19:17.447
Describe him, please.

19:17.467 --> 19:20.731
He was a full subject.

19:20.751 --> 19:23.295
He could bring it to you hard and fast.

19:24.076 --> 19:25.118
Why was he Satch?

19:26.019 --> 19:27.261
I don't know why they called him Satch.

19:27.622 --> 19:30.346
I think it was because of carrying that satchel.

19:30.366 --> 19:33.070
Could be, but I don't remember.

19:33.230 --> 19:37.757
Describe President Walton's personality

19:39.712 --> 19:45.719
Well, he really had an easy going personality.

19:45.739 --> 19:55.311
You could say that he could get into a crowd and fit in anywhere he wanted to.

19:55.331 --> 19:58.475
And the students liked Tealwater.

19:59.836 --> 20:03.821
Alright, Gilchrist, describe him please.

20:03.841 --> 20:08.807
Gilchrist, of course, was a scientist.

20:09.277 --> 20:21.828
And there again, he was a very well-liked person.

20:21.848 --> 20:29.455
And he really stood him behind his engineers.

20:30.436 --> 20:37.562
And just like I was telling you, Mr. Carlson, he managed to get that thing straightened out without all the darn things that Carlson Roberts has happened.

20:38.420 --> 20:42.385
In the Corps, were there some memorable Corps officials?

20:44.347 --> 20:51.696
We mostly knew the people that were there.

20:51.716 --> 20:57.984
Like, Colonel Adcock was head of the engineers and I thought we did a good job.

20:58.004 --> 21:06.975
Later on, after we went to Aleutians and returned to train a rather easier maintenance company, Colonel Adcock found that out in the States.

21:07.664 --> 21:13.712
got what we assigned as engineering recommend.

21:13.732 --> 21:23.686
First thing we do is back overseas instead of, instead of say the engineer maintenance company, but at that time we were very anxious to do this.

21:23.706 --> 21:24.967
I'm excited against it.

21:24.987 --> 21:26.009
You know, we were graduated early.

21:28.372 --> 21:30.675
Not too early, but a few, two or three weeks early.

21:32.397 --> 21:35.882
And all of the engineers went to Sam Houston.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.626
Fort Sam.

21:39.006 --> 21:48.037
And there wasn't a single one that wanted not to get his commission.

21:48.057 --> 21:55.987
I remember very well, there was a classmate, E.E.

21:56.007 --> 21:59.291
Bird, we called E-square.

22:00.693 --> 22:02.495
And I was appellate, he was E.E.

22:02.515 --> 22:04.317
Bird, so we were next to each other.

22:05.258 --> 22:28.490
They took, it was the very third physical examination, including a whole chest x-ray.

22:28.510 --> 22:29.711
And I was called in and told him that I had evidence of him.

22:29.731 --> 22:30.152
He had some coverage.

22:33.845 --> 22:52.989
Of course, I was begging for a wash.

22:53.009 --> 22:54.891
And I said, well, I had no mystery of this.

22:54.911 --> 22:55.552
I don't think this is the doubt.

22:55.572 --> 22:56.193
I don't say I'm possibly right.

22:56.213 --> 22:57.394
And so one of the medical officers there took a look at it.

22:57.414 --> 22:58.255
He said, this isn't this boy that I bring.

22:58.275 --> 22:59.217
He said, his chest is 30% bigger than this boy.

22:59.237 --> 22:59.917
And it turned out it was E square.

22:59.938 --> 23:00.358
And he requested out.

23:00.710 --> 23:03.853
And I mean, he was absolutely devastating.

23:03.873 --> 23:06.215
He wasn't like in the 50-meter war.

23:07.096 --> 23:08.498
We did not want to.

23:08.518 --> 23:09.138
He busted out.

23:09.158 --> 23:10.440
Now this is the spring of 41?

23:12.341 --> 23:13.202
What was your nickname?

23:14.403 --> 23:15.184
They all call me this.

23:15.845 --> 23:16.465
Just last?

23:16.485 --> 23:20.089
You didn't have any?

23:20.409 --> 23:22.451
Let's go to classroom behavior.

23:23.252 --> 23:28.097
Oh, okay.

23:28.397 --> 23:30.379
What were the expectations...

23:31.017 --> 23:33.600
Of class, how did y'all behave in class?

23:35.142 --> 23:36.243
Did you go to class regularly?

23:36.263 --> 23:39.507
Did you stay awake?

23:39.547 --> 23:42.851
We behaved very well.

23:44.774 --> 23:59.091
I think that was part of the fact that the military students were disciplined.

23:59.111 --> 23:59.952
The professors insisted on that.

24:00.112 --> 24:00.973
Was the role checked?

24:03.620 --> 24:06.703
And grades went home.

24:07.684 --> 24:11.789
Did y'all even compute grade point ratios?

24:13.010 --> 24:15.192
Y'all didn't talk about GPA, did you?

24:18.456 --> 24:23.942
Okay.

24:24.582 --> 24:32.631
Now, you came planning to major in engineering, and you stayed with engineering the whole way.

24:32.915 --> 25:01.656
All right, looking back, what were the most important courses that you took and why?

25:02.615 --> 25:25.449
The engineers here really dilated with the English, the economics, you know, serving very well.

25:25.469 --> 25:27.191
The little writing in public, speaking in the hand, we certainly could use more of it.

25:27.211 --> 25:27.812
But we were very well trained.

25:28.805 --> 25:57.175
had you done slide rule in high school so that began was there a cut where where was the

25:58.302 --> 26:00.304
Who taught you how to use the slide rule?

26:00.705 --> 26:02.286
That was of course, yeah.

26:02.306 --> 26:02.406
Okay.

26:03.848 --> 26:06.951
And typical engineer freshman took that?

26:06.971 --> 26:07.071
Yeah.

26:08.453 --> 26:12.557
And how did you transport the slide rule from one place to another?

26:12.577 --> 26:13.097
Where did you?

26:13.278 --> 26:14.739
In the case and hung it on the belt.

26:16.121 --> 26:18.063
And all the engineers, you could tell the engineers everywhere.

26:18.243 --> 26:21.827
All the engineers walking on campus, they had the slide rule.

26:21.847 --> 26:23.088
It wouldn't be taught.

26:23.108 --> 26:25.170
They just wouldn't be caught without the slide rule going on.

26:26.332 --> 26:32.819
All right, among you engineers, engineering was the prime major.

26:33.280 --> 26:38.506
Was there any major on the campus that you all looked down on, made fun of, teased about?

26:44.592 --> 26:55.765
So that almost everybody was either in ag

26:57.010 --> 27:02.617
What was the most, did any particular field of engineering have the largest enrollment?

27:02.678 --> 27:04.340
Was there one that was most popular?

27:05.401 --> 27:15.615
Probably silver and mechanical.

27:15.635 --> 27:16.276
And we had electrical, chemical.

27:16.296 --> 27:18.539
At that time, I don't think we had aeronautical.

27:18.559 --> 27:19.240
Oh, I bet not.

27:19.640 --> 27:20.061
I bet not.

27:22.965 --> 27:25.448
It ought to be silver, mechanical, electrical.

27:26.778 --> 27:29.461
Let's talk about the library.

27:31.223 --> 27:35.847
Did y'all call it Cushing or just Cushing Library or just the library?

27:37.249 --> 27:43.095
And was it possible to go over there and find a corner to snooze it to sleep in?

27:46.238 --> 27:51.584
You can try it, but it's a sophomore from the regular cruise library.

27:51.604 --> 27:55.468
And did y'all... I had a face stripe on it.

27:55.904 --> 28:25.017
And they had a mess off if you messed up the sophomores.

28:25.790 --> 28:38.870
that punish you by taking a knife, taking a flat feet of the knife and hitting it real rapidly in the palm of your hand.

28:38.890 --> 28:45.940
And it just really started smarting, you know, and raising a little wealth across there.

28:48.324 --> 28:50.267
That was discipline inside the missile.

28:50.507 --> 28:52.911
Did that have a name doing that?

28:54.595 --> 28:57.940
See, I haven't heard that one before.

28:59.862 --> 29:02.426
Would that happen when you got caught?

29:02.726 --> 29:03.247
Right then?

29:03.468 --> 29:03.828
Right then.

29:06.312 --> 29:07.353
Back to the library.

29:08.034 --> 29:11.759
About how much time did you spend in the library?

29:12.801 --> 29:13.662
Very little.

29:15.545 --> 29:19.450
And your academic load per semester was normally what?

29:21.693 --> 29:22.915
And you graduated in

29:23.232 --> 29:23.913
What?

29:23.933 --> 29:24.473
Four years.

29:26.035 --> 29:27.736
We wouldn't have thought of anything else, my gosh.

29:28.077 --> 29:31.580
You spend the money to do an extra semester.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.063
Here's the thought.

29:34.083 --> 29:35.484
All right, the YMCA.

29:35.985 --> 29:39.528
What role did it play in the campus?

29:39.548 --> 29:45.254
Well, we had the other practitioners who stepped to the YMCA.

29:48.157 --> 29:49.678
Alufin group.

29:50.182 --> 29:58.610
Sunday evening and so were lots of other groups.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.130
Let's go back.

29:59.170 --> 30:00.251
You said your Lutheran group.

30:00.772 --> 30:03.374
Mention what that was.

30:03.394 --> 30:13.543
Well, it was just a group of Lutheran affiliated students.

30:13.944 --> 30:15.665
Were there similar groups for other?

30:15.905 --> 30:16.206
Yes.

30:17.147 --> 30:18.788
Who was the key leader?

30:19.477 --> 30:20.779
Was there an advisor?

30:21.740 --> 30:27.067
There was, I think, one of the local pastors.

30:27.528 --> 30:29.311
Who headed the YMCA then?

30:30.853 --> 30:32.094
Was it Mr. Cashin?

30:32.695 --> 30:33.276
Yeah, it was.

30:33.296 --> 30:34.277
Red Cashin's dad?

30:34.678 --> 30:36.380
Yeah, his dad, that's right.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.183
Sure was.

30:39.184 --> 30:42.108
And, let's see, what else happened in the wide?

30:43.750 --> 30:49.298
Well, that was a place where if someone was going to come to the campus,

30:49.565 --> 31:03.884
you might tell them that you would meet them at the Y. But it was a central meeting place.

31:03.904 --> 31:11.494
And there was, you see, the drill field was just dying across from the Y. And there was a, at that time, a silver roof of Campbell's Park and the one with the driveways and so forth.

31:11.514 --> 31:12.315
And there weren't that many cars.

31:12.700 --> 31:23.945
For instance, in my senior year, we had one car in that town.

31:28.816 --> 31:31.722
It was an old Model A Ford roadster with a rumble seat.
