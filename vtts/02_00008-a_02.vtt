WEBVTT

00:06.860 --> 00:07.661
I will, uh. Marshall Robinette? Oh yeah, in fact 
they were in a special, I shouldn't have been

00:11.883 --> 01:04.420
injured, after laying out of school two years,

00:11.883 --> 01:04.420
dropped English and the next

00:11.883 --> 01:04.420
summer

00:11.883 --> 01:04.420
took a correspondence

00:11.883 --> 01:04.420
course, so I had three credit hours that I made, but 
you know how easy the UT courses are. So you have at

01:04.400 --> 01:09.046
least some Lang Longhorn background. I had three 
hours in university

01:09.146 --> 01:14.613
time. I was in this housing school class, and I 
can't think of his name I wish that anybody

01:15.794 --> 01:28.910
would see him. They had a bunch of these football 
players in there that were taking science, and I

01:28.890 --> 01:55.940
was in that class,

01:28.890 --> 01:55.940
and it was after a bloody cinch for me, because two 
years I was going to high school as a coach, so I had a

01:28.890 --> 01:55.940
lot of fun helping these guys.

01:55.920 --> 02:01.404
Let's see, help me with nicknames for various food 
items in the dining hall. Cush, butter, milk, tea,

02:01.624 --> 02:12.992
ketchup.

02:35.569 --> 02:36.950
Milk was cow, wasn't it? Yeah.

02:41.215 --> 02:50.246
Bread, bread was deal.

02:51.808 --> 03:02.140
Try to recall and share with me some of the pranks, 
the jokes, the good bull that you knew about,

02:51.808 --> 03:02.140
whether you were involved or not, that you knew. 
Well, I think I can tell you that. Yeah. One of the

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
guys, the old thing, the real

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
type

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
of mask,

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
he was holding

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
one of the infantry companies

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
where the regimental

03:06.141 --> 03:54.570
cannon for the infantry. He said, last week, he 
said, boy, this guy can scare the wits out of any

03:54.550 --> 04:02.060
body, anybody. He said, if you, he said, if you ever 
pass Keeley up leading, I'll get

04:02.040 --> 04:31.420
him to come over and play as a sleeper, but if you'll 
have him in,

04:02.040 --> 04:31.420
that is great. And this guy came over, and I mean, he 
was something. He was something else. He'd, he

04:34.400 --> 04:36.500
could fix it when he's sloppy.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.501
And there he'd be. Yeah.

04:45.594 --> 04:49.730
Yeah.

04:49.710 --> 04:52.179
Yeah.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.390
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

05:08.319 --> 05:08.420
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

05:22.428 --> 05:22.810
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

06:01.730 --> 06:02.546
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.109
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
Yeah. Yeah.

06:44.820 --> 07:23.500
as fish ever do any play any jokes on a sophomore can 
you think of any retaliation don't

06:44.820 --> 07:23.500
ever

06:44.820 --> 07:23.500
do

07:23.480 --> 08:12.410
it any drown outs of sophomores

07:23.480 --> 08:12.410
big beer tradition this

07:23.480 --> 08:12.410
went

07:23.480 --> 08:12.410
on

07:23.480 --> 08:12.410
until

07:23.480 --> 08:12.410
a senior

07:23.480 --> 08:12.410
year

08:36.140 --> 08:50.450
deceased

08:36.140 --> 08:50.450
had a fish

08:36.140 --> 08:50.450
day

08:36.140 --> 08:50.450
just really

08:54.410 --> 09:00.850
anybody's

08:54.410 --> 09:00.850
connected with this

09:11.350 --> 09:28.720
no

09:11.350 --> 09:28.720
fish days instead of being moving to me only posted

09:38.370 --> 09:46.180
and neither did the battalion

09:38.370 --> 09:46.180
that if he is dealing directly with these company 
commanders I made him get married

09:46.160 --> 09:57.860
so I I had developed a friendship also

09:57.840 --> 10:16.700
to a situation I

10:16.680 --> 10:21.480
just need somebody to talk to that he's got to put up 
if

10:24.860 --> 10:37.840
i don't know how you

10:24.860 --> 10:37.840
can get that good and this big meeting

10:46.890 --> 10:57.290
everybody

10:46.890 --> 10:57.290
else got good except they finally now

10:57.890 --> 11:08.720
this this beer bust where was that little where was 
it physically it was west of the track and

11:08.720 --> 11:23.560
this was day or night okay and so your outfit would 
be there I know

11:23.540 --> 11:37.380
no no no dates after that now

11:37.360 --> 11:51.850
this was primarily beer was their food nobody

11:37.360 --> 11:51.850
else except the outfit no girls no Paris just

11:51.830 --> 12:02.120
would there be other outfits having parties at 
different places do

12:02.100 --> 12:14.790
you remember any other pranks played on 
sophomores or seniors or stealing somebody's

12:14.770 --> 12:54.020
footlocker was that a

12:14.770 --> 12:54.020
where would you hide them

12:14.770 --> 12:54.020
or did

12:14.770 --> 12:54.020
y'all

12:54.000 --> 13:02.760
play hall hockey

12:54.000 --> 13:02.760
that I know in the in the 60s they would play it with a 
ball with the ball in the hallway and you were to

13:02.740 --> 13:07.440
kick it through the door at the end of the hallway 
and it's kind of like like kickball where what tell

13:11.020 --> 13:19.680
me about the bull ring where was it what was it you 
walk the

13:19.660 --> 13:59.510
bull ring

13:19.660 --> 13:59.510
or

13:19.660 --> 13:59.510
infractions

13:19.660 --> 13:59.510
when when did you do that was there a time specific 
times in uniform where where where was it

14:37.940 --> 14:44.320
at what time did you get out of the way to get back to 
the ball what do you think the men and your outfit

14:44.300 --> 14:50.900
thought about you as a sophomore what kind of a 
sophomore were you

14:50.880 --> 15:50.730
what

14:50.880 --> 15:50.730
were the incentives for you to succeed at a&m the 
depression family what a Tell me about those.

16:43.630 --> 16:46.250
I think that's about everything else. All right, 
and you and your brothers are first-generation

16:48.650 --> 16:50.510
college students. Did either of your parents go to 
college? And you went to high school at

16:53.240 --> 16:55.500
Hallisville? Yes. How many in your senior class?

17:04.880 --> 17:09.800
Do you remember anything about the retention rate 
in your freshman, sophomore years?

17:24.340 --> 17:35.170
About how many would graduate in your outfit?

17:35.150 --> 17:36.094
Important question. Who were some of the 
memorable teachers, counselors, advisors,

17:42.520 --> 17:45.120
staff members? Tell me about as many of those as you 
can. Well, Dr. .

18:16.520 --> 18:29.410
What did he do?

18:29.390 --> 18:30.095
Chemistry?

18:33.597 --> 18:34.060
Physics? I'm just

18:34.040 --> 18:47.480
trying to think about the outstanding

18:34.040 --> 18:47.480
lecture. English? Math?

18:54.260 --> 18:56.280
Were there some characters that you remember?

19:15.720 --> 19:16.681
Describe him, please. Well, he was full of 
subject. He could bring it to you. Why was he satch?

19:27.570 --> 19:33.210
I think it was because of carrying that satchel. 
Describe Dr. Walton, President Walton's

19:33.190 --> 20:00.940
personality.

20:00.920 --> 20:01.511
Gilchrist. Describe him, please. That

20:03.100 --> 20:35.280
thing straightened

20:03.100 --> 20:35.280
out without

20:03.100 --> 20:35.280
all the dire things that there was about such a 
thing. In the core, were there some memorable core

20:40.960 --> 20:42.383
officials? We mostly did a

20:44.367 --> 20:59.220
good job later on

20:44.367 --> 20:59.220
after we went to Lucian's and returned to another 
engineering maintenance company

21:02.740 --> 21:08.930
down in the States and got what we were assigned as 
an engineering recommender. First thing you do at

21:11.800 --> 21:13.900
the back of the season, instead of training the 
engineering maintenance company. But at that

21:17.043 --> 21:21.920
time, we were very anxious to do this. I'm . . . You 
know, we were graduating early, not too early, but

21:22.840 --> 21:31.320
a few, two, three weeks early. And all of the 
engineers went to Sam Houston. Fort Sam?

21:41.432 --> 21:42.960
Fort Sam Houston. There wasn't a single one that 
wanted not to get his commission. I'm very

21:47.820 --> 22:10.600
fascinated with

21:47.820 --> 22:10.600
E-Square,

21:47.820 --> 22:10.600
physical examination,

22:10.580 --> 22:41.450
including

22:10.580 --> 22:41.450
I was called

22:10.580 --> 22:41.450
in and I was asked, possibly, to go to the medical

22:41.430 --> 22:54.340
center, and so one of the medical officers there 
was just 50% bigger than us, and it turned out it was

22:54.320 --> 23:03.610
E-Square and he was absolutely devastated. It 
wasn't like in the 50-meter wall where everybody

23:03.590 --> 23:07.110
wanted to go. We did not want to be busted out. Now, 
this is the spring of 41. What was your nickname?

23:15.840 --> 23:16.506
Just last? You didn't have any? Let's go to 
classroom behavior. Oh, OK. What kind of

23:23.200 --> 23:24.341
behavior? What kind of behavior? What were the 
expectations of class? How did y'all behave in

23:31.770 --> 23:35.200
class? Did you go to class regularly? Did you stay 
awake? We behaved. Was

23:40.544 --> 24:03.690
the roll checked?

24:03.670 --> 24:08.750
And grades went home. Did y'all even compute grade 
point ratios? Y'all didn't talk about GPA, did

24:13.230 --> 24:24.540
you?

24:24.520 --> 24:28.120
Now, you came planning to major in engineering. 
Right. And you stayed with engineering the whole

24:29.509 --> 24:32.910
way. All

24:32.890 --> 25:42.880
right, looking back, what were the most important 
courses that you took, and why?

25:42.860 --> 25:46.820
Had you done slide rule in high school? So that 
began. Was there a kind of...

25:55.880 --> 25:58.510
Where was the... Who taught you how to use the slide 
rule?

26:05.370 --> 26:08.550
Typical engineer freshmen took that. And how did 
you transport the slide rule from one place to

26:08.530 --> 26:10.111
another? Did you use the slide rule? No. OK. to 
another where did you all

26:11.970 --> 26:33.170
right

26:11.970 --> 26:33.170
among

26:11.970 --> 26:33.170
you engineers engineering was the the prime major 
was there any major on the campus that y'all looked

26:33.150 --> 26:53.530
down on made fun of teased about

26:33.150 --> 26:53.530
so

26:33.150 --> 26:53.530
that almost everybody was either an ag what was the 
most did any particular field of engineering have

27:00.600 --> 27:31.260
the largest enrollment was there one that was most 
popular

27:00.600 --> 27:31.260
let's talk about the library did y'all call it 
cushing or did you just cushing library or just the

27:31.240 --> 27:39.430
library uh and uh was it possible to go over there 
and find a corner to snooze it to sleep in and

27:39.410 --> 27:52.780
did y'all see

28:38.690 --> 28:52.820
and it just it just really started

28:38.690 --> 28:52.820
so did that have a name doing that all right see i 
haven't heard that one before would that happen

29:01.450 --> 29:01.952
when you got caught right then right back to the 
library uh how about how much time did you spend in

29:02.090 --> 29:10.870
the library uh and your academic load per semester 
was normally what and you graduated in what four

29:10.850 --> 29:24.460
years

29:33.940 --> 29:59.570
all right the ymca what what role did it play in the 
campus

29:33.940 --> 29:59.570
describe let's go back you said your group 
mentioned mentioned what what that was

29:59.950 --> 30:15.100
were

29:59.950 --> 30:15.100
there were there similar groups for other who was 
the key leader was there an advisor or

30:15.080 --> 30:29.260
who who headed the ymca then was it mr cashin red 
cashin's dad and

30:30.760 --> 30:44.900
let's see what else happened in the wide what well 
that was That was a place where we...
