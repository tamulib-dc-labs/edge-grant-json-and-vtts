00:02.866 --> 00:09.994
Think back to your acquaintances, but in general to the student body.

00:11.616 --> 00:16.942
There must have been some rich and poor and country and city.

00:18.323 --> 00:24.450
And you mentioned a Cajun and there must have been some Hispanic.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.352
Oh, yeah.

00:26.372 --> 00:31.438
What difference did those backgrounds make at A&M?

00:34.220 --> 00:37.144
I'm not sure I'm following your question here.

00:37.164 --> 00:42.291
Did it matter if you were a city kid or a country kid, rich or poor?

00:42.651 --> 00:42.831
No.

00:43.052 --> 00:43.592
Why didn't it?

00:45.515 --> 00:50.842
Well, perhaps because we didn't have the fraternities, we didn't have the elitism.

00:52.084 --> 00:54.146
There was no elitism in it.

00:54.166 --> 00:58.873
Are you saying to me that A&M is inclusive instead of exclusive?

00:59.814 --> 01:00.375
Oh, yeah.

01:00.575 --> 01:02.117
Yeah, very definitely.

01:02.317 --> 01:05.280
Did you know any Jewish kids in the student body?

01:05.700 --> 01:06.441
Any Greek kids?

01:06.461 --> 01:06.821
Jewish.

01:07.602 --> 01:08.623
Were there some Jewish kids?

01:09.384 --> 01:11.486
Oh, yeah, I knew a few Jewish kids.

01:11.666 --> 01:13.047
I don't think I knew very many.

01:13.208 --> 01:14.929
I had known more in the service.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.891
Were there some Catholic kids?

01:17.232 --> 01:19.474
Oh, yeah, not very many again, but some.

01:20.895 --> 01:25.039
And I presume, okay, so they were, so what?

01:25.199 --> 01:26.080
Doesn't matter to me.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.944
No, doesn't matter to me.

01:32.472 --> 01:36.997
I don't say this with any feel of pride or anything else.

01:38.358 --> 01:41.542
But racism is not in my vocabulary.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.226
Ethnicity doesn't matter to me.

01:45.907 --> 01:49.391
I don't care what the color of somebody's skin is or what their religion is.

01:49.831 --> 01:50.592
It's what's in there.

01:52.234 --> 01:59.762
And I think as a kind of an outside observer that that has been true at A&M

02:00.046 --> 02:00.947
for a long time.

02:01.468 --> 02:02.969
Come on, sit down.

02:03.009 --> 02:08.415
If you want to be part of this campfire, come join us and do your share and you are accepted.

02:08.776 --> 02:12.399
I never saw anybody at all.

02:13.000 --> 02:26.695
As I try to think back, I can't remember seeing any evidence of discrimination or dislike because somebody was a Jew or a black or Hispanic

02:27.670 --> 02:30.074
Hispanics, they were very popular.

02:31.556 --> 02:32.678
Very popular.

02:32.798 --> 02:33.359
Most of them.

02:33.759 --> 02:38.186
Of course, I know we didn't see a total cross-section.

02:38.607 --> 02:43.254
We just saw those that had the motivation and drive to go on.

02:44.336 --> 02:51.687
What were the formal events that you think contributed to this inclusiveness at A&M?

02:54.046 --> 02:58.372
Oh, the formal event, you're probably talking about April 21st.

02:58.453 --> 03:00.195
Okay, there's one.

03:00.496 --> 03:00.916
Yeah.

03:02.418 --> 03:02.879
What else?

03:03.520 --> 03:06.925
That the school, that was kind of an organized event.

03:06.965 --> 03:08.047
That's what I mean by formal.

03:08.427 --> 03:09.229
It wasn't an accident.

03:09.249 --> 03:14.356
It was an organized event.

03:14.376 --> 03:18.863
Well, I suppose for many kids, the membership in the Corps.

03:19.103 --> 03:19.564
Okay.

03:21.265 --> 03:23.107
That didn't affect us.

03:23.828 --> 03:34.561
And there were a lot of, and I went back to A&M perhaps more than any other reason because of the Veterinary College.

03:35.622 --> 03:45.754
But I had a lot of very dear friends that were there, studied business, agriculture, engineering.

03:45.987 --> 03:59.765
I have a theory that silver taps and muster and midnight yelp practice and football games and commencements, as they're now done, where you call every name and shake hands, that all of those help.

04:00.086 --> 04:01.227
Oh, I'm sure they do.

04:01.247 --> 04:03.270
I would not argue with a bit of that.

04:05.273 --> 04:05.733
Let's see.

04:05.934 --> 04:10.440
Let's make believe somebody hands you a million-dollar check.

04:10.460 --> 04:12.282
There's only one condition on the check.

04:13.443 --> 04:19.415
They want you to give it to Texas A&M, and you decide what's going to be done with it.

04:19.435 --> 04:21.647
What would you tell them to do with that million dollars?

04:24.968 --> 04:45.410
Well, without a whole heck of a lot of thought just off the top of my head, I'd put the thing in a trust fund or an investment and let the dollars that were earned go to pay scholarships and tuition for needy kids, kids that needed some help.

04:45.430 --> 04:46.151
Majoring in?

04:47.633 --> 04:48.073
Whatever.

04:50.247 --> 04:52.332
I think we need all these fields.

04:52.352 --> 05:00.753
How would you select, of all the applicants, how would you select the recipients of these needy kids?

05:03.680 --> 05:05.725
How would I select them?

05:06.025 --> 05:25.083
Well, I would hope we'd have enough bases to look at the individuals, their home life, their background, how they had used everything they had to get as far as they could go.

05:25.103 --> 05:32.910
I'd look at their ability to do credible work.

05:33.667 --> 05:39.574
but I wouldn't place it on ACT scores or SAT scores totally.

05:44.740 --> 05:47.223
Do you have any Aggie ring stories?

05:47.303 --> 05:48.264
Many Aggies do.

05:49.105 --> 05:50.026
Do I have many what?

05:50.046 --> 05:51.368
Any Aggie ring story?

05:51.408 --> 05:55.132
Anything special that you've ever had happen to your ring or?

05:55.552 --> 05:59.217
No, except I had it enlarged.

05:59.237 --> 06:02.020
One of the reasons it's not worn smooth is because

06:02.557 --> 06:10.928
When I worked at the Veterinary College in Microbiology, I was always getting my hand scalded underneath that big wide ring.

06:11.669 --> 06:13.271
So I didn't wear it a lot.

06:13.811 --> 06:19.479
And then I couldn't wear it on my ring finger here.

06:20.039 --> 06:20.880
It would fit there.

06:21.221 --> 06:24.745
And I did wear it there some, but I didn't like to have two rings.

06:24.765 --> 06:30.032
So finally I had to have it enlarged because I have an old softball injury there.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.103
But you never lost it and somebody found it 15 years ago.

06:33.343 --> 06:33.924
No, never did.

06:34.825 --> 06:36.888
I hung to it somehow.

06:36.908 --> 06:37.328
Let's see.

06:37.989 --> 06:41.653
What have we left out that we should have talked about for your student days?

06:43.716 --> 06:44.817
Run that question again.

06:44.957 --> 06:46.058
What have we omitted?

06:46.979 --> 06:52.025
What have we forgotten about your A&M DVM student days?

06:52.265 --> 06:54.028
I think you've been very thorough.

06:55.069 --> 06:55.269
All right.

06:55.289 --> 06:58.753
Then the last question is a simple one.

06:59.678 --> 07:03.663
What feelings do you have in your heart for Texas A&M today?

07:08.728 --> 07:11.031
Well, I think Texas A&M is a good school.

07:11.772 --> 07:13.214
I think it's done a great job.

07:17.478 --> 07:24.066
I don't think it's necessarily as good as a lot of people think it is, but it's a good school.

07:26.712 --> 07:41.394
I think at times it's been under the influence of some people that have had a need to get out and see the world and see what some of the other schools are like.

07:44.299 --> 07:51.690
You know, Michigan and Harvard and Ohio State, they're not all bad either, you know.

07:52.548 --> 08:03.878
So some of the things that happened and I've seen happen at A&M, I thought they were under the leadership of people that didn't have a broad view.

08:04.819 --> 08:14.788
There was too much of the fact that the governor appoints the people that pay the most into his coffers.

08:16.150 --> 08:19.753
And we get somebody like Mr. Weisenbaker

08:21.168 --> 08:25.134
that shouldn't be there.

08:27.057 --> 08:32.626
But then I've worked at four other universities, and they all have their Weisenbakers too.

08:34.669 --> 08:36.011
So I think it's a great school.

08:36.792 --> 08:38.014
All right.

08:38.635 --> 08:41.700
But shift your thinking just a little now.

08:42.381 --> 08:44.404
How do you as an individual feel?

08:44.524 --> 08:47.749
What emotional feelings do you have about that school?

08:51.678 --> 08:54.024
Gratitude, love, admiration?

08:54.064 --> 08:57.994
I have all those.

08:58.014 --> 09:02.526
I consider the fact that I was able to go there, I'm very fortunate.

09:04.672 --> 09:06.116
Very, very, very fortunate.

09:06.657 --> 09:07.459
Just quit on that.
