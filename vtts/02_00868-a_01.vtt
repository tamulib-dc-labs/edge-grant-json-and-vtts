00:03.693 --> 00:04.274
Good morning. This is April 6, 1985. We are in the 
living room of Bob Cornish, and I am Bob Cornish.

00:14.245 --> 00:19.250
And I'm interviewing Robert Ashcroft from San 
Antonio this morning. Bob has been a longtime

00:20.912 --> 00:28.300
activist in planning matters in San Antonio. And 
Bob, I'd like to start out first with going back to

00:29.090 --> 00:48.111
the origins of San Antonio briefly and describing 
the influence of the Spanish Law of the Indies on

00:29.090 --> 00:48.111
San Antonio and what remains of it at the present 
time. Well, I think that we've got to recognize

00:49.413 --> 00:55.840
with San Antonio early 18th century that It was a 
Spanish colonial settlement. San Antonio was

01:00.446 --> 01:06.853
also significant because it had all three of the 
Spanish types of settlement. It had the

01:06.873 --> 01:10.076
religious, the military, and the civil. And all of 
those had a great deal of influence on San Antonio.

01:16.483 --> 01:24.612
Of course, the first was the religious with the 
missions, and five of which still exist in various

01:16.483 --> 01:24.612
states of of restoration and repair. The 
Presidia, which was the first

01:29.163 --> 01:38.316
military settlement, is at the heart of downtown. 
The original square is where City Hall is today,

01:38.396 --> 01:45.546
and that dates from about 1730 or 1731. And then 
about,

01:46.146 --> 01:52.455
I guess a decade or so later, the Pueblo, the first 
civil settlement, which was the Canary

01:53.195 --> 02:06.248
Islanders, was the next plaza to the east, which 
today is where the courthouse is, and that's known

01:53.195 --> 02:06.248
as Main Plaza. And a lot's been written about the 
significance of those early planned settlements

02:07.309 --> 02:22.223
on San Antonio, and they still maintain an 
influence today, both in terms of the street

02:22.658 --> 02:31.707
system and the system of plazas and squares and 
open spaces downtown, as well as the influence of

02:22.658 --> 02:31.707
the missions on later planning. For example, the 
whole effort to deal with the San Antonio River

02:31.847 --> 02:46.501
corridor that reemerged in the 1960s and the river 
walk at an earlier period of time. And as I said,

02:48.082 --> 02:50.725
people like reps. And others have documented 
extensively the plans of those settlements and

02:51.177 --> 03:05.457
their influence, not only on San Antonio's 
development over a period of time, but their

02:51.177 --> 03:05.457
influence on American planning.

03:15.680 --> 03:21.472
So the early plans were influenced by the Spanish 
and the Canary Islanders. Let's move ahead to the

03:22.915 --> 03:31.753
introduction of formal professional planning 
into San Antonio. OK. Let me just say as kind of a

03:31.773 --> 03:36.523
transition thing, What we're talking about with 
respect to the Spanish and their formal plans

03:37.178 --> 03:44.086
dates from the early 18th century. And if one looks 
at the rest of the 18th century and most all of the

03:45.107 --> 03:59.803
19th century, there was very little formal city 
planning being undertaken in San Antonio. I think

04:01.305 --> 04:03.287
it's interesting to note that toward the latter 
half of the 19th century, post-Civil War period,

04:04.330 --> 04:21.912
particularly after 1880, that we started seeing 
put in place in San Antonio some of those elements

04:04.330 --> 04:21.912
that would later affect some of the planning. In 
other words, we saw the first efforts to do

04:22.052 --> 04:28.099
large-scale development. Communities like 
Alamo Heights and then the area along around what

04:33.372 --> 04:38.657
is today known as Woodlawn Lake, which was then 
known as West End Lake. These were fairly large

04:39.357 --> 04:42.620
scale planned developments. And I think Alamo 
Heights as a community is particularly

04:43.140 --> 04:51.087
interesting in terms of its street pattern. It's 
kind of a curvilinear street pattern, which is

04:51.107 --> 04:58.694
very unusual for that period of time in San 
Antonio. And in fact, it's unusual for San Antonio

04:58.774 --> 05:03.278
until relatively recently because San Antonio 
grew by the use of just adding grids, the gridiron

05:03.950 --> 05:17.906
street pattern, and it wasn't necessarily just a 
continuation. One person that needs to be talked

05:18.266 --> 05:31.341
to, and he's got a great set of graphics that depict 
the development of San Antonio's gridiron street

05:18.266 --> 05:31.341
pattern over a period of of 150 years is a San 
Antonio architect by the name of Alex Caragon,

05:31.979 --> 05:43.033
C-A-R-A-G-O-N-N-E,

05:31.979 --> 05:43.033
and he's with Caragon Reyna. And Alex developed a 
set of maps that showed how San Antonio evolved

05:43.493 --> 05:51.143
with this gridiron street pattern. Getting back 
to my point, we saw developers for the first time,

05:51.163 --> 05:59.573
we saw the street railway system initially being 
an ox drawn, the first line, an ox drawn system, the

05:59.907 --> 06:16.272
first line extending from in front of the Alamo on 
Alamo Plaza up to San Pedro Park. And then later the

06:17.153 --> 06:26.607
electric companies came in and all of these had a 
substantial influence on how the community grew

06:27.143 --> 06:30.668
over a period of time. But up until really the 
1920s, there was no formal city planning in San

06:30.688 --> 06:41.823
Antonio. It was all being done sort of 
incrementally by the private sector. And it's not

06:46.930 --> 06:56.222
until the very late 1920s that we see for the first 
time an attempt on the part of the local government

06:56.641 --> 07:03.608
to do some what we recognize today as community or 
city planning. What caused the city to move in the

07:03.628 --> 07:08.834
direction of conscious city planning? Was there 
any event or series of events that indicated that

07:09.474 --> 07:18.223
the city should, in fact, have citywide planning? 
Well, I'm not sure that we could I'm not sure we

07:22.122 --> 07:34.581
could or anyone could identify a specific event or 
reason for the city consciously initiating a

07:22.122 --> 07:34.581
planning effort. I think probably, like most 
communities, San Antonio faced a lot of problems

07:34.601 --> 07:46.259
in terms of very rapid growth. What you've got to 
realize is that San Antonio's growth rate per

07:50.843 --> 08:08.909
decade, if you look at, say, from the 1880s to the 
1920s and 1930s, San Antonio literally went from a

07:50.843 --> 08:08.909
small

07:50.843 --> 08:08.909
frontier settlement to the largest metropolitan 
area in Texas. And it grew from 10,000 people to

08:09.710 --> 08:15.518
well over a quarter of a million people. Its growth 
rate per decade averaged 75% to 80%. So it was

08:20.045 --> 08:27.539
almost doubling in size each 10-year period of 
time. The cumulative effects of that growth over a

08:27.960 --> 08:34.873
period of time, particularly with the 
introduction of the automobile substantial

08:35.225 --> 09:04.405
increase in population I think led a lot of 
citizens and particularly some of the public

08:35.225 --> 09:04.405
officials to the point where they decided that it 
was important that a comprehensive look be made of

08:35.225 --> 09:04.405
the city and to see if there was anything 
consciously that the city could do to better deal

08:35.225 --> 09:04.405
with its growth and I think that this is true of most 
cities and it's true of Each period of time that San

09:04.958 --> 09:13.308
Antonio got serious about planning, and it wasn't 
just in the late 1920s, the same thing happened in

09:04.958 --> 09:13.308
the 1970s. It was in reaction to growth or growth 
issues. So I don't think it was a single event. I

09:20.296 --> 09:24.081
think it was just the cumulative effect of a lot of 
these things. Did the railroads have much effect

09:24.101 --> 09:32.090
on the growth of San Antonio in its early years?

09:33.652 --> 09:34.493
That would be right. before the Civil War and 
immediately after. I guess the railroads did to

09:39.686 --> 09:50.781
the extent that the railroads made San Antonio 
more accessible to the outside world. Over a

09:51.522 --> 10:04.581
period of about 30 or 40 years, San Antonio became a 
major terminus point for, I think, four major

10:04.831 --> 10:09.056
railroads. And there were four major railroad 
stations in San Antonio. So I think that had an

10:14.401 --> 10:18.526
effect on just the growth. I'm not sure how much 
effect it had in terms of development patterns,

10:18.646 --> 10:25.854
per se. I think that the intra-urban railway 
system, particularly the street railway system

10:34.514 --> 10:53.991
was much more significant to San Antonio in that 
frequently the land developer

10:34.514 --> 10:53.991
who bought several hundred acres on the outskirts 
of the city actually started a street railway

10:54.578 --> 11:04.295
system just to provide the access to the 
development so that he could sell lots. And in

11:04.615 --> 11:19.962
fact, what someone should do, Ann Morial Watson, 
who is currently the executive director of the San

11:04.615 --> 11:19.962
Antonio Conservation Society, wrote her 
master's thesis at Trinity University on a look at

11:20.363 --> 11:28.330
the street railway system in San Antonio and its 
contributions to the development of San Antonio.

11:28.350 --> 11:35.496
And I think that's a paper that if someone wants to 
get into this area, the detail needs to be looked

11:28.350 --> 11:35.496
at. So I think the local railways as opposed to the 
inter-urban railways had much more of an effect on

11:37.458 --> 11:44.264
San Antonio. In terms of its pattern. In terms of 
its development pattern. In terms of numbers,

11:49.574 --> 11:54.561
probably the railroads had quite an effect, I 
would think. Just in assisting growth. Right.

11:59.007 --> 11:59.428
Okay.

12:05.656 --> 12:12.626
Bob, when was the first legislative 
authorization of a comprehensive plan in San

12:05.656 --> 12:12.626
Antonio? Well, the first formal authorization 
came with our current charter. And let me explain

12:21.423 --> 12:26.089
the background of that a little bit because it is 
rather significant.

12:29.152 --> 12:42.447
In the very early 1950s, late 1940s, early 1950s, 
there was a substantial reaction among the

12:29.152 --> 12:42.447
progressive element in San Antonio about the 
correct corruption in municipal government. And

12:46.050 --> 12:50.056
it was a typical reform type of movement. And San 
Antonio had had a commissioned form of government

12:50.076 --> 13:03.994
dating back to about the 19- somewhere in the first 
decade of the 20th century. They established a

13:04.154 --> 13:10.763
commissioned form of government and had that for a 
period of almost 40 years. It was perceived as very

13:15.931 --> 13:17.554
corrupt. A group of citizens got together and

13:18.015 --> 13:34.624
drew up a charter for a council manager form of 
government, feeling that the council manager

13:18.015 --> 13:34.624
form of government was the best system that 
minimize political influence. The city would be

13:38.063 --> 13:50.596
run by a professional city manager, and the city 
council, although elected, would basically just

13:38.063 --> 13:50.596
set policy and not be involved in the day-to-day 
operation of government. And that involvement in

13:50.757 --> 13:56.422
the day-to-day operation of government was the 
thing that really bothered people. So in late

13:56.442 --> 14:00.747
1951, the charter was drawn up, It was approved by 
the voters in very early 1952, I think January

14:01.165 --> 14:12.442
1952, and the council manager for government came 
to San Antonio. Now, the significant thing about

14:12.942 --> 14:19.472
the charter, in addition to its form of 
government, is Article 9. In Article 9 of the city

14:19.572 --> 14:26.062
charter, established for the first time the 
planning function in San Antonio. And it did it in a

14:27.243 --> 14:29.687
very... substantial in explicit way. State 
statute makes no provision in Texas for the

14:35.858 --> 14:44.053
planning function of the municipal corporation. 
There's no mandated planning in Texas But the city

14:47.639 --> 14:53.146
charter, Article 9 in San Antonio, mandates 
planning. And it does so by, first of all, saying

14:53.166 --> 14:58.654
that the city shall have a master plan. It's not 
permissive. It's mandatory.

15:02.899 --> 15:07.706
That section of the article of the charter also 
creates the planning commission. It creates the

15:08.327 --> 15:10.029
planning department. It specifies... to a 
certain extent, and this is probably its greatest

15:12.850 --> 15:20.421
weakness, what is meant by a master plan. And 
there's only one sentence in there that explains

15:21.182 --> 15:26.229
what a master plan should be. But there's an entire 
section in there significantly explaining the

15:26.890 --> 15:34.320
legal effect of the master plan. So that once a plan 
is adopted in San Antonio, the plan has a

15:34.340 --> 15:42.351
substantial legal effect. and as I said, the plan 
is mandated there, so San Antonio's formal,

15:42.803 --> 16:04.652
official, legislative planning beginnings 
really date from January of 1952 with the start of

15:42.803 --> 16:04.652
the San Antonio Charter and particularly Article 
9 of that charter. That's interesting that there

16:04.712 --> 16:09.098
was such a late start in San Antonio. Most cities 
got planning underway in the 1910s or the 1920s

16:11.373 --> 16:36.553
with the standard acts and with starting with the 
standard zoning act and then of course the

16:11.373 --> 16:36.553
standard city planning enabling act after that 
and most states patterned their state enabling

16:11.373 --> 16:36.553
legislation after the standard acts which of 
course, has troubled United States planning to

16:37.107 --> 16:45.375
this day because they started out first with 
zoning and then went to planning after that. But

16:46.436 --> 16:49.779
maybe... Well, let me respond to that. First of 
all, the question was, when was San Antonio

16:50.220 --> 16:58.047
officially...

17:00.690 --> 17:03.833
When did San Antonio officially recognize 
planning their mandate? And that was the date,

17:04.153 --> 17:06.355
January 1952. That is not to say, A, that the city of 
San Antonio wasn't engaged in certain types of

17:06.638 --> 17:28.924
planning activities prior to that time, and it 
did, San Antonio had adopted zoning in November of

17:06.638 --> 17:28.924
1938, so it had zoning prior to planning. And some 
semblance of subdivision regulations, although

17:32.828 --> 17:44.120
The formal modern subdivision regulations in San 
Antonio really date from about 1958, although

17:32.828 --> 17:44.120
there were some semblances of those prior to that 
time. And some planning efforts that predated the

17:44.140 --> 17:52.950
1952 thing, but the official thing started in 
1952. What were the pre-official efforts in

17:53.371 --> 17:58.316
planning? Well, the major one Well, there were 
two. The first one was an attempt, and I started

18:04.795 --> 18:15.569
talking about this earlier, in the late 1920s to do 
a plan for the city of San Antonio. And the city

18:16.170 --> 18:31.810
appointed about, I guess, 50 or so members to a city 
plan commission.

18:32.431 --> 18:34.313
There were a committee, I guess it was called. 
There were 56 citizens on it. And in October of

18:38.798 --> 18:57.757
1929, the city, through this committee, 
contracted with Harlan Bartholomew and

18:38.798 --> 18:57.757
Associates out of St. Louis to work with the city to 
draw up a master plan for the city. The effort took

19:00.899 --> 19:05.966
four years and part of that was because of the 
nature of the committee. There were various

19:06.947 --> 19:10.592
subcommittees that worked with the consultant in 
different areas. Part of it was also the lingering

19:11.053 --> 19:14.398
effect of the depression. The city actually ran 
out of money at one point in time and broke off its

19:16.040 --> 19:29.218
relationship with Bartholomew and had not 
something been done, San Antonio would never have

19:16.040 --> 19:29.218
had that plan finished. what happened was some 
private citizens that were able to keep the effort

19:29.435 --> 19:36.448
going until the city had some additional funds. So 
the plan, Bartholomew finished the plan and

19:36.508 --> 19:48.491
delivered it to the city in March of 1933, and the 
city commission officially approved that plan.

19:49.232 --> 19:50.835
The plan itself was kind of an interesting 
document. First of all, it dealt largely with just

19:55.568 --> 20:03.078
the 36 square miles that was within the corporate 
limits at that time. San Antonio, when it became a

20:03.138 --> 20:14.732
legal entity during the Republic of Texas period, 
was originally charted as a 36 square mile area.

20:15.213 --> 20:19.398
Those boundaries did not change at all for over 100 
years. It wasn't until 1940 when when San Antonio

20:21.663 --> 20:27.569
did its first annexation of Los Angeles Heights, 
that those boundaries changed. So Bartholomew,

20:27.589 --> 20:36.099
in doing his planning in the early 1930s, just 
dealt basically with the 36 square mile area. So if

20:36.139 --> 20:42.626
you look at, he did produce a single plan graphic 
and a document. And the plan graphic is really kind

20:42.646 --> 20:50.995
of a fascinating

20:42.646 --> 20:50.995
depiction of a lot of his ideas. related, most of 
his ideas related to open space, to parks, to

20:51.447 --> 21:04.587
boulevards connecting things, and those types of 
things which were very popular in those days.

21:04.607 --> 21:06.650
Yeah, the typical city beautiful plan. Yes, yes. 
Is a copy available? Yes, I am in the process. Now,

21:13.480 --> 21:19.389
there is only one copy available of the original 
colored graphic. I know where that is. I am having

21:21.333 --> 21:28.285
reproduced copies of that and written some high 
quality reproductions. That could be available

21:29.366 --> 21:31.009
for you. That could be, yes, and that can and will be 
available. And then there is a document that I

21:34.775 --> 21:45.433
think there were probably only four or five 
original copies of the report that Bartholomew

21:46.240 --> 21:49.584
submitted with the plan. And they were kind of 
interesting to see in there. Apparently they were

21:52.147 --> 21:57.033
just typewritten and they were carbon copies. And 
there is a bound volume of that that the city

21:57.954 --> 22:04.542
planning department has. But they do not have the 
graphic. The graphic is in private hands. Who has

22:09.868 --> 22:11.590
that? I don't want to disclose the name.

22:16.632 --> 22:20.797
So, but I'm making arrangements to have that 
regrouped. And it's kind of an amazing, an amazing

22:20.857 --> 22:25.622
document. As we'll see, hopefully, as we discuss 
later, a plan done by the, a plan graphic done by the

22:25.642 --> 22:44.884
city in the 1960s is also kind of an amazing thing to 
look at and to study and to see how well the planner

22:25.642 --> 22:44.884
did a job of both anticipating how the city might 
grow and coming up with some solutions to the

22:45.083 --> 22:53.075
problems that the city was facing. But the point is 
that in March of 33, the Bartholomew plan was

22:53.096 --> 22:59.486
adopted by the city commission. Not really much 
happened in terms of implementing that plan at

23:00.066 --> 23:05.775
all. Now normally, on that point, Bartholomew, 
whenever he contracted with a city, would insist

23:11.864 --> 23:24.057
on leaving one of his senior staff planners there 
to implement the plan, such as in Corpus Christi

23:11.864 --> 23:24.057
and or El Paso. But that doesn't seem to have 
happened in San Antonio. Well, yes. And the reason

23:30.764 --> 23:37.751
that probably didn't happen is because the 
governmental structure at that time had no

23:30.764 --> 23:37.751
provision for staff. In other words, in 1933, And 
in fact, up until the charter in 1952, there was no

23:41.733 --> 23:48.500
formal planning staff in the city. So one had to 
look at the city engineer or someone like that. And

23:54.988 --> 24:04.538
I think the real problem with the Bartholomew plan 
was the lack of structure and the lack of

23:54.988 --> 24:04.538
mechanisms to implement it. I think one could, and 
this is getting out on a limb, but one could

24:04.558 --> 24:11.706
probably say that that the adoption of the zoning 
ordinance in 1938, if one looked at the zoning

24:12.496 --> 24:40.208
districts that were proposed, and I think there 
were 13 original zoning districts, and went back

24:12.496 --> 24:40.208
and related those to some of the things in the 
Bartholomew plan, that the people that probably

24:12.496 --> 24:40.208
drew up the first zoning district map did refer to 
Bartholomew's plan. And that's an assumption on

24:40.863 --> 24:44.027
my part. But other than that... There seems to be a 
relationship. There seems to be some

24:48.132 --> 24:50.876
relationship there. But other than that, there 
really was not much of an effort, a formal effort,

24:51.076 --> 25:08.878
either through subdivision regulations, which 
were largely non-existent at that time, through

24:51.076 --> 25:08.878
capital improvement programs of any type, which 
also there weren't many significant... at that

25:09.095 --> 25:14.784
time, nor through zoning, nor through city staff 
to implement it. So, whereas Bartholomew, as you

25:14.804 --> 25:23.918
said, in other cities may have had the opportunity 
to put one of his persons in there, that just didn't

25:14.804 --> 25:23.918
occur. The other thing that's significant here is 
that, is that that plan came to the city at probably

25:30.408 --> 25:34.613
the worst time financially, and that's during the 
Depression. The city of San Antonio just had real

25:34.633 --> 25:40.801
problems providing basic services. And as I 
mentioned earlier, that it was only through the

25:41.041 --> 25:47.269
efforts of the private sector that the plan even 
got finished. If it was up to the city government,

25:47.369 --> 25:52.635
that plan probably would never have been 
finished. Speaking of that Depression era, San

25:53.616 --> 25:59.824
Antonio benefited quite a bit The Roosevelt 
administration, WPA and so forth, could you

26:00.327 --> 26:16.085
comment a bit about the public works 
administration and what they did to improve San

26:00.327 --> 26:16.085
Antonio? Well, yeah, most of that happened at the 
end of the 1930s into the 1940s, but That was

26:24.357 --> 26:37.040
probably the start of the whole era of project 
planning in San Antonio, which in my opinion has

26:24.357 --> 26:37.040
been a much stronger effort than comprehensive 
planning. Project planning, I mean, local

26:37.240 --> 26:47.378
government is involved, but rather than focusing 
on the entire city or an entire area, it dealt with a

26:37.240 --> 26:47.378
project. or a function. The first substantial 
effort was the restoration of the La Vita area,

26:50.433 --> 27:07.453
which occurred, that project started in the late 
1930s under Maury Maverick, who was mayor at that

26:50.433 --> 27:07.453
time. And then that was followed by the other major 
significant project, which was the Riverwalk,

27:07.473 --> 27:15.863
the Paseo Del Rio. Most of that construction 
occurred during the early 1940s. And those two

27:22.677 --> 27:29.665
projects, I think, really set the tone for project 
planning in San Antonio. And although they've

27:30.807 --> 27:45.343
come to have very significant consequences for 
the city of San Antonio, initially they didn't

27:30.807 --> 27:45.343
have a particular... effect in terms of creating a 
lot of additional development. The river walk,

27:48.577 --> 27:53.424
Upsit Doria, really sat for decades without 
anything being done. La Vita worked a little bit

27:53.904 --> 28:02.075
better than the river, but both of those were very 
early examples of something. And there were other

28:02.095 --> 28:06.842
projects, those were not the only two, but those 
were the two outstanding The WPA and the CCC and

28:07.413 --> 28:15.761
others accomplished literally dozens of 
projects in San Antonio. And also significantly,

28:16.381 --> 28:28.352
there

28:16.381 --> 28:28.352
was a lot of effort in the area of documentation. A 
lot of measured drawings were done during that

28:28.372 --> 28:33.196
period of time. Some guides were done. I've got 
copies of guides for both the river and lobby each

28:37.670 --> 28:44.076
of it were done by the WPA, pointing out how this 
whole thing turned out. Well, my understanding is

28:44.636 --> 28:52.864
that the Riverwalk situation came about largely 
because something had to be done about blood

28:44.636 --> 28:52.864
control. Correct. And the Los Olmos Dam was built 
to control the San Antonio River after the

28:53.945 --> 29:05.696
downtown had been flooded to a depth of six feet, I 
believe in 1925. Yeah. Well, the dam came much

29:07.319 --> 29:09.402
later. Correct. There was a devastating, well, 
there were a series of floods that occurred in the

29:12.266 --> 29:21.260
first couple of decades of the 20th century. I 
think it was 1923. I could be wrong on that date. It

29:25.867 --> 29:26.948
could have been 25. There was a major flood in 
downtown San Antonio, largely because of If one

29:33.965 --> 29:49.345
looks at the surface hydrology of San Antonio, 
above the headwaters of the San Antonio River in

29:33.965 --> 29:49.345
the Bracken Ridge Park area, above that is the 
whole Olmos River Basin. And what would happen is

29:50.166 --> 29:59.278
you would have huge rainfalls up there and that 
would just come right down through the middle of

29:50.166 --> 29:59.278
downtown. The reaction to that was let's do 
something about the river. Apparently the

30:03.291 --> 30:08.379
downtown merchants insisted that the city 
council do something. Yeah, and basically it was

30:08.399 --> 30:16.893
a, one of the proposals was a flood control 
proposal which would basically have put the river

30:08.399 --> 30:16.893
underground. And the reaction to that is the 
famous story about the birth of the San Antonio

30:22.042 --> 30:51.154
Conservation Society in the 1920s and Miss Emily 
Edwards who was its first president was the woman

30:22.042 --> 30:51.154
who prevailed upon the city commission at that 
time to quote unquote save the river in the famous

30:22.042 --> 30:51.154
puppet show and all that's been documented and 
that led then to the city holding off on doing

30:22.042 --> 30:51.154
something about that stringent flood control 
measure and that allowed the opportunity with

30:51.708 --> 31:05.842
Robert Huggman's idea later to come up with the 
Paseo Del Rio. Without the Conservation

31:06.984 --> 31:13.891
Society's initial effort, there wouldn't have 
been anything for Huggman to plan. He had no

31:14.511 --> 31:17.074
official role with the city. I think it was mostly 
with the conservation group. Well, Hugman's

31:22.882 --> 31:27.570
effort was kind of a separate effort from the 
society. Hugman worked directly with some

31:27.630 --> 31:40.834
downtown property owners, particularly Jack 
White, who at that time owned what was then the

31:27.630 --> 31:40.834
Plaza Hotel.
