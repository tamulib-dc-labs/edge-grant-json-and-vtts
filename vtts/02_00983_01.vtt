00:06.595 --> 00:18.893
This is an interview with Jane Gregory by Molly 
Aldrich on November 17, 1990 at her home

00:06.595 --> 00:18.893
concerning the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.182
Could you please state your name for us? Jane 
Gregory. Could you tell us when you were born? In

00:29.228 --> 00:32.673
1951 in Houston, Texas. And could you give us a 
little bit of background on your education?

00:38.590 --> 00:50.807
Well, being born in Houston in 1951 in a white 
family meant you lived on the southeast side of

00:38.590 --> 00:50.807
town over off Scott Street and in the University of 
Houston area. But in the 60s, the great white

00:52.069 --> 00:58.999
flight took off for southwest Houston. I remember 
when the first black family bought a home on our

00:59.820 --> 01:02.724
block. It was like the Purcell sons went up 
overnight. And I ended up in Bel Air High School.

01:11.849 --> 01:25.908
Well, I went to junior high and elementary school 
on the southwest side too, but I graduated from Bel

01:11.849 --> 01:25.908
Air High School in 1969 and then started the 
University of Texas in the fall of 69.

01:29.532 --> 01:34.519
Why did you become involved in the Civil Rights 
Movement?

01:37.523 --> 01:38.584
I guess Early on, I had a very clear idea of the fact 
that I lived in a prejudiced family. Maybe not

01:47.695 --> 01:53.061
prejudiced by Southern standards, but somehow 
prejudiced by my own standards. We had what my

01:54.523 --> 01:58.668
mother referred to as a negra maid. My mother 
thought that was very liberal of her to use that

02:00.009 --> 02:04.234
particular word. But she didn't eat lunch with us 
at our table. And I remember questioning my mom

02:08.039 --> 02:11.604
about that even really early. But I guess the thing 
that triggered the civil rights movement big time

02:12.084 --> 02:27.245
for me was the election year of 1968, when George 
Wallace and Curtis LeMay were running on the

02:12.084 --> 02:27.245
American Party ticket. And they were, as most 
people of my generation will remember, very

02:34.235 --> 02:41.404
outspoken for the rights and very down on any type 
of integration. And to make matters worse, my

02:43.046 --> 02:51.076
father had fought with Curtis LeMay during World 
War II and strongly supported the Wallace LeMay

02:43.046 --> 02:51.076
ticket. So while he was nailing up campaign signs 
and posting them in our front yard, I went to the

02:51.978 --> 03:01.710
other extreme. I suppose a way of not only 
supporting a cause I believed in, but also

03:02.315 --> 03:13.790
rebelling against those authoritarian ties that 
everybody needs to rebel against.

03:17.054 --> 03:20.999
What influenced your decision to join the 
Students for a Democratic Society?

03:23.642 --> 03:28.288
Well, there were several campus groups at the 
time.

03:29.720 --> 03:34.427
I was involved at first with just general peace 
marches. Now, the peace marches were primarily

03:34.827 --> 03:37.531
against the Vietnam War. Civil rights was sort of 
just a splinter of it. The big thing was the Vietnam

03:42.097 --> 03:47.665
War because it affected so many people my age. And 
it did not seem that the passive resistance was

03:48.066 --> 03:56.638
working at all. and that a more direct and perhaps 
more violent tactic was needed. And

04:03.583 --> 04:26.102
I listened to a lot of the Chicago 7 trials, and I had 
involvements with people who were in California

04:03.583 --> 04:26.102
and Oregon and on the West Coast and persuaded me 
that the SDS would be the only way we could affect

04:26.504 --> 04:29.829
the change. How many were in the UT chapter and what 
years were you involved in it? I was only in it for

04:37.201 --> 04:39.225
one year in 1969. Well, 1969, 70. By 70,

04:42.009 --> 04:52.967
I had become so disillusioned. with the United 
States in general that I left the country.

04:59.553 --> 05:14.719
But in the UT chapter, at the time, now I don't know 
how many card-carrying SDS members there were,

04:59.553 --> 05:14.719
but I know of at least 200 active, active people 
that I could call at any time with any crazy idea or

04:59.553 --> 05:14.719
plot or any type of... anarchist idea that would 
cause or disrupt normal campus activities to a

05:16.555 --> 05:24.924
point that we could make our point.

05:28.008 --> 05:30.931
What was your view on American involvement in 
Vietnam? I was totally opposed. And

05:35.116 --> 05:45.988
I had two cousins fighting in that particular war, 
and my family was extremely

05:46.812 --> 05:51.198
agitated with me for being involved. The civil 
rights movement had been bad enough, but to march

05:51.298 --> 06:08.461
against the government of the United States and to 
go on to the Capitol grounds, there was a big

05:51.298 --> 06:08.461
protest march that we were involved in where the 
students attempted to take over the state

05:51.298 --> 06:08.461
Capitol. And that was my first experience with 
tear gas, a very pleasant one. And

06:16.259 --> 06:29.819
Lyndon Johnson, being from Texas, I guess even 
insulted them more that I would be against the war.

06:29.899 --> 06:34.907
But total opposition to the war is the only way I can 
express it. I felt it was morally wrong, and I felt

06:34.927 --> 06:39.934
that people were dying over there for no just 
reason. I didn't feel like the United States had

06:39.954 --> 06:42.638
any business in Vietnam. Friends in SDS and other 
groups had said that Cambodia was next on the list,

06:43.225 --> 06:49.954
and they were sure right about that. To

06:49.994 --> 06:56.182
answer your question, I was totally opposed.

06:59.326 --> 07:06.516
How many other organizations were you involved 
with during the 60s movement?

07:07.120 --> 07:17.675
When you belong to SDS, first of all, you didn't go 
around announcing particularly that you were in

07:07.120 --> 07:17.675
SDS because it could get you in a whole lot of 
trouble. So there was a different group that was

07:18.216 --> 07:27.108
much more peaceful in nature. It was a University 
of Texas group. I'm trying to remember the name.

07:35.579 --> 07:36.300
Goodness gracious.

07:40.645 --> 07:46.573
Well, Students Against the Vietnam War or 
Students Opposed to the Vietnam War. I can't

07:46.613 --> 07:52.040
remember the initial or the acronym for it, but I 
was involved in that. But most of the other groups

07:52.080 --> 08:01.191
that I became involved in, I did it just to shield my 
membership in SDS because I didn't... If I was

08:03.078 --> 08:13.934
associated with more peaceful groups and active 
in a few of the more peaceful demonstrations, I

08:03.078 --> 08:13.934
never missed a demonstration. And at the time, 
college professors were most understanding. I'd

08:20.404 --> 08:26.793
say the majority of the faculty in all of the 
classes I took, my professors were against the

08:20.404 --> 08:26.793
Vietnam War. I spent very little time in class, 
actually, the first semester at the University of

08:27.474 --> 08:32.562
Texas.

08:34.803 --> 08:41.411
But you could get credit if you went to the peace 
marches and marched with your professors, and I

08:34.803 --> 08:41.411
was there. It was a lot more fun than studying 
anthropology.

08:48.641 --> 08:53.887
What types of demonstrations were you involved 
in, and could you explain the different ones?

08:55.710 --> 09:01.317
Well, the one I mentioned earlier, the largest 
demonstration I suppose I was ever involved in was

08:55.710 --> 09:01.317
the the march onto the state capitol grounds. And 
there were thousands of students there,

09:07.217 --> 09:12.283
literally thousands. And I'm not sure at what 
point we marched from the campus to the capitol

09:13.164 --> 09:19.432
building. And there were police the whole way 
along, but they didn't seem, they were there and

09:20.233 --> 09:26.241
they were policing the crowds. but they did not 
seem really concerned. We joked around with them a

09:30.826 --> 09:32.569
lot. We kidded with them a lot, like, come on, join 
us, and they'd give you the peace sign, and you'd

09:32.589 --> 09:43.588
flash it back, and we'd pass construction workers 
and people on the way and just kid around. There was

09:43.909 --> 09:48.617
none of the angriness that you sometimes see 
where, construction workers would get in

09:49.103 --> 09:58.198
confrontations with students or scream about 
communists or anything like that. It was such a

09:58.678 --> 10:00.902
mild day. I remember that most about it. And there 
were a lot of speeches on the Capitol grounds by

10:03.486 --> 10:07.272
various speakers. And I'm not sure exactly at what 
point it was decided that or who was speaking that

10:13.741 --> 10:19.489
encouraged us to literally try to take over the 
Capitol building. But that appealed to a great

10:19.589 --> 10:26.579
number of people I was particularly standing 
there with, including my psychology professor.

10:27.841 --> 10:34.630
And so we literally went into the rotunda of the 
State Capitol building in an attempt to take over

10:27.841 --> 10:34.630
the State Capitol building. Now, being young and 
not real clear on the idea, I'm not sure what we

10:34.670 --> 10:43.242
thought that would accomplish in retrospect. I do 
know that that's when the day turned ugly because

10:43.728 --> 10:55.865
that's when the police were ordered in and tear gas 
was thrown in and a number of us were arrested. I was

10:55.925 --> 11:03.776
arrested and was taken down to the Austin jail 
where we spent the night away singing peace songs,

10:55.925 --> 11:03.776
you know, we shall overcome. All we were saying is 
give peace a chance. Having a great old time. My

11:10.897 --> 11:16.425
parents, however, did not look at this as a good 
time when they arrived in Austin to get me out of

11:10.897 --> 11:16.425
jail. Other demonstrations, I went to Atlanta for 
one demonstration,

11:18.649 --> 11:30.647
and I went to New Orleans for another 
demonstration. The one in Atlanta was a civil

11:30.727 --> 11:37.798
rights, and the one in New Orleans was a... meeting 
of planning committees for SDS and what we could do

11:39.145 --> 11:53.623
on college campuses, and it was

11:39.145 --> 11:53.623
not a publicized meeting. But while there, we were 
on the LSU campus, and we did meet with various

11:53.643 --> 12:00.432
other people. There was another meeting out in 
Berkeley that year, but I was not able to go to

12:00.852 --> 12:07.701
California.

12:08.440 --> 12:19.698
California, the West Coast was a hotbed for SDS 
activity, and I did communicate by letter with

12:08.440 --> 12:19.698
various people involved in that. But I did not make 
the Berkeley meeting that year, which proved to be

12:20.800 --> 12:33.300
the one I should have made as far as

12:20.800 --> 12:33.300
a lot of things going on and happening.

12:37.145 --> 12:40.510
What makes your generation different from your 
parents' generation?

12:46.499 --> 12:52.368
I guess my generation was different because we not 
only questioned the government. We didn't just

12:52.408 --> 12:55.272
sit back on the porch and complain about taxes. We 
took to the streets and let the government know

12:55.773 --> 13:01.502
that we were really pissed off. That this just 
wasn't going to fly. That they no longer had the...

13:06.203 --> 13:16.776
Authority, in our estimation, are the right to 
determine who would die and who would live a good

13:06.203 --> 13:16.776
life. A lot's been made of the generation gap, and 
it wasn't a gap. It was the Grand Canyon. I watched

13:26.368 --> 13:32.295
my friends and myself, those years with our 
families, were horrible. I don't remember a

13:34.251 --> 13:50.028
single dinner when I would go home or at the 
holidays that wasn't disrupted by a huge family

13:34.251 --> 13:50.028
fight and ended with me storming out or my mother in 
tears or my father cursing and ranting and raving.

13:50.668 --> 14:00.038
I mean, everything from the length of my brother's 
hair, you know, on that kind of trivial manner to

13:50.668 --> 14:00.038
the politics that that children that he felt he had 
raised and given every opportunity, and we were

14:00.507 --> 14:06.996
turning on them. We were throwing out all their 
ideals. God was dead. No respect for schools or

14:15.567 --> 14:22.676
teachers, certainly no respect for parents, no 
respect for the American flag or the American way.

14:22.696 --> 14:27.122
He felt, my father, my mother, that we were just 
doomed for communism. Women didn't wear bras.

14:30.530 --> 14:32.853
Guys let their hair grow down their backs. People 
were on drugs. This is how my parents saw it. They

14:38.781 --> 14:41.625
saw it on a very superficial level. And the more 
they carried on, the more we did, too. And the

14:49.115 --> 14:55.523
louder my father got, the more Archie Bunkerish, I 
suppose, he became. the more he drove me into

14:56.465 --> 15:01.732
knowing I didn't want to be like him, nothing like 
him. I didn't want to be like my mother. I didn't

15:03.054 --> 15:05.557
want to be under a husband's thumb.

15:08.481 --> 15:10.323
I wouldn't do that. And as a result, I became a very 
judgmental person of my parents' generation,

15:10.624 --> 15:25.543
just as judgmental of them as they were of me 
because I was so determined not to end up like them.

15:26.654 --> 15:37.610
My

15:26.654 --> 15:37.610
generation

15:26.654 --> 15:37.610
protested en masse. We got together on that. We 
were convinced that you couldn't just accept your

15:40.154 --> 15:47.004
government and think they were always right. My 
father, when he went into World War II, He went in

15:51.072 --> 15:57.663
because those goddamn Japanese snuck over there 
and did that to us. He went over there. He honestly

15:58.464 --> 16:09.703
believed he was fighting for the protection of 
democracy and to guarantee his children an

15:58.464 --> 16:09.703
American way of life, whereas it was a sham. It was 
just to make the rich even richer. And the thought

16:13.583 --> 16:19.771
that he just fell for that and couldn't see through 
what the government was doing just amazed me. I

16:19.871 --> 16:23.396
think my generation was better educated, more 
analytical.

16:27.181 --> 16:33.149
But my parents were probably more innocent and 
more happy, that generation. Even though they'd

16:33.390 --> 16:43.303
been through a depression and a world war, they 
thought they had suffered and now that they were

16:33.390 --> 16:43.303
living a good life and they couldn't understand 
why we just didn't and sit back and enjoy the fruits

16:43.891 --> 16:46.455
of their labor. And OK, the Vietnam War was here, 
and the young men had to go fight. But that was

16:50.121 --> 16:52.805
nothing that their fathers hadn't been willing to 
do. And I had another cousin, two cousins in the

16:52.925 --> 16:59.295
Vietnam War, and one cousin who went to Canada. 
That cousin was totally ostracized from the

17:00.336 --> 17:02.480
family. It was his name. His own mother struck his 
name out of the family Bible.

17:08.970 --> 17:09.831
Didn't forgive him.

17:12.595 --> 17:15.739
until amnesty was granted years later. And once 
the country forgave him, I guess she thought she

17:15.799 --> 17:22.007
could too.

17:27.774 --> 17:32.480
We were motivated by something that wasn't 
motivating our parents, I suppose. The American

17:34.282 --> 17:38.347
way didn't seem like such a big motivator to us. We 
were looking for a different way.

17:45.637 --> 17:51.423
What were some of the ways your organizations went 
about getting their message across or mobilizing

17:45.637 --> 17:51.423
support? Well, the demonstrations were big. And 
you would put signs up all over campus announcing

17:55.266 --> 18:03.775
big demonstrations and peace marches. And you'd 
bring in speakers. Jerry Rubin, we brought in

18:09.280 --> 18:15.306
Lawrence Ferlinghetti, a poet at the time out in 
California. He still is a poet. To read

18:22.506 --> 18:35.728
controversial poems at the time, any poem that had 
the word fuck in it was just considered wonderful,

18:22.506 --> 18:35.728
even if its poetic merits were nil. But it was such a 
controversial time. The word has lost some of its

18:38.954 --> 18:42.019
impact, but at the time to have a an adult stand up in 
a public place and read a poem with that kind of word

18:42.286 --> 18:59.940
in it, especially if it was referred to as the 
fucking Vietnam War, then, you know, you could be

18:42.286 --> 18:59.940
assured that that speaker would get a rousing 
ovation and cheers.

19:02.047 --> 19:15.884
SDS would use these peace marches or 
demonstrations a lot of times because so many

19:02.047 --> 19:15.884
people would be off campus to do, when I look back on 
it, it's probably more practical jokes than

19:02.047 --> 19:15.884
anything. Although it was disruptive at the time, 
they would cut phone wires in the administration

19:16.264 --> 19:23.193
building. They would go around and jam locks to 
major doors so that people couldn't get in to their

19:31.780 --> 19:39.874
offices or buildings. That seemed to be one of 
their favorites. Flag burnings were another way

19:43.279 --> 19:56.742
that you could always draw a big crowd along with

19:43.279 --> 19:56.742
draft burning And everybody would just come, and 
the guys would have their draft cards, and it'd

19:57.025 --> 20:03.152
just take a couple of them to start throwing them in 
there. And the next thing you know, you'd have a

20:03.933 --> 20:07.558
pretty good fire.

20:11.262 --> 20:16.489
I guess another way support was gathered was 
through drugs. And marijuana was a big drug at the

20:17.049 --> 20:24.298
time, along with LSD, but... He knew if somebody 
had pot and joints started passing around, he knew

20:24.920 --> 20:39.099
that

20:24.920 --> 20:39.099
more people would probably end up burning their 
draft cards that night than might have otherwise.

20:40.280 --> 20:46.388
So it was always good to keep drugs and take drugs to 
these marches. Everybody smoked marijuana, and

20:47.212 --> 21:00.163
by everybody I mean everybody I knew or had 
anything in common with, my professors, my

20:47.212 --> 21:00.163
friends, people that I'd known to be perfectly 
quote unquote straight people.

21:02.686 --> 21:05.148
Music was another way of getting support. Janis 
Joplin was big at the time. The Beatles started

21:07.310 --> 21:11.013
getting really big into the peace movement. You'd 
blare these records on huge speakers across the

21:11.033 --> 21:15.497
campus, start passing around a joint or two, and 
the next thing you knew, you were willing to march

21:16.827 --> 21:23.162
again wherever people wanted to go. So you

21:23.182 --> 21:29.537
think.

21:36.149 --> 21:49.602
At the flag burnings, this is when hostility 
sometimes would come out between the community

21:36.149 --> 21:49.602
and the campus because a lot of people have very 
strong feelings about the flag. When the flag

21:50.662 --> 22:03.094
would be burned, sometimes there would be 
somebody who would rush in and try to yank it out of a

21:50.662 --> 22:03.094
fire or start screaming at people who were doing it 
and the name calling would begin and everything.

22:03.134 --> 22:07.398
But these people were really few, very few and hard 
between. And I don't suppose any discussion at

22:08.379 --> 22:18.289
this time of different things that people did at 
this time would be complete without at least

22:08.379 --> 22:18.289
mentioning sex. And I guess sex was another way we 
really had of motivating people because the free

22:19.552 --> 22:34.713
love, that Haight-Ashbury summer and everything 
became a real focal point. And it was neat to be in

22:34.973 --> 22:40.260
the group I was in because you could have You could 
have many different sexual partners and enjoy

22:41.202 --> 22:48.890
sex, and certainly the stigmatism was off it. It 
wasn't like only bad girls did that or only tramps

22:48.910 --> 22:53.515
did that. I mean, it was part of the movement. It was 
free love, and it was considered cool, and you

22:55.037 --> 23:04.307
could do that and not have a name on you. And at the 
time, I really believed that having sex with

23:04.608 --> 23:14.918
someone was nothing more than just an extension of 
friendship and a sharing of common goals and

23:04.608 --> 23:14.918
bonds. And this was a person, certainly I didn't 
intend to marry, but that we shared that

23:14.958 --> 23:24.988
particular experience and mix in the drugs and the 
sex. And you attracted a lot of young men to your

23:25.108 --> 23:30.073
movement. I mean, think about it. You're 18, 19 
years old. You're away from home for the first

23:32.215 --> 23:33.957
time. The girls are all into this peace stuff and 
with it comes drugs and sex. Seemed pretty good.

23:41.791 --> 23:52.582
Kent State was a big mobilizing factor when the 
National Guard was called in and students were

23:41.791 --> 23:52.582
actually killed on a college campus by the 
National Guardsmen. And that became a real focal

23:53.543 --> 24:00.450
point of how bad things had gotten in the country 
when now we had guardsmen firing on college

24:01.426 --> 24:10.079
students who were actually exercising their 
right to express their opinions, freedom of

24:01.426 --> 24:10.079
speech. It tore the country apart, Kent State. It 
brought everything to a head here. It's one thing

24:18.071 --> 24:29.188
to send your son off to the Vietnam War where you 
know the likelihood that he'll be killed is great,

24:18.071 --> 24:29.188
but to send your sons and daughters to school and 
have the National Guard, who, let's face it, your

24:30.265 --> 24:36.594
tax dollars were going to support, fire upon your 
children. That brought a lot of parental support

24:37.396 --> 24:45.407
to the side of the peace

24:37.396 --> 24:45.407
movement. How do you feel the music affected your 
generation?

24:51.677 --> 24:51.817
Oh. Well, I don't feel as strongly as Plato did 
that. Music must be controlled, or as Aristotle

24:59.442 --> 25:04.548
did, that music must be censored. But I do think it 
had a profound effect. The music seemed perfectly

25:09.374 --> 25:20.487
geared to what we were fighting about and what we 
were trying to push, the civil rights ideas. He

25:21.868 --> 25:22.449
ain't heavy. He's my brother. The idea of free 
love. and drugs and goodness. It just went hand in

25:34.848 --> 25:39.174
hand with the movement of the time. Woodstock in 
the summer of 1969, the summer after I graduated

25:39.555 --> 25:51.613
from high school, my parents refused to let me go, 
would not let us go. Threatened me with everything

25:51.633 --> 25:58.423
in the world if I went, so of course I went. My best 
friend Colleen and I and one other girl told our

25:59.129 --> 26:07.821
parents, asked our parents, we told them, 
whatever, we were going to the beach. And that

26:08.983 --> 26:13.389
night, we called from Atlanta just to say we were 
going. And I'll never forget, my father said, I

26:13.409 --> 26:18.315
said, he said, why aren't you home? And I said, I'm 
not coming home. I'm in Atlanta. We're going to

26:20.478 --> 26:21.540
Woodstock. And he said, like hell. And I just hung 
up and kept going. And I guess that was pretty much

26:27.732 --> 26:48.152
my... That was a particularly awakening 
experience for a little Texas bush popper from

26:27.732 --> 26:48.152
Texas out here, because I'd never been out of the 
state of Texas across that infamous Mason-Dixon

26:27.732 --> 26:48.152
line at any rate. And now I was up in what my parents 
refer to as Yankee territory, God knows. And... It

26:56.605 --> 27:03.213
was a rainy, it was cold to me, and I got very sick 
there, but I loved every minute of it. I loved the

27:03.673 --> 27:09.080
fact that people could, the music just seemed to be 
able to make people totally lose themselves. For

27:09.100 --> 27:20.273
the first time, I saw the real power of music and how 
you could just totally get in to it and just not care

27:09.100 --> 27:20.273
about anything else that was going on around you. 
Of course, there were a lot of drugs there. And it

27:23.015 --> 27:26.959
seemed that drugs were not expensive at all. 
People were selling heads of acid for a buck or two

27:28.380 --> 27:32.163
bucks. And you could get, oh gosh, you could get an 
ounce of marijuana

27:32.944 --> 27:46.937
for, you could get an ounce of marijuana for 30, oh 
gosh, less than 30, 20, 15, depending on what. A lot

27:47.598 --> 27:50.400
of times you didn't have to pay for it at all. You 
just sat there and somebody would pass you around

27:50.420 --> 27:52.482
the joint and it would go on, but to get back to the 
music issue, the music was drug-oriented in a lot

27:53.153 --> 28:02.382
of ways. Lucy in the Sky of Diamonds, of course, 
being the big LSD song of the time, and Janis

28:02.723 --> 28:21.962
Joplin, and me and Bobby McGee, and gosh, the 
Yellow Submarine, the whole idea that music was a

28:02.723 --> 28:21.962
fantastic voyage into the imagination, and Music 
was the prompt, I suppose, and we used it every

28:24.625 --> 28:33.256
chance we got. It was another way of rebelling 
against figures of authority because they really

28:33.476 --> 28:42.528
saw this music as detrimental. And it was 
anti-American to a large extent. It was peace

28:45.972 --> 28:52.641
movement songs, anti-war songs, pro-choice, 
pro-drug, free love. Of course, that's all

28:54.207 --> 29:00.133
parents needed to hear to be turned off by it.

29:03.277 --> 29:04.918
Did you partake in drug use? Mm-hmm, certainly. 
Which drugs did you use, and what were your reasons

29:09.123 --> 29:12.507
for using them? I smoked a lot of marijuana. That 
was primarily the only drug I did. What were my

29:22.117 --> 29:23.218
reasons? Well,

29:23.992 --> 29:45.482
it was a way of... At the time, to turn down a joint 
that was passed to you in a demonstration would be

29:23.992 --> 29:45.482
like saying, no, I don't believe in this. I don't 
believe in any of this. Marijuana was like the

29:47.364 --> 29:49.667
common bond. It was like... I don't know, to 
compare it to two soldiers in a foxhole sharing a

29:51.515 --> 29:55.962
cigarette. It was another way of saying, I'm in 
this movement. My identification is with the

30:00.670 --> 30:06.219
peace movement, the civil rights movement, and 
with drugs. I believe everybody has a right to

30:06.300 --> 30:12.290
determine if they want to smoke it or not. It was 
another way of saying... hell no to the

30:15.680 --> 30:17.442
government. You're not going to impose this limit 
on me. You have no right to tell me this is illegal.

30:24.970 --> 30:28.494
Acid, I really didn't get into. I tried it once or 
twice in college and didn't like being that out of

30:28.514 --> 30:33.860
it. Marijuana seemed to focus things in for me, and 
acid seemed to totally remove me from them. And I

30:40.847 --> 30:42.749
didn't want to be totally removed. I wanted to have 
things I wanted, marijuana seemed to let me get

30:45.667 --> 31:02.971
really deep into my thoughts, and acid seemed to 
put me on another, or LSD seemed to put me in another

30:45.667 --> 31:02.971
area of thought, into a hallucinogenic world that 
I didn't really enjoy. I didn't want to leave this

31:03.312 --> 31:11.303
world, I just wanted to kind of make it mellower, 
because life at that time was not mellow. unless

31:12.346 --> 31:19.958
you were high, because otherwise you were so 
worried and so concerned about who you knew might

31:12.346 --> 31:19.958
be called to the Vietnam War next. Your black 
friends were always on your case. Either the Black

31:23.824 --> 31:37.105
Panther movement, which was anti-righting no 
matter what you tried to do or work with, and they

31:23.824 --> 31:37.105
really felt that all whites were their enemies, or 
your friends in the civil rights movement, black

31:23.824 --> 31:37.105
friends, were involving you and making you put 
your butt on the line with them somewhere.

31:45.792 --> 31:57.237
I remember once with a group of blacks, we all went 
skinny dipping and it was done at a time that the

31:58.077 --> 32:25.063
media had been notified that we would be there at 
Hamilton's pool outside of Austin skinny dipping

31:58.077 --> 32:25.063
and it was done so that they would be called in and 
and just show a lot of white girls and black guys

31:58.077 --> 32:25.063
frolicking around having a good time totally nude 
and of course you know that sort of picture that

31:58.077 --> 32:25.063
gets released or I think it was in the campus 
newspaper It just sent shivers down the backs of

32:26.191 --> 32:31.358
parents who envisioned all these mulatto babies. 
But marijuana just helped make it seem just a

32:33.581 --> 32:40.712
little bit more mellow for a moment rather than so 
tense all the time.

32:44.217 --> 32:46.119
Did you regard yourself as a hippie? Hippie was a 
word used by the press and by the parents. No, I

32:51.968 --> 32:53.970
didn't regard myself as a hippie. A hippie was a 
flip word. It was like beatnik. It was a word that

32:59.864 --> 33:08.841
stupid TV shows got a hold of and tried to stick on 
us. Hippie was so flippant. It was like trying to

33:12.228 --> 33:17.578
ridicule or make fun of what we were all about, I 
felt. To say hippie, it made it sound like you were

33:21.533 --> 33:45.404
just some long-haired freak who stayed stoned 
most of the time and had no political or social

33:21.533 --> 33:45.404
conscience, which is, I think, what shows like 
Laugh-In and people like Goldie Hawn sort of

33:21.533 --> 33:45.404
reduced the movement to, at least on the public 
television channels or the public airwaves. It

33:46.345 --> 33:47.667
would be like... Asking someone...

33:54.116 --> 34:00.244
I guess it would be like asking a fundamentalist 
Baptist if he considered himself a holy roller. He

34:01.605 --> 34:03.568
would probably take offense at that term. It's 
just one of those cutesy little titles that gets

34:04.148 --> 34:08.253
stuck on someone. But as far as a hippie, my family 
certainly regarded me as a hippie. They regarded

34:12.839 --> 34:15.562
all of my friends as hippies. But... Hippie was not 
a popular term with the movement itself. It was one

34:24.972 --> 34:29.579
of those media terms that gets stuck on people. 
What did you call yourself? Did you have a word to

34:32.704 --> 34:35.448
describe? No, not really. We just considered 
ourselves involved with the peace movement.

34:42.017 --> 34:46.003
My father would call us peaceniks sometimes.

34:47.047 --> 34:49.231
And that seemed closer than hippie to me.

34:55.401 --> 35:04.155
I just regarded myself as a free thinker and 
somebody who was not going to accept all the

34:55.401 --> 35:04.155
garbage that the government was trying to force 
down my throat. I didn't want to get caught up in

35:04.175 --> 35:05.697
that. But I guess if I really look back on it, I guess 
more than anything, we were anarchists. We were

35:12.207 --> 35:16.151
people who wanted to bring about an overthrow of 
the government. We were people who wanted to bring

35:16.331 --> 35:19.274
about an overthrow of the system. And by system, I 
mean the family system, the way most people

35:19.614 --> 35:27.342
regarded the education system. We wanted 
everything to be run on a whole different basis

35:29.784 --> 35:36.631
that involved no censorship. Everybody could 
just, quote unquote, do their own thing.

35:43.291 --> 35:48.698
How do you feel about the statement that you, along 
with other SDS members, were communist

35:43.291 --> 35:48.698
sympathizers?

35:51.883 --> 35:52.724
I can live with that. To me, calling someone a 
communist is not an insult.

36:00.675 --> 36:03.339
That does not make you a bad person to me. I'm not 
sure what they meant by communist sympathizers.

36:09.227 --> 36:13.112
I'm not even sure that most people who use the word 
communist have any idea of the word as far as a

36:13.598 --> 36:24.329
communist, a pure theoretical look at the 
communist belief that it's a society that works

36:13.598 --> 36:24.329
for the mutual benefits of other people. If they 
want to call me a communist sympathizer, that's

36:24.349 --> 36:28.093
fine with me. I think the word was erroneously used 
to mean a sympathizer or to have some sort of

36:28.194 --> 36:34.240
Russian ties. And I didn't know much about Russia 
at the time. Communal living was a big thing at the

36:41.054 --> 36:43.797
time. I knew several people who did live in 
communes. I had friends in Tennessee that lived on

36:49.244 --> 36:56.073
a commune that still works today called The Farm.

36:57.975 --> 37:05.565
I

36:57.975 --> 37:05.565
had lots of friends out in California and Oregon 
who lived on communes. And the fact that if someone

37:06.006 --> 37:07.888
thought To say that I was a communist sympathizer, 
I knew no more about the communist government and

37:08.459 --> 37:14.105
what was going on over there. And what I did know, it 
seemed to me that it was somewhat of a repressive

37:14.865 --> 37:18.449
government. So I would have never supported that. 
I think they threw that term out because the worst

37:22.092 --> 37:30.220
thing you could be at the time was somebody who 
supported Russian or communism. I mean, the Red

37:30.240 --> 37:35.585
Scare and Joseph McCarthy were still very much 
alive in a lot of people's minds. And... To say that

37:39.037 --> 37:46.667
you were a communist sympathizer meant that you 
were just totally opposed to a democratic way of

37:39.037 --> 37:46.667
life. And that got the conservative side all in an 
uproar because now they could look at anybody with

37:48.310 --> 38:00.766
long hair or faded jeans or people who spoke out 
against the war. They didn't listen to what those

38:01.788 --> 38:04.892
people had to say. because the conservative 
element, the political element, had branded us as

38:05.868 --> 38:12.121
communist sympathizers. So they no longer heard 
the words. They just thought of us as communist,

38:14.226 --> 38:18.074
which was an automatic turn off. It was a clever way 
of branding us. It would effectively make

38:25.072 --> 38:31.198
anything we had to say not worth listening to if the 
people that we were trying to get to thought we were

38:25.072 --> 38:31.198
communists. It would be like if I told you this 
person was a child molester. I mean, are you really

38:39.585 --> 38:47.072
going to listen to them tell you how to bring up your 
children?

38:47.092 --> 38:52.637
What interesting public figures did you meet 
during your years in the SDS? What type of people? I

38:55.987 --> 39:07.023
guess I met some famous people, enough to shake 
hands with them on the podium and be introduced to

38:55.987 --> 39:07.023
them, like Abby Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. I did meet 
Lawrence Forland Getty when he was in Texas.

39:13.332 --> 39:18.600
I heard Timothy Leary speak, but I'd never 
actually met him. I heard...

39:20.662 --> 39:24.508
Oh... various people associated with the Black 
Panther Movement and Malcolm X and the Civil

39:26.125 --> 39:36.962
Rights Movement, you know. But I met Jane Fonda on 
one occasion,

39:37.142 --> 39:49.602
who my father just thought that was horrible, that 
I would even shake her hand. But those people

39:50.071 --> 39:56.237
didn't impress me nearly as much as my college 
professors at the time. One in particular, my

39:58.119 --> 40:07.228
psychology professor, Devendra Singh, who I 
think had a big influence on just how I felt. I mean,

40:07.548 --> 40:12.312
immediately he was so anti-Vietnam War. And he 
introduced me to such a different way of looking at

40:14.094 --> 40:16.957
the world. And he was an Indian. And of course, that 
didn't sit well with my parents either. But we had a

40:27.454 --> 40:33.921
relationship for the year. And I greatly 
respected him and his views. And my English

40:40.188 --> 40:45.013
professor, I was in an experimental English class 
that year. And boy, was it Peter Botsworth. He was

40:49.353 --> 40:55.724
another real popular speaker at the time on the 
University of Texas campus. These people would

40:57.186 --> 41:03.497
invite you into their homes, and you really felt a 
great deal of care and concern from these people.

41:04.278 --> 41:07.243
They were much more important to me than any of the 
big names.

41:13.973 --> 41:20.944
What was your parents' reaction to your behavior 
in college or your involvement with the STFs?

41:23.848 --> 41:27.073
Well, it was not a good time.

41:31.420 --> 41:34.705
My father literally came up to the University of 
Texas one night. He got into Austin about 10

41:35.406 --> 41:39.272
o'clock on a day that they had filmed us in various 
activities on this particular day we had been

41:39.590 --> 42:00.973
protesting the cutting down of trees along barton 
creek and we'd actually chained ourselves to

41:39.590 --> 42:00.973
trees and the bulldozers had come and wouldn't 
chop down the trees and the police with the bull

41:39.590 --> 42:00.973
horns and everything but my father had seen it on 
the six o'clock news and he immediately jumped in

41:39.590 --> 42:00.973
his car and announced to my mother that he was not 
going to support a goddamn commie You know, he'd be

42:01.493 --> 42:15.067
up there in Austin, and he came, and unfortunately 
he came, and my psychology professor Devendra and

42:01.493 --> 42:15.067
I were, we were actually just sitting in the living 
room at the time, but I think we were in various

42:01.493 --> 42:15.067
stages of undress. And my father, who was a little 
man, I mean, he was maybe 5'8", 5'9", and Devendra

42:16.188 --> 42:25.197
was tall. He was 6'1". My father literally threw 
him up against the wall and then pushed him down the

42:27.228 --> 42:33.417
stairs, yelling and screaming the whole time. 
Well,

42:34.018 --> 42:47.899
being Miss Peace Love that I was, I wasn't going to 
call the police, but I did tell my father to leave

42:34.018 --> 42:47.899
and ordered him off, and he threatened to cut me off 
financially, and I told him that was fine with me.

42:48.500 --> 42:50.163
Knowing full well he probably wouldn't do it. 
Things were very strained at this time. My family

42:54.209 --> 42:56.492
did not know... of how much I was involved in SDS. 
And if they had known that I was actually

43:03.777 --> 43:28.318
perpetrating any of the vandalism or the 
disrupting of services on the campus,

43:03.777 --> 43:28.318
they would have had...

43:03.777 --> 43:28.318
Well, I did so many things that I thought they would 
disown me for, but... I think more than anything,

43:28.855 --> 43:42.072
the fact that I dated people that were not of the 
same race

43:28.855 --> 43:42.072
and religion, and or religion, had them floored. 
They just lived in fear that I would take off with

43:42.132 --> 43:48.721
somebody God knows who.

43:51.765 --> 43:52.686
It was very strange. It was very difficult. They 
were very, very unhappy. Totally unsupportive of

43:58.589 --> 44:06.780
any views I

43:58.589 --> 44:06.780
had. They couldn't support them. And even a 
financial cutoff wasn't a big threat because

44:09.343 --> 44:16.753
everything was so anti-materialistic at the 
time.

44:20.597 --> 44:24.883
Student loans were easily available.

44:26.568 --> 44:44.652
You could live very cheaply in Austin, and you 
could live with friends, and I never had to do that,

44:26.568 --> 44:44.652
but I had a number of people stay with me for weeks at 
a time, and that was just considered cool then,

44:26.568 --> 44:44.652
even though sometimes you would get a little 
hacked, but whoever was staying with you wasn't

44:26.568 --> 44:44.652
exactly picking up after him or herself. You would 
never say too much about it. You would probably

44:48.037 --> 44:50.500
just get high and try to forget it.
