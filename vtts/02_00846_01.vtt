WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:06.879
25th, 1975, with interviewer Mike Stevens, at 
home Mrs. C.O. Powell on 409 Barton Street in

00:06.939 --> 00:10.022
Hearn. Is that on there? Yeah, I want that on there 
for a reason, just for my own reference. Now do I

00:16.329 --> 00:17.330
start? Yeah. Why don't you start out, like I said, 
tell us something about your family or whatever.

00:23.216 --> 00:29.363
My grandparents came from Frankfurt, Germany in 
1860. why they chose to come to the United States.

00:34.693 --> 00:37.256
Times was getting hard there. And they came to, let

00:38.758 --> 00:48.973
me see, I think they came to New Orleans. I think 
that, I've heard my mother say that. And she was

00:51.877 --> 00:53.619
born 1863. And then

00:53.679 --> 01:00.008
she and my daddy married And I was born in 
Rutherford County, Tennessee in 18 and 92. How

01:07.731 --> 01:10.334
many was in your family? How many brother and 
sister do you have? With me? Yeah. I had one sister

01:14.678 --> 01:17.541
and two brothers. And my mother died in 19 and 10. 
And I was in college in Murfreesboro, Tennessee at

01:23.168 --> 01:29.995
Teachers College. when my mother died. And then I 
went to college, and then in 19, I went two years. In

01:38.780 --> 01:44.628
19 and 13,

01:38.780 --> 01:44.628
my husband and I married. And we had eight 
children, and we educated all of them.

01:55.564 --> 01:59.610
And then we came in 19,

01:59.911 --> 02:12.230
In 29, Daddy got transferred from the Southern 
Pacific Railroad, I mean, no, no, from the L&N

01:59.911 --> 02:12.230
Railroad to the Southern Pacific Hill. And he 
worked for the Southern Pacific until he died in

02:13.331 --> 02:19.120
1970. And during the War II, I had two boys in the 
service. One of them, he worked for the railroad,

02:28.868 --> 02:32.472
was Navy CB. And the other one had just finished 
high school. And we had to sign for him. My daddy

02:38.400 --> 02:39.120
did. I wouldn't sign for him. And he joined up with 
that bunch from Harris County and Waller County to

02:40.843 --> 02:50.675
take revenge on Pearl Harbor. Go ahead. Go ahead. 
I'm just checking this thing. OK, it's doing fine.

02:58.113 --> 03:07.508
And they sunk that ship at Pearl Harbor and there 
was a thousand left Houston. And so you've been,

03:08.650 --> 03:10.834
how long have you been here in Hearn now? And I have 
been in Hearn off and on ever since 34. Why I say off

03:16.823 --> 03:23.935
and on, if the company, if the railroad wanted to 
send my husband anywhere, Well, we'd just pack up

03:24.522 --> 03:32.990
and go wherever they'd send him, and then when he 
got through that job, we'd come back to Hearn, and

03:24.522 --> 03:32.990
he'd go back to the job here. Who were some of the 
places you went off and on? Oh, my goodness. I've

03:36.474 --> 03:43.541
been up and down the railroad from Sherman to 
Cypress, Texas. We have lived in Sherman. We have

03:47.585 --> 03:49.166
lived in Kaufman. I've lived in Ennis. I've lived 
in Dallas. You've made the rounds, Ann. And

03:57.318 --> 04:00.383
Cypress. And then, of course, here. We've always 
called her. And ever since 34, we've always called

04:04.048 --> 04:07.633
her in our home. Home base. Well, this is where we 
come back to. And then I have my baby boy has three

04:13.262 --> 04:17.929
degrees. He got his BS degree from Sam Houston. And 
then he was principal of a school at Saratoga,

04:22.538 --> 04:27.784
Texas, a year. Where is that? Oh, out here 
somewhere. Oh, it's out from,

04:33.512 --> 04:50.132
well, I know how to get there, but it's between 
Liberty and back towards Humboldt in there. And

04:52.070 --> 04:56.575
then he went back then to Sam Houston and got his 
master degree. And we've just always, Daddy, my

04:58.117 --> 05:04.145
husband, was born in Cook County, Texas. And when 
his mother and daddy, he had two brothers, and they

05:05.346 --> 05:14.257
was great big boys, and they decided they'd go back 
to Tennessee. And Daddy, of course, was big enough

05:15.298 --> 05:19.984
that he had that Texas fever. He always wanted to 
come back to Texas. And of course we've always been

05:23.928 --> 05:33.981
satisfied here because there's so many 
advantages here that we didn't have there.

05:34.943 --> 05:38.547
Understand I am a Tennessee fan. I was born in red 
there. But I've never regretted coming to Texas.

05:44.475 --> 05:47.980
What do you think some of the advantages of living 
here are? A whole lot of the advantages until the

05:48.145 --> 05:54.433
Depression, until this Depression came on, was 
work. There's so many more kinds of work here than

05:55.335 --> 06:01.263
there was back then. You mean there was more work 
here than there was in Tennessee? Yes, because

06:03.966 --> 06:09.233
there was more, you know, different kinds of work. 
And then we was living in Grosbeck when the other

06:09.253 --> 06:16.042
Depression was. Which one are you talking about 
now? You know, the depression, it started in 29,

06:17.795 --> 06:25.765
and it really got bad in 30 and 31. And of course, we 
had plenty to eat and everything because Daddy was

06:27.548 --> 06:34.757
on a salary. But when everybody around you is out of 
work, well, it makes times hard on everybody, just

06:35.158 --> 06:44.289
like it is now. And money was tight. And they talk 
about the Depression then. Well, hard times is

06:50.188 --> 06:54.153
worse now than they were then. You really think so? 
Yes, sir. I think so. And I'll tell you why. There is

06:58.958 --> 07:01.220
so many more people. The population is greater. 
And then there is so many things to do, so many

07:03.483 --> 07:10.851
things that shut down. Way back then, well, there 
wasn't so many factories and all these You take

07:18.173 --> 07:26.522
Deer Park, Lake Jackson, and Lake City, and Texas 
City, and all those. They wasn't on a boom then. And

07:30.226 --> 07:34.671
now, well, the population is so great. And 
everything is so high. Things didn't go out of

07:37.313 --> 07:44.541
proportion in the other depression, but it is in 
this one. You see what makes it. Now, I am on. a

07:47.840 --> 08:09.780
railroad retirement i draw a check and i you can go 
in a grocery store and something's jumped way up

07:47.840 --> 08:09.780
this week well i get my check i don't get any 
increase in my salary it's the same amount it's

07:47.840 --> 08:09.780
just still the same amount but i have got to try to 
meet that high price and i can't do it I cannot do it.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.963
That's a problem for everybody. Everybody. 
That's it. The

08:17.366 --> 08:22.493
claim is now there's just no money. The people's 
got no money. And what little they have got,

08:24.655 --> 08:29.241
they've had to spend it because everything was so 
high. Do you remember anything? Any specific

08:32.288 --> 08:41.002
incident that was really tough on you during the 
Depression that you had to deal with, say, about a

08:32.288 --> 08:41.002
thing being so tight or whatever? Any specific 
thing that you can think of that was really bad?

08:44.328 --> 08:47.353
Well, I can tell you one thing, if this would be 
interesting. My husband worked for the railroad,

08:48.876 --> 08:55.126
and he worked 15 men. And in those days, the company 
furnished your house and had some little houses in

08:57.854 --> 09:03.381
the yard for these men. And he had to figure out that 
15 men that they worked three days a week. Of

09:11.953 --> 09:14.496
course, Daddy drew his salary just the same. But 
these men and one man had a wife and 11 children. 11

09:20.724 --> 09:21.545
kids? 11 kids on three days a week. Talk about a 
thing being tied. And every morning, I'd fix up a

09:26.980 --> 09:39.974
big pan of beans, some kind of dried beans, a big pan 
of meal, and a great big chunk of side meat. Then

09:40.475 --> 09:44.939
meat didn't come wrapped up in little squares like 
it did now. It was just the whole side of a hog. And

09:48.163 --> 09:52.648
I'd send one of my boys out to her house in the yard. I 
done that for over a year. to keep from them

09:56.782 --> 09:59.125
children from going hungry. And that's the way 
they lived. That's a perfect example of what I

10:02.609 --> 10:04.231
wanted. Yeah. And now I look at tuition.

10:14.083 --> 10:25.017
When we took this grandson that I am educating, we 
took him, I brought him from the hospital in a

10:14.083 --> 10:25.017
bassinet. You're talking about John? What are you 
talking about? And then when Karen was five years

10:28.035 --> 10:34.284
old, I took her. Okay, just a second. Let me stop you 
here. Why don't you back up? I mean, I know who

10:37.730 --> 10:42.817
you're talking about, obviously, but go ahead and 
say who you're talking about for the tape. Say who

10:42.877 --> 10:43.819
you're talking about. I'm talking about my 
grandchildren, my two of my grandchildren. Well,

10:48.145 --> 10:51.190
we raised both of them. And if I live till the ninth 
day of May, John will graduate from A&M. Karen has

10:57.833 --> 11:00.937
got one more year in high school. It has been hard 
since the time she's got like the hell. But I am a

11:06.626 --> 11:10.973
great believer in the Lord. I believe if you live 
right and do right, God's going to take care of you.

11:19.773 --> 11:26.482
It may be in a mysterious way, but I think that he's 
going to take care of you. There has been times

11:26.502 --> 11:37.115
since Daddy died that I'd think, well, how in the 
world am I going to do? And about the time when I

11:37.155 --> 11:48.750
would start to worry, which I shouldn't worry, 
because it's a sin to worry about something that's

11:37.155 --> 11:48.750
beyond your control. I'd get a check from some of my 
children. Really? And then that'd solve your

11:53.403 --> 11:55.065
problem, right? And that solves it. I have never 
been hungry for the want of something to eat. I've

12:02.193 --> 12:04.095
always had a way to get about. I've had a good place 
to stay. John and Karen's always had plenty of

12:07.339 --> 12:13.246
clothes to wear. And a way to get about. They've 
never been hungry. And then I don't know whether

12:20.472 --> 12:24.277
we've had hard times or not. Just depending on what 
you consider hard times, I guess. Well, it's been

12:28.543 --> 12:30.306
hard. But God didn't promise me no bed of roses. 
Yeah, that's true. No, that's right. That's the

12:36.194 --> 12:37.055
way it is. But I can tell you what. If you look about, 
you'll always find somebody that's in a worse

12:39.900 --> 12:49.433
shape than you are, financially, health, or 
anything. I have been sick a lot. The 16th of June, I

12:52.464 --> 12:56.288
will be 83 years old. That's pretty old. And I can 
get about. I get out here in my yard. I do every lick

13:02.154 --> 13:03.795
of work. I don't run over nothing. I don't keep 
house anymore like I used to. But people get in and

13:09.080 --> 13:11.182
out. I sing a lot sometimes. And sometimes I get 
ashamed of myself that I think, well, Why do I want

13:18.623 --> 13:20.606
to complain? I've got everything that God has 
promised to give me. And you see children, there's

13:25.692 --> 13:29.918
children in this town that's hungry. And another 
thing, that in the last 20 years, there's been so

13:31.219 --> 13:41.353
much crying, so much going on. When I grew up, Oh, 
me. If you heard of a killing, the neighbors

13:45.983 --> 13:52.372
gathered at one another's house, and that was 
something terrible. And now you pick up the

13:52.392 --> 14:00.103
newspaper, and this one killed that one, and that 
one, and you lay the paper down and don't think

13:52.392 --> 14:00.103
nothing about it. And if there was any dope or 
anything like that, I never heard of it.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.379
Compared to now when it's a typical thing. When 
it's just a typical thing now that... Oh, I think

14:14.648 --> 14:17.193
they're on dope. They must be on dope, just as 
unconcerned if I'd walk in my kitchen and take a

14:17.954 --> 14:23.043
drink of water. Why don't you tell us some of the 
things maybe about, I like what you're talking

14:24.606 --> 14:32.640
about now, how things maybe have changed since the 
time you were a teenager. of them to now. Oh, my

14:35.503 --> 14:36.664
gracious. Just a few things you can think of, maybe 
even a way, you know. Well, starting out, what was

14:41.148 --> 14:44.631
Hearn like when you first came here? What? What was 
Hearn like when you first came here? Well, my baby

14:47.934 --> 14:55.061
girl is 42 years old, and she graduated in Hearn. 
And she thinks it is terrible the way the teenagers

14:56.642 --> 15:02.307
do now and the way she done. They didn't get in no car 
and ride and all over town. And people, everybody,

15:07.666 --> 15:10.028
we had a car. Of course, gas wasn't high. How high 
was it? Well, the best I remember is about 18 or 20

15:14.772 --> 15:19.996
cents a gallon. And that wasn't high for that time? 
Oh, no.

15:25.701 --> 15:33.087
And the first automobile that we bought

15:25.701 --> 15:33.087
was 19 and 15,

15:33.809 --> 15:39.597
I guess. And we give $540 for it. $540 for a car? For a 
car, Ford. Was it a real nice car? Yes, certainly

15:52.415 --> 15:54.097
was nice. $540 compared to now, $4,000. What there 
are now, yeah. And you could buy a set of furniture.

16:04.218 --> 16:06.181
a bedroom suit for $50. Goodness. And when is this 
now? What year are you talking about now? Well,

16:11.647 --> 16:20.799
now, with the furniture, oh, I expect it was about 
19.

16:21.220 --> 16:26.967
Well, 19 and 23, I bought a bedroom suit. I got a 
dresser. They didn't have Chester drawers then.

16:34.467 --> 16:36.148
They called them washstands. And a bed and a 
mattress and a rocking chair for $54. And I guess

16:43.555 --> 16:45.496
I'd grown them maybe then. Maybe I thought that was 
too high. Compared to what it is now. Yeah. Well,

16:51.181 --> 17:00.870
you see, what we got then, when we came to Texas, 
Daddy got 65 a month we had more money then than we

17:01.137 --> 17:30.756
did when he retired in 63 and he was making over 400 
and they kept up our house we didn't have any

17:01.137 --> 17:30.756
expenses on our utilities and telephone bill yeah 
i mean you had more money back yes sir we did we could

17:01.137 --> 17:30.756
i have seen the time when we would buy our groceries 
to last a month. And it would be about $25. For the

17:39.234 --> 17:41.076
whole month? Yes, sir. Maybe we'd have to buy bread 
or something, or maybe milk, some little item. And

17:47.843 --> 17:49.444
now you can't get by $25 a week. I can go to the 
grocery store now and just a few items and be $10 or

17:51.726 --> 17:58.393
$12 and come out swinging the sack. And put it in 
your glove compartment almost. Yes, that's

17:59.874 --> 18:00.895
right. Well, how has Hearn changed from the time 
you came here? Well, the biggest change in Hearn is

18:03.846 --> 18:08.472
the morality. The what? Morality. People has lost 
their honesty and morality. You mean at the heck

18:14.459 --> 18:15.800
when you were here? Yes, sir. When in the 
happenings of today, if it had happened back,

18:17.002 --> 18:30.898
well, I'll say back in 30,

18:17.002 --> 18:30.898
people would have thought it was something 
terrible. You mean like he's killing some things?

18:32.882 --> 18:33.182
Yes. And now it's killings and stealings and 
robbery.

18:39.910 --> 18:40.651
People don't think. If anything back then had 
happened like that it happens now, why, the

18:40.971 --> 18:51.944
families, nobody wouldn't have seen them for a 
year, for they'd have felt so disgraced. And now,

18:51.964 --> 18:54.707
why, they just laugh about it and go on. Can you 
remember any of the older buildings or structures

18:55.749 --> 19:01.155
that were around then that are gone now? You know, 
some of the, maybe a grocery store or something

19:01.777 --> 19:04.241
like this? Oh, my goodness, yes. I think this would 
be kind of interesting.

19:11.972 --> 19:14.716
Well, again, that's the post office. The post 
office used to be on the corner of, that's 4th

19:14.736 --> 19:24.811
Street, isn't it, that runs across the track? 
Well, right there where Gibson was, that's where

19:25.192 --> 19:31.421
old post office used to be. Really? only that was an 
old shackled building like and then they built a

19:31.848 --> 19:58.783
new post office and then on down from the post 
office there on the corner from the post office

19:31.848 --> 19:58.783
coming back towards the Pamela's sister back 
towards his office there was a grocery store there

19:31.848 --> 19:58.783
on the corner Italian had it I've done even forgot 
his name And then there was a shoe shop then, right

19:59.658 --> 20:03.662
next to that grocery store. And then across where 
the First State Bank is, there was about two doors

20:04.684 --> 20:17.137
up, there was the grocery store. All of that is 
gone. That's gone completely now. And where that

20:21.542 --> 20:28.770
Western Auto is, there used to be a coffee shop 
there. And let me see. Where was the? What used to

20:36.454 --> 20:37.416
be? Always nothing hardly that where things is 
now. There's something else. Now the main cafe.

20:49.855 --> 20:51.557
That's been main cafe. A long time in the city cafe. 
Course the main. Well, it hadn't changed hands too

20:59.041 --> 21:10.392
much, but the city cafe has been run by Pammises 
ever since, Lord, I don't know hardly what year.

21:12.754 --> 21:14.415
But it's been a long, long time. It's been in their 
family. Of course, Helen Pammis, her husband, Mr.

21:18.279 --> 21:27.107
Tom, they was the last ones that had it. Bill 
Pammers, his mother and daddy had the City Cafe

21:27.847 --> 21:34.253
first. Then his daddy died, and then she kept it on a 
while, and then Mr. Tom and Helen took it. I'm going

21:45.204 --> 21:50.689
to try to apply this to Brian, too, because 
actually we're supposed to sort of connect it with

21:45.204 --> 21:50.689
Brian if we can. Say back, I don't know, say back in a 
30s or 40s or something like this did you uh do you

21:55.522 --> 22:22.491
know very much about brian or did you go to brian 
very often do you know oh yes we used to go to brian a

21:55.522 --> 22:22.491
lot do you remember anything about it how it's 
changed oh my goodness yes brian has changed they

21:55.522 --> 22:22.491
used to that there was a uh just woods between brian 
until you got the college station i mean just woods

21:55.522 --> 22:22.491
no no no there wasn't nothing there was nothing but 
just just Well, I think there was maybe one or two

22:22.673 --> 22:30.986
houses set way back or something, and it was five 
miles between the space. And now you just drive

22:31.868 --> 22:38.598
along and you see College Station, City Limits 
College Station. All that new building over on

22:38.618 --> 22:47.292
that side where Sears begins, and there, all 
that's been put up there. And Montgomery and Ward

22:47.312 --> 22:49.896
used to have a store I don't remember what street it 
was now. And it burnt. And they built. Do you

22:57.370 --> 22:58.471
remember when this was? No, I don't remember what 
year it was. That's my trouble. I can't remember

23:02.796 --> 23:04.017
the years. I used to could remember the year of 
anything, but now I have to go to my record to even

23:04.318 --> 23:12.707
see when my kids was born. Well, do you remember 
anything in Bryan that used to be there and still

23:14.970 --> 23:19.815
is? You know, something that was around, say, in 
about the 30s and 40s and still maybe been

23:20.048 --> 23:25.192
remodeled or something now. I don't know where it 
would be down unless it'd be something downtown.

23:32.378 --> 23:42.007
And A&M College used to just be agriculture and 
engineering, mechanical engineering. And the

23:42.927 --> 23:46.230
railroad, there used to be trains, of course. We 
had trains then. And they would stop. at A&M at the

23:49.951 --> 23:56.120
depot there, and A&M boys would get on there. And I 
can go, I believe I can now go to the old part of the

23:57.021 --> 24:01.467
college. Where is it? I don't guess I even know 
where it is. Well, the old, I don't know, I have

24:04.272 --> 24:07.977
never asked John. I wonder if they still have 
classes there or anything. Like, you know where

24:11.522 --> 24:14.406
the railroad track runs, don't you? Yeah. Well, 
over on this side, you could see Kyle Field out from

24:15.280 --> 24:23.011
there. And here then, and the agriculture part was 
over here. Is it still that way, still across the

24:26.936 --> 24:29.159
track? Yeah, yeah. I know what you're talking 
about, out by the veterinary medicine. Well, what

24:35.708 --> 24:38.372
now is the College of Veterinary Medicine? Yeah. 
Well, it's still across the track, though, huh?

24:42.217 --> 24:44.140
Well, that was very small. outfit but that was 
separate from over here. How large was A&M back

24:48.718 --> 24:51.121
during those times? Oh my goodness. Did you have 
any idea how many people around or anything? I just

24:56.989 --> 25:14.211
I wish that I could see Milton McNair his boys went 
there and of course now they are their

24:56.989 --> 25:14.211
granddaddies now they graduated from there but I 
just I'd be afraid to say but what did it what did it

24:56.989 --> 25:14.211
look like then what did they uh structure and the 
buildings and things looked like that. Well,

25:16.657 --> 25:22.083
there were concrete buildings over on this side 
and some of them on that side. And those buildings

25:22.704 --> 25:24.646
are still there. And they were gray, kind of rusty 
looking, but everybody was proud of A&M. And then

25:36.138 --> 25:42.865
the way, I think so many times, Sunday evening when 
we carried John, It was right funny. There were so

25:44.518 --> 25:51.105
few cars, they were just beginning to come in, the 
boys and girls coming in from the spring break. And

25:52.287 --> 26:02.219
then there were all the dormitories and 
everything in the world, just one building after

25:52.287 --> 26:02.219
another, and then still a building. I just just go 
ahead and keep talking that's right i'm just

26:06.436 --> 26:33.102
trying to it will be a and m someday and it won't be 
long it'll be one of the biggest colleges there is

26:06.436 --> 26:33.102
yeah i think i heard somewhere it was one about the 
second or third largest growth had been made well

26:06.436 --> 26:33.102
it it will be because the way it's a growing and then 
you see any field you want to get into you can get

26:06.436 --> 26:33.102
into it at a m you don't have to go a little bit here 
and run all kind of And then I believe in less than

26:33.622 --> 26:46.235
five years' time, premed and law anyway, and 
science, that you can go ahead and finish there.

26:46.916 --> 26:49.318
You think they'll have a law and a medical school 
there? Yeah, I sure do. They'll have medicine

26:52.161 --> 26:55.444
before they wear a law, I believe. I don't know. But 
that's just my guess about it. You were talking

26:59.390 --> 27:04.056
about the connection you and your husband and 
family and things they've had with the railroad.

27:04.096 --> 27:09.103
Do you remember anything at, did you ever have 
anything with the Milliken Railroad? With what?

27:10.926 --> 27:14.530
With the railroad and activity down around 
Milliken? No. They had, there'd been lots of

27:18.255 --> 27:29.110
wrecks, bad wrecks, but they had one terrible 
wreck at Cypress one time. uh train got off the

27:29.917 --> 27:59.299
track and uh they uh let me see what was it i don't 
know some kind of chemical and that caught a fire

27:29.917 --> 27:59.299
and one of the engineers burnt to death really was 
that the uh during these times say again about the

27:29.917 --> 27:59.299
30s or maybe even 20 years or so was that the main way 
of traveling by train especially long distance

27:29.917 --> 27:59.299
traveling even if you took if you had You see, 
anybody that worked for the railroad, we rode

27:59.583 --> 28:03.788
passes. You mean free? Yeah. They're families. 
We'd have a family pass. And then, of course, Daddy

28:09.955 --> 28:17.424
always had a separate pass because he'd be called 
to go somewhere, and he had to have that pass right

28:09.955 --> 28:17.424
then. And we'd ride trains. We didn't go anywhere 
in a car, and we've always had a car. But we'd be

28:24.472 --> 28:28.797
foolish to go in a car when there we had a pass to go 
from here to. florida or tennessee or anywhere we

28:29.047 --> 28:50.734
wanted to go there's very many people people road 
trains well there's very many people have cars

28:29.047 --> 28:50.734
though no no why well one thing i think was train 
service people say anywhere they wanted to go and

28:29.047 --> 28:50.734
when cars

28:56.384 --> 29:02.552
Well, it was built kind of like a burgee-like and it 
had... Like a what? Kind of like a burgee. Did you

29:04.375 --> 29:05.216
ever see a burgee? Yeah, I know what you're talking 
about. It had a top like that and that top would let

29:06.278 --> 29:08.841
back. And the report that... I was living in 
Tennessee. I was just a girl. That was about...

29:21.198 --> 29:22.780
I expect that was...

29:26.911 --> 29:31.277
Let's see.

29:31.297 --> 29:33.040
I expect that was about 1900. And then notified 
everywhere. And wasn't too many people had

29:39.449 --> 29:41.612
telephones. Now, my daddy had a farm. He raised 
stock. But still, there was houses all about. And

29:47.860 --> 29:51.325
right close to us was a little post office and a 
country store. And they called that this car was

29:52.066 --> 29:56.833
coming out of Nashville. Tennessee, which was 50 
miles from us, and for everybody to go out on the

29:57.286 --> 30:02.514
pike. They didn't call it highways then. And that 
thing, we seen it coming in horses. Everybody

30:09.044 --> 30:16.475
drove out there in buggies, you know, and horses 
began to rare up and jump and afraid of that thing.

30:16.595 --> 30:17.857
It was just a splutton. You never heard such racket 
as it was making. And it had small tires and, uh, it

30:25.687 --> 30:53.230
had wire wheels wire yeah they were wire you know 
was this a model t or what kind of car was this well it

30:25.687 --> 30:53.230
was a forward i don't know what you called it i guess 
it would have been a model t and when the first

30:25.687 --> 30:53.230
starters on forward cars why we what this little 
town we lived it was uh 19 and 23. and we bought a

30:55.960 --> 31:05.582
brand new model t and it had a self starter you 
didn't have to crank it and we bought
