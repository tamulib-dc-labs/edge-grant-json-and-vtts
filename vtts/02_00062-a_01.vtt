WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:30.173
at 701 gilchrist street just gilchrist in college 
station talking to bud denton now we're going to

00:03.271 --> 00:30.173
stop and see you hope it's working it is the first 
month of the year january the 20th 1999

00:03.271 --> 00:30.173
bud would you tell us for anybody who might listen 
or read to this later give a brief biographical

00:30.693 --> 00:40.603
summary of yourself before you came here as an 
employee. Because we'll do your student days on

00:40.623 --> 00:43.585
another occasion. All right. Well, let's see. My 
first experience was as a graduate student. Well,

00:51.813 --> 00:52.514
but back up. Born where? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought 
you said we'd do that later. Oh, I was born in

00:56.618 --> 00:59.721
Lexington, Kentucky. in 1922. My father was a coal 
mine lawyer at Stearns, Kentucky, Stearns Coal

01:02.530 --> 01:10.881
and Lumber Company until 1927. And he was 
appointed as special assistant to the Attorney

01:11.762 --> 01:18.611
General of the United States in Washington, DC. 
And we moved there. My mother died when I was 10. And

01:25.159 --> 01:29.725
we, my sister and I moved to Cleveland, Tennessee 
to with my mother's parents and I was raised and

01:30.346 --> 01:41.320
went to school there until I completed high school 
and then I came to Texas and enrolled at A&M. And

01:42.942 --> 01:44.364
what year was that? 41. September 41. And then 
you're here for how long before you go? Well we were

01:49.190 --> 01:58.362
on a three semester deal so I completed two full 
years and went on into service and of course deal

01:59.152 --> 02:06.143
then was if you left school, you were immediately 
recalled or called. We were all, I was one of the

02:06.243 --> 02:10.650
first in enlisted reserve in September of 42. And 
it was about a month before I was called active too.

02:17.901 --> 02:20.605
And I spent 38 months in the armed forces. Where? 
Camp Walters, Texas. Camp Blanding, Florida. in

02:27.721 --> 02:32.948
the wonderful peninsula of Italy for 13 months 
combat, yeah. And then you came back civilian life

02:33.669 --> 02:36.233
here? Spring of 46. Now I was married, I should have 
pointed that out, in 1943. So I was married when I

02:42.903 --> 02:49.612
went overseas and then when we came back to school 
we were married couple. And you lived at Dr.

02:50.413 --> 02:55.180
McNew's Garage Park. It was nice. And then, all 
right, you graduate when? Well, I finished in 47

02:59.953 --> 03:10.706
summer, and I was offered a graduate scholarship, 
they called it then. It was $100 a month, taught 12

03:10.726 --> 03:14.491
hours of physical ed. Les Palmer taught 12 hours. 
Another guy taught 12 hours for $70, so for $270.

03:23.088 --> 03:26.431
They got 36 hours of teaching, which I enjoyed. The 
experience was invaluable. And then they

03:29.254 --> 03:33.818
recommended me...

03:35.199 --> 03:38.543
I had a summer job in the Veterans Testing Service. 
We were located first in the old George McCullough

03:39.103 --> 03:47.671
Confectionary Building, then they moved us to 
Bazell. And we tested veterans and non-students,

03:52.467 --> 03:53.949
I just stayed with it. Alright, you tested them for 
what? Well, just occupational orientation, job

03:55.831 --> 04:01.018
opportunities. Veterans had to be tested. 
Alright, this was testing as they were beginning

04:03.001 --> 04:07.446
their studies? Or if they wanted to change majors 
to college students. So this was to help them

04:12.153 --> 04:16.018
select a major and a professional? Right. And then 
we did a lot of work with skilled and semi-skilled.

04:20.665 --> 04:26.191
So can you give any examples of where the tests 
obviously succeeded or didn't succeed? Well, I

04:26.251 --> 04:31.857
can from high school, but it's difficult. Well, 
college, yeah. Jack Raines and some of those

04:33.259 --> 04:39.245
students that we had at the adjunct later. That's 
Jack Raines, the Houston lawyer politician.

04:46.028 --> 04:46.949
Entrepreneur. Entrepreneur. Stadium builder. 
But anyway, that was the main jest. And then we had

04:54.400 --> 05:09.923
absorption of the Veterans Testing Service, and 
it was started, I guess, in 49 or 50, the basic

04:54.400 --> 05:09.923
division, which was a general studies college, 
which put us so far ahead. Of course, Austin has a

05:10.604 --> 05:13.909
better background on that than I. I was integrated 
into it. But describe that basic studies. Well,

05:21.468 --> 05:30.362
all entering freshmen who came to A&M in those days 
were assigned and tested. We gave a battery of

05:30.422 --> 05:41.500
about seven tests, placement tests we called, and 
talked with the students on the level of English,

05:30.422 --> 05:41.500
the level of math. and staying out of chemistry, 
you know, that sort of thing. We offered courses

05:49.154 --> 05:56.263
in, now we call it personal development, that's 
study habits. And that meant that all those

05:57.565 --> 06:10.862
students were, study habits, personal 
development, or basic psychology, which they

05:57.565 --> 06:10.862
still have at A&M, and the occupation study. And 
then we had a real high-powered one called Basic

06:11.821 --> 06:19.769
106, which was an orientation to major fields of 
study. And we had visiting teachers from biology,

06:19.789 --> 06:25.014
chemistry, and so forth. Describe some of the 
variety of the talents, or lack thereof, that you

06:25.074 --> 06:32.100
all encountered. Well, of course, the admission 
requirements at A&M, then, we all always, I think

06:32.140 --> 06:41.389
there are were more difficult then than they may be 
now. But the test cutting scores were not in the

06:45.171 --> 06:48.514
vote. The A.C.E. and S.A.T. later were tests that 
were just given and we used those in terms of

06:53.520 --> 07:07.495
placement with English achievement and science 
and math achievement and interest tests. There

07:07.778 --> 07:12.542
must have been some of the students who came from 
small high schools that were very different from

07:07.778 --> 07:12.542
those in the big. Yeah, a lot of schools in those 
days offered alternate. For instance, you took

07:16.926 --> 07:25.534
plane geometry this year, algebra two the 
following year, and if you were out of sequence.

07:25.554 --> 07:29.778
And, of course, A&M had this deal of two algebras, 
one plane geometry. And I know when working with

07:30.719 --> 07:36.064
athletes later on, athletes later on, We had a lot 
of battles with the registrar back then. Even the

07:41.703 --> 07:48.077
math people said, well, what do you need plain 
geometry for?

07:48.257 --> 07:52.787
And what were the most popular majors then? Well, 
it was general curriculum, really. A lot of kids

07:56.064 --> 08:04.495
could play two full years and not lose credit, 
unless it was something like architecture. But I

08:04.855 --> 08:07.719
did it with athletes later. In helping them select 
their courses, he could have a biology course. And

08:17.118 --> 08:29.494
Cliff Ranstall would let them take engineering 
graphics, for instance, or that ME 101, you

08:17.118 --> 08:29.494
remember, that was just kind of a slide rule 
course, and see how they fell with it. Of course, we

08:29.514 --> 08:34.721
had superb teachers, Medlin and Dobson and all 
those folks over in biology. Math was still a...

08:36.103 --> 08:40.249
Let's digress on that. Okay. Describe some of the 
great teachers that you remember. Well, I had a

08:45.181 --> 08:48.324
bunch as a student. Names and what they taught and 
so forth. Now, from a personal standpoint?

08:55.470 --> 08:55.710
Either. Well, from a personal standpoint, 
Harrison Hurth. In fact, my family, Alice had

08:59.273 --> 09:03.837
Harrison Hurth for a course. Leslie had him for two 
courses, and I had him for a course. You know that we

09:07.881 --> 09:12.085
know the Hurths quite well, but let's make believe 
that I didn't. What was, what? Low key. low key, but

09:15.387 --> 09:16.989
what did he do well? But I was older, you have to 
realize. I took his course, it was technical

09:19.932 --> 09:24.696
writing in the summer. And there were a lot of 
veterans in there, and there were a lot of the

09:24.716 --> 09:29.742
younger kids too. And Harrison had, this guy kept 
turning up with A's. And I think it happened about

09:36.749 --> 09:45.057
one time, and of course he is so perceptive, I guess 
he must have felt, there ain't no way. And so he had

09:45.661 --> 09:51.247
us start riding in class.

09:51.508 --> 09:56.373
Of course, personally, he was a neighbor on top of 
that. Now, I understand his nickname was Happy

09:56.393 --> 09:59.697
Harry. I never heard that. Oh, really? No. 
Somebody told me that was his. And what I know about

10:03.802 --> 10:08.607
him, that fits, because he always seems upbeat. 
And then I had old Carl Elmquist.

10:13.653 --> 10:14.414
What did he teach? He taught. advanced English, 
Shakespeare, and English Lit. We knew how the

10:21.158 --> 10:26.203
six-day bicycle races were in Chicago. He hardly 
ever taught us much. He was a nice guy. What about

10:32.811 --> 10:33.852
some of the others? Well, of course, down in PE, I 
had Seacrest and Colonel Anderson. Now, you talk

10:42.041 --> 10:44.203
about a demanding teacher. give examples. He was 
talking to us one time in his track course about

10:46.791 --> 11:09.280
preparation and of course he he just believed that 
the way to prepare just do it over and over and over

10:46.791 --> 11:09.280
and over and he got to the pole vault when he was 
going through each of the field events and he said

10:46.791 --> 11:09.280
the best way to train for the pole vault you 
remember those dang things I'd like to have seen

11:10.070 --> 11:16.939
some of the kids from that period using the 
equipment today. They said, you just have that

11:16.959 --> 11:29.855
youngster take that pole and run around that 440 
track, not full speed, but just carrying that pole

11:16.959 --> 11:29.855
so he can get accustomed to it. And old Landis 
taught a basketball course. And Dr. Landis had

11:33.579 --> 11:38.085
just come, it was his first semester to teach here, 
And he was a great believer in intramural

11:39.078 --> 11:42.263
athletics. Here, these are all athletes and PE 
majors. We're doing basketball. He said, when in

11:49.333 --> 11:55.562
doubt, hook pass, if you ever put that spin. Of 
course, he'd get up there and demonstrate it. We

11:57.545 --> 12:06.638
were down in the bowels of the Ware Field House, if 
you remember that weird place over there by the

11:57.545 --> 12:06.638
intramural office.

12:10.280 --> 12:15.006
And I had Dr. Summey, I thought was a classic 
installer. We had a bunch of athletes in there, and

12:16.428 --> 12:20.232
boy, they did extremely well. In fact, it was Dean 
Bolton, it was Brooks. Dean Brooks called a bunch

12:25.839 --> 12:36.312
of guys in, athletes that he'd known before 
service, and complimented them on their grades.

12:36.332 --> 12:40.017
He said, I just didn't believe you guys could do 
that well. Right. Keep going on faculty. Well,

12:45.989 --> 12:46.570
let's see. I was always particularly fond of, in 
counseling students, to know courses where

12:47.851 --> 13:00.703
students had difficulty. You know, Kreiss, do you 
remember? Dr. Kreiss. He just recently retired, I

13:06.068 --> 13:08.350
guess. taught that biology 115. I felt like as I got 
to public schools, if you place a teacher where

13:11.796 --> 13:21.045
they're comfortable, they'll do a better job. And 
I felt like a lot of times that some of those profs

13:21.406 --> 13:32.617
wound up teaching courses that they really were 
disinterested in.

13:32.637 --> 13:37.662
I don't say they took it out on students, but their 
performance was not good. Let's see,

13:38.772 --> 13:43.479
math. Well, I was a real scholar when it came to 
algebra. When I entered A&M at 41, you had a choice

13:48.227 --> 13:52.954
of the 102 or 101. So I took 102, and I'd had a high 
school coach taught the advanced algebra in high

13:53.154 --> 14:04.071
school. And we didn't work on stated problems, if 
you can imagine. And the first major test, I went in

14:10.503 --> 14:19.919
there and we had five questions, four of them 
stated problems. And so I was advised that I needed

14:19.939 --> 14:26.389
to move back down to 101, which I don't regret.

14:28.573 --> 14:30.396
Class sizes in that era. Well, I'm going to guess, I 
would say 30 or under, most of them, English,

14:31.912 --> 14:40.943
mathematics. Science was the larger one. They had 
just, I guess they'd always had the large lecture

14:42.385 --> 14:50.455
room, but I would guess maybe 100. My largest 
class, as I recall, was geology and chemistry. As

14:59.620 --> 15:19.518
you look back on those days when you were a young 
faculty member, what was the faculty doing here,

14:59.620 --> 15:19.518
the academic program, that in hindsight was very 
positive, strong, good? You said teaching. How

15:21.280 --> 15:27.605
was that encouraged, that good teaching? Well, 
it's hard to say because I As I got to know the profs,

15:29.506 --> 15:47.946
and Alice and I lived right in the middle of them as 
regular students and played softball league, and

15:29.506 --> 15:47.946
I had worked at a swimming pool, so I knew all the 
children. It was the fact that they were just, that

15:48.427 --> 15:53.472
was their thing, you know. They came here from 
Mississippi State, Mississippi, and I guess

15:54.346 --> 16:02.558
Alabama, and then probably some through the 
Midwest. And they just were dedicated people. And

16:07.666 --> 16:09.689
they didn't pay them anything, I don't think. Who 
lived on the, which faculty lived on the campus?

16:14.156 --> 16:17.080
Well, when I was here as a student, Mary Eccles 
could tell you because she was talking about that.

16:19.773 --> 16:23.016
Was it just the senior faculty, the old-timers? 
That I couldn't tell you. I know later on when, you

16:26.060 --> 16:36.992
know, in the early 50s, I guess they started 
clearing out that back for the MSC. I don't know

16:38.133 --> 16:40.476
whether that was it or not. They had that row of 
faculty houses there. It came this way and then

16:43.339 --> 16:46.763
went down toward where the vice president, I guess 
now, or dean, a man, whoever, that little house.

16:52.345 --> 16:52.565
Yeah. All right. The counseling program. It was 
done when I was a student. Well, but when you were a

17:01.339 --> 17:05.746
young faculty member. Well, that's where I 
started. If I'm a student and I want advice, where

17:07.869 --> 17:10.793
did I go? Oh, to your faculty. To your teacher. Oh, 
yeah. course I was fortunate because teaching

17:17.185 --> 17:41.792
down there as a graduate student in physical ed and 
then later on in the counseling center I made

17:17.185 --> 17:41.792
rounds just like I did in athletics talking to 
teachers just get my impression of them and you

17:17.185 --> 17:41.792
know in those days you could kind of help a kid go 
over to a course where He might not have what I'd

17:43.342 --> 17:48.747
call the basic skills, but he was a good listener. 
And you teach him a few gimmicks on taking notes and

17:48.767 --> 17:57.014
things like that. Who were supposedly, there must 
have been some teachers that were supposedly

17:57.034 --> 18:07.243
easier to get a grade from. Well, I couldn't say. 
Weren't there any myths about, didn't I hear about

18:08.024 --> 18:12.227
Dr. Dan the grade point man? Oh, yeah. but don't let 
that fool you.

18:17.683 --> 18:24.538
Dan Russell and Dan Davis both had that 
reputation.

18:24.558 --> 18:27.945
And then the hardest teacher I ever had, and of 
course I was I was really misplaced because I took a

18:28.364 --> 18:32.951
geography course under old Doc Schlesser. Was he 
here with me? And he got on this latitude and

18:36.076 --> 18:46.271
longitude, and here are all these Air Force guys, 
you know, and here are two or three of us infantry

18:36.076 --> 18:46.271
guys. We had a compass. That was about it. But I tell 
you what, he could get you to do better. And of

18:58.234 --> 19:02.480
course he lived across the street too. Alright, 
you're in the basic division, is that right? Yeah.

19:07.407 --> 19:12.855
And about how many people were in the... College, 
basic college? Yeah. All the freshmen. And

19:15.719 --> 19:20.646
sophomores and a few juniors up to a 30-30. 30 hours 
pass, 30 hours grade. They didn't get out of there

19:24.076 --> 19:31.447
with less than a C. So all freshmen started out in 
the basic division. They could indicate their

19:31.467 --> 19:33.430
major. They were still, we had, when we first 
started, I think we had four counselors. And then

19:40.921 --> 19:49.354
it kind of got bigger and bigger, and Les Palmer and 
Jack Dobson would come over part-time and help.

19:49.374 --> 19:50.616
You mentioned counselors, so If I'm a student and I 
needed some academic advice, I could go to one of

19:50.832 --> 19:55.858
those. You came in the front just like you would in a 
doctor's office. They took them. If you had a

20:00.444 --> 20:02.827
preference, you might have to wait. I was backed by 
the back door, and those kids would come into my

20:03.808 --> 20:09.955
office through the back door. Who were those four? 
Do you remember? Those four counselors? Yeah,

20:16.783 --> 20:18.966
Kingston and... Al Kingston went to Georgia 
State.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.962
Bob Jacobs.

20:32.425 --> 20:33.886
I think Cliff was there. Cliff Ransel. Yeah. I 
can't be sure. He might come later. Then we picked

20:40.933 --> 20:44.376
up a guy named Perry. He was a reading specialist 
and he was kind of a funny little man. He taught you

20:51.818 --> 20:57.865
to read by legal size. Hand that out. And, of 
course, then he brought in another young man who

21:00.208 --> 21:06.195
was really superb and reserved. So we did a lot. In 
fact, I made a presentation one time, and Kingston

21:07.477 --> 21:16.688
told me, he said, if you're going to do this, you 
better have a 1,500 sample. And, of course, we were

21:17.529 --> 21:21.133
fortunate because we had all the reading people 
there. Now, administratively, who was in charge

21:21.738 --> 21:27.783
of the basic division? John Bertram. John 
Bertram. Retired naval. Well, he may have been a

21:31.306 --> 21:34.549
reserve naval officer. Of course, he was a shy, 
retiring guy.

21:40.895 --> 21:50.563
I know the guy was first class, but he kind of gave me 
the impression he was running that like he might

21:40.895 --> 21:50.563
when he was aboard ships. You can try that on 
Austin, because he knew him better than I did. He

21:56.664 --> 21:59.507
left, and then we got Bob Com. Com? Yeah, he went to 
Oklahoma State. K-A-H-M? No, K-A-M-M. M-M,

22:06.496 --> 22:10.000
that's right. He was a class guy, and he knew 
guidance. John was, you know, he was an old ag guy,

22:13.905 --> 22:19.892
but not that that's... Right. Describe in the 
early 50s who was president.

22:29.077 --> 22:31.984
Was Mr. Gilchrist still? I'm not sure when 
Gilchrist left. Tom Harrington. Must have been

22:37.118 --> 22:44.787
president because he hired me for the graduate 
deal and hired me full time for Ed Syke. Tell me

22:46.028 --> 22:50.813
about, make believe I didn't know anything about 
Tom Harrington and his personality and his

22:46.028 --> 22:50.813
talents. Tell me about it. Tremendous person. 
Chemistry teacher. I was never fortunate enough

22:56.059 --> 23:00.524
because I was a liberal arts student. But I never 
heard anybody criticize him. Ever. You know, we

23:04.569 --> 23:05.590
used to kid Later on, you know, you got to know him 
better. They were always joking about some of the

23:09.190 --> 23:19.020
athletes' personnel folders, their grades and 
everything kind of disappeared in the back of his

23:09.190 --> 23:19.020
desk. You know, you kind of have to be careful 
because of Biz Harrington still. But he was really

23:24.446 --> 23:26.709
a class man. He'd call you every once in a while and 
ask you how you're getting along. I appreciate

23:31.794 --> 23:32.996
that. What kind of personality? Outgoing, 
really.

23:39.885 --> 23:41.186
I laughed. John Hall talked to the Lions Club. I 
wish I invited you to go. But he was talking about

23:45.772 --> 23:47.594
Pinky Downs. And he is one of my most fond memories. 
You could walk across the campus and he always

23:52.821 --> 23:57.126
stopped. Asked me how you doing. A little 
chit-chat. Maybe about athletics or something.

24:01.191 --> 24:01.632
And he'd say, turned to go and he said, Bud, keep up 
the good work. And I just, that just made your day.

24:08.895 --> 24:12.259
You know, official greeter. Was Dr. Harrington, 
did you think of him in the early 50s as the key

24:12.279 --> 24:22.891
academic decision maker? Well, see there again, 
why I said that on the phone, I was more or less

24:25.534 --> 24:32.142
removed from it because In the early jobs, in my 
early job as the director of that guidance

24:32.678 --> 24:49.792
service, I was responsible for the department 
head of education and psychology. There were

24:49.812 --> 24:52.715
three people in there, and I was the fourth. You're 
saying education and psychology was three

24:53.516 --> 24:55.677
people? Yeah. The department. And then the next 
step up would be Dr. Harrington, who was liberal

25:02.716 --> 25:05.080
arts then. And by this point, the World War II 
veterans are pretty well gone, early 50s. The

25:14.715 --> 25:21.365
enrollment comes back down to a more reasonable 
number. It was a nice, I think you could walk across

25:23.369 --> 25:30.580
the campus and you knew most of the, I did, most of 
the problems. My dad had a terrible memory. We'd be

25:35.234 --> 25:40.739
walking down the street in Dallas and he'd see 
somebody and he'd recognize them. And he'd say,

25:40.759 --> 25:43.242
Mr. what's your name? I'd like for you to meet my 
son. And of course, going through this core stuff,

25:45.084 --> 25:52.931
you kind of get a little more orientation. OK. Were 
there any changes in the way the basic division

25:55.934 --> 26:00.499
operated during these years? No there was a lot of 
competition from the deans because they weren't

26:02.980 --> 26:22.872
they didn't have the Austin can give you the 
nitty-gritty but that they didn't have majors

26:02.980 --> 26:22.872
that they could count on and Potts was the toughest 
and of course he and Heaton must have been blood

26:02.980 --> 26:22.872
brothers. All right tell me about R.C. Potts. I 
liked him personally, but I didn't ever agree with

26:26.737 --> 26:29.440
him. What was his task? Well, he was dean of 
agriculture. Associate dean. Associate dean.

26:35.246 --> 26:35.987
Yeah, that's right. I'm sorry. And so he was the 
chief agriculture student advisor? Yeah. But

26:45.878 --> 26:52.305
this was when they got to the School of Agriculture 
with 30 hours and 30 grade points. Well, they could

26:52.825 --> 26:55.307
have 30 hours and 40 really. It didn't matter, but 
they had to have that base. And I guess when Mr.

27:02.034 --> 27:09.902
Rudder came, he kind of, Kutash used to always tell 
Rand to get over there and tell him what we're

27:02.034 --> 27:09.902
doing. And this never happened. Of course, I guess 
eventually, I guess prior to that, Mr. Rudder had

27:17.229 --> 27:21.052
asked about that study for military. Right now, so 
that POTS and agriculture, who were the...

27:23.352 --> 27:28.637
Business was Dan Lowe, the associate. Did the 
contact with us too. We never had any difficulty

27:31.260 --> 27:35.003
except... Engineering. Was. Cliff Ransom. Cliff 
Ransom. Until he came to us. I don't remember when

27:41.710 --> 27:46.895
he... Was Kutash for all of arts and science or just 
business? Dan Lowe. Dan Lowe? Was he all of...

27:50.579 --> 27:52.060
Business. all all but just business right who did 
the rest of arts and sciences

27:52.630 --> 28:19.701
Schlesselman yeah and then later Charles okay 
what were what were the tough courses that okay and

27:52.630 --> 28:19.701
history and history you know that you might turn 
that off I made a study one you're you're talking

27:52.630 --> 28:19.701
about the kinds of students and advising them and 
how to get them going in the right direction.

28:27.136 --> 28:28.217
Describe that, please. Well, we were fortunate in 
those days to have a lot of psychological testing

28:29.459 --> 28:40.170
to guide us, plus the high school record. And you 
can tell a lot from that. I found out later on with

28:41.792 --> 28:47.798
athletes that if you see a consistency up or a 
consistency straight across, or a dipping down of

28:48.588 --> 28:57.998
grades and performance in individual subjects. 
And you can utilize that to help students select

28:59.259 --> 29:04.525
courses that they're going to feel comfortable. 
It may be a biology course. It may be a history

29:07.428 --> 29:09.590
course. And when you're talking to a student, you 
have to be aware of this type of thing. We didn't

29:16.280 --> 29:31.636
talk much about religion, but some youngsters 
brought it up themselves and where you see a

29:16.280 --> 29:31.636
discipline through their churches or religious 
background, their family, and their school.

29:31.977 --> 29:35.741
You've got three criteria that I thought. And we 
found this working in the early years with

29:35.761 --> 29:46.152
opportunity award candidates because we had to 
interview each one individually before. before

29:46.992 --> 29:48.774
we made a recommendation. About how many of those 
per year were awarded? I'm going to guess 40 or 50

29:51.737 --> 29:55.061
maybe, for the whole school. Yeah, you'd 
interview about how many? Oh, I'd interview 50

29:57.784 --> 30:01.448
myself at least. Three

30:01.588 --> 30:06.654
or four times as many as could be awarded? Oh, yeah. 
And by and large... And it was financial. That was

30:12.681 --> 30:15.784
the base criteria.

30:17.300 --> 30:32.863
And it's hard to say, how do you determine, you 
know, you've got three children and you've got one

30:17.300 --> 30:32.863
parent working, you know, and it's not in a job that 
you really make a whole lot of money. Can you recall

30:32.883 --> 30:38.791
any of those Opportunity Award winners that you 
now are proud to single out? Oh yeah, one is, I guess

30:39.112 --> 30:44.860
he's retired by now, it's Carlton Hazelwood. In 
fact, later on, as he came through pre-med, three

30:45.886 --> 30:56.756
of us wrote letters of recommendation all over the 
United States, and he couldn't get in medical

30:45.886 --> 30:56.756
school. So he went on and got an advanced degree. I 
can't remember. It was a real specialty. He wound

31:04.202 --> 31:06.384
up teaching down at Texas Medical. So, you know, 
you can't use it. I guess his highest test was a 4% or

31:09.967 --> 31:14.391
5%. but he had straight A's. Any others you 
remember Opportunity Award winners? Well, no.

31:22.016 --> 31:26.762
He's the only one, you know, they don't compute. 
Because I have the impression that Opportunity

31:28.685 --> 31:39.521
Award winners have become among the most loyal, 
generous, grateful Aggies. Which...
