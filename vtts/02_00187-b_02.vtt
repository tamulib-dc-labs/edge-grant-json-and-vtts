WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:13.841
He used to come into my class that were sort of cheerleaders for the baseball team in those real shorts.

00:15.783 --> 00:25.377
And I made a remark one day to them.

00:25.437 --> 00:29.903
I wish they wouldn't come in late to class.

00:31.672 --> 00:34.635
and disturb all the men in the class.

00:35.576 --> 00:42.883
And after class, one young lady come up to me and said, you don't want to do that.

00:44.005 --> 00:49.210
You want to let them do that because these young fellows here have to have some excitement.

00:54.095 --> 00:54.776
No, no.

00:55.616 --> 00:59.080
I've heard of problems with

01:00.477 --> 01:04.101
the matter of women attending this, becoming a co-ed.

01:04.121 --> 01:12.150
Because I had one young lady that—see, it happened about 65 or so, I guess.

01:12.250 --> 01:13.892
I'm not sure the exact date.

01:14.633 --> 01:16.214
But she lasted two years.

01:18.016 --> 01:19.398
Just couldn't take it anymore.

01:20.419 --> 01:23.683
And this was mainly not fellow students.

01:24.123 --> 01:25.725
It was the profs.

01:27.443 --> 01:29.566
Yeah.

01:29.667 --> 01:31.710
Now, my jokes never had to change.

01:32.451 --> 01:34.815
But some people's jokes had to change.

01:34.835 --> 01:35.156
Oh, I hear you.

01:35.176 --> 01:36.297
They're going from bail.

01:37.700 --> 01:38.261
Mm-hmm.

01:40.224 --> 01:48.958
Do, in general, the faculty that you knew best, how did they react to the admission of women?

01:50.100 --> 01:51.362
They thought it was a good idea.

01:53.365 --> 01:54.447
I did, too, because...

01:55.777 --> 02:02.865
turned out most of the women that were admitted to this university were sharper and smarter than the men.

02:03.826 --> 02:04.026
All right.

02:04.046 --> 02:06.989
What about the faculty reaction to Voluntary Corps?

02:09.832 --> 02:17.781
Well, I was having Voluntary Corps from the very beginning.

02:18.943 --> 02:25.750
What did you— You see, I'm—even though I served during World War II, I'm sort of anti—

02:26.725 --> 02:34.996
One, I don't like saluting people because that shows that I'm subservient to them.

02:35.997 --> 02:43.627
And I don't think an American is subservient to any other American.

02:44.889 --> 02:49.695
What did your colleagues in general think about Voluntary Corps?

02:50.587 --> 02:54.412
Well, in our department, I think they all were for it.

02:55.013 --> 02:56.715
And integration, racial integration.

02:56.995 --> 02:59.719
For that too, so.

02:59.899 --> 03:02.762
Higher admission requirements, which began in the 60s.

03:04.024 --> 03:09.751
Well, I've sort of been reluctant on that for this reason.

03:09.771 --> 03:18.923
When I went to Washington State University at Land Grant College, you had

03:21.215 --> 03:34.330
the right to be admitted to that land-grant college if you were a graduate of any high school in the state, so you could be admitted to it.

03:35.010 --> 03:38.454
When I came to A&M, the admission was essentially the same.

03:40.336 --> 03:46.243
And so now it's even getting tough for

03:46.527 --> 03:55.076
and Aggie to have his son or daughter admitted to this school where he wants them to go, and I... All right, let me be the devil's advocate.

03:55.656 --> 04:02.704
How large could we allow the enrollment to become and this still be a pleasant campus?

04:04.005 --> 04:05.426
Well, let's put it this way.

04:08.049 --> 04:12.754
When I was here, when we had 4,000 students,

04:14.354 --> 04:20.986
I can know more faculty than I know now, and the faculty has increased.

04:21.006 --> 04:27.117
Yes, I know the people in my department, and some other departments we work closely with.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.766
So, no, we're too large now.

04:31.886 --> 04:32.627
That's what I think.

04:34.190 --> 04:38.117
But I don't see how you can—well,

04:39.886 --> 04:45.592
I've just been reading lately that the University of Texas is raising their admission requirements, too.

04:47.034 --> 04:55.123
And, of course, we got a big influx higher than usual for this spring semester, so we're probably going to have to raise it again.

04:56.384 --> 05:08.678
But I do, one of the problems that I see now is that when I came here, the

05:10.092 --> 05:16.943
finances in this state depended mainly on the oil severance tax.

05:21.029 --> 05:31.105
And the schools, public schools, were almost supported 100 percent except for the bond issues to build buildings.

05:31.861 --> 05:33.303
Now, that isn't true.

05:34.064 --> 05:38.450
You've got to have a school tax in order to make things work.

05:39.952 --> 05:48.284
You also had a state-supported institution in Texas A&M.

05:49.385 --> 06:00.501
And unfortunately, the administration, when I came here, was always proud to mention that they didn't use all their money and return some to

06:00.818 --> 06:02.541
the state.

06:03.823 --> 06:24.480
Nowadays, being a state-assisted university, I don't know—well, maybe the state provides forty to fifty percent of the funds needed to operate this place, but it isn't the same.

06:27.211 --> 06:35.081
All right, there was very great changes made under Mr. Rutter in the 60s, and then he dies.

06:35.141 --> 06:42.309
Do you remember how you and your colleagues felt when you heard the news that he was ill and then he died?

06:42.369 --> 06:49.618
Well, it was pretty much of a shock to me, because I didn't expect him to die.

06:50.019 --> 06:54.484
If you can go through a landing in D-Day and go up a cliff,

06:54.835 --> 07:01.961
and lead a group of people and not get shot.

07:02.182 --> 07:04.223
Then he's followed by Jack Williams.

07:04.984 --> 07:09.048
Do you remember how you all reacted to him?

07:09.148 --> 07:12.250
Do you remember when you first saw him or heard him?

07:15.273 --> 07:24.201
Well, he once made a comment to me that he wished he could spend his time running the university.

07:24.805 --> 07:28.009
instead of doing errands for people on the Board of Regents.

07:30.552 --> 07:35.459
Did he give you an example of the kind of errands that they asked him to do?

07:35.479 --> 07:42.427
Well, football tickets were one of them.

07:44.510 --> 07:48.235
What kind of personality did you think Dr. Williams had?

07:49.797 --> 07:54.002
Well, he had a very good one, one that you

07:54.623 --> 08:00.710
In other words, you thought he was your friend when you first met him.

08:02.632 --> 08:03.933
I agree with you entirely.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.539
Now, Rudder still had some of the military with him.

08:08.579 --> 08:12.083
He adjusted to the way university would run.

08:12.843 --> 08:16.327
Eisenhower never adjusted to running Columbia University.

08:17.809 --> 08:23.095
In other words, he thought you could order things down from the top.

08:24.087 --> 08:27.550
Did Dr. Williams seem to understand Texas A&M?

08:29.332 --> 08:30.633
Did you all think he did?

08:32.775 --> 08:39.521
Well, I don't think he really understood why we have a Corps of Cadets.

08:43.985 --> 08:45.467
Of course, that's tradition.

08:46.207 --> 08:53.554
And that may be the only unique thing that saves this university, because I don't think we're ever going to make a top 10.

08:55.660 --> 09:04.214
One, we don't have the assets to do it, and you've got to change the attitude of the faculty.

09:06.437 --> 09:08.881
Did we make progress under Williams, you think?

09:09.322 --> 09:10.564
Yeah.

09:10.584 --> 09:14.530
Now, when did you all add the doctoral program in geology?

09:21.243 --> 09:21.984
Back in the 60s?

09:22.004 --> 09:24.226
Yeah, it must have been back then.

09:24.246 --> 09:29.390
Do you remember any fight over it or hassle?

09:29.430 --> 09:30.712
Was there any problem?

09:30.732 --> 09:33.974
No, you didn't even have to go to a coordinating board in those days.

09:34.675 --> 09:40.540
Fact is, I don't even know that we had to have permission from anybody in the administration to do it.

09:41.621 --> 09:42.782
You could just go ahead and do it.

09:43.163 --> 09:48.988
How did the department change, if at all, when it moved to the College of Geosciences?

09:51.922 --> 09:54.587
Well, I thought the change was going to be beneficial.

09:55.228 --> 10:03.643
I think the geology department was certainly better off in the college of engineering.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.386
You're saying in hindsight it was?

10:06.448 --> 10:09.052
Yeah, in hindsight.

10:09.453 --> 10:16.866
We were all for it because this gives essentially all the earth sciences together in one group.

10:21.301 --> 10:29.814
And I still remember M. King Hubbard coming here to be interviewed for the dean.

10:31.857 --> 10:34.461
Where was he from?

10:34.481 --> 10:35.642
Oh, he was with the U.S.

10:35.662 --> 10:37.345
Geological Survey at that time.

10:38.206 --> 10:40.069
But see, M. King is

10:43.087 --> 10:52.185
He's a blunt speaking person and a very good researcher.

10:55.675 --> 11:03.787
Of course, one of the first questions he asked me is, how come you aren't the director of the Water Resources Institute?

11:03.807 --> 11:06.170
And I says, because it's over in agriculture.

11:07.012 --> 11:08.995
He says, oh, well, that's not good.

11:10.076 --> 11:18.068
And then, of course, he was for doing away with the Corps entirely.

11:18.088 --> 11:24.197
So if you make that one of the conditions for coming, you're not going to—

11:24.869 --> 11:25.330
come here.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.473
I don't know that he wanted to come anyway.

11:29.135 --> 11:30.577
Is that when they hired Byers?

11:30.978 --> 11:32.680
Yeah.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.883
Describe Dr. Byers as the dean.

11:36.425 --> 11:45.218
Well, I already described him as the vice president, where he said he could get it done in a half a day and teach, and have the secretary.

11:45.779 --> 11:50.826
Well, he could operate the

11:51.835 --> 11:53.117
college the same way.

11:53.137 --> 11:53.718
He taught.

11:54.680 --> 12:08.022
And the secretary that he wanted

12:08.609 --> 12:11.593
was the most experienced secretary, was the one in geology.

12:12.154 --> 12:15.379
Unfortunately, her name was the same, Byers.

12:16.841 --> 12:20.727
So, no way.

12:20.747 --> 12:23.912
So, she couldn't become this.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.379
No, I think he did a very good job.

12:29.060 --> 12:35.950
Because you had a college to get off, and you had a college that

12:36.605 --> 12:41.011
that had to be research-oriented.

12:41.051 --> 12:44.776
And what was your primary research emphasis in that time?

12:48.521 --> 12:52.186
Well, I mainly was doing with radioactivity groundwater.

12:52.246 --> 12:58.194
I had a project for that, and then another one later on with Sandia.

12:58.214 --> 13:00.317
That went on how many years?

13:01.580 --> 13:10.070
Oh, total, that was only about six, seven years, because it's impossible to do that and run those summer institutes at the same time.

13:10.110 --> 13:11.912
It took too much work.

13:12.833 --> 13:25.647
And when I was doing both of those, I finally decided that I was no longer going to get involved

13:26.065 --> 13:28.730
to the extent that I didn't have a home life.

13:29.371 --> 13:41.094
In those days, I was home for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and get home about bedtime.

13:43.699 --> 13:46.504
So I was having to spend too much time

13:48.425 --> 13:52.192
working at the job to get it all done.

13:53.895 --> 14:12.087
And so then I have told department heads, I am going to go out for coffee twice a day, period, and you aren't going to see me after five o'clock.

14:12.421 --> 14:15.604
So I decided that my life was going to change.

14:15.664 --> 14:18.047
There's other things besides academia.

14:18.567 --> 14:28.096
Now compare the satisfactions of teaching to the satisfactions of research for you.

14:29.678 --> 14:31.680
Teaching is more satisfying.

14:31.700 --> 14:36.485
Running these summer institute programs is more satisfaction.

14:36.505 --> 14:40.909
You've got to have it because you're not going to get it monetarily.

14:42.678 --> 14:52.311
See, at one time, Travis Parker was acting head of the Department of Geology.

14:53.853 --> 15:09.495
And at that time, outside—if you take him as a head, well, outside of being a full professor, not being a head, I was the highest paid in the college engineering.

15:12.260 --> 15:21.676
The minute I got into it, handling teacher programs, I dropped down in relations.

15:21.696 --> 15:30.070
So by the time that I retired, I was the lowest paid full professor in the College of Geosciences.

15:31.873 --> 15:37.002
What should be the comparative salary of teaching and researching?

15:39.260 --> 15:53.083
Well, the way I feel about it is people going to a university ought to be given an option, what they want to do, be research-oriented or teaching-oriented, and the salaries ought to be comparable.

15:55.107 --> 16:03.681
But I don't—this university and all universities seem to have the tendency to swing from one extreme to the other.

16:05.095 --> 16:09.661
Sometimes they get intermediate where everything is balanced.

16:09.681 --> 16:16.069
You see, when I came to this place, you were penalized if you did research.

16:16.109 --> 16:29.927
And high teaching loads even when you were doing research, trying to use the research monies to help augment teaching salaries.

16:29.947 --> 16:33.432
And swung the other way now where

16:38.693 --> 16:41.836
If you're doing research in our department, no one's paying for it.

16:43.818 --> 16:45.560
The most you'll teach is one course.

16:45.580 --> 16:48.443
You've got to go get the research money outside.

16:51.326 --> 17:06.861
There was a comment that one of our staff members made to me when I pointed out at this induction of me into the Science Hall of Fame that my

17:08.832 --> 17:12.378
My one granddaughter, they wanted a picture with H. Ross Perot.

17:12.838 --> 17:19.489
So H. Ross Perot grabbed my wife and me and got us all in this little group where the picture was taken.

17:20.130 --> 17:21.813
I said, yes, I shook his hand.

17:22.835 --> 17:28.764
And the staff member said, did he give me any money?

17:29.666 --> 17:30.807
I said, no.

17:30.948 --> 17:35.515
But I said, that is what the university would be concerned about.

17:36.710 --> 17:49.496
As in the College of Geosciences, did any of the deans attempt to equalize this research and teaching emphasis?

17:53.123 --> 17:53.183
No.

17:54.007 --> 18:07.126
As you, I'm not gonna ask you the negative, as you look back on the now almost 30 years of the College of Geoscience, to what dean or deans would you give the highest mark?

18:07.747 --> 18:09.049
I'm not gonna ask you the lowest mark.

18:09.369 --> 18:12.473
Who did the best job, or best jobs?

18:13.475 --> 18:14.436
Probably Byers.

18:14.657 --> 18:15.618
Is that right?

18:15.638 --> 18:16.499
Why was he better?

18:16.599 --> 18:17.781
What did he do that was better?

18:18.722 --> 18:21.246
Well, I think he understood

18:22.424 --> 18:33.632
what his problem was in getting a new college started and getting it sort of integrated.

18:37.915 --> 18:47.188
From our department, the deans that have been from our department have always been over backwards to treat the other departments better.

18:49.151 --> 18:53.978
So you're saying it didn't help geology to have a geologist as the dean.

18:54.299 --> 18:54.920
That's right.

18:55.881 --> 19:01.990
In the years, all of your years, who has done the best job as department head?

19:06.096 --> 19:07.618
I had to think about that a lot.

19:21.115 --> 19:30.025
Well, probably the one that, the latest one, Rabinowitz, has done a pretty good job.

19:31.286 --> 19:40.056
And the reason is that he had to integrate two departments, geology and geophysics.

19:41.157 --> 19:47.865
See, actually, geophysics started off by just being in the geology department.

19:49.229 --> 19:57.059
And there wasn't a separate department, so now it's—it was the Department of Geology, and now it's the Department of Geology and Geophysics.

20:02.467 --> 20:10.377
I'd probably say the best faculty member I've ever seen in geology and geophilics was probably Dehlinger.

20:11.960 --> 20:15.128
It's D-E-H-L-I-N-G-E-R?

20:15.409 --> 20:16.391
Yeah, Peter Dalinger.

20:16.913 --> 20:19.259
He's been dead now about five years.

20:19.339 --> 20:20.281
What was his specialty?

20:21.404 --> 20:24.552
Geophysics and he...

20:25.797 --> 20:31.306
introduced the use of a gravity meter that is now generally used.

20:33.088 --> 20:49.915
Except he didn't stay here but about five or six years and then moved to Oregon State and then moved to the Office of Naval Research and then moved up to University of Connecticut where he started a

20:51.717 --> 21:00.131
Department of Oceanography, because essentially he was associated with geophysics of ocean basins.

21:03.656 --> 21:15.075
And of course, he was the head of the new college they started up there.

21:22.717 --> 21:36.793
No, I think Shirley Lynch probably was a darn good department head for his day, because he was teaching-oriented, not research-oriented.

21:38.798 --> 21:59.710
What the department, did it have any, did it earn a reputation for being particularly good in this and this and this among other, if we talked to other geology department people across the country, what would they say was A&M's strengths?

22:01.445 --> 22:05.491
Well, his strength was petroleum geology, but it no longer is.

22:07.113 --> 22:08.756
Should it be again?

22:09.978 --> 22:15.406
Well, we're in the middle of the oil patch, but oil patch there is left.

22:16.087 --> 22:18.791
Should A&M try to return to that as a specialty?

22:22.136 --> 22:29.787
I'm not so sure, because the departments that are rated the best probably don't produce any petroleum geologists at all.

22:30.108 --> 22:30.388
Really?

22:30.858 --> 22:53.134
See, the only one that's up there, what you're looking at in terms of geology is Caltech, and if you're geology and geophysics, MIT, Harvard, and that type of situation.

22:53.154 --> 22:57.000
So, those people are in the

22:57.402 --> 22:59.864
They get research grants and all of that.

23:00.184 --> 23:05.809
And so essentially, we're not ever going to be near there.

23:05.829 --> 23:20.802
Therefore, the way I look at this, since we're not going to be in the top 10 and unique in that way, we ought to use some of our traditions to be unique.

23:24.585 --> 23:26.667
Such as?

23:26.849 --> 23:37.823
If you have the bonfire and build it correctly, I've been against the bonfire for a long time because I think all of that wood could have been cut up and used to give to the poor to heat with.

23:38.885 --> 23:51.962
But you do need it because it is an engineering structure approved by an engineer, and this is why those people that were trying to get

23:53.528 --> 24:10.414
one set up outside the university and didn't have success is because there's going to be very few engineers that want a bonfire built that they're going to stake their license on.

24:10.434 --> 24:12.718
And it needs to be

24:13.778 --> 24:19.197
designed by a licensed engineer, and it needs to be built the way it's designed.

24:19.237 --> 24:25.780
This thing really got topsy-turvy here.

24:28.088 --> 24:32.092
What else in geology could and should A&M do?

24:32.893 --> 24:41.803
Well, right now I think our top programs are environmental and engineering, engineering, geology.

24:43.205 --> 24:53.316
See, occasionally petroleum comes back in and petroleum companies are hiring again, but gosh, most of the oil is produced overseas now.

24:54.357 --> 24:54.838
See,

24:58.008 --> 25:06.060
During World War II, we supplied the Allies with all the fuel.

25:09.165 --> 25:13.672
And this is one thing I remember about the British.

25:15.995 --> 25:26.631
Come Christmas and Boxing Day, be sure you have all the gasoline you need on base, because there's going to be no deliveries, even during the war.

25:28.197 --> 25:34.064
Because those people still tried to live a reasonable, normal life.

25:35.325 --> 25:40.792
A little difficult to do, but they made every attempt to do it.

25:40.812 --> 25:50.543
And I have a great admiration for them.

25:53.510 --> 26:09.075
Progress that the department made began to attract some international students, share some experiences of what it was like in the real world of teaching and research to have more international students here.

26:09.817 --> 26:13.122
Geophysics gets more of those than geology does.

26:13.102 --> 26:32.624
We had a program where we brought people in in geology for a year from Russia and then from—the president group here is from Aberdeer, however that foreign name goes.

26:32.665 --> 26:41.775
But they have to aim for the specific thing that they are weak in because

26:42.852 --> 26:50.260
and also the American way of doing things, because other people do things differently.

26:58.889 --> 27:11.543
One of the problems with Arabs is that any means is a legitimate means to arrive

27:12.502 --> 27:18.512
at a grade or something else.

27:18.912 --> 27:21.997
Did you ever have many international students in your classes?

27:22.037 --> 27:24.221
No, never have.

27:24.241 --> 27:27.947
But this is just what I've heard.

27:28.427 --> 27:34.858
Who were some of the notable colleagues that were brought in during your experience in geology?

27:35.318 --> 27:36.580
You mentioned a couple of them.

27:37.161 --> 27:38.323
Are there any others?

27:43.417 --> 27:45.939
Bob Berg, he was brought in.

27:46.860 --> 27:54.206
He, well Berg was probably one of the better department heads.

27:57.649 --> 28:00.271
Who were the best teachers in the department?

28:00.752 --> 28:02.914
Parker was, he got the award.

28:02.954 --> 28:03.754
Travis Parker?

28:03.774 --> 28:06.437
Yeah, he got one of the first teaching awards.

28:09.719 --> 28:12.782
And what was, as far as you know, what was good about his teaching?

28:13.673 --> 28:14.775
What made him a good teacher?

28:16.479 --> 28:17.761
Well, the students thought he was.

28:17.962 --> 28:20.006
No, no, I know, but what did they like about him?

28:20.186 --> 28:28.363
Well, I don't really know, because I never did listen to, sit in a lecture, no, listen to it.

28:28.523 --> 28:34.956
When you had any of his students in a follow-up course, were they always well prepared?

28:35.729 --> 28:37.011
Was his good?

28:37.031 --> 28:39.977
But generally, he was getting my students.

28:39.997 --> 28:40.338
Oh, okay.

28:40.358 --> 28:41.580
So he got yours.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.001
All right.

28:42.822 --> 28:47.351
Was there a... Who taught the big introductory sections?

28:49.195 --> 28:51.038
Well, in those days,

28:52.182 --> 28:55.869
Almost anybody would get assigned and make up a teaching loan.

28:56.991 --> 29:06.870
So, and generally there are only one or two sections, but now since it's part of the core curriculum, it's the only thing that makes the department survive.

29:07.471 --> 29:08.373
Ah.

29:08.393 --> 29:10.697
About how big are those sections now?

29:10.947 --> 29:23.133
Roughly, we'll have a class of, the lecture room will hold 188, so normally there'd be about 180 in that.

29:24.195 --> 29:27.021
These are freshmen and sophomores taking it?

29:27.181 --> 29:30.508
Yeah, and essentially

29:32.834 --> 29:41.605
Well, I guess we teach about 2,000 students a year, so it makes a very large impact.

29:41.625 --> 29:48.975
So, if you do a lousy job in teaching in there, you're going to lose students.

29:49.035 --> 29:55.163
So, some of the, I'd say some of the teachers in there doing an excellent job probably

29:56.898 --> 30:01.142
Believe it or not, one of our deans probably does a better occasion.

30:01.162 --> 30:02.924
He teaches Geology 101.

30:03.124 --> 30:03.584
Who's that?

30:03.744 --> 30:04.465
Giordino.

30:05.005 --> 30:05.106
Oh.

30:05.946 --> 30:07.348
Graduate studies.

30:08.569 --> 30:08.709
Mm-hmm.

30:08.729 --> 30:08.869
Mm-hmm.

30:08.889 --> 30:15.335
They keep changing that around, director and then dean and director, so you never know what the title is going to be.

30:18.017 --> 30:24.103
The, who, nationally, who would have been the most

30:24.590 --> 30:29.318
well-known researchers in the department in the last 20 years or so?

30:30.800 --> 30:31.261
Handon.

30:32.423 --> 30:32.503
Who?

30:32.523 --> 30:33.244
John Handon.

30:33.264 --> 30:33.945
John Handon.

30:34.366 --> 30:35.107
His specialty.

30:35.909 --> 30:37.792
Rock mechanics.

30:37.812 --> 30:41.478
And of course John here came from Shell.

30:41.518 --> 30:43.982
He was already established when he came.

30:44.620 --> 30:52.249
And that probably did more for the department in changing the way the department operated than anyone else.

30:52.389 --> 31:07.506
See, that's what they really need to do now is to go out and get a holder of—see, we've got a bunch of vacant chairs, but the problem is with vacant chairs, you've got to have state money also.

31:07.486 --> 31:18.373
Because you can't provide more than—even with a million-dollar chair, you can only provide about half the resources.
