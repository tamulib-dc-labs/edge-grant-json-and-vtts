WEBVTT

00:05.279 --> 00:08.323
Then you came back to College Station. I didn't 
come back until after the first of the year. They

00:13.970 --> 00:17.595
started, you might say, a new school year. Was this 
new for all the classes? I know for the seniors. For

00:23.622 --> 00:24.263
the seniors. I was wondering whether it was just 
for the seniors. I don't remember about that. And

00:29.610 --> 00:33.615
then you went until... We went until it was... Late 
June, I believe. You had a regular commencement

00:36.190 --> 00:37.892
after that. That's right. It was, we went some 
longer than we normally would have. You remember,

00:45.581 --> 00:55.773
was there, well, I guess it was almost all the 
seniors that were off at this training camp, and so

00:45.581 --> 00:55.773
they, the whole senior class came back sort of at 
one time. That's about right, yes. A couple more

01:00.198 --> 01:03.282
things about your school days, I noticed you were a 
member of the Ross Volunteers. Yes, sir. Was that,

01:09.559 --> 01:11.902
were that both junior and senior years? No, just 
senior. Senior year. Yes. And at the time you were

01:14.827 --> 01:19.755
there, how did one become a member of the Ross 
Volunteers? By the election of the members that

01:20.656 --> 01:26.586
were already in. And then did someone who was a 
member of the Ross Volunteers then nominate you?

01:31.898 --> 01:32.439
That's right. That's the way it worked. Then you 
were chosen by election through those who were

01:34.021 --> 01:36.544
there. That's right. What did the Ross Volunteers 
do? Was it service to the school or to anybody?

01:46.897 --> 01:51.722
Well, they didn't do very much. They were supposed 
to be kind of a crack drill team, but I don't

01:56.148 --> 02:07.681
remember that we did much drilling, at least the 
year I was in it.

02:11.005 --> 02:22.257
They'd just have a little party when they'd take in 
some new members, you know, and go over to the, was

02:11.005 --> 02:22.257
this, what was the Ross Valley, RV Hop? Well, that 
was a dance. Yeah, I forgot that. Yes, it did. They

02:27.712 --> 02:31.757
have a big dance once a year. You

02:32.358 --> 02:37.304
didn't have a lot of extra drill then? No, not a lot. 
In fact,

02:40.087 --> 02:51.602
I was wondering, today I know the Ross Volunteers, 
they march in certain parades, and they're always

02:40.087 --> 02:51.602
at the Mardi Gras. I was wondering if, when you were 
in the RVs, whether they did anything of that

02:52.122 --> 02:56.809
nature? I can't recall that we did.

03:03.258 --> 03:07.164
You sort of had an initiation party and a big dance. 
Yeah, but the dance is really the big thing about

03:07.484 --> 03:13.993
it, yes. I noticed you were also a member of the 
Campus Club. Do you recall what that organization

03:18.480 --> 03:20.523
was? I don't remember what that was.

03:27.155 --> 03:28.216
I don't remember. I sure don't. And also the 
chemical club, I imagine that was just all the

03:30.899 --> 03:36.284
people who were either chemistry or chemical 
engineering. That's right. The campus club, I

03:38.426 --> 03:43.751
don't seem to recall what that might have been. One

03:43.811 --> 03:54.782
incident that occurred while you were a student 
that is of interest to us, that is primarily to my

03:55.910 --> 04:02.900
assistant and me, is the incident of the branding 
of the University of Texas steer in 1917. Do you

04:02.920 --> 04:06.265
have any recollections of that? Wasn't that in the 
fall of 15, when they branded 13 to nothing on it?

04:12.434 --> 04:14.677
Well, I believe that was the 1915 score. That was. I 
thought they branded the steer, I think it was. It

04:21.567 --> 04:24.010
was the winter of 17, I believe, that they did that. 
Well, they branded this 13 to nothing on a steer,

04:26.099 --> 04:39.959
and I think it was the steer that Mast got for the 
university. At least I've seen pictures of it.

04:43.564 --> 04:53.659
Well, I understand that one of the people who 
participated in the branding took pictures of it

04:43.564 --> 04:53.659
after it was branded and sold them on campus for 25 
cents apiece. I don't remember. It's a very

04:56.280 --> 04:57.502
popular item. I think I've even seen it have in the 
archives, as a matter of fact, a picture of

04:57.923 --> 05:05.915
somebody's dormitory room with pennants all 
around. And I believe there's a framed picture of

05:06.976 --> 05:11.744
this branded steer on the wall, too. Is that the one 
that had the 13 to nothing? 13 to nothing on the

05:14.448 --> 05:16.631
side. That was in fall of 15 when that took place, I 
think. I just hadn't mentioned this, having a

05:23.002 --> 05:33.973
picture of a dormitory room with a lot of felt 
pennants hanging around the wall. Was that a

05:33.993 --> 05:35.354
fairly common thing? Yes. Lots of people decorate 
their rooms in that nature? That's true, yes.

05:44.222 --> 05:51.169
Now, going on from, say, your graduation in June of 
1919, what did you do? after that? I mean did you

05:52.333 --> 05:56.820
have a job by the time you graduated or did you then 
go job hunting after? No, we were, there was a man

05:57.140 --> 06:18.473
came down from the Empire Gas and Fuel Company 
which is a subsidiary of City Service Company and

05:57.140 --> 06:18.473
was recruiting people and there was about seven or 
eight of us, I think, that

06:19.904 --> 06:31.062
went up to work for them as a result of this 
recruiting. Where did you go? You say you went up? I

06:34.187 --> 06:37.432
went to Bartlesville, Oklahoma. That's where the 
main office was at the time. And of course, from

06:41.438 --> 06:47.548
there, after being there a period of time, we were 
send out other jobs in the field. We were known as

06:52.241 --> 06:54.804
junior engineers. What they did was to

06:54.884 --> 07:18.312
give you as much general experience, 
roustabouting or whatever it might be to give you

06:54.884 --> 07:18.312
as good a background in the industry as you could 
for period of two years. Most of us went on a regular

07:23.033 --> 07:41.609
job before the two years was up, but two years was 
supposed to be the length of the period when you

07:23.033 --> 07:41.609
were designated as a junior engineer. Uh-huh, and 
then after you became, after you stepped out of

07:49.223 --> 07:52.086
this junior engineering status. You stayed with 
this Empire Oil and Gas? The name of it was changed

07:57.831 --> 08:06.138
after that to Empire Oil and Refining Company. And 
then in later years, it now would be what's known as

08:06.158 --> 08:13.025
City Service Oil Company. Where all did you work 
for the Empire? The

08:19.784 --> 08:48.340
first regular job that I had was in the

08:19.784 --> 08:48.340
central dehydration plant

08:19.784 --> 08:48.340
about nine miles south of Augusta, Kansas.

08:50.800 --> 09:20.638
incidentally at that time the

08:50.800 --> 09:20.638
hours were 12 hours a day seven days a week and when 
you went to change shifts you worked 18 hours and

08:50.800 --> 09:20.638
was off 18 hours and that put you on the night shift 
to the day shift yeah that's right but uh what was

08:50.800 --> 09:20.638
your pay or do you recall well it wasn't very high I 
don't really recall. Do

09:23.030 --> 09:28.838
you recall how long you stayed with Empire?

09:32.243 --> 09:43.538
Well I stayed on that job for possibly

09:32.243 --> 09:43.538
a year or two and then I

09:49.964 --> 10:18.300
I was an assistant farm boss for possibly a year and 
then I dressed tools on a clean out rig, cleaning

09:49.964 --> 10:18.300
out the wells, something that happened to them, 
you know, maybe the pipe had gotten Cuban gotten

10:19.073 --> 10:31.586
fastened in there and he'd have to get it out or cave 
in, he'd have to drill out the cavings and things

10:19.073 --> 10:31.586
like that. Who did you work for after you left 
Empire? I worked for White Eagle Oil and Refining

10:35.590 --> 10:45.020
Company for about a year in the refinery at 
Augusta, Kansas. And then where did you go after

10:45.040 --> 10:47.342
that? After that I went back to the Empire

10:48.284 --> 11:16.654
and went in the chemical department and I was in 
charge of the field work and treating a, we had a bad

10:48.284 --> 11:16.654
corrosion problem in both the Eldorado and 
Augusta fields. And

11:16.938 --> 11:30.871
we treated those wells with primarily caustic 
soda. This was corrosion in the well pipes? Yes,

11:33.293 --> 11:39.959
and the water was very corrosive with the oil in 
those fields. So you had to do something so as not to

11:39.979 --> 11:42.841
have to replace them? That's right, to at least 
reduce the frequency. And I did that for

11:49.034 --> 11:57.105
possibly a couple of years, I guess. And then they, 
I was transferred to the production engineering

11:58.748 --> 12:10.725
department and moved to Madison, Kansas, where 
that's in Greenwood County. Madison is about 20

12:12.868 --> 12:16.493
miles south of Emporia. to give you an idea where it 
is. And there I was

12:20.489 --> 12:44.353
all helped look after drilling in the wells and 
what more thing that I did mostly was look after

12:20.489 --> 12:44.353
repressuring with gas and then one little field up 
there repressured with air, but most of it was with

12:44.789 --> 12:51.698
gas to try to increase the recovery of oil.

12:54.101 --> 13:13.446
And I was on that job when the

12:54.101 --> 13:13.446
Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, which 
was

13:14.675 --> 13:39.265
a joint effort by city service and several other 
companies to build a pipeline from the Chicago

13:14.675 --> 13:39.265
area down into this panhandle field where there 
had been a large field of gas outlined and there was

13:39.953 --> 14:08.948
at that time very little market for the gas because 
there wasn't very many people living near the

13:39.953 --> 14:08.948
field so this

13:39.953 --> 14:08.948
pipeline was built and I was

13:39.953 --> 14:08.948
hired when that work began and I came here to 
Amarillo production engineer for that. That man

14:12.761 --> 14:24.497
later became superintendent of production.

14:24.537 --> 14:30.905
Was that Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America 
previously called the Texoma Natural Gas? That's

14:30.925 --> 14:31.666
right. Texoma Production Company I believe it 
was. But it was always actually a part of the

14:38.965 --> 14:43.211
natural gas pipeline company. I don't recall now 
just why they for a number of years they had that

14:43.391 --> 15:00.133
name changed but it was a purely a bookkeeping 
thing it was all part of the natural gas pipeline

14:43.391 --> 15:00.133
company all the time. And did you say the natural 
gas pipeline company was something formed by

15:01.655 --> 15:07.302
several other oil companies? Yes it was City 
Service was a prime mover in it. The other

15:13.178 --> 15:28.854
companies that were interested in it in the 
beginning was the

15:13.178 --> 15:28.854
company that then had

15:13.178 --> 15:28.854
the distribution in Chicago. I don't remember 
whether that was called People's Gas Company at

15:28.914 --> 15:34.420
that time or not. Gaslight and Coke Company, I'm 
not sure, but anyway, they had an interest, and

15:35.851 --> 15:57.373
several of the other companies that had acreage in 
this field, gas producing acreage, joined in the

15:35.851 --> 15:57.373
beginning. Texas Company and Phillips, Skelly,

16:05.585 --> 16:19.104
I

16:05.585 --> 16:19.104
can't recall now any others.

16:20.807 --> 16:29.499
But some of those companies were bought out by the 
others early in the operation. And finally, the

16:29.599 --> 16:33.465
people's company bought the city service and 
became the sole owner of it.

16:43.797 --> 16:50.407
So the natural gas pipeline company laid the 
pipeline and also produced it. Did they also

16:51.108 --> 16:53.391
produce the gas? That's right. A portion of the 
gas, one of the interested parties was the company

17:02.791 --> 17:26.622
that owned the Canadian River Gas Company and 
instead of selling their gas rights to the new

17:02.791 --> 17:26.622
company they had a contract to furnish a portion 
which would I believe 25% of the requirements from

17:02.791 --> 17:26.622
their own acres.

17:27.260 --> 17:33.948
Your last job then with the natural gas pipeline 
company was as superintendent of production.

17:34.228 --> 17:34.368
Yes. Did you have then, in that capacity, you had a 
sizable number of people working under you, did

17:35.750 --> 17:41.256
you? Well, yes, good many.

17:47.123 --> 17:51.107
At what point did you then leave the company. When I 
got too old. Was that your decision that you were

17:55.520 --> 17:57.844
too old or theirs? Well, they thought that I was. 
They had a retirement system and a sort of a

18:01.852 --> 18:09.568
compulsory retirement. At what age, at what point 
then did you retire? At what year? At age 65. So that

18:17.515 --> 18:18.877
would have been 64. That was in 1964, that's right. 
And you just continued to live here in Amarillo?

18:23.743 --> 18:26.647
That's right. Are you involved in any things in 
Amarillo at the moment?

18:34.838 --> 18:35.779
You mean working? Well, that or... Well, let's 
say, for example, in College Station, a lot of the

18:39.805 --> 18:49.112
retired faculty members do all kinds of services 
for the community. Some of them serve in political

18:49.153 --> 18:52.964
office and things of that nature. No, no. I do a 
little bit of consulting work, but not enough to

18:55.853 --> 19:05.564
amount

18:55.853 --> 19:05.564
to anything. This would be in the area of chemical 
engineering that you'd be consulting? Well, no.

19:09.969 --> 19:22.924
This particular thing that I do is more in 
connection with the price of gas.

19:23.680 --> 19:52.945
My background during my time with the natural gas 
pipeline company was largely

19:23.680 --> 19:52.945
administrative in connection with the land and 
also the production and had pretty good

19:23.680 --> 19:52.945
exposure to what prices of gas were around here 
Railroad Commission in Texas became quite

19:53.752 --> 20:16.114
interested in it back a long time ago when there was 
a law passed

19:53.752 --> 20:16.114
known as the Hazelwood bill which allowed

20:18.271 --> 20:32.487
carbon black companies to use sweet gas to 
manufacture carbon black, provided they paid as

20:18.271 --> 20:32.487
much as the pipelines paid. I don't remember the 
wording of it, but that's the essence of it. And as a

20:37.533 --> 20:48.025
result of that, it became necessary for the 
commission to make a determination

20:50.165 --> 21:02.439
that was provided in this Hazelwood bill, either 
annually or semi-annually, about what the price

20:50.165 --> 21:02.439
paid by the pipeline company was. So we had, and our 
company, had already been making a computation at

21:04.341 --> 21:19.277
the time that bill was passed.

21:20.084 --> 21:30.755
because of a contract we had with one of our major 
royalty owners, and we'd been doing that for our

21:20.084 --> 21:30.755
own use for two or three years before then. So,

21:31.836 --> 21:46.891
as long as I was with the company, I did

21:31.836 --> 21:46.891
that for the commission as a representative of the 
company. And then when I retired, major pipeline

21:50.948 --> 22:03.082
companies asked me if I wouldn't go ahead and do 
that for them as a consultant. So I did one or two

22:03.883 --> 22:18.120
other jobs several years ago, but that's about the 
extent of my work that I do once a year. What would

22:19.822 --> 22:27.273
you say, I mean, you were involved in, say, the 
production of natural gas for a goodly number of

22:19.822 --> 22:27.273
years. Would be some of the major advancements or 
developments, improvements in the field of

22:28.956 --> 22:40.253
gasoline production? Natural gas production, 
you mean?

22:47.564 --> 22:49.086
I can't think of any. Was there

22:50.011 --> 23:08.458
a more efficient system in 64 when you retired as 
opposed to

22:50.011 --> 23:08.458
the time when you started?

23:12.444 --> 23:14.567
No, I can't think of any.

23:19.593 --> 23:26.242
I don't, I don't really believe I can point to any 
particular improvement. Was there perhaps some

23:27.644 --> 23:32.610
some decrease in the amount that might have been 
wasted? Oh well yeah there was a back before

23:34.933 --> 23:49.212
long in the early 30s

23:49.512 --> 23:57.419
when the

23:49.512 --> 23:57.419
condition was just the reverse of what it is now. 
People

23:57.459 --> 24:09.329
had gas all over this place, I mean producers and 
owners of production, and they had no market. And

24:10.470 --> 24:18.777
we had a lot of lawsuits trying to force the 
pipeline companies buy the gas from these people

24:19.533 --> 24:48.527
and they hadn't provided acreage of their own and 
didn't have enough market at that time to satisfy

24:19.533 --> 24:48.527
their own royalty owners and so as a result of that 
there was gasoline plants built and gas processed

24:49.334 --> 24:55.103
and not even burned for carbon black, but blown 
into the air. And at the time they got to where it

24:55.543 --> 25:05.518
was, well I'd say an excess of a billion cubic feet a 
day being blown to the air from this field. And we'd

25:07.241 --> 25:16.675
have projects of inviting these legislators from 
Austin and we'd take them on tours around through

25:17.195 --> 25:27.367
the field, kind of like these outfits used to do, 
trying to sell land or something. And finally, in

25:28.548 --> 25:42.544
about 1935, well, they tightened up the statue 
down in Austin and put a stop to that, but it was

25:42.862 --> 25:44.424
Awful lot of gas. That is, put a stop to blowing it 
into the air.

25:50.672 --> 25:56.480
But before it was done, there was a terrible lot of 
it blown into the air. Of course, it's kind of hard

25:56.560 --> 26:02.067
to imagine that with conditions as they are now. 
Yeah, it's sort of reversed from initially it was a

26:02.168 --> 26:10.719
product looking for a market, and now it's a market 
looking for a product. That's exactly right. It's

26:13.979 --> 26:20.346
a complete 100% turnaround.

26:20.927 --> 26:23.270
But it wasn't anybody's. I don't think it was any 
individual's or company's fault. It was just a

26:28.896 --> 26:32.240
condition that existed. But let me make sure I 
understand you correctly. This was refined gas

26:35.163 --> 26:38.347
that was being blown into the air. It wasn't 
directly from the well. It was after it had been

26:41.570 --> 26:43.993
through a gasoline. They did extract the 
gasoline, but it was a low content gasoline. It was

26:48.500 --> 26:55.009
just natural gas from which gasoline had been 
extracted. They did that just because they didn't

26:55.109 --> 27:00.236
have any if they left them. If they didn't do that, 
well the well would be shut in and they wouldn't

27:00.817 --> 27:05.704
have any revenue. to get that much revenue out of 
it. So they were taking, if I understand it

27:08.351 --> 27:13.280
correctly, the liquid gasoline from the natural 
gas. Right, right. And the natural gas was being

27:14.462 --> 27:17.828
just blown into the air. That's right. And the 
liquid gasoline. And worse than that, it wasn't

27:20.071 --> 27:24.479
even good gas for that purpose. It had a content of 
about around three-tenths of a gallon per

27:24.559 --> 27:32.232
thousand. And uh but there was a market for the 
liquid. Yeah yeah but uh it was a pretty big waste to

27:37.339 --> 27:45.369
to get that. Well was this liquid gasoline then 
suitable for use in automobile engines or? Well no

27:49.954 --> 27:58.805
it uh it was used mostly as a blending in a in a 
refinery. It was probably used by refineries and

27:58.825 --> 28:02.590
blendings. wasn't sold directly to the motoring 
public.

28:15.446 --> 28:33.268
Did you have any sort of outstanding experiences 
or interesting things happen to you while you were

28:15.446 --> 28:33.268
involved in all of the years of production?

28:35.881 --> 28:38.625
I don't think I can recall. Is

28:38.725 --> 28:57.293
the field of production limited to the area once 
the gas is out of the ground and it does not involve

28:38.725 --> 28:57.293
the drilling end of it, does it? Well, yeah, the 
drilling is part of the production. Is part of the

29:01.900 --> 29:02.801
production. Yeah. So

29:05.530 --> 29:28.686
my particular responsibility, though, had to do 
more with seeing that it was properly allocated

29:05.530 --> 29:28.686
and

29:05.530 --> 29:28.686
dealing with the royalty owners and things of that 
kind. Did the oil and gas companies lease the

29:29.830 --> 29:39.303
mineral rights or buy the mineral rights to land 
instead of buying the land itself? You mean the

29:41.146 --> 29:43.429
natural gas pipeline company? Yeah, well, you 
were talking about royalties to property owners.

29:47.615 --> 29:59.432
Yeah, well, the company had gas rights under oil 
and gas leases, and all those oil and gas leases

29:47.615 --> 29:59.432
were taken from landowners in which royalty was 
reserved. So, yes, you had quite a little contact

30:03.590 --> 30:08.102
with the royalty owners. Always wanting more 
money, of course.
