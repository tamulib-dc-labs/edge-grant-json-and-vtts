WEBVTT

00:02.495 --> 00:08.704
Okay, you're describing the program at the... 
Now, we would have cabins, we called it. And in each

00:09.986 --> 00:18.438
cabin, we would have quartered about 10 students. 
And a volunteer from civil engineering would... A

00:20.461 --> 00:31.557
student would...

00:31.975 --> 00:42.575
be in the cabin and sort of look after the kids and 
tell them to knock it off or get the lights out and

00:31.975 --> 00:42.575
this sort of thing. It was kind of GI at first. I 
gradually got worked out of that, but we would blow

00:47.243 --> 00:55.198
the bugle calls in this. By the time we got in about 
1955, we didn't do that. The civil engineers had a

01:05.585 --> 01:09.450
classroom. Those that didn't want to volunteer 
would live in cabins off to themselves. The

01:19.444 --> 01:23.650
geology students, I put them up at the far end. 
because they had very little, they had no places

01:24.338 --> 01:34.250
that is formed. We had good food, we had cabins back 
out behind the dining hall for the cooks, and it was

01:36.353 --> 01:52.793
pleasant duty for everybody. I had no difficulty 
recruiting fine professors. Now, normally

01:58.410 --> 02:02.255
about, what was the total enrollment per six 
weeks? Oh, we were limited to about 250 students

02:02.615 --> 02:07.883
total. Did you normally fill up? Oh, yes. So 500 per 
summer. Now, that didn't include the CEs and the

02:15.953 --> 02:20.620
geography. Oh, I forgot those. I was going to ask 
about what percentage of the entering freshman

02:23.705 --> 02:30.614
class would go to Junction?

02:34.539 --> 02:41.448
I'm a little bit hesitant here because, frankly, I 
don't remember too accurately. But I'll tell you a

02:42.249 --> 02:49.018
source for that.

02:51.822 --> 02:52.783
McCandless... The first thing he did when he got to 
be assistant dean, he sent a graduate student over

02:53.017 --> 03:10.095
and said, now, Austin, are you going to write that 
dissertation on the adjunct, or are you not? And I

03:10.115 --> 03:15.161
said, well, Haskell, Wayne Hall helped me. He 
said, Austin, you have a job at this university all

03:16.382 --> 03:21.167
your life. You don't worry about it. Somewhere on 
this campus, you're going to be used. But he said,

03:28.437 --> 03:31.580
you're going to pay a penalty. I said, yes, sir, I 
understand that. I was very content because

03:34.783 --> 03:43.953
Haskell, I found a chance to do in life what I really 
wanted to do. What could be better? I am so

03:45.094 --> 03:48.458
grateful. As you look back on the adjunct, Did you 
feel that the youngsters that went there

03:51.590 --> 04:12.279
demonstrated, once they got to the main campus as 
full-time students, they demonstrated that

03:51.590 --> 04:12.279
they'd been, that those were... Oh, mechanics 
found that they had done markedly better,

03:51.590 --> 04:12.279
markedly better. And it kind of was one of these 
things that worked itself out. In a few summers,

04:16.625 --> 04:20.550
say beginning about 55, The better students you 
see would apply and get a reservation before, they

04:21.070 --> 04:30.701
always do, you know, that's one reason they're 
what they are. So this was not, by and large, after

04:31.201 --> 04:37.789
it got going, these were not the marginal. Oh no, 
no, these were the best students. Well, Jeff

04:41.673 --> 04:50.503
Wentworth, I knew that his father, his father and I 
worked in the library together. it was kind of

04:50.838 --> 05:13.268
typical of that and you you every once in a while you 
will hear someone say I was at the adjunct surely

04:50.838 --> 05:13.268
you have some anecdotes you can share about some 
experiences well yes

05:13.771 --> 05:23.502
I think, though, that I would like to think about 
that and jot some things down. But we did not have a

05:23.522 --> 05:26.926
discipline talk. Haskell, we, Louie Howe used to 
say, Austin, you going to excuse me from the back of

05:27.006 --> 05:38.219
large service tonight? And I'd say, no, Louie, we 
wouldn't want to miss you. But I simply had a

05:43.167 --> 05:48.092
meeting the first night of everyone. And I told 
them there are two purposes

05:48.773 --> 05:59.005
at coming out here at Six Feet. One purpose is to 
learn. The other purpose is to teach. There are no

06:06.421 --> 06:12.110
privileges other than the privilege to learn and 
the privilege to teach. And I don't want to see any

06:12.691 --> 06:18.180
sign of privileges. One nut, one summer, stomped 
some Coke bottles on the ground. I made him dig them

06:22.747 --> 06:32.462
out and wash them.

06:32.602 --> 06:34.285
We had an old history talk. One little anecdote I 
remember that Louie Howard told that they took, in

06:34.923 --> 06:47.037
his English class, they took a break to go, I think, 
go get a Coke or something in the middle of the

06:34.923 --> 06:47.037
morning. And as they're walking over there, one of 
the kids almost stabbed his foot on a horse

06:47.718 --> 06:57.950
crippler cactus.

07:00.594 --> 07:01.875
When they got back, Louis a sign they were doing in 
their English class. He said, all right, I want one

07:05.574 --> 07:15.623
of you, I want each of you to write me a one-page 
essay on something that you have learned or

07:05.574 --> 07:15.623
discovered in the last two or three days. This 
youngster wrote his essay about having

07:16.524 --> 07:30.277
discovered a new kind of cactus, and this young 
man's ear had heard Louis say the word as

07:16.524 --> 07:30.277
W-H-O-R-E-S, crippler. And Louis said that the 
facial expression of the youngster when he gave

07:32.382 --> 07:44.486
him the paperback was demonstration that it was 
not a prank, that he had misunderstood the word.

07:44.626 --> 07:53.985
Let's see, I'm assuming that few of them, if any, 
had cars, so that you didn't worry about their

07:44.626 --> 07:53.985
driving around or anything? Dr. Segrist took care 
of that.

07:59.346 --> 08:05.114
We gave them, they had to register their car with 
us. But I'm sure they didn't wander around much. Oh

08:07.598 --> 08:10.302
no, oh no. That car had to be back in on the campus in 
the place assigned them at 10 o'clock. As far as you

08:17.733 --> 08:22.200
know, was that a self-supporting? that is, it 
paid? Well, yes. I know this, that we became pretty

08:28.440 --> 08:36.869
crowded there after about 1959. Dean

08:38.530 --> 08:48.120
Graham was the one that worked this out. What they 
did was they borrowed from the red dollar the money

08:49.298 --> 09:06.641
that was needed and they built some additional, 
well they built a faculty house and they did some

08:49.298 --> 09:06.641
other things. The facilities were pretty good. 
They,

09:13.310 --> 09:17.736
the, The geology students were a little bit of a 
problem. That was because I think that they didn't

09:24.917 --> 09:28.601
have formal classes. And they were 
upperclassmen. They were upperclassmen. And you

09:32.645 --> 09:41.713
had to do, every once in a while, you had to do 
something pretty abrupt to kind of remind them. We

09:41.733 --> 09:48.820
told them very clearly that they were not to take 
those cars out on the grass to one of the cabins to

09:48.952 --> 09:51.696
put their gear in. The grass is too precious to me. 
Well, the geology, two cars of geology, they paid

09:55.362 --> 10:01.152
no attention. And so when they, I waited until the 
evening meal and then I asked them to come by and see

10:01.172 --> 10:09.666
me. I told them I would need their keys. And they 
said, what do you mean? I said, I mean that I'm going

10:18.072 --> 10:22.477
to ground you. And furthermore, I'm not only going 
to ground you, but I'm going to take your

10:22.497 --> 10:35.994
permission to keep the car on the campus. I said, 
now, if you want to park it up there on that road that

10:36.014 --> 10:40.339
runs into it, That's up to you, but you're not going 
to bring it on us. And oh man, they began to try every

10:45.650 --> 10:52.378
trick in the world. Well, I thought it over that 
night, and I told them the next morning that I think

10:53.819 --> 11:04.892
I'd just make that probation. And so I had to kind of 
do that. The geologists were kind of free spirits.

11:13.716 --> 11:23.769
And I've learned over the years, and I mean this in a 
kind way, but geologists, they like this he-man

11:13.716 --> 11:23.769
image, you know, tough. Now surely there must be a 
student prank or two that you can remember. that

11:31.585 --> 11:33.568
can be put on tape? Oh yes, I can help that. What was 
that song they were all singing

11:37.854 --> 11:46.586
that summer? It was a song that,

11:46.766 --> 11:56.580
well, it was a popular song. So we had a speaker 
system with the speakers up above the dining hall

11:56.948 --> 12:13.774
typical thing and we would blow taps and that was 
just an easy way to say get your lights out. So one

12:14.556 --> 12:22.568
night about three o'clock in the morning This 
burst of music sounded. Just tremendous sound.

12:29.142 --> 12:30.946
And it was playing this song. And

12:31.547 --> 12:37.758
there was a young man named Clay. He was the camp 
counselor and he was on the... staff of the basic

12:43.625 --> 12:47.130
division. But he needed extra money and he tore out 
for the dining hall. He couldn't get in. And the

12:58.347 --> 13:02.854
music was just, oh man, you could hear it in 
junctions. Calls were being, I got telephone

13:02.954 --> 13:09.784
calls and we Well, we didn't know what in the 
dickens we were going to do. And one of the fellas

13:14.430 --> 13:19.939
said, I bet you can get through the bathroom 
window. And we said, oh, well, there's just a

13:21.702 --> 13:28.313
women's bath, a restroom. And I said, well, get in 
the window anyway, if you can get inside. So we got

13:35.829 --> 13:45.242
one of the little skinny ones, and we got him in, and 
he got in there and turned it off. Did you ever

13:46.464 --> 13:48.347
discover who the culprit was? Well, you know, 
Haskell, sometimes it's better to just let

13:48.827 --> 13:55.937
someone know. What is it the blacks say? Leave it 
be. Leave it be. Yes, it was something everyone

14:01.866 --> 14:13.183
talked about, but they shot their wad because we 
certainly took care of that outlet. And by and

14:13.203 --> 14:22.958
large, was there a good grade performance rate by 
Junction students in the courses they took out

14:13.203 --> 14:22.958
there? Yes. We

14:23.778 --> 14:30.364
rarely ever, frankly, had a student fail. I'm 
going to make an L. Who were some of the faculty

14:30.464 --> 14:40.574
members that you remember out there with greatest 
pride and joy? Well, you know, I had good men. I had

14:44.097 --> 14:45.058
good men. In the English department, I had people 
like Mr. Louis Howe. I had Mr.

14:51.875 --> 15:05.529
Criswell, the kids call him

14:51.875 --> 15:05.529
Mama. We had Stanley Archer that died recently. We 
had, oh,

15:22.604 --> 15:36.724
Well, in math, we had Hale Perry, who probably was 
one of the best supervisors of introductory math.

15:37.004 --> 15:41.811
Bill Perry was his understudy. Perry will tell you 
that Hale was something else. We had a Mr. Liles, an

15:49.309 --> 15:56.117
old-fashioned schoolteacher type. We had

15:56.157 --> 16:08.430
this fella from Alabama.

16:08.870 --> 16:10.752
The kids called him Deacon. I have to think about 
this. We had excellent people, with an exception

16:16.326 --> 16:21.635
or two. And you didn't have any trouble recruiting 
faculty? Oh, no. Back in the 50s, or even 60s,

16:26.923 --> 16:33.674
summer work was... Oh, sure. That's right. That 
was a bonus. Oh, yeah. That's right. And I remember

16:38.586 --> 16:46.297
with Louie Howe, people like him went fairly 
regularly. We wouldn't open without Louie. About

16:49.922 --> 16:54.949
how many faculty would you have per six weeks' 
term? Oh, we would have three in English and three

16:56.271 --> 17:00.697
in history. Wait, you said history? Yes. Uh-huh. 
Yeah, pre- Oh, that's right. Treat. Treat was

17:08.676 --> 17:09.957
quite good.

17:13.260 --> 17:21.127
I remember one summer, Treat would hold a help 
session after evening meal. And the kids would get

17:21.347 --> 17:23.108
him started. And he's like all of us. If you get in 
your discipline, you get started. But they'd give

17:29.574 --> 17:34.738
him a standing ovation when he would come in. And 
then, too, when I first became director, I

17:34.955 --> 17:49.735
followed the procedure, and we would have a prof go 
through the cabins to help them. But Haskell, that

17:49.996 --> 17:56.985
was creating more distraction. So I changed it 
over to a professor in one of the rooms up in the

17:57.005 --> 18:04.135
academic building. administration building. 
And that's the way we handled that. But they did not

18:09.784 --> 18:13.988
have to study. I wouldn't want to get into this core 
business world. But they had to be quiet. And they

18:20.936 --> 18:24.380
couldn't be out running around in the other areas. 
We had no problem with that. And many of the better

18:28.624 --> 18:34.611
students would go up to almost every health 
station. They were going to get everything out of

18:35.030 --> 18:37.272
it they could. And the physical education people 
were very good. I had people like Palmer, Les

18:45.320 --> 18:56.050
Palmer, Herman Segrist,

18:45.320 --> 18:56.050
Paul Andrews. You know, Paul lived till he was 
almost 100. They were good people. And they fit

19:04.561 --> 19:10.949
into the

19:04.561 --> 19:10.949
community well. You know, I had an English prof 
that was, what was his name? He was the voice of the

19:20.041 --> 19:23.205
Aggies.

19:25.327 --> 19:28.311
Had this Boston accent.

19:32.577 --> 19:32.897
Well, It will come to us, but I remember, you know 
this fella could hardly talk without profanity.

19:43.953 --> 19:49.301
And that worried me, because we were going to a 
small community.

19:51.564 --> 19:54.548
And the A&M Mother's Club, invited him to speak to 
them on one of the plays. And I thought, oh man, this

20:03.684 --> 20:09.352
is one I'm going to have to play. But you know, I 
worried all afternoon while that was held. And

20:15.121 --> 20:22.171
then the president called me and she said, he's 
wonderful. I said, She said, yes, we've never had a

20:25.072 --> 20:31.181
more charming, courteous person. And I thought, 
thank God. And then I thought, you know, he's smart

20:34.966 --> 20:39.632
enough.

20:41.936 --> 20:50.067
But it was really, it was a great, it was one of the 
most pleasant things I've ever done. It

20:50.890 --> 20:56.256
needs to go about 10 seconds. This is now Monday, 
May 10, and we're resuming the interview. And

21:02.843 --> 21:18.800
Austin Curley has been trying to summarize in his 
thoughts the A&M method, the A&M philosophy, the

21:02.843 --> 21:18.800
A&M technique of relating to students. Please go 
ahead. Well, the important characteristic of

21:21.282 --> 21:41.705
Texas A&M College and University has always been 
that peculiar but effective relationship

21:21.282 --> 21:41.705
between professors and students.

21:42.346 --> 21:47.492
From the beginning, the academic element of the 
university was the deciding factor in what

21:48.063 --> 21:56.674
direction that the college would go. In its early 
days, all the way through,

21:57.375 --> 22:14.897
Dean Dean, a distinguished professor that's on 
our campus, thinks that is the most remarkable

21:57.375 --> 22:14.897
thing in the world about the relationship of 
students with their profs. Now, did you encounter

22:20.048 --> 22:22.171
that as a student? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Reflect and 
reminisce on some examples. Well, one of the

22:27.557 --> 22:34.505
professors that had a great impact on me was Count 
Segar. Count Segar was a short man, stocky, short

22:36.187 --> 22:45.137
arms, which he waved vigorously when he was trying 
to make a point. And he was indeed of royal birth. He

22:49.896 --> 23:04.425
came out of the central Europe, the area where 
there's so much turmoil now, and apparently his

22:49.896 --> 23:04.425
noble family had to leave. How in the world he got 
from the East Coast and the Ivy Colleges down to

23:04.827 --> 23:15.602
Texas A&M, I was too modest to ask him. But he was 
beloved by students.

23:22.011 --> 23:23.713
He enjoyed students. He took interest in them.

23:28.900 --> 23:32.505
He was not immune from

23:34.105 --> 23:36.969
cutting up with the students sometimes. I 
remember one time we were having class and this

23:37.610 --> 23:46.464
student was taking issue with him over something. 
And he said, Count, it's right here in this book.

23:51.591 --> 23:58.782
And the Count said, where did you get that book? Oh, 
he says, so and so. He said, throw the book out the

24:02.793 --> 24:06.658
window. Well, the old boy did. Out she went. Well, 
everyone looked startled, including the Count,

24:09.902 --> 24:16.911
and then we all had a big laugh. At the end of a 
course, Count Sigard would have you write a

24:16.931 --> 24:26.503
summary of your reaction to the task. You're free 
to write anything that you want to. Then he would

24:31.531 --> 24:38.801
take them up and he would read them aloud to the 
class. It was no threat to him. One fellow said,

24:40.743 --> 24:47.232
this is the biggest bunch of bullshit I've ever 
heard. Count looked up and said, you know, that may

24:48.053 --> 24:52.138
be true. And of course everyone laughed. But he, 
but on the other hand though, you could go to him

24:55.089 --> 25:06.384
with a serious problem and Council Guard was very, 
very gracious. Other examples? Other people?

25:08.387 --> 25:19.982
Well, I was very fortunate in the fall of 1938, my 
senior year, to get into the class of a Dr. Geddes.

25:21.177 --> 25:26.582
who was the first distinguished professor on our 
campus. And he had come down from the east. And he

25:30.266 --> 25:33.950
was indeed a remarkable man. Tall fellow. Family 
history of his family in Texas for a long time. And

25:42.858 --> 25:46.442
it was just remarkable. to sit there and listen to 
someone with the background that he had. When I

25:55.970 --> 26:03.240
looked at the schedule of classes for the spring 
semester of my senior year, he was teaching two

25:55.970 --> 26:03.240
courses. I signed up for both of them. One was oil 
and gas lease laws. That didn't bother me. I didn't

26:13.315 --> 26:16.800
know what I'd do with it, but I would get to hear him. 
And I talked to him. I visited with him a lot. Well,

26:21.227 --> 26:23.850
we all had. We liked our professors. We didn't 
hesitate to attach names to them.

26:34.825 --> 26:43.277
Dr. Gammon was noted as Oster Joe. And that was not 
meant in disrespect, but it was related to his

26:44.590 --> 26:53.389
mannerism of clearing his throat. And that was so 
remarkable that Dean Dean is trying to write a book

26:54.692 --> 27:04.894
about this. Now, Haskell, I think he needs to think 
through that very carefully, because you see,

27:05.330 --> 27:23.986
when we talk about something that happened 50 
years ago, we have to ask ourselves that this is a

27:05.330 --> 27:23.986
propitious time for that to come about. But in all 
of the history of Texas A&M College and

27:24.847 --> 27:35.016
University, there has been this tight bond And 
most of the years that I can attest to, the

27:36.076 --> 27:47.309
professor had a sincere interest in the students. 
Now when you were an undergraduate, There were

27:51.382 --> 27:54.045
still lots of faculty living on campus. Oh, yes, 
yes. Where the Memorial Student Center is now was

27:57.549 --> 28:10.884
two rows of homes that swept around to the 
playground. Then also back up around Walton Hall,

28:10.904 --> 28:16.731
there was a large group. There are people who grew 
up on the campus in those halls. I remember when we

28:22.785 --> 28:30.738
got up here in 59, there were still a few of the 
houses standing where the coldest parking garage

28:22.785 --> 28:30.738
is now. An English faculty member, Dick,

28:31.098 --> 28:44.119
he bought one of the last ones and moved it down to 
South Edge College Station. I don't think anyone

28:45.078 --> 28:50.644
was living in them in 59, but still two or three of 
the houses were still there. Did that encourage

28:50.684 --> 28:55.309
closer faculty-student relations? Yes, it did. I 
remember the dean of the College of Medicine,

28:57.011 --> 29:14.730
Veterinary Medicine,

28:57.011 --> 29:14.730
he would work late and he would come across the 
campus, the Veterinary Medicine building was

28:57.011 --> 29:14.730
right past the old academic building, and Dean 
Francis. Dean Francis, small man, but he would

29:22.082 --> 29:35.855
walk right by Hart Hall, go right across the 
street, and invariably we would be marching to the

29:22.082 --> 29:35.855
evening meal. Dean Francis made no point, and 
there would be frantic halts We let the dean by, and

29:43.583 --> 29:47.488
then we would go on. It was a great thing.

29:57.362 --> 30:03.951
I think that even the ROTC officers caught this 
spirit of thing. Well,

30:04.011 --> 30:09.338
it was good. This same spirit I saw in 1952 when I 
came back. These professors were interested in

30:16.442 --> 30:22.389
their students. They would volunteer to serve as 
faculty advisors. They would work to go over the

30:27.335 --> 30:34.102
test scores with them, help them with schedules, 
and all that sort of thing. And it was... To me, it

30:38.073 --> 31:01.144
was such a wonderful thing that in all of the 
contributions I could make to bring some current

30:38.073 --> 31:01.144
organization to really things that had taken 
place that we were able to do that we couldn't have

30:38.073 --> 31:01.144
before World War II. was well I don't know how it is 
now I'm not you know qualified but the it could be

31:01.934 --> 31:30.844
that among other things at school that it is this 
spirit and understanding and feeling that makes

31:01.934 --> 31:30.844
our student body like it is what are the let's let's 
Try to think philosophical. What are the events?
