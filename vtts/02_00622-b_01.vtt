WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:03.842
How did you meet Picard?

00:06.706 --> 00:27.937
Well, I met Picard when I was with O&R, and he had 
been invited to London to talk about the Baptist

00:06.706 --> 00:27.937
Captriest and to the scientific society. I guess 
it was the Royal Society of

00:34.709 --> 01:04.227
marine engineer or something like that, and so I 
made a habit of attending these various meetings

00:34.709 --> 01:04.227
of this type, and at that time I met him, and

00:34.709 --> 01:04.227
we had brief discussion after the meeting, and I 
asked him to join me the next next day, and we, at

00:34.709 --> 01:04.227
that time, we had lunch and talked over the whole 
plan and more or less developed this idea that this

00:34.709 --> 01:04.227
is something that I would attempt to try to to 
organize and sell this program to the Navy. And

01:08.877 --> 01:12.802
that's how it began. It involved working with 
people back in Washington and what we call Code

01:12.862 --> 01:26.820
416, Gordon Mill, Martin Maxwell, people like 
that who were in the oceanographic group there.

01:28.742 --> 01:31.986
And also at that time there was a symposium meeting 
in Washington and it was possible to fly Picard

01:34.193 --> 01:59.509
over and have him give his presentation in 
Washington and at this meeting we came up with a

01:34.193 --> 01:59.509
resolution this was a civilian meeting but about 
more or less oceanographic and Navy science and we

01:34.193 --> 01:59.509
passed a revolution which

02:00.417 --> 02:24.340
by this meaning that the Navy should get involved 
in the Bathyscaphe Trieste and in deep

02:00.417 --> 02:24.340
submergence, and this is more or less a resolution 
you could carry around and say, well, this group

02:00.417 --> 02:24.340
has favored this proposal, and you could talk to 
the higher brass, and who were generally

02:00.417 --> 02:24.340
receptive, but it's a matter of a lot of footwork 
and knowing people to get something moving. And

02:24.420 --> 02:29.445
mainly this seed money from ONR to get... Did you 
keep up with the Trieste after it was purchased by

02:30.472 --> 02:35.096
the Navy? Were you involved in any of its later 
activities? Well, I was involved to the point

02:39.200 --> 02:59.820
where it

02:39.200 --> 02:59.820
was

02:39.200 --> 02:59.820
transferred, purchased by the Navy, and shipped 
back to San Diego to the Navy Electronics

02:39.200 --> 02:59.820
Laboratory. And we had, at that time, we began 
these series of dives, testing and so forth, off

03:01.302 --> 03:11.713
San Diego. And it was my understanding that I would 
be the chief scientist in charge of this project.

03:21.364 --> 03:24.007
However, this didn't go in that direction. 
Eventually,

03:24.047 --> 03:29.993
I was somewhat delayed in getting back from When I 
came back to NAL, a person named Reckonser had been

03:31.357 --> 03:43.971
placed in charge of the project, and I was a 
consultant to the project, but I didn't really

03:31.357 --> 03:43.971
have control of it. I was involved with the 
project, but I didn't have quite the control that I

03:44.572 --> 03:50.478
wanted to have.

03:53.202 --> 04:00.790
But I was involved with the project through the 
time when we made the dive, a seven-mile dive in a

04:01.360 --> 04:08.751
Challenger Deep.

04:08.771 --> 04:14.500
So I was involved with the team, involved with the 
Challenger Deep dive. I guess most of this is

04:14.540 --> 04:22.772
probably described pretty well in that book that 
Picard and I wrote called Seven Miles Down. Right.

04:24.374 --> 04:30.203
Would you consider the Trieste your most 
important activity while you were at NEAL?

04:36.460 --> 04:48.935
Well,

04:36.460 --> 04:48.935
I wrote my first paper, I guess, on sea floor 
spreading at NEL. And I think my early ideas on

04:49.956 --> 05:02.451
continental drift and plate tectonics, what is 
now called plate tectonics, were perhaps more

04:49.956 --> 05:02.451
important. But certainly the deep submergence 
aspect was important because it was...

05:15.764 --> 05:20.748
It doesn't show up because there really aren't any 
publications from it except this book and a few

05:15.764 --> 05:20.748
papers. But so far as playing an important role, 
sort of being a catalyst and getting the Navy

05:20.828 --> 05:32.978
involved in deep submergence, I think that was a 
very important thing, the triage work. Describe

05:33.937 --> 05:39.643
how you came up with your theory of the formation of 
the Gulf of Mexico through rifting. You're

05:40.964 --> 05:45.409
speaking of seafloor spreading. Well,

05:45.709 --> 05:51.175
that's much later.

05:58.602 --> 06:03.167
Once this idea of what we now call plate tectonics 
was pretty well established in my in my mind. And it

06:04.925 --> 06:13.718
was

06:04.925 --> 06:13.718
pretty well made, obsolete all older models of 
global tectonics. And aside from the problems of

06:14.079 --> 06:26.637
the major dispersion of continents, there were 
the problems involved in the development of the

06:14.079 --> 06:26.637
Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. And any model you 
had, four of these The peripheral aspects of the

06:34.130 --> 07:03.276
breakup of Pangea had to be solved, and also they 
had to be solved in terms of plate tectonic rules,

06:34.130 --> 07:03.276
that you're permitted to have rifts and large 
shifts, which by older geology was not really

06:34.130 --> 07:03.276
allowable to move things in horizontal 
directions for great distances, and to explain

06:34.130 --> 07:03.276
things mainly in terms of rotation and drifting.

07:04.150 --> 07:13.823
Of course, the first person who took that great 
liberty in this sort of field was Maureen Carey in

07:04.150 --> 07:13.823
Tasmania in the late 1950s. And so once she more or 
less sort of broke this field, we all were involved

07:14.183 --> 07:33.229
in what are now regarded as sort of wild schemes to 
explain such things as the Gulf of Mexico, which

07:14.183 --> 07:33.229
apparently were these schemes we envisioned 
where certainly not quite correct, they were the

07:33.766 --> 07:39.832
right type of solution, were going in the right 
direction. And so we got answers which were not

07:40.913 --> 07:48.762
exactly correct, but more or less in the proper 
ballpark. When, as one of the early workers, if I

07:50.663 --> 07:57.951
may say so, with plate tectonics, When did you 
first begin to contemplate the possibility of

07:58.235 --> 08:04.326
continental drift and plate tectonics? Well, in 
the early days of marine geology, there were

08:05.808 --> 08:15.906
endless

08:05.808 --> 08:15.906
surprises. And these surprises were such things 
that the thickness of the ocean sediments was only

08:20.358 --> 08:28.590
one-tenth of what it should be if the ocean's 
basins were as old as the world. And the seamounts

08:30.573 --> 08:49.200
were not, when we dredged them, as we did on 
Operation High Jump with the work of Ed Hamilton,

08:30.573 --> 08:49.200
but we went out there with the intention of 
dredging the seamounts and dredging up fossils.

08:53.988 --> 09:08.427
Well, this was a rather a

08:53.988 --> 09:08.427
bizarre approach because you wouldn't think 
that, I mean, if you were flying through an

08:53.988 --> 09:08.427
airplane here, you wouldn't think of dropping a 
dredge in the ground and getting fossils you could

08:53.988 --> 09:08.427
recognize. But we thought we could do this. I mean, 
we thought there was sufficient rationale to do

09:10.950 --> 09:12.993
this. And in fact, we succeeded beautifully. We 
got a beautiful collection of macro fossils,

09:15.156 --> 09:20.082
resisted and so forth, too. demonstrate these 
geos were not pre-Cambrian, very ancient

09:20.770 --> 09:31.082
seamounts, as Harry Hess had supposed, but were 
indeed very young, Cretaceous.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.888
So this was, again, another surprise. And when you 
have enough surprises, you can't be surprised

09:36.328 --> 09:45.859
unless you have preconceived notion or 
preconceived model. If you have no ideas at all,

09:46.100 --> 09:48.162
then there are no surprises. But if you have ideas 
and they're wrong, then you're surprised by what

09:48.715 --> 09:54.701
you find. So when you have enough surprises, you 
begin to suspect the whole model. And in 52, then, I

09:59.947 --> 10:07.695
went to 53, I went to Japan for a year as a Fulbright 
Fellow. And I began to work on some of the results

10:08.856 --> 10:18.486
there in the Japanese Hydrographic Office, 
particularly on the Northwest Pacific region.

10:20.086 --> 10:30.920
the Japanese had developed this very nice 
hydrographic chart from their wartime data, and I

10:20.086 --> 10:30.920
revised this slightly and published it and tried 
to describe the whole northwest Pacific. Well, it

10:32.603 --> 10:47.342
became apparent to me that there was a certain 
hierarchy of features

10:32.603 --> 10:47.342
on the ocean floor, and in this hierarchy, the most 
important features, the number one, the dominant

10:32.603 --> 10:47.342
features, were well, first of all, the continents 
and ocean basins were the primary features in the

10:47.727 --> 10:51.792
world. But beyond that, then it was the trenches. 
The trenches transected everything else. Once

10:57.240 --> 11:01.165
you crossed a trench, you had a whole new type of 
geology. And so in thinking about this and looking

11:02.747 --> 11:15.945
at some of the seamount change, which appeared to 
be diving into the trenches, I just

11:02.747 --> 11:15.945
began to think that that under-threshing was 
taking place, and these seamounts were being

11:16.786 --> 11:24.178
consumed in the trenches, and this was a form of 
continental drift. So I went to a continental

11:25.280 --> 11:38.121
drift model, which I did then at that time in about 
1952, and I guess it became a bit apparent in my GSA

11:25.280 --> 11:38.121
paper in 1954. I didn't discuss continental drift 
as such. that I guess that's when I first became

11:44.731 --> 11:54.620
convinced of the reality of under-thrusting and 
drift on a small scale. It wasn't until later when

11:56.122 --> 12:13.118
we, after the mid-ocean ridges were recognized 
and the rift was recognized, when it became

11:56.122 --> 12:13.118
apparent that you had a model that would run if you 
generated no ocean floor in the mid-ocean rifts.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.616
And this was a conveyor belt thing. And this was a 
process which I termed seafloor spreading, which

12:17.656 --> 12:33.573
is a process which is now, the word is still 
retained, although it's not really a good

12:17.656 --> 12:33.573
description. I couldn't think of it. I didn't like 
that expression to begin with. I searched for

12:36.776 --> 12:42.582
something better.

12:43.338 --> 13:12.957
use that use that term and the concept of seafloor 
spreading is still

12:43.338 --> 13:12.957
uh of course it's still the term is still used

12:43.338 --> 13:12.957
uh so it's it's really in tokyo then in 53 when you 
begin to put all put the pattern together yes

12:43.338 --> 13:12.957
that's right now a tokyo experience is very 
interesting because i arrived there and i

12:43.338 --> 13:12.957
uh i did uh several things. I had the first scuba 
equipment in Japan. I arrived there with an

13:19.705 --> 13:22.529
underwater diving apparatus. I did a good deal of 
diving in various parts of Japan,

13:23.711 --> 13:40.176
including the pearl beds and some of the sacred 
fishing grounds. The Japanese had never seen

13:40.932 --> 13:47.078
self-contained breathing apparatus before, so 
this was quite a remarkable thing to them. Second

13:48.980 --> 14:09.842
thing I was concerned with in Japan is I, just 
before I went there, we had this Navy had installed

13:48.980 --> 14:09.842
this SOFAR system, experimentally, and we 
received some explosions on the hydrophones off

13:48.980 --> 14:09.842
California, and At that time, fishing boats had 
reported an eruption on San Benedicto Island in

14:10.447 --> 14:21.944
the Riviera Lajos off Mexico. And the

14:23.566 --> 14:35.323
fishermen had reported this, but of course you 
often see cloud plumes on tops of islands and there

14:23.566 --> 14:35.323
are often false reports of eruptions. There was 
sufficient evidence here to justify looking into

14:35.725 --> 14:44.697
it further, and I found at the same time these 
explosions had been arriving in the SOFAR system.

14:46.639 --> 14:56.252
And it turns out later that these SOFAR, these 
noises were not from Mexico, but were from Myojin

14:46.639 --> 14:56.252
Sho off Japan. They had traveled some 8,000 
kilometers beneath the sea, and they were

14:57.233 --> 15:04.483
shielded from the receiving station in Oahu, but 
they were received in these two stations off

15:05.189 --> 15:14.921
California at Puerto Narguero and I guess 
Mendocino, something like that. So we had a line of

15:15.021 --> 15:21.408
position because we could see eventually that 
these signals arrived from Japan. But in the

15:22.830 --> 15:33.002
meantime, this aroused sufficient interest in 
the eruptions off Mexico to justify trying to

15:22.830 --> 15:33.002
investigate that. And this is sort of an 
interesting exercise in trying to get something

15:34.214 --> 15:40.440
done. Because we tried to get the Coast Guard to fly 
down, and they were limited to flying 1,000 miles.

15:48.408 --> 15:51.030
This was 1,200 miles away, just beyond their 
limit. We couldn't get the Navy to act. The Navy

15:55.274 --> 16:03.462
wouldn't

15:55.274 --> 16:03.462
dispatch any flights, mainly because we had to go 
through channels. And we were not allowed to

16:04.488 --> 16:11.599
bypass, you know, we did all the time, but we were 
not supposed to bypass any channels. And when you

16:11.659 --> 16:21.854
go through channels, if you go through, say, four 
channels to reach some person, your chances of

16:11.659 --> 16:21.854
receiving a no answer go up each time. So it's sort 
of a geometric thing. The man right above you might

16:25.559 --> 16:28.183
say yes or no, but... If you go through this yes or no 
process four times, your chances are one to one to

16:28.940 --> 16:35.192
the fourth power, or two to the fourth power, or one 
to 16. So anyway, we couldn't get the Navy to act. So

16:41.984 --> 16:52.804
Gifford Ewing, at that time, he

16:41.984 --> 16:52.804
made a long distance call to the Navy, to the Air 
Force somewhere, and the Air Force had weather

16:53.780 --> 16:54.581
flights. And so although we were naval 
scientists, we got the Air Force to cooperate with

16:55.362 --> 17:07.319
us and get aboard and divert a weather 
reconnaissance flight to go down and see this

16:55.362 --> 17:07.319
alleged eruption. And sure enough, it was a major 
eruption. It was a new volcano being formed, which

17:09.281 --> 17:18.734
is a rather remarkable event on this island.

17:20.337 --> 17:22.740
And this was just before I went to Japan. It turned 
out later that these noises we heard were not from

17:23.564 --> 17:27.490
the sound, but were from Japan. So this became a 
major project with me while in Japan to

17:27.510 --> 17:47.884
investigate the Myojin Sho eruption and the 
underwater transmission of sound associated

17:27.510 --> 17:47.884
with that eruption, which was remarkable also 
because it involved the loss of a ship being blown

17:27.510 --> 17:47.884
up by this eruption. In fact, the scientist I was 
supposed to work with in Japan was lost. He was the

17:52.786 --> 17:59.395
chief scientist on the ship from the Hydrographic 
Office of Japan, which was sent down to

17:52.786 --> 17:59.395
investigate this eruption. And the entire ship 
disappeared from the world, including 31 chief

18:00.777 --> 18:11.032
scientists and 31 other people. And all that was 
found was a life preserver and a few planks which

18:11.152 --> 18:17.601
had embedded in them bits of volcanic rock. So the 
ship had been destroyed by a volcanic explosion.

18:22.603 --> 18:26.589
And on the SOFAR records, we had the explosion 
pinpointed. There was one explosion on, I guess it

18:27.210 --> 18:34.961
was September 23, 1952, at 1231 in the afternoon. 
And that is obviously the explosion that the ship

18:35.041 --> 18:38.106
got there. And this new island had sunk. And all 
there was, presumably, was discolored water. And

18:44.115 --> 18:45.477
they just went over the top of it. At that time, the 
The volcano rather than exploding every hour or

18:48.209 --> 18:53.096
so, it was maybe exploding once a day. It was in its 
dying, waning stages. But the ship went up into the

18:56.021 --> 19:00.367
discolored water and was blown up, engulfed by the 
explosion.

19:03.772 --> 19:06.737
And then it's after you leave Japan then that you go 
to London. Yes, I was back then in the West Coast for

19:07.398 --> 19:10.643
six months or so. Then I went to London from return 
to the New Electronics Laboratory. and then went

19:17.707 --> 19:20.051
to ONR London for four years. Okay, and then from 
London you come back to the NEL lab. Yes, that's

19:25.300 --> 19:26.001
right. Okay. And had there been any change in the 
emphasis of the work of the lab by the time you

19:27.263 --> 19:32.913
returned from London? Did they seem to be more 
mission-oriented than they had been before, if

19:32.933 --> 19:36.258
that were possible? They became perhaps more 
mission-oriented. They were...

19:46.293 --> 19:54.344
in a sense, but the Korean War was over, and during 
the Korean War time, of course, we were highly

19:46.293 --> 19:54.344
mission-oriented.

19:55.506 --> 20:15.895
But oceanography had a bit of a brighter, it was 
becoming sort of a darling science, and so it

19:55.506 --> 20:15.895
received more support, particularly the 
physical oceanography, but the field of marine

19:55.506 --> 20:15.895
geology and geophysics received, again, almost 
none. We really were not better off than before. It

20:19.032 --> 20:21.817
was a very minimal sort of support.

20:24.801 --> 20:33.996
We were the most visible group of oceanographers, 
I think, in the entire Navy because we were doing a

20:24.801 --> 20:33.996
lot of good work and publishing many papers.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.744
We had a very, very fine group in those days.

20:41.768 --> 20:43.992
Then in 1963, you go to NOAA. In 63, I left and went to 
Washington, that's right, to NOAA, which was then

20:45.338 --> 20:54.546
the Coast and Geodetic Survey. At that time, the 
Coast Survey, well, a few years prior, they had

20:56.568 --> 21:13.624
hired Harris Stewart, who's now our director 
here, and he had had a Ph.D. from Scripps and was

20:56.568 --> 21:13.624
also a student of Shepard's. and I guess he was 
their instrumental but the Coast Survey suddenly

21:14.718 --> 21:40.017
also became rather science-oriented for many 
years they were prior to that they were not and

21:14.718 --> 21:40.017
people in the Coast Survey who had did any any 
publication at all were few and far between there

21:14.718 --> 21:40.017
was Gibson and Jordan and these people just wrote 
their scientific papers at night they kind of did

21:41.178 --> 21:46.925
all this work, they weren't allowed to do any sort 
of scientific work in their normal mission. But

21:47.866 --> 22:08.552
this began to change in the late 50s, and

21:47.866 --> 22:08.552
then in the early 60s, the Coast Survey organized 
what they, what was called a, it was sort of a

21:47.866 --> 22:08.552
scientific staff, which was supposed to, which 
had as a mission to do scientific work. basic

22:10.304 --> 22:11.565
research. We were sort of a consulting staff. And I 
was asked by Stuart to come and join that group, and

22:15.230 --> 22:19.295
so I did at that time. This

22:19.375 --> 22:30.408
was beginning of sort of the scientific 
involvement of the... The co-survey was very

22:30.548 --> 22:35.253
hidebound, very traditional organization. And 
they were

22:42.721 --> 22:57.939
by law, they could not investigate, they only 
could investigate the continental shelf by

22:42.721 --> 22:57.939
congressional terms of reference. And this is 
partly a matter, I guess, of jealousy between

22:58.259 --> 23:03.946
services as to who does what. Now the world was 
divided up between the hydrographic office and

23:04.026 --> 23:07.150
the co-survey. And the co-survey, extended their 
mission a little bit. They defined the shelf as

23:14.943 --> 23:21.913
extending to 2,000 fathoms, so they could at least 
investigate the continental slope. But their

23:23.615 --> 23:33.109
main mission was making hydrographic surveys, 
and they didn't really bother to even contour up

23:23.615 --> 23:33.109
their boat sheets. And this is what, for example, 
Sherford was doing in the early days. He was taking

23:36.614 --> 23:37.896
this basic data. And, well, for many years, the 
close survey ran lines of sounding across the Gulf

23:42.273 --> 23:57.932
of Alaska and

23:42.273 --> 23:57.932
up to the Alaskan region for some 20 years or so, and 
they had these lines of soundings, but it remained

23:42.273 --> 23:57.932
for Bill Menard and I to make a bathymetric map. 
They didn't ever bother to make a bathymetric map

23:57.952 --> 24:09.546
of their deep sea data, so they had this single 
mission of of collecting soundings and making

24:10.353 --> 24:15.939
nautical charts, but not extending their work 
beyond that.

24:20.604 --> 24:22.226
Is NOAA too big or too small? NOAA?

24:26.631 --> 24:34.399
Well,

24:26.631 --> 24:34.399
it's a little hard to say. We're, of course, 
something called the environmental research

24:41.605 --> 24:45.489
laboratories, of which we are one of perhaps a 
dozen. And I saw something a few years ago

24:47.331 --> 25:03.669
indicating there were something over 600, 700 
scientists,

24:47.331 --> 25:03.669
people who were labeled as

24:47.331 --> 25:03.669
in one way or another being in the scientific 
category. Now I suppose that number might be close

25:04.110 --> 25:08.415
to 1,000, a bit more even. No, it's not too big. I

25:11.795 --> 25:22.270
guess everyone has their ideas about how things 
should be organized or reorganized.

25:26.376 --> 25:37.853
I think from where I sit in the field of marine 
geology, we think that the, well, we think in the

25:26.376 --> 25:37.853
NOAA, the ocean side of NOAA has been not 
emphasized enough. It's the National Oceanic and

25:40.062 --> 25:45.770
Atmospheric Administration, but it's mainly 
become a super weather bureau. The weather, the

25:45.810 --> 25:50.317
meteorology part is much more important than the 
oceanic part. And the main, of course,

25:50.337 --> 25:58.570
laboratories in oceanography are this 
laboratory, the main one, plus a smaller group in

25:50.337 --> 25:58.570
Seattle. And even within the oceanography, we 
really don't do the things that I wish we had or

26:07.195 --> 26:11.661
could do that's involved in deep ocean. And we're 
doing almost nothing in the deep ocean. And

26:17.047 --> 26:31.906
for many years, we were sort of more or less 
competing with the geological survey to be the

26:17.047 --> 26:31.906
lead agency for the government in marine geology 
and geophysics. And I think mainly by... lack of

26:36.980 --> 27:06.312
funding, lack of action, the U.S. National Survey 
has moved into that role, which perhaps is what it

26:36.980 --> 27:06.312
should be, but we always hoped that we would, since 
we do have many things in our favor, we have an

26:36.980 --> 27:06.312
officer corps and we have the ships, and we have 
ships which have ocean keeping and deep sea

26:36.980 --> 27:06.312
capabilities, we feel it should be involved in 
deep sea missions which are proper for the types of

27:07.608 --> 27:09.271
ships we have. We have, say, Class I oceanographic 
vessels. The only program we have going now is

27:12.959 --> 27:23.862
Peter Rona's program in marine geology on the 
Mid-Atlantic Raids, the TAG program.
