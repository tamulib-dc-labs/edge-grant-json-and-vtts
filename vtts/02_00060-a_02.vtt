00:02.697 --> 00:09.784
On that first semester, did you have some teachers 
that you realize now were important?

00:14.869 --> 00:17.211
Yeah, I mean, I had an odd collection.

00:19.914 --> 00:23.758
My English teacher was quite good, and I don't 
remember his name. My second semester, I had C.K.

00:27.782 --> 00:30.164
Weston, and that was an experience. Describe the 
Well, he was crazy. I mean, he told all these

00:36.704 --> 00:42.934
stories about growing up in a house of ill repute, 
being raised by prostitutes. And all of his

00:43.635 --> 00:48.883
examples and things were sort of built around 
this. And he would get a little loud. Of course, he

00:52.027 --> 00:53.730
was an actor by his own, I guess, ambition. And so he 
acted out in the classroom a lot. Would tell dirty

01:03.910 --> 01:07.395
stories that would curl your hair today. 
Fortunately, there were no women at the time. It

01:10.019 --> 01:11.421
didn't make any difference. And then we, along the 
way, figured out, of course, that he was the voice

01:12.362 --> 01:20.154
of Kyle Field, which helped explain it a bit. But 
Esten was a real character. freshman math

01:24.743 --> 01:29.949
teacher, algebra teacher, who was a fifth year 
senior. He was a brilliant guy, but very confused.

01:34.835 --> 01:37.758
He would wear his corps uniform with a cowboy belt 
and buckle. Or he would wear civilian clothes with

01:38.419 --> 01:42.404
his corps belt and shoes. And he was still going 
through the ROTC program because he had to finish,

01:42.464 --> 01:49.452
I guess he probably started there. But he was an odd 
duck. A fellow named Doug With was a teacher that

01:52.216 --> 02:04.573
took Animal Science 107 that freshman year, who's 
now dead, was a very high quality teacher.

02:04.994 --> 02:13.826
Probably had been an ag teacher or a 4-H leader or 
something, and has been very involved in

02:04.994 --> 02:13.826
livestock youth programs. And he was a good 
teacher. Chemistry was a guy named,

02:18.693 --> 02:24.485
gee, I can't remember his name. What I remember 
about him was we had Chemistry 101 at old chemistry

02:25.287 --> 02:34.626
lecture hall, probably seat 300 kids. And if you 
happen to doze off, he would throw a piece of chalk

02:34.910 --> 02:39.419
at you. And a friend of mine named Andy Combs could 
never stay awake, and he sat in the next. And you

02:44.350 --> 02:45.332
drew chairs. They assigned you by numbers to the 
chairs. So I had to stay alert, because I knew there

02:48.138 --> 02:51.825
was going to be a piece of chalk coming at me. 
Targeted for Andy, but he wasn't that accurate.

02:56.408 --> 03:01.375
But I mean, I can't imagine today either, a 
professor standing at the front of the room. Of

03:01.395 --> 03:02.837
course, they probably don't have chalk anymore. 
They're teaching with PowerPoint. As you got into

03:06.062 --> 03:16.917
the academic program, what did you realize were 
the unwritten rules about going to class and so

03:06.062 --> 03:16.917
forth? Well, in those days, if you were a 
distinguished student, you were exempt from

03:18.459 --> 03:24.728
class. Now, that sounds like a strange concept. 
But it was very coveted because you did have other

03:28.952 --> 03:33.978
things that frequently got in the way. So back to my 
earlier point, one of the good things about being a

03:34.018 --> 03:43.309
distinguished student the first semester is that 
I had some choices the second semester. What you

03:45.332 --> 03:49.637
figured out, though, is even if you were comatose, 
you better be in that class. They were keeping

03:51.019 --> 03:52.200
score. Oh, I remember the fellow's name in 
chemistry. I think his name was Doc Little.

04:03.161 --> 04:07.146
We had chemistry lab at 1 o'clock on Friday 
afternoon. That was one of the bad parts about

04:07.687 --> 04:12.492
someone else doing my schedule. But when we had a 
pop quiz, he would come in the window. He would be on

04:19.059 --> 04:20.601
the ledge. of the chemistry building, come in the 
window and throw chicken feathers in the room. And

04:25.625 --> 04:28.690
Love just had a great time with this. And by the way, 
that was canceled in November because as I walked

04:30.152 --> 04:48.259
from Duncan Dining Hall back to my dorm room to get 
my chemistry lab stuff, a fellow came to the end of

04:30.152 --> 04:48.259
dorm seven yelling, the president has been shot. 
And I looked back, and I was a freshman, and I looked

04:48.239 --> 04:53.444
at the guy, and I said, don't joke about something 
like that. And he said, no joke. Went back, turned

04:55.466 --> 05:03.694
that little phonograph Victrola thing on, had a 
radio in it, sure enough, and learned that he had

04:55.466 --> 05:03.694
been shot. What other, let's center on that. What 
did you and your buddies think about that event,

05:08.038 --> 05:15.065
and what did you all do that night, and so forth? You 
know, it's interesting.

05:19.188 --> 05:29.157
Thinking back on it, I had very much the same 
sensation that I had with the bonfire event this

05:19.188 --> 05:29.157
year, in that there was this huge tragedy. You were 
helpless and uncertain about what was going on.

05:35.002 --> 05:45.992
And frankly, in those days, it was worse than that, 
because you didn't know if it might be some kind of

05:35.002 --> 05:45.992
conspiracy or attack against the country. It was 
really very much unknown. So we sat around in our

05:49.175 --> 05:55.793
rooms with each other in sort of groups and talked 
about what was going on. And then it happened, I

05:56.875 --> 06:01.969
guess, on must have been Monday or Tuesday, I don't 
remember, bonfire was canceled. It was partially

06:09.562 --> 06:12.165
built, but not completely. And I remember going to 
meeting a high school friend of mine who was going

06:13.026 --> 06:30.707
to UT and went to Austin and spent the night with him 
and his, I think, sister just to get away and sort of

06:13.026 --> 06:30.707
regroup and try to figure out what was going on. And 
then the game was played. It was a great ball game.

06:35.972 --> 06:39.216
In fact, Texas was the national champion that 
year. We beat them in Kyle Field, but the refs gave

06:39.316 --> 06:42.179
them seven points. And we failed to pull it off. But 
why I know we beat them was I was sitting where the,

06:48.485 --> 06:55.733
if you remember where the old horseshoe in Kyle 
Field was, there was a entrance for the band to

06:55.848 --> 06:58.832
march through. I was the first guy on the first row 
next to that with a date,

06:58.852 --> 07:20.659
Fish Harned's sister from Fort Worth, when I saw 
Jim Willenborg catch the intercept pass in the end

06:58.852 --> 07:20.659
zone and slide out of the end zone on his knees, and 
they called him out of bounds. So I had a front row

07:20.679 --> 07:24.724
seat to record this. Back to getting broken into 
the core, describe the routine for a fish in the

07:24.704 --> 07:33.859
dining hall. This is in Duncan. You're in the new 
area. Well, you know, interestingly, the dorms

07:39.769 --> 07:42.493
were Compared to where I was living at home, they 
were quite nice. I mean, they were brick. They had

07:48.954 --> 07:52.680
concrete floors, which were waxed. We had 
concrete floors. Still steam heated with no air

07:56.065 --> 07:59.610
conditioning. But they were Spartan, but they 
were OK. The dining hall was a horrible disaster.

08:11.069 --> 08:15.018
One of the problems in those days was you could 
never get enough to eat. I mean, this was a... This

08:17.590 --> 08:26.221
was a period when we went through with what I 
consider probably A&M was having trouble getting

08:17.590 --> 08:26.221
anyone to come here. So among the group, you got a 
lot of sadists signed up. And for whatever reason,

08:31.127 --> 08:42.242
the dining hall became a place where the 
harassment level was high, and intimidation was

08:31.127 --> 08:42.242
high, and it wasn't a lot of fun. Now, the other 
thing is we had yell practice two nights a week. uh

08:46.193 --> 09:09.096
it was tradition quote that c1 and d1 be on the front 
row of kyle field on the 50-yard line with their

08:46.193 --> 09:09.096
guidons next to each other which meant you marched 
in you stood at attention you had the prayer you sat

08:46.193 --> 09:09.096
down you drank one glass of milk You had the 
announcements and you left. So two nights a week,

09:12.522 --> 09:19.739
you got nothing to eat other than you might be able 
to slosh down a little milk. By the way, another

09:19.759 --> 09:23.828
part of the yell practice routine was that They 
moved the yell practice from the Grove to Kyle

09:24.044 --> 09:32.935
Field, maybe the previous fall or maybe that fall. 
And we're standing on the front row, me and my fish

09:32.955 --> 09:36.900
buddy have the guide on. And this guy comes walking 
down the track, waving and shouting and saying

09:38.162 --> 09:50.878
hello to everybody, throwing bags of popcorn up 
into the, and you know, you're supposed to be

09:38.162 --> 09:50.878
standing at attention. And the fellow was sort of 
chubby, balding, round-faced. And my official

09:58.110 --> 10:01.678
lady leans over to me and says, who is that? And I 
said, I think it's President Rutter. Well, it was

10:05.894 --> 10:06.735
Lupo. And Lupo was out, of course, drumming up 
business among the good ol' eggs. And I'll never

10:13.963 --> 10:16.345
forget that mistake that I made. President 
Rutter, fortunately, never knew it. But back to

10:19.309 --> 10:32.543
the dining hall, if you weren't doing Hot Corner, 
which was through the family-style system where

10:19.309 --> 10:32.543
the meals came to, Or you were a, this is a word that 
can't be used in contemporary terms, but it

10:32.877 --> 10:54.885
started with an N, and it was the person that served 
the junior or senior at that table, that you were

10:32.877 --> 10:54.885
his N.

10:32.877 --> 10:54.885
And those two were sort of specific assignments. 
And then the rest of the time you were just getting

10:54.865 --> 10:58.570
harassed. Now the good advantage was if you could 
find a time when you didn't have a class after chow,

10:59.111 --> 11:10.247
you could hang around until everybody else 
departed in a meal hound. You had to endure a lot to

11:11.228 --> 11:13.852
get there, but you did. It was one of the ways you got 
food. There were a lot of little playful things

11:16.499 --> 11:19.423
that went on. You often got an assignment to crawl 
through a few tables and light someone's bib.

11:25.993 --> 11:28.617
You've probably heard of this little deal. Or we 
had a few other games, like we played a game called

11:28.637 --> 11:36.448
Cal. And you'd have two freshmen across from each 
other, each who would try to take an entire bottle

11:36.428 --> 11:51.323
of, at that time, cream-reproduced milk, put it in 
their mouths, and then stare at each other while

11:36.428 --> 11:51.323
the upperclassmen told them jokes. And then 
whoever, of course, broke first, spit the milk on

11:52.745 --> 11:57.009
the other guy. And it was really not, it was great 
fun, if you think about it. And then there were

12:01.842 --> 12:07.871
routines about you had to know all this 
campusology so people would ask you questions.

12:07.951 --> 12:11.476
And you got to eat if you answered them and you 
didn't if you didn't. Were those called Cush

12:11.496 --> 12:13.239
questions? Well, Cush questions were for 
dessert. Oh, but there were just of these? There

12:18.066 --> 12:20.610
was campusology questions throughout. And of 
course you had to call all the food by its proper

12:20.590 --> 12:26.259
name, which I had trouble remembering. I wasn't a 
very good freshman. What I figured out early on,

12:28.963 --> 12:38.498
which I think was sort of the standard way of 
surviving, was two things. One is it was a game, and

12:38.779 --> 12:44.067
you had to understand it was a game if you got real 
serious about it. you were in trouble. And the

12:45.954 --> 12:50.942
second was you had the only friends you had were 
your fish buddies. You'd occasionally find an

12:52.684 --> 13:02.639
upperclassman who would befriend you, drop 
handles and was sort of a place to escape to. But it

13:02.699 --> 13:03.861
was rare. The fish buddies, it was a Darwinian 
existence that you survived through your

13:04.735 --> 13:12.465
freshman friends. And you found ways to answer 
back through those freshman friends. So

13:18.233 --> 13:22.418
everybody knew that the game was being played that 
way. Do you remember any retaliation that you and

13:22.438 --> 13:28.887
your fish buddies wreaked on some people? Yeah, 
there were a few popular methods, all handed down

13:29.845 --> 13:38.480
in terms of the methodology. The favorite thing 
was drowning out.

13:45.286 --> 13:52.052
I never did understand why the rule was such, but 
you couldn't lock your doors at night, even if you

13:45.286 --> 13:52.052
were an upperclassman. And so, but the old doors in 
the, in those dorms, if you, what you would do is you

13:52.072 --> 14:15.073
would vee the, you would open the main door and the 
other closet door and they veed together the

13:52.072 --> 14:15.073
doorknobs hooked and it provided a airway path 
through the room. And I guess the reason they

14:16.657 --> 14:20.022
didn't lock them was because they couldn't stand 
the heat. But what you do is you'd fill a, they had

14:20.963 --> 14:26.190
old plastic trash cans, probably 50-gallon trash 
cans. And you would fill that pretty much with

14:27.051 --> 14:29.374
water. And then you would go into an 
upperclassman's room and two guys or three guys,

14:29.775 --> 14:40.350
and you would wash them right out of the bed with 
that 50-gallon can of water. We had one, we had a

14:40.790 --> 14:44.335
sophomore frog came in at mid-semester his 
sophomore year, and our assignment given to us by

14:44.990 --> 14:56.087
the sophomore class was to drown him out every 
night his spring semester. So we dutifully had to

14:56.107 --> 15:03.859
get somebody assigned to, and it was sort of like 
after a while it got to be a joke because he knew it

14:56.107 --> 15:03.859
was coming. literally every night. Now, they 
finally called it off after a while, but this got to

15:08.210 --> 15:13.176
be pretty tortuous for everybody. In hindsight, 
was he a bad egg? Did he deserve this kind? Well, he

15:17.000 --> 15:25.650
was a frog sophomore, so he hadn't gone through the 
same experience they'd gone through, and so they

15:17.000 --> 15:25.650
considered this sort of a duty. As it turned out, he 
was sort of a different kind of fellow, but not that

15:26.612 --> 15:32.158
different. And the assignment came from his 
classmates? His classmates. The sophomores?

15:37.095 --> 15:38.359
Right. We got another assignment which in a way was 
sort of tragic. We had two juniors who were in a bit

15:42.601 --> 15:46.326
of a pitched battle. And one of them was the first 
sergeant. And we got the assignment of taking the

15:49.952 --> 15:55.079
first sergeant, putting him in a mattress cover. 
Our mattresses had cotton covers that tied back in

15:55.279 --> 16:03.411
those days for sanitation purposes, I assume. 
Took him out of his bed, put him in the mattress

16:03.644 --> 16:14.331
cover, took him out to the site now where Kruger 
Dunn Aston Mosier is, was then a drill area. Took a

16:14.952 --> 16:20.927
logging chain, attached it to the sack, and tied 
him up into an oak tree. And then we all go back to our

16:22.696 --> 16:31.108
dorm and try to go back to sleep, of course, with 
your heart going 90 miles an hour. What I remember

16:31.929 --> 16:37.076
is the sound of the chain clanking as it came up the 
stairs. And then the next thing I knew, you had all

16:38.838 --> 16:43.084
the freshmen up in the hallway. And we were doing 
something called manual of arms with our foot

16:44.313 --> 16:47.603
lockers. Now, you know what manual of arms is. Boy, 
when you're doing right shoulder, left shoulder,

16:51.514 --> 16:57.732
present arms, try imagining doing that with a full 
foot lock. And this is probably, by this time, it's

16:59.011 --> 17:10.066
1 or 2 in the morning, and our CO, Charlie Fisher, 
comes out and finds all this going on and shuts it

16:59.011 --> 17:10.066
down. And as a result, both Parker, the first 
sergeant, and this other junior were kicked out of

17:10.106 --> 17:16.054
the Corps. And one of them might have even been 
kicked out of school. I can't remember. This was

17:23.345 --> 17:24.788
not an unusual event. I mean, this is a pretty 
standard event. It's just that it got elevated to

17:26.771 --> 17:31.018
the point where there was a feud, and we were in the 
middle of it. So that the footlocker was... A

17:31.159 --> 17:34.805
little like a rifle. That was too severe, the 
footlocker routine. Oh, yeah. But the drowning

17:37.970 --> 17:39.754
out... No, no, that's okay. That was okay. Yeah. 
And there were Babbo bombs, which I'm sure you've

17:42.118 --> 17:46.365
heard of, which... Bevel bombs were fine as long as 
you took the metal ends out. See, bevel cans had

17:52.587 --> 17:55.971
aluminum or metal. And what you learned was you 
take that out and you put ankle tape, basically, on

17:56.831 --> 18:02.157
the ends of the can. The best ones were the ones that 
were hooked up to a cherry bomb, hooked up to the

18:02.517 --> 18:10.605
light switch so that you had it hooked to the room. 
And then when they flipped the switch, it blew up

18:10.625 --> 18:17.432
and went all over the room. but one of the best 
things that we did though in retaliation paid

18:17.412 --> 18:41.277
dearly for it but uh our our co as i said was sort of a 
gentle fellow and he decided that he didn't really

18:17.412 --> 18:41.277
want to work on the bonfire and this was in those 
days you built a bonfire in roughly 10 days as soon

18:17.412 --> 18:41.277
as the rice game ended which was always the week 
before UT.

18:47.389 --> 18:50.474
If it was here, after the game, you immediately 
went to the cut site. If it was in Houston, you drove

18:50.895 --> 18:55.522
back and went to work at the cut site the next day. 
Well, anyway, Fisher decided that he was a senior

18:56.424 --> 19:03.535
and he was tired of bonfire and he was going to go 
home to Cuero for the weekend. At the time, they

19:03.515 --> 19:06.940
were building what's now the president's home. 
And there was plenty of brick and sand and mortar

19:08.061 --> 19:14.831
available. And we had some rather ingenious 
freshmen in the outfit. And we managed to lug over

19:19.217 --> 19:27.549
there enough brick, sand, and mortar to mortar up 
Charlie Fisher's door from the inside. And it was

19:29.051 --> 19:31.294
on the fourth floor. Byron Watts who was the 
ringleader of this had a grappling hook and a rope

19:31.274 --> 19:57.113
so that he could get down to the co-conspirators 
upperclassmen on the third floor corner room and

19:31.274 --> 19:57.113
get out after he had finished the brick job so when 
Charlie comes back on Sunday evening from Cuero to

19:31.274 --> 19:57.113
get in his room he puts his key in the old metal door 
and lock and pushes and nothing happens And no

19:57.835 --> 20:05.726
matter what he does, and of course the hinges are on 
the inside, this thing is, it's literally like a

19:57.835 --> 20:05.726
castle moat. There's no way to get in it. The 
physical plant people had to finally come over,

20:07.749 --> 20:13.276
and I think they just had to break the door down. I 
don't even remember how they got in. I just know

20:16.841 --> 20:20.526
that we had a great time with that little event. And 
no one got kicked out for that? Oh, no. No, that was

20:22.769 --> 20:23.770
just good bull. And did anyone admit... to any 
authority as to who? Only years later.

20:35.104 --> 20:35.565
Let's see.

20:38.769 --> 20:40.331
Describe the bonfire routine. You said you all 
came back from the rice game and started. How far

20:44.336 --> 20:46.678
away was the cut area? Do you remember? Don't 
really remember. I would say probably It was

20:51.110 --> 20:54.476
probably five, 10 miles, something like that. We 
would leave the dorm, go to Duncan Field, get on

20:55.257 --> 21:03.872
flatbed trucks in the middle of what seemed like 
the middle of the night. And those trucks would

21:03.892 --> 21:06.076
haul us out to the cut site. And then we, our outfit 
responsibility was at the cut site, and then we

21:06.397 --> 21:12.848
were the final guards of the bonfire, right before 
it was lighted. That's all changed through time.

21:19.437 --> 21:22.140
Did you and your buddies, did you all cut logs? No, 
only upperclassmen could either use a chainsaw or

21:23.041 --> 21:27.267
an ax. Freshmen were just grunts. We cut logs. what 
were known as F-sticks. And these were oak

21:37.113 --> 21:51.293
saplings, probably three or four inches in 
diameter, and then long enough to get a log in the

21:37.113 --> 21:51.293
middle and three freshman on each side. And you 
lined the sticks up, rolled the log on it, and then

21:52.114 --> 21:59.263
through just sheer, I mean, I can imagine how the 
pyramids were built. That's how you built. the

22:00.365 --> 22:01.888
bonfire. And then you would haul it to the truck, 
the three kids on the truck side would stick the

22:01.908 --> 22:15.555
sticks on the bed, duck under, come out, and then 
the three on the other side would roll it on and

22:01.908 --> 22:15.555
there you went until you got the trucks loaded. And 
as far as you were aware, this routine was copied

22:15.535 --> 22:22.268
from the previous years. And as far as you know, 
what injuries were there, if any, that year? Nicks

22:32.347 --> 22:37.898
and cuts and exhaustion and classes missed and 
that's it. i you know i think i've reflected on this

22:37.878 --> 23:07.497
a lot and it's not the purpose of the uh of the 
discussion but there were a couple of things one

22:37.878 --> 23:07.497
was it was the the core chain of command uh was 
although there was a lot of horseplay and

22:37.878 --> 23:07.497
craziness at the end of the day the one thing that 
was emphasized was safety and procedure and you

22:37.878 --> 23:07.497
know you you did you did things and if you screwed up 
you were still in that chain of command. I mean, it

23:09.370 --> 23:10.371
could be dealt with. It was not a sort of a separate 
student organization without that kind of core

23:10.931 --> 23:18.680
discipline and attention. The other thing was 
that we tended to specialize. Certain corps

23:24.206 --> 23:26.709
outfits were responsible for certain things. 
What I remember is the band was at the site

23:31.861 --> 23:34.025
offloading. And then there were engineering 
outfits responsible for actually doing the

23:34.286 --> 23:38.394
stack. There was very little, almost nobody on the 
stack. I mean, it was rare for anybody to be up top.

23:47.813 --> 23:49.937
What they typically did was go up there do some 
topping out and cleaning up but but most of the

23:49.917 --> 24:14.777
stack work was done by tilting the logs up from the 
bottom and building out in a teepee form so you

23:49.917 --> 24:14.777
didn't have the kids exposed like they were and 
this was on the drill field or Duncan field Duncan

23:49.917 --> 24:14.777
field and it already moved over there right and as 
far as you recall about how many stacks high

23:49.917 --> 24:14.777
there's only one stack I mean, how many stacks? I 
don't know. It all looked like a big Indian teepee.

24:21.146 --> 24:25.893
And the tops of each log were not cut off exactly 
like a... No. It was very roughly formed, which

24:25.913 --> 24:34.926
probably, you know, helped its stability because 
everything tended to be intertwined and

24:25.913 --> 24:34.926
interlocking. And it was, you know, a lot has been 
made about the 1969 bonfire being the tallest

24:35.075 --> 24:41.903
ever. If you look at it, it's tall only because 
there's a long center pole and a few sticks at the

24:41.923 --> 24:53.658
top, but it was really pretty symptomatic of the 
bonfires of the time. It was mostly a lean-to kind

24:53.738 --> 24:57.302
of teepee formation. so y'all worked about uh 
let's see you worked on it but that bonfire was not

24:57.282 --> 25:14.312
burned was not burned we worked on it for i guess a 
week through the weekend prior to well that's not

24:57.282 --> 25:14.312
right kennedy was killed on friday so it was it was 
friday that we stopped work and it was that

25:14.292 --> 25:42.797
saturday and sunday that i went to austin and then 
of course they announced that the and do you

25:14.292 --> 25:42.797
remember i don't what happened to those logs the 
public was invited to come and take whatever they

25:14.292 --> 25:42.797
wanted that's right there was no and then i guess 
somebody physical plant probably cleaned it up

25:14.292 --> 25:42.797
when it was all over but Another interesting 
thing, I went back to the game. You remember the old

25:47.206 --> 25:53.980
tradition that if we beat University of Texas on 
Thanksgiving, we got Monday off. Well, we didn't

25:55.403 --> 26:00.533
beat them, but Rudder gave us Monday off and we all 
thought he was a hero. because of the way that we

26:00.513 --> 26:03.943
were treated by the referees. Your mention of 
President Rutter, when do you first recall seeing

26:04.244 --> 26:14.775
him or having any interaction with him as a 
student? You know, I mean, I knew he was the

26:15.953 --> 26:24.527
president as a freshman, and I probably, you know, 
there were some, I remember a Guyon Hall event

26:15.953 --> 26:24.527
early in our time. It was the old Guyon Hall, when 
you look left and look right, you know, and half of

26:25.048 --> 26:29.736
you are going to be gone speech. And I think Rudder 
was probably at that speech, but he was sort of a

26:30.638 --> 26:39.312
distant icon, and I didn't really know anything 
about him. He was, Rutter was a guy that frankly

26:40.658 --> 26:46.607
didn't have a lot of personality. I mean he was a 
strong-willed, firm, resolute sort of fellow

26:46.727 --> 27:00.287
who, I mean he had some good humor about him, don't 
misunderstand me, but I couldn't see it as a young

26:46.727 --> 27:00.287
student. Probably my first real exposure came to 
him through the student senate. We had a student

27:06.801 --> 27:18.968
senate, I was on the student senate, and he would 
meet with us occasionally, especially on

27:06.801 --> 27:18.968
controversial issues, and we had a few in our day. 
We had a faculty member in veterinary medicine

27:18.948 --> 27:30.983
that was

27:18.948 --> 27:30.983
fired, I guess, would be the proper way. A tenured 
faculty member, in fact. And Rutter was the guy who

27:34.227 --> 27:36.730
made the decision. And of course, the faculty were 
all over him to the degree that they could in those

27:36.810 --> 27:41.036
days. And the student newspaper was all over him. 
And a friend of mine, this was actually, I guess,

27:43.619 --> 27:48.465
our senior, fall of our senior year. A friend of 
mine named Tommy DeFrank was the editor of the

27:49.745 --> 27:57.465
battalion and Tommy took Rutter on and Rutter told 
him, you know, one more article, Tommy, and you're

27:49.745 --> 27:57.465
gone. Tommy, citing First Amendment rights, took 
one more shot at it and sure enough he was gone. And

28:05.455 --> 28:14.231
so we had a little controversy surrounding all 
that, but probably my sophomore or junior year

28:05.455 --> 28:14.231
through the Student Senate would have been the 
first real. Now in those days the Student Senate

28:15.032 --> 28:20.422
met in a small second floor room in the MSC. There 
were probably I don't know, 20, 25 people, whereas

28:23.427 --> 28:32.538
today it's hundreds, you know, and that's sort of 
become the English Parliament. But in those days

28:32.558 --> 28:36.042
it was small because the place was small. That 
freshman year, did you go on court trips? Yes.

28:43.311 --> 28:44.693
Describe that. I probably shouldn't.

28:49.852 --> 28:55.636
The first one I remember going to was to the Rice 
Corps trip in Houston. And a couple of buddies of

28:55.656 --> 29:09.668
mine, one in my outfit and one that was a high school 
friend from Trent, Texas, the Trent Gorillas, was

28:55.656 --> 29:09.668
the other person. And I guess there were four of us, 
because we couldn't afford to get one. And we got a

29:12.831 --> 29:15.253
room in the old Rice Hotel downtown. And we got 
someone to buy some booze for us. And after the

29:20.859 --> 29:37.618
game, which I'm sure we lost, I can't remember, but 
pretty sure we did, we went back to the room and

29:20.859 --> 29:37.618
boozed it up and had a good time and made the 
downtown streets of Houston along with a lot of

29:20.859 --> 29:37.618
other ne'er-do-wells. The thing I remember most 
was there were tiebacks on the curtains in the old

29:38.118 --> 29:43.384
rooms. that were made much resembling a crapper 
cord, you know, that you wore in the corps. So we

29:52.199 --> 29:59.972
absconded with those curtain pullbacks and 
decided they would be our crapper cords as

29:52.199 --> 29:59.972
freshmen in the corps. And years later, I came 
across that thing in some stuff my mother had kept.

30:07.603 --> 30:10.807
She probably thought it was for real. You didn't 
have a date on that? Did not have a date. What about

30:13.571 --> 30:15.794
the Dallas or Fort Worth? We had a great time in 
Dallas because I had a friend named Sarah Lee Moyer

30:16.735 --> 30:23.325
who I went to high school with who had gone to North 
Texas. And our court trip that year was to Fort

30:24.266 --> 30:28.592
Worth. And I had called Sara Lee to see if she might 
know of some girls at North Texas that would be

30:29.095 --> 30:35.403
interested in a date. Well, she said, I think so. 
And so we all head up there. And she's arranged, I

30:40.870 --> 30:46.257
don't know, probably eight or 10 kids to have 
dates. They were gorgeous little girls.

30:50.102 --> 30:51.524
Everybody had a great time. We just had a ball. And 
everything was fine. until our sophomore year

30:55.268 --> 31:04.422
when we went to the Corps trip in Dallas, at which 
time I had people lining up at my door saying, hey,

30:55.268 --> 31:04.422
you think we could do this again? Well, I did. And 
Sarah Lee complied. But what she failed to tell me

31:08.929 --> 31:13.816
was this was the same weekend as North Texas 
homecoming. So the quality of the dates went

31:18.623 --> 31:22.274
downhill just a little from the first year to the 
next. So I wasn't nearly as popular the second time

31:22.294 --> 31:28.212
around as I was the first.
