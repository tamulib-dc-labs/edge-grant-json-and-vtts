00:03.220 --> 00:16.718
Yeah, I think the Woodlands has done 
extraordinarily well in continuing to develop

00:03.220 --> 00:16.718
along the objectives that were set, not even in 
1974 when it opened, but in the late 60s. That's a

00:18.360 --> 00:23.467
long period of time to stay true to an ideal. In 
fact, when HUD terminated, it had to do an

00:25.570 --> 00:32.299
environmental impact statement that was 
required by law. And one of the findings it had to

00:35.821 --> 00:51.104
make was whether the public interest would be 
protected or at least well served by that federal

00:35.821 --> 00:51.104
action of their getting out of the program. And 
since they had invested public monies in the

00:52.286 --> 01:03.703
woodlands and the grants and whatnot that we 
talked about, they had to make a finding as to what

01:04.679 --> 01:15.916
that the woodlands would continue to develop 
along the lines where, as opposed to the developer

01:04.679 --> 01:15.916
going off and abandoning the concept. And it is a 
record in that environmental impact statement

01:15.936 --> 01:30.538
and the findings that I've made that the woodlands

01:15.936 --> 01:30.538
was going to continue. The developer was 
committed to it, to the plan, And that

01:34.582 --> 01:51.380
irrespective of the federal involvement, the 
Woodlands is going to continue to develop as it had

01:34.582 --> 01:51.380
set out to do, which coincidentally is the same 
thing that we're saying to the residents today in

01:34.582 --> 01:51.380
dealing with transition. Just because we're 
going to create another association doesn't mean

01:51.440 --> 01:56.145
that we're going to change the pattern of 
development. People are saying to us, we bought

01:56.165 --> 02:01.711
here, our biggest investment in our lives is the 
house. We bought here. because of what the

02:03.505 --> 02:05.287
Woodlands is. And we don't want to see that change. 
And we're saying, we're not changing that. In

02:09.931 --> 02:20.520
fact, the reason that we're creating the other 
association is so that we can control the

02:09.931 --> 02:20.520
Development Standards Committee ourselves to 
make sure that we can continue to develop like

02:09.931 --> 02:20.520
this. But anyway, HUD made that finding. I think 
over time, there are going to be a lot of pressures

02:24.604 --> 02:33.512
on the Woodlands,

02:24.604 --> 02:33.512
which might cause some people within the 
Development Corporation to question whether we

02:34.353 --> 02:44.826
should continue developing like this. There have 
been pressures in the past. And certainly the

02:47.829 --> 03:00.765
presence of Mr. Mitchell is going to make sure that 
we don't deviate from the straight and narrow, so

02:47.829 --> 03:00.765
to speak. But I think over time, since this is a 
long-term project, there will be pressures if Mr.

03:01.842 --> 03:13.217
Mitchell retires and other people come to the 
helm. In my mind, as an employee and as a resident,

03:13.277 --> 03:25.673
you've got to wonder if the next person sitting in 
his seat will have the same commitment to the ideal

03:26.260 --> 03:28.323
that he has. I hope that person does. We are

03:32.649 --> 03:42.022
a unique project, certainly in this part of the 
country and one of only several in the nation. We

03:44.466 --> 03:49.212
have shown that it can be done and can be done 
profitably. I know one of Mr. Mitchell's

03:51.691 --> 04:00.521
objectives in going into this program was to be a 
demonstration project and hope that others would

03:51.691 --> 04:00.521
emulate what we're doing. I think we have 
influenced other developments in the Houston

04:02.743 --> 04:11.673
area to be done on a master plan basis. But the 
future for all of us is uncertain.

04:19.096 --> 04:24.221
I think that a public company needs to look at 
bottom-line profit. There's always pressure to

04:24.261 --> 04:33.852
do that, and building these kinds of projects is 
not the most profitable type of real estate

04:24.261 --> 04:33.852
development that one can go into. There's an awful 
lot of overhead. There's an awful lot of overhead.

04:37.576 --> 04:42.741
There's a lot of front-end, a lot of capital costs 
that need to... accounting terms be capitalized,

04:43.295 --> 04:49.083
and the realization of the profits on those is down 
the road. So I think it will be a challenge for

04:50.305 --> 05:02.162
Mitchell Energy and Development over the years as 
to whether it wants to continue with this

04:50.305 --> 05:02.162
development. All of us hope that it will, and hope 
that Mr. Mitchell's successors have the same

05:02.383 --> 05:12.357
commitment that he has. That, to me, is, you know, I 
think we've done a splendid job to date, and I think

05:12.758 --> 05:19.508
we'll continue to do a good job. But there's an 
uncertainty in my mind. That's where it lays. You

05:24.775 --> 05:25.516
don't perceive it. One of the things I've picked 
up, or I think I have, is that there's a profound

05:25.576 --> 05:37.954
commitment among the executives we've talked to 
to the ideals that Mr. Mitchell espouses. That's

05:37.994 --> 05:40.858
one of the reasons why I gather they're here. Yeah, 
there isn't an executive in this company who

05:41.480 --> 05:47.490
couldn't be making more money someplace else, 
guaranteed.

05:50.174 --> 06:04.737
But the combination of professional challenge 
and excitement from working on this kind of

05:50.174 --> 06:04.737
project, together with being able to live in this 
environment, is what keeps people here. It's very

06:04.757 --> 06:06.981
fulfilling. And as I say, depending on who 
succeeds Mr. Mitchell, I dearly hope that, I

06:08.210 --> 06:20.462
probably shouldn't be talking, Mitchell will 
probably outlast me, but he's that kind of guy. But

06:21.283 --> 06:29.291
this is a long-term project, and realistically we 
have to anticipate that. And I hope the corporate

06:29.311 --> 06:36.478
commitment is as profound as you say. as it is 
embodied in the one man. Certainly people who work

06:41.970 --> 06:47.258
for the Woodlands Corporation share that. This is 
something completely aside. Most of the

06:50.022 --> 06:52.666
Woodlands Corporation people we've talked to 
live here in the woodlands. How prevalent is that

06:53.327 --> 06:58.074
with the energy company? Do you know a percentage 
of the people over there across the street that

06:58.114 --> 07:04.744
live in the woodlands? I don't know 
percentage-wise, but, and again, I don't know of

07:05.247 --> 07:16.024
too many people over there, but of the people that I 
know in energy, in corporate, virtually all of

07:05.247 --> 07:16.024
them . So there is probably, I mean, it would seem to 
me a resident is going to be much more interested in

07:16.044 --> 07:22.054
the community. Oh, yeah. In fact, after fashion, I 
adopted a policy, an urgent policy for the

07:22.915 --> 07:31.609
community association board that the 
CORPORATION APPOINTED PEOPLE HAD TO BE WOODLANDS

07:32.281 --> 07:36.246
RESIDENTS ALSO. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED, YOU'D BE 
SURPRISED AT THE DIFFERENT AWARENESS LEVELS AND

07:37.527 --> 07:48.280
SENSITIVITIES OF THE PEOPLE SERVING ON THAT 
BOARD. THERE'S ONE GENTLEMAN WHO

07:48.821 --> 08:01.056
LIVED ON 1960 IN THE 1960 AREA FOR A LONG WHILE AND 
SERVED ON THE BOARD.

08:01.610 --> 08:05.279
When he moved to the woodlands, he became radical. 
I had to calm him down.

08:09.589 --> 08:15.182
A residential perspective causes you to make 
different decisions. But I would dare say a large

08:16.365 --> 08:20.074
percentage of the energy people. living in the 
woodlands, most of the ones that I'm familiar with

08:20.425 --> 08:25.072
do. Because it was obvious that may be one of the 
enduring strengths of the corporations, the fact

08:25.092 --> 08:37.591
that people have bought into the dream, the 
vision, whatever you want to call it, and they live

08:25.092 --> 08:37.591
it out. Are you inadvertently, intimately 
involved in, say, recruitment of industry to the

08:37.611 --> 08:47.766
woodlands, or the job? I know this is a matter of 
some concern, promoting new jobs, new

08:48.033 --> 08:56.601
opportunities. Only tangentially. If an 
industry is looking at coming to the woodlands,

08:58.963 --> 09:16.200
then because of my work with the county, if they're 
looking for tax abatement, I might get involved.

09:16.754 --> 09:31.750
If they're very, they're almost always 
interested in education, and I'm the principal

09:16.754 --> 09:31.750
contact person with the school district and also 
serve on the board of the John Cooper School, the

09:16.754 --> 09:31.750
private school there. So if education's 
important, I'll help put whatever package, that

09:31.770 --> 09:39.959
part of that package together. And if they want tax 
abatement, then I'll introduce that notion to the

09:40.279 --> 09:45.985
community association. to see if they want to get 
tax paid. But I'm not out recruiting industry or

09:51.050 --> 09:54.513
anything like that. I just thought you might get 
quickly looped into being where you are. Which

09:59.138 --> 09:59.939
brings up another issue. Were you involved in the 
efforts to bring University of Houston up here?

10:04.324 --> 10:05.064
No, not really. Oh, OK. Because of this kind of 
continuing issue, we chased around the block a

10:07.667 --> 10:15.195
couple of times, but never really got a tag on them. 
No. The gentleman who's most directly involved

10:17.553 --> 10:22.403
with that is David Gottlieb. We're going to talk to 
him. David was with the University of Houston.

10:28.175 --> 10:30.320
They came to work for us about four years ago. And 
he's been on both sides of that fence, so he might

10:31.442 --> 10:36.913
probe him on that.
