If you're familiar with what the hell it is to go to a football game, now it's a freshman, don't you?

00:12.259 --> 00:12.619
Mm-hmm.

00:12.639 --> 00:15.061
You know, they always get paired up in some softball.

00:17.904 --> 00:23.509
They're encouraging you to yell your guts out and all that kind of stuff.

00:23.529 --> 00:25.011
Well, we finally figured that out, what we'd do.

00:25.031 --> 00:35.320
We'd march in over there, my roommate and I. We'd just turn around and walk back through the crowd and come back and get in a sack over at Hart Hall and listen to it on the radio.

00:36.717 --> 00:46.065
and then by the time the game is over, we get the uniform back on, go out, meet everyone coming back and say, yeah, we'll get them next time.

00:46.085 --> 00:49.848
But you finally just learn how to make big circles around that undesirable stuff.

00:51.390 --> 01:02.279
All right, let's make believe now that somebody gives you a very, very large check.

01:02.299 --> 01:06.623
And the only condition is you've got to give it to Texas A&M

01:07.767 --> 01:17.361
for the benefit of whatever is your favorite or are your favorite causes, purposes, what would it be?

01:18.062 --> 01:20.226
What do you care most about at A&M now?

01:23.611 --> 01:26.235
That too is a hard one.

01:26.255 --> 01:34.467
It's real easy to say the library because it becomes sort of an archival place where you sort of feel like it's sort of a repository where

01:35.273 --> 01:38.757
Things could be kept on a little bit of a permanent basis.

01:39.438 --> 01:43.924
If you give money to the administration, you fear they'll just be squandered on something.

01:44.965 --> 01:47.869
There's no trail left behind on what became of the money.

01:48.529 --> 01:53.896
You might just hire some other administrator to come in and suck up all the money.

01:54.417 --> 01:59.863
So I think everyone who gives a contribution sort of likes to feel like it's something of lasting value.

02:00.544 --> 02:03.728
And in this question, you can specify what it is.

02:04.636 --> 02:09.302
That's why I say sort of the library sort of thing.

02:09.322 --> 02:19.013
And I think A&M falls way short in recognizing his past and his heritage like it should.

02:19.074 --> 02:23.519
And I think that's why so many of the old-timers do support the library.

02:23.639 --> 02:30.608
It's sort of like to feel like there's a place where you have something that could be developed and they've expanded some.

02:30.768 --> 02:33.411
I think Colonel Sam

02:34.117 --> 02:43.869
not Colonel, I want to say Colonel Chicken, Sam Houston Sanders gave some money to the Corps Center, and I think that's sort of a step in the right direction.

02:43.909 --> 02:47.794
I'm not sure exactly how that building is used.

02:47.814 --> 02:56.545
I don't understand its philosophy very much, but having a place like that where some memories could be shared and kept and shown is fine.

02:56.625 --> 02:58.808
I think the next thing people want to say, well, if

02:59.024 --> 03:03.690
It'd really be nice to have some money to give some to a bunch of students who are really hardship students.

03:03.710 --> 03:06.013
But there are so many programs now for hardship students.

03:06.033 --> 03:10.099
I don't know if you really need much in addition to that.

03:10.119 --> 03:21.814
And it's a very hard thing to figure out because the university usually will want to go toward kids that have real good grades as opposed to real good kids.

03:22.856 --> 03:23.637
All right, last thing.

03:24.518 --> 03:27.782
What feelings do you hold in your heart for A&M today?

03:31.137 --> 03:37.873
I feel very fortunate to have gone and been a part of A&M as a student and as a faculty member and always will.
