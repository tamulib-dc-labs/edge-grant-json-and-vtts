00:02.849 --> 00:06.395
Did you and your colleagues think the NM Library was improving?

00:06.455 --> 00:08.699
Did you think we were making progress, getting better?

00:09.000 --> 00:10.001
It was getting better.

00:10.662 --> 00:11.985
We were building collections.

00:12.285 --> 00:13.587
Our budget was improving.

00:14.569 --> 00:20.479
The people, we were still taking great pride in what we were doing.

00:21.601 --> 00:23.184
And I don't mean just the library.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.486
I mean, everybody had

00:25.208 --> 00:48.027
pride in what we were representing the university uh and let's see now uh you moved away from northgate uh i'll bet somewhere along in there didn't you not really really when i came back from lsu i got a apartment on cross street across the church from the lutheran church okay

00:48.327 --> 00:56.964
And I lived there until I got married in 72 and moved into Bryan then.

00:58.146 --> 01:06.623
What did library professionals do in the 60s and 70s for fun, for enjoyment, after work hours?

01:08.459 --> 01:11.324
Personally, back during those times, I was going to school.

01:12.866 --> 01:20.519
And I know they had, it seemed like maybe we had more social things together as a group.

01:21.721 --> 01:22.763
Describe those.

01:23.043 --> 01:23.745
What were those?

01:23.765 --> 01:26.129
You might have a picnic, library-wide picnic.

01:26.709 --> 01:30.636
And when you had a library-wide picnic, everybody came.

01:32.050 --> 01:35.584
Families, spouses, it was just family.

01:36.970 --> 01:42.010
And I think today's time has changed the togetherness.

01:42.513 --> 01:47.138
Did most of the people live, most of the professionals live in the Bryan College Station area?

01:47.158 --> 01:47.939
Most of them did.

01:47.959 --> 01:57.068
During the time when I first came, a lot of the professors, because I know I wrote and asked when I came back from LSU, there was campus housing.

01:57.949 --> 02:02.974
Most of the campus housing was for graduate students, and you had to be a married graduate student.

02:03.615 --> 02:05.817
But there were some houses for professors.

02:06.558 --> 02:06.698
Mm-hmm.

02:07.150 --> 02:10.396
And some of the professors actually lived on campus.

02:11.698 --> 02:15.806
But it was, I don't know, what's the word in it?

02:16.086 --> 02:19.012
Not cohesive, but everybody was just, everybody was family.

02:19.913 --> 02:23.640
Where now everybody goes in their different directions.

02:23.620 --> 02:49.965
And I know back in those days we did not have a staff association, but if someone in the library got sick or died or someone in their family was in the hospital or died, there would be an announcement made and everybody contributed to a fund, whether it was to buy flowers or cards or food or whatever.

02:50.806 --> 03:18.407
for them, and I know if something happened, and I know they still do things like this, but I know one of our librarians' sons was burned very badly, and Hung Chi Yu, and his sons were burned very badly, and so there was an outpouring from the library community as well as other people on campus for aid for one of their own, taking care of our own.

03:19.448 --> 03:20.610
And during that era, did

03:21.299 --> 03:34.130
you librarians have other library, university libraries with whom y'all were kind of looking at as fellow travelers, others you made comparisons with?

03:35.513 --> 03:39.342
I think we always did the ARL

03:39.743 --> 04:07.287
statistics and tried to find libraries with like size or like collections land-grant colleges we tried to make sure that we were on the and we were always on the leading cutting edge we're not doing that as much now we were one of the first group to really get the automation and the computers and technology and we had been we were noted for being

04:07.790 --> 04:10.317
the leading edge in that.

04:10.658 --> 04:12.684
Describe how that came about.

04:13.406 --> 04:19.183
I know we started with VRS after dark with some of the search engines, which was, we had

04:20.227 --> 04:25.874
mediated searches where people came in and paid to have a literature search done for them.

04:26.374 --> 04:38.448
And we still have people coming back to school for post-doctorate work or that have been here before, maybe some of the old ags that are retired and that come back.

04:38.528 --> 04:47.879
I remember when I was a graduate student, you could hire somebody to do the literature search and we would do it.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.082
And the professors had an account

04:50.821 --> 04:55.707
with their budget and a librarian had to do the searching of the literature for them.

04:55.787 --> 04:57.810
Where nowadays it's a do it yourself.

04:58.811 --> 04:59.833
And we have a lot more.

05:00.954 --> 05:03.998
But this was something new and innovative.

05:04.759 --> 05:13.150
And we took poster sessions where it was just like a, we had a bulletin board type deal and we would publish what we were doing

05:13.585 --> 05:16.970
at national conferences and give talks on what we were doing.

05:17.651 --> 05:21.617
And people would come and study and see how we were doing it, how successful it was.

05:22.178 --> 05:26.304
And a lot of them were based, the schools were based on what we were doing.

05:27.186 --> 05:39.264
And we served as a, prototype is not the word, but there would be a company that was trying to develop some software, develop a search engine or something.

05:39.745 --> 05:41.888
And A&M was the one that they would

05:42.509 --> 05:56.473
asked to test out what they were doing and ask us for our recommendations to make it better, what to cancel, what not to do, and what to do, how to make it easier for the people to use it.

05:56.493 --> 05:58.958
Why did they call on A&M, do you think?

05:58.978 --> 06:01.562
I think because we had an interest in doing that.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.285
We were going to grow.

06:04.177 --> 06:08.822
And we didn't have the funding that University of Texas did.

06:08.842 --> 06:17.570
And in those days, there was probably a greater rivalry with the University of Texas and A&M than there is now.

06:18.872 --> 06:20.573
And they had a bigger library budget.

06:20.693 --> 06:22.095
They had more of the Puff Fund.

06:23.056 --> 06:28.281
And so we were the second child, so to speak, in funding.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.403
Because our budget,

06:30.974 --> 06:37.122
was mostly the state mandated, whatever the legislature did, that was our budget.

06:37.963 --> 06:43.790
Where University of Texas had other funds that they were able to build their collections with that we did not have.

06:44.651 --> 06:49.797
And we were trying to compete with them, to pass them.

06:50.298 --> 06:57.707
What was it like to shift everything in the library to computers and high tech?

06:58.582 --> 07:12.688
We had and we still have some that I don't like all that newfangled stuff but now more and more people are liking the computers because the professors can do it at their office.

07:12.708 --> 07:14.171
The students can do it at home.

07:14.231 --> 07:19.982
They can do it at their dorm and not have necessarily have to come in and they can

07:21.076 --> 07:23.939
Like the little kid learning to walk or learning to do this.

07:23.959 --> 07:24.980
I can do it myself.

07:25.081 --> 07:26.022
I do it myself.

07:26.702 --> 07:28.404
And they like that.

07:29.225 --> 07:35.412
But there are some that still want, we still have a few retired professors that come in.

07:35.432 --> 07:42.220
There's one named Lee comes in all the time and he says, I just don't understand all this newfangled stuff and I need this.

07:42.280 --> 07:42.961
Find it for me.

07:44.463 --> 07:46.886
And he gets real upset if you can't find it for him.

07:47.726 --> 07:49.148
But usually we can.

07:49.228 --> 07:50.830
And we'll try to show them how.

07:51.215 --> 07:54.999
And then there's, of course, the ones that you can show and they don't want to do it.

07:55.019 --> 07:56.221
And they'll say, well, show me again.

07:56.261 --> 07:59.344
They've got their whole list of things to find it.

07:59.885 --> 08:09.776
But now, as everything was shifted to high tech, it meant literally that every item in the library had to be handled.

08:10.757 --> 08:11.138
Right.

08:13.180 --> 08:14.742
Sometimes recatalogued.

08:14.958 --> 08:16.241
Some of it was recatalogued.

08:16.341 --> 08:27.263
Everything had a, not a barcode and such, but some kind of what we call OCR label, which is kind of like a social security number put into every book and entered in.

08:28.205 --> 08:31.532
One thing with our size that

08:31.512 --> 08:38.262
I wish we could have a special funding for is an inventory of what we have.

08:39.323 --> 08:44.090
Because Louis Bauer, an English department, used to come in every summer.

08:44.130 --> 08:54.685
He didn't work a full summer in the English department, but in the summers, I mean year for the English department, but in the summers he would do an inventory of the library materials.

08:54.665 --> 08:58.591
So we had a better idea of what was coming up missing.

09:00.414 --> 09:10.469
And when we did put these OCR labels in, we did a pretty much inventory then because every book had to be handled to have them stuck into.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.213
Nowadays, as they're going to different

09:13.632 --> 09:25.971
means of checking out as the book comes in if it doesn't have the new code attached to it it's being put on there as it goes out so that's kind of a

09:26.592 --> 09:36.427
In all of your experience, have we ever had any major losses, either theft or fire or flood?

09:36.528 --> 09:38.270
We've had several major losses.

09:38.390 --> 09:46.423
I know there was one time period, I know it was the early 70s, late 60s, that time period, where

09:47.247 --> 09:51.170
in these old stacks, old cushion stacks and eight floors.

09:51.190 --> 09:59.518
The windows had no bars or screens and they were opened in the summer for ventilation.

10:00.699 --> 10:07.004
And there was a guys in some pickup trucks backed up and they were just throwing the books out into the trucks.

10:07.445 --> 10:13.610
I don't know where they were taking them, whether they were taking them to sell or just what they were doing, but a lot of them were recovered.

10:14.811 --> 10:16.933
There was a time period when

10:18.027 --> 10:25.582
We had a good patent collection, and now the patents are kept under lock and key because we have all the patents.

10:26.524 --> 10:27.025
We're a U.S.

10:27.045 --> 10:31.294
depository, but whole sections of the patents

10:31.848 --> 10:34.391
And it was happening all over the United States.

10:34.912 --> 10:44.363
This group would go in and say they were going for patent number, X to whatever number, they got them from A&M and from another place they got another set.

10:44.383 --> 10:46.285
So they were building their own collection.

10:47.346 --> 11:00.842
Some of them were, I think, I hate to say the Russians, they were building a collection and others, but these patents were being stolen and sold and a lot of them were recovered.

11:01.649 --> 11:12.464
We have, or we had a lot of books, older books in the stacks that had a lot of plates in them that people would go in and cut the plates out and sell those.

11:14.206 --> 11:28.045
For example, we didn't have any of the Audubon plates, but a lot of the older, rare books, somebody would know what they were looking for and go in and cut the plates out.

11:28.531 --> 11:31.315
You have no idea what era this was?

11:31.335 --> 11:32.816
In the 70s, 60s and 70s.

11:34.118 --> 11:40.506
Has a thief ever been, a notable thief ever been caught in the NM Library?

11:41.327 --> 11:44.211
They caught some of the ones that were doing with the patents, but I don't know.

11:44.231 --> 11:45.793
Right, they caught them.

11:45.813 --> 11:47.215
And they weren't students, I presume?

11:47.235 --> 11:47.395
No.

11:47.595 --> 11:48.677
These were pros.

11:48.957 --> 11:49.638
These were pros.

11:50.359 --> 11:52.461
All these that were going out were pros.

11:53.102 --> 11:55.365
And one of the ones that...

11:55.700 --> 11:58.863
was stealing a lot of our rare books and plates and all that.

11:58.883 --> 12:04.168
He was also doing that at University of Texas and other major libraries around the United States.

12:04.248 --> 12:17.221
And I'm not sure where it was that he finally got caught, but when they searched his belongings, they found things with our A&M College stamp on them.

12:18.101 --> 12:23.867
Now, in your years, we never had a fire or a flood or a building collapse to cause damage, did we?

12:24.438 --> 12:28.924
A lot of times when it would rain, the basement area would flood.

12:30.145 --> 12:36.634
And also we had the emergency plastic rolls to cover books in the Evans Library.

12:36.654 --> 12:45.605
And I think when they renovated this time and built on the annex, a lot of this leakage was taken care of.

12:45.645 --> 12:51.252
But we were always having, you know, at night having a water main break or something.

12:51.933 --> 12:52.774
And I know...

12:54.779 --> 13:03.993
About eight years ago, there was a lot of pipes broke in the basement of the cushion building for the wildlife and fisheries collection.

13:04.014 --> 13:06.021
It flooded that collection.

13:06.423 --> 13:19.024
And it was bad on us because not only did they lose so many of the specimens for the wildlife collection, but all the formaldehyde smell was seeping into this, especially into the Cushing Building.

13:19.424 --> 13:26.035
And if you had a study carol in the Cushing Building, you really couldn't use it until they got rid of all the formaldehyde smell.

13:26.015 --> 13:32.106
But we never lost anything like that was a priceless, one-of-a-kind.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.971
Not that I know of.

13:35.071 --> 13:37.516
I can't think of anything we ever lost like that.

13:37.536 --> 13:38.317
All right, let's see.

13:39.540 --> 13:43.447
Dyke was the library director, and then who comes after him?

13:44.308 --> 13:45.871
Jim Smith, I believe.

13:46.152 --> 13:46.993
Describe him.

13:47.176 --> 13:51.021
Well, he was a local boy that made good, I guess you would say.

13:51.502 --> 13:57.270
And he was here, and he also built into the humanities and social sciences.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.934
And he went on to SUNY New York.

14:02.116 --> 14:06.081
And he, like I said, the library was growing.

14:06.422 --> 14:13.251
And he was getting, in this era, they were encouraging the librarians to go to meetings.

14:14.041 --> 14:16.766
I personally fell in a catch-22.

14:16.826 --> 14:23.659
When I first came here, the only people that go to the professional members were the administrative staff.

14:24.561 --> 14:26.164
The others did not get to go.

14:26.204 --> 14:29.370
So I didn't get to go to those.

14:29.891 --> 14:33.518
And then there was a time period where they were letting the newest members

14:34.831 --> 14:36.013
staff members go.

14:36.493 --> 14:42.402
Well, by that time, I was not considered new, so I didn't get funding to go then.

14:42.482 --> 14:46.207
You were either administrator or one of the newest ones.

14:46.227 --> 14:57.683
And then later on, Jim Smith, Jack Smith, not Jim Smith, Jack Smith kept encouraging and he wanted us to get involved in state

14:58.237 --> 15:21.578
national programs and during the 70s and 80s it being involved with the state organization was very important now it's not so much not so many people in the library are involved with the Texas Library Association I'm one of the ones that have been in it since the year one in fact I have a real low

15:21.777 --> 15:24.901
Texas Library Association membership number, I think I'm number 624.

15:24.941 --> 15:30.788
And there's something like over 7,000 members now.

15:31.048 --> 15:44.304
So I'm on a committee and I found out that the Reference Roundtable started in 1964 in Texas Library Association and I've been a member of the Reference Deposit Section since 1964 when it first started.

15:45.085 --> 15:49.270
But now people are getting more involved in national.

15:49.975 --> 15:54.542
And even now, the trend is not so much even going to the meetings.

15:55.223 --> 16:04.476
Some are involved in international, but the professional meeting seems to be losing its draw.

16:04.516 --> 16:09.624
Not draw, but it's not counting as much for the ones in the library.

16:10.325 --> 16:18.677
Now that we've gone, we have professional status, and being members of organizations was very important, and now it seems like everybody does their own thing.

16:18.757 --> 16:19.138
It's not.

16:19.456 --> 16:20.878
It's not as important now.

16:21.599 --> 16:39.727
Our travel budget in the library has never been like the travel budget for other departments on campus, because I have friends that are just in the classified staff area and other departments, and they're encouraged to go to meetings, and their entire way is paid.

16:39.887 --> 16:46.898
All their hotel, their meals, there's everything else, and in the library, for example, this year,

16:47.840 --> 16:49.343
each librarian was given $730.

16:49.643 --> 17:02.187
An airfare loan to Chicago or San Francisco or Washington DC can wipe out that and if you're a member of these organizations, you're expected to go to your

17:02.892 --> 17:08.405
annual meeting, your semi-annual meeting, as well as other meetings and other meetings too.

17:09.407 --> 17:16.724
And the state only allows you $70 per DEM and no hotel room nowadays can you find at $70.

17:16.904 --> 17:22.116
So the librarians double, triple, even five in a room just to go.

17:22.552 --> 17:33.067
and you find the cheapest right, and you take the red-eye special to the meetings because that's all the budget that we're allowed, but yet our people still go.

17:33.107 --> 17:45.784
And that's been a bone of contention all along, and it hasn't, the budget has not grown that much for us to go, but yet they're expecting us to go.

17:47.687 --> 17:52.153
Evelyn King, one of our assistant directors, did start a

17:53.382 --> 18:02.931
not a scholarship fund, but a fund to add to professional development for the librarians to help aid in some of this.

18:03.872 --> 18:11.480
So, but it's still not the total amount of, like I said, this past year, the last two years.

18:12.701 --> 18:16.825
After Jack Smith, does Irene Hoagley come then?

18:16.845 --> 18:17.986
No, Henry Allsmeyer.

18:18.006 --> 18:18.867
Oh, Henry Allsmeyer.

18:19.353 --> 18:21.437
Make believe I didn't know Henry Alsmeyer.

18:21.457 --> 18:22.078
Describe him.

18:22.358 --> 18:24.742
Mr. Alsmeyer was one of the good old boys.

18:26.004 --> 18:29.771
He was tall, thin, like, and he knew everybody on campus.

18:30.191 --> 18:31.013
Everybody knew him.

18:31.093 --> 18:40.669
He knew the people that had been at A&M before, and he had, he'd see somebody that he knew, and a lot of the

18:41.780 --> 18:44.504
camaraderie with former ags.

18:45.245 --> 18:56.122
Mr. Osmar knew him, and they knew him, and so they would come in and they may give something to the library where they might not have given to, quote, a stranger.

18:56.362 --> 19:01.610
But he was one that was just, you could describe as a good old boy.

19:01.870 --> 19:06.437
Was, for you staff members, did you all see him as a good leader?

19:07.632 --> 19:10.356
I personally liked him.

19:10.436 --> 19:11.097
Some of them didn't.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.499
They thought he was too easy going.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.622
But that was his style.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.527
And I think we got a lot done under him.

19:18.547 --> 19:20.110
And he was always pleasant, wasn't he?

19:20.130 --> 19:20.490
Always.

19:20.590 --> 19:22.453
I never saw him cross.

19:22.473 --> 19:25.337
And like I said, he was one of the ones that

19:25.486 --> 19:27.748
Really came up from the ranks.

19:27.788 --> 19:33.013
He went to graduate school here at A&M and got his doctorate here at A&M.

19:33.033 --> 19:37.217
And he took leave from the library to finish his degree program.

19:37.237 --> 19:38.578
He was working here as a library.

19:39.499 --> 19:44.404
We had several people that worked at the library that went on and got advanced degrees here.

19:44.464 --> 19:46.746
Now he left to go to Central Arkansas?

19:47.086 --> 19:48.007
Somewhere in Arkansas.

19:48.027 --> 19:49.028
Now he's retired there.

19:49.048 --> 19:49.288
All right.

19:49.308 --> 19:52.511
Then he followed by Irene Hoedland?

19:52.531 --> 19:53.012
Irene Hoedland, yes.

19:53.032 --> 19:54.193
Describe her.

19:54.663 --> 19:56.665
She was micromanager.

20:00.108 --> 20:14.462
And a lot of them, she clashed with a lot of them, but she had her strength and she knew how she wanted the library to be and did not involve the staff so much in making decisions.

20:15.283 --> 20:20.788
All the decisions were made by her from the carpet.

20:22.422 --> 20:28.327
and in the building to a lot of materials that a lot of times, Ms.

20:28.348 --> 20:35.895
Charles Meyer would get a little bit more committees to work on and grow, but Dr. Hodley made the decisions.

20:36.295 --> 20:41.099
And if she didn't agree with it, I don't care how many committees she, and she appointed the committees.

20:41.940 --> 20:42.781
They weren't elected.

20:43.842 --> 20:46.424
And you could give her, they were as an advisory.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.307
And if she didn't like the advice,

20:50.772 --> 20:51.172
She did.

20:52.314 --> 20:53.636
Now, she came from Ohio State.

20:53.656 --> 20:54.056
She came.

20:54.477 --> 20:57.560
How easy was it for her to understand A&M when she got here?

20:57.641 --> 21:05.611
I'm sure it was hard because she wasn't used to the male dominance.

21:07.052 --> 21:10.216
And A&M was male-dominated.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.822
And many years, if...

21:15.342 --> 21:24.710
If you were military, and a lot of retired military came to work at A&M, and I think they got some of their positions because they were retired military.

21:25.791 --> 21:29.914
And so it was a military influence.

21:29.934 --> 21:39.162
And we had several, I don't know, one for example, he retired from, I forgot where Mr. Puget retired from, but he retired and he came to work at A&M and he worked here until he retired.

21:39.563 --> 21:44.607
And he was on the very strict regimented,

21:45.599 --> 21:52.826
supervisory program, and this did not work with Dr. Hoadley.

21:54.668 --> 22:06.120
And the military feeling, maybe it was, maybe because this was an all-male institution, whatever the man said ruled, and this did not work with Dr. Hoadley.

22:06.921 --> 22:14.188
She would have been the first major female

22:15.367 --> 22:16.048
Influence.

22:16.328 --> 22:20.392
Well, administrator on campus.

22:20.833 --> 22:28.140
Do you remember any situation she encountered that were a little unique because of her being a woman?

22:29.242 --> 22:42.015
I'm sure she had a lot of battles to win to get to be heard in meetings with administrators because she was a woman and they just didn't

22:43.835 --> 22:53.993
respect a woman in that type of leadership position, which now I think they're, and it's still on campus, it's hard for women to be in the administration, is that more?

22:54.494 --> 23:02.088
I was the chairman of the search committee at that time and Dr. Calhoun was very positive in his hoping we would select a female.

23:02.529 --> 23:07.277
He, I remember him particularly saying it's about time we get a woman in a key position.

23:07.257 --> 23:13.529
Did Dr. Hoadley have some key subordinates during her years in the library?

23:13.629 --> 23:18.579
Who did she turn to most as her second, third level in library?

23:18.599 --> 23:21.925
I think Evelyn King was the assistant director with her.

23:22.580 --> 23:31.173
And Evelyn graduated from LSU the year after I did, and she came in as Special Collections and built Special Collections.

23:32.014 --> 23:33.176
She was before Don Dial.

23:33.957 --> 23:45.735
And she had a lot of influence there, and she met a lot of the former ags and had a good working relationship with professors and former ags as her...

23:45.715 --> 23:48.238
tenure as head of Special Collections.

23:48.939 --> 23:58.890
And this complemented Dr. Henry Osmeier because they worked very closely together and he introduced her to a lot of people like that.

23:59.030 --> 24:07.740
And her working with this, I think, eased some of Dr. Hoadley's deal because she had already been

24:08.024 --> 24:31.112
accepted like I said back when I was back in the school like she was considered a part of the institution it was okay for her to be here she had been here she was not trying to show that she was more of anything she was what's what's the terminal and she was not not being dominated but she was not domineering

24:32.375 --> 24:50.817
and I think her personality smoothed over a lot of things that Dr. Hoagley's, but Dr. Hoagley was more, that was her personality, that was her background, and that's why she had to fight her way up in her circles is what she was doing.

24:50.917 --> 24:57.285
Now this last major addition to the Evans Library was done during Dr. Hoagley's years, I think, wasn't it?

24:59.830 --> 25:03.920
She did, she had a lot to do with it.

25:06.848 --> 25:10.958
Let's see, when did Dr. Heath come in?

25:10.978 --> 25:11.680
He came.

25:14.545 --> 25:16.889
But like the green carpet, she picked it.

25:16.909 --> 25:18.713
Yeah, Dr. Holt, like I said, the carpeting.

25:19.193 --> 25:23.561
And one thing about the carpeting and the full floor, Eddie Evans had been in.

25:23.642 --> 25:27.909
You had brown and tan and green and green and blue and blue.

25:28.270 --> 25:31.035
And it was color-coordinated by the floor.

25:31.488 --> 25:37.397
And the color might have been awful, but we were still using it.

25:37.457 --> 25:41.483
It was not showing the wear that some of the carpeting is.

25:41.643 --> 25:45.189
And so we were in that building and used it for 10 or 12 years.

25:45.209 --> 25:56.145
And when you think of all the thousands of people that walked on that for no more wear and tear in the building, that was one of the things that, but like I said, she picked it.

25:57.256 --> 26:02.286
And we may not agree with the color, but it sure lasted.

26:02.907 --> 26:14.370
And then she had input into the annex deal, and that was kind of her, and then Dr. Heath did into that.

26:14.790 --> 26:19.720
But I think that was her major deal, was to get this, and then she could retire with it.

26:19.700 --> 26:23.645
With dignity, she had her monument.

26:25.007 --> 26:27.850
And Dr. Heath came eight, nine years ago.

26:28.431 --> 26:28.791
Right.

26:30.574 --> 26:33.337
Do you remember the first reaction to him?

26:33.437 --> 26:35.239
What did people think when he was selected?

26:37.342 --> 26:42.328
Some of them, he was one of the ones that they interviewed about, I don't know, going to about three interviews.

26:43.189 --> 26:47.074
And he had a favorable interview with the staff.

26:48.235 --> 27:00.658
And I know someone, I don't remember who, but it was someone from the administration that was coming over to that, and you said, well, how do you feel about fundraising?

27:02.528 --> 27:11.038
And Dr. Heath came in, to my impression, not so much the normal day-to-day running of the library.

27:11.058 --> 27:14.702
He's more of the ones that go out and get funds.

27:15.143 --> 27:16.985
And that's what his position has been.

27:17.686 --> 27:24.694
And that's what he's basically done and led the day-to-day with the assistant directors.

27:25.755 --> 27:27.837
And that's good and that's bad.

27:28.298 --> 27:31.742
I mean, he needs a little bit more hand on what's going on in the building.

27:32.549 --> 27:39.128
But I remember at the interview somebody asked him what he thought about fundraising.

27:39.248 --> 27:41.214
He said, I have been doing that at Tech.

27:42.779 --> 27:44.263
That is what I'm used to.

27:45.610 --> 27:47.914
And they said, how do you feel about talking to?

27:48.214 --> 27:53.863
He said, I regularly have coffee with Sid Richardson, Bass.

27:54.263 --> 27:58.430
And he started naming the top money people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

27:58.530 --> 28:03.277
He said, those are my friends I have coffee with all the time.

28:03.978 --> 28:05.340
I socialize with them.

28:05.921 --> 28:07.163
I play golf with them.

28:07.835 --> 28:09.437
Now, was this in the interview?

28:09.517 --> 28:10.578
This was in the interview.

28:10.638 --> 28:11.218
Before he came here.

28:11.258 --> 28:12.520
This was before he came here.

28:12.960 --> 28:18.465
So he was letting us know that he would not be intimidated by meeting someone that had money.

28:19.466 --> 28:25.592
And he would not hesitate because he said, I have friends in those places and I have no hesitation for asking them.

28:26.954 --> 28:33.420
And I will go and my major goal is to bring funds to this library to build it.

28:33.552 --> 28:40.288
In terms of the day-to-day style he represents, did he change things?

28:40.308 --> 28:45.119
Were things more formal, less formal, more relaxed, less relaxed when he got here?

28:46.723 --> 28:49.890
We see less of him than we did of any other director.

28:52.739 --> 28:58.445
And I know the other directors had more of a, you'd see them more.

28:59.266 --> 29:01.548
So he's more of a delegator of authority.

29:01.648 --> 29:01.949
Right.

29:03.430 --> 29:10.598
As far as y'all are aware, in recent years, has the budget been... The budget has grown, and he's working on that.

29:10.718 --> 29:19.067
And we've got, in the last few years, I don't know, 10 years, we've had somebody in the foundation that's been...

29:19.874 --> 29:27.463
charged with getting money for the former students and all for the library to build money.

29:27.543 --> 29:45.885
And then Dr. Heath goes out on fundraising deal and he's encouraged Don Dahl and Special Collections and David Chapman to go out and build those special collections so that we'll have, we're not just a general library.

29:46.846 --> 29:47.907
And for years,

29:48.983 --> 29:57.514
The A&M Library was representing the public library as well as the library, because we served as the library for the whole community.

29:57.554 --> 30:05.905
And now a lot of the stuff is going research and bringing in money for that, especially in special collections.

30:06.106 --> 30:13.435
Those are the noted special collections like the science fiction collection, the range livestock collection, or something like this.

30:13.475 --> 30:18.602
What are the other, what are the major special collections that A&M has?

30:19.325 --> 30:27.293
I think the Range Livestock Collection, the Western Americana, Western Illustrators, the Science Fiction Collection,

30:27.357 --> 30:35.390
We, that was a frivolous type collection, because science fiction is pulp magazine that you don't, mostly comes out in paperback.

30:36.311 --> 30:49.652
And we personally, I think we need to order more than one copy, one for the special research collections, and we're a noted collection in that area, as well as a circulating copy for the students.

30:50.233 --> 30:54.900
We have a good bit of Texana, we'll never be the

30:54.880 --> 30:57.544
outstanding collection in Texas Santa.

30:58.245 --> 31:05.457
We have a good collection in say the Ku Klux Klan era materials.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.904
Did we get the Jeff Dykes collection after you got here?

31:10.224 --> 31:10.946
Yes, we did.

31:10.986 --> 31:15.473
Tell this machine anything you remember about how that came about.

31:15.513 --> 31:17.496
All I know is he was

31:17.898 --> 31:26.743
here with the Western Americana, and I don't know how he talked us into getting it, but we have it, and he was also one of the ones that started in the Westerners
