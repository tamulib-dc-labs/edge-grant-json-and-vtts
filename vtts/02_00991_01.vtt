00:11.388 --> 00:21.905
This is an interview with Dennis Ingram by John 
Backus on November 26, 1988, at his home in Irving,

00:11.388 --> 00:21.905
Texas, concerning the Vietnam War. In the 
interest of accumulating knowledge about the

00:23.127 --> 00:29.377
war, I'm going to donate this tape to the Texas A&M 
Oral History Collection in the University

00:23.127 --> 00:29.377
Archives. Is this all right with you? Yes. Could 
you please give me your date and place of birth?

00:38.185 --> 00:43.513
Wichita, Kansas, August 7, 1938. What was your 
education before? I was a new graduate before

00:45.656 --> 00:49.822
military. How and why did you join the service?

00:53.788 --> 01:04.403
Well, I had made a couple of research things

00:53.788 --> 01:04.403
on the 70th grade. I made a couple of research 
things about underwater demolition. I decided

01:08.392 --> 01:13.819
that's what I wanted to do, so I did

01:08.392 --> 01:13.819
it. Can you give us a brief sketch of your military 
career before Vietnam?

01:20.687 --> 01:32.843
Well, when I first joined in 1957, I

01:20.687 --> 01:32.843
was attached to a beachmaster unit in Coronado 
Beach, California. That also happened to be the

01:32.863 --> 01:37.048
same base that Underwater Demolition did their 
training in. It was across the bay from San Diego.

01:43.314 --> 01:57.473
My first year, I didn't do anything but play 
football and basketball

01:43.314 --> 01:57.473
and wrestle and baseball for the base unit. At the 
end of the first year, I put in for unity training.

02:01.078 --> 02:05.364
And then went through 20 weeks of training.

02:05.384 --> 02:06.546
Got it done to what it was. I finished it out the last 
three years in Unit

02:08.990 --> 02:15.722
10. When did you go to Vietnam? Well, actually we 
went to Vietnam off of what they call Westpac

02:20.510 --> 02:27.943
Detachment.

02:29.915 --> 02:42.913
In May of 1960, we went to what they call Westpac 
Detachment, which was the Orient in Coronado

02:29.915 --> 02:42.913
Beach, California. We actually went into 
Vietnam, it would have been about November and

02:42.933 --> 02:54.829
December of 1960.

02:54.849 --> 02:57.593
We were the first 16 people in Vietnam. Which unit 
were you with? That would have been the beginnings

03:06.476 --> 03:14.543
of the SEAL units, the first 16 SEALs.

03:14.563 --> 03:17.826
What's the difference between the UDTs and the 
SEALs? They had UDTs back in World War II.

03:22.671 --> 03:27.955
Well, it has grown to be what the difference is. The 
SEALs will do more.

03:33.280 --> 03:37.745
They will go through more extensive training on 
top of the 20 weeks. They will go through jump

03:37.765 --> 03:52.301
schools, free fall schools, language schools, 
and survival schools that are even more extensive

03:37.765 --> 03:52.301
than you had in UDT. They will also

03:52.321 --> 04:01.752
do a wider variety of operations.

04:03.335 --> 04:08.880
We usually operate mostly in and around water. 
Seals will go inland, they'll go by air, they'll go

04:08.900 --> 04:17.948
by land, they'll go by whatever is necessary.

04:18.469 --> 04:22.873
Well, in Vietnam, what was the actual mission that 
y'all had? Well, come to find out, once we got

04:23.853 --> 04:33.342
there, the whole point was the 16 of us was to teach 
and train these people in warfare. We met a select

04:35.482 --> 04:41.151
group of people in this village. And they were from 
all over South Vietnam. And they were there with

04:46.098 --> 04:54.471
the purpose to be trained in the different facets 
of warfare. Radios, to explosives, to

04:54.612 --> 04:59.579
hand-to-hand, to weaponry, whatever. So y'all 
were actually training South Vietnamese SEALs?

05:02.784 --> 05:03.345
No. They were everything from Montiards to just 
village people. But they were representatives of

05:08.132 --> 05:16.787
all the different factions in South Vietnam at the 
time. But after we got through training with them,

05:16.807 --> 05:25.502
they would go back to their own detachments

05:16.807 --> 05:25.502
and give them this training.

05:28.958 --> 05:31.402
Did you have a particular specialty that you were 
teaching? Yes, hand-to-hand

05:33.225 --> 05:39.955
combat. So y'all were there strictly for 
training? You didn't actually carry out any

05:41.818 --> 05:46.124
combat missions of your own? Oh, when we got there, 
we took them out. Eventually, we took them out to

05:50.451 --> 05:54.177
teach us. We were ambushed. how to set up an 
operation, how to control it, how to return from

05:56.397 --> 06:15.082
it, things that you need to know to do these things, 
and got involved in

05:56.397 --> 06:15.082
a couple of bandages. So y'all were over there 
before any of the conventional U.S. military

06:15.102 --> 06:24.514
units were over there, just the only ones over 
there at the time were just military advisors?

06:25.574 --> 06:33.065
Matter of fact,

06:25.574 --> 06:33.065
it was not supposed to be known. Matter of fact, it 
wasn't known somewhere between three and five

06:33.086 --> 06:41.819
years that anybody had been in there in 1960.

06:41.939 --> 06:49.431
In 1960, they were still trying to get over the 
French fighting in there, been in there for ten

06:41.939 --> 06:49.431
years. So there was still some of that the residue 
of the French conflict over there,

06:53.502 --> 07:01.151
when we were there. How did the Vietnamese look at 
y'all as imperialists? I mean, were y'all looked

07:05.957 --> 07:11.845
at in the same frame of light as the French were?

07:11.865 --> 07:16.150
No.

07:16.170 --> 07:22.598
Of course, you know, when you're at the end of a 
10-year cycle of fighting and conflict, you look

07:23.270 --> 07:27.354
at those people considerably different than you 
do at the new people coming in. Because the new

07:28.254 --> 07:39.504
people coming in, you have a tendency to believe 
and hope that they are going to do something to stop

07:28.254 --> 07:39.504
the problem. We saw the same thing in Second World 
War. They were all happy and delighted that

07:42.907 --> 07:49.153
anybody was coming in to stop the Nazis. They 
didn't care if it was Russia or America or who it

07:50.194 --> 07:52.956
was. But they were excited. And then after that 
group had been in there for a while, especially the

07:56.668 --> 08:09.730
Russians, you saw this same angst in these people. 
They would just as soon have them out of there as

08:09.830 --> 08:12.975
well. I think the same thing is true when we went in. 
You saw this attitude about the French. And, of

08:22.096 --> 08:25.320
course, the communists, they were sick and tired 
of that. So we held hope for them. But you saw this

08:29.826 --> 08:38.837
insane attitude by the end of the American

08:29.826 --> 08:38.837
combat there. They were fed up and sick of it, and 
they were taking anybody's promise.

08:46.507 --> 08:47.428
And it cost them. What did you think of the 
abilities of the Vietnamese in this fight? When we

08:54.151 --> 09:04.282
got there, it took us better than two weeks of 
feeding these people, putting them through

08:54.151 --> 09:04.282
conditioning. And I mean this was all of them that 
were at that particular place for us. We had to feed

09:11.831 --> 09:16.376
them and train them again and build them up for two 
weeks. We had to feed them for two weeks. So they

09:18.863 --> 09:24.349
would have the strength to do any of the things that 
we were trying to show them. They couldn't carry

09:24.369 --> 09:25.650
the materials. They couldn't do the combat. They 
couldn't do the hand-to-hand. They couldn't do

09:29.614 --> 09:31.857
any of these things when we first got there. They 
were so beat down and so undernourished, I guess.

09:39.685 --> 09:41.587
They were just not physically able. Now, they 
could walk from here to the other side of the world.

09:45.070 --> 09:53.598
They couldn't do anything as they were in that you 
would be expected

09:45.070 --> 09:53.598
to do, to fight. Where in South Vietnam were you all 
located at? We went up a river. We didn't know where

09:58.903 --> 10:01.045
we were either. We never even heard of Vietnam at 
the time. They put us, all 16 of us, on a ship and took

10:04.769 --> 10:13.737
us from Taiwan. We steamed. on a ship for a little 
better than three days. Then they put us on a mic

10:19.921 --> 10:23.426
boat off the ship. And we traveled for the better 
part

10:24.808 --> 10:34.302
of a day and a half up a river. It was around a 
mountain

10:34.322 --> 10:38.188
down in the valley. And we come to find out it was a 
river below Da Nang that goes inland for maybe 100

10:45.972 --> 10:52.738
miles. By the time we had circulated and done all we 
needed to do, I suppose we'd probably have been

10:53.319 --> 11:01.466
there 50, 60 miles.

11:01.486 --> 11:02.227
It's a little river. Well, it's not a little river. 
It's just below demand. It was supposed to be top

11:08.373 --> 11:11.415
secret, but they knew we were coming. We didn't 
know we were going. We didn't even know where we

11:12.857 --> 11:15.439
were going when they told us to get our gear. They 
changed ships.

11:20.054 --> 11:25.601
Before we stepped onto the shore of this village, 
they told us where we were. And to a man, not one of us

11:26.361 --> 11:28.244
knew where we were. They didn't know what a Vietnam 
was, never even heard of it. So you received no

11:33.229 --> 11:36.993
special training for Vietnam specifically? 
Well, we were chosen for our assignment based on

11:37.013 --> 11:44.462
our abilities.

11:44.482 --> 11:45.443
And it didn't take time to see what we needed. what 
became a civil

11:46.840 --> 11:51.025
unit. Like the guys who were specifically there to 
run radios and communications, that's what their

11:51.045 --> 12:05.242
training had been in the unit.

12:05.262 --> 12:16.695
Guys in different facets were chosen out of the 
whole West Pack attachment, out of our team, to

12:05.262 --> 12:16.695
teach these things.

12:21.367 --> 12:31.819
Do you think it would have been better if they had 
maybe an isolated job to prepare y'all for

12:21.367 --> 12:31.819
Vietnam, to give y'all some area orientation, or 
to help y'all prepare for your classes? Because we

12:31.839 --> 12:35.223
did what we were sent in to do, and that was to teach 
these people. And by the time we left, it was only

12:36.605 --> 12:43.853
nearly two months later, they were ready. So the 
shortcomings of Vietnam weren't because the

12:45.395 --> 12:49.500
people didn't know how to fight. A lot of it was 
because we have

12:50.932 --> 13:05.169
conventional-thinking military men at the top 
who think that you're going to fight every war like

12:50.932 --> 13:05.169
you fought the First and Second World Wars, and 
that's the way you're going to fight this stuff.

13:06.050 --> 13:08.113
They can't fight it that way. And it took them 
forever, it seemed to me, to realize that. Plus the

13:12.038 --> 13:18.846
fact that the guys that were sent over there long 
after I was there couldn't quite grasp

13:22.673 --> 13:23.855
what they were up against. Because some of the 
people that you're working with side by side, day

13:25.698 --> 13:39.258
after day, you don't realize, and you're not 
conditioned to realize, that some of those people

13:25.698 --> 13:39.258
are your enemy. And you won't know it until 
somebody drops a hand grenade in your bed at night.

13:46.509 --> 13:48.452
But that wears them. And there are a lot of things 
that went sour over there. not the least of which is

13:51.361 --> 13:57.708
our political problem over here.

13:57.728 --> 14:08.299
While this is the greatest country in the world, 
some of our freedoms are what costs us in these kind

13:57.728 --> 14:08.299
of conflicts. And that's what makes them so 
dangerous is that we have so many freedoms here

14:08.319 --> 14:20.372
that we have a tendency or the people here that are 
not doing the fighting have a tendency to get our

14:08.319 --> 14:20.372
people who are fighting in big time trouble. So you 
feel that the anti-war movement created a larger

14:22.800 --> 14:31.047
problem later on? Well, I believe maybe contrary 
to a lot of thought. Of course, I think a lot of

14:37.292 --> 14:42.256
people think about anti-war when they think of 
people like Jane Fonda. Jane Fonda is a blister on a

14:42.276 --> 14:45.999
giant's fanny as far as I'm concerned. She was just 
a minor nuisance. However, she cost a lot of people

14:48.021 --> 14:50.443
lives. And I think we've got politicians who ought 
to know better that cost a whole lot more lives than

14:51.014 --> 14:58.505
Jane Fonnell ever now. So you think the problem 
with the war wasn't with the military? I mean, the

15:00.187 --> 15:05.875
problem with the actual outcome of the war wasn't 
with the actual, not the anti-war movement, but

15:00.187 --> 15:05.875
the civilian leadership? That's exactly. There 
was no way you could cut it any other way. We went in

15:09.661 --> 15:14.688
there

15:09.661 --> 15:14.688
on a flyer.

15:17.993 --> 15:19.755
It was fairly obvious. within a matter of a couple 
of three years. We could have won if we had been in

15:26.108 --> 15:29.912
there for the right reason. We weren't in there for 
the right reasons. We were a holding action. The

15:35.157 --> 15:38.940
problem with holding is that what you're holding 
starts getting sticky. We keep pumping in bodies

15:40.101 --> 15:44.745
and bringing them out in bags. And that does 
something to your fighting spirit, especially

15:46.427 --> 15:50.130
from the a guy that gets drafted right off of 
college campus and said, all right, here's a gun,

15:50.347 --> 15:54.452
go fight. And he doesn't have the slightest idea of 
what he's doing over there. And out of stark

15:58.136 --> 16:06.445
terror, we start getting involved in drugs and one 
thing or another, graft and everything else. And

16:06.465 --> 16:11.631
then the fighting spirit goes down the tubes.

16:11.651 --> 16:12.432
And it was obvious. Have you read anything about it 
at all or have you lived any part of it? But the

16:17.870 --> 16:22.374
government was not going to allow you to go in there 
to fight a war and win it. And we're not going to do

16:22.394 --> 16:23.736
it. Now, for whatever reasons, and I don't profess 
to know all the reasons, but I know enough to know

16:23.756 --> 16:38.290
the reason we weren't going there, the reason we 
couldn't get it done, because they didn't want to.

16:38.310 --> 16:41.393
You'd have to ask them, why were we there in the 
first place? And if they tell you that it was to stop

16:41.413 --> 16:45.177
communism, then why did we stop it?

16:49.038 --> 16:49.980
Why didn't we stop? Why haven't we stopped it 
anywhere?

16:56.131 --> 17:02.161
Unfortunately, the problem is the guys who 
dictate that we go to war are not the guys we have to

16:56.131 --> 17:02.161
fight for. And I can tell you how to stop it here. As 
you make Congress and the Senate and all the

17:05.908 --> 17:11.117
government people, you make them go first. Or at 
least lead us in. And then they'll start finding

17:15.177 --> 17:17.660
ways to stop this stuff. I mean, do it on both sides 
of the conflict. You let the leaders get out there

17:20.924 --> 17:27.011
and start showing us how to swing it.

17:27.031 --> 17:35.180
The problem is we've got so much freedom here that 
we can't grasp the countries who don't have it. And

17:35.200 --> 17:37.783
we assume that they've got to play the same way we 
do. And they don't.

17:41.427 --> 17:44.931
And we're already at a disadvantage in that kind of 
a war because of that.

17:50.142 --> 17:57.712
We went in there with the idea, I assume, that we 
were going to intimidate these people to being

17:50.142 --> 17:57.712
good boys. Well, they'd already demonstrated 
they were going to be good boys. For 10 years, they

18:00.055 --> 18:01.577
fought the French. Of course, the French wanted to 
own the country.

18:09.267 --> 18:13.973
You're not going to intimidate

18:09.267 --> 18:13.973
them that way. You're just not going to stop. And we 
showed them. We demonstrated that pretty well.

18:18.459 --> 18:18.799
We've got politicians that say they've got to go 
over there and take a look and they're so full of

18:19.133 --> 18:44.837
themselves that if you took them to a place that 
they could see the truth they wouldn't recognize

18:19.133 --> 18:44.837
it and they're going to come back and say and do 
exactly what they wanted to do when they went over

18:19.133 --> 18:44.837
there to take a look in the first place and that crud 
still exists in our military problems today

18:51.432 --> 19:03.048
You're the one that's

18:51.432 --> 19:03.048
over there on the dirty end of the grunt stick.

19:06.473 --> 19:13.482
You don't need some snot nose telling you what 
you're fighting about. On your opinion, what do

19:13.502 --> 19:19.330
you think should have been done differently to 
come up with them to get a better outcome? for

19:20.795 --> 19:24.163
somebody to determine what we're there about. And 
then let the fighting man go do what he's there to

19:24.183 --> 19:27.531
do. If you're there to establish something, get it 
established. We could have done that. We had the

19:31.922 --> 19:32.925
horsepower. We had the memory. We had it all.

19:37.656 --> 19:38.398
But we were... stopped from going into Cambodia. 
You're stopped from going across this parallel.

19:43.538 --> 19:46.041
You're stopped from going across this river. Now, 
they'd come over and kick the snot out of you, but

19:46.322 --> 19:51.590
you couldn't chase them back across, and they had 
sanction. And they knew it. Now, that means you're

19:54.775 --> 19:58.020
fighting at a terrible disadvantage. Now, we did a 
lot of things

19:58.040 --> 20:03.889
that nobody's supposed to know we did. Now, it's 
getting pretty shameful. that we put a name on such

20:08.416 --> 20:16.867
a thing as war, and we're going to fight it by rules, 
thinking that we're the gentlemen. You don't

20:16.887 --> 20:19.350
fight a war by being gentlemen. That isn't what war 
is about. If we can't establish what we're going in

20:22.234 --> 20:25.498
for, then we ought to stay out. And if we're going 
in, what do we want to accomplish? And once we've

20:30.404 --> 20:32.887
determined those things, then let's go do it. 
Because we can do it.

20:41.002 --> 20:48.909
of the freedoms we have, everybody can say what he 
wants to say, much as I'm saying

20:41.002 --> 20:48.909
now. But the problem seems to be what a politician 
says. He carries clout.

21:02.882 --> 21:06.886
It's a costly

21:02.882 --> 21:06.886
thing. I don't know that we ever knew, that the 
government ever really knew what they wanted to

21:11.090 --> 21:13.533
accomplish. If they went in there on a lark,

21:13.553 --> 21:23.825
and then they got it on their hand and couldn't get 
it off, couldn't lay it down. And everybody's

21:24.726 --> 21:27.008
looking for a way to get out with honor. One way to 
get off with honor is to kick somebody's fanny and

21:27.989 --> 21:31.894
walk away. Or say, you know, I'm someplace I 
shouldn't be and walk away. Apology will get it

21:38.622 --> 21:40.624
just as fast as you You happen to kill somebody. No, 
we're going to show our honor up to the point that

21:44.504 --> 21:54.013
they demonstrate to us it's going to be costly. And 
then we swallow our honor and our dead, and we still

21:54.033 --> 21:58.777
walk away. That's political. It ain't got 
anything to do with military. That's political.

22:06.365 --> 22:10.729
Until we stop fighting wars based on what some 
yo-yo in Washington, D.C. or a or Russia or whoever

22:11.080 --> 22:15.325
decides we're going to fight it over.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.819
Somebody's got to make a decision. Once you tell 
the average military man what he's there to do, he

22:26.839 --> 22:32.847
can carry out an assignment. But I don't know 
anybody in business or military that can carry out

22:32.867 --> 22:39.535
an assignment if you just tell him, Go over there 
and fight. Go over there and hang out. Go over there

22:45.061 --> 22:47.744
and do whatever. Somebody's got to be in charge. 
And everybody, postures,

22:49.145 --> 22:56.832
saber rattles.

23:01.296 --> 23:02.718
They weren't the ones in the trenches. They 
weren't the ones in the jungles. They weren't the

23:04.299 --> 23:07.362
ones over there with footlots.

23:13.501 --> 23:15.062
Did you feel we should have been there to begin 
with? And if so, did you feel it could have been won?

23:20.807 --> 23:26.613
Could we have won that on

23:20.807 --> 23:26.613
the battlefield? Well,

23:26.633 --> 23:38.323
at the time I was

23:26.633 --> 23:38.323
there, I was sent in there to train somebody. 
That's all I knew about it. I wouldn't have done my

23:43.555 --> 23:49.423
job any differently had I known more about the 
country than I did. Of course, at that time, nobody

23:49.443 --> 23:56.211
had any concept that this thing would grow into 
such a cesspool.

24:01.498 --> 24:04.562
But could we have won it? We could have certainly 
changed it. We could have secured it much as we did

24:07.406 --> 24:12.432
the Korean situation.

24:15.500 --> 24:26.735
even though America didn't exactly do a bang-up 
job there, we at least divided the thing between

24:15.500 --> 24:26.735
democracy and communism.

24:26.755 --> 24:33.103
And as it is, we allowed an awful lot of instigators 
to die. How should they fight it different? Should

24:35.306 --> 24:38.850
they fight it as a counterinsurgency or bring in 
the tanks? The biggest way to fight it differently

24:38.870 --> 24:45.439
is you tell everybody in the entire area that there 
are no boundaries we want to cross. You come over

24:49.556 --> 24:53.962
here and toss something, and we're coming in after 
you. It's like sending a hunting dog up a tree. You

24:57.447 --> 24:58.388
don't just tree him. You go in after him. So I turn to 
the dogs and say, you bring it out to me. You cross

25:07.080 --> 25:14.110
our river or our boundaries or our whatever, then 
you expect us to come back because we're coming in.

25:15.963 --> 25:20.548
And we were so hamstrung over that very fact. And 
they knew it. And they played our politics to the

25:22.390 --> 25:27.336
hilt. And we never were allowed. Based on what? 
They'll give you all these bull jive stories about

25:34.063 --> 25:39.890
why we couldn't do these things. Why we'd bring 
Cambodia in or we'd bring China in. They were

25:42.413 --> 25:43.394
already in it. Who do you think we were fighting 
over there? These weren't Montyards we were out

25:47.823 --> 26:02.161
there swinging

25:47.823 --> 26:02.161
at. So you supported it when Nixon invaded 
Cambodia? Yes. You think they should have done

26:09.170 --> 26:10.612
that sooner? Yes. Same with the mining of Haiphong 
Harbor? B-52 strikes on Saigon. That's right. Or

26:21.276 --> 26:23.078
rather, Hanoi. Hanoi, Saigon, Saigon,

26:23.158 --> 26:28.844
Saigon. Yeah. Coaching in

26:30.205 --> 26:40.135
the city that

26:30.205 --> 26:40.135
we gave away. Anything you can do to establish in 
the enemy's

26:40.155 --> 26:48.103
mind that you're not quarantined as to what you're 
going to do. They have to deal with the fact that

26:49.045 --> 26:53.671
they, first, don't know what you might do. And 
number two, know that you're not restricted from

26:53.691 --> 26:58.777
doing anything. Now, that changes the complexion 
of your enemy.

27:03.903 --> 27:07.207
That's the reason Uniteen SEAL is effective. Tell 
anybody we're going to have to fight a certain way.

27:10.451 --> 27:12.633
Say we show up a certain place at a certain time. 
You're just there all of a sudden. And that's the

27:18.644 --> 27:30.078
reason that the most effective fighting groups in 
Vietnam were the Rangers of the Marine Corps,

27:18.644 --> 27:30.078
SEALs, UDT, the special units. Matter of fact, I 
was talking to a guy this past week about, he was a

27:32.120 --> 27:39.489
young fellow you just met, his dad. They assigned 
him with...

27:47.804 --> 27:52.291
paratroopers, and they jumped into this 
particular place. You can fight that war over

27:52.311 --> 27:54.494
there with a bunch of paratroopers. That isn't 
that kind of war. You were involved in that, so you

27:57.399 --> 28:00.183
know that, or you ought to know that. Where are you 
going to jump?

28:05.070 --> 28:14.084
But they jumped in, and it took them two weeks to 
determine the fact that they jumped into

28:05.070 --> 28:14.084
something they shouldn't have been into. That 
isn't the way to fight that. The 193rd he was with?

28:19.407 --> 28:20.228
The 193rd? Was that a brigade that jumped in at 
Operation Junction City? I don't know. This must

28:25.495 --> 28:28.118
have been in 1967, I think. Would that have been... 
See, I don't know about their operations after I

28:29.219 --> 28:32.604
was gone. I mean, they were involved in a lot of 
things.

28:38.030 --> 28:42.736
Conventional warfare is ridiculous to do like 
that. Well, Special Forces was... doing similar

28:44.757 --> 28:46.118
to what you were doing. They were training the 
Montagnards

28:46.138 --> 28:52.524
and watching the border men. Thought they should 
have done more of that? Yes. Because I tell you,

28:55.346 --> 29:04.635
almost every place that had that kind of a 
situation, they were the most secure places in

28:55.346 --> 29:04.635
that country.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.722
You can't necessarily do that to Saigon. because 
it's a humongous city,

29:13.664 --> 29:30.386
but most businesses are saying

29:13.664 --> 29:30.386
that you can only go so far.

29:30.406 --> 29:33.110
You only fight a certain one. Who establishes

29:33.130 --> 29:38.577
that? It shouldn't be somebody over here doing it. 
So it should have been mainly left up to the special

29:42.470 --> 29:47.437
warfare units?

29:48.679 --> 29:53.987
There's always room and there's always a 
necessity for numbers. And you can't possibly

29:54.007 --> 30:01.598
have enough numbers

29:54.007 --> 30:01.598
in special units. Not that many of us.

30:07.005 --> 30:11.532
But you're going to accomplish a whole lot more 
doing it quietly than you are coming in there. I

30:14.931 --> 30:22.340
think the first detachment that we really became 
aware of was 50,000 men went in there. Well,

30:22.360 --> 30:28.727
50,000, I remember, you know, even 1962, I think it 
was, or late 61. I mean, this was a year and a half,

30:29.008 --> 30:32.372
two years later. And I was thinking, 50,000, 
everyone there, 50,000 people weighed through

30:33.593 --> 30:40.742
that entire country. Hold on. The first combat 
troops were the Marines landed in 1965. So up until

30:45.728 --> 30:48.452
then, it was just still nothing but military 
advisors. Yeah, it was just, of course, we're

30:48.472 --> 30:53.739
doing that same type of thing around the world.

30:57.624 --> 30:58.205
They need it. I don't deny that a bit. I mean, these 
people obviously need it if they want to sit there

31:00.408 --> 31:03.612
and fight. But the point was is they were training 
them to fight their war and us stay out. But

31:12.278 --> 31:15.202
invariably, we get drawn into this stuff. And 
invariably, our military, time after time, is

31:15.222 --> 31:24.615
hamstrung before we ever get in there. And it's 
done not because of the military. It's done

31:27.279 --> 31:30.183
because of the politicians. My feeling here, and 
has been and probably will remain, the next fight

31:30.203 --> 31:39.476
we get into, we ought to send every politician from 
the state level up. You think we ought to be? You go.

31:43.953 --> 31:45.095
Don't send your son. You go.

31:49.704 --> 31:54.654
The same thing is required of any other nation that 
we get into. You send your old cannon mouths out

31:54.674 --> 32:00.145
here, and you guys duke it out. If you can't settle 
it, then us young folks, you know, those that are

32:00.626 --> 32:05.455
left like you, you go fight.

32:12.623 --> 32:17.150
to rattle all the

32:12.623 --> 32:17.150
politicians. Are you familiar with, speaking of 
how the SEALs were involved, are you familiar at

32:17.170 --> 32:23.740
all with the Phoenix Project? No. The work that the 
SEALs were doing with them? No. Phoenix? That was

32:31.792 --> 32:34.156
later on. Just if you didn't hear it. Last time

32:37.721 --> 32:41.787
they came dragging me away was about 1964 or 5. You 
were already out by then? Yeah, I got out in

32:44.011 --> 32:48.802
61. See, 61, I got out in August. It was October of 
61. The Cuban Missile Crisis

32:54.414 --> 32:59.966
cracked. I followed it back here.

33:08.446 --> 33:14.576
What did you think about the fighting ability of 
the North Vietnam user that you read at comm? Or did

33:14.596 --> 33:17.380
you not see enough of that? Well, I know

33:17.400 --> 33:25.292
enough about them. I guess the biggest difference 
is, and again, it goes back to our freedoms, the

33:25.312 --> 33:35.989
difference in their fighting people and our 
fighting people We know what it is to do what we

33:37.522 --> 33:39.925
please. They only know to do what they're told to 
do. They're raised that way. So they will take

33:48.174 --> 33:57.325
hardship much longer than we will without 
revolting.

33:57.345 --> 34:06.415
Military, what makes the United States so good in 
military deals is their individuality. That is

34:07.407 --> 34:26.494
the hardest thing for an Asian mind to grasp, is how 
we can be almost, or at least appear to be, so

34:07.407 --> 34:26.494
undisciplined that they don't know what to do with 
it. So we had all these people over there with that

34:26.514 --> 34:31.941
mindset that could have made a grand difference.

34:35.246 --> 34:36.047
Why we didn't, You'd have to talk to people who were 
doing the directing.

34:42.546 --> 34:59.809
Those people in that part of the country

34:42.546 --> 34:59.809
have lived almost on some semblance of a contract.

34:59.829 --> 35:06.017
And they also

34:59.829 --> 35:06.017
have this religion. They

35:07.398 --> 35:16.869
believe that

35:07.398 --> 35:16.869
it's to their advantage to die for their country. 
That they will be reincarnated and live a better

35:16.889 --> 35:18.671
life. All these things after death. So if you were 
raised all your life

35:23.918 --> 35:35.812
having little, little wouldn't be that big a deal 
for me to go there. That's what makes them tough.

35:37.233 --> 35:40.057
for an American to fight. And these people lived in 
caves and out in the open and just things that the

35:40.077 --> 35:50.491
average American would shudder to consider. And 
the Japs did the same thing in Okinawa and all the

35:50.511 --> 35:55.538
islands. They got into the caves and they dug 
trenches and they dug holes in the ground and lived

35:55.558 --> 36:03.409
in it.

36:08.384 --> 36:23.748
They're

36:08.384 --> 36:23.748
tough people. Probably

36:23.768 --> 36:28.896
the toughest in the whole bunch is coal rangers. 
Rocks. They terrified everybody. Every village

36:29.577 --> 36:30.819
they ever walked into, they terrified everybody. 
Tough folks, good folks.

36:40.868 --> 36:42.930
What was your opinion of the military leadership? 
Not

36:43.631 --> 36:53.482
the civilians, but the military. I think they were 
more concerned about their own political

36:53.502 --> 36:57.046
ambitions than they were in leading our people. If 
they'd won, they'd have told some of these

36:57.066 --> 37:03.233
political leaders to kiss

36:57.066 --> 37:03.233
off. If some of those military people had done what 
their conscience told them to do, they'd have told

37:03.253 --> 37:09.880
the military leader political leadership, you 
either put us in and turn us loose or you get us out.

37:18.219 --> 37:29.532
So you think it was up to this Joint Chiefs of Staff 
to either convince the President not to go into

37:18.219 --> 37:29.532
Vietnam or to be prepared to resign and protest?

37:33.937 --> 37:38.002
In good conscience,

37:33.937 --> 37:38.002
yes. Military leadership is responsible. to the 
President of the United States. But a good leader

37:44.390 --> 37:51.199
is also responsible to and for his men.

37:51.219 --> 37:52.941
It's rather disheartening. You just have to 
believe that it had been terribly disheartening

37:53.141 --> 38:08.400
to think that you had a general that was telling you 
to get up and fight a windmill,

37:53.141 --> 38:08.400
as these guys were asked to do, with no weapon at 
all. Tie their hands behind them.

38:13.343 --> 38:17.027
They had to know if they had any intelligence at 
all. And they said that we were loaded with

38:17.408 --> 38:19.430
intelligence.

38:22.353 --> 38:28.761
They had to know long before we ever got out of there 
that we needed to be out of there. Or we needed to be

38:28.781 --> 38:34.908
in there doing something entirely different than 
we were doing.

38:34.928 --> 38:40.414
And it turns out that so many of those military 
leaders

38:43.280 --> 38:50.549
became political

38:43.280 --> 38:50.549
leaders. Too many officers were just out there 
trying to get their

38:50.569 --> 38:59.521
ticket punched. I guess that's the way it would 
prove out. It seems like the officers that were

39:01.263 --> 39:11.075
there for other reasons led their men and led them 
well. There isn't any substitute for having an

39:11.095 --> 39:13.118
officer that wants to get a job done and will do it at 
all costs, but not expose his entire command just

39:15.038 --> 39:27.664
for his benefit. That's a man that's concerned 
about two things, getting a job done or not.

39:42.848 --> 39:47.013
So I don't just sit around and talk about it. Make up 
numbers. Force their people under to literally

39:49.255 --> 39:55.382
lie to support their position. I've seen a couple 
of trials over that.

40:00.148 --> 40:04.232
Always crap running downhill. It's always the guy 
down line that's really going to get it splashed on

40:04.252 --> 40:08.417
them.

40:24.378 --> 40:37.320
Chief joins his staff, I think, just in their own, 
just in the terminology, tells

40:24.378 --> 40:37.320
you these people are political. If we're going to 
continue to fight political wars, the

40:37.340 --> 40:39.484
politicians ought to be the ones

40:59.410 --> 41:07.559
Going back to your actual operations that you were 
involved in, did you feel that the actual training

40:59.410 --> 41:07.559
that you were conducting was successful?

41:07.579 --> 41:11.403
Yeah.

41:11.423 --> 41:22.074
By the time we got finished,

41:11.423 --> 41:22.074
they were in control of all our people.

41:22.094 --> 41:27.139
Each had a good grasp

41:22.094 --> 41:27.139
of the fundamentals.

41:30.190 --> 41:31.371
each of the areas.

41:36.796 --> 41:43.563
And they were prepared to go back and teach their 
own commands of people. These things. And then

41:45.124 --> 41:52.451
after we left, sometime later, for the next four 
years, I suppose, there were people who followed

41:45.124 --> 41:52.451
us in there. Which means that they continued to do 
more and more of the same thing that we had started.

42:04.295 --> 42:11.727
The problem with those folks is that they were 
restricted by the same politicians that

42:04.295 --> 42:11.727
restricted the Americans.

42:14.311 --> 42:20.521
For every captain, you had a Captain Harvey. For 
every lieutenant, for every sergeant, for every

42:20.541 --> 42:27.592
so on, you had a complimentary ticket there. But 
they're all restricted by that same command.

42:32.948 --> 42:41.599
And since we held the biggest stake,

42:32.948 --> 42:41.599
our politicians overrode their politicians. Now 
even though you were in their country, and even

42:41.619 --> 42:59.321
though you were

42:41.619 --> 42:59.321
supposed to be there to observe and teach, their 
commanders were the ones who were supposed to be

42:41.619 --> 42:59.321
running the operations. But for years, they 
didn't have the ability. They didn't have

43:03.610 --> 43:08.275
wherewithal to go out and lead their people. They 
didn't have the horsepower to do it.

43:16.745 --> 43:24.634
Well, I think basically they had the knowledge and 
they had the training to get it done. But they were

43:24.654 --> 43:30.161
restricted by the same thing

43:24.654 --> 43:30.161
we were. I don't care if it was their country or not. 
Our

43:32.770 --> 43:59.864
government ran it. Do you feel that, at the Gulf of 
Tonkin, Johnson maybe should have requested

44:02.302 --> 44:10.215
declaration of war and then had a draft or called 
the National Guard. I'm glad he did.

44:17.667 --> 44:22.234
He had to have declared

44:17.667 --> 44:22.234
war. It might have changed the complexion of 
everything. At least when we say, OK, it's war. We

44:30.348 --> 44:35.816
have a tendency then to go on and fight it. But when 
we tell the American people that it's a police

44:35.836 --> 44:43.827
action, and Korea was never called a war. It was a 
police action. We had the opportunity to change

44:48.193 --> 44:50.856
that thing and to end it. Because of vacillation, 
we ended up getting our fanny kicked.

45:00.453 --> 45:12.852
and you've declared war at that time and made a 
mindset that we were going to do something about

45:00.453 --> 45:12.852
it, I believe it would have changed the 
complexion. At least it would have changed a lot of

45:12.872 --> 45:19.001
the direction, maybe.

45:19.021 --> 45:26.293
And that's really the reason I'm saying that the 
politicians created the monster. And I don't

45:26.313 --> 45:27.895
think any of them did it. I

45:29.630 --> 45:41.268
don't think any of them had a mind to create such a 
problem. I think most of them acted with good

45:41.288 --> 45:43.451
conscience.

45:46.916 --> 45:53.726
But the majority of the politicians that even are 
in office today have not fought, ever fought.

45:55.249 --> 45:56.751
They've always been politicians.

46:00.511 --> 46:03.956
The vice president-elect, what did he do? He's old 
enough to have been. What did he do during that

46:07.181 --> 46:08.884
period of time? Now here he is, he's going to be in 
charge? At least the president-elect knows what

46:11.728 --> 46:18.118
it is to go fight.

46:18.138 --> 46:22.705
We've got entirely too much of that in this 
country. How they got to be what they are is because

46:22.725 --> 46:28.273
they're politicians. with the American people. 
We keep electing guys that

46:31.894 --> 46:42.468
talk a good fight but have never fought a fight.

46:42.488 --> 46:50.618
And if we're going to go around and do the busy work 
of the world, then we better have warriors in

46:42.488 --> 46:50.618
charge. At least they know what it is to get their 
nose bloodied. And I don't want some powder puff

46:55.605 --> 47:00.471
ever again telling me who I ought to duke it out 
with. I'll fight for this country, and I'll do

47:01.953 --> 47:06.418
whatever's necessary for this country. But I 
won't do it because some little snot nose that had

47:06.438 --> 47:17.412
his pampers changed all the way through college 
tells me to go do it.

47:17.432 --> 47:20.576
First place, his grasp of what's going on around 
him isn't too great. His grasp of what's going on

47:23.079 --> 47:26.543
around me is absolutely absurd.

47:33.543 --> 47:36.768
Yeah, but Johnson would have declared the war. If 
he had declared it a war, America would have been

47:36.788 --> 47:42.115
in, good, bad, or whatever. At least the direction 
would have been determined, as it was. And as it

47:49.426 --> 47:52.310
turned out, we never had direction. It was whoever 
was talking the loudest. And the people, I

47:56.115 --> 48:01.002
believe, who were war protesters... were 
protesting not necessarily about war as they were

48:01.336 --> 48:18.838
about the direction things were going in our boys 
and people and guys who were protesting for

48:01.336 --> 48:18.838
instance they were protesting because they were 
either going to have to go or some of their friends

48:01.336 --> 48:18.838
and brothers
