00:02.647 --> 00:09.919
Well, as I was saying, Mr. Burnett, the whole 
community really was ready to pull together, and

00:02.647 --> 00:09.919
they did pull together. They supported the school 
and supported us tremendously well. And I might

00:13.885 --> 00:23.280
add, I think our coaching didn't hurt anything, 
because for the first time in, I guess, Anderson's

00:13.885 --> 00:23.280
history, we had a winning basketball team and a 
winning softball team. We had a good track team,

00:23.761 --> 00:27.928
but our star track man was blind in one eye. And when 
they put him in a lane, he would veer across all the

00:28.415 --> 00:33.722
other lanes and invariably become disqualified. 
He could run faster than everybody, even though he

00:33.762 --> 00:38.789
ran twice as far, but he never won anything much. So 
I enjoyed myself in Anderson. I made many good

00:42.174 --> 00:43.556
friends there. I did a great deal of hunting and 
fishing in the community and took part in

00:43.576 --> 00:49.324
community life and community church work. And my 
wife and I really, truly enjoyed our four years at

00:49.364 --> 00:53.950
Anderson. I came to Texas A&M University on 
November the 1st, 1939. I had not particularly

01:01.065 --> 01:10.119
cared about leaving Anderson unless I could go to a 
college or university somewhere because I was

01:01.065 --> 01:10.119
quite happy in Anderson. But a series, a chain of 
circumstances made it such that during the summer

01:11.101 --> 01:20.275
I came over to A&M and visited with Dr. George 
Summey, who was then head of the English

01:21.065 --> 01:26.911
Department at Texas A&M. Dr. Summey was a close 
friend of Dr. LL Click, who was my major professor

01:26.931 --> 01:43.147
at Austin while I was working during the summers of 
35, 6, 7, and 8 on my master's degree, which I did, in

01:26.931 --> 01:43.147
fact, receive in English from the University of 
Texas in Austin in the summer of 1938. Dr. Click had

01:43.307 --> 01:48.733
told me, if you ever happen to be in College 
Station, go by and visit Dr. Summey. He's a fine

01:48.753 --> 01:49.674
man. He and his wife are wonderful people. They are 
Virginians. So I was interested and did, in fact,

01:53.027 --> 01:58.331
just drop by to visit Dr. Summey with my wife. And 
while I was there, he encouraged me to put an

01:59.412 --> 02:03.296
application with him. He said he had no openings at 
the time, but that if one turned up, he thought he

02:03.316 --> 02:14.006
would love to have me, that Dr. Click had written a 
very nice letter to him about me, and he was glad I'd

02:03.316 --> 02:14.006
come by. So this was all rather informal and 
incidental, and I didn't think much of it. But

02:19.402 --> 02:39.521
after I had started work in Anderson and had worked 
for a month, along about October the 27th or 28th, I

02:19.402 --> 02:39.521
got a phone call from Dr. Summey saying that one of 
his young instructors had terminated his

02:19.402 --> 02:39.521
contract and that he needed an immediate 
replacement and could I come as an acting

02:19.402 --> 02:39.521
instructor in English at Texas A&M University. To 
me, this seemed like a great opportunity. And

02:42.785 --> 02:48.430
indeed, after the years have gone by, I will say I 
still think it was a great opportunity. And I am

02:48.832 --> 02:51.575
glad that I accepted the job. I had a hard time 
talking the school board in Anderson into letting

02:52.096 --> 03:00.125
us both go because my wife, by this time, was 
teaching in the grades in Anderson. And they were

03:00.145 --> 03:03.769
rather hard put to it to find a replacement. But 
they did feel, I think, that having a teacher there

03:03.789 --> 03:15.582
in Anderson who was hired by a major university 
from this small school was a tribute to the school.

03:16.034 --> 03:25.409
And so after some discussion, they agreed to let me 
terminate my contract with them and let me come on

03:16.034 --> 03:25.409
over to Texas A&M University. This I did on 
November the 1st, 1939, and joined the Department

03:26.411 --> 03:31.960
of English. In those days, A&M was, I must say, not 
at all the sort of school it is now. The campus

03:39.332 --> 03:42.717
was... I won't say it was a sea of mud, but there were 
very few sidewalks. The winters were very wet and

03:47.434 --> 03:50.539
quite often cold. And one got the impression much 
of the time that he was just simply slopping

03:51.260 --> 03:59.031
through mud from place to place, no matter where he 
went on the campus. Many of the buildings were

03:59.692 --> 04:04.419
rather old and antiquated as far as heating and so 
on were concerned. There was no such thing as air

04:04.439 --> 04:08.805
conditioning and all the comforts that people now 
know. And life wasn't primitive. I mean, we

04:12.226 --> 04:14.989
weren't living in tents or shacks. There were some 
shacks that we taught in. But nevertheless, it was

04:16.871 --> 04:20.616
a rather small campus. I just remember the exact 
enrollment at the time. I would say in the

04:22.959 --> 04:25.922
neighborhood of 6,000, something of this sort. 
And naturally, all core members, that is, all

04:26.423 --> 04:38.758
students were members of the core ROTC, with the 
exception of a very few people who were

04:26.423 --> 04:38.758
handicapped and could not participate. However, 
it was an all male, all core, highly traditional,

04:38.857 --> 04:48.049
small land grant college that I joined as a member 
of the English staff. I could talk for a long time

04:50.312 --> 04:57.382
about some of the sort of interesting things that 
went on. There was the old Cave of the Winds, which

04:57.402 --> 05:08.256
had something like eight or ten of the young 
people, young men in the department, instructors

04:57.402 --> 05:08.256
and assistant professors, had their desks in the 
same room. And when each one had a student sitting

05:08.692 --> 05:24.490
in front of him, was trying to go over a paper with 
the student, and two were talking, and one was

05:08.692 --> 05:24.490
playing some sort of a recorder, and one was 
hammering on the edge of his desk, something of

05:08.692 --> 05:24.490
this sort, it really sounded like the Tower of 
Babel. And how anybody got anything done under

05:24.510 --> 05:29.516
conditions like this, I don't know. Still, we did 
manage to do the job. I think did a very good job,

05:33.447 --> 05:35.429
really. English department at that time had no 
graduate programs at all. We were primarily a

05:39.854 --> 05:42.457
service department. That is to say, we taught the 
basic English courses, freshman composition,

05:42.497 --> 05:51.527
logic, which I'm sorry to say has rather 
disappeared from the curriculum now. It was a good

05:51.547 --> 05:52.508
course. Both I and my colleagues and our students, 
I think, enjoyed course in pure logic.

06:01.595 --> 06:08.581
literature courses of various types, both 
American and English literature, and an

06:01.595 --> 06:08.581
undergraduate degree program. But we had no 
graduate operation. All of the teachers were

06:11.443 --> 06:17.649
full-time teachers, and most of them were 
experienced teachers. And I do think that

06:17.849 --> 06:31.180
this was probably a good thing, because it brought 
the students there all under the tutelage of

06:17.849 --> 06:31.180
experienced people who were heavily loaded who 
were, however, dedicated to teaching. They were

06:35.394 --> 06:42.045
not concerned with research of any sort because 
there was no time for it and really no purpose in it.

06:42.806 --> 06:51.501
And it was a teaching institution so far as the 
English department was concerned at that time,

06:42.806 --> 06:51.501
though of course it has changed greatly in the 
years that have gone by. Some of the interesting

06:52.743 --> 06:56.830
places that were, that I remember were cases the 
little coffee shop down under the YMCA building.

07:01.582 --> 07:13.214
And many of the old Aggies I know will remember 
cases where students and faculty alike gathered

07:01.582 --> 07:13.214
for coffee and talk and so on, in a sort of a dim, Ross 
Geller on a small scale atmosphere. And the old

07:13.875 --> 07:23.865
Aggieland Inn, opposite, straight across the 
street from where Sabisa Hall now stands,

07:13.875 --> 07:23.865
approximately in front of the hospital. Now this 
was a beautiful building. And it was also a hotel,

07:26.392 --> 07:31.578
and the only one on the campus. It had rooms for 
visitors, not very many rooms. It had a lovely

07:35.042 --> 07:46.675
downstairs coffee shop, and virtually all the 
faculty members would go there at some time in the

07:35.042 --> 07:46.675
morning to sit around a big horseshoe-shaped bar 
and talk to their neighbors.

07:49.459 --> 07:52.382
The core life was very interesting. rigorous for 
the students. I often thank God I had not been an

07:54.818 --> 08:05.893
Aggie student when I would walk by some of the dorms 
and literally hear the splat, splat, splat of the

07:54.818 --> 08:05.893
board going on in the corridors. Hazing was 
forbidden by regulation, but it was carried on

08:06.533 --> 08:15.024
both considerably and regularly at that time. And 
the upperclassmen had many, many traditions and

08:18.215 --> 08:26.465
rules and regulations and restrictions designed 
to harden and mold the younger freshmen. I have

08:27.286 --> 08:33.094
never really decided what my opinion of the core 
life is. I certainly can see that in many ways it's

08:33.114 --> 08:43.767
valuable on the basis that if a young man could 
survive the rigors of core life and did survive

08:33.114 --> 08:43.767
these rigors, Then he felt a sense of courage and 
perhaps the ability to survive anywhere. And I

08:50.618 --> 08:52.761
have heard old Aggies say just that. That is, that 
simply knowing that they had survived four years

08:53.202 --> 09:07.423
of corps life in A&M and come out perhaps a corps 
leader or a staff officer in the corps had given

08:53.202 --> 09:07.423
them the feeling that they could make it anywhere 
they went under any conditions. On the other hand,

09:08.144 --> 09:10.648
I have seen. a number of students, good students, 
literally ruined by the core life, emotionally

09:10.882 --> 09:28.581
and physically and intellectually seriously 
hurt because they were not geared for this sort of

09:10.882 --> 09:28.581
thing and yet were forced into a mold and a pattern 
which they weren't fitted for. And some of them, I

09:29.021 --> 09:39.252
have a feeling, never really recovered from the 
scars of going through what to them was years of

09:29.021 --> 09:39.252
absolute torture and degradation in the core. So, 
like any other human institution, I guess we could

09:39.552 --> 09:46.979
say that the old corps at least had values and it had 
serious defects. The corps life has changed a

09:47.839 --> 09:52.363
great deal now and I know very little about it. It is 
a relatively small portion of present day A&M life

09:52.443 --> 10:07.737
because it represents, oh, I don't know, not more 
than 11 or 12 percent of the total student body at

09:52.443 --> 10:07.737
this time. As I stayed through the 1940s, I might 
digress a little to say that I went for a summer or

10:09.792 --> 10:24.475
two to the University of Wisconsin proposing to 
work on a PhD degree in English at the University of

10:09.792 --> 10:24.475
Wisconsin. And I had some very fine teachers there 
and was enjoying my work. But World War II

10:28.501 --> 10:34.510
interrupted this, and I never went back to work on a 
PhD degree. I never received one. In 1941, on July

10:36.556 --> 10:43.826
the 3rd, a very happy and interesting experience 
occurred to me. My only child and only son was born.

10:47.331 --> 10:54.541
Well,

10:47.331 --> 10:54.541
he is now Dr. Justin E. Kidd. And much against his 
father's wishes, he majored in English at the

10:55.302 --> 11:04.875
University of Virginia, received his PhD in 1973 
in English at that fine old institution up in our

11:05.665 --> 11:10.011
home part of the country. And he is now an assistant 
professor of English on the staff of Louisiana

11:10.692 --> 11:16.320
State University in Shreveport. I might go a 
little further to say that he has two lovely

11:17.342 --> 11:21.688
daughters. My granddaughter is Julie, now age 
nine, and Helen, now age eight. And recently, my

11:28.438 --> 11:34.727
first grandson and his first son, Mr. James Edward 
Kidd, who, as I speak, is 12 days old, and a very fine

11:35.078 --> 11:44.110
baby as babies go, if I do say so. Well, Justin was 
born, and I was coming along in the Department of

11:45.152 --> 11:49.257
English. I had advanced by 19 and 41 to the rank of 
instructor, was no longer an acting instructor.

11:59.331 --> 12:04.478
And I had found an interest in radio writing, radio 
production. Texas A&M then owned its own radio

12:06.721 --> 12:20.835
station and I worked on a contract basis in 
producing, writing and producing a number of

12:06.721 --> 12:20.835
radio series. Some of these were under contract to 
the Texas Education Agency. I remember one series

12:27.401 --> 12:30.264
we did was called Jobs Ahead. We did this series of 
13 shows per semester, I believe there were 26

12:35.558 --> 12:40.363
shows a year once a week for the long session. And we 
wrote the scripts for this. These were career

12:43.325 --> 12:51.233
orientation shows aimed at the high schools and 
junior high schools of the state of Texas. And we

12:51.873 --> 12:54.576
dramatized various kinds of careers. And then we 
had a little group of students and student wives

12:54.656 --> 13:03.304
and faculty wives and interested students, just 
people who were interested in radio. And they made

13:03.554 --> 13:06.017
up our cast, and they were very good. Many of them 
have gone into commercial radio and TV work and

13:06.077 --> 13:10.222
have done well. This was an all-volunteer cast, 
and I was the director, and we did it all in the old

13:10.242 --> 13:17.950
station and had some very fine times. Another 
series that we did was called Texas Turns to

13:18.831 --> 13:32.447
Science, which dramatized recent scientific 
discoveries and researches carried on through

13:18.831 --> 13:32.447
the research arm of Texas A&M University. Still 
another series, which was very successful, was

13:33.153 --> 13:37.378
called Man to Man. It was a series of 13 shows, I 
believe, if I remember correctly, based on

13:38.019 --> 13:50.455
industrial case histories in the field of human 
engineering or human relations. The basis for

13:50.475 --> 13:55.882
this was some studies that had been carried on by 
the Texas Engineering Extension Service. They

13:56.242 --> 14:00.848
had a number of case histories, problems that had 
come up in actual industries and businesses. We

14:01.148 --> 14:07.055
dramatized these and set them in dramatic form and 
presented them. Now, all these shows were

14:07.216 --> 14:09.619
presented live over the air. We had something like 
40 or 45 stations carrying these shows on good time

14:09.759 --> 14:18.890
and got very good reception from all the series. We 
were real proud of our series. This man-to-man

14:20.772 --> 14:23.516
show was extremely successful. As I recall, it was 
picked up by a number of the major airlines and some

14:29.785 --> 14:37.634
of the manufacturing companies and others who 
bought the tapes to play to their employees and

14:29.785 --> 14:37.634
their supervisors, foremen and what have you. And 
we thought this was a good show. I also had got

14:42.319 --> 14:59.117
interested in creative writing and was doing a 
little creative writing on the side and was lucky

14:42.319 --> 14:59.117
enough to sell a number of short stories to such 
commercial magazines as Field and Stream, Argosy

14:42.319 --> 14:59.117
Magazine, Rod and Gun in Canada, Giant Western, 
other magazines of this sort. And I was also

15:02.024 --> 15:21.414
writing some more literary-type short stories, 
things which were non-commercial but which were

15:02.024 --> 15:21.414
stories of some literary merit, I guess, because 
three of the short stories I wrote received

15:02.024 --> 15:21.414
mention as distinctive American short stories of 
the year in the several years of the Foley

15:02.024 --> 15:21.414
anthologies. And some, one of them at least, was 
picked up for anthologizing in a anthology of

15:28.915 --> 15:34.262
short stories edited by the late Dr. William Perry 
of the University of Texas. And in this anthology,

15:34.842 --> 15:47.017
my story, which was called Low Road Go Down, was in 
company with some of the great Texas writers,

15:34.842 --> 15:47.017
Dobie and Gibson and others, Katherine Ann Porter 
and so on. And I really felt that this was a major

15:47.077 --> 15:50.341
tribute. This same story was anthologized in a 
textbook, which was used as a text in a survey of

15:57.029 --> 16:01.314
literature in a number of colleges and 
institutions. And so I did get some literary

16:02.316 --> 16:16.334
recognition from these stories, but after a while 
the main played out and I seemed to lose the touch

16:02.316 --> 16:16.334
somehow or other and didn't do much more fiction 
writing. I did, however, do a great deal of

16:16.995 --> 16:22.041
contract writing for various agencies here 
located on the campus of Texas Forest Service,

16:22.392 --> 16:40.039
Texas Engineering Experiment Station, and other 
agencies, and I found I had all the summer work that

16:22.392 --> 16:40.039
I could possibly handle offered me long before the 
summers came just to write for various agencies.

16:40.059 --> 16:51.015
World War I was a very sad and agonizing time, and 
many of my good friends and fine A&M students died,

16:40.059 --> 16:51.015
and I was saddened with the news of each death My 
wife's only brother, my only brother-in-law,

16:51.535 --> 17:02.508
Robert Canterbury, who was also a student at A&M in 
his sophomore year when war broke out, went off

16:51.535 --> 17:02.508
with his friends to service, and he was killed 
overseas. And the names of all my friends and my

17:03.309 --> 17:17.666
students who died are on the plaque over at the MSC, 
and I never passed this without reliving some of

17:03.309 --> 17:17.666
the misery and horror of this time, which people of 
this vantage shared. I, myself, thought that I

17:19.818 --> 17:22.140
would go into the Navy. But before my commission, 
which was on the way from Washington, could come

17:22.180 --> 17:38.435
through, I was frozen here at A&M and spent the war 
years right here teaching mathematics and

17:22.180 --> 17:38.435
elementary cryptography to ASTP trainees, Navy 
trainees, and so on. After the war, I continued to

17:40.077 --> 17:43.480
teach and do contract writing. In 1968, I became 
assistant to the dean of the graduate college. and

17:49.619 --> 17:53.743
in 1972 became assistant dean of the Graduate 
College. My present job is assistant dean of the

17:54.844 --> 17:57.527
Graduate College. I teach two sections of speech 
403 in the long semesters and do not teach it all in

17:57.547 --> 18:06.817
the summertime, but devote my time to the work of 
the Graduate College. I will say that my work in the

18:07.778 --> 18:17.027
Graduate College, which takes up about really 
most of my time, is work which I enjoy perhaps more

18:07.778 --> 18:17.027
than anything I've ever done. It is work of a 
general administrative nature. And I work very

18:21.246 --> 18:23.690
closely with Dean George Kunze. And I'm very proud 
of our graduate college, of its growth and

18:24.391 --> 18:36.788
development since it became autonomous in 1968 
when Dean Kunze took over as dean, and Dean Leo

18:24.391 --> 18:36.788
Berner, and now associate dean. And I joined him as 
the three executive deans of the graduate

18:36.949 --> 18:43.538
college. We have a grand staff. It's the finest 
group of people anyone could possibly hope to work

18:46.063 --> 18:49.948
with. They're dedicated to the work. They know 
what they're doing. Time means nothing to them in

18:53.311 --> 18:57.296
terms of getting the job done. And I think that the 
success and growth of the Graduate College, and I

18:57.897 --> 19:11.652
want to put this on record, is due primarily to Dean 
Kunze's terrific personal leadership qualities

18:57.897 --> 19:11.652
and his organizational ability. When he became 
dean, the work of the Graduate College was a rather

19:12.020 --> 19:18.408
scattered and chaotic sort of thing. Graduate 
enrollment was in the neighborhood of 2,000 or

19:19.009 --> 19:24.737
2,100, perhaps not quite that many. But the whole 
program was diversified and scattered and not

19:25.738 --> 19:32.286
well organized at all, in my opinion. He brought 
organization and order into the whole thing, and

19:33.648 --> 19:38.955
he, Dr. Charles Pennell and Mr. Lester Wood 
developed the only computerized graduate

19:39.475 --> 19:58.861
student record keeping system in the nation, 
which now carries all of the records of the

19:39.475 --> 19:58.861
graduate college and the individual students 
from the moment of admission to the moment of

19:39.475 --> 19:58.861
graduation on the computer. Any student and any 
advisor, any member of the graduate faculty can

19:59.461 --> 20:07.592
find out instantly exactly where his student is, 
what he's doing, part of the program he is in, when

20:07.960 --> 20:17.136
he may be expected to graduate, what his 
deficiencies are, what his financial supports

20:07.960 --> 20:17.136
are, and so on. This system has attracted 
nationwide interest. Dean Kunze has several

20:23.006 --> 20:29.277
times been asked to present it before the Council 
of Graduate Schools in the United States. And

20:29.818 --> 20:33.023
graduate deans from all over the country have come 
here to look at it and to envy it, to be frank about

20:33.256 --> 20:36.760
it. I don't think that there's another 
institution of higher learning in this country

20:36.900 --> 20:52.038
which has perfected its computerization of its 
graduate student record keeping to the degree

20:36.900 --> 20:52.038
that A&M has under Dean Kunze's leadership and 
supervision. And Dean Kunze has been recognized

20:52.058 --> 20:58.386
by the national graduate community for his work 
here. He has served on a number of accreditation

20:58.720 --> 21:04.890
teams for the Southern Association of Colleges 
and Schools. He's been chairman of these teams,

21:04.910 --> 21:15.607
just recently has returned from a visit of an 
accreditation team to an institution in Georgia,

21:04.910 --> 21:15.607
of which he was the chairman of the team. He has 
recently been the only graduate dean in the nation

21:16.468 --> 21:25.943
appointed to a blue ribbon federal commission 
charged with looking into the issue of

21:26.547 --> 21:32.854
affirmative action in employment among 
institutions of higher education in this

21:26.547 --> 21:32.854
country. And his associates on this commission 
are such men as the president of Harvard,

21:33.515 --> 21:46.731
president of Princeton, the president of 
Michigan State, and other outstanding

21:33.515 --> 21:46.731
educational leaders, both men and women. This is a 
very important committee, and it's a tribute to

21:46.771 --> 21:52.918
Dean Kunze that he's been chosen to do this work. 
He's a grand person to work with. And believe me, I

21:55.640 --> 22:01.729
feel that A&M is very, very lucky to have him. I 
might add he is an ex-Agin, a survivor of the old

22:01.749 --> 22:04.953
Corps. And perhaps he would not share my total 
opinions of the Corps. Nevertheless, he's a great

22:10.902 --> 22:13.566
product of A&M. He has his PhD from Penn State 
University. Now, Mr. Burnett, this sort of brings

22:18.493 --> 22:21.297
me up to date. If you have any questions you'd like 
to ask me in the remaining time, go ahead.

22:27.685 --> 22:33.795
Mr. Kidd, a big change that you saw come to Texas A&M 
was coeducation. What are your thoughts on that?

22:36.680 --> 22:45.575
Well, my thoughts, of course, Mr. Burnett, are 
that I approve very highly of the coming of

22:36.680 --> 22:45.575
coeducation to Texas A&M University. When I came 
here, A&M was, of course, an all-male

22:46.937 --> 22:53.929
institution, and I taught under these 
circumstances for a quarter of a century. And I

22:54.280 --> 22:55.767
thought it was a great school. I was fond of the boys 
and so on. But I felt also all this time that

22:57.535 --> 23:03.784
coeducation, would in time be inevitable if A&M 
were to achieve a true status of major university.

23:11.689 --> 23:18.600
I know there was a great deal of opposition at all 
levels, both from the students, from old Aggies,

23:11.689 --> 23:18.600
and from some people who were not Aggies. And 
strangely enough, from many women who felt that

23:19.241 --> 23:26.571
this would be a very bad thing for girls to come to 
A&M. But the change was made over a period of time.

23:30.457 --> 23:32.320
And with some struggle and distress, And now I 
think everybody has accepted it very, very well

23:32.637 --> 23:36.002
indeed. We have something like 7,000 girls and a 
fair portion of these in the graduate school. I

23:41.730 --> 23:42.612
teach girls. There are girls in the class with you. 
And I will say this, that these girls perform at a

23:44.795 --> 23:49.642
very high level. They are good students. They're 
capable. And they are career-oriented in that

23:52.326 --> 23:55.370
sense. I mean, they probably will marry and so on, 
but they intend to use what they learn at college.

24:00.802 --> 24:06.148
and to make a career and also to marry and have 
children. And I think they're very high quality

24:06.168 --> 24:08.870
people. They're very good people. And I think it's 
been very good for the school to have them. And it

24:12.814 --> 24:22.785
has brought an atmosphere of wholeness and what I 
would think of as a university type atmosphere to

24:12.814 --> 24:22.785
A&M. And of course, I think it is certainly a major 
factor in the recent astounding growth of the

24:22.805 --> 24:28.851
institution. and the development of the 
institution is the coming of the girls and women to

24:29.135 --> 24:34.921
A&M, and I'm all for it. Mr. Kidd, just in the three 
years that I've been here, I've seen A&M grow just

24:36.063 --> 24:45.013
extremely fast. All the buildings popping up and 
the number of students is increasing. What are

24:52.321 --> 24:53.504
your thoughts on this? How big do you think A&M can 
get? Do you think anything is suffering because of

24:56.430 --> 25:00.238
its size, or is it improving? Well, so far I think 
the programs are good programs, and they're

25:00.318 --> 25:05.048
working. And the proof of the fact that they're 
working is that A&M graduates not only are placed

25:07.373 --> 25:19.965
well, that is, they do get jobs and get jobs perhaps 
more easily thanks to a fine placement service

25:07.373 --> 25:19.965
than the graduates of many other schools. But the 
important thing is that they do well in these jobs.

25:23.508 --> 25:28.833
The history of A&M graduates everywhere is a 
history of success by and large. They contribute

25:29.214 --> 25:30.515
well. They're good citizens. They live well. And I 
think this is fine. Now, I do think that there

25:36.700 --> 25:43.432
probably is an upper limit to the growth that we can 
tolerate because both of space and facilities.

25:44.053 --> 25:51.786
And I don't think that we have the space, 
literally, for the necessary labs and the

25:44.053 --> 25:51.786
classrooms and so on. And of course, there is a 
point of no return. I don't know just where that

25:54.491 --> 25:58.879
point is, but I do know that The administration and 
the Board of Regents are probably taking a very

25:58.859 --> 26:10.438
hard look at the 30,000 figure as a potential 
maximum for at least the coming few years. And

26:10.598 --> 26:16.648
strangely enough, I have a feeling we may well 
reach that 30,000 figure within the next two or

26:10.598 --> 26:16.648
three years. So I don't know where we go from there. 
There are buildings and so forth on the drawing

26:19.940 --> 26:26.630
boards, but it takes some years for them to be 
constructed. And I just really don't know what the

26:27.131 --> 26:30.777
upshot will be. I think right now we're in a good 
position as far as growth is concerned.

26:38.617 --> 26:41.921
Well, Mr. Kidd, I've been extremely interested in 
your talk. I really appreciate your help here in

26:41.941 --> 26:45.787
this project. I'm glad to get it on tape, and it's 
going to be some interesting information.

26:55.159 --> 26:55.459
All right. Well, thank you, Mr. Burnett, and I was 
glad to help you.
