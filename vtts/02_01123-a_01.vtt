WEBVTT

00:02.292 --> 00:02.933
All yours. All right. Well, my name's Skip Porter. 
In the birth records, you'll see Wilbur Arthur. I

00:15.025 --> 00:15.886
saw that somewhere. Who is that? So some time ago, 
we standardized on W. Arthur for kind of the

00:17.067 --> 00:22.293
formal. But most people that know me call me Skip. 
Born in Texas. Born in Irving, Texas.

00:31.891 --> 00:42.601
Grew up in the state, educated here at North Texas 
State, bachelor's and master's in physics there,

00:31.891 --> 00:42.601
and then did a PhD work at Texas A&M in lunch 
engineering or interdisciplinary engineering.

00:45.104 --> 00:47.486
Worked in the R&D labs of Texas Instruments. In 
Dallas? In Dallas. In Dallas. In the mid-60s, back

00:51.310 --> 00:59.738
during the first large-scale integration, first 
LSI days of the integrated circuit world. Those

01:00.342 --> 01:02.224
were exciting times, I guess. Uh-huh, they were. 
And

01:03.205 --> 01:21.846
Texas A&M was interested in establishing a 
microelectronics program and asked me to do that,

01:03.205 --> 01:21.846
and I took a leave of absence from the R&D labs at 
Texas Instruments. Who had you worked in with in EE

01:21.866 --> 01:25.810
at A&M? I worked closely with, well at the time we 
got him Bill Jones. I know Bill very well. Was the

01:32.467 --> 01:33.488
department head. And John Linder was on the 
faculty at that time, and Albert Druce.

01:44.885 --> 01:50.133
Then all the kind of young guys, so to speak, that 
came in at once. We got him Roland Hayden and Jack

01:50.234 --> 01:53.198
Stone. and John Linder and myself. They were kind 
of the four solid state electronic guys. So I did

02:04.209 --> 02:04.950
that. I worked, and actually I came back to Texas 
A&M in 1968 on leave to finish up my PhD. I'd come to

02:13.302 --> 02:19.371
Texas A&M in 64 from North Texas. with a master's in 
physics, and it started on my PhD in physics at

02:20.043 --> 02:25.008
Texas A&M. I was there for two years teaching in 
math and physics as an instructor while I did my PhD

02:25.028 --> 02:32.995
work. And I finished my coursework and kind of ran 
out of gas for going to school. That happens. Yeah.

02:41.884 --> 02:48.430
And so I left Texas A&M in 66. June of 66. I always 
remember my starting date, Texas Instruments was

02:50.174 --> 02:56.444
6-6-66. Is that right? That's good. That's an easy 
way to remember, yeah. And so, you know, I had been

03:01.231 --> 03:14.451
toying with various ways to finish my PhD, either 
at SMU or North Texas, and then went A&M. asked that

03:14.785 --> 03:19.451
I come to the EE department to help start up this 
microelectronics program. I agreed to do that,

03:19.892 --> 03:34.090
took a leave from TI, went back to Texas A&M on the EE 
faculty as an assistant professor, and took a

03:19.892 --> 03:34.090
technician that had been working with me at Texas 
Instruments. And we started actually physically

03:35.311 --> 03:40.658
building in the old Bolton Hall, Texas A&M's first 
facility to do research in semiconductor device

03:41.262 --> 03:46.890
fabrication. High technology. High technology. 
Comes to Aggieland. Yeah. That's interesting.

03:53.119 --> 03:55.863
And so I put that laboratory together. I'm sure 
physically you did it. Oh, I built it. I mean, you

03:58.687 --> 03:59.769
had to build it. Literally, yeah. Al Drewson. 
along with Leonard Dollarhide, who was the

04:01.816 --> 04:05.600
technician. Did you get support from Texas 
Instruments? No, this was $50,000 that TEAS, the

04:09.024 --> 04:18.554
Texas Engineering Experiment Station, which I 
ended up later directing, had put into the EE

04:09.024 --> 04:18.554
department. And actually, how it came up, 
curiously enough, was I was on campus recruiting

04:19.656 --> 04:25.182
for Texas Instruments. And Bill Jones called over 
to the recruiting office And when he learned that

04:30.908 --> 04:38.596
Texas Instruments was there recruiting, asking 
if anybody was there that could advise the EE

04:30.908 --> 04:38.596
department on how to spend this $50,000. And so I 
was asked. And I said, sure, I'll go over and talk to

04:42.100 --> 04:43.722
them. And so I went over. And at the end of the day, we 
went to dinner. And Jones and Drews asked me if I'd

04:48.567 --> 04:52.311
be willing to come on the faculty. So that's how it 
happened. And I told them no, I wasn't interested.

04:58.499 --> 05:04.507
appreciated the invitation, but I was on a pretty 
exciting project at TI, which was the continuous

04:58.499 --> 05:04.507
diffusion program. I was working then with Jack 
Kilby. Oh, so that was, okay. That's how Jack and I

05:09.273 --> 05:10.454
met. Jack was the director of the labs. I've always 
wondered how that happened. Well, he was the

05:13.738 --> 05:26.835
director of the labs, and we had this idea that if it 
was a great world, we could pour a bag of sand into a

05:13.738 --> 05:26.835
funnel and not touch anything and integrate 
circuits with I'll pop out the other end. And so my

05:28.707 --> 05:31.050
job was to design that system. And I was right in the 
middle of that and had actually applied for the

05:32.451 --> 05:42.423
patent on what we call the continuous diffusion 
system, which was the basis for the TI automated

05:32.451 --> 05:42.423
system for bill and aggregate circuits.

05:46.008 --> 05:53.076
But in a few weeks, maybe a few months, incubating 
that idea, It was something I knew I could help

05:53.883 --> 05:58.688
Texas A&M with. It provided a very concurrent, 
comfortable way for me to finish up my PhD. It

06:08.018 --> 06:17.968
required that I shift from physics to 
engineering, which was not a hard shift for me to

06:08.018 --> 06:17.968
make because I was kind of in device physics 
anyway. Texas A&M didn't really have a an applied

06:21.760 --> 06:24.182
physics degree. So what I did do was go into what was 
called, and still is as far as I know, if it still

06:25.223 --> 06:33.191
exists, the interdisciplinary engineering. And 
so my PhD is in interdisciplinary engineering.

06:37.074 --> 06:50.907
It's kind of a mastered combination of physics, 
math, chemistry, chemical engineering,

06:37.074 --> 06:50.907
mechanical engineering, and double E. And I had 
written a proposal to NASA for support for a

06:51.848 --> 07:04.003
research contract in the applications of space 
for semiconductor device manufacturing. And in

07:04.023 --> 07:17.881
70, when I pretty much had the laboratory together 
and had completed my PhD, I was interviewing with

07:04.023 --> 07:17.881
TI and with several other companies. So I was still 
on leave. And I got this contract, this research

07:20.333 --> 07:27.224
contract from Marshall Space Flight Center in 
Huntsville, Alabama. So A&M was most interested

07:28.025 --> 07:34.415
in me staying because it was a nice contract for the 
university to have.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.824
So you had to apply independently for that? Yeah. 
I'd just written the proposal. I was the principal

07:41.987 --> 07:46.915
investigator, and I'd just sent it in as a faculty 
member. I was in unusual circumstances. I was an

07:49.058 --> 07:53.484
assistant professor, but I was also a graduate 
student. I was finishing my PhD. But I wrote the

07:55.807 --> 07:58.812
proposal, sent it in, and got it. And that was 1970, 
which was a really tough time in the industry. TI

08:06.282 --> 08:11.670
was most pleased for me to continue to stay on 
leave. from TI, maintain the link with me at Texas

08:11.920 --> 08:21.830
A&M, but have me be an A&M employee. And I did that, 
and probably until the mid-70s before we finally,

08:21.850 --> 08:28.136
I finally said it. I didn't realize you had a big, 
long TI connection. Yeah. And I still do

08:33.682 --> 08:38.687
consulting work for TI up until that time off and 
on. And then we got some TI, sporadic and small as it

08:39.443 --> 08:45.348
was, support for the labs at A&M. So that was

08:47.710 --> 09:00.041
kind of the early 70s, and I maintained continuous 
support from NASA in the program they called

08:47.710 --> 09:00.041
Processing in Space Reuse on Earth. There were two 
of us in the country early on, a guy named Harry

09:02.543 --> 09:08.488
Gatiss, who was a professor at MIT, And Harry was 
looking at how to grow crystals. And I was looking

09:12.971 --> 09:27.666
at how to process silicon, the advantages of low 
gravity, the thermal environment with full

09:12.971 --> 09:27.666
thermal conductivity and radiation.

09:27.686 --> 09:35.995
So at any rate, that semiconductor device 
research support continued from NASA at A&M for

09:36.582 --> 09:43.272
quite a while, and that expanded in other areas. We 
got other contracts. I had a contract with the Rome

09:44.695 --> 10:01.240
Air Development Center Air Force support for 
similar kinds of defect analysis, and we were

09:44.695 --> 10:01.240
looking a lot at process-induced defects in 
silicon and their impact on the yield of

09:44.695 --> 10:01.240
integrated circuits. Now, are you doing any 
teaching at this time? Oh yeah, I'm full-time.

10:05.298 --> 10:06.099
Full-time teaching. I'm teaching big-time, 
heavy-duty state of Texas loads, like nine hours.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.165
In physics or engineering? No, in electrical 
engineering. In electrical engineering. Well,

10:15.327 --> 10:16.689
and in mechanical engineering. So we changed. It 
was a funny occurrence because, of course, I had

10:21.393 --> 10:30.501
been teaching both physics and math at A&M from 64 
to 66. And then I was at TI from 66 to 68, and then I was

10:30.987 --> 10:37.437
back at Texas A&M in 68. And somewhere in the early 
70s, I guess it was, or maybe it was in the late 60s,

10:39.039 --> 10:56.185
we switched because of all the complaining by the 
engineering students about how tough physics was

10:39.039 --> 10:56.185
and how many people were flunking, so that they 
could take mechanical engineering instead of

10:39.039 --> 10:56.185
physics. And then the M.E. department didn't have 
enough professors to teach the M.E. courses. So I

11:02.328 --> 11:03.810
got loaned to M.E. to teach M.E. for a while. So I 
taught a lot, a lot of different classes. And then I

11:08.397 --> 11:14.366
remember it really upset, what was the guy's name 
that was... In M.E.? Uh-huh. Not McDonald. No, he

11:16.609 --> 11:17.430
was the C.A. No, it was way before McDonald, 
though. He was an old Army guy, Simons or Bob...

11:26.810 --> 11:28.873
Crawford, no? Crawford was nuclear.

11:35.603 --> 11:36.624
I can't remember his name either. Bob's his first 
name. I'm sure he was a big, burly guy. But I flunked

11:40.930 --> 11:45.657
half of the ME class in that course, and that wasn't 
traditional over there either. Well, I used to

11:46.839 --> 11:48.261
teach physics. We got these kids that got up for 
farm. So that didn't turn out to help out much, but

11:51.585 --> 11:54.910
at any rate, So, yeah, I was teaching full-time, 
usually one or two graduate courses and or

11:56.847 --> 12:05.194
undergraduate courses. But having really 
focused on research, you were really good. Well,

12:07.296 --> 12:22.069
yeah, and then we established in the early 70s, 
somewhere, you have to go back to A&M for this

12:07.296 --> 12:22.069
history, the Institute for Solid State 
Electronics. And the first director was a guy

12:23.170 --> 12:25.352
named Roland Haight. And Roland headed up this 
institute, which the faculty members were the

12:26.834 --> 12:39.807
guys I mentioned earlier, Stone and Hayden and 
Linder and myself and Drush. And

12:41.589 --> 12:54.462
this faculty formed the members of the institute, 
which was a subset of the EE department. really had

12:54.745 --> 12:59.151
the responsibility for building the research 
programs and the laboratories. It

13:00.913 --> 13:09.804
was about in that period where we started 
designing the new engineering building, what's

13:00.913 --> 13:09.804
now the Zachry Engineering Center. Hayden left to 
take the chairmanship of EE, I think, at OU. and I

13:22.319 --> 13:28.788
was asked to become the director of the Institute 
for Solid State Electronics. And the new

13:28.808 --> 13:43.188
building, Fred Benson was dean of engineering 
then, and Fred asked me to come up with what we

13:28.808 --> 13:43.188
thought we could use facility-wise in the Zachry 
building, and so we designed the institute there.

13:45.210 --> 13:47.854
And so when we moved out of old Bolton Hall, into the 
new Zachary Center, we ended up with quite a

13:48.374 --> 14:15.445
first-class facility for the Institute for South 
State Electronics, and I brought in some other

13:48.374 --> 14:15.445
faculty members, Don Parker, and John Ignorian, 
and Raghav Pandey, and we began to build the

13:48.374 --> 14:15.445
faculty and the graduate students, and grew the 
center, the Institute, I guess at that time about a

14:16.488 --> 14:19.312
million dollars a year. And they're heavily 
research again, rather than teaching. You're

14:23.978 --> 14:25.821
getting into a real research complex. We're 
creating a strong effort in developing a strong

14:25.881 --> 14:34.593
graduate research program, an academic research 
environment, of course. A&M is just now going into

14:35.414 --> 14:38.098
that whole moment. That's right. And that was the 
challenge and the theme for A&M to try to become a

14:38.659 --> 14:44.487
major research university. So that moves us into 
about mid-70s. And it was in there that Kilby and I

14:51.232 --> 14:55.878
started. This was during the energy crisis, 
during the Carter days, during the long gas lines.

15:04.288 --> 15:10.836
And so we started a project to develop a new type of 
photovoltaic solar cell. And Kilby and I, a former

15:10.856 --> 15:15.081
colleague the labs at DI, Jay Lathrop, who's now 
gone as professor of electrical engineering at

15:15.365 --> 15:22.054
Clemson. But Jack and Jay and I started working on a 
new idea for a spherical solar cell, which we

15:23.135 --> 15:35.731
developed in the institute at A&M and patented. 
And Texas Instruments, who had retained a right of

15:37.113 --> 15:42.840
first refusal such projects that Jack backed. 
Jack had since left EI. He was operating as an

15:50.676 --> 15:52.638
independent inventor. But Jack and I had 
maintained our contacts and because we had this

15:54.541 --> 16:11.781
capability in the labs of the Institute at A&M, 
Jack and I started working,

15:54.541 --> 16:11.781
you know, we pulled out all the corks on this 
project. He's physically at A&M. No, he lives in

16:14.321 --> 16:19.469
Dallas, but he's coming, driving back and forth 
from Dallas to College Station. And gets a pretty

16:20.912 --> 16:32.892
good introduction to the university and the life 
of the people, and we gain a renewed professional

16:20.912 --> 16:32.892
interaction together. And we are successful at 
getting a $14 million DOE contract to support this

16:34.222 --> 16:43.655
work when we transfer it to TI. So that kind of 
re-establishes now, although I'm no longer on

16:43.675 --> 16:54.491
leave of absence from TI, it kind of 
re-establishes my contact back with TI through

16:43.675 --> 16:54.491
this project. And so then I start consulting again 
pretty heavily for TI in moving the technology

16:54.511 --> 17:03.283
from Texas A&M to the labs in Dallas at Texas 
Instruments. And several of the graduate

17:04.040 --> 17:09.284
students that I had working for me then become TI 
employees. And so that link, a guy named Randy

17:09.304 --> 17:21.715
McKee I think is still there, was one of my top 
graduate students at A&M, and worked closely with

17:09.304 --> 17:21.715
Jack and me when this project was in its formative 
stages at A&M. That's a good story, the

17:23.096 --> 17:27.259
transfusion between academia and industry. 
Well, and it's relevant to HARC.

17:31.883 --> 17:33.945
Because I have always personally been a strong 
believer that those two separate entities in our

17:35.512 --> 17:49.055
society could benefit far more from one another if 
they took the time to figure out how to work

17:35.512 --> 17:49.055
together. But the historical and traditional 
attitude in its fundamental sense In industry,

17:57.888 --> 18:03.274
that's an academic, I retire a bunch, stay away 
from them. In the academic community, that's

18:04.054 --> 18:08.980
those money, grubby, profit guys, stay away from 
them. And so it's very difficult to find a way to

18:09.881 --> 18:16.547
link the two, yet on an individual basis. I was 
intrigued. I very much enjoyed my experience at

18:19.250 --> 18:21.853
Texas Instruments. I very much enjoyed my 
experience at Texas A&M. clearly saw advantages

18:25.124 --> 18:29.188
to both if they could work together. And I had, just 
as an aside, but on a personal level, to the extent

18:29.268 --> 18:53.815
that that's interesting in this talk and this 
discussion,

18:29.268 --> 18:53.815
I had begun to consult for a little company in 
Portland, Oregon called Electro Scientific

18:29.268 --> 18:53.815
Industries, which was quite a small $5 million a 
year operation building laser systems to trim

18:29.268 --> 18:53.815
thin film resistors. These are resistors that are 
printed on a ceramic, and then you go in and trim the

18:54.031 --> 19:03.164
printed resistor to value. By shaving it off, you 
can increase the resistance. So they would trim

19:07.590 --> 19:15.101
it, cut it with a laser, and monitor the resistance 
and get it to just the value they wanted. And they

19:15.161 --> 19:23.633
were trying to expand their product line to get 
into the integrated circuit industry out of the

19:15.161 --> 19:23.633
hybrid industry only. And I ended up starting to 
consult for them while I was a professor at Texas

19:25.300 --> 19:31.507
A&M. This was a company way up in Portland, Oregon. 
They approached me at a conference in New York City

19:36.393 --> 19:49.468
where I'd given a paper on semiconductor device 
physics and the process of building integrated

19:36.393 --> 19:49.468
circuits.

19:50.022 --> 19:57.752
And as a result of that, we went to NSL to apply for 
support through the old RAND program. You may

19:57.772 --> 20:00.236
remember Research Applied to National Need. 
Tried to get support because that was designed for

20:01.217 --> 20:10.690
a small business to link with an academic research 
university to help develop a new product. But

20:12.812 --> 20:16.958
today, the bottom line is I'm chairman of the board 
of that company. And the company has grown to some

20:17.208 --> 20:29.049
$80 million a year and has market share worldwide 
on a laser system used to build a DRAM memory chip.

20:30.872 --> 20:34.598
And Jack Kilby is now also on the board of that 
company. So it's a small world. They come together

20:36.181 --> 20:38.946
and we keep the players. But that's just another 
example. The reason I mention that is that's a

20:42.148 --> 20:51.421
university-industry link that demonstrates the 
ability to make it work, that it can work. And so it

20:52.903 --> 21:08.224
was my hope for Texas A&M, A&M being what I believed 
the most aggressive major research institution

20:52.903 --> 21:08.224
in the state, in terms of seeking interaction with 
the pipe sector. A&M had much more of the image and

21:14.574 --> 21:20.160
tradition of having grease under their 
fingernails. This was the nuts and bolts of

21:20.180 --> 21:24.805
engineers. Roll up your sleeves, wait in there, 
and get it done kind of attitude. Well, that's what

21:28.469 --> 21:31.793
these NASA engineers talk about, hands-on 
engineering. Hands-on engineering. A&M drifted

21:33.074 --> 21:34.836
away from that some. We decided in some piece of the 
history that followed that we needed to look more

21:37.786 --> 21:44.092
like Harvard than MIT.

21:46.695 --> 22:07.675
But during the days when all of this was coming 
together, in engineering at least, this was while

21:46.695 --> 22:07.675
Fred Benson was dean,

21:46.695 --> 22:07.675
this work with Texas Instruments and 
Electro-Scientific Industries was very much

21:46.695 --> 22:07.675
positive and well received. That went on up 
through the 70s. I remained as a professor of

22:14.004 --> 22:33.628
electrical engineering, developing the 
research program, publishing hot and heavy,

22:14.004 --> 22:33.628
building a larger institute team of faculty and 
graduate students and chasing the support for the

22:14.004 --> 22:33.628
research grants. in order to establish Texas 
A&M's Institute for Solid State Electronics as a

22:34.351 --> 22:43.580
major national research facility in 
microelectronics. And in 1979,

22:45.422 --> 22:59.476
I

22:45.422 --> 22:59.476
was asked to take the directorship of the Texas 
Engineering Experiment Station. By Benson? By

23:00.177 --> 23:01.658
Benson, by Fred Benson. This was a tumultuous 
time, Henry, at A&M, as you'll recall. There was

23:08.497 --> 23:14.827
big changes on the horizon in the structure of the 
system and the presidency of the university. And

23:16.489 --> 23:22.218
I've been completely insulated. As most of the 
faculty, you're oblivious to all of that. You

23:25.483 --> 23:31.172
barely know who's president, and it's really not 
so important. You kind of live in your own world.

23:33.534 --> 23:34.655
You do your own thing. And my life was exciting and 
full. At about that time, the toughest decision

23:40.701 --> 23:49.249
was to decide which invited lecture to accept and 
which trip to go on. And the biggest challenge was

23:50.330 --> 23:59.758
keeping the contractual dollars flowing into a 
growing research institute.

24:00.616 --> 24:15.333
But I had been asked the year before by Fred Benson 
again to take the presidency of the Texas A&M

24:00.616 --> 24:15.333
Research Foundation. And I had turned that down. I 
had not been interested in

24:17.716 --> 24:24.624
that. Why did he ask you? Was that when he was? Yeah, 
he was. When did he become the head of that? He had

24:30.333 --> 24:31.474
been. He started it, didn't he? Yeah, he started 
it. He started it while he was director of the

24:34.396 --> 24:37.539
Engineering Experiment Station. Oh, I didn't 
realize it. And then he was kind of... He wore both

24:41.562 --> 24:42.763
hats. Oh, absolutely. And Fred was also,

24:45.986 --> 24:57.596
if not the chairman of the board of the Research 
Foundation, was kind of the godfather of guiding

24:45.986 --> 24:57.596
it. And I don't know what influence he had, but I 
know when I was asked to take it, it wasn't, would

25:00.607 --> 25:07.117
you consider being a candidate? I mean, she just 
walked in my office and said, we'd like to make you

25:07.137 --> 25:12.825
president of the foundation, and I'd like for you 
to think about it. And I did, and told him I wasn't

25:13.727 --> 25:16.992
interested. So I turned that down the year before, 
and then he came in and called me down. It was off,

25:21.438 --> 25:25.264
and he said, okay, Porter, we want to make you 
director of the Texas Indian Experimental

25:21.438 --> 25:25.264
Station. And my first reaction was, well, I'm not 
interested in that. I mean, I'm doing what I want to

25:31.823 --> 25:37.550
do, and I've kind of hit a stride here. It's getting 
easier to do what I want to do, and it's expanding,

25:37.650 --> 25:44.518
and we really are building and growing in 
reputation worldwide.

25:46.941 --> 25:49.725
But he was persistent, and I thought, all right, I 
need to think about this. And I was leaving for

25:49.825 --> 25:52.348
China. I had been invited with nine other double 
E's from kind of all over the country to go on an

25:53.206 --> 25:59.534
early mission. This was September of 79. And we 
were going to be gone a month, traveling all over

26:01.857 --> 26:09.888
the PRC. And

26:09.908 --> 26:21.643
Benson told me I had to give him my decision before I 
left. He hadn't had the decision by the beginning

26:22.973 --> 26:32.404
of the academic year, and this was about 
mid-August when he called me in, so I had a couple

26:22.973 --> 26:32.404
weeks to think about it. And a guy named Bob Page had 
just been brought in as dean of engineering, and

26:32.424 --> 26:52.187
I had no idea this was a request by Fred, and I asked 
him, and Jarvis Miller was president of the

26:32.424 --> 26:52.187
university, and Frank Hubert was in as 
chancellor. Well, that wasn't interim period. So

26:59.906 --> 27:01.528
I went over to see Jarvis. Well, first thing I did 
was ask Fred who else he had talked to, and he said

27:01.628 --> 27:10.658
nobody, that he wanted to know how I felt about it. I 
said, well, I'll think about it, but I guess I feel

27:10.678 --> 27:22.512
like we need to find out how Jarvis, well, 
particularly Jarvis and Bob Page. And so Fred just

27:23.656 --> 27:28.200
called Bob Bates down to his office. Fred was then 
deputy chancellor for engineering. We went

27:34.467 --> 27:37.830
through a lot of different structures during this 
time trying to figure out how to run the place.

27:40.613 --> 27:45.257
Bob and I went to lunch following that, and I told 
him, I said, look, you're the new dean here.

27:49.221 --> 27:50.322
This is it. before I even want to consider this 
appointment, I'd like for this to be something

27:50.504 --> 28:02.038
that you feel like makes sense, and you don't know 
me from Adam, why don't you go check me out, and

27:50.504 --> 28:02.038
after you've had some time to do that, give me a 
call. And he called back in, I think it was the next

28:02.058 --> 28:08.686
day, or probably maybe two days at most, but I 
believe it was the next day, and said, you know,

28:02.058 --> 28:08.686
let's do this. If you're willing to do it, let's do 
it. So I got another stop or two to make, so then I

28:11.709 --> 28:14.713
went over to see Jarvis.

28:18.517 --> 28:18.958
Jarvis. felt the same way. He knew what it was all 
about. Oh yeah, he'd been director of takes.

28:33.811 --> 28:48.152
But between, and I'm not going to go into all that in 
this, it's probably ought to be written down

28:33.811 --> 28:48.152
somewhere and sealed, but between that moment and 
the actual transition to where I took the

28:48.385 --> 28:56.213
directorship was a pretty interesting time.

28:58.134 --> 29:08.705
Actually, I guess at that moment, Frank Hubert was 
not, at that specific moment, Frank Hubert had not

28:58.134 --> 29:08.705
been asked to come in as interim chancellor. It was 
just in advance of that. Because I went off to

29:10.967 --> 29:16.232
China, having agreed that I would accept the 
directorship. which Fred promptly announced to

29:16.904 --> 29:22.929
the entire faculty while I was gone. And so when I 
returned to campus, I was greeted by my colleagues

29:22.969 --> 29:33.119
with great response to this announcement. And 
then the system went apart. The university at the

29:37.723 --> 29:44.869
moment, at that moment when I agreed to do that, the 
agencies reported to the university president,

29:45.068 --> 29:52.617
which Jarvis had gotten the board to agree to 
change from reporting to the system. And when

29:54.019 --> 30:07.895
Jarvis finally was in, when Jarvis finally 
transitioned out of the presidency,

29:54.019 --> 30:07.895
the system was reorganized. Hubert was 
chancellor And the system went back to the mode in

30:09.790 --> 30:27.242
which it had been, where then all of the agencies 
were autonomously managed along with the

30:09.790 --> 30:27.242
universities in the system, and did not report to 
the board through the president, but through the

30:09.790 --> 30:27.242
chancellor. And so I went through a little 
interesting period of meeting Frank and

30:27.262 --> 30:33.233
discussing all of this.

30:35.963 --> 30:42.269
And finally it got out to the point where I told all 
of them I wasn't interested in the job.

30:43.450 --> 30:46.893
But the bottom line was it finally did happen in 
March.

30:49.516 --> 30:59.946
And so from 1980 through for the five years from 
1980 through 1984, I was director of the Texas

30:49.516 --> 30:59.946
Indian Experiment Station. If you had a 
philosophy as director of the Experiment

30:59.966 --> 31:03.169
Station, I was

31:03.892 --> 31:13.003
interested. I went back and read the original 
legislation of 1914 that created the Texas

31:13.123 --> 31:21.493
Engineering Experiment Station. And the 
comments from previous directors, the first one

31:23.336 --> 31:29.443
was a guy named Spence, as I recall. And in point of 
fact, the Texas Engineering Experimental

31:31.398 --> 31:46.063
Station had never really functioned as a state 
agency like the Texas... Well, it functioned as if

31:31.398 --> 31:46.063
it was, but it was not. It was a state agency created 
by an act of the legislature, and the director had

31:51.327 --> 31:57.415
fiduciary responsibility for taxpayers' money 
and got the money directly from the legislature,

31:51.327 --> 31:57.415
just like that. But they didn't get much money, as I 
recall. No, they didn't. But we changed that. We

32:00.980 --> 32:06.507
turned that around, which was one of my objectives 
and one of my challenges. And what I was asked by the

32:06.607 --> 32:18.803
Board of Regents to do was to turn TEAS into a true 
state agency and to branch it out statewide and to

32:06.607 --> 32:18.803
have it work for Texas all the way across the state, 
like the Agricultural Experiment Station. And to

32:24.135 --> 32:31.207
make it something different than a research 
instrument of the College of Engineering of Texas

32:24.135 --> 32:31.207
A&M University only. And as a faculty member of 
Texas A&M, a

32:33.511 --> 32:46.191
professor of electrical engineering, I walked 
down to the Texas Engineering Experiment Station

32:33.511 --> 32:46.191
office And the dean of the College of Engineering 
of Texas A&M University was also the director of

32:46.880 --> 32:55.750
the Texas Engineering Experiment Station, so you 
couldn't tell the difference. And the resources

32:57.913 --> 33:12.550
of the Texas Engineering Experiment Station were 
predominantly used, if not totally used, by a

32:57.913 --> 33:12.550
faculty of Texas A&M University in the College of 
Engineering.

33:15.010 --> 33:19.776
So that was my tradition, my expectation, my 
experience. When in September, after talking to

33:21.798 --> 33:27.866
Paige and Miller, I agreed to take the job. When in 
March, I was put into the position, I was then

33:28.306 --> 33:41.983
reporting to the board through the chancellor. 
And the board and the chancellor said, Porter,

33:45.993 --> 33:50.099
turn this into a bona fide state agency that can 
serve the state. And as that began to happen, and it

33:51.922 --> 33:57.671
did, we did it. It created some serious 
consternation on the campus of Texas A&M. But we

34:06.746 --> 34:12.034
opened divisions of the Engineering Experiment 
Station at UT Arlington. at Lamar University, at

34:12.757 --> 34:24.111
Prairie View A&M University, at the specific 
request of von Breit to try to help that

34:12.757 --> 34:24.111
institution gain some breadth. And at the time I 
left, I was in very substantive discussion with

34:26.113 --> 34:40.671
Peter Flon and Jerry Fonkin. about the 
possibility of T's operating the balconies in

34:41.022 --> 34:55.358
Austin, which would have been a UT-Austin-Texas 
A&M connection that I think would have been

34:41.022 --> 34:55.358
extremely healthy for the state.

34:57.921 --> 35:10.455
But back at the ranch, meantime, I had also 
established the education technology division

34:57.921 --> 35:10.455
to help the College of Education at Texas A&M 
University to develop a research program. I had to

35:14.592 --> 35:22.162
establish the business technology division to do 
the same thing with the college business. Bill

35:22.182 --> 35:26.727
Muse and then Bill Mobley headed those two 
divisions up. And we went from zero funded dollars

35:26.748 --> 35:33.456
in the college of business to a million dollars 
pretty quickly. So TEAS was beginning to branch

35:34.820 --> 35:40.967
out, as I had been asked to make it do. And our state 
revenue went from what had been $1 million a year to

35:42.248 --> 35:47.915
$6 million a year from the state. And we were 
turning that in leveraging outside contract

35:48.275 --> 35:58.887
dollars into a total operational budget in excess 
of $30 million.

36:02.931 --> 36:03.612
I learned a lot. about the politics of Texas, about 
the politics of higher education, about the

36:04.283 --> 36:11.811
politics of Texas A&M, and state agencies. What 
about private business cooperation? Was there

36:17.136 --> 36:18.878
much of that kind of activity? Yes, and that was one 
of the real leverages of TEAS for particularly

36:18.898 --> 36:31.371
Texas A&M, was it was a place, because it was a 
separate agency, it wasn't a line item in the

36:31.756 --> 36:33.338
university budget. It was its own budget. And it 
had some leveraged advantages for the university

36:35.902 --> 36:44.375
that a lot of the colleges were seeing how to take 
advantage of. One of the problems has been

36:44.416 --> 36:51.186
historically, and always will be historically, 
the issue is one of control. It's who's running the

36:52.608 --> 36:57.235
place, the system or the university or the agency. 
Sure. And it always will. And it's why chancellors

37:00.089 --> 37:03.093
and presidents have a hard time getting along. And 
unless chancellors, in my judgment, can rise to

37:03.594 --> 37:25.303
the level of kind of statesmen, national and 
international statesmanship, to speak to the

37:03.594 --> 37:25.303
larger issue philosophically of the needs of 
higher education and can pontificate those

37:03.594 --> 37:25.303
points at the national and international level 
representing a state and a system within the

37:25.790 --> 37:38.183
state's views rather than worrying about which 
classes are being taught on campus and leave that

37:25.790 --> 37:38.183
to the administrative operation and the 
president of that campus and rise up to another

37:25.790 --> 37:38.183
level. The greatest conflict occurs within our 
educational systems when everybody wants to be

37:40.445 --> 37:51.477
sure they're in charge of the football coach or the 
curriculum.

37:52.874 --> 38:10.078
But in the case, as I see it still today, and as I saw 
it then, in the case of the Engineering Experiment

37:52.874 --> 38:10.078
Station, we had the advantage of being able to 
focus on research and move aggressively. As an

38:11.400 --> 38:16.166
institution, we were not encumbered with 
teaching responsibilities. And we had the

38:17.508 --> 38:19.771
resources. We got the money. from the legislature 
directly and had full authority independent of

38:22.912 --> 38:30.853
any other entity on what to do with those 
resources. Including the board of A&M? Oh, no. The

38:34.182 --> 38:35.446
board approved the budget. Right. But the board 
was given legislative authority So once the board

38:39.652 --> 38:57.270
approved your budget,

38:39.652 --> 38:57.270
that was before the fact because you didn't go to 
the legislature to argue your budget until the

38:39.652 --> 38:57.270
board had reviewed what you asked for or what you 
were planning to ask for. So by the time the session

38:58.171 --> 39:05.338
was over and the money was appropriated, the 
authority was already there. And in the case of the

39:06.145 --> 39:22.865
state agencies, particularly the ag experience 
station and the engineering experience station,

39:06.145 --> 39:22.865
it had some unusual advantages, maybe unique 
advantages, because it got to keep all its own

39:06.145 --> 39:22.865
indirect costs.

39:24.387 --> 39:33.638
Because in essence, we were the, let me rephrase 
that, the university was the reluctant landlord

39:24.387 --> 39:33.638
of the agencies. Because where that coupling 
occurred was the facilities and the buildings in

39:34.681 --> 39:45.934
which these agencies operated were budgeted. The 
facilities were budgeted through the

39:46.935 --> 39:49.318
university. And if you put yourself in the 
position of the president of the university or,

39:51.080 --> 40:00.891
say, the vice president for research,

40:03.385 --> 40:12.839
They didn't have near the authority or the power, 
that is the resources, the dollars, to build a

40:03.385 --> 40:12.839
research program that those two agencies did. And 
so from their perspective, the tail was wagging

40:14.181 --> 40:18.187
the dog. And it's an understandable one. Yet when 
you put yourself in the position of the director of

40:21.512 --> 40:26.539
the agency, that's his job. That's right. And you 
may, well, yeah, and your boss is the same boss as

40:28.428 --> 40:34.659
the president of the university. And when the 
entire board of regents stands in unison and

40:35.060 --> 40:49.005
applauds what you're doing, and the other guy is 
getting his, and he's saying, hmm, I don't think I

40:35.060 --> 40:49.005
like this a whole lot, and it can create and did and 
still does and always will. I don't think it's a

40:49.045 --> 40:50.447
matter of personality. It's a matter of drawing 
the lines on the diagram. We, I think, waded

40:54.095 --> 41:06.028
through a lot of the awkwardness of that

40:54.095 --> 41:06.028
fairly well, just working through personal 
relationships. But it was such a tumultuous

41:07.089 --> 41:10.493
period within the A&M system. The whole world, 
yeah. The turmoil, yeah. I really grew quite bored

41:13.096 --> 41:14.338
with it. And then the chancellor changed. Art 
Hanson came in. then the dean changed. It was, and

41:26.987 --> 41:42.482
this was part of the period when A&M, in my 
judgment, was trying to create a different kind of

41:26.987 --> 41:42.482
scholarly image for itself, which I didn't 
particularly, well, I didn't like and still

41:26.987 --> 41:42.482
don't. I think it was a big time mistake. But, so be 
it. That's life. So, that's The 80 to 85 period, you

41:54.203 --> 41:58.929
asked the question about industry. We worked 
closely with like the Ford Motor Company. I

42:02.534 --> 42:04.537
remember one interesting call I got. You may 
remember the period when Ford had the problem with

42:05.058 --> 42:12.147
their automatic transmissions jumping out of 
reverse. Yeah. I got a call from the vice president

42:15.492 --> 42:21.460
of research at Ford, and he wanted to know if we 
could do an analysis on the hydraulic

42:23.617 --> 42:29.965
transmission. And I immediately knew why he was 
calling. I said, sure, we could. I said, does this

42:33.290 --> 42:37.355
have to do with your transmission jumping out of 
reverse? Well, yes, as a matter of fact, it does.

42:38.817 --> 42:44.104
And we've got a testimony before the Senate 
hearing in 30 days. And we'd like to have an

42:44.665 --> 42:48.871
independent assessment. And I thought, oh, boy, 
that could really be a political hot potato. But we

42:52.895 --> 42:55.338
had the talent that could evaluate. And the more I 
thought about that, I decided this was the

42:55.739 --> 43:01.366
occasion where we needed to do a public service. So 
I told him. I said, yeah, we'll do it under two

43:02.007 --> 43:04.310
conditions. The first one is obvious, but I just 
stated that we'll tell you whatever we find. And

43:08.756 --> 43:10.539
the second is we'll accept no payment.

43:13.222 --> 43:14.023
What did he say then?

43:16.947 --> 43:17.708
Well, he agreed to it. We did it. And I don't recall 
what the results were. But I wanted to be sure he

43:22.325 --> 43:29.956
fully understood that our opinion wasn't for 
sale. And B, furthermore, that I didn't want to

43:30.056 --> 43:40.751
subject Texas A&M to even the scrutiny that we had 
sold an opinion, regardless of what it was, so that

43:30.056 --> 43:40.751
we'd do this as a public service for free. You have 
to. I'm glad you thought of that. Well, but then we

43:44.566 --> 43:46.672
did a lot of work for them. And we did work for TI. We 
did work for Boeing. We did work for Shell. We did

43:49.940 --> 43:54.091
work for, I mean, I'm just grabbing names now, a 
cross section of industries. And that was the

43:55.735 --> 43:58.322
engineering, that was the concept of the 
legislature, which isn't a one-to-one analogy

43:59.028 --> 44:04.176
with the agricultural industry. The agrarian 
society was very different and continues to be.

44:08.342 --> 44:16.133
Parity doesn't exist in the automotive or the 
electronics industry like it does in the corn

44:08.342 --> 44:16.133
industry or the cotton or cattle. Competitive. 
Yeah. But let me mention one other thing that may be

44:19.719 --> 44:23.825
relevant to the Hark story. Of course, I 
personally had come out of industry. Yeah, you

44:29.200 --> 44:31.364
know, I was thinking about everything you've been 
telling me. Had you not had that several years'

44:31.464 --> 44:37.896
experience at TI, I think your perspective of the 
world and your knowledge of the world may have been

44:31.464 --> 44:37.896
substantially different. Oh, very 
substantially different, no question about it.

44:39.819 --> 44:46.331
And my continuing work in relationship with 
electroscientific industries was a very

44:39.819 --> 44:46.331
educational period for me. In having home base in 
the academic community in America, but taking

44:53.281 --> 45:08.479
full advantage of the academic policy of giving 
your professors one day a week to go off and do

44:53.281 --> 45:08.479
consulting and maintaining my ties back to 
corporate America and my involvement. At this

45:10.321 --> 45:18.090
point in time, the 80 to 85 period, I went on the 
board of directors of electroscientific

45:10.321 --> 45:18.090
industries. I began to function not only as a 
consultant, but as a director of a corporation, a

45:19.403 --> 45:26.652
high-tech corp in this country. So the first time 
you're really getting a broad profile of

45:26.832 --> 45:30.136
industry. Yeah, and I'm beginning to gain an 
understanding. We took this company from a

45:32.278 --> 45:36.143
privately, very closely held company. We took it 
public.

45:41.689 --> 45:48.077
So I got the full-blown experience as a board 
member of going through a... an initial public

45:48.631 --> 46:02.924
offering of a privately held company, a good bath 
in the Securities and Exchange Commission

45:48.631 --> 46:02.924
regulation and all of the aspects of what that 
involves. So I'm gaining during this period an

46:02.944 --> 46:11.912
awful lot of experience in business as well as 
academic, as well as state politics. In 1980, when

46:12.753 --> 46:16.596
I took over the directorship of the experiment 
station, Well, I was a greenhorn professor with a

46:17.133 --> 46:31.355
little bit of industry experience and having 
demonstrated an ability to pull together an

46:17.133 --> 46:31.355
institute with a group of faculty and begin to 
attract federal R&D dollars. But I had never

46:31.415 --> 46:37.905
walked on the floor of the House or the Senate and 
argued before a committee a budget for a state

46:31.415 --> 46:37.905
agency, which is what I had to do. And it was a budget 
I had not put together. It was a budget that Fred had

46:40.028 --> 46:41.530
put together. But they just handed me the budget 
and said, Here's when the legislature meets. This

46:47.755 --> 46:48.957
is when your session is. Good luck, son. So it was a 
great experience. So I began to learn the

46:53.704 --> 47:11.811
political process, the budgeting process, how to 
deal with the legislature,

46:53.704 --> 47:11.811
how a budget for a state budget was put together, 
how a university or a system budget was put

46:53.704 --> 47:11.811
together.
