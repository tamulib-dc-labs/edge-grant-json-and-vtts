WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:05.272
we're not treated any differently than anyone else.

00:06.053 --> 00:07.294
You're treating us differently.

00:08.395 --> 00:15.442
You're pointing out that we're different, that we're of a different race, of a different, you know, and we really don't like it.

00:15.903 --> 00:19.066
And she said, this was a girl named Jennifer Sims.

00:19.826 --> 00:25.752
She started A&M in 16 and she'd already been to Blint a year.

00:26.833 --> 00:31.978
She finished up with a double major in philosophy and architecture and is now in law school, I think at Vanderbilt.

00:31.958 --> 00:34.381
But she said, I'll tell you what I'll do.

00:34.841 --> 00:40.027
I'll take over the student presidency of the peer advising group, but we'll make it for everybody.

00:40.728 --> 00:44.713
It'll be all new incoming freshmen and all transfer students.

00:45.113 --> 00:49.879
And you can't differentiate as to race, which is what we've done since then.

00:50.820 --> 00:53.663
And that was probably two years before Hopwood.

00:54.385 --> 01:03.905
Why has architecture, and this campus in general, been so nearly totally free of racial incidents?

01:06.731 --> 01:07.853
I think it's because you're an Aggie.

01:09.978 --> 01:11.922
I think that's the answer.

01:11.902 --> 01:17.171
And we've never had a race problem over in architecture because they're in those labs together all the time.

01:17.793 --> 01:28.712
They get to know each other really well and I think they would feel insulted, you know, if anybody tried to be prejudiced over in architecture, they'd tear them to pieces.

01:28.692 --> 01:31.936
And I presume you had plenty of Asian students.

01:31.976 --> 01:32.296
Oh, yeah.

01:32.476 --> 01:33.377
That's no problem either.

01:34.038 --> 01:39.484
They've been some of our very best students.

01:40.045 --> 01:47.794
As the program was growing in quality, did the College of Architecture attempt to recruit incoming students?

01:49.056 --> 01:49.196
Yeah.

01:49.216 --> 01:50.898
Did they all go to high schools and so forth?

01:51.038 --> 01:51.298
Yeah.

01:51.959 --> 01:54.141
I was generally responsible for that.

01:54.161 --> 01:56.404
How did you describe that effort?

01:56.806 --> 02:04.183
It was kind of a lost cause because you would go to the high schools and you would go to the architectural areas.

02:04.568 --> 02:10.396
Well, it turned out the architectural drafting or things like that were the kids that couldn't make it in academics.

02:11.377 --> 02:16.423
So I might spend six periods talking to students and find three students that could even go to college.

02:17.645 --> 02:27.538
And I just had a talk with Keith Sylvester at noon today who's a black PhD student, a faculty member, that wants to take over the summer program.

02:27.518 --> 02:44.077
our career horizons thing, and he was talking about doing the same with the high schools, and I said, you know, you're probably, it's a lost cause, in that the students we're trying to attract now are that are actually going to get admitted to A&M.

02:44.578 --> 02:46.422
You probably aren't going to find any of them.

02:46.570 --> 02:48.253
in any of the architecture classes.

02:48.753 --> 03:01.352
You might find them in the honors class, but how often is it going to be for one single person in a college to be able to go to an honors group at a high school and say, I'm representing a particular college, not the whole university.

03:01.893 --> 03:06.300
So you're probably going to step on admission toes and things like that.

03:08.407 --> 03:21.040
I don't think the diversity thing is going to be, I guess the only thing you can do is if they apply to the university, then you try to write them like heck, you know, if you find out that they are a minority and try to get them that way.

03:23.543 --> 03:37.637
What image did you, have you and others found that A&M's, in general, but A&M's architecture program has in regional, in the high schools in this region?

03:37.921 --> 03:58.676
For some funny reason, Consolidated, I don't know who's teaching them there or guiding them, but they seem to go elsewhere, which is really funny because the other programs are so straight architecture, they have no ability to go in any other direction but just straight architecture.

03:59.778 --> 04:02.983
And they seem to be getting some guidance from the high school.

04:02.963 --> 04:07.573
Not from Bryan, but from Consolidate, which I thought was kind of interesting.

04:08.014 --> 04:16.973
I remember when Susan Sackett was trying to go to, I think it was Michigan or Michigan State, and

04:18.455 --> 04:28.229
A guy at Michigan had known Bill Sackett and had phoned him and said, did you know what your high school counselor wrote about Susan Sackett?

04:28.770 --> 04:30.873
Not Susan Sackett, that's Karen Sackett.

04:30.893 --> 04:33.337
And he said, no, what do you mean?

04:33.357 --> 04:37.283
He said, well, they wrote that, no, she hadn't done any leadership stuff.

04:37.303 --> 04:39.105
She was like president of the student council.

04:39.145 --> 04:40.327
She was chair leader.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.489
She was all this other stuff.

04:41.870 --> 04:45.114
But they said, you know, you really just need to go to A&M.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.977
That's where you need to go.

04:46.957 --> 04:51.666
You know, so a lot of those counselors there wield a lot of power.

04:51.686 --> 04:55.294
And depending on what their thoughts are, I think.

04:55.474 --> 04:57.899
Now when I said region, I was meaning this region of the United States.

04:58.099 --> 04:59.242
Oh, this region of the United States.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.304
What is the image of?

05:01.526 --> 05:03.430
We're known pretty much all over.

05:03.410 --> 05:11.304
Like we've had to cap our enrollment, which you probably know, engineering business and architecture, and we're probably already full for next fall.

05:12.185 --> 05:18.236
Even though applications aren't due until February the 15th, I imagine we have totally reached our quota at this point in time.

05:18.977 --> 05:25.789
And we've had people from San Diego, from Chicago, from all over, especially for the VIS program,

05:25.769 --> 05:36.823
And hopefully in the next two years we'll have a VES curriculum that will be the first undergraduate electronic arts program going, you know, if the dean has his say.

05:38.045 --> 05:52.063
As you and your colleagues think about the programs here in architecture, with what other institutions in this part of the United States do you think are the primary competitors?

05:53.258 --> 05:57.525
It's almost like apples and oranges.

05:59.709 --> 06:11.589
The closest example is like if you were to go in the Galleria and you were to walk through Neiman's and then you walked outside and then you went into an Ann Taylor boutique.

06:11.729 --> 06:18.000
Rice would be like an Ann Taylor's boutique, so would University of Texas, so would Arlington.

06:17.980 --> 06:21.447
Tech's just not quite there yet.

06:23.211 --> 06:28.823
They're trying to be a little more well-rounded, but it's like it's two different stores.

06:29.785 --> 06:34.154
Whereas we have all of the stuff in the Neiman's that Ann Taylor has, but we have so much more.

06:36.098 --> 06:37.862
There's no other school that has

06:37.842 --> 06:38.863
You know, the planning.

06:39.303 --> 06:42.927
And landscape you can barely get at Arlington.

06:43.448 --> 06:45.290
At Tech it's in agriculture.

06:46.391 --> 06:48.853
And it's more of a, if you want to go for wool's nursery.

06:49.694 --> 06:51.816
So nationally?

06:51.856 --> 06:59.644
Nationally I would say Berkeley, North Carolina State, Arizona State, Florida.

06:59.664 --> 07:01.106
Those would be the closest schools.

07:01.746 --> 07:05.470
Would we be in the top 20?

07:05.450 --> 07:07.195
Oh, yeah.

07:07.215 --> 07:11.766
If you would look at what we had to offer, you know, it would be in the top, you know, two or three.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.290
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

07:13.431 --> 07:21.231
If you would look at it as an architecture boutique, which is what 98% of all the schools of architecture are boutiques.

07:21.211 --> 07:27.221
And if they say, is this a pure design school, you know, they would not rate A&M as a pure design school because we're not.

07:28.022 --> 07:31.407
And as far as research, we're always one, two, or three.

07:32.449 --> 07:35.373
And 98% of them have no research.

07:35.774 --> 07:42.004
The closest school in the state of Texas is UT, and they're 23rd in research in the U.S.

07:41.984 --> 07:51.020
All right, now for Rodney Hill, trace your growth, progress, and some big steps in the 80s and 90s.

07:51.621 --> 07:57.732
What were your tasks and your greatest accomplishments?

07:57.712 --> 08:03.044
that I developed in the 80s was more on the creativity line of how to get students more in tune to their creativity.

08:04.086 --> 08:08.897
And then when McCarthy came, I'd never thought of publishing at all.

08:08.957 --> 08:11.943
I mean, I always thought my artwork was publishing, which he allowed.

08:12.946 --> 08:15.872
But he also wanted you to talk about it.

08:15.852 --> 08:24.585
So when he first got here, I had to do a talk at, it was the Beginning Design Conference and it was held in Albuquerque.

08:25.526 --> 08:29.212
And Stasel was there and John Ferry was there and we all had our papers accepted.

08:29.733 --> 08:35.962
So I was going in through some of the stuff that I do in my design class which was completely different from the rest of the nation.

08:36.523 --> 08:40.088
And they were like...

08:40.068 --> 08:46.019
One of my friends at another university said, well, if you're going to say some of these things, you have to have statistics to back it up.

08:47.141 --> 08:57.399
And so I went through the last, I guess it was six years of my freshman class and then started logging them.

08:58.361 --> 09:04.692
And there were like 15 sections and I had three.

09:04.672 --> 09:09.739
It turned out that 90% of all the scholarships were people that had been in my class.

09:09.759 --> 09:17.991
90% of all the people that won outstanding freshman, junior, sophomore or senior had been in my class.

09:18.952 --> 09:26.983
And then all the people that won the high grades or outstanding talent, I think the lowest I ever had was 85%.

09:26.963 --> 09:33.252
And so that was one of the reasons when Windler took over.

09:35.536 --> 09:41.765
Some of the faculty said it's unfair for Rodney to do that with three sections.

09:42.686 --> 09:48.835
You know, you need to develop a course so, and I don't mean to be bragging, but you can ask Walter.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.342
So he established what was called a freshman theory class.

09:53.662 --> 09:56.346
So I get every single freshman in my class.

09:56.326 --> 10:00.793
And I go over creativity, problem solving, future studies, and environmental psychology with them.

10:01.794 --> 10:07.423
And so, and it also seems to kind of, it changes their attitude.

10:08.725 --> 10:12.651
It gears them to be real positive about learning.

10:14.173 --> 10:19.581
Students that come out of the class are really gung-ho to continue on and do the next step.

10:20.242 --> 10:21.043
They're not burned out.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.046
They see, you know, light within themselves.

10:23.827 --> 10:25.590
So that's probably

10:26.988 --> 10:30.213
I would say my biggest claim to fame.

10:30.313 --> 10:34.419
All right, but you were teaching and still teaching all this time, first or second year.

10:34.760 --> 10:34.940
Yeah.

10:36.222 --> 10:36.342
Right.

10:36.362 --> 10:39.527
But then you became… Associate Dean.

10:39.948 --> 10:40.929
Yeah.

10:40.949 --> 10:41.671
When did that happen?

10:42.552 --> 10:45.056
About 88, 89, right in there.

10:45.817 --> 10:49.823
And that was with McCarthy because McCarthy was having so much problem with the students.

10:50.056 --> 10:54.961
And they were, you know, rioting against him and wanting to tear down everything.

10:54.981 --> 11:02.568
And so he was advised to get an associate dean that the students could identify with and trusted to calm them down.

11:03.349 --> 11:06.773
And so that's when he asked me to come in as associate dean.

11:06.893 --> 11:08.394
So you've been doing that since then?

11:08.514 --> 11:08.714
Right.

11:08.995 --> 11:09.255
All right.

11:09.275 --> 11:13.940
Describe a typical work day for you now.

11:15.161 --> 11:19.405
It begins about when and it includes this, this, this, and it ends about what?

11:19.385 --> 11:29.539
Well, it starts about 8 in the morning and ends 6.30 to 7 at night, depending on a faculty sponsor for AIAS and for other groups around campus.

11:29.559 --> 11:32.423
So if they have night meetings, then I have to go to those.

11:35.407 --> 11:39.773
But I'll start in and up till this year.

11:39.753 --> 11:45.541
the undergraduate programs office and all the advisors were in there with me, you know, in various offices.

11:45.621 --> 11:57.458
So my management style, which is almost a no management style, is like I'll do anything that I ask my advisors to do.

11:57.438 --> 12:04.407
If one of them is sick and there's a line of students out the door, I'll sit at her desk and counsel students until the cows come home.

12:05.128 --> 12:09.173
And we always were trying to help students.

12:09.914 --> 12:12.578
If they would come in, they had a problem, we would solve it.

12:13.178 --> 12:14.760
And we're super student friendly.

12:16.983 --> 12:18.746
Students knew they could come down for our help.

12:19.446 --> 12:22.230
They divided it up this year.

12:23.324 --> 12:32.896
More what I've been doing this year is chairing committees, like chairing this curriculum for visual studies and things like that that somebody's got to do.

12:33.216 --> 12:41.707
I don't particularly enjoy doing it, you know, but I mean, I always, he didn't want me, he wanted me to stop teaching to take this job and I said no.

12:42.368 --> 12:43.750
So that's my lifeblood.

12:43.970 --> 12:46.333
So you've been teaching how many courses?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.337
Well, one course, about 160 to 170 people.

12:50.278 --> 12:50.378
Okay.

12:50.358 --> 12:54.122
And all right, back to the workday.

12:54.643 --> 12:59.349
So that about how much of your workday is in that office doing paperwork?

12:59.429 --> 13:04.755
Now, this year, it's the majority of my work is doing paperwork.

13:05.596 --> 13:09.801
And then I do most of my class development stuff at home at night.

13:10.462 --> 13:13.425
You know, read the books I need to read to make up new lectures.

13:13.866 --> 13:16.028
When do you do your creative work?

13:16.048 --> 13:17.530
Usually on weekends.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.753
which has gotten to be a problem.

13:21.234 --> 13:27.883
I'm thinking of just going to teaching and letting somebody else administer for a while.

13:29.145 --> 13:36.295
Other personal accomplishments during those 25-30 years that you haven't mentioned so far.

13:39.177 --> 13:41.339
Well, I enjoyed getting Parents of the Year.

13:42.581 --> 13:43.802
One year, I was first faculty member.

13:44.183 --> 13:44.563
Oh, really?

13:44.763 --> 13:46.885
Yeah, 93 and 94.

13:47.406 --> 13:48.828
How did you learn that you were?

13:49.969 --> 13:54.234
Well, our daughter was supposedly going to get a Shewitz Award.

13:55.315 --> 14:00.040
And so we went that Sunday to see her get the award.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.583
And instead, our names were announced.

14:02.643 --> 14:04.385
So it was a surprise.

14:04.585 --> 14:05.226
Yeah.

14:05.246 --> 14:05.626
How good.

14:05.806 --> 14:06.247
How good.

14:06.287 --> 14:07.328
So that was fun.

14:07.308 --> 14:17.701
And then for two years, actually I think it happened the same year, I got the Ed Guthrie Award and then I got the... What's the Guthrie Award?

14:17.721 --> 14:22.367
It's an advising award by the University Council of Advisors.

14:22.987 --> 14:30.717
And then a month later I got the faculty, the former students, Student Relationship Award.

14:30.697 --> 14:34.401
Shewitz was a close friend of ours.

14:34.461 --> 14:34.801
Oh, really?

14:34.841 --> 14:36.163
And I really, really like him.

14:36.463 --> 14:37.604
What is the Shewitz Award?

14:38.365 --> 14:39.907
Spirit Award.

14:39.947 --> 14:40.287
Oh, no.

14:41.308 --> 14:42.109
Are you saying WIRUS?

14:42.730 --> 14:43.631
Oh, maybe it was the WIRUS Award.

14:43.651 --> 14:44.011
I'm sorry.

14:44.031 --> 14:46.013
I thought it was the Shewitz Award.

14:46.634 --> 14:46.974
You're right.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.679
WIRUS, W-E-I-R-U-S.

14:52.280 --> 14:52.800
All right.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.523
And then what year did you?

14:55.503 --> 15:06.609
Let's see, this one was 85 for this, and then 90, I think it's 92, I got the one for student relations.

15:06.710 --> 15:08.715
So you have one for teaching and one for student relations.

15:08.735 --> 15:13.967
Right, and then the Ed Guthrie, then I got the college level one, and then I have the student senate one.

15:15.652 --> 15:17.994
Can I hit the John one quick?

15:18.915 --> 15:26.783
In the mid-70s when school board elections and they had always been controlled by the ag mafia and the local bankers.

15:27.944 --> 15:38.615
And so we were trying to get some gifted and talented programs within the college and the College Station School District and we were being met with all sorts of opposition.

15:39.335 --> 15:43.920
So we ran Joe Natowitz and Bruce Robeck.

15:44.103 --> 15:48.211
Anyhow, it was fairly, you know, terrible name calling, you know, from the other side.

15:49.234 --> 15:51.097
And we were all politically naive.

15:53.743 --> 15:55.186
But we were all trying really, really hard.

15:55.426 --> 15:56.949
I'm thinking of this in light of Florida.

15:58.072 --> 16:01.379
So we knew it was going to be really, really close.

16:02.060 --> 16:03.563
So...

16:03.543 --> 16:16.480
On the day of the election, I went in to the architecture building, and there were a bunch of students there, and a lot of them had their voting thing here, and of course none of them would even think about going to vote for school board.

16:16.981 --> 16:25.652
And I had a case of beer in the back, and I said, hey, how would y'all like a beer on a quick ride to the polls?

16:26.341 --> 16:30.007
And Bruce won by, and that was by nine votes.

16:31.409 --> 16:32.451
And I had taken 12.

16:32.952 --> 16:34.715
So you may have swung.

16:34.935 --> 16:36.859
Yeah, I kept real quiet.

16:36.879 --> 16:37.460
You may have swung.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.061
About that.

16:38.842 --> 16:39.703
But when would that have been?

16:40.765 --> 16:41.366
Mid-70s.

16:43.610 --> 16:47.877
And then two years later I ran and got in then.

16:48.211 --> 16:49.133
And O.D.

16:49.153 --> 16:54.463
Butler was trying to down me in front of the college station PTO.

16:55.184 --> 16:57.469
And he didn't really do any background.

16:57.769 --> 17:02.137
But he said, why would we want anybody from California on our school board?

17:02.759 --> 17:05.123
I said, well, I'm from Lubbock.

17:05.609 --> 17:18.151
Both my parents were born in Texas, my grandparents were born in Texas, and I have Le Pen Apache from Mason County in my blood, and so I'm pretty much Texan as close as you can get.

17:18.171 --> 17:22.278
And then somebody in the back popped up and said, O.D., aren't you from Michigan?

17:25.063 --> 17:25.944
Now, you do know where O.D.

17:25.964 --> 17:26.405
is from?

17:26.425 --> 17:26.826
No.

17:26.846 --> 17:27.868
He went to high school in Orange.

17:28.068 --> 17:28.789
Oh, did he?

17:28.809 --> 17:28.910
Okay.

17:29.070 --> 17:29.170
Yeah.

17:29.588 --> 17:34.815
His brother was the long-time chairman of the Orange School District, in my memory.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.759
Old, old, old Orange status, yeah.

17:38.779 --> 17:39.080
Okay.

17:39.600 --> 17:46.809
In terms of the community, what did you and your family think about the Ann and Consolidated School District quality?

17:47.090 --> 17:48.251
Loved it.

17:48.992 --> 17:50.114
Well, we sent our kids to St.

17:50.134 --> 17:56.862
Thomas, because that's where we were going, you know, for the early school, with Mary Oxley and that group, and, you know, you couldn't have asked for anything better.

17:56.842 --> 18:04.289
And then they allowed us, which I thought was really nice, they allowed us to pick our first grade teacher, which we did.

18:04.349 --> 18:07.392
And well, St.

18:07.432 --> 18:10.174
Thomas instilled in the learning, love of learning.

18:10.775 --> 18:14.979
And then as long as we had one good teacher each year, it was fine.

18:16.020 --> 18:23.727
Did you and your wife find that your children, when they got to college, that A&M and Salt Lake had prepared them well?

18:25.445 --> 18:30.211
Both of them graduated fifth in their class, which is funny, you know, two years apart.

18:30.511 --> 18:39.263
But Bunker had placed out of all of the engineering math and started in a sophomore engineering math when he got here.

18:39.303 --> 18:50.457
And Brooke, when she was doing her master's at Thunderbird, most of them said, how did you go to a public school in Texas?

18:50.825 --> 18:52.809
and still able to, you know, function.

18:53.190 --> 18:58.281
You know, because they had just the whole idea of Texas in general as being a wasteland for public education.

18:59.023 --> 19:02.490
But Bunker did great in, you know, all of his graduate classes.

19:04.294 --> 19:07.922
He carried the golf line for College of Science when he graduated.

19:07.902 --> 19:14.271
What other, have we not mentioned already, what other special moments for you?

19:14.291 --> 19:18.237
Oh, you might want to – you know Steve Ryder, of course.

19:18.557 --> 19:19.038
Steve who?

19:19.058 --> 19:19.298
Ryder.

19:19.519 --> 19:20.300
Oh, of course.

19:20.380 --> 19:21.341
Yeah.

19:21.942 --> 19:25.086
One of his favorite stories was Benson in the early 70s.

19:26.028 --> 19:33.218
Dean Benson met with all the faculty of engineering and told them that nobody in his faculty could have facial hair.

19:33.198 --> 19:41.166
And Steve, who had never had a beard, you know, because it always grew funny with him, decided he'd better grow a beard at that point in time.

19:41.827 --> 19:52.198
And then, let's see, when, what's his name, was running for governor against white, started with a B, Briscoe.

19:52.719 --> 19:54.200
Oh, Briscoe.

19:54.280 --> 20:00.707
Steve was head of the, what, Center for Mineral and Energy Resources or something.

20:00.687 --> 20:15.827
Anyhow, that was available to either governor or either candidate, and so White had come in and gotten a whole bunch of information, and evidently during one of the debates, White just laid Briscoe flat using literature from the center.

20:16.488 --> 20:24.619
So when Briscoe got elected, it was like Steve could either resign or A&M could lose its funding for the center.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.001
So, that was kind of funny.

20:26.402 --> 20:31.349
But then, Alpha Stan Spellhouse, when he was here, his centennial, you remember him.

20:32.731 --> 20:37.517
A thing that happens with creative people is creativity is a self-involvement.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.180
It's not something you do out in public.

20:39.640 --> 20:43.406
And so, you know, the guy is obviously creative, you know, three inner patents and all sorts of things.

20:43.906 --> 20:50.295
So, but he was housed over in science and engineering, which are some of the more anal retentive areas of the campus.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.560
So, anyhow, we decided...

20:53.540 --> 20:55.303
we would have a party for him.

20:56.245 --> 21:09.207
And so about six right of us got together and we sent out invitations, and the only one you could get in was to bring an original work of art, poem, music, sculpture, and that was your entrance.

21:09.227 --> 21:15.618
So he brought in Spillhouse, a 30-second wire with a ball that rolled down, and he turned it upside down.

21:15.638 --> 21:17.742
It was really neat.

21:17.722 --> 21:38.494
When we started chatting with him, the things that you can find out when he, you know, he trusts people, we found out about his, what his creative process, the way he works is like, he does a three hours when he's in a zone state or flow state, then he does three hours above.

21:38.914 --> 21:44.623
And depending on how many ideas he's got going, he said he's been able to maintain this for up to two weeks.

21:44.603 --> 21:47.907
And so what would happen, he gets enough rest in this that he doesn't need sleep.

21:48.288 --> 21:50.991
And then he eats and puts things down in this area.

21:51.492 --> 21:58.981
But it was kind of interesting too that you couldn't have pulled this out of him had you walked up to him in an engineering class and said da-da-da-da.

21:59.401 --> 22:09.514
But then after he was here, Farley, that was the computer science head, or Farley, he called over.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.138
He said, I have all these PhD students.

22:11.498 --> 22:17.772
They can do anything I tell them to do, but they can't create anything on their own.

22:17.792 --> 22:26.811
And so, you know, can you have a 685 class and can you name about four faculty members that would team teach it?

22:26.791 --> 22:27.992
I'm trying to think.

22:28.473 --> 22:29.434
Sweeney was in on it.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.114
I was in on it.

22:30.995 --> 22:35.179
There was an English prof that taught rhetoric that was in on it, and Skip Porter.

22:37.501 --> 22:38.883
So we started trying.

22:39.684 --> 22:46.730
And for, I guess, three weeks, you know, two class periods a week, we were met with hostility.

22:46.870 --> 22:54.638
You know, people with their arms crossed, you know, 20 students in there glaring at us, listening to all this mushy, you know, butterfly stuff.

22:54.618 --> 22:59.549
So we decided to have as a surprise lecture, but we wouldn't tell him who he was.

23:00.130 --> 23:05.702
It was Jack Kelby, who just won the Nobel Prize and invented the integrated circuit handheld calculator.

23:05.722 --> 23:12.998
And so, anyhow, Jack, you know, was about 6'5", 6'6", looks like he dressed at the Bryan Mission.

23:12.978 --> 23:17.745
And he comes slumbering in to the classroom, and they're all going, oh God, now what?

23:18.787 --> 23:24.756
So he starts talking about creativity and da-da-da-da-da-da, and they're all going, oh God.

23:24.776 --> 23:28.381
So Skip saw this and thought, they really should be paying attention.

23:28.922 --> 23:31.185
So about 15 minutes until he said, stop just a minute.

23:31.926 --> 23:35.352
Okay, why don't you all tell me what field this person's from?

23:35.372 --> 23:40.960
So somebody was guessing philosophy, and somebody was guessing this and the other, and he said, do you have any idea?

23:42.205 --> 23:50.195
you know, and so they told him who he was, you know, and their jaws just dropped to the desk, you know, and they like, you know, and started taking notes.

23:50.595 --> 23:59.686
And then from that point on, the course was a complete turnaround because they finally realized that their God, you know, deals in that same way.

23:59.726 --> 24:01.609
And let's see.

24:02.850 --> 24:06.795
Oh, and Skip Porter, the next year,

24:07.737 --> 24:13.146
decided with his senior engineering class, it was one of their capstone classes, he thought he would try it with them.

24:13.988 --> 24:22.803
And so he walked in the first day of class and he passed him out sheets of paper with things that were possibilities to be invented.

24:22.843 --> 24:27.130
He said, what if we don't follow the textbook?

24:27.599 --> 24:38.473
and you pick out inventions that you want to work on, and we'll spend the whole semester trying to come up with solutions to these problems, and then we'll set you up with patents, with all these things."

24:39.014 --> 24:42.057
And there was just this sort of stunned silence across the classroom.

24:42.979 --> 24:50.308
And finally one brave person said, can we get back to you, Dr. Porter, next class period, and we'll talk amongst the class.

24:50.348 --> 24:51.109
You know, he said, sure.

24:51.545 --> 25:03.993
So the next class period, they got up, and the one person got up and said, the syllabus says you will give us three quizzes weighted equally, dot, dot, dot, and we will study, dot, dot, dot, dot, and the textbook will be so.

25:04.314 --> 25:08.102
This is the class we stand up for, and this is the class we expect to take.

25:08.082 --> 25:11.107
Which is interesting.

25:12.289 --> 25:21.423
And then let's say on things that happened in the 70s, Wayne Stark and the arts committees.

25:22.705 --> 25:30.057
Well, he started all the arts committees and so he immediately put me on as chair of the arts committee.

25:30.037 --> 25:37.786
The first time, see, we were showing, we had booked in a film series that had been shown at SMU and TCU.

25:38.807 --> 25:43.733
And the first film that was shown here, Stark heard about, I think it was Pink Flamingos or something.

25:44.113 --> 25:50.760
And so anyhow, he went in and banned the committee, you know, dissolved it, thinking, well, we'll get a new student group in.

25:51.241 --> 25:53.884
So I was in charge of it again.

25:53.864 --> 26:12.632
And then we brought in Edmund Carpenter, who is Dominic de Menil's son-in-law, who's a famous anthropologist that wrote, let's see what did he write, What a Blow That Phantom Gave Me, and there's another thing he wrote, I'll find out in a minute.

26:12.612 --> 26:28.967
He came in and did a fabulous lecture on anthropology and art, you know, nothing radical about it, but he was saying, you know, Andy Warhol's a personal friend of my wife and I, and this place is like a cookie cutter out of the 50s, and said he would love to come in.

26:29.268 --> 26:31.293
and tape some things and record.

26:31.393 --> 26:33.799
He'd do a free talk if you'd let him just tape stuff.

26:34.460 --> 26:38.229
So anyhow, we went back and told Wayne Stark about this.

26:38.310 --> 26:40.695
Well, two weeks later that arts committee was dissolved.

26:43.021 --> 26:44.003
And then,

26:45.029 --> 26:52.380
they decided that they'd better start hiring staff advisors that they could control.

26:52.440 --> 26:59.511
So they hired Carolyn Adair and she took over the Arts Committee and they said that, you know, that would be the controlling one.

27:00.012 --> 27:03.477
And then Jack Williams, when I was digging around

27:04.385 --> 27:08.068
Finding the plaster cast under the old museum, you knew about that story.

27:08.929 --> 27:14.574
When they tore the museum down, all of the friezes from all over the campus were almost all destroyed.

27:15.355 --> 27:27.646
So anyhow we pulled out the ram's head and pulled out the horse that's on the Old Vet School which is the CE Building and I had the centerpiece and a 55-gallon drum that someday I'll mosaic together.

27:28.467 --> 27:34.392
And so anyhow I brought him by to see him and that's when I was carving on the panels and he said, well you found them.

27:34.372 --> 27:39.500
Just consider them years, you know, do with them what you want.

27:40.201 --> 27:46.350
And so when he and his successors, Miller and who's the other one?

27:47.732 --> 27:48.093
Vandiver?

27:48.694 --> 27:51.778
Well, besides Vandiver, there was an agriculture one.

27:54.182 --> 27:56.566
Oh, you're not talking about Bill Mobley?

27:56.586 --> 27:57.567
No, no, before Mobley.

27:59.210 --> 28:01.493
The one that got in all the trouble with the secretary?

28:02.047 --> 28:04.510
Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's the Chancellor, Hanson.

28:04.810 --> 28:05.891
Hanson, okay.

28:06.011 --> 28:23.590
Well both of those people tried to get them away and they found out about them, you know, and I think Hanson had a secretary phone and said, if you would go ahead and frame them up nicely, you know, in velvet and stuff like that, he would take them as a gift, which I always thought was fun.

28:24.892 --> 28:26.113
And let's see.

28:26.093 --> 28:37.263
Oh, and the only negative thing I had when I first was working on the panels was I'd gone over to the Corps Center and the Corps was really helpful, you know, in supplying me with all sorts of stuff.

28:37.624 --> 28:43.069
And so they gave me a braid because, you know, going from a photograph to carve the braid would be impossible.

28:44.270 --> 28:49.154
And I had a handful of medallion medals, too, that I had to carve.

28:49.875 --> 28:54.379
And he stopped me and, you know, just challenged me, what the hell do you think you're doing with those?

28:54.359 --> 28:57.404
And I said, well, I'm going to carve them.

28:57.424 --> 28:59.206
He said, you better take good care of them.

28:59.266 --> 29:00.989
You shouldn't even have them in your possession.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.092
You know, only Corps people have those sort of things.

29:03.112 --> 29:11.324
And he said, if it were up to me and the rest of the campus, we'd build a 25-foot wall around the architecture building and not let any of you all get out.

29:13.087 --> 29:19.236
So that was Hermit and Brown.

29:22.118 --> 29:23.119
So we went through that one.

29:23.139 --> 29:25.262
Oh, the Italy thing.

29:27.745 --> 29:30.929
The Italy program started back in the 70s with Dan McGillivray.

29:31.129 --> 29:33.371
How did that come about?

29:33.712 --> 29:35.194
Well, we didn't have a study abroad program.

29:35.654 --> 29:44.785
And so he had made some contacts in France and started the program up there.

29:46.064 --> 29:47.947
We were there two or three years.

29:48.468 --> 29:56.781
And then he made contacts in Italy with Paolo Baricieri to set up there.

29:57.422 --> 30:05.896
And then they went for, up till 1988, they went with the Italy program.

30:05.956 --> 30:10.603
And A&M poured in tens of thousands of dollars through student fees and everything else.

30:10.718 --> 30:12.463
And the place was dilapidated.

30:12.884 --> 30:15.352
It was an old monastery that they had fixed up really nicely.

30:15.392 --> 30:16.836
Were you ever there at the Pocherina?

30:17.418 --> 30:18.301
No, I've never been there.

30:18.321 --> 30:23.817
Well, they had patched the thing up, but they needed some more permanent repairs.

30:24.455 --> 30:29.101
And so anyhow, the bishop in Florence had sent out his real estate guy.

30:29.342 --> 30:31.785
They hadn't even bothered with it in eight years to look at it.

30:32.046 --> 30:34.689
And the real estate guy said, hey, you've got a little gold mine there.

30:34.729 --> 30:36.031
That building's in really good shape.

30:36.371 --> 30:39.496
You're not charging them near as much as you should be charging them.

30:39.516 --> 30:43.021
So he was going to like quintriple the rent.

30:43.041 --> 30:45.945
So they sent Sally Shepherd over during the summer.

30:45.965 --> 30:46.846
And I was there that summer.

30:47.407 --> 30:49.770
So Sally came over with her husband and

30:50.358 --> 30:53.803
So we all went into Florence, and she was to go meet with the bishop.

30:54.684 --> 30:59.110
So we were waiting for her for lunch, and we could see her two blocks away.

31:00.072 --> 31:01.193
Some people you can see radiate.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.196
Well, she was stomping.

31:03.917 --> 31:04.578
She was so mad.

31:05.339 --> 31:10.847
And she got there, and we all sat down to lunch, and she said, first of all, they said they couldn't believe

31:10.827 --> 31:17.701
that a major university would send a woman to do business and that they didn't believe that I was a provost.

31:18.022 --> 31:21.149
I had to show them documentation that showed I was a provost.

31:22.071 --> 31:24.075
And then they went on and on and on.

31:24.095 --> 31:27.602
And she said, well, A&M is the one that took that from a rundown.

31:27.622 --> 31:29.967
She had the first photographs to where...
