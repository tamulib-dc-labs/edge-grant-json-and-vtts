00:02.647 --> 00:08.255
I was a sophomore by the time I joined there, so I really didn't get in on that.

00:08.575 --> 00:12.360
Describe the routine of how the house operated, though.

00:13.001 --> 00:15.885
The freshman had the cleaning chores.

00:17.507 --> 00:18.668
Who set the table?

00:19.389 --> 00:20.511
Who cleared the table?

00:20.551 --> 00:21.252
Things like that.

00:21.332 --> 00:22.073
The freshman did that.

00:23.487 --> 00:27.892
We each had to clean our own rooms and that sort of thing.

00:27.912 --> 00:33.097
I don't know how clean they were, but we maintained those.

00:33.137 --> 00:34.999
What were the rules of behavior?

00:39.383 --> 00:41.185
I'm sure there were none, really.

00:42.226 --> 00:44.829
Not that I can remember.

00:45.069 --> 00:48.853
They were just a bunch of guys together.

00:49.458 --> 00:50.579
We got along very well.

00:50.679 --> 00:55.243
I can't remember anyone ever having any major squabble or anything like that.

00:56.484 --> 01:05.913
I'm sure that there were, well, there were some of the guys that sort of acted like that they were seniors and so forth, but it really wasn't there.

01:06.153 --> 01:12.038
It was kind of like play acting compared to what the guys did in the dorms, I'm sure.

01:12.559 --> 01:18.604
What were, about noise, how much could you turn your radio on whenever you wanted to?

01:19.327 --> 01:19.808
Yes.

01:20.789 --> 01:35.553
And one of our, one of my roommates, my, well we four roommates really weren't happy about was that there was a bunch of guys from next to our room.

01:35.593 --> 01:40.541
Of course there was, you could hear it through the walls very well obviously.

01:42.324 --> 01:44.187
On Saturday nights they liked to play.

01:44.892 --> 01:46.974
hillbilly type music and we didn't like that.

01:47.314 --> 01:52.880
But anyway that's, but there were no, I don't remember ever any kind of difficulties that occurred.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.823
Could you bring alcohol to your room?

01:58.606 --> 01:59.026
I don't know.

01:59.446 --> 02:01.929
But if so, I've never seen any.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.492
I assume not, but I don't really know.

02:07.294 --> 02:12.199
Again, since I started there as a sophomore, I wasn't in on the rules per se.

02:12.787 --> 02:18.473
All right, describe a typical week, class day for you.

02:18.533 --> 02:19.614
What time did you get up?

02:19.734 --> 02:20.475
What did you do?

02:20.535 --> 02:24.940
Take me through the whole day when you were living there in the project house.

02:27.122 --> 02:31.126
I think it had more to do with my being raised on the farm.

02:31.226 --> 02:34.570
We always got up about daybreak and the same way there.

02:34.830 --> 02:41.697
And I'd get up and, I guess, take a shower and get cleaned up.

02:42.301 --> 02:46.325
I don't remember shaving, I don't know, yes I did but I'm normal.

02:46.986 --> 02:53.112
And went down to breakfast, which I assume was probably around 6.30 or 7 o'clock or whatever.

02:54.093 --> 02:58.997
And then we just scattered and came back and everybody went different ways.

02:59.017 --> 03:02.100
There was not a lot of horseplay and things like that.

03:02.200 --> 03:09.928
Oh by the way, most of the guys in my house worked somewhere.

03:11.022 --> 03:28.938
Then we'd come home in time for the noon meal, and the noon meal was, we ate a lot of peanut butter, a lot of, it wasn't, you know, fine food, anything like that, but then, of course we joked about the food, but it was substantial, we got by.

03:29.779 --> 03:35.725
And I can't remember us really having any kind of, as the guys do nowadays, hell raising, anything like that.

03:35.765 --> 03:39.308
We just were, we just seemed to be kind of a quiet sort of,

03:40.418 --> 03:43.904
as best I can remember, any difficulty, anything.

03:43.984 --> 03:47.169
Some of them went their own ways sometimes.

03:47.730 --> 03:57.506
Let me say by the way that often, I would say probably most nights during the week, I would go to the library and do my studying there.

03:59.068 --> 04:03.996
Because I guess there was some horseplay, but I was certainly

04:04.533 --> 04:09.822
part of the group, and I'm sure it was liked by the group, but I just spent my time working in the library.

04:09.842 --> 04:17.975
Now, I understand the library was kind of the place for the campus where nobody was bothered, nobody was hazed.

04:18.516 --> 04:20.379
You could go over there and be left alone.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.763
That was correct in my day, at least.

04:22.783 --> 04:25.107
To my knowledge, I never had any problem at all.

04:25.711 --> 04:38.047
Back in that project house, was the house mother also a person that would take charge if somebody needed to be called down?

04:39.449 --> 04:42.073
Would she tell them occasionally to turn the radio down?

04:43.455 --> 04:43.995
I don't know.

04:44.336 --> 04:48.601
I honestly don't remember a case of anybody ever having to be called down or being called down.

04:48.621 --> 04:53.608
Now, again, I spent a lot of time working

04:54.314 --> 04:55.355
and studying away.

04:56.376 --> 05:07.206
So basically I had to say I took my meals there, I slept there, and I just, I guess I'd say I wasn't a loner necessarily, I just didn't spend a lot of time there.

05:07.226 --> 05:09.669
Now you said there were about 25, 35?

05:09.689 --> 05:10.490
36, I'm sure.

05:10.630 --> 05:12.752
36, all right.

05:13.733 --> 05:16.676
How many restroom facilities were there?

05:16.936 --> 05:18.037
Was there one big shower?

05:18.077 --> 05:21.300
Yeah, one big shower and one big

05:21.770 --> 05:27.296
One restroom, so to speak, for everybody.

05:27.837 --> 05:29.078
Remember how many laboratories?

05:30.500 --> 05:31.040
No, I don't.

05:31.561 --> 05:32.982
But I guess there were a good group.

05:33.283 --> 05:36.766
Must have been.

05:36.847 --> 05:39.850
I never encountered any, you know, any that I can remember.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.033
And you went to class every day.

05:43.414 --> 05:44.875
Yes, yes, you bet.

05:45.316 --> 05:47.979
And if I wasn't in class, I was working in between classes.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.882
And I even wore my uniform while I was out.

05:51.537 --> 05:53.260
you know, mowing and what I was doing.

05:54.121 --> 06:01.933
Do you remember in those early days any experiences you had that you realize now were kind of life-changing?

06:04.057 --> 06:07.021
Something you did or didn't do or some advice you got?

06:10.406 --> 06:19.080
Well, no, not particularly, except I guess one of my professors was

06:20.056 --> 06:23.762
influential in pushing me toward doing graduate work.

06:23.782 --> 06:34.319
Although, see, I was left alone until I graduated and then got called to active duty with the Navy and spent about four years there.

06:35.641 --> 06:45.197
At the time I graduated, I had no earthly idea that I would ever go back to any college ever.

06:45.217 --> 06:47.380
And that's a lengthy story about that one.

06:48.068 --> 06:53.176
I was in the Navy for about four years, and I had gotten my commission, and I was on four different ships.

06:55.840 --> 07:03.212
At the end of the war, they decided, how are we going to let people out of the armed forces?

07:04.814 --> 07:07.078
And there was a point system.

07:08.721 --> 07:12.827
And I had accumulated enough points to get out at that point.

07:14.107 --> 07:26.281
And the Navy being what it was, I was on a ship and my old man, we called him, the captain of my ship, declared me essential to that ship.

07:27.202 --> 07:33.710
I was no more essential in the fifth, so-called fifth wheel.

07:34.631 --> 07:38.916
But I really think it was because that good old Navy system they were in.

07:39.841 --> 07:46.107
If he was comparing himself with his buddies, he had to have more officers under him and, you know, all that kind of stuff.

07:46.127 --> 07:46.808
So he wouldn't let me go.

07:48.169 --> 07:48.950
And I stayed there.

07:48.970 --> 07:53.694
And in the meantime, I was getting letters from my wife who said, you know, so-and-so at home, they're doing this.

07:53.755 --> 07:55.076
And I said, man, I've got to get out of here.

07:56.277 --> 08:07.688
So I found out that one of the rules of the game were that if you were going to go to school, then they had to sort of let you out.

08:08.731 --> 08:23.129
So I found out that Texas A&M was going to start a semester in, I guess, it was spring semester of 1946, I guess, and when it was going to start.

08:23.209 --> 08:26.073
So I presented that information, so they let me out.

08:27.034 --> 08:29.297
And that's how I happened to go really to graduate school.

08:29.317 --> 08:30.098
That's part of it.

08:30.365 --> 08:39.507
But the other part of it is that I had heard so much about people in armed forces having problems adjusting to civilian life and all that.

08:40.209 --> 08:41.231
I said, wouldn't that be great?

08:41.412 --> 08:43.798
I will be here near my folks.

08:43.818 --> 08:45.061
My wife was a Brian girl.

08:45.081 --> 08:45.883
I will be here.

08:45.923 --> 08:47.226
And not really that.

08:48.742 --> 08:54.267
I will be somewhere on campus where as jobs come up and I find out about them, I'll have a shot at them.

08:54.487 --> 08:58.371
And so I enrolled in grad school that way, honestly.

08:59.392 --> 09:00.773
All right, let's go back.

09:01.214 --> 09:02.355
You mentioned your wife.

09:02.735 --> 09:02.835
Yeah.

09:02.855 --> 09:08.140
Describe your social life in those four undergraduate years.

09:08.160 --> 09:08.461
Okay.

09:09.782 --> 09:12.064
We met when I was a sophomore.

09:12.084 --> 09:17.449
And we went to, we were,

09:18.458 --> 09:21.402
Well, we dated each other all throughout that time.

09:23.525 --> 09:24.166
How did you meet?

09:26.929 --> 09:28.571
Kind of a roundabout way.

09:28.592 --> 09:37.243
A friend of mine that I was in orchestra with went to Sam Houston, and he had come to ride to Bryan.

09:37.882 --> 09:53.747
to uh he was going to go home and there was a kid that i went to school with at snoke he was working downtown uh in bryan and he was talking to him and said i need i i got this far out would you

09:53.913 --> 09:57.918
could you sort of help me back to get home to Snook?

09:57.938 --> 10:08.551
And the guy says, yeah, but he decided to ask a girl, the girl he liked, if she would ride out to Snook with him.

10:09.592 --> 10:16.361
And this young lady says, yeah, but if my girlfriend, you know, if my real friend could go with us.

10:16.381 --> 10:17.542
So that's how we happened to meet.

10:18.623 --> 10:22.468
So we went to Snook for the first time.

10:22.448 --> 10:30.880
All right, now, as you began to date... Anyway, so as we began to date and all that, I had very, very little money.

10:31.200 --> 10:36.988
And so we were, you know, we either stayed at her house or we went to the movies.

10:37.008 --> 10:42.856
And by the way, in those days, there were two movies in downtown Bryan.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.660
One was a palace and the other was a queen.

10:46.842 --> 10:51.308
And I may be wrong, but I think the queen was maybe 15 cents, something like that.

10:51.828 --> 10:56.394
The palace, it was much, much higher, maybe 30 cents, I don't know.

10:56.414 --> 11:01.701
And I never really had enough, you know, I didn't feel like I had enough cushion that we could go to the palace.

11:01.721 --> 11:06.467
So we'd always go to Queen and go to the cheap movies.

11:07.188 --> 11:12.735
And by the way, her home was in the walking distance of downtown, just real close.

11:13.476 --> 11:15.238
And so we'd just walk.

11:15.318 --> 11:19.624
And I would catch a ride every time, going to Bryan.

11:20.228 --> 11:22.896
and spend some time with her.

11:23.799 --> 11:25.684
About 10 o'clock or so, I'd head back home.

11:25.704 --> 11:27.690
I'd catch a ride back to the campus, and that was it.

11:29.215 --> 11:33.327
And by the way, in those days, there were cabs.

11:34.032 --> 11:42.342
They would take as many as, they would take seven or eight, and they were 10 cents a piece, I might recall that, at least some point when I was there.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.345
But I never wrote a cab.

11:45.566 --> 11:48.290
I was really, seriously, I was really pushed with money.

11:48.610 --> 11:51.994
And I guess I was tight, just to be honest about it, too.

11:52.014 --> 11:54.257
I wasn't going to spend my money that way.

11:56.220 --> 12:03.769
Now, if you were going to splurge, what would you have done other than a movie?

12:04.053 --> 12:33.351
Oh, okay, we would have gone, at that time, across the street from them was a drugstore, and they had a regular fountain, so we'd get ourselves a cream soda or something like that, I'm not sure, probably a dime or something like that in those days, but we didn't splurge much, but that was my whole, yeah, I was trying to think of a place, Shiloh was the place I was trying to think of back here in those days, and we'd go to dances, by the way,

12:34.107 --> 12:46.779
And her mother loved to go to dances and so she would go with us I guess for whatever reason and we'd go to dances and things like that.

12:47.099 --> 12:47.900
We did that a lot.

12:49.261 --> 12:56.128
And at least on two occasions I remember going to a big time dance in Spisa Hall when we had really big name bands.

12:57.029 --> 12:59.871
Once we had Russ Morgan I remember.

12:59.891 --> 13:03.675
And I think we had one of the Dorces here also one time.

13:04.347 --> 13:09.592
And in those days, by the way, the Aggieland Orchestra was really very, very good.

13:12.535 --> 13:16.778
I'm anxious to learn anything you know about the Aggieland Orchestra.

13:17.139 --> 13:18.020
Who was that?

13:18.100 --> 13:18.720
Who led it?

13:18.820 --> 13:19.481
Who was in it?

13:21.923 --> 13:28.930
Russ Hillier, who was from the family that has a Hillier funeral home, he was one of those leaders.

13:29.931 --> 13:32.633
And I can show you in, no, yeah.

13:32.900 --> 13:35.544
If you go back to my annual, there are some pictures of those.

13:35.925 --> 13:37.187
Were they students?

13:37.307 --> 13:39.010
Oh yeah, 100% students.

13:39.190 --> 13:44.779
But they were good, and they had a big-time band, big-name band arrangements.

13:44.839 --> 13:49.526
I don't know how they got them, but they sounded just like the big bands.

13:50.187 --> 13:53.372
How was a young woman treated at an Aggie dance?

13:56.052 --> 14:02.722
All I can say is very courteously, you know, I think she was treated very, very fine.

14:02.862 --> 14:11.635
As far as I know, I don't suppose I made an Aggie dance over four times, and one of those no doubt was my senior ball.

14:14.239 --> 14:23.072
We had our own dates, and of course we had our own set of friends that we sort of teamed up with.

14:23.812 --> 14:30.538
I don't remember really exchanging our dates and dancing with them.

14:30.639 --> 14:32.520
We just danced with our own, pretty much.

14:33.181 --> 14:36.764
When I asked one man that question, he said they were treated almost like royalty.

14:37.125 --> 14:38.166
Well, I guess that's true.

14:38.246 --> 14:39.006
That's true.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.428
Very true, yeah.

14:40.508 --> 14:41.369
It was a big deal.

14:41.389 --> 14:44.752
And the behavior of everyone was quite good, I understand.

14:44.792 --> 14:45.693
Oh, no, no question.

14:45.713 --> 14:51.118
And I really, of course, you know, I didn't get around like some of them did, but I never,

14:51.487 --> 14:56.492
ever saw an Aggie that was drunk or out of line in any way.

14:57.653 --> 15:01.197
I never saw a so-called fight between two or anything like that.

15:01.277 --> 15:05.361
It was just a, I don't know, maybe it's just where I was at that time.

15:07.964 --> 15:08.704
Very well done.

15:09.465 --> 15:17.393
Can you describe how the routine on the campus began to change after December 7, 1941?

15:19.837 --> 15:26.927
Well, the main thing was that there were other units.

15:27.227 --> 15:31.092
I think the Navy had a unit, some kind of training unit on campus.

15:34.797 --> 15:45.912
There were probably maybe even others, but as students it really didn't change for us because they were housed sort of separately and there was a place

15:46.482 --> 15:54.497
George's, what it was, Confectionary, what it was, that's about, where was it?

15:55.138 --> 15:55.900
I don't know.

15:55.920 --> 15:56.721
What's that right now?

15:56.821 --> 15:58.184
Well I do know kind of where it was.

15:59.006 --> 16:02.692
It was south of the library.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.999
You probably heard about George's Confectionary.

16:06.019 --> 16:09.385
Anyway, that was sort of a gathering place in Greenpeace.

16:09.854 --> 16:15.482
But I can't, I really, you know, I'm sorry, I'm digressing from the question.

16:15.502 --> 16:20.829
All right, didn't they start moving y'all forward faster?

16:20.869 --> 16:24.273
You started going around the clock 12 months a year?

16:24.454 --> 16:34.127
Yes, and my graduation was in 1942, and instead of it being in normal May, I think it was April.

16:35.468 --> 16:38.933
And incidentally, our commencement speaker was Ike Eisenhower.

16:39.098 --> 16:39.759
Really?

16:39.779 --> 16:40.980
Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.102
Do you remember any impression you had of him?

16:43.162 --> 16:44.704
No, I was just graduating.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.788
Where was the ceremony held?

16:48.808 --> 16:55.034
Oh, the graduation ceremony was always held on Kyle Field itself.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.796
Who came for you?

16:57.437 --> 16:58.478
Who was there?

16:59.359 --> 17:00.980
What special family or friends?

17:03.783 --> 17:07.587
My mother and dad came, and of course my girlfriend.

17:11.819 --> 17:13.761
And I don't remember.

17:14.122 --> 17:15.563
I think probably my brother.

17:16.665 --> 17:19.748
Not only that, my brother probably was the TU guy.

17:19.768 --> 17:24.754
He was the guy who brought them and made it possible for them to come, as a matter of fact.

17:24.774 --> 17:31.682
And was every name called and a diploma handed to each one of you, kind of like we do it now?

17:31.802 --> 17:33.324
I kind of think so.

17:33.344 --> 17:36.628
So there's a handshake and all that.

17:37.942 --> 17:39.424
I'm not positive.

17:39.464 --> 17:42.089
Did you go through final review?

17:45.514 --> 17:46.135
Or were you?

17:46.155 --> 17:50.322
No, I, let's see, did I?

17:50.863 --> 17:57.293
You see, we still, even though I was not in ROTC law, we still were kind of attached in a sense.

17:58.254 --> 18:04.504
Not fully, but we sort of, I don't believe that I was in final review.

18:05.085 --> 18:05.586
I really don't believe.

18:07.068 --> 18:16.940
All right, about other A&M traditions, do you remember when you first went to Silver Taps?

18:18.722 --> 18:23.628
Or do you remember Silver Taps when you... No, I don't remember anything going on.

18:23.649 --> 18:24.590
What about Bonfire?

18:26.472 --> 18:32.339
Did you help gather up some of the rubbish and the... No, no, nothing like that.

18:32.479 --> 18:32.940
Mustard?

18:37.493 --> 18:38.534
I don't remember that either.

18:38.954 --> 18:41.997
Did you go on any court trips?

18:42.618 --> 18:42.858
No.

18:42.878 --> 18:43.859
During football season?

18:43.899 --> 18:45.141
No.

18:45.161 --> 18:46.382
Did you go to football games?

18:46.762 --> 18:46.942
Yes.

18:46.962 --> 18:47.443
Home games?

18:47.523 --> 18:57.593
Yes, but I went there because in order to earn money, I sold cokes or peanuts or popcorn or something like that.

18:58.914 --> 19:04.800
But as far as I know, I never, in those days, the guys had a,

19:05.911 --> 19:09.735
coupon book, something like that, that I assume they paid for.

19:10.516 --> 19:12.357
I never owned one, never did.

19:13.178 --> 19:19.284
And I would go to some things, but it was always somebody would say, hey, you want to go over here?

19:19.304 --> 19:20.926
I'm not going to get my coupon book.

19:21.386 --> 19:22.427
I never paid for that.

19:23.488 --> 19:24.549
I was really strapped for money.

19:24.569 --> 19:26.451
I'm not kidding.

19:26.471 --> 19:35.260
How far away, before you left, before you graduated and left for the service, how far away had you traveled?

19:37.552 --> 19:44.239
Well, I had been to Houston several times.

19:44.339 --> 19:50.225
Oh, by the way, even in high school, our band had concerts at Baylor.

19:50.385 --> 20:00.816
And by the way, in the Centennial, even though I had graduated from high school, the Caldwell High School band was one of those that played at the state.

20:00.856 --> 20:03.799
The Centennial in Dallas?

20:03.819 --> 20:04.099
Yes.

20:04.653 --> 20:06.955
And we stayed there a couple of days.

20:06.975 --> 20:10.198
And so I got to stay in hotels and all that sort of stuff.

20:10.218 --> 20:13.661
By the way, there was a terrific band named Jan Garber.

20:13.841 --> 20:16.243
Man, he had beautiful music.

20:16.263 --> 20:25.191
Anyway, so I, but I had, and of course in the National Guard, I had gone to Louisiana to Fort, what was it?

20:25.272 --> 20:25.592
Polk?

20:26.813 --> 20:27.814
Yeah, out there.

20:28.975 --> 20:34.660
And I had gone there, but I had not really, oh, I'm wrong too.

20:34.893 --> 20:43.747
Also, in high school, I was fortunate enough to be chosen, I guess you'd say, as a part of what they call the FFA Texas Band.

20:44.648 --> 20:49.756
And I went to Texas City with that band, Texas FFA Band.

20:50.537 --> 20:54.223
No, I went to Kansas City, in which we participated in that.

20:54.243 --> 20:55.185
Ooh, big drip.

20:55.385 --> 20:57.068
That's right, you bet.

20:57.128 --> 20:57.929
Went on the train?

20:58.109 --> 20:59.972
Yeah, yeah, sure.

21:01.640 --> 21:07.507
Let's see, do you remember any other famous campus visitors?

21:07.647 --> 21:09.089
You mentioned Dwight Eisenhower.

21:11.131 --> 21:15.316
Sure, let's see, other famous ones.

21:15.336 --> 21:16.417
Presidents, governors.

21:17.498 --> 21:21.823
Well, I'm sure Linden, let's see.

21:22.304 --> 21:24.306
No, before, while you were an undergraduate.

21:27.863 --> 21:28.143
No.

21:29.184 --> 21:33.828
I'm sure there were some generals, but I wasn't all that into ROTC.

21:33.848 --> 21:35.690
All right.

21:36.690 --> 21:41.815
Who were some of the closest buddies you had as undergraduates?

21:41.835 --> 21:43.056
Who were your closest friends?

21:44.097 --> 21:44.417
Okay.

21:44.877 --> 21:49.861
My closest friends were those that were in my project houses.

21:50.962 --> 21:52.884
Joe Bert Nash was one of them from Normandy.

21:54.686 --> 21:57.668
John Box from Centerville.

21:58.778 --> 22:06.679
Then there were people like a guy that was a year, he was a junior when I was a senior, Hubert Faust.

22:07.503 --> 22:15.496
It was from Granberry, near Fort Worth out there somewhere.

22:15.997 --> 22:20.825
I guess the closest buddy I ever had at that time was a guy by the name of Smith.

22:20.845 --> 22:28.317
Charles Smith, I believe, his nickname was Pudgy, and he was called Fats the Smith.

22:28.337 --> 22:33.105
And he and his buddies, and another guy was Joe Ruth.

22:33.710 --> 22:36.915
They lived out somewhere out around Millica.

22:37.776 --> 22:43.665
And they would come in and I met them through, again, I think at the boarding alley.

22:43.685 --> 22:45.208
They were a great, great town.

22:45.248 --> 22:49.194
Joe Ruth turned out to be an Episcopal bishop.

22:49.214 --> 22:52.319
And just, you know, they were fine.

22:52.419 --> 22:57.847
And Fads was from Abilene, near Abilene.

22:58.188 --> 23:01.573
And Fads and I got killed in the war.

23:02.887 --> 23:06.811
Joe died within the last five or six years.

23:07.432 --> 23:17.884
Those were, I guess, my best buddies, and I knew them basically through, again, being at the bowling alley and so forth.

23:17.904 --> 23:20.367
You know, our friendships evolved from that.

23:20.387 --> 23:21.088
That was the beginning.

23:21.248 --> 23:30.278
I remember going to, I guess, Senior Ball with Joe Ruth and his girlfriend and all that sort of stuff, probably, yeah.

23:30.697 --> 23:33.461
All right, student indulgences during that time.

23:34.082 --> 23:34.563
Smoking?

23:38.488 --> 23:39.650
Did many students smoke?

23:43.135 --> 23:43.936
Not that I know of.

23:44.437 --> 23:49.725
And in our project house, I really, I can't recall anybody smoking.

23:50.145 --> 23:51.066
All right, what about drinking?

23:52.869 --> 23:54.932
Well, let's put it this way.

23:55.570 --> 24:00.075
There was this common thing that supposedly has happened.

24:00.095 --> 24:06.541
There was a place south of us, not too far, called Ed Hart Liquors.

24:06.581 --> 24:17.072
Some of the guys would go there, and like some Saturdays or Saturday nights, and I'm told, and I'm assuming it's correct, they would drink quite a bit of beer.

24:17.172 --> 24:20.375
As a matter of fact, maybe skunk drunk, if that's the case.

24:21.236 --> 24:23.839
But again, I wasn't in on that, because

24:25.068 --> 24:30.255
I guess you think I was strictly a loner, maybe I was, but any time I had my girlfriend and other things.

24:31.217 --> 24:34.902
Right now, I haven't heard much about whiskey, though, during that era.

24:34.922 --> 24:40.249
No, I don't remember any partaking thereof or any, never heard of it.

24:41.151 --> 24:42.893
And I mean, it wasn't there, I just didn't.

24:42.913 --> 24:47.980
Was there, as far as you know, was there a bootlegger in Brazos County for whiskey?

24:48.120 --> 24:49.022
No, no, no.

24:49.042 --> 24:53.628
I do know that there used to be a lot of talk about it.

24:53.648 --> 24:54.990
You know, if this is in fact,

24:55.848 --> 24:59.733
But again, Aggies in our days love to brag about things.

24:59.753 --> 25:02.797
I often wondered if they were really just saying this.

25:03.778 --> 25:07.063
But they started talking about going across what they call Whiskey Bridge over here.

25:08.124 --> 25:10.127
Now, I don't know.

25:10.167 --> 25:13.751
Did that exist when you were a student?

25:14.632 --> 25:16.054
There wasn't enough traffic, was there?

25:17.056 --> 25:20.760
Well, on that one occasion, yeah.

25:21.141 --> 25:24.285
But remember, again, by the time I graduated,

25:25.497 --> 25:29.102
The hard surface road was in there, I believe.

25:29.263 --> 25:29.663
Okay.

25:30.605 --> 25:32.147
All the way to the lines, I do believe.

25:33.028 --> 25:45.066
There was a field that the Bryan Air Base used, sort of a practice to land on whatnot, let's see, just south of Snook there.

25:46.368 --> 25:49.232
And I think that had more to do with that than anything else.

25:49.913 --> 25:50.394
Okay.

25:50.414 --> 25:53.158
You know, they needed that, so they had this hard surface road.

25:54.421 --> 25:56.864
All right, let's go back to academically.

25:57.685 --> 26:02.571
When did you settle in on being a rural sociology major?

26:03.673 --> 26:05.014
Or is that what it was called?

26:05.375 --> 26:10.401
Yeah, that's what it's called, absolutely.

26:10.421 --> 26:18.471
That had to be probably either the beginning

26:19.531 --> 26:22.717
I guess the beginning of my sophomore year, I assume.

26:23.298 --> 26:23.698
Okay.

26:23.718 --> 26:27.725
If not, it was certainly the second semester of my sophomore year.

26:28.386 --> 26:33.395
And what did you think that was going to lead you to do in your future?

26:33.415 --> 26:43.733
Well, I had heard about things, for example, I remember thinking how nice it would be, one of the things that there was to be a

26:44.978 --> 26:49.926
big federal prison in, around, somewhere in Dallas.

26:50.627 --> 26:53.432
You know, like that employment was something like that.

26:53.472 --> 26:58.620
There was, I really didn't, I guess that's about it.

26:58.640 --> 27:03.088
I really didn't know what I was going to do.

27:03.108 --> 27:08.877
As you were preparing to leave, to graduate and leave, to go off to war,

27:10.072 --> 27:37.446
uh did you and your friends how long did you all think the war was going to last did you have any gas i didn't really uh i didn't think it lasted as long as it did obviously but i i wasn't really you know i really wasn't knowledgeable about it i'll be honest with you i knew little about what was going on i didn't i wasn't one of these guys who picked up the paper and read it daily who did you think was going to win the war

27:39.164 --> 27:42.689
Well, there was no doubt in my mind because I was just among it.

27:43.269 --> 27:46.153
That's all I heard.

27:47.034 --> 27:55.044
I think today's students are surprised at that because I've had many students say, well, what about all the opponents of the war?

27:55.505 --> 27:56.366
I tell them there were none.

27:57.548 --> 27:59.891
And well, did y'all think we'd win?

28:00.471 --> 28:01.573
That wasn't a doubt.

28:02.834 --> 28:07.180
See, one of the difficulties, not difficulties, but one thing I felt badly about was that

28:07.936 --> 28:24.017
I graduated from college, and we were supposed to, as soon as we graduated, the Registrar's Office was to send to the Navy people the proof that we had graduated, and so here we go.

28:24.858 --> 28:35.412
Well, apparently, the Registrar's Office did not send them the notice that I had graduated, and so I graduated, and

28:35.932 --> 28:54.902
thought, well, I'm going any day, so I went back home, and I kind of hung around there a little bit, and they didn't call me, they didn't call me, and I really felt, really kind of, I shall say it, kind of, not ashamed, but thinking,

28:55.304 --> 28:58.889
God, all these guys are gone, and someone's getting killed and all that, and I'm still here.

28:59.210 --> 29:00.692
What do these people think of me, you know?

29:01.733 --> 29:06.460
And I'd tell them, well, I'm going to the Navy, but that's, you know, I had no real proof of that.

29:07.282 --> 29:11.167
So they didn't call me and say, I graduated, I believe it was April, but it was.

29:11.828 --> 29:13.591
And I didn't get called until November.

29:14.152 --> 29:14.913
Oh.

29:14.933 --> 29:22.785
That was long, but that was because, again, they had, and so finally, there's Governor Al Giesenslaw, that graduated with me.

29:23.105 --> 29:25.108
He was already in midshipment school and all that.

29:25.595 --> 29:27.918
So I have it in my files.

29:28.039 --> 29:41.018
I wrote to the Navy Center in New Orleans, I guess it was, and said, hey, I'm still here, and I've not heard from you, and my buddies are gone, and what about this?

29:41.839 --> 29:45.645
And they apparently wrote back and said, we don't have any record of you doing this.

29:46.047 --> 29:49.718
So I went to Ray Starr's office and said, hey, what's going on?

29:50.259 --> 29:52.366
They sent it, and bingo, I got back in.

29:52.967 --> 30:00.951
I really felt, I shall say it, probably not ashamed, but nevertheless, I felt really

30:01.420 --> 30:02.221
Kind of out of place.

30:02.962 --> 30:03.743
Awkward at least.

30:03.823 --> 30:04.424
Yeah, that's right.

30:04.484 --> 30:04.784
Awkward.

30:04.804 --> 30:05.345
That's right.

30:05.365 --> 30:06.026
Good word for it.

30:06.066 --> 30:06.907
When did you get married?

30:08.829 --> 30:09.570
Before you left?

30:09.630 --> 30:10.031
No, no, no.

30:10.051 --> 30:10.492
Oh.

30:11.252 --> 30:22.327
So after midshipman school, I got my commission, and I got assigned to a ship in San Francisco.

30:23.188 --> 30:24.289
It was an ammunition ship.

30:25.383 --> 30:35.813
We took on live ammunition and we delivered it to the fleet out there as they needed it and stayed out of the way if they got the big battles so that we'd blow up everybody ourselves.

30:36.354 --> 30:43.801
Anyway, I had made a trip out to South Pacific State, I believe about maybe 13 months, something like that.

30:43.821 --> 30:45.342
I'm not sure.

30:45.362 --> 30:48.665
And, you know, it wasn't been the way.

30:48.685 --> 30:49.506
It was a long time.

30:50.808 --> 30:52.369
And I found out that we were

30:54.543 --> 30:55.044
Yeah.

30:55.064 --> 31:06.304
I found out that we were going to be, I wasn't supposed to know this, but somehow I found out that we were going to be back in San Francisco and that we were going to be due for some overhaul and that sort of thing.

31:06.324 --> 31:13.978
So I wrote my girlfriend, hey, we're supposed to be in San Francisco.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.062
I'm going to be there maybe for a month or so.

31:16.531 --> 31:24.972
I think it would be a good idea if he'd come out and... Oh, my goodness.
