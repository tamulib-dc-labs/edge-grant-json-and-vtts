00:06.224 --> 00:19.860
What is the current impact and what

00:06.224 --> 00:19.860
will be the future impact of the black women in 
athletics? The current impact? They're good.

00:22.584 --> 00:22.884
They're strong. They're real good. I can't 
understand. I wish I knew more about physiology

00:24.126 --> 00:27.810
because It's

00:29.174 --> 00:40.180
funny that in the United States, I'm talking about 
track now, the black women are better sprinters,

00:29.174 --> 00:40.180
better jumpers, better runners, of course, 
because they're stronger. Distance events,

00:40.396 --> 00:51.232
they're lacking in that area. But you can look at my 
team picture in a minute, and there weren't very

00:51.252 --> 00:54.717
many white girls on the team. They seem to just kind 
of, they've taken over all the events, and I don't

00:54.737 --> 01:04.851
really know why, because you go to, you see the 
German teams, the Russian teams, who are beating

00:54.737 --> 01:04.851
our teams, that are all black, their teams are all 
white. Now, I know drugs enter a little bit there,

01:05.101 --> 01:22.664
but I'm not so naive to think that our women are 
probably not on drugs, too. Probably not as

01:22.684 --> 01:23.725
heavily as they are. And not all the girls. But I 
don't understand that. I think the black women

01:24.787 --> 01:26.569
athletes are going to be an incentive to the 
younger black women.

01:30.025 --> 01:45.351
I've

01:30.025 --> 01:45.351
coached over the years on the junior high and high 
school level, and I always tried to pick out, like,

01:30.025 --> 01:45.351
Evelyn Ashford is our best American sprinter. I 
would put her poster in the locker room and talk

01:45.371 --> 01:48.456
about her and Wilma Rudolph, and I think that 
inspires those kids, those young people.

01:56.232 --> 02:08.910
With the increased money being spent on women's 
athletics, do you feel the recruitment

01:56.232 --> 02:08.910
of women athletes will become more intense in the 
future? I think it will. I don't think it will ever

02:09.470 --> 02:12.875
be. Well, it may be. But it will be a while before 
it's as bad as men's recruiting problems that we

02:16.540 --> 02:18.443
have. it's tough,

02:20.161 --> 02:30.758
especially when that money comes in, because 
those girls will go anywhere. You know, it was

02:30.838 --> 02:34.224
really easy when there was one school with a little 
bit of money, or everybody was pretty equal. The

02:34.244 --> 02:38.170
problem is, you've got major colleges with a lot of 
money, and some of the colleges that have stronger

02:38.150 --> 02:49.034
women's programs than what the major college 
does, they don't have so much money. And that's a

02:49.054 --> 02:51.780
real problem for them. So it's not real equal. So 
it's gonna come down to, it's not right now, But I

02:55.109 --> 03:02.921
think it probably will end up who's going to give 
the most money. I hear

03:02.941 --> 03:12.035
a lot of girls now, it's funny to hear them say, 
well, maybe I'll get a car, maybe I'll get this,

03:02.941 --> 03:12.035
maybe I'll get some extra money here. They've seen 
the men get it, and they think they're going to get

03:12.055 --> 03:15.441
it now. I didn't hear that when I was in school. 
Thought never crossed your mind. But now, if

03:17.323 --> 03:21.971
you're really good, you can hold out for a better 
deal. And women are getting to that point. I hope it

03:24.505 --> 03:28.590
didn't happen, but I think it probably will. What 
was your reaction of being the first woman

03:28.610 --> 03:37.181
inducted into the Texas A&M Hall of Fame? Do you 
feel there should be such an institution, Texas

03:37.201 --> 03:42.147
A&M? Yeah, I think it's good to have... the

03:45.717 --> 04:03.216
Hall of Fame, I think it's going to have the 
Worker's Student Association, and everybody

03:45.717 --> 04:03.216
kind of has their own area. I was in shock when I got 
it. As a matter of fact, I'm on the board of

04:04.798 --> 04:11.906
directors of the Letterman's Association, and I 
know they do that every year, but I never expected

04:04.798 --> 04:11.906
it for myself. And it was almost like I thought, 
well, maybe I'm not worthy of it to be put up there

04:11.926 --> 04:14.188
with those demands. I still feel that way.

04:22.406 --> 04:33.349
A lot of people told me I'm stupid for

04:22.406 --> 04:33.349
thinking that because in their eyes and for what I 
do, it's just as good as what Curtis Dickman would

04:22.406 --> 04:33.349
do. But it really surprised me and I wasn't 
expecting it at all.

04:39.110 --> 04:45.200
I'm proud that I was chosen for it. I'm real proud 
that I was the first because I was also the first on

04:45.220 --> 04:56.398
the scholarship at A&M for a male-led program. I 
was the first female on a full athletic

04:56.418 --> 04:58.481
scholarship at A&M. So it kind of went step and step 
with that. But my harsh reaction when the guy

04:59.503 --> 05:01.306
called me was, are you sure you have the right 
person? And he kept saying, well, I think so.

05:04.110 --> 05:04.531
Didn't you first say? No.

05:08.438 --> 05:11.907
Jackie Sherrill has made major changes 
concerning women's athletics. This firing of Kay

05:12.188 --> 05:15.417
Dawn came under scrutiny. Do you feel women's 
athletics at A&M will grow under Jackie Sherrill?

05:19.408 --> 05:22.937
Well, see that, first of all, Kay Dawn and I were 
very... And I loved her a lot. She supported me. In

05:31.280 --> 05:40.968
1980, she went around

05:31.280 --> 05:40.968
to all the Aggie clubs and got them to donate money 
so that I could travel. I ran under Texas A&M Track

05:40.988 --> 05:41.669
Club. And my money for my travel was all given to 
these former Aggies. She did a lot for me. I think

05:48.134 --> 05:50.276
she did a lot for Amy while she was here. My gosh, 
before she came, we didn't have any money. And I

05:52.197 --> 05:52.958
knew when that happened I don't

05:53.545 --> 06:10.410
really

05:53.545 --> 06:10.410
know the nitty-gritty of it all, but I know it was 
really bad. I like Lynn Hickey. I think she's going

06:11.111 --> 06:11.873
to do a good job. Sometimes I wonder how coaches 
like Jackie Sherrill, who are athletic

06:11.893 --> 06:13.495
directors, also coach

06:13.812 --> 06:32.251
and

06:13.812 --> 06:32.251
keep their mind equal for all sports. It might be a 
better deal if you had someone like K-9 who wasn't

06:32.271 --> 06:35.775
the basketball coach or the track coach. Then 
again on the other side of the coin, if you're a

06:35.795 --> 06:39.499
coach you know what you need, the wants and needs of 
your athletes and hopefully you can see that in

06:35.795 --> 06:39.499
other sports too. I think you can't help but have

06:39.698 --> 06:54.363
the women's programs at A&M improve. I don't think 
they were that bad. I think they were really

06:55.064 --> 06:58.751
growing for a while, and they kind of were in a 
slump, and I think that might be what happened

06:55.064 --> 06:58.751
there. I'm not real sure what Jackie Sherrill's 
done. I mean, I got a letter from him, which I

06:59.832 --> 07:01.175
thought would be nice. Mm-hmm.

07:05.534 --> 07:08.442
And I'm sure it will grow. I think if he's the kind of 
man that I think he is, he's going to want A&M. He's

07:15.543 --> 07:16.506
looking at it for A&M, not... You're

07:18.798 --> 07:33.902
going to have to put your things in perspective.

07:33.922 --> 07:39.992
You want A&M to have good programs, not just the men 
to have good programs, but A&M as a whole. And

07:40.012 --> 07:41.875
athletics should be men's athletics and women's 
should be athletics and A&M. And we have both

07:41.895 --> 07:43.017
sexes, you know, but playboy opposites. So I think 
it's going to grow, and I think it will grow with him

07:43.037 --> 07:44.980
because I think he's smart. He's a smart person, 
and I think he knows what he needs. And

07:46.760 --> 07:55.519
I think John David Crowe does, too. And it was real 
funny. Everybody kept apologizing to me at the

07:57.263 --> 07:59.267
press conference they called after I had received 
the award. I was

07:59.720 --> 08:18.986
really kind of shocked that they were apologizing 
to me because they felt like they hadn't done

07:59.720 --> 08:18.986
enough for me for the accomplishments that I had 
gotten. Which, you know, I never really felt that

08:19.006 --> 08:22.531
way. And then after I kept apologizing to them, 
then I started thinking, well, You

08:25.943 --> 08:44.613
know,

08:25.943 --> 08:44.613
if I had

08:25.943 --> 08:44.613
been a man, if I had made a team, maybe I wouldn't 
have come. Of course, I wasn't a world record

08:44.633 --> 08:45.855
holder like Randy Mattson. You know, I think he's, 
gosh. See, I still think of myself as not near as

08:46.557 --> 08:47.819
good as a man. I just, it really, I don't, you know, 
and I don't think I can go in there expecting the

08:47.839 --> 08:50.483
same things that Randy Mattson does.

08:57.533 --> 09:00.259
It was real funny that they kept apologizing to me. 
I kept wondering why they were apologizing to me.

09:04.587 --> 09:07.433
They just kept saying, we hadn't done enough for 
you. I just can't believe you did this. We've never

09:08.916 --> 09:09.457
recognized you. We've done enough. Which kind of 
makes you, then you go, well, yeah, maybe you had to

09:10.949 --> 09:17.519
recognize me enough, but I never had felt that way. 
I think I was dealt a good love, and especially

09:17.680 --> 09:25.512
since they supported me after I had graduated. 
They had given me all the money, and it took a lot of

09:25.532 --> 09:31.020
money to send me, because all the meets that I 
competed in were pretty much in the West Coast. So

09:31.040 --> 09:36.749
every pentathlon meet I went to, it was like 
getting on a plane, it was like a major trip. So I've

09:42.623 --> 09:56.487
What do you feel is the future of collegiate

09:42.623 --> 09:56.487
women's

09:42.623 --> 09:56.487
athletics? Well, I think they're going to really 
grow. I think they're going to start getting some

09:57.609 --> 09:59.513
publicity on television. We're seeing more of 
that, more of the nationals being televised.

10:06.856 --> 10:22.420
and

10:06.856 --> 10:22.420
they don't keep brains on it, like they're not 
meant to. Because, well, this year in particular,

10:22.440 --> 10:25.405
it'll come to, you know, all the crew and props that 
they had, and it could happen with tremendous

10:22.440 --> 10:25.405
progress. With

10:26.212 --> 10:47.812
the growth

10:26.212 --> 10:47.812
rate that we're going to see, we're going to be very 
careful and watch what we're posting. And

10:47.832 --> 10:50.054
publicity-wise, that will increase, which may 
also help the professional programs that we're

10:47.832 --> 10:50.054
talking about. It's like you can't start anything 
in college until you get your high school programs

10:50.074 --> 10:51.916
going. You can't do anything professional until 
you've got your college programs working. So the

10:53.597 --> 10:54.278
101 would be the end of it. This is the last 
question. Do you feel that women's athletics will

10:57.539 --> 11:03.566
ever be the same as men's athletics as far as 
funding? No. No, no. That's what we get for Eve

11:05.388 --> 11:09.072
getting Adam to athlete. No, I don't. I think...

11:14.378 --> 11:18.002
I just don't think it ever will be. Maybe 50 years 
from now it might be, but in the very... near to 30

11:23.080 --> 11:35.580
years from now

11:23.080 --> 11:35.580
type future, I don't think that it would be. I don't 
know why. I think maybe one reason why is the men's

11:37.403 --> 11:40.768
program's football is the biggest moneymaker.

11:43.634 --> 12:03.472
And

11:43.634 --> 12:03.472
they're

11:43.634 --> 12:03.472
going to get the most publicity on television, 
professional,

11:43.634 --> 12:03.472
and NCAA. And even in high school, they do. So men 
are going to always be caught because of football.

12:06.715 --> 12:07.676
And that's always going to be the biggest sport. 
Then you're going to . I don't think they'll ever be

12:08.156 --> 12:08.977
equal. We'll be running close, but I don't think 
they'll ever be equal. And we may be equal in

12:10.838 --> 12:11.599
certain sports. But

12:12.338 --> 12:33.445
the bigger

12:12.338 --> 12:33.445
sports, basketball, women's basketball will 
never be equal to men's basketball. Track,

12:33.465 --> 12:34.026
they're pretty equal. I'm going to have to admit 
they are. Right now, they're under one coach.

12:35.508 --> 12:36.208
Smaller sports tend to be that way. Swimming, 
pretty equal. You see the Olympic swimming, the

12:36.709 --> 12:38.211
NCAA swimming, it's usually the same way. High

12:39.001 --> 12:53.985
schools now, in track, they're going, state meets 
are the same. They used to be separate. The girls'

12:56.088 --> 12:57.931
state was this weekend, the boys' was this 
weekend, now they're the same weekend. So you can

12:57.951 --> 12:59.494
see some improvements there, and it'll probably 
come around now. Nationals will probably end up

12:59.514 --> 13:00.716
being the same weekend, too. The end of the 
nationals, NCAA, in track, will probably be the

13:00.736 --> 13:02.258
same weekend.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.378
That's it. That's it.
