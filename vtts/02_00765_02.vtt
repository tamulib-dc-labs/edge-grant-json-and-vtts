00:06.157 --> 00:19.574
What is the current impact and what

00:06.157 --> 00:19.574
will be the future impact of the black women in 
athletics? The current impact? They're good.

00:22.037 --> 00:22.337
They're strong. They're real good. I can't 
understand. I wish I knew

00:23.138 --> 00:27.844
more about physiology because It's

00:29.107 --> 00:49.552
funny

00:29.107 --> 00:49.552
that

00:29.107 --> 00:49.552
in the United States, I'm talking about track now, 
the black women are better sprinters, better

00:29.107 --> 00:49.552
jumpers, better runners, of course, distance 
events, they're lacking in that area. But you can

00:49.572 --> 00:53.658
look at my team picture in a minute, and there 
weren't very many white girls on the team. They

00:53.678 --> 00:56.481
seem to just kind of, they've taken over all the 
events, and I don't really know why, because you go

00:53.678 --> 00:56.481
to You see the German teams, the Russian teams, who 
are beating our teams that are all black. Their

01:06.955 --> 01:12.922
teams are all white. Now, I know drugs enter a 
little bit there, but I'm not so naive to think that

01:12.942 --> 01:23.113
our women are probably not on drugs too, probably 
not as heavily as they are, and not all the girls.

01:23.133 --> 01:24.755
But I don't understand that. I think the black 
women athletes are going to be an incentive to the

01:24.775 --> 01:26.417
younger black

01:30.751 --> 01:46.062
And

01:30.751 --> 01:46.062
I always tried to pick out, like, Evelyn Ashford is 
our best American Sprinter. I would put her poster

01:46.082 --> 01:47.665
in the locker room and talk about her and Wilma 
Rudolph. And I think that inspires those kids,

01:47.685 --> 01:48.827
those younger ones.

01:56.232 --> 02:06.569
With the increased money being spent on women's 
athletics, do you feel the recruitment of women

01:56.232 --> 02:06.569
athletes

01:56.232 --> 02:06.569
will become more intense? I think it will. I don't 
think it will ever be. Well, it may be. But it will be

02:15.825 --> 02:18.409
a while before it's as bad as men's recruiting 
problems that we have. knowing some of the coaches

02:20.077 --> 02:24.441
that I've known that had to do some recruiting. 
It's tough, especially when that money comes in,

02:24.461 --> 02:29.927
because those girls will go anywhere. You know, 
really easy when there was one school with a little

02:30.107 --> 02:34.672
bit of money or everybody was pretty equal. The 
problem is you've got major colleges with a lot of

02:34.692 --> 02:46.003
money and some minor colleges that have stronger 
women's programs than what the major college

02:34.692 --> 02:46.003
does. They don't have so much money. And that's a 
real problem for them. That's not real equal. And

02:51.032 --> 02:59.827
so it's going to come down to, it's not right now, 
but I think it probably will end up who's going to

02:51.032 --> 02:59.827
give her most money. I hear a lot of girls now, it's 
funny to hear them say, well, maybe I'll get a car,

02:59.847 --> 03:07.380
maybe I'll get a business, maybe I'll get some 
extra money here. You know, they're thinking,

03:07.934 --> 03:17.892
they've seen the men get it, and they think they're 
going to get it now, you know. I didn't hear that

03:18.273 --> 03:26.047
when I was in school. Thought never crossed your 
mind. But now, I mean, if you're really good, you

03:27.810 --> 03:29.393
can hold out for a better deal. And women are 
getting to that point. I hope it doesn't happen,

03:30.154 --> 03:31.256
but I think it probably will. What was your... 
reaction of being the first woman inducted into

03:32.082 --> 03:46.041
the Texas A&M Hall of Fame? Do you feel there should 
be such an institution, Texas A&M? Yeah, I think

03:50.106 --> 03:51.668
it's good to have the Hall of Fame. I think it's good 
to have the Walker Student Association.

03:52.850 --> 03:54.612
Everybody kind of has their own area. I was in 
shock. when I got it. As a matter of fact, I'm on the

03:57.163 --> 04:07.637
board of directors of the Letterman's 
Association, and I know they do that every year,

03:57.163 --> 04:07.637
but I never expected it for myself. And it was 
almost like I thought, well, maybe I'm not worthy

04:07.657 --> 04:15.647
of it to be put up there with the meeting. I still 
feel that way. A lot of people told me I'm stupid for

04:17.430 --> 04:25.360
thinking that, because in their eyes, for what I 
did, it was just as good as what

04:29.187 --> 04:48.457
But it really

04:29.187 --> 04:48.457
surprised me, and I wasn't expecting it at all. But 
I'm real proud that I was chosen for it, and I'm real

04:48.477 --> 04:52.684
proud that I was the first, because I was also the 
first on the scholarship at A&M for an athletic

04:48.477 --> 04:52.684
program. I was the first female on a full athletic 
scholarship at A&M, so it kind of went step in step

04:52.704 --> 04:55.228
with that. My first reaction when the guy called me 
was, are you sure you have the right person? And he

05:01.454 --> 05:03.076
kept saying, well, I think so.

05:08.482 --> 05:11.906
Jackie Sherrill has made major changes 
concerning women's athletics. Since firing of

05:12.207 --> 05:18.214
Kay Dawn came under scrutiny, do you feel women's 
athletics at A&M will grow under Jackie Sherrill?

05:19.415 --> 05:22.819
Well, see that, first of all, Kay Dawn and I were 
married. And I loved her a lot. She supported me. In

05:31.254 --> 05:45.715
1980,

05:31.254 --> 05:45.715
she went around to all the Aggie clubs and got them 
to donate money so that I could travel. I ran under

05:45.735 --> 05:46.456
Texas A&M Track Club. And my money for my travel was 
all given to this former Aggies. She did a lot for

05:48.238 --> 05:48.659
me. I think she did a lot for me while she was here. My 
gosh, before she came, we didn't have anything.

05:50.681 --> 05:51.102
And... I knew

05:51.402 --> 06:15.150
when

05:51.402 --> 06:15.150
that happened, I don't really know the 
nitty-gritty of it all, but I know it was

05:51.402 --> 06:15.150
really bad. I like Lynn Hickey over there. I think 
she's going to do a good job. Sometimes I wonder how

06:16.552 --> 06:19.435
coaches like Jackie Sherrill, who are athletic 
directors, also coach and keep their mind equal

06:16.552 --> 06:19.435
for all sports. You know, it may be a better deal if 
you had someone like Kate Otten who wasn't the

06:19.853 --> 06:37.682
basketball coach or the track coach. Then again, 
on the other side of the coin, they, if you're a

06:37.702 --> 06:42.951
coach, you know what you need, you know, the wants 
and needs of your athletes, and hopefully you can

06:37.702 --> 06:42.951
see that in other sports, too. I think, I mean, I 
think you can't help but have the women's programs

06:43.011 --> 06:45.034
A&M. I

06:46.837 --> 07:06.624
don't think they

06:46.837 --> 07:06.624
were that bad. I think they were really growing for 
a while, and they kind of were in a slump, and I think

07:06.644 --> 07:10.330
that may be what happened there. I'm not real sure 
what Jackie Sherrill's done. I mean, I got a letter

07:11.291 --> 07:14.015
from him, which I thought was real nice, that he 
took the time to write me a letter, and I'm sure it

07:11.291 --> 07:14.015
worked well. I think if he's the kind of man that I 
think he is, he's going to want A&M. He's looking at

07:15.817 --> 07:16.438
it for A&M, not You're

07:18.781 --> 07:33.361
going to have to put your things in perspective. 
You want A&M to have good programs, not just the men

07:33.381 --> 07:39.749
to have good programs, but A&M as a whole. And 
athletics should be men's athletics and women's

07:39.769 --> 07:41.391
should be athletics and A&M. And we have both 
sexes, you know, but quite many opposites. So I

07:42.733 --> 07:44.756
think it's going to grow, and I think it will grow 
with him because I think he's smart. He's a smart

07:44.776 --> 07:45.717
person, and I think he knows that. And

07:46.743 --> 07:56.758
I think John David Crowe does too. It was real 
funny. Everybody kept apologizing to me at the

07:57.159 --> 07:59.166
press conference they called after I had received 
the award. And I was really

07:59.669 --> 08:19.517
kind of

07:59.669 --> 08:19.517
shocked that they were apologizing

07:59.669 --> 08:19.517
to me because I felt like they hadn't done enough 
for me for the accomplishments that I had gotten.

08:20.307 --> 08:23.911
you know, I never really felt that way. And then 
after that, I kept apologizing

08:23.932 --> 08:31.841
to him. Then I started thinking, well, you know,

08:31.861 --> 08:38.710
if I had been a man, I had a magazine. Of course, I 
wasn't a world record holder like Randy Manson.

08:41.013 --> 08:41.594
You know, I think he's, gosh. See, I still think of 
myself as not near as good as a man. I just, it

08:44.998 --> 08:50.044
really, I don't, you know, and I don't think I can go 
in there expecting the same things that Randy did.

08:57.483 --> 09:00.232
It was real funny that they kept apologizing to me. 
I kept wondering why they were apologizing to me.

09:04.566 --> 09:06.793
They just kept saying, we hadn't done enough for 
you. I just can't believe you did this. We never

09:07.756 --> 09:08.699
recognized you. We hadn't done enough. Which kind 
of makes you, then you go, well, yeah, maybe you

09:10.780 --> 09:15.106
guys recognize me enough. But I never have felt 
that way. I think I was dealt a good love,

09:17.670 --> 09:27.023
especially since they supported me after I had 
graduated. They had given me all the money. They

09:27.984 --> 09:29.025
took a lot of money to send me. Because all the meets 
that I competed in were pretty much on the West

09:29.145 --> 09:30.928
Coast. So every pentathlon meet I went to, it was 
like getting on a plane. It was like a major trip. So

09:36.736 --> 09:37.497
I feel good.

09:42.607 --> 09:57.031
What do you

09:42.607 --> 09:57.031
feel is the

09:42.607 --> 09:57.031
future of collegiate women's athletics? Well, I 
think they're going to really grow. I think

09:57.932 --> 09:59.936
they're going to start getting some publicity on 
television, which we're seeing more of now. More

09:59.956 --> 10:00.717
of the nationals being televised.

10:07.784 --> 10:21.991
too

10:07.784 --> 10:21.991
fast, and they don't keep rains on it like they're 
not going to. Because, well, this year in

10:22.011 --> 10:25.016
particular, it'll come as we know about the 
recruiting process they've had, and it can happen

10:22.011 --> 10:25.016
with the women's programs. So I think that With

10:26.161 --> 10:48.283
the growth rate

10:26.161 --> 10:48.283
that

10:26.161 --> 10:48.283
we're going to see, parents will be very careful 
and watch more closely. And publicity-wise, that

10:48.303 --> 10:50.526
will increase, which may also help the 
professional programs that we're talking about.

10:50.546 --> 10:52.388
It's like you can't start anything in college 
until you get your high school programs going. You

10:52.408 --> 10:53.869
can't do anything professional until you go to 
your college programs. So the one-on-one will

10:53.889 --> 10:54.750
prove the other one. This is the last question. Do 
you feel that women's athletics will ever be the

10:57.493 --> 11:03.763
same as men's athletics as far as funding? No. No, 
no. That's what we get for Eve getting Adam to add

11:05.365 --> 11:09.671
them. No, I don't. I think...

11:14.359 --> 11:19.647
I just don't think it ever will be. Maybe 50 years 
from now it might be, but in the very... near to, you

11:22.962 --> 11:36.633
know, 30

11:22.962 --> 11:36.633
years from now type future, I don't think that it 
will be. I don't know why. I think maybe one reason

11:37.014 --> 11:42.085
why is the men's programs, football is the biggest 
moneymaker, and women don't play football. And

11:43.617 --> 11:55.148
they're going to get the most publicity on 
television, professional, and NCAA. And even in

11:55.168 --> 11:56.549
high school they do. So men are going to always be 
caught because of football. And that's always

12:02.474 --> 12:04.096
going to be the biggest sport. Then you're going to 
want to win for men. I don't think they'll ever be

12:04.957 --> 12:06.198
equal. We'll be running close, but I don't think 
they'll ever be equal. And we may be equal in

12:08.460 --> 12:11.683
certain sports. But the

12:12.271 --> 12:33.058
bigger

12:12.271 --> 12:33.058
sports, basketball,

12:12.271 --> 12:33.058
women's basketball will never be equal to men's 
basketball. Track, they're pretty equal. I'm

12:33.659 --> 12:34.380
going to have to admit they are. Right now, they're 
under one coach. Smaller sports tend to be that

12:35.181 --> 12:35.882
way. Swimming, pretty equal. You see the Olympic 
swim meets, NCAA swim meets, usually they're all

12:36.383 --> 12:38.025
the same way. High

12:38.917 --> 12:54.624
schools now,

12:38.917 --> 12:54.624
in track, they're going, state meets are the same. 
They used to be separate. The girls' state was this

12:55.165 --> 12:57.028
weekend, the boys' was this weekend, now they're 
the same weekend. So you can see some improvements

12:57.048 --> 12:58.550
there, and it'll probably come around now. 
Nationals will probably end up being the same

12:58.570 --> 12:59.933
weekend, too. And the Nationals and the NCAA in 
track will probably be the same weekend.

13:06.710 --> 13:09.247
That's it. That's it.
