What is the current impact and what will be the 
future impact of the black women

00:05.960 --> 00:17.450
in athletics? They're strong. I

00:18.294 --> 00:23.094
can't understand. I wish I knew more about them. 
It's

00:24.620 --> 00:32.660
funny that in the United States, I'm talking about 
track now, the

00:32.640 --> 00:50.760
black women, distance events,

00:32.640 --> 00:50.760
they're lacking in there. They seem to just kind 
of... Why? Because you go to... You see the German

00:56.770 --> 01:01.790
teams, the Russian teams, who are beating our 
teams. Now, I know drugs are in there a little bit

01:01.770 --> 01:15.570
there, and not all the girls. I

01:15.550 --> 02:13.300
think

01:15.550 --> 02:13.300
it'll be a

01:15.550 --> 02:13.300
while before

01:15.550 --> 02:13.300
it's a

01:15.550 --> 02:13.300
thinking. They've

02:13.280 --> 03:10.500
seen

02:13.280 --> 03:10.500
the men get it,

02:13.280 --> 03:10.500
and

02:13.280 --> 03:10.500
they think they're

02:13.280 --> 03:10.500
going

02:13.280 --> 03:10.500
to

02:13.280 --> 03:10.500
get it.

03:10.480 --> 03:17.804
The thought never crossed their mind. The women 
are getting to that point. When

03:22.840 --> 03:51.350
is

03:22.840 --> 03:51.350
athletics

03:22.840 --> 03:51.350
at A&M?

03:58.452 --> 05:17.580
We'll

03:58.452 --> 05:17.580
throw

03:58.452 --> 05:17.580
in

03:58.452 --> 05:17.580
a

03:58.452 --> 05:17.580
check.

05:17.560 --> 05:43.230
Well, see that...

05:17.560 --> 05:43.230
First of all, Kay Donna and

05:17.560 --> 05:43.230
I were

05:17.560 --> 05:43.230
there. I think she did a lot for A&M. I knew when that 
happened...
