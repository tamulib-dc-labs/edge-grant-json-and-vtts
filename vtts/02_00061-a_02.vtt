WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:06.181
We turned the tape over about interviewing governors.

00:06.923 --> 00:09.648
First of all, did you ever deal with John Connolly?

00:10.350 --> 00:10.710
No.

00:10.811 --> 00:11.131
You didn't?

00:11.151 --> 00:11.853
No.

00:12.594 --> 00:17.484
Dolph Briscoe, I guess, was the first governor that I interviewed.

00:17.584 --> 00:21.853
Who was your favorite of all the governors?

00:21.833 --> 00:38.492
uh they were all good interviews and actually uh uh Dolph Brisco was the most friendly and and charming as far as putting me at ease and being welcoming of me and my cameraman

00:38.472 --> 00:45.101
and making time and giving plenty of time and in his personal office.

00:45.121 --> 00:57.038
The others were usually on site in conjunction to an event and probably didn't have as much control of the circumstances and giving as much time.

00:59.566 --> 01:10.768
I think probably it's because since I was young and learning as I went, it meant a lot to be befriended.

01:11.329 --> 01:16.680
And actually there was a lot of turmoil in the Bryan College Station community at the time.

01:16.660 --> 01:21.126
And a lot of rancor between city officials.

01:21.667 --> 01:24.090
And they would take it out on the reporters.

01:24.110 --> 01:29.397
And I would have them say they'd wring my neck or they'd slit my throat.

01:31.039 --> 01:33.001
You'd get some comments like that.

01:33.101 --> 01:35.164
Literally, did you as a reporter hear?

01:35.204 --> 01:36.085
Oh, yes.

01:36.165 --> 01:39.009
I was personally directed at me.

01:39.910 --> 01:41.733
But not at the state level.

01:41.773 --> 01:44.997
And at the time, we had...

01:44.977 --> 01:50.483
Bill Moore, you know, the bull of the Brazos as the senior state senator, and Bill Presnell.

01:50.503 --> 01:56.850
So Bryan College Station, Brazos County were, you know, hotbeds of political power.

01:56.910 --> 02:07.721
So it gave me the opportunity to interview some of the state level people, but then our own local officials were very well known.

02:07.801 --> 02:13.347
Let's zero in on Moore and Presnell because they were so important to A&M in the 70s.

02:13.327 --> 02:15.851
Describe your impressions of each of them.

02:18.315 --> 02:21.981
Well, I think, you know, their reputation preceded them.

02:22.041 --> 02:26.429
I didn't know them personally, and they lived up to their reputation.

02:26.509 --> 02:29.614
How did Bill Moore live up to Bull of the Brazos?

02:29.847 --> 02:38.282
Well, he was just very forthright, very outspoken, very assured of himself.

02:39.624 --> 02:47.198
I don't even remember the topic of the interviews right now and some of the issues, but he was very supportive of his family.

02:47.178 --> 02:56.912
And his son was up and coming as an attorney then at the time, and so they were just a force to be contended with.

02:56.932 --> 02:59.015
They're very strong in the community.

03:00.197 --> 03:05.825
And Presnell, I believe, was chair of the Appropriations Committee, if I recall correctly.

03:06.446 --> 03:11.093
So there was quite a bit of deference, you know, in the community to them both.

03:11.073 --> 03:17.353
and so I thought that you know

03:18.920 --> 03:30.256
despite the diplomacy that they had to be careful of, that they were always very forthright with us.

03:30.276 --> 03:48.741
Bill Moore had been in the Senate a long time, and when I was on the Aspirations Committee that recommended co-education and non-compulsory core and racial integration, he was a very potent, potent, potent supporter of all of those.

03:48.721 --> 03:54.649
And I suspect that if he had not been, we might not have had those.

03:55.110 --> 04:01.839
Now, I don't mean he was the only one, but if he had joined some of the other potent opponents, we might not have been.

04:02.340 --> 04:05.064
But he particularly was strong for coeducation.

04:06.546 --> 04:09.450
Well, there were different transitions taking place.

04:09.530 --> 04:17.040
You know, Olin Teague had passed, and there was an election that pitted Phil Graham.

04:19.703 --> 04:20.786
Oh, gosh, no.

04:20.826 --> 04:21.668
His name escapes me.

04:21.688 --> 04:23.352
He's in Waco.

04:23.632 --> 04:25.337
He's a congressman now.

04:25.377 --> 04:25.898
Chet Edwards.

04:25.918 --> 04:26.860
Chet Edwards, yes.

04:27.121 --> 04:28.965
Were you a reporter during that time?

04:28.985 --> 04:31.411
Yes, I interviewed Chet Edwards, Phil Graham.

04:31.471 --> 04:34.860
Share any recollection of that, because that's the Democratic primary.

04:35.381 --> 04:35.521
Right.

04:35.762 --> 04:37.105
And the...

04:37.355 --> 04:38.296
And there was someone else.

04:38.457 --> 04:46.367
Everyone knew that the TV weatherman from 4th Dallas would lead the first primary.

04:47.108 --> 04:50.333
So the big thing was to make the runoff.

04:50.353 --> 04:52.616
And so they were really running for second place.

04:52.636 --> 04:55.600
They knew he was going to lead, but that he probably couldn't win the runoff.

04:56.187 --> 05:00.793
Well, you know, this was just a trial by fire for me because it was very interesting.

05:00.853 --> 05:05.339
I realize now in hindsight what an interesting time, period of time that it was.

05:06.580 --> 05:10.025
But I didn't have the context and the background of knowing all of these people.

05:11.407 --> 05:12.889
But there was a runoff.

05:13.529 --> 05:15.692
Chet Edwards did not make the runoff.

05:16.193 --> 05:17.575
He was very young.

05:17.595 --> 05:18.996
He was a bachelor.

05:19.057 --> 05:21.700
Less than 150 votes.

05:22.361 --> 05:23.843
He lost to Graham less than 150 votes.

05:23.863 --> 05:24.844
On the margin, right.

05:26.005 --> 05:27.426
No, he did make the runoff.

05:27.446 --> 05:27.827
That's right.

05:27.847 --> 05:30.169
The runoff was between Edwards and Graham, wasn't it?

05:30.189 --> 05:30.690
No, no.

05:30.710 --> 05:31.070
It wasn't.

05:31.210 --> 05:32.832
It was between Graham and the TV.

05:33.372 --> 05:35.915
And he barely didn't make the runoff.

05:35.935 --> 05:40.800
And then he went on to become a state representative before running for Congress again.

05:40.820 --> 05:42.081
That's right.

05:42.342 --> 05:48.788
And there was some politics at the time because I don't think the Teague family endorsed anyone in particular.

05:48.828 --> 05:51.591
And that was sought after.

05:51.571 --> 06:05.465
Graham was a professor still, I believe, but I interviewed not the weatherman, but Graham and Edwards, and they were both very dynamic.

06:06.086 --> 06:20.380
You know, I just have personal anecdotes about Graham, the kinds of things that form a personal opinion versus a professional, and Graham could be very testy, and he could very easily pick up the phone and complain.

06:20.360 --> 06:25.589
at the station to us, and there were a couple of incidents of that.

06:25.809 --> 06:38.470
So, you know, he's very competent, you know, in terms of a politician and the work that he does now, but there are some of those personal

06:40.660 --> 06:48.088
Things that taint a little bit when you feel like someone has been unduly irate.

06:48.628 --> 06:51.071
O.D.

06:51.111 --> 06:55.956
Butler was suing the school district.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.980
So that was something that was going on.

07:00.621 --> 07:05.706
As a property owner, he headed up a property owners association and he, of course, went on.

07:05.686 --> 07:10.718
to become a vice or associate chancellor for agriculture.

07:11.299 --> 07:18.556
And we used to call him Overdose Butler for OD because he was, you know, such a personality.

07:19.639 --> 07:22.345
There were a lot of interesting personalities.

07:22.460 --> 07:25.565
Let's see some questions about some A&M people.

07:27.808 --> 07:33.257
John Colas was the new Vice President for Student Services, I think we called it.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.563
Describe your impressions of him in those years.

07:38.965 --> 07:40.227
I don't recall.

07:40.268 --> 07:44.254
I don't believe I had any interaction or followed too much.

07:44.294 --> 07:50.323
I had, before they

07:50.624 --> 07:53.767
did away with a separate dean of women and dean of men.

07:53.827 --> 07:57.530
I'd had some interaction with the dean of women because I got in trouble.

07:58.712 --> 08:06.839
And so they called me and my roommate in and gave us a little talking to.

08:07.620 --> 08:08.881
Who was the dean of women then?

08:08.901 --> 08:10.783
No, I don't remember her name.

08:10.803 --> 08:12.004
I don't remember either.

08:12.064 --> 08:12.564
Oh, gosh.

08:12.725 --> 08:13.946
She had a name changed.

08:14.046 --> 08:17.509
Toby something.

08:19.447 --> 08:42.889
It seems to come to mind, and there was a name change at some point, but I believe she was the dean of women, and so she had to have her secretary call me at my apartment and make an appointment for me and my roommate to come in to see her for a little disciplinary action.

08:42.869 --> 08:44.291
We had split.

08:44.351 --> 08:45.372
I had been persuaded.

08:45.472 --> 08:59.811
I had purchased my own shuttle bus pass, and then I was persuaded to cut it in half and share it with my roommate so that we could each have a half sticking out of our book as we got on and off the shuttle.

08:59.931 --> 09:04.998
And one of the halves fell out with identifying information.

09:05.999 --> 09:08.963
And so we got called in on that.

09:10.204 --> 09:12.387
What kind of punishment did she threaten you with?

09:12.535 --> 09:23.509
Well, this was going on our records, and it wouldn't be on our records for a year as long as we were on good behavior, you know, for another year.

09:23.610 --> 09:31.059
So after a year elapsed, you know, my roommate couldn't have cared less and kind of forgotten, but I was quite nervous.

09:31.159 --> 09:37.648
I wanted to make sure that that had, in fact, been removed from my records, so I went in to pursue it.

09:38.455 --> 09:46.508
No one had any recollection of it and couldn't find any record of it, so it didn't look like they'd ever even made an entry, but I double-checked that.

09:46.657 --> 09:50.303
As you think back on it, do you think she handled it appropriately?

09:50.323 --> 09:52.486
Yes, you know, very much so.

09:52.526 --> 10:13.018
She could tell we didn't need too much of a talking, you know, and that there's, you don't get anything for free, and of course, then we had to buy new passes, you know, at mid-semester, and so she, yes, she was appropriately serious, but not, you know, overly intimidating, and we minded our P's and Q's.

10:13.268 --> 10:17.889
Let's zero in on Dr. Williams, because I particularly want to get your recollections.

10:18.954 --> 10:21.928
Do you remember your first impressions of President Williams?

10:24.828 --> 10:27.271
You know, just from afar.

10:28.112 --> 10:29.834
I knew that he was the president.

10:29.854 --> 10:31.997
You know, I would see him walking on campus.

10:33.299 --> 10:40.628
He was very approachable, very likable, and I felt very comfortable in being able to nod.

10:40.648 --> 10:49.899
I knew he didn't know who I was, and, you know, I could nod or speak or hello, and he was always meeting eyes, you know, on the campus.

10:49.939 --> 10:54.565
He didn't look like he was averting his gaze to hurry on.

10:54.545 --> 10:58.042
So I appreciated that.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.454
And then when I became a reporter,

11:02.003 --> 11:19.824
we would cover Board of Regents meetings and just sit in attendance but not actually have an individual interaction with him because there was a, Lane Stevenson served as the community liaison and he was actually on the city council if we had questions.

11:19.944 --> 11:30.677
So I was a little bit insulated as a reporter until he had a heart attack and I covered his transfer and treatment.

11:30.657 --> 11:36.203
Were you aware of what most of the student's nickname was for Dr. Williams?

11:36.243 --> 11:37.704
Smiling Jack, I do believe.

11:38.906 --> 11:40.227
Did you think it was appropriate?

11:40.247 --> 11:43.310
Yes, yes, you know, that's what you thought.

11:43.650 --> 11:44.692
You know, he was always smiling.

11:45.152 --> 11:47.134
I'm very biased over on him.

11:47.154 --> 11:52.460
I loved Jack Williams, and I don't use that word about many people outside my own family.

11:52.580 --> 11:55.703
He's one of the most marvelous people I've ever known.

11:55.683 --> 12:06.786
You mentioned to me before we turned on the tape that you had some interaction at the time of his illness.

12:07.467 --> 12:11.615
Were you aware before his heart attack that his health was declining?

12:11.996 --> 12:16.425
Were you as a reporter aware of any decline in his health?

12:16.456 --> 12:18.038
I do remember being aware.

12:18.058 --> 12:38.206
I don't remember how I had that awareness that as a reporter, in the capacity of a reporter, I don't believe because of any battalion coverage or awareness as a student, but something in the course of the newsroom where we had an awareness that he had a heart condition.

12:39.809 --> 12:42.312
But then we had a scanner.

12:43.540 --> 12:55.491
in the newsroom and someone had the news that he had had a heart attack and that an ambulance had been called to the president's home.

12:55.927 --> 13:02.075
That was late at night, I believe, or definitely after dark.

13:03.657 --> 13:09.504
And I was not involved in going out to his home.

13:10.806 --> 13:21.259
We did get, I did receive comments from the ambulance operator afterward, the ambulance driver who transported him.

13:21.239 --> 13:29.502
and the ambulance crew arrived and said that he was not being resuscitated.

13:30.826 --> 13:33.493
Another doctor

13:34.570 --> 13:45.103
had arrived and was on hand but was said not to be actively resuscitating Dr. Williams at the time that it seemed that he had died.

13:46.544 --> 13:57.017
But the ambulance crew, as a matter of course, started resuscitation and apparently managed to revive Dr. Williams or at the hospital.

13:57.487 --> 14:03.155
He was revived, and now I do not remember if the transfer occurred that very night.

14:04.017 --> 14:04.798
Possibly not.

14:04.838 --> 14:06.120
It might have been the next night.

14:06.140 --> 14:09.305
They might have held him for 24 hours, or maybe it was the same night.

14:10.727 --> 14:15.033
I remember the heart attack being at night, and I remember the helicopter transfer being at night.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.578
Possibly it was the same night.

14:20.902 --> 14:23.646
But I took up where I...

14:25.060 --> 14:30.427
joined the action, so to speak, was to take up a position at the hospital.

14:32.290 --> 14:36.355
And I was waiting for the arrival of the helicopter.

14:38.318 --> 14:39.059
The St.

14:39.099 --> 14:43.825
Joseph Hospital was at its current location on 29th Street.

14:44.446 --> 14:46.849
They had a small helicopter pad

14:47.504 --> 14:53.070
concrete pad, but it was not enhanced as it is now with lights.

14:54.231 --> 15:00.799
Now it's replaced by a modern pad, but it was a concrete pad with no lights.

15:02.340 --> 15:17.477
So the police and fire trucks, the vehicles were out there with their lights on, their flashing lights on to try and give a reference point for the helicopter pilot.

15:17.457 --> 15:27.539
The pilot was reputed not to have made a trip to college to Bryan before and was late.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.583
He did not arrive on time.

15:29.603 --> 15:31.266
They said he was circling.

15:31.968 --> 15:34.253
So the lights helped him pinpoint St.

15:34.293 --> 15:34.734
Joseph.

15:34.794 --> 15:36.698
He landed and then I waited.

15:36.678 --> 15:39.443
for Dr. Williams to be wheeled out.

15:42.128 --> 15:57.775
A nurse came out and told me that the family did not want any film footage, but I knew that that was my assignment, you know, that I'd better attempt to get some film footage, and so I did position myself

15:57.755 --> 16:16.422
in hopes of getting film footage and then as I as he was wheeled out nurses and Mrs. Williams were accompanying him and the nurses you know did

16:16.756 --> 16:19.600
try to position themselves to block my way.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.202
I did roll some footage.

16:21.242 --> 16:25.007
It was film at the time with just an attached spotlight.

16:26.249 --> 16:31.416
And I didn't get anything that really developed to be beyond, you know, show anything more than shadows.

16:32.177 --> 16:38.646
So I decided to give up that position and I walked on out to the helicopter pad.

16:39.672 --> 16:42.877
but felt intimidated about getting too close.

16:43.218 --> 16:54.778
I did turn on my spotlight and try a couple of angles for footage and then stopped really feeling like that was not working out.

16:56.080 --> 17:01.950
But apparently, even as far as I was, the light was helping.

17:03.466 --> 17:14.220
And so one of the attendants, someone came up and said, would I mind coming closer to the helicopter and turning the spotlight of my camera back on because that had been helpful.

17:15.201 --> 17:24.173
And it took quite a while to get Dr. Williams situated, to get the different IVs and lines.

17:24.313 --> 17:26.376
And it was very crowded, cramped.

17:26.396 --> 17:27.657
I was impressed by that.

17:28.118 --> 17:31.262
It was very dark in the cabin of the helicopter.

17:31.242 --> 17:48.547
And so I did approach and stand very close to use my spotlight and have someone call back to the TV station to send one of my coworkers with more batteries for the spotlight should the batteries fail on it.

17:49.728 --> 17:55.517
But we managed to get by with one battery pack by the time they had him ready to transfer.

17:56.238 --> 17:58.701
But I ended up standing right there at the...

17:59.120 --> 18:04.711
What would your recollection be of the approximate time the helicopter was on the ground?

18:05.953 --> 18:08.237
You know, I started to say 30 minutes.

18:09.479 --> 18:18.276
As far as the amount of time to transfer Dr. Williams into the helicopter and to stabilize

18:18.374 --> 18:21.939
the connections and the monitors for his transfer.

18:23.501 --> 18:34.355
There was quite a bit of time waiting for the helicopter, and then after it landed, before they brought Dr. Williams out, but actually having him in the helicopter seemed a good 30 minutes.

18:34.435 --> 18:35.456
I can't be sure of that.

18:35.997 --> 18:40.022
As far as you were aware, was he conscious at the time?

18:40.082 --> 18:42.706
It didn't seem to me that he was.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.850
Now, Williams have two daughters.

18:46.353 --> 18:48.335
One about your age and one younger.

18:48.435 --> 18:51.299
Did you by chance encounter either of them there?

18:51.559 --> 18:53.281
I don't recall that they were there.

18:53.862 --> 19:08.378
I definitely recall Mrs. Williams, and she did emanate what I might have perceived as hostility, but also she would obviously have been very nervous and very concerned.

19:08.358 --> 19:11.966
But she did have a strong sense of privacy.

19:12.086 --> 19:20.125
She did not handle any of our follow-up calls, inquiring about his condition, asking for comments from the family.

19:20.145 --> 19:25.978
And it was not until after he was back in College Station on the job at A&M

19:26.701 --> 19:41.335
that we were on record with a standing request to speak to him and interview him, and he personally called and invited Channel 3 to interview him.

19:41.375 --> 19:47.281
And I don't recall now if he specifically asked me or if I just happened to, for me, or if I happened to get the assignment.

19:48.882 --> 19:51.104
For some reason or another, I think he asked for me.

19:51.385 --> 19:54.868
I don't know if he had an awareness that I was the one that had covered

19:55.135 --> 19:57.071
Oh, summarize that.

19:57.192 --> 19:58.282
The departure.

19:58.846 --> 20:00.117
Please summarize that.

20:00.434 --> 20:01.776
Well, we just interviewed him.

20:01.956 --> 20:03.337
About what?

20:04.258 --> 20:08.984
He wanted to thank the community for their prayers and good wishes.

20:10.746 --> 20:12.147
He thanked his family.

20:12.187 --> 20:27.505
He thanked us for giving him the opportunity to express this to the community, and he was just very warm and very assuring that he felt well and was back on the job

20:28.244 --> 20:37.012
doing the full job and just very reassuring.

20:38.276 --> 20:39.942
Did he by chance show you his scar?

20:40.524 --> 20:41.848
No, no.

20:41.913 --> 20:51.645
When my wife and I were first invited back to their house, just the two of us one night for supper, we hadn't been in more than five minutes when he said, would you like to see the damage?

20:52.206 --> 21:02.579
And he unbuttoned his shirt, and here was a scar that looked to me like it was from his neck down almost to his navel, just as if the whole chest had been opened up.

21:02.860 --> 21:06.925
He had a personal way of remembering who did what.

21:07.411 --> 21:11.517
And so that's just speculation.

21:11.577 --> 21:18.967
I'm surmising that he might have remembered I was involved in the coverage of his heart attack and what ensued.

21:19.007 --> 21:29.942
And so then I personally was glad to be able to wrap the story, so to speak, and interview him when he returned.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.936
Let's see, you were a junior at this time academically.

21:36.136 --> 21:39.461
This is your third year at A&M, 75, 76.

21:39.541 --> 21:41.784
Did he have his heart attack in 77?

21:42.025 --> 21:47.672
I started working my sophomore year in 76, so it had to be between 76 and 78.

21:48.173 --> 21:53.280
Well, he has the heart attack in the spring of 76.

21:53.986 --> 21:56.753
because the centennial year is obscured.

21:57.294 --> 22:00.501
I was still fairly new on the job then.

22:00.842 --> 22:02.566
That was my sophomore year.

22:02.586 --> 22:05.934
He's back either late that summer or early that fall.

22:06.756 --> 22:11.387
That was one of my early experiences then.

22:12.312 --> 22:19.782
which actually begins to ring true because by the time I left, I had a pretty thick skin.

22:20.804 --> 22:31.418
But I do remember being more sensitive because after he was transported, I wrote a story.

22:33.592 --> 22:41.402
Grew eventually to deliver all my stories, but at this time I wrote the story for the anchor, and he delivered the story.

22:41.422 --> 22:55.060
He read the story, but I did a script reporting on the transfer, but then commenting, editorializing that

22:57.368 --> 23:03.961
that the hospital or the community ought to do whatever was necessary to equip the helicopter pad with lights.

23:04.642 --> 23:13.740
What would happen if it were just you or me having to be transferred at night and not having a reporter available with a spotlight?

23:14.277 --> 23:17.402
to shine on the location.

23:18.003 --> 23:20.687
So I did add some editorial comments.

23:20.887 --> 23:30.402
And the Lions Club, I believe it was the College Station Lions Club, had been involved in the fundraising to have a helicopter pad installed at St.

23:30.442 --> 23:30.842
Joseph.

23:31.063 --> 23:32.505
It was a donation.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.811
And they and St.

23:34.831 --> 23:43.342
Joseph Hospital officials took great offense as though there had been negligence on their part.

23:44.343 --> 24:00.805
And I explained to them in person, because they presented themselves in person to complain, that I did not mean to infer negligence on their part, but that it was not a finished job, that something needed to be done as urgently

24:00.785 --> 24:07.695
as quickly as possible so that everyone would have the benefit of a safe night transfer.

24:10.159 --> 24:13.364
Did you have any interaction later with Mrs. Williams?

24:13.825 --> 24:16.549
No.

24:16.649 --> 24:18.351
Just Dr. Williams.

24:19.133 --> 24:29.408
And after that thank you session, were there other encounters with him that you remember?

24:30.097 --> 24:30.558
No.

24:31.119 --> 24:39.493
I looked through my files, and I happened to save some of my old scripts from Channel 3.

24:39.533 --> 24:40.434
Not all of them.

24:40.755 --> 24:47.987
I think at the time I saved the ones that had most to do with city and school district news for the record.

24:48.980 --> 24:50.862
I mentioned some of the turmoil.

24:51.623 --> 24:58.831
Well, the students were involved from Texas A&M in fighting the City of College Station.

25:00.172 --> 25:06.499
And so I think that Dr. Williams stayed out of that.

25:07.460 --> 25:16.029
And so some of my other Texas A&M coverage had to do with the student body and not Dr. Williams.

25:16.529 --> 25:17.991
The controversy

25:17.971 --> 25:38.522
had to do with a ward system for elections and the students had been instrumental in supporting award sections so that they could have a student vote, that otherwise their vote was diluted in at-large elections and they would have difficulty in getting a student on the city council.

25:40.365 --> 25:47.235
Somehow or another, I didn't get in on the very beginning of the story, there was an election, a charter

25:47.806 --> 25:55.641
revision election, the ward system passed, which was good news to the students.

25:56.522 --> 26:03.756
But the city council did not support and had hoped that it would not pass

26:05.272 --> 26:13.064
Shortly after the election, they found grounds to contest the election.

26:14.847 --> 26:22.259
And the students filed a restraining order against the city to prevent them from contesting.

26:23.260 --> 26:32.815
It did go on to be contested, but it required some kind of hearing and the city lost its case.

26:32.795 --> 26:45.327
because of the student involvement on that and so they had to wait the full legal mandate of two years before an election can be revisited.

26:47.189 --> 27:00.321
So a full two years after the original election, a second election was held and at that time the ward system failed and the at-large system was reinstituted.

27:00.301 --> 27:08.391
So for a two-year period, the students, you know, were very active in city issues.

27:10.393 --> 27:15.239
And so I pulled some of those stories to have reference to that.

27:15.739 --> 27:22.508
But you know what, I just collectively referred to students and didn't have a name of a specific student.

27:23.409 --> 27:28.755
Who were the key student leaders that you recall during your undergraduate years?

27:29.950 --> 27:34.595
You know, the names have, I've lost them over time.

27:34.795 --> 27:45.187
I remember the atmosphere of elections and all of the election signs and posters, but Fred McClure is the one name that I recall.

27:45.307 --> 27:47.289
Describe Fred McClure as a student leader.

27:48.690 --> 27:50.192
You know, very charismatic.

27:50.733 --> 27:53.916
I happen to know people

27:54.436 --> 28:01.072
at the time who knew him because of his involvement in the Future Farmers of America.

28:02.375 --> 28:09.492
And they had known him personally and spoke highly of him and always felt

28:09.472 --> 28:11.816
just charmed, you know, that he never forgot them.

28:12.557 --> 28:27.904
When he became student body president and obviously looked destined for a bright future, they always enjoyed that he remembered their names and would speak to them and didn't forget his FFA roots.

28:28.945 --> 28:34.635
And he was just an outstanding spokesperson.

28:35.122 --> 28:43.091
For you and your fellow students, did it matter at all that he was African-American in terms of what your impression of him?

28:45.453 --> 29:02.091
No, and, you know, I know that these prejudices exist, and there were a lot of things that existed in my time at college, whether it was prejudice or drugs or whatever, and I had the good fortune

29:02.932 --> 29:08.598
to not run across them, but I think that that could not have been too unusual.

29:08.978 --> 29:17.187
You know, I think if it had been prevalent, you know, that at some point in time, you know, I would have heard or been aware of that.

29:17.707 --> 29:27.698
Like when I first became acquainted with Fred, I think he was a freshman, and I was stunned to learn that he was Republican in his party favoritism.

29:28.098 --> 29:30.120
And I asked him, why wasn't he a Democrat?

29:30.455 --> 29:36.091
He quickly squeezed a little bit of his skin on the back of his hand, and he said, look at that, and I did.

29:36.151 --> 29:37.254
What about that?

29:37.816 --> 29:41.466
And he said, that's a rare commodity in the Republican Party.

29:41.486 --> 29:44.835
And he said, when the Republicans win, I'm going to be in high demand.

29:45.337 --> 29:45.477
Oh, no.

29:45.457 --> 30:04.477
Well, as we are speaking today in early 19, the year 2000, there is a rumor circulating very, very far underneath the surface that if George W. Bush is the new president of the United States, Fred McClure may be his chief of staff, which would be good for all of us.

30:06.459 --> 30:11.804
Did you, as a reporter, did you have much interaction with the student leadership on campus?

30:11.844 --> 30:13.506
Did you cover them very often?

30:14.245 --> 30:18.710
No, we didn't cover the Student Senate or anything like that.

30:20.853 --> 30:28.562
Usually our coverage of A&M was with the Board of Regents or special events, you know, doing a story at Bonfire.

30:28.783 --> 30:38.194
And the Bonfire was in the news, and the City Council was trying to have it moved, and that was always a perennial

30:38.174 --> 30:44.644
College Station request was to have it moved to a different site.

30:44.664 --> 30:50.272
That's when it was on the other side of the Duncan Dining Hall.

30:50.853 --> 30:56.060
And the embers would disperse over the residential area there.

30:56.481 --> 30:59.966
Did you go to Bonfire each year, you think, as a student?

31:00.627 --> 31:01.328
Probably.

31:01.528 --> 31:02.971
Did you work on Bonfire at all?

31:03.171 --> 31:03.892
No, I did not.

31:04.092 --> 31:06.195
Did any of your female friends?

31:06.235 --> 31:06.696
No.

31:07.047 --> 31:13.210
They baked cookies, but there was not a hands-on involvement.

31:14.294 --> 31:18.188
Did you think of bonfire being at all dangerous when you were a student?
