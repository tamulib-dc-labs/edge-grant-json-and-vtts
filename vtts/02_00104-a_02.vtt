WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:09.548
at night, most of the time no preaching.

00:09.568 --> 00:17.642
Alright, so when you came to the campus, you had no 
free time really. That's right. Unless you had a

00:18.583 --> 00:20.326
one hour break.

00:23.051 --> 00:29.802
That first semester, did you go to some of the 
campus activities? Like Yale practice? No. Did

00:34.390 --> 00:35.532
you go to football games? Some of them. Didn't have 
enough money to go to very many of them. Describe a

00:40.840 --> 00:43.865
football day, a football Saturday here. What time 
would you come to the campus? Well, I'd just stay

00:48.352 --> 00:52.718
because we stayed at school until noon. So we'd 
just stay over. If my riders could find some way to

00:55.242 --> 00:59.569
get home, I'd just stay over. So I wouldn't have to 
come back. Now would you wear your dress uniform to

01:02.116 --> 01:07.224
class that morning or would you change clothes? 
No, we just wore the uniform and wore it to the ball

01:08.566 --> 01:12.312
game. And did the Corps march in in those days or 
just go straight to your seats in the game? Oh, I

01:19.162 --> 01:20.223
think they marched in. They marched in. But the 
fact that I was not in the dormitory, I usually just

01:23.208 --> 01:29.337
went as a casual. I didn't march into any of the 
football games at that time. Now let's see, the

01:33.693 --> 01:37.879
head coach, was Coach Norton here then? He was 
there. The first, well I guess maybe for the whole

01:39.181 --> 01:45.711
time I was there. Haskell, I think he was. So you 
didn't eat much in the, in Sevesa? Were the new core

01:55.017 --> 01:58.621
dorms being built yet? They were started about my 
junior year, I guess it was, because our civil

01:58.641 --> 02:06.771
engineer classes went over a number of times. That 
was an inspection trip, you know, to watch the

02:07.312 --> 02:11.857
dormitory being built. Now, what was out there 
before? What was on that piece of ground before

02:13.760 --> 02:16.122
they were built? Nothing. It was just vacant. Was 
it used as a playground? Oh, I think it was part of

02:21.737 --> 02:25.743
the pasture. Part of the people that had the, you 
know, part of the departments that had horses and

02:26.123 --> 02:34.715
cows and this sort of thing. I think it was. Now, 
between what is now the core area and the Welborn

02:36.317 --> 02:43.266
Road, there were lots of faculty houses, weren't 
there? That's right. On the campus? Many of them.

02:50.755 --> 03:00.472
And then at one,

02:50.755 --> 03:00.472
oh from the middle 30s on, the old big project 
houses were in there. You know about those deals.

03:03.397 --> 03:07.043
What did you and your buddies think about those 
project houses? Well, you know, I didn't have any

03:07.360 --> 03:12.811
adverse feeling toward them. It looked to me like 
there was an excellent way for those boys to stay in

03:12.851 --> 03:21.107
school, and it was. That was a project of Mr. Dan 
Russell's. He had that idea, and it was a super

03:25.757 --> 03:28.542
thing. And the most dedicated Aggie former 
students that I know are the Project House

03:29.062 --> 03:35.773
graduates. They're the ones most proud, most 
grateful. Well, you know, they could bring stuff

03:38.177 --> 03:46.591
from home to play part of their board and room. Of 
course, that was the idea of it. Now, what was your

03:48.835 --> 03:52.301
routine for class? Did you go to class every day? 
And did you sit in a certain place up front or in the

03:56.163 --> 04:00.915
back? I liked to sit up front. I found out they 
didn't ask me so many questions when I sat up front.

04:08.971 --> 04:13.317
Because the guys that were looking to get away from 
the questions always sat in the back. And it was

04:13.337 --> 04:15.721
harder to go to sleep in the front, wasn't it? Well, 
it was. And Haskell, I was interested in going to

04:17.884 --> 04:21.148
school. I wasn't interested in any horseplay and 
try to irritate the professors and this or that.

04:28.819 --> 04:31.283
Some of them gave them a bad time. But

04:32.056 --> 04:38.202
to answer your question, we had special seats we 
sat in. And

04:38.783 --> 04:45.749
did you talk to the teachers much? Did you go up 
after class? Not a whole lot. So you didn't go up and

04:50.454 --> 04:53.437
introduce yourself or anything like that? Well, 
they all took place when you started. You tried to

04:59.545 --> 05:01.588
make him know who you were. What did you do to stay 
awake? Because occasionally you must have gotten

05:05.192 --> 05:07.015
sleepy. I don't remember that being a big problem. 
The only problem that I remember it was was in the

05:11.300 --> 05:21.914
chemistry lecture hall where there was about 300, 
and it was done by Mr. Harrington, I believe. M.T.

05:22.555 --> 05:23.156
Harrington. M.T. Harrington. The best lecturer 
that there ever was in the world. Describe him.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.342
Make believe I had never met him. Well, he was tall 
and stately, and when he talked, he talked like

05:34.085 --> 05:40.176
this. You could understand every word he said, all 
over the thing. And he was so articulate and

05:46.748 --> 05:54.662
so...things

05:46.748 --> 05:54.662
were... unraveled so smoothly the way he talked. 
He always talked to you. He didn't turn around and

06:01.678 --> 06:05.401
talk to the board and all this sort of thing. Did he 
give the impression that he was proud to be a

06:06.102 --> 06:09.785
teacher? He did. Did he relate well to the 
students? He sure did. I believe that he was as

06:16.151 --> 06:22.316
universally liked as anybody that I had in the 
whole system. Did he have a nickname? I've never

06:25.861 --> 06:27.504
heard a nickname for him. I don't remember one if 
you did. When you got your grades that first

06:31.169 --> 06:34.174
semester, do you remember how you did? In 
chemistry? No, the whole semester. Oh, I did art

06:38.141 --> 06:41.526
except on chemistry. I don't think I made any A's. I 
made a good many B's and two or three C's. I made one D

06:48.818 --> 06:52.223
as I remember in English I think it was. So I passed 
and that was, you know, I wasn't trying to be

06:53.165 --> 06:59.714
valedictorian or anything. I was interested in 
getting through school. During the day, if you

07:02.898 --> 07:12.151
wanted to go get a snack or anything or just take a 
break, where did you and your buddies go during the

07:02.898 --> 07:12.151
class day? I don't remember doing that. So you 
didn't go over to the YMCA or anything? No. Not me.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.869
First place didn't have any money for it. I didn't 
have any spending money, Haskell. And so you

07:28.955 --> 07:34.261
weren't involved in any jokes or pranks? Not 
really. A good bull? No. I'm sure I missed some of

07:38.605 --> 07:49.277
that, but, you know, I was there to get my education 
and thought I was fortunate to be able to. All

07:50.928 --> 07:51.288
right. Did you go on a court trip? No. I went on one my 
senior year. I went to Fort Worth. And the only

08:01.021 --> 08:05.226
reason I did, because I had an aunt that lived in 
Fort Worth, I could spend the night with her. How

08:05.727 --> 08:06.648
did you get up there?

08:10.773 --> 08:12.235
Must have gone in my old car. I can't remember. No, I 
tell you, my senior year my dad traded that car off

08:16.274 --> 08:28.371
for a better Plymouth, and I think I went in that 
Plymouth because I didn't go on a court trip except

08:16.274 --> 08:28.371
in my senior year. Did you take a load of guys with 
you? No. I took down my fiancée. She was one of my

08:36.001 --> 08:37.503
riders, too. She and I started first grade 
together. Oh, really? Yeah. And what was she doing

08:43.139 --> 08:46.244
on the campus? She was a secretary at the extension 
service. Okay. She was a secretary to three

08:51.532 --> 08:57.041
ladies, three of those extension specialists. 
And where were their offices? What building? It's

08:59.945 --> 09:01.648
what's the trigon now. Okay. That was the 
extension service. Describe what was around the

09:04.492 --> 09:11.323
campus then, what areas were developed. Well, 
Guyon Hall was there at that time. Yes. Hart Hall

09:16.118 --> 09:19.224
was there. Mitchell Hall was there. The trees were 
rather small, I guess. Yes. They had been planted

09:26.558 --> 09:30.365
some four or five years, most of them. Railroad 
Station was a busy place. It was.

09:37.375 --> 09:41.402
And like you said, there were a lot of the 
residences on there. Let me think. But at

09:44.827 --> 09:46.811
Northgate, what was at Northgate? Oh, there 
weren't but two or three things there. Hollick

09:50.356 --> 09:51.779
Boot Shop was one. Hollick made my boots. Was Old 
Army Lou, he was in business already? Yes. Was the

09:58.710 --> 10:00.413
campus theater open yet? I think it opened, if I'm 
not mistaken, while I was there. And then there was

10:05.438 --> 10:14.809
a drive-in back there, you know, the open-air 
drive-in, where all those buildings and the

10:05.438 --> 10:14.809
high-rises and things are now. Seemed to me like 
that's where that thing was. But there weren't

10:17.432 --> 10:23.059
many houses on Southside and east of Texas Avenue, 
were there? East of Texas? No, not many. There was a

10:27.987 --> 10:32.914
first court that was in Bryan was over there and 
it's called Bluetop Court. You ever hear of that?

10:35.778 --> 10:36.780
You're talking about Tourist Court? Tourist 
Court. What it was, it was an office and then each

10:38.322 --> 10:50.580
little cabin, and I don't know how many people, I 
guess one person would rent the cabin, and they all

10:38.322 --> 10:50.580
had blue roofs and they called it the Bluetop 
Court. About where was that? Well, it was about

10:52.655 --> 11:06.111
where, in the area where that shopping center is 
and the red, what's the fish place, red something?

11:06.651 --> 11:08.493
Oh, Red Lobster. Red Lobster. Okay. In that area. 
Of course, none of that was there. And when you

11:14.941 --> 11:20.147
started from Bryan to college, You know where R.B. 
Butler's construction office was? And the big old

11:26.179 --> 11:34.071
two-story house that was the doctor's office, 
it's now a

11:26.179 --> 11:34.071
fraternity. That was the last thing there was 
until you got out to where the Ramada Inn is now.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.869
Nothing was in there pasturing. And where 
University goes east, there was a grocery store

11:46.132 --> 11:52.720
right on the corner there called Macy's Grocery. 
There wasn't anything on the other side. And the

11:56.544 --> 12:02.432
University from there through the campus hadn't 
been built but a few years. It was just a single

12:02.492 --> 12:05.495
concrete road. What was the name of that street? It 
wasn't University then. What was it named?

12:14.870 --> 12:15.812
I can't remember. I'm trying to recall what it was. 
I didn't tell you. Now the streetcar, was it still

12:20.640 --> 12:23.284
operating? No. It had stopped? Yeah. So that, was 
there a bus? Was there a city bus that went from? No.

12:36.858 --> 12:44.548
When I first remember, I ask them,

12:36.858 --> 12:44.548
Main Street of Bryan was Houston Highway. It went 
straight on out and went down what's now,

12:46.571 --> 12:56.584
what do they call that street? William J. Bryan? 
No, over on the east side, I mean west side. where

13:03.773 --> 13:08.261
Main goes on out. That's the way the Houston 
Highway went and got to where the Farmer's Market

13:08.281 --> 13:18.558
is and it turned and went back to the railroad and 
went right down the railroad. Wellborn was on the

13:19.139 --> 13:21.202
way to the Houston Highway. And the depot, the 
railroad depot was right down in the middle of

13:21.964 --> 13:30.017
Bryan near the old courthouse. Wasn't the depot 
down there? You're talking about the Bryan Depot?

13:35.178 --> 13:35.318
Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, it was

13:36.299 --> 13:44.649
just about where the Children's Museum is now. 
Yeah, yeah. Right along in there. Now, how often

13:48.114 --> 13:53.360
did your family come to Bryan to buy groceries or 
anything? Well, not regularly, but... Once a

13:54.342 --> 13:57.065
month? Probably not over average of once a month. 
My daddy had what he called a commissary to furnish

14:00.710 --> 14:07.179
the sharecroppers. They would buy groceries and 
stuff and then pay them in the fall when they got

14:08.401 --> 14:15.551
their money in. So a lot of the groceries that we had 
were bought that way. We bought them out had beans

14:21.263 --> 14:25.431
and sugar and rice and coffee and this sort of 
thing. And he'd come to Brian to the wholesale

14:26.072 --> 14:32.503
place and get those and then furnish his 
sharecroppers with that. Did your mother and

14:32.563 --> 14:35.869
other women do a lot of canning and preserving? Oh, 
yes, sir. We even canned beef. My daddy would kill a

14:39.676 --> 14:41.179
beef. and Mother would process it and we'd put it in 
tin cans and had a sealer for those cans, seal them

14:41.716 --> 14:53.273
and then put them in a pressure cooker and cook them 
and those things would last from then on. Now was

14:53.293 --> 14:54.936
there a gin in Wheelock? And then where did the corn 
get processed? They had a mill in Wheelock that

14:59.462 --> 15:05.952
ground the corn and he ground it for He took a toll 
out of it. Nobody paid him. Took a toll out of the

15:11.196 --> 15:12.398
corn. And it was a blacksmith shop and a corn mill. 
And he ground it as corn meal. That's right. Not

15:21.289 --> 15:21.830
flour. Corn meal. There was no flour made in 
Wheeler. Now did y'all eat grits ever? Not much.

15:31.057 --> 15:33.580
See, I didn't know grits existed when I was a little 
kid. Because that was something you had to buy.

15:35.182 --> 15:36.865
Yeah. We didn't need much that you had to buy.

15:42.132 --> 15:47.779
When your family were going to kind of celebrate, 
what did they do? Like did they ever take a

15:48.601 --> 15:50.123
vacation? No. Go fishing for fun or hunting for 
fun? Once a year, several of the Wheelock families

15:56.860 --> 16:02.768
would go what they called camping. Most of the time 
it was over on the Navasota River at one of the lakes

16:03.690 --> 16:09.778
and stayed two or three days. And the ladies would 
take all the food and the men would catch a few fish.

16:15.586 --> 16:17.929
But that was almost the vacations. And those lakes 
were pretty small, weren't they? Well, they were,

16:21.194 --> 16:25.500
but at the time I don't know whether they were on 
private property or what, but everybody would

16:25.480 --> 16:30.636
come in and camp on them. It didn't seem to make any 
difference. You didn't have to get any

16:33.184 --> 16:34.950
permission. All right. So while you're doing all 
these tasks, your freshman year went pretty well.

16:42.619 --> 16:44.741
And did you ever think about dropping out of 
school? No. Okay. Never. Then that first summer

16:48.025 --> 16:55.233
you worked part-time on the campus and took some 
extra courses. Yes. I liked those courses. They

16:58.397 --> 17:01.360
went in a hurry, you know, six weeks Then your 
sophomore year, was it very different from your

17:03.078 --> 17:06.563
freshman year? Yeah. You began to feel like you 
sort of belonged out there then, and then of course

17:08.306 --> 17:17.780
I think the course had got a little more difficult 
too. Did you have any special courses that you

17:18.722 --> 17:23.449
recall that sophomore year that were important to 
you? Well, it began to take a few things that were

17:24.509 --> 17:31.277
truly civil engineering. It took some structures 
and things that rather than the arithmetic and the

17:31.297 --> 17:43.010
chemistry and the physics and this sort of thing. 
Who were some of those engineering teachers that

17:43.110 --> 17:45.833
you remember? Cy Sandstedt was one. you know of 
him. C.E. Sanstead, I believe, is his name. Joe Orr

17:55.720 --> 17:57.082
was another one. Joe Orr taught surveying.

18:02.228 --> 18:03.510
What was special about them?

18:06.795 --> 18:13.804
Something special about Joe Orr, he'd take his 
surveying class out and do work, and I think he got

18:06.795 --> 18:13.804
paid for it. I don't have no way of knowing, but I bet 
he did. And then

18:17.873 --> 18:26.423
what was the head of... You said Sanstead. What 
about him? What was special about him? Oh, he was

18:30.248 --> 18:33.652
not a flashy... He was a sort of a reserved type 
teacher. He wasn't...

18:42.235 --> 18:45.761
Nothing really outstanding about him. He was a 
good teacher. Had the boys well at heart. But I was

18:50.669 --> 18:54.355
trying to think what the other teacher's name was. 
He's got a son who's a doctor here now. What's his

18:57.300 --> 18:57.941
name? C.E. Department.

19:03.390 --> 19:07.517
Doctor, doctor...

19:08.797 --> 19:14.025
He's over here on North Avenue, I believe it is. 
Doesn't ring a bell. Doesn't ring a bell. Who were

19:18.551 --> 19:19.713
your best buddies? Well, mostly the boys that I 
worked with on, you know, the student labor. Who?

19:34.632 --> 19:36.560
I had one little old boy from Brady. What was that 
little boy's name? I'd have to get an old manual out

19:41.641 --> 19:44.372
over there and think. I had another one that 
married a cousin of mine named

19:45.095 --> 19:57.237
Carter, Frank Carter, and incidentally he was 
with the Rudders Rangers that went in on D-Day. He

19:58.680 --> 20:02.466
was badly injured and has since passed away. In 
fact, I introduced him to his wife. He married my

20:07.976 --> 20:09.499
cousin. I was going to tell you a funny story, in 
fact, I thought this fellow's name that taught us

20:11.318 --> 20:20.688
part of our summer CE class. We were out south of the 
campus and we did triangulation and we shot

20:20.708 --> 20:40.110
Polaris at night, which is the star of what you 
orient on, you know, and we'd get in the truck and

20:20.708 --> 20:40.110
some of us have to go way across the pasture to do our 
work and Two or three of us would do the instrument

20:41.356 --> 20:45.224
work, and then the others would get up and they'd do 
it. And while we were doing it, they'd either sit in

20:45.264 --> 20:48.151
the shade or whatever. So this professor had told 
us, didn't want us laying around in the shade. And

20:54.839 --> 20:59.945
he didn't want them without shirts on because of 
the sun, you know. Well, one morning we went way off

20:59.965 --> 21:05.511
over there and one old boy named, boy and his name 
was Sharp. I remember that, Chico Sharp. He laid

21:09.055 --> 21:14.161
down on his stomach and his back was blistered from 
the sun. He didn't think the professor would be

21:14.742 --> 21:17.345
over there. And he carried a walking stick. Well, 
that particular morning he walked over there. And

21:25.298 --> 21:28.504
he took that stick and he rubbed it down Chico's 
back. And Chico thought it was some of us. And he

21:32.250 --> 21:38.782
said, you son of a bitch.

21:38.862 --> 21:39.062
McNew. McNew. That's his name. Lamar McNew's 
father. Lamar McNew. Yeah, yeah. And Magnus said,

21:45.633 --> 21:48.978
Chico, get up and put your shirt on. That's all he 
ever said at the time. But you said, Mom, some funny

21:52.302 --> 21:54.405
stories. Now that was a funny story. That's good. 
All right. With your sophomore year, did you have

21:59.492 --> 22:04.640
any grade troubles or did things get better from 
there on? I didn't have any problems sophomore

22:04.860 --> 22:06.682
year.

22:11.910 --> 22:14.914
Did you go to more football games your sophomore 
year? No, I just went to a bare number, you know. I'd

22:20.781 --> 22:24.806
usually work on Saturday afternoon if I had the 
opportunity. All right. Where would you and your

22:25.487 --> 22:30.153
date go if you had a date on Saturday night? Where 
did you all go? We'd come to Bryan, go to a show.

22:33.176 --> 22:35.839
Which, there were three downtown, three movies? 
There were two at that time, as I remember. Two?

22:37.421 --> 22:37.922
What were they? The Palace and The Queen. Do you 
remember any special movies that you all saw? I

22:44.780 --> 22:45.942
don't remember. There was also a drug store on the 
corner and you could park and honk your horn and

22:46.383 --> 22:52.995
they'd come out and wait on you, you know. And then 
there was a restaurant over on Bryan Street called

22:54.177 --> 22:59.186
Uncle Buck's. The name was Buchanan.

23:03.781 --> 23:16.330
If we didn't go to the drugstore, we'd go by there 
and get us a sandwich, and get a big old sandwich for

23:03.781 --> 23:16.330
25 cents, and that was our dead meal. And cut it in 
half? Yeah. At what time were you supposed to have

23:19.457 --> 23:22.043
her home? They didn't give me any time. I think I was 
pretty well trusted with that girl. Her father

23:31.369 --> 23:35.073
owned a store there in Wheelock. And did you all go 
to the same church? We did.

23:41.599 --> 23:45.864
Here on the campus, do you remember when you first 
went to Silver Taps? I sure don't. I didn't go to

23:49.408 --> 23:52.671
many, but I did And I think the first one I went to was 
my freshman year, and the reason I did, one of the

23:53.157 --> 24:09.260
boys died that I was a pretty good friend with, one 
of my C.E. buddies. He got,

24:10.723 --> 24:17.933
what is this, what's this?

24:21.541 --> 24:23.845
what the ailment was. It's this thing sort of like 
flu and

24:25.969 --> 24:37.710
where you die from congestion and all this. 
Pneumonia? No. It hit the campus right at

24:43.148 --> 24:46.471
Christmas. Oh, oh, oh. Influenza? Yeah. Some type 
of influenza. Anyhow, he died, and I had been up in

24:51.517 --> 24:56.983
his room studying at times. Scared the fool out of 
me, I'll tell you for sure. And I went to his silver

25:00.787 --> 25:05.352
taps, and I think that's the first thing I ever went 
to. Describe Silver Taps then compared to now in

25:06.479 --> 25:11.849
terms of how it was done. Was it the same way? Well, 
it was out in the area in front of the old

25:14.233 --> 25:25.674
administration building where Sully is, and they 
blew the taps from up on top of this administration

25:14.233 --> 25:25.674
building. That's where the bugler was. And 
everybody sat on the ground and that's where it

25:27.995 --> 25:35.262
took place. Did everybody take it seriously? Very 
seriously. Nobody played any? No, there wasn't

25:39.826 --> 25:42.228
any horseplay at all. It was very quiet and when it 
was over they left without talking and very

25:43.289 --> 25:49.716
solemn. What about Bonfire? Do you remember? Oh, I 
do. I do. Describe. It was a bunch of trash. That

25:58.403 --> 26:00.626
they gathered around the campus, didn't they? 
That's right. Gathered it up in the stores in boxes

26:01.047 --> 26:10.179
and barrels and it was over on what's now the drill 
field, the old, what do they call it? Just the drill

26:10.680 --> 26:11.481
field. Yeah. It's got a name though now. Oh, it's 
now named for the general. Yeah. Simpson.

26:18.190 --> 26:18.711
Simpson. That's where it was at that time. Did you 
ever help? No. No. Now, did they pick it up with the

26:24.822 --> 26:29.309
push carts from the railroad station? I've heard 
that. Yeah, or wagons or drug it, whatever. You

26:39.163 --> 26:41.747
know, I've got two of those old carts out at my 
place. Really? Two of those old railroad things.

26:44.090 --> 26:45.713
Oh my, how good, how good. All right, what about 
muster? Do you remember going to muster before

26:47.756 --> 26:50.820
World War II?

26:53.872 --> 26:56.796
I don't really remember much about muster. The 
first musters that I went to were after. I truly

27:03.004 --> 27:07.651
don't remember any musters, and I don't know 
whether they had them or not. Does anybody

27:08.572 --> 27:10.715
remember having muster? Nobody does. Just about 
like what you said, some of them say, I think they

27:13.218 --> 27:20.368
may have had one, but I'm not sure whether I went or 
not. And I'm convinced that World War II changed

27:20.787 --> 27:24.411
that in turn. I think it did. I went to the one where 
Eisenhower was the speaker right after the war. In

27:35.022 --> 27:37.264
fact, I've been to nearly every muster since the 
war. During your years, describe the student body

27:39.367 --> 27:47.595
in general, the students that were here. Where 
were they from? What kind of families?

27:53.795 --> 27:57.459
There was a lot of them from the farms and ranches.

28:02.144 --> 28:08.751
I think I would just class them as, you know, normal 
boys of the time. Some city boys, of course, and

28:09.292 --> 28:13.436
lots of farm boys. About how many students had a car 
then? Darn, none of them. Oh, there wasn't a

28:21.098 --> 28:24.415
sprinkling of cars. How many drove to the campus 
like you did? A dozen? A dozen? Well, I wouldn't

28:30.437 --> 28:40.145
even guess because most of the people that parked 
in that parking lot were professors or staff of

28:30.437 --> 28:40.145
some sort. And a bunch of them came from the project 
houses in buses or old trucks that had seats on

28:41.166 --> 28:51.415
them. And that's where they'd come and let the boys 
off and then back out. There was a sprinkling of day

28:56.620 --> 29:01.046
students that had cars. I mean students that had 
cars. But most everybody lived on campus. Oh,

29:05.912 --> 29:07.314
yeah. Well, there were a few off campuses, but not a 
lot of them. And in terms of family income, there

29:13.482 --> 29:20.291
were lots of poor boys, but a few from well-to-do 
families? There were. Were there any students in

29:21.733 --> 29:26.239
your day that you all knew were from rich families? 
Do you remember any of them? A few. Do you remember

29:28.281 --> 29:30.283
who they were by name? No.

29:34.107 --> 29:41.955
This boy that died came from a pretty well-off 
family, I remember that, from down in Pharr,

29:34.107 --> 29:41.955
Texas. That's where he was from. That's 
P-H-A-R-R. That's right. And in terms of their

29:47.060 --> 29:52.125
national background, there were German boys and 
Czech boys. But you know we didn't have a lot of

29:55.313 --> 29:58.958
these foreigners like we got now. We had what the 
United States had as foreigners, but none of the,

30:00.199 --> 30:10.913
gosh there wasn't any Japanese or Chinese to mount 
anything. Were there some Hispanic,

30:10.933 --> 30:13.397
American-Hispanic boys? There were, there were. 
And how was everybody treated, the students? I

30:22.615 --> 30:26.501
assume with much respect. Did it matter? Were you 
treated any special way because your father was a

30:28.905 --> 30:32.771
farmer? I doubt it. I doubt it. I think most of them 
were treated however they were able to place

30:39.041 --> 30:44.830
themselves in society. I remember Reveille. Oh, 
describe. I got a picture of her in my annual. I just

30:52.685 --> 30:53.907
saw it this morning. Because Reveley was new then, 
wasn't it? The little cur dog, yeah. In fact, I

30:58.334 --> 31:02.962
think she came there maybe either while I was there 
or just before. Describe that dog. Little fat cur

31:05.226 --> 31:08.812
dog about that long and about that big around. 
Little brownish-gray dog. And she just won.
