00:01.955 --> 00:16.576
This is an interview with John Ragland, Sr. by Mark 
McCall on April 29, 1993 at Westminster

00:01.955 --> 00:16.576
Presbyterian Church concerning the 
perspectives of the Civil Rights Movement during

00:01.955 --> 00:16.576
the 1960s. In the interest of accumulating 
knowledge, I'm asking you to donate this tape to me

00:16.596 --> 00:26.610
or to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection at the 
University Archives. Is that all right with you?

00:27.992 --> 00:29.734
Yes, it is.

00:31.705 --> 00:34.990
What is your current job and profession? I am a 
senior minister at Westminster Presbyterian

00:35.611 --> 00:41.040
Church in Bryan, Texas. And where were you born? I 
was born in Jacksonville, Florida. Do you want to

00:46.329 --> 00:48.532
know the date? Sure. That doesn't bother me. It was 
April 6, 1947. And where did you grow up? I grew up in

00:55.123 --> 00:57.747
the southeast. major cities in the southeast. 
Jacksonville, Florida, Daytona, Pensacola,

01:00.170 --> 01:10.880
Savannah, Atlanta, Georgia, Charlotte, North 
Carolina, Birmingham, Alabama, Jackson,

01:00.170 --> 01:10.880
Mississippi. When were you in high school? I was in 
high school from about 1961 to 1965. How did you

01:18.908 --> 01:24.374
perceive the situations in America toward 
minorities? Well, I was in high school in Atlanta,

01:24.394 --> 01:27.717
Georgia. And I lived in Atlanta two different 
times. I lived in Atlanta in the mid-50s when I was

01:35.868 --> 01:41.175
probably in the fourth grade. And then we came back 
in the early 60s when

01:41.195 --> 01:49.065
I was in the 10th grade. And so I guess it wasn't 61 or 
65. I guess it was really 62 to 65 is when I was really

02:01.278 --> 02:04.782
Well, 61, 65, anyway, something like that.

02:08.866 --> 02:12.930
Because I was there when Sean Kennedy was 
assassinated. When was that? Was that in 61 or 62?

02:14.091 --> 02:14.692
Right in there. Right, right. Well, I do remember 
in the mid-50s, I could go into the richest

02:16.414 --> 02:25.763
apartment store in downtown Atlanta. And I was 
getting ready to go in. Went down to the basement. I

02:28.366 --> 02:29.327
was going to go to the bathroom. And I really wasn't 
paying attention to what I was doing. And I started

02:33.171 --> 02:38.359
walking into this bathroom, and this policeman 
stopped me. And he said, you can't go in that

02:38.379 --> 02:40.201
bathroom. That bathroom is for, I guess he said, 
Negroes. And you need to go to this bathroom,

02:45.549 --> 02:50.677
because this is for whites. And I can also remember 
that there, in the bus station, there was a section

02:50.697 --> 02:59.550
for black people and there was a section for white 
people. I think in the high school years, I don't

03:00.155 --> 03:16.732
have any real recollections of any of that, one way 
or the other. It's just not in my mind. And our high

03:19.435 --> 03:24.660
school was not integrating any sense of the word 
when I was in high school. Why did you decide to go

03:26.530 --> 03:29.153
into the ministry? Well, I was headed for really a 
military career. I had enjoyed the ROTC program in

03:35.238 --> 03:43.166
high school immensely, and I thought I would 
really enjoy a military career. And then I became a

03:43.226 --> 03:56.419
Christian, came to know Christ as my personal 
Savior and Lord about the summer before my senior

03:43.226 --> 03:56.419
year. God began to change some of my motivations 
and really began to put within me a desire to pursue

03:56.652 --> 04:10.390
a full-time Christian vocational work such as 
ministry. I started moving in that direction.

04:16.345 --> 04:17.366
Where'd you go? Where'd you attend college, 
seminary? I went to Belhaven College, which is a

04:19.650 --> 04:27.881
four-year liberal arts college related to the 
Presbyterian Church. At that time, it was related

04:27.921 --> 04:38.336
to the Presbyterian Church in the United States, 
which was the old Southern Presbyterian Church.

04:38.356 --> 04:44.023
And then I went to seminary, Reformed Theological 
Seminary, also in Jackson, Mississippi. During

04:44.043 --> 04:45.205
what years? Okay, I was at Belle Haven from 1965 to 
1969, and I performed seminary from 1969 until

04:46.028 --> 05:05.977
1973, and I took a year out and served the church in 
Prattville,

04:46.028 --> 05:05.977
Alabama. Okay, can you describe Belle Haven 
during the 60s? What was it? Just some... Oral

05:13.754 --> 05:15.898
descriptions, I guess, of the school? Okay, well, 
Belhaven was not, there were no black students in

05:16.158 --> 05:23.650
Belhaven College until my senior year. And at that 
time, I think we had one student. She ended up, I

05:29.099 --> 05:30.802
think she ended up graduating. She must have 
transferred

05:30.822 --> 05:36.632
in. There, the college was a small school. And I 
think the college somewhat reflected the

05:41.311 --> 05:58.131
conflict over race relations,

05:41.311 --> 05:58.131
attitudes toward race relations in society in 
general. What I'm meaning by that is you had some

05:58.151 --> 06:05.800
people that really didn't agree with a prejudiced 
attitude toward black people whatsoever. Some

06:13.031 --> 06:21.404
were from missionary families, either from 
Africa or from Brazil. And they just didn't

06:21.424 --> 06:29.897
compute in their thinking to have that kind of 
attitude toward black people. Then you had some

06:30.282 --> 06:35.628
other people that were, that was what they were 
brought up with. That was their cultural

06:35.648 --> 06:39.392
perspective. So there was somewhat of a conflict 
during that, from about 1965 all the way to 69. In

06:47.321 --> 06:52.527
Belle Haven I remember that there were somewhat of 
a somewhat of a tension there among some of the

06:54.532 --> 06:58.757
students. And Belhaven itself went through a 
transition as they moved from a, I think they

06:58.777 --> 07:23.063
adopted a policy, debated it extensively, but 
they finally, I think the board adopted basically

06:58.777 --> 07:23.063
a policy of not discriminating on the basis of race 
or color. I think part of that was in with the

07:25.379 --> 07:30.447
getting federal money. And then there were some 
that didn't even want to be getting federal money.

07:33.572 --> 07:36.096
It didn't really have anything to do with the race 
at all. It was just a philosophy of receiving

07:36.156 --> 07:40.042
federal funds. So some of that debate was quite 
mixed. But some of it did deal with the issue of

07:44.108 --> 07:50.458
integration. Where did most of the students come 
from? I think most of the students really came from

07:54.910 --> 07:59.076
the South. Was it a close campus between the 
student to student? Oh, yeah. It was a very small

08:04.182 --> 08:06.645
campus. And between the faculty and the students? 
Yes, close relationship between faculty and

08:12.593 --> 08:16.818
students. Very good faculty-student ratio. 
Remember you telling how the faculty used to come

08:19.953 --> 08:26.501
or want some, there was a couple of guys that used to 
come around before finals. They kind of breezed in

08:28.063 --> 08:34.792
to kind of give a word of encouragement, which is 
really appreciated. That was in the Bible

08:34.832 --> 08:37.936
department primarily. I think they really had a 
pastoral concern for students.

08:45.765 --> 08:47.668
And was it co-ed at the time? Yep, it was co-ed. We 
already touched on this a little bit, but were

08:50.564 --> 08:54.408
there any black students? Not until my senior 
year.

09:03.959 --> 09:12.589
How did you feel about the black students or what 
you really, but black race during your freshman

09:03.959 --> 09:12.589
year?

09:15.843 --> 09:16.644
Well, I don't know. I think I was going through 
something of a transition. I think my freshman

09:20.388 --> 09:31.881
year, it was either my freshman year or my 
sophomore year, I sensed that it was my freshman

09:20.388 --> 09:31.881
year. There was a fellow there that was from 
Alabama. I don't want to mention his name, but he

09:37.427 --> 09:40.630
was from Alabama. He was a Christian student. And 
we had in Jackson at that time a showing of the Billy

09:44.092 --> 09:53.926
Graham film, which was called The Restless Ones. 
And it was shown at the Mississippi State

09:53.946 --> 10:02.678
Coliseum. That's where they have the state fair. 
And this young man, with all the innocence in the

10:06.604 --> 10:14.014
world, with a genuine concern to reach out, he 
invited a black girl to go with him to this Billy

10:14.956 --> 10:27.493
Graham crusade. And his interest was

10:27.513 --> 10:37.266
that he

10:27.513 --> 10:37.266
really wanted to hear what was going on. Or if she 
was already Christian, he wanted her to find out

10:37.286 --> 10:43.815
about the film. He took her. And I can remember 
that, and this is all tied in with your question, so

10:46.262 --> 10:52.831
don't worry about it. I haven't forgotten your 
question. But this student went ahead and took her

10:54.594 --> 11:10.056
on to that

10:54.594 --> 11:10.056
film, and then

10:54.594 --> 11:10.056
later that afternoon, I think it was after dinner, 
and it was, you know, the afternoon. It's daylight

11:16.389 --> 11:19.394
for longer than usual. We had, I think, kind of a 
devotions of some sort out on the steps of one of the

11:19.414 --> 11:29.189
buildings there. And right in the middle of that, 
someone came up and announced that a bunch of the

11:29.209 --> 11:36.600
basketball players were after this student from 
Alabama. And so a couple of guys took off to go find

11:42.665 --> 11:51.476
out what was going on. And then I kind of got some of 
the information. And what we found out was that

11:55.622 --> 12:03.752
these basketball players, a number of them from 
Mississippi, a number of them from Louisiana,

12:04.508 --> 12:13.977
were outraged, this guy would take a black group to 
this Billy Graham. And they were out to beat him up

12:14.598 --> 12:19.583
for doing it. And so these other guys took off to go 
try to protect him. So I took off to go find out what

12:23.627 --> 12:26.970
in the world was going on. And I remember we were up 
on the third floor of Wells Hall, as it was called.

12:35.002 --> 12:47.922
It was grim, because I was on one end of it, and all 
the basketball players were on the other end,

12:35.002 --> 12:47.922
standing outside of this young man's locked dorm 
door. He was inside, hiding for his life. And these

12:51.708 --> 12:56.115
guys were outside, and they were ready to take him 
apart. And about that time, the coach came over

12:56.135 --> 13:01.363
there, and he kind of cleared him out of it. He 
wasn't very happy with it. with her attitude, but

13:03.622 --> 13:27.656
neither was he very happy with what that student 
did, because he was from Louisiana, and reflected

13:03.622 --> 13:27.656
some of those very attitudes himself, and was 
himself in no way at that time had come to know

13:03.622 --> 13:27.656
Christ in his life, and basically was being 
dominated by a sinful and self-centered godless

13:03.622 --> 13:27.656
perspective. Now for myself, I think something of 
my pilgrimage in working through race

13:32.798 --> 13:45.198
relationships,

13:32.798 --> 13:45.198
I think I had been working through some things. I 
think the early civil rights movement and all this

13:45.218 --> 13:57.798
discussion about race relations had prompted me, 
since I've been a Christian, to be thinking

13:45.218 --> 13:57.798
through my own attitude. In fact, I remember when I 
was very young, and lived in Atlanta, that I was, I

14:01.452 --> 14:10.944
remember saying, yes sir, to a black man, and I was 
reprimanded for doing that. You don't do that. You

14:13.727 --> 14:14.628
don't say, ma'am, or sir, to a black man. And so, I 
myself was a product of southern, a certain aspect

14:14.648 --> 14:22.378
of old south culture. But I was, I had become a 
Christian. And so I had, that So I began to think

14:28.520 --> 14:39.469
through, as a Christian, what should my attitude 
be toward black people and race relationships?

14:39.489 --> 14:58.105
And I can remember specifically sitting down and 
reading in the first chapter, no, second chapter

14:39.489 --> 14:58.105
of James, where James is rebuking the 
discriminatory attitude that had grown up among

14:39.489 --> 14:58.105
some of the Christians that he was writing to 
concerning the rich and poor where they bring the

14:58.456 --> 15:28.446
rich in and put them up at the front and they sit the 
poor back and then James said that's a wrong

14:58.456 --> 15:28.446
attitude that you have because he goes on to say God 
is not a respecter of persons and when I read that I

14:58.456 --> 15:28.446
was convicted I said here's my answer here's what 
my attitude is toward people toward black people

14:58.456 --> 15:28.446
toward people that are not like me they're the 
image of God, and I need to relate to them in a loving

15:29.253 --> 15:42.967
way, and relate to them as I would want to be related 
to, and so forth and so on. And I really think that

15:43.167 --> 15:56.340
the grace of God in my heart, plus the wisdom of God 
according to the Scripture and His directions for

15:43.167 --> 15:56.340
my life, worked in me to begin to make some changes 
in my evidence. So I think by the time that happened

15:57.215 --> 16:04.225
to that young man from Alabama, my attitudes were 
already beginning to change. And that was toward,

16:04.245 --> 16:12.816
it would have been in the spring, probably 
freshman

16:04.245 --> 16:12.816
year. Just kind of aside, are the basketball 
players, were they recruited? Or were they just

16:18.284 --> 16:22.650
taken from the student population? They were 
recruited. And how much... Was it a strict

16:28.838 --> 16:36.205
Christian school?

16:39.368 --> 16:41.489
What was the ratio? I don't really want to put a 
ratio on it, but it's a liberal arts college. What

16:48.796 --> 16:51.679
was associated with the church? What you're 
really asking is how Christian was this Christian

16:52.599 --> 16:57.664
college? And I would have to say that it was, while 
everybody on the faculty was required to make some

16:58.167 --> 17:14.269
kind of Christian assent, it was certainly 
debatable whether we were dealing with

17:14.873 --> 17:44.340
evangelical Christians, and what I mean by 
evangelical Christian is a person that believes

17:14.873 --> 17:44.340
that Christ's death on the cross was a vicarious 
atonement, a substitutionary atonement, was

17:14.873 --> 17:44.340
paying for the sins of sinners, and that through 
faith along with Christ we are forgiven for our

17:14.873 --> 17:44.340
sins, and believe in the scriptures being 
inerrant in its original communication, and then

17:14.873 --> 17:44.340
protected in its scripturation. and protected in 
its transmission,

17:45.215 --> 17:55.030
not everyone on the faculty would have fit that 
description. And certainly not everybody in the

17:55.050 --> 17:58.214
student body fit that description. We had some 
students who came from Christian homes who were

17:58.234 --> 18:11.374
the most rebellious people you'd ever seen in your 
life because they didn't want to be there, the

17:58.234 --> 18:11.374
music didn't need to be there, and they weren't 
happy about it at all. So, and then you had some

18:12.417 --> 18:20.545
people that were genuine laborers and you had some 
faculty who were genuine laborers. So, how many, I

18:20.745 --> 18:36.281
guess, you kind of split up in like cliques or 
whatever, groups, and how many people overall

18:20.745 --> 18:36.281
would you say the enrollment was about? About 600. 
About 600. About how many general groups, I guess,

18:43.518 --> 18:59.258
or how many general conflicts probably were there 
as far as, like you have your Christians on one side

18:43.518 --> 18:59.258
or your Evangelicals, and then was there a wide 
spectrum of varying opinions? Well, you had

19:01.261 --> 19:02.543
different groups. Your largest group, religious 
group, was probably called Westminster

19:02.743 --> 19:11.955
Fellowship, and that was predominantly a 
Presbyterian group. kind of fellowship that we'd

19:12.560 --> 19:26.464
meet in a large group meeting on a Thursday night 
and we'd fill up the science lecture hall and

19:12.560 --> 19:26.464
probably have anywhere from 100 to maybe 150 
packed in there and have a good meeting. Then you

19:26.484 --> 19:32.695
had some Methodist and some Baptist and some 
Lutherans. And then you had a number of students

19:33.603 --> 19:42.135
who really didn't make any noise about being 
Christians. But I would have to say it was

19:42.155 --> 19:54.432
predominantly Christians with a minority of 
non-Christians as far as the student body was

19:42.155 --> 19:54.432
concerned. Were there any incidents or 
demonstrations while you were at Belhaven?

19:59.506 --> 20:05.914
outside of like in the community, involved in the 
community? No, not in the big city of Jackson. Of

20:08.237 --> 20:19.451
course, I think it was during that period of time 
that Martin Luther King was assassinated and

20:08.237 --> 20:19.451
there were the riots all over the country. I just 
don't really remember when those three civil

20:19.471 --> 20:28.062
rights workers were killed in Philadelphia, 
Mississippi. by those plane folks.

20:33.463 --> 20:38.673
I can't remember when that was before I came to 
Belle Haven. It seems like it was a while

20:38.693 --> 20:50.533
ago. Was there a lot of... Was there a lot of civil 
unrest for Lillian Jackson as a whole? I don't

20:58.031 --> 21:03.761
really remember a lot of it. How did the views on 
campus change when you were there? Well, it's

21:12.234 --> 21:13.717
interesting. I think that there was growth in 
understanding the implications of the scripture

21:19.375 --> 21:25.662
for race relationships. The Presbyterian Church 
in Mississippi itself was working through those

21:27.565 --> 21:36.735
very issues. And you have, it's very interesting, 
you had liberals, and when I say liberal, that

21:36.755 --> 21:47.728
would be somebody that would reject the Bible as 
really being divinely inspired without error

21:48.198 --> 21:55.767
from beginning to end. And someone that would 
reject miracles of Christ or explain them in a

21:56.908 --> 22:06.359
naturalistic sort of way. But primarily it would 
be a rejection of Scripture as being divinely

22:07.800 --> 22:12.045
inspired. inspired without AR from beginning to 
end in the original manuscripts. I would define

22:18.494 --> 22:20.897
that person as liberal. And there were those 
liberals in the Southern Presbyterian Church in

22:20.917 --> 22:26.505
Mississippi. And they were very social action 
oriented. Their gospel was what we call a social

22:33.175 --> 22:36.921
gospel. They talked in terms of of redeeming 
society and redeeming the

22:40.342 --> 22:52.937
institutions of society. And so the Civil Rights 
Movement was a big thing for them. I mean, that was

22:57.303 --> 22:59.525
where it's at. Down in Mississippi, man, they were 
going to integrate all the churches, and

23:00.106 --> 23:08.557
integration's what we're going to have to do. So 
that was kind of it. banner which they marched

23:10.818 --> 23:15.885
under. Then you had other, what, then you had 
other, you had primarily lay people in

23:15.905 --> 23:34.008
Mississippi that were in the Southern 
Presbyterian Church who resisted that

23:15.905 --> 23:34.008
tremendously. And many of these were, quote, 
conservatives. And I'm going to say they were

23:38.594 --> 23:45.146
conservative in the sense that they were 
politically conservative. And conservative in

23:45.326 --> 23:57.208
the sense that they wanted to conserve certainly 
the cultural position that they were taking when

23:45.326 --> 23:57.208
it came to the matter of segregation and 
integration. And they were also religiously

23:57.228 --> 24:02.458
conservative in the sense that they accepted 
historic biblical Christianity and the teaching

24:03.181 --> 24:15.880
about Christ and His work as Savior, and they 
accepted the Bible as the Word of God in the fullest

24:03.181 --> 24:15.880
sense of the word.

24:16.140 --> 24:23.311
But not all of them had a genuine living faith 
relationship to Christ. It was more cultural than

24:24.793 --> 24:31.703
it was real, although there were some that it was 
very real in. And then you had ministers who were

24:32.712 --> 24:47.805
definitely conservative, but who understood the 
implications of scripture for race relations.

24:47.885 --> 24:58.974
And they recognized the segregation and 
prejudice toward black people because they're

24:47.885 --> 24:58.974
black was really an expression of sin. And so they 
were... They were in an interesting position. And

25:06.894 --> 25:11.158
they were having to be sensitive to the people that 
needed to be led. At the same time, they needed to be

25:12.379 --> 25:20.787
sensitive to the wrong foundation that the 
liberal ministers were operating with. And so

25:20.807 --> 25:31.997
they had a delicate road to walk during the 60s in 
Mississippi as they sought to lead the church and

25:33.040 --> 25:49.284
to lead these conservative lay people into really 
embracing a biblical position in obedience to

25:33.040 --> 25:49.284
Christ and to really move forward. And they made 
some strides. They made some strides in that. And

25:53.390 --> 25:58.137
some of those men were in the Bible department, but 
they didn't come. And so they also had some impact

25:58.673 --> 26:07.904
and influence on the student body in their own 
perspectives about this. So the strides that have

26:08.385 --> 26:27.448
been made in the church in Mississippi when it 
comes to race relations, where it's been among the

26:08.385 --> 26:27.448
conservative Presbyterian church, the 
ministers have led the way.

26:35.558 --> 26:46.209
During this time, it would have been possible to 
say Martin Luther King or another prominent black

26:35.558 --> 26:46.209
activist would have been welcome to give the 
commencement speech. Absolutely not. He would

26:48.572 --> 26:50.674
not have been welcome. Now, with Martin Luther 
King, it's interesting. You've got a... I

26:55.259 --> 26:57.722
remember the Selma March. And I remember my 
attitude toward that was extremely negative. And

27:03.389 --> 27:10.139
the sit-ins and all the things that they did and the 
bus-ins that they did, they're very negative

27:03.389 --> 27:10.139
attitude toward us. And it's negative because of 
the so-called civil disobedience. And civil

27:17.109 --> 27:20.474
disobedience is not civil. It's disobedience. 
It's breaking the law. And that's not to say that

27:23.959 --> 27:27.844
the laws are just. I think they were unjust laws. I 
don't think there's any question of that. But at

27:32.318 --> 27:36.383
the same time, I don't think two wrongs make a 
right. And the

27:36.403 --> 27:51.865
disdain for law that was represented in that 
movement, I really didn't appreciate. And still

27:51.885 --> 27:54.789
don't appreciate. But I do think that God used 
that, and he brought about some changes which are

27:56.967 --> 28:07.098
really good changes in one sense of the word. But 
you see, the problem with the Civil Rights

28:07.118 --> 28:23.575
Movement is, and I think we're seeing this in the 
90s, that the Civil Rights Movement dealt with

28:07.118 --> 28:23.575
externals, but was unable to address the 
internals. And that's the changing of people's

28:23.595 --> 28:25.337
attitudes. You've got people who have 
begrudgingly accepted non-discrimination in

28:26.414 --> 28:44.235
terms of outward behavior, while inside their 
hearts the same old discrimination lives on. And I

28:44.255 --> 28:53.907
really believe it takes the teaching of the 
Scripture and the grace of God in Christ to begin to

28:44.255 --> 28:53.907
make those kind of changes in hearts. And those 
kind of changes in the heart that have been made,

28:54.713 --> 29:00.999
there have been perverts in Mississippi. They've 
got a long ways to go. But there has been some change

29:02.680 --> 29:08.826
in heart attitudes, and it has come through the 
gospel. It hasn't come through legislation and

29:08.846 --> 29:14.891
those changes. Although I think, while I don't 
appreciate it, in the sense that I think that was

29:14.991 --> 29:22.898
the right thing to do, I think today, 25, 30 years 
later, I have a much better appreciation of where

29:23.857 --> 29:37.572
they were coming from, the frustration they felt, 
the sense of injustice that they felt. And

29:37.592 --> 29:49.546
certainly, to be treated as second-class people 
and to be treated as non-people, it does insult

29:37.592 --> 29:49.546
everyone's humanity. And I can appreciate and 
understand where they were coming from, though I

29:52.949 --> 30:05.067
don't appreciate the math that they were working 
with to try to make the changes they made. To get

30:05.087 --> 30:15.803
back to your original question about the, we would 
have, quote, liberal speakers come and speak at

30:05.087 --> 30:15.803
chapel. I remember William Winter who came and 
spoke in chapel. William Winter was at one time

30:20.180 --> 30:23.343
governor of Mississippi. He was more of a moderate 
to liberal governor, politically speaking. He

30:29.931 --> 30:30.772
came and spoke. I think at one time he may have even 
been on the board of Bellarmine College because he

30:30.792 --> 30:38.600
was a Presbyterian. He represented more of that 
liberal wing of the Presbyterian church in

30:38.620 --> 30:45.568
Mississippi. He came and spoke and so forth. But I 
think much beyond that, to have, back when I was

30:49.405 --> 31:08.232
there, to have a plaque to come and speak would have 
been, in a circumstance like Martin Luther King,

30:49.405 --> 31:08.232
would not have been appreciated.

31:10.186 --> 31:18.779
What was taught at Bill Haven concerning black 
citizens? You know, as well as far as in class, you

31:19.500 --> 31:35.705
know, maybe just... Well, there certainly was not 
racism when the issues were addressed. And in

31:35.725 --> 31:37.948
fact, I remember I did a... a paper on race 
relations

31:38.317 --> 31:50.534
for one of my Bible classes. And I remember the 
title of my paper was Race Relations, Not a Black or

31:50.915 --> 32:01.970
White Issue. And I remember the professor saying 
that was a very cool pun in the title. But my

32:09.164 --> 32:35.982
impression is that as far as instruction was 
concerned, that we had men, and primarily where

32:09.164 --> 32:35.982
this was coming from, of course the Mount Major was 
bombed, so I really can't speak for the other

32:09.164 --> 32:35.982
departments, but I would say that the Bible 
department, when we would touch on these issues,

32:09.164 --> 32:35.982
they were really moving us toward a God

32:37.345 --> 32:58.273
would

32:37.345 --> 32:58.273
put out a biblical perspective recognizing the 
image-bearing nature of all of us and the need for

32:37.345 --> 32:58.273
us to deal with them as we would discriminate 
against them because they're different. Q This

32:59.806 --> 33:09.157
gets in a little bit about seminary a little bit 
later, but even while you were at Westminster, how

32:59.806 --> 33:09.157
was a prospective minister? Was there a set way? A 
When I was at Belhaven? Q Well, at Belhaven, and

33:12.721 --> 33:16.005
also when you were at the seminary. A Reform 
seminary? Q Right. How was your training here to

33:18.508 --> 33:21.552
become a minister? How were you? Was there any 
certain way that you were supposed to view it, or

33:22.613 --> 33:28.260
was it really a personal matter?

33:31.733 --> 33:39.264
Well, I don't know that that was, you know, there 
was an over, we didn't have any classes on race

33:31.733 --> 33:39.264
relationships or anything like that. We didn't 
have any classes on multiculturalism and

33:39.284 --> 33:57.910
so-called desensitizing you to this and that kind 
of stuff we're getting now in the 90s in which we're

33:39.284 --> 33:57.910
having to address the very real problem that 
changing legislation does not change human

33:58.345 --> 34:27.728
hearts and we're now finding this out but the I do 
remember as I was in seminary

33:58.345 --> 34:27.728
that I should mention this let me mention this this 
would fold into this in my between my

33:58.345 --> 34:27.728
my My senior year in college and my seminary, after 
I graduated from college, I worked at Briarwood

34:29.480 --> 34:44.479
Presbyterian Church, and I'd also worked there 
the summer before.

34:45.921 --> 34:47.944
Briarwood is in Birmingham, Alabama. It's an 
evangelical church. It was a southern

34:53.273 --> 35:02.628
Presbyterian church back in 68, 69, later came 
into the PCA, helped to form the PCA, Presbyterian

34:53.273 --> 35:02.628
Church of America. And it was a conservative 
church, and one of those churches where they were

35:02.648 --> 35:12.283
really seeking to follow the scripture, and 
really seeking to follow the scripture when the

35:02.648 --> 35:12.283
race was launched. And they began a program called 
Operation, it was called Camp New Face. in which

35:19.025 --> 35:33.005
there was a concerted effort to minister to 
inner-city black children and to take them out at

35:19.025 --> 35:33.005
the expense of Rarwoos Christian Church to a camp. 
It was a Presbytery camp. Presbytery is our way

35:35.728 --> 35:40.215
of... It's kind of like a Baptist... association. 
It's an association, a connected association of

35:47.608 --> 35:53.858
Presbyterian churches in given areas called 
Presbyterian. And Presbyterian Birmingham had a

35:54.359 --> 35:56.402
camp. And Briarwood was a member of that 
Presbyterian. So we used that camp, the

35:58.486 --> 36:01.030
Birmingham Presbyterian camp. And we took some 
black kids out there

36:01.482 --> 36:12.156
to that camp.

36:12.176 --> 36:15.660
And these were, we had little kids, and I worked 
with that camp. Man, it was a tremendous

36:15.680 --> 36:17.202
experience. Just a tremendous experience. I 
remember that was back when Hubert Humphrey was

36:19.966 --> 36:25.633
running against Richard Nixon. And we had a black 
camp director. I remember getting into a little

36:27.825 --> 36:33.095
discussion with him, and he was a hunter 
supporter, and I was in things as a supporter. We

36:33.115 --> 36:35.960
were talking about who could really help out the 
black people the most. It was really a very

36:36.941 --> 36:42.271
enlightening, great time in my life. I made some 
great friends. I had some black parents who were

36:44.275 --> 36:48.482
really wonderful experiences. But once again, we 
see it is the Episcopal Church that was really

36:49.323 --> 37:07.075
leading there in ministry, not just the outward 
conduct, but really seeking the ministry of the

36:49.323 --> 37:07.075
Father. So I think there was a growing conviction 
in me that... that a segregationist attitude

37:12.796 --> 37:38.483
comes to the church, an attitude of, we won't let 
black people come and worship in our churches, one

37:12.796 --> 37:38.483
that I couldn't tolerate to the point that I 
remember when I graduated as a senior and was

37:12.796 --> 37:38.483
looking at churches, that one of my questions that 
I would ask was, what is your attitude toward black

37:12.796 --> 37:38.483
people in this church? So

37:40.775 --> 37:48.725
whatever was contributing to that, there were a 
lot of things contributing to that. Running the

37:48.745 --> 37:53.791
board is working my life and just lots of things. 
But it wasn't a case of seminary, you know,

37:53.811 --> 38:04.925
sitting in a stand and saying, here's the attitude 
you want me to take. How are... In the early 60s,

38:07.471 --> 38:21.065
there was a book written by a black like me, by John 
Howard Griffin, where he went through, traveled

38:07.471 --> 38:21.065
through the South, and appeared as both a black 
person and as a white person. And later on in the

38:21.585 --> 38:33.377
experiment, he would go through town as a black 
person to be treated one way by the black people,

38:21.585 --> 38:33.377
and then go back through as a white person. and the 
black people would just disdain and everything

38:33.728 --> 38:38.174
and wouldn't have anything to do with it. How were 
the black attitudes, the black children,

38:38.194 --> 38:43.580
counselors, and other people? You know, that was 
really interesting. That's a good question. My

38:48.506 --> 38:54.454
experience with that was that the high school guys 
were woke. I took an authoritarian approach to my

38:55.055 --> 38:59.500
discipline with them. In the cabin, for example, 
I'd say, okay, let's get your beds made. They

39:04.473 --> 39:05.214
wouldn't be doing it. I'd say, okay, I want you all 
to go. I want you to get down and do ten push-ups. And

39:08.677 --> 39:12.382
that guy just fell on the bed and was laughing at me. 
I said, whoa, what are we going to do here? There was

39:14.144 --> 39:18.309
no respect or authority whatsoever. In fact, I 
remember in that camp, the camp broke out into a

39:18.329 --> 39:23.975
great big fight. And I was very thankful that we 
had... a wrestler on staff that was from the

39:27.239 --> 39:30.643
University of Michigan. And he was a big old guy, 
and he just waded into the group and grabbed about

39:30.663 --> 39:35.007
five of them and pulled them out. And, well, I was 
glad to see him around. But that's kind of a scary

39:37.590 --> 39:40.353
thing. But with the little kids, the kids, you 
know, like maybe middler age, maybe 5th grade, 6th

39:40.593 --> 39:51.745
grade, 4th, 5th, 6th, all they would do. And God

39:52.096 --> 40:03.932
has really done some tremendous work in their 
mind. Father was there. And it was a tremendous

40:04.312 --> 40:05.374
time, just a tremendous time. A number of kids 
really came to know the Savior and had experience.

40:07.437 --> 40:10.461
So that's the way I see it. The older they got,

40:10.481 --> 40:19.673
they seemed to get more burdened, more of a, which I 
guess would be true with white kids. You need kids,

40:20.041 --> 40:21.983
I mean all sorts of kids. That's just kind of the way 
it is across the board. Does that kind of get you to

40:27.170 --> 40:31.235
your question? How many on staff there, how many 
counselors were funded in Cape Town? Now when you

40:38.825 --> 40:40.167
say that. At Bellhaven? Well, Bellhaven and Camp. 
Camp New Face? Yeah. Oh, I think all of them. Okay.

40:50.665 --> 40:53.809
Unless it was the... No, I think they're all from 
this town. How about Bellhaven? Are there any

40:54.731 --> 40:58.876
students from up north? Very.

41:04.263 --> 41:10.652
Were the students... During this time, there's 
also a big campus... you know, students' free

41:11.206 --> 41:19.283
speech movement on campuses across America and 
Berkeley, California and everything is going on.

41:19.824 --> 41:22.089
How was that treated at Belhaven? Well, it kind of 
emerged a little bit at Belhaven. You know, I was in

41:24.975 --> 41:30.868
the middle of Vietnam as well and I remember our I 
think it was the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. I think

41:35.113 --> 41:48.007
our Student Government Association, SGA, voted a 
resolution disapproving of the Gulf of Tonkin

41:35.113 --> 41:48.007
Resolution. And I think that there was unrest with 
respect to the administration. I remember the

41:51.691 --> 41:55.475
closest thing we ever got to a riot on campus. All 
the students gathered into the into the

41:58.574 --> 42:02.859
cafeteria, and we were really upset about some 
things. I don't remember exactly what it was, but I

42:02.879 --> 42:11.509
remember the president, Howard J. Cleveland, at 
the time, he came in and addressed everybody. But

42:11.569 --> 42:21.301
there was something of an angry spirit, kind of an 
angry atmosphere.

42:23.924 --> 42:27.568
Were you all fairly free to discuss The Civil 
Rights Movement? Oh, sure.

42:34.861 --> 42:41.629
On to a little bit about PCA, history of PCA a little 
bit. What was the doctrine of the church? Was there

42:46.275 --> 42:47.196
an official? The church really didn't take any 
kind of official position on this question. The

42:51.881 --> 42:57.488
old Southern Presbyterian Church did adopt a 
change in their book church order which

42:57.873 --> 43:21.332
specifically says that churches will not 
discriminate on race or color when it comes to

42:57.873 --> 43:21.332
membership in the church and in the when the pca was 
in 1973 there were Some of the churches that helped

43:22.105 --> 43:29.793
form the BCNA were segregationist churches. They 
were churches

43:29.813 --> 43:38.423
that...

43:38.443 --> 43:42.647
So you had some churches that were segregationist 
churches. In fact, maybe even some churches that

43:42.667 --> 43:48.113
had policies people

43:48.818 --> 43:59.450
being allowed to come into their churches. And of 
course, we had Trinity Presbyterian Church that

43:59.470 --> 44:01.372
was in Montgomery, Alabama. That was a very famous 
church. The Supreme Court Justice, Chief Justice

44:04.135 --> 44:10.843
of the Supreme Court of Alabama was a member of that 
congregation. And I think it was back in the 1960s

44:11.060 --> 44:30.904
that the pastor then, who was Robert Strong, stood 
out in front of the church with all the news there

44:11.060 --> 44:30.904
and all the cameras and black people coming up and 
making a point there in Montgomery about this

44:11.060 --> 44:30.904
segregationist church. And the pastor 
graciously

44:31.805 --> 44:40.476
saying, you will not be permitted to come worship 
here. That church came into the PCA. In fact, that

44:46.341 --> 44:50.007
church was one of the founding churches of the PCA. 
Then you got Briarwood. You got Briarwood taking a

44:51.370 --> 44:54.616
very different perspective on it. Briarwood was 
receiving black members and blacks into

44:54.636 --> 45:07.138
membership and leading a different approach 
there. you've got i would say in the dca day

45:07.507 --> 45:28.806
probably you've got pockets pockets

45:07.507 --> 45:28.806
very small very much where you would have these 
would be old old established churches in some

45:07.507 --> 45:28.806
parts of the south that still holding on to some 
remnants, although I don't know of any churches

45:29.377 --> 45:38.665
that have any kind of official policies about 
closed-door policies. I think maybe all of those

45:40.307 --> 45:43.189
are gone. But there may still be some attitudes, a 
hardening of the attitude that is still hanging

45:43.209 --> 45:52.278
on. So I would say that the overwhelming, the 
overwhelming Your

45:58.098 --> 46:10.238
position certainly reflects my position.

46:10.399 --> 46:17.070
Like here at Westminster, I mean, it's not even an 
issue. I mean, we have black, we have Indian, we

46:17.090 --> 46:20.055
have Korean, we have, you know, we're here to 
minister to all the people in this town. and

46:20.896 --> 46:46.279
we're we're out here reaching wherever the lord 
gives us an opportunity to reach i think the gospel

46:20.896 --> 46:46.279
has made that possible the gospel I think the ease 
with which we deal with this is because we are a

46:46.985 --> 46:51.449
diverse congregation. We don't necessarily 
reflect a predominantly Old South cultural

46:51.469 --> 47:08.365
perspective, although I think there is certainly 
a number of people in the Old South that are members

46:51.469 --> 47:08.365
of the congregation. I think that has helped make 
that easier to deal

47:08.385 --> 47:14.070
with. I think in, you know, there, like in 
Briarwood, There were some things they had to work

47:16.094 --> 47:24.566
through, some tensions they had to work through, 
but they had to work them through very

47:16.094 --> 47:24.566
successfully. So, you know, as far as the PCA is 
concerned, we are far less of a segregationist

47:25.027 --> 47:42.793
kind of group in 1993

47:25.027 --> 47:42.793
than we were in 1970. When was the PCA formed? 1973. 
And it was formed primarily by churches that came

47:46.974 --> 47:56.107
out of the old southern Presbyterian church. You 
had a mixture there. You had some, in memory I was

47:57.769 --> 48:08.443
talking about, you had those conservatives who 
were in Mississippi that were segregationist

47:57.769 --> 48:08.443
oriented and then you had And then you had 
conservatives who were saying, no, we need to...

48:08.744 --> 48:17.394
That's really not consistent with the scriptural 
approach. And I think you had some of that mixture

48:17.414 --> 48:22.379
that came into the piece of that. Although I think 
the dominant... the dominant position would have

48:22.399 --> 48:32.771
been those conservatives that would say 
segregation needs to go. It's not scriptural.

48:35.834 --> 48:38.177
Were there any... Was it... Primarily the 
southern churches? Primarily southern

48:41.450 --> 48:42.151
churches. Were there any northern churches? In 
about 1983, the Reformed

48:44.213 --> 48:57.669
Presbyterian Church, which is primarily 
northern,

48:44.213 --> 48:57.669
united with the PCM. So we're much more of a 
national church than we were.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.282
How would you say that the... Overall, the events, 
the civil rights movement and everything going

49:08.633 --> 49:15.783
on, how did that affect your education? Is there 
anything else?

49:21.350 --> 49:35.569
Well, I think,

49:21.350 --> 49:35.569
I would say that it

49:21.350 --> 49:35.569
didn't affect my education. because I got out of 
public school before all the upheaval of

49:36.022 --> 50:01.360
integrating all those schools came in, which had 
a, I think, from a pedagogical point of view, a

49:36.022 --> 50:01.360
devastating effect on the education of blacks

49:36.022 --> 50:01.360
and whites. I think trying to mix social 
engineering in with pedagogy was disastrous.

50:14.310 --> 50:15.251
There should have been. The busing, the whole 
busing thing, it was terribly chaotic, terribly

50:15.271 --> 50:28.729
chaotic. So how would you, How would you have fixed 
it, so to say? Well, how would I have fixed it?

50:38.906 --> 50:42.311
That's a really good question.

50:43.052 --> 50:49.642
I think I might have been more gradual than 
revolutionary. I think I might have wanted to

50:49.662 --> 50:58.817
start at the lowest grades and face it. I would... I 
would have wanted to bring in the influence of the

51:00.127 --> 51:18.507
church, and here particularly I would think the 
conservative church that is preaching the

51:00.127 --> 51:18.507
gospel, but also is really preaching a biblical 
view of the relations of the races. And have sought

51:18.527 --> 51:25.915
to bring them in as allies to help them work with 
adults, to work with parents, to help them work

51:18.527 --> 51:25.915
through these issues. and i would have i wanted the 
court's mandate and basically ramming

51:26.401 --> 51:47.380
down people's throats and i think that that the 
evolutionary approach would have i think been

51:26.401 --> 51:47.380
more effective rather than revolutionary, which 
I think would have been more effective for public

51:48.710 --> 52:05.426
education, for the quality of public education. 
And I think it would have been more effective in

52:05.446 --> 52:12.933
dealing with the basic attitudes that people 
have, prejudices and so forth. And we would be

52:12.953 --> 52:18.278
where we are in 1993, I think, which is, We've got 
real problems in public education. And we've

52:21.575 --> 52:24.919
still got real problems in race relations. So we 
had a revolution. But the revolution, as I think

52:27.642 --> 52:37.852
revolutions frequently do, while there was a lot 
of change, there was a lot of chaos. And there's a

52:39.014 --> 52:43.118
lot of destruction. uh remnant of destruction 
that we're still

52:44.110 --> 53:02.895
trying to recover from

52:44.110 --> 53:02.895
um in and looking back again over the years is there 
anything that you regret doing
