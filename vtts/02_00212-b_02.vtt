WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:04.579
I hate this. You wouldn't think so. Once daylight 
came, how much damage had been done to the house?

00:13.500 --> 00:14.743
You'd have to look at the picture. Our stuff, a lot 
of it had been carried out and a lot of it hadn't.

00:19.285 --> 00:25.873
First thing I remember was somebody came to me and 
said, Ms. Williams, your tea set is at such and such

00:19.285 --> 00:25.873
a place. Now, the tea set is in the living room and on 
the tray it says to Jack Williams from his friends

00:25.953 --> 00:34.063
at Clemson. And the whole tea set was given to him 
when we left here. That was carried out. And then

00:39.730 --> 00:41.392
the men started coming in. You see it was still 
water dripping and so forth. And they started

00:44.576 --> 00:46.238
carrying things out. And they were working 
panically. They weren't calm at all getting stuff

00:51.890 --> 00:53.713
out there. I don't know where they thought the roof 
was going to fall in on them or not. And they were

00:56.397 --> 00:57.960
carrying out a chest. And I said, let me get my 
clock. And they didn't even hear me. And my clock

01:00.524 --> 01:02.087
fell and was broken. I still have it in there 
patched up. But people, and I was out in the street.

02:29.138 --> 02:34.126
I went to the bathroom and got his shaving gear and 
everything we needed and moved it out with us. And

02:35.368 --> 02:42.438
Nelda didn't say anything after she saw that I had 
gotten it all before we left. About what

02:43.540 --> 02:50.391
percentage of the furnishings, your 
furnishings, were destroyed?

02:55.839 --> 02:55.939
Half. No, I would say that not much was completely 
destroyed. A lot of it had to be cleaned and

03:00.096 --> 03:03.200
reupholstered and that thing. And

03:04.802 --> 03:09.427
the insurance company took care of that. They were 
very good about it. And we moved down to that other

03:12.031 --> 03:15.575
house in Bryan. And what I did was I took the living 
dining area, they blended together, and I used the

03:16.456 --> 03:25.588
living room and dining room as a storage room. And 
then I furnished for us the den and a bedroom for us

03:26.193 --> 03:35.790
and another bedroom with Jack's office in it. And 
of course we had a kitchen, but I just used, I bought

03:37.053 --> 03:47.712
a screen that's down in the basement and put it out 
in the hallway to block off the living room and the

03:37.053 --> 03:47.712
dining room. And that was our storage room for our 
furniture. And I can adjust to anything. If you

03:54.532 --> 04:05.225
lived in a trailer without a bathroom for a year and 
a half, you could certainly live in brine in a house

03:54.532 --> 04:05.225
that you knew was temporary. And one other thing 
that told you a lot about Jack, we had one man who had

04:06.867 --> 04:14.536
helped us when we moved to College Station. He came 
in.

04:20.024 --> 04:22.067
I wanted to say Donaldson, that wasn't his name. 
Joe Donaldson? No, that wasn't his name. Anyway,

04:26.313 --> 04:34.024
he came in and started telling me what we needed for 
the president's house, and he was just out buying

04:26.313 --> 04:34.024
it, and then he found out that we were paying for it 
all. And when we got our first bill of $3,000, and

04:34.344 --> 04:45.340
Jack wrote the bill, wrote the check for it, he 
found out that the university wasn't buying this

04:34.344 --> 04:45.340
stuff that he was bringing in that we needed. And so 
he stopped. He said, I didn't realize you all were

04:48.287 --> 04:52.998
paying for this, but I got some nice things out of 
that $3,000. And

04:55.343 --> 04:58.992
we...

05:04.321 --> 05:05.562
We were okay. We were going, and I picked the house 
in, it was picked for me before we got to Houston by

05:05.582 --> 05:15.813
the president's wife and the agent showed us his 
house. And after we went home, we looked at a few and

05:16.194 --> 05:19.357
she called back and said, you want it? And I said, 
yes, I want it. And that was the only one we looked

05:20.798 --> 05:27.746
at, the one we lived in on Drummond, close enough to 
the medical center that Jack could come home for

05:20.798 --> 05:27.746
lunch. Looking back on the A&M years, who would you 
want to thank most? for their kindness during

05:34.747 --> 05:37.571
those years?

05:41.296 --> 05:42.858
Many names as you want to? Oh yeah, there'd be a 
whole lot of names in there. And they mainly were

05:45.080 --> 05:49.606
the people that looked after Jack and looked after 
things. And anything I wanted, the university was

05:50.347 --> 05:54.212
just wonderful about it. When I wanted a door just 
in the family dining room, to close off the

06:00.869 --> 06:02.231
kitchen. Can you imagine sitting there with 
somebody at the sink running the dishwasher when

06:02.471 --> 06:08.459
you're trying to have a meal in family dining area? 
And I asked for a door, and they put me up a beautiful

06:09.360 --> 06:11.843
door. And then when they were enclosing the back, 
they were going to just cover up enough to broil

06:12.604 --> 06:19.413
steaks. For Earl, they'd had to broil steaks in the 
rain or something. So they wanted that enclosed,

06:23.078 --> 06:25.982
the idea of enclosing that area was came from the 
MSC because they'd had to come over there and work

06:26.165 --> 06:32.796
and cater. And I said, no, let's run it down here. 
And we ran it, you know, enlarged it, which was a

06:35.821 --> 06:39.486
good addition. And then after we left, it was 
enlarged even more. But I only asked for two things

06:42.571 --> 06:46.217
while the time I lived in that Preston's house. One 
was that door and the other one was the Amari bowl

06:47.139 --> 06:52.307
for the dining room table. And Bill Paulman, I told 
Bill Paulman what I wanted. I wanted a bowl. Is it

06:57.433 --> 06:58.133
still there? Notice when you go.

07:01.836 --> 07:04.118
I want a bowl that will sit alone. It needs no 
flowers that can sit on its own on the middle of this

07:04.298 --> 07:09.062
dining room table. And he said, what do you have in 
mind? I said, well, an Amari bowl. And he came on the

07:13.746 --> 07:16.369
airplane and carried it in his hands. And how much 
the university paid for that bowl, I don't know.

07:20.072 --> 07:22.834
But Margaret Rutter liked to do flower 
arrangements. And I wanted something. I was

07:24.537 --> 07:25.679
growing plants. I thought green plants brought 
the house alive. And so I was just buying them and

07:28.804 --> 07:31.668
killing them and buying some more. Jack didn't 
care. You know, it's our money. But that's the only

07:35.955 --> 07:40.463
two things I can remember ever asking for all the 
time I lived there. Do you remember any attempts of

07:41.124 --> 07:49.918
student humor at the president's house where the 
students attempted to play a joke or anything or?

07:50.506 --> 07:51.187
do something. No, only the two times that they 
rolled the campus, rolled the house. What were

07:56.776 --> 08:01.383
the, was there in a, no, I've seen the picture. 
You've seen the one in the bathroom? Yes. Okay,

08:02.906 --> 08:04.188
that was the second time. The first time they got 
caught. And see, I had the experience of having a

08:06.552 --> 08:15.526
teenage daughter in Knoxville, so I knew that if 
you were attracted to a girl, then you went out and

08:06.552 --> 08:15.526
rolled her lawn. And the first time, We got now what 
we did the second time. Mary said, Mother, all you

08:20.698 --> 08:23.685
have to do is get the hose and wash it down. Mary knew 
about it. So anyway, the first time John Coldis

08:25.248 --> 08:36.291
came to Jack, they got caught and run off, and they 
left a whole box of toilet tissue, which I kept. I

08:36.845 --> 08:39.567
couldn't find, say, y'all come back and get your 
paper. And the second time, they didn't wake us up,

08:40.168 --> 08:44.372
and they've completed the job. I mean, they really 
webbed it. But the first time, John said, don't

08:47.715 --> 08:49.696
punish them. He said, they just said they did it 
because they liked you. And the second time is the

08:53.400 --> 08:56.102
one we have the picture of in the bathroom. Have you 
seen it? It's in there by the window. But that was,

09:00.306 --> 09:05.250
other than that, the students, can you think of 
anything they did? I don't. No, I can't remember in

09:06.460 --> 09:12.049
Aggie lingo any good bull. Now, didn't they come 
over to the house one of the first nights y'all were

09:12.650 --> 09:15.675
there? Didn't the band come over and play? Well, 
they had a yell session for Jack, and that's when

09:17.958 --> 09:23.707
they got the money from the man read about it in the 
paper. This is when there was so much problem.

09:25.711 --> 09:27.614
Isn't that sweet, that picture? Yes, it is. My 
brother, my son-in-law, Catherine's husband

09:29.900 --> 09:34.587
brought me that from Jerusalem. He brought me that 
bowl, and he brought me that vase right there. When

09:38.553 --> 09:40.396
he goes on these trips, he brings me a gift. All 
right, we're not far from being finished. Let me

09:45.604 --> 09:55.198
beg you again, please don't, at some point, don't 
let family papers that relate to experience at

09:45.604 --> 09:55.198
Clemson and Texas A&M, please don't let those get 
destroyed. I had said I didn't know what to do, and

09:59.013 --> 10:09.328
there's a picture here I want to go back to A&M 
that's in the living room that Polly Krueger gave

09:59.013 --> 10:09.328
us, and I thanked him for it. I wrote him a letter and 
thanked him on behalf of the university, and he

10:09.889 --> 10:23.008
went to Jack and said, I gave Margaret Rutter one 
and the other president's wife one, and this is for

10:09.889 --> 10:23.008
Margaret, and I want it back if she doesn't want it, 
and it'll only cost her a kiss. And so I still have

10:23.495 --> 10:29.902
the picture, and he died since then, but I feel like 
it's not the size. It means that it should be at the

10:30.763 --> 10:35.228
university instead of in either one of the girls' 
houses. They could carry it. Mary said, Mother, I

10:36.990 --> 10:38.032
love it. It's got snow and water both. You know, she 
skis with ice and water. But I would like for that to

10:43.278 --> 10:45.480
go back sometime. And I had said something to Nelda 
about Jack's papers. I don't know whether there's

10:52.216 --> 10:54.920
anything there that's valuable or not. There 
would be for a historian. But she said, I'll take

10:57.163 --> 10:59.767
them. I'll keep them for you, which is so like her. 
Yes. You know, she had kept clippings for all that

11:04.354 --> 11:17.634
time that he was there and had just, we'd moved into 
the board house, and they were at the foot of his bed

11:04.354 --> 11:17.634
on a bench, and the fire water was there. But she had 
kept very carefully newspaper clippings for that

11:17.654 --> 11:22.020
whole period. All right, you see, it is to 
understand the record 10, 50, 100 years from now

11:23.232 --> 11:39.386
that I'm concerned about, and the A&M Archives is 
now in very good condition in the Cushing Library,

11:23.232 --> 11:39.386
the old part of the library, and very well 
organized. So I'm begging that at some point,

11:39.406 --> 11:52.817
whenever you think it's appropriate, perhaps in 
your estate, that those not be destroyed, but be

11:39.406 --> 11:52.817
put at whatever place you think is best, whether it 
be Clemson or A&M or Summit both? Well, I feel like

11:55.559 --> 11:59.024
that A&M would be... I don't think there's much 
Clemson because Jack had a secretary here that

12:01.688 --> 12:11.101
just kept everything. And every once in a while she 
would say, I need a new filing cabinet. So he would

12:15.248 --> 12:18.973
send her off to lunch and he would stay there and 
clear out the filing cabinets. and say, here's

12:19.882 --> 12:22.004
your filing cabinet. When she got back, he had just 
emptied enough. But he threw everything away.

12:26.990 --> 12:28.872
Nelda was the person who kept things. And a few 
personal, anything that was controversial here,

12:29.613 --> 12:38.884
he did not leave for the next person to have in his 
files. He took them to the president and put them in

12:38.924 --> 12:41.867
the president's files. That's good. That's good. 
That's the way he worked.

12:48.265 --> 12:50.448
And whatever he has in there. Every now and a while I 
see something. You know, I've got several things

12:52.190 --> 13:03.383
full of papers back there, but I didn't know where 
to leave them for the girls to try to figure out what

12:52.190 --> 13:03.383
to do with them. We could, Mary and I especially, 
Mary's the one that's linked to Texas A&M, and

13:04.905 --> 13:14.636
Catherine is the brain that has good judgment. 
Well, you see, we don't, People don't keep diaries

13:15.839 --> 13:21.985
anymore, and it's these private papers that are 
the essential. Well, Jack's diaries

13:22.105 --> 13:35.278
were not anything but just a note for himself, what 
he had to be, where he had to be, and an address or a

13:22.105 --> 13:35.278
time. He didn't write anything else. And he and I 
both agreed that it was so sad that here I had kept

13:38.842 --> 13:45.829
all his letters for those five years, that we were, 
well, three, yeah, five years we knew each other

13:46.653 --> 13:53.185
before we married. And I kept them, and when we 
moved in this house, I put them in hat boxes in the

13:53.645 --> 13:58.073
attic. And when we were moving to Texas, they had 
silverfish in them. So I took them out and took a

14:03.042 --> 14:07.350
couple of days to take the garbage can and burn all 
the letters. And later... So that was when he told

14:09.721 --> 14:17.354
me everything he did and I knew his friends, I knew 
these people, and I got a good description. And we

14:18.536 --> 14:23.445
both agreed that it was a sad time, sad that I burned 
the letters. And he said, but they were mushy. You

14:26.900 --> 14:33.907
see, that would, like the recent George Bush book 
of his own, that would be a book right there. Well,

14:33.967 --> 14:37.010
his Marine Corps letters would have been really 
interesting. That's what I mean. But anyway, they

14:38.972 --> 14:40.053
were mean. He and this other man in the Marine 
Corps, after he ran an office, and every day he

14:40.093 --> 14:47.561
wrote he had another job. They kept adding to his 
work because he could get it done. He didn't have

14:51.705 --> 14:53.527
any family or anybody. And he's fast. But they had 
this trick that the Navy came in, and see, the

14:55.688 --> 15:05.040
Marines have to sleep on the ground, you know, and 
they don't have any good clean facilities or

14:55.688 --> 15:05.040
anything like that. And the Navy people would come 
in for billeting. Jack was the billeting officer

15:09.028 --> 15:13.954
and the court recorder and all kinds of things. And 
they had a joke about sending them to somebody

15:14.835 --> 15:18.859
else. And they said, no, you get that from so and so. 
And they were sending these Navy people all

15:21.723 --> 15:26.808
around. Just out of meanness. But Jack's next war, 
he had planned to be in the Navy where you had clean

15:27.950 --> 15:33.576
sheets.

15:34.501 --> 15:38.164
What were your feelings about your task at A&M? 
What was the president's wife? What was her role as

15:40.146 --> 15:43.409
you thought of it? Well, my role was I didn't think 
of myself as being very important now. My role was

15:49.395 --> 15:56.021
to run the house, take care of him, and do whatever 
somebody told me I should do. And I added one thing

15:56.061 --> 16:02.567
that they still do, the Saul Ross Tee. That was my 
idea. I said, if the ladies come back here and their

16:05.290 --> 16:10.760
husbands are in the Sul Ross place, then I should 
have them for tea. And I've been reminded since I

16:11.301 --> 16:15.869
lived here that they still have the Sul Ross tea. 
Have you ever been to a Sul Ross tea? I used to help

16:18.453 --> 16:19.375
you. Well, I can't remember. It's all so far back. 
But that was my idea. And then I did do one other

16:26.166 --> 16:28.650
thing that was new. When they got girls 
sororities, and these were academic sororities,

16:29.331 --> 16:38.285
not social, they came for breakfast and 
initiations. And I had worked out a system with my

16:38.806 --> 16:46.999
caterers that that bar that was out on that back, 
closed-in area, there's a rolling bar back there.

16:49.274 --> 16:52.124
We could move that up across the kitchen table.

16:55.415 --> 16:58.305
Move it to where it was convenient to the kitchen. 
and have a pick-up breakfast on it. Those groups

17:01.363 --> 17:09.635
could come in and have their breakfast and an 
initiation and be gone in an hour for their 8

17:01.363 --> 17:09.635
o'clock class. Now that worked out real well.

17:14.362 --> 17:17.726
Of course, the board came unless they wanted to go 
to see football practice. We had one board member

17:19.068 --> 17:21.171
that was scary.

17:27.800 --> 17:33.771
He would walk out, he would put his cigarette, he 
never stuffed out a cigarette. He just put it down,

17:35.013 --> 17:37.618
left it burning. And I would always say, you all go 
on, I have to do some picking up. I always stayed to

17:41.786 --> 17:47.496
find out how many burning cigarettes he had left 
around in that wild. But you know what I'm saying is

17:48.505 --> 18:11.458
I didn't feel like when they asked, when the TV 
station wanted to come out and interview me, I sent

17:48.505 --> 18:11.458
back word no because I met her after Jarvis was 
pressed and I was sitting there with Pinky

17:48.505 --> 18:11.458
McCauley and I'd bought tickets for both of us to go 
to this lunch and they announced that... But they

18:12.586 --> 18:16.933
were glad to have Ms. Williams here as a guest. And I 
said out loud, since Pinky was there, I'm not a

18:16.953 --> 18:19.878
guest. I bought two tickets for this. And I didn't 
know that the lady across the street with me was the

18:21.781 --> 18:30.055
one who had called from the TV station wanting to 
come out and interview me. And she identified

18:30.288 --> 18:34.472
herself, said, I didn't know who I was eating with. 
She didn't know me, and I didn't know her. And I

18:36.974 --> 18:43.680
said, then I explained to her that I said, they have 
Jack up to their teeth, and they didn't need me,

18:36.974 --> 18:43.680
too. And I did stop the newcomers from going 
upstairs. And they wanted to block the steps, and I

18:48.064 --> 18:50.786
said, no, that's an insult. But this is not a house 
tour. This is a morning coffee, and they're

18:53.488 --> 18:56.471
supposed to visit with people. And I didn't let 
them go upstairs. I don't know whether you

18:58.453 --> 18:59.974
remember that or not. When Dr. Williams was hired, 
did you assume that they had hired a two-person

19:00.629 --> 19:08.236
team? Never gave it a thought. We were always, you 
know, I didn't think about my having a job. You

19:15.303 --> 19:27.615
know, I did what I had to do here, and I wasn't very 
involved except with his staff at the

19:15.303 --> 19:27.615
coordinating board. And some of the ladies, 
though, whose husbands were his staff at the

19:28.338 --> 19:37.689
board, you know, his media staff, but the members 
of the board, they came to call on me. But they lived

19:38.070 --> 19:42.415
all over the state, so there wasn't anything much 
that I could have done about that. And as I said,

19:42.896 --> 19:50.365
that was a time in my life when I was busy raising two 
girls, and I don't think you'd desert teenage

19:42.896 --> 19:50.365
girls. If someone, next to last question, if 
someone gave you a million-dollar check now, and

19:58.358 --> 20:06.991
had only one requirement, that you must pass that 
check on to Texas A&M, but you can decide what the

19:58.358 --> 20:06.991
check would be used for. What would you tell Texas 
A&M to do with your gift? This million dollars that

20:11.538 --> 20:15.564
somebody hands you and you can pass it on. Well, it 
would go back to the former students. To do what?

20:19.710 --> 20:20.371
Whatever they do. You'd give them complete free 
will to use it? I wouldn't be able to go back there

20:24.667 --> 20:31.037
now and say, or to give it to the president.

20:34.001 --> 20:39.209
Jack always sent to Emory & Henry when he made his 
donations there. It was always for the president,

20:39.309 --> 20:43.215
for his discretionary fund. And I think you could 
do that to the president. He would know where it

20:45.679 --> 20:46.740
went. Now, when somebody dies, when Aggie dies, I 
send it to the former students. Mm-hmm. You know,

20:51.987 --> 21:07.060
NELDA keeps me posted and so forth, and that's 
where I send it, but either to the president for his

20:51.987 --> 21:07.060
discretionary budget or to the former students, 
because I feel like they were looking after

21:07.360 --> 21:10.584
things, and they were so interested in their 
university. For instance, now, first thing I'd do

21:10.924 --> 21:17.071
would be pay off Joe Moore's debt on the sculpture. 
On the sculpture? I just gave him $500 to start

21:18.813 --> 21:27.122
with, but I told him when I was there I'd give him 
$500 or more again if it didn't already get it off of

21:18.813 --> 21:27.122
his back. And I don't know what in the world it cost 
him or what it has cost him. Do you have any idea? No,

21:31.667 --> 21:32.548
I don't. And who paid for the one that went to 
Germany? I have no idea. They sent me a picture of

21:35.879 --> 21:38.662
them gathering in Germany. They sent me snapshots 
of that, and that was a beautiful thing to do. I

21:42.307 --> 21:43.148
agree. All right, what topics have we left out that 
we should have included? What have we not talked

21:48.534 --> 21:51.738
about that you want to be sure is included in this? 
Well, the only thing that I would say was that Jack

21:53.580 --> 21:59.046
was blessed with a good staff. He was blessed with 
students that were not troublemakers. A little

22:06.187 --> 22:12.834
bit of streaking wasn't a great big deal.

22:15.557 --> 22:17.338
The former students were always there to help. The 
faculty wasn't giving them a lot of trouble. I

22:19.541 --> 22:22.003
think things ran rather smoothly. Now, you would 
have known where there was a problem here and a

22:22.323 --> 22:26.127
problem there. The dean of women sent one of her 
problems to Jack. I told you about that. You know,

22:32.917 --> 22:39.446
everybody has problems in their job, but I think 
that Jackwood felt like it ran pretty smoothly.

22:39.507 --> 22:47.919
The board wasn't the easiest thing to deal with, 
but he had good members of the board, wonderful

22:39.507 --> 22:47.919
members of the board to help him.

22:50.943 --> 22:57.633
But you have, nothing's perfect, but I have no 
complaints about anything. Last question then.

23:00.637 --> 23:02.620
What feelings do you hold in your heart about Texas 
A&M now?

23:10.750 --> 23:17.319
I feel like they have a lot of pride in their 
university, that they're willing to help their

23:10.750 --> 23:17.319
university in any way they can. And there's a lot of 
ego every place you go, and then a lot of dedicated

23:17.379 --> 23:27.933
people that don't ask for any recognition for 
anything they do. And...

23:34.477 --> 23:42.462
it was all right for me to go back twice in 20 years 
let's quit there isn't that okay
