WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:12.911
As you were a new faculty member, were there any guidelines, rules, spoken or unspoken for a new faculty member?

00:15.635 --> 00:15.815
No.

00:17.357 --> 00:22.864
It was just being a new, there weren't many, of course, at any one time, and there wasn't any program for them.

00:23.364 --> 00:30.173
That's one thing that you recall we did when we were in our administrative positions as,

00:30.997 --> 00:37.549
Dean of faculties and vice president, we put this in, which I think has been a help, but we were on our own.

00:38.410 --> 00:40.834
At any one year, there weren't many of us.

00:41.796 --> 00:47.406
What hours did you assume that you were expected to be present for duty?

00:47.426 --> 00:48.588
Oh, that's easy.

00:49.490 --> 00:54.338
Monday through Friday, 8 to 5, and Saturday, 8 to 12.

00:56.883 --> 01:01.769
In addition to that, of course, if you're doing research, you're back after five.

01:01.849 --> 01:03.310
All right, let's see.

01:05.012 --> 01:14.203
Could you and your wife go to a party where alcohol was served off campus?

01:14.583 --> 01:14.944
Yeah.

01:16.906 --> 01:18.868
Okay.

01:18.888 --> 01:22.232
Could, let's see, could anybody smoke in their office?

01:22.713 --> 01:23.233
Oh, yes.

01:23.433 --> 01:26.637
Oh, yes.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.383
In fact, all of us did.

01:29.944 --> 01:31.625
Where did y'all eat lunch in those days?

01:33.027 --> 01:35.710
I lived so close to the campus that I came home.

01:35.810 --> 01:40.055
My original office and lab were in the old Animal Industry Building.

01:40.516 --> 01:46.563
The campus was not, well, you remember that it wasn't as congested by a tenth of what it is now.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.266
I could simply drive out

01:50.697 --> 01:58.574
the south side and get on Jersey and come home, and we lived the first house on Kyle Avenue.

01:59.335 --> 02:10.258
So I could just drive home for lunch, see Kitty and Steve, and then Donnie was born in 53, so I could, until they were in school, of course, I'd see them at lunch.

02:10.711 --> 02:12.735
A lot of people would go to the MSC and eat.

02:12.996 --> 02:16.583
If they were not going to leave the campus, they would go to the MSC.

02:19.008 --> 02:29.871
And if you had a very special guest that you wanted to take to lunch, you'd take them, I presume, to the MSC?

02:31.194 --> 02:31.875
Yes.

02:32.665 --> 02:35.729
I can't think of any other place we would have taken them in those days.

02:36.090 --> 02:46.844
Let's make believe that you and Kitty had a couple of dear friends, a couple that were dear friends, a married couple, that were here visiting you, and you wanted to take them out to dinner.

02:47.345 --> 02:50.549
Where would you have those early years?

02:52.492 --> 02:56.758
We're talking about before the Texan was established, which would be about, what, 1960, roughly?

02:56.798 --> 02:57.419
I think so.

03:01.424 --> 03:02.065
I don't know.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.652
I can't think.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.255
I can't think of anything out here.

03:08.415 --> 03:12.519
About the only thing I have is Hotard's Cafeteria on Main Street in downtown Bryan.

03:16.584 --> 03:19.487
Youngbloods, but I don't think I ever went there.

03:20.949 --> 03:21.970
Arnold's wouldn't have been.

03:22.490 --> 03:23.671
No, it wasn't in existence.

03:25.834 --> 03:26.955
It came along later.

03:27.728 --> 03:46.733
Let's see, oh, I remember one time Fred Benson, see if you agree with this, Fred Benson told me that he had the impression that he or any other faculty member were not to do any gambling, any playing cards for money, unless they closed the shades of the blinds.

03:47.793 --> 03:52.419
I never had that impression.

03:52.439 --> 03:55.002
I don't know whether he was teasing me or not.

03:55.022 --> 03:55.562
I don't know.

03:55.582 --> 03:56.664
This was some years ago.

03:57.224 --> 04:04.253
All right, back to, so when did, and you had some graduate students very early.

04:04.273 --> 04:16.247
Let's see, my first graduate student was, must have come in 54, something like that, for a master's.

04:17.341 --> 04:20.846
Did you recruit that student, or did he just show up?

04:21.006 --> 04:21.767
I don't remember.

04:22.088 --> 04:28.017
I certainly offered him an assistantship, and I can't remember how I met him.

04:28.537 --> 04:30.620
He's long since dead now, unfortunately.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.064
I can't remember.

04:33.164 --> 04:45.542
And then my first PhD student was Charles Wilms, who I had a recruiting

04:45.640 --> 04:54.610
channel that went to Southwest Texas and there were two or three people over there who would call me when they had a promising prospect and send them over.

04:54.650 --> 04:55.050
W.E.

04:56.131 --> 05:13.690
Norris, who had been a class ahead of me at Southwest Texas, was head of biology over there and he called and recommended this student who had taken a master's with them, bachelor's I guess from UT and master's at Southwest Texas.

05:13.889 --> 05:31.712
and turned out to be Charles Wilms who finished here, went back to Southwest Texas in the chemistry department and had a long career there serving as department head and just retired this past year.

05:32.165 --> 05:40.013
But anyhow, one thing I was impressed with, when he had not finished his thesis when he went over there, he taught four different courses.

05:40.213 --> 05:43.436
The fall that he left here, he taught four courses of chemistry.

05:44.057 --> 05:50.523
The department had assigned him that so he would familiarize himself with all these branches of chemistry, refresh his memory.

05:51.123 --> 05:56.349
But the guy wrote his dissertation in addition to that in a semester.

05:56.969 --> 06:00.973
And I don't think a week passed without my getting a chapter in the mail.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.720
Anyhow, he was my first PhD.

06:03.801 --> 06:06.584
I don't remember when my first master's came.

06:07.044 --> 06:08.346
He came in 56.

06:08.486 --> 06:09.968
Charles Williams came in 56.

06:10.388 --> 06:21.201
When did you first begin to feel that you were measuring up to the expectations that the senior faculty may have had for you as a junior colleague?

06:21.481 --> 06:25.105
I guess maybe when I got promoted in 57.

06:25.777 --> 06:27.099
Six, I guess it was.

06:27.219 --> 06:27.880
To associate.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.042
To associate professor, yeah.

06:29.282 --> 06:35.711
Did anybody give you, at the end of the first or second year, an annual evaluation?

06:35.731 --> 06:35.791
No.

06:36.212 --> 06:36.893
Comment?

06:36.993 --> 06:37.313
Never.

06:38.275 --> 06:39.897
Not in the whole 30-some-odd years.

06:41.399 --> 06:43.942
Now, did the department have regular meetings in those years?

06:44.603 --> 06:44.804
No.

06:47.628 --> 06:50.772
It was one of the loosest organizations you can conceive of.

06:50.903 --> 06:58.713
Registration then was Fieldhouse, either in G. Raleigh or at Cebiza.

07:01.216 --> 07:02.918
And you all worked?

07:02.998 --> 07:04.200
Yeah, take a shift.

07:04.320 --> 07:13.131
Now, some people like Kunkel and Couch had joint appointments with other departments, Couch and Poultry and Kunkel and Animal Science, and so they would

07:14.056 --> 07:20.328
take part of their registration assignment with those departments, but we all took a turn at registering.

07:20.709 --> 07:29.245
Was there a big, momentous research grant that you remember you got that really was a special thrill?

07:29.586 --> 07:29.927
Yes.

07:30.287 --> 07:34.275
The Robert A. Welch grant

07:35.437 --> 07:56.888
dr lyman is the lead investigator and um i guess dr james liverman and i were we we helped write the thing and but we were not listed as principal investigators later i was but that must have come about in about 57 i guess mr welch died about

07:58.623 --> 08:26.217
54 or five and left this this huge fortune to chemical research in the state of texas 25 million dollars i have no idea how how many multiples of that have already been given out in grants but it was wisely invested and it just took off and uh that was a a watershed i would say the welch grant and then later i was added as a principal investigator then still later dr lyman and i

08:26.737 --> 08:31.744
went separate ways, and I kept the old grant, he got a new one, and we did different things.

08:32.545 --> 08:37.553
With that grant, describe your primary research instances.

08:37.673 --> 08:46.045
It was on proteins and amino acids, mostly metabolism at that time, later physical characterization of enzymes,

08:46.902 --> 08:55.597
It enabled us to buy some equipment that we couldn't have got otherwise, expensive stuff that we couldn't have afforded otherwise.

08:55.617 --> 08:59.003
And your research lab was set up where?

09:00.565 --> 09:03.410
Until 57, it was in the old Animal Industry Building.

09:03.450 --> 09:08.539
Then in 57, we moved to what was known as the Herman F. Heap Building,

09:08.519 --> 09:23.517
Now, I think there are three heat buildings on campus, but it's the one across Spence Street from Animal Industries and down from the, what we used to call a pavilion.

09:23.537 --> 09:24.158
I don't know what it is.

09:24.238 --> 09:26.120
It's registration headquarters now, isn't it?

09:26.140 --> 09:26.301
Okay.

09:28.143 --> 09:29.485
And we shared it with Dairy Science.

09:29.505 --> 09:32.088
It always irritated me, and I'll put this for the record.

09:32.108 --> 09:33.069
It always irritated me.

09:33.109 --> 09:36.433
It was billed as the Dairy Biochemistry Building.

09:36.953 --> 09:46.584
and there is a discipline of dairy biochemistry, and it always irritated me that they left the and out of the designation.

09:46.905 --> 09:48.847
Was it named HEAP originally?

09:48.867 --> 10:01.442
No, it must have been named the HEAP building about, I would guess about two years later, but surely there must be a record of this, but it was just a dairy biochemistry building, and then later,

10:02.975 --> 10:16.029
You see, Mr. Heap was one of our regents and he died sometime in the late 50s I guess or around 1960 and then it must have been at about that time it was named for him.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.432
You know we used not to name buildings for living people.

10:18.512 --> 10:20.815
Right.

10:21.375 --> 10:22.517
By the way, I'll put this on the record.

10:22.537 --> 10:23.177
That's a good rule.

10:23.338 --> 10:23.778
I agree.

10:24.179 --> 10:24.599
I agree.

10:25.620 --> 10:30.045
It seems to me it would be appropriate that it

10:30.329 --> 10:36.237
I'll put in a fuzz word, normally, meaning it could be an exception, but that'd be darn good.

10:36.738 --> 10:43.307
Normally, don't name it someone unless they are deceased, or they give... A lot of money.

10:43.447 --> 10:45.811
A lot of money, and that means a huge portion.

10:45.971 --> 10:46.371
Up front.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.194
Up front, yeah.

10:48.214 --> 10:57.507
The idea of naming a building for someone in the hopes that he will then give you the money is fatuous nonsense, because once the building's named for them, they have no incentive to give you any money.

10:58.528 --> 10:58.969
That's right.

10:59.438 --> 11:04.024
Did your teaching responsibility, did it change?

11:04.304 --> 11:05.205
Were you still teaching?

11:05.446 --> 11:09.731
I taught that course for years untold, and I enjoyed it.

11:11.654 --> 11:18.983
I think that it will not be boastful to say the course had some local reputation for rigor.

11:19.030 --> 11:22.293
Did you have a nickname as far as you know?

11:22.453 --> 11:28.960
As far as I know, it may have started with an S, but no one ever called me.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.663
I don't remember ever having heard one.

11:31.683 --> 11:36.067
Well, dealing with graduate students, it's a different matter, and small numbers.

11:36.968 --> 11:41.733
And I must have started with, you know, 15 people in the course, something like that.

11:42.874 --> 11:46.017
And then when it grew to 50, I was amazed.

11:46.503 --> 11:56.790
It grew to 50, and there was a really good-looking young woman back about five rows who turned out to be the A-plus student of all of them.

11:57.491 --> 12:01.963
So change came gradually,

12:03.732 --> 12:04.954
and Shirley.

12:05.835 --> 12:06.476
All right, let's see.

12:07.237 --> 12:14.246
In the late 50s, Dr. Harrington had by then become a senior administrator.

12:14.266 --> 12:21.054
I think that he held that position at Bryan Field one year and then became dean of arts and sciences.

12:22.016 --> 12:26.401
When Dr. Brooks, I guess, retired, I think that's right.

12:27.883 --> 12:31.528
Dr. Brooks is dean of the graduate school, and I think he's also dean of arts and sciences.

12:32.150 --> 12:36.760
Dr. Harrington became dean of arts and sciences, and by the way, lived on the campus then.

12:36.780 --> 12:39.245
In that white frame house?

12:39.265 --> 12:39.546
Yes.

12:41.229 --> 12:44.817
Just south of where the MSC, it'd be the MSC parking lot, wouldn't it?

12:45.939 --> 12:46.060
Right.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.184
And then he became,

12:51.522 --> 12:56.187
Did he become dean of the college like John Paul Abbott was later?

12:56.467 --> 12:56.968
I think so.

12:56.988 --> 12:57.829
I think maybe so.

12:57.849 --> 13:05.177
Did anything change for chemistry or biochemistry that y'all could trace to his being?

13:07.139 --> 13:07.359
No.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.042
Y'all didn't get any special?

13:10.223 --> 13:11.224
No, we did not.

13:13.266 --> 13:13.847
Let's go off of that.

13:13.867 --> 13:14.748
Let me yell.

13:17.170 --> 13:21.495
Describe the administration.

13:22.083 --> 13:26.508
and its style during the 50s?

13:33.096 --> 13:40.023
Beginning at the lowest level, department heads were absolute kings of their realms.

13:40.965 --> 13:47.452
They had total authority, which can be good as well as bad, but it can be very bad too.

13:48.553 --> 13:50.115
And they...

13:51.361 --> 13:54.465
They tended to be autocratic, and many of them did.

13:54.525 --> 14:16.153
Then the deans, of course I was in agriculture, and there you realize the dean had relatively little power because so many of the people in agriculture were joint employees of the experiment station and the college, and whichever one of those entities paid the most of the person's salary had the most say in his future.

14:16.707 --> 14:24.179
The deans, I didn't have much dealings with them, many dealings with them.

14:25.300 --> 14:37.399
I do remember that Gus Watkins was a tremendously nice guy and I thought very definitely a scholar, a tremendous scholar, botanist, plant scientist.

14:37.868 --> 14:39.431
And he was my dean for a while.

14:39.531 --> 14:50.892
I did not know Dr. Adams at all, who was a soil scientist, soil physicist, and he wasn't dean for a very long time before he... Now I'm thinking about J. Boyd Page.

14:50.932 --> 14:55.641
Dr. Adams was also agronomy, but I don't remember what.

14:56.245 --> 15:15.334
uh... then the other than it got rather remote has called the there were the vice presidents in those days remember there was a dean of the college and uh... president and a chancellor the chancellorship had been inaugurated and fifty seven when the system was formed and the

15:15.314 --> 15:18.717
departments in agriculture and engineering more or less integrated.

15:19.298 --> 15:29.248
You recall or I'm sure you know that before 1947 there was say an animal husband department in the college, there was one in the experiment station, there was one in the extension service.

15:30.669 --> 15:34.633
Similarly in all of the agricultural departments.

15:34.653 --> 15:41.980
But the chancellorship then went in at that time and Mr.

15:44.963 --> 15:45.644
What was his name?

15:46.205 --> 15:46.946
The first chancellor.

15:48.889 --> 15:49.289
Oh, Gilchrist?

15:49.349 --> 15:52.073
Mr. Gilchrist was a remote figure.

15:52.434 --> 15:54.036
I don't think I ever met him, really, even.

15:55.198 --> 15:59.965
Were there ever school faculty meetings?

16:02.108 --> 16:02.408
Yes.

16:03.530 --> 16:10.380
In agriculture, we would occasionally have a faculty meeting, and the dean would be...

16:10.681 --> 16:17.252
presiding or maybe the director of the experiment station or someone would at least be there to speak probably.

16:17.953 --> 16:22.481
Dr. Lewis was for a long time the director of the experiment station.

16:22.541 --> 16:22.821
R.D.

16:23.062 --> 16:23.182
Lewis.

16:23.202 --> 16:23.362
R.D.

16:23.402 --> 16:24.124
Lewis, uh-huh.

16:24.865 --> 16:29.993
And he was, I believe his background was agronomy, I'm not sure.

16:30.114 --> 16:36.925
He was a native of, I believe, Ohio,

16:37.883 --> 16:39.965
and had had considerable experience there.

16:40.185 --> 16:44.349
I got personally acquainted with Dr. Lewis and got along fine with him.

16:45.170 --> 16:51.355
There was one thing that you had to get permission to go to the research foundation for a grant.

16:52.356 --> 16:56.199
And this particularly became sticky after overhead went into effect.

16:56.980 --> 17:02.565
I have the distinction of having the first grant to the College of Agriculture where overhead was charged.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.848
And that was a decision not

17:06.115 --> 17:09.585
from the experiment station, but from the system.

17:09.865 --> 17:12.934
My grand approval came through Dr. Lewis.

17:15.019 --> 17:18.910
I may have been in the office to talk to Vic Schimber, who is the associate director

17:19.227 --> 17:27.977
And Dr. Lewis called me into his office, which is next door, and said, you've got approval from the NIH for your NIH grant has been approved by the system.

17:27.997 --> 17:31.521
It says subject to 15% overhead and so forth.

17:31.542 --> 17:33.404
He said, I said, we don't charge overheads.

17:33.424 --> 17:36.688
That must mean subject to not more than 15% being taken out.

17:36.708 --> 17:41.513
But don't worry about, sure enough, it was taken out.

17:42.154 --> 17:45.538
And I had not put, I had not calculated it in my grant.

17:45.856 --> 17:53.427
And I later had words with my friend Mr. Calvin Ray Guest about this, who was the auditor who recommended that we start charging.

17:54.268 --> 17:56.271
At the system level?

17:56.451 --> 17:57.273
At the system level.

18:00.017 --> 18:07.948
And I presume down through the years that has been one of the items of contention

18:08.772 --> 18:10.595
about where that money then goes.

18:10.615 --> 18:11.216
Absolutely.

18:11.717 --> 18:17.547
When I was dean of science, that was the hardest nut I ever tried to crack and then never did crack it.

18:17.967 --> 18:19.750
It started out at 15%, you said.

18:20.972 --> 18:22.114
That's what this one was.

18:22.154 --> 18:24.378
That's what it meant.

18:24.398 --> 18:24.498
Yeah.

18:24.518 --> 18:27.523
And eventually got to be how much over the years?

18:27.892 --> 18:32.981
I think probably the most common thing was 40% of salaries and wages.

18:33.001 --> 18:34.925
That's what I thought.

18:34.945 --> 18:37.129
This was 15% of the total.

18:37.850 --> 18:44.061
Now, there was never a campus-wide faculty meeting, was there, in those early years?

18:44.665 --> 18:56.959
The only ones I can recall were the ones where the Distinguished Achievement Awards were made, and that must have started about in the mid or late 50s, I can't recall, something like that.

18:56.999 --> 19:00.223
And those were the only ones I recall, general faculty meetings.

19:01.304 --> 19:09.373
Do you remember any reaction, you and your colleagues, when Earl Rudder became the chief executive officer of the institution?

19:10.568 --> 19:23.643
There were probably a lot of remarks about his military background and about his lack of academic preparation, I think.

19:23.683 --> 19:29.349
That probably was one of the things that you could hear.

19:29.389 --> 19:38.639
I'm assuming that y'all faculty, typical faculty in those years, didn't see nor hear much directly from board members.

19:39.480 --> 19:40.221
Oh, no.

19:40.522 --> 19:42.063
The board of directors came and went?

19:42.143 --> 19:42.864
They came and went.

19:42.884 --> 19:48.129
I think the first time I ever saw them was when they had me in to approve me for a dean of science.

19:50.391 --> 19:54.634
And by the way, in those days, the meetings were not open.

19:54.695 --> 20:05.864
There was a campus policeman at the door, and you went in when you were invited, and when your turn came, the policeman opened the door and ushered you in.

20:06.285 --> 20:06.405
Right.

20:06.425 --> 20:09.988
In the 60s, Mr. Rudder, his president,

20:09.968 --> 20:11.550
Board meetings were held where?

20:12.271 --> 20:18.840
In the old board of directors' residence, the old wooden frame building across the side street from Beza Hall.

20:20.342 --> 20:22.465
And that's where they spent the night?

20:22.485 --> 20:23.446
They stayed there.

20:23.466 --> 20:29.955
They had rooms, and it was a fairly large house, two or three stories.

20:29.975 --> 20:32.858
Mrs. Cashin was their hostess.

20:32.959 --> 20:36.964
And then there was the front and the second story in the front.

20:36.984 --> 20:39.267
There was a large room, and that was the board meeting room.

20:39.854 --> 20:43.820
Did you have any interaction with President Erl Rudder?

20:46.004 --> 20:48.688
Not until I became Dean of Science.

20:48.708 --> 20:49.669
When was that?

20:49.690 --> 20:50.210
1970.

20:51.673 --> 21:05.254
Well, casually, I remember one time I was showing a prospective faculty member through the system building and happened to come face to face with him

21:06.010 --> 21:10.114
there at the stairs, and I introduced him to the prospective faculty member.

21:10.134 --> 21:12.556
I said, now, Mr. Rudder, I'm Mac Prescott.

21:12.576 --> 21:15.378
He said, yes, I know at our house you're known as Kitty's husband.

21:17.881 --> 21:27.289
But then when I, Dr. Byers is the one who called me over and talked to me about becoming Dean of Science.

21:27.309 --> 21:28.911
And then he and I went to see Mr. Rudder.

21:28.971 --> 21:33.655
All right, as far as you know, how did you get identified

21:34.630 --> 21:39.375
by Byers or whomever for that task?

21:40.797 --> 21:59.237
Somehow my curriculum vitae made its way to Dr. Byers and he saw a respectable number of publications, a respectable number of grants through the years and it may have been passed to him by

22:01.478 --> 22:03.182
somebody else in the administration.

22:06.912 --> 22:14.070
My curriculum vitae would have been on file in Dr. Suttle's office, for example, who handled research grants.

22:14.337 --> 22:24.048
And Dr. Byers was evidently impressed that it looked like I was really a scientist, and so he decided he would talk to me about becoming Dean.

22:24.128 --> 22:26.631
Now, he was a very highly regarded scholar nationally.

22:26.651 --> 22:27.072
Oh, yes.

22:27.332 --> 22:28.754
He was a member of the National Academy.

22:28.834 --> 22:30.035
Come from Chicago?

22:30.415 --> 22:33.579
He came from the University of Chicago.

22:33.619 --> 22:36.703
He had graduated at Berkeley.

22:37.784 --> 22:40.547
Now, who preceded you as Dean of Science?

22:41.911 --> 22:46.055
Dr. Byers was acting for about a year and a half, I believe.

22:46.135 --> 22:51.580
I can't remember who, but Clarence Zener had been the first dean of science, a very distinguished mathematical physicist.

22:52.141 --> 22:58.367
So that in a way, this is moving you organizationally from agriculture... Into science.

22:58.387 --> 22:59.328
...into science.

22:59.348 --> 23:00.289
Correct, yeah.

23:00.309 --> 23:03.973
At my request, I kept my professorship in biochemistry.

23:04.153 --> 23:06.675
And there was no search committee... No.

23:06.695 --> 23:08.077
...in those days.

23:08.097 --> 23:09.338
It was Dr. Byers.

23:09.458 --> 23:09.538
Yes.

23:09.518 --> 23:15.208
Do you remember anything when he invited you over?

23:15.248 --> 23:19.676
Did you know what the conversation was going to be about?

23:19.696 --> 23:29.113
Dr. Suttle had called and said, Dr. Byers wants to talk to you and don't let on that I've let you know this.

23:30.022 --> 23:38.295
It's about becoming dean of science, which shocked me that I'm sure Dr. Byers wouldn't have recognized me.

23:38.535 --> 23:40.258
You had been department head?

23:40.278 --> 23:40.979
Department head.

23:41.560 --> 23:41.820
For how long?

23:41.840 --> 23:45.626
Oh, I've been acting for a year and head for a year, something like that.

23:45.646 --> 23:46.447
So not long?

23:46.527 --> 23:48.410
Not long, yeah.

23:48.430 --> 23:55.241
And I presume you had not made anybody, you had not indicated anybody that you wanted to be an administrator.

23:55.321 --> 23:55.962
No.

23:55.942 --> 23:59.266
because you, I have the impression you thoroughly enjoyed your research.

24:01.489 --> 24:11.921
When you then met with Dr. Byers, do you remember, did you feel you were being interviewed, that you were being measured?

24:14.024 --> 24:14.224
No.

24:14.885 --> 24:16.667
I had the feeling he was going to offer me the job.

24:17.648 --> 24:20.852
He said, now as you know,

24:22.790 --> 24:31.040
The deanship of science has been open and said, there's been a move on to attract some really prominent scientists there.

24:31.060 --> 24:36.045
In fact, I knew that they tried, I think that they'd offered the job to Christian Anfinson at the NIH.

24:36.085 --> 24:37.967
He was a Nobel laureate and so forth.

24:38.808 --> 24:41.371
And he said, but this thing doesn't work out.

24:41.411 --> 24:51.463
And sometimes I like it's better for us to look among our own people and said, I've looked at your record and said, you've done very well.

24:51.832 --> 24:55.896
You're one of the real scientists over there in agriculture.

24:57.198 --> 24:59.861
We may need to strike that, but that's what he said.

24:59.961 --> 25:05.867
And so he said, just want you to talk to Mr. Rudder about becoming dean of science.

25:06.027 --> 25:08.290
Did he take you over too?

25:09.331 --> 25:12.014
Either then or shortly thereafter.

25:12.595 --> 25:14.777
Was it a one-on-one with Mr. Rudder?

25:14.797 --> 25:16.339
No, but Dr. Byers was there too.

25:16.739 --> 25:20.303
And what was the nature of Mr. Rudder's?

25:21.143 --> 25:40.549
He just wanted to be sure that I was going to push to the best of my ability to make the science college an outstanding organization, that I was not going to let the wild people in any department run me, which I don't believe they ever did.

25:41.691 --> 25:44.835
Did he give you any guidelines?

25:45.055 --> 25:50.222
No, and I thought it over and I called Dr. Byers and said, I don't believe I want to do this.

25:51.468 --> 25:55.373
And Dr. Byers said, meet me Mr. Rudders at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

25:57.776 --> 26:03.363
So we walked in and Mr. Rudders said, sit down here, Mac.

26:04.644 --> 26:06.086
Do you remember how his desk was?

26:06.286 --> 26:07.788
There was a chair right at the end of his desk.

26:07.808 --> 26:08.269
Sit down here.

26:08.890 --> 26:13.615
He said, now, Mac, we've already passed this juncture of whether you're going to be deemed science.

26:13.896 --> 26:14.476
We're past that.

26:14.977 --> 26:18.201
Now, what are you going to do about those people over in so-and-so and so-and-so?

26:19.143 --> 26:30.295
And I said, well, Mr. Rudder, if I have the backing, I said, those people in physics got, and I named a prominent physicist and administrator, I said, those people got him.

26:30.515 --> 26:33.178
And there are people like that in every department.

26:33.418 --> 26:37.702
And so I just want to be sure that I'm going to have the, he said, no, no, he got himself.

26:37.983 --> 26:44.309
But he said, I just want to be sure that I've got your backing, the backing of the central administration to do whatever I need to do over there.

26:45.891 --> 26:46.331
You've got it?

26:47.693 --> 26:48.053
OK.

26:49.535 --> 26:52.683
We'll take you before the board at the next meeting.

26:54.387 --> 26:57.895
Does the board ask any questions?

26:58.316 --> 27:00.201
They said, tell us about yourself.

27:00.221 --> 27:00.782
Where are you from?

27:01.183 --> 27:01.845
Who do you marry?

27:02.306 --> 27:03.128
How many kids do you have?

27:04.331 --> 27:04.692
That was it.

27:06.140 --> 27:09.924
Let's back up and talk about Andy Suttle.

27:10.445 --> 27:14.029
He came under Mr. Rutter as vice president?

27:14.049 --> 27:15.090
Vice president for research.

27:16.431 --> 27:18.373
Do you know who identified him?

27:18.834 --> 27:31.928
Well, I strongly suspect that the Welch Foundation, Mr. Dr. Milligan, Dr. W. Milligan, was the scientific director of the Welch Foundation.

27:32.498 --> 27:40.007
And I've always had the impression somehow that he highly recommended Dr. Sutton.

27:40.067 --> 27:43.611
And what was his primary function as vice president for research?

27:44.052 --> 28:02.033
Apparently, the best I can tell to review grad applications as they went out, I suppose to keep in contact with the National Science Foundation and people of that

28:02.367 --> 28:24.139
Sort I never did really understand the nature of the position and when Jack Williams came in he said I have no Place in my organization that belongs under the vice president for academic affairs and I agree with that organization so I know I was never really clear except that he was another hurdle in the

28:25.216 --> 28:28.902
in the obstacle race to get it off campus when you're doing a proposal.

28:29.263 --> 28:34.132
And don't I remember that he had one of his many eccentricities was wearing two watches?

28:34.152 --> 28:36.516
Two watches and he wrote in green ink.

28:37.938 --> 28:40.282
Yeah, yeah.

28:40.302 --> 28:45.351
And those of us over in the humanities I remember one day were very, very enraged

28:45.331 --> 29:02.260
He lectured to us as a big faculty group over in the chemistry lecture hall that the first way you measure the quality of research is how much money does it bring in, that non-sponsored research

29:02.881 --> 29:04.705
isn't worth anything.

29:05.507 --> 29:06.770
That doesn't surprise me.

29:06.790 --> 29:09.056
In history, that bothered us a great deal.

29:09.076 --> 29:11.221
Yeah, I can see that in my... Let's see.

29:12.945 --> 29:14.950
Wayne Hall.

29:15.211 --> 29:20.704
Describe your view of him as the chief academic officer under Mr. Rutter.

29:20.684 --> 29:28.536
Oh, Wayne and I were Indians together, and he got to be a chief fairly young in life, but I'd always had good relations with Wayne.

29:28.556 --> 29:43.559
He'd come out of plant science, and matter of fact, I believe he won the first research award from the Association of Former Students and didn't even have an experiment station appointment, which tells you how good he must have been at getting money and getting the research out.

29:43.980 --> 29:48.126
Wayne and I always had excellent rapport, no difficulty there.

29:48.308 --> 29:58.328
And I have the impression that in a quiet manner one-on-one, Earl Rudder would listen to Wayne Hall about academic matters.

29:58.348 --> 29:59.951
Oh, I think there's no doubt about that.

29:59.971 --> 30:06.003
I think that Wayne had a great influence on Mr. Rudder.

30:07.205 --> 30:08.207
All right.

30:08.980 --> 30:15.328
Great changes made in Mr. Rutter's early years of coeducation, voluntary corps, and so forth.

30:16.008 --> 30:18.872
Were you at all involved in that century study?

30:20.033 --> 30:23.017
Were you on any of the committees that made any recommendations?

30:25.279 --> 30:25.920
I don't recall.

30:27.142 --> 30:31.987
What was your, you and your colleagues, what was your reaction at these proposed changes?

30:34.470 --> 30:37.654
My general feeling is that

30:38.765 --> 30:43.232
that they were widely approved.

30:43.853 --> 30:49.681
The idea of coeducation, compulsory cohort being terminated I think was a very popular decision.

30:49.922 --> 30:51.644
That may have been made before Mr. Rudder came.

30:51.664 --> 30:52.365
I can't remember.

30:52.385 --> 30:52.646
No, no.

30:52.746 --> 30:53.206
It was not.

30:53.827 --> 30:55.450
I remember very much.

30:56.571 --> 30:57.493
You were here already.

30:57.513 --> 31:07.067
I wrote the first draft and I remember getting back from Wayne Hall the copy with Mr. Rudder's candid comments in the margin and some of them were very strong.

31:07.773 --> 31:13.041
and Hall asked me to take it, revise it, bring it in line with Mr. Rudder's comments.

31:13.679 --> 31:17.803
And I go back two days later and said, sir, I cannot in good faith make many of these.

31:17.903 --> 31:18.643
And he said, why?

31:18.984 --> 31:23.648
And I said, because the committee really believes these are our subjective opinions.

31:23.708 --> 31:29.633
We may be in error, but we really believe that coeducation, voluntary core, and so forth is in order.

31:30.594 --> 31:35.719
And he said, I'll stake my job on your right to say what the committee really believes.

31:37.721 --> 31:38.081
Let's see.

31:38.181 --> 31:41.484
Okay, then back to your beginning as dean.

31:42.525 --> 31:43.686
And that's what year?

31:44.020 --> 31:46.273
1970, yeah.

31:46.293 --> 31:48.867
The board met in November of 69.
