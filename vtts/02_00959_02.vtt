WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:11.204
During

00:01.988 --> 00:11.204
the war, did you ever have an experience where it 
seemed like one particular man was trying to kill

00:01.988 --> 00:11.204
you? Every time I had a bullet shot at me, I thought 
they were shooting at me personally. No, no, I

00:18.276 --> 00:19.498
never. I felt they were all shooting. at people. 
It's an old joke that went along out there. You're

00:26.548 --> 00:28.811
not worried about the bullet with your name on it. 
You're worried about the bullet that says, to whom

00:28.851 --> 00:32.257
it may concern, is the one you have to be worried 
about. That's an old joke. But, no, what scared

00:33.398 --> 00:43.354
you, what scared me a lot, was you'd be sitting 
right next to a person, or laying next to a person.

00:43.374 --> 00:47.641
You're firing at the enemy, and you can't see, and 
they can't see you half the time. Then, he gets hit,

00:48.682 --> 00:51.807
and he's no more than two feet away from you. And it 
kind of, afterwards, all over, he'd say, God, if I

00:52.478 --> 00:57.265
was just two feet over, he would have gotten me. You 
know, and it makes it weird. Or you're in an area and

00:59.308 --> 01:04.915
mortars are coming in, and a mortar hits another 
guy's hole where he's sitting. He'd say, God, what

01:04.935 --> 01:10.944
if I was, if that mortar came, if the guy just held 
the mortar an inch higher, that would hit my hole,

01:04.935 --> 01:10.944
you know. I never thought of him shooting directly 
at me, but he was weird. During the space of the

01:17.052 --> 01:21.118
conflict, under the stresses, Was there ever a 
situation where there was one specific man or you

01:21.487 --> 01:31.357
lost control and you wanted to get one guy or get 
anyone you could get after what had just happened?

01:34.500 --> 01:35.561
Yeah.

01:40.886 --> 01:50.515
The problem, you get so frustrated at times, 
especially when your best friend there gets shot

01:40.886 --> 01:50.515
or wounded or hurt or dies. You won't take it out on 
anybody. If I had the Vietnamese you hate after a

01:52.977 --> 01:56.382
while. But that's at first. I don't remember ever 
getting super mad to kill someone because, like a

02:00.047 --> 02:10.242
colonel or even somebody in our own unit or the 
enemy. I would love to get a hold of them a lot of

02:11.143 --> 02:12.726
times. I wish, a lot of times you kind of wish we 
could have just nuked North Vietnam. That's about

02:18.574 --> 02:21.058
as angry as I got toward a person. No one 
individually or one person in particular. How was

02:26.702 --> 02:28.645
the psychology of the war on you? There are many 
Vietnam veterans who feel like the VC were like

02:28.785 --> 02:34.752
shadows, unable to be hunted down. They would be 
able to live off the land, bearing hardships, and

02:35.313 --> 02:39.499
then they could move in and out. How did this affect 
you, and how do you think that the ability of the

02:40.200 --> 02:49.071
superior technology, the Americans, affected 
the VC mentality or the NBA mentality? I never saw

02:49.962 --> 02:53.486
the VC. The part of country I was in was the I Corps, 
which was North Vietnamese regular.

03:04.878 --> 03:10.604
The way that the Vietnamese, the catches they had 
now, we were totally superior to the Vietnamese. I

03:10.624 --> 03:11.465
still believe that. The military, when I was 
there, was very highly trained. They were there to

03:16.410 --> 03:19.193
do a job, and they could have. I feel the main 
problem, again, is going back to politics, the

03:19.662 --> 03:28.693
idea that we could not shoot into certain areas. 
And they knew that. Before we caught in a fire

03:30.034 --> 03:34.960
support, we had to get, there's red areas, areas 
you could not fire into. So they would say, sorry,

03:35.581 --> 03:39.005
you've got to move out some to shoot in that area. 
But you're under fire. You can't do that. They also

03:41.688 --> 03:43.610
knew they could get into a temple. A temple area 
starts shooting at you, but you can't shoot back. I

03:50.155 --> 03:51.297
did not like that. If I was a general head of the 
press, the first thing I would do is kick all the

03:51.797 --> 03:58.407
press out of Vietnam. That made another problem. 
We couldn't do certain things. We couldn't go into

04:02.634 --> 04:03.956
certain areas. We could not ask questions the way 
we would like to get information from the enemy.

04:10.626 --> 04:11.487
They were shadows. Of course, I got off the 
tangent. I didn't even do that. They had catches. I

04:17.816 --> 04:19.639
don't think they were any more superior I think a 
lot of people put their ideas way above what they

04:20.497 --> 04:25.722
really were. They had things put away. They had a 
distribution area right on the other side of the

04:27.203 --> 04:36.933
DMZ when we were up at, we call it Big Rock. It is a 
place where we watched the Vietnamese on the other

04:38.714 --> 04:42.958
side of the DMZ. They were there. There's a staging 
area. It's a staging camp. I don't know how they

04:48.307 --> 04:49.429
worked there. I don't know if they came down, 
stayed a couple of weeks or a couple of months, and

04:49.469 --> 04:58.341
moved back up into staging area, or they stayed 
their entire time down into I-Corps. I don't know.

05:01.465 --> 05:02.606
But I don't think they were that good. I feel that 
they knew the jungle. We didn't. They had certain

05:05.931 --> 05:06.892
areas. They controlled the jungle. We didn't. We 
controlled the cities. They controlled

05:10.557 --> 05:12.379
everything else. We would go out on patrol. We 
would look for them. They'll hit us. Then we'll run

05:15.205 --> 05:19.011
back to the city, or go back, not run, but go back to 
the city. But they controlled and held the

05:19.031 --> 05:21.114
jungles. They held the rice paddies. They held the 
farms. We fought the war totally wrong. I blame,

05:26.943 --> 05:31.630
again, politics and our State Department for 
that. Scorched earth. Scorched earth was a great

05:34.114 --> 05:35.837
idea. They used the wrong chemicals to do that. 
Again, if I was a smart man, I would not be a school

05:39.877 --> 05:42.840
teacher. I would have been a general somewhere. 
But they should have, if they would have gotten rid

05:44.701 --> 05:53.369
of the jungle, the

05:44.701 --> 05:53.369
CIA or the people, his intelligence, his advisors 
were right. Get rid of the jungle. They have no

05:54.810 --> 05:55.791
place to hide. But how they did it was totally 
wrong. And it didn't work at that. They stopped

06:00.735 --> 06:05.339
using Agent Orange because it did not fulfill what 
they wanted to do. They would have had to,

06:05.399 --> 06:08.382
whatever, I don't know, burn it down. How should we 
have fought the war? Nuke it. No, I'm kidding. I

06:13.777 --> 06:14.018
don't. We could have tried out one of our new bombs 
on it to say it accidentally fell out of the

06:15.179 --> 06:18.542
airplane.

06:21.845 --> 06:36.560
If we would have fought the war properly, that's 
hard because if I say we fought the war properly,

06:21.845 --> 06:36.560
the first thing we should have done is gotten rid of 
the entire government, the corruption going on in

06:21.845 --> 06:36.560
the system, which is not the military's problem. 
The military doesn't go in and say, General, we

06:38.433 --> 06:41.496
don't like your president. We don't like the way 
your government is. Get rid of it, and then we'll

06:44.500 --> 06:46.862
fight for you. The military has to go in when the 
president tells them to. I just feel that State

06:50.466 --> 06:57.033
Department blew it, and they tried to make the Army 
be blamed for it. And that's totally wrong. It

06:58.155 --> 06:59.176
wasn't their fault. Get rid of the corruption 
first, and then you might have a chance. The people

07:03.340 --> 07:07.545
then would have respected us a little more or their 
own government. They would have taken pride in

07:09.197 --> 07:10.579
their own country. They didn't care. They were so 
corrupt. Who would want to take pride in a country

07:12.240 --> 07:14.303
that's corrupt? I remember from your previous 
lectures at the high school here, you said that

07:15.344 --> 07:21.891
most Vietnamese were just neutral. They cared 
about their rice paddy. Yeah. The farming area was

07:24.454 --> 07:25.995
that way. I noticed the guys... I go back to 1954 
when Dinh Dinh Phu happened. They were set up by the

07:35.826 --> 07:37.988
U.N., North Vietnam and South Vietnam, they will 
take and say, okay, anybody that wants to be

07:38.677 --> 07:45.226
communist, you know, go north, south, same way. 
They did that in Korea, but the Korean had a

07:45.466 --> 07:50.213
different philosophy toward life than the 
Vietnamese. Totally different type of people,

07:50.313 --> 07:53.137
but they thought it would work that way. These 
Vietnamese believed their land was very

07:53.517 --> 07:56.762
important to them. They didn't care what 
government they had. They just wanted to make

07:58.163 --> 08:04.532
their rice or whatever they grew and live a very 
happy life. They might have, they believed and

08:04.850 --> 08:07.374
they loved Ho Chi Minh. Ho Chi Minh was a great hero 
to these people. We, on the other hand, did not like

08:10.258 --> 08:15.766
Ho Chi Minh because he was the bad guy to us. And it 
made it difficult because these, I believe that's

08:16.587 --> 08:20.794
who the VC were. Well, I know that's who they were. I 
didn't see it again. We're talking just by hearing

08:24.399 --> 08:34.654
other people that were in two corps, three corps, 
and especially four corps, that they, at night,

08:35.292 --> 08:41.182
They'd get out a gun, shoot one American, hide the 
gun, and back right into his field. He did not like

08:41.382 --> 08:43.465
Americans. Not that he didn't like us. He did not 
want us there. He wanted that to be one country

08:46.831 --> 08:48.714
again. We were there stopping his country from 
being unified. They're not a very smart people.

08:55.605 --> 08:56.126
They're farmers. They're just regular people. 
They just want to be left alone. We wouldn't. And

09:00.754 --> 09:02.076
they did not like us for that. So would you consider 
the American influence, in addition to the fact

09:03.507 --> 09:14.340
that the South is so corrupt, a major contribution 
to the resistance that would grow as long as the

09:03.507 --> 09:14.340
Americans were there? I think that they believed 
the Americans, which it was, that the Americans

09:14.901 --> 09:22.991
caused the corruption, caused the collapse of 
respect for themselves. And I believe the

09:23.211 --> 09:28.057
Americans did cause that.

09:28.077 --> 09:30.780
The last I heard, the Vietnam War is still going on. 
They just change sides every so often. Different

09:33.620 --> 09:35.061
people try to take over. South Vietnam, China now, 
I heard, is trying again to take over. It's an area

09:39.265 --> 09:41.447
that is continuous. Whoever's fighting will 
always fight for Vietnam. Your

09:43.869 --> 09:46.371
great-great-grandchildren might be there 
again. I hope not, but it could happen. What is your

09:49.253 --> 09:51.495
strongest memory about Vietnam? Bleeding. No, 
no. The

09:53.237 --> 09:57.460
strongest memory. USO shows. Dirty

10:01.051 --> 10:07.920
8mm films that we somehow got in there. R&R. I don't 
remember too much about R&Rs, except I've got a lot

10:09.843 --> 10:14.409
of pictures out of focus.

10:17.392 --> 10:18.334
Let's see. The guys that I hung around with. Things 
like that. The bad parts of Vietnam, I don't want to

10:23.461 --> 10:26.846
remember. It's not that I'm trying to blot them 
out. It's just they were bad parts. Vietnam to me

10:30.891 --> 10:36.959
was three years of my life that I grew up with. I have 
a lot of respect for the military because I grew up

10:36.979 --> 10:44.310
there, and I thought that I owed the military 
something. So that's why anything to do with the

10:44.330 --> 10:48.115
military today, I believe it should be stronger. I 
think boot camps should be ten times harder than

10:48.135 --> 10:52.000
what they have today because... i know what i had to 
go through some of the dumbest things in the world

10:52.418 --> 11:20.198
but again it it helped me understand myself by 
doing these dumb things looking back at the time

10:52.418 --> 11:20.198
it's just stupid but looking back it really helped 
me um the the friendliness of the military

10:52.418 --> 11:20.198
sometimes and you also you got the quacks in there 
you got the kooks uh the poker games the uh short

10:52.418 --> 11:20.198
sheets you've got all that uh putting salt in the 
shower heads uh just all kind of things that they

11:21.022 --> 11:47.282
would do to you and of course you do it back to them uh 
meeting other guys i but the killing in the at that

11:21.022 --> 11:47.282
part i don't like to remember too much of i just like 
to forget that some guys that that's all they live

11:21.022 --> 11:47.282
for is to say how bad it was in vietnam and it was 
pretty bad but then again i try to remember the fun

11:21.022 --> 11:47.282
parts the uh hill ford isn't it's not as bad i can't i 
have a fond memory not of vietnam but of the

11:21.022 --> 11:47.282
camaraderie So there was a strong feeling of even 
family between the two? Oh, yeah, yeah. Some

11:53.688 --> 11:55.269
people got very, very close. I have a friend that we 
became super, super, super close. We went on one

12:00.034 --> 12:02.777
R&R together. As we can say, as we would have said 
together, between us two, we were arrested in

12:03.698 --> 12:11.045
every country we went to. Drug and disorderly, of 
course, but then what they'd do is As a military,

12:14.836 --> 12:18.742
they'd say, okay, sober up, and we say we promise. 
And they said, don't get drunk again, we promise.

12:21.966 --> 12:25.251
You know, they let us go, and a couple hours, we're 
back there again, you know, saying the same thing.

12:25.632 --> 12:35.566
But again, it's a place to blow off steam and take 
total obnoxious people out of ourselves for a few

12:25.632 --> 12:35.566
hours or a few days. Again, all pictures were 
almost, most of them are out of focus, and that only

12:36.568 --> 12:42.396
shows me how great of a time I had, I guess. In 
Richard Nixon's book, No More Vietnam... Who's

12:43.709 --> 12:47.333
he? Okay, I'm sorry. He claims that we actually won 
the war physically, and then we let the South fall

12:48.394 --> 12:55.462
when we decided to cut aid. Cut aid after we brought 
our troops out, the major forces. We cut aid

13:00.928 --> 13:03.070
through congressional action. That's 
physically how we really lost the war. I don't

13:05.053 --> 13:06.734
believe that. I believe Richard Nixon... Now, 
this is hindsight. I could be wrong on this, but

13:11.079 --> 13:13.682
this is what I've heard before from... either 
Channel 8 or one of these weird channels that I

13:14.455 --> 13:42.977
watch, educational channels, that was talking to 
either the ambassador or one of the top-ranking

13:14.455 --> 13:42.977
members of North Vietnam at the time about the 
bombing, a Christmas bombing, where they said,

13:14.455 --> 13:42.977
when solid thunder rolled over, those names, the 
OB-52, you hear about that, I know these huge

13:14.455 --> 13:42.977
terminology, but when they said the B-52s came 
over Hanoi, During Christmas, during that time

13:43.953 --> 13:48.097
period, Nixon was, you know, letting bomb it. They 
were told, one more day, we can't handle it

13:49.578 --> 13:52.661
anymore. North Vietnam was to its knees.

14:00.007 --> 14:06.213
The Christmas, there's a tremendous protest a few 
days before Christmas saying, Richard Nixon,

14:00.007 --> 14:06.213
you've got to stop bombing. How cruel of you to bomb 
on Christmas Day. Remember, Hanoi, they don't

14:08.915 --> 14:10.977
have Christmas. You know, they have their other 
booths. They have tests, which they blow the hell

14:12.809 --> 14:15.954
out of us on their holidays, you know. But we 
weren't going to do it to them. And they had a

14:18.377 --> 14:20.981
gigantic protest against Richard Nixon. Richard 
Nixon backed down on Christmas Eve, and they said,

14:21.001 --> 14:28.131
Christmas Eve, if they bomb one more day, we'll sue 
for peace. We can't handle those B-52s. And he

14:29.673 --> 14:31.856
stopped. And people have said, at that point, if he 
would have bombed one more day, the war would have

14:32.738 --> 14:39.247
been over with. I don't believe him. saying that 
Congress stopped it. This war never had a chance.

14:44.591 --> 14:50.939
You couldn't have won the war with 500,000 more, 
another million men in that country, because

14:44.591 --> 14:50.939
everything was corrupt. We're playing politics. 
If they would have gotten everybody out of there,

14:52.641 --> 15:00.271
got the press out and said, okay, Army, fight a war, 
it would take about a year. But, of course, there

15:00.892 --> 15:05.217
wouldn't have been very many people left alive, 
but they would have fought the war. Again, I feel

15:05.278 --> 15:08.702
sorry for the military generals that were there 
because it's embarrassing. They should have,

15:12.292 --> 15:13.813
they had the war won. And politics messed

15:15.836 --> 15:19.840
up. What was your opinion of the anti-war 
demonstrators? One of the problems I feel that

15:22.884 --> 15:28.050
lost the war. We've already talked about the 
military. I don't blame the military for this

15:32.054 --> 15:33.676
problem. I blame the State Department and the 
politicians. Also, I look back What lost the

15:37.707 --> 15:46.698
Vietnam War, we the Vietnamese should really go to 
and say, thank you very much, and North Vietnam

15:37.707 --> 15:46.698
should say, thank you very much, were the 
protesters. I think that politicians were afraid

15:47.118 --> 15:54.447
of what was happening by high school, college, 
especially college students. No one wants to die.

15:55.548 --> 15:56.830
No one wanted to go to Vietnam. We were wrong. 
Politicians were wrong. But I think the

16:00.915 --> 16:04.679
protesters did more harm than anything. I'm not 
saying that protesting was wrong. I think in this

16:07.897 --> 16:12.201
situation, I guess, we were wrong from the start. 
And looking back, I'm saying, thank God we did have

16:13.403 --> 16:22.492
protesters, because we might still be in Vietnam 
fighting with a corrupt organization, a corrupt

16:13.403 --> 16:22.492
government still fighting that war. But I blame, 
or I'd say that a lot of help for the end of the

16:23.073 --> 16:30.320
Vietnam War was protesters. You're a veteran, and 
you retired. the war was still going on. Right.

16:33.822 --> 16:41.690
What was your impression of the media coverage 
that was going on in the States because of your own

16:33.822 --> 16:41.690
frame of reference you would have as a veteran of 
the same conflict? I dislike it. I think a lot of the

16:42.550 --> 16:47.835
problems of the war, the military messed up on 
that. The military did wrong, badly on that. I

16:50.057 --> 16:52.539
mean, you can never say the military did something 
wrong. They put a Dan Rather in Vietnam, not just

16:52.900 --> 16:58.124
one man, talking about in general. What they did in 
Grenada, or Grenada, is what they should have

17:02.504 --> 17:03.825
done. After they have the battles, and they say, 
these are the pictures we want to show you. We'll

17:07.749 --> 17:08.670
take the pictures. We'll give you. Whenever a 
person can wake up in the morning, or wake up, go to

17:09.491 --> 17:25.246
work, rush home at 6 o'clock in the evening, turn on 
Dan Rather or someone with CBS News saying, today,

17:09.491 --> 17:25.246
2,000 men were injured, 500 were killed. They 
don't realize that after a while, you get numb.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.493
You're saying, my God, look how many people are 
dying. And you You start your own, and your morale

17:32.170 --> 17:36.215
goes way down. The American public's morale has to 
die. You're watching guys, you know, dirty. I

17:41.503 --> 17:49.874
would go out for 60 days at times, and sometimes go 
out on patrol, hit a sweep or an operation, and I

17:41.503 --> 17:49.874
might be out for 60 days. I've not come in. I'm not 
taking a bath. I had the same clothes on for 60 days.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.782
I stink. Some guy takes a picture of me, you know, 
saying, hi, are you having fun in Vietnam? You

17:59.823 --> 18:01.045
know, they say, fuck you. You know, we don't have 
anything to do with that guy. But that's what they

18:04.589 --> 18:06.831
showed on television. Dan Rather walked up to a guy 
on patrol being shot at saying, hi, are you having

18:06.851 --> 18:10.675
fun here? Morality, you know, morale just dropped 
to, you know, zilch at that time. But in World War

18:15.661 --> 18:18.044
II, the same thing happened. If they would have 
gone to Iwo Jima and said, hey, are we having fun

18:18.064 --> 18:20.707
here? You know, they would have gotten shot. That 
is the difference. They did not come out and say,

18:23.626 --> 18:28.514
20,000 men were killed today in Iwo Jima. Tomorrow 
might be 40,000 more. That, I think, destroyed the

18:31.159 --> 18:32.741
war. The morale of the United States just died 
because of TV coverage. That's the military. I

18:39.452 --> 18:40.153
blame them. I hope they never do that again. They 
just say, CBS, here are the pictures. This is what

18:44.821 --> 18:45.522
you use. If you don't like it, tough luck. You 
mentioned earlier that the war turned bad in the

18:48.648 --> 18:51.915
70s. Right. Because of the influx of personnel 
or... CBS. I blame it. Again, I fall back. I am a

18:59.232 --> 19:03.602
total dislike for... Major news. Major news did 
not care about showing both sides. Major news, all

19:09.082 --> 19:16.429
they wanted to do was either sell newspapers or 
sell primetime television to make commercials.

19:17.110 --> 19:28.442
The more blood, the more guts, the more... And then 
when a person in high school or college sees this,

19:17.110 --> 19:28.442
and they see only CBS's liberal point of view, you 
are... You're not brainwashing, but you're only

19:29.502 --> 19:32.065
showing one side. And they're not showing, 
saying, hey, you know, there might be another

19:32.365 --> 19:35.048
side. There might not have been at that time. But 
they're frightening people. And I think if I was in

19:39.833 --> 19:53.927
college at that time watching Dan Rather or 
whoever was on the CBS News at that time, later on

19:39.833 --> 19:53.927
the ABC started doing the same thing because 
everybody turned to CBS to watch the news. They

19:54.588 --> 19:59.273
started doing the same thing, and they noticed 
their ratings went back up again.

20:01.075 --> 20:04.700
I think that was unfair, very unfair, and I think 
that is one of the major causes. I would have been

20:04.800 --> 20:07.583
totally afraid to go to Vietnam. I would have ran to 
Canada because I know that, in my mind, that I had a

20:07.603 --> 20:17.936
feeling I am going to die, you know, and not 
everybody did die in Vietnam. A lot of percentage

20:17.956 --> 20:21.501
did, but it frightened too many people. I blame 
CBS.
