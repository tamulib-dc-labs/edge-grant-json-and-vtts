WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:07.264
And I also said that I don't know what happened. I 
heard later that they got 10 or 15 years and the guy

00:08.125 --> 00:17.014
that used the machine gun

00:08.125 --> 00:17.014
once again didn't know what he was doing. He was 
high on drugs so he wasn't responsible for his

00:18.155 --> 00:20.938
actions. They had some good civil liberties union 
people in Bung Tao as GI lawyers. I know every one of

00:27.705 --> 00:29.987
them must have been a card-carrying member.

00:32.920 --> 00:35.764
What they should have done is thrown him out of the 
helicopter when they took him down. Did that go on?

00:41.711 --> 00:45.636
You know, I never did see anything like that. Did 
you ever hear anything like that? When I went to

00:48.940 --> 01:00.835
Pleiku in 1970,

00:48.940 --> 01:00.835
there was a big operation going on close to the 
Cambodian border. And this was down close to a

01:02.671 --> 01:06.274
place called the Oasis. There was a tank battalion 
there. An NVA regiment had assaulted this tank

01:10.818 --> 01:11.819
battalion. It was a tank company that was in 
defensive positions at the Oasis, which was an

01:11.839 --> 01:20.307
engineer base

01:11.839 --> 01:20.307
over on Highway 19. And you can see the Chinooks. 
It's a big helicopter. It looks like a banana.

01:26.532 --> 01:32.037
Coming back, and they had cargo nets slung on the 
bottom part of them. And you just looked like they

01:32.962 --> 01:41.153
were carrying regular cargo until they got real 
close to you. And then you could see the arms and

01:41.173 --> 01:48.543
legs sticking out of the cargo. But they were 
bringing about bodies. And then they'd put them in

01:49.464 --> 01:50.606
body bags and ship them home. They had a major 
battle someplace. But that's the only time that

01:51.327 --> 01:55.913
I'd seen anything like that. I had heard that...

02:00.468 --> 02:12.579
You know, sometimes when they were doing some 
interrogation work, that they'd carry a guy up in

02:00.468 --> 02:12.579
the helicopter, two guys up in the helicopter, 
throw one out and get the other to talk. I never saw

02:12.599 --> 02:15.282
anything like that. It's hard for me to comprehend 
that American soldiers would do something like

02:15.302 --> 02:26.132
that. I guess it would be a good way to get a guy to 
talk to them.

02:30.438 --> 02:39.186
But there were a lot of things that went on at the 
South Vietnamese

02:30.438 --> 02:39.186
to get people to talk. I can tell you that if you take 
a silk scarf and you tie the guy down and you put the

02:39.206 --> 02:59.685
silk scarf over his face just to where it comes down 
and touches his nose and his mouth, if you pour

02:39.206 --> 02:59.685
water all over that silk scarf on the top of it to 
where it comes down and lays across the guy's face,

02:39.206 --> 02:59.685
it makes him think that he's suffocating and he 
can't breathe.

03:02.703 --> 03:11.514
Captured

03:02.703 --> 03:11.514
a guy one time that was a tax collector. And since 
I'd already been in Vietnam a year and a half, I knew

03:13.156 --> 03:27.575
that if I turned him over to the Army or the American 
forces, that the guy would be back out there in the

03:13.156 --> 03:27.575
next three or four weeks collecting his taxes 
again. So I took him to a unit called the Mike Force.

03:30.258 --> 03:31.900
Now, this Mike Force had... little bit of Chinese. 
Well, to give you an idea of their company

03:36.729 --> 03:39.633
commander was an Australian. They had three or 
four Special Forces guys with them. They had some

03:44.039 --> 03:46.663
Australian Special Forces people. And then all 
their basic soldiers were Chinese privates. Now

03:51.129 --> 03:58.620
these guys could take a magazine with 20 rounds in 
it and 16 and go anywhere in South Vietnam and

03:51.129 --> 03:58.620
nobody messed with them. They were that bad. And I 
took this guy down there. And I gave him about

04:01.242 --> 04:03.906
40,000 answers. And I said, this man must be a tax 
collector. I caught him on the road this morning

04:06.409 --> 04:10.235
trying to get into the village. And I said, if I take 
him down here and I give him to anybody else, he'll

04:10.255 --> 04:16.504
just be back down here. They said, well, we're 
going to be in the sheriff for a couple of weeks, so

04:16.524 --> 04:19.688
we'll talk to him. Well, they talked to him. They 
hooked him up

04:20.349 --> 04:25.777
to a telephone. And the guy sang like a canary. Got 
all the information they wanted to out of him.

04:30.841 --> 04:39.675
cleaned that guy up, they put him in a suit, and took 
him into town and turned him over to the district

04:30.841 --> 04:39.675
check. Then they went out and got everybody that he 
had put on their list and got everyone. And I never

04:46.605 --> 04:49.330
saw that tax collector again. And I felt good about 
doing that because

04:49.390 --> 04:56.781
he wasn't out there taking the people's money from 
him. wasn't threatening him about to be seen. Now,

04:58.843 --> 05:03.590
I know somebody else took his place, but he wasn't 
there. And I thanked him for it. I thought

05:07.015 --> 05:11.061
it was a good unit. Well, what did you think of the 
Korean forces and the Australian and the, quote,

05:11.101 --> 05:17.530
allies, unquote? Well, the Koreans,

05:17.550 --> 05:26.042
as far as fighting them, now let me just tell you, 
The Koreans did everything in South Vietnam that

05:26.782 --> 05:41.602
we taught them how to do in Korea as far as building 
fire bases, how high the berm had to be, what type of

05:26.782 --> 05:41.602
Constantino wire you had to put out, what your 
firing positions were. And you go over there, and

05:42.643 --> 05:45.967
they had two divisions there that I remember. And 
to go up to An Cay from Quy Nhon, you had to go right

05:46.088 --> 05:52.356
past a rock division fire base. They had one strand 
of bob wire. around their outer berm. One strand of

05:59.626 --> 06:02.529
bottom wire. And they had little signs out there 
saying, please attack us. And you know what? They

06:08.215 --> 06:09.316
never got mortared. They never got sniped at or 
nothing. You go to the next fire base down the road,

06:13.420 --> 06:25.172
which is an American fire base, there must have 
been thousands of yards of concertina wire,

06:13.420 --> 06:25.172
claymore mines, and just everything in the world, 
and they get picked on all day long. So it didn't

06:26.620 --> 06:31.967
matter what the American forces thought about the 
Koreans in South Vietnam. What mattered was how

06:31.987 --> 06:35.872
the North Vietnamese and the B.C. thought about 
the Koreans. And they didn't fool with them. The

06:39.878 --> 06:42.121
Koreans had to go out and beg the B.C. to fight. They 
were good soldiers. They were good soldiers.

06:49.130 --> 06:55.058
Probably the only mistake that we made is 
Lieutenant Calley and some of our lieutenants

06:49.130 --> 06:55.058
went to Vietnam a couple of weeks earlier. And they 
worked with the Korean division. And so when the

06:59.332 --> 07:08.205
American troops got there and Cali took over his 
platoon again and Captain Medina's coming, he

06:59.332 --> 07:08.205
wanted them all to be like the rocks. You have to 
understand the Oriental mind. And I don't think

07:11.830 --> 07:18.721
any white man will ever understand the Oriental 
mind. It's a different concept of operation

07:18.841 --> 07:22.446
completely.

07:23.962 --> 07:29.188
You know, MacArthur was one of the first guys that 
said, don't get involved in a war on the Asian

07:23.962 --> 07:29.188
landmass. And why we continue to do that after we 
saw the French and the Chinese and everybody else

07:29.208 --> 07:36.456
there, you know, is beyond me.

07:39.780 --> 07:49.311
Let me put in here at this time, in case we run out of 
film, that the American soldier on the average in

07:39.780 --> 07:49.311
South Vietnam was a dedicated soldier. I feel 
that, and I guess it's because I had to feel that way

07:50.253 --> 07:54.940
about it. Otherwise, the two years and the 20 years 
that I spent in the military would be wasted

07:54.960 --> 08:03.151
psychologically. It would probably screw my 
brain up pretty bad. I don't have any... negative

08:11.465 --> 08:17.654
things about Vietnam, like Agent Orange or all 
this other crap that some of these people cop out

08:11.465 --> 08:17.654
with. And I think that's what it is, is a cop out. The 
second time I went to South Vietnam, it was evident

08:22.040 --> 08:32.335
to me that the American leaders and the American 
people were not going to let us win the war. We were

08:33.015 --> 08:36.240
not going to be allowed to fight to win. That's the 
reason they pulled us back to the fire bases and the

08:37.469 --> 08:48.584
bridges and say, you can operate within 1,500 
meters of this road, but don't get 1,600 meters

08:37.469 --> 08:48.584
away from the road. Those were the kind of units 
that you had in South Vietnam. And this is getting

08:54.312 --> 08:56.995
back to the question that you asked me about drugs. 
You take all these soldiers and you put them in one

08:58.137 --> 09:03.164
spot for a year and say, you can't move. And the only 
time you're going to move off this bridge is when

09:03.264 --> 09:06.328
you go on R&R. for seven days somewhere out of 
country. Now you take a highly trained fighting

09:10.912 --> 09:22.926
guy that has gone through booby trap warfare and 
all this other crap back here in the States so he can

09:10.912 --> 09:22.926
stay alive when he gets to South Vietnam, and he 
never gets to utilize any of that training. The

09:23.987 --> 09:25.609
guy's bored to death. He sits there, and you can 
only shoot so many rounds at tin cans and stuff like

09:25.629 --> 09:34.860
that, you know, around your perimeter, around 
your bunker, and stuff like that. And you get bored

09:34.880 --> 09:35.961
to death. All these guys, a lot of them, would 
either start drinking liquor or they'd start

09:36.548 --> 09:48.001
smoking pot or they'd mainline heroin. And that's 
when the drug scene really got bad in Vietnam. You

09:54.388 --> 10:02.817
just didn't take guys out into the bush and fight 
the VC at their own game while they're high on

09:54.388 --> 10:02.817
drugs. And the guys knew that. So if they smoked pot 
at all, It was back at the fire base. You didn't do it

10:08.887 --> 10:13.572
out there where you were going to run into somebody 
who was going to try to kill you. So the drug scene

10:13.592 --> 10:21.099
would be bad from 70 on until we got completely out 
of South Vietnam. I left South Vietnam in

10:21.119 --> 10:23.882
September of 1971. Never went back. And I was 
teaching Russian doctrine at West Point in 1975.

10:34.615 --> 10:36.838
in the fall of Saigon. And there were a lot of guys in 
that department that just sat there and cried

10:38.460 --> 10:44.987
because of all the waste. Fifty-four, fifty-five 
thousand guys. A lot of them were friends. Not to

10:51.735 --> 10:58.123
mention all the money and weapons and stuff that we 
left there for these little idiots to run around

10:51.735 --> 10:58.123
Southeast Asia with. You know, we didn't blow 
everything up when we come out of there. So I guess

11:04.282 --> 11:08.887
we all determined that while we were there, we did 
the best that we could.

11:11.951 --> 11:23.804
And then after it was all over with, it was just part 
of your past and you put it behind you and you go

11:11.951 --> 11:23.804
ahead and drive on and get ready for the next one. Do 
you think we could have won the war? We could have

11:26.367 --> 11:29.590
kicked ass and took names over there so easy. We 
could have put the 2nd Armored Division on Highway

11:30.251 --> 11:33.715
1 We could have put the 1st Armored Division on 
Highway 19 and we could have told them to meet us in

11:34.066 --> 11:44.719
Hanoi in two weeks and we'd have won the war. We 
weren't supposed to win the war.

11:49.244 --> 11:52.388
The way I look at it now. Why? I don't know why. I wish 
I did and I wish I could really get all the people

11:54.570 --> 12:02.740
that were responsible for it in the same room and so 
I could nuke them. And he thinks responsible for

12:05.318 --> 12:06.900
it. Well, the American leadership, for one thing, 
was responsible for it. Kennedy, basically, I

12:10.185 --> 12:14.351
think, had the right idea by putting it back. 
Trying to help the people win their own war. Then it

12:17.736 --> 12:19.959
would have meant something. When they started 
escalating and putting American GIs in there, and

12:19.979 --> 12:30.213
we took over the role of the South Vietnamese Army, 
that's when we made our mistake. We could have went

12:31.756 --> 12:32.777
in there and defended the airfields and stuff like 
that, and let the South Vietnam's Army be trained

12:33.365 --> 12:46.597
and be equipped by us and fight their war, then it 
would have been a civil war, okay? We went in there

12:47.378 --> 12:55.085
and tried to intervene, and it was no longer just a 
North Vietnamese, South Vietnamese civil war. It

12:55.105 --> 12:57.167
became a world situation. The Russians were 
supplying the North Vietnamese. We were

12:59.369 --> 13:01.151
supplying the South Vietnamese. They had Russian 
advisors. They had American advisors in

13:03.571 --> 13:08.498
Australia and anybody else that was supposed to be 
in the CTO to help us. And we got overcommitted in

13:09.599 --> 13:22.096
something that

13:09.599 --> 13:22.096
we probably just shouldn't have

13:09.599 --> 13:22.096
even been there. Why do you think we got involved in 
the first place? To stop communism. So do you

13:26.582 --> 13:28.144
believe Truman's theory? Which is? The domino 
theory, if one... Yeah, I think one of these days

13:33.018 --> 13:55.762
that if we don't do something about South America, 
Nicaragua and down in that part of the country,

13:33.018 --> 13:55.762
that something will likely happen like this movie 
that came out several years ago called The Red

13:33.018 --> 13:55.762
Dawn, where they invaded through the Mexican area 
and through Washington State. And then you end up

13:57.264 --> 14:01.388
fighting on your own country, in your own country, 
and you fight a guerrilla war. Because everybody

14:01.823 --> 14:04.747
else around you has finally been cut off. And all 
the fingers are cut off, and now the hand doesn't

14:06.109 --> 14:09.914
operate. And I agree with that theory. And there's 
a solution to it. Okay? We could have stopped

14:16.083 --> 14:21.571
communism in South Vietnam. We could have won the 
war. We won a lot of the fights. You know, a lot of the

14:24.795 --> 14:26.798
battles. The press were the ones that made the Tet 
Offensive a big defeat for American

14:32.097 --> 14:38.122
soldiers. For two weeks, they escalated the war. 
And in two weeks, we had drove them all back. We had

14:44.468 --> 14:54.617
killed maybe 50,000-something Little BC in NVA 
and regained all the territory that we had lost, if

14:44.468 --> 14:54.617
we lost any at all. But the press made it a big defeat 
and a big psychological victory for the BC. Why do

15:03.670 --> 15:06.093
you think the press is allowed such a free hand? I 
don't know. But... And you don't want to get me

15:08.375 --> 15:14.182
started talking about the press because I think 
they're all a bunch of communist pinko pigs. Okay.

15:26.776 --> 15:29.719
That's not a press question. All right, you had 
said... made some comments about the National

15:32.071 --> 15:35.856
Guard. Do you think they should have been brought 
over to fight? I don't see why. I don't see any need

15:45.147 --> 15:48.832
for the National Guard to be called up unless it's 
the last. You know, to me, the National Guard is

15:51.135 --> 15:55.480
going to be here to defend the homeland. If the 
regular army can't take care of something

15:55.662 --> 16:03.329
someplace else, then you call up the National 
Guard and the Army Reserve, and then you get them

15:55.662 --> 16:03.329
involved in it. I realize that there are 
specialized units, like special forces, some Air

16:03.349 --> 16:15.100
Force units, fighter jobs, and stuff like that, 
that you may need to infuse into the total program.

16:15.841 --> 16:22.547
But to nationalize the National Guard, to go 
overseas to fight in South Vietnam, to me, was

16:15.841 --> 16:22.547
stupid. I don't think they were needed. I really 
don't. There were enough original army units

16:29.014 --> 16:40.790
around that could have taken care of the situation 
if they would have been allowed to fight the way

16:29.014 --> 16:40.790
that we were trained and not to do this and don't do 
that and oh, you can't do this. If we would have

16:42.292 --> 16:51.625
fought in South Vietnam like they fought World War 
II and World War I, we wouldn't. How long do you

16:51.645 --> 16:52.787
think it would have taken them? I don't know. I 
don't think it would have took very long. You would

16:57.797 --> 17:01.802
have had a lot of holdouts that would have been in 
the mountains and had guerrilla warfare. But you

17:01.822 --> 17:06.208
can fight guerrilla warfare with 
counterinsurgency. You go in and you take care of

17:06.509 --> 17:08.331
the guerrillas. You don't go in and settle down in a 
village and wait for them. You move into their area

17:14.879 --> 17:21.268
and you snipe at them and you ambush them and you 
take care of them and you fight the way they fight.

17:21.288 --> 17:23.230
And eventually, you kill them all. You don't get 
rid of the guerrilla fighter by going in and

17:24.931 --> 17:47.137
assaulting his women or burning down his village 
or things like that because every time you do

17:24.931 --> 17:47.137
something like that, for every one guerrilla that 
you kill, you've got ten more that's willing to

17:24.931 --> 17:47.137
join their army because you've hurt their family, 
you've burned up their hooch, you've destroyed

17:24.931 --> 17:47.137
their food and things like that. But you can kill 
off the guerrillas. Why do you think, or do you

17:50.301 --> 17:53.284
think we use conventional warfare tactics 
against an army or the B.C. that was so much

17:58.576 --> 18:02.680
guerrilla warfare? I think basically your North 
Vietnamese army was conventional, and I think

18:02.700 --> 18:07.264
your B.C. were the guerrillas. And I think if we 
would have operated the same way, when we first got

18:08.145 --> 18:16.113
into South Vietnam, they said, oh, well, the 
knight belongs to Charlie. Well, hell, the knight

18:16.233 --> 18:18.035
didn't belong to Charlie. The knight belonged to 
whoever went out there and took it. When we started

18:20.753 --> 18:28.744
our night ambushes and we started moving at night 
and engaging the VC at night, they quit moving

18:20.753 --> 18:28.744
around. You know, you isolate them into certain 
areas. And if you don't interdict trails 24 hours a

18:33.171 --> 18:42.184
day, and sometime during that day, Charlie's 
going to figure out what your sequence is and he's

18:33.171 --> 18:42.184
going to move. But if you keep interdicting 
everything and you fight them when they fight,

18:43.185 --> 18:47.892
you're killing them.

18:51.128 --> 18:57.495
What did y'all do when the VC didn't want to fight or 
the NBA didn't want to fight, just didn't? We'd go

18:57.515 --> 19:01.439
look

18:57.515 --> 19:01.439
for them. We'd pick out areas that had a lot of, we'd 
get a lot of intel out of it. You know, you had five

19:08.947 --> 19:13.652
categories of intelligence. The number one 
source was American ice, salt. The number five

19:18.537 --> 19:19.718
was... Some rice farmers we heard about said he saw 
so-and-so over here. You know, that was the

19:24.836 --> 19:26.818
difference between the two. So that's when they 
started sending out a lot of long-range patrols.

19:32.226 --> 19:40.417
And that's when guys started going into the jungle 
and getting back in there and sneaking people and

19:32.226 --> 19:40.417
finding them, you know, where they were. That's 
when you got your tunnel rats that started going

19:41.078 --> 19:47.747
into your tunnels and everything and going down 
and blowing up their holes and stuff. somewhere

19:48.487 --> 19:54.136
they couldn't use them, and then they had to come 
out and build. The defoliation program with Agent

19:54.156 --> 19:57.141
Orange. You know, for what it was supposed to do, 
you know, kill all the trees and everything so you

19:58.964 --> 20:07.317
could see stuff walking around, it was great, but 
it was killing everybody else it touched, too. You

20:07.337 --> 20:13.808
know, you've got a lot of guys out here that say that 
they breathed it or whatever it is, and now their

20:07.337 --> 20:13.808
kids have got cancer. I don't know if any of that 
stuff is true or not. I don't know if it's a bunch of

20:15.773 --> 20:20.120
guys just trying to get some more insurance or 
anything. Frankly, if they get it, I think they got

20:20.881 --> 20:25.388
it coming to them because they were there. But I 
don't think that was the way to fight the war. We had

20:29.796 --> 20:34.683
enough guys that were trained to fight as 
guerrilla warfare people. We could have, if

20:34.703 --> 20:40.633
nothing else, just flooded special forces people 
all over the country and trained the mountain

20:34.703 --> 20:40.633
yards. The mountain yards hated the Vietnamese. 
They didn't care if it was north or south. If they

20:44.694 --> 20:47.318
were Vietnamese, they'd like to kill them. You 
know, we could have trained all the mountain yards

20:47.338 --> 20:54.148
in South Vietnam, and they could have took over the 
country. What is it?

20:57.954 --> 20:58.615
Politics. And I don't know enough about politics 
to talk about them, but I can tell you, somebody

21:00.918 --> 21:08.730
made wrong decisions to back their own people. How 
about General Key? Where's he at right now? New

21:14.325 --> 21:15.065
Mexico? Living high off the hog? I know he's in the 
United States someplace. He was the prime

21:19.591 --> 21:24.596
minister of South Vietnam. Where does he get all 
this money? What other credibility did the guy

21:28.000 --> 21:39.173
have except he was an Air Force general that we had 
trained, and he ran their Air Force for them, and

21:28.000 --> 21:39.173
then when we threw out them and his brother... He 
took over the government. Where'd he get all his

21:42.538 --> 21:46.242
money to live high on the hog out here in New Mexico 
or California? You think some of it came from all

21:46.262 --> 21:54.750
that stuff that was supposed to go to the buildings 
for the classification that didn't make it? I'd

21:55.691 --> 21:56.892
say so. I'd say so.

22:00.756 --> 22:06.342
Matter of fact, if it wouldn't be so bold, I'd say 
I'd stake my life

22:00.756 --> 22:06.342
on it.

22:09.376 --> 22:19.510
About

22:09.376 --> 22:19.510
Jim and his brother, do you think we assassinated 
him? We did? No, we didn't. The South Vietnamese

22:21.953 --> 22:23.596
Army did. You think we helped set it up?

22:28.723 --> 22:29.123
I don't know. I would say so. Why? Just by the way 
that things ran in South Vietnam. I think the CIA

22:35.192 --> 22:38.877
had their fingers in every little dirty thing over 
there. And if they didn't, then Navy intelligence

22:39.464 --> 22:44.913
or Army intelligence or somebody knew what 
happened. And they either knew it was going to

22:45.874 --> 22:54.167
happen and could have prevented it, or they 
participated in it. You think this is the only

22:54.187 --> 22:55.429
case? No, no. I'm sure there was a lot of

22:58.314 --> 23:03.883
that. You've got to understand now that I was just 
Staff Sergeant E6, And I spent 11 months and 16 days

23:07.814 --> 23:15.149
in the bush until I hit the second evac hospital and 
got med evac'd. Okay? I stayed out in the field. My

23:18.035 --> 23:19.237
bag wasn't politics. It was staying alive and 
doing my job. And I didn't get into the pot smoking

23:23.205 --> 23:26.271
or the beer drinking or anything else. The only 
time I drank beer is when I went back to Hawaii on my

23:26.291 --> 23:29.738
own.

23:36.282 --> 23:41.629
When did you get involved

23:36.282 --> 23:41.629
with the Special Forces? Well, I got a little tied 
up with a guy named Major Hudson that I mentioned

23:41.649 --> 23:52.363
before. He was with Charlie 75th Range. And did 
some insurgent work with him because I was the

23:53.024 --> 24:04.078
operation sergeant for the camp, or the camp 
squadron that I was in. helicopter resources that

24:04.936 --> 24:10.083
were available was through our cabinets. Well 
after being there for about six months I was

24:10.103 --> 24:33.795
getting bored sitting around answering radios 
and stuff like that so I started flying and doing

24:10.103 --> 24:33.795
some insurgents and stuff with the retrieve 
commander of the helicopter unit and got to know

24:10.103 --> 24:33.795
Major Hudson pretty good and then started doing 
some penetration work with him as a team leader and

24:10.103 --> 24:33.795
operation sergeant for him. you know, just sort of 
eased into it. It wasn't hard. All you had to do was

24:39.613 --> 24:46.463
be dumb enough to volunteer for different things, 
and people always accept you, you know. I did that

24:46.924 --> 24:53.334
kind of work for about six months, and then the 
squadron commander called me into his office. I

24:53.354 --> 25:02.888
was getting ready to rotate back, and I had an 
assignment at Fort Hood, Texas, Lord have mercy.

25:04.798 --> 25:08.565
And I would have extended another year in Vietnam 
to stay out in Texas. And he said, how would you like

25:10.108 --> 25:12.392
to go to West Point? And I said, don't you think I'm a 
little old to go to West Point? And he says, no, you

25:15.818 --> 25:19.505
idiot, as an instructor, not a cadet. Because I was 
already an E-7 and was on the E-8 list.

25:27.657 --> 25:29.459
I said, well, I said, where's it at? And I didn't 
know anything about West Point. I knew that's

25:30.940 --> 25:39.089
where they had lieutenants come out of West Point, 
someplace in New York, and it's on the Hudson River

25:30.940 --> 25:39.089
and everything. And he talked to me about it, and he 
said, well, the armored branch at West Point is

25:39.109 --> 25:50.601
looking for a noncommissioned officer to come up 
there and be an instructor. And I said, I'd like to

25:50.621 --> 25:52.984
hear what he does. And I said, hell, I'll do it. So I 
got out of country two days early because they

25:56.311 --> 26:02.156
wanted me to spend a couple of weeks with the 
armored sergeant that was already at West Point. I

26:02.977 --> 26:09.023
had a little overlap there between us so I could 
learn the job real good from him before he DD'd out

26:02.977 --> 26:09.023
of the area. And I left Vietnam in September of 71 
and went to West Point and I stayed there for five

26:09.043 --> 26:17.270
years. I took the cadets down to Fort Knox every 
summer. I taught your basic military science

26:21.394 --> 26:26.098
classes small unit tactics, terrain 
interpretation, main navigation. The last two

26:32.770 --> 26:41.038
years I was there, I got into Russian doctrine and 
started teaching some junior and senior classes

26:32.770 --> 26:41.038
in Russian. I knew a lot about the Russian tactics. 
And then from there, I went to 3rd Squadron, 2nd

26:43.800 --> 26:49.926
Camp in Germany, in a little town called Amberg. I 
was 1st Sergeant for K Troop. And I ran the border

26:53.490 --> 26:55.832
for three years. and really enjoy it. The same 
colonel came through on an IG inspection tour

26:59.999 --> 27:09.130
right before I got ready to be released out of 
Germany and said, how'd you like to go back to West

26:59.999 --> 27:09.130
Point? And I said, well, you know, that's probably 
one of the best tours I've ever had. I said, I'd like

27:12.374 --> 27:15.137
to go back there. So in 78, October 78, my family and 
I went back to West Point. Except this time we were

27:23.527 --> 27:25.870
living on Sergeant Major's Road. And these were 
homes that were built in the late 1800s, and they

27:26.592 --> 27:35.301
were beautiful, and they had big fireplaces, and 
the ceilings were 11 foot high. And I said, finally

27:35.321 --> 27:37.123
it arrived. You know, I finally made it. And I came 
out on the sergeant major's list. I was supposed to

27:45.311 --> 27:48.054
go to Bliss, the sergeant major's academy. And I 
said, whoa, I better call and find out where I'm

27:48.975 --> 27:54.220
going to go when I get out of the sergeant major's 
academy. because I was due to be in there in

27:55.280 --> 27:59.365
January, and this is October. So I called DA and I 
said, hey, Phil, I said, where am I supposed to go

28:01.067 --> 28:08.137
when I graduate from Sergeant Major's Academy? He 
said, well, you're supposed to go to Germany. I

28:11.441 --> 28:14.325
said, I just came back from Germany. He says, I 
know, but he says, well, you'll do six months at the

28:14.345 --> 28:18.129
Sergeant Major's Academy. We'll leave you there 
six months as an instructor, and then you can go

28:18.690 --> 28:22.435
back to... You know, you'll have about another six 
months to wait before you get your sergeant major

28:22.988 --> 28:26.936
strike. So we'll put you in a unit where we've got a 
sergeant major that's getting ready to rotate in

28:27.698 --> 28:34.011
six months, and then you just step right into his 
position. I was tickled to death. I loved Europe.

28:38.300 --> 28:43.832
Because every year we'd take 20 days, and we'd just 
travel all over Europe and camp out and just do what

28:38.300 --> 28:43.832
we wanted to do. I went home that evening and I said, 
guess what? I'm on the sergeant major's list and

28:48.385 --> 28:56.958
we're going to do six months at Fort Bliss and then 
six months there as an instructor. And then we're

28:56.978 --> 29:01.285
going back to Germany.

29:01.305 --> 29:01.926
I ain't going back to Germany. And I said, well, I'm 
not going back to Germany myself because if I go by

29:01.946 --> 29:12.402
myself, then that's two years that I have to do by 
myself and my family from the States. So I called DA

29:13.360 --> 29:16.745
the next day and I said, hey, what are my options? 
And he said, you've got two choices. He says, you

29:20.069 --> 29:24.895
can go back to Germany when you get out and start a 
major academy, or you can retire. Well, he upset

29:26.478 --> 29:28.620
me. And I said, well, I'm going to take my models and 
I'm going home. And I retired.

29:37.713 --> 29:38.474
I've regretted it ever since. I should have stayed 
in. I have 28 years in now. I'd be some fat old sard

29:43.735 --> 29:50.364
maker someplace in Europe in a guest house 
drinking cold beer and smoking a cigar.

29:54.690 --> 29:58.054
What did you see happening in Vietnam while you 
were stateside between your tours? Hmm. Didn't

30:03.281 --> 30:04.943
really pay that much attention to it. I just 
watched the news every day and tried to keep up with

30:05.083 --> 30:11.532
some of the old units that I was in. I think it 
became... I think after the initial Tet Offensive

30:14.643 --> 30:30.208
and it started settling down that things in 
Vietnam started changing from what a military man

30:14.643 --> 30:30.208
would consider okay to bad because you had to start 
asking for permissions to fire. I think the

30:30.348 --> 30:39.763
involvement in South Vietnam changed after the 
Tet Offensive because they thought that... You

30:40.553 --> 30:48.143
know, that American soldier got beaten bad during 
the Tet Offensive, and that wasn't the case at all.

30:49.164 --> 30:54.051
I think it was just a matter of bad publicity as far 
as the military was concerned. And I think people

30:56.094 --> 31:03.744
were just tired of it, didn't want us there, and it 
was time to either finish it up or get out. What did

31:05.346 --> 31:08.350
you see happen with the United States government 
while you were stateside?

31:11.401 --> 31:27.103
Well, I think more and more politicians were 
listening to their constituents and they were

31:11.401 --> 31:27.103
starting to turn the screws in different ways 
politically to get the troops out of South

31:11.401 --> 31:27.103
Vietnam. I don't know. It was just, uh, Everybody 
at first was on the bandwagon and then rapidly

31:33.440 --> 31:43.792
started jumping off of it because they could see 
that it really wasn't what the public wanted. I

31:43.812 --> 31:48.177
think it was just a difficult situation for 
political figures. They didn't know which way to

31:48.857 --> 31:50.099
jump. They couldn't make a decision. And that was 
one of the reasons why the military figures in

31:52.782 --> 32:00.430
South Vietnam were not allowed to win the war. Win 
the battles, but don't win the war. And there was a

32:04.523 --> 32:08.407
lot of pressure on people to turn everything back 
over to the South Vietnamese.

32:11.010 --> 32:18.617
Why do you think the government had this attitude 
of, okay, we'll let you in the bowels, but we won't

32:11.010 --> 32:18.617
let you in the war? Why do you think they didn't want 
to go in and win? Well, you know, it started out at

32:23.422 --> 32:34.193
first with just advisors, and then we built up a 
little bit because of the Gulf of Tonkin incident,

32:23.422 --> 32:34.193
and U.S. ships were fired on. and we'll send the 
Marines in and protect the air bases. And then it

32:38.997 --> 32:43.401
just sort of got escalated, and it got away from 
them. And I don't know if it was because there were

32:45.243 --> 32:51.308
general officers in South Vietnam saying, hey, 
we've got to have this, we've got to have this,

32:45.243 --> 32:51.308
we've got to have this. And they just kept trying to 
build it up because, hey, you know, it's great.

32:54.692 --> 32:55.712
It's the only war we've got. We might as well make 
the most of it. Thank God most military men don't

32:58.715 --> 33:01.818
think that way. There are some that do. But I would 
hopefully think that most of them don't. I think if

33:09.302 --> 33:13.547
you talk to most military men, they'll tell you 
that they're the first ones that really don't want

33:09.302 --> 33:13.547
to fight. And that is if they've seen any fighting 
at all. And I think over the, as it continued, they

33:18.492 --> 33:29.824
realized that it had gotten out of hand, and they 
were trying to do something about it, and they

33:18.492 --> 33:29.824
didn't know how to do it. It was like they'd got it 
all started, Now where are we going with it and how

33:33.657 --> 33:43.116
are we going to get out of it and still save face and 
still try to accomplish the things that we set out

33:33.657 --> 33:43.116
to do? The first thing was to prevent the takeover 
of South Vietnam from the communists. Was it

33:48.626 --> 33:54.518
really communists or was it just a revolution 
between North Vietnam and South Vietnam? I guess

33:55.325 --> 34:05.300
it would have been okay if Chinese weapons and 
Russian weapons and stuff like that hadn't got

33:55.325 --> 34:05.300
involved, and then we hadn't got involved, and we 
just let them fight on our own. But other people got

34:05.961 --> 34:08.325
involved, so we got involved too. It's always a lot 
better to fight a war on somebody else's ground

34:11.069 --> 34:14.654
than fight it on yours. Okay, when you went back for 
your second tour, were you involved in any way with

34:16.877 --> 34:23.307
the Cambodian invasion in 1972? I sat in Saigon for 
31 days while the invasion of Cambodia was going

34:24.552 --> 34:35.048
on. The only indirect way that I got involved with 
the Cambodian invasion was that we had done some

34:35.448 --> 34:48.788
recon in the Parrot Peak area about four months 
before the invasion. And that was the only way. I

34:52.242 --> 34:57.410
didn't get directly involved with the invasion of 
Cambodia other than to do some recon. What do you

34:57.430 --> 34:57.930
think? President Nixon was right in invading 
Cambodia and extending the war beyond Vietnam, or

34:57.970 --> 35:07.044
do you think it was a bad move? I think it was a couple 
years too late. It wasn't only Cambodia that

35:10.929 --> 35:16.918
the North Vietnamese... had supply dumps and 
everything. If we were going to invade Cambodia,

35:19.166 --> 35:25.339
why didn't we do Cambodia, Laos, and why didn't we 
do North Vietnam? Why didn't we do it all?

35:31.411 --> 35:34.097
I think he was talked into doing it high-ranking 
military officers from the South Vietnamese

35:35.883 --> 35:41.993
government, plus us, to push that back. Or maybe 
the South Vietnamese told him that, hey, if you'll

35:42.193 --> 35:51.067
take care of these things, then when you start your 
withdrawal, then we can take care of everything

35:42.193 --> 35:51.067
else on our own. I don't know. I know that Cambodia 
had a lot of storage areas. I think it was a good

36:00.262 --> 36:03.207
move. militarily to go in and knock out supply 
dumps and destroy troops where they no longer had a

36:03.507 --> 36:25.397
sanctuary where they could they could run to and 
then stick their noses and their tongues out at you

36:03.507 --> 36:25.397
you know back across the river and say nanny nanny 
boo boo you can't come and get me you know uh when you

36:03.507 --> 36:25.397
find a situation like this or you you fight these 
kind of battles You know, you're limited in what

36:27.149 --> 36:31.637
you can do if the other guy can just duck back across 
the border. It was the same thing with the 38th

36:31.657 --> 36:37.266
Parallel or whatever it was at the Yalu River in 
Korea. You know, for their MiGs to dash back across

36:37.887 --> 36:45.340
the Yalu River and us not being able to pursue them 
was stupid. You know, they can come down south all

36:47.082 --> 36:53.393
they wanted to and shoot everything up and dash 
back across the river, and we was... either

36:53.744 --> 37:02.414
getting guys busted or slapped the wrist or sent 
them back to Japan just because they couldn't go

36:53.744 --> 37:02.414
back across the river, and they were severely 
punished if they did do that. And for us to make

37:02.994 --> 37:16.449
arbitrary penetrations across into Cambodia or 
Laos to chase some gooks that have been shooting at

37:02.994 --> 37:16.449
us all day long, and now it's nighttime and they 
want to go camp out across the river, you know,

37:02.994 --> 37:16.449
that's stupid. If you're going to fight a war, then 
fight it. And that's one of the reasons why we

37:19.968 --> 37:31.985
couldn't, you know, you can win the battles, but 
you can't win the war because you're so limited

37:19.968 --> 37:31.985
because of political situations that dictate to 
you on how you're going to fight your enemy. All

37:34.489 --> 37:34.709
right. Earlier you said when you were in Tet that in 
the combat zone and in the fire zone you didn't have

37:35.250 --> 37:42.200
to call and ask. You know, you knew you could fight. 
Did this having to call and request to get in the

37:43.381 --> 37:49.350
firefight occurred while you were there or had it 
occurred while you were stateside? No, that

37:55.890 --> 38:13.610
started when I came back in the end of 1968 there was 
a lot of changes that took place over there I guess

37:55.890 --> 38:13.610
because when I got back over in country in 1970 it

37:55.890 --> 38:13.610
was different. A lot of your major units were 
standing down like the 4th Infantry Division was

38:18.001 --> 38:22.587
getting ready to break up and come back home. And 
they were infusing a lot of their troops into units

38:23.048 --> 38:26.753
that were going to stay. So they were already 
starting their withdrawal.

38:33.182 --> 38:37.548
They didn't go out and really do search and destroy 
missions anymore.

38:41.433 --> 38:45.038
They stayed pretty close to the highways and just 
seemed like they didn't want to fight. And the

38:45.710 --> 38:47.833
American soldiers didn't want to fight. And one of 
the things that we had to do in the Anke area there

38:47.973 --> 38:58.389
for quite a while is we had to call up the district 
advisor and say, hey, we're in this area. We see

38:58.850 --> 39:03.677
people carrying weapons, and they're going this 
way. Can we engage them? We had it before in 68. If

39:06.902 --> 39:11.329
you saw people wearing black pajamas carrying 
weapons... then they were the enemy. Now, in 1970,

39:14.683 --> 39:18.027
we don't know who they are. We got to call and get 
permission to engage them. Now, if they turned

39:22.212 --> 39:26.518
around and engaged us, then we could engage them. 
So I guess there were a lot of American units that

39:27.920 --> 39:32.726
got engaged first, and then they engaged the 
enemy. It was, you know, question this, question

39:34.067 --> 39:37.772
that.

39:42.376 --> 39:43.318
It was a different thing. The two years changed the 
thing in South Vietnam. What happened there while

39:47.244 --> 39:49.949
I was gone, I don't know. I was comfortable being a 
military man in 1967 and 68 when I was in Vietnam.

39:58.302 --> 40:01.948
And I was a good soldier. And I was a good soldier in 
1970 and 71. And I did basically the same things

40:04.933 --> 40:08.299
once I got back into it again. But the rules of 
engagement had changed, and the feeling of the

40:08.853 --> 40:22.627
military in South Vietnam, U.S. and Arvin, had 
changed. And it was just, you couldn't really put

40:23.368 --> 40:28.053
your finger on it, but you could feel it. It was 
finally like somebody had realized, hey, we got us

40:30.015 --> 40:34.540
a no-win situation here. You know? We're not. 
We're winning the fights, and we're getting our

40:37.896 --> 40:43.843
body count, and we're doing this and we're doing 
that, and we're still losing guys. Where's the

40:44.524 --> 40:46.106
final objective? People were starting to 
realize, what's the final objective? We're not

40:52.675 --> 40:54.297
going to be allowed to win this thing. And I think a 
lot of your senior NCOs and your senior officers

40:55.218 --> 41:00.124
were starting to realize that. So what they were 
trying to do is protect... and really not engage.

41:08.215 --> 41:11.819
Because if you don't engage the enemy, then you 
don't get shot at and you don't get people hurt.

41:16.264 --> 41:19.708
How were you treated, first of all, when you came 
home in 68? Did you come home as a unit, as y'all had

41:20.448 --> 41:26.575
went over there as a unit, or did you come back as an 
individual? I was medevaced, so I came back on a

41:27.296 --> 41:33.282
hospital plane. And of course, when we landed in 
San Francisco, we didn't go through the normal

41:35.320 --> 41:45.595
airport or anything like that. We went into a 
military base there in San Francisco. We stayed on

41:49.341 --> 41:56.231
military aircraft when I got to Martin Army 
Hospital in Fort Hood. So I didn't see a bunch of

41:56.972 --> 41:58.394
civilians. I stayed around. I was hooked up 
completely with the military.

42:05.105 --> 42:09.249
Never had much to do with civilians as far as the 20 
years that I spent in the military.

42:11.872 --> 42:19.700
I heard a lot of guys say that when they come home 
that they got spit on and they had stuff thrown at

42:11.872 --> 42:19.700
them and things like that. I never had anything 
like that happen to me.

42:26.927 --> 42:34.234
I had some in-laws and some cousins and stuff like 
that ask me what I thought about the involvement of

42:26.927 --> 42:34.234
South Vietnam. course being pro-military like I 
was I just told him what I thought used to in the

42:35.699 --> 43:01.200
military you could put your uniform on and go 
downtown and people would slap you on the back and

42:35.699 --> 43:01.200
and the military guy was proud to wear his uniform 
you can get you wearing a uniform walking into a

42:35.699 --> 43:01.200
cafe when I went into the military would get you a 
free cup of coffee because that's what people

43:01.703 --> 43:07.459
thought about veterans and people that served in 
the armed forces. Nowadays, I think it's a very

43:09.124 --> 43:14.920
rare thing, unless you're around a military base, 
that you'll see guys in uniform used to it was a

43:15.659 --> 43:38.173
regulation that when you travel by civilian 
airline you had to travel with your uniform on if

43:15.659 --> 43:38.173
you were military now they don't care they let you 
go anywhere you want to in civilian clothes as long

43:15.659 --> 43:38.173
as you report into duty with your uniform on so to me 
that's wrong i think if you're in the military you

43:15.659 --> 43:38.173
ought to wear your uniform when you travel I don't 
care if the civilian public like it or not. That's

43:41.625 --> 43:48.780
an obligation that you owe yourself and the 
military because you're there with them. I don't

43:48.840 --> 43:49.581
know. I think it's a sad situation because I think 
the civilian people ought to sit back and think all

43:51.986 --> 44:00.583
through history. And I don't care which war 
they're talking about. I don't care if it's Korea.

44:04.566 --> 44:12.513
I don't care if it was Chesty Puller down in Havana, 
Cuba in the early 1900s. Think where the United

44:14.054 --> 44:19.579
States of America would be today if you didn't have 
veterans.

44:23.282 --> 44:28.666
What do you think the civilian population was 
thinking while, especially after Tet, while you

44:23.282 --> 44:28.666
were in Vietnam? What was their attitude? Well, I 
don't know what they were thinking, and quite

44:31.968 --> 44:34.532
frankly, I didn't care. Things were so hot and 
heavy and busy, we really didn't think about what

44:34.572 --> 44:43.886
the civilians were doing. After a while, that was 
about the same time that Jane Fonda started all her

44:44.006 --> 44:53.420
crap, and Joan Baez and some of these other people. 
And the only comments that you'd have are, gee, I'd

44:55.263 --> 45:01.452
like to see her for just a few minutes. or wish she 
was here on receiving into some of this crap.

45:08.632 --> 45:13.365
And I'd like for her to be here so I could explain to 
her why we're in this country. You know, she talks

45:13.683 --> 45:30.745
about the bombing of North Vietnam, but she never 
walked through a village in South Vietnam and saw

45:13.683 --> 45:30.745
little kids with legs missing or arms missing or 
walked into a village right after the VC had been

45:13.683 --> 45:30.745
there and taken care of the village chief and his 
kids and the teachers and stuff like that. She

45:31.546 --> 45:32.387
never done that. She never had the opportunity to 
do that. I just wish that I could have shown all that

45:34.289 --> 45:37.954
to her.

45:43.461 --> 45:43.521
Um, What do you think the military needs to learn 
from Vietnam? One of the first things that we knew

45:48.736 --> 45:55.346
before we even went into South Vietnam, don't get 
involved in a war on an Asian land mass.

45:58.230 --> 45:59.592
I guess three reasons. One is it costs too much 
money. It's not politically sound. And if you

46:06.842 --> 46:12.951
don't have the complete backing of the country, 
you're going to lose men for no reason because

46:06.842 --> 46:12.951
you're not going to win. those three things and 
it's unfortunate because they're

46:15.445 --> 46:44.980
good fighters they've been at it all their lives 
you know but they can be beat if it came to that they

46:15.445 --> 46:44.980
could be beat and it doesn't have to be done with 
nuclear weapons it can be done with conventional

46:15.445 --> 46:44.980
warfare but if the one thing that I would tell the 
government of the United States, that if you're

46:46.023 --> 47:02.950
going to commit American soldiers to do 
something, don't tie their hands behind their

46:46.023 --> 47:02.950
back and tell them that you want them to win and then 
stand back and let them win.

47:08.079 --> 47:08.800
Okay. You talked about the bombing of North 
Vietnam, Bowling Thunder. Do you think it was

47:14.778 --> 47:16.040
effective?

47:22.228 --> 47:24.772
Yeah, I think to an extent a lot of it was effective.

47:27.396 --> 47:29.559
I think there was a lot of misdirected targets. I 
think there was a lot of bombing raids that didn't

47:30.801 --> 47:41.275
hit anything because they were afraid to hit 
civilian areas.

47:44.380 --> 47:44.700
And You know, when you do bombing on that scale, 
then you're gonna have to accept a certain amount

47:45.659 --> 47:56.091
of civilian casualties.
