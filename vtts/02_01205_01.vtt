WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:02.895
Testing 1, 2, 3. Testing 1, 2, 3.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.974
Today is what, April the 8th? April the 8th. 1979, 
and we're here to talk about the Texas A&M

00:15.336 --> 00:19.141
University Press. What I'd like to talk about 
first, though, is John Lindsay, and ask you to tell

00:19.922 --> 00:31.516
me a little bit about your childhood, where you 
were born, how you happened to become an Aggie, and

00:19.922 --> 00:31.516
all that stuff. I mean, incidentally, have you 
been interviewed formally like this for A&M at

00:31.896 --> 00:37.243
all? Yes, I have. Mary Ellen Bowers did. She's got a 
film now on film on some of these things. Anyway,

00:52.529 --> 00:53.811
let's do it again. Tell me a little about your 
childhood. Where were you born? Actually, I was

00:58.919 --> 01:02.163
born in Waxahachie, Texas. My father was born and 
raised in Illinois and came down here during World

01:03.205 --> 01:12.639
War I and met a mother who lived in Waxahachie.

01:13.921 --> 01:21.152
I didn't live there but about one year of my life, 
however, so I don't remember it all.

01:21.993 --> 01:32.446
We moved to Houston when I was about one year old, so 
I've really called myself a native Houstonian.

01:32.486 --> 01:37.031
There you are.

01:37.913 --> 01:41.877
My father graduated from Wesleyan University in 
Middletown, Connecticut. My mother was a music

01:41.897 --> 01:50.548
major at Columbia, so they had no connection with 
any universities in this part of the world. But I

01:53.522 --> 02:06.244
had a lot of friends at high school at Lamar and a lot 
of them went to NM during the reign of John

01:53.522 --> 02:06.244
Kimbrough, the football team. So that really 
swayed me a lot at NM because I had a lot of friends

02:06.264 --> 02:14.638
that went there the year before I did. They came by 
my house and Their parents were friends of my

02:16.415 --> 02:24.767
parents, and so that's how I got to steward the 
Texas A&M. Let's get a little on the hard data. When

02:26.790 --> 02:27.811
were you born? What's your birthday? My birthday 
is July the 28th, 1922. And when did you arrive at

02:30.255 --> 02:38.327
Texas A&M? In 1940, in the fall of 1940.

02:43.938 --> 02:48.426
And what were you planning to do when you got there? 
I had no idea what I was going to do. I'm still trying

02:52.053 --> 02:54.998
to figure out what I'm going to do. No, I started out 
in engineering

02:55.019 --> 03:02.212
because I really didn't know what to do. Excuse me. 
That didn't last very long, and I switched to a

03:05.015 --> 03:20.061
major in economics and a minor in accounting and 
statistics, which is now the business field, I

03:05.015 --> 03:20.061
guess you could say. That was in liberal arts, I 
made it with the family. Good work, liberal arts,

03:23.086 --> 03:26.412
right. That's correct. finished A&M, or did you 
get called into service? Well, I got called into

03:31.571 --> 03:33.394
service, right. We went year-round to school, you 
know, so in the

03:33.694 --> 03:46.252
summer of 43, we got called into Fort Sam Houston. 
They picked up the class of 44 and 45 one night, late

03:46.272 --> 03:51.840
at night. We got on the train and went to San 
Antonio. And from there, we I went to the

03:56.990 --> 04:04.620
various... No, we did not get our degrees. I was 14 
hours short. Some did, a class of 43 did. But 44 and

04:11.829 --> 04:13.831
45 did not. And we went to, all of us went to Fort Sam, 
Houston. And then we sort of spread out from there.

04:24.010 --> 04:35.862
They sent us to, the engineers went to engineering 
school, OCS rather,

04:24.010 --> 04:35.862
and the infantry went to the infantry . And I was in 
the field artillery, so I went to Fort

04:35.882 --> 04:45.372
Sill at the moment. And got a, graduated from OCS, 
second lieutenant, and stayed at Fort Sill. for

04:51.378 --> 04:57.785
about a year and a half and then went overseas to 
Italy. Did you do training? Yes, basic training.

05:04.292 --> 05:07.576
And so then you went overseas in 45? January of 45. 
Europe,

05:09.658 --> 05:13.362
France? Italy. Italy. Yeah. Going to combat? 
Well, no. I was at a replacement. They didn't need

05:22.994 --> 05:24.856
any field artillery officers. I was a field 
artillery officer, and there were several of us,

05:24.916 --> 05:31.686
and they didn't need any field artillery 
officers. And we were in this replacement

05:31.706 --> 05:37.474
training center waiting to be called up by 
somebody. And while I was there, I was just there

05:37.494 --> 05:43.743
for six months, and while I was there, the war was 
over. So we got on the ship at Lake Horn, Italy, and

05:44.504 --> 05:48.790
went... through the Panama Canal to Manila in the 
Philippines. Oh, did you? Oh, they just picked you

05:54.230 --> 05:55.131
up. Yep. We went straight across. Forty-five days 
on the ocean liner. You won't forget that. No, I

06:03.704 --> 06:04.905
won't forget that. I will not forget that. That was 
quite a trip. I'll bet that was. Then in the

06:09.332 --> 06:18.405
Philippines, I was there when the atomic bomb was 
dropped on Japan. We rejoiced, of course, and I

06:18.706 --> 06:23.112
still am rejoicing about that. It saved my life. No 
question about it. And then after that, we left the

06:28.380 --> 06:37.993
Philippines and went to Japan, and I spent a year in 
the Army of Occupation in Japan. In Tokyo? In

06:39.135 --> 06:40.176
Tokyo. By that side of Tokyo. About 20 miles north 
of Tokyo. Yeah, it's a beautiful, beautiful

06:46.145 --> 06:55.095
place. I haven't been back. I know I should. So far 
away. Yeah. We went to talk to some of the rice

07:00.842 --> 07:06.068
farmers. Yeah. They were trying to keep American 
rice out. Sure. I don't know what the process was,

07:11.234 --> 07:15.038
why I was there, but it was really interesting. I 
think they were trying to open the door just to

07:15.895 --> 07:19.580
crime or something, which they had. It's a 
beautiful, beautiful country. Boy, it's a

07:23.686 --> 07:31.538
mixture of evil and violence.

07:31.558 --> 07:31.678
Right. Excuse me. That's all right. So then you're 
in Japan for about a year. Right. Came home in July

07:39.249 --> 07:44.637
of 49. six after spending 18 months overseas and 
got married and entered A&M in the fall. Graduated

07:56.102 --> 08:03.270
in January of 47.

08:03.290 --> 08:06.594
Now, when you came back, you didn't go back and 
record pedestrians. No. No, they didn't. We had a

08:08.476 --> 08:11.540
veterans group. Yeah, that was a tough time. 
Right. That's correct. This was a tough time for

08:15.312 --> 08:17.094
NM. Boy, NM didn't know what it was in those days. We 
had the Board of Regents, I think, was still

08:24.345 --> 08:35.380
holding on to their all-military, but they didn't 
know what to do with the veterans that wanted to

08:24.345 --> 08:35.380
come back. But they, we were separate from the 
Corps. There were a lot of us, many veterans as it

08:42.188 --> 08:49.961
were, in those

08:42.188 --> 08:49.961
days. Did you, you were married while you were 
back? Yes, we were married. Lived in Park Hall. My

08:56.412 --> 09:01.300
wife, my wife became an Aggie during those days. 
She went to school in the east, so she didn't go to

09:01.432 --> 09:08.159
school in Texas either. So it was really nice for 
her to get that experience. She really loved it.

09:14.547 --> 09:19.492
She liked midnight jail practices and going with 
the girls to shop. It was fun. So after graduation,

09:23.557 --> 09:25.759
where did you go? Well, I came back to Houston. And 
my father was in the insurance business. There

09:31.992 --> 09:43.789
again, I didn't know what I wanted to do, but he 
talked me into coming to interview with the

09:31.992 --> 09:43.789
company that he worked for. Who was that? I did. And 
I did, and went to work there. And he and I worked in

09:54.304 --> 10:00.312
the same area. for five or six years, and then we 
decided to form the Lindsay Insurance Agency,

10:00.798 --> 10:10.016
which we did in 1954.

10:10.036 --> 10:13.423
And we've been in that business ever since. You're 
being mechanical. Yes. My father lived for a long

10:16.998 --> 10:19.842
time. He died when he was 90. So, you know, he still 
came to the office a lot during that time. My

10:27.414 --> 10:30.138
brother has an agency in Shreveport. Oh, he does? 
Yeah.

10:35.546 --> 10:35.986
Casualty. They did pretty good up there, in fact. 
You know, they had some really bad years. Right.

10:43.037 --> 10:43.157
Right. Well, we've certainly enjoyed our 
business,

10:44.875 --> 10:54.429
and it's been a great hour of changing. It's the 
kind of business that you can spend as much time as

10:54.870 --> 11:03.062
you want to on it, and then you have time for other 
things, too. Of course, in my lifetime, I need a lot

11:03.343 --> 11:14.359
of time free, and I'm a long way from it.

11:17.360 --> 11:24.187
When did you get re-involved with Texas A&M? Right 
off the bat. It was an interesting thing. I had

11:33.416 --> 11:47.350
heard from a friend of mine that they had every 
money at the Rice Hotel, and my office was in the

11:33.416 --> 11:47.350
Sterling Building, which is right down the street 
about two blocks from Rice. So my first Monday that

11:47.735 --> 11:54.804
I was at work, I went to the Rice Hotel for lunch. And 
the president of the, I didn't know a soul in the

11:55.245 --> 12:10.485
room, the president of the NM Club was asking 
people if anybody had gone to Milby High School and

11:55.245 --> 12:10.485
somebody held up their hand. Just when I walked in, 
I didn't know what they were talking about, and

12:10.853 --> 12:24.151
they said, well, we've got so-and-so and 
so-and-so plays football at Milby, and the coach

12:10.853 --> 12:24.151
wants somebody, one of the alumni, to go by and see 
this guy. And did you do it? Oh, yeah, I'll do it.

12:27.135 --> 12:30.860
Then he said, does anybody here from Lamar High 
School? Nobody held that kind of hand. So there you

12:32.707 --> 12:34.250
are. And that's where I got started. Boy, howdy. I 
had a tiger by the tail on the first one, too. It was

12:42.463 --> 12:49.956
Robert Smith, who was a handbag in high school. i 
stayed with him i'm telling you how sarah my wife

12:51.269 --> 13:19.048
stayed married to me because like this thing but he 
was he was very highly recruited by everybody and

12:51.269 --> 13:19.048
uh won't go into all those details but it was a 
really a tough situation when he ended up losing he

12:51.269 --> 13:19.048
went to two lanes and when he got to two lane he 
didn't like it over there so he called me and said

12:51.269 --> 13:19.048
that uh Did I come over and help him lead Tulane? So 
anyway, we got him out of Tulane and back here. And

13:27.072 --> 13:29.995
got him up to A&M. And he was an All-American 
halfback. He was a great football player. So it was

13:36.261 --> 13:38.963
very, very satisfying. So what year was that? I was 
trying to think. Tulane had some good teams in the

13:41.066 --> 13:44.569
1940s and 50s. Yeah, they sure did. They sure did. 
This was in 40. And Bob Smith went on to,

13:50.062 --> 14:14.010
actually, it was midterm of 48 when he got to A&M, I 
think, because he went to Tulane and went on to...

14:14.767 --> 14:25.606
to go to graduate from Lamar, and then went to 
Tulane, and then at mid-term, I think it was

14:14.767 --> 14:25.606
mid-term that we picked him up at Andrew again. So, 
49 and 50 was one of his big years. Then he went on to

14:29.093 --> 14:35.965
play for the Detroit Lions, professional 
football. Well, I know Aggies, I guess, pretty

14:38.375 --> 14:46.506
well, but why were you so fascinated with 
continuing your A&M activities? I don't know. I

14:47.127 --> 14:47.828
don't know. I just have no idea. Most Aggies don't. 
No, I know. A lot of them don't. But I don't know why.

14:54.096 --> 14:54.777
I don't know why. I did, though, and I liked the 
school, and I liked all my friends up there, and it

14:54.797 --> 15:03.569
was just a fun thing to do. And it still has been for 
you, obviously. And it still has been, still is. It

15:06.893 --> 15:07.756
still is. I can't help but be interested in almost 
everything that happens up there. Let's jump to

15:14.656 --> 15:16.802
the press. Would you first begin to get an idea or 
hear about an A&M Press or get involved with Warren

15:17.626 --> 15:26.198
Law, maybe which came first? It was Buck Shewitz 
and I were good friends and I liked his work and the

15:26.719 --> 15:42.300
course and he and I had become real close. And he 
told me one day, he said, I've got a friend at the

15:42.905 --> 15:52.543
University of Texas that you need to know, that you 
all really like each other. His name is Frank

15:52.563 --> 15:54.927
Wardlaw. And I said, well, Buck, you know, I don't 
go to the University of Texas very often. I don't

16:01.379 --> 16:06.128
know that I'll ever meet him, but if he ever comes 
here, well, I'd like to meet him. Well, he kept

16:06.310 --> 16:10.916
saying, you need to come over to the press and talk 
to him. And Buck had gone over to Austin and visited

16:10.936 --> 16:22.971
the press, and he knew all those people that Frank 
dealt with and some of the authors that were over

16:10.936 --> 16:22.971
there. And Frank was trying to get a book done on 
Buck's fuels. Oh, even before he came over? Right.

16:30.721 --> 16:32.583
Oh, yeah. And I didn't really know that at the time. 
But finally one day, um, Buck called me from

16:35.403 --> 16:53.106
Austin, and he said that they were having a party at 
the UT Press for, um, well, and they just walked,

16:35.403 --> 16:53.106
just walked out here. Who was the great, Dobie? 
Okay, Bessie. Is it Bessie Dobie? Bertha, Bertha

16:57.912 --> 16:59.515
Dobie? Jay Frank Dobie's wife, widow. It's 
Bertha. I believe it's Bertha Dobie. Anyway, they

17:05.618 --> 17:08.541
were having a party for Bertha Dobie. She was still 
living. And the press was having this event, and he

17:11.725 --> 17:18.213
said, John, this is the time for you to come over. I 
want you to meet Bertha, I want you to meet Frank

17:18.354 --> 17:25.603
Waterball, and I want you to meet all these other 
people that are over here. This is a good place of

17:25.623 --> 17:28.326
mine, and I want to meet you. So I reluctantly drove 
over to Austin. What year was

17:34.032 --> 17:40.263
this? Oh, I don't know. It was in the late 60s, I 
guess. 67 or 68, somewhere in there.

17:52.454 --> 18:01.066
I've just forgotten what year that was. But 
anyway, went over there and I had a wonderful time.

18:06.693 --> 18:07.955
And Buck was right. Frank and I hit it off right from 
the very beginning. And I didn't know that Frank

18:12.341 --> 18:20.993
was kind of behind Buck pushing me to come over 
there. And I found out later why he was trying to get

18:21.749 --> 18:25.555
me over there. Because he knew, Frank Warlock knew 
that I had influence with Buck. And he, and finally

18:31.685 --> 18:36.713
he just got me in this, obviously he said, John, I'm 
going to lay it on the table. I want to do a book on

18:36.973 --> 18:39.176
Buck Sheebert's art. And I can't get him, I can't 
nail him down, but I think you can. He said. Right. I

18:48.260 --> 18:57.328
would like for you to do this book and to get some 
pictures, get the pictures of us, and I'm going to

18:48.260 --> 18:57.328
let you run with it. You do pick the ones, you pick 
the pictures, you pick the author, you do the whole

18:57.388 --> 19:05.415
thing. And I would not get in the way. If you do that 
for me, it would be a wonderful, it would just be a

19:06.956 --> 19:13.021
wonderful thing for everybody. And I, of course, 
I've never done anything like that before. But I

19:17.265 --> 19:17.845
agreed to do it. And so that took about a year and a 
half or two years to research that and get those

19:18.145 --> 19:26.957
pictures out. And so we did a book at the UT Press. 
And it has my name all over it. I mean, it's picked by

19:35.209 --> 19:37.952
John Lindsay. And the only book by Shewitz that was 
done by the UT Press. It was fun, though. But in

19:50.622 --> 20:00.699
doing the book,

19:50.622 --> 20:00.699
I took pictures of people, of my friends that had 
them. Poured the picture, told them I just have it,

20:00.719 --> 20:03.724
and gave it back to them. And it happened to be near 
Thanksgiving. And they relate, which I didn't

20:08.163 --> 20:12.689
realize was possible, and it was possible. And the 
pictures were kept over Thanksgiving. And I

20:15.412 --> 20:21.579
remember one of the Victor friends who had her 
out-of-town guest coming, and they had that sheet

20:15.412 --> 20:21.579
which was over the mantel. And they didn't have a 
picture of that over the mantel. No, they chewed me

20:24.903 --> 20:26.485
out for that. I got, oh, they were furious that they 
couldn't get the picture done. Anyway, I got some

20:32.413 --> 20:36.077
very good experience in book publishing. at UT 
Press. Let me ask you now, do you consider yourself

20:37.827 --> 20:41.413
a book person? No. No, I'm not. Yeah, I didn't think 
you were. No, I'm not. I'm not a book person at all.

20:47.262 --> 20:50.708
But I know the value of books, though. And I do 
realize that there are a lot of book people, a lot of

20:50.848 --> 20:56.837
book people. And I do know that... Well, I didn't 
know if you had some secret love affair with books.

21:05.033 --> 21:06.075
No, I don't. It wasn't that at all. This was for the 
Pugsheewitz thing. And I really wasn't thinking

21:12.523 --> 21:21.235
about, at that particular time, I don't know that I 
really thought about the press at A&M, but I really

21:12.523 --> 21:21.235
was just kind of getting used to what a press was, 
what a university press was. It wasn't the same as

21:26.935 --> 21:35.165
some of the big, big press across the country, the 
commercial presses.

21:36.647 --> 21:41.874
But we got that book done, and we laughed and 
celebrated about that. And Frank and I were, Frank

21:41.974 --> 21:45.759
was very appreciative of it. He took, he got us Took 
us hunting. My sons, I have two boys, and he took us

21:50.742 --> 21:54.167
hunting. We went to one of his authors.

22:00.997 --> 22:03.480
I can't think of anybody's name right now. Who did 
Old Yellow?

22:07.987 --> 22:12.974
The book, and it was later a movie, Old Yellow. Oh, I 
should know it too. Anyway, we went to his house.

22:20.395 --> 22:23.138
And my boys just loved it. They had the best time 
hunting with Frank. And then Frank liked

22:27.603 --> 22:28.904
baseball. Bird? Deer? Deer. Deer. Uh-huh. And 
Frank, there's a funny story on that trip. Frank

22:38.435 --> 22:39.696
liked to hunt in the tree. And he would climb up the 
tree and took one of my boys with him. And they were

22:44.522 --> 22:48.546
up in the tree, and Frank told this story himself. 
And my son, they were

22:49.454 --> 23:12.834
up there in the choir and everybody

22:49.454 --> 23:12.834
was singing,

22:49.454 --> 23:12.834
and my son was between them. What are you doing? He 
said, we're waiting for a dinner. And so my son

23:16.257 --> 23:17.438
said, well, what is that? My son was about six or 
seven, I think. This deer had walked up, Frank

23:19.542 --> 23:24.808
didn't even see him. Anyway, that was a funny 
experience. But we had become, then Frank and I had

23:29.434 --> 23:34.300
become friends, too. And he liked baseball, as I 
said, and when the Astros played, I invited Frank

23:35.181 --> 23:44.993
to come down and he brought some of his friends 
down. Gibson, I believe, was

23:45.800 --> 23:54.368
the author of Gibson. But one time, I have a house in 
Galveston, a beach house. And Frank likes to go

24:03.256 --> 24:09.982
anywhere in Texas, wherever it was. He loves 
Texas. He loves to go to the hill country or on the

24:11.284 --> 24:15.047
beach or wherever. So I told him that I'd like to get 
Rosemary

24:15.618 --> 24:24.248
to use my beach house. So I don't remember what year 
that was, but he came to my house in Houston and

24:24.268 --> 24:34.459
spent the night.

24:37.523 --> 24:43.870
And we were just visiting the night before, we went 
out to dinner, nothing special. And at breakfast,

24:44.980 --> 24:48.905
right after breakfast, we had finished 
breakfast. We were sitting, all sitting there. I

24:50.887 --> 24:53.690
was getting ready to go down to my office. And Frank 
was complaining about his board at the University

24:53.710 --> 25:01.700
of Texas. Again, he had done this before. But he 
started on it again, about how the board of

25:04.363 --> 25:13.654
regents, or the president of the university at the 
time, had appointed his press board, advisory

25:13.988 --> 25:23.979
board, and they were all Eastern professors. None 
of them cared about Texana at all. They wanted to do

25:28.744 --> 25:40.637
early Swahili, or East Africa, or some way off, 
very scholarly thing. Which Frank was interested

25:40.938 --> 25:47.966
in, but he was more interested in Texana than 
anything else. And he wanted to have a mix. They did

25:50.529 --> 25:52.371
it. And he kept saying, you know, well, I just, just 
out of the blue, I said, well, Frank, why don't you

25:52.391 --> 26:00.881
jump on them? Why don't you get a bit of all those 
people? And we'll make a happy life for you at A&M.

26:07.209 --> 26:09.171
And you know, Rosemary looked up. He looked up. And 
they, just like

26:11.380 --> 26:20.594
they had the stabbed in the back or something, I 
don't know, but they never said a word. Never said,

26:20.614 --> 26:25.762
no, that's not a good idea, hell no, or anything. 
They never said anything. And so I said, well, I'm

26:28.386 --> 26:31.671
leaving, I've got to go. So I walked out and came 
downtown. And the first thing I got from my

26:38.009 --> 26:43.156
telephone, I called Jack Woodlands. And I said, 
Jack, I've got Frank Warlow at my house in Houston.

26:47.902 --> 26:52.768
He's on the way to my beach house in Galveston. And I 
have just asked

26:52.788 --> 27:00.038
him to come to Texas A&M. And I think we need a press 
there. And Jack said, how much does it cost? That

27:05.024 --> 27:05.866
was his first question. How much does it cost? I 
said, I have no idea what the cost is. But he said, I

27:11.827 --> 27:21.478
said, I think we need to look into it and see what it 
costs. So Jack had a lot on his mind at this

27:22.939 --> 27:28.686
particular time. I don't know what all it was, but 
he had a bunch on his mind. He said, John, I'll tell

27:29.947 --> 27:30.788
you what I'll do. If you give me three members of the 
Board of Regents to say, okay, I will look into it.

27:39.805 --> 27:50.139
So,

27:39.805 --> 27:50.139
I talked to three or four members, and I told them my 
situation was wrong. And they all said, well, how

27:50.159 --> 27:53.724
much does it cost? And I said, well, I don't know how 
much it costs. I said, what we want to do, well,

27:55.827 --> 27:59.372
we're not committing for anything. All we want to 
do is to look into what the cost is and see Yeah,

28:06.029 --> 28:10.558
well, Fort Albritton was one of them. And

28:10.658 --> 28:27.953
Guy King, Waco, and the chairman for 18

28:10.658 --> 28:27.953
years, Clyde Wells. And fortunately Clyde had 
just become, just started collecting rare books.

28:35.353 --> 28:37.455
He was interested in books. And so he, he was, he was 
most interested. He said, well Tom, sounds like a

28:42.942 --> 28:45.785
good idea. Let's, let's do look into that. And I 
said, well if you don't mind, Clyde, I'll just call

28:47.567 --> 28:55.456
Jack and tell him that you were in favor of looking 
into it. And he said, that'll be fine. So I called

28:59.523 --> 29:03.227
Jack back, and it was about three hours later. I 
called him back, and I said, Jack, you got another

29:03.247 --> 29:06.890
job. I got three members, and here they are, and 
they're all interested in finding out how much it

29:07.250 --> 29:15.098
costs.

29:15.118 --> 29:21.664
So he looked into it, and it wasn't really all that 
expensive to get a press started. He was getting

29:21.924 --> 29:27.329
kind of enthusiastic about it. But he had never met 
Frank Wardler. And he'd heard of him. He knew who he

29:31.053 --> 29:31.934
was. Everybody knew who Frank Warhol was. But he 
said, well, how are we going to get to, I want to meet

29:34.938 --> 29:40.585
Frank. And I said, well, let me call him and see. 
Well, no, I'm jumping ahead of the

29:44.470 --> 29:52.821
game.

29:52.841 --> 29:58.909
Frank called me about three days later from my 
house in Galveston during the cocktail hour.

29:59.227 --> 30:00.831
That's what he said, iced tea. It was not iced tea. 
He was drinking some jellies and all that. He had

30:05.281 --> 30:09.410
had two or three and was feeling no pain at all. He 
said, John, he said, you may not remember this, but

30:09.691 --> 30:17.910
he said, you remember the breakfast table the 
other day you suggested? that I leave the

30:17.890 --> 30:32.143
University of Texas at the end of the year, and he 
said, I thought that was, I didn't say anything,

30:17.890 --> 30:32.143
but I thought that was the craziest thing I'd ever 
heard of. I just couldn't think of it. But he said,

30:32.744 --> 30:35.566
I've been thinking about it down here. I've talked 
to Rosemary about it, and you may be surprised to

30:35.586 --> 30:45.315
know that I am, I'm interested in talking about it. 
So I said, fine. I said, we are way ahead of you. He

30:52.208 --> 30:55.292
said, I've already got you in place. And we're 
ready to go. And he said, well, I think that it's got

30:57.455 --> 31:04.725
possibilities. And he said, we'll get together. 
We'll talk about it some more when I get back to

31:07.489 --> 31:11.995
Austin. I never did see him over this thing at this 
time. But then I got the board members to say okay

31:15.620 --> 31:25.594
and Jack said we're ready to go and how do we get 
together with Frank. So I called Frank and said

31:25.614 --> 31:30.582
look, Jack wants to meet you. How would you suggest 
it? Do you want to come over to College Station? Do

31:36.029 --> 31:37.812
you want to come over to Austin? I said Jack has to be 
in Austin. a lot in business. So we could come over

31:43.756 --> 31:50.628
there sometime and I could drive over there and the 
three of us could meet. He said, that sounds like a

31:50.648 --> 31:53.372
deal. And he picked a motel, the Vagabond Motel. It 
was kind of a questionable place, but he said He

32:03.342 --> 32:05.445
didn't want to be seen with us. That's

32:05.965 --> 32:11.172
good. That was kind of the words he used, and I don't 
want Jack Williams and I to be seen together

32:11.192 --> 32:17.200
somewhere. He said, I've still got a job over here, 
and I want to make sure that we don't make any waves.

32:25.872 --> 32:32.320
So we met at the coffee shop of the Vagabond Hotel.

32:34.848 --> 32:43.919
And Jack and I, I drove up to the car station, picked 
up Jack, picked him up, and we met Frank for the

32:34.848 --> 32:43.919
first time. They hit it off real well. And we were 
rolling. And it really was...

32:55.452 --> 33:03.541
There was just nothing in the road to hinder this 
movement. I mean the road was wide open. And Jack

33:05.843 --> 33:08.406
cooperated totally. The Board of Regents 
cooperated totally. Frank got everything he

33:10.788 --> 33:14.452
asked for, whatever he wanted, he got. And they 
were all enthusiastic. That meant he wanted to

33:17.756 --> 33:19.437
find more. Somebody hadn't thought of this 
before. But nobody had Frank Wardlow before. This

33:26.047 --> 33:29.210
guy was, you know, a real new marooner. And was just 
a real catch. I guess anybody really would be proud

33:33.855 --> 33:40.002
to have Frank on campus. Was there any steam, any 
direction in this direction within the former

33:40.022 --> 33:46.549
Students Association per se, through the virus? 
No. They all liked Buck Shewitz. Sure. Buck came

33:50.202 --> 33:55.547
over, and Buck was great, and Buck and Frank were 
close friends. So it was easy. Whoever was a friend

33:56.789 --> 33:59.591
of Buck was a friend of Eric Buck. Now, what about 
the A&M Centennial History paper? Did that enter

34:02.174 --> 34:08.840
into it in any way at this time, or were you even 
aware that it was being developed? No. No, it

34:09.501 --> 34:11.923
didn't have anything to do with this. Okay. It 
didn't have anything to do with this. I'll tell you

34:13.845 --> 34:16.067
another interesting thing, Tony. The first time 
Frank came to College Station, he stayed, Frank

34:16.047 --> 34:27.620
stayed at the Holiday Inn in town. And Buck was 
there. Shewitz was there. He was at the old

34:31.864 --> 34:34.667
Regent's quarters. Remember those visitor rooms 
downstairs? Buck was staying there. So I drove up

34:40.533 --> 34:48.873
and I took Rosemary and Frank out to dinner, just 
the five of us. And I had Rosemary and Frank in my car

34:48.894 --> 34:58.457
and I drove up to the side of the old Regent's 
Quarters and Frank looked out the window and he

34:48.894 --> 34:58.457
said, what is this? And I said, this is the old Board 
of Regents house. It's kind of not in really too

35:04.638 --> 35:07.882
good shape. The Board of Regents wasn't using it. 
It was really not good. But she had a place, a free

35:12.829 --> 35:15.833
place to stay. And that's where he was using the 
bedroom downstairs. Well, I got out of the car and

35:19.818 --> 35:25.485
went in, got Buck, and we were coming out the door. 
And when I came out of the door, Frank and Rosemary

35:25.505 --> 35:34.637
had gotten out of my car and had walked all the way 
around the front of this house and around the back.

35:36.679 --> 35:38.341
And he hardly spoke to Buck. I mean, he said hello, I 
guess, but he said, listen, I want to know about

35:39.002 --> 35:43.267
this house. What's it used for now? And I said, 
well, it's not used for anything. I think we're

35:48.113 --> 35:49.335
going to probably tear it down. Oh, he said, no, you 
can't tear this house down. He said, this is where I

35:52.926 --> 35:54.968
want the press. I mean, he said that. He said, this 
is where I want the press. And I said, well, gosh,

35:58.993 --> 36:09.265
Mike, I had no idea that what kind of a building a 
press wanted anyway. I never thought of it that

36:09.345 --> 36:13.350
he'd want this kind of a building. But when he, that 
was the first thing he talked, when he saw Jack the

36:13.370 --> 36:19.677
next day, he said, I found a place. That's amazing. 
And that's where it was. He loved that house. His

36:29.107 --> 36:31.009
letters were just full of that. He was so happy. He 
really was. And that really did help him cement the

36:33.492 --> 36:40.500
relationship with A&M. Everything just fell into 
place. The opportunity was right. He really was

36:43.703 --> 36:46.470
disgruntled about Texas. In fact, that's the word 
he used about the faculty earlier. He said they're

36:49.998 --> 36:51.221
disgruntled. And Spur, I think, was the 
president. Yeah, that's right. That's right.

36:57.558 --> 37:02.887
Now, one of the first things Brian did when he got 
back in was got back to A&M. I bet you think it's a

37:02.987 --> 37:06.212
good story before that. Yeah. He's organized this 
advisory committee. Right, right, right. And you

37:10.299 --> 37:13.885
are probably a bit ahead of that. I wasn't. I wasn't 
ahead of it. I was long ahead of it, yeah. Okay. Now,

37:18.232 --> 37:19.374
what was its approach? Was it primarily money 
raising? Well, money raising, yeah. Okay. Yeah.

37:23.748 --> 37:31.699
He told me about how he got these, he would get 
people and they would sponsor a series. Sponsor a

37:31.719 --> 37:36.846
series and then he would go back into it.

37:38.629 --> 37:43.896
And I introduced him to, I guess, all the people 
that did the series. Ken Montague. I introduced

37:44.657 --> 37:46.920
him to Joe Moore, too. They have a place in Hawaii. 
Frank had an art series he wanted to do and I had the

37:51.383 --> 37:58.455
money and I had done it. But I didn't at that time

37:59.316 --> 38:11.676
and I'm pretty well committed. You know he made 
more than the R3.

38:19.516 --> 38:20.317
Pugh? Well, he came from the DuPonté. DuPonté 
introduced it to Pugh. Okay. And Pugh didn't want

38:26.646 --> 38:28.589
his name involved. Right. That's correct. That's 
correct. That's correct. He didn't want other

38:31.734 --> 38:34.758
people getting DuPonté. That's probably what he 
wanted. He just didn't want everybody

38:37.883 --> 38:41.528
soliciting. Yeah, now with these, were you 
personally involved? Oh, yeah. He was a good

38:49.065 --> 38:50.348
friend of mine. I said, look, I want to take you to 
lunch. I want you to meet Frank Wardlaw. We want to

38:53.475 --> 38:54.657
talk about books. And he said, you know, and Frank 
was, I mean, that kid was one. Where was Montague?

39:01.198 --> 39:02.100
Was he in Houston? Houston, yeah. Okay. He was in 
Houston. And he came, and I'm sure he had no idea of

39:05.926 --> 39:11.996
ever doing anything like that either, and neither 
did I. But he came up and we did it. That's another

39:16.804 --> 39:20.931
thing that Wardolph mentioned in his letters 
quite a lot, you know, Aggies, former students,

39:21.333 --> 39:24.897
really believe this is their press. That's 
correct. That's correct. They bought books. He

39:27.380 --> 39:28.381
was enchanted with that. Right. They were 
interested and they bought books. But a press,

39:31.024 --> 39:33.447
college press, is really a hard sell. Yes, it is. It 
is. Faculty don't really appreciate it. I don't

39:38.373 --> 39:40.295
think adequately. I think you're right. I think 
you're right. I think we're better known outside

39:42.458 --> 39:44.961
the... outside of our own place and we are in the 
place yeah and i think some of the letters frank's

39:45.380 --> 40:08.434
letters are the reflex of this uh-huh symptoms 
really of any

39:45.380 --> 40:08.434
universal class well that's uh didn't know a lot of 
people in Houston. In fact, they kept Tim Cannon

40:11.844 --> 40:17.213
under wraps over there. Frank was, he really 
wasn't treated as a first-class citizen. Oh, we

40:23.303 --> 40:24.825
sure did. And he just loved it. He reported 
directly to the President and everything he

40:27.570 --> 40:33.499
wanted, he got. And he couldn't have been happier. 
I'm sure he was walking into this world of academia

40:35.667 --> 40:46.499
without a degree and all that, and you get the whole 
complex as he did at Texas later. They just changed

40:46.559 --> 40:51.665
their world beautifully. But that's what makes 
Frank Wardlaw a great man. He became Dwight and

40:55.589 --> 40:57.331
Aggie. He really did. He was a great publisher. So 
the series, now the... The Centennial Series

41:03.511 --> 41:07.868
money, I know, got dumped back into the press. Were 
you involved in that decision at all? No. I don't

41:14.092 --> 41:19.360
think of the decision to publish it, or... Well, 
no, I mean funding the money. No. I mean, the

41:19.721 --> 41:22.024
Department of Students put up $75,000, I think. 
Right, I may have, you know, been there, but I don't

41:22.265 --> 41:29.115
know, I don't have any special recollection about 
that. Then another key that Frank was very

41:29.135 --> 41:34.243
interested in, and I guess Williams, Was this 
$200,000, what do you call it, revolving fund or

41:34.223 --> 41:41.373
something? I think that came out straight out of 
university. Right. That's correct. That's

41:44.978 --> 41:45.539
correct. Do you have any recollection of that? I 
just remember that that was what Board of Regents

41:48.784 --> 41:55.253
had decided and Frank had. They approved it, but it 
was Frank's number. He got the number together,

41:59.218 --> 42:04.285
and he asked for that number, and that's what they 
gave him. They gave him what he asked for. And it

42:05.827 --> 42:08.431
kind of got spooky there, even after he got over 
here. That's right. We got more. So we got more for

42:11.896 --> 42:13.318
him. Then when, of course, we had the fire, and that 
was terrible, and he lived in those open homes

42:14.739 --> 42:24.733
there in the back. And we had a real serious time, 
and Frank said, we've got to do something. He lived

42:34.090 --> 42:37.876
in a small home, so he went back to Jack and said, 
look, we need a building. Of course, we've got a

42:39.619 --> 42:44.908
building that no other press in the country has 
until this day. We've got the best looking

42:45.049 --> 42:50.518
building that anybody, any press ever had. When 
you went back to Williams now, what was the

42:52.928 --> 43:00.436
reception when you turned to the new building? 
I've got a lot of articles. It was just a moment. He

43:02.218 --> 43:04.881
said, it's no problem. It's high on the agendas. 
We're going to give you a new building. We just got

43:09.526 --> 43:13.170
to wait for the proper time for the money and all. 
There never was any question. about the new

43:15.912 --> 43:18.035
building. Nobody said, you're going to go in the 
basement of this building over here. Frank said,

43:22.741 --> 43:24.403
no, I don't want to do that. I don't want to move. I 
want to stay on the lot. The mobile home was his

43:29.190 --> 43:31.813
idea. To stay on the site of the burned out 
building. And the mobile homes were right there in

43:37.741 --> 43:39.564
the back. And he said, we'll just stay right here. 
In fact, the garage of the of the Board of Regents

43:46.422 --> 43:51.876
Quarters was our storage books, and we get more 
books now. i think about it it's just unbelievable

43:53.037 --> 44:16.497
compared to what we've got today now frank was 
planning it just kind of surprised him planning

43:53.037 --> 44:16.497
his retirement about the day he hit yeah texas 
right yeah he told me he said i was planning to

43:53.037 --> 44:16.497
retire oh he he was uh he had this thing all figured 
out what he's gonna do how he's gonna do it right and

43:53.037 --> 44:16.497
he went down and got lloyd lineman Right. You had to 
replace him. That's right. I don't even know if

44:18.684 --> 44:21.167
Lloyd knew that at the time he was hired. I don't 
know that he did either. I'm not sure. But he told me

44:24.591 --> 44:27.916
that that would be his replacement. Yeah. Lloyd 
Lyman was a great book man, and he would be his

44:28.116 --> 44:33.122
replacement. And he was just fabulous. Yeah. I was 
crazy about Lloyd, too. I'm going to go try to go out

44:37.188 --> 44:39.070
and see him. Are you? Next month, yeah. We still 
talk every day. Do you? Uh-huh. Yeah. I send him A&M

44:43.696 --> 44:47.381
material from time to time. Really, I'll send him 
this. I will. I'll send him this Texas Monthly

44:48.883 --> 44:50.726
thing. I've got a copy that we bought, and I'll send 
it to him. I'm going to send Lloyd a copy of it. He'd

44:57.335 --> 44:57.876
like to read that. Once in a while we talk. Not a lot, 
though. He called about a year ago. No, I don't talk

45:00.740 --> 45:03.664
to him a lot, either. But I always like learning. I 
do, too. Interesting guy. So the new building, I

45:10.460 --> 45:14.886
think I'm pretty well fixed on the dedication. 
They went forward and did a good job. Lloyd did a

45:16.508 --> 45:17.329
good job. Did a good job. He really did. Wonderful 
job. And that kind of surprised me, because I never

45:20.453 --> 45:26.901
thought of Lloyd as an organization member, but he 
did well. He really had a good front of the matter.

45:30.906 --> 45:31.286
He sure did. And the dedication of the building? 
Real good, yeah. Yeah, wasn't that wonderful?

45:34.551 --> 45:36.733
That was nice of him. And Fort Auburn and the 
helicopter, you remember? I don't remember the

45:40.362 --> 45:42.165
helicopter. Ford brought a helicopter in and 
everybody wanted to ride. We flew around the

45:47.233 --> 45:49.076
campus and all. I wasn't even there. I was gone. 
I've got a picture. We can't have been gone to

45:56.629 --> 45:58.552
Europe.

46:03.079 --> 46:03.861
We've got a big trip. Three, four...

46:09.218 --> 46:11.561
I look at this all the time. I can't think of that 
day. This is a picture of my son and I right in front

46:13.103 --> 46:17.369
of that helicopter on that day. Oh, okay. That's 
why the helicopter, the pictures are in the

46:18.110 --> 46:21.214
archive there too. Yeah. At the print. That was 
such a neat thing. He just came up with that idea and

46:25.300 --> 46:33.110
it was just really neat. Neat idea.

46:36.556 --> 46:37.437
He's a great guy. He's one of my dearest friends. 
That's a picture of he and I over there with my bell

46:39.218 --> 46:45.204
in the Auburn Tower. Oh, okay. My name is on one of 
those bells. Is it really? I didn't know that. Most

46:55.793 --> 47:02.039
of the bells, there are 49 bells, and I think 15 of 
them have names on them. Most of them are his

47:02.059 --> 47:05.922
family, except Jack.
