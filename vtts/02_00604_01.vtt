00:05.448 --> 00:09.140
In the morning I was shooting records in the house.

00:11.006 --> 00:13.213
And the big gun shot. to portray us. The big gun is 
shot, so I bide kindly back up in the house. The

00:20.430 --> 00:24.717
overseer asks me, what is that up that is thunder? I 
tell him, I don't know. I know what the amp is. And so

00:28.803 --> 00:36.535
he shot three times, and he commenced to shoot, 
until the pit commenced to rattle on the field. And

00:36.852 --> 00:46.306
he called me and told me to run down in the field and 
tell Peter to turn the people loose, that the

00:36.852 --> 00:46.306
Yankees come. And so I ran down in the field and 
hooped and hollered at him, Peter, and told him,

00:47.628 --> 00:58.184
Mr. Giggles, he'll turn the people loose because 
the Yankees come. The driver. And so he said that

01:00.067 --> 01:05.195
Wallace was lying. He said so. Like he said, so then 
the Yankee beat to the land and they drunk. You

01:10.653 --> 01:14.839
understand, they down south gettin' mighty poor. 
They used to drink coffee but now they drink dry.

01:17.744 --> 01:21.610
They say, let's raise the uniband, make the rebel 
understand. To leave our land for the sake of Uncle

01:21.630 --> 01:24.955
Sam. They down south gettin' mighty poor. Shut out 
the white cat and see the rebel run. I ain't gonna go

01:30.043 --> 01:34.089
with them two again. I'll get over all of them. Yes. 
And that, the people then show where they go then.

01:42.100 --> 01:49.815
They show where they go and they call we all up, you 
know, and give you all freedom. Because we are this

01:49.835 --> 01:52.320
much as free as them. Now you understand. But the 
Yankee thing must go back to the South there, help

01:54.524 --> 01:57.948
me. But they didn't. Of course, there was so much 
doubt and things in the way. They would have done

02:02.633 --> 02:04.556
more. But there's so much doubt in the way. It 
couldn't be called. The colored people sure went

02:08.921 --> 02:11.724
for it. And some white people sure went for it too. 
You understand? And the redder had them and had me.

02:21.715 --> 02:22.476
I'm satisfied so far. What the Lord has done for me, 
I come through to all who've been up and down

02:23.131 --> 02:30.956
through the militia. Well, tell me about how they 
went to Hawkinsville and drove the sword down on

02:30.976 --> 02:34.387
the ground. They told them, they know you.

02:40.681 --> 02:45.027
What do you remember about when slavery was over? 
You stayed at home when you stayed? I can't tell you

02:45.808 --> 02:47.551
about that. Well, hadn't you said you'd stay, 
okay? Go on, tell me about coming through here with

02:48.993 --> 02:51.397
cannons. Yes, yes. No, I'll tell you a mistake. Way 
back in slavery time, I would stand after the

02:53.560 --> 03:01.892
people were free. I would go out every day, right in 
town, to see the Yankees all going back home. I can

03:10.921 --> 03:27.975
really disagree that they have six and eight moons 
to count, going through, and boats on them,

03:10.921 --> 03:27.975
counting, counting, then they put the wagon, and 
have boats all on them wagon. What would it mean?

03:32.099 --> 03:32.820
Have a little mule. And one man, I ride him, ride the 
two mules. We always take a look at him. Have a look

03:38.168 --> 03:38.669
at him. All day long, I'd be crossing. I would just, 
well, and all the Yankees, I'd be like, dressed in

03:40.712 --> 03:45.279
blue clothes. I can remember, we'd go jump right 
here, and have a little pillow on the coat right

03:46.100 --> 03:57.117
there, in the background, and courses up there. I 
would go just as well, just to come down, and

03:57.517 --> 04:00.722
then... Black men have maybe, oh, I don't know how 
many black horses. Then they come along again with

04:06.536 --> 04:11.484
all these old green men on it. This is them cameras. 
And then they come back with horses, saw horses.

04:17.093 --> 04:18.576
All these have all gone to town. That way for two 
days, they've gone out to town for two days. And I

04:22.181 --> 04:25.647
remember, and the Yankees stopped here. And the 
maggots stopped right on the corner of the square.

04:30.176 --> 04:31.717
I was a good-sized boy then. And what they called 
freedom dealers, you know what I'm saying? And the

04:36.903 --> 04:41.769
prosecuting people, you know, what they do, you 
know, and all like that. And I regret hardly to call

04:42.049 --> 04:43.831
them. I've seen two men they had that were 
punishing for what they do. And I've seen them take

04:48.917 --> 04:50.959
them. That had a little big tent. We boys would go 
out and see him. And they'd take him, hang him up

04:55.485 --> 04:56.987
with a slum. And they'd let the tip, at that time, 
hang out so many men, they'd let him down. That's

05:03.018 --> 05:04.341
the punishment they got. We'd let the old man, he 
hadn't come, an old dead, his name was Yankee

05:05.783 --> 05:12.195
White. And the man, the judge's name,

05:18.462 --> 05:19.744
I forgot his name. But then I knew he looked like 
Yankee White. That's what he used to do when he was

05:22.567 --> 05:23.789
young. Well, then they come, and my old master, 
O'Connor McRae, he brought two of the horses for

05:23.809 --> 05:34.363
him. I rode the horse many times. One of them was a 
big horse they called Yankee Tom, a big, solid

05:36.766 --> 05:41.052
horse. And another big old horse was a saddle horse 
O'Connor McRae bought, and he was called Boston.

05:46.399 --> 05:48.081
He was a good, big, black horse. He took them all 
down to the farm. He took all of that. Good big boys,

05:52.784 --> 05:55.147
eh? Good big boys. And the Yankees would come, and 
at the fire, there'd be a whole troop of men come.

06:02.437 --> 06:04.921
They said they were Yankees. All walking. All 
walking. That crew of Yankees would go soon. Next

06:11.911 --> 06:16.717
time you see, there'd come a whole troop of 
Yankees. All riding horses. big guns hanging on

06:18.790 --> 06:22.155
there, all that stuff, you know. The oldest, 
tenderest man, all going home. And I said, I asked

06:26.461 --> 06:31.048
him, I said, I said, I said, Mama, where are they 
going? He said, they're all going home now. And old

06:33.211 --> 06:36.496
Colonel Crater, his old master, he was looking at 
it. He said, well, hey, all of you niggas is all free

06:36.516 --> 06:39.360
now. Yankees are all going home. I remember I got 
dishes for you. Right, right in town. So while we

06:45.729 --> 06:48.173
lived there, right where we knew The new post 
office. That's my old master's home. Up above the

06:54.462 --> 06:56.965
old post office. Well, that is his square. From 
that post office, clean down to the Citizen Bank.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.676
Oh, that is his whole square now. And clean over to 
the other part. Come out on up to the Church. That's

07:09.982 --> 07:12.124
my old master's place. I can remember he was a 
speculator. I can remember a good big boy then.

07:17.212 --> 07:20.875
They had a big old shed there. And they had cotton 
all in that shed. And we boys all got put on that shed

07:23.558 --> 07:27.181
every day. And they had wagons there. Every day 
he'd load up all them wagons and take all that

07:29.103 --> 07:33.106
cotton and go. Now you see, that was in slavery 
time. And he'd bring back a whole lot of colored

07:38.991 --> 07:42.134
people. They said he was a specklehead. And he'd 
sell them to all these people around this town.

07:48.541 --> 07:50.864
There's a lot of old people all dead now, but he 
brought them too. We'd all go up and bring them in.

07:55.450 --> 07:56.432
Oh, you look over there. My old, my old, my old papa 
was a wagoner. I used to go, he used to carry me with

08:01.339 --> 08:03.301
him all the time. Used to haul cotton, cat cotton, 
and jasmine to wire this bluff. And, and cat

08:10.992 --> 08:14.016
cotton, wire this, and this cat cotton, Over here, 
there's a place called...

08:20.669 --> 08:21.630
I forgot the place now. I can't come down there. I 
remember he used to be here. I was a good big boy at

08:25.554 --> 08:27.436
the time. And he had an auction. He had an auction. 
He had an old auction named Brandy. I thought, how

08:32.241 --> 08:34.103
come there's this wagon up? He'd get tired and sit 
down and build. Oh, yes, sir. Get on up. Get this

08:38.027 --> 08:38.568
one. Get on. And I'd ride old Brandy. Ride old 
Brandy and drive the rest of them. Right here, so I

08:44.135 --> 08:49.280
tried to get down and walk right on down. I'd be 
like, oh, Nick, I've been through a heap. A heap,

08:50.861 --> 08:52.443
all of that stuff. That didn't save a time. That 
didn't save a time. And I remember, I can tell you

08:55.706 --> 08:58.128
what saved a time. Right down, I can tell you this, 
if I can. Right down close to Mr. Nicky Mays' place,

09:04.754 --> 09:10.379
there was no jailhouse on. Old, long jailhouse. 
Over all jailhouses now. That's the only, that's

09:16.018 --> 09:23.390
the only, that's the only, and there was no, there 
was no, some kind of a courthouse. I rejected. And

09:24.592 --> 09:27.838
they used to put prisoners in that jailhouse. And 
me, me, and another young white fellow was raised

09:27.858 --> 09:33.928
in there, and call him a cray and hand him on. And we 
used to go home, the people that owned some things,

09:34.709 --> 09:39.437
we used to go home and steal. braid the stuff and 
focus with them little bars to the prisoners with

09:40.042 --> 10:05.897
the boys that's why i can't juggle and there's no 
old jailhouse and all around our place and i regret

09:40.042 --> 10:05.897
one time we all was looking at it and they brought in 
they had hounds and they broke down hounding and

09:40.042 --> 10:05.897
broke three needles with the hound lovely knees 
you know cutting wood and they Right across the

10:06.434 --> 10:31.935
creek there, they take them niggas and put them on 
the log and put them on the log and put them on the log

10:06.434 --> 10:31.935
and put them on the log and put them on the log and put 
them on the log and put them on the log and put them on

10:06.434 --> 10:31.935
the log and put them on the log and put them on the log 
and put them on the log and put them on the log

10:36.674 --> 10:44.524
What's

10:36.674 --> 10:44.524
that you said? What is that you said, Uncle Bob? 
What about? Then, the machine went off and I didn't

10:49.447 --> 10:52.572
hear you. I said, I'm glad Noah got acquainted with 
you because I believe he's a good man and I want him

10:52.932 --> 10:59.602
to be with a good man. Well, tell me, where were you 
born, Uncle Bob? I was born not far from this place,

11:02.907 --> 11:09.516
up here south, west of here, about five miles. And 
how old are you? Well, now, I told you about over the

11:11.748 --> 11:17.395
December, 7th of summer, two or three. My daddy 
told me I was 19 years old on the 18th of December.

11:27.406 --> 11:28.948
And that's all I can go by. 18th of December when? 
Well, 1880. Yeah. And you don't know how to figure

11:35.973 --> 11:40.079
how much that is that makes you now? No, sir. I'm a 
full freedom.

11:53.399 --> 11:59.088
You told me a story or two about yourself and about 
your father as we came along. What was it? Well,

12:00.289 --> 12:05.457
just mention it so I know what you're talking 
about, and I can start it over with you and I'll read

12:00.289 --> 12:05.457
it. Well, was your father a songster like you? 
Nothing more than hymns, hymns. He was a regular

12:12.559 --> 12:14.182
church man. Well, what kind of songs did you sing 
when you were young? Well, I didn't just holler

12:18.129 --> 12:25.042
reels, just fiddle reels, you know, all the time, 
my singing. Were you a fiddler yourself? No, sir,

12:26.444 --> 12:28.648
no, sir. I couldn't make no music at all. Well, you 
could make music with your mouth. Oh, yes, I could

12:34.384 --> 12:35.785
do that. I sure would do that. Everywhere you'd 
hear me, you'd hear me singing a song, a reel. And

12:42.432 --> 12:44.854
out in the field, what'd you do when you were 
working? That's what I'd do, hollering, singing

12:44.974 --> 12:47.396
reels. And what was it you sang about the cotton? 
About Little Joe? Yeah. Little Joe. My son told me

12:56.265 --> 12:58.487
to pick a little cotton. The boy said, done for the 
seeds all rotted. Well, I said it just like you did

13:01.681 --> 13:04.244
to me in the car. I said it louder. My son told me to 
pick a little sun before he set down. Seat's all

13:11.172 --> 13:12.393
rotten. Get out of the way, old man. Tucker comes 
too late to kick through a slipper. I don't believe

13:18.300 --> 13:20.722
I heard you sing it. Well, how did you tell me you 
used to call your sweetheart out at night? Let me

13:24.767 --> 13:25.267
see. I nearly forgot what I was supposed to holler. 
What's all the hollering for? In hollering. They

13:30.487 --> 13:33.570
tell me one word every so often, what they're 
talking about. They said you didn't have any

13:33.590 --> 13:35.913
starch or salt. Yes. No salt. Louder. Sing it 
louder. No salt. No starch. Nobody to wash my

13:48.585 --> 13:53.270
clothes. Nobody to wash my clothes. I hate to say 
it, but my voice, it broke. Well, didn't you say you

14:00.895 --> 14:04.160
used to sing that in the field, too? Yeah, I sang 
that in the field, too. Yes. Would your sweetheart

14:07.525 --> 14:09.909
be out there in the field? No, she'd be joining. 
Joining fields, you know. Uh-huh. Well, what were

14:16.379 --> 14:19.984
some of the other old field hollers that you used to 
have? When you, I'm going home, I'm going home,

14:21.955 --> 14:34.106
I'm going home. I was one of them. Well, when you 
wanted to, when you wanted to summon a boy from

14:37.409 --> 14:45.217
across the creek, way far off, how would you, how 
would you notify? I just hollered, I hollered, you

14:45.237 --> 14:49.040
hear me holler, and he'd answer me way, way on. 
Well, what was the holler? That same thing I'll

14:51.638 --> 14:53.360
sing. No snow. No sky. Nobody to wash my clothes. 
Nobody to wash my clothes. The same old horror. And

15:08.335 --> 15:12.279
he danced way out of his field. What'd he say? 
Ma'am? What would he say? Well, he'd say the same

15:15.863 --> 15:17.805
thing. And how would he sing it? Sing it like he did. 
No sun, no stars. Nobody to wash my clothes. Nobody

15:32.496 --> 15:36.301
to wash my clothes. And if he took a notion, then 
he'd say, I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going

15:48.476 --> 15:48.996
home. I know that he'd come as soon as he got supper. 
It's a white folk kitchen. I'm looking for him.

15:56.968 --> 16:03.040
Now, you told me about the man that you worked for 
for 10 or 12 years, Mr. Norwood. And you said he's

16:03.301 --> 16:05.665
the meanest man in the country. Well, they said so. 
Them Norwoods worked for the meanest people in the

16:07.389 --> 16:10.836
world around them. Well, how did it treat you? It 
treated me all right. The nine one of them never did

16:15.833 --> 16:19.579
cuss at me the whole 12 years. I didn't care what I 
went to them for, I got it. Bowels of flour, middles

16:23.265 --> 16:27.913
of meat, chags of molasses, money any time. Now 
that Judge Noah, as the oldest boy, if his store

16:29.159 --> 16:38.348
would be full of hands, you know, he was more than 
old to know what he was doing. I'd just tell him,

16:39.009 --> 16:41.271
give me a pencil and a piece of paper. He'd hand it to 
me, and I'd write it on there and tell him, I want a $5

16:41.631 --> 16:45.235
piece of it. I'd hand it to him, go on by my business. 
First thing you know, he'd come on by me, text me,

16:47.978 --> 16:50.900
and give it to me. He'd do me that way just to show me, 
just to show me that I'm a leader. What was it the old

16:57.593 --> 17:01.499
merchant, what was it the old merchant told you? 
You told the old merchant down here, Mr.

17:01.519 --> 17:06.065
Mooringford. Me and him was talking down one day 
and wasn't nobody in there but me. I say exactly

17:11.913 --> 17:14.197
what you said now. Yes, but wasn't nobody in there 
but me and him and his son and his son's daughter.

17:20.586 --> 17:22.268
And I said, Mr. Corrigan, I forgot exactly how old I 
was, but anyhow, I said, I'm 61 or two years old, and

17:22.720 --> 17:31.952
I never had no trouble in my life. I said, I never 
asked the noise for nickel, but they didn't give it

17:32.593 --> 17:38.020
to me, in my life. And that one of them never 
accosted me. And said, I ain't never been

17:40.843 --> 17:51.377
summoned, and ain't never been arrested, and 
ain't never been to the jailhouse but twice in my

17:40.843 --> 17:51.377
life, and ain't been to the courthouse but twice. 
He looked at me and cooked. He said, well, Bob, I'm

17:54.337 --> 17:55.980
down. That ain't too much for a nigga to say. He 
said, ain't no white man can say any better than

17:58.144 --> 18:01.890
that. He said, ain't. I said, well, I'm telling you 
the truth. I said, you can ask these people all

18:04.294 --> 18:11.847
around the school that know me, and they'll tell 
you I ain't never been in no trouble since I've been

18:04.294 --> 18:11.847
there. Well, you said you hadn't been to the 
jailhouse before. Did they put you in jail or what?

18:17.553 --> 18:19.095
No, I just went by there. Went by the jail? Down the 
street, yes. Well, when you had friends in jail,

18:21.878 --> 18:24.561
didn't you go to see them? I didn't go to see them 
because I always said, practice makes perfect. I

18:29.926 --> 18:32.569
cried, I said so, and I just wouldn't go to see them. 
I said, no, I ain't going to see them. I said,

18:34.671 --> 18:36.353
practice makes perfect. I ain't going there. The 
Lord knows I'm telling you the truth, what I said.

18:42.320 --> 18:46.045
Uh, uh, how much, uh, how much school did you go to? I 
never went to school a day in my life, not an hour.

18:53.035 --> 18:58.083
Hey, hey, hey, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, yeah. 
How you both feeling? Well, nobody here can tell

19:02.429 --> 19:07.957
you I never went to school an hour in my life. Well, 
uh... Well, go ahead. Dr. Noah, I never went to

19:12.323 --> 19:18.409
school an hour in my life. Not an hour. Well, then 
could you read and write? I could read and write,

19:25.736 --> 19:27.758
too. I could send a letter all over this world if I 
just knew where to send it. Of course, I can't write

19:32.122 --> 19:38.128
it pretty like people do, but anywhere I know where 
to send it, I can send it. Well, how'd you learn to

19:39.442 --> 19:41.084
write? Well, my daddy just taught me how to spell a 
little at night. Well, after that, then he took a

19:45.810 --> 19:51.036
corpus, and I took a corpus and just learned 
myself.

19:56.002 --> 19:57.204
And how'd you learn to read? Well, he learned at 
night. He said he wasn't no educated man. He could

20:01.829 --> 20:05.474
just read print, and he'd sit up at night and teach 
his children. That's the way we learned. I heard a

20:09.884 --> 20:15.793
story about a judge asking a colored boy on the 
witness stand. He said, Jim, can you read writing?

20:19.759 --> 20:21.221
He said, no, sir, judge. I can't even read reading. 
But you can read reading and write and go. And they

20:31.637 --> 20:37.967
had a preacher who was trying to make a preacher out 
of him. And I asked him, could he, did he know, did he

20:38.521 --> 20:41.825
know theology? He said, no, sir, I never knew that 
man in my life. I never been crazy with him. So I

20:49.535 --> 20:53.019
don't know about no, nothing like that. How old 
were you when you joined the church? I was 19 years

20:59.908 --> 21:05.675
old. And how old were you when you got married? Oh. 
Just in between it. Just started in between it.

21:13.470 --> 21:15.673
Well, did your wife make you join the church? No, 
sir. Let's join myself. Let's tuck a motion and

21:18.758 --> 21:20.681
join myself. Well, how have you got along so well in 
life? What's been your principles? Well, people

21:27.231 --> 21:29.054
are after people. Anybody you know around here 
hasn't bought my principles. I just went on. I just

21:34.201 --> 21:39.010
like and know what a right to do and I always try to do 
what's right.

21:43.037 --> 21:45.041
Well, that's a mighty good way to do it, Pa. Yes, 
sir. I know what's right and I try my best to do

21:46.003 --> 21:52.435
what's right in everything I do. How many times 
have you voted? Ain't voted but twice. vote for who

21:56.838 --> 22:10.955
she wants, and vote for who the President of

21:56.838 --> 22:10.955
the United States wants. Ms. Irene Williams 
continues her singing on this record.

22:17.063 --> 22:22.930
Another very interesting thing in my early 
childhood was the Negro baptizing. All the

22:23.838 --> 22:35.557
candidates for baptism were standing on the bank 
of the pond over in Mr. Bailey's pasture, dressed

22:23.838 --> 22:35.557
in long white gowns with white caps on their heads, 
ready to be buried in baptism. And their song, as

22:35.597 --> 22:41.347
they were being led into the water by the minister, 
was this.

22:43.971 --> 22:44.732
Oh, glory. Keep your lamp a-trimmed and a-burning 
Keep your lamp a-trimmed and a-burning Keep your

22:46.838 --> 23:14.162
lamp a-trimmed and a-burning Just like the light 
of God

22:46.838 --> 23:14.162
Oh, sisters Keep your lamp a-trimmed and 
a-burning Keep your lamp a-trimmed and

23:14.530 --> 23:18.155
a-burning. Keep your lamp a-trimmed and 
a-burning. Just like the light of God.

23:30.714 --> 23:32.035
Oh, no, no. Keep your lamp a-trimmed and 
a-burning. Keep your lamp a-trimmed and

23:36.822 --> 23:40.307
a-burning. Keep your lamp a-trimmed and 
a-burning. Just like the light of God.

23:50.363 --> 23:56.873
Oh, sinners, keep your lamp a-trimmed and 
a-burning. Keep your lamp a-trimmed and

23:57.241 --> 24:09.118
a-burning, keep your lamp a-trimmed and 
a-burning, just like the light of God.

24:11.982 --> 24:17.750
And another thing that I remember on the 
plantation that we hadn't mentioned before was

24:11.982 --> 24:17.750
the churning song. Little Emma, the baby's nurse, 
after the baby was tucked in bed, was often called

24:18.792 --> 24:26.623
in the kitchen to do the churning. And this is a song 
that she sang to the milk. Come, butter, come, Mr.

24:31.200 --> 24:39.268
standing at the gate, waiting for the butter cake 
to come, butter, come. Come, butter, come, Mr. is

24:39.729 --> 24:42.692
waiting. Come, butter, come, Mr. is waiting. 
Come, butter, come, the Mrs. is waiting. Come,

24:49.138 --> 24:52.121
butter, come, the Mrs. is waiting. Mrs. is waiting 
for the butter cake to come, butter, come. And

24:55.645 --> 25:16.287
this

24:55.645 --> 25:16.287
chant would go on through until the churning was 
finished and the rich golden butter would come

24:55.645 --> 25:16.287
into a solid cake on the top of the mill.

25:27.016 --> 25:29.799
the meeting day at Oak Grove Church. The first 
Sunday in August was a gala occasion for the

25:29.819 --> 25:33.985
Negroes on the place. That was the day the big 
practice meeting began over at Oak Grove Baptist

25:34.766 --> 25:47.661
Church, a day of parade for the new dresses, new 
suits, new hats, for each Negro was dressed out in

25:34.766 --> 25:47.661
his Sunday dress. About 10 o'clock in the morning, 
they would be on their way to church, And it looked

25:52.700 --> 26:06.148
as if the divets of white, pink, blue, red, yellow, 
and the variegated colors had outrivaled

25:52.700 --> 26:06.148
themselves in putting out the brightest colors of 
which their dresses were made from. Every pattern

26:07.371 --> 26:12.902
wrote on the plate was filled with those who were 
going to church. and the woods rang with their joy

26:13.523 --> 26:18.729
and happiness and their calls to each other. 
Morning there, Sister Maisie. How's y'all? Oh,

26:22.653 --> 26:24.315
I'se tired but well, thank you. How's y'all? 
That's sure am a pretty dress what you got on.

26:29.601 --> 26:31.883
Where'd you get it? You're going out to shine all 
them niggas in Old Rose Church today. Yes, ma'am,

26:37.129 --> 26:40.312
you sure is going out to shine us all. Now you shut 
your mouth, Jean. You know you're just poking fun

26:43.409 --> 26:45.652
at me? How's your ma? Where's Fanny? Oh, she 
coming. She got herself all dressed up. She say

26:52.721 --> 26:57.347
she'd whine to get happy today and beat the very 
stepping out of that gal of Susie. But I tell her, if

26:57.887 --> 27:02.774
that's the spirit she's whining to church in, she 
gotta stay at home. But she promised me that she'd

27:03.434 --> 27:08.401
behave herself and be one of the first mooners on 
the beach. And I tell her she can come on to church.

27:11.422 --> 27:18.732
This was only preliminary of what would take place 
when they all met under the big oak trees on the

27:11.422 --> 27:18.732
church ground. All the kids and kin from miles 
around would be there in their gayest mood. Soon

27:25.221 --> 27:34.793
those inside of the church would begin the song 
that would bring them in and start the worship, and

27:25.221 --> 27:34.793
the big meeting began.

27:39.300 --> 27:39.640
We'll get old

27:46.943 --> 27:54.437
Yeah.

28:05.257 --> 28:05.357
Yeah.

28:15.361 --> 28:37.403
Yee-haw-lah-yah

28:15.361 --> 28:37.403
Yee-haw-lah-yah Yee-haw-lah-yah 
Yee-haw-lah-yah

28:52.165 --> 28:53.727
Oh, yes, get on board. I got good religion.

28:59.215 --> 28:59.576
My woman. My

29:00.217 --> 29:09.169
woman. My

29:09.189 --> 29:13.576
woman. My woman.

29:19.638 --> 29:31.076
Well,

29:19.638 --> 29:31.076
well, well.

29:31.256 --> 29:35.002
Praise the Lord, I got vision in my soul. Between 3 
and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, you would see them

29:35.022 --> 29:40.431
coming on their way back home. Now the chickens in 
the barnyard had better reach high, for Brother

29:40.850 --> 29:54.343
Andy and Brother Pfeiffer had a mighty tooth for 
fried chicken when they was postulating the wood,

29:40.850 --> 29:54.343
which meant in real terms was preaching. Brother 
Andy did the preaching, and Brother Pfeiffer was

29:54.363 --> 30:01.609
the said brother and amen man. In the most tense 
moment, when the morning's bench was still full,

30:07.917 --> 30:13.149
The moonest and the mightiest calls were being 
made for them to come through. Old rough father

30:14.231 --> 30:23.291
would go to the door and plead for the Lord to come 
his self, not to send his son. We got no time to fool

30:23.893 --> 30:27.681
with chillin' here tonight. Come right through 
the cornfield. Don't take time to come all the way

30:30.674 --> 30:35.445
around the road by Mr. John Coleman. Cause these 
mooners are just about ready to come through. Then

30:39.836 --> 30:42.262
the others will join in the prayer by singing. 
Let's go.
