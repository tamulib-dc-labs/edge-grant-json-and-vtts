WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:30.055
okay

00:01.482 --> 00:30.055
my name is roger galatis and i'm president of the 
woodlands corporation i've been with the

00:01.482 --> 00:30.055
woodlands corporation now since february 1979 
and had an opportunity to participate in the

00:01.482 --> 00:30.055
growth of the woodlands during that period of time 
and also Prior to 1979, I lived in the local area,

00:30.659 --> 00:54.287
worked for a competing real estate development 
company whose name is Friendswood Development

00:30.659 --> 00:54.287
Company, a subsidiary of Exxon, and had an 
opportunity to watch the weapons grow from its

00:30.659 --> 00:54.287
beginning and monitored and participated in that 
growth through its 16-year history. history to

00:54.740 --> 00:56.783
this point. The Woodlands is 16 years old October 
19th. Everything you see here today and what you

01:01.048 --> 01:07.375
will encounter has occurred in 16 years.

01:10.940 --> 01:11.320
Remarkable. Now, in Friendswood, in terms of what 
Friendswood was doing as compared to what

01:11.380 --> 01:24.156
Woodlands... Well, Friendswood and all the 
company is wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon

01:11.380 --> 01:24.156
Corporation. And they have developed 
large-scale communities in Houston, Clear Lake

01:24.693 --> 01:32.883
City, which is where the NASA Space Center is 
located. And actually, it was the first

01:33.424 --> 01:38.510
large-scale plane community to be developed in 
the Houston region. That started in the late 50s,

01:38.530 --> 01:45.379
actually, and active development work in the 
early and mid-60s. The second large community

01:46.079 --> 01:51.426
that Princewood developed was a joint venture 
with King Ranch. And it's called Kingwood, which

01:52.030 --> 01:58.680
is located 25 miles to the east of the Woodlands. 
Both of those very large scale, similar in nature

01:58.700 --> 02:09.957
to the Woodlands in terms of scope and size and life 
expectancy and those kinds of things. So I had some

02:09.977 --> 02:21.514
reference to judge what was happening in the 
Woodlands in the early days and to make the move to

02:09.977 --> 02:21.514
the Woodlands when I first came in contact with 
George Mitchell. And then when and how was that?

02:27.142 --> 02:39.517
Well, I was happily working for Friendswood, and I 
got a call one day from an executive search firm,

02:27.142 --> 02:39.517
and the question was, would you like to join the 
Woodlands development? And my first answer was,

02:39.537 --> 02:42.100
no, I'm happy where I am. Well, that conversation 
went on for a while. The short story is that after

02:45.845 --> 02:50.050
several conversations, I elected to to join the 
Woodlands, and that was in 1979. I've been here

02:52.729 --> 02:55.552
continuously since that time. Have you contacted 
George Mitchell, had conversations with him

02:55.572 --> 03:01.339
before that decision, personally? I knew George 
Mitchell by reputation, not personally, and I

03:01.559 --> 03:12.871
knew the Woodlands by observation, and I knew a 
number of the people who lived and worked in the

03:01.559 --> 03:12.871
Woodlands. I had some knowledge of what was 
happening, but no personal knowledge of Mr.

03:12.891 --> 03:19.058
Mitchell and his a visionary approach and 
enthusiasm for doing things in a visionary way. So

03:27.177 --> 03:29.520
that's not what brought you into this firm? No, it 
was not that per se. I guess one of the things that

03:32.504 --> 03:47.442
was intriguing about coming to the Woodlands was 
the fact that it was in Montgomery County, the

03:32.504 --> 03:47.442
county where I established home, a place I wanted 
to remain probably for the rest of my life. It was at

03:48.029 --> 03:56.858
the stage of development where a lot of potential 
existed for the future, and I thought the timing

03:48.029 --> 03:56.858
was good to make that move. Did you move in as 
president? Yeah, president. No. Originally, I

04:00.862 --> 04:16.197
came to the Woodlands and was responsible for the 
residential part of the development here, the

04:00.862 --> 04:16.197
residential community, which includes all the 
infrastructure and support structures and

04:00.862 --> 04:16.197
support structure for the residents who live 
here, including schools and churches and that

04:16.666 --> 04:24.897
kind of infrastructure. I originally became his 
senior vice president of residential

04:24.917 --> 04:30.064
development. Later became executive vice 
president of the company, and then in 1986 became

04:30.084 --> 04:40.137
president

04:30.084 --> 04:40.137
of the company. You know George Mitchell now. Very 
well. Yeah, I would imagine so. You must have a feel

04:45.556 --> 04:52.444
for what it is he wanted

04:45.556 --> 04:52.444
you to do. As you got promoted through the company, 
you must have a sense of, I don't want to call it an

04:52.845 --> 05:06.962
agenda, but he obviously had certain things that 
he had you in mind to do. Well, George is a person who

05:07.883 --> 05:14.331
has a great vision for the future. And sometimes it 
takes lesser men a longer period of time to

05:14.767 --> 05:26.118
understand what that vision is. But George's 
enthusiasm never wanes. George never loses a

05:28.961 --> 05:32.504
battle. Maybe he's not yet won it, but he's never 
lost it. And the former chancellor at Texas A&M,

05:43.218 --> 05:51.066
I'm not sure if that's the right word. I'm not sure 
if that's the right word. I'm not sure if that's the

05:55.330 --> 05:57.712
right word. I'm not sure if that's the right word. 
I'm not sure if that's the right word. today are

06:12.732 --> 06:14.274
already solved. They may not like the solution, 
but nonetheless, they're solved. And he's

06:18.078 --> 06:20.761
thinking about 30 years down the road. And that 
describes Georgia about as well as any attempt to

06:21.522 --> 06:26.648
describe Georgia I've heard. And it's impressed 
me since I've heard Frank make that statement.

06:34.437 --> 06:40.123
I made a talk one time, and I said working for George 
Mitchell is fairly simple. What you need to do is do

06:41.437 --> 06:50.129
it with integrity, do it with quality, make sure 
you save the trees and natural vegetation, and do

06:41.437 --> 06:50.129
it right now. If you do those things, you're in 
pretty good shape with George. I think that's a

06:54.675 --> 06:57.820
consistent formula. I would guess you... George 
is not inconsistent. George is very consistent in

07:01.485 --> 07:04.609
his approach. One of the things George does and 
insists that this company do, and I think it's a

07:05.905 --> 07:19.198
tribute to him that's comfortable for us, is we put 
a lot back into this community. We expect to make a

07:19.218 --> 07:21.019
profit. We're in the business to make a profit. But 
there are many things that we do as a development

07:23.221 --> 07:34.512
company that puts value back into the community 
that has long-lasting effects and will have

07:23.221 --> 07:34.512
long-lasting effects on this community for years 
and years to come. but maybe a typical developer in

07:34.998 --> 07:38.723
other places might not do. For example, there's a 
program of art in public places, and as you drive

07:38.743 --> 07:52.661
through the community, you will see major works of 
art that's been installed in public esplanades or

07:38.743 --> 07:52.661
in your building. I think we have about 13 pieces of 
major artwork now that have been funded both by the

07:52.681 --> 08:03.194
development company and by other companies who 
bought land from us and built buildings. We set

08:03.314 --> 08:04.836
aside a portion of our land sales revenue and a 
portion of the cost of constructing the building

08:05.170 --> 08:12.577
into an art fund. And that fund is used to not only 
acquire art pieces, but also to maintain those

08:12.597 --> 08:21.165
that have been acquired over time. We also just 
finished building and developing the Cynthia

08:21.185 --> 08:34.198
Woods Natural Center for Performing Arts in the 
Woodlands, which is about a $10 million

08:21.185 --> 08:34.198
contribution that obviously is going to add value 
to the community. add value to the remaining lands

08:34.803 --> 08:38.587
we have to develop and sell. But it's something 
that didn't have to be done. It's something George

08:43.211 --> 08:44.633
wanted to do. He felt very strongly that it needs to 
be a regional asset for the city of Houston as well

08:45.353 --> 08:53.982
as the woodlands in Montgomery County. And this 
past year we had probably, in its first year of

08:54.002 --> 09:02.650
operations, 30 different performances there 
that include the ballet, the symphony,

09:03.322 --> 09:22.246
contemporary music, country music, a whole array 
of programs, and more than 200,000 people came to

09:03.322 --> 09:22.246
attend those 20 to 30 performances,

09:03.322 --> 09:22.246
an average of 6,000 people for each performance. 
What was your vision for the women when you joined

09:22.866 --> 09:28.894
this company? Did you see it as something really 
different from what you've been doing? Well, the

09:31.958 --> 09:41.852
Woodlands is probably more comprehensive than 
most other large-scale communities in the

09:31.958 --> 09:41.852
Houston region and is as comprehensive as any in 
the country. There are only five, six, maybe 10

09:41.872 --> 09:53.108
places in the country where a community like this 
is being developed in a comprehensive nature. So

09:53.789 --> 09:58.435
it's a unique employment opportunity. It gives 
you national exposure. international

10:01.085 --> 10:26.147
recognition not not just as an individual but the 
community and the quality of what's being done

10:01.085 --> 10:26.147
here is recognized as being quality one thing i see 
during here in the traditional review community

10:01.085 --> 10:26.147
concept is in fact this idea of the economic 
community yeah and i sense that maybe this is one of

10:01.085 --> 10:26.147
your special for us well explain how that's being 
developed early on we we We recognized clearly we

10:26.347 --> 10:40.271
were not just in the real estate development 
business, but we had to be in the economic

10:26.347 --> 10:40.271
development business if we were to succeed,

10:26.347 --> 10:40.271
which is different from some other large-scale 
communities. We started out, in fact, with a large

10:40.291 --> 10:46.081
residential component, a recreational 
component. But simultaneously with that, we set

10:50.798 --> 10:54.423
about the mission of developing jobs in the local 
community. When did that come along? Was that

10:55.284 --> 10:57.748
already part of the program when you came in? Yeah, 
it was in the fledgling stage. We've expanded it

11:00.291 --> 11:03.475
over the 12 years I've been here. But that was part 
of the mission. Our goal and objective is to create

11:08.222 --> 11:14.611
jobs along with housing and residential 
population. Right now we have close to 8,000

11:14.631 --> 11:18.196
permanent jobs in the Woodlands. The original 
objective was to have one job for every household

11:20.397 --> 11:23.561
in the Woodlands. Today we have about 11,500 
households and 8,000 jobs. But we also have about

11:29.088 --> 11:32.312
2,000 retirement units in the Woodlands. So if you 
take those out of the workforce, we're pretty

11:32.332 --> 11:37.980
close to imbalance. And I think the very 
impressive thing about that is we've been able to

11:38.000 --> 11:48.193
create those jobs during a period of time when 
Houston lost 200,000 jobs in its economy. Let's

11:48.308 --> 11:50.211
talk about the 1980s now. Okay, the 1980s. You're 
here in 1979, you're here, and the economy is just

11:51.092 --> 12:07.796
about to go into a... Well, starting in 1980, late 
in 79, through 1982, the Houston economy, the

11:51.092 --> 12:07.796
Texas economy, was very robust.

12:10.419 --> 12:14.485
Frankly, I guess we went through a period of 
arrogance in Texas, and developed a reputation

12:14.802 --> 12:19.708
which was deserved but not very pleasing in other 
parts of the country. The price of oil was

12:21.770 --> 12:24.974
escalating and energy was keying. Jobs were being 
created in the Houston economy at the rate of

12:27.217 --> 12:33.384
65,000, 70,000 jobs a year. The population was 
growing at 90,000 a year. Tremendous need for

12:37.949 --> 12:43.476
housing, tremendous need for office buildings, 
tremendous need for shopping and support

12:37.949 --> 12:43.476
services. And frankly, a lot of things could be 
built without much thought given the quality of

12:44.300 --> 12:51.971
life and those kinds of things. And then in 1982, 
when the first decline in oil prices became

12:51.991 --> 13:04.710
apparent, some of that robust nature of the 
economy started drifting away. And by 1986,

13:05.812 --> 13:11.320
things were really pretty bad in the Houston 
economy as well as throughout the state of Texas.

13:12.278 --> 13:39.677
And it became quite apparent that if we were going 
to compete on a national scale and attract

13:12.278 --> 13:39.677
businesses into the Houston region and diversify 
our economy and get away from being 80% dependent

13:12.278 --> 13:39.677
on energy and try to bring in companies like Compaq 
Computer and biotechnology firms and things that

13:12.278 --> 13:39.677
would give us a broader economic base, we were 
going to have to pay attention as a city, as a

13:12.278 --> 13:39.677
region. We were going to have to pay attention to 
the quality of life issues. And that really played

13:42.805 --> 13:50.154
into the hands of the Woodlands very nicely, 
because from the outset, we were, our mission was

13:42.805 --> 13:50.154
to deal with quality of life. And back in 1982, we 
sold in the Woodlands, if I recall, as one measure

13:50.695 --> 14:00.908
of activity, I think we sold 1000 new homes that 
year. But we only had 2.8% of the housing market in

14:02.009 --> 14:08.257
Houston. In the downturn in 1987-88,

14:12.961 --> 14:14.242
which was about the bottom of it. We were selling 
maybe 500 homes in Houston, but we had captured

14:14.843 --> 14:22.631
maybe 10% or 11% of the total market. So while 
absolute numbers had declined, our market share

14:22.651 --> 14:28.136
had grown tremendously. And today, the five 
large-scale communities in Houston capture

14:28.156 --> 14:41.770
about 40% of the housing market in Houston, which 
says that in five locations, almost one out of

14:28.156 --> 14:41.770
every two new home sales made in Houston in those 
five locations and those five locations while

14:42.155 --> 15:10.086
they differ in scope and size and somewhat in 
approach they do address quality of life issues

14:42.155 --> 15:10.086
and i think the lack of zoning in houston and the 
ability of these large-scale communities to

14:42.155 --> 15:10.086
through restrictive covenants in in effect 
establishes the zoning so that people would know

14:42.155 --> 15:10.086
where the shopping centers are going to be and the 
apartments are going to be and the single-family

14:42.155 --> 15:10.086
housing are going to be coupled with the mission of 
creating jobs in the local community and

15:10.758 --> 15:30.797
enhancing the mobility to get from this location 
to other job locations for those who did not work

15:10.758 --> 15:30.797
here, greatly enhanced the position of the 
woodlands and the other large-scale communities

15:10.758 --> 15:30.797
in the Houston region. Let me interrupt for a 
second and ask a question. You mentioned that in

15:35.102 --> 15:38.605
the downturn, I don't want to put words in your 
mouth, but what I'm hearing you say is that the

15:39.563 --> 15:51.518
Woodlands was appropriately positioned to take 
advantage of quality of life issues. The quality

15:52.259 --> 15:54.682
of life issue has been something from the 
inception. That's right. We've heard. Right. Did

15:56.384 --> 15:59.488
you, at the same time, though, I mean, was this a 
passive thing? Did you just reap a benefit, or in

15:59.528 --> 16:08.980
fact, was there some sort of marketing effort, 
aggressive or low-key, to go out and sell the

16:09.196 --> 16:12.221
concept of the Woodlands to other parts of the 
country? No. We aggressively marketed the

16:12.721 --> 16:16.447
product that we were building. And we were able to 
more clearly focus on the quality of life issues in

16:16.547 --> 16:23.317
that marketing approach. And we did things beyond 
marketing. Marketing is sort of an

16:27.243 --> 16:29.606
all-encompassing word. It includes selling. It 
includes advertising. But it also includes

16:32.931 --> 16:34.534
building a product. And I think we were building 
the product was the main thing. We have planted the

16:39.790 --> 16:55.029
seed that led toward the development of the 
hospital in the Woodlands, which provided a

16:39.790 --> 16:55.029
delivery for health services in this local 
community and in this region surrounding the

16:39.790 --> 16:55.029
Woodlands. We also followed that same model and 
have assisted in the development of a private

16:55.049 --> 17:06.523
college preparatory school here in the Woodlands 
called the John Cooper School. We donated land.

17:09.372 --> 17:12.316
guaranteed some of the financing for the first 
building to be constructed. We helped recruit the

17:12.356 --> 17:21.206
faculty and helped identify key board members to 
serve on a nonprofit corporation that owns it.

17:21.227 --> 17:23.670
Now, that does a couple of things for you. One, it 
expresses clearly your involvement in quality of

17:23.690 --> 17:34.883
life issues and your concern for education, the 
elevation of the educational standards. But in

17:34.903 --> 17:38.788
addition to that, it helps you to attract 
businesses here particularly in the high-tech

17:39.224 --> 18:07.527
area, in the biotechnology and the medical field, 
which we actively pursued through the

17:39.224 --> 18:07.527
involvement of the Texas Medical Center, because 
those people are interested in quality education

17:39.224 --> 18:07.527
for their children, and they're more likely to 
live in an environment where that educational

17:39.224 --> 18:07.527
opportunity is available, where quality housing 
is available, a broad cross-section of housing

17:39.224 --> 18:07.527
opportunities are here, and medical services are 
available. But you have gotten cooperation and

18:07.945 --> 18:14.713
support from the Texas Medical Center, not 
competition in terms of that. Well, Texas

18:14.733 --> 18:24.043
Medical, institutions in the Texas Medical 
Center is separate and apart from the Texas

18:14.733 --> 18:24.043
Medical Center, which is a nonprofit corporation 
itself. We've dealt with Baylor College of

18:24.484 --> 18:31.592
Medicine, University of Texas Health Science 
Center, now MD Anderson. And all of those have a

18:31.612 --> 18:34.695
presence here in the Woodlands. an interesting 
thing that happened in this diversification

18:35.249 --> 19:03.585
effort in texas in the houston region before the 
downturn occurred the texas medical center

18:35.249 --> 19:03.585
engaged in tremendous research programs they 
wrote about those research programs published it

18:35.249 --> 19:03.585
in the england journal of medicine and other 
companies uh pharmaceutical companies in other

18:35.249 --> 19:03.585
parts of the country and overseas Europe and Japan 
particularly, took those academic findings and

19:03.903 --> 19:16.154
converted that to a product or a process that 
created commercial growth. And George Mitchell

19:17.875 --> 19:26.062
had the notion that that could happen right here in 
Houston, Texas, and more particularly here in the

19:17.875 --> 19:26.062
Woodlands. And he formed a venture capital 
company to help medical schools fund startup

19:26.082 --> 19:32.948
companies so that they could develop and benefit 
from their academic work in a commercial field.

19:38.331 --> 19:42.238
And that benefited the Woodlands because we could 
build buildings to house that activity. The

19:43.019 --> 19:48.468
scientists would live here in the Woodlands and 
they would buy homes here. So it was, I think, a very

19:48.488 --> 19:58.986
good marriage that once again came out of the 
position of George Mitchell and his willingness

19:48.488 --> 19:58.986
to invest funds to make it happen. Did this 
basically start with a hospital and then started

19:59.067 --> 20:02.411
to expand? No, the hospital came along. The 
hospital actually was a separate initiative, not

20:04.012 --> 20:12.141
directly tied to the medical research in the 
medical center. It was tied to the clinical

20:12.161 --> 20:17.727
aspects of the medical center. And it was needed 
actually to help deliver it. In the early days,

20:22.973 --> 20:28.078
1975, 76, 77, a group of people in the Woodlands 
came together, and this is what's nice about the

20:28.548 --> 20:32.213
Woodlands. The developer doesn't have to do 
everything here. It's the quality people who come

20:34.537 --> 20:38.022
in and make this a very special place. Given the 
chance, they'll solve a lot of their own problems

20:38.823 --> 20:44.671
and give them some initiatives and 
encouragement. But a group of people came

20:45.092 --> 20:57.390
together and formed something called the 
Woodlands Medical Center, Inc. And they had this

20:45.092 --> 20:57.390
question, how do we provide medical services for a 
growing community that one day will be 150,000

20:45.092 --> 20:57.390
people? And it started out with the vision of 
having a clinic with two beds in it so that you could

20:58.045 --> 21:07.078
have outpatient services. And that notion grew 
into a 100-bed hospital before it was

21:07.098 --> 21:11.203
constructed. But this was outside the framework 
of the Women's Corporation. Well, we were deeply

21:14.728 --> 21:16.190
involved in it. We were involved in it. I spent 
eight years of my life working on it. But that was

21:20.516 --> 21:24.642
the facility that really took the initiative. We 
had a nonprofit corporation with a board of

21:24.662 --> 21:27.546
directors comprised of people who lived in this 
community and also some people who were

21:27.982 --> 21:36.530
associated with Baylor College of Medicine and 
Methodist Hospital. And through that nucleus of

21:36.550 --> 21:47.380
people and some funding on our behalf and some 
planning that we put into it, we now have a hundred

21:36.550 --> 21:47.380
bed hospital operating here. It's a non-profit 
corporation. And that same model was used to

21:49.642 --> 21:54.046
develop the private school. Okay, so that's sort 
of a style of management, isn't it? Right. Right.

21:58.238 --> 22:00.661
And that evolved, you know, you learn as you go 
along. One other significant element that has

22:01.562 --> 22:21.027
occurred here that involves Texas A&M in the 
University of Texas, University of Houston, was

22:01.562 --> 22:21.027
the formation of the, then the Houston Area 
Research Center, which modified its name to the

22:01.562 --> 22:21.027
Houston Advanced Research Center, still using 
the acronym HART. But that's modeled after the

22:21.868 --> 22:27.215
research triangle in North Carolina. When And 
North Carolina looked at itself and its economic

22:28.799 --> 22:35.890
futures. Back in the 60s, they tried to assess what 
their strengths were. And the tobacco industry

22:42.220 --> 22:46.948
was going down, agriculture was going down. But 
they had a strong involvement of academic

22:47.569 --> 22:55.161
institutions and a need for research. So they 
formed this 5,000-acre block of land called the

22:55.883 --> 23:00.006
Research Triangle. It is a triangle, actually, 
between the University of North Carolina and the

23:02.168 --> 23:08.334
North Carolina State and Duke. And they formed 
something very similar to HART, which is the

23:09.234 --> 23:15.059
Research Triangle Institute. And it was the 
nucleus that has led to the development of more

23:15.079 --> 23:20.063
than 30,000 jobs in that location now. And the 
world-renowned for its research activities and

23:20.083 --> 23:25.468
high-tech manufacturing there. facilities i 
guess ibm is the largest singular employer there

23:25.685 --> 23:54.342
what was the initiative behind the park were you 
involved in that yeah i was involved in it on the

23:25.685 --> 23:54.342
periphery george mitchell once again had the 
notion that had the bulldog determination to make

23:25.685 --> 23:54.342
it work willing to put some of his personal funds 
into it to make it work the company donated agreed

23:25.685 --> 23:54.342
to donate 100 acres of land for our campus upon 
which it would be built and provided some of the

23:54.862 --> 24:23.637
initial funding for the first several buildings 
that were built and now it once again is a

23:54.862 --> 24:23.637
freestanding non-profit corporation not under 
the control and direction anyway of the woodlands

23:54.862 --> 24:23.637
corporation but it is here in the woodland and it 
does things that benefits the community do you

23:54.862 --> 24:23.637
have a sense it sounds to me like what you're saying 
is the strategic planning occurs in the head of

23:54.862 --> 24:23.637
your commission well a lot of the initiative comes 
from that we've We try to put it into a strategic

24:24.038 --> 24:29.284
plan that can be implemented. But he's a part of a 
lot of the vision that has gone into this place. Do

24:31.987 --> 24:44.100
you have a sense or an opinion of the beauty of what 
you've described is the

24:31.987 --> 24:44.100
plan already existed. It becomes more important 
because of some economic turmoil in Texas. The

24:50.978 --> 24:56.204
notion to diversify the Houston economy, of 
course, is also going to benefit the woodlands

24:50.978 --> 24:56.204
tremendously. And these other policies that have 
developed, such as the attempt to get a portion of

24:56.925 --> 25:09.100
the University of Houston campus here, the HART, 
all these other kind of things, all feed into the

24:56.925 --> 25:09.100
same goal. I guess what I'd like to know is, or it 
would be interesting to ascertain your sense of of

25:17.870 --> 25:30.068
how you fit into that strategic planning matrix. 
You're involved also in policies. What we're

25:34.634 --> 25:42.966
trying to do is, as we interview people, identify 
what's the contribution of this individual

25:34.634 --> 25:42.966
toward for the whole that is becoming the 
woodlands. And for all time and eternity,

25:47.335 --> 25:57.666
someone's going to say, you know, Roger Galatis 
did A, B, C. Where do you fit? Well, I guess I would

25:58.487 --> 26:09.358
have to say that I'm deeply involved in the overall 
planning and development process. as it relates

26:09.929 --> 26:13.694
to the day-to-day functions that take place in 
this community. I have a deep involvement

26:13.714 --> 26:18.681
personally with people in the community. This 
community is not going to be any stronger than the

26:20.384 --> 26:24.530
fabric that holds it together. And I guess if I have 
a sense of mission myself, it's to make sure that

26:25.351 --> 26:38.670
the institutions that are put in place fit into the 
overall strategy of what's being accomplished

26:25.351 --> 26:38.670
here in the woodlands. We work closely with 
churches. We work closely with community groups.

26:43.276 --> 26:45.017
We work closely with the schools. We work closely 
with things like the Lions Club and their

26:45.758 --> 26:52.244
fundraising activities. We work closely with the 
YMCA. I was personally involved in helping bring

26:55.386 --> 27:00.911
the YMCA, a regional YMCA, into the Woodlands. I 
serve on the board of the private school and the

27:00.931 --> 27:07.577
board of the hospital, and I guess My function is to 
make sure this grand strategy is implemented in a

27:08.165 --> 27:16.015
timely and effective way. I would like to think I 
add something to that vision, but when placed

27:17.917 --> 27:29.652
against Mr. Mitchell's vision, I guess few of us 
here would reach to those great heights. I say

27:30.633 --> 27:31.434
that. But you implement. Yeah, and there are a lot 
of us implementing. I'm not sure. George's

27:37.628 --> 27:50.147
visions, I don't mind saying this on tape, and I 
don't mind you writing it down so George can hear

27:37.628 --> 27:50.147
it, but I only wish I was doing about 20% of the 
things that George Mitchell thinks I'm doing.

27:51.169 --> 27:56.497
He's a very stimulating individual, and he has 
a...

27:56.798 --> 28:01.485
He says if you're not working on five or six things 
at one time, you're not being productive. And we

28:01.505 --> 28:02.927
all have... It's a challenge to accomplish all the 
things that George would like to have

28:04.274 --> 28:14.107
accomplished in the timeframe that he thinks 
would be appropriate and suitable. But he also is a

28:15.009 --> 28:33.454
very understanding individual,

28:15.009 --> 28:33.454
and he's compassionate,

28:15.009 --> 28:33.454
sometimes not understood by everyone that comes 
in contact with him initially, because he is

28:15.009 --> 28:33.454
thinking about the future. And so many of us are 
focused on today's problem. When you see these

28:38.500 --> 28:52.683
things, such as the medical park, I guess, and the 
research park, and the Cooper School, are you

28:38.500 --> 28:52.683
essentially putting a ship out at sea to see what's 
going to happen, I guess? No, I think we have a

28:53.123 --> 28:55.788
rudder on the ship. I think we have a sense of 
direction. And sometimes when we start, though,

28:57.490 --> 29:02.378
we don't know exactly how we're going to get there. 
exactly what form it's going to take. I don't think

29:05.337 --> 29:09.903
that's necessarily a condemnation of the 
management of this place. Sometimes you just

29:10.304 --> 29:11.786
don't have all the answers. You don't know where 
you'd like to get to, what you'd like the mission to

29:11.806 --> 29:23.142
be, what you'd like to accomplish, but you're 
really not sure how you're going to get there, how

29:11.806 --> 29:23.142
it's all going to be funded. I think if you took time 
to understand all that, you may not get there. Is

29:31.298 --> 29:33.860
that, in fact, the uniqueness of the woodlands? 
You mentioned Kingwood, which is a completely

29:34.841 --> 29:38.725
different type of community. I mean, it's a nice 
community, but it's a completely different.

29:41.287 --> 29:42.328
Yeah, I worked there for a long time. Yeah, but the 
orientation of just driving through the place,

29:42.388 --> 29:46.492
it's totally different. Is the uniqueness of the 
woodlands this emphasis on infrastructure, what

29:47.053 --> 29:51.877
you're talking about? Is that really what sets it 
apart from? Well, I think there's several things

29:53.959 --> 29:55.721
it sets it apart. One, I can kind of list them in. 
This is not saying we're better or they're better,

29:58.231 --> 30:03.859
but it's an observation of differences. One, we 
work much more diligently to preserve the natural

30:04.119 --> 30:11.309
environment, natural vegetation. You drive into 
the woodlands and you don't see 30,000 people. You

30:14.514 --> 30:18.539
don't see 5,000 square feet of non-residential 
space. You don't see 12,000 homes. You don't see a

30:20.702 --> 30:22.845
conference center. And to the people who live 
here, they really like that. To some people who see

30:26.699 --> 30:32.384
it for the first time, they don't understand it, 
and it's not traditional. It's a marketing

30:32.484 --> 30:43.795
challenge, frankly, because people, when 
they're moving into the Houston region, they like

30:32.484 --> 30:43.795
things that they have seen in other places and they 
relate to them. But if we can get a shot at them and

30:43.815 --> 30:55.305
talk to them for a while and let them talk to people 
who live here, they will understand that this

30:43.815 --> 30:55.305
natural environment and natural vegetation is 
really dysfunctional. It serves to eliminate the

30:56.129 --> 31:01.718
stormwater runoff. It forms more water. When you 
urbanize a place, you're not creating flooding on

31:04.983 --> 31:09.670
your neighbors adjacent to you. It provides a 
buffer for sound, a visual buffer. It provides an

31:14.378 --> 31:17.583
environment for sustaining wildlife. Just down 
the street there's a bank building, and between

31:19.165 --> 31:22.390
here and the bank building, It's not uncommon to 
see deer crossing the road, and it's in a fairly

31:22.943 --> 31:35.878
populated area, but the wildlife still is evident 
here, and it will continue to be that. Twenty-five

31:36.319 --> 31:42.466
percent of the land is being set aside as permanent 
open space as far as the development plan.

31:42.486 --> 31:44.148
Twenty-five percent? Twenty-five percent. 
Another thing that is different here as compared

31:45.610 --> 31:52.798
to other places is when you drive in, you don't see 
the typical grocery store on the right and the

31:53.639 --> 32:04.097
service station on the left, you have to drive back 
into the community to village centers to find

31:53.639 --> 32:04.097
shopping and retail facilities. Actually, it's 
located convenient to where people live. You just

32:07.402 --> 32:11.710
don't drive past it coming in and leaving. Another 
thing that is, I think, strikingly different is

32:11.730 --> 32:15.917
the an intensive effort to create economic growth 
within the community and not be just a residential

32:16.606 --> 32:37.104
commuter community, but to give us people an 
opportunity to live and work in the same

32:16.606 --> 32:37.104
environment without the necessity to get in an 
automobile and drive as great distances as they

32:16.606 --> 32:37.104
were. I guess those are three things that I would 
say are different. And the scope of the wooded is

32:40.227 --> 32:42.809
different. The size is 25,000 acres. Sheenwood is 
14,000 acres. The Woodlands is the largest single

32:47.673 --> 32:54.759
land mass, I think, in the world.

32:54.779 --> 32:56.441
Church, you also mentioned the churches. Wasn't 
there a concerted effort by the Woodlands

32:56.461 --> 33:09.492
Corporation to, in fact, incorporate, invite, in 
fact, sustain religious and social and, again,

32:56.461 --> 33:09.492
these quality of life? Yeah. In the early days, 
there was created something called interfaith.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.819
And interfaith is not a communicable movement to 
do away with individual denominations at all. In

33:26.309 --> 33:28.491
Columbia, Maryland, that was attempted, and it 
failed. There was only one church. When you start

33:31.754 --> 33:38.740
dealing with the religious community and then 
doing away with the denominations, you're

33:31.754 --> 33:38.740
treading on thin ice. But here, the Interfaith was 
an umbrella organization that helped fledgling

33:39.220 --> 33:47.127
churches find a site in the woodlands, We helped 
them build a building which served as a place for a

33:47.849 --> 33:54.599
congregation to meet and to like afford to build a 
building. It sort of coordinated the early

33:54.619 --> 34:05.956
religious activity with each religious 
denomination keeping their own identity intact.

34:05.976 --> 34:08.299
And that organization still exists. It operates a 
daycare center. It has an outreach program for

34:09.781 --> 34:12.686
senior citizens. It does a lot of charitable 
things in addition to coordinating activities

34:12.706 --> 34:16.371
for churches. But right now, I think there are 19 
church buildings in the Woodlands that have been

34:17.093 --> 34:31.074
built, and some 23 congregations, two or three 
have not yet built their own sanctuary. See, I

34:31.094 --> 34:33.317
think that's significant. How do you make money 
off of churches? Well, you don't. You don't,

34:35.640 --> 34:36.742
that's right. But it helps develop a fabric in the 
community. That's right, that's right. And

34:41.289 --> 34:46.797
another thing we've done here, and I'm proud of 
this, I've been involved in this from the outset,

34:41.289 --> 34:46.797
we have had an ongoing program to provide housing 
for senior citizens. And it takes various forms.

34:56.483 --> 35:02.289
One, we have subsidized housing for seniors who 
cannot afford to rent apartments. So we have some

35:02.309 --> 35:07.174
600, 700 rental apartments that is subsidized. 
And that's a negative word in a lot of places,

35:07.374 --> 35:12.059
subsidized housing. And you think how 
detrimental that would be to other property

35:12.079 --> 35:15.562
sizes. But in fact, it has not been here. But senior 
citizens live in rental apartments. We have a

35:21.437 --> 35:33.474
congregate care facility with 300 units in that 
where people need some assistance in living, but

35:21.437 --> 35:33.474
not at the level of a nursing home. But we do have a 
nursing home here, too. And we have four

35:36.819 --> 35:42.026
generations of families living in the Woodlands 
today, and we're only 16 years old. And it's worked

35:42.667 --> 35:43.588
this way. First, young couple comes to buy a home 
they've been transferred here from ohio and they

35:44.168 --> 36:12.910
have a couple of young children so that's that's 
two generations there when their parents retire

35:44.168 --> 36:12.910
in ohio instead of moving to florida and not 
knowing you know in the sun city where you don't

35:44.168 --> 36:12.910
know anybody except other people who retired they 
have elected to come and live close to their

35:44.168 --> 36:12.910
children that's really happening and even the 
great-grandparents have come and their housing

35:44.168 --> 36:12.910
opportunities throughout the woodlands for 
those four generations. Not all retirees live in

36:18.673 --> 36:21.657
subsidized housing. Some choose to live by their 
own home and live independently, just as you and I

36:21.718 --> 36:28.168
would do that. But there's been this concerted 
effort to create the extended family in reverse.

36:35.499 --> 36:40.247
After World War II, families were scattered 
across the United States. grandparents stayed

36:41.088 --> 36:47.697
back at home and the kids left and they formed their 
home in another city. Kids didn't get to grow up

36:48.358 --> 36:50.160
with their grandparents. I think something 
happened to society during those years in the 50s

36:51.102 --> 36:57.971
and 60s. Here in the Woodlands, I'm pleased that 
we're part of bringing some families back

36:57.991 --> 37:02.517
together. True, it's an economic opportunity for 
us, but also it's a strengthening their family

37:09.961 --> 37:11.443
ties. Is this basically the essence of your 
demographic plan, I guess, that it's a

37:13.265 --> 37:20.153
family-oriented community? Well, it's family. 
We have a fairly good number of singles that live

37:23.937 --> 37:27.181
here. I think 40% of the families who live here have 
no children. And that's a national trend across

37:31.486 --> 37:33.548
this country. Families are waiting later to have 
children. Some have none at all. But There are also

37:40.910 --> 37:45.417
very strong family ties that exist in the 
community, too. What about an economic spectrum

37:45.437 --> 37:47.961
of society? Trying to provide something for 
everyone. Yeah, as I say, we have subsidized

37:51.787 --> 37:54.452
housing for the elderly. We have subsidized 
housing for families or individuals who don't

37:54.472 --> 38:00.241
qualify for it. I guess in total there are 1,500 
subsidized units in the woods or something like

38:00.902 --> 38:07.052
that. We have more subsidized housing in the 
Woodlands than any other community in Houston

38:07.403 --> 38:14.253
that is a planned community. Is it subsidized only 
for the elderly? No, some for families,

38:15.855 --> 38:19.560
low-income families, low- and moderate-income 
families. And that's to get a mix? Yeah. The social

38:25.509 --> 38:35.763
scheme of planning was to provide a broad 
cross-section of housing opportunities

38:25.509 --> 38:35.763
for a heterogeneous population. That's got to fit 
the new community. Yeah, well, that was part of the

38:37.643 --> 38:46.553
new community program that was conceived by the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Affairs,

38:37.643 --> 38:46.553
which failed miserably. This is the only 
community out of 13 that was formed under that

38:47.274 --> 38:59.747
Title VII new community program that came about in 
1971 that succeeded, that did not go into

38:47.274 --> 38:59.747
foreclosure. There are several that are still 
active, but it was after they went into

39:00.288 --> 39:05.794
foreclosure and they did not pay the on 
indebtedness that they were obligated to pay. But

39:10.298 --> 39:18.607
this one succeeded, and it succeeded, I think, for 
some very valid, basic reasons. One, it was

39:18.627 --> 39:21.990
adjacent to a growing metropolitan area. It was on 
a major interstate highway that led into the

39:22.591 --> 39:29.679
business district, and we were not too far removed 
from that. We were close to an international

39:29.699 --> 39:32.001
airport. There was good transportation, there 
were jobs existing in the local area, and the ones

39:32.572 --> 39:41.906
who failed didn't meet those criteria. It was a 
social experiment with the notion that if you

39:41.926 --> 39:51.660
started a new city out in an isolated part of the 
world, people would transfer from the inner city

39:52.265 --> 39:59.454
and all those problems they had would go away and 
they would start life anew and things would be

39:52.265 --> 39:59.454
wonderful and great. But it doesn't work that way. 
People who move into this community bring the

40:01.716 --> 40:05.220
problems with them that they have. I think the 
environment helps them deal with those problems,

40:06.001 --> 40:11.808
perhaps, and cope with them. But it certainly 
doesn't do away with them. By having a good school

40:15.493 --> 40:20.078
system, and we do have a good public school system, 
I mentioned private schools, And that didn't come

40:20.513 --> 40:23.656
about out of dissatisfaction with the public 
schools. It's just a supplement to the public

40:23.676 --> 40:26.299
schools. But by having a good school system, this 
growing family relationship, jobs in the local

40:26.319 --> 40:49.002
area, I think a good array of recreational 
opportunities that kids can use as well as adults,

40:26.319 --> 40:49.002
the involvement of churches in the community, and 
the establishment of traditional institutions

40:49.403 --> 40:56.429
the YMCA, the YWCA, the Kiwanis Club, the Lions 
Club, the Rotary Club. All of those kind of things

40:56.449 --> 41:02.315
have come together in a very nice way here in the 
Woodlands. Let me ask you one other question.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.320
You piqued my curiosity. I've heard four times 
now, and it's all exactly the same. One of the

41:10.342 --> 41:13.005
reasons why the Woodlands succeeded with us 
together is because it's close to a major

41:10.342 --> 41:13.005
metropolitan area. It's on the interstate. It's 
next to the airport. Did that come out of... an

41:17.922 --> 41:19.283
in-house study? Was there an independent study? 
Because everyone we've talked to says the same

41:22.226 --> 41:24.629
thing. Well, maybe we were lucky we bought the land 
in the right place. George Mitchell, once again,

41:31.916 --> 41:46.090
in an attempt to diversify his own company, which 
was predominantly oil and gas, and still is

41:31.916 --> 41:46.090
largely oil and gas, saw the growing north side of 
Houston as a as a real estate development

41:46.694 --> 42:09.664
opportunity and he started acquiring lands here 
in the early 60s through the mid-60s and there were

41:46.694 --> 42:09.664
a number of large timber companies that owned 
sizable tracts of land and taxes and other reasons

41:46.694 --> 42:09.664
made it non-productive for timber use and george 
bought a lot of land for a very reasonable price and

41:46.694 --> 42:09.664
i don't think George may disagree with it, but I 
don't think George knew exactly what he was going

42:10.167 --> 42:14.812
to do when he was buying it. He had not formulated 
all the plans, but he knew that the north side of

42:15.533 --> 42:30.269
Houston was intercontinental airport, 
interstate highway to Dallas, the wooded

42:15.533 --> 42:30.269
environment, the low cost of land at that time, the 
growth of Houston. All of those were ingredients

42:31.150 --> 42:37.997
that would lead toward a successful real estate 
development, which at that time was not I don't

42:38.213 --> 42:40.095
think totally defined. It evolved over a series of 
years of planning. Did he say that? No, that he

42:47.763 --> 42:49.345
bought the land. In fact, some of it he just bought, 
actually, thinking he couldn't lose because he

42:50.086 --> 42:58.235
could cut the timber off it and come out ahead. In 
fact, he said that. I think this thing has George's

43:01.538 --> 43:07.765
enthusiasm and vision has led the way, but He's 
attracted some good people to come help him think

43:08.437 --> 43:13.662
through the process, too, in the early days. But 
one thing that's interesting to me, it does seem

43:13.682 --> 43:19.988
that you have a style of management here that I 
haven't seen in too many places. I teach business

43:20.008 --> 43:21.730
and economic history. But what you're doing is 
creating these little autonomous divisions here

43:21.750 --> 43:29.857
that are really not controlled by you, that you're 
involved with. I'm not sure what management style

43:29.877 --> 43:32.180
that is. Decentralization and diversification 
or something like that, but it seems to work.

43:36.624 --> 43:37.785
Actually, developing... communities takes a 
management style which you probably don't find in

43:37.985 --> 43:43.951
other places. You're involved in this thing 24 
hours a day, seven days a week, and you're involved

43:44.011 --> 43:50.897
with people who are your neighbors, and that's 
another point I want to make. I think one thing

43:51.558 --> 43:58.405
that's made us successful in dealing with the 
community is we're not absentee developers. Most

43:58.425 --> 44:06.152
of our employees live right here in the woodland, 
and we see our neighbors, and we see them in the

43:58.425 --> 44:06.152
grocery store, and we see them at functions, and So 
when a problem develops, they're dealing with

44:06.622 --> 44:11.507
somebody they know. And it's on a different level 
than if it's a big developer in another city that is

44:11.527 --> 44:21.017
controlling this place and controlling my life. 
Now, that's not to say that there are not some

44:21.037 --> 44:25.241
problems that develop in caves in our community. 
There are things that some people in the community

44:26.403 --> 44:36.493
want that we can't provide, can't provide in the 
way that they perceive to be timely. There are some

44:36.929 --> 44:40.714
people that even say they've been deceived and 
misled. I would debate that with them, but

44:41.756 --> 44:46.082
nonetheless, if they feel that way, they feel that 
way. But that's a very small minority of people.

44:49.407 --> 44:54.274
And I'm pleased at the good relationship we have in 
this community. I live here, have a phone number

44:54.374 --> 45:01.404
and a telephone book, and don't feel 
uncomfortable at all in going wherever I go. And

45:02.325 --> 45:03.747
really am not... not uh put in any awkward 
positions uh because they're the corporations

45:04.790 --> 45:32.974
yeah right and i think uh other people who live here 
and work here have that same same experience since

45:04.790 --> 45:32.974
being president of the company in 1986 what would 
have been your primary preoccupation well you

45:04.790 --> 45:32.974
know in 1986 the economy of houston was at its 
lowest ever in at least in my memory. So the

45:36.015 --> 45:45.087
challenge of continuing to develop and maintain 
this community at a profitable level was

45:36.015 --> 45:45.087
certainly a challenge. We had to trim our 
workforce. We had to cut back our capital budgets.

45:49.513 --> 45:55.982
We had to do things that other companies did, and 
frankly, some of that was not very pleasant on a

45:49.513 --> 45:55.982
personal level. But we did it, and we survived. 
What about your relationship with the builders,

45:59.146 --> 46:01.168
for example? Oh, they're good. Periodic. They're 
very good. Builders like building in the

46:03.872 --> 46:07.055
woodlands. We have about 20 home builders that 
purchase lots from us and build homes. We help some

46:11.701 --> 46:14.304
of them market their homes and some sell their own. 
But they like working in an environment like the

46:15.005 --> 46:25.477
woodlands because we're not incorporated, so we 
don't have an inspection system imposed upon us by

46:15.005 --> 46:25.477
a city. But we have established architectural 
controls, building standards, and put in effect

46:31.190 --> 46:38.845
an inspection program of our own so that every 
builder has to meet certain quality standards.

46:38.865 --> 46:42.191
And they like that because no one takes advantage 
of the system. They're all on a level playing

46:42.211 --> 46:44.615
field. And so they can build to those quality 
standards and know that somebody else is not

46:44.636 --> 46:53.873
undercutting their marketing by building a 
second quality second tier quality of housing.

46:56.561 --> 46:59.845
Does the Woodlands Corporation have its own 
building inspectors? Yes, we do. We employ those.

47:03.450 --> 47:04.692
We have building inspectors. We have one person 
who does nothing but inspect the clearing of

47:04.712 --> 47:15.106
building sites to make sure that they're not 
over-cleared during the construction process.

47:15.166 --> 47:20.653
You can look at the buildings here, and you see it's 
only cleared five or ten feet away from the

47:15.166 --> 47:20.653
construction of that building. And that's not by 
accident. You really have to work at that. The

47:25.302 --> 47:32.785
temptation or tendency of builders, let's get all 
the trees out of the way so we can build a house.

47:32.805 --> 47:34.390
Maybe we'll plant some trees after we get there.
