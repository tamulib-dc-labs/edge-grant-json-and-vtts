WEBVTT

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.887
Tuesday, June the 19th, I believe, testing 1, 2, 3.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:07.210
All right.

00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:12.280
Can you grab a gurney?

00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:14.644
This is June the 19th.

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:23.642
We're in the library, and I have the honor and pleasure of chatting with Joe Berg, one of the now-retired key members of the library staff.

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:36.099
To introduce yourself to the listener to this tape and or the reader of the transcription, give a biographical sketch of yourself before you got here as a professional.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.761
Where did you grow up?

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:37.843
What did mom and dad do?

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:38.965
Where did you go to school?

00:00:38.978 --> 00:00:45.706
I grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota, and I went to public schools there.

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:56.920
I had the wonderful opportunity of going to a small liberal arts college in Northfield, Minnesota by the name of Carleton, and that was one of the highlights of my life.

00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:05.070
I, Bob and I had, my husband and I had met each other in high school,

00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:27.278
and started to date but we seriously got together and he went into the army and he went into the pre-meteorology unit and his unit, pre-meteorology unit was stationed

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:38.786
at Carleton College taking all their math and physics and all of those things that have to be taken if you're going into a technical field.

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:54.042
And as things turned out, he was turned out after all of this heavy math and physics concentration, he turned out

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.755
that he was colorblind.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:59.298
And then, of course, they were starting right then.

00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:04.163
They realized that they might have had too many at a certain level.

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:07.587
So he went into the weather service.

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:18.359
And he, of course, has probably, in this venue, told you all that happened in the weather service.

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:19.901
And that's a whole lot.

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:22.864
But anyway, to make a long story short, we were married.

00:02:23.502 --> 00:02:24.365
in 1946.

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:33.658
And we came out, we went out to Denver in 1951.

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.605
In fact,

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:42.033
This month, it'll be all 50 years since we were in Denver.

00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:48.242
And we got, in those last few weeks, we went back to Denver when Bob had a meeting.

00:02:48.742 --> 00:03:03.583
We got together with our sons and our grandson and celebrated this occasion at the Commander's Palace at the wonderful old hotel there that's so special.

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:06.490
Okay, well, that tells you.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:20.541
Anyway, we had three boys, and when the youngest was in fifth grade, we were still in Denver, and I went to library school at the University of Denver, and that's where I got my library.

00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:21.403
What was your undergraduate?

00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:24.910
My undergraduate degree was sociology and psychology.

00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:26.674
What did you think you were going to do?

00:03:26.714 --> 00:03:28.538
What did I think I was going to do?

00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:35.713
I really didn't know what I was going to do, but I'm glad that I became a librarian, a reference librarian.

00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:37.958
What led you toward libraries?

00:03:38.073 --> 00:03:48.307
Not, I think it was, I probably, as far as being subject oriented, I'm much more people oriented than I am subject oriented.

00:03:48.947 --> 00:03:52.072
But still, you have to have a knowledge of the subject.

00:03:52.652 --> 00:03:54.375
And of course, you still do.

00:03:54.595 --> 00:03:55.156
I don't care.

00:03:55.816 --> 00:04:05.329
Whatever, if you're dealing with the public, who or whichever your publics are, you'd better be interested.

00:04:05.782 --> 00:04:11.489
in their problems and be a little considerate of them in that.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.053
This was at the University of Colorado or University of Denver?

00:04:14.173 --> 00:04:17.217
No, this is University of Denver that had a library school.

00:04:17.297 --> 00:04:21.723
As a matter of fact, it was a short distance from our house, probably about eight blocks away.

00:04:22.043 --> 00:04:23.185
Then after Denver where?

00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:33.578
Then after Denver, I worked for the first few months after I graduated from the University of Denver in 1966,

00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:38.331
I worked in the Denver Public Library in the children's division of the public library.

00:04:38.352 --> 00:04:39.634
I enjoyed that very much.

00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:59.346
And then Bob was offered the job to come here as head of the geology department, which had just, I think, I can't remember how this went, but geosciences became separate with geology, geography, geophysics, all as part of, it had been,

00:04:59.478 --> 00:05:02.442
previously a part of the engineering department.

00:05:02.663 --> 00:05:14.781
So this was a very, this was a great change for that whole part of the university to have this extra college added.

00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:19.368
In today's world, he would have negotiated a position for his wife.

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.355
Was your desire for a job even mentioned in his

00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:25.536
No, I'm sure not.

00:05:25.897 --> 00:05:27.158
That's right, I'm sure not.

00:05:27.418 --> 00:05:36.668
And the point was that they were so hard up for librarians, they would have taken anybody off the street at that point, I believe.

00:05:36.728 --> 00:05:38.910
They were really very hard up for.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.835
Describe your move from, was it Denver to here?

00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:48.260
Denver, I thought I was not a crashing good sport.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.203
I thought I was moving to the end of the world.

00:05:51.942 --> 00:05:59.033
And little did I know, 50, you know, all these many years later, 35 years later, that we are staying here.

00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:00.676
This is just amazing.

00:06:00.696 --> 00:06:02.358
If anybody had told me then.

00:06:02.458 --> 00:06:02.859
Same here.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:13.676
If anybody had told me then that I would be living in Bryan College Station, Texas, I would have just, you know, probably run screaming out of the room.

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:17.562
Describe your first impressions when you first visited here.

00:06:17.761 --> 00:06:22.027
It was pleasant because it was January.

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:27.155
And there were even some, I think there was something blooming.

00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:30.039
I can't remember what it was, but something was blooming.

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:32.543
And I thought we'd just come out of a blizzard.

00:06:32.663 --> 00:06:36.108
So I thought, my goodness, this is going to be very nice.

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:38.732
Little did I know what was coming.

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:42.317
But we rented the first year we were here.

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:48.656
And then we bought a house where we still live over on East Brookside in Bryan.

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:51.519
So you bought that house what year?

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.022
We bought that house in 1968.

00:06:56.005 --> 00:06:59.529
And we have subsequently done a lot to it.

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:02.292
And we love it, love the old house.

00:07:02.312 --> 00:07:06.297
And it just kind of fits old college professor types.

00:07:06.277 --> 00:07:09.681
You know, cluttery bookish, that kind of thing.

00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:13.987
So, all right, you arrived in January, and about how long was it before you started working?

00:07:14.007 --> 00:07:17.712
I didn't start work until the next summer.

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:20.675
I started July 1st of 67.

00:07:21.156 --> 00:07:22.598
How did you learn about a vacancy?

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:34.393
I think it was Dr. Dyke who was at the time the director of the library, and he,

00:07:35.993 --> 00:07:42.772
I don't know where I heard about the job being open, but I did hear that there was a job open.

00:07:42.893 --> 00:07:48.248
I also interviewed someone in Bryan.

00:07:49.342 --> 00:08:01.945
It might have been Rebecca Landman at some point in time, but I knew that the university sounded infinitely better at that point than the public library scene.

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:09.780
But having said that, I am now on the board of the public library system.

00:08:10.672 --> 00:08:18.001
College Station and Bryan for some time and have really enjoyed it and here again seeing such a change.

00:08:19.203 --> 00:08:24.329
Describe the interview, the search process that led to your employment.

00:08:24.349 --> 00:08:29.656
It practically, that practically wasn't when I was hired.

00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:31.178
They were just so anxious

00:08:31.597 --> 00:08:34.581
to get people in here to work.

00:08:34.621 --> 00:08:37.025
They needed it so badly.

00:08:37.045 --> 00:08:39.728
You talked to... Dr. Dyke and I talked to... What was his first name?

00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:40.570
James Dyke.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:40.990
Yeah, James Dyke.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.172
I think it was James Dyke.

00:08:42.993 --> 00:08:45.757
And then I talked, of course, to LaBelle Castle.

00:08:46.939 --> 00:08:49.342
But I don't think I talked to her very long.

00:08:49.402 --> 00:08:55.731
And she was, you know, in our generation would call her an old-timey librarian.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.728
You know, she was a stickler for everything.

00:09:00.489 --> 00:09:03.035
She knew where everything was at that point in time.

00:09:04.818 --> 00:09:09.609
But you did what you were supposed to do, and that was fine.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:13.517
And she wasn't going to question anything you did as long as you were going to do your job.

00:09:13.852 --> 00:09:17.056
And describe the job you were offered.

00:09:17.076 --> 00:09:24.146
The job I was offered was just a reference librarian because, of course, it was all general reference.

00:09:24.226 --> 00:09:35.802
And that's what general reference meant was whatever reference material they could get on the second floor of Cushing is what that meant.

00:09:35.822 --> 00:09:40.428
And you were probably there then, too, so you know what was there.

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:41.790
This is the only dollar question.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.032
What was the beginning pay?

00:09:43.754 --> 00:09:45.620
You know, I have no idea.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.883
I can't.

00:09:47.244 --> 00:09:48.408
I'm telling you the truth.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:49.752
I don't remember that.

00:09:50.073 --> 00:09:52.299
A lot of people would remember that first thing.

00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:57.595
In fact, I was rereading Bob's memoirs the other day,

00:09:58.013 --> 00:10:04.360
And he remembered what the California company offered him in Denver those many years ago.

00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:06.943
But I don't remember, I don't remember.

00:10:07.184 --> 00:10:11.148
Did they describe for you your responsibilities?

00:10:11.469 --> 00:10:15.313
Not like it came to be, my goodness, no.

00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:23.563
There was very little, you know, we just sort of did this, did that, just kept things going.

00:10:23.703 --> 00:10:25.405
And what were your normal working hours?

00:10:25.587 --> 00:10:36.303
My normal working hours were just about 8 to 5 and we all had to, up until the time I retired, all of us had to work a night and a weekend.

00:10:36.864 --> 00:10:38.085
In addition to the day?

00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:41.270
In addition, yeah, in addition to our day.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:49.322
Usually on the day that we worked a night we would leave at noon or come in at noon depending on how you wanted to do it and work it that way.

00:10:49.462 --> 00:10:50.143
I would always

00:10:50.714 --> 00:11:14.646
work until noon and then and then take the afternoon off and and then go back from six to ten describe the make believe i didn't know anything about the texas a m library in the mid this is 67. this is this is going to be 67. describe the texas a m library in 1967. it was it was uh well considering

00:11:14.845 --> 00:11:28.800
considering the isolation of what was A&M and considering the curriculum that was heavily weighted, of course, and you know this as well as I do, heavily weighted on the science, technology, and agriculture.

00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:34.106
And very little went into the liberal arts.

00:11:36.068 --> 00:11:43.536
Because of you and some of your colleagues, you got started with this, but it certainly wasn't going to be evident

00:11:44.191 --> 00:12:00.750
And building, you know, I don't think that those early people realized, had any idea how much the university was going to grow, how much you had to build your library collections to support this.

00:12:01.131 --> 00:12:03.834
I don't think anybody had any idea.

00:12:03.914 --> 00:12:09.240
Maybe I didn't even realize how much it was going to have to change, things would have to change.

00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:11.683
Now it was the Cushing Building

00:12:12.153 --> 00:12:20.745
And they were just finishing the, they were just completing the Evans Library, the first edition, which is this building.

00:12:20.825 --> 00:12:21.666
To include.

00:12:21.786 --> 00:12:22.828
To include.

00:12:22.968 --> 00:12:23.949
To build around the Gilchrist.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.213
To build around, right, to build around that.

00:12:27.334 --> 00:12:36.507
We were going to have, we were going to have divisional reference, the science and technology was going to be on the fourth floor,

00:12:37.212 --> 00:12:40.115
We were down on the third floor.

00:12:41.437 --> 00:12:44.460
Social sciences and liberal arts were on the third floor.

00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:48.865
Documents was on the second floor, which was on the second floor.

00:12:48.905 --> 00:12:50.167
That lasted a long time.

00:12:50.287 --> 00:12:59.878
But eventually we consolidated, and we were always reorganizing.

00:13:00.213 --> 00:13:02.517
I was talking to my compadres over here.

00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:05.201
My goodness gracious, it never stops.

00:13:05.362 --> 00:13:10.831
They're still in this, going through all of this change.

00:13:10.851 --> 00:13:16.180
But of course, the biggest change has come probably in the last 10 years with all of the

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.805
That new addition, when did it, when was it finished?

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:28.294
The new, the Evans Library I think was finished maybe in the fall of 68.

00:13:28.514 --> 00:13:36.043
I mean it was in the process when I moved here, when I took a job here in 67.

00:13:36.344 --> 00:13:43.652
Do you remember any stories about the complications that the librarians endured while the construction was underway?

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:50.450
Not from any serious standpoint, because we didn't have to worry about too big a collection.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:57.300
I mean, that engineering was already sort of established.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.928
But I don't remember any real stories about inconvenience.

00:14:03.088 --> 00:14:05.472
And of course, I might not have anyway.

00:14:05.452 --> 00:14:08.835
But that was just one of those things.

00:14:08.955 --> 00:14:11.958
Now, your responsibilities were broad.

00:14:12.579 --> 00:14:14.601
Were broad, were very broad.

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:17.884
That included education, too.

00:14:17.904 --> 00:14:21.367
You know, we had the College of Education.

00:14:21.407 --> 00:14:24.410
We had all of their teacher textbooks.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.792
We had all of their curriculum collections.

00:14:27.953 --> 00:14:29.755
This included a lot of material.

00:14:30.956 --> 00:14:35.340
And subsequently, we just did not have room for these materials.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:42.761
And that was when the big push was to go to put everything as yet you possibly could on microfilm.

00:14:42.801 --> 00:14:48.710
Well, we read in the New York Times about the dangers of that.

00:14:50.493 --> 00:14:53.258
But you can't keep this much material.

00:14:53.438 --> 00:14:55.040
You cannot keep it.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:15:02.152
Logistically, there is not going to be room to keep the New York Times forever and ever.

00:15:02.292 --> 00:15:02.813
Amen.

00:15:03.451 --> 00:15:17.697
So this gentleman that has made a big splash in the press, he may have a little serious problem at some point in time when his heirs have to shovel him out, to be perfectly blunt.

00:15:18.301 --> 00:15:28.356
Did anybody, when you began as a new member of the professional staff, did anybody give you any guidelines, any assignments, any rules?

00:15:29.117 --> 00:15:29.738
Not really.

00:15:30.219 --> 00:15:34.305
No, you were just expected to be a nice person and do your job and that was it.

00:15:34.925 --> 00:15:39.432
And how did a professional lady in the library staff dress in those days?

00:15:39.496 --> 00:15:47.443
Well, you didn't, it was just at the time when people were starting to wear pantsuits, but most of us just wore skirts.

00:15:47.984 --> 00:15:52.568
And we didn't try to dress up, but we did wear skirts and sweater.

00:15:52.868 --> 00:16:01.096
Well, actually, I don't think, I always had a sweater in this library because sometimes it would get very cold in the air conditioning.

00:16:02.477 --> 00:16:03.919
And that never changed.

00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:08.743
The, in those early years,

00:16:09.095 --> 00:16:14.746
Where did you and your colleagues, if you wanted to have a refreshment, where did you?

00:16:15.147 --> 00:16:18.713
Well, I think in those years, we had a staff.

00:16:18.974 --> 00:16:20.677
There was a staff lounge.

00:16:20.737 --> 00:16:21.759
I don't know if it's still here.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.787
In the early days of Evans, there was a staff lounge around the

00:16:26.223 --> 00:16:29.329
around that way, it seems to me, I'm thinking of it.

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:47.725
And so we could always go in the staff lounge, and they had, of course, with anything like that, students were frequently getting themselves in there, and so they had to put locks on it, and the locks would always not work, or somebody would pick them, you know, just the same old stuff.

00:16:47.705 --> 00:16:51.391
Describe the senior leadership in the library then.

00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:53.114
Who were they?

00:16:53.174 --> 00:17:00.085
The senior, after LaVelle, let's see, after Dr. Dyke left, Jack Smith came.

00:17:00.947 --> 00:17:03.331
And he was, Jack Smith, Describe him.

00:17:04.172 --> 00:17:08.139
He was simply, he was wonderful.

00:17:08.439 --> 00:17:13.527
I couldn't believe that anybody could be so caring about the staff.

00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:15.130
You know, you didn't expect that.

00:17:16.612 --> 00:17:20.416
And as we found out later, it wasn't going to last very long.

00:17:20.997 --> 00:17:28.885
But anyway, he was a very caring person and everybody liked him.

00:17:29.166 --> 00:17:31.408
Everybody really, really liked Jack.

00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:35.252
We were all just crushed when he left here.

00:17:35.653 --> 00:17:36.493
He went to Stony Brook.

00:17:36.513 --> 00:17:43.801
And he went to Stony Brook and subsequently did get his Ph.D.

00:17:44.222 --> 00:17:46.264
But from my

00:17:47.695 --> 00:18:04.034
from hearsay or something that he didn't he did not get the permanent position here because he did not have his doctorate but I don't know that to be true this is just what I hearsay so that is not probably anything.

00:18:04.155 --> 00:18:06.017
And then who was next?

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:10.762
Well our former director was Irene Hoadley.

00:18:10.903 --> 00:18:12.184
Did she fall in Jack?

00:18:12.417 --> 00:18:14.039
And she followed Jack.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.741
Right.

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.122
We'll talk about her in a minute.

00:18:18.203 --> 00:18:22.368
Who were, were there associate or assistant directors?

00:18:22.388 --> 00:18:23.209
Yes.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.273
Henry Alsmeyer was an assistant.

00:18:27.794 --> 00:18:28.594
Describe him.

00:18:29.015 --> 00:18:38.425
Henry Alsmeyer was a very, I would, he was well-meaning.

00:18:38.962 --> 00:18:44.571
So I don't mean to be critical, but he was very stuffy.

00:18:45.913 --> 00:18:53.406
And he had a tendency to treat us like we were parishioners instead of staff.

00:18:53.987 --> 00:18:57.232
We always thought that we were in Bible school or something.

00:18:57.953 --> 00:18:59.075
But that's not fair.

00:18:59.255 --> 00:19:03.282
That isn't fair, because I realize

00:19:04.358 --> 00:19:06.361
He was brought up in a very strict family.

00:19:06.441 --> 00:19:09.204
He was, you know, he was his own person.

00:19:13.509 --> 00:19:18.336
What was your first impression of Texas A&M students?

00:19:18.356 --> 00:19:25.084
Well, of course, there were so many male students at that point.

00:19:26.195 --> 00:19:30.223
I've always loved being on a college campus.

00:19:30.844 --> 00:19:31.646
I really have.

00:19:31.746 --> 00:19:35.273
I really enjoy that part of it.

00:19:35.313 --> 00:19:38.239
That's what I really miss, as a matter of fact, being retired.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.524
I miss seeing the students.

00:19:40.564 --> 00:19:47.578
Now, I don't miss them on the highways particularly, but I do miss the atmosphere.

00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:51.542
I always have enjoyed mingling with them.

00:19:51.882 --> 00:19:56.591
But now, you as a newcomer to Texas, you didn't know about Aggies.

00:19:56.851 --> 00:19:57.973
I didn't know about Texas Aggies.

00:19:57.993 --> 00:19:59.436
What were your first impressions of Aggies?

00:19:59.456 --> 00:20:02.101
My first impression of Texas Aggies?

00:20:03.183 --> 00:20:08.913
Well, that they were a very disciplined group, and they always said, ma'am, and they were so polite.

00:20:09.173 --> 00:20:11.237
I couldn't believe how polite these

00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:19.583
Then even during the hippie days, you wouldn't see a hippie around here, that's for sure.

00:20:19.603 --> 00:20:22.928
But anyway, they were unusually polite.

00:20:23.829 --> 00:20:27.495
And some of them were plainly scared to ask for help.

00:20:27.675 --> 00:20:28.897
They came off the farm.

00:20:29.397 --> 00:20:30.900
They were scared kids.

00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:40.414
And having had boys of my own, I could kind of sense when somebody was having a little problem

00:20:41.339 --> 00:20:45.384
being able to articulate what they really wanted.

00:20:46.325 --> 00:20:55.856
Describe some of, there must have been some amusing and sometimes very serious requests that a student made of a new reference librarian.

00:20:56.436 --> 00:21:04.466
I don't even know if it were that sophisticated at that particular point.

00:21:04.546 --> 00:21:10.873
I never had any question that I didn't feel that I couldn't answer or couldn't get one of the other librarians to answer.

00:21:10.904 --> 00:21:14.551
But didn't they sometimes ask for something unusually simple?

00:21:15.553 --> 00:21:27.737
Well, of course, we always made the joke when they would first come, they'd always want to know where the restrooms were, but that isn't exactly a difficult question to answer.

00:21:28.638 --> 00:21:29.520
Anyway.

00:21:29.838 --> 00:21:39.317
Now, in the olden days, under Tommy Mayo, before you got here, the library was the place of escape from core harassment.

00:21:39.658 --> 00:21:40.780
Oh, I didn't realize that.

00:21:41.361 --> 00:21:43.165
Did you see, you didn't see?

00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:46.632
I didn't see any core harassment.

00:21:46.612 --> 00:21:49.577
No, no, this is a place you could get away from.

00:21:49.637 --> 00:21:51.039
Go get away from, okay.

00:21:51.801 --> 00:21:54.465
Well, I suppose that's true.

00:21:55.006 --> 00:21:55.888
But it really wasn't.

00:21:55.968 --> 00:22:03.220
If the whole Corps was trying to get away from harassment, it would fill up the library pretty fast.

00:22:03.352 --> 00:22:06.676
Did you sometimes see students asleep?

00:22:06.976 --> 00:22:07.456
Yes.

00:22:07.476 --> 00:22:11.280
Well, we did, and particularly during final week, we would see them asleep.

00:22:11.821 --> 00:22:30.861
In fact, during my later years, they used to bring their bed rolls and their, yes, this is true, they used to bring their bed rolls and they had their, you know, water canteens and lunches and whatever else they brought, and they'd stay all night in the stacks.

00:22:31.364 --> 00:22:42.916
And several times we found that some of them had managed to get into a faculty carrel and set up housekeeping.

00:22:43.717 --> 00:22:50.064
And so this of course caused a little furor, but that was taken care of eventually.

00:22:50.164 --> 00:22:52.186
And none of that was legal?

00:22:52.406 --> 00:22:53.527
None of that was legal.

00:22:53.648 --> 00:22:55.089
None of that was of course legal.

00:22:55.469 --> 00:22:58.873
When you first began, the library closed at what time?

00:22:59.022 --> 00:23:03.348
I think the library closed at 10 o'clock.

00:23:03.528 --> 00:23:05.852
I'm not absolutely positive about that.

00:23:06.553 --> 00:23:08.896
And then on Sundays?

00:23:09.497 --> 00:23:11.339
It might have been open from 1 to 5.

00:23:13.622 --> 00:23:17.248
And on Saturdays from, it would close at 6.

00:23:17.648 --> 00:23:24.017
But I think it closed, on Saturdays I think the library pretty much up until,

00:23:24.773 --> 00:23:38.790
the recent years has closed till six, it might have been open from nine to nine, it may be open now, so that people can study, but the reference desks were not staffed after six o'clock.

00:23:39.471 --> 00:23:45.398
Where did you, in those early years, where did you and your colleagues have lunch?

00:23:46.222 --> 00:23:55.099
Well, I remember having lunch in, I don't know where I had lunch over when we were still in the Cushing building.

00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:56.401
I might have gone home for lunch.

00:23:56.882 --> 00:24:02.172
But now, after that, I used to eat in the staff lounge or go out.

00:24:02.392 --> 00:24:08.584
I actually rarely did go out during those days because we only had one hour and you were trying to keep your hours.

00:24:08.699 --> 00:24:11.923
And when you first arrived, parking for a librarian was where?

00:24:11.943 --> 00:24:13.866
Yes, was in where the addition is.

00:24:13.926 --> 00:24:17.150
That's where we all parked in this lot.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.191
Was it lot six?

00:24:18.732 --> 00:24:20.374
Lot six.

00:24:20.394 --> 00:24:23.178
Which is, of course, our library addition now.

00:24:23.538 --> 00:24:32.870
And when I come up from the parking garage now and I see that, look around and see that, I think, my goodness, that's quite a facility.

00:24:33.091 --> 00:24:37.997
The parking lot never seemed that big until I looked at this addition.

00:24:38.348 --> 00:24:41.373
Now, had you worked in a university library before coming out?

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:41.673
No.

00:24:41.693 --> 00:24:42.474
No, I had never.

00:24:42.875 --> 00:24:51.127
You see, I was a new, as I said, I didn't start my library degree until my youngest child, our youngest son was in sixth grade, fifth grade.

00:24:51.428 --> 00:24:57.317
And so, this meant that I had never had, I never had library experience before.

00:24:57.537 --> 00:25:03.847
And then I was just very briefly, just a few months in the Denver Public Library as a children's librarian.

00:25:03.867 --> 00:25:04.307
All right.

00:25:04.328 --> 00:25:07.292
Did your department head husband,

00:25:07.812 --> 00:25:12.901
offer any comments about the quality of the library here when he first got here, our holdings?

00:25:13.242 --> 00:25:18.691
I don't, I think he had enough of what he, of what they needed.

00:25:19.012 --> 00:25:25.804
I mean if I had been married to someone in the liberal arts or social sciences I would have heard a lot more I believe.

00:25:26.845 --> 00:25:31.153
But he had, there was enough material

00:25:31.927 --> 00:25:59.065
they had not only in the library but with different faculty had their own collections as we has as he has his own collection so this is this was not critical problem at that time but certainly it became so later and in terms of your recollections of those early years in terms of the staffing was the staff comparatively adequate in number of professionals

00:25:59.872 --> 00:26:03.857
I don't think it was ever adequate with the number of professionals.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:17.375
And while we're talking about staff, if there's nothing else that I get down here today, I want to stress how important the classified staff is.

00:26:17.495 --> 00:26:19.157
Well, this is true for any department.

00:26:19.518 --> 00:26:24.985
The support staff is so important to running anything.

00:26:25.454 --> 00:26:37.730
People working now were working very shortly after I came and they're still working and you know we depend completely on those people.

00:26:38.531 --> 00:26:41.675
We couldn't manage, we couldn't, it wouldn't go very far.

00:26:41.995 --> 00:26:44.198
Who are the ones that you most remember?

00:26:44.218 --> 00:26:52.609
The ones that I most remember of course would be Kathy Taylor and Kathy Taylor

00:26:52.808 --> 00:26:54.970
of Dale Craxton.

00:26:56.152 --> 00:26:57.954
Spell it, Bill Craxton.

00:26:59.155 --> 00:27:02.959
Dale Craxton is in, she's in documents, I think.

00:27:03.019 --> 00:27:03.399
Spell it.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.604
Craxton, C-R-A-X-T-O-N, Dale Craxton.

00:27:07.864 --> 00:27:09.866
And what made them such outstanding?

00:27:09.886 --> 00:27:14.271
Well, because they got, and you know, how about someone like Bill Page?

00:27:14.291 --> 00:27:16.754
All these people know the collections.

00:27:17.795 --> 00:27:20.638
They know how to find what, when,

00:27:21.412 --> 00:27:24.056
without making waves about it.

00:27:25.678 --> 00:27:29.904
You know, they're really superb, superb staff members.

00:27:29.944 --> 00:27:32.007
And there were many others that I could mention.

00:27:32.608 --> 00:27:41.821
Another one I could mention in the technical services would have been Dorothy Kelly, who I understand now is over at the Bush Library cataloging for free.

00:27:42.221 --> 00:27:43.283
Well, that's pretty neat.

00:27:43.443 --> 00:27:48.550
If you're still going to do that in your retirement years, I think that's plenty nice.

00:27:49.947 --> 00:27:54.293
But these people are really dedicated.

00:27:54.934 --> 00:28:13.761
Of course, they have the same kind of hours as we all did, and they had their problems just like we all did, but they all managed to come through with flying colors.

00:28:13.893 --> 00:28:24.585
My mind recalls a person from my acquaintance in the first years, and I wonder if she was still here when you got here, Mrs. Segariff in Acquisitions?

00:28:25.225 --> 00:28:27.628
Yeah, I think, I don't know if she's still here.

00:28:28.008 --> 00:28:31.652
No, then, was she here then when you got here?

00:28:32.173 --> 00:28:35.617
No, I don't think she was here then, but I remember her, of course, yeah.

00:28:35.637 --> 00:28:42.064
See, her husband was retired, he was deceased by then, but he had been in the history department many years.

00:28:42.084 --> 00:28:43.225
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:28:43.357 --> 00:28:55.269
And she would let us know as the budget was about to end up if there were some departments that hadn't spent all of their money and it was going to revert back.

00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:59.974
And so we in the history department would turn in some extra orders.

00:29:00.114 --> 00:29:00.855
Oh, I see.

00:29:00.975 --> 00:29:01.676
How wonderful.

00:29:02.416 --> 00:29:03.037
Well, good.

00:29:03.578 --> 00:29:05.760
Glad you got a little bit of it.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:10.765
And there were two or three of us that ate our sack lunches together and about once a week.

00:29:10.745 --> 00:29:20.846
we would come over and she would allow us to go through in the acquisitions room the newly acquired material just to see what was coming in.

00:29:20.866 --> 00:29:22.449
Just to see what was coming in.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:31.588
And now I've been down in the first floor when I first got here looking at some of the new things and that is really something.

00:29:32.193 --> 00:29:37.402
Now, let's shift away from the library a little to the community.

00:29:37.882 --> 00:29:43.772
Describe moving into a new community and making friends and getting settled in.

00:29:44.513 --> 00:29:49.421
Well, it was, of course, it was very, it was hard for my children.

00:29:49.662 --> 00:29:51.805
One, of course, our oldest boy was in college.

00:29:52.392 --> 00:29:55.075
But there are two younger boys.

00:29:55.215 --> 00:29:57.458
One was in the ninth grade and one was in the eighth grade.

00:29:58.179 --> 00:30:01.703
And they were, of course, coming from the Denver schools, which were very good.

00:30:01.964 --> 00:30:05.148
This was where they were way behind.

00:30:05.188 --> 00:30:06.189
They caught up, of course.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:08.292
But they never had to work in high school.

00:30:08.312 --> 00:30:11.976
They didn't have to start working hard until they got into college.

00:30:12.837 --> 00:30:14.319
But then I don't, you know.

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:17.363
And of course, it was a whole new world for them.

00:30:17.803 --> 00:30:20.847
It was just as much of a shock for them as it was for me.

00:30:21.282 --> 00:30:30.953
Now for Bob it was a challenge because he, you know, we all realize he's a born teacher and I will say that without any qualms.

00:30:30.993 --> 00:30:42.305
He'd been in industry that helped a lot in the petroleum geology business, but he really just loves teaching and there was no question about it.

00:30:43.226 --> 00:30:50.614
And where did you all, who were some of the close friends you made quickly?

00:30:50.628 --> 00:30:57.458
Well, back then, you know, it was pretty much on a departmental kind of basis.

00:30:57.558 --> 00:31:07.573
But as I got to meet as many people as I did at the university, I got to meet from all departments.

00:31:08.955 --> 00:31:15.184
But still, I think that for quite a while there, you probably remember.
