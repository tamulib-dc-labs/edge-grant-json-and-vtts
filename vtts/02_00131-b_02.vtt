WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:07.760
About integration, that's kind of at a level where I can deal with.

00:09.322 --> 00:15.692
But then some people would come and talk about different people on the commandant staff that they felt weren't being effective.

00:16.273 --> 00:19.959
And you get out of my hands, but they'll go to anybody that'll listen.

00:21.401 --> 00:28.873
And by and large, the advice you got about being Corps Commander came from within the Corps.

00:29.832 --> 00:34.882
No, it came from a lot outside, too, about being Corps Commander.

00:34.902 --> 00:35.664
It came from both.

00:36.225 --> 00:40.574
There were people in the Corps that had certain expectations.

00:42.117 --> 00:45.423
This is where it gets kind of really hard to explain.

00:45.944 --> 00:49.832
There are a set of things that you need to accomplish that are short-term.

00:50.082 --> 00:55.011
which are probably much more of the concerns that the cadets see.

00:55.812 --> 00:57.755
And those are the ones that they usually talk to you about.

00:58.316 --> 01:02.985
But then there's a whole other set of long-term problems out there, long-term issues that need to be dealt with.

01:03.345 --> 01:06.831
They usually are very rarely raised with students or cadets.

01:07.653 --> 01:09.576
More often raised by people who

01:09.927 --> 01:12.009
Sometimes want to make you think about things.

01:12.090 --> 01:19.719
Maybe it was officers who just weren't trying to get you to make a decision about anything, but just wanted to sit down in the office and just vent for a little bit.

01:21.361 --> 01:30.872
It was varied from person to person, and those are the ones that I think I enjoyed working on the most, but also found that there was no real answer to them, and they were the hardest to solve.

01:31.966 --> 01:37.152
All right, so senior year you get back to campus what time?

01:37.793 --> 01:38.053
When?

01:38.694 --> 01:46.223
I was here, like I said, for the first part of the summer and then I left, I think I left July 2nd or something like that to go to Fort Lewis.

01:46.323 --> 02:01.602
Returned somewhere early August, maybe that first or second, I guess it was the second week of August I returned and at that point then I was here for good and things were rolling very quickly by the middle of August.

02:02.122 --> 02:07.511
Your staff, core staff, included about how many people?

02:08.433 --> 02:11.418
It included about 20 people, I think.

02:12.300 --> 02:17.348
And then what kind of secretarial clerical staff does core leadership have?

02:17.469 --> 02:20.814
We had two clerks that were sophomore members of the core.

02:21.395 --> 02:22.898
Sometimes I think we'd have three.

02:22.878 --> 02:24.942
But a lot of it was done on our own.

02:26.285 --> 02:28.169
We didn't really have any secretaries or anything like that.

02:28.209 --> 02:31.757
It would have been nice, but no, most of it we did by hand.

02:31.897 --> 02:36.848
We had resources and stuff available to our use, copy machines and things like that.

02:37.369 --> 02:42.760
What were the first activities that fall for a Corps commander to worry about?

02:42.740 --> 02:49.187
Mostly, the first things to do were to have all the meetings.

02:49.207 --> 02:57.155
There's always a huge long meetings we have with all the commanders, trying to get them set for the start about the policies that exist, the things that they're responsible for.

02:58.056 --> 03:11.110
And that quickly turns over to planning for FOW, getting all the things ready, making sure that we have names and all the paperwork and everything associated with all those cadets coming in.

03:11.090 --> 03:26.314
our activities and everything planned properly and appropriately for all those cadets that are coming in so it shifts very very quickly to that and then very quickly to regular year activities because by the time you get halfway through FOW you're sitting four days away

03:26.294 --> 03:28.897
from the start of the school year.

03:29.257 --> 03:32.820
F-O-W, Freshman Orientation Week.

03:32.921 --> 03:33.301
Oh, okay.

03:33.421 --> 03:33.861
No, that's okay.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.243
No, that's new slang on me.

03:35.283 --> 03:35.843
I hadn't heard that.

03:35.863 --> 03:36.484
That's okay.

03:36.504 --> 03:39.847
F-O-W, okay.

03:39.867 --> 03:47.735
And was there any, that fall, was there any change up or down in freshman core membership?

03:49.237 --> 03:50.318
During my senior year?

03:51.539 --> 03:54.782
I think that it was probably pretty consistent with the year before.

03:55.100 --> 04:05.253
There was a huge increase my sophomore year and a big decrease my junior year and then kind of consistent.

04:05.313 --> 04:05.634
Why that?

04:07.236 --> 04:08.177
I don't really know.

04:08.217 --> 04:12.643
It's really hard to evaluate, I think, the Corps right now.

04:12.683 --> 04:14.425
I could take some educated guesses at it.

04:14.585 --> 04:20.834
The dynamics of this university and the Corps of Cadets have really changed just in the five years that I've been here.

04:20.854 --> 04:25.039
So I can't really, it's really hard to evaluate that.

04:25.019 --> 04:32.466
Then the first activity that you, the first formal activity that fall was what, after freshman orientation?

04:32.647 --> 04:34.088
I think we were getting ready for football games.

04:34.108 --> 04:46.781
You got core marchings to play in, you've got, I think we had some different core meetings that we had scheduled, some speakers for them to come in, so, for freshmen to listen to, and so it got rolling pretty quickly.

04:46.801 --> 04:50.284
Alright, describe the dormitory room for the core commander.

04:50.703 --> 04:51.405
Oh, I don't know.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.707
It was the same size.

04:52.828 --> 04:57.117
The only difference is I was able to have carpet and television and things like that.

04:57.137 --> 04:57.939
And you were by yourself?

04:58.701 --> 04:59.803
Yes, I was by myself.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.670
I don't know if that really mattered to me.

05:03.231 --> 05:05.877
I would have been willing to have a roommate, but I was by myself.

05:06.262 --> 05:09.545
So, you know, we're able to have all the things that you'd want in the dorm room.

05:10.386 --> 05:14.330
And about what time normally did you, were you awake?

05:15.211 --> 05:16.952
I was usually awake by 5.30, same time.

05:17.073 --> 05:19.335
I had never, the time really never changed in the morning.

05:20.075 --> 05:21.597
And went to sleep at about what time?

05:21.617 --> 05:22.878
Well, that's the only thing that did change.

05:22.918 --> 05:24.460
It usually got later and later every year.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.403
So, you know, I don't know.

05:27.443 --> 05:32.608
Some nights were very, very long, you know, way into the wee hours of the morning.

05:32.668 --> 05:35.070
And other nights you were able to get in bed by midnight or whatever.

05:35.050 --> 05:40.399
Did a freshman come to your room to get your stuff ready?

05:40.980 --> 05:42.643
No, I always did all the stuff myself.

05:42.703 --> 05:45.127
I never had a freshman get anything ready for me.

05:45.147 --> 05:52.519
And in the, so you had to be out there ready for the march in at what time in the mornings?

05:52.499 --> 05:55.562
Oh, you mean for formation or for the Corps marches?

05:55.582 --> 05:56.243
Oh, for formation.

05:56.263 --> 05:56.683
Formation.

05:57.464 --> 06:05.273
We were usually out there probably about 15 minutes or so before it started, so, you know, 625, 620, something like that.

06:05.473 --> 06:05.673
All right.

06:05.693 --> 06:10.538
Now, I've not interviewed a Corps commander before, so some of my questions may be naive.

06:10.578 --> 06:11.099
No, that's okay.

06:11.319 --> 06:16.184
What was the routine in the dining hall for the Corps commander's mess?

06:16.885 --> 06:17.165
Sure.

06:17.406 --> 06:19.688
Actually, I very rarely ate.

06:19.668 --> 06:30.233
Most of the time I either had to eat later after everybody left or sometimes I guess I would eat early, but that was usually not really possible.

06:30.854 --> 06:37.710
So most of the time I spent walking around trying to take care of different problems that were going on.

06:37.994 --> 06:42.181
And I tried not to deal with the problems because really the other commanders needed to deal with the problems.

06:43.923 --> 06:46.267
But you have to point that out to them, that they need to correct that.

06:46.347 --> 06:54.400
So when you've got 2,000 people all at one time in a dining hall, you very quickly find yourself running from side to side trying to

06:55.375 --> 07:03.638
take care of everything, anything from food being thrown to, you know, some freshman being asked to do something he shouldn't be doing, so it just depends.

07:03.698 --> 07:09.013
How soon was it that fall before somebody attempted to play a trick on the corps commander?

07:09.280 --> 07:11.482
Oh, I got, I was always regularly.

07:12.503 --> 07:20.290
I mean, anything from, I think this happened all in one day, well, in a 24-hour span, and this was not uncommon.

07:20.310 --> 07:25.916
So I remember the, this was towards the end of the year, but it still didn't really matter.

07:26.296 --> 07:31.941
I was passing down my four diamonds to the freshman class.

07:31.981 --> 07:32.862
So I'd had them outside.

07:33.363 --> 07:36.065
I remember joking around with them because it was just a freshman class.

07:36.085 --> 07:39.068
And before I threw them kind of out into the crowd,

07:39.048 --> 07:44.296
said, you know, talked about it's not about positions and things like that, which I really don't believe it is about positions.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.982
You know, it's enjoying everything else that's a part of it.

07:48.002 --> 07:58.179
And I said, it's kind of like running across the banfield like I did numerous times, only for the band freshman to get very, you know, upset and flustered by the fact that their corps commander had run across the banfield.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.444
So they proceeded very quickly after I got done to

08:01.812 --> 08:10.244
you know, they ran after me, tackled me down, and then threw me in the fish pond, I guess within a couple of minutes.

08:10.885 --> 08:28.651
So they did that, then came back, and as I was taking a shower because I needed to get out of my, because I was in uniform, they threw me in the fish pond in the uniform, hung my uniform outside my door in time for C1 to think that it was pretty funny that I had talked about all the times I'd stole upperclassmen's uniform that same 30 minutes beforehand.

08:29.152 --> 08:31.195
So they decided to take my uniform,

08:31.377 --> 08:35.725
right after I just got thrown in fishpond, and they locked it in a footlocker upstairs.

08:37.207 --> 08:37.968
So that was fine.

08:38.069 --> 08:40.913
They wanted to play that game.

08:40.934 --> 08:41.394
That's okay.

08:41.414 --> 08:49.909
I don't mind it because I usually just took items out of their room and threw it out the window until they decided they didn't want me to throw anything else out the window.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.506
And they didn't realize I had a passkey to get into every room and all these kind of things.

08:54.526 --> 08:57.391
But I came back that next morning.

08:57.431 --> 08:59.876
And now the freshman in E2 saw me coming outside.

08:59.896 --> 09:01.558
I was going to take my dry cleaning down.

09:02.380 --> 09:03.361
And this is that next morning.

09:03.442 --> 09:08.370
And they then proceeded to come all wildcat and all 40 of them come wildcat and out the door.

09:08.806 --> 09:10.188
And I didn't, you know, that wasn't weird.

09:10.228 --> 09:11.531
It was 7.45 in the morning.

09:12.192 --> 09:13.734
Certainly didn't know what they were doing, but whatever.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.018
Well, I noticed they were coming after me.

09:16.459 --> 09:17.281
So I started running.

09:17.321 --> 09:18.142
I didn't know where to go.

09:18.202 --> 09:19.584
And I just started running.

09:19.625 --> 09:25.735
Finally, they grabbed me and threw me through the mud, threw me, just totally threw me through the mud and said, thanks for being a good sport and ran off.

09:25.934 --> 09:31.787
So I was like, okay, whatever, you know, because I realized this is all stemming from that one conversation I had with them just the night before.

09:32.409 --> 09:36.337
Went and took a shower, came back out, 20 minutes later, here they come running out the warm again.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.963
Come and tackle me again and throw me through the mud.

09:39.825 --> 09:42.070
You know, and this is the kind of stuff that happens all the time.

09:42.271 --> 09:45.478
Always got thrown in the mud, always got picked on, but that's okay.

09:46.015 --> 09:51.627
Were there any pranks that you endured that did you any physical harm?

09:51.647 --> 09:52.649
No.

09:52.669 --> 09:55.495
I mean, if you want to be considered throwing through the mud, physical harm.

09:56.998 --> 09:58.461
You didn't dislocate a thumb?

09:58.661 --> 09:59.443
No, no.

09:59.503 --> 10:04.193
I never dislocated anything or broke anything or anything like that.

10:04.173 --> 10:05.535
And most of the time I didn't care either.

10:05.595 --> 10:06.537
I didn't fight it either.

10:06.577 --> 10:11.586
I thought it was funny and always B.S.

10:11.646 --> 10:14.110
with them when they were doing something to me, so it was funny.

10:14.130 --> 10:17.496
What was your way of letting them know, okay, folks, that's enough.

10:17.556 --> 10:19.279
I got something I got to do.

10:19.917 --> 10:21.980
Usually I was pretty straightforward with them.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.285
I mean, you know, it took me a while sometimes to convince them that there was something I really, really needed to do.

10:26.786 --> 10:30.250
But it was so rare that I ever said anything like that.

10:31.212 --> 10:32.453
Most of the times I just dealt with it.

10:33.535 --> 10:39.242
So if I really did say that I needed to do it, usually they were kind of surprised by that and then would stop.

10:39.644 --> 10:44.671
Describe some of the serious matters you had to deal with during that year.

10:45.472 --> 10:48.596
Oh, well, that's a tough question.

10:49.076 --> 10:50.678
There was a wide, wide range of it.

10:52.601 --> 10:59.610
Some of the typical problems that you have to deal with that are serious are, you know, there are always things that upperclassmen or

11:00.063 --> 11:03.406
Cadets just period do that require removal from the Corps.

11:05.468 --> 11:07.891
So you have to deal with that disciplinary action.

11:07.971 --> 11:10.794
There's always different things that require different disciplinary actions.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.337
What were some of those that were serious enough that could be?

11:14.357 --> 11:15.959
Some of them are alcohol violations.

11:16.059 --> 11:17.400
Some of them are hazing.

11:17.521 --> 11:21.344
You know, some of them are hazing violations and that do cause physical harm.

11:21.364 --> 11:22.245
You have to deal with that.

11:23.547 --> 11:24.948
Sometimes it's grade problems.

11:25.028 --> 11:25.969
Sometimes it's

11:25.949 --> 11:29.575
You know, sometimes theft and things like that that you have to deal with.

11:29.635 --> 11:32.079
So, you know, it varies.

11:32.099 --> 11:35.805
I'm not going to say all these things happen often, but they do happen and you do have to deal with them.

11:36.786 --> 11:41.494
Those were typical, I think, that any kind of corps commander would have to deal with.

11:41.947 --> 11:43.950
Then I deal with a lot of things that weren't typical.

11:44.351 --> 11:54.729
I dealt with everything from, I know a freshman that year got into a very, very bad car accident that killed, I think, about six people or seven people that October.

11:55.550 --> 12:01.120
He was asleep, drowsy, driving back, and there was a party across the street.

12:01.100 --> 12:04.445
right down at university.

12:05.567 --> 12:17.827
So that was the first thing I think that I dealt with that was complicated and we were really concerned about a lot of press issues and things like that with the Corps, only to turn around a month later and deal with a bonfire accident.

12:18.348 --> 12:23.376
So, you know, there were a lot of things that weren't typical, I think, that year that I dealt with that were a lot serious.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.960
How did you first hear about a bonfire?

12:26.412 --> 12:31.596
One of my commanders called me within minutes.

12:31.937 --> 12:33.918
I don't even know if minutes is really fair enough.

12:34.519 --> 12:35.780
It was probably quicker than that.

12:36.601 --> 12:37.061
Called me.

12:37.441 --> 12:38.322
It was late in the evening.

12:38.582 --> 12:47.450
I was up studying, had a project due, and he called me to let me know that some of the members in the band had been called out.

12:47.470 --> 12:52.414
They were paramedics and EMT certified, and they had been called out to come out there.

12:53.195 --> 12:55.997
And so he said, I don't know what's going on, but you might want to go out there and check in.

12:55.977 --> 13:08.350
So I went across the room, told the Deputy Corps Commander, Mark Masacek, to go out there and to call Dr. Sullen, who was the Vice President for Student Affairs, call him that I didn't know what was going on, but that paramedics had been called out there.

13:08.912 --> 13:11.218
In the meantime, I jumped in my car and ran down there.

13:11.452 --> 13:17.906
And it had to have been quick because I was there just as quickly as the police were.

13:18.347 --> 13:20.973
And they were there within five or ten minutes of what was happening.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.877
So it was pretty quick.

13:23.178 --> 13:27.688
What was your first impression of how serious the event was?

13:27.668 --> 13:29.490
It didn't take long for me to recognize.

13:29.530 --> 13:31.373
It was pretty instantaneous.

13:31.413 --> 13:36.759
The bonfire was almost completely built.

13:37.520 --> 13:45.149
So the fact that it was completely fallen and I knew that there were people on the stack didn't take very long for me to recognize it was very serious.

13:46.131 --> 13:48.073
Were there any human noises?

13:48.053 --> 13:48.954
that you could hear?

13:49.015 --> 13:50.537
Could you hear anybody crying or moaning?

13:50.717 --> 13:51.519
Oh, there was tons.

13:51.819 --> 13:52.620
There was tons of it.

13:52.801 --> 13:55.084
Oh, yeah.

13:55.966 --> 13:56.927
There was plenty of it.

13:58.290 --> 14:01.515
Some of it was from people who were injured and some of it were people who were out there.

14:02.757 --> 14:04.159
Spectators is not the right word.

14:04.199 --> 14:08.446
People who are clearly out there trying to find friends or things like that.

14:09.328 --> 14:10.770
So it was...

14:11.088 --> 14:14.039
There were certainly a lot of people out there and it varied.

14:14.701 --> 14:16.006
And you stayed about how long?

14:16.708 --> 14:19.057
I didn't leave until 2 p.m.

14:19.097 --> 14:21.385
that next afternoon.

14:21.702 --> 14:22.964
Close to 12, 13 hours.

14:23.545 --> 14:32.919
Is there anything, in hindsight, can you think of anything that anybody might have done following the accident that we didn't do?

14:33.720 --> 14:38.828
Were there any... There are a lot of things, and I think you find that in all the reports that exist today.

14:38.888 --> 14:44.497
You know, just different teaching, different courses that taught people how to do this stuff.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.258
Are you talking about that?

14:45.278 --> 14:46.039
No, no, no.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.522
Oh, just the accident itself?

14:47.563 --> 14:49.086
The accident has happened.

14:49.106 --> 14:49.307
Right.

14:49.427 --> 14:52.073
Is there anything that... To do to correct the accident?

14:52.113 --> 14:55.260
No, that we could have done to respond to it instantly.

14:55.381 --> 14:57.004
You know, there's been a car wreck.

14:57.425 --> 14:57.686
Right.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.330
Oh, I don't know.

15:00.492 --> 15:01.615
Like, I've not heard of any...

15:01.848 --> 15:02.950
You know, I don't know.

15:02.970 --> 15:09.521
I've spent a lot of times, I've been interviewed by different people who are doing their dissertations and stuff like that on crisis management and stuff like that.

15:09.582 --> 15:13.809
And in all honesty, I don't think there's another comparable accident out there.

15:14.250 --> 15:19.519
I've looked at their research just because they show it to me as they interview me and try to get a different insight.

15:20.157 --> 15:21.219
And I don't know.

15:21.459 --> 15:25.144
I don't know if there is a better way to deal with a situation like that.

15:25.324 --> 15:34.698
I think we handled it very well considering the circumstances and the response from the people that were out there was very quick.

15:35.319 --> 15:42.309
It took a little while to get organized out there and that was frustrating trying to get that taken care of.

15:42.349 --> 15:44.612
I don't think it was until probably

15:45.200 --> 15:47.949
about close to 4, 5 a.m.

15:48.270 --> 15:57.842
in the morning before we really were starting to get organized with phone numbers and communication lines set up and things like that.

15:58.092 --> 16:03.882
So it really did take a good two plus hours to get situated, and that was difficult.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.569
But at the same time, I don't know how you would have made that quicker.

16:09.011 --> 16:21.433
And considering that there were so many students involved, I don't know how you prepare 22-year-olds or 20-year-olds or whatever to respond quicker than they did.

16:21.413 --> 16:29.684
If you're dealing with a situation where it's 100% professionals out there doing the work, I think you have a quicker response time.

16:29.704 --> 16:32.127
But on a campus, that's not a reality.

16:32.267 --> 16:34.630
So I don't know if there is something better.

16:35.451 --> 16:41.659
I tell people I believe A&M responded about as well as a group of human beings could.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.003
No question it was a... I mean, the community was good.

16:45.323 --> 16:46.205
The community was great.

16:46.225 --> 16:48.147
I mean, I think even that afternoon,

16:48.127 --> 16:49.448
You know, a lot of us hadn't eaten.

16:49.488 --> 16:50.990
We'd been up late and stuff like that.

16:51.450 --> 17:02.341
And so a lot of us, you know, people had food out there, different restaurants and stuff like that had provided whatever, drinks, food, you know, even places to rest.

17:02.962 --> 17:05.925
So, you know, the response from everybody was really good.

17:07.006 --> 17:18.117
And as far as I know, every student organization and so forth, how soon was it that some reporter cornered you to try to interview you?

17:18.097 --> 17:19.438
Not very long at all.

17:21.761 --> 17:27.727
I guess because I didn't really leave the perimeter, because I was inside the perimeter.

17:27.747 --> 17:35.514
I didn't leave the perimeter until late that, or I guess early afternoon, that I really wasn't called to do anything with the media.

17:36.015 --> 17:40.840
It didn't take long for once I got out of that perimeter to go to dozens of interviews.

17:41.320 --> 17:48.087
So it didn't take very long at all, but in a weird way, that perimeter was a shelter in some respects and wasn't in others.

17:48.151 --> 17:48.852
It was interesting.

17:49.033 --> 17:56.107
And I'm assuming that you were then called at every, almost at any time, night or day for a long time.

17:56.127 --> 17:56.567
It was bad.

17:56.587 --> 18:00.896
That was the first real big media exposure that I had ever had to deal with.

18:01.337 --> 18:05.846
And so that was complicated trying to learn how to deal with the media.

18:05.866 --> 18:09.653
I'll learn quickly, but you'll also make mistakes in learning those things.

18:09.633 --> 18:38.847
and once you open yourself up to talking to media you open yourself up to everybody and i it did i think that's when i for also got a bad taste in my mouth for some of the media i had newspaper reporters that would just come into the dormitories and you know this is a day after or so would come into the dormitories and i mean just hand me a card and say i'll be 10 minutes of your time didn't even introduce themselves we had to kick another reporter out of a dorm who because he was trying to interview

18:38.827 --> 18:41.835
the roommate of one of the guys who died.

18:42.698 --> 18:46.749
And, you know, didn't ask to come in, didn't ask for anything, so we had to kick him out.

18:47.731 --> 18:51.883
So it got very, very busy from there.

18:52.063 --> 18:53.848
And, I mean, there must have been...

18:53.828 --> 19:08.901
I don't really recall how many television cameras they had set up out there, but I would not feel like I'd overestimated it if I told you there were 20 plus set up on the site, on the north side, looking past the mesh fencing into the bonfire perimeter.

19:08.881 --> 19:17.930
And did you feel instantly that the A&M family was pulling together?

19:18.511 --> 19:19.592
At that time, absolutely.

19:19.873 --> 19:27.260
I think people were very, very good to each other, very pulled together, really helped each other out without question.

19:27.460 --> 19:33.707
And I presume that consumed awesome amounts of your time for weeks, months.

19:34.312 --> 19:37.355
I don't, it hasn't really stopped since then.

19:37.375 --> 19:39.176
And this is almost a year and a half later.

19:39.376 --> 19:43.720
Do you still get people, folks like me, asking you about?

19:45.121 --> 19:46.222
Yes, it hasn't stopped.

19:46.242 --> 19:46.983
And that's okay.

19:47.023 --> 19:50.386
I mean, that's part of it, and you have to assume that and understand that.

19:51.467 --> 19:52.208
But it hasn't stopped.

19:52.588 --> 20:00.134
Different, obviously, it has changed in what it is that people are looking for as the time has gone on.

20:01.015 --> 20:04.318
But it's been something that I've had to deal with ever since.

20:04.298 --> 20:07.988
All right, let's shift to a lighter moment.

20:08.369 --> 20:14.967
What are some of the fun things that you got to be a part of as a Corps commander?

20:15.892 --> 20:17.334
Oh, tons of them.

20:17.354 --> 20:18.897
The Corps troops were always exciting.

20:19.458 --> 20:27.711
Doing things with the Corps away is an incredibly neat experience that I enjoyed very, very much.

20:28.553 --> 20:31.518
I got to take some incredible trips.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.826
I guess maybe not Corps commander, but junior year we went up to New York to see the Florida State game.

20:37.588 --> 20:41.494
One of the best trips that I took, although the whole Corps didn't go, it was

20:41.474 --> 20:42.640
Very, very neat.

20:43.464 --> 20:47.805
Junior year into junior year and this is kind of all merges together but

20:48.038 --> 20:51.682
We went to the Sugar Bowl, and that was incredibly fun to go to.

20:52.984 --> 20:55.226
Senior year, went to the Alamo Bowl, and that was fun.

20:55.266 --> 20:57.529
We took a Corps trip down to San Antonio and did that.

20:58.370 --> 20:59.771
So the trips were fun.

20:59.811 --> 21:01.033
The trips were very, very neat.

21:01.714 --> 21:11.144
I got a chance, I think, once that summer, right before I started the Corps Commander year, to go down and have lunch with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and that was fun.

21:12.446 --> 21:15.149
So a lot of experiences I wouldn't have ever had anywhere else.

21:15.209 --> 21:17.151
What other celebrities did you encounter?

21:18.633 --> 21:19.715
Oh, I don't know.

21:19.755 --> 21:34.127
They're not necessarily related to Corps Commander, but everything from us being the governor, and obviously we were down there with the, well, I guess this is after Corps Commander year,

21:34.107 --> 21:39.896
the presidential election and Rick Perry moving into the governor's seat.

21:40.016 --> 21:44.663
A lot of politicians, but that also comes from being a political science major.

21:44.683 --> 21:50.833
That also comes from working with congressional members and state representatives and things like that.

21:51.100 --> 22:08.280
I've had the opportunity to meet a lot of those people, but also when they opened the George Bush School, and that was before, I guess that was my sophomore year, when they opened the George Bush Library, George Bush School, they had everybody you can imagine that was down here, everything from movie stars to politicians.

22:08.320 --> 22:12.184
So, you know, that, it's just been varied, but it's been fun.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.426
All those things have been incredible.

22:13.686 --> 22:19.993
You can't really... What's the goofiest thing you remember from Corps Commander year?

22:20.277 --> 22:21.118
Goofiest thing?

22:21.298 --> 22:22.719
I'm not really sure.

22:22.779 --> 22:26.863
I think being all that stuff that happened in a 24-hour span was pretty crazy.

22:26.923 --> 22:32.228
I had, during Ewok, all the juniors from my outfit came and tied me up.

22:32.768 --> 22:38.333
They tied me up and left me in my room, locked my room so nobody could get in, and there was no passkey in my room.

22:38.794 --> 22:39.935
And then they went out my window.

22:41.076 --> 22:43.818
So that way it was almost impossible to get into my room.

22:45.360 --> 22:50.284
Of what are you most proud of for that year, you personally?

22:51.614 --> 22:56.865
I think we made a lot of impacts in terms of really modernizing the Corps.

22:58.088 --> 23:08.110
We made a lot of impacts, I think, in terms of trying to organize the Corps a little bit more logistically and things like that and improve some of the recruiting aspects of the Corps.

23:09.293 --> 23:11.277
I think a lot of those things were done.

23:11.257 --> 23:14.827
But, you know, you only have time to do so much, and that's what's frustrating about it.

23:16.933 --> 23:18.879
Because we're willing to do a lot of things.

23:19.079 --> 23:23.933
I know it sounds crazy, and I'm sure people 50 years from now will laugh, but...

23:24.908 --> 23:28.655
But that was the first time we had ever shifted to a totally paperless information system.

23:30.418 --> 23:33.623
We had a lot of young guys who were willing to put all that together.

23:34.505 --> 23:40.776
And even just a year before, just cranking out paper copies and things like that.

23:41.136 --> 23:46.706
Which is really even funny because I had all the files from guys that were four or five years older than me who'd done it all on typewriter.

23:47.047 --> 23:48.269
So it changed very, very quickly.

23:48.289 --> 23:49.431
It wasn't like it just...

23:49.411 --> 23:50.913
Happened over 20 year span.

23:50.953 --> 24:04.651
It happened very very fast over five six seven year span and So that was it was tough to keep up with that But the things that are available on those websites now are state-of-the-art at least for today And and that was I was proud to be able to do that.

24:04.751 --> 24:13.022
I think that that has allowed us to do so much Has allowed us to become more efficient and those are things that nobody would have ever thought of and

24:13.002 --> 24:14.344
two or three years before.

24:15.025 --> 24:16.768
So I felt like I thought outside of the box.

24:16.848 --> 24:17.970
All right, now that one's pride.

24:18.010 --> 24:19.092
The next one is goofy.

24:20.274 --> 24:24.080
What's something that you did that just didn't work out, it was goofy?

24:25.222 --> 24:28.547
You got your tang-tungled or got mixed up?

24:29.287 --> 24:34.174
Oh, we tried to have a fun run and tried to organize that, and that was a complete mess.

24:34.615 --> 24:39.822
Because I tried to do what other people learned how to do that, tried to take a step back.

24:40.223 --> 24:44.929
And, two, I can't manage it all myself, but you're trying to do a little bit of coaching while at the same time step in.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.992
The support wasn't there.

24:47.012 --> 24:47.974
It was a mess.

24:48.034 --> 24:49.336
But it was fun to do it.

24:49.356 --> 24:53.021
We had a good time doing it and enjoyed it a lot.

24:53.041 --> 24:56.346
But, no, it wasn't necessarily a success at all.

24:56.366 --> 24:56.526
Right.

24:56.506 --> 25:03.394
If you were advising a new corps commander today, what would be the key items of advice you'd give them?

25:03.458 --> 25:06.382
I wish I had about an hour or two hours to talk about that.

25:07.764 --> 25:15.115
I think the first thing is to really evaluate your philosophies as a person.

25:15.877 --> 25:18.861
It sounds easy, but it's hard to do.

25:19.782 --> 25:21.805
And I think, especially at this age, it's hard to do.

25:21.865 --> 25:28.355
Evaluate your philosophies, because in doing so, I think you will find what's really a priority to you and what's not a priority to you.

25:29.156 --> 25:32.301
And it's OK to not have the same priorities as someone else.

25:32.281 --> 25:37.987
But by establishing your priorities, you allow yourself to really shape what your goals ought to be.

25:39.148 --> 25:44.814
Because if something's a priority that isn't being portrayed that way, then clearly you know what you need to work on.

25:45.835 --> 25:48.518
I think it really helps to directionalize what you're doing.

25:48.718 --> 25:51.401
But it's also not an easy thing to do.

25:51.421 --> 25:51.681
All right.

25:51.841 --> 25:57.167
Then the next, your fifth year, you were president of the student body.

25:57.867 --> 26:00.550
At what point did you begin to dream of that?

26:01.441 --> 26:07.610
It was sometime late November, early December, but then fully recognizing that we were getting ready to go on Christmas break.

26:07.630 --> 26:09.132
I knew there really wasn't much we could do there.

26:09.613 --> 26:12.797
Did you think of that, or did somebody put the idea in your head?

26:13.017 --> 26:13.899
It was really somebody else.

26:13.999 --> 26:17.344
I mean, I had thought about it, but I really didn't seriously consider it.

26:18.024 --> 26:22.170
You know, I was very burned out, I think, at that time, just with a lot of things that had happened.

26:22.250 --> 26:24.073
I mean, it was only a month after the accident.

26:24.053 --> 26:25.495
with the bonfire accident.

26:26.056 --> 26:29.701
Just didn't really know if that's exactly what I wanted to do for another year.

26:30.962 --> 26:36.410
So that took a lot of time and consideration to think about, but it just escalated very quickly.

26:36.490 --> 26:43.099
It started with just somebody joking around, and next thing I know it was probably just three days later before we had done a lot of work.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.222
So it started very early.

26:45.542 --> 26:48.947
I know that three months sounds like a long time to prepare for a campaign,

26:48.927 --> 26:50.630
but it's really not.

26:51.191 --> 26:55.620
I mean there were people who started four months before me and that's just difficult.

26:55.640 --> 26:59.167
Who did you call on as your key assistants in that effort?

27:00.049 --> 27:02.734
Well the first thing I actually wound up having was some

27:03.035 --> 27:05.060
friends that were in the Corps from other outfits.

27:05.621 --> 27:16.687
The people that helped me the most during that time were some of the people that were on Corps staff but not in campaigning, helping me manage the Corps while I couldn't necessarily do all the things I would have liked to have done.

27:17.348 --> 27:19.052
And they did a wonderful job at that.

27:20.568 --> 27:33.463
Did, was there any, the student body president the year before, or that year, the year your corps commander, was he a corps member also?

27:33.483 --> 27:33.763
No.

27:34.144 --> 27:34.384
All right.

27:35.806 --> 27:43.875
The, as you are getting organized, did you begin to try to reach out to be inclusive?

27:44.497 --> 27:49.543
I've always been a very extroverted person.

27:50.104 --> 27:53.969
So I've always spent a lot of time outside the Corps as well as inside the Corps.

27:54.690 --> 27:56.993
So that wasn't necessarily a big challenge for me.

27:57.113 --> 28:03.521
It seems that it's been very cyclical in the Corps that Corps commanders one year tend to be very internally focused.

28:04.062 --> 28:07.246
Others tend to be very externally and concerned about the image of the Corps.

28:07.687 --> 28:11.512
And it's almost certain that every year it flips back and forth.

28:11.632 --> 28:12.353
I don't know why.

28:12.433 --> 28:14.115
It's not like we pick them for that reason.

28:14.095 --> 28:15.597
It just seems to happen that way.

28:16.297 --> 28:26.107
And I spent a lot of time trying to build the Corps' reputation outside the Corps of Cadets because I felt that I had competent people to manage the things inside the Corps of Cadets.

28:26.888 --> 28:31.773
And so that helped me to do a lot of things and work with people outside.

28:32.313 --> 28:38.860
So it wasn't necessarily a new thing that I was trying to learn how to do, but certainly there are things that you have to pick up.

28:39.961 --> 28:42.904
And what were the major points y'all tried to make in the campaign?

28:43.947 --> 28:56.480
Well, we try to talk about everything from, well, I think before I even say this, let me just clarify it with what you assume to be a problem when you start is not necessarily what really is a problem when you finish.

28:58.102 --> 29:04.949
I think when we started out, we tried to work with parking and we tried to establish more parking lots and better transportation systems.

29:05.009 --> 29:10.815
I mean, we've got 20-year-old, 25-year-old buses and trying to improve that.

29:10.795 --> 29:13.859
trying to improve some more leadership organizations.

29:13.879 --> 29:19.887
We don't have anything aimed at sophomores, which is ironic, considering we have so many freshman leadership organizations.

29:20.508 --> 29:29.560
So we really tried to focus on creating one of those and tried to, now that we have Aggie Bucks that are so readily used, and that's new.

29:29.880 --> 29:35.588
That started only three or four years ago, but has just boomed since they've come into existence.

29:35.568 --> 29:48.855
trying to expand that we've got that in different locations now that weren't available so that's what we started out talking about and what we wound up having to talk about were very different.

29:48.875 --> 29:50.117
What did you have to talk about?

29:50.452 --> 29:55.185
Well, when I got elected, we hadn't even determined what was the cause of bonfire yet.

29:55.285 --> 29:56.588
So there was no bonfire issue.

29:57.912 --> 29:59.556
That happened three weeks after I got elected.

29:59.676 --> 30:01.060
That became a very big issue.

30:02.664 --> 30:06.334
Parking wasn't a problem, even though people want to make it a problem.

30:06.314 --> 30:11.739
Transportation I guess is, but that's a lot bigger problem out there than just this campus.

30:11.899 --> 30:15.283
It has to deal with the infrastructure and a lot of different things with the city.

30:15.383 --> 30:17.205
So that's changed.

30:19.006 --> 30:29.136
So there were academic programs out there in terms of the fact that this school is getting harder to get into and how do we deal with the increased number of people that want to get in here.

30:29.757 --> 30:34.782
So working with community colleges and working with other universities, that was really a problem.

30:34.962 --> 30:35.983
Legislature.

30:35.963 --> 30:40.890
didn't take into account a lot of the things that happened in the legislative year.

30:41.391 --> 30:47.680
And those were very, very much impacted this year by the fact that we spent the whole spring working on that.

30:48.021 --> 30:50.965
So, you know, there's a lot of other things you don't realize once you get in there.

30:51.426 --> 30:53.308
And that's just the issue focused.

30:53.949 --> 30:57.034
I did not realize that student government had a thousand people in it.

30:57.054 --> 31:02.562
And I did not realize that student government also was not managed anything like what the MSC has.

31:02.542 --> 31:08.239
And so there were a lot of things internally to organize in that organization.

31:08.821 --> 31:10.165
So very, very different experiences.

31:10.185 --> 31:12.231
Was there much transition from
