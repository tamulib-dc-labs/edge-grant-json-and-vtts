WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:04.421
He became active that early then? Yeah. Oh, yeah. 
Yeah, he was active. He never was president of the

00:07.604 --> 00:19.756
association during my tenure, but he became 
president of the association shortly after Buck

00:07.604 --> 00:19.756
came in. Was he positive regarding these changes? 
I don't think he was real positive to start with.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.004
That would have been my guess. Yes. I think he was 
more on Earl's side. than anybody, but I think he,

00:32.127 --> 00:37.134
it came around, okay, was Royce. You were asking 
the big posers of that, the Beaumont A&M Club

00:37.595 --> 01:01.611
through Charlie Babcock's influence, and the 
Houston A&M Club to some extent through the

00:37.595 --> 01:01.611
influence of Mr. Travis Smith, and the A&M Mothers 
Club as a group,

01:01.895 --> 01:05.740
They didn't want any of the old traditions 
changed. But beyond that, the Aggies I think

01:05.760 --> 01:16.033
generally were positively responsive to the 
changes. You mentioned those two that have a

01:16.053 --> 01:26.086
little bit of a regional Beaumont and Houston, but 
by and large it wasn't engineers for and ag

01:16.053 --> 01:26.086
against. It didn't break down that way, did it? No, 
it didn't break down. No, it didn't break down by

01:30.650 --> 01:33.274
agriculture or engineers or anything like that. 
No, it was just

01:33.294 --> 01:39.603
the breaking of a tradition. There was no nothing 
like that. Let's see. We mentioned Hubert and...

01:54.045 --> 01:55.767
I'm trying to think of some of those people. Back in 
the early times when Earl first came back here,

02:01.328 --> 02:09.500
Well,

02:01.328 --> 02:09.500
I remember John Calhoun and Bob Kamm. Kamm took the 
place of Dean Pitberg. And John Calhoun, I'm not

02:13.907 --> 02:19.655
sure what his first position was. Was it Dean of 
Engineering? I think so. Okay, Dean of

02:22.079 --> 02:23.100
Engineering. Frank Hubert came back as Dean of 
Arts and Sciences. Dr. Bowden probably was here as

02:28.919 --> 02:34.886
dean of veterinary medicine. And agriculture. 
Patterson, I think. Dr. R.E. Patterson, and then,

02:38.030 --> 02:42.676
who was it? Begins with an A. Still. Begins with an 
A. Yeah.

02:52.027 --> 02:53.448
Why can't my brain recall? Agriculture? Wasn't 
Kunkel? No. Before Coco. Before Coco. I thought I

03:03.462 --> 03:05.926
had it written on some card in here. It was an A. 
Mount Shepardson. No, no.

03:13.918 --> 03:14.799
Gus Watkins. Wrong. Gus Watkins. Gus Watkins, 
yeah. Gus Watkins. I was wrong on that. Yeah, Gus

03:18.425 --> 03:19.667
Watkins. I remember Gus. And I, now, as far as 
you... Now, let me think a minute. I had my mind on

03:24.734 --> 03:26.517
two other people. One of the things that pleased 
Earl most back in that era was to be able to persuade

03:28.184 --> 03:48.392
these two chemists to come here from Pittsburgh or 
somewhere up there.

03:51.176 --> 03:56.183
Well,

03:51.176 --> 03:56.183
Zwolinski. and his partner. I can't think of the 
name of his partner because he died a long time ago.

04:04.241 --> 04:05.583
He died in 64 or 65. But they came down here from some 
chemical institute, Carnegie Tech or somewhere.

04:13.416 --> 04:21.529
And they were outstanding chemists and that was 
the beginning of trying to recruit some of the top

04:13.416 --> 04:21.529
people. course later on they got Zener and they got 
this doctor that was in physics. Well I remember

04:29.595 --> 04:30.275
Mr. Rudder saying sometimes when outstanding 
people were hired away from here, we're proud to

04:30.316 --> 04:37.403
have had them. And a few of us cynics at first 
thought that he was meaning well you know we're

04:38.985 --> 04:44.531
glad somebody else paid him more money. Then we 
realized no he was he was really saying we're glad

04:45.011 --> 04:48.495
that it that we're one of the places where the top 
schools- We've had them as long as we did. Yeah. Who

04:53.884 --> 05:03.358
are some other former students that you think 
deserve credit for helping A&M move forward from

04:53.884 --> 05:03.358
your experience? Well, I think, of course I've 
mentioned the top ones that I've been talking

05:04.860 --> 05:12.772
about. Dr. Harold Dunn, Jimmy Askins, Maggie 
McGee, John Mangus. And then the Weisenbakers.

05:27.561 --> 05:32.347
Royce Weisenbaker is the one that started the 
endowed presidential scholarship program. He

05:32.367 --> 05:34.730
put up the first one in Earl's name. Put up one in 
Buck's name. The Pete Petersons, only I disagreed

05:38.154 --> 05:41.538
with Pete. Pete disagreed with me on several 
things. Still, Pete was the president of the

05:44.702 --> 05:48.587
association. He later was a member of the board of 
directors of the institution, later a member of

05:49.951 --> 05:57.439
the board of coordinating boards.

05:58.180 --> 06:03.346
Pete Peterson and John Younger from West Texas. 
Let me tell you about a meeting we had with John

06:03.366 --> 06:06.930
Younger. John Younger, you can see

06:06.950 --> 06:12.996
the problem. As you probably know, A&M student 
body was called Mickey Mouse in those days. Aggies

06:21.490 --> 06:33.165
would go home and strut those boots up and down the 
halls with a shaved head and the students would lie

06:21.490 --> 06:33.165
down. And John Young

06:33.185 --> 06:41.395
called me and said, you'll get Earl and you'll come 
to Midland. I want to have a luncheon. It's not

06:44.579 --> 06:50.046
going to be the A&M Club, it's going to be me eating 
on the school board in Midland. He said, I want to

06:50.937 --> 06:52.720
have a luncheon. And I want to have the school 
superintendent and the high school principal

06:52.740 --> 06:58.929
present. And we're going to have a frank 
discussion.

07:03.455 --> 07:04.557
I remember with Maggie. Maggie and and I sat there 
and had a luncheon. And Earl. And Earl was more or

07:10.225 --> 07:13.910
less new at the job at the time. So it would have been 
in 58 or maybe 58. Before all this century

07:19.760 --> 07:28.408
business,

07:19.760 --> 07:28.408
aspirations and all that, we went to this country 
club in Midland. This superintendent and this

07:28.428 --> 07:36.056
president got to talk about A&M. These two men just 
told Earl just like he was. He said, Earl, I don't

07:41.701 --> 07:48.788
know, you don't realize it, I'm sure, but when 
these kids from A&M come to Midland, all these

07:41.701 --> 07:48.788
other kids laugh at them. And when you talk to these 
students in middle and high school about going to

07:50.708 --> 07:56.715
A&M, they just laugh. They're not about to go to 
A&M. They want to go to Texas Tech. They want to go to

08:02.701 --> 08:04.803
the University of Texas. Or they want to go to these 
teachers' colleges out there. They don't want to

08:08.247 --> 08:10.309
go to A&M. And Earl was in state shock. He said, why? 
He said, well, it's all Mickey Mouse stuff. He

08:20.341 --> 08:32.241
said,

08:20.341 --> 08:32.241
these kids don't

08:20.341 --> 08:32.241
like the military. They don't like the 
regimentation. They don't like to go to a place

08:36.648 --> 08:41.376
where they don't grow. Particularly, a place like 
Pratt & Kelly Station, or El Paso, where they can

08:41.396 --> 08:44.982
have some social stuff. where they don't have to 
wear a uniform. They don't want to wear a uniform.

08:49.386 --> 08:53.972
Earl just tore Earl's heart out to say not to wear a 
uniform. But they were so honest. And I really left

08:56.374 --> 09:01.800
there feeling sorry for Earl because they were so 
right. They were so honest and so right. And I think

09:06.045 --> 09:12.893
that was the first time that Earl had been talked to 
like that by somebody that was totally neutral.

09:13.430 --> 09:17.575
And really, trying to do what was best for him. And 
John Younger, you see, he knew as well as those

09:17.595 --> 09:25.665
administrators what was happening. And so I had to 
put John Younger in the

09:25.965 --> 09:32.453
way of what was best. Of course, I told you a little 
bit about John and Jen, which is somewhat the same

09:32.473 --> 09:40.883
for Fort Auburn. They wouldn't keep right along. 
President of the Association and then went on to be

09:43.231 --> 09:57.005
a member of the Board of Directors and was active 
and

09:43.231 --> 09:57.005
strong.

09:59.487 --> 10:10.318
I really, I don't know whether I'm getting older or 
whether I've been away from it longer, but I don't

09:59.487 --> 10:10.318
see the kind of legals in the associations program 
that I remember he had. All right, as a person who's

10:17.358 --> 10:38.749
been away from A&M for 17 years, now back two, I 
agree with you in the events that I've attended

10:17.358 --> 10:38.749
here and elsewhere, I don't see people that I would 
call major league status in the association

10:17.358 --> 10:38.749
leadership like there used to be. That's the 
point. When I left, though, But I lived over there

10:41.416 --> 10:48.386
and I was partially responsible for Buck getting 
that job. And I sat down with Buck and I said, Buck,

10:50.089 --> 11:02.167
let me tell you what I think is the most important 
function that you have. And that function is the

11:02.187 --> 11:09.297
kind of people that you seek out to be your leaders. 
And I said, don't settle for the lower echelon. If

11:17.564 --> 11:23.291
you're going to get somebody from Houston, you got 
a bunch of people that work at a corporation. And if

11:24.853 --> 11:29.058
the president of that corporation is an A&M 
graduate, you get the president. There you go.

11:30.480 --> 11:34.825
Don't you go down below and go to the third level or 
the fourth level. You get the top man. And I said,

11:37.228 --> 11:38.710
number two. don't get a single soul in here that has 
any private agenda. And what we used to say, you get

11:48.367 --> 11:53.653
the guy that's pure in heart. That means his 
heart's pure, he wants to serve, and he wants to

11:54.134 --> 12:01.382
serve because he wants to help the university. 
He's paying back. He's paying back. And I think if

12:04.726 --> 12:08.410
Buck ever thought And I think maybe he faulted in 
that school. And Buck tended to want to get the good

12:14.306 --> 12:25.299
old back-slapping sophomore yell leader who'd 
been to A&M rather than the president of Gulf Hall

12:14.306 --> 12:25.299
of Fame. Now, me personally, if that yell leader 
still a sophomore was president of Texas Power and

12:25.319 --> 12:33.709
Life. That's different. That's different. I take 
it. But if he wasn't. he was named to that board

12:40.250 --> 12:47.258
because he was a good old boy, then I think he made a 
mistake. And I just don't believe that they're

12:47.278 --> 12:52.684
getting into the action. And I know they're all 
younger, but we've got younger guys that are up

12:52.704 --> 12:56.568
there. They just are not getting them. And I don't 
know whether you can say that's Randy's fault or

13:00.473 --> 13:06.780
whether it's a sign of the times. or whether 
there's not that interest out there, but I can't

13:07.604 --> 13:12.011
believe that's not so. I believe there's interest 
there, if you'll just harness it. I went up one time

13:16.158 --> 13:19.804
to Les Potter's office. Les Potter was president 
of Lone Star Gas Company in Dallas. He never been on

13:27.818 --> 13:31.063
my association board.

13:37.490 --> 13:44.561
They are getting the kind of leadership that we did 
back there in the days when the A&M was not quite so

13:37.490 --> 13:44.561
large. I also, in my observer's point of view, feel 
that the Board of Regents, in some instances... I

13:50.930 --> 13:52.453
feel the same way. Now, I think that there's been an 
effort to minimize the part that the alumni play on

14:04.658 --> 14:11.187
the Board of Regents. I fear you're correct. 
That's just like I felt when the accrediting group

14:12.388 --> 14:25.385
from the College of Veterinary Medicine came in 
here and told us we had too many A&M graduates from

14:12.388 --> 14:25.385
the College of Veterinary Medicine. We brought a 
bunch of people down here from the north that

14:25.405 --> 14:29.350
didn't want to work. And as a result, we went 
downhill. Now,

14:36.603 --> 14:42.228
What are

14:36.603 --> 14:42.228
we talking about here? Well, we're talking about 
the people that deserve great credit. Let's pick

14:46.192 --> 14:53.358
up a fellow named Wayne Stark and bring him in and 
the role he played. I can do that. Please. Nobody

14:56.601 --> 15:00.625
else can do it better than I can. Wayne Stark, for 
service that I was, Wayne Stark applied to be

15:05.425 --> 15:13.394
executive secretary of the association when I

15:05.425 --> 15:13.394
applied. Wayne was three years ahead of me, class 
of 39. Wayne had been and was working for Anderson

15:19.922 --> 15:29.593
Clayton Cotton Company out of Houston.

15:30.414 --> 15:31.956
They gave me the job. But about the same time this 
position of Director of the MSC came up. Was it

15:39.738 --> 15:42.201
called that at the time he was appointed? Yes. 
Okay. And he was named Director of the Memorial

15:44.504 --> 15:57.759
Student Center shortly after I was named before 
either one of us reported. We both reported to A&M

15:57.779 --> 16:01.043
on the same day. Oh my. I reported in to McQuillan on 
October the 1st, 1947. Wayne reported in to Angel,

16:07.888 --> 16:12.295
I guess, or whoever had hired him. I think it was 
Angel at the time. On the same day. They gave Wayne a

16:19.085 --> 16:25.956
house on the campus close to where the MSC was 
located. They wouldn't give me a house anywhere

16:27.218 --> 16:34.264
because they were trying to move all those houses 
off the campus.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.307
I was at the groundbreaking. Wayne and I were very 
close. He was doing a lot of the preliminary work

16:41.030 --> 16:46.655
for the MSC before they built it. They broke 
ground, I believe it was on September the 20th of

16:47.335 --> 16:51.759
1948. They broke ground for the MSC. And it took him 
about two years to build. So he had nothing to do

17:00.423 --> 17:04.408
with the physical design of the building? No. That 
was already done? That worked. Well, he got into

17:07.211 --> 17:09.194
the picture later on. Yes, he did. Mr. Carlton 
Adams and Brooks Martin and the fellow that was in

17:10.736 --> 17:26.335
the Aggieland Orchestra, Wally Scott, up in the 
system architect's office, designed the MSC. And

17:26.821 --> 17:32.226
Robert McKee, the company out of El Paso, did the 
work. They built the building. Robert E. McKee.

17:37.051 --> 17:37.852
Robert E. McKee. And they had a big opening of the 
building.

17:47.181 --> 17:53.988
I think it was in July of 19, June or July of 1948. 
They broke it in 1950. And Ms. Park from San

17:57.618 --> 18:02.384
Antonio, I remember, was one of the ladies that 
spoke. She represented, she had a son, I think, who

18:02.424 --> 18:06.789
was killed in World War II. And so she spoke because 
it was a memorial building. But anyway, Wayne's

18:10.814 --> 18:15.620
offices were down at that lower level, far end of 
the building, and I was next door. So we were side by

18:16.701 --> 18:22.528
side, and I was on his first student council. of 
Memorial Student Center Council. I was on its

18:25.873 --> 18:34.344
first council and stayed on that council as long as 
I was working for the association. And Wayne and I

18:34.364 --> 18:42.674
had a lot of sessions together, cried on each 
other's shoulders,

18:34.364 --> 18:42.674
a lot. Wayne was a kind of a fella who wouldn't look 
at the big picture. In other words, to put it more

18:54.740 --> 19:05.811
simply, if elephants were running down the first 
floor, he'd be down in the basement killing piss

18:54.740 --> 19:05.811
ants. Now that was Wayne's way of doing things. 
Pure and hard as he would be, he wanted to do the best

19:08.954 --> 19:14.059
he could. But Wayne was so busy, and I don't want to 
fault him for this, because it was important for

19:14.079 --> 19:22.907
him at the time, particularly important. trying 
to further the artwork, and the cultural things,

19:24.018 --> 19:39.936
and the dramatic things, rather than fundamental 
basics of keeping buildings clean. And as a

19:39.956 --> 19:47.865
result,

19:39.956 --> 19:47.865
Wayne, in some fashion, has got on Earl's shit 
face. And I remember one day, Earl came up. Wayne

19:52.979 --> 19:55.043
came into my office. He had about a five-page 
letter. He said, I want your single space. And he

20:02.416 --> 20:08.587
said, I want you to read this letter before I made it 
to Pearl.

20:08.607 --> 20:12.594
And I said, all right. And I read it. I closed my 
office door, and I read that letter. And most of it

20:16.178 --> 20:26.511
he was complaining to Earl about the fact that some 
of his janitors were not performing quite

20:16.178 --> 20:26.511
properly. And I read that letter and I said, my God, 
I've got to stop this. So the next morning I got a

20:35.082 --> 20:42.591
bill of Wayne to come over and I said, Wayne, first 
thing let me tell you, don't mail this letter. I

20:43.145 --> 20:45.909
said, keep it one day and then burn it up. But don't 
you so show it to anybody else. I said, let me tell

20:48.854 --> 20:51.538
you something. If there's anything in the world at 
this moment that Earl doesn't want to see, it's a

20:51.558 --> 21:01.413
letter from you complaining about some of the 
things that you already take care of first. Don't,

21:02.194 --> 21:06.020
for God's sake, send this letter to Earl. And I 
said, promise me you won't later. And he promised

21:10.126 --> 21:11.228
he wouldn't. And two or three days later, I said,

21:12.828 --> 21:20.478
why didn't you burn that letter? I think he said, 
no. And I said, get it out of your, get it out, you got

21:20.919 --> 21:25.705
it out of your system by writing that letter. Now 
get it out of your file so it don't exist. Then about

21:29.290 --> 21:36.820
a year

21:29.290 --> 21:36.820
later, I had a call from Earl. He said, did you go 
there? The man in the meeting was Wayne Stark in

21:38.866 --> 21:42.990
Beaumont. I said, yes, sir. He said, did Wayne 
badmouth

21:45.813 --> 21:53.360
your name at that meeting? I said, Earl, let me come 
over and talk to you. And I went over and I said,

21:56.403 --> 22:04.671
Wayne didn't mean to badmouth you. He was just 
complaining about some of the things that he felt

22:06.862 --> 22:10.947
was going on. But I said, I don't think he intended 
to make you look bad if he did. And he said, well, he

22:16.072 --> 22:17.414
did. He said, I've had four or five phone calls from 
people who haven't seen me. And I said, well, Wayne

22:22.500 --> 22:31.570
gets carried away on things that he don't have the 
fitness to get carried away on. And Earl told me, he

22:32.849 --> 22:38.975
said, you tell him to attend to his business and run 
a clean operation.

22:40.697 --> 22:41.257
Forget about all that stuff. I said, okay. Did 
anybody encourage Wayne, or was it his own

22:41.558 --> 22:52.008
self-generation, to be the kind of identifier of 
student leadership potential? Because he did it

22:54.210 --> 22:57.614
that well to bring these bright kids in. That was 
Wayne Stevens. Okay. It wasn't anybody else but

22:59.696 --> 23:01.017
Wayne. Wayne, in some way, had the knack, unlike 
Buck, to pick out these kids that were leaders and

23:01.908 --> 23:09.477
did a good job of it. Have you heard any of the 
students refer to the green couch treatment? In

23:15.204 --> 23:15.905
his office? Right. I can imagine. Where he 
lectured to them. Put them on that old green couch

23:17.988 --> 23:19.890
and lectured. You can do better. You've got a lot of 
talent. Oh, yeah. Now go use it. Well, I believe

23:23.515 --> 23:24.656
every bit of it. And he would pick out these kids 
like John Samuels and Fuller and all the rest of

23:25.197 --> 23:30.463
them. Cloud, and all of them. And he was performing 
like a dean of students. Who hired Hannigan? Earl

23:41.329 --> 23:43.152
Rudder brought Hannigan. Earl. Where did he find 
him, do you know? He found him just retired as a

23:45.676 --> 23:47.719
general. Yes. And let's see, he brought him in 
here, I guess as Commandant first, didn't he or

23:48.920 --> 23:54.068
didn't he? I don't know if it was Commandant or 
Dean, but it was He was here when I got here. He was

23:58.438 --> 23:59.599
here when you got here. When did you come? 59. 59. He 
hired Jim Hannigan. He had known Jim Hannigan

24:04.665 --> 24:06.847
during the war. Oh, okay. He was familiar with both 
Doris and Jim. And he brought him here about the

24:13.154 --> 24:21.683
same time he brought John Calhoun and Frank Huber. 
I remember snickering one day in a meeting there'd

24:24.747 --> 24:28.851
been too many non-reg students walking across the 
drill field. And somebody had come up with the idea

24:29.452 --> 24:33.737
to put bailing wire around the trees. And at this 
meeting, Hannigan couldn't figure out where

24:34.518 --> 24:42.967
anybody could have found the pliers needed to cut 
the wire. Cut the wire. And I said, well, you might

24:43.748 --> 24:47.011
look at every pickup on the campus. Every pickup on 
the campus. And he was surprised at that. One thing

24:53.654 --> 24:57.778
about Wayne before I forget. When Wayne and Earl, 
or at least Wayne was not in Earl's best of the

24:57.798 --> 25:07.328
number one good old boys. Wayne went to the 
National Union Building meeting and somebody

25:08.909 --> 25:18.859
offered him a job up in Ohio.

25:18.879 --> 25:21.822
And Wayne came to me. He said, I've been offered 
this job. I'm afraid Earl's going to fire me. And he

25:27.718 --> 25:33.065
said, I don't want to turn down the job if Earl's 
going to fire me. But if he's not going to fire me, I

25:33.085 --> 25:38.451
don't want to leave. And I said, OK, Earl. I mean, 
Wayne, what are you going to do? He said, I want you

25:42.436 --> 25:50.546
to go over and talk to Earl and come back and

25:42.436 --> 25:50.546
tell me what he said. I said, I'll do that. And I 
guess Jerry Haught, somebody up there in the

25:51.417 --> 26:02.990
president's office, I said, I need to see Earl, but 
it won't take you for about five minutes and you can

25:51.417 --> 26:02.990
work me in. She came back and said, he'll see you 
now. I said, I'm on the way. Well, I went inside and I

26:08.776 --> 26:11.700
said, Earl, my mission is for Wayne Star. He said, 
what's Wayne up to now? I said, well... Wayne has

26:15.076 --> 26:24.709
gone to this national meeting of union directors, 
and somebody's offered him a job as a union

26:15.076 --> 26:24.709
director in a college that's somewhere up in Ohio. 
And he thinks you're getting ready to fire him. And

26:33.322 --> 26:37.848
he, if you're gonna terminate him, he wants to take 
this job. But if you're not gonna terminate him, he

26:39.150 --> 26:44.357
wants to stay here, but he'd like to know kind of 
what his position is. And Earl just laughed and

26:45.653 --> 26:56.447
said, well, he said, you go over there and tell

26:45.653 --> 26:56.447
Blaine that I'm not gonna find him. But tell Earl 
from me that I don't want him putting any more naked

26:56.467 --> 27:07.402
women's pictures

26:56.467 --> 27:07.402
in me. So Katie Dale, he'll come over and raise hell 
with me about your naked women. And tell him to keep

27:13.390 --> 27:15.272
the damn place. clean and tell him to approve the 
food. And he just laughed about it. He said, I'm not

27:21.269 --> 27:23.511
going to follow that. Who were the Mr. Rudders, if 
he turned to somebody for advice, he turned to you,

27:23.531 --> 27:30.478
who else did he? He turned to McQuillan. Okay. 
McQuillan kept Earl in A&M when he was a student.

27:39.926 --> 27:42.349
McQuillan went to Mr. Irving Aston in Bryan. Earl 
needed to borrow money. And old McQuillan was such

27:44.868 --> 27:48.832
a scotchman, he could have loaned him all the money 
himself. But he wanted Earl to have the benefit of a

27:48.852 --> 27:52.756
banking relationship. So he called old man Irving 
and asked him, he said, I'm going to send a young man

27:53.717 --> 27:57.621
over to see you. His name is Earl Runner. And he 
said, he needs some money, probably $200. I don't

28:02.827 --> 28:04.248
know what it was. But anyway, he said, I highly 
recommend this boy. And I think he'll pay you back

28:09.493 --> 28:12.917
if you'll run with him. The man asked, Mac told me, 
the old man asked and said, if you'd recommend him,

28:13.403 --> 28:20.509
I'll lend him the money you sent him. So with that 
kind of situation, Earl just thought the world of

28:20.530 --> 28:25.254
Mac. Now Mac was highly instrumental in this 
co-education thing. Very strong. And anyway,

28:31.059 --> 28:38.005
Earl talked to McQuillan. He didn't trust 
Harrington. He didn't trust Shuffler. He didn't

28:44.190 --> 28:46.494
trust Vi Freeman. He didn't trust Angel. And a lot 
of the stuff that he wanted to find out about, he had

28:49.158 --> 28:59.513
asked me to go down there and find out. I said, I'll 
go find out. And when Angel left to go to Arkansas,

29:00.855 --> 29:09.988
that's when Earl won out over this conflict. I had 
talked to Tom Harrington about taking the job as

29:10.981 --> 29:22.135
assistant chancellor that Angel had had. And I 
more or less informed him about the job. I never

29:26.000 --> 29:30.445
heard from Tom again, but Earl found out that I had 
talked to Tom. Earl called me and he said, I want you

29:30.465 --> 29:34.090
in that job. He said, I want you to take it. I said, 
well, I will take it, Earl, if I'm offered the job.

29:41.187 --> 29:42.289
Board of Regents men. And they were talking to Tom 
Harrington about who had applied for the job and

29:44.072 --> 29:50.143
who he was considering. And he mentioned my name. 
And Earl was apparently present at this meeting.

29:55.072 --> 29:57.817
And Earl called me two or three times that weekend. 
That was a Saturday. He said, they're talking

29:59.661 --> 30:02.085
about you for that job. I want you to take it. And I 
said, Earl? I'm ready to take you, but I have to be

30:04.441 --> 30:07.905
offered a job. I have to be offered. I had a call from 
a fellow named Howdy Rideout. He was a member of the

30:11.889 --> 30:14.712
automobile dealership there. And Howdy said, I 
understand you were talking about this job with

30:15.894 --> 30:20.178
Angel. I said, I sure am, Howdy. I applied for the 
job, and a hotel person sent me for the job. He said,

30:27.386 --> 30:29.949
well, the Board of Regents have talked about you. 
They want you in the job. I said, well, all I need is

30:32.116 --> 30:35.921
to be offered the job. Well, time came and went, I 
never got offered the job. Earl called me one day

30:41.409 --> 30:45.615
and said, why the hell didn't you take that job? I 
said, Earl, the reason I didn't take it, I wasn't

30:45.635 --> 30:50.822
offered the job. And then named Bob Cherry. And a 
lot is different because of it. Yeah, yeah. So

30:57.831 --> 30:59.794
anyway.

31:01.732 --> 31:04.777
I just guess that Tom didn't want me up there. I 
think, as a matter of fact, that Tom was a little bit

31:04.797 --> 31:12.849
afraid of the former students.

31:13.810 --> 31:25.047
And by the fact that I knew a lot of people among the 
former students, some of the most powerful ones,

31:13.810 --> 31:25.047
that he just was afraid of being a child. Or maybe he 
thought, I don't know. He never discussed it with

31:27.170 --> 31:28.532
me.
