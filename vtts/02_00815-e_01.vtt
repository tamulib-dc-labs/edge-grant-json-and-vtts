WEBVTT

00:01.364 --> 00:02.866
title, leaving the legislature. 1983

00:02.886 --> 00:09.154
was a turnaround year in many ways. The family had 
been instrumental in starting a bank in College

00:10.435 --> 00:16.783
Station. We had oil and gas revenue on our land out 
in the country. and I was still chairman of the

00:25.799 --> 00:31.984
House Appropriations Committee under a new 
speaker.

00:35.127 --> 00:55.705
I had not given serious consideration to leaving 
the legislature until I was approached by the A&M

00:35.127 --> 00:55.705
System Board of Regents about becoming their 
executive secretary and would be the legislative

00:35.127 --> 00:55.705
liaison to the legislature. The more I thought 
about it, the more sense that it made. I had always

01:01.386 --> 01:13.225
worked in the best interest of the system and 
enjoyed my relationship with the legislature.

01:14.747 --> 01:21.237
There was also the possibility that the oil and gas 
revenue would suddenly dry up. and would again put

01:22.600 --> 01:28.648
finances in a pretty tight situation. In 
addition, I had served five terms as chairman of

01:30.370 --> 01:43.427
the House Appropriations Committee and began to 
grow somewhat weary of the

01:44.892 --> 01:57.228
position as it required a new training program 
each time because there was about a 50% turnover in

01:44.892 --> 01:57.228
membership in the committee each session. 
Committee members that were served on the

01:58.149 --> 02:14.190
Appropriations Committee were often tapped in 
the next session to serve as committee chairman

01:58.149 --> 02:14.190
and were then therefore removed from their 
position as a member of the Appropriations

01:58.149 --> 02:14.190
Committee. Discussions with the Board of Regents 
began in earnest following the regular session of

02:15.014 --> 02:26.353
the legislature in 1983. By late 1983, I had made

02:26.573 --> 02:38.052
a decision to leave the legislature and

02:40.158 --> 02:48.590
accept a position with the Secretary of the Board 
should the Board of Regents choose to elect me. On

02:51.273 --> 02:56.681
or about the first of November, I announced that I 
would not be a candidate for re-election. Later

02:57.783 --> 03:08.157
that month, when the Board of Regents met, they 
tentatively approved my appointment as

02:57.783 --> 03:08.157
Executive Secretary of the Board. It was not 
finally approved until the meeting in January

03:08.491 --> 03:23.935
about

03:08.491 --> 03:23.935
the same date that I assumed the position upon 
resigning from the legislature. It is my

03:25.697 --> 03:36.574
understanding that at the very last minute before 
the board acted upon the minute order in November

03:25.697 --> 03:36.574
that a concession was made to the Chancellor to 
make it a dual position, that is, Executive

03:36.740 --> 03:49.219
Secretary of the Board of Regents and Vice 
Chancellor for State Affairs. By doing it this

03:50.420 --> 04:05.042
way, the Chancellor felt like that I would become a 
part of his staff and he would have more of a role in

03:50.420 --> 04:05.042
legislative affairs. I never viewed it as any 
other way except that the Chancellor would play a

04:05.680 --> 04:25.691
very significant role in legislative affairs and 
could see no reason why the dual role would not work

04:05.680 --> 04:25.691
very well since it would really not change 
anything as far as I was concerned.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.481
Shortly after my appointment it was suggested 
that I have an office in the chancellor's suite,

04:33.237 --> 04:43.671
but I declined and suggested I would prefer not to 
do that. I felt like I could operate more

04:44.492 --> 04:52.022
efficiently out of one office as opposed to two 
offices. During the time I was in the legislature,

04:52.222 --> 05:05.763
I operated out of about three or four offices and 
found it rather inefficient to do so, although

04:52.222 --> 05:05.763
there was nothing that I could be done about that 
arrangement while I was in the legislature. Other

05:07.145 --> 05:20.406
than the one conversation regarding the 
suggestion that I have an office in the

05:07.145 --> 05:20.406
chancellor's suite, the issue never came up again 
until many years later. A resignation effective

05:21.263 --> 05:36.948
on January the 15th, 1984, forced the then 
Governor White to call a special election for my

05:21.263 --> 05:36.948
replacement. At that time, there was a need for a 
special session dealing with public school

05:38.250 --> 05:48.486
finance, sometime during 1984. The election was 
called for during

05:51.568 --> 06:11.813
the spring break of March of 1984 and the fact that 
it was called during the spring break became a

05:51.568 --> 06:11.813
major issue in the campaign. I do not know whether 
the governor had any knowledge of when spring

06:17.305 --> 06:24.515
break was and the fact that the students would be 
out of town. But it certainly made for an issue that

06:24.656 --> 06:35.431
fired up the student body in the general election 
in November later that year. And as a result, it

06:36.352 --> 06:46.587
reversed the election results in November when 
the two candidates squared off for the second

06:36.352 --> 06:46.587
time. 1984 is remembered for some other reasons in 
addition to those already mentioned. Earlier in

06:58.241 --> 07:08.856
1984, there was to be a constitutional election on 
a proposition referred to as Proposition No. 2.

07:10.867 --> 07:23.078
This proposition would restructure the 
permanent university fund and would dedicate

07:10.867 --> 07:23.078
$200 million through the higher education 
assistance fund. The higher education

07:24.920 --> 07:38.832
assistance fund would be funded through general 
revenue appropriations that would be

07:24.920 --> 07:38.832
automatically funded from the top, so to speak, 
each time the legislature met. You will recall

07:39.740 --> 08:06.692
that the schools outside of the Permanent 
University Fund that did not share in the

07:39.740 --> 08:06.692
Permanent University Fund had previously shared 
in the 10-cent ad valorem tax that was assessed

07:39.740 --> 08:06.692
throughout

07:39.740 --> 08:06.692
the state and was about to be ruled 
unconstitutional. The pure passage of

08:08.242 --> 08:15.335
Proposition 2, the Council of Governing Boards 
became very active. The Council of Governing

08:16.337 --> 08:27.778
Boards was made up of the chairman of the governing 
boards of the institutions of higher education

08:16.337 --> 08:27.778
that were state supported. In the case of Texas 
A&M, This would have normally been H.R. Bumbright

08:34.626 --> 08:44.276
of Dallas, but he requested that Mr. Joe 
Richardson of Amarillo serve in his stead on the

08:34.626 --> 08:44.276
board. This was honored, and Mr. Richardson in 
turn asked me to attend all the meetings and become

08:45.757 --> 08:58.330
involved in advising them. with regards to how to 
get Proposition 2 passed. Proposition 2 did pass

09:04.290 --> 09:12.775
in November and become a part of our Constitution, 
thereby making some changes in the Permanent

09:13.868 --> 09:39.623
University Fund by bringing several schools 
under the fund that had not previously been

09:13.868 --> 09:39.623
there and dedicating $200 million to the Higher 
Education Assistance Fund to take care of the

09:13.868 --> 09:39.623
schools that were not covered by the Permanent 
University Fund. Generally speaking, the

09:39.923 --> 09:51.902
Permanent University Fund covered those schools 
that were in the University of Texas system and the

09:39.923 --> 09:51.902
Texas A&M University system. However, we have to 
be very careful to point out that this did not cover

09:52.603 --> 10:06.184
future schools that might come into the system, 
something that we'll talk about later when the

09:52.603 --> 10:06.184
South Texas schools became desires to enter 
either the A&M system or the University of Texas

10:07.143 --> 10:13.051
system. 1984, the state of Texas experienced a 
downturn in its economic situation. This had a

10:23.365 --> 10:32.458
direct impact on the revenues that were to come to 
the state to fund state government. On making

10:34.514 --> 10:48.071
certain projections, Governor Mark White came to 
the conclusion that state agencies would have to

10:34.514 --> 10:48.071
reduce their budgets by some 13% in general 
revenue. Otherwise, the state would be floating

10:48.131 --> 10:55.881
in red ink somewhere in the future, sometime in the 
future. The governor did not have the authority to

10:57.464 --> 11:05.456
force a 13% reduction or any reduction for that 
matter. All he could do was simply ask that it be

11:06.557 --> 11:09.322
done. Only the legislature could have enforced a 
reduction in the budgets of state government. The

11:19.773 --> 11:32.773
records will probably show that most agencies and 
institutions gave up very little and did not reach

11:19.773 --> 11:32.773
the 13% goal that the governor had in mind. For 
example, Texas A&M did better than average by

11:34.195 --> 11:49.037
giving up some 9%, all of this being in reduced 
utility costs, which could not be spent for

11:34.195 --> 11:49.037
anything else the way the appropriations bill is 
written anyway. The elections were adequate

11:52.782 --> 12:10.468
enough, though, to forestall a crisis between the 
time that the governor issued the executive order

11:52.782 --> 12:10.468
and the legislature was back in session in 1985.

12:13.064 --> 12:26.046
Although a crisis was forestalled, another 
crisis was looming for higher education with

12:13.064 --> 12:26.046
regards to state appropriations. Legislative 
Budget Board meets in the fall prior to the session

12:26.066 --> 12:38.987
of the legislature convening and writes a 
proposed budget. And these budget numbers

12:39.727 --> 12:52.344
usually reflect an expenditure of funds that are 
available and allows little room for changes

12:39.727 --> 12:52.344
during the legislative session. In the year of the 
fiscal crisis, it was anticipated that most of the

12:54.287 --> 13:07.185
funds would be spent

12:54.287 --> 13:07.185
prior to the at least in the recommendations of the 
budget board prior to the session beginning.

13:15.557 --> 13:27.557
State agencies generally fared pretty well in the 
recommendations of the budget board until it came

13:15.557 --> 13:27.557
down to making appropriations for higher 
education. When those appropriations were made,

13:28.438 --> 13:30.962
it was required that a 27% reduction be made in 
general revenue for institutions of higher

13:32.782 --> 13:41.996
education. This was a much greater cut than state 
agencies had experienced and was a far greater cut

13:42.496 --> 13:57.118
than reduction in appropriations than any state 
agency or university had ever experienced in

13:57.588 --> 14:02.980
modern times. This sent shockwaves across the 
nation with regards to the terrible plight of

14:04.763 --> 14:17.571
Texas and Texas higher education.

14:21.280 --> 14:32.054
caused me to start reflecting on what might occur 
during the session once the legislature convened

14:21.280 --> 14:32.054
in January of 1985. There were two reasons for the 
27% reduction for higher education on that

14:32.254 --> 14:47.153
fateful day in December 1984 by the Legislative 
Budget Board. First is that it's the last major

14:48.685 --> 14:56.904
article in the appropriations bill to be 
considered. Therefore, it is. necessary that the

15:02.557 --> 15:22.963
recommendations by the staff be a balanced budget 
and any balancing that has to be done has to be done

15:02.557 --> 15:22.963
at the end of the appropriations process by the 
legislative budget board and its staff. Second

15:24.725 --> 15:26.387
and more important Concern and reason is that 84% 
of the budget is mandated either by statute,

15:27.498 --> 15:46.034
federal mandate, or by court order, leaving only 
16% of the budget that is not mandated. 16% is

15:46.054 --> 15:56.863
significant until you consider the fact that 
virtually all of the non-mandated

15:46.054 --> 15:56.863
appropriations is in higher education. To 
compound the of

15:59.752 --> 16:21.999
major concern was the fact that most legislators 
were not aware that such recommendations would be

15:59.752 --> 16:21.999
forthcoming once they convened in Austin and the 
appropriations recommendations were laid out.

16:24.422 --> 16:26.665
This lack of awareness concern to me about as much 
as anything else. When I considered the people

16:31.905 --> 16:46.729
that would be the key players in the 
appropriations process, I could predict as

16:31.905 --> 16:46.729
anyone could who the major players would be in the 
Senate and in the House with the exception of the

16:46.895 --> 17:15.720
person that served as Chairman of Budget and 
Oversight in the House Higher Education

16:46.895 --> 17:15.720
Committee and would serve on the Appropriations 
Committee as a member of the Budget, Chairman of

16:46.895 --> 17:15.720
the Budget and Oversight from Higher Education.

17:18.265 --> 17:26.198
This is the person that you look to to be the one to 
champion higher education.

17:28.562 --> 17:38.278
This became critically important when you 
consider the budget reductions that were going to

17:28.562 --> 17:38.278
be in the recommendations of the budget board. 
When I considered the possibilities whom I could

17:42.413 --> 17:50.802
fill that role since the position would be someone 
new. I

17:50.822 --> 18:11.543
could only come up with one person that had the 
knowledge and the savvy of the legislative

17:50.822 --> 18:11.543
operations and the courage to sit

17:50.822 --> 18:11.543
with the chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee and to stand up to the Speaker and say

18:12.907 --> 18:26.166
that higher education should not be mistreated. 
The next question, and more importantly, was how

18:27.428 --> 18:36.180
we could get the Speaker of the House to make such an 
appointment. It occurred to me that there was one

18:37.578 --> 18:45.109
person that could influence the speaker more than 
anyone else in the whole state of Texas. He

18:46.472 --> 18:56.988
happened to be a graduate of Texas A&M and was a 
close friend of the chancellor of Texas A&M

18:46.472 --> 18:56.988
University's system. So I asked the chancellor if 
he would call this individual. and urge him to

19:04.173 --> 19:18.394
contact the Speaker and urge the Speaker to make 
the appointment of this individual to the

19:04.173 --> 19:18.394
Chairman of Budget and Oversight for Higher 
Education.

19:22.560 --> 19:33.336
The appointment was made by the Speaker, much to 
our delight, and it wasn't until months later that

19:33.940 --> 19:41.587
it was confirmed that the appointment was made 
because of the phone calls that were made.

19:42.929 --> 19:56.702
Confirmed one day about midway in the session when 
the Speaker of the House stopped me in the hallway

19:42.929 --> 19:56.702
and said, you Aggies really play tough. And I knew 
exactly what he had reference to when he made that

19:58.364 --> 20:02.648
statement. He said, I know what happened. And he 
said, I just want you to know you Aggies sure do play

20:05.039 --> 20:08.443
tough. With a champion of higher education in a key 
slot, we were able to restore all but about 9% or 10%

20:10.346 --> 20:31.352
of the budget reductions that had been made by the 
recommended, at least by the Legislative Budget

20:10.346 --> 20:31.352
Board. The restoration of these funds to the 
extent that they were made was

20:33.610 --> 21:03.094
due to the effort of many, but it was very critical 
to have someone sitting on the committee that

20:33.610 --> 21:03.094
could not only relate

20:33.610 --> 21:03.094
to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee 
and the speaker, but was willing to stand up to them

21:04.475 --> 21:08.781
when the time came. Efforts were monumental on the 
part of the chairman of the Board of Regents of the

21:10.503 --> 21:28.689
University of Texas System who held a series of 
meetings in the evenings to rally support and to

21:10.503 --> 21:28.689
tell our story to the members of the legislature. I 
was invited to attend each and every one of those

21:29.750 --> 21:33.115
meetings and They were extremely effective and 
could not have been handled better than the

21:34.867 --> 21:48.163
chairman of the UT Board of Regents was able to 
handle them.

21:52.328 --> 22:00.098
To address the fiscal crisis, one of the 
approaches that was used to try to restore some

22:01.327 --> 22:14.442
physical integrity to higher education was to 
prepare alternative proposals for higher

22:01.327 --> 22:14.442
education.

22:16.902 --> 22:35.168
It became the University of Texas system's role to 
prepare these alternative proposals and take

22:16.902 --> 22:35.168
them to the key people in the legislature that were 
writing the higher education budget and tried to

22:16.902 --> 22:35.168
sell them on the IIDF. This set a pattern for years 
to come of the University of Texas preparing

22:36.690 --> 22:45.863
alternative proposals that would be to deal with 
all of higher education as a package as opposed to

22:46.028 --> 23:02.014
each institution going in and making a plea 
individually with regards to its

22:46.028 --> 23:02.014
appropriations. One of the problems and 
challenges that I always had to deal with when

23:02.935 --> 23:11.108
these proposals came forward before they were 
taken to members of the legislature, was trying to

23:11.645 --> 23:23.779
reconcile the appropriations for our A&M 
services, our agencies. The University of Texas

23:25.301 --> 23:41.280
system did not understand our agencies and were 
not that concerned and had difficulty in

23:25.301 --> 23:41.280
proposing

23:25.301 --> 23:41.280
what I considered a

23:43.268 --> 23:48.655
bare budget for these agencies. Each time we were 
successful in getting the University of Texas

23:48.676 --> 24:06.340
system to reconsider their proposal and add funds 
to the agencies' budgets prior to submitting them

23:48.676 --> 24:06.340
to members of the legislature. There were other 
distractions that we had to deal with in early 1985

24:07.670 --> 24:22.177
when the session of the legislature was well 
underway. It caused great concern. was the

24:28.038 --> 24:48.095
Comptroller of Public Accounts pronouncing that 
higher education had a $2 billion gravy bowl of

24:28.038 --> 24:48.095
funds that it could spend to make up the deficit 
that we contended that would exist if we did not get

24:28.038 --> 24:48.095
more general revenue appropriations. It took 
some time and effort to convince members of the

24:49.476 --> 24:57.943
legislature that the Comptroller was not on 
target in suggesting these funds could be spent in

24:58.430 --> 25:04.239
such a manner. These funds were out of special 
funds, special appropriations, or special

25:05.080 --> 25:24.150
grants that had been made to universities for 
scholarships and for various and other sundry

25:05.080 --> 25:24.150
purposes. programs and could not be diverted to 
general revenue appropriations to take care of

25:24.434 --> 25:32.965
operating budgets of universities. Another 
funding issue was to get implemented the changes

25:35.188 --> 25:49.125
brought about by Proposition 2 that had been made a 
part of the Texas Constitution. There were

25:49.628 --> 25:56.998
several issues that called for additional 
expenditure of general revenue funds in

25:49.628 --> 25:56.998
Proposition 2. First and foremost was a $200 
million appropriation that would go to the

25:58.560 --> 26:13.439
schools outside of the permanent university 
fund, and this was called the Higher Education

25:58.560 --> 26:13.439
Assistance Fund. These funds had to be set aside 
out of the general revenue appropriation's prior

26:19.919 --> 26:25.390
to any operating budgets being allocated funds.

26:28.176 --> 26:38.316
In addition, some other changes that were made in 
Proposition 2 dealt with the allocation of

26:28.176 --> 26:38.316
additional funds to Prairie View. $6 million each 
year for the next 10 years to come from the

26:39.258 --> 26:53.959
University of Texas System's portion of the 
Permanent University Fund, and with A&M

26:39.258 --> 26:53.959
providing an equitable portion. That was in 1985

26:55.522 --> 27:02.532
when it became... first became law as a part of the 
Constitution. And since then, University of

27:07.762 --> 27:15.879
Texas has completed its obligation of providing 
$6 million for 10 years. But to my knowledge, we

27:16.540 --> 27:23.575
still have not clearly defined what is an 
equitable portion for Prairie View. The other

27:25.343 --> 27:30.510
changes that were made was the addition of other 
schools under the permanent university fund. In

27:31.311 --> 27:37.779
the case of the Texas A&M University system, we 
were adding the Texas A&M University at

27:31.311 --> 27:37.779
Galveston. It also made a change with regards to 
allocation of funds to our agencies in the Texas

27:39.602 --> 27:52.178
A&M University system. In the past, the A&M 
agencies had to get legislative approval to sell

27:53.238 --> 28:14.554
bonds and use bond proceeds for construction at 
facilities other than on the A&M campus at College

27:53.238 --> 28:14.554
Station. This proposition changed that where the 
allocation and approval could be made by the A&M

28:16.222 --> 28:26.735
System Board of Regents.

28:32.302 --> 28:40.812
A final change brought about by Proposition 2 in 
1984 was providing access of the system offices of

28:40.977 --> 28:57.577
the Texas A&M University System and the 
University of Texas System to the available

28:40.977 --> 28:57.577
university fund

28:40.977 --> 28:57.577
for their operational expenses. This provision 
in the proposition has obviously led to a decline

29:00.000 --> 29:07.930
in the availability of general revenue 
appropriations by the legislature to the system

29:08.804 --> 29:15.213
offices. Since proposition to system offices of 
A&M and the University of Texas system have

29:16.855 --> 29:28.150
received only a token amount of general revenue 
appropriations from the legislature. Mentioned

29:29.252 --> 29:34.018
before 1985, the legislative session presented 
some very difficult times for higher education

29:35.213 --> 29:53.922
because of the budgetary cuts going into the 
session and coming out of the session with still

29:35.213 --> 29:53.922
about a nine percent reduction in general revenue 
appropriations for higher education. The

29:54.863 --> 30:02.976
actions that was taken by the Texas A&M University 
System Board of Regents to alleviate some of the

30:02.956 --> 30:22.602
problem, particularly on the main campus of Texas 
A&M University, was to refund

30:02.956 --> 30:22.602
most of the bonds that had been previously funded 
at higher rates.

30:25.231 --> 30:33.180
than the interest rates that were prevailing in 
1985 and 1986. Refunding these bonds, about $50

30:34.621 --> 30:47.275
million was freed up for one-time funding by the 
Texas A&M University System Board of Regents. The

30:48.696 --> 30:53.061
regent chiefly responsible for this idea and 
concept was the chairman of the board of regents at

30:54.104 --> 30:59.672
that time, David Eller. Chairman Eller had an 
excellent grasp of bond financing and was able to

31:01.034 --> 31:21.242
walk through with the other regents the 
complexities of refunding the bonds and how this

31:01.034 --> 31:21.242
was advantageous to the Texas A&M University 
system. In 1987, when the legislature convened

31:22.184 --> 31:37.352
that January, the

31:22.184 --> 31:37.352
leadership in the legislature and in the 
governor's office remained the same. Jim Lewis

31:38.835 --> 31:40.217
was still speaker. Bill Hobby was the lieutenant 
governor. Grant Jones chaired the Senate Finance

31:45.353 --> 31:53.067
Committee and Jim Rudd was chairman of the House 
Appropriations Committee.

31:55.751 --> 32:07.632
State Representative Tom Muher was still the 
chairman of Budget and Oversight and sat on the

31:55.751 --> 32:07.632
Appropriations Committee representing higher 
education. There were several issues that arose

32:08.692 --> 32:18.422
during the session that were not contemplated 
prior to the session convening. Early in the

32:20.684 --> 32:29.753
session, I was contacted by State Representative 
Eddie Cavazos, who represented the Corpus

32:20.684 --> 32:29.753
Christi area.

32:32.696 --> 32:37.821
And he advised me that he would like to see Corpus 
Christi state university

32:39.083 --> 32:45.391
become a part of the Texas A&M University system.

32:48.675 --> 33:00.930
I suspect that Representative Cavazos'

32:48.675 --> 33:00.930
ulterior motive was to make Corpus Christi State 
University a four-year institution. At that

33:01.670 --> 33:08.719
time, it was an upper-level institution and had 
only juniors, seniors, and graduate students.

33:09.830 --> 33:37.322
Apparently Representative Cavazos was talking 
to the University of Texas system at the same time

33:09.830 --> 33:37.322
and had been promised through that system's 
chairman of the Board of Regents that he would see

33:09.830 --> 33:37.322
to it that a new institution was created in South 
Texas to alleviate the lack of higher education in

33:38.382 --> 33:44.933
the South Texas area. Cavazos

33:46.035 --> 34:01.622
seemed to like this idea, and I

33:46.035 --> 34:01.622
had little contact with him after the University 
of Texas board chairman intervened. At that time,

34:03.155 --> 34:16.138
the Texas A&M University system was not taking an 
aggressive position with regards to bringing

34:03.155 --> 34:16.138
Corpus Christi State University into the Texas 
A&M University system.

34:19.324 --> 34:28.200
Cavazos introduced a resolution that called for 
the University of Texas to do an interim study to

34:30.003 --> 34:36.369
determine the need for a new university in the 
South Texas area. The resolution, when it reached

34:38.050 --> 34:50.482
the Senate, was handled by the Corpus Christi 
Senator, Carlos Trujan. Senator Trujan, being a

34:50.502 --> 34:59.470
friend personally and a friend of Texas A&M, 
contacted me and suggested that he wish to add the

34:59.922 --> 35:28.950
Texas A&M University System to the resolution

34:59.922 --> 35:28.950
and create a joint committee of the House and 
Senate that would use the resources of the

34:59.922 --> 35:28.950
University of Texas System and the Texas A&M 
University System to make the study to determine

34:59.922 --> 35:28.950
the needs for higher education in South Texas. 
This version passed by the Senate was accepted by

35:31.343 --> 35:50.007
the House and became the final version of the 
resolution creating the joint committee to study

35:31.343 --> 35:50.007
higher education in South Texas. I will have much 
more to say about the interim study at a later time.

36:02.292 --> 36:13.387
but first to complete the issues that were brought 
before the 1987 legislative session. Prior to

36:14.909 --> 36:29.228
1987, a select committee on higher education 
chaired by Mr. Larry Temple, who was a former press

36:14.909 --> 36:29.228
agent for President Johnson, and chairman of the 
Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, had

36:30.642 --> 36:46.700
completed its work and submitted its 
recommendations in the form of a comprehensive

36:30.642 --> 36:46.700
bill that was before the legislature. There were 
several positive aspects with regards to the bill

36:48.061 --> 36:58.573
that the select committee had drawn up and 
introduced in the session that is having a lasting

36:59.836 --> 37:19.566
impact is the drafting of the General 
Appropriations Act in such a way that higher

36:59.836 --> 37:19.566
education is virtually veto-proof. In the past, 
one of the favorite veto items of the governor was

37:28.304 --> 37:35.517
special items in higher education. 1987, with the 
passage of the recommendations of the Select

37:37.361 --> 37:47.680
Committee on Higher Education, these items are 
now veto proof. item that caused some concern

37:48.841 --> 38:03.401
within the Texas A&M University system dealt with 
the handling of indirect costs from federal

37:48.841 --> 38:03.401
projects, primarily research projects. Past 
practice of the legislature in handling indirect

38:04.643 --> 38:18.021
costs through the appropriations process was to 
capture those costs

38:18.355 --> 38:30.773
from universities and bring them into the 
appropriations process. This, in effect, did not

38:31.975 --> 38:48.278
allow the universities to retain any of the 
indirect costs that were received on federal

38:31.975 --> 38:48.278
grants and federal projects. On the other hand, 
the agencies within the Texas A&M University

38:50.182 --> 39:00.958
system were allowed to retain 100% of their 
indirect costs.

39:03.602 --> 39:19.665
That is, they were not captured by the 
appropriations process and freed up those funds

39:03.602 --> 39:19.665
for whatever use the agencies

39:03.602 --> 39:19.665
wished to make. It was advantageous to the 
agencies in two respects. Number one, it meant

39:25.680 --> 39:44.381
that they had more funds to work with, and number 
two, they had more flexibility with the indirect

39:25.680 --> 39:44.381
cost funds than they had with general revenue 
appropriations. The Select Committee on Higher

39:44.401 --> 39:50.007
Education had recommended that universities be 
allowed to retain 50% of the indirect costs on

39:50.678 --> 40:01.647
federal grants. In drafting the bill, however, 
they used the language, quote, institutions of

40:03.529 --> 40:20.263
higher education, close quote, were to retain 50% 
of their indirect costs that they recovered from

40:20.412 --> 40:23.676
federal projects.

40:26.378 --> 40:45.559
I was unable to get the language changed so that our 
state agencies were not included in that

40:26.378 --> 40:45.559
particular definition where the term 
institutions of higher education was used.

40:48.188 --> 41:01.103
In the Senate, however, I was able to prevail upon 
Senator Chad Edwards to change that particular

40:48.188 --> 41:01.103
wording to general academic and health science 
institutions. This clearly excluded the state

41:02.705 --> 41:16.221
agencies at the Texas A&M University system from 
losing 50% of their indirect costs. One of the

41:16.572 --> 41:30.194
concerns was discussing this issue in public view 
because of the misunderstanding that would

41:16.572 --> 41:30.194
likely prevail. When the conference committee 
was deliberating on the bill, I was called back to

41:36.738 --> 41:59.066
the Lieutenant Governor's office in a private 
meeting with three or four people from higher

41:36.738 --> 41:59.066
education, instructed by the Lieutenant 
Governor that the last few issues were to be

41:36.738 --> 41:59.066
resolved before we left the room. As more and more 
of the issues were resolved, members of higher

42:06.083 --> 42:17.120
education began to drift away from the table until 
the only ones left was the representative of the

42:06.083 --> 42:17.120
University of Texas system and myself. We waited 
until that time to explain why we wanted the

42:18.883 --> 42:28.378
language to read general academic and health 
science institutions. at the University of Texas

42:29.810 --> 42:52.662
System representatives to agree to use that 
language and as a result we never had to explain it

42:29.810 --> 42:52.662
to the legislature as a whole or to even individual 
members of the legislature other than Senator

42:29.810 --> 42:52.662
Edwards. Discussed it with the sponsor in the 
house but was unable to prevail upon him to make the

42:54.802 --> 43:22.024
change and for that reason we found ourselves in 
conference committee with the house version

42:54.802 --> 43:22.024
relating to 50% retention of indirect costs for 
institutions of higher education which would

42:54.802 --> 43:22.024
include the A&M agencies or services, the Senate 
version being silent with regards to the A&M

43:22.375 --> 43:37.977
services or agencies, which was the preferred 
language as far as the A&M system was concerned.

43:40.080 --> 43:50.374
Our strategy of avoiding making it a public issue 
with regards to the A&M services I think has paid

43:50.523 --> 43:52.706
great dividends over the years. A final issue that 
the 1987 regular session of the Texas legislature

43:54.448 --> 44:16.834
dealt

43:54.448 --> 44:16.834
with was

43:54.448 --> 44:16.834
related to the Texas A&M University at Galveston. 
This was a bill introduced by Senator Chet Brooks,

44:17.438 --> 44:28.436
who was a ranking senator and on the conference 
committee of the General Appropriations Act. At

44:29.377 --> 44:34.806
the time, the bill was moving through the 
legislature.

44:36.946 --> 45:06.210
Although I was never told this, I'm sure that the 
bill was introduced by Senator Brooks at the

44:36.946 --> 45:06.210
request of the president of Texas A&M University 
at Galveston,

44:36.946 --> 45:06.210
who had a reputation of bypassing the system 
office and the Board of Regents when he wished to

44:36.946 --> 45:06.210
accomplish something through the legislature. 
Fortunately, once Senator Brooks had filed the

45:07.169 --> 45:24.654
bill in the Senate, I got a call from his office 
requesting that I come by and look over the bill and

45:07.169 --> 45:24.654
see if I had any changes that I wished to make. Since 
the bill had been filed, this meant that a complete

45:26.056 --> 45:35.910
substitute would be written

45:37.156 --> 45:44.533
and taken to committee, Senate committee, if 
there were any changes that needed to be made. The

45:46.237 --> 45:56.160
bill as drawn, in my opinion, would have taken 
Texas A&M University Galveston from under the

45:46.237 --> 45:56.160
control of Texas A&M University. As Secretary of 
the Board of Regents, I was aware of the fact that

45:57.929 --> 46:09.805
the Board did not want to see that happen, and if 
anything, wanted to bring it more under control of

45:57.929 --> 46:09.805
Texas A&M University. I seriously doubted that 
the bill would pass, since it was introduced very

46:12.108 --> 46:22.722
late in the session, but we did not want to take any 
chances.

46:23.917 --> 46:46.970
I was allowed to rewrite the bill in such a way that 
it came even more under control of Texas A&M

46:23.917 --> 46:46.970
University and was able to also consult with the 
president-to-be of Texas A&M University,

46:23.917 --> 46:46.970
Galveston, who at the time was living in 
Washington, D.C. It was not surprising because of

46:48.312 --> 46:52.017
the seniority of Senator Brooks that the bill 
passed in the Senate.

46:59.219 --> 47:16.198
Surprising, however, that the

46:59.219 --> 47:16.198
state representative representing the 
Galveston area was able to pass it in the House very

46:59.219 --> 47:16.198
quickly and the bill became law.
