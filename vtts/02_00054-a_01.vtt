A, B, A, B, testing, A, B. Testing, C, D, C, D, C, D. Testing, C, D, testing.

00:12.412 --> 00:14.356
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

00:14.937 --> 00:16.099
Testing, one, two, three.

00:16.788 --> 00:20.593
This is Thursday, January 24th, I believe it is.

00:21.634 --> 00:30.925
And I have the pleasure and honor of recording the student memories of Frank Cox, class of... 65.

00:30.945 --> 00:31.306
65.

00:31.326 --> 00:31.927
1965.

00:31.967 --> 00:42.880
Frank, to begin with, to introduce yourself to anyone that might hear this tape or read the transcription, describe family background going up,

00:43.163 --> 00:46.427
What did family do and where and so forth?

00:46.527 --> 00:50.252
Well, I grew up in a small town in northeast Texas, New Boston.

00:50.312 --> 01:00.004
It's the county seat of Bowie County, right in the four states area of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, and a town of about 2,000.

01:00.024 --> 01:06.413
And my parents, nobody in my family had ever been to college, and I was the first one to ever even think about it.

01:06.673 --> 01:09.897
My senior year in high school, of course, I was active.

01:10.484 --> 01:19.031
most sports and baseball and basketball especially and loved sports and never had much background with the military, thought much about it.

01:19.071 --> 01:27.279
My dad served in World War II in the Philippines and Okinawa, but other than that, didn't really have much background.

01:27.319 --> 01:40.390
But Randy Wortham, who was a class of 59 at Texas A&M, was a few years ahead of me at New Boston and a great guy and played on the baseball team

01:40.792 --> 01:43.115
So I came down to watch him play one weekend.

01:43.135 --> 01:47.901
That was my first exposure and about my only exposure to Texas A&M.

01:47.981 --> 01:57.513
I had been to Boise State my junior year in high school and so I saw the University of Texas which I later came to realize was really TU.

01:57.733 --> 02:10.309
And really at that time didn't have any loyalty to either one and could just as easily have gone to TU in all honesty because I love baseball so much and they had such a great baseball program and I wanted to play

02:10.778 --> 02:13.541
shortstop for a Southwest Conference.

02:13.561 --> 02:19.466
So my dad was just never made more than $5 an hour his whole life.

02:19.506 --> 02:20.767
What did he do for a living?

02:20.787 --> 02:21.828
He did several things.

02:21.888 --> 02:27.453
He was a traveling salesman for a lumber company and steel company in the Four States area for years.

02:27.493 --> 02:31.297
Sold forwards and he was a district clerk for Bowie County for a few years.

02:32.678 --> 02:33.819
That's mostly his background.

02:33.839 --> 02:34.720
He grew up in Tennessee.

02:34.740 --> 02:39.064
And my mother worked for 50 years in the same place in New Boston at the

02:39.348 --> 02:42.832
First National Bank as the head cashier, 50 years.

02:43.993 --> 02:45.074
No brothers or sisters.

02:46.776 --> 02:48.498
You partly refer to this.

02:49.419 --> 02:53.504
Why did you attend A&M and then you came to visit?

02:53.624 --> 02:54.865
What impression did it make?

02:55.165 --> 02:57.328
What were the factors that caused you to come down here?

02:57.348 --> 03:09.321
I would really have to say with a background in sports and loving the camaraderie of working together with other people and I had an active background in church and just love the family feeling.

03:09.807 --> 03:12.350
that A&M exhibited when I came here.

03:12.390 --> 03:23.943
Didn't know much about politics or being a conservative or liberal, probably never even heard those terms in all honesty, but had that basic foundation and the ground level of what family was about.

03:23.983 --> 03:37.418
And I love that spirit and knowing that I wasn't good enough to play athletics in college, that something like the Court of Cadets would be the closest thing that I could find or come to as far as having that same

03:38.039 --> 03:41.564
feeling of camaraderie and oneness and teamwork.

03:42.045 --> 03:44.749
Now you came only once before you came down to enroll?

03:45.030 --> 03:45.590
Yes, sir.

03:45.791 --> 03:47.273
I just had one time.

03:49.216 --> 03:51.579
What kind of arrangements did you make?

03:51.660 --> 03:55.025
When did you formally apply for admission and all that?

03:55.045 --> 03:55.566
Do you remember?

03:55.706 --> 04:05.160
It was, in fact, that's really my wife, before we moved to College Station six months ago, worked for the New Boston Independent School District.

04:05.714 --> 04:22.954
and had access to the records and she looked back at my counseling record when I was a senior in high school and asking, this was during the latter months of my senior year and I still had not decided where I was going to go in all honesty and it was down to those two schools, Texas A&M or down to Austin.

04:24.296 --> 04:30.523
So it was almost just at the end of my senior years when I finally made that decision

04:31.128 --> 04:32.731
And I'm so thankful that I did.

04:32.751 --> 04:33.432
What a difference.

04:33.472 --> 04:36.076
I didn't know it at the time, but I've found out since.

04:36.096 --> 04:41.525
When you came down then to enroll, describe who brought you and what you had.

04:41.845 --> 04:44.069
My mom and dad didn't have any vehicles.

04:44.129 --> 04:45.070
I didn't have a car.

04:45.130 --> 04:49.858
Most of my buddies in the outfits didn't have a car during that time.

04:49.938 --> 04:55.767
And my parents dropped me off in front of dorm six and left.

04:55.867 --> 04:58.772
And, of course, I never had been away from home very much.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.882
What did you bring with you?

05:00.962 --> 05:03.085
What kind of stuff in your footlocker?

05:03.726 --> 05:06.069
Oh, just the basics, whatever they told me to.

05:06.089 --> 05:10.155
I can't really remember much, but it all fit in the footlocker, I'll tell you that.

05:10.756 --> 05:21.611
And I know my Bible and just the basic clothing that whatever they told me to bring, which wasn't much, and maybe a lamp, steady lamp.

05:21.631 --> 05:23.614
That's all that I really remember.

05:23.634 --> 05:28.641
And did Mom or Dad or anybody else give you any final advice?

05:29.414 --> 05:33.018
as you were getting ready to get out of the car or anything like that?

05:33.598 --> 05:55.242
Well, my dad was a great man as well as my mother and just basically had always taught me the importance of always treating people fairly and just being honest and all the ethical aspects of behaviors that you usually grow up with in a small town and especially if you're involved in the Christian life.

05:56.263 --> 05:59.286
And just told me to keep on keeping on

05:59.452 --> 06:04.418
not to turn away from those basic morals and standards that I'd grown up with.

06:05.139 --> 06:11.106
Did he give you any reason to be sure not to drop out and come home?

06:12.988 --> 06:19.395
Well, just the battle that he always kept his homies did that he used several times in my growing up days.

06:19.455 --> 06:22.759
Back in those days, they didn't have such a thing as time out.

06:22.779 --> 06:25.122
It was knock out more than time out.

06:25.237 --> 06:28.423
So never much threats.

06:28.483 --> 06:35.858
He really wanted, he was, didn't have much education himself and he always appreciated that probably more than I did at the time.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.884
I didn't realize the importance of it as much as he did.

06:38.944 --> 06:43.232
And I wasn't all that mature as a freshman in all honesty.

06:43.252 --> 06:47.380
It was just kind of a day-by-day, moment-by-moment existence at that time

06:47.731 --> 06:52.255
plans of what I was going to be doing four years from now or what I always wanted to be.

06:52.295 --> 06:56.560
It was just... All right, so they dropped you off.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.422
They dropped me off, drove off.

06:58.522 --> 07:06.109
I walked into dorm six, scared to death because being from a small town, nobody had ever chewed me out or talked to me the way I was getting ready to be talked to.

07:06.209 --> 07:13.356
And I walk in and the sophomores just swarm you and I was really scared.

07:13.396 --> 07:14.998
I didn't even unpack for two weeks.

07:15.098 --> 07:16.219
I was stuck in a room

07:16.756 --> 07:29.208
dorm six, room 106 and it was three bunks high and I had the top bunk and about a foot and a half from the ceiling was about all the room that I had.

07:29.288 --> 07:32.150
Now how did you get assigned to that outfit, do you know?

07:33.292 --> 07:43.061
I had, again, I was so ignorant of the situation at A&M and the Corps much even, didn't have any background about the different outfits and it was just assigned to me.

07:43.121 --> 07:44.502
I did not know anybody and

07:44.920 --> 07:49.467
in Squadron II, which was the outfit that I was assigned to, Gator II, easy come, easy go.

07:49.547 --> 08:01.387
It was just by chance, but what a, I considered it by chance, but what a great chance because I developed the greatest friends I've ever had during my time there with.

08:01.407 --> 08:05.113
Describe then the first day or two.

08:06.034 --> 08:07.096
How did they get you?

08:07.116 --> 08:11.603
Well, I had never marched in my life and,

08:11.954 --> 08:17.420
or been in the military, I was good about keeping rooms clean, but not to the degree that they expected you to.

08:17.440 --> 08:29.413
And some of my buddies were already quitting and leaving, and here I was five hours from home, 250 miles without a car, no way to get back except hitchhike, which I did several times back in those days.

08:29.493 --> 08:41.286
But I think just the thing that was so different to me was the way that the sophomores had of making you feel about an inch high

08:41.570 --> 08:45.795
worst cadet that they had ever seen at Texas A&M and made you believe it.

08:45.815 --> 08:56.929
So going to chow, going to the mess hall, the dunking over in the quad, that was the toughest experience I think is trying to eat in the mess hall.

08:56.949 --> 09:04.338
That was the toughest times when they asked you all the questions and the cush questions and I usually didn't know them.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.701
And the marching, I couldn't tell the difference they were saying.

09:07.382 --> 09:10.446
Left foot down, hit that left foot down on up and every,

09:10.814 --> 09:12.796
sound out of their mouth sounded like it.

09:12.816 --> 09:14.678
It was, uh, two, three, four, uh, uh.

09:15.239 --> 09:16.621
And so I was, uh.

09:16.641 --> 09:20.164
Now when did all, when did that kind of instructions begin?

09:20.465 --> 09:23.108
Well, from the very first day, as far as I remember.

09:23.128 --> 09:25.250
I mean, they were right on you from the very beginning.

09:25.350 --> 09:28.394
You were, they started the training aspect of it.

09:28.414 --> 09:30.816
They didn't get any time to ease into it.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.659
It was, it was almost as if they expected.

09:32.679 --> 09:34.881
This is the fall of 1960.

09:36.194 --> 09:36.575
What?

09:37.016 --> 09:37.176
61.

09:37.196 --> 09:37.978
61.

09:37.998 --> 09:39.040
Yes, sir.

09:39.741 --> 09:43.149
In fact, it was at a time Hurricane Carlo.

09:43.169 --> 09:56.717
Carlo had hit the campus and hit Texas, and so there we were with a tremendous, terrible storm that came all the way up to College Station, and we experienced that in addition to the

09:57.136 --> 10:01.021
hurricane atmosphere of the sophomores in our album.

10:01.041 --> 10:05.007
Do you remember any particular damage on the campus from the hurricane?

10:05.027 --> 10:05.628
I do not.

10:05.788 --> 10:06.329
I'm sorry.

10:06.369 --> 10:06.950
I just don't.

10:06.990 --> 10:07.590
I don't either.

10:07.610 --> 10:10.174
I just remember a lot of wind.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.095
Yes, yes.

10:11.736 --> 10:15.081
And rain and just made it much more miserable.

10:16.162 --> 10:18.986
What was your first impression of the campus as you walked around?

10:20.488 --> 10:25.455
Well, I always loved the campus and again, I liked the

10:26.060 --> 10:28.743
the small town type atmosphere.

10:30.345 --> 10:33.128
I don't know that I noticed so much the buildings.

10:33.208 --> 10:38.834
I wasn't into noticing buildings or architecture or the style or anything of that nature much then.

10:38.915 --> 10:43.780
It was some of the tallest buildings I'd ever seen, though, even though they weren't very tall back in those days.

10:43.860 --> 10:46.603
It was taller than we had in New Boston, so it seemed big.

10:46.623 --> 10:49.907
All right, now, in your growing up years, you all went to Texarkana.

10:50.562 --> 10:53.085
if we wanted to go shopping or something.

10:53.125 --> 10:54.987
And we had a little theater there in New Boston.

10:55.007 --> 11:14.027
Back in those days, small towns, had a drive-in theater, had a movie theater, the Walkia, that I could go to for nine cents on a Saturday and see a major movie and a double feature and cereal and a couple of cartoons and newsreels and stay there all day for 14 cents.

11:14.067 --> 11:16.570
You could even get a pickle or some popcorn.

11:16.685 --> 11:20.008
But I presume you didn't go to Dallas, Shreveport, Little Rock very often.

11:20.029 --> 11:21.170
No, very, very seldom.

11:21.850 --> 11:26.055
My parents and me, it had to be almost like a vacation if we went to Dallas.

11:26.155 --> 11:29.238
Actually, I had polio when I was six.

11:29.579 --> 11:39.789
And so I went to Warm Springs, Georgia, which was the polio foundation where President Franklin Roosevelt actually went when he had polio.

11:39.809 --> 11:42.692
And so that was the only traveling we had ever done out of Bowie County.

11:42.712 --> 11:44.674
It's when they would take me and leave me there.

11:44.754 --> 11:46.236
My mother stayed with me.

11:46.469 --> 11:47.631
had to come back and work.

11:47.691 --> 11:49.893
And I was there at Warm Springs for several months.

11:50.855 --> 11:55.401
And had to go back every six months for several years till I was 16.

11:55.501 --> 11:59.506
So my dad and mom would almost make a little vacation out of that.

11:59.646 --> 12:04.232
And that was the only time, that was my exposure to some of the rest of the South mostly.

12:04.312 --> 12:09.339
And when you came here, did the polio have any effect?

12:09.359 --> 12:13.384
Well, I was very fortunate and blessed to, it really didn't affect me.

12:13.404 --> 12:15.447
I played sports all through high school.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.505
and had what most people would consider a pretty complete recovery.

12:20.547 --> 12:22.049
And so it did not affect.

12:22.110 --> 12:24.633
I played intramurals and went out for the baseball team.

12:24.653 --> 12:30.983
And I was 5'6 and weighed about 112 pounds as a freshman.

12:31.785 --> 12:39.156
And so I did not make the baseball team, but played intramurals and all those activities and loved that.

12:39.423 --> 12:46.053
As you're becoming part of this outfit, what did the sophomores and the other upperclassmen tell you was special about that outfit?

12:47.235 --> 12:53.304
Well, just like all the others I found out later, but I was convinced that we definitely had the best outfit on campus.

12:53.405 --> 13:00.315
And we probably, in my thinking, we were.

13:00.335 --> 13:01.337
We were.

13:02.439 --> 13:04.722
Were you all concentrated in any major activities?

13:05.107 --> 13:06.068
engineering or?

13:06.168 --> 13:06.989
Mostly business.

13:07.129 --> 13:12.235
Most of our upper classroom were business majors, accounting, marketing.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.117
What did you think your major was going to be?

13:14.137 --> 13:25.569
I started out in accounting because I loved math in high school, but finally realized pretty quickly that I wouldn't like sitting at a desk all day long with figures and changed it to personnel management.

13:25.869 --> 13:28.191
And what dorm were you all in?

13:28.492 --> 13:30.574
Dorm six, first floor.

13:31.162 --> 13:33.164
First and second floor actually our outfit.

13:33.885 --> 13:38.028
We didn't have lounges back then like they do now to the degree they do.

13:38.549 --> 13:44.855
All right, those first few days and nights, you're here before classes begin?

13:44.915 --> 13:45.756
Yes, sir.

13:46.616 --> 13:47.857
Yes, sir, a little while.

13:47.877 --> 13:48.918
I can't remember how long.

13:48.938 --> 13:51.321
I remember we were here before kind of like they have now.

13:51.501 --> 13:56.125
I don't believe they call it Fish Orientation Week like they do now, F-O-W.

13:56.165 --> 13:59.228
I don't remember that term, but it was probably similar to that.

13:59.528 --> 14:04.053
because we were there a few days before most of the upperclassmen came.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.777
And how did that change things?

14:06.797 --> 14:08.539
Well, that was a shock, of course.

14:09.039 --> 14:19.892
You know, they were even worse than the ones that were there the first few days because they were chomping at the bits to lay on us what had been laid on them the year before.

14:19.973 --> 14:27.882
And so I guess it was all college night is one of my first memories also when Rita Rainer, I can remember we,

14:28.402 --> 14:29.523
No, not Reed.

14:30.665 --> 14:31.145
You said Reed.

14:31.165 --> 14:31.606
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:32.066 --> 14:33.007
Yeah, Holly, I'm sorry.

14:33.047 --> 14:33.548
G. Raleigh?

14:33.728 --> 14:34.309
G. Raleigh.

14:34.869 --> 14:35.450
G. Raleigh.

14:36.431 --> 14:46.242
And we were all, all the fish were sitting on the west side of the arena and all khaki-clad, burr-headed, all looked basically alike, scared to death.

14:46.382 --> 14:56.113
And it was the night when they introduced the football team and the coaches and we were supposed to remember all their names and their numbers and their weight and their position and their height and where they were from.

14:56.684 --> 15:05.634
And I'll never forget the head yell eater, Jim Davis, ran and jumped up on the stage and pointed out at the audience over with us fish.

15:05.654 --> 15:08.438
And I could have sworn he was pointing right at me.

15:08.458 --> 15:11.461
And he said, you ain't going to make it.

15:12.923 --> 15:15.746
I know I was thinking to myself, I'd just been there a few days.

15:15.846 --> 15:17.548
And I said, it is true.

15:17.608 --> 15:18.850
Seniors do know everything.

15:18.970 --> 15:25.898
And then he said, I want you to look at the men on your right and the men on your left because they ain't going to be here at the end of the year.

15:26.637 --> 15:31.043
So I kind of glanced over to my right and there was fish Johnny Bickham from Van Vleck, Texas.

15:31.664 --> 15:36.811
And I glanced at my left and there was fish Herb Pounds from Gonzales, Texas.

15:36.831 --> 15:40.636
And I said to myself, I don't know about them, but I can tell you this.

15:41.397 --> 15:44.161
I ain't even going to be here at the end of the week until it's the end of the year.

15:44.261 --> 15:47.906
But thankfully I was able to make it through it.

15:48.046 --> 15:49.408
Did both of them?

15:49.749 --> 15:50.510
They sure did.

15:50.610 --> 15:51.491
So all three of you?

15:51.651 --> 15:52.953
We sure did.

15:53.013 --> 15:54.155
Great guys.

15:54.475 --> 15:55.176
We started out with

15:55.983 --> 15:57.525
We were the class of 65.

15:57.805 --> 15:58.947
We started out with about 65.

15:59.728 --> 16:06.557
We wound up about 37 the end of our fish year, and less than that, every year some more would drop out.

16:07.038 --> 16:07.278
All right.

16:07.638 --> 16:13.546
Describe how you and your new old lady accommodated yourselves to a room.

16:13.606 --> 16:22.598
Well, we started out three, like I say, to a room that was really made for two, and it wasn't long, though, before

16:23.185 --> 16:32.116
Guys would start falling out and going home and quitting and opening up a few spaces, you know, and just learning how to keep your room.

16:33.458 --> 16:44.311
There was always something that you thought you had to just ride, and they would always come up with something new every time that you hadn't thought of before as to where to look for dust or something of that nature.

16:44.772 --> 16:45.753
Who was your old lady?

16:46.454 --> 16:49.538
Well, I had several of my fish here.

16:49.558 --> 16:52.922
It actually started out, like I say, because of the

16:53.290 --> 17:00.119
those that were dropping out so rapidly, but one was Zelna Buford Moore.

17:01.080 --> 17:01.902
Zelna.

17:01.922 --> 17:10.473
I had never heard that name in my life, and he was from Corsicana, and 1961 was the last time I've seen him.

17:10.493 --> 17:21.728
I've talked to people from Corsicana that know him, but he left, didn't make it through, but had a fish, Bill Music, also from Galveston, Texas, that

17:22.113 --> 17:30.203
made it a couple of years and then dropped out, but Bill Music and... Describe that first semester, describe that fish room, that room.

17:30.243 --> 17:48.424
Well, it was the room, the things I remember about it now that's pretty much different from, even though it's the same dorms that they live in now in the Quad, the major differences, I would say, is we had piping, pipes that ran through

17:50.311 --> 18:19.525
ceiling that you that were visible probably a foot and a half from the top of the ceiling by the window and we were always hanging from those pipes and by our legs or our hands and and just anything different because we wanted to stay in that room and just had one sink and a couple of beds a couple of desks and that was about it of course no air conditioning probably a 60 watt bulb in the now was this was this a double-decker bunk or

18:19.657 --> 18:20.678
It was double-decker.

18:21.399 --> 18:22.441
In fact, it was three.

18:22.801 --> 18:34.216
Starting out, it was three high, and that's why I was the smallest one, and I was on top bunk, and you'd raise up in the middle of the night if somebody would holler and hit your head on the ceiling.

18:34.316 --> 18:37.620
Now, who decided, who got, who made that decision?

18:37.700 --> 18:38.662
How did you get to be?

18:39.503 --> 18:48.955
Well, I was, probably, I probably volunteered, because knowing me, again, from a small town, and just going that extra mile and trying to help others, and

18:49.441 --> 18:51.783
not being too confrontational or demanding.

18:53.805 --> 18:55.487
I was usually just willing to do.

18:55.527 --> 18:56.888
It didn't matter to me.

18:57.068 --> 18:58.730
I'd seen worse.

18:58.810 --> 19:03.054
Describe what happened in the hallways those first nights as they tried to.

19:03.074 --> 19:09.781
Of course, one of the toughest things was out in the hallway when they had you lined up on both sides of the wall all the way down.

19:09.801 --> 19:17.668
The outfits then were so big and twice as big as they are now, I would say, for the most part, for most of the outfits.

19:17.688 --> 19:19.330
And so you were lined up with,

19:19.664 --> 19:49.013
nothing but fish on both sides of the hallway from one end to the other just about, and all that attention flat up against the wall, and here they are walking down the upperclassmen, chewing you out, and you're just looking straight across at the person across from you, and of course they're never supposed to smile or laugh or anything, and they'd call it, wipe that buzz off your face, and I had a tendency, I'm just pretty much of a happy-go-lucky guy, and so I was kind of,

19:50.765 --> 19:53.108
in trouble most of the time for buzzing a lot.

19:53.148 --> 20:18.004
In fact, Fish Pounds again from Gonzales, he would stand right across from me many times and he had eyebrows about an inch thick and they would be chewing on me and I'd be looking at Pounds and he'd start rolling those eyebrows up and down and I would crack up laughing at him and of course get me in trouble and we'd have to have our head about an inch, inch and a half away from the wall

20:18.592 --> 20:26.465
when we did that and they would make us slap our forehead which would knock our head back into the wall to wipe that buzz off our face.

20:26.565 --> 20:30.151
So that's the way they taught us to not smile.

20:30.351 --> 20:32.414
How soon did the paddle get used?

20:34.959 --> 20:38.144
I would say it wasn't right off the bat that I remember.

20:39.987 --> 20:43.873
I would say that that came a little bit later on after they saw the ones who

20:44.123 --> 21:00.577
were really gonna stick it out, the ones who they considered to be the, they were gonna make it and understood what the training was for and the purpose of it and what the kind that was gonna squeal on anyone for doing something like that because we didn't really see anything wrong with it in all honesty.

21:01.158 --> 21:02.119
It was never vicious.

21:02.259 --> 21:11.727
I was whipped with brooms and clothes hangers and paddles and rifle butts, you know, but it, not as bad as it sounds really.

21:11.807 --> 21:13.168
I don't remember any,

21:13.908 --> 21:15.009
damage or anything.

21:15.030 --> 21:18.915
I mean, it hurt, yeah, but they'd get you about an inch from the wall.

21:18.935 --> 21:28.728
As far as the clothes hanger, they wouldn't swing it at you, but they'd get you about an inch from the wall, your rear end, and then they'd get that clothes hanger, straighten it out, and run it down that wall.

21:29.189 --> 21:35.837
And, of course, it was just vibrating all the way down the wall and just leaving whelps on you all the way down, basically, is the way that worked.

21:35.958 --> 21:41.705
But, you know, we really did not consider that hazing, in all honesty.

21:42.206 --> 21:42.987
In fact, there were

21:44.468 --> 22:04.435
17 of us, at the end of the year, we were put on probation because the bulls from the Trigon found out about it, and some of the upperclassmen also had to sign in, but the next year, coming back, there were 17 of us had to sign in, every hour on the hour, every week,

22:04.668 --> 22:11.699
weekend in a Class A uniform to Corps headquarters because we allowed them to whip us.

22:11.719 --> 22:14.743
And it was against the rules, you know, or whatever.

22:14.803 --> 22:16.326
I didn't know whose rules they were against.

22:16.346 --> 22:22.615
They just said, bend over, and that's what we did, you know, and didn't think anything about it.

22:23.376 --> 22:31.789
But anyway, they found out about it, and we had to sign in all the way up through, I believe it was

22:32.275 --> 22:35.218
November, up close to Turkey Day ball game.

22:35.398 --> 22:38.461
Now, how did you get your clothing, your stuff?

22:40.063 --> 22:41.664
Where'd y'all go check it out?

22:43.526 --> 22:45.248
It was up close to Dunkin'.

22:45.969 --> 22:48.611
In that area, it seems to me like there was an area up there.

22:48.711 --> 22:55.778
And again, I apologize for not having such great memory of some of these events, exact location.

22:55.798 --> 23:01.624
Most of the time I was looking at the back of the neck of the guy in front of me and not even looking around.

23:02.043 --> 23:05.526
I just pretty much did what they told me and that's look straight ahead.

23:07.388 --> 23:18.098
But it was up in that area and I remember we had a laundry that we had to turn in in our duffel bags and go pick up our starched uniforms when they were ready.

23:18.139 --> 23:23.564
And when you were issued these, were these new articles of clothing or some of them used?

23:24.325 --> 23:26.687
Some of them I'm almost sure were used.

23:27.107 --> 23:31.071
Yes, I'm sure that they were used in the head gear and the rain gear.

23:31.355 --> 23:43.131
The khakis, we didn't have serge in those days as far as the underclassmen, and so the creases and all in the uniform didn't last all that long, and then you learned how to iron real quick.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.114
Did they fit, fit fairly well?

23:46.135 --> 23:49.820
You know, yes, pretty, pretty much, you know.

23:49.900 --> 24:00.214
You learned not to have high water pants and things of that nature, but they, they were, and usually for many hours this time went by during that first year, they got a little tighter as,

24:00.616 --> 24:03.641
Where'd you get the fish haircuts?

24:04.402 --> 24:04.822
Do you remember?

24:05.483 --> 24:07.106
It was in MSC.

24:07.166 --> 24:09.870
It's where I got most of my haircuts the whole time I was there.

24:09.930 --> 24:13.836
And they'd just march it over the MSC and just buzz it right off.

24:13.936 --> 24:19.064
And, of course, most of us in those days had flat tops to begin with.

24:19.084 --> 24:22.268
It wasn't as if most of us were getting too much cut off.

24:22.288 --> 24:23.350
But there were some guys with

24:23.667 --> 24:27.771
DuckTales, because that was kind of the fad, too, back in the early 60s.

24:27.971 --> 24:34.417
All right, as you, do you remember, did you all register for classes the first semester, or did you get your classes?

24:35.298 --> 24:41.083
Yes, we had, the main thing I remember about that aspect of it, of course, there weren't any computers or anything like that.

24:41.103 --> 24:51.092
We just stood in long lines, is what I remember, it was a base of, long lines, and you'd wait in line to finally get up there, and right when you got there, they'd say, well, that just filled up, you know,

24:51.629 --> 25:05.090
course you really need it or the time you really need it and so here you go again, have to go stand in another line and go through the same routine until you could get enough hours and one of the differences back then is most of us took 18 hours at least.

25:05.872 --> 25:14.746
Some of these guys and gals today I understand, they might take 12, you know, which is really amazing to me but that shows they're smarter than us.

25:14.806 --> 25:17.991
That keeps them around for about six years instead of four.

25:18.393 --> 25:23.277
As far as you recall, describe going to class that first semester.

25:24.318 --> 25:47.438
Of course, in addition to going to Duncan and meeting at Duncan and the tough times that that would cause and all the, with the hazing and all and the questions, walking across campus was also probably the next biggest fear of fish because you're expected to know anybody that you've met plus meet those that you have not met if they're going in the same direction.

25:48.042 --> 25:49.824
It was quite an ordeal.

25:49.884 --> 25:58.093
In fact, and this is the truth, I'm not exaggerating, I still have dreams about trying to get across campus as a fish at A&M.

25:58.273 --> 25:59.494
This is 40 years later.

26:00.235 --> 26:08.223
And I still dream about being late for class because I'm whipping out and they're taking me all the way across opposite direction of where I'm supposed to be going.

26:08.804 --> 26:16.412
And I finally get to class and walk in and everybody's there and I'm embarrassed and I drop my books and I sit down and lo and behold it's the wrong class or I forgot my schedule

26:16.814 --> 26:23.735
I don't have my schedule with me, and that dream that keeps reoccurring 40 years later, but it was pretty traumatic.

26:23.755 --> 26:31.178
It's whipping out, but you learn to meet people and remember people, so it's one of the great traditions of A&M is meeting others, and that's why

26:31.597 --> 26:40.008
Even today, a campus of 40,000 is still, for the most part, a friendly, small atmosphere type campus.

26:40.809 --> 26:43.854
Describe going to class that first year.

26:44.595 --> 26:49.461
Were there some... There were a lot of classes that I was from New Boston town.

26:49.501 --> 26:59.815
You know, I had 56 in my graduating class and this small class, of course, everybody knew everybody and knew all the teachers even before you had them and went to church with them.

27:00.385 --> 27:04.876
And I ate with them at restaurants, so it was that type of atmosphere.

27:04.896 --> 27:12.796
The Texas A&M, which even though it was small in comparison to other schools or colleges, to me it was gigantic.

27:12.876 --> 27:16.285
And some of the classes would have, you know, 300 or so.

27:17.092 --> 27:23.442
some of the mandatory classes that everybody had to take, the English and the histories and things of that nature would have pretty big.

27:24.424 --> 27:28.670
Do you remember any of those first year teachers, classes?

27:28.690 --> 27:41.310
No, I have also tried to, and I tried to keep this from my son and daughter who wound up coming to Texas A&M that I was ashamed that I probably, I could tell them anything that happened in the Corps.

27:41.493 --> 27:48.081
but I couldn't tell them very much about what I learned in class and my memories of those days aren't like they should have been.

27:48.101 --> 27:56.932
All right, describe as much as you can the routine of a typical class day from the time you got up until you hit the sack.

27:57.432 --> 27:58.273
What did you get up?

27:58.574 --> 28:00.055
What time did you get up and what did you do?

28:00.896 --> 28:01.637
Go through the whole day.

28:01.657 --> 28:03.680
Well, it was more dark, the whistle jog.

28:03.700 --> 28:07.284
The first thing you would hear would be the whistle jog blowing.

28:08.205 --> 28:10.588
First call for chow in the mornings and

28:11.024 --> 28:14.068
and calling out fighting squadron two.

28:14.268 --> 28:15.190
First call for child.

28:15.250 --> 28:17.953
Fold out for child in 15 minutes in a class A uniform.

28:18.634 --> 28:26.625
And then he would recite the menu or the breakfast for the day, what we were having, eggs for cackle and bacon for bull.

28:26.685 --> 28:27.466
That would be it.

28:27.486 --> 28:28.268
At six?

28:28.548 --> 28:29.489
Six sounds right.

28:29.589 --> 28:31.412
I feel like that's what it was.

28:31.472 --> 28:38.922
And we'd have 10, 15 minutes before we had to be completely up, shaved, dressed, cleaned up,

28:39.965 --> 28:48.819
and in uniform and in the halls, standing at attention, ready to wildcat out of the dorm with our arms straight up, yelling as loud as we could.

28:48.839 --> 28:51.543
It was a great sound hearing that in the quad.

28:51.563 --> 29:07.609
I still love to hear that and to hold out in front of dorm six in formation and to get ready to morse to chow, which looking back was also a great time, especially, well let me continue with the day that we would morse to chow,

29:09.057 --> 29:20.894
Since everybody was having to go to class, the upperclassmen didn't buy you quite as much at breakfast because they also had to go to class and they couldn't just sit around like they did at the evening meal.

29:20.914 --> 29:34.052
But we'd get back to the dorm and get our books and head off to class and meet people on the way and be in class for several hours, probably until lunch.

29:34.370 --> 29:37.335
But in those days, we marched to chow all three meals.

29:37.876 --> 29:40.420
Now, what did you take with you to class?

29:41.041 --> 29:44.247
Well, we didn't have satchels or anything like that.

29:44.948 --> 29:49.015
We weren't allowed to take anything that might help us a little bit.

29:49.797 --> 29:57.610
So, it was just books and notebook and your pen or whatever's required, a pen, a pencil, you know, just

29:59.260 --> 30:01.523
Now, could you have a pen?

30:01.543 --> 30:02.625
No, you could not.

30:03.566 --> 30:06.690
You couldn't have anything in your uniform except what was military.

30:07.551 --> 30:11.396
And it just had to be, it was just all the same, straight laced.

30:11.416 --> 30:14.420
And in the dorm, in the normal routine, when did you all shower?

30:15.522 --> 30:16.583
In the mornings or at night?

30:19.607 --> 30:21.390
At night is what I want to say.

30:21.410 --> 30:23.693
It seems like it was at night most of the time.

30:23.873 --> 30:24.574
And you shaved?

30:24.694 --> 30:25.876
In the morning, usually.

30:26.176 --> 30:27.538
At the sink in your room?

30:27.558 --> 30:28.339
At the sink, yes.

30:28.741 --> 30:33.086
Yes, we did, and there were two of us or three of us there trying to use the same sink.

30:33.407 --> 30:36.510
Okay, so then off to class, and you're in class pretty well all morning.

30:36.530 --> 30:37.492
We are, we are.

30:37.632 --> 30:51.709
Come back for chow, get back, put our books up, fall out for chow, and actually march to chow as a unit, and come back and probably have some afternoon classes, and then usually intramurals.

30:51.729 --> 30:56.875
There's a real big-time intramural program at A&M and in the Corps, and you were expected

30:57.310 --> 31:24.955
participate, and of course I loved to anyway, and one of the differences I guess back then is also, that was during the regular work, I mean during the regular week, but back then the Saturdays were also taken up, even if it wasn't a ball game weekend, out on Duncan Field marching, for my mean, early in the morning, 5.30 or something in the morning, and you would go out there and practice marching and drilling and

31:25.407 --> 31:30.658
formations and learning a little bit about that aspect of the military life for several hours.

31:31.019 --> 31:34.927
All right, now there was all this emphasis on getting you whipped into shape for the Corps.

31:34.948 --> 31:35.388
Yes.

31:35.409 --> 31:39.838
What kind of preparation did they give you about studying and how to learn?
