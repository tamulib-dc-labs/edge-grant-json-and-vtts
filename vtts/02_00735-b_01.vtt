WEBVTT

00:04.469 --> 00:12.881
Have you ever been tempted to do

00:04.469 --> 00:12.881
announcing other than at Kyle Field? In other 
words, do radio broadcasts? Or has there ever been

00:14.804 --> 00:16.727
an opportunity to do that?

00:22.615 --> 00:29.144
When you say have I been tempted, I was asked 
yesterday by a gentleman in this town to go over

00:22.615 --> 00:29.144
here. I won't say where here is. but I don't think I 
will. Yes, I'd like it, I think, but I don't think I

00:35.419 --> 00:42.853
will. Yeah, I've thought about that

00:44.155 --> 00:49.605
kind of stuff. You know, one thing about some of 
these people on some of these programs, I don't

00:49.625 --> 00:55.536
mean the top fellas, but They don't pronounce the 
names of the athletes, and they mumble sometimes.

01:04.607 --> 01:12.639
And I think it's only common courtesy that you 
learn how to pronounce the names of the men you're

01:04.607 --> 01:12.639
dealing with. I try to find out. I do find out how to 
pronounce all the names of these. Oh, I make

01:18.508 --> 01:19.630
mistakes. Everybody does, of course, and I make 
more than most people. The mistakes I make, the

01:23.917 --> 01:25.999
fans don't see. What I was wondering about is, for 
example, for years, all of the Southwest

01:28.101 --> 01:37.330
Conference football games had been broadcast on 
the radio. Yeah. But I wondered if you had ever had

01:38.592 --> 01:48.101
an inclination to be involved in, say, the 
broadcast of some of the A&M games, or if you ever

01:38.592 --> 01:48.101
had been involved. No. You see that right next to 
me. Uh-huh. No, I, yeah, I think I kind of like it,

01:54.663 --> 01:58.507
just tell you the truth. I'm getting pretty old, 
though, you know, to get mixed up with that kind of

01:58.747 --> 02:03.793
stuff. Now, most people may not realize it, but 
it's pretty tense work up there. It's pretty

02:10.781 --> 02:13.083
tense. You can't get up there and look around at the 
seagulls and look around at the fan. You're going

02:18.209 --> 02:21.732
to watch what's going on down there all the time, 
see? And I have two spotters, and Every once in a

02:23.958 --> 02:32.550
while, you know, they'll be gazing over there at 
some girl over across the way, and I'll say, who had

02:23.958 --> 02:32.550
the ball there? I said, let's watch the ball game, 
you know, for a little while, and you've got to spot

02:32.570 --> 02:36.896
it over there. Now, let's, you know, kind of watch. 
But I've had pretty good spotters all the way

02:38.439 --> 02:40.802
along. Pretty good boys. But I check them. I have to 
check them. And then I want them to check me. So you

02:53.557 --> 02:57.082
have two spotters, one for each school? No, no. No. 
Yeah, one for each team. I do not want anybody up

03:00.711 --> 03:04.355
there from the opposition school. I want two 
Aggies, and I'll take this fellow, take A&M, and

03:04.515 --> 03:10.161
this fellow, take the other club. And he keeps the 
both club on offense and defense. Now, he's got

03:13.144 --> 03:14.646
speed cards there. They issue us speed cards, and 
it's easy to, you know, all you got to do is get the

03:15.146 --> 03:20.572
number and the name right there. Left speed cards 
on the offense and the depth on offense, speed

03:20.892 --> 03:28.440
cards on defense, depth on defense, and then the 
whole roster. And every once in a while you look out

03:28.994 --> 03:31.357
there and you'll see 96. It's not here.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.347
Well, that doesn't happen very often. It may be 
that somebody tears a jersey or something. They

03:42.271 --> 03:49.380
haven't had time to come up and let us know that 
there's been a change in jerseys or maybe a muddy

03:42.271 --> 03:49.380
field. That's fun, doing a game in mud. That's a 
guessing game. And I like to have two guys up there

03:54.286 --> 03:56.689
that can tell By the way the fellow walked out 
there, who he is, never mind his number. I couldn't

04:03.894 --> 04:04.535
tell. I don't see him that often. But I'm going over 
in a few days. They're going to start, what do you

04:07.681 --> 04:11.167
call it, tomorrow. Start to call workouts.

04:24.412 --> 04:28.617
You know what I'm going to do when I get through 
here? You don't need to put this on the table.

04:33.624 --> 04:40.913
You were saying you were going to go over to the 
athletic department in a few days and...

04:40.933 --> 04:46.320
I'll watch the scrimmages out there and 
familiarize myself with the ballplayers.

04:48.863 --> 04:54.250
But I go there a day early and get the program and I 
take it home and I look it over and I had one kiddo in a

04:55.327 --> 04:57.049
class. I get quite a few athletes in a class. I used 
to. And this kiddo, I was mispronouncing his name.

05:05.281 --> 05:07.224
So he came into one of my classes one day. I was told 
what his name was by over there. And I called the

05:13.834 --> 05:16.818
roll, and I called it this way. And then I said, is 
that right? pronounce a kiddo's name and then ask

05:20.487 --> 05:23.451
them, is that right? And I want them to pronounce 
their name, because I think it's sinful to

05:23.531 --> 05:28.357
mispronounce a person's name. It's their name, 
and they can have it pronounced any way they want

05:28.678 --> 05:31.361
to. And so this kiddo said, no, it's pronounced 
thus and so. I said, all right. So every day from

05:38.611 --> 05:43.598
then on, I'd pronounce it wrong, and then under my 
breath, I'd pronounce it right, you know. They got

05:43.618 --> 05:47.743
a big boot on their hands.

05:50.693 --> 06:01.545
Have

05:50.693 --> 06:01.545
you ever recorded any of your broadcasts from Kyle 
Field?

06:04.207 --> 06:05.028
No, I haven't. No. I don't know if anybody has. No, 
not to my knowledge. I don't think that he would

06:10.214 --> 06:13.778
very much. I don't know. I think for, say, 25 years, 
to all Aggies, you've been the voice of Kyle Field.

06:22.687 --> 06:30.656
And I was wondering if there was any consideration 
being given to encourage you for posterity,

06:22.687 --> 06:30.656
particularly your opening remarks. I don't think 
posterity. Oh, I had a fellow come in here from

06:32.599 --> 06:36.403
somewhere, I don't know, somewhere on a campus. He 
was doing a... doing a movie or some kind of a thing,

06:37.876 --> 06:43.942
and he asked me if I would repeat that, give that 
line. And he set up his stuff, and I gave it to him two

06:44.783 --> 06:51.370
or three times, and he locked his kit up and went 
off. And I haven't seen him since. But other than

06:52.872 --> 06:55.755
that, I don't... How long ago was this? I don't 
know. A few years ago. A few years ago. Was that... I

07:02.041 --> 07:05.385
don't even remember who he was now or what he was... 
cooked up with, but some department here on the

07:06.040 --> 07:08.503
county. It could have been architecture. Could 
have been. Well, they did a movie here a few years

07:11.226 --> 07:14.110
ago, kind of a recruiting film. I've seen parts of 
it. What was the name of that? Focus on the Future, I

07:19.276 --> 07:21.739
believe, was what? I don't know whether that one's 
been in or not.

07:27.986 --> 07:35.575
I

07:27.986 --> 07:35.575
believe when I called you, I indicated I was 
talking with former students retired or retiring

07:35.842 --> 07:44.111
faculty members, and you're due to retire in a very 
few days, what plans do you have for the future?

07:45.112 --> 07:49.657
Will you be continuing with theater arts in at all?

07:52.960 --> 07:56.584
No, I don't have any plans of doing any future work 
in theater. I dearly love it. I'd really like,

07:58.587 --> 08:05.494
really, and this is what I'd really like to do, I'd 
like to do some more acting, but I cannot remember

08:06.942 --> 08:09.205
lines. When I first started in, you know, we had 
some good directors up there, and he had sling in a

08:11.287 --> 08:17.074
book. I said, I want act one tomorrow night. We'd 
memorize an act a night, and we'd get a show ready in

08:20.939 --> 08:26.926
pretty short order and do it quite well. It's not 
stage fright, as far as I'm concerned. I can talk to

08:31.492 --> 08:32.713
a a bunch of people. I'm not staged, right? But I 
cannot, for some reason or other, remember lying.

08:39.391 --> 08:42.898
That strange thing happened a few years ago. We 
were doing a great big show in Guyana with Mrs.

08:42.918 --> 08:48.048
Morgan, and I took part. She had two one-act plays, 
and they were part of it. We had choruses. We had

08:51.816 --> 08:52.778
everything. And I made up a little scene. It was a 
big thing. We filled iron twice. I had about a

08:58.864 --> 09:01.647
couple of thousand people in there both times. It 
only holds 1,775. And I played with Mrs. Delaplane

09:05.010 --> 09:09.174
with one scene. And I was playing with Harry 
Gooding in another. I forget the names of the

09:11.737 --> 09:14.720
little shows now. And I was directing the whole 
thing at the same time. And there was a table. And I

09:20.245 --> 09:23.068
was playing the devil. the naughty fella. And 
there was a table here, and Harry was sitting here.

09:27.893 --> 09:28.114
It was J. Best Stone, I believe was the name of the 
thing. And I came over. I had all my stuff on the

09:32.340 --> 09:38.729
table, all my lines pasted on the table very 
neatly. And I came over, you know, and I looked down

09:39.289 --> 09:41.933
there. The stage kids had taken all that stuff off, 
and there I was without a single solitary line. So

09:53.390 --> 09:55.114
we got through the scene somehow. Now, I probably 
won't. I'm going to spend a great deal of my time

09:57.220 --> 10:04.959
from now on working with orphans, kiddos without a 
mom and a papa. Now, there are not very many people

10:04.979 --> 10:10.774
that ever stop to think about kiddos without a mama 
and a papa. I know these Texas orphanages are

10:14.865 --> 10:17.851
pretty well fixed. They're run, a lot of them, by 
churches. And they feed them well, and they clothe

10:21.138 --> 10:25.005
them well, and they go to public schools. Some of 
them have their own schools. And they live in

10:27.190 --> 10:32.300
little cottages, and they have a house mother, and 
they have many, many conveniences. I know all of

10:32.420 --> 10:33.943
that. And they're treated beautifully. Some of 
them treated much better than they would be at

10:35.426 --> 10:38.010
home. And some of them have a mother and a father. 
Some of them have one, some have the other. And some

10:43.680 --> 10:47.948
of the kiddos don't want, they've been given up. 
Their folks don't want them, and that's why they

10:47.988 --> 10:51.334
land in these homes. Well, I'm in contact now with 
three different homes here in Texas. That's what

10:55.000 --> 10:56.202
they call them, homes. And what I want to do is to 
spend a little time going around, if possible,

10:57.312 --> 11:10.826
that's what this last call was about, making 
little talks to these little churches around the

10:57.312 --> 11:10.826
area here. I'm not going to go out there and cry. I'm 
not going to bleed. I'm not going to beg for

11:15.290 --> 11:16.692
anything. I'm just going to put down the cold facts 
and issue them a little challenge. I want to do

11:21.537 --> 11:25.581
something personal for these little kids, the 
little squirts. Now, don't you think a little

11:25.932 --> 11:55.062
six-year-old girl would love to have a pair of cute 
little panties all her own or a little necklace or a

11:25.932 --> 11:55.062
little bracelet or a barrette or something, and a 
boy would like to have a little, I don't know,

11:25.932 --> 11:55.062
T-shirt or something like that that is his, and he 
gets it with his name on it as a present from

11:25.932 --> 11:55.062
somebody. Now, that's what I want to do. But I want 
to be very careful, and I'm going to proceed very

11:59.075 --> 12:03.021
slowly at this thing. I want to be very careful that 
the people, a group of people in any church, don't

12:03.041 --> 12:11.393
do it just one time. I want it to continue. I want 
them to take an interest in this one cottage. And

12:16.641 --> 12:20.847
there are anywhere from 8 to 10 to 12 kiddos in a 
cottage. And I don't want every kiddo in there to

12:21.755 --> 12:25.661
get something at the same time. You know, I don't 
want this kiddo to get something. And most of them,

12:28.245 --> 12:35.636
sometimes they'll have a six-year-old girl, a 
16-year-old girl, and they mix them up in a kind. So

12:35.656 --> 12:41.344
it's more like a family rather than have all 
six-year-olds in one cottage. But that's what I

12:42.506 --> 12:44.109
want to do in brief. And it's going to take me a 
little bit of time to get the thing organized. and

12:47.624 --> 12:50.670
to get it in operation. But that's what I want to do. 
And I'd like to have these people go visit these

12:53.855 --> 12:59.005
kids once in a while. Boy, you...

13:02.371 --> 13:02.912
I don't know. Where I was, I don't know. This had 
nothing to do with this, but it does in a way. For

13:09.562 --> 13:17.891
years, in the past, I took stuff to orphanages, but 
it was just a truckload of this stuff and a

13:09.562 --> 13:17.891
truckload of that. Nothing personal, see? And I 
can remember when I was in the orphanage, it was in

13:20.314 --> 13:26.621
23 Toby Street, Providence, Rhode Island. I can 
remember that. As I say, I can't remember what

13:27.982 --> 13:32.447
happened last week, but I can remember very 
vividly Many, many, many things that happened 60

13:32.900 --> 13:37.287
years ago in that place. It was, we were, well, I'm 
not going to go into gory details of it, but I

13:37.307 --> 13:46.721
remember one time they had bars on the window of our 
playroom. And I remember one time gripping those

13:46.761 --> 13:52.710
bars and looking out there and I said, if I ever get 
out of here, I'm going to burn this place down.

13:53.872 --> 13:55.614
Well, I finally got taken out. I wasn't adopted, 
but I was taken out for some unknown reason. And

14:00.558 --> 14:03.562
about six months after I got out of there, the place 
burned down. And I was about 25 miles from there, up

14:04.503 --> 14:09.770
in Massachusetts, out in the country. And I ran 
out. I ran away. I ran out in the woods, and I spent

14:13.094 --> 14:15.938
all day out in those woods. And I came in late at 
night, and a lady asked me where I'd been, and I told

14:16.599 --> 14:21.746
her. I knew they were coming after me.

14:26.472 --> 14:27.753
Oh, boy, I was scared. I knew they were going to get 
me. But that's what I want to do. That's what I want

14:33.654 --> 14:37.741
to spend a considerable part of my time doing. 
Because I am not going to go home and sit and wither.

14:42.809 --> 14:45.213
That's what you'll do if you go home and sit. Or if 
you don't have something to occupy yourself. You

14:49.319 --> 14:52.564
can get in and ride around here, walk here, visit 
here, visit there. But I feel that if a person is

14:53.165 --> 14:57.312
able... He better stay active as long as he can. 
What you have outlined is certainly a worthwhile

15:03.754 --> 15:11.944
endeavor, certainly a contribution to... I am not 
doing this for my own sake. Let me tell you

15:14.807 --> 15:17.370
something. I have a reputation, I guess, of being 
very mean. At least my students think I'm mean. And

15:24.758 --> 15:27.822
I presume I am, but I got a lot of that stuff... early 
in life, and a lot of it hasn't brushed off and it

15:28.325 --> 15:32.531
never will. This is something that needs to be 
done, in my opinion. It needs to be done.

15:42.846 --> 15:47.112
Therefore,

15:42.846 --> 15:47.112
I want to do it. It's nothing to me. I want to stay out 
of the picture. I don't want to be mentioned at all.

15:51.578 --> 15:53.100
I just want to be the igniter. Well, I didn't even 
imply that I thought you were doing it. No, no, I

15:56.400 --> 15:57.663
know you didn't. No, I know you didn't. But that's 
how deeply I feel about this thing. It has to be

16:04.017 --> 16:05.440
done. And somebody, oh, I know a lot of these 
churches do a lot of these things at Christmas.

16:10.571 --> 16:13.097
Now, don't you think it'd be a good idea to send 
somebody to the offense? Yeah, Christmas, they

16:13.955 --> 16:16.199
get a ton of candy. What I'm concerned about is the 
13th of July. I'm concerned about the 20th of

16:19.323 --> 16:22.048
March. I'm concerned about the 10th of October. 
Now, you don't have to send them a present every

16:25.673 --> 16:38.333
day, but they ought to get something occasionally 
to let them know that somebody out there knows that

16:25.673 --> 16:38.333
they're in here. That's the thing, you see. That's 
the thing that's important to me. Then on the other

16:42.338 --> 16:49.628
end of the deal, they keep these kiddos until they 
get through high school. Now on the other end of the

16:49.648 --> 17:04.448
deal, I am going to make a valiant effort to see if I 
can't find agency somewhere or money available

16:49.648 --> 17:04.448
somewhere where some of these worthy kids can go to 
college. Now, there's a lot of money hanging

17:05.305 --> 17:14.596
around at various universities that nobody seems 
to know anything about in the form of little

17:05.305 --> 17:14.596
scholarships. And they're not all based on 
academic excellence. They're based on need. And

17:20.863 --> 17:29.093
if anyone needs assistance, some of these little 
fellas getting out of these places have been in

17:20.863 --> 17:29.093
there 10 years or more. They need it. And that's the 
other end of the picture that I'm going to look

17:31.476 --> 17:35.160
into. I've helped quite a few kids through school, 
but that's nobody's business. But now that I've

17:41.509 --> 17:52.787
got time,

17:41.509 --> 17:52.787
that's what I want to do, and I think I'm going to 
feel pretty good doing it. I mean, because it needs

17:53.388 --> 17:56.093
to be done. That's what I mean. There's too many of 
us, you know, we talk about helping our fellow man,

18:00.655 --> 18:06.221
but what do we do? We sit in our can and... Now, I just 
came back from a trip up the Lake of the Ozarks, and

18:06.261 --> 18:20.537
me and my wife, we met one of our kiddos up there and 
our grandkids, and we spent a few days up there. And

18:20.557 --> 18:26.723
I looked around at all of the facilities at these 
semi-rich people. Now, they weren't rich, but

18:26.783 --> 18:30.207
there they were playing. which is all right. I 
maintain that a person never should forget how to

18:32.897 --> 18:36.240
play. You should never grow up all the way. I tell my 
students that all the time. They sit there and

18:39.523 --> 18:40.484
snicker. Now, this afternoon, I play out in my 
backyard every time I get a chance. I'm this

18:45.108 --> 18:45.889
afternoon. I can't wait to get out there and mow and 
do a little digging. I got a little garden out there

18:49.372 --> 18:53.355
and no grow much, but I have a lot of fun. Get out 
there and sweat and play. That's what I call it. Sit

18:57.719 --> 19:01.122
and talk to the birds and the cats and the dogs and 
Bunny Squirrel, that little son of a gun, he's in

19:01.895 --> 19:04.938
there every day. Every time I turn around, there he 
is. Out there having a lot of fun. I talk to him. And I

19:11.264 --> 19:13.626
ask my students, I said, you ever talk to yourself? 
And they look at me like I'm half nuts. And finally,

19:15.508 --> 19:19.752
they'll admit that most of them do talk to 
themselves. And they said, do you? I said, yeah, I

19:20.533 --> 19:22.835
don't know anybody smarter than I am. I get a lot of 
fun talking to me. I got all the answers. I got all

19:26.359 --> 19:27.440
the questions. And I just sit there and puff my 
pipe. And I have a lot of fun talking to myself,

19:30.042 --> 19:33.767
because I give myself the right answers. But 
that's what I intend to do. I've had a couple of jobs

19:37.992 --> 19:39.894
offered to me. I had one. I won't mention who it is. 
It probably won't open up until another six or

19:42.097 --> 19:46.743
eight months. But it's a public relations thing. 
You know, a little thing. You can't afford to take a

19:51.108 --> 19:53.451
job that pays you any money. Well, the government 
will take it right away from you, you know what I

19:54.477 --> 19:57.401
mean? Well, I'm all set up now to draw my pension and 
my Social Security, and I think I've earned them

19:57.421 --> 20:03.048
both. I've put in many thousands of dollars in both 
of them. And I'm not too anxious to... I'm anxious

20:09.676 --> 20:20.670
to go to work for these fellas so I can meet people 
and have a lot of fun, but I don't want any, you know,

20:09.676 --> 20:20.670
no great money for it because... The more you get, 
the more they take away from you. Well, and as far as

20:24.243 --> 20:42.788
meeting people, I would say that the more people 
you can meet, the more contacts you have for your

20:24.243 --> 20:42.788
other project of working, in a sense, for the 
orphanages, or for the benefit of them, for the

20:24.243 --> 20:42.788
kids in the orphanages. You see, I don't want 
money. I don't want money. I don't want people to

20:47.133 --> 20:48.495
give me any money. I wouldn't know what to do. Well, 
I'd know what to do with it, but... I want to make it a

20:52.173 --> 20:55.156
personal thing. Well, you're wanting things for 
the kitchen. Little things. They don't have to be

20:58.460 --> 20:59.621
big things. Little things a kid will get and he'll 
open it. He said, gee, my name is on this. This is for

21:03.686 --> 21:04.226
me. And he opens it up there and there it is. Gosh, 
this is mine. It's not a truckload of stuff from a

21:08.031 --> 21:15.699
hardware store or department store that they buy 
and just, here's yours, James. Here's yours,

21:15.719 --> 21:17.421
Jack, and so forth. It's just a personal thing. You 
don't know how much that would mean to a kid to get

21:19.194 --> 21:26.961
some little, small thing, a couple of bucks or 
something like that. Every once in a while, it's

21:27.541 --> 21:29.503
his own.

21:33.146 --> 21:33.787
I can remember. We never got any in my place. 
Everything belonged to the orphanage, and you

21:36.349 --> 21:38.431
used it. Well, it didn't belong to anybody. As I 
say, all our clothes were secondhand when we got

21:42.635 --> 21:46.598
them. secondhand toothbrush, everything. Never 
got enough to eat. Now, I'm not complaining. Now,

21:52.987 --> 21:54.209
don't misunderstand me. I'm just stating facts. 
And in the wintertime, because it was winter up

21:57.594 --> 22:05.407
there, they had a big room there that had cloaks, 
they called a cloak room, sweaters and coats and so

21:57.594 --> 22:05.407
forth. You had one pair of pants, and that's what 
they wore, them knee things and long black

22:06.889 --> 22:15.302
stockings and a shirt and underwear, long 
underwear. And when it was cold, we went down in a

22:17.037 --> 22:21.441
cloak room. And we'd fight.

22:25.225 --> 22:27.246
Nobody had anything that belonged to him. There 
was always a fight. I walked out of there one

22:30.469 --> 22:33.192
morning with six sweaters. I learned to fight in 
that office. I was only a little squirt. I was

22:38.657 --> 22:43.421
only six, seven years old. And they used to take us 
to Sunday school. Line us up, two by two. March down

22:48.500 --> 22:49.861
to Sunday School. I remember that very 
vigorously. And the old lady there, she'd walk

22:52.305 --> 22:54.828
along with a thing. It looked like an umbrella, but 
it was a club.

22:59.674 --> 23:03.198
And they'd get down there, and they'd tell us about 
the sweet little Jesus.

23:06.423 --> 23:07.284
I said, that's fine. But I never heard any of that 
the rest of the week. They just wailed us and we

23:12.100 --> 23:14.083
worked. Now, I'm not making this up, buddy. I'm 
sure you're not. Now, there's no comparison

23:19.010 --> 23:23.456
between the place I was in and the place these 
kiddos are in now. But I've been to quite a few of

23:23.476 --> 23:25.879
these homes and they're beautiful. Some of them 
are absolutely, almost luxurious, you know. But

23:30.746 --> 23:31.767
they worked us. Inspect, inspect. We went to the 
public school. And you think we didn't have our

23:39.057 --> 23:40.960
problems there? I'm sure you did. You think we 
didn't have our fights there? We haven't. Even

23:48.689 --> 23:53.453
though Providence is a fairly sizable city and... 
It has its slum areas. Well, what I'm about to say is

23:54.895 --> 24:00.700
that there was no way to keep it a secret as to where 
you were coming from. Oh, no. They could tell by

24:01.081 --> 24:04.884
looking at you, you stinking little ragamuffin. I 
mean, we were fighting with our classmates.

24:09.268 --> 24:09.989
That's what I mean. The kids was in the room. And a 
kid will come up to see you and on the playground he

24:11.872 --> 24:16.398
says, I'll get you. That means he's going to get you 
on the way home. And he'll lay for you. That was the

24:22.626 --> 24:23.988
term. I'm going to lay for you.

24:28.154 --> 24:29.235
And he's but one way home. And you had a fight on the 
way home. Then you get home and they're wondering

24:32.239 --> 24:35.283
why you got a bloody nose or something. Then you 
have to lie about that. But if you told them the

24:37.370 --> 24:40.895
truth, they'd give you another walloping for 
fight. For fight, yeah. I mean, you couldn't win,

24:42.417 --> 24:43.859
too. You know, you couldn't win. It was right next 
to a railroad where they had a lot of, you know,

24:45.882 --> 24:53.934
railroad, what do you call it, where all the trains 
were. Footyard? Yeah. And this is a big freight

24:54.996 --> 24:57.339
area. I've seen kids run away from that. And I saw 
them when they brought them back. And they stuck

25:04.810 --> 25:06.853
them in solitary for a while. And I was tempted to 
run away. But I was smarter than that. I knew I

25:13.953 --> 25:15.395
didn't have any place to go. I mean, the cops are 
going to pick you up very shortly. And they know

25:18.480 --> 25:19.582
where you're from. They caught you right there. So 
I didn't try to run away. I was smart enough to know I

25:22.927 --> 25:26.513
didn't have any place to go. When you came back. 
Yeah, you bet your life was worth it. And they had,

25:31.516 --> 25:36.682
they also had, they had boys and girls there too, 
but I didn't know at that age, I didn't know a boy

25:31.516 --> 25:36.682
from a girl. But I do remember we lined up here and 
they lined up over there. And I looked straight

25:40.426 --> 25:41.387
ahead. I mean, I didn't even know what a girl was. 
But I do remember I was a big boy. And each big boy had

25:47.254 --> 25:50.637
a little boy to give him a bath on Saturday. And I had 
a little guy named Eddie Egan. And he didn't want to

25:55.484 --> 25:59.988
take a bath, and I'd chase him all over that plain, 
have to rip his clothes off. And they had these zinc

26:00.008 --> 26:01.550
bathtubs. I don't know whether you ever saw one of 
them. Zinc inside and wood on the outside. You get a

26:05.854 --> 26:11.019
little corner ripped up on that, and you skate 
along that, it'll tear you up pretty good. Well,

26:11.700 --> 26:18.006
I'd get him in there, and there'd be about eight or 
ten kids take a bath in the same bath water. I'd

26:18.026 --> 26:21.469
finally get him in there, and I'd rub soap all over 
his eyes. And after you get him in there, he gets

26:21.529 --> 26:24.192
slippery. And I tried to drown him three or four 
times, but I never could drown him. I'm not kidding

26:31.256 --> 26:32.037
you. I'm saying, oh, he made, man, I'm telling you, 
I'd beat that kid half to death. I wonder whatever

26:37.710 --> 26:41.498
became of him. He was about, well, he was about two 
years old, three years old, I mean. That little son

26:45.755 --> 26:50.162
of a gun, I'm telling you, we had him around and 
around every Saturday. I can imagine. I had a

26:51.965 --> 26:55.471
couple boys at two with him. Well, actually, I 
guess they were more interested in taking him back

26:55.491 --> 27:03.083
as a place to play, but they had not had six other 
people in the water before. We didn't have any play

27:03.164 --> 27:04.766
with him. The funny thing was, I was six, seven 
years old, and I was a big boy. I was a big boy. And I

27:10.315 --> 27:11.998
had that little son of a gun. And that was one of my 
jobs, give him a bath every Saturday. And he'd

27:18.842 --> 27:21.606
fight and kick and holler. I mean, that place was a 
bedlam. It was a bedlam. Because each big boy had a

27:26.892 --> 27:29.155
little boy to give him a bath. And sometimes we'd 
get two in a tub and exchange them and knock their

27:29.255 --> 27:36.805
heads together and do all kinds of... Oh, we were 
mean. I mean, you know, I mean... Well, in a sense,

27:36.869 --> 27:42.037
you were passing down the treatment that was 
handed out to you, I guess. Yes, I guess so.

27:47.986 --> 27:51.712
Well, anyway, that has nothing to do with what I'm 
going to do in the future. And I'm sure these kiddos

27:52.333 --> 27:56.279
don't go through the same stuff we went through. 
But I do know that they would love dearly to get some

27:56.299 --> 28:00.025
little... some little remembrance every once in a 
while from somebody to let them know that somebody

28:00.781 --> 28:10.902
thinks of me once in a while. That's all I want to do 
on a very small scale.

28:17.251 --> 28:22.818
I'm sure that the way everything you say is true, 
and they certainly will appreciate it. More than

28:24.140 --> 28:26.463
likely, they won't know who was the instigator. 
No, I don't want them to know that. That's none of

28:28.907 --> 28:30.268
their business. I just want them to know that John 
got a present from Mrs. Brown. I just want to steer

28:35.836 --> 28:38.179
up Mrs. Brown a little. Oh, I'm going to visit these 
places. I know that the two of the

28:41.232 --> 28:49.220
superintendents, I've met them before, years 
back. But this one down in San Antonio, that's the

28:50.121 --> 28:54.306
one that intrigues me. Because they need it more 
than anywhere else, any other often in the state

28:54.326 --> 29:00.632
that I know anything about. But as I go along, the 
good Lord willing, I'll find out more about this

29:00.652 --> 29:06.678
stuff. Do what I can. I'm sure you will have plenty 
to do. Well, I'm going to give it a try.
