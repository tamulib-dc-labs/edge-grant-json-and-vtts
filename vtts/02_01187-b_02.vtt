00:02.714 --> 00:05.217
Let's see if this works better than Mars Observer. 
Okay, this is Ron Sharn interviewing Dale

00:06.859 --> 00:13.647
Cruickshank, Older Colorado, October 19th, 
1993.

00:16.090 --> 00:20.415
Dale, for the record, would you please give your 
full name? Yes, I am Dale Paul Cruickshank. And

00:23.959 --> 00:24.980
when and where were you born? I was born in Des 
Moines, Iowa, 1939, August 10th. When did you get

00:29.265 --> 00:30.687
interested in astronomy? I got interested in 
astronomy... When I was about 12 or 13 years old,

00:33.241 --> 00:48.497
the first astronomical event of my life was the 
total eclipse of the sun of June 30, 1954, at which

00:33.241 --> 00:48.497
time I was 13 years old, I think. And my mother took 
me and a school friend to northern Michigan to see

00:49.478 --> 00:55.684
the totality phase. And it was a success. And from 
then on, it was clear that I had to be an astronomer.

01:01.422 --> 01:03.065
Okay, where did you go to undergraduate school? I 
was an undergraduate physics major at Iowa State

01:03.085 --> 01:07.191
University in Ames. I graduated from there in 1961 
and went from there then to the University of

01:07.972 --> 01:17.448
Arizona where I was a graduate student. I got a 
master's degree in planetary geology in 1966, I

01:18.990 --> 01:28.425
believe it was, and finished a PhD in 1968. also in 
the geology department with an emphasis on

01:28.793 --> 01:33.258
planetary geology. So what were you doing at 
Yerkes in the summer of 1959? When I was midway

01:36.922 --> 01:52.059
through my freshman year at Iowa State, I already 
started thinking about graduate school and began

01:36.922 --> 01:52.059
to write to various schools that had astronomy 
programs, and one of those schools, of course, was

01:36.922 --> 01:52.059
the University of Chicago. And I got a very nice 
letter back answering the questions I had asked,

01:56.941 --> 02:04.268
and telling me about a summer program that was held 
at Yerkes Observatory for undergraduates and

01:56.941 --> 02:04.268
inviting me to apply for that. I did apply and was 
told that the program was really for more advanced

02:04.949 --> 02:18.581
undergraduates than someone who was just 
finishing their freshman year, but that if I could

02:04.949 --> 02:18.581
provide a suitable letter of recommendation, 
they would consider my application. So this was

02:19.422 --> 02:25.648
correspondence with Joe Chamberlain, who at the 
time was the chairman of the student admission

02:19.422 --> 02:25.648
program, I think. So I managed to get a letter of 
recommendation from Philip Riggs, who was the

02:26.168 --> 02:39.482
astronomer at the Drake University and operated 
the Drake Municipal Observatory, and with whom

02:26.168 --> 02:39.482
I'd become friends because I lived in Des Moines. 
And so Riggs sent a letter of recommendation that

02:40.603 --> 02:46.550
was accepted by Chamberlain and the committee, 
and I was offered the summer job. So I showed up at

02:46.950 --> 02:51.775
Yerkes in the early summer of 1958.

02:55.379 --> 02:56.040
What did you do there? The first summer, I worked in 
the darkroom on Kuiper's lunar atlas project, at

02:56.813 --> 03:20.042
which time he was assembling the photographs from 
ground-based telescopes around the world, the

02:56.813 --> 03:20.042
best lunar photographs to assemble into the lunar 
atlas that was supported by the US Air Force. And I

03:20.943 --> 03:26.550
remember I'd had a lot of experience with darkroom 
work just as an amateur photographer. It was

03:26.969 --> 03:31.596
pretty easy to fit into that role, and I enjoyed it a 
lot. I remember the thrill on one afternoon when

03:31.656 --> 03:47.780
Kuiper came around to the dark rooms shortly after 
I had arrived and introduced himself and saw what I

03:31.656 --> 03:47.780
was doing and came in and was helping me produce a 
couple of prints from some of these lunar

03:31.656 --> 03:47.780
negatives. And there we stood side by side with our 
hands in the developer tank rubbing on one of these

03:48.501 --> 03:55.812
prints to try to increase the development in a 
place that needed a little bit of extra help. And it

03:59.328 --> 04:04.697
was a real thrill because I had known Kuyper's 
name, of course, from reading the textbooks and so

03:59.328 --> 04:04.697
on. And there we were in the darkroom rubbing 
prints together. We'll get back to him in a while.

04:09.846 --> 04:12.090
But now, you got your PhD in what year? 1968. OK. 
Where did you go from there? I went pretty much

04:16.137 --> 04:22.187
directly to Moscow from there. I had been 
interested in Russia, Russian language, Russian

04:22.910 --> 04:32.562
culture, the Russian science program since 
undergraduate days when I started to study the

04:22.910 --> 04:32.562
language. And Kuiper was interested in it, too. I, 
of course, spent my graduate years with him there

04:34.945 --> 04:39.011
in Tucson. And he had developed contacts with the 
Soviet Union in terms of its lunar and planetary

04:39.912 --> 04:47.401
exploration program. And I asked him to help me try 
to get one of the National Academy of Sciences

04:52.357 --> 04:56.983
exchange appointments to the Soviet Union. The 
exchange program was fairly quiet, but

04:57.043 --> 05:01.369
reasonably active at the time. And he helped, and I 
got one of the appointments. So shortly after I got

05:05.034 --> 05:18.212
my degree, within a couple of months, I took off for 
Moscow, spent a better part of a year there, and

05:05.034 --> 05:18.212
returned to Tucson in the summer of 1969. What did 
you do, aside from hearing me over the radio in the

05:18.547 --> 05:25.939
caucuses one time, what did you do in Moscow? The 
reason that it made sense to go there in the first

05:27.821 --> 05:46.090
place is that Vasily Moroz was a planetary 
astronomer working in the near infrared with

05:27.821 --> 05:46.090
equipment very comparable in quality to what 
Kuiper had in Tucson and the equipment that I had

05:27.821 --> 05:46.090
used under Kuiper's direction in Tucson. So it 
made sense to go there and find out what Moroz was

05:46.492 --> 05:51.998
doing to work with him on planetary problems and so 
on. He received me in Moscow, and we did, in fact,

05:53.219 --> 05:58.786
work together. We observed together in the 
Crimea, wrote a couple of papers, and it was, in

05:58.826 --> 06:05.513
general, quite an adventure. So it was an 
opportunity to spend 10 or 11 months with the

06:05.613 --> 06:16.465
Russian counterpart of Kuiper's program to 
assess what they were doing to actually make a a few

06:16.748 --> 06:19.532
interesting observations, write a couple of 
papers. Where'd you go from there? I went back to

06:21.494 --> 06:32.449
Tucson in the summer of 69 and spent almost, well, 
essentially a year there as Kuiper's associate.

06:32.990 --> 06:45.827
It was clear, however, that I would always be cast 
in the role of a former student, and Kuiper and I had

06:32.990 --> 06:45.827
a couple of tussles over scientific issues during 
that year's time. I was talking at the same time

06:46.313 --> 07:00.717
with the people in Hawaii, namely Bob Murphy, who 
is now at NASA headquarters, David Morrison, and

06:46.313 --> 07:00.717
with Bill Sinton and John Jeffries at the 
University of Hawaii about a possible position

06:46.313 --> 07:00.717
there. And they offered one. I originally turned 
it down, and then when things got tight with Kuiper

07:03.021 --> 07:08.991
again, it looked like it would be appropriate to 
accept it. I did, and then in either late June or

07:09.492 --> 07:12.777
early July, I took off for Hawaii and stayed there 
for the better part of 18 years. What did you do at

07:18.313 --> 07:19.774
Hawaii? Hawaii was, in the summer of 1970, putting 
the finishing touches on the 2.2-meter telescope

07:20.055 --> 07:31.607
that the NASA Planetary Program had funded. NASA 
built the telescope roughly at a cost of $3

07:32.568 --> 07:35.532
million. The state of Hawaii provided the 
building and infrastructure roughly for a cost of

07:36.393 --> 07:40.317
$2 This was one, of course, of the several NASA 
telescopes that were built during that era. And

07:46.933 --> 07:55.365
they were trying to build a program of 
ground-based astronomy, nighttime

07:46.933 --> 07:55.365
ground-based astronomy, because they already 
had a solar program. And we're building staff.

07:57.488 --> 07:59.190
We're finishing up this telescope and so on. So it 
was an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of

07:59.250 --> 08:09.325
the exploitation and development of Mauna Kea as a 
ground-based observing site which turned out, of

08:09.659 --> 08:13.583
course, later to be world-class quality. So I went 
to Hawaii on a research position with no teaching

08:15.625 --> 08:35.604
obligations, and it was one of those very rare 
opportunities to move into an academic setting

08:15.625 --> 08:35.604
with all of the best of the opportunities and very 
little of the liabilities. What did you work on? I

08:37.435 --> 08:40.319
began working immediately on planetary 
problems. The 2.2 meter telescope had a large Kude

08:40.840 --> 08:48.631
spectrograph, which was available essentially 
as the telescope was commissioned. And I began

08:48.651 --> 08:53.839
doing high dispersion Kude spectroscopy, 
photographic spectroscopy. And I remember the

08:54.460 --> 08:57.564
first problem I worked on was ammonia on Saturn. 
There was not at that time a positive detection of

08:58.285 --> 09:03.493
ammonia on Saturn, although it was obvious on 
Jupiter. Although it was in some textbooks, but it

09:03.895 --> 09:06.698
was wrong. That's right, yes. So I used,

09:08.100 --> 09:27.461
I think not the highest, but next highest 
dispersion spectrograph with about two

09:08.100 --> 09:27.461
angstroms per millimeter photographic looking 
for the 6450 band of ammonia on Saturn, and I

09:08.100 --> 09:27.461
couldn't find it with what I thought was a rather 
high sensitivity limit. So I published an

09:28.101 --> 09:33.227
abstract and presented that at a DPS meeting, I 
think in 1971, I believe, I'm not certain, but I

09:33.578 --> 09:41.370
believe that my abstract was the first published 
scientific result from the 88-inch or 2.2-meter

09:33.578 --> 09:41.370
telescope. I've never made a point of that to my 
Hawaii colleagues, but for what it's worth, I

09:41.910 --> 09:47.599
think that is in fact true. Where did you go after 
Hawaii? Well, of course, Hawaii was an experience

09:51.304 --> 10:01.780
that ran nearly 18 years, and so I'd really 
developed almost all of my professional career

09:51.304 --> 10:01.780
during that period. I left Hawaii after 17 and a 
half years. In what year? I believe late 87 and

10:08.080 --> 10:15.735
began a position at NASA Ames Research Center in 
California in January of 88. Why the switch? I made

10:17.478 --> 10:22.468
the switch primarily because my family and I were 
tired of living in Hawaii. And it was, in fact, that

10:23.005 --> 10:30.235
personal decision that motivated us to consider 
leaving the islands. Hawaii had tremendous

10:31.197 --> 10:44.536
professional opportunities and advantages, and 
I was not in the slightest dissatisfied with those

10:31.197 --> 10:44.536
professional aspects of the situation. The 
Institute for Astronomy during that 17 and a half

10:45.377 --> 10:49.283
years certainly did change, But I was very much a 
part of it. I was made to feel extremely welcome and

10:52.211 --> 10:56.355
valued there. Yet, based on my family's personal 
desire to return to the mainland United States, we

10:56.395 --> 11:06.927
decided to leave Hawaii. And the opportunity for a 
position at NASA Ames arose largely through the

11:07.107 --> 11:17.278
help of Michael Werner and James Pollock at NASA 
Ames, both of whom wanted me there. And so they made

11:22.892 --> 11:24.394
an opportunity, and we took it. Are you still 
there? I'm still at NASA Ames. It's coming up on six

11:27.399 --> 11:28.480
years. What are you doing, or what have you done? 
I'm continuing the very kind of thing I was doing in

11:30.743 --> 11:40.397
Hawaii, specifically spectroscopy in the 
infrared and near-infrared of planetary

11:30.743 --> 11:40.397
objects. And during the time since I started that 
business in the early 60s, which has now been

11:47.043 --> 11:48.326
almost exactly 30 years. Enormous advances have 
been made in the technology of infrared

11:50.210 --> 12:07.127
observations at all wavelengths and it's a real 
pleasure and a thrill to still ride on the crest of

11:50.210 --> 12:07.127
that wave as we continue to open up new levels of 
sensitivity and brightness and difficulty in

12:07.580 --> 12:20.840
looking at the infrared spectral signatures of 
small, distant, faint, cold solar system bodies.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.463
Isn't it nice not to have to ammoniate plates 
anymore? It's nice not to have to ammoniate

12:23.483 --> 12:26.708
plates, and I did a fair amount of that too. I still 
have scars from some of that, but that's another

12:27.590 --> 12:30.253
story. You're the obvious person to ask this. 
While this project that I'm doing is subtitled

12:37.533 --> 12:41.398
NASA and the Rebirth of Planetary Astronomy. I do 
want to mention some other stuff. Now, the former

12:43.721 --> 12:52.051
Soviet Union had a huge program in science and 
everything, and a huge space program and so forth.

12:52.071 --> 13:06.409
But they never... As Gerard de Bacalura said, 
they'd take a telescope this small, holding his

12:52.071 --> 13:06.409
fingers a centimeter apart, and get an image this 
small, holding his fingers a millimeter apart,

12:52.071 --> 13:06.409
take an equation this long, holding his... hands a 
yard apart, and get a wrong result. Now, it seems to

13:10.139 --> 13:17.130
me they had the highest ratio of effort to results 
that I've ever heard of in any field of science.

13:17.290 --> 13:18.592
What's your view about that? Is that true? And if 
so, why? Well, let me try to answer that with a

13:21.036 --> 13:28.989
specific focus on the near-infrared, which is my 
primary area of expertise. As I indicated before,

13:29.550 --> 13:33.797
I went to Moscow in the first place because Moroz 
had a detector and a spectrometer comparable to

13:34.132 --> 13:37.335
what Kuiper had. And this involved a lead sulfide 
single element detector that was attached to a

13:38.276 --> 13:54.331
spectrometer working in the lead sulfide region, 
that is, lead sulfide cooled with dry ice or

13:38.276 --> 13:54.331
nitrogen and operating out to about two and a half 
or three microns. Now, I'm told that the way the

13:54.931 --> 14:04.020
Russians got that lead sulfide detector is that in 
earlier years when the Russians were friends with

13:54.931 --> 14:04.020
the Chinese, that the Chinese had come upon an 
American rocket with a heat seeking guidance

14:04.523 --> 14:10.869
system. And that heat seeking, this was probably 
aftermath of the Korean conflict, maybe during

14:11.489 --> 14:17.495
the Korean conflict. But anyway, the Chinese gave 
this rocket sensing device to the Russians, their

14:17.515 --> 14:23.640
friends. The Russians took it apart, discovered 
that it was a lead sulfide detector, and proceeded

14:24.241 --> 14:32.708
to analyze it in such a way that they could make one 
themselves. An entire institute of probably

14:33.143 --> 14:43.113
greater than 100 people was assigned this task, 
and they, in fact, did make lead sulfide detectors

14:33.143 --> 14:43.113
of comparable quality. A couple of these found 
their way into the hands of scientists, Moreau's

14:43.734 --> 14:54.344
in particular, and he was able to exploit it for 
scientific use. As I'm told, this story, this

14:54.364 --> 14:59.269
particular science institute was This was 
essentially their only task, was to deal with this

14:59.620 --> 15:03.665
one detector system. And after several years of 
working, continuing on it, they got so entrenched

15:04.346 --> 15:15.560
and ingrown and inbred that they even lost the 
technique themselves. And after they had had this

15:16.121 --> 15:20.046
initial success, they couldn't do it anymore. Yet 
the Institute and all the personnel stayed intact

15:20.266 --> 15:28.497
and proceeded down their merry way because 
apparently nobody called them off and told them to

15:20.266 --> 15:28.497
go do something else. So that was apparently the 
apex, the culmination of Russian near-infrared

15:29.033 --> 15:39.866
detector development. And to my understanding, 
it never got any better. And they were never able,

15:42.610 --> 15:51.520
after that initial success, to keep up with 
Western achievements, Western developments in

15:42.610 --> 15:51.520
detector development. Let's go back to GPK now. He 
was on the Project Alsos mission, which everyone

15:55.122 --> 16:05.960
always confused with Operation Paperclip, but 
Alsos went in with the combat troops sometimes

15:55.122 --> 16:05.960
ahead of them. And that's where I understand that 
GPK picked up the infrared technology that he

16:06.080 --> 16:10.928
used. Well, I think that's not entirely correct. 
It's related. Kuiper was working on Alsos to

16:14.815 --> 16:19.122
evaluate German technological achievements and 
developments and so on. And that story is very

16:23.656 --> 16:28.742
nicely told in David Dvorkin's book, by the way, 
the 1992 book. Which is entitled? I've forgotten.

16:31.947 --> 16:34.791
It's something about the German vengeance weapon 
or something of the kind. It's an excellent book

16:34.831 --> 16:40.638
and a very nice little piece, well referenced 
about Kuiper's involvement with Alsace. In any

16:40.659 --> 16:49.210
case, Kuiper's academic colleague, Robert 
Cashman, in the United States, was the American

16:40.659 --> 16:49.210
developer of of the lead sulfide detectors. And 
Cashman worked with Kuiper or vice versa to

16:52.164 --> 17:10.062
produce one of these things after they were 
declassified, just following the war, to produce

16:52.164 --> 17:10.062
one of these things for use in an astronomical 
spectrometer at the McDonald Observatory. What

17:11.924 --> 17:18.150
Kuiper learned about German detector 
development, I don't know in detail, but I think he

17:11.924 --> 17:18.150
found that they were close on the heels or perhaps 
even a little bit better at these near-infrared

17:18.468 --> 17:24.739
detectors than the Americans were. The details of 
that I'm not certain about. But the upshot of it in

17:27.063 --> 17:40.246
terms of his ability to have a detector and begin 
this pioneering work in near-infrared

17:27.063 --> 17:40.246
spectroscopy, both in stellar and planetary 
work, came from his association with Cashman. And

17:41.067 --> 17:43.311
Cashman's A brief obituary of Cashman appeared 
not long ago in Physics Today, where there's a

17:43.814 --> 17:52.606
brief assessment of his work on these 
near-infrared detectors. The association with

17:54.448 --> 18:03.700
Cashman, as I say, produced a detector, one of 
which, by the way, is now in the collection at the

17:54.448 --> 18:03.700
National Air and Space Museum. I managed to 
salvage this from Kuiper's collection of

18:04.321 --> 18:12.792
memorabilia, and it was donated to the museum a 
couple of years ago. So they have it, one of the very

18:13.548 --> 18:18.836
ones that was used in the original spectrometer 
that Kuiper used. Now, Kuiper was, and I know this

18:18.996 --> 18:28.611
because I funded him when I was at headquarters, 
was the guy that first realized what a great site

18:18.996 --> 18:28.611
Mauna Kea was. But he got frozen out of it. What do 
you know about that? The story of Kuiper's

18:35.041 --> 18:42.272
association with Mauna Kea is rather accurately 
told in the... two lengthy editorials by Mitch

18:42.556 --> 18:45.799
Waldrop in Science. And these appeared roughly 10 
years ago. I can't remember exactly. It's a

18:51.065 --> 18:52.286
complex story. Some of the details, I think, are 
forever obscure because they relate to Kuiper's

18:53.507 --> 18:58.613
feelings about it. Essentially, Kuiper 
recognized the potential of Mauna Kea, dealt

18:59.614 --> 19:08.563
directly with the governor of the state of Hawaii, 
John Burns, who received him very well and who

19:09.067 --> 19:14.875
supported the initial site surveys at Mauna Kea. 
At the same time, however, the University of

19:15.516 --> 19:28.535
Hawaii was trying to build a program in astronomy, 
primarily in solar astronomy as a follow-on to the

19:15.516 --> 19:28.535
International Geophysical Year, which had taken 
place in 1957-58. There was work on aurora and,

19:29.496 --> 19:35.445
again, on the sun done on Haleakalā, And this work 
was done through the University of Hawaii. Well,

19:40.003 --> 19:48.373
they hired a solar astronomer, John T. Jeffries, 
who brought with him an entourage of solar

19:40.003 --> 19:48.373
physicists from Boulder, Colorado. And they 
began this program of solar work. Well, they

19:51.476 --> 20:03.070
decided that while Kuiper was busily working with 
the governor of Hawaii to assess the qualities of

19:51.476 --> 20:03.070
Mauna Kea for nighttime astronomy, NASA 
solicited proposals for a major optical

20:03.404 --> 20:08.929
telescope on Mauna Kea. Kuiper, with the 
assistance of Harold Johnson, also in Tucson,

20:08.949 --> 20:14.494
naturally put in a proposal to do this. But NASA 
didn't want a single proposal because it was

20:15.334 --> 20:20.239
clearly non-competitive. So they solicited 
proposals from other agencies or other

20:20.619 --> 20:31.909
universities and were given proposals by Harvard 
University and also by the University of Hawaii.

20:32.632 --> 20:43.121
John Jeffries, sort of on last minute, put 
together this proposal to go in, in parallel with

20:32.632 --> 20:43.121
Kuiper's proposal to NASA for a telescope there. 
After these proposals were evaluated, the choice

20:44.443 --> 20:50.148
was made to go with the University of Hawaii. And 
William Brunk tells me, who was in the driver's

20:50.768 --> 21:00.597
seat at that time, that they, at NASA 
headquarters, felt that Kuiper was

20:50.768 --> 21:00.597
overextended. He had too many irons in the fire at 
various places around the world, and they felt

21:01.015 --> 21:13.986
that John Jeffries and his solar crew, while more 
or less unproven for nighttime astronomy, should

21:01.015 --> 21:13.986
be given the opportunity to do it. They were on the 
site, they were there, and should be given the

21:14.086 --> 21:20.472
opportunity, Kuiper being overextended. The 
Harvard proposal, apparently, was not very

21:21.033 --> 21:23.835
competitive. That was Menzel's. That's right. 
I'll tell you, since I'm writing a book, I can say

21:26.497 --> 21:29.520
anything I want. Brunk was new. He never did have 
any track record as a scientist. Nancy Roman told

21:37.681 --> 21:46.792
me personally before I left headquarters that 
Kuiper would have a telescope on Mauna Kea over her

21:37.681 --> 21:46.792
dead body. Nancy Roman's involvement is an 
element that I really don't know anything about.

21:53.099 --> 21:55.482
Let me ask you something on a related matter. 
Kuiper left the directorship of Yerkes and

21:57.766 --> 22:16.769
McDonald rather suddenly, and in fact,

21:57.766 --> 22:16.769
Frank Edmondson keeps telling me, although I've 
never seen any proof, but he says he's got

21:57.766 --> 22:16.769
documentary proof that Kuiper was summarily 
fired as director of Yerkes and McDonald. What do

22:16.789 --> 22:18.531
you know about that? I would have to refer to my 
notes on that. I've been in touch with Frank

22:20.333 --> 22:25.579
Edmondson about this and with various other 
people as well, and As I was putting together the

22:25.880 --> 22:44.604
manuscript for my biographical memoir on Kuiper 
that will soon be published by the National

22:25.880 --> 22:44.604
Academy, I was fully convinced that this 
assertion is true and that Kuiper was forced to

22:25.880 --> 22:44.604
step down. And I would have to refer to my notes and 
sources to recall the exact circumstances. on

22:51.108 --> 22:57.557
that, and I have agreed already to provide that to 
you, Ron, so that you can consider that. You're on

22:57.577 --> 22:58.538
the record now. Sure. Let me ask you a personal 
question. Because GPK obviously is a key player in

23:02.363 --> 23:10.495
the rebirth of planetary astronomy, and I can't 
interview him. What was he like? Kriper was a very

23:12.237 --> 23:20.288
intense personality, a very imposing figure 
physically, and an absolutely domineering

23:20.977 --> 23:25.703
character intellectually. He had a profound 
effect on my life, certainly at the professional

23:27.165 --> 23:36.897
level, but as the years go by, I see he had a profound 
effect on my life in a personal sense, too. There

23:37.758 --> 23:43.746
are other people upon whose lives he has had 
similar profound influences, and Tom Geralds is

23:37.758 --> 23:43.746
one such. Tom Geralds and I have, over the last many 
years, talked a lot, written a lot to one another,

23:48.145 --> 23:58.600
trying to come to grips, to reach peace with this 
effect that Kuiper has had on both of our lives.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.724
Gerholtz, of course, is a fellow Dutchman. In any 
case, and dealt with Kuiper primarily earlier on,

24:02.365 --> 24:16.785
in any event, Kuiper was a

24:02.365 --> 24:16.785
domineering individual whose intellect one 
could only respect and One evidence of that is that

24:17.356 --> 24:23.223
even essentially everyone who worked with him 
called him Dr. Kuyper. He was Gerard only to a very,

24:23.723 --> 24:30.851
very small inner circle of people who were 
essentially his contemporaries. Fred Whipple.

24:31.972 --> 24:38.920
Fred Whipple and Harold Johnson and Frank Lowe and 
those folks were able to call him Gerard, which, by

24:31.972 --> 24:38.920
the way, wasn't his real name. That's an 
Americanized version of Gerrit, which was his

24:39.261 --> 24:45.067
Dutch given name. In any case... He, on the one 
hand, was a marvelous conversationalist, had a

24:47.309 --> 24:59.403
very nice sense of humor, and was a joy to be around 
in many respects. He was extremely impatient, on

25:00.003 --> 25:09.634
the other hand, with anybody who appeared to be 
intellectually inferior to him, to have less

25:00.003 --> 25:09.634
knowledge than him, and so on. He didn't deal with 
students very well. He was very difficult to work

25:13.298 --> 25:16.422
with and to work for. His general demeanor was one 
of extreme arrogance, and it took a lot to get past

25:18.376 --> 25:31.791
that, to be able to work with him, to be able to stand 
him. But once you did, there was a lot to be derived

25:32.952 --> 25:40.140
from the association, a lot of positive things to 
be derived from the association. And for those of

25:41.182 --> 25:45.987
us who were able to get on top of that demeanor 
issue, We derived a lot of benefit from the

25:46.270 --> 25:51.115
association. Joe Chamberlain said something 
about, he was a very loyal man, and I mentioned that

25:52.056 --> 26:08.274
to Fred Whipple, and he said yes, he agreed, he said 
yes, he certainly was perhaps too loyal in some

25:52.056 --> 26:08.274
cases, but he said Gerard's main problem was he 
couldn't get along with people. That's right,

26:08.314 --> 26:11.518
that's quite right, and I think that that That 
showed up when Kuiper arrived in America around

26:12.781 --> 26:28.082
1929 or 1930 and went to the Lick Observatory as a 
postdoc, later to become a Kellogg Fellow at the

26:12.781 --> 26:28.082
Lick Observatory. I mentioned earlier Philip 
Riggs, who was the astronomer in Des Moines where I

26:28.522 --> 26:32.628
grew up. Philip Riggs was a graduate student at 
Lick Observatory when Kuiper arrived as a fresh

26:33.569 --> 26:39.237
postdoc from Holland. When I told after I spent the 
first summer at Yerkes Observatory, now in 1958,

26:41.367 --> 26:52.040
and went back to Des Moines and talked to Philip 
Riggs, who had recommended me for the job. The

26:52.361 --> 26:56.746
first thing he asked me was, has old Gerard Kuiper 
learned to get along with anybody yet? And that

26:57.587 --> 27:06.058
told me right then and there that this problem had 
arisen, and this element of Kuiper's personality

26:57.587 --> 27:06.058
showed up from day one. By the way, Phil Riggs spent 
a summer at the University of Illinois. I was his

27:09.998 --> 27:11.140
teaching assistant. Oh, is that right? That's how 
I know him. That's great. He's a wonderful man. Now

27:14.405 --> 27:19.091
let me connect Kuiper with going back now to the 
history of planetary astronomy.

27:21.996 --> 27:28.485
When you started, did you feel inferior to real 
astronomers who worked on stars and galaxies?

27:29.478 --> 27:30.520
Well, in a way, yes. And in a way, no. As I've already 
mentioned, I got my first acquaintance with real

27:32.382 --> 27:39.674
professional astronomers at Yerkes 
Observatory. And this was an extraordinary

27:40.114 --> 27:56.700
opportunity from a boy from the cornfields of Iowa 
to go to this imposing architectural structure in

27:40.114 --> 27:56.700
the farmland of Wisconsin, a place from the last 
century with gargoyles and and all that sort of

27:57.136 --> 27:58.377
thing. It was neo-Gothic right there in the middle 
of Wisconsin. The first foreigners I ever talked

28:02.603 --> 28:09.891
to, the first people with advanced degrees, 
essentially, that I ever spoke with were there at

28:02.603 --> 28:09.891
Yerkes. So this summer of 1958 was an 
extraordinary experience. Well, I say that to

28:14.537 --> 28:23.768
answer your question that, naturally, Yerkes 
Observatory was populated and dominated by

28:24.102 --> 28:32.091
classical stellar astronomers, the likes of 
Morgan, Hiltner, Abt, Chandrasekhar. S.

28:32.671 --> 28:33.512
Chandrasekhar. S. Chandrasekhar, and on and on. 
And Kuiper and his entourage of flunkies,

28:36.355 --> 28:48.669
essentially, some transports or transplants 
from England, amateur astronomers from England,

28:36.355 --> 28:48.669
and here this kid down in the darkroom rubbing 
prints with the great man himself. So Kuiper was an

28:49.870 --> 28:51.091
anomaly. His program was an anomaly. And all of us 
who were part of it were made to feel anomalous. We

28:57.389 --> 28:59.071
were, sure, treated well. I was given opportunity 
to spend evenings playing with a 40-inch

28:59.251 --> 29:05.198
telescope and so on. Yet there was this element of 
the whole thing was an amateur astronomy project.

29:10.765 --> 29:17.173
Do you think the fact that Kuiper was able to get big 
bucks out of the Air Force rankled with some of

29:10.765 --> 29:17.173
the... Oh, I think it must have, sure. Kuiper... 
The thing that I have to keep reminding myself is

29:19.081 --> 29:40.143
that when I got acquainted with Kuiper in that 
summer of 1958, the man had already done an entire

29:19.081 --> 29:40.143
career's worth of classical stellar astronomy, 
double star work, white dwarf work, and stellar

29:19.081 --> 29:40.143
spectroscopy, and done excellent work, the 
bolometric corrections and so on, some of which is

29:19.081 --> 29:40.143
still very valuable work. He had begun to pursue 
solar system work as essentially an outgrowth of

29:41.285 --> 29:48.312
his interest in binary stars and their formation 
and so on. But the man already had this strong

29:48.680 --> 29:56.208
scientific reputation before he even began to 
pursue planetary things. And as I've pointed out

29:56.729 --> 30:03.797
in my biographical memoir, his discovery of the 
atmosphere of Titan was purely an accident. He ran

30:04.017 --> 30:18.012
out of white dwarfs to take spectra of during the 
night at McDonald, and he decided to look at a few

30:04.017 --> 30:18.012
planetary objects, discovered methane on Titan, 
and that was the sort of beginning of his

30:04.017 --> 30:18.012
observational work in planetary astronomy. 
Well, anyway, that was an accident. But he was the

30:19.708 --> 30:31.244
director of Yerkes, the director of this bunch of 
stellar classical astrophysics prima donnas,

30:19.708 --> 30:31.244
who by this time had, I think, grown to loathe him. 
Yet they had to deal with him because he was the

30:32.025 --> 30:40.297
director, and he also commanded this very large 
amount of funding from an unexpected source. It

30:40.317 --> 30:47.627
wasn't, I mean, it was from a government source, 
and astronomers weren't used to that in those

30:40.317 --> 30:47.627
days, and they had no choice but to deal with him. 
this person with a richness of resources. So I

30:51.075 --> 30:57.500
think there was a resentment there that grew out of 
the jealousy over the funding. It grew out of the

30:58.201 --> 31:02.785
difficulty of his personality. When Otto Struve 
was the director, Otto was able to keep these prima

31:03.545 --> 31:14.975
donnas pretty much in harmony, just because of the 
strength of his own personality and his own

31:03.545 --> 31:14.975
managerial skills. But when Struve was gone, The 
place began to unravel, and it unraveled along a

31:17.645 --> 31:31.700
variety of lines that were related to these strong 
personalities, the diversity of scientific

31:17.645 --> 31:31.700
interests, and no doubt the jealousy over 
research funds. In your personal opinion, back

31:32.561 --> 31:46.116
around 1958, 59, 60, do you think that planetary 
astronomy was considered second-rate and

31:32.561 --> 31:46.116
inferior by the, quote, establishment? Oh, it's 
clear to me that it was, yes. As I say, my first

31:48.724 --> 31:56.232
connections with the establishment were at this 
rather peculiar place, Yerkes Observatory. But

31:56.773 --> 32:14.010
as I expanded my experiences and contacts to 
various other places in the country and other

31:56.773 --> 32:14.010
institutions, it became clearer and clearer that 
planetary science, planetary astronomy, as it

31:56.773 --> 32:14.010
was considered in those days, that's really all 
there was, was definitely regarded as inferior.

32:16.668 --> 32:34.250
And I've spent the last 30 years in some ways trying 
to understand how that came to be, and is there any

32:16.668 --> 32:34.250
way to, is there any antidote for it, or are we 
always going to be plagued with this problem as

32:16.668 --> 32:34.250
long as planetary science is identified as such? 
That brings up the next question. How do you think

32:35.712 --> 32:41.699
real, quote-unquote, astronomers think of 
planetary astronomy now? Now. I believe that the

32:44.483 --> 33:03.224
generation represented by Kuiper, and this 
includes such people as Jeff Burbage, who was a

32:44.483 --> 33:03.224
personal enemy of Kuiper, and various other 
people of that generation still have rather

32:44.483 --> 33:03.224
negative feelings about it. Let's say the people 
at what's now Mount Palomar observatory. These

33:12.363 --> 33:22.252
folks are cosmologists, primarily, and 
classical astronomers, and I'm sure they have a

33:12.363 --> 33:22.252
very dim view of the value of planetary science. 
The Mount Wilson syndrome. Yeah, right. But even

33:25.195 --> 33:30.360
in Hawaii, where we had a rather unusual 
situation. As I say, the program was just getting

33:31.661 --> 33:34.143
started in 1970. That is, the nighttime astronomy 
program was just getting started. And planetary

33:38.787 --> 33:40.850
people were already involved. Bill Sinton was 
there, David Morrison, Bob Murphy, and then I

33:40.870 --> 33:44.475
showed up in 1970. And because I know I wrote the 
funding memo, that funds were given to Hawaii,

33:45.036 --> 33:54.228
committed for a long time, that they must do 
planetary work. That's right. They must do

33:54.689 --> 33:55.870
planetary work.

33:58.714 --> 34:00.597
And that was all fine. I mean, that's why the 
telescope was built, but it was clear that it would

34:00.697 --> 34:04.322
be used for a large fraction of the time would be for 
planetary work and the remainder for classical

34:04.623 --> 34:09.990
astronomy. The point I'd like to make is that that 
program developed and grew with a complete

34:10.852 --> 34:31.440
intertwining of classical astronomers, stellar 
astronomers, and planetary people, and the

34:10.852 --> 34:31.440
outcome of that was very positive in that there was 
a mutual respect, a family atmosphere and

34:10.852 --> 34:31.440
attitude, such that we all took a lot of pleasure in 
each other's successes and discoveries. And

34:38.450 --> 34:51.546
people interested in galaxies, such as Alan 
Stockton, people interested in classical

34:38.450 --> 34:51.546
stellar spectroscopy, such as Sidney Wolfe and 
Walter Bonsack, were working side by side with

34:38.450 --> 34:51.546
those people I've already mentioned doing 
planetary work. And as we grew up together, all of

34:52.127 --> 34:57.293
us having gone there, except Bill Sinton as fairly 
young people, we developed a camaraderie and a

34:57.661 --> 35:08.457
family mood, which was very productive and very 
supportive. Before I left Hawaii, that had begun

35:09.318 --> 35:27.364
to change because John Jeffries had left, Don Hall 
had become the director, and his hiring policies

35:09.318 --> 35:27.364
had put into faculty positions there a larger 
number of cosmologists and people interested in

35:09.318 --> 35:27.364
extragalactic studies. And so the attitude 
toward planetary science, I think, even in

35:27.918 --> 35:38.833
Hawaii, had begun to shift a bit, to become a little 
less tolerant, a little less interested, and

35:27.918 --> 35:38.833
maybe a little less respectful. However, while I 
was still there, planetary astronomy had still an

35:39.835 --> 35:50.550
important role at the Institute, primarily 
because of the funding structure. Also, we had

35:51.211 --> 35:57.520
productive scientists, but there was still sort 
of a cudgel that we held in that The 88-inch

35:57.719 --> 36:16.867
telescope was still supported primarily by a 
grant from NASA Planetary Programs, and in the

35:57.719 --> 36:16.867
form of a large single grant that exceeded a 
quarter of a million dollars for a combination of

35:57.719 --> 36:16.867
support of the telescope and the support of the 
planetary research, all of which was under the

35:57.719 --> 36:16.867
single umbrella of one grant. And that structure 
broke down essentially as I left by mutual

36:17.808 --> 36:24.598
agreement with headquarters and the Institute 
for Astronomy. But at least during the years I was

36:24.978 --> 36:26.781
there, Planetary astronomy was respected, it was 
well supported, and we had a wonderful supportive

36:27.166 --> 36:35.955
arrangement with the classical stellar 
astronomers. I think that is less so now. That was

36:37.897 --> 36:40.940
one case where people actually talked to each 
other. That's right, and in friendly terms. One

36:45.185 --> 36:46.446
last thing about Kuiper. Do you think the fact that 
he was in what was considered a second-rate field

36:46.646 --> 36:56.717
reinforced his personality character, his 
negative personality characters, and gave him

36:46.646 --> 36:56.717
this embattled status? I'm not so sure. I think 
Kriper was a difficult personality to the core,

36:59.784 --> 37:23.008
and that he had an element of arrogance and 
self-assurance that allowed him to rise above or

36:59.784 --> 37:23.008
beyond the criticisms of his colleagues and 
pursue his own path with complete

36:59.784 --> 37:23.008
self-assurance. At the time, he had a good 
relationship with S. Chandrasekhar. I think they

37:28.304 --> 37:33.651
also had some difficult times, but they were in 
very different areas of science. And I think that,

37:34.372 --> 37:47.209
well, I'm not sure where I was going with that, but 
I'll just say again that I think Kuiper didn't have

37:34.372 --> 37:47.209
a siege mentality. He felt completely 
self-assured that his course was right. Now we'll

37:51.440 --> 37:58.591
get on to a different subject, and this is 
something that nothing has been written about

37:51.440 --> 37:58.591
this. And the people involved are all dead. So I've 
got to ask people's personal opinions who are in

38:02.296 --> 38:05.901
the field now. At the turn of the century, 
planetary astronomy was still a popular topic. I

38:11.369 --> 38:14.494
mean, Henry Norris Russell did stuff on Venus and 
all that. By 1920, it was not only not popular, it

38:15.031 --> 38:22.259
wasn't safe to be in what killed planetary 
astronomy. I think two people killed it. I think

38:24.561 --> 38:29.226
Percival Lowell killed it in the United States, 
and Camille Flammarion killed it in Europe.

38:29.246 --> 38:33.030
That's exactly Gerard de Vaucouleur's comment. 
Well, I haven't talked to de Vaucouleur about

38:33.050 --> 38:36.273
this, but I... It's right in this book. Good, 
great. I came to this awareness when I was

38:40.077 --> 38:43.941
researching some... work by Barnard, Edward 
Emerson Barnard, on his life and times. Barnard

38:51.162 --> 38:55.789
was a voice of reason during the Canals on Mars era. 
He was a Chautauqua series lecturer with lantern

38:57.332 --> 39:09.710
slides of pictures that he had taken, being one of 
the great pioneers of photography and astronomy,

38:57.332 --> 39:09.710
and discoverer of comets and whatnot, and the 
fifth satellite of Jupiter. He was a well-known

39:09.750 --> 39:14.417
personality, but he didn't write popular books 
and didn't have the same charisma, contacts, and

39:14.802 --> 39:19.107
persona that Percival Lowell did. Percival 
Lowell wrote numerous books on the habitability

39:19.768 --> 39:38.092
of Mars and the nature of Mars' intelligent 
civilization and all this and that, based in large

39:19.768 --> 39:38.092
part upon his observations and those of his 
colleagues under his thumb at Lowell Observatory

39:19.768 --> 39:38.092
of the canals and seasonal changes on Mars. This 
attracted a lot of attention in the popular press

39:39.213 --> 39:44.640
and lent an aura of silliness to planetary studies 
as seen by classical astronomers. What you

39:56.561 --> 40:08.198
indicated was true, that a major part of the 
program of nearly all professional astronomical

39:56.561 --> 40:08.198
observatories in the latter part of the 19th 
century was planetary work. They were doing

40:08.218 --> 40:13.767
planetary visual observations, searches for 
satellites, spectroscopy and photography, what

40:13.966 --> 40:16.849
have you. And this was a very legitimate part of 
classical astronomy at the end of the 19th

40:17.489 --> 40:24.015
century. Well, this business about the canals on 
Mars, I think, gave that an aura of science fiction

40:24.796 --> 40:39.189
and that primarily the efforts and the charisma of 
Percival Lowell in this country did it. I believe,

40:39.870 --> 40:42.032
although I'm not as well acquainted with it, that 
parallel activity in Europe by Flammarion, with,

40:42.367 --> 40:53.224
again, a volley of popular books and articles, 
produced essentially the same effect there.

40:55.047 --> 40:58.753
What's the best piece of work you've done in 
astronomy? The best piece of work I've done is

40:58.773 --> 41:10.011
probably the work on the spectrum of Neptune's 
satellite, Triton, in which persistence in

41:11.020 --> 41:32.709
Studying the near-infrared spectrum produced 
the detection and identification of methane,

41:11.020 --> 41:32.709
frozen methane on Triton, and frozen nitrogen, 
which we now recognize as the dominant material on

41:11.020 --> 41:32.709
the surface of Triton and Pluto. I continue to 
pursue this as the technology permits us to do a

41:34.070 --> 41:39.137
better and better job. Now, in 1989, of course, 
Voyager flew by Triton and found some very

41:39.708 --> 41:51.962
interesting things and corroborated the 
presence of nitrogen and methane, but it didn't

41:39.708 --> 41:51.962
show anything else. And in the meantime, we've 
found from additional ground-based work, carbon

41:52.223 --> 42:04.497
dioxide and carbon monoxide ices on Triton, and 
evidence of some other very interesting

41:52.223 --> 42:04.497
hydrocarbons, which we haven't even yet 
announced. So it turns out that the persistence in

42:05.959 --> 42:08.922
trying to detect, measure, and interpret the 
spectrum of a little object, 30 astronomical

42:09.458 --> 42:38.267
units from the sun, something that has a 
temperature in the neighborhood of less than 40

42:09.458 --> 42:38.267
Kelvin and is to the telescope only almost 14th 
magnitude, has proven to be a very, very rich

42:09.458 --> 42:38.267
spectrum, which we continue to interpret and find 
extremely interesting chemistry and

42:09.458 --> 42:38.267
information on the early development of the solar 
system. What did you have the most fun doing so far?

42:42.065 --> 42:45.508
Well, certainly the work on nitrogen has been some 
of the most fun. I also had an enormous amount of fun

42:46.349 --> 42:54.396
with our 20-micron detections of faint objects in 
the solar system. And I remember very well

42:55.117 --> 43:07.748
standing on the Cassegrain platform in the cold at 
the 88-inch telescope in Hawaii in the mid-'70s,

42:55.117 --> 43:07.748
measuring the thermal radiation from Trojan 
asteroids at 20 microns. These are objects which

43:09.394 --> 43:13.298
had never been detected thermally before. And I 
was able to get the first measurements of heat from

43:13.338 --> 43:21.668
those dark, small, little objects. And by the way, 
the detection of heat itself indicated that they

43:22.129 --> 43:29.057
were dark objects which absorbed a lot of sunlight 
and had low albedos. Similarly, with two of the

43:29.698 --> 43:34.343
outer satellites of Jupiter, I knew what I was 
looking for. I knew that if I could detect them at

43:34.610 --> 43:39.117
all that that meant they were little black 
objects. Standing there on the platform seeing

43:39.618 --> 43:46.909
the strip chart recorder make a positive 
detection was a tremendous thrill. Have you had

43:48.131 --> 43:50.054
any fiascos or dead ends? Oh, sure. I've had some 
mistakes. What's your greatest fiasco? Well, I'd

43:53.560 --> 44:01.512
preface this by saying that I've enjoyed being on 
what is a cutting edge of detections and

44:01.863 --> 44:05.788
measurements in planetary astronomy. And when 
you're on an edge, you can fall sometimes on one

44:06.530 --> 44:11.577
side and fall sometimes on the other. I've already 
told you about the successes in which I fell on the

44:12.157 --> 44:16.924
right side of the edge. There have been a couple of 
failures where I've fallen on the other side.

44:20.869 --> 44:29.862
Probably the worst one was the apparent detection 
of helium emission in the spectrum of Io,

44:20.869 --> 44:29.862
Jupiter's satellite Io. We in Hawaii, one of the 
first things I did there was to work on a

44:30.787 --> 44:37.493
near-infrared Fourier transform spectrometer. 
And one of the first things we looked at with this

44:38.394 --> 44:51.645
spectrometer after we finally got it online with 
the 88-inch telescope was IO, by which time sodium

44:38.394 --> 44:51.645
emission had already been detected in the 
spectrum by Robert Brown and colleagues. But we

44:51.665 --> 44:53.407
looked at it, and we detected this. We, that is with 
Carl Pilcher and Bill Sinton, we detected helium

44:53.567 --> 45:00.253
emission, the 10-8-30 band or line of helium We 
rushed to a meeting that was held in Ithaca and

45:00.807 --> 45:11.798
reported this and sent out an IAU circular on it, 
and Don Hunton congratulated us on the detection

45:00.807 --> 45:11.798
of helium emission. No one understood what it 
meant, but they were all willing to believe that

45:11.858 --> 45:19.885
this very peculiar object had helium emission, 
and we all set out to understand it. And then we

45:20.386 --> 45:30.055
discovered that this was spurious because the 
interferometer control system used a helium lamp

45:31.250 --> 45:34.195
to provide the clocking frequency. And while we 
could not imagine how this Spirius signal got into

45:35.117 --> 45:41.529
the signal chain, indeed it did. And our detection 
of helium on Io was wrong. And Larry Trafton

45:45.476 --> 45:52.749
continues to remind me of that, even though the 
rest of the world until this very moment has

45:45.476 --> 45:52.749
forgotten, mercifully forgotten. If you read any 
of the popular books about exploration of the

45:56.005 --> 46:01.656
solar system that have been coming out in the last 
20 years. It's all done by the space probes. Of

46:03.800 --> 46:04.181
course. What's your opinion? My opinion is that 
the space probes wouldn't have even known where to

46:06.666 --> 46:11.736
go or what to look at.
