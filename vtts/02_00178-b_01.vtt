WEBVTT

00:04.064 --> 00:12.834
Do you remember in the 70s any important proposal 
that you sent forward that got turned down?

00:15.597 --> 00:16.738
No, I really don't. Because what I always tried to 
do is when I went up with something, I always tried

00:18.340 --> 00:29.432
to have my P's and Q's in order and justification 
and all like this. And I think that's one of the

00:29.733 --> 00:33.497
advantages. of having the grounds report to a VP in 
that you have an opportunity, you live or die by

00:34.388 --> 00:44.139
what you say and what you do. During that period did 
any, as far as you know, any board member or other

00:46.062 --> 00:56.734
former student or legislator or anybody get 
involved with second guessing any of these

00:46.062 --> 00:56.734
things?

00:59.778 --> 01:00.098
No. The only time We built a driving range for Bob 
Ellis. For who? Bob Ellis, golf coach. This was

01:10.961 --> 01:15.507
out, well, it was where the bonfire site is now. And 
Bob had saved money from his golf school. Well, I'd

01:20.234 --> 01:27.283
gotten some, arranged to get some fill to build up 
the tee, and he had some targets out there for more

01:20.234 --> 01:27.283
of the projects. Anyway, Bob didn't, it what 
turned out he didn't have quite enough money and we

01:31.392 --> 01:54.852
went ahead and finished up some of it out of out of my 
budget wasn't you know a couple thousand dollars

01:31.392 --> 01:54.852
wasn't that big a deal and then Bob I can't remember 
who the board member was he was from Corpus Christi

01:31.392 --> 01:54.852
I think Tony Fells yeah I think that Tony Hilton I 
think that's who it was maybe Maybe not, anyway.

01:57.574 --> 02:06.571
And so they were at some kind of a luncheon and he sat 
by Bob and he said, got any problems? And Bob, I

02:06.591 --> 02:14.005
don't know whether he realized what we'd done or 
not, but anyway. He said, yeah, I'm having a little

02:14.407 --> 02:17.052
problem with my driving range. Can't seem to get 
anything done. Next thing I knew, I was in Howard's

02:18.435 --> 02:20.118
office. And I said, hey. And I showed Howard what 
we'd done. He said, well, there shouldn't be a

02:24.567 --> 02:25.890
problem. So I went down and I talked to Bob. And what 
had happened, he had mentioned some things and it

02:28.355 --> 02:34.407
was taken out of context. And it created a little 
consternation. Bob and I had a nice long, we're

02:40.002 --> 02:45.348
good friends, we had a nice long talk and it all 
worked out. But that's the only time that I can ever

02:45.368 --> 02:55.679
remember that really some direct action from 
something from a board member got down.

02:58.482 --> 02:59.784
Trying to think of anything else. Did the area 
around the MSC board quarters Did they require

03:04.373 --> 03:06.216
special attention? And or that kind of courtyard? 
No, that was one of what we called our Class A areas.

03:16.293 --> 03:20.340
And we tried to, I don't think we ever had a real 
problem with that area because we had, by then we'd

03:21.198 --> 03:40.502
set up what we call a garden area system where I had, 
and we ultimately wound up with I think 26

03:21.198 --> 03:40.502
gardening areas on campus where that person had 
did everything in that given area except the large

03:21.198 --> 03:40.502
area mowing, the tree work, and this kind of thing. 
And that was theirs. And they took a lot of pride in

03:42.764 --> 03:44.607
that. What would be some other examples? Of 
gardening areas?

03:51.218 --> 03:58.607
Well, like the central area library, we'd have 
probably had a gardener in each of the dormitory

03:51.218 --> 03:58.607
areas. And what we tried to do is we did an analysis. 
Now the MSC and Rudder was a little different story

04:04.674 --> 04:13.504
because we had one gardener for that area because 
of what it was, where it was and who was there, that

04:04.674 --> 04:13.504
kind of thing. We had a gardener for the two 
residences on campus. And like the

04:20.547 --> 04:36.450
administration building now, and a couple of 
buildings on either side of that, what we call the

04:20.547 --> 04:36.450
engineering block, that was broken up probably 
into a couple of gardeners. But that worked very

04:38.092 --> 04:42.218
well because they knew where they were going to go 
every day. And they knew that their foreman and

04:43.058 --> 04:49.007
supervisor would be checking with them, you know, 
if they had any problem, they needed to raise it.

04:49.027 --> 04:52.352
And it worked extremely well. But talking about 
the MSC and board quarters area, we never really

04:52.473 --> 05:00.866
had a problem with that. I don't recall because 
never got any real complaints. Oh, we might have a

05:04.051 --> 05:05.172
complaint. We had a little litter. and they 
hadn't, the gardener hadn't quite worked around,

05:06.194 --> 05:14.443
you know, or something like this, but it was 
usually, usually fairly minor. I'd get a call from

05:15.063 --> 05:17.085
Bob Cherry, I guess. President's House. You're 
all responsible for gardens around there. Yes.

05:25.114 --> 05:29.118
Which of the president's wives was the most 
pleasant to work with? I'm not going to ask the

05:31.761 --> 05:33.062
negative.

05:36.282 --> 05:43.572
We

05:36.282 --> 05:43.572
never really had much of a problem. Ms. Williams 
was usually the most outspoken, and that was

05:44.714 --> 05:57.953
because I think she was used to dealing with Bob, 
you know, because they had a very, very close

05:44.714 --> 05:57.953
relationship.

06:01.088 --> 06:18.036
I don't think, I know one time when Jarvis Miller 
was president, he called Howard and said, they're

06:01.088 --> 06:18.036
killing my trees. And we had several small red oaks 
out in And with our water, the kind of sprinklers

06:22.604 --> 06:41.430
that we had to cover the large areas, and with 
particularly red oaks, and you get a summer like

06:22.604 --> 06:41.430
we've had now and you're watering a lot, you get a, 
what Goldwater and I call a sprinkler arc, burn for

06:22.604 --> 06:41.430
the trees. And he said, they've done something, 
they're burning the leaves. And I said, Howard,

06:43.633 --> 06:48.340
now that's not what Jarvis says. And I said, well, 
in all due respect, he's wrong. And then I got a call

06:53.097 --> 06:57.902
the next day, and he said, you've got to do 
something with the dang trees. I said, Howard, I

06:58.943 --> 07:01.105
don't know what we can do. So we went out, and I think 
we finally picked some leaves off the trees or

07:01.705 --> 07:05.849
something like this. And fortunately, it started 
raining. And that solved the problem. But that's

07:10.153 --> 07:13.677
one of the only real problems that we ever had. 
Which of the president's wives do you think was the

07:14.778 --> 07:21.484
most interested in the shrubs, trees, plants, 
flowers. Was there any that were particularly

07:25.487 --> 07:30.593
interested in agriculture and floriculture? 
Yeah, Ms. Williams was very interested.

07:36.700 --> 07:44.569
And, you know,

07:36.700 --> 07:44.569
Ms. Banver was to some degree She was probably the 
second, I guess the second most interested, I

07:46.642 --> 08:03.558
think, but the rest of them were always usually 
very appreciative of what you did, you know.

08:03.578 --> 08:06.421
Right, type is the, what I'm about to say doesn't 
need to go in. It's not unusual, but I'm just

08:06.521 --> 08:11.966
sharing this as an information item. When the 
Williams building the old uh system building when

08:15.346 --> 08:43.446
it was named in honor of dr williams mrs williams 
was not here and the reason she wasn't here is

08:15.346 --> 08:43.446
because on thursday before the saturday 
dedication she was on the back porch of her house

08:15.346 --> 08:43.446
which is now glassed in changing a fluorescent 
bowl on a little step ladder and she had placed it in

08:44.708 --> 09:12.572
such a fashion so she would be careful not to damage 
one of her orchids she had a whole bunch of okay and

08:44.708 --> 09:12.572
then leaning out to do that she fell off the little 
uh stepladder and broke her leg my word so

08:44.708 --> 09:12.572
horticulture had an indirect uh cause for her not 
to be there in hindsight, one of the unfortunate

09:13.143 --> 09:20.955
items that day is nobody said why she couldn't be 
there. They just, because each speaker thought

09:22.477 --> 09:29.948
that somebody else would explain it, or the 
audience, everybody knew. Many people walked

09:30.869 --> 09:35.957
away thinking she wasn't there because she was 
still miffed at the campus. That's what I thought

09:37.920 --> 09:42.947
when I read she wasn't there.

09:43.535 --> 09:56.150
I told her about that omission later when I 
interviewed her, and she said, oh my, she said, I

09:43.535 --> 09:56.150
did promise Jack that I would never ever set foot on 
the campus again, not long before he died. But she

09:56.250 --> 09:57.712
said, I'm beyond that now. I've got it. And she was 
here not long ago. Oh, she was? Yeah. She said, I've

10:02.618 --> 10:04.520
grown up. I've gotten better than that now. Well, 
time heals. Did you all have the responsibility

10:09.747 --> 10:12.630
for providing flowers and so forth for various 
social events? Yes. Oh, that's got to be special.

10:19.582 --> 10:23.747
Describe some of the pluses and minuses of those 
events. There must be some that stand out. All the

10:25.850 --> 10:31.658
building dedications and things like this. I do 
remember one time we were dedicating the, what was

10:32.019 --> 10:41.892
then the new part of the Sterling Evans Library.

10:44.605 --> 10:50.818
And I think it

10:44.605 --> 10:50.818
also fell on a Baylor football game day. But we 
supplied all the podium flowers and the

10:53.060 --> 11:04.190
decorations, the greenery and everything for the 
stage and whatnot like that. And so we had just

11:04.450 --> 11:08.874
gotten everything set up good. This was probably 9 
o'clock in the morning. And Steve Hodge was out

11:11.897 --> 11:15.440
with all of his people. They usually did the stage 
and set up the sound. And we got to the point where we

11:18.683 --> 11:23.067
worked very closely with each other and learned to 
stay out of each other's way. and a cold front hit

11:23.047 --> 11:52.969
with all kinds of fury, driving rain and all like 
this, and we had to pick everything up and move it

11:23.047 --> 11:52.969
into, and there was a huge long hallway in the 
building, and that's where we moved everything,

11:23.047 --> 11:52.969
and I think they ultimately had the dedication 
maybe there, as I recall, but I remember Jack

11:23.047 --> 11:52.969
Williamson, that's the last time we were having 
one outside, and that lasted for a long, long time,

11:23.047 --> 11:52.969
you know, But, no, we did, as long as we had ample 
notice, where we could do the planning and all like

11:53.658 --> 12:05.511
this, there usually wasn't that much of a problem. 
It was just something that we worked at and we did.

12:08.375 --> 12:20.388
And basically because of my working with Bob and 
his floral background, it worked out. We didn't

12:21.049 --> 12:21.910
have any problems. Which president was most 
thoughtful in expressing appreciation for the

12:22.177 --> 12:27.348
work y'all did?

12:32.198 --> 12:32.759
Well, I don't know. I

12:33.120 --> 12:43.020
got nice comments from just about every 
president. Uh, Jarvis Miller was always very

12:44.435 --> 12:47.358
complimentary. Uh, Dr. Williams was 
complimentary too. Uh, and Vandiver, uh, you

12:50.562 --> 12:57.130
know, they, uh, can't remember. Oh, gosh.

13:05.059 --> 13:13.328
No, we, we always seem to have, uh, the presence 
always seemed to be very, very complimentary. of

13:14.303 --> 13:15.025
what we did. Were there any sudden or obvious 
budget changes, for better or for worse? In the

13:28.615 --> 13:32.143
early 80s, probably 80 or 81. the coordinating 
board said, we're going to have to reduce the

13:33.659 --> 13:42.971
ground formulas behind him, but we'll make it up 
next by him. And they cut it another 10%, you know,

13:44.033 --> 13:47.537
and it kept going. We had a, um, and I don't remember 
the specific numbers, but we had a,

13:48.258 --> 14:01.135
um, and Paul, the justification line on the state 
budget, um, acreage per person ratio. And at that

14:05.414 --> 14:12.142
point in time, it was like one person per every six 
or seven acres.

14:15.245 --> 14:24.335
And that has degenerated until I think now it's 
about one per every 15 or 16 acres. And I'm assuming

14:25.636 --> 14:29.080
compared to all the other schools in the state, Our 
ratio would have been the most extreme. Probably,

14:38.453 --> 14:41.977
because of just the sheer area that we had. Ours and 
Tech would have probably been fairly comparable.

14:46.543 --> 14:52.230
And therefore the funding would have been less per 
acre. Per acre, because we didn't have as many.

14:56.075 --> 14:57.577
There were several ingredients. There were 
linear perimeter building feet, And they were

15:00.278 --> 15:08.072
acres of public areas, which included acreage of 
public and maintained areas. That's what it was.

15:09.174 --> 15:13.201
Streets, sidewalks, turf areas, this kind of 
thing. And then there was a wage and business

15:13.221 --> 15:25.442
national survey, a wage and business multiplier 
that's set for the southwest area, I think. than a

15:26.418 --> 15:30.304
student enrollment or a headcount factor in 
there. And the formula, I thought, really worked

15:31.305 --> 15:34.490
pretty good. We never got 100% of it. The most we 
ever got was about 90%. And I got to thinking in the

15:40.339 --> 15:49.112
later 80s, if we had 90% of the formula, there's not 
much of anything we couldn't do. And as far as you

15:51.476 --> 15:55.682
were aware, the formula was comparatively 
equitable in the way it was calculated. Yeah. That

16:02.596 --> 16:05.340
it did take in the appropriate factors. Oh yeah, 
yeah. When they first started, they had so many

16:06.842 --> 16:16.455
things in it that it was hard, it was just too 
cumbersome. And so they brought it back down to

16:17.397 --> 16:25.888
linear perimeter feet, and I tried my best to get 
the Northgate wall and and all like that. Tom

16:27.116 --> 16:33.785
Cherry agreed with me, but they wouldn't accept it 
because you've got two sides to maintain,

16:27.116 --> 16:33.785
essentially a long linear building. They kind of 
saw through that one, I think. But it was worth a

16:37.871 --> 16:39.713
try. As far as you were aware, which public 
four-year school in Texas, leave A&M out of the

16:40.715 --> 16:56.196
competition, which other school would you give 
the highest marks to for their grounds? I don't

16:56.902 --> 17:00.833
know, it's been a while since I've been to any of 
them. Tech has always done a pretty good job. UT has

17:11.212 --> 17:14.576
It's so crowded it's hard to say anything. 
Southwest Texas does a real good job. Allen Goldap

17:20.003 --> 17:33.601
over there I've known for years and years and years 
and they do a good job and I haven't been to the

17:20.003 --> 17:33.601
University of Houston in oh mercy 20 years I guess 
but. All right as we go through the 80s do things get

17:33.621 --> 17:38.227
better or worse? Oh they get a little bit better in a 
sense. We were able to get some, and I'm not sure

17:44.932 --> 18:05.417
where the money came from, some local 
appropriations, I guess, too, because at one

17:44.932 --> 18:05.417
point in time, in the 80s, see, we started picking 
up a lot of the west campus areas, you know,

17:44.932 --> 18:05.417
horticulture, medical science, that kind of 
thing the and in the later 80s Easterwood Airport

18:05.397 --> 18:22.545
the terminal building there's a number of acres 
there that's public public areas and

18:24.128 --> 18:39.795
We were able to, and then we had to pick up the corner 
markers at University in Texas and George Bush in

18:24.128 --> 18:39.795
Texas, and those add quite a bit. And then the 
modular dorms came on. All that came on about kind

18:44.395 --> 18:45.657
of about the same time. And one of the biggest 
problems we had back in the early 80s, this had to

18:47.159 --> 19:02.581
have been in 83 and 84, because we had such a 
monstrous coal spill in December of 83, we could

18:47.159 --> 19:02.581
not get plant material to do horticulture.

19:05.946 --> 19:07.148
It simply wasn't available. It had frozen. See, we 
had a... about 10 days. No, it was about a week, I

19:17.623 --> 19:21.869
guess, that the temperature didn't get above 
freezing here. And that's just terrible here. I

19:25.093 --> 19:27.036
mean, as you well know. Are you inferring that you 
all had plant material in the greenhouses you were

19:28.098 --> 19:33.505
growing? No, we were having to buy the woody stuff, 
and the nurseries, you know, were, because most

19:33.653 --> 19:57.687
nurseries had gone to containers, not buckets up 
above the ground, and nobody was prepared for it,

19:33.653 --> 19:57.687
because the temperature started falling when we 
left for Christmas break that day, and it went

19:33.653 --> 19:57.687
down, and it stayed down. far well into almost New 
Year's, I guess. Well, it was cold. But it took a

20:07.491 --> 20:10.254
while to catch up from that. But we determined that 
we did a survey and inventory. And we determined

20:16.141 --> 20:24.010
that we probably had a half million dollars of 
woody plant damage campus wide. Maybe it was

20:25.352 --> 20:29.817
closer to 600,000, but it was

20:31.518 --> 20:35.791
a lot of damaged plants. Down through the years 
that you've been here, did you all attempt to grow

20:36.694 --> 20:45.139
any of your own plant material? We grew a lot of the 
small stuff, the ground covers and things of this

20:45.642 --> 20:54.115
nature. We grew all of our annuals. I'm not sure 
what they do now because, well, that's been scaled

20:56.499 --> 21:03.891
back so, but all of our annuals we grew. Where were 
the greenhouses? They were out at the Henson Park

21:05.974 --> 21:09.639
grounds area. In fact, they're still there, I 
think.

21:14.043 --> 21:19.834
But, and we used to grow a few small trees in 
containers. We would order what we call liners,

21:19.934 --> 21:27.188
one- and two-year-old trees, and containerize 
them. And that gave us a lot of material where we

21:27.209 --> 21:35.224
had, we'd have an area that needed something and it 
was not very, uh... not very costly to do that and we

21:35.744 --> 21:51.542
could put out a few you know get them up four five six 
feet where they could kind of defend themselves

21:35.744 --> 21:51.542
and uh... that's where a lot of the trees like that 
came from I know for instance the crape myrtles

21:51.522 --> 22:00.615
that line New Main Drive coming around, we bought 
those as small liners and grew them for two years

21:51.522 --> 22:00.615
and bought two different groups. We planted the 
first group up to the curve and then around the

22:00.635 --> 22:07.165
curve the second year. And it took about four years 
to do all that. Did anybody in a position of

22:12.974 --> 22:20.685
authority at any level ever give any indication of 
any favorite or unfavorite annuals? Grow more of

22:27.048 --> 22:28.771
these and less of those? No, not really. The only 
time we ever really had a problem is with the system

22:30.393 --> 22:38.003
or the administration building bed. And we used to 
try to crop areas like that at least twice a year,

22:38.965 --> 22:45.394
sometimes three times a year. And particularly 
when commencement was a little later than what it

22:52.627 --> 23:14.567
is we could never get the pansies there and we'd 
have to tear them out or on some other beds on campus

22:52.627 --> 23:14.567
too you know you you you do all your planning you 
grow the plants and maybe you have an extended

22:52.627 --> 23:14.567
season or something like this and these are not too 
bad they're still pretty good but these need to

23:14.935 --> 23:44.470
have need they they need home and oh I'd get calls 
why in the world are you taking out these good

23:14.935 --> 23:44.470
plants you know and I'd try to very patiently go 
through the explanation of why well that still

23:14.935 --> 23:44.470
doesn't make sense well you know it could turn off 
real hot and it'd be gone in 30 minutes you know and

23:14.935 --> 23:44.470
uh but uh that's the only only problem we've ever 
really had I think with annuals who made the the

23:44.804 --> 23:47.827
specific decision of which annuals where? That 
was kind of a community thing between Bill

23:48.849 --> 24:00.081
Vitapil, myself, and whoever was working under 
Bill in the greenhouses. We'd sit down and we at one

24:00.722 --> 24:12.415
point in time we had all of our annual beds and we had 
a kind of set rotation of different crops because

24:00.722 --> 24:12.415
we tried generally never to follow one crop was the 
same thing. You know, like petunias, we would not

24:16.743 --> 24:29.794
plant those probably for two years just because of 
inherent disease problems that you could get. Did

24:29.814 --> 24:33.758
you have any favorites? Oh, yeah. No, Janet would 
get it. She's back. What's your favorite? Oh, I

24:39.443 --> 24:41.845
like the pansies for winter. Calendulas are good. 
I like the petunias. they they don't stand up to the

24:48.389 --> 25:15.527
heat quite as well the periwinkles or vinca are 
good a real good hot weather crop but a lot of people

24:48.389 --> 25:15.527
plant them too early and they start going down on 
them and what what they do they get a fungal

24:48.389 --> 25:15.527
infection on stems but you don't periwinkles 
shouldn't be planted until probably late may

24:48.389 --> 25:15.527
early june here because they're a lot like cotton. 
They like hot weather. But, no, there's a number of

25:20.272 --> 25:24.437
good plants.

25:26.159 --> 25:29.183
Could we ever have done any Texas wildflowers? 
Yeah, we tried to do some Texas wildflowers out on

25:30.384 --> 25:43.519
what we call the sea pasture out along Texas 
Avenue, and it didn't turn out very well. We had...

25:47.232 --> 25:50.299
I guess when Vandiver was president. There's out 
there, and I think Richard Thornton, who preceded

25:50.319 --> 26:05.612
me in the grounds area in the early 60s, Richard and 
I were classmates at Tech, but he had planted some

25:50.319 --> 26:05.612
islands of trees out there. Some of the crape 
myrtles came from the Riverside campus, the old

26:05.896 --> 26:12.164
annex, and they planted them out in that open area. 
And when we were trying to scrape up manpower to go

26:13.025 --> 26:26.361
west and handle horticulture and places like 
that, well, I talked to, I guess it might have been

26:13.025 --> 26:26.361
Chuck Cargill at the time. He might have been my 
boss in it, either he or Howard. And said, you know,

26:29.885 --> 26:34.030
I need to try to gain some mowing time at least. So we 
laid out some areas where those tree islands are

26:34.330 --> 26:39.716
that we didn't mow. We mowed them a couple of tree 
times a year. And that gave us enough manpower to go

26:42.379 --> 26:47.765
out and mow around horticulture and places like 
that. And in that, we tried to do some wildflowers.

26:50.929 --> 26:55.554
And at that point in time, we weren't that familiar 
with them. And we got a few going, but we didn't get

26:55.974 --> 27:02.802
enough soil contact and then when the the terminal 
uh, Eastwood terminal came in, we thought about

27:11.759 --> 27:18.129
doing some out there and I couldn't get 
permission. Nobody said, no, we don't want to do

27:18.630 --> 27:20.733
that. You know, and I kept saying, well, this might 
be appropriate, you know, and, and I wanted to do

27:20.993 --> 27:29.547
something again on the sea pasture because I think 
that would be very appropriate. And of course, Bob

27:29.627 --> 27:33.914
Ellis now has his driving range out there where I 
wanted to do a lot of that. But, um, they were afraid

27:34.014 --> 27:39.302
of the, um, see how the the rattiness that it might 
look you know what when it's going down I said

27:41.510 --> 28:10.690
people look at the roadsides they understand that 
you wait until they seed you mow them you know and

27:41.510 --> 28:10.690
you go on I said it would save us a lot of money but I 
never could and by then it was Robert Smith and that

27:41.510 --> 28:10.690
didn't fly right uh in terms of the let's go through 
the the vice presidents uh you first reported bob

28:11.311 --> 28:39.411
cherry tom cherry i mean tom cherry tom cherry uh 
clyde freeman hired vestal and vestal served till

28:11.311 --> 28:39.411
about when

28:11.311 --> 28:39.411
well let's see they vandiver split the job oh okay 
so this so and and then Cargill picked up the what

28:39.914 --> 29:03.610
they call it operations maybe or okay so you 
reported then to Chuck Cargill yeah did your title

28:39.914 --> 29:03.610
and responsibilities change no just what they did 
they took Chuck wound up with grounds physical

28:39.914 --> 29:03.610
plant

29:06.087 --> 29:13.256
University Police, the airport, and there was 
probably one other. No, that's about it. And then

29:15.178 --> 29:25.951
Howard kept the fiscal area, personnel, the 
auxiliaries, you know, that was kind of a split on

29:15.178 --> 29:25.951
it. What was Chuck Kergel's management style? 
Chuck was one of those that when he knew something,

29:30.404 --> 29:35.913
you knew it. And Joe Esterly, who was director of 
physical at the time, used to kid him for having

29:36.293 --> 29:44.226
Teflon overcoat because nothing stuck to that 
guy. You know, I like Chuck. Chuck's a good friend.

29:46.629 --> 29:53.560
But, I mean, any time he found out something, 
either Joe or I or Bob White, or all of us found out

29:54.282 --> 29:59.469
about it, depending on where the impetus went, you 
know, of the need. And he used to always say, he

30:00.530 --> 30:03.815
said, you guys do such a good job. I said, boy, 
you're just, you know, I don't know what I'd do

30:03.975 --> 30:08.441
without you. And, you know, we had a great 
relationship, really. I mean, because he went, I

30:12.146 --> 30:19.977
mean, the minute he found out something, you knew 
it. Who followed you? Robert Smith. his style was

30:24.995 --> 30:53.297
one of everything was close to the vest and Robert 
didn't tell you anything that he didn't think he

30:24.995 --> 30:53.297
didn't perceive you might need to know period 
that's just the way he was and going from Cargill to

30:24.995 --> 30:53.297
Robert Smith was really a shock yeah back in the 
late in the early 70s when I was first dean of

30:53.800 --> 31:19.555
faculty was the associate vice president of 
academic affairs and I remember one day we had a

30:53.800 --> 31:19.555
session at the working level with Robert Smith and 
Dick said when he dies they're gonna have to hire

30:53.800 --> 31:19.555
pallbearers so then so you reported to Robert 
throughout his Robert took over in 87, I think. And

31:28.114 --> 31:39.950
then, I guess in probably early, late 89, Robert 
replaced Joe Estrill. He and Joe got into

31:39.971 --> 31:42.194
something, I don't know. I'm not sure what it was. I 
know they had some, they would have some strong

31:45.779 --> 31:51.246
discussions on staff meeting, you know. But 
anyway, and then suddenly he moved Joe to

31:51.952 --> 32:00.904
associate director for utilities.

32:03.908 --> 32:11.458
And then early in 90, a guy by the name of Joe Sugg 
appeared. Sugg, S-U-G-G. Joe was an Air Force

32:12.660 --> 32:17.387
colonel, retired. And

32:22.816 --> 32:23.714
had
