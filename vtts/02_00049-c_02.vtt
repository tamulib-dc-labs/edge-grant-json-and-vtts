WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:04.362
Talking about staff assistants now. And this all 
dawned on me with Kent Caperton. And he

00:09.667 --> 00:16.134
represented the student body at a graduation 
ceremony and did such a super job. He was better

00:16.154 --> 00:19.137
than anybody on that stage that day. Because among 
those first were Caperton, Miller, and Dave

00:20.158 --> 00:25.163
Mayfield. Yeah. Among those first student 
assistants. And Kent was the first one. Well, I

00:32.060 --> 00:35.503
think that was a very good idea. And it helped us 
immeasurably in certain areas, Kent in

00:35.543 --> 00:48.034
particular, and then Roger Miller too, and others 
that followed. But as a result of that kind of

00:48.094 --> 01:02.067
togetherness, we formed, we, Harry Green, and 
Peggy Cooper, and me, and Kent, and Roger and

01:02.148 --> 01:14.059
sometimes John Sharp established the Fine Guys 
Association, which we referred to as the FGA. And

01:15.861 --> 01:21.626
our main mission was to get together at somebody's 
home for Monday night football. And we would down

01:23.188 --> 01:29.674
quite a few beers and refreshments, food and so 
forth. and become very close friends. And it was

01:34.107 --> 01:36.731
called the FGA. And Gint and Roger were charter 
members. And we teased John Sharp and played like

01:40.897 --> 01:47.106
he wasn't really a full-fledged member. And he 
really got upset with us because we'd let him come

01:48.809 --> 01:59.104
to the FGA meetings, but we weren't really sure 
enough to make him a charter member. But we had a lot

01:59.607 --> 02:01.849
of good times there. And in our own little world, a 
closeness that I've never seen duplicated. I

02:08.435 --> 02:10.737
don't think those kind of things are happening 
now. I fear they're not.

02:16.363 --> 02:24.350
How easy was it for you to be completely candid in 
answering a question to either of these two men? I

02:24.370 --> 02:27.673
had no qualms about that at all. reported on things 
that I had seen or heard that I would not say to you

02:28.328 --> 02:36.257
today right now because I thought it was that 
important. Some of them that were really... And

02:36.317 --> 02:48.851
you learned by experience that they were not going 
to hold it against you if you said what the truth

02:36.317 --> 02:48.851
was, even though you knew they weren't going to 
enjoy that truth. That's true. I had no qualms at

02:50.092 --> 02:56.479
all about saying, look, this is not good news that 
I'm about to tell you, but you really need to know

02:50.092 --> 02:56.479
this. And I told them collectively things that I 
wouldn't have told my mother. Who would Williams,

03:02.448 --> 03:13.681
on his administrative staff, whom do you think 
Williams trusted most or turned to most, relied

03:02.448 --> 03:13.681
upon most? Calhoun. Why were they so compatible?

03:20.309 --> 03:27.057
I think they had comparable racehorse minds down 
the same And

03:27.391 --> 03:36.305
I think totally trusted each other. I never did 
hear Dr. Williams express any kind of

03:36.326 --> 03:45.480
disappointment or criticism. That whole 
operation over there. And he...

03:54.020 --> 03:55.261
He wanted to change. He called me in one day. He 
says, Edwin, what would happen? And this is how he

04:00.266 --> 04:02.848
would pay attention to detail. What would happen

04:04.069 --> 04:16.120
if we stopped blowing that damn whistle at the 
laundry at 8, 12, and 5, or was it 8, 12, 1, and 5? It

04:16.281 --> 04:17.902
may have been four times a day. And I thought for a 
minute, and I said, Dr. Williams, there'll be some

04:19.323 --> 04:23.267
questions about it. but I don't think this 
university is going to collapse. He said, call

04:26.399 --> 04:30.925
them and tell them to stop blowing that damn thing 
today. And I don't remember who it was. I think it

04:34.290 --> 04:37.274
was Parsons, I guess. Or maybe it was Vestal, 
auxiliary services, the laundry. The whistle was

04:41.020 --> 04:42.622
at the laundry. And whoever it was says, my God, are 
you kidding? I said, I tell you what. I don't want to

04:50.416 --> 04:53.359
be around here if that thing blows again today. And 
so the whistle went out. But he was so funny about

04:57.503 --> 05:06.031
little details that somehow were offensive to him 
or unnecessary. And the worst excuse was, well,

05:07.332 --> 05:12.597
we've always done it this way. He did not buy that at 
all. Now, I came to the impression that one of the

05:14.719 --> 05:19.343
many talents Dr. Williams had was that at Clemson, 
a separate land grant school in the southern

05:19.981 --> 05:44.310
state, which was once all male, all white, 
compulsory military, not located on the main

05:19.981 --> 05:44.310
highway, about 100 miles from the capital city 
where the state university was located in that

05:19.981 --> 05:44.310
state, that Clemson had gone through many of the 
same changes, while he was a faculty member and

05:19.981 --> 05:44.310
administrator there, that A&M had gone through. 
So he could rely upon the experience there. He

05:48.474 --> 05:49.836
could understand some of that. Let's see, 
athletics. Share any athletic recollections for

05:54.403 --> 05:59.268
both presidents and their relations that you 
recall. Mr. Rudder was dead level serious about it

06:01.690 --> 06:06.055
and football in particular. I never heard him say 
anything about basketball, baseball, track. He

06:10.660 --> 06:15.185
just was a fiend about football and wanted to whip 
everybody's butts. Now that's all there are to it,

06:15.225 --> 06:18.709
including Admiral McCall's Bears. I remember 
that before the Cotton Bowl, when we were going to

06:20.123 --> 06:31.623
play Bear Bryant,

06:20.123 --> 06:31.623
I was 68. He

06:31.783 --> 06:44.545
did something I'd never dreamed I would ever see, 
and that is he, the president, in his big old gray

06:31.783 --> 06:44.545
suit went down there and gave a pep talk to Gene 
Stallings. He could not say Stallings. It was

06:48.534 --> 06:59.585
Stallings and his boys and gave them a pep talk with 
tears in his eyes about going out and beating hell

06:48.534 --> 06:59.585
out of Alabama, which they did. And I was at the game 
with him, the four of us, and he was so emotional

06:59.605 --> 07:10.836
about it that he said, come with me. And we went down 
and got on the cotton bowl field somehow and went

07:11.643 --> 07:22.176
down to the dressing room and he gave them another 
speech and they're standing stark naked. And I

07:22.196 --> 07:31.867
told the boy that was on that team out at Eldorado, a 
banker not five years ago, Bob Sykes says, have you

07:22.196 --> 07:31.867
ever heard of, I can't remember his name, I said, 
yeah. He was on the cotton bowl, the... He said,

07:34.846 --> 07:37.850
yeah, he sure was. He took me to the bank at El 
Dorado, and he introduced me, and I said, well,

07:37.870 --> 07:47.403
Charlie, I said, the last time I saw you, you were 
starting against these watchmen. And then I

07:49.587 --> 07:50.548
explained. But the Olympic Games came up, and 
Randy Mattson was going down, and Mr. Rutter came

07:51.089 --> 08:04.347
to me about six weeks before, maybe two months, and 
he says, Edwin, I'm going to buy your way to the

08:06.014 --> 08:08.176
Olympic Games, you and Peggy. And you're going 
with me and Henry Clay and Maggie McGee and Sally.

08:14.302 --> 08:25.333
And it's not going to cost you one penny, except 
that I want you to get the tickets to all of the

08:14.302 --> 08:25.333
events that we want to go to. And you make the 
arrangements for us to stay in a private home in

08:25.513 --> 08:34.722
Mexico City and get us a driver where all of us can 
get in one Cadillac and remember Mr. Clay's quite a

08:35.157 --> 08:36.718
large man. We need a big car. And he said, if you will 
make all the arrangements where all we have to do is

08:39.301 --> 08:44.686
go and pay for it, you got a trip. I said, you got it, 
David. And we got a house with maids and servants

08:47.088 --> 09:01.141
for the man that was in the executive for Kodak 
International, South America, Mexico, Central

08:47.088 --> 09:01.141
and South America. He was a judge in the sailing 
Olympics. turned his house over to us. And we had a

09:08.253 --> 09:13.379
chauffeur with an old Cadillac that hauled us all 
over Mexico City. We went to the track and field. We

09:16.543 --> 09:22.169
saw Randy throw the shot and get the gold medal. And 
it was another example of how Mr. Rutter would go to

09:22.189 --> 09:33.683
any ends to further the school in this way through 
recognition of athletics. But mainly his love was

09:34.034 --> 09:36.619
for football.

09:40.146 --> 09:49.445
I told you what he said to Shelby about his, he said, 
you're going to get the same contract I get,

09:40.146 --> 09:49.445
nothing. But Jack Williams.

10:00.629 --> 10:05.755
considered going to the games, I think, another 
necessary responsibility. I think it bored into

10:06.176 --> 10:07.657
tears. There was another tough, long work day. 
That's right. And if things didn't go right, it was

10:13.404 --> 10:20.573
another tough encounter with the regents who 
spent some time. Dooley Bell was just, I mean, I've

10:20.633 --> 10:25.759
seen him on, field trips with his Walkman radio on, 
listening to the TU game. Not A&M, but he wanted to

10:32.550 --> 10:37.756
know who was hopefully beating them at the moment. 
And he was quite serious about it. And I had one

10:41.642 --> 10:45.186
picture here I wanted to share with you. There's 
one of them.

10:55.726 --> 11:13.323
I

10:55.726 --> 11:13.323
can't help but figure that was the day he was 
inaugurated. I can't remember why we were all

11:14.344 --> 11:16.406
there. There's his wife. It must be the day that he 
was sworn in as a regent. I think so. Oh boy. I was so

11:24.921 --> 11:27.284
nervous as they were coming out. And I had a little 
land camera. And Mr. Rudder said, I'm going to

11:30.269 --> 11:32.912
shake his hand, get a picture of me. And I was so 
nervous I had to put the camera on the metal rail to

11:33.674 --> 11:39.282
take this picture. But that was a big event. But 
Williams realized that athletics and football in

11:41.905 --> 11:52.581
particular was a flagpole to rally the alumni 
around. and played like he enjoyed it, but he

11:53.253 --> 11:56.817
really didn't. Now, we didn't have under either of 
them, we didn't have any athletic scandals that I

11:56.837 --> 12:03.284
can recall. No alleged cheating. Not that I 
remember. We had some coaches that were

12:09.691 --> 12:15.017
terminated and some new coaches coming and going. 
Ballard came in. Right. Stallings out and Ballard

12:17.279 --> 12:21.965
in under Dr. Williams. Right. And as I have heard 
the

12:23.223 --> 12:38.018
unverified story that he turned Bud Wilkinson, 
the former great coach at OU, as a kind of advisor as

12:23.223 --> 12:38.018
to who to hire. That supposedly. If he did that, I 
don't remember it. Somebody told me that it was

12:43.103 --> 12:49.309
Wilkinson that suggested Ballard would be a real 
good choice. I remember coming into the. office

12:51.404 --> 13:21.360
one morning and that was one of the times he was 
there early and the Lord was there lighting his

12:51.404 --> 13:21.360
pipe and Dr. Williams evidently it all had been 
worked out and he said Edmund that's our new

12:51.404 --> 13:21.360
football coach you might want to go meet him but 
that was just something that had that he had to go

12:51.404 --> 13:21.360
through but Rutter was you know he was a coach too 
yes football coach and that's where he and Miss

12:51.404 --> 13:21.360
Rutter met He was the coach at Brady High School. 
She was a teacher. Oh, really? I didn't know that.

13:28.404 --> 13:30.847
She thought he was the handsomest thing she'd ever 
seen. And they fell in love and married. Now, she

13:33.530 --> 13:35.212
was from Brady? She was born in Sonora, Texas. Went 
to school close to her family's ranch, which is on

13:38.136 --> 13:47.989
an old road between downtown London and the town of 
Hext. Hext is on Highway 29 West and London is on the

13:51.406 --> 13:59.417
road that connects Mason with Junction. And she 
went to school usually horseback and the

14:01.560 --> 14:14.938
principal of the school's main thrill in life was 
catching she and whoever rode with her coming into

14:01.560 --> 14:14.938
town on their horses and driving by his car and 
slamming his hand on the side of the car to make the

14:15.357 --> 14:23.067
horses pitch them off. And then she went to UT and 
made lots of contacts there. Now, somebody told me

14:30.356 --> 14:37.124
one day that she and John and Nellie Connolly were 
undergraduate friends. I think that's right. Is

14:38.085 --> 14:38.546
that right? OK. And the Pickles somehow came in 
there, Jake Pickles. They were real close with

14:42.431 --> 14:44.093
Jake Pickles. That wouldn't hurt. Yeah. That 
wouldn't hurt. Then I heard also two or three

14:46.794 --> 14:52.159
people who told me about Mr. Rudder and a heifer at 
Tarleton that he staked on the football field.

15:02.370 --> 15:03.691
That is the story. And that's where I have it mixed 
up. It was at Tarleton, not at A&M. Somehow I had it

15:08.016 --> 15:11.839
in my mind that you're right, it was Tarleton. And 
somebody told me that they asked him, what

15:14.588 --> 15:20.635
happened if the heifer didn't produce as much milk 
as you needed to sell that day. And then he said,

15:20.655 --> 15:23.319
well, heck, you just add water on those days. Yeah, 
that's the story. I got it mixed up on where it was.

15:26.082 --> 15:36.535
And as I understand, the way it began is that he told 
the coach that he didn't have enough money and he

15:26.082 --> 15:36.535
was going to drop out and go home and go to work, 
depression time. And that the coach talked to

15:37.175 --> 15:43.363
somebody and they came up with the animal. And the 
coach said, okay, we can let it graze on the

15:44.002 --> 15:48.749
football field. All right, let's see. Were both of 
these families Methodist?

15:57.441 --> 15:58.883
The Williams and the Rudders? The Rudders for 
sure. And

16:00.005 --> 16:07.636
I believe the Williams were too, but somehow that 
doesn't... In no way do I infer that you needed to be

16:08.317 --> 16:12.102
a Methodist to be a key person at A&M, but they were 
both church-going families. They were both good

16:18.500 --> 16:21.325
parents.

16:25.011 --> 16:29.778
Let's see, Williams had, what, an adopted 
daughter. The one that was married in his house was

16:31.181 --> 16:35.187
an adopted child. And then a natural daughter. 
Yeah, yeah. And then the Rudders. They weren't

16:40.115 --> 16:42.599
there like the Rudder kids were. I knew every one of 
them. Now the Rudders were two boys and two girls?

16:48.449 --> 16:50.272
Two boys and three girls. Ann and Jane died, and 
then there's Bud and Bob. I had Ann in my first

16:57.504 --> 17:05.697
summer class in 1960.

17:06.098 --> 17:24.563
and she made a good solid grade with me because I had 
another faculty member's daughter in that same

17:06.098 --> 17:24.563
class and he was much discombobulated with me 
because his daughter had made a B and he told me she

17:06.098 --> 17:24.563
had never made a B at A&M Solid High School. I told 
him this was not A&M Solid High School. Then he

17:27.985 --> 17:32.191
blurted out the question, well, what grade did the 
old rudder girl make? And I told him she made the

17:32.752 --> 17:35.556
same grade that his daughter made. And he then 
cleared his face and said, well, OK, that's all

17:36.357 --> 17:41.805
right then. Somebody apparently had told him that 
I had given Ann Rudder an A and his daughter a B. And

17:47.193 --> 17:49.517
that had him very bothered. Let's see, any other 
anecdotes, legends, myths about either of those

17:49.637 --> 17:55.866
men in those days?

17:59.542 --> 18:06.610
A funny thing happened one night at one of these 
alumni gatherings, the board meetings. Mr.

18:07.891 --> 18:09.653
Rutter went to them. Faithfully, Dr. Williams 
would look for any kind of excuse and would send me.

18:15.680 --> 18:20.665
But one night, one weekend rather, we met at 
Bandera, Texas. And J. Harold Dunn, who was on that

18:22.127 --> 18:27.793
board, not the NM board, took it upon himself to 
make all of the arrangements for our

18:30.237 --> 18:37.184
entertainment at the big dance hall up there that 
Saturday night. Dick Winters did a barbecue for

18:37.905 --> 18:39.787
us. And then we all retreated to downtown Bandera, 
had reserved seats. And he had some of them's wives

18:45.773 --> 18:53.040
were there for some reason. But for those whose 
wives were not there, legitimate escort so

18:56.410 --> 19:00.837
everyone would have someone to dance with. And the 
one I had was one of the Frost National Bank ladies

19:00.857 --> 19:12.194
whose husband had been killed in one of the wars. 
But Harold Dunn made all of those arrangements and

19:13.175 --> 19:20.987
made sure that we had a good band there that night. 
And I was seated next to Mr. Rudder and All of the

19:25.385 --> 19:33.233
sound suddenly stopped, and there were lights 
over the doorway so that as people entered, you

19:25.385 --> 19:33.233
could see them. And a small group of five or six 
people came in, and there was the most beautiful

19:33.253 --> 19:47.807
human being I've ever seen in my life in a white 
silvery gown with sequins all over it,

19:33.253 --> 19:47.807
blonde-headed girl. And I said to Mr. Rudder, you 
see that girl there? He says, whoo! I said, I'll bet

19:56.097 --> 20:03.590
you before this night's over, I'll bet you $5 that 
she'll let me dance with her. And he said, well,

20:03.871 --> 20:05.494
she's with somebody. I said, I'll bet you $5 I'll 
dance with her. He said, you're on. And before they

20:11.945 --> 20:20.721
were seated, the music started, and I went up to 
that girl, said hello to her escort or whatever,

20:11.945 --> 20:20.721
and I said, You are about the prettiest thing I've 
ever seen. Would you dance with me right now before

20:23.468 --> 20:26.211
you all settle in? She said, sure. And so I steered 
her over to this long table. There was Darcy

20:30.196 --> 20:37.885
McQuarrie and Earl Rudder and Harold Dunn and 
Maggie McGee, all those old boys. And I could see

20:39.367 --> 20:40.648
Mr. Rudder looking up at me as we were coming to him. 
And as we walked by, he had his $5 out. And I picked it

20:49.078 --> 20:50.860
up as I went by. I

20:51.700 --> 20:57.766
told you the airplane story. One time, Mr. Rudder 
said, let's go dove hunting. This was in, like,

21:05.614 --> 21:07.596
October.

21:10.299 --> 21:11.300
I said, when do you want to go? We'd gone over to the 
Herman Heath place in Austin, Buda, and other

21:11.360 --> 21:16.586
places. And he said, I want to go to the ranch, his 
ranch. It was really miserable. It still is. I

21:25.455 --> 21:26.777
said, when do you want to go? And he said, Friday 
afternoon. I said, well, how are you going to get to

21:31.204 --> 21:33.327
Lubbock to the game? He says, I'm not going. He 
said, I am just sick and tired of

21:36.291 --> 21:46.266
everything that's going on at these ballgames as 
much as I love them. I need a break. And I'm not going

21:48.369 --> 21:50.091
to the Lubbock game. But I have to be out of town. I 
said, sure, we'll go. So we went and landed at

21:56.296 --> 22:02.623
Menard. There's a little airstrip at Menard right 
by the Coatman Co-op. And we landed there and went

22:08.429 --> 22:12.734
hunting. And that night, he said, let's go down to 
London. and eat a chicken fried steak at the cafe. I

22:21.081 --> 22:21.883
said, let's do. And the dance hall was right next 
door. And they are still on Saturday nights

22:25.668 --> 22:28.132
dancing there. And we were seated there. And there 
was a one-inch wall made out of 1 by 12s between the

22:33.400 --> 22:40.150
dance hall and the cafe where we were seated. I 
said, I think I heard the music start in there. I

22:42.833 --> 22:44.135
think the dance has started. And he put his hand up 
on the wall. He said, no. It's not throbbing

22:48.425 --> 22:49.587
enough. The dance hadn't started. I'll tell you 
when the dance starts. But we just got there to

22:54.257 --> 22:56.542
escape. And Mr. Rutter was much better, more 
skilled at breaking away from it all when he'd

22:57.804 --> 23:08.526
reached the saturation point. than Dr. Williams 
was. He could unwind pretty well for a while and

23:11.607 --> 23:16.531
then go back. But Dr. Williams couldn't. And 
again, I think both of their intensity with their

23:19.254 --> 23:28.582
job and lack of Williams would play like he was 
playing golf. But his mind was still on him. And I

23:31.584 --> 23:34.026
think that killed both of them. Let's make believe 
that you are in a position to give advice to the A&M

23:38.999 --> 23:43.783
board and campus leadership today? What would it 
be for now and the future? The A&M board and what?

23:49.448 --> 24:00.658
And the campus leadership as well, the president, 
the provost, et cetera.

24:00.678 --> 24:08.905
I think one thing I would advise, if I was in that 
high and mighty position, is to look at ways that we

24:00.678 --> 24:08.905
might

24:12.192 --> 24:16.799
over a planned and graceful period of time reduce 
the enrollment. I think it's way too high.

24:25.233 --> 24:34.588
And in doing that in an organized way, get back to 
what both Williams and Rutter hoped for, and that

24:25.233 --> 24:34.588
is personalize the classroom situation, get it 
down to reasonable numbers where they do know

24:35.598 --> 24:46.536
Professor Monroe and a little bit about him and 
vice versa. And that the class sizes be reduced in

24:47.918 --> 24:54.809
particular areas to where it should be. 
Student-teacher ratio is something that really

24:54.869 --> 24:58.014
bothers me. And yet, in 1950, when I took chemistry 
a sophomore level chemistry there were 333

25:02.699 --> 25:27.762
students in that class but i think we're losing a 
lot of the closeness between students and faculty

25:02.699 --> 25:27.762
that we had at one time and uh i think as you had 
pointed out earlier with one example that we're

25:02.699 --> 25:27.762
with that we've broken down a great deal on our 
interest in counseling with students about

25:02.699 --> 25:27.762
courses to take How do you compensate for a guy 
that's weak? And I don't think we know them that

25:31.010 --> 25:37.319
well, like the poor boy that jumped off the 
building the other day. I'm not sure anybody could

25:37.439 --> 25:39.542
have saved him. But those kind of things are 
rearing up more and more. And I think it all goes

25:42.887 --> 25:45.891
back to what Dr. Williams said. You get above 
35,000, and the place begins to break up. And I

25:50.817 --> 25:53.101
think we've seen a lot of that. The political part, 
namely the Jesus himself, I don't know, might have

25:58.083 --> 26:11.503
to intervene, but to get the selection of board 
members back to something that's other than

25:58.083 --> 26:11.503
political and get people on these boards that 
understand higher education, that's critical.

26:12.104 --> 26:21.178
And if the board and the administrators can't get 
along and can't agree because of politics, I think

26:12.104 --> 26:21.178
that's a sad state of affairs. That one I don't know 
how you'll ever solve unless you have the right

26:22.019 --> 26:26.065
kind of governor in there. Do today's former 
student association leadership

26:26.753 --> 26:41.668
and today's regents, are they people of lesser 
stature than 20, 30 years ago? They seem to be.

26:45.112 --> 26:48.495
Maybe with the former students, we're dealing 
with so much volume. But you don't see, I don't see,

26:54.715 --> 26:57.858
I see a lot of people in the key positions that I've 
never heard of before. Like when I was talking to

26:58.499 --> 27:00.341
Dick Hervey. He was rattling off who the key 
leaders were when he was the executive director.

27:08.169 --> 27:13.835
And it was Jay Harold Dunn and Conley from... Dick 
Conley. Dick Conley. Dick Winters. And he just

27:18.239 --> 27:20.201
started rattling off... John Younger. Yeah, and 
they were all corporate presidents. people that

27:24.331 --> 27:28.175
could have called the governor's office and 
gotten through quickly. Today's leaders are

27:28.776 --> 27:41.971
good, decent people, but they are just middle 
class folks like the rest of us that don't have

27:28.776 --> 27:41.971
quite as much muscle as they might have had. Those 
leaders, those caliber of people are bound to be

27:43.232 --> 27:47.357
out there. But to me, they're just not coming 
forward to serve like they did at that time. back in

27:53.862 --> 27:54.904
those days. And the same thing with the region. 
Somehow, regardless of what the system is, we're

28:02.234 --> 28:11.388
not getting the kind of people that come to campus 
and say, Mr. President, what do you want us to do to

28:02.234 --> 28:11.388
support you? It's what I want you to do for me. It may 
be contrary in all ways to the good of the

28:14.252 --> 28:18.418
university. Let's see. Did I ask you for favorite 
Williams anecdote? Yeah. Humor? Yeah, we got some

28:24.559 --> 28:26.502
of those. Okay. I'm inclined to say let's quit for 
today. And then we get into student. Okay. On

28:34.394 --> 28:36.437
another day, we'll do your student days. That'd be 
fine. Because it's 315, 320 now. I'll start by

28:39.963 --> 28:43.208
saying that...

28:44.774 --> 28:48.477
when I really hadn't thought seriously yet about 
coming to A&M. My dad was such a rabid Aggie fan,

28:48.517 --> 28:53.722
having never been to college of any sort, though. 
But he was so impressed by the men in San Marcos that

28:53.842 --> 29:04.992
had gone to A&M that he decided in his mind that that 
must be the best school in the world and wanted very

28:53.842 --> 29:04.992
much for me to go. And the way he got me to go, and 
we'll start this next time, I went to him one day. I

29:11.177 --> 29:12.939
said, Daddy, my trombone's worn out. I can nearly 
see through the slide. I'm playing football and I

29:15.723 --> 29:18.848
don't get to play at halftime anyway. I think I'll 
just quit the band. Boy, that was a knife in the

29:22.593 --> 29:26.599
heart for a professional musician. He says, no, 
no, you're not going to quit the band. Here's what

29:32.868 --> 29:35.953
I'll do, he said, about that old worn-out horn. He 
said, if that's an embarrassment to you, I'm going

29:38.036 --> 29:41.781
to the San Antonio Music Company and buy you a super 
old gold-colored trombone, the finest made. And

29:49.287 --> 29:58.395
he said, that'll probably cost me $3 or $4 a week, 
but I'll pay for it that way if you promise me that

29:49.287 --> 29:58.395
you will play that trombone in the Aggie band. I 
said, OK. And I didn't give it any more thought than

30:00.677 --> 30:05.682
that, and I did. And after I was married halfway 
through school, the band was tough those first two

30:05.702 --> 30:11.987
years. I can tell you, well, I will, horror 
stories. But when I got married, living in

30:15.823 --> 30:30.743
Collegeview, I thought, now here's my chance to 
gracefully get out of this thing and have more free

30:15.823 --> 30:30.743
time and not all the misery that goes with the 
promptness required of somebody in the band. And

30:30.763 --> 30:33.706
I've been in a hard field of study, and I need to 
study more. So easy. And then I thought, now wait

30:35.208 --> 30:38.553
just a minute. I think he meant four years, not two. 
And I'm not going to forget. And I've always been

30:44.382 --> 30:49.306
proud that I did not when it would have been so easy. 
I would say I didn't have a car and a bicycle. And you

30:51.968 --> 30:54.311
still think he did mean to for four years? I think 
so. I know the spirit was there in that. Had you

30:59.315 --> 31:00.976
visited the campus? Only for a football game or 
two. Not many of those. We couldn't afford to. I saw

31:06.681 --> 31:10.645
as many Aggie games in Austin as I did here because 
it's just 28 miles. Now you came in 49? 49. So you

31:13.036 --> 31:21.091
were a freshman in college a year after me, so I can 
identify with those words. And I was in the last

31:21.392 --> 31:25.640
freshman class to attend the Riverside campus. 
The Riverside campus.
