WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:06.581
How did y'all think before, how did y'all feel 
about what was going to be won? What did y'all think

00:06.642 --> 00:08.105
they would take? Well, as far as some military, you 
know, front of you, see,

00:19.252 --> 00:28.365
There's one time, you know, President Nixon 
ordered the bombardment of North Vietnam by B-52.

00:28.385 --> 00:36.457
And this affects a lot of the moral of the North, you 
know, the truth of what it was. But, you see, from my

00:36.477 --> 00:48.735
point of view, I think, you know, if President 
Nixon, you know, is not so busy about the election,

00:36.477 --> 00:48.735
it's because He tried to pull out. He tried to say, 
well, I can, I make peace, you know, and I can pull

00:51.951 --> 00:58.059
the G.I. back from Vietnam. Right. Because he was 
more concerned about the re-election.

01:05.609 --> 01:07.131
Re-election, exactly. And the war itself with 
Vietnam. Well, he didn't want to get out of history

01:09.815 --> 01:12.338
without having lost the war. Yeah. See? But if we 
just keep going, you know, keep pin down, you know,

01:13.640 --> 01:27.860
with the B-52, you know, in another, you know, 
maybe a week, another two weeks, you know, and then

01:13.640 --> 01:27.860
they can bring them up, you know, to the table.

01:29.722 --> 01:30.443
It's too useless. Even this guy will work, you 
know, okay, you fire, you know, maybe three days,

01:30.464 --> 01:35.531
and then you start to pull back. Yeah. It does

01:37.493 --> 01:42.080
not make sense. See, Look, a man with a two-minute 
fortune or five hours, you see, you can knock up

01:46.951 --> 01:49.554
everything. Now, Americans are not authorized, 
you know, to bombard, you know, the dam, you know,

01:49.574 --> 01:59.266
or the river, you know, because over there, the 
river, you know, is not enough. If there are other

01:59.286 --> 02:04.733
big cities or anything, you know, the water's 
going to flood, you know, yeah. No. Americans are

02:05.034 --> 02:09.720
supposed to, you know, to bombard, you know, those 
dams. Because, well, due to the fact also, you

02:09.740 --> 02:16.468
know, the first, see, The old report goes there. 
Sometimes, you know, they're reporting the good

02:21.678 --> 02:26.825
side of the war. See? And they're reporting the bad 
side of the war. They report, you know, once in, you

02:30.209 --> 02:43.505
know, in the operation, you know, they report, you 
know, once in, you know, they talk, you know, one of

02:30.209 --> 02:43.505
the Germans, you know, talked to, you know, one of 
the prisoners or something like that, you know.

02:43.525 --> 02:47.991
And they take those pictures, you know, and then 
they report those, you know. And due to the fact,

02:50.080 --> 02:56.909
all over the media, you know, Blake, reports, you 
know, those seats in the back homes. A lot of people

02:58.612 --> 03:02.457
see this, you know, say, well, if D.I. goes over 
there and do those seats, you know, and talk to

03:02.477 --> 03:10.488
people and shoot

03:02.477 --> 03:10.488
them. You're saying that I... You're saying like 
another week or so they would have been able to

03:16.557 --> 03:22.046
bring the Northern Vietnamese to the conference 
table, right? I have a conviction like this, you

03:22.126 --> 03:25.932
know, because they served for it also. They served 
for it, you know, when the B-52 bombed out of the war

03:25.952 --> 03:30.459
zone. Yeah. So there would have been an 
opportunity for a compromise settlement, right?

03:34.946 --> 03:35.868
Yeah. Like they had an opportunity for that a lot of 
times. I had a question. Would the South

03:42.882 --> 03:46.787
Vietnamese people have wanted to compromise 
settlement to the water? Do you think that? How do

03:49.792 --> 03:52.235
you feel about that? I don't think, you know, it's 
time to compromise, you know, with the

03:52.355 --> 03:59.886
government, you know. Okay, the thing is, the 
North's communists never recognized, you know,

04:00.366 --> 04:09.880
the government of the South. Or vice versa, right? 
Okay, the Tsar women never recognized the

04:11.468 --> 04:15.217
government, okay? Because the communists said 
their old government is the government of the

04:16.561 --> 04:22.997
whole Vietnam. But the government of the South, 
they said, you know, set up, you know, by

04:24.850 --> 04:30.737
emergency. Yeah. That's not real, you know, to 
work with them. To work with one of the people?

04:35.443 --> 04:35.863
Yeah. That's the way they said. That's what North 
Korea said. Yeah. So why, you know, the government

04:38.526 --> 04:43.112
on the South, you know, try to have a compromise? 
Well, see, because either you exist with them, you

04:45.435 --> 04:51.482
see, under them, or not opposed. So to exist with 
them is under them. You can. You can exist with

04:58.651 --> 05:00.994
them, because they won't last. Yeah. So what do you 
think would have been the possible results of a

05:01.996 --> 05:06.943
compromised settlement? Communist domination? 
Yeah, communist domination. Well, they're the

05:09.307 --> 05:10.629
way they are. There's no compromise with them. 
Because they want to take over the South. That's

05:18.220 --> 05:20.203
what they want. So they don't recognize any 
another government. This government is not, you

05:23.913 --> 05:27.720
know, of their own. So, when you're saying that 
another week longer they would have been able to

05:29.123 --> 05:33.773
bring them to a table? Yeah, to have, you know, 
shields on top of them, you know, to... In order to

05:38.442 --> 05:45.011
recognize the divided Vietnam, North and South? 
At least, you know, they would say, well, we

05:45.131 --> 05:55.485
negotiate, you know, and then we pull all those 
troops out, and then the South Vietnamese can

05:45.131 --> 05:55.485
leave alone. Okay, so they would go separately. 
Yeah. I see.

06:06.168 --> 06:09.934
What do you think about U.S. military tactics? 
What do you think of U.S. military tactics, like

06:09.954 --> 06:19.670
bombing the North, or the use of Agent Orange, the 
defoliation of the countryside of crops? What do

06:20.912 --> 06:23.396
you think of those tactics? American tactics used 
to be used like this. I wouldn't use to fight a

06:31.598 --> 06:43.170
conventional war, you know, with aviation, with 
everything, you know, to neutralize the enemy.

06:44.431 --> 06:57.184
But the kind of war for, you know, at least, you 
know, for the beginning of the war in the South of

06:44.431 --> 06:57.184
Vietnam, that's a very hard to fight kind of war. 
The wall of war. Yeah, ghetto war. Now,

07:00.792 --> 07:17.029
in some, what we call a displacement of war, 
because the economy is more mobile, You see, they

07:17.903 --> 07:23.288
use, sometimes they use kabocha, you know, if they 
have a tooth. They use what? If they have a tooth,

07:24.409 --> 07:32.416
see, or their, what do you call, backbone, you 
know, to support their war effort. Kabocha? Yeah.

07:33.978 --> 07:38.682
You see, by storage of ammunition and everything 
there, you know. Yeah. Okay. And they, they're

07:39.583 --> 07:41.385
more mobile. These times, and they never, they 
never, you know, You might be trying, you know,

07:47.114 --> 07:52.260
maybe camp in a jungle, but maybe underground. In 
the deep underground, you know, there are command

07:52.841 --> 08:00.110
posts, everything underground. It's hard to 
detect. See? But they're not built, you know, some

08:02.873 --> 08:09.441
kind of like camp, you know, on the surface, you 
know, like we used to do. See? That's why, you know,

08:09.582 --> 08:16.530
it's easier to make those camps, you know, a 
target, you know, for artillery. So you don't

08:17.303 --> 08:20.335
agree with the fact that these are in defoliation? 
Well, defoliation, you know, the purpose of

08:21.238 --> 08:26.318
defoliation is To deter, you know, well, because 
the communists use those junkers, you know, to

08:27.260 --> 08:40.033
hit, you know, their storage, the munitions, 
everything. Now, the junkers over there, you

08:40.053 --> 08:45.419
know, there's no way, you know, you can see. If you 
fly right on top of that, there's no way you can see.

08:50.084 --> 08:51.225
See, I'm so sick. See, and there you go, gentlemen, 
you know, at their point, you know, everything

08:52.859 --> 09:01.153
they wanted to ask, see? They came, whatever, the 
gentlemen. So you think it was necessary? I think,

09:06.842 --> 09:17.280
you know, in the war, you know, every minute, you 
know, you have to do everything, I believe, for

09:06.842 --> 09:17.280
you, you know, to deter another enemy. See, if I'm a 
commander, I tell you what, you know, I agree, you

09:18.138 --> 09:36.368
know, with Senator Goldwater, you know, about 
saying, you know, I have to make firm, you know,

09:18.138 --> 09:36.368
just bombard, you know, the whole border, 
Cambodia, there will be no clean, nothing at all.

09:36.448 --> 09:41.797
And you can see the communists, you know, they'll 
give it all a high. That's all.

09:45.188 --> 09:58.472
Well the information has an effect also, because 
they kill all three and then all the phone and all

09:45.188 --> 09:58.472
this, but you don't have choice, either you fight a 
war or you don't. But if you fight a war, and

10:00.276 --> 10:07.028
everything, because if your enemy thinks once and 
for all that Why do you send a tank for? Because the

10:10.021 --> 10:13.065
enemy may have your artillery, right? You send an 
airplane because the enemy may have your

10:13.085 --> 10:19.294
artillery. So they use the junkers, you know, as 
their benefit. Why not detail those

10:24.121 --> 10:30.450
parts?

10:33.383 --> 10:40.670
I consider, you know, those generals just an 
obstacle, you know, for the operation. Because if

10:40.690 --> 10:47.017
you see an airplane and you see a regular airplane, 
you couldn't see them. But they can see you. See, so

10:50.180 --> 10:52.062
they're advantageous. Yeah, they can see you. 
Yeah, they're the advantage for it. Yeah, because

10:54.064 --> 10:57.207
you move in the open. And they just, you know, 
hidden behind trees. Yeah. And you've been in

11:00.738 --> 11:05.143
this, there's a plan for you. Well, how about, I 
also, we learned that the Decolation of Wausau

11:05.163 --> 11:12.751
used to cut off, I guess, the crops. Supposedly, so 
that the communists wouldn't use to take the crops

11:13.492 --> 11:19.038
from the end. Well, you see, this old part of Peru 
also, because we know in some part of the country,

11:19.058 --> 11:30.610
okay, the government couldn't control over the 
crowd. But the people over there, because they're

11:34.873 --> 11:45.543
so afraid to be killed, because the communists 
said, OK, if you have Christians, you grow wheat.

11:47.285 --> 11:54.692
You have to contribute to the communist party. So 
if you let those people, you want to stop You see,

11:58.636 --> 12:01.963
you start to know their infiltration rules. So 
they try to cut their food and cut their supplies.

12:05.831 --> 12:12.545
But the local people, you know, or the local people 
in the farmland just keep supplies there, you

12:05.831 --> 12:12.545
know, with drugs. Out of fear? Yeah. Do you think 
anybody's starved because of that? Well, nobody

12:19.460 --> 12:23.203
started that, but, you know, they're oppressed, 
you know. Then they come to kill you. If you don't

12:25.425 --> 12:30.830
give your part of your crossness to them, they 
might be killed. Yeah, but I mean, if they

12:30.850 --> 12:35.855
defoliated the cops, do you think everybody would 
have a lot of people? No, I don't see, you know,

12:35.875 --> 12:38.557
those people. You don't see those,

12:38.817 --> 12:42.461
no. But did they keep the communists from getting 
the food? Yeah, that's, well, you see, that's one

12:45.624 --> 12:49.467
of the tactics, you know, we use in the war. 
Because, like I said, the communists like, you

12:50.965 --> 13:00.757
know, Mao Zedong they said, the communists, you 
know, fight war. It's like a fish in a bowl. See,

13:04.881 --> 13:08.346
they said a population is a water. Is a water? Yeah. 
The communists is a fish. Now, the fish cannot

13:13.472 --> 13:16.315
survive, you know, without water. So the 
communist doctrine, they say, well, you fight the

13:18.202 --> 13:25.519
war with the population support. You use the 
population support. of the resource, you know,

13:30.250 --> 13:34.917
that the population can give you. So when, you 
know, the government goes to find, you have to

13:34.937 --> 13:43.710
supply them, you know, with everything they have 
to carry, you know, the food with them, right? But

13:43.770 --> 13:47.936
the government is wrong, because they know they go 
everywhere. If they dig there, they stop there,

13:47.956 --> 13:55.768
they can, people in there, out of the field, you 
know, can give them to eat. But the communists, you

13:56.997 --> 14:02.082
know, they don't eat too much. It's, you know, just 
maybe they eat only rice and things like that.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.493
Well, of course, you know, some part of the country 
went frozen. See, you had the jungle right here,

14:14.014 --> 14:18.018
okay? And then you had, you know, rice fields over 
here. Now, you spray, you know, you spray for the

14:23.403 --> 14:25.705
jungle. But how can, you know, you stop, you know, 
this, this chemical blow, you know, to the right

14:26.748 --> 14:32.555
here? It won't blow. Well, I don't have an 
accident. Yeah. Well, because we never saw in the

14:37.340 --> 14:49.714
control area, control under the government, we 
don't have any defoliation in those areas. The one

14:49.734 --> 14:53.759
is over control area. Yeah. Those are some of the 
pre-fire zones? Well, you can call something like

14:57.224 --> 15:00.209
that, you know. It's beyond, you know, the 
government's control. Well, the government

15:02.532 --> 15:08.782
said, okay, now, people living in this area get to 
do, you know, that's it. Oh, what for? Strategic

15:09.363 --> 15:10.225
handouts? Yes. Oh, well, not strategic handouts, 
you know. The strategic handouts is different.

15:15.473 --> 15:17.616
What was that for? Well, you see, we call, you know, 
just uncontrolled jobs. mostly, you know, a

15:22.790 --> 15:34.303
general and some leaders, you know, that have 
abandoned the rice fields before, you know,

15:22.790 --> 15:34.303
because people are not living anymore there. I 
mean, leaving some parts, you know, and then the

15:34.323 --> 15:42.232
communists, you know, tried to give those parts, 
you know, to their own. But we, I never see, you

15:42.252 --> 15:51.362
know, the airplane, you know, sprayed in the You 
see, because, okay, over there,

15:51.595 --> 16:12.851
you had,

15:51.595 --> 16:12.851
you know, people living in the city, and around the 
city, and we call, you know, the secure area. Now,

16:14.434 --> 16:16.337
the area the government can organize, you know, 
security, like militia, you know, or things like

16:16.992 --> 16:25.406
this. Then we can call it, you know, security. And 
then people can work, you know. And then we didn't

16:29.252 --> 16:34.861
have any problems with those people. Sometimes, 
you know, the government helped to provide them,

16:34.881 --> 16:40.570
you know, the attractive. to work on the fields or 
provide them with fertilizer so they can increase

16:41.596 --> 16:52.352
the ground. But they spray the government and with 
another, you know, it's sprayed only in the

16:52.372 --> 17:00.704
uncontrolled areas. Those areas are supposed to 
be, you know, under the communists. So the South

17:06.689 --> 17:13.723
Vietnamese government did it also, right? Or was 
it just the Americans that did that? In the

17:18.212 --> 17:28.191
beginning, you know, the Vietnamese

17:18.212 --> 17:28.191
did some, but not very much. And before, you know, 
the village provided protection, you know, with a

17:28.762 --> 17:48.778
type of, you know, protection, but later on, you 
know, I'm not going to do that. Well, you see, I can

17:49.838 --> 17:59.427
see, you know, most of depoliation, you know, is 
used along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, mostly. Just

17:59.447 --> 17:59.727
mainly. Of course, you know, because Ho Chi Minh 
Trail, you know, it's not like, you know, Highway

18:01.208 --> 18:09.295
3610, and then you can see, you know, straight line 
like this. Right. See, because it's hard, you

18:10.676 --> 18:15.961
know, the trail in the jungle, you know, and then 
how do you go to spray? Because you have to spray

18:15.981 --> 18:18.023
while you say, okay, now. Yeah, you just spray, you 
know, maybe 25, you know, miles a week, you know, a

18:18.256 --> 18:30.987
day, you know. Yeah. Yeah, because there's no, a 
straight line, you know, in there. Yeah. You never

18:35.553 --> 18:39.137
know, you know, what it's going to be. Yeah. Well, 
there's depredation. Well, what do you think

18:41.821 --> 18:47.447
about the use of other chemicals? Like napalm and 
other stuff. Do you think those are necessary?

18:51.232 --> 18:53.294
Well, napalm, you know, is far over the top. 
Because when you have an enemy, you know, big arm,

18:53.314 --> 19:01.765
there's no way you can...

19:01.785 --> 19:03.687
I, for myself, you know, I... If you hit a justified 
target, then you can use all means to knock the

19:05.287 --> 19:16.936
enemy

19:05.287 --> 19:16.936
out. And what is justified? Is that like what it was 
in Mount Seville? If the neighbor, you know,

19:23.630 --> 19:33.346
trapped in a village sometime, because maybe only 
one communist in there, only one sniper. I think

19:33.426 --> 19:35.850
this is not necessary. You're not justified. But, 
I tell you, like I said, the communists, they never

19:38.935 --> 19:49.452
use an open, you know, fight. You see, they use the 
village, you know, as their hidden position or

19:51.322 --> 19:58.269
something, you know. Right, so they can blend in? 
Yeah, they can blend, see, they can, well, if they,

19:59.450 --> 20:06.738
they were, we're siblings, and then they just 
throw the gun, and then they become siblings. They

20:06.758 --> 20:10.922
use siblings, you know, so. But sometimes like 
this, you know, it's hard. I think that's a

20:14.065 --> 20:19.911
military point of view, you know, because... I 
know, I know, you know, I didn't fight the

20:21.967 --> 20:39.432
airplane, I didn't fight, you know, fight the 
airplane, but one of the pilots, you know, one of my

20:21.967 --> 20:39.432
students before, and they said, well, sometimes 
they don't have choice. You see, because, okay,

20:40.975 --> 20:51.450
most of the time, you know, if you come attacked, 
you know, they, okay, you see, there's a village

20:40.975 --> 20:51.450
down here. And they come in the birds.

20:58.319 --> 21:00.841
They don't care about the people living there. 
They're there, and then they get around the

21:00.922 --> 21:07.268
funeral of the birds. And then from there, they're

21:08.789 --> 21:14.395
shooting out. And then part of the problem is, OK, 
now, we know that the communists are there, and

21:14.595 --> 21:22.163
there's no way we can be The soldiers, you know, 
cannot advance in there because they're firing at

21:22.362 --> 21:26.426
too high. So they pop the bomb. The robots never 
open. Of course, you might be killed, you know,

21:32.212 --> 21:40.741
maybe three guys, three communists, but you might 
be killed with the same amount of civilians.

21:40.761 --> 21:41.842
Right. But because the communists, you know, they 
just, you know... They don't give you any

21:45.226 --> 21:46.567
alternative. Yeah, they don't give you any 
alternative because they're just killing them. I

21:50.531 --> 21:51.492
would think of it like that. Because, well, you 
see, that's a part, you know, to fully criticize,

21:53.328 --> 22:03.260
you know, the military conduct of the operation. 
But if you're the commander of the operation, that

22:03.801 --> 22:10.309
you don't have, you have dilemma. Okay, now, if I 
can, I have the mission to deploy this target, but I

22:22.083 --> 22:27.669
couldn't sense, you know, our troops in there, 
because the heavy fire they had on us. Now, if I used

22:28.390 --> 22:40.042
bombs, I could knock them out, because the bombs, 
you know, maybe dropped in here, you know, or maybe

22:28.390 --> 22:40.042
they just had to change their mix there. They were 
killed. And then the next one I have to use, you

22:43.065 --> 22:51.094
know, to snuggle, you know, to murder them.

22:53.386 --> 23:04.378
So that's why, you know, it's very difficult to 
find a guerrilla war.

23:08.142 --> 23:11.045
It's not a conventional war. You can see the enemy, 
see the trust, you know, the beautiful ones. You

23:18.013 --> 23:18.854
can see them. But the guerrillas, that's very 
difficult. The communists, they trained very

23:23.744 --> 23:43.716
well, because they said, well, they can use a small 
number to make a big section. But they said, well,

23:43.736 --> 23:50.848
now they have to hide somewhere. in order to do 
their mission, you know, because they have to get

23:51.689 --> 24:02.283
used, you know, as a village, you know, as their 
turn of retreat or whatever, you know, because

23:51.689 --> 24:02.283
they say, well, they're Syrians. You see, it, it 
was the most, you know, when you, when you overrun

24:04.646 --> 24:14.659
this village that you can see all the Syrians, you 
didn't know who, who's fighting and who the, the

24:04.646 --> 24:14.659
infant people. Because they try to take this 
advantage from the Americans. Because they don't

24:20.288 --> 24:26.899
care, they don't care, you know, if the Americans, 
you know, kill innocent people. Because if the

24:28.562 --> 24:32.689
Americans kill innocent people, that's good for 
them to propaganda. Right. See? So they don't

24:36.295 --> 24:43.026
care, you know, about, you know, if you talk now on 
the board, you know, for us today. because we

24:43.934 --> 24:46.496
killed innocent people. But for them, it's a 
victory for them. They say, well, they send the

24:49.339 --> 24:58.788
airplane, they send the bomb, they maybe just kill 
only one communist, but how much, you know, do

24:49.339 --> 24:58.788
people kill? But you don't have choice. Look at 
this kind of world, you know, you don't have

25:01.091 --> 25:03.553
choice. Okay.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.823
There's some questions like, I don't know, they 
don't really fit in there, but... I just have two

25:15.507 --> 25:17.209
questions. You said something about propaganda. 
Was there any U.S. propaganda during the war? Or

25:22.737 --> 25:26.943
was there freedom of press in South Carolina? 
Well, in South Carolina, we have freedom of press.

25:30.328 --> 25:31.569
Well, absolutely. Absolutely, really, you know, 
freedom like you. Because, okay, over there, the

25:35.315 --> 25:39.220
press, These are under the information service.

25:48.243 --> 25:55.971
OK, the press is part of the government, the agent, 
the process. You know, like here, the President

25:55.991 --> 26:05.742
Reagan had the press, you know, how do you call it? 
Press conference. Yeah, press conference. You

26:10.587 --> 26:28.063
see,

26:10.587 --> 26:28.063
every time, you know, the president had one of the 
staff and the president, you know, to make a

26:10.587 --> 26:28.063
conference for the press conference. Over there, 
the government had some of those under the

26:28.284 --> 26:35.330
information, you know, agency. Okay? So there's 
some time, you know, you cannot You cannot preach,

26:40.270 --> 26:47.658
you know, like here, like the freedom you can tell 
everything. See? The country is doing the work.

26:51.402 --> 26:51.742
See? You have some limited, you know, freedom, but 
you cannot, you know, say everything against the

26:51.762 --> 27:09.822
government, because the government tried to do 
the best it can, even though, in other words, you

26:51.762 --> 27:09.822
know, propaganda by the communists already. Now, 
you don't want to do something more, you know,

27:10.257 --> 27:20.573
that's worse than this, you know, so you just, you 
know, like you make it for the end, you know, for the

27:10.257 --> 27:20.573
company. Yeah. Well, another word, you know, the 
process is freedom, some sort, but not, you know,

27:22.035 --> 27:35.135
totally, you know, like here, you know, that you 
can say everything you want to. Yeah. the events of

27:36.700 --> 27:38.563
the war to the people? Were people aware of what was 
going on? Well, we put, you know, well we do have,

27:42.991 --> 27:50.705
you know, information, you know, like different 
province and different kind of country. We have

27:50.725 --> 28:00.042
people using service in the government, in front 
of people and, you know, what's going on, you know,

27:50.725 --> 28:00.042
with the aid program, you know, from the United 
States and all this and all that, and some of the

28:00.022 --> 28:14.235
programs, you know, the government, you know, 
worked towards, you know, for the, for increasing

28:00.022 --> 28:14.235
the growth, you know, for irrigation, something 
like that, you know. And in the meantime, you know,

28:14.255 --> 28:27.227
we have the work, you know, information, and so we 
can have a picture, you know, a good village, you

28:14.255 --> 28:27.227
know, was overrun by the communists, you know. Did 
religion have

28:27.494 --> 28:40.953
any effect on the war, did you say? Oh, well, in

28:40.973 --> 28:56.995
the, well, there's,

28:40.973 --> 28:56.995
you see in the city, in the Saigon itself, you know, 
we had the religion,

28:59.050 --> 29:22.746
you know, what we call, you know, uprising,

28:59.050 --> 29:22.746
because, you see, the Buddhist religion, some of 
the leaders of the Buddhist religion, They think,

29:24.802 --> 29:40.055
you know, they said, well, the president's

29:24.802 --> 29:40.055
doing, you know, it's, uh, it's don't respect, you 
know, human rights, you know, because they

29:24.802 --> 29:40.055
detained, you know, dissident, you know, 
political dissident. And, uh, and, you know, the,

29:40.075 --> 29:54.808
uh, Buddhism is one of the religions that does not 
believe in violence and Buddhism, they might be

29:55.160 --> 30:05.199
not aware of how the Communists believe in 
religion. Some of the Buddhism leaders think,

30:05.219 --> 30:17.421
well, if we can compromise with the Communists, we 
might have peace.

30:17.620 --> 30:39.696
So, and that was, in a way, we had, I mean, we had a 
type of religion, you know, that just against, you

30:17.620 --> 30:39.696
know, they tried to, you can see, you know, I don't 
know if you watch TV, you know, a day, and you see all

30:17.620 --> 30:39.696
the monks, you know, try to demonstrate, you know, 
against the government. Because this is simply

30:40.638 --> 30:46.398
for the prologue, because of the music, right? 
Because I think, you know, Bowling Green

30:46.418 --> 30:52.960
is not too well-known. But the problem, you know, 
is the president, you know, he had, you know, his

30:53.345 --> 31:06.847
bribe, you know, worked for him. And he cannot act 
alone, you know, because his bribe is like, you

31:07.188 --> 31:14.239
know, a political army. The people,

31:14.506 --> 31:23.157
you know, began to know his story. They go, oh, his 
story, you know, had too much football to use, and,

31:23.177 --> 31:37.776
of course, you know, he had so many problems, you 
know, scandals, you know, people, you know,

31:23.177 --> 31:37.776
scandals, you know, typhoons, you know, 
scandals. And that's why, you know, before the

31:37.797 --> 31:40.480
story of the president, you know, the movie scene, 
the typhoon, Well,

31:40.460 --> 32:07.063
it's like,

31:40.460 --> 32:07.063
you know, to demonstrate,

31:40.460 --> 32:07.063
you know, and to tell, you know, because

31:40.460 --> 32:07.063
the president is, you know, he's cold, you know, 
he's not, you know, he's just sitting around with

31:40.460 --> 32:07.063
the same kind of people, you know. All this, well, 
you can tell those people, though, Because only

32:09.552 --> 32:27.933
religious people, because they think the 
country, you know, can

32:09.552 --> 32:27.933
have compromise, you know, with the communists. 
But it's not true. Because the communists are

32:29.715 --> 32:33.339
children, you know, they want us, you know, to be 
religious. Right, right. And they had so-called,

32:34.747 --> 32:46.487
you know, actually, they didn't have some peace, 
you know, over Congress. But, those, those peace,

32:47.950 --> 32:56.164
you know, it's, it's more or less, you know, it's 
about a propaganda program, you know, that's not

32:47.950 --> 32:56.164
going to have the freedom to talk to, you know, 
those people.

32:59.452 --> 33:25.875
See, because everything in the communist now, you 
see, like another day, I watched in TV, they think

32:59.452 --> 33:25.875
that a couple of Americans, it's not, you know, a, 
not a veteran, both come back from Vietnam War,

32:59.452 --> 33:25.875
well, more than a veteran, they become civilians, 
and they came to visit the North Vietnamese. Who,

33:25.895 --> 33:26.475
who they were? Well, some of the Americans, you 
know, veterans. The poor boys? Yeah. And you know

33:30.130 --> 33:35.459
what they told them? They told them to go to a wrong 
place, you know, they saw all the trophies,

33:35.479 --> 33:49.262
you know, all the American airplanes, they were 
shut down, and then they just moved on. And if they

33:49.282 --> 33:52.628
were making them, it's serious. I don't

33:54.262 --> 34:04.462
know, he fired a policeman. It was huge, you know, 
sometimes, you know, they had to take a very rich

34:04.943 --> 34:08.950
policeman. Yeah. And, um, and those guys, you 
know, and, um, there were other, both times, you

34:09.111 --> 34:13.519
know, there were very nice people, you know, not 
getting on the very time, you know, you know. We

34:14.022 --> 34:24.198
feel sorry because we tend to come back, you know, 
you know, those innocent people, you know, that.

34:24.218 --> 34:28.104
But they don't realize, you know, who in the world. 
And those are the same people, you know, that

34:28.124 --> 34:35.255
intend, you know, to fight, to fight, you know. 
Every single population is one fighter.

34:41.782 --> 34:45.386
Everybody had it. Yeah. You see, every woman in 
North Carolina, they're not the only child.

34:52.093 --> 34:54.416
They're not the only ones. They're children, but 
they have to go. See, they walked in the rice

34:56.558 --> 34:59.241
fields, and they have to go. Every time there's an 
airplane, they have to go along for the airplane

34:59.261 --> 35:03.386
time. And everybody, you know, got to go and shoot 
at the airport. One more question then. I don't

35:13.835 --> 35:19.860
know if you answered this. Can you give me a 
personal account of your last day in Vietnam? How

35:27.427 --> 35:33.893
you felt about what happened and what you thought 
about the future? The future of Vietnam? Yeah,

35:35.595 --> 35:36.696
just overall.

35:39.224 --> 36:06.514
Well,

35:39.224 --> 36:06.514
see,

35:39.224 --> 36:06.514
I don't think, you know, times,

35:39.224 --> 36:06.514
you know, that Iran has become, you know, a free 
country, you

35:39.224 --> 36:06.514
know, unless there may be change, you know, in the 
global world, you

35:39.224 --> 36:06.514
know, because, Now, Vietnam, you know, has a big 
communist China, you know, right at the back. Now,

36:16.515 --> 36:21.870
it's not, it's, China becomes not communist, you 
know. but might we have a chance, you know, the

36:22.846 --> 36:33.944
Vietnam, you know, leader, a communist Vietnam, 
you know, might be, might be a little more, you

36:22.846 --> 36:33.944
know, flexible. More freedom? You know, more, I 
don't, I don't, I don't say freedom, you know,

36:34.505 --> 36:43.761
because it's communist, you know, you don't have 
freedom. But, but otherwise, you know, The North

36:47.281 --> 36:58.676
Vietnam, the time of Vietnam, it didn't hit the 
bush as much as it did before. I didn't see anything

36:58.696 --> 37:00.078
in the sea. You didn't see anything in the sea? So 
you were very pessimistic for them? For mine, you

37:06.086 --> 37:08.349
know, I can think of me when I look. Actually, you 
know, There are some movements,

37:12.627 --> 37:30.583
you know, the Vilnius, you know, try to fight, you 
know, back with the communists, but they don't

37:12.627 --> 37:30.583
have any support. They don't have any support 
then, because the only country that can support

37:30.664 --> 37:34.107
them is the United States. But I don't think, you 
know, the United States, you know, will find

37:34.127 --> 37:40.112
anywhere in Vietnam, you know, by helping the 
Vilnius. Because for Vietnam, you know, it's

37:40.132 --> 37:42.094
very, very rough. The one thing, the future, you 
know, that I can see,

37:42.361 --> 38:03.137
well, sooner or later,

37:42.361 --> 38:03.137
the United States, you know, will have relations, 
you know, with the Communist Party, you know, like

37:42.361 --> 38:03.137
the work that we're working on in the Gulf, in this 
country. And I don't know, you know, what the

38:04.062 --> 38:19.165
United States can

38:04.062 --> 38:19.165
do again, you know, in relation to the economy of 
Vietnam. I don't see any benefits, you know. But

38:20.166 --> 38:23.932
there will be benefits for Vietnam, won't there? 
Neither, I don't think. Neither? Well, for the

38:26.496 --> 38:32.365
people living over there,

38:26.496 --> 38:32.365
well, actually...

38:36.530 --> 38:50.826
Okay, if they have diplomatic relations with 
China, now it depends on what kind of relations,

38:36.530 --> 38:50.826
you know, if all is cultural, um over here you know 
this is

39:15.241 --> 39:24.230
Unless, you know, though there's little of that 
change, you know, there's a whole concept. You

39:24.430 --> 39:44.950
say, well, now if we, we

39:24.430 --> 39:44.950
just try to, you know, to have some relations with 
the United States, you know, we might be, you know,

39:24.430 --> 39:44.950
tonight, you know, have to rebuild the country, 
or, you know, to have something like that. Yeah. I

39:47.523 --> 39:55.913
don't think so, because they're so, they're so 
tied up, you know, with rituals, you know, with

39:47.523 --> 39:55.913
traditions. Yeah. And then you become so, you 
know, like, you become polite, you know, with

39:56.053 --> 40:02.280
rituals. Like here, in this part of the country, 
you know, you think one of these days, you know,

40:02.320 --> 40:13.092
people come to us and say, okay, now, we're going to 
sit down and talk to them, you know.

40:16.480 --> 40:21.311
I don't think so.

40:24.920 --> 40:30.152
As long as they lead

40:24.920 --> 40:30.152
to worship. I don't know how many

40:32.579 --> 40:43.333
millions, you know, every year, you know, to go out 
and get, you know. So, I don't think

40:43.914 --> 40:54.148
that's simply, you know, to say, okay, now, come 
on, you know, relations, the kind of relations,

40:43.914 --> 40:54.148
you know, you know, I wish I could, you know, you 
know.

41:01.975 --> 41:06.181
See, for us, you know, for us, it's easy. We came 
over here. And,

41:10.947 --> 41:27.990
well, there's some people, you

41:10.947 --> 41:27.990
know, who didn't have, you know, one day, you know, 
a good one, because, you know, it's not, you know,

41:10.947 --> 41:27.990
liberal or whatever, you know, so they can come 
back to the bed. For me, I didn't do that. Yeah, no,

41:28.771 --> 41:29.552
you already got that. I don't believe it. Because, 
you know, because when a communist country

41:33.657 --> 41:44.469
becomes like Cuba,

41:33.657 --> 41:44.469
you can go back in there and you know, it's 
religious. But you don't have

41:46.211 --> 41:51.297
any protection. Yeah. Especially since it's not a 
country. Relations to the country, right? Yeah.

41:55.262 --> 41:57.244
Because, uh, You see, actually, I can see, you 
know, the relationship between the two

41:58.979 --> 42:06.511
countries. I don't, I don't see, you know, a very 
good relationship, you know, like the United

42:06.531 --> 42:20.574
States with the,

42:06.531 --> 42:20.574
with other countries, you know, in the future. 
Sure. Because maybe another country like Romania

42:21.642 --> 42:34.917
or Czechoslovakia can have a good relationship 
with the United States.

42:34.937 --> 42:48.072
Because for my thinking,

42:34.937 --> 42:48.072
another state think if they had good relation with 
the economy of Vietnam, There might be more

42:49.047 --> 42:59.192
information about

42:49.047 --> 42:59.192

the communists, you know, fought to leave over

43:22.791 --> 43:27.841
there. And they had families. Even

43:32.703 --> 43:45.408
though I've been married with one of the 
Vietnamese, but I don't have children. Then you

43:45.429 --> 43:53.344
