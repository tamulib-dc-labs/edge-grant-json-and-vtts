WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:08.585
I said, I told you that I traded that, and you can 
have whatever you can get out of it. So that's what

00:09.686 --> 00:10.668
happened. He got me that Marine air wing in, and 
that helped a lot. What about the B-52s now? B-52s,

00:15.434 --> 00:19.179
I got all of those for 30 hours. And sure enough, the 
enemy attacked at 5.30 in the morning.

00:26.369 --> 00:32.637
And to give you an idea about what you learn about 
the enemy, how they're going to work, and where

00:33.072 --> 00:37.457
they're going to hit you, and how they fight. You 
accumulate this knowledge over a period of time.

00:46.007 --> 01:01.425
I ran northeast of town a B-52 strike at 5.30 in the 
morning when they were attacking, and I aimed that

00:46.007 --> 01:01.425
at a VC regiment. that I knew that was in that area 
because of my radio intercept capability. And I

01:10.042 --> 01:11.965
knew they were going to be attacking. And I wanted 
to coordinate a strike of three B-52s with

01:13.567 --> 01:26.265
108 500 pounders on each B-52

01:28.507 --> 01:33.714
in an area 500 meters wide and 1,500 meters long. 
500 meters wide and 1,500 meters long. I wanted to

01:37.659 --> 01:42.506
concentrate all those bombs in there right on that 
damn regiment. Must have made just one crater.

01:45.049 --> 01:45.550
Almost. Well, what happened was I found out later 
that I had a little captain, 33 Rangers left out of

01:58.426 --> 02:03.612
600 protecting that area. Started out on it back on 
the 5th of April with 600 Rangers there and my one

02:03.652 --> 02:11.562
little American captain advisor. Now I'm down to a 
little American captain and 33 Vietnamese

02:12.123 --> 02:22.856
Rangers and they're gonna be hit by this regiment.

02:22.876 --> 02:26.020
Well, that strike Went in right on time at 5.30. And 
lo and behold, I caught only the leading scout

02:30.841 --> 02:42.075
elements of this regiment.

02:42.096 --> 02:49.645
And pretty well mutilated them except one little 
lieutenant with blood. You know, that concussion

02:50.466 --> 02:53.931
is pretty tough from that amount of stuff. blood 
coming from his ears and from his nose just kept

02:54.434 --> 03:05.148
moving forward and the 33 Rangers, they picked him 
up. He gave up. He was a VC. Yeah, he was a VC. So he

03:08.772 --> 03:20.307
said to them,

03:08.772 --> 03:20.307
you hit the leading elements and the instructions 
were that everybody in the regiment go get in those

03:20.692 --> 03:27.101
holes because they know that that guy is not going 
to strike again in the same place. Now this is at 10

03:27.722 --> 03:28.964
o'clock.

03:32.629 --> 03:43.084
Word came to me, I was airborne in the area, ducking 
SA-7 missiles, handheld missiles, and 51

03:32.629 --> 03:43.084
caliber. They were shooting handheld missiles? 
Yeah, anything that's flying But I had to be here.

03:50.121 --> 03:50.922
Were you taking some hits? Huh? You must have been 
taking some hits. Oh, they knocked down five of

03:52.805 --> 03:55.409
them, our Cobra helicopters. Just cut them out of 
the sky.

04:02.400 --> 04:07.788
So, American captain called the general, you 
know, dick around. You call the guy that can do

04:07.808 --> 04:09.872
things. He said, here's what it is, and they're in 
those holes. And this is at 10 o'clock. I said,

04:15.100 --> 04:16.963
Roger, thank you very much. I said, uh, Thank you 
very, very much. And I looked on my schedule B-52s.

04:25.386 --> 04:34.641
At 10.50 I had another flight coming in, coming in 
every 55 minutes. And now, remember, it takes two

04:37.051 --> 04:50.065
hours, ordinary time, two hours, and you check 
with everybody in the world to divert one flight

04:37.051 --> 04:50.065
from one place to another of three birds. Two 
hours. To show you how professional our United

04:51.446 --> 05:05.421
States Air Force is and the Strategic Air Command, 
I called in direct and bypassed every guy in the

04:51.446 --> 05:05.421
whole chain of the Air Force and said, Here's the 
situation. Call them direct in the air. And you

05:10.823 --> 05:13.005
were talking to Saigon? I was talking, no, hell, I 
was talking to the leader of the flight. And Saigon

05:18.752 --> 05:20.534
was monitoring. And I said, here's the situation. 
I got a whole regiment in the holes of strike number

05:23.337 --> 05:28.603
such and such this morning. I want this strike 
diverted. using same data, same basis as strike

05:34.628 --> 05:42.376
number such and such at 0530.

05:44.559 --> 05:45.440
Roger that. They had 20 minutes to divert, change 
the course, came in, dropped,

05:46.341 --> 06:02.138
and after it was all over with on the 18th of May, 
only 13 members of that whole regiment survived.

06:09.845 --> 06:13.829
13 members out of about 2,100 survived.

06:16.572 --> 06:28.765
Now that's what you have to do to win and you know 
what one regiment would do against 33 little

06:16.572 --> 06:28.765
Rangers and one little American captain.

06:31.547 --> 06:32.108
So You know, whatever you do, wherever you are, 
military or otherwise, you can succeed. It all

06:41.189 --> 06:46.435
depends on how bad you want to do it, you know. Tell 
me about the rest of the Viet Cong and the rest of the

06:46.475 --> 06:55.446
North Vietnamese force in the area now. Didn't 
they attack? Oh hell, they were attacking all the

06:57.459 --> 06:59.581
time. And as I say, it took 30 hours. There were 55 
minutes, three B-52s. And some, and we extended

07:07.709 --> 07:11.773
some a little bit beyond that. But I interlaced in a 
24-hour period 399 sorties of attack air against

07:11.833 --> 07:22.463
their tanks. We knocked the little Vietnamese, 
took the little old light anti-tank weapon that

07:23.168 --> 07:35.125
nobody said was any good, the Law, and they knocked 
out those guys in town. I showed you the picture of

07:35.265 --> 07:37.368
some of them. Knocked the guys out in town. We 
knocked one out by air, a guy named Gordy Weed, a

07:40.333 --> 07:51.589
lieutenant colonel in the United States Air 
Force, phenomenal pilot. and ground support guy

07:52.126 --> 07:57.052
with what we called an old T-38 trainer. We had 
converted some of those to combat and they were

07:57.132 --> 08:17.015
carrying bombs and the weather is down and nobody 
could fly, but he was up with a flight and he came in

07:57.132 --> 08:17.015
and he said, we said, there's a tank just outside of 
the headquarters. And he said, how much clearance

08:17.075 --> 08:19.958
I got from friendlies? And we said, all you need And 
he knocked that tank out about 200 meters from the

08:22.147 --> 08:30.779
headquarters there, which could have killed off 
all my communications. And then when you lose your

08:30.819 --> 08:37.988
communications, you're in a hell of a shape.

08:39.510 --> 08:51.006
Later on, after things subsided, Sir Robert 
Thompson, advisor to, and a great personal friend

08:39.510 --> 08:51.006
of mine, and I love him so much, Sir Robert Thompson 
from England was advisor to the President of the

08:51.458 --> 08:56.323
United States. The President sent him over, and 
the President, he said, the President asked me to

08:56.363 --> 09:15.522
ask you to take me into UNLOCK because this will be a 
very convincing thing to the world that you won the

08:56.363 --> 09:15.522
war. And I did. I've got some pictures of him in 
there with the province chief who was a brigadier

09:20.197 --> 09:28.866
who had promoted the brigadier. He was a Marine 
Corps colonel at the time as province chief.

09:35.012 --> 09:43.421
And then I had to secretly, unbeknownst to the 
United States, take in the president. What? Take

09:44.282 --> 09:47.605
in the president of Vietnam into on-law. He didn't 
trust his own people. No, you took President Two

09:50.762 --> 09:52.684
in? Took President Two in, yes, on the 7th of July. 
No kidding. Yes. But tell me about that. What kind

09:59.173 --> 10:00.154
of person was he? How was his setting? I thought he 
was a phenomenal man. I thought he was a great,

10:03.478 --> 10:14.993
great man, a great presence, dedicated to his 
country and to very gracious and kind to the United

10:03.478 --> 10:14.993
States. They had tried to get him to relieve this 
corps commander because everybody thought I

10:16.525 --> 10:24.425
ought to have some help. I didn't need any damn 
help. I just needed to be left alone, but this was a

10:32.624 --> 10:52.574
Me commanding that corps, you know, was gonna leak 
out to the press, which it did, and I denied that I

10:32.624 --> 10:52.574
was commanding the corps, and then I went and got 
this sick lieutenant general and got some

10:32.624 --> 10:52.574
pictures of him giving me instructions and me 
saluting, you know, to prove that I wasn't

10:32.624 --> 10:52.574
commanding the corps, but I was all hogwash. 
Everybody knew, Abrams knew, Dick Nixon knew,

10:53.796 --> 11:01.888
everybody knew I was commanding that damn outfit, 
and they were trying to get two, every one of them,

11:02.324 --> 11:09.453
went to him to try to get two to relieve this guy. His 
name was Min, M-I-N-N-A.

11:15.140 --> 11:18.884
He's now caretaker of St. Patrick's Cathedral in 
New York. Really? Yes. He and his family. So, uh, I,

11:23.470 --> 11:27.555
uh, Of course, it denied commanding the forces. I 
rather enjoyed it. I mean, hell, it's a goddamn

11:32.736 --> 11:35.781
good challenge for me. You know,

11:36.862 --> 11:42.691
it's a difficult task. I don't think anybody could 
have done it but me. That's what Abram said. And

11:46.097 --> 11:51.685
they're probably right.

11:51.705 --> 11:54.049
Because you just don't find anybody... really in 
the world today include the goddamn Soviets that

11:54.974 --> 12:01.061
had the combat experience that I have and at the 
levels.

12:03.745 --> 12:09.632
And know how to use air power, which is the key of the 
whole thing, is firepower. And how to deliver it

12:09.992 --> 12:13.817
and where to deliver it and what the enemy's gonna 
do. You gotta know what the enemy's gonna do. You

12:16.861 --> 12:22.508
can't go drop bombs out here and bust up the woods 
and the enemy's over here. You gotta know how in the

12:22.548 --> 12:23.749
hell to do it.

12:27.644 --> 12:28.965
You've got to have a personal feel of him. You've 
got to have your hands on him all the time, and with

12:29.186 --> 12:36.474
the electronics capability we have today, you can 
keep a hand on him if you know how to use him. That's

12:36.494 --> 12:48.727
a, I've got a, and then let me see now, so you left,

12:36.494 --> 12:48.727
you left Vietnam just about three or four months 
after that episode. Yeah, a very interesting

12:49.749 --> 12:56.436
thing, I had my eyes blown away, and I lost this eye 
totally on the 6th of April from from rocket fire in

12:56.838 --> 12:58.680
Onlock. And I didn't know it, but it gradually just 
went out on me. The shade went down, it was gone.

13:05.146 --> 13:06.868
What it was was a detached retina. Well, the 
drawdown over there, we had no ophthalmologist

13:07.849 --> 13:11.192
over there. And I thought, well, maybe this eye is 
just tired. It's gone, I can't see it. I've only got

13:15.877 --> 13:19.360
one eye left. So, it's gone. So, finally they got a a 
hippie type ophthalmologist that had refused the

13:24.040 --> 13:32.930
draft and refused this and that and the other. He 
had accepted military paid for medical schooling

13:32.970 --> 13:39.818
and so on and so forth. He needed Walter Reed and he 
didn't want to go to Vietnam and he revolted and

13:39.838 --> 13:48.428
they tried his ass and as a result they sentenced 
him to go to Vietnam. Oh, what a sentence. Yeah, and

13:51.069 --> 14:00.778
the son of a bitch got in there in August, and the war 
looked like it was over with at that time, so I said,

13:51.069 --> 14:00.778
well, I better go down there. They said they had to 
optimize it. I'll go down, and he takes a look at my

14:02.419 --> 14:08.845
eye, and he said, oh, my God, I've got to get you out 
of here right now. He said, you've got 90% detached

14:08.865 --> 14:13.810
retina, and he said, it's gone. He said, when did 
this occur? I said, well, it started occurring

14:16.933 --> 14:19.495
back on the 6th of April. Well, why didn't you come 
in? I said, for what? I said, nobody here. And

14:25.294 --> 14:29.079
everybody's hollering at me to keep the people out 
of Saigon. What the hell am I going to do? I go do what

14:31.944 --> 14:35.088
I'm supposed to do, and to hell with my damned eye. 
He said, well, you've got to get to Walter Reed

14:36.931 --> 14:40.396
right now. That's on the afternoon of August 31st. 
And by God, believe it or not, Vietnamese

14:50.052 --> 15:00.250
presented me their third highest award the next 
morning, and I was on the airplane and gone home to

14:50.052 --> 15:00.250
Walter Reed. I stayed in Walter Reed

15:00.270 --> 15:14.676
until December the 22nd,

15:00.270 --> 15:14.676
and finally got this high back to about 2250.

15:17.086 --> 15:20.069
now General Abrams, Chief of Staff of the Army. He 
comes out to see me. He said, I'm going to send you

15:26.174 --> 15:32.040
down to Fort Sam Houston to rest up for a few months. 
I said, well, I don't think I've got but one eye

15:33.361 --> 15:36.144
left. I think I'll just get out. He said, I'll tell 
you what to do. You don't tell me. He said, I'd

15:46.516 --> 15:51.361
rather have you with one eye than most people with 
three.

15:55.585 --> 16:05.334
And he said, you keep your mouth shut, you son of a 
bitch, but I'm going to give you that tactical army

15:55.585 --> 16:05.334
command and promote you in Korea. You go down there 
and get rested up. You sorry bastard. I said, yes,

16:13.702 --> 16:14.383
sir. I'd land in the goddamn bed. Still a patch of 
mine. Here's Chief of Staff of the Army, and I'll

16:18.464 --> 16:22.269
talk to you like that. Well, we knew each other very 
well. So I went down there. First of July, 1973,

16:26.914 --> 16:33.563
word come down, promote him. Get him to Korea right 
away. So we'll do that one tomorrow, okay? Yeah,

16:39.690 --> 16:43.335
but I want to ask you some questions about Vietnam. 
Sure. about just Vietnam in general, and you can

16:44.127 --> 16:49.434
stop whenever you want. If you're getting tired of 
this, that's okay. Well, it's about six o'clock.

16:53.960 --> 16:54.301
Oh, okay. Do you want to stop then? I can start. I can 
answer these questions. Let's hit them early in

16:57.906 --> 16:59.288
the morning. I'll be glad to answer them though. 
It's August 20th, Friday. And this is the third

17:05.407 --> 17:08.231
interview with General Hollingsworth. And I 
wanted to start off on something that you said. And

17:12.557 --> 17:14.600
I can't remember if I got it on tape or not. If we did, 
we can just edit this out. And that is that you said,

17:17.844 --> 17:29.200
after on lock, that someone said that there's only 
two fighting generals left in the Army, you and

17:17.844 --> 17:29.200
Abrams. Now, who, when, and where? That was Ward 
Just in his book. And I think, I want to have a copy of

17:36.203 --> 17:41.749
that, but I'm not certain. What book was this one 
that he wrote? War Just, I think it was War and

17:43.631 --> 17:49.938
People, I believe that was the name of it. I think 
you just have to look through the library. I can't

17:56.224 --> 18:01.570
recall it right off. But that was his comment. 
What's your feelings about that comment?

18:11.175 --> 18:19.307
Well, Abrams and I had been considered the two best 
tank leaders in World War II. And I don't think

18:21.850 --> 18:29.201
either one of us had backed away from the fact that 
we probably were. You see? Yeah. And that

18:32.870 --> 18:47.593
we

18:32.870 --> 18:47.593
never talked about it,

18:32.870 --> 18:47.593
but I think we enjoyed the fact that others did. And

18:49.195 --> 19:00.312
this came, I guess, from our aggressive attitudes

18:49.195 --> 19:00.312
initiative. intuitive ways of feeling and seeing 
a problem and I guess some God given attributes in

19:01.439 --> 19:29.725
this regard for having a personal feel for people 
and what it takes to be successful in battle and

19:01.439 --> 19:29.725
I'll have to say that I give credit to the big man on 
high for looking after a very young fellow who'd

19:31.426 --> 19:44.924
had no experience in warfare, wasn't frightened 
of it, but learned, took advantage of the everyday

19:31.426 --> 19:44.924
to learn something and then to apply it. And I am 
very grateful for that. It makes you feel you're

19:55.625 --> 20:01.376
destined to do things and do something and that you 
just continue to go. That's the reason I just

20:01.917 --> 20:08.109
continue to work now and financially I don't have 
to. But

20:08.169 --> 20:17.446
in my own mind I haven't accomplished anything yet 
so I'm still looking to accomplish something. No,

20:17.927 --> 20:18.949
no. Did you ever receive a survey from a brigadier 
general named Douglas Kinnard, K-I-N-N-A-R-D,

20:19.520 --> 20:34.100
asking you to comment about a number of different 
topics of Vietnam after the war was over? The

20:34.120 --> 20:36.843
survey probably went out in 1975 or so. Possibly I 
did, yes. But you don't remember? I don't remember

20:40.949 --> 20:42.351
specifically. Well, Kinnard wrote a book called 
The War Managers, and there is... There were other

20:47.667 --> 20:56.120
two colonels who wrote a book on the Army who were in 
Vietnam and then retired and wrote a book on the

20:47.667 --> 20:56.120
Army. And for the most part, these books take the 
Army to task and bring out some real problems,

20:56.440 --> 21:09.039
which I'd like to ask you about. Sure. These are 
military men saying that things went wrong and

21:09.700 --> 21:16.510
everybody is to blame, but part of it was the 
military. And so I'd like to ask you about some of

21:17.384 --> 21:21.290
these things. One is careerism. As you know, the 
combat tour of duty, for the most part, was six

21:22.932 --> 21:29.762
months. And a number of these critics say that six 
months just wasn't long enough to get to know your

21:30.823 --> 21:42.500
men, get to know the area that you were in command 
of, and go out and do a good job. You should have been

21:42.801 --> 21:44.964
in command for a much longer time. What's your 
response to that? I totally agree with that if

21:48.248 --> 21:51.493
you're in the United States in training.

21:55.099 --> 21:57.743
But you're supposed to be trained before you go to 
combat. And if you're trying to train in combat and

22:00.046 --> 22:07.959
getting soldiers killed, that's when General 
Hollingsworth would relieve you so damn quick it

22:00.046 --> 22:07.959
wasn't even funny.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.947
That was no training ground for commanders. That 
was a battleground. and uh and a commander going

22:16.919 --> 22:46.690
over to learn to command a battalion in battle and 
get men killed I wouldn't tolerate that 30 minutes

22:16.919 --> 22:46.690
and that's the reason why I was criticized for 
relieving so many battalion commanders I didn't

22:16.919 --> 22:46.690
relieve many I just relieved those who uh that 
needed to be relieved those who after 30 to 60 days

22:16.919 --> 22:46.690
were still doing foolish things and getting men 
and his life's in jeopardy, and so he needed to be

22:47.581 --> 22:56.996
relieved. It was in his own best interest that he be 
relieved of that responsibility.

23:05.710 --> 23:08.034
So, was this typical that you'd have to relieve? I 
mean, were there a lot of untrained people?

23:10.987 --> 23:14.312
Because the command was only six months? Well, it 
really wasn't six months. It really wasn't six

23:16.675 --> 23:18.378
months. It depended a lot on the capabilities of 
the individual.

23:25.088 --> 23:39.930
I can tell you that I can name off 25

23:25.088 --> 23:39.930
or 30 battalion commanders that had 12 months of 
command over there. And I'll tell you, it's a

23:41.024 --> 23:57.907
devastating thing for a man that was fighting 
every day, 45 years old, or 40 years old as a

23:41.024 --> 23:57.907
lieutenant colonel, fighting every day with 18 
and 19-year-olds through the jungle. And I don't

23:58.648 --> 24:08.061
care how physically fit you are or how tough you 
think you are, it's one hell of a mental and

23:58.648 --> 24:08.061
physical battle for a 40-year-old. I requested 
that the Army provide the 1st Infantry Division,

24:08.615 --> 24:19.104
and General DePue did the same thing, that we have 
30-year-old battalion commanders. And the Chief

24:20.085 --> 24:25.230
of Staff of the Army came back and said, the Army 
cannot meet your requirements.

24:27.452 --> 24:35.579
And I thought to myself, here you are conducting a 
peacetime promotion and career officer program

24:27.452 --> 24:35.579
in a war zone. And this makes no sense to anybody. A 
good commander should have been left over there. A

24:43.301 --> 24:58.836
good captain, company commander, should have 
been left over there until he commanded the

24:43.301 --> 24:58.836
division if the war lasted that long enough and he 
was physically and mentally fit and promote him

24:43.301 --> 24:58.836
every six months if necessary depending on his 
capabilities. That's what they did to me during

24:59.216 --> 25:04.461
the war and there's no reason why you shouldn't 
have done that over there. There was no such thing

25:05.142 --> 25:09.486
as a career when I was in World War II. And the same 
thing in Korea. So there is what Kennerly is

25:13.049 --> 25:24.348
probably talking about, these people are talking 
about, that it's just wrong as hell to run a

25:13.049 --> 25:24.348
peacetime situation in a war. In other words, the 
idea of giving a man a year tour of duty in Vietnam,

25:25.069 --> 25:30.618
you're against. Do you think that the man should 
stay there for the duration and instead of trying

25:30.638 --> 25:37.009
to run it like... Like part of his career, it should 
be run as a war. As a war, absolutely. And if he's a

25:43.954 --> 25:59.987
captain and he's doing great things and doing a 
magnificent job taking objectives, destroying

25:43.954 --> 25:59.987
the enemy's capability and saving his soldiers' 
lives, after six months, promote him. After six

26:01.288 --> 26:04.691
months more, promote him if he's doing a good job. 
At the same time, if he isn't, get rid of him. I got

26:07.651 --> 26:10.455
rid of them, but we had no promotion authority. Oh, 
none at all. None at all. So that was a bad aspect of

26:15.942 --> 26:28.038
management

26:15.942 --> 26:28.038
of that conflict.

26:28.058 --> 26:31.443
And it hurt the capability of the units. I spent 15 
months in the first division going day and night

26:36.608 --> 26:43.936
and I was 40 some odd years old I guess. Now there's 
another thing that I'm wondering about when we had

26:44.817 --> 27:02.515
the most number of troops there in 1969 although we 
had 560 or so thousand troops there we only had

26:44.817 --> 27:02.515
80,000 troops that were in direct combat We had a 
hell of a lot of troops there that were in supply.

27:09.134 --> 27:09.554
Why? This is a much higher ratio than the Second 
World War. Well,

27:13.098 --> 27:20.224
again, it gets back to running a peacetime 
situation. They even had the inspector general

27:20.244 --> 27:26.890
teams over there coming around inspecting the 
units as if you were in the United States.

27:30.032 --> 27:31.894
What the hell kind of business is that? In a wartime 
situation, I flew out of battle one day back to

27:33.055 --> 27:42.792
entertain the inspector generals who had been in 
the division. But I never noted one damn one of them

27:43.132 --> 27:49.503
up in the battalions that were in contact 
anywhere. But it had up our logistics people and

27:50.986 --> 27:58.759
administrative people tied up in knots back there 
with the inspector general team. eight or ten

27:59.498 --> 28:10.610
colonels that nobody knew what the hell to do with 
that was over there getting their months off in

27:59.498 --> 28:10.610
Vietnam and their headquarters and going back. 
The other aspect of this thing had to do with the

28:11.291 --> 28:22.603
number of personnel that were involved in a 
civilian in the cords group, rural development

28:23.680 --> 28:33.554
group, the province advisors, and their teams 
were all involved in this. I think they counted

28:34.416 --> 28:42.467
those in the non-combat area along with all the 
supply people and the huge headquarters that you

28:34.416 --> 28:42.467
had. It's a very interesting thing, even in a 
combat division,

28:52.891 --> 28:55.675
small percentage of people get in combat. I

28:56.556 --> 29:02.304
think it's too heavy in our army. I have never been 
against

29:04.627 --> 29:17.245
delivering ice cream to soldiers on a battle area, 
but I think it's the sort of thing you can get along

29:04.627 --> 29:17.245
without. Do you think, that's another one of the 
criticisms, that there were a number of supply

29:17.545 --> 29:44.953
generals who would say that our troops have never 
been treated so well in a battle area, our troops,

29:17.545 --> 29:44.953
they can have movies, they can have this, they can 
have, when they have R&R, they can go to really nice

29:17.545 --> 29:44.953
places, and this is war, and did you witness how 
well, I mean, the idea of trying to give a man out in

29:45.440 --> 29:53.149
the field one hot meal a day, which was policy. 
What'd you think about those things, being a World

29:54.770 --> 29:58.074
War II veteran? Well, I, of course, went through 
different kind of conditions.

30:09.307 --> 30:14.012
I got no objection to it, as long as it doesn't 
interfere with our overall mission of fighting

30:14.431 --> 30:15.292
the war. Did it interfere? I don't think it did. Oh, 
good. As far as I'm concerned, it didn't. And also,

30:21.482 --> 30:40.152
I want to assure you that never in the history of 
warfare in the history of the world have soldiers,

30:21.482 --> 30:40.152
sailors, and airmen, Marines, ever received such 
phenomenal support. as they received during the

30:41.752 --> 30:44.496
Vietnam conflict. It's a result of a great

30:46.379 --> 31:08.350
fluency on the part of our way of life, and I'm 
afraid we have pushed ourselves into this soft

31:09.443 --> 31:14.871
requirement area.

31:18.397 --> 31:30.996
We know that we can get along without them because 
we did during World War II and to a large degree

31:18.397 --> 31:30.996
during the Korea conflict.

31:31.735 --> 31:33.759
We've brought a lot of this on. This is a reflection 
of our society? Of our society. It's just a pure and

31:36.785 --> 31:39.691
simple reflection of it. Now there has been some 
statements that a number of officers in Vietnam

31:39.711 --> 31:48.428
went there to get their ticket punched, and I'm 
sure that you've heard that. before. They wanted

31:49.783 --> 31:55.812
that on their record because it certainly helped 
their careers in promotion. Did you have examples

31:55.832 --> 31:59.537
of, or do you have examples of that? Were there 
people like that that you met? If I had any, if I knew

32:02.161 --> 32:09.972
about them, I wouldn't accept them as a commander, 
as battalion commanders. The 1st Infantry

32:09.992 --> 32:17.402
Division being the oldest division in the United 
States and also being of such great pride, and we

32:19.070 --> 32:27.819
say in the First Division, setting the example for 
the rest of the Army. We

32:29.701 --> 32:48.621
were very selective about who comes to that 
division in combat, and we turned down hundreds of

32:29.701 --> 32:48.621
officers that tried to get in that division, 
including general officers. In fact, the matter

32:48.888 --> 33:08.849
is, one time when there was going to be a division 
commander change, the division commander at that

32:48.888 --> 33:08.849
time and myself turned thumbs down on fourteen 
different generals coming to that division. No

33:09.269 --> 33:10.230
kidding? Absolutely. You had the power to do that? 
We did it. When they sent a general out with orders?

33:16.637 --> 33:17.839
They wouldn't send him out. They'd send his name 
over. With a service record? Yeah. And you'd look

33:23.109 --> 33:26.075
through there and you'd say yes or no? I said no. Was 
this typical? No. I didn't think so. No, no. How'd

33:33.609 --> 33:36.715
you get away with it? The division commander had 
more to say about it than I did. He just showed me the

33:40.311 --> 33:50.543
courtesy of asking me my views.

33:51.283 --> 33:53.686
How did he get away with it? Because a 
commander-in-chief, Comus McVie, asked him.

34:03.644 --> 34:17.097
Now you may not get that done anywhere except 
unless you got a close relationship between the

34:03.644 --> 34:17.097
division commander and the senior commander in 
the field.

34:17.498 --> 34:30.430
And there wasn't anything wrong with these 
officers except

34:17.498 --> 34:30.430
their battle experience didn't permit them, we 
felt, to serve in the first division. So I'll use

34:30.550 --> 34:33.313
that as an example. say to you that the

34:33.952 --> 35:00.988
first division, when you're in combat, as we were, 
you accept what you want and turn down what you

34:33.952 --> 35:00.988
don't want, particularly in the grades of 
lieutenant colonel and above.

35:01.255 --> 35:27.802
another aspect of the war concerning officers, 
and that is that there's a study done comparing the

35:01.255 --> 35:27.802
percentage of officers to enlisted men in World 
War II Korea and Vietnam, and the study found that

35:01.255 --> 35:27.802
twice as high a percentage of officers were in 
Vietnam as the other wars, and that there were more

35:01.255 --> 35:27.802
generals per troops than at any other time in 
American history. Why? Did it help Well, it goes

35:32.018 --> 35:38.646
back to something I mentioned a little earlier. 
Fluency and what you're going to do in a way of

35:40.589 --> 35:51.903
support

35:40.589 --> 35:51.903
for the soldier in the field requires people to do 
it. And secondly, never before in any war that I

35:54.206 --> 36:01.755
participated in have we had teams of officers 
primarily

36:03.845 --> 36:24.047
at each province and each district in the country 
trying to manipulate the mayor and the town

36:03.845 --> 36:24.047
council to get them to bring pressure to bear to get 
rid of VC in the area and also to assist the regional

36:25.057 --> 36:35.754
forces and the popular forces to do that. You see, 
you had Vietnamese divisions, combat forces like

36:36.815 --> 36:49.495
we have, and then you had regional forces, RF 
forces, that's another group, And then you had the

36:50.015 --> 36:54.160
popular forces, which was small groups down in 
there. Well, all those had to be officered and

36:54.240 --> 37:00.488
supervised, so this takes a hell of a lot of people 
to do it. I'd say three times the effort that you

37:00.608 --> 37:13.785
would normally consider necessary,

37:00.608 --> 37:13.785
and that took a lot of people. There are more 
general officers today. Again, our society and

37:17.268 --> 37:22.294
what you have to go through demands that. During 
World War II, we had no NATO.

37:30.623 --> 37:36.089
We had no military advisory groups in every 
country in the world. We had no JCS, where you got

37:37.370 --> 37:41.495
2,000 today. We're almost all officers. A high 
percentage of general is in there. You had no

37:46.580 --> 37:51.708
Department of Defense, which is another three or 
four thousand. You had no officers involved in

37:53.691 --> 37:58.337
equal opportunity. You had no officers involved 
in human rights. You can run down, you had no

38:03.525 --> 38:06.730
insurance officers. You had no legal officers. 
You had no one looking after retired personnel.

38:15.183 --> 38:20.811
You had no one involved in community relations. 
You had no one running the Little Leagues and all

38:22.594 --> 38:30.425
the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts and all that sort 
of thing. But our society had more or less looked to

38:30.465 --> 38:34.370
the military to do that. And somebody, to get it 
done, you got to come up with somebody to do it. And

38:41.901 --> 38:43.924
so I can clearly understand the awesome 
requirements that's placed on the military, and

38:44.208 --> 39:01.671
you find, again,

38:44.208 --> 39:01.671
more colonels, more generals in headquarters. 
Enlisted men are private. Doesn't

39:04.554 --> 39:12.184
contribute a hell of a lot at the cabinet level, 
does he? Private. that we just recruited off the

39:13.081 --> 39:15.284
street out here? No, he's about 25 or 30 years away 
from that. So, in other words, what you're saying

39:21.674 --> 39:35.055
is that the government is giving the military 
expanding responsibilities and bureaucracies,

39:21.674 --> 39:35.055
and therefore they need someone to lead them. And 
the staffs of the United States Senate and the

39:35.373 --> 39:42.119
House of Representatives have gone up by more than 
1,000%. Why? Because of requirements for more of

39:43.981 --> 39:56.173
this and more of that and a better analysis of what 
we're doing than we've ever done before, and

39:43.981 --> 39:56.173
you've got to have somebody to do it. And that's 
just what we run into. Okay, now, some people say

39:58.935 --> 40:03.760
that... One problem with expanding the number of 
officers in Vietnam is that sooner or later, some

40:04.280 --> 40:23.031
of the army, as you know, had to lower requirements 
to get some officers and to get such a number, and

40:04.280 --> 40:23.031
the result was that you got an occasional bad 
apple, somebody like

40:26.808 --> 40:30.794
if it wasn't for the fact of decreasing standards 
now. What do you say about that? What did you think

40:32.076 --> 40:36.763
of the junior officers that you worked with, or 
could you select these two?

40:40.949 --> 40:55.110
We

40:40.949 --> 40:55.110
had an unpublished policy, I guess,

40:40.949 --> 40:55.110
at that time of meeting numbers.

40:58.347 --> 41:25.418
And if it's a policy of meeting numbers,

40:58.347 --> 41:25.418
the fellas, for example, at the artillery school 
and graduating second lieutenants from OCS for

40:58.347 --> 41:25.418
the artillery, they may not agree with it and you 
may have one or two colonels resign and get out, I

40:58.347 --> 41:25.418
mean retire and get out because they don't like 
meeting numbers. Generally speaking, I don't

41:27.322 --> 41:34.471
think anyone does in the Army at meeting numbered 
requirements.

41:37.435 --> 41:44.143
But there were people who graduated as second 
lieutenants who should not have been. And they

41:46.707 --> 41:48.329
were sent to combat. And many of them failed. Many 
of them got relieved and sent out before they

41:55.503 --> 42:08.122
really failed from the standpoint of losing, loss 
of life for someone. Some, unfortunately,

42:08.142 --> 42:21.763
may have committed errors that cost lives and 
that's it. thing that happens in battle that you

42:23.127 --> 42:28.954
try to avoid at all costs.

42:34.900 --> 42:36.142
What do you do? Do you go short on these people or do 
you take a chance?

42:47.114 --> 42:50.738
With me, it's either quality or nothing.

42:53.975 --> 42:59.683
I'm supposed to have 35 officers in a battalion of 
500 or 600 men. I'd rather have 15 officers of high

42:59.743 --> 43:17.509
quality because I've got the ingenuity and 
experience and know-how to maximize that 15's

42:59.743 --> 43:17.509
capability and overcome the shortage of the 20 
that I refuse to accept.

43:20.774 --> 43:22.817
But we had some there that shouldn't have been 
there. No question about it. But on the other hand,

43:25.670 --> 43:29.134
let's look at it this way. Out of probably some 
30,000 to 40,000 second lieutenants, first

43:31.296 --> 43:49.978
lieutenants that served in that war over eight 
years,

43:31.296 --> 43:49.978
one bad apple out of 25,000 to 30,000 had one hell of 
a phenomenal damn record, isn't it? One hell of a

43:50.959 --> 43:53.142
phenomenal record. So something must have 
happened over there with the commanders for those

43:55.282 --> 44:13.046
that did show up over there that weren't 
adequately trained or weren't properly

43:55.282 --> 44:13.046
motivated or that slipped through the system to 
meet quotas. Somebody must have done a hell of a job

44:13.086 --> 44:17.431
over there, didn't they? And I think that's 
what... really happened. Okay now what about the

44:20.775 --> 44:36.554
enlisted man the one-year tour of duty for the 
enlisted man did you did you agree with having the

44:20.775 --> 44:36.554
one-year tour of duty or did you like the officers 
would you have thought that duration of the war was

44:20.775 --> 44:36.554
a better way to go about it? Under the conditions in 
which they were operating climatically and the

44:36.574 --> 44:49.150
type of enemy that you were fighting and the type of 
war that you're fighting I think I think one year

44:50.429 --> 44:56.418
was all right for these, was enough for these young 
men.

44:59.762 --> 45:20.352
I would say that for 90% of the officers, but 
there's somewhere between 10 and 25% of the

44:59.762 --> 45:20.352
officers that I would have kept over there, and I 
say, as long as he's fiddly and mentally sound and

44:59.762 --> 45:20.352
fit, I think he should have been allowed to go home 
every once in a while to see his family. I stayed

45:26.484 --> 45:29.937
away from my family three years during World War 
II.
