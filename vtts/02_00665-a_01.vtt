00:04.790 --> 00:23.473
So now, in definition then of what you consider 
perhaps the three major areas in which

00:04.790 --> 00:23.473
oceanography is going, if you were going to tell a 
young oceanographer what he should stress in his

00:04.790 --> 00:23.473
scientific backgrounds, what would you choose? 
Well, I emphasize that I think oceanography is

00:25.867 --> 00:35.302
going to go several major different ways in 
different sciences. So I think I'd say the same

00:36.223 --> 00:47.681
thing that I was told 20 years ago, that you want to 
get a good strong background in one of the basic

00:36.223 --> 00:47.681
sciences before getting into oceanography. And 
that your value in oceanography will depend to a

00:48.682 --> 00:58.013
large extent on how well you bring those basic 
principles into the field of oceanography.

00:59.214 --> 01:04.720
Because oceanography, as you've alluded to a 
couple of times, is a very broad subject. It

01:04.740 --> 01:06.182
involves all the sciences. But to get into 
oceanography from a generalist point of view

01:07.583 --> 01:14.091
means you don't bring any expertise yourself into 
the field. And therefore, how are you going to

01:14.792 --> 01:16.073
contribute? to advance the field in whatever 
field you might choose. You have to bring an

01:22.532 --> 01:26.601
expertise in one of the fields. So either in 
physics, get a good basic background in physics or

01:26.621 --> 01:31.952
mathematics. or geology, which would be related 
to my field, or in biology or engineering. I think

01:40.878 --> 01:55.255
ocean engineering is kind of a new field, but going 
to be one that's increasingly important, already

01:40.878 --> 01:55.255
is important, in terms of building structures at 
sea, oil wells and things of this sort. One of the

01:56.937 --> 02:02.344
basic sciences or engineering, I think, is going 
to be important. One thing that's come along here

02:02.594 --> 02:09.623
at Woods Hole in the past few years has been a marine 
policy program. And the social aspects of

02:10.825 --> 02:14.970
oceanography are increasingly important. The 
legal aspects of oceanography, in terms of the Law

02:14.990 --> 02:23.201
of the Sea conference that seems to be never 
ending, probably never will end. How are we

02:24.403 --> 02:27.066
limited? How are we going to be limited in the 
future in terms of what we can do research on? We're

02:32.345 --> 02:38.973
already being limited by excluding the 
continental shelves of the world to a large

02:32.345 --> 02:38.973
extent, except off our own shelves. And we're 
going to have to develop political, bilateral

02:40.054 --> 02:46.982
relationships with other countries to be able to 
do research. That's already limited the kind of

02:47.463 --> 02:50.606
work we can do in the oceans. If the 200-mile limit 
is accepted throughout the world, that

02:51.447 --> 02:56.293
essentially closes off about one-third or 
one-quarter of the world's oceans to research.

03:02.519 --> 03:04.683
That's a big chunk. If any country doesn't want 
research done off their shores 200 miles out, they

03:05.203 --> 03:11.814
can exclude any research being done. Whereas 20 
years ago, that was never a problem. That's been a

03:15.761 --> 03:18.265
big change in Oceania. But that's getting a little 
bit off the subject of what you asked me about.

03:21.728 --> 03:27.798
Well, that's all right, because I was going to ask 
you about what you thought limits were to future

03:21.728 --> 03:27.798
oceanographers, in effect. That's a major 
limitation I see right now. Until we can get a major

03:29.762 --> 03:44.607
conference agreement, treaty, or whatever is 
required in the United Nations or elsewhere,

03:29.762 --> 03:44.607
we're going to have to deal, as an institution or as 
if we're running ships, to deal with other

03:45.262 --> 03:55.395
countries to get clearance, either through our 
State Department or directly with the other

03:45.262 --> 03:55.395
countries, probably more likely through our 
State Department. So we're going to have a

03:55.415 --> 04:05.048
bureaucratic limitation of just getting 
permission to work on other countries, in the

03:55.415 --> 04:05.048
territorial waters of other countries. That 
means that everything will be slowed down, I

04:06.190 --> 04:10.095
think. You'll have to request that permission 
years in advance, probably before you can get it.

04:15.451 --> 04:20.396
So it means you have to do your planning much 
farther in advance than we used to do. Instead of

04:20.456 --> 04:27.942
just going out on a cruise, planning it a few months 
ahead of time, you have to plan it years ahead of

04:20.456 --> 04:27.942
time. And that's already happening. We're seeing 
that now. We're getting our own research programs

04:31.245 --> 04:34.548
planned years in advance. Essentially, we're 
coming up to five-year plans, I think, is what

04:35.509 --> 04:38.952
we're doing. Will that limit your data check, for 
example? Suppose you wanted to... You made some

04:43.042 --> 04:49.327
sort of an amazing discovery all at once in heat 
flow, and you wanted to check it out someplace

04:43.042 --> 04:49.327
else. How would you know years in advance to apply 
that discovery? It'll be difficult to do that.

04:55.052 --> 05:04.921
It'll probably have to come about, if you want to go 
to a certain area very quickly, you'll have to work

04:55.052 --> 05:04.921
with another researcher in another country off 
whose shores you want to work. You won't want to

05:05.982 --> 05:06.923
work with. And maybe that's not so bad, because it 
means that that'll automatically require... or

05:12.910 --> 05:21.019
require us to work with scientists in less 
developed countries, or someone in less

05:12.910 --> 05:21.019
developed countries, to be able to work there. 
Maybe that'll force a kind of technology transfer

05:21.800 --> 05:29.348
that we keep arguing about in this country and 
finding ways of doing it. But it may not, in the long

05:29.368 --> 05:32.792
run, be so bad for the Earth as a whole. Somehow, 
we've got to distribute our knowledge and our

05:32.812 --> 05:39.179
expertise in oceanography to the rest of the 
world. The United States leads the world,

05:39.599 --> 05:41.922
probably, and like the rest of developed 
countries. But we've got to get this expertise out

05:46.612 --> 05:51.397
to the rest of the world, too. So there's a price 
we're probably going to pay for this lack of

05:51.417 --> 05:57.724
organized activity right now. But in the long run, 
I think it may be beneficial. A practical problem

06:03.511 --> 06:05.293
concerning present world, as a matter of fact, is 
energy from the ocean. Do you see, for example,

06:09.120 --> 06:14.986
thermal heat in your study offering any relief in 
terms of that? I think our basic research in

06:15.887 --> 06:22.034
geothermal work now is directed partly to these 
problems. How does hydrothermal circulation act

06:22.494 --> 06:26.458
in the oceans? I think in the near future it's going 
to be difficult to exploit that heat. There's a lot

06:31.463 --> 06:32.564
of heat coming up. It's going to be difficult to 
exploit it, partly because The heat coming out is

06:35.547 --> 06:37.470
at low temperatures. Start with a few degrees 
above the background temperature of the deep

06:37.811 --> 06:44.703
oceans, which is almost freezing. So it's very 
difficult to think of ways in which you could

06:44.723 --> 06:49.932
utilize such low temperature heat. And it's also 
diffuse. It comes out into the water and gets

06:51.816 --> 06:54.400
distributed right away. You could think about 
drilling holes down into the areas where it's hot

06:55.291 --> 07:02.961
and piping out hot water, like is being talked 
about on land. But it'll be that much more

07:03.001 --> 07:07.567
difficult in the oceans compared to the way it's 
being done on land. On the other hand, some of these

07:09.229 --> 07:16.179
major geothermal areas in the oceans extend right 
up onto the continents. One area I talked about

07:16.199 --> 07:20.564
before was the Gulf of California, where we found 
high heat flow. And that's an area which is energy

07:20.584 --> 07:23.408
deficient. which is near population centers, at 
least in Mexico, where we could perhaps be able to

07:24.316 --> 07:35.851
exploit the heat there, get it up on land and use it. 
But it's going to require advanced technology. I

07:38.094 --> 07:42.640
don't see this coming about in a realistic way for 
maybe 20 years at least. I don't think the

07:44.703 --> 07:47.927
geothermal that geothermal is going to be the 
solution to our energy problems. It may

07:53.420 --> 08:00.331
contribute to a small extent in 10 or 20 years, but 
it's not a major... I think the main contribution

08:00.351 --> 08:14.033
of our geothermal research at sea is 
understanding how the Earth works as a heat engine

08:00.351 --> 08:14.033
in general, and that the utilization of 
geothermal energy is mainly going to be on the

08:00.351 --> 08:14.033
continents. But we may gain a lot of clues about how 
these systems work on continents from the way we

08:14.992 --> 08:20.779
study them in the oceans. For example, it's a lot 
easier to make heat flow measurements on the ocean

08:21.920 --> 08:26.305
floor than it is on the continents. We can make a lot 
more of them at a cheaper price. And so we can

08:29.368 --> 08:40.341
understand hydrothermal systems in the oceans 
probably a lot more quickly than we can on the

08:29.368 --> 08:40.341
continents because of the difficulty of 
exploring on the continents. And I don't think,

08:40.658 --> 08:57.465
you know, when you think about the heat that exists 
under continental areas, the rate at which we use

08:40.658 --> 08:57.465
energy in the United States is so large that the 
geothermal energy just can't provide any large

08:40.658 --> 08:57.465
fraction of this heat in any way. I think solar 
energy is going to be much more important. And the

09:01.611 --> 09:08.522
development of utilizing solar heat stored in the 
oceans is going to be a more important aspect of

09:09.042 --> 09:17.655
getting energy out of the oceans than the 
geothermal part of it.

09:21.441 --> 09:30.255
Excuse me, my voice just went out all of a sudden.

09:32.318 --> 09:34.341
How do you feel the direction is going to go in 
combining earth studies and ocean studies and

09:34.591 --> 09:38.976
things like weather prediction? Do you feel as if 
the oceanographer of the future will be more

09:39.457 --> 09:46.926
broadly trained in terms of work with the land as 
well as the ocean? Yeah. Well, I think we'll still

09:49.048 --> 09:59.080
require the specialist in oceanography, but he's 
going to be part of a larger group, which probably

09:49.048 --> 09:59.080
is going to be more directed. in structure than it 
has been in the past, rather than people going out

09:59.549 --> 10:05.114
at random to study things that they're interested 
in. We're probably going to have more directed

10:06.715 --> 10:14.542
programs to understand these more applied 
aspects of oceanography, very important aspects

10:06.715 --> 10:14.542
of oceanography. How do the oceans supply heat to 
the atmosphere and create the weather patterns

10:14.562 --> 10:22.009
that we see over the continents? I think that's 
going to be a very important field in oceanography

10:22.029 --> 10:28.054
over the next 20, 30 years. probably involving 
more dollars and more people than the geological

10:29.047 --> 10:35.637
aspects of oceanography. Because the geology is 
not so urgent. Well, you can't say that, too,

10:38.942 --> 10:50.020
because there are certain minerals and things 
that may be acquired in the oceans, manganese

10:38.942 --> 10:50.020
nodules and things of this sort, over the next few 
years that may become quite important. I think we

10:50.040 --> 10:56.590
know quite a bit already about the distribution of 
those manganese nodules already from the

10:50.040 --> 10:56.590
expeditions that have gone on. But there'll be 
more detailed work going on on an applied basis.

11:01.265 --> 11:10.422
And as soon as these companies start mining this 
stuff, there'll be environmental aspects that

11:01.265 --> 11:10.422
we'll all have to worry about in the oceans.

11:10.983 --> 11:11.344
What else? That's all I have. Do you have anything 
you'd like to add to the tape? I don't think so

11:14.891 --> 11:18.477
unless I think of something right now. I don't 
write at the moment. Thank you.
