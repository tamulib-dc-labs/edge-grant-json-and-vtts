WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:03.544
I can't say that. Well, anyway, the drownouts were 
interesting, too, because people would sneak in

00:03.564 --> 00:14.437
the dorm, usually through the steam tunnels, come 
up into the dorm. And we'd get word of that

00:14.457 --> 00:17.181
sometimes, getting me to be drowned out. And so 
we'd have people watch in, but they'd get by. Go to

00:20.525 --> 00:26.272
the top floor and pull as many of those valves on 
cracker heads off of those commodes. And, of

00:26.592 --> 00:27.934
course, water just went everywhere. You get up on 
the top floor of this third and fourth floor of the

00:28.514 --> 00:32.299
dorm and pull those off. Before you know it, water 
would be cascading down those stairs. And I'll

00:38.506 --> 00:45.396
never forget as long as I live, one time they had so 
much water coming down the steps, probably 2.30, 3

00:38.506 --> 00:45.396
o'clock in the morning. I saw a New Testament 
cascading down the steps. It came almost to the

00:49.361 --> 00:51.064
foot of my door. When you're in a water fight, you 
try to get everything up off the floor. You try to

00:55.069 --> 00:58.094
get it up on the bunk or your desk or something 
because it would run. But that was kind of fun.

01:00.595 --> 01:05.522
Whose job was it then to clean up after the water 
fight? Well, of course we cleaned our own room, and

01:05.722 --> 01:09.407
I think we got out and cleaned the halls too. We 
didn't have janitors. We didn't have phones in the

01:11.350 --> 01:12.592
dorms. You know, we didn't have the amenities that 
you would have today in the dorm. Concrete floors.

01:17.458 --> 01:22.445
I mean, somebody might get a throw rug or an area rug 
in their room, but most of us didn't have anything

01:17.458 --> 01:22.445
like that. So that you knew pretty well. If we make 
the mess, we're going to clean it up. Oh, everybody

01:27.250 --> 01:28.131
had prunes. You'd start sweeping water and you'd 
just keep on, and of course there's debris, you

01:28.151 --> 01:35.059
know, waste paper and junk, like you say, stuff 
came down the steps or whatever. But it wasn't

01:35.760 --> 01:37.381
unusual to do that. Another thing that was common 
was you'd start dumping stuff in a big one. It was a

01:40.625 --> 01:47.753
great big butt can, big old ash, I mean, big old 
waste paper cans outside in the dorms. You'd start

01:47.773 --> 01:51.898
filling it with water and filling it with old milk 
and, scraps, and cigarette ashes, and probably

01:52.267 --> 01:55.171
against the door. The door's open to the inside. So 
if somebody you really were kind of chapped at or

01:56.834 --> 02:03.444
somebody, you know, everybody's picking all over 
you, lean that up against it. Of course, when you

02:03.464 --> 02:09.954
open the door, that big thing would fall over and 
just flood the room with just debris and junk and

02:03.464 --> 02:09.954
the most disgusting things. Now, was that also 
called a drowned out? No, and I don't know what that

02:12.257 --> 02:16.063
was called, but I remember it was done fairly 
often. Did y'all have any kind of, you or your

02:16.685 --> 02:25.000
friends have any kind of joke you played on 
somebody that was going to have a special big date?

02:29.829 --> 02:36.260
I have to admit to you, the non-regs did not have big 
special events like the boot dance and the

02:29.829 --> 02:36.260
military ball and the cotton ball. We didn't 
participate as much. A great regret in our life.

02:40.040 --> 02:44.144
But we didn't participate in that to that extent, 
so it was not common. About the most we would do

02:44.184 --> 02:50.330
would be to have a date night for football games or 
something like that. Parents weekend was, I

02:50.350 --> 02:53.273
think, Mother's Day, it was called. Mother's Day, 
maybe, or something like that. It was not Parents

02:56.255 --> 02:58.418
Day, I don't think. And that's the only day, as I 
recall, that mothers or women could come into the

02:58.438 --> 03:02.882
arms. Do you ever remember any good bull in a class, 
in a lab, in an academic area?

03:12.963 --> 03:19.813
probably took studies too seriously because of 
intimidation by probation or whatever,

03:12.963 --> 03:19.813
something like that, that I don't remember an 
awful lot that went on. Chemistry, there was

03:19.833 --> 03:22.297
always a goof off. You'd always mess up somebody's 
experiment or hand you something that was a little

03:22.317 --> 03:32.152
too warm or hot to handle or something like that, 
but I don't remember a lot. Let's slide to

03:32.592 --> 03:35.277
academics. Try to recall for us some of the very 
important, in terms of your life, important

03:41.228 --> 03:49.258
faculty members, advisors, counselors, who were 
they? What was special about them? Well, that's a

03:50.519 --> 03:51.881
great topic. Probably from a standpoint of 
significance. I told you that I went home every

03:57.027 --> 04:01.833
weekend to see this little head major head over 
there. When you didn't get out of class until then

04:01.853 --> 04:09.683
on Saturday, and you had to be back in class on 
Monday, and you lived 160 miles away, and you

04:01.853 --> 04:09.683
hitchhiked, that was not a real good arrangement. 
Mid-semester, my grades came out, and they showed

04:11.924 --> 04:17.510
that I went to Tyler every year. Dr. Potts. 
Wonderful man. Dr. R.C. Potts. Got to know him on a

04:24.476 --> 04:26.699
personal basis. In those days, you didn't have 
dorm phones. And when you had a note on your door,

04:31.123 --> 04:34.466
the color of the note determined what to do. You had 
a phone call with the YMCA at home. or there was a

04:37.591 --> 04:42.756
note behind your name, get a name card, you know, 
card holders, and they'd stick those notes in

04:37.591 --> 04:42.756
there. Certain colored notes, don't know which 
color, maybe yellow or something, meant you

04:42.776 --> 04:49.243
needed to go see somebody, faculty. Dr. Potts left 
one of those, and I had sent one, a runner over

04:49.263 --> 04:56.630
there, and left that, and I got that in, of course, 
had butterflies on the scene. I walked in there,

04:56.710 --> 05:03.497
and we got the most pleasant visit about common 
friends, mutual friends that we had in Tyler,

04:56.710 --> 05:03.497
great Aggies in Tyler. He leaned forward and 
looked me in the eye. He said, young man, if you

05:06.630 --> 05:13.820
intend to get your degree from this institution, I 
suggest you hook yourself into the traces. That is

05:14.501 --> 05:15.583
a direct quote. That almost makes me cry.

05:23.154 --> 05:27.139
He changed my life.

05:27.159 --> 05:27.780
I told him later. Now, in doing that, he was doing 
that in his role as the College of Agriculture.

05:35.170 --> 05:36.091
That's correct. The Wildlife Department was in 
the College of Agriculture. It scared me to death,

05:38.215 --> 05:41.720
embarrassed me horrendously. Think back. Had he 
not done that, I wouldn't have personal interest

05:43.663 --> 05:45.926
in that. And had the way that he did was settling me 
down to where I had some respect for him and not mad

05:46.848 --> 05:52.536
at him. then I don't know how to respond. I was a 
sensitive enough guy to word and serious enough

05:54.733 --> 06:00.142
about my studies until I got into goofing off. 
Until it embarrassed me. Now my roommate had a

06:01.504 --> 06:05.911
similar call, the guy that went to A&M with me from 
my same community. He said, oh, you won't fly

06:06.572 --> 06:08.455
because they won't do that. He finished with 
Stephen at Boston. He didn't make it. He didn't

06:14.024 --> 06:14.384
hold on. I got back and pouted for a day. Wrote the 
girl a letter and told her I would not be coming home

06:17.002 --> 06:25.538
much anymore and got serious about my studies and 
of course it turned everything around. I saw Dr.

06:25.558 --> 06:34.875
Potts years later on the field at TCU at a football 
game and he was working helping the athletic

06:25.558 --> 06:34.875
department I think after retirement. And I told my 
wife, I've got to go see him. And I went down there to

06:39.182 --> 06:41.784
the field and I told him what we'd done. I said, do 
you remember that? He said, son, I've had that

06:42.825 --> 06:44.767
experience many times. I don't. But I'm glad it 
worked out well for you. I was a veterinarian by

06:47.410 --> 06:50.353
that time. Because I went back to school six years 
after I'd been out. But that was the most

06:56.279 --> 06:58.382
significant thing that happened. But I remember 
those guys. Dr. Scruggs. Snuggs is his name. Over

07:03.647 --> 07:04.468
in chemistry. He was a World War I veteran. 
somebody, remember he was a flying ace or

07:07.441 --> 07:34.984
something, tough son of a gun, Dr. Pierce, Mr. 
Pierce, he wasn't a doctor, we called him Dr.

07:07.441 --> 07:34.984
Pierce, Mr. Pierce in the English department, he 
taught speaking for professional men, and he

07:07.441 --> 07:34.984
would call on you cold turkey, come to the front of 
the room, and call on you, tell us about so and so,

07:07.441 --> 07:34.984
and make you do impromptu speeches, 
demonstration speeches and so on, and I have to

07:07.441 --> 07:34.984
tell you that anybody who had his course, may be 
intimidated when they get up and talk, but the less

07:36.888 --> 07:42.157
intimidated wouldn't have been had they not had 
his course. Now, did y'all have nicknames for him?

07:44.481 --> 07:45.502
Oh, didn't have one. I don't know whether Pierce 
did or not. Snuggs was just Snuggs. Now, if he

07:49.148 --> 07:53.756
caught you doing something, if you're smoking, 
come in the classroom, he'd collect cigarettes.

07:53.776 --> 07:58.364
He had a huge collection of cigarettes, you know, 
because you'd give him one. But there were many

07:58.965 --> 08:00.167
nicknames. Ivy League, Taylor. Did you have class 
with him? I didn't have him. I had another guy for

08:03.719 --> 08:11.632
history, and I'm sitting here, and I can normally 
think of his name, and I can't remember his name.

08:11.652 --> 08:12.393
Delightful fellow. Taught a good course. Got an 
old blue book benton. Taught government. Tough

08:17.140 --> 08:18.943
professor. Essay questions. It was not rare to see 
20s and 30s on test scores. He scared me to death. He

08:24.632 --> 08:26.115
scared good grade into me. I studied that course as 
much as maybe any other undergraduate course I

08:27.457 --> 08:31.363
ever studied. Chemistry didn't scare me enough. I 
had a tough time, but chemistry didn't take it

08:33.313 --> 08:35.256
seriously. When I went back to go to med school, I 
had to take some chemistry. I was a good chemistry

08:37.820 --> 08:41.225
student, but there again it was a matter of 
application. Do you remember who the chemistry

08:42.507 --> 08:45.832
instructors were at your head? A guy named 
Smintowski taught me one time, but he taught me

08:46.152 --> 08:51.179
after I went back to school. A guy named, for some 
reason I'm really having trouble with names this

08:51.200 --> 08:55.666
morning, Isabel. Dr. Isabel taught over there. 
He's the one that did that, invented that

08:59.710 --> 09:05.417
imitation skunk. I wouldn't be surprised. For 
deer hunting. Really? Yeah. He was a hunter. I

09:11.125 --> 09:11.986
remember he was a hunter. What you do to get so the 
deer doesn't smell you, he smells his imitation

09:12.206 --> 09:20.557
skunk smell that won't stick with you when you go 
home. And you take a little of that and rub it on

09:21.058 --> 09:24.262
where you're going to be. Yeah. Any other 
nicknames you remember? Well...

09:30.828 --> 09:35.896
The nickname, we had some special names for Gunny 
Putnam that taught economics. Hard-nosed, got to

09:36.858 --> 09:41.004
embarrass you, move you to the front of the class 
and embarrass you. Every Monday you'd get a new

09:41.024 --> 09:42.827
one, got to pick on him. Don't remember his 
official nickname. There were some, C.S. Harris,

09:47.935 --> 09:53.765
Ivy League Taylor, Dr. Dan the Great Point Man. I 
didn't have him. I think I should have, but... I

09:58.452 --> 10:02.596
know some people who said that without him, they 
would never have their ring or degrees. Dan

10:02.676 --> 10:03.597
Russell. But in terms of... The wildlife 
department, of course, I remember those

10:07.420 --> 10:09.703
professors well. They didn't have nicknames for 
them. Who were some of them? Dr. Baldoff taught

10:12.445 --> 10:16.829
fisheries and herpetology. Dr. Davis, W.B. 
Davis, was a pretty renowned mammologist, and he

10:19.092 --> 10:24.316
was the head of the department. Dr. Jack Inglis. 
was there. Dr. Dixon was there, but I didn't know

10:26.903 --> 10:29.168
him. He was teaching. I think he must have come 
after I took those basic courses. Describe

10:32.194 --> 10:35.482
Baldolph and Inglis. Tough-minded professors. 
Dr. Davis didn't laugh a lot. Talked about antics

10:40.493 --> 10:41.976
in the classroom. Studied for labs. That wildlife 
curriculum was very challenging, correctly.

10:45.719 --> 10:52.469
very scientific taxonomic studies and memory had 
to be pretty extensive. You really had to work on it

10:52.509 --> 10:55.633
because it was just raw, rank memory. Just 
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of scientific

10:56.254 --> 11:00.180
names and stuff. Dr. Davis was a dictatorial type 
head of the department. And he didn't mix with the

11:04.847 --> 11:06.890
students all that much. But everybody scared the 
death out of him. And one time we were studying for a

11:10.174 --> 11:12.638
mammology And we had these dried skins. And he had 
maybe the world's best bat collection, certainly

11:16.854 --> 11:22.741
the one in the southwest. But there were skins 
where the bats had extended wings. And a guy named

11:26.045 --> 11:32.213
Friedersdorf decided he was going to sail one of 
those like a plane over to another student. And

11:32.233 --> 11:36.718
about the time that he sailed that bat, Dr. Davis 
walked around the corner. In typical A&M fashion

11:38.437 --> 11:42.822
in those days, we all paid a big price for this. We 
had a practical on the spot. Dr. Baldoff, a fellow

11:45.685 --> 11:59.541
that at the time you were kind of afraid of, because 
he was really, by the book, a tough professional,

11:45.685 --> 11:59.541
very demanding, good sense of humor, really good 
sense of humor. As I began to finish up my studies

12:00.642 --> 12:04.006
and look back on him, I thought a world of him. He 
forced you into... He forced you into being a

12:08.356 --> 12:11.942
pretty good student because he challenged it. He 
would give those, in those days, he'd give those

12:11.962 --> 12:14.365
200-point tests. Lab practicals were just 
absolutely dismal because you'd have them at

12:14.606 --> 12:20.034
night sometime and they went on forever. And those 
were extremely challenging. All right, when you

12:23.460 --> 12:35.038
got your degree and you're going out into the real 
world, how well prepared did you feel you were for

12:23.460 --> 12:35.038
that real world based on your A&M training? 
Technically speaking, I felt very, very

12:35.778 --> 12:40.326
equipped. But right after, when I went on active 
duty, I went to Fort Knox, Kentucky, at very light

12:40.406 --> 12:56.993
duty, worked in a separation transfer point, and I 
was a clerk, had a Class 8 pass, we came in with no

12:40.406 --> 12:56.993
formations and that sort of thing. That 
environment set up a very casual social

12:57.985 --> 13:03.891
atmosphere for those that worked in that 
particular transfer center. I met a man who went to

13:03.911 --> 13:14.762
Wayne in Michigan, a fellow who went to New York 
University, and so on. My liberal arts

13:14.782 --> 13:25.073
experience, my experience with politics, my 
experience with the world around us, Frankly, it

13:25.475 --> 13:28.322
was extremely lucky. I couldn't carry on a decent 
conversation with those fellows about current

13:28.342 --> 13:38.426
events, about the world scene politically or the 
local situation. Social aspects, socially I was

13:38.446 --> 13:41.172
dwarfed. quite frankly. You know, I didn't have 
anything but maybe a couple pairs of pants, you

13:42.910 --> 13:47.216
know, two shirts or something up there. These 
fellas came from people with better financial

13:47.657 --> 13:50.861
backgrounds than I did too. But at the same time, I 
have to tell you that I thought, I realized then I

13:51.602 --> 13:57.331
had a lot to learn. I was determined to do that too, 
by the way. I spent a lot of time with those guys.

14:04.160 --> 14:09.488
Let's see, did you feel as a transfer student, did 
you ever feel like you were looked down upon or

14:09.957 --> 14:15.403
second class or anything like that? At the time, 
non-regs was not a very complimentary term

14:15.663 --> 14:20.168
because most were in the Corps. And the one that 
wanted to be in the Corps, you wouldn't transfer in

14:20.949 --> 14:24.993
the Corps when you're a junior. I'm not sure you 
even could. But it was impractical to do that, even

14:27.897 --> 14:30.119
if you could. But anyway, yeah, I have to tell you 
that I did feel that way. And right now, when

14:33.803 --> 14:36.606
somebody asks what I feel that you have, It's a 
question I almost dread because there's an

14:36.822 --> 14:41.207
explanation who was with it, you know. Now, I'm 
here to tell you the transfer students, I don't

14:41.228 --> 14:50.599
think I'm a living example, can be as dedicated an 
Aggie as anybody ever lived, more than many who

14:41.228 --> 14:50.599
were in the Corps. I was going to say. But with the 
same token, if you say, do you wish it would have

14:51.540 --> 14:55.385
been differently? Absolutely. Because I've had a 
rich life because of A&M. I would have had a richer

14:59.450 --> 15:03.235
life had I been in the Corps, and I fully recognize 
that. This is not really part of this, but how many

15:03.518 --> 15:10.847
association presidents have not been corps 
members? Not many. I don't know. I'm not sure. Has

15:13.350 --> 15:15.353
there ever been a transfer student to the corps? 
That's what I'm thinking. But I have to say that in

15:17.796 --> 15:22.963
my stock answer, if somebody gave me the trouble 
and said, well, what about a transfer? That was not

15:22.983 --> 15:24.304
exactly the same. He was a transfer student. And I 
would stand on it. Also, once or twice, Mr. Rudder,

15:29.135 --> 15:37.804
to me, let me know that he had a little bit of a thin 
spot of having frogged in. That one he didn't like.

15:41.228 --> 15:43.831
He didn't like anybody to gig him on that. I tried my 
very best to transfer him after my freshman year at

15:43.991 --> 15:47.635
Tyler Junior College. My buddy and I were on the 
transfer very badly. It just wasn't going to work

15:51.078 --> 15:53.421
at home. And I worked all the time. I was in junior 
college. But like I say, we needed this. We needed

15:57.571 --> 15:58.912
the financial support. Our whole family did. Part 
of my check went to make a car payment. And that's

16:02.617 --> 16:04.739
just the way it was in those days. And I missed a lot. 
And I realize it. I would not say that I'm

16:07.443 --> 16:09.365
thin-skinned about it. Well, I guess I would be 
thin-skinned about it. But it's not by somebody

16:11.668 --> 16:13.089
else. It's self-imposed. Do you remember what, in 
round numbers, what it cost for you to go to A&M?

16:20.338 --> 16:21.079
Yes, sir. It cost me somewhere between $800 and 
$1,000 a year. And that's room, board, tuition?

16:28.512 --> 16:29.993
That's the whole ballpark. Of course, you didn't 
have cards. I spent a nickel one week out of pocket.

16:35.318 --> 16:38.041
I was going to hitchhike home, and I had a nickel on 
Monday. Now, I'm not saying I didn't have anything

16:39.282 --> 16:42.145
but a nickel, but it was a principle. I'm going to 
spend a nickel this week. And I bought a Coke on the

16:44.247 --> 16:47.890
way out of the dorm to go hitchhike with Tom. All 
right. I've had some people describe hitchhiking

16:48.571 --> 16:51.133
in the 30s. Tell me about hitchhiking in the 50s. 
Where did you go to catch the ride? Well, you try to

16:55.322 --> 16:56.984
get it out on 21. You get some kind of ride. Usually 
it was some Aggie leaving town. Now, many times you

17:00.810 --> 17:05.117
could post something over an academic door that 
you needed to ride to the tower. Sometimes it

17:05.999 --> 17:07.040
didn't work out. Everybody didn't have a car. Far, 
far fewer people had cars. And a few of the guys that

17:11.948 --> 17:14.112
had cars were screwy as a loon. They'd drive 95 
miles an hour down those old roads up through the

17:14.132 --> 17:19.180
North Suge and, you know, all through Baird and 
Skirman half the day. So you'd hitchhike at a

17:19.835 --> 17:22.138
matter of convenience. Once you got out there with 
that suitcase, that big TAM on it, it wasn't a TAM,

17:22.158 --> 17:35.432
it's a big T, Texas Aggies on it, or that little 
maroon bag that everybody had, little cloth

17:22.158 --> 17:35.432
maroon bag, Texas Aggies on there. When you got out 
there, if you'd stay on the beaten paths,

17:35.452 --> 17:39.717
hitchhiking was not a problem. You would get 
picked up. Now, you didn't want to go off like I did

17:40.778 --> 17:47.766
one time to Hearn, over to Marquis, to Graveland, 
to, you know, that'd take you, you'd grow old doing

17:40.778 --> 17:47.766
that. And I've had rides with drunks and, you know, 
women and, you know, everything else. It was an

17:54.256 --> 17:59.044
experience that I wouldn't want to trade it, but I 
could see where people would particularly want to

17:54.256 --> 17:59.044
do it. You couldn't do it today. Normally, it took 
you how long to get from college? Not much longer.

18:03.872 --> 18:08.961
If you caught a ride, you could usually be home in 
about three hours if you caught a ride. you know,

18:09.481 --> 18:10.764
within three hours. You'd be there in three to four 
hours. Now sometimes five, but I mean usually it

18:12.788 --> 18:16.676
did not take you that much longer. You could stay on 
the beaten path, and I'm talking about my way would

18:16.756 --> 18:29.121
be go up to Normandy, cut across over there, and get 
up on 69, you know, and head up toward Palestine,

18:16.756 --> 18:29.121
Palestine to Tyler. There was not much to it. It's 
coming back, by the way. You know, the Aggie line

18:34.245 --> 18:35.746
was out. Every town had a place called the Aggie 
line. And that's where Aggies would be trying to

18:38.309 --> 18:40.471
get back to school. I mean, I was sitting in laps, 
you know, laying down across people and

18:40.812 --> 18:47.238
everything else, setting floorboards. If there 
was room for a person in the car, you would not be

18:47.979 --> 18:52.103
left there at the Aggie line. And in that routine, 
class... year, civilian or corps, did not matter.

19:02.698 --> 19:03.178
Is that right? In hitchhiking? No. Now Buck 
Henderson tells me that he used to catch a ride with

19:05.761 --> 19:12.049
Rod Stepp and some of those guys back up there and 
they never even dropped pounds with him. He used to

19:12.149 --> 19:12.950
ride back and forth. They never dropped pounds 
with him until the very end of his freshman year.

19:16.814 --> 19:18.096
And he never could figure that one out. They were 
harassing him. But no, that's right. That was

19:20.339 --> 19:21.620
insignificant. You were Aggie buddies and that 
was not a problem. Did you have a job while you were

19:25.625 --> 19:27.447
at ANA? I did not work regularly. I helped some over 
at the wildlife department. I talked to Mr. Rhodes

19:32.269 --> 19:35.915
who was over at the forestry about working there. 
We helped him some, but not much of a job regularly.

19:39.299 --> 19:42.384
I was normally had a schedule with labs to where it 
didn't allow much. In the summer, where did you

19:43.125 --> 19:44.727
work? Well, in the summer what you tried to do, this 
is an interesting thing, you talked about $800 to

19:44.907 --> 19:50.555
$1,000 a year to go to school. Of course, I couldn't 
make $800 to $1,000 in the summer. So I'd work and

19:53.532 --> 19:58.497
make up all the debt, pay back the bank as much as I 
could, and then they'd start borrowing again. So

19:58.517 --> 20:03.921
by the time I got to my senior year, I borrowed most 
of my last year down there, my third year. In the

20:04.922 --> 20:12.269
summers, I was fortunate because Tyler State Park 
was where I had grown up, and I had, by that time, had

20:04.922 --> 20:12.269
a pretty good handle on that. And I'd go back, and I 
knew how to work all those stations, the

20:12.289 --> 20:18.074
boathouse, concession area, the bathhouse, the 
lake and swimming areas. I'd go back and help my dad

20:18.635 --> 20:22.138
and work there. And in that particular case, 
nepotism served people that well because you knew

20:22.287 --> 20:26.692
the job well. And you would work tremendous hours, 
get up very early, make the garbage runs, the

20:26.753 --> 20:34.642
picnic areas, and work until closing time at 1 
o'clock, clean the buildings and so on. Go home and

20:34.662 --> 20:38.647
do the laundry and the bathing suits sometime at 1 
o'clock in the morning. One summer, I worked with

20:38.667 --> 20:44.054
the quail hatchery in Tyler. Being a classmate in 
wildlife, they wanted you to have a summer job with

20:44.074 --> 20:48.740
the quail hatchery. So when you finished, you owed 
about how much? Probably over $800. The reason I

20:54.261 --> 20:57.124
ask that, I'm comparing that to the sums of today. 
Right. And of course, today some of them have

20:57.645 --> 21:00.488
staggering amounts. Well, I only make $340 a month 
when I cut it out. Sure. Now, I'm not suggesting

21:04.312 --> 21:06.234
that it's equitable. So you owed between two and 
three months income. That's right. Let's see. Go

21:13.663 --> 21:14.644
back to the classroom. What were the expected 
rules? of class attendance, behavior, attitude,

21:18.785 --> 21:23.391
dress, etc. Well, attendance was stressed to the 
extent that if you were graduating senior, if you

21:24.152 --> 21:35.767
cut classes, we of course had so many I think, if you 
cut classes, you did not graduate. Not you may not

21:35.787 --> 21:39.091
graduate, you did not graduate. That was 
stressed. You didn't take finals if you had a C

21:40.213 --> 21:47.622
average or better, I think it was, in your senior 
year, but you had to go to class and they were very

21:40.213 --> 21:47.622
emphatic. I know friends I know people who never 
finished A&M because they end that far along in

21:48.535 --> 21:58.885
their studies they did not finish because they 
were kicked out twice in a so-called last

21:48.535 --> 21:58.885
semester.

21:58.905 --> 22:01.307
The dress was, of course, military or non-reg. I 
typically wore jeans and probably some plaid

22:01.327 --> 22:11.537
shirt, you know, Margal socks, plaid shirt, 
jeans, and probably some kind of a fetal boot, you

22:01.327 --> 22:11.537
know, some kind. Didn't wear tennis shoes, didn't 
wear shorts. Umbrellas were not done at A&M. You

22:16.970 --> 22:19.013
wouldn't dare carry an umbrella across the area. 
You should. Yes. Everybody should. And I remember

22:22.958 --> 22:29.486
graduate students maybe didn't or something, but 
you spoke to everybody, non-reg or whatever. Now,

22:29.506 --> 22:33.211
every once in a while you'd find some guy that 
didn't speak, and you know, they were outcast to

22:29.506 --> 22:33.211
the hilt. But you spoke to everybody. If you saw 
somebody in there, just like you were in the court,

22:34.733 --> 22:39.439
you went back and you shook hands with who they were 
with on the side wall. It was not an exception.

22:41.061 --> 22:43.804
There were very, very few exceptions in our 
school. What about student diversity? Tell me

22:46.180 --> 22:53.758
about any acquaintances you recall who were not 
mainline Anglo-Saxon. For example, were there

22:54.479 --> 22:56.985
some Jewish students that you remember? I'm sure 
there were. Tyler and it was white and black over

23:00.052 --> 23:06.303
there and there was some Jewish guys never even 
thought about it you know. Were there any any

23:06.383 --> 23:09.408
Hispanic students? Yeah there were some Hispanic 
students there not they didn't stick out they were

23:09.609 --> 23:19.406
just students that were there there wasn't no 
issue was made of that you see what I'm saying?

23:19.446 --> 23:21.790
Right across the hall was a guy from Raymondville a 
Caucasian guy, a white male student, white

23:22.158 --> 23:29.789
student, and a guy from Raymondville, Hispanic 
descent. I didn't think any more or less of one than

23:30.270 --> 23:32.433
I did the other. Just no issue was made. Now, the 
nearest thing you would come to finding someone

23:33.935 --> 23:39.864
would be maybe a student from Pakistan, Panama. 
But you know, we were personable. We knew those

23:43.028 --> 23:43.929
guys. And nothing was made of that issue in those 
days that I know of. That would be my answer, too. It

23:54.082 --> 23:58.910
was not an issue that we bothered to give any 
thought to. If you said, where's that guy from

23:59.712 --> 24:01.475
Panama? Now, faculty members had nicknames. Did 
students in that era have nicknames? A lot did, in

24:08.928 --> 24:11.453
the core they all did, just about. But a lot of guys, 
I guess, had nicknames. But in those days, no

24:14.732 --> 24:18.096
matter whether you're A&M or not, a lot of people 
had nicknames. My best friend was Heavy, and my

24:18.116 --> 24:22.281
other best friend was, my two best friends were 
Pinky. They called me Ace. You know, my middle

24:24.684 --> 24:28.148
initial's A for Allen, and they called me Ace. And 
still do. I get letters A's across there or

24:29.709 --> 24:33.494
something. But it was not unusual. People had 
nicknames a lot in those days. YMCA. Uh-huh. What

24:39.547 --> 24:42.390
happened at the Y in those days? Well, my 
experience at the Y was where you went to, you were

24:43.471 --> 24:49.819
summoned to go to the farm. And my granddad passed 
away when I was a senior then. And he had several

24:53.943 --> 24:57.527
crises when I was a senior. And I hitchhiked home, 
left as early as 4 o'clock in the morning before

24:57.547 --> 25:02.653
leaving, trying to get my time. And he'd respond, 
he'd come back and do fine for a while. but you'd

25:06.547 --> 25:11.456
have a knock on the door and they'd bring you a 
telephone message from the YMCA. Yale practices

25:12.438 --> 25:15.403
were held on steps of the YMCA. After the ball game, 
the Yale leaders would go to the YMCA.

25:23.478 --> 25:27.645
The financial aid office was over there, if I 
remember down in the basement. Housing I think was

25:27.665 --> 25:30.310
over in the basement of the YMCA building. All 
right. Meetings. We had hometown club meetings

25:32.521 --> 25:36.505
many times there or anything in that city. What did 
a hometown club do? That was really the social

25:38.608 --> 25:42.912
organization outside the Corps of Cadets. And I'm 
not saying the Corps was excluded from that, but

25:44.273 --> 25:48.017
non-regs corps everybody. Hometowns were a big 
thing. Tyler Smith County A&M Club. Hometown club

25:53.663 --> 25:55.585
was a big thing. We gathered, and I don't remember, 
I doubt if it was monthly, but it was quarterly.

25:59.652 --> 26:01.134
Mother's clubs would send cookies. I was an 
officer in that club. They'd send cookies, and I'd

26:02.697 --> 26:05.382
get the cookies, and I'd go to the post office and 
get them. Post office was a big thing in those days.

26:06.684 --> 26:08.928
Everybody would go to the post office. Went over 
and had a box of cookies, and I had trouble keeping

26:08.948 --> 26:15.599
them up somewhere where the ants didn't get in them 
until we had our meeting. And probably did what?

26:17.242 --> 26:24.073
Probably MSC or somebody had an urn of coffee or 
something up there, and I'd take the cookies over

26:17.242 --> 26:24.073
at our meetings. The greatest party that was given 
in Tyler, Texas in those days was A&M Hometown Club

26:25.488 --> 26:41.444
party at Christmas break and students, mainly 
A&M, the girls in Tyler wanted to go to that so we had

26:25.488 --> 26:41.444
no trouble getting dates. We had a disc jockey out 
there, clean fun, people drank, brought their

26:41.684 --> 26:47.450
bottles or something, like Dry Counties. 
Sponsored by the A&M Club? And the Mothers Club

26:50.834 --> 26:52.156
helping? Mothers Club and the local A&M Club, 
Tyler Smith County, and the students would go.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.984
Many students from other universities would come 
to that party. A great, great party, you know, up

26:59.605 --> 27:02.388
there. Clean-cut thing, but we had a lot of fun. And 
whatever happened to it, I don't know. MSC.

27:10.238 --> 27:10.759
Describe. Well, it's got the nickname of the 
living room on the campus. I don't know whether

27:13.783 --> 27:15.385
they still call that or not. In those days, it was 
just that. Dorms were small, but they were pretty

27:17.885 --> 27:20.796
smart. When you want to meet somebody, or if you're 
ever going to do something where you needed a cup of

27:20.816 --> 27:27.642
coffee or something like that, you go to the MSC. 
The Bowling Alley was down there. I wasn't a

27:29.309 --> 27:33.414
bowler, but when you rarely had a date on the 
campus, they'd always want to go down to Bowling

27:29.309 --> 27:33.414
Alley. That's where everybody gathered and you'd 
see your friends down there. If they weren't so

27:35.898 --> 27:39.302
good looking, you'd try not to go to Bowling Alley. 
But you'd go to the MSC and down there, the

27:39.322 --> 27:45.811
Association of Former Students was down there and 
down the hall. I guess it would be the West End down

27:45.831 --> 27:49.115
there, downstairs. They had a small library over 
there. A lot of their hometown newspapers would be

27:51.979 --> 27:55.244
there and publications. Periodicals were there. 
Read those. Along the main walk right now where the

27:58.267 --> 28:04.160
chairs and sitting areas with the windows, they 
were there in those days. A lot of foreign students

28:04.842 --> 28:09.432
spent time at the NSC. I say we didn't delineate 
that, but I do remember that it was not unusual for a

28:09.613 --> 28:15.145
lot of the foreign students to spend time over 
there. Also, that's where you can make your phone

28:15.698 --> 28:17.541
calls. If you want to call home, you go downstairs, 
down that hallway, kind of like you're going to the

28:17.561 --> 28:24.773
MSC, I'm sorry, the Associated Department of 
Students Office. On the left-hand side there was a

28:25.214 --> 28:29.220
bank of phones. And if you want to make a phone call, 
you'd go back, get in line, and call home or

28:29.240 --> 28:37.294
something. Guyon Hall. What happened in and 
around Guyon Hall? Well, it's the end of the walk

28:42.867 --> 28:47.938
down there, and Guyon Hall was the most 
interesting place I guess there was. The cadets

28:47.958 --> 28:52.649
would go there and watch, you know, there'd be 
productions over there of some kind. The big

28:52.669 --> 28:56.978
productions were at G. Raleigh, Blacktown Hall. I 
didn't go there a lot, but you know how the students

28:58.443 --> 29:07.032
were always wisecracking and talking back and 
comments and responding. Going to a movie at

29:07.052 --> 29:10.075
Aggieland those days was an experience to behold. 
You may not hear much dialogue at the movie. You

29:11.717 --> 29:14.339
heard a lot of conversation outside the audience. 
Really a fun time. Funny, some of the original

29:15.721 --> 29:17.883
comments you heard. Were there movies almost 
every night at Guyon? I don't remember. I'm not

29:22.968 --> 29:24.750
sure there were movies every night at Guyon. Maybe 
on the weekends. I do go to Guy a lot. I've been

29:27.905 --> 29:29.587
there, been there a number of times. I don't 
remember going a lot to Guy. The town halls are much

29:31.709 --> 29:37.376
more memorable to me because they had big name 
entertainment in there. Swan Lake, saw Swan Lake

29:37.396 --> 29:39.599
there. Brenda Lee was there. Gosh, the Lettermen, 
you know, they were a popular singing group in

29:43.563 --> 29:46.306
those days. They came. And it was almost like you'd 
have a feeling that the, you know, when you went in

29:47.768 --> 29:54.336
the military, they had these USOs, these shows 
sometimes. It was a great time being there, but

29:54.890 --> 29:58.655
there was some melancholy when it was over. When 
the town halls were over, it was a little bit

29:59.395 --> 30:07.966
melancholic, and you'd been to a great thing, but 
it was such an uplifting experience that when it

29:59.395 --> 30:07.966
was over, it became fairly mundane. And I'll tell 
you what, that was a love-hate relationship if I

30:08.767 --> 30:12.311
ever saw it. You'd leave that campus, and you could 
not wait to leave that campus. You'd drive back in

30:16.176 --> 30:22.804
there on Sunday nights, especially when it was 
winter, and you'd see those old smokestacks over

30:16.176 --> 30:22.804
there and that steam coming out. it looked like a 
penitentiary. That big water tower. It felt like a

30:27.066 --> 30:28.327
penitentiary. But there's something about that 
that bonded us that I don't know anybody has really

30:29.148 --> 30:36.795
ever explained to me where I fully understand that 
emotion. But it's an emotional thing to talk

30:36.815 --> 30:38.457
about. There's a spirit that can never be told. I'm 
telling you. And really, you have a tough time

30:41.060 --> 30:43.782
talking about that. Religious

30:43.842 --> 30:48.307
emphasis week. Do you remember that? No. I went to 
church regularly. I went to First Baptist Church

30:52.749 --> 30:55.072
over at Northgate. And I went over there on Sunday 
mornings. I didn't go Wednesdays and Sunday

30:57.215 --> 31:02.542
nights, but I went on Sunday mornings. And 
typically get up and go to church. It was unusual

31:05.246 --> 31:06.348
for guys. The Catholic boys were always 
excellent. They did get up and go to Mass. And I

31:10.493 --> 31:11.575
always admired that. Many of us do go to church 
regularly. Where were most of the churches? I

31:20.307 --> 31:20.888
don't know.
