WEBVTT

00:07.253 --> 00:13.483
Okay, Dr. Bain, in the fall, you will have a 
slightly different position at A&M. Would you

00:13.523 --> 00:14.865
explain this, please? Yes. For the last four 
years, I've had a joint appointment of director of

00:16.507 --> 00:31.050
the Center for Energy and Mental Resources, which 
was created by the Board of Regents to help provide

00:31.570 --> 00:37.636
coordinate and develop energy-related programs 
in teaching, research, and in public service.

00:38.437 --> 00:39.158
That was in 1975. In 1977, Dr.

00:39.178 --> 00:54.173
Dick Winerdi left the university for the private 
sector, and I took over as acting director and then

00:39.178 --> 00:54.173
director. I've been director for the last four 
years. In the fall, I will be full-time director of

00:56.935 --> 01:01.560
the center, and I will not have my formal 
association with the Engineering Experiment

01:02.047 --> 01:07.797
Station as its assistant director. I'd rather 
have a tie with the Engineering Experiment

01:08.939 --> 01:16.933
Station, but this was not my choosing. But that's 
just the way the ball bounces. The Energy and

01:22.062 --> 01:26.991
Mental Resources Program is, of course, very much 
engineering-oriented. About $250,000 of our

01:27.578 --> 01:34.829
about-million-dollar program is in 
engineering, as a matter of fact. We feel like

01:35.791 --> 01:42.881
we've helped develop engineer researchers, ag 
researchers, history researchers. One of our

01:43.803 --> 01:54.379
projects in the energy side of the house is the 
collection of the German documents that were the

01:43.803 --> 01:54.379
records of the German synthetic fuels programs. 
During World War II, Germany, not having an

01:55.253 --> 02:06.568
internal source of petroleum from natural 
petroleum, had to rely on synthetic fuels. And

02:07.509 --> 02:17.222
they were producing about 3 million barrels of 
petroleum for lubricants and for jet fuels and

02:07.509 --> 02:17.222
that sort of thing. That was their annual rate at 
that time. No, monthly rate, I'm sorry. monthly

02:21.882 --> 02:22.623
rate. In this country today we use about twice that 
amount per day for transportation alone and we

02:22.863 --> 02:43.045
have a very serious problem because we are very 
dependent upon foreign producers of oil and we saw

02:22.863 --> 02:43.045
what the OPEC embargo could do to this country in 
1973. So the German documents program is one that

02:43.125 --> 02:50.893
has a lot of involvement with the history 
department. It has some involvement with the

02:51.633 --> 02:57.728
technical side of the house and chemical 
engineers advise us and that sort of thing. We feel

02:58.197 --> 03:04.627
that Texas A&M has a very valuable resource here 
for the rest of the country. These documents

03:04.667 --> 03:26.500
contain records of problems that were 
experienced in the production of synthetic

03:04.667 --> 03:26.500
fuels, such as stress corrosion, hydrogen 
embrittlement, catalyst poisoning, and that

03:04.667 --> 03:26.500
sort of thing, that these records and their 
actions taken to correct their problems would be

03:04.667 --> 03:26.500
valuable to through the new synthetic fuels 
industry of this country once we get going. You

03:31.867 --> 03:39.775
think this synthetic fuels program is going to be, 
first thing is the finding of certain, or what is

03:31.867 --> 03:39.775
the status of it? Well, the windfall profits tax 
had about $240 billion income

03:39.795 --> 03:51.407
expected over the 10-year program. And of that, 
$80 billion was assigned to development of the

03:52.096 --> 03:59.523
synthetic fuels program in this country. And $17 
billion of that are now in the hands of the

03:59.543 --> 04:09.912
Synthetic Fuels Corporation, which is a 
government entity established by Congress last

03:59.543 --> 04:09.912
year. And they are currently, I guess you would 
say, in the state of getting organized and having

04:11.033 --> 04:21.343
projects transferred to them from the Department 
of Energy. current administration of this

04:21.593 --> 04:49.137
country is now phasing down the governmental 
involvement in solar and conservation and that

04:21.593 --> 04:49.137
sort of thing and feeling that the prices of energy 
are affecting these developments and that

04:21.593 --> 04:49.137
there's no need for the infusion of large dollars 
into conservation and into solar energy that if

04:21.593 --> 04:49.137
the economics are right that people will conserve 
and they will develop solar energy. What

04:55.602 --> 04:59.727
statistics do we have on whether people are 
conserving or not? They are conserving. You can

05:02.010 --> 05:06.996
see that in the use of gasoline in this country. 
It's been reduced about 20%, actually. Now, this

05:12.182 --> 05:14.165
is from conservation. It's also from use of more 
efficient cars. more fuel efficient. The

05:20.484 --> 05:30.916
manufacturers have finally gotten the word, and 
Ford and General Motors are now producing

05:20.484 --> 05:30.916
lightweight cars, and in a couple of years you 
won't be able to buy a large car. This is sort of

05:32.057 --> 05:45.212
forced conservation, but we need to force the 
conservation because, as I said, we're using

05:32.057 --> 05:45.212
close to six million barrels of liquid petroleum 
per day. to run the transportation of this country

05:45.648 --> 05:48.812
alone. We import about 7 billion barrels a day. And 
that, at the prices that OPEX are charging or the

05:55.302 --> 06:05.957
world is charging, is like exporting major 
corporations, the wealth of our country. It's a

06:06.017 --> 06:08.380
very serious problem. So I'm delighted to be the 
director of the Center for Energy and Resources

06:08.400 --> 06:15.570
and help try to develop the resources of this state 
lignite, biomass, conservation. And so in that

06:20.600 --> 06:32.401
light, I'm delighted to be the full-time 
director, but I would rather stay as an assistant

06:20.600 --> 06:32.401
director part-time and help develop programs 
like I have in the past. One of the recent programs I

06:34.004 --> 06:38.352
helped develop was a workshop that is 
administered by the Engineering Experiment

06:38.872 --> 06:41.875
Station. And it's a half million dollar summer 
program being operated right now for the Gas

06:42.976 --> 06:50.965
Research Institute out of Chicago. We have 26 
scientists. They are physicists and chemists and

06:55.269 --> 07:06.381
engineers who are assessing the potential for 
developing gas supplies for this country. from

07:06.985 --> 07:14.612
inorganic resources such as carbonates, such as 
water, such as carbon dioxide. How can we develop a

07:14.632 --> 07:20.918
burnable replacement for natural gas from those 
resources? And this is a program that I helped

07:21.799 --> 07:26.743
develop starting in January of this year. It is in 
full force right now. We're required to produce a

07:30.747 --> 07:35.912
final report by the 14th of August and We have 
structured a program that involves a technical

07:36.382 --> 07:43.830
implementation committee and a workshop 
advisory panel. And I think we've done a good job. I

07:46.092 --> 07:47.754
hope that others feel the same way. Other programs 
that I've helped develop here in engineering are,

07:48.875 --> 08:04.212
as a program developer, you have to keep your ear to 
the ground and locate the problems locate the

08:04.664 --> 08:13.901
interest of what part of the federal government or 
what part of the industry is interested in helping

08:04.664 --> 08:13.901
to solve problems. And I became aware of a program. 
The awareness came about through my association

08:17.908 --> 08:28.748
with the American Society for Engineering 
Education and association with some

08:17.908 --> 08:28.748
representatives of the Department of Defense. 
About four years ago, there was a program of

08:29.538 --> 08:40.872
Department of Defense that was proposed to 
Congress to help solve the equipment problems of

08:29.538 --> 08:40.872
universities. Equipment is a very expensive part 
of a university, and maintaining modern,

08:40.912 --> 08:53.908
current, advanced capabilities is a very 
difficult thing. So they had what they called a

08:54.631 --> 09:02.140
Defense Science and Engineering Equipment 
Program, DCEP it was called. And from that, the Air

09:02.160 --> 09:14.454
Force set aside some monies to develop a program 
with industry's participation in composites.

09:14.474 --> 09:20.942
And as a result of that, finding out the interest of 
the Air Force, And having capable, competent

09:21.580 --> 09:33.032
researchers here at A&M, we were able to put the two 
together and develop a graduate program in

09:21.580 --> 09:33.032
composites.

09:33.552 --> 09:36.996
That's carbon and boron fibers and that sort of 
thing. Composites are, of course, lightweight

09:37.216 --> 09:40.920
replacements for metals. And the Air Force's 
interest, of course, was for use in aircraft, but

09:41.060 --> 09:50.710
automobiles can be made lighter and hence more 
fuel efficient. There are many applications for

09:51.078 --> 09:52.881
this. Another program that I was involved in 
helping develop was a program to evaluate the

09:53.722 --> 10:10.988
behavior of oil on water in the presence of waves 
and in the presence of currents and in the presence

09:53.722 --> 10:10.988
of waves and currents. That was about a million 
dollar program. And from that evolved a

10:14.854 --> 10:20.022
development of an oil spill course on how do you 
collect oil from water. The American Petroleum

10:24.757 --> 10:28.463
Institute sponsored development of this course. 
It was done under the Engineering Experiment

10:28.843 --> 10:37.216
Station and it was conducted a couple of times and 
then transferred to the Engineering Extension

10:28.843 --> 10:37.216
Service. This is an example of the evolution of 
research to the teaching function and to the

10:37.236 --> 10:46.110
continuing education function. Extension 
Service now teaches about 20 courses per year to

10:46.462 --> 10:59.863
industry to help industry control oil spills and 
to contain oil spills and that sort of thing. We

11:00.464 --> 11:08.557
also have invited people here from the Department 
of Transportation. About two years ago I

11:09.479 --> 11:12.283
sponsored a group here from the Department of 
Transportation, the Coast Guard, and the

11:13.057 --> 11:18.928
Transportation Center in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. As a result of that, several

11:19.089 --> 11:24.158
people have been sponsored. Dr. Tom Ryan and some 
others, Dr. John Painter in electrical

11:24.379 --> 11:35.841
engineering, have evolved a program to evaluate 
the global position system as a Navy satellite to

11:36.496 --> 11:48.332
locate vessels, Coast Guard vessels in this case, 
more accurately than the older systems. Dr. Don

11:48.352 --> 11:57.965
Bray in mechanical engineering has a program on 
rail transportation and non-destructive

11:48.352 --> 11:57.965
testing. These kinds of research projects and 
programs evolved from good relations with

12:03.715 --> 12:15.671
potential sponsors, carrying the flag of Texas 
A&M and helping them to know what the capabilities

12:03.715 --> 12:15.671
of A&M are. And of course, in the final bottom line, 
A&M has to produce good results or they will not be

12:16.712 --> 12:24.803
in business next year. Our good students, our 
graduates, of course, are worldwide now. and the

12:31.205 --> 12:33.908
results of our research are going worldwide. And 
it's an interesting dynamic atmosphere that it's

12:34.970 --> 12:48.427
just, it's been a real rewarding, a very rewarding 
association. I think the Texas legislatures are

12:48.447 --> 13:01.043
doing the right thing and helping develop 
engineering and other research, because that is

12:48.447 --> 13:01.043
the basis for our future. And the future economic 
well-being of this state and of this country

13:02.086 --> 13:22.568
depends a lot on the research that's done today for 
new products for tomorrow.

13:22.588 --> 13:26.392
Dr. Bain, you said that one of the programs here 
that you'd like is the co-op program. Could you

13:26.412 --> 13:27.773
discuss that briefly? The co-op program I think is 
a very fine way for a young person to develop an

13:28.850 --> 13:46.916
association with an industry or with a company and 
help pay for his education.

13:46.936 --> 13:56.410
I think you know or perhaps you don't know that in 
four and a half years a co-op student can get a

13:46.936 --> 13:56.410
degree and pay for his degree and at the same time 
develop these relationships with industry and

13:57.554 --> 14:12.354
end up upon receiving his degree with a job and a 
long-time association with a good company. Many

14:12.374 --> 14:18.662
of the co-ops have been involved in research 
programs with the Engineering Experiment

14:12.374 --> 14:18.662
Station. When I was head of our space technology 
program here, which I was until about the 1950s,

14:26.849 --> 14:28.211
58, 57. We employed co-op students in our flight 
mechanics laboratory and in our wind tunnel

14:30.474 --> 14:42.030
program and in several of our other aerospace 
research programs. We have done evaluation of

14:42.050 --> 14:48.900
some of the thermal protective tiles for the space 
shuttle. That's where you, the one on the top shelf

14:49.160 --> 14:52.986
up there. You shoot small projectiles at those 
tiles to simulate the impact of insulation as the

14:54.727 --> 15:03.617
shuttle takes off. Co-ops were involved in that. 
The co-op student, he just develops a real sense of

15:06.900 --> 15:19.654
the purpose of industry, of the company that he's 
working for, and the importance of doing good

15:06.900 --> 15:19.654
engineering. Then he comes back to school, and he 
goes to school for another semester, and then he

15:20.056 --> 15:24.903
goes back to work again. And he comes back in the 
summer program, and he has to go full-time, work,

15:25.504 --> 15:33.015
study, work, study, for four and a half years. But 
when he gets out, he's a real engineer. This

15:36.901 --> 15:39.264
program, of course, is now university-wide. It 
went from engineering under Dr. McGuire, Dean

15:40.245 --> 15:46.675
McGuire. He didn't have his doctorate. What was 
his first name? Mickey. John. John McGuire. M.C.

15:56.436 --> 15:57.437
or M.A.C.? M.C. McGuire. He was the assistant dean 
for engineering until he retired here about three

15:59.078 --> 16:04.525
years ago. He developed the co-op program here in 
engineering, which then evolved to agriculture,

16:05.185 --> 16:15.116
then it evolved to science, and now it's 
University of Lyon. He did a beautiful job. Could

16:17.009 --> 16:25.440
you tell us something briefly, Dr. Payne, about 
the quality of the engineering student as a whole

16:17.009 --> 16:25.440
since you've been here for the last 10 years? Have 
you seen any changes in the quality? Has the

16:28.183 --> 16:32.349
quality gone down, up, or stayed about the same? 
Well, I think the quality of the students has gone

16:32.369 --> 16:35.052
up. I hope the quality of our education can stay up. 
How selective are you in recruiting students into

16:39.938 --> 16:42.882
engineering? well of course that's on the 
academic side of the house and that's their

16:43.537 --> 17:11.552
responsibility but the requirements for entry 
have been increased the sat score is now i've

16:43.537 --> 17:11.552
forgotten what it is but it's gone up from in the 
last 10 years as part of being more selective of the

16:43.537 --> 17:11.552
students coming in and of course also as part of 
some effort to maintain a top limit on engineering

17:12.038 --> 17:13.599
enrollment. I've seen engineering enrollment go 
from 3,000 students to above 11,000 students. And

17:20.866 --> 17:24.129
this next fall, it's expected to be about 12,000 
students. The quality of the students is good. The

17:29.954 --> 17:32.857
SAT requirements have gone up. A number of 
students come here to take engineering because

17:32.897 --> 17:38.662
they hear that A&M is a tough school. They want the 
challenge of a tough education. They also come

17:42.076 --> 17:47.142
here because their daddies were Aggies. They come 
here because they hear good things about A&M

17:47.162 --> 17:51.487
graduates. They hear about the Aggie spirit. They 
hear about the professionalism of professional

17:53.250 --> 17:57.174
engineers. They hear about the fact that they can 
get a job. Graduates of A&M and the College of

18:01.420 --> 18:09.990
Engineering have no problem whatsoever in having 
a choice, usually, This job or that job, they have

18:10.291 --> 18:15.037
several offers, most many of them do. And their 
salaries are good. So I think that young people are

18:17.140 --> 18:25.410
accepting the challenges of a tough education. 
They're dynamic. They've got many problems yet to

18:27.152 --> 18:30.116
be solved in this world. We old folks haven't 
solved them all. There'll be plenty of problems

18:32.780 --> 18:37.125
around in the future to be solved. I just think the 
quality of the graduates is great. Otherwise,

18:41.764 --> 18:43.246
industry wouldn't come here. What about the large 
number of foreign students coming here? What do

18:47.332 --> 18:49.434
you think motivates them to come here? The same 
reasons? The reasonableness of the cost of

18:51.457 --> 18:56.945
education. The same reasons. You're right. We 
have a large number of foreign students. There's a

19:04.275 --> 19:05.256
problem there. They don't pay the full cost of 
their education. We are a state university. We are

19:09.940 --> 19:13.624
paying part of the cost of educating every student 
that goes through here. So you can say that the

19:14.225 --> 19:18.951
taxpayer is helping to pay for the education of 
foreign students. Now, that's not to say that

19:19.752 --> 19:25.058
foreign students are not making contributions to 
this country, because they are. Many of our

19:25.699 --> 19:29.483
leading scientists are foreign students. And 
let's face it, our ancestors at one time came from

19:29.503 --> 19:32.847
another country. So at one time we were farm 
students in that trailer. But it is a problem

19:38.247 --> 19:44.214
because of the financing requirements. How do you 
pay for the education of these people? We're

19:48.278 --> 19:49.480
paying for it. Is there anything else that we need 
to touch on that we have on? No, I'll just say that I

19:57.168 --> 20:01.213
believe that A&M is great. I believe that carrying 
the flag of Texas A&M to the Washington seat and to

20:02.172 --> 20:11.100
industry is a very gratifying job. I think that 
whoever is assigned as assistant director for

20:11.361 --> 20:27.276
program development in the future I hope has got 
the kinds of background and experiences with the

20:11.361 --> 20:27.276
government and with industry and with the 
research and development. I hope he has had a

20:27.296 --> 20:31.960
background of experience in research and 
development. and that he can help bring great

20:32.513 --> 20:40.564
things to this university and the total system. 
Well, Dr. Maynard, it's been a pleasure

20:42.147 --> 20:48.335
interviewing you, and I appreciate very much your 
patience and kindness. Well, Billy, I appreciate

20:48.355 --> 20:54.284
your approach to this whole thing, and I want to 
wish you all the success in the world. I think you do

20:54.304 --> 20:55.966
a good job.

20:59.551 --> 21:00.192
Thank you. Oh.

21:09.818 --> 21:16.615
Oh.

21:16.635 --> 21:16.695
Oh.
