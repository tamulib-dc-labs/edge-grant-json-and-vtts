Tell us something about your early life, 
including the names of your parents, the dates and

00:02.495 --> 00:24.266
places, if you can, of their birth and death, the 
date and place of your birth, and the schools you

00:02.495 --> 00:24.266
attended before you came to A&M, and any things you 
can remember about your childhood that would be of

00:02.495 --> 00:24.266
interest. Well, my father was W.R. Armstrong. He 
was born... in Dallas County, where White Rock

00:31.300 --> 00:35.504
Lake now is, on a farm. His dad was farming there. 
And my mother was born in Georgia. And she went

00:42.671 --> 00:48.577
through school there in what would now be called 
Junior College, I guess. My father didn't have any

00:49.458 --> 00:53.602
education except what he got in grade school. But 
he did get a teaching certificate and taught

00:54.022 --> 01:01.189
school in Barnesville, which is in Johnson 
County. And my mother was on a farm that belonged to

01:02.738 --> 01:08.924
her parents there. And she played the piano in a 
little schoolhouse where they had church

01:10.085 --> 01:18.213
services. And my dad happened to be teaching at 
that same school. And that's where they met and

01:21.597 --> 01:28.223
married in 1897.

01:28.793 --> 01:37.026
I was born on that farm, my grandmother's farm 
there, out east of Cleburne in 1898.

01:39.690 --> 01:45.258
We lived out there a couple of years and moved into 
Cleburne where I started to school. In 1907,

01:45.278 --> 01:54.733
my dad filed on some land out at Portales, New 
Mexico. This would be a homestead. Homestead. And

01:59.680 --> 02:00.842
we moved out there. He was at that time working for 
the Santa Fe Railroad. They furnished us an

02:05.570 --> 02:15.848
immigrant car in which he put all of our furniture 
and a couple of horses and a couple of cows and some

02:05.570 --> 02:15.848
pigs and chickens and what farm equipment he could 
get in there. Hired a man to ride that car. And we

02:20.633 --> 02:22.936
rode the day coach, of course. We got passive on the 
Santa Fe. Consequently, we had to go from Cleburne

02:26.802 --> 02:32.130
up to Winfield, Kansas, and back to Amarillo. We 
couldn't ride the Fort Worth and Denver because

02:32.150 --> 02:35.375
our pass was not good on it. But anyway, we got back 
through there and settled on a farm in Portales.

02:45.862 --> 02:58.719
The first year there, I went to a little adobe 
one-room schoolhouse, about sixteen pupils, one

02:45.862 --> 02:58.719
teacher, and it was only a five-month school. 
That's all the money they had, so they just wanted

02:58.739 --> 03:03.185
five months and quit. Did the parents pay the 
teacher directly? No, they had—I don't know just

03:05.989 --> 03:10.776
how they worked it. I was just nine years old at the 
time, and I don't remember that. But the next term,

03:16.169 --> 03:33.414
my father taught five months, and then he decided 
that that wasn't any place to raise a family in such

03:16.169 --> 03:33.414
a school as that, so he took us to Amarillo to put us 
in school in 1910. Did the family then move to

03:33.615 --> 03:36.739
Amarillo? The family moved to Amarillo, left the 
farm and moved to Amarillo, and he went to work for

03:37.300 --> 03:45.973
the Santa Fe Railroad in 1910.

03:48.181 --> 03:53.386
And I went through school there, graduated from 
Amarillo High School in 1916.

03:55.888 --> 04:09.701
And I didn't have enough money to go to college, and 
I decided to go to A&M because I could go there

03:55.888 --> 04:09.701
cheaper than anywhere else because I knew they 
wore uniforms and wouldn't have much clothing

03:55.888 --> 04:09.701
expense. And I worked two years in order to get 
enough money to start down there. What type of work

04:17.476 --> 04:18.838
did you do? I went to a business college and got a job 
as a stenographer and file clerk for the Santa Fe

04:20.080 --> 04:28.673
Railroad.

04:31.617 --> 04:44.817
And in 1918, I registered for the draft in July of 
1918, my 20th birthday, and went on down to A&M,

04:31.617 --> 04:44.817
though, and enrolled there. and was inducted into 
the Army in October of 1918. It was inducted into

04:51.435 --> 04:55.199
the SATC. Yeah. And I drew two paydays. And then, of 
course, the armistice came. And they discharged

05:01.466 --> 05:04.690
us on the 21st of December. And I was back home for 
Christmas in 1918. So you went down. Did you go to

05:10.055 --> 05:12.458
A&M and enroll? for school or was the SATC already 
established when you arrived as a freshman? It

05:18.293 --> 05:25.406
wasn't established, I guess, because I enrolled 
in school and went there a couple of months before I

05:18.293 --> 05:25.406
was inducted. All of us that were of that age were 
inducted into the SATC, and the boys that were too

05:25.446 --> 05:34.362
young, of course, continued as cadets. So you were 
two years older than most of the freshmen. Yes.

05:39.067 --> 05:41.750
See, I had stayed out of school. I finished high 
school in 16 and didn't go to A&M until 18 in order to

05:42.390 --> 05:47.975
make enough money to get down there. And I worked 
all the time I was there, whatever I could find to

05:49.536 --> 05:55.401
do, mowing lawns. Would this be mowing lawns for 
the school or for the professors? Professors.

06:01.406 --> 06:04.669
And, of course, in my... junior year I was taking 
civil engineering and I had enough surveying to

06:04.970 --> 06:19.551
get a job with the buildings and grounds committee 
and did some surveying there and set some corners

06:04.970 --> 06:19.551
and street markers and things. This was on the 
campus? On the campus for the buildings and

06:20.913 --> 06:33.492
grounds department and I also did some typing, 
sonography work on the side and of course They had a

06:34.383 --> 06:45.358
crew there with tow sacks and sticks with spikes on 
the end of them to pick up paper and cigarette butts

06:34.383 --> 06:45.358
and things, police campus. I worked at that, oh, 
two or three hours a week, and swept the military

06:45.378 --> 06:57.115
walk from one end to the other, from Speza Hall down 
to Guyon Hall. Was it paved in any way at that point?

06:59.038 --> 06:59.619
It was paved. Guyon Hall was a new hall. Mm-hmm. And 
we got 25 cents an hour for that. That's for

07:06.907 --> 07:07.627
sweeping. For sweeping or for picking up 
cigarette butts. So I got 25 cents an hour for the

07:10.211 --> 07:13.855
lawn mowing. How about for surveying? I don't 
remember what I was paid for that, but it was a

07:16.879 --> 07:21.405
little more than that. It was a little more skill 
required for that, I would think. Yeah. I don't

07:25.330 --> 07:29.415
remember now what it was.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.324
My dad, of course, helped me all he could. I'd get 
enough money to matriculate, sign a note for the

07:37.505 --> 07:44.497
difference, and pay it off as I worked along. 
Occasionally, he'd send a check, which was

07:45.198 --> 07:51.368
pretty... Did you personally sign a note for the 
difference? Yeah. Who sort of underwrote this

07:52.089 --> 07:54.492
note? Nobody. What I mean is, you signed a 
promissory note to the school? Yeah. And any money

07:59.973 --> 08:04.118
you earned was deducted from that amount you owed 
them? Well, no, it was paid to me, and I went and paid

08:04.138 --> 08:08.262
it off. I remember one time in particular, I went 
over there to pay one off, and they said, your dad

08:08.282 --> 08:13.468
just sent the money in. I was real happy about that, 
of course. A little pocket change, then.

08:21.758 --> 08:22.118
Yeah. Okay. Were there any factors other than the 
cost at A&M that led you to go there? Well, of

08:29.673 --> 08:33.157
course, I'd heard of A&M and it appealed to me. I 
didn't know anybody that had been there, just what

08:33.557 --> 08:37.842
I had read about it. But the cost factor was the main 
thing. Did the military appeal to you at all? Not

08:48.934 --> 08:49.955
particularly. In fact, I got out of the military in 
my junior year because of a knee injury. I was no

08:58.478 --> 09:09.012
longer able to stay in the military, so I resigned 
from that and went into the casual hall and

08:58.478 --> 09:09.012
finished as a civilian. So I never did finish the 
ROTC.

09:19.566 --> 09:24.213
Did you go through any particular procedures to be 
admitted to the school? No. Did you send them a

09:26.558 --> 09:31.446
record of your grades or anything, or did you just 
carry that with you? I carried it with me, but I

09:31.466 --> 09:37.195
didn't have any prior correspondence with them. I 
just went off down there and gave them the record

09:37.215 --> 09:42.744
that I had, of course. Was there anybody to meet 
your train when you arrived there? No, because we

09:48.793 --> 09:51.638
went early, and my roommate and I We thought we'd go 
down two or three days early and kind of feel our way

09:53.407 --> 09:58.015
around. Were you able to register immediately, or 
did they have a certain day set aside? Oh, we

10:03.705 --> 10:04.587
registered. We were a couple of days early. We 
registered when we got there. And we were assigned

10:09.215 --> 10:10.878
to a hall. And as I told you, we went up and picked out 
a corner room and fixed it up. But we ended up in the

10:15.926 --> 10:17.389
basement. But by being assigned to a particular 
dorm, that meant you were assigned to a particular

10:17.723 --> 10:23.850
military company. Yes, Company D. Company D. 
Infantry. Were you in that company both years you

10:27.995 --> 10:30.958
were in the military?

10:34.022 --> 10:34.122
Yeah. But, let's see, since they very quickly, 
after you arrived, you discontinued your regular

10:34.142 --> 10:44.053
schooling and got into the SATC. Until SATC, of 
course. Well, it was regular schooling in SATC,

10:46.816 --> 10:51.440
except we had a little more drilling and a little 
more. So you did go to regular classes? Oh, yes.

10:53.682 --> 10:54.923
While you were in the SATC. Couldn't tell any 
differences as far as that's concerned. And then,

10:57.986 --> 11:07.635
I believe from what I have read elsewhere, when 
everybody was discharged from that in December or

10:57.986 --> 11:07.635
thereabouts. December 21st. You came back in 
January and started kind of a whole new year all

11:08.856 --> 11:13.280
over again, I believe, didn't you? And that's when 
they decided to separate the sophomores, put them

11:17.427 --> 11:26.598
in a separate hall, put the freshmen in with the 
juniors and seniors, which wasn't such a good

11:17.427 --> 11:26.598
idea. Well then they made what, a separate company 
out of all the sophomores? Yeah. Except I presume

11:32.504 --> 11:34.827
they had some juniors and senior officers. Oh 
yeah.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.595
What do you think was the reason behind that? to 
stop hazing, cut down on the hazing. The

11:45.210 --> 11:49.196
sophomores were the principal culprits in the 
hazing business. However, of course, the juniors

11:49.216 --> 11:55.525
hazed us more than sophomores did because they 
were right in the building with us. The sophomores

11:55.545 --> 12:01.814
would organize and raid the dormitory where we 
were. Of course, we'd hear them coming, and those

12:01.834 --> 12:07.583
of us that could went to the woods.

12:11.309 --> 12:15.674
What were your first reactions to the school when 
you arrived there? Well, I was real pleased with

12:16.955 --> 12:19.238
it. I liked A&M. And the thing that appealed to me, 
you couldn't tell the difference between a rich

12:22.221 --> 12:28.888
boy and a poor boy. We all looked alike. We all 
dressed alike. And you never knew anything about

12:32.272 --> 12:37.298
what a boy's background was. It was very 
democratic. Well, it was pretty strict on keeping

12:41.549 --> 12:43.371
up the appearance of your uniform? Oh, yes. Yes, 
very strict about our uniforms and our rooms. Did

12:49.838 --> 12:53.642
you have one uniform, two, or three, or how many? 
Well, the government issued us one uniform and an

12:56.084 --> 13:02.931
overcoat and a poncho. We wore ponchos instead of 
raincoats, and of course had to wear hats.

13:10.338 --> 13:12.521
I had two or three uniforms of my own. Of course 
khaki uniform then wasn't very expensive. So you

13:18.851 --> 13:22.417
did have ample opportunity to have your uniform 
cleaned occasionally? Oh yeah. They had laundry

13:24.199 --> 13:25.321
service. They'd back the laundry truck up there 
every Monday or Tuesday, Wednesday, whatever

13:25.341 --> 13:29.748
day. You'd put your laundry out on the stoop and 
they'd pick it up and return it. That was all part of

13:35.777 --> 13:36.919
the whole deal. I take it your uniform was 
identified some way so that they could. Oh yeah it

13:41.925 --> 13:46.552
was all marked just like you'd send it to a laundry 
here. When I went down there I had two or three silk

13:48.876 --> 14:04.020
shirts happened to be a vogue then for boys to wear 
silk shirts which were pretty expensive but I had

13:48.876 --> 14:04.020
bought two or three of them and after I 
matriculated I decided that course we all figured

14:06.312 --> 14:13.281
that we'd be in France before the year was out 
because they were sending them over just fast to

14:06.312 --> 14:13.281
get them ready. So we took our shirts down to the 
mess hall and sold them to the Mexicans. A silk

14:20.890 --> 14:28.180
shirt that had cost us ten dollars we sold for two or 
three dollars to the Mexican help down there. But

14:28.200 --> 14:30.042
of course as soon as we got out of the As soon as we 
were discharged, we were sorry we had done that.

14:35.669 --> 14:39.094
Then we had to go buy everything back, but I didn't 
buy any more silk shirts. Were you permitted to

14:40.656 --> 14:49.270
have refinements, let us say, like a silk shirt as 
part of your uniform? Oh, no. No, these were

14:50.151 --> 14:51.693
civilian. You just wore this when you were off 
campus or something? Yeah. We couldn't wear them

14:54.778 --> 14:56.681
on the campus at all. When we went home at 
Christmas, we could wear them, or went off the

15:00.667 --> 15:05.374
campus, we could wear them, but never on the 
campus. It was strictly military. And they posted

15:08.298 --> 15:15.930
guards in all the dormitories in the evening to 
enforce a curfew. And we had to walk a certain post,

15:17.252 --> 15:22.680
just like a military post would be conducted. Did 
you walk a post in your own dormitory or in some

15:23.180 --> 15:26.165
other one? Well, wherever they'd sign you. As I 
said a while ago, when you were assigned to the

15:29.253 --> 15:34.259
sophomore dormitory, it was pretty rough. You 
were at their mercy then. Yeah. Did you have one man

15:37.243 --> 15:41.969
on each floor of the dormitory, or more than that, 
or less than that? Well, it depended on the

15:42.029 --> 15:44.693
dormitory, how they were arranged. In Foster 
Hall, we just had one man at the floor. Now, in

15:47.136 --> 15:49.559
Mitchell Hall, we had two at the floor. And we had to 
walk the post, walk back and forth all the time with

15:50.520 --> 15:54.625
a rifle. Of course, it was not loaded. It didn't 
have a bayonet or anything, but it and you had to

15:59.527 --> 16:28.757
learn the general orders and the special orders 
and if the officer of the day came up you had to

15:59.527 --> 16:28.757
salute him and tell him what the general orders 
were and what the special order if you had any

15:59.527 --> 16:28.757
trouble you called this corporal of the guard he'd 
send some help uh did you if you had a or assigned

15:59.527 --> 16:28.757
guard duty did you do the whole three-hour trick or 
whatever it was between uh beginning and the end of

15:59.527 --> 16:28.757
quiet hour They'd come around about once a week. 
You'd have to do that. Certain platoons were

16:34.708 --> 16:36.910
assigned a certain days. I see.

16:42.357 --> 16:44.559
The boys had to be in their rooms at 730. Everybody, 
except the seniors, they were exempt because they

16:45.541 --> 16:52.549
were all officers. You didn't have any senior 
privates? No. At various and sundry times, they

16:55.993 --> 16:57.715
had a few senior privates scattered around. Well, 
I don't remember any at that time. Well, of course,

17:03.844 --> 17:17.278
that, I suppose, was a little bit different there, 
at least initially, because a lot of the senior

17:03.844 --> 17:17.278
boys who were seniors probably went off directly 
into the military at the start of their senior

17:03.844 --> 17:17.278
year. In fact, there were very few seniors, very 
few juniors, and very few seniors up until

17:17.358 --> 17:25.947
Christmas, until after the armistice was signed. 
The sophomores pretty well ran things the first

17:27.142 --> 17:31.727
few months. Must have been quite a blow to then have 
the upperclassmen come back after Christmas,

17:31.827 --> 17:36.432
wasn't it? Yeah.

17:39.975 --> 17:45.281
Could you describe a typical day while you were 
there? And I presume in view of the fact that you

17:45.441 --> 17:52.629
were military for two years and civilian for two, 
there was some difference between them. Well, of

17:52.649 --> 17:55.832
course, they blew revelry about daylight. We had 
to stand formation and march to the mess hall,

17:56.960 --> 18:02.849
Speza Hall. Everybody marched down there in 
formation. Had breakfast. And then they left the

18:08.958 --> 18:18.773
hall just as they get through and casually go back 
to the rooms and wait for a class call. Everything

18:19.515 --> 18:20.857
was done by the bugle. You had to go by the bugle. No 
going to class early. And they called you. call you

18:26.761 --> 18:29.966
to class and you go whatever class you were going. 
And certain days during the week, of course, we had

18:31.508 --> 18:39.359
to drill during the morning and that was done by 
bugle call. They'd blow the bugle and if the

18:39.459 --> 18:50.816
weather looked bad, they'd blow overcoat call or 
raincoat call or whatever and you had to wear an

18:39.459 --> 18:50.816
overcoat, whatever. And at noontime at When 
classes were over then, they blew retreat, not

18:55.516 --> 19:12.781
retreat, but recall, and you'd go back to the 
dormitory in formation to go to lunch, march to

18:55.516 --> 19:12.781
lunch in formation. After lunch then, you'd go 
back to your room, and if you didn't have a class,

19:14.584 --> 19:22.435
you were free to do whatever you wanted to do, go to 
work, or study, or sleep, or whatever. And the same

19:28.446 --> 19:30.749
thing was done at supper time. You'd form, again, 
military formation to go to supper. And after

19:36.276 --> 19:41.944
supper then, you were free until 730. And you had to 
be in the room at 730. You had somebody come by to

19:45.689 --> 19:47.672
make sure you were there. Well, they had guards.

19:51.777 --> 19:52.799
check all the rooms. And then at 10 o'clock, or I 
believe it was 9.45 maybe, they blew, I've

19:54.902 --> 20:09.905
forgotten the name of the call, but at 10 o'clock 
was taps. When they blew taps, all the lights went

20:09.925 --> 20:14.411
out and you were supposed to be in bed. No 
activities after taps, except seniors, they

20:14.431 --> 20:20.080
didn't have to go by that. And what about the last 
two years when you were out of the military in the

20:20.617 --> 20:27.627
casual dorm? We had none of that in the casuals. 
Obviously you could be awakened by the bugle in the

20:31.372 --> 20:34.155
morning. Oh, yeah. But we didn't have to march to 
meals. We'd just get up and go to breakfast or go to

20:37.139 --> 20:42.146
meals or miss meal if you want to. But as long as you 
were in the military, you had to report and march

20:43.608 --> 20:49.176
down there. You didn't have to eat. get up and leave 
if you wanted to. If you didn't like what they had,

20:52.225 --> 20:56.892
you could get up and leave. Well, a few times they'd 
feed us, they called it lamb, we called it goat, and

20:56.912 --> 21:16.003
on signal everybody would take the platter of lamb 
out to the middle of the mess hall and dump it all in

20:56.912 --> 21:16.003
the floor, ladders of meat and all. in protest of 
that. It was really good food. They had very good

21:19.897 --> 21:24.042
food.

21:24.062 --> 21:25.925
There were a couple of meals you didn't like.

21:30.411 --> 21:39.302
When you were in the casual dorm or non-military 
dorm,

21:30.411 --> 21:39.302
where did you eat? Did you have a separate section 
set aside? We ate in the same hall but had separate

21:41.285 --> 21:43.948
tables. And of course, the athletes had separate 
tables. And when I got this knee trouble, a doctor

21:49.687 --> 21:57.555
assigned me to a special table, special diet. And 
he assigned me to one of the athletes' tables and

21:58.116 --> 22:05.424
told me to eat lots of steaks and stuff that the 
athletes got. So I did pretty well there. Yeah. I

22:08.287 --> 22:12.872
was going to say, I imagine that didn't bother you 
at all, did you?

22:16.025 --> 22:28.083
I

22:16.025 --> 22:28.083
believe you said when you arrived a little bit 
early and you selected your dormitory room, and

22:16.025 --> 22:28.083
that was again in what dorm? That was in Leggett. 
Leggett, that was your first year. And then you had

22:32.250 --> 22:34.533
to go down, and you ended up in the basement. What 
was the life like in the dormitory there? Well, it

22:39.481 --> 22:44.428
was something, of course, entirely different to 
what I'd ever been used to. But you soon got

22:45.303 --> 22:47.485
accustomed to it. It was not bad. It was really, as I 
look back on it, a very pleasurable time.

22:58.696 --> 23:08.887
Was there a pretty good deal of difference in life, 
say, in the military dorm and the non-military

22:58.696 --> 23:08.887
dorm? Oh, yes. How would you describe the 
difference? Well, of course, in the non-military

23:12.270 --> 23:15.293
dorm, He would just like being at home or being in a 
boarding house. He didn't have a quiet hour? No, he

23:20.710 --> 23:25.398
didn't have any restrictions at all. Because most 
of them were older men that had been in service and

23:25.418 --> 23:33.451
had come back, served their time in France or 
wherever. But I happened to be there because of an

23:34.673 --> 23:36.716
injury. Anybody that had an injury that prevented 
him from Being in the military, you'd be assigned

23:42.762 --> 23:46.866
there. During the time you were there, was there 
ever any option? If you had been in the military for

23:50.490 --> 23:59.378
two years, could you, without giving any other 
reason than that you wanted to, drop out of the

23:50.490 --> 23:59.378
military for the last two? Yes, if you had served 
during the war. You didn't have to take it at all. It

24:07.446 --> 24:08.227
wasn't required. Not for any of the four years. 
They could have let to do it and of course a lot of the

24:11.686 --> 24:26.027
boys that had started out as freshmen and were 
called overseas and came back, of course they went

24:11.686 --> 24:26.027
right back in it because a lot of them liked it. But 
supposing a boy came there in say the year 1919,

24:26.047 --> 24:37.845
1920 and had not been in the military, he just 
finished high school in the spring of 19, and came

24:38.146 --> 24:44.112
there in the fall of 19, was he obligated to do the 
military for four years? I understand that he was.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.376
Unless he had a physical excuse.

24:49.938 --> 24:50.038
Yeah. That was my understanding.

24:56.105 --> 25:04.153
What privileges did the upperclassmen have that 
were denied to the freshmen?

25:04.741 --> 25:10.767
The sophomores didn't have very much of anything, 
and the juniors maybe a little more than the

25:04.741 --> 25:10.767
sophomores. The senior was pretty well on his own. 
Of course, they were the officers.

25:19.255 --> 25:21.137
They had privileges that we didn't have. They 
could go to bond any time they wanted to. We

25:23.760 --> 25:27.663
couldn't get off the campus without a pass any 
time. And they were not allowed to have a car or even

25:29.225 --> 25:33.189
a motorcycle on the campus. Did you have a bicycle? 
Well, I don't remember any that the students had. I

25:38.742 --> 25:41.205
remember some of the professors used bicycles. 
This would be to go from their residence to the

25:41.966 --> 25:46.531
classroom. Most of the professors at that time 
lived on campus. Were there very many of them that

25:50.074 --> 25:51.736
had bicycles? No, the majority of them did not, but 
there were a few that did.

26:01.927 --> 26:04.870
Bicycles were not, I gather at that point, not a 
very prevalent means of transportation anyway.

26:08.235 --> 26:10.419
Many of the professors have cars? No, very few of

26:11.341 --> 26:17.573
them did. For most everybody then it was on foot. 
They ran an interurban car from College Station to

26:22.442 --> 26:27.752
Brown. That's the way we got over to Bryan. When 
we'd get a pass, you'd have to get a pass to go to

26:29.771 --> 26:33.897
Bryan or get off the campus. This was as long as you 
were in the military, you had to have a pass. Yeah.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.065
Casuals did not have to.

26:42.690 --> 26:46.015
What was this, an electric interurban or 
gasoline? Electric.

26:49.801 --> 26:52.304
Any recollection of how much it cost you to ride 
over to Bryan? No, I don't remember.

26:58.546 --> 27:01.950
I guess about 15 cents, but I don't know. For what 
purposes would people go over to Bryan? Oh, just to

27:05.695 --> 27:07.137
get off the campus. Go to the picture show. We could 
go over there and go to the show. If you got back

27:11.282 --> 27:12.664
before taps. That was anybody other than 
freshmen, I presume, could do that. Yeah,

27:17.190 --> 27:19.372
freshmen couldn't get it. Well, sometimes if you 
had relatives there or somebody special,

27:19.472 --> 27:27.102
freshmen could get a pass to get off. But it's very 
rare. Was there any place on or near the campus

27:31.475 --> 27:41.104
that, say, a parent who came down to see their 
children, was there any place they could stay?

27:41.124 --> 27:42.585
Yes, there were some places there. The YMCA had a 
few rooms. My mother came down and, well, my father

27:45.587 --> 27:48.870
was down there once. They stayed at the YMCA. And 
there were some other places there. And I think

27:53.855 --> 27:57.898
some of the professors rented rooms to visitors, 
but you could always find a place in Brown.

28:08.757 --> 28:19.008
When you were in

28:08.757 --> 28:19.008
the non-military group your last two years, the 
dormitory you lived in was Milner Hall. Was that

28:19.789 --> 28:22.992
the only dormitory for non-military or did they 
have any other? I asked at one point, I know they had

28:23.883 --> 28:28.429
a couple that were called Alpha and Beta. Two 
wooden structures. Well, I don't know about that.

28:34.256 --> 28:35.257
That could have been... I believe those were in the 
mid-20s sometime. Must have been later. However,

28:40.904 --> 28:46.411
they still had some of the old military barracks 
there, but I don't know what use they put them

28:40.904 --> 28:46.411
there. That would have been barracks that they 
erected for the regular army who were on campus in

28:46.431 --> 28:51.657
18. Yeah.

28:55.388 --> 29:03.161
What

28:55.388 --> 29:03.161
did you do for entertainment or recreation? Well, 
there wasn't a whole lot that we could do.

29:13.297 --> 29:18.345
They had about once a week, they'd have a picture 
show, a free picture show. Where was that? Well, it

29:20.785 --> 29:22.828
was in a sort of pavilion. I've forgotten what they 
called the thing. Was that the one they called the

29:24.691 --> 29:26.073
air dome? Air dome.

29:29.999 --> 29:34.426
And, oh, once or twice a year they'd have dances. Of 
course, the Ross Volunteers always had some

29:34.707 --> 29:39.214
things going. I didn't belong to the Ross 
Volunteers. But what they had was only for the

29:40.836 --> 29:46.425
members of that group, not for everybody else. And 
they had the... But our time was pretty well taken

29:47.785 --> 29:59.764
up, the time you got through the day and got all your 
studying and your lab work done and your studying

29:47.785 --> 29:59.764
for the next day. It was time for taps.

30:04.371 --> 30:10.100
Were there any facilities in the Y for playing 
games or anything of that nature? Was the swimming

30:10.120 --> 30:11.962
pool in the Y when you were there? Yeah. Was that 
free or did you have to pay for that? I don't know. I

30:17.283 --> 30:18.145
never did use it. I don't know whether it was free or 
not. I wasn't much of a water dog. What else did they

30:23.758 --> 30:25.482
have there besides that? Well, they had game rooms 
where they played different games, dominoes and

30:26.605 --> 30:34.583
checkers and things of that nature.
