WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:16.386
I set

00:01.482 --> 00:16.386
up a consultant service, labor consultant, and 
went to the steamship companies and got them to

00:01.482 --> 00:16.386
retain me.

00:21.875 --> 00:28.165
I was just getting going good when the government 
took over their ships. And this was in 1941, and Joe

00:34.263 --> 00:51.688
Curran asked me to come to Washington as the

00:34.263 --> 00:51.688
legislative representative for the unions, 
maritime unions of the CIO, CIO Maritime

00:34.263 --> 00:51.688
Committee. So that's what I did. I came to 
Washington then. So he appointed you after he had

00:58.410 --> 01:02.336
become a vice president of the CIO? Yeah, he was the 
vice president of the CIO then, but

01:04.359 --> 01:13.353
he didn't appoint me as vice president of the CIO. 
He appointed me as chairman of the CIO Maritime

01:13.393 --> 01:17.198
Committee.

01:20.403 --> 01:23.127
So I came to Washington, and that's my life. spent 
the rest of my life in Washington. I stayed with the

01:27.576 --> 01:52.692
CIO Maritime Committee, and in 1950,

01:27.576 --> 01:52.692
I guess it was, I set up what was known as the Labor 
Management Maritime Committee, because

01:27.576 --> 01:52.692
I realized that unless we can get the industry 
working together, that is, labor and management.

01:56.276 --> 01:57.878
We were never going to get anywhere. So I set up that 
committee, and that's why you see it here on the

01:59.640 --> 02:05.768
present time, I think.

02:08.651 --> 02:10.494
And then, of course, I retired.

02:13.157 --> 02:15.980
And I'm busier now than I was before I retired. Did 
you know a Jerry King? Jerry King? Yes. Knew him

02:21.207 --> 02:22.088
quite well. Uh, what do you think his stand was? His 
stand was? What faction did he fit into? He fitted

02:30.631 --> 02:33.334
into the shipowner faction. Any particular 
shipowning company that might have controlled

02:35.457 --> 02:39.942
him, in your opinion? Uh, I don't know which one, 
but I do know that he was controlled by the ship

02:41.243 --> 02:46.489
companies. When I was told that, I said I don't want 
to know any of the details. If I know any of the

02:50.877 --> 02:53.100
details, I'll go tell the NMU. So don't tell me. So 
did you have any recollections on the Mariners

02:57.907 --> 03:03.275
Club? Not really, except they were trying to take 
over control of the Union and really put it under

03:05.379 --> 03:14.873
the control of the companies. During the war 
years, you spent your time here in Washington.

03:18.568 --> 03:22.412
Yeah.

03:23.394 --> 03:35.247
During this time, in your opinion, did the 
relationship of the government toward the Union,

03:23.394 --> 03:35.247
or the opinion of the government toward the NMU, 
change any? Oh, yes. Can you date that to any

03:37.909 --> 03:44.877
particular time, or what do you think it was, how 
would you describe it before the war started and

03:37.909 --> 03:44.877
then during and after? I would say from the time 
that the government took over the ships their

03:46.696 --> 03:59.413
attitude towards the Union started to change 
because they found that the Union was more

03:46.696 --> 03:59.413
cooperative than ship owners. Why do you think 
this was? Why the Union all of a sudden become

04:02.758 --> 04:05.201
cooperative? Well, I think it was because the 
companies were interested in the money angle and

04:05.221 --> 04:16.416
not so much in the war angle and the Union was more 
interested in the war angle. The Union was

04:19.858 --> 04:24.302
interested in protecting the ships and winning 
the war.

04:28.106 --> 04:41.760
What do you think Admiral Emery Lanz, what was his 
opinion of the NMU and of Joe Kern?

04:41.780 --> 04:45.424
Well, I would say that Emery Lanz, like most of the 
military men at that time were anti-union.

04:52.279 --> 05:02.013
But he was smart enough to recognize that he was 
going to have to have the help of the Union if he was

04:52.279 --> 05:02.013
going to do his job.

05:02.033 --> 05:11.206
So, while he didn't buy everything that they said, 
he did cooperate with them and seek their

05:02.033 --> 05:11.206
cooperation.

05:14.131 --> 05:15.833
And he wouldn't hesitate to to read the right act of 
them just like he would read the right act of the

05:16.572 --> 05:27.803
president if the occasion presented itself.

05:27.823 --> 05:28.744
What about... He was a strong personality, no 
question about it, and to show his interest in the

05:29.224 --> 05:44.959
seamen during the war, seamen were not permitted 
in the clubs of USO

05:29.224 --> 05:44.959
and He was trying to find a way to solve that. So his 
wife suggested to him that maybe they ought to set

05:50.636 --> 05:56.944
up their own clubs for the seamen. He said, that's a 
great idea. I'll take it to the president. He took

06:00.809 --> 06:01.790
it to the president. The president said, I'm all in 
favor of it. But don't let it be a government

06:04.714 --> 06:07.177
organization. Have it a private organization. 
Because if it's not a private organization, it'll

06:09.760 --> 06:13.425
never accomplish its purpose. If it's a 
government organization, it won't. Were you

06:17.609 --> 06:35.555
active in presenting the unions side at the 
December 19, 1941 meeting between the ship

06:17.609 --> 06:35.555
owners, the at that time Maritime Commission, and 
the labor unions and the statement of principles?

06:36.256 --> 06:36.997
Yes, I was. And what was your input into that?

06:42.344 --> 06:46.350
Well, I wrote the final statement. Why wasn't the 
union's original proposals for a tripartite

06:48.507 --> 07:05.030
board acceptable instead of the

06:48.507 --> 07:05.030
mediating board that came out?

07:07.935 --> 07:15.325
Why wasn't the NMU able to get this point of view 
accepted?

07:18.967 --> 07:42.930
I don't remember the details, but I can tell you at 
the time, and

07:18.967 --> 07:42.930
not just at that time, but ever since,

07:18.967 --> 07:42.930
it has been my opinion that government is about the 
worst thing that can happen to any industry, labor

07:18.967 --> 07:42.930
or management. Their intervention into

07:47.114 --> 07:56.547
Business world or labor world is the worst thing 
that can happen for the business or the union or the

07:47.114 --> 07:56.547
country. And if you look at where we are now, you'll 
find that the intervention of government is what

07:58.229 --> 08:05.319
has put us where we are today. If we had a government 
all formed by the people, fine. But we don't. We

08:12.709 --> 08:15.653
have a government all formed by the banking 
industry. They control the banks. They nominate

08:17.920 --> 08:20.043
the president. They elect the president. They 
tell the president what to do. And most

08:24.069 --> 08:27.153
congressmen, they don't tell what to do. They do it 
without being told. What was your relationship

08:31.860 --> 08:36.527
with the WSA, the warship administration? Well, I 
was on the Marine panel.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.138
And I was active in lobbying. the war shipping 
panel itself, and I was very active with Senator

08:44.776 --> 08:52.447
Truman and his committee. I forget the name of the 
committee.

08:58.016 --> 08:59.638
War Production Committee. I don't remember now, 
but he was, he headed up a committee that was the

09:00.960 --> 09:12.437
most influential committee on war matters and on 
shipping matters at the time. And I was very

09:14.476 --> 09:18.961
active, of course, with the staff of that 
committee. I was a lobbyist. I tried to do my job.

09:26.810 --> 09:33.018
What about your relationship and the union's 
relationship with the RMO, Recruitment and

09:26.810 --> 09:33.018
Manning? The Recruitment and Manning 
Organization, RMO.

09:40.186 --> 09:40.827
I don't remember it. It was headed by McCauley? 
Who? McCauley. Captain McCullen?

09:49.525 --> 09:52.209
Oh, he was one of the commissioners.

09:58.120 --> 10:04.311
In particular, what I'm getting at is the 
agreement that was reached in 42. Well, first of

10:05.135 --> 10:23.481
all, the talk of the Merchant Marine being 
nationalized and placed under the Navy, and then

10:05.135 --> 10:23.481
the subsequent agreements that come out between 
Lundberg and the WSA, and then later on the NMU and

10:05.135 --> 10:23.481
their relationship, their agreement with 
Admiral Land. I don't remember much of the

10:24.923 --> 10:33.876
details, but I do remember McCauley and we being 
very close. We felt that McCauley was

10:34.987 --> 10:47.420
the one commissioner at that time who we could rely 
upon to be fair. During the war time, was there any

10:49.322 --> 10:58.752
fear by the NMU that the government and or the 
operators were attempting in some way to destroy

10:49.322 --> 10:58.752
the hiring hall? Oh, yes. And if so, what would the 
union have been prepared to do? More or less, would

11:05.007 --> 11:10.735
they have, or did Cheran and the NMU ever consider 
the possibility of dropping the no-strike

11:05.007 --> 11:10.735
pledge?

11:13.599 --> 11:20.989
If they had gotten down to really destroying the 
Union Hall, there would have been a strike threat.

11:21.009 --> 11:23.412
There would have been a strike, not just a strike 
threat. There would have been a strike. No

11:26.316 --> 11:27.538
question about it. Had there ever been any, were 
there ever any contingency plans made by the Union

11:30.252 --> 11:34.817
for a strike during? No. Would you consider this 
then a type of act of faith as far as the Union goes in

11:36.759 --> 11:46.269
unilaterally declaring this no-strike pledge 
the day after Pearl Harbor? Was this tactically

11:47.651 --> 11:55.019
done by Curran, or was it strictly good faith, or 
was he hoping for something down the road to come

11:47.651 --> 11:55.019
out of this? Or was it just a pure act of patriotism? 
Well, he... The Union was 100% for winning the war,

12:00.070 --> 12:10.883
so the Union was all behind all efforts to win that 
war, no question about it. Up to but not including

12:10.903 --> 12:14.027
losing the hiring hall. Well, this is pure 
guesswork on my part, but I don't think they would

12:14.047 --> 12:26.162
have permitted the hiring hall to be destroyed. 
because they knew if that were destroyed, they

12:27.813 --> 12:31.298
wouldn't have a Union after the war.

12:34.203 --> 12:44.780
Who was influential in talking Joe into shipping 
out his Navy during the war to check the seamen's

12:34.203 --> 12:44.780
conditions abroad? Nobody. That was just his own? 
That was his own idea. He wanted to find out what

12:49.467 --> 12:55.356
could be done to improve the war effort. And that's 
what he wanted to do. He wanted to go see firsthand

13:02.709 --> 13:07.274
what was happening then. The Union begins 
developing a post-war program around 1943. How

13:14.122 --> 13:16.825
much input did you have into this? Probably all of 
it. Would you like to go into more detail? Well,

13:30.166 --> 13:55.617
No one

13:30.166 --> 13:55.617
in the NMU was thinking of anything after the war.

13:59.343 --> 14:06.992
As a matter of fact, there literally has never been 
any planning in the NMU. It went along from day to

14:08.834 --> 14:10.236
day. And I told Joe, there's about time we started 
to think of some of those things. About when was it

14:16.903 --> 14:22.069
approximately?

14:22.089 --> 14:27.055
I'd say probably about 43 or somewhere in there.

14:30.140 --> 14:40.834
So I got to talking about it, and

14:30.140 --> 14:40.834
Harry Bridges happened to come to town while Joe 
happened to be in town. I forget what it may have

14:40.914 --> 14:42.756
been, a committee meeting. I don't know. And I told 
him some of my ideas, some of the things that I

14:44.618 --> 14:48.924
thought we ought to be talking about. And I said, 
for example, I think

14:48.944 --> 14:59.978
one of the most important things that could be done 
right now in terms of war has nothing to do with the

15:00.447 --> 15:08.656
future, but actually winning the war is 
containerization.

15:11.019 --> 15:17.586
So we got to talking about that, and Harry was 
interested, and he said, will you prepare me a

15:11.019 --> 15:17.586
paper on it? So I prepared him a paper, and that was 
the beginning of the container ships, really. And

15:25.815 --> 15:27.197
I went to First time I was in New York, I went to see 
Franklin, who was United States lines, and Emmett

15:28.139 --> 15:56.695
McCormick of more McCormick lines, and told them 
that I thought they ought to be thinking in terms of

15:28.139 --> 15:56.695
building container ships, because this is where 
cargo is going to end up in the commerce of the

15:28.139 --> 15:56.695
world. Neither one of them could see it. No 
business. And then when I developed the program, I

16:02.419 --> 16:08.167
told them that the... I went back to these same two 
guys in connection with one thing, and that was

16:08.187 --> 16:16.318
the, you know, shipping after the war. Because 
this time I was working on, you know, what the

16:16.919 --> 16:23.307
program was going to be like after the war. And I got 
into... whole question of how many ships we were

16:27.488 --> 16:35.817
going to have, and that meant bottom dropping out 
of shipping as far as companies and unions were

16:27.488 --> 16:35.817
concerned.

16:39.020 --> 16:41.463
And Joe wouldn't believe me at all. He said, it just 
isn't going to happen. We're going to continue

16:43.585 --> 16:45.908
having a good merchant marine. And I depicted a cut 
in ships. I said, you've got to think of other

16:51.574 --> 16:53.315
things. Well, before I get to that, I started to 
tell about this these two guys, two main guys

16:57.374 --> 17:02.500
really in shipping at that time. And I suggested to 
them that in addition, I said, you couldn't see

17:04.462 --> 17:17.877
light on this question of

17:04.462 --> 17:17.877
container ships. But I said, the big need for the 
United States after the war is going to be bulk

17:19.318 --> 17:26.166
ships. tankers and ore carriers.

17:31.358 --> 17:36.523
I said, why don't you give some thought to 
investing money in either one of these? Because

17:37.384 --> 17:39.105
there's money to be made in it. So they said, well, 
now, bulk carriers is an idea. Let's explore that.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.616
What's your idea on the bulk carriers? So I told 
them the kind of ships I was thinking of, 100,000

17:50.677 --> 17:54.921
ton ships. never heard of, you know. You were 
talking the big ships at that time was 15,000 tons.

18:02.567 --> 18:06.751
That was a big ship. They couldn't see ships of that 
size. I said, well, you go talk to the people that

18:08.893 --> 18:16.020
have to import this ore, and see what they think of 
it. And then I projected to them my idea of where we

18:16.040 --> 18:24.148
were headed, both in terms of petroleum and ore 
products. And I told them that our supplies in the

18:27.723 --> 18:34.090
United States just weren't going to be adequate. I 
said, by the year 2000, we'll be importing at least

18:35.091 --> 18:45.262
eighty to ninety percent of ore and oil. And this 
they couldn't see. None of these people had any

18:48.405 --> 18:50.707
visions at all. I don't understand why they 
couldn't see what was happening. But I said, well,

18:56.174 --> 19:00.218
I don't have the statistics on this, but I'm going 
to get them. I'll get them together, and I'll show

19:00.999 --> 19:02.981
them to you. And I said, you just have to realize 
that with the kind of economy that we have and the

19:03.041 --> 19:18.258
growth that is essential to meet the minimum 
employment needs of this nation are just going to

19:03.041 --> 19:18.258
have to skyrocket. You just won't be able to 
believe it. But they said, well, I've How in the

19:25.503 --> 19:27.886
world do you think we can get in the ore trade?

19:30.949 --> 19:34.613
I said, first of all, you have to get off your ass and 
stop thinking of subsidies. Because at one time or

19:36.115 --> 19:40.279
another, the government's going to cut out these 
subsidies, and they ought to cut them out. The only

19:41.260 --> 19:49.809
reason for a subsidy, really, is for national 
defense and for protecting our commerce. Have

19:50.190 --> 19:51.291
enough ships to protect their commerce against 
high rates from foreign ships. That's the only two

19:55.750 --> 19:59.215
reasons you can give for it, and you know it. I said, 
this business of living off of Uncle Sam is just a

19:59.235 --> 20:06.284
lazy man's way, and you ought to start using your 
head on these things. I said, if I were a ship owner,

20:06.885 --> 20:20.923
I would go to U.S. Steel, I would go to American 
Aluminum, and organizations like this that are

20:06.885 --> 20:20.923
going to be importing bulk ores, and I would go to 
Companies like Standard Oil of New Jersey, Shell,

20:21.342 --> 20:33.019
who charter at least half of their ships and work 
out some deals with them. Well, that sounds like a

20:33.039 --> 20:34.721
good idea. Never got off the ground, but it was a 
good idea. But

20:38.566 --> 20:49.662
really,

20:38.566 --> 20:49.662
the shipping industry in the United States was, 
you know, built on subsidies. That's all they

20:51.074 --> 20:52.196
could think of. You can't compete with 
foreigners. And I kept telling them they were

20:54.719 --> 20:56.482
crazy. They just had to get more production. You 
had to get bigger ships, like any other industry.

21:04.072 --> 21:07.237
If you're going to create wealth, you've got to 
create production. If you're going to create

21:08.939 --> 21:17.691
production, you've got to have labor

21:08.939 --> 21:17.691
interchange. The whole system is built on 
interchange of labor. It started off with the

21:22.410 --> 21:30.681
shoemaker making shoes for the hat maker, and the 
hat maker hats for the shoemakers, and the baker,

21:22.410 --> 21:30.681
baker for both of them. And that's the way it 
started off. But you're not living in that kind of

21:33.104 --> 21:35.688
economy anymore. You're living in a very 
fast-growing economy that's going to be

21:35.728 --> 21:43.678
monetized, and you have to be thinking in those 
terms.

21:46.392 --> 21:53.583
And I said, the people who are going to be 
successful are going to be the people who design

21:46.392 --> 21:53.583
and operate the most efficient ships. And the most 
efficient ships is going to be a ship that's going

21:54.564 --> 22:04.659
to carry 10 times as much cargo as you carry now with 
the same crew or maybe even less crew. I said, for

22:05.300 --> 22:08.785
example, you know you can operate a ship without 
any crew on it at all. But think in terms of it as the

22:10.608 --> 22:14.914
same crew for the larger ship. Well, they thought 
on it, but never did anything about it. Other

22:19.981 --> 22:23.705
entrepreneurs came along and did the job for them. 
But specifically for the NMU, I showed them what

22:24.907 --> 22:30.614
their membership was going to shrink from. I 
forget what it was right after the war. It seems to

22:34.058 --> 22:37.062
me it was about 125,000 members. And I told them 
that that job program would probably shrink to

22:38.403 --> 22:46.133
deep sea of between 10 and 20,000 people. I said, 
you just have to think in those terms. That means

22:52.831 --> 22:56.056
you've got to get out and organize other people. 
The natural thing that I think you should do is to

22:56.596 --> 23:04.527
organize the people who work in the steamship 
companies. That's a natural for you. Then I gave

23:07.391 --> 23:13.960
them a few other ideas of associated industries 
that would seem to make some sense. to people that I

23:14.395 --> 23:19.121
knew were absolutely opposed to anything except 
semen in their union. Was Karen receptor to the

23:21.003 --> 23:22.965
United? He was not. Absolutely not. Nothing but 
semen in his union. And he went on like that almost

23:28.812 --> 23:31.295
till the end.

23:35.521 --> 23:43.390
And it was just sheer necessity of staying alive 
that finally convinced him that he had to do

23:35.521 --> 23:43.390
something else. And then they started organizing 
other people.

23:49.799 --> 23:58.210
Who was the driving force behind developing the 
PAC movement during the war, the Political Action

23:49.799 --> 23:58.210
Committee?

24:05.699 --> 24:07.181
Whose brainchild was that?

24:11.447 --> 24:12.448
Oh, what's his name? head of the garment workers, 
Goldman. Lewis, was it Lewis Goldman? Well,

24:22.631 --> 24:27.319
specifically in the NMU, who was receptive to the 
idea?

24:31.185 --> 24:32.287
I'm not really sure.

24:36.794 --> 24:40.900
I think it was really an outgrowth of what was 
happening. I think we all realized that the

24:42.668 --> 24:48.576
Washington scene had to be covered. That there 
were about, as I recall, 23

24:49.678 --> 25:03.557
agencies in Washington who had something to do 
with the maritime industry. And I don't think this

25:03.577 --> 25:10.347
was anyone's idea specifically that you know, of 
coming forth with the idea that this had to be done.

25:16.019 --> 25:22.849
I think it was just a natural outgrowth of the fact 
that we were dealing with these things all the time

25:16.019 --> 25:22.849
and this had to be done. And I know that this idea 
finally took head. The NMU was the first one to put

25:31.742 --> 25:34.446
someone down here. I don't remember what his name 
was now, but they had a representative down here.

25:41.562 --> 25:45.607
before, I think, even before the CIO was formed. 
But when the CIO was formed,

25:47.129 --> 26:03.708
Joe suggested that everyone get together and set 
up this committee and have representation here at

25:47.129 --> 26:03.708
the Washington level, and that's what was done. 
That was when the CIO Maritime Committee was set

26:03.748 --> 26:06.912
up. So I don't think it was anyone's idea as such, 
just the need was there and had to be met. Was this

26:18.316 --> 26:21.519
acceptable also to the left-wing or the communist 
factions? Yes, it was. They understood the need

26:22.480 --> 26:24.262
also? Yeah. Probably, if you take it back, the 
Copland book was probably the bellwether of the

26:26.964 --> 26:32.910
whole thing. I'm really not sure.

26:37.132 --> 26:42.959
I don't remember anyone coming up with the idea 
that, you know, we've got to have representation

26:37.132 --> 26:42.959
in Washington. I think everyone knew we had to have 
representation in Washington because of the

26:43.199 --> 26:49.687
situation that existed.

26:54.032 --> 27:04.624
Going back to the Curran-Bridges relationship, 
it seems to me that we even put in the NMU

26:54.032 --> 27:04.624
Constitution representation in Washington.

27:07.304 --> 27:09.226
I think we did, as a matter of fact. But you know, 
we'd been through the NRA already, and all of

27:10.027 --> 27:19.596
Roosevelt's so-called recovery programs by 
then.

27:25.082 --> 27:36.653
As far as Curran and Bridges goes, and their 
relationship,

27:25.082 --> 27:36.653
could you pick up on that particularly, say, from 
the beginning of the war on? Their relationship

27:39.569 --> 27:45.456
was purely a relationship of mutual help for each 
other's union. Neither one of them really had any

27:47.878 --> 27:50.241
use for the other one. Personally, I'm talking on a 
personal basis now. But they both recognized that

27:55.427 --> 27:59.311
they needed help from each other. And to get help 
from each other, they ought to help each other. And

28:04.697 --> 28:08.361
it was just, again, the awareness of the of the 
needs. Who was the person within the NMU then that

28:10.727 --> 28:28.828
started the idea of the Union backing Bridges so 
strongly in his deportation hearings,

28:10.727 --> 28:28.828
particularly in 39 and the deportation hearings 
in 42, to the point where they issued fighting

28:10.727 --> 28:28.828
stamps? I think this was an ILA program that was 
started on the West Coast and got the support of the

28:39.897 --> 28:45.182
And Bridges brought it to the CIO Maritime 
Committee, too, of course. And there just wasn't

28:45.202 --> 28:46.563
any question. There was, at that time, in the 
movement,

28:46.583 --> 29:03.338
there was never any question but what one union was 
going to support the other maritime union. On any

29:03.558 --> 29:04.259
issue. Didn't make any difference what the issue 
was. They just supported it. If one union put up a

29:08.045 --> 29:13.333
picket line, another one is not going to touch it. 
There was just that much solidarity and that much

29:13.353 --> 29:20.764
understanding of the need to help each other at 
that time. Even if it meant crossing ideological

29:23.469 --> 29:26.173
boundaries?

29:33.123 --> 29:35.487
Well, I think each one of these, had their 
ideological

29:36.327 --> 29:56.688
reasons also, because they were, if you're 
building a base, you know, for your party guys on

29:36.327 --> 29:56.688
anything you do, if you're strengthening the 
organization, you're building a party base. I can

29:58.529 --> 30:03.094
remember a meeting that we had here in Washington 
where we were talking about the 40-hour week. This

30:08.558 --> 30:18.050
grew out of my suggestion to the seamen that they 
ought to start thinking in terms of more

30:08.558 --> 30:18.050
employment aboard the ships. When would this be, 
after the war? Beg your pardon? When would this be?

30:20.974 --> 30:22.156
This was after the war. It may have not been after 
the war. It may have been just before the war ended.

30:28.083 --> 30:30.887
I'm not just sure of the timing on it. But anyway, I 
came up with the idea that we ought to think in terms

30:32.234 --> 30:39.262
of putting more people on the ship. And doing this, 
think of a 40-hour week.

30:46.370 --> 30:59.946
And I was thinking purely of the employment 
situation, because it was perfectly obvious to me

30:46.370 --> 30:59.946
that we were going to have a tremendous drop in the 
employment of merchant seamen.

31:02.407 --> 31:16.926
I guess this would have had to have been after the

31:02.407 --> 31:16.926
general who became Secretary of State, Marshall, 
after the Marshall Plan. It became perfectly

31:18.729 --> 31:28.161
obvious to me that we were going to not only rebuild 
the European allies industries, but we were going

31:28.765 --> 31:32.549
to rebuild their merchant marines, too. If we 
rebuild their merchant marine, that meant that

31:34.070 --> 31:47.464
our shipping was going to drop down from about 
sixty percent to, I was figuring ten percent as the

31:34.070 --> 31:47.464
lowest, but of course it didn't hold there.

31:50.807 --> 31:55.472
Do you remember Joe's pamphlet, Porkchops and 
Politics? Did he write that, or was it

31:55.492 --> 31:57.574
ghostwritten? Joe wrote everything that his name 
was on. Well, I'll take that back now. There's some

32:05.482 --> 32:08.706
of these books that were written that his name was 
put on them. But for example, his column in the

32:09.167 --> 32:15.195
paper, he literally wrote every one of those 
himself. And the pork chops thing, I'm sure he

32:16.397 --> 32:18.981
wrote too. But it was edited, of course, after he 
wrote it. And his column was frequently edited.

32:25.129 --> 32:27.072
Not all the time, but frequently edited. If he had a 
good editor, it was edited. If he didn't have a good

32:29.958 --> 32:33.822
editor, it wasn't edited. I know when Bernie 
Raskin was editor, he edited all of Joe's columns.

32:42.831 --> 32:51.661
So I don't remember the details on pork chops, but I 
feel sure it was edited, but I also feel sure that

32:42.831 --> 32:51.661
Joe wrote it.

32:55.525 --> 32:57.447
Joe grew in the job. be a very capable person.

33:03.912 --> 33:10.280
I would say really that there were, and

33:03.912 --> 33:10.280
this is definitely off the record.

33:13.845 --> 33:24.700
Concerning the development during the war of the 
Committee for Maritime Unity, what was your stand

33:13.845 --> 33:24.700
as far as this goes and the NMU?

33:29.033 --> 33:45.678
I think at that time the only role I had in it was as a 
functionary trying to come up with ideas and ways

33:29.033 --> 33:45.678
to try to bring it forward and to make it work.

33:45.698 --> 33:49.183
I think originally I told Joe that I never had any 
hopes for it. I told him, I said, I think you are just

33:51.908 --> 33:58.197
barking up the tree if you think you'll ever get 
Lundberg, really. to

33:58.987 --> 34:11.906
honestly participate in maritime unity where you 
or

33:58.987 --> 34:11.906
Bridges are concerned. As far as this maritime 
committee, unity committee goes, when or how was

34:14.089 --> 34:28.791
it that Joe began to perceive that he and Bridges 
were coming to a loggerhead? Was this, again, an

34:30.728 --> 34:39.561
ego clash,

34:30.728 --> 34:39.561
or was there something else that started to put the 
wedge between Kieran and Bridges? Because

34:39.581 --> 34:42.646
apparently they had a very close, at least 
working, relationship for quite a while. Yes,

34:43.086 --> 34:46.451
they did have a close relationship.

34:47.453 --> 35:00.432
I think the thing that did that was a fellow with the 
name of Goldblatt, who became

34:47.453 --> 35:00.432
secretary-treasurer of the ILWU and became a... 
What do you call it? Well, he was looking for

35:05.090 --> 35:09.475
Bridges' job.

35:09.495 --> 35:16.304
And I think that he drove a wedge between Bridges 
and Curran. I think that's, that's the really

35:18.327 --> 35:22.712
where this started. He also was a party 
functionary.

35:28.154 --> 35:30.416
not just a member, he was a party functionary. I 
don't know what function he had now, I don't

35:30.436 --> 35:32.718
remember. But he perceived Joe as being too strong 
a person for the party to take on, and him

35:34.400 --> 35:53.839
personally to take on, and he couldn't perceive of 
anyone in the maritime industry being more

35:34.400 --> 35:53.839
important than he was. And this was another case of 
a a person of small stature

35:58.647 --> 36:11.242
not being able to work with someone, physically 
I'm talking about, physically larger stature.

36:12.563 --> 36:15.507
And that literally was that he was that kind of a 
person. When was it that Joe began to perceive that

36:16.969 --> 36:26.680
he was going to have to have some type of a clash with 
the communist elements within the Union? And I'm

36:28.229 --> 36:32.695
trying to think of the incident.

36:40.925 --> 36:41.666
There was something. I know what it was, the 
Standard Oil strike. This was the key to that. It

36:47.414 --> 36:48.996
was early as 39. Yeah, that was the key to it. You 
think had there been no World War II that there

36:51.339 --> 36:56.966
might have been a clash earlier in 45? Probably. 
probably. But the war set that aside, because he

36:59.990 --> 37:14.503
finally perceived, recognized that this was a 
hell of a mistake that he let the muckery into. Why

37:16.825 --> 37:25.773
did the, during this time then, did Joe allow the 
press to continue branding him as a communist?

37:25.793 --> 37:26.974
Well, how was he going to keep from being branded. 
They branded me as a communist, too. So he had no

37:35.588 --> 37:40.414
input or no inside contacts with the press, did he? 
Sure you have any contacts, but those contacts

37:40.434 --> 37:47.803
don't control the policy of the press, just like 
they don't control it today.

37:50.506 --> 37:56.353
The powers that run the country control the press, 
and they'll print what they want to print. For

37:56.823 --> 38:08.437
example, you don't find them printing that the 
Federal Reserve

37:56.823 --> 38:08.437
steals the money from the people of the United 
States, do you? You don't find them printing that

38:11.140 --> 38:19.591
the activities of the Federal Reserve cause the 
depressions and the unemployment?

38:21.894 --> 38:23.676
They're responsible for the inflation. You don't 
find that in the press. When Curran finally

38:27.991 --> 38:38.766
decided that he had to take on the Communist 
elements, was this a personal decision, or did he

38:27.991 --> 38:38.766
have other people counseling him? And if so, when 
did he start to work out a strategy? Well, all along

38:42.652 --> 38:55.450
the line, he had a strategy

38:42.652 --> 38:55.450
to not let the Communist Party program become a 
program of the Union. As I've mentioned earlier,

38:59.875 --> 39:08.227
the program was to serve the Union, serve the 
members, and not the Communist Party. Now, as long

39:09.168 --> 39:25.572
as the Communist Party was willing to work for 
those programs which served the Union and let that

39:09.168 --> 39:25.572
serve themselves, there was no problem. It's only 
when you come to a point where their activities

39:26.345 --> 39:37.918
were inimical to the best interest of the 
membership of the Union. When do you think, then,

39:38.598 --> 39:43.764
that the working relationship between Kirillin 
and the communists began to break down?

39:52.694 --> 39:56.318
There was some incident just before this

39:58.508 --> 40:17.729
convention that you referred to,

39:58.508 --> 40:17.729
and Joe asked me if I would go to the Communist Party 
leadership and explain to them what I perceived

39:58.508 --> 40:17.729
the Communists were trying to do to the Union. And 
this was after Lannan, you mentioned Lannan, Al

40:20.291 --> 40:26.558
Lannan, That's after he became the chief 
waterfront guy. So I had, I went, literally went

40:32.352 --> 40:47.520
down to the communist headquarters, I think they 
were on 14th Street, I'm not sure now, and talked

40:32.352 --> 40:47.520
with someone there that I had known previously, a 
woman, I don't remember her name. She was a big wig

40:48.863 --> 40:50.706
in the party. and told her and another guy who was 
also big with what was going on in the Union. These

40:57.956 --> 41:09.868
guys were really trying to control the Union for 
their own personal interest as well as for the

40:57.956 --> 41:09.868
party's interest and not the seamen's interest. 
Of course, I recognized their goal was pure party.

41:16.354 --> 41:19.157
But I told her, I said, they're not going to control 
it. That way, if they're going to part with Joe on

41:21.263 --> 41:30.814
the issue of doing what's best for the seamen, 
they're going to lose. And you'd better make up

41:31.595 --> 41:33.257
your mind to this. But I don't remember now what the 
issues were, but this happened. And this is while I

41:41.547 --> 41:45.272
was working with Standard Oil of New Jersey. So it 
was before I came to Washington.

41:50.812 --> 41:55.558
Anyway, the party said, well, now who we're going 
to believe? Our, uh, Lannan and Blackie Mars and

41:55.698 --> 42:05.549
Jack Lawrence and so on and so on tell us this, and 
you and Joe telling us something else. Well, I

42:05.810 --> 42:16.262
said,

42:05.810 --> 42:16.262
uh, Joe doesn't want a fight with the Communist 
Party because he thinks it will hurt the Union. And

42:18.425 --> 42:20.447
if it hurts the Union, it's going to hurt the 
seamen. And that's the primary thing he's

42:22.878 --> 42:25.161
interested in. That's the primary thing the 
Union's interested in, the only thing the Union is

42:25.201 --> 42:29.708
interested in. He said, now, if you want to try to 
control the Union for the interests of the

42:30.690 --> 42:38.922
Communist Party, in the face of that, that's your 
decision to make. And they said, well, we'll

42:40.544 --> 42:44.270
discuss it with them some more. But I want to tell 
you frankly, Hoyt, that we have no hopes of

42:44.350 --> 42:49.658
changing the situation. So they wanted the 
party's leaders wanted to continue to... They

42:54.022 --> 42:57.607
wanted the party at that point to take over the 
Union, I think. This would have been... I'm not

43:01.071 --> 43:02.193
sure of the year. During the war? Beg your pardon? 
During the war?

43:08.382 --> 43:10.104
Yes, it would have to be...

43:18.656 --> 43:19.577
I just don't remember. This may have been after the 
war. I really don't remember. Was there

43:22.967 --> 43:30.698
anybody... No, this would have had to have been 
during the war, definitely during the war. Was

43:31.739 --> 43:38.929
there anybody advising Kieran to begin purging 
the communists? Well, he was always being advised

43:39.009 --> 43:41.232
to do this. Anybody specifically, beside 
yourself? No, I didn't advise him to purge, no. No,

43:49.173 --> 43:50.575
I didn't advise him to purge. Matter of fact, I 
didn't think he could. Was there anybody inside

43:54.659 --> 44:01.987
the government who might have been...

43:54.659 --> 44:01.987
Not that I know of. Not that I know of. I don't think 
anyone was really advising him to purge the Union.

44:07.974 --> 44:17.104
I know that people were from time to time, as they 
did with me, raised the question of when is he going

44:07.974 --> 44:17.104
to get rid of that... communist control in the 
Union. I said, well, how would you, wouldn't

44:20.460 --> 44:26.167
anyone raise it with me? I'd ask them, how would you 
go about it? I said, I've thought of this many

44:28.490 --> 44:30.112
times. And I've always come to the conclusion that 
I didn't think he could do it. And I didn't because

44:35.780 --> 44:39.184
there were more of them than there were of him. And I 
would say that 90% of the officers of the Union were

44:40.305 --> 44:47.074
communists. I know at one time that all of the 
officers of the national office were communists

44:48.691 --> 44:58.505
except Joe, and certainly most of the port agents. 
So in your opinion then, when the showdown began in

44:59.707 --> 45:07.858
1945, it was the communists felt that they were 
strong enough to purge Joe and not vice versa?

45:07.878 --> 45:08.359
That's right. So they made the first move, not Joe? 
They made the first move. And he acted defensively

45:11.864 --> 45:13.326
then? That's

45:13.346 --> 45:18.073
right. That started out trying to build himself up 
in the Union

45:19.657 --> 45:39.517
without giving

45:19.657 --> 45:39.517
Bridges any idea that he was going to replace 
Bridges.

45:39.537 --> 45:49.647
And I think he simply perceived that one of the ways 
to do this was to create a real split between Curran

45:39.537 --> 45:49.647
and Bridges.
