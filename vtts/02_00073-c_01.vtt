00:02.731 --> 00:14.511
The Brown University expected their applicants 
for their school to have something in their

00:02.731 --> 00:14.511
background besides academics. Work, 
extracurricular activities, social

00:14.531 --> 00:20.522
activities, social interaction. They wanted 
people who could fit in society. and who had the

00:24.972 --> 00:30.438
ambition and the goals to achieve something when 
they get done. And this is why I was real strong in

00:31.740 --> 00:48.319
the selection process for musicians, athletes, 
particularly individual sport athletes, and

00:31.740 --> 00:48.319
people that are interested in art. Because you 
only get good in those areas by individual effort

00:49.020 --> 00:54.186
and dedication. You can't learn to play the piano 
by sitting down. You can't learn to jump in the

00:58.066 --> 00:59.667
water. Based on your experience, what would be the 
most important single fact?

01:14.842 --> 01:15.883
One of all, and that's desire. How do you make it? 
You don't. You just have to believe in them.

01:33.181 --> 01:43.991
As

01:33.181 --> 01:43.991
you know from picking associates and flirting 
graduates, you've got to believe it. If all you

01:44.011 --> 01:46.974
take is a transcript, what do you have? You have a 
transcript. In general, how long would you sleep?

01:50.658 --> 01:54.521
Yeah, I could do it for a few

01:50.658 --> 01:54.521
days. Undergraduates go to high school, 
university, in something like 1959 or 1970. In

01:57.845 --> 02:00.387
three semesters, she was able to accumulate 16 
grades at DNF. Thank you. Thank you.

02:23.654 --> 02:28.108
Well, for the most part, they had no way to forget 
anything. They had no choice but to get it raised,

02:28.128 --> 02:33.585
and they took everything, and put it on the moon, 
and, uh, they were good, and they were

02:28.128 --> 02:33.585
self-admitted, just out of the question. They 
didn't think it was over. How did they no longer

02:34.488 --> 02:35.531
identify as the angel? Uh, they, uh, they, uh, 
they, uh, they, uh, they, uh, they, uh, they, uh, . .

02:39.955 --> 03:02.571
.

03:04.222 --> 03:18.855
Thank

03:04.222 --> 03:18.855
you.

03:31.289 --> 03:45.788
Shh!

03:54.695 --> 04:04.688
Thank

03:54.695 --> 04:04.688
you.

04:43.244 --> 05:08.138
Okay,

04:43.244 --> 05:08.138
there it goes. What I'm worried about is how much we 
didn't get.

05:17.556 --> 05:19.218
That's why I keep glancing at it. You were talking 
about proud moments with the students. Do you

05:26.407 --> 05:37.500
remember any times when an Aggie tried to pull your 
leg and give you an excuse that you knew was really

05:26.407 --> 05:37.500
far-fetched? No, not that I was aware of. I think 
the most disturbing thing every first day of

05:45.674 --> 05:58.172
class, and I always ask them to fill out a card with 
some information about themselves. and where

05:58.456 --> 06:01.961
they were from, and how to pronounce their name, 
and a few other things. And I remember, I don't

06:02.482 --> 06:04.345
remember her name. And goodness, I don't remember 
her name. But this one young lady wrote on hers,

06:06.969 --> 06:11.335
I'll do anything to get an A in this class. And I 
didn't chase that anywhere. But of all the women

06:17.004 --> 06:26.438
that I taught, that's the only really outward 
proposition

06:28.021 --> 06:32.563
No good old boy said that his grandfather might die 
the first day of deer season.

10:59.590 --> 11:05.290
You'll take a calendar, a year's calendar, and put 
it up on the wall and throw a dart at it. And whatever

11:05.952 --> 11:09.043
day that dart hits, you'll have a cold that day.

12:40.537 --> 12:41.840
I think that.

13:05.933 --> 13:06.894
straight to them. I got such a shock Tuesday. And it 
was unbelievable. I pick up things. I was walking

13:15.868 --> 13:22.098
down the hall at Southwood Valley Tuesday morning 
to go read to a class, and there's a dime laying on

13:15.868 --> 13:22.098
the floor. I picked it up, and I give it to the little 
boy who came to escort me to the class. I said,

13:26.725 --> 13:28.347
here's a dime for you. And then there was a nickel 
laying right there. So he said, oh, we're supposed

13:31.744 --> 13:33.627
to turn that in. So he went back to the office and 
turned that $0.15 in. And I was just dumbfounded.

13:43.302 --> 13:44.444
So I wouldn't have thought of doing it. If he hadn't 
been with me, I'd probably put it in my pocket. I

13:46.407 --> 13:47.689
never thought about turning it in. OK, I have then 
three questions left. first of those three is

13:53.032 --> 14:17.605
let's make believe that someone walks up to you 
tomorrow and hands you a check for one billion

13:53.032 --> 14:17.605
dollars with one condition you must pass it on to 
texas a m but you can decide the use of that money if

13:53.032 --> 14:17.605
you had a gift that you could make of that value what 
would you want it to be used for

14:23.153 --> 14:26.217
Dow scholarships for every student in the College 
of Veterinary Medicine.

14:29.120 --> 14:36.430
I don't

14:29.120 --> 14:36.430
know what the yield would be off of a million a year 
at 6% interest. That would be what, $60,000? And

14:37.651 --> 14:43.739
we've got about

14:37.651 --> 14:43.739
500 students. That would be a little better, 
$1,000 a student. Would you give one to every

14:48.605 --> 14:49.986
student? Yes. Okay, then the other two questions 
are, what has it meant to you to have been here for 35

14:53.056 --> 15:04.170
years? For my whole life. Things, so many that I 
would have never even thought of dreaming about in

15:08.135 --> 15:21.072
1935, 1940, 1945, that this could happen to me.

15:24.359 --> 15:29.504
It's just been an absolutely unbelievable 
experience. Alright, the last question. What

15:31.365 --> 15:36.910
feelings

15:31.365 --> 15:36.910
do you have in your heart for Texas A&M? This is a 
real difficult question for me because I share my

15:37.231 --> 15:45.078
feelings with Iowa State. I graduated from Iowa 
State and as I told you, I grew up in Iowa and I've

15:45.698 --> 15:52.845
never been able to get Iowa out of my mind. Iowa is my 
home. It's where my parents are buried. It's where

15:55.929 --> 15:57.471
I grew up, where I went to school. All my education 
up to master's level was at Iowa, in the state of

15:57.491 --> 16:02.520
Iowa. And I have a tremendous loyalty to Iowa 
State.

16:34.238 --> 16:51.053
muster speeches a couple of years ago that the 
thing I find most significant with Texas A&M, the

16:34.238 --> 16:51.053
students that come here to go to school, the 
majority came to get an education to enable them to

16:34.238 --> 16:51.053
pursue a career. They didn't come because of their 
any fraternity or sorority relationship, or

16:56.277 --> 17:11.554
because their dad had gone here, or this or that, 
they came on their own to achieve an academic

16:56.277 --> 17:11.554
degree that would let them pursue an honorable 
career. And that's what their goal is. And they do

17:14.197 --> 17:15.238
it.

17:19.522 --> 17:20.023
People... We hear this all the time from people 
from other institutions and other communities.

17:25.350 --> 17:29.015
They come here and they walk around on the campus. I 
know President Bush told me that he puts people up

17:29.516 --> 17:35.624
in the MSC quite frequently. And they go out and 
walk around on the campus. And they just can't

17:38.808 --> 17:42.513
believe what they're looking at. And that they 
just appear to be so

17:51.458 --> 17:56.777
oriented and goal-oriented in contrast to those 
who are just there on a lark. What feelings are in

17:58.282 --> 18:03.139
your heart about Texas A&E?

18:06.832 --> 18:19.446
Being here, and you were here through it at the same 
time, how it changed between 1965 and 1980 is just

18:06.832 --> 18:19.446
beyond comprehension. I was a part of it and didn't 
know I was a part of it. It was going on. And at that

18:27.795 --> 18:30.898
time, in the 70s, I was making
