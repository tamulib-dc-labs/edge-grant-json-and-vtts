WEBVTT

00:04.081 --> 00:10.667
I guess that he was a very practical guy.

00:11.828 --> 00:16.973
He'd had experience in the oil field, and that's why I thought quite a lot of him.

00:17.934 --> 00:26.902
And later, he went to work at a bank in Houston, and I would go down and visit him.

00:26.922 --> 00:30.746
And at one time, I had to borrow money from his bank.

00:30.766 --> 00:32.147
I had a real good relationship.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.015
When he quit the bank, he had a separate office.

00:35.176 --> 00:40.301
And I used to go by and visit with him whenever I'd go to Houston.

00:40.822 --> 00:45.246
In those days, we went to Houston quite a bit.

00:45.266 --> 00:45.466
All right.

00:45.486 --> 00:46.267
While you were a student?

00:46.728 --> 00:47.308
Oh, no.

00:47.328 --> 00:47.729
Oh, OK.

00:47.749 --> 00:48.890
Afterward.

00:48.910 --> 00:49.691
Oh, yeah.

00:49.711 --> 00:52.113
He taught several years after.

00:52.133 --> 01:00.582
In fact, he was there when the war ended because the whole group went back to A&M.

01:01.793 --> 01:05.378
after World War II when Eisenhower came.

01:05.398 --> 01:14.993
And I remember that I took Betty and we went up and visited with Harold.

01:15.013 --> 01:27.091
As you think now about the kind of instruction you received, was it theoretical or realistic in terms of what you encountered after you left the campus?

01:29.114 --> 01:31.277
Well, I think it was realistic.

01:32.101 --> 01:41.914
I always thought that the strength of A&M was some of the teachers that they had, and most of them had been there for some time.

01:43.736 --> 01:54.430
And, you know, a good question to anyone after they get out, ask them,

01:55.068 --> 01:59.594
What was their purpose in going to get a college education?

01:59.614 --> 02:00.535
Was it to make money?

02:00.975 --> 02:03.999
Was it to save the world, or what?

02:04.019 --> 02:10.127
And I suppose that I went, the hopes of getting a job in the other fields.

02:10.147 --> 02:13.632
And sure enough, it worked out.

02:13.792 --> 02:21.902
In class, what was the normal behavior pattern

02:22.507 --> 02:29.015
How did you, how often did you go to class and how did you behave and you and your colleagues in class?

02:29.516 --> 02:30.978
I think very good.

02:30.998 --> 02:32.059
Did you go regularly?

02:32.079 --> 02:32.499
Did you cut?

02:32.800 --> 02:33.220
No, no.

02:33.300 --> 02:37.345
Did you sleep in class?

02:38.347 --> 02:38.947
Probably.

02:40.029 --> 02:40.790
Not very much.

02:41.391 --> 02:44.474
No, there's one fellow that would throw chalk at you if you went to sleep.

02:44.514 --> 02:44.775
Who?

02:46.136 --> 02:49.020
That could have been Spencer.

02:57.151 --> 03:03.119
No, the only reason that you'd go to sleep if you didn't get enough sleep.

03:04.601 --> 03:08.165
The YMCA, was that an important center of activity?

03:08.225 --> 03:10.769
Yes, it was at the time that I was there.

03:11.269 --> 03:13.913
That's where they had the yell practice on the steps.

03:14.954 --> 03:19.320
And it was a real center of all activity.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.302
What was described?

03:21.382 --> 03:25.808
When you had someone visiting you because of a young lady,

03:26.159 --> 03:27.441
You'd usually go over there.

03:28.262 --> 03:30.525
And I believe that they had one place that served meals.

03:31.506 --> 03:33.489
And it was just a social place.

03:33.569 --> 03:35.692
And they actually had dances there.

03:35.852 --> 03:36.292
In the wine?

03:36.553 --> 03:38.435
I believe that's correct.

03:39.456 --> 03:40.858
That's smaller dances.

03:40.898 --> 03:44.083
The larger ones, they always had sublisa, class dances.

03:44.103 --> 03:45.544
All right, let's go to those dances.

03:46.165 --> 03:51.813
What were the important dance occasions when you were an undergraduate?

03:51.833 --> 03:53.895
Well, they had the freshman ball.

03:54.056 --> 03:55.137
I think that's softball.

03:56.011 --> 03:58.916
I've seen the ring dance.

03:58.936 --> 03:59.516
Boot dance.

04:03.403 --> 04:05.866
And where were they held?

04:08.931 --> 04:10.353
What orchestras performed?

04:10.874 --> 04:12.837
It was one from Brian.

04:14.159 --> 04:18.486
One of the fellas that was in the band.

04:19.067 --> 04:24.195
Over the years they had several real big, good orchestras.

04:25.120 --> 04:39.719
I think Tex Benneke was there, and I think there was some others that were.

04:39.739 --> 04:43.384
When you went to one of those dances, what did you students wear?

04:43.864 --> 04:45.346
Dress in uniform.

04:45.366 --> 04:46.447
What did a young lady wear?

04:47.689 --> 04:49.612
Even young.

04:49.772 --> 04:54.638
And how were those young women treated by the young men?

04:55.090 --> 04:59.675
You had a choice of, they set up the dormitory for them.

05:00.616 --> 05:11.788
Or some of the teachers or professors, family invited them to stay.

05:11.808 --> 05:15.933
And was the dance, was the behavior of the dance appropriate?

05:16.554 --> 05:16.794
Yes.

05:17.395 --> 05:21.519
There was very little drinking in the early days.

05:21.719 --> 05:24.102
There was one thing that they usually did.

05:25.921 --> 05:32.270
Not usually, but they had Bryan Country Club.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.593
And it stayed open longer.

05:35.454 --> 05:40.881
And the juniors and seniors usually would all go out there afterward.

05:40.901 --> 05:43.545
There was not too many freshmen or sophomores allowed.

05:44.886 --> 05:52.497
A lot of times they would, some of them that didn't have a date would try to pick up a date and then take her out there later.

05:53.158 --> 05:55.000
How did the young ladies get to

05:55.638 --> 05:57.260
College Station?

05:57.280 --> 06:02.887
The ones that I'm sure some of them came on the train, but most of them are parents of my brother.

06:02.907 --> 06:12.338
The only ones that I know, there was one date I had was from Houston, and about three or four girls drove it together in the car.

06:12.358 --> 06:12.758
That was my journey.

06:12.778 --> 06:15.221
That would have been a long trip in those days.

06:15.241 --> 06:17.945
No, that wasn't too bad.

06:17.965 --> 06:24.092
The, let's see, described Guyon Hall events.

06:25.102 --> 06:27.306
Well, they had most everything there.

06:27.887 --> 06:37.242
Any kind of gatherings that they wanted to do something to inform the students or something.

06:37.262 --> 06:42.090
And then I remember Jesse Jones made a speech there one time.

06:42.190 --> 06:47.679
They had a fellow named Law.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.963
A fellow from Houston named Law.

06:49.983 --> 06:51.666
I remember one time he gave a speech there.

06:52.186 --> 06:55.109
Do you remember some other famous visitors while you were a student?

06:55.649 --> 06:58.291
Well, Roosevelt came when I was there.

06:58.311 --> 07:02.075
Franklin D. Do you remember for what?

07:03.075 --> 07:05.598
Yeah, we had a review for him.

07:07.439 --> 07:16.207
And it could be that he was there maybe just before election or something.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.088
Did you get to see him?

07:17.348 --> 07:17.728
Oh, yeah.

07:17.748 --> 07:18.489
What was your impression?

07:18.509 --> 07:22.092
Well, actually, I saw him.

07:22.325 --> 07:29.032
from the parade ground to that he was in a reviewing stand.

07:29.052 --> 07:32.176
I had no idea that he was in a wheelchair.

07:32.436 --> 07:33.878
I mean, he was standing up.

07:35.019 --> 07:41.966
And I really didn't know until later that he wore braces.

07:41.986 --> 07:46.191
This was on the drill field or in the drill field?

07:46.431 --> 07:50.796
I think he went from the train

07:51.856 --> 07:53.198
to the drill field and back.

07:55.081 --> 08:02.253
If there was a famous visitor then who needed to spend the night, where did they stay?

08:02.754 --> 08:08.523
They had one place, they called it Aggieland Inn.

08:08.543 --> 08:09.184
It was pretty nice.

08:09.304 --> 08:11.428
Describe it, where it was and what it was like.

08:11.448 --> 08:13.611
It was just across from Sabisa Hall.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.603
About how many rooms do you have?

08:16.623 --> 08:17.865
Couldn't have been very many.

08:17.885 --> 08:19.186
Twenty?

08:20.268 --> 08:21.169
Let's see.

08:21.730 --> 08:26.756
In Guyon, were there ever any religious events?

08:31.202 --> 08:33.425
I don't remember any.

08:33.445 --> 08:38.692
There were a lot of churches in the area, and all of them were pretty active.

08:38.712 --> 08:41.256
Did students often go to church?

08:41.376 --> 08:41.556
Oh, yeah.

08:42.380 --> 08:44.963
Were they basically Protestant or Catholic or what?

08:45.143 --> 08:47.805
Well, it was mostly Protestant.

08:47.825 --> 08:51.869
There was a Jewish church there, and Catholic also.

08:51.889 --> 08:53.991
Were there any Jewish students that you knew?

08:54.132 --> 08:54.732
Yes.

08:54.752 --> 08:56.734
How were they treated?

08:56.754 --> 09:04.181
Well, I had one for a roommate for a while, and I think he was treated as well as anybody.

09:04.242 --> 09:05.323
There was only one out of them.

09:05.783 --> 09:07.044
What about Catholic students?

09:09.487 --> 09:10.868
I sure don't think that they were.

09:11.540 --> 09:17.388
I never heard of anything that happened as far as being Catholic.

09:18.269 --> 09:21.853
Were there any students from other countries, any international students?

09:21.873 --> 09:22.654
Not in court.

09:22.795 --> 09:27.340
There were some of those in separate quarters.

09:27.861 --> 09:32.107
And how were they treated, as far as you know, by everyone else?

09:32.127 --> 09:39.336
Well, you know, I remember they had some wooden buildings that were

09:40.463 --> 09:49.533
past Walton Hall and those fellows used to do a couple Indians and they were real.

09:50.694 --> 09:52.076
They would talk.

09:52.216 --> 09:56.240
We'd be out getting in line and we'd make comments back and forth.

09:56.260 --> 09:59.143
It was all very friendly and I mean the guy was nice.

10:00.485 --> 10:03.008
They would try to tease him and he'd tease them right back.

10:03.688 --> 10:05.290
So it was just a teasing thing.

10:05.405 --> 10:08.970
Now, I had to be in the Corps of Cadets the first two years.

10:09.050 --> 10:10.973
Could I drop out after two years?

10:10.993 --> 10:12.576
Yes.

10:12.596 --> 10:16.982
And what were those people called or was there a nickname for those who dropped out?

10:18.044 --> 10:21.469
Oh, I see that.

10:21.489 --> 10:31.564
When I was there, very few dropped out because of the pay and the clothing allowance and then the chance to go to camp.

10:32.658 --> 10:34.300
Let me see if I can think of anything.

10:34.380 --> 10:38.844
I'm sure that's changed and maybe they got a name, but I don't think we had a name.

10:39.685 --> 10:41.066
Did many people frog in?

10:41.947 --> 10:42.248
Yes.

10:44.690 --> 10:48.614
I'd say in our company we had maybe one or two.

10:49.415 --> 10:52.758
Did they get teased about being frogs?

10:52.778 --> 10:53.038
Not too much.

10:53.058 --> 10:56.041
They sure called frogs.

10:57.142 --> 10:59.745
In terms of student opinion,

11:00.164 --> 11:03.787
What were the easiest and most demanding majors?

11:06.389 --> 11:06.950
Chemistry.

11:07.470 --> 11:09.852
Those were the... Physics.

11:09.872 --> 11:10.953
Those were the most demanding.

11:11.073 --> 11:11.954
Electrical engineer.

11:12.374 --> 11:12.715
All right.

11:12.735 --> 11:15.337
Electrical.

11:15.357 --> 11:17.218
And chemical, I think, were the most difficult.

11:17.238 --> 11:18.419
What were supposedly the easiest?

11:21.102 --> 11:24.384
Probably some of the agricultural courses.

11:28.868 --> 11:29.749
They didn't have...

11:30.100 --> 11:37.808
Did y'all have nicknames for some of the majors?

11:37.828 --> 11:55.004
Yeah, actually they had nicknames for the different units, the core units, the artillery, the coast artillery, they call them buzzard busters.

11:55.024 --> 11:57.627
Buzzard busters.

11:59.125 --> 12:15.127
engineers, crapper builders, and the, I believe the chemical engineers were the stink bombers, and the cavalry was horse jocks or something like that, and infantry was paddle feet.

12:15.147 --> 12:15.928
Paddle feet.

12:15.948 --> 12:17.350
Paddle feet.

12:17.490 --> 12:18.231
Signal Corps.

12:19.813 --> 12:26.702
Let's see what they call those guys.

12:26.722 --> 12:28.845
And y'all didn't, you had nothing that

12:29.348 --> 12:32.052
was anywhere close to being armor yet?

12:32.893 --> 12:36.819
Everything was horse-mouthed.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.401
Let's see, you mentioned Coast Artillery.

12:38.421 --> 12:39.543
What about Field Artillery?

12:39.563 --> 12:41.927
Did they have a nickname?

12:48.516 --> 12:55.106
Let's see, DeWare Fieldhouse was the indoor sports building.

12:55.206 --> 12:57.229
What did you all do at DeWare?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.360
That's where you had all of the P.E.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.423
classes.

13:01.443 --> 13:07.833
And that's where you met with Penworthy to get indoctrinated or whatever, and then you'd go to different things.

13:08.173 --> 13:11.598
They played the basketball games there.

13:12.339 --> 13:20.752
And I'm not sure whether they had their intramural boxing hat at some point.

13:20.772 --> 13:22.795
Their intramural wrestling boxing hat.

13:24.428 --> 13:28.152
Was every student expected to be involved in intramurals?

13:28.172 --> 13:32.776
Yes, the upperclassmen encouraged me.

13:32.796 --> 13:34.197
And it was a good thing.

13:35.298 --> 13:36.660
You had competition with the other.

13:37.120 --> 13:41.204
What were your favorite intramural activities?

13:44.027 --> 13:46.049
I guess touch football.

13:46.069 --> 13:48.791
Did you have a least favorite?

13:48.811 --> 13:48.871
No.

13:48.891 --> 13:52.815
Were there any... You had a choice of...

13:53.335 --> 13:59.186
I never did go out for boxing or wrestling.

14:00.368 --> 14:02.973
I think I went out for rifle shooting.

14:06.820 --> 14:13.673
Were there any intramural activities that were entirely new to your experience?

14:14.598 --> 14:16.680
There's nothing like field hockey or something.

14:16.760 --> 14:20.984
Well, there's a tribe across or anything else.

14:21.004 --> 14:29.051
Describe for me, please, in as much detail as you can, a football weekend during your student days.

14:30.252 --> 14:34.796
When did the activities begin, and what all did it include, and how long did it last?

14:35.577 --> 14:39.080
Most of them then were in the afternoons.

14:39.941 --> 14:42.183
But was there anything on Friday before the game?

14:42.443 --> 14:44.385
Well, they always had

14:45.749 --> 14:46.590
Yale practice.

14:48.392 --> 14:53.499
Midnight Yale practice the day before.

14:53.519 --> 14:53.679
Where?

14:53.699 --> 14:57.283
In front of the fly.

14:58.004 --> 14:59.506
What happened at Yale practice?

15:00.988 --> 15:11.881
I remember one, my freshman year, that TCU had a real strong team.

15:11.901 --> 15:14.845
And the two senior cheerleaders,

15:16.276 --> 15:22.802
They started out by playing the TCU song, and then they just had about everybody crying.

15:22.862 --> 15:38.238
And I'd say that those tied the whole core together probably as much as anything, because everybody went, and everybody liked it.

15:38.258 --> 15:43.743
Freshmen had to be up in front, sophomores back, and then senior thing.

15:43.763 --> 15:44.764
Same way in the seating.

15:45.453 --> 15:54.961
All right, at midnight yell practice, was there anything that went on out there in the darkness that... No, I'd say this.

15:55.021 --> 15:59.105
The only thing I remember about it, the band would get out and march somewhere.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.787
We didn't meet down at the field at that time.

16:01.807 --> 16:10.835
All right, then on Saturdays, Saturday morning was not organized.

16:10.895 --> 16:12.336
Could you sleep in on Saturday morning?

16:12.416 --> 16:12.557
No.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.278
Let me see if I'm

16:14.748 --> 16:22.376
It's possible that we had to march in.

16:24.118 --> 16:26.941
So we went to breakfast and got ready to march in.

16:28.062 --> 16:29.163
Pretty sure that's right.

16:29.183 --> 16:30.745
Was there, and there was a review?

16:31.746 --> 16:33.188
Yes, there was everyone.

16:33.408 --> 16:35.931
Do you remember any famous reviewing officers?

16:37.953 --> 16:43.759
No, that was before the wars, and I don't believe there was any.

16:45.562 --> 16:49.786
It seemed like if you had a date that you could be excused from the march in.

16:52.309 --> 16:56.113
And during the game did you all sit or stand?

16:56.133 --> 16:57.334
I stood the whole time.

16:57.635 --> 17:00.638
Did dates get kissed after scores?

17:00.718 --> 17:04.502
I think they started that after I was there.

17:04.682 --> 17:06.624
Did people talk about the 12th man then?

17:07.345 --> 17:09.026
Not none of it.

17:09.046 --> 17:15.433
Well actually we knew, we actually talked more about his name than

17:16.949 --> 17:19.231
I mean, everyone repeated that.

17:19.752 --> 17:28.461
At least, the night before the game, the coach would always be there too.

17:30.263 --> 17:31.023
Who was the coach?

17:32.365 --> 17:32.905
Homer Norton.

17:33.666 --> 17:34.627
Please describe him.

17:36.008 --> 17:44.357
Well, he was a, I'd say he was kind of a sentimental fellow.

17:44.708 --> 17:50.974
He'd won quite a few games.

17:51.034 --> 17:55.039
He would always give a real stirring talk.

17:58.022 --> 17:58.662
Pleasant?

17:58.902 --> 18:03.087
Oh yes, I mean emotional.

18:03.107 --> 18:05.229
He would play and fight.

18:05.249 --> 18:08.933
Who were the football stars during your days?

18:11.455 --> 18:14.158
Joe Rout was there when I was there.

18:15.067 --> 18:21.013
In fact, Dick Todd came this sophomore year.

18:21.033 --> 18:34.907
That was one reason that I went back, for sure, because I really got indoctrinated with the football just because of the way they did everything with the golf practice and so forth, the enthusiasm.

18:34.927 --> 18:41.674
And when I first went home, I told my dad I didn't know whether I was too pinched about going back or not.

18:41.894 --> 18:44.517
This was at the end of your first year?

18:45.779 --> 18:52.407
And then I read in the paper that A&M had recruited Dick Todd.

18:52.427 --> 18:54.689
Cool slash.

18:54.709 --> 18:57.372
And I took a picture of him when he got off the train.

18:57.392 --> 19:00.376
Did you recognize that picture?

19:00.396 --> 19:05.001
My memory begins of A&M football with reading about Dick Todd.

19:06.262 --> 19:06.763
Let's see.

19:08.044 --> 19:13.431
Now, Kimbrough and that group, were they there as freshmen their senior year?

19:13.451 --> 19:13.871
Let's see.

19:13.951 --> 19:15.533
I'm fairly sure.

19:16.306 --> 19:19.090
I saw Kimbrough play his first game.

19:19.430 --> 19:22.735
He went into the Baylor game at Waco.

19:24.057 --> 19:27.021
And that's when he, they just couldn't stop him.

19:28.323 --> 19:29.865
It was about the second or third game.

19:30.766 --> 19:31.467
It was a long while.

19:31.507 --> 19:32.949
I guess it was his sophomore year.

19:33.189 --> 19:35.733
Freshman went and played.

19:35.853 --> 19:39.558
Do you have some football memories that are very keen?

19:39.638 --> 19:42.682
Some games that you remember particularly, plus or minus?

19:43.884 --> 19:44.625
I'd say the most

19:46.732 --> 19:54.481
In my sophomore year, Sammy Ball was a coach, quarterback for TCU.

19:54.521 --> 20:00.508
TCU had the winning team, but A&M beat him at that college station that year.

20:00.708 --> 20:03.992
He was kind of crippled.

20:04.052 --> 20:07.637
A&M had a freshman named Roy Young.

20:07.657 --> 20:08.598
Do you ever remember him?

20:08.618 --> 20:12.122
He was from the guy in Beaumont somewhere.

20:12.202 --> 20:14.865
Big guy.

20:15.419 --> 20:18.383
I got fairly well acquainted with him.

20:19.725 --> 20:26.055
A football player stayed in one end of Walton Hall, down on the east end.

20:26.075 --> 20:35.548
And one time I volunteered to help teach, and that was a disaster.

20:35.569 --> 20:39.334
There'd be several guys in there.

20:39.787 --> 20:40.688
They just came in.

20:40.728 --> 20:43.891
Nothing was organized by the coaches or anything.

20:44.231 --> 20:46.193
I don't remember exactly how it got started then.

20:47.093 --> 20:53.059
But I would try to do something and one of the guys would lean back in their chairs and one would push the other one over.

20:54.300 --> 20:57.883
And so it didn't work out too well.

20:59.024 --> 21:01.426
Now, as far as you know, did the athletes go to class?

21:04.488 --> 21:05.449
Yes, fairly well.

21:05.469 --> 21:08.612
I mean, they had to be in the Corps.

21:09.875 --> 21:15.644
They were excused probably more than other students.

21:15.664 --> 21:18.848
Was there any major that all the athletes were stuck in?

21:18.888 --> 21:21.192
I have no idea.

21:21.452 --> 21:32.869
I don't think they had a physical education classification of things that they do now.

21:32.889 --> 21:36.134
Were there any Texas games that were particularly dear in your memory?

21:37.396 --> 21:38.397
Probably a lot of them.

21:42.106 --> 21:45.269
Anything happen at any of those that stand zone?

21:45.469 --> 21:57.322
Well, one was... Let's see.

21:58.763 --> 22:01.165
Band.

22:01.446 --> 22:01.966
Aggie Band?

22:01.986 --> 22:03.167
Tell me about the Aggie Band.

22:03.288 --> 22:06.451
Well, everybody thought that was the best band ever.

22:06.651 --> 22:10.715
Everybody respected the band.

22:10.735 --> 22:11.556
It was a big essay.

22:11.570 --> 22:13.472
Describe what the band did.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.896
Well, they just marched.

22:17.396 --> 22:18.497
At what kinds of activities?

22:18.798 --> 22:20.940
Well, just at the football games.

22:20.960 --> 22:33.733
Of course, they, of course, in all of the parades, what do you call it, on the drill field, they led the deal.

22:34.053 --> 22:37.837
Also, they went to meals every day.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.480
Yeah, so they were well thought of.

22:41.675 --> 22:53.555
No, the thing I was thinking about was Texas students and the SMU students always, every time they'd see us with uniforms, they'd say, poor old farmers.

22:55.979 --> 22:58.063
Did you all say anything back to them?

22:58.083 --> 22:58.724
Well, one time.

23:01.048 --> 23:02.951
Then my brother, young brother, got into it.

23:04.213 --> 23:05.235
Let's see.

23:06.481 --> 23:12.070
What about, describe final review for me in your days.

23:12.751 --> 23:14.794
Where was it held?

23:15.054 --> 23:16.096
It was on the drill field.

23:18.039 --> 23:22.766
They'd go around once with the seniors leading, if I remember correctly.

23:24.749 --> 23:30.618
And then they would let the juniors take over.

23:30.638 --> 23:33.923
And I think maybe we went around again.

23:35.776 --> 23:36.998
with the juniors leading.

23:37.538 --> 23:45.288
I'm fairly sure that they hadn't appointed all of the officers for the next year.

23:45.308 --> 23:47.511
I believe they did by companies.

23:48.272 --> 23:51.676
But anyhow, and then they went back by companies.

23:52.297 --> 23:57.984
The whole company got together and started telling everybody goodbye.

23:59.486 --> 24:03.170
Where'd you get your senior boots?

24:03.450 --> 24:05.513
In Houston.

24:07.400 --> 24:14.486
I actually got a discount on my boots.

24:16.048 --> 24:18.690
I went to a bootmaker in Houston.

24:18.710 --> 24:23.455
He said if I would sell another pair or two, he'd give me a discount.

24:23.575 --> 24:25.556
But I did sell, I think, one more pair.

24:25.677 --> 24:26.778
Do you remember what they cost?

24:27.638 --> 24:28.900
I have no idea.

24:30.541 --> 24:33.364
Let's say $30, $40 maybe.

24:33.844 --> 24:34.805
I have no idea.

24:35.245 --> 24:37.187
Was it normal then?

24:37.522 --> 24:42.830
to get a new pair of boots, or did the average student get a pair of hand-me-downs?

24:42.850 --> 24:49.140
At that time, there wasn't too many hand-me-downs.

24:50.862 --> 24:55.009
I think I might have given my boots to my younger brother.

24:55.209 --> 24:58.134
I had one brother's below me.

24:58.154 --> 25:00.878
I know I didn't keep them.

25:01.859 --> 25:05.605
Can you describe for me commencement in your days?

25:06.985 --> 25:08.487
Particularly your commencement.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.448
Where was it held?

25:09.668 --> 25:10.469
Who spoke?

25:12.111 --> 25:17.798
I did not go to the commencement.

25:17.818 --> 25:18.459
Why?

25:18.479 --> 25:19.660
I've never been to one.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.001
Really?

25:21.262 --> 25:23.265
Was that common not to go to commencement then?

25:23.765 --> 25:28.491
Well, actually, I've only been to two.

25:29.272 --> 25:30.694
I was eligible for two.

25:31.775 --> 25:36.621
At A&M, I liked about four hours of graduating, something like that.

25:37.090 --> 25:47.661
So I went back the next summer, half a term, I think, and then they sent me the diploma at OU.

25:49.222 --> 25:56.009
I had a job offer, and they wanted me there before the commencement, so I didn't go.

25:57.170 --> 26:00.233
The only commencement I've been to is when I was president of the Association.

26:00.253 --> 26:01.695
The president of the Association, okay.

26:02.095 --> 26:05.699
Did you attend commencement as a junior or a sophomore?

26:05.979 --> 26:06.760
Where was it held?

26:09.777 --> 26:14.002
I think I know, but I don't believe it.

26:14.062 --> 26:15.864
It could have been a G. Wiley.

26:16.465 --> 26:18.787
Well, no, G. Wiley wouldn't have been finished.

26:18.807 --> 26:19.108
It wouldn't be.

26:19.128 --> 26:25.575
Was it normal in that era, as far as you know, for each graduating student to attend as it is now?

26:27.217 --> 26:28.979
I don't think so.

26:28.999 --> 26:34.165
Well, now, I can't answer that because I didn't graduate at the same time in class.

26:34.853 --> 26:40.358
All right, now I've heard that there were some secret fraternities once upon a time at A&M.

26:41.499 --> 26:43.460
Is there any information you can share about?

26:43.480 --> 26:44.121
It's just rumors.

26:44.741 --> 26:46.883
All right, what were supposedly the rumors?

26:47.204 --> 26:50.566
Well, I never did believe them.

26:50.586 --> 26:55.671
Maybe that's naive, but they have what they call TT, True Texans.

26:55.691 --> 26:58.693
They'll have any idea.

26:58.713 --> 27:04.118
And I'd say that maybe before that I was there,

27:04.942 --> 27:08.926
It might have been something, maybe.

27:08.946 --> 27:12.349
According to the rumors, what did the TTs do?

27:12.990 --> 27:14.351
Nothing.

27:14.371 --> 27:16.474
I really don't know.

27:16.494 --> 27:17.795
In fact, I doubted it.

27:18.175 --> 27:20.137
I've heard also mention of the stickers.

27:20.818 --> 27:21.639
Stickers.

27:21.659 --> 27:22.419
Swastikers.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.203
Never heard of them.

27:26.223 --> 27:32.990
And I've been told that the letters TT may have stood for Tonkawa tribe.

27:33.090 --> 27:34.932
Only one person has mentioned that.

27:35.536 --> 27:37.198
They called it True Texas.

27:37.218 --> 27:37.458
OK.

27:38.079 --> 27:41.002
And you don't know whether they really existed in your day or not?

27:41.022 --> 27:43.185
No.

27:43.706 --> 27:48.772
They were talked about just about like they're talking about Slick Willie now.

27:49.212 --> 27:55.860
The project houses for, tell me about those, where they were, and who lived there, and what did they?

27:57.422 --> 27:57.842
Well, let's see.

27:57.862 --> 27:59.804
This fellow, Russell, started those.

27:59.824 --> 28:01.506
Heard it, Dan Russell.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.969
Real nice guy.

28:03.989 --> 28:05.391
Well, they were across the railroad.

28:06.113 --> 28:11.080
And I don't believe that I was ever over there.

28:11.100 --> 28:17.388
I knew one of the fellows that was working this island where he worked for one year.

28:18.610 --> 28:20.252
And he worked there.

28:20.773 --> 28:24.998
He was in the same class that I was in.

28:25.018 --> 28:28.683
And he lived in one of those houses and he would tell us about it.

28:29.284 --> 28:34.150
They brought in their food and things like that to cheapen their cost.

28:34.171 --> 28:35.673
Now were they in the Corps?

28:35.693 --> 28:36.053
Yes.

28:36.455 --> 28:39.619
And who built those houses?

28:40.860 --> 28:48.109
I imagine that Dan Russell moved into a whole bunch of junk houses or something and put them together.

28:48.229 --> 28:51.973
As I understand it, various counties and towns paid for it.

28:52.294 --> 28:55.197
So that their youngsters could... That's possible.

28:56.118 --> 28:57.259
I don't know why.

28:57.279 --> 29:06.310
I guess I was lucky that I didn't have to... When you traveled around from College Station,

29:07.268 --> 29:11.712
How did you get to other towns, if you were going home or going somewhere?

29:11.732 --> 29:20.781
Actually, if we went to say a core trip to go by train, we made two a year.

29:21.342 --> 29:22.102
Describe those.

29:22.843 --> 29:29.509
Well, if you'd all go by companies down to get on the train.

29:29.529 --> 29:29.810
Where?

29:31.231 --> 29:32.532
Fort Worth.

29:32.652 --> 29:35.335
No, where would you get on?

29:36.412 --> 29:39.196
plane, the train would be parked there by the depot.

29:40.457 --> 29:55.156
And we headed in the direction, whether he was going to Houston or Dallas or, let's see, I definitely remember marching in Fort Worth, Houston twice, and possibly to Dallas once.

29:55.177 --> 29:55.877
And Austin?

29:57.339 --> 30:02.847
Yeah, it's, let me see now.

30:02.867 --> 30:03.988
Houston or Austin?

30:04.458 --> 30:07.001
one year and Dallas or Fort Worth one year, wouldn't it?

30:08.023 --> 30:08.784
That's the case.

30:10.126 --> 30:12.369
Yes, I remember marching here.

30:13.971 --> 30:15.553
So you went on the train.

30:15.894 --> 30:19.419
Were there any fun activities you all did on the train?

30:20.981 --> 30:21.341
Bad.

30:21.782 --> 30:23.104
Such as?

30:23.124 --> 30:27.430
They would take rolls of toilet paper and the train stopped or something.

30:27.450 --> 30:31.555
They'd throw it out and decorate the fences and the trees.

30:32.336 --> 30:33.638
That's about all.

30:34.158 --> 30:38.183
All right, when you got, you normally went on a Friday?

30:39.966 --> 30:41.287
Yes, we'd go.

30:47.936 --> 30:51.320
It seemed like we'd get directly off the train.

30:51.721 --> 30:52.402
And go much?

30:52.422 --> 30:53.103
In Houston.

30:54.064 --> 30:55.806
Oh, so you'd go early Saturday morning?

30:55.826 --> 30:57.749
Yeah, easily.

30:57.829 --> 30:58.670
Maybe even Fort Worth.

30:59.711 --> 31:01.954
They'd get you up early there if you need to go somewhere.

31:02.525 --> 31:08.173
And so then, when did you come back to College State?

31:08.193 --> 31:10.797
Everybody was on their own to come back.

31:10.837 --> 31:19.249
Sometimes, I don't know, I don't ever remember coming back on the train.

31:19.849 --> 31:21.091
How did you get back then?

31:21.111 --> 31:25.618
Well, someone would have access to a car or maybe their family.

31:26.579 --> 31:29.443
Normally, I'd just like to say Fort Worth.

31:31.111 --> 31:37.181
I stayed with one of the friends, a freshman.

31:37.201 --> 31:38.823
We stayed all night at his house.

31:40.606 --> 31:43.430
Slept on the floor.

31:43.450 --> 31:46.916
And I'd say maybe one of his brothers drove us back.

31:47.136 --> 31:48.779
I'm pretty sure he drove us back.

31:49.720 --> 31:53.266
Did you all ever have dates on those out of town court trips?

31:53.326 --> 31:53.446
Yes.

31:53.486 --> 31:56.511
How did you get a date on those out of town?
