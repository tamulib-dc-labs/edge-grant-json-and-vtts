WEBVTT

01:35.645 --> 01:40.170
I believe that the word that you used was 
interrelating these ideas. Would you just say a

01:40.450 --> 01:43.073
few words about that, please? Right. Well, for 
example, if we look at aspects of the marine

01:44.495 --> 02:04.538
environment, take this thing I'm thinking about 
right now, ocean disposal of dredged material, we

01:44.495 --> 02:04.538
can analyze the water column for the metals 
contained as normal background and then look at it

01:44.495 --> 02:04.538
from the standpoint of the metals being 
introduced, which could be toxic to marine

02:05.007 --> 02:09.933
organisms. And we can then look at the nature of the 
water itself and the effect it's having on these

02:10.954 --> 02:19.464
metals, oxidizing them. Do they become more or 
less stable? And we can take all of the pieces apart

02:22.488 --> 02:32.820
and enumerate these. But it isn't until we attempt 
to say what does this all mean and try to put it

02:33.998 --> 02:45.853
together into a working system that we really feel 
we're achieving anything today. And this is what I

02:45.893 --> 02:47.495
call synthesis.

02:50.960 --> 02:56.327
OK. Another question I have is with reference to 
your discussion of the potential of the ocean. Is

02:57.648 --> 03:01.373
the biological potential of the ocean really as 
low as you say? For instance, as you say, it's an

03:02.720 --> 03:07.245
auxiliary spinoff from the land. Is our ocean 
technology advanced enough yet really to

03:08.247 --> 03:14.974
accurately predict the future of the marine food 
production in the future? Take, for example, the

03:16.396 --> 03:21.182
lush production that we have in parts of Israel 
once we had a desert. In other words, are we at a

03:21.202 --> 03:25.927
stage where we can really say what the potential 
will be? And so when you're talking about the

03:26.728 --> 03:32.355
potential of the ocean being low, are you talking 
about long range or in the short range? Well, for

03:32.892 --> 03:37.218
example, I'm talking about long range, I think. 
I'm talking about the ultimate. That's my

03:38.921 --> 03:39.902
opinion. Now, it is an opinion. It's certainly not 
a fact. But if you want to take the time yourself to

03:45.250 --> 03:59.170
look at an analysis of mid-Pacific water and try to 
decide what nutrients are there and what could be

03:45.250 --> 03:59.170
sustained by those nutrients, knowing what the 
relationship is between phosphate say and the

03:59.622 --> 04:25.242
amount of material you can build of an organism and 
if you've got something on the way of exchange

03:59.622 --> 04:25.242
rates for this material from the deeper water i 
think you can calculate what it could produce and

03:59.622 --> 04:25.242
it turns out it's not as much as you might want to 
think now

04:27.871 --> 04:36.723
I'll admit, there is a giant mid-Pacific gyre 
where this slow-moving stuff is going around. And

04:36.743 --> 04:40.729
probably not as much exchange as we'd like to 
believe. But it is for reasons of this type, taking

04:41.410 --> 04:51.904
that nature is an omniscient object, kind of not 
only innovator but operator in a sense it's an

04:53.183 --> 05:22.363
opportunist it takes advantage of what is there to 
build more I think this is the whole basis for

04:53.183 --> 05:22.363
evolution as a matter of fact progressive 
evolution I think the only way you can define it is

04:53.183 --> 05:22.363
organisms that have found a way to utilize matter 
and energy that hasn't been utilized up to then And

05:23.963 --> 05:35.874
as a consequence, I think that the same is true 
here, that you would expect if nature could do it,

05:23.963 --> 05:35.874
it would have done it by now. And it's not producing 
very much there. Now, that is what I'm basing it on.

05:43.602 --> 05:52.570
It may be awfully shaky ground, but I simply feel 
that it's just not advisable to hold out this hope

05:52.870 --> 06:07.329
to people that there is going to be a millennium 
when we can harvest the sea effectively. I can't

06:08.230 --> 06:10.213
see how you wall it off. And I can see you could do it. 
But Lord, the output of energy and materials would

06:13.477 --> 06:19.705
be so great that the return would be meaningless. I 
think the land is still the place. Oh, I'd love to

06:24.268 --> 06:27.413
think it could do more. And indeed, it can do more. 
But I do not believe for its area that it will ever

06:29.876 --> 06:42.935
produce as effectively as the land.

06:49.244 --> 06:49.304
OK. Thank you. I'd like to go on to a different topic 
now. In terms of systematics, what is your opinion

06:54.773 --> 07:12.991
of the new definition of families, genera, and 
species which are evolving based on mathematical

06:54.773 --> 07:12.991
indices such as the percent similarity index and 
these kinds of indices as opposed to the classical

06:54.773 --> 07:12.991
morphological approach to systematics?

07:15.754 --> 07:16.134
All right. I consider these to systematics about 
as I would the microscope to optics.

07:28.940 --> 07:34.848
All these things do is extend one's penetration 
into the subject. But it still leaves judgment as

07:36.430 --> 07:43.941
the basis for decision making. And I do not believe 
that you can find a mathematical or numerical

07:50.135 --> 07:56.023
system that will ever replace it. Now, I believe 
these are important tools, and I believe they give

07:57.786 --> 08:04.035
us insights. But, for example, I was examining 
about 400 species of organisms living on the

08:05.417 --> 08:17.053
continental slope.

08:17.303 --> 08:34.645
trying to look at their distributions, ordering 
their distributions vertically,

08:17.303 --> 08:34.645
bathymetrically, so to speak, and determining 
whether or not they actually were sort of living in

08:17.303 --> 08:34.645
assemblages or communities, in the very loose 
sense of the term. And I came up with certain

08:35.786 --> 08:38.870
clusters. Now, there are statistical methods for 
finding these clusters, and we didn't vary at all.

08:47.999 --> 08:53.865
If it's set up, it saves a lot of time to go through 
the statistical approach. And it's very nice as a

08:54.646 --> 08:58.090
corroboration verification. But I think you 
still have to have the judgment, because it's

08:58.831 --> 09:06.759
man's mind that made the system in the first place.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.445
Sure, I believe these are good tools. But just as 
the microscope extends your vision into this

09:12.465 --> 09:17.871
subject, and permits your senses to probe a little 
more deeply into it. So these systems permit you to

09:23.354 --> 09:30.220
grasp, perhaps, relationships you didn't see as 
easily. But I still think you have to make up the

09:30.240 --> 09:36.306
mind as to what the decision will be after you do it. 
Is it a new species or not? What percentage

09:38.468 --> 09:41.130
similarity should there be? What should the ratio 
be to be significant? Arbitrarily, there would be

09:46.215 --> 09:48.617
an assumption It's got to be over 50% or 30% is 
enough, okay? I think this is true. Now, certainly

09:55.003 --> 10:08.035
I think, though, that there's some splendid 
statistical treatments today for ecological

09:55.003 --> 10:08.035
science. And we are using those very extensively 
in my work with the myofuna. And I think that it's

10:14.281 --> 10:18.705
there that

10:21.790 --> 10:35.127
Some people, now certainly there are not many, but 
some people get the idea that cause and effect can

10:21.790 --> 10:35.127
be approached through statistics. It can, but it 
can't prove it,

10:35.688 --> 10:41.796
that there is a cause and effect. You can get a high 
correlation between this and this, and you'd like

10:41.856 --> 10:47.764
to think, God, this causes this, But that 
statistics never tells you that. You've still got

10:50.946 --> 10:54.128
to make up your own mind, is it or not. And some of 
it's just plain garbage, you know, when you come

10:54.148 --> 10:56.951
out of it. You know it's garbage that the computer 
has given you. It says, hey, look, you've got a

11:00.574 --> 11:03.457
beautiful relationship here. But that's all it 
is, just a relationship. There's no causation

11:08.341 --> 11:10.723
involved. It took me a little time to think of that. 
I figured out that... Boy, you just fall right into

11:18.085 --> 11:22.130
that trap, though. So human judgment is the 
ultimate... I think so. It's a magnificent thing.

11:27.056 --> 11:34.866
I

11:27.056 --> 11:34.866
wish politicians used

11:27.056 --> 11:34.866
it more. We'd like for you to evaluate for us what 
you consider the significance of the work you've

11:36.748 --> 11:44.498
done in the field of family organisms. Fouling 
organism? Oh. Well, I'll tell you. I'll take an

11:53.071 --> 11:56.916
approach to that that's unorthodox.

12:00.381 --> 12:07.110
The only thing we did was an ad hoc study, or ad hoc if 
you want,

12:12.220 --> 12:16.326
of fouling in one area of the Gulf of Mexico. And we 
did it because of the need for the Navy to know at the

12:16.346 --> 12:34.732
time what kinds and how many following organisms 
would develop on various pieces of equipment they

12:16.346 --> 12:34.732
might wish to put out into the ocean and how long it 
would take before they were fouled up. And so we did

12:35.052 --> 12:36.795
that. And we came up with some answers. which 
seemed to be satisfactory, and they needed to know

12:41.802 --> 13:01.569
whether one particular antifoulant, which was 
relatively new then, which was an organotin

12:41.802 --> 13:01.569
compound, whether or not this would work to 
protect the devices where fouling would be a major

12:41.802 --> 13:01.569
problem. Okay. Now, however, as a result of that 
study, I think, although... It is not as well

13:13.375 --> 13:16.139
received. The important thing was how much 
fouling organisms, so-called, can tell us about

13:17.861 --> 13:28.735
the marine environment. And the reason we call 
them fouling organisms is because they are

13:30.077 --> 13:42.133
growing on surfaces that man doesn't want them to 
grow on. artificial surfaces, ships, docks,

13:42.518 --> 13:47.384
buoys. It's like dirt. A flower and a cake is 
magnificent, but on the floor it's dirt. And the

13:55.093 --> 13:57.596
same is true of the following organism. Now, I 
became convinced that these were magnificent

14:00.019 --> 14:06.146
current meters. They were magnificent markers of 
of water masses, and that they could tell us a great

14:12.202 --> 14:19.713
deal about the movement of water.

14:22.857 --> 14:42.124
Because

14:22.857 --> 14:42.124
if you put something out for these pelagic larvae 
of these organisms to settle on as they're being

14:22.857 --> 14:42.124
carried by the water, if

14:22.857 --> 14:42.124
one settles on this piece of stuff you've got out 
there, and you see it there, and you know that it

14:42.880 --> 14:55.016
only exists in a certain water mass, then you can 
demonstrate that water mass was there.

14:58.600 --> 15:12.398
However, to go out and sample it with temperature 
and salinity probes to determine the water mass

14:58.600 --> 15:12.398
would take thousands of dollars and many hours of 
time to watch. So I figured here was a nice little

15:13.188 --> 15:24.283
cheap way of learning an immense amount about the 
marine environment. For example, if you had, say,

15:24.323 --> 15:32.153
this is Yucatan, and you're coming up north, the 
loop current and so on. And this is the Yucatan

15:32.173 --> 15:38.301
Peninsula, and this is Cuba over here, and Florida 
coming down over here. If you know that an organism

15:39.277 --> 16:05.261
as adults only lives here and it's producing 
larvae and they come in here, and if you have a

15:39.277 --> 16:05.261
device up here on which they can settle and nothing 
in between they can settle on, then you can not only

15:39.277 --> 16:05.261
determine that the larvae are being carried this 
far, but you can also determine something about

15:39.277 --> 16:05.261
their life cycle and a lot of other intellectual 
things. So I think that's important to me. We'll

16:09.027 --> 16:20.684
get around to convincing more people, but I never 
did go on with it because we got involved in deep sea

16:09.027 --> 16:20.684
work and I couldn't go on. So, the significance? 
Well, just an ad hoc thing for the Navy on that one

16:24.269 --> 16:31.300
thing, but I think that the use of these organisms 
is important. Now, let me say this, that a fellow by

16:31.360 --> 16:38.190
the name of Shaltima at Woods Hole has done an 
immense amount with the transport of pelagic

16:38.693 --> 16:44.099
larvae across the entire Atlantic Ocean. And we 
now know that there is the potential for larvae

16:45.541 --> 16:58.555
produced in Europe to be transported in the north 
equatorial current across to the Americas.

17:01.238 --> 17:05.983
I don't know if they can get through to the shore, 
but they're out there, not very far away.

17:09.001 --> 17:23.287
What do you think of the concept of bringing the sea 
to the land, that is, the development of marine

17:09.001 --> 17:23.287
organisms in artificial environments of land, if 
you should like, like Spillhouse's concept of

17:09.001 --> 17:23.287
inland dream cities? Well, I think this is a real 
promising thing, and I think it's starting right

17:24.369 --> 17:30.760
now in West Texas. You know, there are salt domes. 
in West Texas, and I think this looks like an

17:33.807 --> 17:41.658
interesting development to me to try to raise 
shrimp out in West Texas around Van Horn. That'd be

17:41.698 --> 17:42.940
kind of fascinating. Sure, I think this is real, 
and I think it's a good possibility. Could this

17:49.650 --> 17:56.159
possibly be then one of the keys of ocean success to 
population expansion in the future? Well, I think

17:56.840 --> 17:58.903
it's... it's a move in that direction. The 
difficulty is that most of the things we, we want to

18:01.146 --> 18:18.970
culture, uh, almost, uh, end up in the gourmet food 
category, you know, and I don't think that's going

18:01.146 --> 18:18.970
to feed the world, but I'm sure it's an interesting 
supplement and, and a worthwhile supplement

18:01.146 --> 18:18.970
economically. I think it's sound. I think it's 
going to extend, uh, agriculture a bit. I think

18:23.536 --> 18:28.843
it's going to be as important as the, uh, as the fish 
pond of China. And, uh, more and more will be

18:30.558 --> 18:33.641
important. However, it is going to have to be 
geographically limited because there are not

18:33.741 --> 18:43.532
that many places you can get good saline water in 
inland. Mariculture is a real hope to provide the

18:45.274 --> 18:55.284
frosting on the cake, I think. Now, what do you 
intend to be your next project? Well,

19:00.916 --> 19:05.042
I don't know. My interest right now is, of course, 
consulting with industry, trying to determine

19:07.306 --> 19:23.129
whether or not we can make compatible use of the 
sea, multiple use of the sea. That's one reason

19:23.169 --> 19:28.898
we're having this symposium on the Continental 
Shelf, because of multiple use. When I go to St.

19:29.772 --> 19:39.085
Croix next week, it's because of a public hearing 
on putting an offshore terminal on the south shore

19:29.772 --> 19:39.085
of a beautiful island. Should it be done or 
shouldn't it be done? And I think I'm one that likes

19:43.511 --> 19:49.699
to look at trade-offs. You win a little and lose a 
little. I'm afraid I have to say that I consider man

19:55.304 --> 20:05.634
to be an important part of the world's ecosystem 
and that we've got to fulfill his needs. And I guess

20:06.575 --> 20:18.206
at the same time, I'm guided by one other thing, is 
that I'm generally not so concerned about what man

20:06.575 --> 20:18.206
does in the marine environment, but how he does it.

20:21.849 --> 20:24.552
He's pretty sloppy at times. Now, as for the next 
project, okay, it is to produce a book along with

20:25.696 --> 20:42.538
Darnell on the continental shelves of the United 
States, which we hope will be the definitive book

20:25.696 --> 20:42.538
on the continental shelf. And by definitive, I 
mean that it will do for research and knowledge of

20:43.919 --> 20:53.712
the continental shelf what the book on estuaries 
did years ago, several years ago, as a result of a

20:54.333 --> 21:00.021
Sapelo Island conference. And we are going to 
produce that book within the year, I think. That,

21:05.688 --> 21:08.792
to me, is going to be a major undertaking. And so 
that's enough to keep me happy right now. There are

21:13.018 --> 21:14.380
a lot of research activities. I'm working on two 
major research activities through the

21:14.400 --> 21:21.049
university. for the Bureau of Land Management on 
the myofauna, these minute little organisms that

21:22.058 --> 21:28.287
live in the sediments. And so I've got enough to do 
there. I've got six students working for me on that

21:31.191 --> 21:34.876
project right now. And I'm going to report on that 
in this symposium, as a matter of fact. So I would

21:44.108 --> 21:50.277
say what I'm trying to do there is produce an 
indicator of

21:51.488 --> 22:09.955
the importance of fouling or pollution from the 
extraction of oil and really attempt to find the

21:51.488 --> 22:09.955
answer to what it's doing in the environment. 
We've got an immense amount of work that's been

22:09.975 --> 22:20.230
done in the laboratory on petroleum pollution, 
but we have very little that's been done in the

22:09.975 --> 22:20.230
field. We've come up with a method of assaying 
that. And I have been invited by the USGS to

22:24.664 --> 22:42.261
consider entering into a big activity with them

22:24.664 --> 22:42.261
in September because of this little method we've 
come up with. So I guess that's about it.
