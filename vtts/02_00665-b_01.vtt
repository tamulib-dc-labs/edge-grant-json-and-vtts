00:07.304 --> 00:16.504
Now, the first series of questions really involve 
your academic training and your direction

00:07.304 --> 00:16.504
towards oceanography, or what directed you 
towards oceanography. So would you begin there,

00:16.524 --> 00:18.509
please? OK.

00:22.019 --> 00:38.747
My first background in oceanography came from a 
background in geophysics where I was at the

00:22.019 --> 00:38.747
California Institute of Technology from 1948 to 
1952 as an undergraduate. I started out in physics

00:39.128 --> 00:46.761
and then got interested in field work, 
geophysics, got into geology and geophysics

00:39.128 --> 00:46.761
there. Completed a Bachelor of Science program in 
1952. And about the same time, I started hearing

00:53.259 --> 00:58.004
about the oceans in different ways. I think like 
most everybody hears about the oceans nowadays

00:58.184 --> 01:02.369
too. And heard also about the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography, which wasn't very far from where

01:03.390 --> 01:11.719
I lived. So the summer of, or the spring of 1952, 
shortly before I was graduating, I went down to

01:12.492 --> 01:22.964
talk with a few people down there. I was given a 
couple of people's names. I didn't know anybody

01:27.829 --> 01:36.359
down there to talk with and get introduced to what 
oceanography was all about, particularly in the

01:27.829 --> 01:36.359
geophysical side. And I think I spoke initially 
down there with Roger Revell, who kind of

01:43.255 --> 01:47.861
nonplussed me with the question, well, what do you 
want to do? And I said, well, I'm not sure. What is

01:50.624 --> 01:52.186
there to do in oceanography? And during a very busy 
meeting, a scientific meeting down there, which I

01:53.187 --> 02:08.166
think was going on with the Institute of 
Geophysics, I heard some interesting talks, and

01:53.187 --> 02:08.166
then Ravel was kind enough to give me an hour or so of 
his time after the meeting and asked me this

02:08.483 --> 02:18.232
question and listened to my background and hear 
what I wanted to do in oceanography. And after

02:18.293 --> 02:27.702
that, he steered me over to Russell Raitt, who was a 
geophysicist there working in seismic

02:18.293 --> 02:27.702
refraction. And I talked with Russ for a while, and 
he offered me a job for the summer down at Scripps.

02:35.209 --> 02:36.330
So I took it. summer job, went down for the summer 
and got involved with some of the instrumentation

02:36.985 --> 02:46.837
problems of doing seismic work at sea. And got a 
couple of short cruises under my belt that summer

02:48.399 --> 03:06.722
with the so-called bottle snatchers, the 
physical oceanographers who were making

02:48.399 --> 03:06.722
hydrographic casts offshore near California, 
and learned what going to sea was like on a small

02:48.399 --> 03:06.722
ship. at least in the summer outside of 
California.

03:12.501 --> 03:17.045
The summer went very fast. And as it turned out, the 
seismic work I was doing and the instrumentation I

03:17.226 --> 03:23.732
was working on with Dr. Raid was being developed 
for a cruise that was being started in the fall to go

03:23.833 --> 03:35.865
to the South Pacific, one of the first major 
cruises of Scripps designated Capricorn. And

03:36.470 --> 03:48.842
near the end of the summer, Russ asked me whether I 
might be interested to go on this cruise, which was

03:36.470 --> 03:48.842
four months long, October to February, something 
like that. And I thought it over, because during

03:48.862 --> 04:03.536
the meanwhile, I had began thinking seriously 
about getting into graduate school at Scripps for

03:48.862 --> 04:03.536
the fall and had applied and was ready to do that. 
And Russ suggested I might as well go on this cruise

04:06.862 --> 04:14.290
because that was part of any oceanographer's 
training program anyway, and that'd be just like

04:06.862 --> 04:14.290
going to graduate school. So I agreed. And that was 
sort of my launching point for major

04:17.753 --> 04:25.902
oceanography.

04:25.922 --> 04:29.706
I could get into some of the details of that cruise. 
Right, right. What were your impressions as sort

04:31.127 --> 04:35.552
of a first-timer on an oceanographic cruise? 
Well, I was kind of fascinated by everything, and

04:36.224 --> 04:59.680
everything was new, and it, you know, I'd never 
been out on any major cruise at all in my life, and I

04:36.224 --> 04:59.680
was, I guess, you know, having some of the same 
feelings that maybe a person like Christopher

04:36.224 --> 04:59.680
Columbus had about going out to sea. You know, 
what's on the other side of the shelf edge out

04:59.700 --> 05:03.987
there? And the first leg of the cruise was from San 
Diego out to the, I think, Inuit Tower. In fact, the

05:13.072 --> 05:18.819
ship was participating in some of those initial 
atom bomb tests at that time, 1952. And they were

05:19.680 --> 05:26.289
physical oceanographers and chemists were 
taking samples and doing some studies of the

05:19.680 --> 05:26.289
islands out there. And Professor Ray was not on the 
first leg, but I remember the first leg was being

05:26.309 --> 05:33.298
headed up by Arthur Maxwell. who was a graduate 
student at Scripps at that time, and was my first

05:34.122 --> 05:41.270
contact with the people actually doing work at 
Scripps. And Art was then doing the heat flow work

05:41.310 --> 05:43.852
at Scripps. I wasn't involved at all. And he did 
that as his thesis program. One of the, some of the

05:50.760 --> 05:59.269
first heat flow measurements ever made at sea, 
which originally got started that same summer

05:50.760 --> 05:59.269
with Sir Edward Bullard. We've probably talked 
about this already. So those were kind of exciting

06:03.097 --> 06:09.688
days of new instrumentation, new things going on 
in oceanography, all coming along very suddenly.

06:09.768 --> 06:11.411
And I was just getting into it myself. So I felt part 
of that excitement, I think, during the work. We

06:15.438 --> 06:17.101
were going to do new things at sea. Seismic 
refraction hadn't been done very much. And I was

06:20.406 --> 06:25.915
participating in that particular program as 
essentially a technician to help out on that

06:20.406 --> 06:25.915
program. At the same time, we were going out to 
these coral islands. I'd never seen coral islands

06:28.885 --> 06:36.453
diving, and I was interested in diving and 
underwater exploration and things of this sort.

06:36.473 --> 06:40.818
So there was a whole diving program on board, for 
example, to look at coral reefs. I wasn't a

06:40.838 --> 06:51.849
professional diver myself, but I participated in 
a little bit of that, skin diving and snorkeling,

06:40.838 --> 06:51.849
which was part of the attraction to me at that time 
for oceanography. It still is to some extent. So we

06:55.477 --> 07:12.394
spent some time out at the islands there and then 
had a pretty long cruise, four months long, which

06:55.477 --> 07:12.394
took us down through the South Pacific Islands, 
the beautiful weather, kind of South Pacific

06:55.477 --> 07:12.394
cruise thing. But spending most of our time at sea, 
of course, doing these major seismic progression

07:12.694 --> 07:17.960
experiments. I think we did more refraction work 
that cruise that had ever been done before

07:17.980 --> 07:23.425
anywhere. a large number of stations, which I 
can't remember. And particularly, I remember the

07:28.258 --> 07:36.146
people on board who were some of the pioneers in 
oceanography. Roger Revelle joined us out after

07:36.887 --> 07:41.751
the first transit out. He wasn't with us on the 
first flight. He joined us in a week talk in a

07:44.034 --> 07:51.020
bikini, and then was with us for the rest of the 
cruise, which lasted about three and a half

07:44.034 --> 07:51.020
months. And Russ Ray.

07:55.113 --> 07:57.158
And Walter Monk was with us. And Martin Johnson, 
who was one of the first, well, he was co-author of

07:57.980 --> 08:04.254
the book, The Oceans. And he was doing a lot of 
plankton sampling. And Walter Monk was kind of

08:08.965 --> 08:13.375
doing everything, like he always does. And I think 
he was sort of in between some research programs of

08:13.996 --> 08:23.145
his own and wanted to go on this cruise, which was 
really an exciting event. Oh, and we had Willard

08:23.165 --> 08:33.375
Baskin, Bill Baskin, along with us, who is kind of 
an engineering entrepreneur at sea. I don't know

08:33.395 --> 08:34.496
whether you've talked with him. No. He'd be a 
fascinating person to talk to, too, if you can. He

08:40.253 --> 08:46.538
has a whole story of his own, which is fascinating, 
but I think I should let him tell it. Is he here at

08:46.759 --> 08:48.040
Wato? No, he's now in a private firm out in Long 
Beach, California. I think he works for the state

08:51.903 --> 08:58.649
now, the State Department of Water Resources or 
something like that in California. But he still

08:58.669 --> 09:01.651
keeps contacts with oceanography. We have a ship 
here now that was designed by him. We just got the

09:04.534 --> 09:09.298
Alcoa Sea Probe, which is an aluminum vessel built 
for either recovering large objects from the

09:09.937 --> 09:17.086
bottom of the ocean, it's got a big derrick on it, or 
drilling. And we're about to use it, try to use it,

09:17.106 --> 09:22.212
in a research capacity. But we'll see how that goes 
in the next year. Anyway, that was sort of my

09:26.677 --> 09:29.501
introduction to oceanography. I wasn't involved

09:34.034 --> 09:46.870
Arch Maxwell, his measurements, but I was very 
busy with the marine refraction program and was

09:34.034 --> 09:46.870
intending to get more involved with that after the 
cruise in terms of working up data, interpreting

09:34.034 --> 09:46.870
data. But as it turned out, I got drafted right 
after the cruise, spent a couple of years in the

09:47.771 --> 09:57.223
Army, and

09:57.524 --> 10:02.970
took a little sidetrack at that point, instead of 
coming directly back into oceanography. It was

10:03.531 --> 10:21.111
clear at Scripps that I think, and something I 
still tell students, is that we really need to, a

10:03.531 --> 10:21.111
person who's serious about oceanography 
probably doesn't want to major in oceanography as

10:03.531 --> 10:21.111
an undergraduate. Much better to have a basic 
science background, physics, math, chemistry,

10:21.131 --> 10:27.278
engineering, biology. and then get into a 
specialty of oceanography, because then you can

10:28.186 --> 10:40.887
bring this major field into the field of 
oceanography and have a much better basic

10:28.186 --> 10:40.887
background than you would if you had an 
oceanographic undergraduate degree. So I

10:40.907 --> 10:50.042
decided I needed a little more background in math 
and physics, so I went up here to Harvard for a year

10:40.907 --> 10:50.042
and a half. to essentially take more courses in 
math and physics, sort of get myself brushed up on

10:50.410 --> 10:57.283
things after spending a couple of years in the 
Army. Yes, enlisted then. I didn't get sent

11:00.069 --> 11:05.279
overseas during the Army, but I was stationed in 
Maryland in the Chemical Corps. So it wasn't all

11:05.880 --> 11:08.385
bad. I was very eager to get back into research 
again. So I studied for a while under Francis Birch

11:12.969 --> 11:19.959
up here at Harvard, who's a geophysicist, solid 
earth geophysicist. Not much, he's not very much

11:19.979 --> 11:33.360
involved with oceanography, but I took a lot of 
courses both under him and under other people at

11:19.979 --> 11:33.360
Harvard and took a master's degree in Harvard in 
geophysical sciences. Then I went back to Scripps

11:34.471 --> 11:37.214
in 1956, I think. Yeah, 1956. And started a formal 
graduate program there. And went through the

11:43.862 --> 11:48.588
general courses there. And after a year, I thought 
I might get back into the marine refraction work.

11:56.658 --> 11:59.642
But it was clear that there was a lot of interest in 
diplo measurements. And see, after Art Maxwell

11:59.662 --> 12:03.246
had done his measurements and interpreted them, 
And they turned out to be so unusual. And people

12:06.505 --> 12:09.110
thought that should be encouraged. And I was 
encouraged to get involved with the heat flow work

12:09.210 --> 12:17.185
and see by Russ Raid and others, Roger Abell and 
others in Scripps at that time. So I kind of

12:18.430 --> 12:22.796
gathered all the equipment that had been left at 
Scripps. Art Maxwell had since left Scripps and

12:22.876 --> 12:29.045
gone to the ONR, Office of Naval Research, in 
Washington, DC. He'd finished all his field work.

12:30.848 --> 12:34.834
Hadn't quite finished writing up his thesis, but 
he was doing that in Washington. He wanted

12:34.854 --> 12:36.897
somebody to continue that field program. So I got 
involved with that and started getting ready for

12:38.219 --> 12:44.708
another major cruise that I went on for another 
four months. Those were the days when graduate

12:48.754 --> 12:57.645
students really went to sea, as they still do in 
many institutions, but usually not for so long.

12:57.665 --> 12:59.768
We're a little bit spoiled nowadays. Well, 
conditions are different. We don't have the same

13:02.452 --> 13:06.477
emphasis on data gathering as we did at that time. 
So I went to sea for four months on the downwind

13:07.570 --> 13:21.399
expedition, which was headed by Bill Menard at 
Scripps, and was essentially a geological,

13:07.570 --> 13:21.399
geophysical expedition in 1956. Is the tape 
running? Oh yeah, we're still doing it. Let's see,

13:29.558 --> 13:33.002
it was 56, 57. That was the international 
geophysical year, which was, got some momentum

13:33.082 --> 13:40.131
from many quarters. The United States was a big 
participant. So oceanography had been enjoying a

13:43.075 --> 13:46.299
large increase of funding at that time. We could 
support some fairly large expeditions. And

13:48.422 --> 13:58.114
fortunately, I was given some funding and support 
to get this instrumentation together with the

13:48.422 --> 13:58.114
support of other people at Scripps. and went on 
this cruise where I managed to, we managed to get

13:58.803 --> 14:14.762
quite a few workflow measurements at sea, which 
formed the basis of my eventual graduate work at

13:58.803 --> 14:14.762
Scripps. And after I got back from that 
expedition, I was able to start working on the

14:14.782 --> 14:23.612
interpretation of the measurements. It turned 
out that the distribution of measurements was

14:24.301 --> 14:36.883
such that we were concentrating on this major 
geological feature called the East Pacific Rise

14:24.301 --> 14:36.883
in the South Pacific. Not much was known about 
that. It turned out to have very high heat flow and

14:38.866 --> 14:45.939
was one of these enigmas before we understood 
anything about plate tectonics. Why was that heat

14:45.959 --> 14:48.503
flow so high on the East Pacific Rise? and we mapped 
it in several places, able to run profiles, and got

14:49.158 --> 15:03.562
a general picture of high and low heat flow 
associated with these major tectonic features on

14:49.158 --> 15:03.562
the Earth. And so I wrote that up in the thesis 
during the next few years, meanwhile

15:03.582 --> 15:10.553
participating in a few other expeditions. I was, I 
guess, I was a field-oriented type person with

15:14.605 --> 15:18.552
instrumentation. That was needed at that time a 
lot because we had so few measurements to see. I

15:26.406 --> 15:36.184
guess heat flow was also one of the first

15:26.406 --> 15:36.184
instrumentation systems to work in the deep sea, 
electronically. I think that's true. When Art

15:38.146 --> 15:48.939
Maxwell and Sir Edward Bullard started it, I think 
it was the first deep sea electronic instrument to

15:38.146 --> 15:48.939
work reliably in the deep sea. I don't know. There 
may have been some current meters and things like

15:49.821 --> 15:51.823
that. But electronics just hadn't been developed 
at all. Before, we were using vacuum tubes in the

15:54.146 --> 16:04.639
instrument, big pressure case, and big 
instrument, recording on chart paper inside the

15:54.146 --> 16:04.639
instrument. And it was all very bulky and 
cumbersome.

16:09.078 --> 16:14.364
And it's amazing what electronics has done for us 
in the ensuing 15 or 20 years. Just fantastic. Been

16:16.647 --> 16:22.093
a tremendous fallout from the space program for 
oceanography in many ways.

16:23.274 --> 16:28.440
But that was the job I had to get myself involved 
with all phases of the research. Putting the

16:29.602 --> 16:32.605
hardware together, making the instrument work, 
interpreting the measurements. So you had to be a

16:35.070 --> 16:37.153
jack of all trades in those days. That's kind of 
what made you successful. You could do all things

16:40.919 --> 16:49.112
reasonably well and get a thesis out at the same 
time. One of the problems then with oceanography

16:49.132 --> 16:57.985
was that students tended to spend a long time 
getting a degree. They essentially were getting

16:58.235 --> 17:05.363
into oceanography as a research person, as a 
worker. And they worked for a major research

17:05.383 --> 17:09.628
professor that was involved in some field. But it 
wasn't a push to get through your degree at that

17:09.668 --> 17:13.292
time. And I could see during the time I was going 
through the program that I felt some push to get

17:13.312 --> 17:24.745
through, perhaps because I was a little older and 
had gotten in the Army and things of this sort. And I

17:24.765 --> 17:27.448
said, well, I better get this over with and get it 
over. I was essentially through in three years,

17:27.715 --> 17:32.960
although I didn't get my thesis written up until 
the fourth year. That was unusual at Scripps. It

17:34.142 --> 17:40.888
usually took five or six years to get through a 
graduate program. Scripps was kind of a funny

17:42.250 --> 17:48.636
entity at that time, because it was sort of a 
research institute separate from the rest of the

17:42.250 --> 17:48.636
university. We were actually part of the 
University of California in Los Angeles,

17:48.676 --> 17:54.162
although we were 200 miles from Los Angeles. There 
was no UCSD at that time. And so I got my degree from

17:59.009 --> 18:05.238
UCLA officially, even though I was down in Scripps 
all the time. And I had professors on my committee

18:05.258 --> 18:13.451
who were at UCLA, geophysicists, not 
oceanographers, but people who were worried

18:05.258 --> 18:13.451
about the solid earth. And I was worried about the 
solid earth underneath the oceans. And so they

18:17.497 --> 18:22.424
helped stimulate the whole atmosphere of new 
ocean exploration. No one knew anything about the

18:22.504 --> 18:24.888
oceans at that time, essentially. Nothing about 
sea floor spreading, nothing about plate

18:25.809 --> 18:30.136
tectonics. And I think the heat flow measurements 
were partially instrumental in developing these

18:30.396 --> 18:45.478
new ideas, along with the geomagnetism and other 
things that you'll probably hear from Jim

18:30.396 --> 18:45.478
Hertzberg about and others.

18:52.850 --> 19:06.761
Well, you were saying not much had been done with 
heat flow then and that primarily that you had

18:52.850 --> 19:06.761
thought the instrumentation had developed, 
excuse me, to the point where it made all of this

18:52.850 --> 19:06.761
possible. Yeah. Yeah, I think that was sort of the 
point where We were benefiting a lot from things

19:12.712 --> 19:16.949
like the space program in terms of instruments. 
And we were learning how to do things with

19:16.969 --> 19:23.515
instruments in the DC much better than we had 
before. And I guess I felt, getting into the

19:23.900 --> 19:35.593
instrumentation myself, that we had a fairly 
reliable set of instruments to go to sea. And so we

19:35.613 --> 19:42.740
started to develop this program of getting a lot 
more measurements at sea on several expeditions.

19:42.760 --> 19:52.911
I was on three or four, one to the Gulf of 
California,

19:42.760 --> 19:52.911
off California, North Pacific, And I can't 
remember all the cruises. There were just several

19:56.103 --> 20:01.978
that I was participating in at the time I was a 
graduate student. And so finally I got my PhD.

20:03.783 --> 20:10.680
1960, I think it was. Of course, it was very 
important to get your reputation established, as

20:12.145 --> 20:20.255
it is in all fields of science, by publishing. So I 
had gotten out a couple of papers at that time, too,

20:20.276 --> 20:30.208
just about the same time I was getting through my 
PhD and continuing the work at sea. So I stayed in

20:30.228 --> 20:36.256
that for a few more years at Scripps as a research 
scientist. I was on the staff for three or four

20:36.276 --> 20:40.802
years and felt that that was very beneficial for me 
at the time, because I could take advantage of the

20:41.727 --> 20:56.449
instrumentation and setup, the organizational 
setup that I was familiar with at Scripps for a few

20:41.727 --> 20:56.449
years, to get a lot of work done to see, to get a lot of 
papers published, which I did. So that kind of

20:58.392 --> 21:05.423
caught me up with things, and I suppose sort of gave 
me a reputation in the field at that time. that

21:05.690 --> 21:16.287
still stays with me, even though I may not be as 
active now as I once was in that particular field,

21:05.690 --> 21:16.287
personally.

21:18.551 --> 21:28.407
But about that time, I guess I was feeling a little 
bit of the need to diversify my own interests and

21:18.551 --> 21:28.407
test my own fields of interest and what I really 
wanted to do for the rest of my life. So I took an

21:32.469 --> 21:36.234
opportunity to go do something entirely 
different. Not entirely different, but quite

21:36.875 --> 21:40.881
different from what I'd been doing. In 1964, I took 
a job in UNESCO in Paris. Okay, one second. Now,

21:50.201 --> 21:52.644
we've got a blank that's occurring between 60 and 
64. Okay. Now, obviously, you were doing

21:52.904 --> 21:57.008
something between 60 and 64 besides writing 
papers. Where were you then? Right. Well, I was at

21:58.109 --> 21:59.050
Scripps. This is the period when I was, after my 
PhD, when I was on the staff at Scripps. That's what

22:03.635 --> 22:04.316
I thought. And was heavily involved with the heat 
flow work. Okay. This is when I went to see a lot. And

22:09.040 --> 22:12.524
who was working in heat flow with you between 60 and 
64? Well, I... I was essentially the principal

22:13.645 --> 22:17.594
researcher experience at that time. At the same 
time, other institutions were getting involved

22:18.115 --> 22:24.850
more heavily, like Lamont and Woods Hole with 
other people. John Reitzel was here at Woods Hole.

22:27.256 --> 22:28.218
I don't know whether you know him. No, I don't know 
him. He was involved with people over several

22:29.361 --> 22:31.806
years. He's not in the field anymore. And then Mark 
Langseth at LeMond, who you may interview. Well, I

22:39.279 --> 22:41.001
haven't been to LeMond yet, but I will. He's about 
the same vintage as I am, and started getting

22:41.021 --> 22:45.826
involved. Well, Maurice Ewing was an inventor of 
another type of instrumentation, similar, at

22:45.886 --> 22:52.133
LeMond. And Mark Langseth was heavily involved in 
that, and I still have a lot of contact with him at

22:52.753 --> 22:57.338
LeMond. about the same vintage as I was. They were 
sort of doing an independent program over in the

22:59.392 --> 23:01.945
Atlantic. It was the same kind of things. I think we 
kind of had to jump on them at Scripps because Sir

23:04.743 --> 23:12.615
Edward Bullard had gotten the thing started in 
1952 with Art Maxwell. So we had a lot more

23:12.635 --> 23:18.844
measurements in the Pacific than we did in the 
Atlantic in the early 1960s. And at the same time,

23:19.766 --> 23:28.118
the new geological ideas were coming along right 
then about the nature of these mid-ocean ridges

23:19.766 --> 23:28.118
and what they represented. We didn't really have 
seafloor spreading back then. So we were

23:30.767 --> 23:40.063
essentially kind of making measurements all over 
the place to understand the distribution of heat

23:30.767 --> 23:40.063
flow in conjunction with the geological features 
of the seafloor. The big aseismic ridges, such as

23:40.844 --> 23:49.279
the Cocos and Tehuantepec Ridge, Gulf of 
California, which turned out to have high heat

23:40.844 --> 23:49.279
flow. And Lennard, about the time, was very active 
in interpreting the East Pacific rise and how it

23:49.883 --> 24:09.296
represented a major mountain forming feature, 
which was going right up the East Pacific rise,

23:49.883 --> 24:09.296
coming from the South Pacific up into the Gulf of 
California, and then right up into the western

23:49.883 --> 24:09.296
part of the United States. And the idea was that 
there were big convection currents going on down

24:10.699 --> 24:15.587
under under the crust of the earth, and that these 
convection currents were bringing heat up, which

24:15.888 --> 24:23.682
we could measure heat loss through the surface. 
And then this also, I think, our ocean work

24:24.584 --> 24:32.177
stimulated a lot more work on land at the same time. 
I started to get involved with a land program,

24:32.718 --> 24:37.086
also, of heat flow measurements and scripts. 
because Victor Bakke, who you may have talked to in

24:37.488 --> 24:55.041
the scripts, came there about that time, early 
1960s, and brought his expertise, geophysical

24:37.488 --> 24:55.041
expertise, of doing work on land, and he and I 
started the program of making heat flow

24:37.488 --> 24:55.041
measurements on land. I did never finish that. I 
left Scripps before that time. It was carried on by

24:57.846 --> 25:01.271
John Slater and Bob Warren and Vic Bakke. 
Eventually published the work on land, showing

25:01.972 --> 25:11.388
the high heat flow continuation of the Gulf of 
California up into the western United States. But

25:11.408 --> 25:19.020
my work between 1960 and 64 was essentially a 
continuation of the work I'd done there as a

25:11.408 --> 25:19.020
graduate student. making heat flow 
measurements, tying it in with other seismic

25:19.895 --> 25:30.144
refraction work, other geophysical 
measurements, geological measurements, and see

25:19.895 --> 25:30.144
to understand these major geological features. 
Now, were you teaching classes at Scripps then,

25:30.764 --> 25:32.726
too? I wasn't teaching much. This was one of the 
other things that kind of made me leave Scripps, I

25:34.567 --> 25:49.480
think, eventually, because there was this big 
dichotomy, I felt and still feel, existed at

25:34.567 --> 25:49.480
Scripps between the research staff, which I was a 
part of, and the... and the academic sides of

25:49.848 --> 25:55.682
things, the teaching staff, and still existed 
scripts. We don't have that here at Woods Hole, at

25:55.943 --> 25:59.090
least right at the present time. I hope we don't get 
that, because it tends to divide people a little

25:59.110 --> 26:02.659
bit. And I felt, although I had a lot of freedom in my 
shirts, that I didn't have much to say about the way

26:03.061 --> 26:11.091
the university is run or the teaching of students 
or anything like that. I did help give lectures in

26:11.111 --> 26:14.576
some courses. I was invited to do that and talked 
about it before. Bill Menard taught a course. I

26:18.981 --> 26:22.205
think Russ Raitt and others were teaching courses 
at that time. But I was still fairly specialized at

26:23.226 --> 26:26.571
the time. And I felt I needed some broadening of my 
own background. So I took an entirely different

26:30.483 --> 26:44.144
tack at that time and went over to UNESCO in Paris in 
1964, sort of at the urging of Roger Revelle and my

26:30.483 --> 26:44.144
other mentors at Scripps that there might be an 
interesting thing to do. Sounds like a nice

26:44.665 --> 26:46.608
background. Well, that's probably the 
fluorescent lights, but that's okay. It's one of

26:51.296 --> 26:52.517
these things. Before we leave Scripps and you go to 
UNESCO, I want you to make some comments about

26:53.639 --> 26:57.445
Scripps. What was Roger Revelle like? Roger was a 
very exciting person. He was director at Scripps

27:01.795 --> 27:06.540
at that time, and had been for a number of years. He 
had the ability to give you an excitement of the

27:07.741 --> 27:20.355
field of oceanography that nobody else, or very 
few others, were able to do at the time, I think.

27:20.375 --> 27:22.517
Walter Monk could do that to some extent. And Russ 
Ray, too, in his particular field of seismic

27:23.097 --> 27:27.422
refraction. Russ, well, what I learned from Russ 
Ray, I'll just sort of ramble, and then we'll go on

27:27.723 --> 27:41.658
through this, is the real appreciation of good 
measurements of C. Russ was kind of a

27:27.723 --> 27:41.658
perfectionist, and I think still is. He wanted 
good measurements and unambiguous data that he

27:43.360 --> 27:51.748
didn't want to be wishy-washy about the 
interpretation of. So I think he more than anybody

27:56.596 --> 28:03.443
else gave me an appreciation for the good quality 
measurements at sea. And Walter Monk, I didn't

28:03.463 --> 28:15.876
know as well, because he was more involved with 
physical oceanography problems at the time than

28:03.463 --> 28:15.876
he was in geophysics. And so I wasn't too close to 
him, although we were on the same floor at the same

28:15.896 --> 28:21.282
time. He was more in oceanographic problems. But I 
could see that Walter was thinking a lot about the

28:24.946 --> 28:35.541
quantitative aspects and theoretical aspects of 
oceanography and geophysics. And I always had a

28:35.561 --> 28:48.901
feeling, a little bit, of being in awe of Walter 
when I talked to him, because he clearly had a much

28:35.561 --> 28:48.901
deeper theoretical background than I did and 
understood a lot about geophysics. I think

28:50.283 --> 28:52.446
Walter, I don't know whether you interviewed him. 
Yes, I did. was attracted into the field also by

28:53.853 --> 28:57.477
Roger Revelle to some extent. They both came to 
Scripps. About the same time. Temporaneously, I

29:00.120 --> 29:01.161
think. Actually, Sverdrup was probably the 
person that attracted them. Revelle maintains

29:04.604 --> 29:07.007
Walter Monk came there to meet a young lady. That's 
his explanation. That could be. That could be. I

29:10.871 --> 29:14.915
don't remember that history, because that was 
before I arrived on the scene. And I didn't know

29:14.936 --> 29:16.437
Sverdrup either. But I know they both benefited 
under his guidance. Roger was the kind of a person

29:21.629 --> 29:39.442
who was very broad, and he understood many aspects 
of oceanography, and was always encouraging

29:21.629 --> 29:39.442
students to get involved and exciting them about 
the aspects of oceanography, wherever their

29:21.629 --> 29:39.442
interests might lie. And I think his contribution 
to my education

29:46.148 --> 29:51.999
was partly through his own research, which was in 
heat flow with Art Maxwell initially. He wrote a

29:52.120 --> 29:59.694
lot of papers about the implications of these 
unusually high measurements of heat flow in the

29:52.120 --> 29:59.694
oceans. And I benefited from those in my initial 
stages. But he also contributed by directing me

30:08.221 --> 30:17.534
and channeling me into the areas that he thought 
were fruitful, were going to pay off in the next few

30:08.221 --> 30:17.534
years, like heat flow or seismic refraction. And 
so I'm very grateful for that, because I didn't

30:18.315 --> 30:28.350
know anything about oceanography at the time, and 
was able to follow that channel very, very good at

30:18.315 --> 30:28.350
that particular time. So I considered Roger as a 
major contributor to the direction I took in my own

30:29.331 --> 30:37.182
research. Besides being a very personable 
friend, he had me over at his house and introduced

30:39.018 --> 30:53.024
me to his family.

30:55.368 --> 30:57.432
It was kind of a big family at Scripps at that time.
