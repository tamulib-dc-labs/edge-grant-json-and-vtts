00:08.165 --> 00:11.751
What experiences did you have with the low-income 
government? Okay, well, a lot of our, well, first

00:11.771 --> 00:18.681
of all, all of our projects had to be approved by 
them. Secondly, in order to kind of reinforce this

00:19.443 --> 00:29.458
image that, you know, it was them that was actually 
giving all of this aid to the local people. In other

00:29.639 --> 00:36.349
words, it was the American government giving aid 
to the royal government, which was then handing it

00:29.639 --> 00:36.349
over to... The people that a lot of the projects, in 
fact, almost all the projects I worked on, had to

00:36.835 --> 00:47.589
have not only law government approval, but law 
government involvement. Now, some of the places I

00:47.609 --> 01:00.707
worked, there were, in effect, no law government 
officials or next to none, and it was in part

00:47.609 --> 01:00.707
because either the areas were too primitive or too 
unsafe. In other places where I worked, they were

01:00.727 --> 01:05.914
all over the place, and... A couple of jobs that I 
worked while I was there, I worked daily with

01:06.485 --> 01:13.255
somebody in the Lao government. I helped do a 
census in between the time I got run out or shot out

01:13.275 --> 01:23.690
of this area and was waiting for a new field 
assignment. They decided that they ought to put me

01:23.710 --> 01:33.724
in a city where it was nice and safe

01:23.710 --> 01:33.724
so I could calm down a bit. In the meantime, they 
could find me something new back out in the

01:34.717 --> 01:40.346
countryside. So I worked, oh, I've forgotten how 
long it was, about eight weeks, I guess, with a Lao

01:40.386 --> 01:55.969
government project in which they were doing the 
first census of the second largest city in the

01:40.386 --> 01:55.969
country. And in fact, it was more the Lao 
government's project than ours and mine. since I

02:01.565 --> 02:06.632
got in at the last minute my role, and it was pretty 
minimal. And then there were other times in which I

02:08.415 --> 02:21.734
wasn't working with government officials so much 
directly, but there would be a local military

02:08.415 --> 02:21.734
commander who would be basically the kingpin of 
the area. And we would, in effect, have to get his

02:23.136 --> 02:26.882
permission to do things. And in one case in 
particular, a place where I worked 14 months, The

02:31.653 --> 02:47.608
guy wanted it to be very clear to local people that 
we were, that he was a top dog there, and that

02:31.653 --> 02:47.608
anything that we, the two Americans did there, was 
only done because he had given his permission. And

02:48.388 --> 02:54.734
so we had to learn to basically go through a kind of 
public ritual with the guy. In fact, he enjoyed

02:54.954 --> 03:01.120
giving the impression that the things we were 
working on were his ideas. And again, that was just

03:02.348 --> 03:07.653
something that I had to learn to live with. He was 
kind of a jerk, although given the kinds of

03:07.673 --> 03:26.212
military commanders that were around, he was, in a 
lot of ways, a lot more benign than a lot of the

03:07.673 --> 03:26.212
others. But he was no knight in shining armor. At 
any rate... we frequently had to go to him and

03:32.875 --> 03:39.545
convince him that something we wanted to do was a 
good idea. That often meant literally getting

03:39.605 --> 03:57.330
drunk with a guy and after a time you could convince 
him to do almost anything and then he would sort of

03:39.605 --> 03:57.330
publicly announce that he had decided to you know 
either dig wells or you know, grow rice or whatever

03:58.475 --> 04:06.424
it was we wanted to do, and then he would say 
something like, well, you know, the two Americans

03:58.475 --> 04:06.424
are going to run this. But it all had to appear to 
locals, at least on the surface, that he was coming

04:07.085 --> 04:21.842
up with all these ideas, and he was basically 
delegating us to do kind of the dirty work. So we

04:22.963 --> 04:26.187
were involved in that fashion, and then Last but 
not least, we were somewhat dependent on the local

04:26.605 --> 04:36.376
military and commanders for our safety. Although 
when I was attacked, we were within 200 yards of a

04:37.638 --> 04:47.869
military camp and it didn't stop people from 
coming into our backyard and taking a shot at us.

04:49.151 --> 04:51.313
And having military protection didn't keep this 
19-year-old kid from being killed four miles from

04:51.766 --> 04:58.655
where I live. And later on, a boat driver within a 
mile of my house being assassinated.

05:09.649 --> 05:16.357
In fact, to protect us, in one of the places I 
worked, they put a minefield right behind our

05:09.649 --> 05:16.357
house because we were right on the edge of a jungle. 
And one of the things that eventually drove us away

05:17.238 --> 05:21.604
from that place was that... There was a lot of 
activity going on, and animals would set off mines

05:22.293 --> 05:31.566
at night, and we had gotten so gun-shy. 
Increasingly, our radius of operation had been

05:32.247 --> 05:50.072
shrunk because our safety was no longer 
guaranteed, and we were down to just a couple of

05:32.247 --> 05:50.072
miles from where we were living, and since most of 
the people we were working with on a daily basis

05:32.247 --> 05:50.072
were farther out than two miles from our a home that 
the people we lived among most immediately were

05:50.643 --> 05:59.712
among the least cooperative.

06:02.535 --> 06:12.784
So not being able to work and being scared to death 
all the time with animals tripping off lines at

06:02.535 --> 06:12.784
night, we finally left that particular place. So 
our involvement with the Lao government was

06:13.245 --> 06:18.490
fairly extensive.

06:20.579 --> 06:26.286
Oftentimes, not because we wanted to, but because 
we had very little choice. We went ahead and did

06:27.128 --> 06:38.943
things, but we frequently had to include them in 
some fashion, or get their permission, or that

06:27.128 --> 06:38.943
sort of thing. What was the attitude of the U.S. 
government towards the Irish?

06:44.751 --> 06:50.518
Well, I mean, I guess the official policy was to 
keep the country from falling into communist

06:51.123 --> 06:53.185
hands.

06:56.608 --> 07:00.312
Sort of unofficially, the attitudes vary widely. 
Like I said, some of the people that I worked for

07:00.412 --> 07:05.657
within AID were former volunteers. Some of them 
were like us in IBS, tend to be neutralists and were

07:06.578 --> 07:18.970
there simply to help the people. There were also 
people within AID who were hawks with regard to the

07:19.253 --> 07:25.480
war. One guy I worked for sort of indirectly used to 
look at the map of Laos and say, gee, look at all this

07:25.881 --> 07:32.649
rice land. Wouldn't the Chinese just love to have 
their hands on it? It's a good thing we're here kind

07:36.053 --> 07:39.197
of thing, in other words. You could surmise from 
that that if we weren't there, the Chinese would,

07:39.237 --> 07:47.527
the communist Chinese would take over the country 
because of the rice land. It was always kind of a A

07:49.122 --> 07:53.827
joke to me because Laos is almost 80% mountainous. 
There's very little rice land there. It's really

07:58.633 --> 08:02.217
not worth taking over. It's more of a burden. One of 
the reasons we were paying almost 100% of the royal

08:04.880 --> 08:13.190
government's daily bills is because there was no 
natural resource base. And now the Soviet Union is

08:13.690 --> 08:16.834
having to do what we were doing for the Royal Lao 
government, they're having to do for the

08:17.219 --> 08:20.823
Communist government. I mean, those people are 
dealing with the same resource base, which is

08:21.063 --> 08:26.528
non-existent. And so, you know, just a country 
without any kind of sound financial basis for

08:26.869 --> 08:35.297
existing.

08:39.221 --> 08:42.685
What was that to you, the Russian people, for the 
U.S. government? Well, you know, the people I

08:42.705 --> 08:46.669
dealt with, the imperialists, It's one of the 
things that was hard to talk to people about

08:47.341 --> 08:55.568
because a lot of them were unsure about who I was 
exactly. And I also gathered that most local

08:57.270 --> 09:04.476
people were interested in local things, not 
national. Most people didn't have any kind of

09:05.537 --> 09:11.042
national identity or even sense of citizenship. 
Their world tended to be a very small, isolated

09:12.043 --> 09:17.348
place Valley, most of them were isolated from the 
outside world. I mean, we were flying in, that kind

09:21.040 --> 09:24.684
of thing. They didn't have cars or donkeys or 
horses, so they, for the most part, didn't know

09:25.065 --> 09:33.033
much about the outside world. So an awful lot of 
them were pretty indifferent towards the

09:33.794 --> 09:38.139
American government. They knew that the American 
government was in the country. Many of them just

09:42.704 --> 09:45.006
assumed that... the American government was 
there in the same capacity that the French were. In

09:49.070 --> 09:51.093
other words, we had come and taken over. A lot of 
people weren't bothered by that because, again,

09:51.874 --> 10:09.177
it didn't touch, as long as it didn't touch on their 
everyday life, they didn't much give a damn what

09:51.874 --> 10:09.177
was going on in the city or somewhere else because 
it didn't affect their everyday attempts to

09:51.874 --> 10:09.177
survive. There were some people... who did have a 
sense of nationalistic feeling and were

10:11.767 --> 10:26.122
anti-American, just like they were anti-French 
prior to the French leaving the place. And then

10:26.142 --> 10:36.374
there were people, I even had a guy working for me, 
who said, gee, I'm glad you guys took over our

10:26.142 --> 10:36.374
country, because eventually I'll be able to 
become an American citizen and go to the United

10:26.142 --> 10:36.374
States. So it was really kind of a mixture of 
viewpoints. But I found that among local military

10:42.412 --> 10:58.672
types, for instance, most of them were people who 
were drafted at gunpoint by one side or the other,

10:42.412 --> 10:58.672
and frequently they wound up changing sides from 
one side to the other, either voluntarily or

10:42.412 --> 10:58.672
involuntarily. And I found that even among the 
troops, there wasn't much of a commitment to one

10:59.193 --> 11:04.339
side or the other. There wasn't, again, any kind of 
sophisticated understanding of... You know, the

11:11.251 --> 11:28.415
American government

11:11.251 --> 11:28.415
or communism or democracy was frequently, well, 
you know, I was fighting for this side because they

11:11.251 --> 11:28.415
were the ones that caught me in the field while I was 
flying and said, you either fight for us or we'll

11:11.251 --> 11:28.415
shoot you on the spot. And both sides were doing 
that. I talked to people who had fought for the

11:32.040 --> 11:40.532
communists and had switched sides, and it was 
because the communists couldn't give them

11:32.040 --> 11:40.532
uniforms and didn't feed them and the other side 
did. So, for the most part, people, at least at the

11:43.563 --> 11:50.189
local level, weren't very ideological. 
Occasionally, you'd run across somebody whose

11:50.229 --> 12:02.882
family had been abused in some fashion or another 
by one side or the other, and so they had a kind of a

11:50.229 --> 12:02.882
personal, you know. I met a guy who was fighting on 
the Lao government side whose family had been

12:03.002 --> 12:09.068
killed in a French bombing raid and had fought for 
the communists for a long time. And then he was sent

12:12.804 --> 12:27.323
to North Vietnam for further training and was so 
upset by what he saw that he decided that even

12:12.804 --> 12:27.323
though he didn't like the French or the Americans 
that much, that they were the lesser of the two

12:12.804 --> 12:27.323
evils. So there was really a real mix of feelings. 
There wasn't any kind of uniform. But I'd say the

12:34.252 --> 12:39.038
vast majority of people didn't care much one way or 
the other. when I went to a lot of areas, especially

12:40.047 --> 12:50.018
when I was just learning languages and didn't 
speak too well and wasn't easily understood. Most

12:50.078 --> 12:52.120
people just ignored me. I worked at the first place 
I had any chance to stay long enough to do anything.

13:00.229 --> 13:02.431
At first, most adults wouldn't talk to me at all. 
And I don't think it was so much fear as it was just

13:02.932 --> 13:06.535
kind of indifference. And so for a long time, A lot 
of kids, I had a kerosene-operated refrigerator,

13:11.654 --> 13:18.622
which I could make ice, and I would give ice to kids. 
And so they would hang around, and they would teach

13:19.203 --> 13:21.445
me. I'd get a chance to practice my language, and 
they were teaching me more vocabulary and so on and

13:21.786 --> 13:29.314
so forth. And they would kind of follow me around, 
and these kids got the nickname of being the

13:29.334 --> 13:35.141
Americans' Little Soldiers. These kids would 
kind of troop behind me in a line.

13:44.138 --> 13:52.031
Well,

13:44.138 --> 13:52.031
again, most of them were indifferent to it.

13:55.036 --> 13:56.177
They didn't get much out of it. Even

13:56.258 --> 14:11.462
though there was an elected parliament and that 
sort of thing, most of the places I worked, people

13:56.258 --> 14:11.462
were either so isolated they had never had a chance 
to vote, or they did, but it was kind of meaningless

13:56.258 --> 14:11.462
to them.

14:14.733 --> 14:20.540
There were, again, some people who didn't like the 
Lao government because it had interfered in their

14:14.733 --> 14:20.540
lives in some fashion. And then I guess there were 
others who felt some loyalty to it because they had

14:20.560 --> 14:26.186
gotten some specific benefit. But again, in a 
country that's, in effect, as backward as one like

14:27.808 --> 14:42.565
Laos, most people just didn't have experience 
with government. The country was just too poor.

14:44.197 --> 14:50.064
for there to be very many government officials out 
and among the local people. Everybody knew who the

14:50.544 --> 14:53.468
king was, and the king was very popular. A

14:53.488 --> 15:03.620
reproduction of his photograph was in just about 
every house that I was ever in. But the king was a

15:05.943 --> 15:10.688
figurehead.

15:10.708 --> 15:13.191
In terms of the real government, a lot of people 
didn't know who. who was even in charge of them. Did

15:17.039 --> 15:20.844
this attitude carry over towards the Vietnamese 
people? Well, most of the people, most of the Lao

15:21.044 --> 15:31.536
that I knew, their emotions towards the 
Vietnamese could be summed up with one word, and

15:21.044 --> 15:31.536
that was fear. Most people I knew were afraid of the 
Vietnamese. partly for historical reasons and

15:36.323 --> 15:39.407
partly for contemporary ones. Historically, the 
Vietnamese have made inroads into Laos. The

15:44.334 --> 15:47.258
Vietnamese have been historically 
expansionistic. So have the Thai, and between the

15:48.560 --> 15:54.348
Thai and the Vietnamese, Laos being rapidly 
gobbled up. The French came in and made a colony out

15:56.831 --> 16:05.183
of Laos largely to keep it out of the hands of the 
British. Nobody really wanted Laos because

16:05.332 --> 16:08.777
there's nothing there. It's a money-losing kind 
of a proposition. On the other hand, the French had

16:14.045 --> 16:29.148
Cambodia and Vietnam, and the British were in 
Burma, and they didn't want the British in Laos and

16:14.045 --> 16:29.148
then have the British right next door. And so there 
was a French explorer, who did some mapping of the

16:34.103 --> 16:52.627
country, and it was he and some government 
officials in France who convinced the French

16:34.103 --> 16:52.627
government in the late 19th century that Laos was 
worth basically colonizing, but the French never

16:34.103 --> 16:52.627
invested very much money into the place.

16:55.991 --> 16:59.456
Did you ever have any experience with U.S. troops? 
The only experience I had was when I was evacuated

17:02.369 --> 17:03.611
Well, I had a couple. I was evacuated by American 
soldiers flying a couple of helicopters when I was

17:04.212 --> 17:18.431
shot at during my first temporary assignment. And 
then one time we had

17:18.451 --> 17:28.405
again made one of our daily radio check-ins. We had 
to do it twice a day. We had mentioned some attack

17:31.310 --> 17:34.955
that we had heard about that had happened about 10 
miles from us. And we just, again, reported it

17:34.995 --> 17:45.831
because we felt like we needed to keep tabs on this 
sort of thing for military purposes. We were,

17:45.891 --> 17:56.526
again, reporting this kind of thing so that there 
was some sort of pattern formed and somebody who

17:45.891 --> 17:56.526
knew more about military matters than we did could 
say, well, you know, it looks like things are

17:45.891 --> 17:56.526
heating up. You guys better get out of there. 
Somebody wouldn't say that. Well, one time when

18:01.972 --> 18:18.253
both the guy that I was working with and I were in the 
capital for R&R, they made us come out the bush

18:01.972 --> 18:18.253
about every six weeks or so, at least for a 
weekender to relax. And we were called into an

18:19.355 --> 18:22.479
office. One of our aid supervisors took us over to 
an obscure little office on aid compound. There

18:28.607 --> 18:30.409
were a couple of guys in there with American... 
military uniforms on, and they started quizzing

18:31.047 --> 18:43.321
us thoroughly about this mortar attack and 
ultimately accused us of being liars because they

18:31.047 --> 18:43.321
said, well, based on our information, this never 
happened. And we said, look, we weren't there. We

18:45.063 --> 18:46.545
just report what we heard. But they were, for some 
reason, very upset with us. But it was quite clear

18:52.131 --> 19:00.160
at that time that the American military was 
monitoring the calls that we made to our aid

19:00.443 --> 19:10.436
supervisors, and they were using information 
that we were passing along for our safety

19:00.443 --> 19:10.436
purposes, you know, for their own purposes. And in 
some of the bars I wound up, I met embassy guards.

19:20.370 --> 19:27.379
Every day we could see American fighter bombers 
flying into Laos, and it was pretty clear that they

19:20.370 --> 19:27.379
weren't flying given the direction they were 
flying. They weren't flying to North Vietnam.

19:32.126 --> 19:34.649
They were flying to somewhere in Laos. And it turns 
out that we were illegally bombing Laos, not only

19:34.709 --> 19:42.539
during the time I was there, but before I was there 
and after I was there. And I have learned,

19:43.060 --> 19:55.695
subsequent to my being there, that we dropped more 
bombs on Laos, more tonnage of bombs on Laos than we

19:43.060 --> 19:55.695
actually did on the two Vietnams.

19:55.945 --> 19:59.128
Did you have any experience with the Vietnamese 
troops? No, other than it may have been Vietnamese

19:59.148 --> 20:03.732
troops who shot at us. You know, we knew at the time 
in places where we were working that there were

20:05.433 --> 20:15.922
Vietnamese advisors working with the local 
communist forces. But I never, thank God, met any

20:16.963 --> 20:22.968
of them because if I would have gotten that close to 
them, I wouldn't be alive. There were

20:23.989 --> 20:25.530
Vietnamese... all over Laos who were there as 
immigrants. In fact, the entire middle class of

20:30.199 --> 20:36.965
Laos, in terms of merchants, were either Chinese, 
Indian, Pakistani, or Vietnamese. There were

20:37.005 --> 20:41.569
hardly any indigenous or Lao merchants. They were 
rare indeed. So a lot of restaurants I ate at were

20:43.811 --> 20:48.055
run by Vietnamese. Stores I bought things in were 
run by Vietnamese. But that was really the only

20:51.299 --> 20:56.023
direct contact I had with them. Well, things

20:56.797 --> 21:03.027
were deteriorating rapidly. When I left, it was 
pretty clear that, you know, the Vietnam War was

21:04.830 --> 21:24.981
not going well for the United States, and it was the 
Civil War in Laos, you know, the two sides being

21:04.830 --> 21:24.981
backed by the Vietnamese and Americans, 
respectively. that the Vietnamese backside was

21:25.298 --> 21:28.342
winning. And apparently it was because the 
Vietnamese were just tough individuals. There

21:35.292 --> 21:50.874
were all sorts of stories about when a Lao outpost 
would hear that they were going to be attacked and

21:35.292 --> 21:50.874
would hear that the troops that were going to 
attack them contained Vietnamese, they would

21:35.292 --> 21:50.874
just bug out. They would take off because... They 
were afraid. I never witnessed this, but there

21:54.545 --> 21:58.611
were stories about this all the time. And I did know 
that in some places...

22:09.065 --> 22:09.185
Okay. Let's see. Oh, yeah. Okay. So it was clear 
that the other side was winning. By the time I left,

22:20.301 --> 22:23.385
IBS has a voluntary group had pulled itself out of 
rural programs. We had just too many people being

22:28.204 --> 22:30.747
killed. We couldn't protect ourselves anymore. 
Before I left, I lost another couple of friends,

22:35.071 --> 22:43.619
and that was kind of the straw that broke the 
camel's back. Our organization sort of got

22:46.082 --> 22:52.528
together and decided to tell the American 
embassy, what we would do and not do, and it was

22:53.015 --> 23:14.265
pretty much unacceptable to them, and so they 
basically eliminated all of our field positions,

22:53.015 --> 23:14.265
and they kept for the remainder of the time that the 
American aid program was there, which was up until

22:53.015 --> 23:14.265
about 1975, only school teachers. So, you know, 
when I left, that process was underway.

23:23.727 --> 23:31.274
Well, I was sort of against it when I got there, and 
by the time I left, I was really against it. I mean, I

23:31.294 --> 23:34.757
wasn't a supporter of the communists. I didn't 
think they were, and I didn't think it was

23:35.218 --> 23:41.784
especially desirous that they take over. On the 
other hand, local people didn't seem to care one

23:41.824 --> 23:45.528
way or the other. And

23:45.568 --> 23:53.295
for a lot of local people, the communist 
government wasn't going to be any worse than what

23:53.917 --> 23:59.765
they were having to deal with when they dealt with 
the royal Lao government. But I basically felt

23:59.785 --> 24:12.401
like if the Lao weren't willing to do a better job of 
defending themselves, we couldn't do it for them.

24:13.843 --> 24:23.215
A lot of people spent time trying to propagandize 
and basically warn the Lao people what they could

24:13.843 --> 24:23.215
expect, and it just I guess, wasn't believed or 
people didn't care enough.

24:29.505 --> 24:33.491
So I sort of felt like, you know, the communists are 
going to take over. There's not much that can be

24:33.511 --> 24:35.814
done about it. And probably the best thing for all 
is just for the war to end as fast as possible. You

24:41.042 --> 24:45.207
know, put an end to the killing that was going on. 
There wasn't a lot of death in Laos because, as I've

24:45.247 --> 24:52.037
tried to indicate, though, the Lao went out of 
their way to fight, out of their way to avoid

24:52.355 --> 24:58.400
fighting the Vietnamese. And in a couple places I 
worked, the story was that the two sides sort of let

24:59.341 --> 25:19.239
one another know on what days they were going to be 
in certain areas, and that way the other side could

24:59.341 --> 25:19.239
avoid stumbling into that area and running across 
the other guys and then being forced into a

24:59.341 --> 25:19.239
firefight. And that Those, you know, again, I 
don't have any verification of this, but just kind

25:22.072 --> 25:40.091
of my feeling about people there and things that 
they said gave me the idea that those stories

25:22.072 --> 25:40.091
weren't too far-fetched, that people really 
weren't involved in the war. They were draft, you

25:40.171 --> 25:51.623
know, the vast majority of people were draftees 
into something they didn't give a damn about, and

25:40.171 --> 25:51.623
their main goal in life was to survive, you know, to 
avoid any kind of life-threatening situation

25:51.704 --> 25:59.753
that they could, and to get out of the military as 
fast as possible and go back to farming. So, you

26:02.055 --> 26:09.043
know, with those kinds of orientations, I mean, 
that's what they wanted. They wanted the war over

26:09.063 --> 26:16.671
with, and so I felt like the war ought to wind down as 
rapidly as possible. And it dragged on another...

26:20.645 --> 26:25.410
five years after I left, or four years, and then 
there was an armistice. In fact, I managed to go

26:26.051 --> 26:41.069
back in 1973, and there was kind of a rough peace, 
and I was actually able to travel to places on the

26:26.051 --> 26:41.069
ground, you know, in public transportation that 
I'd never been able to visit when I worked there

26:26.051 --> 26:41.069
officially. In such a fashion, I would have been 
shot, but under the circumstances, I was actually

26:41.829 --> 26:49.318
able to go about 100 miles into the jungle to some 
places I'd work, in effect by taxing.

27:00.134 --> 27:05.242
That

27:00.134 --> 27:05.242
is all the questions I have. Is there

27:05.262 --> 27:11.472
anything that we have not talked about that you'd 
like to talk about? Well, I can't think of

27:11.492 --> 27:14.116
anything. Oh, I wanted to mention something. My 
draft board was in Pasadena, California, which

27:17.041 --> 27:24.749
is, there are several places in California that 
are famous for their conservatism. Pasadena,

27:24.809 --> 27:26.971
California is one of them. That's where my draft 
board was located. And they had, as I said when we

27:29.814 --> 27:37.221
started, told me, no, sure, go off for two years and 
do your thing. You're going to have to come back

27:37.582 --> 27:42.086
after two years, and then you're going into the 
Army. But at the end of my two years, of course, the

27:44.048 --> 27:47.031
war was still going on, And so I asked to stay a third 
year. I knew that unless there was some kind of

27:53.082 --> 27:58.731
letter to my draft board, they were going to say, 
now you're done playing good guy. You've now got to

27:58.751 --> 28:07.224
do what everybody else of your age and sex does, and 
that's join the military. While I was working in an

28:07.244 --> 28:15.156
area, there were only two of us, and it was indeed a 
place that had once been in the hands of the

28:07.244 --> 28:15.156
communists. And so the guy that I worked for simply 
wrote a letter to my draft board saying that I was

28:17.183 --> 28:28.861
one of two young Americans living in an area 
recently taken out of the hands of the communists,

28:17.183 --> 28:28.861
and we were the only two representatives of the 
American government there. And I got a letter back

28:29.281 --> 28:35.491
from the draft board saying that I was permanently 
deferred. In other words, what in fact they were

28:35.891 --> 28:45.486
saying is that what you're doing is, as far as we're 
concerned, the equivalent of going to Vietnam And

28:46.259 --> 28:49.443
so stay there. We're not going to draft you. So I 
stayed another year. It turns out that right after

28:52.146 --> 28:56.091
that happened, we had to evacuate. The area was 
just too unsafe. And I worked in another place,

28:58.755 --> 29:07.005
which eventually became too unsafe and finally 
wound up in a city the last few months while I was

28:58.755 --> 29:07.005
there. And I guess that was it. Thank you very much 
for interviewing with me. You're welcome. I

29:13.212 --> 29:14.033
enjoyed it. I did, too.
