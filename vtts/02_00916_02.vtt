00:01.668 --> 00:05.954
The history of the island, there's probably good 
documentation of the history. But there's not

00:06.735 --> 00:10.920
much documentation of the government role in the 
history. The government just was not there. I

00:13.243 --> 00:14.505
mean, it was extremely corrupt. It was extremely 
non-professional until the late, late 50s or 60s.

00:21.494 --> 00:28.063
So you didn't have a situation like many other 
communities would have when it was more of a

00:21.494 --> 00:28.063
planning presence. Of course, the natural 
disaster they had there in the hurricane at the

00:28.043 --> 00:34.911
turn of the century was responsible for the 
seawall and some other things they did. It was also

00:34.931 --> 00:40.237
responsible for the demise of Galveston because 
the principal of Galveston never really

00:34.931 --> 00:40.237
recovered from that. They were the major city in 
Texas at that time. And after that hurricane, the

00:44.302 --> 00:52.532
damage and the deaths that resulted from that, 
investments didn't really come back to

00:44.302 --> 00:52.532
Galveston.

00:58.233 --> 01:02.539
Well, let's see if we can find some more things. How 
have the following influences affected planning

01:03.540 --> 01:07.565
in the community? Ethnic. Has there been much of an 
ethnic impact? Galveston's, well, ethnicity, if

01:12.652 --> 01:22.705
you look at race, for example, probably close to 
40% of Galveston is black. And it's, in a sense,

01:23.242 --> 01:29.610
almost a ghetto, because those people live in one 
small area in Galveston. And they're not spread

01:29.630 --> 01:30.731
out. To me, it was important to do the planning for 
those areas. We did have some areas that were low

01:35.297 --> 01:39.903
income that didn't necessarily have historical 
structures. The poverty level was such that those

01:41.305 --> 01:45.710
structures had long since been destroyed. And the 
historical value and ability to restore them

01:46.752 --> 01:51.898
didn't really exist.

01:52.874 --> 02:00.167
During the latter part of the time I was there, 
there was a kind of awakening in the black

01:52.874 --> 02:00.167
community to some extent. There was not much 
support for neighborhood planning at that time. I

02:04.815 --> 02:10.185
went into one of the more advanced higher income 
levels to do the first neighborhood plan, East End

02:04.815 --> 02:10.185
neighborhood. The second neighborhood was gonna 
be the black community. We did have a group come in

02:13.912 --> 02:17.498
and receive a grant. from the city under the 
Community Development Block Grant to do a

02:17.984 --> 02:24.392
neighborhood plan for one of the black 
neighborhoods. But that was done more as a

02:24.452 --> 02:27.316
political payoff. The manager told me, we need to 
support this group. And they need the money. And

02:33.103 --> 02:34.184
this is our way of showing it. Because they weren't 
competent. They weren't qualified to do it. And I

02:36.988 --> 02:40.732
was very disturbed and disappointed to see that 
money being wasted in it. In my way of thinking, the

02:40.752 --> 02:44.918
worst thing you can do is do a bad planning project. 
You're better off doing no planning project. That

02:47.768 --> 02:49.570
project eventually failed. The consultants did 
not produce a report. And the city staff had to come

02:51.772 --> 02:55.096
back in here and save that program. But a couple of 
people at that time brought in, gosh, I can't

02:55.116 --> 03:01.823
remember his name, from Cincinnati.

03:06.208 --> 03:07.229
Gosh, I can't remember his name. Very well known 
black man who had been able to revitalize part of

03:08.030 --> 03:16.999
Cincinnati. I wish I remember his name. I'm 
disappointed for not knowing that. He wanted to

03:23.932 --> 03:26.436
create a neighborhood housing service program. 
He wanted to kind of a bootstrap operation. And

03:29.721 --> 03:33.827
there were some people in the black community that 
were very sympathetic to what he had to say. And I

03:33.867 --> 03:39.136
think there was a renewal or an awakening of the 
political aspects of this. And a couple of, in

03:40.057 --> 03:44.404
fact, I think as I was leaving a black community, 
P.J. Thomas, maybe, I don't remember his name for

03:45.590 --> 03:53.100
sure, but a black man was appointed to our council, 
or our commission, rather. And now I understand

03:53.120 --> 04:00.070
there is a, last time I was down there in Galveston, 
one of the councilmen was black, and it used to be

03:53.120 --> 04:00.070
all Anglo, all male. And the first year I was down 
there, they had one woman in the council, and they

04:00.851 --> 04:14.610
now have a woman running for mayor at this time, who 
was a strong advocate of planning, that I knew when

04:00.851 --> 04:14.610
I was down there, she was one of the 
behind-the-scenes folks that I worked with and

04:00.851 --> 04:14.610
tried to give her ammunition to use in her 
interest. And she ran several years ago for

04:17.886 --> 04:20.989
council and was elected. She'll be a good mayor. 
But I think there was kind of an awakening there.

04:24.033 --> 04:25.755
The black community was almost invisible. It's 
hard to believe that with a population of that

04:25.955 --> 04:30.821
level that they would be invisible. But they were. 
They were visible politically. They were

04:33.785 --> 04:37.750
invisible in the culture and in the very life of the 
city. You didn't see black people in Galveston

04:37.830 --> 04:39.552
Island. You didn't see them on the beaches. You 
didn't see them in the stores and shops. I knew how

04:43.919 --> 04:48.225
many blacks there were supposed to be there from 
the census. But it didn't take me very long before I

04:48.245 --> 04:52.191
wondered where on earth they were at. You just did 
not see the minority community on that island when

04:52.211 --> 04:58.980
I was there. Well, why don't we take a divergence 
from

04:59.001 --> 05:08.414
Galveston and talk a little bit about Corpus 
Christi. Talk about Corpus. Corpus, you know, I

05:10.463 --> 05:16.669
hope in the oral histories here that somebody, and 
I assume they have it, talked to Bill Anderson. I

05:17.049 --> 05:19.271
got there just after Bill Anderson retired. One of 
the biggest disappointments in my life. One

05:22.614 --> 05:25.917
reason I had been going to Galveston was that he was 
down there. He was there for 25 years. It's a

05:29.180 --> 05:34.725
well-planned city because of that continued 
presence on his part there. I was hired as a senior

05:34.745 --> 05:36.506
planner. I had the responsibility for revising 
and updating their zoning ordinance. That was my

05:40.499 --> 05:42.540
initial responsibility. Simon Eisner, a 
national consultant, had been hired to draft, or

05:43.201 --> 05:52.430
really to analyze, the deficiencies in the city's 
zoning ordinance. It was a Harlem Bartholomew

05:52.450 --> 05:54.972
ordinance they had. And he reviewed it, produced 
an 80-, 90-page, 100-page report on changes that

05:56.193 --> 06:01.098
needed to be made. The city's strategy was to, 
rather than just make all those changes at one

06:01.578 --> 06:08.044
time, it was to work its way through those changes. 
Simon Eisner probably would have done that under

06:09.391 --> 06:29.419
his consulting agreement, but he had a running 
with the city manager, Marvin Townsend, at the

06:09.391 --> 06:29.419
council meeting where he, in essence, lectured 
the city manager for being rude and insensitive to

06:09.391 --> 06:29.419
the planning director at a public hearing. This is 
a unique situation. Marvin Townsend was a very

06:33.045 --> 06:38.993
strong, loyal city manager, ruled the city of 
Galveston with an iron fist, an iron hand, Bill

06:39.935 --> 06:49.732
Anderson, the planning director, was one of the 
few people who he did not control, who had some

06:39.935 --> 06:49.732
ability to have freedom to express themselves to 
the council. A sense of threat to the manager, if

06:51.214 --> 06:55.321
you wanted to look at it in a negative sense to him. 
But at one of the council meetings where Simon

06:55.341 --> 07:05.959
Eisner was in attendance presenting this 
ordinance, a planning matter came up and the

06:55.341 --> 07:05.959
planning director had spoken on something. 
Marvin Townsend got up and told the council that

07:06.277 --> 07:15.187
the planning director didn't know what he was 
talking about, that he was wrong in this matter,

07:06.277 --> 07:15.187
and he was really not paying attention to him. It 
was a real put-down. Well, at some time before that

07:17.349 --> 07:33.988
meeting was over, when Simon Eisner got up to talk 
about his consultant report, he proceeded to

07:17.349 --> 07:33.988
lecture the council and the manager about the 
impropriety of a manager saying the things he had

07:34.188 --> 07:40.796
said to the planning director, questioning the 
planning director's judgment in doing so in the

07:34.188 --> 07:40.796
situation that was done. Townsend

07:40.836 --> 07:49.687
didn't use a lot of tact in that kind of situation 
when he was dealing with this department here. And

07:50.228 --> 07:54.073
he publicly humiliated the planning director and 
chastised him. And Eisner just lectured down the

07:54.874 --> 07:59.740
city manager for having done that. Nobody talks 
like that to the city manager, to Marvin Townsend.

08:03.710 --> 08:09.858
So at the end of that meeting, Mr. Townsend, former 
planning director, that Mr. Eisner was no longer

08:03.710 --> 08:09.858
welcome at Corpus Christi. He didn't want to see 
his face again. And so that's why Simon Eisner

08:11.921 --> 08:13.643
never finished that. Well, anyway, I was hired. 
For about a year, I worked through some of these

08:15.405 --> 08:17.868
changes in the ordinance. We were able to make a 
good many of them. We had a 701 planning program. It

08:23.295 --> 08:24.276
was not doing well. The staff in charge of it really 
did not know what they were doing. And they were

08:28.622 --> 08:29.743
floundering. And the head of the program resigned 
and left. And at that point, then they asked me if I

08:36.500 --> 08:44.028
would be willing to do that job, run the 701 program 
as well as the zoning ordinance. And I was made to,

08:44.048 --> 08:47.372
at that time I was a senior planner. And I was senior 
planner in charge of research and development.

08:50.957 --> 08:53.760
And the research and development was supposed to 
be the zoning ordinance. But they expanded that to

08:53.780 --> 08:56.363
include the development of the comprehensive 
plan. So the next two years, two and a half years, I

09:00.824 --> 09:05.410
ran that program with three or four other staff 
people, and we produced a comprehensive plan. We

09:06.211 --> 09:23.954
produced a land use element, a park and open space 
element, a library facilities element,

09:06.211 --> 09:23.954
utilities element, school master plan elements,

09:06.211 --> 09:23.954
police facilities element, fire facilities 
element. Basically, we produced a series of

09:23.974 --> 09:28.620
independent reports that constituted a 
comprehensive plan. We did the economic

09:29.545 --> 09:33.871
determinants study. We did a physical 
determinants study. We did a social determinants

09:36.194 --> 09:37.356
study. These were all separate reports ranging 
from one to 200 pages in size. And then we produced

09:41.862 --> 09:45.226
all the elements of the plan. None of those 
planning elements were ever presented to the city

09:45.246 --> 09:55.160
council or the planning commission. They were 
very well known technically. The housing element

09:58.537 --> 10:07.549
was probably one of the most best illustrations, 
best examples of a comprehensive plan that I've

09:58.537 --> 10:07.549
ever been involved with. Bob Cornish had reviewed 
that with us and helped us as kind of a free advisor

10:07.569 --> 10:13.698
on certain parts of the plan. And we were 
developing what TJ Kent would call a unified

10:15.661 --> 10:25.354
summary, which was very innovative and was at the 
cutting edge of planning technology at that

10:25.739 --> 10:29.585
point. We satisfied the 701 requirements. HUD 
accepted those reports. We received probably

10:35.794 --> 10:44.788
$140,000 one year, $80,000 one year, maybe 
$250,000 in federal assistance to do those plans.

10:45.249 --> 10:47.492
It was quite substantial. Paid for these five 
staff people that worked on this plan and

10:47.933 --> 10:52.860
published and printed it. At the same time, I was 
involved superficially and peripherally with

10:53.583 --> 10:59.330
the Goals for Corpus Christi program. That was a 
two-year program that was run in the direction of

11:00.351 --> 11:06.338
John Lewis, who is now the executive director of 
Goals for Dallas. John had been a member of our

11:07.300 --> 11:08.982
planning staff. Outstanding goals program. 
Again, one of the most technically sound goals

11:11.344 --> 11:17.552
programs that I have ever read about in any 
literature anywhere. We had 10,000 to 12,000

11:18.313 --> 11:22.678
residents participate in the goals program. 
outstanding, I mean, an astounding, outstanding

11:23.165 --> 11:34.543
percentage, especially in light of the fact that 
we're in a bilingual community with 40, 45% of the

11:23.165 --> 11:34.543
community Mexican-American. So we had to do 
everything with that view in mind. We're also in a

11:37.287 --> 11:38.509
low-income area. Galveston-Corpus Christi was 
148th, I believe, in the SMSAs in per capita

11:38.569 --> 11:44.599
income. Both of those are usually impediments to 
citizen participation in the GOES program,

11:45.558 --> 11:51.865
outstanding GOES program. The city manager did 
not support that GOES program. The mayor did not

11:55.248 --> 11:58.612
support that GOES program. The response when the 
results of the program were presented to the

11:58.632 --> 12:08.583
council was great work, good try, too bad more 
people didn't participate so it would have been

11:58.632 --> 12:08.583
worthwhile. But it was worth a shot at it. It was too 
bad it failed. and they just swept it away in the

12:14.937 --> 12:20.905
closet. In essence, the city manager did the same 
thing in the comprehensive plan. He did not agree

12:24.050 --> 12:28.295
with the process that we used. He did not like 
policies. He was opposed to the use of principles,

12:31.440 --> 12:35.025
concepts, and standards. He was opposed to any 
analysis which suggested that there were

12:35.045 --> 12:41.113
deficiencies in the city of any type whatsoever. 
Probably going back, he was most opposed to the

12:41.684 --> 12:45.269
idea of the concept behind policies. He was not 
interested in the city council establishing

12:45.769 --> 12:48.193
policies. My negative biased assessment of it was 
that he saw this as a threat to his authority, his

12:49.274 --> 12:58.767
dominance over the council, his freedom to make 
decisions. He buried it. He boxed them up. They

13:01.851 --> 13:03.133
were put in a closet somewhere. And the last I heard 
was they might have even been burned. He was afraid

13:07.719 --> 13:10.763
they might following the public domain. Somebody 
might come in and find them or see them or whatever

13:12.785 --> 13:15.568
it is. But I will say in the two and a half years 
there, the plan that was produced was as

13:17.370 --> 13:30.446
technically as sound, maybe as good of an example 
of what a comprehensive plan ought to be and could

13:17.370 --> 13:30.446
be of anything I had seen. It was kind of the 
culmination of my career. I had done elements and

13:32.848 --> 13:40.277
components of plans in various cities and at 
various times, but never had I had the two and a half

13:32.848 --> 13:40.277
years to do all of the components for one 
community. And I was able to do that and able to

13:43.620 --> 14:06.670
apply some of the newer ideas about how to 
communicate, how to do a plan that was

13:43.620 --> 14:06.670
understandable, manageable, dealt with enough 
issues, but not too many issues, manageable in

13:43.620 --> 14:06.670
that sense, and put these plans together in a 
format where people could see these

13:43.620 --> 14:06.670
interrelationships and linkages between these 
elements. which is a challenge to us. It's a

14:08.660 --> 14:11.622
challenge I'm not sure the profession has been 
able to respond to. Technically, it was just

14:12.944 --> 14:14.465
outstanding. You know, it just destroyed me to 
have to walk away from it and to see it not be

14:14.485 --> 14:19.470
accepted. But I recognized I had to do that. The man 
who was city manager, the man who is manager, is

14:21.812 --> 14:25.716
boss. And he was the boss, and he was opposed to 
these things. I think the most disappointing

14:28.559 --> 14:34.885
thing was that toward the last year I worked in that 
program, I had asked not to do it. because of some of

14:35.084 --> 14:42.194
the rejections I received from him on earlier 
elements, I had tried to get off of that and say,

14:35.084 --> 14:42.194
hey, let someone else do this. Or let's not do these 
elements, because the manager doesn't want them.

14:46.680 --> 14:47.561
And this is a mistake. And the planning director, 
who at that time was

14:48.222 --> 14:57.294
Larry Winger was, in essence, the assistant 
director. Gosh, I can't remember his name. It's a

15:01.280 --> 15:03.623
Mexican-American fellow who was the planning 
director. And he met with the manager, and the

15:04.396 --> 15:08.662
manager was adamant that he wanted a plan. He would 
use the plan. And I had given him an outline of what

15:11.406 --> 15:14.951
the plan was, and he was committing to that 
outline. And I told the planning director, I said,

15:14.971 --> 15:21.780
from my discussions I've had with the manager 
earlier here, this does not represent what he

15:14.971 --> 15:21.780
wants to do. This is a mistake to do a plan like this. 
And the planning director said, no, he was... He

15:32.442 --> 15:33.223
was committed to it. He wanted to do it. He wanted 
that plan. And so we did it. And that was a profit

15:38.131 --> 15:40.395
fulfilled, unfortunately. The manager came back 
and reacted exactly like I knew he would do.

15:46.625 --> 15:46.825
Okay. Okay. Well, thank you very much. All right.
