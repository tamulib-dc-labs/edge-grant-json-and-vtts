WEBVTT

00:01.313 --> 00:04.537
students and professors back in the early 1920s? 
Well, I think we had lots of, there was lots more

00:04.658 --> 00:09.684
personal contact. You knew them much more 
intimately, and they knew the students

00:10.606 --> 00:18.857
intimately. There was, now there's so many that 
it's

00:18.917 --> 00:26.427
come more difficult to know much about your 
students. At least it was getting that way when I

00:33.146 --> 00:37.211
wound up out there. And I think probably

00:38.733 --> 00:53.190
back yonder we had much more respect for our 
instructors and professors than they have now.

00:54.132 --> 00:56.575
because, well, it's just the trend of the times. I 
guess they don't have the respect for the parents

00:56.695 --> 00:59.778
that they used to have. That is— So you think that 
your idea then is that this is a generalization

01:00.699 --> 01:08.187
from the home? Yeah, that's right. Do you think 
there's other factors why they don't seem to have

01:12.472 --> 01:19.600
more or as much respect today for their professors 
as they used to?

01:23.258 --> 01:30.284
Well, I think they're taught children these days 
are more or less trained not to have too much

01:23.258 --> 01:30.284
respect.

01:32.846 --> 01:35.849
We never thought of calling anybody by their first 
name. You never thought of calling a professor by

01:37.571 --> 01:40.193
his first name? Yes. And if he had a title, we used 
that. But now they'll introduce any old

01:45.457 --> 01:51.763
gray-headed guy as Joe Bloke. There

01:53.279 --> 02:09.060
seems to be a feeling of equality that didn't used 
to exist.

02:13.495 --> 02:23.528
You can go to some of the Latin country and Mexico's 
and they have much more respect down there when

02:13.495 --> 02:23.528
they're addressing people like that. I was 
wondering about just out of class relations

02:25.730 --> 02:33.120
between students and professors also back in the 
early 1920s. Did you ever have any social events

02:34.221 --> 02:37.285
with professors? Did people ever get together and 
Oh, have intramural softball games or, I don't

02:40.141 --> 02:46.487
know, drink a beer together or anything like that. 
No. No, they didn't. Now, with small departments,

02:49.350 --> 03:08.848
sometimes the department head would have the 
seniors in for supper, for dinner sometime before

02:49.350 --> 03:08.848
they graduated, but there'd be maybe not more than 
a dozen sometimes three or four, depending on the

03:09.065 --> 03:15.051
size of the senior class in that particular 
department. But, and a lot of the, sometimes

03:16.492 --> 03:33.328
they'd have, well, the students would have RV ball 
and senior ball and all that sort of stuff, and a

03:16.492 --> 03:33.328
good many of the professors would come to that if 
they cared to. They were certainly invited. But as

03:37.191 --> 03:38.953
far as Well, we didn't have any beer joints around 
here then. Nobody was doing prohibition. That's

03:46.493 --> 03:47.856
absolutely right. So there wasn't any, because 
Cindy had no fraternizing of that type during that

03:49.037 --> 03:55.728
time. Okay. Let's move on to talk about 
personalities here for a moment. Of course, the

04:05.663 --> 04:12.489
most predominant personality at the time is Dr. 
Mark Francis, and he was your professor. Would you

04:14.090 --> 04:15.231
describe him? What kind of character was he?

04:23.218 --> 04:34.527
Well, he was very pleasant, and he was hard of 
hearing, so you didn't talk to him. He did the

04:34.547 --> 04:35.468
talking. Oh,

04:35.617 --> 04:40.886
I see. And he just carried on from there, but he was 
very pleasant, a little short fella, always in a

04:40.906 --> 04:59.278
hurry, and a wonderful lecturer.

05:02.515 --> 05:05.918
He wasn't a taskmaster. What do you mean? He didn't 
give you any homework or many quizzes or anything

05:10.984 --> 05:15.929
of that nature. He gave you the lectures and you're 
supposed to remember it, and that was it. So he

05:23.396 --> 05:29.923
wasn't hard in that respect, but He did a wonderful 
job of preparing the cadavers for dissection.

05:39.950 --> 05:55.825
Probably did too good a job, made it too easy, 
because he'd inject the veins with one color of

05:39.950 --> 05:55.825
blue plastiparas, and he'd inject the arteries 
with red, and then you could just follow them out.

05:57.327 --> 06:00.450
Whereas ordinarily, you just have a collapsed 
blood vessel there and you have to figure out what

06:01.122 --> 06:05.668
it is. But his were easy to follow out and dissect.

06:17.003 --> 06:18.025
They did a good job.

06:24.273 --> 06:28.699
Dr. Dunn, as far as his lectures were concerned, He 
gave the best lecture of anyone in the veterinary

06:29.810 --> 06:35.875
school, best organized. And he'd have it boiled 
down to essentials. Good speaker? Good speaker,

06:43.642 --> 06:46.625
yes. And he was great. What kind of man was he? What 
do you mean, what kind of man? Well, I mean, could

06:54.372 --> 06:55.994
you describe him? Well, he was very pleasant. He 
was short,

07:00.708 --> 07:19.138
not very tall, he was a little taller than Dr. 
Francis and rather stout and

07:00.708 --> 07:19.138
well he was very pleasant. How about Grady? How was 
he on Grady? Could you compare him with Dr. Francis

07:22.884 --> 07:25.669
on Grady? Oh yes, he was better at that than Dr. 
Francis. Better in which way? In that he'd give you

07:33.836 --> 07:38.101
a little more, work you a little more. Oh, I see.

07:43.428 --> 07:51.117
You'd have to work a little harder to earn your 
grade from him.

07:56.463 --> 07:58.025
Dr. Leonard was a great man.

08:00.969 --> 08:08.940
He was, if anything, he was too modest to get 
national recognition. He was a better, I'd say,

08:10.321 --> 08:25.862
surgeon in many respects than lots of the people 
that wrote textbooks, but he wasn't interested in

08:10.321 --> 08:25.862
that sort of thing, in recognition. He wanted to do 
his job, and he was an excellent surgeon. So he

08:33.684 --> 08:35.367
taught the course on surgery? Eventually. Now Dr. 
Marsteller did first, and then Dr. Leonard did.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.432
Could you talk about Dr. Marsteller? Dr. 
Marsteller was, he was a peculiar sort of

08:52.707 --> 08:58.313
individual.

09:02.057 --> 09:03.258
He'd try to make you mad. To get you to do things, 
respond.

09:14.549 --> 09:16.792
How would he try to get you mad? Could you give me an 
example? I can't give you an example, but He'd make

09:23.673 --> 09:27.459
you do things that were useless.

09:31.104 --> 09:36.331
Just menial things to knock you down. And

09:38.354 --> 09:51.874
he was worse with his student labor and his 
secretaries that way than he was with the

09:38.354 --> 09:51.874
students, I guess, that he taught.

09:53.525 --> 09:55.547
and he was always collecting things. At one time 
they were feeding hogs the garbage from the mess

09:57.809 --> 10:23.515
hall and he had the project and he'd have a man going 
through all that garbage, getting all the forks

09:57.809 --> 10:23.515
and spoons and things that had been thrown in the 
garbage And he had a room and he had them all stuck

10:24.136 --> 10:27.920
away there. And he had all kinds of junk around.

10:36.869 --> 10:44.977
They told a story one time that he was going across 
the campus and he saw a wheelbarrow out there. He

10:45.938 --> 10:47.800
said, somebody's going to steal that. So he threw 
it in his car and took it down there and put it in the

10:48.641 --> 10:54.126
basement of the veterinary hospital. Probably

10:54.781 --> 11:01.830
belonged to some maintenance man. Probably did. 
But he didn't think somebody was going to steal

11:04.433 --> 11:10.300
that, and so he took it. But he was always, he'd have 
workmen that gathered lumber, and he'd have them

11:10.320 --> 11:24.197
knocking the nails out and straightening the 
nails.

11:25.004 --> 11:36.974
He was, I don't know what it is, what kind of quirk 
you'd call it,

11:25.004 --> 11:36.974
he just couldn't stand it and see anything go to 
waste. And

11:39.276 --> 11:45.822
he was always doing something like that.

11:49.545 --> 11:54.589
But he was generous at his If you went out with him, 
if you were doing something with him, or you went on

11:55.210 --> 12:03.788
a call with him, or went on a trip with him, he'd pay 
everything. He was generous, but he couldn't

12:05.712 --> 12:12.105
stand to see junk go to waste.

12:15.376 --> 12:19.941
Maybe he was melting all that silver down and 
cashing it in. Now it would be quite valuable

12:19.981 --> 12:21.643
today. I don't know what became of all that stuff. I 
guess they threw it away when they tore the old

12:26.828 --> 12:30.692
veterinary hospital down.

12:34.757 --> 12:37.880
The old veterinary hospital was a little frame 
building.

12:41.584 --> 12:42.345
It was

12:47.911 --> 13:07.468
Well there's a little building there and

12:47.911 --> 13:07.468
at the end of it by there used to be a museum and 
originally that was the whole cholera laboratory

12:47.911 --> 13:07.468
and the old veterinary hospital was just the other 
side of that not too far from there.

13:14.414 --> 13:17.817
I'm still interested in Dr. Francis do you Have any 
more thoughts on him?

13:24.748 --> 13:28.094
Well, he was always, he was very observant. He 
didn't miss anything. As I say, he did the talking.

13:34.383 --> 13:41.754
I remember I was going to one cold morning, must 
have been about this time of year, frost was on the

13:34.383 --> 13:41.754
ground. And I was living over in what they called 
Beta Hall then. There were two frame buildings

13:49.488 --> 14:02.865
that used to be, well at one time they were kind of 
hotels, and then they made them into dormitories

13:49.488 --> 14:02.865
for civilian students. I'd graduated, so I was 
living in Beta Hall, and I was going to the, over to

14:02.885 --> 14:15.360
anatomy, and the anatomy building is, was there by

14:18.023 --> 14:22.169
close to the textile building, if you know where 
the textile building is. Anyway, there was a water

14:23.511 --> 14:29.360
tower there, a great big water tower. That's not 
there anymore. And this boy had jumped off the

14:32.145 --> 14:39.215
water tower during the night, and he was laying 
there, had frost on him. Dr. Francis came out of the

14:39.336 --> 14:44.183
anatomy building, came over and looked at him, 
Says, huh, bad medicine, one drop to the dose.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.695
And he had lots of expressions like that. If he 
wanted to talk about somebody who was pompous,

14:55.957 --> 15:09.681
he'd say, Colonel Big Belly came along on his horse

14:55.957 --> 15:09.681
and never batted an eye on him. But he had lots of... 
He had a good sense of humor. Oh, yeah, wonderful.

15:14.397 --> 15:17.261
And he had lots of little expressions like that. I 
remember one time we were in anatomy there. He was

15:21.045 --> 15:23.228
skeleton of the horse. He had a skeleton of a horse 
there. And he was talking about the joints,

15:26.852 --> 15:31.037
different joints. And then he got to the hip joint. 
He looked at the thing. He kind of closed his eyes

15:35.162 --> 15:39.887
and pointed, and he said, Ha! That's one place 
where the good Lord could have made an

15:40.846 --> 15:43.871
improvement. That's the hip joint. So he was 
sharp. Gee, he was sharp. I remember he was always

15:55.308 --> 16:03.320
collecting mastodon bones and whatnot. And he had 
this skeleton, not a skeleton, but a skull. I guess

16:09.466 --> 16:11.389
it must have been of a mastodon. It was about that 
behind. And he had all the parts of it. And he

16:19.744 --> 16:25.595
brought a man in from New York or somewhere to put it 
together for him. And the guy was standing there

16:25.615 --> 16:29.061
and he had this little piece of bone and he was 
looking at it and looking at the skull. Dr. Francis

16:33.193 --> 16:35.956
came sashaying by there. He says, hop, I think 
you'll find that goes here. Oh,

16:39.241 --> 16:44.647
he was sharp.

16:47.171 --> 16:48.672
Students must have liked him then. Oh yeah, they 
loved him.

16:52.958 --> 16:57.023
He was hard of hearing and lots of times his classes 
were pretty noisy. Could he answer questions or

16:58.049 --> 17:03.158
was he too hard of hearing to hear questions? He 
didn't ask questions. Oh you didn't ask questions

17:05.782 --> 17:08.707
in his class? He covered everything. Oh I see.

17:17.081 --> 17:22.150
I know you were a student then and he was the 
administrator but did Did it seem like, from the

17:22.433 --> 17:29.542
student's angle, that the job of administration 
was well done?

17:34.629 --> 17:38.374
Yes, as far as we could tell, administration was 
all right. He didn't like administration. I don't

17:41.799 --> 17:50.230
think he liked going up there with the brass to the 
academic council meetings and things. But yes, he

17:52.167 --> 17:55.751
was a good administrator.

18:00.256 --> 18:07.003
Okay, let's turn to

18:00.256 --> 18:07.003
the vet program itself when you were there. What 
did you think, did you think that there were some

18:07.043 --> 18:16.133
particularly strong points of the program when 
you went through and some that were weak?

18:22.340 --> 18:26.847
I think the strongest parts were over in the 
clinical subjects.

18:33.257 --> 18:49.461
You know, clinical subjects and

18:33.257 --> 18:49.461
in the practice.

18:51.601 --> 18:56.188
In other words, training the students for field 
work. Yes. That's probably, I think, one of the

18:57.550 --> 19:01.436
strongest points. But it's hard to compare it 
because you had these other basic courses that you

19:02.037 --> 19:09.788
had to have before you got to that. And if you didn't 
understand them, well, you didn't understand

19:11.270 --> 19:17.760
your clinical work.

19:23.613 --> 19:29.804
but I think they were all pretty strong when I was 
there. You felt when you left in 1926 to go into

19:30.225 --> 19:39.682
private practice in New Orleans that you had been 
well trained? Yes.

19:43.168 --> 19:48.237
Now you left in 1926 and then you returned in 1937, 
11 years. You must have, when you came back, you

19:48.503 --> 19:52.687
must have noticed a few changes. Could you 
describe those?

19:59.614 --> 20:10.364
Well, it was lots of, as far as the physical plant 
was concerned, they had done lots of building

19:59.614 --> 20:10.364
during the Depression. See, I wasn't there during 
the Depression. Right, right, I know. Then they

20:16.567 --> 20:37.956
had all those public works jobs, and they put up a 
lot of good buildings and laboratories, so the

20:16.567 --> 20:37.956
facilities were much improved

20:16.567 --> 20:37.956
from what they were when I was in school.

20:41.401 --> 20:46.067
And, well, everything had gotten It really got 
bigger. It just seemed like there was more

20:48.543 --> 20:51.386
students. There were more students and more 
buildings and better buildings. Larger

20:57.632 --> 20:58.953
curriculum maybe?

21:05.280 --> 21:07.922
You mean college-wise, university-wise? No, in 
the School of Vet Medicine. I think curriculum was

21:12.026 --> 21:14.569
just about the same.

21:24.995 --> 21:26.297
We didn't have enough teachers. I know that. Heck, 
I taught all kinds of courses there. I taught a

21:32.144 --> 21:35.368
little of everything. Not a little of everything, 
but I assisted many of them and taught courses

21:35.768 --> 21:48.524
for medicine and surgery that were not. See, I came 
there in veterinary hygiene, what they called

21:48.544 --> 21:53.871
veterinary hygiene. They had never had a 
department for that, and I had to work up something

21:54.172 --> 22:23.014
for

21:54.172 --> 22:23.014
that department, but I also taught 
non-infectious diseases for medicine and

21:54.172 --> 22:23.014
surgery and obstetrics, and I assisted with 
surgery, and

21:54.172 --> 22:23.014
I just filled in where they needed. You

22:24.379 --> 22:41.315
went into private practice in 1926. Instead of 
going to work for the government, you went over to

22:41.495 --> 22:47.581
New Orleans. That's right. Why did you accept that 
job? looking for some way to get enough money to

22:52.728 --> 23:02.980
eat, and they

22:52.728 --> 23:02.980
were looking for a man.

23:05.944 --> 23:14.774
I guess Dr. Marsteller must have asked me if I 
wanted to go over there, and he loaned me $50 to get

23:05.944 --> 23:14.774
there on. I didn't have any money. So, yes. So I went 
to New Orleans and was with that firm there,

23:21.652 --> 23:32.667
McLean, Carson, Dyke, and Chapman,

23:21.652 --> 23:32.667
for about four months, I guess. Then I went to, Dr. 
Burns had been in Beaumont with Dr. Kerr, and he

23:33.548 --> 23:44.243
left to come to A&M, I guess, to teach. And I guess he 
wrote me. He wanted to know if I wanted to come

23:48.489 --> 23:50.832
there, and I did. And so I worked for Dr. Kerr and 
became partner with him until I came to A&M in 1937.

24:03.839 --> 24:09.886
Now when you were in private practice,

24:03.839 --> 24:09.886
basically what were your duties? Were they small 
animals yet? I did mostly the small animals, that

24:13.109 --> 24:18.996
is when I was with Dr. Kerr, mostly small animals 
and he did the large animals. I stayed in the

24:20.073 --> 24:23.038
hospital, and he made the calls. Because you were 
in an urban setting. Was this the time when more and

24:26.603 --> 24:31.691
more people would bring in their house pets? Yeah. 
During the 1920s? Yeah, well, it was picking up,

24:34.035 --> 24:36.819
yes. That's right. It was just, this is the time 
when house pets were starting to pick up. Yeah, and

24:43.810 --> 24:45.372
then the crash came. Yeah, yeah. I'd like to talk 
about what was it like to be a veterinarian in

24:46.676 --> 24:52.886
private practice during the Great Depression? It 
was tough going, and you did anything to get a

24:54.348 --> 25:02.941
little extra money. One summer, I worked for the 
government on a drought relief program. On what

25:07.969 --> 25:08.590
relief? Drought relief. They'd had a big drought 
down here in South Texas. And I was down there

25:15.292 --> 25:18.757
buying cattle.

25:21.761 --> 25:31.375
And then when I came back to Beaumont from that, 
when that job played out, I came back, of course,

25:21.761 --> 25:31.375
with Dr. Curry. We stayed partners. And I went to 
work for the city of Beaumont on meat and milk

25:34.719 --> 25:40.367
inspections. And then after work hours, I'd go 
down to the hospital, and on Saturdays and

25:42.406 --> 25:57.045
Sundays, I'd work there at the hospital taking 
care of small animals, helping Dr. Kirk. Were

25:59.207 --> 26:02.532
there a lot of people who just couldn't pay the 
bill?

26:05.816 --> 26:09.200
Well, there were a lot of people that didn't pay 
their bill. It was hard. Yes, you had lots of debt

26:10.282 --> 26:12.244
accounts. Did the number of small pets and small 
animals, because of the Depression, because it

26:13.962 --> 26:26.416
was so hard to get food, were the number of small 
animals declining? Yes, it did decline. And so

26:29.980 --> 26:32.383
your business in general then was probably 
declined. Yeah, that's why I went to work for the

26:32.403 --> 26:33.684
city. Yeah, right, right, right. There wasn't 
enough there for both of us. Your income then

26:39.811 --> 26:41.012
dropped. Sure.

26:49.889 --> 26:58.600
Of course, the money that, I was still a partner 
with Dr. Kerr, and what I got from the city, I went

26:49.889 --> 26:58.600
into the general pot there at the hospital. Oh, 
really? Oh, really? And so you weren't full-time

27:00.502 --> 27:02.145
then? I was full-time with the city, but I'd come 
after, at 5 o'clock, I'd go to the hospital and work

27:02.906 --> 27:12.137
there, and on Saturdays and Sundays. Well, what 
were the duties of, your title was city

27:14.380 --> 27:18.105
veterinarian, wasn't it? Yeah. What were your 
duties there? Well it was mostly, it was mostly

27:20.745 --> 27:44.112
milk hygiene, inspecting dairies and 
creameries, that sort of thing, and taking care of

27:20.745 --> 27:44.112
any problems there that turned up at the abattoir, 
the slaughterhouse, and Well lots of times other

27:45.948 --> 27:48.973
things had come up. I can remember one time they had 
a case of typhoid. These people were

27:52.238 --> 27:59.531
isolated for typhoid and they couldn't pick up the 
milk bottles there. So they had a room full of milk

28:00.432 --> 28:04.338
bottles when the thing was over. So I had to go over 
there and supervise the disinfecting of all that

28:05.140 --> 28:12.512
stuff.

28:12.762 --> 28:15.526
So different things that come up in the health 
department. Yeah, I think that would broaden your

28:15.666 --> 28:18.570
background. Oh yeah, it did.

28:24.318 --> 28:29.705
And then in the evenings after you were done with 
that, then you'd go back to the veterinary

28:24.318 --> 28:29.705
hospital. Yeah, and if there was anything to do, 
I'd take care of it. How'd you get this Job City vet?

28:41.585 --> 28:43.447
Well, they were looking for a man.

28:47.032 --> 28:51.818
The one they had, let's see, Ward, T. Ward, I guess, 
left there. He was the man just ahead of me. And they

28:56.223 --> 29:02.651
were looking for a man, so I went over and talked to 
him about getting a job with him. A man by the name of

29:02.671 --> 29:08.098
Cole was mayor then, had a lumber yard. I went to 
talk to him, and then went to talk to the city

29:10.255 --> 29:15.984
manager. They needed someone, so I got the job.

29:24.818 --> 29:28.725
I tried to get it on a part-time basis, but they 
wanted a full-time man.

29:31.669 --> 29:35.115
So, that's the way we did it. In 1937, you were 
appointed head to a newly established department

29:36.563 --> 29:42.970
of veterinary and hygiene. Why'd they pick you? 
Well, there again, I don't know. They were looking

29:48.215 --> 29:52.560
for a man for someone. I can't tell you because Dr. 
Francis had died, and Dr. Marsteller was dean, and

29:53.240 --> 30:06.334
he'd gone to Europe, and they were looking for a man 
And I guess Dr. Burns, Pat Burns, must have

30:06.736 --> 30:16.110
contacted me. And I came up here and talked to him. 
And

30:22.159 --> 30:28.369
I can't remember any other details. I guess they 
sent me a, must have sent me a letter. stating what

30:36.115 --> 30:42.761
my salary would be and whatnot and whatnot.

30:42.781 --> 30:43.502
Why'd you take it? Shoot, that was during the 
Depression. Well, I know, but you had a job during

30:48.607 --> 30:52.070
the Depression. Why'd you decide to change? Well, 
we were splitting up down there. There was two of us

31:00.018 --> 31:02.220
living off of that. And there'd just be... me and my 
wife living off of this and up here, so it looked

31:04.617 --> 31:11.045
like a better opportunity. Were you rather 
nostalgic about the thought of coming back to

31:11.786 --> 31:19.936
Texas A&M? Well, yes. I loved the place, and I had 
kept up with it pretty well, had lots of friends

31:22.839 --> 31:33.072
here, So I was glad to come back.

31:46.060 --> 31:47.982
And here I'm still here. Still in Bryan now. I never 
go on the campus much anymore. Too many people, too

31:54.510 --> 31:57.533
many automobiles.

32:00.336 --> 32:04.341
And I don't really have any business up there, 
except visit.

32:07.122 --> 32:08.547
I know very few people now.

32:11.737 --> 32:19.140
So many new people have come in and there's been 
such a turnover that I've just lost my contacts out

32:11.737 --> 32:19.140
there to a large extent.
