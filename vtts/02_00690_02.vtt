WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:07.358
That data was coming in and I thought it was being 
analyzed and we haven't... Oh, you don't have it

00:01.330 --> 00:07.358
for the earlier ones either. So I don't have a good 
perspective. I've glanced at it, but in a raw form.

00:12.766 --> 00:17.492
Roughly though, about 40% of our people are going 
in and teaching. But that's of those who plan to go

00:17.592 --> 00:19.835
in and teach. Now of those who... Of all of our 
graduates, about 40% of them will be teacher

00:19.895 --> 00:26.965
preparation graduates. Of those... it's looking 
like maybe 60% of them are going into teaching.

00:33.805 --> 00:34.806
Well, that's kind of bad. It's not bad, and I'm not 
sure of that number. Well, I wonder because, you

00:38.090 --> 00:56.792
know, like I said, I'm hearing so many different 
versions of, you know, the numbers and because of

00:38.090 --> 00:56.792
teacher shortages, and now what is this going to do 
to us, this new, if the whole teacher preparation,

00:38.090 --> 00:56.792
how is that going to affect your department if this 
goes into effect, this five-year program and all

00:38.090 --> 00:56.792
that other good stuff? Yeah, that's... That has 
really got us in a dither right now. Dean Corrigan

01:02.743 --> 01:09.533
obviously wants it to happen, and every way we turn 
it, it looks like it's bad for us. Really? It's bad

01:10.375 --> 01:12.277
for several departments, is it not? I mean, some of 
them more so than others. I mean, that's what I'm

01:14.220 --> 01:15.542
hearing from others. I'm sure everyone thinks 
that. Well, who is it good for then? And why are we

01:21.812 --> 01:23.073
doing it? It's good if this could come about, if. If 
we, in fact, did begin to prepare lead teachers,

01:28.017 --> 01:48.844
teachers who are obviously better prepared than 
other schools who are not doing it, and if, and both

01:28.017 --> 01:48.844
of these pieces are absolutely essential, and if 
the public schools recognize that and pay this

01:28.017 --> 01:48.844
according, then it would be good. Because we need 
research schools who are preparing one level of

01:48.904 --> 01:55.813
teaching, and other types of schools are 
preparing another level. Dean Corrigan's

01:56.198 --> 02:03.608
position is that you've got to decide who comes 
first, the chicken or the egg, and no one knows. So

02:04.550 --> 02:13.842
what he's decided to do is push to prepare the egg, 
and then we'll see if the chicken follows. That's

02:13.862 --> 02:17.267
probably an oversimplification of his position. 
It's scary, I think it is. We've gone to a

02:20.371 --> 02:24.417
nine-semester curriculum two years ago, That's 
one semester past normal graduation. So it

02:29.931 --> 02:35.075
wouldn't be that hard for us to go another semester 
to have a five-year program. But it depends on how

02:35.095 --> 02:39.239
you let us look when we do that. What we're talking 
about now is graphically different than what

02:40.300 --> 02:46.225
we've got in place now. I think we'll turn out a 
poorer product in our field. I think the product

02:50.369 --> 02:52.371
will be poorer. I know that our master's people 
will be poorer. I thought it would not affect us.

02:59.102 --> 03:00.404
Oh, the master's, okay. Because right now you have 
a totally separate or different type of master's

03:00.484 --> 03:03.829
program. Our master's program will be this 
particular master's, the master of education,

03:03.989 --> 03:11.159
will be EDCI, basically. That makes EDCI program 
stronger, but it doesn't do anything for a health

03:12.401 --> 03:16.566
educator. A health educator would be stronger in 
pedagogy, but not stronger in health education.

03:23.216 --> 03:24.998
Now, I don't object to that because a lot of our 
people do that anyway. A lot of our health

03:28.930 --> 03:38.099
education majors and physical education majors 
get a baccalaureate degree with us and then get

03:28.930 --> 03:38.099
their masters in EDCM or Ed Psych or someplace 
else. But they make that choice. Under this

03:40.281 --> 03:43.024
system, everybody would do that. And I'm not sure 
that's good. Do you still require or do you require

03:44.005 --> 03:50.071
of your student teachers the same as the college 
does, a whole semester? Yes, that's correct.

03:50.692 --> 03:51.693
That's pretty much. That's correct. Okay. Any 
type of insights or anecdotes or observations and

03:55.522 --> 04:07.984
things that might be, that would not be in any 
documents, that are just from your own vantage

03:55.522 --> 04:07.984
point of where you've sat these last few years? I 
had trouble with that when I read it the first time

04:10.628 --> 04:13.132
through. Well, I think... One thing that happened 
that's in light of what we were just talking about

04:13.193 --> 04:21.006
is when I came here in 1972, We were knee-deep in 
something called performance-based teacher

04:22.235 --> 04:26.559
education. Remember that? PBTE. Texas Education 
Agency had just decreed that every school, every

04:29.983 --> 04:38.871
college preparation program would have to go to a 
PBTE type of program. Now, being a junior faculty

04:38.891 --> 04:42.895
member, I didn't get involved in a lot of the 
committee work. And being a first-year junior

04:42.956 --> 04:45.938
faculty member, especially. But I watched my 
colleagues just work themselves silly trying to

04:45.958 --> 04:49.542
get all that done. And then about the time they were 
almost ready to put in place, suddenly it was gone.

04:55.779 --> 05:00.065
And that is something that I worry about in terms of 
9-94. All these personnel that are going into this

05:00.606 --> 05:09.099
planning, and the whole thing could change in the 
next legislature just overnight. That's by way of

05:09.119 --> 05:12.123
an antidote, I guess, but I'm not sure. What was the 
base, because I wasn't really in education that

05:12.343 --> 05:18.853
much at the time, the performance base, what was 
the the major thrust of that movement? Well, the

05:23.007 --> 05:31.378
idea was that you were going to give paramount 
attention to the performance. What are your

05:32.119 --> 05:33.862
performance objectives? Okay, yeah. And 
everybody was going to have to describe in

05:35.164 --> 05:41.392
performance objectives what attention... Not 
necessarily wrong, wasn't it? It wasn't

05:41.412 --> 05:43.875
necessarily a bad idea. But unfortunately, a lot 
of the things that are valuable... this is my

05:48.415 --> 05:56.585
opinion, but a lot of people who, a lot of things 
that are valuable cannot be reduced to a

05:48.415 --> 05:56.585
performance-based objective. And a lot of it was 
performance rather than knowledge-based. It

06:00.629 --> 06:08.538
was, you're talking about, can you do this, can you 
do that, and can you perform

06:00.629 --> 06:08.538
that? It's a good idea, and it moved us forward, I 
think, in our thinking, in teacher education and

06:08.599 --> 06:16.227
in education in general. But when you When you try 
to make the whole world at one way, it's a good case

06:17.913 --> 06:25.725
of trying to make the whole world at one way. Could 
you give me a very brief profile of your students as

06:25.745 --> 06:31.114
they come in? And do you have a lot of them that start 
in as freshmen? Because overall in the college,

06:33.818 --> 06:39.567
the freshman class is considerably smaller than 
what that same class graduates Is that true in your

06:39.698 --> 06:41.180
department? Do you have a lot of transfer ends? We 
mimic the college almost verbatim, maybe even

06:42.663 --> 06:47.590
more so. We will have very few intern freshmen. 
We're trying to turn that around. We've got about a

06:53.940 --> 07:06.820
half million dollars' worth of scholarships 
available, and we would like to use those

06:53.940 --> 07:06.820
scholarship dollars to attract incoming 
freshmen. But I don't think we want to be

07:07.576 --> 07:09.859
successful, frankly. This school, you know, 
unless it changes drastically, is an

07:10.620 --> 07:18.412
engineering, business, agriculture school. And 
90% of the students who come here, initially come

07:18.432 --> 07:25.622
here, to major in one of those fields. And it's 
because of their parents, or who knows why, but

07:25.642 --> 07:30.729
they all come for those reasons. And then after 
they've been here a while, and demonstrated to

07:30.749 --> 07:35.997
their parents that this is not for me, or 
demonstrate to themselves this is not for me. Then

07:39.050 --> 07:43.175
they began to look around at where they really 
wanted to be all along. And I think that's probably

07:43.195 --> 07:50.702
true in my field anyway.

07:50.722 --> 08:03.115
Health education and physical education have 
never been the prestige academic programs of

07:50.722 --> 08:03.115
choice anyway, though we were in them. I think so, 
but I didn't start it. I was going to be a

08:05.308 --> 08:08.392
pharmacist. I was going to be a pharmacist because 
I heard they made a lot of money and it was a good job.

08:13.218 --> 08:16.683
But that wasn't at all what I wanted to do. And so I 
went for a semester or two in a pre-pharmacy type

08:16.983 --> 08:28.177
program until I finally decided happiness was 
equally as important as money. And I think that

08:28.197 --> 08:32.983
happens in our field more than even in education, 
but it's happening in education as well. More and

08:33.183 --> 08:34.084
more and more. And has the quality of the student 
changed in your department as much as it has in the

08:35.246 --> 08:40.053
overall college? I don't know in the overall 
college, but our quality has gone up every year

08:40.113 --> 08:45.701
since I've been here. We get an excellent student, 
just an excellent student. One of the things

08:50.648 --> 08:59.120
that's happened, and not since I've been here, but 
it's happened to our field, is that we're no longer

08:50.648 --> 08:59.120
the major choice for the athlete. And I'm not sure. 
down on athletics. I have an athletic background

09:03.100 --> 09:04.982
of my own. I believe very strongly in that. In 
athletics, I think it's important, but that's not

09:08.025 --> 09:12.791
their choice for us. We're not their choice 
anymore. We have a number of them, but the

09:14.512 --> 09:21.160
curriculum has become more rigorous over the 
years. It's become more academic, less coaching

09:21.180 --> 09:30.730
related, and our student enrollment has, the 
quality has gone up consistently. In fact, if you

09:31.250 --> 09:36.638
look at our health education people, they will 
compete with anybody on this campus. Anybody on

09:36.658 --> 09:38.460
this campus. A lot of the folks in health education 
are in pre-physical therapy, for example. And I

09:45.631 --> 09:51.899
don't know how familiar you are with physical 
therapy, but that curriculum is very difficult to

09:45.631 --> 09:51.899
get into. They interview about 30 people for every 
one person they take. They tell me that it's even

09:56.286 --> 09:59.991
more difficult to get into physical therapy now 
than it is to get into medicine. medicine has

10:00.207 --> 10:03.533
gotten to where it's about a three-to-one 
relationship. Is that part of the College of

10:03.593 --> 10:06.017
Medicine? Our health education program serves a 
number of those people to get necessary

10:08.000 --> 10:13.810
prerequisites. And then there's five programs in 
the state. San Antonio has one, UT at San Antonio.

10:19.079 --> 10:21.102
Galveston has one. TWU in Houston has one, Texas 
Tech has one, and UT at Dallas has one. So it's five

10:29.577 --> 10:31.679
programs. And a lot of our folks are going through a 
pre-nursing curriculum as well. So we get a

10:35.303 --> 10:40.549
broad-based type of student in health education. 
Exercise Tech folks have been very, very high

10:40.569 --> 10:45.014
quality. In fact, we've had two students who've 
used that program as a pre-med curriculum. One of

10:49.786 --> 10:59.277
them got her degree in medicine this past time, and 
another one is in her second year in med school.

10:59.297 --> 11:02.040
Well, is there anything that you would like to 
close this with? Anything in particular? I don't

11:04.963 --> 11:08.607
know, again, what focus this, how I want to use all 
this dissertation. Like I said, I have not talked

11:09.268 --> 11:16.536
to anybody in your department, and maybe there's 
somebody that I need to talk to other than you've

11:09.268 --> 11:16.536
been here quite a while, and I know... Several 
people mentioned Dr. Landis, and if I can't, I know

11:16.887 --> 11:20.332
he's retired now, Ron. That's right, but he's in 
town a lot. But I might be able to visit with him. Dr.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.599
Landis would be a good person. There's two faculty 
members that would have been here longer than I.

11:29.244 --> 11:30.085
Three, in fact. Okay. One is Linus Dow, 
D-O-W-E-L-L, and Jack Chivret. Okay. I

11:38.825 --> 11:45.435
had gone through the videos to pick out ones that 
had been, and I had a couple of them. I just, the time

11:45.455 --> 11:54.690
element, I might try to do some by telephone from 
San Antonio and just have a tape recorder thing

11:45.455 --> 11:54.690
that catches on because I, physically, I'm 
having, now that I have a full-time job. Oh, yeah,

11:54.710 --> 11:57.274
you've got lots to do. But I really appreciate your 
time and the interview and your perceptions, and I

11:57.995 --> 12:04.545
hope that you'll let me come back if I have a 
question or if I call you.
