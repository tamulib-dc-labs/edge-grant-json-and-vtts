00:04.672 --> 00:10.199
I guess start briefly describe your background. 
With what I have in your letter, I guess you could

00:11.621 --> 00:14.084
just restate part of that again. From a police 
standpoint? Just your background. You can give me

00:18.350 --> 00:21.374
any education you've had.

00:25.099 --> 00:30.927
Born in 23, graduated from high school in 41. 
Started at TCU on a general...

00:36.481 --> 00:49.013
degree, dropped out, started to go to North Texas 
Agricultural College, University of Texas at

00:36.481 --> 00:49.013
Arlington, and dropped out of there.

00:53.737 --> 00:59.623
Went to the jewelry trade and wound up being a 
watchmaker for 17 years.

01:02.386 --> 01:04.868
In 59, joined the Fort Worth Waste Department. to

01:06.923 --> 01:32.357
basically two years walking the beat, two years in 
youth division, two years in detective office and

01:06.923 --> 01:32.357
the burglary division,

01:06.923 --> 01:32.357
made sergeant

01:34.818 --> 01:41.304
One year in communications for dispatch office, 
then went to patrol division. Oh, it was several

01:42.545 --> 01:47.590
years there, 10, 11, 12. I'm not sure right now 
which. Then went to records division, wound up as

01:50.352 --> 02:04.205
supervisor of the identification office for the 
remaining seven or eight years before

01:50.352 --> 02:04.205
retirement. OK. When you joined the police force 
in 59, what was your training like? What was

02:10.419 --> 02:12.161
stressed? The training, at that time, the

02:13.302 --> 02:33.985
training wound up, it was

02:13.302 --> 02:33.985
an eight-week school, 40 hours a week.

02:42.267 --> 02:56.823
They were trying to get across the law,

02:42.267 --> 02:56.823
which involved a number of classroom errors, 
naturally.

02:59.286 --> 03:03.691
The department procedures or policies.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.878
First aid was stressed heavily.

03:16.827 --> 03:20.612
I don't think of anything else right now. Driving 
wasn't stressed.

03:25.279 --> 03:28.804
It is now.

03:31.048 --> 03:38.318
Knowledge of the town, streets, buildings, 
names, this type of thing. But I believe that

03:40.301 --> 03:43.105
covers most of it. What's the training like today? 
How do they compare it? There's almost no

03:49.394 --> 03:52.217
comparison. Now they have a 16-week course. 
Before they're hired, they're given more

03:58.024 --> 04:10.138
testing, interviews, psychological 
evaluations, stress situations. than you can

04:11.536 --> 04:18.744
imagine, and most of them are useless.

04:20.425 --> 04:41.087
But the actual training division now, or training 
school, as the rookies go through, involves quite

04:20.425 --> 04:41.087
a bit of time at the firing range, getting familiar 
with pistols, and shotguns. Most of that brought

04:44.456 --> 05:00.334
on the Supreme Court decision requiring or 
holding departments liable in a vehicle police

04:44.456 --> 05:00.334
shooting where the man might not have been 
adequately trained in some court's opinion.

05:01.695 --> 05:09.724
They're given quite a bit of driver's training in 
emergency pursuit driving. this type of stuff

05:10.598 --> 05:39.542
basically for the same reason and because the 
frequency of accidents involve quite a bit of

05:10.598 --> 05:39.542
money in repair work and downtime for a vehicle 
should be in use first aid I don't believe they're

05:10.598 --> 05:39.542
giving any first aid at all now they boast us heavy 
with

05:10.598 --> 05:39.542
it laws They're stressed. Department policies 
are stressed. Your civil rights or actions that

05:46.819 --> 06:03.462
subject the city to lawsuit are stressed heavy.

06:03.622 --> 06:06.607
Physical training is stressed quite a bit. 
They've got a gym and they... have a physical P.E.

06:14.925 --> 06:21.214
class like in high school every day.

06:21.234 --> 06:28.064
But

06:21.234 --> 06:28.064
there's not a whole lot of comparison with what it 
was five years ago. Why do you think it changed? A

06:31.870 --> 06:41.524
lot of it is departments or the city's

06:31.870 --> 06:41.524
desire for trying to provide better educated more 
educated a more rounded educated officer a lot of

06:43.242 --> 07:11.595
it is because the laws have been interpreted in 
such a way that subjects the city to civil

06:43.242 --> 07:11.595
liability so much so I believe One of our attorneys 
a while back was telling me at that particular time

07:12.571 --> 07:39.226
we had 25 or 27 separate lawsuits pending in 
federal court on civil rights violations, which

07:12.571 --> 07:39.226
in the late 50s and early 60s were never

07:12.571 --> 07:39.226
heard of. And it's subject to quite a bit of 
financial stress. Other

07:44.127 --> 08:01.609
reasons would be protest groups hollering, 
minority groups stressing employment in their

07:44.127 --> 08:01.609
particular minority.

08:07.216 --> 08:09.038
There would be a variety of other reasons.

08:11.853 --> 08:16.678
More of a, I mean, as far as the city was concerned, 
like there's a protection of their own.

08:17.319 --> 08:18.340
Protection of their own.

08:22.505 --> 08:23.146
Okay. You said one of your first assignments was to 
the foot patrol in the downtown area. How do you

08:28.792 --> 08:31.675
think the public perceived the police then? That 
particular job at that time was described to me,

08:38.279 --> 08:41.383
and I believe they were pretty close to right. It 
was basically 75% public relations. The officers

08:46.370 --> 08:58.827
assigned to that detail would stand on a major 
downtown intersection directing traffic. The

08:58.847 --> 09:06.497
job was to direct traffic 30 minutes, then walk to 
B, which would be, oh, four, six, or eight block

09:07.253 --> 09:18.249
area, getting familiar with the business people, 
professional people, and getting to know the

09:07.253 --> 09:18.249
neighborhood and being seen.

09:24.318 --> 09:28.544
It was more of a high visibility job than anything 
else. There were some police actions that you took

09:29.685 --> 09:37.176
that just happened to come back.

09:37.645 --> 09:42.490
I believe it was all the probability was 75% public 
relations. We thought we did a good job. People

09:44.232 --> 09:50.218
that were around us enjoyed having us to talk to. 
But that particular job has been abolished now in

09:50.238 --> 10:03.512
favor of putting more policemen in patrol cars.

10:03.532 --> 10:05.914
How do you think that, well, It's kind of hard to 
follow up on that one, but how do you think police

10:06.198 --> 10:12.825
are viewed today, since there's really not that 
same job anymore? As a department? As an entity,

10:17.790 --> 10:26.398
how does the public see the police department?

10:26.418 --> 10:29.121
Now, let me break it down a little bit. How do I feel 
about it? How does the government feel about it?

10:32.705 --> 10:34.186
How does our department feel about it? How do you 
think? the public sees the police department

10:35.257 --> 10:39.282
today? The general public

10:39.302 --> 10:55.144
has

10:39.302 --> 10:55.144
a reasonable amount of respect to the Congress and 
the police department. I'm talking about four.

10:56.546 --> 10:59.049
That's all I want to know.

11:02.614 --> 11:04.116
They will support them to a reasonable degree. 
Other towns

11:08.357 --> 11:15.688
are more and other towns are less. I believe Fort 
Worth would be more or less in the average

11:15.708 --> 11:27.904
on that. Okay. To give you an example,

11:28.886 --> 11:35.014
a number of years ago, This is one back in 2015, 25 
years. There were studies made and so forth from

11:41.321 --> 11:49.874
police departments and its inadequacies and 
needs. And everybody that was involved in the

11:51.477 --> 12:00.310
study recommended that we have a new police 
building. At that time, the police department's

12:01.370 --> 12:08.181
main offices were in the basement of the city hall.

12:12.167 --> 12:18.777
The city council at that time thought that was a 
great idea and immediately put it to a bond vote to

12:12.167 --> 12:18.777
build a new city hall. They dropped all 
suggestions and the police building was

12:21.321 --> 12:27.210
completed and put it out to the city hall. The bond 
vote when the new city hall issue was rejected by

12:30.597 --> 12:34.923
the public. Several years later, another survey 
was made, and the prime recommendation of that

12:36.666 --> 12:52.709
study was that we have a new police building, a 
centralized police building. The council, which

12:52.729 --> 12:55.052
had changed thought that was a great idea, and 
immediately put it out to a bond vote for a new city

12:56.062 --> 13:00.849
hall. Dropped all suggestions to the police 
building, but they won the city hall, because then

13:02.492 --> 13:10.323
the police would use an old building if they wanted 
to go up. When they released a bond vote by the

13:12.787 --> 13:19.057
people, it was rejected. This makes twice that the 
same issue has come up and been rejected. The third

13:23.724 --> 13:24.685
time, would be

13:25.930 --> 13:31.296
maybe 10, 12 years ago. And the thing come up just 
exactly like it had before. The public finally

13:37.383 --> 13:44.251
voted for a new city hall after the recommendation 
had been made with the new police building. And the

13:44.271 --> 13:50.858
police wound up getting two-thirds of the old city 
hall.

13:57.841 --> 14:14.661
Is

13:57.841 --> 14:14.661
this public confidence or public respect or your 
city officials who are actual employers of the

13:57.841 --> 14:14.661
police department? This has finally changed 
within the last year.

14:25.212 --> 14:49.139
Boat was finally brought up again and they did 
build a new police building in connection with the

14:25.212 --> 14:49.139
county jail and within the last year have moved 
into a new police building.

14:49.159 --> 14:50.140
Twenty years later.

14:52.938 --> 14:59.989
If at any time you do this you feel like throwing in 
something from a previous question you thought of

14:52.938 --> 14:59.989
or just anything, feel free. You said the Fort 
Worth police chief usually has risen up from

15:02.412 --> 15:07.320
within the department's own ranks.

15:11.366 --> 15:13.810
And then in 1777 they brought Brown over from 
Dallas. What effect did it have when you bring in an

15:15.672 --> 15:20.700
outsider to be the police chief? on the operation 
of the force and the attitudes of the officers? The

15:25.806 --> 15:29.914
effect, as far as A.J. Brown was concerned, Brown 
was a career man that was a Dallas police officer.

15:36.906 --> 15:40.252
He got his 20 years in and Dallas has a 20-year 
retirement plan. Then he could retire and get a job

15:41.314 --> 15:45.000
somewhere else. Then when he reached retirement 
age, he started on a Dallas retirement, which

15:46.820 --> 15:53.951
meant that he had to have a job. He wound up as a 
police chief in Norfolk, Virginia. Then Fort

16:00.461 --> 16:04.888
Worth hired him from Norfolk to come to Fort Worth. 
But he's basically a Dallas trained, Dallas

16:04.908 --> 16:11.399
oriented police officer. He was Nearly all of his 
career was assigned to inside jobs and worked very

16:14.900 --> 16:29.844
few investigative or police enforcement jobs on 
the street. And when the Fort Worth got him, a

16:29.864 --> 16:41.683
number of

16:29.864 --> 16:41.683
the officers were, I believe, more or less 
naturally resentful The city council didn't seem

16:43.604 --> 16:53.079
to feel that our department had a man capable of 
being chief.

16:56.124 --> 17:00.271
I believe we did and still do. The council more or 
less explained it in

17:00.291 --> 17:10.287
an unpublicized way there had been certain 
cliques developed within the police department

17:11.262 --> 17:29.366
that they wanted to bring in on the outside, break 
up those cliques, and then within three to five

17:11.262 --> 17:29.366
years, have a chief on the inside back.

17:30.447 --> 17:34.713
This held true in that Brown was here three years. 
He brought in several radical ideas, radical to

17:41.030 --> 17:46.398
full worth idiot.

17:48.521 --> 18:02.823
He finally left

17:48.521 --> 18:02.823
more or less at a time of considerable dissension 
within the city. And the city officials

18:17.243 --> 18:27.135
promoted a man to chief that had been in the running 
for several years, in contention for several

18:17.243 --> 18:27.135
years.

18:31.100 --> 18:44.837
He was chief for five or six years and has just now 
officially retired and went back outside and

18:31.100 --> 18:44.837
hired a man from Los Angeles to be their next chief.

18:49.947 --> 19:00.397
In

18:49.947 --> 19:00.397
the late 60s and early 70s, it seemed like civil 
rights finally reached Fort Worth as an issue. It

19:02.018 --> 19:09.746
began to make news and be more dominant. What's the 
police response to when you have such a major shift

19:09.766 --> 19:17.473
in relations between races? Now, are you talking 
about your protest minority groups? Just the

19:23.416 --> 19:41.096
civil rights, not so much the protesting, but the 
shifting relations between, you know, your

19:23.416 --> 19:41.096
traditional relations between blacks and whites 
or any minority were changing, and how did that

19:23.416 --> 19:41.096
affect the police, or how did the police respond, 
or was it a factor at all?

19:44.920 --> 19:47.443
I'm not sure I just understand just exactly what 
you're asking me. The way blacks and whites and

19:49.685 --> 19:55.673
anybody got along for decades and decades was 
changing. How did that affect? How did the police

19:59.518 --> 20:02.202
respond to this? Did it change anything? Yes, it 
changed a whole lot. All of your... Well, it

20:07.369 --> 20:13.757
started out as blacks.

20:16.942 --> 20:17.903
Then it evolved.

20:21.562 --> 20:28.128
Hispanics, and next come the flower children.

20:31.872 --> 20:43.463
And since then, there's been half a dozen splinter 
groups of minorities making complaints or

20:31.872 --> 20:43.463
protests or demonstrations of some form. But it 
did make a big change in the police department. And

20:52.358 --> 21:11.763
that not just the police department, the city, the 
city officials, the courts, the training

20:52.358 --> 21:11.763
division for the recruits,

20:52.358 --> 21:11.763
the employees they hired. It made quite a bit

21:13.366 --> 21:18.152
of difference to us. How would you describe the 
difference? Okay, it changed things, but how

21:21.063 --> 21:24.207
would you describe that change? Well, one of the 
first

21:26.451 --> 21:45.378
examples to bring up,

21:26.451 --> 21:45.378
used to we had niggers and negroes. The first

21:45.398 --> 21:50.665
minority groups or blacks or whatever they want to 
be called, decided they wanted to be called

21:52.433 --> 22:08.333
Negroes, as to

21:52.433 --> 22:08.333
correspond or rhyme with your neat, Negroes. 
Don't call them niggers, call them Negroes. The

22:12.879 --> 22:19.808
next group come along said, we don't want to be 
called Negroes, we're Negroes as a race, we are a

22:12.879 --> 22:19.808
color, we are colored people.

22:22.994 --> 22:29.420
It wasn't a year later until they decided, well, we 
are colored, but we're black. Now we want to be

22:30.501 --> 22:34.325
called black people. We had a

22:34.345 --> 22:49.379
session there, or not a session, but a series of

22:34.345 --> 22:49.379
sensitivity sessions. That's a joke if there ever 
was. But in bringing those up, we had a supposed to

22:52.103 --> 23:02.419
have been a highly respected professor from the 
college. And in the classroom discussion, we

23:04.402 --> 23:09.049
asked him, what would you call them? They don't 
even want to, they don't know what they want to be

23:09.069 --> 23:13.676
called in himself. He said, well, if I was talking 
to somebody one-on-one, In the first sentence, I

23:17.197 --> 23:27.326
would address him as a colored person, as a Negro 
person, and as a black person, and see which one he

23:17.197 --> 23:27.326
responded to best, and then that's the way I would 
address him from then on. I got a lot of hit people.

23:32.030 --> 23:46.883
The sensitivity sessions were to take, you had a 
militant blacks and a group of policemen, that was

23:47.825 --> 24:03.440
supposed to be representative of the police 
department, and sit them in one room, the

23:47.825 --> 24:03.440
policemen were to be quiet, sit still, and not let 
themselves get upset, and the blacks were to call

23:47.825 --> 24:03.440
them every name under the sun that they could think 
of for eight hours. And yet, if they made one word of

24:06.143 --> 24:14.431
complaint, they received a disciplinary letter 
in their personnel file.

24:14.451 --> 24:16.853
That was to go on for a week at a time. Naturally, 
there was some hard beatings over those.

24:23.822 --> 24:25.524
That's what happened. That's hard to believe, 
that part. It's fact.

24:35.655 --> 24:36.696
How long did that continue? I mean, the 
sensitivity? Different groups under different

24:38.559 --> 24:46.808
names with different lengths of time in 
attendance. Approximately two years.

24:50.785 --> 24:55.652
Assuming there was no... Oh, this was the thing to 
do. Everybody was doing this. This was to educate

24:57.154 --> 25:08.069
the policeman as to how the blacks felt when he was 
called a black or a colored person or a negro or a

24:57.154 --> 25:08.069
nigger or a motherfucker. That's... So we'd know 
how they felt.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.185
This may seem a silly question, but you... There 
was no gain as far as the police were concerned from

25:20.553 --> 25:24.660
this? It seemed like it just generated hard 
feelings. I believe hard feelings only did

25:26.984 --> 25:28.787
generate. We had a number of the policemen come 
back that had been sent to one of those schools and

25:29.929 --> 25:36.079
say, I'm not going back or I'm going to quit. You can 
do what you want to with the chief, but I ain't going

25:37.622 --> 25:41.027
back to another one of those places.

25:44.633 --> 25:46.797
There was never anybody fired for not going.

25:52.413 --> 26:00.782
When

25:52.413 --> 26:00.782
civil rights first became an issue in Fort Worth, 
were there any blacks in the force at that time?

26:01.022 --> 26:02.784
Yeah. What were their opinions? Did they ever make 
a public stance? No. NAACP wouldn't allow that.

26:13.056 --> 26:14.457
What did they do? How did they respond? At that 
time, we didn't have anywhere near the proportion

26:15.639 --> 26:21.525
of blacks. on the department there must have been 
say 12 or 15 this is when we had a department of 300

26:21.944 --> 26:51.428
personnel uh

26:21.944 --> 26:51.428
mostly they were assigned to black communities 
because that's where they knew the people and the

26:21.944 --> 26:51.428
people knew them everyone that ever got fired or 
had personnel problems

26:52.792 --> 27:21.263
the issue was over females every black policeman 
we had that was killed was killed by his wife

26:52.792 --> 27:21.263
up until oh probably 65 68 somewhere along that 
because he wasn't in the business

27:25.681 --> 27:38.139
Since then, we've had more police, more blacks, 
more females, more Hispanics, now Asiatics, and

27:25.681 --> 27:38.139
so forth hired. And other issues have come into it, 
but

27:38.199 --> 27:45.148
that's kind of the background of what it was.

27:48.012 --> 27:51.958
As the number of blacks on the force increased, the 
proportion increased, How did that change the

27:53.288 --> 27:57.034
relationship between blacks and whites on the 
floors? It seemed like it was a... Some good, some

28:01.340 --> 28:04.165
bad. We've been forced through threats,

28:05.787 --> 28:18.807
threats of a quota system, threats from the city 
manager, threats from the council

28:20.322 --> 28:30.498
regarding personnel or pay raises. One thing or 
another,

28:30.638 --> 28:43.758
more

28:30.638 --> 28:43.758
emphasis being placed on recruitment of 
minorities.

28:46.342 --> 28:48.085
Federal grants get involved.

28:50.613 --> 28:55.841
When money's involved, things get serious.

28:59.386 --> 29:01.790
Some of the minorities that we hire are good. A lot 
of them are hired for, to fill a quota, or if there is

29:03.593 --> 29:18.055
no quota, to make it look close to

29:03.593 --> 29:18.055
one.

29:21.140 --> 29:35.339
A lot of the blacks that we have hired aren't worth a 
damn and they're being carried on the table just

29:21.140 --> 29:35.339
because they're black.

29:36.501 --> 29:42.650
You can't fire them as easily as you can a wife. 
Females that we've

29:45.213 --> 29:50.320
hired

29:53.067 --> 29:58.536
Less than 50% of them are effective police 
officers. The other 50% are hired to, not hired,

29:58.556 --> 30:07.650
but they are placed in jobs that any clerk can 
handle. But they're a police officer and going to a

30:09.293 --> 30:13.659
police officer's salary. And they're incapable 
of being a police officer.

30:18.527 --> 30:19.108
And I believe that That percentage would even be 
higher among the black females. Hispanics, I

30:26.806 --> 30:37.297
don't know about them, but I

30:26.806 --> 30:37.297
don't know many of them. Let's see. One time 
before, not recently, but a while back, we were

30:39.779 --> 30:49.669
talking, and you mentioned that the NAACP 
wouldn't pursue any litigation that involved a

30:39.779 --> 30:49.669
black officer. They limit themselves to only 
action about the white police.

30:59.228 --> 31:03.175
What's a policeman to think when something like 
that happens? Only limit our action to just this.
