WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:10.860
Did family, background, ancestry, race, 
national origin have anything to do with? Outside

00:10.880 --> 00:12.282
of work ethic, no. No, because we had every type. We 
had Bohunks, Polacks, no names. We had wealthy. We

00:21.075 --> 00:21.676
had poor. It didn't make any difference what your 
dad did. It didn't make any difference where they

00:25.983 --> 00:32.232
had gone to school, where they lived. A&M, you 
know, friends at Texas, friends at SMU, TCU, Rice,

00:32.836 --> 00:44.595
Baylor, family status was always important to 
somebody somewhere along the way, but not at A&M.

00:45.456 --> 00:51.025
A&M was, everybody's the same because we're all in 
this thing together. And if you choose to run

00:51.225 --> 00:55.692
against the wind, pack your bags. If you're a 
tattletale or if you're a whiner, you weren't

01:00.055 --> 01:25.776
welcome in the outfit they welcomed everybody 
until they turned until somebody turns on the

01:00.055 --> 01:25.776
outfit you don't squeal on your fish buddies you 
stand together and I don't know I think that's you

01:00.055 --> 01:25.776
want to talk about Aggie spirit it is about that 
bonding together under and you get the same thing

01:00.055 --> 01:25.776
in troops in combat and things like that but 
they're they're shipped out and gone this was One

01:26.870 --> 01:32.217
year of being a freshman, but also four years of 
living together in the Corps of Cadets. And I hate

01:32.237 --> 01:44.133
to say it, there's no way that these kids that live 
in apartments that ride, take their automobile

01:32.237 --> 01:44.133
in, get that class and leave, they're not part of 
the A&M experience, unfortunately. Right. Now, I

01:45.375 --> 01:47.798
don't need to ask you the next question. What did 
you learn at A&M that's been important in your

01:47.818 --> 01:50.582
life? You just said that. If you were a consultant 
to the A&M leadership today, What advice would you

01:58.358 --> 02:05.709
give them about making A&M's future as bright as 
possible? I would continue to do everything I

02:06.971 --> 02:25.800
could to encourage continuation and membership 
in the Corps of Cadets and to do everything I could

02:06.971 --> 02:25.800
from ever making any organization an elitist 
organization that could have money tied to it of

02:06.971 --> 02:25.800
any kind.

02:28.278 --> 02:32.288
I don't even know about Caldwell House, except 
it's very expensive to live there. But A&M has

02:32.368 --> 02:36.838
always been a place for a poor kid from the country 
to go to school. Now, I'm fine to make money, but

02:37.019 --> 02:46.000
it's OK to go to college without wearing polo 
shirts and dressing to the nines and driving a BMW.

02:47.684 --> 02:50.368
I would continue Bonfire as it was. Safety 
measures can be implemented. Supervision is

02:54.414 --> 03:04.790
there and you can get outside people, A&M or not 
A&M, you can get outside expertise to help from

02:54.414 --> 03:04.790
safety, engineering safety, structure. It can be 
done. It's too valuable a tradition to lose.

03:11.765 --> 03:14.149
These are the things that I would like to see 
continue. Remember the strengths that this

03:15.913 --> 03:23.246
school was born on and why it was a school for the 
common man. It doesn't mean lower your standards,

03:23.527 --> 03:28.696
keep your standards high, but require something 
more. Next to the last question. If you could make a

03:32.774 --> 03:45.656
major gift to Texas A&M, let's make believe that 
somebody hands you a check for a million dollars

03:32.774 --> 03:45.656
and there's one restriction on it, it must be 
passed on to A&M, but you can decide what would be

03:32.774 --> 03:45.656
done with it. What would you have A&M do with a major 
gift if you could make one? I would give it to the

03:50.124 --> 03:58.258
Corps of Cadets and I would not put it into programs 
so much as I would put it into

04:01.664 --> 04:16.904
probably a mixture of continued leadership 
training, perhaps better housing, perhaps Corps

04:01.664 --> 04:16.904
scholarships to recruit the best and the 
brightest to make it worthwhile for people on the

04:01.664 --> 04:16.904
outside to see, hey, this could be a good deal. And 
then encourage anything we could to make the

04:17.786 --> 04:27.098
Corps, which is so central to the experience at 
A&M, I would give every penny of it to the Corps of

04:17.786 --> 04:27.098
Cadets. One of the things that the Corps is not 
doing these days, Corps leadership, as far as I'm

04:27.078 --> 04:36.369
aware, they are not going out to recruit bright 
juniors. They're waiting until March and April of

04:36.990 --> 04:40.474
their senior year. Way too late. Well, he decided 
long ago where he was going to go to college. And the

04:45.580 --> 04:48.343
brighter they are, the earlier the hustle. i i 
really think that they need to do they need to

04:48.560 --> 05:14.820
target juniors yes and on spend the night with the 
corps they need to be very careful and i would

04:48.560 --> 05:14.820
encourage the leadership that whatever outside 
of your cadets whatever military personnel you

04:48.560 --> 05:14.820
have i would make dead level sure that they are 
hand-picked for the job to deal with these high

04:48.560 --> 05:14.820
school students who are in the primordia when 
they're in those formative years of thinking

05:15.543 --> 05:18.606
about where they're going to go to school, that 
sophomore, that junior. Let's get that military

05:19.206 --> 05:25.592
officer that can be conversant and answer the 
questions that the parents have and the kid has.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.755
And those are hard to find in today's military. And 
if not military, maybe some advisors, some people

05:30.336 --> 05:33.678
that have been there. But yeah, those would be my 
concerns. Last question. Last question. What

05:41.125 --> 05:44.908
feelings do you hold for Texas A&M in your heart 
today?

05:49.259 --> 05:49.980
Warm and fuzzy.

05:54.390 --> 06:01.043
It's an emotional experience that comes and goes 
when you hear the war hymn. I left the drill field in

06:03.448 --> 06:05.152
1972. I'm not one of these Aggies that I don't have 
to beat every football game. We go about once, I

06:09.305 --> 06:11.329
will go to a few more now. Boys are starting to 
school, but it's more than who's paid

06:11.931 --> 06:20.107
professional athletes can move the pigskin up and 
down the football field. I'm sick of it, but it's

06:20.207 --> 06:29.526
still, you know, we still like, you know, A&M 
football games are neat, I guess, but very...

06:29.742 --> 06:40.020
Deep, probably the single most important driving 
force next to my salvation as a Christian has been

06:29.742 --> 06:40.020
my four years in the Corps of Cadets at A&M. Did more 
to, for better or for worse, for me as an

06:40.601 --> 06:44.788
individual. They made my service life easy. That 
made practice life easy.

06:52.388 --> 07:02.478
Whatever else I have done in community or 
veterinary medicine, whatever awards and things

06:52.388 --> 07:02.478
I've gotten are all colored by my four years at A&M. 
Not Robert E. Lee High School, not Trinity Day

07:03.199 --> 07:15.391
School, but those four years at Texas A&M in the 
Corps of Cadets did more to mold me for better or for

07:03.199 --> 07:15.391
worse than the person I am. So, yeah, some deep 
emotion, very deep emotion. That's a good place to

07:19.235 --> 07:20.016
go.
