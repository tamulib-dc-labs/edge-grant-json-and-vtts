00:04.891 --> 00:05.874
Okay.

00:05.894 --> 00:12.879
They used to pull what they all called Snuggies on bus two, and that got out of hand.

00:13.039 --> 00:14.003
I had to stop that.

00:15.167 --> 00:17.314
I remember, I forget what town we were in.

00:19.201 --> 00:22.204
But we were going from one town to another.

00:22.264 --> 00:25.067
It was one of these bus rocking incidences.

00:26.007 --> 00:27.969
And I stopped the first bus.

00:30.311 --> 00:32.674
Anyway, I went back to the second bus.

00:33.675 --> 00:34.796
And I got on the bus.

00:35.456 --> 00:42.963
And there they all were in the very, crammed in the very back of the bus with not a stitch of clothing on.

00:44.285 --> 00:45.866
And I mean, I couldn't help it.

00:45.906 --> 00:46.947
I just started laughing.

00:47.602 --> 00:50.185
Because I was ready to really chew on somebody.

00:51.146 --> 00:55.210
And I just laughed and turned around and walked back and got on the bus and we went on.

00:55.771 --> 00:57.973
But they never let me forget that.

00:58.414 --> 00:59.194
Never, never, never.

00:59.835 --> 01:00.296
It was fun.

01:00.336 --> 01:11.027
Do you remember in the early years ever singing any song which Aggie audience thought for some reason was not maroon enough?

01:11.446 --> 01:16.454
No, but one time in, it was Temple.

01:19.519 --> 01:23.085
We were singing, where have all the flowers gone?

01:24.407 --> 01:28.493
And of course, that's an anti-war song.

01:28.514 --> 01:32.520
Well, man, in the middle of the performance, and this had never happened.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.665
This was in like the late 60s, maybe.

01:37.315 --> 01:42.760
But this man got up and stormed out of the office, out of the audience.

01:44.321 --> 01:50.127
And the next day, when we got back from tour, I had a letter in my office.

01:50.147 --> 01:53.149
And he chewed me out one side and down the other.

01:54.230 --> 01:54.791
Really.

01:55.591 --> 01:57.333
And I found out he was a colonel.

01:57.393 --> 01:58.534
He was a retired colonel.

01:59.635 --> 02:07.322
And he thought that we were anti-war, anti-patriotism, and blah, blah, blah.

02:07.572 --> 02:08.193
God after it.

02:09.014 --> 02:18.806
And of course, our whole image in my feeling was to worship God, worship the country, and worship your fellow man.

02:19.327 --> 02:22.371
And we couldn't do that.

02:22.451 --> 02:27.437
If we couldn't display that, if we couldn't show that, then we were not doing something right.

02:28.345 --> 02:41.329
Did anyone either early years or later years ever complain about seeing cadets as a group from a public university singing religious music?

02:41.470 --> 02:42.812
No, no.

02:44.295 --> 02:48.042
That was always in the back of my mind, you know, somebody's going to do that.

02:48.325 --> 02:55.794
Well, I mean, it got to the point in some years where it was almost illegitimate to sing Christmas carols.

02:58.397 --> 03:01.180
But no, that never happened.

03:01.200 --> 03:01.901
Never happened.

03:03.202 --> 03:09.410
In fact, I mean, we got probably hundreds of letters praising the fact that we did.

03:09.750 --> 03:10.731
We didn't overdo it.

03:10.911 --> 03:11.532
We didn't.

03:11.512 --> 03:13.755
We didn't jam it down anybody's throat.

03:14.135 --> 03:20.503
And usually the sacred songs that we sang, the religious songs that we sang, were kind of upbeat.

03:20.824 --> 03:27.853
You know, they were spirituals maybe with a beat or a kind of jazzed up version of Amazing Grace.

03:28.814 --> 03:34.902
It wasn't just pure European heavy music.

03:36.524 --> 03:38.987
And we deliberately looked for things like that.

03:39.575 --> 03:45.962
Was there, when you arrived, was there a kind of a singing cadet repertoire of songs that was kind of standard?

03:45.982 --> 03:47.523
Yeah, of course, that's one thing.

03:47.724 --> 03:55.352
The whole time I was here, consolidated, and we'd have the cadets over at the high school in the auditorium for assemblies every year.

03:56.733 --> 03:59.636
But they came and they always sang the same songs.

03:59.696 --> 04:05.262
Bill never, Bill was actually more interested, and I'm not being derogatory here,

04:05.630 --> 04:12.817
But Bill was more interested in the Aggieland Dance Band than he was because he was a trumpet player than he was the singing cadets.

04:13.457 --> 04:16.440
And they'd sing the same songs every year, every year.

04:16.460 --> 04:19.183
And I'd say, you know, what a shame.

04:20.384 --> 04:21.905
What a waste of talent, you know.

04:23.126 --> 04:27.170
But one of the traditional, well, school songs were always traditional.

04:27.791 --> 04:35.518
But one of the songs they sang before I came was Nothing Like a Dane, which we still do.

04:35.954 --> 04:47.811
But the arrangement we do now is one that was done especially for us at one of the Miss Teenage America performances in Fort Worth.

04:47.971 --> 04:50.415
The arranger did it so we could do it with orchestra.

04:51.796 --> 04:55.742
And that's the one we still use today.

04:57.244 --> 04:57.665
Let's see.

04:59.447 --> 05:01.110
Let's go back to this man, Wayne Stark.

05:01.270 --> 05:02.231
Yep.

05:02.992 --> 05:05.556
What was it like working with him?

05:07.375 --> 05:10.339
It was great.

05:11.701 --> 05:14.044
He was a very moody man in some ways.

05:14.204 --> 05:16.047
I mean, he was up and down.

05:16.087 --> 05:20.893
He had terrific battles trying to get any money for anything.

05:21.174 --> 05:27.342
I mean, he was terrible, as we all did in student activities in those days.

05:28.334 --> 05:34.986
And it was like, well, do the best you can.

05:35.006 --> 05:39.694
We just don't have any funds to help you, blah, blah, blah.

05:40.496 --> 05:42.359
But we'll get some, blah, blah, blah.

05:42.940 --> 05:45.725
And five years later, we still hadn't gotten any.

05:46.867 --> 05:49.773
He was a hard, hard worker, Wayne was.

05:49.953 --> 05:51.135
He was always...

05:51.723 --> 05:54.432
I don't mean this derogatorily, but he was always conniving.

05:54.773 --> 06:03.724
He was always trying to find ways to overcome this lack of money and create new programs, new ideas.

06:04.092 --> 06:06.696
He loved the student body.

06:07.577 --> 06:08.899
And he loved A&M, of course.

06:10.041 --> 06:12.024
And he believed in them.

06:12.424 --> 06:13.806
He believed in the students.

06:14.868 --> 06:20.156
And we'd have those leadership conferences, which I was advisor to a couple of years.

06:20.897 --> 06:30.471
And he knew that those kids could be, not just because of their core training,

06:31.210 --> 06:35.921
But they could be super leaders if we'd let them, you know.

06:36.423 --> 06:38.788
And sometimes we had to make them do that.

06:39.470 --> 06:42.217
But he was a special man, very special.

06:42.457 --> 06:48.612
Now, those of us over on the faculty side thought that he was a kind of a self-appointed apostle

06:48.862 --> 07:15.645
for the for arts and music on the campus he was he was and he felt that he felt that responsibility and it was a responsibility to him it wasn't just a fly-by-night kind of thing I mean he felt that A&M must have that and and he was going to do whatever it took to get it you know he was that way now y'all were part of what today would be called student affairs

07:16.233 --> 07:16.734
Right.

07:16.754 --> 07:18.596
And reported to Dean Hannigan.

07:18.616 --> 07:18.876
Right.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.057
Right.

07:20.077 --> 07:24.182
Describe his relation to the seeing cadets.

07:24.222 --> 07:25.864
Well, oh, seeing cadets.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.288
He liked us.

07:30.590 --> 07:39.860
Again, it was a financial thing.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.084
I mean, we we had to have money to travel.

07:43.840 --> 07:51.589
He had to have money to replace uniforms as they were worn out or torn or whatever.

07:51.649 --> 07:54.232
And they were expensive.

07:55.814 --> 08:00.600
And he tried, but he couldn't make any progress either, really.

08:00.620 --> 08:10.212
I mean, his budget, I would guess, was something less than probably a third of what it is now.

08:11.253 --> 08:13.155
It was really unreal.

08:13.793 --> 08:23.362
But everybody we felt expected us to go on doing what we're doing and do it better and do it bigger and blah, blah, blah.

08:23.402 --> 08:34.892
As advisor to Town Hall, I mean, there were years where we almost went out of business because we didn't have enough income.

08:35.553 --> 08:42.079
And those shows in those days, I mean, Fred Waring, The Four Freshmen, The Brothers Four,

08:42.211 --> 08:45.296
You know, they were expensive groups then.

08:46.818 --> 08:55.731
Anyway, no, Jim Hennigan was a super guy and very helpful in many ways.

08:56.172 --> 08:57.915
Defended us many times.

08:58.496 --> 09:07.649
Did any administrator ever attempt to second guess your program in terms of what you sang and did not sing?

09:09.112 --> 09:09.332
No.

09:09.835 --> 09:14.563
I never had anyone tell me what to sing or what not to sing, ever.

09:15.946 --> 09:28.367
One incident though, in our early years when we were still performing in Guyon Hall, during intermission,

09:28.735 --> 09:34.060
We had student wives and faculty wives at that time.

09:34.560 --> 09:39.705
And we had formed a group called Six Little Girls in Blue, a sextet, a girl sextet.

09:39.745 --> 09:40.385
And they were good.

09:40.665 --> 09:41.126
They were good.

09:41.926 --> 09:49.133
So one year at our Syncadet Spring concert, during an admission, I had them sing three songs.

09:50.574 --> 09:57.460
Well, the next morning, Monday, President Ryder was on my phone saying,

09:58.081 --> 10:06.336
I don't know how you're going to do it, but you get out of that as quick as possible and don't ever do it again, meaning featuring girls.

10:06.536 --> 10:09.661
And this was before he changed his mind.

10:09.681 --> 10:17.355
I mean, boy, I almost lost my job because of the, and Carolyn Adair was one of those people, one of those girls.

10:17.892 --> 10:23.520
And you don't know whether this was his idea or someone said it to him.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.081
I don't know.

10:24.341 --> 10:24.842
I never knew.

10:24.902 --> 10:27.606
But I knew it scared the dickens out of me.

10:27.706 --> 10:32.353
It must have been like 61 or 62.

10:32.513 --> 10:34.736
I was still new.

10:34.756 --> 10:39.002
And I didn't dream that anyone would feel that way.

10:39.062 --> 10:44.249
I thought, gee, isn't this nice to have these six girls faculty-wise sing and blah, blah, blah.

10:44.650 --> 10:44.710
Oh.

10:45.230 --> 10:48.334
In those early years... That's the only time that happened, though.

10:49.114 --> 10:52.558
On campus, where did you most often perform physically?

10:52.598 --> 10:53.519
What was the location?

10:55.422 --> 10:56.463
In the 60s?

10:56.683 --> 10:59.126
Well, we did All Faiths Chapel.

11:00.207 --> 11:01.789
We did it in the YMCA.

11:03.391 --> 11:04.792
We did an MSC, of course.

11:04.832 --> 11:05.113
Yeah.

11:05.613 --> 11:06.014
Guyon?

11:06.794 --> 11:07.075
Yes.

11:07.415 --> 11:08.837
That's where we had a spring concert.

11:10.539 --> 11:10.699
Okay.

11:11.119 --> 11:12.621
Until they tore it down.

11:13.883 --> 11:27.219
And then we moved our rehearsal area, as I said we were in the old music hall at the end of G Raleigh.

11:27.359 --> 11:33.166
And they condemned it three times, four times.

11:34.828 --> 11:43.519
Because we'd have rehearsals upstairs with the grand piano up there and the risers and the guys and we'd get a song going that was really kind of bouncy and we'd all start

11:43.887 --> 11:48.475
bouncing with the music, and the floor would move six inches up and down.

11:49.276 --> 11:55.026
Anyway, we finally got out of there and moved from there into G. Raleigh White.

11:55.787 --> 12:09.490
They built a special rehearsal room for us in what is now, I think, one of the physical labs there on the first floor facing the Coldest building.

12:10.651 --> 12:14.116
And that's where I taught my classes as well, my music appreciation classes.

12:17.922 --> 12:22.068
Now, those music appreciation classes, in what department were they classified?

12:22.088 --> 12:23.310
Philosophy and Humanities.

12:26.875 --> 12:30.640
I never really understood that, but I was glad to do it, because I enjoyed that.

12:31.542 --> 12:39.173
It was actually a class in learning how to appreciate

12:40.115 --> 12:51.929
all kinds of music, but mainly change the country cowboy image into something that they could learn to like beyond that.

12:53.530 --> 13:00.358
And of course we listened to a lot of, had a good sound system, and we listened to a lot of music.

13:00.739 --> 13:06.325
And that's one of the reasons I started the music program in the browsing library at the Memorial Student Center.

13:06.710 --> 13:10.395
So they could have a place to go listen to what we had listened to in class.

13:12.578 --> 13:13.059
Let's see.

13:14.121 --> 13:16.905
Do you have any more Rudder stories?

13:19.168 --> 13:20.410
No.

13:20.430 --> 13:27.740
I remember, of course, this office then was in the assistance administration building, facing Highway 6.

13:28.701 --> 13:35.451
And I remember going there several times when we were trying to get money for a trip.

13:35.954 --> 13:38.978
And he was always very cordial, always very nice.

13:39.579 --> 13:51.956
Of course, as I say, I was directing the music at A&M Methodist Church, and every Sunday morning there sat the general and the general's wife and the kids in the second pew on the right-hand side.

13:52.036 --> 13:53.498
That was their pew.

13:54.599 --> 14:02.670
And I knew the kids and I knew Mrs. Rudder through teaching them, teaching the kids, Bobby, A&M.

14:05.165 --> 14:05.786
Excuse me.

14:06.126 --> 14:18.280
I had Anne in class in history survey course the summer after she graduated and consolidated high school before she went west to Utah.

14:18.460 --> 14:19.061
She was a doll.

14:19.081 --> 14:19.562
She still is.

14:19.702 --> 14:22.105
Yes, she's splendid.

14:23.266 --> 14:26.430
Let's see, did the cadets sing at Mr. Rudder's memorial service?

14:26.590 --> 14:27.891
Yes.

14:28.172 --> 14:32.877
And we sang at all the inaugural of the new presidents.

14:33.025 --> 14:37.703
Were there any special memories you have of that memorial service?

14:38.662 --> 14:41.025
No, I just know that it was very solemn.

14:42.587 --> 14:45.371
Everyone was in a kind of shock.

14:46.212 --> 14:50.858
It was almost, at that time, it was almost as bad as the bonfire disaster.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.960
I mean, everyone felt that way.

14:53.561 --> 14:58.447
I remember seeing LBJ and Lady Bird and Governor Shivers.

14:59.168 --> 15:02.412
Almost every important Texan that I knew was there.

15:02.773 --> 15:04.735
For the first time, I'd never seen any of them.

15:04.755 --> 15:06.137
Right, right.

15:06.117 --> 15:10.623
Did, all right, within a year, Jack Williams got here.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.364
Right.

15:11.384 --> 15:12.686
Did you have any?

15:12.726 --> 15:15.350
He was very positive for the St.

15:15.370 --> 15:15.710
Cadets.

15:17.793 --> 15:20.457
We'd drop in on rehearsals from time to time.

15:24.042 --> 15:25.304
Nice gentleman.

15:26.746 --> 15:29.209
Good sense of humor.

15:32.213 --> 15:32.614
Liked him.

15:32.881 --> 15:55.935
liked us i mean we we felt comfortable and and we always felt and again we're still fighting budgets we're all the time but we always felt with him uh we something would happen you know that we'd get something done and he did he helped us make one of our trips um but we did his inaugural as well

15:56.911 --> 16:00.116
We did all the president's inaugurations, one way or another.

16:00.456 --> 16:09.209
As you remember your budget in the 60s and 70s, it was paid your salary, and what else?

16:09.689 --> 16:11.151
And the accompanist's salary.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.053
And the accompanist.

16:12.073 --> 16:12.553
June Bearing.

16:12.834 --> 16:14.736
Was that a full-time or part-time?

16:14.757 --> 16:17.761
It was part-time, June's was.

16:17.941 --> 16:22.167
Eventually it became full-time, just so she could get benefits.

16:22.307 --> 16:23.509
What else did it provide?

16:24.535 --> 16:25.296
The budget?

16:25.977 --> 16:41.324
Oh, uniform repair and maintenance, purchase of music, which in the early days, I could buy a choral octavo, a one sheet of music for 12 cents, 15 cents.

16:41.344 --> 16:45.791
Now it's $2.75 a copy.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.394
You know, it's ridiculous.

16:48.817 --> 16:49.598
It's unreal.

16:50.320 --> 16:53.945
I'd say it paid also travel budget?

16:54.205 --> 16:58.490
Yeah, but remember in the early days, we didn't really travel that much.

16:59.251 --> 17:03.236
And when we did, we usually traveled on just one bus in those days.

17:03.737 --> 17:11.587
But when we got to a membership of about 60, 70, it would vary, we had to have two buses.

17:12.167 --> 17:15.872
And we used to do our tours, our long tours, during spring break.

17:16.645 --> 17:28.242
But it got to the point where so many profs were scheduling exams or papers due at the end of spring break that we had to stop that.

17:28.562 --> 17:30.765
I mean, it was just too much on the guys.

17:31.366 --> 17:34.871
So we switched to going in between semesters.

17:34.891 --> 17:40.319
And so the guys would come back two weeks early from Christmas vacation.

17:41.261 --> 17:45.066
We'd rehearse for a week and then travel for 10 days.

17:46.058 --> 17:49.702
And then come back, get back on Sunday, and they start class on Monday.

17:52.646 --> 18:04.960
When things began in the fall, for a new prospective member of Seen Cadets, there were auditions.

18:06.402 --> 18:09.605
How quickly did they know whether they were accepted or not?

18:10.386 --> 18:11.087
Within a week.

18:12.029 --> 18:14.272
Because it took that long to do all the auditions.

18:14.453 --> 18:14.733
All right.

18:14.974 --> 18:22.645
I mean, we do, we could only do so many during the time allotted because they had classes and we had to work around all that.

18:23.166 --> 18:26.631
But usually within a week, they would know.

18:27.292 --> 18:33.662
As the enrollment grew, did the number of auditions?

18:35.064 --> 18:35.926
Yeah, sure did.

18:36.567 --> 18:40.112
We'd audition, or say back in,

18:41.122 --> 18:45.714
Oh, 70 to 75, 1975.

18:46.276 --> 18:52.132
We'd audition sometimes as many as 200 young men to fill 20 slots.

18:53.054 --> 18:54.779
So you're saying 10 to 1?

18:55.080 --> 18:56.363
Yeah, about that.

18:56.950 --> 19:02.357
It varied from year to year, of course, and it was considerably different second semester auditions.

19:02.877 --> 19:03.899
There'd be fewer of them.

19:05.140 --> 19:06.782
And we'd have fewer slots to fill, too.

19:06.802 --> 19:09.486
We usually have to fill six or seven slots.

19:09.506 --> 19:24.865
Once they got a positive response to their audition, then their, I'll call it hazing, as they began, what was the routine that they went through as a new member of the

19:25.655 --> 19:28.119
Well, we had what we called a red book.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.826
We also had a handbook that we gave each new buffo.

19:32.227 --> 19:35.312
They were telling the rules and regulations of this organization.

19:38.318 --> 19:41.243
But we had a red book that had all the school songs in it.

19:42.886 --> 19:46.212
And that was the first thing they had to do, learn school songs.

19:46.934 --> 19:55.604
And that would be one of the things some of the old men would have them do as a qualifying answer, a cush question.

19:59.088 --> 20:06.957
They'd have to recite or sing one of the school songs, like the second verse and things like that.

20:06.977 --> 20:12.443
They'd try to sneak around it.

20:13.484 --> 20:16.047
Once they started rehearsals,

20:17.377 --> 20:26.406
which would be like probably a week after their acceptance, they knew they were probationary members.

20:27.507 --> 20:39.660
And if they couldn't fulfill the Bufo requirements of like getting every man's signature, learning what they were supposed to learn, memorize what they were supposed to memorize, they could be dropped.

20:40.861 --> 20:42.243
Rarely did we do that.

20:42.443 --> 20:46.607
Most of them took it so seriously I was afraid they were going to flunk out of school.

20:46.756 --> 20:56.357
I really never did understand the whole time I was there how they could do as much as we had to do and still stay in school, but they did, most of them.

20:56.377 --> 21:03.853
I mean, we had some that flunked out, but if their grades went down, they had to drop out of the group and they could come back in

21:04.407 --> 21:22.990
if they could prove they've you know with their record record they would improve it did you have a gpa minimum 2.5 2.5 okay and was it normal for a young man who qualified as a freshman to remain four years

21:24.303 --> 21:25.044
Three to four.

21:25.725 --> 21:27.749
Again, it depended on their program.

21:28.711 --> 21:33.439
Of course, a lot of the engineers were five-year students.

21:35.422 --> 21:38.267
Vet students were longer.

21:40.591 --> 21:44.738
But most of them, yeah, if they maintained the grades, they stayed.

21:45.159 --> 21:47.222
I had one guy.

21:48.147 --> 22:12.805
uh jim kane who was in the single that's 18 semesters from his freshman year through his doctor uh you're saying phd doctor yeah was that as far as you know the record that yes that is the record as far as i know who is jim where's jim today executive now with uh i think it's with

22:12.785 --> 22:16.371
Not Phillips gasoline, but the British Phillips company.

22:16.611 --> 22:20.016
Oh BP Amoco, I believe.

22:20.357 --> 22:20.597
Okay.

22:20.617 --> 22:28.590
Anyway, he's in Houston and I mean one of the first good tenors I had and he sang oh happy day.

22:29.070 --> 22:40.969
That was his which were in terms of the different Voice specialties that you needed which was the hardest to find in the early days first tenors and

22:41.607 --> 22:44.354
Now I understand its basis.

22:45.036 --> 22:47.843
And it's because of the society.

22:48.484 --> 22:52.013
The kids today are hearing all this screaming, yelling, rock!

22:52.394 --> 22:53.878
And so they're becoming tenors.

22:54.972 --> 23:00.759
But it's hard to find a good solid bass like Albert Laredo, you know, or Fred McClure.

23:01.620 --> 23:06.566
Fred sang second tenor for us.

23:06.746 --> 23:08.448
That's an interesting story if you have time.

23:08.708 --> 23:09.349
Oh, yes.

23:09.429 --> 23:10.510
We want to talk about Fred.

23:12.293 --> 23:19.641
When he came in the group, we had had a few blacks audition, but most of them didn't make it.

23:19.661 --> 23:22.785
Well, none of them made it until Fred came along.

23:23.238 --> 23:25.261
Fred is the first black member of the singing cadet?

23:26.403 --> 23:26.563
Yeah.

23:27.424 --> 23:33.674
And of course, all the guys knew that this black guy was going to be a member of the singing cadet.

23:34.675 --> 23:39.823
So in those days, our rehearsal chairs were white leatherette.

23:40.063 --> 23:44.350
And we had moved into the new section in MSC, 1974.

23:45.392 --> 23:47.875
But our chairs were all white leatherette.

23:47.895 --> 23:50.359
So we knew where he was going to be seated.

23:50.677 --> 23:56.113
So the guys draped his chair in black, you know, one black chair and all these white seats.

23:56.937 --> 24:00.321
And everybody called him the raisin and the rice pudding.

24:01.082 --> 24:01.963
And he just loved it.

24:02.764 --> 24:03.525
And we loved him.

24:03.945 --> 24:07.289
I mean, he I was reading through some letters I had for me last night.

24:09.632 --> 24:10.593
I sang at his wedding.

24:13.055 --> 24:15.278
This wonderful guy.

24:15.518 --> 24:25.830
Why was Fred such a splendid role model as the first outstanding black student leader at Texas A&M?

24:25.810 --> 24:31.516
I think, well, he certainly owes it to his parents, number one, I think.

24:31.936 --> 24:38.222
But his work and experience with FFA really toned him up.

24:38.442 --> 24:39.804
I mean, really toned him.

24:40.304 --> 24:50.775
He became a marvelous speaker and a kind and generous guy, a very compassionate person.

24:50.795 --> 24:52.316
And a tireless sense of humor.

24:52.757 --> 24:53.497
Oh, yes.

24:53.838 --> 24:54.298
Oh, yes.

24:55.257 --> 24:56.640
And all kinds of humor.

24:59.787 --> 25:03.956
We hear about, we say, Aggies tell more Aggie jokes than anybody else.

25:04.337 --> 25:08.326
Well Fred told more black jokes than anybody else.

25:08.346 --> 25:10.330
He was just hilarious, just wonderful.

25:10.900 --> 25:15.105
And we all loved it had hated to lose him when he came student body president.

25:15.145 --> 25:16.286
We had to lose him, of course.

25:16.647 --> 25:16.867
All right.

25:16.907 --> 25:18.048
So he was in two years.

25:18.168 --> 25:18.689
He was into.

25:18.769 --> 25:19.109
OK.

25:21.572 --> 25:22.033
Let's see.

25:22.373 --> 25:25.016
Oh, back to.

25:25.256 --> 25:29.021
And new members getting in and so forth.

25:29.041 --> 25:36.009
Did you ever encounter seeing cadets physically hazing a new member?

25:37.791 --> 25:39.473
Paddles or anything like that?

25:39.493 --> 25:40.073
No, no, no, no.

25:40.093 --> 25:40.654
No paddles.

25:41.090 --> 25:48.408
But I remember there used to be, after auditions, there used to be what we called a bufo party.

25:49.691 --> 25:56.567
And five of the singing cadets lived in what used to be

25:57.290 --> 26:01.517
the red lighthouse south of College Station on Highway 6.

26:02.139 --> 26:03.361
We called it the Slut Hut.

26:04.002 --> 26:08.249
It was a, quote, massage parlor.

26:08.390 --> 26:09.271
The girls moved out.

26:09.572 --> 26:10.654
The city closed them down.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.178
And five of my singadets moved in there.

26:13.218 --> 26:15.101
So that became the singadet house, you know.

26:15.903 --> 26:19.349
Well, that's where they had the party, UFO party.

26:20.511 --> 26:22.234
Well...

26:23.395 --> 26:47.985
During the, quote, initiation exercises, they had the guys stripped down, they were still in their underwear and shoes, but they had to roll on the ground in this chicken house that had been, it had been a chicken house out back, and it was still covered with chicken manure everywhere.

26:49.045 --> 26:56.778
Well, I got wind of that later, and so did, I think, General Hannigan.

27:00.284 --> 27:00.945
Colonel Hannigan.

27:02.748 --> 27:06.995
Anyway, we stopped that very quick.

27:07.556 --> 27:10.220
To my knowledge, we never had any paddling.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.442
We had push-ups.

27:11.843 --> 27:14.286
Give me ten, give me twenty, you know, whatever.

27:15.027 --> 27:30.746
But to my knowledge, and of course as I was telling you the snuggies on the bus, on the bus tours we'd have the Bufos all crammed into the on-bus laboratory in the back of the bus.

27:30.766 --> 27:32.788
You know ten of them, fifteen of them.

27:34.574 --> 27:42.906
But we never, to my knowledge really and truly, we never had paddling.

27:44.048 --> 27:56.025
And we really got kind of incensed when people kept telling us the fact that they were wearing that key was a form of hazing.

27:56.005 --> 27:58.309
Well, we didn't think of it as hazing.

27:58.329 --> 28:06.323
We thought of it as good PR and good brotherhood, good fellowship program.

28:06.583 --> 28:19.465
But I think Dr. Adair headed up that program to get rid of those keys.

28:20.525 --> 28:23.349
And I don't know if I think they're still trying to get rid of them.

28:23.850 --> 28:24.831
I hope they never do.

28:25.512 --> 28:27.795
Because it's a thing of pride.

28:27.835 --> 28:31.440
All these guys who had them, have them hanging in their homes.

28:31.801 --> 28:34.364
I mean, it's a symbol of pride.

28:36.848 --> 28:41.554
Did alcohol ever become a problem in a scene cadet activity?

28:43.272 --> 28:48.721
Yes, but we stopped that almost immediately.

28:49.122 --> 28:55.372
But every year, everywhere we'd go on tour, particularly, the guys would stay in host homes.

28:57.175 --> 28:58.497
Well, I had a couple of them.

28:59.742 --> 29:03.366
overly imbibe in a host home.

29:03.647 --> 29:09.294
And the host was just trying to make them feel comfortable at home, you know, unloading them up.

29:09.954 --> 29:13.138
And these kids were 17 years old, 18 years old.

29:14.220 --> 29:15.241
So we stopped that.

29:16.522 --> 29:22.830
We passed a rule saying you may have one drink, no more.

29:24.633 --> 29:27.717
But we never got into fist fights or anything.

29:28.398 --> 29:32.203
Of course, the only time I ever, the guys took care of those problems.

29:33.625 --> 29:40.395
The only time I ever interfered in any disciplinary measure was if it were on a moral basis, morals basis.

29:40.956 --> 29:45.662
Stealing, lying, cheating, homosexuality.

29:47.768 --> 29:56.084
We fought that, and a lot of people still don't understand why we fought the homosexual thing so badly, so hard.

29:56.845 --> 30:08.848
But in my mind, we were going out representing the university, staying in people's homes, and if one guy, just one guy, put the move on some

30:10.212 --> 30:15.002
host kids or something, that would destroy the scene.

30:15.022 --> 30:15.884
It would be the end.

30:17.167 --> 30:19.412
So we were very careful about that.

30:19.432 --> 30:20.033
I missed some.

30:20.093 --> 30:20.995
I know that I did.

30:22.639 --> 30:25.745
But they behaved themselves.

30:25.905 --> 30:29.453
They became some of the very sharp people, and most of them are.

30:29.939 --> 30:33.282
Did you ever have to suspend, kick some out?

30:34.063 --> 30:34.523
Just one.

30:34.783 --> 30:35.184
Just one.

30:35.504 --> 30:38.026
I mean, for that purpose, for that reason.

30:38.086 --> 30:51.938
No, I've kicked guys out, usually, they kick themselves out, actually, by not coming to rehearsals, by skipping rehearsals, not being on time, missing the bus.

30:52.979 --> 30:59.305
In fact, I remember one young man, we put off the bus in Brady, Texas,

30:59.875 --> 31:01.018
Run her hometown.

31:02.021 --> 31:04.527
And it was snowing.

31:04.567 --> 31:05.790
We were on a January tour.

31:06.833 --> 31:07.896
And we put him off the bus.

31:07.916 --> 31:08.939
He said, get home, boy.

31:09.179 --> 31:10.162
Best way you know how.

31:10.783 --> 31:14.914
He was just being undisciplined on bus two.
