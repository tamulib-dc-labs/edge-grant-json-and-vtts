WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:05.868
This is our second interview with General 
Harrington. Today is August 13, I believe. This is

00:12.179 --> 00:13.341
Terry Anderson. Last time we got through your 
command of the 823rd Air Division in Florida, and

00:13.381 --> 00:25.161
then we were just starting. your military 
assistance advisory group in Japan. Let's

00:30.558 --> 00:33.182
continue talking about that. Tell me what your 
functions and duties were there. Well, your

00:38.509 --> 00:56.515
functions as the Air Force chief of the MAG group, 
military assistance group, was to provide

00:38.509 --> 00:56.515
technical assistance to the Chief of Staff of the 
Japanese Air Defense Force. Oh, that's right,

01:01.109 --> 01:02.691
yeah. And to also provide logistics support and 
spare parts, things of this sort, to keep their

01:04.032 --> 01:13.303
airplanes flying. Right, yeah. Yeah, we were 
talking about this yesterday. And you were

01:17.308 --> 01:26.239
talking about the relationships that you had, or 
the relations that you had with the Japanese

01:17.308 --> 01:26.239
bureaucrats now that Japan was an independent 
nation. Could you touch on that? Well you had

01:28.304 --> 01:57.906
almost a twice a week meeting with the chief of 
staff of the Japanese Air Defense Force General

01:28.304 --> 01:57.906
Sanagi and I would say at least once a month

01:28.304 --> 01:57.906
my staff along with my staff would make field trips 
go out to the various Japanese bases and really get

01:28.304 --> 01:57.906
on the spot look at how they were doing rather than 
just looking at the mechanics, statistics that

01:58.358 --> 02:06.570
were sent in. And I probably operated a little 
differently because in my inspection procedures

02:08.032 --> 02:27.100
I would open drawers and open doors that were 
closed just to see what was what kind of skeletons

02:28.565 --> 02:30.727
were in the closets. And as I mentioned yesterday, 
this is where I found numerous

02:30.747 --> 02:47.985
starters, generators, spare parts that were 
inoperable, but could be repaired. And although

02:48.025 --> 02:54.833
the Japanese didn't particularly like that 
method, they condoned it. Say the American

02:55.253 --> 02:58.116
taxpayers, I would imagine. What did your 
superiors think of that? Well, they thought that

03:01.199 --> 03:03.722
was a real good idea. I mean, because they really 
hadn't thought about the fact that the Japanese

03:04.243 --> 03:21.800
labor pay scale was such that they could 
economically repair these if the United States

03:04.243 --> 03:21.800
provided them with the bits and pieces to do the 
overhauling. And we established a program like

03:21.820 --> 03:24.643
that. How did you get along with the Japanese 
people now that you went back ten years after?

03:33.925 --> 03:44.201
Well, the Japanese

03:33.925 --> 03:44.201
people were always, to me, very courteous. I'm 
sure that we in the United States would have been

03:45.303 --> 03:50.631
belligerent whereas the Japanese thought well we 
must have something and they wanted to copy us. And

03:58.083 --> 04:02.027
I got along with the Japanese real well. What was 
the quality of their Air Force in the late 1950s?

04:09.154 --> 04:15.741
Well they really had, see we

04:09.154 --> 04:15.741
provided them with the F-86. Now the F-86 was an 
obsolete airplane, almost. It's what you'd

04:21.678 --> 04:26.743
probably call a second line airplane when we ride 
it with them. And it was probably a good stepping

04:26.803 --> 04:28.825
stone. It certainly wasn't up to the F-100 that we 
were using on our bases. But it was a real good

04:39.436 --> 04:44.901
training vehicle.

04:48.087 --> 04:55.057
I would say that we got our money's worth out of the 
F-86s that we provided them. Did they complain

04:55.077 --> 04:59.122
that they were getting second rate or used 
equipment? No, I mean, I guess they didn't want to

04:59.142 --> 05:04.209
look a gift horse in the mouth. They were being 
given to them, so they were... And we provided

05:04.249 --> 05:13.762
logistic support for them. And, of course, we 
shipped them a lot of stuff that they probably

05:13.782 --> 05:17.267
didn't need, like when the F-86 was first 
purchased while we anticipated so many wing

05:18.260 --> 05:26.790
changes. Well, it didn't turn out that we needed 
nearly as much replacement wings as we

05:27.811 --> 05:42.187
anticipated, but we shipped the Japanese all 
these wings, so they had to store them. So we had

05:42.207 --> 05:47.693
warehouse after warehouse full of wings that 
would never do really them any good. What'd they do

05:50.593 --> 05:52.175
with them? What'd they do? They stored them. 
Probably still have them. Yeah, they still have

05:55.200 --> 05:55.821
them. And the other thing with the Japanese and 
looking back at them, we provided them with

05:56.602 --> 06:08.360
computers on stock control and things of this 
sort. But they really didn't at that time believe

06:08.380 --> 06:12.386
in computers. They still kept everything by hand. 
Every, almost every nut bolt and screw that when we

06:18.132 --> 06:38.553
repaired an airplane why we had a bench stock that 
we just rolled out to the airplane and used

06:18.132 --> 06:38.553
whatever we needed and when we got back in why 
somebody replaced, poured some more screws in

06:18.132 --> 06:38.553
there without counting them or anything of this 
sort. Japanese they counted every bolt, every

06:38.573 --> 06:42.236
screw, everything that was used. I mean it's, they 
did it very meticulous.

06:49.317 --> 06:57.088
And so they kept our system and they continued to 
use their old system that they had been using for

06:49.317 --> 06:57.088
years and years and years. I bet you were happy to 
become the commander of the 39th Air Division to

06:57.108 --> 07:01.914
get your own command again. Yeah, I worked at that. 
How? Well, I went over to see Joan Burns and see if he

07:05.179 --> 07:10.566
had an opening. And they kept in touch with the 
commander of 5th Air Force. And I was always out. I

07:19.060 --> 07:29.330
had to go out to see him at least once a week anyway on 
briefing monostas of the Japanese air because

07:19.060 --> 07:29.330
they were part of the defense of Japan. And we 
depended on them to

07:29.490 --> 07:39.760
patrol certain segments of certain areas of 
Japan. And so I was out there about once a week to a

07:40.499 --> 07:45.165
staff meeting. So I just... To give them the elbow. 
Yeah, well, that's part of your duty, and also

07:49.551 --> 07:59.144
during that time you could promote

07:49.551 --> 07:59.144
a job. Now, let's talk about Japanese air 
defenses. What percentage of the total air

08:03.810 --> 08:08.697
defense was American? What percent was Japanese. 
How'd you work that relationship? Oh, I would say

08:13.799 --> 08:20.148
that during that period of time they were just 
becoming combat. I would probably estimate maybe

08:20.308 --> 08:23.312
25 percent. Like the Japanese had Hokkaido and 
Misawa was the most northern American base. So we

08:34.147 --> 08:35.869
turned over all of the the air defense of Hokkaido 
to them.

08:46.551 --> 08:57.849
Then there were other areas over on the Sea of Japan 
that they had air bases over there that they could

08:46.551 --> 08:57.849
scramble fighters for intercept.

09:00.974 --> 09:01.755
So it was Well, we were tied into their air command 
and their control centers too. It was just a joint

09:09.266 --> 09:14.252
cooperative effort, sort of like NATO? Well, 
yeah, you had, like Basava, we had an air division

09:14.272 --> 09:27.787
headquarters of the Japanese Air Self Defense 
Force, and then we had an air division

09:14.272 --> 09:27.787
headquarters of the Air Force. And jointly we had a 
control center. And we ran a control center next

09:33.410 --> 09:37.076
door. The Japanese ran their control center so 
that they all were just tied together. And of

09:42.764 --> 10:01.172
course, we and

09:42.764 --> 10:01.172
our GCA,

09:42.764 --> 10:01.172
our ground controlled approaches, instrument 
landing type of thing, why the Japanese had their

10:01.996 --> 10:06.982
own and we had our own. The Japanese, we taught them 
English. Yeah, I was going to ask about that. What

10:12.750 --> 10:14.091
about the language barrier? But when the Japanese 
really got into stress of why they'd go to

10:14.151 --> 10:27.088
Japanese, so you didn't know what they were saying 
particularly. Was there much of a language

10:27.248 --> 10:30.552
barrier?

10:31.713 --> 10:43.368
I would say the same as in almost any foreign 
country where you have a completely foreign

10:31.713 --> 10:43.368
language. I took a language course in Japanese and 
my wife did so that we at least could talk to the

10:55.912 --> 11:00.456
politicians or the individuals who didn't speak 
any English at all. Oh, could you? I mean, you could

11:01.197 --> 11:03.680
start a conversation? Yeah, you could carry on a 
reasonable conversation as to the courtesies of

11:03.700 --> 11:13.309
the day. And they gave you a sort of a staff and wife 
officer program? Or how did they work it? And was it

11:22.738 --> 11:24.720
stressed? This is through the Air Force, right? 
No, well, the wives and getting back to the mag.

11:33.999 --> 11:34.539
Yeah. While Johnson Augie and all his chiefs, 
their wives would come out and take cooking

11:35.240 --> 11:45.952
lessons from the Americans. Really? Oh, yeah. Oh, 
yeah. So they... From the American wives? Yeah,

11:50.857 --> 11:54.201
from my wife and... and the other members of the MAG 
staff. And they in turn would run a

11:57.055 --> 12:08.210
Japanese-English course. And then of course I had 
as my right hand a Nisi that was fluent in Japanese

12:08.230 --> 12:19.665
and fluent in English. So, and he accompanied me 
almost every, he did accommodate me everywhere I

12:20.101 --> 12:25.648
went. So, you always had somebody who could bail 
you out as far as the language program was

12:25.988 --> 12:37.863
concerned. And you had the same thing. Was he a 
civilian or was he in the Air Force? He was a

12:40.366 --> 12:41.307
civilian. He was a civilian.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.775
all properties, GS-9, GS-11. He was a civil 
service civilian. He was American.

12:53.662 --> 13:06.619
And then each section, the operations, and each 
one of them had an interpreter so that when they

12:53.662 --> 13:06.619
went out by themselves, they could take someone 
with them. You were talking earlier about Curtis

13:07.300 --> 13:11.505
LeMay and how he stressed how important it was for 
the staff wives to welcome others into the Air

13:12.076 --> 13:21.327
Force community, things like that. And then you 
mentioned again here about your wife and the wives

13:22.188 --> 13:29.878
of the Japanese generals getting together. Was 
there a lot of this social contact with the

13:30.158 --> 13:39.329
Japanese and with the relations very good in that 
sense? Oh, yeah. When I was on the embassy staff at

13:42.586 --> 13:57.139
that time, you had, you were always a lot more than I 
really enjoyed. Cocktail parties, or anybody who

13:57.680 --> 14:12.373
came in, high ranking Air Force,

13:57.680 --> 14:12.373
my Japanese always wine and diamond. and you were a 
part of that program. And then of course the Cherry

14:15.965 --> 14:33.845
Blossom time, they always invited you to, gave you 
tickets to that and you got a grand reception and

14:15.965 --> 14:33.845
a front seat on that time. No, they pampered you 
quite a bit. Well, I mean it was in their best

14:36.167 --> 14:41.533
interest that they do pamper you quite a bit. And 
that was just, it seemed to me, part of your duty.

14:46.753 --> 14:52.219
And when you got up to 5th Air Force, it was more of a 
formal type of thing. When a Japanese general came

14:53.019 --> 15:07.053
up to inspect the Japanese, sometimes they 
wouldn't even contact you. However,

15:10.943 --> 15:24.660
At Misawa we established a maintenance program 
that,

15:10.943 --> 15:24.660
well we went nine months without an aircraft 
accident, but a single airplane accident. So the

15:25.200 --> 15:27.143
Japanese were very interested in that. So 
everybody and his brother from the Japanese Air

15:27.163 --> 15:38.917
Defense Force came up to copy what you were looking 
at. What were you doing? What were you doing right?

15:41.878 --> 15:51.007
Nine months you had, as a commander of the 39th Air 
Division, you had 100 jet aircraft and you had nine

15:41.878 --> 15:51.007
months without a single accident. You must have 
been doing something right. Well, the first thing

15:52.528 --> 16:09.604
I did when I first got up there is, and you probably 
couldn't do that in this day and age, but I had the

15:52.528 --> 16:09.604
judge give me a list of all the names of individuals 
who had been picked up drunken disorderly at least

16:10.158 --> 16:21.497
two times and any other serious offense. And I 
just, and then I had... Enlisted men and officers?

16:26.666 --> 16:30.853
Enlisted, no, the highest ranking was a 
lieutenant colonel.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.862
And there were various type of offenses. sleeping 
with a Japanese girl when he had a wife and kids and

16:36.213 --> 16:42.960
this type of thing. I mean, I just didn't tolerate 
that type of thing. So I just shipped them all home.

16:46.764 --> 16:47.184
Really? Oh, yeah. You could ship them all. I 
shipped about 250 home. You shipped 250? How many

16:52.750 --> 16:55.333
you had here as the commander? You had 13,000 
personnel here. as a commander under your

17:00.867 --> 17:03.831
responsibility. And you shipped 250 of them home, 
officers and men? Two officers and men. And a lot of

17:09.039 --> 17:13.025
these men were career men. Well, see, General 
Burns, when he gave me the job, he said, Tex, I'll

17:13.325 --> 17:18.974
give you three months. And that outfit up there is 
being operated kind of a country club. and their

17:29.200 --> 17:32.484
accident rate was about to worsen the Air Force. 
Really? And so I granted all the airplanes, first

17:33.345 --> 17:38.652
thing. And then I talked to every— Okay, why did you 
do that? Well, because they were— Why did you

17:42.778 --> 17:45.061
ground them all immediately? Weren't properly 
maintained. Okay, okay. You wanted to get them

17:49.327 --> 17:51.189
back on a maintenance schedule. Then I got the 
master sergeants, the supervisors, and we

17:51.209 --> 17:58.819
unbuttoned. every airplane inspected gave them a 
real thorough inspection and looked for cracks

17:59.170 --> 18:28.148
and so you got all the technical man you got all the 
people out of the offices who were real

17:59.170 --> 18:28.148
professionals out on the front line looking at 
airplanes and then then you took this program of

17:59.170 --> 18:28.148
shipping all these people home and and that really 
is very drastic. It goes over the base real

18:31.685 --> 18:33.548
thoroughly. I

18:34.269 --> 18:56.042
remember the day I arrived up there I was picked up 
at the airport and I was driving to my quarters and

18:34.269 --> 18:56.042
there was some sergeant that just looked at you and 
you had a star on your and he didn't salute, didn't

18:56.393 --> 18:58.917
do anything. So I stopped, backed up, and got out 
and chewed him out a little bit. Was he a guard? No,

19:07.151 --> 19:09.474
he was just a sergeant, just looking. Maybe he was 
so shocked to see a general coming in. Well, he had a

19:16.305 --> 19:20.933
general commanded before.

19:21.959 --> 19:25.824
And then one of the squadron commanders, I picked 
him up on base for speeding. I was following him in

19:27.466 --> 19:31.231
my civilian car at the time. It was probably two or 
three weeks later. And I chewed him out. And of

19:35.677 --> 19:43.026
course the Lois and the two girls were with me then, 
so they kind of ducked down. They didn't want

19:43.106 --> 19:49.114
anybody to see them while I was doing my duty. And I 
just didn't want anybody who was going out getting

19:49.550 --> 19:57.552
drunk all night and working on airplanes during 
the daytime.

19:58.747 --> 20:00.529
In fact, I had a young airman come in. He said, I 
said, John, I said, I'm sorry that I'm going home. I

20:05.155 --> 20:10.102
wish I, well, I weren't, but I'm sure that if you had 
been here, I wouldn't be sent home. I mean, the

20:10.222 --> 20:18.492
standards were such that you just thought that was 
the thing to do, or no one really cared. What did you

20:18.793 --> 20:20.535
say, how did you answer that? Well I said, well I'm 
sorry you have to go home too, but I said that's the

20:20.515 --> 20:30.136
way, I said you can get over this, it's no problem. I 
mean being sent home before being drunk is

20:30.156 --> 20:40.077
disorderly, why if you just take it in stride and 
not,

20:41.525 --> 20:44.509
make you think that you are a complete failure. 
Why, you're really not. I mean, it's just one of

20:45.791 --> 20:49.196
those obstacles that you have to face. What rank 
was this? This is an enlisted man? Oh, he was about a

20:51.119 --> 20:52.862
corporal or something. A real clean-cut young 
man. And you could, you probably could have begged

20:56.467 --> 20:58.951
exception. But you make an exception to him, why do 
you have to beg exception to everybody else? And

21:03.618 --> 21:10.688
we worked out pretty well, because only Only about 
two or three congressional inquiries came in. You

21:15.040 --> 21:17.383
always had the problem of congressional 
inquiries. Somebody's parents write their

21:17.503 --> 21:23.811
congressman, and your congressman writes their 
secretary of defense, and the secretary of

21:17.503 --> 21:23.811
defense comes on down. It just happened that the 
three that they inquired about were the worst

21:24.512 --> 21:29.298
offenders. I mean, you know, therefore, I got off 
real... And I'll agree that we probably sent 25%

21:29.399 --> 21:39.932
home that we could have... of

21:40.537 --> 21:46.362
probably improve and they would have never done it 
again. Now what do you mean when you say you sent

21:46.402 --> 21:48.564
them home? You sent them to a base in the States? No, 
you had authority on the Air Force regulations at

21:51.086 --> 22:09.683
the time to discharge individuals who did not

21:51.086 --> 22:09.683
become accustomed to the Air Force live. It was a 
real easy program to have. So these people were

22:14.865 --> 22:16.267
discharged? They were discharged from the Air 
Force. Dishonorable or undesirable or general?

22:20.772 --> 22:22.073
Undesirable. Really? Well, I say a general. It 
wasn't a good conduct discharge. It was the next

22:27.379 --> 22:29.261
lower level. A general discharge? Yeah.

22:37.220 --> 22:52.122
And then after you get your airplanes inspected, 
and then after you get the people who are carousing

22:37.220 --> 22:52.122
out of your way, well then you can start building an 
Air Force. And before I went up there, I'd gone over

22:52.383 --> 23:06.484
to the Fifth Air Force and made up little cards on 
each individual, and got a picture, and also what

22:52.383 --> 23:06.484
is the, efficiency reports were, so that when I got 
up there, I knew who the officers were that had the

23:06.785 --> 23:20.619
most, that had the best record, and the captains, 
the majors, the lieutenant colonels. And so I

23:21.560 --> 23:35.053
looked at the standpoint of the standardization 
team that tested everybody, all the pilots, as to

23:21.560 --> 23:35.053
whether or not they were doing a good job. And I got 
rid of the ones that were average and put in the

23:35.776 --> 23:44.330
outstanding pilots that had the best records in 
there. And then we started through and tested

23:44.350 --> 23:49.399
every pilot. We tested every pilot. And my 
position was on emergency exams, 98 is not good

23:52.043 --> 23:57.793
enough. I mean, you have to make 100. If you have an 
emergency exam and you fail two procedures, why,

24:01.358 --> 24:14.073
you just... Yeah, so you just, I insisted on 100%. 
And we set up some skill programs like tic-tac-toe

24:15.215 --> 24:29.492
programs so that each pilots would test each other 
by... by questions on airplane systems and flying

24:30.367 --> 24:38.174
techniques and things of this sort against each 
other. I got the wives clubs and the NCO wives clubs

24:40.776 --> 24:58.332
involved in setting up a

24:40.776 --> 24:58.332
ward program so that your crew chief who had had his 
airplane on the line ready to fly and flew his

24:58.717 --> 25:10.393
mission in any one month, why you give him a void of a 
hundred dollars or a trip for he and his wife down to

24:58.717 --> 25:10.393
Tokyo and this type of thing. I bet you that 
increased morale. Oh yeah. And whether or not they

25:18.245 --> 25:23.232
were colored or white or what have you didn't 
really make any difference. The procedure was

25:23.852 --> 25:27.137
that the one that Well, I set up a program, and this 
is a SAC program, what you'd call a tail number

25:28.045 --> 25:34.353
schedule. Each airplane had a number, 1, 2, 7, 6, 7, 
7, 6, 8, 7, 6, 9, on down. And then on the first of the

25:42.163 --> 25:48.571
month, prior to the first of the month, you'd set up 
a schedule. That airplane was going to fly on the

25:48.651 --> 25:57.242
3rd, the 8th, the 14th, the 4-hour mission, or 
whatever the mission was. And if the crew chief had

25:57.880 --> 26:16.049
that airplane ready to fly on the day they were 
scheduled to fly, and it flew all its missions

25:57.880 --> 26:16.049
during the month,

25:57.880 --> 26:16.049
then he was in competition for the best crew chief 
on base. And then the other thing is whatever

26:16.289 --> 26:22.639
discrepancies the pilot wrote up at the end of the 
mission. And then you'd get down and he flew his

26:23.294 --> 26:28.061
missions and no discrepancies as well. So 
sometimes you'd have a tie. But anyway, that got

26:32.186 --> 26:36.893
the airplanes in good condition. Where'd you get 
the money for this, to send the guy and his wife down

26:36.933 --> 26:41.199
to Tokyo? Well, the Oscars Wives Club and the NCO 
Wives Club, see, they had programs and cake sales

26:41.299 --> 26:50.652
and they had... They raised the money. I didn't 
care how they raised it. And then the commanders,

26:56.371 --> 27:15.053
each commander had a, I shouldn't call it a slush 
fund, he had a commander's fund that he could use

26:56.371 --> 27:15.053
for either entertainment or visiting 
dignitaries or what

26:56.371 --> 27:15.053
have you. And that was a big thing. Go down and pay 
somebody's train trip down and you had hotels in

27:16.749 --> 27:29.046
Tokyo that were taken over by the Air Force so they 
could stay at a rest hotel at two dollars a day or

27:16.749 --> 27:29.046
something of this sort. So that was a good big, big 
boost on morale. And then you work on the wives. The

27:39.922 --> 27:44.989
pilots, well if they drink a little too much one 
particular day why then he says they shouldn't be

27:45.526 --> 28:12.647
really be flying the next day so so you depending on 
the wives to help you out if he's going to fly the

27:45.526 --> 28:12.647
next day why keep him keep him off the bottle during 
the day during the night or during that evening and

27:45.526 --> 28:12.647
and did you go around and talk to the wives or did you 
oh i talked to i had a meeting of all the wives and

27:45.526 --> 28:12.647
that's one of the uh speeches as I let you read on 
that Basava wasn't as bad as all this, that

28:13.977 --> 28:27.825
happiness is not where you is, not a matter of 
geography type of thing. I made a talk to all the

28:27.926 --> 28:31.092
incoming wives and And I was probably... Of 
officers and enlisted? And enlisted. My

28:34.912 --> 28:38.596
goodness, you had 1,700 families there. Yeah, but 
see... You would have been talking almost every

28:38.736 --> 28:42.481
day. Well, no, 1,700, see, but you... Families, 
yeah. You just talk to them one time, and then you

28:46.245 --> 28:53.173
only talk to the ones that are coming in, the 
replacements, see? So maybe in one month, maybe

28:53.193 --> 28:59.460
you had only 20 new families arrive. So it's not 
really that... I see. So you just set up a meeting

29:01.825 --> 29:04.367
for those 20 at the end of the month? Yeah, you just 
set up a meeting and talked to the NCO wives and the

29:04.387 --> 29:14.816
officers' wives together, new families that came 
in. And you also normally talk to the officers and

29:15.657 --> 29:22.083
enlisted men who came in to get them. When I first 
arrived up there, I talked to every, I made a speech

29:24.725 --> 29:28.669
to every every individual on base. Tell them that 
I'm not the former commander. I'm a different type

29:36.354 --> 29:38.497
of individual. And I gave my

29:39.118 --> 29:50.516
philosophy on that I really didn't mind people 
drinking, but I detested the drunk. I mean, this

29:50.676 --> 29:51.658
type of thing. And that I expected if you're going 
to be pilot, I expect you to be the best pilot. And

29:58.514 --> 30:02.158
we're going to make this the best base in the Air 
Force. And we're going to not have any accidents. I

30:06.883 --> 30:17.155
mean it's just absolutely ridiculous to have an 
accident when an engine quits or something of this

30:06.883 --> 30:17.155
sort

30:06.883 --> 30:17.155
when it could be aborted. And I preach a little 
conservatism that if something was wrong with

30:20.337 --> 30:25.082
your airplane, don't push on. Come back to base and 
land. The safest place is on the ground and there

30:27.785 --> 30:32.610
will be another day to fly. And

30:32.731 --> 30:43.863
so they brought back airplanes that had to be 
continued while probably the engine would have

30:32.731 --> 30:43.863
quit or something of that sort. So

30:43.883 --> 30:48.808
you set up competition between squadrons on 
bombing competition and efficiency programs.

30:58.232 --> 31:01.636
And you had the best pilots. You had a roster in each 
squadron listing the best pilot, the best bombing

31:01.716 --> 31:15.370
pilot, and then the fighters. And so you could have 
them competing against each other. And it worked

31:19.422 --> 31:23.508
real good, I mean actually. And we had, well we had a 
lot of

31:23.848 --> 31:37.808
colored pilots at that time, not a lot I'd say, but 
we had- About what percentage? Oh I'd say maybe,

31:37.828 --> 31:41.273
well one of the squadrons,
