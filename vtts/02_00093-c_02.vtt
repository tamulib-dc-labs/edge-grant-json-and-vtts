to an eclectic level and a high level of income, an erudite level, whatever you would call it.

00:09.582 --> 00:11.924
And one of the theories is unbalanced growth.

00:12.325 --> 00:17.450
I think when I was being interviewed by Earl Rudder, he asked me, how do you make a great university?

00:17.730 --> 00:19.151
And you did ask me this before.

00:19.252 --> 00:21.434
Now my mind is triggered by it.

00:22.094 --> 00:30.583
I said I would follow what we call in economics, and I wrote an article, by the way, on this subject back in that period of time, on unbalanced growth economics.

00:30.763 --> 00:36.028
How to develop a country, how to develop a region, spatial economics, how do you develop a region.

00:36.734 --> 00:41.198
You take advantage of what its basic comparative advantage is and you plug it.

00:42.279 --> 00:53.209
And if you've got a comparative advantage in engineering, well let's go ahead and boost it rapidly, the spillover benefits in time will go across the board.

00:54.010 --> 01:06.741
So I guess really to answer your million dollars now a little more specifically, I would pick out three or four areas that I could unbalance by really shoving it forward, if I could shove it far enough with the minion.

01:06.721 --> 01:15.769
And get those three areas, and that's for accidental thought, say, music.

01:16.970 --> 01:21.194
Let's imagine that the music area is so underprivileged here.

01:21.575 --> 01:28.361
But it can grow rapidly, and it could be so many spillover benefits, including all the way down to architecture or something.

01:29.021 --> 01:30.443
I would plug my money in there.

01:31.724 --> 01:35.327
But from my standpoint, I'd have to have my wife tell him what's going on.

01:35.830 --> 01:39.394
I know so little about music except turning on a record player.

01:40.876 --> 01:47.624
I would check with people I do know and respect and ask them what about their own fields.

01:47.904 --> 01:50.107
Last question.

01:50.727 --> 01:55.013
What feelings do you have for Texas A&M today in your heart?

01:57.816 --> 02:01.640
I wish we were a little more like back in the 80s and 70s.

02:02.561 --> 02:05.685
I'm disturbed very much by a couple of the stories that have come out.

02:06.391 --> 02:08.763
I think Ray Bowen has done a real fine job.

02:09.930 --> 02:14.393
In fact, one of my daughters had rented a house of he and his wife up in Dallas.

02:14.474 --> 02:23.106
My son-in-law, Glenn Blaylock, and my daughter, Pam, they rented a house and now they've moved into their own house.

02:23.747 --> 02:28.353
So I've known Ray in it, in a sense, indirectly that way and by other correspondences.

02:28.934 --> 02:31.217
And from what I knew, he was doing a great job.

02:31.858 --> 02:38.688
I don't like the fact that this student apparently was reprimanded for his statement.

02:38.708 --> 02:43.114
Certainly the kid is entitled to say whatever he wants to in this land of ours.

02:43.313 --> 02:45.135
And frankly, I happen to agree with the kid.

02:45.876 --> 02:53.707
I'll tell you, if I had any loss being said, what school would you send me to if you could tell me where to go?

02:53.727 --> 02:56.410
I've got one grandson going to Texas Tech.

02:56.430 --> 02:57.732
I'm not unhappy about that.

02:57.772 --> 02:59.054
I'd prefer he went to A&M.

03:00.075 --> 03:11.430
Academically, he may not qualify for A&M, but if he did, I'm not even sure he'd go here, but I would want him to go here, because I do like the idea of

03:13.688 --> 03:15.310
are the way we think at A&M.

03:15.570 --> 03:28.383
I don't want us to become too much like those Ivy League schools that used to be so great and in many ways are far from great now, in my opinion.

03:28.403 --> 03:29.925
And I'm including across the board.

03:29.945 --> 03:35.751
They still get most of the prestigious awards, and conceivably they have some of the best minds.

03:36.572 --> 03:43.459
But having known lots of those fellows, I'm not that impressed by where they are teaching or where they got their degrees.

03:45.464 --> 03:46.295
Let's quit there.
