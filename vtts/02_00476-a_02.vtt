WEBVTT

00:05.313 --> 00:10.578
So you'd had enough of the military and you didn't 
want to go back into a military setting. Yeah,

00:11.139 --> 00:19.087
you've got to go into it wholeheartedly again or 
stay out of it. So I decided that Texas A&M wasn't

00:20.488 --> 00:24.993
for me. My mission at that time was to get a college 
degree to satisfy my family. and then go do what I

00:32.903 --> 00:35.567
damn well pleased. Well, why did you go on 
eventually then to get a PhD? During that process,

00:39.472 --> 00:42.537
did you get interested in education? No,

00:43.458 --> 00:48.265
I taught a year. I made exceptionally good grades 
in Baylor because I always had to make good grades

00:49.487 --> 00:59.641
to carry that extra load. And so I reached the point 
along about 19, 22, where I could finish in one

01:04.561 --> 01:14.170
summer school at Baylor. While I was in summer 
school finishing the,

01:16.372 --> 01:34.568
to get the diploma ahead of the game, a

01:16.372 --> 01:34.568
teacher, a superintendent from little town up 
close to Corsicana. Came down and was begging a

01:38.815 --> 01:58.072
fellow that had taught school under him 
previously to come back up there and be principal

01:38.815 --> 01:58.072
of his high school for another year or two at Lemon 
Grove. This guy says, I can't accept the job. He

02:01.796 --> 02:03.357
says, I'm offered a college job up at Benton in the 
math department as an instructor. If I can get my

02:11.459 --> 02:20.731
foot on the ladder with a college, I should do that 
rather than messing around with high schools

02:11.459 --> 02:20.731
anymore. And he says, so he said, well, have you a 
friend down here that could do the job? He says,

02:30.803 --> 02:33.647
yeah, there he is, walking across the campus. 
Well, that happened to be me. And he says, you can do

02:36.706 --> 02:42.174
any damn thing he wants to. And if you can persuade 
him to take this job, he says, I'll call him over

02:42.194 --> 02:47.802
here. Well, on that recommendation, he offered me 
a job up there. Of course, we had quite a

02:53.390 --> 02:55.693
conversation about it. He paid a good salary for 
nine months. I had just turned down a job on a

03:01.522 --> 03:14.582
newspaper that offered me $25 a week for the first 
six weeks. And if at the end of the six weeks I was

03:15.984 --> 03:23.415
still making good, they'd raise my salary to $30 a 
week. And by God, from there on I was on my own. That

03:30.530 --> 03:32.673
was the journalistic world. Well, in competition 
with $160 a month for nine months, only nine

03:34.195 --> 03:56.685
months, at Blooming Grove under this very fine 
fellow

03:34.195 --> 03:56.685
that was really hard up for, what he was trying to do 
was to get another man or two on the faculty besides

03:34.195 --> 03:56.685
himself. See, man. I went up there and I finished 
that job and

04:00.702 --> 04:26.665
went back down to Baylor and the old dean that, I 
can't think of his name at the moment,

04:00.702 --> 04:26.665
says, how did you get along teaching school up 
there? I said, well, I enjoyed teaching school. I

04:31.583 --> 04:34.988
says, they had me doing every damn thing under the 
sun.

04:38.333 --> 04:53.114
If they organized, they didn't have enough boys to 
really organize a football team, but they did

04:38.333 --> 04:53.114
scrape together about 15 that

04:38.333 --> 04:53.114
got suits up for them, and I says, I wound up 
coaching the team. I says, I didn't know how to

04:54.275 --> 04:58.221
throw a football. I says, everything that 
happened. And furthermore, the churches had

05:05.712 --> 05:21.611
apparently decided that they had, each one of 
them, the Baptist church was entitled to half the

05:05.712 --> 05:21.611
faculty, and the Methodist church was entitled to 
the other half. Well, I didn't fit into either

05:22.532 --> 05:25.576
half. So I wasn't gonna take on any, Each one of 
them, yeah, sure, we need somebody to teach this,

05:31.051 --> 05:36.196
teach that. Everything, every extracurricular 
piece of work that came up, I had to do it. I told him,

05:43.243 --> 05:51.711
I says, I enjoy teaching, but I says, I was 
reelected. But he said, if I can get a college job

05:51.731 --> 05:58.358
where I, responsible only for teaching and 
papers. I says, I think that'd be pretty good, but

06:03.868 --> 06:20.250
if you haven't got anything like that, or if the 
placement bureau here can't offer me something

06:03.868 --> 06:20.250
better than that, then I'm quitting the teaching 
profession. And

06:20.671 --> 06:26.899
he said, well, you shouldn't do that. He gave me 
quite a song and dance. flattered me about my

06:29.793 --> 06:38.845
record for A's and honor points and all that stuff. 
And said, you, the teaching, you ought to stay in

06:38.865 --> 06:48.579
it. And so I said, well, you can tell that to the 
placement bureau here. Something comes along.

06:59.780 --> 07:00.801
let me know.

07:05.227 --> 07:15.820
This was actually at the, I'd already told them 
that I wasn't coming back to Blooming Grove, but I

07:05.227 --> 07:15.820
was still, I went back to work up there. And before I 
finished the job,

07:17.021 --> 07:27.694
I got an offer from

07:17.021 --> 07:27.694
Gulf Coast Military Academy. and to teach

07:29.497 --> 07:43.817
just about whatever I could teach that they might 
want you to teach.

07:44.618 --> 07:59.419
So, I took a shot at that and got down there and in a 
way it was worse than blooming a grove because

08:00.395 --> 08:12.513
There, I

08:00.395 --> 08:12.513
became what they called a tactical officer in 
addition to my other duties. My other duties were a

08:13.775 --> 08:18.301
full-time teaching schedule in the forenoon. I 
was off the rest of the afternoon until drill time,

08:19.924 --> 08:29.878
and at drill time, I was out there on the drill 
field, keeping an eye on my particular company,

08:30.297 --> 08:38.368
which was the cadets in Company B. So here I was back 
in the military school without knowing it. They

08:44.496 --> 08:45.878
did pay well. They treated me handsomely. There 
was also night duty. I was billeted at one end of the

08:56.271 --> 08:59.916
dormitory that contained a battery of Company B. 
And the commandant of cadets there says, how is it

09:05.524 --> 09:12.390
that you're not in uniform? I said, hell, I'm not 
supposed to wear a uniform here. I'm a civilian. He

09:17.355 --> 09:18.777
says, to hell you are. I says, you're a tactical 
officer. I says, I wasn't hired as a tactical

09:22.521 --> 09:26.485
officer. Well, anyway, you're here and you're 
functioning. He says, I heard you dress down the

09:30.254 --> 09:40.367
company before going on parade, and you was in 
civilian clothes. He says, we can't have that. I

09:42.710 --> 09:44.152
says, what are you going to do about it? He says, 
well, we're going to commission you a second

09:45.333 --> 09:49.538
lieutenant of the reserve. Oh, I was going to ask 
you that, how you got in the reserves, and this is

09:49.558 --> 09:53.563
how. I'm going to give you a, Get your commission, 
second lieutenant of the reserve corps. I says,

10:03.027 --> 10:12.440
well,

10:03.027 --> 10:12.440
I said, I'm not taking any examination or 
anything. He says, you don't have to have any. I'll

10:15.685 --> 10:21.273
have my master sergeant

10:15.685 --> 10:21.273
picks up the papers. He'll bring them over. You 
sign your name. He says, pretty soon you'll be a

10:25.119 --> 10:28.223
second lieutenant of the reserve corps. I said, 
well, there's a hell of a lot of drill that I have

10:29.485 --> 10:40.456
forgotten and the drills in the Navy, even in 
parades, is different from the Army. I said, if I'm

10:41.357 --> 10:47.623
going to be able to service, I'd rather have the 
Navy end of it. Well, no, we don't have any Navy

10:47.683 --> 10:54.990
courses or naval officers here. I said, well, We 
had a discussion over it, but I wound up accepting

10:59.540 --> 11:06.668
the commission and put on the uniform with the rest 
of them. Now, did you have to go to meetings? Go to

11:10.031 --> 11:10.832
meetings? Go to meetings of other second 
lieutenants? No. Did they send you to any kind of a

11:16.338 --> 11:19.521
reserve training program? Hell no. And was that 
easy to get into the reserves in the 1920s? Well, if

11:24.767 --> 11:29.412
you've got the endorsement of a... professor of 
military science and tactics. I told him, I says, I

11:33.728 --> 11:51.035
don't know a damn thing about, I says, I know the 
commands for breaking from just what I know from

11:33.728 --> 11:51.035
the learned here or have or am learning. I had 
learned from reading the manual of arms infantry

11:57.016 --> 12:09.428
drill regulations, I knew how to give the commands 
to go from a column of squads to a skirmish line. The

12:11.089 --> 12:16.034
command is skirmishers blah blah blah blah. And I 
knew, all I knew was what I had learned there as a

12:16.054 --> 12:23.361
tactical officer. During the 1920s and the 1930s, 
when America was at peace, you remained the whole

12:23.932 --> 12:33.467
time in the Army Reserve. Is that not right? Well, 
let's see. You were still a reserve commissioned

12:36.732 --> 12:39.156
officer.

12:42.902 --> 12:47.709
Let me get the book, and I'll give you the exact 
date. Okay, let's continue. I entered

12:50.611 --> 13:18.660
the U.S. Navy January 18,

13:28.023 --> 13:44.715
I entered the U.S. Navy

13:28.023 --> 13:44.715
as a seaman,

13:28.023 --> 13:44.715
January 18, 19.

14:02.110 --> 14:10.638
or January 18, 1918, it would have to be.

14:10.658 --> 14:27.375
U.S. then, 18 January, and I was discharged

14:10.658 --> 14:27.375
18th of July, 1919.

14:31.152 --> 14:37.420
That would be about 20 some odd months, just short 
of two years. Then I became a private of field

14:38.922 --> 14:45.110
artillery, 7th of January, 1930. I became

14:45.130 --> 14:58.628
a private field artillery, 7th of January, 1930. 
And I served in that grade to...

15:14.431 --> 15:24.008
I became a private the 7th of January, and I vacated 
that status the 20th.

15:35.564 --> 15:45.715
that the 30th

15:35.564 --> 15:45.715
of January to the 10th of January 1930. Now the 
reason for that is a

15:45.735 --> 16:04.474
man to be promoted in the National Guard had to be in 
the National Guard at the time he was promoted. So I

16:05.990 --> 16:20.330
had graciously accepted the job as captain of the 
field artillery battery in River Falls,

16:05.990 --> 16:20.330
Wisconsin on that second date. Now you say, well, 
what kind of, how did you bridge the gap between

16:22.032 --> 16:25.998
that? Well, I went from, I

16:27.660 --> 16:33.128
went from, uh,

16:37.867 --> 16:42.252
the Military Academy at Gulfport, Mississippi. I 
accepted a job in the New Mexico School of Mines

16:43.314 --> 16:52.365
purely for the simple reason that it was a 
degree-granting institution. I asked no further

16:54.067 --> 16:56.290
questions. Actually, my remuneration in terms of 
room and board, laundry and food and everything,

17:07.617 --> 17:21.632
But my remuneration at Gulf Coast Military 
Academy was more than the $2,000 a year that was

17:07.617 --> 17:21.632
offered me as an instructor or assistant 
professor at New Mexico School of Mines. But I had

17:23.334 --> 17:37.590
told the teacher's agency in Chicago that got the 
job for me, that

17:23.334 --> 17:37.590
not to bother me until there was a job open in a 
college or a university. And so this one was the

17:38.971 --> 17:46.542
first that they found for me and made a sale on me, 
sight unseen. And so I'd accepted it. Now I got out

17:53.432 --> 18:08.573
to New Mexico School of Mines and I was there about 
three months when they were organizing,

17:53.432 --> 18:08.573
reorganizing and expanding the National Guard of 
New Mexico. Well the president of the School of

18:10.223 --> 18:31.388
Mines was a nice fellow and he was naturally wanted 
if there were any vacancies or anybody any sugar

18:10.223 --> 18:31.388
gonna fall out of this organizing this 
engineering company at Socorro.

18:33.731 --> 18:40.078
Why he wanted it to be open to any of the boys at the 
School of Mines. In fact, he wanted somebody on the

18:43.226 --> 18:58.603
faculty to kind of front and center and get an oar in 
that deal.

19:02.207 --> 19:10.116
So, I was not an engineer,

19:02.207 --> 19:10.116
but And I hadn't been to any camp or anything as a 
reserve officer, but I was still tagged with the

19:11.092 --> 19:21.727
state and lieutenant's title. So, well,

19:21.747 --> 19:34.484
I saw that none of the other guys were going to front 
and center and say they'd do it, and I had a

19:21.747 --> 19:34.484
disgracefully easy job out there. My teaching 
load

19:35.746 --> 19:40.693
wasn't... really, really respectable

19:41.703 --> 19:53.400
amount of service for the salary I was getting.

19:54.161 --> 20:02.593
Although it was, seems to be now, actually in those 
days two thousand dollars as a guy with had no more

19:54.161 --> 20:02.593
than an A.B. degree

20:02.653 --> 20:08.622
and one year, two years of teaching experience 
$2,000 a year was a hell of a good salary. What was

20:13.321 --> 20:14.482
the teaching load? Practically nothing. I had...

20:24.210 --> 20:29.075
I was assistant professor of English and 
economics. And

20:31.217 --> 20:38.423
everything else needed a slide rule. although 
sometimes you use the slide rule in economics.

20:48.030 --> 20:53.838
Everybody else on the faculty went around with 
these slide rules sticking out of their pocket. I

20:53.858 --> 20:56.822
was the only guy on the faculty that didn't have a 
slide rule. My courses were three

20:57.783 --> 21:09.439
hours a week for a freshman a section of freshmen 
and sophomores.

21:19.602 --> 21:26.792
It was three hours a week of teaching

21:19.602 --> 21:26.792
really freshman English. And bear in mind, some of 
the students in those colleges were people, were

21:37.972 --> 22:04.179
men 36 years old that had become a mine boss or a mine 
captain and they knew and knew the game and could

21:37.972 --> 22:04.179
run the mine better than the

21:37.972 --> 22:04.179
mining school graduate that was superintendent 
of the mine. Whereas the superintendent of the

22:05.441 --> 22:07.843
mine was getting at least eight or to nine thousand 
a year and this guy was getting what you would

22:08.768 --> 22:35.907
consider more or less straw boss a wage and those 
guys are the kind of guys that say well i'm going to

22:08.768 --> 22:35.907
the mining school get a degree and qualify for 
something better so in that in the class that i had

22:08.768 --> 22:35.907
of about of 15 students in each section.

22:44.805 --> 22:48.491
I had three hours a week with two sections. In other 
words, six hours at the podium. And students in

22:54.701 --> 23:02.333
front of me, some of them shade younger than I am, 
most of them, vastly older than I in both

23:03.190 --> 23:08.799
education, mining education and experience. But 
my job was to teach them the rudiments of grammar.

23:15.209 --> 23:18.014
That's where I learned that I had to start there. 
You can't teach English without the terminology.

23:24.504 --> 23:28.050
So you've got to teach them the terminology of what 
you're talking about. And you also at this time

23:29.515 --> 23:35.582
became involved with the National Guard in New 
Mexico. Yeah. And you were given, you were made a

23:37.864 --> 23:40.107
captain. Well, no. No, I didn't get past second 
lieutenant. Okay, so you were a second

23:46.173 --> 23:48.516
lieutenant. I'm a second lieutenant and I didn't 
stay with them long enough to go to the summer

23:48.536 --> 23:57.686
training camp. I went out and helped to organize 
the company. They had two platoons. One was a

24:04.466 --> 24:08.012
platoon of Mexicans where they called the role in 
Spanish. The other platoon were students and

24:09.835 --> 24:18.810
hired our clerks and whatnot around over town. 
They thought it might be a two weeks vacation in the

24:19.971 --> 24:24.058
summer.

24:28.156 --> 24:37.248
So I organized the downtown and the students. I got 
quite a few students into it.

24:44.497 --> 24:50.184
So there was one platoon that spoke English, the 
other platoon that spoke Spanish. Their role was

24:51.006 --> 24:52.948
called Spanish All of the ranks and ratings of the 
engineer company, of course, went to the white

24:53.958 --> 25:15.552
engineering students and men around town that 
were engineers or knew something about mining.

25:16.634 --> 25:21.602
Well, one of them was a bank clerk, and the other one 
of the telephone company. The captain of the

25:25.383 --> 25:28.767
company was the manager of the telephone company. 
Then they had a bonafide engineer graduate from

25:29.788 --> 25:36.376
the Virginia Military Institute, he was the first 
lieutenant. And my qualifications as second

25:37.877 --> 25:50.391
lieutenant of engineers was that when the, and by 
the way the first sergeant was a Mexican. and a darn

25:51.620 --> 25:55.406
bright one and a darn good one. But my principal 
duty was that I knew enough Spanish to know when he

25:55.426 --> 26:04.780
was calling the roll correctly.

26:06.983 --> 26:10.348
That was the warning I had from the captain. Your 
job is to keep your eyes and ears open on this. So you

26:15.376 --> 26:17.419
never went out on maneuvers with him? Hell no. I 
went to I got a leave of absence to miss the

26:21.742 --> 26:30.558
maneuvers, and I've forgotten where the 
maneuvers were. I think it was up around the camp at

26:30.618 --> 26:38.653
Las Vegas, New Mexico, not to be confused with not 
to be confused with Las Vegas, Nebraska, Nevada.

26:43.881 --> 26:48.505
And so you went, you got a leave of absence to go to 
the University of Colorado to get a master's.

26:48.525 --> 26:52.089
That's right, so I did a master's. I worked that 
summer and

26:52.289 --> 27:03.841
I kind of knocked a home run with the head of the 
history department up there. No, he wasn't headed

27:03.921 --> 27:05.122
in. He headed in a long time afterward. A fella 
named Goody Koontz. Old Goody Koontz was one of my

27:12.048 --> 27:16.795
history profs at the graduate level. And so,

27:18.617 --> 27:38.205
Goody Koontz was kind of concentrating on trying 
to get a grip on what you'd call mining history in

27:18.617 --> 27:38.205
the West. He was a Western. He was a disciple of the

27:41.641 --> 28:03.754
Ternarian theory of

27:41.641 --> 28:03.754
frontier history and he was out trying to learn all 
he could about mining districts. as a social

28:04.780 --> 28:14.816
aspect of the mining frontier, or civilizing 
influence, or uncivilizing, nobody knew which.

28:16.819 --> 28:21.407
And Goody Coons was trying to nail down a few things 
on that. And at the end of, I wrote a pretty good

28:22.869 --> 28:30.822
paper for him, I've forgotten what it was, and I 
could write fast and didn't mind writing. I typed

28:37.399 --> 28:42.285
pretty well and so I did a pretty good paper for him. 
He asked me to stay and he said, you're teaching in

28:43.527 --> 28:51.477
the mining school, aren't you? Had I looked into 
the nature of the mining districts in New Mexico,

28:58.865 --> 29:03.250
What was the legal and social, legal excuse for 
them? Were they governmental units of record? By

29:09.757 --> 29:13.802
what authority did they lynch people, if they 
lynched any? And it's a social aspect of the

29:15.344 --> 29:21.090
frontier and so forth. You looked into that? No, I 
didn't know anything about it.

29:28.970 --> 29:40.226
He said, well, you've read my

29:28.970 --> 29:40.226
study on the subject of the mining districts of 
Gilpin County, Colorado, haven't you? I said,

29:40.246 --> 29:49.880
well, actually, I should have read the writings of 
one of my professors, but I missed you.

29:53.845 --> 29:54.486
I hadn't read it. He said, well, you've been a bit 
deaf. and he says, when are you gonna come back to

29:56.695 --> 30:00.500
finish your master's degree? I says, I'm coming 
back next summer to work on it. He says, well, I'll

30:05.546 --> 30:06.768
tell you.

30:10.072 --> 30:23.749
He says, if you get interested in it when you get 
back, see what you can do with the mining districts

30:10.072 --> 30:23.749
of some area, logical area, of New Mexico. I said, 
well I've rattled around down there enough to know

30:25.585 --> 30:31.511
where the logical district is. I said the logical 
district is a southeast corner, the southeast

30:32.812 --> 30:40.359
quarter of the state. I says there isn't much up 
toward Colorado because Colorado was already

30:41.741 --> 30:54.613
being mined from the north, the big strikes up in

30:58.576 --> 31:02.080
Well, Gilpin County is one of them. I says, the 
mining history of New Mexico practically ends

31:02.100 --> 31:16.836
with what's being done now and what was done. I 
said, he says, well, he says, you're ready to get

31:18.457 --> 31:22.001
started already. He says, you do me a good master's 
thesis a good master's thesis.

31:34.027 --> 31:44.520
Doesn't have to be worthy of publication as is, but 
he says something that you can authenticate. Says

31:44.580 --> 31:57.456
if you can pull something together, he says you can 
get enough credits on a high quality MA thesis.

31:58.668 --> 32:05.598
that you won't need but one more summer to get the, 
complete the master's. But you'll have to come

32:06.118 --> 32:18.996
back here and complete the master's, whatever is 
left, and take the master's final examination,

32:06.118 --> 32:18.996
which is a poor imitation of the Ph.D. examination 
and so forth. And yes, you have to have one to get the

32:20.618 --> 32:28.489
master's from our college, now you have to have a 
reading knowledge of one foreign language. Says,

32:32.605 --> 32:36.509
I take it that you know enough Spanish for that. I 
says, yeah, I know Spanish as well as I do English

32:36.609 --> 32:43.297
when it comes to grammar and reading it. I can't, 
I'm not as articulate as I ought to be in oral

32:44.618 --> 32:54.830
Spanish, but yeah, I can handle anything that's in 
writing down there. So you did this master's

32:54.850 --> 32:57.733
thesis then? in my spare time at the college, of 
which I was overloaded with. I had more spare time

33:04.553 --> 33:07.397
than I had teaching. Well, why did you decide to go 
on for a PhD then? Well, I did after a fashion go on

33:14.966 --> 33:20.793
for a PhD, but not from there. I didn't want a PhD 
from Colorado. It was

33:28.544 --> 33:39.294
I

33:28.544 --> 33:39.294
formed a queer idea about PhDs in those days.

33:42.517 --> 33:55.429
If a guy got a PhD highway, if a guy got an AB Missouri

33:42.517 --> 33:55.429
PhD, Missouri, M.A. Missouri, Ph.D. Missouri. 
Well, I just figured the guy didn't really have a

34:01.796 --> 34:07.665
Ph.D. He just dug in enough with one or two 
departments to get one, and they didn't have any

34:07.685 --> 34:16.157
horizon. Now, I got that theory largely from this 
fellow Goody Coons. He told me, he says, with a

34:27.050 --> 34:48.939
master's says, hell that's pretty good for high 
school work, and gets you a job anywhere in a good

34:27.050 --> 34:48.939
high school, and lower jobs than the level of 
scholarship in universities. He says if you're

34:48.959 --> 34:55.167
going to be a school teacher, you've got to be a 
university school teacher. and you've got to get

34:56.513 --> 35:04.325
the requirements, meet the requirements. He 
says, I'm sure that you can do a thesis on what we're

35:04.565 --> 35:17.805
talking about, and it would get by as a PhD thesis in 
some places. But he says...

35:23.463 --> 35:31.375
I recommend that you get your PhD from, get all your 
graduate degrees from a different university.

35:32.858 --> 35:35.442
Why'd you decide on Minnesota? Well, I 
transferred there from Chicago for a

35:35.462 --> 35:43.495
geographical reason.

35:46.199 --> 35:49.504
I was in Chicago and I had retired One of my language 
requirements, I had mastered reading French

35:50.800 --> 35:58.292
exceptionally well. I was already pretty 
well-oiled in Spanish, and so I boned up reading.

36:09.490 --> 36:17.483
Of course, you don't have to be an expert reader, 
except in your field. Now, the vocabulary that you

36:18.762 --> 36:48.178
run into in reading one of Mary May's novelettes, 
or something by,

36:18.762 --> 36:48.178
by any of the French authors, real big names, de 
Maupassant, there's so much vernacular in there

36:18.762 --> 36:48.178
that,

36:49.373 --> 37:10.703
You have to be pretty good on reading French to read 
it in French, but when you get to history, the

36:49.373 --> 37:10.703
vernacular that you come into, break into in 
history, hell you can read, you can read French

36:49.373 --> 37:10.703
without knowing a hell of a lot of French. Because 
so many of their political terms and their

37:11.424 --> 37:18.334
military terms and their newspaper terms are 
right there in front of you. I had no trouble with

37:27.053 --> 37:29.595
French. However, today, if those two 
requirements were still required in a PhD today,

37:31.457 --> 37:44.670
we'd have better PhDs than we're getting. The 
modern PhDs are getting away with murder compared

37:49.550 --> 37:57.765
to what they would have had to do back in the 30s and 
early 40s. I know that sounds like a braggadocio

37:58.947 --> 38:09.246
statement, but I've seen PhD theses today that I 
wouldn't give a goddamn thing higher than a C+.

38:17.775 --> 38:39.621
You just go down to the Ph.D. files of some of these 
colleges that are offering them, and most of the

38:17.775 --> 38:39.621
O-line colleges like,

38:17.775 --> 38:39.621
well, University of Wisconsin, they'll admit to 
you without blushing that they're not requiring

38:40.816 --> 38:56.721
the PhDs that they did before the war years or even 
shortly after the war. Says the competition, the

38:56.741 --> 39:09.000
demand for PhDs to hold university teaching jobs 
in these universities created the demand. Well,

39:12.156 --> 39:29.578
unfortunately, the people that are suffering 
from the demand also have the powers to meet the

39:12.156 --> 39:29.578
problem by easing up on the production and then 
producing more and more. So that's the reason, if

39:30.939 --> 39:37.047
you really want to cry over the deterioration, of 
these famous departments for this and that field,

39:37.955 --> 39:56.611
says if you want to shed any tears over that, that's 
where you shed them, is when enrollments jump from

39:37.955 --> 39:56.611
10,000 to 45,000.

40:00.855 --> 40:07.320
It's inevitable that the professors will begin 
saying who among my mediocre crop of teaching

40:08.026 --> 40:24.463
assistants, and of course teaching assistants 
has itself watered down the quality of the

40:08.026 --> 40:24.463
academicians, academics.

40:27.286 --> 40:36.396
So we had to produce more PhDs to meet our growing 
needs, and if a man stays on the in a job as a PhD, as a

40:37.625 --> 41:06.265
graduate student in Wisconsin, if he stays there 
seven years as a teaching assistant, I think the

40:37.625 --> 41:06.265
word now is TAs, as a TA in Wisconsin, if he stays 
there seven years, hell, he has tenure. under the

41:06.835 --> 41:07.616
law. So the profs down there, I know the problem 
they were up against. I saw them in action

41:14.682 --> 41:27.273
while I was chief of staff for this, these 
technicians for these three combined boards. And

41:29.495 --> 41:36.741
they weren't talking about who

41:29.495 --> 41:36.741
is best qualified to be the next PhD to be Captain 
Gound, but how can we get good teaching assistants

41:37.582 --> 41:50.358
and then pick the best of the teaching assistants? 
Well, when you begin basing your need upon the

41:50.378 --> 42:05.918
teaching skill and subordinating the academic 
skill, you see, that is a very dangerous switch in

41:50.378 --> 42:05.918
the ultimate objective of what the Ph.D. used to 
be. How'd you get an offer to be a college president

42:12.276 --> 42:16.823
while you were still in your thirties? Well, 
because I was offered a job at the University of

42:17.785 --> 42:24.395
Minnesota, to make a long story short.

42:25.698 --> 42:26.599
I thought to hell. At

42:28.402 --> 42:32.749
River Falls, You offered a job at the University of 
Minnesota? Yeah, I was a full professor. When you

42:37.584 --> 42:39.005
got your PhD there? Yeah. And instead you decided 
to become the president of the University of

42:41.047 --> 42:47.893
Wisconsin at Superior? Yeah, which may or may not 
have been a good decision.

42:54.359 --> 42:58.543
You were a young man at that time, 34 years old or so. 
That's right. As a college president. Yeah. I was

43:02.986 --> 43:13.159
the youngest in the state and they were shouting 
about young university and college presidents.

43:13.179 --> 43:24.693
They just brought in this

43:13.179 --> 43:24.693
dreamer that was from the law school at Yale. What 
was his name? He was there president of the

43:29.125 --> 43:32.828
University of Chicago.

43:37.292 --> 43:44.018
He's been out in Southern California living out 
there, retired.

43:46.461 --> 43:48.983
I haven't seen or heard much of him lately. I know 
there was a very young man that came out of Oxford

44:00.074 --> 44:04.280
that was president of the University of Rochester 
about that time. There was a wave on saying we've

44:05.241 --> 44:09.106
got to go out and get younger blood. Well the 
Rochester guy lasted about two years and

44:10.187 --> 44:23.425
vanished, but the guy that came to University of 
Chicago stayed there a long time.

44:26.348 --> 44:27.550
And you stayed You stayed there at Superior until 
1940. Yeah. When you were October

44:33.357 --> 44:39.824
of 1940, you were activated.

44:42.847 --> 44:47.752
You were granted a leave of absence for military 
active duty on October 15, 1940. That's about

44:47.872 --> 44:50.074
right. And you went into the Army at what rank? Now, 
were you captain then? No, I was colonel. Oh, they

44:58.124 --> 45:00.568
gave you, they made you a colonel. Well, hell, I had 
worked hard enough to get it. Were you a full

45:07.501 --> 45:09.565
colonel or a lieutenant colonel? Oh, I was a full 
colonel. Even though you did not participate,

45:13.011 --> 45:20.925
this whole time you did not participate, during 
the 30's then you didn't participate in Any

45:21.547 --> 45:25.411
military drills or summer drills? To hell I 
didn't. Oh, well tell me about that then. Well,

45:30.055 --> 45:42.967
I was promoted from a private in the battery at 
River Falls. I was promoted from private to

45:44.128 --> 45:49.933
captain for the simple reason that the captain was 
a lawyer, and a bright, sharp lawyer named Kenneth

45:50.791 --> 45:58.121
White. Well, Kenneth White
