WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:11.073
Right on the truck, you know, back and forth from 
the stable hauling the hay and what not. That was, I

00:12.676 --> 00:14.460
enjoyed that. But those Army people took care of 
it. At that time, and the artillery, they had the

00:20.416 --> 00:28.701
caissons, I think it was, or two-wheel things, and 
the horses would pull that. And that was quite an

00:29.082 --> 00:33.936
occasion, because all that was done out on the 
drill field. for review or whatnot. But those Army

00:37.274 --> 00:51.427
people took care of the horses, and I suppose I

00:37.274 --> 00:51.427
remember how they used to saddle-soap the saddles 
and do that sort of work. Describe the student body

00:52.668 --> 00:55.230
generally. Where did they come from? What kind of 
families? What were their attitudes? What were

01:00.275 --> 01:02.657
Aggies like in the 30s? Well, these were all, you 
might say, pretty well just country boys, of

01:04.814 --> 01:12.966
course. They weren't over what? I don't remember 
the exact figures. They weren't over two or three

01:17.152 --> 01:19.316
thousand, were they? At that time, it might have 
been five or two or three thousand.

01:26.927 --> 01:30.973
You got to where you knew everybody.

01:32.911 --> 01:36.815
First name and last name, of course. Kind of knew 
where they were from. You know in these bull

01:40.560 --> 01:43.583
sessions where you'd sit there and talk to each 
other.

01:46.406 --> 01:47.548
I've forgotten a lot of it. Were they liberal, 
conservative? What was their attitude about hard

01:54.155 --> 01:55.857
work? About hard work? Well, I think everyone 
liked appreciated it. They

02:06.388 --> 02:18.967
appreciated everything that we had and

02:06.388 --> 02:18.967
were thankful of it. I know some of these boys that 
came down, particularly in the project houses,

02:20.510 --> 02:32.027
they were just thankful that they could go to 
college and be able to afford it.

02:38.165 --> 02:43.971
And were most of them from the country in small 
towns or were there a lot of city boys from Houston

02:38.165 --> 02:43.971
and Dallas? I would say at that time I thought they 
were mostly from out in the small towns. The 4-H at

02:50.537 --> 03:00.647
that time, or extension service, we got a lot of our 
people that came, at that time they had a A group

03:02.905 --> 03:31.090
that came in once a year, I can't remember exactly, 
Extension Service of the 4-H, and I suppose at that

03:02.905 --> 03:31.090
time, I don't know how many thousand kids and their 
teachers would come to A&M, and they had a big tent

03:02.905 --> 03:31.090
for soda water and whatnot out on the drill field, 
and they stayed in the dormitories. And they

03:31.306 --> 03:34.369
brought in every kid that wanted to come. Later 
years, as I understand, they started restricting

03:35.891 --> 03:42.958
it to winners or certain ones. But at that time, 
every kid that wanted to come down there got to

03:42.978 --> 03:47.763
come. And they would come by every means from every 
little small town in Texas. And I remember when I

03:56.893 --> 03:59.035
was going to school, I went around and I wasn't 
supposed to. College still had restrictions, but

04:03.070 --> 04:14.788
when I was going to grade school, I got some 
postcards from a place in Brown, and I sold those

04:03.070 --> 04:14.788
postcards on the campus. They were postcards of 
A&M and things like that, and I believe I made as

04:15.309 --> 04:24.904
much as $25 or $30 in a day. I really, that really 
helped me. Those kids bought those postcards, and

04:29.391 --> 04:35.820
I even was able to get them some stamps along once in 
a while. And I, this place in Bryan called

04:35.840 --> 04:48.857
Haswell's, up in, they had little postcards, I 
don't know how many years, and I almost got them

04:35.840 --> 04:48.857
all. Where did those kids stay on the campus? Where 
did they sleep? They stayed in the dormitory. And

04:56.524 --> 05:03.793
it seemed like to me some of them might have stayed 
in tents or something. I don't know. Oh, there must

05:04.954 --> 05:11.843
have been at that time maybe 10,000 or 12,000, best 
I remember. They really went all out for it. Did

05:14.807 --> 05:16.449
they use DeWare Fieldhouse? Did they sleep there?

05:22.196 --> 05:23.157
I just don't remember. I don't remember that. All 
right, back to the student body. Do you remember a

05:27.343 --> 05:40.809
variety of students, German, Italian, Mexican, 
in terms of their ancestry? Were there some

05:40.829 --> 05:43.795
German-American boys? If they were, I didn't 
realize it. Well, I'm talking about, say, from

05:46.075 --> 05:47.536
Brenham. Like the kids from Brenham, were there 
some Czech and German? We weren't conscious of

05:56.325 --> 05:59.147
that at the time. All right. As a matter of fact, way 
back there, you might have this hard to believe,

06:01.109 --> 06:12.280
when I lived across from my grandfather and going 
to grade school, I didn't realize the blacks were

06:14.555 --> 06:17.239
going to another school. It didn't enter my mind. I 
played with them after, in the cotton field after I

06:20.684 --> 06:26.794
got out of class, stuff like that. But it didn't 
enter my mind that they were going to another

06:27.434 --> 06:29.978
school. And there was a black elementary school in 
College Station then, I presume.

06:38.491 --> 06:40.334
I don't know where it was. I don't know. Where you 
said out in the cotton field, where was that? Well,

06:45.570 --> 06:48.134
that's back where the campus theater was. Oh, 
okay. That's where the campus theater is now. That

06:51.580 --> 06:53.803
was plowed ground? There was some fields there? 
There was a cotton pasture there, and part of a pen

06:55.466 --> 07:01.696
there that my grandfather kept cattle. He had been 
on the board of directors at A&M, and he sold cattle

07:02.798 --> 07:08.727
to the mess hall at A&M. Also, our water, we had a 
little problem with getting water from A&M. At one

07:16.527 --> 07:19.652
time, they didn't want to give us water over there. 
Of course, my grandfather had a well in the back of

07:21.916 --> 07:32.993
the house, and then I suppose they got other water 
at A&M.

07:34.525 --> 07:37.549
Later, I think we got some water coming from A&M. 
And what was his name, your grandfather? W.C.

07:40.033 --> 07:43.378
Boyette.

07:43.398 --> 07:47.584
He was on the board of directors at Texas A&M, as I 
understand, one time. And they also had that store

07:47.644 --> 07:52.551
at the North Gate that he operated. When did your 
grandfather come to Brazos County? Do you know?

07:57.939 --> 07:59.742
No. Did he grow up? No, I don't really. My mother was 
born there. My mother went to Villa Maria Academy.

08:10.941 --> 08:17.388
Matter of fact, I've got a picture in there that 
shows her on the basketball team.

08:17.408 --> 08:22.474
Somehow or another, my mother lived at College 
Station, but she went to Villa Maria. Because that

08:22.634 --> 08:25.517
was out east edge of Bryan, wasn't it? Yeah. I don't 
know how she got there. By buggy, I suppose. You

08:30.263 --> 08:32.386
mentioned the Interurban. When did it quit 
running, do you know? Was it operating when you

08:35.892 --> 08:40.379
were an A&M student? I'm quite sure it was, because 
I remember we went to, the student was, I was still

08:42.042 --> 08:57.486
going to Bryan once in a while to the picture show, 
and it came down right in front of where the campus

08:58.293 --> 09:11.225
theater is, and I believe that's where they had a 
house where they sold tickets or whatnot, and that

08:58.293 --> 09:11.225
was close to what's called a bachelor's hall. 
There used to be a bachelor's hall at A&M.

09:19.573 --> 09:22.436
But bachelor's hall, they served meals in there 
and everything. I think that was kind of

09:25.951 --> 09:31.638
professors that were not married that still 
wanted, could live on the campus. Most of all of

09:31.778 --> 09:42.452
those that lived on the campus were professors or 
workers at A&M like the power plant, plumbers,

09:31.778 --> 09:42.452
like they had a house also at A&M. Now the 
interurban, where did the tracks run between

09:43.533 --> 09:52.144
College Station and Bryan?

09:53.643 --> 10:05.937
The Interurban first started over here where the 
old Eagle office was, and I think I'd say it went

09:53.643 --> 10:05.937
down Texas Avenue and turned on... College? 
Turned on Cabot. Cabot. There used to be a big house

10:12.645 --> 10:15.088
up there, Cabot. It went on down, and you know how it 
crosses North Avenue, turns around through

10:20.069 --> 10:29.873
there, and then it, that's why that street cuts out 
through there. Then it went across, what is it,

10:30.214 --> 10:35.968
College Avenue, and circled all around There used 
to be a creek over there, I believe. And it turned,

10:41.237 --> 10:48.286
then turned to the left and came down to the, in 
front of the, where the campus theater is. And

10:49.508 --> 10:53.052
there was a building there and that's where it 
stopped. It didn't go, it stopped just at the edge

10:53.092 --> 10:56.597
of campus. It didn't go right on the edge on the 
campus. About how often did it run? Every hour?

11:01.884 --> 11:02.685
About every hour. And I think it was two of them. And 
they would alternate, and sometimes it was real

11:07.218 --> 11:20.083
difficult to get on there, particularly you came 
to Brown on the weekend and went to the picture

11:07.218 --> 11:20.083
show. Did any of your buddies have cars? Any of your 
student buddies? Not that I remember. We used to

11:31.636 --> 11:34.740
train all the time. They used to train to

11:35.161 --> 11:40.568
go anywhere. The train was the transportation. 
How often did you ride the train while you were a

11:44.713 --> 11:50.200
student? Well, I went to Dallas, I remember. I went 
to Louisiana that one time. I think it was Baton

11:57.951 --> 11:59.112
Rouge. I

12:00.948 --> 12:09.239
think for the Rice game I hitchhiked.

12:10.821 --> 12:11.862
I know I went to Dallas.

12:15.206 --> 12:16.948
There might have been one or two other trips. Oh, I 
went on the train to the Baylor game. I remember

12:22.015 --> 12:22.756
that. But the other trips I don't really remember. 
Do you remember some students who had to drop out

12:26.300 --> 12:30.786
because they didn't have the money? No, I really 
don't.

12:37.767 --> 12:44.555
Once you registered there, it seemed like, you 
know, they were like the project house boys. They

12:46.397 --> 12:56.930
required, at that time, when you registered at 
A&M, if you were on campus, you had to pay for the

12:46.397 --> 12:56.930
room and the board. The whole semester. So if you 
registered, you were for the semester. Now, the

13:01.664 --> 13:12.480
project house boys didn't have to pay that, of 
course, and they mainly ate food that was brought

13:01.664 --> 13:12.480
from their home county.

13:13.741 --> 13:18.168
Describe the variety of jobs that students had on 
campus. Y'all mowed the lawn and cleaned up the

13:19.109 --> 13:21.553
horse stables. What else? Well, I remember a lot of 
students were lucky enough to be waiters in the

13:23.095 --> 13:27.481
mess hall. O.D. Butler was one of them, and he 
learned a lot about

13:34.300 --> 13:35.922
things as a waiter. Did you know O.D. as a student? 
No, I didn't. Knew him later in the reserve.

13:46.738 --> 13:55.130
There weren't many other jobs that I could 
really...

13:46.738 --> 13:55.130
Did they do janitor work? Did they sweep floors?

13:59.176 --> 13:59.937
I believe they did. Well,

14:02.296 --> 14:08.444
I don't remember any cleaning crew that would have 
been there. What were the best student jobs?

14:14.531 --> 14:15.492
If you had your choice. The mess hall. Is that 
right? I think, for what I remember. Who ran the

14:19.918 --> 14:21.300
mess hall then? Who was in charge of the food 
service? Well, I believe it was a man named Duncan.

14:28.549 --> 14:32.033
And he had a daughter that also went to school at 
Consolidated. He was in charge of the mess hall,

14:33.565 --> 14:41.554
and he had a house that was there near the mess hall. 
They had a real two-story house, and that's where

14:41.574 --> 14:57.071
the board of directors stayed and where they did a 
little high-type

14:41.574 --> 14:57.071
entertaining, as I remember, there in his home. 
And the board of directors stayed there. Now, you

15:00.498 --> 15:03.624
did eat some on the campus, didn't you? Yes. 
Describe the food that was served in the dining

15:06.549 --> 15:09.074
halls.

15:13.442 --> 15:14.444
Well, it was very good.

15:18.612 --> 15:21.257
Maybe I ate there one term, I'm not sure. I didn't 
eat a whole lot at times at the mess hall.

15:29.508 --> 15:45.956
But you had to march in, of course, and sit down, 
take your hat off, and you had to know the names for

15:29.508 --> 15:45.956
everything on there or you didn't get it. What were 
some of those names?

15:51.325 --> 15:54.032
I can't remember now.

15:58.102 --> 16:03.175
But you had, everything had a certain name.

16:04.758 --> 16:06.159
And you had to know that. They didn't rush you. You 
were able to sit down and enjoy your meal. It wasn't

16:13.267 --> 16:17.271
like some of I've heard some places since then. It 
wasn't that way. You could, you could, but you did

16:19.553 --> 16:25.739
have to know and have, you had to act a certain way. 
And of course, you had a certain place to sit too.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.424
That was all really well organized. The only thing 
you could do is when you walked into the mess hall,

16:36.465 --> 16:44.276
as you got up to the steps, then you could start 
yelling and running. But then, when you got in

16:44.516 --> 16:50.985
there, then you, that was over. You acted 
correctly. Well, as you recall, what was your

16:55.852 --> 16:59.577
favorite dining hall food? What did you like best?

17:04.748 --> 17:06.129
I can't remember. I really can't. Was the food 
good? Oh, yes. Yes. Was there enough of it? Oh,

17:11.074 --> 17:11.274
yeah. Oh, yeah. Had plenty of it. It was very good. I 
remember when I was going to, one thing I can

17:14.036 --> 17:32.173
remember about the, mainly about the mess hall, 
was when I was delivering newspapers as, when I was

17:14.036 --> 17:32.173
going to the slaughter days, and I'd take several 
newspapers and go in the kitchen, and I could have

17:14.036 --> 17:32.173
some of the best Fried ham sandwiches.

17:38.045 --> 17:41.228
I remember that. Well, those days really, 
anything you had a lot of times, you appreciated

17:41.488 --> 17:53.078
because a lot of times you were hungry. And when you 
ate, a lot of times, we were hungry, and of course

17:54.039 --> 18:01.485
young people like that eat more anyway.

18:04.165 --> 18:05.928
My mother did real well. She ran a boarding house 
there off the campus. Several others did. A lot of

18:12.158 --> 18:13.400
ladies did. Now who ate in those boarding houses? 
Some professors and some students that were day

18:17.546 --> 18:26.581
students. They called them day students. And a lot 
of the army people. Those army people that were

18:32.799 --> 18:36.904
taking care of that, they ate in boarding houses. 
And some of the professors, some of the different

18:37.925 --> 18:41.710
ones off the campus. But I went through a lot of 
times there. My mother did real well at feeding me

18:45.374 --> 18:54.165
and everything, but way back there I went hungry 
several times. I appreciated, when I sit down and I

18:54.245 --> 18:58.270
appreciated I'd go to a friend's house. I was 
always welcome. At that time, you didn't have to

19:03.980 --> 19:05.602
call. As kids, you didn't have to call or anything 
like that. You'd go there, and if it was come time to

19:07.964 --> 19:18.354
eat, you'd sit down, and they might not have 
anything but maybe cornbread and a big bowl of stew

19:07.964 --> 19:18.354
or something. But you were always welcome. Now, 
you said your mother ran a boarding house where?

19:26.082 --> 19:28.324
Well, my grandfather had built three houses, I 
believe it was, right across from where he lived at

19:29.620 --> 19:37.051
where the campus theater is. We lived in the second 
one. And that's where the house was located.

19:44.643 --> 19:47.567
That's where the house was located that they stole 
that house from. And

19:47.828 --> 19:54.598
did some students live in these boarding houses? 
Did people live, rent a bedroom? Yes.

20:02.993 --> 20:08.824
The first house right across from my grandfather 
was right near what the old Stucco building is. My

20:09.479 --> 20:31.960
uncle built a kind of a rooming house there, and one 
or two of the, I think, of the single professors had

20:09.479 --> 20:31.960
rooms there, and then he

20:09.479 --> 20:31.960
rented some rooms to people that maybe worked on 
the campus, maybe at the exchange store, stuff

20:09.479 --> 20:31.960
like that. And then there was another house down 
below there that's gone now, a two-story house,

20:31.940 --> 20:39.709
and she ran a boarding house there. She had a few 
rooms there. There was no hotel or anything like

20:44.094 --> 20:46.858
that around. Was Lupo yet in business at the 
Northgate? No, I think Lupo was going to school

20:51.243 --> 20:53.505
when I was. Okay. He might have been... handling 
books at the time. I bought my books secondhand. He

21:05.021 --> 21:12.128
may have had some little place where he was selling 
books. I had to buy a lot of them at the exchange

21:13.069 --> 21:19.735
store, I remember, and they were always higher. 
And it was over there on the north side of the campus

21:21.256 --> 21:27.782
back north of Sabeasa, the exchange store? 
Duncan.

21:34.052 --> 21:40.278
If you go around, I think it's, go on the campus from 
the north gate. Yes, sir. There was a house there

21:41.499 --> 21:58.174
Mitchell lived in, I believe, and then Duncan, 
around the mess hall, in the mess hall, and you go

21:41.499 --> 21:58.174
around there across Military Walk and on left with 
this grocery store on the right was the exchange

21:58.762 --> 22:02.209
store. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And they also had a 
telegraph station in there. Oh, I worked for them a

22:07.100 --> 22:15.598
little bit delivering some, delivering 
telegrams. They were upstairs. You worked while

22:16.740 --> 22:18.424
you were a student? Right. Later on, that was one 
reason I didn't do very good. I got a part-time job

22:23.818 --> 22:33.959
with the triple agriculture department at night, 
so that's one reason why I didn't do very well at the

22:23.818 --> 22:33.959
time. You mentioned Pinky Downs. Was he on the 
campus when you were a student? Not that I

22:40.477 --> 22:41.738
remember. I knew him later. That's what I thought. 
If the students were going out, was the rock pit,

22:45.683 --> 22:54.112
did they go swimming in the rock pits then when you 
were a student? It wasn't the fish tank I believe it

22:55.814 --> 22:58.457
was. Okay. For some of them fish. They didn't go out 
much like that. Did they go to the river sometime

23:02.862 --> 23:06.306
and have a quiet party? Not that I remember.

23:11.425 --> 23:14.630
Now, how did you guys get dates?

23:17.976 --> 23:30.177
Well, it seemed like at that time we didn't get 
dates like young people do at that age.

23:31.743 --> 23:32.765
Not like it is today. Did you take a date to the 
cotton ball or the ring dance? Do you remember

23:41.983 --> 23:42.744
that?

23:45.550 --> 23:47.794
No, I didn't at that time.

23:50.519 --> 23:52.603
I just didn't have the money as best I remember.

23:55.891 --> 23:59.575
Were there some famous visitors? Fellas didn't go 
in for dates at that age like they do now.

24:07.024 --> 24:10.929
That was an occasion for some of those girls from 
CIA to come down here. You had to buy her flowers, I

24:12.050 --> 24:15.554
suppose, and a few things like that.

24:20.320 --> 24:24.885
While you were a student, were there any famous 
visitors that came to the campus? that you

24:25.810 --> 24:26.611
remember?

24:29.375 --> 24:40.631
I think it was Roosevelt that came and rode the car 
around Kyle Field. I don't know whether I was at A&M

24:40.991 --> 24:44.176
then or not. I've forgotten. But best I remember, I 
was down there. It wasn't a real big occasion to me.

24:52.962 --> 24:57.888
We didn't know too much about politics then, 
didn't worry too much about it. All we had was

24:57.908 --> 25:02.012
radio.

25:02.032 --> 25:05.977
And do you remember what programs y'all enjoyed 
most on the radio? What did you listen to most? No, I

25:10.862 --> 25:14.907
didn't listen to too much.

25:17.710 --> 25:21.855
And you lived off campus all your student years? 
Yeah. I lived off campus all the time. Sometimes I

25:29.076 --> 25:32.159
lived in a house across from where the campus seat 
is. My grandfather died and then I moved over

25:32.480 --> 25:34.922
there. My mother also ran a boarding house there 
and we had some extra rooms there. But that's where

25:42.871 --> 25:49.058
I was living when I graduated from A&M. Do you 
remember going to Silver Taps as a student? No, I

25:56.415 --> 26:00.420
really don't, but if they had some, I'm sure I was 
there. Did you work on Bonfire? Did you help gather

26:03.164 --> 26:06.327
stuff for Bonfire?

26:08.830 --> 26:10.633
I don't remember, but I'm sure I did. That would 
have been part of, as I say, every activity, even

26:11.854 --> 26:18.522
though I was what they call a day student. every 
activity you had you you willingly you didn't have

26:20.375 --> 26:49.707
to but you you did now where was bonfire held on the 
drill field right on the drill field and what i

26:20.375 --> 26:49.707
think i i was here at the time but that boy got killed 
flying over and he dropped a can of gasoline on it oh

26:20.375 --> 26:49.707
describe that well as i remember some student from 
Texas University came over in a plane. And he

26:59.377 --> 27:04.567
dropped a can of gasoline, as I understand, I don't 
remember. And when he came down and he took off, and

27:06.350 --> 27:13.163
the rise of the plane ended turned over to the right 
somewhere around about hit the ground about where

27:14.729 --> 27:21.277
Olsen Field is and killed him. That's really all I 
can think of. Did he drop the can of gas? As I

27:27.065 --> 27:29.067
remember, he did. But it didn't? It didn't do any 
good. I don't know. At that time, also, for the

27:32.352 --> 27:40.442
bonfire, they put people around at the entrances 
to A&M. See, A&M There weren't very many

27:43.248 --> 27:45.572
entrances. Well, there's still not. North Gate, I 
don't remember whether one was up at the, there was

27:47.895 --> 27:58.412
one at the South Gate and one at the West Gate. I 
don't remember the one being at the East Gate where

27:58.892 --> 28:05.502
you could drive onto campus until later. But see 
the, more or less, West Gate where the railroad

28:07.045 --> 28:11.652
station was. And bonfire, what was put into the 
bonfire? What did they burn? Well, that was just

28:20.402 --> 28:28.512
sticks and crates and all things of that nature. 
And about how long did the students work to gather

28:29.233 --> 28:32.537
that stuff? I don't think they worked there as long 
as they do today. And how did that outhouse get

28:39.121 --> 28:45.549
stolen from your family? At night. It

28:48.173 --> 28:53.419
was right at the edge of the campus. And I don't know 
whether that's the one they put on top or not. They

29:00.088 --> 29:01.670
might have just used it for the wood. They went 
around, took these things from the railroad

29:02.371 --> 29:07.778
station, went all around as much as they could and 
gathered up, usually it was lumber and I reckon

29:09.158 --> 29:18.231
trees that had fell down or something like that. As

29:19.253 --> 29:31.190
I remember, we were not the only people that had 
their outhouse stolen.

29:31.210 --> 29:32.291
Didn't have to. We didn't object to it at all. But 
now I'm assuming that In those years, y'all didn't

29:38.335 --> 29:43.820
worry about something important being stolen. 
You didn't have to lock your car, your house. We

29:47.163 --> 29:49.145
didn't have any locks on our house at all. Might 
have been a lock put in there. I don't know whether

29:52.388 --> 29:53.789
it was or not. You didn't have to worry about 
anything on or off the campus, either one. There

30:01.877 --> 30:06.081
was not that problem. Do you remember going to 
final review and

30:07.985 --> 30:17.639
commencement? Describe those. Well, I remember 
going to the commencement just a little bit, but

30:20.964 --> 30:35.224
you see, at the time, I had to take military 
science, and even though up until the time I

30:20.964 --> 30:35.224
graduated, I had to wear a uniform. I didn't take 
ROTC the final two years because I had dropped out

30:36.622 --> 30:57.050
with a hernia, and to get what's called advanced 
contract, you had to have your grades up okay, and

30:36.622 --> 30:57.050
even if you had your grades up, to get the advanced 
contract was difficult.

30:59.614 --> 31:01.296
They didn't have that many openings. So, after 
marching around in the final review, I did it as a

31:03.031 --> 31:11.674
freshman and a sophomore.
