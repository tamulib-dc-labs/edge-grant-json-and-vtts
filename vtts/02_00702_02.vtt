WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:10.185
Since I was a student?

00:12.448 --> 00:26.848
Well,

00:12.448 --> 00:26.848
I guess the major change that I immediately sensed 
when I came back was the transition from an

00:12.448 --> 00:26.848
all-military school from a compulsory military 
to a non-compulsory military. When I was here in

00:33.085 --> 00:49.843
the 50s it was compulsory and everybody was in the 
Corps with the exception of some returning

00:33.085 --> 00:49.843
veterans who was coming back from World War II and 
still in the educational environment. But it was

00:49.863 --> 00:55.249
an all-military school, an all-male

00:49.863 --> 00:55.249
school. The emphasis, as I understood it then, and 
also as I seem to sense it when I came back in 69, was

00:56.613 --> 01:09.251
it was an undergraduate teaching institution. 
They may have had graduate programs at that time. I

01:12.476 --> 01:15.781
certainly don't recall in the 50s. And I do not 
recall any kind of major emphasis in the research

01:15.801 --> 01:21.709
area when I was a student. It seemed like the 
faculty were here to teach and did little else.

01:33.020 --> 01:44.472
The other thing is I recall at that time there was, 
it seemed to me anyway, a large percentage of the

01:33.020 --> 01:44.472
faculty were A&M graduates. That's not 
particularly bad. I make no value judgment on that

01:47.335 --> 01:51.719
one way or the other, but that seemed to be the 
situation. But I came back in 69. It was evident,

01:54.292 --> 01:59.818
and other than the physical facilities, a great 
change in the physical facilities of the

01:54.292 --> 01:59.818
university. There's no comparing that. The 
change the university went through when Dr.

02:02.321 --> 02:15.615
Williams was president in terms of remodeling the 
campus and trying to keep the campus up in terms of

02:02.321 --> 02:15.615
building, it was just a phenomenal change. 
There's no way to describe that. So there was a...

02:18.858 --> 02:22.442
Dr. Williams was the... was the president of the 
university after President Rudder, Jack

02:22.675 --> 02:29.605
Williams.

02:32.489 --> 02:33.591
He was an excellent president. I think one of the 
major contributions he made to this university

02:33.771 --> 02:48.253
was putting its campus in order, physically in 
order, in addition to the growth of the academic

02:33.771 --> 02:48.253
programs to make it truly a university. It was a 
college in 1950. was primarily agriculture and

02:51.633 --> 02:54.499
engineering. I'm sure that there were some other 
programs, but

02:56.744 --> 03:03.278
I was not aware of them. They just didn't have the 
emphasis. It was engineering and agriculture.

03:09.082 --> 03:25.729
Well, when

03:09.082 --> 03:25.729
I came in 69, I sensed a transition occurring then, 
that the idea was to have a faculty member that

03:09.082 --> 03:25.729
could be a researcher and a teacher. And it seemed 
like from that point on, in the early 70s and so

03:27.111 --> 03:33.942
forth, The idea was to try to employ people that 
could do research as well as teach.

03:43.131 --> 03:51.985
And as I began to move into administrative 
positions where I was more aware of what I

03:43.131 --> 03:51.985
considered to be the administration's policy, 
that was true. There was an emphasis being placed

03:52.005 --> 03:55.871
on research and teaching. And in the 50s, where you 
had a teaching faculty, that could probably do

04:02.221 --> 04:04.523
research, I guess. I don't know. Now we have a 
greater percentage of our faculty that are

04:05.324 --> 04:10.929
research faculty that can also teach. And in my 
opinion, I don't think we have degraded the

04:12.791 --> 04:19.557
teaching quality of our faculty. We've added a 
faculty that has an additional characteristic.

04:23.661 --> 04:31.148
Do you think that the emphasis on research may have 
gone too far at the expense of teaching quality? I

04:33.203 --> 04:45.109
think that the seeds have been planted that can 
take us too far. There's been a lot of criticism of

04:45.209 --> 04:52.765
these National Science Foundation research 
grants for some of the topics that have been

04:53.926 --> 05:01.315
seemingly impractical topics that have been 
researched, and this has led to a lot of opposition

04:53.926 --> 05:01.315
to this program in Congress. In fact, I believe the 
budget for the whole program was left out of, the

05:01.335 --> 05:10.988
money for the whole program was inadvertently 
left out of the budget and had to go back and be put

05:01.335 --> 05:10.988
in, but the funds haven't been cut on this. Because 
a lot of congressmen have been saying that some of

05:11.348 --> 05:17.156
these research projects don't have any real 
practical value. What's your idea on this? Well,

05:18.878 --> 05:22.903
that, historically... Is research, for the sake 
of research, desirable? Historically, the

05:23.626 --> 05:29.712
National Science Foundation has not funded 
engineering projects. This, of course, has been

05:29.792 --> 05:41.464
always a thorn in the side of the engineering 
community that we do not have a federal agency that

05:29.792 --> 05:41.464
looks into or supplies or funds engineering 
research per se. I don't know, 10 years ago or so, a

05:44.007 --> 05:53.076
small arm of the National Science Foundation was 
added to try to take care of engineering-related

05:44.007 --> 05:53.076
research. I think that in the types of projects 
you're mentioning, you won't find one of those

05:53.596 --> 06:06.164
being called out that was actually being funded by 
the Engineering Army. The Engineering Army has

06:06.184 --> 06:12.297
their emphasis more on funding programs to solve 
problems. Our emphasis here in the college, and I

06:16.293 --> 06:28.187
would suppose the university, is more applied as 
opposed to developing knowledge for knowledge

06:16.293 --> 06:28.187
sake. I know at least in the College of Engineering 
our programs are directed, research is directed

06:28.208 --> 06:35.837
at solving a particular problem or a set of 
problems.

06:41.624 --> 06:42.165
What are some of the challenges that an industrial 
engineer would expect in the 1980s. I was

06:45.642 --> 07:08.466
going to say before I say that another part of the 
growth has been in the research area and it's been

06:45.642 --> 07:08.466
undergirded and has been strengthened through 
the engineering experiment station. I don't know

07:08.486 --> 07:11.089
exactly when the engineering experiment station 
begin to move into an expanding role of research.

07:19.487 --> 07:25.094
It seemed like to me it must have occurred sometime 
in the 60s. But with the expanding role of the

07:25.114 --> 07:39.912
Engineering Experiment Station, the concept of 
research, as well as teaching at the college and

07:25.114 --> 07:39.912
university level, that became more into focus. 
Prior to the real growth and emphasis in research

07:40.921 --> 07:49.714
by the Engineering Experiment Station, we were a 
teaching institution. As the Experiment Station

07:49.734 --> 08:09.021
grew and matured and took its rightful role in 
serving the Texas community, which has to do with

07:49.734 --> 08:09.021
research, serving the Texas community in proper 
sense, then the idea of research in the College of

07:49.734 --> 08:09.021
Texas A&M began to establish its own position and 
take a rightful position in teaching. That

08:09.912 --> 08:13.379
occurred, it seems like to me, in the last 10 years. 
When I came in 69, I was aware of the Engineering

08:14.161 --> 08:25.103
Experiment Station, but its role was not as 
focused as it became in the next 10 years. to really

08:25.471 --> 08:32.343
try to meet the needs, technological needs of the 
industry and the people of the state of Texas. And

08:32.363 --> 08:39.856
when they saw that, when the administration and 
the leadership saw that, then research became a

08:32.363 --> 08:39.856
greater focus. And it took sort of a rightful 
position with teaching. Now, what was that

08:43.662 --> 08:45.624
question? What future challenges will 
industrial engineers expect to see in the 80s?

08:51.512 --> 08:55.637
Well, everything is going to cost more. And the 
industrial engineer will be asked to perform

08:55.657 --> 09:12.538
decision-making roles that will permit growth 
and production to occur in a more economical

08:55.657 --> 09:12.538
fashion so as to guarantee profits.

09:14.780 --> 09:19.066
In other words, updating plant equipment to make 
them more efficient. Right, and that's it. Now,

09:20.228 --> 09:42.340
the difficulty of that is that the technology is 
more complex, and the idea of saying I'm going to

09:20.228 --> 09:42.340
make a decision between the two types of lathes 25 
years ago is not like saying make a decision

09:20.228 --> 09:42.340
between two different types of robots or 
numerical control machinery. Because you talk

09:43.248 --> 09:48.755
about millions of dollars of investment per atom. 
So what the industrial engineer is going to have to

09:48.775 --> 09:59.370
do, he's going to have to improve his tools of what 
we call simulation. What we teach our students now

09:59.390 --> 10:06.800
is the ability to simulate complex processes. By 
that I mean to quantify, to quantitatively

10:08.282 --> 10:12.968
describe them. put that on a computer. If you can 
quantitatively describe your system and you know

10:16.875 --> 10:29.576
the variables that are going to relate to the 
operation of that system, then you can program it

10:16.875 --> 10:29.576
and change them by computer. And within seconds, 
you can see what, if you make this change, what the

10:30.317 --> 10:37.369
impact will be, or you make this change, what the 
impact will be. The challenge will be for our

10:38.075 --> 10:54.712
industrial engineers to be able to quantifiably 
simulate complex manufacturing systems so that

10:38.075 --> 10:54.712
they can help management make the correct 
decisions in planning for productivity and

10:38.075 --> 10:54.712
technology growth. If we're ever going to get back 
ahead in the productivity game, my feeling is the

10:55.112 --> 11:04.241
industrial engineers are going to get us there. 
That's the general feeling of the engineering

11:04.261 --> 11:07.204
community now. It's probably that particular 
item that industrial engineering will actually

11:07.606 --> 11:16.567
hang its hat on for the next decade, 25 years. 
Actually be that item that industrial

11:16.588 --> 11:22.662
engineering will effectively move into what we 
call the engineering community. You may not be

11:23.333 --> 11:29.639
aware of it, but industrial engineering is a 
fairly young engineering technology. Organized

11:29.659 --> 11:35.966
itself, as far as the society is concerned, is 
about as early as 1946. Industrial engineering,

11:35.986 --> 11:47.457
as such, is an all-new period of non-acceptance by 
the other engineers, whereas chemical engineers

11:35.986 --> 11:47.457
are mechanical engineers. Electrical engineers 
have been around years and years and years. Do we

11:50.961 --> 11:53.323
really need something called industrial 
engineering? industrial engineering has for the

11:53.843 --> 12:05.368
past 25 years or so been groping through the maze of 
technology trying to find that item. They hang

12:05.388 --> 12:11.802
their hats over and say, this is what industrial

12:05.388 --> 12:11.802
engineers do. I think the productivity issue is 
what you mean by that. Regarding this

12:17.447 --> 12:25.840
productivity issue, the way I understand it, it's 
said that the plants in the United States are not as

12:17.447 --> 12:25.840
cost-efficient as those in West Germany or Japan. 
Is that true? Yes. Of course, you say, why aren't

12:29.967 --> 12:31.329
they? There's a number of reasons why they're not. 
But the main reason is that they're outdated and

12:33.853 --> 12:38.581
outmoded. Since the Japanese... West German 
plants were built right after World War II. These

12:43.572 --> 12:47.019
others were built earlier. That's exactly right. 
The idea that our plants are outmoded and the idea

12:48.682 --> 12:55.073
that our plants are operating at the less than 
maximum efficiency. And that's the reason we're

12:55.093 --> 12:58.680
here. Most of the companies, to get these plants 
updated, this won't be a problem. Most of the

13:03.393 --> 13:13.682
companies are looking at, that we're aware of, are 
looking at a 10-year program of what they call

13:03.393 --> 13:13.682
re-industrialization. I

13:13.662 --> 13:30.576
think that the U.S. is going to go through a new 
industrial revolution that they experienced and

13:13.662 --> 13:30.576
the whole world experienced it so many years ago. 
And during this time, I think we'll be upgrading

13:30.596 --> 13:32.700
and modifying and modernizing our manufacturing 
systems. It's going to be very critical that

13:32.680 --> 13:40.949
during this process that the right decision is 
made. You don't want to buy machinery and put in,

13:40.969 --> 13:47.396
modernize your plant and make the wrong decision 
on what you buy. I think that's part of the

13:47.416 --> 13:54.263
inflation problem is the fact that our plants are 
not always up to date as they should be. It's a

13:54.283 --> 13:55.925
production problem. Things cost more because we 
don't produce as much. I sincerely believe that. I

14:02.689 --> 14:04.472
agree with Bill Grimm. Let me ask you one other 
thing I should have asked you earlier. When you

14:08.320 --> 14:12.749
came in 69, about how many students were there in 
industrial engineering? There were about 1,800 a

14:12.809 --> 14:13.871
day. How has this changed in these 12 years?

14:20.993 --> 14:24.199
I've been able to tell you how it's changed since I 
became a partner here. We had a little over 900

14:24.219 --> 14:30.390
students when I became a partner here. So it's 
doubled in six years. If I were to extrapolate back

14:32.173 --> 14:44.655
to 69 and recalling some of the

14:32.173 --> 14:44.655
things Brother told me, we must have been 
somewhere around So

14:45.968 --> 15:10.845
you've tripled in 12 years. Is there anything else 
that you'd like to say before we close? Anything

15:12.127 --> 15:13.149
that I didn't touch on that I should have? Well...

15:36.087 --> 16:02.110
You know, I was going to say, I'm going to sort of 
pass on this changes, in addition to physical

15:36.087 --> 16:02.110
changes, which is evident, and enrollment 
changes, which is less evident and yet evident

15:36.087 --> 16:02.110
to the person that's probably in there, is this 
research teaching emphasis. Another major

16:02.510 --> 16:05.993
change that's occurred seems to be that

16:08.960 --> 16:13.507
Texas A&M has been a growth in graduate education. 
Of course, this may be tied to the growth

16:13.527 --> 16:20.799
of research and kind of change, given the emphasis 
of research. But there's been a major change in

16:20.819 --> 16:27.850
terms of graduate education. A&M has always been a 
very strong undergraduate institution. And as

16:33.119 --> 16:35.322
such, it's made quite an impact but

16:36.078 --> 16:59.947
we have never made a major impact

16:36.078 --> 16:59.947
at other institutions

16:36.078 --> 16:59.947
of higher learning. We just don't have that many 
faculty, people who are on PhDs teaching

16:59.967 --> 17:01.589
elsewhere. One reason we would never have the 
graduate program. I think that we're gonna see in

17:03.171 --> 17:03.992
the next, 25 years certainly increase in the 
number of Texas A&M University PhDs teaching in

17:05.913 --> 17:23.803
other universities as such can't do anything but 
help us increase our image in the academic

17:05.913 --> 17:23.803
community the academic community unfortunately 
does not rate another university in terms of its

17:24.053 --> 17:32.743
undergraduate program per se. Those students go 
in the industry and make your reputation in the

17:33.144 --> 17:38.210
industry. Other academic institutions 
generally measure you in terms of your students

17:38.230 --> 17:47.901
that you put out and become faculty researchers 
and publish at other institutions. We're behind

17:47.881 --> 18:05.043
the power curve on that because we have not had the 
graduate programs.

18:05.063 --> 18:07.566
We're going to see that catching up shortly. Even 
though still a lot of our students, even our

18:07.586 --> 18:13.534
graduate students are going into the industry, 
there is an increasing percentage going into

18:07.586 --> 18:13.534
teaching now. And we're going to see the image of 
Texas A&M certainly increase in the academic

18:13.554 --> 18:15.616
community as a result. Is there anything else? No, 
I don't think so. I appreciate you taking the time

18:21.064 --> 18:25.055
to talk with us when it comes to health. Are you 
sure? It seems like I'm wandering around here.

18:28.444 --> 18:29.768
Thank you.
