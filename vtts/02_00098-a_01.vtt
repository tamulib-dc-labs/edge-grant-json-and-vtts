Friday, testing, testing, testing.

00:08.186 --> 00:12.992
Testing two, testing two, Friday two, Friday two, 
testing. Test it. Testing, testing, Friday the

00:15.796 --> 00:18.320
fourth. Testing, okay, testing.

00:22.826 --> 00:25.029
This is Friday, October 5th. We're in the MSC, and I 
have the honor of recording the memories of his A&M

00:28.617 --> 00:36.708
experiences with Mr. Michele Halbuty, class of 
1930. To introduce yourself, Mr. Halbuty, to

00:37.750 --> 00:49.406
anyone that might hear this tape or read a 
transcription, describe your family background

00:37.750 --> 00:49.406
growing up. When did mom and dad come to this 
country? Where did you all live? Where'd you go to

00:52.390 --> 00:53.331
high school? I went to high school in Beaumont, 
Texas. I was born in Beaumont, Texas on the 21st of

00:58.081 --> 01:02.926
June, 1909. In nine months, I'll be 73 years old. My 
parents came to the United States separately.

01:14.439 --> 01:17.322
They didn't know each other until they met each 
other in Beaumont, Texas. Were they both

01:18.543 --> 01:19.624
Lebanese? Both Lebanese. They were born in 
Lebanon. I had five, I had six children, five boys

01:25.756 --> 01:30.741
and one girl. There's only two of us left. Two boys 
and one girl left.

01:38.989 --> 01:43.774
I came to... What did your dad do for a living? We 
were very poor, extremely poor. He built a little

01:47.317 --> 01:48.899
grocery store. He was making a few dollars a day to 
keep the family alive. Were you all down in South

01:53.566 --> 01:56.409
Park or in Beaumont? No, we were in Beaumont. Did 
you go to Beaumont High? You were Royal Purple? I

01:59.732 --> 02:04.236
went to Beaumont High, but we didn't have any 
middle school. We went from the lower grades into

02:04.897 --> 02:12.424
high school directly. What led you to dream of 
going to college? Well... Did someone encourage

02:18.149 --> 02:19.871
it? Did you think of it? No. Of course I thought 
about it, but I thought about it because of a

02:23.182 --> 02:27.129
reason. And when I was a freshman in high school, a 
teacher got up and started talking something

02:28.652 --> 02:37.928
about the universe. And it triggered something in 
my mind that the Earth was more than 5,000 years

02:37.948 --> 02:47.805
old, which my Sunday school teacher was telling 
the class. So I went up to her and I said, Miss Emma,

02:48.663 --> 02:52.009
how old is the earth? She said, I can't tell you, 
Michelle. You're going to have to go to the library

02:55.216 --> 02:58.041
and find out for yourself. I said, why can't you 
tell me? She said, I won't tell you. You're going to

03:02.209 --> 03:04.674
have to go find out yourself. I said, how? She said, 
look in the books of geology. So I looked in the

03:08.356 --> 03:12.763
books in Georgia, and I got so interested in 
Georgia, I read all the books. And I found out the

03:13.765 --> 03:20.475
Earth at that time was estimated to be 3.5 billion 
years old, which is now 5.5. It took a while for me to

03:20.676 --> 03:27.466
understand why she didn't tell me. And then I 
realized that the Stokes trial was coming up. And

03:32.690 --> 03:40.859
she didn't want to have anything to do with 
evolution or anything to do with fundamentalism

03:32.690 --> 03:40.859
or anything to do with creationism. And she just 
didn't want to tell me because she was afraid she'd

03:41.800 --> 03:45.024
lose her job. And I understand that pretty well. 
And this is the reason why I became a geologist,

03:49.269 --> 03:54.334
because I wanted to be a geologist. I didn't have 
petroleum in mind. I loved the science. I still do.

04:01.023 --> 04:05.675
Did you have some other important teachers in high 
school important to you? No, I'm not going to get

04:06.156 --> 04:08.522
into that because I don't remember. What led you to 
come to Texas A&M? Why here instead of somewhere

04:12.492 --> 04:13.735
else? I didn't want to come to Texas A&M at first. I 
wanted to go to Oklahoma. I found out that Oklahoma

04:17.898 --> 04:25.348
had a great geological school, and I found out that 
that's where I wanted to go. But I had saved my money

04:26.209 --> 04:39.467
selling newspapers, working at odd jobs, and I had 
just enough money to register, and I figured that

04:26.209 --> 04:39.467
that's enough. And when I checked the portfolios 
and everything else, I found out that because I

04:39.447 --> 04:49.984
live in Texas, I'd have to pay more money to go to 
Oklahoma, and I said, I don't have it. So I started

04:50.004 --> 04:54.972
checking on Texas A&M, and I had just enough money 
to register at Texas A&M. So I decided I'd come

04:55.713 --> 05:01.322
here, because I checked and found out that they 
were going to establish a new science department.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.168
And I figured that I could be involved in the 
beginning of the science. How did you get over to

05:05.620 --> 05:08.186
A&M? Did you come on the train or the bus? Train. 
Came on the train. I landed over here at that old

05:14.059 --> 05:16.064
depot. I understand they're going to reinstate it 
or something. What did you bring with you? What

05:22.047 --> 05:22.888
kind of gear? What kind of stuff? I just have a 
small, small suitcase bag and I walked toward the

05:23.829 --> 05:38.147
administration building and went into the 
register and I found out I was $50 short.

05:41.271 --> 05:49.802
And so I was determined I wasn't going to go back 
home because I knew that if I did, I'd never see

05:41.271 --> 05:49.802
another campus in my life. that I would have to work 
to try to support the family. And so I inquired

05:55.791 --> 06:00.739
about who would be of help. And I heard some 
students say that Prexy Walton ran the

06:00.759 --> 06:05.527
institution. Prexy Walton did this and Prexy 
Walton did that. I said, well, that man must be big

06:09.594 --> 06:13.360
enough to loan me $50. So I knocked on the door and 
Mr. Williamson, who was his secretary, talked to

06:14.150 --> 06:25.495
me and wanted to know what was going on, and I told 
him. In the meantime, Walton stepped out from his

06:25.515 --> 06:30.927
office And she held him up. She was doing this. I 
didn't know what she was doing that for. So he stood

06:37.507 --> 06:39.871
at the door and listened to my tale. And I told him, I 
said, if it will owe me $50, I'll pay him back if it

06:41.053 --> 06:47.165
takes the last shirt off my back. So he said, come on 
in, young man. I walked in. He asked me something

06:52.442 --> 06:55.406
about me, something about my family. And he said, 
you came short. I said, no, I saw in the brochure

06:59.973 --> 07:04.259
that I had enough money. He said, well, there's 
some things that you have. He said, we support you,

07:07.264 --> 07:11.069
and we do a lot of things for you. And so therefore, 
you have to have $50 more. And I said, well, will you

07:16.077 --> 07:18.480
loan me that $50? We talked a while, and he said, all 
right. So he gave me two 20s and a 10, and I

07:21.485 --> 07:26.513
registered. Then I worked for 25 cents an hour 
during that whole year to pay him back, and I did.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.124
What were your jobs? My main job was rowing and 
cutting grass in front of the administration

07:36.107 --> 07:43.759
building from one end to the other. And then I 
solicited small jobs from people for cutting

07:44.313 --> 07:54.359
their yard and cutting their roses and fixing 
their lawns. Anything where I could make 25 cents,

07:55.121 --> 08:00.735
I worked. And I had my grades, took care of them, and 
I just kept working to get that 25 cents. What

08:11.275 --> 08:14.962
dormitory were you assigned as a freshman? We were 
in the shacks. And where were they? Describe the

08:17.567 --> 08:20.833
shacks, please.

08:22.450 --> 08:27.400
I don't know exactly what location, where they 
were, but it's the shacks. You ought to know

08:27.460 --> 08:29.223
something about the shacks. If you've taken 
interviews, has anyone that you've taken an

08:29.644 --> 08:36.357
interview with said that they were living in the 
shacks?

08:39.563 --> 08:39.844
Mrs. Rudder has told me a little bit about what Mr. 
Rudder remembered. I don't know whether he was

08:44.590 --> 08:50.419
young enough to be in the shacks. The shacks were 
1926, 1927. Oh, is that all? That's all. Why were

08:57.531 --> 08:58.853
they built? They were built to take care of people 
that were coming into the university. I mean, they

09:02.647 --> 09:06.774
had more students than they could accommodate in 
the dorms. I don't know whether they did or not. I

09:09.498 --> 09:10.720
have no idea. All I know is that we lived in the 
shacks. How many were in your shack? I think there

09:15.608 --> 09:16.530
were four. Four. And bunk beds? Bunk beds. Did you 
have running water? Oh yes, we had, well no, there

09:23.403 --> 09:37.315
was a common area, common area where you had, where 
you had latrines

09:23.403 --> 09:37.315
and water and even showers. There was nothing in 
the room, nothing in the shack that you could be

09:38.837 --> 09:48.405
able to wash your hands or brush your teeth or 
anything. And who were your roommates? I don't

09:52.057 --> 09:54.763
know and I don't want to talk about it. Describe a 
typical day. What time did you get up and what did

09:57.087 --> 09:59.492
you do when? I got up enough to go to classes and when 
I got back I sat down and studied. Did you study in

10:05.625 --> 10:08.010
the shack or in the library? No, in the shack. In the 
shack? Did you and your buddies ever play any jokes

10:10.113 --> 10:20.604
or do any... Oh, there were a lot of them, I guess, 
going on in that area, like there was in any other

10:10.113 --> 10:20.604
area. But hazing was very prevalent. Describe 
that, please. They beat the hell out of you. That's

10:26.329 --> 10:27.550
what they did. Sophomores, some of you ran into 
sophomores that were all right. Then you ran into

10:32.395 --> 10:38.061
some sophomores that wanted to take it out on you 
for no reason whatsoever. And I had one, all he

10:38.497 --> 10:41.101
wanted to do was beat me. And he did. And he did. And 
bent over, freshman. So I went home that

10:45.908 --> 10:47.510
Christmas. My mother came to the bed to pull the 
cover on me, and she saw blood. And when she did, she

10:55.702 --> 11:02.952
fainted over me and wanted to know why I was so 
bruised, bleeding. That's how bad it was. Now did

11:06.160 --> 11:08.645
they use boards or were they... Boards. They used 
boards about that wide. And they used anything.

11:15.039 --> 11:16.743
Some of them used coat hangers. This particular 
sophomore He just gave me a lot of trouble. He said,

11:23.629 --> 11:26.214
get a freshman, go steal me some eggs. And I had to 
run over to the farm and get eggs and bring them in,

11:26.815 --> 11:32.565
things of that kind. What would he do with the eggs? 
Did he eat them? I don't know what he did with them,

11:34.909 --> 11:38.996
but he harassed me to no end. And he said, I don't 
like anybody from Beaumont. I don't like anybody

11:42.943 --> 11:44.987
from Beaumont, Tyson. So I just took it because I 
wanted to stay. And so I worked at the Spieser as a

11:49.622 --> 11:53.706
waiter. And the last day that we were going to have

11:55.368 --> 12:10.705
lunch in Spieser, I was carrying this tray of milk, 
coffee, And I think it was honey and other things.

12:17.772 --> 12:19.753
And I was just carrying it to the table. And I saw 
this guy. And I guess the devil got a hold of me. He

12:25.779 --> 12:27.240
said, dump it all over him. And I did. And he got up. 
He said, I'll kill you, freshman. I said, no, you

12:32.565 --> 12:33.826
won't. Not anymore. You bastard. Sit down. And 
then I decided I'm going to do everything I can to

12:40.030 --> 12:47.919
eliminate hazing in this institution. And when I 
was a sophomore, I really worked. I went to the

12:52.624 --> 12:56.368
officials at this university. I went even to 
members of the Board of Regents. I told them that we

12:59.792 --> 13:01.714
ought to stop this thing. And finally they did. 
They did it the year that I was there. That's good.

13:09.258 --> 13:13.384
Describe President Walton as a human. President 
Walton was a wonderful man. He was very

13:15.908 --> 13:18.652
compassionate. Otherwise, he wouldn't have 
loaned me that $50. He took a chance on me for $50 to

13:22.097 --> 13:25.382
him. Might have been something that he didn't want 
to get rid of, but he loaned it to me because of the

13:25.763 --> 13:32.513
way I talked to him. I told him, I said, you don't 
have to worry about that $50. It'll be paid. And it

13:36.759 --> 13:37.560
was. He was big man? What size? He was, yes, he was 
about I would say 6'2", if I remember correctly. He

13:46.031 --> 13:48.314
was kind of half bald in a way. Very delightful man. 
And his secretary was so good. Now his office was in

13:55.342 --> 13:58.645
the academic building? In the old administration 
building. In the old administration building.

14:03.711 --> 14:04.712
You know where that is? The one with the dome? Yeah. 
Yeah. Yeah. Now that's called the academic

14:08.921 --> 14:10.643
building. I didn't know. I just called it the 
administration building from the time I got here.

14:15.949 --> 14:22.337
Did students attempt to play any tricks on the 
Waltons at their house? Not that I know of. Not that

14:24.400 --> 14:26.582
I know of. Were you majoring in geology your first 
year? They didn't have geology per se. They had

14:33.258 --> 14:34.059
science. Yes, sir. And then I particularly 
majored myself. I just went to the main libraries

14:39.526 --> 14:45.574
and took all the books I could on geology. And then 
the professor that was teaching me the science

14:46.114 --> 14:54.645
knew that I was interested in geology and he helped 
me. Who was that? Do you remember? I don't remember

14:56.280 --> 14:59.385
his name. I think his name was Bert. But anyway, Dr. 
Lonsdale came in when I was a junior, and he added

15:03.130 --> 15:10.681
the department. He created the Department of 
Geology. And then I decided that I was going to just

15:14.246 --> 15:21.797
be a scientist, and I wanted to study geology. All 
right, that first year, You got your job pretty

15:24.663 --> 15:26.747
quickly. You worked mowing the grass and also at 
Sabisa your first year. Had both those jobs. What,

15:36.304 --> 15:37.506
Sabisa? You worked at Sabisa. Oh, I worked at 
Sabisa. I worked at a restaurant called the Greasy

15:41.293 --> 15:46.602
Spoon. Yes, oh. And I worked there for 25 cents an 
hour. I was a waiter. I worked in a grocery store,

15:52.027 --> 15:59.099
helping the man serve the people in that area. I 
worked in every way possible. And earning 25 cents

16:02.625 --> 16:06.331
was arduous. And they had a confectionery in the 
old YMCA building. And I'd go in there, and I'd see

16:11.660 --> 16:18.311
these people ordering thick malts. And they'd put 
one ice cream and malt, ice cream and malt. And I'd

16:22.378 --> 16:24.121
sit there, and I'd look at it. I'd say, gee, I guess 
one of these things, I got to buy one. It cost $0.25.

16:29.210 --> 16:36.137
And finally I saved 25 cents, and I said, now I'm 
going to go get my thick bolt. I went to that, and I

16:36.157 --> 16:42.403
said, what do you want, freshman?

16:46.147 --> 16:48.310
Give me a sarsaparilla for a nickel.

16:50.752 --> 16:56.618
I just couldn't spend 25 cents knowing how hard I 
was working. Now, you went to class. In the

17:01.225 --> 17:03.008
afternoons, you worked. I worked whenever I 
could. I worked sometime at night. The

17:09.358 --> 17:15.127
upperclassmen asked me to do something, go to the 
library, get them a book, something like that.

17:15.528 --> 17:18.673
He'd give me 10 cents, 20 cents, 25 cents. I just 
kept every nickel I could possibly make. About

17:21.967 --> 17:22.608
what time? I ran into old books at the end of the half 
semester. There were books and I'd pick them up and

17:33.463 --> 17:39.050
I'd sell them. The library then, was Tommy Mayo the 
librarian still? I don't know. Professor of

17:43.926 --> 17:44.768
English? I don't know. Was the library a pleasant 
place then? Yes. Now what other kinds of hazing was

17:50.701 --> 17:55.711
there in addition to the paddling? What else did a 
freshman have to do? Abusive, abusive,

17:57.715 --> 18:01.283
harassment. And there were some sophomores that 
were, I think, a little bit vengeful for every

18:03.018 --> 18:18.902
reason whatsoever. And they would get mad at 
themselves and take it out on the freshmen. I've

18:23.208 --> 18:30.038
seen them whip freshmen that did nothing except 
they just wanted to get somebody to whip. It was a

18:30.018 --> 18:33.023
bad, bad two years. Bad, bad. Do you remember 
going, as a freshman, going to the football games?

18:38.933 --> 18:39.373
Oh, yes. Describe that. I was working for a family 
between here and Bryan. I was taking care of the

18:48.361 --> 18:58.938
yard, and I'd go in there and work for the last hour, 
four or five, from four to five, or five to six, or

18:48.361 --> 18:58.938
even from six to seven if I could. I'd work two 
hours, and she'd give me 50 cents. And then one

19:03.906 --> 19:09.535
Saturday, I went over there early, and she saw me 
outside. She said, what are you doing outside? I

19:11.197 --> 19:11.618
said, show. I said, well, I'm going to work four 
hours with you. I need that dollar. She said, I'm

19:17.407 --> 19:20.092
not going to pay you today. You get back and go to see 
that football game. She said, that's part of your

19:27.123 --> 19:29.106
education. I said, I don't want you to be just 
working all the time. I said, well, I have to. She

19:33.793 --> 19:35.496
said, no, just you go. So I went and I realized what 
she was telling me, that I have other things to do

19:36.742 --> 19:43.574
besides working. And I did. Did you all march into 
the game the way the Corps does now? No, I don't

19:48.442 --> 19:50.325
think we marched in. We marched to speeds of uh-oh, 
things like that, but I don't remember marching

19:50.665 --> 19:57.777
into the game. Did you stand up at the games? Oh yes. 
We did that regardless of that. Regardless of that

20:03.478 --> 20:07.724
12th band and anything else, we did that because we 
wanted to. What kinds of things did the students do

20:08.444 --> 20:11.949
during the games? Same thing they're doing now. 
Did anybody do any drinking during the game? No, I

20:18.196 --> 20:19.497
don't think so. There might have been one or two, 
you know, but it was never shown. It was never

20:27.026 --> 20:30.070
demonstrated in any way. Were there many dates? 
Did the Aggies have dates? Oh, yeah. Yeah, they

20:35.109 --> 20:41.178
went to Navasota, Hearn, any place where they can 
get dates. And a lot of girls came down for special

20:41.258 --> 20:48.108
occasions from Ditton, which was that time. It was 
then CIA. Yeah. And Brian supplied a lot of girls.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.183
And we got along all right. Being in the military 
school, it was the greatest thing that ever

20:58.417 --> 21:04.485
happened to me because we were so poor. I couldn't 
buy clothes, and when you passed the physical

21:05.106 --> 21:20.325
examination and were accepted as a student, they 
gave you two sets of uniforms, and that was clothes

21:05.106 --> 21:20.325
that I couldn't have bought. And I loved the Corps. 
I really loved the Corps. What did you like best

21:23.629 --> 21:25.892
about the Corps? Well, I was learning something 
about the military and also about the history of

21:27.661 --> 21:40.174
the United States, the wars that have been fought 
and the wars that have been fought elsewhere. So it

21:40.775 --> 21:47.782
was an exhilarating experience just to be a member 
of the Corps and be at A&M. I don't think we had, when

21:47.802 --> 21:55.390
I was a freshman, I don't think we had 1,800, 1,900 
students. When I graduated, I think there were

21:55.977 --> 21:58.960
just a little over 2,000. Almost all of them lived 
on campus? All of them on campus,

22:03.844 --> 22:25.562
all in the cadet corps, except there was one house, 
one dormitory, in which there were 40

22:03.844 --> 22:25.562
students who couldn't pass the examination for 
some handicap or something like that. And they

22:25.880 --> 22:33.171
would accept them, put them in this dormitory, and 
we referred to them as casuals. So they didn't wear

22:34.393 --> 22:35.655
a uniform? No, no, no. But they were all boys? Oh, 
yeah, absolutely. Were there any, in the early

22:40.562 --> 22:47.733
20s, there were two or three faculty daughters 
allowed to attend classes. Were there any girls

22:47.833 --> 22:51.098
attending any classes when you were here? I don't 
remember. Well, I bet you would if there were

22:52.947 --> 22:54.649
girls. I don't remember. Dr. Ball had a beautiful 
daughter. And Dr. Ball, he was a science teacher, a

23:04.543 --> 23:12.053
biology teacher, I think. Funny, I can remember 
him. And we became very good friends. And it could

23:18.903 --> 23:24.111
be possible that his daughter attended some 
classes. Now, were there faculty members already

23:24.812 --> 23:30.280
living on the campus in the houses over here? Sure, 
yes, yes. That's where most of them lived. That's

23:34.606 --> 23:35.387
what I thought. And did students ever bother any of 
those houses, any of their yards? No. No, that's

23:43.994 --> 23:47.198
the thing about A&M students. You never saw all 
that furrow and the disobedience and things of

23:47.218 --> 23:56.027
that kind. They just didn't exist. I remember in 
the 60s when everybody and all of the students all

23:58.390 --> 24:07.420
over the country were were not only harassing,

24:07.400 --> 24:16.774
but they were going against the institutions. And 
they would have demonstrations, one

24:17.475 --> 24:21.922
demonstration after the other. So some of the 
students here decided they wanted to

24:23.424 --> 24:27.670
demonstrate. And they got together and they 
decided they were going to lead those who joined

24:29.694 --> 24:36.023
them right outside to show their strength. Rudder 
heard about it, and Rudder went over to, got an

24:42.629 --> 24:52.046
opportunity to talk to all of them that's going to 
demonstrate. He said, that's fine. I'm glad

24:53.950 --> 24:55.713
you're going to demonstrate. He said, I'm going to 
lead you right out of this campus, and you're not

24:56.514 --> 25:00.762
coming back. So I guess you heard that story. I was 
here at that time. You were? And I remember

25:06.255 --> 25:15.898
sometimes he would say, in order to do some of that, 
you're going to have to walk over this pot-bellied

25:06.255 --> 25:15.898
president, and I'm going to stand right here. He 
was a great man. I loved him. He was splendid. He was

25:19.795 --> 25:20.556
splendid. I loved him. What was your core outfit? 
Black Eye Company. Black Eye. Black Eye. Oh, I

25:28.550 --> 25:30.473
mean, I'll tell you that. There were some people in 
there that, they just, they were rowdy, you know.

25:35.361 --> 25:39.629
They would do things and have a lot of tricks. 
Describe some of those tricks. Oh, Lord, I don't

25:41.552 --> 25:42.814
know. Did they do anything ever in the dining hall 
to somebody else's food? No, you know what the

25:49.313 --> 25:53.038
routine was since you've been here. Freshmen had 
to eat under the table, had to eat their kush under

25:54.180 --> 26:00.309
the table, all things like that. But Black Eye 
Company, for some reason, had a reputation of

26:00.370 --> 26:13.189
being a little rowdy and disobedient from time to 
time, but it was a good company. right and when

26:13.169 --> 26:42.940
y'all it was infantry when y'all fell out to march 
to y'all march to sabisa for your meals then where

26:13.169 --> 26:42.940
did y'all drill in the afternoon no well whenever 
we were forced to drill because of the of the of the

26:13.169 --> 26:42.940
program we drilled on the field on the drill field 
oh yeah and uh uh did y'all use aggie terminology

26:13.169 --> 26:42.940
did you have a fish old lady Oh, yeah, they had 
fish-o-laters. And did you all have the slang in

26:47.751 --> 26:50.014
the dining room? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, they had the 
slang. Were there Kush questions? Kush was

26:56.584 --> 26:59.929
dessert. But did they have Kush questions that a 
freshman couldn't eat Kush unless he could answer

26:59.949 --> 27:04.736
the question? Oh, they had things like that, yeah. 
What was your favorite Sbisa Hall food? What did

27:11.426 --> 27:12.488
you like best? Oh, I don't know. I was hungry. I was 
so hungry, I ate everything. It didn't make any

27:18.646 --> 27:21.109
difference. And then when I worked in this greasy 
spoon restaurant, he gave me 25 cents an hour, and I

27:21.230 --> 27:29.881
could eat one meal. And I ate chili and eggs, 
because that's the best thing he cooked. Where was

27:36.550 --> 27:37.812
the greasy spoon? In that area. Just Northgate? 
Yes, I guess you'd call it that. Do you remember who

27:43.996 --> 27:45.237
operated it? No, I don't remember.

27:50.646 --> 27:57.917
Where did you and your friends go on a Saturday 
night if you were going to try to have a good time?

27:57.937 --> 28:03.886
Well, I didn't participate too much on the 
Saturday night or Friday night or whatever it was.

28:03.926 --> 28:09.475
I didn't have the money, and I refused to have 
people buy me things. So I didn't participate too

28:10.214 --> 28:11.936
much. Well, where did the other guys, where were 
their favorite places on a Saturday night? Oh,

28:16.681 --> 28:25.230
they had some places where they got beers or 
whatever it is, but I never participated in that.

28:25.730 --> 28:27.793
Was there a bootlegger in Brazos County? I don't 
know. There must have been some. Did any of the

28:30.816 --> 28:34.500
students have whiskey in the... I've seen 
students with whiskey, yes. Because that was

28:37.417 --> 28:39.199
during Prohibition, so. Yeah, I've seen them 
with. I've seen some that were drunk, had gotten

28:42.202 --> 28:48.569
drunk and had little problems. Did anybody get 
kicked out of school for drunkenness? I don't

28:52.152 --> 28:53.274
know. I imagine some were, but I don't know. As you 
look back on that first year, what were the best

28:56.157 --> 28:59.961
classes? What were the courses that made an 
impression on you? Science. Science. About how

29:04.940 --> 29:07.162
big was a class then? How many? Five, six, maybe 
eight. And how well had Beaumont... When I took my

29:15.131 --> 29:17.214
master's degree, there were only two. How well 
prepared had Beaumont High made you for college?

29:23.180 --> 29:24.842
How well did you do that first year? Oh, I did all 
right in my high school years. No, but were you...

29:32.362 --> 29:35.045
Were you well prepared for college? I was well 
prepared for college because of my determination

29:36.386 --> 29:43.934
and wanting to be a geoscientist. Where did you get 
your slide rule? You know, I was looking for my

29:47.938 --> 29:53.003
slide rule the other day, and I said, it's got to be 
here, and I couldn't find it. I had two. I had one

29:54.524 --> 29:57.087
about this big, and I had one about that big. And we 
had some professors would give us a tolerance of

29:58.636 --> 30:05.707
2%, 3%. And I had one that gave us a tolerance of 5%. 
But we learned our mathematics. We used our slide

30:14.200 --> 30:17.766
rule and we carried it. Everybody carried it with 
them. It doesn't make any difference. God, if we'd

30:21.434 --> 30:27.260
had the computers and what we had then, what we got 
now. Some of the studies that have taken place, in

30:29.943 --> 30:36.530
my opinion, are lackadaisical. They're not using 
the brain like they should. Now, did you bring your

30:39.714 --> 30:42.957
slide rule with you, or did you buy it after you 
bought it? Oh, I bought it here. You bought it here.

30:44.739 --> 30:45.159
Oh, yeah. Do you remember what it cost? No, no, I 
don't, but I bought it on time. Was it new or used? I

30:51.252 --> 30:57.079
know that my little one was used, but the big one 
that I really needed, I bought new. And I made

30:57.539 --> 31:01.985
arrangements with the people I bought it from, I'd 
pay them back. Did you buy it at a place off campus,

31:02.005 --> 31:06.210
or was there a bookstore on campus? It didn't have a 
bookstore on campus. I bought it off campus. When I

31:10.374 --> 31:19.125
got my ring, for instance,

31:10.374 --> 31:19.125
I wanted a diamond put in there. Can you see it? Yes, 
sir. Yes, sir. So I went to the jewelry store and I

31:21.745 --> 31:27.932
asked him if I could have a diamond. He said, yes. So 
he brought me some out. I asked him, how much is

31:31.375 --> 31:32.557
that? He said, $10. I said, I haven't got that. I 
can't pay that. He brought another one out, $5. I

31:38.483 --> 31:40.746
can't pay that either. So we kept looking, kept 
looking. He finally said, what do you want? I said,

31:44.670 --> 31:45.711
I just want another.
