WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:05.401
For many years? Yes, she has been living in Austin 
for about 15 or 20 years. Does she have a husband in

00:13.914 --> 00:16.759
Austin? No, she is alone. She is living with a son 
who lives in Austin.

00:26.053 --> 00:31.101
She has a son and a granddaughter. Y una hija que 
vivía en Austin pero ya se fue. Se cambiaron para

00:36.251 --> 00:38.173
Mirla. Sí. Y tengo otra hermana que vive en Lobo. 
¿Sí? ¿Otra? Ella tiene como 20 años de vida.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.833
Y son todos los hermanos que tengo. Y todos sus 
hermanos vivían aquí en los Estados Unidos. Sí.

00:58.260 --> 00:58.360
Sí. Ahorita tengo nomás tres hermanos vivos. Sí. 
And his mother lived here, but his father died in

01:03.194 --> 01:12.262
Mexico. Yes, she died here. He died many years 
before his family came here to Texas, right? I

01:24.554 --> 01:25.775
understand. His father. Oh, yes, yes. Many years. 
Yes, well, my mother used to talk I was 4 years old

01:32.371 --> 01:33.893
when he died. Where

01:35.295 --> 01:39.421
did he die? He died here in General Treviño. I was 
talking to my mother

01:46.731 --> 01:54.923
that he was dead. What was his age? I think he was 
sick. I think they didn't have a lot of money to get a

02:00.873 --> 02:08.464
doctor or a hospital.

02:18.418 --> 02:20.821
Life was difficult in those days. It was difficult 
for the people who lived there. I think it's still

02:27.170 --> 02:30.475
very difficult for many people.

02:32.935 --> 02:35.539
For example, when you have a sick person, well... I 
don't know, but... I think there are many very poor

02:40.027 --> 02:46.498
people who... who can barely afford to eat during 
the day. Yes, and Mexico? I think so. Now? Now. But

02:51.127 --> 02:57.793
here, are there people who live here who don't have 
enough to eat? Here, yes. Here, the people who

02:59.314 --> 03:03.578
don't have enough to eat are the ones who don't want 
to work. Because there is a lot of work anywhere.

03:09.784 --> 03:10.684
Here. And the people who don't have enough to eat 
are the ones who don't want to work.

03:17.170 --> 03:18.111
But in Mexico? No, in Mexico it's different. It's 
cheaper. It's possible to... It's very

03:24.764 --> 03:30.730
expensive, everything.

03:30.891 --> 03:31.231
Yes. But it's edible. Yes. The food. And here it's 
also expensive, well, but... The people who are

03:42.782 --> 03:44.504
hungry... It's because either the wife or the 
children don't want to work. Yes. Because here

03:48.940 --> 03:54.228
there is a lot of work for any person, be it a man or a 
woman. Right now it's a bit expensive here, but as

03:54.348 --> 04:11.434
it were, you can eat.

04:11.594 --> 04:15.720
Is the opportunity for education good here? Of 
course, yes. Is it good in Mexico? Yes, it is good.

04:23.058 --> 04:34.132
People who have money to continue their studies, 
it's good. Poor people can't go to school or finish

04:34.152 --> 04:46.167
school

04:34.152 --> 04:46.167
because they are very poor. The father has to get 
the children out of school so that they can go to

04:46.822 --> 04:56.813
work, so that he can help them to maintain all the 
families. And there are many. Yes. And there are

04:58.474 --> 05:00.516
many families. Yes. Well, it's a problem here too. 
Yes, here too, yes. Yes. Yes, but here they have a

05:08.185 --> 05:11.808
much better chance. Yes? Yes. A much better 
chance. Yes, a chance for... para acabar con sus

05:16.538 --> 05:18.602
estudios.

05:22.008 --> 05:24.793
¿Conoce otros parques de los Estados Unidos?

05:27.658 --> 05:28.039
No. ¿Nunca trabajó en el norte? No, there are only 
wolves pecking at the cotton once or twice. Only in

05:36.437 --> 05:38.279
Lubbock? Only. But some people here go to... Oh 
yes, they go to California and other states. Yes?

05:45.786 --> 05:47.968
No, only here. Why don't you go to these other 
parts? I don't like to go there and there and there.

05:56.097 --> 05:58.880
I'm working here. I'm working very well here. Yes. 
Because here I am working with these ladies. Here I

06:07.123 --> 06:09.285
work as if it were mine. All over the place. Yes. 
It's a good job here. Because I... I leave here in

06:18.415 --> 06:23.740
the morning with my little truck. I'm going to do 
whatever I want, as if it were mine. If they need me,

06:31.936 --> 06:34.279
They talk to me. If they have another job, they do 
it. Yes. But I don't come to ask them in the mornings

06:38.766 --> 06:48.180
here, what job

06:38.766 --> 06:48.180
am I going to do now? No. But I go out there, I do 
anything there. There is a country to break there.

06:55.891 --> 06:56.452
I compose it. The water, the gas, whatever. Yes. 
And I've had this job for many years,

07:00.202 --> 07:05.811
I think. From the plumbing. It's a house for you, a 
house of

07:07.233 --> 07:13.503
many years, yes. Well, your wife was from a ranch 
near here, correct? Yes. And she was born in Mexico

07:21.816 --> 07:25.542
or in Mexico as well? Yes, she was born in Mexico. 
When did she come

07:28.163 --> 07:36.312
to the United States? Her father

07:37.633 --> 07:43.279
talked to her. She came around 1916, I think. 1916 
and what? 16. 16. Two years before her family.

07:52.790 --> 07:55.993
Where in Mexico?

08:02.588 --> 08:04.050
Zacatecas. Zacatecas. It's very far. Zacatecas. 
And for what reason? Well, I think the reason is

08:13.902 --> 08:24.174
that they came to look for life to have a better 
time, I think. Yes. They are poor people. They are

08:26.416 --> 08:28.579
poor people from Zacatecas. From the city of 
Zacatecas, or a ranch in the state. I think it's a

08:33.209 --> 08:39.454
ranch, but it's called Zacatecas because it's the 
same state. Yes. It's a city, Zacatecas, and it's

08:42.197 --> 08:46.340
the state. And the state, I think they lived in a 
ranch, I think. Yes, in Zacatecas.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.431
And they didn't come because of the revolution? I 
don't know. I don't think

09:00.268 --> 09:05.136
so. I don't know the life of them

09:05.457 --> 09:16.536
correctly. No. Do you know anyone who came here 
because of the revolution?

09:27.301 --> 09:34.608
No one says this is the reason for coming to

09:27.301 --> 09:34.608
Texas. When I came here to live here, all those 
people were already living here. And all those

09:43.496 --> 09:53.286
people, the older ones, we came with the uncle from 
Concire, a ranch that the uncle had. They called it

09:53.306 --> 09:55.688
Rancho Grande. They told me that this is how the 
ranch is called. It's called Kenere. Yes. That's

10:01.413 --> 10:03.996
where the uncle came from. And that's where a lot of 
men came to work here with him. Yes. They were

10:09.643 --> 10:11.305
working with him in the ranch.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.933
And those men were already here working for when I 
came.

10:23.359 --> 10:25.742
And it's for... a reason for a better life.

10:39.964 --> 10:40.626
Some people that I know come to this country 
because of the revolution. Yes, some because they

10:47.634 --> 11:02.575
tell me that the soldiers come to their town and 
make war in the town and things like that. And for

11:02.595 --> 11:05.358
this reason they came here. Yes, they came here. 
Yes. I've heard that when a bunch of soldiers came

11:11.302 --> 11:30.685
to a village, they collected all the

11:11.302 --> 11:30.685
food for them, for the soldiers. Food and corn for 
the horses and all that. I think that's why many

11:34.290 --> 11:35.411
came here. And I think that There were many places 
where I think I've heard other older people talk.

11:47.006 --> 11:50.671
Yes.

11:50.691 --> 11:55.418
That many times they took people and put them in as 
soldiers. Yes. I think for that reason many came

11:56.580 --> 11:58.943
here.

12:02.045 --> 12:10.897
And they who came for this reason, do they spend all 
their lives here or did they return to Mexico after

12:02.045 --> 12:10.897
the Revolution? Well, I think that when the 
Revolution ended, I think that many of them

12:11.017 --> 12:17.246
returned there and others stayed here, I think.

12:20.230 --> 12:20.490
Yes. Many young people, I think, got married here 
and I think they stayed here. Yes. The older ones

12:28.032 --> 12:33.777
would come back, I think, again. Yes. The older 
ones. Why the older ones? Well, let's see,

12:37.100 --> 12:39.943
because... They would have their little house 
there, little animals that they had in the ranch,

12:39.963 --> 12:51.294
or something like that, right? Yes. That's why 
they would come back, I think. And the younger

12:53.696 --> 12:56.959
ones, well, I think they became... I think some of 
them got married and stayed here.

13:06.326 --> 13:07.848
It's partly a matter of heart. The older ones have 
more heart in medicine. They have more head to go

13:12.413 --> 13:21.003
back, thinking about what they left there. And the 
young ones, well, No, no, no, no piensa mucho en

13:26.065 --> 13:33.499
regresar por lo que dejaron allá los papás. Sí. 
Mayormente si se casa aquí, bueno, ya disimula un

13:36.204 --> 13:46.803
poco de lo que tienen allá, dejan allá.

13:46.823 --> 13:48.546
Sí, yo creo es la verdad. Es indiferencia.

13:54.888 --> 14:00.717
Y ellos que vienen, que estaban ricos, ¿están 
diferentes de los pobres? ¿Qué piensa usted? ¿Los

14:03.782 --> 14:04.543
ricos? Sí. ¿Qué son las diferencias entre los 
ricos y los pobres aquí en los Estados Unidos?

14:13.117 --> 14:19.427
Bueno,

14:13.117 --> 14:19.427
pues el rico...

14:23.727 --> 14:28.694
Well, I can't speak very bad of them either. No? 
Because the rich have their money. And the poor,

14:33.041 --> 14:39.130
well, they spend it with the little they earn.

14:42.215 --> 14:42.495
Yes. That's the only difference here. And in 
Mexico it's the same. In Mexico it's the same. It's

14:49.686 --> 14:50.347
the same. It's the same. Well, thank you

14:53.613 --> 15:09.268
very much for... Well, thank you very much, ma'am. 
It's been a pleasure to meet you. Yes, the same to

15:12.311 --> 15:16.135
you. I'm Cruz Sanchez. Yes.
