WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:08.036
Monday, August 15th, 1977.

00:08.236 --> 00:10.961
It's about quarter to four in the afternoon. We're 
talking with Thomas Ramirez Ugalde.

00:15.708 --> 00:20.436
U-L-G-A-L-D-E.

00:15.708 --> 00:20.436
U-G-A-L-D-E.

00:29.225 --> 00:37.573
Okay, we're going to need to go over some of the 
stuff you and I talked about beforehand, okay, so

00:29.225 --> 00:37.573
we can get it on tape. No, that's all right. That's 
okay.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.924
Now that we're both sitting straight. Okay, I need 
to know again, you were born in what year? I was born

00:56.249 --> 00:59.232
the 29th day of December. 29th day of December, 
1890. And where were you born? I was born in a coal

01:06.679 --> 01:08.261
mine. They call it Lida, Lida, something like 
that. Lida? Yeah. And where is that? That's in

01:14.509 --> 01:18.934
Latascoso County, Texas. Texas, and near what big 
city? Oh, San Antonio. San Antonio, okay. How old

01:24.921 --> 01:28.125
were you when you moved to the Rockdale area? Well, 
it was about... A little bit, but I don't remember

01:31.932 --> 01:35.336
about eight months or ten months. Eight or ten 
months. How

01:36.377 --> 01:41.402
did you learn English? Well, I tell you, I didn't go 
to school. But I learned it at the old Compras coal

01:45.847 --> 01:49.531
mine. There was a bunch of Negroes. They come from 
Alabama. And they had little kids. And I was a

01:57.039 --> 01:58.861
little kid, and I played with them. That's the way I 
learned it. I see. I see. What were your parents

02:02.746 --> 02:04.348
doing? They were working at the coal mines. At the 
coal mines. Were the Negro children's parents

02:07.853 --> 02:12.418
working at the coal mines, too? Yeah, there was 
Negro men. They came in from Alabama, and they was

02:14.441 --> 02:18.085
working at the coal mines. Of course, a bunch of 
kids, you know, we played together. Me and Austin

02:22.771 --> 02:24.373
Garcia. Yeah. And Ben Torres. Antonio Rodriguez, 
a bunch of kids. And where was the compressed coal

02:35.873 --> 02:38.939
mines? It's right where we went into Texas, you 
know, across the railroad, where the compressed

02:38.959 --> 02:45.891
is on this side. I see, on the other side, on the 
north side of Highway 79. Yes, sir. Okay. Were

02:51.400 --> 02:54.366
there very many black people that worked the 
mines? Yeah, yeah. Do any of them still live around

02:55.936 --> 02:58.160
the Rockdale area? No, I don't think so. They all 
moved away? They all moved down in the ground. What

03:03.629 --> 03:04.471
do you mean by that? Died. They died? They died in 
the mines? No, they died up in town, you see. After

03:09.900 --> 03:14.829
the compressed mine, they worked it out, you know. 
They didn't work no more. They didn't have no more

03:16.912 --> 03:18.375
coal mines. There was most of the colored people 
there moved to town. I see. And what year was that?

03:23.557 --> 03:24.098
Do you remember? I don't remember. I was a little 
fellow then. A little fellow.

03:30.045 --> 03:30.226
Okay. Could you describe a typical week at the 
mine? You know, what you did on Monday and Tuesday

03:35.853 --> 03:38.216
and Wednesday? Well, that's all we done. That's 
all you did was mine coal? Yeah. That's all we done,

03:42.522 --> 03:44.444
coal. You were telling me earlier that you... went 
down in the mines with your father. Yeah. And about

03:50.712 --> 03:51.794
how old were you? About eight years, eight, nine 
years, something like that. And why would you go

03:55.659 --> 03:57.721
down in the mines with him? Well, just to keep 
company with him. Because there was a lot of people

04:00.145 --> 04:09.937
working, you know, but still he says, if you run 
around out here, you might get in trouble with

04:00.145 --> 04:09.937
these kids, and you just want to go stay with me down 
in the coal mine. Were there many other children

04:09.957 --> 04:11.880
your age down there? Oh, yes. Mexican and college. 
I see. And how old were you when you yourself

04:19.315 --> 04:23.419
started mining? Myself? Yeah, right. When I 
started working? For the mines. Huh? Yeah, when

04:28.683 --> 04:30.645
you started coal mining yourself. Oh, well, I 
don't know. I was about, let's see, about 14. About

04:36.069 --> 04:36.250
14. Did your parents have to sign a letter to let you 
work? Signed some papers, so I didn't know.

04:43.816 --> 04:43.916
Okay. And when you were 14, were you working at the 
Vogel mine? Vogel's mine, yeah. What time of the

04:49.707 --> 04:52.471
day would you go down into the mine? Well, it was... 
They had steps going in the coal mine. And the...

05:01.163 --> 05:07.071
Willie Helson, his father, he opened it. They had a 
little door, you know, with a lock to keep people

05:07.151 --> 05:14.341
from going in there in the night and do damage down 
in the mine, you see? Right. And he opened it up

05:15.403 --> 05:18.347
about 6 o'clock in the morning, then we... Some 
people go down early, some of them went down a

05:18.698 --> 05:22.122
little late. I see. So the miners had pretty much 
free reign as to when they could go down and when

05:23.283 --> 05:28.650
they could come up? Yeah. I see. What time did you 
usually go down? Well, we usually go down about

05:31.573 --> 05:33.956
6.30. 6.30. The people that decode for some mule 
drivers and the truck man, they all started at 7

05:36.479 --> 05:44.289
o'clock. I see. And how long would they work during 
the day? They worked, I think, until 6. Until 6? I

05:50.061 --> 05:51.743
think they were working 10 hours. 10 hours a day? 
Yeah. Did they have an hour off for lunch? Yeah. I

05:56.549 --> 05:56.669
see. Did you take your lunch down with you, or did 
you come up at lunch? Well, a lot of people take

06:00.013 --> 06:02.957
their lunch with them, a lot of them. And some of 
them were the ladies. The man that had a wife,

06:06.441 --> 06:13.630
they'd take it out to the cold, while the chef was, 
you know, and put it in the elevator. At 12 o'clock,

06:14.048 --> 06:17.092
they let all the lunch down. What was usually in a 
lunch? What kind of lunch did you eat? Well, we ate

06:21.759 --> 06:28.428
just potatoes and bacon, the things like that. And 
then in the afternoon, what time would you come up

06:28.448 --> 06:33.896
out of the coal mine? Well, the mentors, they could 
come out any time. Or you could go down any time they

06:36.380 --> 06:40.806
wanted you. And you were telling me earlier, how 
many... coal cars a day did you mine using? Well,

06:48.271 --> 06:48.972
I'll tell you. Here at this coal mine, I was not very 
much of a hand, but I could dig six, five, six,

06:50.053 --> 07:00.065
seven, eight cars of coal. And how much were you 
paid per car? Twenty cents. Twenty cents? Did that

07:05.811 --> 07:08.234
rate ever go up or down? Oh, yeah. In the 
summertime, they paid 25 cents. And why was that?

07:14.793 --> 07:21.483
Well, you see, they want the people, they had more 
orders for coal, and they want the people to work

07:14.793 --> 07:21.483
more. And they didn't want the people to get out and 
go to the cotton field. That's why they get paid 25,

07:26.791 --> 07:31.639
I mean 5 cents more on each car. And that was during 
the summertime? Yes. I see. How much would you get

07:34.724 --> 07:37.829
paid for picking cotton? Well... I don't remember 
exactly. But 25 cents a coal car was more than you

07:41.344 --> 07:45.469
would get picking cotton? Oh, yeah, yeah. Of 
course, now you take some good hands and know how to

07:47.392 --> 07:51.598
pick cotton, well, they picked a lot of cotton. And 
I think they was getting about, I don't know, 50

07:53.120 --> 07:58.387
cents per hundred, something like that. 50 cents 
per hundred pounds of cotton? Okay. What kind of

08:03.314 --> 08:06.338
machinery was there around the mines? Well, the 
kind of machine they had, there was all of them

08:06.976 --> 08:13.504
steam engines, all of them. That's what they did. 
Now, to pull the, to bring the coal to the shaft,

08:15.627 --> 08:21.594
they used mules. Inside the mine? Inside the mine, 
yes. And they would put the... The coal where? I

08:29.735 --> 08:30.736
mean, the coal car. After the mule pulled it to the 
shaft, where would it go? Then they put it in the

08:33.880 --> 08:35.723
elevator. We call them cages. Cages. Yeah. But 
they put them in the elevator and bring them to the

08:38.306 --> 08:41.931
top and dump it. And the triple, you know, and they 
had a chute. A chute. And where would that chute go

08:45.596 --> 08:46.958
to? Into the railroad car. Railroad

08:51.384 --> 08:54.649
car. Okay. What kind of tools did you use when you 
were mining? Pick and shovel, that's all he used.

08:59.589 --> 09:00.570
That's all. One thing I've been unclear about, 
Tomas, and that is, you had a straight shaft with an

09:01.171 --> 09:08.719
elevator, or a cage, as you call it. Yeah. And then 
you had one main tunnel. Yeah. And then you had

09:12.103 --> 09:14.986
offshoots, or little rooms, off the tunnel. Yeah, 
rooms, entries. Right. Were there cave-ins? Were

09:18.290 --> 09:19.111
there very many cave-ins? Well, some of them were 
cave-ins, but most of them had chambers. But for

09:22.014 --> 09:24.216
the vein of the coal... It was about seven feet and a 
half, eight feet. You know, we didn't take all the

09:27.086 --> 09:30.851
coal off. That will hold the dirt, you know. 
Leaving some of the coal would hold the dirt in

09:34.316 --> 09:37.921
place. Did the miners put the timbers up or did 
somebody else come in? No, we had to put them up

09:41.627 --> 09:44.852
because we'd get paid 25 cents for each. For cap, 
cross piece, like this, you know. This is a cross

09:49.859 --> 09:52.583
piece and this is a prop. two props, one prop here, 
one prop there, and a cross bead. Then they put

09:57.138 --> 10:00.100
some, what they call leggings. Leggings? They 
have about, some of them was three inches in

10:01.461 --> 10:06.546
diameter, some of them less, and some of them a 
little more. And we put them like that, you know, to

10:06.566 --> 10:11.169
keep the place from caving. So, and you got paid for 
doing that also? Oh yeah, yeah. 25 cents for each

10:14.512 --> 10:16.434
set of timbers. 25 cents for each set of timbers? 
Well, did that pay more than digging coal? Well,

10:23.849 --> 10:29.056
You see, you had to put up a set of timbers about 
every five feet. So you just put up one set a day. I

10:33.983 --> 10:34.344
see. So you would get paid for maybe perhaps six car 
loads a day plus one set of timber. Yes. Okay, so

10:43.557 --> 10:45.800
that was seven times 25. Pogo,

10:45.840 --> 10:50.346
Pogo.

10:53.296 --> 10:56.983
Who was your boss down in the mines? Mr. Lawrence. 
Mr. Lawrence? Lawrence. Did he go down in the mine?

11:01.691 --> 11:02.673
What was his name? I think he was Gus Lawrence. Gus 
Lawrence? Yeah. This Lawrence, he was the boss. He

11:09.745 --> 11:12.490
was the boss one time, you know. But then Willie 
Elson, his brother, named Frank Elson, he was the

11:12.510 --> 11:17.920
boss then. You know, he got maybe a little hole or 
something. He stayed on top. Okay. Was there any

11:24.475 --> 11:27.039
boss down below in the mines? Just one. Just one? 
Just one, yeah. And what was his function? What did

11:31.445 --> 11:42.161
he... Just look at the places, and when you break 
through from one place into another, he'd go ahead

11:31.445 --> 11:42.161
and mark you another place. Would he tell you 
where... not to go and where to go? No, he never said

11:47.209 --> 11:49.151
that. Was he concerned with the safety of the 
miners at all? Yeah. How would he be concerned with

11:54.317 --> 11:58.281
safety? Well, the safety was because, you see, 
there was not too many places in the coal mine caved

11:58.301 --> 12:08.353
in. That was the safety. I see. There were not very 
many caved in? No, no. Only when they pull the

12:15.967 --> 12:24.915
pillars, what they call the pillars, it's from one 
entry or room into another. And while the tunnel

12:26.076 --> 12:38.068
goes in, another tunnel back here, what they call 
pulling pillars, bring the whole thing, dig the

12:26.076 --> 12:38.068
whole thing out and set a bunch of props. I see. 
That's how come there's a lot of caves over there

12:38.228 --> 12:40.530
and holes. Have you noticed it, buddy? Well, them 
is why they pull the pillars out of the coal mine.

12:45.054 --> 12:45.855
They call them pillars. Well, they wouldn't pull 
the pillars out until they put the timber in.

12:49.847 --> 12:50.147
Right. They put the timber in. Yeah, as you pull, as 
you be digging, you set your property. And you

12:56.237 --> 13:04.910
could tell it about that far apart, you know, from 
the coal, about that far apart, three or four feet,

12:56.237 --> 13:04.910
you know, you put your property. I see. Okay. And 
they had a track man, too, in the coal mine. A track

13:10.278 --> 13:11.340
man. And what did he do? He laid a track for the coal 
miners. Do you remember how much he was paid? He was

13:17.021 --> 13:18.484
paid about $2 a day. $2 a day. Was there anybody that 
took care of the mules down there, a mule driver?

13:25.117 --> 13:25.277
No. Well, how did the mules pull the cars from the 
roof? We had to drive them. You had to drive the

13:31.428 --> 13:32.891
mules yourself. I see. We had a lamp cap and a lamp, a 
carbide lamp. The question was oil lamps. But then

13:39.042 --> 13:42.225
they got the carbide lamps along about 1912. About 
1912 is when the carbide lamps came in? Yeah. And

13:46.209 --> 14:04.266
then, you see, that gives you a lot of light to drive 
your mule with four, five cars, maybe six,

13:46.209 --> 14:04.266
according to how many places they go down a little 
or go up, you know? Ah, yeah, I see. And then that's

14:05.207 --> 14:06.628
all they could pull. So you filled up one car? And 
then hitched it onto a mule and took it to the cage.

14:11.596 --> 14:11.917
Yeah. And then your car went up the cage. And they 
had a place with some empty cars. Down underneath

14:18.524 --> 14:21.146
the mine? Yeah. Okay. All right. Now, how did you 
keep track of your cars? Well, they had a number,

14:24.590 --> 14:29.295
you see, where all the coal diggers had a number. 
They had a washer, you know? Brass washer? No, iron

14:33.519 --> 14:34.480
washer. Iron washer. But they had a stamp, you 
know. They had a... from one two three four five and

14:38.189 --> 15:07.572
your number was 12 or one or two whatever your 
number was then they find out that that's the way to

14:38.189 --> 15:07.572
find out how many cars of coal you dig a day I see you 
see on top of the temple there was a man dump the coal

14:38.189 --> 15:07.572
pull the the car out of the elevator and dump it and 
then when he dumps it he's down there and got got to

14:38.189 --> 15:07.572
check out and they had a a board with a lot of nails, 
and they put your watch in there, and it was your

15:07.957 --> 15:14.988
check number. There was no cars getting lost that 
way. No cars got lost? No. They never miscounted

15:19.394 --> 15:20.836
your cars? Oh, sure, they counted them right, too. 
That's good. Were you ever injured in the mines?

15:28.207 --> 15:28.428
Huh? Were you ever injured? Did you ever have an 
accident? No. Did any of your friends ever have an

15:31.632 --> 15:34.917
accident? No, not that I know of. Well, what about 
when one of your family was sick? How did you take

15:39.957 --> 15:40.958
care of them? Well, I'll tell you. When the family 
gets sick, now here's the way they had it. Each coal

15:46.665 --> 15:50.810
mine had maybe a doctor or two from town. And every 
person that was working in the coal mine, if he was

15:52.872 --> 16:03.124
single, he paid 25 cents every two weeks for the 
doctor to come and see him. And the married man,

16:04.437 --> 16:09.082
they had family that paid 50 cents every two weeks. 
And that's the way we had the doctor. Anytime we'd

16:12.026 --> 16:19.114
get sick, something happened to the family or the 
children, they called the doctor, the phone of the

16:12.026 --> 16:19.114
doctor, and he'd go over there. You didn't have to 
pay any extra? No, sir. We already was paying him 25

16:23.379 --> 16:32.049
cents, single man, every two weeks, and 50 cents a 
family man. When did you get married? I got married

16:34.728 --> 16:38.773
in 1914. 1914. And you got married at the mine site? 
Huh? Were you married at one of the mines? Or did you

16:46.142 --> 16:47.444
get married in town? No, I got married in town. I 
see. The guest of peace married me. His name was Ed

16:51.930 --> 16:53.191
Gunn. Ed Gunn? Ed Gunn. I think he died maybe two or 
three years ago. I see. Well, did you have a big

17:01.682 --> 17:03.644
party after you were married? No. Some of them had 
them, but some of them didn't. Well, but you took

17:13.528 --> 17:16.751
your wife back to the mine camp? Oh yeah, that's 
where we lived. You met her at the mines? Yeah, at

17:21.315 --> 17:23.878
the dances, that's where we met. At the dances, I 
see. Yeah, you see they had a big platform to give a

17:25.739 --> 17:29.583
dance. Which mine was this? Most of the coal mines 
had a platform. where they put up, where they

17:35.022 --> 17:39.768
celebrate the holidays. That is the 5th of May and 
the 16th of September. That's the holidays for the

17:43.733 --> 17:45.775
Mexican people. Well, did you meet your wife at the 
same camp where you were? Yeah. Okay. Back in 1914,

17:52.103 --> 17:56.669
do you remember which coal company you were 
working for? I was working for the Vogels. Vogels?

17:59.392 --> 17:59.533
Uh-huh. And which mine area was that? Was that the 
one we were looking at today? No. No, the one back in

18:04.891 --> 18:09.478
there, we didn't get to go to the coal mine. Over by 
the, near the brick factory? Yeah. That one? Okay.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.510
Did you ever sing when you were down in the mines? 
Huh? Did you ever sing songs while you were down in

18:18.091 --> 18:22.157
the mines? Oh, yeah. What kind of songs did you 
sing? Well, the same thing, you know, I'd sing,

18:23.579 --> 18:29.949
you'd sing by yourself, because you'd be in your 
own place. Can you remember one of those songs? You

18:32.532 --> 18:34.815
can't? No.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.606
Well, when you came out of the mines in the 
afternoon, what did you do? Took a bath. Took a

18:44.128 --> 18:45.069
bath. Took a bath, eat a little supper, and go play 
ballroom. Okay. Did each house have a bathtub? No,

18:51.758 --> 18:53.641
they were different. You see, we took a bath in that 
tub. And where? In one of the ordinary tubs.

19:00.515 --> 19:01.136
Ordinary tubs? Yeah, we didn't have no water out 
there. We paid 25 cents. At first we used to pay 25

19:06.428 --> 19:10.617
cents a barrel of water. 25 cents a barrel? Yeah. I 
see. And so you'd have several people... taking

19:17.639 --> 19:19.882
baths in one bathtub, right? Yeah, one, just one, 
each one in the house, because each family had a

19:19.902 --> 19:24.609
house. Each family had a house, and there was one 
tub per house. Yeah. Okay. And of course, we had to

19:28.134 --> 19:37.327
buy the tub, and not the same tub that we used, that 
the ladies used to wash the man's clothes and wash

19:28.134 --> 19:37.327
her clothes or the children's clothes. I see. Now, 
you understand that? Right, so you washed clothes

19:38.889 --> 19:43.015
and your body in the same bathtub. Okay. All right. 
You said you played ball after? Yeah, we'd get out

19:48.347 --> 19:50.230
and play ball too. Baseball? Yeah. What position 
did you play? Oh, I played first base, shortstop,

19:52.674 --> 19:57.523
center field. Did you have several teams per 
mining camp? Oh, just one, just one. Just one? Just

20:01.810 --> 20:03.133
one team, in fact. Of course, the other coal mines, 
they had the same team, and on the Sunday, well,

20:03.153 --> 20:08.161
that's what we do. We go up there and play ball. 
Either team goes to... Next coal mine or the island

20:11.167 --> 20:14.812
come and play with the rest of them. That's the way 
we played ball. I see. Did all the family come and

20:16.774 --> 20:19.498
watch? No. It was just for the men? Nothing but men, 
that's all. Family stayed in the island. We was

20:23.443 --> 20:24.845
funny, though. We all funny, though. It ain't like 
now, see? Now, a married man at that time, our wives

20:29.431 --> 20:37.522
stayed home. I see. Did you... Did you drink beer 
while you played ball? No.

20:45.300 --> 20:48.585
So you went dancing on Saturday night and played 
baseball on Sunday? Yeah. That's generally what

20:48.765 --> 20:50.368
happened? Sometimes, you know, we'd have a dance. 
Sometimes I'd go two, three weeks and all that.

20:59.081 --> 20:59.201
Nice. And when your wife had a baby, the doctor 
would come out from town? Yeah. Would he charge you

21:05.190 --> 21:06.452
any extra? No, sir. Did you get along with the 
Vogels and the Lawrences? Oh, yeah. You see, they

21:16.043 --> 21:19.407
stayed on their house. And it was different. They 
didn't go out and see the workmen or anything like

21:20.408 --> 21:25.294
that. They didn't risk nobody. They stayed right 
in their house and raised children. And your

21:31.801 --> 21:35.345
people stayed... Same way. Of course... And at 
that time, well, the neighbors, you know,

21:38.512 --> 21:43.458
sometimes they go and visit one each other. Not too 
much. Now you can't hardly keep a wife at home. I've

21:50.205 --> 21:51.487
been single 30 years. 30 years? Yes. Let me ask you 
something, Tomas. Did you vote ever in any of the

21:56.412 --> 21:59.295
Rockville elections? I only voted twice, that's 
all. When was that? That was last year. And...

22:10.490 --> 22:23.147
Do

22:10.490 --> 22:23.147
you remember World War I? Oh,

22:24.088 --> 22:36.885
yeah.

22:37.034 --> 22:39.177
How did it affect your life in the mines? Well, I'll 
tell you, I didn't go to the war because I had two

22:39.277 --> 22:43.223
children. In the First World War, I had a Noverta 
girl and a boy named Benino. He's in San Antonio.

22:53.238 --> 22:54.760
Now, I had them two children. That's the reason I 
didn't go to the war. I see. Well, did the mining

22:57.419 --> 23:00.543
pick up during the war? Yeah, yeah. Did you get paid 
any more money during the war? Well, we get a little

23:03.786 --> 23:11.455
more money and the workforce later stayed.

23:11.475 --> 23:14.839
What about, did the Ku Klux Klan ever come through 
this area? No. Not that I know. All right, all

23:17.102 --> 23:19.345
right. And you were telling me earlier that you 
left the Vogel mines in 1925? No, the Texas, I mean

23:27.085 --> 23:30.749
the Recluta, where we was. La Recluta. Yeah, La 
Recluta. When did you come to the La Recluta? Well,

23:35.774 --> 23:39.398
I came in there from Big Dump in 1924. I see. When did 
you leave the Vogel mine first? I left the Vogel

23:43.182 --> 23:52.892
coal mine in 1917, and I didn't come back until,

23:43.182 --> 23:52.892
no, 1916, I think it was. I didn't come back until 
19... 18, I think. What did you do for those two

23:58.634 --> 24:00.196
years? I went to pick cotton one year and then cut 
wood out in Christmas Texas. That's where my

24:04.541 --> 24:08.867
second child was born. When did you go to work for 
Big Lump? I went to work at Big Lump in 1900 and I

24:13.052 --> 24:19.560
guess 1980. 1919.

24:22.604 --> 24:23.185
I see. And you worked there until 1924? Yeah. When 
you went back to the La Recluta? La Recluta, yeah.

24:30.996 --> 24:31.096
Okay. Why did you leave the mines the first time? 
When I left, I went to work at another coal mine. I

24:38.086 --> 24:38.486
see. Why would you leave the first mine? Huh? Why 
would you leave the first mine? Well, I just feel

24:42.051 --> 24:44.174
like going to another place. Did they pay better 
over at the other place? No. Was there better

24:47.917 --> 24:49.639
living conditions, maybe? No, the same, but, you 
know, you get tired of staying in one place and you

24:49.659 --> 24:54.925
move to another place. I see. As long as you didn't 
owe the company nothing, you're free to go

24:55.926 --> 24:59.750
anywhere. Did you ever owe the company anything? 
No. You always kept clear credit. Yeah. Like I do

25:08.099 --> 25:09.380
here in Rockdale. I got credit at the state bank 
since 1922. I

25:13.165 --> 25:16.388
see. So every two weeks when you got paid, you 
always got a little bit of cash? Oh, yeah. I see.

25:30.100 --> 25:32.745
How did that depression affect you? Well... Did 
you quit the mines during the depression, or did

25:32.765 --> 25:35.910
you quit earlier? No.

25:38.995 --> 25:44.063
Let's see, when the depression time comes, I was 
19...

25:45.848 --> 25:57.421
Then

25:45.848 --> 25:57.421
I went to, in that same year, I went to pick cotton 
for a fellow by the name of Albert Tinneman. He

25:57.461 --> 25:59.403
lives up here on this street. Albert? Albert 
Tinneman. It's the German people. I see. Did you

26:07.132 --> 26:08.914
ever work for the Texas Coal Company? Yeah. You 
did? Do you remember what years? Well, it was 19, I

26:12.578 --> 26:17.445
think, the year that I worked for the Texas Gold 
Company. I think it was 1911. 1911.

26:24.214 --> 26:24.394
Yes. Was there ever a union movement in the mines? 
No. Do you know why there wasn't? No. Do you like

26:31.725 --> 26:33.067
unions? Well, I don't know nothing about the year. 
So the people... from up in the north. Yeah, they

26:39.902 --> 26:43.647
use a unit, but that's a hard coal, what you call it, 
stone coal. That's a hard coal. Now this coal and

26:45.610 --> 27:02.713
this lignite, you take it out today and let a lump 
that big, or as big as my head, let it lay out in the

26:45.610 --> 27:02.713
sun in two days, that's nothing but slack, what we 
call it. It breaks all the pieces. For rain, it

27:04.215 --> 27:06.278
breaks all the pieces. Did you ever use lignite for 
fuel? Yeah, in the house. In the house, you did?

27:14.335 --> 27:15.717
Yeah, for heating. Now, they didn't charge us for 
that. We'd go to the mine and get it out of the

27:18.000 --> 27:26.150
railroad cars and bring it home. They never did 
charge us for that. I see. What kind of materials

27:30.235 --> 27:33.519
did you get at the commissary? I mean, what? 
Grocers. Yeah. Well, just everything you, 10

27:36.218 --> 27:40.164
goods, all kinds, everything you wanted. And so 
on, they had bacon, lard, beans. And how would you

27:44.130 --> 27:46.333
purchase these, these goods? Well, they put it 
down in the book. Put it down in the book. Whatever

27:49.257 --> 27:55.907
you get, if you get two hours, the gross is 25 cents 
for this and 30 or 40 cents for this other. And it's

27:56.528 --> 27:58.210
all rolled down on the page. So when the week comes 
on the Friday, they figure out how much had you or

28:04.493 --> 28:07.476
taken out of the store, how much was you bought. And 
then payday next, and the Saturday was a payday,

28:08.177 --> 28:16.467
where they'll take it all, take all out of your 
wages. They said if you made $15, well, they'd take

28:17.207 --> 28:24.956
it out of the $15 if you only had $10 gross. That was 
according to the family what you had. Where'd you

28:29.301 --> 28:30.342
buy your clothes? Well, we'd come down and buy 
them. How did you get to town? Walk. You'd walk?

28:37.581 --> 28:37.681
Yeah. About how many miles was that? Oh, it was a 
while ago. About two, three miles, maybe four.

28:44.590 --> 28:44.690
Yeah. You told me earlier that you were able to 
purchase a Model T. Yeah. When did you do that? Oh,

28:53.221 --> 29:00.030
that was in 1900 and, let's see, about 1930. 
Because the Model T was a gift to me. It was given to

29:03.083 --> 29:04.324
you. Yeah, they gave it to a fella out in the 
country, here at the Whirly Mine. He had a model to

29:09.751 --> 29:15.518
you, and he didn't know how to fix it. So when I was at 
Big Lump, a fella by the name of Harry Steinberg, he

29:15.538 --> 29:27.192
was the pit boss of the mine at Big Lump. And many of 
them got along pretty good, and I was running some

29:27.212 --> 29:32.618
steam pumps to pump the water out of the coal mine. 
And they fixed the cars for the

29:33.728 --> 29:43.583
company. And that was Mr. Henemeyer was one of the 
owners, I think, and E.B. Phillips was the other

29:50.393 --> 29:54.820
owner. Now, didn't E.B. Phillips own the Texas 
mine, the Texas coal company? I think E.B.

30:02.031 --> 30:02.892
Phillips, I think. I think

30:03.850 --> 30:14.181
he had a part of the coal mine in Bigelow. And I think 
he did have part of Texas. I'm sorry, I interrupted

30:17.504 --> 30:18.586
you. Nate, you learned how to work on Model Ts? 
Yeah. Yeah, that's part of the law in me, you know. I

30:23.791 --> 30:25.012
have to get through puppet. I have to get through 
puppet while he says, Thomas, you want to learn how

30:26.714 --> 30:30.678
to fix this car? I said, yeah, glad to. So I'll tell 
you the truth. I learned how to fix a T-model, but I

30:34.928 --> 30:37.552
didn't run it. I was afraid I'd break it or do 
something to it, and I didn't run it. So he told me a

30:43.441 --> 30:44.262
way. He says, Thomas, you fix them, and I help you 
fix them, and we both work on it. He says, go ahead

30:50.911 --> 30:52.854
and dry one. If you break it, we'll fix it up again. 
So that's the way I learned how to fix a T-model

30:55.638 --> 31:01.887
before I could dry it. So when this man had this 
T-model, he didn't have no use for it. Well, he gave

31:05.807 --> 31:08.851
it to me. For no money? For no money. But in a good 
shape. But he is some man with, you know. Did you

31:16.281 --> 31:18.424
ever get around to driving it? Well, sure. I drove 
it from the Corpus Christi with all my family.

31:21.848 --> 31:22.710
Corpus Christi? Yeah. It's big cotton out there. 
Chopped cotton. What year? Yeah, vegetables.

31:27.376 --> 31:28.717
What year was that? Do you remember? 1924. 1924? 
Yes, sir. 1934. 1934. 1934.

31:39.478 --> 31:42.471
The interview is continued on the other side of the 
table.
