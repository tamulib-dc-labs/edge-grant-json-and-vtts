00:08.620 --> 00:12.924
Justice Serenello interview, November 11, 1985. 
All right, Lance,

00:12.945 --> 00:22.655
will you donate this to Texas A&M University? Is 
that OK? Yes. Thank you. Let me check.

00:33.506 --> 00:35.488
But I talked to Stephanie. I listened to her tape a 
couple of times, and I looked at her question, and

00:35.873 --> 00:42.460
so I want to try to take off what she talked about. 
She talked about some things that were pretty

00:42.760 --> 00:51.449
broad, and I want to try to get into detail on a 
couple of things. Sure. Plus ask some other

00:51.589 --> 00:52.190
questions. First off, just for general 
information, when and where were you born? I was

00:56.695 --> 01:01.780
born August 4th, 1948 in Brooklyn, New York. I 
understand you started school at City College in

01:02.266 --> 01:06.590
New York in 67. Yes. And you came to Southwest in the 
fall of 69. That's true. And then in the fall of 70,

01:12.475 --> 01:17.139
you went back to City College in New York. And you 
finished up there in June of 72. Yes. And when did

01:21.203 --> 01:23.205
you attend law school and where? I attended law 
school at the University of Texas at Austin from

01:23.305 --> 01:32.053
September of 73 until May of 76. OK.

01:35.971 --> 01:43.518
In the interview with Stephanie, you called the 
Vietnam War a great disaster for the American

01:35.971 --> 01:43.518
youth. When did your feelings against the war 
begin, and when did they intensify? The feelings

01:47.882 --> 01:55.950
against the war began, I would say, in 64, 65, when I 
was still in high school. And the reason I saw the

01:56.030 --> 02:01.855
war as not having any purpose It seemed like 
something that we were caught up in, but yet we're

02:02.307 --> 02:12.863
not able to advance any cause or help anyone, that 
we were really advancing our own interests in

02:02.307 --> 02:12.863
Southeast Asia. And I think as time went on, it 
became more apparent it was not the kind of war, a

02:15.226 --> 02:30.930
conventional war, that Americans were used to 
fighting, where we would go in and win in a few

02:15.226 --> 02:30.930
months or a year or so, and that we were becoming 
hopelessly mired in something that basically

02:32.007 --> 02:43.598
offered no expectation of a victory or something 
that was satisfying from the point of view of the

02:32.007 --> 02:43.598
American government. Well, apparently that's 
what made you speak out against the war. You

02:48.303 --> 02:54.329
mentioned in the other interview that you were 
taught to question in high school. Do you think

02:54.349 --> 02:56.371
that was part of it? Also, I take it your parents, 
from what I understand in the interview, pretty

03:01.572 --> 03:04.155
much conform to the authority. Right. They were 
basically very authoritarian minded. They never

03:07.800 --> 03:14.428
thought of questioning authority or they 
basically believed in following whatever the

03:07.800 --> 03:14.428
government policies were. And I think in high 
school, I learned more about just questioning,

03:15.169 --> 03:22.458
not accepting, and beginning to ask, why are we in 
this war? What have we got to gain? What is our

03:23.659 --> 03:25.742
purpose? And the more you ask those questions, I 
think it became apparent that we really didn't

03:29.787 --> 03:37.718
have a solid purpose in being there, and that the 
government kept expanding our involvement. And

03:37.738 --> 03:44.527
of course, I began to be of draft age and began to be 
thinking as well from my own standpoint. I think a

03:44.547 --> 03:50.014
lot of other people my age were thinking, well, we 
might go over there and get killed. And what are we

03:50.114 --> 03:52.758
doing it for? And many of us thought, this is not 
right. There wasn't any purpose. At that point, I

03:59.116 --> 04:07.689
remembered my history courses about World War II 
and thought about what American youth were like in

03:59.116 --> 04:07.689
the early 40s. And to me, there seemed to be a 
distinct difference between then fighting

04:07.709 --> 04:21.850
someone who had the potential of threatening our 
freedom as opposed to what had we to fear from the

04:07.709 --> 04:21.850
government of South Vietnam or North Vietnam? 
What had the Americans had to fear? Surely, they

04:24.454 --> 04:26.136
were not going to get in the boats come across to the 
West Coast or get in planes. I mean, and things like

04:29.617 --> 04:35.963
that, which at this point seem rather simple or 
rather straightforward. Yet at that time, most

04:35.983 --> 04:43.049
people were just unquestioned support of Vietnam 
or the government. What kind of an upbringing did

04:44.351 --> 04:46.593
you have? Did your parents punish you in any way 
when you didn't go by what they said and you

04:47.594 --> 04:53.119
questioned? Yeah, punishment was usually 
corporal by spanking or slapping or taking away

04:53.285 --> 05:00.738
privileges or things like that. I grew up in a 
tenement in Brooklyn in the early 50s. So, I mean,

05:05.105 --> 05:08.351
we were basically, by most standards, poor. And 
there wasn't a whole lot they could take away, but

05:08.371 --> 05:14.100
basically time to spend on the street playing. 
What is your religion? I'm Catholic. You are

05:17.586 --> 05:18.528
Catholic. Right. Also, from the high school, was 
it because of your teachers, or was it because of

05:19.643 --> 05:25.750
your peers where you were cross-questioned? I 
think it was a combination of teachers and peers.

05:27.872 --> 05:31.737
The high school I went to required an entrance exam 
in New York City. It was one of three high schools

05:31.757 --> 05:36.222
that you had to take an entrance exam to get into. 
And generally, it was nearly everyone there went

05:37.143 --> 05:44.191
on to college, and it was different from the 
neighborhood high schools. Was it a private

05:44.211 --> 05:45.332
school? No, it was a public school. Public? 
Mm-hmm. But that was the only requirement Was it

05:49.765 --> 05:51.587
close to your home? No, it was not. It was about an 
hour subway ride from my home. The reason I went

05:55.491 --> 06:02.739
there was because it was a very good high school.

06:02.759 --> 06:18.355
Do you think some of the students that protested 
the war, especially say in 69 when you were leading

06:02.759 --> 06:18.355
a lot of them, do you think they did it because it was 
bashing, they were just following the crowd, pick

06:02.759 --> 06:18.355
up a chick, you know, I'm protesting, we'll get 
some drugs, or do you think some of them sincerely

06:18.757 --> 06:24.445
had reservations about the war and wanted to do 
something about it? I think it's a combination. I

06:26.108 --> 06:32.497
think there were certainly some people who were in 
it because it was a fad or it was the cheap thing to do

06:26.108 --> 06:32.497
at that time. But I think most people had genuine 
reservations about the war and what was

06:33.318 --> 06:37.985
happening. And people at that point in 69 knew of, 
had friends who had either died in Vietnam or

06:38.526 --> 06:44.815
injured in Vietnam, And in fact, one of the people 
that I was kicked out of school with had been

06:45.402 --> 06:50.169
Vietnam. And at that point in 69, you had a lot of 
Vietnam veterans speaking out against the war.

06:55.517 --> 07:00.884
And on the campus of Southwest, there were a number 
of veterans who spoke out against it. And I think it

07:01.826 --> 07:10.879
was more than just because it was fashionable, 
although at this point in 69, demonstrations had

07:01.826 --> 07:10.879
become somewhat fashionable. However, in 
Southwest Texas State, they were not. The

07:15.085 --> 07:24.319
demonstration that we had in October of 69 was the 
first anti-war demonstration they ever had in

07:15.085 --> 07:24.319
that town or that county. So on the 15th in 
conjunction with Vietnam War? That's right. And

07:29.586 --> 07:35.015
then the second one was in November when we were 
suspended. I'll get more into that. You mentioned

07:37.258 --> 07:42.105
in the other interview also that maybe 10% of the 
students at any one time participated in

07:42.507 --> 07:45.431
demonstrations. And so looking back, do you think 
that was a good percentage, a good turnout? Or do

07:50.677 --> 07:52.739
you think it could have done better? We thought it 
was a good turnout then, because initially there

07:52.759 --> 07:57.185
was very little support. And in the October 
moratorium, there was a fair number of students

07:57.285 --> 08:03.292
more than we had expected. And in November, it had 
grown. And we thought that the turnout was

08:07.537 --> 08:11.282
improving. you'd like to have had 100%. You don't 
expect that. And at that point, given what was

08:14.746 --> 08:23.819
going on in many campuses of the size and 
temperament of San Marcos, I thought that was a

08:14.746 --> 08:23.819
good turnout. And we certainly, in October, the 
auditorium that we had for our speakers was

08:23.839 --> 08:32.972
completely overflowing with people. In fact, 
there were speakers outside for the people who

08:32.992 --> 08:38.139
were sitting outside. Good job.

08:42.481 --> 08:48.728
You said you were aware of your involvement, your 
interest began in 64, 65. Was it just from watching

08:48.949 --> 08:50.771
television? Were you aware of specific events, 
such as, well, a couple instances that I noticed

08:50.791 --> 09:09.012
doing research that were very important, such as 
the spring mobilization and the war in April of 67,

08:50.791 --> 09:09.012
the Rolling Thunder in 68, which started in 64 but 
lasted until 68, which was just constant bombing

09:10.139 --> 09:13.103
of North Vietnam by the American troops. Were 
there particular instances that you could

09:13.424 --> 09:17.931
isolate on? Well, I would say that a number of our 
professors in high school or teachers encouraged

09:18.992 --> 09:27.364
us to think about the war, about what was going on. 
And I can't pinpoint any one thing, but I think it

09:28.646 --> 09:39.943
was certainly some of the speakers that we had in 
high school also encouraged us to think about the

09:28.646 --> 09:39.943
war. Our valedictory speech in high school, the 
valedictorian basically gave an anti-war

09:40.885 --> 09:45.671
speech. And it just seemed that it was very 
frequent in conversation, not just on

09:46.572 --> 09:57.825
television, because television at that time, in 
64, 65, was basically pro-administration. I

09:58.045 --> 10:09.539
mean, there was some questioning of it, and there 
was not a lot of any more sentiment, although there

09:58.045 --> 10:09.539
was a fair amount growing in New York and some of the 
major eastern cities. But it was still...

10:11.277 --> 10:18.363
considered still very anti-government, 
un-American, to have been against the war at that

10:11.277 --> 10:18.363
time. How involved were you in your first two years 
at City College? I was involved in some

10:21.867 --> 10:31.495
demonstrations and some planning of 
demonstrations with the committees up there and

10:21.867 --> 10:31.495
the anti-war groups up there. But it was basically 
a loose amalgam of organizations and activities.

10:35.439 --> 10:38.922
It was not well organized.

10:40.150 --> 10:44.737
Reading the article, it said that you liked the 
Kentucky Hill Country and such. Is that all that

10:44.757 --> 10:47.722
enticed you to transfer down to Santa Barbara? 
That's right. One of my hobbies at that time was

10:49.224 --> 10:51.387
skydiving. It still is. And I took a couple of weeks 
in summer in college and just went around the

10:52.068 --> 10:58.218
country skydiving. And St. Marcus had a nice gym 
center. I thought the Hill Country was pretty, and

11:00.501 --> 11:02.985
I decided to. I wanted to go just to a different kind 
of school and pick Southwest Texas State. And

11:09.635 --> 11:16.787
Texas at that time was inexpensive for 
out-of-state students, and that was another

11:09.635 --> 11:16.787
factor. Going down there then and starting your 
junior year, did you expect or did you anticipate

11:16.807 --> 11:24.020
what you were going to get involved in? No, I did not 
expect that I would get. I thought I would be

11:27.181 --> 11:29.584
involved in some anti-war activities. I assumed 
that there would be some kind of existing ongoing

11:29.644 --> 11:35.992
organization on campus and that I would 
participate. But when I got there, I found out that

11:36.052 --> 11:39.937
there really wasn't any such an entity. And 
therefore, I proceeded to try and work with some

11:40.477 --> 11:49.408
other people to try and get some anti-war activity 
going, at least some mobilization and some effort

11:40.477 --> 11:49.408
to express our feelings against the war. And this 
is when you met in the coffee house and started the

11:51.024 --> 11:55.389
ad hoc committee? That's right. Was that solely 
your responsibility? Did you dream that up, or did

11:58.133 --> 12:03.059
you run into these other eight individuals? Was it 
all of your own meaning? I think it was a matter of

12:05.142 --> 12:08.927
just, I wouldn't say it was solely my idea. It was 
just something that we more or less decided to do

12:08.987 --> 12:18.619
and form to get some organized activity against 
the war on campus. These other eight, were they all

12:19.122 --> 12:20.824
gentlemen? Were they all men? No. See, there were 
three women and seven males. And actually,

12:28.095 --> 12:35.386
several of them were not involved in the anti-war 
activities really until that demonstration in

12:28.095 --> 12:35.386
November. And of course, there were a lot of people 
at the demonstration site. And once the

12:41.915 --> 12:48.184
university came and roped off the area and said, 
you've got three minutes to vacate, then many

12:49.548 --> 12:50.729
people left. And it was just the 10 of us that 
stayed. I don't know if you were aware of that.

12:58.316 --> 13:08.304
Essentially, the way it happened is that we had 
negotiated with the administration for a space on

12:58.316 --> 13:08.304
the campus to have a demonstration. And at that 
point, the administration said, no, we're not

13:09.025 --> 13:18.373
going to let you have anything outside except in 
what was called at that time the free speech area,

13:09.025 --> 13:18.373
which was an area not centrally located on campus, 
and you could only demonstrate for one hour. We had

13:22.739 --> 13:24.682
the exact same thing. Do you? Okay. Well, we 
consulted with some attorneys in Austin through

13:25.883 --> 13:30.149
the American Civil Liberties Union. They advised 
us that, in their opinion, they didn't think that

13:30.990 --> 13:41.303
was constitutional, that we had a right to express 
ourselves, you know, as long as we were not

13:30.990 --> 13:41.303
obstructing traffic and not disturbing classes. 
And so we then proceeded to hold the demonstration

13:42.345 --> 13:47.972
on a grassy area and not make any noise. The 
administration came down, roped off the area, and

13:48.931 --> 13:55.938
said, you've got three minutes to leave or you'll 
be suspended. And 10 of us stayed. And then they

13:58.861 --> 14:00.483
suspended us. I mean, there were TV cameras there. 
It was on the news that night. It was apparently. So

14:06.629 --> 14:08.291
immediately you were suspended. And when was it 
that the circuit judge? What happened was we were

14:12.175 --> 14:16.500
suspended on November 9, or whenever it happened, 
November. Was that November? Was it the 15th? Was

14:19.403 --> 14:20.786
it the second moratorium? It was the second 
moratorium, whatever that was. Maybe it was the

14:22.728 --> 14:24.010
15th. In November, and then we were reinstated 
about three weeks later by the Fifth Circuit Court

14:24.912 --> 14:30.019
of Appeals. Judge Roberts in Austin denied our 
request for reinstatement. The Fifth Circuit

14:34.967 --> 14:43.219
granted our request, and therefore we were 
allowed to continue in school until the end of the

14:34.967 --> 14:43.219
school year. However, We were not granted any 
credit. The university would not give us credit

14:47.408 --> 14:54.119
until, you know, the issue was finally resolved on 
the merits. And we lost on the merits. To the

14:57.825 --> 15:00.649
Supreme Court in 72. What did you do those three 
weeks that you were suspended? Were you still... I

15:04.475 --> 15:09.223
was still involved in some anti-war activities or 
just mobilizing, you know. There were some other

15:09.243 --> 15:10.585
demonstrations. We had demonstrations about 
people trying to convince the administration to

15:12.715 --> 15:15.538
put us back in school. In fact, the night we got 
suspended, there were probably as many as 3,000

15:16.219 --> 15:24.408
students that attended the demonstration. And 
many students, even those who were not against the

15:25.449 --> 15:31.295
war, just felt like that was just excessive. It was 
just unfair to throw us out of school for what we

15:31.315 --> 15:37.322
did.

15:37.876 --> 15:44.243
I take it when you were suspended, and then when you 
were reinstated into school, it was about finals

15:37.876 --> 15:44.243
time, then, wasn't it? Mm-hmm. Did you come back in 
the spring semester? Yes, I did. But all this time,

15:48.408 --> 15:55.476
even though the spring semester, all the time you 
were taking classes, those credits, too, were

15:48.408 --> 15:55.476
questionable. Right. Because the suspension 
from the university was for one academic year.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.481
Okay. And so, therefore, the university allowed 
us to attend school. It would not produce any

16:05.147 --> 16:06.448
credits. And so my transcript just reads one 
paragraph from the Southwest Texas statement. It

16:12.628 --> 16:18.032
cites the case and says that all credits denied.

16:19.674 --> 16:26.319
And then after that, that's when we went back to 
Citadel. What kind of a communication network did

16:26.339 --> 16:32.164
you have going to reach your supporters? It was a 
combination of telephones. We had a telephone

16:34.406 --> 16:36.688
bank of people. We also had one person in each dorm 
that was responsible for motivating or getting

16:37.613 --> 16:48.530
people out or letting people know what was 
happening. We had people in various parts of the

16:48.610 --> 16:58.045
student community that lived in the town that 
would basically be assigned to different areas.

16:58.065 --> 17:03.013
And we then used notices that we would put around. 
Such as flyers? Flyers, right. Where did you get

17:05.787 --> 17:07.629
the funding for things like that? The owner of one 
of the bookstores, Bob Barton,

17:08.169 --> 17:18.099
was a legislator up until two years ago. He had been 
a newspaperman in San Marcos. He supported us with

17:22.303 --> 17:30.030
funding, donated money, and donated some 
printing press materials. And you also had a

17:30.702 --> 17:33.366
couple underground papers. That's right. We had 
the Purgatory Creek Press. And there was the

17:35.709 --> 17:37.611
Weather Report. Weather Report, that was it. Your 
group and the organizers, were they in charge of

17:40.555 --> 17:44.701
that, or just someone else? The Weather Report was 
done by someone else, and the Purgatory Creek

17:44.921 --> 17:51.490
Press was also done by some other people. In fact, a 
journalism student who'd been removed off the

17:51.530 --> 18:00.422
newspaper

17:51.530 --> 18:00.422
was in charge of the Purgatory Creek Press. And 
he's now, or was at one time, a city councilman in

18:02.781 --> 18:07.328
St. Lawrence. And those publications, what would 
be printed in those? They were mainly articles

18:11.394 --> 18:19.986
about the warm Vietnam or about issues on the 
campus regarding students or women. Women's

18:20.827 --> 18:24.893
rights at that point was sort of an emerging issue.

18:27.056 --> 18:27.557
I wish I I'm sure I've got copies of them somewhere, 
they're just difficult

18:27.892 --> 18:34.500
to locate. But they were pretty, in terms of the 
reporting in the articles, they were not unbiased

18:34.580 --> 18:42.230
by any means. They were quite slanted. And there 
was a lot of hype and a lot of rhetoric. Did you all

18:48.598 --> 18:49.819
ever read E.T.' 's Frag? Yeah. And did you have any 
communication going with Moe or SNC? We did, and we

18:56.056 --> 19:02.323
got some of the national and regional flyers and 
brochures that were printed and put out. How would

19:02.343 --> 19:04.346
you obtain that information? Did you contact them 
and they'd mail it to you? We were in contact with

19:06.788 --> 19:15.859
the Austin SMC office and then the Washington 
office, but mainly through the Austin office. And

19:15.879 --> 19:19.904
with your group, was there one person who was more 
or less the president, the leader? Not really,

19:21.285 --> 19:22.907
although, I mean, I didn't, you know, informally, 
you know, attributed to being the leader. But I

19:26.345 --> 19:32.374
think we all, you know, we all had, we were all quite 
strong individuals. And it wasn't the kind of

19:32.394 --> 19:38.183
group where nine of you followed one person and we 
all had our own ideas. You know, and it was somewhat

19:39.184 --> 19:41.207
diverse. We weren't monolithic in terms of our 
viewpoint or outlook by any means. And I would say

19:46.215 --> 19:50.481
that, you know, we were a, a loosely banded 
together group of people, and there wasn't any one

19:51.457 --> 19:56.562
particular leader. Although, again, I've been 
attributed to that, to being the leader, or been

19:57.082 --> 20:09.975
referred to as that, but I think everyone had 
different ideas, and everyone had some important

19:57.082 --> 20:09.975
ideas.

20:09.995 --> 20:15.100
When did, going back to the Ad Hoc Committee, when 
exactly did that start? Was it right at the

20:15.120 --> 20:16.982
beginning of the... It was right at the beginning. 
I'd say about Oh, the first week of September we

20:21.258 --> 20:24.002
removed it. And were your main efforts in to get 
ready for the first moratorium? Because the first

20:30.010 --> 20:36.079
moratorium was coming about, and the idea was to 
have some sort of campus-wide activity. And at

20:37.321 --> 20:41.387
first the administration was very reluctant, but 
they agreed to do it. And it was only after they got

20:42.448 --> 20:49.999
all this negative response from people in the 
community, alumni, whatever, that they really

20:42.448 --> 20:49.999
tried to come down on us on the second one. What 
happened with that first one? What did you do

20:53.319 --> 20:55.282
exactly? We had Senator Schwartz at that time, I 
believe. Well, we had some professors speak about

21:00.790 --> 21:07.561
the war in Vietnam. And again, it was the 
auditorium that we had was just overflowing with

21:08.943 --> 21:15.212
people. That's where you had him? And that's all it 
entailed, were speakers at the auditorium, no

21:16.237 --> 21:20.621
marches, no sittings?

21:23.264 --> 21:28.149
We had a short march, but it was not very lengthy. 
But that was the extent. And we handed out flyers

21:29.310 --> 21:40.421
and brochures, trying to encourage other people 
to think about the war more.

21:41.122 --> 21:45.366
When this was starting and you were getting 
involved in 69, were you even up with the other

21:46.240 --> 21:49.464
campuses across the country and what they were 
doing? We were only mainly through the newspaper

21:49.484 --> 21:58.195
and then through the, we'd occasionally attend 
some regional meetings in Austin about what was

21:49.484 --> 21:58.195
going on. But that was pretty much the extent of it. 
You had the two moratoriums. Is there any other

22:05.364 --> 22:11.611
demonstrations that you're involved in at 
Southwest during your stay? There, I believe in

22:12.633 --> 22:15.336
February we had another anti-war activity, 
which, according to our, you know, basically

22:16.143 --> 22:25.996
following the advice of our lawyers, we just 
strictly followed the administration's

22:16.143 --> 22:25.996
guidelines about the demonstration. We had a 
demonstration in response to Kent State. That was

22:29.500 --> 22:30.301
the vigil. The vigil, right. And then we also had a 
demonstration regarding a foreign student that

22:32.184 --> 22:43.298
the university was apparently trying to punish 
for his political ideas.

22:44.257 --> 22:49.102
I learned later, we had a march on the 
administration building to the dean's office.

22:49.122 --> 22:52.365
And I later learned that the dean thought we were 
going to try and destroy records. And they hoarded

22:52.385 --> 22:55.968
everything, all these safes closed or vaults 
closed. It was just amazing. But we just marched to

22:57.549 --> 23:05.377
the dean's office to talk to the dean about what was 
happening to the students. So there were never any

23:05.397 --> 23:12.123
draft card burnings, sit-ins, anything that was a 
little more radical than just? No, nothing. more

23:14.277 --> 23:18.823
radical, nothing where the wall was broken or 
anything like that. That did not happen. And

23:21.367 --> 23:32.502
basically, we thought that would not be a good step 
to take, especially in light of the fact that we

23:21.367 --> 23:32.502
were already involved in this litigation over the 
suspension in November. I mean, it's quite

23:32.522 --> 23:39.852
possible that if nothing had happened in 
November, that we might have gone further and done

23:32.522 --> 23:39.852
more, and there might have been some sit-ins. I 
don't know whether there would have been draft

23:40.433 --> 23:43.677
card burnings, but there might have been some 
sit-ins. or something around that. But I think

23:46.491 --> 23:51.097
there was an attempt, really, to try and stay 
within the law. I just thought we had the upper hand

23:53.500 --> 24:01.591
that way in trying not to do something that could 
provoke the administration or give them grounds.

24:01.611 --> 24:04.654
I mean, we were never arrested at the 
demonstration. It was strictly a civil matter.

24:06.377 --> 24:09.100
Never any arrests during the protests? No. Never 
any arrests. It was closely monitored by the

24:11.703 --> 24:14.507
police, but we never Well, what was the 
administration's reason for asking you to leave?

24:20.735 --> 24:26.023
They said that the demonstration was disrupting 
the campus. And here we were being punished

24:27.304 --> 24:35.997
because there were lots of people hollering and 
yelling at us, you know, commies, you know, Yankee

24:27.304 --> 24:35.997
agitator, and that sort of thing. And I assume it 
probably was disruptive to certain classrooms,

24:36.958 --> 24:41.845
but it wasn't us It was causing the disruption. We 
were not saying anything. We were not blocking any

24:45.479 --> 24:47.541
paths. But that was the administration's 
reasoning. In fact, they had several professors

24:49.964 --> 24:56.712
testify at the trial that their classrooms were 
being disrupted by the noise. Of course, the

24:57.693 --> 25:02.358
professors couldn't testify as to who was making 
the noise because they didn't see it. But we had

25:02.378 --> 25:09.807
testimony about who was making the noise and that 
nothing was done to stop people who were making the

25:02.378 --> 25:09.807
noise or disperse the crowd that was gathering. 
So, I mean, from that standpoint, it's fairly

25:13.499 --> 25:17.864
ludicrous to blame us for disrupting. I mean, we 
were sitting on a grass knoll, just ten of us. I

25:21.067 --> 25:26.793
mean, yeah, it's absurd at this point, but that's 
the way the administration viewed it. And, of

25:27.374 --> 25:32.059
course, they had Jack Roberts, who was the 
district judge that heard the case at that time. He

25:32.159 --> 25:36.263
was an LBJ appointee. After, you know, one minute, 
of the case closing, he rendered a decision

25:39.402 --> 25:43.948
against us. And it was just, pardon me, I mean, 
you're taking it under your belt. So you think that

25:47.613 --> 25:50.237
his decision was a little far? Yeah, his decision 
was made up before he ever heard the avenues, I'm

25:50.437 --> 25:54.703
sure. But, you know, we did not win the Fifth 
Circuit on the trial of the merits. And when it went

26:01.191 --> 26:09.122
up to the Supreme Court and lost at that point, so 
sure it was denied. You know, the way the facts come

26:09.878 --> 26:15.086
out in the case, and what I might try to do is get you a 
copy of the opinion. It appears that we were not

26:15.647 --> 26:19.532
being reasonable in our negotiations with the 
administration. So there are some facts that

26:19.572 --> 26:22.276
don't come out clearly. But we were trying to 
negotiate. The administration just did not view

26:24.840 --> 26:29.267
this as an embarrassment. It viewed the fact that 
we, because a lot of the other schools in Texas on

26:29.287 --> 26:37.439
the level of Southwest Texas State were not having 
any demonstrations. And it was an embarrassment

26:37.459 --> 26:39.582
to this administration their students were 
protesting and demonstrating. The view was,

26:42.210 --> 26:45.594
can't you, the administrators, stop these 
people? Can't you do something to sweep them under

26:45.614 --> 26:48.377
the rug? And so they were very upset. They were 
determined to keep us from having a large

26:51.081 --> 26:57.769
demonstration like we had in October. These 
people that were yelling at you and such, were they

26:57.789 --> 27:04.297
people from the community, other students? There 
were other students, mainly cowboys, people who

27:04.458 --> 27:08.843
just them raised in Texas with old backgrounds. 
Did you ever get into any type of debates with, just

27:13.309 --> 27:29.196
verbal debates back and forth and ask them why they 
were... We had some verbal discussions, although

27:13.309 --> 27:29.196
not, that day we had some, but it was mainly some 
discussion, but it never really got anywhere. I

27:29.216 --> 27:34.324
mean, there was some communication, but a lot of 
them were fairly hostile. They saw this as the

27:34.996 --> 27:41.385
Communist menace that they mourned about in 
Sunday school and grammar school. I just felt like

27:41.946 --> 27:44.830
I'd been cast back several years. It was amazing. 
Were they all so primitive? Yes, they were

27:47.634 --> 27:53.482
primitive in terms of their politics and 
ideology. They were very dogmatic. It was just

27:55.886 --> 27:59.892
incredible.

28:00.272 --> 28:04.378
Over the course of the year, there was some 
discussion.

28:04.679 --> 28:08.564
the events of that year, the demonstrations, 
provoked a lot of class discussion. And, you know,

28:09.765 --> 28:14.891
I think people had a more open view of that. But 
that's... I mean, there was some discussion.

28:22.139 --> 28:25.203
What do you think it is that drives people to 
protest? What is it just... Well, it's a

28:26.284 --> 28:29.968
combination of things. I think one is just the 
sense of morality of what's right and what's

28:34.278 --> 28:36.401
wrong. That if the government is doing something 
that's wrong, you as a citizen of that government

28:36.521 --> 28:43.330
have an obligation to speak out against it. I think 
that's one area. There's also, you know, where you

28:48.657 --> 28:54.004
are directly involved, you know, where you're 
likely to be drafted. That's a motivation,

28:54.025 --> 28:58.390
particularly in regard to the Vietnam War. You 
have a lot of different people. And there's also

29:02.273 --> 29:04.056
Demonstrations were fashionable. It was the 
wartime war. People meet each other, smoke a

29:05.859 --> 29:09.685
little dope. And that took place, too. And that was 
part of it all. They certainly didn't smoke dope at

29:12.389 --> 29:15.714
demonstrations in southwest Texas. But that was 
part of it, too. It's a combination of motives. But

29:22.445 --> 29:28.855
I think that the morality of the war and the draft 
were probably two main things. Which one do you

29:29.830 --> 29:34.697
think was stronger, the fear of the draft or the 
disagreement with government policy?

29:34.717 --> 29:38.523
Unfortunately, I think the fear of the draft was 
probably stronger. Although I would say many

29:39.504 --> 29:51.222
people, the disagreement with government policy 
was strong, but you had many people who, once the

29:39.504 --> 29:51.222
draft was no longer a problem.

29:54.787 --> 29:56.209
Let me rephrase that. People were not as concerned 
about what was going on with the government in 72,

29:56.864 --> 30:06.797
73, when I went back to Southwest Texas, when 
students could then vote. I mean, they literally

30:06.817 --> 30:12.864
could control that city, and yet they chose not to. 
It just shocked me. And students, a lot of them were

30:16.890 --> 30:22.737
voting Republican in 72. It was a disillusion 
because they just did not have a real concern about

30:23.290 --> 30:28.959
what their government was doing. The draft wasn't 
as big a problem and they just sort of backed off.

30:33.205 --> 30:36.390
What was the draft age at that time? It was 18. And 
voting and drinking age is 21. Correct. In Texas,

30:41.137 --> 30:42.599
right. How did you feel about that when they were 
asking you to dock your country at 18 and yet you

30:42.619 --> 30:50.952
couldn't speak with your vote for... Well, I 
thought it was, of course, at that time, I had just

30:51.522 --> 30:55.306
turned 21, so I could drink. But I still thought it 
was inconsistent. I thought you shouldn't be in a

30:58.009 --> 31:03.576
position where you can be called upon to fight for 
your country, and you couldn't get a drink. Yeah, I

31:04.437 --> 31:05.978
thought that was outrageous.

31:08.461 --> 31:12.806
But you had a lot of people who were students, I 
think, who were concerned about the draft. But

31:13.146 --> 31:16.590
there was also this outrage about the war. Because 
you also, as I say, by 69, And people had been seeing

31:19.720 --> 31:24.926
it on television, had been watching the weekly 
death counts. And people began asking

31:25.868 --> 31:29.252
themselves, is this right? And I think that the 
demonstrations were a catalyst that people

31:29.953 --> 31:42.448
really began to articulate, or at least in their 
own minds began to formulate that something was

31:29.953 --> 31:42.448
not right. What was it that made you different from 
everybody else that made you one of the leaders?

31:49.471 --> 31:58.460
Well, I think part of it was a willingness to get 
something going, to start an activity where there

31:49.471 --> 31:58.460
was not an activity there. I guess it's just my own, 
I was not willing to accept that there was not going

31:59.100 --> 32:10.591
to be some activity or organization to mobilize 
against the war in southwest Texas State.

32:13.173 --> 32:16.376
I learned to question authority and not just 
accept things. And it was an area where there was a

32:16.397 --> 32:19.039
need for someone I mean, if there had been an 
ongoing campus activity organization, I

32:19.964 --> 32:29.497
probably would have participated, but would not 
have assumed the role that I did. I think there was a

32:29.517 --> 32:43.876
need, and there was a role available, and I wanted 
to fulfill that role because someone needed

32:29.517 --> 32:43.876
to do it. I understand. OK. Other such actions, 
especially reading out to get involved in the 69,

32:50.288 --> 32:57.056
the Tet Offensive, the arrests in Chicago, and 
things like that. Did those inspire you even more

32:57.076 --> 33:02.222
to voice your opinions to try to get something 
better? I think they did. I think that there was a

33:02.922 --> 33:06.186
feeling that the government was lying to us. The 
government was really trying to clamp down any

33:06.206 --> 33:12.854
kind of expression. And it made us very angry, 
because we grew up thinking how wonderful the

33:12.874 --> 33:19.401
government was. What a great country we've got, or 
as you're told by your teachers, and that just

33:19.803 --> 33:24.007
wasn't so. And you saw the extent to which the 
government would go to try and suppress opinions

33:24.827 --> 33:34.335
that were not in line with what the government 
wanted to hear decisively articulate. Along that

33:36.017 --> 33:46.386
line, Nixon

33:36.017 --> 33:46.386
had his speech, November 3, 1969, to attack the 
Trump 42nd. Do you hear that speech? Yes. said that

33:49.570 --> 33:59.722
the enemy was at home, and he was making 
accusations against all the students,

33:49.570 --> 33:59.722
especially the students, and their protests and 
stuff. How did you feel about that when he said

33:59.742 --> 34:01.544
that? That made me even more angry, because I was 
doing what I considered my right as an American,

34:01.564 --> 34:14.258
which was to express my opinion, speak out, 
exercise my free speech. And there was a president

34:15.379 --> 34:17.822
saying, You don't have the right to do that, or I 
don't want you doing that, because that speech

34:18.359 --> 34:24.145
doesn't agree with what I think your opinion ought 
to be. And that was the very kind of attitude that I

34:24.686 --> 34:31.353
can only remember being told was the communist 
countries, where they wouldn't let you speak out.

34:31.373 --> 34:38.381
You had to always speak in favor of the government, 
or whatever government line was being hoisted at

34:31.373 --> 34:38.381
that point. So that was very upsetting. How did you 
feel then about the silent majority and all the

34:40.624 --> 34:46.490
others that conformed to the government? What 
were your thoughts? feelings towards those

34:47.452 --> 34:49.154
people? Well, my feelings were one of basically 
anger and frustration that people would allow

34:49.174 --> 35:04.390
themselves to be cowed into a way of thinking just 
because the president or the government was

34:49.174 --> 35:04.390
telling them, this is the way you should think. 
This is the patriotic approach. And if you're a

35:06.853 --> 35:08.695
patriot, you will do this. It was this blind 
obedience to a line of policy that people were not

35:08.715 --> 35:14.682
questioning. And that was upsetting. I thought 
the greatest thing about this country was that you

35:16.460 --> 35:21.126
could question, you could speak out. And that 
people would, if they had some questions, or would

35:21.146 --> 35:27.134
challenge the government. But here, people were 
unwilling to do this. There was a real climate of

35:29.598 --> 35:32.382
fear. People were afraid about jobs, about if they 
spoke out, if they were perceived as dissidents.

35:38.790 --> 35:41.754
And I think that was particularly so in 65, 66, and 
so on. Do you think this was a result of the the

35:45.873 --> 35:52.301
silent generation in the 50s and the conformity 
during that period and the anti-communism

35:45.873 --> 35:52.301
campaign. Yeah, I think Nixon effectively tried 
to, and LBJ also, to evoke memories of McCarthy

35:52.522 --> 36:10.145
when we were trying to keep the commies out, that 
people who disagreed with the government policy

35:52.522 --> 36:10.145
were communists, that you could not be a patriot 
and disagree with government policy. I mean, that

36:10.305 --> 36:15.171
was what they tried to promulgate as basically an 
ideology that if you were a patriot, if you loved

36:15.556 --> 36:24.769
this country, you had to support whatever the 
government did. And that was very frightening,

36:24.829 --> 36:29.356
because there were a lot of people who fought that. 
And in many parts of this country at that point, you

36:29.376 --> 36:37.787
were a communist, you were guilty of treason if you 
spoke out against the Vietnam War. Do you think the

36:37.808 --> 36:44.517
results of the war would have been different? Say 
the war was in 59, intense in 59 instead of 69, and

36:45.509 --> 36:59.071
looking at the people of that era, do you think that 
the protests would have been strong, or do you

36:45.509 --> 36:59.071
think there might not have even been any? It would 
have been very weak protests. I mean, you probably

37:00.894 --> 37:08.245
had some protests on campuses in some of the major 
cities, but very, very few. Yeah, I think at that

37:08.265 --> 37:11.230
point there would have been very little 
opposition. What was it that made the 60s, in your

37:11.952 --> 37:18.704
opinion, what made them different from the kids in 
the 50s? Well, I think this unwillingness to just

37:18.724 --> 37:28.320
accept things, a feeling that you just can't 
blindly obey what the government has to tell you.

37:28.340 --> 37:29.662
You can't just accept things. There's a feeling 
that you can change things, you can make things

37:30.363 --> 37:35.412
better.

37:36.404 --> 37:38.106
I think a lot of us do very literally. Can we say, 
yes, now what the country can do for you or what you

37:38.126 --> 37:43.454
can do for your country? And part of it, I think, we 
felt was that if the government's policy is wrong

37:43.754 --> 37:51.405
or it's not what we believe to be correct, we've got 
a right to speak out. In fact, we do need to speak

37:51.425 --> 37:54.549
out. And I think that was more of what people in the 
60s felt. You don't just accept it. Where, deep

38:01.362 --> 38:03.886
down, do you think that ideology comes from? Is it 
strictly from what Kennedy said? Was it because of

38:05.628 --> 38:06.830
upbringing? Not so much. High school education? I 
think perhaps education. I think it was more

38:11.116 --> 38:23.414
having education, both high school and college, 
where you, I think, professors perhaps had some,

38:11.116 --> 38:23.414
particularly in the more difficult 
universities, this idea of questioning

38:11.116 --> 38:23.414
authority. And I think that's probably most with 
it. You think it also? because of the intensity of

38:28.531 --> 38:31.875
McCarthy and his campaigns. And since that had 
died out, do you think that some of the braver

38:31.895 --> 38:38.544
students were willing to speak out? Whereas if 
they wanted to say something in the 50s, boy, they

38:38.564 --> 38:42.829
would have thought twice. Well, I think in the 50s, 
there was certainly a climate of fear of being

38:43.169 --> 38:51.119
labeled a communist, where that would just ruin 
your whole life, your whole career. Whereas in the

38:52.061 --> 38:55.585
60s, it became, especially in the late 60s, It 
became acceptable to voice opposition, and that

38:56.105 --> 39:02.631
was not the end of the world for you. It would mean 
you could never expect to have a family and live and

39:02.751 --> 39:08.156
have a decent job or something. Whereas in the 50s, 
I think that was part of it. People were very much

39:11.719 --> 39:16.824
afraid of being labeled or branded something that 
was decent. Excuse me one second. Yeah. Let's see

39:18.025 --> 39:21.368
if we're about ready to... If you want this. Have 
you ever thought about writing a book? No worries

39:25.045 --> 39:26.727
about what happens. Well, I've thought about it. 
I've got, you know, some of my notes and some of the

39:27.968 --> 39:33.333
things in the newspapers and things somewhere. 
And I've thought about that, but it's a question of

39:33.913 --> 39:38.518
time. I've been involved since I've gotten out of 
law school in building a practice, a fairly busy

39:38.578 --> 39:46.786
practice, and it's just been very difficult. You 
know, just time, making time for vacations or

39:46.806 --> 39:53.432
getting away and relaxing when I'm out or 
something like that.

39:57.783 --> 40:21.175
You made

39:57.783 --> 40:21.175
a

39:57.783 --> 40:21.175
statement in the article that said, I want to be 
free to represent those who can't afford an

39:57.783 --> 40:21.175
attorney, especially those oppressed by the 
government. And you mentioned in your first

40:22.276 --> 40:26.001
interview that you saw part of the It's more 
effective to be a part of the legal system. You

40:29.536 --> 40:35.123
could question it easily, more easily, to be a part 
of it. Along those lines,

40:35.724 --> 40:42.712
is that the main reason? And I remember also you 
saying that you'd always want to be a lawyer ever

40:42.832 --> 40:47.458
since you were young. But you think because of what 
happened to you that you decided, made your

40:47.478 --> 40:53.946
decision to Yeah, I think so. After what I went 
through in Southwest Texas State, I decided that I

40:55.445 --> 41:02.816
would pursue a legal career. And the realization 
that the legal system was society's way of

41:02.836 --> 41:14.193
fighting, and it's an acceptable way of combat, 
trying to bring about change. And so that's why I

41:14.213 --> 41:17.658
decided to get into the legal system. And that more 
gave me the interest to go forward with that

41:17.678 --> 41:21.704
decision. We had a civil rights case now. think 
back on the way your civil rights have been

41:24.335 --> 41:31.746
violated, does that almost motivate you to try to? 
I think that has some effect. I think about what's

41:32.827 --> 41:39.537
happened to me and I think about what's happened to 
my particular client at that time. And I can

41:39.657 --> 41:44.143
relate, I can empathize with what people are going 
through. And I think I have a good understanding of

41:44.203 --> 41:48.429
what's happening with them. How many people have 
you represented for free? Well, I'd say It's kind

41:53.866 --> 41:55.328
of hard to put numbers on. I've done a fair amount 
of, I've done some domestic relations work for

41:55.348 --> 42:01.136
three to four people. I've done the civil rights 
work and the police brutality type cases, which I

42:01.216 --> 42:08.587
think have started out being for free. But because 
we've been successful, the government has been

42:08.647 --> 42:15.176
forced to pay attorneys for us. So that, it's kind 
of hard to put a clear number. I've done quite a

42:17.600 --> 42:23.468
number of police

42:17.600 --> 42:23.468
brutality cases. where we've been successful, 
you know, the city or the county, and I've done some

42:24.089 --> 42:35.907
in some rural counties around this area, have had 
to pay and put the expense. Of course, when I

42:36.348 --> 42:41.176
haven't won, then I've had to bear the expenses. Do 
you think you've been pretty effective so far?

42:43.379 --> 42:52.273
Well, I think I've been effective with the 
representation in the area of civil rights

42:43.379 --> 42:52.273
because

42:43.379 --> 42:52.273
it's resulted in One of the early ones I brought in 
Liberty County resulted in a complete revamping

42:53.317 --> 43:05.994
of their whole procedure and system, and also in 
firing some deputies. And this last election in

43:06.014 --> 43:14.225
Liberty County, there was a lot of focus on someone 
that I'm representing and on the policy of the

43:06.014 --> 43:14.225
sheriff. And the sheriff ended up losing his job. 
And the county is now trying to settle the lawsuit

43:16.988 --> 43:20.573
with us. I have represented an inmate who was 
beaten up by a jailer. And the jailer was later

43:25.691 --> 43:30.477
prosecuted

43:25.691 --> 43:30.477
for what he did. But it can bring about some 
effective changes. Not all the time. And the civil

43:35.783 --> 43:43.311
rights area is frustrating, too, because people 
tend to believe police officers more than

43:35.783 --> 43:43.311
citizens. And there are very many cases that I just 
cannot take, just from the sheer volume of time

43:43.331 --> 43:51.420
that any one case takes. And unfortunately, 
sometimes you don't take a case because there's

43:52.193 --> 44:00.949
just not enough damages to make it worthwhile to 
pursue.

44:02.231 --> 44:16.176
But I guess the frustration is that there needs to 
be more people involved and more time spent, and

44:02.231 --> 44:16.176
one person only has so

44:02.231 --> 44:16.176
much time. The other people in your group, the 
other nine, ten people, did any of those people

44:17.337 --> 44:22.284
pursue law? No, none of them did. One's a librarian 
in Austin, Illinois. One is a school teacher in San

44:28.514 --> 44:31.558
Antonio. One is a nurse in New Mexico. One owns a 
clothing store in San Marcos, or head shop, I guess

44:35.364 --> 44:40.772
is the name. Head shop or clothing store. Another 
is a social worker. another as an art teacher, and

44:46.143 --> 44:57.640
another as a piano tutor. We had a reunion back in 
1979 after 10 years, and we had a get-together last

44:57.700 --> 45:06.593
year. We've all gone different ways, but 
politically I think we're all All of us probably

45:12.181 --> 45:16.172
voted for liberal Democratic candidates last 
year. Only one of them voted

45:16.212 --> 45:21.747
for Reagan. Okay. One second. I think it's about 
time. Okay. Yeah, we'll do that.
