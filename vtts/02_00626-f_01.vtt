WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:23.721
It's been suggested that during this period while 
you were at the Hydrographic Office that research

00:03.355 --> 00:23.721
and development oceanography was directed by or 
divided up, if I may use that word, between Ewing,

00:03.355 --> 00:23.721
Islin, and Revell, that they sort of are working on 
plotting, as it were, expanding oceanography.

00:23.741 --> 00:29.348
Would you agree with that?

00:30.970 --> 00:32.552
You're talking... I'm talking about 46, 47, and 
48, when Scripps and Woods Hole and O&R began to

00:33.882 --> 00:45.078
think about what the future of oceanography is. 
Yes, I think that's probably a pretty fair

00:46.700 --> 00:53.129
statement. They certainly exerted a lot of 
influence in the Washington area.

01:03.329 --> 01:20.218
And

01:03.329 --> 01:20.218
I think it's hard in a way for

01:03.329 --> 01:20.218
me to recall too much what was happening at the 
institutions at that time, because I wasn't

01:03.329 --> 01:20.218
there. I wasn't in any of them. I was in Washington. 
I think it was really to kind of stabilize after the

01:24.878 --> 01:36.555
war and get things on what was looked at as more or 
less stable footing. There was, if I can go off on a

01:37.396 --> 01:50.295
tangent here for a moment, I showed you this 
morning this book by Vaughan, which is I have

01:50.663 --> 01:53.227
called NASCO one. NASCO is a term that came in 
later, but this was one of the early attempts

01:54.889 --> 02:19.624
of the National Academy of Sciences to look at the 
state of marine sciences in this country, which

01:54.889 --> 02:19.624
occurred in the 1920s, although that book of lawns 
was not published until essentially 10 years

01:54.889 --> 02:19.624
later. But there was another National Academy 
committee set up at about the time you're talking

02:20.245 --> 02:38.410
about, and I can't remember it exactly, at which 
Scripps, Woods Hole, and so on were asked

02:20.245 --> 02:38.410
essentially what they thought they wanted to do. 
And I can't recall any of the content, but there is a

02:38.490 --> 02:45.780
small publication resulting from that committee 
The only part of it I can recall at all was that

02:47.397 --> 03:11.593
Professor Thompson, who was then director of what 
were known as the Oceanographic Laboratories at

02:47.397 --> 03:11.593
the University of Washington, his chief emphasis 
that he just wanted to return to the pre-war

02:47.397 --> 03:11.593
status, which I thought was singularly 
unimaginative, as I remember. But yes, I think

03:12.254 --> 03:15.379
that... It was pretty much dominated by Woods Hole 
scripts, and then Lamont came on the scene, I

03:16.523 --> 03:23.994
guess, about that time. And then there was this 
flurry of establishment of essentially new

03:24.595 --> 03:41.842
laboratories,

03:24.595 --> 03:41.842
Chesapeake Bay Institute, Texas A&M in 
particular come to mind here, and there were

03:24.595 --> 03:41.842
several others, as I recall. What sort of fellow 
was Islin? What was he like? Well, I think I,

03:46.780 --> 04:13.362
although I was never sort of spent very much time at 
Woods Hole and so on, apparently I knew more about

03:46.780 --> 04:13.362
him than a lot of his people that more or less lived 
with him, in that he was very much sort of a lone wolf

03:46.780 --> 04:13.362
in a way, although he was quite outgoing in 
meetings and conferences and so on. His private

04:18.753 --> 04:31.564
life was something which was very much his own, and 
he lived on Martha's Vineyard, and later on near

04:18.753 --> 04:31.564
Boston, I think it was in Newton. I'm one of the few 
people who's ever been a house guest at the

04:33.166 --> 04:42.454
Estlunds as far as I know, and I don't know quite 
why.

04:43.430 --> 05:01.668
He was a real sort of a puzzle to me, in a way, because 
he was

04:43.430 --> 05:01.668
very imaginative in many ways, and very 
farsighted in looking ahead and so on. In fact, I

05:02.489 --> 05:08.475
was just thinking the other day that some of the 
things he said to me, at the time I thought were

05:09.097 --> 05:19.089
silly, and which I now look back on and see that he 
was just about 10 or 20 years ahead of anybody else

05:09.097 --> 05:19.089
and things. However, I always felt that he was in a 
sense anti-intellectual, which sounds kind of

05:19.769 --> 05:35.087
snobbish here, but his own background was only, I 
think, up to level of a bachelor's degree. And his

05:37.908 --> 05:40.752
degree, I think, was actually in anthropology. In 
other words, he didn't have a very strong sort of

05:40.812 --> 05:47.862
scientific background on which to build. And he 
tended to look for similar types of people, in many

05:48.282 --> 06:02.222
cases, who were interested but I would consider, 
in a sense, not scientifically qualified. Now, he

06:07.782 --> 06:24.546
made me a liar in a number of cases here, in that some 
of these people that he had joined the Woodso

06:07.782 --> 06:24.546
organization have turned out to be very 
outstanding. But I would venture that this, out of

06:24.586 --> 06:29.914
general average, was not too good. And one of the 
great deficiencies I felt at Woods Hole was that

06:30.367 --> 06:52.670
they never sincerely sought, I'm talking of the 
era when Islin was there, but it tended to carry on

06:30.367 --> 06:52.670
after he'd retired, was that they never really 
supported an educational program either at Woods

06:30.367 --> 06:52.670
Hole or anywhere else. They were very, very much 
sort of research-oriented here. And it was only

06:57.415 --> 06:59.918
when... I think it was Admiral Smith in particular 
later on saw certain advantages which could be

07:00.708 --> 07:15.521
achieved in terms of money by becoming an 
educational institution. They sort of switched

07:15.621 --> 07:20.285
in that direction, but I don't think they've ever 
really taken it very seriously. That's my sort of

07:20.405 --> 07:28.993
point here.

07:30.880 --> 07:38.890
So

07:30.880 --> 07:38.890
I asked Columbus one day, how do you recruit your 
people? And he said, oh, I don't worry about that. I

07:41.133 --> 07:44.437
have enough nice young men come knocking on my 
door. I never have to go looking for people.

07:49.463 --> 07:52.347
And I think this was true in many cases. They were 
nice young men, in the best sense of the word. What

07:58.074 --> 07:58.795
about Ewing? Oh, Ewing is an entrepreneur, 
obviously, and very aggressive, very different,

07:59.517 --> 08:27.887
and entirely different from Islin, with a very 
tremendously

07:59.517 --> 08:27.887
hardworking and

07:59.517 --> 08:27.887
broadly interested and

07:59.517 --> 08:27.887
very much the entrepreneur, as I said, capable of 
interesting people, raising money, getting

08:28.508 --> 08:36.600
things going, and so on. I think with a good eye in 
most cases for people that he hired to work with

08:36.780 --> 08:53.925
him, the main

08:36.780 --> 08:53.925
sort of reservation I have about Ewing, as I used to 
identify him, he was a cream skimmer. He'd get an

09:00.455 --> 09:22.815
idea, do enough work on it to sort of meet his 
particular interest at the moment, sometimes

09:00.455 --> 09:22.815
correctly, sometimes, I think, misinterpreting 
things, and then he'd move on to something else and

09:00.455 --> 09:22.815
leave it to other people to kind of come along and 
clean up Sometimes the mess, I think, he left

09:23.065 --> 09:28.570
behind him, in a sense. But I think we can, in a field 
such as this, we can always and should consider

09:28.590 --> 09:37.239
ourselves fortunate to have some people like 
that. We don't want everybody to be Morris Ewing.

09:39.941 --> 09:42.624
That same charge has been leveled against Revell. 
Would you agree with that? Well, Revell has

09:44.466 --> 09:50.912
switched around a great deal.

09:52.698 --> 10:17.187
And

09:52.698 --> 10:17.187
yet I think, again, it's hard to make offhand kind 
of judgments and evaluations, but his interests

09:52.698 --> 10:17.187
were clearly much broader than Ewing's. And I 
think it's fair to say that Ravel had, in a sense, an

10:18.230 --> 10:29.906
altruistic interest in many of these things, 
although they redounded to his glory in a way. But I

10:29.946 --> 10:37.316
think Ewing's concerns were always, as things 
affected Ewing. And I can't imagine Ewing getting

10:38.638 --> 10:47.190
involved in these programs in India and so on, 
Pakistan, as Ravel did, or or Ewing

10:47.693 --> 10:58.127
going to Harvard, as Ravel did, and entering an 
entirely new set of fields here. And so there's

10:58.147 --> 11:02.853
really some very major differences, I think, 
between them. Now, it's almost as if in, let's say,

11:04.195 --> 11:15.810
about 48 or 49, right before you decide to come to 
Washington, it's almost as if the ONR says, look,

11:16.280 --> 11:28.598
there's not enough oceanographers to suit the 
needs, and what we've got to do is move out and not

11:16.280 --> 11:28.598
only establish departments of oceanography, but 
establish particular kinds of departments of

11:16.280 --> 11:28.598
oceanography. We need, for example, chemical 
oceanographers, and where should that be and what

11:29.799 --> 11:35.187
should it be? We need people to work on the Gulf 
Coast, and what should they do and what should they

11:35.207 --> 11:38.692
be? Would you agree with that? Yes, I think my, I 
haven't thought about, these things for so long,

11:44.647 --> 11:51.496
and dates and events and so on are getting 
confused. But there was this sort

11:51.577 --> 12:08.139
of regionalism, yes, that we ought to spot places 
in appropriate coastal regions. And there was

12:08.159 --> 12:13.827
nothing in the Gulf of Mexico and so on. And then 
this Chesapeake Bay development came up, which

12:14.363 --> 12:41.350
was really, I think, possibly brought into being 
as much as anything else by the fact that ONR was

12:14.363 --> 12:41.350
willing to put some money into it, although it was, 
as I recall, sort of a tripartite arrangement at

12:14.363 --> 12:41.350
first of Maryland, Virginia, and ONR. And that was 
thought of as a center for sort of looking at large

12:42.241 --> 12:54.739
bays and estuaries, and so it was partly regional, 
partly sort of subject matter.

13:00.026 --> 13:10.341
I

13:00.026 --> 13:10.341
don't really recall any

13:10.793 --> 13:17.682
a strong impetus really towards sort of training 
programs, although they obviously came along

13:10.793 --> 13:17.682
with this in a way. ONR is always in the rather 
difficult position that they were not supposed to

13:18.363 --> 13:27.134
support education as such. And so it was often 
done, but it was budgeted for in essentially other

13:27.615 --> 13:38.168
terms here. They certainly wanted to help here, 
and Dr.

13:39.532 --> 14:06.720
Thompson was the director of what were then known 
as the Oceanographic Laboratories, which had

13:39.532 --> 14:06.720
existed since about 1930 when the Rockefeller 
money was available, and the laboratories were

14:07.139 --> 14:11.283
set up. And there was some teaching prior to the 
war, some local sort of work at sea with a very small

14:11.883 --> 14:26.097
vessel which was actually sold by the university 
during the war. So there was no vessel left here.

14:29.300 --> 14:36.707
When Dr. Thompson came back to the university,

14:37.058 --> 15:05.293
after the war he'd been in he had a commission in the 
chemical warfare branch of the army he tried to

14:37.058 --> 15:05.293
pick up the pieces and sort of re-establish a 
program here and found it very difficult because a

14:37.058 --> 15:05.293
lot of the people had moved away or died or got other 
interests there was no vessel here and so on so he

14:37.058 --> 15:05.293
was really faced with a real problem, and the first 
thing that essentially the ONR did here was

15:05.729 --> 15:28.210
provide a little money to essentially get a small 
vessel going again and to support a few people and,

15:05.729 --> 15:28.210
you know, as I indicated a while ago, kind of get it 
going a little bit as it had been ten years

15:28.882 --> 15:57.049
previously and so when I came out here ONR support 
was about a hundred thousand dollars a year and

15:28.882 --> 15:57.049
that was essentially the only support available 
and it was available on a it's really kind of block

15:28.882 --> 15:57.049
funding and it was out of this we began to develop 
the programs here so Yes, I think it was a

15:57.957 --> 16:05.487
deliberate effort of ONR to try and proliferate.

16:06.608 --> 16:22.429
But I think in many cases, if the availability

16:06.608 --> 16:22.429
of funds for some of these newer institutions and 
trying to get the University of Washington back in

16:06.608 --> 16:22.429
business again was essentially as long as it 
didn't interfere too much with the funding of

16:22.949 --> 16:35.729
Scripps and Woods Hole, which may sound like sour 
grapes, but I think that in a way this was a sort of

16:22.949 --> 16:35.729
situation. Who made contact with you to come out 
here? I don't know exactly what happened, but the

16:39.194 --> 16:48.028
man on the faculty or the administration here 
contacted me was the dean of the College of Arts and

16:48.262 --> 16:54.451
Sciences, Dean Lloyd Woodburn. And

16:55.933 --> 17:18.066
I don't know whether I'd been suggested by Tommy 
Thompson or just have, but

16:55.933 --> 17:18.066
they had realized, and I think this is sort of worth 
noting, that they couldn't go back to the kind of

16:55.933 --> 17:18.066
pre-war operations, that something had to be done 
here that would change the thing. And in the spring

17:24.710 --> 17:47.074
of 1951, the Board of Regents, which is our 
governing body, decided, I'm sure it was on the

17:24.710 --> 17:47.074
recommendation of Dean Woodburn, to create a 
Department of Oceanography in the College of Arts

17:24.710 --> 17:47.074
and Sciences. which then just changed the 
emphasis away from sort of a research activity

17:47.560 --> 18:03.903
towards an educational activity and made it 
entirely appropriate to go into sort of

17:47.560 --> 18:03.903
undergraduate as well as graduate education. 
There were two sort of separate entities here at

18:03.923 --> 18:16.200
the university which had been operated before the 
war and had returned to this sort of the situation

18:16.788 --> 18:29.443
after the war,

18:16.788 --> 18:29.443
both of them operated under this general title of 
the Oceanographic Laboratories, plural. And one

18:31.165 --> 18:39.635
was a facility at the Friday Harbor on the San Juan 
Islands, which is a field station type thing. And

18:40.376 --> 18:46.423
the building that had been erected on the main 
campus here, which with Rockville

18:50.133 --> 18:54.458
here is hidden by the other edifice here now. These 
two things were operated jointly under Professor

18:54.478 --> 19:00.545
Thompson. And when I came out here, the assumption 
was that I would operate both of them. But for a

19:06.092 --> 19:13.681
variety of reasons, it seemed much better to me to 
operate them separately. But I was not only, I was

19:13.781 --> 19:19.988
called executive officer Department of 
Oceanography and director of the Friday Harbor

19:20.221 --> 19:24.688
Laboratories. And I had two jobs, in effect, for 
some seven years, I think it was. And then someone

19:32.539 --> 19:38.448
else took over as director at the Friday Harbor 
Laboratories. But I had dual sort of jobs here.

19:45.736 --> 19:54.128
mentioned earlier I got into sort of 
administration of one kind during the war,

19:45.736 --> 19:54.128
administration of kind of another kind in 
Washington. I came out here and I got into still

19:54.208 --> 19:58.815
another kind of administration. So in many 
respects I haven't been a research scientist for a

19:59.736 --> 20:10.552
long, long time here and it was more by accident 
than I think by choice. When you came to the west to

20:13.647 --> 20:15.869
visit the dean, what did he tell you? What about the 
Department of Oceanography he wanted you to find?

20:19.413 --> 20:37.873
Oh, I think that

20:19.413 --> 20:37.873
I had

20:19.413 --> 20:37.873
fairly strong ideas at that time about what I 
thought I wanted to do. And part of it had come out of

20:38.674 --> 20:42.118
some deliberations that had gone on, and I can't 
really remember at the moment who prompted them,

20:43.195 --> 20:58.080
whether it was ONR or some other agency. We had a 
number of meetings on essentially education in

20:58.480 --> 21:05.592
oceanography, and there was a paper was finally 
published, and I think it was in Science, if I

21:06.331 --> 21:21.726
remember correctly, by Redfield and I think 
Revell and several others, sort of setting out

21:06.331 --> 21:21.726
what they felt the curriculum in oceanography 
ought to be. And this was part of what I sort of had in

21:21.746 --> 21:26.591
mind when I came out here. In other words, I wasn't 
operating entirely on my own hunches here. There

21:32.676 --> 21:33.317
was some agreement in a sense as to what might be 
done now that what was different here was the

21:34.107 --> 22:02.325
opportunity to get into the undergraduate 
program and this it took us about a year I think to

21:34.107 --> 22:02.325
develop a sort of program of courses and so forth 
that we thought we could start with and and

22:03.233 --> 22:26.288
we had our first students i guess in in about 1952 
now uh this is in effect now the first institution

22:03.233 --> 22:26.288
of undergraduate oceanography in the country and 
possibly in the world uh so what sort of students

22:03.233 --> 22:26.288
did you look for

22:30.368 --> 22:38.277
Well, I don't know whether we looked for a 
particular kind of students, because students

22:30.368 --> 22:38.277
kind of come to you in a case like this. What we felt, 
and I think correctly, was that we were offering

22:40.640 --> 22:57.439
them a sort of an interesting field, but more 
particularly, an opportunity for students.

22:57.773 --> 23:07.373
obviously science-oriented, and in a sense here, 
basically science-oriented, a basic science

22:57.773 --> 23:07.373
orientation. A

23:07.393 --> 23:18.415
field where the student could be a kind of a 
scientific generalist rather than a specialist

23:19.120 --> 23:33.349
And I've always felt that way, and I feel it even 
more so today, that I'm not saying it's the kind of

23:19.120 --> 23:33.349
program that should be available for everybody

23:19.120 --> 23:33.349
or it really shouldn't displace the kind of 
specialist programs. But I think there should be

23:35.505 --> 23:47.502
opportunities at all levels for students who have 
an inclination towards being broad, being

23:35.505 --> 23:47.502
generalists, interdisciplinary, and these 
other terms that are used. There should be some

23:47.522 --> 23:49.344
opportunities for that. And this is essentially 
what we started out with this in mind. The other

23:56.114 --> 24:02.222
sort of things we had in mind was to prepare people 
really for jobs in agencies such as hydrographic

24:02.658 --> 24:14.071
office and other government and state agencies 
who needed people. The other institutions at that

24:15.272 --> 24:32.631
time were all post graduate and really all they 
were interested in were doctoral people so they

24:15.272 --> 24:32.631
were training all the generals but they didn't 
have any Indians to go along with them and I felt

24:15.272 --> 24:32.631
that not very glamorous, but certainly a need that 
I thought we could meet, and I think we did fairly

24:33.050 --> 24:43.904
well. The original sort of concept was that all the 
students would go through a similar sort of

24:45.245 --> 24:58.602
curriculum, but this only lasted for a relatively 
few years, and then we began increasing in

24:59.257 --> 25:05.442
numbers, and the research programming 
increased, and there were more faculty, and so

24:59.257 --> 25:05.442
forth. And I found I was essentially fighting a 
losing battle here, because all of the

25:06.243 --> 25:29.263
options, as we used to call them in the department, 
physical, chemical, biological, geological,

25:06.243 --> 25:29.263
and somewhat more recently geophysical, all 
wanted to have their own sort of program So this

25:29.783 --> 25:44.031
idea of a kind of a basic common undergraduate 
preparation gave way to, again, more specialized

25:29.783 --> 25:44.031
optional programs in these sort of five fields. 
And I got sort of out of sorts with this as the years

25:45.353 --> 25:51.505
went by. a swing in the other direction now, and 
they're beginning to feel that maybe there is some

25:51.974 --> 26:00.181
merit to having people who set abroad training 
again. But it's taken 20 years or so for the

26:00.321 --> 26:07.928
pendulum to swing, and it hasn't moved very far in 
that direction. When you started choosing

26:08.769 --> 26:11.912
faculty, what sort of faculty did you look for? 
Well, this is more or less, you know, kind of

26:12.873 --> 26:21.340
parallel to the students, so there's no one to look 
for. When

26:21.742 --> 26:51.411
I came out here, Professor Thompson, who was a 
chemist and chemical oceanographer, Cliff

26:21.742 --> 26:51.411
Barnes, who was originally a chemist but more so a 
physical oceanographer, Morris Rattray, who had

26:21.742 --> 26:51.411
come in just finishing his PhD from Caltech, who 
was a theoretical hydrodynamicist, and myself. I

26:55.200 --> 26:56.702
think that was about it. We had really nobody in the 
geological area, nobody in the biological area,

26:57.484 --> 27:15.610
and so part of my job was to obviously try and find 
some people in these two sort of fields, and it

26:57.484 --> 27:15.610
turned out be just as hard as it had been during the 
war and back in the Hydrographic Office to find

27:16.012 --> 27:24.001
anybody to go into these areas.

27:29.086 --> 27:45.124
The first geological oceanographer I was able to 
add to the faculty was Howard Gould, who's now and

27:29.086 --> 27:45.124
has been for a number of years with the Humble 
Research Laboratories in Houston. And he spent

27:52.154 --> 27:59.843
several years with us and then felt he wanted more 
money and so on, so he went to Humble. And the next

28:00.864 --> 28:09.615
geologist I recruited was Joe Krager, who was a 
brand new PhD out of Texas A&M. He was one of the very

28:09.635 --> 28:12.939
first of the PhDs. But these people had very little 
sort of experience themselves. I mean, they were,

28:19.086 --> 28:25.574
as the most recent PhDs, and they had to, in a sense, 
learn a lot on the job here. Not as far as this sort of

28:25.975 --> 28:30.640
research, I'm not saying that, but from a teaching 
point of view. The biologists turned out to be

28:31.642 --> 28:44.878
almost equally hard to find anybody who was not 
strictly a sort of a biologist, but had some of the

28:31.642 --> 28:44.878
interests of what I would identify as a biological 
oceanographer, which meant some other

28:45.230 --> 28:51.315
background.

28:54.959 --> 28:59.322
This turned out to be just as hard to find anybody 
there.

29:02.805 --> 29:08.530
This has more or less persisted, I think, even up to 
today. One of the things that strikes me all the

29:08.610 --> 29:14.916
time is that you can clearly fine research people 
these days. Often, however, with really very

29:21.107 --> 29:30.942
narrow kind of preparation, but very few of them 
with any kind of teaching experience. Now, maybe

29:30.962 --> 29:43.300
one of our contributions here has been the fact 
that an awful lot of graduate students have been

29:30.962 --> 29:43.300
teaching assistants here, a kind of experience 
they never got in any of the other places. and do go

29:43.786 --> 29:50.084
out of here, not all of them, but a good many of them, 
with some kind of feeling about what the teaching

29:43.786 --> 29:50.084
job is. How are you doing?
