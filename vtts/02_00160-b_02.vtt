WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:26.275
in all cases by eight o'clock at night nine o'clock at night no ten o'clock because that's when Graham staff and Duncanville came in and said that they we won we heard that four precincts hadn't come in yet and we heard this from our county chairs who then sent people

00:26.677 --> 00:36.158
We actually went and looked in Cleburne to the schools where the polls were and the people were still in the polling places.

00:37.702 --> 00:40.568
In Cleburne it was really funny because there was only one phone

00:40.987 --> 00:45.711
and it was in the principal's office, and it didn't have blinds and curtains, and they were on the phone a lot.

00:46.832 --> 00:54.419
And those four precincts came in literally 24 hours, all of them together, all 24 hours to the hour after the polls closed, and we lost by 105 votes.

00:54.439 --> 01:03.126
All right, so... Actually, we lost by 175 roughly at that time, and then when we did a recount, we lost only by 105.

01:03.166 --> 01:06.649
And how many votes were involved?

01:06.669 --> 01:07.190
85,000.

01:07.570 --> 01:08.831
No, no, in those four precincts.

01:08.911 --> 01:10.032
Oh, in those four precincts?

01:10.670 --> 01:20.183
The only one I remember specifically was we lost a black precinct in Mahaya where everybody had one vote each of the six candidates and there was a lot of undecided.

01:20.203 --> 01:21.505
We lost at 33 to zip.

01:22.867 --> 01:23.869
That's the only one I remember.

01:26.032 --> 01:33.302
And did you all have any important financial contributors, backers?

01:33.873 --> 01:34.934
No.

01:34.994 --> 01:39.039
Well, we had people that were important to us.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.503
But you didn't have any major.

01:41.943 --> 01:47.310
We had a little bit out of Fort Worth's oil deal that they came in right at the end.

01:48.291 --> 01:54.759
We had some people here that gave actually a lot of money for what they probably could give in Brassus County.

01:56.001 --> 01:57.062
But your total...

01:57.683 --> 01:59.367
Expenditures were about what?

01:59.387 --> 01:59.667
68,000.

01:59.707 --> 02:00.810
68,000.

02:00.890 --> 02:02.213
I still have the records.

02:02.273 --> 02:03.015
It's unbelievable.

02:03.035 --> 02:06.182
I boxed about it because I figured one day Chet may be president, so they'll be working.

02:06.202 --> 02:06.863
And this is 1978.

02:06.883 --> 02:07.665
78.

02:08.006 --> 02:12.195
The Democratic primary, but in those days the Republican.

02:12.215 --> 02:12.456
That was it.

02:12.476 --> 02:14.420
There was no Republican in the general.

02:14.440 --> 02:17.667
Whoever won the primary won.

02:18.710 --> 02:27.377
There are a lot of good things to say about Tiger, and Chet would never, ever say this, but I've always been kind of the Maverick, so I will.

02:27.838 --> 02:29.299
And I like Mr. Teague.

02:29.319 --> 02:30.300
I thought the world of him.

02:30.340 --> 02:45.552
He's had an enormous impact, but he was so mad at Phil Graham, and he wanted in the worst way, I think he really wanted to stay on for another couple of terms and God be forced it in 76.

02:46.413 --> 02:48.615
He wanted in the worst way

02:48.983 --> 02:50.204
to get back at Graham.

02:50.465 --> 03:00.475
And I can remember a week out, we got together, Chet and I were with he and Mr. Teague at a Marriott in Houston.

03:01.957 --> 03:04.119
And it was the one down by the Astrodome.

03:05.260 --> 03:08.544
Was he down there?

03:08.664 --> 03:10.366
I think it was in Houston.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.649
And Mr. Teague said, I'm gonna get involved.

03:14.050 --> 03:16.392
And up until this point he said he wasn't gonna get involved.

03:17.215 --> 03:20.982
And I got all the stuff on Graham, and it's all going to come out.

03:22.606 --> 03:27.616
Even despite that, we were ahead and could have won that one.

03:28.237 --> 03:31.824
And that was a pretty tough broadside to come in at the 11th hour.

03:33.327 --> 03:34.710
Chet should have won that race.

03:35.170 --> 03:39.038
Chet's a much better man, much better officeholder now.

03:39.592 --> 03:43.276
because he said, you know, we did the recount, and I mean, it was clear.

03:43.876 --> 03:53.726
I went to all four precincts when we did the big recount in there, plus all the other ones that we did, and we raised the money overnight to do the recount, because it was expensive.

03:54.667 --> 04:01.474
And they were all paper ballots, and they'd start off in pencil and end up in pen, so it was really clear somebody was voting top of the ticket, top of the ballot.

04:02.375 --> 04:06.139
Chet never has ever said anything about that, never will.

04:06.642 --> 04:26.170
very few people would understand that he ate a lot of pride and could have been very, could have taken us to court, could have put it in the media, but he said, you know, I may want to run again in the future, and that's the kind of person Chet is, and bless his heart, he did the exact right thing, and he learned from his mentors.

04:27.932 --> 04:29.995
Don't give me back on that campaign.

04:31.217 --> 04:32.599
Coming back to the campus.

04:33.271 --> 04:39.277
When you were a student here in the mid-70s, describe the A&M student body in general.

04:39.757 --> 04:40.958
Where did they come from?

04:41.098 --> 04:42.300
What were their attitudes?

04:42.340 --> 04:44.542
What kind of families did they come from?

04:44.582 --> 04:52.950
When we started, when we left, that was 77, September, or 71, rather, and I left in July.

04:52.990 --> 04:55.272
Well, we left in August of 77, two different worlds.

04:56.873 --> 04:57.554
Compare them.

04:57.614 --> 05:02.839
Freshmen, agricultural, rural, heavy,

05:03.157 --> 05:06.605
I mean, the Corps basically ran everything still then.

05:06.625 --> 05:08.850
I mean, we block-boated, everybody was Corps.

05:11.235 --> 05:16.828
Women came on campus in Kruger-Dunn my sophomore year.

05:18.023 --> 05:28.738
the Corps changed dramatically, to our credit, to Rick Gray and Corps staff's credit, and Corps staff, and the Commandant's Office at that time.

05:28.778 --> 05:31.262
We were smart, we let women in the Corps my senior year.

05:32.023 --> 05:33.244
A lot of dissension.

05:33.805 --> 05:36.589
My class, 74, was really mad.

05:37.075 --> 05:45.706
A lot of dissension in my class, we used to have junior get-togethers by people on course staff and brigades and some of us stayed around out at it.

05:45.726 --> 05:49.371
Stu Rayfield was working at a place out of town and it had a lake pond in it.

05:49.451 --> 05:50.612
We'd go out there.

05:52.375 --> 05:53.096
Smartest thing we did.

05:53.997 --> 05:55.439
We didn't become a VMI.

05:55.619 --> 05:56.560
We didn't become a Citadel.

05:59.023 --> 06:02.087
Best thing that happened at A&M was that

06:02.354 --> 06:08.582
Dr. Williams and the faculty leading at that time, you and all the other ones set to go.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.003
We were going to be world class.

06:11.245 --> 06:17.813
And women have contributed enormously to what's happened.

06:18.113 --> 06:26.303
It's been neat to watch women take positions that historically have always been male, move through those fairly quickly and get some really bright people in.

06:27.093 --> 06:36.963
And to watch this university grow from 14,000 our freshman year to I think we were saying it was like 33 or 36,000 or something like that by the time we left here.

06:39.065 --> 06:43.369
You can see a sense of destiny starting to form among the student body.

06:43.690 --> 06:45.391
We were can-do.

06:45.431 --> 06:46.853
We were going to make things happen.

06:46.913 --> 06:50.717
We were going to have an impact and we would not let any more Vietnams take place.

06:51.417 --> 06:54.581
And that was kind of that spirit.

06:55.561 --> 06:57.083
It's funny because most of us are here

06:57.400 --> 07:00.826
49 and 50 now, and I don't think we've changed all that much.

07:00.947 --> 07:05.194
All right, but now, also, but during this period, there were no protests?

07:05.455 --> 07:05.675
No.

07:05.695 --> 07:06.838
Organized protests?

07:06.938 --> 07:07.679
No, no, no.

07:07.699 --> 07:11.967
It was, I mean, it was at the height of Vietnam.

07:12.942 --> 07:26.693
Corps was wrestling with, I mean, we had guys that had been in the class of 67 and 68 during Tet and afterwards and left as sophomores and juniors to go enlist in the Army and the Marines and then come back and go to school.

07:27.094 --> 07:28.538
And some of them were in our outfits.

07:28.758 --> 07:30.883
So we had a sense of what war was like.

07:31.117 --> 07:36.206
in a very removed, abstract kind of way from living through what they saw.

07:38.049 --> 07:43.699
But no, it was a very shielded place compared to Austin and any of the other places.

07:45.061 --> 07:50.290
How, in general, how were those, as coeds come in large numbers, how were they treated on campus?

07:50.708 --> 07:53.595
Initially, that first semester must have been horrific for some of them.

07:53.715 --> 07:59.629
I mean, we were pretty, core was pretty childish in hindsight.

08:00.230 --> 08:07.367
We made extra effort with the outfit banners that the freshmen would put up to be absolutely grotesque about women.

08:07.735 --> 08:11.419
when they would walk by the quad, we would be absolutely at our worst.

08:13.361 --> 08:15.563
Now they were in their one outfit then?

08:15.823 --> 08:18.306
No, this was my sophomore year.

08:18.346 --> 08:20.048
This was the first year on campus.

08:20.088 --> 08:24.252
They were in one dorm of Krueger and half a dorm of Dunn.

08:25.013 --> 08:26.735
Oh, so they're not in the Corps.

08:26.755 --> 08:28.357
They didn't even in the Corps in my senior year.

08:28.717 --> 08:33.642
So my sophomore year, we were all being belligerent to them and pretty bad.

08:34.027 --> 08:37.932
After a while we figured out it was pretty nice to have women on campus and we can get dates.

08:37.972 --> 08:41.516
So we started to change and they started to change and things happened.

08:42.397 --> 08:47.283
And then they came in a senior year into the Corps and yes they were in one outfit at that time.

08:47.643 --> 08:50.646
And we regressed.

08:51.287 --> 08:57.975
There's 74 and 75, the two classes, the immediate past seniors in ours class.

08:58.478 --> 09:01.283
probably could have done things a whole lot different.

09:01.984 --> 09:05.069
And you saw it in weird ways that should never have happened.

09:05.770 --> 09:12.882
Louie Goert and Meryl Mitchell had been heartthrobs, and everybody thought they were going to get married, and Meryl dumped Louie.

09:13.363 --> 09:23.760
So we had this great out point my senior year, and I took Louie on a King's deal up and down the quad, and everybody signed this long deal of toilet paper to send to Meryl,

09:24.112 --> 09:33.075
So there was a lot of that angst going on about women being on campus and what they were doing and they were changing A&M, but best thing that ever happened.

09:33.663 --> 09:38.208
Now during that period, did the old relation with TWU pretty well?

09:38.488 --> 09:38.969
Yeah, absolutely.

09:38.989 --> 09:41.291
We went to One Pig Push our freshman year and that was it.

09:42.272 --> 09:44.254
You didn't even think about TWU after that.

09:44.895 --> 09:47.297
Unless it was really a last resort.

09:48.318 --> 09:52.082
Did we still have at that point an Aggie sweetheart from TWU?

09:52.102 --> 09:55.065
Yeah, all the way up and through, I think my senior year.

09:55.306 --> 09:57.628
Maybe even into the year after that.

09:57.862 --> 10:15.297
uh... still did a lot of try to do a lot of things with t w do you but it was totally different it wasn't women coming on buses to campus anymore it was women here in the women it goes back that's how kathy got there it goes back to the kinds of women we try to attract recruit

10:15.749 --> 10:19.695
And we brought bright, articulate, challenging people.

10:20.075 --> 10:21.317
And it'd be interesting.

10:21.337 --> 10:26.765
I wonder how many of us in 74, 5, 6, 7, and 8 classes got married to Aggies.

10:27.226 --> 10:28.828
I'll bet there's a lot of us out there.

10:29.189 --> 10:31.131
And it'd be interesting to know that number.

10:31.532 --> 10:35.277
It was a good time because you could see this place changing.

10:35.578 --> 10:40.525
And, you know, one of the ads that we see on TV now about is during the athletic games is

10:40.792 --> 10:43.059
The prophet's saying, I want my students to make a difference.

10:43.600 --> 10:50.199
I don't know about today's students, but I can tell you that wasn't said, but it was sure demonstrated in actions when we were here.

10:50.921 --> 10:54.632
And that's some of the most important lessons we all walked away with.

10:54.730 --> 11:01.263
Were the big, the grand, old, formal dances still being held over in Cebisa?

11:01.644 --> 11:03.548
They were and they weren't.

11:03.568 --> 11:06.273
I think my freshman year there were still some big dances.

11:06.354 --> 11:11.123
I mean, even the Marine Corps dance, I remember going in my junior year.

11:11.243 --> 11:12.526
Boot dance, ring dance.

11:12.546 --> 11:16.013
Those were still here, but they weren't that big a thing anymore.

11:15.993 --> 11:17.555
Cottonball, was it gone?

11:17.575 --> 11:25.723
No, Cottonball was still here and all those kind of things, but at least in the group that I ran around with, it wasn't all that big a deal.

11:25.983 --> 11:31.689
Town Hall took on new meetings and a lot of the, the Town Hall, the MSC activities changed.

11:31.709 --> 11:42.000
I mean, you could see from when we got in, I mean, most of the Corps got out of student government, except to vote, got out of the MSC.

11:43.567 --> 11:47.252
my sophomore and junior year, we're just going to take our marbles and stay in the quad.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.355
I mean, and it was pretty much that.

11:49.695 --> 11:53.460
We had premier people get in there in leadership roles, and we opted out.

11:54.902 --> 12:04.935
By the time I was president of the MSC, there were very few corps in there, which is a shame because I think they missed a lot to have an impact at that time.

12:05.816 --> 12:12.004
The only time we heard from the corps in the student senate here in those years, there was a bunch of us that still had been in the corps

12:12.372 --> 12:15.118
was on real key issues.

12:15.138 --> 12:18.887
So the Corps was going through change at that time as well.

12:18.947 --> 12:27.748
It was becoming much more introverted if it was like a human versus staying very actively involved.

12:27.728 --> 12:35.178
And the positive thing was happening was all these new people that were coming to A&M with this can-do spirit were coming out of everywhere.

12:35.979 --> 12:41.246
And we had 1,500 students active in the MSC during the year I was president.

12:41.706 --> 12:43.789
And we put on a phenomenal amount of programs.

12:43.929 --> 12:50.998
And it was because people thought that they could take a $14,000 budget and bring in top people.

12:51.018 --> 12:52.420
It was neat stuff.

12:53.193 --> 13:06.831
During your years, as far as you and your buddies were concerned, what were the highest, in terms of honor, prestige, what were the highest student leadership roles on the campus?

13:08.954 --> 13:11.858
Two perspectives, one inside the Corps, one outside the Corps.

13:12.279 --> 13:14.281
Inside the Corps, Corps commander, absolutely.

13:14.702 --> 13:16.905
Actually it wasn't, it was the outfit

13:17.071 --> 13:19.815
It was D-2 commander.

13:21.317 --> 13:24.222
Then if you were smart, you got brigade, that was Louis, and then Corps.

13:26.926 --> 13:29.129
Nobody in the, I mean, this was back in the days.

13:29.189 --> 13:36.681
We had, we were having really bad arguments with student government, and we didn't think, because we'd lost the few leaders that we had in there.

13:37.522 --> 13:42.910
And this was when Barb and the others were coming in in 74, and

13:43.227 --> 13:48.974
It was changing and so we said we're gonna take our marbles and we're gonna stay in the quad to heck with you guys.

13:49.054 --> 13:54.461
So core stuff inside the core, it was RV and a command slot somewhere.

13:55.763 --> 14:05.695
Once you got out of it, the prime position, student body president and MSC president and core commander and to a large extent also RHA.

14:06.276 --> 14:10.421
RHA filled a big void at that time for the off campus students.

14:10.442 --> 14:12.424
What about Yale leaders and band commander?

14:13.872 --> 14:20.359
We all had a different perspective of Yale leaders.

14:21.801 --> 14:23.322
I may want to clean this one up.

14:23.362 --> 14:27.807
We figured if you couldn't do anything else, you could become a Yale leader.

14:27.847 --> 14:28.648
They were nice guys.

14:28.708 --> 14:31.171
They were not seen as student leaders.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.313
No, no, no.

14:34.054 --> 14:36.076
They were block voted, elected by the Corps.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.838
That was it.

14:40.231 --> 14:41.733
Band?

14:42.013 --> 14:44.256
No, not as much, because the band was just part of the advent.

14:44.276 --> 14:51.185
And in our case, I mean, if we won an outstanding unit three of the four years I was there, why would we want to be in the band?

14:51.685 --> 14:55.010
So, I mean, they were one of our competitors for awards.

14:55.430 --> 14:56.411
And it was like that for most.

14:56.431 --> 15:02.539
There were about ten units that really competed for the top three awards, for Hawkmouth, Yohan, and more.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.802
And we all competed.

15:04.982 --> 15:07.145
I mean, we kept up with what each other was doing.

15:07.986 --> 15:09.748
Things that you see now...

15:09.728 --> 15:13.332
in terms of how they keep up with grades and all that kind of stuff.

15:13.352 --> 15:16.635
We were, the 10 units were doing that big time back then.

15:17.736 --> 15:27.466
As far as you were aware, are you able to share any information about anything you knew about secret fraternities?

15:28.227 --> 15:29.328
No.

15:29.348 --> 15:31.450
You know, we talked a little bit about that last time.

15:31.470 --> 15:32.271
I don't, I don't.

15:32.691 --> 15:33.352
You weren't aware?

15:33.932 --> 15:38.537
No, there was no that I ever came across, and there may have been,

15:38.517 --> 15:42.061
There was always the core block vote on certain things, but that was about it.

15:42.081 --> 15:43.623
But no, there was not a secret from anything.

15:43.964 --> 15:55.278
And what was the student body general attitude about acceptance of folks from a different ethnic or race or religious background?

15:55.759 --> 15:56.420
Did that matter?

15:56.460 --> 15:58.382
We were pretty redneck back then still.

15:58.362 --> 16:04.831
and a lot of it's still centered on the Corps, but even in the civilians, particularly in the Davis Gary and the dorms that were over here.

16:05.692 --> 16:09.818
We had just tried to move off campus, and that's because we couldn't have enough dorms.

16:09.838 --> 16:16.287
So the dorms were still pretty much a mirror of what was going on in the Quad.

16:16.469 --> 16:24.782
And we had a, oh, man, one of the programs we put on was a Mideast debate, Arab and Israeli folks coming in.

16:24.822 --> 16:31.993
And it was in 206 over there in the ballroom area, and I thought Wayne was just going to come unglued on it.

16:32.854 --> 16:34.397
It was pretty divisive.

16:35.278 --> 16:39.945
So we were pretty... But did you and the typical students...

16:40.752 --> 16:45.223
Did it matter whether somebody else was Catholic or Protestant?

16:45.243 --> 16:50.736
It didn't to me and the folks that I ran with, but in those kind of high-profile areas.

16:50.776 --> 16:52.740
I mean, we had Middle East stuff going on back then.

16:52.760 --> 16:58.474
You had the 73 stuff, and so you had those kind of activities.

16:58.724 --> 17:02.468
No, I think those were in the years right before us.

17:02.548 --> 17:05.191
Our years were actually pretty lame in respect.

17:07.634 --> 17:15.442
Let's see, now there was no event of national or international significance that occurred that caused you to remember where you were when?

17:16.223 --> 17:17.064
No, not like Kennedy.

17:17.484 --> 17:19.146
Yeah, not like Kennedy or 9-1-1.

17:20.087 --> 17:27.195
Let's see, was the battalion of any significance in those days?

17:27.580 --> 17:29.802
Oh, yeah, they were adversarial.

17:31.324 --> 17:34.928
Yeah, Jared Needham was, I mean, it's funny, I can't remember all these names.

17:35.308 --> 17:38.892
Jared Needham was battalion editor of the year as president.

17:39.032 --> 17:41.154
And he was a good writer the year before.

17:41.174 --> 17:45.679
And he ripped us up one side and down the other on student service fees.

17:45.719 --> 17:47.821
Some of them, he was right on target, actually.

17:48.201 --> 17:52.626
And movies.

17:52.977 --> 17:55.623
The Pink Flamingo stuff was a big brouhaha.

17:55.864 --> 18:00.314
Bring in Rocky Horror Picture Show on campus and show it in Roto Theater was a big brouhaha.

18:00.475 --> 18:02.720
Aggie Con and Cephas always stirred up stuff.

18:03.241 --> 18:04.143
So they were always there.

18:04.183 --> 18:10.378
He really went after them, the student government, student senate types though.

18:10.848 --> 18:14.754
They were very much like the Dan Rather Press at that time, I mean.

18:14.854 --> 18:19.741
They were going after folks and becoming good journalists.

18:20.042 --> 18:20.683
Post Watergate.

18:20.963 --> 18:25.931
The community, where did you and your buddies go to have a good time off campus?

18:27.693 --> 18:29.075
Were there favorite night spots?

18:31.198 --> 18:32.581
Yeah.

18:32.841 --> 18:34.223
I'm filtering here.

18:34.540 --> 18:39.166
Yeah, a lot of it, my outfit was different.

18:39.346 --> 18:40.407
I mean, we were hard rock.

18:40.427 --> 18:41.669
Everybody would go out to Lakeview.

18:42.049 --> 18:46.635
And John, our senior year, would go out to Lakeview with a bunch of the B2 guys.

18:46.655 --> 18:47.656
What kind of music were?

18:47.696 --> 18:49.037
Country, primarily.

18:49.057 --> 18:52.742
I mean, we were obnoxious my senior year, junior year.

18:53.363 --> 18:58.188
Because on Friday nights after 5, you could put speakers in the window and rack it up.

18:58.449 --> 19:01.172
And so we had hard rock going, and everybody else was...

19:01.372 --> 19:04.735
blaring back at country, but we were the afferents in our alley.

19:06.037 --> 19:09.700
At Lakeview, did you go out there to dance or to drink or both?

19:09.720 --> 19:10.521
Both, that's what they went in.

19:12.002 --> 19:17.448
My senior year, Kathy and I were pretty much of a twosome, and I was doing stuff with MSC types.

19:18.388 --> 19:23.573
And we weren't, there was some drinking, because it was legal by then, but it wasn't a big deal.

19:25.335 --> 19:27.097
There were a lot of, I mean, we were really lame.

19:27.117 --> 19:30.400
We'd go play all day games on risk.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.572
and stuff like that.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.495
So we were really pretty lame compared to what it could have been.

19:36.936 --> 19:39.478
Nothing like what my freshman year was like.

19:39.499 --> 19:40.359
Where'd you go to the movies?

19:42.401 --> 19:44.103
That's how Kathy got mad at me.

19:44.143 --> 19:48.547
I never asked her out for a date for a half a semester because my VW was broken down.

19:49.007 --> 19:54.513
So we'd walk up here to that movie theater by... You mean the campus?

19:55.253 --> 19:55.473
No.

19:56.074 --> 19:58.176
We actually, there were a couple times we went to the campus theater.

19:58.679 --> 20:07.369
But no, we'd go up to over by over since they had the new movie theater open up by that time.

20:07.389 --> 20:07.569
Oh, okay.

20:07.589 --> 20:10.192
And so, you know, we were starting to get restaurants.

20:10.612 --> 20:22.746
And the big thing for the SPO crowd, Student Programs Office, I mean, literally four nights a week, I wish I could do this too, we would leave there at 10 or 11, drive over to Sambo's,

20:23.114 --> 20:24.857
and solve the problems of the world.

20:24.897 --> 20:29.566
And after Student Senate, the whole back room would be filled with people from Student Senate and MSC in there.

20:30.287 --> 20:42.188
And lots of patty melts or chili and cheese hamburgers followed by hot fudge sundaes that nobody can do anymore.

20:42.228 --> 20:45.434
But it was fun because we would be there just about every night.

20:45.474 --> 20:47.738
The waitresses knew who we were and it was fun.

20:47.802 --> 20:49.525
How often did y'all go to downtown Bryan?

20:51.489 --> 20:52.471
And whiskey bread?

20:52.511 --> 21:00.307
And even as a cadet, we didn't even get to, Buddy Williams had this, he ended up moving into what was that old restaurant, the Blue Star.

21:00.367 --> 21:01.710
We used to go to Youngblood's a lot.

21:02.062 --> 21:04.645
But nothing in downtown Bryan.

21:05.466 --> 21:10.392
Sometimes 3C, but there was a barbecue place up here up north that was actually much better, so we'd go there.

21:10.532 --> 21:11.212
Whiskey Bridge?

21:13.355 --> 21:16.038
What were the indulgences?

21:16.919 --> 21:17.920
What were people smoking?

21:20.143 --> 21:20.503
Nothing.

21:20.523 --> 21:25.949
I mean, it was cigarettes, but the crew I ran around with, no, nothing else beyond that.

21:25.969 --> 21:27.631
Did y'all even know the words?

21:28.432 --> 21:29.233
Yeah, yeah.

21:29.652 --> 21:35.875
And I knew some kids obviously that had, that smoked grass.

21:35.915 --> 21:38.565
You could smell it in the civilian areas every once in a while.

21:38.866 --> 21:42.932
A lot of Annie Greensprings and Boone Farm, way too much of that stuff.

21:43.974 --> 21:47.940
But nothing, I never really saw anybody that had drug problems.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.725
Did you all know heroin existed?

21:51.265 --> 21:51.726
Yeah.

21:51.746 --> 21:52.107
Oh, you did?

21:52.287 --> 21:54.450
Okay.

21:55.392 --> 21:56.113
In LSD.

21:56.373 --> 22:01.842
I mean, we knew it, but it was not, mainly because nobody could afford it in the group I ran with.

22:01.962 --> 22:03.364
It wasn't a big deal.

22:03.645 --> 22:07.050
And you've got to remember, most of the group I ran with, even though I was pretty much

22:07.317 --> 22:11.002
even in the YDs, was still fairly conservative folks.

22:11.482 --> 22:13.185
And these were people that went to work for Calvin Guess.

22:13.205 --> 22:15.528
They didn't go to work for somebody else.

22:16.209 --> 22:20.034
And let's see, people weren't smoking cigars and pipes by then.

22:20.514 --> 22:25.220
No, I started to smoke a pipe my year as MSC president, because I thought that looked cool.

22:25.541 --> 22:29.806
And I did it off and on for a while, mainly because it would calm down my adrenaline.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.650
But no, it was...

22:33.845 --> 22:36.328
Scars really weren't in evidence at all.

22:36.348 --> 22:44.135
Kathy started smoking cigarettes one semester, and she unfortunately hadn't been able to stop that, but outside of that, no.

22:44.776 --> 22:45.757
A&M traditions.

22:45.857 --> 22:47.799
Do you remember going to Silver Taps the first time?

22:47.819 --> 22:48.059
Absolutely.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.242
Every time.

22:50.262 --> 22:50.842
Still the same.

22:51.423 --> 22:53.205
I mean, I can still picture it.

22:53.325 --> 22:55.567
It's one of the most moving things I've ever been around.

22:55.727 --> 22:56.027
Why?

22:58.690 --> 23:03.615
Somebody would care about somebody they hadn't met before with that degree.

23:04.827 --> 23:17.587
The first time, we thought it was kind of funny, everybody would not only turn off lights, but when we came back, if you had to study, it was a study lamp, and you put towels over the window, or covers over the window, and towels over the door, and you didn't say a word.

23:18.889 --> 23:23.816
We had very few, my freshman year, they increasingly got more and more, because we had more students.

23:25.298 --> 23:32.269
But for somebody to spend thoughtful reflection time thinking about

23:32.772 --> 23:49.407
a part of a group that they've never even met by and large before, and taps being played from the top of the academic building, and the RV slid, I mean it's just, it's something that's always with you.

23:49.748 --> 23:54.012
And I don't think I missed one during my years here.

23:54.492 --> 24:01.058
Did you ever know of anybody attempting any kind of prank or joke or anything else during?

24:01.358 --> 24:05.704
lame jokes or easy jokes, but I mean, nothing real serious.

24:05.764 --> 24:11.571
I mean, the worst that I can remember on campus was the bra over at academic Louiswood.

24:12.112 --> 24:14.535
No, no, but I mean as a part of TAPS.

24:14.755 --> 24:15.436
Oh, TAPS, no.

24:15.716 --> 24:16.758
No, that's what I mean.

24:16.798 --> 24:17.799
No, no, no.

24:18.320 --> 24:26.590
The only, and we tried to get up, it was funny, we tried to get up in, we actually did get up in the old pigeon area of the academic building just to see what that was like, but no.

24:27.548 --> 24:29.551
I don't know, yeah, I'd be surprised.

24:29.872 --> 24:30.573
I never heard of any.

24:30.593 --> 24:39.868
Yeah, the only thing that was really, and it goes back to your earlier thing, there was a beginning sense that there were gay accusers back then.

24:41.210 --> 24:54.332
There was one guy in particular that was class of 74 in the band that was, whether he was or not, I think he probably was, but there was some of that starting and you don't go to the academic building at night.

24:54.768 --> 24:55.489
those kind of things.

24:55.529 --> 24:57.833
But that's really the only thing that was just different.

24:57.853 --> 24:59.336
I mean, we were pretty sheltered here.

25:01.319 --> 25:01.460
Uh-huh.

25:01.620 --> 25:02.041
Mustard.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.984
Do you remember going while you were a student?

25:04.004 --> 25:04.525
Absolutely.

25:05.006 --> 25:05.667
Where was it?

25:06.168 --> 25:08.031
It was in Johnny Raleigh the years that I was there.

25:08.472 --> 25:16.105
And, uh, uh, you know, one of the great things about A&M is we're very good about passing core values down.

25:16.646 --> 25:18.750
Taps and mustard

25:18.950 --> 25:24.275
And even to a large extent, bonfire are part of those values that you pass down.

25:24.295 --> 25:27.999
But particularly taps and mustard, that's what sets us apart.

25:28.019 --> 25:33.205
I mean, who else gets together on one day a year to remember those that have gone before them?

25:33.585 --> 25:34.746
I mean, it's very unusual.

25:36.668 --> 25:40.692
Do you remember when you bought your ring?

25:41.593 --> 25:42.514
Yeah, as soon as I could.

25:42.754 --> 25:43.936
How much did it cost?

25:44.796 --> 25:45.137
I remember.

25:45.157 --> 25:46.358
I've seen your boots cost $350.

25:47.890 --> 25:49.693
It was like a hundred dollars, wasn't that much.

25:49.713 --> 25:50.374
It may have been more.

25:50.975 --> 25:52.699
And you still have the same ring.

25:52.739 --> 25:53.099
You bet.

25:53.139 --> 26:02.035
And it's been lost, and somebody, bless their heart, found it and turned it in to the Dallas police, and I got it back.

26:03.719 --> 26:09.929
at Bader Hospital, we moved into Truett Hospital to put some admin offices in there in old patient rooms.

26:11.130 --> 26:16.379
So I had my wedding band and my Aggie had a bad habit because it kept quite filled with it.

26:16.439 --> 26:18.722
So I would take it off and put it on my wedding band.

26:18.742 --> 26:21.727
Somebody came in and stole it because it was on an unsecured floor.

26:22.408 --> 26:26.454
It got sold to a pawn shop and I got it back through the DVD that way.

26:26.474 --> 26:27.355
How good, how good.

26:27.616 --> 26:29.659
Yeah, you know, wedding band back and I got it.

26:29.639 --> 26:32.606
Any other Aggie stories, Aggie ring stories?

26:33.027 --> 26:35.713
Have you been somewhere where some on the other side of the world?

26:35.773 --> 26:41.286
The big thing back when we were here, and I really noticed it at,

26:41.705 --> 26:45.150
Actually, I noticed it most of the first 10 years afterwards, not so much since then.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.115
You see an Aggie with a ring, you always introduce yourself.

26:48.175 --> 26:53.764
I mean, it's just like, I mean, we did it at Astro, it was just a habit, and still do it.

26:54.846 --> 26:56.589
There's always that instant bond.

26:56.609 --> 27:03.239
We were in Blockbuster a couple of weeks ago, and there was a young Agg, or she's only a couple years behind us, with the lady in there.

27:03.339 --> 27:04.541
And so, yeah, you always do it.

27:04.682 --> 27:06.244
It's a good bond.

27:06.578 --> 27:13.248
How did you feel when you put on that ring and those boots the first time?

27:13.268 --> 27:14.429
Back to being king of the world.

27:15.911 --> 27:18.535
The boots, because you knew you'd earned them.

27:21.219 --> 27:34.999
We got boot privileges to walk outside of our room and only down the hall at our outfit barbecue in November, my junior year, and to put them on

27:36.042 --> 28:00.902
uh to get them off but to put them on you you just fell totally when did you buy your boots then uh we ordered um uh i ordered mine i think at the end of my freshman year you had to you had to get them in line and then we hadn't paid for them so we did you know we paid half of it at holix yes yeah where are yours now in my closet need to be shining but they're still there

28:01.743 --> 28:10.516
When you went through final review as a junior, what was it like?

28:10.556 --> 28:11.457
Describe that day.

28:14.462 --> 28:25.017
I was going through a lot of emotions then, mainly because there were only going to be three of us as seniors in the outfit.

28:25.486 --> 28:43.904
Louis was gonna be brigade commander, Bill Chancey was on his staff, and Warren had gone to core staff, and so there was just John Don and I. We'd been through a year where it was up to us as seniors to see if we could win more for a fourth time, which would have been unheard of.

28:44.925 --> 28:47.067
But we were gonna go after it, so it was very emotional.

28:47.968 --> 28:54.514
And Kathy and I were getting real serious at that stage of the game, so I was already starting to

28:54.747 --> 29:04.542
See, Kathy in high school wore a black armband too, and she's not a big anti-war, but she was very much against Vietnam and the military.

29:05.704 --> 29:14.297
And so she and I were already starting, I was moving outside the outfit, and so there was a lot of emotions in that one.

29:14.317 --> 29:19.185
What was more important was the next one, because we got married the day after Final Review.

29:19.553 --> 29:20.615
Your junior year?

29:20.675 --> 29:21.416
My senior year.

29:21.436 --> 29:22.297
Your senior year.

29:22.317 --> 29:26.664
I had a boot wedding, and John and Don and I had totally split by then.

29:26.684 --> 29:33.716
So I had MSC guys in my wedding party, and I didn't have John and Don, the CEO and XO, my outfit in there.

29:34.076 --> 29:40.887
I even went to the unheard of length of asking the four or three

29:41.137 --> 29:44.341
Actually, Ken Davis was our fraud.

29:44.361 --> 29:49.887
Ken and Louie Gohmert, Bill Chancey, and Warren, who were all staff rats, to be in the wedding party.

29:50.307 --> 29:57.555
And it was very obvious in there that there was, and we had to deal over in the MSC, and of course had the MSC crowd there.

29:57.575 --> 30:00.899
So it was really interesting, but we had to get, we had to reserve it.

30:00.919 --> 30:04.883
We got married in the afternoon, Sunday afternoon at Mother's Day on May 11th.

30:05.234 --> 30:08.019
We had to reserve that 14 months out.

30:08.039 --> 30:11.466
And so when we thought we might get married, we knew where we wanted to get married.

30:11.526 --> 30:12.668
We went immediately.

30:12.688 --> 30:17.457
I mean, we were just talking about it as we walked across campus over by the academic.

30:17.477 --> 30:21.745
We went straight over and found out who we needed to get on and actually signed up.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.290
And your marriage was held where?

30:24.591 --> 30:25.152
At the chapel?

30:25.312 --> 30:28.558
I'll face chapel, and then we did the reception in the MSC.

30:28.538 --> 30:30.826
And that's 1970?

30:30.846 --> 30:31.509
75.

30:32.051 --> 30:34.901
Five, okay.

30:35.122 --> 30:37.189
27 years ago.

30:37.811 --> 30:40.320
Commencement that year.

30:40.537 --> 30:47.706
Well, see, I was a fifth-year senior, so I actually graduated with my wife, which she takes great pride in saying, see, you're really in 76 anyway.

30:48.046 --> 30:49.468
So she and I graduated together.

30:49.508 --> 30:52.351
I mean, I went first with Jay and then Kay.

30:52.371 --> 30:55.054
And so we walked across the stage, and Jack was up there.

30:55.075 --> 31:00.621
And it was a hoot because, I mean, it was pure fun walking across the stage to get the degree.

31:01.122 --> 31:02.443
And he was chiding both of us.

31:03.525 --> 31:04.706
And every hand shaking?

31:05.247 --> 31:05.447
Yeah.

31:06.136 --> 31:07.318
He made a point of that.

31:07.758 --> 31:08.920
Did anybody leave early?

31:09.581 --> 31:10.322
No.

31:10.462 --> 31:11.163
Not that I remember.

31:11.183 --> 31:11.925
Not in that era?

31:12.225 --> 31:12.425
No.

31:12.646 --> 31:13.968
Do you remember who the speaker was?

31:15.290 --> 31:16.331
Almost nobody does.

31:16.391 --> 31:26.947
No, I remember sitting in the audience, because Murray graduated then too, and it was already where we're going to go from here type stuff.

31:27.027 --> 31:30.572
I mean, it was fun stuff, but I don't remember who the speaker was.

31:30.592 --> 31:33.156
Okay, as you graduated,

31:34.908 --> 31:40.094
how well did you feel A&M had prepared you for your future?

31:41.796 --> 31:42.737
Remember where I came from.

31:43.217 --> 31:44.579
Remember when we started this interview.

31:45.159 --> 31:49.764
You know, I haven't told many people about what my GPs were like.

31:50.906 --> 31:52.467
I felt rock solid.

31:52.487 --> 31:53.729
I thought I could do anything.

31:54.450 --> 32:00.977
And I mean, you think about it, Haskell, we didn't have a big career set up.

32:01.097 --> 32:04.881
We weren't recruited by somebody in a big corporate world.

32:05.114 --> 32:16.255
uh chet was going to pay 300 a month and we figured if that didn't work we'd find something else but we were both tenacious we both figured we could make our way and and we had all the skills that we needed
