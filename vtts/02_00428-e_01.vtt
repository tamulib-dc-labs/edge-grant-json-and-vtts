WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:05.005
Okay.

00:05.025 --> 00:21.811
This may sound that I'm serving the brass, but the 
one thing that I determined after becoming

00:05.025 --> 00:21.811
general officer was really that the 
responsibilities of a general officer are set

00:05.025 --> 00:21.811
apart and much greater than below. And the 
stresses on a general officer because of that are

00:23.474 --> 00:28.502
much greater.

00:32.161 --> 00:40.573
They're just a practice in the army that when you 
turn a problem over to a general officer, that's as

00:32.161 --> 00:40.573
far as you go with it. It's going to come back 
solved, or it's going to be solved on the spot.

00:46.582 --> 00:54.574
The positions that general officers are assigned 
to, generally speaking, are positions of

00:46.582 --> 00:54.574
tremendous responsibility. Sure. Oh, I don't 
know. I guess another evidence that that's true is

00:58.477 --> 01:02.465
Fran said, I changed. What did she say? In what way? 
In personality, in some ways, as a general

01:05.591 --> 01:07.996
officer. I was never conscious of it. What did she 
say? Well, she just said she never was that

01:12.385 --> 01:16.032
specific, but she just said, I changed. More 
domineering or...? Perhaps less tolerant, not so

01:19.613 --> 01:24.218
much more domineering. Did you think that you had 
changed? Less tolerant, less time for this or

01:26.060 --> 01:28.262
that. No, I wasn't aware of it. I think what was 
happening, I was adapting to the

01:31.746 --> 01:37.091
responsibilities I had. And to me, that was it. I 
was just adapted. I must tell you a little story,

01:43.418 --> 01:49.384
though, that's one of mine and Fran's favorites. 
You know, General Westmoreland's wife, Kitty,

01:50.579 --> 02:02.312
was a very attractive woman and a very good partner 
for him and

01:50.579 --> 02:02.312
a very friendly type.

02:05.375 --> 02:19.270
We had just had a ceremony in the Pentagon in which 
General Westmoreland pinned on the Brigadier

02:05.375 --> 02:19.270
General Starrs on two women, our first general 
officers in the army. Your first women general

02:20.026 --> 02:21.608
officers? The first women general officers in the 
Army. One was Colonel Hoisington, the Director of

02:24.312 --> 02:36.409
the Army Women's Corps, and the other was the Chief 
Army Nurse. The Chief Army Nurse was a personal

02:36.429 --> 02:41.857
friend of Ms. Westmoreland's. Shortly 
thereafter, Ms.

02:43.579 --> 02:49.948
Westmoreland was in the beauty shop, having her 
hair done at Fort Myer when the chief army nurse

02:51.346 --> 03:02.340
came in and Ms. Westmoreland greeted her again and 
congratulated her again on being promoted to

02:51.346 --> 03:02.340
brigadier general. And they conversed a bit and 
she said, by the way, I'm looking for a husband. And

03:10.711 --> 03:12.733
the chief army nurse was shocked. She said, what do 
you mean? She said, I'm looking for a husband for

03:17.539 --> 03:20.323
you. I want some man to know what it's like to live 
with a general.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.098
That is a good one. I thought that was delightful.

03:37.408 --> 03:39.892
That would be a switch wouldn't it? Speaking of 
women, let's not discuss the changes at A&M since

03:39.952 --> 03:49.146
the 1960s, and women of course is one of those 
changes. and I was wondering what you felt. Was it a

03:52.214 --> 03:57.581
good idea to allow women to go to A&M, or a bad idea? I 
can rationalize everything that's happened at

03:57.601 --> 04:00.365
A&M. Well, I want your opinions, not a 
rationalization. With regard to women, and with

04:04.050 --> 04:13.543
regard to voluntary corps duty, cadet corps 
assignment, but I have differences of opinion.

04:15.306 --> 04:17.749
Now, when I say I can rationalize it, I recall very 
much these two decisions, both taken, I believe,

04:19.872 --> 04:25.500
by General Rutter. And I didn't like them.

04:33.392 --> 04:40.703
But I, at the same time, said, well, gosh,

04:33.392 --> 04:40.703
I have been in A&M for years. I have no close 
knowledge of what the situation is. How can I be

04:43.687 --> 04:46.331
critical of that decision? But I lament the fact 
that we've come to the point, whatever the reason,

04:49.623 --> 05:18.972
that we changed the character of that magnificent 
cadet corps, which I think contributed so much to

04:49.623 --> 05:18.972
the individuals in it, and something distinctive 
in the form of the product of the corps, not just the

04:49.623 --> 05:18.972
military services, but to the professions or the 
undertakings that they entered upon when they

04:49.623 --> 05:18.972
graduated. And I lamented the fact that we found it 
necessary to admit women to A&M for reason of

05:21.162 --> 05:32.035
tradition and for the same reason, the cadet 
corps. So I guess you can say that I

05:33.256 --> 05:45.730
was so completely sold on the value of that cadet 
corps that I didn't want to see anything

05:33.256 --> 05:45.730
disturbing. I couldn't understand why we needed 
to admit women to A&M when we have, what is it, 13

05:50.643 --> 05:55.989
other state universities that will admit women.

05:58.813 --> 06:12.249
I didn't understand why we had to make the cadet 
corps voluntary when they had all these other

05:58.813 --> 06:12.249
choices for a state institution that can give them 
the same courses they can get at A&M. I simply

06:12.269 --> 06:19.958
thought, like any old-timer, most of us didn't 
want to see that change. What about blacks? Blacks

06:22.428 --> 06:24.412
I have no problem with, whatever. If you'll 
recall, the Army is the first institution in this

06:26.435 --> 06:32.928
nation that integrated the blacks. And it was a 
good move, and it was evident to everyone in the

06:32.948 --> 06:38.298
Army that it was a good move. No, I have absolutely 
no problem with that. Those were your ideas then in

06:42.483 --> 06:47.488
the early 1960s when all of these changes took 
place. Have your ideas changed? Not a bit.

06:53.975 --> 06:55.737
No, I'm proud of A&M today. It went from 6,000 to now 
about 34,000 in 20 years. I know. And I'm very proud

07:03.706 --> 07:06.769
of the standards they've maintained at A&M. I'm 
not close enough acquainted to evaluate that old

07:07.373 --> 07:13.319
Aggie spirit, but I can't be the same.

07:17.763 --> 07:26.792
But I'm not sure it's good to be so big, but I 
understand why we are. As long as we're a state

07:28.253 --> 07:35.440
institution, and particularly one of the two 
that's permanently endowed, to be a leading

07:36.348 --> 07:48.721
education institution in this state, and the 
state's paying these bills to keep us in business,

07:36.348 --> 07:48.721
how can we say, Mr. Texan, you can't enter A&M? 
We're full. When do you get full? You don't, as long

07:53.546 --> 07:55.548
as you can take care of it. So I deplore the

07:56.449 --> 08:03.216
excessive growth, in my opinion, But I understand 
it, and I wouldn't suggest that they change the

08:03.500 --> 08:09.048
policy. I don't know how they could. What's your 
opinion of General Orwell Rudder? I think he was

08:13.835 --> 08:17.820
great for A&M.

08:18.361 --> 08:19.983
Even though he brought about these changes? I 
didn't know him personally, but I think he was a

08:20.003 --> 08:24.490
great leader, and I think he was great for A&M. 
Yeah, I disagree with what he did for the reasons

08:24.550 --> 08:27.494
I've given. Sure. But I wasn't there making those 
decisions. Right. And I... And I didn't have the

08:32.508 --> 08:38.295
facts, and in the absence of those facts, how can I 
criticize him for making those decisions? By the

08:38.335 --> 08:54.476
way, a highlight of my

08:38.335 --> 08:54.476
post-retirement experience was that I was 
nominated for consideration to be president of

08:38.335 --> 08:54.476
A&M to succeed General Rutgers. No kidding. I 
wasn't aware of that. I was. I was asked for... but

08:59.930 --> 09:04.837
the university wrote me and asked me to submit 
information.

09:05.998 --> 09:23.102
And that alone was very flattering, and of course I 
appreciated it tremendously, and I knew some of

09:05.998 --> 09:23.102
the people who

09:05.998 --> 09:23.102
had made this suggestion and this nomination. But 
at the same time, speaking of General Rudder, I was

09:26.356 --> 09:32.223
not really in close contact with A&M for these 
years, never have been able to be. But it was coming

09:33.465 --> 09:39.932
through loud and clear to me that the faculty was 
getting damn tired of the general. And I think it

09:42.235 --> 09:52.988
was mainly over the issue of,

09:42.235 --> 09:52.988
what do we call it?

09:56.393 --> 10:02.843
When you've been there a certain number of years, 
you have tenure.

10:04.105 --> 10:07.130
You know, he always wanted to retain the right to 
fire anybody. At least that's the picture I got. So

10:12.098 --> 10:19.489
I never was unrealistic about my expectations in 
that contest to be named. Well, what was your

10:19.549 --> 10:21.512
response when they asked you? Oh, by all means I 
responded, yes. Do you think you would have liked

10:26.482 --> 10:27.905
that, John? Ten years ago, I would have, very much. 
You bet. Well, what happened? Did they call you

10:35.318 --> 10:36.641
down for an interview? No, I was never called for an 
interview, and I think, as I say, my expectations

10:37.602 --> 10:46.438
were not very high, but I was flattered just to be 
considered. Sure, absolutely. Anybody would be.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.994
just to be in the pot with the others. Of course, 
President Jack Williams was chosen to be

10:52.214 --> 11:01.247
president at that time.

11:01.267 --> 11:02.629
Well, I have one more question. Well, I guess I 
might have a couple more. Do you think A&M is a

11:05.293 --> 11:10.019
better institution today, or was it in 1940, 41?

11:12.263 --> 11:13.665
Well, you know I can't answer that. Okay, then one 
last one. Not from prejudice, but for lack of real

11:16.048 --> 11:18.632
knowledge. Okay. What are your feelings toward 
the draft? We were mentioning a little bit about

11:22.324 --> 11:24.347
that. Do you think that we should go away from the 
all-volunteer Army now and go back to the draft, or

11:25.429 --> 11:31.678
drafting women too? What do you feel about these 
things? Well, I'd be glad to respond on that. I feel

11:36.906 --> 11:44.617
that we need to go back to the draft, but I recognize 
how difficult it's going to be, and it's not going

11:36.906 --> 11:44.617
to be a matter of just saying, tomorrow we're going 
to go back. Yeah. But with the proper... national

11:49.878 --> 11:58.608
leadership and congressional leadership 
included, I think we can get back there. Now, one

11:59.349 --> 12:07.137
reason we need to go back to the draft is to get the 
population involved again, as I've outlined. But

12:07.157 --> 12:11.902
I don't believe we're getting in the volunteer 
services what we need. I don't believe we're

12:11.923 --> 12:18.670
getting the, we're falling short on numbers, but I 
don't think that's as significant as falling

12:11.923 --> 12:18.670
short in quality. By that I mean, really, the 
capabilities of the people to deal with the

12:20.919 --> 12:33.176
technicalities of the services. So I'd like to see 
us get back to a selective service system. Now,

12:39.064 --> 12:48.336
when we consider this, we've got to consider how is 
it going to be made fair this time.

12:48.856 --> 13:00.408
And I have a feeling that

12:48.856 --> 13:00.408
we really need to reinstitute some form of 
universal service in this nation.

13:02.169 --> 13:04.211
And so many people say it's so difficult. What will 
you do with all this youth?

13:09.277 --> 13:10.298
Well, by golly. We've talked before. I think that 
one in every six or seven people in this nation are

13:15.873 --> 13:22.862
working for the federal government or the state 
government or the city or local governments.

13:22.882 --> 13:27.148
Well, why can't we have enough spaces to put these 
young people in wherever? In the federal

13:28.430 --> 13:33.677
government, the state government, local 
government, or the military? And I think if we set

13:33.697 --> 13:37.562
it up properly, we'd have it in priorities. The 
military needs will be met first.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.593
And thereafter, some other order of priorities. 
And

13:46.028 --> 13:56.442
there's no reason in the world why we can't absorb 
those people if we make room for them. Don't add

13:56.543 --> 13:57.244
them on. Make room for them. If the Army can take a 
young soldier for two years and have an effective

13:59.747 --> 14:11.403
soldier from him, why can't you have a clerk from 
high school go into the city hall and be effective

13:59.747 --> 14:11.403
for two years? What about drafting women? I'm 
against it, because I don't think women should

14:15.408 --> 14:26.850
fight, and I don't think that women are that 
essential to a nation that's got a vast richness of

14:15.408 --> 14:26.850
manhood.

14:29.875 --> 14:36.488
Well, we talked about your early years, your 
career, your ideas on A&M and a number of other

14:29.875 --> 14:36.488
things. Is there anything that you have jotted 
down over there that you think that we should have

14:37.109 --> 14:41.095
covered? Anything that I've missed? Terry, I 
think you just brought it all out. There's only one

14:46.824 --> 14:50.129
thing that I'd like to say in summary here. I

14:50.149 --> 15:06.053
certainly don't consider that I'm an authority in 
any of these subjects that we've been talking

14:50.149 --> 15:06.053
about, but I do consider that I've been someone 
committed to... for 30 years to the security of the

15:07.012 --> 15:10.997
nation. And as such, I've had my own thoughts and 
considerations and judgments.

15:20.728 --> 15:27.236
So in review, I think that we're going to get 
straightened out with President Reagan, I think.

15:27.256 --> 15:34.044
But I think we've neglected

15:27.256 --> 15:34.044
the importance of national security for several 
years. We're out of focus.

15:38.078 --> 15:40.562
balance with our potential enemy. I think that the 
world's getting smaller all the time, and as a

15:42.625 --> 15:53.420
matter of fact, space is no longer a mystery. And 
space is no longer that vast area. We're in it every

15:56.384 --> 15:57.206
day.

16:00.430 --> 16:05.217
So therefore, the families of nations around the 
world are just inevitably going to be drawn closer

16:05.500 --> 16:09.304
and closer. Maybe this is a hope for settling some 
of our problems, because we are going to become

16:09.665 --> 16:16.753
more dependent on each other. Look how dependent, 
for example, we are today on the Arabian nations,

16:16.773 --> 16:24.242
particularly for oil, for our energy. The 
strategic materials we talk about in the

16:25.724 --> 16:35.355
military, particularly metals, we're more 
dependent for that on foreign nations than we are

16:35.909 --> 16:38.631
for oil in Arabia.

16:42.495 --> 16:49.301
We can no longer find all the strength we need from 
within the United States, you know. So I think that

16:49.321 --> 17:04.414
the Russians are pretty much in the same fix in many 
ways, and so I don't want to give the impression

16:49.321 --> 17:04.414
that I'm a doomsday predictor. things have a real 
good chance of getting better but we better take

17:04.985 --> 17:34.722
care of our homework in our international 
relations and I don't think that we're really and I

17:04.985 --> 17:34.722
don't know what the heck I can do about it but I don't 
think that we're really equipped to do that and I

17:04.985 --> 17:34.722
think you know I see the Pentagon reorganized 
every time we get a new Secretary of Defense and the

17:04.985 --> 17:34.722
Army reorganized every time we get a new Chief of 
Staff

17:37.199 --> 17:39.642
State Department significantly reorganized. 
But while we're worrying about Poland,

17:40.803 --> 17:58.666
Afghanistan, and Russia, and what's going to 
happen to the French socialist government, for

17:40.803 --> 17:58.666
example, we're not really, again, we're guilty of 
not really paying attention to the Western

17:40.803 --> 17:58.666
Hemisphere. And I'm very disturbed about what's 
happening in Central America. And of course, I've

18:06.697 --> 18:12.885
had a particular interest in Latin America ever 
since I served in Venezuela and have kept some

18:06.697 --> 18:12.885
focus on it. And we have neglected not only the 
security aspects of Latin America, but we've

18:13.686 --> 18:25.682
taken for granted so long the economic benefits we 
get there that those become more endangered. And I

18:26.924 --> 18:32.892
would just simply like to see us with a better 
capability to handle our international

18:26.924 --> 18:32.892
responsibilities. I don't think we handle them. 
I'm going to write somebody about that. I don't

18:37.133 --> 18:38.034
know who. I've met General Haig and know him 
slightly, but I don't know him well enough to write

18:39.436 --> 18:44.542
a dear Al. Here's my critique. But I did want to 
mention that

18:47.446 --> 18:56.818
South America, Latin America, is a particular 
concern to me.

19:05.607 --> 19:33.623
this is something that I you know in my I'm now in 
isolation here I still think about and then of

19:05.607 --> 19:33.623
course we have discussed the something very close 
to me and that is the

19:05.607 --> 19:33.623
the army itself so I guess we've just about hit all 
the bases well if you think of anything more open we

19:05.607 --> 19:33.623
can just add When you send me that transcript, I'll 
probably have more things to say. Thank you very

19:38.494 --> 19:40.322
much, General Becker.
