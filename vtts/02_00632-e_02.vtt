WEBVTT

00:07.473 --> 00:13.243
We're now looking into salinity power, a thing 
that's very little recognized. For instance,

00:13.925 --> 00:27.208
when that brine flows into the Colorado River and 
it's diluted, the free energy is as though that

00:13.925 --> 00:27.208
brine has fallen down a 7,000-foot dam. 
7,000-foot dam. That's high energy density. If

00:32.633 --> 00:37.119
you're going to let it get in the Colorado anyway, 
why, you might as well get the power out of it. Now,

00:37.459 --> 00:43.367
that's kind of a foolish thing, because if you're 
going to dam it up, why, you might as well shoot it in

00:37.459 --> 00:43.367
the Gulf and get the power out of it. But this is 
something we're now working on, which is salinity

00:43.427 --> 00:48.914
power. It's a totally invisible sort of power. But 
every little agricultural drainage ditch that's

00:53.300 --> 01:00.970
going into the Great Salt Lake, for instance, has a 
megawatt per cubic foot per second. is the free

01:02.097 --> 01:05.000
energy of that going into the Great Salt Lake. It's 
a high. Of all the natural forms of energy, it's

01:06.341 --> 01:21.135
certainly the most concentrated, the natural 
forms of energy of that sort of level, not coal or

01:06.341 --> 01:21.135
oil or

01:06.341 --> 01:21.135
lightning, of course. And so we're not going to 
overlook it. And we're trying to see it's a strange

01:24.498 --> 01:29.843
sort of energy because of the curiosities of 
saltwater. But that's a whole other subject. I

01:36.156 --> 01:37.698
don't know whether you want to go into it or not. No, 
I want to know one thing now. Why is saltwater...

01:42.585 --> 01:43.967
Only one thing? Well, I know a lot, but I want to know 
one thing immediately. Why is saltwater energy

01:46.090 --> 01:50.376
differently construed than freshwater energy? 
Oh, well, no, you've got me wrong. Okay. If you

01:53.500 --> 01:55.543
take, say, brine... and mix it with salt water, or 
with fresh water. But you could mix it with sea

02:00.046 --> 02:02.729
water, because it's so much more concentrated. If 
you separated them by a semipermeable membrane,

02:03.990 --> 02:16.384
osmotic membrane, and allowed this to go to 
equilibrium, the fresh water would go into this

02:03.990 --> 02:16.384
brine. And if you allowed this to take place 
without much dilution, it would raise the brine

02:17.405 --> 02:24.653
7,000 feet. You could now pour it off up there and 
run a pelton wheel with it or something and

02:25.088 --> 02:29.394
generate energy. Well, this is a real expression 
of the free energy. The peculiarity about the

02:33.781 --> 02:42.874
thing is that if you release that much energy in a 
reaction like putting brine with fresh water

02:33.781 --> 02:42.874
together, you would expect it to heat up. If you 
release that much energy, the energy's got to go

02:44.896 --> 02:47.280
somewhere. You'd expect it to heat up, but it 
doesn't. The temperature changes essentially

02:49.984 --> 02:52.227
nothing. And that's because of the peculiarities 
of the substance sodium chloride. Sodium

02:57.373 --> 02:59.656
chloride has a strange property. Almost nothing 
else has it. And that is that it produces

03:02.841 --> 03:14.697
disorder in the water at just about the rate it 
releases energy. So it all goes into what's called

03:15.758 --> 03:20.745
entropy.

03:21.215 --> 03:33.168
If the Great Salt Lake had been anything other than 
sodium chloride, let's say it had been magnesium

03:21.215 --> 03:33.168
sulfate, people on their inner tubes floating 
down the little streams in the Great Salt Lake

03:21.215 --> 03:33.168
would have burned their rears off. Or if it had been 
something else, ammonium nitrate, God forbid, or

03:33.188 --> 03:39.956
ammonium sulfate. Yeah, ammonium sulfate. 
They'd have frozen their rears. There'd have been

03:42.058 --> 03:45.482
big temperature changes when that fresh water 
flowed in. Nobody would ever doubt that there was

03:45.823 --> 03:47.965
plenty of energy. But because sodium chloride is 
the dominant ion, there's a dominant molecule in

03:48.299 --> 04:03.234
there, electrolyte in there, what happens is that 
the energy is soaked up into increasing heat

03:48.299 --> 04:03.234
capacity at just the rate it's made. And so it 
doesn't appear as temperature. It's there,

04:07.538 --> 04:10.261
perfectly well, in a different form. All we have to 
do is learn how to utilize it. It's a tremendous

04:12.303 --> 04:13.184
lot. You see, all of the Midwest is underlain by 
brines, as you may know. And there's also Texas, as

04:18.337 --> 04:23.521
God knows, your oil wells. When do they quit 
drilling? When they hit the bottom. And that all is

04:27.144 --> 04:33.270
a power source, every bit of it, and by no means an 
inconsiderable one.

04:40.596 --> 04:47.922
Did you first become interested in the issue of 
food and food expansion through the ocean when you

04:40.596 --> 04:47.922
were in Pakistan? No, I've always been more or 
less, I've been interested in him for a long time,

04:47.986 --> 04:54.055
yeah. That was 62, I think. Right. Now, when did you 
interview Ravel? Oh, over the July the 4th

04:58.822 --> 05:01.886
weekend. You did, huh? Yeah. Isn't he an 
interesting guy, a great guy at his home? Yeah.

05:06.833 --> 05:06.974
Yeah. No, what I want to know is what, as a man 
involved in oceans, looking and has been looking

05:08.276 --> 05:16.187
at a long time at things like, food production, 
mariculture, what was the impact upon you

05:16.403 --> 05:23.351
psychologically in an underdeveloped country 
for the first time like Pakistan? Well, that

05:25.634 --> 05:28.858
wasn't exactly the first time I'd been in that 
country.

05:34.485 --> 05:40.132
Well,

05:34.485 --> 05:40.132
your reaction to a country like that, of course, is 
very complicated. And one can spend hours talking

05:40.532 --> 05:46.039
about that one subject. A little peculiar, isn't 
it? There is so much misery, there's so much

05:53.045 --> 05:58.891
poverty, and people accept it so well. The most 
frightening thing, probably, about India and

05:59.311 --> 06:05.938
Pakistan is how fast you can get used to it. I mean, 
you shouldn't be able to get used to it. You should

06:09.481 --> 06:13.625
not be able to get used to it. Yet, you know, these 
people are not without their total

06:17.170 --> 06:19.593
disadvantages. I mean, without all advantages in 
some way. You look at all the crippled people in

06:24.761 --> 06:27.585
that country, and the defective people. You see 
them on the streets, and you're horrified by them.

06:30.629 --> 06:32.732
What do we do with our defective people in the 
United States? We hide them. They have a hell of a

06:34.154 --> 06:35.676
poor time, don't they? They're old people, the old 
crippled people, the insane people. They're all

06:38.520 --> 06:39.481
hidden somewhere. I mean, even people just with 
bad facial scars. They're hidden. That country,

06:44.468 --> 06:45.169
they're Those people, at any rate, have a better 
time, don't they? They're with society. And those

06:50.020 --> 06:52.003
are kind of interesting points, it seems to me. The 
United States has such a culture of perfection,

06:53.985 --> 06:57.469
you see. You really can't even be bald, much less 
have your nose missing or a disfiguration, a

06:57.489 --> 07:09.183
crippled arm or something. That country, those 
people live a much freer life. So as I say, yeah.

07:15.845 --> 07:21.852
What would our society look like if we really left 
all of our people on the streets and accepted them?

07:22.493 --> 07:23.014
Quite different. And the old people, the old 
crippled people that would be on the streets in

07:25.156 --> 07:34.788
India and Pakistan are hidden away in our country 
and living miserable lives.

07:37.171 --> 07:40.435
As a matter of fact, I was talking to a Texan on the 
airplane just about that the other day. He sure got

07:42.507 --> 07:43.909
a point there. He said, never thought of it. Remind 
me, does this turn your work into a... I've been to

07:55.384 --> 07:59.750
India quite a bit, because my sister lived there 
for 20 years, or 18 years. In India. In what? Well,

08:06.099 --> 08:10.725
her husband was an architect, and she's an artist, 
and they They built buildings and designed

08:11.161 --> 08:17.368
buildings and built schools. They built the 
University of Karachi and the Institute of

08:17.408 --> 08:33.327
Boddistic Studies at

08:17.408 --> 08:33.327
Heavens and Burma, and quite a number of 
structures throughout India. And I used to visit

08:33.347 --> 08:36.991
her occasionally, or visit them. So I was not 
totally unacquainted with that area. okay now in

08:40.760 --> 09:09.012
1968 i have bootstrap core oh yeah that's kind of 
fun and uh a statement of fact are you asking me well

08:40.760 --> 09:09.012
i'm asking you how it came about

08:40.760 --> 09:09.012
well it that was an idea and i i'm not so sure how well 
it's ever going to be utilized but it was an idea of a

08:40.760 --> 09:09.012
car that pulled itself down without these 
tremendous weights that you use for core barrels

09:10.898 --> 09:20.371
and took a long core with a very light core. I think 
it's the only core that ever took a core that

09:20.391 --> 09:26.620
weighed much more than the device itself. And it's 
just an interesting configuration of a core, it

09:26.680 --> 09:36.754
seems to me, that is not without merit.

09:38.033 --> 09:45.981
Taking very deep, very long cores to the ocean 
bottom with simple equipment so that you don't

09:38.033 --> 09:45.981
have to have these immense winches. Very large 
cores.

09:51.848 --> 09:59.095
OK. OK. Now, it seems to me that in more recent years 
you've been- I'd like your wife's opinion on that.

09:59.336 --> 10:01.718
I'll write you and tell you as a matter of fact. All 
right. It appears that in recent years you've

10:02.259 --> 10:06.743
published more on marine biology problems. Yeah. 
Okay. Is there any, such as fisheries and

10:08.318 --> 10:11.402
productivity? That was reading my question about 
Pakistan. Why a turn in this direction? Well, I

10:17.471 --> 10:19.253
don't think it's a turn, exactly. It's a 
culmination of some ideas that I've been working

10:19.333 --> 10:23.599
on for quite a few years. Different theories, 
alternate theories of food webs, how they're put

10:26.223 --> 10:30.889
together. The marine biologist, are you on? Yes. 
The marine biologist suffers from I think the

10:37.720 --> 10:42.465
delusion that he can see everything that goes 
forth, that goes on in the ocean. Given enough

10:43.126 --> 10:50.773
plankton nets, enough ships, enough graduate 
students in one thing or another, he can trace what

10:43.126 --> 10:50.773
happens to the food material in the ocean. I think 
that's totally a delusion. You can't do it. The

10:56.159 --> 10:59.743
food web is far too complicated. Just take the 
curious case of reproductive products.

11:06.526 --> 11:15.277
Everything, every adult creature in the ocean is 
throwing out eggs and sperm, which account for

11:06.526 --> 11:15.277
maybe 50% of the potential growth of that 
population. And it's all invisibly flowing down

11:15.798 --> 11:18.721
into the food web. You see, we're so misled by our 
terrestrial experience. We think that the

11:23.247 --> 11:30.536
immediate effect of reproduction is to add to the 
adult stocks by direct transfer of biomass. That

11:30.817 --> 11:32.679
is, a cow has a calf. The calf is a large proportion 
of an adult. It feeds on paternal sources. It

11:37.448 --> 11:44.179
immediately then, after it has weaned, feeds on 
the same source that the adults feed on and adds to

11:37.448 --> 11:44.179
the adult biomass. The ocean is a totally 
different situation, except for the marine

11:46.022 --> 11:49.848
mammals and some sharks. This isn't the way to do 
this at all. The reproductive products are

11:54.255 --> 11:57.079
subtracted from the adult biomass. The eggs are 
pulled out of the adult biomass. The amount of

12:00.965 --> 12:02.908
survival of that material that comes back to the 
adult is absolutely zero. The egg that survives

12:07.020 --> 12:11.486
down here goes through the larval form, juvenile 
form, and finally becomes an adult. The survival

12:12.127 --> 12:13.689
of that egg is zero. So we forget that the ocean is in 
many respects opposed, opposite, than the land.

12:23.083 --> 12:32.997
Reproductive products, which are a major tax on 
all creatures, is not added to the adult biomass in

12:23.083 --> 12:32.997
the ocean, but subtracted from it. And I think we 
need these kinds of totally different

12:33.584 --> 12:36.668
viewpoints. And we need to formalize them in some 
way. And that's what I've been doing the last few

12:38.950 --> 12:42.674
years. You see, we're much misled by the fact that 
we're terrestrial creatures. The ocean is, to a

12:50.724 --> 13:00.155
great extent, a foreign and dimly understood 
system. And the life in it is differently adapted.

13:03.453 --> 13:04.775
We forget those differences. We tend to treat it 
like a rare land ecology. Is it fair to say that

13:11.663 --> 13:17.450
you're more optimistic about food production in 
the oceans than your colleagues? I wouldn't speak

13:18.612 --> 13:25.200
for my colleagues, but I'm quite optimistic about 
food production in the ocean, yes. I think we've

13:25.220 --> 13:27.944
got to understand that we have to act rationally. I 
don't think we can act this sort of a way of, for

13:28.765 --> 13:32.329
instance, passing a law that we must protect the 
porpoises, we have to first understand what's the

13:34.216 --> 13:41.865
relationship between porpoises and tuna. It may 
be in the 30 or 40 years of intensive tuna fishery

13:41.945 --> 13:48.052
that we've greatly stimulated the porpoise. It 
may be there in all or out of proportion. It's

13:50.154 --> 13:57.062
marvelous to me that tuna can survive in 
competition of the porpoise, this profligate,

13:50.154 --> 13:57.062
warm-blooded animal inhabiting the ocean. If 
you've ever seen a school of porpoises sweep

13:57.082 --> 14:02.248
through a gulf, it's incredible. frothing water 
where they clean everything out as they go. Now,

14:07.494 --> 14:24.272
isn't it funny that we should, because of soft 
hearts or something, should now have passed a law

14:07.494 --> 14:24.272
that says, ah, we must do this thing, which may be 
the worst possible tactic, is to pull the tuna out

14:07.494 --> 14:24.272
without hurting the porpoise, which are in direct 
competition with one another. Or do we know

14:24.312 --> 14:26.174
whether they're in direct competition? Do we know 
that 40 years of tuna fishery has stimulated the

14:26.694 --> 14:30.278
porpoise or not? Do we know that they're in 
abnormal abundance or normal abundance? We don't

14:33.493 --> 14:33.913
know. We just pass a law that says you've got to 
protect the porpoise. That may really extinguish

14:37.178 --> 14:45.189
the tuna fishery.

14:45.209 --> 14:51.478
You see, all our marine fisheries are conducted in 
this way that stimulate the unwanted species. We

14:53.600 --> 14:54.802
have no use for the porpoise. Even the Japanese can 
hardly use it. And By law, now, we make a technique

15:00.110 --> 15:05.895
that reduces the wanted species and increases the 
unwanted species. I went up to British Columbia

15:07.577 --> 15:19.908
not long ago, and here they have radio advisories 
to the salmon fishery about where you can fish

15:07.577 --> 15:19.908
without getting your net full of dogfish. Now, 
this is the same technique as the boy that learns

15:21.029 --> 15:27.255
how to catch the trout out of the pond without 
catching a sucker, isn't he? He increases the

15:27.275 --> 15:29.357
suckers and decreases the trout. Now, here's a 
whole organization to decrease the salmon and

15:30.434 --> 15:35.881
increase the dogfish.

15:40.027 --> 15:42.671
You see, you've got to take the weeds. The 
fisheries in the world are conducted like a blind

15:43.252 --> 15:55.488
man who can't see the weeds in his garden and is 
always pulling up the corn instead of the weeds and

15:43.252 --> 15:55.488
then wondering why he's got less and less corn each 
year.

15:59.534 --> 15:59.614
Hmm. So are you suggesting, then, that more study 
ought to be done? Well, I'm just trying to point out

16:02.666 --> 16:12.756
these viewpoints, which are different than the 
conventional, the traditional way in which

16:02.666 --> 16:12.756
people have gone to look at these things. Many 
people say that fishing is already an optimum,

16:12.776 --> 16:20.444
that the ocean cannot produce many more 
fisheries, that fishing is a very inefficient

16:12.776 --> 16:20.444
way. It depends on what level you do this, of 
course, doesn't it? And what level you conduct

16:25.048 --> 16:27.711
your fisheries. We're conducting, if you were to 
look at it in terrestrial terms, we're conducting

16:28.298 --> 16:36.385
our fisheries now as though we were trying to feed 
the human race on tigers. It just takes too

16:37.366 --> 16:40.709
god-amany cows to feed the tigers, doesn't it? 
Actually, we're probably even higher than that.

16:42.070 --> 16:43.571
Whatever eats tigers, I've forgotten. Is there 
anything?

16:47.435 --> 16:49.176
We're conducting our fisheries at that level.

16:52.820 --> 16:56.803
No tribe in its right mind ever tried to feed itself 
on tigers. It took too many deer or buffalo or

16:57.847 --> 17:03.233
whatever it was. So the closer we get down to things 
like the Anchoveta fishery and Peru and so forth,

17:03.253 --> 17:09.780
the larger and larger. And the more we go towards 
the juveniles, the mortality of these things in

17:09.800 --> 17:22.234
the ocean is so great that probably we are 
justified in taking juveniles. But the thing we do

17:22.254 --> 17:27.280
have to do is see what the effects of our fishery are 
on the competitors. see we're always stimulating

17:27.901 --> 17:52.002
we're always stimulating the competitors of what 
we want to catch that those kind of things have to be

17:27.901 --> 17:52.002
pointed out yet the law is so indurate that there's 
really no way to have any flexibility you see there

17:27.901 --> 17:52.002
is no way to set up a commercial fishery that really 
trims and controls a fishery in multi-species

17:52.184 --> 17:55.988
modes that it should. There's no theory to handle 
it. I tried to develop a theory, and it looks like it

17:57.630 --> 18:06.781
might make some sense.

18:06.801 --> 18:12.928
What was Joint Task Force Number One, to whom you 
submitted numerous secret reports? That was the

18:13.228 --> 18:17.693
Joint Task Force Bikini Hunt. First test. Abel and 
Baker test. Now, much of the material you

18:22.492 --> 18:30.582
published from 45 to 47 from Berkeley was related 
to the physical surveillances of beaches along

18:22.492 --> 18:30.582
the Pacific. Was this defense information for 
amphibious landings primarily? Well, it was more

18:34.767 --> 18:37.170
general than that. It was trying to understand the 
nature of beaches and amphibious landings

18:37.190 --> 18:47.723
wherever it was, not defending the Pacific coast 
against amphibious landings, no, but rather

18:37.190 --> 18:47.723
guarding our own amphibious landings. Could you 
describe any work that you did on sea mines that's

18:48.715 --> 18:53.039
no longer classified? What were you? Oh, boy.

18:59.386 --> 18:59.766
Let's see. Can I come up with that?

19:08.595 --> 19:16.123
Well, as I said very early, there's quite a bit I 
can't certainly still classify. quite different

19:17.673 --> 19:44.406
ideas about sea mines

19:17.673 --> 19:44.406
one thing i can say is i took almost a year off back in 
1952 or so 53 maybe to study landmines uh under the

19:17.673 --> 19:44.406
theory that landmine is essentially the same kind 
of a weapon as a sea mine except it has the ability to

19:17.673 --> 19:44.406
evolve much more rapidly every Texas farmer that 
gets into the army thinks he can go out and play

19:44.993 --> 19:54.627
around with some primacord and explosives and 
develop a new land mine, and nobody in their right

19:44.993 --> 19:54.627
mind fiddles around with a sea mine. There you're 
talking about you're on a ship. You can't possibly

20:00.456 --> 20:08.267
screw around being innovative with 300 pounds of 
TNT.

20:09.158 --> 20:13.862
Everybody feels they know something about 
landmines, and they can make innovation. And

20:13.982 --> 20:17.165
there are some tremendous innovations in 
landmines. In fact, they'd have near beat us in

20:17.846 --> 20:27.435
Korea and in

20:17.846 --> 20:27.435
Vietnam also. The innovations were tremendous. 
What I was trying to see was, does this evolution of

20:31.579 --> 20:38.305
landmines have a forecasting ability on the 
evolution of sea mines are some of these

20:38.521 --> 20:54.783
technologies that were developed and which were 
so extremely difficult to combat that were

20:38.521 --> 20:54.783
developed with land mines by small-scale 
innovation transferable to sea mines. I thought

20:55.104 --> 20:58.268
that was a reasonably good contribution I made on 
that subject. And here you have an evolutionary

20:59.770 --> 21:06.199
sequence that you can begin to understand and how 
what the steps have been between measures and

21:07.647 --> 21:16.598
countermeasures and counter-countermeasures 
and so forth, to see if those were transferable

21:07.647 --> 21:16.598
into the ocean, and indeed they are. Is nuclear 
blasting to form harbors and channels still a

21:18.641 --> 21:23.046
feasible idea? Oh, sure. The Russians have been 
doing it, of course. It's not a feasible idea for

21:31.176 --> 21:33.439
the United States to do. I think the French might do 
it. to make harbors. Those great harbors of

21:41.668 --> 21:48.594
Bikini, I rode around in one of them two weeks after 
the blast. Beautiful, vast blue harbors that make

21:50.636 --> 21:58.504
supertankers a reality. Bring in a 200-foot draft 
ship, and it can be made like that. But the whole

22:05.771 --> 22:07.152
plowshare program, was conducted with such 
insensitivity, I think, that it does not become a

22:08.043 --> 22:17.514
possibility for the United States to proceed in 
any way. You know, they were going to blast a

22:18.275 --> 22:32.131
channel through the Sierra Nevadas to let the smog 
out of Los Angeles, or start out with blasting a new

22:18.275 --> 22:32.131
sea level canal through Panama. Things that 
scared people to death. Were you involved, by the

22:35.633 --> 22:39.078
way, with that plan to open up a new Panama Canal? To 
some extent, yeah. Did you think it were a feasible

22:41.522 --> 22:43.505
idea? From

22:43.525 --> 22:48.032
an engineering standpoint? Yeah, from an 
engineering standpoint. Of course. From an

22:52.579 --> 22:54.742
engineering standpoint. From a social 
engineering standpoint, it was idiocy.

23:00.551 --> 23:02.914
You've got to start out small or something like 
that. You know what I wanted to do? I want to take my

23:05.198 --> 23:13.892
family and go out to Bikini and live around the 
edges of the crater out there and take some

23:05.198 --> 23:13.892
National Geographic type articles living on the 
lip of a nuclear crater. This great mile and a half

23:14.353 --> 23:25.570
harbor, 300 feet deep, with new fish coming in, new 
corals, new development in one thing or another.

23:25.591 --> 23:26.532
That was kind of the way. that one wanted to feed 
this into the social system. A National

23:31.393 --> 23:39.801
Geographic harbor of a family of scientists went 
out and lived on the lips of a bikini crater. That

23:39.821 --> 23:41.323
would have made sense to me. To me, too. What 
happened to that idea? I didn't get anywhere with

23:43.104 --> 23:44.726
it.

23:49.851 --> 23:52.414
In fact, some of my best writing is undoubtedly in 
proposals. Never got funded. My most persuasive,

23:57.460 --> 24:03.607
my most thoughtful, my most penetrating writing 
in Boston, supposedly.

24:06.650 --> 24:08.833
What is the future of deep-sea ports? Open-sea 
ports? Open-sea ports. Well, of course, as far as

24:12.196 --> 24:19.284
petroleum and liquid fuels and things like that, 
it's gigantic as far as it's all going to be

24:12.196 --> 24:19.284
conducted. Ships are going to be built at sea, are 
being built at sea, assembled at sea at any rate,

24:19.604 --> 24:25.611
and they're never going to touch shore. uh you 
consider this inevitable it's not only

24:26.249 --> 24:48.510
inevitable it's here it uh what about the idea of 
the proposed sea dock in the gulf i don't know

24:26.249 --> 24:48.510
anything about the sea dock in the gulf well the 
concept of is that a physician a hospital hospital

24:26.249 --> 24:48.510
so in other words that you see Is it fair to say that 
you see these docks being built for the transport

24:49.250 --> 24:54.498
of oil in places like the Gulf here? I don't know if 
they're going to be docks. They're going to be

24:56.000 --> 24:59.625
monobullies of some sort, I think. Why should they 
be docks? But I see no reason. Well, one thing I

25:02.990 --> 25:04.393
really don't understand. You can perhaps 
elucidate me. What is the tremendous virtue of a

25:07.758 --> 25:10.361
free port? I mean, look at Hong Kong. Well, of 
course, now, it's a special case because it's an

25:13.065 --> 25:18.193
outlet of goods from mainland China. But free 
ports around the world prosper tremendously.

25:23.125 --> 25:25.489
What happens if you have a free port right in the 
middle of the ocean somewhere? All the ships have

25:25.609 --> 25:27.271
to come in and trade goods. You can have a nuclear 
power plant there to run it. It's a big enclosed

25:30.315 --> 25:31.536
thing. You can have some fisheries, all kinds of 
things you can do that would not be accepted in

25:32.598 --> 25:46.476
coastal waters, like the release of fisheries 
waste and so on, nuisance level of nuclear waste.

25:47.232 --> 25:48.794
And you can have a free port. Is there virtue in 
having just a free port out in the middle of the

25:48.814 --> 25:53.780
ocean somewhere where people can trade without 
tax?

25:56.503 --> 25:56.923
What is it? I'm not sure countries can move any 
longer to free trade. Say what? I'm not sure

26:02.430 --> 26:04.832
countries can move any longer to free trade. They 
can. I'm not sure that's economically feasible

26:05.693 --> 26:08.036
for countries. Well, very few of them have. Well, 
export limits are much fewer than import limits.

26:14.143 --> 26:15.805
So in principle, you can. you can have some sort of 
free trade in the middle of the sea. Is this an

26:22.500 --> 26:23.641
idiotic idea? No. You don't think so? No. What 
about Spillhouse's cities on the sea? Well, I

26:30.011 --> 26:32.635
think that's all fun. And John Craven, too, of 
course, is working on this. That's all great fun. I

26:36.781 --> 26:38.183
don't know why people want to live there. I can 
count a billion places where you could sit down in

26:38.223 --> 26:44.593
Los Angeles and never find it again, but Most of the 
world is uninhabited, as you well know. It's only

26:47.488 --> 26:54.600
the coastal strips that is covered over by this 
incrustation of human beings.
