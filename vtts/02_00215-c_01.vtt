WEBVTT

00:03.659 --> 00:05.421
probably the closest to the cadets.

00:06.162 --> 00:12.731
And over a period of time, you know, they'd been maybe advisor for a couple of years, and they knew these cadets.

00:12.751 --> 00:14.834
Some of them, you know, they'd known them since they were freshmen.

00:14.874 --> 00:20.182
So that was the main counseling system that we had.

00:20.903 --> 00:24.187
Was Malin one of the junior officers?

00:24.227 --> 00:24.928
Malin Sutherland?

00:25.168 --> 00:25.589
No.

00:25.609 --> 00:25.949
Junior?

00:26.250 --> 00:26.430
No.

00:26.811 --> 00:27.512
Was he back?

00:27.832 --> 00:30.055
Well, Malin was the,

00:30.507 --> 00:33.950
assistant to Jarvis, I think, for a while.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.232
Then he was assistant to Dr. Sampson.

00:37.934 --> 00:42.378
And then after that, he went over and started working with John Colas.

00:43.338 --> 00:43.519
Okay.

00:43.599 --> 00:44.259
So he was not?

00:44.600 --> 00:45.981
No, he was never in the Trigon.

00:46.401 --> 00:49.424
He came in a few years after I left.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.386
This was an interim commandant for a year.

00:53.107 --> 00:59.653
After Burton left and before General Darling came in, he was kind of the interim commandant.

01:01.152 --> 01:08.362
Were there any of these counselors that you would, to whom you would single out as really being ABLE advisors?

01:08.883 --> 01:11.907
Well, one of the best was Bill Faulkner.

01:12.868 --> 01:13.589
Bill Faulkner.

01:13.910 --> 01:15.031
F-A-U-L-K?

01:15.051 --> 01:16.033
N-E-R, yeah.

01:17.395 --> 01:20.459
His son just graduated as a senior over here.

01:20.499 --> 01:25.105
He was killed, he retired from the Army or resigned from the Army.

01:25.165 --> 01:28.510
He was an engineer captain and went to work as a

01:29.350 --> 01:34.536
He was kind of a contractor building houses, and then he had to ship his donuts here in Bryan.

01:34.616 --> 01:38.661
And he was a super, super guy.

01:38.681 --> 01:43.908
But he was probably one of the smartest officers that I had during my five years over there.

01:44.649 --> 01:49.735
You know, he was the kind of guy that if you wanted to get something done right and quick, you gave it to him.

01:50.636 --> 01:56.623
And his oldest son just graduated this year with the highest honors, Kuna Sumlata.

01:56.772 --> 02:01.420
And his other son I think will be a sophomore next year.

02:02.662 --> 02:04.445
I think he'll be a sophomore next year.

02:04.565 --> 02:09.233
So he had both of his sons, but he was killed almost several years ago.

02:12.118 --> 02:14.622
All right, we're kind of summarizing now.

02:14.763 --> 02:16.806
Looking back to whom do you want to give

02:17.528 --> 02:19.753
greatest appreciation, gratitude?

02:20.234 --> 02:21.396
Well, that's five years.

02:21.576 --> 02:30.054
I think it would be shared with General Simpson and John Colas because I couldn't say enough good about either one of those guys.

02:30.094 --> 02:30.936
They were tremendous.

02:32.239 --> 02:38.271
And like I said, Simpson was, I was closest to him because I was, I was with him almost every day.

02:39.196 --> 02:42.821
And he never, he backed me on everything I ever wanted to do.

02:43.502 --> 02:57.199
Can you imagine anybody that we could design with a machine if we were godlike where we could have found anybody that would do the task better than either of them?

02:57.219 --> 02:57.860
Oh no, no.

02:57.880 --> 03:01.725
We were really, really blessed during that time.

03:02.366 --> 03:02.867
Who else?

03:02.967 --> 03:03.648
Anybody else?

03:03.768 --> 03:06.992
Any staff members, secretaries?

03:08.390 --> 03:18.125
Well, Don Johnson, he certainly was a great help because they've got about 25 people or at least over in the commandant's office now.

03:18.205 --> 03:19.587
I don't know how many they have.

03:19.608 --> 03:23.333
They've got full colonels and lieutenant colonels and, you know, all retired.

03:23.373 --> 03:27.540
Then they've got secretaries and accountants.

03:28.161 --> 03:32.227
And, of course, they have the housing under them and they have the MPC.

03:32.808 --> 03:36.574
I never had the housing under me, but I worked very closely with those guys.

03:37.162 --> 03:41.809
And, you know, they were almost under my control, but they weren't officially.

03:42.270 --> 03:44.413
If they had about 25, how many did you have?

03:44.913 --> 03:46.195
I had two.

03:47.718 --> 03:48.799
Me and Don Johnson.

03:48.819 --> 03:49.580
That was it.

03:50.241 --> 03:52.164
And anything that was done, we had to do it.

03:52.364 --> 03:55.930
Plus, like I said, a part-time grad assistant.

03:55.950 --> 03:58.914
And we had a couple student workers, but, you know, they were runners.

03:59.875 --> 04:02.359
They didn't help a whole lot.

04:03.605 --> 04:09.835
As you got to the end of your time, what were the closing events?

04:10.336 --> 04:12.540
How did they thank you?

04:12.620 --> 04:18.249
What were the... Well, Burton was, had come in and I'd turned it over to him in August.

04:19.411 --> 04:27.925
I was retiring on the 31st of August, 82, and so we had a, we didn't have a core review because, you know, this was the start of school.

04:28.327 --> 04:32.051
So we didn't want those freshmen marching, but at least they taught them to stand at attention.

04:32.131 --> 04:41.300
So we had a, the core was lined up on the drill field and that's where we had the, you know, my retirement ceremony.

04:42.461 --> 04:48.868
And so, well, that May, was it known that that May was your last?

04:48.888 --> 04:49.488
Oh, yeah.

04:49.508 --> 04:56.015
It was announced sometime in the spring, I think, before school was out that, you know, I'd be retiring.

04:56.155 --> 04:58.317
And what did you do to celebrate retirement?

04:59.933 --> 05:11.033
Well, I was in, the day before I retired, I was out in Lubbock because my third daughter was having a baby.

05:11.895 --> 05:16.684
And the baby was born the night of the 30th.

05:16.704 --> 05:20.170
And we got in the car and we drove from Lubbock

05:20.588 --> 05:27.040
back to College Station because we were having this ceremony the afternoon of the 31st.

05:27.060 --> 05:32.169
Well General Simpson was having a fit because I wasn't in town.

05:32.269 --> 05:35.294
No one could find me and I was up in Lubbock.

05:35.314 --> 05:41.365
And so I got back about early that morning and then I got in bed and went to sleep and about

05:41.699 --> 05:49.790
Eight o'clock the phone started ringing and it was General Simpson and somebody and said, well, he's asleep but he'll be there.

05:50.110 --> 05:52.474
Don't worry, he'll make it.

05:52.494 --> 05:57.861
So I did make it but it was an emotional event but I was so tired.

05:58.021 --> 05:58.241
Sure.

05:58.602 --> 06:04.970
I mean, I was just numb so it didn't get to me like it could have.

06:05.311 --> 06:11.419
Ironically, the grandson that was born will be here next week.

06:11.922 --> 06:14.706
to be a freshman in the Corps of Cadets.

06:14.726 --> 06:19.072
So I always know how long I've been retired by his age.

06:20.374 --> 06:23.839
And he turns 19 at the end of this month.

06:23.859 --> 06:25.161
How good, how good.

06:26.283 --> 06:32.352
All right, have we left any important topics out from those five years?

06:33.173 --> 06:35.256
Oh, I can't, I really can't think of anything.

06:35.276 --> 06:36.938
Pluses, minuses, people?

06:37.379 --> 06:38.200
I can't.

06:38.568 --> 06:40.930
It's kind of hard, you know, after I read this over.

06:41.231 --> 06:44.434
There were no, no fires, no bombings, no.

06:44.874 --> 06:45.755
Well, we had a bombing.

06:46.716 --> 06:48.478
I mean, we had plenty of bombs in the court.

06:48.498 --> 06:49.178
Oh, yeah, yeah.

06:49.198 --> 06:50.019
No, but I mean, no.

06:50.059 --> 06:53.082
And you know, I found out that VMI had the same problem.

06:53.883 --> 07:02.852
And they were, there was a, out in the quadrangle, there was like a, some kind of little gazebo, and they blew that thing up one year.

07:03.072 --> 07:07.056
And so I found out that things that go on here,

07:07.846 --> 07:09.789
go on to those other military schools.

07:10.030 --> 07:14.196
And then Pat Conway wrote two books about the Citadel.

07:14.417 --> 07:17.261
One's called The Boo and the other's Lords of Discipline.

07:18.203 --> 07:22.710
And reading that was almost reading like being the commandant at Texas A&M.

07:22.871 --> 07:26.697
Some of the same things happened with them that had happened here.

07:27.097 --> 07:29.922
So I could really relate to that book.

07:30.374 --> 07:38.266
And I've always thought one of the problems that VMI has is just across the street, directly north.

07:39.147 --> 07:39.848
Washington and Lee.

07:39.908 --> 07:43.994
Washington and Lee, an entirely different kind of school.

07:44.655 --> 07:51.285
And so here I could sit in my dorm or walk out and look at those guys and what they're doing.

07:51.890 --> 07:59.201
for better or for worse, and they don't have, Washington League doesn't have any kind of the discipline.

07:59.702 --> 08:02.366
It's a fine school, but it's very, very, very different.

08:02.386 --> 08:10.078
Well, I took a group of cadets up to VMI, and that was an eye-opener for them.

08:10.098 --> 08:13.864
We went to Washington, D.C., and stayed there at Fort Myer in a VOQ room.

08:14.249 --> 08:18.375
And then we drove over to VMI and that was really an eye opener.

08:18.856 --> 08:20.478
They thought they had it tough down here.

08:20.779 --> 08:21.981
They didn't know what tough was.

08:22.782 --> 08:30.634
And one thing I did, we didn't mention, I took the Ross Volunteers to Washington for Reagan's inauguration.

08:30.654 --> 08:31.996
That was quite an experience.

08:32.016 --> 08:32.356
Describe that.

08:32.897 --> 08:39.166
Well, we flew up on the plane and I had several officers that were action officers.

08:39.227 --> 08:43.513
I had like one transportation officer that got the buses lined up and transportation.

08:43.949 --> 08:53.961
was billeting and another took supply because we had to take the rifles and all that and you had to put them in separate containers to put them aboard the aircraft.

08:54.041 --> 08:58.106
Anyway, we went up and stayed at Bowling Air Force Base.

08:58.887 --> 09:04.894
There was a Boy Scout troop hut there and so there was a major up there who was

09:05.296 --> 09:09.460
and Aggie and was involved with the Boy Scouts and that's how we got to stay in the hut.

09:09.540 --> 09:12.163
And so we had everyone take a bedroll.

09:13.144 --> 09:17.868
And so each cadet took a bedroll and they slept on the floor there and we.

09:18.329 --> 09:19.310
What was the weather like?

09:20.291 --> 09:25.936
The weather wasn't bad when we got up there but then the day of the parade it was really cold.

09:26.377 --> 09:28.359
I mean it was bitter cold.

09:28.379 --> 09:31.442
And we marched in, you know, for Reagan.

09:31.742 --> 09:33.784
Now where were you while they were marching?

09:34.658 --> 09:42.473
Well, we had the buses down at the other end of the parade route, and I had an officer down there to, you know, make sure the buses didn't get away.

09:42.533 --> 09:49.225
And so I was standing there when the parade started off, and I didn't know what I was going to do.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.903
So I decided, well, I would march along with them, but I would march on the curb.

09:53.023 --> 09:54.865
I wasn't out there where I could be seen.

09:54.925 --> 09:56.808
I was marching along the curb where those police were.

09:57.168 --> 09:58.310
Well, I had a clipboard.

09:58.410 --> 10:02.516
And see, a lot of times if you have a clipboard, you can look important.

10:03.457 --> 10:09.205
And so I had that clipboard, and I just marched along with the clipboard, and I was never stopped.

10:09.225 --> 10:16.815
And I went up to the inauguration platform where Reagan and all those people were, and

10:17.200 --> 10:32.622
You know, I didn't know whether I could go in front of that or not, and the guards were there and Secret Service and everybody, and I said, I'm with this group, and I just marched on and marched right underneath the stand where the President and all those people were, and marched right on down the street.

10:33.584 --> 10:38.010
So I essentially marched in the parade, but I wasn't out where I could be seen.

10:38.210 --> 10:39.532
And no problems?

10:39.752 --> 10:41.575
No, no problems.

10:41.655 --> 10:42.556
Oh, that's marvelous.

10:42.616 --> 10:43.137
That's marvelous.

10:43.157 --> 10:44.219
No, we took all of them.

10:44.519 --> 10:47.604
You know, it was a pretty good clean-cut group of young men.

10:47.664 --> 10:49.566
We took them up there and had no problem.

10:50.768 --> 10:55.936
All right, looking back on those five years, is there a happiest moment?

10:57.258 --> 11:04.248
Oh, there were a lot of happy moments, but I can't think of any, you know, anything that strikes me right now.

11:04.788 --> 11:07.272
Anything in hindsight you wish you had done that you didn't?

11:09.395 --> 11:10.696
I don't, I don't think so.

11:11.177 --> 11:15.121
And again, play consultant.

11:16.263 --> 11:24.812
And like the other day, any advice, counsel to the Corps leadership, commandants of the future?

11:27.095 --> 11:29.998
I think they're doing, they're doing all they can do.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.462
And you know, it looks like to me that the Corps is in pretty good shape.

11:34.133 --> 11:41.803
And they've got a commandant now that, you know, really is an outstanding, outstanding general and outstanding officer.

11:42.044 --> 11:45.589
And I wouldn't, I wouldn't attempt to give them any advice.

11:48.833 --> 11:55.502
And so what feelings do you have about, in your heart about those years as a, as the commandant?

11:55.522 --> 11:59.568
Oh, I'm proud that I, you know, of having been the commandant.

11:59.588 --> 12:02.031
I think it was kind of the, you know,

12:02.872 --> 12:05.220
It kind of capped off my military career.

12:06.706 --> 12:08.091
I wouldn't trade for it.

12:08.532 --> 12:09.155
It was wonderful.

12:10.419 --> 12:11.262
That's quite worth it.
