WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:09.716
What facilities were there across the tracks then 
for this physical training? Nothing except the

00:09.736 --> 00:18.124
road, and down there there was an animal husbandry 
thing, which later on I'd go visit and see them

00:09.736 --> 00:18.124
doing artificial insemination. Toward the 
north? Toward the north, yes. There was one

00:20.426 --> 00:23.409
building over there, there was a farmhouse. We'd 
run down to the farmhouse in the corner there,

00:24.090 --> 00:31.877
about where

00:24.090 --> 00:31.877
that... shelter is for Olsen Field, somewhere in 
that area. And basically around Olsen Field, back

00:36.332 --> 00:39.756
down to Mileshamton. And they told us they were 
going to grade us on the time we did it in. And so you

00:43.540 --> 00:48.866
really, where you were fat, if you were not fat, it 
doesn't make any difference. They're going to

00:48.887 --> 00:50.649
grade you on that. They didn't do it, but they set 
the thermos with it. So you'd be busy till 4 o'clock

00:55.014 --> 00:57.737
or so. Yeah. Well, and then the afternoon, most of 
the time, we'd play intramural sports. Mm-hmm. It

01:02.452 --> 01:05.776
kept us busy. I mean, there was very little leisure 
time.

01:12.224 --> 01:12.705
I enjoyed it. Alright, then back to the room, clean 
up, fall out, march to evening chow. Yeah, evening

01:18.672 --> 01:19.913
chow. We'd come back and we had to study with the 
door open and sit at our desk and have our head down

01:19.933 --> 01:27.102
at a book. So we developed a knack of sleeping in 
that position. Describe your room. Oh, room. You

01:34.120 --> 01:45.275
could not have no carpet, nothing on the walls, one 
picture of somebody, mother and father,

01:34.120 --> 01:45.275
girlfriend, one picture. Very Spartan. And at 
that time, I began to think of A&M and Sparta to

01:48.379 --> 01:56.630
Texas University, Athens. I mean, I was that mold. 
I was a typical Aggie. I thought about it in many

02:01.058 --> 02:06.144
ways, and so I thought we were smarter than they 
were. We lived a smarter life. How long did it take

02:08.086 --> 02:15.715
you and your fish buddies to start trying some kind 
of pranks or tricks on the upperclassmen? It would

02:15.975 --> 02:20.901
probably have been close to a semester. Float out, 
take a box of scabs, which were corn flakes, soak

02:22.102 --> 02:31.032
them in a bucket of water all day, and then have a 
great joy of throwing them into somebody's bed

02:31.535 --> 02:40.807
with them in the middle of the night and running 
from the campus cops, the KKs, and jumping in bed,

02:31.535 --> 02:40.807
and they're chasing you. It's laying there in one 
of the flashlights, and you're pretending you're

02:41.528 --> 02:45.654
asleep and getting away with it. Great joy, great 
thrill. Yeah, if anybody got caught, what kind of

02:48.618 --> 02:54.606
punishment did they get from the upper class? The 
upper class, yeah, well, they'd probably get

02:54.646 --> 02:56.828
their tails beat. With what kind of a paddle? Uh... 
probably a shaved-down baseball bat or softball

03:00.661 --> 03:04.227
bat. Do you remember ever getting a paddle? I don't 
remember. As I said, I lived a very protective life

03:07.913 --> 03:22.737
somehow, being, A, not giving anybody a hard time, 
not wising off to anybody, and, B, having the

03:07.913 --> 03:22.737
protection of Mr. Bildevich. There were some 
things I could stick in there. Like Mr. Spears came

03:25.866 --> 03:40.601
in one time about 2 o'clock in the morning and woke 
me up and said his girlfriend was coming in the next

03:25.866 --> 03:40.601
morning at 7 o'clock, and I had to get him up at 6 
o'clock and sort of go down and beat the train for

03:25.866 --> 03:40.601
the girl. And I didn't wake up sufficient. I did so 
long. I mean, he just woke me up and told me, and my

03:44.745 --> 03:49.230
head hit the thing, and I was gone. The next day he 
saw me. He said, who's 40? I thought I told you to get

03:53.260 --> 03:54.441
me up. I don't remember if you did, but I just, I did 
not do it deliberately and everything else, but I

03:56.304 --> 04:06.216
mean, I was just sound asleep when he woke me up, you 
know, back to sleep. When he turned around and

04:06.577 --> 04:11.583
turned his heel, I was back sound asleep and 
totally escaped. Did he give you any punishment?

04:14.567 --> 04:17.390
No, he did not. Where did you and your buddies... go 
if you had some spare time during the day, just to go

04:20.260 --> 04:28.888
to relax, to... Why did you go? What did you do over 
there? Read the newspapers. I did. They

04:33.513 --> 04:39.719
had newspapers from all over the state. If anybody 
wasn't eager to sit there and read them. Now, I

04:41.441 --> 04:45.885
don't want to transpose myself into my coming back 
to the Marines. That's difficult.

04:50.230 --> 04:56.436
Mostly, if we didn't play in New York, we'd go out 
and do pickup athletic games, you know, touch

04:50.230 --> 04:56.436
football. Where, physically, where would y'all 
play those games? There were all kinds of empty

05:00.360 --> 05:02.623
spaces around the dorms, yeah. They were locked, 
they were out in the middle of what now they call the

05:03.263 --> 05:07.688
quad, middle of the new area. There were a drill 
field all over. I mean, just, there was never any,

05:11.812 --> 05:14.755
all right. In dorm, what do we call dorm 13, 14, 16 in 
that area. There was empty space in between them

05:20.603 --> 05:22.526
there. There were many faculty and staff houses on 
campus then, weren't there? Oh, yes. That's

05:29.013 --> 05:31.356
another thing that caught me. Joe Falk had a house 
just about where Kane Hall is in that area. And my

05:38.525 --> 05:44.011
parents and other CCC people would come to 
football games. And you have open houses pretty

05:44.031 --> 05:46.734
much. And all these old friends would come in there 
and see each other Dr. Munson was one of them that

05:49.512 --> 05:52.177
they knew, too. He had been at CCCU. He was an 
educational advisor or something. I don't know

05:56.105 --> 05:58.811
what he had done there, but my dad knew him pretty 
well. And I don't know how, I don't know, but they

05:59.632 --> 06:03.660
would all come in there. And as a kid, I thought, 
this is the life. This is the most beautiful life

06:08.750 --> 06:11.854
that I can imagine. Come in here and see all your 
friends and then go down to the football game, walk

06:12.375 --> 06:24.471
down right to Kyle Field, park out in Simpson Drill 
Field, go over to the Hawks, then go on into the

06:12.375 --> 06:24.471
game. And everybody there remembering old times 
and enjoying themselves, catching up on times.

06:33.223 --> 06:36.327
When I came back, I wanted to get as close to the 
campers as I could. If I could move right there, I'd

06:36.779 --> 06:41.865
move there.

06:42.746 --> 06:45.209
Then on the weekends, what would you all do? On the 
weekends during the summer, there was no football

06:46.290 --> 06:50.015
games. Saturday classes, same thing. I did not go 
to church. I never darkened the door of a church.

06:59.246 --> 07:01.769
We'd go to the dances, I guess. But Saturday night 
in the summer, there weren't any dances, were

07:02.049 --> 07:04.392
there? There weren't any dances, no. I mean... 
Just entertain ourselves. Did you go to Guyon?

07:10.242 --> 07:11.404
Were there movies? We'd go to the campus theater. 
We'd go into, catch a ride into Bryan, go to movies

07:13.587 --> 07:19.656
at Bryan if we could, get off. Some of these, you 
know, I have to go back and thought about these

07:21.379 --> 07:26.586
particular questions. But I do remember walking 
the streets of Guyon in khaki uniforms. How did the

07:33.327 --> 07:39.355
people of the community react to people, to young 
men wearing khaki uniforms? Fine, no problem.

07:41.297 --> 07:42.378
They were used to Aggies here. I was thinking the 
other day, coming in here, just think that act of

07:42.398 --> 08:01.242
legislature that established the Agricultural 
Mechanical College of Texas here, and what has

07:42.398 --> 08:01.242
developed that one little act, and you look at this 
big, almost metropolis now, and had they not done

07:42.398 --> 08:01.242
that, Bryan would have been probably smaller than 
that or so. Do you remember, have any idea what the

08:01.677 --> 08:06.221
cost was that first year? Well, I'll tell you. 
Yeah, my brother had a bank account who had lost

08:08.663 --> 08:12.647
$900. And he said he had left instruction that was 
to be used for my education. So my mother and father

08:20.133 --> 08:22.916
transferred it over to my account. And I paid my 
entire first year out of that $900. It seems to me

08:28.221 --> 08:29.862
that... room was $7 a semester, and board was 
relatively the same. And how much spending money

08:38.267 --> 08:40.049
did you have? Well, I was working and I had a 
checking account on that, so I had sufficient, but

08:41.210 --> 08:48.096
I didn't spend much. I still had money left over at 
the end of the semester, you know, at the end of the

08:49.317 --> 08:54.763
year. All right, back to, I think I heard a touching 
item, so that Much of your education was paid for by

08:59.980 --> 09:06.768
your brother's account, and he'd already died in 
action. Yeah. He was missing in action legally at

09:08.590 --> 09:10.733
that time. July 1, 1943.

09:18.902 --> 09:21.465
The war certainly was the topic. Where did you and 
your buddies listen to the radio and get war news?

09:25.430 --> 09:26.511
In our room. What were some of the events that you 
remember almost where you were when you heard the

09:27.115 --> 09:34.044
news, D-Day being one? Oh, D-Day being one. Before 
that, I remember invasion of North Africa.

09:43.577 --> 09:48.363
Let me go through my historical data here. D-Day, 
June, and you're about to break out going across

09:48.383 --> 09:55.553
France. Then,

09:57.001 --> 10:09.377
next big thing, Battle of the Bulge. It wasn't a big 
thing of mine, but we were aware of it. And I was home

10:13.342 --> 10:19.891
on Christmas vacation when that occurred, just 
before I went to the Marines. I was just getting

10:20.351 --> 10:21.573
ready to go to the Marines. I didn't know it when I 
came back from Christmas vacation. And remember,

10:26.752 --> 10:31.038
the semesters transpired over. We had your 
Christmas, New Year's break, about three weeks of

10:31.338 --> 10:35.363
school after that. And then it's hard to get back 
when my parents got worried I was going to report to

10:36.144 --> 10:41.892
the Senate. Right, so you take a full load that 
summer. Right. How cool were those dormitories?

10:50.763 --> 10:54.268
Oh, that's another thing we got in that 
engineering. Because we moved from Walton Hall to

10:56.317 --> 10:59.160
Hart Hall. I was up on the top stoop floor of Hart 
Hall, corner there. There was three of us in a room

11:03.845 --> 11:06.107
there, big room. And taking engineering drawing, 
graded on neateness in August in Texas. And I'd be

11:16.918 --> 11:21.002
doing engineering drawing, sweat just pouring 
off of us. I'd take handkerchiefs. spread the

11:23.283 --> 11:30.290
handkerchiefs all over the drawing board and just 
leave a little space where I was actually making a

11:23.283 --> 11:30.290
mark. Try to keep it, but I almost invariably have 
failed. And I decided, hey, for me, I don't like

11:35.396 --> 11:40.861
this kind of stuff. I'd much rather write 
something. The junior buddies have slide rules?

11:46.267 --> 11:46.587
Oh, yes. We all had slide rules. We wore them 
like... Scabbers by our side. Oh, another thing

11:51.046 --> 12:00.677
was here was ASTP, Army Specialized Training 
Program, and they marched from class to class,

11:51.046 --> 12:00.677
about 14 of them in a group, and they all had their 
slide rules and all those things. Now, were they,

12:00.857 --> 12:04.140
the ASTP, were they treated like Aggies? No, no. 
The ASTP were a separate breed and

12:06.383 --> 12:14.431
weren't considered by us to be Aggies. Where were 
they housed? Some were in the dorms. I don't even, I

12:18.345 --> 12:20.368
guess, in the new area. Okay. No, I'm not for sure. 
They were just around somewhere. Did you go home

12:25.776 --> 12:27.238
much that summer? No. No, I didn't. So you were here 
all summer. Here all, pretty much. Any dates? No.

12:36.511 --> 12:38.534
Were there any social events? I don't remember 
any. I don't remember any of that summer. Football

12:41.855 --> 12:43.197
season, yes. But that summer there were no dances, 
no entertainers. That summer was pretty

12:48.243 --> 12:55.273
something to be, pretty much, I mean, in fact, I did 
not enjoy that summer. When they told me to go back,

12:55.533 --> 12:59.338
the Marines said, oh, okay. And I came back, but I 
enjoyed the fall and couldn't wait to get back from

12:59.943 --> 13:04.269
it. All right, so you come back for the fall 
semester knowing that you're probably going on

13:04.289 --> 13:10.618
active duty at the end of that semester. Yeah, the 
end or before it's over even. My mind was not on my

13:15.225 --> 13:17.929
grades and studies, you can understand. Describe

13:17.969 --> 13:25.680
what it was like then to go to your first football 
games at A&M. Well, let me go back. May I go back? Oh,

13:27.686 --> 13:28.446
of course. It's something that we've gone beyond 
time. Oh, okay. I want to go back to this Hellwood

13:31.849 --> 13:34.992
kid and what happened to him. It was a very bad, 
terrible situation. Oh, and to answer some of your

13:39.597 --> 13:54.471
questions why I can't remember too much about some 
of these things, this kid made a mistake and told

13:39.597 --> 13:54.471
another freshman that he, it was his parents who 
wrote or sent his letter. Mm-hmm. to the

13:55.141 --> 13:56.002
administration. This other freshman kid was 
psychotic, neurotic, or something. And he did

14:02.692 --> 14:14.690
things that were absolutely filthy,

14:02.692 --> 14:14.690
unexcusable, and everything else. And so Fishel 
would drop out of A&M. Well, he took human

14:17.174 --> 14:22.161
excrement, spread it over his underclothes, and 
things like that. Unpardonable. I remember

14:23.246 --> 14:25.088
defending. Other people did that? He did it. This 
one freshman did it. Oh. To Hellwood. Oh, to

14:29.772 --> 14:31.234
Hellwood. Okay. One freshman to another. Yeah. 
And... And Fish Hellwood dropped out of school and

14:34.377 --> 14:41.564
said why he was doing it, though he did not know who 
had done that. And so the administration, in their

14:44.226 --> 14:50.072
wisdom, and they were not very wise, practiced 
mass punishment. And they said for the rest of that

14:51.098 --> 14:57.044
semester that any battery fuel artillery would be 
canvassed. We couldn't go anywhere, do anything.

15:01.328 --> 15:06.674
And kept it up and kept yelling out. They wanted to 
find out who had done that to Fish Hellwood. And it

15:11.459 --> 15:14.321
didn't come forth. Finally, they said that if we, 
if Fish Hellwood, the one who had persecuted Fish

15:14.342 --> 15:20.768
Hellwood, didn't come forth, they were going to 
kick Mr. Bilbeck out of the Corps of Cadets. Well,

15:28.269 --> 15:30.731
Fish, the guy who had done it, was really psycho. He 
would take a lady's hat needle and drive it through

15:30.752 --> 15:34.115
the keg of his leg. I've seen him do it.

15:38.140 --> 15:41.223
He came forth at that, because we loved Mr. 
Bilbeck. And though he once came confessed, and

15:43.406 --> 15:50.113
all of a sudden we were told that we were to report 
buildings, which are some housing over there,

15:51.933 --> 16:03.067
some wooden housing kind of things, over near 
where the engineering section is in that area,

15:51.933 --> 16:03.067
where the engineering buildings are. We just told 
them to fall out at night, about 8 o'clock at night.

16:07.472 --> 16:12.379
We thought they were going to march us to the 
railroad station and ship us all home.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.442
I never heard such good marching. We were all 
hitting together. We thought we were really going

16:19.087 --> 16:20.809
to get it. And we got over there, and Captain Jack 
Kimbrough, the brother of John Kimbrough, was a

16:21.262 --> 16:26.507
attack officer, and he talked. And he came over and 
says, and he totally misread the whole

16:27.328 --> 16:34.094
psychology. He said, now don't hold it against 
this boy for all he's done against, calling you to

16:35.376 --> 16:39.960
get camp was awesome. The administration had made 
a hero of this psychotic kid. It had worked an

16:44.965 --> 16:47.067
absolutely reverse.

16:53.307 --> 17:09.246
he had enforced the Aggie traditions, Aggie way of 
life in a one way, but we didn't know, please

16:53.307 --> 17:09.246
understand, we're not condoning what he did, but 
what they had done was they didn't, they didn't

16:53.307 --> 17:09.246
deal with it correctly. Absolutely, you know, the 
Army taught me that don't use mass punishment, it

17:09.646 --> 17:20.018
just makes an enemy out of the ones that you, make a 
hero out of those that you think you're making an

17:09.646 --> 17:20.018
enemy out of. And so, So they didn't even kick him 
out of school. He flunked out of school. He was that

17:26.259 --> 17:28.922
stupid, in a way. It seemed like in that time that 
the admissions policy at A&M occurred during the

17:29.743 --> 17:38.555
first year of school, maybe the first semester, 
when they flunked out. About 50% of them dropped

17:38.715 --> 17:44.603
out of school after one year, not the first 
semester. The freshman year was pretty tough, and

17:44.864 --> 17:48.609
it was kind of a separate. They didn't have what you 
called... limited selective enrollment, but had

17:52.066 --> 17:56.290
selective keeping, in a sense. Now, all of this 
occurred that first summer? That first summer.

17:59.914 --> 18:03.818
And so we were campers. And A Battery Field 
Artillery has the highest attendance at our many

18:04.418 --> 18:11.846
reunions, our reunions. We have the greatest 
esprit because we were persecuted together. We

18:15.950 --> 18:17.071
were persecuted. We were campers together. And we 
had nothing to do but hang with each other. So when

18:21.277 --> 18:22.738
you ask me, what did we do? Well, we didn't do very 
much because we couldn't. I forgot that. Did y'all

18:25.761 --> 18:27.743
have a nickname, your outfit? No. Really? No. All 
right. So what was special about y'all was this

18:31.026 --> 18:34.509
pulling together. They were very much pulled 
together, yeah. And by and large, where were your

18:36.450 --> 18:39.213
outfit buddies from? Were they small town Texas? 
Small town and country? Lockhart. Well, some

18:43.477 --> 18:44.458
were. But we had a lot from Lamar High School. 
Houston? Houston, River Oaks area. Mm-hmm. One

18:49.846 --> 19:16.967
thing they did do the second semester,

18:49.846 --> 19:16.967
this is one of the strengths of A&M at that time, I 
was in two of my buddies, same level academically,

18:49.846 --> 19:16.967
good but not great, not brilliant brains, but good 
students, on CPA now in Houston, invited me to have

18:49.846 --> 19:16.967
lunch with their family sometimes. And I said, 
great. And so one time I went out to one of these

19:18.993 --> 19:24.180
parents with country school teachers outside 
Lockhart, Texas. Lived in a frame house, very

19:24.440 --> 19:26.323
clean, very nice. Don't be doing that. But it was 
very, what you call, extremely modest home. Then I

19:31.289 --> 19:41.822
went down on a train to Houston with Rocco Benowitz 
and got off the train and got picked up by a

19:31.289 --> 19:41.822
chauffeur driver on the other side. Driven out to 
River Oaks. He laughs at this. I tell this story.

19:45.767 --> 19:46.448
And it seemed like we

19:49.921 --> 19:57.770
father was the executive vice president for 
Weingarten, grocery chain. But the thing is, I was

19:57.790 --> 20:03.177
totally shocked, because these were just two 
buddies. They wore uniform, neither of them could

20:03.197 --> 20:11.427
wear a cashmere coat or be in a Jewish fraternity or 
anything like that. They were equals. Now as a

20:12.908 --> 20:14.190
historian I say, If you want absolute equality, 
you've got to impose those kind of rules. If you

20:19.405 --> 20:25.952
want egalitarianism, you're going to have to have 
certain rules and regulations, and you lose

20:19.405 --> 20:25.952
individual freedoms and so forth. But it was nice 
in that aspect for a period of time, but I wouldn't

20:25.972 --> 20:30.738
want to live with it permanently. During that 
first summer, did you write many letters, get many

20:31.539 --> 20:36.105
phone calls? No, no. I was pretty 
self-sufficient. I

20:40.029 --> 20:44.835
had two older brothers. My mother did not pay a 
whole lot of attention to me. She didn't need to.

20:49.938 --> 20:52.282
And you didn't have a steady girlfriend at that 
point? I didn't have a steady girlfriend, which is

20:52.302 --> 20:55.286
another story we'll come to later on. So you go home 
at the end of summer, and what did you tell your

20:55.306 --> 21:01.776
family and your folks that A&M was like? I didn't. 
You didn't? I assumed they knew. Okay. You know,

21:05.382 --> 21:07.064
their sons had been here. My grandfather and his 
son and his son were the first three generations of

21:08.286 --> 21:13.995
A&M, and we We knew what A&M was like. I did not, I 
knew what I was getting into when I came in. I wanted

21:18.552 --> 21:19.013
to. Most of my classmates didn't, but I did. Now, 
were most of your classmates, as far as you can

21:23.878 --> 21:29.865
recall, first-generation college students?

21:33.729 --> 21:35.070
Did you call me first-generation? My mother went, 
but my father didn't.

21:40.385 --> 21:44.672
All right, and you're only home a brief time 
between summer and fall semester. Went home

21:45.233 --> 21:46.455
Thanksgiving, I think. All right, then you come 
back, and now there's a larger enrollment because

21:46.816 --> 21:52.865
of the fall semester? Oh, yeah, when I came back, I 
came back, I went in the Marines in January 22,

21:52.946 --> 21:59.997
1945, was discharged. But wait, wait, let's do 
this fall semester before you leave. You come

22:02.951 --> 22:10.421
back, and were there many first semester fish that 
fall? Not many some, but not many. So most of them,

22:11.923 --> 22:14.786
most of the fish had come in the summer. Because 
they wanted to squeeze as much college as they

22:14.806 --> 22:28.043
could, because we all knew that unless we had some 
physical, or were very, very young, even the very

22:14.806 --> 22:28.043
young assumed that they were going to go into 
the... Now, when did you become 18th? I became AT

22:28.883 --> 22:32.708
the first of October of 1944. All right, that fall 
semester. Right. All right, and you're still an

22:35.853 --> 22:38.556
engineering major at this point? No. You changed. 
I changed. To history. Changed to history.

22:42.522 --> 22:44.144
Liberal arts, colon, history. Who did you go, do 
you remember who you went to talk to about that?

22:47.789 --> 22:48.290
Nobody. Nobody. Who did you turn to those first two 
semesters for any kind of advice? Nobody. So you

22:55.765 --> 22:57.047
determined... They had a course you were supposed 
to take with a catalog. You just signed up for those

23:00.773 --> 23:01.995
courses. Right, and in the fall, you had fewer 
labs, so what did you do with your extra time?

23:13.092 --> 23:14.154
Played more sports. Played more movies. And that 
fall, you must have had some of the routine, Aggie

23:16.016 --> 23:23.528
routine of football games, describe going to an 
Aggie football game as a fish? One thing we did do, I

23:28.860 --> 23:37.453
had a good friend, I knew him, I had known him, 
Marshall. I would have labeled him my best friend,

23:37.513 --> 23:51.473
who I knew was a great junior high school football 
player, turned out to be a great high school

23:37.513 --> 23:51.473
football player, turned out to be a great college 
football player, and a great professional

23:37.513 --> 23:51.473
football player, named Hawaii Tittle. we were 
going to go over and play LSU, and Y.E. Tittle had

23:56.525 --> 24:04.835
gone from Marshall to Texas, where the number one 
guy was going to be a guy named Bobby Lane, and Y.E.

24:04.895 --> 24:11.664
Tittle saw he was going to be second fiddle to Bobby 
Lane, so he left Texas and went to LSU. Yelberton

24:12.225 --> 24:14.908
Abraham Tittle. And so I wanted to go over and see 
him, and we got instructions from the

24:23.161 --> 24:27.208
administration that we were not to cut Saturday 
morning classes. If we did we would be considered

24:27.989 --> 24:50.265
absent without leave and we would be severely 
disciplined and about 700 of us said to heck with

24:27.989 --> 24:50.265
you and we got out and hitchhiked about 55th and 
Line at the East Gate and got a ride in Finally came

24:50.482 --> 24:55.349
in a car that caught on fire as we drove into 
Navasota. So I got out there and that was the worst

24:56.491 --> 25:02.620
thing that could happen to you because every car 
going out of Navasota was filled with Aggies. So

25:03.401 --> 25:10.532
another friend and I had to hire a taxi to take us to 
Hempstead to get on that other highway from Austin

25:03.401 --> 25:10.532
to Houston. So we hired a taxi and got to Hempstead 
and went over. So we hitchhiked over and met this

25:12.996 --> 25:19.105
other friend of mine, Rocker Benowitz, and we 
hitchhiked over. got picked up by a Jewish couple

25:19.692 --> 25:24.178
in a big Buick, the biggest Buick they made at the 
time. And I told Brock this, and I said, you know,

25:25.060 --> 25:32.230
they found his name was Rabinowitz, and they 
couldn't do enough for us. Bought us lunch and

25:33.131 --> 25:35.274
everything, went over there. You went all the way 
to Baton Rouge? To Baton Rouge. And I came back, and

25:39.240 --> 25:47.151
I got 20 demerits, which put me on academic conduct 
probation, and wrote a letter to my parents. My

25:47.191 --> 25:48.433
mother wrote back and said, My Robert, and she had 
lost one son, I remember. Robert had my permission

25:53.329 --> 25:54.791
to go. If you want to send him home, please do. She 
had lost one son, and she was just as happy to have me

25:59.918 --> 26:03.203
home. And what was the reaction here? I didn't hear 
it. But I saw a copy of the letter. But you didn't get

26:10.433 --> 26:11.334
any. She came back very hot at them. But it didn't 
get you any extra trouble here? No, no. Send him

26:17.152 --> 26:19.155
home if you want to send him home. In fact, about how 
long did the trip from College Station to Baton

26:19.175 --> 26:23.902
Rouge take? Well, we left about noon on Friday.

26:32.073 --> 26:33.576
We did pretty good. Saturday morning, I think, we 
got into Baton Rouge. I know there was nighttime

26:38.463 --> 26:42.248
when we were riding in the back of a truck. open 
bedded truck from Houston into Beaumont, and it

26:43.021 --> 26:47.748
was cold. And then we got picked up at Beaumont by 
the Stewart couple, and I guess it was early

26:49.150 --> 26:55.740
morning, and they drove us on in. It's hard to get 
those foggy. But coming back was an interesting

26:58.585 --> 27:04.594
experience, too, because I was planning on taking 
the train back, because I wanted to be sure. I

27:04.614 --> 27:05.275
didn't want to hitchhike. I spent the night at the 
athletic dorm at LSU.

27:20.939 --> 27:28.907
I was in big trouble because it was noontime and it 
was Sunday. And I had to, the game was a night game.

27:32.411 --> 27:36.456
And so while he took me out to the highway, I started 
filming. A guy came by and said, I only have a half a

27:36.476 --> 27:42.182
tank of gas. I'm going to Houston, but I don't have 
any gas tanks. If you want to take a chance with me,

27:45.525 --> 27:47.267
okay. So I did, and that was before Interstate came 
around. And he was talking to these little film

27:51.491 --> 28:00.020
stations where you'd park the film station, 
grocery store kind of thing, going and

27:51.491 --> 28:00.020
sweet-talking these Cajun girls. And they'd fill 
up his tank of gas and give him some stamps. He ended

28:02.943 --> 28:08.429
up in Houston with a full tank of gas and a full book 
of stamps. I'm not lying. I mean, as a historian,

28:09.710 --> 28:12.493
this is the truth. But he would sweet-talk these. 
do all kinds of things. And so I got to Houston

28:18.947 --> 28:22.894
before the train did. They took a train from 
Houston on it. Did people recognize Aggie

28:24.658 --> 28:28.946
uniforms in Louisiana? Oh, yes. It was a way of 
life. The blue lapels.

28:34.818 --> 28:35.960
You got rides easily. Really easily. In all of your 
hitchhiking, did you ever have any negative

28:37.012 --> 28:40.715
experience? No, never. I have not yet gotten one. 
Never, never, never. No homosexual advances.

28:48.482 --> 28:56.168
I've heard a few of them where the driver was drunk, 
going too fast, or maybe he'd been drinking a

28:48.482 --> 28:56.168
little too much, but nothing worse than that. 
Nothing worse than that, drunk. Let's see, and how

28:57.529 --> 28:59.791
did the Aggies come out in that game? We lost the 
game 7-0, though there were only 700 or so that were

29:01.553 --> 29:06.096
stopped again. They made a mistake. People didn't 
know, Aggie stand of the game. And they put us down,

29:10.584 --> 29:14.773
the terrible seats down at the ground level. You 
understand what happened then? Freshmen at the

29:18.280 --> 29:22.630
lowest level, then sophomores, juniors, and 
seniors standing up. So everybody all the way back

29:23.131 --> 29:26.718
up there had to stand up too. Said, ow, balance run! 
We stopped the game without yelling. First time

29:30.191 --> 29:32.653
that I've ever seen it, you know. Just the 700 of us 
yelled so loud that why couldn't we call some of

29:32.673 --> 29:36.818
them? And if anybody today saw the yell leaders in 
action then, would it have been quite similar to

29:37.138 --> 29:47.670
today? Yes. There were four then, not five. Two 
seniors, two juniors. But the yells were similar?

29:53.296 --> 29:57.441
Yells were similar, except we had some that they 
dropped.

29:58.923 --> 30:03.189
When I was back, they used to have Lizzie when we won 
the ball game. Have you heard of it? Is my hat on

30:06.915 --> 30:08.237
straight? Let me hear a powder puff, sweet cherry 
frosty. Son of a gun, Lizzie. And ladies. We see

30:16.930 --> 30:18.292
you, ladies. We love you, ladies. So they had 
those, and they were similar. Then also they would

30:23.239 --> 30:27.445
yell, because they had limited substitution, One 
of my friends, Country Higgins, had come off the

30:28.133 --> 30:31.256
field. 15 for Higgins. Every time a substitute 
came off the field, he got an individual cheer for

30:33.158 --> 30:39.325
himself. Now, during those wartime years, the A&M 
team was quite young, wasn't it? Yes,

30:46.332 --> 30:49.055
particularly in 1943, the year before we came. 
That was the Kitty Corps. Kitty Corps, yeah. They

30:52.178 --> 30:53.159
did very well. Our freshman year, we did not do so 
well. But they did reasonably well, but it wasn't

30:57.665 --> 31:02.009
like the petticoat year. Right. When there was a 
home game, describe the routine for you fish that

31:03.391 --> 31:10.217
fall on a Saturday for game day. You got up, went to 
class. Got up, went to class. And

31:14.081 --> 31:25.933
I'm

31:14.081 --> 31:25.933
trying to separate what's really fresh of my last 
three years from my first year. We did not march in.

31:32.364 --> 31:33.546
It's to the best of my memory. Was there a Yale 
practice the night before? At that time, it was on

31:35.969 --> 31:42.959
the steps of the YMCA building. And it was not at 
midnight? It was not at midnight. We had a guy, the

31:47.205 --> 31:49.268
lady was a Rhodes Scholar. He left here and went to 
West Point after...
