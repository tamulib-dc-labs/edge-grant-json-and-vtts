00:03.524 --> 00:10.293
In your efforts to build the department, did you or 
any of your colleagues go to any meetings to

00:03.524 --> 00:10.293
recruit students? Let me see. Let me tell you how I 
handled it. You know, at one time, A&M says, you're

00:18.365 --> 00:23.953
going to teach this class at 8 o'clock and 10 
o'clock and so forth. And they told me, what are you

00:24.794 --> 00:28.138
going to teach and when are you going to teach? 
Well, I knew that was wrong philosophy. So I said, I

00:30.942 --> 00:32.805
want you to give me your Three requests of what you 
want to teach and what time you want to teach it, and

00:34.034 --> 00:42.803
I'll work it out for you. I've got me a great big week 
map and filled in all of these. And it developed.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.273
There were people who liked 8 o'clock, people who 
liked 10 o'clock. You didn't have to say, you're

00:52.693 --> 00:54.295
going to do this. When they gave me that back, I 
could fill in the blanks. And I got there,

00:58.891 --> 01:01.681
everybody told me what they wanted. Got what they 
wanted at the time, and no hassle. And I'm having

01:06.218 --> 01:07.483
trouble in life. If you treat people that way, you 
don't But I wasn't about to sit there and say, look,

01:13.370 --> 01:17.755
you're going to teach them this this time, this 
this time. Well, a lot of people don't like 8

01:18.315 --> 01:20.477
o'clock. They like 10 o'clock. And a lot of people 
who don't like 10 o'clock will take 8 o'clock. It

01:25.182 --> 01:25.863
works out. You just have to treat people the way you 
would like to be treated and be fair to everybody.

01:32.950 --> 01:34.372
And that was the philosophy I used. And I remember 
when we went over a 50% girl, so they really went

01:34.893 --> 01:42.060
into action. How many years did that take? Do you 
remember? Seven. Seven. So from 68 to... From 70.

01:49.079 --> 01:49.199
No. I didn't have anything to do with the teaching. 
They only let me have a key until 69. 69. I got a key.

02:02.371 --> 02:05.194
In January of 70, they gave me all of it. Okay. And I 
had to rebuild from that 70. 70.

02:13.006 --> 02:13.927
That's right, 70. And in seven years, we had the 540 
kids, a new building, and the $2 million endowed

02:14.528 --> 02:24.904
chair from Ben's family. And that's about as fast 
as you can build. But anyway, I enjoyed that. As I

02:31.573 --> 02:38.944
said, the greatest experience of my life was 
rebuilding Horticulture to a viable building, a

02:31.573 --> 02:38.944
viable department. And I had to write the history 
of the department because I had known or what it was

02:43.415 --> 02:45.699
as students. And I knew we had good professors back 
there. Mr. Bryson was a top professor. Dr. Adrian

02:50.647 --> 02:53.031
was a top professor. And I had both of them. You take 
the good and leave the rest as you go along. And of

03:00.063 --> 03:07.576
course, with what they had and your philosophy all 
mixed together, you come up with a viable mix. And

03:07.596 --> 03:09.439
that was what we did in horticulture. When you 
first became responsible for the department,

03:09.942 --> 03:22.458
describe the facilities and the office space that 
the department had when you started. OK, we had a

03:23.439 --> 03:28.245
small office for myself and a small office next 
door. And we had

03:30.027 --> 03:34.753
two other offices. And we had some offices that 
were occupied

03:41.279 --> 04:02.578
forestry and where were those they were they had 
they were in in rooms that we needed but what

03:41.279 --> 04:02.578
building uh old horticulture building uh plant 
science building no plant science building

03:41.279 --> 04:02.578
because for me we just had a meager space we had one 
hall one off and down the hall for um floriculture

03:41.279 --> 04:02.578
and then we had the two There's three offices in the 
rest of the suite. But Forestry had some sites that

04:05.986 --> 04:13.519
they had a day and just assumed those rooms. And 
they were really in our room, but we couldn't get

04:14.140 --> 04:17.426
them back. Luckily, I was on the Master Plan 
Committee, and Perry Atkinson was on that. And he

04:24.361 --> 04:26.323
supported me. What we needed was a horticulture 
building, something where we could grow. But we

04:31.928 --> 04:33.349
had no space to grow whatever. And he supported me. 
And together, he got an extra $5 million grant

04:35.891 --> 04:45.860
through Dr. Kunkel to build a horticulture. When 
Perry Atkinson told Kunkel that we desperately

04:48.042 --> 04:53.727
needed space, that opened the door. And we did get 
the building. But I knew we had $13 million for the

04:57.279 --> 05:01.545
building. And our parents told us, that's not 
enough. So he was on the big committee. And

05:10.458 --> 05:12.881
together, we got an extra $5 million. And we got 
that $18 million. And I never will forget that one

05:15.885 --> 05:21.213
of the people, well, I'll tell you. Let me think of 
his name. He just died recently. He was the rose man

05:26.233 --> 05:30.818
from Tyler. And DeWorth brought him down and then 
wanted to fire him. And

05:35.724 --> 05:41.310
Bloodworth wouldn't let him fire him. So I 
inherited him. And he said it was like a breath of

05:43.553 --> 05:46.577
fresh air coming in. Because I wouldn't take 
anything off of DeWorth. See, DeWorth had

05:50.272 --> 05:55.658
destroyed landscape architecture completely in 
the years. Well, Mr. Hensel had hired Bob White,

05:58.021 --> 06:05.489
and he was building landscape architecture. But 
after Mr. Hensel died, DeWorth would give Bob

06:06.169 --> 06:14.198
White no help, no support, whatever. And finally, 
he moved to Houston and opened a practice.

06:19.938 --> 06:24.923
Then DeWorth, well, I came along. And I wouldn't 
take a leap off of DeWorth, because I knew not to.

06:31.028 --> 06:34.291
But we finally got Bob White back. But you see, Bob 
White then went from the College of Agriculture to

06:35.112 --> 06:42.419
the College of Engineering, where landscape 
architecture belonged. And then it became, thus,

06:43.039 --> 06:49.185
the College of Environmental

06:43.039 --> 06:49.185
Design. And he was there and went to Harvard there. 
And Robert White has done a masterful job. I call

06:55.852 --> 06:58.316
him the Renaissance man in landscape 
architecture. And he was really a good man, but

06:59.217 --> 07:05.007
DeWorth just sacrificed him for what he did. But 
anyway, DeWorth could get along with nobody and

07:06.129 --> 07:10.516
didn't even try to because he had tenure. But they 
finally retired him. All right, so you served for

07:15.271 --> 07:19.597
how many years as department head? No, I didn't 
serve department head. I've served... I mean, as

07:24.665 --> 07:36.442
the head of that part of the...

07:24.665 --> 07:36.442
From 70 till... 70 to 71. Wait a minute. 70 to 71. 
Seven years. Seven years. We rebuilt that thing

07:42.390 --> 07:44.333
completely. And all we did in the world was open the 
door, tell the students you're welcome. I said,

07:49.740 --> 07:51.643
don't ever see me with the door locked. I wouldn't 
let them lock the door. She would knock on the door

07:52.764 --> 07:57.391
to get in. I said, never again. And my thinking, and 
I told them, I said, when you don't have any

07:58.853 --> 08:04.101
students to teach, you don't have a job here. And 
just get that through your head right now. And

08:07.046 --> 08:08.167
we've got work to do. I felt like you had to be firm, 
fair, and consistent all the way through this. And

08:14.080 --> 08:15.482
that's what I tried to do all the time. But I was so 
delighted that at the end of seven years, we had a

08:17.304 --> 08:21.769
viable department. And then they said, well, we 
have to have a PhD to hit it. And that's when they got

08:25.793 --> 08:27.195
Mr. Grolick. Now, who were the key people that 
supported that growth, that helped you with it

08:28.557 --> 08:38.488
outside the department? You mentioned... Oh, 
Bloodworth. Okay. And Dick Potts. Dick Potts was

08:44.270 --> 08:45.792
our friend. He was the associate, as associate 
dean. Associate dean. Wonderful person. Just, I

08:50.337 --> 08:57.806
don't think I could have ever done harder culture 
without his help. I'd go down and he'd support me

08:57.827 --> 09:07.238
on, see, I had to have, I had all the advising and 
counseling for every member of the department.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.222
Nobody ever told those kids what to take or when to 
take them or anything else. There was some kids

09:10.782 --> 09:13.045
that stayed in school a year or two long They lost a 
lot of money that way, kids. But I'd make up a course

09:17.077 --> 09:21.863
of study, and I'd tell them how to do it and when to do 
it. And they had to do this. The students can't read

09:23.705 --> 09:26.087
the catalog and know how to do this. If you don't 
give them some help, they're lost. So I would guide

09:30.212 --> 09:31.934
them as best I could. I had all of them myself. 
Nobody else did it. But Dick Potts would help me.

09:38.662 --> 09:43.588
When I got in a real bind with a kid to get him out of 
school, I'd do this. I'll give you an example of one

09:44.159 --> 09:45.881
student. It wasn't an A&M, it was a Texas Tech choir 
taught three years. We had a young man who was 90%

09:49.726 --> 10:00.358
disabled from mental, shell-shocked, and nobody 
worked with him. So I thought, well, I'm going to

10:02.320 --> 10:06.405
take him on and make a human out of him. So I knew it 
was just like a timber box. The least thing could

10:09.248 --> 10:10.670
set him off. So he needed help. three or four green 
points to graduate. And he had taken a course over.

10:21.004 --> 10:28.150
So finally I said, now Earl, I want you to take a 
course over and I'll watch it for you. But before I

10:28.210 --> 10:31.914
could tell him what to take, he enrolled in 
chemistry. And he failed chemistry again. Now we

10:35.417 --> 10:36.698
were back to square one. Well, he was really upset 
because he failed chemistry. And I said, now Earl,

10:42.530 --> 10:44.652
You stay with me, and I'm going to guide you 
through. We're going to get you out of this

10:44.692 --> 10:46.253
university. And I knew I could get him out of the 
university if I handled him right. But you can't

10:50.977 --> 10:54.440
just desert a guy like that and never get anywhere 
with him. So I worked with him real fine, and I had

10:55.301 --> 11:01.046
him almost over the barrier. And Hilo Urbanski, 
the head of the org, came in, and he wanted a piece of

11:01.867 --> 11:06.071
paper. And he opened a drawer, and there was Earl's 
30th and 40th piece of cardboard he was working on.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.995
And he said, oh, you're just, hell, I'll just take 
that paper. You're wasting your time anyway with

11:16.015 --> 11:17.416
that man. And at that minute, he walked in and heard 
all this. He was drunk for three days. I finally got

11:25.284 --> 11:26.345
him in the corner. I said, Earl, don't you ever go 
around urbanizing again. I'm going to work you or

11:32.311 --> 11:35.814
get you out of university here. We got him out. It 
was 03 or 04 grade points to spare. And you know that

11:40.613 --> 11:49.890
he went off to somewhere else and got a Ph.D. in 
guidance and counseling?

11:49.910 --> 11:55.420
And that's what brought up, I can think, what would 
have happened to that kid if I left him alone? Now,

11:55.440 --> 11:59.948
the dean at this time was Harry Kunkel. No, this was 
at Texas Tech. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right.

12:08.045 --> 12:12.151
Kunkel was the dean when you were building this 
department. And he was supportive of the growth

12:12.792 --> 12:15.116
and development. No, he said, what are you going to 
do with all these girls? He said, they can't all be

12:18.120 --> 12:20.684
biochemists. And I said, no, they don't want to be 
biochemists. There's a whole other world out

12:22.306 --> 12:25.551
there, Dean, besides biochemistry. And we're 
going to explore it for you. I said, don't you

12:27.880 --> 12:32.184
realize that the better we look and harder it goes, 
the better it makes you look better? And he said,

12:33.285 --> 12:34.326
no, no. He didn't accept that. Yeah, I had some 
rough things to overcome with them because they

12:36.708 --> 12:49.138
had that old Aggie autocratic

12:36.708 --> 12:49.138
way. And he says, they can't all take a pile. And I 
said, they don't want to do it. All right, and you

12:58.492 --> 13:01.215
mentioned Perry Edkisson. He, at that point, was 
department? No, he was assistant dean. Oh, he was

13:06.000 --> 13:07.342
assistant dean. Describe him. He was on the math, 
he was on the, Perry Edkisson was at a high rank on

13:10.966 --> 13:19.055
campus. He was head of entomology, I know, and I 
brought a student there one time that discovered

13:22.454 --> 13:35.910
in his research, he discovered a new

13:22.454 --> 13:35.910
strain of something that had never been done 
before, original research. And he said, just send

13:36.691 --> 13:39.034
me all the kids like that you can send me. And from 
that day on, we were great friends. And we ended up

13:42.178 --> 13:45.301
both on the campus planting. And that's where we 
got the money for the horticulture building.

13:51.631 --> 13:56.756
He, Perry Atkinson, is a scholar from way back. 
Back to Mr. Rutter a second. As you worked with him

13:59.279 --> 14:07.987
and Mr. Cherry and the others, were you aware of any 
decline in Mr. Rutter's health? That was right in

14:09.028 --> 14:10.490
my life. You know, all of a sudden somebody said, 
Mr. Rutter is sick. Next thing I knew, he was dead.

14:20.259 --> 14:20.980
And... LBJ came down, a whole few came down, and I 
just took over arranging the flowers. You never

14:31.386 --> 14:33.368
saw so many flowers in your barn in days. And they 
called me from Florida and said, we got one from the

14:33.949 --> 14:37.973
Secretary of State. We got one from this place in 
Milwaukee. Get us a police farm. And I saved them a

14:41.277 --> 14:42.498
police farm. We stacked them in there that way and 
did the best we could. And LBJ came down, and boy, I

14:48.585 --> 14:51.608
tell you, That was one more big day. I never had any 
inkling that he was ill. And he died one month

14:53.595 --> 15:00.683
before his 60th birthday. I knew that all of a 
sudden the campus got quiet. And it was rumored

15:08.732 --> 15:12.536
that he had a heart attack. And so it was. The 
doctor, I'd say the doctor came, and I believe they

15:16.867 --> 15:21.315
took him away from there, took him away from there 
in an ambulance. The next thing we knew, he'd be

15:21.996 --> 15:23.238
gone. All right. When Dr. Williams came, what was 
your first interaction with him? Great.

15:30.571 --> 15:31.652
Absolutely wonderful. Never had a world 
presence. I said, details. He was huge. I did

15:40.964 --> 15:45.393
things for him before he ever knew me, before his 
wife ever got there. It was just part of the job to

15:45.894 --> 15:49.320
get these things done. And he appreciated it a 
great deal. But for a man to come to me and say, I've

15:53.268 --> 16:01.244
not met you, I'm Jack Williams, and this man is a 
short statue. We need to lower that. And a minute

16:03.391 --> 16:07.817
later, kind of detailed, I never did anything like 
that. He didn't write me anything. He didn't write

16:08.438 --> 16:09.279
me a note. Just note after note after note all the 
time, thanking me for things that were just a

16:09.820 --> 16:15.708
routine part of the job I was supposed to do. And 
after his heart trouble, he never was the same,

16:16.609 --> 16:23.398
though. I just, I think, I thought I lost one of the 
finest friends I'd ever had. I just thought the

16:28.785 --> 16:30.107
world of him. He'd say, can you get so-and-so to 
play golf with us this afternoon? Well, that

16:36.412 --> 16:42.503
worked out fine, except every now and then 
somebody said, I want you to get me and Jake to play

16:36.412 --> 16:42.503
golf with the president. I said, I can't do that. If 
he don't want you to play with him, you're not going

16:44.266 --> 16:46.890
to do it. He said, he'll ask me if you want to do it. 
And Armin Simpson played with him. But

16:52.447 --> 16:59.533
when he, from the time his heart attack on, he was a 
completely different man. And I know you would be,

17:00.474 --> 17:03.517
anybody would be. But I just thought the world and 
all of him. And I'm glad we got a building name for

17:07.821 --> 17:11.865
him. Describe, you worked with Mrs. Williams. 
Describe her and her personality.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.234
Very different than the thing I was used to. She 
wanted to rearrange the way I put the plants around

17:23.108 --> 17:30.017
the stage at commencement and things like this. 
And she was quite satisfied with the plants and the

17:30.838 --> 17:37.006
way we had them arranged and the flowers. They were 
quite satisfied with it. She wanted so she could do

17:39.149 --> 17:41.472
them better, which is all right. I didn't question 
her. She loved to do her thing. We never crossed the

17:44.977 --> 17:45.938
line. That's the way it goes. All right. In As we got 
near the 100th anniversary, 1976, there were

17:52.353 --> 18:03.891
plans to add to the landscaping on the campus. Did 
that fall within your? Yeah, but it fell through. I

18:07.977 --> 18:08.538
didn't buy it. I had some friends in California 
that raised roses, red roses. And I wanted to get a

18:16.811 --> 18:20.757
maroon and white rose, Aggie rose. And that's the 
right flat of his face. What happened? I just

18:25.765 --> 18:29.089
proposed it, and nothing ever came of it. It just 
died. Oh, the campus didn't support it? Nobody

18:33.553 --> 18:34.414
supported it. Oh, really? Oh. I gave this to the 
board at a board meeting. We were talking about

18:41.782 --> 18:45.286
Campus 76 as a theme. And I couldn't get anybody. 
There'll be six campus celebrations. Now, didn't

18:53.526 --> 18:59.694
we plant the trees all the way around the old horse 
pasture and the golf course? Wasn't that?

19:00.575 --> 19:01.676
Perimeter trees was out. But that was not part of 
that. That was planned expansion on my part. Oh,

19:06.062 --> 19:07.884
that was not part of the centennial? No. I just felt 
like we needed perimeter trees to mark the campus.

19:14.092 --> 19:19.819
And whereas they were planted on main campus 20 and 
30 feet apart where they couldn't grow, except we

19:20.508 --> 19:21.850
didn't mention top. And that's what's caused a lot 
of problems up there. We put them 80 feet from the

19:24.673 --> 19:26.976
street and 80 feet apart. I wanted them back far 
enough to make a statement in design, and then we

19:27.857 --> 19:35.166
wouldn't have to cut them down if we widened 
anything. And then they widened, take the avenue,

19:35.186 --> 19:38.811
and luckily we didn't ruin the trees.

19:41.714 --> 19:46.380
If, in addition to the maroon and white rows, Were 
there any other dreams you had for the centennial

19:47.997 --> 19:52.464
that you wish we could have done? Well, we didn't 
get the first base of any plans on that. I don't know

19:58.793 --> 20:02.779
whether the rose scared them off or what. These are 
very good friends of mine and the number one

20:03.520 --> 20:09.710
growers, Tops and Roses in California. And they 
grew the Mr. Lincoln. and Oklahoma that we

20:15.233 --> 20:21.963
introduced at the New York's World Fair, both of 
them. Illinois built the only brick building on

20:23.325 --> 20:30.275
that campus and called it the Land of Lincoln, and 
they had the figure of him. They helped get his

20:30.295 --> 20:31.937
birthday read. And so I went over to the lady, and I 
said, now I have some friends who are hybridizing

20:32.778 --> 20:43.013
the rules whose birthday is the next 12th, which is 
Lincoln's birthday. and I can get you all the roses

20:43.600 --> 20:47.706
you want to play on this place if you'd like to have 
them." She said, we'd love to have them. Well, she

20:49.509 --> 20:51.872
and me won for the long fight. She bought bud faces, 
and she'd go out every morning and cut three roses.

20:56.840 --> 21:04.391
And in two weeks, two years, she delivered a bud 
face of Mr. Lincoln to every director of that camp

20:56.840 --> 21:04.391
of a fair. And then we introduced the rose Mr., I 
mean, Oklahoma there. When the last day of the

21:13.165 --> 21:22.258
fair, people were pulling those things up, roots 
and all, even grabbing a piece of grass to take with

21:13.165 --> 21:22.258
them. But it was quite an experience. I was asked if 
I could do the... Well, first a young man called me

21:25.703 --> 21:33.674
one day and said, we would like to get your help on 
the fair. Well, I thought they meant the state fair

21:34.335 --> 21:36.558
in Oklahoma City. And he said... I said, yeah, I can 
help you. I said, look, are you talking about the

21:40.343 --> 21:44.028
New York World Fair? I said, I can't speak for that 
much time, but if Dr. Cross wants me to help you, he

21:44.448 --> 21:52.158
says we'll help you. And so Dr. Cross called me 
about an hour. He said, I wish everybody on the

21:56.883 --> 22:00.688
staff knew that I was president. But those people 
were so great. And you know, he played football for

22:05.660 --> 22:12.688
South Dakota. And he had a scholarship to wash the 
dishes. He said, well, if I figured if I could wash

22:17.093 --> 22:22.880
dishes in the girls' dormitory, I'd see every girl 
in that school. And sure enough, the prettiest

22:23.661 --> 22:31.890
girl in the whole school came through, and I got 
her.

22:32.461 --> 22:39.432
were beginning to, as the enrollment began to 
expand under Mr. Rutter and Dr. Williams, the

22:32.461 --> 22:39.432
campus had to expand. Did you have a chance to be a 
part of the planning? I was supposed to until Paul

22:44.860 --> 22:52.552
Stevens, everything we proposed, Paul Stevens 
overruled it. And I wish I could remember the name

22:52.572 --> 22:59.042
of the man that had so much trouble with him beside 
me.

23:01.503 --> 23:10.016
I was supposed to be in on everything, but 
Stevenson never approved anything that I thought

23:01.503 --> 23:10.016
of. Looking back, if

23:10.737 --> 23:25.300
we could undo what we did and do it correctly, what 
should we have done in planning the master plan at

23:10.737 --> 23:25.300
A&M for the growth? What are some mistakes that... 
Well, we should have had a master plan, not just a

23:27.389 --> 23:32.115
piecemeal. Everything was done building by 
building, and it came on the line, and you tried to

23:32.976 --> 23:39.084
fit them in or not. Now, I knew that the main axis was 
east-west. Wait a minute, is that right? Mm-hmm.

23:46.934 --> 23:48.135
Yeah. And we had to terminate that axis somewhere. 
It went through the middle of the administration

23:51.773 --> 23:54.876
academic building. And so I terminated it before 
we got out to that creek or river. Well, the

24:04.244 --> 24:05.986
drainage ditch is back there. And so we 
terminated, put the horticulture building as a

24:06.886 --> 24:13.612
terminus of that axis. And then beyond that, we 
could go other directions. But we had to terminate

24:18.277 --> 24:19.958
that. axis before it fell off into that creek 
leading to the river. And after we got the main axis

24:25.269 --> 24:32.720
established, then we could have done cross axes on 
it. That kind of planning was the kind that was

24:34.803 --> 24:37.507
being done back then. Now the planning is entirely 
different. But you need quadrangles and those

24:42.174 --> 24:47.903
kind of things. What

24:49.047 --> 24:56.455
kind of plant life should we have encouraged on the 
campus?

24:59.518 --> 25:00.519
You mean other than trees? Well, and trees, both. 
Of course, I told you the story of the palms and the

25:02.901 --> 25:07.326
oaks. I still think the lab oaks were all right for 
the tree of choice. But I think we should have had a

25:14.613 --> 25:19.498
few more in there, different species, if nothing 
else, just to study.

25:22.842 --> 25:35.896
But there

25:22.842 --> 25:35.896
are a lot of real good broadleaf evergreens that we 
use and are still using. This thing right here, you

25:37.097 --> 25:42.262
saw that tree at lunch? Is that that one? That's the 
name of it. And it started blooming in November.

25:49.039 --> 25:50.642
Loro Petalum. L-O-R-O-P-E-T-A-L-U-M. Loro 
Petalum. Petalum. Chinese fringe flower. Now,

25:57.350 --> 25:59.934
that thing has been blooming since November here. 
And it'll grow in Colorado State as well. All

26:03.989 --> 26:06.914
right, should we have tried to grow roses? No. What 
kinds of bushes should A&M? Well, there are a lot of

26:11.661 --> 26:14.526
shrubs that we can grow. One of the best is Pitta's 
Forum, and it's very good in evergreen, all green.

26:20.756 --> 26:22.459
That's one of the best ones we have.

26:26.425 --> 26:28.208
The school colors are easy to come by. At the 
University of Oklahoma, I'd plant red tulips in

26:31.107 --> 26:34.792
front of the boys' dormitories and white tulips in 
front of the girls' dormitories. Just, you know, a

26:35.413 --> 26:36.975
little bit of fun. And we're not in a four-season 
climate. We're in a four-season climate, we've

26:44.145 --> 26:46.428
got a lot of things for. But you've got to, for 
instance, nothing is majestic to me as a

26:47.269 --> 26:58.304
tall-bearded Irish, but you've got to be in the 
four-seasons area to get enough coal to make those

26:47.269 --> 26:58.304
things majestic. I used to grow up in Oklahoma all 
the time, And as a collection. And there was Irish

27:04.035 --> 27:06.938
shoes with them. But how did you come out with your 
raised beds? So far, so good. You know, if you have

27:11.743 --> 27:14.966
raised beds, you can control the water. But if you 
don't have control of your beds, they can let me

27:15.747 --> 27:21.053
drown out. And this is one of the first things I 
learned about Fred and his home at A&M. They had

27:25.777 --> 27:28.640
just that little place that you could grow those 
flowers. And we grew them for it. Any

27:30.912 --> 27:41.046
particular varieties of grass that A&M should 
have attempted?

27:43.710 --> 27:50.539
Well, before we had irrigation, they would 
tolerate anything with Bermuda. And in the shade

27:51.320 --> 27:54.985
places, you couldn't grow anything. So I think a 
combination of Bermuda grass and St. Augustine

27:55.706 --> 28:00.733
will work with irrigation. But, you know, if you 
don't have water, it's bad. All right. Under Dr.

28:10.579 --> 28:17.787
Williams, did you work with John Calhoun and 
people like that? Yes. I remember John Calhoun

28:19.529 --> 28:22.852
came from Oklahoma down there. He preceded me at 
A&M. And I remember As soon as I got there, we talked

28:29.519 --> 28:31.882
to each other. I remember very well. He was... 
Engineering. Oh yeah, he was engineering. I

28:42.515 --> 28:47.280
didn't have quite as close touch with him as I did 
with some of the other ag cool things. In the

28:48.782 --> 28:55.290
department, who are the people that deserve the 
greatest credit for the growth and development of

28:56.063 --> 29:06.220
what became the Department of Horticulture and 
Floriculture? Who are the key people that deserve

29:06.240 --> 29:09.345
the credit?

29:12.310 --> 29:15.234
Perry Atkinson was as good a key as you can get. I was 
the only one that knew the history of the

29:16.136 --> 29:20.603
department. and reworked it into a, we had to have a 
history of the department. You see, Dr. Pike was

29:28.057 --> 29:44.758
there, and he wanted Dr., or Garlic Man, and we had a 
lot of people apply for head of that department,

29:28.057 --> 29:44.758
real top notch people. But we only had one 
candidate, and that was the, I can't remember his

29:50.570 --> 29:58.485
name now, but he was supported and pushed by Dr. 
Pike, and he just developed that way. We got this

29:58.505 --> 30:13.894
man, and they had been in an acting department for 
19 years, and the three of us, Homer Blackhurst,

29:58.505 --> 30:13.894
and I can't remember the other name, three of us 
were professors, And he asked us to be his sounding

30:14.667 --> 30:19.613
board. And so every time he'd ask us anything, we'd 
tell him, and he'd do the exact opposite. And every

30:25.981 --> 30:27.983
time, he got his tits from a ringer. His tail would 
crack or something else. And finally, he couldn't

30:31.087 --> 30:35.633
even get an appointment with the dean. Nobody 
would talk to him. And he finally just evaporated.

30:40.840 --> 30:47.546
As the department was growing, did you all have a 
program at some other institution you were using

30:40.840 --> 30:47.546
as a model? No. I was just using what I knew in common 
sense. Now, let me tell you what I...

30:57.875 --> 30:58.616
I had a thought there. I forgot. Oh,

30:59.917 --> 31:09.345
I had asked those... And I told you, there were nine 
academicians there. And it wasn't an academic

31:14.790 --> 31:16.292
problem. It was a management problem. And the best 
thing I had to do working for me was I asked them to

31:18.255 --> 31:26.828
give me a first, second, third choice.
