WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:03.432
He said, yes. He said, you know, my daddy brought 
them in here, and he was afraid that this was too

00:03.833 --> 00:18.990
severe a weather that they wouldn't be able to live 
in this country in the wintertime, that it would be

00:03.833 --> 00:18.990
too cold. And he said, you know, we had the shed. I 
said, yes, I remember that very well. And I said,

00:23.816 --> 00:31.405
you remember that we hitched them to the wagon, a 
little old cart that your daddy had made for us and

00:31.790 --> 00:55.182
he told us whatever we did not to run down that hill 
not to go down that hill because they wouldn't be

00:31.790 --> 00:55.182
able to hold it back he didn't have any harness that 
would hold a wagon back but you know we got in it and

00:31.790 --> 00:55.182
rode in this wagon down the hill and we turned over 
at the bottom you remember that he said yes and i

00:31.790 --> 00:55.182
said you remember i was skinned up And I didn't have 
a bit of hide left on my nose. He said, yes, I

00:58.246 --> 00:59.907
remember that. And I know that what happened to me, 
I got a spanking. And I said, well, I didn't get a

01:03.451 --> 01:10.078
spanking, but I never will forget Grandma Chapman 
putting camphor on it. And he just set me afire, and

01:10.278 --> 01:14.022
I screamed bloody murder. And she was trying to get 
the Dobie Grint out of, it just grazed my nose. It

01:20.068 --> 01:22.350
had Dobie Grint all in it. She's trying to get that 
out and clean me up, and I just thought I was ruined.

01:28.206 --> 01:31.290
And he said, that's so right. I said, do

01:31.350 --> 01:36.876
you have a picture of those goats? And he said, yes, 
I do. I said, I'd be happy if you'd send a picture of

01:39.038 --> 01:42.683
that to me. And there it is right up there. That's 
great. First Angora goats, registered Angora

01:45.656 --> 01:50.825
goats, has ever brought in to Blanco County. 
That's grand. Right there. And then, by the same

01:52.628 --> 02:00.120
token, he said, well, he said, you know how we used 
to sweat those pecans out? I said, yes, but you tell

02:00.701 --> 02:06.991
people today that you sweat pecans, and they just 
don't know what you're talking about. But what...

02:08.416 --> 02:37.782
they did they would thrash the pecans even though 
the hulls on them were still green and not yet dry

02:08.416 --> 02:37.782
enough to peel off and they would put them in a big 
box and let them go through a sweat and then they

02:08.416 --> 02:37.782
would turn dark and you could peel them that's 
right and old timers did that and he was asking me

02:08.416 --> 02:37.782
and I said yeah but now then they let them go and he 
said Well, you know, the squirrels got so many of

02:38.791 --> 02:41.274
them. I said, yes, the squirrels and the crows and 
the coons all ate on them until then. And that's the

02:47.460 --> 02:57.951
reason that old timers took them out early and took 
them off and let them go through a sweat and they put

02:47.460 --> 02:57.951
them in these boxes. And he said, well, another 
thing that has puzzled me, and I know that it

02:57.971 --> 03:06.199
happened, but I'm not able to put it all together. I 
said, well, what was that, Lou? And he said, what

03:11.481 --> 03:20.890
about the peach

03:11.481 --> 03:20.890
kernels that we, or peach seeds and the plum seeds 
we had? I said, well, we put them out and we washed

03:21.330 --> 03:33.722
them off and got all of the hide and everything, all 
the meat off of them and dried them and took them to

03:21.330 --> 03:33.722
town. and sold them. And we sold peach seeds. He 
said, do you know for what they were used for? I

03:41.970 --> 04:00.454
said, well, some were used for when they planted to 
re-bud and to re-graft, and some were used in

03:41.970 --> 04:00.454
medicines, and some were used in face cosmetics, 
and I said there were different uses of the peach

03:41.970 --> 04:00.454
kernel and the plum kernel. I really don't really 
remember, but I know that that we would always sell

04:03.925 --> 04:08.370
our peach seed. And he said, yeah, that wasn't the 
only thing we sold either, was it? And I said, to

04:12.414 --> 04:13.455
make money. I said, no, it sure wasn't. I said, we'd 
pick up every medicine bottle it was and wash it and

04:15.357 --> 04:26.087
sold medicine bottles to the drugstore for extra 
cash money. And pick up a beer bottle and sell you

04:28.510 --> 04:31.553
two. Now that's how we made our extra spending 
money. Selling bottles, peach seeds. Of course we

04:44.392 --> 04:46.255
sold our pecans.

04:49.240 --> 04:56.612
And every Saturday we'd take our butter, eggs, 
cream to town. That was extreme. Who would you sell

04:58.512 --> 04:59.514
it? Fredericksburg or Johnson City? Right here. 
In Johnson City. Right here in this little town.

05:04.842 --> 05:05.804
They'd take it off. The stores would buy it? The 
stores would buy it. And I don't know how in the

05:11.894 --> 05:15.099
world we didn't have any ice. How did they keep that 
cream? Now you tell me. I don't know. We didn't have

05:20.107 --> 05:21.369
any ice here. We brought our ice in here. by 
truckloads and big blocks of ice. But I don't

05:29.880 --> 05:37.530
remember those stores having ice to put on cream. 
But I'm sure they did because they couldn't keep it

05:37.550 --> 05:41.355
otherwise. Did they bring it up from Austin? Yeah, 
they brought it up from Austin on flatbed trucks.

05:48.563 --> 05:49.865
I'm sure, yeah. I know they did. Yeah, that they 
must have had. But that was in later years. But when

05:54.322 --> 06:00.130
we first started out, I know grandmother brought 
hers in buckets. Where'd you store eggs? Besides

06:02.312 --> 06:03.694
the cool houses. Well houses. Well houses. You had 
well houses to keep that. And I know, you know where

06:06.838 --> 06:09.521
the beauty shop is today? Yeah, right. There's a 
well behind there. Yeah. And there used to be a

06:12.044 --> 06:20.034
little house back of that that they kept all their 
eggs in. Mm-hmm. and all of the products back there

06:20.562 --> 06:29.830
in this little... That was the Witherson Spalding 
store. And it's right where the National Park

06:29.930 --> 06:33.413
Library is today. That was the Witherson Spalding 
store. And they, on the east side, on the west side

06:37.077 --> 06:48.527
rather, they had hitching posts where they were 
all lined up there and they would tie their their

06:48.946 --> 07:18.868
horses and their things there and that little 
alley between and it's still there today between

06:48.946 --> 07:18.868
Withers and Spalding store and the bank well they 
would have part of that cut off and that was all

06:48.946 --> 07:18.868
cemented and had that rock wall against it and they 
would put their put extra eggs out there and extra

06:48.946 --> 07:18.868
poultry and things in that little alley To keep it 
cool. Keep it cool. Sure. Well, let me ask you

07:24.093 --> 07:25.795
another question. I know I've talked to you about 
the, what about the, you know, we were talking

07:25.915 --> 07:30.079
about the peddlers. They used to come up here? 
Yeah. That's sort of trading. What? Tell us some

07:34.324 --> 07:41.511
more about that, because recently we met somebody 
whose great-grand, great-uncle was a peddler out

07:34.324 --> 07:41.511
of San Antonio. Well, they came, they used to come 
up this way. Yeah, they would always come through

07:43.993 --> 07:48.518
here, and they had certain, certain of time to come 
maybe it would be on mondays or and fridays and they

07:48.937 --> 08:14.033
would come through here but they didn't come every 
week it'd probably be every two weeks they would

07:48.937 --> 08:14.033
come and they would take anything that you had to 
sell it would be butter eggs chickens turkeys uh

08:14.452 --> 08:21.340
anything, vegetables, marketing goods, 
anything you had to sell, and they would trade it to

08:14.452 --> 08:21.340
you. Well, we had no place to buy shoes. We had no 
place to buy little dresses for children or little

08:24.002 --> 08:30.089
coats. And I'll never forget the first pair of 
little shoes that I can remember that I cherished

08:30.109 --> 08:42.923
with all my heart was a little pair of, patent 
leather shoes with red tops. And they were laced

08:46.871 --> 08:49.414
up. And Margaret got a pair. I got a pair of black 
ones with red tops. And Margaret got a pair of black

08:54.098 --> 08:56.841
ones with white tops. And we thought they were the 
cutest things that ever was. And they were. And my

09:02.967 --> 09:11.796
mother traded them some chickens and some butter 
and some eggs. to buy these shoes and what we called

09:12.282 --> 09:41.749
a bear skin coat and it was imitation fur mine was a 
red and Margaret's was a brown and they were really

09:12.282 --> 09:41.749
pretty little coats and they had a little head 
thing that we called well it was a it had a

09:44.902 --> 10:14.284
pom-pom on the top of it and it came up to a point in 
the top and it was really a pretty cute outfit and

09:44.902 --> 10:14.284
the collar buttoned up close around the neck where 
you didn't have any cold air to get through and the

09:44.902 --> 10:14.284
head had a little cord that you pull down here that 
fit tight around your neck and you pull it around

09:44.902 --> 10:14.284
your head and put it down and you look like just like 
a little Pekingese

10:14.872 --> 10:22.701
thing with that pointed tail up and the pom-pom on 
the top of it. But it was real cute. And it just

10:24.423 --> 10:30.991
matched my shoes and my little cap and thing. And I 
well remember her paying for it with chickens and

10:31.011 --> 10:39.021
butter and eggs. And then another thing that I 
remember quite so well, they brought a little

10:39.582 --> 10:44.828
stove by and they sold also stoles for the farm 
people to buy and it was the cutest thing that ever

10:46.090 --> 11:14.578
was and he'd show how the how you could push the the 
how compact it was that the smoke would go up this

10:46.090 --> 11:14.578
way and out the out the regular uh stove pipe rather 
than coming out all around the sides how well it was

11:15.014 --> 11:19.080
put together and it was called Home Comfort Stove. 
And they sold between four and five hundred

11:19.942 --> 11:24.829
dollars. Now that was many, many moons ago. That 
was when I was just a little girl. About how old?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.343
Well, let me see. We moved down here in 12. And I 
would have been, that was when I was about six years

11:36.407 --> 11:41.275
old. And they sold at that price then, and you said, 
well, you were so young, how do you remember that?

11:48.209 --> 11:58.809
Well, I was taught from the word gold, the value of a 
dollar by my mother, and how much it meant, and how

11:48.209 --> 11:58.809
many it took to do this, and how many. I knew. And 
when he said it would cost that much, I knew that we

12:04.120 --> 12:06.743
that that was impossible for us to buy. And I never 
will forget telling the man, I said, well, we don't

12:06.783 --> 12:12.108
have that kind of money. And he said, he looked at me 
and he said, well, how do you know? And I looked up at

12:16.813 --> 12:21.899
my mother and I said, mother, do we have that? She 
said, no, darling, we sure don't. And he couldn't

12:25.342 --> 12:30.988
understand why I would know that we didn't have 
that kind of money. Well, my mother taught me from

12:31.373 --> 12:39.665
the time I was old enough to talk that we didn't have 
too much. And we didn't buy anything with what we

12:41.628 --> 12:45.032
could pay for. He was a person that wanted to be 
loved more than anything in this world. In

12:53.024 --> 12:54.406
history. He comes off very much, in the Miller 
book, he comes off as somebody who comes off as very

12:59.892 --> 13:23.520
compassionate in a way oh yes when he was teaching 
in katula oh he was and he up until his dying day he

12:59.892 --> 13:23.520
was a very compassionate person but he also he also 
comes across as somebody who will manipulate and

12:59.892 --> 13:23.520
step on toes and knock in other words i was what was i 
saying to you the other night in other words

12:59.892 --> 13:23.520
they're He'll just knock over anybody he can to get 
the point that he wants to make and do it. He's

13:30.747 --> 13:31.608
always done it. He comes off as one of the most, and 
this isn't my opinion, but this is just an

13:31.628 --> 13:37.375
impression I've gotten from the Miller book. He 
comes off as one of the most

13:37.395 --> 13:45.064
politically manipulative people in the century. 
They can say whatever they want to, but he could

13:45.104 --> 13:50.470
manipulate, he could manipulate persuasively. 
You could probably talk somebody into jumping off

13:50.635 --> 13:54.642
a bridge without a life raft. Absolutely. He could 
do it. And he did do it. Yeah. And he comes off as very

13:58.528 --> 14:12.491
politically astute, almost, some people might 
say unethical, where he would not vote a certain

13:58.528 --> 14:12.491
way until he felt it would be politically 
advantageous for him to vote a certain way. Sure.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.794
That's what the Miller book really makes a strong 
point. And that's exactly right. Johnson, he,

14:17.011 --> 14:18.713
what did he do? Oh yeah, with the McCarthy 
hearings, the army McCarthy hearings, the way

14:18.933 --> 14:31.248
Lyndon would not, he just kept his mouth shut, 
didn't say what he felt until he felt the country

14:18.933 --> 14:31.248
was ready to start censuring McCarthy. And then 
all of a sudden he came out and, you know, censured

14:31.828 --> 14:35.473
McCarthy. But until that, even though according 
to the people quoted in the book, he disagreed very

14:36.133 --> 14:46.005
much with what McCarthy was doing, he kept quiet 
because he figured the people of Texas You know,

14:47.082 --> 14:51.027
we're not ready for that. Manipulator. Well, if 
the book succeeds in that, though, that's one

14:52.949 --> 14:56.913
thing I'll say. Again, I'm coming from ignorance, 
based on what I knew, reading newspapers about him

14:56.933 --> 15:04.101
as president and so forth. But if one of Miller's 
purposes was to picture him as a Mr. Politician,

15:10.148 --> 15:15.975
and I'll step on anybody to get my point across and 
to can persuade anybody then it does the job

15:16.360 --> 15:41.001
because again I don't know what was accurate or 
inaccurate about his childhood because that's

15:16.360 --> 15:41.001
well anyway I tell you that was the main thing and uh 
we were poor there was no question about it but of

15:16.360 --> 15:41.001
course his sister says we were not that we had as 
much as anybody we may have had as much but by golly

15:16.360 --> 15:41.001
is that a blessing or not I was old enough to know. 
And let me tell you, when you get up in the morning

15:44.416 --> 15:56.870
and you don't have anything to eat but cornbread 
and cream gravy, you know the times are hard. And we

15:58.152 --> 16:01.135
lived on the ranch. And it was hard times. Our 
cattle were not fat enough to be slaughtered. The

16:08.724 --> 16:10.887
deer were not fat enough to eat. back in the 20s back 
in the 80s 30s listen it was rough going and we'd

16:12.588 --> 16:42.190
kill cottontail rabbits and that would be our meat 
every once in a while we'd find a fat coon and he

16:12.588 --> 16:42.190
never forgot that no and let me tell you They can say 
what they want to. But that was the thing that stuck

16:44.668 --> 16:57.401
in Lyndon Johnson's craw was the hardships that we 
went through as children and for eating and for

16:44.668 --> 16:57.401
cooking. Listen, we had to pay for our education. 
We had to buy our own books. We didn't have free

17:05.108 --> 17:07.591
books when we went to school. We bought our books. 
And they were not the books that were the latest off

17:11.330 --> 17:17.138
of the press, they were the ones that you could get 
the most of for that particular class. And they may

17:18.320 --> 17:21.064
have been back in 1895. I've got a scholar that was 
1895 that I had in the fifth grade. I've got

17:29.557 --> 17:34.964
arithmetic that was put out with Sutton and Bruce 
that I loaned to the library. That was copyrighted

17:37.248 --> 17:40.172
in 1890. And those are the books that you grew up 
using? That was the books that I grew up using. The

17:45.042 --> 17:49.566
Blueback Scholar and Sutton Bruce's Arithmetic. 
And I went to school to a Mrs. Bruce that was a sister

17:49.586 --> 18:05.099
to the man that was author of this Arithmetic in 
Southwest Norman.

18:06.881 --> 18:09.163
That's how old she was. Ms. Bruce. How about that? 
So your education was what they could pull

18:11.892 --> 18:14.754
together. And so Melissa was his. And we paid for 
our education. We only had a seven-month school

18:19.578 --> 18:23.282
year. And two months of it was paid tuition. I can 
only remember one time going to school with paid

18:27.445 --> 18:30.908
tuition. My mother was a teacher and my daddy was a 
teacher. And I stayed at home those two months and

18:33.731 --> 18:38.475
studied. And then when preschool opened for five 
months, I went to school for five months and made a

18:38.776 --> 18:48.168
grade in five months.

18:48.488 --> 18:58.821
The thing is, we've sort of systemized everything 
that we lose touch with the fact that people in the

18:48.488 --> 18:58.821
community life still take one career and stick 
with it for the rest of their lives. You don't have

18:58.841 --> 19:02.265
to be a jack-of-all-trades in your education. 
Again, who's teaching and who's not this year,

19:03.587 --> 19:05.850
right? I look back Of course, I know that Kitty Pie 
and I were talking the other night. See, I'm four

19:14.751 --> 19:17.717
years older than she is. And she said, you know, 
when I think about it, we have been a wonderful

19:18.398 --> 19:24.310
family. I said, we sure have. And we have seen the 
change. and the times that have gone and come. And I

19:32.853 --> 19:38.963
said, no other generation has had as many changes 
as you and I have seen. I said, how many times have we

19:40.425 --> 19:54.127
ridden on a freight wagon from here to Austin, 
pulling bales of cotton to the market to be shipped

19:40.425 --> 19:54.127
to Galveston? That's where our market was, 
Galveston. You

19:55.996 --> 20:05.044
heard that old saying, sleep in the wagon yard? We 
slept in the wagon yard. Leonard East Wagon Yard,

20:07.987 --> 20:15.894
down the old first street.

20:15.914 --> 20:16.835
Golly. Here, I've met every astronaut that has 
ever been up. Right here at this little town.

20:31.710 --> 20:39.132
From the man on the moon to the wagon train to 
Austin.

20:39.652 --> 20:40.875
Maybe you change. Well, you know, the people who 
have come out of your generation, Ava, and people

20:41.576 --> 20:50.475
who have come up in mine since World War II, I mean, 
we don't know. I mean, I'm lucky. My family was your

20:51.898 --> 20:53.702
generation. Yeah. And since I was an 
afterthought, an accident down the line, so I see a

20:54.363 --> 21:00.276
bridge with your generation. The majority of 
people that are my age are not. No. Then they're

21:03.703 --> 21:05.165
children are not. No. Yeah. And it's quite a loss of 
that identity that America changed right here in

21:06.687 --> 21:13.537
your generation. Harvey was telling me, he says, 
mother, he said, I want to tell you something.

21:18.304 --> 21:22.450
Well, I told you about riding a racehorse. for Roy 
Stubbs. And he took this horse and sold it for $500

21:25.775 --> 21:30.886
for a polo pony. He said, I was in San Antonio a 
couple weeks ago to see the doctor and he said,

21:31.727 --> 21:43.371
Mother, I want to take you out and show you Roy 
Stubbs' polo patch that he still has, still

21:31.727 --> 21:43.371
operating. He's 90. 92 years old. Still operating 
it in San Antonio. And he said, I said, well, don't.

21:52.140 --> 21:53.822
I said, that is okay. And so Roy told Corky about me 
riding his horse and me getting sent to Smith, old

21:53.842 --> 22:01.389
Atlanta. And that Atlanta polo team was number one 
in Texas. And here I am, a country girl, standing on

22:07.054 --> 22:13.800
the sideline watching the races. And Roy Stubbs 
walks up to my daddy and says, I don't have a rider

22:14.202 --> 22:20.770
for my horse and I need one. He said, I've got a rider 
for you right here. My daddy said that. And he said,

22:25.739 --> 22:27.240
who? He said, Little Ava. And I stand there looking 
over the fence at these horses getting old. I just

22:33.506 --> 22:35.708
heard him say Little Ava, and I turned around. And 
he said, go get your boots on. I said, but I'm free.

22:39.551 --> 22:42.214
My boots is in the wagon, not with a hat. And I went 
and got my boots. And he said, do you have any spurs?

22:48.799 --> 22:50.841
I said, no, I didn't bring any spurs. Roy said, I got 
a pair. Well, you know what pole spurs are. They

22:55.659 --> 22:57.142
just have a knob on them. They don't have any gears. 
Just a knob. And I said, has this horse ever been

23:00.186 --> 23:04.172
ridden with pole spurs? Roy said, no. I said, well, 
she may throw a nuclear over that fence. He said,

23:08.378 --> 23:10.281
oh, no, I don't think so. I said, well, we better try 
before I get out there on that track. You know, with

23:14.997 --> 23:18.261
the poles first. And so we turned around two or 
three times, and Karen and I did it with the poles

23:18.281 --> 23:24.288
first. And she just put a figure eight in that tail 
and just whirled it. And I knew if I didn't turn many

23:27.613 --> 23:31.197
times, she'd throw me the tail over the fence. I 
knew that, you know, when I'd see that tail with me.

23:36.974 --> 23:40.299
Roy, I got on, and I rode her out. And just about the 
time I got better than a little halfway, I heard my

23:40.961 --> 23:47.612
daddy holler out, put the bug to her sister. And I 
knew what that meant. It meant to whip her up. And

23:52.580 --> 24:00.092
old Roy said, give her the reins, give her the 
reins. Well, I knew if I gave her the reins and then

24:00.192 --> 24:03.117
hit her, that I'd never stop when I got to the end. I 
didn't think I would, that we'd just keep going.

24:11.755 --> 24:17.781
But I did just what they told me, because they 
seemed to be knowing. Well, we didn't stop at the

24:17.801 --> 24:19.423
gate. We just hurtled that gate just as pretty as it 
pleased and just kept circling.

24:27.971 --> 24:31.855
But I grabbed the reins, I'll guarantee you. But we 
didn't even stop at the skater. I'll never forget

24:36.851 --> 24:38.253
that. But to think the polo pins are still 
operating the same thing. And it always still

24:43.820 --> 24:46.824
takes horses down it. That's something else. For 
life, for you. I think that's the whole thing. It's

24:59.660 --> 25:01.723
the idea that It was a time that it all happened, and 
you were just a part of the community. That's all it

25:09.072 --> 25:10.013
means.

25:12.756 --> 25:14.238
And you lived and let live. You helped your 
neighbor. Well, what did I get out of riding like a

25:17.021 --> 25:20.545
drunk Indian? I got nothing out of it. That's a good 
story. Well, what did that mean to him? Nothing. It

25:29.114 --> 25:31.677
was just, you know, he needed a rider. And I got 
nothing out of it, and you were helping out

25:32.872 --> 25:37.024
somebody. That's all it is in the end.

25:46.304 --> 25:49.489
Just like it was burying people across the river. 
Why they wouldn't dare let a girl do that today?

25:52.734 --> 25:54.617
They'd be afraid she'd fall off and drown. Don't 
you think of yourself, that's one thing I think you

25:54.738 --> 25:58.283
know my feelings. They've done an excellent 
exhibit about women in Texas. I think we've talked

26:02.410 --> 26:04.253
about it before. There are women who've made their 
way into the cultural limelight of Texas. And

26:09.862 --> 26:16.954
beneath them are the women who have sort of held the 
state together. The state tradition. And the

26:19.198 --> 26:20.280
state tradition. And that tradition has not been 
one of the aristocracy. No, it has not been. It has

26:26.991 --> 26:30.958
been one of hardship, one of sacrifice. And 
experiences that I think only are conditional to

26:31.816 --> 26:37.785
the clients. That's right. Because there was no 
freely-mailing. I mean, some of the things that is

26:42.331 --> 26:47.298
being a rancher's wife is being a rancher. I mean, 
that's right. They are a farmer's wife. You're a

26:50.182 --> 26:50.903
farmer. You have a dual identity there that is 
not... stereotypical to the female role that

26:55.390 --> 27:05.280
we're, I think, giving all the credit to these 
women here in Texas. That's something that I can't

27:06.120 --> 27:08.943
understand today. They feel like that a woman that 
does these things today is really

27:09.564 --> 27:22.756
not in the cultural up and up. She's believing in 
herself. My land, I can remember when I'd sit on an

27:27.003 --> 27:38.095
old disc plow driving four mules all day long and 
plowing in the field. I didn't think there was

27:39.837 --> 27:41.900
anything wrong in it. I was helping my daddy make a 
living. I'd get on a cultivator. I could set a

27:47.145 --> 27:48.667
cultivator. They don't know what setting a 
cultivator is today. You have to set those those

27:53.390 --> 28:02.239
little plows to where they just go exactly by that, 
by the stalk of cotton or this corn. And you have a

28:03.060 --> 28:08.566
notch that you put that mold in, and you regulate 
it. And you get out there, and you see just how close

28:08.586 --> 28:14.031
you want to throw that dirt, and just how far. And 
that's what you call . You talk about that today to a

28:15.893 --> 28:20.798
person, What are the numbers of women in 
agriculture in A&M? I wonder what they are. And the

28:26.024 --> 28:29.929
women, their mothers, who were 
agriculturalists. I'm having to learn again. I

28:32.873 --> 28:34.094
just don't understand. And when I went to A&M, I 
went down there one summer. And I took tanning and

28:40.602 --> 28:45.148
curing meat. And let's see, home canning, 
carrying meat, and marketing. Yeah. No sense

28:55.777 --> 28:58.381
pertaining to culture? Absolutely nothing. 
That's where I lived and what I did. Right, it was a

29:02.508 --> 29:04.772
necessity for me to know this. It was a necessity. 
And it was short course. And you know, if a woman

29:07.716 --> 29:15.769
went down there in the 30s and 40s to take that, that 
burn, they were just almost ostracized. Now, I'm

29:15.790 --> 29:17.332
not kidding you one. That's right. And they looked 
at you. But these were special courses that I even

29:21.241 --> 29:25.065
offered for extension services. For extension 
services, and I went

29:25.105 --> 29:37.217
and took them. I think one of them cost me $90. I know 
it wasn't an awful expensive thing because we

29:39.659 --> 29:44.744
didn't have it. But what I did, I paid for it. In a 
summer's time, the old food jar company hired me to

29:47.887 --> 29:59.897
put on demonstrations to use their jars to canvass 
and I paid for it. Where did you do these

29:59.917 --> 30:01.180
demonstrations? Right down here at the hardware 
store. And at the different club meetings

30:05.386 --> 30:09.653
throughout the county. Sort of like the 
Tupperware lady. You just go from community to

30:13.159 --> 30:21.994
community and you go to someone's house and you put 
on these demonstrations, sell the jars. Oh,

30:22.548 --> 30:30.480
honey, I've done everything from Cape Cod to 
Hickory Den that was honest and honest to make a

30:22.548 --> 30:30.480
living, to get by. Milk cows, milk 24-headed cows 
day and morning and night. We sell milk in this

30:35.988 --> 30:37.590
town. She didn't have any. But as I say, you're not 
alone. There are other people here, like

30:41.587 --> 30:45.010
yourself, who have to do the same thing. And again, 
this is the environment that, you know, they miss,

30:45.530 --> 30:51.536
that they look at, or they don't see. And you pick 
yourself up with the bootstraps and say, it's a

30:51.676 --> 30:56.100
better way. I can do that. But you didn't decide to 
teach until late in life, really. No, I didn't.

31:02.887 --> 31:05.229
Now, how long until you decided to go back to 
college? Well... I'll tell you, I went back in 48,

31:07.368 --> 31:16.881
in the summer of 48, and took my first 12 hours of 
school. And I stood that summer for an emergency

31:17.022 --> 31:23.451
certificate. And I got it for six years. If you made 
an average of 85, you could get it for six years. So I

31:30.380 --> 31:35.147
had 18 subjects that I took. And I got it for six 
years. I came back up here and I started teaching. I

31:43.729 --> 31:45.652
taught in the fall of 48. And in 50,

31:48.157 --> 31:56.713
I walked down the aisle. With my diploma from 
Trinity University, my BS degree. You have to go on

32:04.554 --> 32:06.558
school nights, right? And going every night, 
teaching all day and going every night to school.

32:10.627 --> 32:13.172
Then, and that was in 50. Then I said, well, I'm 
through. And my husband said, oh, no, you're not. I

32:17.804 --> 32:19.446
said, the heck, I'm not. I'm tired and I'm going to 
quit. He said, no, you're not. You're going after

32:22.670 --> 32:24.112
that master's. I said, oh, well, I don't care 
whether I ever get a master's. No, you're going

32:27.857 --> 32:33.324
to. So in 1951,

32:33.584 --> 32:43.457
I started after my master's degree in January. In 
1952, I had my master's degree. Taught school

32:48.760 --> 32:50.162
every day. Never attended a... I attended summer, 
one summer, in college. And you went back to

32:58.394 --> 33:00.257
Southwest Texas for that? Mm-hmm. But you always 
made contributions to make to Southwest Texas.

33:06.966 --> 33:07.167
Huh? You made contributions as a student. Oh, 
yeah. I know. You brought as much into your work

33:10.872 --> 33:13.596
as... You got out of it. I guess I did. I've heard. I 
know when I was working on my master's that I was

33:21.598 --> 33:37.895
elected

33:21.598 --> 33:37.895
assistant professor to Ms. Theria, head of the 
geography department.

33:37.915 --> 33:38.716
I enjoyed that. I enjoyed it a lot.

33:44.508 --> 33:51.055
When did you hold office, maybe, here as 
superintendent of the school? Uh-huh. Where were

33:51.275 --> 33:53.817
you superintendent of the school? Let's see, in 
1935, 1936. This is before you finished your

33:56.100 --> 34:00.744
education. Well, shoot, I just had, when I didn't, 
I was out of a step that I just go down and take the

34:00.764 --> 34:07.811
examination and start all over. Never go to 
school. Mm-hmm.

34:15.170 --> 34:20.237
That's critical, but that's the way it happened. 
That's the way it was done. Yeah, that's the way it

34:21.738 --> 34:25.303
was done. Education in rural Texas is something 
else, something else. It was a makeshift faculty.

34:32.012 --> 34:33.634
It sure was.

34:37.879 --> 34:42.325
What about our first school here in 1923?

34:44.448 --> 34:48.555
What do you think about that? Well, I had 20, 27 in my 
room. I had 6 and 7, 3. 6 and 7. And those two vases

34:59.956 --> 35:07.089
right up there, those green ones on that top shelf, 
was given to me by the two groups. They're frosted

35:07.670 --> 35:12.079
glass and they would be real expensive.

35:16.186 --> 35:18.150
Was Johnson City bigger than it is now? I mean, the 
community? Well, yes. Yes, it had more people

35:24.402 --> 35:27.406
here. In 1890, there was more people in the county 
than there are today. What is the county

35:34.175 --> 35:36.578
population today? Well, I'll imagine if. Where 
did you get that? She probably had it hidden for a

35:42.486 --> 35:47.333
week under the bed. But what a presentation.

35:52.049 --> 35:56.274
Why

35:52.049 --> 35:56.274
not? Trouble? You want to get this bone and get back 
in your room?

36:04.382 --> 36:06.605
Yes, I'm ashamed of you. I'm really ashamed of you. 
Mommy didn't know you was that kind of a baby. No,

36:10.128 --> 36:10.829
she didn't. She knew you was a little dog with a 
little bone, but she didn't think you'd go back in

36:10.849 --> 36:15.674
the house. Well, in 19...

36:22.458 --> 36:51.925
20 and 18 and 90 we had over 5,000

36:22.458 --> 36:51.925
in the county and I think today counting the old 
that's those who are not to pay poll tax you know the

36:22.458 --> 36:51.925
overs and the unders I think we might have 4,000

36:52.799 --> 37:09.798
As you said, my observation, because of the war 
between Blanco and Johnson, particularly over

36:52.799 --> 37:09.798
the courthouse, I've noticed that the only 
courthouse in Texas that doesn't have benches out

36:52.799 --> 37:09.798
front and people sitting around it. So we're aware 
of that. Have you ever thought about that? There

37:13.201 --> 37:20.049
are no benches, and I was going to ask you, how has 
that placed out through history? When did it

37:20.309 --> 37:22.131
change, or... Well, that's quite a few, between 
Johnson, Simpson, and Planko. That is. But they

37:28.908 --> 37:46.718
decided in 19

37:28.908 --> 37:46.718
and 13 that there would be no snuff-dipping, 
chewing, and What not do I have? A courthouse

37:48.279 --> 37:53.177
spitman, which is characteristic around other 
Texas courthouses. Oh, so 1913, more or less. They

37:59.624 --> 38:08.540
started to up-build this town in 1915, and they 
were getting ready to vote the liquor out. Oh, they

38:08.560 --> 38:09.201
were. Oh, yes, they were back and doing all that, 
you know, building up to it. Of course, they didn't

38:14.891 --> 38:22.965
do that until 1970, but they were building up to it, 
you know, working on it and getting it. And the

38:22.945 --> 38:27.751
movement, church movement, was very strong. And 
everything was...

38:27.992 --> 38:36.263
What was the strongest church in this community at 
that time? Well, I guess the Christian church. Was

38:38.646 --> 38:39.127
it? By far the strongest. And then by 19 and 22...

38:51.515 --> 38:52.916
The Methodist Church. Yeah. And then by 19,

38:54.437 --> 39:04.326
well, the Baptist Church just really has hung on, 
just barely hanging. Mm-hmm. But in the last,

39:04.506 --> 39:14.655
well, in the last four years, it's picked up, and 
they do have a nice congregation now. Mm-hmm. But

39:15.676 --> 39:20.560
they were not starting to start with the Christian 
and the Methodist. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We had a

39:22.278 --> 39:32.814
church, what do you call it, Pentecostal church or 
Apostolic or whatever you want to call it. We've

39:32.915 --> 39:35.699
had one of those ever since 1915. There are a few, 
but always had one.

39:41.949 --> 39:47.998
We just had the first Catholic church built in here 
in 1940. A question, what about, these are just

39:48.721 --> 39:57.441
things I keep wanting to ask you, what about 
segregation in the community? We have not. You

40:00.167 --> 40:02.693
just don't even hear it ever mentioned. Okay. but 
there were not some big black community here no

40:03.588 --> 40:32.498
there's not any there aren't any black there's no 
black neighborhood there's no members around

40:03.588 --> 40:32.498
here this is a totally black absolutely county or 
no no no after the civil war and this is something

40:03.588 --> 40:32.498
else blanco county is the only county in the south 
that followed through exactly as the rules asked

40:03.588 --> 40:32.498
that every uh male and female, 21 years of age, 
given a plow, Georgia stock plow, a mule, and 20

40:33.710 --> 40:44.324
acres of land. They did that, and they put them over 
in the county, in the south end of the county. They

40:49.251 --> 40:57.422
bought the land, and these Negroes would have to 
preempted that land before it was given to them.

40:57.976 --> 41:06.190
And then after they had lived on it a number of years 
after, they could have it as theirs. But no white

41:06.210 --> 41:11.399
person could ever buy a foot of that land. So long as 
any of its lenient descendants lived, it was

41:11.419 --> 41:15.867
theirs. And it is still there. It is still there. 
And they can't get a clear title to anything that

41:18.253 --> 41:21.538
they've got over there. Now, we've had a couple 
come in here from the north and bought up some land,

41:21.579 --> 41:30.434
but they don't have a title to it. No way can they get 
a title

41:30.454 --> 41:35.803
to it. And these neighbors kept the names. of their 
masters that mourned them. Now we've got a bunch of

41:42.041 --> 41:44.925
Johnson neighbors over there. We've got a bunch of 
Crownover neighbors, and Calfin neighbors from

41:44.945 --> 41:53.097
their masters. And we have Easter Crownover going 
on Easter morning, and her name's Easter

41:53.117 --> 42:00.388
Crownover. And, you know, just They have a Spanish 
population here, but that's most of the people who

42:02.911 --> 42:08.478
come in, wouldn't you say? They came here, well, 
most of the Mexicans that are here came here with

42:08.639 --> 42:18.071
ranchers. You're right. It started out in this 
country. Yeah, there's some old Spanish families

42:21.736 --> 42:24.880
around here. Yeah, old, old Spanish families. 
They came with the Spanish farmhand. Yes, they

42:28.745 --> 42:29.406
did. They worked, yeah. Now, the Riberas over at 
Round Mountain is one of them. And that woman,

42:34.883 --> 42:36.004
Cookie. Yeah, I know her. Berna. Berna. Is another 
one. Her parents came here. And I called her, and

42:42.070 --> 42:44.953
I'm like, yeah. I thought I remember teaching her. 
That is. Well, yeah, it is. You'll come back up here

42:53.141 --> 42:56.525
and say, my Lord, wonderful. How many more? But you 
know, I... It makes me feel good, even though they

42:58.970 --> 43:08.206
may not have done the best to base you there. But 
just to say, well, yeah, that's normal. Just like

43:13.254 --> 43:14.256
old Charlie. I used to have to bust him just as 
regular as the week went by. He never went a week

43:19.525 --> 43:21.168
without a spanking. I don't guess I ever did. I know 
you, but I just didn't place you. I didn't think

43:29.393 --> 43:33.477
anybody would forget me. And when he remembered, 
he remembered. Yeah, he remembered. And just like

43:38.162 --> 43:41.886
this, I had him on the fourth grade.

43:46.111 --> 43:47.752
He just carried a lot of esteem. Didn't they? Well, 
old teachers never die, honey. They just lose

43:52.480 --> 43:54.126
their class. Or they just grade away.

44:02.217 --> 44:07.484
But there's lots of consolation in being a 
teacher. If you enjoy teaching, and I did. I

44:10.768 --> 44:12.190
enjoyed my school. I loved my kids. They were 
honest, but I loved them. And I remember. I

44:19.619 --> 44:21.201
remember the good things. I remember the bad 
things. But most of all, the kind things. I really

44:25.547 --> 44:28.390
did.

44:31.755 --> 44:32.055
But that I've had a hard, hard life. A hard life. But 
I've had a rich life. A lot richer than my son or my

44:41.792 --> 44:47.358
grandchildren or whatever I am. I agree. Just a lot

44:48.639 --> 44:54.424
richer. I agree. And you know why? And I why? I've 
seen on health and life through death. I know.

45:01.110 --> 45:01.671
And... What do you think gave you your incentive to 
just really up and be so different? Well, I saw my

45:10.879 --> 45:15.843
mother just have to slave like a man. And I made up my 
mind that life had to have more than anything.

45:23.610 --> 45:31.337
She'd put a pear burner on her back and burn the pear 
all day long to keep them from starting to die. come

45:31.688 --> 45:35.857
home, cook, and get us off to school of a morning. We 
have to get up at 5 o'clock and leave the house by 6 in

45:35.958 --> 45:41.450
order to get up here to school. Ride 5 miles, 
horseback, and open 7 gates. And you just don't do

45:45.940 --> 45:51.452
that in 30 minutes time. And that was meant to pack 
your lunch and see that you had an overcoat or

45:51.668 --> 46:04.540
raincoat or you had your slicker or you had your 
chaps to go over or whatnot to keep the cold off. She

46:04.700 --> 46:06.822
had a hard life. She was an intelligent, smart 
woman. She was wise beyond her years. She was just

46:20.980 --> 46:30.071
I look back and wish to goodness that I had half the 
brain matter she has. And I just made up my mind that

46:30.091 --> 46:41.965
there's bound to be a better way.

46:41.985 --> 46:46.971
And I started out washing dishes. in a boarding 
house after school. Two days, one evening. From

46:55.617 --> 46:58.962
that, I did that for a year. The next year, I worked 
in a grocery store.

47:04.910 --> 47:05.831
That's 12 years old. A clerk in a grocery store. 
After school, and on Saturday.
