WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:09.544
name, your maiden name, and the whole work, 
please, and how you came to be here, to that city.

00:09.564 --> 00:12.767
Elizabeth Ann Harper John. Elizabeth Ann Harper 
John, hence the Elizabeth A.H. John under which I

00:12.827 --> 00:18.334
publish. I was born and reared in a little county 
seat town, Marika, just across the Red River. And

00:29.883 --> 00:41.860
as an undergraduate history major, I was working 
for an honors project, honors thesis, at Oklahoma

00:29.883 --> 00:41.860
College for Women, which no longer exists under 
that name. It's now called Oklahoma University of

00:41.880 --> 00:47.529
Sciences and Arts. And it's co-educational, 
which I think is a bad move. But at any rate, I

00:51.753 --> 01:07.095
started trying to document or to explain why every 
time they plow down in the southeastern corner, of

01:07.666 --> 01:29.914
Jefferson

01:07.666 --> 01:29.914
County, and across the river in Montague County, 
they turned up incredible quantities of the

01:07.666 --> 01:29.914
plants, which I now know to be Indian, French, and 
to a lesser degree, Spanish. And so I, nobody had

01:29.934 --> 01:32.998
ever explained those things, and so I began 
researching them. And that led me into this field.

01:36.436 --> 01:42.643
And I discovered that they had been Wichita and 
Calvias villages. And so trying to track those

01:42.663 --> 01:54.518
Indians and understand what was going on led me 
into the wonderful world of the Spanish

01:42.663 --> 01:54.518
documents. And starting with that kind of 
question, there's just never been any answer to

01:54.538 --> 02:01.146
that. So it's

02:01.548 --> 02:11.141
just been tremendously rewarding. But by the time 
I finished my PhD at the University of Oklahoma at

02:11.161 --> 02:20.714
Max Warhead, when I'd also done a master's degree 
on the thesis, I mean on the Tau Bias. The master's

02:20.734 --> 02:25.420
was in 51. The PhD was in 57. But by that time... No, I 
never knew him. He was there later. I know of him,

02:39.785 --> 02:42.989
because I have heard of him. But is he at A&M now? No, 
he's dead. He retired about 10 years ago, 15, and

02:46.793 --> 02:52.240
moved to Colorado, and he died. Didn't he have a 
wife named Donnie? Originally, yes, and he

02:55.103 --> 02:58.167
divorced about 10, came to A&M. Oh, and there was 
that, oh yes, I remember, there was another woman

02:58.400 --> 03:04.193
there. This was, oh yes, I remember. Yes, there was 
tension. Yes, I remember that. But the reason I

03:09.646 --> 03:13.354
knew her name was that she was a close friend of 
Amy's. Okay, yes, that's right, because I knew

03:14.178 --> 03:24.656
Dottie, we had met Dottie, you know, when I first 
moved out, I liked her very much, and the next thing

03:14.178 --> 03:24.656
I know, all this grew up in me. Right, and it put Max 
in a very unfortunate position. He was very

03:28.704 --> 03:37.679
uncomfortable, because I believe that the woman 
whose name escapes me was representing herself as

03:28.704 --> 03:37.679
a Moorhead student. Yeah, that's right. But,

03:40.402 --> 03:48.995
all the shitheads in class is what they were. And 
actually Max had to marry Houston. But, at any

03:50.277 --> 03:56.646
rate, I met and married Peter at the university. By 
the time I finished my PhD, We were off in New

03:57.968 --> 04:06.739
Mexico, where his first job was after he finished 
his doctorate. At the University of New Mexico?

04:08.100 --> 04:09.562
The University of New Mexico, yeah. And I finished 
my dissertation there, commuting to the Argos,

04:09.742 --> 04:20.055
which was a wonderful... That's a perfect place 
for another kind of interest. I couldn't have been

04:20.075 --> 04:21.757
luckier. But by the time I finished the doctorate, 
I had two emmits. Peter

04:27.179 --> 04:48.034
quite properly decided that the University of New 
Mexico was not a place to build

04:27.179 --> 04:48.034
buildings. And they bailed out two industries in 
California. So we moved to California in 1957. And

04:51.360 --> 04:51.921
then... Where did he go? He went with the Chevron 
Research Company standard oil at Richmond,

04:52.390 --> 05:04.316
which, of course, placed me just up the road from 
the Babcock Library. Yeah. Uh-huh. Wonderful

05:05.780 --> 05:06.541
luck. And within a year, Peter was in addition to 
his full-time job at At Chevron, he was also a

05:12.337 --> 05:27.503
visiting part-time professor of statistics, 
assistant professor of statistics at UC

05:12.337 --> 05:27.503
Berkeley's stat

05:12.337 --> 05:27.503
department. And so those were very interesting 
years for us, living in the Bay Area then. I had

05:32.711 --> 05:38.361
children in the Berkeley Cooperative Nursery 
School once they were old enough and I had time off.

05:38.645 --> 05:41.532
I was in the main bar. And then there was an opening 
for him full time up at UC Davis. So we moved up

05:49.170 --> 05:50.393
there. Do you like the switch from industry to 
academia? Oh, I think he's an incorrigible . But

06:01.309 --> 06:07.755
he's very grateful for his industrial 
experience, and he learned so much, and he's still

06:01.309 --> 06:07.755
using it. As a statistician, he does a lot of 
industrial consulting, actually, and has a

06:07.855 --> 06:19.485
comprehension of it that he

06:07.855 --> 06:19.485
wouldn't have if he'd stayed that deep all his 
life. Davis, where

06:21.052 --> 06:32.548
we were from 61 to 67. I really didn't accomplish

06:32.568 --> 06:45.307
very much with scholarly nature, because it 
wasn't very convenient to go down to work with the

06:32.568 --> 06:45.307
group, and I was very much absorbed with the 
children. But once they were both established and

06:45.327 --> 06:47.650
in grade school, then I began commuting over to San 
Jose to teach full-time. and didn't really aspire

06:49.233 --> 06:54.478
to a full-time job. But, after I'd been doing that a 
year and a half, Gloria Klein resigned. The

07:02.587 --> 07:09.574
Western History slot there, that came open, and 
that was offered to me, and it was just too good to

07:02.587 --> 07:09.574
sell. And so there I was, unexpectedly, with a 
full-time tenure slot position, and

07:16.182 --> 07:31.866
beginning to have serious doubts at the end of the 
first year about how terrible that would be as the

07:16.182 --> 07:31.866
children got into Catalyst, even though Peter was 
marvelously cooperative and supportive. And

07:31.886 --> 07:40.620
then the whole situation resolved itself because 
we decided we wanted to get the children out of

07:31.886 --> 07:40.620
California soon. a lot of families that were 
serious about their children were bailing out of

07:41.647 --> 07:49.158
California by then. Yeah, okay. Yeah, things were 
just beginning. The funniest thing, and we were

07:51.482 --> 07:56.269
upset about the California schools. We finally, 
the last year we were there, pulled the children

07:59.770 --> 08:08.820
out of the public school and had them in a little 
ungraded, rather quirky private school that ran

07:59.770 --> 08:08.820
mostly the faculty children. And one time Peter 
drove the children away, dropped them off, came

08:08.840 --> 08:19.411
back on the ground and saw the filthy speech 
movement had started down in Berkeley. And of

08:19.431 --> 08:22.995
course things filtered up to Davis from Berkeley. 
Monkey seemed like a dude. And so the school

08:24.965 --> 08:33.855
genius, and you know the top grade level of the 
school was sixth grade, and it had been graded into

08:24.965 --> 08:33.855
one. The school genius, who was the son of one of 
Peter's colleagues, had organized a speech

08:33.875 --> 08:50.635
demonstration, and he printed up placards, they 
were marching, when Peter got there, and the

08:33.875 --> 08:50.635
leader needed five letters to spell this 
four-letter word. So

08:51.053 --> 09:00.145
I thought, well, we've looked over the brink of the 
21st century. It was so funny. But at any rate, we

09:01.767 --> 09:15.445
felt that we would have a much sounder 
environment.

09:15.806 --> 09:18.850
And so anyhow, my consolation before

09:19.538 --> 09:41.394
leaving

09:19.538 --> 09:41.394
the teaching job, which I really enjoyed, was that 
I would go to the library this year. I had had

09:41.414 --> 09:41.795
actual... Excuse me. Peter comes to Texas? He 
comes to UT. He joins the math department at UT for

09:42.796 --> 09:44.459
his tennis. I had actually had a letter from OU 
Press, from Savoy Library, sending me a reader's

09:44.479 --> 09:46.322
report. Somebody other than Max had called his 
attention to it and said it was something that

09:48.277 --> 09:57.453
should be published as a book. And Savoy sent me 
this report and told me what to do. Which was not

10:05.320 --> 10:20.083
anything I wanted to do, because that would have 
taken

10:05.320 --> 10:20.083
the book in a direction I didn't want to go. But it 
was out of the question at the time. I wasn't

10:22.487 --> 10:22.987
teaching at all. I was dealing with a very sick 
child for about a year. And I just wrote back and

10:24.109 --> 10:26.653
said, but that gave me an inkling that Yeah, I had 
something there. And I wasn't satisfied. I didn't

10:32.509 --> 10:37.895
want to publish that, because my real interest, my 
primary interest, was the Indians. And it was an

10:38.015 --> 10:44.421
analysis, really, the Spanish policy toward the 
Indians. And I wanted to do the Indian story. So

10:47.744 --> 10:55.392
anyhow, I had that permanent in the back of my mind 
when we got there, and I had some questions. As soon

10:55.692 --> 11:08.718
as I got the household resettled, I went up to the 
Berkley Library where Lorena Fran was so gracious

10:55.692 --> 11:08.718
enough and took such good care of me. She chased me 
out of the stairs one day. Did you do something like

11:10.220 --> 11:11.062
that? No, she thought I did. She thought I had put a 
piece of paper in my pocket or something, I think.

11:17.395 --> 11:18.156
Couldn't you do that? Oh, she was fiercely 
protective. And she retired when they moved up to

11:25.535 --> 11:31.083
the new building. She did not want the library 
taking away from the students, which was what

11:31.103 --> 11:36.270
she... That's a good point. That's right. Now I 
think, now knowing what I know also about the state

11:37.211 --> 11:45.662
of her health and about the design of those stacks, 
going

11:46.402 --> 12:05.926
up and down those stairs in that building. That, 
Ms. Dax, is really, you know, very, it's very

12:05.946 --> 12:08.970
dangerous. And she was quite right to attack me. 
But anyhow, I just had enormous good luck and was

12:09.751 --> 12:12.274
able to combine that, or I was riding her and other 
junior high school kids. And I had largely

12:12.710 --> 12:30.828
completed the research by the time Peter accepted 
an offer to go to the University of Kentucky. And so

12:30.848 --> 12:31.950
I actually finished the manuscript in Lexington. 
Peter had taken

12:33.432 --> 12:47.608
a year's leave here, but he retained the caution. 
He really expected to stay in Kentucky because it

12:47.928 --> 12:57.399
was his stat department. His stat departments are 
rarely entirely clinical associations. But he

13:00.302 --> 13:01.684
was not well encouraged about Kentucky. I've got 
the

13:02.423 --> 13:18.663
university situation

13:02.423 --> 13:18.663
there, and it was right there, so that skills were 
triggered. And so that became my enormous relief.

13:19.464 --> 13:20.065
The library there was nothing. Is that right? 
Isn't that something? I don't know. I don't know. I

13:22.628 --> 13:23.008
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't 
know. I don't know. It

13:26.470 --> 13:45.635
was

13:26.470 --> 13:45.635
the only time either Peter or I went away from this 
country.

13:45.655 --> 13:47.458
And I think there's always Peter, who is Welsh, and 
has been in this country since 1949. He missed the

13:47.478 --> 13:48.339
optimism of the West. And the old border states, it 
is said, really, in many ways, were hit harder by

13:49.623 --> 14:00.915
the war and the destruction in the Deep South 
because they didn't have almost the fresh start of

13:49.623 --> 14:00.915
the Deep South. I grew up with a strong obsession 
with the Civil War. I was in the little Dixie part of

14:10.549 --> 14:15.436
Oklahoma. My family, most of the people at the time 
were Syrians, but it was great back in the day. And

14:20.843 --> 14:28.894
I, meanwhile, before we packed up and came back to 
Texas, to Austin, mailed a

14:36.367 --> 14:53.805
And I

14:36.367 --> 14:53.805
know now that they were kind

14:36.367 --> 14:53.805
of stunned by the

14:36.367 --> 14:53.805
size of it. But Frank did send it out to me. And I got

14:58.250 --> 15:02.734
one strongly favorable report, one quite 
negative. Uh-huh. But Frank liked it. And then he

15:05.797 --> 15:13.984
sent it back to me saying, this is a fine piece of 
work. It should be published. But it is too long. It

15:15.146 --> 15:21.091
calls for some

15:15.146 --> 15:21.091
time. It must be addressed. And so I did. And what 
was ultimately published is still probably an

15:22.432 --> 15:25.975
unbecoming long book. It's about

15:25.995 --> 15:30.239
75% of the original. When I got it whittled down and 
resubmitted it, His response then was that he

15:35.902 --> 15:49.681
really wanted to

15:35.902 --> 15:49.681
publish it. He thought it should be published, but 
he couldn't do it at that time because he didn't

15:49.801 --> 15:54.568
have the money in hand to do it. He had, and he 
explained to me how the presses were doing this

15:54.588 --> 16:03.580
work, that he had to wait until he got enough money 
back from other publications then in the market to

15:54.588 --> 16:03.580
put together enough money Okay, good. He was using 
those revolving funds, and that's when his trick

16:05.633 --> 16:11.960
betrayed him. Well, apparently it was, yeah, I was 
not, he didn't have an advocate. And that's

16:18.128 --> 16:21.352
something he tried to regret. The bottom had 
collapsed in the markets. The average was

16:23.554 --> 16:26.397
crossing forward about that time. That's true. I 
hadn't even made that connection. And he may have.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.242
He made a lot of references to that. I thought you 
meant Wall Street. Well, that, of course, the oil

16:37.692 --> 16:40.496
had gone up. But yes, everything else had gone 
down. Stock market had gone down. I had forgotten

16:45.343 --> 16:46.604
that. But at any rate, he said, I know that this is 
important to you. And if you want to seek another

16:56.598 --> 17:07.270
publisher, since I cannot give you a firm horizon 
for this, I will encourage you to go ahead and do

16:56.598 --> 17:07.270
that. And so I actually made a couple of other 
staffs at it, unsuccessfully, most amusing. I

17:14.078 --> 17:24.951
actually thought maybe it would be better, 
because I knew of some of the trials and

17:14.078 --> 17:24.951
tribulations over at the Hanson faculty 
committee. I thought maybe it would be smarter

17:25.792 --> 17:36.444
to go with commercial press. And I submitted it to 
Hardcourt Grace.

17:44.353 --> 17:49.199
And either the president or the vice president, 
somebody wrote me the devices explaining why they

17:44.353 --> 17:49.199
put him in the same group. He was just so smart. But 
that D Brown had essentially wiped out the Indian

17:52.454 --> 17:59.989
market for Indian things with very my heart at the 
beginning. He had swamped that market with that

18:00.009 --> 18:13.416
enormous success and that nobody, no other 
commercial publisher would be publishing a major

18:00.009 --> 18:13.416
thing for years to come in Indian history. I 
thought that was . But anyhow.

18:23.862 --> 18:27.849
Well, obviously, it was a bad judgment, because 
Indian literature was popular. The popularity

18:27.969 --> 18:36.101
was just, and I think it was indeed stimulated by a 
very . And so. And I remember I sent it to Alvin

18:40.936 --> 18:46.482
Giuseppe, or I sent him a letter of inquiry to Alvin 
Giuseppe. And he wrote back and said if he would

18:47.463 --> 18:55.331
like to bring us to do it. But I don't think he ever 
used to do things like that. And he's been a hard

18:57.353 --> 18:58.794
worker. He wrote a general book like Indians of the 
West or something like that. But no. She wanted

19:07.724 --> 19:08.985
bunnies. on

19:09.337 --> 19:18.646
New Year's Day. What was

19:18.666 --> 19:33.300
New Year's Day? It must have been September 4th. 
There was a story in paper that Frank Ward wanted us

19:33.981 --> 19:35.742
to go down to to start an increase. And we were just 
listening. And we're sitting at the breakfast

19:36.323 --> 19:37.504
table reading the paper. And he was saying that he 
was going down to A&M to start a new press, and he

19:38.648 --> 19:56.569
wanted... Did you think that was New Year's, you 
think, 74? I think it was. Okay, good. That's good.

20:00.393 --> 20:02.275
Uh, does that jive with the nation? Yeah, 
everything, yeah, that's good. Okay. And the only

20:03.877 --> 20:09.387
numbers I code with well are dates. Peter doesn't 
trust me on any others. He is very good on all

20:12.312 --> 20:15.377
numbers except dates. I'm not good at names, 
dates, and places. How have I ever gotten to do this

20:17.621 --> 20:20.627
story and I have never figured it out? I'm losing 
names now at a rate that terrifies me. It's so

20:25.776 --> 20:26.998
embarrassing. But at any rate,

20:26.978 --> 20:47.699
he said that he wanted Storms to be

20:26.978 --> 20:47.699
his first book and that he would promise me first 
class production, which he certainly did very

20:26.978 --> 20:47.699
well. It was beautiful. And so of course I was 
thrilled. And I said, let me think about it. And I

20:51.423 --> 20:51.923
consulted with him. And she said if she

20:53.152 --> 21:11.929
had a book

20:53.152 --> 21:11.929
ready to go, she would come back to do it. Because 
they are very different. But I knew she wouldn't

21:16.233 --> 21:19.956
get the bonus to do it. And, you know, one of her 
various sides caused her to go. And so, anyhow, I

21:21.137 --> 21:21.758
really agree. And he

21:22.447 --> 21:43.087
then began

21:22.447 --> 21:43.087
on his own time, while he was still

21:22.447 --> 21:43.087
at UT Press, he also hired some freelance people on 
the side. And I had forgotten the name of the woman,

21:43.107 --> 21:44.590
because he wanted to get money. The

21:44.941 --> 21:58.462
name of the woman who he hired on a freelance basis, 
she was at UT Press, but then she moonlighted. No,

21:58.482 --> 22:00.445
no, no. No, it was a woman named Elizabeth. A 
blonde, a thin blonde woman. Probably

22:04.331 --> 22:04.772
disagreeable. I learned from Lorena that 
everybody was horrified that Frank wanted to take

22:04.972 --> 22:20.382
her down as editor down there and everybody was 
horrified that she had been infuriating authors.

22:20.362 --> 22:28.555
And I certainly disliked her, but I kept feeling 
the pain. She refused to go to A&M. She didn't want

22:30.638 --> 22:34.844
to be part of the Poly Station life, which was far 
from glamorous in those days. And she had a job

22:35.325 --> 22:39.952
lined up in Tokyo, Tokyo University Press. And so 
Margaret was not on board yet. Yeah. Yes, she had

22:48.037 --> 22:53.763
been a student in England. She had at one time, I 
think, worked for Franken.

23:00.190 --> 23:01.111
Yes, she had. Then she left for Greenland and went 
to the firm. And I've got all that somewhere in my

23:06.736 --> 23:13.604
hand.

23:14.625 --> 23:16.947
Anyhow, he brought her back. And I think she 
arrived in the fall of 74. She was on the head in

23:26.444 --> 23:30.571
September for the press, yeah. Okay, certainly, 
maybe it was just her and Frank in the end. Well,

23:34.458 --> 23:36.602
basically, that's it. Because she and Frank and 
then Gayle. Gayle, okay. Frank hired Gayle out of

23:41.371 --> 23:47.782
the extension office. Thank you. And Frank was

23:49.748 --> 24:02.467
ill a bunch of times. So Margaret

24:02.868 --> 24:13.103
carried a tremendous load. Yes. She really did. 
Gaila in the beginning, although she later became

24:16.789 --> 24:22.257
very good, Gaila in the beginning was funny. She 
was in a world that she knew not of. Sure, that's

24:24.520 --> 24:25.481
right. She was tremendously conscientious, and 
so she learned. But Margaret is sharp as a whip. I

24:32.712 --> 24:42.871
very much

24:32.712 --> 24:42.871
regret

24:32.712 --> 24:42.871
that I just never get to see Margaret. She is, of 
course, so terribly busy with that job she has.

24:46.158 --> 24:48.041
It's a killer job. But she was just superb, and I 
really loved working with her. But the first copy

24:56.017 --> 25:03.384
editing run-through was done by this person. I'm 
going to find that . And then for book design,

25:06.747 --> 25:22.062
Frank, actually, when he talked to me in the very 
beginning about his plans, and he wanted this to be

25:06.747 --> 25:22.062
a beautiful book. And I said, I'm sure it will be, 
because I remember the blockbuster that your

25:25.328 --> 25:29.135
first book of your team was from. I was a grad 
student. Who was that? That was the Florida of the

25:30.918 --> 25:34.685
Inca, Donna Jeanette Barnard. And that came out 
while I was a grad student. And boy, did that set

25:38.231 --> 25:42.679
people on their ear enormously. I don't think that 
Samoie Lawtonville saw that as good news at all.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.266
Boy, there was a formidable rivalry. And, of 
course, Oklahoma had never done anything that

25:51.367 --> 25:55.915
spectacular. But Frank had this tremendous feel 
for the arts. But he said that he had wonderful

25:58.800 --> 26:02.727
design. who

26:02.707 --> 26:21.330
would be able

26:02.707 --> 26:21.330
to do such a lovely job in this book.

26:21.350 --> 26:23.933
She would know just the right people and the right 
team to use at the beginning of her life. Jo Alice

26:23.953 --> 26:25.035
Downs, who had retired on disability. She had a 
great career. She had mental health problems. And

26:26.556 --> 26:31.903
she just was not up to the stress of working. I 
remember

26:33.065 --> 26:46.243
mentioning this to a friend who was at one time at 
the press, and he snapped, and he's usually the

26:33.065 --> 26:46.243
kindest of men. I always thought she caused more 
grief than she suffered, but I found her very nice.

26:53.053 --> 26:58.881
And she then, he hired her to do that. And she was 
able. And

27:00.149 --> 27:13.376
then this, this I think you will not wish to comment 
on. She told Frank she didn't do anything. because

27:15.877 --> 27:39.414
the authorities

27:15.877 --> 27:39.414
were watching her so

27:15.877 --> 27:39.414
closely that they construed her being able to make 
a little bit of money as evidence that she was not

27:15.877 --> 27:39.414
entitled to Social Security retirement. And so, 
she did it, and did it beautifully. But of course,

27:40.535 --> 27:40.956
she... She was devoted to Frank, and he to her, and 
she would have done it as a labor of love. But it was

27:50.992 --> 27:56.240
expected in the beginning, and Frank expected

27:50.992 --> 27:56.240
it. He paid her properly for it. But she did a 
beautiful job. And then he also, in that... That

28:08.037 --> 28:23.856
little article I was just reading,

28:08.037 --> 28:23.856
he was talking about scarcity

28:08.037 --> 28:23.856
and cost of payments. He had managed to find, 
somewhere, as set aside, a stash of pocket money.

28:29.123 --> 28:31.826
So he was really taking, he took the physical book 
so seriously. He bought, he literally, and I can't

28:31.846 --> 28:36.492
remember that, I used to know this, he literally 
took cash, one of his pocket money, and bought it.

28:37.163 --> 28:39.167
$170,000 worth of paper. Phenomenal. Paper. Raw 
paper. He wanted paper. He thought paper was

28:43.053 --> 28:44.095
scary. It was hard to get. It was expensive. It was 
going to go up. And he lived on that paper. He

28:48.663 --> 28:51.308
impressed him for some time. Now, no one would ever 
do that again, I'm sure. And it's only these little

29:00.079 --> 29:09.172
art presses now, or these little hobby presses 
that go for that kind of quality. Yeah, that's

29:09.192 --> 29:11.275
right. So I still remember this thing. My book was

29:13.158 --> 29:33.346
created by a publishing company, and he and I, and 
Buck, and that's at Centennial, we had two

29:13.158 --> 29:33.346
volumes, and he and I, and Buck

29:13.158 --> 29:33.346
Weir was in it, and I still remember it. Yeah. I 
don't know about you, but everything's true. But

29:34.387 --> 29:38.752
he was anticipating that in this article. He was 
glad. He was an artist. You said what? Wyrus. Mike

29:45.981 --> 29:46.842
Shewitz. Oh, yeah. Wyrus is the director of the 
Portland Students Association. And a big

29:52.108 --> 29:53.910
supporter. The Aggies really, really know him. 
Oh, yes, I know. He was most grateful. It was a

30:00.993 --> 30:03.015
remarkable time. Let me ask you about Texas. What 
about Texas? The U.T. graphs? The U.T. graphs and

30:11.547 --> 30:12.729
why I find left. And I think of a lot of them. My 
understanding is, and these are the first towns

30:14.952 --> 30:23.023
involved, that there was a peak. So

30:24.320 --> 30:39.172
he dismissed his class early and he went to sleep.

30:40.655 --> 30:43.341
Anyhow, there was and

30:45.211 --> 30:54.504
individually established, even by university 
standards, on the campus. And they have managed to

30:54.524 --> 30:55.367
get him a saddle. One of them, remember, was the 
dean of the graduate school. and I guess the vice

30:57.513 --> 31:02.138
president.

31:04.601 --> 31:25.765
No, no, no, no,

31:04.601 --> 31:25.765
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

31:04.601 --> 31:25.765
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

31:04.601 --> 31:25.765
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

31:04.601 --> 31:25.765
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
no, no, no, no, no, no, no They were sneering at

31:26.048 --> 31:31.638
U.T. Press as the couch hit the desk. Because Frank 
was aware. Oh, yeah. They told it to him to his face.

31:43.881 --> 31:49.812
And he was told that when it was published he was
