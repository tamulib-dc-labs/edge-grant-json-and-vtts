00:01.482 --> 00:06.306
In 1932, this Sims Street was the Hearn Highway. 
No, wait a minute. Yes. No? Hearn Highway went up on

00:13.593 --> 00:16.696
Washington. This was Table Road. And it was 
gravel. And this place here where this house is

00:22.321 --> 00:26.705
sitting in, it was a cotton field. They raised 
cotton and corn here. And when I bought this land

00:29.832 --> 00:37.239
here, it was still rose, oh, say, four or five 
inches high yet. That's straight in the mile

00:38.120 --> 00:41.423
because the rose was standing here. And the wire 
fence rolled up the wire and cleaned up, cleaned up

00:41.443 --> 00:49.111
the bar ditch. There's lots of work here. Do you 
know who owned this land? Yes. Well, I bought it. I

00:54.877 --> 00:59.181
don't know who owned it then at the time of when they 
when the field was in progress. But I bought it from

01:03.781 --> 01:10.131
this

01:03.781 --> 01:10.131
real estate broker. He was a lawyer. He's dead now.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.045
Well, I can't think of his name right now. But he was 
a lawyer. And his partner, who was a part-time

01:20.847 --> 01:27.598
owner of the lumber company in that other end of 
town and i bought that from them and later on i

01:29.182 --> 01:59.121
bought that other lot i had uh work uh this land here 
the way that uh build it up but it was kind of low you

01:29.182 --> 01:59.121
know and then later on they they blocked up that 
street it didn't stay uh too long trucks broke the

01:59.827 --> 02:01.269
like Ash Falls and all that. Then, about six, seven 
years ago, they put that concrete on there because

02:01.890 --> 02:09.242
that made it real fine. But the city limits, when I 
came here in Briner, was 10,000 in the city. And the

02:15.311 --> 02:22.363
city limit was there at the corner of Sims and 15th 
Street. That was the city limits then. Well, back

02:24.806 --> 02:25.868
in In 19, let me see, it was,

02:27.080 --> 02:39.551
I don't know, maybe 39, 40 city limits were up to the 
railroad track. Now the city limits are kind of

02:39.571 --> 02:44.676
close to Benchley.

02:46.017 --> 02:56.226
And it has grown considerably because between

02:46.017 --> 02:56.226
here and college, It was a partner with Woods 
there. Well, it was one or two houses, maybe three.

03:05.029 --> 03:09.195
And it rebuilt the streets, College Avenue. It was 
this Texas. Texas Avenue used to be College

03:11.758 --> 03:16.044
Avenue. And it run through college. That was 
Highway 61 through Houston. And then this other,

03:20.830 --> 03:25.757
now that where it cuts off and College Avenue going 
to that Highway 6 now, it wasn't only a small street

03:26.260 --> 03:35.390
there. I remember we had a little trail there to go 
through there, a short cut. But we had College

03:41.737 --> 03:46.943
Avenue come around like that and make it in here. 
And then they straightened up like that and went

03:47.684 --> 03:49.246
on. But the year I left here in 1934,

03:56.517 --> 03:57.358
Went to Houston. And in those years, that's when 
all this happened. Then I hit Huntsville, and I

04:01.723 --> 04:07.891
went to work for Chevrolet in Huntsville. And, 
well, I used to come here every now and then, see my

04:08.832 --> 04:12.616
father and my mother. I'd come at nighttime and go 
back at night. So I wasn't aware of what was going

04:15.560 --> 04:18.083
on. But then when I moved to Bryan and back with my 
family in 42,

04:26.943 --> 04:30.827
Well, then I noticed that Brian has grown quite a 
lot. And they built this Brian Field, and there's a

04:31.747 --> 04:36.131
lot going on. And since then, it has grown so much 
that I'll have to, sometimes I get called to go

04:37.713 --> 04:46.321
start a car somewhere. I'll have to find it in the 
mail before I go. It's getting where, well, I know

04:50.424 --> 04:56.730
Brian pretty good, but now and then, I'll have to. I 
have to look in the map to find the places and where

04:57.166 --> 05:04.105
they are and all that.
