WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:08.149
Let's talk about the effect of the Korean War, or 
about the Korean War itself.

00:11.852 --> 00:13.514
Why weren't you called into the Korean War? I was. 
But I didn't go. Then why isn't it here? You were

00:20.360 --> 00:22.262
called, but you didn't go? I got orders. Oh, tell me 
about that. I'm full of these little strange

00:27.586 --> 00:31.590
things. That's just after the time that I had 
joined the 420th Engineer Brigade. Yeah, right. I

00:39.437 --> 00:42.901
had joined the 420th Engineer Brigade shortly. 
1951, yeah. Okay, and it seemed to me like it was

00:45.704 --> 00:53.053
like in May or June, somewhere in the middle of the 
summer. The war broke out in June 1950. Yeah, but

00:54.875 --> 01:00.081
I'm... Korean War? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Well, anyhow, 
I joined the 420th in, like, May or June of 51. Yeah.

01:09.880 --> 01:20.511
And in November, I got orders to report to Fort 
Belvoir, which was a Korean call. Okay. I knew that

01:23.715 --> 01:29.601
I was not supposed to be called as an individual out 
of an organized reserve unit. That was policy

01:30.082 --> 01:31.463
then. They did not call individuals out of reserve 
units for active duty. I knew it was a mistake. But

01:41.944 --> 01:46.992
anyhow, I had this order to report to Fort Belvoir. 
So I went on and went to Fort Hood and took my

01:48.494 --> 01:52.540
physical. But in the meantime, I had applied to 
Texas Military District to clarify my status. but

02:02.628 --> 02:04.872
I wasn't really ready to go back on active duty. But 
anyhow, the upshot of the whole thing was that when

02:06.855 --> 02:23.162
the Adjutant General in Washington asked for 
clarification on my status for recall, they

02:06.855 --> 02:23.162
overlooked the order that I had been assigned to 
the 420th Engineer Brigade. I see. So I wasn't

02:24.104 --> 02:27.910
available for recall, and the order was revoked. 
But I went so far as to take my physical to go to Fort

02:28.666 --> 02:35.614
Belvoir. So when I got that resolved, well, that 
took me completely out of the Korean War. I see. In

02:43.382 --> 02:47.687
other words, if you would have not been assigned to 
the 420, I think you would have... I would have been

02:47.707 --> 02:48.968
in the Korean War. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, what were 
your feelings about that, about not going? I

02:54.114 --> 02:57.357
didn't want to get back in... in that skirmish over 
there I really I really didn't want to go back on

02:58.163 --> 03:27.495
active duty but first I was fulfilling my duty in a 
reserve status and this was the time you know this

02:58.163 --> 03:27.495
was this is the way you could fulfill your duty now 
if the 420th had been called I had no compunction I

02:58.163 --> 03:27.495
mean that that was my unit yeah but uh as an 
individual I I didn't want to there's a you know you

02:58.163 --> 03:27.495
just get kicked into a strange unit in combat or 
wherever, you're sort of lost. Yeah. But the 420th

03:35.645 --> 03:39.529
been called, I had not a word to say. Well, what were 
your feelings? There were very few reserve units

03:40.750 --> 03:44.434
called during the Korean War. What was your 
feeling toward that? Did you think that Truman

03:46.076 --> 03:53.905
should call up the reserves or should use draft or 
should draft young men or what? Well, I was on a

03:55.336 --> 04:01.822
panel up at the War College to discuss that 
particular feature. Really? When was this? In the

04:05.105 --> 04:06.086
1960s? No, this is when I went to the War College 
here at,

04:06.486 --> 04:14.774
up here, right here, 1969. 1969. Yeah. They had a 
panel of reservists, and that question was posed

04:17.896 --> 04:24.162
to the reservists as whether the whether the 
morale of the reserves would have been enhanced or

04:25.660 --> 04:39.287
whatever from calling reserve units to Korean War 
or whether we thought we should not have been

04:25.660 --> 04:39.287
called or whatever. The consensus of that panel 
was that it was a mistake not to use the reserves for

04:40.329 --> 04:47.483
what they were intended for. Not that anybody 
wanted to go to combat. Not that anybody wanted to

04:51.731 --> 04:53.253
get in the war. But they were paid for that. Tax 
monies were used for that. And it was the consensus

04:59.619 --> 05:08.708
of that group that the reserve program feels that 
when a need is there, they ought to be used. Yeah.

05:10.470 --> 05:18.057
And most of these then were other, at this 
conference, were other reserve generals? That's

05:18.258 --> 05:18.718
right. That's correct. In fact, it was a school, it 
was a two-week conference for general officers.

05:26.362 --> 05:31.248
So this panel was made up of reserve and National 
Guard generals. And it was just about unanimous

05:33.051 --> 05:43.745
opinion that they thought a mistake was made in not 
utilizing reserves for what they were intended

05:33.051 --> 05:43.745
for. And did you think the same with the Vietnam 
War? Well, by that time, I had a little different

05:50.542 --> 06:03.721
opinion of the Vietnam War because... Because 
this was right during the heat of the Vietnam War in

05:50.542 --> 06:03.721
1969. Well, that's right. And Johnson refused to 
call up the reserves. That's right.

06:11.533 --> 06:18.523
The Vietnam War and the Korean War were similar, 
but I think we got into the Vietnam War a little bit

06:18.773 --> 06:22.277
differently than we got in the Korean War. And for 
that reason, I felt a little bit different about

06:22.978 --> 06:27.243
the Korean War. I mean, yeah, the Vietnam War. But 
the principle that we talked about, I think, still

06:30.387 --> 06:34.452
held. I think when troops are needed, then they 
ought to turn to the reserve. Because that's what

06:41.660 --> 06:43.843
the reserve is for. And I just think that And any 
time we have any kind of emergency, I just think

06:48.777 --> 07:01.113
Johnson was just completely off base and not using 
the reserves more than they were used. And I think

07:01.193 --> 07:04.438
his was strictly political. He was strictly 
political. And I don't think that kind of decision

07:07.402 --> 07:11.427
needs to be made on a political basis. Well, 
speaking of political and military decisions,

07:12.588 --> 07:21.381
let's talk about your views on getting back to 
Korea, back on the Korean War. What did you think of

07:21.421 --> 07:23.665
the idea of a stalemate war? I don't think we ought 
to ever get into one. We don't go in to win.

07:31.977 --> 07:38.427
What did you think about the political decision to 
fire General MacArthur? and not to strike the

07:38.778 --> 07:52.016
bases, the Chinese bases north of the Yalu River, 
and to continue a divided Korea? Well, I think that

07:53.558 --> 08:04.953
MacArthur knew more about what we ought to do over 
there than some of the politicians in Washington.

08:05.274 --> 08:08.498
And I personally think that It's difficult to kill 
an ant bed by catching them every time they come out

08:08.765 --> 08:15.513
around the hole. I think you need to get in the hole 
to get them. But I think MacArthur was wrong in

08:19.498 --> 08:28.148
being insubordinate to his spirit, even though he 
knew a heck of a lot more than his spirit did.

08:32.473 --> 08:38.400
That situation has just grated on me ever since it 
happened. And I'm terribly surprised that a man of

08:39.595 --> 08:48.003
his military career would get into the situation 
that he got into. Now, I think there are a lot of

08:48.923 --> 08:52.366
things behind it. He was being sniped at by a lot of 
people that didn't like him, who had an ear to the

08:54.188 --> 09:01.595
president. I think that's without question. But 
our military structure has always been built on

09:08.435 --> 09:18.767
absolute devotion to duty, absolute 
subordination to superiors. And I cannot, by any

09:19.869 --> 09:33.145
means, support MacArthur or anybody else taking 
the action that they did, from what I can read. I

09:33.785 --> 09:36.028
don't know what was going on. I can see the reports. 
But just a general idea. That's right. But I think

09:40.313 --> 09:44.657
we ought to gone ask those boogers and got them out 
of there. There was no way to win like we went. And I

09:50.142 --> 09:54.565
totally agree with MacArthur that there's no 
substitution for victory in war. You don't go into

09:55.486 --> 09:59.069
war to push somebody back. You go into war to win the 
dadgum thing. If you're going to get in the war, you

10:02.332 --> 10:05.695
ought to go to win it. okay then let's let's relate 
that to vietnam is that the way you felt about

10:06.569 --> 10:34.990
vietnam that's right i don't think we ought to have 
been there like we were that they let to my way of

10:06.569 --> 10:34.990
thinking and again what i can read we went over 
there to advise them whether that's really what we

10:06.569 --> 10:34.990
went for or not i don't know but that's the role we 
went with and then we had people there and we just

10:06.569 --> 10:34.990
got involved in the darn thing but Here again, I 
don't have any

10:35.257 --> 10:45.326
feeling that we ought to have gone there without 
trying to win it. Now, do you blame losing that war

10:45.346 --> 10:51.692
on politicians or on the military? I don't know 
which politicians.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.177
And here again, rightfully so. I think our top...

11:03.877 --> 11:06.541
Decision makers ought to be the civilians. I like 
our system. But I think our military people did a

11:10.567 --> 11:19.801
great job, but they had their hands tied behind 
them. And I don't think we ought to go in any war

11:19.821 --> 11:26.791
without swinging with both hands. I don't think 
you can blame that on the military at all. At least I

11:32.279 --> 11:33.681
don't.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.545
Who do you think holds the power in America, then? 
Who holds it? Do you think it's the people or do you

11:41.188 --> 11:43.711
think it's the elites?

11:46.755 --> 11:59.331
Well, it's the bigwigs in Washington and not 
necessarily the elected bigwigs.

12:01.167 --> 12:07.472
people that are ingrained up there that are 
running that place, and I don't think it's all

12:01.167 --> 12:07.472
congressional people. What do you mean? Who is it 
then? Oh, it's the

12:11.436 --> 12:25.147
appointed people that are in the civil service 
jobs and the high echelons of appointed jobs. Of

12:26.789 --> 12:30.972
course, see, they're not They're not subject to 
the whims of people at all. The big high civil

12:35.836 --> 12:40.945
service people and this sort of thing. We've got 
too much of that, in my opinion. You can't touch

12:43.829 --> 12:45.372
them.

12:48.096 --> 12:50.620
Let's go back to your career. In the 1960s, all of a 
sudden, You get all kinds of service schools. I

12:59.989 --> 13:01.811
noticed you didn't have very much. Oh, from 44, you 
have one. And then you don't have another one until

13:04.274 --> 13:07.797
1962. But then from 62 to 69, it's just one right 
after another. Well, two things. One, I

13:14.624 --> 13:24.955
began to get in a more responsible job in the 
military and in the highway department. I had more

13:25.036 --> 13:41.830
latitude to go to those schools and I had more 
desire to go because each one of them was enhancing

13:25.036 --> 13:41.830
my education and my command abilities and there 
were lots of opportunities to go. There was uh

13:42.892 --> 13:45.998
that's during the time they were promoting the 
reserves, and as I said a while ago, lots of

13:46.214 --> 13:53.043
schools, lots of armories, lots of emphasis on the 
reserve. And there was just lots of schools that

13:54.104 --> 13:59.431
were available to me, and I took the opportunity to 
go. It not only entailed travel over the United

13:59.531 --> 14:12.287
States, but met and associated with many, many 
people that I got as much out of as I did out of

13:59.531 --> 14:12.287
school. Right. Right. What do you think were the 
most important schools? I noticed you have

14:16.763 --> 14:20.527
chemical and biological weapons. There were a few 
of those schools that I was sort of expected to go

14:22.288 --> 14:26.012
to. That chemical and biological out at Dugway was 
one of them. About that time, the nerve gases and

14:32.858 --> 14:41.365
the various

14:32.858 --> 14:41.365
exotic... warfare techniques were coming into 
prominence. They wanted us to know about them.

14:49.210 --> 14:58.804
Another one is the police school over at, I

14:49.210 --> 14:58.804
forgot what place it was now. You mean the 
disturbance orientation course? Yeah. I was

15:01.487 --> 15:04.331
going to ask you about that at Fort Gordon, 
Georgia. Right. Yeah. That was during the times of

15:06.294 --> 15:09.799
strikes and violence. That was a response, would 
you say that was a response to the civil

15:10.066 --> 15:17.273
disturbances of the mid-1960s? That's correct. 
They were trying to educate the reserves to

15:19.535 --> 15:26.482
fulfill their role in case they were needed. And 
those schools were pretty much mandatory.

15:30.466 --> 15:32.808
Mandatory for the leaders in the Army? Right, 
that's correct. And they were established for

15:34.910 --> 15:37.272
that purpose, for They are established by the 
politicians or by the military? By the military to

15:42.179 --> 15:49.025
deal with their role in foiling riots and handling 
disturbances and this sort of thing. Well, tell me

15:49.045 --> 15:49.886
about that. What did they teach you? Oh, they 
taught you riot control. They taught you the

15:54.751 --> 16:01.237
various chemicals that were available for riot 
control. They taught you... many things where you

16:05.230 --> 16:22.968
need to use restraints,

16:05.230 --> 16:22.968
what to do in case of violence, what to do if people 
had to be restrained and kept pinned up, so to

16:05.230 --> 16:22.968
speak. And they just ran the gamut as far as those 
things that you would do as a leader. to direct your

16:31.471 --> 16:33.113
troops. Did they bring in military officers, or 
did they bring in police who had been in these

16:33.673 --> 16:38.898
riots? Both. Both. A lot of our instructors were 
police who had been actually involved. As I

16:49.048 --> 16:56.055
remember, one of our instructors was the police 
commissioner of New York City. Yeah, he'd been

16:56.075 --> 16:57.456
involved. Golly, you couldn't have found a person 
who had more. actual experience, but they brought

17:01.002 --> 17:18.881
in people that had actually been involved and told 
you of things that had happened to them and how they

17:01.002 --> 17:18.881
had handled them and policies and techniques and 
procedures, and it was most interesting. Sounds

17:18.901 --> 17:20.703
like that would be fascinating. What type of 
people were these? I mean, the teachers, were

17:22.365 --> 17:28.331
they, what could you describe them? Is there any 
way that you could categorize all of these people?

17:31.647 --> 17:32.768
Besides experienced? No. There were some 
military. There were some military instructors

17:37.793 --> 17:45.020
and then some of the, I'd say, outside PAC people. 
But they were, I would call them professionals. I

17:48.063 --> 17:49.064
can sure tell you that. Because the Army went out 
and got the best that they could find. They did not

17:54.850 --> 17:59.494
spare expense. And there were not only military 
people in the school, there were outsiders, like

18:00.605 --> 18:09.874
police chiefs and police commissioners. I mean, 
there were students in the school, too, along with

18:10.054 --> 18:13.678
military. Oh, students. Yes, along with 
military. So community governments or city

18:17.141 --> 18:21.866
governments would join up there with the 
military. That's correct. That seems to be a much

18:23.268 --> 18:25.450
better idea. Oh, it was. I thought it was great. The 
concept of it was terrific. I'll tell you what it

18:30.473 --> 18:39.627
made you wish that you never got involved in one of 
those civil commotions because they can be most

18:30.473 --> 18:39.627
frustrating. Yeah. And the main reason is you're 
pitting the man that lives here against the man

18:41.329 --> 18:48.099
that lives right over there. Yeah. If you've got a 
reservist here and the man across the street is in a

18:50.183 --> 18:57.814
civil commotion, this fellow has got in some cases 
got to kill him hopefully not but here you're

18:58.368 --> 19:27.885
pitting neighbors against neighbors and that 
takes some trying now these this is 1969 these were

18:58.368 --> 19:27.885
rather angry years did the instructors use much 
rhetoric oh yeah they you know they they leveled

18:58.368 --> 19:27.885
with you I mean they they didn't pull any punches In 
fact, you got the feeling they were trying to scare

19:28.102 --> 19:33.267
you to death. Really? About what? Scare you about 
what? Well, the situations you could get in. Oh, I

19:38.773 --> 19:39.193
see. And the importance of coolness and the 
importance of using proper techniques and the

19:39.674 --> 19:54.649
importance of not prolonging or provoking these 
situations. You know, that's one of the most

19:55.152 --> 20:14.375
important things in these deals is to do the thing 
that you need to do to tend to cool it, but do it in a

19:55.152 --> 20:14.375
manner that you don't provoke and prolong and make 
it bigger and worse. And it doesn't take much in a

20:15.116 --> 20:22.024
fit of fury, you know, to just blow the thing wide 
open. Sure, sure. So they used... Well, they were,

20:25.088 --> 20:33.155
they just didn't miss any opportunities, I tell 
you for sure. Okay, let's go back to your military

20:33.175 --> 20:36.979
career that night. You know, in every career, 
highway department, teaching, or military

20:36.999 --> 20:54.235
career, people feel that they had 
accomplishments, and they also feel that there

20:36.999 --> 20:54.235
were some things that they would have liked to 
accomplish, but they just didn't have the time or

20:36.999 --> 20:54.235
something, that there were some shortcomings. 
What would you consider were the accomplishments

20:54.738 --> 21:03.049
of your military career, especially in the 
reserves over the last 10 or 20 years? The one big

21:05.091 --> 21:11.319
thing that I look back with is a great deal of 
satisfaction in the reserve.

21:14.003 --> 21:21.893
At the time I was appointed brigade commander, we 
had grown to where we were a unit to be reckoned

21:22.852 --> 21:24.435
with. We were a significant part of the reserve 
program.

21:31.466 --> 21:35.392
Up till that time, we had been growing and we had 
been getting a little bigger. We started out with a

21:35.412 --> 21:41.622
little force of two, three hundred people. We 
would work hard all during the year to aim at a

21:41.642 --> 21:49.855
couple of weeks at summer camp. We'd get on a bus and 
go to summer camp, and we'd listen to instruction,

21:50.510 --> 21:57.819
or we'd watch demonstrations. And then as we got a 
little bit more capable, we'd get on equipment,

21:58.740 --> 22:09.674
and we'd get our hands dirty, so to speak. Up until 
the time that I took over the brigade and went as a

22:12.278 --> 22:18.205
whole to a summer camp, And we'd have to try to find 
enough stuff for 400, 600, 1500 people to do

22:19.417 --> 22:32.657
constructively at one location. And we went to 
Walters Air Force Base four times. We went to Fort

22:37.704 --> 22:38.886
Hood once. And we'd gone to Fort Polk about 10 or 11 
times. We were just bulging them out at the seams.

22:49.581 --> 23:03.197
We'd come in there with 1,500, 1,600 people and 
have a real hard time finding work enough to keep

22:49.581 --> 23:03.197
all that many people busy for two weeks and then 
just pass out of the camp. So the first year that I

23:03.217 --> 23:07.742
took over the brigade, we went back to Fort Polk. 
And I, along with some of my staff officers, got to

23:09.424 --> 23:16.812
looking at, are we doing all we can do to to promote 
this unit and make it proficient and still do

23:17.180 --> 23:27.456
something constructive for the Army 
installations.

23:27.476 --> 23:32.644
And I decided that we had outgrown a camp. We had 
outgrown all going together. It was ideal because

23:36.891 --> 23:40.196
you could see every one of your troops. You could 
see all that they were doing. You could have a

23:42.620 --> 23:43.902
parade. You could have a party, you know. So I 
journeyed down to Fourth Army along with my

23:47.251 --> 23:54.179
training officer and executive officer. And we 
sat down with their training people and told them

23:54.199 --> 24:04.050
of our concept that we had outgrown a one-unit 
summer camp. And we proposed to them that we

24:06.113 --> 24:16.785
diversify ourselves and go anywhere in the Fourth 
Army that they could accommodate us at different

24:17.373 --> 24:44.224
times and split this brigade up for summer camp and 
let the staff officers of the brigade go and

24:17.373 --> 24:44.224
satellite on these units and watch them operate, 
supervise them, reconnoiter them, but operate

24:17.373 --> 24:44.224
like we'd do if we were a brigade on active duty with 
maybe a battalion over here and a separate company

24:45.200 --> 24:54.969
off over here and a group up yonder and, you know, 
just go here, there, and yonder where we could

24:45.200 --> 24:54.969
really get some good work. And boy, they threw up a 
hand and said, you can't do any such thing like

24:54.989 --> 24:58.993
that. He said, you know, you've got to go where you 
can look at your troops. And I said, look, we've got

25:02.916 --> 25:13.806
capable staff officers that can go out and be the 
listen and watch these units work. And I said, that

25:14.393 --> 25:34.621
way for 12 months, we'll not sit in that armory over 
there, but I'll send a couple of engineers to Fort

25:14.393 --> 25:34.621
Bliss, and we'll get with a post engineer, and 
we'll come up with things that this company can do

25:14.393 --> 25:34.621
and that battalion can do and this one can do, and 
we'll do the field work. We'll do the engineering

25:35.201 --> 25:36.583
work. We'll do the plan work. And then when we get 
ready to send them out there, all you've got to do is

25:38.406 --> 25:42.932
furnish some money or to buy the materials, and if 
we need to ship equipment, whatever. But we'll

25:48.618 --> 25:51.102
send a contingent out there. Then we'll send 
another one up to Fort Bliss, and another one to

25:52.063 --> 26:00.476
Chaffee, and another one to Polk, and, you know, 
wherever, and the whole Fourth Army. And they

26:01.157 --> 26:03.480
thought that we had lost our minds. They said, you 
can't control it. You can't, you can't, the thing

26:06.044 --> 26:13.155
will just completely get away from you. And we 
convinced them we could. And I mean, we did. And I

26:18.641 --> 26:28.531
want you to read what this deputy Army commander 
said in this final evaluation about that sort of

26:18.641 --> 26:28.531
thing. But we convinced them. And the next year, 
I'm telling you, we were all over the 4th Army area.

26:36.199 --> 26:43.767
We sent people to the engineering, the diving 
school at Fort Eustis, Virginia.

26:45.248 --> 26:47.891
firefighters out to the A&M Fire School. We just 
sent people wherever they needed to be and you

26:49.313 --> 26:56.362
never saw morale rise in your life. They were so 
tired of going to Fort Poles and running off out in

26:57.023 --> 27:10.159
the woods and building the trail or building a 
bridge or whatever and we just really had a ball and

27:11.287 --> 27:23.131
We got more compliments from the Army staff about 
that operation, and we did that for the full rest of

27:11.287 --> 27:23.131
the time, and they're still doing it to a great 
degree. So they're continuing this program now?

27:25.215 --> 27:26.097
They have. It sold itself.
