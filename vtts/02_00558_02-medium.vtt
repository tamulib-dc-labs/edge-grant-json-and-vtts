00:03.845 --> 00:12.276
That might have been the biggest rumor about any 
concrete step taken by the U.S. I think the great

00:13.418 --> 00:26.055
disappointment of all the thinking Hungarians 
was the crisis of the Suez Canal right following on

00:13.418 --> 00:26.055
the Hungarian Revolution. it became obvious to us 
that in the confusion that the Soviet experienced

00:26.474 --> 00:44.020
in this totally unexpected revolution in 
Hungary, the British and the French took

00:26.474 --> 00:44.020
advantage and started the invasion of the Suez 
Canal. That was the greatest betrayal of the

00:44.641 --> 00:48.246
freedom fight. because it is manifested to the 
Hungarians that the West has other priorities

00:48.833 --> 00:57.621
than Eastern Europe. And it has also shown that in 
the Middle East, even armed intervention for the

00:58.782 --> 01:17.119
oil interests of the West is imaginable, but for 
Eastern Europe, no such risk will be ever taken. I

01:17.690 --> 01:22.696
think I learned about the West quite a bit from that 
step. I have not been bitter, nor am I really

01:23.977 --> 01:36.110
ultimately bitter today, I think I just developed 
a healthy amount of cynicism, which I still

01:23.977 --> 01:36.110
preserved. And every thinking person should be 
realistic about the way oil rules the world. Okay.

01:47.390 --> 01:50.354
I'd like to talk a little bit about how you came to 
come to the United States. Well, my coming to the

01:50.935 --> 02:00.470
United States does not parallel the way most of the 
refugees of 1956 came to this country. The

02:02.533 --> 02:16.654
revolution

02:02.533 --> 02:16.654
was followed by an exodus of 200,000 Hungarians, 
most of them young, and most of them educated to the

02:02.533 --> 02:16.654
West. and the way I considered the West that I have 
seen, because I myself fled the country on the 21st

02:17.309 --> 02:45.882
of November, so less than a month after the 
revolution, I felt that the West was tremendously

02:17.309 --> 02:45.882
helpful, just to say I'm a Hungarian meant in the 
first few weeks after my departure from Hungary, a

02:47.043 --> 02:52.590
free ticket to any country, and that the US 
included. I think the first 50,000

02:53.150 --> 03:05.746
people leaving Hungary virtually had a free 
choice of choosing any country of immigration.

03:07.488 --> 03:12.814
Such places as Switzerland, which has never had an 
open immigration policy, opened its borders for

03:13.267 --> 03:18.593
10,000 Hungarian immigrants. And of course, the 
U.S. had dramatically increased its contingent,

03:19.474 --> 03:36.214
its quota for Hungarian refugees, so that had I 
said right upon my arrival to Vienna that I want to

03:19.474 --> 03:36.214
go to the U.S., within a week I could have arrived 
here. But at that time, I wanted to go to Rome and

03:36.815 --> 03:42.582
study, plus I had a brother, refugee of earlier 
years living in Vienna and actually running a very

03:43.220 --> 04:11.573
good business so I did not even consider coming to 
the US at that time it was only after finishing my

03:43.220 --> 04:11.573
studies in Rome that my order has decided that I 
should join our foundation in Texas by the way our

03:43.220 --> 04:11.573
foundation just came about at the time of the 
Hungarian Revolution the monastery in Dallas has

04:12.717 --> 04:20.547
just started a few months before the revolution 
broke out. In 1955 we came to, our first group came

04:20.647 --> 04:29.819
to this place, and it was in 56 that the first wing of 
the Abbey was opened.

04:32.743 --> 04:39.552
But I came here of course only in 1962, at the time I 
was already a westernized

04:40.747 --> 04:54.948
after I had lived for six years in Western Europe 
and got very much acquainted with the other half of

04:40.747 --> 04:54.948
the world, which up to that time was completely 
sealed and unknown to me. I arrived to the West as

04:55.670 --> 05:01.799
coming to a completely different world. Okay. In 
retrospect, what do you see as the

05:04.583 --> 05:07.868
accomplishments of the revolution well the the 
revolution did not accomplish anything that it

05:08.303 --> 05:35.087
was it has set out to accomplish at the same time it 
has accomplished a lot of things that it did not

05:08.303 --> 05:35.087
really intend to immediate success was and that is 
unfortunately again in was in favor of of other

05:08.303 --> 05:35.087
people than than the ones who fought and died, the 
immediate success appeared first of all in

05:35.742 --> 05:42.628
Western Europe. The French Communist Party and 
the Italian Communist Party literally fell apart

05:42.968 --> 05:53.098
in the aftermath of the Hungarian Revolution. The 
strength of the communist movement in Western

05:53.858 --> 06:03.707
Europe was based first of all and most of all on the 
tremendous brilliance of the French Communist

06:04.092 --> 06:06.776
Party. The French Communist Party, as people 
might still recall, included the best minds of the

06:06.796 --> 06:13.446
country. Jean-Paul Sartre himself was a 
communist, and Jean-Paul Sartre left the

06:14.367 --> 06:26.444
Communist Party a few weeks after the Hungarian 
Revolution. So, the Communist Party has lost

06:27.145 --> 06:33.795
membership and votes in the decade following the 
Hungarian Revolution. As a consequence, what was

06:39.428 --> 06:51.219
a danger in the West, namely communist takeover 
either in Italy or France

06:39.428 --> 06:51.219
ceased to exist. And so that was a, I think, a great 
service for freedom in Western Europe. And you

06:59.226 --> 07:03.090
might say that on the long run the communist 
movement in Western Europe has never recovered

07:03.695 --> 07:08.783
from that loss. It peaked before the Hungarian 
Revolution and has never reached that same peak.

07:15.393 --> 07:19.780
Maybe in Italy it did, but by the time in Italy it 
came back again, with a large number of votes, the

07:20.131 --> 07:30.203
communist movement has disassociated itself 
from Russia. So, in a sense, that was a deadly loss

07:30.503 --> 07:39.915
and defeat for the Western European communist 
movement. I think the Hungarians should be proud

07:39.935 --> 07:44.600
of having achieved that, without having tried it. 
Another thing which Hungary now enjoys to a great

07:45.842 --> 07:50.087
extent is the

07:50.725 --> 07:57.415
relaxation of the communist system in Hungary. 
That did not take place immediately, but the gulag

07:57.435 --> 08:12.879
communism, as we call it now, has been in a way the 
product of the atmosphere which came about after

07:57.435 --> 08:12.879
the revolution.

08:15.784 --> 08:16.665
The Hungarian leaders, the puppet government of 
Janos Kadar, that has been put into place after the

08:17.270 --> 08:41.516
revolution, got a considerable amount of 
freedoms in economic planning, and later on even

08:17.270 --> 08:41.516
in the political course it has chosen to follow. 
Consequently, today Hungary enjoys more

08:44.793 --> 09:05.577
economic welfare and also more

08:44.793 --> 09:05.577
liberal policies and human rights than the other 
communist countries do. The fact that all the

09:06.779 --> 09:13.787
refugees, practically all the refugees of the 
1956 revolution, received amnesty and are free to

09:14.257 --> 09:18.141
go back to Hungary and visit. And the Hungarian 
press refers to the revolution of 1956 less and

09:19.383 --> 09:41.428
less as to a counter-revolution, but more and more 
as to the terrible events of October 1956, shows

09:19.383 --> 09:41.428
that they really don't want to hold up this as a 
threat or a record against any one of those

09:41.763 --> 09:52.020
participants who fled to the West. So the climate 
has changed in the 60s, about a decade after the

09:52.621 --> 10:04.200
revolution, the system has relaxed and 
accomplished quite a turnaround. Whether or not

10:05.201 --> 10:07.365
this is really very good for the country, 
Solzhenitsyn probably would disagree because I

10:07.919 --> 10:19.395
think while welfare was established the soul was 
lost. Today my contemporaries in Hungary

10:20.677 --> 10:29.269
wouldn't want to see another revolution if they 
can help it. They have learned their lesson

10:29.289 --> 10:37.200
because there was an awful lot of suffering coming 
out of the revolution itself and they cherish the

10:37.703 --> 10:46.712
little advantage they have managed to obtain at 
the price of the bloodshed in 1956. So, a new

10:46.772 --> 10:58.704
Hungary came about which is more cynical, less 
idealistic and totally resigned to the Soviet

10:46.772 --> 10:58.704
dominion. So, in a way, the Soviets have 
established themselves forever in the aftermath

11:07.268 --> 11:23.972
But we gained little freedoms that we cherish, and 
we will think it over twice before we say anything

11:07.268 --> 11:23.972
dirty against the Soviets in big publicity, while 
we are allowed not to say anything about the Soviet

11:07.268 --> 11:23.972
in our private circles. Okay. Now that you've 
lived in the United States for about 20 years, how

11:27.157 --> 11:36.651
do you see certain things such as the Cold War, the 
Red Scare feeling in the United States during

11:27.157 --> 11:36.651
that? Well, I think I have a double feeling. 
Basically,

11:42.298 --> 12:06.233
I am concerned about both the dumb, shortsighted, 
uninformed rhetoric of the ultraconservative

11:42.298 --> 12:06.233
right wing, which tries to artificially keep up 
the Red Scare without having intelligent

12:06.517 --> 12:15.908
propaganda to offer, because basically the 
rhetoric goes without any solid information. On

12:16.689 --> 12:33.688
the other hand, the liberal

12:16.689 --> 12:33.688
movements that try to downplay the Red Scare are 
just as short-sighted and uninformed. so I feel

12:34.242 --> 13:04.148
that the basic facts of life are that this country 
remains isolated in in terms of information and

12:34.242 --> 13:04.148
perspective from the rest of the world and as a 
consequence we do not have a public opinion that is

12:34.242 --> 13:04.148
realistic about our place and role in worldwide 
dimensions one of the typical things that I might

13:04.887 --> 13:31.924
quote is the fact that even our diplomats in the 
Soviet Union do not speak Russian, and our general

13:04.887 --> 13:31.924
public keeps on being geographically and 
historically ignorant about the past, about

13:04.887 --> 13:31.924
dangers of the present, and about the nature of the 
Soviet, of the communist movement. So you either

13:32.798 --> 13:59.576
have one kind of propaganda or another, but there 
is no core of well-informed, thoughtful,

13:32.798 --> 13:59.576
intelligent people who would responsibly build a 
public opinion that is realistic and bases the

13:32.798 --> 13:59.576
decisions on facts rather than feelings and 
immediate selfish interests. A lot of

14:01.339 --> 14:02.400
politicians use the writing rhetoric in order to 
win votes, rather than any other purpose. So I'm a

14:10.282 --> 14:14.647
little bit discouraged, but I must say I got used to 
it. I do not expect people to know the facts of

14:15.789 --> 14:22.957
history, or even the facts of geography. So what 
the Soviet empire really is, what problems it has,

14:25.280 --> 14:35.769
and how it really relates to its own internal 
problems. We have a lot of tasks to educate the

14:35.789 --> 14:42.115
public, but I don't see the people really involved 
in doing it. Very quickly, could you describe what

14:42.135 --> 14:45.417
you think the Soviet Union is? Well, I think the 
Soviet Union carries an awful lot of internal

14:47.279 --> 14:54.105
problems with it, but we should not rejoice and say 
that it will destroy itself on that account. I

14:57.870 --> 15:05.298
think, on the one hand, we must see that the Soviet 
is a system loaded with problems. On the other

15:05.859 --> 15:19.114
hand, the problems that the Soviets have make them 
even more aggressive rather than less ready to

15:05.859 --> 15:19.114
strike out and risk confrontation and even war 
with us. And this we do not easily understand

15:19.600 --> 15:34.019
because we think that if we have economic 
problems, for example, then we are less

15:19.600 --> 15:34.019
interested in spending on defense and we are more 
interested in spending on our own problems and

15:19.600 --> 15:34.019
solve our own problems. All those, the logic of the 
Soviet is exactly the reverse of what, of the logic

15:35.121 --> 15:42.891
by which this country lives. And I think most of our 
mistakes come from the fact that we don't realize

15:43.462 --> 15:51.930
that the system has a different internal logic. I 
think that the Soviets are a constant threat to the

15:51.950 --> 16:00.398
rest of the world, and also to this country. 
However, that doesn't mean that their system is

16:01.399 --> 16:04.702
superior. Their system is running into more and 
more problems. As a consequence, they are even

16:09.366 --> 16:13.350
more tempted to take the risks of large 
confrontations in order to get out of their

16:13.550 --> 16:25.143
problems by, you might say, robbing other 
countries. Okay. Also, there was a, it's a

16:25.944 --> 16:37.617
situation that ran vaguely similar, the 
situation in Vietnam, which there was a war, I

16:25.944 --> 16:37.617
suppose, against communism. but specifically, 
how do you feel about the large influx of refugees

16:37.867 --> 16:45.357
coming to the United States after you've seen the 
large influx of Hungarians coming to the United

16:37.867 --> 16:45.357
States? Well, I think one has to be open and helpful 
to the people who are in need, and that I say on a

16:46.879 --> 17:05.202
general scale as a conviction. I think especially 
the Vietnamese refugees, had the right even to be

17:07.010 --> 17:18.046
helped by America more than the Hungarian 
refugees had the right to be helped. There is some

17:18.086 --> 17:28.220
parallelism, though, because I think in both 
cases, the tragedy that has taken place involved

17:18.086 --> 17:28.220
the United States one way or another. In Vietnam, I 
think the United States was much more involved

17:28.581 --> 17:35.110
than in Hungary.

17:35.663 --> 17:45.213
Of course, do not think that as a consequence, you 
know, anybody at any time wanting to come to this

17:35.663 --> 17:45.213
country should be given a free ticket. But, of 
course, the country is still wrestling with its

17:45.633 --> 17:56.704
own identity and in defining its own policies of 
immigration. This is a country of people who

17:56.724 --> 18:02.430
themselves are the descendants of immigrants, 
and therefore it would be very difficult to close

18:03.288 --> 18:13.678
the borders to further immigrants if we are 
ourselves immigrants or the grandchildren or

18:03.288 --> 18:13.678
great-grandchildren of immigrants. So it's, 
yeah, there is a moral question here, also a

18:13.698 --> 18:21.867
long-range policy setting and an assessment of 
the resources of the country. And I really don't

18:21.887 --> 18:24.890
know where the limits should be placed. Okay. 
Father Denis, how do you feel that the United

18:27.372 --> 18:32.097
States should react now and in the near future? to 
or should handle its self-diplomacy with the

18:32.566 --> 18:40.417
Soviet satellites, Hungary and those countries 
in the Soviet Union itself?

18:45.184 --> 18:47.267
I may not really. I probably have stopped thinking 
about how this country should operate. In the last

18:55.079 --> 19:00.767
20 years, I became cynical enough to wonder only 
how it is going to operate. I think it will operate

19:04.018 --> 19:14.389
according to its perceived interests, rather 
than any lofty principles of any sort. I don't see

19:16.632 --> 19:23.919
anything wrong with you following your own 
principles, I just wish that those principles

19:16.632 --> 19:23.919
would be a little more far-sighted. At the present 
time, the United States is still involved in a

19:29.941 --> 19:58.817
scheme that came about in the Kennedy years namely 
cooperation coexistence and hope for loosening

19:29.941 --> 19:58.817
of the Soviet system by economic and cultural 
cultural exchange I don't think that this will

19:29.941 --> 19:58.817
change unless the Soviets unless the Soviet 
changes its mind in other words we will give

19:59.303 --> 20:10.133
foreign aid, loan, help of any sort, to the extent 
we can do business with them. There are, I simply

20:10.153 --> 20:16.238
see, no possibility for this country to change its 
course. I mean, the most blatant case was the

20:16.258 --> 20:19.862
grains sale. We are selling grain to the Soviet 
Union, not because we are merciful to the hungry

20:20.542 --> 20:26.948
people there, but because otherwise our farmers 
will be upset. As a consequence, we will do

20:31.043 --> 20:38.994
business with that part of the country as long as we 
can do profitably business with them. I think that

20:40.035 --> 20:55.956
this is not necessarily a bad policy, but, well, 
this also means that there is no way for us to keep

20:40.035 --> 20:55.956
the to change the situation of the world over there 
in any significant way. I may not admire this

21:04.208 --> 21:22.872
country for what has taken place in the last 20 
years, and yet, at the same time, I say, well, maybe

21:04.208 --> 21:22.872
we have eased the brutality of of the Soviet system 
to some extent in some countries, like Hungary

21:23.560 --> 21:43.281
itself, which received a lot of financial and 
other aid from the United States through an

21:23.560 --> 21:43.281
increase of foreign exchange. I don't know.

21:51.320 --> 21:56.386
I don't see any solution for these great problems 
of the world. I think we are living in the, living

21:56.406 --> 22:06.838
out the consequences of what has taken place after 
the Second World War. And I don't think anybody

22:06.858 --> 22:13.285
knows how to solve the problems, realistically. I 
am of the conviction that the present system of

22:21.880 --> 22:25.606
of defeat and problems is better than a nuclear 
war. As a consequence, I certainly would not say

22:27.970 --> 22:38.426
that we should inch

22:27.970 --> 22:38.426
our way to a nuclear confrontation.

22:41.130 --> 22:49.744
I would like to see this country being more willing 
to make sacrifices for the freedom it possesses.

22:50.129 --> 23:19.917
and be less blatantly selfish and hedonistic in 
just trying to do everything in order to improve

22:50.129 --> 23:19.917
its living standard I feel that we have gotten into 
a mentality that might cost our most precious

22:50.129 --> 23:19.917
freedom one of these days but how can this logic be 
changed we are sort of slipping into a mentality in

22:50.129 --> 23:19.917
which even the most conservative, Republican, 
right-wing elements in this country would make a

23:20.234 --> 23:44.571
decision in favor of the economy as the first 
priority, regardless of any worldwide

23:20.234 --> 23:44.571
consequences for the future of freedom. That 
seems to be the most discouraging. uh, aspect of,

23:49.360 --> 23:54.451
of our present mentality that we have 
established. And I don't think that, uh, even,

23:55.273 --> 23:59.523
even Reagan has a different mind. Okay. Thank you, 
Father Dennis. I appreciate it. I enjoyed this.
