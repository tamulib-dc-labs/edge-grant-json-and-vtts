00:02.933 --> 00:11.106
August the 7th, I believe it is, which is Guadalcanal Day, 59 years ago today.

00:12.148 --> 00:12.809
Test yours.

00:13.390 --> 00:14.913
Testing 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:17.136 --> 00:26.311
August 7, we're in the Dean's Conference Room, Room 101, Veterinary Medicine, and a third interview with Dr. J.D.

00:26.371 --> 00:26.832
McCready.

00:27.605 --> 00:34.154
Dr. McCready, when we quit the second interview, we were somewhere in the 1980s.

00:35.896 --> 00:41.063
By then, you had become involved in a wide variety of special programs.

00:41.643 --> 00:49.073
What led you to become so committed to the broadening of the program in veterinary medicine?

00:50.133 --> 01:05.362
Well, I think the major impact on my life was my postdoctoral training in the Texas Medical Center, which is the largest medical center in the world.

01:05.382 --> 01:12.175
It has two medical schools, VA hospital, dental school, cancer center,

01:12.560 --> 01:16.745
Center for Religion, Center for Everything, Nursing.

01:17.886 --> 01:37.167
And that center was so dynamic and so many things were happening and the people were such futuristic individuals as far as their thinking that being engrossed in that environment for a number of years, in fact,

01:37.147 --> 01:51.700
still hold faculty appointments at MD Anderson and at Baylor College of Medicine and still frequent the facilities and have contact with the faculty.

01:52.320 --> 02:07.153
But to see the dynamics of that center and the type of people they brought in, also to see medicine changing so rapidly from a very

02:07.133 --> 02:17.567
archaic, we would think now, to the technology input we were seeing now hour by hour rather than year by year.

02:19.209 --> 02:29.884
When I came back, I thought, and I had the support of the Medical Center faculty, our leadership, and Dr. Butler, the president of Baylor College of Medicine,

02:30.539 --> 02:33.405
and Dr. LaMater, president of MD Anderson.

02:34.327 --> 02:43.267
Having those people backing and wanting to have a relationship with Texas A.M.

02:43.287 --> 02:46.033
University, particularly because of veterinary medicine,

02:46.013 --> 03:04.643
They were instrumental in my desires to see our college elevate itself to the status of those two major institutions in the Texas Medical Center.

03:04.663 --> 03:08.089
And so that impacted my thinking as to

03:08.069 --> 03:11.895
and my actions through that period of time.

03:11.975 --> 03:28.879
And fortunately, I had a dean at that time that was very, very supportive, very, very good at delegating and letting people do their own thing, and that was Dr. George Shelton.

03:30.158 --> 03:31.561
No, who?

03:31.581 --> 03:32.402
George Shelton.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.827
Oh, yes.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.911
I didn't hear Dr. Shelton's last name.

03:38.534 --> 03:48.353
Who else on the faculty in veterinary medicine was also active in working with other medical

03:48.890 --> 03:49.591
components?

03:50.972 --> 03:56.997
Well, you have to look at our college and its origin.

03:57.878 --> 04:05.624
And I think, as I pointed out in our last interview, we had about seven or eight people that built the foundation for the college.

04:05.684 --> 04:13.651
And I mentioned those, Dr. Miller, Dr. Leonard, Dr. Turk, Dr. Burns, Dr. Jaggi, and Dr. Smith, and that group.

04:14.252 --> 04:17.935
And they were still, they were active up until the 70s.

04:18.353 --> 04:30.454
But they built an academic veterinary medicine that has turned out to build into probably one of the better schools in the country.

04:31.375 --> 04:38.387
But with that foundation and teaching being their main interest,

04:38.367 --> 05:00.747
Once we had built a teaching faculty, and I felt strongly about having a good teaching faculty, then we were able, through increased enrollment in our undergraduate program in biomedical science and doubling of our veterinary

05:00.727 --> 05:07.013
the student body, the development of graduate degrees and programs.

05:07.834 --> 05:22.147
Then we were able to justify additional faculty, which we could point toward research and the technology development that was on the horizon.

05:22.207 --> 05:29.974
So through those people such as, and we didn't have lots, I mean, to start out with.

05:30.730 --> 05:49.363
I know the first chair we had and the first person I brought in of that caliber, well, not necessarily the first one, but was Dr. Steve Safe, whose record speaks for itself, Dr. Dwayne Kramer, certainly, and of course one of the real first

05:49.900 --> 05:58.311
scholars in a way scholar would have been Dr. Hilton Smith who wrote the textbook on veterinary pathology.

05:59.052 --> 06:04.440
But with that base we began to add more and more faculty.

06:04.480 --> 06:19.300
Dr. Jim Womack came in from our Institute of Comparative Medicine and slowly we began to add outstanding people so that now we have

06:19.803 --> 06:34.404
people that have been selected to the National Academy of Science and many other awards and international recognition and research, NIH research centers have been established and things of that nature.

06:35.225 --> 06:44.899
Of the many programs that you worked on that involved collaboration,

06:45.773 --> 06:51.481
Which ones were the most important and which ones were the most enjoyable?

06:52.703 --> 07:03.158
Well, and we mentioned this a bit before, but starting out really with Dr. Stanley Olson, the president of Baylor,

07:03.779 --> 07:17.680
and his desire to set up an Institute of Comparative Medicine, that beginning in the late 60s, set a precedent.

07:17.700 --> 07:25.872
It brought, when he and I came to A&M to talk to the Executive Committee about establishing such a relationship,

07:25.852 --> 07:37.688
with these very fine faculty department heads we had, they were very supportive of us setting up that institute.

07:38.609 --> 07:43.555
And so we began to put it together.

07:43.695 --> 07:52.467
We were able to get, with the support of Dr. Olson and Dr. DeBakey, them to carry this

07:52.852 --> 07:59.363
item to Austin for funding and we received funding for the Institute of Comparative Medicine.

08:00.184 --> 08:07.637
And then off of that we built many, many research programs and interrelated programs.

08:08.258 --> 08:18.514
Coming out of that was the development of our medical school here, which was to have clinical science relationship to the Texas Medical Center.

08:19.615 --> 08:31.353
And also the Institute of Biological Sciences and Technology, an 11-story building we built at the Shamrock Hilton site in Houston.

08:31.373 --> 08:37.202
And just program after program,

08:37.182 --> 09:00.625
with collaboration again with the medical center in Houston and then later with other medical centers and the development of the medical school at the Texas A&M and then Texas A&M began to grow and it took on a dental school of its own and we put together a nursing school for Prairie View in Houston and

09:01.060 --> 09:09.693
All this thing evolved back to this initial contact in the 60s with the Baylor College of Medicine.

09:10.935 --> 09:19.728
The deans of veterinary medicine have been very critical to all of this.

09:20.769 --> 09:26.798
You began your academic service here with Al Price.

09:27.082 --> 09:27.823
Dean, didn't you?

09:29.065 --> 09:36.654
Well, I guess maybe the first year or so was Dr. Armistead.

09:36.915 --> 09:37.475
Oh, okay.

09:37.495 --> 09:38.296
And then Dr. Price.

09:38.316 --> 09:39.358
And then Dr. Price.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.741
Then Dr. Shelton.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.243
Dr. Shelton.

09:43.844 --> 09:50.372
And I believe we talked about his selection and how he was selected.

09:50.352 --> 09:55.479
How do you think the faculty in general felt about Dr. Shelton as the dean?

09:56.881 --> 10:04.791
Well, I thought Dr. Shelton was, had a good rapport with the faculty.

10:05.172 --> 10:09.998
He never, in other words, he never tried to

10:09.978 --> 10:15.406
to force programs or such as that onto the faculty.

10:16.127 --> 10:23.698
He always worked with them in a very, oh, using his department heads.

10:23.778 --> 10:36.576
At that time, we had seven or eight people on the executive committee, and he used them as a sounding board and really did not

10:36.556 --> 10:49.071
try to force any programs or changes into the college that were not approved and accepted by the executive committee and the faculty.

10:49.111 --> 10:51.594
And so he worked closely with them.

10:51.654 --> 10:57.702
And as I said, he was always, his office was always open.

10:57.782 --> 11:04.470
He always was there to help you if you needed help, if you needed resources, if you needed

11:05.260 --> 11:11.277
contact on campus to try to promote a program.

11:11.397 --> 11:20.603
So he was just a very, very gentle man and very helpful, I think.

11:20.836 --> 11:25.900
And the executive committee during those years was made up of the department heads?

11:26.001 --> 11:46.419
The department heads, and we had also the director of the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, the assistant deans, our assistants to the deans eventually became associate deans, director of clinics.

11:47.099 --> 11:50.202
We must have had 12, 15 people on the executive committee.

11:50.182 --> 11:53.787
And they normally met once a week?

11:53.807 --> 11:57.091
Once a week, usually for about a half day.

11:58.212 --> 12:17.877
During those years, the 70s, 80s, the department head was not expected to submit everything, every recommendation or decision to a vote of the faculty, that the department head was expected to

12:18.329 --> 12:23.607
to make a decision that that individual thought was best.

12:23.668 --> 12:24.272
Is that right?

12:24.826 --> 12:25.788
Oh, that's right.

12:25.888 --> 12:31.376
We didn't have selection committees for faculty or any other positions.

12:31.416 --> 12:48.724
The department head pretty well recruited, usually would bring in the individual being recruited to visit with the faculty to try to sell them on the department.

12:49.261 --> 12:56.088
and the program, but never were committees or votes taken or anything like that.

12:57.169 --> 13:10.002
Do you remember during those years, do you remember any faculty member prospects that got away that in hindsight wished, A&M wished they could have gotten?

13:12.384 --> 13:15.908
You know, I've thought about that many times.

13:16.348 --> 13:17.850
I think that

13:18.505 --> 13:21.349
I know I can speak mainly to my department.

13:21.529 --> 13:25.915
I don't think there's anyone that we ever recruited that we did not get.

13:25.935 --> 13:45.002
Now, the way that I did recruit faculty, I went to all the major scientific meetings in the country each year to observe young graduates

13:44.982 --> 14:08.374
students as they gave papers and seminars etc and so I kept a backlog of people that I would like to recruit and whenever we had a vacancy or an opening I would I would go back through my list people that had impressed me and invite them for a visit to the campus

14:08.354 --> 14:33.248
And when we did that, of course we went through, they met, they met the dean and they met our fellow faculty people in the department and they were well received and then they were taken over to the university to the

14:33.228 --> 14:51.213
administrative officers there, and then Haskell Monroe or somebody else like him would spend time with these individuals, an hour or so sometimes, going over the growth of the university and everything that was good about it.

14:52.374 --> 14:59.404
And then, normally these visits were about two-day faculty visits, and then

14:59.384 --> 15:04.631
The way I, I never made a faculty member an offer.

15:06.594 --> 15:27.062
After we hosted them for a period of couple days, when they left, I always said, if you're interested in Texas A&M University, you write me a letter stipulating what you would want in the way of salary,

15:27.903 --> 15:35.191
research space, startup dollars, and what have you.

15:35.952 --> 15:37.814
I never gave them a salary level.

15:37.914 --> 15:53.472
I never gave them startup dollar levels or anything, because I knew that if I was way off, that they would not be happy.

15:53.452 --> 15:58.377
And so I let them come back to me with a salary and start up funds.

15:59.739 --> 16:07.327
And if it was such that we couldn't cover that amount, I frankly told them so.

16:09.129 --> 16:14.715
In some instances, they came in too low, and so I would increase the amount.

16:15.455 --> 16:21.602
But I always let them tell me what it would require.

16:21.987 --> 16:27.434
And then I would go to the administration and try to fulfill that requirement.

16:28.416 --> 16:36.987
And this way, they, when they came, they got what they wanted, I suppose.

16:37.007 --> 16:45.278
What were, as you recall, those years of being a recruiter, what were the

16:45.832 --> 16:51.551
biggest obstacles Texas A&M Veterinary Medicine had in recruiting faculty here?

16:52.915 --> 16:56.467
Well, that you have to look over a period of time.

16:57.209 --> 16:58.052
For example,

16:59.062 --> 17:06.774
Uh, our department, when I came back, took our department, I think we only had three people in the department.

17:07.355 --> 17:15.788
And so we had, uh, eventually went to thirty-something people plus seventy graduate students over a period of time.

17:16.770 --> 17:24.782
But when I first started recruiting faculty in, uh, and sixty, mid-sixties,

17:24.762 --> 17:33.875
When we had them come to visit, we didn't even have a hotel or a place for them to live or to stay.

17:35.297 --> 17:40.384
We didn't have any housing ready built for them as a rule.

17:42.347 --> 17:44.270
So it was quite difficult.

17:44.410 --> 17:49.858
The recruiting environment was not real good.

17:49.838 --> 17:57.823
In fact, in those days, we couldn't even use state funds to recruit them.

17:58.208 --> 18:01.273
And so lots of that had to come out of our own pocket.

18:02.054 --> 18:08.403
I finally got the former students association to put money at the department level.

18:08.884 --> 18:13.090
Dr. Jack Knox was the president of the former students, one of our graduates.

18:13.210 --> 18:19.479
And I got him to put in so much for her department.

18:19.780 --> 18:25.448
And we finally got some flexible dollars we could use a bit when we were recruiting.

18:25.428 --> 18:36.159
But it was a tough, it was a, you had to do lots of planning to set up a recruiting visit, to say the least.

18:36.760 --> 18:50.695
Was the, by comparison, was the, in those years, the community being small, was that a greater handicap than the institution?

18:50.795 --> 18:53.798
Was the institution's reputation better than the community's?

18:54.655 --> 19:22.215
Well, one thing in recruiting in veterinary medicine that was somewhat in our favor of being a small community and a fairly large agricultural college or university is that most, if you look at most veterinary colleges, they're all located in very small communities.

19:22.297 --> 19:38.804
I mean except like in Philadelphia and a few places, but therefore that was, they were not surprised by the kind of rural environment to which they were coming.

19:39.866 --> 19:46.617
In those early years, if you were going to take them to eat in an upscale

19:47.609 --> 19:48.490
restaurant.

19:48.550 --> 19:49.451
Where did you take them?

19:49.752 --> 20:06.314
Well, we didn't have but one, and that was the Texan, I guess, and it was kind of a unique little place, but we just didn't have any restaurants or, or hotels.

20:06.955 --> 20:13.363
We had a little place called, well, the Agland Inn had three rooms in it, I think, and MSC had about

20:14.002 --> 20:20.991
I had about 10, and then they had the Bluebird courts, and that was about it.

20:21.271 --> 20:27.619
And very, it was a difficult situation, to say the least.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.602
All right, back to the deans.

20:30.323 --> 20:43.620
Dr. Shelton retired in the... I think Dr. Shelton must have retired in about, let's see, about 80, 88, or...

20:44.090 --> 20:46.193
something like that.

20:46.273 --> 20:49.317
I can't remember exactly.

20:50.799 --> 21:02.795
And as far as you're aware, did the veterinary public in Texas feel positively about his years here?

21:03.475 --> 21:04.357
I think so.

21:04.377 --> 21:07.701
As I say, he was such a

21:08.896 --> 21:26.432
easy individual to work with, and he worked with the various commodity groups in agriculture and worked well with the university administration.

21:26.412 --> 21:36.373
He just did not ruffle any feathers.

21:37.897 --> 21:45.012
Did you ever know of him losing his temper or getting mad?

21:45.953 --> 21:51.301
I don't remember him ever getting upset at me.

21:51.782 --> 21:53.224
I don't even remember anybody else.

21:53.244 --> 22:05.042
I know he had plenty of reason to be upset at me from time to time because I was involved in so many activities outside the college.

22:06.068 --> 22:07.750
and throughout the state.

22:09.313 --> 22:21.190
And it was, it was not my intent, but I didn't include him in all of these activities many times until after the fact.

22:21.771 --> 22:27.199
But he never, never was upset about it.

22:27.239 --> 22:29.282
He just simply said, where can I help?

22:31.646 --> 22:34.590
Then when, when he retired,

22:35.110 --> 22:40.666
there was a search, and weren't you one of the people seriously considered in that search?

22:41.549 --> 22:48.850
Well, in that search, I was selected by 85 percent of the faculty, but...

22:49.555 --> 23:00.954
There was an overnight change in the administration in the College of Agriculture, and the counselor was fairly new.

23:01.094 --> 23:07.585
And in order to get the dean of agriculture, the dean of agriculture said he had to bring his own animal man.

23:07.966 --> 23:14.837
And so I was essentially removed from that.

23:14.817 --> 23:17.924
It turned out better for me in the long run.

23:18.004 --> 23:26.143
My experiences were broad and things went lots better and they brought in a very

23:28.064 --> 23:32.752
qualified individual as dean and one that had... That's Dr. Shattuck.

23:32.892 --> 23:34.315
Dr. John Shattuck.

23:34.435 --> 23:51.304
And he had, he had a good vision of research and came at a time when he, being friends to the Chancellor of Agriculture and Dean of Agriculture, and we needed new facilities badly,

23:51.284 --> 23:56.852
He had their full support since they were friends before the fight.

23:57.152 --> 24:02.419
Who was that ag dean and vice chancellor?

24:03.020 --> 24:10.891
Well, the chancellor was Perry Atkins and Charlie Arntzen.

24:11.372 --> 24:13.655
Arntzen, okay.

24:13.895 --> 24:16.559
They had been at Illinois together.

24:16.939 --> 24:18.962
Where was Shattuck immediately before coming here?

24:19.651 --> 24:21.515
I think probably at Illinois.

24:21.875 --> 24:22.136
Okay.

24:23.398 --> 24:23.939
I think.

24:23.959 --> 24:28.869
Now, Dean Gage had been one of the key members of Dean Shelton's staff.

24:28.949 --> 24:29.270
Right.

24:29.430 --> 24:31.634
He was the associate dean, is that right?

24:32.796 --> 24:32.917
Right.

24:33.939 --> 24:40.832
And is it correct that he kind of directed the day-to-day, I mean, hour-to-hour?

24:42.314 --> 24:43.275
Yeah.

24:44.177 --> 24:45.879
He was the chief of staff.

24:45.899 --> 24:46.580
Would that be a good?

24:46.781 --> 24:59.800
I think so, and that's where he moved to in the university administration, too, as senior vice president, and very well organized.

24:59.780 --> 25:07.974
I was chairman of the search committee that selected Dean to come as associate dean.

25:08.976 --> 25:11.861
And so, and I had known him as a student.

25:12.001 --> 25:22.159
And so, he's very, he's articulate, well organized, and did well at the university level too.

25:22.814 --> 25:28.993
When he left the college, who became the kind of chief of staff?

25:29.795 --> 25:33.246
Who kind of took on the task that he had?

25:34.795 --> 25:38.419
Oh, I can't remember the individual's name.

25:40.521 --> 25:51.854
We finally divided the activities there in the office so that we had kind of a dean or associate dean for academics and associate dean for research.

25:53.115 --> 25:58.761
And there were various individuals that came along that filled those positions.

25:58.741 --> 26:18.623
None of them, under Dr. Shattuck, the positions were essentially not functional because he, unlike Dr. Shelton, did not delegate.

26:18.823 --> 26:24.049
And so he carried all of this himself.

26:24.990 --> 26:26.892
Describe as much as you can

26:27.496 --> 26:33.225
the search process for the dean in which you were part, where there was a search committee.

26:33.265 --> 26:34.927
Yeah.

26:35.127 --> 26:41.817
And what did you and the other nominees, what did you all go through?

26:41.857 --> 26:47.666
Well, I guess it's a pretty standard procedure.

26:47.766 --> 26:50.230
We each were

26:51.728 --> 27:01.967
brought in and toured through and oversaw the budgets and met all the people on campus.

27:02.307 --> 27:05.974
About how many nominees, I mean finalists, were there?

27:07.196 --> 27:10.543
Oh, I think there were probably three or four.

27:11.524 --> 27:12.927
Were you the only local?

27:13.750 --> 27:15.772
Oh, no, I think not.

27:16.693 --> 27:20.177
I can't remember that exactly.

27:20.197 --> 27:27.465
But Dr. Shattuck was not in the mix in that search.

27:28.486 --> 27:32.510
It was an after-the-fact thing that occurred.

27:32.811 --> 27:36.515
As far as you know, did the search committee make a recommendation?

27:37.896 --> 27:41.580
Oh, yeah, the search committee made their recommendation.

27:41.712 --> 27:42.855
Did they recommend you?

27:43.597 --> 27:54.608
Yes, and then even after the other gentleman was selected, they sent a petition forward to that

27:56.275 --> 28:02.745
that they wanted me to serve as their dean.

28:02.785 --> 28:06.350
But again, things worked out so well.

28:07.552 --> 28:11.718
So you went back to what you had been, all these many activities.

28:12.319 --> 28:14.622
Were you still the department head?

28:14.990 --> 28:26.163
I was, I remained department head for a year or so, but had been asked to resign.

28:26.524 --> 28:33.612
And so I did so and followed another career.

28:34.573 --> 28:37.997
How, how was that request made?

28:38.077 --> 28:41.942
Was it, did the dean call you in or?

28:42.428 --> 28:48.394
Oh, there were lots of things, and I think it's probably better.

28:48.414 --> 28:51.217
I wouldn't want to.

28:52.138 --> 28:52.238
Okay.

28:52.578 --> 28:53.099
You want to leave for it?

28:53.159 --> 28:53.399
Oh, no.

28:53.539 --> 28:54.861
No, I just don't.

28:54.881 --> 28:55.221
Okay.

28:55.241 --> 28:55.742
No, that's fine.

28:55.762 --> 29:08.875
It doesn't help me to, as I say, that he was very articulate, very astute, very intelligent, very dynamic, very active person, and I think he

29:08.855 --> 29:15.684
He came at a good time, and he was able to acquire more resources than I could have required.

29:16.665 --> 29:28.560
Now, he remained as dean until about— I think he was dean about five or six years, probably.

29:29.241 --> 29:33.867
Then he—did he leave?

29:34.505 --> 29:35.847
Retire?

29:36.368 --> 29:42.897
Nobody knows all of the circumstances involved in why Dr. Shattuck left.

29:43.458 --> 29:47.063
We know that he did take a job with private sector.

29:48.665 --> 29:53.712
And then the interim dean and what's his first name?

29:53.995 --> 29:56.097
Bob Plater, Robert Plater.

29:56.277 --> 29:58.179
Was he a local faculty member?

29:58.199 --> 29:59.280
Yes, he was.

30:00.621 --> 30:12.552
He had been head of the small animal clinics and I guess maybe had functioned as a associate dean for clinics.

30:12.712 --> 30:13.793
I'm not real sure.

30:13.854 --> 30:16.716
I can't remember the sequence.

30:17.857 --> 30:22.922
Was it generally understood that he would be only the interim?

30:23.172 --> 30:49.213
Yes, he left here as head of our small animal clinic and went to Cornell to help them build their, he had built our clinic, was here under the construction of our small animal clinic, and he went to Cornell to help them develop a new clinic, and then he was hired back here as a social dean, I think, something like that.

30:50.797 --> 30:54.701
All right, then the search that led to Richard Adams.

30:56.744 --> 31:11.400
Describe that as far as your... Well, I essentially, in 1991, I was, I moved from the College of Veterinary Medicine.

31:12.982 --> 31:16.045
And... To where?
