00:01.347 --> 00:01.727
R.D. Brown. Dr. Billy Tremere has asked me to give a 
brief rundown on my background before reflecting

00:02.949 --> 00:13.039
on my association with Dr. U.E. Mourning.

00:16.803 --> 00:23.150
I grew up on a farm in Callahan County near Putnam, 
Texas, which is 35 miles east of Abilene. Our

00:24.231 --> 00:29.076
county is a farming and ranching economy with 
limited oil and gas production. My family

00:33.909 --> 00:40.398
consisted of my parents, one brother, and one 
sister, both younger than I. My parents were

00:42.642 --> 00:53.899
hardworking, quality people who believed in 
teaching their children to work and be

00:42.642 --> 00:53.899
productive. We were given regular test at a early 
age to perform.

01:03.050 --> 01:07.134
With the understanding that these duties were a 
must and some. Form of punishment.

01:13.041 --> 01:15.003
Would result if these duties. Weren't carried 
out.

01:20.229 --> 01:24.173
They always compliment us on on a job well done. We 
were a happy family due to the quality of our

01:26.296 --> 01:30.482
parents. Study and education.

01:36.010 --> 01:36.812
Was it must? And we knew the reason why. They 
impressed us with the idea that a college

01:39.716 --> 01:51.173
education was necessary in order to make the most 
of our opportunities in life.

01:57.110 --> 01:59.052
I graduated from high school in 1935. The Great 
Depression was in full bloom and the family funds

01:59.092 --> 02:09.705
were not available at that time to assist me in 
college. My dad asked me to stay and help him with

02:10.946 --> 02:17.373
reducing the family debt. For three years I worked 
on the family farms and on the on community farms

02:23.958 --> 02:28.805
and ranches and in the oil fields of West Texas. 
With the family debt under control, I enrolled at

02:30.367 --> 02:38.819
A&M in pre-veterinary medicine. In September of 
38, I was assigned to A Company Infantry Corps

02:40.321 --> 02:46.110
Cadets.

02:50.476 --> 02:51.838
Texas A&M College The core cadets. Hazing and life 
in general. Was a different ball game for me.

03:06.032 --> 03:07.434
I learned to take the hazing. And I enjoyed all 
forms. Of college life from the first day on. The

03:17.148 --> 03:18.350
discipline was great. Fish and sophomores had 
better be in their rooms studying at 7 PM. We were

03:26.561 --> 03:30.206
given a short time, about two days to remember. The 
names of our. Organization upperclassmen. After

03:37.656 --> 03:38.818
the grace period. Should you not remember the 
upperclassmen name? He would spell it out on your

03:44.145 --> 03:46.969
butt. with one before board, which every 
upperclassman had at least one. This procedure

03:54.415 --> 04:02.368
was effective in name recall.

04:02.388 --> 04:13.345
Usually better study habits were formed

04:02.388 --> 04:13.345
early on in college and under this environment. 
They were always upperclassmen available for at

04:14.894 --> 04:22.323
least minor tutoring and other study help and 
advice. I am glad that I had the opportunity to go to

04:23.244 --> 04:28.230
A&M and be in the Corps of Cadets.

04:34.617 --> 04:43.888
After getting adjusted to college life my 
freshman year, I felt like I was ready to enter the

04:34.617 --> 04:43.888
School of Veterinary Medicine. Uh, with any 
without any apprehension. I was a little bit

04:49.788 --> 05:02.599
surprised and that anatomy and physiology were so 
difficult.

05:02.619 --> 05:04.521
But managed to survive. I had to study hard. But got 
by and stayed in school. Had some great teachers

05:11.067 --> 05:13.369
during those years. to name a few, Dr. Lang, Eads, 
Burns, Leonard, Dunn, Miliff, Armstead, and

05:15.172 --> 05:25.343
Turk, to name a few. I got by those three years in 
pretty good shape, and at the end of the spring 42

05:27.425 --> 05:45.043
semesters, I had received a ROTC infantry 
commission,

05:47.386 --> 05:50.430
And reported for active duty a few weeks later. At 
Camp Walters near Middle Wells, TX. An infantry

05:54.976 --> 05:56.778
replacement training center. I have trained 
bases there for six months. I was then transferred

06:01.384 --> 06:03.307
to Puerto Rico. Arriving there 3rd January 43. And 
assigned to infantry troops there. Didn't make it

06:12.559 --> 06:14.001
back to the. The States until April 6th, 46 without 
firing a shot for record.

06:24.124 --> 06:24.444
After. Receiving my discharge at Fort Sam. I 
joined my parents at home. And stayed. Until. June

06:38.400 --> 06:38.960
of 40. 6

06:38.980 --> 06:44.106
and return. to A&M to complete my last two 
semesters in the School of Veterinary Medicine.

06:56.173 --> 07:01.181
I was surprised to see so many of my old profs still 
around. Also, there were many of my former

07:03.725 --> 07:11.157
classmates and friends back to finish their 
formal education.

07:15.355 --> 07:20.902
Time passed in a hurry and graduation was at hand. 
The last week of the semester was a busy one. We took

07:28.471 --> 07:35.139
some final examinations, the state board, and 
attended a TVMA convention in Houston.

07:38.843 --> 07:41.967
I skipped graduation ceremonies and headed for 
home. My license and diploma caught up with me

07:44.971 --> 07:47.674
later.

07:53.381 --> 08:00.269
I found a temporary job in Abilene at a mixed 
practice.

08:06.757 --> 08:13.425
After spending six weeks in the mixed practice in 
Abilene, I accepted a job with Dr. U.E. Morney at

08:14.696 --> 08:18.262
the Alamo Dog and Cat Hospital in San Antonio. I 
reported for duty on March 12, 1947. One

08:24.132 --> 08:39.497
of my former classmates, Dr. Richard Culpepper, 
had been with Dr. Morney since late 1943.

08:45.991 --> 09:04.076
Dr. Morney was born November the 1st, 1882,

08:45.991 --> 09:04.076
grew up on a farm in Kansas, was graduated from 
Kansas City Veterinary College in 1912 at the age

08:45.991 --> 09:04.076
of 29. I'm not sure what his employment was 
immediately after graduation, but eventually

09:13.767 --> 09:20.557
became associated with a biological company that 
produced serums and Black Lake vaccines. About

09:22.100 --> 09:26.767
sometime in 1916.

09:29.150 --> 09:37.523
And he moved to San Antonio to establish a branch of 
his biological firm. And set up shop. At 1600

09:39.987 --> 09:42.070
Pleasanton Rd. This business later closed 
because of lack of revenue and Dr. Marnie ended up

09:44.834 --> 09:58.194
with the land and the buildings. He remodeled the 
buildings and established an exclusive small

09:59.055 --> 10:05.725
animal practice in 1922. Apparently the practice 
was an immediate success

10:15.277 --> 10:37.601
He had an ambulance service, hospital 
facilities, laboratory, and also he had an

10:15.277 --> 10:37.601
ambulance service that would pick up a small 
animal anywhere in the city for a small fee.

10:37.621 --> 10:43.427
He had an office hour from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a 
week. a staff available on Sundays and holidays

10:45.652 --> 10:56.388
for emergency,

10:45.652 --> 10:56.388
for emergency services. The practice remained a 
small animal only until the early 30s, and due to

10:57.410 --> 11:12.553
the depression economics, it became a mixed 
practice and remained So until the mid 50s. At that

11:18.685 --> 11:19.345
time. The practice again became small animal 
only.

11:28.994 --> 11:30.436
And talking to Richard before. Reporting for duty 
the first day.

11:39.804 --> 11:41.646
I learned that Doctor morning that not. Do any 
practice? Or any work of any kind. But be assured he

11:50.234 --> 11:52.077
knew what. What's going on around the practice? 
Miss Marty was in charge of the bookkeeping. And

12:01.330 --> 12:04.154
supervising supervise the office. In a highly 
efficient manner.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.565
The first morning on the job. About mid morning. I 
was being briefed in the business office. On

12:21.939 --> 12:27.084
office procedures when Doctor morning made his 
appearance.

12:30.648 --> 12:34.392
Is a. Attire was something I hadn't. Quite 
expected. He had owner. A gambler type celluloid

12:41.043 --> 12:43.546
visor. Addressed in pajamas. A bathrobe. And 
rubber boots. This is why this was his usual attire

12:53.296 --> 12:57.781
when he made his appearance.

13:00.584 --> 13:01.185
In the mornings. Sometimes he had substitute the. 
A long white lab coat for the bathrobe.

13:12.397 --> 13:23.852
To say that Dr. Morney was frugal

13:12.397 --> 13:23.852
would be the understatement of the century.

13:23.872 --> 13:29.319
A few times I've been with him in a cafe, he would 
order a child's plate. When refused, he may or may

13:30.240 --> 13:35.307
not order anything else. If he did order, he asked 
for separate checks He paid for his meal and I paid

13:40.510 --> 13:43.174
for mine.

13:46.378 --> 13:46.939
There were. Drugs. That he and supplies that he 
would not purchase. For the practice.

13:59.996 --> 14:06.504
His anesthetic of choices.

14:06.524 --> 14:09.268
Excuse me, his anesthetic of choice was. chloral 
hydrate or ether or chloroform. Take your pick.

14:20.647 --> 14:36.994
Richard and I purchased Nemitol, adhesive tape, 
splint supplies and numerous other items for use

14:20.647 --> 14:36.994
in the hospital out of our funds.

14:41.598 --> 14:41.958
He. He prepared his own small animal ration.

14:49.669 --> 14:51.411
Which consisted of fresh horse meat. Fresh 
vegetable. Such as cabbage, carrots, potatoes,

14:54.916 --> 14:58.641
spinach, lettuce and so forth. And wheat brand was 
added for book. One of the one of the employees was

15:05.070 --> 15:09.175
designated as chef. He prepared the ration by 
cutting up the ingredients, mixing, and cooking

15:10.437 --> 15:24.613
the mixture in an old-fashioned black wash pot on a 
wood fire. He made enough to last several days and

15:25.694 --> 15:33.102
stored it in a walk-in freezer.

15:36.046 --> 15:40.090
These were a few examples of Dr. Morningford's but 
he was not all bad. He had many good qualities. He

15:51.364 --> 15:59.491
was completely honest, a good citizen, and in his 
own way, a good professional person.

16:01.633 --> 16:08.760
He was very good to his veterinarian and backed him 
in every way he could.

16:12.368 --> 16:22.023
He belonged to the Veterinary Medical 
Association of Bexar County, TVMA, and the AVMA.

16:24.547 --> 16:36.606
He'd been president of the local association and 
TVMA and had served on numerous committees in the

16:24.547 --> 16:36.606
AVMA.

16:39.370 --> 16:40.452
He encouraged his his DVMs to become active in 
association affairs and pay their dues in the

16:41.225 --> 16:49.775
three associations.

16:53.400 --> 17:08.278
He attended many of the national association AVMA 
meetings, conventions, also most of the Texas

16:53.400 --> 17:08.278
meetings, and just about all of the Bexar County 
meetings.

17:17.830 --> 17:27.405
Sometime during the fall of 47, Dr. Morney 
informed Richard and I that he was planning on

17:17.830 --> 17:27.405
retiring at an early date. Should we be interested 
in purchasing the practice and all the property

17:28.567 --> 17:33.996
involved,

17:36.507 --> 17:43.038
So we indicated and he'd get back to us with a 
contract in a very short time. We told him we were

17:45.281 --> 17:49.809
interested and within a few days he had the 
contract.

17:54.957 --> 18:01.688
It seemed like the national debt to us at the time. 
But we realized it was a. It was very reasonable and

18:05.471 --> 18:07.974
so. We shook hands with him. And and made the deal. 
And on January the 1st of 48, Richard and I became

18:16.664 --> 18:31.202
the new owners of the Alamo Dog and Cat Cat Hospital 
and Doctor and Miss Morning finished moving to

18:16.664 --> 18:31.202
their home recently purchased in our 
neighborhood.

18:33.848 --> 18:39.773
He didn't stay away too long as he was back the next 
day for a visit.

18:44.518 --> 18:52.485
And it so happened that he was back each day for as 
long as he lived. That is each work day when he was in

18:55.047 --> 19:01.493
town.

19:15.007 --> 19:20.956
The 1959 AVM a convention was to be held in Kansas 
City, Missouri. And Doctor morning wasn't about

19:22.238 --> 19:28.707
to miss being there since it was close to his old 
Kansas home. And near his alma mater. The Kansas

19:32.372 --> 19:34.215
City Veterinary College. KCVC had been. Close. In 
1918. But there were a lot of his old classmates and

19:43.897 --> 19:50.684
friends still located nearby. And he was anxious 
to see him. He came by the hospital before he left.

20:03.177 --> 20:09.904
It was very evident that he wasn't feeling well. He 
admitted he was feeling punk, but as soon as he got

20:10.154 --> 20:15.059
on the road, he'd get on the road. Well, he'd he'd 
feel alright.

20:22.467 --> 20:28.313
He left San Antone the next day by car against the 
advice. Of his position.

20:34.439 --> 20:35.521
And against the wishes. Of mid morning. but he was 
intent on going and told her that he'd make it all

20:40.090 --> 20:47.439
right. By the time they arrived in Kansas City and 
checked in a hotel,

20:48.621 --> 21:05.703
his condition had worsened and it was termed very 
serious. After a brief exam, by the hotel

21:09.166 --> 21:10.527
physician. He was sent by ambulance to Kansas City 
Hospital. Where diffused peritonitis was

21:18.674 --> 21:23.238
diagnosed. And. Was caused by duodenal. Ruptured 
ulcer.

21:32.566 --> 21:35.369
Exploratory surgery was performed.

21:38.311 --> 21:39.072
At once. But to no avail as he died. 24 hours later. 
Post surgery.

21:52.411 --> 21:53.292
He was returned. Home.

21:58.319 --> 21:59.440
He had an appropriate. Funeral.

22:04.026 --> 22:05.769
In his church. The Holland L Baptist Church.

22:10.945 --> 22:19.076
He had 8

22:10.945 --> 22:19.076
pallbearers, all veterinarians.

22:22.361 --> 22:24.443
His funeral was well attended.

22:27.788 --> 22:28.729
And with. Many veterinarians in attendance.

22:34.958 --> 22:37.982
He was buried at in Mission Park South. which is 2 
1⁄2 miles from the hospital, veterinary

22:38.941 --> 22:48.271
hospital, that he loves so well. The inscription 
on his grave marker reads as simple, Erd Eli

22:48.291 --> 23:08.593
Morney, DVM, November 1, 1882, dash 8, or beg your 
pardon, August 24. 1959. He is

23:12.498 --> 23:27.799
still being missed.

23:27.819 --> 23:28.921
Dr Gerald Parker. A former classmate of ours. 
Joined our partnership. And practice. In October

23:36.492 --> 23:38.074
of 48.

23:41.834 --> 23:48.604
He brought with him some much needed professional 
help, expertise and stability. With him in the

23:50.167 --> 23:56.817
partnership, we were able to expand our 
professional operations. Also, we were able to

23:57.578 --> 24:03.146
pay Dr. Morney off in six and a half years after we 
took over.

24:07.813 --> 24:11.098
In the latter part of May 64, The partnership 
purchased the Highland Animal Hospital. I was

24:17.075 --> 24:19.698
designated to operate the hospital. We moved in 
June 1, 64, and took over the practice. We sold the

24:27.429 --> 24:35.119
practice to the new owner, and he took over 
February 1, 86. I retired from active practice on

24:35.339 --> 24:39.465
that date. In 1967, the partnership built the 
Colony North Animal Hospital. Dr. Richard opened

24:47.631 --> 24:52.516
the practice in late 67. He had had a heart attack in 
64 but recovered well and was able to be back on duty

24:53.837 --> 25:02.426
in about two months. He did well until late 69. His 
condition worsened and he had his second heart

25:07.471 --> 25:11.055
attack. Had a very slow recovery time. Should not 
have been back. To work. But insisted. That he

25:21.835 --> 25:24.539
worked. He had his third and last heart attack in 
the early morning hours and died on May. 15th at

25:33.030 --> 25:34.552
home.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.481
His funeral was held in his Episcopal Church. To a 
standing room only clock crowd. With just about

25:46.208 --> 25:49.774
ever DVM in the city attended. His. Passing was a 
great blow to all of us. He had, but he had the

25:56.645 --> 26:02.354
hospital affairs in good order, which made the 
transition. An easy one. One of our associates was

26:05.759 --> 26:10.607
designated to operate. The hospital until Gerald 
could take over. In October. Oh 72. Gerald still

26:20.573 --> 26:28.880
operating the hospital at this time, but the time 
doctor that lofts. A special kind of doctor is

26:28.900 --> 26:32.063
published. He should be well retired. Someone. 
Should give him a. A medal. or some kind of award for

26:42.886 --> 26:48.299
putting up with me these 42 years.

26:53.051 --> 26:55.217
This concludes my part of the dissertation. Thank 
you.

27:14.915 --> 27:18.239
Also, I would taken a course in speaking. Into a 
cassette recorder.

27:29.651 --> 27:31.033
But I enjoyed reflecting. All my association with 
Doctor Morney. He was truly. A unique individual.

27:43.486 --> 27:44.888
There was only one pattern. And there's

27:47.348 --> 27:54.658
never been another liking.
