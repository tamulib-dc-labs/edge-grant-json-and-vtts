00:02.815 --> 00:08.501
I was starting to ask, what are the, what 
contributes to Aggie spirit? This feeling of

00:09.643 --> 00:21.055
warmth and affection and respect that so many 
people, students, faculty, staff, and others

00:09.643 --> 00:21.055
have in school. What is it that builds that?

00:26.762 --> 00:29.785
I think that in my own instance, I think it was the 
core of cadets. I remember that it became apparent

00:36.222 --> 00:58.145
to me that, and I was also brought to my attention 
several times, that you are not important as C

00:36.222 --> 00:58.145
Company infantry. The important thing is see 
infantry, what it is like, what it does. And you

01:06.861 --> 01:21.768
have an obligation to know every man in the 
company, which as a freshman I proceeded to

01:06.861 --> 01:21.768
memorize the names of every person and their 
hometown. If you didn't If you couldn't give the

01:25.013 --> 01:38.754
hometown, you might have it spelled out in a very 
emphatic manner.

01:39.856 --> 01:48.849
Also, you know, I worried about this at first, 
Haskell, because it seemed like you were

01:39.856 --> 01:48.849
criticized everything you did. And I was getting 
very discouraged. And then I was surprised to find

01:54.241 --> 02:04.410
out by watching that this sophomore said that to 
everyone. So then I began to get the feel of this

02:04.430 --> 02:07.633
thing. It was a learning to live together and to 
make your contribution. Now, also, you did not

02:16.662 --> 02:21.126
have to like someone. You simply needed to know how 
to work with someone and to

02:21.595 --> 02:39.953
be courteous, even though you didn't like the 
language of the person. Well, all right, but you

02:39.973 --> 02:50.083
accept the man as being a part of your unit. We did 
things together. And I noticed that today, out on

02:54.179 --> 03:06.597
the campus, they have tremendous organization 
that you can belong to. But it is, and also,

03:06.617 --> 03:13.927
Haskell, we took care of each other.

03:15.810 --> 03:19.395
I noticed this when I was director of the 
counseling center. If you have someone in your

03:20.202 --> 03:32.775
dormitory that obviously is sick, you see that 
they get to the hospital. All right, now I was going

03:32.795 --> 03:38.481
to say, you were saying that for you it was the core. 
But later, in the 50s, 60s, 70s, you as a

03:39.462 --> 03:49.973
professional must have seen this transcend the 
core because there were so many who were not in it.

03:51.033 --> 03:56.000
And so that had to be greater. I had a grandson who 
came here in 1988. It was a history maybe. Tim. Tim

04:05.113 --> 04:07.736
lived in Puryear Hall. Now Puryear Hall was not 
what I used to call non-reg. But they had their own

04:14.346 --> 04:17.911
organization. They had certain leaders that were 
designated. And they did things together. One of

04:27.272 --> 04:36.180
the things that also contributes to this over the 
years has been the intramural program. We have for

04:36.260 --> 04:43.587
many years, to my knowledge, had the most 
extensive intramural program in the United

04:36.260 --> 04:43.587
States. Well, that puts young men, they run 
together, they play together, And this builds up a

04:50.770 --> 04:55.819
unity. And it

04:55.839 --> 05:02.611
has tradition. Now some profs come down here from 
east or west or somewhere, and that's the first

05:03.353 --> 05:14.533
thing they want to eliminate, are the traditions. 
Well, my experience has been that if you have that

05:15.509 --> 05:23.738
faculty member stay five, six, seven years, he 
begins to change. So Haskell, whatever it is, eats

05:25.340 --> 05:34.650
on the professor just as it does on the student. I 
think it's a wonderful thing. In this

05:38.434 --> 05:41.297
inclusiveness,

05:44.568 --> 05:54.580
How much did it matter about the students' family 
wealth, ancestry, national background, et

05:44.568 --> 05:54.580
cetera? Oh, that's an interesting point. I don't 
think it makes any. I sensed this the first week I

06:00.146 --> 06:03.470
was here. It's remarkable. And it was even so that I 
had some friends who were very well-off. But you

06:14.470 --> 06:19.457
would never know it, because we all did things 
together. No one tried to show off with this, that,

06:20.378 --> 06:23.623
or the other. I think that

06:25.406 --> 06:43.752
if some way they could devise a method to allow a 
student to retain his heritage, retain his

06:25.406 --> 06:43.752
characteristics, but learn to live with others 
and go ahead with your, well, your interests. I was

06:55.394 --> 07:04.548
flabbergasted here a few weeks ago to see over 
television. This is at the University of

07:04.728 --> 07:08.494
Virginia. I was only on the campus of the 
University of Virginia for two days. and I was

07:12.841 --> 07:16.766
deeply impressed with their honor system. This 
was related to the black students and this fellow

07:18.429 --> 07:39.017
who was interviewing them was thrown completely 
off balance because

07:18.429 --> 07:39.017
they said we want what our rights are as it relates 
to the functioning of living, getting

07:39.250 --> 07:49.225
instruction, but we want to be with our own. And 
they had their own tables at the dining hall. They

07:56.116 --> 08:00.803
said, we feel more comfortable this way. And they 
in effect were saying, I'm not eating to win

08:01.154 --> 08:10.825
friends and influence people. I'm eating because 
I'm with people that I am like.

08:22.879 --> 08:25.342
We can live together. We can work together. The 
military does this. I mean, when you get into the

08:29.563 --> 08:41.864
Navy or whatever it is, you have strong 
differences, but there are times when it's time to

08:29.563 --> 08:41.864
put it all together. To me, one of A&N's many 
strengths is that okay, so you grew up in the

08:48.522 --> 08:51.627
country and I didn't, so what? Or, so you happen to 
be Germanic in ancestry and I happen to be Dutch, so

08:52.368 --> 08:58.537
what? Let's see if we can work this math problem 
together, or let's see if we can share whatever

08:59.739 --> 09:05.728
else. And it was this inclusiveness, which... 
that if you're an Aggie, that's all that matters,

09:11.810 --> 09:15.275
if you're one of us. And if you're not, then the old 
thing of highway six runs both ways was the answer.

09:21.383 --> 09:23.947
If you don't like it, well, keep going. All right. 
Or within the Corps or without of the Corps, are

09:26.651 --> 09:40.770
there certain events where people share the 
experience that you think helped to pull Aggies

09:41.290 --> 09:43.995
together? Well, I feel that one thing, it's 
interesting. We have all the differences in the

09:51.068 --> 10:01.847
world, but when we get out on Kyle Field and we're 
playing football, for example, the people They

10:02.198 --> 10:04.562
are together. Even the alumni. There's a 
commonality. And it's remarkable. People are

10:14.097 --> 10:20.787
flabbergasted at how many people attend Ireland. 
What about, have you got a time commitment? No, no,

10:25.114 --> 10:30.282
but Melba wants us to take a break.

10:34.514 --> 10:36.837
Let's jump to 1970. Mr.

10:36.857 --> 10:43.347
Rutter dies early that year. Jack Williams comes 
November the 1st. Do you remember your first

10:48.534 --> 10:50.998
impressions of him? Well, yes, I do. But I think I 
may have commented on this. My first meeting with

10:59.438 --> 11:13.858
President Wheeler was the, he asked that we come 
down to his office, Jack Dobson, director of the

10:59.438 --> 11:13.858
A&M adjunct. Myself, who was the administrative 
person that, well, would answer to you or to a

11:14.819 --> 11:27.977
proper person as to how the program was doing and 
all that sort of thing. And then we took Dean

11:28.750 --> 11:37.585
Maxwell with us because the courses tended to be in 
his college. And Maxwell didn't have much to say

11:37.605 --> 11:47.181
until we were walking and got about halfway down to 
the system building and he said,

11:51.025 --> 11:54.069
President Williams, but he said, I don't know why 
you're doing it. He said the A&M adjunct has been

11:54.089 --> 12:06.686
given to Texas Tech and they're going to take over 
the first of June. Well, we had about almost

12:07.927 --> 12:20.644
filled for the first six weeks and a great number 
for the second six weeks. And it was a very awkward

12:25.685 --> 12:28.612
situation. Well, we got to President Williams' 
office and he commented that he was interested in

12:28.772 --> 12:40.540
the program. And we faced this issue then, what are 
we going to do? We have all these people who have

12:49.057 --> 12:52.021
sent their money in. And President Williams 
called in Bob Cherry, the secretary, to the board.

13:00.914 --> 13:07.944
And Bob explained that that had been worked out by 
tech. And that was what they had said they wanted to

13:08.105 --> 13:11.269
do. But they also though recognized the dilemma 
and they had a telephone meeting of the board and

13:12.295 --> 13:29.636
changed the closing date to the 1st of September.

13:30.477 --> 13:34.561
President Williams was, he asked a lot of 
questions. He was very much at ease, very

13:35.923 --> 13:41.830
interested in the program. And I

13:42.620 --> 13:53.849
felt that we had a very competent man here.

13:55.491 --> 14:05.079
I was the university's representative to the 
college board. Bob Logan was the second one

14:05.499 --> 14:12.205
because of his scholarships and loans. We

14:12.522 --> 14:23.396
tried to keep President Williams informed, and I 
think we did. But I had this experience with

14:23.416 --> 14:27.101
President Williams. He wrote me and said, I want 
you to write me a letter explaining how you feel

14:27.181 --> 14:40.538
about the

14:27.181 --> 14:40.538
scholarship program where it is restricted 
completely with financial need and

14:40.788 --> 14:51.620
is that the best way for us to go? Well, of course, 
under Bob Logan's leadership, the president's

14:52.140 --> 15:07.116
scholars were chosen basically on potential and 
what they demonstrated they had done. And I backed

15:07.484 --> 15:09.546
this. I think that there are other ways they could 
have designated those loans to people who were in

15:10.647 --> 15:18.734
need. But I hesitated at the word scholarship. But 
I got this letter from President Williams who

15:25.900 --> 15:31.084
said, please write me this. So I wrote back and 
said, Mr. Bob Logan, who heads up this work in the

15:36.948 --> 15:43.415
scholarships and loans, much better qualified 
than I. And I

15:44.115 --> 15:52.764
did not want to presume on Bob Logan's field. Well, 
I sent the letter. Well, in about three days, I got

15:57.549 --> 16:00.813
this letter back. And he said, I'm well acquainted 
with Mr. Bob Logan and his work. But he said, that is

16:06.783 --> 16:09.326
not what I asked you. I asked you to tell me what you 
thought. And he said, I persist that you write me

16:15.013 --> 16:19.259
this letter. Well, I did. I did. And I frankly think 
that President Williams had somewhat the same

16:22.503 --> 16:30.373
feelings. I know Wayne Hall backed me on this. 
Well,

16:37.327 --> 16:49.867
President Williams,

16:37.327 --> 16:49.867
later, he was on the board of the college entrance 
examination board. And I felt a little

16:49.887 --> 17:03.469
awkwardness about the president of the 
university

17:04.428 --> 17:07.072
Well, Haskell, I didn't know how to handle it. It's 
kind of like a sergeant visiting with a major. But,

17:13.602 --> 17:17.027
you know, I think he knew that. And he's a great 
tease, you know. But I saw him later, after he left.

17:27.522 --> 17:29.786
I think he went to Houston. Mm-hmm. And he had come 
for some reason to a College Board meeting in San

17:30.736 --> 17:41.570
Antonio and he grabbed me and he was a very warm 
person. But I would imagine that if you

17:42.391 --> 17:56.929
lollygagged around or you pulled some stupid 
stunt, it would be an entirely different

17:42.391 --> 17:56.929
relationship. Soon after he got here, Horace 
Byers retired and John Calhoun became the new

17:57.162 --> 18:07.214
chief academic officer. Describe any 
interaction you had with him and any evaluation

18:07.354 --> 18:13.502
you had with him. Well, you know, with Dr. Byers? 
No, well, Byers and then Calhoun. Well, there was

18:21.171 --> 18:24.655
an interesting thing that happened about that. 
Dr. Byers admitted to me, he said, I may have made an

18:25.765 --> 18:43.224
error in judgment there, and I should have had your 
center as one of the places that Dr. Calhoun would

18:25.765 --> 18:43.224
be taken and given an orientation. And he said, I'm 
sorry, but I didn't make any mention. Well, my

18:50.132 --> 18:55.738
feeling was that Dr. Calhoun really didn't know 
may not have known that this organization was

18:55.988 --> 19:00.515
under him. And I want to tell you that one of the most 
pleasant interviews I've had was the day you came

19:01.977 --> 19:14.237
by. And you told me, I knew you, but you told me what 
your relationship was and some things about could

19:23.478 --> 19:29.026
you do this and could you do that. And for the first 
time, I felt that I had an academic person who

19:29.727 --> 19:45.691
understood what we were trying to do in the field of 
dialogue. And Haskell, that was a warm feeling.

19:49.436 --> 19:50.818
Now in those years, in the Williams-Calhoun 
years, the counseling, was it counseling and

19:51.811 --> 19:58.237
testing? What was the center called? It was called 
the Academic Counseling Center. Academic

20:04.703 --> 20:06.005
Counseling Center. It reported to whom in those 
years? To Dr. Barr. But directly to him? Yes. Okay,

20:14.873 --> 20:15.734
all right. And then under Calhoun, same way? Yes, 
sir. Okay. Mm-hmm. And the staff, by and large,

20:19.199 --> 20:23.446
included whom in that period of time? In that 
period of time,

20:23.546 --> 20:32.159
there was myself and Dr. Hope. But Dr. Hope, 
though, was later taken by Dean Huber as associate

20:32.680 --> 20:39.150
dean. And Dr. Sarah Jones took over. and was a very 
capable clinical psychologist. Very, very

20:49.217 --> 20:52.160
capable. Had Ulrich Kroll. We had this young man, 
Ronald Lewis, who got his PhD, and he now has his own

20:54.242 --> 21:06.995
counseling center out away from the university. 
He's done quite well.

21:11.917 --> 21:16.142
We had a small staff, to be honest with you. I 
sometimes wonder how in the world we got to work

21:17.664 --> 21:21.729
that. Share with this record, what was a typical 
day's effort like? What did day in and day out, what

21:31.501 --> 21:36.507
did the center do? One of the things that I tried to 
do was to gear our work in such a way that there would

21:36.824 --> 21:54.219
be periods when we would emphasize certain 
things. Like in the summer months would be

21:54.539 --> 22:05.869
bringing

21:54.539 --> 22:05.869
in the small groups of students, processing them, 
and getting them out. Now, of course, when we open

22:06.119 --> 22:15.551
school, then we could put our energy into a 
different activity. And that would be, say,

22:15.571 --> 22:20.317
academic counseling.

22:22.900 --> 22:34.675
As

22:22.900 --> 22:34.675
we got into the fall, then there would be the 
problems of...

22:36.916 --> 22:41.943
Well, we did a lot of vocational counseling. And it 
was a good contribution. People like Dr. Howard

22:46.729 --> 22:50.134
Gravitt. Dr. Gravitt kept a very close eye on his 
pre-meds and pre-dental students. If in the

22:57.003 --> 23:04.813
sophomore year they were having difficulty, then 
Dr. Gravitt would arrange for the student to come

23:05.317 --> 23:08.040
over to us. And we would try to answer what are the 
causing, what's causing these things. We, in many

23:17.031 --> 23:32.270
instances, we were able to divert the student into 
choosing a field related to the medical field, but

23:17.031 --> 23:32.270
not the doctor of medicine. Bob Cochran, Dr. 
Cochran was a person who kept a close eye on his

23:35.523 --> 23:41.689
nuclear engineering student. If it appeared in 
the sophomore year that they were not handling the

23:41.709 --> 23:53.642
background work, then Dr. Cochran would call me 
and send the student over. Well, when these things

23:54.482 --> 24:03.792
happened, we simply tried to help the student look 
at the options. and to have them choose. As far as

24:06.986 --> 24:24.925
Dr. Gravitt or Dr. Cochran was concerned, we tried 
to write them a letter which would answer these

24:06.986 --> 24:24.925
questions, but would not

24:06.986 --> 24:24.925
break the confidence thing. We also, we served in 
institutional research Actually, when that

24:34.653 --> 24:41.360
concept first came out, no one in the college 
wanted it. And they'd send the material to the

24:42.121 --> 24:46.585
counseling center. And Lannis Hope did a lot of 
work on that. We tried to keep our college's, our

24:51.650 --> 25:00.019
university's image with those college 
universities over the country that were doing

25:00.860 --> 25:06.806
institutional research. We did some 
institutional research. We did, we couldn't do a

25:10.690 --> 25:27.407
whole lot, but we did enough that it was, 
correlation studies would be helpful in planning

25:10.690 --> 25:27.407
what is to be done. Also, Dr. Wayne Hall called me 
over and said, Austin, we are not getting a good

25:28.265 --> 25:45.969
measure of the quality of our product. And I want 
you to come up with something that will make it

25:45.989 --> 25:52.838
possible for us to make some judgments. So I 
thought about it, I read, I looked around, and I

25:54.370 --> 26:14.329
found that the graduate record examinations had 
an advanced test, and that you could rent old

25:54.370 --> 26:14.329
copies of that.

26:18.032 --> 26:22.977
So we tried this out, we gave the students the test. 
And we were really surprised at the relationship

26:26.631 --> 26:38.790
between the test and the program that they were 
going through. So I suggested to Dr. Hall that we

26:39.591 --> 26:51.850
add the GRE aptitude test and the appropriate 
advanced tests to the testing program of

26:52.758 --> 27:00.487
graduating seniors. Dr. Hall said, well, we'll 
have to handle that carefully. And what we did was

27:09.918 --> 27:16.285
we told the seniors that this is a requirement for 
graduation. Texas A&M University will pay for it.

27:24.001 --> 27:25.403
It will not cost you anything. You may have the 
scores for your own personal use. And we pointed

27:31.429 --> 27:43.403
out that in some instances, the GRE test could be 
used in lieu of the civil service examination. We

27:44.159 --> 27:47.063
had resistance. Students like to resist. But we 
were all capable people. And we handled that all

27:56.217 --> 27:57.839
right. Did you find a correlation between the 
grades they had earned, their general grade

27:58.560 --> 28:10.878
average, and the GRE? Yes. We found some 
stimulating things. By the way, there was a,

28:15.944 --> 28:28.459
I think that Bill Carter, one of our graduate 
students, wrote his dissertation on this. What we

28:29.721 --> 28:40.795
found was that, first, we were a much stronger 
university in terms of our product than we had

28:29.721 --> 28:40.795
imagined. We're using a thousand as the base for 
graduate study. Half of the graduating class of

28:51.222 --> 29:01.775
Texas A&M University would be eligible for 
graduate study to first class places. Then we took

29:01.795 --> 29:10.647
the advanced test and we got normative data on 
those tests from the GRE people. And for instance,

29:11.538 --> 29:30.322
in biology,

29:11.538 --> 29:30.322
the mean score for our students would put them in 
the 84th percentile of the national. Very good.

29:32.184 --> 29:32.745
Very good. Economics was the same way. 
Engineering did well. Now math, math did not. So

29:44.835 --> 29:50.965
Wayne Hall says, we've got to find out why. So he 
calls in from Baton Rouge, I believe, a fellow who

29:50.985 --> 30:02.303
was recognized in his field of math teaching. And 
he stayed with us two days. And he said, well,

30:06.938 --> 30:09.661
Rennie, you're not in as bad a shape as it appears. 
He said, first, you do not have a thorough

30:09.681 --> 30:20.014
undergraduate program of math for math majors. 
You're spending all your time as subsidiary

30:21.616 --> 30:28.744
courses for other colleges. He said also you must 
strengthen your math courses in the

30:30.192 --> 30:46.709
undergraduate program because the students must 
have material that will give them that

30:30.192 --> 30:46.709
background. So the math department went to work. I 
want to point out here is that in all of my work I

30:51.754 --> 30:58.461
tried to place it in such a way that the faculty 
would use it. I was not telling them what to do. It

31:08.949 --> 31:12.215
was to give them information. For instance, when 
we were considering these things, we had every

31:12.235 --> 31:24.195
department on the campus send three professors 
over. And they sat in the room we set up for this. And

31:29.908 --> 31:32.232
they studied the test thoroughly. And they made 
the decision whether or not
