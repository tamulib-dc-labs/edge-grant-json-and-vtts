00:02.410 --> 00:10.402
I've always been a leader from my contemporaries,

00:02.410 --> 00:10.402
except two years at A&M. I can't remember any 
leadership I did there. Okay, now of course you

00:13.366 --> 00:32.113
were in the military for three decades, and I was 
wondering, you must have met a lot of officers who

00:13.366 --> 00:32.113
were A&M graduates, and a lot of officers who were 
West Point graduates, and some were ROTC men. And I

00:32.583 --> 00:37.432
was wondering if you could tell me the difference 
between those types. Well, I found quite a bit of

00:37.673 --> 00:50.858
difference when I was a flying instructor and in 
charge of primary flying stage at Brooks Field.

00:54.265 --> 00:55.367
I found that the young man who came from ROTC, A&M, 
Georgia Tech, and various other places, took to

00:57.828 --> 01:14.985
flying better than the graduates of West Point. 
And I figured it out, it was because Their mind

01:18.466 --> 01:29.465
hadn't been grooved along a certain line like they 
do at West Point at that time back in the 20's. I

01:29.485 --> 01:42.988
think the West Point cadets were more or less put in 
a rut if you can put a youngster in a rut like that

01:29.485 --> 01:42.988
early in their thinking. It made it a little more 
difficult for them to learn to fly than the A&M

01:43.846 --> 01:59.167
cadets and ROTC from the other universities. I 
never noticed any difference between A&M cadets

01:59.187 --> 02:09.381
and Georgia Tech, for instance, or the various 
other ROTC units. Do you think that any of them

02:10.154 --> 02:17.667
officers, when they became officers, do you think 
that they were well trained? Yes, I think they

02:17.948 --> 02:27.705
were,

02:17.948 --> 02:27.705
I think they were as good as West Point officers.

02:30.710 --> 02:34.457
Better in some respects, possibly not quite as 
good as others, but I couldn't point out the

02:35.163 --> 02:52.099
differences and then of course each one is an 
individual and you can't classify a

02:35.163 --> 02:52.099
bunch of people because everyone's different.

02:52.119 --> 03:02.689
But I was very proud of the A&M officers that I had 
under me and I knew

03:05.723 --> 03:07.385
I was always proud of A&M. Had a reputation 
throughout the Army of turning out fine officers.

03:21.519 --> 03:22.961
I had some of them as cadets.

03:27.165 --> 03:34.853
George Epright

03:27.165 --> 03:34.853
lived over there by Austin, was one of my students. 
He came from A&M. He's since given A&M a very large

03:39.367 --> 03:46.760
donation of land out of the land. He was probably 
the best student I ever had. He was from A&M.

03:57.878 --> 03:58.900
Best flying student. When you were at A&M, would 
you consider yourself an average student? As far

04:05.673 --> 04:21.293
as students go, I was probably average.

04:21.695 --> 04:31.289
talk to people about A&M, a number of them say that 
it's more than just a college, more than just an

04:21.695 --> 04:31.289
institution, but there's something special. 
Would you agree with that, or what are your

04:31.309 --> 04:34.393
thoughts on that? I think there's something 
special about Texas A&M that just breeds better

04:34.413 --> 04:49.575
class of citizens, better army officers, better 
big civil life. There's something about the

04:50.888 --> 05:12.528
atmosphere there that, among the core, of course, 
it stressed discipline and integrity and

04:50.888 --> 05:12.528
honesty.

05:12.548 --> 05:14.972
The other students now, I don't know much about. 
The Corps is probably only about 10% of the, is it?

05:20.792 --> 05:24.699
About 10% of them.

05:24.719 --> 05:30.809
So I suppose that the other 90% are about the same as 
the Texas University. I mean, they're the schools

05:30.829 --> 05:37.740
in Texas.

05:37.760 --> 05:42.107
I think Texans are superior to them. residents of 
any other state. Why do you say that? I think

05:53.182 --> 05:57.627
straighter,

05:53.182 --> 05:57.627
more patriotism.

06:04.033 --> 06:12.162
Something about the Alamo law and something about 
Texas that makes you proud of it. If you take pride

06:13.103 --> 06:21.237
in your state, then you can take pride in your 
country.

06:21.257 --> 06:25.143
Were you sad when you left Texas A&M in 1917? What's 
that? Were you sad when you left A&M? Did you want to

06:28.769 --> 06:29.731
come back? Why did you leave? Well, I left to help 
Dad on the ranch. He couldn't hire anybody. He was

06:37.905 --> 06:39.347
out there by himself.

06:43.327 --> 06:47.752
And when I left, I had no idea what I was going to do, 
whether I was going to come back or not. And the war

06:48.593 --> 06:50.194
had just started. The war had just started, yeah. 
And about August, I tried to enlist in the Marines,

06:53.258 --> 07:05.010
and they were pulled up, and that's why I put in this 
newfangledness of flying. It

07:06.011 --> 07:11.157
would be a challenge to me. So about four or five 
months later before I was able to get in. Because

07:19.475 --> 07:20.556
they were killed too? Were they killed? Yeah, they 
didn't have any place.

07:28.546 --> 07:35.575
They enlisted me, but I was on standby status until 
December. I had a cousin who was a general in the

07:36.365 --> 07:44.237
army and I wrote him to see if he could. He was a what? 
A general? Yeah, General Fletcher Sharp. How'd

07:49.285 --> 07:50.948
you meet him? Well, he was my cousin.

08:00.082 --> 08:02.305
I wrote him.

08:03.888 --> 08:06.832
capture a door in the Philippines with 
Wainwright. He and Wainwright were in the same

08:06.892 --> 08:09.576
prison camp. He

08:09.656 --> 08:14.122
uh, he wrote back. I

08:15.424 --> 08:24.878
think maybe he helped me get in, and I finally got in 
in December. Went to Austin to ground school.

08:34.448 --> 08:40.119
I've got a letter here from...

08:40.680 --> 08:42.523
I'll turn that light on. There's two outlets 
there. I don't know why she took them both.

09:04.705 --> 09:05.806
I got it. Okay. I got a letter here from the United 
States Air Force, research on military

09:06.707 --> 09:21.965
leadership and it's written by Captain Puryear 
and this is back in 1961.

09:25.269 --> 09:31.877
He asked certain questions here and I wrote the 
answers down.

09:32.887 --> 09:48.867
Unfortunately, it didn't keep the question, but I 
think if you look at the answers I have here on

09:32.887 --> 09:48.867
leadership, it might give you some insight into

09:32.887 --> 09:48.867
my thinking on it. Let's talk about your career. 
Yeah. And anything that, of course, you've

09:52.571 --> 10:02.083
written in your memoirs, which you're going to 
give us a copy of, anything that you've written,

10:02.570 --> 10:06.476
You can just say that's in my memoirs and we can move 
on. But otherwise, I would like to get an idea of

10:07.317 --> 10:15.329
your career. Well, it's all written down in my 
memoirs.

10:32.152 --> 11:00.201
1919, I was stationed at Carl Field, Wichita 
Falls, Texas, and an old schoolmate of mine, Bill

10:32.152 --> 11:00.201
Irwin, came through with a flying circus, and he 
wanted to know why I was still in the Army, why I

10:32.152 --> 11:00.201
couldn't get out and make a fortune flying in one of 
these, with his circus, taking up passengers, and

10:32.152 --> 11:00.201
they'd pay him so much for or

11:01.565 --> 11:08.233
pairing at various functions. So I decided I'd get 
out of the Army and be a barnstormer. So I put in and I

11:15.222 --> 11:17.845
couldn't get out until October. That's as soon as 
they let me loose of 1919 and by that time Bill Irwin

11:18.586 --> 11:27.117
had lost his life on the Dole flight.

11:29.459 --> 11:32.023
trying to fly to Hawaii. It was a $25,000 prize for 
the first one who flew from the mainland

11:32.043 --> 11:41.518
over to Hawaii. And he was at the Blanca, I believe, 
in an airplane. He started out with a mechanic and

11:45.645 --> 11:52.075
never was heard from again. There I was out of the 
Army and no job, but that didn't bother me any. I

11:58.663 --> 12:11.026
went down to Dallas,

11:58.663 --> 12:11.026
stayed with some friends there, and a fella hired 
me to buy an airplane for him. He wanted to go out and

12:11.146 --> 12:17.978
take up passengers, a $10 ride, wanted me to fly a 
plane.

12:20.185 --> 12:22.008
that's all covered in the memoirs. Well, I was 
wondering about World War I and about your

12:22.348 --> 12:26.934
training. Oh,

12:26.954 --> 12:47.343
well after eight weeks at ground school in Austin, 
Texas, there was no Vegans in the flying school for

12:26.954 --> 12:47.343
us, so they sent us all to Camp Deck at Dallas, 
Texas, which was

12:26.954 --> 12:47.343
in the fairgrounds at Dallas. We were quartered in 
the in the building that normally housed the

12:50.847 --> 13:03.344
animals,

12:50.847 --> 13:03.344
waiting vacancies in flying school.

13:03.364 --> 13:05.566
And I've got that all covered in my memoirs. In my 
flying school, I went to Kelly,

13:07.048 --> 13:15.359
and I went over to Brookston to take an 
instructor's course. I went out to Georgia to be an

13:15.520 --> 13:19.605
instructor, a flying instructor. How good was the 
quality of instruction when they taught you how to

13:19.957 --> 13:25.964
fly? It was exceptionally good at Kelly. At that 
time, I started April 6, 1918,

13:29.589 --> 13:48.411
and we had the old Jennys, JN-4Ds, Curtis JN-4Ds, 
and I had a man named Chandler who was my instructor

13:29.589 --> 13:48.411
for a duo.

13:52.373 --> 13:57.498
I think he was a very fine instructor, and I think 
the quality of instruction was very good.

14:00.321 --> 14:03.363
Were there any fatalities, any problems? Well, a 
lot of cadets were killed, some instructors. I had

14:09.189 --> 14:14.194
Eddie Stinson, who was a well-known aviator at 
that time. He was an instructor at Kelly. Joe

14:18.297 --> 14:20.980
Levery died recently. I lived in San Antonio. He 
was an acrobatic instructor. I had the cream of the

14:28.245 --> 14:31.749
crop as far as instructors go. What was the 
feeling? Was the feeling that you were in a brand

14:32.690 --> 14:36.555
new field now? Was it exciting? Do you

14:37.497 --> 14:42.203
remember? Well, I just remember I liked it. I loved 
it.

14:48.892 --> 14:49.212
It was exciting. I'm not philosophical about it in 
any way

14:50.255 --> 14:56.442
that I can remember. What did the other parts of the 
Army think about the Army Air Corps? Well, they

15:02.649 --> 15:06.894
were jealous of us.

15:06.914 --> 15:10.718
We wore white ribbons around our hats. You had 
these old campaign hats, you know, stick out and

15:10.818 --> 15:15.964
come to a point up here. And around the sweatband, 
We wore white ribbon to denote that we were cadets.

15:25.753 --> 15:29.758
We weren't enlisted men, we were cadets getting 
$75 a month. Enlisted men were getting $13, I

15:30.058 --> 15:33.923
think, maybe $20. We'd

15:35.925 --> 15:46.857
all go into town in San Antonio and meet the girls.

15:47.798 --> 15:53.164
So and so would say, well, tell the girls at that 
white hat band that we had venereal disease.

16:00.812 --> 16:01.573
And jealousy.

16:08.821 --> 16:10.583
But I think that's pretty well covered.

16:14.258 --> 16:21.626
And what campaigns, just briefly, what campaigns 
are, did you go, did they send you to France, or did

16:14.258 --> 16:21.626
you remain an instructor? No, they kept me in this 
country as an instructor, and I think if the war had

16:21.646 --> 16:40.986
lasted another year, I would have probably been 
stuck right in the United States as a flying

16:21.646 --> 16:40.986
instructor because I was very good at it, and that 
was the first day I went out to Southern Field. I was

16:41.006 --> 16:44.029
put in charge of a small group, I don't know why they 
picked me, but they did, to teach them what they

16:44.431 --> 16:59.950
would get when they got to Brooks Field and they 
were going to take the instructor's course.

17:04.155 --> 17:08.680
So that was the first day I was out there. I flew 
eight hours instructing these

17:15.346 --> 17:19.735
young lieutenants on what they were going to get 
when they got to Brooks Field.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.025
I started my leadership right there.

17:28.212 --> 17:35.346
But for the next, I didn't get in a position of 
leadership

17:28.212 --> 17:35.346
until

17:44.135 --> 17:56.567
I guess in 1926, when I was picked to be the head man 
at the primary flying stage at Brooks Field. I had

17:56.667 --> 18:01.532
21 instructors and 120 students under my command. 
That was my first big... Okay, but before we get

18:05.395 --> 18:11.121
there, why'd you decide to quit barnstorming? and 
when did you, and why did you decide to go back?

18:15.492 --> 18:23.859
Okay, so you got out of the service in 1919, and then 
you barnstormed, and how long did you do that, and

18:15.492 --> 18:23.859
why did you decide to go back in? Well, I gave up on 
this joker that hired me in Dallas. I gave up on him

18:30.445 --> 18:41.395
because I didn't like him, and we weren't making 
any money, and so I quit him after about a month. and

18:42.387 --> 18:45.611
I went back up to Dalhart to be with my folks for 
Christmas. And then I got a call from Amarillo, a

18:46.512 --> 18:58.527
fella I'd known at the Caulfield, and said, we want 
you down here in our new flying company. We're

18:58.567 --> 19:03.814
going to barnstorm all over the Panhandle. We got 
two airplanes. So I went down there and I was in the

19:05.376 --> 19:10.302
barnstorming business until about April and May. 
In the meantime, the War Department had written me

19:14.588 --> 19:21.594
a letter and went to Dalhart and my mother opened 
it. April and May of what year? 1920. And that's

19:27.539 --> 19:29.441
covered in my memoir. Sure. My mother called me up 
from Dalhart and said, son, there's a letter here

19:31.022 --> 19:37.708
from the War Department. They want you back in the 
Army. They would make you a first lieutenant. If

19:42.430 --> 19:52.863
you must fly, son, why don't you get back in the Army 
where you can fly some decent equipment instead of

19:42.430 --> 19:52.863
those old crates that you're flying down there on 
an armarella?" I said, okay mother. So I accepted

19:57.790 --> 20:00.793
it. I got back in the Army in September 1920. I 
ordered the Brooksfield and I went right

20:09.209 --> 20:10.211
restructuring again.

20:14.197 --> 20:19.144
In 22 we moved up to Kelly and had an instructor 
there.

20:22.309 --> 20:26.576
Then on the 1923 bombing of the battleships in New 
Jersey and West Virginia. Yeah, tell me about

20:26.596 --> 20:27.537
that. Well, I've got all that covered in detail in 
my memoirs.

20:37.390 --> 20:38.591
Billy Mitchell. Sure. Did you have an opportunity 
to meet Billy Mitchell? Yeah, he was a good friend

20:43.057 --> 20:45.519
of mine. Could you characterize him? What was he 
like? Well, he was a very dynamic man.

20:57.453 --> 21:01.778
On the order of MacArthur and Patton.

21:05.420 --> 21:12.187
lots of physical and nervous energy and

21:05.420 --> 21:12.187
all. He was always in trouble with the General 
Staff in Washington.

21:20.016 --> 21:35.292
He was bound and determined that they were going to 
recognize the Air Corps as being a very valuable

21:20.016 --> 21:35.292
part of the Army and

21:20.016 --> 21:35.292
that the Air Corps could sink battleships do this 
and that. They didn't like him in Washington at

21:38.346 --> 21:40.208
all. Of course, they tried him later.

21:44.493 --> 21:48.158
This is being subordinated. Anyway. What'd you 
think of him? I liked him. Why? Well, I liked him. He

21:54.566 --> 21:56.909
was my type of man. He was very much in love with 
flying and the Air Corps. We called ourselves at

22:05.275 --> 22:06.917
that time. He would stand up and tell these 
superior officers of his in Washington what he

22:06.937 --> 22:19.472
thought. That's the way I always operated.

22:27.921 --> 22:32.186
I just liked him at the time. He liked me. During his 
battleship bombing,

22:34.132 --> 22:52.429
one day he said, Beverly, take up a supercharged 
Martin bomber and see what the absolute ceiling

22:34.132 --> 22:52.429
is, how high it can get loaded, fully loaded. So I 
had it loaded up and went up for an altitude test.

22:59.596 --> 23:00.797
Well, he picked me for that. Then during the 
bombing when there was one battleship still

23:01.469 --> 23:11.063
afloat he said, Beverly take your crew and go up and 
sink that battleship. He picked me out of all the

23:12.645 --> 23:14.527
crews there. So he seemed to like me. And did you 
sink it? Yeah. My bomber put one 1100 pound bomb

23:21.037 --> 23:30.430
right down the smokestack from 11,000 feet.

23:32.924 --> 23:34.065
He was a good bomber. We had the old fashioned Navy 
bomb sites.

23:42.054 --> 23:45.097
Now of course the Northern bomb sites come in since 
then. I don't know what they're using now. I'm so

23:46.499 --> 24:02.256
out of date with the Air Force that I don't know what 
kind of bomb sites they have now but that old Navy

23:46.499 --> 24:02.256
bomb site was very crude compared to what we use 
now.

24:02.472 --> 24:05.356
How did you feel when you sang it? Oh, I was elated of 
course. Then we had this big critique, everybody

24:07.960 --> 24:11.545
in there you know. Mitchell was going over what was 
happening and this and that and then I sent my best

24:12.967 --> 24:22.119
crew up to finish off the last ship. Of course that 
made Captain Ross Cole and myself feel pretty

24:22.139 --> 24:26.926
good. He was my bomber. Were you a captain at that 
time? Had you been promoted to captain then? No,

24:38.556 --> 24:40.179
no. We were all on a single promotion list until the 
mid-thirties. The only way you moved up a file was

24:46.528 --> 24:52.618
somebody would either retire or die, but it was 
ahead of you. So it was 1934 before I moved up to

24:54.020 --> 24:58.787
captain. The promotions during the 1920s and the 
1930s were extraordinarily slow. Was that

25:04.713 --> 25:05.854
demoralizing? No. Everybody else was a 
lieutenant. All my friends and contemporaries

25:10.419 --> 25:23.313
were lieutenants, except at every base they had 
one or two majors, you know, maybe a lieutenant

25:10.419 --> 25:23.313
colonel. The rest were all lieutenants, so it 
didn't bother us. We were getting enough money to

25:27.978 --> 25:45.162
live on and we lived in old shacks there at Kelly 
Field that had been built during 1917 and

25:27.978 --> 25:45.162
converted into living quarters for families. But 
everybody else was living the same way so

25:45.182 --> 25:56.297
we never worried about money or the kind of 
quarters we were having. getting things that seem

25:57.053 --> 26:00.838
to worry him so much today. I don't understand it 
because

26:00.998 --> 26:08.267
it didn't bother us any. Well why do you think it 
bothers him today? I mean what's the difference? I

26:11.972 --> 26:12.753
can't understand it. What's the difference 
between an officer today and an officer back in the

26:12.773 --> 26:16.758
1920s? I think we were back in those days where we 
were in a new game. We were felt ourselves to be

26:22.005 --> 26:25.069
superior to ordinary humans and Americans and 
today

26:25.792 --> 26:53.520
it seems like they think more they're less 
patriotic and think more about money and

26:25.792 --> 26:53.520
promotion

26:25.792 --> 26:53.520
and prestige

26:25.792 --> 26:53.520
rank

26:56.774 --> 27:01.179
Why is their crime rate so much worse today than it 
was back in those days? I don't know. But you don't

27:01.920 --> 27:09.088
know why this has changed now, in the officer 
court? Yeah, I've got lots of good friends out here

27:09.108 --> 27:23.845
at the base at Laughlin, and the colonels out there 
are getting a lot more money than I'm drawing,

27:25.748 --> 27:36.243
retired,

27:25.748 --> 27:36.243
but there seem to be a lot of them seem to be

27:25.748 --> 27:36.243
wanting more money.

27:39.909 --> 27:45.277
Some of them get out and go to flying for the 
airlines, $40,000 and $50,000. $40,000

27:45.297 --> 27:52.988
is starter pay and the chance to go up to $75,000. 
Well, I guess you can't blame them much when that

27:54.132 --> 28:05.906
opportunity wasn't there when I was coming up. 
There were no airlines that they were asking me to

28:05.926 --> 28:13.215
get out and fly for them.

28:13.235 --> 28:20.424
Did you ever think during the 1920's or the 30's 
that you should get out to fly for the mail or

28:13.235 --> 28:20.424
something like the U.S. Mail or something like 
that? No, no. I was very happy where I was.

28:26.566 --> 28:31.772
but then fly that dirty whip. We did fly it. We tried 
to fly the mail when Franklin Roosevelt canceled

28:32.713 --> 28:46.028
all air mail contracts and told Benny Filloy, who 
was chief of the Air Force, to fly the air mail.

28:48.932 --> 28:52.195
We weren't equipped for it. We'd been on 
starvation rations since When the Depression

28:57.464 --> 29:06.753
started in 1929, we had no very poor equipment for 
flying air and mail. We had no radio aids for night

29:06.773 --> 29:17.082
flying, bad weather flying, and we made a mess of 
it. We lost twelve, I think it was, little fine

29:18.644 --> 29:24.349
pilots. plus the airplanes

29:25.460 --> 29:32.188
that they ran. In 1927, Lindbergh crossed the 
Atlantic. Did you ever, what did you think about

29:34.470 --> 29:37.374
that? Well, I thought that,

29:37.534 --> 29:46.525
I wondered if I could stay awake thirty-six hours 
and do that. I didn't think I could. I thought I must

29:47.946 --> 29:53.813
have tremendous physical energy to keep awake

29:54.974 --> 30:10.573
that

29:54.974 --> 30:10.573
long. I just didn't think

30:10.593 --> 30:16.981
I could have done it in time. I'm happy to see him do 
it. Did you know anybody that also wanted to try to

30:17.943 --> 30:19.885
do it? Did you know any of your colleagues or 
yourself ever think about trying to find the

30:20.978 --> 30:26.926
Atlantic? No.

30:31.253 --> 30:34.617
I can't swim.

30:36.420 --> 30:41.587
Did you ever have an opportunity to meet Lundberg?

30:41.607 --> 30:41.828
Yeah. When was that? He and his wife. That was in 
1929. I was up in Kansas City at Chargent. flying

30:50.442 --> 30:53.145
for our global flying school. I was on leave from 
the Air Force.

30:57.790 --> 31:05.038
He was taking the airplane out and he stopped and 
shook hands with me and his wife Ann.

31:07.962 --> 31:09.123
That's the only time I met him. Did you have an 
opportunity to talk to

31:11.005 --> 31:17.112
him? No. Now tell me about this 1926 you said that 
you ordered. Was that your, given your, was it your

31:22.100 --> 31:26.605
first command then?

31:27.365 --> 31:28.206
Uh, I see.

31:31.750 --> 31:34.693
In charge of 120 pilots was it? 120 pilots and 21 
instructors,

31:34.713 --> 31:39.459
yeah. Yeah, that was my first

31:39.479 --> 31:44.344
command.

31:49.370 --> 31:51.773
I loved it. I would assign the students to various 
instructors and if the instructor decided the

31:51.793 --> 32:10.418
student wasn't qualified to be a pilot, I'd give 
him a check ride to verify it. Also, I gave a check

32:10.438 --> 32:17.588
ride to all the students when they graduated and 
moved over to Kelly for the training. So I spent

32:18.614 --> 32:27.225
quite a lot of time checking students for washout 
and for promotion. Were there a number, a large

32:29.688 --> 32:32.952
number of students that didn't make it? Yes, a 
large number. I would say half of them didn't make

32:36.156 --> 32:38.879
it. One just lacked the natural ability to 
coordination of mind and muscle, and judgment of

32:45.378 --> 33:03.001
speed and distance, the temperament, various 
things that go to make a first class, at the time,

32:45.378 --> 33:03.001
army pilot.

33:03.021 --> 33:05.445
And I'd be surprised how many of them don't have 
that. Nowadays, it seems to me like they don't wash

33:07.708 --> 33:14.777
out quite as many. At that time, we were flying, 
what you might say, by the seat of our britches. We

33:22.574 --> 33:44.933
had no instruments to speak of, no radio aids,

33:22.574 --> 33:44.933
and it was strictly contact flying,

33:22.574 --> 33:44.933
and you had to be very alert and have all of these 
qualities some of which are not required today

33:45.773 --> 33:51.863
because it seemed like they fly by push button a 
goody of the day. So, I would say

33:54.367 --> 34:14.278
I don't think the washout rate out here at 
Laughlin, which is the primary flying school,

33:54.367 --> 34:14.278
is anywhere near like it was with us.

34:17.920 --> 34:29.390
I expect it's more like 25%, maybe less

34:17.920 --> 34:29.390
than that. And another thing out here now, they 
have a simulator

34:29.410 --> 34:47.286
that you get in and it's built so that you're 
sitting there operating in this simulator and

34:29.410 --> 34:47.286
you're actually You look like you're flying a 
plane. You may know something about those. They

34:53.482 --> 35:06.721
use it also in

34:53.482 --> 35:06.721
the handling of ships, sea, things like that, 
simulators. And they get a lot of simulator

35:06.741 --> 35:12.769
training before they ever get in an airplane. And I 
think it helps them a great deal. It certainly

35:17.675 --> 35:28.530
saves the government millions of dollars in 
money.

35:28.550 --> 35:32.875
Why do you say that you liked that command very 
much? Why did I say what? That you liked your

35:33.917 --> 35:36.921
command so much, your first one in 1926. Oh,

35:37.261 --> 35:42.809
I just liked it. I liked to be the top man. I like to 
direct people. I think I've got the ability. I know

35:49.064 --> 35:55.750
I have the judgment.

35:55.770 --> 35:58.613
I'm a natural born teacher. I like to teach. When I 
retired from the Air Force, I tried to get a job as a

36:01.956 --> 36:07.881
teacher, and they said I was too old. But I like to 
teach youngsters. great deal of satisfaction in

36:13.649 --> 36:22.562
turning out a good flyer, for instance. I'm very 
proud of the ones that I turned out. And how long did

36:26.388 --> 36:28.491
you stay? And where was this? This is Brooksfield, 
San Antonio. Okay, and how long did you? I was there

36:35.442 --> 36:39.288
two years, and I moved over to Kelly. I wanted to I 
was playing polo with the Kelly Field Polo Team and

36:40.683 --> 36:48.615
I wanted to get over there closer to where the 
horses were.

36:53.101 --> 37:01.273
In 1928 I requested transfer to Kelly from Brooks 
and it was approved. I went over to Kelly and his

37:02.855 --> 37:09.525
instructor for one class in the attack section. 
And I was put in charge of the section in the next

37:10.163 --> 37:13.428
class.

37:17.914 --> 37:22.080
And I was close to the polo stables. And I'd have to 
know that, work out horses, practice polo, magic

37:22.100 --> 37:28.749
play golf. We worked from seven till about one, 
three for the day. So why such a short day? Well, he

37:39.391 --> 37:43.116
worked from 7 to 1 flying and that's not a short day. 
Oh, no. Okay. That's not a short day by any means

37:46.360 --> 37:50.145
with students. Actually, three hours when I was in 
charge over at Brooks. I figured an instructor

37:55.052 --> 38:02.242
could do a good job for three hours and that's about 
all. He had six students, each one got 30 minutes of

38:02.662 --> 38:09.111
dual instruction each day. Later on one or two of 
them washed out while you could give more time to

38:09.783 --> 38:13.629
the others. But three hours, about a day's work as a 
flying instructor. You'd be surprised what it

38:21.199 --> 38:27.629
takes out of you.

38:27.649 --> 38:29.792
Were you a good bullet player? I had a national 
rating of two goals. Really?

38:36.597 --> 38:39.100
And where'd you pick up the polo? Kelly, Kelly 
Field. We had a major garrison at Kelly in 1921. In

38:45.127 --> 38:53.637
1922, a very fine fella, he decided that Air Force 
ought to have a polo team. He went over to Fort Sam

38:53.657 --> 39:04.309
Houston and borrowed horses, built stables at 
Kelly, bought hay and so forth for her. And he

39:05.605 --> 39:10.089
started a polo squad there. And I went down there in 
1922 from Post Field, Oklahoma. I started playing

39:17.416 --> 39:19.778
polo. I'd already, I knew how to ride a horse. I'd 
been on a ranch quite a bit. And I loved the polo.

39:31.048 --> 39:35.612
That's the greatest outdoor game with any of them.

39:39.389 --> 39:44.076
Was the Army Air Force abducted by the Depression? 
Well, we were cut out on a number of airplanes they

39:44.096 --> 39:52.327
bought for us. We were cut out on the amount of 
flying we could do because we couldn't pay for the

39:55.091 --> 39:59.757
gasoline. They gave us all a one month furlough, a 
payless furlough. cut out on the amount of money it

40:07.722 --> 40:18.997
took for salaries, and we, by the way, got that back 
later on. Congress reinstated it, but we spent a

40:19.178 --> 40:26.388
month there without pay, everybody in the Army.

40:29.492 --> 40:32.075
In 1929 or 1930? That was 1930 and 31, 1930 I 
believe. My wife and I just went to Mexico City and

40:39.430 --> 40:44.455
spent the month in Mexico City. Why'd you decide to 
go down? We'd been studying Spanish in San Antonio

40:46.977 --> 40:54.103
with Senorita Oviedo Gonzalez there. I just 
wanted to learn Spanish. So did you down in Mexico

40:58.808 --> 41:01.771
City? She said, I've got some friends in Mexico 
City and I'll fix it up so you live right with them.

41:06.635 --> 41:07.716
That way you can learn. the language quicker, so 
she fixed it up with friends of hers in Mexico City

41:08.354 --> 41:24.438
to meet us at the train, take us to their home, and we 
lived there with them about a week and decided it

41:08.354 --> 41:24.438
was too confining and moved to a hotel. But we 
enjoyed the month down there very much. Didn't

41:31.168 --> 41:36.336
learn much Spanish,

41:31.168 --> 41:36.336
but we had a good time.

41:43.775 --> 41:52.287
Did the status of the Army Air Force change when 
Franklin Roosevelt was elected? Did you get more

41:52.307 --> 41:55.912
money and equipment? Let me see. We started 
getting more equipment

41:57.174 --> 42:03.062
in 1933. I

42:03.082 --> 42:11.554
was at the Air Corps Tactical School. And

42:13.205 --> 42:27.881
we were getting a little more money for airplanes,

42:13.205 --> 42:27.881
but not very much. We tried to fly the airmail in 
1934 and made a botch of it because of lack of

42:29.423 --> 42:38.993
equipment.

42:40.340 --> 42:42.883
instruments and so forth. And that helped us get 
increased appropriations in 1934 and 35. We

42:50.832 --> 42:57.460
started getting some modern equipment. About the 
time we got the Martin B-10 bomber, it was the first

42:57.480 --> 43:06.550
airplane we got where the landing gear folded up.

43:11.319 --> 43:14.444
Retractable gear. Was it a single wing? It was a 
single wing, low wing, and two engines. A friend of

43:21.495 --> 43:27.464
mine, like Duffy, led a flight from Miami to 
Panama. I was down in Panama in 1935 when he came in

43:27.564 --> 43:30.849
there. I got a picture

43:39.892 --> 43:46.240
Duffy and General Brett and the other basic 
commander and so forth. I've got a lot of clippings

43:47.803 --> 43:52.228
and pictures in there that you can... How long are 
you going to be here? I don't know how long it will

43:53.670 --> 43:56.534
take. I was going to say, you can take them back 
tonight and bring them back in the morning. You

44:05.005 --> 44:05.706
might look them over. And also this... I got a copy 
of my manuscript. Let me look

44:12.365 --> 44:32.504
that over. What was your command after you left? 
What was your command in the 1930s? Well, after I

44:41.063 --> 45:03.213
finished school at Montgomery, Alabama, that was 
a nine months course in air corps tactics, I was

44:41.063 --> 45:03.213
sent to the Boston

44:41.063 --> 45:03.213
airport to be commanding, be instructor for the 
Massachusetts National Guard squadron there.

45:04.695 --> 45:06.177
And I despised that work. Why? It had nothing to do. 
They have a good going outfit up there. They didn't

45:12.967 --> 45:17.154
need me as an instructor. I didn't know any more 
about the observation than they did. They were an

45:19.999 --> 45:21.421
observation squadron. But every squadron had to 
have a regular Army instructor. So I was hooked for

45:27.030 --> 45:36.906
that job and I kept trying to get out of it.

45:37.274 --> 45:44.361
temporary duty down at Langley Field, Virginia as 
a student in celestial navigation. Well, that

45:44.381 --> 45:48.245
took up about six weeks. And then they decided I 
ought to stay there as an instructor in the next

45:48.265 --> 45:53.530
course. Well, that suited me fine. Anything 
rather than go back to that National Guard

45:55.552 --> 45:59.336
squadron. So I stayed down at Langley as 
instructor in the navigation for the next course.

46:07.733 --> 46:34.652
and that went through Christmas and then about 
January I think Roosevelt canceled air and mail

46:07.733 --> 46:34.652
contracts with civilian airlines and told the Air 
Corps to fly the air and mail

46:07.733 --> 46:34.652
and I was up at Floyd Bennett Airport there right 
outside New York City to bring an airplane up

46:35.678 --> 46:39.502
there. Major Jones, who was in charge of airmail 
for that area, said, get on the train, go to

46:41.003 --> 46:54.537
Pittsburgh as a control officer. Stop the killing 
out there. I think they'd lost something like five

46:58.621 --> 47:05.128
or six airplanes just on that one route.
