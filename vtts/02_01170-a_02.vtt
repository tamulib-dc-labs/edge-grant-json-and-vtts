WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:16.172
Plain about the low level of support, even in these 
restricted times, there's vastly more money

00:02.933 --> 00:16.172
available than the old bailing wire and sealing 
wax days at Lowell. Yeah. I mean, when I went to

00:17.134 --> 00:29.732
Lowell, I mean, typical salary levels, I don't 
remember what I was paid, but it's less than we pay a

00:17.134 --> 00:29.732
graduate student assistant coming in now. Yeah. 
who's supposedly spending most of his time just

00:30.406 --> 00:33.770
studying. So yeah, and those of us who've held 
positions for a long time, I've been 30 years now,

00:33.790 --> 00:54.675
or going on 30 years at University of Arizona, our 
salaries have fallen behind, so it's called the

00:33.790 --> 00:54.675
compression effect, considerably behind new 
appointees. It's only because, well, I've been

00:55.465 --> 01:00.192
in, I mean, my house is paid for, so I don't have to 
pay a big mortgage. And so, in a sense, I feel that I

01:00.212 --> 01:04.538
can afford to draw less salary. But

01:04.558 --> 01:14.852
I think there's too much focus and too much 
attention on short-term science, new people

01:04.558 --> 01:14.852
coming in. They have to move very rapidly. You've 
got to publish results very quickly, pick up, I

01:18.197 --> 01:23.785
think, many, many superficial things. In-depth 
science has suffered, and I don't think there's a

01:27.425 --> 01:39.020
proper balance of support for deeper studies, 
more controversial studies.

01:43.286 --> 01:48.532
So, yeah, I don't have a lot of sympathy for the 
complaints of many of the younger scientists. I

01:48.553 --> 01:50.515
mean, I don't think...

01:52.672 --> 01:59.643
I don't think that's the

01:52.672 --> 01:59.643
central problem that we face in astronomy. I think 
we're overpopulated in astronomy, and I think

02:01.265 --> 02:08.516
we're driven by wanting to produce results 
quickly. I'm an old-fashioned astronomer who

02:08.536 --> 02:19.172
believed that the way Mount Wilson and places like 
that worked years ago, where you could study a

02:08.536 --> 02:19.172
problem, think about it, and publish a definitive 
analysis. I mean, it worked. kind of work that

02:20.009 --> 02:23.053
Merrill did, and Joy, and so on. Those, I think, 
that's the way I still think there's room for that

02:23.653 --> 02:31.002
kind of support in astronomy. And we see very 
little of it. I want to ask you one general, one

02:33.445 --> 02:36.289
specific question. The specific one is, what's 
the reaction of people that you meet when they find

02:37.450 --> 02:43.317
out you're an astronomer? good, bad, and 
different surprises? I think the general public

02:46.229 --> 02:55.720
is well attuned to astronomy, and I don't think 
we've ever had a problem selling astronomy

02:46.229 --> 02:55.720
fundamentally. Gee, there's a lot of 
misunderstanding of what astronomy is, but I

02:55.740 --> 03:04.850
think there's an automatic, fairly positive 
reaction to astronomy. Gee, yeah, I mean, it's

03:04.870 --> 03:09.535
telling us what's out there, and there's a natural 
interest in that. I don't think there's any

03:09.555 --> 03:12.358
problem at that level. with getting an initial 
positive reaction to astronomy. It's at the next

03:18.352 --> 03:25.303
level when you start asking for money or 
explaining how expensive it is to run this

03:18.352 --> 03:25.303
business that people get a little puzzled. And, 
well, even then, well, just if you give us the

03:25.323 --> 03:35.439
proper information, the proper justification, 
maybe we're not fundamentally objecting to it. I

03:35.459 --> 03:40.607
think we have more problem internally in 
astronomy in the way we've decided to allocate our

03:35.459 --> 03:40.607
resources. And I can be perfectly honest in making 
one of the, a strong comparison that I'm sure has

03:41.212 --> 03:51.823
been made many times between the way, say, NRAO and 
NOAO are run. NRAO is a real service institution

03:51.963 --> 03:57.488
that really helps astronomers with individual 
ideas. Doesn't get any complaints either. Right.

04:01.292 --> 04:02.513
It's a great institution. And the controversy 
that revolves around NOAO, I'm not an authority on

04:02.533 --> 04:10.341
that, but it's an entirely different situation. 
But you live in Tucson, right? Yeah. That's

04:11.941 --> 04:17.331
the way things are funded now. I mean, if you want to 
do a research program or do an observing program or

04:17.651 --> 04:31.536
apply for a grant, you have got to say exactly what 
you're going to do and exactly what you're going to

04:17.651 --> 04:31.536
find. In the kind of work that I do, you can't do 
that. I mean, we're investigating a phenomenon

04:34.713 --> 04:37.838
that we don't understand. And historically, 
that's where the major advances in science have

04:37.898 --> 04:43.166
come. I think if you look at the history of science, 
and I'm no authority on history of science like you

04:43.226 --> 05:02.434
are, Ron, but it's not out of these big 
institutions necessarily that the real advances

04:43.226 --> 05:02.434
come, because the proposals are reviewed in such 
microscopic detail that that there really isn't

05:03.055 --> 05:06.900
any question left. It's just refining the next 
significant figure or something like that. It's

05:11.486 --> 05:27.308
only the tenured professors with some far-out 
idea or people that are willing to take a big risk

05:11.486 --> 05:27.308
that can investigate the unknown and take on an 
observing program or do an observing program

05:11.486 --> 05:27.308
where they don't know what they're going to find. 
Because you can't write that kind of proposal.

05:29.399 --> 05:30.281
Nobody's going to fund it. Nobody's going to 
support it. So Galileo wouldn't stand a chance

05:31.503 --> 05:33.286
today. No. I mean, to build a telescope to, I mean, 
everybody knew what you were going to see when you

05:33.646 --> 05:41.220
looked at Jupiter or something. It wasn't going to 
have moon circling around it. There was nothing

05:45.427 --> 05:48.332
unknown out there. So you can't write that kind of 
proposal. And I think that's exactly the kind of

05:53.005 --> 05:58.091
proposal that we need. The same is true for 
publication. When you send a paper in to the

06:00.034 --> 06:14.492
Astrophysical Journal or to a main journal, I've 
had plenty of experience with this, where you try

06:00.034 --> 06:14.492
to develop a new idea or suggest a new 
interpretation. If it's inconsistent with what

06:15.433 --> 06:22.202
is, quote, presently known or presently being 
modeled, you're going to meet immense

06:22.688 --> 06:26.994
resistance. And to introduce a new or a different 
idea is very, very difficult. You can't do it. I

06:33.904 --> 06:47.262
can't work with graduate students or people that 
future depend upon their being able to get a job

06:33.904 --> 06:47.262
that having connection with TIFT is not wise. I can 
do it because I've got tenure, because I've got

06:47.613 --> 07:06.251
security, and because my salary is big enough that 
my expenses aren't that big, I can afford to go to

06:47.613 --> 07:06.251
the AAS meeting and have my own home computer and a 
few computer programs so I can generate poster

06:47.613 --> 07:06.251
papers, I can write papers. I may even end up having 
to pick up some of my publication charges. There

07:12.097 --> 07:14.059
aren't many people in a position to do that. 
there's something wrong with the way science is

07:14.697 --> 07:19.323
being supported and funded. I don't think we need a 
lot of money for this, but I think there ought to be

07:19.404 --> 07:27.495
means of handling new ideas. We ought to somehow 
try to create a means of supporting new ideas based

07:28.136 --> 07:39.732
upon just the experience with the people. I mean, 
people know that I do good observational work.

07:46.504 --> 07:49.647
There ought to be a means of supporting these kinds 
of things. I'm not speaking specifically for

07:49.667 --> 07:53.271
myself, but I know there are a lot of people out 
there. I assume this criticism applies to NSF and

07:53.291 --> 08:04.182
NASA together in that they are both unwilling to 
take any chances whatsoever. Right. I mean,

08:04.482 --> 08:09.527
Jocelyn Gill's office, for example, and this was 
an aspect of the older NASA, was willing to take

08:09.845 --> 08:16.113
this kind of a risk in the Lunar Programs Lab and 
Marshall Space Flight Center. They said, yeah. I

08:17.055 --> 08:19.057
mean, sure, they were vested interest in this. But 
on the other hand, there were no strings attached

08:19.077 --> 08:21.721
to the support. They say, go out and build some good 
programs that we can fly. Sure, they were

08:26.127 --> 08:27.108
interested. They wanted programs developed. But 
they gave the support to people who were motivated

08:28.630 --> 08:35.038
to try something new. We don't see much of that now. 
and this collecting of everybody into teams to do a

08:38.077 --> 08:44.523
specific job, there's no flexibility. There's no 
ability of the scientists to develop a completely

08:44.844 --> 08:49.568
new idea. We've seen these plateaus in the history 
of science frequently. Everything is known, and

08:53.292 --> 09:01.140
all we've got to do is work out the next details. And 
we aren't any closer to the final answers than we

09:01.200 --> 09:07.746
were in the 18th century. A lot of people think we 
are.
