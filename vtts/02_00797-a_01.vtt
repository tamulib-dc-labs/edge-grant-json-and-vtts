Today's

00:01.448 --> 00:13.959
date is the 22nd of September, 1982. This is Terry 
Anderson. This is a test. Today is the 22nd of

00:18.784 --> 00:20.706
September, 1982. I'm here with Dr. Fred Morrow, 
and we're going to talk about his background to

00:20.726 --> 00:27.272
begin with. Tell me about your background, where 
you're from, your parents, Early life? Well, I was

00:34.360 --> 00:39.187
born in Moscow, Idaho, May 4, 1909.

00:44.234 --> 00:51.464
When I was about two years old, we moved to Montana 
where my dad had a homestead. We stayed there as

00:53.266 --> 01:00.717
homesteaders for just a couple of years and then 
back to the state of Washington. where we lived in

01:02.114 --> 01:20.539
Molson, Washington, and

01:02.114 --> 01:20.539
Spokane, Washington, and back to Moscow, Idaho, 
where I went to school, to grade school, high

01:02.114 --> 01:20.539
school, and to the University of Idaho. I finished 
University of Idaho with a degree in business

01:20.559 --> 01:27.328
administration,

01:20.559 --> 01:27.328
and Because that was at a time when there was a 
national depression, we- 1934. 1934, we went and

01:32.576 --> 01:41.814
moved to Pullman, Washington, where I went to the 
College of Veterinary Medicine, got a degree in

01:32.576 --> 01:41.814
veterinary medicine. Is that the main reason that 
you went to veterinary medicine? That's right,

01:45.702 --> 01:47.806
the main reason. You were thinking you wanted to be 
a businessman first then? I wanted to get a job. It

01:52.032 --> 02:02.086
was a tough time, and my primary concern was to get 
into a field where there was an opportunity for a

01:52.032 --> 02:02.086
job, and veterinary medicine was one of the few 
fields where there was jobs open. And that was the

02:03.488 --> 02:06.692
only reason I went to college veterinary 
medicine. What about your prerequisites? Well, I

02:08.955 --> 02:16.705
had taken care of those pretty well, because 
initially I was going to be a dentist before I...

02:08.955 --> 02:16.705
Oh, I see. So I had taken some pre-med along with... 
business administration degree that I got at the

02:20.448 --> 02:23.692
University of Idaho. So then I finished the vet 
school in 37 and took a job with the US Department of

02:25.514 --> 02:45.798
Agriculture for just a few months and then had a 
better opportunity with the University of Idaho

02:25.514 --> 02:45.798
to become an assistant professor there in their 
microbiology department. I stayed there about a

02:45.818 --> 02:49.763
year and a half and then had an opportunity for a 
fellowship at Cornell to get a PhD. So I went to

02:54.796 --> 03:06.739
Cornell and had a fellowship and worked on my PhD 
until 1941

02:54.796 --> 03:06.739
when I got pulled in the Army. Fortunately I was in 
the Reserve. So I then served in the Army and until

03:15.376 --> 03:19.080
1964 for 23 years. No kidding, as a reserve officer 
on active duty during the war and reserve during

03:19.380 --> 03:25.046
peacetime. And then after about 1943

03:25.066 --> 03:43.864
or 44, I got shifted into the regular army, applied 
and became a regular army officer about 1933. I

03:44.300 --> 03:45.983
mean, by 1944. And I stayed on through 1964.

03:53.715 --> 03:59.103
And all of my assignments in the military were in 
research, fortunately. And the Army also gave me a

04:00.425 --> 04:12.484
year off to go back to, actually, to Rockefeller 
Foundation in New York City, where I finished my

04:00.425 --> 04:12.484
PhD. Oh, so you hadn't completed it. I hadn't 
completed it when I was at Cornell. They put me in

04:17.079 --> 04:20.423
the service before I got it finished. Let's stop 
right here for a second. So you finished a Ph.D.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.688
then in 1948. Yes, that's right, even though I had 
started it in 1940, in 1937 actually. But because

04:32.939 --> 04:38.366
of those several years of interruption with the 
military, it wasn't completed until 48. Where did

04:39.287 --> 04:41.830
they send you in the military during the Second 
World War?

04:45.792 --> 05:00.293
Well, fortunately, I was initially assigned to a 
research lab at Front Royal, Virginia, from 41 to

04:45.792 --> 05:00.293
42, and then to a gross eel in Canada, which was a 
foreign disease control station. There was a

05:01.594 --> 05:11.108
threat of biological warfare under this 
hemisphere at that time, so there we studied

05:01.594 --> 05:11.108
foreign diseases, rinderpest and similar 
foreign diseases. Then in 1945, to evaluate the

05:12.488 --> 05:28.034
vaccine we had developed at Grosse Ile, one other 
fellow and I went to Kenya in East Africa to test the

05:12.488 --> 05:28.034
vaccine in the field that we had prepared against 
rinderpest in Canada. And it worked just fine, but

05:29.015 --> 05:38.631
this experience of working in Canada and East 
Africa got me indoctrinated into the great need on

05:39.117 --> 05:44.303
a worldwide basis for control of foreign animal 
diseases of food producing livestock.

05:46.946 --> 06:00.783
And so then when I came back from Africa in 54, I 
managed an assignment with the Armed Forces of

05:46.946 --> 06:00.783
Sina.

06:04.627 --> 06:05.008
1954. 1954. I don't want to get these dates mixed up 
with that. Chief of the Armed Forces Institute of

06:09.416 --> 06:12.461
Pathology Research Committee? Yeah, I went back 
to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in 64. I

06:17.869 --> 06:23.117
mean, sorry, 54.

06:24.819 --> 06:33.913
And was there in the research laboratory working 
on vaccines for equine encephalomyelitis and for

06:35.260 --> 06:49.097
Jap B encephalitis and things of that sort until 
1951

06:35.260 --> 06:49.097
when I had an opportunity to go back to Africa.

06:52.622 --> 06:53.904
I'm getting these dates wrong. Oh, in 1951 then you 
were field director of a research team in Africa,

06:53.924 --> 06:57.989
that's right. Yes, that's right. What happened 
was that in 1945 I went from Canada to Africa to test

07:04.268 --> 07:34.208
a vaccine then when I came back from there I was 
assigned to Walter Reed Laboratories from 45 to 51

07:04.268 --> 07:34.208
and then I went back to Africa 51 to 54 and then was 
assigned to the Armed Forces Institute of

07:04.268 --> 07:34.208
Pathology where I stayed until 1961 during that 
time I was, as it says there, in charge of first

07:34.542 --> 07:46.858
biology, laboratories, and then later the 
Department of Pathology also. And was promoted to

07:46.878 --> 07:50.103
colonel during that time period. And then went to 
Fort Knox, Kentucky, where I was in charge of the

07:52.646 --> 07:58.934
pathology department. But all of this was in some 
relationship to animal disease research. And

08:07.015 --> 08:28.458
then upon retirement from the Army in 64, I 
accepted the job here as Associate Dean for

08:07.015 --> 08:28.458
Research at the College of Veterinary Medicine 
with the intent and statement that I wanted to

08:07.015 --> 08:28.458
establish a program here in Tropical Veterinary 
Medicine because of my earnest interest in this

08:07.015 --> 08:28.458
field. Now why did you retire from the Army? When I 
became a regular army officer in about 44, they

08:32.896 --> 08:45.872
gave me credit for seven years based on age so that 
my 30 years was up in 1964. So I had a 30-year

08:46.713 --> 08:49.557
military retirement in 64. That's why I left, even 
though I was a long ways from 60. I hadn't reached. I

09:00.672 --> 09:05.059
can't think just at the second how old I was at the 
time, but that's incidental. Fifty-six?

09:07.362 --> 09:08.324
Fifty-six, yeah. Well, then I came here and served 
as associate dean. Now, did you have other offers

09:11.048 --> 09:15.575
when you retired from the Army? Yes, yeah. There 
were lots of opportunities at that time. But the

09:21.264 --> 09:26.612
main reason I came here was because of the 
opportunity to work in tropical veterinary

09:26.879 --> 09:30.965
medicine as well as to serve as associate dean. 
Sure. Because of the Texas location close to the

09:32.307 --> 09:39.838
Mexican border, it was an ideal place to work on 
tropical diseases, you see. It was a prime reason I

09:41.300 --> 09:43.002
came here. Yes, there were several other 
opportunities at the time. Mostly in vet schools?

09:50.413 --> 09:56.802
Oh, yes, in vet schools at Warson State and in 
California and different places where there were

09:50.413 --> 09:56.802
opportunities. But they promised you when you 
came here that you'd be able to work on tropical

09:57.068 --> 10:00.913
diseases. Well, they, at least Dean Price, was 
encouraging that this was a possibility, and then

10:01.554 --> 10:25.708
after I had been here about a year and gotten 
settled down into working as associate dean for

10:01.554 --> 10:25.708
research,

10:01.554 --> 10:25.708
we developed a proposal for a program in the 
Institute of Tropical Veterinary Medicine,

10:01.554 --> 10:25.708
which was approved by the dean and by President 
Rudder and fortunately the administrative setup

10:26.549 --> 10:51.308
was such that when President Rudder gave us the 
okay we were free to go out and seek funds and

10:26.549 --> 10:51.308
develop the program here which we then did in 1965 
and 66

10:26.549 --> 10:51.308
and we obtained funds initially from the 
Rockefeller Foundation Now how'd you get that, by

10:52.790 --> 10:55.194
writing a grant proposal? Yes, writing a grant 
proposal and through interviews with the

10:55.334 --> 11:00.642
concerned people. And fortunately, the 
Rockefeller Foundation was already active with a

11:02.906 --> 11:20.653
program in Columbia in South America, so it wasn't 
difficult for us to integrate into that program

11:02.906 --> 11:20.653
with research that could be conducted there that 
could not be conducted in Texas.

11:28.714 --> 11:32.037
So that's why we have this Colombian connection 
now. That's right. Because I was wondering why you

11:33.298 --> 11:37.842
went with Colombia and not with Mexico or 
someplace closer. Well, there had been some

11:37.862 --> 11:50.674
contacts and some interviews and some work done 
with Mexico, but it was because of the Rockefeller

11:37.862 --> 11:50.674
Foundation collaboration with a Colombian 
project at SEAT, their Center for International

11:51.329 --> 12:09.391
Tropical Agriculture, that we first became 
involved in their laboratory in Bogota,

11:51.329 --> 12:09.391
Colombia. And we had our own lab then in Bogota for 
about two years. And then our activities were

12:14.838 --> 12:20.104
moved to SEAT in Colombia to down near

12:21.518 --> 12:26.323
Cali, Columbia.

12:29.245 --> 12:47.162
And there for then, for the following period of 
about 10 years, we had an active program in Cali

12:29.245 --> 12:47.162
with six or eight faculty people from here in 
Columbia, as well as the staff here at Texas A&M.

12:49.044 --> 12:51.306
And those things are our parents from the papers 
that I have given you, the details on that. Okay.

12:58.557 --> 13:05.909
And then- So this is in 1966 when you proposed for 
development, and when did you get the grant? Well,

13:06.630 --> 13:07.371
right away. We got it in 66. We started the program 
in 66. Okay, you also had a research proposal to the

13:11.257 --> 13:15.583
United States AID. Yes, and it was funded- In 67, 
yeah. And then in about 68 or 69, I'm not sure

13:21.121 --> 13:42.995
exactly which now, we got a separate second 
funding from USAID for the so-called 211D

13:21.121 --> 13:42.995
program, which permitted us to work in Guyana, 
South America, as well as in Columbia. So we had

13:44.317 --> 13:49.525
some research going on in Guyana as well as in 
Columbia, South America for some time. Now, when

13:55.127 --> 14:02.875
you originally made these proposals, did you have 
specific diseases or specific areas that you

13:55.127 --> 14:02.875
wanted to work? Yes, we did. What were those ideas 
and how did that change? We were primarily

14:07.080 --> 14:15.529
concerned with hemoprotozoal diseases, 
Babesia, Anaplasma, because those are major

14:15.796 --> 14:33.143
handicaps to livestock production, cattle 
production particularly, in Latin America, also

14:15.796 --> 14:33.143
because the so-called Texas fever that once was a 
major problem here was still prevalent in Latin

14:15.796 --> 14:33.143
American countries. That disease had once cost 
the United States about $40 million a year. And we

14:40.675 --> 14:43.660
knew that to eradicate it in Latin American 
countries would increase their productivity

14:44.467 --> 14:48.932
considerably. It would also provide a major 
opportunity for Canadian livestock producers to

14:49.913 --> 15:14.322
be able to ship, I'm sorry, I mean Texas livestock 
producers to be able to ship Texas cattle to Latin

14:49.913 --> 15:14.322
America to improve their breeding stock and 
greatly enhance the market for Texas cattle

14:49.913 --> 15:14.322
abroad. And we later, after we had done quite a bit 
of research in developing means of immunizing

15:15.263 --> 15:36.517
against Babesia, we did send some herds from Texas 
to Latin America, which got along just fine and

15:15.263 --> 15:36.517
stayed healthy down there and improved local 
livestock breed. Great. And what countries in

15:38.179 --> 15:39.642
Latin America? Well, we sent some to some Central 
American countries and also some herds to

15:44.069 --> 15:49.234
Columbia. How'd you pick these cattle? Where'd 
you get these cattle from? Well, they were Texas

15:52.597 --> 15:59.723
breeders that had high quality cattle that wanted 
to sell them in Latin America for a good price. And

15:59.843 --> 16:05.588
they were able to do that, you see, some breeding 
cows and bulls and so on. And because of the success

16:05.608 --> 16:14.076
of those efforts, we received offers for and grant 
funds from African countries that also would like

16:14.883 --> 16:26.734
very much to improve their breeds of cattle in 
Africa if they could be immunized against these

16:14.883 --> 16:26.734
same diseases which are prevalent over there. In 
fact, we had a ten million dollar offer from

16:27.815 --> 16:30.937
Nigeria. They were going to provide the money and 
they have enough oil money there now that they

16:31.858 --> 16:37.423
could afford to do that. Did they? No, they didn't 
because By that time, which was in the late 70s or

16:43.469 --> 16:56.882
mid-70s,

16:43.469 --> 16:56.882
there had been administrative changes at the 
university higher than the College of Veterinary

16:43.469 --> 16:56.882
Medicine. OK, well, we'll get to those. But let's 
get back then to the early 1960s. In other words, it

17:02.427 --> 17:09.814
seems to me that, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it 
seems to me that there were not only medical

17:10.402 --> 17:18.250
reasons and research reasons to go and set up the 
institute, but also economic reasons? Is that

17:18.270 --> 17:18.890
true? Yes, you bet. That was a major consideration 
because there's no question but what the world in

17:20.052 --> 17:30.922
general is in desperate need of more food 
resources. And the cattle, for example, food

17:32.464 --> 17:38.670
producing livestock in many countries are 
greatly handicapped by disease. So to eliminate

17:40.355 --> 17:48.843
disease problems would increase their 
productivity and make them more self-sufficient

17:40.355 --> 17:48.843
countries. And even in the early, late 60s and 70s, 
there was at that time many countries of the world

17:48.863 --> 17:58.191
where people were starving. And matter of fact, 
there's some 15,000 people starving to death

17:59.192 --> 18:10.362
every year at that time. and about one eighth of the 
world's population going to be hungry every

18:11.455 --> 18:17.663
night. So there was a desperate need to increase 
world food production. And that was the basis

18:22.468 --> 18:39.589
primarily of our incentive, plus the fact that to 
do something about improving the health

18:22.468 --> 18:39.589
environment for livestock abroad, they could 
improve their livestock and make them more

18:22.468 --> 18:39.589
productive. and provide a tremendous market for 
the United States to export better breeding

18:40.295 --> 18:46.223
stock, which we have. For example,

18:46.283 --> 18:55.735
one American dairy cow will produce as much milk as 
ten African cows. No kidding. And one American

18:57.258 --> 19:01.763
steer will produce as much beef as about six of 
theirs. Those animals in Africa for the most part

19:03.085 --> 19:08.192
are terribly stunted for lack of disease control, 
lack of adequate nutrition, lack of water, and

19:08.746 --> 19:15.396
breeding. Because for centuries, they have been 
geared to survival, not to productivity. While

19:22.126 --> 19:29.016
our animals have been fed well and well cared for 
and properly bred and increased for

19:22.126 --> 19:29.016
productivity. So there's a tremendous need and 
opportunity to improve livestock abroad, and

19:31.059 --> 19:35.766
that Those two things are the key factors that 
stimulated our efforts in this direction. And

19:43.275 --> 19:53.789
because of world population, now the need for 
increased food production is greater today than

19:43.275 --> 19:53.789
it was 15, 20 years ago. Now, during the 1960s, when 
your institute is beginning to get steam, there is

19:54.229 --> 20:05.905
a tremendous shift in American history and in 
society toward are with people who are much more

20:06.695 --> 20:09.739
interested in the world. LBJ at this time comes out 
and starts talking about overpopulation of the

20:10.380 --> 20:15.688
earth. We start sending birth control pills and 
stuff like that to India. It's been foreign aid the

20:19.974 --> 20:22.337
first time we've ever done that. Did any of this 
have any impact whatsoever on the institute?

20:32.151 --> 20:33.212
Well, yes. All of those things which have a bearing 
on population control are important factors in

20:36.142 --> 20:52.586
relation to world need for food, but there has 
persisted since the early 60s a growing need for

20:36.142 --> 20:52.586
food on a worldwide basis because of increases in 
population. It's somewhat of a tragedy that the

20:53.748 --> 21:04.984
scientific developments which have controlled 
disease and increased longevity of man have

20:53.748 --> 21:04.984
also had such an effect on population that they 
have increased population to the point where food

21:05.420 --> 21:15.534
supplies cannot increase as fast as population 
has. See, in 1600, it took a thousand years for

21:15.594 --> 21:20.421
population to double. Today, world population is 
doubling every 30 years. And in Salvador, for

21:25.267 --> 21:29.753
example, every 21 years. In Kenya, every 28 years. 
with population increasing so much more rapidly

21:33.449 --> 22:02.359
than food supplies possibly can there's bound to 
be desperate starvation

21:33.449 --> 22:02.359
or war will wipe them out as an alternative okay 
let's talk about some of the specific research

21:33.449 --> 22:02.359
some of the other specific research programs that 
you had at the institute

21:33.449 --> 22:02.359
well we were primarily concerned with these 
hemoprotozole diseases. Now this was done from

22:06.514 --> 22:15.527
the standpoint of trying to develop vaccines but 
also a medicinal means of controlling those

22:06.514 --> 22:15.527
diseases. We also received some small grants from 
drug manufacturers in the United States that

22:17.049 --> 22:29.307
wanted us to evaluate drugs that could be used to 
help with the control of these same diseases. No

22:29.708 --> 22:32.131
kidding. So we had Funds from three sources 
really, from Rockefeller, from Aid, and from some

22:33.322 --> 22:46.356
commercial sources.

22:46.376 --> 22:47.418
Did you have any breakthroughs? What did you 
consider your successes? Well, the major

22:51.963 --> 22:58.690
successes were in providing a means of immunizing 
against Babesia. And also methods for the

22:59.931 --> 23:03.295
treatment of anaplasmosis. Both of these were 
definitely improved and were far better because

23:03.494 --> 23:08.940
of our experience with them than they had been 
before. To my knowledge, we were the first people

23:10.922 --> 23:20.313
that were ever able to export immunized cattle 
from Texas to Latin America and have them survive

23:10.922 --> 23:20.313
down there. And also, large studies conducted in 
Columbia, we were able to immunize young animals

23:31.642 --> 23:44.954
and then let them run in the field where they were 
fully exposed and they resisted the disease and

23:31.642 --> 23:44.954
remained healthy, you see, and were far more 
productive with very minimal losses compared to

23:31.642 --> 23:44.954
native cattle. Could you give me some statistics? 
I mean, how larger did the cattle get? How much

23:50.499 --> 23:52.541
longer did they live in general? How much more 
productive were they? Did you do any surveys as far

23:55.063 --> 23:57.565
as that was concerned? Yes, and I'm sure that that 
there is ample evidence within the papers that are

23:59.823 --> 24:09.118
published papers which are in this collection 
here that will give you that information. And

24:09.258 --> 24:18.292
there was definite progress because well for one 
thing you couldn't import cattle before and have

24:09.258 --> 24:18.292
them survive. Eighty percent of them would die. No 
kidding. Eighty percent? That's right. They just

24:23.500 --> 24:26.505
can't stand those diseases down there where 
there's tremendous tick populations that carry

24:26.806 --> 24:29.712
the disease. And if they come in as susceptible 
adults, they just don't last long. Almost all of

24:34.682 --> 24:37.388
them die. But when they're immunized as young 
animals, then they get along all right. Are the

24:43.902 --> 24:45.004
animals still there? Yes. Yeah, they're still 
doing fine. And have you heard anything over the

24:48.119 --> 24:52.946
last year or so about that? Well, you see, once 
immunity is established, then exposure to the

24:53.246 --> 25:02.959
disease by infected ticks only stimulates their 
increased immunity. So if they get through that

25:02.979 --> 25:10.890
early period of when they're no longer 
susceptible, they become increasingly

25:02.979 --> 25:10.890
resistant. So they'll live as long as any other 
cattle. Now, did you hear, I mean, were there...

25:17.077 --> 25:22.542
projects that you thought you could make some 
headway but turned out that they were not

25:17.077 --> 25:22.542
successful?

25:25.144 --> 25:32.971
Well, all of these things you go through growing 
stages of constant improvement until you get it

25:25.144 --> 25:32.971
the best you can, you know. So I'm sure that in our 
early trials down there we weren't as successful

25:34.233 --> 25:43.381
as we were in later ones because one has to learn how 
to do these things and do them right. But were there

25:43.661 --> 25:45.683
things that you thought that you failed at?

25:48.970 --> 25:58.304
No, I don't really think so because the method of 
immunization that we used in Latin America and

25:48.970 --> 25:58.304
here is called pre-immunization. It's a matter of 
developing a strain of the organism which is mild

25:59.485 --> 26:11.403
from the standpoint of producing disease but 
still produces a good solid immunity. In other

26:12.645 --> 26:16.931
words, you give them a little bug and then let the 
natural forces take over. That's right. was to

26:18.603 --> 26:37.505
develop a strain of organisms that could be used in 
young, fully susceptible cattle that would not

26:18.603 --> 26:37.505
produce disease in terms of any clinical signs, 
but would develop a strong immunity that was

26:18.603 --> 26:37.505
lifelong lasting. And it was certainly 
maintained even better when they were later

26:37.906 --> 26:47.597
exposed to the fully virulent field strains of the 
disease. so it turned out very well now sure there

26:48.286 --> 27:14.884
were trial and errors in the beginning in 
developing this strain to the point where it was

26:48.286 --> 27:14.884
safe to use and where it would produce good 
immunity and sometimes we use some of these

26:48.286 --> 27:14.884
medicinal agents along with the early 
inoculation to get them through that first stage

26:48.286 --> 27:14.884
and keep them healthy while they developed 
immunity but later we didn't even have to do that So

27:16.079 --> 27:18.963
it's a growing trial and error process. Is the 
vital time the first six months or a year? Well the

27:22.307 --> 27:32.601
first six or eight weeks is a critical time until 
they get through the possibility of developing

27:22.307 --> 27:32.601
clinical illness and become immune. Now are there 
differences between treating the animals or

27:32.882 --> 27:44.297
giving the vaccination to animals who are down in 
the country versus giving them to American cattle

27:32.882 --> 27:44.297
and then shipping them down?

27:45.644 --> 27:56.762
The main difference is that indigenous cattle 
produce calves which have some level of immunity

27:45.644 --> 27:56.762
because they get it from the colostrum of their 
mother. So they're a little better to start with

27:58.144 --> 28:03.393
than the fully susceptible cattle here. But in 
either case, they can be immunized properly. Now

28:10.822 --> 28:16.949
let's talk a little bit about the relationships 
that you had with the state and federal

28:10.822 --> 28:16.949
government. You must have had some contact. The 
Institute must have had contact with the state

28:19.532 --> 28:22.755
government and the federal government. Well, 
that's right. We did. We met frequently with the

28:24.357 --> 28:34.228
USAID in Washington because they were funding our 
project. We met with the USDA numerous times

28:34.248 --> 28:39.073
because They were sincerely interested in our 
activities. As a matter of fact, some of our former

28:44.378 --> 28:56.993
staff are now working on a USDA project in the state 
of Washington to carry on the same work that we were

28:44.378 --> 28:56.993
doing here. I was going to ask about that. Dr. 
Cutler, who was a principal research man for us in

29:01.118 --> 29:09.347
this program, is now heading a laboratory in 
Washington State with branches in Idaho, and just

29:09.682 --> 29:17.694
doing the same work and continuing on with it. Were 
there other colleges that had, at the time when you

29:17.714 --> 29:23.562
set up the institute, were there other colleges in 
the country? Was there any other vet school that

29:23.582 --> 29:28.169
you knew of that was doing tropical diseases? This 
was the first program in tropical veterinary

29:28.209 --> 29:33.096
medicine, to my knowledge, in the United States. 
No kidding. Now there were some individual

29:36.000 --> 29:39.385
professors in a couple of places that had some 
interest, but this was the first program with a

29:39.871 --> 29:46.902
sizable staff. And that's another question I 
have. What was the size of the staff? How did it

29:51.609 --> 29:52.110
grow? How did it change? Well, it grew from one or 
two of us to where we had,

29:53.833 --> 30:06.452
well, the details are in some of this write-up that 
I have given you, but we typically had about six

30:07.917 --> 30:35.629
staff members from Texas A&M who were professors 
and assistant professors, and then probably 15 or

30:07.917 --> 30:35.629
20 technicians, and usually half a dozen graduate 
students, many of whom were foreign graduate

30:07.917 --> 30:35.629
students from Latin America and Europe and even 
Africa, people that were sent here to learn more

30:07.917 --> 30:35.629
about this program so they could help when they got 
home. So between the Columbian program, the

30:37.718 --> 30:54.188
Guyana program, and Texas, we probably had 
ordinarily eight or ten staff members and about

30:37.718 --> 30:54.188
twenty technicians plus graduate students. 
Okay, let's get back to the relationships that you

30:54.529 --> 30:58.516
had with the federal government. Did, in what, I 
mean were there Of course, this program could have

31:01.124 --> 31:06.271
implications for the State Department and for 
foreign policy. Did you have any relations with

31:06.571 --> 31:09.815
the State Department? Was there any time that they 
came out and they said, well, we don't want you to-

31:09.836 --> 31:28.380
If you would like to look at the CV there with the 
consultant group and the committees,

31:09.836 --> 31:28.380
there was lots of interest.

31:31.010 --> 31:39.799
See, I was involved with the US Livestock Sanitary 
Association on their foreign animal disease

31:31.010 --> 31:39.799
committee on their infectious diseases of 
horses. And during that same time period, I was on

31:41.400 --> 31:49.488
the research committee of the American 
Veterinary Medical Association and chairman of

31:41.400 --> 31:49.488
that committee for several years. And also, many 
of these foreign trips were sponsored by agencies

31:56.643 --> 32:00.471
other than USAID or Rockefeller. There were 
several of them sponsored by National Academy of

32:00.491 --> 32:06.684
Science that were interested in these things. And 
for example...
