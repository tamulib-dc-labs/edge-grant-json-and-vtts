WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:15.237
And so it was, back then the core voted in such a 
block anyway that it would have been hard and

00:02.444 --> 00:15.237
civilians didn't come to the polls for some 
reason. And, but that allowed me to cut into a lot of

00:15.257 --> 00:24.987
the civilian student body vote and as a result of it 
kind of. Now we'll get back to that year as student

00:25.007 --> 00:27.650
body president. Let's go back to academics. 
you're in class, what did you and your buddies

00:29.900 --> 00:40.349
think was the, were the guidelines for class 
attendance and conduct and so forth? Oh, gosh, you

00:41.990 --> 00:51.058
know, the first couple years, we all thought, boy, 
you got to be there every time or the devil will

00:41.990 --> 00:51.058
swoop down on you and haul you off. By the time we 
were juniors, we kind of got the impression, you

00:51.098 --> 00:59.485
don't necessarily have to be at every one of them if 
you have somebody else that can help you take notes

00:59.752 --> 01:01.695
and stuff like that. But for the first couple 
years, I mean, I think attendance was pretty

01:03.217 --> 01:07.543
serious. Plus, the folks in your outfit, the 
upperclassmen, grades were then becoming a big

01:07.684 --> 01:14.514
deal. Your outfit could go away if you didn't have 
them and stuff like that. And so they made us study

01:18.840 --> 01:25.049
each night. What about being awake in class? Um... 
Yeah, I never did have too much problem with that.

01:32.123 --> 01:55.560
There was a bunch of dozers, though, guys in the 
Corps that, and maybe I wasn't in an outfit that,

01:32.123 --> 01:55.560
you know, did stuff like that, but we, I mean, 
lights went off at 10 o'clock or something in our

01:32.123 --> 01:55.560
outfit or, you know, like that, so we didn't have 
too much trouble with that, but there were, I

01:32.123 --> 01:55.560
remember there were a lot of professors upset, 
particularly with fish in the Corps who seemed to

01:56.047 --> 02:07.403
be snoring a little bit in class, particularly the 
big classes like biology, zoology, and places

01:56.047 --> 02:07.403
like that where they might have, it seemed to me, 
four or five hundred kids in it. Did you, in the

02:07.444 --> 02:12.451
first year or two, did you have any courses that 
were really tough to pass? Everybody thought

02:14.734 --> 02:18.419
English was a tough course. I never thought 
English was a very tough course. I don't know. I

02:25.329 --> 02:25.750
thought I was horrible at math. I had to do the 
remedial deal and the whole bit. Which I'm sure is

02:32.308 --> 02:36.685
why I became the chief financial officer of the 
state of Texas. I learned to hire good math people.

02:41.429 --> 02:44.373
But math was real hard for me. That's why I'm glad I 
went into political science instead of something

02:44.413 --> 02:50.180
that required an awful lot of math. So I worked real 
hard to steer clear of math and chemistry and stuff

02:50.220 --> 02:55.286
like that. Foreign languages were tough for me. 
When I discovered that I had to have four semesters

02:58.590 --> 03:05.558
of foreign language, I went into a Spanish class 
and everybody there was named Rodriguez, and I

03:05.774 --> 03:09.139
said, this ain't the place for me. And so I went in a 
French class, and everybody there was named

03:09.179 --> 03:14.948
Dubois, and I said, that's not the place for me. And 
I walked into a Russian class, and I thought,

03:14.988 --> 03:26.946
there's only one guy here named George Zaychevsky 
that can speak this stuff. I'm starting on the same

03:26.986 --> 03:30.993
level as everybody else, and so I did. The lucky 
thing for me At the end of the first class period,

03:34.546 --> 03:43.279
the professor, his name was John Skravanek, and he 
was asking everybody, he said, you know, where are

03:34.546 --> 03:43.279
you from and all this kind of stuff. And it's a true 
story. This sounds unbelievable. But it's the

03:46.263 --> 03:48.386
reason I stayed in the class. He asked me, he said, 
where are you from? And I said, I'm from Placido,

03:50.249 --> 03:51.811
Texas. He said, Placido, Texas? Where is that? He 
said, that's in Victoria County, isn't it? And I

03:56.719 --> 03:57.900
said, that's amazing. You know where Placido, 
Texas is? And he said, listen, when I was at the

03:59.642 --> 04:09.791
University of Texas teaching Czech, and he taught 
that here too, the best student I ever had in my life

03:59.642 --> 04:09.791
was from Placido, Texas. And I said, really? 
That's amazing. He said, what was his name? He

04:14.075 --> 04:14.895
said, it was a her. I said, well, what was her name? 
He said, Venus Mark. And I said, that's my mother.

04:19.579 --> 04:21.041
It's a true story. I said, you've got to be kidding 
me. And I tell him, he said, that's your mother? I

04:25.307 --> 04:26.629
said, yeah, Venus Marks. She married Melbourne 
Sharp, and I'm her youngest son. And he said, that

04:31.398 --> 04:33.201
is absolutely amazing. Let's go call your mother. 
So we go over there, and we call mom and said, mom,

04:34.784 --> 04:38.691
who is your Czech teacher? at the University of 
Texas, and you better get this right." And she

04:41.295 --> 04:44.521
said, oh, Dr. John Skravanek, he was a great 
teacher. Of course, mother spoke Czech before she

04:44.882 --> 04:48.309
spoke English. And he gets on the phone and all this 
kind of stuff, and so I'm thinking I had a little

04:48.329 --> 04:54.762
help as I wormed my way through Russian. And 
probably your second year, you had Gary Halter.

05:01.216 --> 05:04.179
What made him special in your academic life? Oh, 
because Gary just loved politics and he loved to

05:04.199 --> 05:11.487
talk about politics and he loved to talk about it in 
class and outside of class. I wrote a paper one time

05:11.627 --> 05:25.983
and they asked us to talk about, I guess Watergate 
maybe was going on that particular time, and they

05:11.627 --> 05:25.983
asked us to analyze a political figure and I wrote 
this paper. I hope I've lost it by now. comparing

05:28.233 --> 05:34.261
Nixon to Hitler, and I found striking 
similarities. That raised Halter's eyebrows a

05:34.281 --> 05:39.728
little bit, but, you know, I don't know. And you 
turned to, what kind of advice did he give you? It

05:42.331 --> 05:50.742
wasn't about politics, but he just, he gives me 
much more political advice now on things. But then

05:51.162 --> 05:57.210
he talked about, we didn't talk about careers 
because I don't think any of us were thinking about

05:57.882 --> 06:04.949
running for stuff back then, although it's 
amazing how that group all did. I guess we couldn't

06:04.969 --> 06:07.972
get jobs in the private sector. But he would talk to 
me about courses that he thought were interesting

06:08.713 --> 06:20.605
and stuff like that, and we'd talk about politics 
some, but just in terms of what was existing that

06:08.713 --> 06:20.605
particular day. I don't think we talked about, 
hey, when you get out of school, you ought to think

06:26.722 --> 06:29.225
about this or that, or run for something. If you 
were wondering what courses to take, I'd always go

06:29.365 --> 06:33.029
to him. You'd go to him. And as you look back, his 
advice was good advice. Yeah, I think good advice.

06:40.798 --> 06:41.538
He helped me a lot. How was it better to be a 
sophomore at A&M than to be a freshman? Whoa, whoa,

06:45.463 --> 06:47.705
in the Corps, it was just night and day. I mean, you 
know, granted you weren't out of the woods yet, but

06:52.237 --> 06:57.876
and the pressure to me, I mean some of the kids would 
say, It's the physical stuff, but the mental

06:58.497 --> 07:07.009
stuff, I just never got used to anybody screaming 
at me and telling me what a lowlife I was and all this

06:58.497 --> 07:07.009
kind of stuff. It wasn't until years later that you 
kind of look back and appreciate what that was. I'm

07:12.397 --> 07:13.419
not sure the people doing it. It's just in the 
system and it takes you, it really strips you of

07:13.499 --> 07:23.053
your pride and everything else and then you have to 
kind of build it back as you're as you're doing that

07:23.523 --> 07:25.506
with other folks. But the sophomore year was 
remarkably different. The junior year, I

07:28.471 --> 07:46.020
remember the feeling of taking my shoes off and 
walking on grass my senior year and thinking what

07:28.471 --> 07:46.020
an amazing feeling this is to be able to walk on 
something other than cement.

07:47.080 --> 07:53.548
Were there, in those days, were there any easy 
courses that were kind of legendary for making

07:47.080 --> 07:53.548
grades? Yeah, there were some jock courses. You 
had to figure out which ones the jocks took. And I

07:59.877 --> 08:02.400
never did a very good job of figuring those out. I 
just heard about them. But apparently there were

08:03.481 --> 08:14.535
some, at the time there were some economics 
courses and a couple other things that football

08:03.481 --> 08:14.535
players at the time knew which ones to take. I got in 
one of those. one time, which I thought was kind

08:16.139 --> 08:19.222
of... Did it turn out to be an easy? It turned out to 
be pretty easy. Yeah. At the final exam, the

08:24.568 --> 08:28.472
professor left and locked the door. I thought that 
was kind of interesting. I'm sitting back here

08:31.875 --> 08:35.539
thinking, this guy's got video cameras. You guys 
better quit doing all this stuff. I never partook

08:37.661 --> 08:43.106
in it because I thought it was a sting operation or 
something like that. It wasn't. Were there any

08:44.624 --> 08:53.332
courses that were supposedly highly respected 
that you and your colleagues heard about, hey,

08:44.624 --> 08:53.332
this is a course you ought to take? Yeah. That was an 
option for us? Yeah. Yeah. Some economics

08:59.777 --> 09:00.898
courses. A guy named Ashcroft. Ashcroft was 
history. Was it history? Ashcroft was history?

09:09.206 --> 09:10.647
Yeah. Well, it wasn't Graham. I know Graham thinks 
that I took a course under him, but I never did have

09:14.459 --> 09:17.283
that. I didn't know Phil until after I'd already 
graduated. But there was some economics course. I

09:22.990 --> 09:24.632
guess I can't remember who the professor was. As 
you look back on your four years here... And there

09:25.593 --> 09:33.042
was a literary course, Great Books it was called, 
that I thought was exceptional. Somebody told me

09:33.062 --> 09:34.043
it was. It was really good. Do you remember who? I 
don't remember. It was a lady. As you look back, who

09:38.409 --> 09:42.694
were the celebrity students while you were here? 
Oh, gosh. Well, when I was a freshman, when I was a

09:47.027 --> 09:54.055
fish, it was Hector Gutierrez. I mean, he was 
commander of the Corps, and he carried himself

09:54.916 --> 10:01.764
like he was commander of the Corps. And I remember 
him kind of walking along with his four diamonds,

10:02.124 --> 10:08.732
and everybody pretty much thought that's either 
God or right-hand aid, you know, to him or

10:09.033 --> 10:12.156
something like that, so. Did you all become 
acquainted? No. Didn't know him at all. I was just a

10:15.920 --> 10:17.421
fish in the Corps. We're good friends now, but I 
didn't, I didn't know him at all. Was the fact that

10:20.704 --> 10:26.850
he was Hispanic and Corps Commander, did the, the 
fact that he was Minard, did that matter to

10:20.704 --> 10:26.850
anybody? Uh, I don't, that wouldn't have 
registered on me because the class I came from was

10:29.072 --> 10:38.061
90 percent, you know, the high school and grade 
school I came from was a majority Hispanic and so it

10:38.834 --> 10:50.407
wouldn't have... Like what little I know about the 
way things were done then, I had the impression

10:38.834 --> 10:50.407
that Hector was selected for one reason, that he 
was the best. The fact he was Hispanic was totally

10:50.567 --> 10:53.170
coincidental. Yeah, I think that's probably 
right. It was probably true of Henry the year

10:54.792 --> 10:57.415
before. I didn't know Cisneros because he 
graduated in May of 68 and was a White House fellow

10:57.515 --> 11:05.525
and I came in the fall of 68. So I didn't know Henry 
until years later. other celebrity students in

11:07.994 --> 11:10.436
your four years? Oh, in the whole four years? Well, 
I don't know.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.148
Lane Cruz was one. He was a class below me. He was a 
Rhodes Scholar. And he kind of followed me on

11:25.952 --> 11:29.456
everything political. He was the student life 
chairman after I was and became the student body

11:29.536 --> 11:35.402
president after me. Literally almost ran for 
everything that I ran. We were real close friends.

11:39.961 --> 11:49.314
And so you actually had a group of folks there that 
sometimes were on opposite sides. Caperton

11:50.095 --> 11:52.378
started this deal called the Fifth Wheel. And I was 
one of the few, me and a guy named Nick Jigger, were

11:53.399 --> 12:02.312
the only two Corps members that were in that deal. 
And some of my friends in the Corps didn't like that

12:02.332 --> 12:04.815
deal. that very much wound up to be a pretty good 
deal when I was a senior because I met a lot of

12:04.913 --> 12:16.358
civilian students and as well as people in the 
Corps. So you had, gosh you had, in that student

12:17.317 --> 12:27.778
senate, my junior and senior year, you had Jerry 
Geisweit, who became a state representative from

12:17.317 --> 12:27.778
Mason. You had

12:28.800 --> 12:35.393
Kent Caperton, who became a state senator from 
Bryan. He had Gary Morrow, who became land

12:35.963 --> 12:45.072
commissioner for 16 years or however long he was. 
Chet wasn't here yet, was he? Who's that? Chet

12:46.974 --> 12:47.574
Edwards. Chet, sure was. He was a class below me. 
But Chet was in the Student Senate, but became real

12:51.198 --> 12:55.261
big in Skona. Chet did his doing the MSC, and I would 
have named Chet. Hackney was a member of the

13:01.848 --> 13:05.211
Student Senate, became a state representative 
from From Houston, Perry became a state

13:05.731 --> 13:14.086
representative from Haskell, then Land 
Commissioner, then Lieutenant Governor.

13:16.831 --> 13:18.094
There's a bunch more. What was the stimulus? I 
don't know. I don't think any of us have ever been

13:21.360 --> 13:23.544
able to figure it out. If you look at before that 
class, that two or three year group of people, you

13:30.301 --> 13:35.507
can count the number of people, the number of 
Aggies that were in the Texas legislature on your

13:30.301 --> 13:35.507
fingers. I mean, there's just Bill Moore, Peyton 
McKnight, Babe Swartz, and kind of Dick Slack. I

13:41.373 --> 13:42.434
mean, just every now and then. But all of a sudden, 
but that particular class, it's like everybody

13:42.474 --> 13:50.683
that was in the student senate went home and ran for 
something and got elected. Now, does Wayne Stark

13:51.104 --> 13:54.267
deserve any credit for some of that? He certainly 
did with Chet. He was real close to Chet and real

13:58.552 --> 14:02.979
close to Randy Ross and folks like that. He was a 
good friend of mine, but Wayne didn't much advise

14:03.880 --> 14:11.611
the Senate so much as he did the MSC. I was in a bunch 
of those clubs in the MSC, but I never went that way

14:12.453 --> 14:22.267
like Kirk Hawkins did and some of those guys with 
the MSC. Wayne... I went on a trip that Wayne asked

14:25.280 --> 14:27.645
me to go to one time. It was a skiing trip. One 
winter, 300 of us went to Chamonix, France. But on

14:34.037 --> 14:38.466
the way over, six of us in the back of the plane 
gathered. Apparently, there were just six of us

14:38.827 --> 14:43.997
that had never seen snow since the seventh grade, 
much less skied on it. And so we decided that we're

14:44.602 --> 14:54.553
going to land in Geneva, and we're going to rent a 
car, and we're going to go touring Europe for eight

14:44.602 --> 14:54.553
days, and we'll meet you guys back here when you got 
back. And we barely made it back in time, and the

14:54.594 --> 15:02.863
plane was fueled, ready to go, and they were going 
to give us another 15 minutes, and we finally

14:54.594 --> 15:02.863
straggled in. We ran out of money about halfway 
through our trip, so we were sleeping in culverts

15:02.883 --> 15:07.609
before it was over with. But Wayne had a big 
influence on lots of kids, I don't think any of us

15:14.369 --> 15:24.384
can explain what it was about that group that got 
into politics.

15:25.446 --> 15:25.966
Let's see. MSC during your four years. What was the 
MSC? What role did it play on the campus? It was a

15:33.998 --> 15:36.302
huge role. I think one of the reasons that you have 
the kind of spirit participation, leadership

15:41.200 --> 15:45.504
training, stuff like that. One of the reasons that 
kids come out is that the MSC here has always been so

15:45.544 --> 15:54.513
much bigger than at any other university. It's not 
just a place to go bowling. I mean, there are

15:56.995 --> 16:05.883
hundreds and hundreds of organizations, as you 
know, that these kids can join and apply

15:56.995 --> 16:05.883
leadership skills to those organizations and 
stuff. And so I've

16:05.903 --> 16:10.768
tried to analyze what it is that one of the things 
that makes Aggies more successful. I mean

16:16.390 --> 16:20.479
obviously one of them is Aggies hire Aggies. I mean 
I'm very guilty of that. I mean I don't know if I ever

16:23.205 --> 16:26.192
had an Aggie apply for a job at the controller of 
public accounts that isn't working at the

16:26.678 --> 16:30.943
controller of public accounts. And I did it, of 
course, on merit. And it got a little, I mean,

16:33.506 --> 16:42.296
almost to the point of embarrassment sometimes, 
because people would write me letters saying, the

16:33.506 --> 16:42.296
only reason I didn't get this job is I didn't have a 
ring. And, you know, because of open record stuff,

16:43.537 --> 16:48.383
I wouldn't write back and say, yes, that's true. 
But I think the core coupled with the MSC and so many

16:48.953 --> 17:05.267
places for kids to become involved and apply 
leadership skills and learn things like that is

16:48.953 --> 17:05.267
one of the reasons that kids do so well. I think the 
MSC is the second academics. It's a big part of the

17:08.129 --> 17:11.352
leadership training. Did you ever get one of Wayne 
Stark's special lectures, particularly the

17:11.372 --> 17:16.737
green couch treatment? Mm-mm. Do you know what I 
mean by the green couch? Uh-uh. Oh, that one, for

17:21.025 --> 17:29.818
those that he thought had high capability 
potential but then started goofing off, he

17:21.025 --> 17:29.818
invited you down. Remember his office was down at 
the end of the hallway? At the end of the hallway. It

17:32.381 --> 17:34.585
had that sleazy-looking green vinyl-covered 
couch. He would invite you in by yourself, close

17:35.626 --> 17:39.932
the door, and put you on that couch. And when you got 
through hearing the lecture he gave you, you never

17:41.875 --> 17:46.141
forgot it. And what it really was, he would say, 
shame on you. You can do better, and you know you

17:49.265 --> 17:51.047
can. Not long ago, I was asking this in a group of 
people of your vintage and older and some of

17:52.269 --> 18:09.091
today's students, and when I asked, did he ever try 
the green couch treatment on you, three or four of

17:52.269 --> 18:09.091
today's co-eds gasped because they thought I was 
referring to some other kind of treatment. No, no,

18:09.131 --> 18:11.294
no, no, no, no, no. No, I never got that one. I 
would... I'd go down... My office was... kind of

18:18.172 --> 18:28.045
down the stairs past the desk down there where the 
student president's office was and I'd go down

18:18.172 --> 18:28.045
there and shoot the breeze with Wayne and that's 
not a five minute deal. That's right, that's

18:28.105 --> 18:29.387
right. And talk to him and stuff like that, but I 
wasn't in, my niche wasn't in the MSC governance

18:29.407 --> 18:38.720
part of it, it was in the student senate part of it. A 
tiny little thing about MSC, where did you and your

18:38.740 --> 18:43.346
buddies go for a break during the day? MSC, the only 
place to go. Yeah, went in there and it was a good

18:47.922 --> 18:51.606
hiding place for freshmen. Go sit in those couches 
and stuff like that. It was kind of a standing room.

18:56.111 --> 18:59.856
Nobody mess with you in the Memorial Student 
Center and stuff like that.

19:02.639 --> 19:04.001
Were you part of SCONA? You weren't, were you? No, I 
went to just to, I didn't do any organizing for it. I

19:09.427 --> 19:15.073
went to some of the meetings and, you know, helped 
get speakers and stuff like that, but that was it.

19:15.093 --> 19:15.634
That's your phone. Oh, no. Oh, I thought I heard it. 
Let's see, YMCA was nothing in terms of importance

19:19.212 --> 19:25.682
during your year, was it? Because before MSCC, the 
YMCA... Yeah, no, it had, it coordinated fish

19:26.042 --> 19:33.234
camp, that's the best I could tell. Did you ever get 
sick and go to the quack shack, the hospital? Yeah.

19:37.701 --> 19:40.525
What was it like, describe the quack shack? Oh, 
man, it was appropriately named. I think my senior

19:43.095 --> 19:50.662
year they built a new one, but before that it was, 
you come out a lot sicker than you went in. It was a

19:50.782 --> 19:53.385
pretty depressing little place. I hurt myself in 
rugby, and that was the only time that I went there.

19:56.928 --> 20:02.313
My junior year I was on the rugby team, and I don't 
know what I did. I cracked some vertebrae or

20:02.393 --> 20:08.318
something in my neck or something like that, and 
after I went to the I was walking when I went into

20:08.585 --> 20:10.648
Quack Shack. When I came out of Quack Shack, I had to 
call my dad and say, you gotta get me to Victoria.

20:16.517 --> 20:19.381
And I was out of school for a week and went down 
there. I'm sure it wasn't anything that Quack

20:21.985 --> 20:25.109
Shack did, but they damn sure didn't do anything to 
help it. It was located up near the... Yeah, it was

20:26.331 --> 20:31.538
down here kind of across from Sabeasa or somewhere 
in here.

20:34.923 --> 20:38.068
Was there a full-time campus doctor or do you 
remember? I don't think I ever saw a doctor in

20:39.162 --> 20:40.785
there. There was a couple of nurses and stuff. 
Let's see. Gine Hall was demolished during your

20:45.472 --> 20:50.079
student days. Well, I saw the first ball hit Gine 
Hall. Really? I watched it happen. There was a big

20:55.307 --> 20:56.870
fence around it. That's where the speech classes 
were. The guy that announced the football games,

20:59.113 --> 21:01.316
what was his name? Oh, oh. Good afternoon, 
football fans. Welcome to Kyle Field, home of the

21:07.095 --> 21:10.201
fighting Texas Aggies. I took a couple of speech 
courses from him. Eastern accent. Yeah. That's

21:17.535 --> 21:25.150
where his offices were in the back of that, but 
there was a big fence around it, and they had to

21:17.535 --> 21:25.150
demolish Guy Hall, I guess, to make room for Rudder 
Tower. and it was a big deal. They said at 10 o'clock

21:27.353 --> 21:31.039
in the morning the first ball is going to hit Gine 
Hall. They'd already taken some bricks off and I

21:31.059 --> 21:38.711
think they had sold them or something and that 
wrecking ball just went pow and we watched the

21:31.059 --> 21:38.711
first one hit.

21:42.958 --> 21:47.204
The student body, when you were here, describe the 
student body in general. Attitudes, background,

21:47.264 --> 21:51.711
and so forth.

21:53.952 --> 21:59.680
Well, let me describe it in terms of campus 
politics because that's what I knew best, I guess.

21:59.720 --> 22:16.483
But you had a, in campus politics, you had a natural 
alliance

21:59.720 --> 22:16.483
between the core, Walton Hall, Hart Hall, Fowler 
to some extent, some of those old halls. And it all

22:17.324 --> 22:25.835
hinged around the bonfire because there were 
certain dormitories that just bore, you know,

22:17.324 --> 22:25.835
civilian dormitories that are hell-bent for 
leather. Boy, they have real serious roles. And

22:28.218 --> 22:29.840
whether that's true now, I don't know. But it was 
certainly true back then. And so you had, because

22:31.862 --> 22:47.061
of that once-a-year deal, you had outfits in the 
Corps that were closely aligned with Walton Hall

22:31.862 --> 22:47.061
or closely aligned with Hart Hall and some of 
those.

22:48.121 --> 22:56.572
The student body,

22:48.121 --> 22:56.572
even back then, was just starting to become urban 
and suburban. I would say the core was still very

22:57.293 --> 23:03.902
rural, certainly in my dormitory it was. If they 
were from the cities, they were from San Antonio.

23:09.249 --> 23:12.633
Liberal, conservative, and basically... Oh, 
conservative. Against McGovern, Nixon got 89% of

23:13.514 --> 23:16.558
the campus vote. Very conservative. Their 
values. I remember Jerry Geisweier gave a speech

23:20.878 --> 23:28.028
one time in the middle, well, let me give you an idea 
of how conservative this student body was. Kent

23:29.750 --> 23:40.024
State, the student senate was not debating 
whether or not to fly the half, to flag half staff as

23:29.750 --> 23:40.024
other universities were for the students killed 
at Kent State. They were debating whether or not to

23:41.046 --> 23:46.393
fly the flag at half staff for the National 
Guardman that was wounded. There was no sentiment

23:47.757 --> 23:55.868
in the Student Senate to fly the half-staff for 
those commie pinkos in Kent State. I mean, that was

23:55.888 --> 23:57.571
the attitude. And during that time, when there was 
turmoil in the late 60s, early 70s on other

23:57.591 --> 24:13.933
campuses, primarily the Vietnam War, Jerry 
Goswine, who was student vice president at the

23:57.591 --> 24:13.933
time, got up and gave a speech at a Mother's Day 
crowd And I remember he called A&M the last bastion

24:15.280 --> 24:19.666
of sanity. And Geisweit got more press off that 
worldwide than anybody could imagine. Of course,

24:26.216 --> 24:31.664
the former students in the administration, Dean 
Hannigan in particular, he thought that was the

24:26.216 --> 24:31.664
best thing in the world. But that was Geisweit's 
claim to glory. The way Geisweit got to be student

24:33.988 --> 24:40.377
body president is Gary Morrow ran for student body 
president against Al Reiner. Al Reinert, who

24:41.504 --> 24:45.769
wrote this screenplay for Apollo 13. Al, grades 
were bad, and they didn't find out until later. And

24:50.814 --> 24:57.541
so rather than make Gary student body president, 
they just nullified the election. The election

24:57.601 --> 24:59.443
commission was controlled by the Corps. Geisweit 
had won vice president, so they put Geisweit up

25:00.344 --> 25:03.688
against Morrow. Geisweit beat Morrow for student 
body president, and that's how he became student

25:04.068 --> 25:08.693
president. Because Ryder won the election. He won 
the election. He was on core staff. He was a junior

25:14.960 --> 25:16.081
on core staff. All right, let's see. What about 
their attitude about hard work? Hard work? The

25:22.729 --> 25:23.850
student body. Yeah, I think they all kind of came 
with that. I mean, it was... Geographic origin.

25:29.436 --> 25:30.718
You said they're small town. Lots of small town. 
Income level, family income. Couldn't have been

25:35.483 --> 25:36.604
very high. diversity as we now use that term? Hey, 
we're working hard at it, but it wasn't very. I

25:42.418 --> 25:56.098
mean, I know in, I know there

25:42.418 --> 25:56.098
were very few Hispanics, very few blacks in the 
Corps or on campus. There were a lot of Asian kids.

26:00.164 --> 26:05.612
Remember there were a couple of dormitories of 
Asian kids, but most of them were from overseas uh

26:05.947 --> 26:34.603
hotard hall several halls like that but but um 
there were there weren't uh too many that they kind

26:05.947 --> 26:34.603
of started working on that i think about my junior 
or senior year the student government was heavily

26:05.947 --> 26:34.603
involved in prayer do you remember there was a 
bunch of debate um morrow in particular and a guy

26:05.947 --> 26:34.603
named ken windler and austin are all trying to get 
the a m board to give more money to prairie view that

26:05.947 --> 26:34.603
was kind of a cause for the for the few liberals that 
were on campus, you know. But it, and that later on

26:38.610 --> 26:45.902
in the legislature got them in trouble. 
Wilhelmina Delco really started taking them to

26:45.982 --> 26:52.051
task, but you talk about done good. I mean, I think 
even Wilhelmina will say now that A&M is better in

26:52.071 --> 26:59.022
that regard than virtually any university you can 
name in the state of Texas. Do you remember any

26:59.542 --> 27:12.815
incidents in the dormitories or in the hallways of 
the classroom buildings involving ethnicity and

26:59.542 --> 27:12.815
or a woman student?

27:13.275 --> 27:14.697
Women students. Such as? Well, I mean, stuff that 
you would never tolerate now. I mean, when a woman

27:19.261 --> 27:28.570
walked in the quadrangle of the core between 1968 
and 1972, that was a major event. very closely

27:29.258 --> 27:31.281
linked to the Second Coming. And people would 
scream and holler and... But was it a holler of

27:36.006 --> 27:39.531
approval or disapproval? I suppose it's how she 
took it. Oh, no, it was like, look at this. You

27:45.398 --> 27:47.361
haven't seen one of these in a while. All this kind 
of stuff. But, yeah, I'm talking about not just

27:48.943 --> 27:54.410
women students walking on. I'm talking about any 
woman that walks down there. I'm sure that doesn't

27:57.592 --> 27:59.814
happen now. If it did now, it would be, but it was 
just such a rare event. I mean, women, when I

28:05.320 --> 28:17.493
graduated, there were 700 women, more than half of 
which were married, and about 14,000 students,

28:05.320 --> 28:17.493
something like that. Am I correct in saying to 
people that black students, Hispanic students,

28:18.414 --> 28:25.422
minorities of all sorts, had almost no problems 
here. No. I think you are correct in that regard

28:29.750 --> 28:47.730
except on San Jacinto Day and Pearl Harbor Day 
because in Pearl Harbor Day I remember they would

28:29.750 --> 28:47.730
go get every Asian student in the Corps and dump 
them in a whole groat hole somewhere Even if they

28:48.436 --> 28:51.621
were not Japanese, American? Well, it doesn't 
matter. Anywhere close. And everybody laughed

28:54.987 --> 28:57.191
about it, including them. They all thought that 
was... And then the Hispanics on San Jacinto Day?

29:00.576 --> 29:00.917
Oh, yeah. Yeah, or anything like that. Or some day 
like that.

29:09.243 --> 29:17.670
I imagine if school had been going on on June the 
16th or 19th, they would have had the same thing

29:09.243 --> 29:17.670
there. That's the only thing I can remember. They 
may get carried away and find some Bohemian

29:21.914 --> 29:30.862
holiday and get all of us who are Czech orientation 
looking for an excuse to do it. I think that is an

29:30.942 --> 29:33.804
accurate statement. There weren't very many, but 
the black and Hispanic and minority kids nobody

29:38.842 --> 29:42.465
saw the difference. Maybe one of the reasons for 
that is when you're going through that hell your

29:42.485 --> 29:51.874
first semester of your freshman year, the last 
thing you want to worry about is what color or

29:42.485 --> 29:51.874
background some guy has. You're just trying to 
survive this thing and generally the black guy

29:51.894 --> 29:56.458
next to you is trying to survive too. Is that the key 
to understanding the Aggie mentality that you're

29:57.019 --> 30:05.667
either an Aggie or you're not and if you are that's 
all that matters? I think so. It does. All those old

30:08.637 --> 30:14.646
former students had told us when we were students 
that this will carry on afterward. It does. So your

30:17.110 --> 30:23.780
mother was a Czech ancestry, so what?

30:24.481 --> 30:30.330
From the point of view that I've come from, and that 
is the core, I think probably the army or war or

30:30.817 --> 30:55.795
things like that are the same as once you go through 
it together it doesn't much matter I remember when

30:30.817 --> 30:55.795
the war was over with my father you know talked 
about two Hispanic guys can't remember their name

30:30.817 --> 30:55.795
that when he was wounded ran out and pulled him out 
of the field of fire and he said oh you'll never hear

30:30.817 --> 30:55.795
me say anything bad about about a a 
Mexican-American because it wouldn't be here if

30:56.770 --> 30:59.633
there weren't for those two. Let's see, in terms of 
the student body makeup, what about wheels? Who

31:03.858 --> 31:05.701
had a car and what kind of cars? Oh, we had one kid 
named K.T. Alexander from Louisiana whose family

31:10.426 --> 31:16.093
had money. He stayed a year and decided that the LSU 
fraternity was where he wanted to be but he had a

31:17.434 --> 31:22.841
car. There were very few kids I'm trying to think if 
we were allowed cars. I think freshmen were, but

31:27.954 --> 31:30.970
there was a fish parking lot. Now, there were some 
kids that had cars. There just wasn't anybody.
