00:10.510 --> 00:18.201
Okay, this is Ron Shorn at the Berkeley American 
Astronomical Society meeting, June 10th, 1993,

00:10.510 --> 00:18.201
and I'm talking with Brad Smith. Brad, for the 
record, would you give your full name? Bradford A.

00:20.845 --> 00:22.568
Smith. Okay, when did you get into planetary 
astronomy? 1955.

00:31.782 --> 00:34.746
Okay, and where and doing what? I was in the Army and 
assigned to work with Clyde Tombaugh at Lowell

00:35.333 --> 00:48.284
Observatory in what was then the New Mexico 
College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts.

00:49.645 --> 01:04.598
Tombaugh was conducting a search for 
earth-orbiting

00:49.645 --> 01:04.598
satellites, small earth-orbiting satellites, 
and the Army Map Service, specifically John

00:49.645 --> 01:04.598
O'Keefe, sent me to to the southwest to work with 
Tombaugh.

01:10.630 --> 01:26.772
When you first broke into the racket, were you 
aware of any bias against the planetary solar

01:10.630 --> 01:26.772
system work on the part of real astronomers, say, 
for example, people that work on galaxies or stars

01:10.630 --> 01:26.772
and mountains and various other places? Hey, I 
started off with Tombaugh. I was thrown into the

01:28.475 --> 01:31.699
bias issue right at the very beginning. and had 
other contacts with Kuiper. So I was very familiar

01:35.893 --> 01:42.742
with the bias against so-called planetary 
astronomy. Do you think any of that had to do with

01:42.762 --> 01:46.708
the fact that there was kind of an instrumental 
barrier? Namely, infrared detectors were junk,

01:46.748 --> 01:50.413
and that's where the spectral information was. 
Photometry was pretty poor to get any information

01:50.473 --> 01:55.119
out of that. Or was it personal? Or was it Percival 
Lowell? Or was it a combination? I think people

01:59.523 --> 02:10.204
like Lowell probably had some effect on this 
attitude, but the attitude seemed to be a fairly

01:59.523 --> 02:10.204
general one. That is, people who study the planets 
just aren't doing serious astronomy. By the way,

02:15.715 --> 02:19.523
those tendencies continue today. Many 
astronomers feel that if you're not doing

02:20.178 --> 02:31.129
cosmological extragalactic astronomy and just 
playing around our own galaxy, you're not doing

02:20.178 --> 02:31.129
serious astronomy. So these things just come 
about depending upon what's in vogue at the time.

02:37.656 --> 02:40.479
Do you think planetary astronomy is astronomy? Of 
course it's astronomy. Do you think the general

02:41.981 --> 02:45.104
public thinks planetary astronomy is astronomy? 
Very definitely. When did you first cross paths

02:47.212 --> 02:52.320
with NSA? With NASA? When they were created. In 
what way? Tombo and I both had proposals and we were

02:58.770 --> 03:13.793
funded very early on, I guess among the very first 
NASA grants that were provided by the fledgling

02:58.770 --> 03:13.793
NASA. Do you remember what that was for? Yeah, I can 
remember what some of them were for. We had, both

03:22.717 --> 03:42.641
Tombo and I, had come to the conclusion, I'm sure 
others as well, that the planetary work that was

03:22.717 --> 03:42.641
being done at Lowell and Lick and various other 
places, they tend to concentrate on taking

03:22.717 --> 03:42.641
observations, photographs, when everything was 
just right. You know, a close Mars opposition,

03:42.782 --> 03:46.446
when Jupiter was in opposition. And I wanted to get 
involved in synoptic observations, to look at the

03:47.084 --> 03:59.080
planets every night, whether it was good seeing or 
bad seeing, whether it was close to opposition or

03:47.084 --> 03:59.080
far. And so we put in a proposal to do this using a 
telescope that was left over from Tombaugh's

04:00.441 --> 04:08.712
satellite search program. That was the basis of 
the original support from NASA. Where do you think

04:14.422 --> 04:20.872
planetary astronomy would be today without the 
money that NASA has spent on it in the last 30 years?

04:22.655 --> 04:24.137
Well, that's a little hard to judge. I mean, after 
all, if NASA were to stop their support right now,

04:24.177 --> 04:42.505
there would be a real hiatus in ground-based 
planetary astronomy because the NSF doesn't have

04:24.177 --> 04:42.505
a recent history of supporting planetary 
astronomy. I really don't know. Planets became

04:45.153 --> 04:52.863
more important as the technology developed to 
study them. And if there had been no NASA, I would

04:53.023 --> 05:01.615
guess that at some level, the NSF would have 
provided support for studies of planets. But

05:01.655 --> 05:11.648
without question, it was boosted by NASA's need to 
have ground-based support for their flight

05:01.655 --> 05:11.648
programs. In general, how's your relationship 
been with NASA? In other words, do you have any

05:14.776 --> 05:18.081
compliments, any gripes? No, I've had a very good 
relationship with NASA. Money is always short,

05:24.128 --> 05:27.292
and there's always a fight for funds. And the 
problems become exacerbated when the funding

05:27.453 --> 05:35.283
really drops down as it is right now. But I 
certainly don't have any long-term complaints,

05:36.104 --> 05:40.369
no. Do you think planetary astronomers have done a 
good job of selling themselves to the public and to

05:41.193 --> 05:46.480
Congress? I think they've done an especially good 
job. I know many people in the astrophysics area

05:50.386 --> 06:05.667
who sort of look at solar system astronomers as a 
model for what they should be doing in trying to

05:50.386 --> 06:05.667
promote programs and get support. It's been 30 
years now of modern planetary astronomy, or more.

06:10.623 --> 06:23.539
And both from the ground and from space probes and 
from landings and everything, we haven't found a

06:10.623 --> 06:23.539
single trace of present or past life anywhere in 
the solar system except Earth, and in particular

06:10.623 --> 06:23.539
no little green man on Mars. Do you think that's had 
a negative effect on public support and financial

06:24.701 --> 06:30.268
support for planetary science? I think the public 
fairly quickly forgets the negative results.

06:37.737 --> 06:48.679
Certainly in the post-Viking era, I'm sure there 
was a lot of public disappointment over Viking's

06:37.737 --> 06:48.679
failure to find life on Mars. On the other hand, I 
believe, as do many, that the experiments

06:50.920 --> 06:57.647
designed for carrying out a search for life on Mars 
were not optimized. And at some point, we're going

06:58.068 --> 07:03.233
to go out and do it again and hopefully do it right 
next time. And I think when this program becomes

07:04.835 --> 07:16.067
common knowledge, that once again, you'll see the 
public lining up with great interest to see what

07:04.835 --> 07:16.067
comes out of it. Thirty years ago, if this would be 
an American Astronomical Society, meaning

07:16.807 --> 07:21.292
everybody would be here. Since then, the 
planetary astronomers, among others, have had

07:21.492 --> 07:28.901
their own sub-society, the Division for 
Planetary Sciences. American planetary

07:29.722 --> 07:32.926
astronomers have their own journal now, Icarus. 
Have these developments been good or bad for

07:34.147 --> 07:40.755
planetary astronomy and astronomy in general? I 
think it's been good for both. One sees the

07:44.097 --> 07:55.552
occasional planetary astronomer or planetary 
scientist at the full-up AAS meetings and an

07:44.097 --> 07:55.552
occasional paper sometimes because it's just the 
right time to present it. But getting planetary

07:56.473 --> 08:10.412
astronomers together and getting their own 
publication, I think, has been beneficial both to

07:56.473 --> 08:10.412
the group as a whole and to astronomy in general. 
Where are you now? Where am I now besides sitting

08:12.393 --> 08:15.479
here talking to you? You mean my institutional 
affiliation? Yes, I'm with the Institute for

08:18.103 --> 08:23.032
Astronomy, University of Hawaii. How long have 
you been there? I've been there almost three years

08:24.696 --> 08:28.122
now. Where were you before that? Before that, I was 
at the University of Arizona. I was there for 15

08:32.592 --> 08:34.635
years. From when to when? From 1973, 74, I can't 
remember exactly, until 1990. Okay, and what part

08:42.304 --> 08:45.228
of the University of Arizona? Oh, in the planetary 
sciences department. I also had a joint

08:48.032 --> 08:52.758
appointment within the astronomy department. 
One place that you're associated with, in my mind,

08:53.238 --> 08:57.484
is New Mexico State University. And when did you 
get associated with that? Well, my association

09:01.533 --> 09:08.620
began, actually, when I went to work with Tombaugh 
in 1955. When I got out of the Army in 1957, I elected

09:09.601 --> 09:19.812
to stay on in Massachusetts and spent some time 
working with Tombaugh. At that time, we were

09:20.032 --> 09:23.435
supported by Air Force funds, and they were fairly 
meager. So I spent a little time working with the

09:24.156 --> 09:30.122
rocket facility at the Physical Sciences 
Laboratory. But then shortly after that, NASA

09:30.862 --> 09:40.879
came into existence, funding became available, 
and I went back to doing astronomy again with

09:30.862 --> 09:40.879
Tombaugh. Now, you folks built that up quite a bit. 
How long were you at New Mexico State, and when did

09:43.283 --> 09:45.827
you leave there? I was there for about 17, 18 years 
from, well, as soon as I got out of the Army, 57,

09:46.989 --> 09:57.426
until... So you can see the lift and pick workout, 
right? Yeah, until 1973 or thereabouts. And you

10:05.400 --> 10:08.403
actually built that up to a fairly good-sized 
department, didn't you? We did, yeah. What's

10:10.385 --> 10:11.426
happened to it since? It's still going. There is 
still a fairly strong planetary commitment

10:12.828 --> 10:16.993
there. Rita Beebe pretty much took over for me when 
I left, and as the planetary patrol that we

10:18.134 --> 10:25.742
initiated... back in the mid to late 50s is still 
going and still being supported.

10:34.742 --> 10:39.548
I should have asked you at the beginning, when were 
you born and where? I was born in 1931 in Cambridge,

10:39.568 --> 10:48.220
Massachusetts.

10:48.240 --> 10:53.367
What do you think is the most important piece of 
work in planetary astronomy that you've done? I

10:55.102 --> 11:00.587
mean, either research or building a department or 
preventing a fight or whatever. Well, you know,

11:00.927 --> 11:02.709
it's been a lot of things. I've been in this for a 
long time, really getting old now. I mean, for

11:06.693 --> 11:17.963
example, the planetary patrol that we initiated 
almost

11:06.693 --> 11:17.963
immediately began to produce results just 
because of the synoptic studies. We essentially

11:18.544 --> 11:21.987
co-discovered the... the four-day rotation of 
the high atmosphere winds on Venus. We discovered

11:29.694 --> 11:41.828
the vortical nature, the rotation of the Great Red 
Spot long before it was observed by Pioneer 10.

11:44.951 --> 11:50.978
We

11:44.951 --> 11:50.978
did work on the clouds of Mars and the formation of 
high clouds over the volcanoes. All that was done

11:57.628 --> 12:10.484
from the ground, but since that time I've been 
involved with Mariner 6 and 7, Mariner 9, and

11:57.628 --> 12:10.484
Viking, and finally Voyager. As far as scientific 
accomplishment is concerned, Probably Voyager

12:13.570 --> 12:16.094
just really has to be it. The enormous amount of 
knowledge that came out of that program, the

12:16.134 --> 12:24.086
success of that program, has certainly been a 
highlight in my career. Do you think NASA gives

12:25.047 --> 12:33.199
enough money for long-term data analysis after a 
mission is over and the pretty pictures have

12:25.047 --> 12:33.199
appeared in time? No, that's always been a 
problem. It continues as a problem today. I think

12:37.056 --> 12:44.548
that there are people at NASA who understand this 
problem and are trying desperately to keep the

12:37.056 --> 12:44.548
funding going. And there is an announcement right 
now, for example, for Neptune's, Voyager Neptune

12:45.429 --> 12:51.559
science It's

12:52.265 --> 12:58.651
just one of the first things to go when budget cuts 
come in. You've already gotten the data. And if you

12:59.932 --> 13:04.256
don't analyze it this year, well, theoretically, 
you can do it next year or the year after. One would

13:05.297 --> 13:11.843
hope that that situation, which is already 
improving, will continue to improve. What's the

13:11.863 --> 13:13.805
state of planetary astronomy today?

13:16.588 --> 13:20.972
Planetary astronomy as such is not in very good 
shape, and it's really a result of the success of

13:21.560 --> 13:27.827
the space program. Missions like Mariner, 
Viking, Voyager have learned so much about the

13:29.328 --> 13:45.666
planets that it's difficult to improve on that or 
to add incrementally to it from ground-based

13:29.328 --> 13:45.666
observations. Surely there's a lot of work that 
can be done with small bodies, comets, asteroids,

13:51.766 --> 13:59.863
These new objects that are being observed out in 
the so-called Kuiper Belt are extremely

13:51.766 --> 13:59.863
interesting. And there are still good things that 
can be done from the ground. The monitoring of the

14:04.112 --> 14:11.968
volcanic activity on Hio is an example of that, but 
it's not in the same place that it was back during

14:13.265 --> 14:22.758
the 60s when almost everything you could do with 
new instrumentation was new and discoveries were

14:13.265 --> 14:22.758
being made one right after the other.

14:30.568 --> 14:32.771
Could you give me a little summary of your 
schooling? Yeah, I have a bachelor's degree in

14:33.932 --> 14:39.660
chemical engineering. I got Northeastern 
University in 1954.

14:46.671 --> 14:56.906
I then went into the Army from there to New Mexico 
State and probably set a record for the length of

14:46.671 --> 14:56.906
time anyone has ever spent obtaining a PhD. I 
started taking courses in physics very early on in

14:56.966 --> 15:04.737
the late 50s. And then got much more serious about 
it when the astronomy department was created in

15:05.459 --> 15:11.466
Mexico State. Finally wrote my dissertation and 
got my PhD in 1972. Do you think you talk to other

15:16.132 --> 15:26.064
types of astronomers more than you did, say, 20 
years ago, or about the same, or less? A lot more. A

15:26.925 --> 15:28.427
lot more. In fact, I'm really not doing very much in 
the way of planetary work right now. I've gotten

15:33.112 --> 15:35.415
involved in some other things. I think my 
interests have broadened considerably since I

15:35.615 --> 15:39.280
started. You mentioned that there's still some 
looking down on planetary work. Is there less of

15:45.969 --> 15:50.916
that than there was 20 or 30 years ago or about the 
same? Very, very much less.

15:56.911 --> 16:01.458
quite a number of years on the Telescope 
Allocation Committee at the University of

15:56.911 --> 16:01.458
Arizona. And everybody who has been to Arizona is 
familiar with the arguments and fights that went

16:01.718 --> 16:11.091
on between Kuiper and Bach. I mean, it's 
legendary, the way the two sides of the street

16:11.111 --> 16:16.179
looked at one another. But during the time I spent 
on the TAC, I found that the so-called

16:16.199 --> 16:25.332
astrophysical people, stellar galactic would 
very often speak up and support a proposal to do

16:25.548 --> 16:32.918
planetary work just as much as the planetary 
representatives. I think a lot of that has gone

16:32.978 --> 16:34.540
away. These things still exist. I mentioned the 
cosmologists and the people who really look out to

16:36.923 --> 16:48.939
Hi-Z, kind of looking down on people who still poke 
around with globular clusters in their own galaxy

16:36.923 --> 16:48.939
and so on. I think these things will always exist. 
There's some pecking order that gets established

16:51.042 --> 16:55.167
somewhere.

16:57.458 --> 17:02.548
What has the American taxpayer got out of 
planetary astronomy for the money they put in it?

17:02.568 --> 17:02.988
Knowledge. Do you think it's really had an effect? 
An effect on what? On the way people think about the

17:09.561 --> 17:13.228
universe or themselves or anything? Absolutely 
had an effect on the way people think about the

17:13.248 --> 17:19.720
universe, without question.

17:20.797 --> 17:23.882
I see that in talking to people on airplanes. I 
mean, people really are a lot more savvy than a lot

17:23.922 --> 17:30.131
of the scientists give them credit for, just 
because. And I think NASA deserves an enormous

17:30.832 --> 17:45.855
amount of credit for this, getting information 
out and making it available to the public and

17:30.832 --> 17:45.855
stimulating the production of various 
television series that have gotten the same

17:30.832 --> 17:45.855
information out in the public. It could be a lot 
better, by the way. NASA could... could still

17:48.944 --> 17:55.191
improve its relationship with the education 
system in this country. But I think what they've

17:55.211 --> 18:00.296
accomplished so far has been very useful, very 
effective. On a personal note, when you meet

18:00.317 --> 18:08.065
somebody on an airplane sitting next to them or 
something and tell them you're an astronomer,

18:00.317 --> 18:08.065
what's the reaction you tend to get? Oh, sort of 
awe. Awe that they are actually sitting right next

18:10.968 --> 18:16.234
to an astronomer. Do I spend all my time up on Mauna 
Kea? Few people realize that astronomers spend

18:18.696 --> 18:29.167
less than 10% of their time collecting data and the 
other 90% trying to understand what it was that

18:18.696 --> 18:29.167
they got. But, yeah, it's, wow, you're an 
astronomer. Wow, what's new in the universe? So

18:36.315 --> 18:37.877
it's favorable. Oh, yeah, very, definitely. All 
right, I'll let you.
