WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:07.896
...the oriented support mechanism for 
oceanography. This is ONR now? Yes, sir. It was the

00:11.040 --> 00:15.765
university support for oceanography. Still is 
the major one, except for ship support through

00:15.785 --> 00:20.311
NSF. But then they provided ship time, they 
provided research time. No, it was not mission

00:26.438 --> 00:29.361
oriented. And it really It was knowingly that way. 
It got support from the admiral. Because the

00:35.549 --> 00:40.735
admiral saw, for example, let me tell you a little 
story. When sonar came out,

00:41.315 --> 00:53.888
they ran into immediate problems in submarine use 
of sonar on the continental shelf. And they didn't

00:54.088 --> 00:56.691
know what the dickens it was. It was like a frying 
pan. just crackle, crackle, crackle. And it was

01:00.887 --> 01:04.031
destroying the effectiveness of it. And they 
didn't know what it was. And they put Martin

01:06.293 --> 01:11.880
Johnson on it from Scripps, the guy that I've 
worked with. But that was before I worked with him.

01:14.703 --> 01:18.707
That was during 1940, 41. And he found out it was a 
snapping shrimp. And he found out about the

01:25.074 --> 01:27.717
rhythm, their habits, He told them where they 
might expect them and what would set them off and so

01:27.983 --> 01:33.330
on. So some of the admirals knew that this kind of 
basic research was extremely important to them.

01:45.487 --> 01:56.623
And so at the time, and with the cajoling of Roger 
and perhaps other people that I am unaware of, not

01:45.487 --> 01:56.623
to give him full credit,

01:58.223 --> 02:05.269
decided we don't know where an important finding 
is going to come from. And so this was very

02:06.590 --> 02:14.077
definitely not a mission-oriented group. Do you 
feel that ideally that the major funds for general

02:14.097 --> 02:26.948
scientific research in the sea should come from a 
military affiliated organization such as that,

02:14.097 --> 02:26.948
or should it be a separate Well, let me tell you 
this. I don't know that that part is the important

02:30.286 --> 02:35.592
thing. Here was what was important about ONR and 
may still be. That is that they had a group of

02:41.059 --> 02:53.593
competent people who could judge whether or not 
work that was being done was good work of its kind or

02:41.059 --> 02:53.593
not. If they could put together this small team of 
people who had the executive and administrative

02:53.911 --> 03:09.271
ability and the financial ability, they could put 
together a research program which made sense,

02:53.911 --> 03:09.271
which was coherent. This is more difficult when 
you go to an institution such as NSF, where you've

03:09.291 --> 03:20.425
got a physical oceanography program, you see, and 
you had a biological and a chemical. There is no

03:21.316 --> 03:31.293
doubt that NSF has supported some of the best 
oceanographic work ever done, but not in the way

03:21.316 --> 03:31.293
ONR could do it. They couldn't put together a 
package without making that a big thing. And

03:36.361 --> 03:47.239
that's what I think destroyed some of the work in 
oceanography is that everything went to big

03:36.361 --> 03:47.239
operations, big cooperative ventures. Now, some 
of this is necessary for synopticity and physical

03:47.489 --> 03:51.426
oceanography. It's necessary to have several 
vessels and bring satellites and the whole bit

03:51.446 --> 03:56.166
into it. But it is not for others. It is having 
people that you know are working on this facet. And

04:05.960 --> 04:11.446
this team had an overview so they could put 
together this one working on this facet. And they

04:11.526 --> 04:15.150
came up with a coherent program, which I think was 
good. Now, it's still being done, I suppose. But

04:17.732 --> 04:20.335
NSF didn't ever develop that capacity. Theirs was 
wholly a peer group analysis and evaluation.

04:27.213 --> 04:34.322
Whereas there was practically no peer group in ONR 
unless they wanted to have that kind of

04:27.213 --> 04:34.322
evaluation. They could fall back on it. But they 
had the ability to go out and say, you are doing good

04:36.104 --> 04:41.350
work. We like what you're doing. We want to give you 
support, like that. Give us a proposal. NSF can't

04:48.579 --> 04:53.625
do that,

04:48.579 --> 04:53.625
at least It hasn't. They can't do that or they don't 
do that? Well, they may do it. They may do it, but

05:00.762 --> 05:07.130
pretty much they don't dare go around their 
panels, their evaluation panels. If they do,

05:07.150 --> 05:10.975
they're going to get in trouble. Don't you think 
that's true of all federally? NAW, National

05:14.239 --> 05:22.650
Endowment for the Humanities, or any of these, 
we're pretty well rigidly controlled by our

05:14.239 --> 05:22.650
referees on the panels themselves. Yes, there's 
been a lot of buddy system in it, too. And this has

05:28.233 --> 05:42.275
been one of the problems, is that it was very 
difficult for people at one point to break into the

05:28.233 --> 05:42.275
circle. Fortunately, you see, in 1960, Texas A&M 
was getting practically nothing out of NSA. But in

05:50.710 --> 05:55.698
1976, they're getting a lot out of Minnesota. And 
part of the reason for that is that people

05:55.718 --> 06:04.652
transferred from one institution here to another 
and brought this kind of aura with them. And it's

06:04.672 --> 06:07.797
made a difference. I'd like to ask another 
question on that line. We have noticed that in

06:10.361 --> 06:16.431
people who've joined the A&M faculty, that is 
yourself, Captain Treadwell, Professor Geyer

06:17.879 --> 06:27.912
seemed to have come with contacts in ONR, in NSL, in 
private enterprise, so that they could bring with

06:17.879 --> 06:27.912
them grants. Do you think that's a deliberate 
hiring policy?

06:33.118 --> 06:38.385
It was at first, clearly was, and still is in most 
institutions.

06:41.870 --> 06:46.215
I got associated with ONR And as a consequence, I 
never ask NSF for anything other than a few hundred

06:47.039 --> 06:58.553
dollars once to support a student on a very special 
sort of thing.

07:00.475 --> 07:07.924
When this book is finished, I'm going to write them 
my first proposal for research in the deep sea. And

07:07.944 --> 07:11.067
I'm still going to finish it. I've been invited by 
several people there to come back and discuss

07:14.528 --> 07:21.315
ideas with them, which I suppose would lead to 
proposals. But I just didn't need the support. ONR

07:23.317 --> 07:26.460
was giving me all I could use effectively. And now 
we're getting off on these Mickey Mouse things

07:26.480 --> 07:38.133
with the Bureau of Land Management, which I'm not 
too keen

07:26.480 --> 07:38.133
on. It's pretty short, fused.

07:43.908 --> 07:45.730
telescopic vision kind of work. Are you speaking 
of the work in lignite? No, this is Bureau of Land

07:48.314 --> 07:53.942
Management work on the Outer Continental Shelf, a 
preparatory to drilling for oil. I just happen to

07:54.042 --> 07:58.488
have a few questions I wanted to ask you about that 
while we're here. What do you consider, work on the

07:59.910 --> 08:12.126
Continental Shelf, what do you consider the role 
that private enterprise ought to have to play in

07:59.910 --> 08:12.126
the financing of oceanography's activity 
vis-a-vis the bureau of land management well in a

08:12.376 --> 08:34.232
way they're doing it but it's indirect right now 
they're supporting most of it the way they're

08:12.376 --> 08:34.232
supporting it is by buying these lease rights on 
the outer continental shelf from the bureau of

08:12.376 --> 08:34.232
land management to the tune of one on Destin Dome 
was $212 million, and they got no oil out of it.

08:44.127 --> 08:52.380
So in actual fact, the oil companies are now 
supporting an immense amount of research through

08:44.127 --> 08:52.380
this indirect means. I therefore feel that mines 
better than mine should decide whether they

08:53.762 --> 09:04.017
should do more direct support.

09:05.617 --> 09:08.801
Theirs is very definitely mission-oriented 
work. For example, the state of California is now

09:09.802 --> 09:18.854
imposing additional restrictions on them. Prior 
to drilling, they must do certain kinds of

09:18.974 --> 09:25.162
environmental studies, even though baseline 
studies have been done previously. Do you

09:25.683 --> 09:26.664
consider this good? No, I don't. I think that if we 
carry this too far, it will destroy the

09:28.727 --> 09:35.235
environmental programs. And the pendulum swings 
no matter what you try to do, and it's gone much too

09:36.413 --> 09:47.029
far, in my opinion, of stringency on 
environmental concerns. Do you agree with

09:47.070 --> 09:54.701
Spilhaus that the sea belongs to all countries 
equally, that is, opposed to the concept of a

09:47.070 --> 09:54.701
200-mile line? I assume that to me.

09:59.529 --> 10:03.535
That question is one that I can't answer off the 
cuff, and I have not really thought about it. Okay,

10:07.882 --> 10:17.755
well... Philosophically, one would have to 
answer in the affirmative, but I think there are

10:07.882 --> 10:17.755
many other factors that have to be considered on 
that. Would you like to comment on that in, let's

10:19.197 --> 10:26.266
say, in light of the continental shells and your 
work there? Well, I'll tell you. I'm not sure that

10:30.481 --> 10:36.107
the continental shelf is the only place we're ever 
going to get anything of value out of the ocean. But

10:37.448 --> 10:41.072
obviously, it's the easier part to work on right at 
the moment. So it is the place that's getting all

10:41.092 --> 10:43.734
the attention. I don't know whether you know, but 
Professor Darnell and I have cooked up a symposium

10:44.175 --> 10:51.022
on the ecology and management of the continental 
shelf. Have you learned about that? Well, at any

10:52.543 --> 10:55.906
rate, we've got that cooking. And in it, I have just 
invited, as a member of a panel, the legal counsel

11:01.042 --> 11:09.411
for all of the oil industry working on the 
Continental Shelf from Alaska to Maine. I just

11:10.352 --> 11:26.310
carried on a long conversation with him in New 
Orleans over the phone on where the environmental

11:10.352 --> 11:26.310
movement is going vis-a-vis the oil industry. And 
he should provide some interesting material on

11:29.948 --> 11:34.854
that come this symposium in May, June. I also have, 
well, Darnell and I, but these happen to be people

11:36.115 --> 11:54.336
I've invited, the senior scientist of USGS who has 
strong ideas about the environmental movement in

11:36.115 --> 11:54.336
oil, and we're going to have a gay time over there 
with these guys roaring around at each other. So

11:56.679 --> 11:59.382
I've given a good deal of thought The thing that I am 
sorry about is that we are not able to capitalize on

12:00.256 --> 12:25.462
the funds available through, for example, the 
Bureau of Land Management

12:00.256 --> 12:25.462
for gaining the kind of information that I spoke 
about earlier required for effective management

12:00.256 --> 12:25.462
of the shelf. We are still going out with short fuse 
work And by that I mean you're given the grant today

12:29.568 --> 12:34.113
and you've got to start working tomorrow. And it is 
a contract work. It is not grant work, which means

12:37.217 --> 12:45.426
that if they tell you to collect 20 samples, you've 
got to collect 20 samples or you're in trouble with

12:37.217 --> 12:45.426
the contract. This is not the way to take advantage 
of this excellent opportunity to do very good work

12:47.429 --> 12:56.499
on the commercial. There is a study coming down the 
pike that someone is going to get, I don't know who,

12:59.572 --> 13:28.144
studying the Chenier Plain between Vermilion Bay 
and Galveston Bay from the plus five contour to the

12:59.572 --> 13:28.144
minus 100 foot contour, or isobat, in an attempt to 
understand the total interplay between the ocean

12:59.572 --> 13:28.144
and the marsh and the inner ecological affecting 
areas. And this is a 26-month study in the initial

13:30.755 --> 13:36.482
part. And it is amply funded and will provide for 
the interaction of physical scientists,

13:37.663 --> 13:55.203
biological scientists, social scientists, 
including economists, sociologists. This is the

13:55.223 --> 13:57.085
kind of thing. that I think will lead to effective 
utilization and management of this

13:57.402 --> 14:08.714
multi-purpose area we've got. And what a nice area 
to do it in, this relatively untouched area. Very

14:15.061 --> 14:21.968
few people have been to the coast between Bolivar 
and the Birmingham Bay. What institutions are

14:22.028 --> 14:25.772
competing for that?

14:29.161 --> 14:36.307
I think there's only one academic institution and 
two engineering consortia. I think LSU, there

14:37.488 --> 14:47.917
were 22, and it's been eliminated down now to three 
left, and two engineering firms. And I'm a

14:47.937 --> 14:50.899
consultant to one of them, or to be, if they get it. 
That's not Tereco, is it? No. No, it's not. But I am a

14:54.102 --> 14:58.746
consultant to a Canadian firm and a... an eastern 
firm. And they both have asked me if I would help

15:03.316 --> 15:08.002
them if they get it. Would you describe and tell me 
what TerraEco is? TerraEco? Well, that's a

15:13.069 --> 15:22.683
low-profile avenue for me to consult when I feel 
like doing it now and then. But primarily, I'm

15:23.263 --> 15:29.492
hoping to build this to a retirement point where I 
can do the kind of research I think ought to be done

15:30.518 --> 15:35.744
and fund it myself.

15:38.587 --> 15:41.250
I've been asked to consult and I've turned down 
most of it. And right now I'm just turning in a

15:41.931 --> 15:46.476
permission to consult for a group. I suppose I've 
been asked for maybe $500,000 worth of consulting

15:47.678 --> 15:58.450
that I could have done in the last three or four 
years. Mostly I turned all of this over to two of my

15:59.003 --> 16:13.005
former students who are now working in Taraco,

15:59.003 --> 16:13.005
plus some other people that associate now and 
then. It was an attempt primarily, originally, to

16:14.928 --> 16:27.407
develop a tract of land so that people could live on 
it somewhat more effectively than A track

16:27.691 --> 16:30.154
developer generally develops land. Well, that 
got to be kind of a burden. And so when I got calls to

16:34.599 --> 16:46.012
appear in public, and it didn't look like it was 
very appropriate to represent the university, I

16:34.599 --> 16:46.012
thought, why don't I do that through Taraco? So I 
did some in 73, 74, and some in 75. And we got some

16:52.420 --> 16:56.905
grants now and then that people don't want the 
university involved in. Now, I might run that

16:57.610 --> 17:05.677
through Taraco if, by any chance, these other 
people got this Chenier plane thing. They didn't

17:06.358 --> 17:08.619
invite the universities for the most part. They 
invited LSU, I think, as about the only

17:08.680 --> 17:11.262
university. This was US Fish and Wildlife Service 
that came up with it. But I've had very pleasant

17:16.666 --> 17:19.229
experiences with that. But we can't

17:19.289 --> 17:24.653
advertise. We're not trying to make much out of it. 
Those things where they come to us directly and

17:27.327 --> 17:30.030
ask. As this group in St. Croix called me and said, 
would you appear for us in court? We're being sued

17:36.519 --> 17:42.526
as a class suit against this oil spill problem that 
occurred in 1971. And,

17:42.647 --> 17:51.958
well, I cannot represent the university. So the 
affiliation I will give to get around that is I'm

17:51.978 --> 17:57.165
affiliated with TerraCo. even though I got 
permission from the university to do it. Makes it a

18:01.195 --> 18:02.276
little easier that way. It

18:02.436 --> 18:13.290
is a consulting firm of low key, low stature. 
Anything that I invent, for the most part, I would

18:13.310 --> 18:17.576
probably run through there. I've invented a 
couple of things. I've got a device which I call the

18:21.260 --> 18:26.427
Biotal Ocean Monitor. before pollution studies 
in the ocean are chronic type. And I'm running that

18:31.925 --> 18:34.889
through Terrico. I don't think it belongs in the 
University of Franklin. And I don't have any

18:40.496 --> 18:47.604
retirement at the University particularly, so 
I'm just sort of building up toward my retirement.

18:47.624 --> 18:54.973
Do you think in these kinds of studies that there's 
a conflict between private enterprise and

18:47.624 --> 18:54.973
universities? I don't mean Terrico. I mean work 
that will involve private enterprise and the

18:57.102 --> 19:04.553
university and the study, for example, of the 
marshlands on the Texas coast that you're talking

18:57.102 --> 19:04.553
about. Yes, I do feel that the university is doing 
too many things now that they should not be doing.

19:13.767 --> 19:25.725
And Jack Williams and John Calhoun 
notwithstanding, I think that, let me cite this as

19:13.767 --> 19:25.725
an example.

19:26.836 --> 19:37.171
Routine things that are done by the university 
ought better to be done by industry, by private

19:26.836 --> 19:37.171
enterprise. They are jamming the research 
capacity of the chemistry department. Not to

19:41.757 --> 19:48.788
speak about somebody else's department, but they 
are jamming with requests or actual work being

19:41.757 --> 19:48.788
done. Simple routine analyses for hydrocarbons 
in the environment. Now what value is this to a

19:52.891 --> 19:58.237
research-oriented institution? Unless you can 
make some use of it. The university should never

20:00.580 --> 20:22.324
get, if it's a state university in my opinion, in 
crossfire between the federal government and the

20:00.580 --> 20:22.324
state, where it has from time to time taken a 
research, so-called research activity, and they

20:00.580 --> 20:22.324
have got into a framework where the state has a 
vested interest and so has the federal

20:00.580 --> 20:22.324
government. It is a state institution receiving 
federal support as well. And they come out. And if

20:28.161 --> 20:30.484
they rule, they go one way or the other. And they're 
going to make an enemy on one side or the other. And I

20:34.310 --> 20:39.376
think the university should be out of that. I think 
that the university in the main, things done by

20:40.277 --> 20:49.830
consulting firms today should not be approached 
by the university. They are destroying their

20:51.532 --> 21:02.045
opportunities to do the esoteric kind of thing 
that we don't know where it leads now. Are you

21:02.546 --> 21:07.292
referring then specifically to the extension 
services that are open? No, not alone to that. No,

21:09.195 --> 21:10.016
not alone. That may be, in agriculture, may be a 
necessary service to be performed. Maybe there

21:14.041 --> 21:17.105
aren't private groups that do that so much. But 
certainly, I'm talking about Some of the work we do

21:19.257 --> 21:32.154
in oceanography, for example, just plain routine 
stuff, going back time after time, taking grain

21:19.257 --> 21:32.154
size analysis samples or certain biological 
samples, where we aren't going to learn anything

21:19.257 --> 21:32.154
since we've done it repeatedly. Who is this being 
done for then, this routine type work? Well,

21:34.778 --> 21:38.803
Bureau of Land Management is one of them. USGS.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.672
Police departments. Whole lot of people. We've 
got an analytical services laboratory. This is

21:51.671 --> 21:52.373
fine. But it ought to really be backing up research 
activities in the university much more than some

21:52.694 --> 22:00.274
of these others. Now, that's one man's view, 
obviously. But it's one I've thought about a good

22:02.680 --> 22:04.705
deal. Well, I wanted to ask you to evaluate the role 
of academic programs today in sciences. And you

22:11.268 --> 22:12.809
partially already answered this. Do you think 
they're becoming too specifically oriented

22:12.829 --> 22:21.318
towards practical research or applied sciences 
rather than theoretical research or theoretical

22:12.829 --> 22:21.318
sciences? Well, there has to be a happy balance in 
instruction as opposed to the research aspects of

22:21.338 --> 22:32.008
instruction. There has to be a happy balance 
between the theoretical and the applied and

22:34.553 --> 22:39.080
practical. Because we do have to think of our 
students and what they face. They've got to have

22:43.868 --> 22:52.782
enough experience in practical matters to aid 
them if that is the kind of job open to them. Today,

22:53.234 --> 22:57.237
not all of them can go into the academic world. 
There's no doubt of that. And so we have to have

22:58.478 --> 23:00.260
that. This is a distinct question from the other 
one of the role of the practical in terms of the use

23:00.640 --> 23:11.650
of your facility.

23:13.751 --> 23:22.819
Should a $300,000 piece of equipment, analytical 
equipment be used to solve the needs of routine

23:23.508 --> 23:47.730
water analysis for petroleum hydrocarbons, or 
should it be used for the research activities

23:23.508 --> 23:47.730
which are exploring much more than just whether 
the compound is there and in what quantity, but

23:23.508 --> 23:47.730
what it is actually doing by being there. These are 
two entirely different approaches to the same

23:47.750 --> 23:51.574
compound. And I think the university ought to be 
working on the latter.

23:57.827 --> 24:02.212
In your career, what has been your more favorite, I 
should think? That's very poorly put. Or what type

24:03.333 --> 24:10.502
of research would you say you enjoyed the more, 
deep ocean research or deep sea research? I've had

24:12.564 --> 24:21.375
two things that have been extremely attractive to 
me, both of which through probably poor personal

24:23.465 --> 24:37.679
discipline, have led into very difficult 
problems

24:23.465 --> 24:37.679
for which I may not be fully prepared. But both are 
still admirably intriguing and soul satisfying.

24:46.308 --> 24:48.190
The deep sea is very difficult to study. But it is, 
it's been one of the thrilling experiences of my

24:48.811 --> 25:01.531
life to work that way and to have been with students 
during these cruises when, you know, we all shared

24:48.811 --> 25:01.531
the same excitement.

25:04.456 --> 25:14.532
But also this work in shallower water on these rock 
reefs, I still feel I've been letting it mellow now

25:04.456 --> 25:14.532
for some time, but it's all I still feel that these 
extremely complex populations on these

25:15.271 --> 25:34.781
submarine rock reefs are going to yield insights 
into ecology that we have not yet codified. And I'm

25:34.801 --> 25:44.215
just hoping that I can maintain my mental 
faculties long enough to have sufficient time to

25:34.801 --> 25:44.215
really go somewhere where you can get away from 
this and really think about it. You know, it's sort

25:48.691 --> 26:08.042
of like,

25:48.691 --> 26:08.042
well, daily distractions are nowhere to

25:48.691 --> 26:08.042
enter the plan for thoughtful work. You know, you 
come to a point where you can no longer just grind it

26:08.512 --> 26:12.076
out on a computer. You've got to think about it. And 
that's where I am with some of this. I can just about

26:16.701 --> 26:20.145
see that it's there, but I can't get it. And I don't 
know what it's going to take associating with

26:21.046 --> 26:23.809
other people. Maybe this symposium, you know. 
There'll be enough stimulation of people coming

26:27.092 --> 26:32.138
all together in a couple of gold sessions. You 
might just hit on what you want. I know there's

26:34.020 --> 26:35.802
something I want there. But David C. had the same 
problem when he wanted to write the sea. He said, I

26:40.551 --> 26:42.253
had to get away from the sea. I went way inland to do 
it, because you can't. The sea is an overwhelming

26:44.856 --> 26:49.921
experience. It comes back to that emotionality 
and identification I talked about. How would you

26:54.967 --> 27:01.935
explain your interest in the crustacea that you 
specialize in and the systematics there? How does

27:01.955 --> 27:04.318
that fit in? This was something that I wanted to do. 
that I'd never done, is describe a new species. I

27:09.324 --> 27:11.667
wanted the experience of doing this. And I'd 
always been intrigued by this since studying in

27:11.687 --> 27:22.059
that history of science course Carl Linnaeus, or 
Carolus Linnaeus, you know, who was the starter of

27:11.687 --> 27:22.059
modern systematics. I'd always wanted the 
experience. This was a group no one was working on.

27:26.264 --> 27:28.266
I couldn't get anybody to identify them. Was it 
from a practical need that you needed... Yeah, and

27:28.921 --> 27:35.869
so I said, this group, and they intrigued me, these 
little rascals, too. They seem to have beautiful

27:35.889 --> 27:38.693
isopathic limits. That is, they are restricted 
depth-wise. And so, and since we were getting a

27:43.218 --> 27:56.233
lot, we were getting things that a lot of deep-sea 
biologists with this equipment and this monster

27:43.218 --> 27:56.233
trawl, I was getting stuff people just hadn't seen 
before. Now, Robert Menzies is... is an eminent

27:57.862 --> 28:12.001
deep-sea biologist, but when he came over here and 
looked at some of our collection, he'd never seen

27:57.862 --> 28:12.001
some of these things because the Menzies trawl he 
was working with just didn't get him. Well, that's

28:12.021 --> 28:15.326
nothing against Menzies, but it just turns out 
that he didn't know. Now, one of my former

28:15.646 --> 28:23.397
students, Gil Rowe at Woods Hole, he goes down in 
the deep submersible and takes a look at him with

28:23.832 --> 28:25.981
his eyes. But I've still got organisms I've 
collected, and big ones. I have never been able to

28:30.498 --> 28:32.225
photograph them. Every other major group of 
animals
