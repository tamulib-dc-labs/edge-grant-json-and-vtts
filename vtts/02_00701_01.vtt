00:01.077 --> 00:04.161
Cross Jr., head of the Department of Aerospace 
Engineering. Today's date is July 24th. Dr.

00:07.767 --> 00:10.731
Cross, would you discuss your boyhood years?

00:13.835 --> 00:18.983
Born and raised in a small town in central 
Pennsylvania called Mill Hall. Went to high

00:19.884 --> 00:23.970
school three miles away in Lock Haven, 
Pennsylvania. Graduated from high school in 1948

00:25.693 --> 00:30.780
and went to Penn State. Where is Penn State? State 
College. What's the name of the city? State

00:37.215 --> 00:39.117
College is the name of the city. Stayed there two 
years and entered the Air Force. Alright, before

00:45.085 --> 00:48.389
you go on that, would you tell us about your 
parents? Parents were both born and raised on

00:49.551 --> 00:53.936
farms. My mother was a housewife. She had gone to 
the local teacher's college and graduated from

01:00.173 --> 01:04.880
that and was a certified teacher. My dad worked for 
Slovenia Electric Company most of the time, quit

01:06.442 --> 01:21.845
after I left high school and entered into his own 
business. What about brothers and sisters? One

01:25.991 --> 01:27.694
sister, younger. Where does she live today? She 
lives in Reading, Pennsylvania.

01:36.846 --> 01:39.530
When you went to Penn State, you studied aerospace 
engineering? No, physics. Physics. You got your

01:41.313 --> 01:42.775
bachelor's degree in physics. No, just two years 
in physics. Would you discuss that?

01:49.886 --> 01:50.587
In what sense? I stayed at Penn State only two 
years. and studied physics. The Korean War was in

01:58.454 --> 02:05.181
the middle of its biggest flap. I left and joined 
the Air Force as an aviation cadet. Where were you

02:11.126 --> 02:13.408
stationed during this time? I went to flight 
school in Columbus, Mississippi and Enid,

02:14.449 --> 02:19.114
Oklahoma. How long were you in the Air Force? 
Twenty-two years. You stayed in straight

02:24.903 --> 02:27.366
through? Stayed in straight through. Alright,

02:29.909 --> 02:34.874
what about your bachelor's degree? I returned to 
Penn State as an Air Force student in 57 after

02:35.875 --> 02:52.834
having flown for four and a half years and finished 
a bachelor's degree in aerospace, really

02:35.875 --> 02:52.834
aeronautical engineering in 59.

02:56.881 --> 03:00.886
What about your graduate work? Well, following 
the bachelor's degree, I was assigned to the

03:00.906 --> 03:05.190
10-foot Trans-Sonic Wind Tunnel at Wright Field. 
Where? Wright Field, Wright-Patterson Air Force

03:06.872 --> 03:14.321
Base in Dayton, Ohio.

03:14.341 --> 03:24.913
I was there for about four years, and Ohio State had 
a local

03:27.425 --> 03:34.312
part of the university graduate school, which I 
attended after duty hours. The Air Force sent me

03:35.813 --> 03:47.965
off again in 62 to the University of Texas for 
graduate school, and I finally finished both an

03:35.813 --> 03:47.965
M.S. and a Ph.D. at the University of Texas. What 
year did you finish the Ph.D.? 68. What was the

03:53.550 --> 03:55.592
subject of your dissertation? It involved the 
lee-side flow field of a sharp-edged delta wing,

03:56.821 --> 04:11.007
really a series of delta wings, at hypersonic Mach 
numbers. It was an experimental

04:11.027 --> 04:16.677
study, primarily. Did a series of wind tunnel 
tests a small tunnel we had at the Aerospace

04:22.808 --> 04:40.998
Research Laboratories in Dayton and also a series 
of studies in the I guess it was a four-foot

04:22.808 --> 04:40.998
hypersonic tunnel in the Arnold Air Development 
Center in Tallahoma, Tennessee.

04:43.822 --> 04:45.205
Can you tell us about your family?

04:48.249 --> 04:49.812
Married Judy Wanker, galley dated in high school 
after flight school. Spell that last name.

04:59.455 --> 05:05.082
W-E-N-K-E-R.

04:59.455 --> 05:05.082
Do you have children? Six. Six children. Three 
boys, three girls, ranging in age now from 27

05:06.424 --> 05:14.113
through 17. All right. You left the Air Force in 
1972. Three. What did you do then? I became the

05:23.289 --> 05:30.957
director, well I went to Mississippi State 
University as a professor of aerospace

05:23.289 --> 05:30.957
engineering and director of the Raspid Flight 
Research Laboratory. Did you spell the name of

05:31.818 --> 05:33.520
that? R-A-S-P-E-T. How long did you stay there? 
Six years. Did you stay there until 79 when you came

05:39.447 --> 05:44.093
to A&M as head of the Department of Aerospace 
Engineering? Yeah, I came here in July of 79.

05:49.225 --> 05:53.048
What was the name of the department head before you 
came here? There was an interim department head,

05:53.068 --> 06:04.319
Stan Lowy, and prior to him Al Kronk who had been the 
department head since I think the late 60s. Did you

06:04.339 --> 06:06.360
spell those last names there? Yes, Stan Lowy is 
L-O-W-Y and Al Kronk is C-R-O-N-K.

06:07.021 --> 06:19.232
What are some of the duties that you undertake as 
department head?

06:20.663 --> 06:28.834
I'm responsible for the administration of the 
academic program and the research program. The

06:30.616 --> 06:45.996
academic program includes the budgets and 
planning and

06:30.616 --> 06:45.996
growth development of the faculty,

06:30.616 --> 06:45.996
also the development of the graduate program. 
responsible for the daily or the day-by-day

06:47.005 --> 06:59.207
administrative duties,

06:47.005 --> 06:59.207
which there are uncounted ones of. Or do you teach 
any classes? I teach regularly typically one

07:03.455 --> 07:08.043
class. In what? Aerodynamics.

07:16.351 --> 07:24.264
Could you discuss the number of faculty members 
that you supervise and where some of the schools

07:16.351 --> 07:24.264
that these faculty members are from? Okay, right 
now we have,

07:24.284 --> 07:29.893
let's see, 17.

07:33.899 --> 07:36.383
Ohio State, I guess, is the dominant school. We 
have three from Ohio State, one from Rutgers, I'm

07:41.512 --> 07:43.314
from the University of Texas. Well, there are two 
others from the University of Texas. So we have

07:46.338 --> 07:48.220
three from UT.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.105
Two from Mississippi State. One from Illinois.

08:01.197 --> 08:01.797
Let's see. One from MIT.

08:07.972 --> 08:08.412
All right. What is the size of the aerospace 
engineering program here compared to the other

08:08.893 --> 08:13.537
engineering programs?

08:16.840 --> 08:23.946
Relative to the other engineering programs at 
A&M, we're right in the middle of the ten. About how

08:26.288 --> 08:28.070
many students do you have enrolled? We have about 
550 undergraduates expect in the fall. That's

08:37.942 --> 08:39.043
fall of 81. We'll have over 600, which makes us 
probably the largest aero department in the

08:39.083 --> 08:45.031
country. The largest what? The largest aero 
department in the country. Oh,

08:48.155 --> 08:52.981
okay. About how many graduate students did you say 
you said? No, we're deficient in the graduate

08:56.285 --> 08:58.548
student area. We're having a dreadful time of 
tracking them. We've got right now about 20. And

09:05.217 --> 09:07.780
you have both of the graduate degrees offered 
here? We offer MS, ME, DE, and PhD. Why is it

09:17.315 --> 09:22.600
difficult to attract graduate students into 
aerospace engineering? They're getting very

09:22.620 --> 09:34.570
lucrative offers from industry with promise of 
company subsidized graduate studies on site. And

09:34.590 --> 09:37.513
that appears much more attractive than anything 
we can offer.

09:41.088 --> 09:43.711
That's a major limitation in our research program 
too.

09:46.515 --> 09:51.481
During the 1970s, as I understand it, there was a 
major slump in aerospace engineering all over the

09:46.515 --> 09:51.481
country. Could you discuss that? There was. 
Actually, it started in the 60s and continued into

09:55.687 --> 10:00.733
the middle 70s.

10:04.156 --> 10:17.619
The major source of the thing came about as a wind 
down of the Vietnamese war, I believe, since the

10:04.156 --> 10:17.619
aerospace industry is very closely coupled with 
DOD budget. But we've been slowly recovering to

10:17.639 --> 10:29.218
the point now where I think we've exceeded, at 
least in terms of undergraduate enrollment, the

10:17.639 --> 10:29.218
level we had reached during the late 60s.

10:30.852 --> 10:35.738
Historically, the aerospace industry has been 
cyclical.

10:38.862 --> 10:46.051
There's been some effort by government to 
eliminate the peaks and the valleys. I'm not real

10:47.292 --> 10:48.974
sure if that's going to happen. But aerospace 
engineers are being used in more and more types of

10:50.837 --> 10:59.087
industry now, not so tightly tied to the aerospace 
industries. So engineers with aerospace

10:59.354 --> 11:04.779
engineering degrees can get jobs in related 
fields? They can get jobs in a whole range of fields

11:04.799 --> 11:26.340
which are just starting to recognize some of the 
things that aerospace engineers are

11:04.799 --> 11:26.340
particularly good at and that's lightweight 
structures,

11:04.799 --> 11:26.340
control systems,

11:04.799 --> 11:26.340
things that involve fluid flows, and more 
recently the transportation industry has been

11:28.379 --> 11:34.448
hiring aerospace engineers.

11:40.657 --> 11:45.905
Okay, could you explain in layman's terms what an 
aerospace engineer does on the job? Oh boy,

11:45.925 --> 11:48.569
there's a whole range of things he does. Typically 
the young engineer that is one right fresh out of

11:49.190 --> 11:54.538
the university with a bachelor's degree We'll 
wind up working for a senior engineer, and he'll

11:56.105 --> 12:05.794
serve primarily as the interface between the 
senior engineer and the computer terminal. And

12:08.117 --> 12:14.103
slowly he'll be worked into involvement in more 
significant kinds of problems.

12:18.467 --> 12:23.732
We maintain that our engineers are trained 
principally as designers. and expect that

12:25.670 --> 12:30.377
they'll be involved in the design process.

12:34.422 --> 12:49.804
They're also well suited for not

12:34.422 --> 12:49.804
necessarily research, but the kinds of things 
that are categorized as experimental

12:34.422 --> 12:49.804
development

12:34.422 --> 12:49.804
or exploratory development. and projects which 
involve development of the technology relative

12:51.792 --> 13:12.213
to the technology which is pertinent to the 
product, either an aerospace system or whatever

12:51.792 --> 13:12.213
the company happens to be producing, automobiles 
maybe.

13:15.377 --> 13:19.521
OK. Of about 550 students that you have, about how 
many of them are women?

13:23.197 --> 13:25.701
Last semester we had twelve percent. Twelve 
percent. So sixty. Alright, about what percent

13:29.867 --> 13:34.454
are black?

13:34.474 --> 13:35.456
Less than one percent. Why is it difficult to 
attract blacks to engineering programs? I don't

13:40.403 --> 13:41.184
really know. If I did know, I would have more.

13:49.156 --> 13:50.959
What about foreign students? We have very few 
foreign students

13:52.694 --> 14:00.651
in either the graduate program or the 
undergraduate program. We have currently two

14:00.711 --> 14:13.217
foreign students out of about 20 in the graduate 
program, and I'm not real sure how many in the

14:00.711 --> 14:13.217
undergraduate program. Well, some of the other 
engineering programs attract a good many foreign

14:13.568 --> 14:22.603
students, so why would it be that this aerospace 
didn't attract as many as some of the others? Well,

14:23.024 --> 14:24.987
the program does attract a lot. We don't admit 
many. Okay. What about your admissions standard?

14:30.316 --> 14:32.880
Can you talk about that in the graduate program? 
The graduate program admissions are pretty much a

14:34.103 --> 14:39.171
function of departmental

14:41.429 --> 14:52.485
policy, our control mechanism really is tied to 
fellowships,

14:41.429 --> 14:52.485
research assistantships, teaching 
assistantships, things of that sort. We have a lot

14:53.407 --> 15:03.642
of applicants that are in fact qualified for entry 
that never come because we don't offer an

14:53.407 --> 15:03.642
assistantship to them.

15:04.443 --> 15:08.449
What do you go by to decide who gets offered an 
assistantship? It's pretty much on the basis of

15:09.087 --> 15:17.837
quality, and the quality criteria is associated 
with undergraduate GPR. We look for

15:18.138 --> 15:26.608
undergraduate GPRs well in excess of three, and 
also GRE scores. We like to see the GRE scores in

15:26.628 --> 15:30.252
excess of 1,100.

15:35.598 --> 15:41.003
What salary does a beginning aerospace engineer 
with a bachelor's degree usually expect to

15:35.598 --> 15:41.003
receive? This past spring they were receiving 
typically $23,000.

15:48.931 --> 15:54.136
What about someone with more experience and a 
graduate degree, what would they expect? A

15:54.156 --> 16:03.985
master's degree was typically being offered 
$26,000, $27,000.

16:04.775 --> 16:09.319
and a PhD, $33,000 nominally. Is there still a 
problem with aerospace engineers having

16:10.040 --> 16:17.086
difficulty finding positions the way it was 
earlier? No. All of our graduates at all levels

16:18.127 --> 16:26.134
have had multiple offers, and it's been a matter of 
selecting the one that was most appealing to them.

16:27.095 --> 16:33.381
I know at one time, particularly in the Seattle 
area, there was a problem with aerospace

16:27.095 --> 16:33.381
engineers who couldn't find jobs. do you know 
anything about that up there how that situation's

16:33.867 --> 16:57.327
been alleviated yeah the situation has been 
alleviated I don't know if it's been cured the

16:33.867 --> 16:57.327
Seattle aerospace industry is a one company 
operation that's Boeing and when Boeing has

16:33.867 --> 16:57.327
problems and the Seattle-based aerospace 
engineers have problems right now Boeing is very

16:33.867 --> 16:57.327
very healthy

17:02.217 --> 17:05.241
How do you find the quality of your undergraduate 
students? The quality of the entering freshmen is

17:06.883 --> 17:11.368
typically not very good. And we've found that of an 
entering freshman class, we'll probably only

17:13.491 --> 17:21.721
graduate somewhere between 25% and 35%. So it's 
very inefficient. And most of these, you think,

17:25.846 --> 17:31.853
drop out or they go to other fields of engineering 
or what? I think most of them leave engineering.

17:36.852 --> 17:41.019
Typically they're poorly counseled and poorly 
prepared by their high schools. So most leave

17:42.361 --> 17:44.625
engineering. Some transfer to other engineering 
disciplines. Could it be that they enter the

17:48.612 --> 17:53.821
program without understanding what aerospace 
engineering actually is? They enter the program

17:54.061 --> 17:57.908
with a fuzzy understanding of what engineering 
is. and some mistaken notion about what aerospace

17:59.407 --> 18:05.136
is really all about. You find the quality of the 
graduate students greater compared to the

18:05.176 --> 18:11.266
undergraduates? The quality of the graduate 
students

18:11.827 --> 18:21.702
is not as high as I would like to see it, but it's 
considerably better than the undergraduate.

18:28.313 --> 18:32.959
We have better control over the graduate program 
than we do the undergraduate.

18:37.485 --> 18:42.672
What about

18:37.485 --> 18:42.672
your research duties here? Can you discuss the 
research program? Okay,

18:46.457 --> 18:55.789
I'm head of the Aerospace Engineering Division of 
TEAS. And I have essentially the same kinds of

18:57.980 --> 19:06.996
responsibilities

18:57.980 --> 19:06.996
in the research side as I do in the academic side. 
That is, I'm responsible for preparing budgets

19:07.056 --> 19:19.819
and plans and the daily routine of administrative 
responsibilities, responsible for recruiting

19:20.930 --> 19:25.777
competent research people, competent research 
support people. I'm directly responsible for the

19:26.878 --> 19:38.153
7 foot by 10 foot low speed wind tunnel, and also the 
flight mechanics laboratory at the research

19:26.878 --> 19:38.153
center.

19:43.300 --> 19:50.650
And more recently, I guess, a 6 by 6 foot 
environmental wind I'm responsible for the

19:52.925 --> 20:06.122
overall maintenance of an adequate level of 
activity in the research of aerodynamic or

19:52.925 --> 20:06.122
aerospace-related topics.

20:09.286 --> 20:10.768
Where do you do the research here? What part of the 
campus is this done on? The wind tunnel is at

20:14.172 --> 20:16.155
Easterwood Airport. The flight mechanics lab is 
at the

20:16.395 --> 20:22.543
research center. at the old Bryan Air Force Base. 
The other major facility we utilize is the

20:26.396 --> 20:34.489
mainframe computer at the data processing 
center. So those that are involved in

20:37.193 --> 20:42.222
experimental research are typically working off 
campus. Those that are involved in theoretical

20:42.342 --> 20:49.594
research are primarily working on the campus. Do 
the faculty members divide their time equally

20:51.278 --> 20:56.164
between teaching and research? It depends. We 
target senior faculty for 50% research during the

20:58.467 --> 21:10.062
academic year and 100% during the summers, which 
amounts to a total research activity of about 67%.

21:10.843 --> 21:19.294
The junior faculty, in a break, occurs someplace 
in a guy's professional development as an

21:20.050 --> 21:21.412
associate professor. The junior faculty, we 
expect to be involved in 25% research during the

21:23.876 --> 21:41.065
academic year and 100% during the summers, which 
amounts to something like 48% overall

21:23.876 --> 21:41.065
split. But involvement in research implies 
outside support. We have only very limited

21:45.987 --> 21:50.892
resources to subsidize research. The money we 
have we spend typically in support of preliminary

21:51.712 --> 22:08.308
research activity by junior faculty leading to 
hopefully development of a proposal and support

21:51.712 --> 22:08.308
from some outside agency. What are some of the 
sources of your funding for the research program?

22:14.033 --> 22:15.335
It comes from all over. I guess the major sources 
are NASA at several research centers, DOD, the

22:15.375 --> 22:43.450
National Science Foundation,

22:15.375 --> 22:43.450
a whole range of companies that contract with us 
for various kinds of research, architectural

22:15.375 --> 22:43.450
companies, aircraft companies, some energy 
companies or oil companies.

22:52.987 --> 22:55.110
What about state legislative funding? Does that 
finance some of the research? Yeah.

23:03.339 --> 23:14.652
It supports the research to the extent that we can 
pay those

23:03.339 --> 23:14.652
kinds of people that support the researchers. As 
an example,

23:17.216 --> 23:23.105
we have an A&P mechanic at the flight level. We pay 
his salary out of state money. 25% of my salary is

23:27.772 --> 23:32.079
paid out of state money. We pay our secretary out of 
state money. And we'll also support young faculty

23:35.864 --> 23:43.356
in the development of their research program. you 
consider the state legislative funding adequate

23:45.108 --> 24:10.727
or is more needed i think it's adequate you can 
always use more what has happened in this

23:45.108 --> 24:10.727
department is that there's been an inadequate 
investment historically say going back 15 years

23:45.108 --> 24:10.727
there's been a woefully inadequate investment in 
capital equipment The capital equipment that was

24:12.327 --> 24:37.237
here 15 years ago has been depleted because of 
inadequate investment in maintenance and

24:12.327 --> 24:37.237
update, so that now our capability,

24:12.327 --> 24:37.237
particularly in the experimental area, is 
seriously limited by inadequate equipment. What

24:38.038 --> 24:41.001
was the reason the equipment was not properly 
invested into? I think primarily due to

24:44.163 --> 24:47.947
inattention. Sir? Inattention. Nobody was 
paying attention to what was going on and what was

24:50.651 --> 24:54.515
required.

24:59.401 --> 25:07.630
That combined with the fact that during that 
period, I guess the majority of the research

24:59.401 --> 25:07.630
involved theoretical things. It isn't peculiar 
to Texas A&M. I think it's been typically the case

25:11.827 --> 25:38.730
where many universities, particularly state 
universities, state-endowed universities,

25:11.827 --> 25:38.730
have depleted their capital resources over the 
last 15 or 20 years to the point now where

25:11.827 --> 25:38.730
laboratory equipment, particularly research 
equipment and facilities, have been virtually

25:11.827 --> 25:38.730
totally depleted And we're faced now with a 
monster problem of replacing those things at

25:39.554 --> 25:50.787
prices that are orders of magnitude higher than 
they had been.

25:54.852 --> 26:02.621
That's going to be a long time and difficult

25:54.852 --> 26:02.621
period to correct these things.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.405
Okay. Tell us something more specifically about 
particular research projects that are now

26:07.718 --> 26:11.862
underway.

26:14.465 --> 26:15.186
Okay. Let's see, starting with the theoretical 
activity. I guess Lee Carlson is the shiny one

26:22.354 --> 26:29.802
exactly right now. He's been involved for many 
years and is still active in the research of

26:29.842 --> 26:37.270
transonic airfoil development.

26:39.713 --> 26:48.008
That's been extended or expanded now to include 
three-dimensional aspects of that problem. He's

26:49.310 --> 26:54.419
been funded by NASA Langley for six, eight years in 
that area. He's also involved in a

26:55.521 --> 27:01.772
massive separation problem for 
three-dimensional wings that are approaching

27:03.187 --> 27:10.944
stalled conditions. He's also been involved in

27:13.249 --> 27:21.246
a balloon, a large scientific balloon analyses 
which involved a float condition for these

27:21.462 --> 27:37.260
things, funded out of Wallops Research Center, 
which is a piece of NASA.

27:37.280 --> 27:42.827
Dave Norton is an experimentalist, so I guess I 
shouldn't jump onto him right away. Walt Hasler,

27:42.867 --> 27:47.993
another very strong theoretical... Spell that 
last name. Hasler, H-A-I-S-L-E-R,

27:49.306 --> 28:13.339
has been involved for many years in applications 
of finite element methods to the constitutive

27:49.306 --> 28:13.339
modeling of materials and analyses of various 
kinds of structures.

28:16.424 --> 28:17.947
Let's see, what else do we have? David Allen has 
recently come on board. He will become active also

28:20.291 --> 28:24.859
in that research area. Dave Norton has been very 
active in the area of environmental

28:27.223 --> 28:35.378
aerodynamics, which is primarily an 
experimental a continuing experimental study of

28:36.067 --> 28:51.898
the wind effects on architectural structures, 
new buildings, offshore oil rigs,

28:36.067 --> 28:51.898
things of that sort.

28:57.532 --> 28:59.455
Stan Miley has been active. Say that last night, 
please. Stan Miley, M-I-L-E-Y, an associate

29:01.178 --> 29:25.075
professor, been here two years, has been active in 
a theoretical study of the influence of a

29:01.178 --> 29:25.075
propeller slipstream on forces generated by 
wings, nacelles, and aircraft fuselages.

29:25.797 --> 29:31.664
primarily interested in the interaction of those 
three aircraft components in the propeller

29:25.797 --> 29:31.664
slipstream.

29:37.210 --> 29:47.923
He's also been active in the study of low Reynolds 
number airfoils in application to windmills and

29:37.210 --> 29:47.923
power generation.

29:50.654 --> 30:07.855
Howard Chevalier has been active in wind tunnel 
studies and flight test studies of stall

29:50.654 --> 30:07.855
prevention systems, or the general problem of 
stall prevention in general aviation aircraft.

30:07.875 --> 30:16.746
He's also been recently involved in wind tunnel 
studies of various aircraft configurations. in

30:17.350 --> 30:23.478
particular forward sweep of wings and canard 
surfaces.

30:29.185 --> 30:30.967
That's all I can think of right now. So you entered 
the University of Teaching in 1973 at Mississippi

30:33.030 --> 30:39.418
State. Yeah. Have you seen any change in just those 
eight years that you've been involved in What

30:45.835 --> 30:54.064
changes have you seen in the aerospace program, 
even though taking into account that there are two

30:45.835 --> 30:54.064
institutions involved here that you've been in? 
Yeah, the really big change has involved the

30:54.364 --> 31:09.261
increased application of computer methods to

30:54.364 --> 31:09.261
all phases of the thing, and in particular the use 
of computers in design. We're just now making a

31:10.422 --> 31:20.643
sizable investment in computers for use in 
systems design, particularly aircraft design.

31:21.404 --> 31:31.705
We have a series of three courses in design of 
structures, propulsion, and aircraft. And we'll

31:33.136 --> 31:40.064
be using the computer more and more in connection 
with the sizable investments required. That's

31:40.104 --> 31:46.452
one of the areas in which there's been an 
inadequate university investment. Not peculiar

31:46.472 --> 31:53.120
to A&M, but most universities have fallen into 
that trap. Have you seen any change in the quality

31:55.663 --> 31:59.768
of the students during those eight years? Yeah, 
there has been, I think,

32:00.322 --> 32:20.623
kind of an anomaly occur in that we're getting more 
and more of the really super good students, but

32:00.322 --> 32:20.623
we're also getting more and more of the not so super 
good students. So the tail ends of the

32:20.643 --> 32:28.050
distribution of student quality is moving out in 
both directions. But we are getting more and more

32:29.549 --> 32:32.632
of the really good students. That's the same 
observation that Dr. Jones in electrical

32:33.172 --> 32:40.620
engineering had found, what you just said.

32:40.640 --> 32:41.000
I interviewed him. He found the same situation. 
The so-called poor students, what are their

32:42.822 --> 32:46.926
deficiencies in? Mathematics and the physical 
sciences and motivation.

32:56.014 --> 32:56.755
You mentioned this. new investment needed in the 
computer. Are there any new facilities being

33:00.484 --> 33:04.610
planned for aerospace engineering here?

33:08.076 --> 33:18.713
Not specifically for aerospace engineering, but 
there is a committee, or maybe several

33:08.076 --> 33:18.713
committees, that's looking very carefully at the 
computer problem in particular. And whatever

33:20.736 --> 33:24.582
they do will have a major impact on aerospace 
engineering. I don't really know precisely where

33:27.059 --> 33:36.988
the whole thing is headed, but whatever they do is 
going to have a major impact in our program. Is

33:39.010 --> 33:45.936
aerospace engineering going to be in this 
building you're in now indefinitely?

33:46.617 --> 33:53.843
Yes, we've been here since I guess 54 or so when the 
building was new. There's a minor renovation

33:56.438 --> 34:05.666
occurring in the building now, and we'll relocate 
to the second floor in the fall, but we'll be in this

33:56.438 --> 34:05.666
building for the next 180 years or so. What other 
departments are in this building? The business

34:08.509 --> 34:24.083
college just moved out in June, leaving 
engineering design graphics on the third floor,

34:08.509 --> 34:24.083
sharing the middle floor with us, and there's a 
small piece of parks and recreation in the other

34:08.509 --> 34:24.083
end of the middle floor.

34:29.024 --> 34:34.052
What do you think are some of the challenges that 
aerospace engineers can look for in the 1980s?

34:37.357 --> 34:37.918
Oh, boy. I guess the major challenge involves the 
impact of the energy situation on transportation

34:39.300 --> 34:54.964
in general, but in particular aircraft.

35:00.918 --> 35:04.642
It also impacts such things as the automotive 
industry. And there have been more and more space

35:04.722 --> 35:10.929
engineers involved in working that problem. That 
seems to me to be the major challenge, the

35:11.690 --> 35:21.942
development of transportation systems which are 
energy efficient.

35:24.805 --> 35:30.672
Prior to 1975 or whenever it was that that the OPEC 
countries first lowered the boom on us, the major

35:31.782 --> 35:41.133
emphasis was on performance rather than energy 
efficiency. Now that has swung completely around

35:42.535 --> 35:58.093
the other way to the point where energy efficiency 
is the primary concern,

35:42.535 --> 35:58.093
with maybe the possible exception of 
defense-related systems.

36:01.381 --> 36:13.512
What is the best that you personally expect

36:01.381 --> 36:13.512
for an energy efficient engine to get, say for an 
automobile? The best performance? That's really

36:18.417 --> 36:30.308
difficult to put a number on because it's a 
combination of the engine with the device,

36:18.417 --> 36:30.308
whatever it is, an automobile or a truck or a bus. 
Now

36:31.385 --> 36:43.479
in regard to say commuter type automobiles 
they're talking in terms of 75 miles per gallon

36:31.385 --> 36:43.479
within the next several years. You think that's 
realistic? Yeah, yeah I believe it is. You might

36:48.845 --> 36:55.553
not like the vehicle but I believe you can get 75 
miles per gallon.

36:59.971 --> 37:06.082
But you mentioned earlier that Texas A&M had one of 
the largest aerospace engineering programs in

36:59.971 --> 37:06.082
the country. Would you elaborate on that? I think 
it is the largest undergraduate aerospace

37:09.107 --> 37:14.556
program in the country. And this program was 
established in 1940. Is that about the time that

37:18.343 --> 37:23.211
most of the others were established across the 
country, or is that a little later or earlier? I

37:23.765 --> 37:34.481
think that's just about the same time most of them 
are popping up, 1938, 39, 40, and on

37:23.765 --> 37:34.481
through the 40s. Then during the 60s, a lot of aero 
departments were combined with other

37:34.541 --> 37:43.775
departments because of low enrollment and things 
of that sort. So you'll find a lot of aerospace and

37:44.376 --> 37:49.063
mechanical engineering departments around the 
country.

37:52.823 --> 37:59.672
What would be the next largest aerospace programs 
after Texas A&M? Penn State has the next, as far as I

38:00.333 --> 38:05.820
know, undergraduate program. Our graduate 
program is not anywhere near the largest, and I'm

38:08.022 --> 38:18.696
not really sure who has the largest aerospace 
graduate program.

38:26.455 --> 38:29.818
Purdue also has a large, large department. Why do 
you think aerospace engineering doesn't attract

38:30.079 --> 38:36.786
as many students as some of the other engineering 
fields? There isn't as big a market for aerospace

38:36.806 --> 38:52.902
engineers as say mechanical or electrical

38:36.806 --> 38:52.902
and the enrollment kind of seeks its own level

38:54.603 --> 38:58.266
based on the marketability of the particular 
degree. Typically, we attract students that are

39:00.628 --> 39:10.778
enthused by airplanes and or the space program, 
things of that sort. Since the shuttle success, I

39:11.779 --> 39:16.983
expect to see an increase in our enrollment. Was 
Texas A&M involved in space shuttle research?

39:22.628 --> 39:24.390
Yeah, since about The date is uncertain, but we 
have been involved in the development of the

39:25.568 --> 39:47.778
configuration through wind tunnel tests, also 
involved in an evaluation of the damage tolerance

39:25.568 --> 39:47.778
of the tile system,

39:25.568 --> 39:47.778
and maybe some other lesser things. We're now 
involved in the development of a system to de-ice

39:49.280 --> 39:54.647
the main tank. of the launch vehicle. The fuel was 
liquid hydrogen. And whilst it's sitting on the

40:05.656 --> 40:10.342
pad, it accumulates a significant amount of ice. 
And during the launch sequence, that ice breaks

40:10.442 --> 40:16.089
loose and damages the tile. So NASA's interested 
in de-icing the tank whilst it's on the pad. And

40:24.019 --> 40:26.322
then you expect the space shuttle promote more 
research in this field in aerospace engineering.

40:30.828 --> 40:31.389
Oh, sure. Yeah, it'll be a continuing thing. Is 
there anything else that you'd like to say before

40:35.354 --> 40:37.678
we close? Don't think so. I believe that's about 
all I know to ask you. I appreciate you taking the

40:45.509 --> 40:48.974
time to talk with me. Okay. Thank you.
